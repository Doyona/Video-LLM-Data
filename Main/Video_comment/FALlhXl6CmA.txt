You've been requesting Conan for years, we've been chasing Conan for years, and the Hot Ones interview has finally arrived! What was your favorite moment?
Wow😳 that was some of the best comedic television I’ve ever seen…. Of course, maybe I do need to get out more😛😀
I only use affordable doctors.. great minds think alike 😂
His hair matches the wings.😂
Hands down the best one!
Brutal O'Brien
Wish granted Conan. It's HBO Max again.
You go boy Conan.
This is the best episode imo. Conan never disappoints.
How? How? Conan, you were the reason I watched late night back in the '90's ... thank you.
The quiff is epic
Conan is the liquor
I have been watching this for a long time. My girlfriend and I did the hot ones challenge at home, and  lived to tell the tale. So many great interviews and shows through the years,  but the Conan episode was the Best One Ever!
Brings his own , less than stellar physician hahahahahaha😂😂😂😂❤❤
Absolutely legend. The image of Conan, faced drenched with milk and hot sauce and raging up a storm, was wonderfully absurd. Very Ernie Kovacs. We need this, keep it up! Funny's where you find it.
There are millions of people in this world that would love to even have that lousy doctor😂😂😂
i pity the man's drycleaner
the background music does not match.
This is the ONE guest that the host could NOT keep up with!
This mf is amazing, so is the host
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
All time best interview
Wooow😂😂😂
All the coke
I have a new word for Nacogdoches...... 😂
two of the best. sean a great interviewer and how he lets conan redefine a role as guest.manic comedy at its best.
yesssss🎉❤ ❤
That was the greatest Hot Ones yet!!!!  Opposite Josh Brolins Sauce bravado I laughed and leughed.
The man is a Beast!   David Letterman Jon Stewart  Conan O’brien  Top 3 late night hosts of all time .✍️
Him waving that spice bottle at the end had me😅
This and Gordon are the only episodes I’ve rewatched
Conan is the owner of Hot Ones now. What a legend.
Bar far....my fave episode hahahahahahahhahha my goodness 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Best show ever. Ooooohhhhhyeahhhhhh
He’s so red 🤣🤣🤣 kudos on going through all the sauces, most of the guests tapped out mid way.
The greatest court jest to ever live: Conan O’Brien ❤️
ngl, i came back here over and over again just to see conan put the wings in his pocket.. AHAHAHAHHAHAHA
Sean looks like he's having the time of his life just watching Conan descend further and further into madness 🤣
Conan is the GOAT by one hundred thousands miles.
This episode is amazing and completely unhinged. Best one yet.
Hahahaha, Conan absolutely stole the show. An amazing person, the best host and a wholesome human being.
Well he looks fine
The dab of the decade!
Conan is insane, i love him
GINIUS!!!!!
The best guest ever!!!
Conan O' Brien is forever my favorite talk show host of all time
very well "prepared" episode
Here after Abhishek Upmanyu (the best Indian Standup artist) spoke about THIS on a podcast.
BEST.... EPISODE.... EVER
First time I saw a guest take over the show and the guest’s guest is the highlight. Amazing.
This was hilarious, I truly enjoyed this episode 😂😂😂😂😂
This really shows the difference between somebody highly educated and skilled at improv comedy like Conan and somebody who recites lines like Sean. He can't really keep up.
I didn't laugh. I yelled at him through most of it... "Don't do it! Stop it! What's wrong with you???" I was terrified that he was going to touch his eyes because he was acting insane. I love Conan but this episode made me a nervous wreck.
Best hot ones ever I would like to see him on first weekfiest
I think Conan just killed hot ones harder than anyone
Give us jordan
This is the greatest piece of internet history of all time
Absolutely amazing!!!!  Conan "Buffalo Wing" O'Brien is not only an amazing comedian/actor. This show episode is proof that he will do whatever it takes to get a comedy skit finished and funny!   Hats off to you, Conan. You are an inspiration and comedy master!  Best episode. Will not and cannot ever be bested. 🙏🤐🥴
bro i knew conan was funny cz he was my first snl type watch but i didn’t know he was this naturally funny. the end is killing me 🤣🤣🤣
The best😂
Even if u hate the guest BEST SHOW ❤EVER
Conan wipe your mouth!!!😂🎉🌋
Best episode best guest
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
20:57 Hahahahahah
Pure comedic gold!
He’s just to good man. Genius
0:02, 0:03
The best!
What a beast! 😆😆😆
I FU<KING LOVE CONAN
That was the best episode ever. I am crying with laughter.
"Charlie Rose show where you eat hot wings"
I need a Conan, Sean, Jordan Schlansky trio!
Conan O'Brien you are the man
IMHO the best episode for hot ones. Thank you Conan!
Conan is just doing side quests at this point.
Greatest hot ones ever. There's no one like conan! And bringing "Dr." Arroyo (who didn't go to med school but "should have") was icing on a crazy cake. 😂
Oh my goooooodddd he’s so funny
This is my all time fav episode lol
Insane 😂😂😂😂
The like to dislike ratio on this is literally over 200 to 1. Definitely the best one so far
My favorite show host of all time. No one can compare.
That finger wag "i dont fear your wings man" is so hilarious 😂
The "other guy" 😂😂😂 conan I love you
Obnoxious!
He is out of his mind 😂
Call the wife!!!
I love how Conan decided to go full on Robin Williams on this 😂 Conan is the best AND I feel old
It's the epic doom choir music playing while Conan's riffing about the Three Stooges that really seals in the flavor.
💀💀💀 Conan’s the man!
My eye lids and forehead are sweating by 17:13
i go back to this episode to have laughs conan you're a freaking legend !
Coming back to this iconic episode. Props to Conan O’Brien
I wasn't gonna watch cause I never thought much of him but he blew me away he looks like my Irish grandpa I never met he was the best on this show
Best episode ever!
I dont know how ive never seen this. Best episode of the whole show. This will never be topped.
I'm almost upset Sean didn't mirror the guest on this one 😂
Best episode EVER!!!!!!
I find it hilarious that Conan started with his tie tighten, and became loose at wing 10. His crash out reminded me of Rick telling Morty they’re going on for how many seasons Rick said as he was spitting everywhere.
This was epic. Best guest.
Pure greatness
Conan went from being a pale white man to being a very red man with very watery juicy pink lips and eyes, covered in orange sauce and spit
23:00 for future use
This episode shows how Conan is a perfect cast for the Joker in the DCU
Back here for more Dr. Arroyo
By far the most hilarious one yet
And now it's back to HBO Max LOL 3:29
Thank you Conan. You are a very entertaining performer.
7:19 that's got to be a badge of honor for Sean, being told by one of the Kings of Late Night that he's good at interviewing.
Of course Conan and Bill Murray would be the best and Dj whoever would be the worst!!!
Absolute beast 😂
I knew this was going to be bad.
Conan is delightful to watch! Thanks for this iconic episode
By far the most unique interview I’ve ever had the pleasure of witnessing
23:25 for real Conan looks like a crackhead tweaking
I watched it few times and I’m in stitches laughing. Definitely the funniest and most memorable episode.
9:30 him calling the doctor and saying his pocket is getting full made me laugh so hard
Complete bell end
Conan is a Zombie?  THIS WAS SOOO AWESOME!!! CONAN RULES, MAN!
The background music is terrible
Don’t be such snob! Read Chaucer!😂
I love conan❤
He officially won Gold Medals in the show history
Honestly, still the BEST Hotones episode ever.....
Can we get Conan back??
Did I just watch Conan put a wing in his pocket? LOL
I kept re-watching this. One of the best episode of Hot Ones.
Conan is my favorite talk show host because he keeps it always a good time with his staff, and doesn’t go political, he’s just the best !! Good bless you Conan
I love conan, but man oh man the ending was hard to watch.
favorite episode hands down
What I notice is that conan can make every single minute interesting. Even the most boring statements is interesting
100% eat brought me here.
lost it when conan was going on his profound monologue about comedy and the camera pans down to the destruction and hot sauce slowly pouring 🤣🤣23:51
Conan O'Brien is by far the greatest guest EVER!!😂❤
The more spicy it gets the more weird and crazy he become
Bro how????!
23:51 de bomb just randomly dripping on the table 😂
Conan ran circles around him. That was awesome.
The best of the best ❤😂
I absolutely love this guy ❤
One of the funnyest ones I’ve seen yet
I just hope he didn't go straight to bathroom  🥵
Absolutely BRILLIANT!!!   Thank you Conan
😟sean vs 😀conon o brian
Gross
You could see Connan face get more red but i dont know how he is keeping together.
Heart of a lion
Dude got wasted on hot sauce! 😂
"braggadocious" "this whole show is a bit" nah
Conan treated this like one big SNL skit, genius and he did commit to the bit!
The wings in the pocket had me dying!!! 😆
i love u conan
Conan really “Man among boys’ed” every other guest 😂
most sauce I've seen someone have yet,  my mouth started to water just watching.
peak peak peak
I can't help but notice that Sean didn't do his "I do what you do" thing in this episode....
This video should be the most viewed one on this channel no one had done it better than Conan
His eyes are going red but he still won't give up! And still talking quite very intelligibly!
he destroyed the show goat
The mood changes after the water buffalo story.. Who is the interviewer and what happened to his feelings?
This will remembered as one of his finest moments.
Fake but funny
The best episode yet! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Conan is the goat
Conan is so fun to watch, hilarious 😂 👏
This is my all time favorite hot ones episode
Love Conan. Nobody has a better resume.
I try to watch new ones. Get bored always end up back here
Officially say that this is the one hot ones episode that did the impossible it made me a fan of the person that was being interviewed. That is genuinely impressive.
so many likes. this episode is pure gold
Conans chilled reaction of madness- the best Hot Wings show ever been & he dominated it!
Crazy conan😂
😂
He always talks about mirroring hisnguests well yeah he didnt even try on this one.
😂😂😂
Conan is someone that everyone seems to love. It is inexplicable to me. To me, I see someone trying too hard to be funny and center of attention. Sean did his best but really this is a tornado of not funny and unlike the other episodes no real talk. Boo
We have a Conan gift pack. The mug is sacred.
Actually the GOAT!
Putting the “doctor” in there was a nice touch definitely a Conan level of humor and I bet he set that whole bit up for the show 😂
I've never laughed so hard in my life.
Pretty fly for a white guy
I'm a Hot Ones fan and a big Conan fan and this is the best episode ever.
I love CoCo sm ❤
Best hot ones episode ever! Conan is a comedy genius!
I was never much of a fan of Conan's; however,  I sure am now! What a pro! Awesome!
It's up there w the Coolio episode as the other God tier one
Epic show 🤣😂🤣😂
this episode feels unjust at 14M views... deserves to be in the top 5 IMO. WHAT'S THE POINT OF BEING ALIVE IF WE CAN'T DO THIS?!?!?
BRVAO! 👏 😂😂😂😂
My favorite episode of all time even better then ramzies
Conan was never funny... Have  no idea why anyone thought he deserved a comedy show.
Omfg...😂😅 im dying. Best one ever!!!!
Conan!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤ We need you now!!❤❤❤
I give him this.  He can hang.   Wonder how long he was in the hospital after that! 😝
This gotta be by far the most entertaining episode of all! Wow!
16:55
C'mon that's Danny Kaye ❤️
Call the wife 😂😂😂
This might be the best ever performance.... hall of fame for sure "im hard for the first time in 15 years, call the wife" 😂😂😂😂😂
He drank a candle so he could handle the hot sauce like Homer
This man is an absolute gift to mankind.   Conan has been heroic since day ONE.
This can't be real...he doesn't even miss a beat
Incredibly rewatchable.
This absolutely amazed me. Conan doesn't even eat hot stuff. He doesn't use hot sauce. I do use hot sauce a lot, on a lot of things, but if I dumped one of those super hot ones on anything and then ate it, I would be sincerely scared of what was going to happen, and of getting through it. My throat would be pretty much guaranteed to close up, I would start coughing.  I wouldn't be able to talk much if I wanted to. Conan opened the bottle and dumped it all over the wing, then ate the entire wing, then took a swig straight from the bottle, then sat and thought for a minute and said, "...nah...not gettin' anything.".  HAAAA!  Hilarious.  This was like a feat of strength and daring, combined with a great comedic performance.   He cashed the huge check that he wrote at the beginning of the show. This was big time.
🤣
There's no way this was real. He was using stunt sauce bottles. Nothing hotter than a supermarket sweet chilli there.
I fking love Conan 😂😂😂😂
I suggest you read A Confederacy of Dunces by William Kennedy Toole. The funniest book I have ever read.
It's September 28, 2025. I thought my favorite episode was Lorde, but not anymore. Conan is a GOD !!!!!
The BEST EPISODE EVER !!!!!!!
I love Conan
World class interviewing. You really took your time to research Conan and it shows. The last question about history of comedy was the best because he is passionate about it which nailed the ending. Seriously. Interviewer killed it
By far the best guest on any show of this kind , EVER :D I just love Conan
All the brilliance aside, I wonder how his assh*le was later that night.
Simply the best thing on YouTube... ever.
Love you Coco
What a legend 🙌🙌🙌
I pitty him during his next #2
Much more funny than Kimmel
Looks at Conan: I just got this
Conan carried ts dawg
Conan is awesome!
10 ads in one video might be a new record that's wild
8:10 great advice for showbiz
4:37 Proof that Sydney Sweeney is a nepo
Easily the best one ever
Instagram brings me back to this episode!!! Effective!!! 😉😌👍🏼
22:30 Legend
21:06 And this is when Chris Farley briefly possessed Conan. 😅
Crazy 🎉🎉😂😂
I keep checking this video to see when it’ll hit 15 MILLION views ❤
rewatching this. best episode ever
Conan gave some real good advice if you listened.
22:39 the pure fear in his eyes
Easily the best episode
Absolute legend of showbiz.
This was amazingly unhinged. I am dying 😂🤣
Conan!!!!!!!! I’m concerned
17:41  im dead 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The mediocre leader is the one who let the river flow and evolves alongside. Damming it damns something.
Red all over😂
Lips are brighter than his hair😂
This is one of the best, if not THE best, episodes I've watched. Great and fantastic job.
Every time Conan plays with his hot sauces I’m like “bro stop please your killing me 😂”
When I hear Conan say “Max” I’m thinking he’s referring to Max Weinberg! lol
He is the man!!
Too crazy
Does anyone want to say warren g Harding got pushed by a crime lord? A letter saying I can't then death shortly after? That's typical crime wave
He’s unbelievable
Yea, probably the best hot ones ever filmed haha.
It's funny; Conan has told us more than once his affinity for Popeye's saying I am what I am. Just before him saying, I was trying to a way to say exactly that. I dont think there is anything more fitting to put on his gravestone, 3 months from now. Way more than most, Conan lets the people around him see him for who he is. One of the most unique and funny people Ive ever seen. Shame he wont last much longer.
The algorithm demanded I watch this again and who am I to argue
Easily the best guest EVER!
Conan takes the crown from Key & Peele for funniest HOT ONES segment!
I think he can be a better actor
Lol, COB is the best.
4:50 Umm, the reindeer over there didn't want me to play their games. :/ I know I'm on thin ice here. I'd make more jokes about this place, but that'd be cold.
1 year later and it's still hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
Call the wife!!! Has me in tears
Absolute legend
Conan controlling the show, his Late Night Host will never die
“Was it a four year university?” “It was supposed to be”
“I said it, and Ghandi said it. And Popeye”
To Think, This man, is Funny And Irish... I Was Right About One Thing.
"Something the matter, Sean? Came expecting to eat wings with a madman, and faced A GOD."
conan gotta work on not talking over people all the time tho
15:00 so he manifested the job
"he has a....office in the desert" hahahahh
This is the most unhinged episode of all time ❤
Is there an episode with Anthony Bourdain?
Best. Hot Ones. Ever.
This is Conan's masterpiece.
" never saw a spice until I was 52 years old"
My ex didn't get this was a joke. Like didn't understand Conan's shtick. Hope she is enjoying her cat.
This is by far the funniest and engaging one of them all.
Conan is the only celebrity I wish I could meet and this episode was incredible!
I’ve watched this at least 4 times, it never gets old!  Hilarious
Yup, had to come back to this one.
Fkn legendary!!  Gotta love it 🤌😂
It's my favorite episode ever. Conan is da man, hands down!!
Classic Conan! Absolutely love his comedic genius..
did he just...put the wing in his...oh god
Hot
This puts him on Mt Rushmore
Good god. Just putting that stuff on his face alone ...
eat more than nibbles next time if you wanna claim champion status, conan.
I’m sweating just watching this
Perfect half hour. Close it down; it doesn’t get a single atom better than this
Too bad y'all couldn't get norm on before he passed. He would've been a great guest.
Conan you rule 😂
The guest of all time, watched this the whole way thru usually I just skip to the end lol
my favourite episode!
The greatest hot ones episode ever.
Conan Nut case. Its a bit of your whole life! just a bit.  Curly was better
Conan is ADHD in a person personified
He referred to Jay Leno as "the other guy", right?
That man is UNHINGED 16:57  and I am HERE FOR IT
This might be one of the most impressive ones.. incredible
The fact you can see the actual admiration from sean when he says incredible as conan is drinking hot sauce
I just watched this episode. Best one out of all. I couldn't stop laughing.
Conan missed his opportunity to say that the Water Buffalo who threw him was in the studio with them. He was on his plate.
He tried the sauce - and conquered the sauce
Mad and Cracked magazines got me though some seriously bad parts of my life... Comedy saved my life more than I can count, I even used to stay up late watching Conan to forget about the day and just laugh.
This is THE best Hot Ones Episode
This is the most Aries interview I've ever seen
da bo mb inal is plenty of heat for me hes tough
You awakened the beast
conan followed leno for 15+ years and I like to think leno watched this and said "I can't follow that"
Conon is Crazy I love it
LONG LIVE CONAN O'BRIEN
Conan O'brien is GOAT❤😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Its so funny he asked a out what they talk about when their mics are off right befire commercial. Ive wondered about thst for years
The aggressive double-sip straight from the bottle took me out. I'm dead. 🤣😭
He's so wild 😂
He has natural red hair, of course he can handle heat better than most.
Why am I just watching this? 😂
this makes me wish I'd watched Conan on late night 😹😹😹
“Did you ever graduate 🤨He’s gone 😧”
Conan is so off the chain extreme that for the first time in the entire history of Hot Ones, Sean didn't match everything the guest did (ie if the guest drinks water/milk etc Sean follows suit, if the guest takes multiple bites, Sean does, etc). I was surprised that at 13:42 Sean didn't pour extra and/or drink from the hot sauce bottle 😂🔥🍻
Its so nice to have Sean in Conan's show
Best Arroyo line: 25:40
You know Conan actually does pretty well with da bomb compared to most guests. He also poured extra on it
Best episode. Conan is king
Conan is a legend!
I have never seen a whole hot ones video in all the years since it's inception, until now. Beautiful message Conan Sir. Thank you.
Is there a hot ones champion record... like Conan vs undertaker is it close
Best Ever
Not me screaming "Conan!" when drinking the hot sauce!!
Conan: Where did you go to school? Dr: In 1998 😂😂😂
The part where he is talking about what to read is one of the most inspiring comedy moments I’ve ever seen.
COnan knocks me out.  SLoppy eater though.
Conan o'brian  The only guests feet to touch the floor
Before you watch this, educate yourself on DJ Khalid’s attempt
Can we get a shout out to the doctor? He threw away some great one liners throughout the show.
Please tell me there is an interview  with Conan after this!!!
First time I’ve ever watched a full episode of hot ones with multiple rewinds. Not even the Undertaker. I skimmed through thay
Yes sir
Entertainment at its finest! Conan is that guy!
Everyone knows even the most cockiest of guests always get taken out by da bomb so once he started pouring that on his wing…I was thinking he is gonna regret that quickly.
Conan is the best of all of em man
13:40 goes off
Would be awesome if you ask the Actors&Actresses, to answer how the rest of thems day was 😅😂
Love Conan
does he not drink water the whole time? im 14 mins in and that glass is full brother
Ya know, the more I revisit this clip, the more I begin to notice how peculiar it is that Conan insists on keeping his wings in his pocket. After the first time, it's not funny anymore. What is he afraid of? DNA can be extracted from the mouth. Is Conan secretly afraid of his DNA getting into the wrong hands. Casually making it as a "bit" but all the while hiding in plain sight that he doesn't trust to leave it on the table.?  Why would he be concerned about this? Does anyone else have a strange vibe about this?? And what might it allude to?
He is so Irish that he can't feel spice.
what a crazy gramps he is😂😂. its so nice
Conan is so awesome
My favorite comedian
Gotta do one with Adam Ray as Doctor Phil! Non stop amazing questions back and forth
There doesn't seem to be "another" Conan. He alway's seems to be switched on 100%
Conan went harder than Eric Andre what
A cat brought me here!
Love it!!!
Are Conan and Maya Rudolph the house only ones who’ve kinda made a bit outta their episode?? 🤔. Hilarious either way👏👌👍
please live long conan
Best one for sure
Wingdrop!!!
Dr. Arroyo is a 2-time Emmy award-winning comedy writer. We saw him like 3 times. Conan always on his A-game.
incredable
I love that Max has now gone back to HBO Max 🤣
Conan is my FAVORITE!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The toilet bowl felt the pain as well.
So very subtly put a lot into that clearing the throat at 19:32.
Absolute legend
I have to agree.  Don Quixote is one of the few books that made me laugh out loud.
Iconic.
🤣🤣😂😂🙃😉😊🙂🙃😁😁😃😃😀
i will leave now know play on words intended good day sirs
but i had a job ate on the road alot you know probably once
sorry it is like 1 kinda
the drips are hotter out
i talk way 2 much
auqua man was worried
conan the barbarian not 2
i was on the road alot there was alot of resteraunts probly
then i wiped my but walked again back to bed awe awe the sun
i had to go to work every day my pleaser im a bad speller
a little panic where am i
the tingling in the legs wakes up
get ready for 3 am wake up legs numb on the toilet seat circulation
That was a impressive as disgusting...
Greatest to ever do it.
The Magnum Opus of First We Feast
You should go😂😂😂😂
That is exactly how that would go. I was watching Conan before this clown was born. I like clowns.
Best hot ones ever😂
His skin tone progeessed from untanned Irish to Donald Trump
One of the most brilliant performances I've ever seen
Hiji on ill find it soon
Hahaha 🤣 I hereby say that Conan is the craziest human being on earth The fact that he didn't have no reaction to the hot sauces and even consuming the hot sauce itself this guy has no taste buds whatsoever it's seriously scary he had no reaction drinking da bomb hot sauce itself He's a menace of the human society and the fact that he compliment Sean Evans as a great interviewer has to be the highest compliment of all time Conan is a freaking legend that will never be forgotten and I'm happy he's still alive today😅
where is conan's tastebuds, no seriously is nobody gonna point this out
By far the best episode I've seen! Conan went absolutely insane!
sean: conan pleaseee stop!!! 😂😂😂😂
this made me shiggle
I'm perfectly fine while tears and saliva flows all over
"Dr. Ro royo, check for pulse" "It's there"   Peak
This was is my favorite! Conan and Rose’… for different reasons of course. She was a precious jewel and my man here is classic funny and badass for drinking hot sauce
I think he won.
Conan the Barbarian! He came and CONQUERED
“What’s wrong with me, why can’t I feel?!?!”  😂😂😂
dude this is by far the best one iv ever seen.
3:20 neither could Warner Bros, so they changed it back
He bathed in hot sauces! Forever an Icon.
The “I’M FINE” had me laughing with tears, as he was also because of the extremely hot sauce. Such confidence
The man is a gotdamn legend!
Props to homie
Just rewatched it and my eyes are running from laughing like I've had a big swig of da bomb™
Finland mentioned! Torilla tavataan perkeleeee!!!!🫡🫡 What's awesome is that one of the best and funniest talk show guys says your interviewing skills are spectacular
wow
if dr. arroyo's first name is actually nick...
2:13  “I don’t fear your wings, man.  Bring what you got, ok!?” (Conan O’Brien)  … and he certainly meant it❗️
oh my god even on my 2nd watch this is so f funny
This man is such a part of my childhood he has a special place in my heart love you Conan ❤❤❤
Thank god max is now hbo max, thank you conan
ROFL what's in your pocket Dr. Arroyo? :D
How many of the hot ones guests have been to Epstein Island or Diddy parties. Your loveable idols and heroes are all pedophilic reptilians . ❤
Conan really got lost in the sauce
Hot sauce and a monorail. The guys comedic talents are boundless.
This is the absolute best episode of hot ones that I have ever watched. I have seen so many but Conan was an absolute hero on the show and it was fantastic to watch. I loved it.❤
My favorite so far.
Legend
oh hey its the death stranding guy😊
Sean Evans should reboot “Inside The Actors Studio” and replace the great James Lipton.  He would do a great job.
I wish they had shown a photo of that bruise he got from the water buffalo.  It was a beauty.
Conan is an absolute G
Grossed out and impressed at the same time lol
I can bet all his audacity comes out the next morning!!!😂
He looks like jb smoove and scoop dogg 's Girlfriend 😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah it's there.
The best hot ones episode ever!
Conan really got into it. This is so unhinged and hilarious! 😂😂😂
Everyone becomes Tom Green eventually
He is genuinely one of the funniest human beings to ever exist imo, absolute legend of Comedy and in just general also this is possibly the greatest episode of Hot ones ever and its all down to the amazing red head.
Oh yeah, he's Irish.
I believe the HOT ONES really peaked here. No guest can ever touch this level.
Da bomb is the water buffalo. 🐃
Wow!  Just caught this episode.  He is Wing boss of bosses.  Never seen a guest who just dominated the show with comedic bravado.  Best episode ever.  😂 🔥 wings
I've always had an unhealthy crush on Conan and this just made it that much worse. Such a legend
Conan the only guest to come on hot ones and absolutely STEAL THE SHOW 😂😂😂
Sean met your match and I’m not gonna lie you lost this one fair and square buddy 😂. Conan is the absolute GOAT of talk shows
Conan INVADED the whole show!! He really put 110% maybe even more🥵 Best episode, best guest.. Respect...  Sean Ewans (and crew) is one of the best interviewer and that compliment coming from Conan is priceless❤
The three stooges sounds ended me. Classic conan
3:18 Aged like that milk on the table
Did Conan use Homer's tongue wax coating hack?
This must be in the time capsule for the future aliens to judge humanity....😂😂
The questions are perfect. Feels like I know Conan as a friend. This is the best episode by far.
too gross to look at for me-- get him a napkin!
Mad irish man lol
I feel like Conan would jump out of an airplane without a parachute if he knew it would get laughs.😂
Conan is a legend man i miss his shows…
that finland episode still turned out great!
I haven't seen anyone crush the sauce like him.
Conan = GOAT
This is the greatest interview ever
LOL Conan is the best dude. LOL
Conan is the Goat
Mmm I could really eat some chicken wings right now I like the sound of those smoky and jalapeño ones 🤤🤤🤤
For a wise and stable man! 😂
Conan is the greatest entertainer of all time. Thus, this episode became the greatest Hot Ones and will never be topped. God is pleased.
This is my go to video if I need a guaranteed laugh. Conan is the best.
Conan is truly a man who *SUFFERS* for his art.
i love conan, not even half way in and he's taunting sean about how easy it is to eat the wings. i wonder how many guests have done that, and then ofcourse, regretted it later
Y tf am i not turned on by this
this the most exciting & the funniest episode of the hot one's ❤😊
Legendary episode 🙌🏽
Conan O'Brien the God of comedy and Lord of hot chicken wings.... ❤😊😂🎉
Conan's commitment to the bit is unmatched.
shaun has the look on his face like he's gonna die on the last wing
He understood the assignment so well, he turned in next term’s assignment.
Dude. This is without a doubt the hardest I have ever laughed while watching this show. Connan knows comedy. Him stressing his regret with da bomb bout took me out. 😂
What a LEGEND.
This is total insanity. Conan for the win!
That last speech about how comedy is everywhere was genuinely a really powerful monologue that I could see being performed in a theatre
I love seeing Sean letting Conan take the wheel and having a ball. Him completely breaking at 22:59 is HILARIOUS
If they ever need a new host for this show....
Conan is the boss!
Conan survived all this only because of his doctor. He is really good
BEST EVER. ❤
Does Conan have the same makeup artist as Trump?? 😂😂
Out of all the late night show hosts, I have the upmost respect for Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien.  They truly care about entertaining their fans with legit comedy rather than wasting their time with liberal political nonsense.
This is history,  im amazed after watching 10 times,  Conan is top 10 ever entertainers.   😅
He gets home to his wife and empties his pocket of chicken bones on the dinner table. Brought you leftovers
I had to read the Canterbury tales by chaucer. Conan is right, it has humorous themes. Peoplw are intimidates by the classics however dont let that deter you feom being well read.
The doc bit was hilarious
Dang i needed this laugh im.getting ready for work and im literally crying laughing  Thank you!!!!!!
Hats off, Conan went all in, crushed it
simply the best episode theyve ever made
Absolute legend!
this one is the best episode ever
Absolutely genius!!!
This was a great hot ones !!!!❤👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Iconic
da bomb an he lil oh ther a lil bit there lol
conan ruined this show for me. that being said it did get played out years ago
This Conan guy is such an engaging speaker! He should get his own show!
Best one by far no one comes close just wow
Best hot ones ever
Watching this again, many times over, Conan is the goat
Greatest hot ones ever Gordon Ramsey got nothing on Conan
Bro Conan is so right when he tells Sean “this isn’t a bit this is your show” this is Sean’s show his legacy own it bro dispite the condor being kinda goofy this show is right there and basically the YouTube version of the late night show format hot ones is way more than a bit
The fn goat
Gordon Ramsay & Conan O'brien to Hot Ones is what Michael Caine & Tim Curry are to Muppet movies. Either going in straight or embracing it wholeheartedly but with equal levels of integrity & respect to the form
Conan sweating and drooling by the end did it for me lol. This is the best episode of hot ones.
Conan got toon force power over the tv
“Very good, very inexpensive” makes me think of dr. Michael from John mulaneys special😂
He will definitely be missed when he is gone!! 😢
Conan is a menace 😂
I love him so much, a true king!
I love Conan🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 always the greatest ❤️
somehow this episode is very, very boring. Not Conan's antics but the interview.
Disgusting clown.
GOAT
4:21 Sean said, “take ownership of that side of the table”   And Conan really took that personally
Conan is the all-time champ.
Conan is a One of A Kind   Go For It!  Fearless Guy
Can always count on Conan to make me laugh.
Im confused. Does he just like spicy food too???
Best episode so far 😁 loved it .
I love how on wing 9 there was no question. Just Conan being conan
I've been to a hot ones store where they sold all the hot sauces, i tried everything, and everything was fine, except... da bomb. That thing was really nasty, it did not taste good at all, and it was extraordinarily hot, I had one small drop of it and it hurt me for like 15 mins, and this is coming from a person who loves to eat spicy food all the time. I can't imagine how Conan must've felt after having that much of it.
Conan an absolute beast 😅
Sad that Bear Grylls got any light given he was just a cheap copy of Les Stroud.
Da Bomb for da Boss 🔥 boy he’s beyond insanity !!!
Da Bomb for da Boss 🔥 boy he’s beyond insanity !!!
Truly the most iconic Hot Ones episode of all time 🙏
I love Conan 💚 I’ve watched this multiple times
How can he not get used to Max?  Wasn't that his drummers name for years on NBC?
By far the funniest episode to date. I’m crying 😂 bravo Conan
Sometimes, Conan strikes me as an attention seeker...
give him 4 Oscar academy
He is completly nuts
When Conan comes to your show, it becomes Conan's show
I've said Warren G. Harding was the worst president for 2 decades. I'm thankful for Conan.
What a legend
“So, my question to you…”  😂
Unhinged interview
Best guest ever. committing to the weakness of the sauce and poring extra is crazy.
What a sport! This is peak entertainment! And Conan did not disappoint! Sooo gooooood!
Conan O'Brien is the GOAT!
“to quote my hero, popeye-”  BYE LOL
The funniest interview by far on this show.
@4:25, Shawn had no idea how deep he was foreshadowing. 😳😳😳😂😂😂
"I never saw a spice until I was about 52 years old." -Conan
The “hilarious “…..
Amazing!
The worst episode yet… wow
What the f***.
Just watched this for the umpteenth time. Truly one of the greatest pieces of media I have ever consumed.
Conan always owns the room… and I’m SO ok with that.
18:07 First time hearing Sean's first uncontrollable laugh
there should be blue cheese
uhhh i re watched.. . . and I think I laughed harder this time. what a GAOT
Pure Entertainer
11:50 cant believe Conan didnt make a Hot Pockets joke
Conan is a comedic genius!
6:24 Conan's reference to Jay Leno: The other guy...I don't know where he was... 😂😂😂
He took antiacids and coating agents before the show and possibly night before
he was giving Rick from Rick and Morty vibes
Sean thinking on the other side  I have to be careful with guests next time😂😂
Best episode for sure
So funny! Watched second time and even funnier
Ok I get it Conan , fully commit.
Thank you Conan ❤
This is just off putting honestly lol
This is perfect.. democrat mouthpiece cant feel
Conan might be the goat
Is Dr. Arroyo taking new patients?
He’s never funny just gross.
He actually freaking drank the hottest sauce..pretty sure nobody else did that
Came back to this to let everyone know they changed it back to HBO Max.
This was absolute comedy GOLD
Dang Conan destroyed Hot Ones, he made hot ones his biotch😂
This interview made me love Conan even more
Staged. Heavy editing. Constantly putting his covered fingers near eyes but host not warning....something smells fishy. Great energy though.
This is the best episode ever!
Conan runs circles around Fallon
This episode ruined the hot ones for me. It wasn't bad. It just set such a high standard in terms of both content and durability that every time I watch literally anyone else, I think, nah Conan did it million times better. Can't blame the others because Conan is that mf in a billion
Conan ❤😂❤😂❤ simply the best ever on Hot Ones 🔥
Holy bologna….Conan just might have the best strategy to combat spicy food: hire a ‘doctor’ to check vitals and lie about it, and ride the heat wave to the point of insanity.
I expected Conan to say water buffalo makes good BBQ
Phenomenal
24:15 - Conan channeling a perfect Master Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force !!!
13:57 If you actually sit there drinking hot sauce YOU WILL NEED A DOCTOR and perhaps an exorcist in your bathroom.
Conan is the man!
Oh Conan, in Ireland our meat and dairy has taste.
I wonder at what point the production crew became concerned they were going to have a legit medical emergency. Because I feel like they crossed that line at some point.
I can't believe that monster killed acting and comedy legend Bea Arthur!!
Amazing episode.
It's just Conan 🙅‍♀
Thanks Canada
Conan is crayyyyyyy
Is Conan scared someone is going to harvest his DNA from the chicken wings he bit? Why is he saving them lol
To this day 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤟🏽😝😝😆😆😆💯‼️🎯
can´t beat conan. period. "call the wife"
Love it!  The best one ever done!  Conan is crazy!😂
Trying to hard. Too much.
It's so sad there is no one like Conan coming up.
This episode just made me subscribe to the channel😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That was too much for Sean
Guys…I just looked up micky mouse cast…and the person who voiced Minnie actually died!😢
I’ve seen this so many times and it is so f crazy. He had to have had some science help him. There is no way
He’s not here to take part. He’s here to take over.
This is, by far, hands down, bar none, the BEST Hot Ones I’ve ever seen
3:16 he's right, it's definitely not a better name lol similar to how Twitter should always be called Twitter.
Conan rules.  Such a great comedian.   I wish I could see him more on stuff
Conan a BEAST!! 😂
Conan went full robin Williams and crushed it
Oh my God!
This is so unhinged and I love him for this haha
I love this!!!
I dont like Conan, but to each their own.
Absolutely hilarious 😂
Sean in every episode: I usually mirror what the guest is doing.  Conan: I am what I am  Sean:
Conan needs to come back!!!
This will forever be the best Hot Ones
🤣
This is pure chaos. Do it again.
Disgusting 🤢 at least chew and swallow and not open your mouth while you eat
Willing to suffer to deliver entertainment.. Conan is a True artist.
All hail Conan!!! I tip my cap to you sir!!
Conan is a beast!
2:20 spoken like a true Irishman
How has it been over a year?!?!?!
The first and only rewatch of an episode of this show. Conan was a barbarian on this episode.
24:12 love how the bottles are just actively pouring out while he monologues
What a legend
He’s ok guys
conan broke sean
Call the Wife!
E-PIC, INCREDIBLE, WOW
Legend
13:34 the doctor be like (I can't anymore Conan)
I like how he called Jay Leno "The Other Guy" lol
This is one of the best episodes ever, Very Euphoric!
Just a mess.
This is my goat cold ones episode 😅😂
I was literally screaming when Conan was just chugging the sauces!!!
Comic legend. May be the GOAT. On a short list of "anyone you can meet, dead or alive." They say you shouldn't meet your idols but you just know Conan wouldn't disappoint in the least.
Conaaaaan
"my intestines have turned into acid" hahahahahahahahaaa this dude
That was pure comedy gold, I nearly died laughing. This should come with a health warning.
😳 this one isn't going to be topped.....wow just wow 👏🏻
The most legendary episode ever
Dr arroyo checking his blood pressure through his throat 7:44
Best guest ever
A pure showman, supper dedicated person. Great show from this pure professional, from capital letter “P”.  He is on his place, truly deserves his place!
Not gonna try to beat this. 😂
Conan destroyed this show, will never not be able to think of Conan when I think of the last dab or any of this.
Conan has always been my favorite host.  Truly a Mad Genius!
Gingers really freak me out.
Hands down, the best Hot Ones episode to date. It has amazing rewatch value. Conan is both witty and ridiculous, and also gives serious and meaningful answers to the great questions being asked.
can i keep these? is giving Napoleon dynamite with the tots vibes
10/9 best episode 🎉😂
can we ever have him come on again? please??
Hands down the best Hot Ones appearance ever. No one will ever beat Conan O'Brien. Absolute legend!
Conan is making a big mistake disrespecting the wings
Conan the Conqueror, Best. Show. Ever.
Conan broke the show man. That's it.
This was amazing!
love you connan
Conan is the best, he really commits.
Absolute warrior at spice conquest
wow what a nut!
Two of the best at what they do right here
Improv with a sheet of ice is basically the job description of weather reporters
Easily the funniest episode of all time..
Best ever!  Conan is the king of hot ones! LONG LIVE THE KING OF LATE NIGHT!
whats with the background sound???
Conan is the only person in Hollywood who is still loved after being exposed as a creep
21:09 the moment Conan looses his feathers
So when do we get Letterman? I would pay money for that one.
I wish they do one with Tom Green or Jim Carrey
Love Conan
Absolutely hilarious!  The only thing equally funny is hearing Conan talk on his Podcast about what the sauces did to his digestive system the next day.
Conan is the best host hot ones has ever had
Conan is a living comedy legend.
When the doctor choked him HAHAHAAHH😭
He brought on his own doctor 😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🥹 i love Conan so muchhh❤
Conan summed up why I rarely watch this show. Youre a great interviewer, so why the gimmick. You dont need it, and it gets in the way
The state of the table, bottles all knocked over and spilling out ..... 😂😂😂😂😂
Conan completely dominated. Anytime he gets in front of a camera he takes control and delivers an amazing and entertaining performance. Even at his age he came  in and basically ran the show for Sean. My only question is what did they cut out on one of those last wings there. They didn't even show Sean asking a question. Something must have gone down and I need to know what it was!
This is already an year ago???? Where da time go man 😭😭
Conan is the best! 👍🏻
this is the best interview ever made!!!!!!!!!!
23:35 I can fully vouch for conan, there IS comedy in the old testament (Book of Numbers)
This Episode should have more views.
Conan talked about bringing his A game every night and then he walked the walked.  My favorite episode!
He's so unhinged. I love it
My favorite episode ❤ Conan you are pure genius 😂❤
This is the best Hot Ones episode of all time. I've watched in 3 times already.
Conan told y'all to vote Biden and to visit haiti (haiti home of the Ax gang now btw.)  this guy is a fraud, anti american, anti white. of course, he is himself, but like all celebs, paid to be against and he did.
3:35 coming back to this after the re-re-brand of MAX is a gem. "its not like its a better name"
He is so funny
That man is insane. Why do people praise him?
Wow. I  am sweating and I just ate icecream  2 mins ago.
☃️☃️☃️☃️☃️☃️☃️☃️
If only we could get Jordan Schlansky on Hot Wings.
This is why Conan is a legend
Can’t think of a better guy, entertainer, guest or friend I would have on my show
there was something in conan's mouth during the show , i wonder if he noticed
Conan: I'm fine  Narrator (Morgan Freeman): Actually, Conan was not fine, in any sense of the word.
This was spectacular!
Is Conan still alive today? 😂
Conan is just a silly goofball and I'm all for it
Still so good.
LEGENDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Long live conan the hot sauce barbarian!!!!!! Absolutely brilliant showman and an all-time great human being. Favorite episode ever!!!!!!
<3 Conan <3
Re-watch this for the 4tn time lol
you can see the color in his face change.
This hits differently.
One year later I have never ever laughed so hard at this show....LEGEND
Best show ever!😂
_"You can't stop me from being who I am!_ _This is not a bit, this is _*_LIFE!!!!"_*  He is the Tom Cruise of Talk Show Hosts because this mission should be impossible! Literally one of my all-time favourite YouTube videos EVER!
Conan O'Brien's self deprecating humor does not work anymore that well because he is not only smart, but he is proving in this video that he is a tough guy too. :)
Conan effing rules
Public service statement,  if lobster smells fishy its probably bad
Im watching this again, because its so epic
Watching him is like watching some OG classic figures who did everything flawless with sweat and blood like Chaplin, Douglas, Hitchcock , Wilder and the list is go on a true legend god bless you
Dude watched every single episode of Walker Texas Rangers (in 20 second bouts); he can take anything.
He used to be a Simpson writer, maybe he used the Homer technique, like he did :D Iron belly man Conan, wau :D :)
I love this show but i promise i will never watch another episode. We're at the top of the mountain and i never want to climb down.
Conan should be commended for “leaving it all on the field” here— he did everything but wipe his eyes with hot sauce on them. Dude’s NUTS 😳
Sean seemed legitimately scared at certain points
“No effect on Conan” as he’s crying delusional
Why the questions about Presidents?
I remember in the early 90s when Howard Stern would every day predict his demise and he would actually call him up and talk to him and tell him he was gonna get canceled and just torture him. But Conan showed him he’s on hot ones drooling all over himself and Howard is everything he once despised
I came here because Jordan shalansky mentioned this episode 😂🎉
There should be a show called, Hot ones the morning after.
Holy Sh#$!! This made my week. 😂😂😂
This isn’t funny
Sean needs to ask him why he's a bad tipper even though hes almost a billionaire
This episode mis-titled. Dr Arroyo steals the show!!
I love Conan, he’s smart he’s funny and engages with his surrounding with spontaneity
I’m crying😂. Conan is one of a kind. He is the best.
3:20 This is why Max went back to HBO Max. Conan couldn’t get used to it
He is the best
Well deserved compliment Sean ❤🙏🏼
HAHAHAHAH CONAN YOU!!! THE BEST!!!!
Sneaky YT. I haven't thought of Bea Arthur in decades since watching the Golden Girls because of my mom. Now she pops up in the Star Wars Holiday special and Conan mentions her.
I forgot how hilarious Conan is
Woohoo Conan😂❤ God love you ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Absolute Number One! Connan is the best!
"What's wrong with you people?!" makes me laugh every time
Best episode ever :D
The final 15 minutes are like an Aunty Donna sketch.
F-ING  HILARIOUS
Outstanding!!!
This guy is absolute trooper, dedicated to the show even close to his own destruction. He should be next Terminator for sure
He is the ultimate host ! Undefeated!
amazing human being.. Love you Conan!
conan is a nice guy lol
The crazy thing on how popular this video is (I believe it is the most viewed Hot Ones) is that Conan didn't even know what the show was, until a kid approached him and said "you should go on Hot Ones."  He literally responded "what is Hot Ones?" but he did it anyways.
The best interviewer (in terms of questions and background check) in the most ridiculous setting.
Wow! Bravo!
So fiery 💕🔥🤪
For rhe next 12 hours after this was filmed, there is a toilet that hates Conan with a deep passion
This is hands down the most entertaining episode of hot ones EVER.
I’m not at all ever impressed these days, but I gotta tell u, that was very impressive 🎉🎉🎉🎉 hats off to u Conan u are a legend
this episode deservers an award. !!
2:13 "I don't fear your wings, man"   All of us assuming he's made a rookie mistake, not understanding how dead serious Conan was.
The best to ever do TV. What a legend..
Conan's self hatred is way more powerful than any spice 😂
THE TRUE CONAN THE BARBARIAN
Conan is a legend
Conan is an amazing actor, he went through the troubles, of pretending he felt these sauces, 😂
he is fooooooooking mad......love conan HAHAHAHA
my man my man my mannnnn
I want an extended cut so bad
Conan is the GOAT
Conan is KING❤
I wish Leslie Nielsen was still alive for this.
"Whats wrong with me ? Why can’t I feel ?!" You and me both Conan, you and me both
is this guy crazy
After Gordon Ramsay I always felt like Conan was the next no brainer guest for this show. Anyone who knows his style knew he would not only buy into the concept/format but he would take it up a notch. Conan said it best in the follow up recap on his podcast, "if I think something's funny, i will deal with the pain later." I'm glad this appearance introduced a new audience to his greatness because after leaving his TBS show, he didn't make many appearances outside of his podcast.
I used to think Conan was just clever.
- Where did you go to Med School? - In 1998 (Dr. Arroyo)
That's literally the hardest I have laughed in a very long time.
Hello Conan my dream is to wrestle Jon Moxley that is my dream to wrestle Jon Moxley. Love you Conan. Love you love you: Conan 💗💗💗💜😇🏴‍☠
I wish I could be like Conan, hopefully my kids can.
16:45 How I imagine he approaches everything.
Conan the Barsetting Barbarian.. Drank the 125k Scoville while taunting haha, and THEN did it to the last 3 too lol. How do you even breath with a mouth full of that.
Uhhhh...okayyy.
Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers, John Oliver, James Corden... All of them were on the Hot Ones...  Please bring Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart!
I seen Neil Armstrong land on the moon....this beats it.
I❤CONAN sooooooooooooo much 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is one of the most legendary Hot Ones episodes ever.
"not in a billion years" while being a former Simpsons and SNL writer is wild work. 😂❤ Coco has always been my fav for a reason! ❤🎉
Get tom hanks please
Unless you have tried the wings of death, there is no way to explain how much pain he put himself through for us. Thank you, legend!!!!
All the spice is absorbed by his hair, which is how he's able to do this. But even at his most unhinged, he's still smart enough to not touch his eyes, or he might've really needed that doctor!  Also, during his plug he turned into Master Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force 😆
How absolutely genius silliness like this is
hollywood are meritless talentless boomer hacks. they named hbo after their favorite boomer fone. he's right you will definitely lose braincells being exposed to anything coming out of that cesspool
My favorite episode yet.
I worshiped the great Chris Farley - but I think even he would have struggled to top this for hilarious manic energy
Funny thing, it's back to HBO Max 😂
I commented on this a year ago, but have to say, congrats to Sean and the Hot Ones team for being part of the Mark Twain comedy award show for Conan.   That has to be the most insane and meaningful compliment of all time. Never in a million years did Sean expect to be on that stage with Steven Colbert. This show is legendary
'The Shining 2' starring Conan O'Brien
I love Conan, but this was a little much .
It goes to show you how hard Conan can work, under pressure and still be a comedic genius devoted to perfecting the moment and getting all he can out of his opportunity to shine ✨
He crapped fire for 3 days straight guaranteed 😂 He is one of the funniest men alive IMHO.
It's going back to HBO Max soon
Ive loved Conan since 1995, and this was perfect.
Is everyone forgetting how many of the best episodes of The Simpsons he wrote? Yes that same Conan O’Brien
Conan is the greatest of all time!!!
This is a more subduded Robin Williams reincarnated through Conan
Unquestionably the greatest episode of Hot Ones.
This is like the BEST
This is like the BEST
Why does he want to sit double distance from you? Only last year right?
The hotter the wing the redder the Conan face 😅
Love conan
WING DROP!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH CONAN IS THE MAN lol
I’ve watched this for like 10 times already.
HBO MAX
Was sooo happy to see Sean at Conan’s Mark Twain Prize ceremony. It was only fitting.
One of the best Conan appearances ever he is the best
Sounds like Conan reached out to Warner Bros and got them to change Max back to HBO Max again. Just goes to show how much pull the Mark Twain prize can get you.
Exactly 13 months and a couple days after Conan bashes the name change on Hot Ones, they cave and change it back. Coincidence!?
25:00 THE HBO NAME HAS RETURNED
24:59 And now it's back to HBO Max
Wow. Best episode ever. I might just get Max for this guy. He’s the best.
3:13 I wanna see Conan’s reaction to WBD giving up and now rebranding Max back to HBO Max.
The Wings of Death took on the Conan Gauntlet… and they had to tap out. Wings = 0, Conan = 1
This really needs to be the most viewed video on the First We Feast channel. This man is a time-tested, insightful, risk taking veteran of comedy. One of the Greats. One of the most entertaining interviews of the 21st century.
I weep for both of their bumholes. I've never gasped more times during an episode
How did he do it? How. I really want him to wipe the sauce off his face.
Why couldnt conan do hot ones without sooo much extra B.S.
For real insane tho lol. Only late night show guy I find funny. Everything else is dumbed down these days.
2:00 compared to 24:30
Can’t believe Conan ended up being a total loser and bully enabler. Didn’t expect a hero to be the devil
still hasn't been an episode as good since,or before...and I doubt anyone will ever top it,except maybe Conan does a part 2 with Sona and Gourley.
I loveeee conannnnnn
Glad this was the last episode of the season as following this would be like following Freddie at LiveAid.
Clinically Insane😂
Best episode of all times!!!
He won.
His hair reminds me of Johnny Bravo
"What's wrong with me, why can't I feel." ...me too Conan, me too.
The vein popping in the lower, right side of Conan’s eye socket 😅
"These aren't the rantings of someone who's had some bad chemicals". Good God.. that killed me.
Real man the body rub with the Sauce . Lol talk about feeling the burn 🔥
royo rocks does dry bumbler perfectly brilliant conan move
Ohhhyyyaarrgghhh!!
First time I didn't hear "careful around the eyes" as he slathers himself in hot sauce
Conan should play the Joker. he would fit it well
This guy is a legend doing Da Bomb like that!!
Conan eats like a barbarian
Just sayed, that David Blane was the best, but i missed that one, Ok that one>DB>Steve O are my top 3, you are truly an incredible host just for creating that show man, thank you! <3
This is pure gold.
Conan is a god. A batshit crazy one, but a god nonetheless…
Hands down, favourite episode. I was dying near the end 😭
Esta es definitivamente la mejor entrevista en la historia de hot ones!
Best Hot Ones episode ever !
Who's here after watching his Mark Twain award show on Netflix?
Milk doesn’t work. You need bread. Bread soaks up the oils. Especially for Da Bomb and hotter.
Conan just knows how to bring people together
Amazing. Real entertainment.
Conan O’Brien is old school and one of the last few good actual comedians left. You can tell he was one of the writers for all those pre Y2K The Simpsons episodes by just looking at the way he is.
Seing Sean on the Mark Twain show made me happy espec after sitting up there with Conan.
He said "in showbiz, you're having the best show of all time", and then proceeded to demonstrate.
I'm not sure this doctor knows what he's doing.
23:00 says it all. GG Conan
You can see the pain in his eyes and his commitment to the bit is mad impressive.
Conan agreed to do the show but with one condition: the wings couldn’t be hot. He argued that the show had been running for a long time and needed something fresh and unexpected, something they hadn’t done before. While everyone else cries from the heat, he stays completely unfazed. There’s no way this would actually happen, but as a concept, it makes for great content. Any producer would understand the logic. And to be clear, this is just my take, not a statement of fact
Best one I've ever seen 😂😂😂
Funniest guy that ever lived
Who’s here after mark Twain award?
ONE OF THE BEST EPISODES YET!!!😅😅😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 CONAN YOU ARE PROFESSIONAL AND SO IS SEAN!🎉🎉🎉
Who's here after his mark twain prize acceptance?🎉
HOLY effing sh*t this was the best mix between intentionality/comedy and sincerity. New respect for Conan.  Love the outtakes! SO good!
How many dice of inspiration does he get?
A perfect Silhouette A Beautiful Story And unforgettable. Hot ones Is Forever In the Universe. This is the Way
I’m gonna throw up
the doc said "it's there" LOLOLOL
Conan O'Brien is the GOAT.
I never thought I'd be scared of Conan, but I'm scared of Conan.
The most chaotic guest ever
"Are we doing this not?"
What a performer
The stetoscope on the toungue lol
Finish guy todo this?  Unbelievable
Conan what a man! greatest representation male gender i salute you!
Conan is a legend❤
Conan is awesome and funny and I always love watching his shows.
Legend
Jeasus
Rich and yet remained down to earth. Cheers
Conan  The only night host not to get political. Cherished soul
I miss COCO on Late Night.  "In the year 3,000....."  So funny!  I definitely need to check out the show on Max.  Even though this is a year after this first aired.  Better late than never, right?!
The GOAT….Conan
Conan is absolutely hilarious! I laugh so hard when he talks! When  of the funniest men on this planet! No, universe!
I LOVE CONAN O'BRIEN!!!
Conan is the GOAT
Only Hot Ones I've watched more than twice
This episode is a year old already!?!!?!?
I love Conan so much  Grew up watching the man and so nice seeing him continue to show the world how funny and genuine he is
great interviewer great interviewee, great drawing demonstration, bad choice of music.
So funny!!  You need to have Oprah
Out of the undoubtly thousands of hours I have spent watching videos online this has got to be one of the most entertaining and existential awakening watching experiences I have ever encountered.
This looks like the origin story of the joker
One of the best episodes yet! Thanks
Conan ages but the hair never does and stays the same.
Hands down by far the best episode of hot onees ever
We need Werner Herzog on Hot Ones!
Simply the best episode ever.
haha best one yet
Only Conan can say a quote that includes Gandi and Popeye together 😂😂😂
I don't fear your wings, man.
He went to Harvard on the Towny Scholarship.  Harvard started a scholarship program with the locals to help appease the animosity in the city. Anyone who applies is accepted.  HE refuses to talk about that too. That guy failed  on the Tonight Show and walked with 34 million and played the victim.  The Simpsons cast hates him IMPOSTER
Sean. Can you show us all the provocative and interesting questions you wanted to ask Conan that he wouldn't answer? BECAUSE HE IS A HACK WITH NO PERSONALITY. HE WOULD HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF AS HAVING IMPOSTER SYNDROME. FACTS
Nobody makes me laugh as hard as Conan 😂 "Max, it doesn't sound as good"
What’s with the MUSIC in the background!! It’s too loud!! It’s too fast and way over dramatic! Please! I love Conan so much and this music takes attention away from him!😢😢😢😢
What’s with the MUSIC in the background!! It’s too loud!! It’s too fast and way over dramatic! Please! I love Conan so much and this music takes attention away from him!😢😢😢😢
Like you know this is the best Hot Ones right?
Gosh I love Conan I miss tuning into his show but his podcast is amazing still
Conan OWNS this show. He put every other guest to shame. Mind you , I think he may have near to died from over exposure to chilli. Good thing that he had his own doctor standing by.
this is my 3rd liked video of all time, go first we feast !!!!!
Why is he putting them in his pocket? crazy
“I’m not gonna lie I’m feeling this one”
Conan’s final speech tops Chaplin’s speech in the Great Dictator. Goosebumps
You're looking at a man who  dealt with Series of Dangerous animals for decades you think  thesr would ngs scsre him lol 😂
Conan is crazy dude! 🤣
How come Conan hasn’t been to India?
18:43 PERIODT!
16:50 YASSSSSSSS🎉🎉🎉🎉!!!!
Conan is right about growing up in an Irish (and Czech) home. You're only spice is potato. And the air around it. It certainly wasn't the love of your mother's heart made of ice.
Frank Booth is scared.
“You said this is pure pepper?” LOL
Best guest ever 😮
How can you not love Conan😜
The best late night host of all time. Hands down. But you know what I love most about him? You see the other hosts and they always have to come off like the coolest guys in the room. But Conan, does not care about that. The guy will make the jokes, be the jokes, and isnt at all afraid of how he looks or what people think.
This was max comedy 😂
That was insane!
Hahahahahhahaaaaa 👌
Funniest episode ever!
It was huge missed opportunity to not mention Conan on Murderville eating all that hot sauce! Lol JK I looooooove this. Best hot ones ever.
That’s how you Da Bomb, Conan! Only a red-headed legend can!
what an absolutely insane episode! I really think that on the last question about comedy Conan was doing a tribute to Charlie Chaplin speech, which was perfect in so many ways, but Conan using the impression as baseline for his answer is pure genius.  24:02 @FirstWeFeast am I overthinking?
I've never seen a mouth turn into the other hole on the other end (think rear). 🤣 I did not eat these insane wings, yet I can feel it watching Conan. I bet he threw up after this.
Best  ever !,,🎉😂🎉😂🎉
WORST
Why are his sauces unopened?
Imagine watching ice spice after this masterpiece
coming into this after watching Will Forte's episode is great
Did Conan  eat one of those blue watermelons that make everything taste the opposite? Cause I have watched every single episode of hot ones and that man is a BEAST!!!!  My only regret is that he didn’t do the hip pull frog leg dance LOL.  Bill Murray is somewhere A proud Godfather of comedy!
The stethoscope on the tongue.
Conan is the final BOSS
Happy birthday, Connan!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Still the best one ever!
That's the wildest "First we feast" Ever! canon, you take the cake!
From 24:10 he should have been committed...
From 24:10 he completely lost it
Happy birthday Conan
Why does he put the nibbled off chicken wings in his Pocket...
Happy birthday Coco 😃
Golden
Conans always weird but this cracked me up.
I don’t know if there is a HOF for eating wings, but this guy has to be the 🐐
I went to the first we feast page and sorted by popularity expecting this to be the #1 viewed episode, I can't believe that its not!!
@Taskmaster Please get Conan on your show 🙏
Love Conan.
I've never seen Conan so unhinged, this is by far my fave Hot Ones
It gonna hurt comin' out, though.
I can remember that Finland special and the reindeer. Mostly because of the guy who looked like Charles Bronson.
Was Conan on Coke?
Frankly I don't use the word hero very often, but Conan O'Brian is the Greatest Hero in American history.
The best guest I ever seen on hot ones. Conan is incredible.
22:47 you can literally see Conan's soul begin to ascend from his body xD
conan understood the assignment
Why do I feel like Conan paid dividends for this escapade
I don't fear your wings mane
22:52 you can see the fear in Sean's eyes
3:08 😂😂😂😂
Conan, the palest ghost from Brookline, was able to handle the hot wings like a champ. This was the most surprising of episodes.
Watching this again
22:28 when you realise you might be a sociopath
18:39 joker??
I forgot that Conan is able to go "Tom Green" once in a while.
This is by far the best episode ever
I'm waiting for Conan to rub his fingers in his eyes.
Conan’s contour is on point
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!!!!! Conan is out of his ever loving mind! And I love it
This was terrible
okay i really like o'brien cause of this
Jay could never.
Sean was the guest ☠️
Legend ❤
That was unbelievable !
This is the funniest episode I’ve ever seen!! 😂😂😂
This is head & shoulders the best hot ones
How?!!!?!  Just.. HOWWWW?!!!??!!?
14:01
I can not imagine what was happened next morning.
"I was never that excited about volume" really Conan, with that hair?
!!
So they were props
Comer O’Brien need to show some respect and some Manners he is the worst  For a guest, For a co host show yeah I respect that  except he didn’t show any respect for the Hot ones  He didn’t even show any good manners that just grossed me out Dude I dare you if you don’t like what I’m saying I’m challenging you to a pro wrestling no holds barred match
This is the best episode of hot ones - and I love many of them.
He had excess sauce all over his lips the whole time. How is that not burning?
Here for a rewatch after the Will Forte episode
Conan has me in tears right now
Conan look like the type of taking a sip of water and  said this is SPICY!!! Surprise he did good lol
Chris Farley would’ve been on this level
Does the host insure his colon?😂
Conan sure does know how to preform. One of the better interviews
That was awesome!  😂
#1 episode of all time...conan is a force of nature
By far one of, if not, the best episode of this I've seen!!!
Conan rules❤
The moment the camera cuts back to Conan and he his covered in drool saying he is fine broke me
😂😂😂😂😂
Y’all ever see the video off guy dying on stage and just laying there because people thought he was joking….. that’s gonna be Conan
Exactly one year ago we were blessed with this beauty.
Not a Conan fan. Just became a Conan fan. Awesome episode
Hope you’re doing well, Jason
Oh, Conan, you are a gem
Why isnt there a new comment every day about this insanity !!
I never have been more afraid, for someone's guts 😔 RIP.
10:10 That was such an on-point Andy
I can never see him the same way again.
Honestly Conan did the most Sean musta have the most fun in his life filming this out of every other guest he’s ever had
How has Conan never been the Joker in any Batman media?
“My guess is he liked the battered chicken”-Conan O'Brien to Deon Cole at a restaurant where Ike and Tina Turner visited 💀
As a redhead who CAN confirm: tolerant to way too much spice. As an autistic: sensitive to too much stimulation. Result: Brain confusion.
Whoever chooses thumbnails picked a winner for this one. The expression, the loose tie.... staring directly at the camera. Always has an air of vaudeville when I see it.
Conan is the freaking GOAT
What a legend
now I am back here to compare him with murray lol. both champ for me
I stopped watching this show after this episode....as, despite my disdain for O'brien's mediocre, at best, talent....he blows this whole show out of the water here, no-one can ever top this performance....it reached its pinnacle...and now ever new episode is just another attempt to equal what O'Brien did here.  Kudos for that, however, the red hair and the arrogance towards Gene Wilder on his show, not so much....
"Never saw a spice until I was 50"💀
Conan ✌️ a beast a total beast.
I occasionally visit the hot ones and miss many interviews, and this is the first I've seen someone pocket the Wings in their clothes
Legend!!
The way he ramps up to compensate for the heat is pretty great
Why is piano playing in the background
Conan is not only the goat of late night shows, he is the goat of the whole entertainment industry.
Redheads are spawned from active volcanoes. Hot sauce has no effect on them. Now ice cream on the other hand…
This is why I was always a fan of Conan O'Brien.
This is the best episode by far lol.
Has there ever been a moment in time where a mic drop was more appropriate? This feels like the perfect episode, you get serious answers whilst also delivering an epic performance.
ZzZzzZzZzzzzzzzzzzzz
7:29
Conan is nothing less of a legend for the entertainment industry.
Conan and Chris Farley have to be related.
... pulse check... 🫀😂
This was amazing
No one loves Conan O’Brien as much as Conan O’Brien.
Conan conquered this episode. We're just too nice to acknowledge it. As much as I've been with Hot Ones since the very beginning, I started at the beginning of Conan too. It's a defeat you should be proud of. Good stuff.
im English and tend to be sniffy about US comedians.  The last ten minutes of this has made me cry with laughter at least 20 times!!!!  CALL THE WIFE!!!
He got that jacket from Bill Burr.
Dude, I’m crying. Love you Conan
Conan got a lobotomy before this
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!!!!
❤Amazing 🤣 thank you for that!
Easily a top 3 episode!! Thank you Conan, you’re a F’n legend
Freaking awesome! Can't believe i waited so long to watch this one! I was rolling! 😂😂😂
This is easily the most entertaining episode I’ve seen. Conan is imba.
This man ….yoh! Nuf said
Conan O'Brien should move to Haiti since it's pure paradise according to him.
I was in tears of laughter the whole way through ❤
This has been my favorite episode overall!!
i have commented this on other first we feast videos....but it is overruled...THIS is the best episode EVER.....lol
Ohh it's building
Have you ever noticed he doesn’t drink anything?
Conan gives his all always, i love him.
WHAT a LEGEND!!!!
This is the greatest EVER performance on Hot Ones. Conan we salute you Sir 🥊👍❤️
Are we doing this or not!!!!!,?
Epic! The consummate professional!
rewatching this again because it was just so funny !whose with me?!
the best episode! hahaha
Aries are always super daring....😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
the absolute BEST!! from both amazing hosts
Jim Carry time next!
Did Conan just have a mental breakdown on Hot Ones? 🔥😂
Hands-down, the best hot ones ever!
Dab of the Decade well deserved!
Congratulations Conan on the "Dab Of The Decade!!!!"
We need Dr Aroyo at hot takes
Best show ever!
Him and Steve O will be pure comedy
Talk about committing to the bit
😂😂😂😂😂
I don't remember watching this and there's no like on the video from me. Guess I must have missed it somehow. Probably intended to watch it and then just got distracted.  Considering the time, it makes sense. This was around my first vacation in like a *decade.* I was pretty distracted.
Conan O'Brien - what a freak...
Conan completely deserved Dab of the Decade, this man has me giggling while on the toilet seat
Dab of the decade!
'CALL THE WIFE!'
“What’s wrong with me, why can’t I feel?”
Congrats on winning Dab of the Decade. Well deserved.
Love it ❤
G.O.A.T.
I wish I could 'like' this every time I watch it.
It's impossible, this episode cannot be topped.
Masterfully done.
His childish enthusiasm is what makes him timeless.
20:11 that's hilarious. Like dying from convenience store sushi.
18:59 his entire career. His commitment can never be questioned. Conan is a real one.
Conan sticking chicken bones in his pocket is objectively hilarious
I’m here late, but Conan is this indescribably force that just imprints in whatever he does
Conan is an international tresure.
The music they cut to this is so jarring 😂 I feel like I’m in an ad for some kind of medication.
Conan can still entertain us!
How did he literally become Jim Carrey
The best and most chaotic 27 minutes of hot ones ever 😂.
CONAN is the best guest ever.
CM PUNK
Pure Genius.
Favorite one by far!!!
I love your enthusiasm for Hot Ones and First We Feast! It's great to see people passionate about shows that bring people together and celebrate differences. Conan O'Brien is indeed hilarious and a brilliant conversationalist. His ability to connect with guests from diverse backgrounds is impressive. Your philosophical take on appreciating differences and living life to the fullest resonates deeply. Embracing diversity and being open to new experiences are essential for personal growth and a richer understanding of the world. Keep enjoying Hot Ones, and who knows? Maybe someday Ill get to share wings with Conan and the gang!
Finland mention, torille!
Conan is literally a Comic character who got lost in a real world
Never thought I could like him more
fake
conan, we liked you as soon as you brought on steve irwin. you did NOT have to do this 😓
Why the jurassic park music
🐐
Hes a complete savage
Conan has the ability to channel just a little bit of Randy Quaid to over emphasize the madness.  Brilliant.
Somewhere, a toilet just whispered… ‘Oh God, no.’ 🔥
Conan reached some Danny Kay kinda Manic Zen.
I've watched this like 60 or 70 times.
This is genius inspiration incarnate! Conan on hot sauce has a straight pipeline to the divine 😂
That was the most unhinged hot ones EVER and I am LIVING FOR ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
The absolute best episode ever, love Conan.
Now we've got Jimmy no personality with a beard and Jimmy no personality without a beard as late night hosts
"Its just STARTING to peak through" 😂
2 min in I’m already dying from laughter
He’s like an out of control toddler spilling all the sauces😂😂😂😂😂😂
This man is tv gold 😂
Sean basically had the day off this episode 😂
Conan’s has such a commanding presence 😂
Conan is a Barbarian!
Connan is so hilarious ❤❤❤❤
Who else knows that Dr Arroyo is a returning character with Conan
Here from Mila Kunis Hot ones
One of the funniest guests ever! 🤣🤣🤣  imScott 🤓🤓
His drive to be a performer trumps his pain receptors. 😂
*checks for pulse bpm* “it’s there.”
So funny Conan i love it 😅😅😅
You are the man😂😂😂
Love it 😂❤ Badass
Conan is just laugh out loud funny nonstop
Conan is the GOAT
"I'm starting to feel some sensation"  aka  "I'm dying"
Shawn he's got it all over his face right on Conan O'Brien 🤣
This was the BEST one ever!!!
14:06 mother of pearl.
Last Dab is only 64,000 Scoville. Not a good idea to give people a false confidence on how much heat they can take.
It looks like spice tolerance is a thing. What if every person interviewed had each question asked with a gap?
Conan gave some good and sincere answers for Shaun, and made him look good. That’s why Conan is the king.
Best ever!!!! ❤
22:38😂😂
da real mvp of season 23
This was comedy gold. Conan is a Wing Warrior
The Conan Podcast jokes about what came out the other end still haven't been exhausted.
This video should have 10x the views it does. It's a tragedy.
What a legend
Okay best hot ones yet
I watch this every couple of months. Sometimes i need to laugh uncontrollably
I would love to see David Lee Roth on this show. That would be VERY entertaining.
I love Conan, went to Universal Studios and they had a wax figure of him at his studio desk and we got a photo together. 😂 It is all I remember and he was made of wax.
Sometimes I just put this in the background to feel better about the day
Easily the funniest episode ever
What a great interview. I think both of you truly enjoyed and got something substantial from each other.
That’s one way to get thru it…hard drugs prior to recording!
most late night host were prim proper an by the book, Conan showed that its okay to be goofy and not be the norm. Hes an icon
14:40 Image not available?
The best hot ones ever. This is the second time I'm watching this episode.
Best episode!!!!
Almost as tough as DJ Khaled.
21:06 going so hard that he was channeling Gilbert Gottfried
Whenever I need a motivation and a good laugh, I will come here to watch this. Thank you, Conan.
Conan devouring the scenery like it's a KFC 8 piece.
One of the best episodes yet! Conan had me rolling! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Real life Ace Ventura😂
Conan is an Icon.
😂😂😂 Conan is hilarious!
WOW CONAN MAN!!!!!!! HE'S GREAT!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
17:00 wise words for life
Best guest by far... Conan The GOAT
This is a 10/10 episode. Conan is a national treasure
Most annoying guest yet
where did you go to schoole? in 1998 🤣🤣🤣
Possibly the greatest hot ones episode ever
Legendary.
What a fricken legend!
“What’s wrong with me, why can’t I feel anything?”  I’m crying 😂🤣
"CALL THE WIFE!" 🤣🤣🤣
Never saw spice till I was 52.  Indeed we are the meat, potatoes and peas generation. With a little rice or bread pudding thrown in.
Still makes me laugh.
People here talk about Conan like he is dead. I mean. Everyone agrees he is a living legend. Interesting. I can't say i see the appeal but it's interesting to see so many people agree about someone in such a positive way.
REPTILIANS CONFIRMED SPICY FOOD NOTED 📖😅
Probably the best show to date Conan is Hilarious
Conan is next level man...
Conan is an animal 😂
he is dead inside
Conan needs to be back ! One of the best episodes !
Absolutely incredible
Goat
Love this guy 😂
Love this guy 😂
Whoever ends up doing the season finale for next season's really gonna have to up their game if they want to compete with the likes of Conan O'brien. That, was insane! I wouldn't expect any less from him he's always been a legend and legendarily funny.
Well...that was --beautiful? That was amazing😂
I don't know why I didn't expect this to be the absolute wildest guest in the show's history, but shame on me because Conan is and always will be the reigning King of entertainment
Comedians are some of the best guests
13:50 22:24 23:00
Poor the bomb, cant handle a little conan.
Doctor Arroyo dropped the ball!!!  When he Checked out Chris, and "It's not good,* the line should have been *You've got four months max.*
This is just superhuman. Absolute legend.
Conan is a beast
Conan had me howling😂😂😂
That is though a hardest step ever laughed at any one of these episodes😅😅😅
Oh my word 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This bit bring his Oscar hosting
I love Conan hahahaha
I love Conan
23:00 This might be the first time I've heard someone say "I'm fine" while they turn red, tear up, and drool, and I'm sort of inclined to believe them, lol. Which is even better after hearing him talk about it afterward.
That was hilarious.
Why is he keeping the wings an in his pocket ??? Lol😂😂😂
This is the most EPIC thing I have ever seen! I don't know how anyone will ever top Conan!
There will never be a better hot ones episode.
18:37;  he's sweating profusely!  Lol
He’s comedy gold. His parents are proud of what he is as a human being
20:06 mediocre is a compliment to warren j harding😂
Conan's become too powerful, we can no longer contain him!  "Doctor" Arroyo was my favorite piece.  It was so nice of Conan to invite a small-time creator onto his show like this.
This my 3rd time watching this
it is the Absolut  best piece  of  program  during  all  the yeahrs
I like Jay, Kimmel and Fallon. Conan is the best.
Bring Jordan Schlansky please.
Best episode ever
By far the funniest hot ones ever.
conan is the best thing this world has seen on comedic timing and approach ,nothing is better than this episode
17:20 That's the effect Conan has on people. He felt it. We - the audience feel it everytime we look at a Conan video.
Best episode ever !
Conan gave 1000%! A legend was born on hot one's!
23:50 … good stuff
13:58 My question to you…
13:58
Absolute legend ❤☘️🇮🇪
I really hope it doesn't become the norm for guests to come on and do planned bits or go out of their way to try to be entertaining. The doctor thing was funny, but I personally watch this show to get to see actors take off their 'performer' hat and just talk about topics that interest them, have authentic banter and genuine reactions to the spice. The structure of the show allows that to unfold pretty organically- if the guest is willing to participate. I get that Conan's a comedian so he was trying to deliver, but plenty of other comedians have been on the show and been perfectly entertaining by just being themselves and letting the interview become a collaborative effort- not a one man show
Conan is the best of all time after Carson.
😂😂😂 im friggin dying 😂😂😂 the man's a beast 😂❤❤❤ truly a classic episode hands down, this man raise the bar so high it will be a while before anyone catches up 😂😂😂❤❤❤    💥💥💥🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹💥💥💯👍 For you Conan 👍💯💥😊
i repeat...2025.....conon the king of hot wings..needs a statue
Conan O'Brien is the greatest Hot Ones guest of all time.
The 💯 Irishman soars to the top of Hot Ones Legends.  Did not have that on my bingo card.
And he hosted the Oscar's
“if there was a mic drop i do one, But i do a wing drop!”  My favorite ending line of this show
I love Coco. Hes the best late night host ever.
@21:22 No questions afterwards? Just straight to the next bottle? LOL There has to exist some outtakes.....
Conan is hilarious.
Protect Conan at all costs!
Conan Barbarian 😂
Legend
Jay hurt him more than I thought. He has no feelings! 😂😂😂😂😂
I love Conan
How could i not love this gentleman.
Anyone who's ever done a Hot Ones night at home knows how absolutely brutal it is, and how much more impressive that makes this interview. I wouldn't wish Da Bomb on my worst enemy, and Conan just absolutely tanks through it without missing a comedic beat. God tier
Back again to watch this GEM of an episode
Crazy
ABSOLUTE LEGEND
Conan, your episode has no equal. I was in awe. Never has there been a more impressive display of hot sauce consumption. Hail to the king
Still the best episode almost a year later 🎉
Conan and thundercat are the two BEST hot ones guests ever. I stand on it
best episode ever
Canceling my therapy session because Conan cured my depression
Watching a second time! Best episode ever! 😂🤭
Show Business is...
OMFG!!!!  I’m CRYING REAL TEARS!!  Utter perfection.  Every aspect of this was utterly perfect.
This guy? IS THE BEST!!!!
one of a kind
Conan the destroyer of 🔥 Hot 0nes
23:30 fuckimg unbelieveable, wise worlds masked in comedy delievered by a savant. salute to you good sir
poor conan, born in a white ppl house w no seasoning ))):
Warren G Hardey! WARREN G!
Look at this legend run this show. Im in awe
from the second Conan put that first wing in his pocket I knew that he wasnt locked up in there with Sean, Sean was locked up in there with him
Hilarious!
That's a real mam, right there.
There’s absolutely no topping this episode.
Everytime he put a wing in his pocket I laughed just as hard as the first time he did it 😂
He just jumped on that hot sauce buffalo and gave it a good kick and went along for the ride, didn't he?
It’s fake .. during the bomb he switches from water to milk in the same scene Welcome people to the power of television
The bills need to be paid…
I feel sad for him. Conan is like some of our great comedians that hurt themselves for a laugh and people's approval... it was hard to watch
Best episode of Hot ones 😂❤
Legendary
I genuinely don't remember the last time I laughed this hard this consistently. Oh, God, my abs actually hurt. That's probably because I'm terribly out of shape and nothing to do with the humor, but I have to have a scapegoat, so there it is.
Conan is world's most entertaining Host hands down.
I loved Mad!
Conan, you are starting to resemble John Wayne.  Maybe you should make a western.
the GOAT
How did I not know that we shared the same birthday 🎉😂
im so turned on rn
Almost a year and this is still my single favorite Hot Ones.
I buy the first one and I think it's got some heat 😂
By far the best interview. 😂
Absolute mad man, lol. Bro went harder than any other guest on them sauces. Incredible.
Conan hustled us with that growing up without spice bit
😂😂😂❤❤ Om
4:03 cue in the music
Epic and entertaining! I was amazed and in tears laughing.
Chugging that bottle 💀
Best episode of Hot one's 😂
O my god did he go to hospital after that?
New even higher respect for Conan.  Maybe the best episode yet
This is, hands-down, the best Hot Ones episode ever! I laughed until I cried. Legendary!
Bro looks like a disgruntled FBI agent who uses unorthodox methods to solve the case.
I did NOT expect the steadfast-ness. Legend.
Here after Conan absolutely killed it at the Oscars. What a magnetic personality.
I’m still here
That was one of the most incredible things I have ever seen.
Unreal. A true legend. Who knew?
AMAZING••😎😎😎
He’s a ghostbuster…”it’s all right Don’t worry. We can handle it! They wanna play rough? Let’s play rough!”
9:30 🤣🤣🤣
I love conan and this is awesome but it is also by the book every canadian comic since birth so while i love it it its not new to me
11:41
The Richard Nixon impersonation had me in STITCHES 💀😂
This is by FAR my favorite Hot Ones episode
23:30 - Conan About Reading
This was so entertaining! Hilarious! 🤣
He's not wrong. I can't call it max either
Mila Kunis, thank you so much for going to your next door neighbor's house and harassing him until he came on the show.
Wow! This had to be the spiciest episode yet!!  ❤️ it!!!
Best of all!
This is intense
Best episode ever!!!😂🍗🔥
This man is my favourite person in the world.
Conan has to be #1 on the Hot Ones Hall of Fame
Why does Conan look so good?
this whole interview had me rolling but hearing Sean say "wise words from a wise and stable man" while Conan drools like a rabid animal SENT ME
2:20
A Norm level brilliant comedian
It's been awhile since i had a good laugh. This reminded me why i love conan so much
This can't be beaten
I'm sure Conan had to bathe in milk after this
22:25  Big mistake
8:05 “What do you think is the most annoying thing or trait a guest can do when appearing on a talk show?”  “The host can do a lot of things but when they look out at an audience and say it’s not going well. You see 200 souls leave 200 bodies.”  I think Conan got a little confused here. Was he talking about the guest or the host?
Conan is so great. Just full throttle
Conan is the best
If you want ENTERTAINMENT contact Conan O'Brien
Pocketing the wings is peak Alpha behavior.  Edit: I stand corrected. Having your primary care physician pocket your wings is peak Alpha behavior.
This is a complete fever dream
Conan is TV & Sean is Internet
After doing the Nixon voice for 30 seconds and then saying, “The voice alone I’d have to say, probably, Lincoln.” Was an underrated line.
That was by far the best episode I've ever watched. I cried laughing. Conan is a comedy gem
20:40 Chris Farley lives!
I am watching this for the 10th time. Ya’ll with me??
That ending was like the speech in the great dictator
He is the image of someone never giving up. The show must go on! Watched this at the edge of my seat.
Jesus christ i hope he was ok after this intreview bc drinking the hot sauce was INSANE 😫😂
Came back after watching Conan at the Oscars — what an unbelievable episode hahaha
i used to watch late night with conan muted with subtitles after bedtime in middle school. i got caught a few times but it was totally worth it. dude will always be relevant simply because he gives it his all to be entertaining
Seen a 15 second snippet of Conan licking the wings. Made my way to see the whole episode. Start it up, and the first 60 seconds of Conan sitting so politely had me rolling already.
He’s amazing
what does conan say under his breath at 7:55? Can someone tell me?
His face color can‘t lie 😂
the head writer knows that if conan is there, it's not a comedy vacuum
The best
This is the effect of being named "Conan". The sauce awakened the warrior within! 😂
Conan for president.
Pedro Pascal soon plsss
He is absolutely insane 🤣🤣🤣
He's awesome
Conan is a messy Aries and we LIVING for him❤
Subscibe just becausr of this episode...
Absolute GOAT. First episode I've openly laughed, but they're all great . Conan is just another level!
The mental alacrity of Conan is unbelievable. And to the AMAZING interviewer also!!!
18:20 😂😂😂😂😂😂
3rd time I see this, first time I noticed the sauces flowing out of the bottles profusely like they're bleeding.
I’m so glad to see him making a comeback right now. I just read he’s hosting this year’s Oscars and it makes me truly happy. If you ever hear other people talk about him as a boss, a friend, and just person, I can’t think of anyone in the host business that is more genuine, caring, intelligent and kind.  Was very sad when TBS took your show, and I hope that this years Oscar’s propels you back into my living room on a daily basis.
22:54 dude the look of fear in Sean's eyes. It's like he's watching Conan slowly transform into a monster
Worst show ever 😢
Seriously he isn't even funny if he was the first of this show i never would have watched it again god don't have him on again just awful
Conan is BY FAR the best contender that might be better, YES BETTER, than Johnny.  I said it.  But, it’s because it’s true.  Conan is genuine like Johnny, more funny, and endured more!  In my opinion, Conan is the king of Late Night, period.  Nobody else comes close to being more entertaining than Conan.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Conan is just a force of nature, the best 28 minutes of my life I have ever wasted.
Bro I love this guy!🤣🤣🤣
Who is here after the oscars
GOAT Episode
The only late night talk show host I like.
Conan is the man
COCO COCO COCO!!!
The best 💯❤️‍🔥
gross
The King of Hot Ones... Conan
SO DISGUSTING this man is  so disgsting, i cant believe he is married
that was good
Single greatest episode ever.
I didn’t like this interview the first time I watched it. I enjoyed it more the 2nd time for the same reasons I didn’t like it the first time.  You can see Conan’s insecurities live. He’s genuine but he can’t feel out of control.
🤣🤣 Conan kills me
Absolute Professional the best
Honestly, Shane saying this was a bad bit was worse then the other thing. Way worse.
:DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Conan O'Brian and Gordon Ramsey are like the same level of extra but on completely different ends of the hot wing spectrum LOL
Kudos not only to the golden human rooster of a man that is Conan O'Brien, but also to Sean himself for not only being at all moments a super professional interviewer, but knowing how to roll with Conan's humour and matching his energy
Obsessed, best guest. Not only because of his antics, but just a meaningful one to have the great Conan!!
He needs a doctor for supporting and voting democrat during biden alone. And for his all time voting democrat blind due to family brainwash; this is obvious ;he needs to be checked for 6 toes; webbed toes; and nephalim giant genes as a modern spy; reporting to the vatican reptilians for bags of gold. Yes something is not right with this guy.
Conan is a comedian but he made Khaled look like a clown. Love it
Absolutely incredible....🤣
This may be my favorite YouTube video. I’ve come back to rewatch this more times than I’d like to admit…
It's going to be one dark day when Conan goes. Let's enjoy it while it lasts.
Love you conan
that guy went through hard drugs for sure
This is what got him the Mark Twain Prize
I would watch Conan as a regular guest  His dedication too the humour is legendary. And the pocket chicken bit. Killed me
I’m so glad Sean got the kudos he deserved from a legend of an interviewer. Sean is probably the best interviewer I’ve ever seen. Him and his team do the best research and craft the most insightful questions. They always shock their guest with at least one question and it’s so impressive
Sean has never looked so scared 😂
Absurd that Sean "I always mirror the guest" Evans didn't also put the wings in his pocket
This was amazing! Conan seems like a down to earth dude
Conan progressively getting more insane and unhinged as he ate each wing, was absolutely magical 🎉 i loved this episode so much. I actually cried laughing 😂
2 of the best hosts in existence
Conan ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Next President ❤️🙂
One of the actual best! Used to write for the Simpsons then became one of the best hosts in tv history ❤ wish I saw him more with Craig Ferguson ❤️❤️
Conan we love you so much!
Da bomb is not that viscous, the bit was weak sauce
Best hot ones
What a lunatic
this is now my favorite episode. conan is a f*cking living legend!!!
This has to be the funniest Hot Ones interview.
Qa
Miss Conan late night. All went downhill after he left.
The burning ring of Fire in the AM 😂😂😂😂.
Conan is a Savage 😂😂😂. What did I just witness😂😂😂.
😂
Before Leo, there was Conan
If u know Conans history in the entertainment business then you know hes eaten sh*t so often in his career that eating  hot sauce is a step up.
And they say white people can't handle the spice, lol. Conan the Barbarian for real!!
Conan is one my all time comedy heroes
A CHAMP! THE BESTEST OF THE BESTEST! ...HIM & I CAN BE FRIENDS NOW! IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FRIEND LIKE HIM, YOU'RE NOT LIVING LIFE!
I love Conan
Straight up maniacal, he should be locked up and examined
I don’t think Dr. Arroyo is a real doctor.
This is easily the best one I've seen
Going back to the beginning, knowing that this is going to get completely insane, is such a surreal experience
What for a pure a Warrior!
Conan drinking the hot sauce was the greatest thing I’ve ever seen on this show.  By far the best any guest has ever performed
"Whats wrong with me?!? why can't I *FEEL!!!* " 22:22 😂😂😂
This whole show was my favorite moment.
This is genuinely one of the funniest videos I have ever seen in my life. Conan eating hot wings has potentially changed my outlook on life 😂
Epic interview!!!!
As soon as he said “water buffalo” I knew it was going all down hill. They’re incredibly dangerous & remember to target their victims. Crazy how they bring these animals on with no education on them.
conan is actually more brutal than the barbarian
wow...that....was disturbing.
Good God I love Conan :D the fact that the crew can't stop laughing and sean can't stop laughing is just a delight. <3
Conan is the kind of talent that we don't appreciate enough until he dies. We all as society should let him know he is fighting the greats for the best of all time.   While he is still alive, the man is very old and tired and hate when children go on his lawn
Conan is the best Hot Ones guest of all time! Not a Dull moment!!! He did fantastic with the wings and answered all questions and gave all interesting answers. Great questions also. Love Conan. VOTE CONAN FOR BEST GUEST EVER!
Conan is and always will be, the best!
HE didn't cheat it,like taking 1 bite, he ate ALL the wing, forget drinking the sauce, that was just insane.
😂
This is a host vs host episode and conan was not gonna go down easy
Still the best episode
17:31 he was about to drink from the Bomb 😂 then on second thought maybe not
Bravo Conan. Bravo! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
3rd time watching this
Fn Love Conan!!!!! ❤❤❤❤
Conan must be cold hearted to not get burned. Also I swear I heard  Jurassic Park music
I wish he was still on TBS
Conan looks like the character from an old 80’s Apple IIe game I used to play as a kid. Sammy Lightfoot!!!
I wish I could give this more than one like
Thia is the funniest episode. Because of this I watched "Conan Must Visit".
Conan is the best! ❤
Epic!
The doctor listening to sean’s tongue with the stethoscope 😂😂😂
@16.44 quite literally the most unhinged thing I’ve ever seen
😂 You can literally see the fear and apprehension in Sean's eyes as Conan is absolutely either unfazed or able to act like it without a hint of distress... Priceless 😄👌🌶️
How does the best episode have the least views
Conan is the best! Great entertainer, host, interviewer comedian! I enjoy all your projects and keep it going Conan! The world needs you!
Conan is the best 😂 salute 🫡
" There is funny in the Old testament and New testament, there is funny everywhere!"   Words to live by.
This episode got more viewers than Jay Lenos second run on the Tonight Show
No one will top this for entertainment value. Ever.
😍🤩🤩😘
Conan was channeling from another realm @ 26:30 a modern day prophet. And with that finish I just realized Conan is a Comedy god
Conan gain 1000x respect from me.
The best episode of Hot Ones ever, Conan is such a treasure.
milkman
Conan was before my time, but now I understand.
DUDE this had me rolling
Conan is a live action Master Shake from ATHF
Conan has a type of manic energy that can't be matched. The man understands the "show" in show business. Comic genius.
Conan crush it!😂
Love him!!!!
This is how I imagine things would go if Robin Williams lived to be interviewed on this show. Soooo brilliantly unhinged.
It’s funny because it would seem that Conan is a guy that “doesn’t take himself too seriously” since any time you see him you expect a laugh and then in this interview he’s making a bunch of jokey jokes,  but when comedy is his job, it’s refreshing to see the person outside of the job or art, without all the bells and whistles—but Conan does take himself a bit too seriously because he’s one of those characters that has to continuously keep the act going (even bringing the doctor guy for an added bit) and it’s like: we already see that guy in every other thing you do. I enjoy getting a glance at the simpler side of people like him and unfortunately, we don’t get that here.  This show tends to bring out the people behind the personas but Conan doesn’t really communicate to relate like Sean does and doesn’t listen with intent, cutting Sean off before he can finish the question and it’s peculiar to me that this was one of the most-watched Hot Ones interviews when we don’t get the experience that these interviews are known for. I wonder where this ranks for Sean among all the episodes he has done on this show. Although it wasn’t a fave of mine, it reinforces the thought that communication really is an art and Sean, at least, has mastered that.
this was your most insane guest. at first i was annoyed, but by the end i was just impressed.
This episode was golden
He's the best! 😂
😂
Conan. =)
Commit to the bit, baby!
When I'm in a bad mood I watch this for a pick me up.
There will never be another episode like this....
I loved this. Bring him back
21:12 he sounds like Tom screaming 💀💀
Dr. Arroyo reminded me of Dr. Heartman grom Family Guy😂
This is still one of the best Hot Ones episodes
I LOVE CONAN!!!! That's all. Just had to get it out.
12 million views ... seems lite
Can I request Barack and/or Michelle Obama?
Outside of Gordon Ramsay, Conan is my fav guest. He's hilarious
This is my comfort vid I can watch over and over
We love you, Conan❤!
Devils advocate here....looks potentially edited towards the end (fingers red fingers not red, holding water holding milk, etc) methinks there was a lot of vomiting off camera
Tell me how this video is inspiring? Cause I just got a💩 ton of inspiration!! Good job SIR CONAN you earned my respect!!
Conan doesn't disappoint! ❤😂😂
Aries Rock. 17th of April here!  One of the funniest episodes!  Thank you😊
Absolute legend. *wing drop*
Legend.
U the man Conan
“Doctor, can I get a pulse?” “It’s there”
Fake
This is the epitome of hot wings guest. I need this energy every time!
Legend. I love this man. Best episode ever.
Conan O'Brien is a comic genius and a legend.I have watched his career from the beginning and to me there is no one better. As for his appearance on this show which i love. Sean you're the bext man. Conan is gone now. You can have your slhow back. Respect for you both
Check my pulse, Dr.  It’s there.  I’ll send you the bill.
Conan is insane. He cruised through the bomb, and went to 600k+.
❤🔥 second viewing and Conan is a Comedy hurricane.
“WHERE!” 😂
Day 753 of requesting Kevin James!
God, HW is the best. Most interview type shows seem to exclusively bring on people that make me go “who and why tf is this person?” But Hot Ones always has the best wingmeisters.
Conan is awesome!
legend
My thoughts go to his wife or cleaning lady who has changed his bedsheets the  following day ...
“I don’t fear you wings man”  Famous last words
For 27 minutes and 21 seconds, Hot Ones became Conan's show. He threw the whole thing off track so bad and had them in such awe they didn't even ask him the last two questions. 😂😂  Absolute legend.
"This one. I'm not gonna lie. I'm feeling it a little bit." Conan 2024  Also, are we just gonna ignore that this might be the first and only guest Sean evidentially did NOT keep up with? Cuz I don't recall seeing him rub Da Bomb on himself like a crazy person...
What an absolute Animal !!!😂😂
Another guest who was surprisingly good was Henry Rollins ... no drinks at all, was just relaxed, eating all the goodies away and showing what a humble guy he is 👍.
11:15 honestly what you see with a lot of influencers and the drama that goes on with them. Granted Conan wasn't showing a dead body or filming one, but the constant grind of work and getting in a "just do it, its outrageous" mindset can be hella dangerous in one way or another
GOAT!!💯
This will never, ever be topped.
Conan, Ghandi and Popeye goes into a bar...
This is just Conan on his free time since the show ended
Wow
serioslly,,make him f g statue 1111uauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
and ,,the king od hot wings..is conan 11!!!!he needs a  statue
Where did you go to college?  1998
Conan is the real MVP
Bruh just got the a kingly acknowledgment and compliment by the god of show hosts 🥹 Conan always had me in tears with his material 😂 good memories thank you both
Conan is so funny he needs to get a show fast. 💯
the only way to out perform this episode, is simply by having conan come back for a second episode lol
“Your not a doctor” “I should be”  That killed me 25:40
Wow the best one.  Conan takes the cake. 😂
The thing is his last statement on look high and look low from Chaucer to MAD TV was beautiful
conan kind of looks like he'd be related to Bryan Cranston...
m
Don’t be a snob, read Chaucer.
Almost 10 months later and he still holds the titles of Best Guest Ever and Largest Delta Between Expected and Actual Hot Sauce Tolerance.
Legend.
It's just staaaarting to peeek through.
Heavy weight champion for years and years and years to come folks. ❤ Simply incredible ❤
Legend
I love Conan sooo much man. Absolutely brilliant...
I love Conan. He is the best! Can´t wait to see him as the Oscar´s host!
Love him 🌬️🫧🤍
Conan is the greatest dude
You know. Unfair. I want to try that sauce. But ,I’m not celebrity popular! Unfair.
My baby looked exactly like Conan and I have receipts
Love Conan.
I know I am late to the comments but Conan, age gracefully! We love you for you! The hair still rocks though lol
6:24 "the other guy"
my God !!! the pain he goes through to give us a show.   classic Conan
I love how Conan went full Charlie Chaplin in The Great Dictator at the end there!
This is the most insane thing ive ever seen
What is the music at 19:27 to 22:14 ????
Absolute mad love for conan ❤
Good lord, man. I have no words 😂. It was... healing.
This bit aged him.
Watching this for the 12388164th time, I just can't believe all the bits he has going. "Nothing is spicy," Dr Arroyo, bones in the pockets. Conan is the best to ever do it
Rick Sanchez behavior
this is very underated, one of the best episodes. Conan is amazing
Sean is genius enough to let Conan lead the show 😂😂  Both of them are geniuses.
A lot of people call other celebrities the Goat. Let it be known, that Conan O’Brien is the one true goat….
@23:44 the spilling hot sauce sent me 😂
We used to have naturally funny talk show hosts like Letterman, Conan and Craig Ferguson. Now we have Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon and that absolute waste of oxygen known as James Corden. (As a Brit I apologize for James Corden)
One bite, everyone knows the rule.
RESPECT CONAN 👏👍❤️
Generational Wizards🎉
Conan makes me laugh, but I wonder if he toned it down 50 percent if I would laugh more?
UPDATE: Conan shed his perineum the next day.
By far and away the greatest guest of all time.
Had to watch again in 2025
Conan complete Masterclass
Blarney, Birdwings and Burnin' 🔥👩‍🚒🔥👩‍🚒
Stellar performance. Too bad I didn't retain any content.
Conan OBrian went straight Eric Andre in this one.
This is both amazing and horrifying to watch.
Man is forever the hot ones legend
This is better than any food, beverage, substance, or medication at making me feel happy.
Never have I ever seen someone straight fly by DaBomb like it was just another wing. Legend.
I love this man with my whole heart
I just hear Master Shake at the end
THIS IS TO YOU! CALL THE WIFE!!!
As someone who bought the last dab lol it had the same effect on me. So I love the why don’t I feel line!! Doesn’t do much for me ether haha basic chili oil can mess me up more haha funny how peppers can hit differently for people.
What a LEGEND!
the goat
😂😂😂
this one is the best.
If Conan shaved his head, he could be a dead ringer for Sean Evans' dad
Best and most insane episode ever.
What a genius
Greatest Episode. Period. Period again....
Hands DOWN the BEST GUEST. Conan is a barbarian
stuffing the wings in his pocket? That seems like a very Flula thing to do, he's definitely been inspired
Wow, now 2025.  Anyone? ❤
Conan is so obnoxious.
The fear of god I Conan’s eyes after he drank the hot Sauce.
As a Brit this kinda reminds me of Brian Blessed hosted "Have I Got News For You"  Completely took over and derailed the show. Beautiful chaos. I recomend a watch.
I heard he dipped his tongue in wax.
The new chuck norris  Dave did good too, so did Bob O from breaking bad (better call saul dude) 😂
I think he's high on something during this! He is super funny I loved watching his show over the years
This show must be renamed to "The wild ones" after this episode
This is the single greatest episode of "Hot Ones"! #1 with a bullet! Conan is the greatest of all time!
Pure amazing lol
Undeniable legend, Conan.
Had to be the best episode. Are there any other episodes as good as this one that anyone can suggest??
During his meltdown at the end, it really shows how Conan was a writer for The Simpsons, because he rants and raves just like a character would talk on that show.
This is one of the best episodes
you gotta be a tough cookie to make it as a comedy legend. unstoppable
The President that should be on Conan's Podcast Needs a Friend is the 47th President Donald J. Trump. not Nixon or Lincoln...PERIDO
Вести себя не умеет
I heard him making the comments that usually lead tona humbling moment... and Conan didn't get humble, he dove in head first without giving in.  All the way to the last wing he was hyping more and more.  There was one little bit where he faltered, but he ran with it.  Honestly we all know he was burning up, but that man is a consummate professional in comedy.  He didn't drop character at all.
Greatest hot ones show ever! Long Live Conan
So a Harvard graduate takes over someone else’s show!
Best hot ones hands down. Conan, our hero.
😂👏
I really love the geezer so much
I had to pause this video to say that to get a compliment from Conan as an interviewer it must be the best thing ever. Conan is THE best interviewer ever and the best host.  Good for Sean!
Conan is now old!
The best and very funny. Conan is the bomb
That Conan yell should be at the end of every one of your vids
Such a Legend, It's like im watching Rick sanchez in human form.
Conan is so funny! I love him!! I can see he is getting red which means it is burning him lol
Conan is the forever winner of hot ones.
Conan is thE GOAT
Goat.
❤
Greatest hot ones episode of all time 😂
I love wings so much
😂😂😂 best of the best
😮
I had an epiphany a few years ago. Growing up, everyone speculated what would be created and broadcast if people were given free rein and the technology to be stars in their own little shows. Everyone thought it would be perverted and degenerate content. Turns out, it would be WITTY AND FUNNY. Every other thing on social media is FUNNY. some people share their skills, some share their hobbies, BUT IT IS  wits and humor that rises to the top. We humans literally spend hours recording ourselves doing the silliest things, spend hours editing the recording and put it out there ALL TO MAKE STRANGERS LAUGH. go figure.
Rough watch he is from an era where loud and obnoxious is funny. Seems like he is trying to be Farley
I havent cried laughing in so long... 😅
Conan is a national treasure
I love how Conan just gradually becomes more and more deranged as the spice increases.  For example: 21:00
15:08 are they playing the old counter strike theme?
this is the best hot ones episode XD thanks Conan you're a legend
Havent seen one of these in a while but those pringle rojo and verde are 🔥 🔥 🔥. Just wanted to let the audience know. SO GOOD. Spicy and flavor f#%*k
This will never ever be topped.  And we should all be more than fine with that. What a gift. Conan, the final boss of everything ❤
He is just amazing. Love Conan
I always thought Conan was ok funny, but he had me in tears in this by the end . Well done sir.
Sean most definitely deserves the compliment.  He is a professional; and he cares about his guests.
I now refer to “MAX” as Hubba Bubba MAX.  …for no rational reason.
😂 Conan O'Brien you're awesome thank you so much for the laughs on this video and through the years
"Everybodies got a water buffalo. Yours is big, but mine is slow. Where do we get them? Nobody knows, but everybody's got a water buffaloooooo!"  -Larry  First thing i thought of when Conan mentioned the water buffalo incident.
Not you saying your Dr is not the best😂
I fully believe this is what pushed Conan over the edge to get the Oscar gig and the Mark Twain award for comedy.
Hot wings and cool whip. Thank you Conan.
This was pure comedy
He ended up looking like an elderly woman in bright lipstick,  no offense to Conan.
Those taste buds for spice have been so under stimulated, they died years ago.
Ever the showman! Jeez!
Markiplier episode??????
1:33 😂 he may also be dyslexic
No one else can ever be on this show. This was the series finale.
I challenge anyone reading this to find 27 minutes of better content out there. There isn’t any. Legend is a word that doesn’t even come close to describing the magnificent of Conan O’Brien.
25:35 👨‍💻👏🎬
23:21 wow he is a legend
To think the classic Simpsons writer would have his own Doctor Nick Riviera
Irish Elon Musk
i love conan. such a showman.
The last two sauces are actually weaker then Da Bomb. I think Conan could tell and wanted to prove it in the most hilarious Conan sort of way.
My favorite moment will be tomorrow morning on the toilet. I doubt they'll film it, maybe just a microphone, call it"Hot Mike"👹
I cant handle American mustard😅😅
Best episode ever!!!!!!!!!!!
The fact that he was so composed after thanking a fking drink of the hottest sauce available, and never stumbled or dropped out while his face is melting, insanely  impressive.
Ya know, it IS possible to poison oneself on capsaicin. Just sayin.
never seen Sean completley lose control of his own show this is fantastic XDXDXD
First time you ever heard Conan cuss on   film 🤣🤣👍
I’m 💀☠️😂😂😂😂😂😂
The term is used pretty lightly these days. But Conan is the comedy GOAT.
this is the craziest ep i ever saw in the hot sauces series 😂😂😂😂
Conan strikes me as a guy with a very high pain tolerance.
its really getting to be annoying the whole 'you are a good interviewer'
The whole finale he looked like an insane John Wayne
ah, being at the arctic circle in Finland with reindeer and the only thought in your head is "I can't think of anything funny to say!"
I love you both so much that I simply can't take it!!!!!  My goodness
That was the best one of first we feast for sure 😅
Novacaine I'm calling it never seen someone do this on the show no way.he felt it on the way out I bet😅
Anyone else noticing the amount of makeup on Conan?   Also, this episode is amazing. 🔥🔥🔥
Conan is the funniest man alive.
Conan is to be protected at all costs.
Conan has one of the best comedic minds of all time. I'd almost say this was a set up with fake hot sauces but that was pure Conan. Anything for a bit!
I don't know what the deal is with C, but when he opens his mouth I just start to laugh
Conan was the best guest on this show and you cannot convince me otherwise
the genuine concern on Sean's face met by Conan's unhinged "I'M PERFECTLY F**KING FINE!" is just gold. Love this episode so much
Such a great guy
Conan almost went to Valhalla. WITNESS ME
Legend
23:51 'the bomb' bottle hahahaahah
This deserves so many more views
“To quote my hero, Popeye…” made me lose it 😂🤣🤣
Dude have a show without hot wings. Amazing interviewer
The whole last 5 mins😂
Was there even a question for the second to last wing?
Why is there still a show after this episode? Literally cannot be topped
Conan is the best !!!
Thank God Conan still lives. No way I’m eating that much pepper. It does NOT get much tougher than this episode of this reality show.
This was the first thing that made me laugh in a really long time.
Top 3 interviews of all time. Not 2 or 3
And this is why we love Conan.
It's 3am. Having trouble sleeping so I'm sitting in my massage chair. And the random thought to rewatch this 8 months later struck me.
The is the BEST!!!!!!!!!!
Best!!
Bro pockets his ALREADY EATEN wing!!!!
This is iconic, I think I have to watch it at least once every 6 months. 😂
God i love conan, he is the goat of talk show hosts
He is a fascinating man, a great wit and goofball all wrapped up in a gangly ranga-ball. I have met Irish folk with similar natures, and they make your happy being around them - definitely on my top 10 dinner guest list.
The 20:25 mark is HILARIOUS!!! 🤣🤣🤣
24:57 imagine this being the first time you ever see Conan and he’s doing this
Blindside.
I just kept screaming no, no no no no no no no no no no God save him please
Freeze frame at 18:31.  You'll thank me.
Truly a professional.
Conan stays my idol for reaching my peak of weirdness and absurdly wild comedy. Stay you Conan. Cheers
Smoky J is unironically one of the most delicious sauces I’ve ever had from a glass bottle.
Great man.  Do an episode where everyone in the crew has to eat the wing along with you.  And if they tap out that means theres less crew in the episode
Top 3 moments: I’M FINE SEAN🥵, MY INTESTINES ARE ACID and “but people thought that would be too POPULAR💦
Sorry but Sean seems so fake while asking questions or too formal if i put it other way and then look at conan... What a guy!! True comedians are a gifted personality!!! Would love to see jim carrey here!!!
They should’ve had DJ Khaled on with Conan so that Conan could mock DJ Khaled the whole time that the wings aren’t hot. 😂
Whos out here doing it like conan no ones doing it like conan
This is arguably one of the best videos on the internet - transcends the genre
Dr Aroyo putting the stethoscope on Sean’s tongue was an incredible moment
He should be doing the Tonight Show!
He is always overshadowed on every one of his shows. Maybe, that's the point since he is the interviewer. Yet, here he owns the room. Funny, compelling, insightful and above all...memorable. I can't believe I left it so late to watch this.
By far the best Hot Ones episode ever.
To see Conan literally do a parody of a show on the actual show. Brilliant.
Love that he refers to Leno as “the other guy”
That has got to be the best annihilation of Hot Ones I have ever seen. David Blane  has nothing on Conan O’Brien !!    🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Conan is out of his mind 😝
People barely remember Jay Leno. Maybe he’s known as that car guy now. Or Letterman that much anymore.  But Conan. We all know him. His podcasts. His remotes. His travels. And this one. We’ll remember he introduced us to that guy who prepares his body in various ways. And Sona. And Blayrt.  Losing the NBC gig was the best thing that happened to Conan and it’s a blessing for us.
I don't think anyone will ever top this interview. This is peak Hot Ones. Everything else is downhill from here Sean 😂😂🔥🔥
I have nothing but the highest respect for this man. Seriously this guy is a legend already
This has to be the most normal episode of hot ones to date
The best and manliest guest EVER on this show.
not a bead of sweat... he got us in the beginning ngl...
One of the funniest person of all time
Getting legitimate praise from Conan has to be the absolute best. Nothing better.
This is the best interview ever. Conan was Conan when he needed to be but gave us insightful serious answers to Sean’s questions that left me feeling like I know him on a more personal level. He’s a really interesting dude. I especially liked this moment 7:27 when he gave Sean his props. Sean was moved, you could tell.
Conan keeping the chicken bones 🤣
Yo da bomb is a serious drug😂..love Conan
I don’t understand how Conan was able to create a hilarious show while eating sauce that spicy. How is that physically possible??😂
Conan served, delivered, killed it. His commitment to his craft is amazing. Comedy king! 👑 😂🙌🏼🔥🔥
Where's the clip of conan getting flipped?
Conan is a comedy God.. I haven’t laughed this long in ages 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Best episode I’ve seen to date with a legend!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He took alot
The best, straight funny savage.
I don't fear your wings, man
Best guest ever!! beast mode
Conan is a madman..I'm loving it.
Well that did not disappoint....
There is no one in comedy or tv like Conan.  His unique self deprecation style with his commitment to the bit is unmatched by anyone.
That was one of the greatest things I have ever watched.
This is why Conan will always be the GOAT of guests. Most charismatic Man I've ever seen in front of a camera.
Best hot ones I've ever seen in my life!!
Conan finally pulled off a Norm McDonald!!!
This is the best thing i've ever seen ever. I've watched 5x  and i'm not done
I work with a guy that behaves like Conan in this episode, and the guy has gotten COVID multiple times, is now deaf in one ear, and blames everyone but himself.  A semi-unstoppable force.
He is the spice
Wow😂
Dude goes hard 🥵
amazing
this encapsulates why conan is the best late night host
GOAT
Absolute legend
The greatest Hot Ones guest of all time!
anyone watching it in 2025
We love you Conan
Is he trying to imitate Robin Williams by going completely crazy and funny?
I’m soooooooo in love with all of the Conan love in the comments. How he still doesn’t have his talk show is beyond me, I will never get over his comparison to ANY big talk show these days, they will never compare to how phenomenal Conan is.
Conan is as strong as THE MOLECULAR MAN
No wonder he was one of my favorites. Looking back sometimes i wonder was it just me being a child and giggling at the goofy flirting? But not it’s clear Conan is a master and professional.
Respect 💪🏽
i used to pretend i was asleep and watch your show, Coco. Mf'er in his sixties slobbering milk just so we can have a good time
best episode
The best
Está como una cabra 😂😂😂😂  y es un campeón 🎉
I've enjoyed your video's but this guy is so weak, I had to turn it off.
Best Hot Ones ever
😂😂😂 wow Conan chief hot ones!! Hands down roll out the red carpet 🤟🤟😂😂
How much Coke was consumed before this…
"Call the wife!"   - Conan
This man is pure entertainment! What a legend. Amazing interview
what a lunatic...FANTASTIC CONAN!!!!
That was absolutely amazing. The best. I don't think Ive laughed like that for like 10 or 15 years 😭
22:55 the build the whole episode has to this moment is just pure gold.
Conan is the mvp, heisman winner, super bowl champ of hot ones period
Conan's got that red head pain tolerance just as an outright skill......for anyone that doubts it's an actual thing.....THIS
Conan is truly a legend. He is in control and doing his best to make a great show even when he was in a huge deal of pains…
revisited 8 months later, still the greatest hot ones guest EVER
Say what you want the man is a master of his craft, it’s not just throwing a joke out here and there it’s being able to control comedy, you have to be passionate about it
I love Conan.😂
Thank you for "chubs chubs" Conan
@cameraman-bonus-content  Awesome show guy! Didn't know BPL represented here! AMAZING!
Iconic
Likely the most epic hot ones I’ve ever seen.
True motha f-ing SAVAGE !
It's the cumulative sauces that make the last few sauces extreme.   The last few sauces aren't extreme without the earlier cumulative sauces.🤔   It's all in your mouth one after the other,  and your mouth isn't given the chance to recover before the next one.   (It's all the sauces).🤨
I've said this before, if you do a fake caugh and let it turn into a real caugh, hiccups stop. it's never failed me
Don't let Conan's amazing performance here make you forget how disappointed you were of both Gordon Ramsey's and Zlatan's performances and those guys are supposed to be hard and tough.
Conan is a national treasure 😅
The GOAT
🐐
Who knew conan could go that hot
Conan in starting to look like Trumps illegitimate, on the spectrum, little brother, whose role model is Ace Ventura pet detective.
I like to think this interview is what convinced the Academy to get Conan to host the Oscars.
The spicier it gets the more Conan becomes🤣 Nicolas Cage
''Can I keep these?!''' i died ;DDDD
Conan is just a Steve-o without self destructive tendencies
theres no way that, that is his physician?
Conan always makes me laugh.
Insane. Perfect. A gift.
Conan is the best guest ever. Epic!!!!
5:30 Not at all used to hearing Conan curse lol it doesn’t sound right to me
It was nice for Lil Wyane to lend his coat to Conan.
The follow up of his Podcast after this episode he explains what happened to him after 😂😂 Its not disappointing 🤣
Conan just became relevant to me.
this was too funny!!! conan is the best! hahahaha
saw people voting for this to be the best episode and i wanna know if they are trolling? this wasn't funny or authentic but rather annoying, whats happening?
The anti-White stuff is why Kamala lost. White people civilized all  of you.
I love Conan so much !
Unrelated question: is conan wearing the same jacket as bill burr in his video?
Conan O’Brien is completely overrated😳🥺😏🤔
Conan is always such an awesome vibe. Love this dude. This must be the best hot ones episode😂
Forever an absolute legend
I can’t believe I missed this one. Came here from their recent poll. Conan absolutely knocked this out of the park 😂
I think that this is the hardest that I have laughed at Conan. I was laughing during the first wing and completely lost it when he was rubbing sauce on his hands amd chest.  I have not tuned in for a while but I have a hard time believing that there was a better or funnier guest. The closest I have seen someone invoking what I would expect from the late great Robin Williams.
I've seen them all ..... that was nuts ! Lololo😂
Wow, Conan totally rocks! He took Da Bomb like a real dude's dude!
Outstanding.
5:53 he touched near his eyes. That's when he started losing it
Well, Caveman?
This was the best Hot Ones from this year. 2024🎉
Oh, you guys need to bring Kevin Nelson on the show! I wonder how much more chaotic would he turn when ‘’on spice’’ 😂
Make no mistake, this is Conan Remote 😂😂😂
LEGEND
Probably one of the most gross, offputting, hilarious, relatable episode of Hot Ones to date. Legend, Conan.
Conan O'brian telling you "you're a good interviewer" and telling you "you ask good questions " must feel amazing
The BEST comedian !!! 😂😂
6:01 that’s a BRILLIANT question.  I’ve always wondered!!
Best episode ❤
auction off  Conan's jacket, for profit
He turned into Chris Farley so fast and unexpectedly
23:41 wow, i like conan even more after bringing the bible into it.
This is the greatest hot ones episode of all time.
This is a mess
Being told by Conan that you are very good interview is extremely high praise
This episode will be clearly visible in all the endoscopies he gets.
DANG CONAN’S TALL
Best episode ever !
qué máquina se pasó
My fav Conan
Conan is a savage
Hes the only late night host that made me laugh as a kid in 2001. Been a fan since.
I’ve never seen such a charismatic, hyperactive Irishman like Conan 😂😂😂
holy cow iv  lauaghed much
Hot ones fans: he is a savage Conan fans: average conan experience  XD thats why is the GOAT
The amount of fluids coming out of this man's mouth was off putting
I felt the pain through the screen lolol😂😂
Horrid to watch this one
Absolute professional, team coco
This is the number one interview on hot ones it’s going to be hard to dethrone this king. Conan is the man!
Conan said I ain't see spice til 52
Iconic
Ughh 🤢
16:53 to the end just got crazier and crazier
lol 😂😂😂😂😂 I needed that laugh
Best guest in FWF history
Oh sh*it!
Also my birthday 😮
Beat episode fr
Conan O’Brian evolved during this interview
“But of course, I never listen to Andy” 😂😂😂
Conan has such a huge Arin Hanson energy here, i love it!
Conan o Brien is the funniest and smartest guest of hot ones.  Ever.  Harvard degree can’t be wrong
Conan was, is, and will always be the best!
21:15😂bro has no filter
I still want to see the origin how this show can have celebrities eating hot wings . I mean any YouTuber can do the same but they can never get celebrities but yet every celebrity can be proud they got on this channel.
4th or 5th time watching this. Must be the millennial in me but it doesn't get old
Predicting bee arthurs death by 1 month is crazy
Love conan!
Conan, you are a legend!
But why
Lots of incredible people on this show. But, that goofy guy took it
A monster that talks😂 Conan the barbarism 😂
I wonder if he'd have done as well with and old school sauce lineup? A bit of mad dog 357 or one of blairs concoctions, the recent sauce lineups have been tamed down quite a bit but i imagine it makes guests more willing to go on.... Its ok hot ones youve given the celebs a false sense of security now, bring back the big heat.
Conan is the best! 😂
The way Conan commits 100% to this "bit" (whether he likes to call it that or not) is the same reason he got on the water buffalo...
I have watched this maybe 20 times. Please invite him back!
Conan is the GOAT, at the end it reminded me of when Homer went crazy with the nuclear chili he eats and goes crazy.
This man is insane!!! I love him
Best episode
22:59 oh dear god, my favorite
Dufuq?
In retrospect, pouring this sauce on the wing and licking it off... 😂😂😂
I don’t see how people can actually live after eating that much spice.
Hands down the best Hot Ones to date!!!
Conan is the funniest out of all the comedians. He was 30 years ago when I first saw him on tv, and he still is now. What I wouldn't give to see him be a talk show host again.
Conan absolutely wins. Hands down.
My favorite talk show host
The best hot ones episode! Love you Conan 😂😂
Complete legend.
Conan referring to jay leno as “the other guy” the same way mark ruffalo’s bruce banner refers to the hulk…makes me smile.
Conan could be the Weasley’s fun uncle
Gingers are impervious to hot sauce.
Poor water buffalo
This is the only Hot Ones episode i continuesly watch on repeat lol. Phenomenal
What an absolute legend
This man is an American treasure. (Conan). He is just always so ahead of his time, I'm afraid he won't be appreciated untill he is gone:(
Conan is a legend. One of the best talk show host and comedian there ever was. A loyal, humble, good, irish, immature, childlike, goes into character whenever he doesn't want to face reality, people's person. God bless him.
What’s wrong with me why can’t I feel? 😂   Conan is truly a multigenerational talent. In 50 years from now we will still be coming back to his work. Yet somehow I still feel as if he is underrated & undervalued, but the real ones know Conan is the GOAT
BEAST
Worst video ever,  conan is definitely the worst guest
That was hilarious!
Was not expecting someone to willingly stash the wings and save them for later
I love conan, miss norm
Rewatching, and it's still THE BEST episode!
Giving Rick off of Rick and morty vibes and im here for it
Do one with David Letterman!
GOAT episode
He keeps the wings in case he needs to reverse engineer an antidote later.
We need Conan back on late night before i/he dies
lame, overdid it, annoying.
I didn't find this nearly as humorous as others.  I'm just here to see if they respect the Show and the Wing. The bite under my criteria he gets a pass.  Respecting the show he made Sean laugh but not me.  I think Sean might have been under duress.
I hope I'm not the only one that caught the reference of is there anything I need to know about this second sauce Smokey J. THC Crew
Best to ever do it
This is by far the Best episiode Ever! Bring him back!
Phenomenal. More power to your talent, Conan. 🔥💯
He' crazy 😅 Love him 💘
Conan is the only talk show host who is actually good. Literally the only good one I've seen.
I actually died vicariously watching Conan consume that much hot sauce.
For anyone else, this is a full mental breakdown. For Conan, this is a thing he did to be funny before his other more important thing where he’s paid to be funny.
This episode was bad. Conan interjected himself onto the show. He needs to let the host Sean run the show. It was really annoying.
I ❤ Conan!
This was EPIC 😂😂😂😂😂
This is going in the internet hall of fame one day
Crying & laughing to this one 🤣🤣 Best episode of First We Feast ! 🤣🤣
Who’s here to rewatch this bcs nothing else comes close
This needs 100M views where u all at
Yooooo 😂😂😂😂 Conan is hilarious
What was with putting the wings in his pockets?
He's in a state of drunkenness and the defense mechanism is golden😅
This is why Conan is a goat
Can you get Andy or both together that would be cool
One of the best shows ever
This was absolute bonkers 😂 I don't know why I kept skipping watching Conan, but I finally did and it was hecticana 😂
"hes not the best, but very affordable" 😁
Ive seen em all go back and do your homework this aint the best its top though
He has set an unpassable bar.
Is he alright?😂
Best Hot Ones yet!
RIP to his parents! Thoughts & Prayers!
He’s in extreme pain….but will not admit it. ..
My soul left my body for him.
17:23 opiniones oks like Conan has lipstick
This was cinema
By far - the best episode of Hot Ones.
I love me some Conan, but the way he wipes his greasy hands on his shirt makes me cringe so hard.
How good would Conan be as the  Joker?
Love u conan❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Oh my god conan obrain is back ❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉cant waite
Oh My God 😂 Conan so coo coo
i came here for Conan, Literally.
Conan is the best
BEST ONE EVER.
Legend episode😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
My favorite one. Hands down
Conan is a lizard
Sean is wisely not matching the guest on this one 😂 I think this is my 3rd time watching this episode in it's entirety.
I would TOTALLY cry if I met Conan 😂 And yes, I'm in the demographic.
Easily the best guest ever
Conan would make a good Joker
Long live the king of hot ones.
This is the best Hot Ones ever! I love Conan!👍
This is the most YOLO hot ones I've ever seen
Getting praised by conan for interviewing is like michael jackson saying you can sing, mustve been nice being praised like that by someone at the top of that field
The greatest Hot Ones of all time!
Best episode, hands down
Conan is truly insane
Saddest thing to happen to the guy, losing both his parents in 3 days. He doesn't deserve that. Love this man.
I love Conan O'brien
Whenever they think of having Conan as a guest little do they know that they actually invited him to host lol
How is this vid less views than Ramsay?!😂
Conan is awesome😂
Conan: “You’re not a real doctor, are you?” Dr. Arroyo: “I should be.” 😂😂😂
GOAT
Idk if anyone else thought of this but when he was putting the wings in his pocket i kept thinking of that jacket Fabio wore in BTR that had a pocket to keep your food warm.
Conan has been my favorite entertainer since I was in my late teens. He has never let me down. I've seen him be let down plenty enough. But Conanando? Even in the face of adversity he's a true blue living example of somebody who's actually worth looking up to.
Conan O'brien I absolutely love you🙌🙌🙌😜❤🤗
Whatever drugs this man was on... i want some
😂🤭
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥EPIC 🙌 💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥 @conanobrien 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌💯
...all while the hot sauce spilling over the side of the table.
This conan guy is going somewhere. I hope he makes it. possibly even host a tonight show....
"MISTAKE! I like to announce my mistakes up front."
Incredible 😂😂😂😂
😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤😂❤
I need to join a Vintage Baseball league…
21:03 DA BOMB took another one but Conan went beyond beyond Insanity. 24:15 yeah, he's gone for good. What a great host!!!!
Tears in my eyes!  Absolute classic.  After one of the funniest plugs of all time, I will definitely be watching his show on "Max".
Sean should of mirrored Conan in the eating part.
Epic!!!!!!
I was seriously worried. There's comedy and there's insanity. I think he genuinely crossed over a little bit.  Conan must have an incredible pain tolerance.  That was ABSOLUTELY LEGENDARY.
Conan is so much funnier when not rehearsed...
My favorite late night host comedian. High IQ high vibe, he's so obstreperous and wild. How he set up the whole thing on the fly and in crescendo, GOAT!
😂😂😂 Conan’s mad underrated funny
Conan rulz🎉❤
Bow to the master! Conan, you are the absolute GOAT.
I don’t know if he can actually handle the heat, or if he feels it 100% but is such a good performer that he can keep it together despite the pain
We found the new Timon and Joker
If you dont save the bones for go-gurt style marrow you're missing out.
Conan is the goat! No one can come close to him
Dude tries way too hard! So forced!
That was fine 🤣
That was unhinged 😂😂😂
Rarely do i leave comments, but this is my absolute favorite episode! Conan has always been hilarious in my eyes, and this solidifies his comedic genius.
Comedy genius doesnt even cut it. Love you Coco
I have my favorite but this might be the most entertaining 😂😂😂😂
17:45 best decision he ever made was putting that down 😂😂😂
17:13 I’m definitely clipping the ‘I’m feeling it a little bit’ for an soundbite outro on a song
good job boys! Bravo <3
I could watch this 100000000000x
What an absolute beast of a man! 😂 Probably the best episode ever! ❤
I watched this 7 months ago, but it feels like yesterday. Geez, really, time does really go fast.
I didn't think it possible but he was even less funny than he is on his own show.
The Great Jester King of Late Nite😊
His pocket lol
I saw the Hot Ones rankings and had to watch this one. No one will ever top Conan on Hot Wings. If this era feels cursed otherwise, we have truly been blessed here 🙏🏻
Im missing the audience laugh
Im missing the audience laugh
Man, I love Conan!
He is so focused.
sean looks petrified
Frick he’s good
I never laughed so hard this is great. Conan was a guest and host while parodying himself and the show and the same time.
16:35 was it a 4 year medical school?  it was supposed to be 😂😂😂😂 underrated dr arroyo
"IM FINE, IM PERFECTLY F*CKIN FINE" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love this interview
It’s funny every time. I’ve watched it all the way through 5 times, and it still never gets old
Son: Da, can I have a taste of spice?  Dad: So you want to bring sin into this house?
Conan is the true Barbarian.
Is he pocketing the wings to protect his DNA or just trying to be funny? 🤔
This is the best episode 😂
lol a wise and stable man
What's funnier than Don Quijote, Sancho Panza ....thank u Connan😊
This was absolutely insane I’m impressed.
10 YEARS ON NOW THIS WILL BE ON FLYINGGOLDEN DISC IN SPACE
TRYING TO SHOW SEAN HOW TO EXPRESS SOME FORM OF EXCITMENT
THE KING !!!!!!
I'm in tears and can't stop crying! Hands down the best Hot Ones episode EVER! Conan is the GOAT! 🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥
Total pro.
I've noticed Sean didn't mirror Conan like he does all other guests, not once did he drink hot sauce, Conan kind of made him break character
This is the most epic episode I have ever seen on here!
That was the best thus far
dude... conan is a beast!
this has got to be the best episode ever
😂😂😂👍🏻
What a weird dude.
Conans gotta get on the Hot Ones hall of fame for this one🔥🔥🔥🔥
I haven't laughed like this in years. Thanks, guys!
Greatest hot ones show ever 😂🫠
love his acting 😂😂😂
Wow, Conan has a new show on YouTube eating hot chicken🤣 Sean is a great interviewer, but Conan really took that thing over. This is my favorite episode.
Is this a copy of Chickenshop Date?
Conan the barbarian. Hot Wings King
Conan is insane but funny😂😂
Conan is insane! I love it!
14:06 I find this funny because apparently, all sauces on the table excluding the last dab are display only and most are expired lol
4:03 TAME IMPALA MENTIONED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
looking forward to the day conan returns to hot wings...
What a performer.  And a great human.
😂😂oh he hurt me on that one. Funniest ever
Well done
Sean Did not match the energy on this episode🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
this was incredible and tht entire outro made me burst out laughing
THE BEST HOT ONES EVER
@6:26 “the other guy”.. probably referring to Jay Leno 😂
Smoky Jay had a rolling Jay Leno joke, Sean :/
K I've been binging this the list few days and this is by far the most unhinged episode I've seen
“They used to call it HBO but people found that too popular” greatest comic ever
Great guests always have something interesting to say and Conan is a great guest.
Conan is a madman and I love him for it
The end he channeled farley
16:57 reminded me of Robin Williams
Best episode ❤
He’s right I didn’t learn a thing when he visited his homeland of Ireland other than the chips Taytos😂. Conan conquers with comedy always. I can’t believe these hot sauce even exist to that level of heat, how is that even safe for the organs😬
The best!
God i love Conan
Absolute Legend.
I just love it when the guests really help the advertising part. selling the show... Awesome move!
Seth eyes watering as Conan drinks the hot sauce 😂😂
I absolutely LOVE Conan O’Brien ahhhhh ima have to watch that show I love when he be invading places!!!
@DJ Khaled
I love this man….
Is he even a real doctor?
Didn’t think anyone could out do Ramsey but Conan knocked it put of the park 😂😂😂😂
17:26, what you shouldn't feel after your date
I watch this episode at least once a month, legendary
I love the idea of Conan having a doctor since 1999, a doctor that finished his university one year prior
The only episode I watch till the end❤
CALL THE WIFE took me out
This is the best episode. “ what’s wrong with you people you don’t k ow what real danger looks like anymore 😅
This is a setup.  They did not actually use the really hot sauces on the wings just to be more careful with Conan.  He had almost no reaction to the hottest sauce and went on to do his funny bits and exaggerate. The doctor segments are brilliant.
Conan probably requested two separate tables as a pre-show power move
Conan is absolutely awesome! So funny, so commited.
Why is Conan the only person on the planet with that hair style
Coco !!! Finally! Thank you Sean ❤
My favorite Hot Ones show.  Conan is insane.
22:43 The way Conan stopped moving so he could process the mistake he just made is making me cackle 😂😂😂
I'm fine!🥹🥹🥹🤣🤣🤣🤣
savage🤯
11/10
oh my god the pain lolololololololol
Ok I was feeling so-so about the dr arroyo bits until he put the stethoscope on his tongue and said “yeah it’s not good” 😂💀
Just re-watching this again, just because…
How is this just 12M views, easily the best episode in history
Best episode ever. Conan OBrien furiously devouring hot wings will forever live rent free in my mind ❤
Gordon Ramsay take notes.
honestly loved this episode so much bravo conan
this guy is such a wus. even in his show he's a wus.
A masculine tall man with a good heart is on the show. Who would have guessed he would take a sip from the strongest bottle directly.
Did expect Conan to completely Dominate these wings 😮
why is he putting them in his pocket???
lol he is so funny
Is Sean the dumbest person a live
This is the greatest episode of Hot Ones to date. It has moments of Network 1976 about it.
he was not fazed by da bomb, Conan is a barbarian
Conan is the best, I laughed the whole time, comic genius
There is no wrong answer to the question what is the greatest hot ones interview but it’s this one.
Pours more sauce. Another one. Pours more sauce. Another one. Pours more sauce. Another one. Pours more sauce.
I didn't really know what to expect when i saw conan on the Show...however, it went exactly how i would have guessed.
I'll have whatever Conan had before the show
Its 1 in the morning,, i have shouted woahhhh!!! And laughed so hard!!!!!!  Conan is the real deal!!!!
Conan is such a hero!
Conan is a beast!
Conan is pro comedian
Conan has now set the bwr so high , no celebrity might cross it ever.......best episode.....🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤😊
Hands down man. Massive Respect.  Thats how you do it...conan slayed it.☘️🤟🤟🤟🤟🥂
i hope elon buys msnbc and gives conan a show. im not sure why he would, i just want it to happen.
21:20 best part
Best interview in the world. Impressive.
When the doctor put the hearing device on Sean's tongue 😂😂
"read wide"
Conan is The real life Rick Sanchez
Charlie Rose show eating hot wings comment is gold
*What's wrong with mE WhY CANT I FEEEEEL?!?!*
Sean looks legit scared after what Conan did with The Last Dab 😂😂😂😂
Wow! Really amazing and resistent to hot sauce!
Putting the wings in his pocket was already off the cuff... then when he started to chug down the hot sauce is when this became the most legendary episode.
One of the best improv geniuses
Total credit to Conan. That’s real big boy performance 😮
Hottest wings are in South Korea 😂🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now look back, I can't explain that insane self-destrucive improv but Conan is so cool
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂 too funny!
Bro keeps katana better than some wrestlers these days
not gonna lie, he had me going on the water buffalo bit lol
He may be the best guest ever lol what a machine. Love both of these guys
I can't believe he did that, I've had the last dab and I have a hyper high spice tolerance but drinking it would be absurd
Conan slayed
Covid? 🤣🤣🤣
Best 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Conan is his own man 😎🤣🖖🏻🥸
horrible guest i was disgusted all the way!
So mad I'm just now watching this. Conan you're the man 😂😂😂😂
Man he did the best I think
Definitely my favorite episode. This is one of the best interview shows LOL.
Threw up after looking at the boogers,snot, chicken and milk on his face and mouth 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
as you get older, you can't tolerate this type of hot, it burns the outer membrane of your mouth and tongue
Incredible 😂😂😂
Time stamp 21:09 yooooooooooo😂😂😂😂
Why didn't this show up on my feed?  I had to see reference to it from a different podcast.  Conan is just a beast!!
Why was he keeping the bones in the jacket
Conan is a legend!!! He's the best ever! He absolutely killed it!
This is the hardest I've laughed in like, a decade. Conan's an absolute closer. A freak of nature. The ultimate showman.
o m f g.
That you’re gonna die dude look was hilarious
Conan.... a Harvard grad.... let that sink in.
Rewatching this episode because it’s 🐐
Thats Saitama
By far, Conan is one of the best guests ever. Sooo dope. Lol.
This is the best Hot Ones EVER I watch it monthly LOL
J'aime péter dans l'eau ❤
By far the best episode
Hiding his DNA in his pocket 🤔
Conan O'Brien is a comedy God. Nuff said.
That was disgusting and hilarious.
The best
Conan the goat
The last part was hard to watch
He made me sick watching him over acting never again 🤑😎😎😎
The last one really got him 😂😂
It would have been so awesome if he had kept it together all through and not completely lose it at the end
Conan would be a prefect MAGA president. Performing like a criminal lunatic and be clever like Bernie Sanders....
Truly an icon in all aspects. He deserves all the praise
This sean interview was great episode on hot ones with conan
Conan is the one who knocks
14:00 👁👄👁  i will never go wrong watching this guy
Best guest.
Back to watch again after Conan was announced to host the Oscars - this episode is 100% the reason why that happened
Best hot ones épisode ive seen
This was the best one I’ve seen.
"CALL THE WIFE!!" 🗣
This guy was great! He should get his own show!
Absolute legend
I'm glad I caught this months later. I don't have to wonder if he's going to survive the longer term effects of chugging that hot sauce....
Conan brought it like always!
Would've been gold if Dr. Aroyo took a bite everytime Conana handed him a wing 😂
Doctor, my pocket is full😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ohhh nooo---dont put your finger on your eyes
can't wait until Conan goes away
Reminds me of Robin Williams at 21:00 🤯
14:01 when the interview takes a complete turnover
best show ever 😂
This is the funniest and best hot ones episode ive seen, hahah, cannot stop laughing. Conan is a beast!
He should be called Conan the Barbarian, because that was savage!
1998, where? ohhhh out of state 😂😂😂😂
This was the greatest episode in the history of the show.
Conan isn’t human. lol
When the need to entertain is so strong you put yourself through pain! 😂
Conan is the goat
HAHAHAHA BEST HOT ONES FOR ME!!! 😂😂😂
How does this only have 12 million views, this is gold
I once saw Conan in a pepper eating contest in Mexico, 9 months later all the 276 children born were redheads
Best hot ones ever
image of podcast is the same jacket.
Oscar Panel: (watching Conan have a meltdown) Thats our 2025 host.  (watches Conan spit milk out of mouth) ....and our 2026 host.
Wow Conan is the goat.
Never knew he was so tall😮
Dude the end of him made me burst out crying of laughing I can’t stop laughing at him. I gotta love Conan more bruh he’s hysterically a legend 🤡
how in the world is there is thumbs down on this vid? Must be Jay Leno fans.
4:03 *groovy bass starts playing*
his b-day is one day past my sister's.. and that's so odd.. I remember hers due to tax season.
Conan the only late night host I watched. Conan by far one of my favorite comedians. I still love his Conan needs a friend podcast. The wings in the pocket is legendary.😂
Why I see pain in his comedy nowadays😢😢
Best guest everrrrr! Conan the king of the bomb sauce...tooo funnyyyy
23:00
I’ve always respected Conan
Im terrified XD Im literally screaming watching this LOL.
Conan was incredibly wired as a result of how he beasted the wings and the sauce. I Hope he saw a real doctor after the show.🤣
This was kinda disturbing, like low-key horror movie material
Dude is hard
Conan will always be hilarious. If there’s a host that knows comedy it’s him
Team Coco 4 Life!
this made me cry. Conan is the best. He's made me laugh probably more than anyone else on planet earth. Dudes clearly got an amazing attitude to life and comedy. I wish there were more comedians around who died by comedy and appreciated it all like this guy.
Conan is the greatest of our generation
His face!  So gross. 😂
I’m fairly new to hot ones, but I have been binging it nonstop for the past month. Conan O’Brien is a beast!
Not only is he hands-down the greatest talk show host of all time. He's also the hot sauce monster!!!!!!!!! 😦😦😦😦😦😦
Hilarious!!
Legend. Absolute best guest ever. I will always bow down to Conan.
I'm only here for Conan! I am his biggest fan!
The true king of comedy takes his bow. I haven't laughed that hard in months.
Mans a bit gross. Yelling loud isnt funny. This is like over correcting for old TV host antics by going straight into yells and fortnite dances. This is genuinely disgusting. The frames on his face spitting...who thinks that's good tv? Let talk shows die, for the love of god.
That moment from :37 to 25:35! Love that moment!😂
Ah, Conan.   Ever the 10-year old child who is actually 90...
I love Conan miss his late night show too tho
This is the best episode eveeeeer❤❤❤❤❤
Conan is THE LEGEND
Conan is a true folk hero. I love Dr. Arroyo! He's the best and most inexpensive doctor in the desert.
Conan is really the best
best episode yet!
I can't really deal with people with food on their face. It's one of the only things that grosses me out. But for this episode, I managed to overcome that because Conan is, and always has been, an ABSOLUTE LEGEND!
Conan gets more unhinged with age and I'm 100% down with this 😂
Legendary episode from a legend
This isn't the best hot ones episode, it's the greatest video on YouTube. Conan the absolute GOAT
Something tells me Conan didn't wash his hands through his journey to eat wings.
One of your best episodes
I just have to say I got that spicy ramen you can get at Walmart and it felt like eating razor blades halfway thru so I cannot imagine how Conan is feeling. I did finish the ramen tho even tho I was crying
❤
Conan really be turning into a hot sauce at the end of the video 😂
I expected no less from Conan, when I heard he was on hot ones I immediately jumped on YouTube. He is the greatest of all hosts.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
What a Legend!
Did he visit Columbia before the show? ;)
Conan is the real one!
What was that haha!
Legend
Host : It's dangerouse around the eyes Conan : I AM THE DANGER
we will never ever see funny human as CO again 😢   absolute brilliant true comedian 🧡
I always come back to this episode
Gotta be the best episode yet
Love Conan. Hilarious.
22:18 he's looking into heaven and he sees no god above him
The best entertainer of all time. No regard for himself. It's all about the audience. Just entertain.
O'Brien advocating for reading classics like the Chauster tales while wildly gesticulating with a hot sauce bottle with spittle on his face and hot sauce rubbed on his shirt is not something I've expected to see tonight but I'm not complaining
This is epic! 😂
“THESE AREN’T THE RANTINGS OF A MAN WHOSE HAD SOME BAD CHEMICALS”
5:35 he turned into hal from malcom in the middle
Conan talking about HBO Max/Max the way he did, I have had those exact thoughts so many times... like ... why?
Is it accurate to say 'The Conan' is a very specific form of pompadour?
Insanity!!!
This was the most funny yet oddly disturbing episode of hot ones I’ve ever seen
Best Hot Ones ever. Totally hilarious!!
Honestly kind of ruined it....we get it you're Conan.. your random out of pocket antics might have been funny like fukn 10 years ago. Now it's just him doing anything he can to have complete control lol
the man is a treasure
Imagine Robin Williams on this show
My lifes ambition would be to meet Conan, he would definitely get the tearful reaction he's used to from my demographic. That man shaped my entire sense of humour, mostly through his time on the Simpsons
Comparing this to the DJ Khalid episode is a night and day difference
This is easily the best episode of Hot Ones ever. I came back to rewatch half a year later.
Jordan Schlansky needs to be on this show
I like Conan. I like Jimmy Fallon.  I like this episode.  I LOVED Jimmy Fallon's.
Am I the only one who re-watches this episode every two months lol
He’s getting his joke ark on
What's interesting, and easy to forget, is that the Conan we saw on his TV show was a _character_. It's wasn't Conan. This is more of the real Conan. Letterman was the same way. When you heard him when he wasn't being "Dave Letterrrrrmannnn" he was shockingly serious and smart.
12:49 he's wearing the same jacket as he's wearing on HotWings!!
😂😂😂😂😂
CONAN I LOVE YOU! Such a good person, just making the world a better place. Mwah.
"give her this... and this.... and then these" "thank you doctor" "oh I'm not a doctor"
Makes me sad that conan is basically stuck behind h3h3 productions i thought that he would at least be in 20 mil territory by the end of the year
The G.O.A.T! No question.
“Where did you go to medical school?”  “In 1998” Perfect comedy
Conan is by far my favorite late night host. I wish he was back on the late night circuit. He’s super funny but he’s genuine and a great guy at heart.
I love Conan. He isn't "always on", he just is.
LEGENT!!!!🎉🎉🎉
You know he's from the Television, even broadcast news type Television, as opposed to movies, when he calls a location shoot a "remote." Been a while since I heard that...  Dude, what an absolute consummate professional. Complete fkng legend, so naturally funny, but combined w/ three effing decades of "conversational improv" comedy or w/e you wanna call it. So like, practiced & experienced, combined w/ being a totally naturally talented just funny dude. & so effing REAL that the only time he's not being real is when he's being completely obviously fake for comedic effect.  10/10. I'll be rewatching this for the next twenty years, & I'm sure laughing even harder then than I am now.
at 25:30 it looks like Conan had forgot there was other people in the studio and was simultaneously surprised and happy for the applauds 😂
Conan, my hat is off to you! Unbelievable!
8:00 it's there killed me 😂
G.O.A.T Conan
THAT WAS TOO FUNNY! There wasn’t a moment when his pace dropped, it’s incredible, joke after joke a perfect timing and precision, up and up we went.  And his skit with the Dr. Arroyo was great, he did a great job too, delivering the jokes and knowing his part. AMAZING EPISODE!
Impressive....most Impressive
I'm a big Conan fan, but I think Conan missed the mark. This show is famous for its sincerity, and he treated it like a skit. He didn't know Sean, and it comes across as disrespectful.
Conan is the goat of comedy on this alone. This is legendary.
this is the greatest episode
Is that voice shrieking? Don't take it to heart, my friend😉
By far THE best guest on this show!! Watched it multiple times. The hubby and cat love it too!
God I love Conan. I would’ve killed to see him live when he was still on tv.
After having Da Bomb, its actually kind of insane how well he handled that.
that ending is hysterical
Lol, he handled this like a champ. Respect.
And... It's Conan O'Brien dominating the competition to give the United States it's first Hot Sauce gold medal. What an absolute legend 🎉
Conan has always been my favorite and this performance just takes him into absolute demi-god status. What an insane and legendary man.
How can you not like Conan?😂😂😂
Show host interviews show host, well how the turn tables
I just love Conan so much. One of the greatest showmen of all times.
Conan is auditioning for the joker lol Now watch the DJ Khalid episide 🤣
CONAN IS AMAZING 🤣🤣🤣
I have no doubt that Conan is impervious to pepper spray
The GOAT.
THIS IS HOW YOU END A FREAKIN SEASON !! I LOVE CONAN !!😂😂😂
Holy cow autoplay from Ludacris to Conan... 🙈
There is no reason to downvote this video unless you are a total idiot and square.
What a mad man!! Wow
Conan is the funniest person alive.
i wish i could just pay Hot Ones to let me on the show. such a cool concept.
Suomi mainittu
I love how he didn't care about his image the joke is on him just how many people on Hollywood does that.
Conan in GTA 6
Yo Conan is the best guest ever fr 😂😂
Conan's mouth looking like a yucky zombie.  So gross lol!
11:50 Naah, it’s ok, we have pockets
Conan is the absolute best
What a BOSS!!!!! Absolutely THE BEST episode ever. Conan deserves an Emmy for this. Mind blowing! I have a bottle of Da Bomb and I LOVE spice. But to watch him conquer it without flinching is the stuff of legends. WOW.
Conan o brien by far top 10 guest... love the collab
*23:29* well said!!  oh my gosh I love him 🫶🏻
now go and watch the DJ Kolide Hot Ones episode. A man that whines about health and has a fridge dedicated to prue frozen sugar I.V bags "ice cream". Choose your heros wisely kids.
i think he is high on drugs or something, or its just him being silly.
He really had to do the licking at THE BOMB!!! I can't stop laughing!
Conan O'Brien is such an inspiration for anyone who wants to make/produce a show and/or comedy, I swear.
This is the best one yet…
🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀
This is my personal favorite. If I have had a bad day, I watch this and it makes me laugh every time. I love Conan.
I love this guy
We need dr arroyo to be the next guest
I don’t expect anything less from coco
This is the best episode.
24:57 Conan is officially my Hero
This is BY FAR the best episode I've seen it's so funny!!!
No episode  Will ever top this
Conan was a Hot sauce G😂🔥
!!!
Legend for real.
This guy is funny, good catch Sean.
get drake on here.
GREATEST EPISODE EVER
This is their only guest I have laughed out loud. Good job Conan😂❤
Why did it take me this long to find this episode 😂
What a performance wow 😂
Irish people are crazy on so many levels
this is, by far, the most unhinged episode of this show ever. Fantastic.
Conan wasted no time to unlock BOSS MODE. Drinking hot sauce neat, from the bottle, establishing dominance.
16:30 Here it comes…
Conan being a boss.
7:50 “You just feel for the pulse…” —“Yeah, it’s there.” 😂
legend, nuff said
😂 this kinda crazy 🤣
He's not a good doctor , he's an affordable doctor 😂
"Mad" mags ... make you wish you had saved every copy that you ever came across!!
God, I love this guy ❤
Straight up and honest, Conan O'Brien always kinda weirded me out ... this came out of left field, and my opinion has changed 100%!!  😂🤪😁 Totally the best kinda weird!!
He is red as lobster but still denying it 😁
The "Whats gonna happen? " bit he did is so clever, childlike and absolutely hilarious.
Conan really woke up HIM
This was gold
Dear mother of God conan is a legend we didnt know we needed
Funniest ducking episode ever 😂😂😂😂😂😂 ty hot ones and Conan.
Always loved Conan. Grats on getting him on the show!
Conan is a masterpiece, everything he does is calculated. He is a comical genius and makes me smile every time he does a skit or an interview. Thank you, Conan.
Gotta be one of the best
We should all be so proud of this Irish man who never tasted a spice. He’s held it together so well! Didn’t even feel it
This is one of the really, really rare moments, where I honestly whish I could press thumbs up twice.
Invite Conan on a hot ones special with ChilliClaus!!!
His eyes are as bloodshot and red as his face at the end.
this is the kind of whole body commitment that I would expect from Conan O'Brien.
Wow. I watched Hugh Jackman cry like a baby at number 5 on this show, and Conan O'Brien comes on like a total boss. Outstanding!
this just goes to show that real comedy does not need a laugh track to tell people when to laugh
And what he do
I spent so long trying to find this vid, I knew it was out there, but I thought his name was brian o'conan 😭😭😭  I'm glad I'm here now tho
Conan you are a GOAT
By far my favourite hotones episode
I mean it's a scientifically proven fact that redheads have higher pain tolerance
Conan made a friend forever with Sean. Game recognizings game
Conan said "I dare you to try and upstage me" and then DELIVERED
Conan may have ended up in the ER after, but as he said, You have to dedicate to the bit!! He 1000% dedicated to the bit!!!
I absolutely love Conan.. I've been watching him since 93--94. One of my first jobs was the overnight shift at Walmart unloading tractor trailers.. our first break of the shift was when Late night would come on and I would always make sure I got to the break room first and put the TV on Conan to catch the monolog..  It's hard to wrap my head around the fact that "in the year 2000" was so long ago way before the year 2000!  Now here we are in 2024 almost 2025..  I am still a huge fan and watch everything that is put out.. Conan has been one of the most significant highlights of entertainment before the term "text message" or "selfie" was even a thought..   I hope he is here for many years to come!!!
None of his jokes hit at all lbs
Jesus Christ, that was insane!
I honestly want to subscribe to MAX just to watch Conan’s show 😂
CONAN IS A CRAZY MANIAC THAT’S FOR SURE 😂😂😂😂
The water buffalo story is so funny 😂😂😂
How is this six months ago.... It happened like a week ago.
Conan went savage, This was awesome to watch
Love the guests - can't stand the host. So fake beyond every level. From the faking he eats the wings with the same sauce, to the empty lifeless soul asking cliche questions. I hope someone makes a similar channel and blows this channel over.
Man is national treasure 😁😄
That was wild!!! Conan O’Brien owns his legendary status like a boss!!!!
miss conan show!
F it's 3 in the morning and i can hold my laughter ✌🏻😁🤣👏🏻🙏🏻
Conan is a true barbarian ♥
Rip to nice blue outfit or opportunity for auction item?
16:55 that dude made love to that wing
I have to know why he is putting it in his pocket. He’s so silly it’s just so odd I love it.
Conan has always said he would do anything for a laugh and I somewhat thought he was joking. Although I found it funny I felt a little sad because I realized he really will do ANYTHING for a laugh.😕
Best. Hot Ones.  EVER!!
That denim shirt Conan has is drip need one for myself
WORST episode that exists. I guess he thought it was funny, but...
I was planning on binging some more Hot Ones episodes tonight, but after that masterpiece of a episode, I don’t think I can. It’s just not gunna get any better than that. This is the new gold standard for Hot Ones guests. How can someone possibly top that?
It’s him… THE hot one.
"hot pockets" I think I get it now. Thanks, Conan!
The 🐐   Simply put. He drank Da 💣, snatched Victory from the jaws of Victory and spit in the mouth of calamity.   The 🐐
6:53 3 years 11 months 😭😭😂😂😂😂
what a legend i totally adore conan, the one and only real person and talk show host out there
I never liked Conan O'Brien. But he gained my respect. That dedication is on another level.
Legendary commitment to the bit
Oh amazing!!! Definitely one of the best episodes 🙌 😂❤
Well done  Conan 👏 👏👏 I bet his colon was bleeding after this! 😂
He always gives his 101%.
Watching this again 6 months later. 🤣
dude always has it on point lol
When Conan compliments Sean's interviewing skills, man. Such high praise(and deserved, Sean is great) from someone who has worked as a talk show host for so long. I can imagine Sean got goosebumps in that moment.  Probably my favorite Hot Ones episode.
I died watching this 💀🔥🤣 Conan is my all time favorite
I don't think Conan has taste buds!
GOATED.
Had no clue about Warren g Harding ?!
Best one ever
I rewatch clueless gamer all the time
SAVAGE...
By far the best hot ones
Red heads genetically have a higher pain threshold. Fact. 😂
We ne3d more coco
Team coco por vida ese
This is the absolute best Hot Ones episode in existence!
I haven’t laughed so hard at 4am
Amazing!
I don't find this guy normally funny but once he hit Da Bomb wing I lost it 😂😂😂😂😂 .. So unhinged!!!
Also Conan is right. HBO changing its streaming name to Max is so dumb. It’s awful. How about calling it HBO. Just HBO
That is hands down the funniest episode of the show.  I'm crying as much as Conan, but mine is from laughter..
Let me know when another guest comes close to taking over the show like Conan did and putting on a free clinic
Great way to empty your stomach later 😅😅
eww. i couldnt watch by the end. so efffing grosss. ruined it with the whole spit thing
Conan Is drooling
This  is the  Matrix..
What a savage😮
Oh man that hurt to watch.. accomplishment achieved Conan! You are amazing!
Mr Tries Too Hard Command Performance. Bravi
He’s wearing the same jacket as bill burr
Ok boomer
Now lets play MTG]
The comedy equivalent of that scene in wolverine and deadpool
Had to come back and re-watch the Conan episode to wash off the DJ Khaled episode.
Ive watched this twice..... That has never happened 😂  Hot ones is long for YouTube, but there wasn't one boring moment in this interview ❤
Conan your the man..❤😅
can someone give me a timestamp where he causally drinks from the sauce?
HE IS NUTS!!!!!!
Conan is the very definition of "never meet your hero" to Sean. But in a good and comedic way.
MASTER!
There will never be a better episode. Now I am done watching the show 🔥
He could have ruined the show being so loud and full of absolute nonsense, but he owned it. He talked the talk and the walked the walk!
Conan is the mannnn yes legend
My respects, on all matters.
Conan legend comedian
Best guest by far
Keep in mind that MANY past guests have become incoherent halfway through the lineup and ended up tapping out. Yes, Conan has the redhead genes that give him curious powers of resistance to chemical substances... but this was still pure Mind Over Matter. He IS Conan the Destroyer!!! ⚔️🌶️✊🏽
nobody will beat this episode.
This is the first and only episode where Sean is like a deer in headlights and just can’t keep up. He usually likes to mimic how the guests eat their wings but there is was no way that was happening due to Conan’s comedy gold.
those who know, know. conan always been the goat!
It would have been great to see Jordan Schlansky on here covering the history of buffalo wings and dictating the misconception that these are wings of buffalo (which are actually called bison), which are the both the singular and plural term.  {continue Jordan rant for the full session while not eating any wings}
mind over matter.
Its kind of disappointing that this episode isnt even in the top 50 most viewed. Like how?! Ill blame the demographics,  I assume the majority who watch this show are too young to know about Conan. SMH
Mans pocketed the bones 😭
Best guest ever!!!
Holy incredible
Legendary episode
Sean had control over neither the show nor his laughter. This episode is incredible.
Love the show. Love Conan.  This should have been the show finally as it will be absolutely impossible to beat his performance.
Conan is a pure savage. 😂
كونان هو الذي  ادار الحلقه بنفس الأداء المسرحي المعروف عنه  ، هذي النوعيه لم تعد متوفره في زمن جيمي كيميل و جيمي فالن
Conan turned water into milk 🙏
Conan is a performer to his core. What a performance, that will go down in history as one of the best ever. 👏 👏 👏
Hands down to you Conan! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
I was really impressed how much he knew about Warren G Harding!!
He is so annoying, so fake…just stop.
Easily the best episode ever
He's a psychopath 🤣🤣 dude had to have taken something good before this!!!
First this and now the Harrison Ford episode, Conan is on fire this year
conan killed it
That Conan is a awesome funny dude😅
Dude, does he have Covid dead tastebuds?
Medhurst Trafficway
I’m sweating watching….literally
Is this what insanity looks like? 🤣
You finish this with Ice Cream, then the next day while ON the TOILET, You scream, COME ON ICE CREAM!!!!!!!
This is my favorite hot ones episode ever
Hamill Mountains
one of the funniest men of all time
Best hot ones guest ever.
Conan living up to his namesake here. Pocketing chicken bones is unhinged.
😂😂😂😂 my type of humor
😂
What a national treasure!!!
Did they use a spatula to do Conan's makeup?
LEGENDARY
This was brilliant, I never laughed so much 😂.. loved it!! Conan your the bomb !!
Sean looked concerned at the end after Conan drank the last dab 😂
The doctor part got me so good
Coco with a monologue for the ages, truly the GOAT
Best. Episode. Ever.   Conan is a genius!
Conan"s face turning red, his lip's are swollen and he kept at it!  Whoa I laughed till I cracked a rib. Great episode Sean, thanks for getting Conan on, epic! Conan get yourself to the ER asap come on,  we love and need you buddy. Cheers from Hong Kong!
Alene Inlet
I just love Conan. He can be so over the top silly but manage to answer every question seriously aswell.
LEGEND
Hey i know i watch this too many times now,  do we have a behind the scenes or bloopers on this Conan O'Brien episode?
For a moment, I thought I was watching Donald Trump rambling after Conan took on Da Bomb.  Then he transcended to a state of enlightenment of post-nut clarity.
Conan is so brilliant I almost feel sorry for him. Can he ever not be funny? Is it like the Midas touch of comedy?
Biblically Accurate Depiction Of Lost In The Sauce
This has been my all time fave in hot ones….nothing can beat Conan and this episode definitely is hard to beat…
Only man to out do Sean. Conan is the best. #1 of all time. No one compares to Conan.
What a legend
When I saw him with Da Bomb I was Shawn.
This was so cringey and I feel second hand embarrassed for everyone involved that had to witness this
22:59 I'M FINE   *literally dying*
Words cannot explain how much I adore Conan O'brien ❤
The old ushering in the new
What. A. Beast!!!!
I'm 6 months late to the party, watching this at 4:13am and I am laughing uncontrollably.   ∞/10
Conan’s hair is iconic
This is the only episode I’ve actually watched through 😂
noone alive has heard lincoln's voice
hands down the best episode ever

OH. MY. GOD. Conan rules the hot sauce world. While I love a great hot sauce (and wings), there is no way i could do what he's now done. My hot sauce hat off to you Conan!
The belly laughs I received from watching this were very healing and energizing. Thank you, Gratitude and Love <3 !
Sean has had alot of great guests, but I hope he knows how lucky he was to have this LEGEND.
That was the best hot ones episode!!!!!!!!!!!
And this is why ladies and gentlemen, conan is the GOAT
He haaaaaaaaaas to have some mexican roots somefknhow!
I bet Conan used something like GBL to numb his pallete, and make him immune to the hot sauce. I was addicted to the stuff for a while in college, and it destroyed my teeth. But it would be very handy for something like this.
Beautiful....just Beautiful 😍 🤩 👌
“You cant stop me from being who I am. To quote Popeye, ‘I yam what I yam” god I love this freak
This might have been the best episode they've ever done. Never before has a guest completely taken over the episode quite like this. Conan is 1 in 8 billion.
did Jim Carrey do Hot Ones ? only he can top that, but coming after Conan might make that disingenuous
No one in the comments mentions it but I love how he instantly said "Nixon" at 17:55 when Sean asked him which US president would make a great guest on his podcast. The man didn't even hesitate as if he'd been waiting for someone to ask him that for ages
Doctor Arroyo put his stethoscope in Sean's mouth :D
Legend
I love this episode sooo much
Amazing, how he can take that pain and turn into comedy, 👏🏽👏🏽
It being October right now I've been watching scary movies again hoping to find something truly disturbing or creepy.. This has beaten all of them so far...
When i read this, i heard it in my head in his voice 😂 totally matched! Great story
I liked this episode— but I just couldn’t enjoy it as much because the music was too loud. And Conan is entertaining on his  own— so actually the music was kind of trying to overtake the vibe of the video…like some action film…but it’s the Conan man…eating hot ones
The most crazy 4ever Canon 😂👌
This episode will never be beaten 😂😂😂😂😂
My boy Conan is the GOAT
Fantastic in every way! The great host Sean hosting the equally great host Conan. And Conan proves how far he is willing to go to make even someone else's show great, while delivering interesting and relevant answers. Pure gold!
I love you Conan O’Brien
Legend
I seriously doubt the guests in this show actually eat the hottest stuff.  It’s just a show
This one is indeed the the best
😂😂😂😂 greatest of all time! So much effort  to “stay relevant”  He’s my hero
"Call the wife!" 🤣🤣🤣
Conan mentioned this, but I have to second: Way beyond the fun of the premise (eating hot stuff & reacting), Sean is truly a great interviewer.
I'm late to the party but these two is absolutely amagend😊😊😊
If Conan is on it I'm watching it.
God I forgot how funny Conan is 😅 I'm so glad he's still creating
😂
When the video ended, I stood up and applauded because Conan deserves a standing ovation. 🤯🤯 For real tho... Conan might be the best American showman in history, the guy is a living legend, even outside the US, so few american entertainers have achieved that.
easily the best hot ones episode. god my cheeks hurt i was laughing so hard! never change conan never change.
That is a peak of masculinity
Nobody better than Conan.  A great comic, and an even better person.  Love him!
Conan vs DJ Khalid exemplifies who-who
Conan is mexican 😅😅😅
I have never loved Conan more. This was genius.
That ending had me gasping for air.
First wing: Oh no, that was a bit of a wimpy bite surely Conan isn't going to be a let down after waiting so long? By the end: Oh god, someone get that man a doctor. No I mean an ACTUAL doctor.
21:09 A Ubisoft employee travelled back in time to deliver this sound bite as part of Rayman's stage-clear theme. YEAAAAH!!!
this is all time interview. Mount everest
God, I love Conan.
Conan giving a master class in comedy.
Yeah you wouldn't want anybody else eating on those wings no wonder why it took them with him. Just look closer
Conan is a arrogant hack
Ill preface this by saying im not a big TV or movie person... But real talk, i didnt really give Conan a proper chance   and thought I wasnt a fan of his until now. Love this show. Also, i am 38 so not a young newbie to the world either 😂
How to make a red man redder.
Dewitt View
i was in the conan camp for the tonight show. it’s occurred to me that sean has johnny’s class.
Conan is the G.O.A.T.
His eyes about the color of his hair by the end ...
Made me laugh ^-^
Honestly the best episode yet
This is the most funniest episode after Gordon Ramsey. Brilliant show. F off to all guest nibbling on the wings and being all scared, it’s all or nothing 😅 Hats off to you Conan O’Brian
legend
LEGENDARY !!!
13:34 these bits with the “DR” are pure genius
You want a show, I will give you one!
The mess he makes the whole time, the pocket wings, the doctor without a degree, this is just classic Conan gold.
This is easy top 3 of all time.
Top that!
He picked up water and in the next frame, he's holding milk. Hilarious. Yes, he's feeling it.  This is like the episode of Chappelle Show when Joe Rogan is holding Fear Factor with Tyrone Biggums, and Tyrone doesn't care at all about what he's eating.
Love this one.  Conan has always been the perfect host, and the perfect guest!  Great Work everyone.  First we feast, Team Coco, classic episode has been born.
Bro is our real life Joker. No one could have predicted he'd dominate the show like this. What a mad lad! I love him! :D
Conan is Beyond Insanity, not Da Bomb
Pure Gold! Conan O'Brien will forever be my favorite talk show host/Comedian!
Best one of the series for shooooore
11 million views and Conan is a Harvard graduate it shows how intelligent he is and his best quality other then being very funny is the fact that he cares about people especially his staff. He paid everyone on his dime during covid while leno gave 200$
Easily the best episode
21:00 Face on 🔥 📛 👩‍🚒 🚒 🧯
this was disgusting... I love it
First time watching these and Conan is right he is a very good interviewer! Ps I love Conan!
He didn't even flinch
The red hair gene controlled by MC1R gene, which alters pain receptors as well in conjunction with TRPV1 gene / receptor. The hot pepper component capacin activates pain receptors, why it geels "hot". It is not a taste bud taste. So likely Conan has a high tolerance for hot sauce. Which is weird because he is right the Irish (and English) of Boston and New England have the blandest of food.  It probably means he needs more anesthesia, or he is wzking up mid surgery...  Its weird as some red heads are more sensitive than usual...
What!?! The hype undersold
Conan and Jim Carrey might be the only two people I'd ever say were born to bless us with laughter
4:34 hi. I’m Nicole hockey from sandy hook promise. I know this is hard to hear but on December 19th, a gunman broke into an elementary school and murdered my child.
I wonder this is what Micheal Scott would have done when he was in conans spot
I want to be him when i was asked what would I do if there's an end of the world and i had an 20 mins fo live
I wonder what that night had
Nah chugging a hot sauce bottle  is crazyyyyyyy
This is the most unhinged episode of Hot Ones and I include Eric Andre
Respect
just a legend
Best episode EVER!!!!!!!
Conan,s speach made me think off the speach from Charlie Chaplin
Mandy Port
Lehner Vista
This might just be the best episode of Hot Ones to ever exist, unless they bring Nardwuar which then proceeds to Sean and Nardy going back to back to back questioning each other with great amount of research knowledge.
I would LOVE to see jordan shlansky on here.

RIP Conan O'Brien 1935-2024

After watching this, I am pretty sure that this man has reached godhood
I will be absolutely distraught when Conan leaves this Earth
WOW! Savage + Legend
hands down the best episode ever. What a legend Conan!! inspiring talk at the end too. Love this guy
Long live Conan O'Brien. What a legend.
this guy is just a legend!
Naaaa this episode made me cry laughing Conan was incredible
This is the best episode of Hot Ones I’ve ever seen so far. Conan is literally a comedic genius of many different styles, quick witted, well read, and completely engaging with the audience. His comment about finding comedy from anywhere just shows he’s a true disciple of the craft.
I looked it up. The water buffalo thing actually happened.
I now fear Connan
How do you stay in character the whole time. Those hot sauce ain't a joke.
Was his temp really up 2 degrees?
Was his temp really up?
The ending dialogue! I'm dead!!! 😂😅🤣💀🪦
Conan is the GOAT. Who else could bring his prop man and pull it like that ?  😅 I'm wheezing here watching this show 😭💀 Nothing but love for Conan. Thanks for bringing him to us Sean!
You mess with the bull you get the horns Sean!!!!!!!!!!!
🫡🫡🫡
Sean bring back conan and make another video but with jordan schlansky
We need Jordan Schlansky on this show for various reasons and tasks
You should watch the Dr. Arroyo podcast with Conan and Sona
Rempel Via
One of the greatest!
Always loved Conan! This guy really amazes me
Conan must have played minecraft coz that so minecraft thing stuffing chicken in the pocket xD
Hailee Fork
Imagine burning _this guy_ for Jay Leno.
Jedidiah Ferry
I am intimidated
"Read High and low , don't lock yourself into the last ten years " unbelievable ! all from the high of hot sauce, it was like listening to Lou Gehrig's Farwell , I almost choked up , ok that's a little much, I know , but you get the Idea ,  great skit , upps , i mean great show 🤣🤣
Conan literally shat on every single past person who did the show. Legend.
1. Conan O’Brian sounded like Master Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  2. Remember that one episode of Yu-Gi-oh! GX where they censored sake into hot sauce?
I was on the edge of my seat during this episode and I'm not even sure why :D This is true showmanship! Conan is just such a master at what he does!!
I just wish Conan could learn to loosen up a little
Is Sean a very small man, or is Conan a very large man? I can't tell, but one of those is true.

What a legend 🎉
I only came here to listen to a mad man tell me to read the Bible because it's funny.
Master class on hosting, staying on task and being hilarious
😮😮😮😮😮😮😊😅😅😅
This set the standard for Hot Wings.
molly goes well with pepper souce i suppose
Mind if I keep these? Bones in the pocket is such a perfect Conan gag. This whole thing was so chaotically absurd and hilarious
Conan single handedly carried the show
You're not a doctor are you? 😂😂😂😂😂
Maudie Estates
He didn't need the "from being who I am." He could have just said "you can't stop me". Would still have been true
I absolutely love Conan
Is that gonna be Conan’s new show? Conan O’Brien needs a Doctor?
Please invite jr NTR from tollywood to your show....
Whats wrong with me why cant i feel it!
Dr arroyo.. hes not the best, but hes very affordable
Absolute fricking legend that man :D
Ondricka Heights

How does the Daffy Duck episode have more views than this?!
Good to see Sean on Conan O'Brien needs a friend😂😂
He never broke that fourth wall.  This guy is like for the SHOW BiZ of it all! I'm amazed
can't request help raising money to help pay for wife's cancer treatments and getting her Visa from Philippines in which I been working on over 9.5 years!!! wow
help my wife get here from Philippines? tried for 9.5 years now legally. I'm a Marine veteran and truck driver. they now are saying $3500 more to redo same documents over & I can get Visa after I have nothing LEFT... my wife has cancer and is only 37!!! Cancer gets ALL my money...
Dan Bongino show blocks content they don't like! They blocked my ability to request help for fighting my wife's cancer and trying to get her here from Philippines. been trying over 9.5 years now
ACLJ  show blocks content they don't like! They blocked my ability to request help for fighting my wife's cancer and trying to get her here from Philippines. been trying over 9.5 years now
Oh my God! This is hard to watch!!!  💀😂😭 what a show!!!
Conan have probably the best comedy type for this 😂

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sean definitely met his match and man conan definitely took those wings like a champ!!
One of the best episodes ever
Interesting combo. Howard Stern famously said Conan was his favorite interview (which is saying something). And Sean Evans is known to take excellent interviews. This interview hasss to be amazing (ive just started watching it).
You can clearly make this as a season or show ender.
Halvorson Vista
turns out he had 3 teeth removed and the novacaine had worn off yet
Id like to think I've seen about 85% of these, and this is the best one. By far.
Munan O'Brien
I freaking love him just as much as I love Dave Chapelle
This man lives off propaganda
Danielle Meadows
Schmitt Prairie
This guy is a straight up gangster 😂  How he just started chugging down the hot sauce. Easily one of the if not the best episode yet.
Timmy!!!!!
Best Episode Ever! 😂
Only thing missing from this episode was a marching band
Conan goated
The doctor is really "SUS" 😁😁..
Bergnaum Island
Love Conan, but that looked pretty gross
I’m seriously impressed!!!!
Hermiston Mill
i've gotta steal "i like to announce my mistakes up front"
I... did not see that coming....
Hahahahahahahahahahaa
God Bless Conan for still remembering the camera man's name!
Love Conan. He's different than most comedians
I love the complete opposite of Conan and Gordon! xD
God, Conan is literally the Joker in real life.
Hands down best hot ones ever.
Conan is the greatest of all time.
Why is noone talking about conan riding a water buffalo. Thats wild af
This whole interview feels like an acid trip[
I am not going to lie, I’ve watched the hot ones for several years now, watched Conan even longer, I don’t know why but I teared a little because I think nobody will ever be as phenomenal as Conan ever.
Conan is Boss 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gutkowski Drive
The King of late night and last of the Old Guard.  Its a shame the next generation of late night is so awful in comparison.  We love you Conan.
Fay Lane
“Call the wife” 😂
Conan Was The Best 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😗😗😗🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Dr. Arroyo? Dr. Ditch?
Conan is nucking futs!
Conan is nucking futs!
This is a masterpiece 😂
Wow! He was wild!
Perfection. As always. Conan💜 PS~My 18 year old is reading Don Quixote.😅
Guy’s a beast!
My eys are watering for Conan. I bet his colon was burnt numb for a week.
That was by far the funniest hot ones I've seen
Please get John Stewart on the show.
This interview had it all, great information and deep dive on the history of Conan as a talk show host, amazing entertainment and a stellar promotion of his upcoming show
The final bottle, Conan just saw God.
The only red head man I will ever truly respect.
Always Conan’s fan! ❤!
This is how i have tried to live. And it's not sustainable for me.
When they say astrology is fake...yet Aries acting like this.
I heard Conan was declared dead for 3 minutes after this episode.
Fantastic aeason finale, but no question about his best friend and favorite guest Norm McDonald? Or his former Team Coco / Conan Show producer Jordan Schlansky?
That's the most Robin Williams I have seen since Robin Williams passed away.
The ultimate slapstick.
Conan is a god reincarnated, he’s true he’s genuine
It’s officially confirmed that Conan is the new Spice God..
That was pure brilliance.
Samanta River
Conan is King
Canon is an alien 😂
Conan you don't know what your getting yourself into.
Only conan can make you forget whose show it is😂😂
Muller Forge
W⚓️
*conan ferociously devouring wing”  “You say this is pure pepper?!”
The best episode hands down. Too much too good!
COB was funny to the point where you could follow the track of my tears.
This is why hes a legend  They do not make them like that anymore
Conan is a beast!
Just tried a green tomato/ jalapeno sauce. Salontro and garlic 2❤
This is the best hot ones episode of all time, I don't care what anyone says.
All those bottles turned over at the end.  LOL
23:00 😂😂😂😂
Perfect example of how Moms and Dads don't make us old fellas and lasses as hard and crazy as they used to! Mr. Conan this is The perfect example, of why my children are scared of their parents showing them how we do fun!!! Well Done Sir Well done!!! My question to you Mr. Evans, do you see any difference between the younger generation and older generations holding it together?
“Call the wife!” 😂
Conan's slapstick routine bites.
I just watched this again and conan is one of the greatest human beings on earth
CONAN O'BRIEN IS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME!!!
Canon-  Doctor he is not the best, He is affordable
Although I agree with many of the political positions that said presenters take, it bores me to death when they preach about their (the broadcaster's) moral views. ...Every. Single. Show. It's just not funny AND it's full on preaching to the choir. As for the attempt to pass as propaganda, it's honestly not even effective enough to be justified. I'd rather see them do what they are overpaid to do: COMEDY!!!
Mandy Rapids
Senger Extensions
This is really wild. Salud
Idk how people like this guy ,hes so annoying.
Love that there wasn't even a question for that second to last wing
wauw i wa snot expecting this from conan,absolutly crushed it,dude is releantless
Conan has the best late night show of his era.
Conan O'Brien 🏆🏆🏆
The first time I've ever seen Sean totally eclipsed on his own show. That was absolutely epic. He didn't even try to match Conan.
Conan O'Brien and Craig Ferguson are the only REAL talk-show host that deserve all of the credits for building such a great universe for people all other the world! You got to love them for their REAL AND HONEST way of doing this for so long!
I grew up watching his late night as a kid. He's the best. Like he really is a master at being a showman.
That was chaotic and I loved it
There will never be a better Hot Ones interview. This was brilliant!
is conan grew up in a irish catholic house, there would be a bunch of flavour in the food, could say its due to the catholic but its not i grew up in a scottish catholic house, food was amazing.. better than any restaraunt could do
what would his toilet have looked like after
Conan is funny af!
OK OK I think my bucket list is going to include me dressing up as a Viking or some type of Norwegian warrior good grief and that is so good
Well done Conan! Sloppy eater, but could handle himself well.
Everyday I keep wondering why oh WHY is Conan off the air and the other extremely scripted and non funny hosts are still doing talkshows. This guy was always genuinely funny, interested in people and doing funny skits. Like they did with Henry Cavill. He was the perfect Witcher and Superman. He's available, why would you go for a lesser one instead?
I want to challenge him to hot wing contest.
Conan Da’Bombarian
The real life Dr. Nick
I've watched many of these shows.   1. Conan O'Brien's performance was the most hilarious and unique 2. He took those wings and sauces like a beast. 3. Comedy genius from start to end..."Are you a doctor?"  "I should be."
Conan is unhinged! 🤣
Anyone else was on the edge of their seat,  anxious he would touch his eyes??? Nobody was warning him while he soaked his hands in eye-acid.   Later in the bathroom might have been his moment of regret,  in a couple different ways 😅
I lost it when the camera randomly focused on the spilled hot sauce bottles while Conan was on his manic episode
Tears snot and drool dear lord absolute unit.  I hope he survived.
Is there supposed to be a link between lower pain tolerance and redheads? Higher sensitivity to cold and heat as well?! Meaning that this would be more painful for him. Or am I misremembering that
Unlikely that anyone can top it anytime soon.
This is the best episode hands down.
Sean is so hot
Conan's disgusting!
best guest ever
Conan might actually be insane. This is unhinged behavior
By far the best interview
Veum Skyway
Conan managed to do well, i cant believe itt
7:07 When you start a weekend with the boys 24:57 How it's going so far
Conan o'brien aka Snoop Dogg and JB Smoove 's Girlfriend 😂😂😂
I don't remember the last time I was glued to the screen not believing what I was seeing like this. Did not see it comin', what a true legend.
We need Conan as a guest host just for some episodes... This dude aura is just unbeatable. The Greatest Showman!
Conan makes the last dab more like the last half  bottle, lol
Conan is life, man must flow
Conan the wings of death destroyer! Of all the people I have seen on this show Conan has made me laugh the hardest.
21:22 CaLl ThE wIfE!
Jesus Christ who knew Conan could be this wide open?!😂🎉
Dude's eyes watering, acts like it's nothing to him, love it!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂I love Conan!!!!
It's low hanging fruit for him. I could see it coming from a mile away. It's funny but not some milestone of the show. Getting all gross was an easy out. I don't know. Ive seen that explosive Conan humor a million times. It's not fresh.
I don't find this as incredible as so many do. 8 find it rather low hanging fruit.
I had no idea O'Brien was this much of a freak. Dude is a legend. I loved this.
"what's wrong with me? why can't i _feel?!"_ 😭😭😭
This was the funniest episode I have watched 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I am crying
Dr Arroyo is the best lol
Legend 🎉 Coco gogo! ❤
Conan is king
The Man is an honest to God lunatic!!!
The Original “content creator”
3:30 as a max I can definitely say, it confuses me and feels a bit more personal than I would like
The strongest guest was Conan and the weakest guest was DJ Khaled. Who would've guessed.
His over the top grossness is not funny.
And just like that, this became my favourite interview from hot ones
We got it... his team does good research and gives him good questions to ask.. is ok. no need to mention it every time. Love Conan
"Where did you go to medical school?"  "In 1998"......  ".......where?..."  Lol
lol Conan is the funniest out of all the late night comedians
Conan almost made Sean tap out.
is this real??or fake?canot be posible
Bridget Motorway
The comedy master and mega host conan is on spice!!
King Route
I love this man Gen X hero.
Lol why does he look like the mad hatter from alice in wonderland here
Conan O'Brien telling you are a very good interviewer is the peak compliment for those ones.
Wingdrop!!!
The vid of the bruise is on youtube bro, its amazing
What a guy Conan Is😂Really good and Entertaining video😂🔥
Connan is the best 😂
The undisputed goat
It's no wonder a talkshow host knows how to be an entertaining "guest". But that's just putting it lightly... Conan is the *ONLY* talkshow host that I'd ever watch willingly. He's an amazing entertainer, and an amazing human outside of the camera spotlight.  I'm sure Sean's over the moon when Conan said he was a great interviewer.
Bring Jordan Schlansky please.
One of the best performances ever. So gangster. Comedic genius.
This is the Batman vs Superman of Talk Shows!
Conan calling you "a great motherf***ing host" most feel sooooo good
Conan  has always been my favorite late night host. To this day if I hear anybody talk about the 2000s in my head I'm hearing "in the year 2000". Lol
Conan is and with always be our greatest
I’ve probably watched this episode at least 15 times. I still burst out laughing every time.
IM FINE IM PERFECTLY FINE. best hot ones ever from a comedy legend
LEGENDARY ❤❤❤❤.. DR..?
Conan become the sauce at this point
Conan is a BEAST!
It didn't take much to get some much needed color to that pale face of his!
Best episode to date! Conan had me rolling with laughter! He will endure extreme pain for a laugh at any age! Love you Conan! Thanks for 20 plus years of laughs!
Conan is a G bruh
conan must be uncontrolable when intoxicated on parties xD
Conan turned into Rick Sanchez😂!
Conan rules
This was one of my favorite… Please have MatPat Next. Hollywood celebrities are fine… but if you can have Daffy duck on your show, you can have MatPat. I’ve been a fan since the beginning.
Conan giving off Chris Farley energy, & we’re here for it!!
The best❤
CALL THE WIFE
❤❤❤❤❤
The unfunniest tries too hard person on the planet. NO LIKEY HIM
This is going to go down as one of if not THE best episodes of Hot Ones in history
Please tell me the doctor is a paid actor, otherwise…
I feel like Conan turned into master shake there at the end lol
This is art
The man eats Lettermans and Lenos on bread every morning.
how old is he now?
Imagine getting high as a kite and totally legal.. 🪁
That was the greatest thing I've ever seen.
Plot twist Conan borrowed his friends coat for the Hot Ones podcast and hes giving it back with wing bones in the pockets.
For me this was so over the top and absurd that it is unwatchable.
A fake doctor at the interview brilliant. Conan is a comedy genius
This was insane . Conan chaos . Respect 👊
“The other guy, I don’t know who he was”. PERFECT subtle shot at Leno.
yeah i need a new conan special asap
I love Conan, he's a genuinely funny guy, it feels like it comes natural to him.
Somebody need to keep an eye on him
I wonder if its because of that middle eastern bean that numbs your senses particularly taste.
After the doctor bit, I think that sauce he drank wasn’t actually hot sauce lol but if it was real, wow 😂
So Conan WON Hot Ones. Like I didn't know it was a competition... But that being said... He WON WON! 💪🏾🙏🏾🙌🏾💪🏾
Conan the barbarian.
Straight beast.
핵불닭볶음면으로 해주세요
I am the world’s biggest Conan O’Brien fan, but I’m hoping that the dudes that came to put him in a rubber room where wearing gloves!!!
Conan just rocks
13:08
I love Conan ❤
One of the best episodes! Conan is the bomb!
“I’m an Irish- Catholic from Boston, I don’t know what spicy is.” Brilliant!
This man is insane and hilarious and insane 😭
He never once even said "Um" - bruh can speak like no other
they were right, surprises where you least expect it.
Legend. Being told by Conan that you're a great talk show host has to have sent Sean's soul out of his body (in a good way). Though, I really do think Sean is a great host, and Conan is just recognizing his likeminded willingness to put himself out there on the line with his guest.
Sean and all of the viewers at home letting out a collective "Oh my god" as Conan poured da bomb all over his wing.
My son's friend has a condition where she is not affected by hot, spicy food.    I've seen her dip her pizza in Da Bomb sauce.  She can still taste the flavor of the food but she doesn't feel the heat or feels very little of it. Weird.
KIIIIILLED IT!! 😂😂
He is the goat of late late night. And really a missed person day to day.
Donald Duck was on Hot Ones 4 months after this yet is less over the top than Conan.
I wonder if 6:24 flew over the head of most? "The other guy" - we all should know who he means by this. He who must not be named around Conan, but this is who he was meaning - you know who I mean. The man who took the Tonight Show from him in 2010.
Where can we watch Conan's new show here in the UK? We do not have HBO here in the UK
Hahahaha
Conan looks like one of those bad guy bosses in a movie
Conan, as I know 100% you read these comments even now. Just want to say thanks for all your years past and all those to come! You're different but you're our different! o7
Conan's the best
both bill burr and conan obrien are boston redheads and they both wore jean jackets to the show
Yo, I've been binge watching these, and Conan is the most gangsta I've seen. Respect.
I've been marathoning the show and Conan did the best! Hands down! What a champ!
Conan GOAT
What an absolute legend
Conan... are you still alive?
Best guest of all time! Rock On Conan!
“I don’t fear your wings, man.”  😂😭
Just think of what The Tonight Show could have been had he continued to host it...
The little ceasars of doctors
This is how I imagine the demonic invasion in Doom
Salute!!
Bring back conan, this time have him eat chicken wings with jordan schlansky
Arguable Best episode I’ve seen
Like a boss' boss
I was into Conan before it was cool.
How is Conan still the funniest guy alive?
Do you think he put the chicken in his pockets so they couldn’t use his DNA at a crime scene
its the greatest hot ones
Conan is one in a million 😂
That's the compliment you want to hear from probably the greatest late night TV interviewer to ever do it.
Conan is one of the few celebrities who has never changed, always been funny, and can be genuine and honest amidst his comedy!
This man is on another comedic galaxy from Joe Rogan and the bro gang
Dr. Arroyo breaking character to give Conan's temp reading thank you king
This just made me like Conan even more lol
do any of you think this is staged?
what's up with talk show hosts always interrupting people when they talk 😂
I regret not seeing God this early
The hot sauce could not handle Conan
Worse man on tv btw and supposed to be a writer of the future. I do respect the man for being himself though
That ending reminds me of Rick Sanchez
beast mode on
The grinch did his hair ✨✨💯✅
Why the weird music choice in the background?
I think there is no late night talk show host that has the mindset Conan speaks about at 11:50 -12:15
Savage. Like Ariana was.😂
That gave me all the funny and what it is like to be a pure human and express emotion. Freaking Hilarious 😂😂😂 The Goat
22:37 I'm sorry, I just love the look of genuinely deep concern on Sean's face.
I have no words.
Conan would be the richest guy in Dune.
Conan drank hot candle wax before this show. The only explanation 😂😂
What a HOT ONES LEGEND!!!!
L E G E N D.
“What’s the point of this.”
I bet Conan's a-hole burned like a mf the next day hahaha
Comedy Gold!!!
Never realized how much Conan and Nathan Lane sound alike when they get past a certain decibel.
I love how he can keep a straight face while putting the bones in his pocket. It’s like he actually is going to sell them or something
now i would like jim carrey for some reason
My Goodness. The most interesting episode. For someone who has never eating spicy till 50. This man has definitely been through a lot 😅
F’n Champ!
Legend
Please get Kamala Harris and Tim Walz!!!
He was really burning at the end there.
This might be the best episode ever
This is the first Hot Ones episode I've seen where Sean looked genuinely terrified of his guest 🤣
I really wanted to do hot ones for a long time cause I knew I could do better than anyone else until I watched this now there is no point because I can outdo your showmanship Conan I tip my hat to you sir
GOAT
even sean looked worried for him
"What's wrong with me?!? Why can't I FEEL?!?!?
Best episode ever!😅
Conan O’Brien is the absolute goat
So conan is the new spice king now?
He turned someone else's show into his own skit with Dr Arroyo. The man is a comedy legend.
Well, Conan takes the World Heavyweight Hot Wings Title, and I don't see how anyone could top this.
❤
I want to go on this show and eat these wings and see how hot they are ..
We need a reapearance with conan and Jordan schlansky.
Best guest ever
What a G
The funniest 😂😂😂
Call the wife !!
Absolute legend !!! lol 😅😂
Unreal. What a legend. Best episode I've seen
Conan is a robot
I think he misses his show
Sean should be proud of himself, getting compliments from a OG like Conan is so amazing❤
17:06 - he obviously went into this show without knowing much except what his interns told him about it but they skipped, or he forgot, about Da Bomb.
Miss the old days when he was a talk show host!
This episode is gonna be hard to top. If there's a hall of fame on Hot Ones, Conan should be inducted. 🔥💀🔥
Legend says he still has a wing in his pocket
I think I just witnessed Conan lose his mind.
20:50 NOOOO HAHAHA
This reminded me of Letterman drinking the perfume whenever a celeb came on his show to promote their new line.
Love this. Thank you for bringing Conan!
God I love Conan! That was absolutely EPIC!
God bless the King🤴
When you trying not to unalive and realize someone out there gets paid to draw Conan getting assaulted by a water buffalo
COCAN IS THE KING ! Great personality and performance. 😅. I will call him uncle coco.
Can we all just take a moment to realize that, IN THE YEAR 2,000 (that we all were waiting for) was 24 Years Ago!
Been bingeing Hot ones for a couple weeks and this is the best episode I’ve seen!😂
Top 3 episode ever easy
I loved it all! I love conan! More!! More!!!🎉❤
Conan just absolutely thunder cunting da bomb is INSANE. What a legend.
These sauces are watered down
CONAN SO FUNNY ON HOT ONES !!!
Well now i gotta see if that water buffalo clip is available
I've been watching Conan for around 30 years now, big fan. I just realized, if I saw him in real life, like at a grocery store or something, and his hair didn't have it's top flippy-poufant thing.... I might not recognize him
I clicked on this 'cause I knew Conan would (in a way) hijack the interview.... and Conan did not disappoint, he delivered!
Highly entertaining episode. What a Class Act.
@FirstWeFeast please we need a directors cut of this
He turns into Walter White at the end :))
God, I remember the writer's strike when Conan had to keep going on. Still funny. I remember watching him spin his wedding ring.
Nts 22:00  5:39 20:57 23:31
😂😂😂😂😂the madness! Literally changing colors while being silly, sincere and brilliant all in turns! Bravo!
Good lord
The fact this isn't their most viewed interview is BAFFLING to me.
Conan needs to voice act an annoying politician
I like how he wouldn't even say Leno's name.
what a clever and funny guy Conan is 😂😂😂
He shouldve skip pouring Da Bomb
conan reacting to da bomb is probably my favorite thing ever
This is easily the most epic hot ones ever and i cant see how it will ever be topped.  Conan the legend.  if Conan is new to you check out his podcast.
O.o?! Great.  Good.  Googly.  Moogly... What in THE H*LL did I just (Get far too much amusement out of watching!) witness?! :-D
What a legend
The doctor has me in tears 😂😭
This episode is over the top incredible. Not bragging, but I performed on Conan's show several times and he is such a nice dude. Knowing a little of what he's actually like made this oh, so much better. The guy is a comedy genius in so many ways. And, of course Sean is such an amazing interviewer. God bless Hot Ones!!
I think Conan achieved enlightenment during this segment
Watched this three times
So funny!
Doctor: where can I get a gig like Dr Arroyo?
I got so nervous whenever he put his fingers near his eyes and I feel like he just became more unhinged the hotter the sauce got XD
This is the best Hot Ones episode ever. Not even close.
Ive watched this 3 times so far
I like this show but Sean kept quite, without warning Conan to slow down, for the ratings I assume! What If a guest gets Ulcer?
This is absolutely insane 🤣🤣🤣
Man went from Conan the Talkshow host to Conan the Barbarian just for this episode 🤣🤣
Haven't been this invested in a show since the invention of tv. A King of Spice has rodden and I doubt he will be topled
On top of everything else : he also just ate without being dainty like some other guests .. c'mon, they are wings - dig into 'em !
What a beast…. In every which way, I dip my cap sir
Dr Arroyo!!
Martin Betty Brown Elizabeth Hall Robert
Conan is a legend.  Late Night with Conan was the absolute best.
The wing drop at the end was the cherry on top of the cake.
Do not use the Lords name in vain.
what a fkn legend
Conan is underrated - and was underappreciated by yours truly…until I watched Conan Must Go - and this bit of brilliance. Bravo.
This is the first time seeing a guest on hot ones have more hot sauce than Sean. When Conan licked 'da bomb' I thought the segment would end early. You got to give it to Conan he did not flinch, kept the show going like a true professional. Respect  At the end when Sean and the cast clapped for Conan, I clapped too unknowingly before realizing I was clapping. That's a first for me
When u have a destroyer on the show. That's what u get. Pure entertainment
This is one of the top 5 best hot ones.  Soo funny!! Conan very smart and very funny. Doctor dude was pin point
Best episode. Ever.
Conan trying too hard to be funny. This was hard to watch at times
We need to have Conan on the show for a 2nd time 😂
🤣 this is hilarious  Conan is the man  Made me laugh the entire time 😂
I'm surprised Conan's tongue even works after that last one!
I wanna watch Conan react to this.
Sean had inadvertently let out the beast loose
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conan is a literal national treasure
I hate interviews, but I've always liked  "First We Feast." Conan has taken this to another level.
Absolutely brilliant 👏
The GOAT!
Top 3 of em all! Conan O'Brien is so underrated!!
Conan is the muthafkn GOAT. 🔥🔥🔥 Tears were streaming down my face watching this. DJ Khalid….this is what a REAL gangster looks like. Take that “just cuz I’m quitting, doesn’t mean I’m quitting” nonsense elsewhere. Conan O’Brien is my hero. 😂
Conan is next level badass ❤😅
This is absolutely insane!!!  If Hell’s door ever open and all devils break loose.. we definitely have to send Conan. He will save us all.
Conan is such a good comedian and a host 😂😂
Conan is the goat! 🔥🔥🔥
Conan brining the "dr" is an Andy Kaufman style move. Proving greats learn from the greats 😂 😂 also, how did Conan NOT get sauce in his eyes???? whatta beast!
Props to Conan for his acting skills.  Yeah sure you’re not feeling that hot sauce Conan.
wow that was annoying
Conan is THE Maniac of the maniacs.
What a legend 😂
Love you Conan!
Carve four new faces in Mount Rushmore. Conan, Ghandi, Popeye, and a chicken wing.
This guy’s got some serious issues.
Wait who is this 'doctor'? Is he a real doctor that just so happened to be friends with Conan, or is he a friend that pretended to be a doctor? A stethoscope to the tongue is pure genius! 🤣
Conan O'Brien Must Go was about 400 episodes too short. Hope we get more!
My favorite celebrity to ever exist.
17:18  where'd the water go? They must have saved him. Nice edit!
That Ending starting at 22:00 is pure gold. Conan is just the absolute master of improv, there will be no one after him.
Legend
Call the wife!!!😂😂😂
GOAT!
Fate whispered to Conan, "A storm is coming" And Conan whispered back, "I am the storm"
Conan Obrien  STRAINS  so hard to be funny  he shoould wear a hernia belt  ITS PATHETIC
I love you conan o'brien
18:40 ‘You cant stop me from being who I am!’ Words of wisdom.
I am watching the funniest thing ever and the most badass moments of all time in one single show... The CONAN O'Brien SHOW!!
heart of an angel and a mind as a legend <3
Lol the baseline temperature! There is only 1 Conan. 😂 He’s not the best but very affordable. 😂
we need a BTS for this episode
conan is a total tool
The doctor thing was incredibly cringey. Conan tries too hard. He's not very likeable compared to John Oliver. He seems very inauthentic.
Peak boomer comedy.
OMGOODNESS this was hilarious 😅😅😂
I think this guy needs a friend…
I love Conan!!
He’s so red in the face I just know he can’t feel his lips anymore
I love that he ends the show by giving some incredible advice in the most manic way.
Do you have Craig Ferguson? He is much funnier! :-)
If you saw Gordon Ramseys hot ones… this dude can take some punishment. What a guy. What a comedy legend. Go Consey go. :)
Henry Rollins was my favourite episode to this date. Conan is a legend... Wish him all the best man for whatever he works be doing in future. Because, it will be great for sure.
Best guest ever
Conan is cringe
😢😂😂😂😢😂😂❤😢😅 I can’t breathe 🧘‍♀️
Easily one of the funniest people on earth.
uh, 1998.
"there's no mic here, so I'm gonna wing drop" lol I love this episode, he's  absurdly extreme on his craft
The inner whites of his eyes were bleeding on that last one lol
LOL!
That's one of my favorite Harvard graduates of all time❤😂
best ever,
how did this 1 get past me conan killed it 😭
Conan had to have numbed his mouth or something. Could you imagine going #2 after this?😂
This man is gold 😂
the best
The Xperience Sauce has been independently tested several times. It barely hits 50k SHUs. Don’t believe that 2 million BS.
Best guest ever❤❤
Ok...this was no doubt brilliant and wildly entertaining a f..!!    The questions though...left me wanting..!!   They were ether vague and impersonal...to down right unbecoming and "Phoned in"..!!    It was unbelievable..!!  Like "What was the outro to commercial brake chat about"...like some  Family Guy  episode...really..‽‽    Sean didn't even connect  Max Weinberg  from Late Night...the shows as well as  Bruce Springsteen's percussionist ffs...reviling that he wasn't much of a fan, which is fine...but the lack of research, that became a staple for the show...completely missing..!!   Sorry, had to be said..!!
When  Conan  says  Max...   It fills like I'm back in the 90's...   It's wonderful..!!   xD
BOSS!!
He's....a lot
This is absolutely the best episode of all time!!!
They threw a 2 million scoville at G. Ramsay. Conan must have said to them," I want hotter."
i'll never forget the first episode i ever saw of late night. they were making jokes about the movie Con Air. that show shaped my sense of humor and i watched it nearly every night until it went off air. i am still sad that i missed the farewell tour, something i will die regretting
This is by far the best hot ones I've ever seen, Conan killed it with pure comedy and strength! I loved every single minute.
That was definitely insane!
There will never be any celebrity like Conan, he brings the energy into everything he does
When you get on the Conan Roller-coaster ride, you down ever come back down
The ending sounded like a Rick and Morty episode
Still Team Coco
Suomi mainittu, torille!!! Finland mentioned, to the market square!!!
This is AMAZING!!!
Best episodes of hot ones in history.
can we see the video with the water buffalo?
This was literally the best show in ages. I am dying
Legendary
One day I’m going to be the next Conan o’brian , very soon !
I’ve binge watched these for past few days.  After this I don’t know if I will ever watch another one.  It was so good, no other interview will ever come as close to the entertaining factor.
Conan, wipe your mouth and quit ranting like an idiot.
Conan is one of the most self centered individuals, next to Trump, that I have ever seen. He’s one of my least favorite comedians I have ever witnessed. 💩
He could possibly pump up Trumps campaign….😂
Conan’s is just smooth as silk and cool as the Arctic. Not to mention funny as………help! Probably the best quest I’ve ever seen on this channel. Wait till it comes out!😂
Favorite episode, died laughing
Conan reminds me of Trump
Me n Conan have the same birthday tf 🤣
Absolute unit
In the year 2000 conan ate hot wings
Found my new favorite episode.
lol not surprising, but Conan's perfect Andy impression at 10:03 is hilarious
Conan is crazy 🤣
😂😂😂👏👏👏
conan the barbarian!!!
I had so much fun watching this :D
That’s so funny because I’m watching this after the Shane Gillis episode and shift in energy and talent is astounding! It’s always a pleasure to watch Conan ❤❤❤
You rock Conan you were always one of the best , we the people wont ever forget!
Millennials grew up with limitless hosts like Conan.  While Gen Z grew up with boring hosts like Sean Evans.
dude your the man
love conan
I read an article once that said gingers have a higher threshold for pain than others. I think this proves to be correct. Conan slayed, I’ve never seen anything like this.
oh my God
Conan must be related to Robert Patrick! :)
One of the best episodes for sure
This was awesome
Either he feels no pain from this or some of this is faked. I've thought that it might have been faked for a while. Just some of the reactions and I love spicy food. This is one of the shows that got me back to it. I just... I don't know. I don't think it's real sometimes.
Who would’ve thought that Conan was the perfect live-action Rick Sanchez?
Conan has been the funniest so far for sure imo. 🤣
I personally love conan o'Brien one of the most underrated comedians ever ...hes a treasure 🐐
Absolute legend
I thought I was used to Conan and his antics and yet, I haven't ever laughed so hard at an episode of Hot Ones
Omfg!!!!!!!! Funniest human alive🎉
I choked on my burrito laughing so hard watching this awhile back. And it had been a few weeks since I had laughed so hard & I needed it that day. Lol I’ve got a soft spot for Conan. And what a lot of people don’t realize, is that hes a true gentleman. Being a lady, I appreciate that.   I salute him 😂👏🏻✌🏻🫡 Comedy King. 👑
0:01 video starts
Conan had me rolling on the floor with laughter. 😂 Imagine if Robin Williams would have been on this show, had he still been alive today.
Fucjing legend
One of the best 😂❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Some people’s bodies aren’t as receptive to capsaicin. Conan has to be blessed with this.
WOW!!
What an absolute showman. You know he loves and honors the craft of comedy to his soul.
Why even do more episodes? This is the peak.
Conan first wing: “This is nothing is that what this is?” Dj Khalid first wing: “Bro why is this so hot. This is too hot”
For Conan ❤
Either these are a bunch of fake sauces (for the bit), or Conan has a very unusual tolerance to spiciness. Kind of like Brandon Sanderson.  Makes for a funny episode regardless.
Shakira was the last one of the Season, but you close the season out with Conan, and Ludacris has an episode after this one but before the season 24 lineup.  This doesn't add up...
I’m going to watch every single episode and subscribe to max.
This is pound for pound, the best, single piece of content on YouTube.
This is pound for pound, the best, single piece of content on YouTube.
I am shamed to say I haven’t seen this episode jaja 😅
I’m so lost on the chicken wings in the pocket
This is such an under rated episode! I had fun watching tbh
Absolute beast!
I feel like this is very American. Crazy and a little disgusting. Or maybe not even a little...
A brand new jackets that costs hundred of dollar and will be thrown away after a single use just for a lame joke.
BEST ONE EVER!!! HE LITERALLY TOOK A SIP FROM THE BOTTLE IDK WHO ELSE WAS CRAZY ENOUGH TO DO THAT EVER !!!
BEST EPISODE!
This reminded me to take my nightly Prilosec. Thank you for your service, Conan. 🫡
Conan is invincible 🌶️
What an attitude!!
Redheads have higher pain and anesthesia tolerance, look it up!
Holy smokes!!! Conan is my favorite entertainer ever! Wow!!!
I’m dying 😂
The greatest episode of all time. It’s all downhill from now on. Conan is a God. Unhinged, diabolical, hilarious.
Conan is crazy 😂😂😂
I've never seen a more intelligent man who was willing to look so idiotic for a laugh. Mad props.
He, CLEARLY, needed a doctor BEFORE attempting to eat these wings 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conon looks like Trump from behind 😂
His and Sabrina carpenters and pueghs are the best so far that I have seen I just discovered this
Was he okay after this? I'm genuinely concerned for this man's well being 😂 What a goated legend.
😂😂😂☺️🔥🥹
24:10 he becomes Rick Sanchez for a good while 😂
It almost sounds like Will Wood music at 4:15!
I can honestly say ive never had such a physical laugh and shock reaction from watching hot ones.
Conan took these sauces like a boss!
April 18th is MY birthday. thanks.
This is the best episode I've ever seen! Sooooo funny.
Best episode ever.
"Youre not a doctor are you"
this show made me laugh so hard that i became winded. im love with you concan and sean
even rewatching this four months later this is still the best crazy bizarre comedy. Dr Arroyo needs an Emmy nom
Conan is so awesome lol
Unhinged!
HANDS DOWN... the absolute BEST EPISODE... of ALL time!!!
When they ask Sean about his favorite Hot Ones episodes for years to come I guarantee this will always be on the list.
Is conan a regular show character? Bros acting like Benson when he had too many hot wings
I need a 3 meter sculpture in my room of Conan O'Brien. Best showmen ever
“Can you check my pulse for me?” “Yup, still there” 😂😂😂
22:22 Conan is a LEGEND! 🤝 Usually people can/ will only take a bite but Conan not only devours them but adds A LOT more sauce to them! Guess though, since he’s the top TV entertainer he figures it’s his job/ duty 😅
Conan… Don’t know how old he is, but looks between 45-50 years old only.  1:35 Bringing a physician lol 🤣  Everyone loves an elite journalist 😊 Probably cause so many are so bad 😅  If Sean gets someone on the show who absolutely hates journalists and gets a compliment where the person acknowledges how great he is at his job— ultimate compliment 😊 Probably will happen too— or has?  19:09 Conan for the most part seems to take hot sauce like the sci-fi Terminator takes bullets 🤣🤭👍🏻 😁
i guess this interview will be Sean's favorite of all time in the next years
pocket chicken 😅
Conan is a comedy genius
I had to go check if Conan was still alive...
Conan's toilet was the real victim here
18:29 oh my god
22:54 So funny how Sean was just about to close it up and then laughs as we cut to Conan's melted face
The only thing that "may" have made this funnier is if Jordan was with him! lol Been watching Conan since the 90's and he always makes me laugh.
Conan is an absolute savage legend.. I love it!
L E G E N D A R Y
23:00
Off.The.rails! Conan for the win!
Im dying in here!!! ROFL
This is madness
Respect to all guests, but watching other "hot ones" after this one is like watching Marvel shows after "Avengers: Endgame"... There is no point!
This is how benson acted off them wing kingdom wings🤣🤣
Who choose the music… it just makes no sense 😂
the second half of this show makes me uncomfortable
That was incredible
The Irish really are built different...
Conan is the best 😂 I haven't laughed this much watching hot ones 🤣
he’s got quite an attitude…
The best one! I was laughing so hard
Voltaire’s Candide is hilarious. I’m sure conan would agree.
i fear no man; but that thing.... it scares me
Conan's physical comedy is sick. The dude is committed.
The doctor is a paid actor
Conan's humor is not for me, but i absolutely respect him 😂 he did great and is a great showman.
Pulse check request Dr. Arroyo proceeds, and says “It’s there.”
Goat of this show
I like how he finishes the whole wings
Conan the barbarian
This was way better than dj khaled lol
Get this man a napkin.
This guy is Broly
The pocket thing had me DEAD !
I swear he was channeling Nicholson's version of the Joker
this was the best show ever
“What’s wrong with me?? Why can I feel!??” Same Conan, same 😂
Only Conan and the classic SNL crew (Farley, Will, Eddie, Murry ect) can give me out of breath wheezing laughter.
he drank the fking bottle LOOOL
Conan hasn't changed a bit in the past 30 years. 😅
Because Conan said you are a great host and interview I’m gonna subscribe
pls get Jim Carrey on this.
The fake doctor would be hilarious to bring back but only during random interviews...not all
"What's wrong with me, why can't I feel?" ROTF Conan is a fkn riot!
Conan is killing me. The Bomb is the worst sauce in the lineup and he poured it on a wing and licked it off. He's out of his mind. I'm really laughing here.
Brings me back 20 years to when i was kid watching conan on fuzzy antennae tv
Conan is krazy 😂😂😂
Two absolutely legendary interviewers. The legendary Sean Evans, and the only good late night host. Love Conan so much.
This is how it's done. Thank you Conan.
Dr Arroyo is amazing!😂
😮😂😮🤯🤯🤯
He forgot to put them in his pocket after dabomb 😂 or the one b4 also i may b wrong mayb he did get them all in his pocket
Quite possibly the absolute  pinnacle of a interview ! I haven't been this enthralled and engaged in a interview in such a long time! God I'm glad i saw this episode... Good job guys!
Omgoodness.....is he okay?
Love how he pokes fun at MAX
Dr. Arroyo is the real MVP of this episode. That's the kind of doctor I need. Not a good one but an affordable one.
Conan makes coke fiends look like passive npcs
Utter Chaos
saved the best for the last episode, i see.
Conan legit hijacked the talk show with his showmanship with pocketing the food and mr arroyo lol I loved the videos he had with Jordan specially the italian trip
This was one of the best episodes ever 😂😂😂 And what a great compliment to get from Conan; you truly are a great host Sean 👍🏻💪🏻
Master piece i Love you Conan you make the world a happy place❤
Now that's how it's done!
23:00 I’m fine! I’m perfectly f*cking fine. 🤣 💀
Conan Obrien will always be a legend in whatever he does. 🎉
I can't believe my eyes. He is absolutely nuts.😂
Conan...takes the last dab to the Last Drink! YOU GO BROTHER!
This was the best hot ones by far!
he sounds like master shake
"My intestines have turned to acid, and I still remember the plug! That's a professional!!" Couldn't agree more, Conan. Couldn't agree more.
Conan brought the A game.
Invite Trump now!
No late night show or host has ever made me laugh half as much as Conan has
It's not a bit.  It's life!
This is why Conan is the GOAT. He will always be my favorite. More than everyone else. Ever.
Just WOW, what a episode man! :D
A good interview for sure, but I just don't buy into the notion that Conan is this comedic "genius" so many claim he is. He always comes across as trying way too hard to be funny and I find myself being annoyed, rolling my eyes, and not laughing at all. He's a great performer, sure. But his humor just does not resonate with me in the slightest.
Best fricking episode. True legend. For any legend that was ever on this show, WELL THIS MAN INTERVIEWED LEGENDS 😭😭. Intelligent and funny 😭😭❤️❤️. From a fan, I’m blessed I got to visit a Conan interview.
I would love to have a night on the town with Conan.  He might be brilliant.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA WHAT IS THIS MAN 21:40
This is exactly why hes my favorite❗️ Conan is Universal
Im so excited about this 😂
I've never laughed so hard lol
Don’t forget this sir is one of the reasons why The Simpsons got their success… what a genius. 🫡
You have to give him props my lord
Conan is a monster 👻
“ I’m feeling it this one I’m not gonna lie. It’s starting to peek through” and within those few clips, his glass of water suddenly turns into a glass of milk 🤣🤣🤣
Who gave Conan the laced wings ☠️☠️☠️
i unliked this video just so i could experience liking it again
this feels like the joker if he was benevolent
“Can I keep these?” 😂
CONAN THE DESTROYER OF WINGS❤😂🎉
I love how in the end Conan turned into Charley Chaplin in the dictator giving his speech on comedy lol
Conan, absolute legend!
Why do I see a correlation between Conan and Robin Williams?
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT CONAN WOULD BE THE BEST HOT ONES CHALENGER.
I can not believe Conan did that. THAT WAS INSANE !!!!
Not exaggerating about the bland food in an Irish house
😂😂😂😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🥵🥵🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This man is a a true comedian, from the start to end he was catering for Sean and the fans ,laughs after laugh , shock fun moments .What a  Comedy Demon 😈😂😂😂😂😂😂
THIS WAS INCREDIBLE!
I think we witnessed a man go insane slowly
"Whats wrong with me why cant I feel?" - It took me out 😂
7:40 for the Dr Arroyo's premium pulse taking
That closing monologue was amazing. If that was off the cuff I’m just amazed.
Funniest thing I've ever seen in my life
He is terrible
The water buffalo 😂
You can always tell who the masochists are...they go back to the "Da Bomb" on purpose....and off the top of my head it tends to be the male comedians...Conan Obrien, Shia, Ryan Reynolds, Vince Vaughn a hint of macho and "hey look at me perform... I like to hurt to feel alive." I like it when they push the envelope lol. 🤣😂😅
Conan ripped it to shreds. Master of comedy and rolled up the Scoville Heat Units chart, and used it for a suppository delivery ! What a f’kn maniac. Love him. He is one of the all time best hosts and an excellent writer and comedian.
The description of Conan's show sounds like the opposite of Phil's "Somebody Feed Phil" and I love it. TO that note, ya'll need to bring Phil Rosenthal on the show, and pair him with his brother. Let Richard suffer a little, too. XD
20:35 BEST PART!!😂😂 24:10
This is the best one ever.
Dr Royo is a good man… and thorough.
It goes without saying that Conan is a true entertainer. Not only did dominate the wings and put on great show, he made a point to complement one of his young peers; someone who I’m sure idolizes him, time and time again. Reminding us just how much of an icon and cool Conan O’Brien is.Respect!!!
Well, that was wierdly fun...
We love and miss you, BRIAN
He loves the shock factor 🤣🤣🤣
That guy is insane ! Bravo 👌👌👌
We love and miss you, BRIAN
I'm drying watching this. So funny 😂
By far the best episode yet....and I'm really a Conan fan.
I literally applauded.
DJ Khaled quit before this point. He will never live that down. (Wing four)
I can't believe this is not the most popular Hot Ones episode!
Wow Conan is a wolf M’fer 😂 🤯 🥵
he slowly turned into macho man
Easily one of the best eps in the entire run. This cements Conan's GOAT status.
Should have asked about his favorite and least favorite moments at Harvard. Conan is STILL a rock star. This is my favorite Hot Wings episode 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Conan is the greatest showman and comedian in history.
Always loved Conan... This is pure GOLD! Dude's shows are amazing on any platform. 🎉🔥 TEAMCOCO
Funny how the hotter the wings the louder and crazier Conan got , loved it !!!!!!
Thank you all!! One of the best shows !! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🥰🥰🥰
Conan 🥇Comedy genius. Much respect from Chicago💯
NO ONE WILL EVER TOP CONAN! NO ONE! THIS IS HOT WING HISTORY! HOLY $HIT! I CANNOT BELIEVE HE DID THAT AT THE END!
That was unbelievable.
Bravo Conan O'Brien, I would never expect that he is the true king of Hot Ones. 🫡
I bet you live 4 years tops😂 just to keep the footage rolling 😂😂😂😂
Best one ever!
Conan just hits me right. This is the best episode, outside of Stonecold.
Andy was right.... He won Jeopardy!
🤣
funniest ever, also this man is a killer and psychopath..... will watch his new show....... f*%$ killer.  Best show ever
Conan really put the chicken wings in his pocket for later 😂😂😂 & goes thru all the sauces, drinks one of them has a little effect but gets to the last bottle & drinks it & now he regretting it 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I never laughed so hard!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Next level,Conan His manicness got him through the pain😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We desperately need a JRE with Conan and Rogan
Team CoCo
Can I take these...? Conan is a awesome!!!
This guy is the mf, nobody like Conan
I have watched so many Hot Ones eps and this is THE BEST ever.  Conan has always been one of my favorites and he just owned it here!!!
Savage
Wait... Did Conan just pulled off a Dr Nick Riviera out of his pocket!????
Conan is just one of those people that hot sauce doesn’t affect.
Man that was funny, Conan still the best!
i dont know if the bottles are rigged with tomato sauce or conan is just being a boss but either way its amazing. if that really was Da Bomb then he took it like it was nothing
"Why can't I feel???!!!"
conan is an animal!!
The da bomb part 😂😂
Love Conan 😂
This is so universally hilarious.  It is like music that really is amazing.  Everyone gets it. Culture, color, it does not matter one iota.
Re-release this with a badge of honor or something. Ask Sean if he wants to
How I missed Conan putting wings in his pockets is beyond me
No one can talk through the pain like Conan. 🤣 He should be a doula
Crying laughing at the end!!!
The bar has been SET! The best!
Conan showing the young'uns how it's done. ❤
What a showman Conan is🔥
My favourite one yet! Love Vince Vaughn.
After that discourse on comedy the ending was surprisingly real and heart string tuggy..
He´s not good doctor, he´s affordable doctor 😅
It's the putting chicken wings in his pocket for me
My gawd. Respect to a legend.
Wow, absolute legendary episodes
Conan’s dry cleaner is sweating more than he is watching this episode.
The man stole the show! That was brilliant!
I hiccough when I go overspicey too  hah
This might be the most impressive 'Hot-Ones' performance in history.
he's like "Max...such an odd name..."  ...  ...  ???  does he know he's being funny?  Max Weinberg and the Max Weinberg 7
Comedy GOAT
Conan: "I'm terrible with spice" Also Conan: **humiliates the host and every single guest ever by demolishing Da Bomb**
most pumped episode ever
one of the most expected unexpected things ive ever seen.
that... was wild.
I miss Conans show
"Charlie Rose show where you are eating hot wings". My goodness, that is accurate
To be fair, I would watch Conan do improv with a sheet of ice
I just love Conan..in my opinion the best and funnyest late night host of all time
"I am perfectly F*cking fine", I think everyone can relate to this moment!
Conan took this thing to a WHOLE new level....there's really not a close second now.
Had Conan not had supportive parents he would’ve been a world class stand up comedian. Instead he was instilled with confidence, so he became the best late night show host of all time.
This was insane! Love it!
Oh man, i love yhese episodes but this has got to be one of the best. Conan is absolutely nuts, a true comedian. I was laughing the while way through. Bravo to everyone involved.
I don’t think he’s entirely well! 😂😂😂
I see why this has 11M views in 3 months, a hot ones record
Who was hosting who?😂
3 months later, and I had to check in. I cant believe the Reynolds/Jackman episode already has more views.   What is wrong with this world. This is comedic art.
that was simply incredbile
seans really does ask some great questions. Connan is such an interesting dude too, fantastic ep.
The bottle shot was legendary! This man is golden.
He said "Call the wife!" after rubbing his nips with Scoville 300,000 hot sauce
Oh. my. GOSH I laughed harder than Kamala being asked a serious question!! I'm DYING!!! Team CoCo forEVER!!!!!!!
Conan is the GOAT. There's no one better.
Conan owned this! Miss his show! Always the best!
god i love conan
Conan’s hot ones starring former hot ones guest
i thought vince was good, conan just blew the competition out of the water.
Conan is a genius in my eyes but I can't help but think of the late robin Williams on this episode
Conan absolutely killed it. Greatest Showman!
This is great info! So much infor, especially being a good host.  I was horrified for his health. Haha And then Conan seemingly losing his mind! Hahahaha  Also, props to Sean, being praised by Conan for his skills as a host and interviewer. Very well done sir.
Ah my god I love this man. What an episode.
"Whats wrong with me? Why cant I feel?" <3
my favorite part is watching Conan's face slowly grow more and more red over the course of the show
ITS NOT THE BEST BUT VERY AFFORDABLE  HAHAHAHAH :) :): )
There’s Conan There’s Halle Then there’s everyone else.
That's a brilliant!! Conan is the man!!😂🎉
"WHY CaNT i feEL"
I'm still waiting Sean Evans taking a drink from the last dab bottle with Conan.
God bless Conan O' Brien
I think Conan, albeit being truthful about his Irish roots, is as adept at handling spice as he is adept at being a spicy character. He just said he has no experience with spice at all to set up the joke. Dude grew up eating bland, Irish shepherd’s pie and can go on to crush all the wings. Just an absolute comedy professional 😂
This video makes me want buffalo wings so bad bro im going to applebees so hard tomorrow
My second time watching this interview, and realizing that Conan really did something clever here. He spent the whole interview telling us how to be a good showman WHILE showing us exactly what he meant in the way he kept entertaining   I wonder if he had this all planned out
I love Conan’s goofiness and intelligence. He doesn’t care about being “too big” in his delivery
I think we need a director-cut version of this episode from both Sean and Conan's POVs. I pay $20 for it. Who is with me?
impressive
Jesus Christ I think Conan has turned into Dennis Hopper here, like I havent seen this kind of maniac energy since Blue Velvet!
I would live to see Donald Trump do the Hot Ones interview, You would get a Billion Views
I can't believe how much he used it. Conan is the best at everything, even testing hot ones.
20:52 Conan channelled the spirit of the late Chris Farley (rip).
Why the covid set. Move closer together.
What an entertainer! Great job Conan
This episode is summed up in one word : "Epic"
Conan is my all time fav comedian. NO one beats him. "I'm irish so I never saw a spice untill I was 52 years old" 😂 he is so original and so funny
Most iconic and legendary Host meets the King of Hosts ( I will let you figure out who is who :)
i showcased a gary busey
Conan is one of a kind. Very impressive.
"I should be." Dr Arroyo nailed every line with flawless timing
If the Joker did Hot Ones
It's a joy the here this man talk I can listen to him for hours one of my favorites
That eye tic...
This should catapult Conan to the Mark Twain Prize next year
Easily the most innovative and courageous of all late night hosts In a walk By miles
Best episode ever
Conan rules!!!!
FCKING LEGEND.
😂
This is the best episode ever. Hope to see conan again.
I won't play
Connan is the Goat! LOL
why is he so FUNNY
Best episode!! hands down, had me rolling!
One of the best episodes I’ve seen 🤣
conan  will be like : "hi death ... u look red but beautiful , nice tan though "
the water buffalo animation was hilarious
This show has peaked, Conan is incredible
I love the question "What has been your most harrowing experiences with wildlife?"
I could watch this a hundred times and still be amazed at Conan rubbing hot sauce all over his face and chest.
I love the interview questions Sean and his team come up with.  Amazing !
Conan at the start of the interview : "I'm terrible with hot food" Also Conan, proceed to drink a bottle of hot sauce
I like to think Conan coated his mouth with candle wax, Homer Simpson style, right before this started.
I think one of the funniest episodes ever. I had tears from laughing so hard.
"They used to call it HBO but people found that too popular!" 💀
Nobel prize winner for comedic genius goes to Conan. Bravo, maestro.
Conan for President
There is no comedian better than Conan!
I tellmy kids this is donald trump
This is the 4th time I've watched this since it aired and he still has me nearly in tears. Been watching this show from the very beginning, and this is by far my favorite, most chaotic episode.
Best. Episode. Ever. 😂😂
best episode till date. 👍 conan is amazing
RIP Bee Arthur (that joke was savage)
Greatest guest ever
Conan O'brien is the man. The best EVER! If he takes another swig i'm out. Thank you, Conan, for bringing me to tears.Oh my goodness.
Was you medical school 4 years? “It was supposed to be” 😂😂😂😂
Conan must've had that strain of COVID that ruined your taste buds 😅😅
Perfection.
Love Conan but would have liked not to see the food outside his mouth
Conan NEVER disappoints 😂😂😂
Wuow how did he manage that 😂😂😂 that was great
Best online comedy bit of 2024
Conan is a legend
Conan is the true king of comedy!
I love how he was goofing off as usual but then was really open and heartfelt when answering the questions. Best professional clown I've ever seen.
When the world stops making sense I come back to this masterpiece!
Sean, please get Jordan Schlansky on the show
Conan was /is already a GOAT and OG of comedy. And this appearance sealed the deal beyond any shadow of a doubt for me. Who else could do what he just did without breaking, and  still being wildly entertaining and funny? Even his explanation of how producers placed him in environments and scenarios that were like a comedy vacuum,  makes me appreciate his genius and talent all the more  He's turned some of the most unfunny scenarios and people on his show into real joy and laughter.
I thought Deadpool and wolverine was great, no one beats Conan
Conan "The Whitest of White Irishmen" O'Brien took those sauces like a champ. I can't even do a red pepper on a good day 😂
If this was my first episode, I would say those sauces were fake, jeeeezzze Conan is....crazy or a straight up monster 😂😂😂😂😂😂
If you were to have Conan on again, but this time with Jordan Schlansky, I could die a happy man.
Man is a legend.
Best episode hahahaha
I love Conan
Best hot ones …..
This was amazing!
Conan’s sincerity and humbling closing comments about finding humor wherever it takes you
May as well retire the show nobody will ever top Conan
YES!!! GO CONAN!!! One of the best😅
That opening was wild.
They should take the temperature at the beginning and end for everybody
Watching this after the Ryan and Hugh vid makes them look like huge Wimps XD but Godbless them for doing the vid they’re always great
Made me respect his comedic talent alot more. And i had alot already
I was a bit concerned
I love Conan. He's such a legend. Great episode.
“Call the wife!”
So Irish...
One of the best Hot Ones EVER!
Conan is the best. A true OG. Best hot ones ever!
The GOAT
😂😂😂
well god dayum, Conan and David Blaine destroyed the challenge
Did anyone else notice the massive viscosity difference between Conan's and Sean's sauces? Especially on the last one.
I remember when he was here in Berlin and he had a fun time with Mistress velvet steel 😂
Based on the comments, I guess I’m the only one who found Conan completely obnoxious. I truly don’t get why people are referring to him as a comedic “genius” and saying this is the best episode of Hot Ones ever.
Why is he putting the wings in his pockets im dying 😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀
Epic, Legendary. BY FAR THE BEST EPISODE!
What a legend! Funniest episode yet! I was howling with laughter and tears streaming down my face! 😂😂😂😂
Bravo. What a speech at the end
that was genuinely impressive
The sheer willpower Conan demonstrates here is awe inspiring
As someone who has eaten Da Bomb, I can’t believe what I just watched. I couldn’t function for 10 minutes after I ate a wing coated in it. Wow.
THis si the best one yet. Unbelievably funny and entertaining. Conan is the GOAT
I have NOTHING but love for Conan O'Brien. Why did he ever left talk show hosting?. But looking at hosts today, they tend to be politicised and maybe its good that he left since I would hate Conan being coerced to push politics to audience.
I've watched this 3 times since it dropped GOAT 😂
I cant help but wonder how insane Robin Williams would be on this show.
10 million views 😂
Hysterical!!  Haven't laughed at Conan like that in over a decade!
the trick is to get Covid before the show
BEST EPISODE EVER.  Conan is a legend among men.
I've watched this episode 10 times now. By far my fav. Conan always sells the bit. Watch his episode of Murderville.
Get Tim Allen
Please get Leonardo d’ caprio
genuinely impressed he didn't touch his eyes
He's the GOAT. No debate.
Conan has taught himself how to do the joker make up while doing an interview now that's impressive
I like to watch this episode directly after DJ Khaled to really reinforce how pathetic that man is.
Most iconic episode to me conan is the living legend Host
This is like Eric Andre levels of unhinged
I'm delighted that Conan is one of the best interviewees you've ever had!!??
I haven’t laughed this hard for so long 😂😂 tq so muchh
The GOAT 🐐 GOAT 🐐 GOAT 🐐
Conan had me thinking that he was capsaicin proof.
For some reason i want to see Conan host the presidential debate..
🙏🐐
22:55 🤣 that look of absolute concern in Seans eyes sends me THEN that straight cut to Conan whose just in complete shambles lol easily funniest episode yet
😂
He's insane 😂😂😂😂
Conan is my hot ones hero.. woow😂😂 brilliant
what an absolut beast 🤣
Press keys 6 and 7 for more entertainment
Conan is the best by far. I am watching it again. Thanks Conan!
Conan actually had Covid during the filming of this episode.
I bow to the level of sacrifice Conan makes for Comedy!… 🙇
I will always love this man
You know he probably went to the hospital after this 😮🔥 😂
Conan is the best😅
just look at the first shot of conan in this episode and the last and you will understand why this is one of the best episodes of hot ones ever
Oh my God that waa great
this was hilarious lol
iconic lol
Amazing mind over matter, surprised he didnt need a hospital and get a stomach ulcer and at his age too.
Me & my bro painted my old Scout in a barn with insufficient masks.  We got high.  We went to Taco Bell & I ate a bunch of the Fire packets bc I couldn't feel my face.
At the end, Conan went full Rick Sanchez on this one.
without a doubt the best episode yet. Conan is the GOAT of all things comedy 🎭
He's really going to pull those right out of his pocket and eat them just like that....lint and all 🤣🤣🤣
He is now legend on hotones
THE BEST EPISODE EVER!! THANKS CONAN!
That's the final boss right there.😂
Best hot ones guest ever!  Best late night personality ever.
Like how both guys are both great interviewers and knows if u get cut off mid sentence it’s a sign off weakness so u can see and hear them talk over each other alot
Conan is going to regret drinking that hot sauce later on in the bathroom.
Wow lol
Now THAT was a Rollercoaster... 😂
Remember that, don’t ask me to stop who I am, can’t stop who I am, I am who I am
“..CALL THE WIIIFE!!”
Epic
Wow. . . How can he eat that
Wow
Whats the scoville level for the makeup on his face.
Respect Conan😊
Absolutely Legendary😂😂😂😂
We need Jordan Schlansky on this show.
Of all the times I've read the Bible, I never laughed once.  I guess I'm the only one offended and that's alright
The epitome of bad taste, the absolute trashing of anything remotely resembling style, does this tie go with my denim jacket!.
CONAN IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE EPIC 🔥🔥🔥LOVE HIM SO MUCH!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥THE GOAT FOR REAL!!
funny but gross
You can’t expect anything less than one of the best shows inviting a Harvard graduate comedic genius
truly was not expecting that level of debauchery
His face definitely got redder as it progressed. Haha. Conan is awesome. What a guy. Most late night hosts from that time were not my favourite… letterman was downright creepy. Conan was and is awesome. ❤
Legend
Not a single wince. He kept to the bit in absolute stoic fashion. Master of the craft.
If redheads have a higher tolerance to anesthesia, I wonder if there’s a correlation to having a higher tolerance of other things (like capsaicin). 🌶️ 🤔
He came here thinking, I am not going to allow them to make me the Joke, only he can make himself be funny how he will allow it.
All I can hear is master shake I wasn’t watching just listening but lol. He sounds just like him
Conan talks about what guests do to ruin a show, and it's to turn to the camera and say "This isn't going well." He then proceeds to turn to the camera numerous times on a show called HOT ONES and say that none of the wings are going to be hot. Did he know what he was doing there?!
he succeeded in totally grossing me out..... but... he succeeded in owning the show.....
Dude who was committed to finishing the wings, didnt let it beat him, freaking drank the last dab.  Im confused if it was maybe staged
Look how the table has turned
I love how unhinged Conan gets in this episode so funny
He is crazy, but he is doing it!!
Hard to believe this guy connon is allowed out on the streets.
Respect bro
Conan is the GOAT of The Hot Ones.  His comedic genius!  Thank you for always making me laugh!
Conan is all about the entertainment, and he's made for it! He puts his own stamp on this show and I freakin love it! 🤣😂
Conan is boss. He didn't even shed a tear when he finished Da Bomb.👍🏾😃
"The other guy" lol love the Jay Leno shade 😂😂
Jaw dropping. Oh my god. The man is a legend indeed 👌 much respect to conan.
Is he adhd?
This legend will be remember forever..
conan is extremely hilarious 😂
The less you know, the better...was that a Tame Impala reference? 😱😱😱🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
He’s going to feel it in a few hours, in the bathroom. 😂
I’m actually worried 😂
Am I the only one who thinks this is cringey
absolute beast!
I love you coco! ❤
The craziest episode ever, Conan went all out.
At 12:29 you grew a mole look at your upper lip
Thank you Mr Snurkle, Yiur hair is happy underwater like cartoon I like.
This has to be one of the best interviews. Holy shait, he is a madman
GOAT
Good God what a awesome episode hats off to conan wow 👌
this metal is what brand you don't
seven days beyonce you plotted backwards
what they argue over class ; he wearing his shoes in that woman house greeting
sugar and spice is twice as
❤ he is truly Goat 🐐 for this
Amazing 🤩
Wow…😮
THIS HAD ME IN TEARS !! SO FUNNY !!
How many times you think he went to the bathroom that day
Conan is a legend, I love that dude.
Conan comedy reminds me of Rick n morty. lol
Conan u crazy man
This literally had me laughing out loud, thanks Coco
this is gold!
Worst episode to date. Too bad it's the season finale. The first half is interesting and entertaining. I loved how Conan gives Sean a compliment for being a good and well-prepared interviewer. I totally agree. Sean is amazing at digging up little-known details and turning them into really interesting questions. Lost count of how many times guests tell him "Wow, that's a really good question" or "Nobody had ever asked me that before". Keep up the good work Sean!  But then, after 13:30, Conan transforms into a loud annoying attention-seeking child. Nothing close to actual humor about it. Just a clown. Some people say 'Wow, Conan took over the entire show'. By screaming and acting like a 14 year old? Is that taking over the show? I would just classify it as disrespectful.   But hey, people here seem to love it so it's ok. Probably just not my cup of tea. But I did feel the urge to put my thoughts in a comment for feedback purposes.
Who would’ve thought that the hardest mf to enter the ring at Hot Ones would be Conan. Absolute legend.
Conan complimented Sean on being a great interviewer, chugged hot sauce multiple times including the last dab and barely reacted. Top notch episdoe
It takes a lot of self control to be drooling that much and talking like nothing is wrong
The sauce has no effect because he's Irish and has no soul.
Conan skull f***ed every bottle of hot sauce and is still alive .. God Mode Activated
😂❤❤❤❤❤
20:58 / 21:25  this is just AMAZING.  Gracias El Conan.
This man is the Legend of TV. Always will be. Sincere, smart and unapologetic
best episode ever i’m crying 😭
x times watching...just love Conan
holy he is so entertaining xD
This dude is gold, still does vaguely remind me of a ADHD version of Brian Cranston hahahaa
This man destroyed da bomb 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Conan is great showman. I can imagine he was on fire at the end, but show must go on. :D
i think its fair to say, conan isnt afraid of hot sauce. the hot sauce is afraid of him
CALL THE WIFE!!
This is the best hot ones episode ever.
So ladies and gentlemen, there is a true american showman.
Either conan has exposed the scam of hot sauces, or his need to entertain is greater than we ever could imagine.
Noone will EVER top this episonde. Noone. I am not sure about many things in my life. But this episode... NEVER will anyone give us a better show.
THE GREATEST TO EVER DO IT. PERIOD PERIOD PERIOD
How does this not have the most views? It's the best hot ones interview ever.
best hot ones EVER
Okay. Conan is metal AF.  The metal community should give him the official title of metalhead.
This is comedy gold
"I don't fear your wings, man "  - Conan O'Brien, 2024
This was pretty great. Loved this episode.
We Just Saw Some Legendary Stuff! 👍👍👍👍
I thought i reached peak insanity then the video kept rolling
Jimmy fallon next or kimmel
True Masterclass.
This is the best episode!!!
)))))))))))))
Best episode so far
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My hero :)
the way he asked every time before he put it in his pocket by just “hmm?” 🤌🏻🍗
SEAN FACE AT 22:36 😂😂
The best one.
My ADHD loved this
Why can't I feel? I burst out laughing at work. Very awkward.
BEST GUEST EVER!........ DUDE IS A REPTILLIAN!
5:00~
Why’s he collecting the half eaten wings in his pocket though?
24:56 💀💀💀
I m big fan of conan 😂❤
Conan became pepper.
Watched this three times. Wow. That was beyond humor, beyond comedy. Conan: GET HELP.
Am i the only one who loved his jacket
Conan always has me in tears😂😂😂
Conan is insane 😂😂 I love it. Imagine if he ran for president?!
I never seen such a combination of fear and admiration than here in the eyes of Sean Evans
wow, just amazing interview!!! much love from Texas!!!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
19:35  This aged well in light of Biden's ghost-written bail-out letter released yesterday (7.21.24).
😂😂😂😂
I think what has happened is Conan has such a lack a taste he never developed the ability to even detect spices.
Conan is this era's Robin Williams
This has to be the best episode yet! 😂 iv never watched Conan’s show and after this , I don’t have to! 😂 this was good!!
The best episode ever
incredible!!!!
Top Tier Episode. This HAS to go in the top 5 of all time. Probably #1. I am in tears.😂😂
I gotta say, This might br my favorite.  (but also DJ Kalid)
Conan O’Brien Advanced Difficulty
He is like Eric Andre but somehow the insanity is less expected and therefore hits you even harder.
I wish he asked about Paul Rudd skit he preformed on Conan
Talk about going 110%
He must be on coke
this will be studied
Conan the Barbarian! He slayed!!
best. episode. ever!
Could not watch the last part lol
Hands down one of my favorite celebrities
You can count on Conan to do something only Conan would do 😂
Bro is crying at the end
Conan is sort of a beast 😂😂 this is probably the best episode ever that i didnt know i needed.😂
The stethoscope to the tounge. I lost it
Me waiting for Conan to snort da bomb 👀👀
Conan took the show here :D
Fire works= extremely spicy diarrhea
This brought me a lot of joy today. Conan was awesome lol.
At the end of the show... Conan: thank you sean for coming to the show.
One of the best episodes. Conan is amazing.
Conan is the BEST!!! A true master of his craft! This is the best Hot Ones I've seen in years, if not ever!  Simple side note, we share the same birthday ♥♥♥
This is the best hot ones episode period.
23:51 cut to da Bomb just slowly pouring out as Conan descends into madness
Just watched someone from the robin williams cloth! This was a masterclass!
Best episode, hands down!!
One of my favorite episodes ever Conan is a legend
Well, might as well stop the show, noone will ever beat this
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conan is just used to suffering.
Forget milk. What works is taking a sip of the juice that jarred pickles or banana peppers are soaked in. Instant relief. I don't know why more people don't know this
so COOL
BEST INTERVIEW EVERRRRRRRRRR!!!!
This is hands down, the best episode of Hot Ones ever! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oh. My. God.
Conan O'Brian is THE HERCULES of the show Hot Wings.  The way he drank hot sauce: IMPRESSIVE!❤
Sean was really scared and worry! Conan wasn’t sweating!! Wow respect
This was the BEST Hot Ones i have ever seen! Had be laughing the entire time. lol
Fun fact: red heads have a higher threshold for pain…and pain management needs to account for this in their formulation when they get surgeries
This man is a performer.  Wow.
All of it. Its fuxking Conan!
Conan is not and never will be funny.
Guys I think this might be the best one yet
That was an amazing ride
Hes putting his wing bones in his pocket hahahhahahhaaaaaaaa
That was like trying to fight Ganon with 3 hearts and a wooden sword lol, Conan reigns King and Sean respectfully let him have the stage, definitely my favorite of all.
Just when I thought Hot Ones was done, best episode of all time .....
This is by far THE GREATEST interview ever❤😂
Conan looks WILD up close 😂
Conan is simply the funniest person ever. Nobody makes me laugh the way he does.
Conan is DSM 5 sociscpath. ThAF but im worried about his wife.
Honestly Sean has seen every kind of person in this show.
incredible.  Drank tabasco straight from the bottle... Highest level of comedy.  To suffer terribly so that others can have a good time.  Hats off to Conan.
Ma boii got a compliment from the goat Conan. Check that off your bucket list
Idk how this is not the most popular video in this channel. The is the best out of all of them
gingers don't feel heat, the only type they feel heat from is directly from the sunlight..and that comes in bad ways..😮‍💨
Conan will always and forever be my favorite person ever🤣🤣
Legend
How is this only at 10M still? I myself have watched at least 1M times.
Conan is a cool dude
What a legend holyyyy
Why is his head so big?
Conan’s talked before about his performance adrenaline overpowering pain and shame, and we just got a brilliant glimpse into that!
Jeez he made me wipe my own mouth😂😂
Conan is my hero!!
Conan inspired me partly for my channel. One day i hope to go in to presenting like this!
Conan really asked for the full experience.
This is it this is the best episode
Conan doesn't know how to be a quest, he suffers from a condition called "Imaguestphobia" 😳(He smoked his own J's before the show.) but I'm sure he needed a milk bath after this episode.
7:00 to 7:04 - Yet another guest complimenting him on his interviewing prowess.  16:28 Beyond insanity.
Probably the best Hot ones I've ever seen. Love Conan awesome questions from Sean.
conan is out of this world.
I laughed so hard! Best episode ever!!!
Pure insanity pepper.
Please have Taylor Tomlinson on the show!!!
THIS IS THE GREATEST HOT ONES OF ALL TIME!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Conan is the greatest host and the greatest talking entertainer of all time.  It’s funny how overshadowed these “interview” Youtubers are when they have him on their channel.
The funniest episode ever! 😂😂
This was the best episode of Hot ones for me.
This was your best episode ever. Hard to see anyone topping this.
robin williams would be proud
Hands down the best episode of the series! Conan is an absolute lunatic 😂😂😂  I love it ❤
Still one of my favorite episodes of Hot Ones!  Finally! Here comes a guest who not only eats nearly the entire wing each time but douses the wing with extra sauce and proceeds to chug a bottle of the hottest sauce! Not every guest should do this obviously but this was VERY refreshing to see since most guests take the TINIEST of nibbles from each wing and then pat themselves on the back, openly telling Sean and the audience how proud of themselves they are and that they're doing so great! Give me a break!
🔥Conan🔥
"No, he doesn't even understand the numbers."😂😂😂😂😂
Has anyone met the creator?
The king 🎉
My hero *Popeye* killed me
PLEASE GET MARLON WAYANS FOR A INTERVIEW!!
conan could be president lol
Conan Inspired me so much with this video that made me buy all the hot ones and burn all my family's tongues and buttholes😂
conan lost it 🙃
I cried my eyes out. Best episode!
Average Asian at Hot Ones:
Best interview ever 😂😂😂😂
Incredible.
This is Hot Ones history.
Conan is the legend. I was rolling on the floor laughing when watching this alone at home
This is the best episodes of hot one's ❤️‍🔥
Conan is the best. NBC messed up not giving him the tonight show
This episode is insane. So so entertaining. I just keep imagining Iñaki Godoy on this show promoting One Piece season two. He doesn’t take heat well 😂
after years and years, Conan has finally found a solution to fighting the burning ... just keep talking 🤣🤣
I love the “mediocre president” Simpsons reference. It was subtle, but shows they do their research.
Conan is king
This guy absouletly crazy!!! 😂
BEST ONE i have seen yet!!
Ganon f smash 21:07
this is the best one 😂😂😂
“Where did you go to medical school?”  “1998” 😂😂😂
Conan is the craziest dude ever to come on hot ones ! He's the OG !
LOOOL Conan~~ You're just too much 🤣🤣
nothing is funnier than this in internet, watching it again
He’s a mad man!
God I love Conan
Conan killed Bea Arthur
Conan is the best. no other words!
“do you mind?” *puts partially eaten chicken wing in jacket pocket
It’s time for Conan to get the Mark Twain Prize.
That was... As expected!! hahah!!
What is a Irish house😂😂😂 we love spice baby!!
Best HotOnes episode EVER
At a safari in Kenya the tour guide/ animal expert told us he’d take his chances with lions etc over having to deal with water buffalo.
What a performance , love conan!
22:48 exactly when the regret set in
That was amazing
BEST EPISODE EVER, NO WORDS, CONAN YOU ROCK!!!!!!!
Man was that impressive. I was a big fan of ‘Late Night’ and his TBS show, and he definitely had my support during the Leno controversy. He’s been a great showman and evidently that hasn’t stopped being the case. He’s outdone himself, and pretty much everyone else with this challenge. Entertaining and tough as nails.
hands down #1!!!! HANDS DOWN. None better ever.
The sheer unbridled fear in Sean Evans’ eyes really tops off the experience.
OMFG, Conan going berserk and turning the host into a guest literally  hahahahahhaah
This is a decent into madness
Conan is a beast
This is why Conan is the greatest tv host there ever was
He was very humble about spicy food and he handled it like a Latino.
One of the best interviews.
Get those scovilles going, boys!
This is Hall Of Fame
he took the pill that makes food not spicy
Conan is s straight g barbarian
Only cheese 🧀 can fix this 🫣🤭😬
I thought Conan was a bit over the top and therefore not very funny.
This isnthe greatest episode
He's nuts😂❤
Conan seems so nervous here, scrambling for control and laughs. Kind of like he said at the end. Got to give him that.
😂😂😂😂😂❤
What a performance! Just incredible!
1:41 why is no one talking about this XD
Hands down the best episode ever!!!
Easily the funniest Hot Ones episode I've seen. 🔥
I had da bomb hot sauce and yea it’s pretty hot but not extremely hot
This man is insane 😂😂😂😂
Conan owned this whole show lol but I loved it❤amazing episode😂
i would have ended the whole show on this episode. what a comedy legend.
conan would be a funky president
best episode you did ever. as always the GOAT conan teaches and shows what entertainment is all about
Wild 😂😅❤
TBF Conan’s record with animals on his show(s) isn’t great. He’s not terrified of wildlife like most late night talk show hosts but his natural indict to commit to the bit is the WRONG thing to do with wild animals. Water buffalos and reticulated pythons are not known for their wit & humor.
Conan’s absolutely hilarious and so respectful.
Honestly though the last dab isn’t that bad it’s just da bomb that gets me
This was hysterical! Conan is the king 👑
What a f*cking madman 🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😂
1 minute into the video, and I'm already laughing. Conan is a legend
Conan Obrien is a national treasure
Love him ❤
Conan O'Brien means business!! He was like I'm gonna show you show business! He made this so effortless! Love you 🫶 Conan!!!
I dont care what anyone says, Eric Andre took alot from Conan.
CMON SEAN YOU DIDNT PREPARE ANY TATTERS? CONAN IS AN IRISH, HE LOVES TATTER BERRY BERRY MUCH
"he is not the best, but he is affordable" HURRR HURRR
“The other guy” 😂
Pocket chicken
The best episode ever
Loved the compliment from Conan about the quality of the questions and interviews. Totally true and totally classy.
lol this crazy!
Waneee wanaaa
The best guest for the season end 😁❤️
This is Jim Carey on some serious steroids
Hey Conan first off you are great, you appeal to the masses as an everyman who happens to be very smart and peculiar looking. Second please inform the inexpensive Dr. Oroyo who graduated from out of state medical school the stethoscope is placed on the chest and not the tongue however I understand the good Dr. is in line for being the next Surgeon General of the US if there is a change in administrations sources say.
I think I watched him lick the last dab like 10 times, he went feral lol
20:24 the three stooges 😂😂😂😂
it's interesting how Conan complements the format and Seans interviewing ability, and then goes on to break the format and eliminate Sean as a host. I did not enjoy this performance.
Only 10 Million views. This should be top 3 on YT
You can feel the fatigue in his voice behind the character.
Met his hosting rival lol
GET KEVIN NEALON ON HERE!
Conan is a legend 😂
"This one .. I'm not gonna lie.." 😂😂
This man not flinching at the spice, and stealing chicken bones has got me rolling in my grave 💀
I'm glad Conan gave Sean a compliment for being a good journalist.  Also I didn't expect Conan to master the wing challenge but he didn't seem to have a problem with any of the sauces.  He's a trooper.
total legend .
I always liked him but now I deeply respect him
What a maniac!
Conan, a true showman!
the best one so far 😂❤
Lol, great hot ones!
I'm sure he had some ulcers after this! But none the less, Conan is epic.
Death smiled at Conan and Conan smiled back.
Oh man this should have 100 million views by now. I won’t forget where I was when I watched this for the first time.
Conan is came to assert dominance 😆Love this guy
I have proven once again that i will watch anything 😳
There was not a single hinged moment on this episode 😂
Among dozens of incredible episodes, this one takes the cake.
hahahahahahahaha............ Conan, you sir are full of it... but you're a champ hahahahahaha............
i never grew up with conan heck they dont even air his shows over here, but now i know how funny this man is wow
Conan is at his best here, truly legend
Crazy. U need to be in Hollywood. He is full fledged
conan just referring to ‘the other guy’ for leno is so perfectly petty and exactly what a rat like jay deserves
I don’t know what’s in that xperance bottle I don’t remember it being that runny
such a creep.
Who gave Conan the phat farm Jean jacket for putting his used wings in!?
That dry-cleaning bill
Conando won this show.
Anyone getting Rick Sanchez vibes here😂😂😂😂
Watching again and laughing all over 😂
X pereance isn’t over 2 million scovile it’s only 61,000 it doesn’t have a build it’s just ain’t hot
Bro had his Joker Moment 💀
I think this might be my least favorite Hot ones yet. Cant stand Conan in this shouting manner. The worst part is - he really has some good points, but the shouting and over doing it is just annoying.
They finnaly got Sean on Conan's show
Legendary
The
Im from India 25 years old, And i love all conans old shows.. Because i love how fearless & confident he is.. He is the real comedian.. Love for conan💝
Is this guy normally like this?
this is the best episode. don’t @ me
Funniest thing I've laughed at in last 10 years.  Wowsers. Ohhh how we've missed you Conan.
Favorite Episode!!!
This was epic😂😂😂😂
the champion!!
- doctor check my pulse - it's there 🤣🤣
I love Conan and always have
All-time great episode with an all-time great guest. What a ride.
Great vid The fireworks are going to in the toilet.
This is the best I've ever seen, conan an absolute boss
Conan is the BEST!!!
By far my favorite episode ever
Conan is the GOAT ❤
Lolol hilarious 😂😂😂
Haha so hilarious....he knocked it out of the park
HILARIOUS!!!!
Best episode ever❤
He’s like if the joker wasn’t evil
how does Conan know what abraham lincoln sounds like
I miss Conan on late night, i still find myself watching his gamer reviews series, some of the funniest materials on the internet.
Speechless
Best. Episode. Ever.
Anyone else watched this with their jaws dropped?
CONAN'S LAST TELEVISION APPEARANCE...HE NEVER RECOVERED
Impressive 👀 and blooming heck he’s a giant.
Heehee 🕺🏾
Conan is the realest of all real.
Wow the last talk to cameras 😂
I can't believe how much life Conan has in him, it's truly inspiring
The close up on all the wing sauces just haphazardly strewn about and tipped over at the end just SENT me! 😂😂😂
The best episode, Conan is way to funny men, you are the best mi amigo
Outta Control ! 😂🤣 😭🤣
It's gotta be when Conan chugs the hot sauce. But he maintains the Sacred Investigation with yet another one bites the dust.
Conan o Brien is by far the best hot ones guest in history. There is no one bettter.
I’ve been waiting for this since forever ❤ love you forever Conan ❤
This was beyond hilarious. Love Conan!!
Conan O'Brien is my personal hero
Conan is all powerfull.
Like a boss!
WOW 👍👍👍
Conan saved my life
Kadekai!
Anyone else getting coke head 😂😂😂
I love this Irish man! Conan's the GOAT! 🤟
What an animal!! Conan is effortlessly funny
I've seen many celebrities on Hot Ones but by far this is number 1. Kudos to Conan O'Brien. He is a true legend. *Salute*
Conan O'Brien is an absolute SAVAGE!!!! This was was F***ING GOLD!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
yeah
Sean usually takes pride in "being right here with you" ... Conan left him for dust.
Conan reminds me of Howard Beale’s speech in The Network!
This was the best episode of all time!  He set the bar to unreachable!
His wit and intellect are unmatched. No hesitation. Just went for it.
The doctor bit is hilarious
This is so entertaining 😂
I hesitated to touch my own face after this one.
Pure legend❤
My stomach literally hurts! I’m crying! Laughing so hard I’m coughing hard!  I CANNOT TAKE IT!! The Three Stooges reference 👏🏾TOOK👏🏾ME👏🏾OUT!! The end?!! Man!! I did not give  Conan enough credit! I always thought he was funny but I now have a new found respect for him!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Near the end Conan with some clown makeup would make a good joker...
Conan is an absolute animal. Bro is a showman fr
I can’t wait to watch this. 😂
“Come check my pulse… you’re just choking me”
Beast mode on them wings Iv always liked Conan
Conan is such a wit. I love this guy.
He’s cray
Ageless icon
I LOVE THIS ❤
The poured the bomb all over a wing and ate it. That was insane😮
Dr . ARROYO😂❤
Gillis could have learned from this, great job Conan!
REALLY GOOD EPISODE!
I hope they gave each other a sincere hug after they wrapped. That was some magic!
Christ this was good
Wow 😮 Respect Conan 👍🏻
When he started to open Da Bomb I was yelling at the screen.. NO  CONAN!!!! CONAAAN NOOO!!! ✋🏾
There cannot be a better episode of hot ones. I consider this the shows finale. Conan, from the depths of the either, thank you.
😂😂 this man is the best 😂😂 🔥🔥
Conan, brilliant comedic genius. Old school vibes :)
Hilarious! I needed to laugh today 🥵
There is no question that Conan is entertaining. I didn't watch late night growing up much because I was pretty young and it was past my bedtime 😅. But I caught a lot of his things on youtube later in my life. I will tune into his HBO show for sure. (Edit: not HBO but Max 😆)
I heart Conan so much!
Best of all time
Bravo Conan.
This is by far the best and most unhinged episode of hot ones!! a true legend
I don't exactly like him normally, but that was absolutely impressive. I would be terrified to get in a fistfight with him. His brain isn't right
Love that guy!! Conan is funny!!!!!!😂
Crazy Conan.
23:00
I was waiting for the doc to say "yeah, he's got 4 years left" lol
This is the funniest thing I’ve seen in the last fifteen years or so. Conan is a god.
Conan is an animal
Conan looks near death by the end
This was so freaking funny 😆 that was great!
The best episode so far, Conan is such a great guy!
Best episode ever
That was one of the best things I've ever seen in my life 😂😂😂
Greatest one to date 😂 i loved it
His face is a mess😂😂😂😂😂
this episode is top 5 all time without question. Conan O'Brien: salute you legend.
Hes my favorite talk show host and Jack Paar he was ahead of his time Jack.
Sean does his research
Rachel Ray killed it too
I love sweet and spicey hot sauce
I LOVE YOU CONAN ❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I met him twice and he was nice and down to earth.
Licking spot of sauces of the bomb is crazy, that hotsauce really hurts your mouth and he just proceeds to talk trash to the host. Conan's the best
Him covered in the food, sauce, and spit at the very end had me in tears
This is the Conan I wanted on his show hahaha
Brilliant episode absolutely brilliant!
Capsaicin is alcohol soluble. Wonder how much Conan pregamed the show. Yeah I know it don’t work that way.
They funniest show ever.
Conan is a legend.
Dayuuum straight out da bottle main! Conan don't play! didn't even flinch!! Respect !!
Conan, you are the best of the best! I love you!!!!!!!!!!
If I had been Conan I would have just started sticking the wings in my pocket no lead up or explanation. Once Sean references it a quick “ah don’t worry about it” then later call doc in after a wing and “quietly” say, “my pockets are full” put the wing in his pocket  Also I feel like there is at least one moment Sean is feeling a little frustration.
Best guest ever. This is why I was a big proponent of the “Bring Back Conan” bit.
I remember watching hot ones so early on, and it's amazing to see how far you have come and the stars you get on the show! And yes, you are a great interviewer!
Conan did your survive the next day cleanse ?
😂 I would love to see the after burn haha.
Best episode ever
Gordon Ramsey, Dave Grohl...and now Conan. New king.
The Argentina episode of “Conan must go” is probably his best work. The most I’ve actually laughed out loud in a decade.
an absolute legend
Just love Conan! ❤🙌
I never thought i could respect connan more than i already have
Is this your most watched video yet???
Foaming at the mouth 😂
Conans glass magically changes from water to milk the moment he says he’s starting to feel it.
Dear god almighty
I could do this show easily!!! There's nothing on here too hot for me. I've been homeless, living in my car for years, also spent around 8 years living/traveling in Latin America, learned Spanish from scratch at 25 years old... I have a lot of stories. Have me on the show if you're not scared.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Watching this made me want to see Conan as an Irish mobster.  I just want to see him own a room of tough guys with absurd wit.
conan, you are the best! thank you!
Fabulous. Now watch the episode of "Conan Needs A Friend" to get the subsequent fallout.
Seriously impressive through and through, what a legend!!!
Positively insane. That’s MY tv show host.
He has to keep talking to get cool air into his mouth 😂
Top 10 guest of all time!
Dude is too funny
Conan had me laughing in tears 😭😭😭😭😭 the best one ever. 😂😂😂😂 I am saving this one . 😂😂😂😂😂
Its a sad day when the great Conan O 'Brian has to demean himself to attend something like this podcast for losers ...
Max is my dogs name he loves eggs
This is the greatest episode in the history of this YouTube channel!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
22:52 the concern and borderline terror in Seans eyes after witnessing Conan drink from the last dap bottle is priceless. Then the cut to Conan red like a cartoon screaming I'm fine... I am crying this was the best episode ever.
The doctor is too funny
Conan is just brilliant, I really wish I could meet him, even if it’s a minute I know it’ll be the funniest minute of my life
I did not expect Conan O'Brien to top Eric Andre in terms of being unhinged on this show but in retrospect I absolutely should have
Wow, I've been seeing a whole bunch of celebrities take on the hot wings challenge but Conan o Brian really did the challenge like a straight up champ I would say. Just a great a big congratulations 🎉❤🏆🥇🏅 on the eating the hot wings challenge to Conan o Brian 👏, because I couldn't even imagine how hot the sauces were but I can only imagine on how hot those sauces may even get from on over here. Crazy, crazy, crazy. God bless and peace aswell. Take care. Peace. 1. 1. 💪✌️✊☮️🙏🕊️😎🤠👍🎉♥️🏆🥇🏅👌🔥💯
Bro Conan needs to do some celebrity host appearances
He is the Lisan al Gaib. He who controls the spice.
Why not just call it breaded cauliflower why call them something they aren't
I'm still sad Sean didn't contribute as much as it could to the comedy that was boiling here... I mean, think he is fantastic but I guess is not his style
The goat!!!
The actual GOAT.
Sometimes McDonalds' hot'n'spicy sandwiches give me the hiccups.  These would destroy me.
Was the doctor real or a bit?
#16:11  I absolutely love the shows…. But can the celebrities that are on here NOT use the Lord’s name in vain? I understand the different curse words, etc., but seriously… Could that just be something that people on the show not do? I just think it’s absolutely ridiculous in my honest opinion . Not that anyone cares, but still… My point remains very valid.
This guest is really good, is he a presenter or something? He should do this professionally
Well,thats his laxatives of the night. After the show I'm  sure he locks himself in the toilet😂
I can’t breathe!!!!😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Idk what it is but Conan just doesn’t come across as likable. Just cheap humor
Conan is just taking over. Amazing.
G Ramsay was my favorite for a long time, but Conan slayed. He outdid every previous guest with his crazy sauce drinking while managing to stay in the interview.
Conan is a genuine treasure, I wish all this woke bs didn’t happen, he’d still have a show. I feel like he wouldn’t bend so the show was taken.
Just shut up maniacal narcisist
Man what a tiring guesf
rachel weisz 😏
This was a fun roller coaster. It started off smooth and soft and just took off after 2 minutes and never slowed down. Love Conan.
Conan is a woke idiot.
Comedy king !
this is a real "Conan The Spicy Barbarian" 👍
Conan looks like he’s from whoville lol
No one beats CONAN 👑 This is my favorite❤
"Never saw a spice till i was 52 lol"😂😂😂 awesome interview.
How anyone thinks Conan is funny is beyond me. This comment section odds bought and paid for. No war this episode has the numbers it’s showing.
Wow Conan really did amazing. It’s extremely rare to see Sean take a back seat on his own show. Great episode.
The sauces might not have affected his taste buds. But I bet he destroyed the toilet when he got home.
Conan = Hot Ones Chap!
We need the behind the scenes of this one!
BEST HOT ONES EVER!
I'm sitting here, yelling at the screen, "No, Conan! Don't do it!!"
Sean is cringe AF these days.
I laughed so hard at da bomb that I threw my breakfast up
Always been my favorite late night host since the TBS era
No one is going to top this. Conan crushed it.
Conan for President!
Watching this truly makes me wish I could see Robin Williams so this. He is so missed.
My OCD really bothered by the fact that he had wings in his pocket
Dressed and groomed like a leprechaun... I love it😂 But, good lord could he handle those wings...
Conan O’Brien will always be f***ng hilarious
Pure fuking entertainment, amazing
Dude is 🫨😵‍💫
Never fight a redhead. They love pain.
Wow Conan you have my standing ovation 👏
Such a genius.
Conebone69
I have been watching this show since day one.. And Im a big fan.. This is my best one ever
A comedy genius. I died a little when he said “call the wife”.
Best Hot Ones EVER! 😂
I'm watching the travel show
😂😂😂
I love Conan
he is truly an aries lol
Omg…i was so anxious watching this 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Masterclass in comedic control and giving a host the interview of a lifetime.
Best Hot ones I ever watched!!! Love Conan❤
Hmmm ***Jim Carrey vibes?*** loved the pacing & OTT ending. As someone who tried a few drops of Frank's RedHot sauce on my breakfast (stomach rebelled!) while staying in Pittsburgh, PA this show is hilarious.
Best episode ever
Beast!
Conan is the new heavyweight goat of the hot wing challenge! He destroyed it!
Conan pulled a Coolio and crushed it, unlike Coolio
No one will ever top this.
GOAT
GOAT
Ive never laughed so hard in my life
Conan's great! The interviewer, though, failed to keep up--I didn't see him drinking sauce from the bottle!
what did he do with the bones
He doesn't understand the numbers killed me
Bro the steth on Sean’s tongue absolutely floored me 🤣 🤣
I feel like he’s trying to be a meme in this
Conan is Savage🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Conan O'Brien is awesome but someone needs to replace his hair stylist😖 he does not need a California super wave because Conan is not surfing his hair!😂
I ate every sauce watching along with this show bite by bite and I guarantee you, he went straight to the hospital after this.
Who can top this?!😂😂😂
Conan is the greatest guest the show has ever had
My FAVE moments 21:40💥 22:23🎆 24:27 🎆😘💖🌟✨
conan: "you cant control the future" also conan: predicts bea arthurs death
CONAN WNS IT ALL
why didn't conan flash him like Heidi Klum?
Reminds me of Robin Williams
Excellent
Conan O’Brien is an amazing host. He is one amongst many from Letterman to Leno to Johnny Carson🎉 I would agree this interview process should be taken more serious by entertainment industry. This should be on NBC and ABC as regular as any Tonight Show should be they really do their research and ask great questions. Proof of that was when I saw the Will Smith hot ones with as much going on and people taking shots at that guy, he still made it a great interview without having to go there with the interview
....could that doctor be a nod to Dr. Nick Riviera?!
Realy impressive
Wow.
GET MATPAT ON THE SHOWWWWW
Unbelievable
100% Irish genetics = alcohol and hot sauce are just water
Conans a beast.
this might be the best Hot Ones episodes of all time
conan is him
1998 is a great school to be fair
Maybe the best one. I want Daniel tosh
How long was Conan in the hospital after this episode?? Hilarious!
Love you forever Conan
He’s crazy
immediately knew this was going to be a different kind of show.
the beauty of chaos
Where did you go to medical school?  Uhhh, in 1998
He's my personal my goat when it comes to hosting.
I don't understand h, let alone not show any pain for so long. He just straight up drank hot sauce and then continues like nothing happened. It's incredible.
Conan has always been a mf GOAT.
Best Hot Ones episode yet! Never liked Leno..too snarky & condescending not funny..Letterman was good but I fwlt his shows were slow rolling & the comedy wasn't there with Paul as a sidekick always felt too rehearsed instead of off the cuff..Conan was great & if things slowed a little Andy would throw in a witty little quip to pick up the slack..great duo Conan's a consumate showman..& this SAVAGERY proves it..awsome combination of old school slap-stick, modern thought provoking comedy, with a big helping of insanity! Great show..my brand of humor for sure...but Groucho Marx is still & always will be the G.O.A.T !
I’d love to see Tom Hanks and Tim Allen on the show 😊
Best episode ever!
Conan birthed chuck norris
Best episode for sure
Conan is such an idiot...that's why he's so great. A modern Jerry Lewis.
Guests need to sit at the same table again!!!
I can't stop watching this
This was fantastic
Brought a dr. On just to flex lol. Conans the man haha
I truly enjoyed this episode ❤
Conan just got high on hot sauce .
THE MOST EPIC HOT ONES !! 🔥
Conan is honestly such a smart, witty dude...but the fact that he can find anything to laugh about in Chaucer is insane lol.
This is the best episode!!!
The last 3 wings were comedy GOLD! Conan is nnwill always be that guy!!
hands down the best episode ...better than Gordan Ramsey. Conan was a beast handling those wings. All while he stayed funny af. This shows why he is so much better then the like of john oliver who is duller than a used pencil.
Now I know what laughing hysterically means
This is the GOAT episode. It'll never be topped
This actually makes me feel like eating chicken
He survived whiskey and shootin with  hunter s thompson this was a piece of cake for conan
I love Conan.. I love Conan.
If Conan is on your show. It's his show now.
Conan is simply the GOAT of comedy such an amazing perosn
How could he not reference Max his drummer in this episode
I absolutely lost it. This is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life. Went beyond laughing into wheezing and crying.
F****** fantastic he killed it straight up love it❤😂😂😂🎉
This dude is f****** fantastic you have to give it to him. What a champion man straight up 🫡🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲❤️😎
"was it a 4  year medical school?".... "it was supposed to be" i literally laughed so hard at this
Conan is the 🐐 of talk show hosts (and my personal fave) and this Hot Ones has got to be one of the best, if not the best interviews ever
Did Conan, Bill Burr, and Will Smith all wear the same jacket on the show?
Dr Arroyo saying his temp was up 2 degrees was real. 🤣🤣🤣
The horror in Sean's voice watching Conan DUMP Da Bomb on a wing... Pure concern for his health
Conan saying "that won't make it in, no laughs there" really shows how awful modern journalism has gotten.
That's gotta go down as one of if not the best episode.   Conan understood the assignment.  Absolute gold!! 👏👏👏
I watched the episode, it's perfect. never seen Conan in this state but it was hilarious
Where'd you go to school - out of state. Feel for a pulse - it's there. was it a 4 year medical school - it was supposed to be.
This was too much man...smh
i didn't notice that conan DIDN'T COUGH AT ALL AT DA BOMB
Best Episode Ever!
This had me rolling. 😂🤣
This is one of the best entertainment experiences that I have ever witnessed.  Thank you, Sean.  Thank you, First We Feast.  Thank you, Conan.  And yes, thank you, Dr. Aroyo. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don't particularly like Conan, but I can't say I don't respect him.
As is his jovial relative crazy creativity, O'brien has elevated a show that was ALREADY FANTASTIC AND DIDN'T DISAPPOINT OR EVER GIVE QUARTER! AN ASTONISHINGLY AMAZING RIDICULOUS MAN THAT LOVES TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY AND WON'T STOP! 🙏🦄💦💕
Conan - good lord, what a trooper.
Hands down the best guest of the show
No other episode of Hot Ones can top this lol
Hands down the GOAT of Hot Ones!! 🎉🎉🎉😳😳 😳🔥🔥🔥 Brilliant!!
Conan once again proving why he is the undisputed GOAT
Conan talking about how he didn't really break out until 30 is giving me more hope for my life
That was gross.
I love these Conan skits. Good for him for giving Sean a career.
1st wing: Classic Conan 10th wing: Conan’s downfall into Joker
Does anyone know what that shot at 8:05 is from? Like who that is?
I have been watching Hot Ones since Day 1 and I can say with no hesitation that this is the BEST episode of the series! Congrats on all your success @hotones
The fact the Conan doesn't laugh a single time is just mind blowing that he can keep his composure in all that comedy!
Pure comedy gold right here
Conan is the best ever lol
Love Conan even when not trying he gave great wisdom
Props Conan that was truely a great performance
I still come back to watch this episode months later
Dude, easily top three episode haha genius
Anyone knows the name of the epic music that starts at 19:27 ?
I haven't watched this show in a long time.  But this has to be one of the best guests ever!!!
His sheer disdain for the Max rebrand is wonderful
One of the best episodes. Much respect to Conan what a legend
This is my third time watching
Why he say it like that, u don’t have to talk to him talk to me👀💀bruh if I was that doctor 👀
Best episode yet.
I really liked Dr. Arioyo, he was really funny and quick with that "I should be". I'll bet he's really funny
I'M PERFECTLY F*CKING FINE! 🤣
Sean was scared!
How can one love Conan any more?  Thx FWF!
Charlie Rose with hot wings 🤣
The best episode of Hot Ones, ever. 😂😂😂
lol its there!
Pocketing the wings is mentally diabolical lol!
The best show O'Brien what a good sport
After that performance I'd give him four years tops...
Conan is a ballsy SHOWMAN!! BRAVO GOOD SIR!!
The end is a full Rick and Morty moment
Conan Obrian is a show business pro! HURTS to watch!!! UGH😮😮😮
I genuinely cant tell if he's just unaffected like my roommate (she buys buldak sauce-the super spicy korean hot sauce-by the bottle) or if he's just that professional and committed to giving a good show
since this ive been rewatching everything conan to this day
They should get Jared Keeso on Hot Ones!
8:30 this is so deep, respec to Conan Also the ending is epic
I'll say it, I've just revisited the conan via satellite scetches. From like late 90's to 2000's and its just primo comedy. Conan truly was ahead of his time, and as such he really invented the modern talk show and modern talk show topical humour. His semi-psychedelic semi-oldschool comedy just brings peace and on-edge at the same time.  Its just perfect. I'm saddened it didn't get grip on mainstream us tv, but it will guide in a whole new generation of tv and entertainment. This from a eastern european from Estonia who watched Monty python flying Circus and oldschool Conan in succession.  But seeing many office-approved guys fail, seeing Leno fail, I have a feeling, Conans style and whacky humour will prevail!
That was amazing
🤣🤣🤣🤣👍🏼
This is what Hot Ones is all about. 😂
best episode by far. Conan has a beast mentality
Conan is the best. lol
This is THE BEST Episode EVER!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉CONAN...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This man truly does it for the Vine like nobody else
Conan King of hot wings
Meh too stagey
Can tell Conan liked Sean. I bet he’s very judgmental about doing random interviews too 😊
This was hilarious
That "Aaahh-whoooo!" was the pepper high kickin' in! 😂😂😂
I’m rewatching Conon and Sean. I will keep rewatching this episode.
This is the first episode that genuinely made me laugh out loud. BEST EPISODE YET.
Best one yet!
12:32 Vladimir O'Brian.
Best Hot Ones Episode of All Time
By FAR the best episode
Oh man! I'm from India and I died watching him drink the sauce. Legend
🐐🐐🐐🐐
this has to be the greatest performance Hot Wings has ever seen (that's saying incredible things...)
That's an all timer interview
And a voice just said "Do Hot Ones!".
wow .. true show man !!
The day the show fought back
Had a braveheart speech feeling the whole time.
One of the best episodes
This is commercials interspersed with 2 minutes of content.
The ice...broke me.
Was so not expecting Conan to crush these wings like he did 😂
Lord I can't stand this guy and couldn't make it past the first few minutes. Is it an American thing? He keeps shouting over Shawn and saying it's cool to be dumb
There will *NEVER* be a better episode than this.
23:00  I'm fine...I'm perfectly f**ing fine😂 Peak comedy 😆
Incredible
We will never get to experience Chris Farley on hot ones but I kinda feel like I did just experience it 😂
Conan is a true legend!🎉😅
Presidential candidates should be forced to do an interview with hot ones
Conan is a legend
There's committing to the bit and then there is Sean doing Conan's show for years
The funniest hots ones ever hahaha hehehe 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This man Is a monster 😂
Love Conan!!
BEST. EPISODE. EVER.
21:14 chris Farley was laighing here
Goats good and all. But this guy is an icon
"Youre getting the greatest show in the world" it boils down to passion kids
And, he's so right .. old comedy is really funny.🎉😂😊
Game over. Conan won.
New wanee wanaa just dropped 📢
Conan is such a legend
Best ever! I love Conan 🤣
by far the best one, thats a man right there
Is this the first "wing drop"!?
The heat didnt go to his stomach it went straight to the brain 😭😭🤯
His tongue can't detect capsaicin
Конан по-настоящему безумен! Джорджу Миллеру нужно было снимать новый фильм с ним в главной роли вместо Ани Тейлор-Джой.  А эпизод можно выкладывать на PornHub.
Well done sir🤣🤣
My favorite moment?  The whole interview!
Best one ever
CONAN IS THE MAN!!!!
I let my two year old watch this with me and he started crying every time they showed Conan's face at the last two sauces
This one will be tough to follow, what a complete professional funny man.
Hahhahahahaaa LEGEND !!!!!
4th time watching this - still absolutely hysterical and brilliant 🎉
When he drank the hot sauce 🤣🤣🤣
"What's wrong with me?Why can't I feel?"I died and came back to life to write this
Is Conan also doing a one up to bill burr? They both had a very similar intro statement, wore almost the same denim jacket and then Conan just went berserk 😂. Legendary episode
By far has to be the best hot ones yet
Conan is a real professional. He felt the spicy but just decided not to let it affect his performance
You should go “ 😂😂😂😂😂
“Max” is still such a dumb name. 😊
Hands down the best ep of hot ones I have ever seen
Conan is the exact type of white man that conquered and colonized the world.
lovely to see a nordic president on the show!
I was worried he’d be another Alton Brown…This was the most deranged guest. I know it’s partially acting (right?) but it’s so funny either way.
THE GOAT
Love him so much
Why was his milk almost gone and then 1 second later it was full?
What’s wrong with me, why can’t I feel?? 😂
Oh my god I'm laughing so hard, I'm dying 😭
Exactly how I imagined partying with Conan would be like.  Fantastic. Best tasting ever!
Lol after da bomb Conan was hiiiigh AF  he got hot sauce high
He's not a good doctor. He's an affordable doctor 😂😂
I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Conan's the king.  😅 👑
Sona and Jordan next
Every guest should take the Conan challenge
The guy is not funny at all
"WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?! WHY CAN'T I FEEL!?" The laugh after this sent me to heaven, I told God the joke He laughed so hard He sent me back to continue my purpose. Conon O'Brien is still one of the funniest humans alive! HALL OF FAME BEST EPISODE OF ALL TIME! Grew up watching this LEGEND!
I haven't laughed that hard in a while. Thank you Conan 😂
the goat
New high water mark.  Conan did not disappoint
I forgot Conan's energy levels were this high hahahah
sean is human civilization and conan is more like covid o brien here
Conan and Bill Burr are two white boys I wish I chilled with!
Conan is an absolute legend!
I love how Conan balances being funny/joking and  giving serious, sincere answers to Sean's questions. He has an effortless flow to the way he talks  and conducts himself.
The real question is what is he going to do with the pocket wings? Snack for later? Lab analysis? Only the good doctor knows … or the wing mic drop    Great episode, probably one of the best!
I cant tell if Conan is actually in pain or not lol
Dude is a lunatic lol
Put the bones in his pocket... 4 later
I love Conan so much, I have always admired him incredibly on how quick he can be hilarious on the spot. Also what a beast he demolished all sauces !!!
Why is he keeping half eaten wings in his pocket 😭😭😂😂
I knew!!! I knew I loved Conan for a reason ❤️ thanks for another smile and laugh 🥲
One of the best episodes 😂
Conan, the last truly great late night host.
nah this was disgusting
Legit the number 1 performance on Hot Ones Conan is incredible still dialed in and able to entertain relevantly at his age
"What's wrong with me? Why can't I feel?"
Conan really brought a doctor skit for this video. amazing
Hes not a good doctor, hes an affordable doctor 😂
What a legend !
Best guest ever!
Nobody…fckn NObody goes harder than Conan
Conan OWNS comedy. He is the GOAT.
Water buffalo wild wings
What control over matter—what a Pro
This gotta be the best episode so far.  The only person I really want to see on next is David Goggins. STAY HARD
It’s called being a man.
I wasn’t sure if I was gonna die first from laughing or Conan.😂🤣😂 This is the most funniest episode for me, and it tops the recent Will Smith interview. Conan and Will are legends in their own ways.🙌🙌🙌
This guy was huge in my childhood the episodes he wrote for the simpsons are my favorite and now my kids I’m so glad to see this guy hasn’t lost anything
Guy skipped the bomb.
Increíble!!!
Genuinely so excited. I love Conan
SO CHEVY CHASE IS CONAN'S HEAD WRITER NOW? Not sure why  I wrote this in caps...
Such spices are toxic.
Is it too much to ask to have a best friend like him?! He’s awesome.
Absolute legend
This is so good I can't stop re-watching Conan's GLORY
Never saw a spice until 52 is crazy! Also, does Conan have taste buds???
Jesus Christ.
Ok ...this is the greatest and best episode EVER!!!!!
I don't care, conan is the greatest talkshow host of all time
WHATS WRONG WITH ME, WHY CAN'T I FEEL!?
bro fear of leaving his DNA behind in case they do what? Is that why he’s putting the bones in his jacket? 🤢
How did the whitest guy do this with this much ease?!?
Excellent
I laughed so hard
That was by far the best Hot Ones in my opinion.  I have never seen anything like this
The best!
WING DROP 😂❤
Conan's complexion just gets redder as the interview progresses.  And his pocket gets more and more full. ;) This is the 2024 equivalent of Conan jumping on a buffalo.  So good!
I Absolutely love Conan. The man has more energy now, than I did at 25.
Conan is a timeless natural treasure
Dudes self ovation at the end was GOLD!!! 😂😂 man I just finished watching all!! Of Hot Ones man I love it!!! By the way it would have been LEGENDARY If all he did at the end was Flip The Bird, grabbed a sauce bottle and drop it like a mic as he left
Dudes self ovation at the end was GOLD!!! 😂😂 man I just finished watching all!! Of Hot Ones man I love it!!!
Conan is the only one who talked the talk and walked the walk when taunting the wings of death. What a performance. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This was the first and last time hot ones was entertaining
Conan went full Maya Rudolph 😭
I am rewatching, I just wish I could like the video twice
By far the funniest episode in hot ones history..Conan is an undiscussed legend
This is one of the greatest moments of YouTube, Conan brought his A game, Sean rose to the challenge and wow - just wow!!!
"Can I keep this?" *puts half eaten chicken wing in pocket*
BEST HOT🔥 ONES INTERVIEW PERIOD!!!! my guy did not disappoint  CONAN is THE FCKIN MAN💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Bryan Cranston and Conan have the same eyes!
Sean is like he is facing his first ever job interview of his life😂
Insane  🤣🤣🤣
Best episode 💯
HOW DID CONAN DO ALL THAT, OH GOD
Conan Is a menace 😂😂😂
Stand and deliver oh god, what a legend and at last the wise words from the goat, kudos conan, everything for a show, as you said the show is for entertainment.
Can we get Steven Seagall on Hot Ones?
😂 doesnt want to leave his DNA or what ??  Stacking bones in his pocket 🤣
conan is a legand luv that guy
One of the best 👌  shane gillis gotta bring it
Conan is ridiculous in the best way. 😂
what an absolute legend conan o brien
Great show
When someone makes a psychological profile on Conan, they'll use this video.
That was insane!!! Great show
I bet the fireworks were the next day in the bathroom
is connan huge? or sean tiny?
😂😂❤
21:34 the look he gives conan 😂
This is great great show.  Love it.  😂
This is a flat masterpiece. I am in awe.
No tears or heart-attack. Impressive.
That's a haircut right there.
Anything for the show
Y'all peaked.  You will never top this until you bring him back for a sequel.  😆🤣😭☠️🪦
I wonder if Dr. Arroyo accepts PPO's
O'Brien isn´t funny! This would have been funny if someone had poured the hottest sauce in his eyes! That would be funny!
he is the king
This wa the weirdest and best episode I've ever seen. It was great pure entertainment.
I love this guy
Man do I miss Conan, true comedy at its peak.
This is the most legendary episode of all time. Absolutely goated.
Thank Mr. Sean Evan. Conan was what this show needed
He lost the plot😅😅😅😅😅😅
Ok conan its 3 years for medical school not 4 you went to Harvard i would think you would know that
Are you f kidding me!!! That was impressive
Dude is insane lol
Epic
I almost gagged a few times there. :/
Conan is a comedy god
Greatest Hot Ones ever. I can’t believe it took me this long to get to it
The guy is immortal, Conan went for broke on the show! Conan O'Brien, officially Mexican!
Bro quoted Popeye! Such a great man! I have to say, I flinched when he drank and poured a lot of hot sauce... That has to feel really bad.
Can we have Mike Tyson for the wings :D
I've never seen this guy before, he's so painfully unfunny to me. I'm cringing. Do people find him funny?
conan is not white on the inside 😄
Conan closed the season with literally the biggest of mic drops. He's an absolute gem.
fake they water down the sauce per each person that is on the show
It was hard to watch at times 😂😅
The headline should have been Conan loses his mind while eating Hot Wings 😅😅😅
By far my favorite episode. I love Conan. That crazy mother fluffer.
10M views as of 06.09.2024. Conan has to come back sometime soon for another chaotic episode 🤣
Best ever
this might be the best ep
Conan releasing his inner Rick Sanchez by the end of the show!  That was great!
conan is so wicked
Acts like a maniac then immediately drops real knowledge on us. Conan is the GOAT
Conan  you are a funny crazy  dude 😅😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💪👏👏👍
i laughed i cried
Conan is so mental yet so entertaining 😂😂😂
My goodness this was insanity genius!
I’ve never seen Conan so real
Straight boss!
Dr Arroyo started medical school in 1998, Conan says he been working for him for 25 years. So basically he hired him in his second year of college💀
Love Conan. Truly the best of our generation.
I was already cracking up in the first 2 minutes hahahaha
Definitely one of best episodes! Conan rocks!!!
CONAN & SOUTH PARK have kept me alive
Absolutely legendary 😂😂😂
"CALL THE WIFE!!!!"😂
Jordan Schlanksy brought me here
I haven’t laughed this hard in years. As if we needed more evidence Conan is a comic genius, we got it in spades.
He should play the joker
One of my favorite human beings on the planet 😂
Conan likes to party ❄❄❄
Ein Freund wollte ma lustig sein, der hat 3 Stunden gekotzt,... Das ist nicht witzig mit den Sosen,... Da giebt es echt schlimme,..
HE maybe the greatest guest of anything all time. Dude is just amazing funny and he doesn't even try.
Legend!!!!!!!
real funny too funny
By far and away the absolute best Hot Ones ever!
Conan is NOT human!!!! 🤣  Hope he doesn’t get any in his eyes!
It's JUST starting!!   as his nose is running and face is glistening
Dont really know who this Irish guy is but hes so funny!
The greatest hot wings devourer since Coolio, my god.
Best show ever!!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤
I feel bad for the guest who has to follow this masterpiece.
This might be my favorite episode ever. Definitely among the funniest.
Coco yes 😅😂🤣🤭🤭😁🍗🥛🍦🧊😎🥵🥵Have a good day and night positive vibes 🤍🖤🤍☕️
One of the all time best episodes of this show, hands down! Conan is a genius. 👏👏👏
💥❤️💥😁🤗😇
The dude is an amazing person.
Best ones so far
Conan, what a barbarian.
That was the most unhinged episode ever. I was covered in tears by the end. Conan is beyond a shadow of a doubt the GOAT.
Comedy is his Super Power.
brilliant. still not subbing to a new service.
Can't imagine doing Coca-Cola with Conan...🤯
Never get old Conan. This is what will happen if you put 2 great host in one show.🤣
Is this the real Rick Sanchez?
This is what True Showmanship looks like 👏👏
This is my fav hot ones of all time
OK what we learned is you do not mess with Conan while he's putting on a show
🤣🤣🤣
He is one of a kind. I hope he scrubbed his hands before he touches himself.
I miss Conan
22:39
Really good episode
very good.
Fantastic.. my fav eps i must say.. conan is really macho
The spicier the sauce, the drunker he gets. Man i love conan's comedic act😂😂😂
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
One month later and I'm still thinking about this episode
I never liked Conan.  By the end. I had a new hero.
How many times have you been back to watch this?
That was ny favorite so far
“What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I feel?” 😂😂😂😂
He said… “what’s wrong with me, why can’t I feel?”  Mf legend.
I think Conan wanted to help this show. He has genuine respect for Sean's interviewing!
The best episode
He's soooo Irish. My lord.✊️
"CALL THE WIFE!!!!"🤣
The doctors eyes 😂, Conan cracks me up.
Someone please tell him the worst is yet to come. He'll wish tomorrow never comes. Talk about burning twice.
Was that his hair on fire? 🔥🔥🔥
CONAN once again beast mode!!!
that was hilarious... best episode in awhile and holy he made Sean look like a kid at the end lol
Why am I just now seeing this. EPIC. EPIC. 20:55 I am in complete awe. 😆
get seth meyers
Conan set the bar in this episode.
He reminds me of Coolio
What an absolute ANIMAL! Love Conan
Something is wrong
How did we go from arguably one of the best shows ever to that has been who slapped chris rock?
Bringing your physician on with you is such a flex nobody’s talking about! Lol.
Who here after watching the Dj Callie fail 😂😂😂
Absolute disaster. I love it, might be the best episode of all time in my opinion.
When Dr. Arroyo checked Shean’s tongue 👅 and said “it’s not good” I lost my s**t 🤣🤣🤣
Best episode ever made, Conan much respect to you sir. I never laughed so hard in my life. Comedy genius.
The descendance to complete chaos was just beyond entertaining xD
This man is a true Legend.
Conan been around long time. I have to say they went easy on him. Those scovilles were LOWWW compared to some of the other guests.
This is probably my favorite episode ever. I never really liked Conan, but this episode really showed me how much of a comedy legend he is.
Incredible….giant episode 😂
Best episode period
I challenge Conan to come back and drink da bomb hot sauce instead of spilling it all over the table. Or all wings da bomb hot sauce. For him you gotta raise the bar 🍸
Sean couldn't get a word in, but he didn't have to: when Conan's in full swing, you just sit back and watch the magic. Absolute genius of escalation, an episode for the history books.
Conan took all my spice tolerance- he’s the reason I can’t eat spicy food
GOAT
Always been a fan of conan. That man proved he is a beast lol
Super star!..full stop!
the one bottle knocked over just spilling 😂😂😂😂
man went home to mount his wife 😂😂😂😂
This episode proves Conan's genius, a genuine soul AND A GAWD DAYUM MASTER IN FRONT OF A CAMERA
go to 16:30 and watch at 2x speed. trust me
Conan is up there with Letterman for me as the greatest talk show host ever
What a great guest. He brought it 110%!
I have only been waiting for this episode for 23 seasons. It's your turn Jordon!
Fake.
i LOVE Conan!!! 💕💕💕
He did just moderately better than DJ Khaled.
Conan is a boss!
Best so far
Conan emphasizing this whole water buffalo story to explain the time they had to cut him out of jeans
I LOVE CONAN!!!!   I miss his show..  But, this was fking awesome! HOT ONES!!!   😛🤣🤣🤣❤‍🔥💯
My favorite moment? When it was over. It has to be said though: I have never seen anyone with their head so far up their own behind eat chicken wings.
Conan is THE HOT WING FINAL BOSS!!!
BEST HOT ONES EVER!!! Haven't even watched the last dab yet! ♥ CONAAAAAAAAAAAN!!!!!!! This is why he is our KING ♥
Why is he such a bad interviewer 😭 😭 😭
I only watch Conan I swear to god he is the man
This was so chaotic in the best way 😂
Conan should do more voice acting
I met conan one time in the San Francisco airport waiting in line at a coffee shop. He was awesome. It was in 2013 during the heyday of TBS Conan.
Maybe the best episode ever <3
I never heard Sean be so speechless/in pain that all he say is “NUMB”!! 😂😂22:27
The is the beat episode ever 🙌  I miss Conan bro.
incredible
This is why Conan will always be the 🐐
I have loved Coney for over 15 years. I am still griping about the whole late night scandal.
Best episode and it's not close
I definitely want to see him back on hot ones again asap I loved this episode it was by far one of the best episodes it made me laugh so much I cried lol😂
One of the funniest things I've watched in a long time!
Conan is an absolute monster. He absolutely killed it.
Warning: Conan went to a place where, for the first time ever, even Sean couldn't follow.
This has to be the best episode in the show
I love Conan… he surely didn’t disappoint taking Letterman’s place.
Conan has to be the funniest man alive
Conan,one great entertainment
Best show Canon.he never fails to make me laugh
How can I respectfully question whether Conan had his tongue numbed for this episode to put on a great show?
i think there was some coconut oil doused on his tongue, prior to the show :p
I am proud to say that I rewatched this so many times and I was instrumental in getting this video to 10 million views.
Conan Completely Conquered this show. EPIC Inspiration!
Legend
Someone needs to check on Conan in a month.  This can't end well!
Why are they seated so far apart now?
Walking that fine line between comedy and insanity.
Wow.  Impressive
I loveeee it 😅😅 so funny! As a mexican I know I cannot try those sauces lol 😅 he is amazing, I loved this episode ❤❤❤
First person with some real ballz. Conan is a true entertainer
Conan pocketing those wing bones was just good ol hilarious nonsense. Love it.
It’s been a while since the Mila Kunis episode - if you know, you know.
This was their best episode of all time. Love connan!!!
This is by far the best season finale, episode ever
Conan is a beast!
Unc trippin
This was beyond incredible
I was never interested in watching his shows on TV but now I’m heading to MAX to check it out. He absolutely rocked! The best episode!!!
Next to Gordan Ramsay, by far the funniest interview! Never seen Sean at a loss for words! The drinking of the last dab!!! holy fire in the hole batman!
😬
He's absolutely insane. Incredible!
This guy is a menace
I’ve never seen some one do that to da bomb
Conan is an animal love it!!! Excellent
It was like having Creed from The Office on. Legend.
I think he was hoping for a heart attack... 😂😂 literally crying and and saying "i don't feel anything".
Conan is so unhinged here and it’s great 😂😂
I’ve watched Conan for 30 years and today he convinced me he is a true madman!!!!!
10M views wow!
I'll buy every bottle of sauce that appears on this show, in perpetuity throughout the universe, if you get Craigy Ferg on the show.
That was amazing!!! Tell me Conan was the most insane guest you've ever had ?!?!?!? 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best hands down.
that has got to be THE most memorable episodes of Hot Ones I've ever seen!!  lol.. You've got to love Conans zany antics!!! great season finale!!
🤣🤣🤣
This has to be the best episode ever
😂😂😂😂😂 savage love it the real hot ones champ 🌶🌶🌶🔥🔥🔥
His intestines are now mush.
to get a compliment from Conan on interviewing skill must have meant the world to Chris
So cool of Conan O’Brien to interview Sean Evans on his show Hot Ones.
This was an inspirational journey
The best episode ever and yes, I’m completely biased. Absolute Legend.
Did Conan win Hot Ones?  Yes
Great show....I truly enjoyed every minute of this....... thank you for what you do, you're amazing at it!
Kinda awkward, uncomfortable and forced. Idk..hard to watch for me but pretty impressive how he guzzled that sauce.
This ruined Hotones for me. How can I go back to watching boring celebrities eat wings and whine about the spice after seeing Conan simply destroy? Other celebs just can't compete with Conan the GOAT
Absolutely the best one ever!  Conan slayed it
Fkr takes a sip jesus christ 😂
Usually Sean mirrors what the guest is doing with the wings ... this time he was wise enough not to :D
Conan toughest Entertainment alive
He’s the very best episode of all. I love this guy.
Conan got high AF from those bottles 😂
it's like a francis bacon painting.
The height difference at the end caught me off guard so much. I didn't know Conan was built like that 😭
This video validates the "There will never be another Conan'O Brian" video. Conan is the greatest guy show biz could have ever gotten
Not just a certified genius and legendary comedian, but a beast whose dedication to a bit surpasses mortal pain thresholds ^^;;
What a fv<king legend! 😂🤣😂😍
Legend!
30 deconds in and sean is already sniggering. Shame there's not b roll footage of the crew. Can hear them cracking up in the background as well.
As an Irishman, I was fully expecting him to turn the brightest red I've ever seen. And nothing? Is he broken?
Disappointed you were supposed to match what he does, but I didn’t see you drinking from the bottle! 😂😂 Conan is crazy!!
You should try an episode where the wing sauces are in random order! That be for an interesting episode
This was one of the best episodes of Hot Ones ever. 😂😂
Funk me but that was insane Conan out did everyone who's ever been on this challenge
I love Conan.  <3
I'm soo glad Conan has stayed relevant this long
Conan is a mad man
Best Hot Ones yet!
conan wax coated his tongue like homer simpson.
Best guest yet! I absolutely adore Conan! Great guy, great comedian!
Love Conan! This was a good one 🖤
This was the best
I am fkn affraid of Conan now!
Wow Conan was really great. Sorry that I didn't expect him to be. Nice !
What A Legend!
This is what America was made of, suffering through it, acting like its fine and teaching everyone else that it ain´t as hard as it is. Right now Americans can´t even speak since their buttplugs are scratching the back of their throats.
Just noticed "Dr Ro Royal" in the video chapter break down 7:30 🤣
I need this episode to win an emy
Conan : Beyond Insanity
He literally said he didn't had any spice until he was 52 😭
Best episode ever.
Wow!! Best performance to date!!
This was so intense that I thought it was 10 minutes long, not 27 minutes, amazing, totally of the rails, Conan destroyed the system.
That….was….LEGENDARY!
Dude is a straight savage
In the Enc Conan is just pure RABIES
Who ?
There really is no point in continuing the show now. No one will ever top that.
That was a wild ride.
amazing!
I deleted my original comment because I had imbibed a bit more than I thought before posting my slushed comment.  Taking a YouTube video personally is idiotic.  @alexa.9923 - You response was spot on to my original post.
I think he took that secret fruit thing that makes sour things sweet, and spicy things not spicy. I forget the name but it was on shark tank. hahahah I feel like Conan would do that
Hilarious! I love Conan 😂😂😂😂😂
Effing A! This man is epic 😂
Makes me want to see Lewis Black on the show.
Stomach cramps laughing so much!
Boy, he is sick af.
🐝🏁 This is the best episode yet🤣💀💣🤑🥵😵‍💫😖😤😤😤🤢🤢🤮🤮🤠🥵
I think Conan just created an alternate reality in his where the hot sauces are just different types of ketchup 😂
What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I feel?!
Not only Conan understands the concept, he went to fully exceed it
BEAST!!!!!!!
Conan: Where did you go to medical school? Dr Arroyo: Uh, in 1998.
That's an entertainer right there
20:16  Sean saying "Don't do it" is like Scarecrow asking Batman to stop shooting fear toxin into his face because it's having no effect.
Loud does not equal funny.
Despite how the networks treated him, Conan will be remembered as a television legend.
That as THE BEST HOT WINGS EVER!!!!!!!!!!
What's up with the music.. it would be much better without. 😮😮
lol I thought he was or going to 🥵 Or simply tell that all was a lie
THE WORLD OF ENTERTAINEMENT CAN ONLY GO DOWN HILL FROM HERE THERES NO WHERE UPWARDS TO GO FROM HERE THE BEST OF THE BEST
Just the greatest ever
Gold
yay 10 million views, the man deserves nothing less
Thank you for letting each other talk and not interrupting. I could actually listen to this.
Conan has a new show means  Jordan has a job again
legend!
That noise and face at 25:40 ...  Conan is too good for the late night audience. What a treasure.
I'm 42 so you know I like me some Conan. Goat!
This guys a legend.A true actor
Conan hit a certain age and just stopped aging, hes going to look exactly same in the 20 years and it is a very conan thing of him
Conan is in beast mode 😂😂😂
Greatest video on inter-webs. Whoever disagrees, I shall put on one of those sauces up your ...
thats disgusting to look at
Definitely had true terror in his eyes once he finally ate the really hot stuff.
I swear to god conan is one of the best things that happens to this world
This is actually pretty funny 😆
Pure gold 😂
Dj Too many buffets ate 4 wings and ran 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love Conan ❤
"my pocket's getting full." "oh yes." _puts wing in labcoat_ 😂
Best show on hot ones ever
I absolutely cannot believe he poured the hot sauce on like that. That is inSANE!
Conan is not funny.
Why can’t I feel?   Me wondering the same thing
this is why i love him
Top 5 best episodes
So funny.  Thankyou
Conan is a national treasure
This has got to be the funniest Hot Ones yet HAHAHAHA
"Was it a four-year medical school" "It was supposed to be..."  XD
best episode of all time.
Conan is Legendary. Underestimated. Best fkn Comedian ever, and been in the game forever.
When you give an Irishman spice for the first time, haha 😂. Love it. Them Irish boys wild!
did a wing drop.  That should be the new tradition.
did that doctor anesthetize his mouth?
i love conan.... but that was kinda weird... even for being conan ^^'
It’s a shame Conan didn’t write the Guatemalan insanity pepper episode.
I mean the guy got kicked onto a concrete floor by a water buffalo and walked away, whats's some hot sauce gonna do?
😳Whoooaa!!  That's Next LeveL!  It's shamefully  Hilarious, watching your   guests  come unglued!😆🤭  Conan knocked  it  outta da park!💥
Good guy double-dipped.
Strange way of saying you value life; keep it in your pocket <3
- - - You look like an Oompa Loompuh.
If anyone was going to steal the show it was going to be Conan
conan is so well spoken
FKN HILARIOUS!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 LOVE CONAN! ❤
That was so a lot of
We do not deserve Conan. What a gift
Screams through da bomb lol!
2 min in and he puts it in his pocket! Dear god I'm crying laughing !
This is the BEST Hot Ones Episode!!! Thanks Conan
My favorite episode so far Sean. Thank you both!
Absolutely legendary.
Conan really raised the bar for other guests past and future.
He is a comedic genius! 😂❤
Conan the GOAT
I NEVER would of thought Conon of all people would take the crown for taking the HEAT the best.
It's... cringe
One of the best episodes ever
Wow amazing episode - might be the best one to date
Can they sit at 1 table again?
❤Your amazement at his insanity.  The best one ever.
He is probably a genius but god he is so tiring
Holy cow this one definitely tops the Gordon Ramsay episode.  Conan is a LEGEND!!
WHAT THE HECK I JUST WATCHED!!!?? 😁🤩🤩🤩 BRILLIANT, Full of LIFE and humor, made my day! 💛💛💛
Where did you go to medical school?? In 98... "WHERE???" 😂😂😂😂 Out of state.... "you should go" 😂😂😂
Born to entertain!
I’m feeling the hot sauce just watching this.
Is conan's real name by chance Tin Tin
disgusting
Conan always knocks it out of park and is the one running to go cath it😅😅😅
amazing... just amazing. One on the greatest shows ever. Conan forever.
Maybe noone ever commits to a bit like Conan...Will Farrell is good company for sure though
The GOAT taking on da bomb like a boss. what an absolute chad
BEST HOT ONES EPISODE EVER!!!
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅❤❤❤❤❤😝🤓🤓🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Absolute madlad 😂
Conan THE LEGEND 🔥❤‍🔥🔥
IMMENSE!
Conan is the GOAT!
wow, he smashed it hahaha
I love Conan!
Hahaha   when he does it with Da Bomb   ' oh its just starting to peek through '     and seans just omfg.
Hahahaha
That moment when you remember Kevin hart’s episode
This is the most EPIC hot ones ever. There’s no topping that. Conan is a Legend 🫡
This was a masterpiece. Given to us by the Maestro himself. I’d say more,but I’m still too busy laughing
The best funny man on earth no matter what is doing
Best guest to date
Drank the Last Dab from the bottle… That is freaking mental.
Conan is our Letterman.
Can I keep these 😂
Still the goat. Never fails to make me laugh even after 30 years.
I wouldn't be surprised if one of Conan's child hood heroes was the Joker. This guy is chaos incarnate!
Team Coco!!
In 1998 🙂
23:00 My mental state after watching the News on the last week of May 2024
I do a wing drop 😅😅
Conan and Shia are the best guests by far!
Conan is a madman ! Living Legend ❤ 😂
One of the best episodes ever
The clarity he still has while dying from spicy wings is next level.  Conan is a beast, the ate those wings and any other guest before him
that's the superpower you get when you're a redhead and 100% pure irish
Fucken awesome!
The guy is such a bad interviewer. He sounds like he memorised a script. I think he actually did.
The became interdimensional cable really fast
The best 27 mins of my life😂.  His podcast brought me here!!
GOAT
He's so entertaining that this felt like 5 minutes
Conan is just the coolest!
Was he on coke or something?
The best episode hands down 🫡
Just how did this guy beat every wing and spice?
Conan You LEGEND!!!
I NEED THE BEHIND THE SCENES!! N WE NEED IT NOW! CONANS THE GOAT
CALL THE WIFE!!!! 💀 😂😂
Conan the hot spice mad man 😂😂
conan wins the hot ones tolerance
This is literally the best Hot Ones Show ever. Noone has done it better!!!
If DJ Khaled is the "bottom" of the Wall of Shame then Conan is the King of the Wall of Fame, Hot Ones is perfectly balanced now for all others must fall between them.
in all the world i would of never guessed conan o'brien would be the one to break sean xD
Okay, so Conan is suicidal for the sake of comedy XD
What did you Expect? he gets SunBurnt watching Fireworks!
God hes still alive 😭
Hands down THE BEST episode ever!! 😂😂 Laughing till my stomach hurts!!
Conan is GOAT
This is by far the best episode to date and there have been a ton of really great ones. A tip of the hat to Conan and Sean.
Dude this was a perfect episode!!  My respects to Conan, that was isane!!😂😂
probably the worst hot ones episode. so cringe
THE BEST ONE
Master shake vibes
😂
Best.. hot ones... ever.
His taste buds are dead!
Gotta say, watching grown men acting like 12 year old boys, soooo desperate to get a laugh, are just sad to me... this guy and his manic antics are just not funny.
Conan is a true psychopath ❤❤❤ I love it
The Best Episode
This was sooo insane! I loved it!😅😅😅❤❤❤
I miss him during late night
ppl are so caught up with fake authenticity these days that they dunno what to do with pure talent anymore
Conan is hands down the funniest one EVER!😂
I was legit worried that he was gonna purposefully rub some sauce in his eyes
I watched Chris Hemsworth before this one and Conan obliterated him. What in the world! 😂
Dude did coke before the show obviously numb to everything lol
Best one yet, ever!
Who knew Elon Musk was so crazy!? lol
He either does a lot of drugs...or is so intense he doesn't need too.  Also poor Shaun
10/10
GREATEST HOT ONES EPISODE
Conan was my fave late nite show ever. Miss that show
This might be the funniest Da Bomb moment ever. I’m dying laughing.
😂when he said it’s not gonna stop. And when he licked it, I said 😳. Love the wing drop! He gotta be the first to bring a bootleg doctor on.
This was beyond anything i could've dreamed.  I thought Conan could not top his Afrobeats song,  but this duo will go down in history.  Thanks for one of the best and funniest distractions from regular life
MAX is the dumbest name for an HBO streaming service.  They might as well have called it "Showtime".
Well done Conan :D
I love Conan o Brien
Incredible
intensee
Probably the best episode, yet..
Im sk happy to live in a time where Conan creates
Conan looks like a zombie! 😂😂😂
Dubai was littttttttttttt
No idea why people watch Conan O'Brien, he's never once been funny. He just seems like an idiot clown staring at the camera going "laugh with me! I'm funny.... Right?" while never saying anything actually funny.
Conan is the GOAT
CONAN A BOSS!!!!!!!!! LOL!!!! HA!!! HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!
Pretty graphic footage. Almost puked just watching it
This show is just great.  It’s become one of the great interview shows of all time and Conan was spot on with his compliments to Sean.  Sometimes something hits different and I always find myself liking the celebrity as well as being a little happier afterwards.  As far as the episode, Conan was about as good as it gets on every level and he dominated those sauces.
Showman will showman
At 22:53, Sean looks legitimately terrified
Man I'm I really love conan really respect him
This is a major wow episode! The fact that Conan drank hot sauce, applied a bit on his face, It is truly amazing how you could still understand him as he did not mumble. Wow Conan is awesome.
one of the best yet
Update on Conan's podcast. He asks Dr. Arroyo why when he asked him to take his pulse he proceeded to strangle him. Dr Arroyo responded with, oh, I thought you meant to take your pulse away... . 😆😆😆
this is hysterical
I haven't laughed this long or hard for years!
whats worse conan, water buffalo or.. drinking hot sauce from the bottle
AaahhhWOOO AaahhhWOO!!
"Has anyone ever popped bottles on this show?" -Chris Hemsworth
I LOVE CONAN
Insane! 🤣🤣🤣
Man, I really love when Conan’s ethos about Showbiz.
I've known about Conan but never really gave him the time to watch him because I just felt I wouldn't like him. This is the first time I took the time to watch him performed and I was floored! What a legend, I'll have to go back and look at his performances!!! Blown away by his entertainment in this episode!!
"How could this be? Because he is the Kwisatz Haderach."
Best. Lunch. Date. Ever.
What a legend!!!
I want to see Eric André come on Conan's show so they can try to outdo each other
I want some behind the scenes or just any of the extra stuff, that would be great!
I don't think anyone will ever ask Sean about another episode than this from now on.
The camera focus to the mess of toppled hot sauce bottles, one still pouring on the table, then pan to Conan rambling about "what's funnier than Don Quixote", was awesome.
This is the type of pure chaos we need in this world
👏🏼-👏🏼-👏🏼 just wow!  🤩 Conan destroyed this show for good!  I don't see anybody topping this anytime soon.
This man Conan is crazy
There have been sooo many good episodes and guests on Hot Ones. But i got to hand it to Conan, you made this episode one of the best of all time, if not the best! Sean is ofc also such a great host! But wow, what a way to end the season! This was amazing!
Idk about this doctor
That warning Conan gave Sean at the beginning : “I don’t fear your wings man” 😂❤
just checking back in with the greatest moment the internet has ever had
Was he high?
Watching him drink that makes my mouth burn
Conan pours x sauce on wing, “Incre—- OH MY GOSH”
I refuse to believe any of those sauces are actually hot
Conan vs Gordon
Conan, Joel Edgerton, O'Brien
I like how despite the fact that Conan came with a gag and had to stick to it until the end poor guy, he still gave full attention to the questions and provided honest thoughtful answers. But the jumps from insightful to manically crazy must have made Sean's head spin)
Conan has been in pain since the third sauce but he's too professional to show it lol. What a class act
Now thats entertainment. Whats wrong with me, why cant i feel hahahaha
Dude is a madman 😊
Ok. Either they gave him all mild sauces or he is truly an alien. The things he did, are just one of those or, he is very good at hiding reactions and after this spent a week at the hospital lol
Conan the barbarian!!! amaaazing!😂😂😂
I love hot ones. Been watching since it first came out. Despite this, very rarely will I rewatch episodes. This is now my 5th time watching the Conan episode, and every time it's gold. This has to be the best one to date, and is going to be tough to beat. Pure unhinged genius; just like Conan.
please conan
“Thank you for doing your research.” from Conan O’Brian is the highest of praise. This guy is a show business master. This man has a gift of entertaining in his dorky way, and it works. I remember him being the first Late Night host that made tune in to a Late Night show. I had just gotten to High School.
I know it's just a 'bit' he did for the episode but that was not funny.
Conan is really hard to beat
Only episode worth watching
Should not have watched that before eating.....juck!!🤢🤮
LEGENDARY
That was next Level, Bravo Conan
His table is a total chaos... 😂
Came here from the drawfee stream vod
this deserves an oscar.
Conan- " You're not a Doctor are you?" Dr. Arroyo-" I should be"  😂
Dr Arroyo!!!! 😂
The best f****** show! Conan is the man!
What an absolutely legendary interview with a legendary guest and an upcoming legend of an interviewer. This feels like a historical event. And I am here for it.
I can’t watch him, it’s too disturbing
Oh Conan. This man is a legend. I have a cough after watching this from laughing and cackling.
Best episode!!
The best one yet 😆😆
When he hit me with that DOOOORIAHH I lost it
Of course Conan set up bits for this
He really said old testament, new testament, Chaucer's tales, and Mad Magazine
Jordan Schlansky should be next. He would absolutely come prepared in various ways.
The toilet the next morning must be even worse looool
That  Was F’ing Epic!!!
😂 hilariously impressive..made everyone previously on..look like wimpy 😅
Dr Royal reminds me of Dr Nick from the Simpsons....Hello everybody
No spice through his Irish fam, but plenty of jokes and dark humour
The fact that the only response to the hot sauce is Conan's rising flush...GOAT
Conan just beat Haley Berry
This feels like a duel between greats
Best episode to date.
absolute maniac!! one of the few episodes that had me cracking up out loud!! Cheers Conan, cheers!!! Bravo
Here for the culture
Now i know where Funny Marco got the wings in the pocket but from. Smh
The Best episode and funniest guest so far!!!!!
Not the way I expected this to go lol. Great interview!
Conan is my hero. This was so good 😂
😂😂
Best. Guest. Ever.
I really like you Conan, I’d be so happy to be your friend. Such a cool fun nice guy 👍🏼 Thanks for so many laughs
"Richard Nixon would be a fantastic guest! Based on the voice alone, probably... Lincoln."  That hot sauce was doing it's work!
Ohhh my F God.... Hands down the best. Conan is the GOAT
I feel so bad for that water buffalo. :(
Eh ... I love Conan, he's hilarious but I think this show kinda loses something when the guest is putting on a show. My favorite episodes are the ones when the guests let go of their Hollywood personas. This was the complete opposite of that.
Goat guest
I only watched this now after Chis Hemsworth, and wow, Conan is  a menace.
Conan is such a funny dude.
When he started to turn red  though 😂😂😂😂😂
Holy hotwings! that was LEGENDARY! bless you Sean Evans! and bless you Conan O'Brien
Back for my weekly dose of rewaching this masterpiece.
Reminded me of The Simpsons when Homer eats the chilli 😂
If you want to sing the high notes, you have to mean it.  O´Brian fcking drank 124.000 Scoville straight from the bottle with a straight face. xD
Good God
Conan was really entertaining and. He should start his own show.
Holy sharp
🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭
I watched this four times already. It all still feels so brand new. I love you so much, Conan! GOAT!
I love the structure of this new Conan O’Brien show 😂
Absolutely unbelievable, absolute genius why they ever took him off television was the biggest mistake of any TV network to this day, LONG LIVE CONAN!!!!!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤
He said “I am what I Am, as did Popeye, as did Gandhi, - but he forgot, as did the supreme being
He had to have cheated somehow. I dont know how, but  how can one man have so much raw talent and also be impervious to pain?
Sean saying “Incredible!” like every time he would act like a madman with the wings! 😂😂😂
I’ve had a crush on Conan for YEARS! Takes notes men… when a man can make a woman laugh like Conan makes me laugh.. looks don’t matter so much. I would totally break my 6 years of celibacy for him!! 😂
conan hahaha well done my man
I Love this so much!
After this Sean Evans probably didn't do a solid s*** for at least a week.
Bro just bathed in Da Bomb. Absolute madman.
Such a strange looking person...
Fantastic and simply beautifully executed 😂😂
WOW!!! Best one ever! Sooooo great
Lol his face is so red!
its even better on the second watch
This was the most demented episode ever. By a long shot. Conan is the GOAT!
Best guest, no contest.
Conan is the best guest ever.
This was by far my favorite episode of all time 😂❤❤❤
I WANT to know how bad it burned when at the toilet 🚽
That was incredible.
This makes me imagine what kind of guest Robin Williams would have been were he still around 💔 this had a taste of his manic humour☺️
“Where’d you goto medical school?”   “1998” 😂
I used to love Conan O'Brien.  Now, I worship him like a GOD.
Dr. Arroyo really almost took Conan's pulse there
Funny, but weak. Who did he pay to have children hot sauces swapped out?  It was the dr....I knew it.
I cried from laughing so hard. He’s the best!
This guy took the show to another level, no one will get there again. And it's funny that at the beginning, it looked like it was going to be a normal show, a regular show. But then, idk when, Conan completely lost it and like a rocket he took it to another time and space, no one knows what happened 😂😂😂 It was really nice though that Conan complimented Sean on his interviewing skills 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
That was insane 😮
him drinking straight from the bottle is unhinged 😂
This must be the first time I've seen Sean completely stunned and flabbergasted.
Conan is a boss
I believe he puked
He seems to be a mutant of whatever
Red heads have higher thresh holds.
This has been the episode where I have laughed the most. Conan is just brilliant!
Conan is an animal lol.
It seems like Conan O'Brien could be great Joker
I believe Conan has an above average intelligence of some kind, but it didn't seem like a very bright behaviour.
Started with small teensy bites, ended up tongue bathing in the bomb and eating everything.
That was the best! 😅😂
Conan crushing it, in the attempt to out do all others.
YOOOOO! BEST Episode Ever!!!!
LOL. Hilarious
Best of luck to whoever the next guest is going to be. There is no topping this. What a legend.
Give me Jordan Schlansky.
Anyone back here from the new season premiere? 😅
Why does Conan have to be so over-the-top idiotic? That shtick is so old and obnoxious.
This is it, nothing can top this !
Conan O'Barbarian
Best guest of all time on Hot Ones
Never gets old no matter how often I rewatch it!
I will miss this man 😂😂😂
His comedy is stronger than the heat 😂
And this is why Conan is and will always be an all-time great.
I'm seriously surprised this hasn't gotten more views😮
hahahaha
so funny, talk about amazing.  I cant believe ti
Conan at his finest!
I'm so glad Conan said something because I also have a hard time calling HBO "max"
I THOUGHT I WAS WATCHING CONAN'S SHOW AND SEAN IS THE GUEST HAHAHAHA
Conan is so dedicated that he is terrifying. Much respect.
Conan.... being a legend, as usual.
I remember watching Conan's late night shows at the time when our president was Tarja Halonen. Yep. I'm a Finn. He started joking about how similar he looked compared to her. Our press had a few front page news featuring Tarja and Conan wearing similar glasses and having similar expressions. The resemblance was uncanny 😂. At some point Conan was invited here and he actually met with our president. If I recall correctly Tarja was a avid fan of his show and she did watch the show most of the times. Got to say that Conan's sense of humor is extraordinary and it's hard to think of anyone on TV who has been able to make me laugh out loud as much as he has. Kudos Mr. O'Brien.❤
I should not have waited to watch this. It is amazing. Love Conan so much!
I can't believe that he dropped the "I'm fine" meme
I think this is the first time Harvard considers dropping loyalties.
One of the best interview out this on the hall of fame
What a legend
hooolllyyyyyy 🤣🤣🤣
This guy is classic thank you for being one
25:43  „You‘re not a doctor, are you?” “I should be” 🤣
Makes me wonder if this was fake sauce. If not. Conan is an absolute animal. Regardless, he was a great guest. Probably GOAT status.
He is clearly so grateful for the opportunities he’s been given. I just really respect this man. Comedy genius and (seemingly) a good person
Best episode EVER!! Better than Gordon Ramsey
This is awesome. Masterclass through and through.
What. A. God.
what an awesome dude! so funny!!!!
It's like Sean was the guest. Love this show, I really enjoyed this one too!
Impressive.
Pockets wings like it’s a comedy bit is a great way of not eating them. He totally got away with it.
simply the funniest episode so far, i laughed so hard! :D
Being British this is the first time I've seen this guy and he's really annoying... not funny at all
Conan is chaos incarnate and I love it
Best freaking episode ever !!!
Impressive.
Conan man, please just please
I never comment on any video ever! But this being my first comment on YouTube, I have to say Conan absolutely destroyed the wings and just absolutely entertained. This is pure comedy gold.  I can’t imagine any other guest doing this ever.  This has to be the best hot ones ever!
Conan looked like he was crossing over at the end 😳😳😳😳
instant classic👏
Buddies outa control!!!
Sean Evans by fare my favorite 😂❤ from The Hot Ones❤😂
I am so happy that Conan was able to come on Hot Ones! As soon as I saw the thumbnail I knew I was about to laugh. I had to watch it 3 times through tears and an ab workout from laughing before I was able to catch everything. It was so worth it. The Greatest Finale Hands down!
Well, I guess people who like that sort of thing will like that sort of thing, and there is no accounting for taste. I found all the recurring bits to be hacky, immature comedy. Conan is a bright guy, would have preferred just hearing him answer more questions and less "look at me, I'm so crazy" and half-assed absurdities (wings in pockets).
I just love Conan and he did not disappoint 😂
this is tooo funny 😭
This is the first time Sean didn't mirror the guest on how much sauce they eat.  Smart move
@8:20 I love when he is funny but I also love hearing when he is serious and finding out what he has to say about random stuff. I’m learning things from him 😂 I would be the person who would turn to the audience and do this to be funny 💀💀💀 “this show isn’t going very well, is it?” - me probably 😂 now I know better if I’m ever on a talk show 😎
He tries too much man, way too much! I liked early Conan stuff, not gonna lie, but this brand of get a laugh at all costs, not sure that has aged well.
Best part?  00:00 - 27:20
I don’t think it could get better than this
He is fun!! 🏆
"wise words from a wise and stable man" 💀💀
this guy's a genius, glad he made it. the living embodiment of full send
This was a little gross for my taste but still hands down best episode
What's wrong with me; why can't I feel?
Man I just love and admire Conan
I love how Sean just let Conan do his thing
Conan's face slowly turning red like a cartoon character LOL
I love Conan O'Brien. He is amazing. He never fails to make me laugh.
Sean going Oh My God multiple times throughout this episode is killing me 😂😂😂
Naah this is the best one. BAR NONE.
Epic❤
name someone funnier. you cant.
In the beginning it's Conan O'Brien in the end he turns into Rick Sanchez
Im imagining what it would be like if jordan schlansky and conan both ate hot wings
this honestly is disgustingly admirable
great show
I don't think there can be another Conan! Conan is one true legend :)
Conan definitely had that buffalo taken out. Could see it in his lifeless eyes.
Bro conan is so badass
Mis jodidos felicitaciones a esta leyenda.... Simplemente esta loco... Tomó al toro por los putos huevos, sean estaba asustado de las bolas que tiene connan 60 años señores ❤❤❤❤❤
I love that Sean held his own when Conan couldn't hear thru the ringing in his head from all the spixe absurdity and how he struck a balance between trying to wrangle Conan while letting him just be Conan lol. Also he called.Conan out for being so cocky about it in the beginning and I am here for it because he still did it with empathy. Conan is right - truly a great interviewer.
That final monologue from Conan had me absolutely keeled over laughing! 😂🤣🤣🤣
CONAN THE GOAT OF TALKSHOW HOSTING.
If you told me Sean Evans was an AI robot from 10 years in the future, I wouldn't question it
Hilarious
Get over the obsession with tabasco clones
"There's funny everywhere. Don't be a snob, look high and look low."
I've never seen anything like this before
Go back to the  1 table.
This was just brilliant 😂
There's some compelling scientific evidence that gingers actually have a higher pain threshold than everybody else, and I can't help but wonder if that was a factor here.
Comedy Gold here. Unscathable.. akin to David Blaine but stepped up x10 into controlled hysteria.. wow a top hot ones episode here !
🐐!
affordable doctor😂
Best one yet!!!
Legendddddd
The key to nuclear fusion lies somewhere within Conan O'Brien's stomach.
Conan is the funniest 😭😭😭
After watching this episode almost all other episodes are slow and boring, very few come close to Conan's energy.
the goat talkshow host 💯 conans the best
it feels so scripted and bland.  couldn't get into it.  I like Conan's interviews better.  He's a better side comedian.
In my opinion, Conan and Craig Ferguson are the greatest hosts of all time. Absolute comedic geniuses in every aspect of the craft.
What a f***ing legend
He made DJ Khaled look like Hello Kitty.
This was a bloodbath 😂
The has been several great Hot ones shows... But this one might be IT.
Conan just put everyone else to shame.. nobody is THAT real 😆 🤣 😂
Holly molly  The best episode...
This is the best hot ones ever, I can't belive this exists.
He just straight out of control, love it !
This was definitely worth the hype. Glad i watched it.
This is best episode ever.
so... who is the host? lulz
I hope you never die Conan. Or atleast for 4 more years.
Eugene Wilder Wonka vibes 😂
I got heartburn just watching this episode
Conan is the best ... definitely my favourite of all the talkshow hosts.
Easley the best episode so far!!
So unhinged! I F**kn love it!
LEGEND
Put Conan at the end of Mortal Kombat but you can't possibly beat him
End of show, camera guy Bill is hilarious
Funniest show ever lol
Conan's a low key goat
I don't know that this episode will ever be beaten, just in terms of sheer enjoyment.
This is my 5th + time watching this one
The way he held the hockey stick and didn’t say anything about it made me laugh the hardest.. sorry Connan, still a legend, you are.
Best one ever haha love conan
UN. HINGED.
Best episode ever!!!
You sure you gave him hot sauce? Greatest ep ever 🤣🤣🤣🤣
wing drop
No one will ever top this for me .... what a legend
Man, I had forgotten just how good of a Prop-comedian Conan is. I also love the fact that, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't de-rail the interview... Well, not for long anyways.  Bet he was even more impressed with Sean after he was done with the interview, than he was before it.
You never really knew where Conan landed politically but one could guess but he knew how to talk to everyone and make everyone comfortable and laugh. The GOAT!! All these new late night host are just 🗑️.
This episode is the cure to everything
Call the Wife!
23:00 "I'm fine! I'm perfectly fine!"
“The other guy” got good ratings.  Conan did not.
Conan really tapped into his inner Macho Man for this episode 😂😂😂
THE BEST HOT WING EPISODE EVER! I COME BACK TO WATCH IT WHENEVER I NEED A GOOD LAUGH
1) Boss music started playing before the interview started  2) it was nice of conan to compliment sean, he really handed him a crown there...  3) i don't know why but i felt really sad for conan in the entire 2nd half of this...  4) i'm worried about conan... i don't know why !!!!  5) can someone please check up on him?
Hands down best appearance on this show
Go back to one table.
Este pana me hizo reir como nunca 😂😂
I find myself revisiting this episode and the Bobby lee, joey diaz episodes. They always bring a smile or laugh no matter what. If anyone else has any recs from here, please share.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA oh man
I dont get the part when Conan said it's an amateur move to tell the audience that it's not going well. What does he mean?
This is the most unbelievable episode
I yam what I yam. 🍠
By far the best I’ve seen 😂
25:17😂
Here from Conan's podcast talking about this experience! Definitely didn't disappoint 😂
This episode’s worth of spice just made up for all of the years of no spice growing up. Crazy.
What an absolute great maniacal performance. Props.
Conan is top tier showmanship. As a kid I would sneak to the tv at night for the late late show, the driving desk bit was my favorite. I'm happy he has continued success. All my homies love Conan.
HEY TRIPPIE REDD!  THIS is HOW YOU DO IT  YOU P🐱SSY
BEST. HOT. ONES. EPISODE.  E.  V.  E.  R.   CONAN WE LOVE YOU.
Easily the best so far. I’m just commenting so other people see it.
Best Hot Ones eveeeeer 😂😂😂
"we are doing this live!" Bill o Reilly  😂
Who’s gonna top that? 😂
9.7M views  1 month ago， amazing
my stomach is fine with a healthy dose of chilly, but my colon is a mess for 3 days
I still think Conan's interview of Bowie, and the Bowie Hickory Dickory Dock song, was probably the apex of television.  There is no moment better than that.
18:41 gave me Joker vibes. “You can’t stop me”. Conan would be a great Joker 🃏
I was told by a good friend to watch this episode as a master class in comedy and I was not even a LITTLE bit prepared for what Conan brought to this episode. My GOD that man is a one-in-a-million personality and this was as good a showcase as any for what a madman GENIUS Conan O'Brien truly is.
That’s was pro asf
That did it....when he picked up THE LAST DAB and took a swig from the bottle, I just totally lost it. It's the hardest I've laughed all year so far...probably the best episode EVER! ! ! !
I would love to see you guys get Craig Ferguson on here. I don't know if he'd do it but I think it would be an incredible interview. Conan is a machine, the committment to the bit is unreal. Conan going for the shia treatment, dabbing all the wings. His whole head is like a tomato at the end LOL
Conan: the water buffaloe and i definitely made up.  Sean: that's nice. Conan: "it tasted good, but it tasted better, while staring at its head, over the fire pit."
This was quite the journey 😂
Conan clearly has that gene that makes you immune to capsaicin.  And yet still Da Bomb got him. Think about that.
I love how there's genuine Terror in Sean's eyes when he looks at Conan
This was the most annoying guest on the show
This might be the GOAT performance on the show
Conan is seeing colors right now🤣😂🤣
Epic
...i and conan share a bday?
This boys and girls is a real tv show host!!! 🔥
I love me some Conan O'Brien 😂😅🎉
Ahahahaha hes not the best  But hes affordable 😂😂😂😂😂
So random but I'm so curious if his hair stylist curls his hair? I've seen it straight in previous years..curious minds😂
He still had better table manners than Gordon Ramsey
Best. Episode. Ever.
Why?
This is the best interview so far 😂😂
THIS IS THE BEST HAHAHAHAHA CONAN IS THE BEST
LIFE!!!!!!!! 😂
If Conan had died after this episode, that was it for the hottie onesies...
Honestly, the best episode
Best episode I’ve ever seen of Hot Ones. I can’t see any other episode being able to top this.
After this he welded a building in Wiltshire. Impressive
Conan is about to be -99 percent Irish
Mind blowing.  Only a skilled performer could pull that off!  He raised the bar and I was already impressed with Conan before this!
22:55 "The good news is that's a wrap..." Conan: Ah no I have entered another phase
G.O.A.T level performance. Absolutely legendary.
20:42 the video takes an interesting turn
He's a boss
I want to congratulate Conan O'Brien for his birthday.
I feel like Conan dragged talk shows back into popularity with his bare hands just so he can be the last legend as they die out
My man sean was trying so hard not to fanboy hard but he cracked
Conan won Hot Ones.
Best and funniest episode I’ve ever seen!
I wonder how long it'll take him to mention he's "Irish" - two seconds
This is the GOAT episode
Conan is the man!
Conan is a legend. Always going the extra mile for comedy.
Conan is in Beast Mode
Excellent!
Now this is a season finale. Fantastic!
I like how the hot sauce gradually turned Conan into Lewis Black.
Yk Conan is probably EXACTLY what SpongeBob would look like in real life , and act
This is one of the greatest performances of all time. Bravo Conan.
Conan survived
Wow😂
Two Irish fucken themselfs up. Seems like a casual Tuesday in a pub.
This was amazing
This is probably the best episode of this show I've ever watched. Conan is fearless and dedicates himself past 100%
At the end of the stooges bit Conan is really channeling that insane Chris Farley magic! for a brief moment i felt like he was back, got goosebumps!
The GOAT.
i remember watching episode 1 of late night with conan obrian. good times
He’s incredible, i can’t believe he’s controlling eating dabomb.
Foookin Legend 🫡
Watching this while enjoying some very mild salsa 😘
I never knew Conan was such a messy eater!!
Probably the best episode yet 😂👏🏻
Best Hot Ones Interview Ever 😂🎉❤
Did he go straight to the ER after this ?
Sean, you just had your greatest guest, and nothing's topping this. Fantastic episode.
it was an emotional rollercoaster, i cried, laughed, screamed, feared for conan's life, reflected on life... uffff, just, a lot!  I have transcended
Conan is the king 👑 Gordon Ramsey is such a pu$$y
Conan is very intelligent. What I love about him is how unpretentious he is and nothing ever feels like it’s played up or played down to anyone. He hams it up but doesn’t ham it up at the same time. That’s hard to do, and he makes it look easy. A genuine class act that is unmatched by anyone else.
This is probably the best episode so far
I didn't think anyone could top the Gordon Ramsay episode. I stand corrected.
What an absolute legend 🤘🤘🤘 Conan 2024
This was alright he was a little too over the top
Double Dabbed Da Bomb 😂😮
Best episode so far.
An affordable doctor.. 😂
We all Miss you 90's Conan!!
One of the best episodes, hands down! 😂
LEGEND
I regularly play hoops (not well, but I play) in the 11 and 12, 12 is way more comfortable and feels better to play in than 31 and 32.  The 11 is way cooler though.
Conan looks like he has a full face of makeup on
he was the best
Gold
this is now the benchmark ep haha
dangggg best episode in years no doubt
Easily one of the best episodes
First and foremost I thought Conan was never going to be in this show, like ever; second if in a parallel universe he had an episode I imagined him dropping dead, like literally dead after the first wing. My future reincarnations will have the memory of Conan drinking hot sauce.
That was absolutely the best episode ever!
He’s in tears and saying I’M FINE 😂
Conan is the grinch who stole the hot wings. He can’t feel 😂
DJ Khalid was out done on spice……. By an Irish dude…..   What a legend Conan is on all fronts! 👏🏾
awesome performance
Popeye the Sailor + Gandhi = Conan O'Brien
BEST Episode EVER!
18:34 my fav 😂
Absolute Legend
Conan the O'Barbarian
The legend it was great
amazing cuman oh honam, or coman
Did Conan create Dr. Nick on The Simpsons??? 😂😂
“My intestines have turned into acid, but I can still do a plug.” Complete with milk, chicken and mucous dribble. Legend 😂
I’ve just watched Gordon Ramsey back to back with fire extinguishers etc and Conan is drinking straight from the bottle 😂
Guess Conan doesn’t do his own laundry
Man is nuts 😂😂😂
Legend
I'm a HUGE fan of Conan!!! But I mistakenly watched Hot Ones for the first time with Conan as the guest. I'm certain no other episode comes close to this one.
Man i'm so jaded but Conan always makes me laugh with his comedy skills.
El Aurance!
His hair so coifed , it looks like more than half an hour was spent on it. LAME
Hot Ones does Conan, Conan doesn’t do Hot Ones.
team coco forever
Just Conan being Conan. Thank you good Sir👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
GET NARDWUAR ON HOT ONES!
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the vomiting Kermit.
Conan ten toes stands on business and cements King status on this ep.
he got high on hot sauce.. lol
Lol, hes crazy
Why reuploading?
i dont believe that guy is a doctor.
Conan: incredible performance
I was going to comment how he literally just one upped Shia LaBeouf, but I think it's more like a ten up.
17:16 Everything Conan does is comedy genius. Just the way he brings the water glass into the frame is hilarious.
best episode ever, need a pt 2
If people remember the writer's strike of 2007-2008. Conan did his own thing at his Late Night Show. It was the best! Conan did amazing just being himself! Better than any previously written stuff.
The greatest interview on this show so far.
My jaw literally dropped so many times. Especially when Conan rubbed the hot sauce to his chest 😂
i would bleed to death internally if i did what conan did
This is the best episode of Hot Ones. 9.6M is a joke number!
Well said: he is a professional. Instead of crying, he ended up high on peppers 😅!! Great season finale: I know where the fireworks are coming from. 😂💣
Conan is honestly the best!
Probably the best guest so far😅😅😅😅😅
this is one of my favorite episodes ever
Legion 👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽
18:34 Conan sounds like the joker
No, Conan! Not Da Bomb! You never add extra Da Bomb!
That doctor went to the university if science
Well that was fuxking amazing
Deranged! And i LOVE HIM 😂
That some Eric Andre energy i definitely wasnt expecting
Best episode by far!!!! Genius.....
"and then the water Buffalo and I made amends..."
Pure madness, I’ve never been more entertained by Hot Ones (which is tough to say b/c they are all amazing) but Conan did it. He wins. Hope he’s okay after all that 🔥🚒😂
All I can say is that this man is a champion!
"You don't know what real danger is anymore!" --Me to everyone with "anxiety"
Read widely, and read well...
WAW
Fn savage
"I don't think there's a wing here that I couldn't eat like it's whip cream on a warm summer afternoon"
Best episode ever.
This was everything I thought it would be and more. Love Conan! 😂
Conan just drank a million scoville hot sauce like juice 😂. Best episode ever.
He is trully a professional.
One of the best episodes 🔥🔥🔥
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nothing the hot sauce did could hurt like the water buffalo bruise. He’s not overselling how wild that clip is.
Conan of the Boreal Valley.
My new favorite episode
When he said he, Popeye and Gandhi said “I yam what I yam.”
Sorry but the scoville rating on the pepper X last dab sauce is incorrect. That sauce is pretty mild
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cooooool whip cream
Welcome back Conan. That's the Conan we love and remember. The man is a complete comedic genius.
My favorite episode.
Wholesome humiliation ritual.
This man us that mf!
Please have Will Arnett do Hot Ones!
My favorite episode so far. Thank you for bringing us the gift of laughter 😆
“I’m fine!” 🤪
This is how a season finale should be done. Love Conan ♥️
Unbelievable the man is a GOD. Either that or the man is insane!😂 Most thrilling episode, I thought he was gonna die! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙏🏻
That was fricken EPIC!!!!! CONAN IS THE KING
Conan is the classiest maniac I’ve ever seen
Question to Conan: how can I make the audience feel theyre getting the best show ever if Im performing "Blackbird" somewhat poorly at an open mic night?
outstanding!
I feel like this is an alternate origin story of the Joker
an interview with teary eyes....
BEST HOT ONES EVER!  I've never laughed so hard. LOVE it!
Conan is probably going to regret this at his next number 2
I can't imagine what it's like to be conan obrien. Must be wild.
Conan is the absolute godfather of what he does , and it’s only able to be done by Conan- genius
I’m literally here for the first time as I saw a segment on cnbc this morning about the show. I wonder why this channel has never popped up as recommendation? 😮
Best ever!!!
Dude almost killed Sean
Not a chance 😂😂😂
This is the single best thing I have watched in a really long time. This is GOLD.
I have been here since day one, Conan was actually one of the best guests I have ever seen and I don't even like him, newfound respect for sure, love this
WOWSERS   That was over the TOP       Funny as all heckens     CONAN ROCKS
Easily one of my favorite episodes!! He did it in Conan O'Brien fashion!! I love it!!
Ouch. I used to love Late Night with Conan when I was younger but haven't seen him in years. Idk if it's because I'm more mature, or if he's just gotten more obnoxious, but this was painful to watch. He looks kinda creepy now & just radiates desperation to remain relevant. I feel kinda bad for the guy.
This is not your first time watching this.
Respect
Love it when Dr Roxo comes to the show!
Da bomb just glug-glugging away during the rant XD
thank heavens for the good doctor.
😂😂😂😂😂
Charlie Rose with hot wings
Best episode ever. Team coco for ever ❤
I have never seen a guest drink the sauce..... hahaha this was so hilarious!
22:25 crazy
I miss conan ❤
14/5.
This was really the Conan show Lol, I absolutely love this interview
No one makes me laugh like Conan does. I appreciate this very much. The Hot ones show is one of my favorite things to watch. Thanks for such great works!
I've loved watching Conan ever since I was little
Milk or water or limes ????
The Beast UNLEASHED!!
No stock in humor is as valuable as any one of Conan O'Briens brain cells...comedic liquidity at its highest and purest level
He would have been a great Baron Harkonnen.
You know, considering he is actually able to listen to and accurately answer questions at the end (a lot of other guests cant) ... even after actually drinking from the bottle ... means he really has few receptors that react to spicey heat.  He literally cant feel it.
Im not stuck in here with you, you're in here with me. Tf did I just watch? And why is the greatest thing ive ever seen?
I’m watching this a month later and I still can’t believe it. CONAN IS A LEGEND
Conan you legend
Conan Rules
Conan cursed.... my life is complete
The Dr. Arroyo joke is exquisite 👌 😂
Was it a 4 year medical school?  Ya, it was supposed to be.
This was one of the most unhinged and hilarious things I've seen in awhile.   My stomach hurts from laughing.
All Shouts to Sean and the Hot Ones family.  Even Stephen Colbert is boring after watching your show ❤
Conan was the first talk show host to show me the ACTUAL differences between Israelis and Palestinians, with no bias on his part. ❤
Happy belated Birthday to Conan! This episode dropped the day he turned 61
Connan had always been a legend
That was by far the most entertaining hot ones I have ever seen.  Its tempting to believe it wasn't real hot sauce the way conan was guzzling it
and Gandhi said it. LOL
bring back the 1 table setup
Conan has been my favorite out of all the American talk show hosts hands down. He is one of my favorite comedians as well. And, at the same time, he is incredibly intelligent, sincere, and self-depreciating in a good way. He is a class act. High respect for him (this is not Conan writing this by the way lol). I think the popularity of this episode of Hot Wings is proof how many people adore Conan <3
I mean... it's Conan... The greatest of all time
1:44 WHERE?!!!   out of state  you should go 🤣🤣🤣🤣
If coolio was there he would’ve need to respond to this 😂😂, RIP brother.
Somehow I think he lost his sense of taste from COVID
Wait! When a guest double dabs or eats extra, so does Sean! But Conan chugs a hot sauce bottle… then Sean goes silent, lol! Conan is the best.
Love Conan, such a funny great guy! So glad he did an episode of one of my favorite shows. :)
😱😱😱😱😱
“I’m fine,” he says with bloodshot eyes.
When will Tim Dillon be on? :D
He's dying, what a lunatic, I can't stop laughing at his vibe at the last couple of sauces !!  Also, props to him for saying "What's funnier than Don Quixote?" Amen, amen.
I have got a whole new respect for Conan.  For somebody who claims they had nothing but bland food, he sure powered through those impressively! A true performer and professional.
Conan is the GOAT
Get actor Kevin Durand on here, Freya Allen too
❤❤❤
You should have Dr. Now on the show.
By far the best episode that I have ever watched.  This is the first episode to make my stomach hurt from laughter.  🤣
I love Conan - he's hilarious. But I physically cannot watch that ending without gagging.
Wow!!!
Conan breaking Sean was so beautiful LOL
This was so funny 😂
20:56 peak
A god amongst men . A true lunatic
Conan became literally the hot one 😂😂
Steve-o: I do all stunts... Conan: hold my hot sauce... 😂😂😂😂😂
You can’t choose the best clip or clips of this show, every second of this entire interview is f*cking genius
I had to give up after Conan put the third wing in his pocket at 6:01.  His style is dead-center 8th grade humor, and that's not a complement.
Fun fact: red heads are naturally resistant to capsaicin
You have to get Richard Ayoade on here.
This is the best episode I've seen, I got Robin Williams vibes at times, he would have been an awesome guest too. When Dr. Arroyo put the stethoscope on Sean's tongue I was friggin rollin! 🤣🤣🤣
Dj Khaled just staring in disbelief
This is the best one yet!... Top 5 anyway
I love Conan been watching him since I was a kid staying up late with my TV brightness setting on the minimum setting and then falling asleep in math class the following morning every time. He nailed this show as his usual self but he completely made it his own. Gotta love em.
Getting older Conan is the best Conan.
😂 I’m like wanting to 🤢 😅 Conan is insane😂
Conan is such a LEGEND!
22:29 Easily the funniest comedic delivery! 😂❤
We NEED the unedited version of this . IMMEDIATELY
Yeah, I feel sorry for his GI doctor... And his toilet
He was most likely hurting for the whole day week
Chaucer’s tales really aren’t funny anymore 💀
I think Conan is the first person to just break Sean 😂 I'm dying.
Conan is just so quick witted. When Sean said he had tears in his eyes from the hot wing and Conan instantly quipped back that it's actually because he's meeting his idol, it's like he didn't even have to think about a response. It was just so natural.
And that my friends is called experience
I love how he refers to Jay Leno as, “the other guy” lol!
WHY CAN'T I FEEL?!
Has to be the best episode.
Conan is a badass and funny AF...😅. One of the best
The god himself, Conan!! 😤😤
This is the best hot wings episode I have seen!
"You're so good at your job as an interviewer."  "Thanks!"  "I'm taking over this episode."  "Ohhh-kayyy?"
The only volume Conan cares about is his hair.
THE BEST GUEST ON THIS SHOW.
Conan reminds me of shake from aqua teen hunger force
as a Mexican who loves spicy and has bought all the hot ones sauces … Conan O’Brien made me look so weak😂😂😂
I never expected less from this guy. He’s legit.
Been waiting a long time for this ever since Mila Kunis mentioned him in her hot ones. Did not disappoint.
They should just cancel the show. Nothing will ever top this
"He's not a good doctor he's an affordable one" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan is a legend nobody is gonna top this
Finland loves Conan!
God this was amazing
Ive watched all First We Feast-episodes. This is the first one where I literally cried from laughter and had a belly ache afterwards.
I think if Robin Williams were still here (rest in peace) this is exactly what his turn would of looked like, so I thank you Conan, 1 for being you and hilarious and 2 for making me see you as Robin Williams on this show! Don't get me wrong, Robin would of been much more elaborated with his larger than life aura! But Conan absolutely smashed this show! Apologies, but I can't help but make the comparison!
Did they cut the bit where Conan knocks over bottles on the table? I swear I remember him doing that when this episode premiered. At 23:38, they are all suddenly lying flat on the table.
Did Sean even ask any questions this time?! 😂😂
He is the most amazing guy…ever.
That was legend wait for it... DAIRY! LEGENDARY!!!!
How do you say "I'm the Captain now", without saying "I'm the Captain Now" I think the only other person who could have contemplated pulling this off would have been Chris Farley. The way Conan set it up and was able to follow through...Respect to both Mr. O'Brian for pulling this off and Sean for just going with Chris's flow.
It’s time to stop airing Hot Ones. Conan was the best guest the show has ever had and ever will have. Every future guest will pale in comparison to this already extremely pale man. Thank you for your service, Hot Ones, Conan is the greatest of all time
hello o brien i am korean i wan t to see how fast you speak recently as your old. i waant to compare another comedian who kr comedian. as a result you win although you more older than him
ABSOLUTE MANIAC LOVED IT
I always liked hot ones but this I a masterpiece, never laughed so much before
I feel like every middle-aged man in Hollywood has a travel show
CALL THE WIFE 😂
please someone!! make a ton of memes out of this 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You wanna know who I really want to see on the hot ones???? I wanna see Kendrick lamar🙂 my most favorite artist
That is a strong dude
If you want to understand the duality of Hot Ones watch this right after the Viola Davis episode.
To have Conan O’Brien compliment your interviewing skills is about as high praise as it gets.
Conan is fantastic!!!
Probably the best episode!! Viva Conan!!
funniest thing in the world
Conan got high on the spice lol
Love this episode. I need to get this season of sauces. I’ve been through the gauntlet at least 10 times (season 19) and idk how he just housed that stuff. Drug test that man lol jk
Only way Conan can top this would have been to combine all the sauces into one then dip a wing in it.
I love Coco!!
tbh u need the doctor on not obrian.
That was amazingly insightful, Conan.  I'm glad I watched this one late at night, you had my full attention. Now for the love of God STOP DRINKING THE HOT SAUCE.
My god that was amazing
Conan is a complete animal sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh 😱 Whada legend and absolute unit.
its always the comedians that underestimate the sauces in the first half xD
Well, no one ever accused the Irish of having a low pain tolerance.
Where do you buy these?
8:20 is such a great question and fascinating answer. Conan focuses on the 200 in the audience rather than us viewers at home, and if it was 5 in the audience I’m sure the answer would be the same. GOAT
Has anyone purchased sauce from this guy? Is it fresh or has it been on the shelves for 4 years?
Hes gonna burn all over for a week
He just assainated your wings with no problem ❤
I watched a bunch of other episodes and Conan made them all boring. This performance was Legendary.
Ab solute legend
Conan watch the Sodium from straight chugging the sauces.
It's always Da Bomb that makes everyone quesstion their decisions 😹 Conan 'O Brien's definitely mastered his craft too. Gotta give respect.
this was great
Oh the pain the next day would bring. That said, consummate professionals, both.
I'm guessing this isn't your first time watching.
Didnt like this one at all... Its just sad. No real intervew, no real talk, just Conan trying to be.. I dont know really. Very sad one.
I will say something offensive, but this is the first time I've felt some appreciation on Conan as a person
I’ve watched this show for a long while. I’ve never seen anything like this. Conan absolutely killed this. I’ll be watching the show.
Conan is such a legend🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yep, this is the 4th times I rewatch this in 4 days  LOVE YOU SO MUCH CONAN  may 28-  watched this 19 times  sept 30, 2024  - 27 times
well this Conan episode might be the most popular
Conan is the BEST. COME VISIT ME IN URUGUAY!!!!
😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
We need Conan to host an episode. Preferably without the guest knowing 😂
4:45 TORILLE
That was absolutely disgusting and grand
Anybody else catch him referring to Leno as “the other guy” 😂
Watching Sean just break down at the end of this is one of the most impressive feats ever performed on this show. Conan is a mastermind.
On that note, please, try to get Mark E. Fischbach (a.k.a. Markiplier) for your next season! 😇
"You've been requesting Conan for years, we've been chasing Conan for years" and you can tell Conan's been preparing for this one FOR YEARS! 😆
People, go to TeamCoco's channel and watch the video Conan Has A Post-"Hot Ones" Check Up With Dr. Arroyo.
Probably the last host that didn't need a team of writers to be funny, always love seeing him not suppressed buy the studio
Conan acts like he’s coked up lol
How does he get so much done. I'm 33, I have an nth of that get go
Love your page but your guest…
So a fan of hot wiings ,but putting  the red,love him n friend  .he is always
No worry coco,appreciate your Comcast’s
Easily...greatest guest ever.
Love my friend of tv,love his humor and love podcast of conad.
Pod cast,only one or other
Dude,fan of red head.
Just as good comedy as his podcast 10 / 10
The ending was absolute chaos!! Table cloth soaking da Bomb, drool and snot flying all over, milk spilling!! What a closer!!! LOLOLOLOL!!!  Great show!! Pure gold!!
The first time Conan said "Max", I thought he meant Max Weinberg.
EFFING Brilliant!
Best one ever.
Conan absolutely CRUSHED it.
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!!???
Conan truly lives to entertain. The Best Hot Ones episode so far. Thanks, Conan.
This is my umpteenth time watching this episode 😂 anyone else here again and again?? I love Conan soooo much ♥️  such a great and funny man! 😂
Jesus Christ... I've watched this 4 times now... I laugh harder each time. Conan is a God.
This is one of the funniest interviews I’ve seen in a long while. Conan is such a legend.
His onion ring burned for 2 weeks after this! lol
after i got covid for a few months this was me. hot sauce did nothing. but i am one of the lucky ones and got my taste buds back. i think conan has covid
This man Is a living Legend.Absolutely the VERY BEST
By far the funniest episode I've ever seen
Only Conan!  I am crying  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan squirreling away bones is an odd tic.
Bro aren't no one interviewing Conan. He's the one interviewing you.
If i could i would a STANDING OVATION FOR MR CONAN
What an awesome person Conan is. I enjoyed this so much.
this is the best hot ones episode I´ve ever seen. Please Sean, bring him back!
best hot ones ive ever watched
Lol Sean didnt know how to respond when Conan moved to level 1000 😅
This was the most self-destructive thing I've ever witnessed!!  😲 🤣🤣
What was you favorite moment with Conan? Yes.
Sean bring in nardwaur
WE NEED CHRIS BROWN!
His ancestors would be proud
I love conan lol
Still can’t compare to his pain and sadness in his heart 😢 I love Conan O’Brien so much ❤
What a fake human
I dislike how this does not have more views!!
Stuffing chicken wings in ya pocket to getting choked while eating is crazy lol
TEAM COCO all day 😂
I give him 4 more years and he's 6 feet under.
This was fantastic! What a mad man!
I want to know what the behind the scenes looked like on this one.
I do love there barbacoa hot sauce but man do i have a hard time ordering it from there website. Never seems to work for me on checkout.
24:16 on The Last AB Experience the way Conan speaks, he sounded like Timon from The Lion King!
crazy. dear lord. the damage in the toilet. can't imagine
They missed the chance to bring Jordan schlansky in to critique the wings hahahaha
conan finished
Love you Conan 😍 i remember the episode where the lady said she would leave her husband for you...and same for me 😊✨ thank for making me smile always
conan is one crazy mf.
Just now finding out, after years of watching him, that I share a birthday with Conan lol
I love Conan's chaos, plus it's nice to see someone actually eat most if not all the wing for once.
Conan O'Brien is SAVAGE!!! The Beast, The King!!!!
He made history!!
This is my favorite thing I ever watched on YouTube.
So many great moments, but when Conan called in his Doc to check on Sean and he put the stethoscope on his tongue...nearly killed me.
Conan is an unstoppable force but he’s also an immovable object.
The music is way too loud anyone else hearing this? Takes me out
"I said that to Bea Arthur and I was right" is one of the funniest things I've ever heard
Even my temperature went up two degrees during the show.
this is the best hot ones ever hands down. pure unbridled chaos
Wow. I am about to die. Several minutes left and Conan is losing it.
This Conan guy is funny. He should be a host.
“Call the wife!” 😂
What the actual F*"* what a legend
I got disgusted by Brian to be honest, this was not funny inmo.🙄
Seems like conan decided to have a second go at the water buffalo
Get MatPat now that he is retired!!! Gimmie a like to get MatPats dream made!!
Last rant has big rick sanchez vibes
gotta love Conan. the best hot ones by far.
Conan is the GOAT!
ffs
This is by far the best episode I love Conan 😂
I love how he can let people totally explode
I've seen every episode of this show. This is the first time I've ever been truly scared for everyone involved.
i love this episode
Seeing Da Bomb stain his lips red and drain all the color from the rest of his face made me wonder if that's the chemical that made the Joker all freaky.
Uncle Roger next please!
this advertisement worked on me
I've watched this multiple times. Pure comedy gold
Absolute madman, and I’m here for all of it.
Conan is maybe my favorite show host/celebrity in general, so it makes me happy that he totally destroyed this and ate every sauce without much of an issue at all. Also, easily the funniest episode of Hot Ones ever.
Conan went above and beyond!!!!!!! the things you do for us, we don't deserve you Conan!
Best idea: make Conan the host of Hot Ones.
Well… Last dab? Conan said hold my Guinness..Conan wins 🥇I don’t know how anyone can top him.
This channel is so popular I freaking love this show
God, I thought Steve-O was crazy. This is a whole nother level!
Conan is a BEAST
rewatching some old episodes this is probably my top favorite episode. made me laugh almost all the way through
Amazing
That nanosecond look of contempt as Dr Arroyo walks away... you can't teach comedy instincts like that.
Dude went all in. Comedic genius.
Conan. Always the best. 🍻
Eric Andre is great but he's got nothing on this guy over here
Note: Almost 9.4 million views in 3 weeks. Check in later
Conan my man my idol my role model
Classic Conan! This  was so good I am watching this twice back to back. Conan’s commitment to the “bit” (life as he says) is like no other. He is at 110% 200% of the time. Keep on keepin’ on Conan. Cheers!
Insane episode!
The best Hot ones interview.
Control the sauce
When he poured da bomb onto that wing I wanted Shaun to pull him aside and tell him "this one's for real please don't" but I also wanted him to chug it. Both sides warred.
This is the greatest Hot Ones episode of all time. And there won’t be a better one. This is a finale to the entire show. If it isn’t it was for me.   Long Live Team Coco.
Can we have a Conan sauce?
4:46 I personally found the dry and 'mundane' vibe you showed of finland very comedic
only Conan wood go somewhere and do bits the entire time, and has been doin it since he left the simpsons and got his bright Irish face got on the TV.
the best one so far! thanks!
When he started rubbing the sauce all over himself, I was expecting him to spontaneously combust
Conan needs a bathroom o.o
By far my fav guest
Wing drop 🔥
Okay well now you have to get Andy on the show
Conan should have a PHD in comedy, What an absolute grandmaster.
' i grew up in an irish house' I knew he was in trouble already, my heart went out
never seen anything of this dude, but i love watching all of the hot ones episodes, makes u explore new people and its always so entertaining, fav show on youtube
This was AMAZING!
This is the best hot ones episode ever! Super funny. Conan is the best. 😂
conan the coal miner
That last question about reading has the wisest quote I have I heard....  Conan is truly genius 👏 🙌
Finnally A Legend
Bro was A Bloodless Irish In the beginning of the Show. Bro Became A Mexican Farmer In the End of the show. Respect Tîtõ
Can we sit them at one table again?  What year is it?
The GOAT... The OG... Still clueless why only 9.3mil... I hope more ppl understand his comedy
nice conan you have waxed your tongue haven't you
15:30 music is from WW2 channels takes me away from the interview a little bit haha.
By far the best guest
Bro Conan is really a genius
Legend
Fantastic episode!!
Watching this 'cause John Oliver.
Watching this again. The pure art here is absolutely unreal! He is a comedic genius, all while being kind and still bringing Sean into the bit. Absolutely remarkable!!!
He is a special speed of crazy.
This is the first one of these I've seen and something tells me I've already seen the best one.
conan’s househelp looking at him put those wings in the jacket .-.
Yeah ketchup makes me sweat instantly - plain ketchup
My respect for Conan has absolutely skyrocketed.
You guys still are afraid of covid?
If Conan was to ever pass away, I'd want this to play at his funeral!!! Funniest late night host of all time!!!
Now that is how to be a guest! Conan gets it.
Oh man! Conan had this chili high at the end!!
What?!!! 😂😂😂 that was insane!!!!!!😂😂😂
TOP 3 Hot Ones episodes.  Conan is a beast !
Ramsay's overexaggerated BS is a footnote against this.
i love that instead of saying Leno he just says "the other guy"
There’s a cheat code somewhere going on here. I’m British but a big fan of Conan. That’s the first time I’ve ever heard him swear like that.
Finally you guys got Coco!!! Hands down one of the best eps ever 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
he’s a SAVAGE in disguise
The absolute Top G of Hot Ones, no one greater...CONAN O'BRIEN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
Conan is LEGEND!! Red heads are crazy yo 🤣 Miss him on late night😎
That was hard to look at in the end there lol.
"feel for the pulse" "it's there"
The Maestro's jacket is NOW very famous. Officially.
"We had to go out with some fireworks." Yeah, from the behind.
Wow. Just wow. That was incredible.
Never seen Sean so nervous!!!
richard nixon sha sha blah blah halbhabl  bl;ahalks;dkljsdfljk lksdflkjsdfkljsdfljkdsf blah blah blah
Dud doesn't want to leave any DNA ON the table puts the wing in his pocket ohhh love it 😂😂😂
The wing drop was the best part
This is the GOAT FWF video.
Hall of Fame!
The diversity of guests never gets old.
What a waste of everyone's time.
The Fn GOAT!!!!
I didn't know that Conan O'Brien + hot sauce = Rick Sanchez
Someone please add Hitler's speech on top of Conan's rampage after the last dab.
Get the man some well deserved ice cream.  He conquered and destroyed the wings!  Delivered us entertainment and comedy in every way.  Made me think of Chris Farley with his comedic chaos and I loved it.  👏👏⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 🥳Conan Conan Conan 🥳
Nobody will ever top this
Conan hijacked the episode in the best way possible, I love it!!!
I have watched every episode in the last 4 months and this is by far the hardest take and funniest episode. Conan!
This is the best hot ones ever!
Conan is so unhinged in a good way. I've seen so many instances where his comedy brain completely takes over and he starts to get more and more wild for a laugh and at some point, it's like he regains consciousness and is like, oh dang, what just happened lol. Anyways, this was insane and very entertaining
incredible
18:29: Betcha it's _about_ to be good footage... 🤣🤣
I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.
Man I knew Conan was appreciative! 😁😁
Watching Conan bullying the spiciness through Sean was kind of interesting... 🤣🤣
OMFG I laughed so hard, BEST one you done yet!!!! Always loved Conan lol
I literally dont believe DJ Khaled actually exists after watching this
Conan is truly amazing ❤
Conan is the GOAT at everything he does.
Conan’s hair is wild lol
This is one of the greatest things I have ever seen
I love how he borrowed Dr. Arroyo from the beloved Will Ferrell parrot on the shoulder bit from yesteryear... Love everything about this
He’s sooo funny
The guy is a icon!!! The best episode,  the best late show host eeeeeever
haha! Great show! 🤗😘
This has to be one the greatest moments in the history of the internet.
Sean is letting the show get to him. Humble yourself, Sean. You were a lowly college kid doing broadcasting in the Midwest, and now you get to sit 6 ft away from some of the world's celebrities.  Embrace where you are in life. Don't get so wrapped up in the gimmick of the show, because it got you where you are today,  just buying suede jackets.
This is the best episode ever
😂😂😂😂 i was dying after he rubbed his hands with hot sauce
Cant believe it he's crazier than Steve-O 😭😭😭
He's incredible 😀😀😀
🤣
RIP Conan
“It’s not a BIT! This is a SHOW, not a BIT!!” -Conan setting the record straight  WHAT A MFKN MADMAN/BOSS!!!!!!! 😂
Conan is one of the best to ever do it. Sucha proffesional, always funny and most importantly a really good person.
Just like when Fry has 100 cups of coffee, Conan chugged that last sauce and reached Nirvana for his last answer haha 😂
And now we're all looking at the Fjord
I love Conan’s dedication to the art.
haha this was hilarious😂
😂
"There's comedy in the Old Testament" 10/10
❤
I feel bad for Sean. The guest can’t even let him be the host.
Wow. I never watched much Conan, but this episode was insanely good.
Gloria!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
His weird eating freakouts are kinda gross😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
He puts a dab on the final half of wings. Legendary or fake one or the other
I came back for the memes
Might be the best episode yet.
Is it just me or does his hairdo make him look like a Who from Whoville? Conan O'Whovillie
Best episode ever. Conan put it out there.
True comedy couldn't stop laughing
the end of the show turned into rick and morty "CONAN O'BRIEN.... 100 YEARS... CONAN O'BRIEN... 99 SEASONS"
Conan still has it!🤣🤣🤣
What did I just watch! Conan! Crawl out of the bottle brother! lolol
Canon wasad at his stylist that day lol 😂
conan obrien vs shia labeouf .
Warren G Harding was a bad president.
Conan O'Brien is the king. Period.
I will follow his banner!
I don’t fear your wings man
M me
Conan is literally shaking during the end of the interview
The doctor had me dying the entire episode but when Conan went… “You’re not a doctor, aren’t you?” and he went “I should be” I just lost it😂😂😂
This is the greatest episode period. Conan has always been the best.
Red heads have a higher pain threshold!
They say Coke numbs the face...
When Conan comes to meet Tarja Halonen again btw to finland?
best hot ones EVER!!!!
Too much
For the first time, I think he is actually being himself.
Foaming at the mouth 👄
Conan looks crazier than any maniac that I have ever seen
Conan has lost his mind
Sean looks so worried at the end 😂😂
Legend
omfg im actually in tears LOL
Loved the animated reenactment of the water buffalo story 😂
Legend!
You guys aren't marketing this enough!!!!
Conan was a legend for this 🤣🤣🤣🤍🤍 He should be the host for this HAHAHHAAH
Man, I would not have envied Conan's toilet that night.
Wow ❤ Conan
Conan is the best 😂
The cosign for interviewing by the King of hosts is 🔥.  I grew up on Co Nan ❤❤ always love seeing him
This is the best episode and the biggest proof you can get through anything in life. The greatest show host of all time ✨🌹
Watching this episode yet again...another great! You should try to get Colin Jost on. He's funny too.
This was absolutely incredible. First time watching this show.
4:55 Finland is funny no matter what.
Conan has always been my favorite...but that was, at times, disgusting.
“IT’S NOT A BIT IT’S *YOUR* SHOW!” Truth broke out there for a second.
Conan O'Brien, you're a LEGEND!
23:51 the close shot on the spilled hot sauce was top notch
Conan was the funniest man of network tv, then cable tv, now he has the funniest travel show of all time.
Best episode by far !
O my GOD 😮🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌👏🙌👏  Respect!!!!!!
Have to admit lve never really liked or watched much Conan but credit where credit is due,  the dude was an insane powerhouse properly dowsing and devouring those hot wings. He may have won me over. What a fckng legend!!
Though i dont find him funny sometimes I can say he is a true showman.
Easily the best episode on Hot Ones ever!
Best episode ever. The entire "not a bit" to the last answer about reading widely. I'll watch this periodically
Okey, mad respect for Conan... He is now officially the most baller guest ever. Who can top this?
This has been my favorite interview 😂
I never thought I would see someone control the wings better than David Copperfield. Much less someone who fully admitted “I’m Irish, I have no capacity for heat”. Truly remarkable.
conan is mvp at hot ones
What was redder, Conan's hair, lips, or eyes?! Conan shows why he is still one of the best comedians alive. Not once, have I ever seen Sean lose control of a show. Absolute comedic gold. I wonder how many days he was in pain afterwards...
Hot Ones has officially established its greatest episode of all time, its greatest guest of all time, its greatest moments of all time, and most importantly, they have FINALLY found... their undisputed hot sauce KING 👑  (Who also happens to be the true King of late night)
Wild. It finally started to catch up with him, but I can’t help but wonder if he prepped with something to lessen the effects of capsaicin. Whether he did or he’s just a champ and stayed focused, the aftermath must’ve been awful! Washed his hands in it! Probably the most uncomfortable evening of his life. Id rather get tossed off a water buffalo, and I enjoy spicy food.
When your spray tan is the same color as the hot sauce.
this is the best I have ever seen
This was perhaps the most glorious episode yet. I felt things.
Conan is sofa king funny! This was epic 🤣🤣🤙🏼
First episode I’ve seen. Is it worth watching the others?
😂 this is the funniest thing ever😅
The GOAT
That man is a legend.
My favorite ep :)
I would watch a spinoff of this where Conan is the host and absolutely wrecks the set, his clothes, and his sanity every episode
Funny dude
The power of a god!
I got hot sauce coming out of my eyes! Wait...those are tears {what a complete maniac} 😂 I think if you yell MAX! Dogs will come running
I knew the Da Bomb was gonna mess with him. It messed with me lol! I did wings and then 3 Mexican pizzas with da bomb and I threw up lol
Conan is at his best when there’s no script and he’s just improving
Ok this one's my favorite 😅😅😅😅😂
To quote my hero Popeye, i am what i am
I would hate  to be his toilet after this
Conan is my favourite TV host of all time. He’s relatable, he has humility, he’s got a great sense of humour and he’s absolutely insane, in the best way possible.
I think Conan is perfectly fine. 23:00
I’d like to see how it did the next morning
18:36 absolute joker vibes
He was absolutely unhinged and I loved every second of it!😂
the music ruined the joy. please please we don't even need music as an ominous underlay.
This is the most impressive display of comedy, intelligence, masochism, self-restraint, and professionalism I've ever seen.  Conan broke the engine of the show.
Favorite. Episode. Ever.
But I gottado wing drop!!
Conan is a true goat !
hot sauce looks under its bed for Conan
The chair spins and “AHHHWOOO!”s sent me over the edge
Conan sounded like rick at the end rambling lol
"To quote my hero POPEYE, I am what I am..."😂
Why does this channel have more subscribers than Conan?
Love Conan
I havent laugh cried in 10 years. I'm also sweating.
😂
Was about time! :D
Gross
Did Conan get that jacket from the Garanimals collection?😅
Conan is an all around genius
The hosts blood froze watching Conan-man downing the hot sauces.
Holding up the high standards of Harvard....
Conan didn't wanna leave his DNA lol
I grew up watching Conan and never got tired of his comedic genius and wisdom. Thank you for making my day brighter.
You're my another father conan thanks for everything
This is definitely one of my favorites. Top 3 easy (in no particular order)
watch closely from 17:18. He turns a glass of water into a glass of milk. Amazing.
I’ve now watched this video at least 5 times, and it still hasn’t gotten old. Conan really killed this. It’s rare that I laugh out loud to anything, let alone a Hot Ones video, and this one just DESTROYS me!   Great work, Conan, and great work, Sean. This was incredible!
no hot sauce  can out perform Conan
Listen to Conan’s podcast with his doctor. Absolutely hilarious 20 mins.
amazing performance.
It's sad how many women are walking around with the same or similar mentalities
Charlie Rose show with hot wings was killer accurate 😂💀
Yes, including that it is the name of his former drummer who is Bruce Springsteen's drummer.
He said his intestines turn into acid lol!!!
lol😂!!!
This was a lesson to Sean on how to host a show
This is the whitest man I’ve ever seen
I made the horrible mistake of taking a drink of water at 16:53 and nearly drowned or spit take-ed
The best guest ever, also my favorite late night show host.
This is pure awesomeness! Kudos to Conan!
Conan is the ultimate entertainer
You know who world be entertaining to eat the wing lineup @sunnyAnderson from food network/The Kitchen
Ah, the old times before the invention of cutlery.
The three stooges thing killed me! I go back every so often just to watch that again 😂 can someone find a clip of what he's referencing, I've heard the 3 stooges sing that before bu can't find it on youtube...
That’s how it’s done. Standing ovation bravo.
Complete Rick and Morty vibes at the end😂
At the end - i love how conan's face is more red than his hair, I don't know if it's part of the "bit" or not 😂
man what a legend. Huge respect to conan for this.
On his podcast he said he could've riveted skyscrappers with his farts the next day
Conan is the absolute legend !
A true professional
4 million more since I last checked... what is the record?   Did he beat David Blaine?  Let's bring the number to 40M
Jordan schlansky next
Best episode EVER!!
prolly the most savage guest this show offered rn
Best Hotones Ever! Thanks Conan!
Conan the Barbarian. haha, well played sir. youre a leg end
He went unhinged on the last sauce  Guys...I think they made him stronger
Holy s*i* legendary....🤯.... 🔥 🥵
I love that he just turned into Shake from Aqua Teen at the end.
Without a doubt Conan O’Brien is our late night show King. He passed Carson, Lettermen… simply cuz we’re in a time where we could watch a million different shows, clips, shorts…. We choose to watch a one in a billion… Conan O’Brien.
I like how he starts so calm
BEST HOT ONES SHOW EVER
Conan was the funniest, craziest guest on Hot Ones, ever.
👑👑👑
Conan is an ANIMAL!!! He’s not human! 😂🥵
😂😂 in tears 🤣
The greatest guest in Hot Ones history, by a large margin.
Conan is a living legend
That was... extraordinary 😮
Max should merge with X and then just be called .
I can't reply to the pinned comment, but I can tell you my least favorite part was seeing  a BuzzFeed copyright notice at the end of the episode.
A good reminder why I don't watch Conan. Not sure how people find this funny. To each their own.
Kinda disturbing
And……Conan just beat every other guest ever on hot ones!    What a legend!   All hail…..Conan!
The best episode ever
This is the funniest episode ever... 🤣🤣🤣
“A Charlie Rose show where you eat hot wings” is my new favorite way of describing this show.
Greatest ever!! If only he'd taken his shirt off 😂😂😂
The wings in the pockets kept killing me 😂
Hall of fame episode for sure
Hey Guga, please check out the Good Eats episode on searing steaks on cast iron. He dry brines ribeye for 24 hrs, rubs a very thin layer of neutral oil, sears it for 1 minute each side on a 600⁰ "dry" pan, then meat thermometer in a 250⁰ oven til mid rare. I love the crust it produces!
Conan IS the Hot Ones Mount Rushmore !
Best show ever I laughed all the way
I’ve watched a lot of these, and I have never seen anyone freaking slather their face with the hottest sauces. And I hope to never see it again
That's really living. He's literally the hot sauce if the hot sauce was a person.
Sweet Jeebus.....
In a way, Letterman's cameraman got his revenge in this interview, watching conan trying to do this hip new show :p
Funniest thing I have seen in a long time!
#1
I have been Wanting, Yearning, Hoping for Conan to be on this show. Literally screamed when I saw he finally made it on and was looking forward to watching him die on the Spice because Obvi, no way he's gonna last.  But I underestimated his insane performance ability to compartmentalize pain in order to do a bit. Now I'm just impressed with his level of commitment and honestly, I'm embarrassed I doubted in the first place. Good job, dude. You sure showed me 👏👏👏
This has to be the best episode yet 😂 I could not stop laughing
Conan should be in Game of Thrones, as a dragon!
Conan's lips turned bright pink after Da Bomb. 😅
Conan!! It was hilarious at first but later I was in complete awe!! I think you're the best host of my generation, and possibly ever!!
This...has...to be the best one so far.
What a beast
😂😂😂😂 that was amazing 😂😂😂😂
4:46 I call this Torilla tavataan, okay?
I literally think Conan was high on spice there at the end.
The level of mind over matter...
absolute best show ever
BEST EPISODE EVER
Unbelievable, absolutely hilarious! Best episode ever? Mayyyyyyybeeeeee 🤔
He's crazier than I thought
New talk shows may come and go, but Conan will stay the king forever.
Holy sh! Nobody will top this!
All hail Connon 🙌🏾 The Man The Legend 🎉
All of the Hot Ones fanatics knew once Conan got to “Da Bomb” sauce that it would be hard to continue the “these wings are weak” act 🤣🤣🤣
Conan took his crazy pills this morning
This was so much more than we expected, but exactly what we needed
<3
I live in ireland, ive met a man here who thought black pepper was too spicy when he put too much in his soup.   This man is a freak of nature and deserves his face on an air pump in obamas plaza
His pain receptors were overidden by his need to entertain; he suffered for our amusement. Thank you Conan!
This made my top 3. ahahaha what a mad man!
This is the most legendary performance on wings.   So funny I’m watching it a 2nd time!   👏
Greatest episode of ALL TIME
That was insane to watch.
This is the best hot ones 😂
Conan O'Brien scares me but in like a good way i guess
NARDWUAR VID PLEASE
Thank you Conan… Thank you… 🙏🏽 😂…. For everything
"I have a new show. It's on Max. They used to call it HBO but people found that too popular." A lost it right here.
This is only the reason why the Conan O Brian is THE LEGEND. My hat off to you Sir!
He's so salty since loosing the tonight show. 😮
Best. Hot Ones. Ever.
Absolutely moved this! Conan = LEGEND!!! All around!
He went crazy when his writers went on strike
My God Conan what did you do. That was the craziest thing I've seen here. Legendary 🏆
best guest ever
The decades of seasonless Irish cuisine left Conan with iron-like taste buds.
Conan O Brian and David Blaine the best of all time!
The best moment was when Dr Arroyo was asked where did he go to medical school and he says, 1998 😂😂😂
Só good, my favorite version of this show lol
I. Love. Conan.
Love Conan and dude did this whole interview like a G!!!
Honestly, this kind of showcases how narcissistic Conan is. He's on another person's show and is trying to control everything.
I am।more confused than humored.
This show finally makes sense.
One of the best. A true showman
Conan is such a good entertainer
No matter where Conan goes, he's the host.  Best episode
Sean's like Is He Better than Me? 22:58
Conans the best
Alex Jones vibes here :D
this is how its supposed to be done!
🐐🧑🏻‍🦰
Conan is sooooo funny!!!!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow, 9.1M views in only 3 weeks, this will go down as one of the top ten Hot One's of all time!
He's still funny man 😂
His doctor. "he very affordable"
The Max/HBO joke at the end KILLED me!!!!!  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm Irish. In Ireland "a bit of spice" is more onions.
The slow but steady decent into madness is genius. Conan is one of the most brilliant minds to ever grace comedy
Doctor Arroyo is truly affordable
This has to be the greatest episode in the history of the show, I was choking of laughter for 20 minutes straight.
The face of actual fear at 22:37. First time I've seen Sean Evans actually be scared on the show.
25:20 oh no!!! bile is not neutralising the conditions in the stomach, so pepsin enzymes in the stomach are denatured and so cannot break down protein!
"To quote Popeye 'I am who I am.'"
The way Conan gave real answers and connected it with his sketch figure, making stuff that will be remembered!
That poor man
Jay Leno would have ate all the wings plain with no sauce and not have made me laugh once...wow
This is why he's the best!
Conan has won Hot Ones.
Best episode ever
The show can't get any better than this. Conan is a master who put on a master class!
Laird Hamilton and Kai Lenny, both have conquered the Wave (sick sick barrel) of Conan O'Brien. Interesting Sean has him beat 🦅  Sean is Kelly Slater in this spice!
Hands down the best episode I’ve seen so far
That was insanity! Much respect to Conan!!
Conan is insane! Epic! Great episode!
Conan is the king 😆
If u dont know Conan u may think that is little too much, however, knowing how spontaneous he is and how hot the sauces are then u will understand what happened to Conan 😂.  Sean did not even have time to warn him at all, he went fully into it.
Conan O'Brian is my favorite! There is never a dull moment with him! This made my night! Thank you!❤❤❤
Such boring questions, you failed on that. Could of asked him about all the awesome celebrities on his show but you ask about presidents and a book...
conan is THE spice lord.
Haha the very Chaplin-esque speach 😅
This guy (Conan) restores and depletes my faith in humanity... at the same time.
I love that they are hosting each other 😂
Dude is a freakin beast!!!!!🎉
That Conan version is kinda scary..😅
a google search for the word "histrionic" should, wait no, must show CONAN right there and then.
Conan O'Brien is a journalist of sorts and like many of us (writers) out there he watched in dismay as the art of the interview has been turned into a spectacle (as endearing as Sean is) by this show. Legit actors, athletes, musicians, creatives etc being forced to endure this human circus act is what Conan called out here. He overcame the ringmaster, became that disgust embodied. Yw ;)
“You’re not a doctor are you?” “I should be” 😂😂😂😂
Ok he took it a little to far 🤣
Epic
I don't think anyone can top Conan on this show at this point lol
This is the best episode of hot ones i have ever seen. Im laughing so hard. I saw conan live at the rockefellar in 2007, guest was leslie mann. He is an awesome person
What a genius.  Pulling presidential trivia too…. Thanks for a great show and episode!
Conan is a certifiable nutjob. But I think most of us already knew that.
been following you for ages. this is the absolute best! so long overdue...
I think this is the first time they added timestamps?! because there are so many highlights!
Legend
Absolutely Amazing!!
After that water buffalo story, you'd think maybe Conan had learned a lesson about being reckless in the name of comedy.  Watching him with Da Bomb, and with that Last Dab, he has clearly not learned a single thing: he is just as chaotic and reckless as ever.  And hey- y'know what- it works.
Hardest I've laughed all year.  Conan the legend 🤣
Best episode so far!
That’s true professionalism right there. Makes me wonder how it would look if he chose acting instead of comedy 😂
Absolute madness, lol
😅😂 so good. Left overs to boot , maybe for the dr
Is Conan sitting directly on the floor?  Conan's a tall dude, and they've got him and Sean at eye level!
How is not one talking about the consistency in putting the wings in his pocket  lol
CALL THE WIFE 😂😂😂
Jesus lol, that was off the rails. Conan is a madman. I never liked his show growing up, but the guy is fking crazy.
This was the best ever !! He’s by far the best !! I love him more now , he’s amazing and really work it , he’s always going to give a great show !! Thanks !!! This is another level !! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Conan doing a Ric Flair “Wooo”. My life is now complete.
I'm happy the music is quiet.
Yo this hot sauce got Conan sloppy😂😂
Conan.   You are the GOAT.
I worked on the site across the street where Conan spot welded 65 rivets. Our Union has never been stronger!
Conan the Barbarian
Warren G. Harding😂😂😂
Sean I made it back for a third time 😂😂😂 how is this possible
Only time I ever laughed at Conan. Good work.
Nicely done Conan!
Sean! Please make an episode with Dr. Aroyo!
The funniest episode lol
I think Conan emphasized that comedy can be found everywhere because he is tired of new comedy only focusing on current divisive issues. He’s 100% right. I am sick of BOTH woke and anti-woke comedy and politics everywhere.
Conan is a living, breathing comedy tornado
Conan has always been the funniest late night host . Glad to see him back . Bravo !
Conan is so the Final Boss  XD
The amount of makeup is insane
I just laughed so hard, I cried.  I miss my Coco.
The only show that comes even close to this is Lil Nas.  Conan is a king among men.  Human to the advanced level.
Conan O'brien YOU'RE A LEGEND!!!!!!!!!!!
Best episode. Actually would be a decent idea to monitor the guests heart rate and body temp throughout the show. Display on the screen any changes
conan is the goat
His doctor went to one of the best doctor schools in the world
He looks like Lady Elaine Fairchilde from Mr. Rogers😂😂😂😂
Best Hot Ones YET
"Where did you go to medical school?" "In 1998"
I swear at the end there Conan started sounding like Master Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force 😂
Can i be a taste tester? Lol (i love hot wings)
Didn’t even make the rookie mistake of touching his eyes. Just touched everywhere else on his face. Truly impressive episode.
Genius has no off switch.
Did anyone notice the snot drip down after eating Da Bomb?
Absolute LEGEND
What an episode🎉
I think its fair to say that Conan needs to come out with his own hot sauce.
Coolio would be proud.
Does anyone know why Conan wanted to keep the chicken wings and why he put them in his coat pocket?😂
Best episode ever.
If commited to the bit was a person is all Conan is giving off. He was a champ this episode and able to keep it together. Almost taking over the show in a way only Conan can respectfully do. It feels like the Sean and Conan dynamic is so amazing.
His eyes got so red! He is genius and will suffer for his art.
What an absolute professional
This is awesome
Luke Combs would be a good guest
THIS IS COMEDY YOU FREEEEAAKS
Best Hot Wings Episode EVER!!!! Love Conan and always will!!! Love his show Conan O'Brien Must Go! ❤❤❤ Love ya Conan!!!
I cannot believe this man is not hosting the Tonight Show right now. This generation would LOVE his anarchy
Conan will always be the Man
God that was so good
Conan just released his "behind the scenes" thoughts, what happened during, and after this scene.  Please Sean, can you also make a video on what went through your head during this episode? And if there's anything cut that's fun for viewers. Especially dr Arroyo stuff
Coco, Let's Go!!!!!
I didn't know you could get high on hot sauce but, based on Conan's behavior, I guess you can.  What a nut!!!!  LOL
The amount of pain Sean is in at 22:41 is absolutely hilarious
I love that Conan has two new shows now, but hopefully he gets more entertaining guests on other episodes than this boring bald guy.
Gingers really do have a different kind of pain tolerance
The da bomb got him lit. Off the rails after that.
Conan don't care! (See Video) I love him.
Conan is EveryMan.
Glad to see people finally starting to realize the comedy genius in Conan 20 yrs later. This is only a glimpse of his entire repertoire of an amazing career.
Conan needs an Emmy for this episode
You can tell Conan wanted to do his show so much longer than he could
Better get Dr Nick, Conan
Sean’s look of sheer terror at Conan’s last wing is perfection
Conan doesn't dissapoint. Never saw him that colored from the face tho, but I'm happy he didn't got harmed during the show and to saw him again. It's been years in here Finland and Team CoCo have only old footage. Was a pleasure, thanks! <3
I just don’t get the guy. He’s obviously very good at what he does to be in the game for as long as he has but I struggle to find anything he does or says even slightly funny.
Sean Evans: "Sweet, we finally got Conan."  Conan up in the rafters of the Hot Ones: "Oh baby, are you getting CONAN."   Seriously, Conan's maniac energy with Sean trying to keep it light and casual is the funniest interchange between Sean and a guest ever on this series.
This was a masterclass in entertainment
Gooosh Conan is a beast!!
I’ve seen every episode of this show and I could say this one is the ultimate!!!!!!!! Coco 4 ever!!!!!! 🤯🤯🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Somehow, what got me most was conan swearing.  All the rest was good old witty, intelligent but goofy and conany entertainment. The man delivers.
When Sean rolled out the red carpet and Conan is just ... Milk everywhere, "I've got a show! It's on Max! They used to call it HBO but that was too popular!!"  I nearly died of laughter. So perfectly unhinged.
I feel like I just went through something.
Absolute train wreck of an interview if ever there was one! Conan Da'goat! The look of concern, disgust mixed with pure admiration on Sean's face is peak Conan!
This guy went to harvard. Just to remind you
It was later mentioned on Conan’s podcast that the only thing that would hurt him more than the hot sauce was not getting the attention he wanted. This guy will do whatever it takes to give his fans a laugh. His dedication makes him the best.
KING 👑
Sixty-something Conan bears a striking resemblance to John Wayne.
Best HOT ONES EVER!!!
Best episode EVER!
Wow this is one of the best things Ive ever seen.
Conan has done funniest podcast with Dr aroyo on his channel team Coco
I've never heard Conan drop a F Bomb.
The absolute most crazy episode of all Hot Ones seasons. Conan O'Brien going absolutely full on madman while devouring more hot sauce than any other guest. Can't stop smiling!
Petition to get Amy Poehler on here
Watch the show with conan in Norway and Thailand etc. It's hilarious
Anyone else watching this episode from the UK and wondering which parts are supposed to be funny?
Why doesn't this have 50+ million views yet... people need an education on comedy.
Conan is a living legend.
Just... How?
One of the best shows I've seen anywhere, since longer than I can remember - awesome stuff!
If Conan weren't a comedian, he'd probably be in an institution.
Oh my gods!!!! This great!!!
Probably the hardest ive ever laughed in my life 😂 & the funniest Hot Ones episode to date! 😂
How wild must it have been to cut out the bit where suddenly all the sauces are tipped over.
Conan is using coping mechanism so hard to deal with his choices
Just Genius. Love Conan!
A true comedic genius.
Wow.. This was something else. I started to get concerned for Conan once he started drinking. Which is not something I thought I'd say. Or see. Wow..
Bro is chronically unfunny
positively bonkers. completely unhinged. absolutely hilarious. how could this be topped?
This is definitely my favorite episode 😂
Oh there was a firework display alright, in the bathroom
Just as unhinged as I expected. Time may pass but Conan stays the same lol
Jay Leno could never…
Conan Commits
Conan is always comedy gold!
What a guy.   Best one yet
fkin savage. If real impressive.
I love Conan’s old timey references. He teaches me about history ❤❤❤❤
Thee best interview hands down!
I've never seen anyone's face shrink like that. its like his head is pulling in his mouth to protect itself from his idiocy!
this was What If Rick Sanchez in real life
This dude is the greatest comedian of all time. He literally stole his show and took over without *any* effort.
god i love me some conan o'brien <3
He would be a great joker
Conan is on a whole new level of crazy, man is untamable
Best episode ever ! Wow! I actually clapped along!
Im convinced Conan pulled the old Homer Simpson wax in mouth trick.
Ya'll need to get the name of the doctor correct in the title of the chapters. He went to doctor school so he deserves to have his name correct.
Conan is crazy, but now this for sure confirms the guest sauces are watered down
My favourite moment was from 0:00 until 27:20. Conan destroyed hot ones this was amazing! 😂👏
The Boss level Hot Wings has landed
Conan is lucky to hav brought d world's most affordable doctor, Dr.Arroyo here.   Conan is still alive bcoz of Dat chocking Dr artoyo gave to him, which must hav nullified DBomb&Sauces effects
Conan must have a will of pure iron, because I've tried Beyond Insanity and unless you happen to have been born without taste buds or something no one just slurps it down unaffected. It hurts. Really, really hurts.
Nice to see Conan again.
This is literally the greatest thing I have ever watched. Absolute legend.
What a legend!
It was nice of Conan to have Sean on his show.
Writer’s strike era Conan was so off the rails and I loved every minute of it
Best one yet. 👍👍👍
This was insane -- I love it
Conan proves he ain’t as soft as some think
A maniac😂 I just adore Conan O'Brian. The gradual spiral into chaos was everything🤣🤣🤣
Conan looks like he went blind around 23:40
13.3 million subs on the channel and this video has been watched 9M times that’s amazing
The way he was eating the wings was disgusting 😂 but Conan is hilarious
He didnt even put any hotsauce in his milk? Weak.
Conan trying to distract himself from the burn is the best. Go Conan!
Conan is a legend.
Man I think that Mr Evans was on for the ride on this one
Conan just posted an interview with Dr Arroyo to his channel (Team Coco).  They talk about Dr Arroyo's medical background and Hot Ones.
17:13 hahhahahahahaha this part always gets me hahahahha
Sixth time watching this episode
That hair... fffffsssss
Da Bomb bombed in this one. He Is a barbarian after all.
goated episode!
I love this show, but my spice limit is Franks Chilies & Lime sauce. I managed to bulk buy some before they stopped selling it (in the UK) and I am now desperate to find a replacement. Can anyone out there recommend something?
24:05 really wish he’d wiped his mouth before this speech lol
He is the toughest one so far, he made Coolio look like a little girl 😂
Conan, I don't want to be whoever is the next star to be in Hot-Ones after Mr. O'Brien😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
meh, love this stuff. not but yes, go for it
That was heroic.
This was such a fun episode, Conan definitely suffered for the bit and I got one appreciate that so much.
😂😂😂😂😂funniest thing
There will never be a guest that tops that performance. Simply brilliant.
First We Feast asked: "What was your favorite moment from the episode?"  Audience: Yes
funniest show yet xD love ya conan
Conan is 💯
Is the water buffalo alive?
Trying to convince myself that we are worthy of this
Conan's fear that he will be cloned from his saliva compels him to take his chicken bones with him.
Conan is the best, he did his researched for this interview so cute ❤
Conan O’Brian, a master of his craft - which is entertainment. I applaud you 👏 👏👏👏
conan has always been the best, hands down amazing
The fact that Conan answered some of his questions with sincerity shows that he really respects the host. ❤
When Hot Ones is good, it *REAL* good.
It's gratifying to see someone who is genuinely intelligent, take control of the show and dominate pseudointellectual pinheads.
Conan seems like one of those guys that could wear sweat pants and a sweat shirt and still be all class. There’s a charm to him, always real and from the heart. Conan is always Conan, doesn’t drastically change his personality depending on who's interviewing him or who he’s interviewing
So red, so perfect.
I think I’ve watched this every day since it “dropped” that’s what the kids say
Conan is so good at putting other people over. Even when he's killing it he takes the time to elevate everyone with him
shots fired at Burr lol
Conan is incredible <3
“To quote my hero Popeye…”
I really wish the doctor guy wrapped it up by saying "oh this is a range finder, not a thermometer.". Missed oportunity.
Honestly, this should have been the series finale. How do you top this?
Lady Gaga next please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Best episode hands down
“I don’t fear your wings man….”
This man is showbiz people, the effort that he puts on hair and make up is beyond vogue and the consistency he has is unmatched. Jordan Slansky or whatever his name is could never
Petition to cast Conan O’Brien as replacement for Walton Giggins as the fallout mutant
Conan is the physical manifestation of :And computer... Turn off all safety measures.
Is he talking about Shane Gillis?
2:22 for those who don't know, those bones are sold at auction for 7 Billion Dollars.
Bro busted out an 🎱 before the shoot 🤣
Conan’s follow-up podcast with Dr. Arroyo is side-splitting.
I used to hate Conan but I grew to love him and his show very fast !! Back when he first started!!
Conan is a genius and an amazing comic!
Best episode ever
Best Hot Ones Ever!  Nuff Said!
Tutorial: How to destroy a toilet.
Conan is legend 💯💥💯
I miss conan so much
👍👍👍
by far the best hot ones ive watched  well done conan
I always say put it in your pocket, and keep it for later!
Conan always been the goat
Drank da bomb and the last dab 😂
Hands down the best interview on here I've watched! 🤣🤣🤣
He drank it
I know now why I watch him. 😂
CONAN 2028
I've seen this episode probably 5x 😂 "You're not a Dr are you?" " I should be" 💀
I love that Conan was so real and couldn't be BOUGHT so yes they did fire him and brought in Jimmy Fallon haha, Fallon and Kimble are sooo BOUGHT.. there the biggest SNOWFLAKE LEFTIST HAHAHA but Kimble is worse his eyes will tear up then go on a 10 or 15 minute bi*ch rage ...
Im SHRIEKING about Dr Arroyo putting the stethoscope on Sean's tongue and just saying "not good" and walking away 😂 Conan was great but his doctor was amazing 👌
This is up there with Dave Grohl and Shaq with fantastic interviews  And that water buffalo art was 🤌 I was screaming the whole story.  Dr. Arroyo needs a Nobel prize 😂 Only on the merit of being hilarious.
Best episode ever
Conan got that dawg in him lol
Conan killed this. Amazing to see two legendary hosts come together like this. mui piquante
Best 1 ever.
I freaking love Conan! What a legend!
That’s a real showman.
Best guest ever.
hes outdone Steve-O
I love Conan so much ❤
He is LEGEND
My favorite guests are the ones who watch the show. The vibe always has an excitement. Conan took it to a whole other level and had me laughing from my gut. 😂😂😂
The only other comedian I think that could handle this and take it to this level is probably Jim Carrey  😂
I'm happy to see Andre Agassi doing what he loves in his retirement. The fact that he got Tilda Swinton on is just a meeting of the minds. Serious talent collision here.
LOUD doesn't mean funny
Only Stevo had more sauce than CoCo, but Conan handled it better.
9:30   Woah, man...
Legend!!
This was the best episode of HOT ONES ever!
Conan going to the extreme as always, but he just shamed everyone that has been in this show before! 🔥
you should go was hilarious
❤
My God man it’s Jason Borne
Id say no one has ever done the show better then Conan.
FUNNIEST EPISODE EVER😂
Man I thought that was Sean Evans himself behind the counter
I’ve rewatched this so many times….everytime I need a good laugh 😂
This show no longer belongs to First We Feast.. Hot Wings is now Conan's show. Bravo!!!
“Drinking” the sauces straight from the bottles (whether for real or not) was so epic and original. Absolute classic.
I know he regretted this, but what a friggin beast!
This was great, well done everyone
Never disappoints. Conan is forever smazing.
THE GOAT, NO DEBATE
Cringy, egotistical, bloated.
this may be conan’s best bit
Make no mistake, this was yet another water buffalo for Conan, and I am thankful.
Best one ever!!😂😂😂😂
Great finale 👏 😂 👏
Conan O'Brien is the man!
Excellent camera work by that guy
Conan was to raw he said a lot that the "producers" didn't like, he said facts instead of feelings, he couldn't be bought.. you watch Jimmy Fallon and Conan who took 9ver Conans show.. Jimmy Fallon is bought and jimmy kimball IS 1000% BOUGHT SNOWFLAKE LEFTIST he go purely off feelings
he should be the next Joker in the Batman series
conan killed bea arthur, who knew?
Pro= he didn’t get it in his eyes
“That’s right! My intestines have turned into acid and I can still remember the plug. That’s a professional.” 😂🤣 I am crying  Best episode ever. H/T to the greatest late night tv host of his generation.
The wings are hot but Conan burnt down this place!
While I have enjoyed watching both Hot Ones and Conan's various media endeavors, I think this is one of the worst Hot Ones ever. Someone should tell Conan that being loud and obnoxious is not the same as being funny, and as a long time talk show host he should know better than to rudely try to upstage the host.
never laughed so hard at an episode. conan is a gem
This made me cry bruh
Conan isn't human he did NOT keep his composure through that!
No way, iam in 😭 😂
Mental toughness 101 with Conan.
The zoom in on da bomb leaking 😂😂
Unbelievable. Pure entertainment
😂
How is this not the most viewed episode already?
Why is nobody talking about his ridiculous water buffalo story??? Just the animation of his crew running away in terror and the buffalo slipping on the floor had me dying!!! If there was actual live footage of this epic moment, someone please find it and upload it ASAP...
i love you guys both of you
Get Ryan Raynolds for deadpool 3
I love Hot Wings, but man the background music is annoying
I never been so impressed in my whole life 😂
22:56 That is real concern in his eyes. He knows Conan has made a huge life mistake 'for the bit'.    That said...Conan nailed it.
There goes my hero 😂❤❤❤
Hilatiois
Conan good. Me like Conan.
get louis ck
Conan is a hero 🔥
This is the best episode ever, and it’s not close.
I love Conan man
wow i guess i should have expected conan to go crazy
This episode felt 1o minutes long
I would have thought that Conan already was at peak point in his achievements, but I think he went even higher in this one. Incredible interview
i love conan this is so funny
The only talk show host that make me laugh, unlike other with political agenda
He is the greatest guest to ever appear.Greatest of all time.
Conan is a savage, the consummate professional!😂😂😂😂
YOU GUYS, SHOULD BRING ON TONY TODD!  why?  Because he actually makes his own brand, of hotsauce.
I need to know more about that Doctor Arroyo… fascinating character. Get him next.
Wow, Conan's performance was downright disgraceful.  This is going to be legendary.
So this video has become one of your most watched videos. A testimony to how great Conan as an entertainer is and also how much he is loved around the globe, as someone like me from India is his serious admirer and fan. He also praised Sean even on many platforms after the show.
legend <3
The gayest host of all time. Not Conan.
STILL THE ONE TRUE KING CONAN O'BRIEN!!
Dude he Coolio'd Da Bomb on a wing. That's boss level OG right there.
24:48 channeling his inner Samuel L Jackson
Pure insanity, the man is a legend. Also, he’s right about Sean.
Messiest Hot Ones ever, lol.
Wow.  Incredible episode.  And effective, I did go watch Conan Must Go (And it was good too).
Conan is legend
This might be the literal definition of high on hot 😂
Nao teve efeito nenhum
we need an episode where conan interviews sean!
My favorite episode yet! This is up there with the Steve o interview!!
Is he really a doctor? 😂
Hands down best episode. Conan is a genius.
Conan would make a good Batman’s Joker
It'll be a long time until this interview is topped.
Oh My God
Conan just straight up asserting dominance
What a legend 🫡
Conan is like a final boss. Unstoppable.
What a legend.
Sean was quite terrified at about 23:00
It would be great if Conan was that messy an eater in everyday life.
I been watching Conan most of my life at this point. I would stay up to watch him on school nights. I remember so many obscure skits like The Slipnuts
Conan WON this show. Some guests had previously raised the bar by double dipping in the last sauce or by eating the wings whole... Conan obliterated everything!!
i seen every video, but that one is in the top 3, what a energy.
Best episode ever no discussion
6:25“the other guy, I don’t know where he is” he probably means someone else but deadass, Jay Leno popped into mind and immediately i said “oop”
Definitely worthy of a side by side screen capture "before and after"
Hands down the best episode you've ever done. Bravo to Conan, the real GOAT
Conan has been the best guest!   Choking fake Dr Brutal delivery of taunting Sean and then committing to finish. Beautiful comedy Great Interview!
DID I ASK?
conan obrien for president 2024 🇺🇲
NEW GOAT HOT ONES EPISODE BUTTON ------------------------>
I love Conan! 😂
Wow 23 seasons. Is there not a big break between seasons.
Mr Barbecue from Haiti could do him some hot arms and legs.
what season is this thanks!
😂❤
Amazing! 👏 👏👏👏👏 I didn’t see that coming, towards the last third I felt like if Robin had done an episode this would have been similar to that, truly impressive and brilliant wow!
Best guest ever 😂😂😂
HOW
lol that man is crazy
When he put the stethoscope for 0.5 sec on Sean’s tongue and said „it’s not good“ I lost it. Got me completely unaware :D
What a monster!
Thank you Conan. You win hot one's.
My favorite episode of any season!! This was freaking Amazing!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭
22:05 I love how Conan clarifies if the sauce is pure pepper and continues to gnaw the wing like a nervous gerbil
24:47 lol
Conan is amazing, his hairs were definitely on fire; and I am not referring to the ones on top of his head! lol...
What is with the music? I don’t care for it at all.
Sean's/the crew's "ughh" when he drinks the last dab from the bottle was perfect.
Conan is comedy. Absolutely amazing!
Haha that cutie is so short
Best. Episode. Yet.
Someone tell Conan he has a schmeckle on his upper lip!
Conan absolutely crushed this episode. He wins the title. Holy smokes!!!!!!!❤🎉
Conan O'Brien is a gem, a rare find.  One of those comics who is at his best doing improv.  Can tell he loves to make people laugh.  He's good with people as well, doesn't need to be offensive to be funny.
My tongue is so scared.
Wing drop 😂
i. love. conan.
❤❤
You are a good interviewer.
Hands down my favourite episode to date ❤😂😂😂😂😂❤
Best guest ya probably ever gonna get
Best. Episode. Ever.
Absolutely genius.
We don’t deserve Conan.
Ive been watching him since the 90's before I was even 13, at the time I said he's the best host of all time, & will always be, but before I really knew anything, & I'd only seen Leno & Letterman..    Now I still say the same thing, _Especially_ now
What a legend 😂
Hands down but Hot Ones ever!
both these white dudes got no lips. lol the exterior pain is non existent
😂im crying
Did my man's just drink the last dab 😂
I feel like they had fake sauces for him and it was part of the bit
Felt like I was watching a living Marx Brother
One of the greatest comedian and late night show host who goes out of his way and makes comedy so unique. Adapts to every situational comedy   Love you sir Conan O’Brien
I wish Sean would have asked about Norm Macdonald.
By the last wing, Sean looks so very worried that he’s about to watch Conan fully self-destruct and drop on his show. “I’M FINE.”
I'm glad that Conan and the water buffalo parted ways on good terms. lol
He has reached Scoville Nirvana
Precious. All around. Wonderful entertainment
The memeability alone in this is amazing
I wish Arroyo would have tried to listen to conan's tongue after Sean's lol
Conan is the best lol this was amazing!
"This is not going well" is only funny when it is, in fact, going well.
im watching this for the 2nd time today, third in total. im still laughing the same, conan is a comedic legend.
He's just showing off. Look at his face 😮
By far the best finale since Stone Cold Steve Austin 😂
Conan is the best. He was seamlessly going between comedy and answering the questions sincerely. And, btw, eating hot wings. Wow. O'Conan Rules!!!
one of the best episodes of the entire show
I usually don't laugh out loud by myself from a YouTube but boy did that change..my favorite video so far
Conan is Gangster AF!!!! Lol
Conan killed Bea Arthur. I’m no longer a fan.
bro... respect! xD
I gasped seeing him use so much da bomb
Conan >EVERYONE
I just need to marry a hot funny redhead. Life would b good 😌
Bravo
That was sooo good
I'm so proud of Sean.
he looks like he is on coke
I…love Conan 🥰😍!!!
Dude this was EPIC ! LOL
Invite Michael Jordan
Redheads have less pain receptors. I believe this may be the reason for this mans success in this.
jim carrey  next
One of the best episodes yet!!  Conan went bananas!!!  Love that dude.
(( great editing ))
The chicken wings in his pocket is killing me 😂😂😂
Dude just gave himself an ulcer for the spectacle
I want to look this good at 61
Conan going full Dennis Hopper here.
the music in the background is a bit unnecessary don't we think?
The G.O.A.T!
Best episode ever
I never comment on these things, but I must admit that this the best episode of hot ones ever. Kudos to you Conan on bringing and living out comedic gold for us to enjoy.
"I'M FINE!" should be a be a meme. that is pure gold.
Well, if Paul Rudd raised the Bar, Conan f***ed it!
Part of why this is genius - CONAN highlights the show, above himself. Even within his absurdity and hilarity. He respects the show first. I LOVE IT.
Two of my favorite talk show hosts :)
This episode cannot be topped ☝🏻🥵🥵🤣🤣🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Conan, when I watch your trip to Palestine, you expressed your showbiz ambitions very well there, which should be embossing. showbiz should remove the biz from Show. not so proud of you. BIZ is genocide.
I love how Conan was a true gentleman and a complete maniac at the same time.
Conan went off the rails....... 😂🤣😂🤣😂
Conan is the Joker
God he's such an idiot (the smartest idiot ever) love him
26:20 Can we get Conan to voice over Goku now 😂😂😂
We're trademarking "like cool whipped cream on an August afternoon" for our new slogan
Not since Robin Williams have I seen a comedian commit to a bit as much as Conan O'Brien
what a pro, this is incredible
Sean looked so scared
The brilliance of Jose Arroyo at 16:30
Just a true showman and entertainer.  From day.  Glad he isn't on network television so he can just be funny and not political.
This is literally what "full send" looks like
i haven't laughed so hard since...
For a guy who has been routinely criticized for being too white, this performance is legendary
Tune in for the sequel in the bathroom...
all talkie no eat
The JOY in Sean's eyes. <3
my god, 30 minutes and it passed by in a flash. Conan is incredible
So amazing
OK,  that might be the best episode yet. Conan is *(almost literally)* on fire!
I have a show. It's on MAX.
Hopefully he'll get better.
Best episode ever. I seem to be suffering sympathetic second-degree burns to my face from watching this.
incredible, outstanding, the t!ts!. just really well done and incredibly enjoyable for all viewers!
You Brought the legend to the show and now nobody could surpass this.
Great as always Conan. Would have loved a Jordan Schlansky question too.
I’m cry laughing😂
This is what happens when an Irish man has spicy food for the first time.
the only funny late night show guy
Conan far surpasses any other guest, EVER! What a crazy dude.
Conan is such a force of nature.
The best guest ever.    Hysterical😂😂😂❤❤❤
My first Hot Ones epizode, best promo ever, can't stop lauging about Max promo in the end
Conan is a national treasure.
I haven't laughed so hard in like 5yrs
Conan is an entertainment genius
Pretty sure Conan's got a colonoscopy after this and that's why he went full hot head with the sauces 😂
they need to have more than hot sauce, as there's a build-up to there but then nothing again
The Shows over!! No one can follow this, it's done.
Conan is one of the greatest humans alive!
Two weeks in and this episode has almost cracked the top 50 Hot Ones episodes. Really shows the true power of what is the man, the myth, the legend, Conan O’Brien.
I couldn’t stop laughing from the beginning till the end. 10/10 thank you for the great laughs and good time. 😂
The water buffalo story reminded me of the chimp scene from the movie "Nope"
Legendary
this is the funniest hot ones episode ive watched
I'll tell you what?  Coming from the Charlie Rose interview to this is like an acid trip no one has ever had.
Conan is, and always has been, the greatest show out there. He’s a one of a kind talent.
BOT having a late life crisis
masterpiece
With this show, Conan has just catapulted himself into god mode in comedy!! Conan, you're the effing man!!!
Masterpiece
Give a Emmy to Dr Arroyo 😂👏 for best supporting actor!!!!
Sean to Conan in between scenes: "I bet you live 4 more years tops"
The editing is special on this one. There might be some back and forth single camera action but they knew the gold was all on conan with maybe a wideshot or two. The performer had the stage and you edited it to that. great stuff!
Conan was completely unhinged. I don’t know if this is great or awful.
he'll be in the toilet for a week after that 😲
Anyone else getting Rick Sanchez vibes from Conans ranting hahaha
Conan has one or the best senses of humor in the world.
Conan the barbarian you're a God sir 😂
Amazing! How good would robin williams be here?! Rip.
I couldn't even control my laughter
Ohh I’m so happy Conan did this!! I have been waiting!! 🎉
He absolutely planned this appearance for years, he must have. His performance is too good.
Just heard him say that when he goes to the dentist he isn’t affected as much from the numbing shots.  Wasn’t sure if he was joking, but now I don’t think so.
Oh wow, this was worth the long wait, what a guy!!!
Conans absolute maniac. Im crying
PLS GET STEVE HARVEY ON PLS PLS
Dude’s an absolute terminator 🤣
Conan be like a real life meat canyon toon
“Was it a 4 year school?” “It was supposed to be.”. LOL
bros giggling getting me
Conan O'Brien is UNHINGED LOL
i dont... wait what?? i cant
I wonder if they'll ever get Johnny Depp to do an episode. He's had quite a fascinating life that would make for a great interview
I used to eat hot sauce on anything now I can barely handle pepper jack cheese. I just felt it was important the world knew about this!
He who controls the spice controls the universe. I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. -Denis Villeneuve, Fn
If he was acting this would be an Academy award winning performance.
The best one yet.
This is absolutely gold.
Clearly Conan coated the inside of his mouth with wax before he came on this show. The heat doesn't phase him at all.
Conan is the goat of late night tv the best there every was 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
W video
conan is the greatest lol
Phenomenal 🎉
Hands down the most legendary performance in the history of this show. Conan is the king.
Best guest ever
Respect earned, Bravo Conan… Its called Endorphin Rush 😂
He drank a candle right before the show.
asd
Just because of this, max is back on the roaster
His lips and face have GOT to be NUMB!
Favourite Episode Ever
Wow, not just the funniest episode ever (shout out to Dave Grohl), perhaps one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
Did Conan give yall some Rick Sanchez vibes there at the end?
So good
This did not disappoint. Way to go guys lol
LOL whatever Conan decides to do, he is the main character no matter what, it is truly Conan's world and we are all living in it
A true showman
Conan is just the best
Best hot wings guest, ALL SEASONS.
Finland mentioned! 😂 🇫🇮
I've watched a lot of HO's, Conan is the the best.
A brand new suede jacket... give it up for Sean!
The best one yet!
Total commitment. Conan remains amazing.
I think it's safe to say he was the best guest all year 😂😂😂
The Richard Nixon impression had me in tears 😂😂😂
I saw Robin Williams!
ALL HAIL THE KING !!!!!!!!!!
Great episode, and next up his bathroom screams will be heard from outer space
Conan is a GOD amongst common men! May he live forever and continue to make me laugh until the day I die!!
Ending with Charlie Caplin Final Speech vibes
You've seen an unstoppable force meet an immovable object. But have you seen an unstoppable force meet ANOTHER UNSTOPPABLE FORCE?!
LOVE COCO! One of my favorite ppl to watch 🧡
That's it, Conan just won Hot Ones, game's over. Shut it all down.
Nah, Conan went crazy 😭🔥🔥🔥🔥
“That other guy”  Lol
Why does Conan look butch
Doctor is an amazing bit
Conan is the goat!!!
The camera shot that includes the bottle of Da Bomb slowly glugging out onto the table after Conan knocked it over was a beautiful visual cherry on top of this gift of an episode. Even Da Bomb knew it had been bested. 💣
Conan going off on that wing and then cut to the fearful wonderment in sean's eyes had me on the floor
Conan O'Brien is the definition of "Show MF'in business" and I haven't laughed this hard in ages. What a fantastic episode 💜
This was the BEST episode EVER!!!! CONAN IS A GOD!!!
Idk how yall are gonna top this one 😂😂😂😂
as a 24 yo, it was fire
Fantastic
Conan's jean jacket is pretty dope.
Why didnt y’all play “Hurt” by Johnny Cash during the last dab exp
"What's wrong with me, why can't I feel?" had me.  He's soo high.
Gotta tip ur hat for Conan, he took the fight to Sean😂
3rd time watching this ......I cant be alone on this 😅
Man literally drank the hot sauce😅😅
This is the absolute BEST EVER episode of this show
I'm sweating just watching this.
I think I peed a little 🤣😂
His lips end up so red. 😂😂
That was kinda gross but I laughed
Conan is absolutely unmatched. He was put on this planet to entertain and few people have the natural confidence and charisma that conan has.
Gingers have a high pain threshold lolllll!! Conan is the man
Conan vs Hot One’s Wings FIGHT!! Winner:  Conan. Fatality.   Flawless Victory…
Okay that was fun
👑
He just drank it lol
I can watch this over and over lol ❤😂
Conan simply is, built different
Such a good episode and now everyone will say "I give Conan 4 years tops"
Hot Ones is having an existential crisis after this. Conan smoked this show completely. The 🐐forreal.
I've heard people say Conan would NOT do any-thing for love. But he just did that. ... Yes, he just did that.
They don't make 'em like that anymore.
Late night talk shows died when this man left... 100%
Canon event which brought us Assweld
The best!
"I never saw spice until I was about 52 years old" made me laugh so hard I don't know why.
Top 5 episode lol
This the uhh... 7th time I've watched this episode hahaha.
Easily the best episode ever, Conan showing us why he is a true great.
I wished that whenever Sean asks us "what's going on, everyone," he would let us answer!
why does he have such weak arms.
I feel sorry for who had to use the bathroom after him. 😂
Conan, you are so funny and entertaining. You are now a grand master of hot wings.
i'm sorry to be the one saying it, but he's not funny at all here. trying too hard. it was just a weird and disgusting show this time.
BEST EPISODE EVER
Easily the best hot ones I've ever seen. I love Conan and all...but I was not expecting him to crush this as hard as he did 😂😂
This episode will never be topped. The peak has been reached.
22:57
Conan got Sean cussing this is a first 😅😂😂😂😂
Probably the funniest one ever.
thats it, conan won hot ones!
Jay Leno is going to be so confused when he finds all those gnawed wings in his pockets
You gotta get jb smoove on here
The segment starting at 7:32 is “Dr Ro Royal”. This is due to Conan saying his name with a mouth full of chicken.
Hands down best episode of Hot Ones. THE BEST
Every time I feel I really do love Conan, he goes ahead and does something like this and you gotta love him more!! What an amazingly entertaining episode
Take note youngens in entertainment...this is what an entertainment Jedi Master looks like. "These are not the spices you are looking for" /handwave
This tourcher!
That is THE number 1 Hot Ones!!!
That was genius.
Yup, Conan is the best.
Good Lord....
Pope of Chili Town
1998 and Out of State!  LOL
Can you image his bathroom experience after this
The first bit sauce I ever had was Mad Dog 357 original. 357,000 Scoville units. I felt like my throat closed up and it wasn’t the pain at all, I’m not sure I even felt what you could call pain, it was all the parts of my upper torso, neck, throat, mouth, and face tightening up and closing off that freaked me out. It was fairly panic-inducing. But after that experience I feel like I could do a lot of these sauces and always think “well, it’s not as bad as it was last time”. There’s a peace in that. Conan and Sean can now probably say that themselves (although I’m sure Sean has gone way, way beyond what was in this video — in fact I know he does when he gets together with Chili Klaus!)
Love Conan. Best to ever do it
The GOAT
Thank you Conan that was the best episode ever giving Robin Williams vibes ❤
Conan is now the GOAT
"Call the wife!" - horribly funny!
Dr. Arroyo 🤣🤣🤣
He made the show his own. ❤
hes the man, the guy, the legend
He ate my soul
Just an amazing human.  Imagine what the world would be like if he was the norm.
Legend
I’ve never clicked on a video so fast
Amazing! Thank you, Conan. 😂
Amazing performance by a consumate professional.  Love Conan.  Love Sean.  One of the beast episodes ever!
This was my favorite Hot Ones so far xD
hillarious
Conan O'brien...he's one of our own🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Conan is hilarious 😂😂❤ there were times during this video that I couldn’t help but say “Conan!!”
Sorry, not physiologically possible.  No way does he eat wings drink suaces like this and just continue to talk.
Conan and Brand are top 2
GOAT
"whats wrong with me why cant I FEEL?!" LOL
Conan having a bit is just amazing. I love him.
Now we know that DA BOMB is scared of CONAN! CONAN THE DEFINITIVE FINAL BOSS OF ENTERTAINMENT!  CONANDO RULES!!!!!!!!
The man is an absolute monster.
23:50 that shot 😂😂😂
10/10😂😂😂😂
That was awesome!  Conan is the best.
I absolutely love Conan O’Brien. He seems like a genuinely good dude. Plus he’s funny…
Conan is a BEAST.  He is the LEGEND OF HOSTS. Look how much camera time he had, the confidence to commit, passing his knowledge to Sean.   Long Live Conan!
😅
'check on my friend'  'it's not good'
9:00
Conan O'Brien is a BEAST
The look of regret when Conan said “I’m not going to lie” after Da Bomb 😂😂 literally cried laughing
This was incredible
Greatest episode ever!!
"...they used to call it HBO, but people found that too popular"
Favorite episode of ALL TIME. Funny!!! Wow!
GOLD!
That ending was absolutely nuts. What a mad man. I can't imagine how painful that was and he kept in check. I'd say it caused some slight insanity but that's just Conan.
Salvation is found in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ loves you all very deeply 🔥🔥🔥
I had to see this again after Conan's podcast earlier. I just realised I was laughing so hard I missed 20% of the jokes. This is a joke/second episode. Hard to believe this will be topped! Conan is the GOAT.
this dude just straight up choked him
i have to say this was the funniest episode to date and I almost didn't go back to watching it past wing 3. what a legend
CALL THE WIFE
Well done. ^<^
Conan is the GOAT. Hot wings guy was genuinely scared at the end.
Commitment to the bit while still being legit make Conan the best of all talkshow host of this era.
Gotta say, Conan was entertaining throughout the entire show. Always was my favorite late night host
Dudes pain tolerance is NEXT level
Conan is the best. There will never be another.
conan obrien is like the good version of donald trump
Great episode; I'm a Coco fan. Genuine Question: how many season finales is in this season??
I didn't notice till now conans eyes are asian.
Absolutely Brilliant. Sean, Conan... masters of their trade!
Naahhh I was so worried he would rub the sauce into his eyes 😂 the best hot ones!!
I can’t be the only one that keeps coming back to rewatch this masterpiece of comedy!!!
There aren't many men that make me laugh but Conan makes me laugh out loud aka LOL. smile. Love HIM.
We need Henry Cavill for this show
The chickenwings in his pocket bro this guy😂😂
At around 19:00, the Conan's speech just makes me feel goosebump. Imagine how fantastic it would be if the Conan O'Brien's figure turns into the final boss of a videogame, or a show.
absolute legend
Guest gives a nice compliment to the questions from Sean and the writing team  Hot ones comment section: Sean Evans is a JOURNALISM WAR HERO and INFORMATION GOD and EVERYONE MUST AGREE that his polished head is PERFECT FOREVER PLEASE SOMEONE LOVE ME
Omfg! I love Conan! But that was really scary😳😬😱 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵
Conan pocketing the hotwings is a smart move so the police can’t test his DNA.
Best winging interview
100 years, CONAN O'BRIEN ADVENTURES
Bro Conan , one up ⬆️
I'm just sad that I don't feel this much passion about work! Why?
LEGEND!
Conan is crazy and hilarious.
oh no did conan elect himself as the spice lord of the lords
The opposite of Khaled.
this episode is truly special. i love seeing conan pop up in other stuff more.
This was iconic!
I love this guy!
The first bit with the Dr, I'm already in stitches. Best HotOnes episodes ever. There can be only be one Conan
I wish i was one of those wings going into Conan's jacket 😒
Bring. On. Flula. NOW.
I've been watching hot one's for years and never witnessed Shaun react with such fear and surprise
legend
I’m team coco all day I always felt he was a serious host but when it was funny it was FUNNY and for him to say hey your a great interviewer !! That’s amazing coming from connan he really was an interviewer not a host hosting came with the interviewing part!
“To quote my hero, Popeye, I yam what I yam” 😂
People here thinking wings in the pocket is a bit when actually it's Conan making sure his DNA doesn't get into the wrong hands and the Irish couldn't make a clone army of Conans.
This is it, this is the greatest episode.
Happy Belated Birthday Conan!
Man This guy is a gem, hats off to the king of spicy wings Conan O'Brien.
I feel Conan would play an incredible villain in a movie
i can't count how many times i rewatched this episode. Conan is the man!
Someone spent the entire next day in the smallest room...
conan too tough for this show
Best episode I've seen
what a maniac...im here for this every day 👏 🙌....get matty matheson on next season please
he never saw a spice until he was 52 years old ROFL
The living legend of comedy
Best episode yet! Conan killed it
I LOVE THIS!!!!!!! 😂😂😂❤🎉
😂😂😂❤🎉
SEAN PLEASE PLEASE GET JEREMY ALLEN WHITE ON HERE !!!
Call the wife
i bet Conan had anaesthesia on his tongue.
this was goated
The REAL and STILL reigning KING of Modern Late Night. They might have taken his thrown on NBC, but he's still the King of Late Night.
Waiting to hear how he Jennifer Lawrence'd later that day at home.
Legends
I love Conan and he did an awesome job.  But he could have eaten a few miracle berry tablets beforehand. It won’t totally take all the heat away but it will dramatically help.  He will still pay for it later. I only say that because to drink the super hot would be almost impossible and still be able to talk.
This is craaaazy
Best episode ever lol
Disturbing
Best…episode….ever…..
you must be kidding me with the hot wings. spice give out your blue eyes. what about all the filler talk. very cold hearted. high stakes content. seems like a mi-stake.
Conan got the rubber chicken wings 😂😂😂😂…until the last one.
I think it’s important to recognize how much we all reference it. And he was such an influential person…. And just those final minutes.  “He doesn’t even understand the numbers”  Such a genius joke…..  Thank you Conan
Loved the jay leno shade
I love how Conan devolved into Chris Farley, so reminiscent of some of Chris's best gags on SNL.  And pretty sure Conan covered his tongue in candle wax, that's his secret!
Holy sheet
just watched the show and no wonder he survived the hot ones, he ate thailand streets food
This is the best thing on the internet. What an absolute legend.
BEST. HOT ONES. EPISODE. EVER! 🧡🐥
What a nut case
i do not like this
We're not worthy!
this is so bodly and grotesque
I going to say it and mean it. Conan is the greatest talk show host of all time, even better than Carson. This guy can talk to and hang with anyone and it make it entertaining.
It blows my mind that not one second of Conan ever feels forced or hacky
I LOVE him!!!
who knew Conan O'Brien was this much harder than DJ Khaled
Legend.
I've watched every hot ones and this episode was the absolute best!  Conan IS the barbarian!
As long as I've known about this show, this is my first time watching it because i love Conan and he's right. You are a great interviewer.
Who’s the best? Conan. Bar none. He gives it his all every time. What’s his new show? Who cares? He just killed the show…. Who ever does it after this will never live up. Conan…. You are a barbarian.
at 23:50 and on when he was talking about old comedy.. that came straight from the heart. conan's an awesome dude
I love Conan. Absolute legend and Absolutely under-rated. I love how he doesnt take himself
Definitely the *most* Sean has ever laughed in any interview 😂
That was awful. Toouch for me
This is the best episode!  So I was laughing with tears 😂
call the wife
i love conan so much
“Can I keep these?” Is WILD!!!! 🤣🤣☠️
please get Craig Ferguson if possible. but also Love Conan best guest/host so far.
i wish they showed us conan 30/40 minutes after the show :D poor feller must have felt that one... what an episode lol :D
G.O.A.T
Conan eating ‘Da Bomb…total chicanery, especially with the sweat appearing on his face, and below his nose on his upper lip.
Conan is the best!!!!
Conan's not really my style of comedy, but he seems like a swell guy who cares about the audience and gives his whole self to the performance. Much respect.
That was the best show ever!!!! Conan is a legend!
Epic man Conan ❤ 🔥
For those of you who don't know Conan, you're missing out big time.
Conan hosted himself lets be real
No one is funnier than Conan! I've never seen him with that much color!
I've always loved Conan, I watched him faithfully in my teen years, never failed to make me laugh.
Hes the real Joker
This has to be a cameo to the Simpson's episode when homer waxed his tongue and ate peppers and went insane lol
Conan is the ultimate champion of hot ones
today I learned Conan turns into Colin Mochrie when he eats hot food
That was glorious.
That dude turned into Chris Farley and John Belushi 😆
🤣
man that's so freaking amazing
This is the best episode of this show ever!
This is gpoing to be hard to top. Magic!
Second time watching I laughed harder than the first time.
We need a follow up.  That sauce he drank may have put a hole in his body somewhere.  Epic show😂
Of course Conan would come with a prepared bit.  I love that guy.
😂😂 I cannot with Conan! The best one hands down! ♥️
Why is the music so dramatic?
What is going on 😂
The best episode so far!!! There is only one Conan O'Brien...
Pure Conan at his best!!!
i like your shows and i also bought the sauces to try , but seeing Conan O Brien  drinking this without any heat reaction is hilarious .  greetings from Germany
Conan getting me fired up. I appreciate the extreme levels of LFG.
A guest’s MOST epic disregard for his welfare  ever displayed on the show.  And it worked.
I can't believe he started drinking the hot sauce 😂😂 That was awesome!  I can't believe that he didn't pass out. I won't forget this episode.  Great job Hot Ones!
Sean is kicking his feet thrilling his hair and blushing 🥰
As an equatorial human… ain’t no effin way I could sustain a conversation with that amount of heat!!!! Kudos Conan!!!!!
Conan is a comedy legend
Insane effort all round and I couldn’t stop watching.😂😂😂😂
He is not the best but affordable 😂😂😂
Hahaha, goat episode, how is he alive after all that. xD
Redheads!
Thank you Conan!!
Conan's the GOAT!!!!!! Hit the like!!!!
I need Conan's doctor, He gratuated from 1998,  what more could I ever need
Best episode to date.
Conan is one of the best talk show hosts of all time. He might be the best ever. I'm just waiting for people to comment and tell me why I'm wrong
Conan a 🐐
This is insanely good lol
Best ep yet.
He definitely has the confidence of someone who hasn't overdone it on spicy before.
Legendary i was belly laughing through this whole thing oh how ive missed conan
Conan's hair, for some reason, makes me think of Cameron Diaz in the movie "Something about Mary."
BEST HOT ONES EP EVER! Legend.
Conan O’Brien is the absolute king. God bless this man
I keep rewatching this 😂
What a fucken Beast!
please check my pulse, it's there....
The Funniest MC of a GOAT Late Night Show... CONAN... love him
Conan the GOAT, so glad you got him!
This was the funniest hot ones on record. I love Conan 😆 He’s truly a fool and a scholar.
This is the most hilarious episode ever!!!!!
Oh man I watched Conan my entire childhood.. I was so heartbroken when he stopped doing the tonight show!! It’s amazing that his top tier comedy is still the same ❤❤❤ the way he delivers is always so insane 😂
Get jordan on here next
Freaking legend!!
Legends ,,🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sean didnt even need to be in the room
Thank you if i had the money to cashapp yall i would because this laugh i needed more than life as i was contemplating suicid3 from my boring life lol this spiced it up lol thank yall
I actually cried laughing he's a genius
Is he still alive? 😂
The best one.
😂haha what are we going to read hahaha😂
one of fewest people on earth that can make me burst in laughter. him and louis ck. something about being a redhead makes you strive to be the best... i'm one, i know why. we're like a minority group that's being discriminated against in everyday life, without it being recognized by the authorities, and without any compensation and the ability to wine about it. basically, you're a kind of a freak, with no discounts.
He needs to do a part two!
he is cheating. he should have ate the whole wings and not put it in his pockets..
Never new he was that funny
Best thing i saw in years , hands down
Just wow
The best, by far. 🫡
I want conan to do a episode as host with Rachel Ray and spice King made wings or her way flavored sauce on spoon lol
true legend
Ayi this guy a savage or idk what’s wrong with him
For all of his faults, Conan is a really talented Talk Show host who clearly loves his job. Genuinely a mad lad.
This was the greatest episode of Hot Ones EVERRRRR lol
Scorsese recently said he now realizes the full potential of cinema, but it’s too late for him.  I think we’re seeing Conan realizing and acting upon the full potential of comedy.  This video is hilarious, but much like Scorsese and other masters, just witnessing this man do what he was put on this earth to do is genuine magic, and I’m happy we all get to witness it.
When do we get MatPat!!!!????
he has to have ate the berry that makes everything sweet, it';s gotta be a bit no way
Make an episode with the Doc! Mf was funny asf
conan makes everything special
That was insane 😂
Conan is one of my favorite comedians
Who's show is this, sure isnt Sean's.
Conan is the best
I thought this was gonna be a boring interview but he was just easing us into it. This became the most unhinged interview ive seen on here
Conan is incredible. Best episode and guest.
Connan was unstoppable here. Has anyone conquered the wings like this man.
In 20 years, Conan will be in his late 70's and those wings will still be in those pockets all folded up and put neatly in a wooden box that ends up on a shelf in a closet for some family member to discover and wonder staring into the wall. Why?
We don't deserve conan hahah he is truely a comedy genius
I was not expecting any of this...
This red headed kid has something…
My goodness, Conan is a freaking legend!
What a legend
I fcking love this guy!...
YOU GUYS MUST GET TOM BRADY ON
As a NYC Security Officer 30yrs.....I met Conan. Once. I was never a fan. However.....he treated me like gold. So very respectful n cordial. He was chillin solo btw.....which made our interaction even more personable. He thanked me....he didn't hav to. I'm a chili head....I LOVE HOT SAUCE N HOTTER PEPPERS. I had no idea Conan was such a trooper 2 the heat. This was the funniest episode of HOT ONES ever!!!
This is the best episode of the hot ones
Ye know I thought I'd find his episode annoying and I was 100% right. Why?! Just why?
By far the best Hot ones yet!  What a guy! What a comedian!
His slobbered bits and pieces mouth got to be too gross to watch. 🤮 Gotta hand it to them, though, for running the course. 💪
This should be the final episode. There’s no place left to go after this sheer madness and perfection 😂👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
He is a true comedian. He should do a stand-up. If he really stuck to it, he would be a great!
literally masterpiece
bravissimo
IS THIS SHOW A BIT TO YOU?!
“Wise words from a wise and stable man” 🤌🏼
I think this the moment where conan has become my favourite person to ever exist
Conan, Thank You
GREATEST HOT ONES OF ALL TIME
FFFFFFFFFFFFF-
CONAN NO WAY YOURE STEEL FACED AFTER ALL THE WINGS
This was a season finale?🥺
21:15 Conan continues to escalate
Ok see you soon
*sees Conan destroy the bomb wing* CONANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN *viking cheering*
Conan, incredible. I teased you all over your Facebook page’s comments (cuz I know that’s probably the best way to have your attention 😂) of how red I wanted to see you get. And seeing you tear down this wings….  All I wanted to do was tickle a nerve but here we see a water buffalo wreak havoc. With the help of a very inexpensive doctor 😂 Well done, Conan. I called that you’d be one of the best hosts of Hot Ones and I was right
Awesome show. Conan is the man
I haven’t laughed until I cried in a long time. I needed that lol
when he said his hip swelled up and he couldnt get his jeans on my first thought was "his jeans do be tight tho"
21:15 god dayum
Conan is the funniest guy ever.

Thats right....Wing drop☺️
I would like to make a longer comment, but i am dieing laughing hysterically.
Real danger dude 🤙✊
Plot twist he didn't grow up on bland food he is just immune to flavour
Conan is a warrier!!!
Bro... Conan is a beast! I think I've never seen Sean so shocked, excited and a little bit scared.
Jimmy Fallon could never!
Absolutely great episode
Conan is truly one of a kind. We are so lucky to have grown up with him. Legend.
lol
This is the greatest guest by far!!
he's the American version of graham Norton, two of the only talk show hosts that let the guest speak.
by far the best episode
Coco is a fokin legend.
Conan has always been a real one.
Call the wife!! 😂
3 minutes in i realized why i stopped watching conan o brien everywhere else lol such a washed up cringe fest
He went crazy 🤪
Conan es the best comedian in the world
An absolute masterpiece.  Thank you Conan and Sean!
I love Conan.
I'm surprised there were no questions regarding his time as one of the early Simpson's writers.
i watch this almost everyday
What a fukin animal
I felt that Conan was just over acting instead of being himself like most of other guests. Not that it was unexpected but not worth watching for me.
legend
The man of steel. Good God, Conan charged through those wings! Amazing!
This was so good. Thank you Sean
GOAT
I'm gonna be honest.. Conan seemed a little tepid here
Lol, shots fired... Letterman and that other guy
Could have been better if they said they had a special message for Conan from a celebrity fan and played Mac and Me.
8.6 million views after 2 weeks is criminally underrated
He is going to need a doctor.
Season 23 ? What is it 3 season's a year ? Lol
Sean Evans. The Charlie Rose of food interview shows.
Stop with all these accurate and brilliant comments with which I couldn’t agree more.   I can’t like all your comments!!!
Conan is honestly one of my favorite people ever. When he and Joel McHale get together I just die laughing.
Satan came ready🤣😭😂😂😭🤣jk
Best One Yet! Wish you ask about that amazing IQ
best episode
Took the sauces pretty good for a white guy 😂😂😂
Favorite comedian of all time, favorite guest of all time, favorite artist of all time
That was great
I stayed up to watch Conan...I suffered through leno
"My INTESTINES have turned into ACID! But I can still remember the PLUG!" 😂😂😂 best hot ones ever
Nobody makes me laugh like Conan O’Brien. Dude’s still got it 😂
This is the first time I've seen Sean speechless and lose control of the show.
Conan is a legend
Shout-out to the understated humor of Dr Arroyo!
Ok so I was super pleasantly surprised by this episode 😂
. . . best episode so far.
Once he drank the hot sauce like it was a drink, he reminded me of the Joker😂
“Im fine. Im perfectly f$cking fine” 🤣🤣🤣
Conan O’Brien is a legend. Best late night talk show host of all time!
Without looking at him, he sounds like Chris Hanson 😂
8.6 million views in just two weeks, perfectly timed right before promoting his own travel show on Max. Pure genius timing! Love Conan, and Sean consistently nails it
This was by far the best episode hahaha Conan is an absolute legend and a national treasure!
conan is a pro
That’s why Conan is the best in the business.
I love Conan so much.
you knoiw he sufferd badly when he shoved that ice cubes in
He looks straight up rabid at the end. LOL
Awesome video man 😎
Masterpiece!
Oh my dear, I hope he's okay. Please don't die Conan.
They should invite Jordan Schlansky to the show.
Conan has gotten a lot of attention for this appearance and rightly so, but I just want to take a moment to acknowledge Dr. Arroyo's contribution - he was a hoot and a funny addition every time he appeared. He's also very inexpensive.
Best ever.
legend
This is the best episode you've done!
This is unhinged. Legendary
A man who isn't afraid to look ridiculous doing something he loves is a man who has conquered the world.
A true pyscho... but I have to respect it Insanely impressive
We need the extended/unedited version of this episode. This is pure gold.
I LOVE Conan !!
Conan O'Brien is definitely the GOAT of late-night talk shows.  He is quite possibly the best to ever do it in the field of television comedy.
wow thanks guys that was fun 😂
100% the greatest episode of Hot Ones. Time will tell if this is the greatest interview of all time
Bro he's dead inside. He needs to talk to a therapist
Ok.  This is the first HOT WINGS I've watched( for years) where I've screamed out in laughter. And I'm at work.  Lol. Conan is such a treasure.
What did I just see?! Conan is a pro and a master content creator, I was rofling.
This is why Conan is my fav
Jesus Christ how is he still alive after that
This is the definition of what Hot One's guests should be! 👏👏
PLEASE INVITE MATTHEW LILLARD❤❤❤
IT'S STUCK AT 8.5M VIEWS BRUH WHAT HAPPENED? I THOUGHT THIS VIDEO SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST 50M VIEWS BY NOW.
Conan is my all time favorite. When in NYC, I’ve gone to see the show many times, once after his “raawwr” to pretty girls, that he did to my gf at the time, he went to shake her hand. I knocked her hand away and shook his. I had to. He is the best
Supposedly, xanax actually stops hot food from being hot. Or as hot. I looked it up awhile back.
Why did he keep putting them in his pocket????😂😂😂😂
best Hot Ones episode ever
I loved Conan in Christmas story
Having a fantastic answer to the "mediocre president" question, while his whole face is on fire, shows incredible fortitude.
We’re with you with the “hbo max,  max “ thing🤣
Ilove Connan
CONAN IS A LEGEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Without exaggeration, this is the funniest thing Ive seen this year
Conan was by the far the best hot ones guest to date. Just absolutely hilarious and chaotic, I couldn't stop laughing man 😂
You can tell he liked the chance to be the interviewee and free reign to go off the rails
He stole Bill Burr's jacket and stuffed wings in the pockets 🤣🤣🤣
This is so digusting and funny.
"he doesn't understand how the numbers work"  I'm dead. Greatest entertainment hands down!  Thank you
This is now my favorite episode
in which the most legendary host becomes a legendary guest. bravo Conan!
Conan is an absolute legend. He stole the show completely.
The best. Enough said.
"Out of state" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’ve always LOVED Conan. He already had me dying with his Dr. Arroyo bit in the beginning
I wonder if Conan is traveling back to hati after barbecue took over.
Conan, focus!
This is by far, my favorite Hot Ones episode!!!  I laughed until my cheeks hurt. 🤣
I've never laughed so hard - this episode was legendary!  Conan all-time best guest!
I thought Conan killed the wings, then I saw Ludacris. 🤯🤯🤯
Conan fell into a cauldron of dabomb when he was a kid.
Conan was hilarious. I thought it was going to be tacky like talkshows are. I was so wrong. Conan had me laughing by myself. I enjoyed this whole episode and just like the wings getting spicy it just got funnier and funnier the longer the show progressed.
Best episode to date. An old school professional
I’m not a doctor but I should be
This just makes me think of Ramsay and what a weakling he is compared to Conan 🤣🤣
The pure Irish energy pouring out of this man’s soul and pores is a sight to behold. Could you even imagine. This is what the British had to contend with. I think dealing with this is what drove the British to colonize the world. They had to escape!!
best one ever :D
What an end to a season this was incredible
Conan is def a BEAST !!! What a SHOWMAN  :D haha
Just like the example of Conan getting on the water buffalo, he just went & did it 110% on hot ones
What is with this background music?
This guy is unbeatable.
Conan’s a beast
You cant stop me from being who i am...
Legitimately impressed with his heat tolerance. Or atleast his ability to act like it’s not hot.
I'm just waiting for the potato judge to show up and say Guilty! ... of being awsome!!! 😂
He goes down in history as the craziest and funniest guest to ever appear on Hot Ones. Good luck to whoever has to close out the next season :P
send him to vacation in Haiti  i heard the Barbecue there is fire
Conan is the GOAT.
I get it now, this show have two categories of guest: Conan and the rest! And it's not even close!!
what an interesting dichotomy of Conan's lunacy, and Sean giving absolutely nothing   no push/pull, no feeding into it, no banter at all, just awkwardly laughing and the whiplash of cutting straight to a super serious prewritten question
The greatest hot ones episode I have ever seen
There’s something poetic about him early on telling the story about how he got on the water buffalo as part of a bit, then in this video doing a bit that leads to him chugging Da Bomb straight from the tube.
That was the best episode I have seen in all your shows. Bravo Conan and Sean
I thought the one with Paul Rudd was the best episode. Conan annihilates it.
This is the MOST FU@KING insane episode EVER!
epic!
i swear if Cokekain is did not exist. Hot sauce will do just fine
Bruh 😂😂😂😂 @21:10
bOss.
Sean failed to meet him!
Was really helping he would do a callback as the spice ramped up, in which he turns to the audience and says, "This isnt going well"
I’m a fan of Conan now
I think Dr Arroyo went to the DeVry university of medicine
this is what it’s like administering pain meds to redheads and also how redheads respond to non-redhead doses of anesthesia mid-surgery 😂
This has to be the BEST hot ones I have ever watched.  Conan is so funny and amazingly daring to be doing what he did and keep a straight face about it all.
I just learned capsaiicin is like bath salts to gingers.
23:44 WHAT A SCREENSHOT hahaha
I have never laughed so fkn hard in my life cheers to the both of you
i’ve watched Conan since 2018 man. i’m a big fan fr
Where did you graduate medical school? 1998 😂
Who is the comedian playing Conan’s doctor? He was great as the character, his comedic timing and improvisation! EDIT: We’ll duh that makes sense. His name actually is Arroyo. Jose Arroyo and he is one of Conan’s writers!
So unbelievably hilarious, just constant laughter 🤣
😂 Stethoscope to the tongue got me.  Conan rubbing sauce on face a nips too. Started noticing his face getting as red as his hair...😅  His right eye started twitching at the end. With the hair curl shaking I lost it...
best Hot Ones since the start. What a showman Conan O'Brien!
He was a Viking, he feasted :))
Tucker Carlson??
"Call the Wife!" 🤣🤣 AAhhh, King Conan, thank you for edutaining us all! And being just delicious the whole way through. And I'm glad you didn't rub your eyes.
No one , literally no one will top this.  Pepper X 2.0 pepper 🌶️, maybe??
Fan of Conan forever since the beginning 😂❤
Happy belated Birthday @Conan🥳🎂🍾💃💯
Crying!!!!! Hahaha
Best hot ones guest, hands down.
This is the best interview in this series history and it belongs to the man Conan O'Brien
I like spice; just tried Dabomb and it’s eye-watering hot. Even smelling it is an experience. Disbelief when Conan slathered then destroyed it and two hotter ones  Just insane commitment and utterly hilarious!
I love Conan for this.
This ends similar to the pilot of Rick and Morty
Please do not feed Conan's hot sauce again, it messes with his medications! 🤣
I love you conan
Pure gold... What a great episode! 🤣
TX Travels, what are you doing here?
jesus conan crushed this
one of the best , he definitely embarked the spirit of the sauce 👌.
17:28 his water becomes milk… confirms Conan is Jesus
That was soooo awesome!!!! He came visit us in the carrier when we were in Iraq back in the days…had a picture with him and Triumph!
WHAT. A. KING.
Absolute legend
Conan is a legend 💪🏻 definitely gotta check out the new show. I remember watching his show doing homework back in high school 😂
Sean called Conan a Wise and Stable man at 24:40 when Conan looked like that lol …I couldn’t agree more w/ him
Conan O'Brien, and Dave Grohl, the only people to ever take over the show and becomes the host. Both are some of the greatest things ive ever seen, ever.
Conan wins the greasy, pimento milk stained crown of chicken based entertainment and therefore, of everything.
"The water buffalo and i made amends, we're good now" GOOD you dont want one of those things hunting you for the rest of your life.
This is the best episode of Hot Ones ever made. Informative, entertaining, humorous, engaging, spicy... it's everything that was ever needed.
I love you Conan..dam ive missed your rants
best episode....hands down
Last Dab of Legends!  ( _and First Dab, and Second Dab, and Third Dab, 4th, 5th, etc., etc..._ ) 🥛🥛 🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗
This man's energy is insane. 😂
big bro went full rick sanchez at the end, loved it
That seriously was the best thing I’ve ever seen.
Has anyone checked on Conan this week? Is he still with us? I’m worried the sauce ate through him.
It doesn’t get any better. Conan has reached king status…crown him.
Conan, Ledgend, dude be buggin. Lol😂
“CALL THE WIFE!!!” 😂
Conan the man. 😂
Hearing Conan O’Brien being unhinged and swearing is what I needed in my life
This is the funniest hot ones episode hands down 😂
It's a Conan show, Hot Conans
Much love for Conan ❤
Hands down my favorite episode. Conan was so over the top in the best way. Original and a MACHINE!
That’s my birthday also
He still has his whippy dip hairdo and still funny.🤣
Conan!!❤😂
Conan is a Batman villain here
Conan's lips by the end😂😂😂
is this guy afraid of clones?
Conan setting the bar for all future Hot Ones episodes.
20:40 “mistake” someone off camera “yep.” HAHAHAHAH
best episode ever
I love Conan O'Brien. Waiting a long time to see him on this show. I can't be leave he started to drink the last dab lol
Yes, this is definitely the best episode I've seen. Love Conan! Love hot sauce all over his face!
😂 Yay Boo!
Loved the animation!
This episode really made me aware that Conan would be a great voice actor. I’m sure he’s had a role before, but not sure what they are
He's a genius!
Okay, I don't even like Conan, but he was easily one of the most composed guests I've ever seen. If he hadn't been playing it up for the camera near the end, I think he would have been fine. He wasn't even sweating...despite rubbing the sauce all over his face. Completely put together, even able to do a full, articulate promo for the show. Wild. Shockingly professional.
Conan, you are da drooling bomb of insanity. Best ever?
❤
One of the best and yes disturbing yet. The King is Dead. Long live The King 😂
It would have been legendary if Sean said to him while completely unhinged "oh this is not going well."
OK. I've been watching this channel for years now. I love his enthusiasm and thoughtfulness in interviewing these somewhat larger than life people. I had to pause at the opening of DaBomb. I'm writing now, Roll a smoke get a drink and buckle in for for ride ahead. This could be Conan the Barbarian 😂 Go on my son 😂😂😂
There are few egomanias I tolerate and enjoy watching. Zlatan Ibrahimovic and this guy are ones of those.
I'm only here for Da Bomb... 🤣
Easily best episode of Hot Ones ever!! Conan is King of wings. Hardest I've ever laughed watching this show, what a legend.
What a beast he is! You could tell he was in pain he just didn't give a 💩😁👍👍🙌
So good.
Cream of the crop!
Give us Flula Borg!!!
The sheer mastery of two hosts who represent the old school and new school. Sean’s skill at letting Conan loose enough then bringing him back in and Conan’s mastery of almost going to far then leaning in to articulate his wisdoms. This was a f*!king great show.
😂
The goat bro.
Love you CONAN!!!!
My stomach hurts from laughing, this is gold!
This man is crazy. Great show i laughed the entire time.
Conan O-Brien is a straight up LEGEND!
Cool that he is using the same jacket in the photo when he talks about the podcast and this same interview
Jesus Christ.  Conan is unquestionably the GOAT
what was that about Bee Athour dying in 4 years, we will miss you Conan
Conan has been all over the world and eaten some of the most spicy dishes everywhere. Not shocked he handled this so well
Conan has won me over. So funny and smart. His appearance with Jimmy Fallon recently is legendary. He was basically the best funniest guest. He did a great job. His Max show is hilarious. Hes just funny.
Conan is the greatest
Benson at wing kingdom...
Conan played it cooler than Dave Grohl!!
this was the best hot ones episode honestly. coco is the best man.
Conan was honestly my favourite talk show host. I never knew he had a podcast😅
He can be related to Tom Green lol
What an episode 😂
Oh I love Conan! I watched him every single night when he was on late night. Then when he left, I never watched another late night show again. Thanks for the laughs, Conan!
As I wipe my laugh-tears from my eyes I have to ask how Sean was able to even ask questions intelligently especially the last third of the show. Haven't laughed this hard in a very long time.
This might be the best anyone got through the hotness
the DA BOMB hot sauce almost put my uncle in the hospital no joke he ate some and it was so spicy he could barely breathe it wasnt even a allergic reaction
What a legend ❤
26:03 wouldn't having a hot sauce stain from conan o'brien on his jacket make it more valuable??
Max is still an amazing foil for Conan thirty something years later.
Best episode ever 😂.
I've seen a lot of these and Conan is by far the best guest ever.  What an amazing human being.
20:40 So that is where he got that little vocal quirk from. I always thought it was a Far Side cartoon.
This deserves to be at the absolute top of the hall of fame
Best episode. Won't be beaten.
"CALL THE WIFE!!!" 🤣🤣🤣
Oh man, love your show... This was the best one yet! 💀
Worst bit bout chilli sauce, is not taking it,,, its excreting it
One of the best shows ever!  Great compliment from Conan to Sean.
3 Questions: 1- when did they stop putting the Hot sauce on, 2-when did the host stop eating at the same time,3-how is Conan video is doing better than Shakira's video!! But i kinda get it a little bit his funnier his in his element.
My favorite host, been doin it for so many years. So funny yet so professional and Conan gets to meet him, what an honor!
Who knew Conan would be the new JOHNNY KNOXVILLE!!!
THE GREATEST HOT ONES EVER!!!!!!!!!
i love conan so much
You’re not a doctor are you? I should be 😂😂😂😂
is this the grand finale of this show
Nice sub
God I wish Karl Pilkington came onto this after An Idiot Abroad.
Is it just me, or Conan just took control of the show?
*milk pouring out of his mouth* "I HAVE A SHOW"
And that's why he's the GOAT!
WHAT A CHAD
Now I'm convinced Conan is a demigod
Conan- " Call the wife!!!! " 😂
GAWD WHAT A LEGEND!!!!
His sauces must be fake ones, this is impossible. No one pro in hot sauce has done this in this show, so it is fake to me
😂 he keeps drinking the hot sauce  🤣
21:05 - You're welcome
Sean, you should've ruined that sweet suede jacket with Conan. It would've become a relic.
The GOAT host .
Conan is the man!!
yo finally someone not wasting the chicken. respect brother
What a legend
WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ok  .... That might be too much. OR IS IT??
"Doctor, can you step in? My pockets are getting full" 😂 Conan is one of a kind
I’ve watched this 5 or 6 times
Two of my absolute heroes, masters of their craft in one show. Such a joy! 🥳❤‍🔥
When he brought in his personal doctor, I was already dying 😂. Classic Conan
wings in the pocket is such an unexpected bit lol
Ah, so that's what they meant by 42.
Conan is da B💣mb!
The next time I'm in a pinch, I'll remember Conan at 22:20 and persevere through it
Let's be honest, Murderville prepared him for this😂
Conan's Bathroom is gonna be a bloodbath.
Best Guest EVER!
Easily the greatest hotones episode ever!  Thank you Conan!  I have watched it 4 times!  Thanks for killing your inners for comedy!   You’re the King
He’s got to be one of the funniest comedians on planet earth
I want a Dr. Arroyo (sp?) show after this
Conan licks his fingers and burns for comedy😅
I will be making it a priority to watch Conan’s new show now because I respect the effort 😂
I'VE BEEN WAITING
The fact this episode felt like a full movie, slow start with hints of comedy and complete loss and control, even though he can still formulate his words and thoughts without fumbling. A true performance of not only comedy but being able to understand the stage and presence of the audience and those around him.
This one has everything you ever wanted watching a show. A true masterpiece. Conan delivers. As always.
Conan you are the man!!!!
I have a theory that Conan's hair is an entity and what we know as Conan is just a large tumor that has been thriving for decades.
Gawd dayuum. Conan said, 'Are you even trying?' lol
What a genius lunatic! Hahahaha
16:53 Grandma just went rabid
4 episodes wasnt enough lol
Dr. Nick had to have been his idea way back in the early 90s.
Best episode ever
This is one of the funniest episodes I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂
I would love to meet and hang out with Conan for a day. I bet I wouldn’t stop laughing and smiling 😊. Thank you 🙏
The only true late night show host left who is genuinely charismatic.
I now get Conan. Bravo
Man I just realized we probably will NEVER get someone as funny as Conan and as charming as Conan as a talk show host. He truly is one of a kind and I am thankful I was alive during his time as a talk show host
Conan is an absolute treasure!
"Call the wife!" Had me dead 😂
He just shows the difference b/n professional entertainer vs youtuber
Great episode
Craig Ferguson please 🙏🏽
I didn't know Conan had a freckle on his lip.
THE BEST THERE IS
I tried cottage cheese to help smooth the heat from hot sauces. Has anyone tried that? It worked better than ice cream or milk. If not, someone please see if it works for you too.
I did watch most of the first episode of Must Go (so far just tonight) and it made me "guffaw" as the youth slang goes
Dude took over the whole show since 00:00 😂
I'd like Conan to video record his toilet experience after that
This is EASILY the highlight episode of the entire program. This tops EVERYTHING.
This is superb.
14:01......MADMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Top 5 interviews for me!  Well done!
Wing drop 🍗🎤
"Whats wrong with me why cant i Feel!?" 😂😂 I'm done
Conan is a legend. 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the greatest - and more importantly honest showman in history. Love you Conan. Never stop. Until your dead maybe, not a bad time to stop there.
Conan is gold
Ugh, the music in the background 😒🙄😒🙄
16:52 When you know done messed up, but there's no turning back now - embrace it!
Conan is the freaking best
Conan is the GOAT, the conan must go show is hilarious
it is Hack😂😂😂😂
“Now this is a funny video.” — Charlie 🎉
Conan is the Best!!!
Best one yet😂😂
Conan is a legend This is the best hot ones I've ever watched
This man is insane 😅
As Conan said, "There's comedy everywhere," and he proved he could take comedy everywhere 😂😂😂😂 he made me laugh so much my husband had to check on me😂😂😂😂😂
Legend!
This show is so good, love seeing all the guests... but this was my favorite ever. Hands down.😂
This is the best episode
Conan is a badass.
"What's wrong with me, why can't I FEEEL!"  😂😂  This episode proves Conan is completely dead inside 😂
Half expected him to take a wing out of his pocket and wing drop at the end there...

You have almost 14 million subscribers. You can get massive celebrities. You can afford someone to do subtitles.

Complete savage
"it's up two degrees from when he started the show, no lie" Perfect finish by doctor Arroyo.
Masterpiece. Haven’t laughed this hard in a long time.
who is the other guy? 6:29
Conan is a beast
Conan is too good, keeping the left over wings in his pocket, he's so ridiculous
It's really a shame Conan left and allowed that TDS political hack Jimmie Kibble to take over.... I know Conan isn't a "fan" of Big Donny T in that proverbial seat, but at least he wasn't deranged nor did he ever really baselessly attack him like Kibble and the other morons do....he just did his job and was actually funny.
I love this guy-
This one was the best episode of all time 😂🌮😂🌮😂
Conan is a barbarian, seriously.
What an absolute LEGEND he is!! He just did it in a way we've never seen before, Conan is a true showman if there is one!
Absolutely amazing. Never would have guessed Conan would have slayed this. Impressive ❤
DJ Khaled loses. Conan wins.
Wow.  This is a great moment     I'm actually crying cause this is perfection. Thank you Conan
incredible
8 million ❤
Conan is a legend.
"The other guy". Love how Conan won't even mention Leno's name.
Who would’ve thought one of the greatest shows in modern days would come from the hot ones
The pulse checking joke had me crying... 😂
Job well done. Loved how much time was given to Conan to respond. Legends.
Conan is a friggin froot loop holy cow
This felt like the final boss chapter. Best.Episode.Ever.
May be the best episode ever!

Oh, God. I'm dying of laughter. 🤣

BRING CASEOH TO THE HOT ONES
There is an excellent analysis about Conan, really showing that he is one of the best hosts, but as a guest he puts on the persona of a terrible guest
Conan will always be one of the goats.
Bossssssssssss #1
This might be the best one yet lolololll
Shame that Conan didn't have his Haiti shirt on. Oh well, maybe he didn't want to get any "Barbecue" sauce on it.
Best episode ever
Just wow! The King of Late Night!!!
Please tell me Conan is fine😮😮😮😮
Conan please do more history stuff!
Best guest 😂😂😂😂
Leave it to Conan O'Brien to push through the confines of a platform, drawing the attentions and love and awe of the masses to define a truth that the bit is life!  Best FWFHO interview EVER!!!!
I’m from the UK and have heard of Conan O’Brien but have never really seen him before. This was the best hot ones episode hands down, fella’s fully unhinged but also has fantastic kind ‘dad’ energy and I’m here for it.
What a mess
His insistence that there was no bit when the entire thing was so very very clearly a giant bit was phenomenal.
Best ever. Awesome. Both of you, awesome.
I was not expecting that. Conan is in a class by himself
Now I see why J.G. Quintel used Spicy wings as an analogy for drinking alcohol and getting wasted
very funny.Too bad gingers have no soul.
When he starts drooling and spitting milk I lost it. Had to pause the video to recover.
Maybe my tenth time watching this and still enjoying it as if it is my first time.
The MAN 🎉🎉🎉🎉CONAN😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 LEGEND ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I imagine it is extremely difficult to get Conan to clam down and be candid, go job hot sauce and Sean!
Best ever Hot Ones episode!😂
This should have way more views...
Conan tried too hard to be funny
Best episode ever.
Doctor strangling Conan
This was the BEST!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conan brought more heat than all of the hot sauces combined.
Conan dunked on Coolio.
Conan gives off SpongeBob vibes.
Conan is incredible
Best guest ever. He owned this.
I thought I couldn't love Conan more than I already did. There's no one better at the business called show.
This is amazing
bro how is he so full of energy and he just ran through those wings like it was nothing 👀👀
Conan’s talk show prowess still shines through bright as ever. Conan is the last of a dying breed of comedian that commits to the bit and will do anything as long it makes people laugh and smile. The man is an absolute treasure.
wings in the pocket 🤣
Best interview ever! 😂😂 He’s amazing 🤩
Conan is even funnier when non-scripted, something that applies to no other (ex-) talk show host. Except maybe Craig Ferguson.
MY GOD THIS WAS AMAZING🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This will be the top viewed episode soon.
I don't fear your wings man.
I love the foreshadowing with the water buffalo story 😅
The Best, Ever❤
The Scoville meter should have Conan's face. From fresh looking to a teary, sweaty face.
Love him ❤
the best episode ever. never doubted it would be.
The cut to Conan with tears and sauce all over his face and him saying “I’m fine!” Just killed me.
what a legend 😂
Oh God, I lost it at 23:00 😂😆😁😭
The waterbuffalo story though 😂
I love Conan 😂 greatest guest of all time!
that went too fast
Wow, officially my favorite Hot Ones.

Conan is a GIANT of television and entertainment.  no Really, that mothrfcka is HUGE, look at him standing next to sean 😮😮
I miss the show
6:24 that was a jab at leno 🤣
Best ep ever!! Conan is the TRUE KING!! ALL HAIL CONAN!!!
PLEASE GET MIKE WATT ON YOUR SHOW!!!!!
this was so good
sean is literally dying on the other side and conan is doing COMEDY!!! absolute legend!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The greatest episode I’ve ever seen
🙏!!! Please do Jordan Schlansky !!! 🙏
this is THE best episode of Hot ones I think.
That was the most amazing show yet, insane but amazing.
This has to be the funniest episode so far xD
I like Conan but honestly, he’s not funny. He’s very awkward and that can be funny but if he was a normal guy doing the things he does someone would have him or believe he should be committed…
old man tries to be funny by shouting
He's losing his mind! And I'm reaping all the benefits...
This is so nice insight about Conan, and he can be so captivating. He's trully a showman. And you Sean, he is right, you always keep your attitude to the series and it's amazing.
Cool. But I threw up when he ate like a raccoon
Okay.. did anyone else not know how tall Conan is??
Massive respect to the og
I would love to know how Conan dealt with the aftermath of that 😂😂
No one is gonna be able to top Conan. Best one ever
Growing up watching him throughout all these years, never fell short comedically paired with such intellect. He has never once failed to make me laugh. Conan will always be to me: The Peoples Host  Team Coco forever <3
Ayyyooo  he on somthin😂
oh my god, it was beautiful, no one can make me smile like conan does
A masterclass in comedy.
I’ve never felt more admiration & yet a little disgusted there towards the end. ❤😂
Best episode ever!!!
This makes me wish we could see Robin Williams on Hot Ones
Greatest episode ever
O brian a beast.  Hotwinhs shoukd bring Machete in
This was one of the best episodes ever on hot ones! I thought I’d seen it all you my guy are absolutely insane. I love it!
Conan may be a terminator, just saying
There's something very David Lynch about this. Hmm... David Lynch... Hot Ones....?
I'd love to see Jim Carrey
that was absolutely insane. Conan is a legend.
im so late conan is too white and red for this 😂😂😂😂
Conan is way over the top and so extra but he’s the only one in my book that can do it so naturally and is actually funny and non cringey. Bro must be protected at all costs.
And that's why Conan is a goat
The best to do it. Back when late night wasn't filled with canned laughter and political propoganda.
23:17 That whole speech should be required viewing at every comedy school. Be well read. Have deep references. If you only scratch what's hot or what everyone else does, you won't be different, or exciting.  Those are surprisingly wise words you don't normally see during the final dab!
you on your off days should do random youtuber interviews... i thinks thats the next level
I cried laughing - wept tears for the Conan
Conan is a beast
Another Max telling Conan what's up
This is the best episode of all time 😂😂😂
Hilarious!
I like Conan, He definable makes show fun for the normal audience.
Oh god. I havent laughed that hard in YEARS!!!!
Absolutely everything Conan does is legendary! ❤️😂😂😂❤️ 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Conan is badass 💪 let's go!!! 🤣🤣🤣 Amazing!!!
He looks f**king great for 62 😮
One of the best on this show !!!!!!
Great
Conan is the man!
Nothin like seeing a wild Coney out causing mischief!
Next to the women sweating, this, was an amazing interview.  Conan must have crapped fire for an hour.
Is there a chance those were fake bottles of sauce
The editing was amazing... The show was amazing.. a thumbs up from me.. 😂🤣
Now I wish I could see Steve Martin be interviewed and other classic comedians.
The last ten minutes is like to watch a horror movie! 10/10
The stethoscope to the tongue. The wings in the pocket. Conan gave the best episode to date!
It's cool how he just went for it. Most talk show hosts are apprehensive. But to be fair, Conan seemed very desperate to pick his show back up towards the end.
Conan is the BEST. smart, witty and on point for ANY situation.
Encore, ENCORE!!!
love Conan!!!
Jesus 😂😂😂😂😂
Conan completely mogged those wings.
22:57
Conan iz beyond hilariouz😹❤❤😹
Best hot ones of all time
I would not have expected this Irish man to be able to tolerate it so well. I'm incredibly impressed.
Somewhere in there the ghost of Chris Farley entered his body and never let go.
True showman 👏
😂😂😂 I laughed non stop, Conan is comedy gold
TERRENCE HOWARD PLEASE
I think the same person that used to style Imelda May's hair styles Conans'
And he wouldn't go in a sauna in Finland!
LMFOAOOO idk if I'm too high but the bottles suddenly all being knocked over absolutely killed me, like whatd he do in the part that they cut out? 😂
That was literally amazing.
I love conan way more than any other late night talk show host
I wonder if Conan went into his old Simpsons bag of tricks and drank candle wax before showing up.
This is the best episode of all time 😂
Wow!!!  Best episode yet!!!
Conan is one of the last Late Night guys, that I still respect. But he was definitively under the influence here 😅
I didn’t know unhinged Conan sounds exactly like Master Shake
His rant at the end reminds me of Dean Lewis from Accepted. Love it.
Conan is a genius
Was he okay after this cuz... I tried mad dog and took one dab and I couldn't speak and was choking and crying 😅
We see Sean for all of 5 seconds. He introduces the Conan Show, is an offscreen voice, and concludes the Conan Show.  I have never seen a guest legit take over this show and no one else could do it like Conan. 3 running bits. Fun stories. And plugging a show I had no idea he had made and can't wait to watch. Love this.
Best episode ever. Conan is a mad man.
I wish Druski could’ve been on a episode.
best hot ones so far... so funny
Conan, bro, you don't have to make everything a bit... This guest was kinda lame. Sean and crew, incredible job as always!
Full blown WING DROP, nothing compares to this one!!
🤔🥲Hey Sean, invite Conan’s cousin, 🤨🤬😡Denis O’Leary to a future show, 🔥🥵🧯for the Coup D’tat…or De Grace.  🤭😆🙂
🗣️ CALL THE WIFE
This is magnificent !!!!
Pure obliteration. A master at work... a spicy, milky master.
Conan IS the hottest one of them all! 😂🔥🔥🔥
Awe man! Where is Roland Duchesne? He'd be perfect for this.
did bro really just do that?
Best Episode MAN!
conan is a living legend
Conan is god
Bro brought his handler on the show and thought we wouldn't notice. Hollywood 😂
This was the definition of Legendary!
Conan had always been a comedy genius.
This felt more like an episode of Conan than Hot Ones 🤣
Jesus Christ!  I don't think Steve-O got this wild with the sauce.
This might be the best Hot Ones video ever! No way they top this one.
The best hot ones episode I’ve ever seen.
Conan is the GOAT.
LOL Oh my gosh! Conan's crazy having all that spicy sauce! I'd not be able to pass the second bottle
I will forever love Conan O'Brien. He's one of a kind.
Washing his hands in hot sauce has me crying. An absolute animal and a true one of a kind showman.
I swear, I'm so grateful to live during the Age of Conan❤❤❤
Conan is such a fkin badass guy, really humble can’t get enough of him
"I don't fear your wings, man."  Totally adopting this into my lexicon.
I N C R E D I B L E
Conan O’Brien never disappoints! Loved this episode
I can't help but notice that Conan's lack of lips are emphasized by the smeared wing sauce.
Glorious
Just watched the Thailand episode where Conan eats the “spiciest scorpion they have” from a street vendor and suddenly his ability to tank these wings makes a lot more sense 🤣
This would have been complete if Sona was sitting next to Conan with the wings as well..... 😅
I guess I shouldn't be surprised that Conan would have quite possibly the best appearance ever on this show.   There are few people of his level of fame that I think truthfully deserve that status, but there is no denying that Conan has a talent and charm that has earned him the GOAT status.
im gonna puke
I'm literally watching this while being sick, and I feel better!
Hands down the best episode. Conan fully committed. Sean, you and the team just keep knocking it out of the park. Best thing on the internet. Period.
legend
Conan's opening line and i'm laughing already. Miss you Conan.
amazing
CONAN!!! I love you!!!
Conan the Barbarian strikes again 😂😂
Hahahaha did he munch on ice cubes?
Incredible. That man is full of surprises.
I love Conan!🤣(somberly) I love Conan....
What did I just watchhhh 😂😂😂😂😂
Love him!!!! ✌️❣️🥀
The most insanely sane interview so far. Class act!
This is like watching Mike Tyson or Tiger Woods in their prime.
The only way you could ever possibly top this now, is to manage to land a Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman simultaneous episode, where Reynolds shows up in costume.
Conan goofs around but what I like is that he still takes the show seriously and answers questions earnestly.
my god that was a rush hahaha - conan the goat of FWF
Conan looks like a mix of Bryan Cranston and Quentin Taranrino especially during the last wing.
Dr. Arroyo.....the best
yeah I knew this was going to be the big _Hot Ones_ before I saw the amount of viewers it already has just 12 days later.   some personalities have Moments, Conan O'Brien's whole career has been his. much like those wings with that hot sauce, this is a perfect combination. who DOESN'T want to watch Conan O'Brien on _Hot Ones?_ that's the question.
conan too hot for hot ones frfr
For him to cuss twice (once about the water buffalo and once at the end), it really shows his pain. He's the goat!!!
Best. Episode. Ever.
"What's wrong with me, why can't I feel" almost had a hernia from laughing
easily top 3 best hot one episode, conan was great and unique
Best guest
Hahahahaha Hahahaha!! 😅😂 I am dying laughing over here! Absolutely the most hilarious thing I've seen in a while 😂 Conan's face is sooooo red. Hats off to you sirs! ❤️ 🎉
"You can't stop me... from being who I am" he says with the Joker lips
Nobody will ever top Conan drinking the hot sauce
How can one persson be this entertaining?!?! What a Legend!!!
Okay honestly this guy, Conan… I’m a fan. Gonna start his show on HBO… I mean MAX.
At 29 years old, I am now a Conan fan. Great job Conan 👏🏼
Well, this is probably the best episode you've ever had. I was dying for 25 mins straight
He delivered, what a comical God
Conan ate Da Bomb and became Da Bomb 💣
Dear lord the ending on this. What a finale. BRAVO, sir, BRAVO!
One of the funniest people we've seen in a long time
This has got to be the best episode the show has ever had
6:21 Conan still hates Jay Leno.
An incredible tribute to Chris Farley
Why did my sinuses open just watching this.
He will die in character. They dont make comedians like that anymore.
Best show from beginning...
I Love Conan O'brien
So wholesome. Thank you for this one
20:16 The moment that I was expecting as a Costa Rican. That sauce is 🔥. I take with the Costa Rican breakfast called gallo pinto. I use it for every dish.
8.3 million views. Conan is still the GOAT
Conan always kills it
Maybe he's doing well at the start because redheads have a better pain tolerance!
This is the best episode I've ever seen Conan is hilarious, what a legend 🤣🤣 🤣🤣🤣
Conan is larger than life
Favorite episode in a while. Laughed out loud
So that's why the Irish don't like spices. They just don't feel it.
This is the best episode ever
I wish i could have seen Leslie Nielsen on hot ones i bet it would have been funny.
Conan for either the joker or the batman who laughs
Please next season, bring no vegan to the show. They ruin it.
Where is Sonia in all this? She is a great PA
OOWWWW YEAAAHHHH!!! 😂
Amazing episode!
He looks like he's wearin lipstick 💋 lololol
My Man is gettin IT! He will Ascend shortly lol
This is a piece of American history
Should have Conan yelling be the permanent sound played at the end over the First We Feast logo. It’s perfect
The best episode everrrr!!!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is the most entertained thing I watch in years!!!!!! Conan is iconic ❤😊😊😊😊
Legend 🔥
Nice to see such a good and talanted host in this show ... and Conan O'Brien
Am I the only one that found this insufferable? Wow
I love that the only person who came close to matching Conan's acceptance and dedication to the pain of this, is his arch rival; the man who upended every interview they ever did together, Mr. Paul Rudd.
THE.BEST.EPISODE.YET. (maybe) EVER. !!! 🔥🔥🔥
He ended up looking like the joker
Best episode I’ve seen!!
Watching Conan on the school nights will always be a favorite memory as a kid. His skits was the best of Leno and letterman.
My gf broke up with me yet Conan never fails to put a smile on my face, I love you Conan!
He was so funny😂😂
I bet conan has been invited to the diddy parties!. No cap son😂😂
One of the best all time episodes!!! 😂😂
This episode was off the charts. Gotta love Conan man. What a legend
Oh what a great Guest Conan himself
Killed it!! And possibly himself in the process ☠️ lol
That escalated...
"Here we are closing out season 23 with Conan..."  *few days later* "Here we are with Ludacris"
Legend! 100 commitment.   Conan O'Brien with another icon moment.
He killed Me with the three stooges sound 😂😂
When this dropped, this was the hardest I’d laughed in a long time.  I lost a parent a week before seeing this, so I really needed a laugh.  Conan is one of the best to ever do it and Shaun is right up there as far as hosts go.
Expected this to be funny and weird... did not expect it to be the most disgusting interview since Bobby Lee....
My favourite episode !! 😂😂😂
CONAN!
The GOAT!!!
The dude is so unpredictable 😂
Literally, the final boss of talkshows
Best ever delivery of "C'mon man, are we going this or not?"
Wings of death GOAT!
COKE ONES
Best episode yet. Love Sean, love Conan, love Hot Ones.
Fantastic chaos!
God bless The Cone
I laughed the ENTIRE TIME😂😂 thee best so far
This is the best episode. Hands down, Love Conan
I Have commented before about how good of an interviewer Sean really is. I feel vindicated that Conan also recognized this also.
First to ODed on hot sauce?
"What's wrong with me?! Why can't I feel?!" 😂😂
Conan and David Blaine are the two that can take the most heat in this show but in completely opposite manner.
Call the wife! Hahah
Immediately doing a bit with the doctor and then the wing in the coat is amazing. Absolutely hysterical and a straight face through it all
Conman is a barbarian
I wonder how he felt next day?
What a Legend. ...Amazing
This might have been the most epic talk show episode of the 2020s. I don't remember laughing that much watching a talk show since a while back
Couldn't find anywhere else to make a comment about the Max show he just dropped man I hope more people watch it I'm on episode 2 halfway through probably one of the most introspective and funny traveling shows I've seen in a very long time
What a great episode... 😂😂😂😂
This is why Conan is the master. Retire this show, it just peaked!
Doc was great
I lost it at im perfectly fkin fine 😂😂😂😂
Pure Viking energy
This is the best HotOnes show ever!! Conan is and was the #1 late night show ever after Jonny carson!!
Norm Macdonald
Oh my god it's not even Tuesday and it has doubled since Sunday
This by far was the most interesting yet amazing wing challenge of all seasons #1 in my book Conan is legendary
I laughed so hard that my partner got mad at me and left the room. Classic.
i'm gonna watch the show
Conan go tell that to DJ Khaled 😂😂
The best guest ever. I don't care. EVER.
David Blaine wished his magic on this show was this spectacular
So conan is the new host I see
Best episode ever
😂 I’m so confused. This gave me the same feeling of looking at a horrifying car crash but also I was cry laughing throughout the entire video. Conan… you are just fantastic. Props to Sean for humoring the pure chaos.
This is my new all time favorite!
This was a bit everyone….check the consistency on the last dab vs Sean’s.
Conan is a legend!
best reaction ever
Best part of the whole episode was Sean: "If you weren't so braggadocious in the front half I would have stopped you." 💜
The best
Mad respect for powerhousing through for the bit. The regret that night after had to be strong. xD Sean's expression at about 22:55, between the pain he's got to be experiencing plus the fear that Conan is going to die on his stage from a coronary, is just pure terror.
There will never be another host like Conan
Smashed it bruv
Did Conan almost die?
By far, the best one I have seen
No one has even come close to eating that much hot sauce and handled it like a beast. ❤Conan.
this has to be the best episode ever
Grew up on Conan. During 2009 and the depression. Now during these tough days post pandemic.. what a entertainer
Legend.
Holy Torpedo!
Conan is the absolute master of his craft.
Conan is an absolute lunatic
Conan beat the highscore !!!!!
0:49 BURGER SUGAR HOMAGE TRACY MORGAN 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👁👁 BLINK BLINK
How high is he?
god, i love Conan!
It's Conan's show now
whats next?!?! punch out god!!??
connor has covid
Conan is a beast. He's not the greatest interviewer ever, but when it comes to acting like a fool to make people laugh, there is no equivalent.  He's pure awesomeness.
Easily the best episode of this show
It was the best episode.
Conan Talk Show Host: Ultimate Conan Podcaster: Master Conan on Hot Ones: GOD Conan as an Oscar Host: Ultimate Master God
Incredible.
insane way to promote a show. i'm watching.
Thee best episode ever
It's going to hurt more when it comes out...bow to the king!
Conan is a complete and utter idiot that i have entirely adored since his beginnings . One of a kind the big lug
i can't believe i didn't think i liked conan i have never laughed harder at a hot ones video
canon is the devil. you can only do that if you have no soul  left to protect. You would actually do anything just to feel something.
The nips burning
Oh man...its 27 minute vid? I thought i was watching 5 min vid...time fly by when you have the best episode of the year...LOVE U CONAN!
Conan absolutely killed
This is probably the best episode I’ve seen on the show, and it’s definitely the hardest I’ve laughed. Conan’s ability to entertain made the usual Hot Ones structure feel unnecessary! So much fun.
has to be the best episode xD
This is the best episode of hot ones 100%
Conan is amazing. He filled the void Johnny Carson left behind that the other two couldn't come close to in terms of mixing comedy with interviewing in such an entertaining way.
Amazing
Best episode ever...
😅😅😅
Perhaps he is immune like some people are to Tear-Gas.
Yes I started clapping after that speech
I'm the odd man out I guess.  I was annoyed by this interview.  When comedians try so hard to be funny or seen or whatever, it's just sad and not funny at all.
jeeesusss!
What are the odds you book twenty one pilots for their new record
fun fact the doctor has been a writer for conan since 1994
ain't no way this episode will ever be topped conan is UNHINGED
Annoying af
Wow! The BEST episode of Hot Ones EVER! Not even close! Wow Sean, there is no where to go but down from here. How can you possibly top this one?! Conan you are truly a LEGEND!!
Hot ones gotta now have Conan as a host... He owned those wings...
THE BEST EVER!
Conan just won Hot Ones.  Best. Episode. Ever.
putting half-eaten chicken in your pocket is crazy 😂reminds me of when FunnyMarco put fried fish in his blazer 💀
hes good on camera he should be a host
This was arguably the best episode yet! Conan is such a joy to watch.
My new favorite episode wow lol
It’s in the Irish genes to suppress agony, or even smear it over your face….and keep bones in thy pocket.
That entire day and the next day's footage would be funnier. Ring of fire.
Conan is aging gracefully ❤🎉
Best episode ever 😄
He did a wing drop 😂
Conan: "No half measures"
He may act a fool, but he is far from being one.
The fact that Conan wore the same jacket as Bill Burr as a fellow red head and never brought it up is brilliant 👏
Trust me Conan as a super lame 38 yr old you are super relevant!
Where do you go from here?
compare this to the dj khaled episode lol
Respect
Simply incredible. Conan still the goat.
What an absolute legend
I literally watched the whole episode with my mouth wide opened lol.
best episode ever, love Conans dedication !
This is the funniest HotOnes episode ever.
This was such a high energy episode
I've never laughed so hard watching Hot Ones
I like this one.
Welp, you're not topping this one.
BEST HOT ONES EVER
Conan is the definition of HIM! 😎
Idk how he did this - botox to the tongue? Sheesh that was intense, im sweating.
Has anyone done a Wellness Check on Conan?  Has he been seen anywhere outside of a bathroom in the last week?
He took over the show like a king he is. Too good.
Conan really tried to convince people that HAITI was a dream vacation spot.
Wow best episode ever.  I liked Conan before but he has been upgraded for sure.
I never seen O'Brien so unhinged before. Nor ever seen him cuss lol
22:35, the genuine look of concern on his face is killing me
Hate to follow that!
As a foreigner, Conan is one if the best exports US can offer ❤🎉 He’s absolutely incredible!
whats also crazy is the hundreds of thousands possibly millions of views this got on react channels after the fact
He a mad man
Hahaha LEGEND!
Conan does not get enough credit for the lengths he will go to get a reaction. haha!
now that's how you do physical comedy
Conan is the GOAT.
I have a newfound respect for Conan O’Brien!! This episode will be ridiculously hard to beat!!! Conan owned the moment!!!
Anybody else screaming WATCH THE EYES!!!
The best guest ever!
*sips from hot sauce bottle. LOVE him!
"the other guy" 😂
Conan o Brian will forever be my most favorite comedian of all time! He is the goat and no one will ever come close!
Never found Conan funny
NOW THIS IS A FINALE!!!!!!!🎉
Perfect picture of mental health this geeza
Conan’s taste buds died years ago after decades of fruitlessly waiting for something to taste
I see a hate speaker ,islamophobe and i unsub
🤣🤣 😂Whats wrong with me ,why can't i feel! 🔥🔥
Conan is an Irish superhero.
Hahahahah
Sean has me laughing. I’ve never seen him smile so big at the end. Lol
Conan is the G.O.A.T. !!!! Nobody else has done ANYTHING close to this ! CONAN IS THE GOAT !!!
Pretty sure I saw a dude on a surfboard riding his fringe during that interview.
Nardwuar has a lot to live up to when he eventually makes it onto the show!
Jimmy Carr on Hot Ones!
Best episode ever
Lol I love Conan he’s so dramatic
My sense of humor was molded by this man (Conan not Shaun) Jim Carrey and Jack black and I’m an incredible human being for it. So 🤷🏻‍♂️ favorite episode of this yet.
Honestly, this is probably one of my least favorite guests you've ever had. Not even remotely funny, and Conan made a terrible interview.  Good job as always Sean you're an amazing host, but even you couldn't save this awful train wreck
Incredible show. Incredible entertainer. And amidst the chaos still found a way to be truly insightful.  Thank you, Conan! - Someone half your age.
I never thought I'd ever hear, Not the best but affordable doctor...💀💀
this was so funny I couldn't laugh haha I LOVE Conan.
There is no way he ate the real sauces.
This is hands down one of the best things I've ever seen.
What an animal. He did what no one else has done and will never be done again. He put himself through that, just so we could laugh. How do you top that? Pour it in your eyes? Snort a line of da-bomb?
I don't think anyone can top this. Best episode ever!
Did Conan confess to un-aliving Bea Arthur?
This has to be the best episodes on YOUTUBE in history.
Conan is a treasure who needs to be protected at all costs!
Man, he could've actually died.
This is just pure genius! ❤❤❤
I'm still laughing maniacally. Conan wrecks me on this! He held up pretty well until he didn't. Food & sauce all over his face! Friggin tears in my eyes!
*Charlie Rose show with hot wings
That was memorable
Best episode EVER.
If not THE best this is one of the best episodes ever.
new joker movie looks good
What a show. Easily the best episode
WOW!!  A TRUE LEGEND❤
I wonder if he has any more spicy takes about Haiti.
He must have practiced for months to build that tolerance
Conan repulsive
Hats off to you Conan The Terminator O'Brien.. jesus
What insanity!!
It’s giving Rick and Morty vibes
Hahahahahahahaha😂😂😂
Dr Arroyo comes in... This is going to be legendary indeed!
Is the show in Texas now?
CONAN I LOVE U 😂😂
The best guest by far!
Lol your not even a doctor  no i should be 😂😂😂
WHAT. A. PRO. 🎉
Speaking of jackets, I would have loved it if Shaun donned a red jacket as a tribute to the Monorail episode.
Move over Gordon Ramsay and Shaq You just been dethroned😅
Best guest ever
What an exhausting human being Conan is.
Is he on drugs?
Somehow he managed to top all other hot ones by far
I am worried of Conan.......'s toilet bowl
Best guest ever on this show!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂
The show seems like how the US would make an idiot abroad
Conan has gotten a lot funnier over the years.
It's Conan love this guy! "His" favourite guy
i was laughing so hard during this- harder than i have in years and it was next to my best friend too - this was epic i love you Conan!
Finally a celeb who goes all in on the joke :D All covered in snot, saliva and chicken sauce. Definitely the best episode so far.
Conan the GOAT! Best Hot Ones episode for sure.
conan is just an absolutely joy to watch on anything
Conan could play Vault Boy.
Conan is the man!!!!
Legends!
The only episodes that I watch till the end without skip and moving forward😂😂😂
This is honestly the peak of hot one’s. how can another guest ever top this? 😂😂😂
I mean he's the man and one of the most amazing guests but near the end I found it hard to watch the things dripping from his mouth and him just a crazed steaming mess.
"These aren't the rantings of someone who's had some bad chemicals, and overdid it to be funny and relevant to people who are at least 50 years younger than him." -Conan O'brien 2024.
Conon O'Brien never disappoints.
By the end of it he looks like a toddler after dinner but instead of chocolate he ate spicy
the little Jurassic park refrain, when he skulled the last sauce, was fkn comedy gold
This is epic!
Hahahah this is the best hot ones I've ever seen
"Im fine" as the world burns around him 😂 he became the dog meme 😂
I remember reading that redheads can deal with more pain and I believe it now
Best. Episode. Of. All. Time.
I share the same birthday with Conan O’Brien 💀
Gross man,got old fast.
i've been watching HOT ONES since pandemic,   but Conan O'Brien episode shed me a tear laughing especially the last sauce
How I love Conan 😂
Something’s searioisly wrong with this man 😂
holy, Conan's head.. the red saturation. i thought something was wrong with my screen. haha
Getting serious Rick vibes from Conan... hahahaha
Jeesh I thought he was going to die :D
Probably the best episode ever.
He's a mad man 😮😂
My god, so much respect for Conan. Dude just smashed and took shots of the sauce...then goes on to give coherent response of" read well"....
would love to see Jordan Schlansky on Hot Ones
A Charlie Rose show with hot wings, lol.
I said it and Ghandi said it. And Popeye.
Conan is “That Guy” 😄👏🏽
He's really funny, but sometimes Conan needs to rein himself in a bit.
The day conan met god
The show and Conan jumped the shark. Haven't watched in a while and definitely not watching again.
best episode ever!
CONAN IS LEGEND
...  Watch anything Norm Macdonald.  To add to the wisdom of Conan's list.  Give it time.
This platform come a long way i remember when it begin wow amazing
it's gonna be real hard to top this episode. Conan absolutely killed it here. GG
11:32 I’m glad there was no beef with the buffalo, props to Conan for being professional
I rather go on a date with conan than ice spice after watching her video
Conan has always been to me the best and funniest talkshow host of all time. I'm glad this generation is finally coming to this realisation.
I truly thought there was blood coming from Conan’s ears. That was epic.
Dear Hot ones. I still have the hotter version of da bomb, ground zero. I used to play practical jokes in college.  It now has a 16 year vintage on it.  Keep it going
Barry Sander’s
Barry Sanders
Get Barry Sanders
Phenomenal by Conan
Conan O'Brien will always be GOAT to me! He is SO damnd badass! ❤❤❤
It’s a tie: Watching Sean put on a tiny dab and Conan pour it on and down it in awesome Three Stooges hilarity as Conan’s eyes turn fire red & his face turns 6 shades away from tomato🍅 🫠😅😂
Nobody’s gonna talk about the bones in the pocket😂😭
Lol this shook me to my core. I want tim heidecker on the show
Conan = Where did you go to school?  Doctor = 1998 😂
Really starting to get tired of O'Brien talking about how he got his job (how he didn't get his job), and being a childish Irish clown.  Jordan Shlansky vids are more interesting, although bit overbearing on the schlanksy.  This however, reminds me why O'Brien is gold.
BEST DROP EVER! CONAN IS KIIINNGGGG!!!!
This is by far one of the funniest episodes of Hot ones 😂😂
@ 26:20 when Conan’s roar and Hot Ones Viking meet 🔥🔥🔥
This was so fn funny like old school Conan on Late Night. Best episode ever.
This one was rigged
The best one I've EVER seen!!!
Ok... this was the best.. Conan was perfect.. and ya... i know it was hot.. but wow.. you gave a show.
BEST EPISODE EVER!
The attitude and the hair made me want Josh Homme on here…
well i'll be watching his show on Max
Lol he's the best ever!
He didn’t cough, didn’t sweat, didn’t stop…JESUS. D.J Khalid not going past Tapatio seems less important now that we have seen the face of God
I’m dieing haha
Guy's just took over man!! 😂😂 WILDEST EPISODE EVER!!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 CONGRATS TEAM!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
I just realized Sean got fake teeth…he dated a pornstar, he’s got fake teeth and I bet next he’s buying a Ferrari if he hasn’t already. Full midlife crisis mode
The only thing he didn't do was put his hand down his pants.
That man is the real life Joker
This is peak youtube content 👌 👏 🙌
We didn't see Chris match Conan bite for bite, pour for pour, or sip for sip. Too bad as it would have been great to see them ride off the rails together.
Best episode ever. Wing drop!
Cohen was an absolute MAD MAN here.
This one deserves more than Gordon Ramsay
I bought the bomb a month ago and i ve been training myself to endure more spice. And i can say what conan did with the bomb was actually insane.
Legend ❤️
You know what man? Conan still got it. I laughed alot during this episode. I never cared about any late night guys, except Conan. He's such a goof. Love it. 😅
Conan is officially an American national treasure. Incredibly done Conan.
This is weird.  I always wished that Conan were a skateboarder before showbiz.  He would know what falling 5 or 6' onto concrete feels like 😄🛹☀️❤️
When lizard people try and feel human feelings
This is not funny at all.
This one is awesome
This guy has never been funny, this just keeps confirming it.
We love you, Conan! You still got it
WINNER! 😮
No one can replace ANTHONY BOURDAIN.
Is Conan coked up? 🤔
Without a doubt, the best Hot Ones yet!
that was insane😂😂😂😂😂
I feel like Conan would give himself a hot sauce enema if it would be good for ratings.
Conan absolutely came and conquered every aspect of this episode.  Shawn was just there in spirit.
Conan just went off the rails and had a nervous breakdown
Get dave Patel on hot ones
This one was AMAZING!!!❤❤❤
Do NOT travel Texas, the most miserable place on planet earth
I feel like he's Trumps younger brother
This is the best Hot Ones ever
Conan is legend! Haven’t laughed like that in a good while. 😂
BEST EPISODE EVER
This is the best hot ones episode by far.
😂😂😅😅😅
Best episode  first we feast  everr Had
Always respected Conon always comes out with a way to make people smile or laugh he is such a classic man when it comes to entertainment I respect him truly
This is peak hot ones….. you cant top this.
dr. ro royal hahaha
Awesome!!!
Best guest by far!
What an animal.  I give him 5 years, tops.
Please go back to 1 table
Conan is nutz!!!
The only First We Feast video that I have watched from starting all the way through the end! My man! I laughed my pants off, and just like Conan said, you are a great interviewer dude! And Conan is legendary!
My jaw was literally dropped and I was wide eyed for the last portion of the video
You won't be able to top that one in a million years.
BRAVO!!! ENCORE!!!
This is literally the most I ever heard the host guy laugh he really was actually real laughing,, leave it to Conan to bring that out of him, Conan is a special energy I expected a good show,, and he delivered as always
Never laughed so hard.😂
I always took Conan for a total wuss until now.
WITHOUT QUESTION BEST GUEST YET\
Did Conan write Dr. Nick Rivera's episodes?
😂
this is so inspirational i dont know why.
Oh dear god.. is.. Conan going to be okay? lol
Conan ripped off An Idiot Abroad and shall never be forgiven.   By the way ghosts aren't real.
Ccccc
Beast!!!!❤
Conan is the goat
Nothing can top this!!  All of the other videos look boring after watching Conan’s lol
This was hilarious. Maybe best show yet….?
next ufc main card... Conan O'Brien v DJ Khaled.
Conan the Wing Slayer!!
The Bea Arthur bit took me out😂
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
My names max
Seriously… That’s not humanly possible.   How? How in the world did he do that?
Conan is the Hot Ones final boss
Why is DA BOMB so hard with onlye 135k scoville? It seems to hit more than the 2million sauce?
Conan turned into Napoleon Dynamite with them, leftover chicken wings!
I hope Spice Lord God King Conan tells us whatever happened to his body for the next 72 hours. That was some Olympic spice diving.
Best episode by a landslide lol
GOAT!
I watch this at least once a day
Comedy at its peak!!
Absolute Legend. Point Blank Period.
That is the best hot ones yet
Keep talking trash, Conan. You are about to find out.
Conan is a national treasure
That was my birthday too, quaint.
Dont care to watch it but I'm gonna give Sean a thumbs up because he managed to get Conan on and I would as well if I had a channel.
I thought this was going to be great. Absolutely disappointed.
wipe your face man
Conan drank out of the last dab bottle, that's some pure psychopathy worthy of praise.
Get Graham Norton in this show
Conan is a monster or was sedated before the show lol...
Conan = never funny...
He’ll be dropping hot bricks
This was absolutely hysterical. Conan is a legend.
Conan came on here and ruined it for all who follow, because "Mr. Clown Shoes" came on here and sat like a boss, even adding extra sauce. Now all "hard" actors, rappers, celebs are gonna live in that tall Irish shadow.
Unreal. Insane
bro went head in da bomb like he rode that water buffalo
Most crazy performance on this show I seen
Dude is a legend never fails to put a smile on my face
👍🏼
😂😂😂😂 conan is the greatest 🙌 👌 ❤️
Conan will forever be the goat late night personality
Conan was the last "real" late night host.  These other clowns: Colbert, Fallon, Myers, they're just an extension of Establishment propaganda or something.  It's not comedy, that much is for certain.
1998.  Perfect from the jump and doesn’t let go.  Amazing episode!
How much Ketamine did Conan have before he took on this challenge? 🤒🤯😱
Conan is Blonde Elon Musk with a better haircut
he goes full in
Conan is dat dude 4L
That did NOT go the way that I thought it would !! Well done, Conan.
He looks like a melon rotting in the sun
Did anyone recogonize the edgar hopp?
My mouth hurts just from watching
I wish you can get an ex-president on here!
Conan is the only person I know who can still rock jeans and an 80's jean jacket. Conan thanks Sean for doing his research, yet Sean ALWAYS has the deep cut questions.  :) The drooling at the end had me dying!
I knew it was gonna be good, but I wasn't expecting the best episode ever. CONAN O'BRIEN IS THE BEST! LOVE YOU 🔥
Will played Curley in the three stooges movie. (Bravo) I wonder how the original Curley and the rest of the stooges would deal with Dudesy as an AI….
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Greatest episode of all time
24:14 he is just too smart. More than 7,950 billion people on this planet
Man good luck toping that ending 😂
EPIC! This was awsome
Comedy and this red faced chump? Give me a break!
Why is there no clip of him biting the first bite? Looks faked
That was amazing! I think the host was honestly scared. Amazing
The best episode EVER 🙌🏽 🔥🙌🏽
My favorite thus far
Best one EVER!!🤓💜
Beat ever episode. Absolute legend at what he does..arguably the best. absolutely understood and nailed it
He legit said "I bet I can bit my way through this" and then did. He put 6 wings in his pocket.
I love Conan.
outstanding. Best episode ever. Conan came to play,
Alton Brown: i love this sauce I'm taking the bottle   Coman: yeah my half eaten wing is coming with me
10/10
Definitly first in my top 20: 1. Conan 2. Dave Grohl 3. Josh Brolin 4. Jenna Ortega 5. Paul Rudd 6. Tenacious D 7. Kristen Bell 8. Idris Elba 9. Key and Peele 10. Charlize Theron 11. Ricky Gervais 12. Viola Davis 13. Shia LaBoeuf 14. Halle Berry 15. Daniel Kaluuya 16. Elizabeth Olsen 17. John Bernthal 18. Jennifer Lawrence 19. Bobby Lee 20. Gordon Ramsey   I just noticed that Conan and Bill Burr are wearing the same jacket on Hot Ones 😂 Is it a thing for men after their fifties? Excellent episode. You can hardly top that. Unless he comes with Jordan Schlanski or Andy Richter. It's comedy gold.
We need David goggins on hot ones
Conan has entered the Steve-O period of his career, and I love it
Conan is a genius! Always has a foil/sidekick to play off of, though he probably doesn't need one. A legendary figure in American culture. By the way, the new show was so funny it had me in tears a couple of times. I'm a lifelong fan.
Favorite episode ever ❤
I think it's time to have Dr Disrespect on the show!
Conan is deranged!
That was insane and I loved every second of it.  I don't envy the person who has to clean up after that, though 😂😂
This was the most disgusting hot ones episode. I couldn’t even finish watching it. I know Conan was trying to be funny and entertain but it was just awful.
cody rhodes next sean
10 million views in 10 days for Conan
How?
Love that he calls Leno the other guy
Sooooooo GREAT!!!!!
Doctor Arroyo!
Greatest Episode Ever….Michael Gary Scott This is Your Chance To See CONAN(ALL CAPS) “The Barbarian” O’Brien….CONAN, MAN YOU ARE PURE COMEDIC GENIUS & I wouldn’t let Nobody Bother You Bro…!!! Im watching your new show on MAX…!!! Conan For The Next JOKER 🃏 VS. BATMAN….SHEESH
I don't fear your wings man
His commitement to acting is so high that he ignores pain. Now thats class.
Respect. What a showman.
Legendary guest Hall of Fame
this is such an incredible episode. unlike some other entertainers, Conan is on someone else's show qnd delivers qnd puts in qs muh effort as if he were his own show. Gotta respect that.
The man, the myth, the legend, bravo
This is the best hot ones episode. Conan O Brien feels more like a host in this episode than Sean himself and I laugh every 2 minutes in this episode. Conan also took all these sauces very lightly and it was awesome.
9:26 If he gets Ric Flair on the show, that’d be 🔥.
44k comments, fk it, I'll still say it, Conan is the greatest of our time  Best host and entertainer by Volume not Weight
SCREAM laughing!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
I’m feeling this one a little bit ☝🏽  *slowly gets red*  Dude I gained a whole nother level of respect for Conan   Manz brought his own bit to the bit cause THIS IS LIFE !
HE DRANK IT!
He is a Legend ❤😂
I don’t think Dr. Arroyo went to medical school lol
The best TV host of all time
Someone should check Conan for internal-bleeding after the 8th wing😂😂 he's started changing colour 😅
Oh. God so gross
crazy that this was more chaotic than eric andre
Conan is the GOAT
That was an experience. Instant classic.
Can you please get Brandon Sanderson? He is a super interesting person and he can handle his spice.
I bet Conan’s dry cleaners love him
I vote for the buffalo footage to be released!
He's insanely smart and funny- I cannot believe he drank hot sauce. The doctor was hilarious. Thank you - the chase was worth it- probably the best hot wings show yet!
The best hot ones yet.
The GOAT
22:30 Thats where I lost it XD
Suede jacket got my attention as well 😅😂
I could watch a thousand hours of Conan and not laugh. The guy isn’t funny
Conan was the BEST!!! 🔥
He's so good at what he does, which is to have the dial at 11 and the button broke. Correction: He broke the button himself!
This was the best episode😂😂😂
He should probably retire to the wonderful, peaceful country of Haiti.
16:53
Hands down best episode so far. Conan needs to a round 2
I rarely comment on YouTube I think ppl never see comments here but I just need to say. I’ve been a fan since Sean Evans was interviewing olschool rappers. Love this show, but this interview with Conan was disgusting and not even funny. If I was an alien trying to understand humans and saw this I’d wanna destroy the earth.. Old white comedian man eats and sweats like influenza dog and laughs...
EPIC
A truly historic moment in comedy
This was fantastic content
This whole episode is a "show and tell" for the bull story. Someone said hop on and he's off the rails.
The whole "Can I keep these?" and then sticking the wings in his pocket bit is so fkin funny and the fact he mentions it everytime he puts one in there is great. Conan is something else man.
This commitment has sold me on the show
fing greatest showman ever
absolutely fantastic
Sean was a great guest on this show.
Conan is the best guest yet
just LEGEND!!!!!!!!!!!
The outro has massive Rick and Morty energy.
This is definitely one of the best episodes
Go Conan !! 😂❤
This has to be the best episode !!  🎉
I didn’t realise that this is a real interview rather than a advertisement for Conan Must Go until I read the comments 😂 I tried to figure out if the guy “pretend” to interview Conan is Jordan😅
Day 4679 of asking for SHANE GILLIS!!!
I love how Conan completely made up a story about Warren G. Harding
Conan debunks hot ones
This is the best Hot Wings ever
And where in Finland is the Tundra area? Best regards: All Finns😂😂😂😂
I completely lost it at 23:45 when he’s calmly taking about reading in the most pain possible, sauce all over his face eyes watering, drooling, and the bottle of Da Bomb slowly spilling all over the table. Comedy gold. As absolutely unhinged as one would hope it would be.
The real reason he is pocketing the wings: doesn’t want to be cloned. His genius (and hair) must be only 1/1.
Conspiracy theory: Conan did that crazy show only to mesmerise the internet and over take the Katt Williams participation on that legendary podcast a few months ago...
Believe it or not, this man saved me from a near suicide depression❤ You mean the world to me Conan
Sean didn’t “mirror the guest” this episode 🤣🤣
And trust, he was in the bathroom later.
Da Bomb remains undefeated!!!!!
Wow....just wow!
Same stethoscope on both tongues?
probably best guest no questions
LEGENDARY
This is the mountain top to climb if you ever want to inscribe your name in the annals of Hot Ones
Prob the best episode I have seen… legendary imo
He's on another level
Best episode YET!!!!!!
The greatest hot wings episode ever.
I have watched this show ever since it stated...Conan has definitely done the best one. I would love to see more people go out like this.😊
he never drops his act
Ive never seen anything like that. I think Sean might be traumatized!
I think he needs a napkin...
Very good episode 😅😂!! 👏 😂 conan is a beast!!
I don't get the skit with the doctor 😕 doctors study for ten plus years and work so hard and expose themselves to extreme conditions to save lives literally for them to be mocked like this by someone in show business !
conan o'lying, fake to the core
can someone check on conan 😆
Conan should run for president.
Rubbing pepper sauce on your lips is crazy. Conan probably had so much botox he feels nothing on his face.
"Funny everywhere and in everything" precisely right, read everything you can because it's not what is written that makes it immediately funny, it's how you deliver it.
Um.... Conan pretty much owed this over by a landslide. How would anyone follow this? Conan... Mic drop. Winner.
Finland mentioned! :)
🗣️🚨🤬”DR ARROYO”😡🚨🗣️
Conan broke the game. 🤣🤣🤣
I hope Conan lives forever
George motz but replace the wings with burger sliders
Conan toped the performance of Steve'O and now he's officially became Conan'O! Sky is the limit for this guy.. And that's how you promote your stuff! Now I really have to watch that show)
This was so incredible, definitely one of my favourites 😂😂
When he said Max (HBO) I thought he was talking about Max Weinberg
Good lord
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂what a way to end a season 🎉😂❤❤❤ Conan is a sport ❤😅😅😂😂😂😂😂
I’m not gonna lie, so far Halley Berry killed the wings better than anyone else on this show. Cleaned the wings and danced and didn’t even drink anything.
I absolutely love Conan. This was a great episode 😂
IT'S NOT A  BIT, THIS IS LIFE
Im sorry, I am a hugeeeee Conan fan, but this is not it, he seems like hes trying too hard. Conan's genius was intelligent subtle remarks with such ease, and perfect timing. This seems forced and unnecessary over the top. This is so hard to watch for me, i guess I will have to go back and watch his old stuff
Pure chaos and mayhem
I love how he switches the noun from "they" to "he" (about "Max"). Adn actually, the whole talk about HBO vs. Max. We just witnessed the improv game happening live.
For everyone addicted to watching Conan's remotes on YouTube, this episode is exactly what we expected. Conan is 100% dedicated to getting good footage and entertaining the audience as much as possible. A true master of improve and foolishness.
Wow. That was visceral. Conan just went hard AF. He is now relevant to the younger kids he just flexed so hard in front of. I approve.
Conan The Comedy Great!
Conan, that’s all I got. Genius and unhinged.
I laughed so hard at this!!!!!!!!! This man is a legend
this episode by far is the best episode on hot ones
I hope Conan goes to Moscow some day. Would love to get a photo with him
I love Conan. So hilarious
What a gangster
Sean its time for the greatest interview in the world. You vs Nardwuar
This was the best and hilarious Episode ever. Conan is the best Host and the best guest A true legend!😃
Conan’s soliloquy at the end was like the Great dictator speech by Charlie Chaplin
that’s not conan.  that’s lisan al gaibbbbb.  😩😂❤️
Can we get Kate Micucci on?
Hilarious
Conan was an absolute comedy beast! I laughed until I cried!
I saw him put the last dab bottle on his lips?!!!
Man, the next day it's gonna be ruff
Genius.
CONAN i havnt liked you in years but your inside chris farley cameout goodjob sir.
Bow to king!
we need COMAN on mssp for a president breakdown like L.C.K
Conan is KING!!!! 🤴
"... oh, it's building" ☠
Conan o' Alien
Thats one blaze of glory my eyes cant unsee 🫣😵😵💀
Conan is top G.
The fact that Conan still does the Ace Ventura comb over is so inspirational.
I was already a Conan fan - for a long time.. But still, this is by far my fav episode on Hot Ones!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Funny, interesting and more funny!!!!!!!!!! Hard to ever top this one!!!!!
Ok, guess I'm a Conan fan now. Holy buckets what a bit!
Absolute genius
Genius
Onan would play an amazing gangster
LISAN AL GAIB
Intense is all i can say. wow
Conan is legend ! The best
Conan makes everything better. GOAT
Whether or not you like Conan or not, he's done talk shows forever, but he's never been mean.
This is one of the best hot wings I've ever seen
Best episode of all time
Can we just acknowledge that the real FINAL BOSS is not The Rock, but Conan O'Brien!!!
Nothing to add to the first 5 comments: their authors understand the meaning and the reason of Conan’s performance.
Nobody will ever top this...that is why I miss the Conan show and 4 episodes are still very less...
10/10
Was expecting Conan, the talk show host, to be eating hot wings. Got Conan the barbarian devouring little demons on a plate.
Possibly the best episode ever.  IMO
I love deranged hot mouth Conan
🤓🐔
He's a mad man and I love him!
Easily the funniest episode I've seen so far... Conan is a legend!
🤣😂Conan is a national treasure!!!!
This was excellent
Conan on his soon to be dead tour
Conan brings a bit with him lol
Wow. He's either got a lot of botox or he is a true professional. The straightest face of anyone completing this.
It was the worst show. I couldn’t watch till end.
I don't care what anybody said, this is the wackiest, crazy show hot ones has ever had. My favourite episode by far.
BALLET PIZZA 🍕🍕🍕says hello
There will never be anyone that can compare to him in any way shape or form.
This show every so often hits a new peak, this is up there with Paul Rudd
I grew up with him love him did I just get the Chris Farley influence? 🤯
My favorite episode ever
The moment of regret hitting after licking DaBomb.
Thank you Conan for agreeing that Max is truly the worst name change outside of Twitter/X
Conan’s a lunatic and I love it
This gave me such bad Anxiety!
As a comedic journalist in his own right Sean fell back and gave Conan grace,Sean Evans is a gentleman,I love him ❤
Didn't Conan write on that Simpsons episode where Homer ate the Guatemalan insanity pepper??? Just sayin.
I think Conan has cemented his place in the top 10 of Hot Ones!
Conan never disappoints.
I would want to talk about Conan writing on the Simpsons for hours.
Best guest ever.
I Miss Conan  The Hot  Sauce Master and Craziest Episode and Guest ever
What a guy
over the top
CALL THE WIFE!!
First time I’ve ever seen Sean not match a guest! Swear this is a GOAT…ish? episode.
Hahahahaa the best episode so faaaaar 😱
That was amazing.  Conan is the GOAT.
Can we get Doug Stanhope next session?
conan would be a great joker
The doc was like Max Weinberg
sean is the worst host of all time
Greatest Hot Ones yet!
I would give a standing ovation! 😂
What an amazing show!
The absolute BEST one I've seen. Love him!
1st time I ever had to fast forward the show.
Who else thought he was going to dump it into his eyes?
Conans the goat
love the man, in the year 2000...........
Has anyone done that to Da Bomh before??? Oh my goodness 🤯😂
Fantastic episode. It's definitely my new favorite.  Great season!
*Conan starts pouring more Bomb on the wing* me: oh no... Conan...
Conan would have eaten graphite from Chernobyl for the bit.
Best one ever
Wow
This is Conan's body metabolizing hot sauce into hard alcohol & Red Bull
22:30 me
Conan is just pure Gold.
Greatest ep yet, comedic icon.
Absolutely loved this. Conan is the best
What a showman!
GOAT!
Conan wasn't affected by this salsas because he developed a strong resistance when he made Conan In Mexico 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan killed it!!! 😂
i like how each sauce he takes, the more he loses his sanity
Conan is the absolute GOAT.
Best episode ever
Easily the best guest so far
Conan was so right to give Sean his props for being a fantastic interviewer. He lets people talk. But what Conan did here is an absolute masterpiece. Best episode yet!
Dr. Arroyo has a cousin named Leo Spaceman
And thus a classic internet video that will live long was birthed.
Best this season!!!!!  Conan never disappoints!
<deweycox>Conan O'Brien died three minutes after this was taped</deweycox>
Might as well just stop the show after that one. No one’s gonna top that 😂
“A wise and stable man” 😂😂😂
Move over Steve-O..... Conan will do anything for a laugh.  Love that man
23:00 This is the moment that truly describes Conan's life He suppressed the pain of pepper as he suppressed the pain of his life
Best episode ever...hilarious !!!
8M views  !!!!
Top 3 episodes for sure!! Conan killed it
I nominate Werner Herzog for the next episode of hot ones!
I've watched over 30 of your videos and this guy (Conan) is by far the worst guest you have had on. He is a flop. Maybe he is funny on his own show but he just comes across as a Hollywood Hack in this video.
Coco is a beast
Clearly Conan learned nothing from that water buffalo incident...
That was my first Conan O'Brien experience.. and I'm not disappointed. 😅
In the UK four is a spice
What a legend, I hope he is okay
I think he over did it.
This was phenomenal
Perfection.
Conan will always be a legend in my eyes. He's the only late night host that has ever made me silent laugh for minutes at a time. Loved this episode! 😁
He's the real definition of selfless showman.
You don’t know what real danger looks like anymore is such an incredible line.
I cried, I laughed . Best ever!!!
Best guest EVER!!! Conan❤❤❤
I love it!!!! Conan is Hilarious!!! Amazing🤣🤣🤣🙌
I say Conan's echoing "wooooo" and "ooohh yeeeaahhh" should become recurring background sound effects for appropriate opportunities
Keeping those bones for a spicy chicken stock👀
If it burns in, burns out. RIP
Conan is clinically insane
I think Mike should have made it work with Lana/Amara- he was too hung up on what other people said & thought ,You fumbled the girl of your destiny ,she would died for you,she was so emotionally intelligent...having been married before ,she was years ahead of your wants and needs,she put your needs and wants before hers. A true ruby in the dust,rare and unique and full of mystique.
Conan didn't just beat the game and destroy the final boss. He did all the side quest and got all the bonus points
I would love a little 1 minute follow up to learn how Conan felt the next day! This was amazing and I was literally laughing out loud. I’ve chuckled at some prior guests and it’s always interesting but this was AMAZING!
All of them
Does he use new bottles of hot sauce each ep?
I enjoyed this so much I actually laughed cried and to people who know me I usually just smile when some real funny stuff is on. With Conan I actually LOL.
I love conan's trick of answering the pre-interview questionaire with "1, no tolerance for hot sauce" and then actually breezing through all the way to the final 3. So worth the wait. Love the last dab. And then the deranged raving and slobbering to follow.
This might be the best episode ever knew of the guy but now he has my respect 🫡
watching conan got me through some very depressing and lonely parts of my life when he was with the peacock.  always respected and appreciated his craft. incredibly intelligent comedic talent. he's my late night goat.
Is it just me or did Conan not really sweat at all? 😂
ONE OF THE BEST!!!
Legend status
This is the absolute favorite best episode of Hot Ones yet. Conan O'Brien  had an assignment and he nailed it. Great show!
the way the sauce is just chilling on his lips ????
Conan is such a legend.
Gonna be hard to top this episode!
Sean needs to be a guest on Conan O'Brien needs a friend
the besttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
I see Conan, I click Conan.
Conan replacing Arnold as Conan the Destroyer
Conan is the biggest chad that’s ever been on this show. Brings his own physician and drinks hot sauce. Has never been done. No one will ever out do this man.
Occupation hazard when you're MC. You control the show wherever you go lol.
Offer the man a napkin... please! :)
Conan turns into Master Shake at the end.
A comedy legend puts us through a masterclass.
Get Eminem on
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is that the same jacket Bill Burr wore on this show?
His inner beauty came out
I'm watching the show not because I'm interested but because this performance demands it.
This is the best one yet
Wait isn’t that pepper x sauce only tested at 51k Scoville units ?
Incredible. One funny MFer
Conan is an idiot politically
I was feeling warm fuzzies at the Farley tribute at 21:10
Conan is a Golden God!
Conan's commitment is just so awesome! Just stuff the pain aside and keep going
You get some generational talents in every field. Talented humans who seem to defy reality and seem otherworldly, impressing even those who are very good at the same craft.   The musician who does things that don't scientifically make sense with their instrument...  The athlete who does things that don't scientifically make with their body...  Conan is the generational talent in improv comedy. Even other comedians and comics stare in awe at the creativity and audacity of the man.   It gets overused, but this man is an absolute legend.
Best guest ever, Conan killed it 😂
probably the first time.. that sean isnt following the guest LOL
Conan is a comedic genius
Dr. Arroyo is the most qualified doctor I've ever seen.
Do Jordan Schlansky next!
18:31 pause. your welcome
Lisan al Gaib!!!
Conando
The commitment to his comedy is unparalleled haha the very best! Ever!
By far the best one yet
I cried, this is gold
Was it just coincidental that he chose Da Bomb of all sauces for this move of sheer madness?
If I could like this a gazillion times I would! LOL!  😂😂😂
This makes up for the ice spice episode
Conan is just the best there ever was
this may be the best ep
It's because he's meeting his eye-dew
My mom: go to bed Me: I’m watching Conan  I’m 36 now and still love this dude.
IT USED TO BE HBO BUT PEOPLE FOUND THAT TOO POPULAR
Lorde's dad
Conan must be a bird that's the only explanation. (Birds are immune to capcsaicin.)
Im gonna go check out his show now. He sold me on this one.
Sean was genuinely concerned 😂
Has to be one of the best episodes of Hot Ones ever created.  Thanks Conan for making my childhood and adulthood full of laughs.
The world needs a Dr Arroyo sitcom, what a great piece of comedy that was.
Dr. Arroyo was the valedictorian of 1998.
Like - to see Nathan Bargatze on the show
"so this is pure pepper ?" as if there could some sort of  flavour to look for xD
Reptilian
You gotta love Conan! He lost his mind but still controlled the show. Genius!
This has to be the best
Conan makes Steve-O look like a wuss 🤣🤣🤣🤣😎
This was excelent!
Absolutely, unhinged; Love it.
that rant about the search for comedy was great
The best episode of Hot Ones ever…
This whole thing felt like malicious compliance lol
13:57 is by far the biggest power move I've seen anyone pull on the show. Absolutely bossed it!  You can drop the curtain on the show now, this will not be topped.
This MIGHT BEAT THE GORDON RAMSEY 😳 EPISODE!!! What did I just watch 😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow I wasn't expecting this but also was. This was the most insane and best episode ever!! Conan just drank all the sauces and ate every wing without a problem
This was insane!
Conan Is the man is he still alive??
LEGEND
Funniest show ever, BUT I WAS TRULY AFRAID FOR CANAAN. i love that dude!
It's official...  Conan is the wing king.  Has anyone done it better, honestly?
Conan is the man. I wanna get the free month of max and cancel just to watch conan and band of brothers.
This is the funniest fcking thing I've seen on the internet in a long time. Conan is the fcking GOAT!
If anyone wants to see more of Conan reacting to Hot Sauce, watch Murderville Episode 1!
Conan clears any other talk show host. Id rather have him on air than kimmel
Got to be one of the funniest interviews ever
You're  the best Conan
Never laughed so hard
GOAT
This is by far one of the best episodes. Period!
I haven't laughed like this in so long
Sensational.
Absolutely beautiful 🤣👏👏
What a Legend!
I watch fhis daily
Was the water buffalo incident just foreshadowing for what happened when get got to the final sauces?
What a champ!
Man, Conan went hostile.
You can see Conan lose his mind at the end 😨
Of all those "late shows", Conan is the one worth watching.
Conan doing shtick is odd. But high praise for Sean's interviewing skills. More out there than Steve-O
I love Conan.
Instead of answering the questions with words, Conan used actions to do so. Really intelligent person!
This is gold.
That was hilarious
Absolutely the best Hot Ones ever!  Conan is a living legend!
Call the wife!
It's wild that a channel this big doesn't have proper captioning.
Brooos is the fire🔥🔥🔥❤
Loved the way he turned to a philosopher at the end , real legend😂
What is happening haha
Best dam interview!!! Hahahha love it
Best show!!!
FAV COMEDIAN
"My mission is to learn nothing about the country"  That's not travelling, that's being an American
Best guest yet!
Conan will always- always be the GOAT.   Irreplaceable.
New level of respect for Conan O’Brien 🔥 😮
*"What's wrong with you people?! You don't know what real danger looks like anymore!"* Conan being the dad all Zoomers needed.
Can we get a side series of reaction videos with previous guests reacting to Conan's episode? K? You're welcome.
CONAN IS DEFINITELY a GOAT🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 who can be a better host than him ❤❤❤❤❤
The fact that he was a fking mess at the end is GOLD!!!  Him plugging his show made me hit the floor 😭😭😭🤧
This is the most insane episode I've seen
Norm Macdonald would have been glorious on Hot Ones
"CALL THE WIFE!!" 😂
I'll always know that Conan was one of the first big guy hollywood media outlets that openly welcomed the coming of technology. He's been on the youtube train for a long time, so when he says "I've seen your work and you're a great interviewer"  I can believe him actually understanding the dynamic of having online only interviews with no live audience.
Best ever!
just great entertainment 😁🤣
What an amazing episode. Great job to everyone. Anyone heard from Conan?
At the end, he was on a hot sauce high.  And he is still crying on the toilet to this day. 😂😮😂😮😂
He did a lot better than I thought he would.
Great stuff. Love Conan. Might have to shell out for that hbo max sub.
Megalord Conan.  King of entertainment.
Life is just a bit for Conan. The guy is always doing bits even when the cameras are not filming, his friends have told this multiple times on interviews. That's the reason why Conan is the best talk show host ever and one of the funniest comedians ever, he is always perfecting his craft and trying new things. I think I'm nowhere near alone when I say that I will really miss him when he decides to stop making comedy, it's already weird he is gone from hosting a talk show because I was a mere child when I saw him on TV the first time in the beginning of the 2000's. I'm 34 now so I have been a fan over a half of my life already
Conan´s the best
"Read widely and read well".
Instant classic
The applause at 25:28 seemed to genuinely catch him off guard, his face is darting around trying to make sense of it. Adds credence to the controlled meltdown minutes beforehand being genuine, and not just hammed up.
When the guest makes the host feel welcomed.
Could you please consider getting rid of the background music you use? It's the same template of music every video, but the music escalates in a way that never fits the vibe/mood of the interview. It's not serving any purpose, and if anything is a distraction!
why are you guys still doing 2 tables?
Greatest episode ever 😂
bro is unhinged omfg 😂💀
😂 mad man
Yo 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
DUDE WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE BOMB THIS IS CRAZY
If I didn’t know Conan I would’ve said he is on some snow 😂😂
Till date one off the best episode 😂🎉
Conan always goes all in.. class act
Conan is probably the greatest celebrity to ever exist
Sit perfectly still, only I may dance. Never been truer 😂😂😂
Do you this Conan had a severe flu that caused his tongue to go numb so he could devour all that hot sauce? I had a sever flu once and I lost all my sense of smell and taste so everytime I wanted to eat I put so many hot sauce on my food so I could at least taste flavor when I eat... so maybe thats what happened to conan?
Love Conan
This was hands down the funniest video❤❤
May peace be with you Conan!
Like watching Madonna on stage doing aerobics
"Why can't I feel anything..."  I think that was sincere. SEND HELP
A train wreck. I can't look away!
'BRAGADOCIOUS' SPOT ON!
So awkward
Hot ones peaked. There is no way anyone will top this. Sean should probably call it quits after this. This episode should win an Emmy
We need a Conan and Eric Andre sauce off. They might be the most chaotic guests I've seen.
Conan took drugs before the show...obviously
" I like to announce my mistake upfront " I thought that was really funny
I love Conan
Coonan is the fkn man..
Can I keep these? 🍗 👀
Absolute LEGEND
Legend
Always loved Conan. Great job
That was probably the best performance I've seen on the show yet 😂
sean saying "don't do it" while conan was opening another hot sauce bottle man was genuinely concerned at how far conan was willing to go for a bit
Joel edgerton should play conan in "conan: the movie"
That's it. That's a wrap. Conan wins 😂😂😂
This man is a true and tested LEGEND
Conan, there are people of all ages, including the few people older than you (but unlikely older, because you’re old as f), that love what you do. You’re the class comedian, with class. The guy we’ve always liked, from your first day in front of the camera to now.
This is the best episode I’ve seen in a long time. Possibly the best ever.
That was so awesome.
Conan is the 🐐 guest. That was so entertaining 😆🙏🏿
For a few minutes, I literally was afraid to touch my eyes with my fingers watching Conan and his fingers with all that sauce on!
Well, Conan is an absolute lunatic. We know this now.
Wow......this is the most wild Hot Ones by a long mile! Good luck topping this one 😂🤣😂🤣!
I laughed a lot, but also this seems like a cry for help by Conan!
Conan's commitment towards his craft is next to nothing.
What an amazing episode
I never realized how funny Conan is, til now 😂
This is why we call Conan a legend. Crushed even the hot ones. No frontiers left for him to crush.
Conan, Chicken Wings, Dr. Arroyo, Ghandi & Popeye. Epic!
The Highest VIEW to LIKE ratio of all Videos!
I love how he gradually becomes the color of his pompodor.
GET JORDAN SCHLANSKY!!! I  I would love to see if he is really human lol
Should of brought Jordan Schlansky to try the various sauces lol
Conan is so professional, he stole the show
Lets pray Conan does not get even more out of hand by putting hot sauce on his private parts because if he does.... he won't need one of Elon Musks space ships to go into orbit very fast.
I like Conan O'Brien!  He is soo missed in late night!  He is a nut!!!
He brought his own dr 🤣😂🤣🤣😂 I want to see the buffalo thing
Hands down THE BEST EPISODE EVER MADE. Conan NEVER desappoint where ever he goes.
That was the funniest GD thing I’ve watched all year. Conan is a master.   TEAM COCO!
NGL, at the start I was a bit annoyed the he was obviously doing a bit and wasn't just being himself but as soon as the bit went totally off the rails all was forgiven. 😂
I wish I could give this more thumbs up
This is by far the best episode Hot Ones that I have ever seen 😂😂😂
I need to see him on last meals 😂
He’s gone full Tim and Eric
Conan's the craziest guest on this show the way he destroyed those hot sauces. If the show does hall of fame for their guests, Conan's the first inductee. 😂
No one has ever owned sauces 8 through 10 like that - not even close!  LOLOLOL
Conan’s right, God has a great sense of humor in scripture.
I don't think there's a lot of people who can actually handle being given conan-clearance
He got right up on that proverbial water buffalo, and then licked it.
Been a while I've enjoyed an episode so much. Crazy adventure, love it.
Conan is simply amazing!  Miss him on late night.  One of the best that ever did it!
What a legend.
CONAN LIKE IF THE JOKER COME TO  Hot Ones
🤡
Best Hot ones episode ever. 🔥🔥🔥
This episode is in a class of its own 😂. No one will ever top this.
Literally best epi ever LOL
the besttttt 😂😂😂🤣
Elon Musk when?
you can end the channel now 😇🥰🤣
I’ve never seen Sean so overwhelmed and dominated. Respect
Nice of Conan to have Sean on his show.
Conan "I was in a ortic circle "O Brian
A comedy vacuum is what we all said after Conan O'Brien wound up. This is a trickle and look at how many of us have come to imbibe. Classic.
"Haiti is great already"
can only connect the dots looking back never forward what a great quote
Best episode EVERRRRRRRRR
OLD CONAN IS BAAAAAAAACK !!!!! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES !!!!! 😂😂
Conan is the Mann!.. fucken awesome
I’ve NEVER laughed so hard
how emberrassing...
That Dr. was hilarious,  prob went to college with Dr. Nick Riviera and Leo Spaceman
what an unhinged yet completely controlled show. what a performance and a great episode!
I bet his stomach was a mess for a week… im a fellow pink man with red hair, we like spice but our guts dont
Throwback to DJ Khaled's reaction to the first wings. What a difference lol
DaBOMB baby.
I've experienced pepper hands. It's when your hands BURN for hours, this happened after I chopped and transferred chillis with my hands. My hands burned HOT for 4 hours, I can't believe he lathered the hot sauce on his hands 😭
Cool. Going back to watching gordon ramsey episode again.
best entertainer out there
Hands down the best episode I have ever seen of this show.
This is pure madness❤
Might be one of the best ones.
I haven't ever screamed out loud to my phone "WIPE YOUR MOUTH" but I'm glad it because of you, Conan.
I think @22:53 is the most concerned Sean's ever looked for a guest's well-being. Fearful even
This is some of the best TV ever. Have always enjoyed seeing Conan in his element, the whole Matt and Sona schtick on the podcast is getting tiring now. Nice hosting Andre Agassi.
goat
That was AWESOME!!! Love your shows but wow that was a great one!! Cheers
😂😂😂, Conan went in on this one. 😂😂😂
Legend
This was by far the most epic episode
“Where’d you go to medical school?” “In 1998.” “Where?!?” “Oh uhh out of state.”  Has the same energy as:  “I’m Dr. Van Nostrand, from the clinic.” “I see, and what clinic is that again?” “That’s correct.” 😆
best episode
CONAN CAME. CONAN SAW. AND MY OH MY, DID CONAN CONQUER!!
THE. GREATEST. FWF. EPISODE. EVER!!!!!
10 million scovil at the tip of the thoung prob feels like eating a granade and Conan did it  boy this guy sure has went through a lot in his life to be able to do that.
Night show legend coco
"You're not a real doctor are you??"   "I should be"
Coco is goat.
L.E.G.E.N.D
Bro Conan will bea good president
My goat
This was the MOST epic episode….am I wrong?🏆
Conan just proved gingers don’t have souls and broke Hot Ones
Conan owned this episode
Conan officially dethrones David Blane
I've never gotten into Conan. He just has a lame, uninteresting personality. I am glad he is successful but I just don't get it.
He has his face he has the blonde hair fallout push that s***say yes to face is the attitude he is the guy where are the sign came from push the idea towards all at 5:00
The best guest yet
Why does noone get a napkin?
I’ve only ever watched Conan as reruns at 2 am on the couch as a kid. He is a true showman.
That was a good show
He's the strongest guest i've ever seen
Only Conan could have stuff all over his face and eat with his mouth open and me not be grossed out…bravo, sir…
A Charlie Rose show that has hot wings…. Brilliant!
My GOAT talk show host and comedian
Fire crotch Elon is hilarious.  Best guest ever.
Conan is a living Legend. Love the guy!
The Fallout backgroud music really makes this piece
the most deranged ep
Gonna have to do a dive into Warren G. Harding now.
Put a camera on Conan and his staffs and you'll get a new season of 'The Office'
Conan O’Brien for president 🇺🇸🦅
hahahaha
The fact he maintains any composure is insane, one of the best episodes
7 MILLION VIEWS DAAAAAAAAAAAAM 🔥🔥
This is the first and only Hot Ones where Sean is completely reacting to everything a guest is doing, he's just along for the ride, Conan is incredible
Hands down best performance! Someone hand him an honorary Indian citizenship.
unhinged as usual😂😂💜💜
Art
A charlie rose show with hot wings 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Now you need to get Steven Yeun and ask about filiming the music video for JYP's song "Fire" before K-pop got really big in the U.S.
My inner child from nearly 30 years ago loves this and gets flashbacks to why he used to stay up so late to watch "weird comedy" and has a side stitch from laughing so hard. Best episode ever from a dude whos watched all the hot ones.
Why does he speak in ad read
Conan, please come to the Philippines. :) please read this comment. :(
wow conan killed it
This has to be the best one all around.
My hat to this man… 👍Genius conan
When I first scrolled past I thought it was a Gordon Ramsey puppet
I had a suspicion that when the pepper high kicked in so would the ADHD, was not disappointed
Comparing this to Gordon Ramsay's is very night and day 😂
This had me smiling so much my face hurts.
what u guys dont realize, conan is Botox up! he has no feeling. thats how he did this....
This was a pleasure to watch. wonderful.
Conan is such class. What a legend
Conan is a legend!!!!
Anyone else find it so weird when you hear Conan say the F word or curse. I mean I grew up watching him on network tv don’t know if I ever missed and episode. Just feels so odd hearing him curse 😂
The absolute greatest
2 minutes in when we meet Dr. Arroyo, I already know im gonna love this episide 🤣
Fake
You can really tell this guy was one of the key writers of the Simpsons.
Savage
What an incredible performance by Conan, always loved him but greatly increased respect for him after this. He took the show seriously, giving great answers, acknowledging the great questions and hosting by Sean, and just absolutely took over giving 150%. Love this man
Conan said that this is all fun, but you are a great interviewer and you ask great questions. That is my favorite part of this episode.
such unfunny guy...
The best guest ever 🎉 23:25 😂😂😂😂😂
Tremendous!
THE BEST EPISODE EVER!!! When he said that Sean is a great interviewer, I felt like proud momma! Your success is beyond huge. Here in İstanbul, Turkey I love every episode you drop! A "Hot Ones" and even spicier food fan I am. Luv u SEAAAN!
He tipped the local funeral parlor handsomely for the pre taping makeup application.
What I love about Conan is he always gives 150%. No matter what the situation, he goes above and beyond to be as entertaining as possible.
I pity the person who has to wash his toilet the day after..
Wow. Really happy to see Conan here. Considering he's an irish, the amount of hot sauce he handled, was commendable. The Best episode ever with the GOAT of Late night.
The greatest show there ever was right here.
This has to be the best episode of 2024 or ever.
This was special for Sean. You could just tell.
Sean seemed uncomfortable this episode.
this is the funniest one for sure
Best ever....
20:57 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
"What's wrong with me, why can't I feel?" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Holy dear lord. The greatest of all time.
Never in my life have i seen a more manly man
Best hot ones yet, and there's been some good ones.
Why do they still use two tables? Why not just get a longer table?
I feel like this is how Robin Williams  episode would  have went  😅 if he was still with us.
This man is  a god 😅😂 of comedy 😅.  I hope  he good 👍 🙏 🙌
WHY IS HE DRINKING THE HOT SAUCE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I never saw an episode where the crew applauded in the end
What a clown :) Nope. Never liked him and not going to watch his shows for sure
The Wing Drop was epic😂😂😂
I grew up in an irish house, I didnt see a spice until I was 52 years old 🤣
Bravo
What a legend!!
i haven’t laughed that hard in a while. 😭
The best one yet! Connan put some respek on the name!
Bro Conan took the show by storm. Loved the energy he always has
Hail the comedy master
I love Conan & that plug was hilarious. HBO has gone downhill since MAX took over. But this wasn’t legit. You can see the edits between him adding the sauce & eating the wings. There’s no need to edit those moments unless it’s fake. Conan is hilarious, but this discredits HO’s authenticity. I’ve been wondering if they manipulate the sauces or show.
22:56 The cut back to Conan has me cackling.
Haha this was awesome!
Conan chugging 2.6m scolls and spinning in his seat like he's in The Exorcist. Best Hot Ones so far! 👍
The bull story feels like the foreshadowing of the second half of this episode - Conan is a legend, who dives into challenges headfirst
Conan smashed it..
So nice to see Sean getting the recognition he deserves from one of the greatest hosts of all time.
Coming back to this video now, while starting the Must Go Max series. I am only getting into it because of this video. Conan is your BEST guest yet. ❤
I thought he was gonna start pouring it in his eyes
Conan is a really strange person and also a bit disgusting and primitive.
Camera man should’ve followed him to the bathroom the next day
I have to say, the host here did something great: he let the guest, a comedian, be funny, without feeling the need to guide it or try to be funny himself. Something Conan himself was truly an expert at, when he had someone truly funny on. I would theorize that is why he was so complementary of the host. Basically tfhe only breaks from the comedic madness were the compliments.
The baddest
Ngl… have always thought Conan was annoying and yappy… but he gained mad respect from me today.
These panzies can't handle
HES A LEGEND THE GOAT 🐐
Sean, you should look up hot ones Hermitcraft. Tango can and probably would sit with you wing to wing.  Also Conan is crazy AF. lol just sayin ❤️
Like a boss this guy has got to be a boss in the irish Mafia 😅
Best episode yet 👏🏼 love Conan
This is the best hot ones!
Absolutely the best episode 😅 definitely took me by surprise how he handled the hot sauce
Conan us the GOAT...on this show, and in late night talk shows
I wouldn't expect anything less than conan chugging the bottle of hot sauce. What a legend.
been saying it my whole life, Conan is the best showman of our time.
CONAN IS FOR THR PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE HIM
Sounds like Chris Hansen
I’m just glad Sean didn’t mention to Conan to be careful around the eyes. At this point I feel like Conan would’ve put it in his eye 😂😂
Getting actually lost in the sauce
Conan is the GOAT! 🐐.
😂❤️‍🔥
At 14.11 that’s not him it’s a stand in! 😮
It's amazing how this man never fails to deliver the laughs!
I massage his exaggerated voice and performance or whatever the he'll that is
Absolute masterclass.
GET SHANE GILLIS !!!!!!!
Wow, that was boss. I guess that breaks the stereotype that the Irish think ketchup and black pepper are spicy.
Conan Smoked it ! Well done 👍  I personally have done Da Bomb 💣 and you can feel it where your teeth meet your gums and all the way down your throat to your stomach ! You know exactly where it is all the way down ! To drink it straight takes nerves of steel ! I can only imagine the Horror later that evening LOL  Thanks Again 😊
The first one of these where I immediately started it over to rewatch. Conan is an absolute legend. One of my comedy heroes.
Rick Sanchez would be proud
Conan and David Blaine are the true GOATs of this show...
No ones ever been this ballsy 😂😂 makes you really question if the wings are actually that hot
his reaction to da bomb is craaazyyyy
Oscar worthy, he knew we needed this level of comedy 💛🤣
Best Hot Ones guest ever!
Best episode ever!  -The comic book guy
Conan the Barbarian has left the building.
Conan is a Rock Star trapped in a TV talk shows body. Epic!
Conan, the definition of a true Showman, what a great episode this was!
probs one of the best so far!
"Careful around your..." 21:06 "Nevermind."
I'd say Leno needs to get on and follow this up but he's already had a face full of fire so he's probably over it.
The look of concern on Sean’s face after Conan took a shot of the last dab to the dome was too real!
I love this chaotic man!!! Best host....guest ever!! ❤🔥
Conan was a G on this episode.
I’ve been watching for years, NO ONE has ever crushed as hard as Conan! He’s is a category all his own!
I love Conan ❤
One of my favorites. Thank you. So entertained! I love travel shows! Cmon Max make it quick, dying here!   CONAN O’BRIEN took the show! Must watch more Conan! Fabulous!
Classic Conan. The legend
Conan, we love you.  RIP your colon.
Second best late night host of all time, and only because even as good as Conan was, Craig Ferguson was even better.
A Charlie Rose show where you eat hot wings hahaha the best
Love Conan, he is equal to my fav Carson.  Yes, I’m old.  Just anything for a laugh, can’t beat it!❤️
One of my favorites. Thank you. So entertained!
Lidan Al Gaib 👳🏻‍♂️!
I’m a day late! Happy birthday Conan! 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳 (The more birthday emojis the better it is…)
Wow, just wow!  😂
Who clapped at the end?
Coco goes Loco
Conan is king!
Conan is the man. I expected the hot sauce gave him a Popeye face and mutated arms when he left the studio. 😁😁😁
As good as the Henry Rollins episode
If there is any proof that peppers make you high AF this is it.
In related News..... A GoFundMe account has been created by fans of Mr. Conan O'Brien to help said person get a complete transplant of his inner mouth and tongue.  When asked how he injured his inner mouth Conan drooled and said ewoudoiuue8idb.  When that was translated into English, he actually said "get Dr. Arroyo".
The show has peaked. It's officially jumping the shark from here on out. RIP Hot Ones.
Gordon Ramsay + Conan Obrian are the 2 most hyperactive and unhinged personalities in show businesses 😅😅😅.  I feel sorry for Sean in this.
easily the best episode ever made. that was insane. XDDD
This is easily my new favorite hot ones episode. This one beat gordan ramsey in my opinion
Conan is simply the goat. he won the show.
Letterman was great Conan is a God 🙏🏽
Bea Arthur taking strays
Best episode
Conan: I grew up on saltless potatoes... this will be an unmitigated disaster.
LFG CONAN 😂 Hot ones hall of famer
this is the most hilarious episode i’ve ever watched!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I appreciate Conan lifting the veil on the notion that it’s simply hot sauce and then back pedaling in pure improvisational fashion
We Love You, Conan! He has been a Pivotal part of not only the Late Night Landscape but a HUGE influence to many of this generation's Comics & stand-Ups! He has influenced lots of people, in fact, pretty much anyone who is actively funny currently that is worth their salt ALL resolutely cite Conan as a Huge influence!
I’m screaming, why, as he pockets the wings 😂
Conan was foreshadowing Grimes at Coachella at 8:15 🤣
The Goat of late night
There is no better episode than this one. Quit now.
love curtain o"brien!!!!!
I don’t think anyone is going to top this beautiful episode 👏🏼
He is screaming so he wouldn’t cry 😂😂😂 one of the best guests ever
How can any other celebrity after this even come close to Conan on Hot Ones?
WOW, Conan, just WOW.  Best ever Hot Ones.
When he tells Conan to let everyone know what’s going on in his life and milk just comes out of Conan’s mouth 🤣
Legend
shhheshhh fav one so far!
As an Australian, Conan O'Brien is the only talk show host that I respect.
Conan the comedic barbarian. I miss you
The best episode I've ever seen on this channel.  Conan is a living legend.
Truly, there has been no greater madman than Conan.
That was both the funniest and scariest thing I've seen on this show.
I hope this becomes one of the most watched videos of all time
The gretaest episode and onenofnthe greatest comedians, comics, writers and genuinely nice people
The descend into madness is amazing
Late night has been horrible since he left
music ruined it
Was anybody else expecting Conan to melt and then he went god mode?!
Sean didn't follow what the host was doing.
This was one of the most amazing interviews I've ever seen
Did we just witness history? That was just...yeah.
Did Conan put a hex on one of the golden girls?
Best guest yet
Love it but please nix that constant music....
Incredible
Hot ones Grand champion by a mile!!!!!
His face must’ve been on fire .
This is why I love this dude ROTFL
“I never saw a spice until I was about 52 years old” 😂 I love Conan.
My personal hero.
I ❤Conan!!!
2 degrees is no joke
Steve O in the Eye was still better
Oh man.. he probably died like Elvis that night.
Crushed it
😅
Ahh yes, finally a worthy Hot Ones😂
Hands down the best episode ever...
The season 24 opener guest and all season finale guests going forward have such huge shoes to fill. We saw an epic performance. We will comment about this forever. Conan took Hot Ones where no one knew possible.
best one ever!!!!!
I came to the comments to see if anyone else found him as obnoxious and unlikable as I did, but everyone seems to love Conan. I guess this dude is a legend in the eyes of Americans. Maybe the humour just doesn’t translate.
You can’t fall in love, listen and be entertained by Conan. He is funny and smart.  I always remember his speech Dartmouth 2011! Epic!!!!
If you watch Conan Must Go, you'll find out why he built up a tolerance.
Best one yet! Hahaha
Wow best episode ever!!!
Conan O'Brien destroying his colon for comedy.
Conan wins hot ones 🏆
I feel like Conan just shammed every other guest
I love that they did his temperature at the end too lol. I was curious.
best episode yet
You know you've watched Conan for too long when you remember the actor who's Dr. Arroyo as frequent bit characters on Late Night.
"Can I keep these?" Chicken bones go in pocket 😂
Definitely the best episode by far 😂😂😂
When it panned to the sauce spilling all over the table 😂
This hot ones interview is almost as wild as the Michael Cera interview
All time best hot wings ever!!!!!!!!!
You have to get Chilli Klaus and Conan O’Brien together on the same show as a special… It would be amazing.., AND.! RIDICULOUS all at the same time as well..!!!  This was a super fun episode.!
Best show ever
This is the best episode of hot ones. Did not expect it to go this great 😂
This is the greatest thing ever!! 😂😂😂
13:59
🐐!!
goat
Conan is amazing that is the craziest interview lol
God I love the way Sean phrases things, he has such a way with words
I love Conesy ❤️
Conan would be the guy to bring his own skit (with the doctor) into someone else's show. The chaos he brings to the plate is why he'll always be the number one dude.  That being said, I need more episodes of Conan O'Brien Must Go. Four is not enough right now.
Conan started interviewing you XD
conan is just that guy. in all the years ive been watching this show ive never seen a guest absolutely dominate it like this. amazing.
I did not expect be this entertained. Wow, conan is a beast!
13:56 homie didn’t even miss a beat when he took 2 swigs of that hot sauce
Noticed the same thing and agree with Conan. Been watching since either the first or second season and I could tell almost immediately how great of an interviewer you are and how much research you do 👍
There needs to be a Dax Shepard Conan O’Brien hot ones eat off
WOW!
I am beyond impressed
I want to be the first racist black man.........Mr Conan O'Brien, you are the most robust, eccentric intelligent and spiritual white man on planet earth and any galaxy.......ever. My name id Donald.....and I want you to diss me how you want.
He is a beast
💯 the best guest lol
......you cant stop meeeee. My GUY. All day
Conan is amazing! I forget how hilarious he is sometimes.
Conan O'Brien, top top man.
let's protect him like we protect Veder.. please
I dont want to hold my own -  i meant I want to cough and sneeze. I want to soak and pour more pepper source in each hotwings I eat till the end, but i also want a condition that must be met before I eat till the last wing. Last dab soaked up.
Bro this dude 😂
what a huge sacrifice form Conan to the audience. I hope he didnt regret it.
Not sure if anyone can ever top this episode. Hottest one yet
This was     amazing.
Watched Conan (&Andy) since'93 & this was worth the wait.  Conan delivered above&beyond while throwing out TRUTH  kudos to Sean multiple times, *THAT alone was RAD  to watch & hear from a Superhero veteran of so many skills (and experiences with hosts)!!!!  Definitely hit a new level with this episode.  Congrats & many thanks!!
Just legend
Best interview go date
Incredible
21:08 guy was shooketh
I was literally crying of laughter at the end, just amazing, I love him 😂
This is the kind of interview that I'll come back and watch; when the day comes, and we all miss Conan.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 🫶🏽 Conan
I’ll see the thumbnail at times and just give it no second thought but I’m so glad I witnessed this wonder
🤣🤣🙌🙌🙇🏻‍♂️🙇🏻‍♂️
Standing applauses 👏
okey, I have never seen Sean scared about his guest wellbeing before. Conan is fkng wild
Jeeeeeesus!
Bring Elon Musk to the show!!!
Love C O'brien.  Hated to see his nighttime show go.
The best guest yet!  Conan is the epitome of show business🎉🎉🎉
not funny...more like disgusting
Wish list: Harry Mack, Caleb Presley, Tucker Carlson!
I thought he will fold on dabomb but he's insane 😂😂😂
I heard the buzz. This is the rare case where the buzz is exceeded! What a performance! Just magnificent.
😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
SALMON IN THE SEEAAAA
I am who I am.... that was God O'Brian lol
Does Conan know... what he has just done. Genius. Mad Man. What did they give Conan to be able to do this.
3rd time watching, and it keeps getting better.
Conan is scaring me 😅
Conan is amazing!
I always held Gordon Ramsay's Hot Ones interview at the highest level, and I didn't think anyone would top that for me. Conan, though....this guy right here just topped it for me 👏
This has to be the best episode of all time !!!!😂😂
Can we see some more Conan and Andy?
Conan the GOAT of Hot Ones!
If he wasnt sunch a sellout i would like conan
Conan crazy!!!
Conan is always someone who constantly makes me laugh he is so hilarious
Loveeee Conan!! ❤❤❤☘☘☘☘ The entire episode was hilarious! So many great moments including Dr. Arroyo almost strangling Conan to check his pulse while simultaneously getting closer to listen in! Hilarious 😂😂😂😂
STANDING OVATION TO THE BESTEST EPISODE AND THE BESTEST GUEST!! Conan O'brien hit the ball out of the park with his amazing tolerance of heat, his intense but awesome comedy! and for his superb intelligence and intellect!!! Sean and the team of First we feast you guys did it and how!! Thanks for finally bringing this amazing guest!!!!
Going to MAX after this one.
Conan pls. a napkin lol. use a napkin
my mans as orange as trump
Going “Full Conan” should be a new slogan
Officially the best episode.
Lol..1st wing..conan " I feel nothing!" Also conan later while rubbing sauce...all...over.."blllkaaaasggghhhhhhhrrrrrrrrggghhhhrrrbbbljaaagghhh".. Needless too say...that sauce grabbed him by the booboo! 🤣
King of Hot Ones
Conan IS THE Joker from real life
guys I think conan is going through some stuff rn
What an absolute legend.
Wow, Conan you are the goat. I am Indian guy from south Africa. You very funny
Flawless victory!
Ele ficou bem?
Stevo has NOTHING ON THIS GUY
GFD this is how i would expect it to go if  Chris Farley was on!
Credo!!!
Pretty sure this is a Top 5 episode
Redheads have a higher tolerance to pain.
This should be series finally!
And I thought Theo Von and Bobby Lee couldn't be topped.
Best one so far!
he did what he set out to do, this was very entertaining
Love Conan very funny guy loved it when he took his assistant on a ride a long with Kevin Hart and ice cube
I love Conan. Best late night host of all times
Challenge Jordan next!
This will no doubt, go down in history as the best episode of anything ever.
Best episode ever Conan is the GOAT
Best episode 😂😂
Man is a national treasure. Pretty awesome to see the greatest interviewer of his time, being interviewed by a great interviewer of a new generation.
They should also show the aftermaths on the next day.. if you know what I mean..
goat episode
This guy’s really hit the level cap on being annoying.
Dj Khaled, take notes...
Conan is an animal. LOL
Have you heard the song Conan o'brien by Wyatt Longbridge 🔥🔥🔥
Can we please have Grimes or Elon Musk next?
Wow… Wasnt a huge conan fan but this is amazing
Is it just me or does it seem like Conan O'Brien is a mash-up of Elon Musk and Donald trump?😂😂😂
Well must go is a must watch now.  After that heroic performance
Best guest EVER!!!!
✨A WISE AND STABLE MAN✨
This...... was pure pleasure
Conan is not human  He is God
that was hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely insane and amazing at the same time! I feel humble right now. Respects! ❤
Have Melissa Stratton on
God I love Conan. Might be the best episode of Hot Ones
I'm feeling that the "putting the bones in his pocket"-bit was the buildup to a punchline that never happened
Conan has never come closer to being a GTA radio character, and that's something I've thought previously multiple times
I havent seen many episodes of this show, but i think this is the best one.
This was easily the best interview ever on hot ones.
He did this entirely for that room only, thankfully the cameras were on.
By far my favorite episode thus far. What a phenomenal entertainer.
This episode was funny 😂😂
"You say this is pure pepper?" while devouring it hahaha
Pure legend…
Conan is one of the most charadmatic humans ever
Conan : perhaps the best talk show host…
Never in my life would i think i'd hear Conan O'Brien doing a Ric Flair woo 😂
Conan! Nooooooooo! 🤣😂
What’s wrong w me?! Why can’t I feel?! I felt that Conan….. I felt that….
Oh my god
I feel like 99/100 times people who act like Conan in real life are annoying but there is just a certain charm to Conan
I’m 70% sure Conan was on coke this whole interview😂
22:54
Now we need Conan and Katt Williams together, or is the world even ready???!!!
Dr Aroyyo bits is just too funny
Also, you gotta love the lore on dr Arroyo. He went to college out of state, for what was supposed to be 4 years ¿?, takes your pulse from behind with both hands, and has an office in the desert. He's a breaking bad character.
So...I binged watched this series again...and I have to say, this is by far the greatest episode ever. Lots of greats, but this one...is truly legendary.
🤔 is it strange i legitimately feel concerned feel concerned about Conan's sphincter? He better wipe wirh wet leaves cause he'd start fire with toilet paper
That was fantastic but I wonder if Conan actually regretted that. 😂
Best episode to date.
This is the best episode ever,  Conan the Barbarian is amazing he is the man
Hilarious.
that's what we call LORD
Man I rly miss late night with him hahahah🤣🤣
Best episode ❤
This was so great!
Perfect... this was fun to watch!!
conan is real GIGACHAD :))))
God, I was crying laughing by the end of that.
the best one love it
Beat that...anyone just beat that! 😂 such a hilarious & memorable episode!
This is  probably the funniest episode yet
you just have to love Conan
That's it. This is THE greatest Hot Ones. Love you Coney
I wish he would still write for The Simpsons. 🥲
That man is an absolute lunatic. I feel bad for his guts.
I love how QUICKLY IT ESCALATES IN TRUE Conan fashion 😂
Best one yet!
God help him when he takes a dump after this.
Take your flowers, Conan 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I’m a Conan fan now! This was too funny! 😂
i will forever love Conan.
Conan is an Irish legend
Legend
The social distancing table is the worst thing I've seen.
One of the very best episodes. Right up there with Paul Rudd 🔥
Best one ever!! Wow LOL
I mean, my gosh, Conan literally nailed it. Now I’m sad that I can’t get more of his charisma and intelligence. Just added his show on “Max.” 😂 The man is brilliant and a master of his craft. I’ve started looking into his other interviews for fun, and as a PhD, I will add that he does a fantastic job of not making unsubstantiated statements. I’m thoroughly impressed with Conan.
Gingers sure are a different breed
"I am not fit for this office and never should have been here." - Warren G. Harding  At least Harding was man enough to admit it, unlike Trump
Conan is awesome, what a class act
I doubt other late night hosts would handle masterfully like Conan. Man is a writer/improv comic genius who so commits to his "showmanness".
Craig Ferguson nxt Plzzzzzz
This was the greatest episode of all time.
20:47 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 “CALL THE WIFE!!!” lol
This is conan the legend 😂 my only favourite american host
My god Conan, I mean hats off for your dedication
"THIS IS TO YOU!! CALL THE WIFE!!!"
Watching this I zone in and out staring at Conan's awful hair, it's hypnotizing! 🎉😮🎉
conan rocks !!! from all the guest he would be the most memorable gosh !!! he really went berserk with those sauces even on the nips lol,,this is how you do it !!
Best. Guest. Ever.
ok I gotta say that is one of the top 3 episodes
YAY! CONAN! FINALLY!
The double-take Conan did at Dr. Arroyo at 13:40 killed me.
Best episode ever😂😂😂😂
Best episode ever.
Lisan al Gaib
Da bomb is the worst tasting hot sauce I have ever tried
He took off in the first half we lost him in the 2nd 😂
24:57 and on... I don't think I'm going to be able to sleep tonight
Birds and Lizards cant taste Hot peppers. Proof Conan is a Bird Person.
Are we doing this or not?!?!?! WHAT'S THE POINT OF LIVING?!? I love you Conan
Best episode I’ve ever watched
This is the way Ice Spice's interview should've gone
🫡 to the legend Conan, the man "gets it" has understood entertainment / comedy for decades and still works harder than most people less than half his age
This has to be one of the best interviews I’ve seen. Conan just doesn’t care how he looks. Brilliant.
Absolutely hilarious!!!!
The only Irishman to get melanoma from hot sauce.
BEST GUEST EVER!!!!!!!! 🧡🧡🧡
Well now I wanna do coke with Conan O Brien
Was never a huge fan of his show, but really enjoyed this.
Can you get Jeff Goldblum to try the show again?
First time watching this show, I read about Conan O'Brien's interview and just had to watch it. Intense and entertaining. Good show!
Is it just me or after the last dab, it was sheer terror on Sean's face? 🤣
Conan is a MONSTER!
If you pay attention to the videos of the past and the other guys sauce, conans is clearly diluted, come on guys. It's so obvious
I had an actual physical reaction when he sauced Da Bomb!!!! Never seen a guest take it like that!
They went easy on Conan I'm sure. he only agreed to do the show if they made him look tougher than other guests. More than half way through and no spice? Even people that like and are use to hot food are feeling it by then. Obvious they rigged it for him, I don't buy it, he is funny though
Greatest hot ones ever
This guy is about as funny as his hair. Lost me at minute three.  Thank God he is (almost) gone.
If there is a Mount Rushmore of Hot Ones.... CONAN IS GEORGE WASHINGTON
I love the inspirational music while Conan loses his mind at the end. Unhinged.
Love Conan. Hilarious pro
Conan's FAF! The perfect finale guest!
This is their best episode. All thanks to Conan, he's carring the entire interview, like he always does.
I LOVE Conan... The GREATEST guest on this show EVER.
HOLY CRUD..... CONAN NAILING THAT (DA BOMB) WAS INSANE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I feel Conan should have a lot more love and notoriety than he does
Calling it a Charlie Rose show was so spot on, if I had milk it would have been on my keyboard.....
I feel the same way about hot food as Conan does.   No effect lol
Anyone have a link to this water buffalo footage? … Also this man is ruining his beautiful jacket with these wings 🍗
I was supposed to do other things but whenever i see conan, i watch. I Love this man definitely one of the greatest comedian ever
glad that potentially new people are being exposed to the genius of Conan.
This was amazing and hilarious
Best episode ever...genius!
Insane 😵🔥🔥🔥
This is iconic
god tier
This is a legendary performance 😅
Chaos and madness was gradually turbocharged in Conan by spicy spices.
"There needs to be a fireworks display to close this out." OH there will be when Conan hit the toilet later.
GRAZY!! 😂😂😂
Man his A hole must have looked like he'd been at a Diddy party after this....
Charlie Rose meets hot wings Lol
I miss old the Conan show where he would pull a level and play random bits of Walker Texas Ranger 😂
I love the HDTV generation. Everyone looks like human beings instead of mannequins. I join you in wrinkly eye solidarity, Conan! Crow's feet for victory!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My introduction to Conan was in the very early 2000's on AOL. You could change the "you've got mail" to celebrity voices. I remember having no idea who Conan was, but his AOL setting said "you've got pink eye!" I absolutely hated it! Lol!!  What an absolute beast! He destroyed those wings!!
This is the best episode so far as expected
I am laughing so hard at this doctor guy 😂😂
100% respect Conan!
Best. Hot Ones. Ever.
Is the Conan must go show only available for the US? Because it still not on my Max when I search for it and it was supposedly out yesterday
I never thought an Irish dude would be the champion in  this.   Not in a million years.
He's so unfunny. The doctor bit was painful
this is the reason why I love Conan so much e
One of the best
There will never be anyone like you Conan
😂😂😂 Love you Conan
This is the best episode of Hot Ones to date. I would expect nothing less from one of the funniest people on the planet.
Da bomb gets everyone, even Conan
Conan Jesus Christ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂this man is a true legend 😂
now, that is A chilihead :)
This is the most unhinged episode so far and I'm here for it lol
This brings me tears. Thank you Conan for being such a great person, a great reader, a great professional, a great healing comedian.
Proof that Conan becomes the main character wherever he goes.
What an insane show finale :)   COnan never dissapoints
Man that was a very stylish jacket Conan had on...
I had to have some milk after watching
Best interview ever on First We Feast history. My god what a showman.
With each Conan craziness all I could think of was water buffalo! Entire episode was one big water buffalo. Lol
Was that a reference to when Conan produced the Simpsons?!?! The song about the mediocre presidents!! 🤣
Props to Conan for battling through them hot ones 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
His physician needs a physician😭😂
❤❤❤
This is it. The greatest hot ones episode ever. Its not even close, Conan is ine of a kind
Conan is one in a billion, no question
The best words of wisdom at the end.
Is this the born of the Joker?
Lol
Conan the Barbarian 😂😂
U know what i have realize age doesnt bring u wisdom it brings u nunbness😂😂😂😂😂
Embryonic Rock-a-billy Polka Dotted Fighter Pilots
legend!
+1
Man much respect for Conan
Ok, this officially beats out Gordon Ramsey for most obnoxious guest ever!😂😂😂
That was legendary! 😂😂😂
Conan is great.  No pun(jabi) intended.
Conebone ❤️❤️❤️❤️
AJAJAJAJAJAHAHAHAHA THIS GUY IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST. #1
the spit is giving king george III from hamilton
It's Not a Bit,It's Conan!
Conan gained you a subscriber
Outstanding.
This has to be the greatest piece of Internet content to be ever created.
Man, I've had da bomb and literally put some on the corner of a tortilla chip and my teeth hurt so bad and it felt like my tongue was gonna explode. Rough stuff, Conan is gonna be feeling this for the next week!
OK this is YouTube history
Was that Cosmo Kramer yelling at the end?
"Call the wife!" Too dang funny man
It's called covid.....
How?  How is he able to do it?  He didn't stumble once.  He's in extreme discomfort and he just keeps going.  He was just drinking the hot sauces lol.   I honestly haven't laughed this hard in a really long time.
Conan is the hot ones GOAT
He took "commit to the bit" to its furthest possible conclusion. The obsessive need for comedy literally helped him to survive to the end.
Remember how Homer dodged the spice in Chief Wiggums Chilli? Thats how Conan did it. Probably meeting the coyote right now.
He owned this episode! Hats off to you Sir!
I need to go to bed but I'll stay up for anything with Conan that I haven't seen. He's a classic!
7.7m 7 days ago
He had to put that dam wing in his pocket  😂
Leftists should not eat spicey food, it will make them cry, then he will strain some dumpster pudding thru his cotton backstops.
Conan is a savage
Conan’s the 🐐
Dude went BATSHIT!!!!😂😂😂😂😂
the most self aware mf alive
Conan is the most overrated person alive. A boiled egg is more fun.
Conans Comedy will FOREVER be UNMATCHED!
Love Conan. Love hot ones 😍😜
Iam gonna be scared of Conan when hes turning into a zombie in a zombie apocalypse movie bro gonna be a calamity type
Conan was amazing. But I can’t find any references to support the Warren G. Harding lobster claim?
Cried tears to this one! Simply brilliant and it´s impossible how Conan handles this Sauces. Got da Bomb and Apollo here and can only go with a tiny, tiny drop of those...HE DRANK THE MFin´ PEPPER X SAUCE. Ma gaaawd!
"So this...this is the Last Dab Experience"  No, Sean, this is clearly the Conan Experience
He made it Conan O Brian's show. One of the best host and comic for a reason 🙂
Disgusting
YESSSS
This was an incredible episode, one of the best I've seen! I haven't laughed like this in weeks, despite being SO AFRAID for Conan's life. What a great way to end the season!
fabulous. great finale! <3
Conan doesn’t take over the show…HE IS THE SHOW🥳
He has that so danger irish look in his eyes. Yes. I see that. Don't mess with Connan thr Barbarian. ;)
This show is like JRE on steroids
Never has a plug worked so well on me before. I finished watching this, looked at the calendar, and IMMEDIATELY started watching Conan O'Brian Must Go instead of Wings of Hope, the Werner Herzog doc I forgot I planned to watch tonight. Amazing.
I bet Conan just swallowed wax before the interview. I mean, after all he wrote for the Simpson
having Da Bomb i cant imagine how bad that must've been
Dude is f*ckin’ silly lol, I love it. He’s hilarious for no reason throughout
For me, Whatever they say Conan is the king of Late Night Talkshow.
Conan has got to be the most insufferable person. Not as bad as james corden but still makes me want to kermit the frog everytime I hear his voice
When Conan said him and the water Buffalo made amends, did the Buffalo get put down? 😂
Conan is a legend!
Is there a specific hospital where we could send cards wishing Conan a swift recovery?
"Call the wife!"
Genre defining.
happy birthday Conan
What does Conan mean by "call the wife"? Is this some idiom? Call the wife for?
I appreciate Conan, what a guy
Conan is a animal  ! lol lol lol
😮😮😂😂 Respect
What a guy
Love Coco!
A classic. I feel like Conan would make the perfect Taskmaster if they were to ever try relaunching it in the US!:)
Anybody else notice that little dig at Leno in the beginning? "The other guy".
I hope this one the top five if not the top interviews of all time. He was better than David Blane. So much emotion when it was needed. 👍🏼👍🏼
Conan slid in with the best one ever
I love this show but those last four minutes are the first time I've laughed out loud uncontrollably
With time ive come to the conclusion that i think conan is one of the greats..
It is COMLETELY PATHETIC HOW CONAN O'BRIEN WILL ABSOLUTELY STRAIN TO GET A LAUGH and how pathetic he is at being funny
Conan DEFINITELY payed for this one 🚽
All I gotta say is “ JESUS!!! THAT WAS ONE HELLUVA SHOW!!! “
Respect for Conan! This was amazing!
This is what losing your marbles looks like xD
💯%PROOF 🐐🐐🐐
I rarely laugh out loud. This one broke me
One of the best if not the best episode of Hot Ones
This was the best!! 😂❤
I hate Conan so much. I do like that he gave real answers though
Conan actually did so well on the wings I mean a lot of other guests had to really stop what they were doing but he kept going hahahaha
EPIC! 😂
I think Hot Ones should retire after this. No one will ever top this. If anyone tries to, they'll end up dead and Sean will end up in prison.
IRISH CATHOLIC 😳😳😳 my man is playing on legendary.
The dc(person doesn't matter who) enter the room & acknowledge the other person as well by saying hello, & Conan says: u don't have to talk to him, just to me. The end for me.
finally you brought some one more spicy than the Hot One's sauce
conan's the craziest guest ever I love it hahahaha
I was totally expecting his crescendo but those running gags and speech at the end was pure Conan Gold
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 he took over show lol
I've literally been chuckling at the memory of this for almost a week
THIS JUST IN: Conan Obrian found dead in his hotel room after overdosing on Capsaicin
Woww
this derailed fast
I've been watching this show for years. The guests often suggest this - the secret ingredient to the hot sauce is Sean. Excellent questions that guests have heard for the first time. Great show!
Last couple sauces, I'd  be praying on the bog but love chilli n peppers even tho I got IBS
Nobody will ever top this. Best part of the whole video is how offended Conan gets when Sean calls the way he acts a bit lol
Hahahahahahahahahalolololololololololhahahahaha!!! He’s way too much!!!
He impressed me. funny guy.
Conan is impressive in the way that he lives his life all or nothing. He's an icon.
Conan O’Brien. The most universally loved celebrity of his time. I’m happy to see him.
always remember that conan is an b**** irl
Conin has long covid bless his heart
i don't know why people think this guy is funny, he is just nasty and disgusting!! no way near comedy!!
All the moments are my favorite ! Caliente
Just here for my weekly viewing of this legendary video.
I think Conan beats Ramsey as best guest lol
We have a champ🎉
Conan is the goat...no one comes close
This is awesome!!! Conan is American treasure!!! ❤😂❤
Conan looks like Biden?
BEST SHOW EVER. LOVE CONAN. These young generations just don't make people like him anymore. Just weirdo's doing tiktok dances and singing rap that sounds like it was written by a 5 year old.
Conan wins. Champ
that was the best one. you hit the mountain top and then shot a rocket to space on top of it.
How tall is he, he's huge😮
This is the GOAT people. We are witnessing greatness! Drink it in.
This man wrote the funniest episodes of the Simpsons during it's Golden Age. This is a sacred video
Having had Da Bomb .. many times. I am in awe of this ranga's resilience .. Well done Conan! 👏👏👏 What a legend!
Dominated. Possibly the best ever.
Conan aged gracefully, doesn't look a day over 70.
Conan looks like the blonde thumbs-up character from Fallout!
LOL Well done Conan.
My favorite firstwefeast episode ever and absolutely no surprise...
Conan came off nearly as insane as Dennis Hopper's Frank from the film Blue Velvet. Nearly as insane and cool a/f.
One of the greatest
Pls bring dr disrespect to the show..😅
I need the Conan O'Brien "Oh Yeah" as a ring tone.
Best episode yet
Power over spice is power over all
A stellar moment. Conan is one step closer to comedy godliness.
No one can touch this level of commitment.  Just swiggin the bottles and pocketing wings...this is the benchmark episode of the series and is the standard with which all should strive to equal.  You got Conan vs Weird Al's approach...you see why Conan reached the level of success he has....full fkn send.
“Call the wife!” 😂
BEST EVER!!!
Happy birthday, Coco.
I never knew how crazy this man was 😂😂😂
The king. This is the peak.
I think this is the only time I have laughed so much on this show. Conan is just a legend!
Best guest EVER! The guy who interviews the stars happens to be "the best guest"
I was honestly concerned for his safety. I think Sean was too.
<LEGEND>
DJ Khalid take notes bro 😂
Dr. Arroyo needs a daytime show.
I'm in tears from laughing. Love Conan so much!
Imagine the trips to the toilet he had after doing this, I don't think people realize how hot these sauces actually are, this should go in a record book, then there's me who can barely handle Medium salsa 😂 you can SEE his blood pressure through his face 😂 this can be dangerous af but my guy did it like a true legend!
The icon himself. What a great episode
Conan is BRILLIANT!
Best espisode ever!!😂
I was scared that he was going to have a great attack while describing nickson
I’m worried about him 😂 مجنووون
If Conan does hot ones again, There's no way he can top this ep, unless ofc he brings jordan or the chill chums along in the next guesting
Absolutely epic, one of the funniest episodes
Best Host on NBC ever
Conan has 0 social anxiety ❌ social has a Conan anxiety ✅
Lisan al Gaib 🙏
This first started like an interview of a US presidential candidate .. ended like he was the Joker devouring the cameraman and produces 😂
😂🤣😂 Conan DID NOT Disappoint.
Has anyone seen Conan O'brien must go? I can't wait to watch it. Been waiting for years for his remotes!
Those wings are dry, right?
beautiful
What a legend, I miss clueless gamer
I feel sick. 😂
I'm just happy to see this have 7.6 million views. Conan getting all the love he deserves.
How the f he managed to do this.
He is more relevant now than ever now, fatty respect homie is gnarly!
Conan killed it. I laughed out loud a few times
Too bad Andy The Swedish German couldn't have been there for moral support .
Best episode ever!
Absolute. Fxxking. Legend. 😂
bruh
Wow
In pretty much every cooking segment on Conanʻs shows, he made that Three Stooges sound. It is only now that I know where that sound comes from.
This might be the best episode ever. 😂😂😂
Conan now hold the belt!! Give him the belt b4 I tell him you are hiding it!!
The man is an ANIMAL… absolute BEAST 😨😭🤣
That...was...amazing
For the first time, it was not the brilliant interview questions. It was all Conan. He is just the f*@&ing GOAT! You invite him to your talk show, he will own it, but in the nicest, sweetest and funniest way ever.
OK so he's in the running for Hot Ones Deathmatch whenever that happens.
Conan's amazing. Hilarious AF
jim carry should make a good guest
Best episode ever!!!  Conan rules!
best hot ones ever
CALL THE WIFE!!!!!!
You are my A#1 hero. 😅
That's why he's my goat 🔥
I knew from the second I saw that Conan was the guest this was going to be epic but I had NO IDEA it was going to be this epic.
Wow that was just brilliant. Absolute legend
What a beast
Last dab? Dude had already POURED every sauce on every wing and chugged several straight from the bottle. The last dab lost its grandeur forever
LOVE CONAN
Over the top - Conan can be a funny guy but this was hard to watch. Not necessary to try to put on a show and entertain the in studio employees. Yes, three stooges if they were 60+ years old and rolled into one. ~ embarrassing ~
Well you shouldn't have grunted like a predator and lunged into its side that I figure you had it coming Mr. O'Brien.
When someone with actual talent and skills comes on the show
What an episode!!
holy crud idk if I fear how much I love him or love how much I fear him but Conan got after it 😮
I AM NOT A CONAN FAN!!!!!  I absolutely can not stand him. His jokes, his political views, and everything about who he is. He is the complete opposite of me. However, this is my favorite episode of hot ones and I’ve seen them all. Conan, you nailed this and I’m man enough to give credit where credit is due. Sean and Conan, guys you nailed it. Best episode ever. 👏
Da bomb is supposed to be hot, but Conan goes at it like it's nothing. This man isn't human he is superhuman.
Happy April 18th to everyone
Why do I feel like this is a break through and break down 😂
Legend
I know I'm late but I've never clicked a Hot Ones video so fast when I saw Conan's face
his greatest work without a doubt was on the simpsons. its not even close. hes a mediocre interviewer, hilarious guest, amazing writer.  so great
Glad Da Bomb stays on the lineup just to throw off even the great Conan lol
how do you keep doing the show knowing nothing will ever top this.
He turned into Cris Farley @21:00 😂
Conan is the GOAT... Unhinged, but the GOAT nevertheless. this was the single greatest episode ever
you just feel for the pulse "it's there"
I'm watching this at work, in a busy office and everyone is wondering why I'm laughing!
I've seen maybe 60-70 of these episodes, there have been some amazing ones but this is certainly the funniest - good form Conan
Definitelyy favorite episode ever .
Gold
What a piece of over acting. I don’t understand people fawning over this as some kind of comedy genius. One of the worst guests/episodes of Hot Ones ever.
The greatest interview of all time.
Torille
protection, engaged.
I FOOKIN LOVE CONAN!!! GOAT LATE NIGHT HOST!! THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER!!
22:38 his face i can't😂💀
Greatest episode ever! What a legend. 😂😂😂
LEGEND
Love the show but this is a complete fake. He got everyone on this one- that I mean Conan still great material none the less. I would call this episode Conan feast on 1stWeFeast to get plugs for Max. With an EGO that big and big pockets of cash if I had a show I might oblige as well to humor him anyways.
*Cuts to Conan bloodshot and wild*      I’M FINE      😂😂😂
The good ol chicken pocket
gotta love how Conan turned this whole episode into a sketch.
20:41 No, just a happy accident.
How u didn't touch your eyes was a miracle!  you did great Conan!  But i was scared for ur eyes!!!
Conan is a beast😭
He is amazing!!! i love this one the most
Somehow Conan started with the firm “know less” joke about his show, then Sean references that joke (I think), and YET I am always so happy to know more about Conan. What a treat.
Whats the background music near the end
The best so far..laughing from start to finish 😅
When he popped the top on the Bomb I audibly gasped, thinking he was gonna drink it and then die and we'd be minus a legend
Two minutes and thirty seconds in and I know this is gonna be unhinged... Seven forty-five: "Just choke me a little bit." - Anthony Padilla Sixteen fifty ... He's gone fully mental. Never go fully mental  And finally twenty-two twenty-five... he's going to regret that in about 3 hours...lololol
Conan killed it!!!!!!!!!
26:19 😂
Conan is the last bastion for hope.
Oh man! I love Conan. He had the best late night show. Got me through my growing years in the late 90s and all the way until he retired in 2021. Love his podcast too. Cant wait to see his knew show. 😀
Conan OBrien is the Boss! You two are the best ever. Congrats from Mexico.
This was the best ep EVER
Wow!
What a softie, not like the original hot sauce master DJ Khaled. Now THAT GUY could really handle his hot sauce
Conan is just a rockstar!!!
One things for sure.. Conan is unapologetically Conan and I've always loved him for it. Bravo as usual.
today I learned I was born the same day as Connor. Nice
Amazing!!
Super crazy funny at the end 😂😂😂😂xoxo
Conan is the best! Legend!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just don't care for Conan.
Telling Bey Author that "she got four years to live tops" 🤣🤣🤣xoxo
Conan the barbarian❤❤❤
Conan is a national treasure
All I can think of is the guy who quit halfway through claiming he wasn’t quitting
PURE BOSS, Absolutly the KING and best guest ever in Hot Wings... No equal... Old School commitment... The SHOW never stops!
Lol, Lol, Lol
CONAN is the funniest First We Feast guest ever Bringing his personal doctor is comedy genius🤠👍👍💥
if he would have given the last wing to his doctor that would have been illarious
Goat talk show my fav
Wow!
16:55 is all of Conan's pent up frustration from being asked to do the show all these years.
Honestly this is the most epic show ever hahaha
Epic
Best episode ever. lol
savage AF.
The best interview I’ve ever seen. What legends
White red head Irish man destroyed eating hot sauce. Mexicans and Asians watch the Irish
Savage
Hands down best episode to date.
Literally insane in the best way possible. He's the same age as my mom... Can't even imagine her being so lively and full of humour while eating some of the spiciest hot sauce known to man, like WOW! Conan bravo!
I think Conan needs some help, guys. I have had hot sauce on my hands and it burned for days. I refused to touch my newborn for nearly a week.
👏👏👏👏👏👏WOW! Conan is naturally entertaining. Been watching Late Night for years. This is by far the best episode of Hot Ones 👑
Just watched this April 18th, 2024. Happy Birthday Conan🎉❤💯🥳
Why are they spread apart so far??
This is one of my favorites ever
I will always Love Conan, this makes me love him even more😂😂
They don’t make men like this no more. Now they just whine and be scared to go the extra mile
God tier
Conan is a Legend
WHAT THE
Legend 😂
BEST HOT ONES EPISODE EVER!!!! Thank you Conan 😂
“You’re not a doctor, are you?”  “I should be.”  💀
not even close. Best episode ever!
That was awesome!! He man handled those wings. That's my dog!!
Loved the three stooge bit
great interview…but Hot ones OG this looks weird the only first bite shot of a wing is the first and the cut to every wing after that it’s to a cut up wing and is using the jacket bit to flash the staged wing? he never takes an actual bite after the first wing or am i trippin?
Ok, don’t care, best episode ever! Somehow, this is exactly what I expected and yet not at all what I expected simultaneously.  Amazing performance from Conan and brilliant job of hanging on for dear life by Sean! Lol
This might never be topped 😂
I think this might be my new favorite episode
Man u make me laugh untill I cry 😅😅😅😅😅😅
Legendary!
My god. There will never be another Conan!!! Hahhahahaha he’s the greatest!!!
Sean Evans: "Yeah I run an internet talk show where we eat hot chicken wings." Conan: "So it is a challenge, then."
21:10😂
“Smokey J” 😂 I NEEEEED THAT!! My nicknames are literally “Smokey” and “Jeh” 😂😂🔥 I neeed thisssss
God conan is so naturally funny
Happy Birthday, Conan!
WHY CAN'T I FEEL?
CALL THE WIFE!!!!
The best
I think this has to be the best episode ever. Conan is a legend. Always funny.
37 years old and finally a Conan fan 😂
I've been watching Coco since 2007. This man shaped my humor, has never let me down and has given me so much great life advice. When I feel down I watch Conan on Youtube.  This man singlehandedly gives the anti-depressant market a run for their money.   Thanks Conan. There was talk of gerbils.
Why does Sean start off looking like an anime character in this one?
I've watched them all, this was 100% one of a kind! Another level of commitment, Conan is simply an amazing human!
wow.... just wow
That is a nice jacket
Brilliant
Watching this on April 18th... Happy Birthday Conan!
This might be the greatest episode ever
He doesn’t even say jay lenos name. Sad.
Why don’t we see Sean eat?
Best. Episode. Ever! I love this!
I'm surprised that Sean even has a digestive tract left after all these FWF videos.
Great episode! Maniac 😂😂😂
Happy birthday today April 18 2024
I actually started sweating on my brow, and under my eyes when he drank the last sauce.. 🥵
Conan is aging like fine wine. I'd place him in the same category as Chris Hansen, Will Smith, Winona Ryder, and Keanu Reeves.
Will forever be "I'm with Coco".
This has got to be one of the greatest hot ones yet. Conan a goat
I admire the courage, but he’s trying too hard
First time watching a full episode. Ina long time.
Ive been a fan of Conan from the mid 90s when I was a teen watching his late night. Great to see him still passionate about his craft.
I think Dave Grohl will always be my favorite episode, but this is a close 2nd.
Happy birthday Conan :)
Not a single dull moment in whole episode what a legend conan is. Best episode of any show ever
Conan might have the greatest comedic timing of all time. The man is a true genius.
I dont even watch hot ones much or conan show, but I knew this would be gold.
I lost my mind every time he put the wing at the pocket cuz is just dumb comedy and im here for it The bomb broke ppl but conan? He just a bit bended hahahahahah
Too much
i’m watching on april 18th. hbd conan!
2:15 This is some Matthew-McConaughey-Wolf-of-Wall-Street-Level of Philosophicalness🤣
Dr. Arroyo sneaky MVP of this
Conan O’Brien is the single greatest human being in the history of the world.
He so weird
He may not feel it going in but good lord is he gonna feel it coming out.
Legit may be the BEST EVER
Legend
R.E.S.P.E.C.T.
Jay Leno would never do this 👎👎
I think he completely had Sean off balance, which is great.  Usually he is so calm and cool while the celebrity slowly unravels.  This was fun.
Hey we share a birthday. 🎉
King
Didn't enjoy these episode, Conan was too "On". Just chill out and be a normal person. That's why we watch the show.
what an EPISODE! Conan has energy fr
GOAT!
"The other guy I don't know what he was doing" firing shots at Jay Leno - take that. Team Coco!
Okay... I've never seen an episode like this!
I never knew this show could be won
probably my favorite since Ramsey
Affordable Doctor...... 🤣
Conan does. Not. Miss.
I've watched this one 3 times. It's my favorite so far,  Conan's shows were special to me and this was hilarious.
KING.
Best interview by far!!!!
"This one, I'm not going to lie, I'm feeling a little bit."😆
HBD, CO'B
I've watched a good amount of these always saying that was his best interview, I'm done finding the best now this is the GOAT I'm crying laughing so hard.
Conan getting more views that Sydney sweeny is insane. Truly still one of the greatest
Happy birthday Conan!🎉
ok I must admit I've seen so many great Hot Ones episodes but I've never laughed so much before. Conan had me in stitches!
God bless Conan he is still so funny
this is Nathan fielder level trickery
Conan is a beast!!!wow master G. That was great!!!
What drugs is he on?............I want some lol
I think im going to subscribe to MAX now, because of Conan😂😂😂😂
I love him
Conan is an international treasure.
F*CKING LEGEND
What an animal! I'm seriously impressed
That “I’m not gonna lie, I’m feeling this one” moment after Da Bomb is the hardest I’ve ever laughed watching this show 😂😂 his resolve was so strong until the realization of what he had just done by pouring that sauce all over that wing. Conan is freaking hilarious 😂
Team Coco is a separate world.
AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! CONAN IS THE GOAT YO!
Conan man. Legendary
Conan!!!
When his speech  finished I felt SO proud and obliged to clap for him. I was clapping alone in my room at 3 am.  🥲 tears of joy , man.
It's really amazing because obviously Conan came in prepared, with a bit, but at some point he realizes the bit is just him vs sauce. A true comedy professional. Follow the bit.
You just got complimented by Conan O'Brien on your interview style. Retire now. Uninstall the internet. XD
Whats wrong with me?! why cant i feel?!?!   LOVE YA CONAN!!!
Coke.
The guy is insane 😂😂
Conan took this to another level.... This is like a stand up special
"I like to announce my mistakes up front" 💀😂
I’m so excited to watch his travel show. I still laugh like a crazy person every time I watch the bit in Germany with him, Andy and the Bavarian dancing sons and Father. It is just pure dopamine hit right into my soul.
How to be a professional in the business. Wow!
Well that was absolutely ridiculous. And I wouldn't expect anything different from Conan. I've watched him since he 1st started back in the early 90s
BRILL, added to my top 5
You're not a doctor are you. " No, I should be " lolz😂
I don't think anyone will debate that this is a Top 5 show. It's #1 for me. I know we were all waiting for Da'Bomb. Who also yelled "noooooo, don't do it" at the screen?
😂😂😂😂😂 this was just next level unhinged and yet wisdom was espoused too. What a juxtaposition.
22:35 the sheer terror on Sean’s face is palpable 😂🤣😂
Savage! Not many Irishmen could pull that off.
Devil in disguise
How do you top this episode? 🤣
This one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. Truly epic.  What's up with the cringe guy at the end holding a hockey stick like a baseball bat?
I screamed "DON'T DO IT CONAN" for the last 3 wings 🤣🤣
Perfect episode.
Happy Birthday Conan! The only tv host I’ve ever liked!
Conan legend
A week later and still #5 trending! Conan is the goat!
IDK IF ANYONE ELSE IS TOPPING THIS EPISODE !!
oh I never noticed the Buzzfeed on it... that is sad...
Channeling Lewis Black at the end.
Good luck to whoever has to follow this up.
Is this Conan's audition to be Joker in a forthcoming Batman film or series? If so, please make it happen!
this might be the best interview yet... two amazing interviewers knowing what the audience wants! loved every second of it!
My respect to Conan. Just amazing
You'll love Sera and Nyktos's chemistry. I hope you stick around to the series till then!!
Watched nearly every single episode since it’s inception, and Conan understood the assignment more than any other guest
I agree 100% with Conan, Sean is an incredible interviewer.
I am cackling hahahah, he did really nail the plug cuz is a pro!!
Conan needs a show the best of so few
King Conan🍗🔥
Homerun!! CONAN is the BEST
Here's a host with decades of experience just absolutely taking over the show lol
Wow what a treat this was! Best episode ever 😂
Been watching him sense 6th grade 😂I’m 32 love it
Conan is just one of those kind of people. I bet he is amazing to be around. He never fails to put a smile on my face.
O boy he went full conan on this 1 😂
22:30 when the LSD is coming on.
Do matpat pleaseeeeee
I would have thought Cinemax would get the knives out when HBO drops their hog on the table and says 'Yeah, now we're calling ourselves Max'. Seriously surprised there wasn't a trademark lawsuit. Also, I was legitimately clapping and had tears in my eyes with Conans outro.
Best episode ever
“It’s not a bit. It’s life.” is fantastic quote
First time in a long time that I actually enjoyed every minute of this show
Conan was amazing but what is up with Sean, why did he look so different to me?
20:56 peak of american humor
The running bits throughout 😭 Dr. Arroyo needs a raise
This is it. I almost want to send this to people who have never watched the show before but it’ll leave them dissapponted knowing this is THE best episode
Amazing!
18:00 not Reagan????? WHAAT? His jokes were fantastic
Amazing!
Conan is the Wing Gretzky of Hot Ones
This was by far the best episode of this show😂😂
God I love Conan this was fantastic miss the old Conan and Norm days those were priceless pieces of television glad they’ve mad their way back via YouTube
I wish I could like this twice
Ladies and Gentlemen, CONAN! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Happy birthday bub
I have not laughed out load in a long long time like this. I love you Conon.
Best Hot Ones episode EVER.
Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve just witnessed history. Greatest guest in all of Hot ones, round of applause for this stellar entertainer.
Absolute legend
"In the words of my hero, Popeye". :V  Conan never disappoints. 👌
7:48 palpation of both A. carotis communis, very smart...
NOBODY HAS OR WILL DO IT BETTER THAN CONAN. So proud of him!!!!
Psalms 119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.
Now that was the best one ever!!!!
Sorry, this is ridiculous. I prefer something more real and less performative.
Goat episode xD Conan IS the man
Conan looking at the beyond with his baby-blues seeing God whilst hallucinating on hot sauce, drooling and babbling. Amazing.
"I DON'T FEAR YOUR WINGS''  - Conan .B
Holy smokes! I had a toothpick of DaBomb and my mouth shot flames. Conan, there's something wrong with you. HHhahah!
Sean has been doing this for how long and still looks so happy to do the interviews  Love it
"WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME, WHY CAN'T I FEEL?!" relatable
Bro that was a funny AF Episode and im German we dont laught its canon
Katt Williams
This man's hair swoosh is still ON POINT after all of these years! XD <3
Man that is the loudest I’ve laughed in a long time. He was amazing.
He killed that!!😂😂🏆
F*cking Hysterical!
is this guy suppose to be funny i really didn’t laugh at a single thing is it humor for children i don’t understand
id have to say that I've never seen Conan evolve to being unhinged!! great show, highest compliment to a host ever!
I want to know what the rest of his day was like lol
Conan O'Brien...BEAST MODE
Flabbergasted. Utterly flabbergasted. 😮❤ Best thing I've ever seen.
Oh that is proof of pure pain 😢😢😂😂
Best guest!! Conan is the best
what the what, did you nerf the sauces or is conan just that insane?!?!?!
Conan is literally the best actor and host ever.
Oh my god, I laughed sooooo hard! Absolutely hilarious!
Legend
How Funny Im Watching This On Conan O'Brien's Birthday Today Happy Birthday!!🎂
seriously, the best episode of this show ever
Shaun looks terrified hahah LOVE CONAN!
This was wonderful
This is by far the best episode ever aired. Having eaten Da Bomb myself, I'm beyond impressed with Conan.. what a unit!
My favorite thing about Conan is Norm McDonald's visits - they should have had their own show.
this might be my new favorite hot ones
Dude is a riot
Hands down the best episode to date.
"WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME WHY CAN'T I FEEL?!"  🤣
21:08 is why i never will be in show business
That's a top 5 hot ones performance, drinking out of the pepper x is unreal
Haha, just happened to watch this on April 18
Best ever nothing compares
Conan is fantastic!!
I love Conan so much. He's the Dad I never had.
Best episode ever
lol conan had him cursing at the end
Happy Birthday Conan! Mine was on the 15 lol
Are you not entertained? A true Spice Lord. 👏🏿👏🏿
Now compare this episode to Jimmy Kimmel or James Corden and you'll clearly see who's the talkshow-host GOAT!
Gingers have the MC1R gene mutation, which means they require more sedation than other people for surgery. Wonder if that has anything to do with Conan just going all out with the hot sauces or if it's just because he is legitimately crazy.
Conan is a beast 🤣🤣🤣
conan is just the goat
Happy birthday Conan, look forward to show
psychotic break captured live
The new king of hot ones
sometimes watching conan is like watching robin williams
conan and dave grohl, best episodes
Two of the best interviewers ever
Conan O'Brien is doing An Idiot Abroad basically
what an absolute Boss.  good god
Happy Birthday Conan!
I love conan so much
conan showed his ENTIRE behind on this one:)))
Man conan is truly amazing, this is hands down the best episode!
legend
I am here just for Conan 😂❤
gross and cringe, Conan.
American comedy is wierd.
I never got Conan before now, instant fan after this.
This should be the most viewed episode of hot ones, but sadly the fame of hot list movie stares draw in way more views but have half the entertainment.
Best. One. Ever.
We need to see that clip of conan and the water buffalo. Also there should be a streaming service that has all of the conan episodes, they're just so fun
Untethered savage O'Brian is the best Conan
Watching the Best episode of HOT ONES without knowing that today is actually Conan’s Birthday? Is legit. Este hombre vino a dar cátedra de comedia 🫶🏼🔥😍 loved every second of it.
That was amazing.
Conan is just the best...incredible episode!!!!
I'VE NEVER FELT SO ALIVE !!!
Happy birthday, Conan! 😂❤
I hope he doesnt die
This was incredible!!!
this isn't comedy. it is just sad. a retiring comedian think he still has it in him. yet he's pushing himself past limits he knows he can take for "our enjoyment". if Conan keeps this up, he will be 6ft under in 4 years tops.
My favorite episode yet !!!
Conan's poor toilet bowl
Conan is the Hot Ones Legend!
I was laughing so hard
Definitely one of the most insane episodes ever!! and I have been watching it for years. And yet, he continues to be professional while doing all the craziness.  How come they don't have shots of Shawn eating the wings anymore? I actually like the old format before covid, where he asks more specific sets of questions after each wings and then the ig photos and all on the same round table. Recent seasons sometimes there no questions presented or maybe it was edited, i am not sure. But this one is absolutely insane~~ so much joy delivered. Super fun to watch. Too bad couldn't see how did Shawn reacted when Conan was drinking the sauce straight from the bottle or the last dab(pour).😂
Absolute legend.
The running gag of putting wings in his pocket - so simple but so funny
Conan is the man
Greatest episode ever 😂
When it comes to the bit conan can be super human lol
This has to be my favourite episode so far.
Absolutely brilliant.
The BEST one I've seen yet. Love O'Briens energy
THE WINGS SHOULD BE SERVED BY A FINE WOMAN IN A COW GIRL COSTUME
Conan is king❤
Couldnt have had a better end to a season than this one right here.
6:25 Does he low-key call Leno "the other guy" ?
That was the best episode yet
I love Conan.
best. episode. ever.
Conan is hilariously scary
19:29
Maybe the best episode yet
There will *NEVER* be another Hot Ones episode or a guest greater than what we've just witnessed here today.
I have seen a future consisting of 100's of new conan memes and it is glorious.
Hair stylist needs a shout out
So fun fact, gingers have a high pain tolerance...
Always liked Conan and this appearance only reinforced that. He's a savage that would do anything for laugh. Old school badass 👍👍
Big and bold moment: CONAN IS SAVAGE!
conan has charisma for sure. i laughed a lot
First Katt Williams now this
First Katt Williams now this
Conan is insane I love it
Dudes hair had all the hot sauce on it...
Who would have thought that Conan would be the greatest guest that this show has ever had. That was a roller coaster 😂
This was great
Conan is the greatest guest ever.
I'm terrible with hot sauce...... Owns all the hot sauces without flinching
Best episode ever
Oh my god that was hard to watch in the best possible way. 🤣
So extra lol
Ive been thinking abt Conan recently missing his talk show, then this appeared & i finally watched it. He is confirmed still perfect as ever & i was gasping from laughter. A true original comic 👏🏽💕
Conan just conquered hot ones
When he drank from the bottle I screamed
Does Conan have any feeling in his mouth or taste buds? Wow Conan is amazing!!!!
He's like Britta with Mustard on her face
Best episode so far hands down.
Hey I dont know if he was even on the show but can you try to get Henry Cavill? I would live to watch that if you can make it happen.
Happened to watch this episode on April 18th, happy birthday Conan!!!
Conan is INSANE!
I knew he'd be a great guest. Without question.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣he is in so much pain
What an iconic episode.
I love conan  hes so great @!!!!
Conan is Hot Ones' final boss
Dude rubbed the hottest one  all over his lips and face with NO reaction. Swigs right out of the bottle.. no reaction.   What % of these are staged for the guest?
I am a bit afraid that enzymes could get up into my esophagus because i almost always have regurgitation troughout the day. Multiple times.
Sean kind of looks like Niko Belleck from GTA4 in this episode
This is the first time I've ever watched Conan, and was not in my realm of expectations.
Been a fan of  Hot Ones for years and though I haven't seen much of Conan O'Brien--I'd be watching this man's shows from now on. Wise man.. Gave tons of advice--encouraged us to read everything while eating those wings like no one else did-- drank hot sauce like a madman.. I have nothing but 2 thumbs up for him and Sean. Sean did very, very well as always..
Every single person who barely ate any wings/fake wings should be cancelled after this performance.
conan looks like a toddler who's been playing with his food and slamming on the table
Ugh. Trying so hard to be funny
Best freaking Hot Ones 🤣
The new king of Hot Ones. What a legend. I was having a really bad couple of days and this brought me right out of it. What an entertainer ffs.
And I thought the Eric Andre episode was always going to be the most unhinged
Tell me that suit is a rental. I need that.
Why are they so far apart?
Conan deserves primetime all across the Networks. Best Talk Show host since Letterman...no one comes close
Conan's clearly a bird.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY CONAN🎉
YOU GOT CONANED!
The best episode ever!
happy birthday conan!!!
Bring him back for the holiday extravaganza!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Happy birthday, Conan! Great episode!
Man! This was probably favorite episode ever! I've never laughed so hard from watching this show. Holy cow! Conan is a mad man! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan is the only guy who can tell mediocre joke his whole life and still be funny.
Hilarious !!!!! 😂 Conan!!! Loved It !!!
😂😂😂 most amazing and ridiculous interview yet 😂
Best interview ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Mr. O’Brien in reference to your new show please don’t go political.  You don’t need to.  You are funny without politics.  And for me watching this it’s April 18 and I am watching your new show.
BEST GUEST EVER!!!! MUST BE A REPEAT GUEST CONAN IS A BEAST
Make a best HOT ONES Award and give it to CONAN!!! Spice Overlord!
What does he do with the bones?😢
Where is the love beyond all comparison button!?  Conan is a treasure!
i'm still laughing 10 minutes after viewing it
What an absolute champion. Happy birthday Conan. Much love from Texas!
Am I the only one who feels that this is so unbelievably cringey?
“What’s the point of even being alive, if we can’t do this!?!?!” 🤣
🥛
Everyone compliments his research and interview. That's something.
🔥😎🔥
duddddde hes so funny
no one else can be as unhinged during an interview Conan my hero
Conan o Brien
Conan is a BEAST. You need to honor this one with his own sauce FWF
This episode is pure art!
Conan is brilliant man. Absolute stud.
you should have Mehdi Hasan , will he maintain his linguistic eloquence? 😂
THIS EPISODE IS ABSOLUTE CHAOS AND IM 100% HERE FOR IT
"He's not a good doctor, he's affordable."
Best episode everrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Conan O'Brien looks like a changed Dido from Detective Pikachu in the thumbnail when its small.
😂😂😂 real tears... Conan is a maniac
Sheer comedic brilliance matched only by the sheer comedic commitment! Wing Drop!
I enjoyed the PSA at the end.
Dr Arroyo definitely went to Hollywood Upstairs Medical College.  Nobody got this joke. One person did. Nearly no one.
I like Conan.
what a great dude conan
I love how my boy Coco had Sean on his hot ones show...lol ! Long live king Conando !
Best one in a while
"What's wrong with me? Why can't I feel?!" 🤣🔥
He'll never see this but happy birthday Conan 😀
That funny little noise he made quoting the 3 stooges killed me. I had totally forgotten about that but i remember it now thanks to Conan. Haha i'm gonna use it from now on.
Putting the wings in his pockets after he takes one bite 🤣🤣🤣
20:28 is me at work now. Lol
No one can top Coco.. Only if Coco comes again. This is top of mt.everest guests.
Conan is a treasure
"Call the wife!"
Bahahah phew hahaha did he miss the disclaimer that reminds guests that eating tasty wings on the show is only half the experience 😂😂😂😂😂
Argentina and Thailand have the tittles mixt up lol. Thx Max
That was.....something.
The goat🎉
Can we not forget Conan made the Simpsons a great show he left they never been the same.
Watching him eat is disgusting
this was a Conan show with guest bringing wings to the set.   He ruled this episode!!!
20:56
This is the first episode in a few seasons that had me in tears laughing so hard.
Watching this on April 18th, Happy Birthday Conan! 🎉
Conan is the man!
Finally. He's back. Forget podcast. Do other people's shows. Just walk in in the middle of an interview. Funny stuff. :P
Amazing 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best ever🎉
King absolutely slayed!!!
I can't stop watching this. 😂 This is brilliant and  instructive on so many levels!
13:58
The best episode there is ever going to be period He didn't set a bar he launched it into space.
Conan I feel like is one of the few true showmen left this era.
He'll need the super expensive TP with lotion added in after that.  "And it burns burns burns, the ring of fire! The ring of fire..."
conan my man... the top g
Hands down the best ever episode of Hot Ones. It’s not even remotely close.
Till now the best one
Only watching bc its Conan the host has the swag of a wet dish rag.
Can't wait for his comeback. I despise Kimmel and Colbert.
Both are same height sitting down but standing up, Conan towers over Sean. Long legs are the key.
This EP was truly amazing, I mean I've never seen a guest like this gone this wild before. Liker SERIOUSLY!! This has been the best hot ones I've ever seen, truly amazing
That mademy life.!
I don't say this lightly, but this might be the funniest thing Conan has ever done.
Can we get Jim Carrey on the show?
The doctor had me ROLLING!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Conan KILLED IT!!
10:37 Rare Conan profanity!
WHY CANT I FEEL
5:44
Happy birthday conan, you made me happy manytimes...thanks
❤❤❤❤
Pure mental! Love it
Would love to see him do 1 episode as an honorary host.
Amazing
This is why Conan is the best!
Conan is the peak of a persona ...
He sounds like lovitz.
Conan proved he is deserving of all the respect he gets. My man became the Johnny Knoxville of hot wings.  Entertain first, deal with the pain later.
GOD WHAT A LEGEND.
That is a 60 year old man doing that. XD
Are you sure you had the right sauce? And this is not scripted beforehand something's up. He keeps talking to talking like nothing's affecting him. I called b*******
Happy Birthday Conan, I'm glad you overcame the water buffalo incident
One of the most entertaining episodes after Gordon Ramsey
Conan is an absolute legend
I've been rocking with Conan since the 2000s! Legendary.
Conan is the only Irish person who doesn’t look like a soggy potato sack at 60.
Supposedly citric acid and lemon juice stops the heat, so why not have some on the show too.
I don't think the host has sauce. Hot sauce on his wings, there's no way.
Hot Once should also guest Craig Ferguson, it would be hilarious..
I think it's awesome that he did the show. He's really cool. I think one of your most viewed episodes yet.
So. Many great celebrities have come on this show.. The view on this video has already surpassed so many others. Conan is the GOAT
when he...drank the hot sauce..i....i just...wow.  i love conan
What a G 😂
THIS STRESSED ME OUT THIS IS AMAZING
Rudyard Kipling wrote, “Words are, of course, the most powerful drug used by mankind….”  Somewhere along the voyage of Conan vs wings I’ve experienced the dishonesty of Kipling’s words.  As sure as the sun rises and falls the epoch tasteful collaboration of Conan and Hot One shall shall and has permanently altered my neurotransmitters, receptors and other components.
Conan is my spirit animal.
Best host and top 10 human beings I'm aware of.
I have seen every episode.  Without a doubt this mother trucker had me dying.
TOP OF THEM ALLLLL
The show looks amazing.  It might rival An Idiot Abroad as the funniest travel show ever. We’ll see
Amazing
conan's poor sphincter after this.
I just realized how much Conan O’Brien looks like actor Joel Edgerton (Black mass, Warrior) but only if Edgerton had just got clean after a 15 year battle with drugs and alcohol.
Laughed my arae off
So Conan is Lisan al Gaib.
Jordan Schlansky is doing various tasks at the background 😂
Regarding the Water Buffalo injury, the fact you could not get your jeans on and off is more a reflection on how tight your jeans are. I believe Kevin Hart had already pointed that out though.
Conan just opened a new dimension in the First We Feast Universe.
The BEST one yet!
Incredible! This is a must-see.
You should have K-pop singer and Actress Solbin on an episode. She is a spice beast. Total Gangster.
👑👑👑👑👏👏👏👏
Happy Birthday Conan 🥳🎉🍰🎈
just the pulse, it's there. 🤣🤣
To credit Conan's last point about comedy, watching him in this episode felt like watching Bill Murray in his prime again 🤣Absolutely loved it
This is why there's so many flavors of ice cream...opinions and tastes vary. Conan is obviously funny - and I of course laughed at times - but I just felt he was doing a bit the whole time.  He was trying too hard and was so committed to the bit, that I didn't feel that the underlying goal of the show was realized - to disrupt the packaged/manufactured Hollywood interview personae and get a sense of the underlying individual. Conan was so focused on what he was going to say, he often didn't listen or allow Sean to complete his questions.  This episode had its moments, but not a favorite.
Never stop conan
happy birthday Conan!
I’m curious what young people think about this. 😅😂
Happy birthday Conan.
"You can't stop me from being who I am" -Conan
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 He himself is THA BOMB 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My new favorite episode
jesus that ending makes me remember why I love this guy
happy birthday Conan!
I still remember Mila Kunis promised to get Conan on the show years ago. He’s on it now I can finally rest in peace.
Im curious to see ryan renolds in this show.
this guy is out of control 😂😂😂
Crafting a curriculum of comedy  Cacophony
Is life a bit to you???? !!! 😂😂😂
Happy Birthday Conan 🎂
I AINT NEVER GONNA STOP LOVING CONAN OBRIEN!
He's the Goat
HAPPY BIRTHDAY Conan
Happy birthday, Mister Conan O'Brien!! ❤
Haven’t watched in a while.. glad I clicked on this one
Modern day king of comedy.
WHY CANT I FEEL???!!! Hahahha😂😂😂😂😂
Shia LaBeouf who?!!
Connan os the best! Naturally funny and humble
Show? A dark room with a table and cold chicken wings..............
str8 Beast!
That’s by far the best Hot Ones in the history of Hot Ones
I'm accidentaly watching this on April 18th. Nice.
The layers of comedy and the commitment to the bit... Conan is 1 of 1... A total GOD...  for the sorry people who doesn't get it... it's totally fine, just go back to watching Tiktok humor...
Nobody does it like Conan!
what a legend
He is a pro. maybe the proest showman of our times.
WOW!
Happy Birthday!
Bro this has got to be the best episode EVER.!!! All Time.!!! Conan is the GOAT...
I was expecting a random nose bleed at some point but nothing, wow!!
Conan O'Brien will always hold the title of the funniest man in existence
Basically he is an amazing example how self control can effect surrounds you
Conan always had the best night show hands down 💯, Best interview on this show as of now !!!!!!!! Thank you for the laugh 😂 😂
I guess what they say is true.... There will never be another Conan O'Brien
How is this man still alive?
I audibly screamed, “NO!” as he drank the last dab!!!
Forgot how much of a beast Conan O'Brien is.  Best one of these shows I've seen by a LOOOOONG way.  Haven't seen the host played off the stage like this.
By far the best I've seen so far.
Well Done Conan😂
After watching this, I'm convinced that Conan can beat Homelander 😂
Conan, came, he saw, he conquered.
Is dr arroyo real lol
I'm afraid to touch my eyes after watching this...
I got Chris Farley Vibes near the end! Great!!!
What a beast!  For real though I'm worried he might have put himself in the hospital, or melted the toilet the day after. How is Conan doing after this?
He is not dipping them
Conan was too performative. Bordered on annoying
I don’t know if it was a coincidence, but his last answer about what to read for comedy had The Great Dictator speech vibes.  Knowing Conan, it probably was intentional.
How about inviting the world's shortest woman. That tiny girl from India whos like 1 foot tall
HBO spends 50 years building a brand, just to throw it out in the name of freshness. Management 101 for you.
TOP Tier!
Best most epic Hot Ones episode ever!!!
I love that Sean looks slightly scared when faced by this madness! And Conan is a true pro, handling impossible heat while growing red as a tomato but making the show go on all the way!
6:25 “The other guy” 😂😂😂
this cracked me up :))))))))
We need Hoff Ones
Saying spice = taste means he just dumb
This is definitely the best Hot Ones I have ever seen  😂😂😂😂
Best one yet!! Conan a legend 🔥😂
Conan. Still not funny.
Sanest Conan O'Brian appearance
Cone-dogs a beast 😂
The Wandering MC getting spicy!
There's a new definition of brilliant!
He`s so cringe... :|
Conan is genius
And.... thats why da bomb is the only constant in the lineup..
Old Finland memories... ❤
Conan absolutely conned you guys, you seriously didn't know undead are immune to all forms of spice? Easiest check he's ever collected in his life
Best episode EVER!!!!
@CzerwonyPingwin xDDD
That was the greatest episode of all time! Conan is the man! Outdid Kevin Hart bottom to top!
Thank you for finally having Conan .  He is an amazing person I can watch him for days happy b day Conan !
😂 he seems like that Irish auld fella that you'd meet in a pub in the back hole of no where after having too many beverages and is on a rant about something
This video got 7 million views within 6 days. It takes other videos 18 months to reach this.
lol so we’re just gonna pretend Conan doesn’t have the MC1R (red head gene 🧬)? Conan’s hella funny tho.
Is the President Harding thing TRUE?¿???
This was painful in parts.
He is the GOAT!
I don't feel dumber after this 😎
BEST EPISODE EVER! CONAN IS A LEGEND!
Sean finally found a guest whose energy he couldn't match 😂😂
conan manages to go crazy without disrespecting the host. that's a fine line.
Conan, Gordon Ramsey, and Gal Godot have been my favorites of the ones I've seen. Such good sports and authentic people, all of them.
The doctor choking Conan then saying his pulse is there and walking away was so funny
Bring Burr and Conan at the same time, then thank me later
I hnestly can't remember the last time i laughed that hard Conan's bar is insane lol
Dr. Arroyo doesn't need to hear all this, he's a highly trained professional.
Well happy birthday Conan O'Brien 🎉 ! Hope you survived this and are still alive to celebrate 🤣
Wow this is amazing
I say better than Gordon
Conan is batshit crazy but i'm here for it
Never before have I laughed and dry heaved at the same time. Thank you Conan. Thank you Hot Ones.
Never seen Conan so red lol
Bring Hideo Kojima!!!
Happy bday bro
I want Nicholas Galitzine and Taylor Zakha Perez on this channel who will win?
Ah he's a beaut.
Happy birthday Conan I think I'll get hbo max sub just to see your show
lol I love Conan, I wish I had his energy
Happy birthday to Conan O'Brien!
Best episode ever 😂❤
Conan has been my favorite late night comedy host for years.   This episode might go down as the most viewed episode on this channel.  Fantastic show gentlemen! 👍🏼👍🏼
COOL WHIPPED CREAM ON AN AUGUST AFTERNOON
"Read widely, read well". Best advice ever right there.
Insert, *CONAN*, Hot One's Hall of Fame.
Insert, *CONAN*, Hot One's Hall of Fame.

Insert, *CONAN*, Hot One's Hall of Fame.
You can tell his agency told him to be eccentric and spontaneous because TV can't keep up with the internet, and so he has to stay relevant
CONNNAAANNNNN!!!!!!!!!!
RIP Conan O' .. I'm all torn up! 😆 What a ride, on the back of a mad unicorn show horsing around 🌠🤩
The goat
Conan to me was, is and will always be a difficult guy to dislike ❤
Wow. What. Wow. Wow. How. Wow. Who. Wow.
I started crying at the end, only cause that’s the Conan that made me laugh as a kid. I’m 23 now and I’ve been Conan’s fan ever since I was born, so my parents say but he’s given me enjoyable laughs during my worst times. I’m sad his late night show is gone but I enjoy watching him being himself
Conan did his research on your show as well, the bar has been raised! Good luck following that...
Maaaaaaan😮😮😮😮😮 Conaaan💥💥💥
Motherfther owned the show. 😂
this is the best episode ever.
No joke this is the first Hot Ones that actually had me crying with laughter. Conan was on another LEVEL with this one 😂👏
Best Episode ever.
best hot ones interview ever
LOL insane!!!! Loved it.
Conan needs to do a DVD-style commentary on this.
Conan o'brien is 6'4??!?!
This was commitment!
That dude is weird.
What a legend. Best Guest
Conan returning to the Tonight show has 1.6 million views. Conan on Hot Ones has 7.3 million views. Just sayin’
this is epic. had to go back 8 months for someone to break 7 mill views ... in less than a week
Why wasn't this uploaded tody, April 18 ? CMON ! xD That would have been HOT !
Doctor Arroyo is truly one of the doctors of all time
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED
Lots of life lessons in this. The man certainly lives life to the fullest ❤
Things conan do just to entertain us ❤
Conan is such a Beast... Best Guy alive.
That’s why he’s the goat 😂
Canon got high on wings
Happy Birthday Mr Conan 🍾🥂
Best episode ever! 😂😊
The best episode ever!!
This man was robbed of his career by Jay Leno and as a result we have freaking Jimmy Fallon hosting the tonight show. Its completely backwards. JL should be ashamed of himself.
Funniest guy ever. He should run a show
This is like the Level 999 player doing a quest with a Level 100
I was laugh crying at the end so hard
PURE IRISH CHAOS
Legend.
I  CANT  STOP  LAUGHING.   🤣
😂😂😂
BEST EVER.
I literally fell off my chair when he gulp that sauce.
Great show, Great host and this was your best one out there. Goat really told us the best words with sauce on all of his face XD 23:30
Happy birthday, Conan O'Brien!
Now get him on Cold ones 😂 how crazy it would be?
Happy birthday, Conan O'Brien!
I have exam in 3 days I will watch the show now bye
Conan is really gonna regret these choices the next time he visits the bathroom. lol
the music is pretty funny
Best one yet
Conan is still numero uno
Call the wife ! Hahahaha
Conan is the GOAT!!!
Okay, now who’s coming with me to rewatch those classic Conan and Jordan Schlansky episodes all over again.
I have a new show on Max: Proceeds to trash the company's new name. Conan is a barbarian and a master.
Ladies and gentlemen, you've just experienced true greatness.
He went full crazy. I love it lol.
He is not fine on the last Dab. I see it in his eyes.
He is an unstoppable force, that was the most insane and hilarious episode I've ever seen
Jordan Schlansky should've been there lol
That was fukin hilarious!
The pocketing of wings killed me , Conan never misses.  Great interview too
Oh my god Conan just obliterated the show. As a long time viewer, and one on the fence about Conan as a late night host, one of the greatest guests of all time. HE LICKED THE SAUCE OFF DA BOMB
never realized how much I wanted Billy Crystal to be on the show. something about how he laughs and controls the interview clicked on this one.
Just...HOW????
Coolio's ghost was yelling "NOOOOOOOO, CONAN! DON'T DO IT!" from the afterlife.
❤❤❤love some Conan
this might be the greatest hot ones episode ever made
This is the best one yet!!
Happy birthday Conan!
Bet 5 he went to the hospital a bit after filming
Fark me dead Conans still the man he just made me laugh out loud for the first time in so long.. WOW what a unit
Conan's hair is better than trump's
this is kaufman level comedy. brilliant.
This man’s insane and I love it
Sean doesn't write these questions does he
Conan manhandled this episode!! 💯👌🏽⚰️💪🏽
If you type in Water Buffalo on YouTube, the first thing that comes up is Conan after that,.. 😂😅👍
Coonaaaan Oo'Briieennn!!
At the moment that I'm posting, 7m people have seen this clip so far. Because a guy wasn't afraid to swallow hot sauce whole, straight out of the bottle, to earn your comedy respect.
The hot one's wing was the only one he finished
Oh my god! What a badass!
As I'm watching, today is Conan's birthday, and I had no idea! Wonder if the algorithm is pushing it precisely because of that? XD
10/10
conan is the only good late night host
Im starting to think that the sauces have drugs
"Veni, vidi, vici!"- Conan
Conan is getting hotter as he gets older 🔥
I guess I’m getting MAX to watch this legend
This is the funniest thing I’ve seen Conan do.
Why is he putting them in his pockets?  lol
Chris Farley took over conan
The show is over, they can stop now! ;)
Conan won't even say Jay Leno's name..thats beef
I fukin love Conan 😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅 "Mr.nofuks"
Conan never disappoints
18:39 "You can't stop ME from being who I am! To quote my hero Popeye, 'I yam what I yam, ok?' I said it and Gandhi said it."  🤣🤣🤣. What does Gandhi have to do with anything?
That was a great episode. I hope Conan is on again. True champ.
100% professional 😂🙌
Happy Birthday Conan! I wish you have many many more and never stop making us all laugh and cry until we choke and die! LONG LIVE THE KING OF LATE NIGHT CONAN O'BRIEN!!!!🎉🎉🎉
Views on this video alone show why this man should still be on television. One of the best hosts ever.
Dawg
It’s almost a shame Jordan Schlansky wasn’t forced to eat all the Hot Wings in Conan’s stead whilst being mocked by Conan 😂 23:09 I’m fine!!  I’m F’ing Fine!! They could have followed that up with a fade to black, in memorium bit…
Best hair on utube
Arguably two of the greatest interviewers of all time, going head to head. Magic.
I was just waiting for Da Bomb 😂
Best guest ever 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Id love to have a conversation with Connan, holy fk the dude is absolutely brutal and real
DR. Nick wasn't available?
Da bomb is sub 200,000. Ive still no idea why folks fear it.
Holy cow.... 😂. You rule, Conan.
That's faked, right?
Youtube screening kind comments now? Ok
I didnt expect this to get sensual near the end
Jesus i forgot how funny Conan was and also how much of a legend. He dominated.
That man is incredible at what he does! Definitely top 3 comedians of all time!
Legend
There is not a single episode that comes close to this one!
The fear in Sean’s eyes at the last wing!
Oh My Goodness, Conan is real danger.  He cut loose a little. Very funny, had to leave a comment.  Awesome
greatest show ever
how will anyone top this
I love Conan O'Brien
Happy birthday Conan !!
Happy birthday Conan. You definitely made a new fan. 04/18/24.
Anyone know the name of that background music starting at 11:07
BEST EPISODE EVER, BEST GUEST EVER
Conan an absolute beast!
Conan is truly built different and is without a doubt the best talk show host of all time
He crazy
How is it even possible? Bravo, Conan!!!
The water-buffalo.  EPIC Conan!
It's AI Conan
🤘 LEGEND 🤘
Conan O'Brien really represented for Gen-X.
I sincerely don't understand why you did Conan... Dude is one of the least funny people on the planet. His entire career has been failing upwards. I really wish this dude would just disappear from media
Most pro ever
hands down the best episode ever!! Conan has not lost a step!!
Why did I not expect it to be this insane?
Later that night when Mr. Obrien arrived home he let out a loud, Honey - Kids daddy brought supper!
By far, the funniest episode. There is no match. Hats off to you, sir
SMH 🤦🏻‍♂️
ALV este es de los buenos
King Coco
GOAT
Sean is no Nardwuar but he gets the job done
Brilliant
whenever you see Conan, you know you gonna get full of entertainment, never disappoints
Conan like General Grievous over here collecting them wings as he slays em.
This isn’t a bit this is life!!!!!!! ❤
The doctor checking his pulse got me good 😂 don’t usually laugh at that kinda humor 😂
That’s the craziest thing i’ve seen since GG Allin
What a performer.
He might be insane
This is probably the best episode of Hot Ones I have watched yet. Conan may be an acquired taste but God he was gold this episode. Loved every second of it.
Thats why he is the absolute best. I litterally don't know anyone better than Conan!
I love you Coco
The older he gets, the more he looks like Robert Patrick?
Kedakai! As god made her. … no? We’re not doing that any… my bad.
That was the spiciest episode yet!
Wow! One of the best show to date. Conan is a beast!!
LEGEND
Sean is scared
Out of ALL the Hot Ones episodes I've seen ever SO far, this is THE BEST BY FAR. Conan + Sean = HILARIOUS! Well done, bring some more like this one! Comedians seem to work well with this platform. Hotties aren't too bad, either. :)
genius
Conan is a GOAT..
9:25
Best. One. Ever.
Formal petition for Lisa Ann Walter amd Elaine hendrix
gtegeggegege
Is he still alive?
I can only imagine all of the previous guests who have experienced this gauntlet watching this nervously sweating over Conan straight up chugging the sauces
I love how he sets himself up as a heel like in wrestling, that hes willing to make himself look absurd to get people to laugh at his misfortune.
18:31 face expression of the year
The Best!
Quite possibly the best Hot Ones episode, funny, poetic, and makes me excited to watch his new show.
Oh god, i missed his chaotic nature 😭😭
Craig Ferguson is still better.Prove me wrong
Great interviewer, best interviewee
WHAT. CONAN? WHY IS HE HERE? I LOVE CONAN!!❤🔥🔥🎉
"The other guy, y'know..." More shade than the total eclipse
Home run episode
Absolutely great episode!
Conan O Brien wins first we feast forever.
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is a showbiz professional.  Channel the pain! Channel the pain!
Total pro
This is gold 😅
He is badass.
One of the best episodes of hot ones 🔥🔥 was great seeing conan ill be watching that new show on max 💯🤙
Conan I ❤ you 4 Ever .
I find out Conan has the same birthday as me from HOT ONES!?!?!?!
lol
I need the number of Conan's dealer.
well, conan won Hot Ones.
Mark wiens
“The other guy”…haha
Conan is king.
Turning red😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
WhyTF are they still sitting so far apart? 😂😂
conan is the goat
Here’s to Conan O’Brien, he gave fantastic real world advice, was funny, and took the heat proving us redheads can eat spicy foods!  But seriously , this was one of your best guests yet. 😂🎉😂
While I like some spice, it’s not a prerequisite to food tasting nice. (Just in response to his tasteless food comment).
I hate Conan o brien. So unfunny and overrated. He belongs in the Jim Carrey era 30 years ago
Pure gold. I love that Conan plays for both his immediate audience in the room, plus for us far off viewers.  The best!
That was the funniest one I have ever seen.  Conan is a treasure.
It's the pure horror and awe on Sean's face as he stares at Conan after drinking the last dab from the bottle 😂😂
Conan is solid gold. Comedy seeps from his tight Irish pores.
Amen Conan!!!!!!!
He’s the GOAT.
Can’t help but wonder what refreshments were in Conan’s dressing room.
Poor PA! 😮
😂 Wow!
From highschool (11 years ago) to now having 2 kids, CONAN IS STILL THE MAN.
Hands down the best episode ever.
Is Conan, in a different jacket????
Idris Elba wanted to be the hottest Hot One. I think Conan took the title
I've seen fan edits of guests like Jenna ortega who will stomach the big bomb and say it tastes good or whatever, but Conan O'Brien takes it to a whole new level by drinking the sauce. What a season Finale. Man is a LEGEND.
Undisputed king of Hot Wings.
That was hands down incredible
Oh what a madman. Absolutely just guzzling those danger sauces.
Best episode all season. Love you Coco!
Most insane episode yet. 10/10
INCREDIBLE, the most insane episode I’ve seen, loved it
This was the funniest Hot ones to date Conan is an absolute comedy legend and now a hot sauce LEGEND!! 😂🤣
God I love Conan
16:48 Oops, that may have been a bad, bad, bad mistake. Dont try at home people 😂.
I think there might be something actually wrong with him
I’m gonna be honest, I watch these only for the guest. Sean is such a cringey interviewer to me. I tried to like him, but after this many episodes, it hasn’t happened.
my new favorite episode. i'm dying. i'm dead.
the end made me laugh so bad
This man  Commits  to the bit
What a way to end the season by guesting Dr. Arroyo with Conan of course... 😂😂😂
Best first we feast episode ever 👍🏼
Conan doing Conan things and he didn't disappoint!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 DUDE IM DYING!!!!!!!
As soon as he mentions a "comedy vacuum", I thought: so Finland? and immediately after that he actually mentions Finland lol
Greatest episode ever.
A 10/10 show. Best show you have ever made
The funniest video I’ve ever seen.
Hot ones needs to stop with Da Bomb. Hot sauce with horrible flavor shouldn’t be featured. I absolutely love extremely hot sauces, but only if they also taste good. Da Bomb is a fail on the second part.
I never liked late night shows, but Conan is another level and I love his work!
I want nothing more than a Conan and Andy comedy tour
Either he really likes spicy food or his taste buds are completely dead or close to dead.
yo
....
Wish it was all vegan, at minimum?
Conan is a legend! 😁
Cannot wait for that “I’m fine” meme to come out😂
That was awesome. Conan’s a nut.
Conan looks like Biden but with red hair 😂
This was the greatest thing I’ve ever watched
The dude is insane
Best one yet!
never laughed so hard 🤣🤣
Never forget: Sean was afraid of being exposed about having a pornstar gf, so he dumped her.
Trump, funnier than Nixon that way. Criminal Clown disease in our presidents... wonderful.
"He's been my medical doctor for 25 years... where'd you go to medical school?" ..."In 1998"
Guys. In all seriousness.  Why CAN he do this?! I feel that it affected his behavior some but he didn't seem physically phased by it! Even on his skin and lips and nose. Like whaaaat?!
Thank you for the water buffalo animation lol
conan makes me happy to be alive
Conan is a savage
This is BY FAR the best episode ever! no one will ever top this... Period. well done, Conan!
100 bucks he says “good question “ or “excellent question “
i would get MAX for this man's show
crazy most people are in pain. hes like its nothing
Conan is and always will be the king. Hilarious and a class act.
Please do Tony Hinchcliff
I knew when he told the story about the water buffalo and how he recklessly jumped on that thing at a suggestion and got himself a massive hematoma after a spill, that this man was going full pro wrestler and just maximize his pain for the show.
Best show ever!!!! Thank you!!!!
Never had HBO Max and probably never will after subscribing once for conan o brien
This man defined my late night in my teens in the early 90s
Cooooookooooooruuuuuuuuuuu!
He's drugged up..
That’s it for the show, sorry to say. But no one is ever going to top this. Conan is number one in everything he does! Love this guy! 🎉❤😂
Uhhhhh, He lies so much given how well he handled  it… not respect . He’s just giving us a cool whip show.
Before being Conan’s Doctor for 25 years, Dr. Arroyo practiced out of the office of Dr. Vinnie Boombatz
Still fighting for bringing on a coach from a robotics team. Know we're not famous people, but we all fight for funding because most school systems don't fund us fully or at all.  We're building the next gen and could use some help. Your show could bring a light to that. Would love to do it myself, but find someone local if that's easier. Community service for the kids episode each season!
God I missed you Conan
Is Dr. Arroyo the same guy who is Conan’s personal trainer in the Kevin Hart work out  sketch?
End the show now.... Never will a guest surpass Conan
*Dr. Aroyo actually wrote me my prescription*  for hot ones' hot wings hot sauce.  I paid him with silver because he wouldn't accept cash.
This is exactly how I envisioned Conan’s interview masterclass; a complete chaotic mess of nonsensical bits while also being the most important class you ever took.
disgusting episode pretty much not enjoyable sorry conan gross
Conan you are the mf man
This is the funniest and best episode of all time! Thank you for bringing Conan on!
I think seeing this made me  switch favorite TV host
conan rules.
That was insane lol!
lolll this was the best show hahahahaha
Best episode ever
He is the greatest man alive.
Conan: a legend eats wings
i honestly had no idea conan obrien was this funny xD madman
Conan cray cray lol
Bro faced those peppers like no one ever had before In this show and still gave out a badass speech In the end. What a Legend!
Conan to me is the GOAT of talk shows!!!
Conan is a genius
Bro this is the first time i laughed so hard watching hot ones 😂
I'd say he's lost his mind but that happened ages ago. Also, he completely dominated the show.
The only hot ones guest i will ever watch.
Conan officially won Hot Ones
the funniest episode by far
I have never laughed so hard during one of these interviews.  And no Simpsons questions?  Still kudos to Conan and all the crew at First We Feast... top notch!
Conan is a beast and he’s always been willing to suffer for comedy. I honestly don’t even find it at that funny but I respect his commitment and his guts. I was a major fan of his show back in the mid 90s when I was a teenager. I believe it was the greatest late night show for comedy. Talk show ever at that time.
That was amazing 😂😂!!  Only other person to match that energy was the late great, Robin Williams.
Conan rules❤❤❤❤❤❤
Get Gordon and Conon together on this show immediately. That's gold waiting to happen. If only Norm could be there.
He Is legitimately the GOAT
conan destroyed this, best hot ones yet
“Call the wife!”
“You’ve got about 4 years to live, tops.” 😂
the constant background music is dumb
Conan’s the man. He ownsssssss the interviews lol
It’s more like this:  “Conan o Brian with guest star Sean Evan’s” seriously, he knows how to take control of a show no matter who’s it is haha 😂
OK... we that may be the best thing i have ever seen. well done by both parties
Best ever
Shout out Warren G Hardy 🙏 🫡 🦞
Best episode of hot one's PERIOD.
Awsten Knight next episode please
GOAT level Hot Ones episode. I saw the thumbnail when it dropped and thought "that should be a good one, I'll have to watch that soon." Then I finally watch it 6 days later and my sides hurt. Bravo.
I believe Conan will go down as one of the top 3 late night hosts of all time
Jesus CHRIST. Conan absolutely KILLED that. Never really watched him, but I’m definitely watching his new show now.
I'm getting Denethor's tomato vibes
Best one ever…..
23:00 has to be a meme LOL
GOOD, almighty Lord )  Funny and painfull at the same time. Bravo!
Conan is a beast
Conan made every single person on that episode look like wimps. I grew up on Conan O'Brien. He was and is still the best.  Kudos and I hope you don't get any ulcers from that performance. 😂
Why? Conan! WHY?!!  You have nothing to prove.
I love this man
I don't know about you but I'm voting Conan O' Brian 2024 2024 2024 !!!!!!!!
havent laughed that hard in a while
This has to be the best one yet !!!
This is by far the best episode! You're going to have to go very hard to top this one.
This was amazing!
This has ruined all other Hot Ones episodes for me because they can't be this one
Easily my favorite hot ones episode, which is saying a lot. Conan is such a natural entertainer
I like how his Richard Nixon impersonation is straight off of Futurama 😭
That was unreal….thank you
I am not usually a big Conan fan, but this was pure magic. I can't remember the last time a guest made me laugh out loud this hard.
His show dropped on April 18th coincidentally and I’m watching it on April 18th coincidentally. It’s a conansidence
Wow my favorite episode ever.
Dude, coco has the best fit in Hot Ones ever
I F***ING LOVE Conan
“Dr. Arroyo can we get a baseline pulse” “It’s there…”💀
23:00 me when my therapist asks how I’m doing.
This was the most inspirational thing I’ve seen on the internet since Shia told me to “just do it.”
23:00 needs to be a meme
Conan is the absolute best human ever!
Kinda boring questions this time around, but Conan made it great
Love Conan. Absolute legend.
So much respect for Conan. It is such a fantastic interview!
Bravo Conan. Instant classic.
Conan is a god!!
Best. Episode. EVER!
I have been watching this show for many years and I think Conan was the most entertaining guest of all times.
Holy! WHAT! HE'S A GOD! HOW! THAT SWIG OF THAT BOTTLE!
BEST EPISODE YET!  I haven't laughed that much by myself in years.
Not only is Conan  not funny, but he is  also a total idiot.
Absolutely the best episode yet!! He is an animal !😂😂😂
Why keep the wings in your pocket? Weird, were you worried about leaving your DNA?
This man is the greatest late-night host. I wish we could go back 30 years, to a time when the future was still this amazing mysterious place, and he introduced us all to the possibilities that would come IN THE YEAR 2000!
Single best episode yet!
Somone check on Conan!!
hahaha this is amazing. Pure entretainment...!
Conan embraced the vibe versus be average such a legend !!!
Conan was trying too hard for attention... Sean was great as usual..  Worst 'episode' of first we feast because of Conan's 'over reaction'...
Ohhh conan ❤ for the win !!!!
i almost peed laughing at Conan literally
I love them all and this is the worst someone trying to be funny however "read widely and read well" is the best/ true line this episode.
Oh you watched this and thought it was the funniest thing ever but you don't listen to his podcast every Monday and Thursday???   What are you doing??
The way that he absolutely cannot handle the hot sauce but is able to turn his brain off because he knows chugging it will get a laugh is the reason he's the funniest person I've ever seen in my life.
He’s still the best!
Is and will always be a complete Legend !
Hilarious as usual Conan
After this Conan needs his own hot sauce.  What should the name of the sauce be?
that last part from conan was for us young gens
“Dr arroyo. He’s not the best, but he’s affordable. “ 😂
Him just  salivating while the hot sauce delirium is in full swing 😅
Classic
man conan is such a ball of energy amazing guy
By far the best one yet.  Needed Dr Arroyo a bit more, amazing character! Conan the GOAT indeed
He probably has an ulcer, but the exit on that curtain call may have been a little messy.  This was why he's so great.
"Was it a four year medical school?"  "It was supposed to be."  Thank God Conan still had the contact information for Dr. Leo Spaceman from his time at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.
I was looking at this video last night and it had 6.9 million views. In about 18 hours it's gotten 3 million more views.   I don't think this guy really understands how much he is beloved.
I'm an old guy.  I hate "late night shows", but I love Conan.
I'm a long time fan of Conan. Just heard a podcast where Brian Grazer said they don't market streaming they way they did movies.  I'm wondering if Conan was so incredibly extreme with his hot sauce because he is marketing his new show.  It worked.
LETS GOOOOO, LOVE YOU COCO
By far!!!! The best hot ones ever!!!!!!
Mic drop. A comedian entertainer would have to light themselves on fire and rant for 20 minutes to match this madness. Big-Up Conan, you are a warrior for you cause.
"the water buffalo and i made amends we're good now. he even came to our barbecue last time"
"I said it and Ghandi said it...uh....Popeye."
I think i like O'Brien lol
The greatest episode, Conan controlled the whole interview
Best one yet!!!!
He (Conan) makes a good point... you could easily do other interview work. Even old fashion TV style!!
Conan is not a real boy.
My moms birthday is April 18th.
This might be the best 30 minutes in the history of television
Mans turned into Frank Booth
Might be the best episode of Hot Ones yet. Conan dominated.
greatest episode
This was pure comedy gold
the doctor was absolutely f*cking hilarious 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
That was intense!
this is equally epic disgusting and absolutely f*cking insane, easily the craziest and grossest episode in the show's history, delivered as always literally making it the best episode of whatever show he appears on, just batsh*t UNHINGED
This is by far the best ever episode lol.  Conan delivered above and beyond any expectations lol. Superb!
Conan is The King. 👑
This is the most unhinged Hot Ones to date! Great choice for the season finale!
Wow! I wasn't expecting Conan would be such a beast!
Shouting Conan sounds like Shake Zula the mic ruler the old Schooler
Greatest thing I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂
Bomb of Insanity is the equalizer hot sauce........
W0W! I was worried about Seans eye's. With all the snorting, spitting & drooling flying out of Mr O'Briens face! Eee Yicks
This was more painful then dj khalid. Hes so full of himself, and not funny at all.
❤❤❤
HE IS CRAZY AF!😂😂
Greatest. Hot Ones. EVER! O'Brien is a true treasure. What an exceptional and inspirational human!
Why does Conan sound like Mr. Potato Head 🤣
Hands down best episode of all time, I was waiting for Conan to say “I’m conducting this interview now!”
Mainstream TV didn't even see Conan's full range
Ok this made me laugh!
He was baited by the first bottle he opened then dabomb hit and he got a bit scared but it was too late to hold back hahaha conan certainly a new Hot Ones Legend. Sean's reaction to dabomb opening you could hear his fear for conan as he drenched the wing. lol
What a genius...
Amazing!
Conan, the Pepparian
My god is Conan's energy infectious. I can feel my heart rate increasing just watching this
Happy birthday CONAN O'BRIEN
Bro dr arroyo has the same last name as me 😮
Well done.
“If there was a mic drop I’d do one” 😂 what a great show this was
What a legend ❤
Wow!! This guy has set a nee bar… best entertainment I’ve seen in a while besides Chef Gordon Ramsey episode!
I skipped to the end and got so confused 😭
Pure savage 😂
I've been watching Conan since Late Night and even went to one of the tapings back in the day. Pure comedic genius. Hands down, my favorite episodes of Hot Ones ever!
I'm not sure if I should be impressed or worried. Four years tops, haha.
Probably one of the best episodes ever
Its absurd how talented conan is
Brillant
This is the best HOT ONES episode of all time. Conan is the goat!
Conan just kidnapped someone else show! What a legend! Only Bill Burr manages to keep up with Conan!
The best finale EVER 🎉
He's acting like Rick from the pilot episode
What. Did. I.  Just. Watch.
The lean in and chat on Larry Sanders was usually epic
its like cave johnson but in real life.
I love how this is the antithesis of the DJ Khaled episode
Bravo Conan Bravo ,,, Destroyed Hot Ones
Probably top 3 episodes of all time
Goated
I almost cried a the end
THIS HAS GOT TO BE MY FAVOURITE  HOT ONES EPISODE CONAN YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CRAZY!!🤣🤣🤣  ALSO R.I.P YOUR TOILET FOR THE FORESEABLE FUTURE🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥
7:02 - Best compliment ever.  100% accurate too.  Sean is indeed a great interviewer.
Hahahahaha😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣  This one was really good 👍
Conan’s deterioration into insanity was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen
I'm not sure if conan is having a mental breakdown at the end.😂
Funniest guest ever!
Proving Conan will do anything anyone tells him to do.
This feels staged without Sean knowing. Conan wanted to look cool. Seems fishy
CONAN is an EFFING BEAST !!!!!! The GOAT. You will never do better.
April 18th is tomorrow- happy birthday 🥳
Love Conan
You ever watch something in your room by yourself and you just have to give a standing ovation?   It's been like 30 minutes and I can't stop smiling and laughing. Conan truly is king. Greatest comedian of our generation. I love this man, and everything he does so much!
Was it real though?
Other than when Mike Epps said Sean looked like Smeagol, this is the only other time I have seen Sean lose it and in a completely different way.
Conan is a straight legend for this!? Incredible 😂😂😂
Who knew there was an Eric Andre hidden inside Conan.
16:52 for the ladies.
That's the best episode EVER!!
Best one ever 🍗 🔥
😂😂😂😂😂😂 good lord what a great ending hahahaha
Funniest Hot Ones episode
Conan never disappoints😂😂😂 Take that Dj Khalid😂😂😂😂😂😂
THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WILDEST VIDEO!!!!!
Conan tastes the spice and turns into Lisan Al Gaib.
kids who didnt know conan before this god such an amazing introduction through this vid
I love that man.
2:13 The voice may say he doesn't fear the wings, but the face says he definitely did. What's amazing is the voice was right in the end.  Also, Conan should be allowed to call it HBO Max, or else we'll keep thinking he's referring to his old band leader.
This by far was the best one yet!!!
God I adore this man. One of the best. Wish this episode was longer honestly.
Dumb and dumber did it already
I'm in tears. Not just due to Conan's uncanny comedic ability, but because I came to the epiphany that regardless of how much Conan has given us for so many years, he's still so unrelenting and self sacrificial in his mission to entertain that he will literally put it all on the line like this. My favorite entertainer, writer, host of all time, and one of the greatest comedic minds that the world has ever seen.
What a legend *standing ovation 😂
I’ve never seen someone tank the wings like that
This guy is so freaking hilarious lol
Cancel the show… it won’t get better, it can’t get better
As the snot is pouring out of his nose!!!  HAHAHAHAHA!!!!
I am not worthy in advance 🎉
This was legendary. 😆 I just love his way of reacting—his form of comedy basically raised me, so I’m dead rn 😂
Sean’s audible gasps 😂
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥛🥛🥛🥛
The last like 3/4 wings, i’m getting strong robin williams vibes. Absolute insane behaviour from conan there 😂😂
Best episode ever 😂👍👌
Greatest. Episode. Ever!!
I was scared for his eyes when he was rubbing his face.
he killed it
Sheer f'ing willpower. 😂
That was the BEST episode ever...I am crying 🤣
best hot ones ever!  Go Conan!  Not sure who going to follow that up.
Buffoon. But the end saved it. Good arroyo.
This was easily the best one for me. What an absolute champion.
Conan is insane lol
I just don't see the appearl of Conan O'Brien but that's just me i guess. Overacting is how i would call his work.
This is the best interview ever
The most absolute GOAT in both ways there is. Happy Birthday Conan!!!
Most epic video.  Watching conans decent into madness is the best and his last bit of wisdom on comedy is great.  Hes melting
wheres Andy Richter?
Do you know if Dr. Arroyo is taking new patients?
Sean is the GOAT of interviewing. Theres no one like him. Connan CRUSHED but thats no surprise. Just 2 GOATS.
Legit impressed
He earned every person to watch his new show...Ill be there.
No funny,,, just annoying.
Conan doesn't need a medical doctor he needs a psychiatrist.
Best yet.
The guy who admits the job is too much is probably the only guy who understood the responsibility. Everyone else I'ds there for ego or money.
Stockholm represent! Seriously, we loved having you Jimmy. Packed house. All ages. Looking forward to next time!
Conan committed to the sauce and it turned out to be one of the greatest inteviews ever. Amazing guest. Respect him for giving his all, otherwise it would not have worked. 🎉❤
Hilarious
Lol he did surprisingly well.
Great segment. I'd love for FWF to do a follow-up wherein Conan shares what his next few hours and days were like!
man, i think this one is the best FWF so far....maybe i am biast cuz it's Conan
JFC he really did raise the bar
Meanwhile, a guy like me has one DAB of the Bomb, and I feel like I'm gonna die.  How TF is this even POSSIBLE??????????
I'm begging you for Steve Harvey.
14:01 he crazy
I Like this Guy with Red Hair and Red face
what an absolute legend!
Where did you go to medical school? Up State. hahahahaha  If that doctor was shorter he could pass for Jordan Schlansky.
This is it. The best episode. The absolutely peak.
What a pure raw display by Conan. Little gross at the end but absolutely incredible. Was laughing the entire time
Bear witness the legend that is Conan
That final monologue was pure perfection
I dont see them put on the sauce. Theyre simply eating wings with no sauce. And why is he putting the bones into his pocket?!?! So weird.
I was so hoping he would look onto the camera and say, "This isn't going well, is it."
Greatest episode in history! Conando is king
Yoooo
THIS IS THE BEST HOT ONES EVER . IM CRYING LAUGHING
Scoville level of the Last dab Xperience is complete BS. It is lab tested ~60 000 :D
That man is a legend!
What a Great Season Finale!!!
Conan with orange hair, orange skin, and eating firey hot orange wings...ouch.
this is one of the best episodes ever!
doesnt disappoint
I very rarely leave comments on videos, but I must say that was the best interview I have seen on this show.
I wish Mr. O'Brien would return to hosting a new show, considering the people hosting late-night shows now are ALL vanilla.
Oh my God. I almost died laughing. Best episode ever
This man is a legend in my opinion
I love how by the end there was color to Conan's face and he had turned into Lewis Black 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
We have Da bomb and it's crazy 😂
im crying
Bravo Conan, bravo!
best. episode. ever.
Conan took that heat like a champ!
Putting the half eaten wings into his pocket was the ultimate power move.
Does the show air april 18th worldwide?
Gee...Want some more BLUSH/BRONZER?!! 😂😂
Was this even real? LOL
And then the restroom scene. Yikes!
this may be the best one to date
Conon had great sense of humor ❤
Conan: absolutely loses his mind and screams Sean: “so what was your reaction to the 2020 presidential election?”  😂😂😂
This feels like a new monumental pillar in internet history. What a show!
Best episode ever
whatched this twice...... not gonna get better than this....looooool......
"Call the wife" 😂😂😂
He totally cried the moment the cameras stopped rolling!
Finally someone worth watching. You guys haven't had anyone worth watching on since Tony hawk
When he says "call the wife" I lot it
Conan and Craig. the rest are hacks
This was so good. This might be my favorite one ever
Arroyo must be the physician of the Chosen One.
I wish I could like this video twice
that man scares me
Total legend! Shia LaBeouf who?!
Conan is such a madman, you can see his eyes melting at the end but I've never seen anyone destroy the wings like he did 😆
Funny but gross at the same time !
This was the best show on hot ones.
Is Dr. Arroyo accepting new patients? His knowledge and bedside manor seem above par.
Happy birthday Conan O'Brien
Conan must be on drugs in this one.  He seems different.  He is funnier without the F bombs
conan ... lol.. best one ever show..... looooool...
Honestly, after da bomb, nothing is spicy anymore...
61 years old tomorrow, crazy
literally laughed and cried . Thank you Conan .. Please never stop being you ..
Hands down the greatest episode ever.
Hahahahahaha just covered in sauce
This episode was freaking awesome!  I loved the whole episode.  Definitely a top 3 episode for sure!
“What kind of doctor are you?”  “… I am.”
Legendary episode
It's well known that redheads often have trouble being put under by anesthetics. I'm now wondering if they also tend to resist hot spices.
Conan has been my favorite late night host for a very long time and this may have solidified that for life😂 man was a real life Rick Sanchez in this!😭
Still with the socially distanced tables. So weird...
Conan rules. The best episode ever.
THIS WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!
Conan needs his own hot sauce, above The Last Dab!
That was epic!
Hardest I've laughed watching this show :D
*He's so obnoxious and self centered..*
That is a nice suede jacket.
Was so scared Conan gonna pour hot sauce in his eyes 😂😂😂
This will go down as a legendary episode
Conan such a g
Absolute class act, Im pretty sure wing pocket will forever be my best example of “through the dessert” I really did like Conan before, but its hard not to love him after this
OH MY GOODNESS>  His face is breaking out
I respect Conan so much. He’s literally my hero.
When hes going back to Haiti?
This was my favorite episode
21:07 my man went full Bullet Jack Dorso
Wow 😂😂😂
The Legend. Unbeatable. That's how you FEAST!
Wowwewow! That was amazing, thanks for the hard work mate.
Greatest episode. WHAT. A. SHOWMAN!!!!!
Oh wow, this was def the craziest show so far, man oh man!
the Dr was brilliant
7 years watching Hotones! Yet Conan o’Brien  and Steve O are the ONLY TWO who go above and beyond 1000% with hot Sauce
O'Brien's an ANIMAL....
BEST. EPISODE. EVER.
This was soooo much fun!!!!
Threw a like for Conan. A dislike for HBO "Max". But then another like for Conan because he's the best.
Conan is an inspirational
There should be an Emmy category for best interview show guest (if there isn’t already). I’d vote for Conan 100%.
Best Hot Ones EVER! Conan delivered 100%! First time I ever laughed so hard that I cried watching Hot Ones. Bravo Conan! Legend!
There is no better TV personality than the man himself. And Sean, if he says you're a good interviewer, it's more reliable than gospel.
Conan is awesome. So good.
I’m on break at work absolutely losing it lol wow, a legend
To be honest, I've watched more of Conan than I have of Hot Ones, but this particular episode is definitely my absolute favorite😂😂😂
Someone wipe his freaking mouth! Conan! So gross!! This was a fun one!
This is me at every wedding I've been to. Hero
😂😂😂
Hardest I’ve laughed on and the best episode By Far.  Conan has Nothing.  Still amazing!
Indomitable.
I have never been more impressed with a hot ones guest
Do you really need the double table now? If you were closer like the older episodes he would've physically been able to mess with you and it would've been funnier
The man is a legend! Best episode I have ever seen!
This is why Conan has always been and will always been one of my favorite celebs. What a legend.
This is the best Episode.... thats it.
Greatest episode ever. Hands down greatest guest I’ve seen. He helped host the show.
Best Guest on this show so far......
Probably the best one ever🔥💯.
Conan is freakin hilarious
I love Conan! 😂 Always makes me laugh.
😂love Conan
Please get Chloe Moretz on this. ❤
BEST EPISODE EVER! THANK YOU SO MUCH CONAN!
If this is the new thing we are done.
Conan slowly morphs into Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force over the course of this interview. Tell me I'm wrong.
This topped Gordon’s interview.
He who controls the spice, controls the universe
This is probably the funniest episode I've seen. I love Conan!
I like this Conar 😂😂😂
I love Conan.  You need to have him back on.  I was disappointed you didn't ask about Jordan, Sonya or his graduation speech at Dartmouth.
This frickin old man 😂😂😂😂😂😂 I love Conan
This video has the same energy of an intovert showing his new extrovert friend his hobby but ends up getting dragged around into his madness
This episode was straight fire.
Absolutely amazing.
Instant classic, hope it broke records
This just made my whole fkn week🙌🏻🤩
He's going to find those wing remains in like ... a year and a half ... and it's going to be an issue.
There’s no way any other episode before or after will top this one.
That was so funny I was screaming towards the end!
One of the best hot ones I have ever seen 😊
This is so.... sad :(
Conan has a superpower. He's a 61-year-old normal guy in good shape. But when the cameras are rolling, ready to capture his comedy, he gets an adrenaline pump so big that it gives him superhuman strength. Like in this "Hot Ones" episode. Or in the upcoming Max series where he did kickboxing in Thailand for two hours with 100% air humidity.
Instant classic
Feels like Conan was trying too hard.
The greatest Hot Ones episode of all time.
BEST. GUEST. EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kevin Nealon had it right, because I too am shocked and surprised that Conan made it this far in life, just ,wow. 😉
BEST GUEST EVER!!!
When the sauce starts go in the 7 digits, that’s where the fun starts
Best guest ever!
That was probably the most disgusting(visually) Hot Ones I've ever seen. Half chewed food on his face......
How many lines did he do?
its completely a coincidence that i'm watching this video on his birthday
how did he do it. Respect to him
Conan is very funny 😂
Is that the doctor from the simpsons
Conan is the dog in the burning room. "This is fine."
Doctor arroyo must have given conan some kind of numbing shots, or hit him with botox in the right place. That much sauce should put him in the dirt lol.
I love Conan so much
Hahaha, good lord 😂
Conan is a true comic world wonder. this was HILARIOUS
Imagine having the withiest man you can find eat super hot sauce
This guy is the only talk show host who seems real
Red- faced  Irishman rant  was  belly moving
that doctor looks legit with the stethoscope and all that
Use this comment as a "Conan should get to run Late Night again" button
the best episode of this show, thanks connan.
great interview i love Conan 👏🏻👏🏻
Legend
Conan to his secretary: Karen please bring a change of clothes for me to the show Karen: Why?  Conan: Oh you’ll see.
Geez conan my man ❤
Conan is the man
I think this called going for it. Please get him a napkin though.  Jerry Lewis  would have adored him.
Wow!
The message about being able to find comedy everywhere is great. It's like trying to find a new show/anime/movie to watch. You're not limited to just the last season or decade, there's plenty of great options from 20+ years ago too.
An era ended when Conan left the business. 😢
LEGEND
Best show ever! Nobody did the gauntlet like Conan ever, and nobody else ever will.
Conan O'Brien, greatest Hot Ones guest of all time
What people do for attention
You are a legend Conan.
Conan has and always will be a comedy GOD!!!
Conan for president
haven't laughed like this in most prob any other hot wings episode ... WOW Conan takes the crown this is pure insanity, comedy, I don't even know anymore ... Conan left a battlefield behind a piece of art you can't put a price on, WORTHLESS XD ... but in the good sense lol. Wow woW WHAAAW LOLOLOLOL!!!!
Sean has always tried to keep the pace with the guest…. But Conan blew him out of the water. XD love it.
This is the best one ever
The look of genuine fear and concern on Sean's face after the last wing is just the best thing ever.  Conan truly is the GOAT.
Conan still got it!
I was watching conan old remotes and saw this as a suggested video. Thought it was a video from years ago. Turns out to be a new video. nice.
good lord does Conan deliver
I laughed so hard I almost threw up on my lunch break
I was wheezing of laughter 🤣congratulations Sean this is hands down your best episode ever! 🍗🔥 and Conan you truly are a genius 🙌🏼
Conan has always ruled
Conan O'Brien is a BEAST!!!   ...and a consummate entertainer.
I like that he is interview and fellow talk show host
This was the best episode ever.
Dude went full Conan. Always go full Conan if you can handle that. So much respect 🫡
It is so hilarious to just slowly watch Conan deteriorate into madness
Hands down the best episode ever...
I don't watch his show, I think I never did but I know him and the kind of humor he manages. I was just interested in seeing him here and his interaction with Shawn, I love that he took the time to recognize Shawn's work and that he's very funny but you actually know when he's being serious.
A lot of Hot Ones episodes are hilarious. This is the first one that ever made me cry laughing. This has to be the best episode of all time (AT LEAST the best one yet).
When Conan opens Da Bomb bottle....oh please god no, don't do it my sweet prince....
I love how they gear the heat of the sauces to the guest, Alton Brown took on some serious heat compared to most of the guests
He took something.
Conan is undoubtedly the GOAT!!! 😂😂😂
Best guest so far and it's not even close
Well, that didn't go as I expected!
I love you Conan. I've been a fan ever since I first saw your show. Never in my life have I laughed this much. You are truly a blessing
best ever, Conan is a God
Conan is. CREEP
This was beautiful.
ghandi and popeye
19:14 absolutely broke me XD
Jeepers that was epic!!!!!!!😅
dude he didn't even cough
I wonder if this rant had anything to do with hot sauce or wings. What will the dancing monkey do next? How much of your soul are you willing to bear to entertain the masses? How far are you willing to go to keep us happy Conan. A bit concerning.
When's O'BRIEN going back to Haiti? I'd pay to watch that.
It’s so good to see a brand new “one of the greats” in Hot Ones. Absolute 10/10 interview. God protect Conan O’Brien 👏 👏 👏
Wait until it comes out at the other end.
I hope Conan is still with us. I know his brand of comedy isn’t for everyone. Put him in a time slot that has older viewers and they might not get it. But I’ve always enjoyed watching him.
u want craig ferguson
Shame you brought on a genocide enabler on the show.
Absolutely unhinged 😂😂😂 haven’t laughed like that since Bobby lee
Conan went Hamm. No one is going to surpass that victory
This is the most INTENSE interview of all time. Legit feels like two hosts going back and forth swapping the leaders baton.
Hot Sauce vs. ADHD
Kung Fu Panda. Lickety splity.
Towards the end I thought Conan's head was gonna explode.
Hey, champ, are you going back to Haiti?  Remember when you said it was so great?  Good times.          Putz.
It's a scientific fact that red heads have a higher pain threshold.  That was really hilarious though.
Local anesthesia?
Wish that dude still did the power rankings
This is truly frightening.
Conan is really a badass crazy guy, love his indestructible energy 😂
He had to have had that thing that coats the mouth so that you can’t taste things…. If not he is a badass! Now out the a..
Jesus!!!! Conan went beyond the limits of mankind
7 million views in 6 days. Conan gave this interview thought and delivered one of the best shows FWF has made.
Easily my favorite episode of all time.  absolute brilliance.
Hey @firstwefeast please tell conan this was the best show ever
Conan bringing the wings to analyse the sauce and find a  gig about it!😂😂😂
This is the best one I've seen😅
entertaining but the questions are so long-winded and ridiculous
🤘🤘🤘
"I said it and Gandhi said it. and Popeye."
commitment to the bit. Conan is simply a MASTER!!!!!
ahh ye ol pocket chicken
HAPPY  BIRTHDAY  DAY CONNEN O'❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I love how his face starts melting and yet the show goes on. A true entertainer
ITS CONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
He's the best and can handle spice - even better lols
19:14 - 20:00 20:26 - 20:48
I'm shocked he can keep up with the conversation. Most people really break at some point and can't retain what the guy said.
Steve-O has an insane act to follow up on. :D
We're raised on no spices but it turns out our bodies handle almost anything.
literally the funniest interview I've ever seen. I can't stop laughing
Legendary. Absolutely legendary.
Kids, just know one thing... back in the day, this wasn't unique. This was Tuesday.
Probably the only guest that totaly made the show his 🎉
Conan O'Brien , as famous as he was and is. He was underrated.
Was this episode during the covid era? Or is two tables instead of one the new thing for the show now?
Conan Obrien: Pure chaos, pure pain, legit great speech about comedy
Sometimes I think we are living in the darkest timeline, but then seeing an episode like THIS gives me hope that might just not be true. What an incredible episode, dare I say the best ever! Thank you Conan, and thank you Sean.
amaizng guest..... the best by far..... shawn never laughed his ash out...
He is out of his mind 🤣
This is literally the funniest video on the internet. Oh my god my entire body hurts from laughing
This was the best one yet!
Conan is HANDS DOWN, the funniest person who ever lived.  There are no challengers, never will be.  I almost peed myself when he was drinking from the hot sauce bottle.
Amazing
I'm not sure anyone's gonna top this
The best episode hands down.  Conan was so funny
😂😂😂😂
Well, that escalated quickly.  Awesome Episode!
so we just learned that Conan acts like a chicken but is actually tough as nails. Who would have thought?
I did not expect this episode to take the turn it did into straight insanity 😂
I love Conan so much
Maybe the best episode…unbelievable
Conan brought Dr. Nick Riviera with him.
This man cannot be stopped 😂
Now this is what you call a good episode
Conan is a true showman. He really delivers !!! bravoo Conan !!!
Legend ❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
If he is able to, please get Keanu Reeves on the show.
The last 5 minutes made me puke😂
if the views keeps going up. it could reach half a billion in a year. a rough estimation as of todays views 😅
I want to know how much he suffered after. NO WAY that didn't hurt later. 😂
THIS WAS AMAZING!!!!!!
No better way to close out this season then the high energy and and explosiveness that is Conan thank you
This has got to be the greatest episode of hot ones.
Hahahaha. Dude went home looking like a toddler who had been playing with their food
if i was that's commitment  i would be a billionaire
Conan is Goat
Madness 😂
Legend.
pobrecito ese tipo de golpes son perjudiciales quiza mas adulto sufra de artrosis de caderay necesite una protesis
What happened to guests finishing wings let alone taking more than 1 bite? Conan killed it! Right up the with Paul "Mac and Me" Rudd.
I really hope his pockets are lined with something because that's a nice looking jacket
Conan is a great comedian, and he was a mediocre host at best. He should have left that job even before the Leno-incident, and started other shows where he is in focus. His improvised bits are hilarious and he cannot hold a conversation. It's not too late... ;)
"I run a little cool" 😂
Did Conan go on this show and be like "F this, I'm gonna be the FWF GOAT"!?!?  Best episode!
Protect Conan at all cost!
Still waiting for a Matpat ep
I saw Conan on Murderville eating Sloppy Jalapenjoes so I have an idea how this will turn out 😂
How did the most Irish man do better with spice than the cocky DJ Khalid?!
This is my fourth time watching this entertaining and hilarious video. This video is the stuff of legends
The best show ever on hot ones
You need to have a follow along show called Hot Ones the aftermath to see what these people go through after having this much spice 😂😂😂😂
I'm waiting to see a guest dab each wing with the corresponding hot sauce.
Conan is pure entertainment.
This is the best hot ones episode yet
This is the most unhinged episode ever.
Did Conan pay a character actor to come on Hot Ones with him as Dr Arroyo? I would ask rhetorically 'who does that?' but I guess the answer is:  Conan O'Brien..
Best…..guest…..ever!!!!!
Last Dab? Conan blew the doors off of that.
the blut ar 17:34 was genius lol
What a legend. A wing drop interview indeed.
Honestly.......... Idk man, that was kind of hard to watch. Feel like Conan might be cracking up a little, or a lot. Hope he's ok.
Poor Dr Arroyo
This lad is off his rocker
Conan has a better head of hair than me and im 28 😂
When he talked about "making amends" with the buffalo I expected him to say "It tasted amazing." XD
Conan is.
Conan is king....and a fking lunatic...great viewing guys..😂
Best interview ever.
He's giving D.T. big time... he used to be funny
Usually high spice tolerance on this show is a little boring. Not today.
😂 dope interview
That was more like 120%
this is hands down the best gest ep ever lol! I laughed so hard!
protect this man
Awkward... but epic!
One of my favorite late night hosts with one of my current day youtube hosts. Match made in heaven
why conan  act like an idiot we will never know
this is the best
this is legendary
O'brien is probably the best talk show host. I love Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, but Conan is just so much more likeable.
By far one of the greatest episodes.. if not the greatest.  Conan, Awesome.. complete master..
CoCo is a Beast among wings
That's a wrap. Greatest episode of all time
That was insane, new found appreciation for Conan
This was the best
I binged Conan during lockdown. Can that be said about any other late night show? He did really try to make something memorable.
Secretly Conan puts 1oz of pepper extract in his coffee every morning.
I just realized that history by Conan would be fantastic
Sean is a pretty good interviewer like Conan. Rightfully, Conan has to be a great guest as Norm
Dude went on Da bomb like YOU are mine..F off and let me destroy you lol. One helluva interview with a cool dude.
That doctor looks nuts 😅
CONAN'S THE GOAT
No spice this guy has eaten all over the world multiple times😂
Wow
what a legend
I’ve always liked Conan. But… now I love him.
best episode ever
What a tour de force!
23:08 it looks like Conan just got done blowing the Cheetos man...
No way he didnt take an 8-ball of Columbia's finest straight to the brain before he walked on this set... haha hilarious...   He cant feel, cause he's a little numbed up.. haha
😂🔥🤘🏻🤘🏻
❤❤❤
WOW
For the record, Conan DIDN'T write the Chili Cookoff episode. So he didn't have a practice run at this.
One of the best episodes to date!!
Why can't I feel?
“BUT I’ll do a wing drop” 😂 Motherf*cker NAILED IT
This has gotta be one of the best Hot Ones interviews yet!
"Incredible" 😂
Conan for president and god and all things that matter.   He makes the world a better place
My brain refuses to believe that this happened.😂
Would have been funny to end the promotion at the end with “and nascar”
Max was his show's band leader... maybe that's why it rolls of the tongue? 🤔
Oh my God I am in tears lol
Conan is the definition of what drugs do to you.
❤😂😅😂❤
INsane
Conan is a legend in my eyes…
He understood the assignment! Conan is a genuine legend and true comedy gem.
This reminds me of the old Daffy Duck trick where he was like “I can only do this once!” Lol
Absolute beast😅
ugh... so American.
What an episode..man!
We got a winner folks. Conan won First we Feast.
This was awesome to watch!!
I am in stitches 😂😂😂
it's the most insane off the wall thing ive ever seen
Can we get a follow up interview about how the next day he hallucinated and peed in the baptismal font at Sunday Mass?
Love that Conan. What a character. Funniest one ever.
One of the nicest, most authentic people in showbiz. What you see is what you get with Conan, there's no put on, he's just a nut 😂😂
I absolutely love Conan O'Brien!!❤❤ the whole Finland loves this guy😂🇫🇮
Clearly the best hot ones I've ever seen. I love how Conan was like "this is part of the bit right?" and you're like "this is not a bit!" but then Conan showed you which person was correct.
WOW, this is the best episode ever :DDDDDDD
Out of all the late night talk show hosts Conan can't be beaten truly genuine
That was spectacular!!
This is the best episode of all of Hot Ones!
One of the best Hot Ones episodes ever!
Conan is comedy GOLD!❤❤❤❤
There are levels!
There's funny everywhere.. the most important takeaway
By far, this is the best episode of Hot Ones! Conan is an absolute GEM! 👌
I think Conan just won Hot Ones.
Conan was my kid crush I wasn’t allowed to stay up late but I would sneak to watch his late show 😂❤
Ladies and Gentlemen, that it what it means to be a professional.
He may be on something,
Conan is a national treasure.
Conan should go back to Haiti and show how safe it is for him. Old Barbecue will help him with his left wing delusions
Oh my. I could see Conan was perfectionist for what he does years ago. now he's artistically funny. Incredible and inspiring.
Heat is relative...this just proves that Conan is the hottest.
Love Conan, but he really made me worry here. Every time he would bite a wing I would think "Oh no, he's too committed to the bit, he's gonna bleed trough his eyes before this ends!" But he made it to the end and then some, the madman!
Absolutely legendary.
I said it and Ghandi said it.....🤣
ABSOLUTE LEGEND
Conan has always been king of late night and always will be in my books.
oh my gosh
sorry jeff goldblum, this is my favorite episode now
Now THAT'S performance art
This guy is insane🤣
Amazing Conan!💪💪💪💪💪
20:28 Conan casually slips in an explanation of his almost 30 years old gag, and it went over everyone’s head) as a Conan fan this is gold
Where did you go to medical school?  1998! Oh, I've been there!
Oh, My, God. The man. The legend. The comedy. I'm lost for words!
Just scream through the pain. That's Conans motto
Conan: "Come check my pulse." *Doctor checks pulse* Arroyo: "It's there." *Doctor leaves*  😂😂😂
I haven’t laughed this much in so long 😭
This dude had his tongue drench on lidocaine or something... there is no way an Irish descent can hold it like that
Best hot ones to date 😂
"I'm a physician."
Best one yet. We need Conan on again
Can we get Nardwuar
Sean finally got beat
This is a dream come true, but wheres Andy ?
so much self control! respect to this guy's acting!!
Bro chug down Hot sauce 😭 this is a first for the show and you are the 👑!
im going to repeat what i say to my child, "sometimes love, you just go too far and go too crazy and now im done. I think we all need to calm down"
What a plot twist, turns out Conan's family didn't serve bland food when he was a child, he just had the tongue of the gods able to withstand any level of spiciness without missing a beat.
Unhinged Conan is the best Conan!
CONANDO! the hip cut strings dance is one of my all time authentic natural dance move that Conan has mastered. 💪
I love it. I cannot believe you got Conan O'Brien on the show. David Letterman and Conan are my favorite talk show host. Also Jimmy Kimmel.😊
It’s only natural that you get Jordan Chalenski to come on the show next 😂
Bravo. Best episode to date!
He's next level dedicated
Conan is 83 but you wouldnt know it
Now I really wonder what a Norm MacDonald Hot Ones would have been like.
he didn't grow up in an Irish house, he grew up in an American one
By far the funniest episode.
This episode is too American, trying to be too much, and ends up being disgusting.
There is overdoing it. And then there is Conan-ing it.
Love it!
What a legend
I’ve seen other skits by Conan and I thought they were funny. I don’t really watch his show but here I didn’t find him that funny just loud (unpopular opinion I know don’t hate me) but props to him annihilating the wings!
the real conan the barbarian
Best guest. Best episode. Best humans.
Best episode EVER !!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That was brilliant Conan, I haven’t laughed that hard in a long while, thanks!!
By far the best episode yet.
O.M.F.G !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂
And that's how it's done! Conan! My all time hero!
Wing drop!
that's commitment showbiz 👏👏👏
I'm on the floor
Funniest episode in the history of Hot Ones. And inspiring. I lost it when the doctor checked Sean's tongue with the stethoscope. Tears still in my eyes as I write this.
“What’s wrong with me why can’t I feel!?” 💀 22:31
Conan. Absolute legend.
PLEASE HOT ONES!?  Get Conan’s Aftermath Thoughts?!  We NEED To Know IF He Had The Bad Shittzlz 💩 After The Show!!??? 🤯😱🤣🤌🏼
Is this because gingers don't feel pain?
This was a "Network" level monologue.
Watched Conans first appearance as late night host . He is still the same . Funny witty and chaotic. 😂
Conan is the GOAT of late night!
Is this a fieverdream?
This episode will become most loved and      most re-watched ever thanks to this incredible and spontaneous Irish guy
One of the best episode I've seen on this channel...
And to think this man graduated from Harvard
Max has been actively destroying their business since zasslov took over. I hope Conan takes as much money from them as he can before them shut him down.
Legend.
hpbd early conan!!!!!!
Savage
Now THIS is Hot Ones.
awesome
I have never burst out in laughing so hard as I did on this episode. This was beautiful, you could see Sean being impressed, inspired and entertained at the same time
Maybe ask 'Did you go to Epstein's Island?'
Conan just introduced the last sip to the show. Good luck to all the guests in the future😂
What a great interview. Thank you hot ones and conan.
Conan left Sean absolutely flabbergasted, just shows why he's a legend 🤣
Is he ok? Like he must have burned something in his GI tract.
I throughly enjoyed this interview 😂😂😂😂
"I am fine" he said without a white on his eyes
This was hilarious... 😂😂😂
I’m not even a big fan of Conan but 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼   BRAVO
20:30 that sound on 1.5 playback lol
Conan is living his life right now. 🤣
Conan could pass for a late 30 something, that's crazy.... I grew up watching him 30 years ago (past my bed time time haha) when most of his guests were up and coming models lol... he's awesome, glad he is still around!
RIP Conan 😂 maybe he’ll survive with a colostomy bag
I love Sean's ability to play off any type of guest as either a passive host or a very active host depending on the energy and personality of who he has without missing a beat. Conan is such an explosive energetic personality that I appreciate that he just let him go totally off instead of trying to match him for the spotlight.
This is why some of the best Simpsons seasons has episodes written by him. Though this could also be a Schwartzwelder bit tbh.
❤
Now we need a Jordan Schlansky episode.
Talking about Conan, Please bring on Arnold Schwarzenegger to your show. Dude is an iconaclly known actor, body builder, and was the governor of California. Known worldwide, I know I'm not the only one who wants to see his interview with you! Please make this happen
This show got more views in 5 days than any two late night shows combined! Crazy good for hot wings, sad for late night
Love you conan and i hope you can entertain people more and more in incoming years.
Someone please make Conan a movie villain
King Conan! I screamed out of excitement when I saw the title! I wish Andy was there as well.. or that he could have his own episode. Sona as well! All three of them! This ep was golden however. Fckn comedic genius, Conan is king.
Was it Schlansky who said “hop up on it!” ?
This is by far the absolutely most entertaining episode of hot ones I have ever seen! Conan has a lifetime fan in me moving forward
Good Lord. I want to live life like Conan does.
Great end to the season, instant classic.
Funniest one yet most definitely 🤣😂
He was trying way too hard. Unwatchable towards the end.
Conan O'Brien is exhibiting strong Bill O'Reilly energy here
Best episode yet. Conan is simply entertaining.
Truly the BEST epd so far. Conan is a god of comedy.
Bruh I’m 2 minutes in and already burst out into laughter seeing Conan put the chicken wing in his pocket!
Conan: *puts wings in his pocket*  Me: *papa franku putting ravioli in his shirt pocket flashbang*
Best hot ones yet!!!!
you landed the bligglest flish
That was historic
I have not laughed this hard in a long time. Thanks Conan :D
somebody cast Conan as the Joker already
conan is a funny and entertaining guy but i hate seeing food insisde his mouth and sauce smeared alll over his face and shirt lol
Haven’t laughed this hard in a long time! What a great man!! 😍
The funniest video I seen this year!
He’s going to have explosive diarrhea
Protect this man at all cost. Conan is a national treasure
I don't think that guy is a real doctor.
So good
Probably the most narcissistic annoying episode ever.  But props nonetheless.
I think I'll never ever get tired of watching Conan. Ever.
My jaw is on the floor!
conan is forever. he will never be outdated, unfunny, or irrelevant! he is a TRUE comedic legend!!!
Best episode of Hot Ones ever. Conan is the king.
20:50 Savage
Best one hands down, and Conan WILL regret it later if you know what I mean
Bringing conan into a conceptual show is like dangeling some candy above a child. He cant help himself.
Mad respect 😂
I’ve never thought that Conan was that funny. Fun guy, overrated. Comedy-wise I still think that. But you got to give the man credit for how we handle spice.
best hot ones so far
Bruh. The night will be brutal for him
The best one yet !
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Conan is a real pro and entertaining, but I've never found him really funny.
Conan O'Brien is a brilliant whirlwind.
Was that jumping  the shark?! Cause I'm not sure how you top that, lol?
I think I coughed and teared up just watching Conan eat the sauce
This is the best interview I have ever seen in my life
This deserves 1 million likes!
Conan got lip filler with Da Bomb lol
Glimpses of Robin Williams .
I'm surprised conan did not yell out for Sona to bring him some milk
Conan is cray cray... 😆
The bathroom experience the day after is going to be wild
Conan picked himself up some "Walkin' around Meat"
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This show needs to evolve and this episode proved it
Lame questions. The bald dude had said, "spicy questions"...really? Lamo.
I love Conen
9:38 - So is he saying it's worse than false sense of security? 16:29 - 😢 It's funny but also quite touching. He is right. Oh and playing it like that it's only showing respects to the other guests who were doing it with flat face or with a fit "mask".  I understand the regrets part... First time with spice? I say the eating isn't the worst part.  If they start studies on chili peppers and gut bacteria, and find it healthy, then I shall have these spices myself.  I scarred my hand as a kid with hot water, and it's a life long sleeve around my arm. I could have lost my face there, and some drops did get my face, and doc said that I might get bald spots in my future beard. Water does nothing to the pain, but makes it worse... I was a kid and no one knew what to do. I got to scream in the hospital multiple times, as they had to clean or wash it multiple times. I remember apologizing for that always before they carried me to the wash.  That's why I love "Keeping up appearance" and "Gintama" and Connan. 😢😢😢 Shame he's not on TV or fell out from tv channels that play here as his table changed I guess. I used to do my homework while the show played on TV and rest of the family went to sleep. Then I slept what I needed in school. Still got fine numbers. Now with epilepsy though so I had to shuffle my deck again.  These interviews can be so touching.
I keep forgetting how tall Conan is!
Conan did a show alright
Respect!! Conan gave it his all, that was everything 🤭🫡
I saw Conan live with Shaq once, I forget which year, maybe 2016 but I saw him live with my best friend and I never really paid too much attention to him but I was invited to go. Conan blew me away! I was laughing all the time with his jokes and just seeing this makes me respect him even more. The guy is a legend!
So happy Conan came on, just love him. Great to see him be challenge by the wings of death and nailed it!
He's the best
Man this made me miss Conans talk show. His skits were actually legendary and comedy gold. Im going to go rewatch them now
Conan's ride home must've been an absolute nightmare.
He ate ravenously for us. Honor him.
I want to know how Conan pulled up after the show. That would've been ALOT! 😅 What a show!
The king. Conan.
How could you not love Conan. Impossible
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Conan is pulling out his best comedy.
In this episode, Conan decides to eat the spices all Irishmen who ever lived missed out on.
16:16  Conan FKN ayyyyyyyyyyte - my gawd.
nuts, Conan is the most experienced electrician
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Conan definitely committed to the bit! Best guest ever!!
I cheered along in the end👏
This episode was a masterpiece
I've never been a fan of Conan, but props to him for this.
"you can't predict the future" says the guy who wrote for the Simpsons lol
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!
What showman
He drank it!!! hahahha
The GREATEST episode of Hot Ones EVER
Where did you go to school In 98  Ohh no 😂
Conan just isn't my cup of tea.
I'm going to say it right now. Conan had to have taken some drug to nullify the effects of the heat. Irish people cough up a lung eating something with too much black pepper. This Irish man just drank the hottest peppers out of the bottle with no effect. It doesn't make sense!🤣
Worst hot ones episode ever.
Conan is KING
I need to see that water buffalo vid sooo bad! Can’t believe it’s not on youtube
Conan proves he is made of fire and lives up to his bangs of flame.
Iconic wing  drop
Greatest Hot Ones guest ever!
The single greatest thing on the internet
Woooooow great one right here😅😅😅😂
GET THE NELK BOYS ON HERE!
That hot sauce transformed him into Lewis Black in the end.
I have to imagine Conan saw the face of god by the end... holy smokes
Conan is a crazy man who brings me much joy
how is not dead lol
MATPAT EVEN HAS YOUTUBE TO MAKE A VIDEO FOR HIS RETIREMENT BUT YOU GUYS ARE COWARDS FOR NOT SEEING THIS OPPORTUNITY!
This is the greatest interview that has ever been done, with anyone ever
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤️‍🔥
This is the best episode ever
Respect.
Easily the best episode ever
This is easily the best episode of hot ones I have ever watched!
TIL: I share a birthday with the least funny famous funny guy south of James Corden. Happy birthday to both of us, I guess; if it's not too late, I hope you get better at your job, Conan.  ...gotta say, though, that was a spectacular ending. Why aren't you always this on-point?
I love hot ones.. this is one of my favorites.. Conan is fckin awesome and hilarious
"There's funny everywhere." - Conan O'Brien
Insane. . .now have Andy on
WHAT AN FING ANIMAL! LOVE CONANS COMMITTMENT
Hands down one of the funniest interviews ever. Lets go Conan
That is a pro in action!
I think Conan O'Brien after watching this is a synth no doubt.
He last dabbed all of them😂
At first I thought he was referring to Max Weinberg.
Conan doesn't need to be funny aaaaall of the time. This kind of interview works really well with just the conversation between the guest and the host. There was no need for scripted behavior on the part of Conan here. We can appreciate that on countless other channels. This is not his show.
I'm from Argentina, and Conan IS THE BEST comedian. I love him so much haha
Im saying what everyone is thinking, you guys blew it on the wings this season. Gotta make em hotter right off the bat again!
21:00 Amazing.
Can you do adam from maroon 5? like adam levine gets marooned on the title lol
I laughed so hard, my eyes are watering, I think the whole neighborhood heard me wailing. Conan, I hope your you lips, face and innards are okay! I heard hot spice can give you a transcendent experience.this was both brilliant and disturbing in the best fun way. 🎉😂❤
Shawn looked genuinely concerned when Conan drank the last bottle.
Hope he's visiting Haiti
Why don’t people go for the milk. Water doesn’t work
I cannot stand people eating on tv! It’s gross! Buuuut…this is CONAN!
This has been the best show yet the man is an absolute legend 😂😂🤘🤘
Actually makes me question its authenticity. Bravo 🤌
Just wanted to say: Conan is awesome...
Best episode hands down.
The greatest Conan shows I ever saw was when Bill Burr was on.  There are several.  But those two together are comedy gold.  WAIT!!  Just noticed Conan and Burr wear the same jacket on First We Feast.  WTH is that all about??
Conan is the funniest human of all time.
Been waiting for this for a lifetime now, finally!!!! 2 absolute legends
I was just complaining to my wife that Hot Ones guest were getting wimpy and just taking nibbles.  Thank god for my hero Conan.  GET SOME!!!
so off-putting
Bro, Conan always Conan!
Today I learned I have the same birthday as Conan O’Brien
The more the heat kicks in the more Conan just dives straight into his bits. He literally hijacked the show and made it as if it was on his. Dude is Conan at every aspect, you are gonna get the best show with Conan every time
Best episode I’ve seen in a long time
It's like having to spare with Mike tyson
Watching Conan absolutely losing his sanity by the end of the interview is peak comedy.
hands down the best Hot Ones to date
Of all the videos i watched on this show, this is the best 😂
"Whatever I do I have to go 110%" "I know you got to commit to the bit" "IT'S NOT A BIT! THIS IS LIFE"
Best hot ones episode, no contest.
I wanna see Sarah Michelle Gellar on this show since she likes spicy stuff :)
Conan doesnt teach you about the country - he teaches you that people are people no matter where you travel and its so incredibly important
Coming into this, i was expecting another dj khaled situation. I've never been more happy to be proven wrong in my life.
Sean always tries to keep up with his guests while eating hot wings, like pouring the same amount of sauce on his wings or taking a similar proportion of bite to his wings. Thankfully, he didn't follow Conan here. It's impossible to keep up with Conan as he is so unpredictable.
The nips and all the extra sauce, oh my 😂😳
21:12 Baron Harkonnen energy
He is sweating and his eyes are full of water but he has great control.
One word: "Legend" We don't have access to his TV show in my country. But I've always loved to watch all those hilarious clips on Youtube!
This is the funniest Hot ones episode ever......😂
He did it again! Comedy GOLD. 😭😭😭👌🏼
For everytime i said "oh no" or "oh god why" I salute you Conan 😂
I'm curious about what happens with his wife when he gets home
Cement is one of three ingredients in concrete
Natural redheads are actually more impervious to pain. This is a medical fact. They also require more anesthesia.
He's lost his freakin mind. Lol! Great interview.
how does he still look 40 with a full head of hair and so fit for a 60 year old?
Conan has always been a committed genius, it shows here once again.  Talk about control!!
What a psychopath.
I love Conan 😢
If Taylor Swift is within the first 5 guests on Conan's show on Max then I'm about to get real sus of the release date
That was amazing
What an absolute legend Conan is. There is never a dull moment when he is on screen! Take a bow
That was the best one yet! Hilarious but it is Conan
Conan was the perfect late night show host, gazillion times better than this mооk Fallon.
I'm not one to usually think about cinematography, but the buildup from like 18:00 - 20:00 is fantastic. between the cuts and music it's surprisingly well done.
King of Hot Ones
Hilarious
I am humbled!
By far the best episode, oh my godd 😂
Do yourself a favour and pause at 18:31 🤣
Gotta be one of the best Hot Ones.. really.. kudos to Conan.. the ultimate barbarian..
Outstanding Conan O'Brien you must be from Texas am I fridge and pantry I have five kinds of sauces from the Asian the Chinese the Japanese and of course the local Louisiana and Mexican sauces and then there's jalapenos but that's a different story
Wow! One of the best episodes thus far!!👏👏 Conan IS show business 🎉
"what's wrong with me why can't I feel!" Lol I used to stay up as an early teen to watch Conan back in the late 90's early 2000's. I miss those days. This episode brought me back to that.
I ❤ Conan
I really hope Conan is alright!!!! Brilliant ... Love this one!!!
My face hurts from laughing/reacting to this. Conan really is the best lol
Conan o’boring
First episode where the guest has dominated the screentime 😂
Never knew about this channel until Conan ❤
They edited that and he threw up...no way he chugged all that hot sauce
Why are they 10ft apart?
Possibly the best episode of all time. Cheers Conan
There's no way that this will ever be topped. What a legend!
Ok, Conan has destroyed the show, and I'm loving it.  I'm not even a Conan fan, but this was epic in the scope of Hot Ones history... This is absolute gold.
Probably the best episode!! Love Conan so much. He went like a champ just to keep the bit going. So good!! A great way to end the season.
God I forgot how much I miss Conan I need more of him
"The Spice must flow!" I was waiting for his eyes to turn blue.
Hands down. The best Hot Ones I've ever watched. Conan will never be topped! lol
Hero 🔥
This is the day Sean realized it wasn't his show.
I'm sorry,  I have never liked Conan. Never thought he was funny at all. This doesn't change that. Kind of creepy but not funny. But maybe that is just me.
The doctor bit his hilarious
I don't see the point in making any more episodes now. This is the one.
If Conan has been chased for this interview for years, I respect him so much for how he made that chase worth it.  What a professional.
This whole episode was fantastic!
Conon is the greatest wing guest . It's worth the watch . Very funny and insane
This is one of my favorites😂
The only episode that can top this episode is a follow-up episode with Conan.
Off cam....Was he sick? Because that was stick!
Incredible
Conan is the Boss.
Best guest ever. I laughed so hard and, again, only guest to take over
Conan is the best 😂😂
Conan is a hot sauce gangster!
thanks for the laugh
❤☮️
I love how I felt he was hosting the whole show at this point
I haven’t genuinely laughed this hard to one of these interviews in a very long time- until this episode. Conan just changed the trajectory of these interviews , I hope the next guests are just as creative and themselves as him.
Second time watching this. This is so good.
Conan's head is 3 times the size of a normal human head.
😂 Conan O'Brien The energy of a showman and the body of a jester.😂
Conan just won Hot Ones.
Conan is the best.
Nothing about the Simpson?
ok, this is beyond the best Hot Ones ever.. Gordon.. you have a lot of work to do. come to think of it it's kind of Gordon Ramsay meets David Blaine on Hot Ones.
This is what a pure entertainer looks like. This episode was the very definition of 'committing to the bit'.
Conan is a baby at a table slapping soggy Cheerios around and squealing happily.
Don't even try to surpass this. In the distant future, when museums are just a bunch of old internet clips displayed on giant screens, this will be the crown jewel.
Sean love your show have you tried mint ? It takes away the hotness add a few leaves in the water jug
absolute beast!! much respect!
Jay Leno is not good enough to hold his jockstrap
I'm in tears...
Conan is a fkn LEGEND.
Conan ‘The Barbarian’ O’Brien is unbeatable. 😮  He needs a plaque award in his honor to give out to contestants because there’s no topping that. He is the hot ones HOF standard by a long shot. 1st ballad 🥵💦  Y’all got to post this again showing different camera angle with Sean eating and reaction. While we wait for next season.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is the funniest thing Ibhave ever seen!!!😂
Conan O’Brien is the smartest, funniest, most decent comedian I’ve seen in my lifetime. He brings the appropriate level of humor, inquisitiveness, and passion to what he does. Bravo Conan.
Conan O’Brien is so savage 😂😂 I loved how he looked at the end, like an Irish version of the Joker
Mother of god Conan is Legend!!!!!!!
LEGENDARY
When I first watched this, I thought "well, I guess this show no longer needs to even exist anymore because Conan has just gone SO HARD, so over the top, that literally no future guest will be able to act even so much as slightly uncomfortable while eating hot sauce without looking like a total feeb!"  Conan not only raised the bar, he raised it and then smashed it across his knee while cackling maniacally and tossing the broken pieces of bar over his shoulder. Full "commitment to the bit" indeed!  I don't think his performance even CAN be equalled without someone pouring hot sauce directly into their eye sockets while wearing underwear that has been liberally soaked in "The Bomb", all while also flawlessly out-singing Pavarotti's rendition of Nessun Dorma.
Wing Drop! 👊
Coco! Coco! Coco!
Epic 😂
Conan is the 🐐
Conan's talk shows were my favorite. Miss them so much.  Will definitely check out Must Go!
the best one to ever do it
America might be overvaluing super stardom. 😬
I'm only here for Conan and I'm glad to have watched the interview. Looking forward to the HBO Max show!
Fallon and Kimmel could never
I'm tellin ya, put a sugar bowl on the table.  When it gets hot, dip your finger in the sugar bowl then lay on tongue.   Works immeadiately filling those taste buds stopping the heat.  Thats why a lot of Mexican restaurants have hard candy bowl at the register.   :)
@firstwefeast I've loved watching all these episodes.  I've even fantasized about doing it myself(too bad I'm a nobody!).  This was hands down, the best episode.
Epic
This was all to intimidate Leno.
He is tripping on capsaicin. But Kevin Hart still takes it on intoxication factor. Thank you Conan.
First time I've seen Sean just give up asking questions. Lol.
This was amazing
Conan not only understood the assignment, he rewrote the rules
100% leprechaun ( based on DNA 🧬 test)🍀. So, does this mean leprechaun can handle their spice? 😊
Lol ahh classic Conan!!!!!❤❤❤❤
I love it . Conan is my favorite . That made my laugh so hard that I’m crying . That rarely happens
The fake doctor is the best part of this episode.
Conan looks like Elon musk sometimes 😂
Conan is an absolute beast.
Casually puts wing into the pocket of a $5000 coat
Conan is the KING😂
Conan felt like he was channeling Rick Sanchez at the end there...
Casually waiting for Flula Borg to be on ❤😂
21:07  reminds me of “yeah baby, yeaaah” - Austin powers 😂
CALL THE WIFE 😂😂😂💀
Goat.
That thumbnail already says it all. 🤣🤣
The transition between water to milk was clean
colbert is still on the air, but not that guy... welcome to the new woke america.
Someone call Conan and make sure he's okay.
Okay guys I’ve got a theory… Conan wrote many episodes of The Simpsons and one in particular where Homer drinks candle wax so he can withstand the the merciless peppers of quetzalacatenango and I think that’s what Conan did before this episode started.
He’s amazing, his podcast is PERFECT in every way.  Conan O’Brien is every bit a *professional* showman
quite possibly the funniest thing i have ever seen
Very good episode
Conan is a true comedian
5:31 " I'll remember these words Conan " Dang I hope you remembered Sean .... Conan Destroyed it 🎉 .... please 🙏  refer him as GOAT 🐐 From now on...
Conan is a once in a lifetime individual. Dude just killed the challenge all whilst killing the jokes, provide deep words of advice and answering every question in a coherent manner while his mouth was on fire. King of spice hands down👍
Its unbelievable that Conan drank from the Last Dab bottle.
Conan appealing to the youth
I laughed hard at this.
20:59 💀🤣...best ever season finale!
At the end of the day I feel like NBC made the right choice in bringing back Jay Leno... Nothing against Conan, but the goofy antics just isn't my humor. Jim Carrey in the other hand..
"What's wrong with me?! Why can't I feel?"That line killed me.
Definitely one of the best ever!!
Not the ripples Conan
Sean “THIS WHOLE SHOW IS A BIT” agree and getting hot  Conan “YES IT IS”  Period
Miss his show😢
My favourite episode by far. 😂
That was great
He was very careful to not leave any dna samples. Thats why he keeps putting the wings in his pocket
This makes Eric Andre look scripted.   Love you, Eric Andre. We know it’s still perfect.
It will never be topped.
Connan wins.  Nobody topping that.
probably my favorite episode
this was amazing. dream interview come true. would love to see scott aukerman next.
dude.
The best episode of all time, Conan is the Goat
In just 3 minutes Conan made me laugh harder than these other hacks on late night have over the last 10 years. Man he was the last good one 😂😂😂😂 miss him so much
Conan is completely different... The man is pure determination. Oh my goodness. I promise you he was feeling the pain and heat.. He ignored it. When he said "You people don't know what real danger is anymore"... That's exactly right. He sees it as a joke because he has pure mind over matter. My god. This guy is like a freaking Shaolin monk.
When that first bathroom break comes poor Conan will die
The best hot ones ever
The Three Stooges noises killed me
Conan is the GOAT!
Ok this one is #1 lol
❤❤❤
I wanna know how was the number 2?
I was here.
I started listening to his podcast half a year ago. I never realized how funny he is. Instant fan
And that's how Conan turn into a Super Saiyan 😂
Please get Larry David on this show!!!!
He's a madman I love it
see Conan O'Brien knows the line between eccentric and annoying..one of the most enjoyable episodes this season
Just another reason why Conan is the best to ever do it.
I’ll check it out because you did this Conan.
The visual gag of conan putting his bones in his pocket is so funny to me
"just feel for the pulse"  "its there"
Conan Obrien is to American TV like Jeremy Clarkson is to British TV
his hair got redder
Genuinely the hardest I've laughed in months
Conan is an alcoholic.
I feel lucky to have grown up being able to watch Conan he still makes me laugh like a kid
Conan make those bottles lost their pride
my stomach hurts from laughing XD, Conan is da bomb
I like Conan but man was that gross
I'm very sorry to release this information upon you but : Sean Evans looks like what would be just in the middle of the character creation slider between Jessie Pinkman and Ewan McGregor.
Conan is the only late night host that is worth rewatching.  He made every episode an episode of SNL.
Conan is the definition of comedic brilliance. We're so lucky to have him.
We love you Conan
Fcking love Conan. Every generation will have one..when he leaves this earth, a unique kind of comedy will go with him.  Enjoy him while he’s still here. 😊❤
“He is not a doctor. He is an affordable doctor” 🤣🤣🤣
Hot ones with Conan O’Brian and my next guest is Shawn with first we feast. Best episode ever. I’m telling everyone I know. Did us Irish folks proud 🤣😝😝
Man Conan has that Robin Williams style of humor in him that you don't see as much anymore. The line "This is the first time I've been hard in 15 years, CALL THE WIFE!" made my ribs hurt.
This was amazing.
Man, I love Conan.
Hopefully Conan doesn't need to take off his contacts at night.
Conan ate the water buffalo, didn't he? Probably with hot sauce.
Chappell Roan for next season pleeeease
Mr. O'Brien, you are a marvel.
this and gordon ramsey episode is my  favorite
He never touched Da Bomb....
comedy gold people
where do i get that jacket?
Conan killed it! I love this show in general, but this is definitely my new favorite episode.
This is by far the best guest ever!!! Great job Conan!!
In his podcast interview with Jim Downey, Conan said someone compared him to Daniel Plainview from There Will Be Blood. I feel like I can see that here 😂
CONAN= Hot Ones GOAT
I’m only watching this dumb show because conan
there is no way any guest will ever top conan 100/10
Pocket wings are sooooo back
i am concerned
That should have been the last Hot Ones ever made.  How are you going to follow that!?!  Conan! Conan! Conan!
"Annngh, it's not good." LOLLLLL
G.O.A.T.
Best episode ever!
Amazing show, I have a new appreciation for Conan.
Bruh... Absolutely legendary Hot Ones interview. Dethroned my previous favorite I legit can't even remember now. Certified G. I'm obligated to acknowledge one when I see one. We're truly not worthy. Rewatching as I take note what this G aka muthaf'in. C.O.B. is working on. Enough said. Wing drop.
This hurt me so bad. So incredibly bad.
Thisis the only episode I watched - then watched again immediately after.  Conan pushed himself to the limits, and unlike so many other comedians, had a reserve of gravitas to keep it relevant and sublimely entertaining.
Legend.
Two of the coolest people online. Conan is still killin’
The real Irishman, move over De Niro
Best episode ever 😂 Conan is the goat❤❤
Best first we feast episode... by far
I literally got annual subscriptions for max like 2 years ago when his new show on HBO max was announced
He was scary until "the change" lol😂
Conan is a beast. He's either the best actor ever, or has been hot wing training for years.
Conan is an absolute legend. You can tell he knows how to live life, I admire his ability to un-seriousify the stuff we take all too seriously.  Also I thought it was so awesome he mentioned the comedy that’s in the old & new testaments! Up until recently I didn’t realize just how funny the truths and histories of peoples in the Bible were & that God/Jesus has a sense of humor just like us. I mean it makes clear sense when ya actually think about it, if He’s our father of course we would have inherited our comedic genes from Him aha
conan is on test 100%
That doctor bit is hilarious 😂
Conan O'Brien: the Ultimate entertainer haha
HANDS DOWN, BEST EPISODE EVER!!!!!!!!
I dont watch this channel so I'm here to show love for Conan!
I'm going to get MAX and watch all 4 episodes, Conan certainly just earned that.
14:22 That man is masking incredible pain! And you’re laughing! Conan is legendary at that….
He said what’s wrong with me why can’t I feel? 😂😂😂😂 I love Conan
Sean and team, you're never, ever going to top this episode. I'm not sure how you can even move forward from here. good luck.
That was impressive. Conan you’re a savage. Well done sir
THE best Hot Ones episode of all time--Conan is the King of the Hot Wing! I had tears laughing so hard...
Living Legend, saw him live and saw him make the greatest university speech I ever heard in my life. Great show. ❤
"So, my question to you," as he drinks a bottle of hot sauce. I lost it there. 13:58
Came to see this episode looking for copper, and found pure gold. Man... I think this was the best episode so far. Sort of liked Conan before this, admire him now. Great show!
Jordan Schlansky, please. Would like to see him prepare his body in various ways and adequately accomplish eating wings.
My third time watching. This is the best for a number of reasons. Conan is a really nice guy, and he gives props to his people. But he didn't break a sweat, he knew what the mission was and he did amazing. His jokes were on point based on other interviews done. But I love how he paused his bit and said someone sincere and mentions that it's important. This was an awesome and entertaining show but it was also warm.
I knew this would be so good.  Conan is truly a gift to us all.
This is absolutely insanely good. People will reference this comedy, energy, and pure passion for years to come.
That was every bit as funny as I thought it was going to be😂😂😂 that was great! He has zero shame!
This guy is a MONSTER. smh LOL
Conan is one of the few that can make me laugh out loud.  Guy is just genuinely funny.
Best episode I've ever watched, and I've watched a bunch. Conan was the top guest of all time!
This is absolutely epic.
This is probably my 10th time watching this. I will watch this for decades to come. Great job
Absolute madman 🤣
Conan got Covid I think 😅
You have to do trailer park boys one day PLEASEEEE
Best Episode Ever! Crying laughing through the whole thing.
This episode is an instant Classic!! Conan is the man! No one else compares!! Well done! 💪💪👍👍
“My pockets getting full”
I feel bad for the next fuest who has to go after this man lol
Protect this man with your lives. One of the last real comedy hosts there are. <3
my god i love conan, a true showman
An absolute national treasure. We appreciate you Conan!
I really wouldnt want to be Conan the first bathroom after this show.... 🤣
I cried real tears laughing at this legend!!!! Classic episode!
Conan the winner of all time of this show!!
Best one ever!!!!
100% put a Numbing agent on his tongue....
CONAN WENT HARD!!! WILD!!!!!!!!!!
Absolute insanity.
I just want to point out that this man is an Aries
I stopped watching this like five minutes ago and I'm still laughing.
Conan the Barbarian owns it hard. Tour de force.
I like how at one point all of Conan’s bottles are up right and then they are all over turned and spilling out without seeing them fall over
I audibly applauded
This man just put a chicken wing in a jacket that costs more than my rent. Wild.
Conan's so hilarious bro 💀
The hotsauce rubbed on the face is unconscionable. This man has an evil inside of him that we can only pray is never loosed upon the world
best episode ever!  that had me laughing, way to go guys!
Goat of latenight.... EPICly over done but every bit halarious
When he started speaking with milk just pouring out of his face, I almost died.
I LOVE YOU CONANCO
this is the best one by far
Sean thought he was sitting down with a reasonable sane man. He clearly hadn't done enough research.
What a legend
LEGEND
Lame
Conan 2024 president😂
No ducking way! Conan your content is always 100% ❤ I give you top 10 yrs 😢not ready for that yet
I’ve heard him say that if something was going to be very painful but he thought it would be funny, he would do it for the bit. He really put his money where his mouth is. 😭
He has the bangs of a late 80s high-school girl
I feel like Conan Would be a very good Joker
This is what a naturally funny person is like.
Okay but why wasn't he sweating basically at all??
that was amazing!
Dude is crazy
That was probably one of the best ones
My favorite show…….😂
Hardest I’ve ever laughed from this show. Conan is a living legend
Love the Doctor bit 💀😂😂
conan is a mad man lol
That was magnificent showmanship from a consumate professional. Decades of brilliance with a distilled microcosm.
i dont think anyone will ever top Conan in the history of this show
This dude always makes me laugh period.
Conan is a great. 🧡 Give him his flowers.
C😍NAN
He's the best.
Absolutely legendary ..........
feral conan is something else.
Conan the Barbarian (2024)
Legend.
CONAN is the best! Love his podcast too
ford's! Conan!!!
@22:20 this is probably the only time i've seen Conan that close to panic
He’s the best BAR NONE
What a nut.
So is Conan the funniest person that ever lived or just the most consistant?
an absolute mad man
Conan always gives 100%
I haven't laughed this hard in a while , Conan is king .
@21:00, That extra sauce got him ZOOTED! 😂
I have watched Bits of this show but Conan had me watch the whole thing and enjoy him Greatly! 😂😂
He actually belittled da bomb spiritually
No! Freaking! Way!!!
OH MY GOD CONANNNNNNNN
He’s still fun
Literally  BEST HOT ONES ever!  That's ENTERTAINMENT right there. Great job Conan!
"Why can't I feel!?" LOL
I love Conan!
Was this the best Hot Ones ever?! Yes.
Epic.
If he keep going he would have been as orange as Trump 😂🤪.  Not one of your best guests that’s for sure too obnoxious to the point not funny.
It's great to see two professionals bouncing off each other and elevating each other.
he's so hot
THIS WAS EPIC!
I think this might be the best episode ever.
He Over did it but by far one of my favorite Episode so far
Now I want to see the water buffalo skit. 🐃   Happy Birthday Conan!!    Thanks for the laughs.
Conan never change 😂
23:51 this is a beautiful sight to see. dabomb completely violated.
Conan is a treasure
I love how he knows where the cameras are at all times and can look straight at the audience as he pleases
This was my ab workout for the week aahhahaha
Mad Props to Conan. I give him four more years to live.
So much respect for Conan!  Can't wait to watch the new show on Max!
Best episode ever
🤡
Is that Bill Burr's Jean Jackett?
The look of borderline horror on Sean's face after the last sauce was priceless. It was a "What have you done, you FOOL??!!" expression.
Sean Evans has the likeability of a nervous 14 year old in a math class they slept through. Conan has the likeability of a nice dad who wants to enjoy himself after all the work he's done. Sean needs to learn how to become more professional.
Cocan got little weird at the end… but that was still the best hot ones I’ve ever seen   10!
We need more professionals like Conan
For God's sake Conan, wipe your mouth.
test
Best guest on the show 👍. The guy is an experience.
The Conan with John Ritter and Ted Nugent was golden. Gonna find that on YT after watching this, lol.
Wow im so impressed I guess he does not feel anything
You rock Conan
What the actual fck! Amazing episode
I need Dr. Arroyo's contact information ASAP. That dude is one helluva doctor. The way he took Conan's pulse was pure perfection. I wish I had a doctor like that.
I know it wasnt on purpose, but Conan's glass of water turning into a glass of milk between cuts murdered me
power over Spice is power over all
the FERAL chewing 😂i love Conan
should of finished the interview by getting in his desk and drive away like back in the day lol
How has this not gotten the most views‽
I remember being a kid and my dad was a Leno mark . Always had some love for Conan. used to stay up late with my TV turned down low
By far my new favorite hot ones episode! Conan is a comedic genius, had me in tears the entire time😂
That one was unreal! 😂
Personally wanted to see who he was genuinely rather than his professional comic persona. Had Robin williams energy lol
possibly the most brilliant thing I have seen in a long long time
unbelieveable!! brilliance
Having recently visited Ireland and partaking of the "cuisine" I can confirm Conan's description as "tasteless" being 100% accurate lol.
Conan, looking at his face and eyes, is feeling pain. He's just pushing through it and hiding it. The Spartans would be proud.
conan is the goat
Conan is absolutely insane. 😬😳
I love Conan 🤣
goat
best hot wings ever
This is first time I've literally laughed out loud in a long time
holyshit conan is a legend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
almost 7m views just in 5 days ... i think this will be one of the biggest episode, hard to beat Gordon episode thou ...
Conan forever.
Conan, the best original late night host of all time!!!
🗣️His dry cleaner is going to notice wings in his jacket and will simply think it was just another weekend! 😏🙂‍↔️🤣
BEST GUEST EVER
Why do we love Conan O’Brien so much? Nobody knows. We just do.
I know this isnt a sport or competition but I think Conan just won at HOT ONES.
I think this show needs to expand to just one on one- maybe to pairs, like podcast teams like bobby lee & Khaylyla, or the Bad Friends etc
Best performer on the show?
the hotter it got the weirder Conan got lol
The BEST
Grew up irish, Oh man this is going to be a funny video
The funniest episode ever. "Why can't I feel???"
the fact that the host isn't reacting more strongly to Conan's shenanigans just make it look staged... even if it isn't
Outstanding.  Good questions and better answers!  Also, why is it so funny watching Conan drinking a glass of milk?
Worst episode ever. I knew it would be, all those late night hosts have the thickest layer of fake all over them. Even Hot Ones couldn't break through it. Dude came with jokes to tell, completely lost the idea of the show.   Perhaps their toughest cookie yet.
The best outro😂😂😂
It’s not good… best episode ever.
The goat😂
I only watch this to see how Conan OBrian hides The Bomb in his Jacket, just before it goes off :) After watching: Bro ... Conan killed it :)
This guy committed to this 100%. Completely shows why he’s a true legend of comedy.
"Im fine"
First We Feast got to big... So staged now... years ago this show was worth the watch.
I’m so happy the Conan episode has murdered every hot ones video from the last 6 months plus
This is the most hilarious insane hot one interview I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂
Conans' dedication to comedic crafing is legendary. He would do literally anything for a laugh.
Conan turns water into milk 17:18 - 17:28
He was the only talk show host I'd watch delicately. He never seemed faux or anything.  This might have to be one of the top 3 episodes
NO ONE has done Hot Ones better. And not “accidentally” funny. Conan is a true practitioner of funny.
This red head lady is funny ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm not sure that can be beaten! That was insane.
Conan is the only one who could pull it off the way he did. As soon as that 1st wing went into his pocket, he took the whole show with it!
conan is the best to ever do it
I love Coco! Been a fan since high school and I'm 47 now. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Just a legend 🙌
If, for some reason, you needed any proof that Conan O'Brien is the very best at what he does, this was it.
one of my childhood idols man this man has made me laugh so much all my life
Conan's right about HBO, whenever he says "MAX"  I immediately think "Oh cool  he's  working with Max Weinberg again".
Complete opposite of Gordon Ramsey
Conan, when are you coming to Chinches Bravas, San Juan del Río, Querétaro?
I watched this at 1.5x and i died
He wins best guest of the year 2024
RIP Conan. lol
I would love to know what was said by Sean and the Hot Ones crew when Conan left the building.
Dr Arroyo not the best but he’s affordable 🤣🤣🤣
conan is living prof the gingers are demons
Hilarious!!!😂😂😂
I adore Conan. Man is a national treasure.
Now I know Sean's real laugh @24:59
Conan took over the show completely. 🤣
Funny how even though most of the time Conan is doing a bit he comes across as one of the realest hosts
Quite Possibly The Best Hot Ones Episode or at least Top 10 Of All Time
Incredible
OH My God!!!! Conan set the bar so high..... I feel bad for any other guest that follows him on First we Feast!!!!
Conan is 1 of 1
How do you keep doing this show after that performance? That’s it, show’s over forever. There’s no topping that.
Crazy how little he reacted until the end. And the scene at the end was so funny.
Tables are still split?
When Conan mentioned Max I thought he meant Weinberg.
Wow!!! I'm impressed... And left a bit speechless. This absolutely did not turn out the way I thought it would. 👏 _<standing ovation>_ 👏
The background music makes this whole thing funnier 😂😂
This escalates so quickly
That was fuggin INCREDIBLE.... 😳
Mad Man!!!
Gawd dayum Cony, you dominated this episode
CONAN IS TOTALY AWSOME !!!!!!!!!!!
5:45 I heard "I think that's just coz you're meeting your idol." as "I think that's cause you have some meat in your eye ball." I'll see myself out now.
The top of my head started sweating on the last dab.
I'm beyond shocked at how much heat Conan handled. And he stayed engaged the whole time. I thought his red lips might have been bleeding lol. What an entertainer.
The look on Sean's face when Conan asks "Is it gonna hit me now, it's gotta hit me soon right?". I can't, he looks absolutely terrified. One of the funniest moments this show has ever had.
What edibles did he take before this shot
"He's the Captain Now...." he killed that.
Conan is wearing a very high dollar jean jacket, yet for the bit he stuffs the chicken bones in the pocket of that very expensive coat. It just goes against my Midwestern sensibilities.
Conan and Craig Ferguson were the last best to do it ❤
The doctor bit isn't really funny
Why is he saving the bones? lol So happy you got Conan on!
Conan > every other comedian
I’m so glad Conan is back
Great guest and a great show!
He is ALL that is MAN.
"You can't predict the future". Funny, coming from one of the writers from the Simpsons.
The best I've ever seen ! 🤣🤣👍😎
The difference between him at the beginning and at the end is dramatic
I really want both of their jackets!! 🔥 🔥 🔥
One of the funniest people on the planet, this was hilarious!
Lol I love conan
Conan is a comedy king!!
My wife and I love your directness and how real you are. Keep it up!
holy fing s! i have always loves conan I bet that show is going to be amazing I will 100% be watching that series😁😁😁😁
He set a new bar for "the last dab". If anyone wants to be taken seriously as the king of Hot Ones, they need to roll their chicken wing in it. Favorite moment by far. The man is the legend.
Conan is one of the smartest comedians, took control and destroyed the show, who can top this?
Conan probably were on frozen lake. There is only tundra in the most northern part of Finnish Lapland (arm's tip). 400km (or 250miles) away from the Arctic Circle.
Oh they must have a real doctor on set!?
Best episode yet!
So proud of him for not dieing after that
Conan is the closest living thing we have to Robin Williams, and that's the greatest possible compliment I can think to give a comedian.
Conan is genius
Is Conan going through a midlife crisis bro?
he manifested chris farley in this interview
For me, personally, this episode of "Hot Ones" is, by far, the greatest one I've yet to see.  Conan has now set the bar for others to strive for.  Numerous times throughout, I laughed my freakin' keister off like never before watching this show. 🤣
7:56
That was epic 😂😂😂

Conan is at a level all his own. Totally underrated and under appreciated. I hope he outlives me.
Conan is an absolute Mad Man!!! 😂
I never laughed so hard watching this show, him saying when will I feel it as his face is red with the veins popping out while sweating profusely. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow. What a legend. Unbelievable.
!GOAT!
PURE GOLD!!!!! He owned this episode.
Hands down best Hot Ones yet!
Conan is the TOUGHEST Hot Ones guest, AND repped for all the Irish people out there - take that    England and Gordon Ramsey!
Conan is the only celebrity I actually want to meet and be friends with
Best hot ones ever
The first half of this interview does not prepare you for the second
Crazy redheads
Conan is THE GOAT... THE ONE AND ONLY GOAT
Legend!!!!!!!!
Conan O'Bomb! 😤
This is one of the funniest things I have ever seen.
You cannot beat that performance. Conan is the Hot Ones undisputed champ. Best part though, if you know Conan, he totally did this so that the episode would turn out the absolute best it could be. Always the selfless performer 👏 Plus that sauce hallucination induced, "essence of comedy" rant at the end was incredible.
this is by far his best interview
Two legends. Conan is hands down the best comedian. Sean is a legend for eating all those hot wings every time.
This felt too close to a nervous breakdown for comfort.
I just love how this interview started fairly normal and then just became unhinged 😂
Scared of getting cloned and stealing the left overs
"The spice must flow"
what the heck
Is conan a robot?
New best guest ever.  Just a loon!  What a show man!
D best show ever!!!!!
Ive watched most of these, none have compared to Conan. I'm not even a big fan of his, but MY GOD was he made for this interview!
that is NOTTT a real doctor 😭😭
I remember when Conan visited Finland back in 06. Got to meet him in Helsinki and he was just a super cool person to be around He used to joke about him and our then president Tarja Halonen looking very similar
Legendary
Certified GOAT
Happy birthday April brother  Legend meets legend
this is intense,.  I'm totally here for it
Best epizode EVER
The best episode , change my mind
Absolute legendary show
I love Hot Ones.  I love Conan.  This made me smile.
love the dunking in "Max" lol dumbest rebrand out there
That was the best hot ones episode ever great job Conan
Someone save him from himself!
This has been my favorite guest on Hot Ones yet! I knew as soon as I seen Conan as a guest that I would be in for a good one. I was literally in tears from watching him and laughing so much 😂
He has blue eyes now??
22:25 Jesus 😮😮😮😮😮😮
And then there's DJ Khaled 😅
"Legend"
I saw his very first show ever. He was so nervous. It was actually charming.
That MAN just set the bar and it will never be beaten. Did he just become THE GOAT?
Probably my favourite hot ones episode 😂😂
Ok, actually, that bit where he talks about what to read is hands down the most inspiring rant I've so far heard this year. In fact, it was marvelous, and the best slapstick I've ever seen him do. I've often been O'Brien ambivalent, but it's times like these the scales get girthy in his favor.
Best episode to date.
Ladies and gentleman, the greatest possible episode in all of Hot Ones history. This is it! This is the PEAK.
This is hands down the best episode ever LOL!
Lisan al Gaib Conan the lord of Spice!
Hah, Conan is a fsckin madman. The bomb got him, as it does everyone, but he rocked it anyway.
I love conan
connon wild af
This is everything that’s absolutely outstanding about Conan O’Brien. His intelligence and empathy show through his absolute commitment to the “bit”, amid this excellent interview. Totally sharing! Thanks you, Conan.
The music is so annoying behind the interview
Not sure why he is so ok with it..doing extra dip with that bomb... first time i feel like rich people pay for a show...sorry .. i have personally bought tha bomb and my family tried it. Its not an easy melt. He is not getting any off it...???
This is the best video I have ever seen on the internet. Conan, I am speechless.
The best episode ever
I was expecting the doctor to be Jordan Schlansky 😂
I see Conan, I Like.
This is the best episode ever
This was the greatest Hot ones ever
Conan is my #1 favorite comedian of all time
He brought a person as a prop??
Conan smashed and obliterated the record of best Hot Ones show in zany, unpredictable and unprecedented ways that only Conan could pull-off. An absolute master of his craft!!👏 ✌️ 👏
Yo I'm dying 😂😂 Conan Legend Status
Greatest episode ever.
Conan is the GOAT
Did he just not ask an 8th or 9th question? 😂 Conan is on his best behavior I see.
I wonder if he coated his mouth with wax like Homer Simpson lol
Conon for Joker role
This is the best episode I've ever watched in my entire life and I've been watching since the beginning.
Conan is the definition of a Chaotic Aries ♈️ ✨️
That was the most unhinged episode I’ve ever seen and I loved every minute of it, probably my favourite episode
This will be an unpopular opinion, but this is the first I havent found conan funny, I just feel he was trying wayyyyy to hard to be all crazy (kind of like jack black always does)
Bravo, bravo!!!!!
This was incredible.  Conan is a legend.
Watching this episode, seeing two LEGENDS together and then seeing Sean front row at NAB a few hours ago was full circle for me.   Thank you everyone for bringing this series to our lives. Best episode ever!!!
King Conan. I have never been so serious,
Ohhhh my fricking god!! Best interview I ever watched, period!!! 😂
Conan had only become more unhinged as time has gone on. It's incredible lol
Conan looks like Gordon Ramsey in a fever dream.😂😂
This is one of the most beautiful things that I’ve ever witnessed. Bravo, Conan 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Conan is a comedy God 😂
Whose watching his televized funeral next week!?!?🖐🏾😶
Conan is a f beast! Love him
I seriously think conan should run for president. Unite the nation through silliness.
No fun when it's obviously scripted
No guest is gonna want to follow this episode. A+.
I have done the last dab. MUCH respect to Conan!
Conan used to be funny
the second he downed the bottle of hot sauce was when i started laughing really hard and did not stop
He should go to Haiti again.
This mf definitely ate a carolina reaper when he was in middle school
I feel like Conan came in here like "I WILL beat Gordon Ramsay as top spot"
What a Legend! Best episode ever
Only Conan can make eating wings look and feel like a Hollywood coke party
Epic Wing Drop
Conan is my man. Likes to let it all hang out.
What a show. Amazing way to finish the season. Could not have been better!!!
What is best in life? To pour out your hot sauce bottles, see them emptied before you, and to hear the laughter of their audience.
I’m definitely watching his show now!!😂😂😂😂
Conan, you had all of us rolling on the floor with laughter with this one, my cheeks hurt lol.
I haven't laughed for so long in quite a while
This is the best episode 😂😂
Amazing. Conan legend.
Conan is a beast.... period
For an irishman amazing!
Conan amazing entertainer!!!
poor conan sold his soul to the devil, it shows. he so tired :(
Conan O'Brien is my f'n hero!!!!
Conan can still make me laugh! Hes wild! Lol😂
FINALLY A GOOD GUEST! It's been awhile
Amazing. Just amazing
Starting to think Conan has some Chuck Norris looks in him
Best one yet!!! I love coco!!!
GOD,this was for me the greatest episode ever,i love conan so much XD
Is Conan ok?
I thought Conan, Kevin & Ice Cube eating wings would have been the best thing ever, but I was wrong.
I come back to rewatch this episode cuz it is sooooo freakin' good..
Just when you think Conan can't outdo himself, he does it again.
25:00 truth 🎉
I never thought they’d do a better episode then Ramsey but sir I stand corrected
ADHD 😂😂😂😂
youve done it. youve perfected the show. there is no topping this unfortuneately
I wonder why Conan doesn't have a Boston accent
Conan O'Brien the best entertainer of our lifetime, hands down.
BEST SHOW EVER!!!!
Conan is a Boss. He has no feelings. Love dat man.
Conan is a madman lol
All right next up Sona!
Wow Conan your awesome 😂
How did you feel the next morning Conan?
The best one so far!
Conan should be in the Christmas episode instead of gordon
And that is how you wrap a season.
Conan = 🐐
God, I love him. The perfect specimen.
This interview will go into the hall of fame. Conan nailed it 😂
22:31 me too, conan. me too.
Wow this was the most craziest but the most interesting episode there is!!!
What about doing a amateur season of interviews? John and Jane does off the street. Maybe make it a contest? I'm 48 years old at 6ft 7nches 350 plus lbs. I think it would be fun to be interviewed by this gentleman.  And that is what he is and his crew ... gentleman and ladies of course.  Fun to watch and pray for you and your team to succeed.  Bravo Zulu.
Conan is THE late night tv host!! One of the funniest guys om TV.. and a truly amazing dude. Team Coco all the way
Best. episode. ever.
More proof as to why Conan is the absolute GOAT 😂 I love that man
“Don’t hurt your body for the bit” *swigs hot sauce with dead eyes*
Quite possibly the most unhinged thing I've ever seen! Steve-O has a new target to beat!!!
ok. yeah, that was pretty cool. lol.
I know there's like 40k other comments already, but I just wanted to say this is probably the best episode.
Best episode ever !!!!!!! Mic drop 🎤
Conan is not human!!!!
What a great entertainer, host and comedian. Love Conan. Best greetings from Germany. Thanks for inviting him
Ironic, I grew up in an Irish catholic household and we love spice. We had hot sauce in every meal in some use
The King.
End sounded like Rick and morty ending
That was crazy 😂
This was amazing. Loved every minute.. also may have feared for his life a few times so I’m glad he’s survived it.
This is the best thing I've seen on the internet all year.
Tasteless food, shut up Conan. Don't perpetuate the lie that food in the British Islands is tasteless because it's not true.
Has he got essential tremor?
This is by far the best Hot Ones yet.
MIND BLOWNed!!!  Destroyed the wings, hot sauces and the table.  Never have I ever was scared for someone on this Show.
I have to say im no big fan of late night shows but I have to give big props to Conan O'brien for his showman ship. It was a great episode to watch and I might actually check out more from him.
Conan is my favorite human being of all time.
I don't find Conan funny at all. Not 1 muscle in my face moves
Bonus footage- Conan goes to the restroom!
According to science, Redheads have a higher tolerance for pain than the rest of the population.  I think Conan just proved it 😂
I badly want to iron Conan's face. Get all those creases out of his face
Im running a lil cool ❤❤ yes u are Conan. Love u
20:50  This is when Conan O'Brien madness starts! 🤣
Conan drank wax before this interview
what's with thatstupid elevator background music?
He's an ANIMAL!!!
this is how two year olds eat cheez-its
Favorite broadcaster ever 🐐💛
Easily the best episode of all time, and it’s not even close 😂
I dearly remember his episodes with Jordan Schlansky
Conan is a mad man and I love it 😂
This was the episode I've been waiting for and it was worth it.
Glad you all can experience my favourite celebrity of all time.  the funniest man ever
People think the chicken bones in the pocket is a comedic move, but i genuinely think Conan is paranoid about his DNA being left
Conan said he never had spice until he was 52, which was a year after hot ones started. He's been preparing!
One of the top guests for sure.
This was 🔥
Conan's head is so massive it feels like a camera trick lord-of-the-ring style to make Sean look like a tiny hobbit.
This was incredible, might be the best performance ever
That was insane hands down the best person to take on the wings of death 10000000%%%%%%
This is the best episode I’ve seen to date. Not surprised, either. 🤣
Save the most of the early wings and eat them later to control the heat for the hotter ones
He's kind of annoying...still. but as it applies to the show I think he is the new goat!
😂😂😂😂
Greatest episode ever.
WTH am I watching rn lol I come back to THIS episode!?! 😆😂🤣
Conan was high on hot sauce lol.  the crazy thing is that its true!!
0:16 0:17
I’ve been following Hot Ones for quite a while, I honestly think this was the funniest episode ever. Conan is an amazingly skilled comedian and interviewer, and Shawn is an a fantastic host and i interviewer himself.
Conan died on the way back to his home planet 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤣
This was the greatest episode they’ve ever produced!
Lets bring all these guys claiming they eat the hottest stuff with no reaction. Lets clean up the backyard and expose the fakes. Please and thank you.
There is 1000% no way that wasn't rigged.  He'd have 3rd degree burns on his skin.  LOL
After a bite or two it will be right back to his Irish household not tasting anything but flames and lava with a dribble of pain!
16:37
Conan is such an insane character! He's the best! Hot Ones should get Craig Ferguson on next!
Been riding Conan's antic's since his Simpsons Days!! Never change man!!
"Max, that really rolls off the tongue doesn't it?" Hope Max Weinberg isn't watching this.
No one is ever ever going to touch u on this Conan... Absolutely Epic
I was yelling "NOOOO COCO !!!!!!!!! " when he did that to the Bomb.... I thought I was tuff but the Bomb is no joke... had me pouring soy milk all over my face just off one wing lol... COCO I love you!!
Okay so I'm like Andy.  Does No Comment count?
Yeah that’s never getting topped ever.
Conan totally morphed into Louis Black in last in the few minutes!
really really gross, unfunny and disgusting
My fav moment: seeing Sean question his life choices after watching Conan guzzle Da Bomb.
Iconic, this is the best hot ones of all time. Good luck beating that. On a side note I wouldn't mind want to be Conan's innards the day after.
You could only finish the season with Conan... Imagine following this performance my god
What a legend. Dude sips the hottest sauces and proceeds to drop the most eloquent gems. “There’s comedy in the Old Testament, there is comedy in the New Testament..” amazing.
Sooooooo excited for Conan!!!!! He suffered with amazing style!!! Have him commit Joel Mchale and Timothy Olyphant!!!!!!! Great friends of his! And funny guys Lol😅😅😅😅😅
Generations will tell their young of the day a living legend became A GOD.
Conan you are the best :D!!!!!
Conan is a genius. Love him!
Savage!! 😅
Hot Ones with CONAN O'BRIEN; with guest, actual host of show, Sean Evans LOL
This was amazing LOL!!!!!
What a beast.
Its conans lookalike 😂
Wow… this took me back to late nineties staying up late during school vacation nights to see Conan.   What an absolute Genius!
No spice in an Irish household except for salt. My Irish father didn’t eat anything without loads of salt.
Conan deserves his own insanity sauce after this commitment! All HAIL the king of late night!
Conan is a COMEDY GOD. To say anything less is blasphemous at this point. In fact, I  just sacrificed a water buffalo in his honor.
Now that's how u eat ur hot wings with hot sauce. Conan, i love you, Since forever. U are truly the Legend. Hail to you. ❤❤❤❤
Anyone who is a fan of conan knows he will do annnnything for a laugh
honestly coco forever lol. also i have never had anxiety watching this until today lol
"I grew up in an Irish house in Boston" no you grew up in a house in Boston. If someone said "I grew up in a Bostonian house in Ireland", that sounds ridiculous doesn't it? And for god's sake lose the quiff!
Conan is hilarious. He could play a Young Trump. 😂
CONAN IS A GOAT! 🐐
I hope it's possible for youtube shows to win an emmy.
This might be Conan's Magnum Opus.
Jajajaja you can see it in his eyes! 😂 amazing. But spice is not to play around in that amounts. A lot of people have died to excite your nervous system that much.
"you're not a doctor, are you? I should be." - I died
the amount of EDITING THIS "bit" went though is unreal... thats the real spice
It looks like he ran his figures through Trump’s hair!
jesus christ. this episode is the craziest one i’ve seen.
Conan gave everyone the cheat sheet for the show. If your level of being unhinged is greater than the hot sauces scoville unit, you can beat the hot sauce EVERY TIME!
Conan is inarguably one of the greatest comic writers/hosts of our time - - You can see his craft in this entire interview. You can see how he sets up for a very clear "The wheels have come off" moment at the end, where he looks crazed, drooling, and wielding a sauce bottle; waving it around like a scepter while he speaks about being "well read" - - - Contrasting so strongly to the composed start he had, when he challenged that no sauce would affect him as we slowly watch him descend to that end-state. He's truly a master of the craft of making others laugh.
It's that redhead gene
i can only imagine the animal handlers saying “i told you so!!” after the water buffalo
Either Conan bribed someone to replace the sauces, or he's more macho that I will ever be.
Can someone please tell me why [insert anything bad happened to Conan] from [insert here a name of a company or a person] ?
I don't know if I have a bad humor sense but I didn't laugh not even one time... :(
All of it. If this isn’t my favorite episode yet then it’s top 5 hands down.
THIS WAS , IS , WILL BE THE ..THEEEE 🎤  DROP OF AAAL TIME ON HOT WINGS, CONAN the goat....THEEE GOAT 🐐 !!!! Wau... just wau ev3n Sean didnt know what to do xD he was stunned to oblivion xD  Wau Conan Wau Bravo, THIS is called A SHOW!!!! All other Hot wings PALE in comparison!
Señor Conando tiene grandes huevos
Yeah he the goat
Do we think Conan was delirious or genius to make up how President Harding died?? Lol
Forgot how tall conan was
literally the best one ever love you conan
Evan found his master. Graduated at Conan College 😂
And that's show business
Im gonna subscribe to Max now
I wish Ice spice had went this hard lol This is pure commitment and awesomeness. LOL
i did not expect this at all MY GOD??
just have conan on every season
One of the best moments in comedy!! Hands down!!!
I think he had some nose beers before the interview😂
He did not disappoint! Hilarious!!
Conan expressed so much of the moment. Post Corona. Everyone of us were there. Something a pillow with a lot of cars couldn't handle.
Conan is the best host ever. Love his conan without borders show.
Goat guest
Hands down the best episode.
thats actually crazy that he covered the wing with the most spiciest sauce then ate mostly all of it. The proceeded to take a swig of it. Then does not even react that much to the spiciest one. Big kudos.
The fact that Conan was willing to risk a possible trip to the ER and an emergency "analectomy," just for laughs...?  "We're not worthy!"
The Hot Ones GOAT!!!!!
Just when I unsubbed, they drop this bomb 💣
No one will ever top Conan on Hot Ones….  NO ONE…….
When he destroyed Da Bomb I almost lost it. I've had that and it's just nasty. No flavor, just chemical hotness. New respect for Conan
I swear his soul was about to leave his body a couple times. 😆
That must have hit harder than the adrenochrome he probably takes.
I always loved Conan until his "Haiti is already great" stunt
Brought to you by painkillers.
Conan is a national treasure.
I have the same doctor. Crazy
Watching Conan with the final sauce was like being Walter White yelling from the back of the car.
❤❤
At the end, I couldn't stop laughing at Conan Sanchez 🤣
This was probably the best episode i have ever watched. Absolutely fantastic!!!
I feel like I need a follow up to this show. The aftermath of all that spicy comedy.
“Are you a doctor?” “I should be…”  Historic
This is historical and will be the most iconic Hot Ones ever.  Don't even try to contest this fact.
This is easily one of the best interviews. When Conan started pouring on the Da Bomb.. The "I'm not gonna lie" line was so perfectly timed
8:11 COUGH COUGH ELLEN
I wouldn’t even want get on the show anymore after watching Conan Destroy! This was Legend
best episode ever. by far. end it now.
I don't think he's doctor. 😂
My god, what an absolute legend. Thanks Conan
Man im starting to think this Conan guy might be funny.
The worst show this year. Right up there with the show with Shaq. This guy is a real POS.
😂😂😂
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL 😂❤
This guy is a badass.
Amazing performance mad respect!!!
In the Year 2000! 🎶🔦😮🎵
At the end Conan looks like  Bryan Cranston being set on fire and simultaneously being electrocuted.
This is so gross!!! I couldn't watch, lol!
Flipping love this I imagined this is how I’d do it and Conan beat me to it!!!
Legendary episode for sure. Conan is crazy!
He’s still the best. This man understands entertainment
Love conan 😂
Easily the best hot ones episode ever
You can tell how inexpensive that doctor is.
Oh My Fn G! Conan the ultimate interview.  Kinda feels like the closest thing we would get to a Farley interview too. 😂
i think he just over did it a bit , it got boring how much he is screaming . smh
Sean looks like DeNiro watching Walken play Russian roulette in the Deer Hunter
What a legend
This is a petition for Conan to play the Joker. Comon WB before it's too late, that will the most chaiotic version ever.
Epic, best hot ones yet, just when I thought I'd already seen the best. OH YEAH!
Never been much of a Conan fan but he was brilliant here.
I think Conan drank candle wax before this shoot
What a madman
The last great talk show host strikes again
You need to try and get Nardwuar on the show. that would be badass,  then you can ask him how to trick members of slipknot to break character like he did to #3.
22:30 I would love to play that to Conan the day after, sitting at the toilet... :D  He is one of a kind. True master of comedy. You just can't but love and respect the guy.
Love Conan 😂
the GOAT himself did the honors.
Straight gold
are the wings hot or not? Conan:  whichever is funnier
Wow
too funny 😂
Our generation's Charlie Chaplain. Pure gold, but with a pure soul as well.
Romans 10:9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
I love Conan so much more 🤣🤣🤣🤣
What a warrior, he destroyed all those wings and bottles 😂
This man is seriously a national treasure. There's nobody else like him, love Conan
Long live Conan
“What’s wrong me? Why can’t I feel???” 😂😂😂 Conan is the best episode of hot ones
all that conan needed to do was pour the nuclear hot sauce in his eyeballs
what an amazing episode LOL
I thought this was bruce jenner😂
This was the funniest hot ones I’ve seen 🤣🤣
Been watching since s1, and this might be my new fav ep
This has to be the best Hot Ones episode of all time.
bro how?!?!?!?! hahahahahaha
I vote this as the best episode of hot ones yet!  Conan the Barbarian!
He s either made of vibranium or true pro !!😅 What a legend!  He is going to regret going full trottle like that when going to the toilet thou!
Great episode ❤🫡
Short story: I just watched comedic history be made.  This is the epitome of hot ones, and probably the single best performance I've seen from Conan ever (and I've seen a lot). My god, that was impressive on all counts; Sean keeping his composure and flowing with his guest even though the guest in this case completely took control of the show, conan devouring the hot wings in a strong and steady escalation that didn't seem to have an end, and Conan's constant comical quickness. Amazing. Truly.
As a spice lover this was the most hilarious and entertaining 30 minutes in a long time 😂😂😂👍
THE BEST EPISODE EVER! wow
Wow, the best guest ever! And also truly the best amongst the late night show hosts.
Conan is a G.O.A.T. & not only on "Hot Ones ".
This was fvcking hilarious. What a legend!
How is this the 20th time I’ve seen this in the past few days? 😅
Rumors he held it together well for the show and then went home and cried for the next 3 days
I loved Conan he was actually funny all we left with now are communist mouthpieces.
11:07 lots of real emotion here from Conan, you can hear it at 11:17 he had to snap out of it, I couldn't imagine how mentally demanding doing some of this improv is. Conan we appreciate you and your strive to entertain the masses brother. <3
Never seen any guest Masterclass this show like Conan. Wouldnt expect anything less from Legend Conan. Dude drank The last Dab and pouring Da Bomb all over that wing & maintained composure througout. Crazy. He smashed this 💯
Best one I’ve seen on hot ones. Conan is such an entertainer.
Why is there music?
Never wanted to like a video more than once except for this one
HAHAAHAHAAHAH,  you guys are still sitting 6ft Apart?
so that's why Bea Arthur's last words were " Conan was right ! "
Them using this as a reaction factory is repulsive
7:15 Conan O’Brian low key offering Sean a job
Pure unfiltered entertainment. goat
King of Latenight TV
Wing drop
That was unhinged and I'm all for it!
Conan owned the show and gave a wonderful comment to Shawn who is one of the best interviewers ever! Well done!
Jesus
Was it a 4-year medical school? "It was... supposed to be." hahaha I'm using that line next time I'm asked that question.
"I grew up in an Irish house" He's gonna say somewhere in America isn't he..."In Boston" YEEEEEEEP...Irish houses are in Ireland my guy.
Conan has been in media SO LONG that you forget about him for a bit, then see him somewhere like hot ones and remember how much he rules
Conans the new host of this show
13 mil sub but only 400k likes? what gives.
doctor arroyo could 100% be a fred armisen role
One of THE best episodes ever! Long live Conan!!!!
this has got to be the best hot ones episode i've ever seen, conan is so over the top!
Awesome 😂 love Conan he's easily funnier than ever
Conan is one of the only comics that literally brings me to tears of laughter. BEST EPISODE EVER🔥🔥🔥😭
Conan licking hot sauce, I definitely didn't see that coming!
ONE EPIC EPISODE ❤ CONAN❤
Conan is a machine! How does he survive this run !? He is so funny and crazy! Nothing can stop him!!
It’s so funny watching this a second time….how Conan starts this so calm and earnest (and subtly funny)…..then just slowly builds the craziness until he’s jn complete control; and has turned into a stark-raving mad hot sauce zombie
Conan needs help 🤣
Conan is on another level!
2:20 Conan putting the wing in his pocket is so fkn funny
Camera Guy Bill should check out Diet Guy Bill.
He is the legend who stood many different decades
Conan has given me the biggest laughs during some of the hardest times. Nothing but ❤ for Conan!
Conan has set a new bar for this show. He just BOSSED these wings like no other guest.
Actually cried laughing on this one my god 😂
I YAM WHO I YAM
please get Timothee Chalamet on next 😎
we need Shane Gillis!
Without viewing i can tell this is my favourite episode already. But now it's time to watch this thing
We have come a long way from DJ Khaled.
It seems like Conan needs to cool it down with some milk.
I love Conan! I really needed to laugh this hard during his final rant!
wow, the madman, he almost killed Sean at the end, who was trying to keep up with him with the sauces!
Conan O'Brien is a true legend of comedy! This was the best episode of Hot Ones yet! Couldn't of ended this season any better!!!
Sean is still trying to figure out where he stopped being the host and Conan took over.
I expected this one to be over the top a bit and boy i was not disappointed lol.
Best show ever!
great show
That doctor and them saying where lol 😂
Goat
I’ve seen almost every episode and I don’t think I’ve ever ever seen Shawn laugh this hard during one of his interviews. What a great way to send off the season.
this is straight up inspiring
He's naturally funny! 😂
Conan is a Freakin Legend!!!
Amazing, incredible, the best Hot Ones ever. This shows why he was hosting for 3 decades.
What a great season topper! Conan is an awesome guest!
Conan is so funny
Conan is one of the GOATS of late night talk show comedy
0:32 "When the world needs help, he came instead" I DIED reading that😂
what an incredible episode, truly!
That was probably the best episode yet
We laugh, but this had all the weight and delivery of something momentous, and never to be replicated. The level of commitment was just top tier. Maybe it was the music.
Hands down the most unhinged episode of all time
For my money the funniest entertainer of all time
😂😂😂😂
Looking like Norm eating those chicken legs
Love you conan.
Wow… whole new level of respect for Conan.
this might be the best one yet
That is the hardest I have laughed in a very long time. Thank you.
Best episode ever!!! That was just a great time!😂😂😂
This is, without a doubt, the best episode of Hot Ones to ever air. Bravo.
Outstanding bravo
I think I can hear Sona’s laugh around the 13:40 mark 😂
Comedy legend, nay comedy god!
More guests like Conan please! One of the best episodes!
That was awesome
Call the wife
6:00 I have wanted to ask this question for so long!!!!
What a legend.
I saw Conan in Ireland in a town called Redcross, I was driving through and spotted him filming his show. I still regret not stopping and trying to say hi...or even shouting something from the car
by far the best episode ever.
Bea Arthur noooo
Remember when late night wasn't full of propagandists? Pepperidge Farms remembers
By far, HANDS DOWN, the best episode yet. Conan SLAUGHTERED
He catched a high 😂😂😂
This was far and away the best episode I've ever seen.
Im horrible with spice   Easily get through wings and mocks them for comedy   Might have been the funniest guest ever
The greatest episode of all time.
Conan is a performer dude 😂😂
"It's there"..😂😂😂
This is the best episode ever
Conan is one the GOATs🐐 interviewer on TV and for him to give such a compliment is cool of him
Truly incredible interview. Conan is one of the best to ever do it
This was a work of comedic art!
Conan O'Brien Killed Bee Arthur !?
I LOVE CONAN
The only question here is... who did Conan knock out of the top 10 greatest guests?
Why the music? It's completely inappropriate.
Epic episode
My favorite guest so far 😂 Amazing
Is his face actively blistering at the end? Lol
Nothing is funnier than Conan doing a crazy rant, grimacing into the vacuum, slightly crossed-eyed, and turning red.
Legend , best one I've seen in a while
My favorite part is Conan telling that water buffalo story and how reckless that was. Cut to five minutes later and he’s dousing his wing with DaBomb😂😂😂😂
This is the greatest episode of the greatest talk show of the current time. Knowing that Conan would be the guest, I didn't expect much less.
Legend. . .
were there updates on his status 2, 4, 10 hours later? Surrounding myself with many Boston Irish dudes and their moms and their cuisine, i have concern for his GI after the adrenaline wore off
A champion Conan is
😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
O oh my god lol
Conan is a LEGEND!
Best guest ever
That's up there with the best! Conan is a beast!
Respect. Hats off to Conan. Love this interview.
Being a person who was raised on Carson and early Letterman, I never liked Conan. He never knew when to stop a joke. We wears things out quickly. Conan is a great example of settling for what's there instead of demanding better. Sadly, he paved the way for Fallon and the list of dead weight that's hosting today.
Legend
Jesus, talk about a tour de force!
So those tasteless years in an Irish household really killed Conan's taste buds, he can't feel a thing 🤣
How can you not like Conan he is great
Gosh his Irish spirit is showing
Alright, you’ve convinced me. I’ll check out your show Conan
Is Conan secretly a nurgle worshipper? :D
Hands down the best episode!!!
Wow! Incredible
This guy is the GOAT. Team Coco forever
I feel this episode perfectly epitomises the difference between American and British humour. All of the comments from Americans are spouting what a comedic masterclass this was, whereas I found it cringey and contrived.   I guess this is why American late night talk shows, SNL etc. have never been popular in the UK. This was so scripted and rehearsed, whereas British humour is more ad hoc and impromptu.
I have to say as someone who’s been a hot ones show since season 1, this has to be the greatest episode ever
Getting that much praise from Conan... that's gonna go right to Sean's head
Brb, going to Google if he has passed away since this recording
Hands down probably one of the best episodes to date !
I don’t think I’ve seen a guest take Sean so much out of his rhythm that he forgets to ask a question (Wing 9 for my fellow nerds keeping track). Conan is GOD!!
Conan turned into Lewis Black.
THIS. IS. LEGENDARY.
Best hot ones episode I've ever watched haha
Paid maternity leave does nothing for employers but keep our country populated with future young employees.
Where can I petition to have the Water Buffalo tape released?
I guess he never developed spice receptors in that bland household he was raised in? 🙃 truly inspirational, nonetheless ❤
Conan wins. Best episode ever
@ 23:00 when Conan started to turn into a Chilli Zombie 🌶 🧟‍♂️
What a god!
14:00 I have no words, this man is a living tornado of chaos
I didn't realize how unfunny Conan is when he doesn't have writers.  Jesus christ he bombs.
Best ever!🤣🤣🤣
This was just mental.
That video title is so misleading, I actually thought he needed the doctor but this brother is drinking sauce like no tommorow
Idk I know he's got a lot of fans, I don't watch him, and I feel like he's just trying too hard.
for a second after the last dap i thought, ok we now see him gonna die
This has got to be one of the funnies Hot Ones out there
Conan died on the sauce for our grins
Tell me Conan is not the funniest comedian alive right now😂😂😂
This may have been the best one??!?!!
i just realized robin williams wouldve been a great guest
BRAVO BRAVO BEAUTIFUL
DaBomb gets us all
Absolutely funny! Nailed it
Greatest 28 minutes of my life , not even joking.
Try and top that episode.
I promise you... I don't laugh out loud very easily. I love good humor, but I don't express it on my face. Conan here got me hysterical, the way he committed to the humor SO DEEP, beyond anything that would have been expected of him. I have a totally new perspective on this guy, what a mensch.
Too bad that was staged. No way O'Brien's sauces were the real thing. What a huge load of BS just to promote his new podcast or whatever.
Hahahaha, never had such amount of laughs nor expected to. I literally cried laughing. ps: For the rest of the world 26:35 "Football" and catches it with his hands 🤣😆
Conan is the goat !!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
hands down the most entertaining episode. well done.
He might need a real doctor after this. I have never seen a person turn entirely red. Skin, eyes, hair, everything.
I have no words
20:51... he came so close to shove a finger full of pure pepper in his eye, this guys is mental
Conan is a Champ. What he achieved in this video will be very difficult and near impossible to surpass.
I hope he talks about this on his podcast…I can’t wait to see how Sona reacts.
He committed to entertaining all of us..this guy 😂💀
16:52
watching even the most confident and strong guests hit Da Bomb makes you realise why it's been a staple on this show, unchanged, for so long..
I never felt that man is funny
Well I knew Conan may not always look the part, but he is a hard mf. Well now, once again proved it! 💪😎🤘🔥🔥🔥
Wow! I was not interested in watching Conan at first. HOWEVER, I decided to give it a chance today, and IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT!  What a fantastic episode. I enjoyed every second of it. Conan committed to it and spilled some wisdom in the process. Funny and emotional, I adored it! Once again, thank you, Sean. High-quality interview, as always!
there will never be a competitor to go harder than Conan just did wow!
Even though he's probably the guest that had the most hotsauce altogether. He looked like the guest that sweated the least. Unreal! lol
LOL I love Conan. With hot sauce lipstick he looks a bit much like his mum.
Up there with some of the best episodes
"Whats wrong with me why cant i feel!"
the way Conan destroyed the bomb without anyone warning him was wonderful, but the "Dr. Arroyo" bits were the highlights for me,  (1) where did you go to medical school? "1998" Conan "no, where?" Dr. Arroyo: "out of state", (2) can you check my pulse? proceeds to choke Conan, Conan corrects him, "no you just check it" Dr. Arroyo "oh right" and eventually the diagnosis was, "it's there", (3) when Conan asked if it was a 4 year medical school he attended and the response was "it was supposed to be", that made me cry, (4) "he's not a GOOD doctor, he's an AFFORDABLE doctor", just gold  "Mistake........I like to announce my mistakes up front" (dying)
The Nixon impression got me😂
I would watch anything Conan! 😁
Thank you, Conan. Thank you.
conan  is  a  comedy  god
Conan is the best
He was always my favorite late night...had no idea he was so dedicated...even to such a niche show like hot ones.  All those swing shifts as a teenager I would come home and miss leno but always caught conan
Muppets? Could that work? Have the actual puppeteers eat the wings under the table while the muppets answer the questions in character? I could imagine Cookie Monster having fun with this. Or Kermit. And Abby Cadabby.
conan has been a favorite and legend since the time i saw him first hes perfect
This was the best thing I’ve ever seen
How much testosterone does he have ?
Conan is entertainment. He's a world class Triathlete of comedy.  What a good entertainer!
Hey Conan is Haiti still a paradise land ? planning on going there soon to drink coconuts with the Ax gang ?  while telling us "it's so great, vote biden"
Dr arroyo 😅
Conan IQ lvl is 160.
I thought I have seen him on here before?
Who's this person an alien!?
This Is The Greatest Episode Ever. 👹🍗😂
The man wrote the best Simpsons episodes ever....
22:36 that is probably the most worried face I've ever seen any human make 😂 the only thing that comes close are some of the characters from attack on titan when they're close to death
This was great 😂😂😂
Holy sh** dude straight up took a swig from the bottle 😲
This is the 100% polar opposite of the DJ Khalid episode. 😆 🤣 😂
Yo Conan is the real deal
Drinking the sauce 😂😂😂
I what to see the after show. Does hot ones give after care to guests? 😅
Conan really set the bar for this show now. I doubt anyone will come close though.
14:00 casualy sips on the bottle  Conan is a real chad! i respect him for not tearing up
was that the first wing drop on the show?
Conan with the old-timey references
"What's wrong with me?  Why can't I feel?!"   lol
Conan on hot sauce is a lot like Robin Williams on that fine Columbian Powder, " this hat is for people on Quaaludes"....remember that little ditty
EXCELLENT FINALE!  I have not laughed so hard at an episode.  I love how Sean handled all the unexpected drama Conan displayed.  GRACE, SEAN!  YOU ARE AMAZING.  Conan, I love you.  I can't wait for the  next season!
That Bea Arthur prediction is freaking wild lol.
lightning in a bottle.....just brilliant.....bravo!!!!!
Wow! And I thought Steve-O was unhinged. 😂😂
We need Conan back again!
By far, the craziest episode I’ve seen so far. Not sure anyone will top this. Conan is a beast.  I never laughed so much. Thanks Sean for having him on.
Almost choked on my drink when he started talking about Hardy 😂
Funniest episode ever!! Absolutely unhinged and i love it
This is the most amazing thing i have ever watched. Conan made this his show and im all for it.
This is now my favorite episode!
Conan is a legend.  Always loved him, seems like a genuine good dude.
I've never seen an Irish with so much color other than white in their face but here we are
This is immediately GOATed.
the lastest of last dabs, wow  He's never gonna taste again
How many times did Sean say "incredible" during this episode? He's just like all of us, in awe of the genius of Conan.
Conan is the GOAT of late night hosts. His improv is out of this world, if you haven't watched his remotes yet then you have missed out
Food-in-pockets is one of my favorite gags. I love getting strange looks from the one relative at a family dinner that sees me sneak french fries into my shirt pocket, and then they look around to see if anyone else is reacting the same way. Classic.
Was that a temporary reincarnation of Robin Williams speaking to us through the hot sauce at 21:05 ?
What a pro!! The greatest guest for sure!
Legend! Best guest!
The greatest episode of HotOnes, Conan truly a living legend.
This was so scary to watch, how did he do this? 😭😭😂
Best show ever
Jesus! Conan is a BEAST!
This is why no one watching cable TV anymore...
This may be one of the most impressive and equally horrifying episodes to date.
I think he genuinely just hit a line of coke before the interview
Been a while since I've had a genuine laugh.
Im surprised xonan didnt die
OGM... A Master class of entertainment exhibited by Conan!! Is there anything he cant his own, while sharing it with the people. BEST HOT ONES EVER!!!!!
The next guest HAS to be Steven Segal! Make it happen!
I still can't believe Conan looks 20 years younger than my dad and they're the same age!
What a madman. Disgusting, but I love it. Thank you for having Conan, the legend himself. This was The_Best_Episode. I'm in tears 🤣
Dude made it his own. We bow down to  King CoCo
Not only he is one of the greatest host ever but conan is the greatest guest ever 💥
Day 1 of requesting Shane Dawson.
I’ve never seen anyone make Sean Evans tap out before.  🤯🤯🤯
Rubbing it on your fingers? not a great idea.. I bet he washed his hands and thought he's fine and then went to the toilet and had a.. Moment...
He came on the show.. Owned the show from the start.. And finished like a boss
Legend!
23:45 That poor hot sauce bottle bleeding out to it's very end LOL !!! 🤣🤣🤣
why are they sitting so far apart from one another?
Fkn mad man XD
The water buffalo story was good😂
Conan has been my favorite guest on hot ones so far, he absolutely bodied that gauntlet!
CONAN!!! ❤ 😂
realization: Conan is not more interesting than Sean Evans
Any other guest would have looked Crazy 🤣
This couldn’t have been anymore perfect of an episode! This is exactly what I expected from Conan! Thank you! Simply the best! Should be number one video of all time!
The best episode in First we Feast ever since it began!!!!! ❤❤❤ Funnier than Gordon Ramsay episode!!! 😂😂😂❤❤❤🌹🌹
How did his final speech make me cry? There's comedy everywhere! Wing drop. Wow.
don't watch this while eating, especially after 20:30...
disgusting and not funny at all.
Is Conan on drugs? This was weird....
That was amazing.
Conan never disappoints! This was epic!
The way he took his temp, you knew right away he was a fake dr, lol
How does anyone follow this?
🔥 I’m late for work but I don’t care 🤣🤣🤣🤣
ROFLMFAO!!!!!° THE BEST EPISODE EVER!!!!!!!
best episode ever . he actually showed what show business is actually about . conan the king
Makes me miss the Conan O’Brian show!
Conan the GOAT made that hot one's the best ever like he only knows how
The last 4-5 minutes are gut-bustingly hilarious. 🤣
Call the wife!!!
Dude is so funny he can make hot sauce not effect him
Wow, just wow
Probably one of the best
Woow, respect, he made the shows look like boom, and he made all the hotsauce look like tomato puree  No , not one man seen survive this welll and laughed their way out And he was that old man who never really had spice before , i respect this man ,good one
Absolute legend.
I was never going to watch Conan’s HBO show. I will watch every episode of however many seasons they create after this.
21:06 🤣🤣👏👏👏
Living legend....and Conan is kinda great..
Conan the Saucean. 😂 What a guy. God of comedy. Day in day out he does his thing, makes us laugh. Just brilliant
What a BOSS 😂
Get mike tyson on hot ones ! That would be awesome !!
this is EPIC)))
That one is definitely in my top 10
You should have Sabrina Carpenter on the show!
I want to see Joey badass on the show.
Connan O´Brian. Oh man. You are the greatest comedic genius that has ever stepped foot on this planet, I will never regret these words, please do not ever end.
ALL HAIL CONAN!!!!!!!!!!
Conan went full Rick Sanchez near the end there
Well Conan, you probably didn't consider that it will burn a second time on the way out
Conan with the slight jab at Leno all these years later as he should! haha. "Don't know what that other guy was about" when referring to late night hosts at the time.  Genius.
Years from now, this appearance will be looked at as legendary. Conan is in the same club as Norm McDonald and Richard Pryor.
Conan is the top guest for this, no question
Couldn't even watch by the end with everything dripping off his face.
This guy's hilarious
Conan O'Brian is the most consistently funny comedian of his time.
legend
conan was probably cussing himself for a week after this episode but it was absolutely worth it. dude gave us the best hot ones episode ever and very likely will make the hot ones future episodes even better with his inspiration.
Well, I didn’t see it getting that crazy.  Wing drop for Conan.
I love Conan!!!
I think this is the BEST episode ever! I laughed so hard, I'm crying! Conan is a beast!
He killed the show by not giving 110 but 200%..... This is how to live life
This definitely gets one of the top spots on the list for best hot ones guests
Conan O'Brien's level of commitment to comedy and entertaining his audience sometimes remind me of Robin WIlliams.  You can tell he truly gives it all he's got and it works.  Love him.
great host, great guest, great editing. this is the first time i saw conan respects the host and doesnt take over completely. this is the best episode ever. 2 of the best and genuinely respecting each others' abilities.
The dig on MAD magazine was amazing
This is my favorite late night host of all time
Best one yet
King Conan always deliver. The Greatest!!
What a legend. I love this man
The way I screamed when he lathered the sauce onto his hands lol
As long as we have Conan, the world will be okay.
Actually big dik move
9:30 THE ECHO!!! lolol
I haven't cried laughing like this with a piece of tv in ages, histerical!! GOAT
I've never seen Sean issue pure concern for someone like he did when he chugged the last sauce. 22:37
Greatest Show to date!!!!!
Talk show host GOAT.. not IMO.. FACTS! Conan, we  admire and applaud you!
Dafuq did i just watch
Conan sure killed being the guest! I love his guts! What a man!
21:06 MY EYESSSSS
Mad lad that dude😂
best one so far
I was waiting for him to rub hot sauce all over his face so his skin matches his hair.
Conan is an absolute marvel, a consummate showman, just a pro. I love himmmm
pause at 18:31
best hot ones episode ever
Oh Conan, you're just like wings. You keep getting hotter and hotter.
Conan destroying da bomb is pretty incredible
FINLAND MENTIONED!!! TORILLE!!!
How could you not ask about Jordan shlanky?
This was amazing <3
Every time he referred to his doctor as "inexpensive" or "affordable" I just lost it. I don't know why that's so funny to me.
I just cancelled MAX and Conan is bringing back to it.
Conan is a F Legend! What a show!  Total mad man!
This was the best episode ever. Thanks, Conan! You are THE man!
Outstanding
CONAN"S THE BEST🤣
When he drinks the hot sauce 😂
9:00 That's interesting, because it was one of Conan O'Brien's standard bits that the show wasn't going well, that it was terrible, or wouldn't air. For example, he said that to easily 70% of sketches by his team.
he can NOT TURN IT OFF. perfection
He's seen the show before, he's seen Da Bomb before, he will do w/e it takes for the bit. GOAT. No contest.
He was always my favorite late night host. Hands down.
Ogs, know "the way"
Best episode!!
By far the best episode ever! I was dying! 🤣🤣🤣
“To quote my hero Popeye” 🤣😂🤣😂
Conan: "I am bringing a second set of clothes, that's how wild I'm going to get!"  Me: * rolls on floor laughing *
I laughed until I cried! The absolute GOAT!!!
A1
Getting my a complement from one of the top talk show host in decades should be pretty high for sean
his contour is slaying
22:59 LOL I CAN'T! 😂🤣🤣🤣
LoL goodness gracious
it's the juxtaposition between the high quality of the interviewee and the ridiculous nature of the show that makes it a smash hit....
Dear lord! I hope it doesn't burn twice!
Please invite Chef John
Conan leads the G.O.A.T pack through his commitment and co”wit” ment to the bit- being in the moment, and giving his all, even if it means death. Live by the sword, die by the sword. Conan is the barbarian of comedy.  Excellent interview as always Sean. You received praise and your official knighting from one of the best interviewers of our time. Carry on Hot Ones team!!
holy moly xD
That water buffalo incident is so dumb. That producer should get fired for that.
I have always loved Conan, such a handsome redhead🖤🖤🖤
Conan is on Hot Ones? Perhaps God exists after all.
No one will top this 😂
He"s absolutely Nuts! We Love IT!
What a unit
I must say one of the best ever
@FirstWeFeast how does Conan feel about barbeque? surprised he went for buffalo wings on here considering the beautiful barbeque in the stunning haiti thats going on
By the last phase, Conan was acting like Rick in Rick & Morty
Love him 😅😅🤣🤣😇
WING DROP🤣
This is up there with Ramsay and beyond 😂 so good! Cheers!
I think this is the best Interview ever
So Conan never jumped off the cocaino strings. Can`t say I enjoyed this one at all.
If this surprised you, you should really see Conan going to a koeran spa (With Steven Yeun). Or to a dominitrix.
This was the best thing I've watched. I was gagging and laughing so hard at the end. Conan is the GOAT!
There’s nobody who does not love a Conan laugh. And, there’s nobody who does not love Conan laughing. Cause, in hindsight- it’s equally fun.
Never clicked on a video so fast
please do Howard stern!
Conan is the greatest guest to ever grace this show
Conan going places doing things is my favorite Conan format! not gonna lie!
I can't say anything that any commenter's  haven't already said. But yeah the way he stacked bits, became more unhinged but still found a way to give a very insightful interview is really really off the charts impressive.
I am so glad I watched this.
Finally my favorite guest!
Hands down, Best episode ever....
❤this was the best 🎉
I never thought I'd actually watch a recorded mid-life crisis 😂
I think his Irish Catholic upbringing literally prevented him from developing spice receptors in his mouth.
What did I just watch ?!? Crying, I was laughing so hard. Conan is the BEST !!! How did he do it?
6.6m views in 4 days, Ice Spice got 1m in 2 weeks. Shows you big Conan is!
100% pure commitment!
Conan is alway hilarious been watching him since the early 2000’s. This episode was so good 😁
"That's okay. We got pockets."
The king!
Definitely the funniest episode yet
I believe, the most awesome guests and the great great show ever in hot ones!!!
Hands down, the best episode of Hot Ones ever
This was so funny thanks for that i cryerd from laughing !
THIS is why Conan is the best ever.
Conan the O'Barbarian.
What an absolute gem.
> dips the wing in the sauce bottle > throws the wing > drinks right out the bottle > refuses to elaborate further
in the year 2000 :)) thanks for featuring my late night hero :)) love the show :))
Conan is a national hero and a real man.
CALL THE WIFE had me dead
man his acting is on point, he is so funny and professional
I love him ...  Nobody did tht bfor
He kinda annoys me but honestly he’s a true comedian and I laughed a lot at this
Who here searched for "Conan water Buffalo" immediately after this?!?
Love it😂
He rubbed the sauce to his nips 🤣 🤣 🤣   the slobbering end speech  💀
I love that Conan started with a bit. Classic.... all the way to the end... "whats wrong with me, why cant i feel!?"  This is the BEST ONE YET
😂 Conan is just Comedy GOLD 🤣 Glad you guys got him on the show .....laughed really Hard 😅..
he's a natural
Excellent!
Most of your sauces are trash. You should be ashamed for disrespecting the wing game with your cardboard tasting garbage.
It is true. The gingerman feels NOTHING !
That was one of the most epic episodes ever!
Best one yet! Killed it! 😊😅❤
I have finally found a TRUE use for an exclamation mark....  !
I don’t think anything can ever top this episode
Conan is great! My favorite episode so far.
Did he just drank that bottle like a soda? hahahaha!
Best ever! Did Conan have Covid and lose his senses of taste and smell?
Conan you crazy mf 💚
I like this guy
Stop pushing this.
100% best episode of all time, Conan killed it.
Wow, just wow.  Absolutely stole the show.  A true entertainer! :)
this one goes down in history 😅😂
Best episode ever?
Conan, always a showman... Love it. I have been suggesting him to do a travel show for the better part of a decade! Glad to see it.
Love Conan!!!!!
More proof that the last dab X is a lie. Lol. He literally drank from the bottle. Matasanos is hotter, but tastes awful. Nearly unbearable.
Conan completely reinvented Hot Ones, best episode ever
most entertaining hot ones ever! one that i watched till the end.
Most sane Irishman
That was senior abuse.
The greatest Hot Ones ever with the Greatest to ever host a show Coooonan O Briannnnnn 👏🏼 pure comic genius
Spice ruins all taste. Thats the purpose of it. To diguise the bad taste of the food.
This man truly is something else. Really shows how well he is equipped to keep his composure too. He defied the whole premise of the show.
The best in many years ! The show must go on !
Epic. The perfect blend of host and guest and sauce.
This guy is pretty good. He should host a show or something.
He got so motivational there with the “it’s not a bit” part
Conan is such a class act above all other corporate talk show “personalities”.
Absolutely epic.
The Season Finale With Conan Was A Great Idea!
Conan is unbelievable
Billie Joe Armstrong!?
That man is on taste bud steriidy
Ric Flair: WOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Yes, a doctor of education.
This gotta be the craziest episode ever
Check out the hot ones views with other celebrities. You’ll realise the difference between being on the spotlight and being famous. 6.6 m views in just 4 days
Conan is an example of a man who maxed out his Charisma stat
We need the Lawrence brothers on this show
Max: 🥸
Game over man. I guess that is wrap. You are going to have to cancel the show now. Thanks Conan.
"I can still remember the plug! That's a professional!" It sure is Conan, by Jove did you deliver
Single greatest episode in this shows history.
Conan is the goat!
This is the best hot ones episode ever.
A True BARBARIAN. well done CONAN
Connan is a legend
Conan is one of the funniest humans ever, love him
God save the Conan! True comedy legend!
This is by far the greatest episode of the show, so much that putting a #2 would be an insult.
Amazing
Conan is hilarious. Shame he caught TDS.
Amazing.... funny... inspirational...what a great artist ❤
THIS IS INSANE
"I never saw spice" - that's some Dune reference over here
Conan O'Brien is a creepiest Legend. No one can beat him in humour
I hope Conan doesn't wear contacts.... lolol
Finland mentioned... TORILLA TAVATAAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🤣🤣🤣 wow,  what a performance
Literally the only late night host that was ever truly funny
Great episode!! Hope to see him on JRE next
Loved the show but this is just moronic. He totally overdid it. Dumb episode for a dumb nation.
FINALLY 🎉🎉🎉
Conans work ethic and passion are simply unfuckingparalelled.. !!! I have a different yet sobering respect for him now more than ever.. What a show!
There's a reason why I think Conan O'Brien is a genius. This proves it again ...
Best episode....ever!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Episodes usually hit 1M, this hitting 6M in 4 days says a lot about Conan❤
Conan is so underrated I love him!!!
Is Obrian related to that Block Head who owns Twitter? CRINGE
Connor would be a good joker
This was the best one yet! Conan killed it
Conan!!! ❤
Conan is the most badass guest at this show so far
Best episode ever
I love this man!
Tears of laughter!!!   I heard so much hype about this and it exceeded my expectations!     Between this and the Ryan Gosling SNL, it's a good week for comedy.
The GOAT of Late Night!!!
love
And that's why Conan is the BEST!! We LOVE you Conan!! I can't wait to watch your new show!!
everything we have suspected about gingers has just been confirmed lol
Wow, Gingers do really have no souls!
By far the funniest episode. And ive seen them all
FINLAND MENTIONED!! 💙🇫🇮 Thanks Conan!
Someone stop this mad man 😂
If anyone hasnt seen his "Conan must go" series, it is fantastic.
Conan is crazy and the best! Best episode hands down 😂
This is how a legend looks like : )
Conan seems to be the king of spice. I want to see him devour a Phaal curry. That'll be the true test!!
Oh my god, this must be the funniest Hot Ones chapter. I laughed so hard.
As someone who's had Da Bomb before, I felt so bad for him when he licked it.
conan completely controlled this episode!!! he’s just so AMAZING at what he does
I am terrified for Conan...
Conan is the best!!
Apparently, the Irish never used napkins!
Me screaming “NO, CONAN! NOOOOO!!!!” at my phone screen while he does the final sauce. lol
Wow, that was hilarious!)))
I see alot of William Montgomery here
To me, Conan O’Brien and Martin Short are the funniest people on the planet 😆 This was utter chaos with moments of clarity and nuggets of wisdom.
Folks.  He's got a show on Max. They used to called it HBO but people found that too popular. He's a professional.
Is it just me or was Conan high during this interview
One of my favorite episodes
I always love when the guests say good things about Sean's hard work.
Man, Conan is a nut case!....so funny.
Do you think Sean got clearance from Richard Lewis before he tried to talk to Conan?
I will never understand how anybody can find entertainment out of watching other people eat disgusting food
So the adrenaline of performing can override the effects of the BOMB? Conan! Wow! But still... Shacks reaction to the bomb was the funniest ever hot ones moment...
THIS JUST IN; Conan on hot ones is officially the greatest comedic interview‼️‼️‼️
OK - Call Ramsey - show him this - and then END THE SERIES !!!! :-)))))))))))))))))))
That's it! Conan saying Sean is a great interview just made my day!
Conan is a some type of goblin or gremlin and it's great
Wow 😂👏🏽
This was the most iconic episode of all time
This was the best, the absolute best =) Conan being Conan and the world needs more. I never met someone who didn’t like him and I doubt I ever will. Watching him actually improves your mood and day
Made sure the bots came out to this one. Hur hur orange man bad
😂😂😂.  Possibly the funniest episode yet.  😂😂😂😂😂😂
You should have experienced the travel logs my grandmother drug me to as a kid
The most crazy of all time the Chilly are crying 😂😂😂😂😂
The GOAT. I couldn't believe my eyes. But.. of course! It's fudging CONAN!
You should get uncle roger
I am on my third day of juice fast. What wouldn't I do just for a bite of the hottest wings😭 Also, I must ask, is Conan still alive?😮
Conan is crazy asf and..Could you just use plastic gloves ??
This went down as one of the most iconic hot ones episodes of all time. What a great episode!
Excellent show
Maybe the funniest thing Conan has ever done. Respect to him for really going for it. He tried a bit too hard to be Robin Williams but he almost made it work.
i heart Conan <3
Conan is easily one of the greatest comedic entertainers we've ever seen. This video alone illustrates that.
Legendary
Dr. Arroyo was hilarious
This has got to be the best episode I’ve ever seen of this show
Conan is an american treasure
This is history.
This is not only the best Hot Ones episode ever, but up there in best interviews of all time
I freaking love Conan! Truly one of the best Hot Ones episode ever!
I think this is the funniest episode??
I love coco with all my 🧡 heart
This was insanity.
Conan is the GOAT. Never disappoints.
Conan is a national treasure
amazing one of the best episodes ever
Best episode ever! Fire Jimmy Kimmel!
Conan might just be the most effortlessly funny person on the planet. I giggled like a kid throughout the entire video 😅
“ You can’t stop me from being who I am!” Which is an obvious squirrel brain, who lets the intrusive thoughts to win a little too often ..
Love conan
Conan is a comic madman !!!
This was almost too good to be true.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  Now do Craig Ferguson!
If there is a better episode than this I'd like to know!
FINLAND❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥 Torille!!! Conan is the best late night host ever. Love from Finland🇫🇮
This was hands down one of the best interviews xD
Conan channeling John Wayne Gacy.
I love conan. still mad at leno over what he did. an apparently conan is too, just calling him "the other guy" lol
Little did they know that Conan is fueled by pain
Comedy Gold
"call the wife!"   I'm crying
Never thought this day would come........
This is the Proof. Redheads have no soul.
I absolutely love this show and Sean Evan’s is an amazing host.  This is hands down my favorite episode.  Conan is just incredible.  Hilarious jokes aside, he gave great, honest answers  and didn’t feel the need to be “on” with every  response.  Amazing show.
Conan
Sean learned a lot on this interview
Pure genius
He had such class and style on his late show.
Waaaait a second, doesnt Conan deserve now to be the Top1 Hto Wings Hall of Fame ? 😀
I guess im the only one who thinks the sean guy is creepy and not a good host.
Hats off to him. I think he is the only one we actually poured extra sauce on most of his wings and devoured the wings...with extra sauce on it. And he didn't even flinch while being entertaining.
Legend
This might be the best episode ive ever seen
Sean was so outmatched here haha
Wow… what a freaking compliment! And sooo well deserved. Sean is one of the all time best interviewers! The King, himself, telling Sean what an amazing interviewer he is… 🥲 I almost got teary eyed for him. 🫶🏻
Can we get Flula Borg next? 🙏
Conan is the respected "elder statesman" of late night comedy.
This is the best one yet. Conan is a legend.
This episode is 1 hunnid 😂
Holy *#^!
The best hot ones episode in the history 🎉
IM FINE! IM PERFECTLY FU@#$$ING FINE!! XDDDD
I needed this so much in my life. The world is bleak right now but dear lord Conan, that was amazing. Oscar worthy. I also now know what Conan on coke would be like. You could tell the heat high hit when he went 3 stooges. Oh god my sides.
7:45 was hilarious  7:55 "it's there" 😂 so unexpected it cracked me up
Conan hilarious. He really goes well over for the comedy. Love it. Haha. I miss his show..
Conan is an absolute genius 😂😂😂
That was so entertaining that they were on the last dab in what felt like a minute 😂😂
poor toilet..... oh conan... i loveyou
Conan is a straight up beast! They wasted this guy's talent. He is one if the best things out there. Actually the both of you are. Thanks for what you do. This is the best episode ever! Hands down.
“He who controls the spice controls the universe.”
This is the fucken best episode ever hahahaha that was so crazy
“He’s very affordable”
This is the best so far 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
oh that poor GI tract...
Alright, im sold Conan, just tell me what to do
ANIMAL
Good to see Conan hosting again. Hopefully he brings on Sean Evans again as his guest
This is the best episode of hot ones
3 things I learned from this episode.    1) Conan is by far the HUNGRIEST guest on this show ... 2) Conan gets LOUDER on hot sauce.   3) Conan needs a doctor.  (a reasonable one)
Close to my birthday, i have on the 17th of april
Next get Jordan Schlansky
BEST. EPISODE. EVER. I didn't even consider this might be possible
Best frikking episode. Legends!
conan never disappoints
Conan had to put up with pepper-x and a host being a grateful idiot at the same time....
Amazing!
This man is so dedicated to the bit and I love it.
This is the best interview I've seen on the web!
Just perfect.
Johnny Carson. David Letterman. Conan O'Brien 🫳🏻🎤
Finally, an amazing guest
This was funny.
What is the dumb panic music for?
Conan. Is. My. Spirit. Animal. 🐺
5 minutes after recording, Conan O’Brien spontaneously combusted due to a hot sauce overdose. 20 times above the legal limit.
Conan is so unserious and I love that
I have been impressed with many guests on this show, but Conan takes the crown.
He's going straight to the emergency room!
You can't stop Conan from being genuinely funny. What a great Mothereffin' show. Also, I'm going to need Dr. Arroyos contact info.
If Conan wasn't a legend already, this would make him one.
I love how Conan is so unfazed they need to hit this dramatic music so hard, just to create any kind of tension :)
I get some Robin Williams vibe here. RIP
He drank that sauce like he lived his life, to the fullest
Jesus Christ!!... he's gonna be hurting so f***n bad after the cameras stop rolling!... 😳🤣
He's still gonna feel this days after. 😅
Conan’s the best man, no other late night hosts beside letterman and Carson compare
HANDS DOWN THE BEST GUEST EVER
Conan is just the GOAT!
Nope didnt like how Conan dominated this, in a harsh agressive "funny" way.  You are a amazing host Sean I love the way you interview and appreciate guests with more respect to your person. You don´t need this tipe of entertainment just because someone is a "Celeb"...
I love how the water turned to milk. Excellent editing
wow
Absolute masterpiece!!
Incredible
I love he brought along one of the actors for the late night show
As expected, this was truly brilliant.
He's so natural and coming from his comedy background I bet he's eaten spices from all around the world. It was great seeing him show no fear or hesitation and gave his all for entertaining us. It really shows he cares about putting on the show
Love Conan
This is the first full episode of Hot Ones I've watched and I don't think I need to watch another one. None of them could possibly be this good.
Conan just took over the SHOW XD Loved every second of it
Conan is a beast!
Total legend 🎇 Conan, You got a friend in me.
Wing drop 🪽
The pain he had after this show must be once in a life but the show was too 🤘🏻
10 years later I am still watching the old Team Coco Remotes and Clueless Gamer
There's been guests who've turned the tables but I think this is the first time I've seen Sean become the guest.
My hero Popeye
Conan is the man just incredible!!! Respect!!!
give this man an Oscar
Is Conan flaunting his Pitboy look to celebrate the release of Fallout?  ☢
finally 😂 next Andrew Santino..
We need Keanu
My absolute favorite episode so far. Great guest and host back and forth.
The Tonight Show with Sean Evans
Respect Conan.
Genius.
If anyone has C.O. over, this is pretty normal.  Other than than the mess, he's cool.
He made even Stev-O look like a whimp. Holy sh....
I think he broke Sean.
Incredible
out of all the hot ones guests who is on this video im watching, conan has got to be the best one
Did Conan survive?
Anyone got an ID on Conan's jacket ?
What a god
Should have done the episode in Haiti.
Favourite one yet
Conan really handled them hot ones really well. I was expecting him to atleast turn beat red in the face and probably giving up half way through, but no he handled it better than most.
JFC!!! Connan is the Man!
My god 😂😂😂 Connan is literally crazy 😆
When he said The other guy instead of Leno . Lol
Conan played Russian roulette with a fully loaded gun and won.
Conan is even funnier getting interviewed. By far the best interview
With all the great things aside I really think 23:00 is gonna be a meme soon. 😂🤣🤣
Not a big fan of him but now I am 😂😂😂
Conan is such a good entertainer. Absolute legend.
The best episode of this ever
Greatest guest ever, I love conan
Oh how I have missed him. Best show host EVER.
I know you want Conan to support this series. Awesome good job. However he just made a mockery of this show… if you didn’t see I feel sorry for you.
I cant!! I CANT! WHAT A MESS HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHA
i'm having spiritual awakening while watching conan diipin sauce.........
This has to be the best interview yet
21:14 omfgggg 😂
I love to see our comedians are still unhinged. Love it
Best episodio ever!!! Jajaja
"out of state" you should go reaction 🤣😂
Conan Never Disappoints.
I will be reactivating my HBO Max subscription just for Conan.
Maybe sean should fill a late night spot when it opens
WOW what a actor
That should be Arroyo’s slogan: “not the best, but very affordable”.  I’d visit, just sayin
Hahahahahhahahaahhahaha what a f***ing legend ❤❤❤
No way that conan doesn't eat spicy. He was unfazed 😂
This is it. Hot Ones has peaked right here. No way it can get any better than this. Sean is a fantastic interviewer and an amazing host but even he couldn't keep up with the absolute tsunami that was Conan.
Amazing, Conan looked as old twenty years ago as he does now.
Inspirational.
If Conan had ever watched the show he would know this is a serious interview there’s no live audience and its not necessary for him to be on, yet he’s doing these weird bits with the doctor and taking the bones home and asking each time if he can, basically these bits he is doing is just for himself because he wants to and thats what makes it so funny
Excellent!
Best ever.....
I live in Sweden and in 1993 I visited a friend in Los Angeles and   every night I went to bed I always watched the show and since then I have loved Conan, he is the Best😂💞😂🍿🍻
This is THE BEST episode of this entire show!!! Love Conan!! ❤️
Best appearance on any talk show ever😂😂😂
Let's face it this isn't your first time here
Ernie Kovacs  just gave Conan O'Brien a standing ovation. O'Brien went totally Hunter S Thompson gonzo and brought his own Oscar Zeta Acosta (i.e., Doctor Arroyo). This season final is the best episode of Hot Ones. I cannot image any future session that will come close. Previous ones now pale in comparison.  The word 'goat' is overused. O'Brien's performance broke the concept of that word. This is a keeper.
Get Tech N9ne
Hahaha. What a legend!
WOW..  Conan blew it UP!  Conan raised the bar.
Absolutely living legend
Dr. Arroyo? Fallout 2 settlement? Conan confirmed for Fallout season 2.
I'm crying with laughter
Best Episode EVER!!! 🤣❤🙌
This is definitely the behavior I've come to expect from Conan... Great interview
Conan really went all out 💀 this is why he’s my favourite TV host
Jesus Christ I love this man.
I really likes Conan as a host, he is my all time 2nd fav (after Craig Ferguson) but this... Isn't it. It was cringe IMO. At the end I had second hand embarrassment
Wat a show , the best ever!!  Conan the KING so funny
This was the most unhinged thing I've ever seen and I'm all for it!
it's a surprise that Conan was crazier on hot ones than Eric Andre
I’m just mad watching Conan ruins a really nice jacket stuffing it with bones 😂
He definitely was feeling the high off of the sauces as she should!!! 😭🤷🏻‍♂️🙌🏻✨️🙏🏻🔥🥵
Epic!
holy moly conan is the conan
Finally! Someone interesting and worth watching!
GOAT !!!👏👏👏👏👏
TOP THAT KIDDOS!!
He’s a menace and honestly the best entertainer of our time.
Single best interview on this channel. Hands down.
Canon is still a hero. Like the TV person I connected with as a teen. Can not believe he's 60
hall of fame episode. no notes.
Seriously you can finish this show after Conan. No other guest will be as good, funny, insane as he was!!!  Ps: please show us footage after he was done!!
Love it! 😂
No such thing as The Last dab for Conan.
>imagine be Sean >being a powerhouse internet talk show host for years.   >people are impressed with your insane spice tolerance >guest after guest comes on your show and fall to your incredible spice tolerance >Gordon Ramsey drinks a bottle of Pepto bismol on your show >after a power house season of incredible guests who could you bring on to top >Conan O'brien comes on your show and tells everyone he is Irish and does not do well with spice >Conan reminds you that he has been doing talk show television for 30 years >Conan asks you when the hot wings start >Conan proceeds to drink hot sauce on your show >Conan then proceeds to drink multiple hot sauces on your show, about hot wings >Conan asks you when the hot wings start >Conan takes over Hot ones >Conan O'Barbarian
LEGEND
This whole video is edited to the point it's for him to look good. the edits are so edited you can tell it's all over the place. Conan only apprehended and the memes wont happen. this episode is just... cringe. A good show is being ruined.
Other than Norm MacDonald, Conan is my favorite comedian. But only when he is trying to be funny and not push a liberal policy.
Holy Conan is the greatest, this had me physically laughing on a morning train ahahaha this is one for the hot ones history books I can’t believe it
I really love Conan's commedy Sadly I wouldn't be able to see the show in my country
Cinema. Pure cinema.
We need that water Buffalo footage 😂
2016 to 2017 is me binging either Hell's Kitchen episodes or Conan's tonight show and those were probably the greatest years of my life. I never knew it then but I know it now
Conan and Greg Ferguson are the best for entertainment and keeping the pace interesting and fun.
Soooo I’ve never been more impressed by a guest on this show before and probably never will again.
Legendary.
26:30 - I know basically no one is gonna mention this (because how can you not talk about Conan here?) but I just wanna give camera guy Bill the maddest of props for one-handing that baseball bat like he's been playing for the Mets since he was a teenager. Bravo, sir!
Legendary 😂🤘🏻 Love Conan
He sounds soo much like Timon from Lion King (1994), just realized this lol
He came, he saw, he conquered. Simple as that.
By far the funniest ever hot ones.
CONAN IS A LIVING LEGEND 🐐
I am in awe.
he was funny when I was 5 and he's still funny now that I'm 18 what a wonderful guy.
This was who they should have given the USA version of Taskmaster to
Conan the absolute GOAT! Undefeated
Probably the best episode ever….
I have never laughed so hard at a hot ones. Love you Conan!!
By far the best episode ever!
Crazy guy, love him.
Oh my God!  I haven't laughed so hard in a long time
THAT.WAS.AMAZING.
He was channeling some Farley - Conan is still hilarious!
Give me what he's having!
God i love Conan, he's the max
This has to be one of the best episodes ever. I was laughing so much 😅 He's a legend!
Seems like he had something before getting these spices. I can't believe what he did. hahaha. We need to have Dope test on Conan. lol
...but then Conan literally recovers the momentum and even brings more opportunity to rebuild momentum with Dr. Arroyo... this was a master lesson on hosting
Love and mad respect from S.Korea! Conan should more of these spicy Mukbang chugging that 2M+ scoville was INSANE THE BEST!
Conan was brilliant.....
Why does this just have 6m views ????? jesus!!!!!!!! lol
*CURRENTLY REWATCHING THIS*
OK, this is probably my 6th or 7th time watching this... every single time (yes, including the 1st one) I didn't like Sean's argument on 18:34, at that point it was OBVIOUS everything was comedy and the argument made it loose momentum
Conan is a legend for a reason, that was amazing and disturbing in equal messure :)
Conan was always my favorite late nite host. Jimmy Kimmel held a strong 2nd place for a bit before he became a total political puppet.
most boss guest ever.
23:50 RIP sauce haha
Conan the GOAT !!!
need to make a Hot Ones Funko Conan
That was honestly really gross lol
That moment of seriousness all to give Sean some well earned compliments from one of the best to ever do it was a really special moment
The Goat 🐐
his suffering was apparent but i'd say he handled da bomb like a champ ;D
This was fun. I've never seen Conan with so much actual color in his face than by the end of this interview. 😄
Incredible, nothing more to say than incredible.
This is the greatest hot wings episode
Conan is a coward who waited till norm and Oj were dead to expose the hypocrisy from nbc.
This episode deserves an Emmy. I e never seen anyone throw Sean off completely. This is the best one. Nothing can top this. Masterpiece.
Incredible... Amazing Conan
Conan ❤
this. was. the. best. one. ever!
I love you Conan! You killed it!
I have watch most of your show over the years and Conan was on fire.
I love how progressively unhinged Conan is getting throughout the episode.
Conan is the greatest talk show host to ever live. A true master
Love it , love it , the best ever episode hands down, Conan is the man for the job
"It's gonna hit me soon?" Maybe not not, maybe tomorrow :D :D :D
Conan is the embodiment of peak aries energy here loll
For a net worth of around 200 million I'd be definitely looking for the most affordable Doctor in the states. Actually just a friendly piece of advice Mr. O'Brien maybe try going to Mexico. Save a few bucks!
Conan freaking O’Brien ! The legend himself …. Save me some wings for later… I’d have watery eyes if I ever met him.
Conan is ok... but at the same time he turns to new shades of rorange :)
I haven't laughed so hard in so long. Conan is truly a gem of a human being
Hahaha, he went crazy xD
Just realized this episode it 27 minutes long and it felt like 10 minutes. I want more.
This is the best episode ever!!!
conan killed hot ones.. DEAD. whats the point of the show anymore?
This so much better than any other episode or any other show on youtube. Conan is the goat.
Gotta say this one is the best one for me
Always loved Conan
Conan's lips are swollen lol.
He was interviewed after this and said he burned himself from the hot sauce staying on his skin under his wedding ring.
licking the extra Da Bomb sauce is the most badass move in youtube history
The man made it his show, amazing episode.
Wow this man is insane 😂
I dont care what the number of views are, Gordon is #2 now. This is the best First We Feast episode ever. Conan is a God.
I have heartburn just from watching that. Conan hit that out of the park.....but he paid the price. Great comedy isn't easy.
Such a amazing episode 👏. Conan is a legend 🙌
The best show ever
To go from this to the Goldie Hawn interview and back to this…..what a diverse dude. Was my favorite watching him and Max Weinberg banter on my 19” tube tv in my bedroom just quiet enough for my parents not to hear. All whilst he’d puppeteer himself before cutting his own strings loose 😂
Best episode ever lol
What a good episode
And DJ Khaled bailed after the 3rd wing. Conan gave a masterclass! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
This encapsulated everything that makes Conan a legend.
I think I heard Sona laughing in the background 😂😂😂
I think Conan destroyed the "Charlie Rose with wings" show. He did not get his lesson with the water buffalo.  So commited to comedy, he did not flinch. Did he coated his mouth with wax and drank bismuth? Did he hallucinate a spirit guide? I give him 4 years of heartburns!
This the BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!! CoB is the GOAT!!!!!!!
What did I just watch? hahahaha
The stethoscope on the tongue took me out.
"the other guy" i see that subtle shade thrown out there haha
Clown
Conan is a Barbarian . . .
Not gonna lie, you guys have your work cut out for you for the next season. I mean how can you top this episode? Hahahah
I liked every moment of this. even when he pretty almost directly said "this isn't going well, is it?" when he said Sean was a good host. Even that built into another more awesome moment later.
this has been the only good hot ones interview since Mark Ruffalo
He must have been so incredibly sick after this. I'm sure he was warned, but oy.
I like your show. Now I don't
Conan is a spice lord
COnan o Brien is a beast for this hahahaha wow.
this, my fav
Respect 🔥
Some people spend their lives trying to be legends, Conan just is
The sheer commitment to the bit(s)... err, I mean not bits. To living to the fullest!  We got a spectacular reminder of why Conan is a comedy legend. 👏🏾
CONAN FOR PRESIDENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As expected, Conan is the best guest they've ever had on.
He acts like he's like y'all but he's still got literal 1920 make up on his face.
"Dr. Arroyo, he's not the best.. but very affordable" hahahahaha!😂
I’m dying 💀💀💀
WOW LAU-LAU !
Best episode yet.
Pause it at 24:30 - this picture sums it all up - hilarious!😅
Conan O’Brien is friends with Hillary Clinton … that is all
Greatest episode.
The GREAT Conan!
Conaaan 😍😂😍😂😍😂😍
Conan controlled the show so much that there wasn't even a question for sauce #9, and nobody noticed!
The best
Conan bodied this show not gonna lie 🤣
First time I've ever heard Conan with background music playing. Why? Because he's so uninteresting that you have to have easy listening music to make him entertaining? He's one of the most unboring of all time. Actually the host is fairly bland but having a Muzak background doesn't make him suddenly riveting.
definitely best one yet
Conan is a Legend! He dominated this episode🔥
single handedly the best guest and best episode of this I have seen. Conan is hilarious.
He’s a god
Best episode EVER!
This is a cinematic masterpiece. I’ll watch/listen to anything Conan is involved in.
No way that was real hot sauce... Fake...
I have watched this show for years and I can not remember when I have laughed this hard.  An absolute stunning end to the season.
this is a perfect example of what hard drugs does to a man. he went full send on the first few sauces and became an absolute mad man by the end. what a legend, what a season finale
This guy did da bomb
we might as well wrap the show up i dont think a guest is ever gonna top this
This man is a living legend... the Lore surrounding this man is crazy
Mocking my homecountry Finland, wow. He WAS a god here. Not so sure anymore.
My favourite host of all time♥️
Best episode ever hands down the man the myth the legend Conan you rule
Conan is the smartest man to ever write dumb jokes
I'm so impressed and am now more interested in Conan. I love this series.
He’s inhuman
Conan O’Brien just made Steve-O look like a wimp… I’m tossing all my bingo cards in the trash
The first time I saw Conan was on a TV, in the Yard of a ramdom frat party I crashed in Missoula Montana, I think it was 1993 or 94. They had a bunch of TVs and every time the TV showed Conan's face someone at the Party would bowl a bowling ball at a TV set. Best Hot Ones guest for the pure enthusiasm.
I'm not saying this to take away anything from what we just thoroughly enjoyed, but - what if, for the sake of the bit, the sauces were actually not the real thing?  What if they really weren't spicy at all so Conan could run the bit from his own talent?   For me, if that turned out to be true, I would have just as much respect for the level of comedy delivered regardless.   So it doesn't matter either way.  But the question did come to mind.   That said, I agree with many commenters; best episode ever.  🙂
Comedy genius
Has anyone done a brain scan on Conan? Is he ok! He always has to one up himself
I haven't started watching this yet but I already know I'm about to see the whitest man on the planet have the worst time of his life.
Best hot ones ever. Hysterical ending
watching Conan slowly turn into Donald Trump in real time is hilarious!
Conan is an actual Godsend
CONAN, I FKN LOVE!!!!!!!! YOU R THE MAN!!!!!!!! YOU R THE MAN OF ALL MAN!!!!!!!!!!!! 🫡
An absolute legend! Been watching his show since I was a kid. Now i binge watch his podcasts and videos on Youtube. Wish more people knew about him here in India.
whats the music?
So Mila Kunis finally got Conan to the show! ❤This is the first episode when I had a thought that the sauces were fake)) But Conan made it his show! ❤❤❤ Genius
No one, I mean NO ONE will ever top that. Conan is the man!
Conan on the toilet will get more views  ...just sayin'
Interesting to hear Conan say the F word! Loved the fake inept Doctor. 😆
Conan is epic.
Conan’s the best💯🔥 LEGEND!
I laughed the most vs all the others
anyone know where i can watch old Late Night episodes? I'm in Canada, so Peacock doesn't work  there was one episode around 2000, & Conan was really PO'd about something.  He just seemed really annoyed & angry the whole show.  nobody believes me, but i wish i could find it & ask Conan  it was so un-Conan-like  he did not want to do a show that day.
This is the best Hot Ones I've seen to date
This got to be the best episode ever
The 🐐
Yeah, this is my favorite one.
Hot ones was preparing just for this one episode
I love Conan but as he's aged his face now looks like my grandmother's.
Genius!
Conan has the superhuman ability of "Committing to the Bit" which allows him to do anything as long as it's for the entertainment of an audience.
This was one of the most unhinged and funny episodes of Hot Ones I ever seen. I miss Conan's usual antics in his old show where he just interacted with the staff, or went to Taco Bell with his crew making a mess of everything. It was golden times of Talk Shows and comedy
Top 5 worst Hot Ones episodes of all time
This is the best one hands down. Conan is the GOAT
Good God. I am actually concerned for Conan.
do they eat anything besides wings? 'cause i hate wings. they are garbage.
conan is now the most famous person in the world
Unbelievable. Conan's commitment should be shown to anyone who said something was too hard. I had a tiny dab of "da bomb" once, and it burned all the way down and turned my tongue numb for 20 minutes (and that's not even close to the spicest sauce they had!). You can't fake your body's responses to this level of pain. And yet, his determination and commitment and follow through, just wow. Brilliant. Amazing. Astonishing. There aren't enough words to describe this.
Conan is by far one of the most naturally funny people on earth. Nothing but love for Conan 🫶🏽😆
1:43 is that Jeff Goldblum
Best episode, amazing!
I think what Conan did here, and let's be clear he really went for it and not at just 110% but 1000% level, is the biggest sign of respect to Sean, and I am pretty sure he couldn't have imagined it even in his wildest dream. If these are genuinely the same hot sauces as everyone else got, how is this possible he can be that resistant? One thing is certain, he definitely lied and is no stranger to some really hot food.
Best part of the episode. 22:57
I absolutely love this man! He is still one of my fav comedians!
Best episode ever 😂👍🏻👍🏻🥇
Conan didn’t just commit to the bit, he IS the bit.
I've watched every episode and Conan just took the prize of best guest, bravo Conan! bravo!
Dude is a menace to society and I’m actually crying from laughter.
This was Connan’s show. Hes so good he makes this episode almost feel like it was scripted.(i know that it wasnt) What a master. No doubt the best night show host in history.
You ask for Conan... Oh you get ALL of Conan 😆
Cant stand sean evans, but conan makes him tolerable.
he definitely got high on the endorphin rush hahaha
Top. Tier. Episode.
This is the best hot ones episode of all time... it surely can not be bettered. Conan you crazy beautiful comedic legend!
One of the funniest things I've ever seen from start to finish. Real tears.
Conan, who can be frustratingly over the top just gave a comedic clinic. He never lost me,… he informed me, taught me and most importantly kept me laughing… brilliant man…
Why do people D ride Conan so much? Like I guess he was kind of the best of the late night guys if you don’t count Ferguson but it’s a pretty low bar. Those shows are all terrible.
So when is Conan auditioning for Joker. He's got it and were ready.
“WHATS WRONG WITH ME WHY CANT I FEEL?!”
This guys a lunatic not a fan he's unwell
Sean was not matching Conan's energy at all lol.
Legend
Conan - You are a freaking beast. Didn't expect this at all. Respect!
Conan rulz
I’ve been waiting for this Max show for a couple years now. There is no one like Conan. Him and his shows have provided more laughter in my life than anyone else
No one will ever top this episode, what a freaking Legend, Conan muthaf"kin O'Brian!!! SALUTE 🫡
my hero!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Unhinged!  What a legend
The part at 24:58 with him drooling the milk all over is what sent me over the edge, my sides hurt
Absolute LEGEND!!
Conan will remain one of the funniest person ever😂😂
One of the best ones yet😂😂
I'm honestly not sure what I am more impressed with, his comedic genus or how he crushed the hot sauces. No one has chugged out of the bottle like that or handled "The Bomb Beyond Insanity" that way. Talked "Smack" about the hot sauces from Start to finish.  Best "Hot Ones" ever !!!
Bruh yall forgot about my mans conan huh!
This is by far the best episode of Hot Ones 😂😂🙌🏻
By far, this is the best episode of Hot Ones I have ever watched. Conan is all-in no matter what he does, man.
By chaucers tales he means “Canterbury tales”
This is now the best hot ones episode
My father died recently. My sister came in thinking I was crying. I was crying laughing.
Amazing
Now. Before I watch him go from 600k to 2.6m.. I have a 2.9m sauce.. it physically feels like knives stabbing your tongue.
Conan did something to numb his tongue, only he would think about something genius like that. No way Conan would handle spicy like that.
This interview is still breaking the internet.
His family simply didn't use spices because they feel are immune to it so they decided to save money.
This was the BEST. EPISODE. EVER.
The respect I have for this man….
GROSSSSSS!!!!!! AWESOME! I will be watch that HBO show.... That's right HBO!
Love Conan😂❤
The best
That doctor seems legit to me.
Love you Conan 😂
This and koolio have to be top 2 episodes ever
DISGUSTING
This man is giving everything to us. He is a true entertainer. Thank you for loving us with your whole heart and soul, Conan. Your passion and authenticity will be sorely missed when you pass on within the next 4 years, tops.
Boost for Bretman
I gotta admit, Conan did not strike me as someone who could take this much spice... XD
Best episode I’ve seen. Shoutout team CoCo
After I watched this, I realized that I feel like Conan O'Brien is the modern day Danny Kaye. He is my favorite entertainer and as classic as you can get, multi-talented and hilarious and a wonderful person, and now Conan has taken his place. This was my favorite episode ever.
By far the funniest one I’ve seen 😂.
“Show business is ‘you’re getting the greatest show in the world.’” … Proceeds to give us the greatest episode of Hot Ones.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Conan starting to look like the mrs doubtfire costume
I love Conan! The chicken wings in the pocket 😂 idk why that's so funny, but it is. Great interview!
11:00  Reminds of the movie Nope
Best Hot Ones EVER!
*standing ovation*
OK, I knew this would be entertaining, but I say "goddayum"!  😂
So many great screen caps on Conan’s part pure chaos the bald guy didnt even speak till like 2 min in 😭
conan drank a candle before this interview
Best episode ever 😂😂😂😂😂😂
That was easily the best episode of the show ever. I really didn’t think they would top the first Gordon Ramsay episode. But they did , congrats guys this is the best. Conan is the truth.
GOAT
All the comments are hyping this man up but now I just think hes on Adderall.
This will never be beaten....NEVER!  Conan is king of the wing!!! All hail Conan!!!!!
Conan: Where did you go to medical school?  || Dr. Arroyo: 1998, out of state. ||  Conan: You should go. 🤣
it's usually sean and the wings against the guest but it's conan and the wings against sean and i love it
OH SHIIIII*     Tears of laughter from the last 3 bottles onward - Conan is insane!
Conman never disappoints 😂🤣
Conan, rub your eyes, I dare ye!
Loved the episode, but I do just want to say I feel a certain off-screen effort that Sean is putting in to keep up with Conan that I really would've liked to have seen more of (even snippets). Hard to tell if he's acting it up instead of "drinking from the bottle" like Conan (not that he needs to to, it's just I literally can't tell because his reaction is not shown to Conan's antics which is 48% of the entertainment value).
Best hot ones episode of ever seen. I've seen a bunch of them
First time conan has made me laugh in many years xD
I feel like this episode was a fever dream
Conan to Hot Ones is Loveless to Shoegaze
21:10 is the greatest moment that has even been on Hot Ones and certifies Conan as America's greatest living comedy host
Conan kinda sad an unhinged now...
He's a mad man
Does anyone else keep thinking he's talking about Max Weinberg when he mentions HBO MAX?
CAMERA GUY BILL AD PLEASE STOP
Conan has always been my favorite late night host of all time.  This is exactly why.
Fcking LEGEND right there 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Conan was incredible. I wonder how much pain he was in by the end
I have never screamed out loud watching Hot Ones until today! This was one of the best episodes ever!😂😂😂
EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!
“These aren’t the rantings of someone who’s had some bad chemicals, and over did it to be funny and relevant to people who are at least 50 years younger than him.  This is a guy who’s just being on a show, and it’s legitimate.”
that was hands down, the greatest episode of hot ones
Conan and Bea Arthur had the same doctor.
I laughed!
Why did I even question the length of this episode? Incredible!
This was great. Definitely my favorite ❤🎉
22:43  That is the exact moment when Conan realizes he messed up. No face could convey that better than Conan's does at this very moment.
Best episode ever. Conan is, was, and continues to be the man. Legend. Man I laughed a lot during this. Thank you for this!
What a fkng tool.
Bravo Conan! 🎉
I know this is YouTube but that was one half hour of perfect television. What a masterclass. There really will never be another Conan.
This isn't just the best episode of Hot Ones, it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
I haven’t laughed this hard in a while, Conan is freaking AMAZING😂👍🏻 what a way to end the season 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I would give anything to have been on this set 😂
"People found that too popular"😂 bro the ending like 5 minutes was hilarious
Lol when you have Conan on it’s not your show no more 🤣
I share the same birthday as Conan!
My God this did not disappoint 😂😂😂❤
The back and forth with the doctor is the best.
the host going " eow my gyashh!!!!😂😂😂😂😂
The look on Sean’s face when Conan took a swig of The Last Dab Xperience to the dome was frightening.
This man is not well...and that is why I've watched him for 30 years
Am I the one who cried on his last monologue. He started as a snob and ended as a slob but he told us to look high and low for humor. Man that hit me hard
Did they get word covid is over so the don't have to use two tables
In Japan you know they're blurring out Conan's mouth this whole episode
I like Conan when he is doing comedy , but i like more when he is being serious and sharing his point of view on many things
Conan is the best! Love him
Conan was not funny here IMO
I love Conan so freaking much! Best episode of the show! Hands down!
100% agree with how Conan describes how the interviewer is a good interviewer.
Please have Conan on your next Holiday Extravaganza! Cheers!
This is the best episode ever🤣 I love Conan
This is peak Hot Ones
😂😂😂
one of theeeeeeee best episode in the entire series
Conan the Barbarian. What a genius.
CONAN IS THE GOAT
Best HOT ONES ever... conan is a comedy legend and genius.... this episode will be the one people talk about when they say "Hey have you watched that chicken wing challenge Hot Ones with celebs.... You gotta watch the Conan one!"
Brilliant! 😂😂😂
He really went all in on that. Amazing!
Good thing he apologized to the buffalo
How many stray cats attacked Conan after leaving this studio with all those scraps in his pocket?
This man is a legend.
The first Hot Ones I clicked on, and clicked so fast 😂 Long live the King! ❤
This is probably the funniest and the most fun of hot ones interview ever 😂😂 thank you Coco!
Conan is king
Did they swap all spices for ketchup and bbq sauce? He didnt shed a tear
The fact that he kept talking after eating Da Bomb is incredible.
That was really weird
My GOAT 🐐
I like the mental image of him trying to come up with arctic tundra jokes
I bet you wish you had s'more now huh
So true about spices & the Irish.  My mom from Boston was 1 of 10 siblings to Irish Catholic parents.  The only spice was salt in our house & at Thanksgiving  thru Christmas, she bought a small tin of dried sage for the 2 holiday potato dressings stuffed in the turkeys.
Legend.
Eye of the tiger, Conan throughout the show❤
Conan is the funniest man alive
after what he did with The Bomb Conan just became my personal hero..... the guy just crushed this interview then yells at Sean..... Are we doing this or not?......Sean was just falling asleep there for a while....Conan had to really liven up this segment....... thank you Conan....you're awesome.
BEST EPISODE .......         E V A R!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He shall be dubbed: Conan Lord Of The Spice
That was nuts.
End it. End the show now. It's not going to get any better than this EPIC EPISODE. The bar is Conan, and NO ONE will beat this. Genius.
This would of been the perfect time to inquire more about the Eartha Kitt incident
Funniest episode ever❤
I laughed so much, something in my body healed, thank you Conan, comedy is truly medicine
Was literally yelling “Conan noooo!!!” Into my phone
Wow I both wanted to throw up.and laugh at the end
Absolute gold.
that man must have studied the 3 stooges, cause I don't know how he ate that much spicy sauce
#1
Unbelievable!  Conan will always be the king of late night.
That man Conan was on Planet Mars after eating the last wing
The best comedy host ever
I love Conan
6 million views in 4 days. 😮
Ugh Conan…I love you. But that was a bit gross.
Built up just like the Scovilles. Outstanding.
23:47 made me cry. So Inspiring! This episode was the definition of Greatness!
Best hot ones ever
Conan unleashed his inner Farley. 😊
Hahahaha this is the best Hot Wings I've ever seen hahahaha
Sean's total Uno reverse power play to Conan as he seamlessly move on to the next genuine question after he stuffs his pockets with eaten wings earned the Valhalla path for Sean. He has only to beat Keaneu Reeves in a fist fight to become The Singularity
The ONLY guest who could top this is Robin Williams, but he is not with us anymore, sadly. Conan takes the cake in First We Feast. Bravo!!!!
Getting a compliment from Conan on your interviewing skill is perhaps the best compliment you’ll ever get. Straight from the greatest of all time
the rooster tail on his head is totally distracting.
I made the mistake of eating while watching this one
Connan just DESTROYED the stage! And became a hero again!!!!......Wing Drop!🍗
Conan was high
I finally believe the claim that redheads feel less pain. Anyone else would have given up the bit earlier, but Conan just took it FOR COMEDY!
Wow. Coco, you the man. Respected by all generations. Only wish you the best!
This is THE GREATEST EPISODE EVER!!!!!!!!
Conan mother fudging O'Brien! One of my favorites for sure.
I didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did 😂😂😂😂
JUST WATCHED IT!!! BEST ONE EVER... COCO IS A BADASS!!
So good
Conan is the man , awesome episode !
Why is the doctors eyes crossed like that haha We Love Conan Obrien
Absolutely incredible. Hilarious, insightful, fun to watch… Conan is unequivocally one of the comedy GOATS.
Best one ever
Da BOMB breaks 95% of people
Conan O’Brien, Gordon Ramsay 🐐
🙌🏻🫶🏻
I love him so much
He got  me laughing. Good episode.
BEST... EPISODE... EVER!!!!!!!
This is the first time that I have seen his guest (I've seen most of these) over killed the sauces in a major way!
"You tried to talk, but your lips have been paralyzed". Laughed so hard at that.
An honest to god Comedic Genius.  People have always slept on Conan but he's the real deal.
OMFG WHAT A BOSS
Honestly my favorite episode ever. Conan gives new credence to the term actor. Wow so awesome!
Hands down the best Hot Ones episode that exists today
Conan is a master of his craft. ❤❤
What a legend this is by far the greatest ep
NBC should be ashamed of themselves. Conan is king of Late Night
My favorite episode by far! I was yelling at my screen. Thank YOU!
Irish people make good food.  And amazing butter.  So don't know about the bland.  What the cheap doctor should have been a doctor.  He knew how to hear the tongue beat.  None of the hot wings went in the top jacket pocket.
Conan is one of the legend... makes a scene more intert and hilariously funny
Easily the best episode I've seen.
Best show ever.  Conan on a Chile high.
conan, eating wings dashed with red water production has specifically bottled" "yikes" viewers: maybe he's a mutant? there's like a gene maybe he doesn't have? is he a literal god?
conan: 100% irish 10% Latino
I think he just surpassed Dave Grohl as most legendary guest
Oh he's going to need to sleep that one off for a few days.
He is the chosen one guys we've found him.
Co Co should be the guest for every season finale. Great episode!
Lolol he is killing me 😮😊
Petition to get Conan to guest host hot ones for the foreseeable future
Conan the king.
Conan and Dave Ramsey crossover!!!
Please do Penelope Cruz 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Haven't watched Hot Ones for awhile. THIS is a great way for me to return! :D
21:05 And... there's my new office computer wallpaper.
What a legend.
The best show in a long time.
All of the spice went into Conan’s legs instead of his mouth
absolute legend
I love Conan but he was pretty rude to take over this episode. it got downright disgusting eventually once you get past his ego. was he coked up?
Am I the only one who's crowd of this kid? Conan is a great get and talk about a mentor. This was so good
This has to be played at Conan's funeral.
i feel like i should watch this in imax. a true life-changing experience.
My birthday is also April 18!!!
What an amazing episode I couldn’t stop laughing.
This is why conan is the GOAT
There's no comment to support the masterpiece of this episode. I have nothing to say, so I'm just here to tip my cap. Incredible.
Conan is a legend
Gold
Absolute legend of an episode.
This is astonishing. Why can't I feel?
This was crazy 🤪 😮
I've never felt less worthy.
Who said white dudes can’t handle spice.
Conan is my spirit animal.
I think Conan wanted to up Paul Rudd.
Wow
I heard Max was coming out with an entertainment Pad they are calling it a Max-E-Pad
Going into this I was like. Meh it’s Conan.  Leaving this episode.  I am impressed.  Great episode
Absolutely hilarious, best hot ones in a long time.
Honestly top 10 episode!
Kevin smith and Jason meewes next!
I don’t typically comment on videos, but Conan is the GOAT. What a performance!
WHY ARE YOU SITTING TWENTY FEET APART?
Conan got high on hot sauce!  😁😂😂. Amazing show!
he just bested Steve-O......OMG...about time you got Conan..TEAM COCO!!!!!
Might as well just end the show here. Nothing will ever come close to topping this. Absolutely amazing
Unbelievable!!  The hottest sauce in this episode is Conan!
This is the first time Shawn was scared for his life.
If this is not the most Classic and Funniest Hot Ones episode… I don’t know which one is!…😂
What's wrong with me. Why can't I feel 😂 COMEDY GOAT
“This one. I’m not going to lie. I’m feeling it a little bit.”  😂😂😂😂
2 min in and I’m already 😭💀
Best episode hands down! Wasnt expecting that
I’ve seen this show it’s Sean & the guest have such a great back in forth, shows where Sean had to carry the guest but this one…Wow! Conan made sure Sean didn’t do any heavy lifting. Instant Top 5 of all time for Hot Ones for sure.
Conan brought his bombastic bushkin with him
Comedy LEGEND!  and yes i'm getting MAX
tbh, this episode really made me realize, Conan is Conan for real lol .
17:14 I audibly laughed out loud!!
Best guest ever! Love you Conan!
How in the heck did he not break 😮
Okay, Conan tops SteveO putting hot sauce in his eye!
Host was shaken AF 21:17
Bro, he friggin, KILLED THAT! This was hands down the best Hot ones ever! I've never seen ANYONE dominate like he did! And that's even counting the ones that didn't seem to flinch at the sauce. He Beasted!
Conan is my hero.
So chaotic! Hilarious episode.
Conan the hot wings Barbarian.   Awesome!!
wierd would think HBO and max would be different wasn't there a company called cinemax?
We share same birthday and same year. Saw his interview after this and he said he burned his face and under wedding ring
Conan is GOAT and killed it on this episode!!😂
Stop eating animals Conan
Being that I’m not quite a year older than Conan, I have to wonder if I didn’t somehow end up on some roadtrip with him. You know, in a small vehicle for hours on end where his physical comedy couldn’t escape the confines of the cramped vehicle with 3 other guys. 😂 😉 I’m always amazed at how funny and goofy he can act while he is honestly a world class brainiac! Rock on dude!
one of the best hot wings ever
This is hilarious
He's an absolute legend! lol
The ABSOLUTE BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!    CONAN  YOUR A BEAST!!!!!!   Sean, I never laughed so hard!!!  At first I thought "Man... Conan must have no idea what happens to people on this show, or what he is going to feel like in a few minutes,  haha...  Has he ever watched this show before?"   I was thoroughly entertained, Sean! Thank you so much!!!
OMFG! Dude is off the chain! Now THAT is entertainment, he probably figured, season finally, got to make it a good one.
He destroyed the toilet after this
Love Hot Ones, love Conan. But that was disgusting.
BEST ONE YET!!!!!
The doctor bits are amazing
This was my favorite Hot Ones EVER! Great show, and Conan is amazing. I can't wait to hear more about this experience on Conan needs a friend!!!🍿🍿🍿🙏🙏🙏
The best one so far
I try but Conan is just not funny to me. Chicken in the pocket? Idk why that should be funny.
love this!
Funniest episode ever
That was the best show yet.
Must be a fun day at work to have your "funny" bit after Conan... I wonder if anyone EVER watches this show beyond the last pose with the guest.
I swear, camera guy Bill is the voice of Baby Brent from Cloudy With A Chance
Who doesn’t like Conan?? Just a good dude all around.
What a legend 😂
This was good lol
Conan is the 🐐
Mf put the wing in his pocket 🤣🤣🤣 love it
Is he high or tired?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
by far one of the best epis!!!
Best one
In the year 2000-24…. Conan slayed the Wings of Death ☠️  😂😂😂
Conan is da bomb...
This was amazing 😭
I felt that "Da Bomb" lick through my laptop screen.
I've watched this countless times now 😂 it's just so good 😂
They always say, never meet your hero’s. I have a feel, Conan was the exception
Oh my god I laughed soooo hard!!!
My favorite episode
The score was great. Whoever did that added so much, absolutely crushed the crescendos. That said, this is a fantastic episode. Conan is the king.
Lol
I have never seen you lose control of the show.  This episode is fricken epic.
Thanks for letting the plebs know sometimes the hot sauce isn’t really hot sauce Conan. He’s for sure not doing the hottest of the hot.
Mfer was absolutely channeling Chris Farley and it was beautiful!
Conan had Covid
We miss you conan when it was good just like old john Stewart. Now all late shows are just marxist propagandist pushing pharmaceuticals for big corp and pushing leftist garbage.
I want a buddy travel comedy with letterman and conan
I just shid
Easily the best episode.
Legend
This is a Hall of Fame episode for sure!!! 🤣 Absolutely love Conan
Sean: Today, we have Conan O'Brien... Conan: No, today we have CONAN THE BARBARIAN!
Conan’s heads here !!!
Best episode ever 👏
I have actually tried the entire gauntlet of sauces. It was with friends and family. Da Bomb hits you like a S#!T BRICK WALL. That is the most horrifying spice I have encountered. For Conan to eat that wing, and dab it is extraordinary. And the shot at the end was insane. Conan the barbarian was actually an Irish man!!!
Conan O'Brian is a true genius of comedy
Best show ever!!!! Not even close
I LOVE LOVE LOVE CONAN
Ive loved so many guests on this show... And they all need to watch this one! I cant stop laughingat this insanity. I said it before, Conan is the best in the game! Sona, come get your boy, hes gonna need help!!!
22:30 litterly me too
Was Conan on something?  He doesn't seem right 🤔
Conan is a great individual. The world is better with him in it
CONAN IS THE MAAAN
Micheal Cera  is a good second
That might have been the best
I've never seen a full episode but when I seen we get 30min with this man getting personal I was all in. I love this man! 😂❤
I fking love Conan O'Brien
I just love this man 😂
by the end i was worried conan was going to pour sauce into his eyes lol
Conan never fails man,  he is very chaotic and amazing
Yeahhh!!!!
This is my 3rd time watching this oneeeee and there will be moreeeee!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It took a lot to land the best ever Hot Ones. But Conan crushed it. #1 hot ones episode. Ever.
go back to haiti conan, i hear its wonderful.
You know I love Sean Evans and the show hot wings. I think his questions are insightful well researched well done. I also like the spicy component of the show with the hot wings. And I would say 90% of the guests on there always feel like I get a better look into who they are as people and also learned about, a deeper history of that particular celebrity. Conan is a little annoying. I know he’s trying to get laughs, but it comes across as trying too hard.
Well done.
Effing most funny show to date!!💥👌👍
The running bit with the Doctor was genius!
The end reminds me of Rick going on a rant about the McDonald's Szechuan sauce on Morty
Coco I love you!! 💗🥰💋💋💋
Idk who was more wild, Conan or Gordon Ramsay
why the heck is he pocketing the wings 😂😂
This episode is pure internet Gold people!!! Pure MFing Gold 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
it was about time you invited GOD to your show :v
Ok. Yeah...best ever
This episode deserves some sort of award. This was absolute comedic genius. The running jokes, the pacing, the timing, this was mother f*ckin gold!
Best episode ever!!!
Conan took over the show in the nicest way possible xD
Conan is a god among men
All these years in, Da Bomb is still undefeated.
CONAN THE INVINCIBLE!
I was here at 6.2 million views.  How long until 1 billion?
It's a little known fact that redheads are more tolerant to pain, and Conan, being the most genetic extreme of gingers, clearly has a the trait.
6:58 Sean gets his flowers 🫡
Conan is the best. He's always so great when on the other side of the desk. He seems to always be at the ready for a quick joke. His career is proof of that. And hes so pale that his eyes look way more bloodshot then usual lol. Love that guy  🍗
Conan is the best late night host. He’s like Conor McGregor minus all the things that make him great.
I love Conan
Love CONAN! He is the only real deal Late Night Host who is realllllyyy funny and intelligent at the same time. After Carson, he is the Man.  CONAN decimated the Hot wings sauces!  - From India 🇮🇳 with Love ❤
How is Conan so much funnier than everyone else on this show?
I'm available next season.
To be honest, sometimes the way he acts is just ridiculous. But how he took those wings was just amazing!!! 😱
Best episode of Hot Ones and pretty much the best guest also. Team Coco always leaves their mark!
I usually don't comment but this time I had to. This has to be the best episode of Hot Ones EVER!!!. Conan is a legend,
Insanity lol
"Plant-based Queso" should be a forbidden term.
16:27
Best episode ever! Also, Conan, I hope you get Karl Pilkington on your travel show on MAX! For anyone who hasn't watched Ricky Gervais's old show "An Idiot Abroad", you will see why he would be PERFECT to have on Conan's new show!
this was unbelievable
Conan is such a G 😂
so good
I can’t stop shouting,- oh my God-! I can’t stop shouting he he’s crazy. He’s insane….he’s Conan the great
Conan is the GOAT. I don't care what anyone else has to say. ALL HAIL CONAN THE GREAT
his willingness to suffer for comedy is unmatched
1:41  Conan: “where did you go to medical school?” Dr. Arroyo: “in 1998.”
Conan the conqueror. This is the best Hot Ones yet.
Best show ever😂😂😂
This is one of the most legendary hot one episodes already!
Ansel Elgort next season?
Genuinely had tears in my eyes watching this.
Amazing as always! When Ansel Elgort gets back to the states could you do an episode with him?
when he drowned that last wing I'm like "nooo wayy" Conans a legend
Da Bomb just committed SUICIDE
Desperately trying Too hard.😮
Conan doesn't know what it's like to give less than 100%.  He is a legend, you won't find anyone that can rightfully say anything negative about this man.
Got real Rick and morty like at the end 😂
This is the greatest episode 👏
Did anyone else take into concern that he's an Irish red head!?   Redheads have been scientifically proven to feel less pain. He's the only one who ever got through like that.  The tongue stethoscope killed me.  Conan is a legend of yesterday but as real and relevant as now.  I didn't have any hot sauce, but I'm choking on my own laughing. Good one guys!
Amazing
Thee best hot ones episode ever I also have fond memories of Conan my sister and I would watch him every night when I was kid he’s the best
This is the best episode ever. What an absolute crazy person😂
I love spice. It must have been hard to sustain.
Conan was the only host during the writers strike to succeed because hes hilarious
lol didnt disapoint one bit
I was laughin😂
During his comedy speech, I stood up in my home and clapped. Bravo Coco
is your audio editor asleep or deaf? The levels are so bad you can barely focus on Conan's voice. 17:30-18:20 is just one example.
I was crying with tears after watching this 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣. Conan is Da Bomb!!!!!  🌶️ 🌶️ 🌶️ 🌶️ 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
Conan O'Brien is INVINCIBLE here!
Did Sean know this was going to happen? So curious to know the true answer because it seemed like not
the king.
Better than Gordon Ramsey.😂
😂😂😂😂😂 he was in flames
His laugh at 31:17 is hilarious
So hilarious
Hey Conan... TRUMP 2024!!!!!!!!!!
HOLLLYYYY SHH!
Conan is a treasure!
This guy is a force of nature. I wish i could be so energetic and charismatic in 30 years.
I’ve watched so many of these, and never have I laughed so hard. Thanks Conan!
I think Conan just ruined Hot Ones for me for any other guest, just like he ruined late night for any other host 😂😂😂.  WING DROP 🍗
Perfect.
hahahahahahaha HAHAHAHAAHAH🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan turned into a shaman unraveling at the seams in minutes, absolutely this episode was traumatizing and enlightening at the same time 😂
Amazing Guest
This has to be the greatest episode of Hot Ones.
How.  Just how.
How is Conan such a legend?
Hands down the best Hot Ones I've ever seen. Leave it to the Great Red One. 25:50 was my daughter's first time ever seeing Conan in any way, and I couldn't be happier. She had a grave look of concern combined with a wry smile, it was perfection. The Large Haired One lives on!
Conan is the Chappelle of "Latenight"  i have never seen a funnier guy as a host .. Dave is a genius of scripted comedy but i think as far as wits , Conan is in his own league.
This probably my favorite episode
did Conan literally DRINK the bottle of pepper? what an absolute BOSS!
Best episode ever that's a high bar godbless Conan Obrian
Connan has acquired an extra 10 years of life doing this bit. Trust.
12:46 i think he says "trying to do the podcast" but they edited it.
Conan is so unhinged 😂
What drugs is he on to do this??? Seriously, im so confused by this. Theres no way..
I've gotten into conan's shows the past two years, and it's really impressive how he commands the stage wherever he goes and makes any scene funny
if asked yesterday, who was the stronger man conan obrian or conan the barbarian, i would have chosen wrong
I was born in the 80s and Conans show was the 1st late night that felt for my generation.... and people don't understand how boring tv was at the time !
Best episode yet! Amazing!
Getting some big Rick Sanchez vibes at the end of the
basically  chugs The Bomb and laughs it off.  {shaking my head}
Bro lost control of his show here. I guess it was entertaining…but these kind of guests are just one schtick after another. Gets old.
The Stethoscope to the tongue, Dr Aroyo! LOL🤣🤣🤣
You should have asked Conan if he would do this challenge in Haiti.
Listen, Conan is funnier than I ever assumed he was 😂 Funniest episode in a while! S/O to Mr. O’Brien & the Affordable Doctor.
You can do better on the thumbnail.
Best ep I’ve seen😂 Conan is awesome
Actual professional. Insane the difference from 99% of hot ones guests
conan's looking old
unhinged!!!!
I am not surprised. Conan O’Brian is a comedic genius. Unlike many Harvard graduates, I can actually tell he indeed graduated from Harvard.
This is a new form of self abuse... even for Conan... Legend.
@23:50 someone needs to edit in doflamingo after he says DonQuixote
History will show this episode to be one of the high-water marks of 21st-century culture!
Might be the first time in hot ones history where the camera was on the guest more than the host, hats off to you conan the days of misery on the toilet were most definitely worth it!
I just love this guy he was my daughter’s favorite funny guy, she even learned how to make that dance he’d do when he started his talk show thrusting his hips with that little dance he’s just awesome , thank you Conan can’t wait for more😂😂😂
I can't describe how amazing this episode was. 100% THE best one yet
he's gonna pay for it later
You should get Noah Kahan on the show!!!
Conan is the man!😊
Wow, I better start checking the celebrity obituaries 😅
I dunno if this one can ever be topped.
Genius ! Goat ! Conan !!
Conan is PURE SHOWBUSINESS
Conan is one of the only likable Late Night Talk show hosts. Kimmel, Colbert, Meyers are all despicable and annoying.
jfc LOL
best hot ones ever. you may as well full send the bit, and it had to be conan.
THIS IS LIFE
I like how Conan starts channeling Lewis Black at the end!!😂
conan screaming for the first time on Da Bomb absolutely was not a coincidence 😂
Sean's face when he says "It's got a build on it, yah yah yah" is priceless
Brilliant!!!!
That guy's going places
Legend.
Not necessarily a Conan fan but this is the best hot ones to date.
Best one yet
This is honestly kinda gross to watch
Never thought Gordon's episode could be topped, but here we are at the peak of Mt Conan. You can call it here. Well done all. There are no more worlds to conquer.
I'd say he's got about 4 years left, tops
There is only one King of Total B S , Conan O'
Best episode ever! Copnan is a beast.
Hilarious, surprising and pretty gross.
Was waiting for the "I'm going to need a real doctor and fast."
It's 3 AM here in Sweden and I think I just woke up my neighbours with my laughter. Conan should do this show 24/7
Conan is the GOAT.
WE F'N LOVE THE MAN, THE MYTH AND THE LEGEND WHO IS CONAN O'BRIAN!!!!
Conan showed up to entertain us that day.
A new bar has been set. Reset the calendar to day zero. Retire the cutting boards. The King has left the building.
Conan knows how to promote. Convinced me to sub to max just to watch his show
Easily one of the best episodes
Pure anxiety watching Conan pour all that hot sauce on!
wipe your face
He chugged the experience, no man should have that kind of power.
Conan is the most cultured person I have seen. So much respect to him !
Wasn’t expecting to watch the best hot ones episode ever but here we are. I mean.. good luck to whoever wants to try to top this one.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Richard Nixon on Conan O'Brien would be hilarious  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
THE BEST HOT ONES EPISODE
I am terrified 😂
Totally channeling Gene Wilder in his closing monologue. Had me rolling in laughter & tears.😭
Master Clown 🙌
it's giving: aries
This was the best episode ever, I was never a Conan fan at all, I think that he just changed my mind!
End on a high note, the should be the end of hotones!!! Best episode ever
Conan = GOAT.   I love what I do for a living, but not as much as he loves comedy.  He went All in.
Love Conan.  Hilarious. Great job to you both.  👏
Comedy at best
I was watching some old Conan remote segments and I realized: he has the personality of a youtuber as a talk show host. If you watch him play VR games in his YouTube VR lab remote segment, he improves exactly like a youtuber or streamer. Truly ahead of his time.
Cherish this man
Love Conan.
Andy was right: don't mess around with water buffalo.  Those things merc lions for *fun*
Instantly, this episode is in the top 5 all time.  Conan. Legend.
He should be a guest host
this will never be topped. this is the goat
This proves it. Conan killed Bea Arthur.
I love conan! He’s the best!!
I think this might be the best one so far.
Bwahahahhahahaha
When Conan did the bomb I covered my eyes
Conan is no punk itch!
The absolute GOAT
Worst interview yet. Conan is just not funny and weird.
Not the Bomb
Conan is crazy for real
Conan os the best. The GOAT. The perfect comedy host. Love this guy.
BEST EPISODE EVER !!!
Love that Conan is willing to say Dave's name but calls hwsnbn'd, the other guy.
Conan is the funniest man alive.
Conan is a funny man
I see Conan is the male equivalent of Meryl Streep because Conan is brilliant with  improvisation just as Meryl Streep is.
ok, now this is my favourite episode FOR EVER .
THE BEST EPISODE THUS FAR!!
The GOAT
Legendary
Easily the best hot ones episode, And probably the inly one where a guest completely controlled the show. Both the host and guest were perfectly attuned to eachother, and delivered a masterpiece. Bravo!
Affordable doctor 😂😂😂
The buffalo story really sets the ambience for what is to come
Conan is brilliant
This is pure gold. To everyone involved in making this happen, outstanding work guys.  You all blew it out of the water. Entertainment value at it's highest!!
What a legend.
The only man who could save late night 😁
Compare this to dj Khaled
When I'm famous enough to be on this show, I'm having a few pitchers of All Day IPA with my wings.
God I love Conan😂😂😂❤
Conan will always be my favorite. I remember watching his first episode as a kid. He's so great. Wrote some of my favorite Simpsons episodes too
His face started out as white as his teeth, ended redder than his hair
The BEST episode EVER! Love CONAN!
I'm watching on wing 3 and I see the bomb in the backround
What amazing personality
Conan is the first real human to experience life. What a boss
Red head people are pscyo
This episode has had me completely in tears laughing. Bravo, Conan. You are comedy incarnate
DJ Khaled brought to shame by a 61 year old, Irish red head.
9:30 ol Coney came with the BITS!!!👏👏😂
Conan ain't fxxxing around...
I love hot ones
Effortlessly funny
Amazing😂
This one's an all-time classic, right up there with Gordon Ramsey's. Conan dominated like no one ever has on this show, and effortlessly. It's so insane that he drank from the bottles.
This is without doubt the greatest episode of this show in history.
The shot at 23:50 as it pans up from the spilled hot sauce bottles to Conan just drenched in hot sauce is magnificent
God this is the funniest episode I've ever seen. What a performance.
The single most entertaining episode in all 24 seasons!  HANDS DOWN!
My new favorite episode!
This escalated so slowly
What. An. Absolute. Maniac. 😂
Best hot ones ever ❤ love you my Conan
This is THE best episode of hot ones I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of them. Conan is KING. His voice has been the soundtrack to my life and I adore him.
This is the best one.
That was amazing!
He was, is and will be… an absolute LEGEND
this is the best epsode ever
Bageebus he’s tall!
This has to be the greatest episode of Hot Ones EVERRRR !!! WAOOOO
OMFG! Im crying😂
BEST...HOT ONES...EVER
Amazing performance out of a legend.
‘You say this is pure pepper?’😭🤣
Conan was truly in pain but he knew what the stakes were and he wanted to deliver.
One of the best things I’ve ever seen.
Ok................THIS WAS THE GREATEST FWF EPISODE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Legendary.
This is the funniest thing i have seen on the internet in yrs thanks so much!
This was the top. Well done to both of you morons! can't wait to see more from ya!!!
Conan!! Now you need to go on chicken shop date!
can this ever be topped?? Ever??
Conan is on a league of its own when it comes to talk show hosts 🤣
Do we know if Conan survived the interview or if he died shortly after ? I NEED TO KNOW HE SURVIVED THE HEAT.
This guy’s a menace
How anyone finds him funny is beyond me
Oh sweet baby Conan, can we get an R.i.p. for his toilet 🚽🪠
I don’t think Sean has ever laughed so hard in his life
Conan went hard af and I respect him for that
Respect. At last a guest that gets the show
There's funny and there's crazy. Turns out, I wasn't ready for crazy here, it's panful to watch... Could anyone from Conan's family please, PLEASE confirm whether he's OK after this?
amazing
Conan effortlessly takes the title of the funniest person to ever appear on this show.  Honorable contender for funniest person of all time too!
No sell it.  You are the Haku of Hot Wings!
I'm waqtcdhing the end with Conan's face covered in sauce, and all I want to do is wipe my own face! 😁👍😎✌🗽
Da Bomb remains the best equalizer of all men...lol
Lol Conan goes off the rails 13:30
Epic!
I dont know if this made me like Conan more or less lol
Mother f**ker literally drank the last dab. Conan is wild af
Easily the best guest in history on this show
Finally!!
"A Mad magazine is funny" - words of wisdom! ❤😂
Now you are almost ready for my level.  Minium sauce 2 million scoville.  Don't even try anything else.
This is inspirational...
Conan blew it with his insanity at the end.
Conan is so good. Great guest to finish off the season.
I haven't laughed out loud to a video this hard in a long while. This has to be a top performances ever type moment.
BEST GUEST EVER!! AHAHAHA
that's what spice do to white ppl
The Man is an Absolute Lunatic !
Conan as a guest was everything I hoped and knew he’d be.
I wish we had HBO Max in the UK hopefully Conan's show gets released on DVD region 2.
Conan is the GOAT of Hot Ones!! 🔥 👏🏼
Can we see the uncut please?
This was the best finally!!!
BEST HOT ONES SHOW BY FAR >>> CONAN THE BARBARIAN INDEED !
“do you mind if i”
If only Norm Macdonald could have been part of this!
Johnny and Steve O would be jealous of Conan
Conan hilarious as usual! Best show yet.
I dont know why but somehow Conan more and more like Elon Musk
I’m so confused 🫤
ah yes
I started seeing coco as Rick Sanchez somewhere through this and I can't unsee it. Amazing.
Lol the doctor
Dr. Arroyo - not the best but very affordable.
Conan is a Legend man I remember watching Late Night with Conan in the 90's it pushed the envelope on so many things pimpbot the bating bear...what an era 🤣🤣
Legend.
lol conan is crazy i love it
23:29 Wise words from a wise and stable man. What an episode.
this show always reminds me that spice can intoxicate you lol
watched hot ones since the beginning. This is the best episode. If Brett doesn't put Conan at number 1....
i cant believe people think this is real 😂 they dont know Conan 😂
We have a new champion folks, I’m still trying to figure out what I just witnessed?!😳😂
King
Conan has always been GOAT'ed, but I'm glad the new generation can appreciate him.
Conan is the perfect mix of slapstick, serious, and witty comedy.
25:01 😂😂😂😂 the speech at the end 😂😂
Idk if I've ever been more invigorated for the passions of life than having a funnyman interview spitting and screaming at me through the camera about his love of comedy in the Bible and Mad Mag.
Interesting, after enough spice Conan starts to sound like Nathan Lane. lol
Bro what the F did I just watch 😂
Greatest episode ever.
I'm 50 and I can say Conan is the greatest TV personality of my lifetime.
21:00 this man is something else
This man is insane
That was great to see Conan once again he is legendary
Man I miss his show so much
Conan, the GOAT.
The greatest ever...
The Conan hair shake 😂
Wow
Absolute perfection
Greatest.Episode.Ever! Conan didn't even break a sweat!
I’m here for the spontaneous Louis Black impersonation at the end.
Gross.
How is this gone exactly how I pictured it in my mind, yet it built a huge laughter on me?  Also, I suddenly realized that when Sona said on the podcast that Conan brushes his teeth so violently you would think he deeply hates himself, yeah, maybe she was not joking
Great episode.  It's a shame that Conan's brand of comedy can't win the late night gig he deserves.  He is one of the greatest.
Best one yet. By far!
This is the best Hot Ones ever!!! Conan is amazing!
The massive amount of liquid grossness on his face once he's fully committed to the bit made this hard to watch. I've watched Conan since '94 and to see him like this was... unnerving. But after some time and distance, I realize it's just quintessential Conan genius.
I’d love for DJ Khalid to explain to Conan why he quit after 2 wings. Lol
Conan is my hero!!!
No way he's Irish if he could obliterate those wings.
brilliant
I’ve never seen a guest completely disrespect what Sean Evans does. He brings on guests to ask non-standard questions. Conan chose to make this all about him at the expense of the show’s format and integrity.
Sean! This Sean! Says best show ever! Conan is the man!! huge big first on the hot ones, no one has ever done that. lol
Conan , after decades of an unrefined tongue until 52 - spice has no effect😂
WE DON'T DESERVE CONAN. HE IS NOT MORTAL.
Conan settles for nothing less than being a legend! 😂
BEST. EVER. 😂
whats with the two seperate tables
Conan is the goat hahaha
“He has an office in the desert” haha. You could so see how Conan was a Simpsons writer in their glory years. What a comedic mind.
Conan sounds like a wonderful person. I truly hope this isn't a lie because I get very impressed everytime he recalls past crew members by name, and many times with a very vivid recollection.  Most don't know the crew they are working with right now. He truly is a people person.
Next show: Conan needs a straight jacket :D
This was the best guest on this show so far…absolutely hillarious!
i only know this guy for writing the best Simpsons episodes how long have i been missing out on this
Conan's face at 23:00 😂😂😂, his eyes haha
That was intense! Conan’s as funny as ever
This was probably the best interview ever done on First We Feast.
Are we sure Conan came on to eat wings and not the scenery?
I don’t want to watch his show, but I HAVE to after watching him go through this.
I love, and also HATE that Conan ate maaaaaybe 15% of the actual wing. Lol
OMFG this was,… “IS” the best episode yet… Conan is flipping awesome
Best one yet! Do you have to pay for his Emergency room doctor bill? And then whatever medical emergency comes next?
5:13 improv with a sheet of ice LOL 😂😂😂
ngl this is probably the best interview yet
I was not expecting this 😂
Wow BuzzFeed buying… 26:22
Got that smoking, aces calf skin jacket, leather calf skin jacket going on
Conan DOMINATED on all levels. That's what "show time" mode looks like! Genius.
This is the best hot ones interview I’ve ever seen 😂
22:30 "What's wrong with me? Why can't I feel~?!" 😭 lool
Hero!
This is the funniest thing on the internet, amen.
Perfect!!! About time!
Funniest episode I’ve seen in a long time.
Hats off to Conan... my man
Zenith reached for this show. ggwp.
I love Conan so much, this was insane
there is only one Conan O'Brien!
God I wish I had this man’s energy
finally coco!
Conan is a professional! What a guy.
I just... WHAT DID I JUST WATCH?  How can it ever be better than this? Conan didn't raise the bar, he picked it up and ejected it into outer space. Amazing.
I love Conan so much. You know, national treasure is thrown around a lot when talking about celebrities, but I truly believe Conan is an American treasure. ♥️
This went EXACTLY how i thought i would, once i saw it was conan.
Absolutely unhinged.
conan is a true showman and an admirable gentleman
21:00 I almost spit out my drink 😂 I had to pause it
my dog, max. see max run!
What… the… f*ck??? How did he do that
Little did we know that Conan was an ABSOLUTE UNIT, when it comes to devouring hot sauce :D
Conan the best hot ones guest of all time!!  See ya on Max!!
There's a 95% chance this jacket belongs to Jordan Schlansky
CALL THE WIFE!
He suddenly grew his beard back for a moment.
THE GREATEST EPISODE EVER
EPIC. absolutely demolished the wings AND hot sauces. Wild.
They should've blurred out his disgusting mouth the last couple minutes
Why the two tables ? Very impersonal. Show was better when the guest sat in the same table.
I think this was the first time we went from eating a wing to eating another one without any questions from Sean in between
Still a goat
Love this guy 🫡
I felt Robin Williams vibes here. Wow. Conan you seem free here, no late night format restrictions seem to do you well brother ...
A little too much for me. Hard to watch.
"very good, Very inexpensive" words never uttered before about the US healthcare system. 7:54
I loce this man truly an icon. I cannot think of another interview guest that was more entertaining to watch.
What a beast.
MY GOD what a LEGENDARY performance
😂😂😂
savage
This is like the David Blaine and Gordon Ramsay episodes mixed together.
It has to be the BEST interview ever!!!
Conan is and will forever be my favorite. Miss him on late night. In fact I don’t watch anyone else.
I wanna see an interview of him when the wings come out the other end 😂.
Un-be-lie-va-ble.
We are priveleged to be in the midst of Legends!
Conan had to be the best guest ever. Even while BS'ing that it wasn't affecting him, he still took them all like a champ. I was worried he was going to touch his eyes for a minute there though.
one of the funniest people ever
Absolutely insane - everything I hoped for 😂❤
That foreplay with the sauce I can't 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Conan❤
Best Hot Ones interview ever!
legend
Might as well end the show here, cuz it ain't getting any better than this one!
Wow wow and wow.... now that’s how you do hot ones.... fair play 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏
I think we need t-shirt merch with "Where did you go to medical school? 1998" lol
I hope he doesn't touch his eyes for the next 4 days 😂😂😂
Never laughed so hard!! This was great!!
"Smokey J. I feel nothing."  04:22, wipes snot from his nose.
Conan, I love your work so much. Much love to you and your family.
I love Conan's descent into madness in the latter half of the show. He totally took this episode over, and it was such perfect chaos.
I just want to call this…… Conan is the GOAT I’d love to hang with that man.
I have been watching this channel for years, resisting the subscribe button. But you got Conan and he subverted expectations and just dominated the interview while squeezing the funny out of every second.      How could I not subscribe?
this is why connan is the GOAT!!!!! team COCO
Genius comedian, masterful host!
I’m so confused how he isn’t fazed by these.
And the award to the Spiciest of Spicelords goes to....I'm dying rn.
🔥
The GOAT !
He's not going gentle into that good night.
Conan seems a little PCP'd up today
Did anybody else have a physical reaction just watching this video? My mouth and stomach were burning. My God, Conan, you are insane. 🥵🥵🥵
I doubt anyone will ever be able to top this episode as Conan dominated every wing. Not only did he eat each one.  He even added more sauce just because he could!
Ok, so he's now the Hot Ones GOAT. What's next?
This is a test comment, I love typing comment
He literally vomited, no? Why is no one talking about this
Without a doubt, one of the best episodes. Conan is a national treasure and I'll definitely be watching his new show from that guy Max
Lol conan is a legend best guest ever by far and definitely the king of the hot one hill 👌
Love Conan. Never disappoints 😂😂😂😂
This is the best Harvard can do
Absolutely love Conan he’s the best late night host ever, and to see him on hot ones is a dream come true wish all love ❤
Conan has never been this red since staring at Nicole Scherzinger's melons or from the evil scrub of Mr. Lee
Conan makes Ice Spice look even more lame.
I don’t hit the like button on Hot Ones, cuz they’re doing okay. I don’t comment on Hot Ones, cus there is plenty. I did both on this one. Conan knows my GenX sense of humor and HE DELIVERED!!!
this is what it's like to get high off capsaicin lol AND I LLLLLOVE IT
GOAT
I knew this would be good even before watching it
The most legendary episode by far. Conan is a comic genius. That meltdown was absolutely primal lol
The best episode hands down. Never seen anyone take da bomb like that🤣🤣🤣
If you really wanna commit to the bit, go rub one out bare-handed in the green room without washing your hands.
Beyond legendary
I just don't find Conan O'Brien funny at all. He's trying to be, but fails terribly.
Conan is a legend and this is just proof
That was the best hot ones of all time
Next he can eat BBQ in Haiti
Is that guy even a real doctor
The laugh in the background when he puts the wing in the pocket for me pretty good
Lol tell him to go back to Haiti and try and prove Trump wrong again about how nice it is over there. That one guy barbecue might make things real spicy there for him
I love how no matter who he's with or what he's doing Conan is always the same man we know and love
This is the first time I'm witnessing Sir Spicealoads NOT matching totally with the guest. I definitely expected Sean to stick those bones in the jacket. ...my life is a lie.
That was really good 😂😅
Conan belongs on the Mt Rushmore of late night hosts. No one will top this. He almost has a Chris Farley or Robin Williams energy.
One of your best shows yet!!!
Eerily similar to Homer eating Wiggum's Quetzaltenango chili, memba? check Conan for candels..
Conan broughts cringiest vibe to the show
My lord! Conan committed fully. He starts off saying he is Irish and can’t handle spice and then is saying none of the spices are spicy . When he dumped the atomic bomb sauce on I thought he just unalived himself. Have to admit I was kind of grossed out at the end with the drool and food all over his face but I respect it. I expected at any minute he was just going to dump the pitcher of milk and water all over his head or something. The doctor bit was funny. The guy looked really familiar.
What a brilliantly unhinged guest. TENS across the board.
Lol 😂👍
This was legendary
Jesus Christ Conan must be inhuman to just... not be fazed by DA BOMB. And oh my god just annihilating The Last Dab. This man is not a mortal being, and no one will top this episode.
His hair reminds me of  There's Something About Mary movie
Aren't redheads supposed to have some sort of genetic resistance to pain in the first place?
Incredible 😂😂😂😂
I have been a Conan fan for over 25 years. This episode made me laugh harder than any other episode of Hot Ones! 11/10
Conan’s a legend.  I’ve never seen somebody drink hot sauce.
This was one of the best!
Conan is the only late night host left with his humanity in check. Seems like a really genuine guy.
I wish they kept filming Conan after this interview and put it on Max. Him suffering while the doctor just fails to help..
Respect for Conan, man did it with a smile on his face, all for the skit
Conan continues to be the king of comedy. Legend
Keep Conan away from talking coyotes!
Watching Forrest obliterate Chuck was the best part of my day today.
the commitment to the bit is what makes him unmatched
Haha nice 👌  i like conan
This was a different kimd of hot takes. Fellow O'Brien is a genius
This is going to be your most viewed episode ever. Its a fact. Maybe it is already? TOP TOP COMEDY GOLD, waaaay overdue!!!
Conan is my favorite
I am 100% sure they have stopped eating actual hot sauces on this channel. As they've moved from having C-/D-list celebrities towards more A-listers it's felt very obvious the sauces arn't as hot any more.  It sadly makes me lose  in the show. Sure, having more famous people must be great for the production, but the soul of the show is completely gone.  Hoping for a turn for the better next season.
such a breath of fresh air after the Ice Spice episode
Conan aging nicely into playing Donald Trump in a few years.
Im not surprised at all, but Conan has become the best gest on this show ever! Those pocket wings killed me!
#1 Best episode ever!
Американцы не очень изменились за сто лет))) У Конана хорошее здоровье, я рад за него)))
DADDY COCO 🤤
Conan has always been the best
EPIC!!!!😂😂😂😂
Did he just mow through the whole spice levels for real?  That was awesome.
handsdown one of the best hot ones ever im rolling with laughter
Why I can only hit the like buttom once?
Funniest episode ever
The best
Conan O' Brien is a big personality of a person. I like how he is cool with being funny where it takes him as he is reading the people around him as he does it. I think he is the perfect person to have for a season ending episode for Hot Ones.
Nice to have a talk show host with a personality
Redheads can withstand more pain than most people!
Best Da Bomb reaction ever. Hysterical. "COME ON, MAN! ARE WE DOING THIS OR NOT?!! ARE WE DOING IT OR NOT?!!! WHAT'S THE POINT OF EVEN BEING ALIVE IF WE CAN'T DO THIS??? ... This one, I'm not gonna lie, I'm feeling it a little bit."  Me: Crying laughing. 😆🤣😆🤣
Hands down the best episode ever. Bro nailed it and absolutely aced it.
What, i didnt even know, my bday is day after, account for timezone difference & we share it
The dying western world!
Man! Best. Guest. Ever.
there has never been a better episode!!
Conan is a national treasure probably
demon can´t keep his mask on forever
The exact opposite of Ice Spice
Dr arrayo is basically the new aaron blazer
All new respect for this BEAST of a man. Conan, you go where we can not follow.
Conan must be Clinically Insane!
he  is about to get reder
that was such a nice shirt......was
Best guest ever
I think they need to give him a championship belt, or/and have him committed.  Seriously though I think he's the new Hot Ones champ.
how on earth this guy eat wings
"...Charlie Rose show where you eat hot wings." Fantastic description of this show. And a subtle compliment to the high level of questions Sean and Chris come up with, and the smooth way Sean interviews.
This guy's the man finally 🙌  hahah
Well. No one is gonna beat this level of pure unbothered.
A national treasure.
Bro is having a mental breakdown
This is absolute gold!!
Dude idk why but all hours of the day my entire life Conan O’Briens humor makes me absolutely cackle.
I’m not a big O’Brien fan but this has to be the greatest episode ever
I love Conan 😩 he’s brilliant and hilarious and kind. What else could you ask for
Conan is the best host ever was and will be :)
DRINKING THE SAUCE!!!???? WHAAAAAAAA
Me: NO, CONAN! NOT ON YOUR SHIRT!!!  🤣🤣🤣  He had me laughing so hard throughout the whole thing. The man is insane.
CONAN IS NOT HUMAN!!!!
Dude until conan said that he was feeling da bomb a little bit, i was worried that maybe he's suddenly got a medical condition XD
this was the best episode of hot ones by far!
Gordon Ramsay move over, here's Conan!
"You're not a real doctor, are you?"  "I should be" 😂😂😂
The best ever 😂
nobody better than Conan. Jay was a tool, Dave was great but Conan is the all time best late night host in history.
Is that Robert Patrick in a red wig?
Why is Conan eating from right to left?
"I dont fear your wings, man.." That was perfect..
Out of his mind...
Awesome guest Shawn, great show!
What’s hilarious is my first thought is that there should be a medical team on standby and literally 12 seconds later the Dr bit is introduced..  10 out of 10 on seizing the comedic moment.
best episode ever!, absolute madlad!
"Read widely". That's just genius! I'm a huge fan of British comedians, and they tend to come off as well educated. Maybe they just fool me because of the accents and vocabulary I'm not familiar with sometimes, but they genuinely seem well educated. That said, American and Canadian comedians are also just great thinkers! You have to be in order to subvert expectations to make us laugh! I really didn't watch a whole lot of Norm MacDonald before his unfortunate passing, but he's become one of my favourites (and was one of the few guests on Conan's show that could make him just belly-laugh throughout). He was brilliant, even if his style was very blunt. I'm positive that the guy was way smarter than anyone gave him credit for, aside from the people who knew him closely.
APPLAUSE !  That was SUPERMAN level commitment !  I CANNOT handle the hot stuff like I used to… I’ve purchased very VERY hot sauces in the past… but those sauces PALE IN COMPARISON to what’s produced nowadays. So could I complete the Hot Ones challenge ?  Maybe… I’d probably have serious difficulty with the last two… But  no way could I even come close to the superhero level feat we all just witnessed Conan O’Brien complete !  My hat and cape is off to him !
HES POCKETING THE CHICKEN!!!!🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
My birthday twin 🎉
G O A T
wow, conan is the best
Conan is classically funny in a way alot of people aren't anymore. You love to see it.
BEST GUEST SO FAR
Didnt like him before this but he owned it. Great entertainment
Never seen Sean giggle like this. Best episode hands down.
Hot Ones Hall of Fame easy
An absolute mad man lol
This man does not age it's crazy!
One of the best episodes! Perfect for the season-ender!
Why are they so far apart?
This is what happens after a visit to an Illuminati party
K, he earned me watching his new show.
Wow. Conan. 100% the most entertaining hot ones interview. Well done. I couldn't stop laughing at the end. Commit to the bit indeed.
Conan is a true wingman.
CALL THE WIFE!!!
Conan is the GOAT. 🤣
This is the best interview I've watched on this show to date. Thanks Conan for the great fanatics, and thanks Shawn for the being "..a great F**kin host!"
This has 4× the views Shakira one has which came out a week earlier.  Legend
Conan, Jim Carrey, and Tom Green created my sense of humor lol. Loved this
Wow.
HANDS DOWN THE BEST ONE!!!!❤🎉😮😂
oh man i love u conan haha
Who is the HOST???😂😂😂
Conan O'Brien is the absolute GOAT
Easily the best hot ones ever.
Thumbnail made me think this was a YTP for a second lol
I think he stroked out
We have finally found the episode that is on the complete opposite end of the Khaled Spectrum
Conan had some major Chris Farley energy in this one.
How this show became this successful is beyond me. An unoriginal concept and a boring host. It's basically just a vehicle to sell hot sauce.
Seeing Conan go to town on DaBomb was certainly something.
Top 5 episode ever!!!!!  Hilarious!
Conan O'Brien is perhaps the best guest this show has ever had. Icon 😂
I wish I could order to Latvia those sauces. I see Lithuania (neighboring country) in the shipping, but no Latvia (Europe). I would gladly order a Season box.
19:09
I haven’t seen someone so in control of their body in a hot ones since David Blaine. Conan held his composure completely, it’s just that his natural state is being unhinged and Blaine’s is stoicism.
Just amazing!!! Makes me think it's all props lol...
this guy is funny af , he should have his own show
This man is a national treasure 😭
That was AMAZING. He took the crown in every way possible.
Conan's commitment to the bit is bar none completely unparalleled by anyone else in the comedy world.
Legendary Episode...this is the peak....it's all down hill from here...just retire here
Legend.
I couldn't even breathe from laughing so hard from beginning to end. Best episode ever. But I got sad at the end because it reminded me of late night back in the day- Conan, Leno, Letterman, Craig Ferguson. Now we got Colbert, Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon.
Gotta give it to him, he’s def an entertainer.
All the thumbs downs are Jay Leno fans.
What a hero
This was absolutely incredible. What a legend!!!
Conan raised the bar higher than anyone will ever reach.
One of the absolute best guests! Well done!
18:31 the face of regret.....
Well that raised the bar for future guests!
Was this staged? He can't have had this much hot sauce and not gone mad... oh I think I just answered my own question.
Bravooo❤❤
After witnessing what he just did the water buffalo story doesn't sound crazy at all!
😂 Absolute legend. 🎉
Conan is the GREATEST
Apparently hosting late night comedy is the emotional equivalent of downing a couple of Carolina Reapers every night.   Insane pain tolerance by Conan.   Willing to take comedy and Scovilles beyond normal human limits.
Best One Ever! Whole new respect for Conan!
Conan is the opposite of Khaled. My god, what a beast.
Every time Conan says Max, I think he's talking about Max Weinberg from his old show.
Love Conan! He's the best
BEST episode ever!!! Amazing skill in improve comedy! Conan is the goat!!!  Well done sir!!! Time well spent, that I’ll never ask for a second back!!!
CONAN THE GOAT 🐐🗣️🗣️💯💯🔥🔥🔥
I'm glad Conan decided to interview Sean!
LEGEND
My favourite line was actually “you say this is pure pepper?”
Suomi mainittu, torille!
I think this might be the best episode of Hot Ones ever made.
This is probably the best hot ones I have ever seen. Conan is an absolute legend!
Top 3 episodes
I think Conan one Hot Ones.
Conan is a machine???
Conan is the best talk show host ever
This s is bananas!  Conan is a legend.  "I'm fine!"
I would like Dr. Arroyo's contact info. Very impressed with his doctoring skills.
Best hot ones ever hats off
Pure Awesomeness. Great job Conan.
Conan's a beast!
Quite possibly one of the funniest videos Ive ever seen!
love canon
I grew up with Conan. He is a legend. Always has been. Always will be. But even still, watching this... holy effing Christ, WOW!
You gotta love Conan!! He's always good time.
conan the king
He's very affordable 😂
Easily your best episode ever.
Conan needs to be the 3rd companion when Sean and chili Klaus get together
Conan doing a very good Martin Short in some of these moments.   Gotta say, even if we completely lose Conan to senility... I'll watch.
That.  Was.  Amazing.
Let's go!!
Conan really put hot ones on his back with this one, old school class clown comedy still hits and Conan proves it time and time again. Might be the greatest Hot Ones episode of all time!
Best episode ever
Conan, Conan!!
That was incredible!
The only late night host I ever laughed with. Goat
Leave it to Conan to do the greatest episode to date this dude is epic….😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
BEST. HOT ONES. EVER!!!!!!!!!
They should have started with Taco Bell mild sauce.
Invinted the word crunk
Conan has the most magnificent stage presence
How is this even possible? This may be the greatest feat of physical endurance since Ali survived 15 rounds against Frazier in Manila.
😮😅😂 this was so exciting.
you know what they say, the spice must flow
Conan is so intelligent, even his humour is smart.
Has everyone seen another guest drink hot sauce?
This one goes HARDDDD hahahah
4:43 Suomi mainittu - Torille! Go Finland!
I adore Conan
Conan was once a Simpson’s writer. He took down those wings like Homer in the chili contest in S8:E9. Did he chug wax from a candle ahead of time to prepare for this like Homer did?
I can’t believe it, CONAN!!!!! King of heat!
How did Conan hold a glass of water, then instantly a glass of milk? This episode was hilarious
Best one yet!
Ok, first off, mad respect to Conan for diving right into the deep end. But, Jesus Christ I feel sorry for his toilet bowl that night.
This was a master peice of comedy.
"CONAN" Mic drop.....
Noone can make me laugh like Conan. There has never been a funnier guy on TV or on the internet
That was amazing.
This man is an absolute gem. We must protect him at all cost
This goes down as your best one without a doubt. Yes Gordon Ramsay's one was iconic but I've never seen any of your guests bring this level of energy. Conan is one of a kind I was laughing/had a smile on my face throughout
Never laughed harder for one of these episodes hahahaha.  I've tried Da Bomb and it's sooo hot, cant imagine he did this!
Still the best… he’s still the best. Team Coco!
Yes if ur wondering, he's on drugs😂😂
Conan is insane 😂
"Call the wife!"....BWAHAHAHA
I have been laughing the entire episode... epic
🤣🤣🤣
If Dr. Arroyo AND Reverend Shnorr aren't on the guest list for next season then...well...i guess I'll just watch whoever's on.
Conan turned into the joker
Conan O’ Brian DIES eating spicy wings
18:30 Sean didn’t do enough research on this one, Conan literally can’t stop, he even made a whole movie about it lol
By far the best episode ever!
Conan is the GOAT!!!!!
This is why Conan is king. A true devote to the bit. Not just the bit, but the bit within the bit within the bit. Absolute legend
Mad respect.
I weep for Conan’s colon. Best episode by far!!
Best hot ones ever
Conan is a national treasure.
Best Episode EVER!!!
Conan got a higher Scoville than any of those sauces.
This has to be the best episode yet😂
CALL THE WIFE!!
He is almost too good. I do love him, but need a bit more drama to be reminded he is out there!
Best one yet.  Never knew Conan was so full of wisdom.
Aggressively rubs da bomb into every pore of his tongue “This one, I’m ngl, I’m feeling it a lil bit”
This guy is a maniac!
In an alternative Batman universe this is how the Joker was created.
Conan gave himself COVID to survive the wings of death, he has no taste 🤣
Amazing
Pocketing the wings is a power move
That was great 😂
Conan about to spend the next week  on the toilet  screaming & burning and his wife gonna move to the guest room and see him on the opposite  end of a hospital visit 😂😂
Sean it’s ok to let loose sometimes
Stunning
love how Conan accidentally harnessed a Dana Snyder impression by the end
He should get his doctors from his favourite safest country Haiti.
Wow... just wow. Respect Conan lol
Jesus 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
wow that was insane lol
He ate the sauce, the wings, the host and this show
Conan turned full coverage makeup red...that man was ON FIRE!!! He's such an underrated legend.
I love Conan but chill out on the makeup.
Based on this video and seeing him not being phased by any of the hot sauce, we can safely conclude that he'd lost his sense of taste from covid. 💀💀
Conan has always been fantastic... In the year 2000 Conan will beast on Hot Ones
this was the best one yet
Wow. I haven’t laughed or been that interested in a guest in I don’t know how long. Bravo Sean, just let him go! Masterclass from both
He is the official King of HotOnes
Conan just threw down the gauntlet as the best episode ever. Gordon Ramsay had been dethroned...  This had me in tears laughing from beginning to end, his eyes at the end say it all with the pain
I've never felt sick to my stomach watching TV until this episode of hot ones. Great television!!
GOAT.
Why are there two tables??? Looks like Conan is a germaphobe
What is the point of serving food with a dressing/condiment which renders it almost inedible? You may as well cover the wings in paint stripper as it seems to serve the same purpose.  I don't understand?
5 mins in and Conan's already the best guest to ever do this
This was beautiful!
Love it! Conan made it his own show!
What a legend, Conan
You are a real one Conan
23:00 - 23:05 meme material 😂
Poor Conan, eat that much ~2million Scoville and you'll feel like you've been bitten by a snake for hours afterwards. Hats off.
Id pay money just to hear Conan curse for hr straight
Legend.
you guys really have to cut out or at least cut back on the soundtrack. it's so out of place and surreal
This is the guest I’ve been waiting for since a long time. And oh gosh by golly did it not disappoint, pure hilarious chaos.
I like Conan, but that was annoying and predictable. I don't watch this show for it to be a bit for someone.
Clean the wing ❌ Take it home for leftovers ✅ Conan a diff breed
I wonder if people that get celebrities on their show ever get any business opportunities from these wealthy high profile figures
What he actually needs is some integrity and sense of humour
Amaizing energy,, conan is a great comedian
best hot ones EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the best episode by far, EVER.
I was missing Conan and glad so see him again
I love this man❤😂😂😅
Hands down top 5 episodes. Just great😂
We need a RUDD vs CONAN Truth or Dab!
Never seen Sean so concerned lol. Conan is a lunatic!
I'm just now realizing that Conan and Joel Edgerton bear a resemblance.
This guy is funny, he should be a comedy show host.
Is Conan still alive?
“Dr. Arroyo, can you please check my pulse” “It’s there”
Greatest episode ever
Conan 2nd to none
God I love this man
That was the most unhinged episode yet, and I absolutely love it. Great season finale
I love this guy
Oh my gawd, I laughed so hard I was gagging too. LOL 🤣 By far the best episode to date!!
Dr. Arroyo isn't a real doctor is hilarious
My 2 all time favorite shows at once !!! Eeeeeeeepic! ❤🎉😂
That was the best and most insane thing I have ever seen. Conan has always been the best, and this was like watching the Joker.
He’s ruining his guts while being like YOU DONT HAVE THE GUTS, GUTS  That’s show business, apparently
Conan’s the man. I hope he’s vein enough to be reading these comments so he can see I called him The Man
Expected nothing less from Conan
THE GOAT
One of the best late night host, miss the guy.
Bravo Conan! Encore!
WE WANT Jordan Schlansky!!! Jordan Schlansky!!! Jordan Schlansky
Has there ever been a better guest? I loved seeing Sean bust up for 30 minutes, struggling to get his questions out and finally just letting Conan take the show where it went. Great, Great GREAT episode, and a perfect end to the season!
Sean was in tears too he was losing it right before "I'M FINE"!
What did I just watch?!?!?!?!?!
Petition for Conan to host at least 1 Hot Ones Episode per season
I’ve never laughed so badly
Yo I actually tried da bomb, it’s messed up
The spicier it got, the crazier Conan got 😂
Incredible. Just an incredible episode.   2 professionals intelligently conversing over hot wings while I watch over a plate of chips with nacho cheese.  Top tier content! At this age and Conan taking all that hot sauce and being such a good sport.  1 of the best episodes ever, hands down.
Long time Conan gan. He was the best night show host I grew up with (I'm 28). He knows what people find funny. He knows how to let the conversation flow and just wnd up where it ends up. Best Hot Ones guest of all time.
Conan is such a true professional. Born and bred comedian through and through
shawn really struggled with leading this lolll this one has made it to my top next to shaq for sure.
best episode ever.
Meanwhile, Conans practically bleeding from the eyes.. 😅
I love tf outta Conan. Him and Craig Ferguson were the last great late night hosts
Could be the greatest episode of all time!
There's absolutely no chance that this is legit though. I mean, what's the point in this show if it's just fake.
You might want to think about, "Hey, have I ever seen anyone ride this type of animal?" before attempting to get on something like a water buffalo.  Just a hunch I had while watching this.
This is the best hot ones ever!!!
We have witnessed history here.
I think there is no way to ever top this. You've maxed out your show, guys.
I've never been more impressed by a man
I love Conan, such a funny and smart guy.
NBC ditched Conan ...one of the TOP TWO late night hosts ever (Conan & Letterman) from the Tonight Show, ...for the phoniest, most unwatchable fool to EVER be a late night host. Jimmy Fallon is literally the worst, unfunniest person to EVER be shown on a television.
Best hot ones yet! Conan was hilarious as always
Can I say this was inspiring
Best one ever! I had to stop a few times, I was laughing too hard after da bomb to hear anything.
You know his assistant was pissesd when he put that wing in his pocket 😂
Oh my goodness gracious Conan just broke the mould!
Best episode ever
That was the most controlled chaos on an episode ever.
Conan is the goat. A bygone era of late night comedians who didn’t devolve into partisan hackery to remain relevant. Will always be my favorite late night host ❤
Conan can be funny without a script.  A lot of late night talk show hosts need prepared bits, but Conan was funnier when things went off the rails (and often encouraged it).
I think that buffalo was spicier than anything on that table.
Master of Comedy. Conan will forever be my favorite!!
Lorde destroying the wings with grace and flavor notes was kinda eerie but cool and fascinating Gary Vee's bones-and-all ep was nuts and funny but he struggled getting there at times Conan's was an absolute dismantling, knocked Sean into hiccups and was a hilarious masterpiece ep that will need rewatching BRAVO!
He's telling the truth 99% of people on here dont really try these wings at their true potential 😅
Can we please make this man immortal? Please please please?
Greatest. Episode. EVER!!!!
Robin Williams would be proud. Conan is awesome!
An absolute superstar of a man. Best guest ever
Conan rules. What an entertainer.
Conan proved that he is not human... though he has tried to convey that openly thorough his career how inhuman he is, what lizard man he is from outer space, we just thought he was just a great comedy guy, but he gave up and just gave into the character. These Earthling peppers are not doing anything to him.
Get back to one table you dopes. The intimacy is LOST!
I'm gonna need this to reach 10mil
I was too young when conan was in his prime, i always preferred slap stick stuff.   But as I got older I really appreciate conan
Conan 🐐
GOAT! 🐐👏🏻
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conan just seems like a solid bloke, and Sean is cool for sitting back and letting him take control
Red heads have a higher tolerance for pain.  He already has a leg up.
Insanity at its best.  The only other person who could've possibly topped it was Robin Williams.  Such a treat to witness the madness in action!  Bravo!
I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE AMAZING
I didn’t know what to expect coming into this one. I literally clapped sitting in my Uber.
Conan didn`t just steal the show, he KIDNAPPED IT! THIS WAS AMAZING! 👏
This fella owns a dog house
Best one ever!!!!
I got a Bonan for Conan!
Conan is the GOAT..who would have thought he would crush "hot ones"..!?
What a way to end the season😂😂😂😂
One word - Legend
This is a masterpiece.
Conan is a f*ing legend!
Can we make the music louder? I can almost hear them talking.
At 26 minutes in he sounds like Rick’s mulan sauce rant 😂😂😂😂
I feel like he covered his tongue in wax like homer did to win the chilli eating competition
Is conan in a Willie Esco coat?
22 minutes in 😂
Check my pulse 😂 you have one 😂 thank you 😂😂😂😂
how it started: 😇😇 how it ended: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Waiting for him to keel over after the last one.
Amazing video... Probably the best I have ever seen... Great job😂😂😂 congratulations on all the team...
Was waiting for a Mac n Me drop
You, sir, earned my respect. Like, WOW!!! He played with the sauces...poured those like pancake syrup.
Can’t call myself a Conan fan but, he killed it
Hilarious
This reminds me of when Conan went to Wi Spa and Mr. Lee scoured his freckles off.  His reaction was very similar.
Conan needs to be our next Secretary of State
You can't stop me from being who I am!
Conan is one of the few celebrities I liked in my youth and didn't come to dislike when I grew older. Hope he will stay with us for more than another 4 years.
19:29 I once tweeted that Ryan Phillippe was my favorite mediocre actor. He blocked me.
The zoom in on da bomb leaking out onto the table sent me
This is the best way to close out this season
Conan really making MGK look like a chump inventing the last dab
The man is on the brink of death and doesn't flinch. What a beast.
A true legend
Best one yet 👏👏👏
I wish Conan was my dad❤😂
I wasn't sure if we'd get chill Conan or manic Conan, I never would have anticipated deranged Conan. Love him nonetheless.
Dude, ghost pepper to not famous dudes is amateur.  There is this show in Korea where they start with really fit people and have them do crazy stuff.  There should be a spice contest with normal people that can hack the heat.
23:00 is me logging into my first zoom call every Monday morning
I’m SOOOO happy that he’s coming back to late night! I have missed him dearly 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Conan is one of my heroes. I love this man.
I would absolutely love to see Craig Ferguson on your show! I think it would be amazing!
Hands down the best hot one's episode!
Conan being Conan, Loved it
Conan turned into the Lisan Al Gaib controlling the spice
I love Conan! This whole thing was completely unhinged!
Man, this interview hit different. Thank you. 🙏
Who is better than Conan?
He brought his own Dr. Nick Riviera!
whats real danger?
So, so much sauce
This guy just dominated tha bomb wow!
That "Ohh YEAH!" at the end threw me into yet another fit of laughter.
THE BEST!!!
My god, what an exhilarating episode. Had to stand up and clap for these geniuses.    Watching them together made me smile and cry at the same time.
What a MONSTER !
"You're not a Dr. are you?" "N-no.....I should be tho" 💀
Conan rules. Been watching him since 93. Also request for this show; vegan wings
I'm sorry but he just tries too hard a lot of the time. This wasn't funny at all.
Conan are a legend❤
I loved every minute of this episode, whic is my favorite! I really liked even the small bits like......  -1:38. -7:38 -22:59
OMFG!  Loved this show forever but this episode had me rolling from start to finish. 😅😂
Probably going to go down in comedy history and highest rated on this channel
Conan is the best.
So much props.  I love this one sooooo much. He’s right, yanno Sean 🥰
Well there you have it, a real pro in action!! Just bow down and be grateful they didn't invite Colbert or Fallon!!
7 to now Conan I've thought Conan was the best late night/personality on TV. Him going into this show made it gold, and it's so him
This is why Conan is great and will go down as a talk show and comedy legend.
BEST EPISODE TO DATE.   P.S I BEEN HERE SINCE SEASON 1
Doctor, please check my pulse. Proceeds to do a choke. Haha freaking gold.
Check for a pulse... Yeah it's there.
CONAANNNN!!!!!!😂❤
Conan is a national treasure.
The utter madness of Conan O’Brien I love you so much 😂
Quinta did it better 🤷🏽‍♀️
I have seen Conan since 1990 and im not surprised 😂 cooooooonan! What a man ❤
Thank you for reminding me how awesome Conan is. Stayed up late to watch him as a young man
Conan is literally the weak looking character that is secretly OP in an anime, but has achieved grandpa status so he gets even stronger as per custom to anime stereotypes
I've never loudly and obscenely cry-laughed at any Hot Ones episode so much as this one. BEST ep hands down.
Conan is so hilarious it's ridiculous, he hasn't lost it at all.
pls get craig ferguson
I love that conan gives it his all in everything he does. A true legend.
Wow, he is even better with heat than David Blaine was!
Funniest interview yet
Hands-down, one of the best episodes ever!
That was legendary!!!!!
What an incredible masterclass of comedy, ladies and gentlemen!
I miss Conan's late night shows
This is the most hilarious Hot Ones interview I’ve ever watched. Congrats on keeping yourself together Sean.
One of the best episodes I’ve seen!!
I've actually never cared for Conan that much. This is far and away my favorite episode of Hot Ones ever.  He is me. That is exactly what I would do if I were on. And I'm a schmuck.
I don’t believe that man’s ever been to medical school…
Did Conan eat a candle before this interview?
Masterful performance, Conan.
Im watching the new Conan show
Probably the best episode ever.
Conan goes HARD!
wing drop
Beat one ever!
I love that man!
I have to pick up a book, thanks Conan!
Conan walked in telling himself he was going to dominate these wings and give a legendary performance. Stuck to it !  Epic show.
My face hurts from laughing for 25 minutes.
Insane! Superheroes are real.
It’s the red head tolerance for pain 😂
Impressive eating, but trying too hard to be funny.
Conan sure committed to that ending
In a sea of great episodes of Hot Ones this is easily the single best one to date.  Too funny.
Almost as good as the Ice Spice episode 💦👀👌🏾
Hot Ones has jumped the shark.
So conan O' brien just proved that the reactions were all actors acting for the shows ratings..... Thanks Conan for the truth my boy!!!
Wing Drop
There’s a new king now
Bless conan obrien. Guy has had me crying from laughter for decades. Best hot ones interview of all time! No one will ever beat this interview.
Hubris has never been funnier!
This is the first one of these where I felt my blood pressure spike just watching it.  My gosh, I hope he is okay.
Ireland is home of the spice bag after all
Conan the Goat 🐐 🙌!
First time I've witnessed Sean being a tad perplexed. Too funny all around.
I've loved Conan since I was 11 years old. He's the epitome of entertainment! F You Leno for getting in his way!
there is just no way the last sauce has 2.6mio scoville
The legend.
This whole episode was a fever dream
Why did I get emotional
Idk why I didn’t expect it, but Conan going harder than anyone makes me so happy 😂
Best appearance ever!  Conan is so funny!  😂
Best show ever!
Where is Andy
If Conan is in your show... Its not your show anymore... *"Its a Conan event"*
Probably the best thing I've watched on YouTube so far.
Goat episode! 😂
legend
I expected nothing less of Consie :D
Pls da bomb 😭😭😭😭😭
Hands down one of the best episodes! 🤣💯 Conan is so entertaining and intriguing it's fun to just watch him do his thing and be a free spirit... Definitely strive to be a free spirit in life because we only get one go around on earth
What an absolute treat!
This is absolutely unhinged. And absolutely outstanding. 😂
By far the best guest I’ve seen on here.
Epic!! Finally!
is conan related to trump?
Epic ending message by Conan.
Someone check on these two 😂
Why do Americans confuse the words cement and concrete?
how coked up is this guy?
ive watched pretty much every single one of these and this is by far the best episode of hot ones in my opinion!
Among the best of guests right there.
Bright red… “where’s the spice?!?”
Wing drop!!
I didn't take a look at the show for a long time. Could someone enlighten me why they made them sit this far from each other? I just find it weirdly disturbing, somehow it felt much more natural sitting at the same table like normal people would do. :)
Dear Lord!  It doesn't get better than this!
In the year 2000..... and 24 Conan will own Hot Ones and be top 3 guests of all time. 🍗
Why do I get the sense he's the closest guest we've had to Robin Williams on this show. That or having Iago the Aladdin Parrot on the show.
That was amazing.
This guy's got that joie de vive that i've always strived to conjure
That man is a chaos demon 😂
Wildest episode I’ve seen to date. Conan was an absolute monster!!
Love Conan!
Gold medal on this episode.  Sean was gobsmacked and seemed a bit unglued with the spices at the end.  I can't even imagine how either/both of them were feeling hours after the wrap or the following day.  I'm sure Conan was wrecked.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hahaha the ending was so intense and discusting, favourite episode so far
I didn't expect this pale being to dominate the whole hot sauce show 😂 I love him
THE best hot wings episode, it's not even close. Pure comic genius.  CONAN IS NOW THE KING. Good on ya Sean.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That is actually so amazing and impressive
Greatest hot ones ever!  Loved it. Thank you Conan O’Brien for making my late night childhood awesome! And who knew you were such a GangstA! 😂
How is he more intense than Eric Andre?
He’s such a sunshine orange fox 😍
FUNNIEST MAN ON THE PLANET
This was a great interview 👏 hes really the greatest
Hilarious. Definitely a legend in this show
Look at his eyes. 😂😂😂
the GOAT
hahaha Conan turned into Lewis Black there at the end.
😂😂😂😂
Conan is just legendary there is no other way to tell it. This episode will come to history as he destroy all the wings.
lol!!!
Conan is the 🐐
F'ing E - P - I - C ! !  I still prefer an actual interview and this isn't using Sean at his best, but I do love that Conan first gave him the respect and love before he took over. It was highly entertaining - like wrestling. Wow!
This is the best episode. thank god this the season finale or no one could have topped this
…and I thought shaye leboufe however you spell his name was a beast on hot ones….Conan owns this show now!!!
Like Dexter Morgan, Conan is removing his DNA from the scene by pocketing the wings. 😎
the ANIMATIONS! DRAWINGS! so cute! great job First we Feast Team!
I'm going to watch this everyday for a week. 3/7 so far. See you tomorrow. "I don't fear your wings man. Bring what you got, ok"
Something truly gross about seeing him covered in sauce like that
Conan and Bryan Cranston could play brothers
after this episode conan was rushed to hospital after having a heart attack and  brain hemorrhage at the same time
Please let this man live forever
why is no one talking about Jose being there 😭😭 its so funny, I love Team Coco so much, they're so extra with making sure there's comedy chops and its not even their show 😂😂😂
Greatest episode ever for me. I love Conan❤️
Didn't Bill Burr wear that same jacket? 😅😂
Best one by far 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who can follow up with this interview? Jesus? Ghandi? Warren G Harding? Ronald Reagan probably, but that’s it.
Max, Max it's like someone's name ? Yeah ..Max Weinberg !
Conan is more animal than man at this point - best episode ever!
he is the goat,
Oh my god
incredible
What an absolute madlad.
Conan might possibly be the coolest dude on the planet.....
Bravo! That. Was. Wild!
Sean Evans gets absolutely overpowered in this. He is utterly at sea.
Conan is a mad man!!! put every past interviewee to shame!!  the ultimate entertainer
Absolutely amazing
You know the tables have truly turned when Sean gets the spicy hiccups!
Conan deserves a Oscar for this, and many others, performances. The GOAT, definately.
Conan you're great!!!
This is the best episode!!
What a legend
yeah conan is just great, maybe the greatest! 10/10
Greatest last dab EVER. Full stop.
There can only be one Conan O’Brien, what a comedy legend. Best episode of Hot Ones!!
JFC, the fact that Sean does this for living and even he looks like he's in a bad place by the end, and Conan is just drinking from the bottle....like, that's acting, fooling even yourself that the narrative your portraying is true. I hope Conan survived this. Absolute legend.
Did Conan survive this? I'm too scared to watch the end.
Now get Sean to the podcast!!!
Best....episode....ever
😮
Something about a white guy screaming at the top of his lungs with a glass of milk on his hands gives me really a weird germany 45's vibe.
Wonder how things went for him later … I mean at the exit point
This is… wow, the most crazy guest that the show has ever done. Conan is amazing.
Wow! The best episode ever!
Conan is still the king!
I'm still sitting here in total disbelief. Personally, I always thought that Coolio was the boldest ever on the show (Steve-O being some exception), but Conan just went ahead with nothing to lose. Maybe he'd say, he went ahead to provide a good show, because that's what the people want to see. Cletus Christ, Conan... you didn't have to go that far, but I'd have to admit it was a very good show. Get well soon.
This has to be the best episode yet.
this is the best episode of hot ones. period.
Not surprised this taters-chomping jester absolutely nailed the challenge. What a champ
Probably the best episode
Conan has set the bar higher
What an absolute mad man 😮😂
Superb! Two of the most entertaining worlds of show biz colliding. Conan is a champion of goofery and this show brings out the instability in everyone. 😂😂😂😂🎉🏆🥇
When they said it's the season finale, I instantly thought about all the other seasons and how no one proceeded to pour more hot sauces on their wings.  I didn't get to see this entire video at first, about 4 days ago. Now I sat down to eat my dinner and lo and behold, Conan just starts opening the bottles and fully commits by pouring and drinking copious amounts of sauce.  The coincidence is astounding. Such a great end for this season. Not a fan of talk shows, but Conan earned some massive respect with this one.
Beat episode ever
There is a reason why Conan is the BEST.
Conan and Bill Nighy actually look a lot like each other. I just needed to see him slowly lose his mind to notice it
Wh-what did I just watch? LOL
This was hands down the best Hot Ones of all time. Paul Rudd in a far 2nd
Camera guy Bill didn’t show Blacks, he’s fired.
That’s craziest interview ever. Conan, you’re a legend.
This might be one of the greatest things I've ever seen. Conan, you are a comedy legend. Robin would be proud.
I was at a Leno show with Dustin Hoffman as the guest. He would lean in and then stop talking turn around and talk to people off stage.  Dustin Hoffman just sat there and then looked at the audience  and we all waived at him.  I was like, "LENO-Who do you think you are? That's Dustin Hoffman!"
Legend!
Conan is absolutely the best 🤣
Best episode ever, fr.
I love Conan! Great last guest!
Sean FUMBLED !! All that wing for wing dropped the ball didn’t show wing for wing and for the season finally !! Bummed on the match the guest! Never went against the grain but damm I needed the wing for wing energy Sean!!
What a man
Looking at this man with hot sauce, chicken pieces and milk smudge all over his mouth, and listening to his perspective on comedy, I just never feel so humored and inspired at the same time.
Yeah, Conan isn't funny at all. He's the antithesis if funny, actually.
How unhinged 😂😂😂😂😂 omfg I love it!
National Treasure!
One of the best guests!!
Yep. This is defintiely gonna be one of the classics up there with shaq and gordan
Best episode yet. Conan is a legend. "Why can't I feel?!" 😅 22:25  I'm in tears you guys. That last 5 mins though... I haven't laughed that hard in a while. Thank you.
Conan absolutely killed it. Phenomenal episode. 🤣
this will go down as the most memorable episodes of hot ones in its history.
The last 5-10 minutes, makes me think that's how Gene Wilder would've been the entire episode had this been around during his Wonka days!
Conan is great. I hope his new show is successful.
This was thee most insane ep
Funniest one yet
That was one of the funniest clips I've ever seen in my life.
Best ever, Conan.
Conan is hilarious! 🤣
I avoid this channel like the plague… sorry. I don’t like things that are popular and fun… but I love Conan!!!
My God, I love Conan! Dude hasn't skipped a beat. What an absolute legend.
THE BEST!!!!!
Conan O'Brien - Legend
Who's to say that all the unopened bottles were just prop bottles?
Let's give it up for Dr. Royale for improving those punchlines like a G!
bonkers :-D
Wouldn't  want to be him when part 2 happens.
The horror in Sean’s eyes is hilarious
Lol in the end there was no question just hovering the wings 🤣
If I hadn't seen the Conan afterwards explaining how he made a huge mistake, I would have been afraid he was going to die from inhaling that much hot sauce. Great interview, mad mess. Loved it!
We need the behind the scenes footage of conan after this LEGENDARY interview. ASAP!!!
Bow down to the king
Every single time I see Conan do any kind of appearance, I'm once again baffled by how anyone could ever look at him and say "nah, we don't want a show with him." Fallon, Kimmel, Meyers, these networks should be KICKING AND BITING each other to get their hands on O'Brien.
Anyone with doubts. Da Bomb is a concentration based, putrid and instantly blisteringly hot sauce. Those with higher Scoville hit hard but different. The Pepper X hits hard as it builds. Conan was not happy. He couldn’t be. What a comedy legend to keep it going like that. Distracting himself probably helped. 😂
Legendary Conan 😂
Solidified why he is the GOAT.
honestly conan was top 5 guest for me man that was incredible
Best hot wings ever omfg. Happy Birthday and release day, Conan.
BEST EPISODE EVEEEER!!!
Thank you Conan for comedy magic. Taking us to the max.
He doesn’t acknowledge the heat, but his face is getting redder and redder!  A true professional!  And gracious, as he praises Sean!
Like David Blane, Conan found a way to take over the show.     😂🤣 4  12:39 p.m.
Best episode of all time hands down.
😂😂😂😂 miss you Conan! Late night hasnt been the same.
Best guest ever! Showing everybody hot to eat Monoloco MataSanos Hot Sauce!
Im making a NEW Category for Conan O'Brien ...   He is .. The B.O.A.T.  ..... <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3   " Best Of All Time "
Never clicked on an episode of Hot Ones so quickly.
Don't like Conan.  Never watched Conan.  TOTALLY new respect!!!  Nothing makes HOnes better than guests who are beasts.  Definitely worth watching.
This had to be the best episode wow
Very, very good!!!
FAVORITE GUEST EVER! Can't wait for the new show conan
Historic!🎉
Best episode.
Conan the GOAT 🤣😊
By god he's a true Irishman. What a savage 😂
My favorite late night guy. And one of the best entertainers out there! Great episode 👏
At 50 years old I have seen many great comedic movies,TV shows,stand up performances,and variety talk shows.This interview is the funniest thing I have seen in at least a few years.
This is just incredible!!!
Greatest Entertainer
Without a doubt my favorite episode. I’ve never enjoyed Conan as much as I did here.
This may be the funniest episode ever
Conan is not funny at all!!
Amazing
Bro this is terrifying
Conan is so unpredictable! At some point I thought he was going to rub his eyes with his fingers. He is insane and brilliant!! Some people may think he was on substance. But that's not true. He just does anything for the show.
Conan stated "You're going to give them the best show they've ever seen. Thats show business." And he delivered through the interview. Hes a true showman and entertainer
Conan should do a "day after" themed podcast.
That was a great one!!!! Great guest and had Sean laughing the whole time!!!!😂😂
Finally! Too bad that when Conan came to Argentina only visited channels who represented the mafia in the government. There was some really bad advisor work right there. Still, Conan is great and didn't make it about the politics.
There has been legends on this show but now we have a GOD!!!  That was the best show!
Not even done watching….this is the GOAT guest!!!!! ☘️
This has joined my list of favorite episodes ever, Conan is a legend 😂🤣
Conan……. Legendary. 👌🏾😂
How is this possible 😮
Man is SIPPING that sauce!
Conan is a treasure, he owns television, and now youtube. He has been relevant since 1993 onscreen, and even earlier offscreen..
Some people are built different
Best episode ever, i really laughed out loud! XD
This was incredible
Best one yet, hands down. Conan is a legend and he really took that to the level I expected of him. Amazing.
My jaw has never dropped watching this show until today. WOW, what a legend :')
I cant stop laughing bring him back encore
Could we get Conan and DJ Khalid  on the same episode? Lololol
Usually Sean mimics the guests eating process and order ..... didn't quite see that, this time 😂
Best one yet… ❤
Conan is a G
16:52 the absolute mad man
Conan remains undefeated
Why does this vid got a yellow back light in the intro?? Like how!? Never saw that
Conan is a natural comedy genius.
"the other guy"  doesnt even want to say leno's name because of their beef haha
I…I think this is the best episode ever
I…I think this is the best episode ever
"A Charlie Rose show eating hot wings." 110% brilliant!
imagine dude, sitting there as Sean Evans an hour before this video: "my god, i'm going to interview THE Conan O'Brien." and then you get this absolute insanity.
Best. Episode. Ever,
Amazing
The Greatest guest AND Talk Show Host😂🎉❤
Gosh I love Conan! Wish he could  continue his show till i grew old
Absolutely incredible . Conan is him.
Conan is the best.
Best guest ever!
He's such a g.
this is one of the best channels on YouTube, and this is one of their best episodes right away - YouTube GOLD!
Legend.
Ive barely gotten into this video, but Conan had me from time he brought on the doctor who couldn't even say where he went to school,  then said I'm not scared of your wings...I'm assuming this gonna be funny
That was EPIC! Wow. I was terrified he was going to rub his eyes though....
you know when you watch something and you just know its going to be counted as one of the most legendary moments of our current pop culture? The last time I felt that was when I watched the Hots Ones with Paul Rudd, this episode is the same. and it makes sense since the Conan O'brien episodes with Paul Rudd were always the best ones😂♥
Conan is a savage 🤣
Conan the Legend
I think Conan was probably the best one so far 🤣🤣 absolutely demolished 🤣🤣🤣
Conan is the most goated. We always known it and he’s proven it once again 🙌🏼
Conan is my favorite comedian dude! This guy is completely unhinged
Conan and Stone Cold are the two who owned this
Gross.
Best episode yet! Conan and Sean together, are pure gold!
I just love Conan so much ❤
We need a follow up episode to see if Coco is still alive
Conan just killed the show. Goodbye @FirstWeFeast !!! 🌶️🚀
This was pleasant, was shocked to see Conan keep a calm and sane composure throughout the whole thing
Wow...Conan is really intense. Kept me on the edge of my seat yelling Noooooooooo!!!!!! Don't drink that!!!!!🤣🤣
"You're not a doctor are you?" "I should be."
Dedication to the hot wings aside, this episode made me REALLY appreciate Conan's comedic mind to a level I never had before.  What a treasure, he is!
Bravo!!
Truly peak comedy
So we gonna see a string dance at some point?
This guy’s the best comedian seriously
This was THE best show ever!!! Conan is hilarious! This episode beat all the other Hot Ones.
This has got to be the best episode in the shows history. I was dying laughing 😂
You have to know he regretted that Da Bomb pour and lick. I wouldn’t be surprised if his mouth wasn’t just numb for the next two. 😂
wow....conan just keeps winning:D what a guy
Wow ... indisputably the baddest, craziest badass EVER on Hot Ones!
Conan sacrificing his health for us
My God...🤣
One of the best episodes ever. Amazing how Conan was dying at the end, but the level of cockiness never abated.
That’s the most New York thing I’ve heard… “where’d you go to school?” “out of state.” Hahahah I’m dying
He's irritating and not funny
He is so husband material
"Are we doing this!!"
I loved the segments in Conan's shows when he went to foreign countries, the Cuba and Japan episodes comes to mind. So really looking forward to this new show now. I missed watching Conan he has so much physicality to his comedy that just isn't captured in the podcast.
OMFG!
That’s an outrageous hairstyle
It sounded like he was handling it great until I looked at the video and he looked like he was dying hahaha
THE BEST episode till date, Conan had us expecting he will quit midway like Gervais as he said he's not familiar with spicy and then we got this episode 😂😂😂
Conan's a helluva drug! 😂
Why are they still social distancing like wankers
Best episode ever
THE BEST HOT WINGS EVER Seriously  He's awesome
I think this dethrones Paul Rudd and Gordon Ramsey for my favorite hot ones episode of all time. Conan is the absolute goat
What a gross sponsor this episode. Travel to Texas? To do what? Die of an ectopic pregnancy? Get deported despite being a citizen (yes, they've done this)?  No tf thanks.
😂
Please have him every season going forward
LOL for the first time in while. COCO rules.
Best episode ever. You might as well shut it down now!
GOAT CONAN O BRIAN.......❤❤❤❤❤
Gordan Ramsey's episodes has some competition
Please tell me that waterbuffalo story footage is online.
Conan O'Brien, you are my hero sir.  You've earned your spot as king of late night.  Thank you very much.
"Show business is, you're getting the greatest show in the world."- Conan O'Brian
I've always loved Conan O'Brien! I think he's the best late night host of all time 🤷. He's hilarious and awesome.
he said it himself - "show business means you're getting the best show ever" - and he delivered 100%
cue in Johnny Cash with his Ring of Fire.
Warren Harding's train is located at Pioneer Park in Fairbanks Alaska....Today's random trivia.
My eyes are tearing up from laughter!! My favorite episode out of all of them! Freaking hilarious!! Rubbing the hot sauce on his nips, taking drinks from the bottles.... HA!
i wonder if they can do one with Craig Ferguson
That was LEGENDARY. For me it’s between this interview and Paul Rudd’s, but for entertainment value this takes the cake.
THE BEST EVER!!!!!!! ❤
This was, is, and will be the Pinnacle episode of Hot Ones.
LEGEND!
Best guest ever?
Conan thinks he's the funniest guy in the room at all times, but he's not. I'm still trying to figure out why NBC pushed Leno out to push Conan in to get half the ratings. I've never liked his comedy. Worst episode yet. Guy loves hearing his own voice.
Conan is hilarious
Bros he is going into some kind of shock LOL! Seriously! ballz of steel though got to hand it to him.
Possibly the best episode ever. Conan is like no other!
I love conan. Absolute living legend. He's up there with some of the golden age and silver age comedians of our time.
What an epic episode. Conan rules!
conan is a beast
The best!!!
Wow, Masterclass.
Yooooo I have not laughed out loud this much I think ever. Conan is wild man! 🤣🤣🤣
Standing Aplaus for this man 👏👏👏 gordon need see this and feel shame 😂
There needs to be a show with these 2 as hosts. They are the most hilarious comedians/hosts I’ve seen in a long time
The doctor answering with the year he graduated instead of where as his introduction is an incredible moment of comedy
Conan, king of red! KING OF RED!!! what an awesome episode
I have to believe there's way more content recorded than in the cut show.  I would love to see an extended outtakes or just random extra content that didn't make the show.  This was one of the best episodes.
holy f@$k. 🤣👍
14:50 I remember the day David Letterman brought Conan onto his show introducing him as a new talk show host.    I had no idea who he was.  Just some tall dude who seemed buttoned up and lackluster.   He turned out to be one of the best ever!     4/15/24, 11:39 a.m.
"Wise words from the wise and stable man..." I lost my mind laughing.
Dont forget that while Conan is brilliant and was sacrificing everything to entertain the audience, the editor of the video timed his jokes perfectly so they hit right. Editors never get enough love.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 This one can't be topped!
a gallon of pepto was awaiting off camera
Best show ever! Wow!!
18:32 hes red and crying hahahaha
This entire episode is iconic
oh man, buzzfeedmedia, yikes
I don’t have HBO max but I wanna watch his new show 😢 Missed seeing him on tv
Man, I think this is the best hot ones episode of all time. Instant classic.
For the first time I could actually feel the guest’s pain 😂
They need to change it to The Last Sip from Dab
That what happen when you max out charisma and fire resistance  😂
For the laugh Conan could take a bullet. Respect
He can't feel because his face is numb from the  nine lines he did before this show 😂
Conan O'Brien is my new HOT SAUCE hero!  Wow! & 🤣
Holy Moly, Conan is stone cold steel mouth.
Hands down the best TV host ever. Conan is comedy gold. Give this man 4 more shows 😂
Compare this episode to that terrible Ice Spice one...wow
I need him a second time! Part 2 please
Insane in the membrane..
only host to match Shawn’s coherence of words LOL
I legitimately had to look up if he was still alive after this episode 🤣🤣🤣
Absolute legend.
Conans eyes are so bloodshot, he def high af
oooooooooooooooohhhhh my GOD
What a machine.
*wing drop* Conan out
There have been a lot of great episodes... but this is easily the new high water mark.
Just top class 👍👍
Conan reminded me of Robin Williams.
❤
Dude....Conan is a badass! The way he was drinking the sauce....holy.....
Conan just made Hot Ones his show. This was amazing.
with the spice he became lisan al-gaib
I knew he would hide it well
"...pure pepper?, Why can't I feel?" What a beast
Greatest episode to date! Hands down!
Funniest guest ever. You did it again Conan
Interesting take I feel like Conan would make a great joker
All fake confirmed.
yep, wow. I didnt know hes this good!
I haven’t laughed like that in a while
Bro how is he simultaneously the biggest wreck of anyone to be on the show by the end, but also perfectly fine and in control the entire time!? Conan is the GOAT!!
I feel like "the wing drop" will be a thing moving forward on this show LOL
He’s probs on the same boldness level as Steve O
I never expected this interview but this is the best hot ones for me conan really shines in front of the camera.
This was just amazing. Love Conan
One of the best late night personalities in television 1. Johnny Carson 2. Conan O'brien 3. Craig Ferguson 4. David Letterman 5. Jon Stewart (early 2000s version)
Conan is the 1
I love that Conan complimented the host on his interview skills. That wasn’t an act. He sincerely meant that. Probably my favorite part of the whole video.
Best. Episode. Ever. 👏
Odd, I was holding up my hand to my phone screen, and it cut perfectly to conan looking bald without hair, and he really really looks a lot like Joe Biden 😂
Legendary!😂
Conan took  this guy to school
Muthafuckin Conan . LEGENDARY
Love Conan
I love it when Conan is talking he's calm but he can go crazy when he wants to.  LOL I sure do miss him on late night tv
Honestly, I can’t believe what I’ve just watched. This was incredible.
What a Legend !!! And they gave the Tonight Show to Jimmy Fallon , the most annoying  guy out there . Should have gone to the King 👑 Mr.Conan O’brien !!! Love that dude
I feel like, with this one video, we just walked into a new chapter.
Conan: call an ambulance, but not for me! xD
This is the best episode, IMO. Conan is s boss! Get Craig Ferguson or Jerry Seinfeld on the show, please.
Conan and Craig Ferguson are my all time favorite late night hosts hands down. Legends
Conan !! Stands a true barbarian atop spice mountain !!!  🤣🤣🤣
Conan is unreal, what a legend 👏
Can I keep these? 😂😂😂😂
This was a legendary interview 😂
amo tanto a este hombre y este show, es el final de temporada que no merecemos, jajajaja, love you Conan
I feel like Dr Arroyo stayed in a Holiday Inn Express last night. Really looking forward to his new show.
I mean if he wasn't regarded as a legend before, he certainly is now
I grew up in an Irish household and wasn't introduced to spice until my 50s... YA RIGHT 🤣
my wife and eye finished this episode laughing hysterically while wiping our tears.. conan did wonderful
Always forget how huge Conan is physically, Conan & Sean standing with each other looked kinda crazy 😂
Legend
he's the one
Best finale🎉🎉🎉
My fave used to be Ramsey. Conan is now my fave. This was great!
Never seen one drink from the f***ing spice bottle 😂😂 (On your Show😂)  Legend...(Not even one of the first ones...but 4 last one...crazy)
Sean. What happened to matching the guests hot sauce intake? I don’t see you swigging Sean!!!
I would have taken the leftover tray not the test wing.. 👂 🌎 💚
He has a show with HBO and also hates the name change😂
If look at the spectrum of how to handle this with grace - Conan is on the complete other end of Gal Gadot
this is the Top, we got Conan rubbing his Nips, we have hit the summit!
We have a new best episode.
Comedy Hero
Legen-  wait for it...
Funniest I have ever seen.
Best episode to date and by a long marging!
I didn't think it was possible for me to love Conan O'Brien anymore than I already did😂
I wonder if Johnny scoville would come on the show. What an interview that would be.
The Conan!!!! Hands down best Anchor in our history!!!  No one can compare look at him He’s clearly a beast!!
Conan O'Brien looks like he doesn't age
The wings in the pocket 🤣
😂😂😂😂
Best show ever hands down, to the top like a bullet! Love me some Conan
Referring to Jay Leno as the other guy is so awesome to me.
Oh my god...hot ones finally destroyed 😂😂 after like 15 years?
I think Conan suffered every bit as much as every other Hot One's participant... what he did was channel that pain into extreme hyperactivity.  A novel and effective approach and pretty much in line what I'd expect from Conan.  We're doing the challenge again this weekend and I'm going to give this technique a try... I don't really need it until you get to da Bomb... but that's when it gets seriously challenging (and you could tell when Conan shifted the insanity into high gear... when he gets really crazy with da bomb and immediately mentions that might have been a bad idea)
Favorite episode. I love Conan
Was not a Conan fan until today. I salute his commitment.
I bet you live 4 years tops 😂
Conan is an absolute beast.
off... everything has to be a bit with this guy...
Conan is the best episode I have ever seen, dude is hilarious
Name a better entertainer. Just one
Hands down, Conan is the greatest comedian ever!!
Warren Harding getting roasted by Conan on YouTube wasn't what I was expecting from 2024, if I'm honest.
Conan O’ Brien, you are a beast
conan the legend!
the man is sick 😅😅
I want to see Jordan Schlansky!
This is probably the most fun I had watching Hot Ones and Conan. He is the best
That is going to be painful coming out the other end.....
That was probably one of the greatest youtube videos I've watched Conan is a literal legend MY GOAT
Outstanding Talks how host. Jimmies, or colberts can be replaced easily, but there's only one Connan.
I was not prepared for how awesome this episode was. Brilliant
only Conan can insult the production company that paid him to make a show for them
Red heads can tolerate pain!!!!!
wow, what a badass!!!! :D Conan you've stole the show
Conan got that trump makeup on
Conan getting out of pocket right out the gate 😂
My hero
This kind of Chaotic energy is exactly what I need!!
Next up: Lets grab the other lord of late night. Late late Night.   The Man's man: Craig Ferguson!
23:00
Everyone regrets Da' Bomb. Everyone.
Conan is the GOAT of late night show's
Absolutely the best episode hands down!!!!
Savage
Absolute greatness. Conan is the best ever.😂
what a legend!
I'm not surprised he's been calm and collected throughout the whole video. Pretty professional, this guy Conan.
Well now we know where the red hair comes from!
I did not expect his Irish Genes to be able to handle this much hot sauce 😮😂
TOP😂😂😂
Conan is him
This could be the series finale and I would be completely satisfied.
Conan is hilarious. Always delivers laughs
The man is a god 😅
Conan's shtick really wears thin quickly. Oof.
I think this episode rivals Steve-O's one with the eye shot. Way to go Conan
Best episode I've seen!
Thank you for an awesome episode, but why are you still using the two table, Covid setup in 2024 (especially now that we know the 6ft rule was totally made-up BS)???
This is hands-down my favorite episode of all time. I could not keep it together for even ONE second 😂😂😂
Conan my boy !😅😅
Rofl, Conan is hilarious.
Love From Nepal 🇳🇵🇳🇵🔥❤❤
best guest hands down
"I said it and Gandhi said it...and Popeye"
"if you-ve laughed, you failed!" :D
amazing episode, you still need to get mattpat on from game theory
conan o'brien is a legend
Why can't I like this more than once!
E-P-I-C! No other words needed.
This is my new favorite episode
This has to be by far your funniest episode. Conan is a beast.
My abs are killing me from laughing so hard 😂😂😂😂. That has GOT to be the most epic episode EVER! Thanks, Sean….AND Conan!
I rarely laugh out loud watching youtube but this whole interview was insane 24:59
Crazy Cool.😂
Conan is such a legend. 🔥🔥🔥
The best
I like ot think Conan legitimately travels around with a posse of incapable professionals (doctor, lawyer, spiritual guide, etc.) in his daily life and they all advise him terribly at every turn hahaha
joker Conan its funny
The LEGEND of Conan grows.
is conor ok?
“Take ownership on your side of the table…”   OH. He owned the show for sure 😂
i thought he was faking, but in the end his eyes showed his power of will is strong.
Peak comedy would be following him to the bathroom stall with a microphone in a few hours.
There is never gonna be somebody like this in history. I think Conan is secretly the god of laughter, who invented fun itself 😂
Liza please take care of him. Good Lord have mercy on him after the show
Conan unchained. The greatest talk show host that ever lived, and perhaps the greatest man.
He's a legend in my book 💪💪💪😁😁😉😉👍
Going from the  Ice Spice interview to Conan is like going from needles in your eyes and ears to sweet angelical soothing goodness pure talent.
funniest talk show host of all time
The Goat!
I love you conan!!!!!!
First time I see anyone pour da bomb and lick the sauce💀
I dont understand why all you boomers think this guy is funny
my god what an absolute legend! this is Conan at his absolute best hahah
I could watch Dr Arroyo + Conan all day.
Now that is a man using pain and channeling it threw his comedy almost like he was feeling it with it words are words and they are wording quite right
I have been watching Conan for years. He never in any interview disappointed me or not met my expectations. I just love his energy and craziness😂
Funniest show by far, great skit with the doctor. Take a bow conan!
Best ever!😂😂😂😂😂
Conan invented the "wing drop" and I can't wait to do when the Buffalo Bills win the super bowl next season!
"This one im not gonna lie" had my dying!!
Best one ever.
Dude drank* hot sauce. When he added to Da Bomb I was like, uh oh.  The rub one was where I lost it.
I seen a lot of really good episodes of this show. This by far has got the best one! That. Was. Awesome!
Conan O'Brien makes Eric Andre look normal in thos interview.
THIS MAN IS A LEGEND!!!!
What a legend.
I freaking LOVE Conan
Fun fact Conan served in WWII
Just wait till he makes a restroom stop... 🤣🤣🤣🥵🥵🥵
How could one not love Conan 🔥🔥🔥
Dr Arroyo accepts payment in chicken bones
Mad magazine 😂😂
Definitely check out his podcast. Interviewing the fans is such a delight. Conan is a national treasure!
PAUSE 18:31
By far the best guest and episode to date!
4:03 tane impala mentioned
Wow... Thats all i have.
Thank you for the bucket list episode ❤
Hall of fame guest and episode.
I’ve waited years for this and it was better than I could’ve ever imagined. No one’s going to do it better than Conan.
Tremendous
Gold of an episode!
Mad probs to Conan, he's a being of sheer determination and force of will.
Hearts for Conan ❤❤❤
The most insane, off the hook interview yet.  Epic.
LIterally, cry laughing at the end. Conan is the GOAT
Conan understood the assignment. Epic. A+
How does he look exactly the same as he did when I was 16, and I'm 36 now....Ehhhh he might look a little bit older but its hard to tell.
What may not be obvious is how much Conan supported Sean and the show. He did all that with layered comedy to cleverly elevate the experience and let the show itself shine through. Brilliant comic and a good sport.
Never laughed so hard. Unreal.
good acting... he is dying inside but hides it
Id expect nothing less from this man!
BEST EPISODE EVER! I was waiting for the day Conan finally made this show and he did not disappoint. He was hilarious, extravagant, and man! I'm not sure if he likes spicy food, but he maned up and made it through fantastically. AWESOME!
Well I made it 4 minutes and 14 seconds and that included fast-forwarding through the first 3 and a half minutes
Did this man put a chicken wing in his pocket 😂
how did he do that though !
Killed it!! 😂
Man this was awesome dabbing The Bomb gosh😂😂😂 my favorite episode.
the sauce got to him,, weenee wanaahh weeneeee!~
21:05 Why wasn’t this the “Travel Texas Big and Bold Moment”? 🤠
That's the real Rick Sanchez.
We are all well aware that in America the cream doesn't rise to the top the s*** rises to the top hence every late night host since Johnny Carson and Jay Leno and Letterman retired
Conan O'Brien is an American treasure. Period.
Conan went flat out Feast Mode... incredible.
Legend
Legendary
Conan has been doing the dumber after the show thing his entire career. I'm not sure I have ever laughed at anything Conan O'Brien has ever done
Did Conan have covid and lose his taste buds. Absolutely amazing.
Best episode, howling the entire time😂
he is amazing
Conan looks good for 75
This is probably going to be the most famous actor interview in existence
"These aren't rantings of a man that just ingested some bad chemicals!"
The only way this could have been better would’ve been If he would have projectile vomited at the end. 😂Conan rules
He is an absolute madman.
The only likable talk show host❤
Best. Episode. Ever.
Conan is the best
I was so unprepared for how completely insane this went.....
Now this is a professional! You don’t just get “oh my publicist said I should do this so here I am”. Conan shows up with a plan, and an actor, with props. Then he doesn’t do the “brag about it then break down on wing 7”. No! He’s chugging pepper X and only falls semi-apart after the whole thing!
Conan is a freaking national treasure.
respect
You clearly Save the best guest for the finale😂🤣😂🤣😅😅😅 God I love he`s commitment to making a good show. Forever a comedy Legend mr Conan O'Brien
Top episode. Just kept getting better.
Yeah, Da Bomb is always the great equalizer. It's undefeated.
Conan went HAM! Legendary!
LEGENDARY
Burn stomach and face off for a few days on your birthday. Not the worst. Rememberable that's for sure
Best one yet
He just couldn't let himself be outdone by another talk show host.
PLEASE get Louis Tomlinson on your show!!!
Everyone should hate Conan by now but everyone should also hate everyone who thinks Conan is funny.
Conan is one of a kind 🤣🤣🤣 i love this man!!!
The moment he put that first wing in his pocket, I knew we wer going to see some classic Conan 😂🤣
Conan is the best 😂😂😂😂
Goat episode
I bet the water buffalo that threw Conan was the progeny of the water buffalo that threw Jack Black on the set of Tropic Thunder.
Wow. I don’t normally gaf about Conan, but this is easily top 3 episodes, he knew the assignment 👏🏻👏🏻
Conan GREATEST OF ALL TIME
Thank you. Conan is the king !
New respect for Conan!
Love it
conan off script isnt funny whats he tryna do with chicken in pocket? comedy ha
The best episode ever. It is not even close.
If I didn’t already know about Hot Ones, I’d assume this was just a classic Conan sketch. Dude is a fine wine of comedy.
Its taken me 20 something years to think Conan was funny, he is pretty funny now.
What an absolute lunatic. I love him
I need a BTS with Sona losing her mind.
" The other guy" part was definetly about Jay Leno :D
Conan is crazy and the best!😭🤣
Conan is amazing
Probably the best episode ever in this show
DAYM CONAN TOOK THAT LIKE A BOSS! AWESOME MAN!
Bringing along characters. It's like watching an old episode of Late Night. Conan O'Brien is a national treasure.
This is the funniest episode I have see yet.
i can't get over his hair.....     i don't think much CAN get over his hair.   if you don't get it. most airliners need to divert their path when he goes outside.
27 minutes of the best comedy on the whole of YouTube or anywhere. I was crying for most of the second half.
Big Fan of Conan 💯💯💯
"Can I keep these?" killed me...
One word: LEGENDARY.
23:00 - 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan was channelling pure Chris Farley with this one.
This episode is one of the best ones.
The older Conan gets, the more he looks like a woman
This is typical obnoxious American behavior.  It’s no longer "be the best at something" but "be the weirdest" … and you’ll make a lot of money getting the sheep to watch your content.  What have we become? 🤦🏼‍♀️
"Why can't I feel????"
THE INSANITY!!! 😂
So good
The goat
Two and a half minutes in and I needed to pause and take deep breaths...  "Can I keep these?"  WHAT?! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best host ever, and it's not even close.  Conan is a masterful performer.  We may have just jumped the shark.
im predicting that no one will ever top conan in views here in hot ones lol
I don't care what vid conan is in. I see him; I hit "like"! ❤
Wow
Best show Ever 😎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this is sooooo funny
Best. Interview. Ever 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
best of the best man!
I did not thought I would say thins at the beginning of the video, but Conan is a legend!
I thought gingers have problems with spicy food
Conan proving why he's the king
Outstanding.
BEST EPISODE EVER
My wife persists in saying this was faked. I insist Conan actually did it with real sauces and OWNED them.
Did he just drink hot sauce to swallow the chicken? 😅😅
Might as well pack up. This will never be topped.
best guest ever..! 🌶️
Absolute legend!
“Out of state” -Doctor Arroyo 😂😂😂
He might still be in the hospital, calling for Dr. Aroyo.
This is the best episode you made by far. Conan is a treasure, he controlled the scene from the very beginning.
Worst part was finding out his new show only has 4 episodes :(
This was entertaining
Washing his hands with the sauce and then rubbing his chest 😂😂 legend!!!
That was something else 😂 There's nobody in the world like Conan 🧡
this is actually legendary. Experts from various fields should convey their learnings at the end of the last dab!!!! I love it!!!!
People i hope to see on hot ones next season:  Keanu reeves Halle barry Andy samberg Bill hader Sarah silverman The black keys as a duo Denzel washington Dude that use to do rivermonsters Al madrigal Jon stewart Anne hathway Jessica chastain Robert downey jr Jackie chan Brad pitt Samuel l jackson Run the jewels as a duo
Wow. What an episode. That was impressive.
Conan looks like the ''new face'' Madonna, or Madonna's new face looks like Conan
watched this 4 times already. love conans comedy, especially his remotes and travels. this episode is top 2 and not 2.
Best episode ever lol 😂😮😅
conan is just the best
This is the greatest ever!
funniest episode ever!
That Popeye quote 😂
9:05 Nothing new there, Conan. Showbiz is indeed about lying and deceiving.
What an effing awesome rockstar, he definitely trained eating spicy wings before he got on the show, that's how devoted he is to go beyond our expectations.
I would dare to argue Conan is one of the funniest people on the planet
Was afraid his face was starting to melt...
Ya gotta love Conan!
Conan is the GOAT
The redest guest you have ever had.
Maybe it's just that I'm a bit of a Conan stan, but this has to be the funniest hot ones ever
Wow ! Conan absolutely killed it. And almost got killed in return. All for us. Respect ! 🙏🏼🤣
I think all that spice went straight to Conan's brain
Greatest episode to date
Jerma-coded
Ultimate Season Finale!  So good!
🫵🏻🙌👏BEST ONE EVER-no one will top Conan EVER🫢🤣🤘🖖✌️👌👍🥇
Jesus that was hilarious 😂😂 Conan is a wild mf
The GOAT
This has been the best episode of this entire series.
I love how he looks like he's dying, but he is still able to go full tilt the whole way. Conan's a master entertainer through and through.
The king.
Easily my favorite episode of several fantastic episodes.  Conan owned this entire presentation.
As a dutch-man  i can honestly say that Conan is my fav american.
Conan always been an insane comedy talent, but i never expected him to go this hard, that legend will never be forgotten.
I’m dying 😂😂😂
This episode pairs extremely well with his appearance on Murderville.
dead eye stare while making jokes😮‍💨 scary
Conan should of been the lead in Late Night With The Devil
Easily the finest episode of Hot Ones of all time. The GOAT episode 👌
"Charlie Rose with hot wings." 👍👍👍
Effin legend.  Didn't even break character when you know he was suffering from Da Bomb.
16:50  yikes this is about to get crazy
Did Conan drink the wax from a candle before the show.
This is officially the best episode 😂
Show really hit a LOW having Gwyneth Paltrow on. Finally hitting that high, again.
Conan is the best.
Yes he drank the hot sauce but  I bet he can't watch the show himself cuz his acting was  embarrassing
Conan you’re amazing!
22:53 this is the first time I have seen Sean look really worried xD
He has to have that disorder where you can’t taste spicy stuff. Jesus.
This. Is. The. Best. Guest. Yet.
YES!
😂😂😂😂
This is everything I hoped it would be
god this is just the complete opposite of Gordon Ramsay's attempt
This is a perfect representation of why Conan is so beloved ❤️
I really needed that laugh, it was the best
Sean looked genuinely afraid
God I love Conan
Best of the season.
One of my favorite people in the world. Conan is a genius! A silly, ridiculous genius. In one show he dispelled the stigma that gingers have no soul.
Conan just broke your toy. He's the best. No one will ever be able to top this episode. You struck gold!
Conan is so awesome.
the one showman who control the show love him more TEAM COCO
It's a good thing Conan brought a doctor with him or I'd think he died shortly after this.
Conan is hilarious
ha ha ha ha......... best guest ever
Conan: "The greatest danger to my life is myself!"
Conan wants the Futurama Nixon on his shown it seems
This man has given me innumerable laughs for three decades. God I love him.
The questions, compliments, and content is amazing here
Wonder if he coated his mouth with something?
Conan went here with the objective of making people laugh and gaining new young audience, as he said himself at the end.  I think he did it.
This... is the best. Conan still slaying.
Conan was the best man, just the best. And he's just fine, he's: *"Perfectly F#@!^% Fine!!!"* 23:00
I think this is the best episode to date. What a genuinely good guy, Conan is.
“WHY CANT I FEEL!?” 💀
That Dr. Arroyo was Conan's emmy-award winning writer..
Conan is a beast! awesome!!
Conan is always great, where other tonight show hosts lose steam over time and or always stick to the script conan manages to go above and beyond every time
😂😂😂😂 best interview
I think Conan understood the original idea but went beyond it anyway.
the most unhinged episode I have ever seen.
Why didn't he do this in Haiti the place he says is so beautiful?
Conan was absolutely disturbing. I think I loved it.
Conan just keeps getting more hilarious
The 👑
Conan sticks to original comedy where others go for cheap political comedy.
Invite Zac Amico, please.
Legendary episode
Dr. Arroyo! - "Its not good".
Conan the Legend💯💯💯💯💯
Whoever played the doctor played his role perfectly
Maybe the best episode of all time great way to go out Conan wow 😂
easily the best episode so far !!
If you can survive water buffalo, I guess you can survive anything...
What a beast conan is
He the second goat other then David blame
COCO is a perfect candidate for attempting 'First We Feast' in reverse. Hot to mild! Imagine the questions asked, the answers and the reactions! Would it be a glass of milk at the end or coma? :)
Yeah this guy is a beast. And to be honest the host has like autism or something.
🤣
oh my god. teary eyes and red lips. Conan is truly a showman. one of a kind indeed! I hope his stomach is fine after all this spiciness.
Now that is a showman!!👏🙌👏
Watched it twice!
this was the most i’ve laughed at a first we feast episode. Conan is absolutely a pure comedic genius. 😂
Ladies and gentlemen…I give you the absolute GOAT! None shall ever come close to his greatness! KING COCO!
Conan is AWESOME! Love him!💜👍😂
It doesn't get better than this!
RIP Conan
I only watch eps with those that i don't know much about but i know who they are so i'm interested enough to hear Sean's q's and 🔥reactions, and there are people like Conan "in this ep as barbarian...🤣" O'Brien who i like..., this was to me the greatest ep ever 🤣👏🏻🔥🤘🏻🖖🏻✌🏻
Conan... You. Are. Insane.
Conan pouring hot sauce all over the wings/himself is giving me anxiety. Sean looks absolutely frightened.
i love everything about this  season ender! :)
He figured if I'm gonna be miserable and a drooling sweating mess might as well do it all the way and go full toddler 😆
Dude, Conan is soooo funny. I've listened to all his podcasts.  I wish I was more into him when I was younger. This guy is a effing amazing.
If theres anything conan has taught me in life its to never trust a railway salesman
Already knew this episode was gonna be a gem because Conan is legendary.. I love the times when a guest gives sean his FLOWERS AND In all honesty if I was a studio exec I would totally revive late night and have sean be the host albeit the writing and crew need to be on there game.
THE GOAT!
The only reason I'd ever want to be famous would be to get invited onto this show. Even if it WAS too much, you'd never know, and it's not some "I'm so macho I LAUGH at what you consider, painful!", it's just that ANY extreme sensation makes me laugh. I laugh when I'm happy, excited, nervous, scared, upset, in pain.. it caused quite a lot of arguments when I was a kid.
Conan as always going in full send
If I could like something a thousand times.  This might have been the best thing I’ve ever seen on YouTube.
BEST GUEST EVER
Conan is the goat
Legendary.. Drinking hot sauce straight off the bottle..  Conan is a tour-de-force
Gotta love Conan. He’s Brilliant I remember now why I’ve always held him in high regard.
What’s with his face? Did he do all the plastic surgery?
This is thr ultimate hot ones
I think this was the best hot ones episode of all time
I love conannn!!!
Hey Conan, is Haiti still great?
Absolute unit 😎
Easily the best guest on the show, the commitment to making it a success is incredible.
Possibly the greatest guest of all time?
Best guest ever!
Best one ever so far 😂
This was insane 😂😂😂😂😂😂
He’s not a good doctor, he’s an affordable doctor
My man went to the hilt
Absolutely epic!!!
That was a hard watch
Conan went all in ... and he gave a wonderful last speech about comedy inspiration ...
This is the opposite of the dj Khaled episode
Legendary!
And that ladies and gents, is why Conan was the greatest to ever do it.  Dude needs to host a talk show again.
man had enough spice to ride the shai hulud, respect
here is a man who knows what a show is
All Sean could do was chuckle and hang on for the ride. And what a hilarious deranged ride it was. Conan is my hero.
jesus christ. that was terrifying.
😢why was there no mat pat interview
Best episode ever.
Arguably the best hot ones to date
Conan is the GOAT
This was amazing! Shame the same can't be said for most of Hot Ones since it became an obligatory PR roadstop but oh well, that's just Hollywood, baby!
That got such a big laugh out of me!!! at 23:00 😂"I'm fine"
This may be the best episode yet!
I LOVE CONAN!!
Absolutely iconic Conan!!! IMO....the best Hot Ones ever!!! Amazingly wonderful episode Sean!!
Conan is like Jim Carrey in the way the take control of the attention and makes it their own in such a memorable way. Favorite comedian and favorite show host 🥇
Just give him the show
Pure class entertainer….. Salute to you, Mr. Conan.👏
I was here to laugh, but I got a Comedy Masterclass instead. Only Conan!
I've watched conan here and there but now i am a man obsessed. everything from his 90s skits to 2010s work office videos to the podcast (and monorail!) are all fantastic
He is the most unfunny comedian I have ever seen
He keeps his wings because he doesn't want anyone to clone him. Conan doesn't want cloning.
This is unbelievably good. It's up there with Ricky Gervais golden globes performance. What a boss
Best episode! Conan is the G.O.A.T.!!!!!
Conan needs to be back on major broadcast television
oh my god what is happeniiiiing, i love conan so much
Pretty sure Dr. arroyo is gustav the snobby Euro guest from way back lol
I absolutely needed this! I was getting so depressed reading the news. Everyone needs some comedy in their lives to get through the daily grind. Thank you Sean and Coco!
Conan channeling Frylock really is something.
I like the one time he put the wing in his pocket.  Also, I hope the Pope is watching, because I think Conan just nonchalantly turned water into milk...
Conan is the best guest ever
One thing I love about Conan: dude is ALWAYS on. Hilarious
I would definitely guess he's in his late 40s or 50s but not 60.
"You're just choking me!" -  - "So sorry!" "Nono, just feel for the pulse!" - "Alright..... It's there."
Guys please invite the the @stoltmanbrothers on for the next series 💪🏼
Conan still ROCKS!!!!
THATS HOW IT DONE MFRS
I've never laughed so hard in so so long 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂   Conan the wing barbarian   Like watching Tyson in his prime  All hail Conan, this channel will never ever ever beat that 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
conan ‘s the chill in chili
he beats the game
It's acid
But does it taste like Haitian BBQ?
Craig Ferguson next!
Jesus, he took on Da Bomb and won!
"Charlie Rose Show with hot wings"
conan - looked at all that came before and crushed them; crushed their efforts and won
My favourite episode yet. Conan the Destroyer
The bar was just set. Anything after will never reach the heights..
Best hot wings ever Conan is hysterical
This masterpiece is the opposite of the dumpster fire of an episode that is DJ Khaled's episode.
Realizing that Conan O'Brien is actually the Joker is one of the most amazing Revelations of all time.
Best interview I’ve seen on hot ones hands down! Drinking the hot sauces was a cap for me! 💪🏼👍🏼🫡
That might have been the hardest I’ve laughed in a really long time
Conan is the true GOAT, no one comes close to his personality & quick wit. Watched the whole interview not one second was not entertaining, glued to the screen
The only late-night guy who's not some dodgy political shill. Conan's great!
That was incredible!!!!
Conan should’ve gotten The Tonight Show. I don’t know who decided to give it to Jimmy, but that person needs to be fired.
Attention! Not spicy ≠ tasteless.
Is this considered as a public meltdown?
That was almost 30 minutes? Felt like 5. Conan's a gem.
I'm sorry... this man needs no introduction.
One of the best guests ever easily
I should have known Conan would come guns blazing.  I was concerned for the guy’s safety though the way he went at those wings.   Incredible.
Conan is seriously one of the funniest hosts & comedians unscripted, this guy is genius, on a dime he creates funny
Pure boss mode. That's why he's the GOAT
Conan is honestly one, if not, the best Gueston this show has
He who controls the spice, controls the universe
Apparently PepperX turns Conan into Lewis Black and im here for it
😊😊😊😊😊😊
Crushing it like Steve-O. Just lacks the hot sauce eye treatment 😂
absolutely incredible
Oh conan! I really really love you. Dont stop being you
The best host ever conan 🎉 glad u call him as a guest, nice hot ones ❤
8:11 as someone inspiring to be an MC, this is gold.  "The worst thing a host can do is tell the audience things aren't going well. It's an amateur move"
I love Conan. Glad he's back.
Conan is literally the last person on the planet I expected to go this wild with the sauces
Greatest guest ever!!!
❤😂😮this is by far my most favorite ❤️ to date! Much respect to COB! He brought it 🔥 and literally left no crumbs!🫣👍🏽
Conan next day: Hey "Dr." Arroyo, is this the sauce or blood? Or both? 🤔
Conan started to really channel Chris Farley craziness.
More Conan!!!  That charisma!
Loved it ❤
Please have Dr. Arroyo on as next guest. He was so good at giving very specific answers that also evaded the question somehow. You could have Conan yelling for him off screen too and he'd have to excuse himself from the interview to perform his doctorly duties
Never have i paid for any TV subscription service, but this Irish man is gonna change that
god bless conan. i haven't laughed this hard in a long time.
Not just a national treasure; a universal gem
This isn't an interview, this is a performance and a perfect one at that. Wow, just wow 👏👏👏
My favorite late night host ❤
Conan is GOATed
Jay Leno is just the absolute borderline-lowest class celebrity, and I love that Letterman, Conan, everybody else has proven their talent & class while Jay, his hack comedy and his asinine car collection have already quickly faded into deserved obscurity.
I haven’t laughed so hard in long time. “I’m fine!”
The only other person who was more daring than Conan was Steve-O.
Unpopular opinion but I didn't love this ep
Is this the first time a guest has vomited before leaving the stage?
Yea.... Best guest ever
17:15 Conan is a magician? He turned his water into milk.
I love how after a certain point, they were just two dudes hangin out while Conan descended into madness, performing his heart out
That was intense... 😂
My only wish is for Conan to talk more about the Simpsons.
An irish that take it better than Gordon. 😂
Wow
I love Conan, and I love Sean. But today, I think this was an absolute peak… To be able to interview someone like Conan, and still be good… Wow! Congrats, guys, absolutely phenomenal…
Conan did what i suppose he always hoped for in a guest??  Come in and carry the weight. Astonishing, really.
what a comedic genius Conan is
Commitment to the cause: Conan/10
best hot ones episode for me and its not even close
Conan definition of “you only lives once”
Assemble cocoians, let's make this most viewed hot ones video.
is it just me or does that Doctor look like wish version of Jordan Shclansky.
So funny how he said he grew up in an Irish household in Boston and never had spicy food. I moved from boston to Ireland 20 plus years ago and the spiciest food I've ever had was here
I can't stop laughing. Conan crushed it!
Finland mentioned! Torille!
What a fantastic episode
So much respect to Conan for his total commitment!!  You can see the pain in his eyes!
Pure Anarchic Comedy. Conan O'Brien, you are and always will be king.
i freaking love Conan
Goat
Can i watch his new show in switzerland?
i love love this , wishing you the best and for conan what a season ender
Put it in your eyes then we’ll see
If Bea Arthur isn’t safe, who is?? This is all so unhinged 10/10
I think the hot sauce really got to him. Highly paid lunatic. Baffling.
This is my favorite show and by far my favorite episode! How are y’all going to top this!? 🤣🤣🤣
imagine conan as a drinking buddy..
It always makes me happy when Sean gets appreciation for his interviewing skills
"The other guy" 😂he still hates Leno
BEST. EPISODE. EVER
what is this chaos
My buddy is with a very nice pretty girl who happens to be red headed. Well on a camping trip last year, I looked over during breakfast and thought she was eating tomatoe soup…..it was an omelette completely submerged in some crazy hot sauce. He said she kills multiple bottles a week. So on top of having no souls they also like to punish their sphincters
That Spice high must have been so good. Aside from laughing so hard tears came to my eyes, his last speech was really spectacular.
Conan is amazing 🤩 this is why he is one of my favorite comedians like truly one of the best
Is he on something?very entertaining.
so disgusting and playing with food,
conans come back!!! a GEM of a man!!!
this is hilarious
i love him
white man destroyed spicy things
That was a masterclass in professional chaos, I’m blown away 🤯
Ehhhhh I mean am I the only one who just doesn't find o Brian funny??
I love Conan. He's a mfn vibe.
Geez near 6 million views in 3 days. This is legendary already.
Best episode ever.
this was a work of art
The funniest one by far, and they are all good! What a way to sign off for the season.
i knew he’d be the best episode once he came on but gahdamn this was PERFECT 😂
Conan used to have the jerking bear on his show. The zookeeper used to tranqualize him to make him stop. 😂😂
This is the best episode ever I don’t think anyone well ever top it
L E G E N D
Magic
23:50 the sauce all laying there I LOLed
The only late night talk show host who is actually funny and talented.
🤣🤣🤣 that face! his mouth/face must be en fuego! great close!
This must be the best episode so far! Laughed my a** off! Conan killed it!
"Show business is, you're getting the greatest show in the world." And then he proceeds to give us exactly that. Conan doesn't just talk about principles, he commits to them. One of the best Hot Ones interviews ever, if not the best. The man is a legend.
Lol where did you go to school? umm 1998. I wouldnt trust that docter he cant even answer a simple question  😂
Conan doesn't have an angel and a devil - he has two Conans who egg him on 😂
you gotta love him . i think we have a new host :D
Unhinged in absolutely the best way
Well, that was unpleasant to watch
22:32 “What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I feel?” I thought Sean missed the emotional connection in this episode that he is legendary for when Conan drops this deeply personal revelation. A+
❤
well, here is another proof that Conan is the best of the best! brilliant!
Conan is the best lol
This is by far one of the best episodes of this show
Conan is the BOSS!!!
My lord ... 20:52 gets me 😂😂😂
When you think you ve seen it all ... Awesome show! Keep up the good work!
love u sean
man this is actually vile
just checking....is he still alive?
Conan beat Shaq
this was amazing
That was the best episode EVER. hahah Conan is the man.
This is F'ing G of Showmenship
Conan has reset the bar for those who will follow: expect more madness and true agony from those we adore...and want to see cut down to size.
This is a man who will not, and should not, go quietly into the night. Love him.
The hot sauces wasn't spicy for Conan, Conan was too spicy for the hot sauces though.
Conan is the GOAT!!! No question about that after this performance!
Wow!!! Impressive !! ❤ Conan!!
Greatest of all time
the last dab holds no meaning here
i respect conan alot more now. jeeez
Conan looks more and more like Tarja Halonen.
Best ever
Conan for life
Conan saved all his reactions of pain for the bowl 🚽
Best episode ever😂😂😂
What a show this was! The man absolutely annihilated the wings, one of the best shows of recent memory!
This was a truly moving experience. What a ride.
Never laughed this hard at First we Feast video
🤣❤
My God Conan!!
theres no way he ate all the wing and is cracking jokes.
Yikes
Conan the Hot Sauce Barbarian🫡
we have a new goat
you guys should really keep icecream on standby next to the milk and ice water
Conan was suffering thru those last wings but really embraced it 😭😭😭
Okay this was funniest hot ones episode I’ve seen. 😂
Seriously, the worst guest ever.  What a spaz.
"you're not a doctor, are you?"   "I-I should be" 😭
GOAT-ed
Coke
that'll clear up the brain worms for ai santa
Amazing
Instantly the best ever episode of Hot Ones. Conan is the greatest entertainer you could ask for.
Conan, you legend...the things you do for us.
Its been so long since i actually i cried of laugher.. i Truly am Thankful Conan
Gold. They'll never top that.
Doubt there could have been a better finale guest.  So much love to Sean and Conan, thank you both for an episode that I was neither deserving of nor ready for.
I'm crying out every last tear laughing
The episode ever ❤‍🔥
Amazing. I didn't really get Conan until I watched this. He made it his own show.
This is the greatest hot ones ever
Thats why he is the GOAT
Well No guest is going to do THAT ever again
I hope the wing drop becomes a thing.
This man is one of the greats.
The guys insane !!
Who would have thought that Conan would be the one to take the hot ones boss throne?? Been a fan since i was a kid but I legit didn't know he had this level of toughness/stupidity.
I’m subscribing to Max just for how committed Conan is to the bit. Holy moly
Yes
Best. Interview. Ever.
Truly Shakespearean.
This deserves to be the most viewed and most liked episode EVER. I came here to be entertained and laugh. Conan over delivered and then some. What a legend.
Definitely the best hot ones ever
Absolutely brilliant
What a great ep!
Sean was scared for him hahaha, great interview!
What a entertainer conan is the king hands down.
Move over last dab lol. Hot ones difficulty levelled up.
he strikes again, the comedic genius Conan
Connan dont give a F 😂
Hands down the guest thus far!
Goat for a fkn reason son❤
HHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
epic
The absolute greatest episode ever!!!! Laughed non stopped from start to finish... The doctor was crazy.... The ending was epic. Conan is a legend.
Fantastic
Calling it now. Most viewed episde of all time
I liked this before I even watched it. Ain’t watched this show in years.
8:27  Drinks from sauce bottle 22:25
"Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen." - Conan
Conon was all mind over matter when it came to the hot spice. He transcended beyond pain. Brilliant
"I have a show, it's on Max. They used to call it HBO, but people found that too popular. So now it's Max, cause that really rolls of the tongue." 24:56
This is that moment in LOTR when Legolas says that his fingertips are starting to tingle as Gimli falls over.
Conan always be the best  Peak Charisma 🔥🔥🔥 .as long as Conan is in the screen no one gonna notice anyone else My respect ❤❤
I can't he pretends to save it for later just so he wouldn't the whole thing so it wont be as spicy 😂
❤🔥🔥
hahahaha, this was huge!
For having his first spice at 52, I'd say Irish food has to be a great base to start from.
I think im actually gonna check it out 😂
Didnt realize this man was so hard
They should have hold off and dropped this video on april 18th
No one in hot ones history has ever done a last dab like that...jeeez😮😂😂
Bruh Conan FTW
Four years ago, I wondered if we'd ever be talking in person without masks.  Flash forward to now, Conan is ejecting fluids all over the set, having props shoved in peoples mouths
The GOAT
Best show ever
I love Conan, so unique and hiliarious
Best episode 😂🔥
I love this man
What a legend
Unpopular opinion--that was too much. kinda disturbing. Lol. Yikes
Ha ha ..superb fun !! 🤣🤣
This has got to be the most memorable Hot Ones ever.
CONAN IS A LIVING LEGEND
I'm sure he had to go to the hospital after the show! 🤦🏻‍♀️
I'm sure he's a nice guy, but I've never thought he was funny.
Conan gonna stright up punish his toilet later  I don't even have joke for that
Conan made everyone else who has ever been on this sauce look like weak sauce in a bottle, savagely devoured sauces no tonly wings, the way only a real man can.
Is it bad that I'm craving wings at 8.30 am?
COWNan OWNbrien
Holy mother of ducks. What did i just see? holy jesus. Conan destroyed every other guest before him.
Conan ❤
This will go down in history as one of the greatest Hot Ones episodes ever!
I've never laughed harder at an episode. Perfect choice for season finale 😅 Conan for president!!
He’s gonna be sitting on ice-cold washcloths in the morning …
That interview was just comedy gold. What a maniac!😂😂 I also didn't realize how big he is!!
I was raised on Irish Catholic food like Conan and cannot handle spicy at ALL, so the amount of commitment to act like it was nothing is absolutely mind blowing!!
"charlie rose show where you eat hot wings" 😭😭
Conan would either be really fun or terrifying to trip with.
Imagine if conan a serial killer
Dr. Arroyo, it's not the best......but it's very affordable 😂😂😂😂
This episode deserves everything. Love you conan.
Conan is a legend. But this episode is unwatchable. The fake doctor bit is not working at all. And the pouring hot sauce stuff is too much
Funny guy he is
I've never seen Sean look genuinely concerned at a guest, at the end there 😅
I always liked conan but i didnt think he was very funny untill now😂 what a legend
Hilarious 🤣👍
The Best Episode for me so far!!! Conan was a LEGEND!! by all means!! LOL about this, a very entertaining it was
That's how you do a finale and take on the challenge
Funniest episode of Hot Ones I’ve seen, possibly because I’ve been a Conan fan for a while… he is utterly hilarious. Man sacrificed to entertain us… what a legend! If anyone has got any other funny hot ones episodes to recommend please share.
not gonna lie, the ending was kinda nasty 😂
wow! this was something
That IS NOT Conan O'Brian - That's Conan O'Barbarian! 😈
You've been requesting Conan for years, we've been chasing Conan for years, and the Hot Ones interview has finally arrived! What was your favorite moment?
“Max” doesn’t roll off at all.  Not like Conan said it for decades on air with his band leader.
Conan is almost the literal definition of consummate professional. Kept me watching Late Night shows religiously
IF this is real...  Conan is the GOAT ggs
Easily one of the most unhinged episodes ever and I loved every second! Conan is a true comedian and lives 'commit to the bit'
Absolute legend
Conan doesn’t just meet all your expectations but goes a million miles further
Is he paranoid about leaving his DNA? Is this why he keeps his wings in the pocket?
Absolutely incredible. Greatest hot ones of all time. He’s not only a the best night show host but he’s a fantastic guest. Conan has been an inspiration for years.
Oh boy..Im going to go on another Conan YouTube binge. Thanks 👍🏻
Connan for the win 🎉🎉
Conan is king!
I need that jacket Conan has.
He's a Irish as the pope is African
Well I was not expecting that 😅 he’s madd, defo the best one 🙌🏻
Conan lived in New York, I'm sure he's had spicy food.
WOW.
Ok, I think he put wax on his tongue  at this point
Stupidly way overboard. Cringeworthy.
There will never be a late night show host like Conan. He is the BEST, along with Craig Ferguson.
Dear Conan, please release the water buffalo footage.
Man I love Conan.
I’ve been looking forward to seeing Conan on this show since its debut, and I’ll have to say, not only did he go beyond my expectations, he made my pants moist.
Jay Leno could never🤣
Please get Steve Carell on that would be amazing
Clueless Gamer : Cyberpunk with Keanu Reeves please!!!
What jacket is Sean wearing?
This man is the main guy
Wow dominate those wings
Call The Wife!! haha
Also... did anyone noticed Dr. Arroyo's blazing fast mental agility? obviously that guy is a comedian too but the guy was very sharp at every response, not breaking momentum and literally make it feel like the guy is clueless, but the cherry on top was having him actually letting everyone know the delta on Conan's temperature pre and post interview
what a legend 😂❤
Wow
The goat
😂😂😂😂
I feel genuine mirth watching this. Conan is a gift.
"Dr. Aroyo, can you get a baseline pulse here?" "Sure, sure!" *starts listening to the back of the neck*
Conan turned it up. I absolutely respect and appreciate Sean, Conan just made it x100. This is the best show ever!
how do you top this? Conan just gave a master class to Sean on how to host and take the opportunities to build momentum, brought his own jokes and used the bottles wings and milk as props to for jokes and even did self referential jokes for things that happened right there (putting a wing in the Doctor's pocket), there are just so many layers to this, I wouldn't be surprised if I find Conan has a very high IQ
Lol this guy's a maniac what's wrong with Conan lol
This might be the best interview ever. Truly saved the best for last
This is quite easily the most chaotic and hilarious episode I've ever seen. Holding back some full-on LOL's while commuting on a train into London on a miserable early Monday morning and this has made my week already
conan the best entertainer in the world
Conan is the best
Best crossover ever!,,
Man brought his own comedy routine to an interview he wasn't even hosting. What a legend. The rant at the end was the cherry on top. Even though it had me gagging, I have a lot of respect for someone who's not afraid to make a mess of himself just because it's funny. Conan will always be one of the greatest.
By leaps and bounds the BEST EPISODE YET!!😂😂😂😂CONAN IS THE BEST
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!
One, if not the greatest episode of all time.
this is probably the 5th time I watch the episode, Conan just gave a cathedra of how the host should be performing... between the lines a few times Conan let Sean know that he missed a couple of opportunities to elevate the intensity of the interview for sake of entertainment, very interesting!
did that man just chase pure concentrated chili pepper with another very spicy hot sauce?
Conan is a fkng lunatic, and I love him. Legit is fkng awesome, and super funny. He also IS my brain.
Conan just alphad him so hard. And it was the best yet :D
that final rant, if conan had started to slighty start mentioning a million more adventures and call sean morty i might not have noticed right away.
The best episode. Hands down.
Conan is absolutely cooked in the head lol
This was Ungodly Epic
Comic Genius
Hey Dr. Nick!
Somebody check on mans cus he not okay
Yo...my boy Conan was wildin. Lol Sean.....great job as usual.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
AMAZING
Best.. guest..ever
Bro, when Sean looks whiter than Conan... you know he's hurting.  What commitment to comedy lol, so good.
Quixote Sancho and Conan. Reaally funny those guys
What a masterclass of comedy and entertainment. Conan is king.
Conan is a national treasure
Conan ❤
Conan  revived this show , it had gotten stale  because of bad guests...
Now you *have* to get Larry David
Hands down the best guest and co-host on this show
He's the absolute goat for this 😂 puts all other guests to shame!! Guy coated all the wings with the sauces !! Conan the goat!!!! 😂
Red heads don’t feel anything.
disucsting
Am I the only one who was uncomfortable along with Sean? This was the worst interview ever
Connan!! you are the best!!!
There’s so much wisdom in him. He still works so hard.  Wish Conan all the best
He has my eternal respect for this
Conan is a legend!
Epic. The best episode.
Conan!!!!!
Good lord this man is the GOAT! I knew it was gonna be good. I was seriously surprised how well he handled the heat though
“He’s not a good doctor. He’s an affordable doctor.” This whole episode was just about perfect.
Man. Conan really committed. I’m still not going to watch that show, but he went full idiot to try and convince me to. That’s dedication.
Conan is insane.
I have never laugh out loud during any of the hot ones episodes! Now I am laughing and clapping all the way! Conan! You made my day.
"You're not a Dr are you?"  "I should be" 😂😂😂 absolute genius!
Conan and Dr Oroyo felt like an old Marx Bros routine!
Dude's great he should have his own show!
That battle roar should be the intro to every episode from now on.
"Whats wrong with me?!Why can't I feel?!"  I spit my food out 😂
It doesn’t get much better than this, Conan is forever
Conan is a master of physical comedy. His interaction with Dr. Arroyo was neither cringy nor awkward.
Conan 🎉🎉🎉❤
Conan made art out of this episode! He's iconic.
Dang, Conan just out sauced you. Drank the bottle he schooled you dawg. Love conan. He just reached a status. No other guest has done this.
that was funny
The KING of comedy. There is no superlative for Conan.
👏👏👏👏👏👏😊👏👏👏👏👏👏
22:31 I ask the same thing daily Coco.....
With his brain/face/innerds  on absolute fire, when most normal humans couldn’t put a sentence together…he spits out “…it used to be called HBO but people found that too popular..”, the funniest line of the show, and one of those lines that will be repeated in every situation by folks like me (“they used to have great service here, but people found that too popular”)…an absolute legend.
Masterpiece of entertainment, that is how you do this kind of thing 👏 🙌 ✨️ ❤️ 😄 👌 👏 🙌 ✨️ ❤️ 😄 👌 👏
5 minutes in and I realise he is basically gonna be advertising this new show through the whole video. Nah. No thanks, I'm skipping this one.
Wow
Conan is a one man army hero I love him and respect him so much he’s a man🎸🎸🎸🎸
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conan is the GOAT!
God love a man who gives his own colon to comedy. Coco took over the show, made it his, splashed pepper juice all over his dead victorian skin, just to give us Zillenials some joy.
LEGEND !!!!!
Anyone who saw Conan on Murderville manage the sloppy jalapeñ-joes knew he had this in the bag. 👏👏👏
6:25 Why has no one pointed this out?? The other guy lol
Haven't laughed this hard in a while LOL Conan's amazing
Don't know who the "doctor" was, but his improv lines were spot-on. That Conan guy wasn't bad, either.
This may be my favorite since Bobby Lee.
If Jordan shlansky was here…can you imagine?!?!
This episode will go down in history as
Best one ever lol
Sean saying Oh My God ! Numerous times. Captures all of our anxieties 😂  He MUST have broke a record. I Don't think any guest has done this ..... 🎉
Probably the best guest to date!
Can someone check on Conan, is he still alive after this?
21.07 oh yeh
OMFG JEEZ i have never seen Conan like that before but he a og.
I was crying at the end from laughter. Conan is a master of the craft. Wow lol 😂
Conan is an amazing human. When I used to watch tv I liked watching his talk show
Conan becoming unhinged at the end is peak, absolute king 👑
Conan is the GOAT
Next Jordan Schlansky 😂
Videos are so well made 👌
If there's one man I'd wish could live forever, it's Conan. What an absolute LEGEND!
OMFG this has been the best one yet. I was left in tears laughing!!
That was just about the best thing ever! Thank you.
They say redheads have a higher tolerance for pain. Chalk one up for O’Brien!
One of my favorite episodes now and i've been watching since the start.
I'm so grossed out I can't look at him towards the end. 💀
this is Gordon Ramsey Level Legendary.
Conan is a madman
Charlie Rose with hot wings 😂
Brilliant! Entertaining masterclass
Conan Al Gaib, such a god tier episode.
I watched his eyes get bluer.
Not a fan of the "suspense" music you used for this episode. Wrong music in my opinion for Conan.
This was the best episode ive seen
Conan is one of the naturally funniest people with great charisma. Anything he's in is pure entertainment
That was too much. He does too much lol.
God-tier episode
Best episode ever!!!
I havent laughed this much over a hot ones guest! I love conan!
He drank it😮.  Conan for dune 3. The true master of spice.
Maybe the funniest hot ones episode ever
😂 I loved the skits from the Conan shows, I totally thought that was his real doctor. When you kept seeing salvia come out of his mouth and the milk go in and out like a mouthwash 😂 also can’t imagine the fire that’s gonna come out of his behind later, props.
Who talked him in to this...? 😮
Might be my favorite right here...pretty sure it's the favorite. Love you Conan.
Conan' face was turning into the Joker as the show progressed. Without artificial makeup. All natural.  Who can turn on makeup like that. A true showman!!
That was a really good one. 👍🏾
Holy shitballs! This is the best 27 minutes of content I've seen since the pandemic first glued us to our screens. Wow & wow & more wow.  Obviously the "top of the mountain" for Hot Ones and the #1 episode.  How do you even try to follow this?!?!? Good thing this was the finale & I sincerely hope CoCo is ok lol.  Conan is a comedy legend and after 30+ years he continues to step it up for laughs.  Amazing.  Wish it was a full hour!
hands down the BEST EPISODE SO FAR
This video will go down as absolute legendary. Conan is amazing
By far the best hot ones episode I've seen, conan was in peak form mixing comedy with insanity that he does so well.
I want next day follow up on guests like this.  It can't be pretty!!!  Ice cubes and TUCKS required!
this is literally the funniest thing online at the moment and the funniest episode by FAR!~!
I love this guy 😂
😂😂😂
what a legend lol
“I’ve never FELT so alive!” 🤣
Favorite moment... Ahh Wooo Ahh Wooooo spinning in the stool!
He is gonna have the worst $hits of his life lol
Truthfully amazing. This is perfect comedy for any year, years 0-22222...... I feel bad for those who try and follow this entire interview, grade A
why was this low key inspiring lol
What a comedy masterclass by Conan
MY FAVORITE COMEDIAN EVER! I’m so so glad you had him on! Thank you so much. I LOVE Conan
The water buffalo is now Godfather to Conan's kids and was best man at his wedding
Nice!
One of the best ever!
This might be the best thing ever.
Good luck to those who have to follow Conan.
The doctor choking Conan 😂 I died
I don't even really like Conan but that was pretty awesome.
I've been watching hot ones from its inception and this the GOAT episode. Outstanding 😂
I sincerely hope that Conan breaks this and the post-hot-sauce experience in his podcast!
Am I the only one getting Sean doesn't dig Conan and kinda annoying?
This is the best ever hot ones episode 🤣🤣🤣 I'm dying 🤣🤣🤣 he even drank it like it was nothing.
I truly believe Conan lives at 100mph 😂 it’s amazing to watch
This is an interview for the ages. I laughed so hard. Legendary.
Holy s*** that was not expected
22:20 I thought to I was about to hear Jurassic Park theme.
I'm convinced Conan could lift a car if he thought it would get a laugh. The man's commitment knows no bounds.
Jesus, Conan is all energy. And I love it.
I’m here to listen to the guest compliment Sean and his questions.   I’m never let down.
He sipped the last dab!!!!!!! 22:25 SPICE LEADER!!!!!!
Why would any animal handler let him sit on a freaking water buffalo?
“I bet you live 4 more years, tops”  🤣
This man can make anything, literally anything, funny. There's never been a television personality quite like Coco.
Conan is the man. Seriously. I love this man.
Legend!
So ... this was a Conan show with Sean guest-hosting it 😛
Conan has always been one of my heroes and here he is again to save the day. Thank you and I love you. Can't wait for your new adventure.
Why still sitting so far apart? seems awkward.
Love the subtle Leno slam--"the other guy?  who knows what was going on there."
Conan!!!!!!!!!! So glad he is on here, can't wait to watch a hilarious episode!!
Conan just made the best Feast episode ever and at 61! He’s even funnier then he was 30 Years ago. We love ya Coco😊
Conan is insane😂
He slowly devolved into all my aunts.
National treasure.   Most don’t know how good they’ve had it.
18:59 Conan giving Shawn next level guidance.
No one has ever gone so hard
Xperience is weak AF
There he goes. One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die.
Absolute Legend!
18:57 - Sean admires Conan's commitment to the bit, Conan says it's life, not a bit, and immediately orders his doctor to probe Sean's tongue
Dude just burned a hole the size of Texas in his stomach lining for this show and put every other guest to shame in the process. Conan, the undisputed Legend.
How is anyone ever supposed to top this!? 😂
HOLY SHXT!! LOL 😂
Conan O'Brien is 1 in a million dude.
That was amazing 😂😂
He sipped the spices!! The New Spice Leader! 14:00
Oh my god. Conan. A national treasure. And a madman.
So good.
I don't know why, but I lost it every time Dr. Arroyo popped in. 😂
This is.. Insanity and I absolutely loved it 😂 wow. I just... Cannot properly wrap my head around what just happened. Definitely gonna have to watch this one again 😂  Hats off to you, Mr. Conan. Absolutely crushed this 😂😂
Conon is solid shine. He rocked this. Towards the end of the episode he reminded me of Robin Williams.  I think Robin would have approved. Great episode.
its so funny that you can perfectly see conan's comedy brain recalculating: He knew the funniest thing would be to come on super braggadocios and then immediately start dying, but then ended up doing a lot better than he himself anticipated, so he had to like QUADRUPLE down on the bit 😂.
This is why Conan is the GOAT!
I mean, gingers have higher pain tolerance genetically, lol
F'n GOAT 😂❤
I love you, Conan. You madman.
conan this worked i watch ur show hahaha
Conan complimented your interview skills would be like Micheal Jordan complimenting your fade away shot.
Conan is my hero!!!! ❤❤❤
Best episode ever
Conan is the only late night show host who actually has sense of humor.
I've loved Conan for years my mom use to get annoyed cus she liked Letterman or Leno more. I knew this was gonna be incredible lol.
I FKN ❤ CONAN FOREVER!!!!!!
Every time he called the Dr. in I couldn't help but think of Dr. Nick Riviera.  Conan was the "Bomb Beyond Insanity" pf guests, he took it to that next level for sure
Goated
I love Conan haha. That was great lol ❤
I love how "water buffalo" comes up immediately when you type in Conan O'brien into Youtube.
He did amazing. Honestly the best episode.
Rename this show “Hot Conan”
Conan broke the show.  I can’t watch another episode where someone is crying about the first wing.  I don’t understand what I watched, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they made this season their last.  It’s been a good run.
Best interview EVER
“Why can’t I feel?!” 😂
Sean has the magnetism of a doorstop
Cony still got it.
Hands down the best so far! Conan is a legend.
This had me in tears 🤣
The sound he makes at 20:28 hes done several times in his show /skits. 😂 he loves that sound
In a way, Conan was the water buffalo during this interview and Sean just had to hang on for dear life through sheer insanity.
All hail the King!! Love u Conan❤ Hope I get u watch & listen to u for another decade...Never change🙏
Brilliant!!!! 🔥
Conan is the funniest person alive.
Whoa. He’s gotta see a doctor
why cant i feel
Truly unhinged. Conan is a living legend.
I genuinely feel bad for the show, because no interview will ever be as good as this one. This was the Hot Ones peak, everything is downhill from here.
Wow, mad respect. What a terrific interview
this is the best interview on Hot Ones ever.
1st episode I ever see, came for Conan, LOVED IT (*him)😂
should brought JordanSchalnsky
I miss this dude on Late Nights
Conan comically battling through Da Bomb was pretty hilarious.
The best episode. I feel the term is overused, and I mean this unironically, in my eyes Conan is a national treasure.
That is by far the funniest episode that I have ever seen!
20:27 i swear he made that same noise on one of his food remote but i cant remember which one XD
BEST HOTONES EVER
This energy lol, this is why Conan was the GOAT of late night.
Conan is one of just a few (imo) absolute geniuses in comedy. If you've ever watched his late night shows, or his previous travel shows, it's clear that this man is not only a genius who is up for doubling down on anything presented, but the quips that roles off his tongue spontaneously in every conversation is hilarious! Brilliant interview from a brilliant interviewer interviewing a brilliant interviewer.
this might just be the goat hot ones
Conan is diamond
Conan is gold
this is one of the best hot ones
I use to not care for conan but over several years i started to watch him and hes the most genius and funniest talk show host/comedian ever. Seriously brilliant 😂
Not all angels have wings…but if they did Conan would eat them with hot sauce
Aaaaaaaaaaaand now this is my favorite Hot Ones episode lol
Conan: "Isn't this the season finale?" Sean: "It is now."
Awesome interview!!!! Oh man the wings in the pocket it got me rolling
What a National Treasure 🎉🎉🎉 We love you coco
He absolutely destroyed this lol. Put everybody else to shame 😂
I love Conan, but this was a very difficult episode to watch. I have never seen a host not uncomfortable with Conan as a guest, and Sean certainly seemed uncomfortable here
This has been my favorite episode by far. Conan is such a comedic gem. I'm so glad he's having a Renaissance. Can't wait to watch his new show! 🍗
THIS IS INSANE!!! What else do you need to know that this man is the best show host ever in history. Conan is the goat
I seriously think Conan is dead. He may have walked away, but the next morning all his insides came out in a train wreck of gastrointestinal disaster.
Next up is Sona.
#2 smokey J? Or smoke ah J?
Absolute legend. That was amazing, entertaining and hilarious. God I love this guy.
That was unhinged, and I'm here for it.
The funniest talk show host ever
Fantastic 😂🎉
That was one of the most unhinged things I have ever seen.
I think we accidentally found yet another Joker candidate lol
It was everything I wanted but imagine they give him a Guinness instead of milk.
might be the best hot ones ever
I don’t comment on videos like ever , but CONAN IS THE GREATEST EVER , GREATEST THERE IS AND WILL BE
Conan... my god... what a legend!
So excited to see the season end like this! Conan has been my dream guest for a long time. My face hurts from all the laughing. Needed the laughs among the crazy right now
“Where did you go to medical school?”  “Uhh, in 1998.”  😂
conan is beyond chaotic neutral
Watching more than any other episode!
I have never laughed out loud from watching a hot ones episode...til today. this was effing hilarious
THE GOAT!!!
The video was entertaining but i didn’t find it funny. It was definitely well performed and obviously conan is good at doing what he does, but gross humor is just not for me!
I want to like this 100x
Conon never disappoint
Dr Arroyo. Heh
I love Conan.
conan is the best❤❤❤❤
This is my favorite of all time!!!!!!!!!
I thought a baked potato would be too spicy for Conan but, here we are.
Conans the BEST!
This is legendary. I think this tops Gordon #2 for me.
Best ever guys great
RIP Conan, 2014
He more than dabbed Da Bomb! That sauce is no joke
Love this show!!! Love Conan! This episode was pure gold.
Coco is the best  He so cool to watch
Conan O'Brien, The Hot Ones Champion.
God I love you Conan. Grateful you were born on this rock.
This just might be the greatest hot ones episode ever recorded
You know what, im not a Conan fan. I was weirded out the first half, but I respect the commitment and this actually ended up being supreme entertainment. 😂
Conan is the greatest
Hot Ones has an official GOAT
Best guest, unequivocally.
can we all agree that this was the greatest episode ever done to date?
Overrated comedian.
I don't get it. He ate chicken with some sauce on it and drooled snot while talking about the Bible. This is the "Baby Fish Mouth" of YouTube.
disappointing.  never took the concept seriously.  kind of disrespectful to sean.  prop sauces.  no way he could have handled that heat.  his eyes never even watered.
Love how he insulted his while families cooking
I think this is my favorite hot ones episode so far!
Epic, Conan for the WIN!
I started out thinking, "There's no way I'm watching all 27 minutes of this." I watched all 27 minutes of this.
Team coco assemble 😂
Dear Conan, Thanks.
Conan O'Brien's picture should be in the dictionary under the (newly created) entry of Comedic Genius.
Legendary.
Redheads have a higher tolerance for spicy foods 😂
Okay, this episode was really great entertainment!!!!
Best one yet.
❤  Brilliant episode. So funny! 😂  Sean you were cracking up there.  Would you say that was the funniest guest in all your 23 seasons?
Best episode hands down
I think this is my favorite episode ever .  Gonna be hard to top.   I mean drinking straight from the bottle ?  How do you top that?  Onward and upward and spicy as ever !  Nice fucken job with the interview too!! Obrien rules!!
Wow great actor comedian what a great man
The best hot ones interview ever hands down. 2mil scoville and he made it seem like it was siracha sauce LOL
🤣🤣🤣 Conan had me rolling!
Dumbfounded feels mild... TAME EVEN. For the raw entertainment value of this episode. Conan and Sean, this was incredible.
Conan is Proof Redheads have no souls.
Conan is the GOAT
loved the added animated scenes
That vein popping out near his right eye LOL
This is the funniest thing i've ever seen. Thank you so much for this.
Let's see the spice King from YouTube. Great job Conan.  You crazy lol
One this has got to be in my top 5 of favorite interviews now. Wow😂😂😂
Conan is one of a kind. Love that dude can't wait to watch the new show
Conan is hilarious!!!! 🤣🤣🤣 He is so funny. This is the funniest episode I have ever watched!
Best show ever...  pure comedy with some serious pain management.
Where did you go to medical school? -in 1998 😂
This makes up for the Ice Spice episode and then some. Hot Ones has officially peaked!
Im so glad so see this guy break free from traditional media.
Conan is a crazy ANIMAL ! Best episode ever !
Long live the King 👑
Oh god do not rub your eyes conan please!
Jokes aside, I found his spice-induced rant about looking high and low for comedy to be quite genuine and shows how much love he has for the whole artform.
Conan has set the bar. ALL HAIL CONAN.
This video wasn't an interview, it was a whole experience...both pros indeed
CALLLL THE WIFEE!!!
This was the most fun I've had watching this show. Conan for the win!
Conan O'Brien is the man!
Conan is such a good human being
what a amazing finale lol
The BEST. 😂
National treasure Conan O'Brian dies following accidental overdose.
Best freakin episode 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Reminds me of how Conan has been mopping all the late night hosts same as how he mopped that chicken on the wooden board. Absolute comedy genius!!
Somebody please stop him😂😂😂
This is so unhinged and it's unreal
Conan is my hero
This is THE best episode of all time. I haven't laughed this hard in a very long time. Absolute Legendary Performance. In Awe.  You say this is pure pepper?  Where did you go to Medical School? 1998. Can you check my pulse? It's there.
Sean, I've watched this show for many, many seasons and I think this may be one of my all-time favorites. Conan is a legend. What a great way to end the season.
I miss Conan so much.
Conan is the GOAT
22:59
I just died!!!
When "Dr" Arroyo opens Da Bomb we all said the same thing, "oh no".
Biggest mic drop and best end to a hot ones season
Conan overacts too much. I'm sure people think its good video but I think that was a little sad and needy
Not good? i didnt even know he was sick.
would've been better if Conan had livestreamed his half from the beautiful oasis of Haiti
Wow!
Rides a water Buffalo,didn't learn from his mistakes as he licks one of the hottest wings. Didn't learn😂. This guy is great!
I hope Conan goes to Haiti on his new show.
I'd love to see Craig Ferguson in this
This is one of the best hotones episodes i have seen.  the end was amazing 😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉
Leave it to Conan to bring an affordable doctor to the interview 😂😂😂
best guest by far!!
How did they not talk about schlansky
One of the, if not THE greatest talk show hosts of all time. Entertaining to the point where you don’t even have to come for the guests, just him.
conan is savage. his crazy overpowered the capsaicin. lol
Unhinged (free from networks) Conan is my favorite Conan. This might be my favorite Hot Ones ever and that's saying a lot.
@22:45, Conan and Sean are clearly experiencing pain...  Meanwhile, the background music is "Calm Sunrise".
who knew Conan was Alex Jones in real life?
I love Conan 😂
Thank you, Conan. Thank you.
Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales are hilarious! Thank you Conan!!
This episode was beautiful. I laughed so hard 🤣🤣🤣
Finalllllllllyyyyyy
Absolutely the best episode 🤣 🤣
This is single-handedly the most amazing thing I’ve seen on the internet in the last 5 years. What a professional.
This was the best episode ever! Conan is a comedic genius.
Gandhi , popeye and I said it 😂
this is make the top tier of FWF interview
Conan just made me laugh so hard I cried tears of joy that we exist in the same timeline.  I hope I can meet him and thank him for the laughs someday!
Best Episode!!
That made my life infinetely better
Rewatched back to back 😹
Has anyone checked on Conan lately?? Is he ok?? 😂😂
Best episode ever
Conan Remotes are always fun to watch. Hopefully he still have his old crew
As expected, Conan is still unhinged. Thank goodness!
He really is the GOAT
Such a good hot ones episode. One of the best
I love Conan
This is already a GOATED episode.
Love Conan! so excited to watch this!
i can't believe what I just witnessed. I want to say this is the pinnacle of Hot Ones, but I'm going to hold out hope for what we might get in the next season. Hats off to Conan, what a legend
i just had to remind myself that nothing is worse than the bobby lee episode
To crush your sauces, see them spilled before you and hear the lamentations of Sean Evans.
Outstanding!!!!!
This is what happens when you let us spice-tolerant gingers out during the day 😂
In a better timeline this man got to stay the host of the Tonight Show.
It's official, you need to interview a politician
Maybe he needs to be more humble
This was horrible he needs to wipe his mouth
Get Shane Gillis on
Conan is the funniest person alive
Thank you Conan for finally saying it! Sean is an INCREDIBLE interviewer. It might be the 1st reeason I watch this show.
Insane!!
this has to be my favorite episode ever. hahahahah
I will never fear wings again after watching this! Conan kills it!
Conan is a treasure.
You probably know this, but it would be good to drink buttermilk if something is too spicy.
I didnt think i could love Conan anymore
No one beats Gary Vee at eating wings, but conan sure was on of the funniest guests ever.  bravo.
Great guest
That was the greatest episode of this already great show that I have ever seen
MY FAVORITE GUEST! Absolutely love Conan O’Brien! ❤Been watching him since I was 12 years old and he NEVER misses 😂
Conan is a madman, what a great show!
Conan is insane love it
Man this episode got me smiling from end to end
best episode ever
best episode ever.
Drinking hot sauce while saying “Why can’t I feel anything?” Conan killed this episode!
What is there left to do than just change the last sauce and re-name it to Conan because nothing is going to match the pure unbridled manic spicy content than the man himself.
Bro got 5.4 million views in just 3 days. 😱 👏🏼
Best guest yet, Conan is my favourite comedian he is where I get my humour from
ive watched every episode, this is without a doubt the best one, hands down best guest. hahahahaha
GOAT
D O G E C O I N
EPIC ENDING
I kept saying out loud "Stop it Conan!"
You should invite Rick Warren, he is a fan of Hot Sauce ☺️
My entire family watched this on edibles and died laughing
Man took a swig off the bottle 🤣😅
how the last quarter of the show wasn't a part of the first 10 second intro lololol
Best episode ever!
hahahahahahahaha I can't stop laughin gosh.., he couln't be disrupted by the wings... he disrupted the wings haahahaa
Ive never laughed so much in an episode, this was pure AAA comedy 😂
The best ever.
Anyone else think Conan is literally not funny at all.. super annoying but not funny
Conan is a LEGEND
By the end of this he had fully morphed into a David Lynch character played by David Lynch
Conan is incomparable and a true legend.  Best Hot Ones Ever!!! I'm still laughing...
One of the best episodes I have seen. Laughed so hard. Conan is a beast and a legend.
Can I keep these? 😆
Single best episode ever. Conan has been the absolute comedy king in my life for almost 30 years.
An instant classic!! Conan is King!!
Best HOT ONES guest and show EVER!!! Way better than coachella!! 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Most unhinged guest ever; greatest episode of all time
Amazing
he's forever a legend
I know he went to the hospital after this as pink as he got😂
Missed opportunity for the doctor to say "4 years, tops" when he checked seans tongue
my man conan looks like denethor when demolishing that tenth wing
I am crying I am laughing so hard
Absolute legendary episode. Conan is the 🐐
ABSOLUTE-🎤-DROP
This is number one now!!!!🎉💯😎
Putting the wings in the jacket pocket… what a power move.
My bday is 4/18 as well.  i party to hard for you though Conan.
One word to describe Conan O'Brien. Legend.
That was amazing! Best episode yet!
Best episode ever, best guest ever!
Conan is a hot sauce machine if that was real
Haven't watched the show in months for a good reason (snoresville) but came back for conan
I love Conan! Been watching him since I was a kid in the 90s. He literally killed this entire episode!  Nothing makes me happier!!! I can die happy, Conan, thank you for all you've done in the comedy world. My life wouldn't be the same without you! Sean, this moment, and many others wouldn't be possible without you. Let's keep up the funny! Love you both!
Conan is the new king of the wing!!!
I’m wondering if Conan had a few shots of Tequila before this.🤣
THE GOAT
Best guest so far
It has been a long time since I’ve seen an episode even close to this fun or unhinged. this is what the show was meant to be and this is an all time episode hahahah
I think this may be the only time I watched an entire episode I’m one sitting. Absolutely hilarious. 11/10.
I have to admit, Conan is pretty impressive with his level of self-control to sit there and act like he could not feel the burn.
Best interview shi was hilarious
Giving Irish ppl spicy food is like throwing a metal fork into a microwave and coating it with tin foiul then hitting high for 1 hr.
Incredible
I guess I have reup my hbo max subscription!
Top 3 episode of all time and is not 2 or 3!
Oh man. Hope the guy remembered to wear gloves when he peed…
23:50 the sauce pouring out of the bottle as Conan rants a lesson is the funniest thing I've seen all week.
I think this is the pinnacle.
Conan set the standard by which all other Hot Wings shows will be judged.  I am in awe!
I feel like Conan O Brien would be the closest real life personality to the Joker that we could possibly have
Ive never seen a single show this guy has hosted, so I was not expecting anything that happened.
Conan is now at the top of my list for the best interview on this show. This was undeniably amazing!
I just gained so much respect for Conan.  Great guest!
Best that’s it
Please tell me there's an interview of Sean watching this interview and breaking down what he was thinking of during it, cause this was crazy and amazing.
Sore jaws from laughing best episode yet
Wing drop!
This might be the best episode of hot ones
This was the best episode of hot ones that ever existed
I have never seen something that is both pure chaos so well planned.  That was so great.  Hands down the best episode I have seen.
One of the best Hot Ones!!!! Hahahaha!
THAT RULED⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️ CONAN FOREVER!⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
Dr. Arroyo is writing a tell-all book, and it will be revealed that Conan had his taste buds surgically removed years ago. That's why he could be so over indulgent with the hot sauces.
Poor Sean was taking dabs just like Conan and none of it got shown 🤣🤣
Conan is built different
HAS ANYONE CHECKED ON CONAN. Legend. A concerning legend; but a Legend. 🙌🏼
Invoke Nature Boy Proceeds to completely no sell Da Bomb What a flex!
This dude is showbusiness
Am I the only one that found that very hard to watch?
The only episode I watched more than once!!
😂the best
Loved the episode!
I think Conan just beat the game. Roll credits.
I am very pleased with the performance here. Loved it. Appreciated.
Would never watch this show unless Conan is on this garbage
YAY Finally! Everything we hoped for, wisdom and pure proffesionel entertainment Conan is love
The only thing better would have been if Conan made Jordan Schlansky eat the wings instead.
Conan is the best guest on this show ever.
Conan put Salma Hayek to shame, and she's the real deal.
Conan O'Brian tries really hard
the moment after da bomb is pure insanity. 🤣
Best. Hot Ones. Episode. Ever. Period.
Are you feeling it now Mr. Krabs.
4:46 Finland mentioned! TO THE MARKETPLACE!
Never saw a man take to the contrast-threaded denim jacket quite as readily as Conan . . .
he's been prepping for years for this, that's why this took years to get him. 😂  no but really, Conan is a genius. this had me laughing so hard.
this was the best one of them all.
that was incredible
omfg.
YEEEsSs!!!
This is by far the best episode I’ve watched
I know this would be a reach... But Conan needs to go on a Dropout show. Game Changer would be insane with Conan honestly.
Conan is a person who doesn't let life live him. What an absolute stud! We may never have another entertainer of his caliber again.
Sheeeeeshhh!!
Quickest an episode has flown by
Behold, the new Hot Ones Champion.
Holy smokes. I haven't laughed so hard I cried since I dunno when. The hard-cut to Conan leaking fluids and staring into space after the last sauce- holy smokes.
Everything is a Bit with Conan. I wonder what he is like in real life, or is this who he is?
this was probably one of the most hilarious episode ever where the guest was controlling the show I barely saw sean on this episode
Okay, Conan acting all sus! Taking his DNA with him being all superhuman!
This was Conans show.
This is Connan O'Brien's Hot ones!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this is the first one that i have turned off before the end.
11:10 same thing that happened to Logan paul. Its because he did a vlog every day . got lost on the sauce
Conan is the best!!!! ❤ u Conan!!
i have NEVER laughed so hard at an episode of Hot Ones as i did this one. Conan is comedy gold and as unhinged as this all looked you KNOW he was in absolute complete control the whole time. Best episode ever! Thank you for getting this legend on! 👏 👏👏👏
Wonder how he felt afterwards lol
One of the best interviews
Possibly one of the best episodes ever
Conan is amazing and a great guy
They need sketch on this show
conan is the best
We have just witnessed greatness first hand.
love him
I have loved Conan since I was very very young. This exemplifies every single reason why. One of the greatest entertainers to have ever lived.
One of my favorite celebrities and been around my whole life. Dude never misses. I also highly recommend reading Chaucer too.
5.4 million views good lord! One of the greatest entertainers he is. The closest one in recent is a over 1 mil.
Love Conan !!! I was laughing so hard I woke my husband up from a deep sleep
Conan is a legend, the  King, and the GOAT all rolled into one.
This is the first entry in the Hot One's Episode Hall of Fame. Wow!!!
Awesome!
THIS ONE A LUNG BUSTER OHHH MY GOD
Gives a presidential speech at the very end❤
Hes always been my most favorite night host.
Years of medical school, residency and ultimately fullfilling your dream as a doctor, to end up storing Conan O'Brian's half-eaten wings in your lab coat.
Honestly I think it's pretty weird not even in a good way, that Conan would go in and out of his "funny ditch" persona. And the decision to bring a "funny doctor". This is a great interview without all that.
Greatest Hot Ones episode of all time!
CALL THE WIFE
This was the best episode
Best episode by far, love Conan 🎉
Literally the best guest on this show ever, don’t think this episode can be topped, hang it guys. Shows finally hit its final episode. Like the Beatles being number one, anyone after this will just be another copy cat.😂
Wow! Amazing episode! Conan going on a C̶o̶c̶a̶i̶n̶e̶ Pepper-X fueled rant there at the end is one of the top moments of all time, and I've been watching ever since Sean almost killed Coolio.
Best episode by far.
What a legend 😂
this is in my top 5 episodes. only reason it’s not #1 is bc conan did too well with the heat
is this not the greatest hot ones of all time ???
Conan gave us a better Eric Andre episode than Eric Andre
Dude is a maniac. I expected this from Eric Andre 😂
Conan is unstoppable, an absolute mad lad. He's always been great but having him on now where i believe he is in his peak form is nothing short of spectacular. I look forward to his Now shows & Remotes, it was possibly his best work from his Talk Show Host days and now fully realized to a stand alone series after all these years.
A true master of his craft.
Wow, that was the craziest episode to date. The look on Sean’s face when Conan starts drinking the insanely hot sauces is priceless.😮 I have to say, I hope Conan doesn’t end up hospitalized from his own recklessness.
Wow, he literally wrecked the place!  What an amazing maniac!
I liked everything about this interview........except for the doctor gag, that got run into the ground quickly
You really need to get Brent Underwood on from the Ghost Town Living channel - He just release a book about the old Silver Mine Cerro Gordo he bought in the start of Covid.  It has been years now that he has been rebuilding the site.  He is extremely knowledgeable and he would make an excellent guest on Hot Ones.
This is the best episode ever
My mom actually went to Brookline HS in Massachusetts with Conan, and said that he was just gifted with humor even then. Odd, but gifted humor.   Seems to check out!
I've watched this at least 5 times now.
Channeling Chris Farley
I think this is what "beating Hot Ones" looks like.
This man went even harder than Coolio
Conan, beyond any doubt you are BY FAR the baddest mother f@cker that's ever lived !!! You ate them all, and in plenty doses. You gave pain to those chicken wings and their sauses, and you didn't even flinch ! Instead, you ROCKED the show in you own special way ! Bravo ! You are a pure LEGEND ! The GOAT of First We Feast...👌🏻😉👏🏻🐐💪🏻😎🙌🏻
I've love conan so much. As far as comedy goes....that MF still got it!  This episode cracked me up.
I want to be Conans friend, I want him to know me so bad 😫
Dudes a total beast
That episode was kind of cringey but I know why he did it. I would just love to see Conan fully humbled one of these days though, not just trying to get attention always. I just say that with love and I say that from someone who has watched a lot of Conan O'Brien
LOL hes pocketing his left over eaten wings? hahah
I wish I could be real life friends with Conan
Too bad this isn't the series finale. I don't think anyone will top Conan, I've watched it twice. Best episode of all time
i thought steve o was crazy but conan took it on another level and for a moment there, took control of the show
This is the greatest thing i ever watched.
I find it funny that he still calls those random location a “remote”
He's taking all the wings so they don't get his alien DNA
Sean lost control of this one very early… and it was hilarious!  Not the best *interview*, per se, but still excellent!
Best one ever. Conan is King.
Hands DOWN. My favorite episode of Hot Ones. 🔥
You know, over time, I've come to watch this show for the interviews instead of the wing reactions because of how good of an interviewer Sean is. But this is the first time in a long time that the reactions were the best part.
The best episode ever
Now THAT'S comedy!
conan knew the objective here and didn't just nail it, he hit a grand slam without the bases loaded
Sounds like Conans show is influenced by Ricky Gervais/Karl Pilkingtons "An Idiot Abroad" lol and im all for it.
He did all of that and didn’t stutter on a single word
Conan’s final spiel while crazed really speaks to the heart in all its glory
What a hilarious man.
Still one if the funniest people ever
Conan is such a class act.
WE NEED JOE PERA
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Master piece 🎤
This might be the best episode ever
I love how he became so unhinged after the Monoloco, Sean didn't even ask him a question. Conan completely derailed the interview with his insanity.
One of my all time favorite celebrity
Best episode ever.
Man he’s a nut
He is beyond legendary
This was the Citizen Kane of Hot Ones. Be pretty hard to top.
Is it just me or does it look like The Last Dab turned into Tabasco sauce? Last time I checked it was thick as molasses?? Still funny Af.
Sean, you didn't show some of your pre-bite dabs. How much sauce did you add to yours?😮
this is fantastic
One of the best shoes I've seen in a while! Definitely will go down as a legendary episode
The way his face starts to match his hair😂
My favorite mediocre President, Obama..
"I admire a guy who hosts Hot Ones and wears beautiful suede" lol
I watched him all my life growing up. I knew he had an extremely high iq. This episode just blew my mind though. Dude is a savage!
No doubt he was in pain the entire time. Comedic legend would die for a laugh. Legendary!
Awesome !!! 🤣
I see Conan's history background quite a bit in this show.
Just wow! I love this guy!
Best episode EVER, Fight me
He's the best in show biz ❤
Anyone watched this episode more than once one after the other?
beautiful
gotta admit, Conan is fearless
I was so happy when he gave Sean such praise for his interviewing skills. I bet Sean was glowing. Such a compliment from an absolute legend!
I respect this man immensely. My fave comedian of all time.
never seen anyone go crazy with Da bomb like that lol
He’s sipped the sauce that’s a first
This is legendary.
Best episode ever. hands down.
Conan must have poured wax in his mouth to protect himself from the hot sauce.
This is the greatest television ever produced
Best interview and Conan being a surprise as a beast at the spice.
This guy is gonna make so many memes and instantly reusable green screen bits.
Love Conan but this was over the top. Almost felt like he was threatened by Sean so he had to out duel him. Wish he could have just been himself and allowed Sean to do his thing. Maybe we get to learn a bit more about Conan and things we didn't already know. This is what Sean is great at.
Conan never fails to deliver! That was epic w a great host as well!
Conan was my hero. Now, Conan will _always_ be my hero.     God bless America; God bless Cocoa O’Brien.
Comedic genius!
This is one of the absolute top episodes. Just absolutely hilarious, and I kinda get the idea that he might not have been 100% truthful about his experience with spicy food.
19:28 hey look a ghost probably.
Oh... this is gonna be a good one. Was and will allways be a Conan fan.
This was truly a one of a kind episode. Nothing will ever come close.
This has been my favorite episode 😂😂😂
Easily one of the funniest men on earth. I love Conan!  Didnt even know he had a show on Max. Will be watching it tonight
Conan was nuts!  What an ending to the season!
Conan is that guy!!!
Peak entertainment.
And scene
You have had some really fun episodes.  I wonder how you could top some of them.  Conan figured it out lol.
I’ve had da bomb it’s pretty hot
Conan O'Brien is my spirit animal
I used to think Conan o Brien was a bit gimmicky. That was a long time ago. Now Conan O'Brien needs a friend is the first thing on my way home every day. He is genuinely one of the best comedians out there.
That may have been the best episode of all time!!!  😺😺😺
This was set up because the last dab is way thicker than that.. You can't drink The last dab like water. You would literally have to put it over your mouth and shake it for some to come out. This was definitely set up. But it was funny AF.
Conan killed it
Conan is a legend 😄
Finally.. my hero. hahaha. How will you top the next episode now?
This is a man with no perceived dignity.
That look.  22:36 Ok guys, call an ambulance.
I don't even have to watch this episode to know that this is going to be good.
Conan channeled the spirit of Regis Philbin there
NO ONE is more committed to the bit than Conan! 🙌 😂 He is a legend. So freaking funny and you know he’s just dying inside but still dedicated to getting the laughs. Hands down the most entertaining Hot Ones. ❤
He rolled in and showed everyone what show business is all about. What a king.
Cameraman Bill catching Da Bomb dribbling onto the table is the MVP
All the craziness aside, respect to Conan's spice game.
Seriously though. What a master.
Slow clap.....
This had me dying . Conan is such a legend 👏
Conan is the GOAT. In every. Single. Way.
I don’t comment on YouTube ever. But Conan deserves one for that performance. Truly moving.
That was a masterpiece.
This was such a weird episode. I love Conan, one of the funniest celebs of all times. This episode had a vibe like no other episode. It both felt right and wrong.
Legend has been named😊
This is absolute GOLD!
conan proving he's the goat
God I love Conan
Forgot how much I loved Conan as host, when he slobbered that last wing with the Last Dab and sipped that sauce is why he’s the best in late night 😂😂😂
What is the opposite of brain freeze? Can we just call it "Brain O'Brian"?
What is the opposite of brain freeze? Can we just call it "Brain O'Brian"?
Bill Burr, Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Conan O’Brien…all clinically insane
I. LAUGHED. OUT. LOUD. FOR. FIVE. MINUTES. STRAIGHT. THANK. YOU.
Unhinged
I wouldn't have expected any less from Conan
Conan is effing wild hahahahahahah
Wow! Just...wow! A sentence that I never thought I (or anyone) would utter but: On this Hot Ones episode, Conan O'Brien has proven himself a god, who walks among mere mortals.
Never a fan of Conan's comedy. But I admire his hard work. Sean totally 'lost' the show to Conan.
This is probably the funniest episode of the series.
Maybe my favorite episode ever...
This maybe the funniest episode ever...
He is obnoxious
Dr. Arroyo reminds me of Dr. Nick Rivera....Hello Everybody!
I haven't laughed that hard in years. One of the greats of all time
Not gonna lie, this would have been the perfect way for Conan to die. The tragedy of it though would be they probably wouldn't have aired the episode :(
What’s wrong with me why can’t I feel???????
This is the best episode ever!
he was so real about being irish 😂😭
Conan left it all out there 😅
This has become my favorite  episode  just beating the joey Diaz one
I just love Conan. He just tickles pickles
"What's wrong with you people? You don't know what real danger looks like anymore." I think he just called it as far as closing out the show for good... I mean if Conan got 5 million views in 3 days compared to the nobody-hasn't-a-clue-who-you-are celebritards, I don't think you can find anyone else to guest star as good as him.
This happened
Conan is just the absolute best, magic episode
MAn, no way those were original da bomb and x pepper.....Conan would die 😅 Was awesome anyway))) love it!)
" CALL THE WIFE " .... that killed me 😂
I vote you bring 1 out of 3 people:  1. Kurt Angle  2. Uncle Roger (Haiyaaa)  3. Matpat
bro he's actually insane --
Not even Conan is completely invulnerable to Da Bomb.
😂😂😂
The legend.
best ending ever lol
"You're a great interviewer."  Coming from Conan O'Brien, that's incredibly high praise.
What a season ender!
Late Night got me through all nighters and many late nights in high school and college. Best interviewer out there.
Anyone else get Master Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force vibes while he was ranting
17:17 Is Conan a god or something? He turned water into milk.
Conan's handling of Dab X was superhuman.
This is perfect for his Eulogy
'm glad Dr. Arroyo was there to make sure everyone was ok. I liked the cut of his jib. Conan was great too.
I just spit out some of my drink when Doctor Orroyo used the stethoscope on Sean's tongue. hahaha
I'm shocked lol
Best Hot Ones ever! I’m a huge Conan fan and supporter since I was a kid. Loved seeing him in this interview format!
Dam Conan went beast mode at the end there
You know that scene in Wolf of Wall Street where Matthew McConaughey totally upstages Leonardo DiCaprio for 6 minutes? Yeah this is the TV interview version of that.
this was nuts!
This is the best hot ones ever.
Best Guest EVER!! Number 1 - This man is immortal… unbelievable😮
This was amazing. Irish American emotional repression put to good comedic use.
Dude conans the best. A true og
Olfactory, gustatory deficits suggestive Long Covid!
Wow. This is pure gold. What a king of a man.
I've never seen this show before. I never will see it again. This is everything I need to see.
Conan is the GOAT
That was by far the funniest episode ever. Oh my god.
imaging a like,. WHAT IF, Hot Ones.. for instance; STEVE IRWIN. Man the idea
He's always been nuts 😭
Conan made history here
im scared 😭
Conan O'Brien is the funniest man alive. That was... that was f*cking gold.
Best episode ever
I ❤ Conan
Conan is a world treasure!
That was pure insanity
conan is such  a g
Wish he brought Jordan with him and made him eat Da Bomb and took the credit for it.
Man is a complete unit.
Conan is the talk show GOAT
Disturbing. Trainwreck.
Insane, insane, insane! LOVE his Passion!!! He got me into mixed emotions at the end!
It's like a charlie Chaplin rant at the end LOL
He shoved some serious stuff in his pockets. He's going to agravate that hematoma.
The water buffalo incident is on youtube if you want to see it. He isn't lying about the big bruise.
I loved it when CONAN went to Finland, my mother's homeland!  He is cool people with me!  From this Finnish American Writer in Boston!  KIPPIS!  :D  - Markus McLaughlin, Boston
Conan can handle the heat!!!
“Is this bit to you??” 😂😂😂
Best guest ever. Conan is a legend
Now I need Conan on Last Meals.
He’s REALLY gonna be sorry tomorrow 🚽
This is absolutely brilliant
Its the first time I heard Conan swear lol
Okay, I tossed my cookies...😂
Conan is so funny. Cant wait for his show on Max, HBO Max.
Conan is great as always.  Perhaps he's bipolar or a bit depressed or something (opinion), but when it comes to show business he always nails it out of the park in spectacular fashion.
epic, never seen anyone all in like this, no fear, a legend has been born.
<3
Elon wants to go to Mars. Conan arrived here from Mars. Maybe they should talk. Please record that conversation.
The fact Conan came on here and blessed you with what is going to be your most watch episode. He showed you so much love. To see you smile like that much deserved brother. Super happy for you ! Thank you Conan !
I love you Conan. Unreal.
Dam, standing ovation!!!!
I haven't laughed this hard during a hot ones!!
The Best Show Ever!  The Best Guest Ever!  This beats Cooliio!
K, conan  owned it. I’ve had da bomb and it is pure terror. Respect.
David Goggins next please, we need to see him break!
Conan is the Final Boss in hard mode.
Needs more Sona laughing at Conans endeavor
GOAT 🐐 OF LATE NIGHT FOREVER
Well…this was the best episode I’ve ever watched.
I can't tell if this is a conan skit or a hot ones interview lol
Hollywood upstairs medical college
Love Conan
That's some big Leroy Jenkins energy. GOAT.
I bet if they had asked him to do a line of coke and a tequila suicide, he wouldn't even have blinked and done it as well lol
moved me to tears FRRRR
It’s rare I laugh out loud for any show, movie or podcast.. this one had me giggling all the way through. 😂
Major Denis Reynolds vibes.
Conan for the win🏆😂😂
Hands down the best episode of any season!
Conan is the GOAT!
I met Conan once in Boston 2021. What a standup human being. I know you can't always base what someone is like after a brief moment with them, but Conan was and is the real deal.   Love the segment! Conan has this magnetic energy of both respect and kindness, but also a witty and fun attitude. Couldn't ask for someone better.
*slow clap* that's real dedication to showmanship. I can't really tell he feels anything without the red face and drooling
Absolute best show ever - I laughed with tears.  Love you Conan!
Conan is a national treasure... I'm in tears!
Conan never disappoints, always funny.
Conan   always at 100%.
This episode gave me an asthma attack from laughing so hard. Great show!!!!
Hey, Conan O'Brian, is Haiti great already?
Oh my god
Man, one of the best ever!
"I'm not in danger, I am the danger" energy
Bring in Danhausen for an episode.
The first Hot Ones featuring Sean.
Conan destroyed them sauces! Best Hot Ones episode by far! Conan is king!
He’s legit savage
The laughs were incredible for this one. Just insanely hilarious.
I pressed the like button before I even started watching. So excited this episode is finally here!
Conan is the GOAT
There's comedy in the Koran?
This is the only guest that was more entertaining than Eric Andre.
I'd give up half way into that.. Props to Conan for the detication😂
Bow down to your king!  Conan is a legend!
Best guest ever! 😂
pure irish insanity! why weren't the sauces on potatoes?? racist drivel.
Conan was giving off the energy of one of the Russian Roulette scenes in The Deer Hunter. I feared for Sean's life and I'm glad he and his jacket made it out of there alive.
This man is a legend
A legend recognizing a legend.
I wanna see Nardwuar on here
What a psychotic legend. Cranked it to 11 early n kept it up.
absolutely amazing. What a guy
wth is wrong with him?
YOU SHOULD HAVE GRUPO FRONTERA!!
I have not laughed this hard at a YouTube video, ever.
Man I’ve always loved Conan. My ginga! And he killed this!
Beast Mode!
The episode I’ve waited years for! 😄
Wow the king!!! No one else can beat this!😊
The last two minutes were so Lewis Black. Conan can do anything.
I loved the exchange with "The Doctor" :  "Did you even graduate?" "Well, it was supposed to be 4 years.......". That is smart, clever comedy. Whoever the Doctor is, he's brilliant.
Conan is definitely winning Hot Ones award!!!
Legend
Conan's the best
lol! So good!
Conan knows exactly the perfect chemistry to be a late night host, he just gets it. Genuinely hope he gets the praise and love he deserves
Wow this insane lol
Conan is just different animal. Legend
I've never seen anything like this.....
Conan’s lips are we’re getting swollen
Conan is the Wing KinG 🤴
I have loved Conan’s over the top personality for decades. This was Fing hilarious. Handled those wings like a savage.
Dr. Arroyo needs his own episode next season.
Ive been watchng conan for 15 years, always puts the biggest smile on my face! HISTERYCAL 😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂
CONAN makes life fun!
The best and funniest of all time
If you forgot, Conan's a legend. This is just an example.
LOL. Conan is awesome.
Honestly super impressed by how well he took those hot sauce. I mean he turned red, but hes not sweating as bad or is as red as I was expecting him to be.  Also he was sipping the hot sauce and ate so much more of the last dab too. Hes still able to pretty much maintain his composure. I mean hes able to still focus on being funny than breaking that, " character" and talk about how spicy it is. Even the way he kinda lost it is just part of his bit, hes syill able to immediately answer question calmly. Im not sure if hes anle to take spicy food well, or all that hot sauce just gave him an adrenaline rush or something.
He did death of a salesman.  Read, watch that one!  BEST HOT ONES SO FAR ❤
this may be my new all time favorite episode
How long did Conan spend in the toilet after this blowing it out?  So much pain for a laugh.
Legend
what a great guest
Conan the goat
ConeBone69 yeee
The host of this show is honestly not made for this line of work. His personality isn't made for TV, more like an accountant or a school teacher
Get Hilary Hahn on the show! Challenge her to play after the wings even 😈
CONAN CONAN CONAN😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂
“Was it a 4 year medical school?” “Uh, it was supposed to be.”  This is gold 😂😂😂
theyre gonna have to like end the show because idk how therye gonna top this episode
Almost 35k comments! Thats crazy!
Conan is the GOAT Of GOATS!
you guys should do Kanye West lol I want to see that chaos!
Conan absolutely blew this away. Almost kind of shined a light on what it would’ve been like to have Chris Farley on the show. Truly amazing
Best episode ever!
What a mountain of a man
😂😂😂😂 this is maybe the Funniest episode ever
This man is pure will
I'm hungry for wings now.
I love Conan. But this was hard to watch. Surprisingly annoying, and so over the top
Sean looks almost worried at the end there lol
I wonder how much of Conan (the brand) is involved in these antics vs how much Conan (the man, the comedian) is involved. He came in with props and an actual irl doctor! Whether one is more involved than the other, Conan is the epitome of comedy and entertainment; I love him!
5th time watching this….. conan is top human in my opinion
Definitely the best episode
Conan is an absolute force of nature
Conan is THE man. 😎
Best, one, ever
I'm not crying your crying! Absolute stunning performance by a LEGEND in comedy, thank you Conan
Best episode ever.
This was the one I didn’t know I REALLY needed to see 😂❤🎉 Bravo Conan.  Bravo👏
Sean looks scared for his life
Some of the best content too grace YT and ive been here since the dawn of it.
Mistaking Gandhi for Popeye as his hero was hilarious!! 🤣
Best guest ever 100%
Best Hot Ones EVER!!!
23:50 😭😭😭
My intestines are bleeding for Conan! What a beast!
Legend.
Best one yet! 😂😂😂
What I would do to see eminem on this show
😂😂😂😂 i couldn’t look at his mouth towards the end 😂😂😂😂
Steve O is watching this with his eyes bulged out. Even the Undertaker has his mouth open in awe. Unless Conan pulled a Homer Simpson and coated his mouth with wax I have no idea how he did this. His dry cleaner is going to have burns from cleaning his clothes. He is now King of the Gingers!
He handled that so well I'm suspicious. If this was legit, he really mastered turning pain energy into screaming comedy.
He's taking the half eaten wings with him so NBC doesn't clone him.
Classic Conan, this is why he's the champ. He embraces this wholeheartedly.
best interview on hot ones ever
the definition of worth the wait
This one is so good. My God.... Long live Conan!!!!
wow. way to leave sanity at the door >.<  the man was planning to go hard, went after it, then proceeded to glow red and leak fluids all over.... it was fantastic, but i hope he's ok.
0:50 to 23:01 shows the sheer escalation of this episode
HE IS AN INTERNATIONAL TREASURE❤
I love Conan!!!! He is a true entertainer...and smart! i forgot how much i loved him.
I'll def watch his show on Max 😆
Who was the guest?😅
Please tell me someone has checked on Chris Farley, oh I mean Conan!  Classic - one of the best!
Conan is the Goatest Goat to ever Goat.
Just learned i share a birthday with Conan. How did i not know this after watching him for years? lol
Monorail
Okay so I watched this and thought it was legendary but then I rewatched it…so everytime his fake doctor hands him a bottle that means it’s a fake hot sauce. And I think Conan justifies that by really dialing up his performance. But he’s not actually playing by the rules I don’t think he actually did da bomb. I love Conan but I feel like people might be led to think this is real just because he gets really over the top. This is old school show business, there’s nothing genuine going on here
this is the best thing ever
Incredible ending. Comedy gold.
The best one ever !!! Richard Pryor is to coke as chapelle is to butts as Conan is to hot sauce
Wait I share a birthday with Conan?! That’s awesome how did I never know that
I lived to watch conan's "in the year 2000s" which later became "in the year 3000s" back early 2000s
Conan ain't skeert of no hot wings.😅 Thanks for the interview. 😅
8:10 the worst thing a guest can say
I did not realize Conan Obrien is so tall!! 😮
I hope I remain this cognizant under pressure in my 60s!!!
Best. Episode. Ever.
M motivated.....🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Straight up man. Best episode so far. Absolutely fantastic guest.
Pure comic genius
Never see Conan this serious before..
Conan...WOW!
CONAN MURDERED THIS CHALLENGE hahahah  Bravo!!!  God bless his Bumhole
Conan is the man!
BEST EVER!! 😂
Probably…. The Best guest ever.  Conan O’brien, you are an awesome entertainer!  This coming from a 42 year old that has NEVER watched a full episode of anything you have been in!  Sean Evans…best interviewer on this planet. Period!
Shia has nothing on Conan!
I mean…You can’t top this.
Conan and Gordon Ramsey are on the opposite ends of the hot ones spectrum
wish I could have watched the last few minutes without gagging lol I just could not looks at his mouth
Legend just being legendary
This is what happens when you try and host a talk show and the guest is the MASTER talk show host. Encore Mr. O'Brien. Encore to you sir.
If I ever met Conan (I’ve been a fan since ‘99 in middle school) I’d just pretend I didn’t know who he was and roast him.
I base my comedy style in my own small world by watching this man do it exceptionally and he does it amazingly till this day. Love the dynamic with Sean too. Pure madness hahaha
Conan literally had me dying laughing He's a freaking legend One of the greatest hot ones episodes ever to exist hands down!! 🎉
Conan is the goat always!!!
Conan DOMINATED the wings! This was a sight to see!
Epic.
I always really like Conan but this was on another level.  Amazing
Think this is the second time I've seen Sean be the guest on his own show.
god he's an  animal
Conan is a wildcard 😂
The best episode but Mr. Evans looks under the weather.
I was hoping for Andy Barker, er, I mean Richter. The real person behind the show.
The absolute best episode of all time! Conan!!!!💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This has to be the best one. Conan absolutely killed it
Last episode u lied then.   U told Shakira it was the last episode.  Mmmmm lied
Irish and grew up with flavorless food? That doesn't even make sense... Irish food is tons of flavor bro. TONS
THE GOAT
Conan!!!!!!!! Had to watch!!!
Awh that is so Amazing ... to hear from Conan .. he is SUCH a GENUINE soul and true comedian and one who is a deferral of things with humour too and he didn't differ to anything there while praising you ...  he meant that and he is right for sure... really great!
Insanity…
Hands down best hot ones ever.
best episode ever.
The best episode ever. Conan is the funniest man alive
CONAN IS F€°÷¥ CRAZY AND I LOOOOOOVE HIM!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dam this “Conan O’Brein “guy seems like a solid/energetic guy.   He should become a host 🫡
This is Conan's Super Saiyan form
best. guest. ever
Is Conan still alive after this episode?
How did Sean get clearance to talk to Conan?
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
This was THE best show ever, laughed my ahh off
Did Conan just demolish the wings like no other?!
I haven't laughed that hard in a while. True legend. I might have even sharted a bit? Conan officially broke hot ones!
Gosh, I absolutely love Conan. Grew up watching clips from his show on YouTube for sure
This is my favourite ep EVER. Conan crushed it
This is the most Irish-American thing I've ever seen.
This was incredible.
Best episode 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 🤣🤣
Best episode ever
Best episode EVAAA
What a champ
I'm crying this was so funny
Absolute LEGEND.
Sean matches his guest’s sauce application typically. I can’t imagine him even TRYING to keep up with Conan! Has he had another guest with this type of commitment in the history of Hot Ones? Impossible! Well done Conan!
He's so high on hot sauce 😂
Best episode ever
Good thing this is a season finale cause I would feel bad for anyone who had to follow this. Conan is officially the Hot Ones GOAT!!!
Amazing 😂
Now we just need Keith Morrison next season
👑🥇🏆
That water buffalo's head is actually on Conan's wall in his library office.
He doesn't do drugs 😂
Conan's still got it.
Nah bro is different
Conan 😂 Jesus he's losing it. Da Bomb set him off.
power over spice is power over all
the hot wings version of the joker
Best episode to date!!!!!!
Conan really turned into Lewis Black at the end there.
This was incredible
He’s built for this lol that was fantastic
I'm not a fan of conans humor, but serious props to how he handled the wings and the total commitment to the bit
I lost hit when he started taking gulps of the bottles. Guy just dominated it.
Shows over Conan won
THE BEST EPISODE OF HOT ONES YET!!!! leave it up to Conan!!!!
Conan is king
genius
Jesus is God's Son.  Jesus was crucified and died for the sins of the forgiveness of sins.  Jesus was raised from the dead by God.  Jesus is Lord.
Finally! Thank you Conan, you really are the number one forever. ❤
Best episode ever.
This was somewhere between gross, impressive and funny. The end was mostly gross and a bit extra😅
We just witnessed the birth of the expression "to jacket one's wings"
Best episode ever, by far!!
For those who don't know: The late-night TV interviewer who famously said "It's not going very well, is it?" to a guest was David Letterman. He said this to Madonna during an interview on "The Late Show with David Letterman" in 1994.
This was SO unhinged.  I thought I was going to die from laughing.
Nah... Conan is a mad lad alian
Genious
Seriously, Conan is great! Not enough credit. Conan and Norm is unbeatable ❤️
Conan O'Brien is the MOST mentally stable unstable person in the world. He is truly a national treasure we must protect at all cost's
great set of hair
The funniest hot ones so far. What a legend 😄
Conan is the fking man bro lol. He gets his flowers every time 💐
For me this is the best interview on Hot Ones ever.
this is unquestionably the best episode.... jesus... just chaos
conan4president
Legend. Who else can come on a show as good as this and elevate it? Conan might be the greatest to ever do it.
Thanks
Great episode! Love Conan. You need to get Caitlin Clark on sometime soon too!!!
This episode will be on my top 3 hot ones episode so far 😂🤣😆😂🤣😆😂🤣😆
One of the best ever!!!
Conan is anazing
24:00 Conan channeling Faulkner here.
Best hot ones episode ever. I literally laughed for 27 mins straight. Love coco
GOAT 🐐
I hope this episode gets the most views of all time! 😂 Conan is the GOAT!
Amazing 😂
Conan the GOAT
This was hilarious and second only to the guy who put the sauce directly in his eye.
Lowkey, reminds me of Sketch.
greatest hot onea video ever but i still end up distracted by the ill-fitting music. doesn't match the vibe at all
He eat most spicy sauce in the world, while never breaking character. What a legend!!!
Never in my life............
…can you even keep doing the show after this? I mean, this is like series finale level stuff right here. Best episode yet!
If a 61 year old can do it whys everyone else so bad
Great energy! lolol
Conan O'Brien👏🏼👏🏼 the goat🫡
That image of Conan spilling the best knowledge ever, dying from capsaicin, bottles spilling everywhere is my favorite thing ever! 🥰
HANDS DOWN GREATEST HOTWINGS!
Did we just watch Conan O’Brien die? He better be okay! He’s an absolute legend that needs to be saved at all cost. Conan, you won Hot Ones!!! Now please no more heart attack inducing shows.
This has to be the funniest one I’ve seen so far
This is my favorite episode
Conan is a top 10 human
I think I cried laughing more on this one than I would have if I'd eaten the wings.... amazing
He’s the king of hot ones NOW!!!!
God I love Conan so much!!! 😂😂😂
Dude I love Conan. He was the only one to get my humor. S/O Max W
That was an heroic & epic effort by Conan; truly amazing!  It was a great interview, too!
"America’s present need is not heroics, but healing; not nostrums, but normalcy; not revolution, but restoration; not agitation, but adjustment; not surgery, but serenity; not the dramatic, but the dispassionate..."  - Warren G Harding
That was crazy. I was waiting for da bomb to take him.. and he took it!
Best. Episode. To. Date.
The best hot ones I've ever seen. 😂
Conan has no friends, and apparently no buds of the taste type.  Was he injected with Novocain prior to the interview?  I would've been hospitalized.  Great show!
Poor guy when he tried the Bomb 🤣🤣
I love that Conan and I have the same bday
This is the best thing ever.
15:02 to about 15:17 is kind of profound. Not really, just kind of.
The greatest episode of Hot Ones to ever be filmed!
Okay, he has my respect for going wild on those wings. It's always frustrating when some of the guests take mouse bites.
Absolutely insane! I love it! Conan nailed this one!
The Joey Diaz episode was my favorite..until now.
This has got to be the best episode, yet!
BEST EPISODE OF HOT ONES EVER & IT"S NOT EVEN CLOSE!!! "CONAN O'BRIEN IS A HOT ONES LEGEND"
New sub thanks to this episode! Fantastic interview! Bravo! Bravo!
wow
I think Conan needs an intervention.
Conan said no one will be laughing AT him, they will be laughing WITH him
Conan the freakin 🐐 !
F……g amazing! Well done Mr O’Brien.
No you didn't grow up in an Irish house. Boston is on the other side of the planet. You are American.
I love Conan O'Brien so much.  Absolute Legend
We need to see the aftermath of this! 😂
Wow! Conan is a beast!!!
If you're short on time and want a quick idea of what Conan brings to the table, go to 21:00 and just let it run for 15-20 seconds
Maybe I'm alone in this, but this is probably my least favorite episode of Hot Ones ever.  I found Conan to be incredibly disrespectful for basically the entire show.  He stomped all over the format and denigrated the entire premise, and then turned around and said he hated it when guests say that a show isn't going well.  And maybe that's just part of the joke, but intentionally being a hypocrite isn't automatically funny.  I do appreciate him saying that he had a lot of respect for Sean, and clearly he meant it, but like...if you respect someone, don't steal their show from them.  I guess I'm glad people liked it, but this is way outside of what I've come to enjoy about this show.
Long time fan of Conan 😂 never lets me down
Conan was soooo gracious to make this interview an epic episode. I mean 3.2 million views in 3days. God bless you Conan.
Conan O'Brien is a national treasure
lol this is like Conan when the shrooms start kicking in.
Best episode ever.
I've been a Conan fan for years, but to have that kind of energy at 61 and plow through infernally hot sauce like that is stunning... what a guy, one of a kind.
Now this one is the ticket! Conan eats his wings like a wild, ravenous, feral hyena… i think he really got like LSD trippy there at the end. COMEDY GOLD! hahahahaha I was scared that he would touch his eyes just for laughs. 😅 He really took over the interview w such ease.   Modern medicine needs to study this man’s virility and stamina. Protect him at all costs. he’s a gem.
just had da bomb myself for the first time today and was kind of underwhelmed by the spice and taste alike. spicy sure but nothing compared to a real hotpot
Bravo
Painkillers
He’s so hilarious. 😂
Conan is my faveeeee late night host!
I just HAVE to know how that bathroom break was after
I think this was the best thing I have ever seen on the internet! ❤
The comment about TheThree Stooges remark  😂. No spices until he was 51? Is Conan the G.O.A.T. of Hot Ones ? He's got my vote !
This was sooooo funny:)
Here yee here yee here before u the  honorable conan o'bryan all rise.🍗🦴🔥🌋🎉✨️🧨🏆🎖🏅🥇🥈🥉👑🔊🎤⬇️
best episode ever
I haven't watched that much Conan so I had NO IDEA how unhinged he was lol
Im not exaggerating at all when I say drinking hot sauce, especially over 600,000 scoville units is completely insane. I have eaten the hottest things you can imagine, but the real pain is the next day when you have large amounts of hot sauce without food. He absolutely suffered unimaginable pain the next day.
That was actually insane
One of the best guests on this show
Now that's entertainment!!
❤ well...he is a genious
Conan you animal 🙌🙌🙌🙌
“Can I keep these?” Ded already.
Conan is the master host lol, amazing. Hahahahah
No words. Just genius.
This was pretty funny. He has an office in the desert is an underrated joke. ❤
Legendary!
The “IM FINE” on the last dab/wing is going to be the best gif 😂😂😂 I can’t wait lol this was so unhinged and brilliant haha
Conan should have been the primary face of late night TV - it's not even close.
easily your best episode
This was one of the best season endings ever. Conan is an absolute legend with interviewing and being interviewed.
Oh my god I can already see gifs now of the “IM FINE, IM PERFECTLY F*CKING FINE” on the last dab/wing hahaha 😂 the best
The laughs built just like the heat in this one!
Love how Dr. Arroyo is legit a Simpsons character 😂 Conan Rules!
That’s passion defined
This made me sweat watching this
This has to be the funniest episode I've seen
love it, he is a living legend! best guy you had on the show!
This is the most unhinged thing I've seen in a long time. And I am HERE for it. Conan is the best.
Conan's the 🐐
Insane and I LOVED it
I love Conan so much. The most unhinged guest ever to be on Hot Ones, and possibly the most unhinged guest ever. 👏🏾 😂😂😂😂
Jjj
WHAT. A. GOD.  What an absolute unit. Just not enough words to descrive this legend.
Conan has never been funny. Relies in writers.
Hahahaha good old conan... thanks for good laughs!
Maniac
What a savage 😂
Never watched one of these. Conan made me laugh to tears. Thank you to everyone involved in making this happen. Peace Love Happiness
I will watch anything with Conan in it.
What a funny, hip, relevant fellow. I may check out his show, but I cant seem to remember the name of the platform its on. I know its not TV...
Conan is AWESOME!!!
Conan is the hero we need to not the one we deserve.
oh boy
i luv this man
This was amazing.
Cant believe after watching Hot ones for so many years it just put out its best episode
Back when the Simpsons were in their prime Conan wrote some of the funniest episodes for it
Excellent!  Conan in his spring loaded element.  Can't get any better than this.
This was easily one of the best and funniest Hot Ones in a long time, let alone ever.
thats why hes the GOAT, THE GOAT
Conan is Godly.
why do so many guest have the sauce on their face, chicken in their mouth. I get its hot but WIPE YOUR **** MOUTH AND FACE. thank you
The greatest hot ones episode of all time.
I would never want to have a conversation with Conan. Dude is off his rocker.
One of the greatest ever
Conan just made stone cold look like a dweeb
Man, is this the BEST episode EVER or what? 🍗🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🍗
Well, that was everything I was hoping for and expected 😂
2:07 Conan, "I dont fear your wings"  then 22:31 Conan goes off the deep end!
he looks like if Bill Burr and Bryan Cranston had a baby
Did Conan drink a candle full of wax before doing this? Good lord what a mad man.
As one of the people requesting Conan for years... Thank you so much for making this happen, Hot Ones team. To watch Conan's distilled personality power through these 30min is pure gold!
The dude got the original Homer Simpson progressively losing his marbles energy. 😂 21:56
Conan was by far the best guest
one of the best guests and best episodes.
He is gonna destroy some poor toilet after this
This is the single greatest episode of hot ones ever  …. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
His face drastically changed colors.
This the best Hot Ones episode to date
drinks the sauce LOL I miss Conan
Well this escalated in such a Conan way, just amazing and insane. The ending dab DOSE was ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION
Sean was NOT ready for this interview
One of the greatest episode of Hot ones, pure genius from start to finish. i love Conan's madness on this show.
"YOU PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT REAL DANGER LOOKS LIKE ANYMORE"
This was such a Rick and Morty ending 😭
Charlie Rose show where you eat hot wings 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
hahahaha, this guy is crazy!! Best one yet!!
What's wrong with your hair.  He sure is a weird looking fella.  Rmmy? What for? His hair?
He turned it into high art.
Speaking for the fans here -  If ever there needs to be a guest host and it's NOT Conan, we're rioting.
Why are you doing close ups of the biggest head and face in the world? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY??!! WE CAN SEEE EEEEEVVVRRRYHTHIIING!!!
He's the funniest man on the planet and he's insane.
Ok I must admit that this was probably the best Hot Ones show that I've ever witnessed, at least the best guest performance, hands down.  I'm super impressed tbh, good job Conan! :D
Conan has been the only guest that has totally owned the show and Sean 😂😂 He's cooked 😅
I like Conan, but...I think he tried a little too hard.
My fav ep of hot ones so far
Conan stayed ten toes down and was ice cold for the whole thing. Much respect.
Legendary episode.
I think Conan absolutely channeled Robin Wiliams here and showed how much both of them are such professionals in comedy ABOVE almost everyone else.  Being crazy is one thing, but to maintain your sense of intellect and sense of actual control even when "seeming" to be out of it, is absolute genius!
Gingers have a higher pain threshold, it's true.
This episode was over the top! Loved it!
This might be the BEST EPISODE EVER 🤣
Coolio is yelling. Don't
Conan is GOAT 🔥
R.I.P Warren G. Harding. Literally a G.
Conan is a beast of comedy. This was great.
conan o'brien is simply built different
Conan is right about Max. It will always be HBO.
I swear to god I thought this was fake…this man is absolutely insane!!! No one can top this ever….like ever!!!
Best hot ones episode hands down. Love Conan to the death.
Tip of the cap, sir...
Conan is a living legend.  He went all in on this one and I'm glad he did.
The only comedian that can make me laugh no matter what. 😂
Conan is incredible
a master at suffering. my full respect.
Gingers DO have a soul ❤
you can tell Sean was kind of starstruck ,never really seen him like this.
Finally a bit of personality with showmanship lolll
Best episode so far....”c’mon man are we doing this or not!”
Mad that Sean Evans name means John in Irish then John in Welsh ,  So he'd be John John
Have always thought Conan is so legit funniest people alive!
He seems to be having so much fun now, all of his shows and podcasts are just him, happy for him. Drinking those sauces is crazy though 😂
Is it just me or does the background music kinda ruin the show? I saw some past episodes and there was no cheesy background music then. The music simply does not fit the interview at all. It is making it feel like some dramatic drama show, rather than a simple, fun interview show!
Conando!!
Literally the best episode ever
This guy is truly a inspiration <3 Thanks Conan
Bro just put every previous guest to shame and set an impossible bar for all future guests
The best late night host in late night show history.
That background music is horribly bad. I couldn't even focus on the dialogues.
I feel the wisdom of god watching this
No one will ever top this like CONAN
16:53 😆Gawd, I looove Conan!😄
Conan is the HANDS DOWN best late night host!! The man was born to entertain! He's awesome! Id watch him on anything, including some hot wings YouTube show. lol
there is reason why he is the greatest of all time ❤❤❤ team coco forever ♾️
Conan is my favorite tv host
Epic drinking over 1 million scoville like a champ.
I just picture him going home, hanging up his jacket, then 3 weeks later losing his MIND trying to find out where the GAWD awful smell wafting through his house is coming from 🤯🤣🍗
These two guys are both masters of their craft. This was a totally unhinged, informed, and unbelievably entertaining piece of media. Incredible.
The Conan show featuring hot ones
It would be interesting if you included your videos in Spanish (Latin American) like other YouTube channels. You will reach more people and more in Latin America. greetings!
Hahahahaha :D Conan is truly a GEM
You can't end a party without someone on the floor
The greatest guest ever!!!!!
Favorite
THE GREATEST TO EVER DO IT
I love this dude! Conan, good dude. Look high and look low.
Conan is an ICON
Conan is a living legend.
what happened to Sean matching the guests?😅😂
Absolute king! The best ever host :)
l would pay to see the full unedited interview..!
Conan's new show is premiering on his 61st birthday. "Conan O'Brien" = 61 (Reverse Reduction)
He should be inducted into the Hot Ones Hall of Fame immediately. Goated episode
This guy is the monster of the show
Conan didn't skip a beat. Best interview on hot ones in my opinion.
Classic
This is the most unhinged episode of Hot Ones yet, I was DYING of laughter
Long time Conan & Hot Ones fan, hands down one of the best episodes ever 🔥🔥🔥
I think Conan just took the crown for the greatest spice lord to ever be on the show.
What a guest😎
might be my favorite episode ever and conan has got to be top 3 most impressive with the sauces
His knowledge drop about Warren Harding while frothing with hot sauce smeared over his face was just excessive. It was like watching Michael Jordan dunk on someone. What a boss.
Why👨🏽‍🚒Conan🤯why
I love how everybody says how funny Conan is. And of course he absolutely is the funniest guy on the planet. But you know why he’s funny? Because he is well educated. Here’s a tip for all wannabe comics (and humans):  get smart. Read frequently. Learn about the world. Embrace a little diversity. Get out of your echo chamber and comfort zone. Ask questions. Be more like Conan and Ted Lasso and the rest of us will love your efforts. Peace.
This is why Conan will always be my favorite.
23:00 Wow!!! That was Incredible... Conan is Insane!!! Best Episode yet.
This is redemption for every guest who ever quit part way through.
He would be the best joker ever 😂😂 why so serious 😂😂
Conan killed bea arthur?????
I see Conan, I Watch
This is me when I first ate at my mexican gf's house
wow, he took it to another level!?
I didn’t realize How much I missed Conan till now 😂
Please get Chelsea Wolfe on the show!
This has to be the most wild episode of this show. I’m convinced this man isn’t human
Uh idk what I just watched but I think Conan just ruined Hot Ones for me.
Dr. Arroyo, he’s not the best; but “affordable!”.
Conan is amazing. The funniest natural comedian i have ever seen. Great interview!
Best. Episode. Ever.
Say what you will about Conan, dude gives it his all every time
One word: LEGENDARY!!!! I still remember staying up late to watch him back in the late 90s and in the past 25 years I have been following his career, he NEVER fails to entertain! Truly, the best at his craft!!! I still remember the telenovela he did in Spanish!
0:00 Conan annihilates a generation
That was self-immolation levels of concentration. Those sauces were locked in there with Conan.
For the love of god- please bring Conan back for more interviews in the future. You brought Gordon Ramsey several times, PLEASE bring Coco back for more episodes. ❤️❤️❤️
I bet the water buffalo incident inspired Will Forte's Buffalo bit on Conan's show
unbelievably based
Is conan now the GOAT on hotones?
EPIC! Best episode ever!
Seen every episode. Greatest. Episode. Ever.
This episode of Hot Ones with Conan is already one of the most-watched in just three days. Everyone loves Conan!
Oh my lord- that is what you call "committing to the bit". Historically knowledgeable with the ability to be intelligent, complimentary, and downright hilarious all at the same time. Brilliant. How Sean managed to keep it together throughout is beyond me. How many times he said "Oh no!" and "Oh my" with true hidden concern but played on through. Well done gentlemen.
I like how instead of the wings making him back down from the heat, they just make him more and more insane the spicier they get. This was pure entertainment from one of the funniest people ever and Sean played along perfectly
In this episode Robin Williams spirit went into Conan, got scared and ran out. Conan rocks. Love the guy.
Where did you go to school  Doctor: in 1998 But where  Doctor: out of state  You should leave now lol 😂
🎶Everybody's got a water buffalo.🎶
Conan since '96❤
This brought me back to hot ones after like 4 years
braaaaafvckingvooo
Why the two tables? Seriosly.
I'm not a fan of Conan, but this was awesome.
Okay Hot ones!! WHO is the host here??!!! LOL I'm confused by the sheer energy Conan has brought on the table. A truly memorable episode.
I love that Conan has never half-assed anything in his life this just proves it this episode will go down in hot ones history Conan is a hot ones legend
The best one. I knew it
This is why Conan is the goat
Conan ate it
This interview started off awkward and boring and then blew the doors off.  Wow! Conan just set a new standard for conquering the wings.
Conan is the MVP the GOAT of Hot Ones!!!! MVP MVP MVP MVP MVP !!!!
Never have I been so engaged in an episode than this one. Conan had my wife and I laughing, concerned, and motivated. What a journey!
What a legend. He absolutely goes for it. By far the best hot ones ever
Conan is the best! 😂
Finally!
I think what we just witnessed was the single greatest event in human history!
Amazing seeing Sean not be able to keep up with Conan.
Instantly the best episode of Hot Ones! Conan O'Brien Evans 2024!
The way he says hosting Conan O’Brien sounds like he’s gloating it to his 6th grade bully
Unpopular opinion incoming: Shawn is not a great host. He's ok. Great questions, but he has faux charisma.
you can really see why he's a star
Greatest Hot Ones ever
Conan understood what makes grate this show and multiplied by 11
Conan was really committed to the bit
Theres no way he isn't freaking out over Da'Bomb
Well i don't know how anyone is going to top that, ever.
He reached legendary status. He has no competition.
This is absolutely the best hot ones I have ever seen 😂😂
True to his word Conan was "always on". Fire.
I need an extended cut of this
That's the wildest thing I've ever seen.  Conan is king. End this show now.
Conan f**king dominated.  So impressed.  The guys just came in like Evil Ryu and just murdered every wing along with the interview.  Completely hats off.
One of the best hot ones to date 👏👏👏👏
Conan O Brien Needs a Friend is a Fantastic podcast I recommend his episodes with Jack Black and Jim Gaffigan.
Conan's face matched his hair at the end.
Conan spitting at the end looks like he just gargled some KY Jelly.
Sean Evans is the only person on the planet who thinks the pandemic is still going on.
I laughed so hard I started coughing and threw up! This was awesome!
Absolute LEGEND!
Great to know that Conan and I share a birthday! April 18th!
This man destroyed the show like a god cheers to this man
My respect for Conan has just tripled
Let's not forget this man did a boot camp with IDF soldiers in 2017. His tweet with them is still up. FREE PALESTINE!!!
Conan, a hero of comedy - impressive act
Best hot ones ever!!! Love you Conan!!!
Conan is HIM!  Love Conan!
Consumate professional, and the definition of dedication.
best.guest.ever.
"Here we are in Finlands largest city..." Was the best I got on the spot
Amazing 😂 love him
Conan is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you Conan! I was reduced to tears at the end - completely lost it when he suggested we find humor in Canterbury Tales and that his intestines were reduced to ashes...
Conan OWEND THE SHOW
This was very Robin Williams-esque for me. I was laughing and I was scared.
The BOSS as left the building...ladies and gentlemen...go home...ITS OVER.
God, I love Conan
Need to get the Grand Tour crew or at least Jeremy Clarkson with their adventures coming to an end soon.
Am I the only one who noticed that his tie is fake in the thumbnail?
Ummm, best wingasode ever maybe probably indefinitely?!! Get this man his Star on the boulevard already. I bet my great great great grandkids will be watching this one
His face turning bright red with the last one was insane
We love you Conan!
From Listening with Interest to Laughing, to Burying my face in my palms to save my eyes and psyche from trauma. Then Jumping out of my chair with fantom-self-preservation and then Disgust, then Horror and then LAUGH  again... Now that's a TRIP.   P.S.: Has anybody seen Conan alive after this? :)  It was a great show, I just hope you're ok :)
Conan O’Brien is the best there is. ❤
can u have john steward
Greatest episode EVER! Conan is pure entertainment. ❤
Conan was 100 percent invested in this show and played it like a pro to the very end!! 🫡
Not even Steve-O and Shaq combined could make me laugh this hard and they’re both hilarious😂
Truly a masterpiece
Topped Steve-O and Gordon Ramsay, period !
Conan was either possed by Robin williams or Maybe Robin williams also loved hot sauce In between smart and dumb....
I’m sitting here dying. 😅. Conan is a beast!
Not gonna lie Conan is insane when it comes to skits or IRL experiences, the absolute goat that the TV will probably never get again
I know it’s been a few days did anyone check on Conan to make sure he’s alive?
This is the best, EVER!
I never would Have thought Conan would out crazy Steve-O
I've never laughed this hard or this often during an episode of this show. Best guest this show may ever have! Absolutely brilliant!!!
I ❤ Conan!
Instant top 5
Best guest yet 🔥 !! Crazy how Jordan wasn’t mentioned 😭
SEAN YOU’VE OUTDONE THE FINALE this year BEST EPISODE TO DATE
It’s been so long since I’ve laughed that hard. Love Conan!!
Conan is the best interviewer, and somehow he's also the best guest. Legend.
Badass of the year award goes to....................Hands down Conan !!  Much Respect
Best episode ever by a mile
Conan's the absolute GOAT. 😂😂
I wonder how Conan's stomach was after this show. Amazing he made it through all those sauces! What a showman!
Anyone else leaking milk 🥛 like that can’t pull it off like CONAN
Team CoCo!!! Let's go!!!
I loved the part near the end where Conan starts ranting and sounds just like Master Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
That was amazing. What a legend.
I hope he’ll survive the night…
He handled the spice so well and brought the funniest interveiw ive ever seen.
When I was younger I would sometimes catch his talk show on at night and found him pretty entertaining but I was young and never interested in sitting down and watching the full show. Now I regret not being able to experience it while it was airing.
might be the most legendary episode
ACTUAL PRO
I mean this sincerely. I love Conan as one of the greatest entertainers of our time ❤🫡😂🙏🏾
Conan looks good. I've never seen him with so much color in his face.
Ok
How's Jimmy gonna compare to that😂no diff
Easily a memorable episode, Conan is crazy, he is funny, he is smart. Great episode once again, it seemed Sean was the guest in this interview. Great promo for Conan, great episode in the books for Hot Ones.
10 mil views ez for this one
This is the best one I've seen imo
Imagine being sensitive to spicy foods but still go on the show.
Conan is a legend, sheer comedic class, fair play to Sean for trying to keep it together, Best Hot ones yet!!!!
Best Episode TO DATE 📅
Legend
This is the best episode yet! Conan the 🐐
WHAT IS HE DOING!?@?!@??@!?@
What even is this. I think this might be the greatest thing I’ve ever seen? 😂
My god, Conan is super funny, love him!
Conan's the BEAST
At 13:59, "So, my question to you...." The turning point of the interview where Conan turns the table and gets aggressive!
Conan's last dab sauce looked very watery to me. I own several and they are all almost like pastes. Sus.
I’d love to see Conan play the joker 😂
10:40 legendary animation 😂❤
LEGENDARY
Amazing
perfect guest
Savage !,
It’s like he’s not even on hot ones 😂 he’s just chatting
Best episode
So sinister how he hides the wings to do toxicology later.
Officially the best episode ever! 😳🤣🤯
"you have four more years to live, tops" and i actually died LUL
Freaking legend.
I never seen Sean so perplexed
This is the funniest episode I've ever seen so far. I had no clue how hilarious Conan was, I kinda wish I was around when he had his show. I definetly need to give his HB...his MAX show a watch
If you don’t like Conan ,   you don’t like laughing
My GOAT
How is this man 60, I hope to have this much energy.
Imagine Conan and Schlansky at a hot sauce tasting.
In the 90s Connon is just someone happens to be on the tv but on hindsight he is the best of all !  *p.s This is the first time I come across your show but you have Connon on ! Subscribed!
i remeber watching connan as a kid on a 13 inch television with rabbit ears. and he is still a legend on a 77 inch oled.
CONAN BECAME MY HERO
Conan is such a funny person and a true beast. I liked the face color change after da bomb.
Best episode
First time really seeing Conan wow he’s intelligent witty and definitely in control of his own emotions
This will never be topped.
conan finally "feeling" a sauce, and that sauce being Da Bomb, was about as poetic as it can get, followed by screaming NIXON!😂
His table at the end 😂😂😂
That was epic - an Irish snowball going down a hill that lost all control and took everything out in its path.
Hot Ones GOAT
Conan is on a different planet than ANY other guest past or future. There will never be an equal to this.
Conan is a MAD MAN!!! Maybe the best guest in the shows history?
this is insanne, conans a legend
It would’ve been great if when Dr. Arroyo was checking on Conan at the end he tells him “You have 4 years tops”
Can’t let that dna out there
One of the best episodes!  I was dying laughing on that last half!  Pure brilliance!
People can give me billion dollars but i wouldn't try this and risk my health
Most vicious episode I have ever seen...Jesus.
Continuity error at about 17:30-17:50? Look at the sauces.
Conan is always awesome
Amazing
That was insane! How? We have seen every sort of man and woman lose it from just a drop, and here is Conan drinking this stuff with it slathered all over his face? I think we found our new king! They need to put his picture up on a wall or something.
Late Night Comedy Talk-Show Hosts (traditional format) official ranking: 1) Conan O’Brien 2) Johnny Carson 3) Craig Ferguson  4) Dave Letterman 5) Stephen Colbert  6) Seth Myers 7) Graham Norton 8) James Corden 9) Jay Leno 10) Jimmy (either one)
this should be the finale.
When he escalate at the end, I literally spit out my food i was laughing so hard. Great episode!
to quote Kirk Lazerus. "Never go fullre***d"
I looooove Conan, and this might be the best 27 minutes I’ve ever watched on a screen. I laughed so hard.
Best episode ever
Conan is the Man!!
Conan knew being cocky was a sure fire angle. It felt forced... until it got spicey, that was genuine pain.
The best to ever do it
absolute wildman!!
I love Conan
This thing is unhinged from the first minute 🤣  I dont even know if hes answering honestly so far. Nope, this is all a bit. Wow, what insane praise. Conan full on did his homework on the show and performed a whole show with multiple bits
Conan is a straight savage for this one.  Impressive
Is he even still human?
Go back to 1 table!! Covid is over!!!
😂🤣😂🤣Conan is absooooolutely ridiculous 😂🤣😂🤣 luv it
Conan being Conan
wow this totally gave me flashbacks to little me in the 90's staying up late to watch Conan when I should have been sleeping for school. Trying to laugh quietly at his wild antics and self deprecating humour style.  incredible how much he can make me laugh!
23:49 The hard cut to an obliterated eating zone while Conan's being serious and deep about comedy history was amazing.
I have been watching Hot Ones for ages. This is hands down, the BEST episode ever! Conan is by far my favorite agent of chaos!!! Love that man, we must protect him at all costs!!!❤😂
animal abuse 👎🏻
Dude Conan is the best 🔥🔥🔥
Its ok, i can die now, I’ve seen all i need to see.
This was the craziest out of format interview ever.
How to be saved from your sin, by accepting God's free gift   1 Corinthians 15:1-4  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:   Salvation is a free gift given by God.    I pray that God may soften your heart to be able to understand so that you may be saved and sealed till the day of redemption.
This is the absolute best performance of his that I’ve ever seen.  Masterful.
Conan's plug was funny, then unsettling, then upsetting until it looped back to funny again. But I gotta go to bed now, this was too much.
He didn't even got the chance to say you don't have to if you don't want to on the last dab.
I swear he spat on me!!!😂😂😂
No, you just 'feel' for the pulse.  I'm sorry...🙄
Bless Conan -- "this is nothing!"  (Turns increasingly crimson with each bite)
At this start of this epidose I thought "Oh, he's doing it character, that's lame." But by the end it was not lame.
I didn't realise how funny he is until this interview.
BEST EPISODE.EVER!!! Conan is a real savage and a madman but he's incredibly entertaining, absolutely hilarious. What a show!
he has got to be the absolute best guest on this show! completely owned this episode!
Episode directed by John Waters
I just wanted to see it end with a card saying something like "Conan died 1hr later....."
I don't know who the doctor actor was but he was great. And, oh yeah, Conan's appearance on this show can never be topped. Ever.
Bea Arthur lol classic
19:10 😂 “It’s not good.”
I loved this episode....Thank you.
Jesus
Best one ever ! ❤
Look at Conan just being Conan….He understood the assignment😂😂😂..Congrats to 23 seasons🫡…((Side-note Ice Spice is the Steve Seagal of Hot Ones))
this the best hot ones episode i have seem hands down
Most amazing episode of the show ever.....is Conan Steve Os dad?
My favorite episode hands down. Love Conan
Leo Spaceman school of medicology
You guys should add Plutonium No. 9 to your hot sauce repertory. There is the extract and the sauce. Go for both hahaha
This is just insane. He doesn’t even look like he’s in any pain. He didn’t even have any water or milk until after he poured da bomb all over and DRANK it. At his age, his insides must be melting. I’m surprised he was still able to enunciate after that.
Conan the 🐐 of late night 🌙  and its not even close
22:05 Now I know what Sona meant by that it's kind of impressing witnessing Conan battling through his food, LOL😂... He never ceases to amaze me
That was the best one by far!!
He adsolutely destroyed the wings of death.
absolute madness!
i will surely tell the story of this redhead monster to my grandkids.
The *BEST* episode of this series EVER!
Before the episode started I thought «Oh this is going to be good isn’t it?» I had no idea what I was in for😂
Conan is DA BOMB!
I like how it changed from water to milk at 17:19
LOL!!!!
Best episode ever
Conan still the same 😂
Conan really is one of the best entertainers in the world. He completely controls the space no matter which side of the table he sits on. Absolutely magnificent control of pace and balance of comedy.
I've watched every single Hot Ones in order and have many favorites. This may be the best episode ever!
Shades of Coolio
Conan is my favorite comedian/human he’s so witty and funny but also so genuine and kind. There’s been no better late night host in my opinion
That was pretty impressive 😂
Favorites Dave Grohl and now Conan O'Brein
21:40 Conan's hand trembling on the last dab 💀
I have heartburn just from looking at the thumbnail
“Why can’t I feel!” 🫵🤣
I romantically love Conan O'Brien
“Woo! Rick Flair.  Dr. Arroyo, please, could you step in? My pockets getting full.”
I think this takes the cake. Best episode ever  Conan is an absolute beast. And comedic genius.
CONAN THE CHAMP
Conan is an absolute monster and I am here for it!
Absolutely unhinged behaviour..."ARE WE ALIVE!!" Just the most Conan 😂😂
Conan putting that greasy wing in his denim jacket destroyed me he's so committed to the stupidest bits.
Man! What an absolute LEGEND!!! This is the best episode of the show by MILES and MILES. Maaan The hilarity!
Conan is the friggin best 🤣 the doctor bits had me dying. I really want to see the conversation of them pulling half eaten wings out of their pockets
Was he trying to off himself? The only thing I can compare this to is a blog that I used to read years ago about someone who consumed a whole bottle of hot sauce every day and wrote about it. He would douse his food with it and drink whatever was left. For changes of pace he would go into a restaurant and challenge the chef to make something so hot that he couldn't finish it. I believe he had kept his blog up somewhere between 100 and 200 days when his entries stopped. No explanation and no one knew what had happened to him. Many of his followers assumed he came to a bad end. I believe the blog was called The Smoking Tongue. I just looked it up and it's been removed. I hope Conan fared well in the suceeding days.
Mentions Letterman and then proceeds to say “the other guy”…. No love lost! Conan is legit
I gotta say, Conan was a pretty sustainable watch for me, even tho his show suffered from the same viewer fatigue that all staged and scripted late night esc shows have.   He just always seemed so willing to go off script. There were a couple times that I realized the show was scripted, because I could see the change from Conan ACTUALLY catching his guests off guard and making them laugh really hard. And vice versa. Bill Burr is one of his best guests for this reason, like I know Bill will shoe horn in some of his act cause hes promoting himself, but its once Conan rebutles that they start to go off script and laugh the hardest.   He seemed more weighed down by the medium I guess. Certainly not as insufferable as Jimmy Fallon or the others. Its nice to see him do other stuff, cause it just affirms that he has that same energy wherever he is. Harder to laugh than some, can easily make others laugh, rewards people with his genuine laugh for things that are objectively funny. Not quick to offend but clearly cant help but find offensive things funny. Hes all-round one of my favorite talk show hosts
Wow, what an incredible show. Just wow. Conan is just awesome!
Legend says he's still saying "I'm fine! I'm perfectly f'ing fine!" 3 days later.
Conan: “I want you to know how sincerely I respect you as an interviewer, because I am about to hijack your entire show.”
WHATS THE POINT OF BEING ALIVE IF WE CANT DO THIS‼️🔥
Conan has always been my favorite host
I was wondering why Conan is so popular in Finland and I think I figured it out : before he makes fun of anyone he makes fun of himself. That allows him to make fun of everyone else. That is The Finnish Mentality: You want something to be done? Don't throw anyone in there but volunteer yourself if you think it is necessary. Want to have laugh at someone? Start with laughing to your welfare and when you laugh to others they see you are not mean, but guy who finds world funny, and maybe is funny and ridicoulous himself.
This guy is such a genius. Wish I had that intelligence omfg.
Just INSANE, BEST and BEAUTIFUL episode 🥰 Conan rules!!
Connan is a force of nature, you cannot control it, just let it be... Also I'm pretty sure that he got high of those hot sauces, he definitely set the at the highest level possible
Good Lord! What a Legend..! 💥💯
CHEW WITH YOUR MOTH CLOSED!
Conan passed and flew by everyone else who has ever been on the show and tore into the bottles and went for more. WOW.
Conan: This is a 10/10 show. Let's make it an 11.
wow mr. Conan O'Brien really went unhindged truly well played
Those IR forehead thermometers dont work
Best one yet. The bar has been raised and good luck breaking it. C.O. By fare the best!
Legendary one!
Not only does this episode solidify Conan O'Brien as the best interviewer/comedian ever but also that this is the best episode the Charlie Rose with Buffalo wings 🔥 interview show has ever recorded!
"The other guy."   Taste buds weren't the only thing burned...
This show makes me crave chicken wings every time I watch it
Ain't nobody does it like that Conan.
5mill in 3 days
Shoutout to the illustrators who made the water buffalo sequence
This has to be the best Hot Ones interview I have seen.
let's go Brandon 🥲🥲
lol, awesome
This is an an absolute CLASSIC!!!
I always liked Conan but my god, one of the questions he mentioned show business and shoot does he know what he's talking about
Best Hot Ones episode I have ever seen. Crying laughing
Conan needs to start making movies now
Wise words from a wise and stable man.
Passed the torch
Best show ever
This is one of the best episodes 😂 I hope Conan comes back
Jay Leno being "the other guy" like the late night host that must not be named is hilarious.
He asked him 4 questions Conan stole the show!! He’s hands down my favorite person ever
Conan is doing therapy in this episode
Best episode yet!
he shat blood that night guaranteed
The best episode with the funniest man!!!
Wow, thanks for saving the best for last. Conan brought his A game and I roared with his nonstop creativity. Sean definitely enjoyed this ride.
I'm speechless😅
I love Conan! He’s the only host that I have really invested time in to watching. He just comes off as so real and in the moment and he’s unapologetically himself. It’s refreshing! I’m excited to watch his new show
what a performance from Conan the last 3 wings, my jaw was actually dropped LOL
This has got to be the greatest Hot Ones episode of all time.
They unleashed a beast unintentionally 😂😂😂😂😂
I didn't want this interview to end! I've never laughed so hard at an episode of Hot Ones 😂😂😂😂
Respect
OH MY GOD!
"My intestines have turned into acid." 😂😂😂
Who puts sauce on something in that way ?
I left Hot Ones last year. The Conan O'Brien episode brought me back. What a fucken mad genius.  Serial Killer potential.
“Actions have consequences.”  Conan- “Hold My Hotsauce.”
Awesome
This is the most unhinged thing I’ve ever seen on YouTube.
This is the best thing I have ever watched on yt 🦖Conan is my absolute favorite!
Thank you   Conan takes the golden crown  for the only talk show host that gets me laughing thru any delema  .
What a guy!!
Hahaha.
As a fan from the very beginning.. this HAS to be one of if not THE best episode EVER! 🔥🔥🔥
23:30 I can't be this eloquent if you gave me a 100 hours to prepare beforehand.  But Conan with his face and mouth burning proceeds to give an eloquent piece of advice without a single stutter or misplaced word, that too without any preparation!
laughed the harest ever on hot ones😂
Wait for it
Deep respect, that gotta burn like a lava M-f****  Have a pleasure time in the bathroom :D
This is amazing! LOLOL
Does anyone know who made the jacket Conan is wearing??
I like how camera was almost constantly at Conan. That was a wild ride!
He must be on speed or something else making him immune to the pain :)
Conan: thanks for doing the central time zone New Year's Eve countdown
Best episode of First we feast !
GOAT.
I think… i just witnessed a psychotic breakdown 😂
I love Conan. I don't follow him, but I watch him when he pops up.
Does he have Covid or something that he can’t feel anything?
Conan hands down showed everyone that he is and will ever will be... the G.O.A.T
Sean's got another video to hit millions
Conan is a just a brilliant kind of funny
As someone who’s seen many crazy Japanese shows, I know that Conan has gotten endless diarrhea the next day. Conan is the King of comedy👑
This was brilliant 😂
Legendary episode, holy f**k
Dear lord this was amazing. Conan, you have outdone yourself yet again.
What was with the photo they showed of a guest with weird calves? They showed it and then didn’t explain
Wow he's rowdier than Steve Martin, at least on camera.
I bet Conan's colon had many regrets the next morning.
That was awesome! I yelled and screamed at him my leg was shaking😂😂😂❤️
Conan is the real G
i wish conan was god
Commitment to the show. Thank you Conan.
He aint gonna make it to his birthday
I want to have this much energy at 35 let alone what age Conan is age. Biggest menace and chilli swigging animal on the show to date
What an absolute legend
Best episode ever! CONAN is the GOAT!!
This is, what the kids call, "the goat" lol
This is how a master does it.
“Waaaahhh, what’s gonna happen!??”
Amazing
Perhaps the best episode yet. Respect to Conan for going above and beyond. GG
Legendary
This has dethroned the Gordon Ramsey one as my favorite episode 😂😂😂❤❤❤ GOAT
Conan's the best!
Love Love Love Conan is awesome.
I almost never laugh out loud and I haven't laughed that hard in so long! Conan ❤
Best episode of Hot Ones
Somehow my eyes are watering more (from laughing) than Conan's
Haha this guys is a beast
that sneaky tame impala refrence
Legend
That’s how you promote a new show!! That fella Max should give Conan bonus 🔥
conan is unhinged 😭
Conan with the FULL SEND!!!!
Oh Conan wait until you go #2
This episode was absolute gold! Also, Sean's looks of concern, as Conan was dousing his wings with the sauce, were so sincere! He was trying to save Conan with his eyes! 😂
Conan absolutely destroyed, Well played sir.
Are the chicken wing bones for his Dalmatian?
Conan Conan Conan!!! Woooohoooo
Wow 😂😂😂😂😂
Conan’s understanding of comedy is elite, such a great episode
one of the best appearances on the show
IM FINE
this didn't disappoint. :X
A Conan O'Brien masterclass! Dr. Arroyo with the honorable mention!
I love Conan 🙌 been watching him since I was a kid, he's the best
Sick of Conan claiming he’s Irish and then constantly bashing us. He hasn’t a clue what he’s talking about.
Now I have to watch the show.
How does anyone beat this episode 😂😂
This was amazing!
he drank the bottle. HE DRANK THE BOTTLE!!!!!
Okay I think that was the wildest I've ever seen conan get
First time I have ever seen a guest chug the sauces, lol.  He went all in!!!
This is my favourite episode of Hot Ones, by far! I couldn't stop laughing.
best episode ever. Conan you are king. hats off to you sir
Amazing
So. . .  Bill Burr and Conan dual episode next, right? Let's see if Conan can keep his composure while eating wind AND listening to Bill rant.
😂😂😂😂😂. Conan is a very funny guy
I'm calling it right now this is the best episode ever.
True geniuses are insane
No jokes - Conan is a different breed and is a special human who LOVES to entertain.  You can't fake that behavior.  That's someone who thoroughly enjoys what he does and i'm here for it.
I don’t get the Conan love.
Ummm  The best ever
🔥😂
Comedic genius
G.O.A.T
Conan says "Max" and i start thinking about two Weinbergs making love to each other.
Beautiful
true king！
the spiciest thing Conan had as a child was cabbage.
Hands down the craziest on in hot ones
legendary!!!!!
This was the best fhcking episode ever
This is too good!!!! One of the best episodes!!!
Conan has always been one of a kind.
best show ever
Well there it is. The best episode ever.
True hero, sacrificing his intestines in order to promote a show.
Tilda Swinton
One of the best episodes i have ever watched.....conan fan and as always he delivers. ....😂😂
Best hot ones episode of all time, hands down! I havent laugh cried like that in a long time, thank you Conan!
Y'all I have been watching this show since DAY ONE... NEVER seen anything like it. MADNESS. Conan is an absolute LEGEND.
One for the ages.
CONAN!!!!
best ep ever, and that says a lot
Awesome
Conan took on those hot sauces like a man.😊
Conan said sweet things, but...  Him FULLY committing to this show with all the energy and passion he could muster is the highest praise he could have given Sean.  It's the ultimate sign of respect in improv comedy.
Well this is what hosting is.fully committed
Slowly Transformed into the Joker....  one Wing at a time.      What a LEGEND xD
Conan, if nothing else, is a beast. What a legend. It's truly incredible though, did he use an antiseptic or wax or some other trick? I have high spice tolerance but... That much Da Bomb? No way man... That's too much.
We love you, Conan, but don't hurt yourself for our entertainment. Your affordable doctor, which I'm suspicious his degree was totally online, at least needs to know the straightest way to county hospital. We can't lose a jewel like you.
sean always says he tries to match the guest bite for bite but he met his match with conan.
🤢🤢
Legend
man, Conan took the time to acknowledge Sean and the teams work.  Bravo FWF and Hats off to Conan! By far the best FWF!! Conan is legend. <3
I can’t stop watching this.
actually one of the funniest hot ones episodes ever
Conan is the KING. What a showman, he really went all-in to give us "The greatest show in the world".  And on top of that he handled the hot sauce like a real champ. All hail King Conan the GOAT.
Hes more entertaining than 10 Ice Spice interviews!!
xDxDxDxD
*Standing ovation*
Conan destroyed it! 😂😂😂 He never disappoints.
A great dynamic between these two! Professional and calm VS funny and hysterical, I love Conan and really hope he could visit a real doc after this
I mean he's the GOAT! Who puts extra DaBomb and lives to tell the story? Love this guy! One of the best eps
This was the BEST episode of this show hands down! 😂❤
Conan is just the best!
i love conan
The three stooges sound... perfect😂
I always love watching this show, and Sean is a fantastic interviewer, but this episode had me laughing so hard that tears were running down my face.
was totally expecting Andy to eat for him. one of the best episodes. Conan killed it. must be his freakish irish heritage that protected him from the spice
When was the last time I cried laughing? Oh my god that was impressively funny
heheehah
I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. Conon O'Brien is such a comedic genius.
This makes me proud to have been a Conan fan for my whole life
I swear. Conan is gold, everywhere and anywhere. This man deserves every achievement award.
he's legit insane.
We need Conan back on TBS! Miss his show he was absolutely the best host hands down
Conan is not Irish. Conan is not real. There's no way he can destroy the Da'bomb like that, this is all AI
Conan doing this at his age for the "show biz" is the reason why he's where he is for 30 years
the king
Conan is the greatest man on earth
The manic energy in this episode is so high we could power New York if we could harness it.
Anything after this, is just going to be meh. Sorry next season guests 😂
Best episode no doubt
Best episode of all time
Well HBO made a solid choice picking Conan to do a travel series. I'm definitely subscribing for it.
Great Show
I honestly don't think I have ever laughed so hard at an episode.
Power over spice, is power over all.
Great episode!
Holy Fk. He wing dropped hard. Conan King of Host
I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. Conan O'Brien longevity is impressive - funny in the 90's and funny now!
A LEGEND!
I love watching interviewers be interviewed idk why lop
Midlife crisis eating wings. Get that man a convertible and a blonde :D
bruh gotta have covid that’s craaazyy
unhinged brilliance
Conan killed it!!!!
I felt like I just watch the best action movie ever, but, like….  WAAAAYYYYY BETTER!
Conan's pained scream should be your outro to every episode.
My God is Conan obnoxious!
Conan showing signs of Covid.
absolute legend , a true mad lad of comedy!
i have a new hero
What an amazing episode.
The fact that he survive the bomb 🤯
Conan is hilarious... I bet he is regretting all that da bomb hot sauce.. we all know it's the worst one to eat
Sean’s look of fear and admiration at 22:37 is an all-time great moment
I'm in tears 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan is HOT!
One of the best episodes ever. Conan did really understand what was being asked of him so he made the show his own. Outstanding Conan.
Best episode EVER!!
This was by far my favorite episode!!!
If you think Irish food is tasteless, you are not Irish. That said Conan is amazing. A legend. A genius. Perfection. His words are as wise as I have ever heard, he could save America.
Conan set the bar real high,no guest can ever recreate this aura,❤😂
He went in gg
Conan  never disappoint us
Conan = GOAT!!!!
Blurblururue I HAVE A SHOW. 😂
Its interesting that Conan says telling the audience its not going well is a bad move when one of his best guests over the years, Marc Maron, would do that and even himself would ongoingly say "no ones watching this" lol I guess its funny to do in a self deprecating way when people are having fun but real awkward if it is actually going south
CONAN!!!!! WHOA!!! Amazing LOL
🐐
Conan is a legend in my book. From his talk shows to this interview. A living legend deserving of his flowers.
He doesn’t even understand the numbers 😂 classic Conan
Medical school “In 1998” and the baseline pulse is “there”. That doctor bit was perfect and priceless!
i LOVE Conan
That was awesome!  Conan O'Brien is the man!
Best. Episode. Ever.
Conan came here to make sure NO ONE could one up this episode 💀
Conan not only stole the show, but the dude absolutely destroyed the wings and probably set the new bar. I dont remember a guest who just covered the last 3 wings in extra sauce and proceeds to drink it after lol
Seeing the thumbnail, I knew I want to watch this.. at the 20 minute mark I wanted to never see the thumbnail.
Get Craig Ferguson on here
Dude.. Conan is one of the 🐐’s
The standby paramedics: "Looks like today's finally our day!"
This must be the best video in this channel and that says a lot. Conan is an etertaiment machine
Anyone else getting alien lizard vibes from Conan?
If its possible to win "Hot Ones" he totally nailed it. He's the GOAT.
Haha Team Coco all the way! 😂
Why did you go Coco?!
Conan unalived Bea Aurthur!
I’m happy to see that new generation who didn’t grow up with him see the genius that is Conan. Please watch the show on max when it comes out  he’s a legend and a amazing thing to see him interact with strangers
Best one ever. ❤
pure comedy!
The greatest guest and interview yet😂😂😂
Lisan Al Ghaib!
My god, Conan is honestly the best
The best Hot Ones ever...been watching Conan for 30 years(man I'm old) and I love that guy.   Amazing job Conan, you are legend!
I’m watching this for the second time in a row and now it feels like he had the whole thing scripted in his head down to a millisecond, while during the first watched it felt like a complete improvisation, I’m in awe
That was outstanding! Kudos Mr O'Brien!
5 million views in 3 days. Conan is crushing it. Absolutely brilliant comedy madness. 😂
What a RIDE! 🔥🔥🔥
This is what 100% dedication to comedy looks like. Conan is a legend.
He's a funny dude but his passion is as real as it gets.
Legend
BEST EPISODE EVER ! !!
This is like the complete opposite of the DJ Khaled interview. Conan finished all the wings while being respectful, intelligent and entertaining.
The way he'll say Letterman but won't name leno...can't say I blame him at all.  Conan you were awesome and you deserved so much better than what you had to deal with my dude.
Legitimately the best episode ever
i need to see conan and bobby lee together
sweet jesus. this is by far the best ep
His eye color matched his hair color by the end of the interview. Insane. 🔥 🔥 🔥
"check for a pulse" "..... its there"  LOL DEAD
Best episode ever. Of any show. Game of Thrones, Cheers, MASH, nothing beats this.
Sit perfectly still, only I may dance.
This is one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen in my life. I had to pause it several times to laugh hard with tears running down my face. I don’t even want to think about why it’s funny. I just want to appreciate its comedic hilarity.
I CRIED
I think this has to be the best guest I've ever seen on this show. I wish we had him in the UK.
This guy just embrace the pain
This is comedy gold.
Ask Conan how Haiti is these days.
Conan, a national treasure
I was laying down kinda sad and thought nothing could brake through my sad wall. Thank you Conan you did it! you mfefer you did it!!!!
Finally! ❤ Also, best guest, no contest.
This is by far the best episode ever! Conan is just a legend.
💥There’s no other hot ones before this and no other hot ones after. This is IT.💥
only one Max and it's MAX WEINBERG
This and Bobby Lee.  Best episodes ever.
Such a legendary performer. Never less than 100%. A study in commitment. Thanks for hosting him.
That was truly a TOTAL TAKEOVER like OH MY LORD Conan is the absolute BEST AT WHAT HE DOES !!! He’s unbeatable and him complimenting Sean on his interviewer skills has to be one of the highest points of our favorite baldy’s career 😂😂😂
Why did Conan become the joker when he was like you can't stop me from being who I am
This is my favourite episode by far loved every second of this
Grace under fire 😂😂😂😂
He is more Eric Andre than Eric Andre was when he was on this show
By far my favorite episode!!! Conan is untameable and Sean is a perfect counterpart to keep it going. Love this 😂
madness a hot ones HOT AND CRAZY!!
Conan is something else. I’ve been watching him since his first late night show and his scripts on the Simpsons.
This is why Conan is a beast to be reckoned with.
This was amazing. I'm in tears
Such a good sport! 🎉👏👏👏
I think this is it, boys and girls: The best episode of all time, and its not even close.
Conan is the gift that keeps on giving
Conan is so epic!
Beastly!
greatest ever!!
Incredible
Suprising sean didnt match conan on the spice 😂
Good thing this was the season finale cuz there's no way anyone could possibly follow that magnificence
In my top 3 favourite episodes.
Music just does not work in this episode.
That was the damndest thing I've ever seen on this show. Conan no-selling better than the pro-wrestlers!
A very epic guest.  Right up there with Gordon Ramsay and Shia LaBouf.  The one sauce that is constant on all the Seasons is THA BOMB.  I think that says everything about the legitimacy of THE ONES sauces.  Anyway, very funny episode.
I love this man 😂
Conan is so good! I love this episode
OOOHHHHH YEEEAAAAHHHHH!!!
CANAN <3
That got me by surprise,  it just built and built till I couldn't stop laughing
Ok..... that' officially the best episode ever.  What a performance.
chicken wing in the pocket is wild lol
Conan earns the title of Spice Lord, but Jenna Ortega still the GOAT. Conan embraced the pain and allowed it to lead him to ecstasy, Jenna simply was immune to it.
I call it Autopilot when that happens at work. Lucky he didn't get worse. By hopping on the water buffaloes back you challenged it with a show of dominance. Gotta respect the animal, what it is and what it can do. Humans are pretty fragile compared to most mammals.
Conan truly is the best to ever do it.
Dude looks like the scream painting in the thumbnail
How fake can you get?
Just saw who the guest is, and I already know it will be the best show ever!- have to watch it now!
I am so shamelessly uplifted, this is sidesplitting
the greatest of all time
Oh wow, he's still alive?
This season there has been episode after episode where the guest has taken the smallest litttle nibble off of each wing. Finally, we have fully embracing the challenge. Conan is my hero.
Conan you rocked that episode!  I think your the best guest ever. I’ve had some those hot sauces and I can’t believe you were still coherently talking at the end. Swigging out of the bottle, Loved it!
Coronation of Charlemagne absolutely MOGGED. Conan is King of Hollywood.
This is my #1.  Hillarious
This will go down as a top five, possibly the greatest Hot Ones ever!
Holy cow, I was just listening to this show without watching and I tuned in to look right at the end and it made it so much funnier
by far the best of them all, Conan is the man and I was not even a fan... Until now!
he became Rick and Morty at the end 💀
This might be the best episode yet.
Conan is about as funny as stage 4 cancer
FUCK'N LEGEND.
Wing drop
SEAN!!!!! PLEASE GET SAM THE COOKING GUY !!!!
Conan comes on and just takes over. Really funny...here for it. 🤣🤣
This has got to be one of the best episodes ever 😂
Wow this is easily one of the BEST episodes ever
This was certainly uhh…. gross.
Conan drinking Hot Wing sauce proves gingers don't feel pain.
What you don't see here is Conan drinking an entire candle's worth of melted wax ahead of the shoot.
Awesome episode,  my favorite!! Love Coco!!!
this is my favorite part of 2024
It literally does not matter what context you put Conan in. He will do the greatest show he's ever done.
Witness how a LIVING LEGEND pushes the limits of whats CONTROLLED CHAOS and just pure comedic lunacy all while  giving great insight into his mind & career....... and through all this kept me laughing hysterically!!!! great interview!!!!!!
This is why Conan will always be one of the greatest in Entertainment.
This one really made up for the horror show that was ice spice. We thank you Conan from the bottom of our hearts.
What a terrible guest.
Best one ever.
Conan making Steve-O look like a lightweight
The BEST episode yet on Hot Ones. Conan knows how to live life to the extreme.
Iv never laughed so hard in my life, what a beast.
That was entertainment to say the least. Love it!
Why is my mouth watering during the whole show! lol
I think Connan just ended this series 😂 no one will top this legend 🎉
Conan was a complete animal!!!
Always loved Conan he’s honestly the funniest talk show host I’ve ever seen. Always enjoyed his show
23:29 the greatest monolog ever
Didn't think Kevin Hart's episode would be topped 😂 Conan is a nut
🌶️🌶️Wow! The whole show! It felt like 5 minutes not almost half an hour! Splendid! Conan is STILL hot and timely as ever! Loved it! 🌶️🌶️
I absolutely love Conan. But it was hard seeing him treat the whole interview as a very artificial skit. I was hoping to see genuine Conan… not an incredibly difficult to watch awkward fest.
Maybe the best episode ever.
He’s the funniest man my generation knows. We salute you, Coco!
Nixon was an incredibly clever man
Conan Conan Conan!!!
I loved the cartoon story
😂😂 This was awesome
bring back the old table, this two table setup is silly, takes the intimacy away and is just a bad reminder of past
That was so funny. Conan is my favorite. Hilarious. I want to know how the rest of his day went after doing that. LOL
I have not laughed that hard in a long time - tears of joy...
LEGEND
“Dr Arroyo” has been on Conan’s shows many times over the years. Good to see him still doing characters 😂
Hemorrhoids Episode is Coming Soon on Conan Show.
I love conan! Funniest episode 🤣
this guy is a RIOT, dude
I just bought a denim jacket, will be taking style tips from Conan.
Aging isn't for the weak!
y'all need to release every second of footage y'all have of this man. so good
the best episode ever
Props to the whole crew. This is one of the best. Props to Conan. He is the best.
How is he even talking at the end?
4.9m in just 3 days? Sheeeesh
Conan's the least fake celeb out there.
That was Epic! 😂😂
Tremendously entertaining. Thank you.
The ABSOLUTE BEST episode yet. Conan is just so unbelievably relatable and the way he had Sean just dying makes me love Conan even more.
We all owe Conan just about everything we can give him. He's done nothing but give us laughs for decades. This man is pure gold. From Simpsons to this interview. Absolute Legend.
Conan is a national treasure.
I got only one question, did you have to rebuilt the studio's bathroom after the show was done? Because I highly doubt that Connor didn't destroy it after all of this.
Great interview. Sean does sound a lot like aron from conans team sometimes. For a moment i though aron was saying something from the sidelines.
I'm at 14:23, just after Conan starts chugging sauce... I thought for sure at the start he was gonna get fire lips and feel the burn. But oh gawd no. What a champ so far. I'm waiting on the crowd favorite Da Bomb.
Has any other guest drank from the bottle??
COMMIT TO THE BIT!
I was hoping Conan would do his laugh.  Great video anyways
Conan is the GOAT
"What's the point of even being alive if we aren't gonna do this!", that really spoke to me.
this was hilarious!!!!!
They finally got him! 😂
I was wondering if he ever went to ER (real one) after the show.
I absolutely love this show, and I adore O'Brien, but this was so hard to watch, and I couldn't take my eyes off it. It was like "Requiem For a Dream" but with poultry. Bravo!
Mans turned to Fuhrer in the end 😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is what I though Eric Andre’s interview was going to be like
I think u got pink eye man 😂
Me when he first put a wing in his pocket " He's going to have to watch that jacket now."  Me by the end of the episode " he might as well just throw that thing away"
Ive been watching (and loving) Conan for years and just when you thought he couldnt get any funnier well......that day has just happened ladies and gentleman! Mark it on your calenders.
Sean looked genuinely worried at the end when Conan sloshed the “last dab” all over the wing, and then drank from the bottle 😂😂
Meh, comes across as desperate.
The amount of times I said NOOOO! Out loud…. Someone get Conan to the hospital. 🌶️ 🔥 😂
The Legend with a lot of speed bumps 😂
By far, the best Hotone's Champion. We've finally found the anti-DJ Khalid. Sean's face @22:36 says it all. Way to go, all these years later and he's still Conan O'Brien!!
21:07 this is the moment Conan became a barbarian
This was amazing Haven’t laughed this much in a while!
BRILLIANT COMEDY PERFORMANCE.
Conan had his dr give him covid before going in so he couldnt taste anything, no concern for others around him, unbelievable 😢
This is exactly what Robin Williams would've done. This is pure comedy at its best 😂😂😂😂
Has to be a top 5 performance and it ain’t 2-5
Legendary.
You need to get @VinDiesel. Conan rocked!
Best episode EVER!
Im legit crying from laughter! 🤣🤣 Best Hot Ones EVER!!
great interview , terrible background music choice
This. This is the guest it's been building up to. Peak Hot Ones performance.
I have no desire to be famous. But if I ever get famous, I want to be “guest on Hot Ones” famous.
Wow
This man is brilliant
This might just be the best Hot Ones Interview ever 😂
What a legend.
It's Conan O'Brien's world. We're just living in it.
This episode is a definition of true entertainment! Conan is the all time MVP of this show hands down!🙂
Shout out to Jose as the Doctor, love seeing the Conan writing crew.
what's wrong with me, why can't i feel?🤣🤣🤣🤣
I haven’t laughed this hard in a while. Love Conan
This.... ladies and gentlemen...... is pure genius on Conan's part.
Thats how you eat wings on Hot Ones, not those tiny baby bites✌🏼
Best episode ever :D :D
He's truly an animal of a man. Iconic episode for sure
this is gold
I love you Canon, applause! And im 1/4 asian! I thought i could eat hot! Ja Golden!
Ah dang I forgot why late night shows existed initially. Conan’s great
Oh my! I love Conan. My oh my. That was an interview.
Conan is a corporate shill with no connection to humanity 👎👎👎🤮
Best guest so far
he clearly loves his job, .. favourite thing he can do on his birthday
the last good late night host
Conan dominated the sauces, dominated the interview, dominated the room, dominated the entertainment. Hi dom daddy
If Conan is on your show, you are the guest. He deserves all the love in this world.
One of the best.
Greatest episode ever.
No offense to any other talk show hosts but Conan has always been my GOAT.
Ask him his opinion on Haiti
A masterclass in entertainment and a masterpiece show with a master
Leave it to Conan to make this whole thing a bit.
What a finish. The hotsauces brought out Conan's eloquance to the hilt. Bravo. I miss this man and Craig Ferguson deeply.
Has anyone in the history of media worked harder for a plug?
feel like Conan  BEEN on here
that was insane, a drop is enough to down me, and this guy was chugging and rubbing it all over his face 🤣
Well, Conan certainly commits to the bit(e).
Great episode.
Best episode ever❤
Best interview ever. Conan just completely dominated here.
aint no way bro's playing like that with real hot souce IMAO this is obviusly a bit
The more spice Conan consumed, the more pale he became and more red his hair turned. Amazing.
Manic
Feels like watching history unfold
Oh. My god. I put this on to fall asleep to while having a nap and I could NOT stop watching. I'm dead. Thus is my favourite episode so far. Hats off to the craziness that is conan o brien😂
Been watching since the beginning, and this is the greatest episode hands down.
It would have been better if Dr Arroyo was played by Jordan Schlansky or Andy Richter
This is the first tie I watched this sho just because Conan was the guest. And I loved it! I subscribes and I'm going to watch all the other episodes, woohoo!
conan = 🐐
im 2 days late on the eposiode? how is he?
I can't believe i didn't think this was going to be anything less than side splittingly hilarious. Really gotta admire Conan for absolutely committing to comedy and just going completely wild. I think his best trait is the fact that you never know if he's joking or being entirely serious with you, but you that he's doing it for the comedic value.  Watch until the end, this interview really ramps up!
I think he won.
“Wise words from a wise and stable man,” indeed. 😂
I'll have what he's having
This is by far the best hot ones so far!
This will go down as one of the absolute best shot Ones episodes ever created.   But neither men were seen for five days after the shoot. May go have mercy on their intestinal track.
Best episode ever 😂👌🏼
Conan is scary!
Maybe?  Will we get a chance to see Connor return with a few jars of small gifts to "share" with his office mates?
LOL
I don't think I've ever laughed so hard from this show. 😭
Conan rules
Go Co-Co!  Awesome job with the wings! Very fun to watch!
Conan lost it and I’m here for it. 😂😂😂 also, did he answer any questions during the second half?? I also blacked out. 🤣☠️☠️
This is the most unhinged Conan since the 90s. After his innards explode...he'll look fondly back on this moment. Pure COCO
I hate  added background music
And now we know why Conan won the Late Night Wars.
What about doing Jordan Scmansky!!!!??
Bring Jordan Shlansky please. 😂😂😂let him analyze the origin... composition... effect and the undoubtedly inevitable Italian association of each  sauce.
Whats wrong with me? Why cant I feel? 😂😂😂😂
I love the fact that for every question, Conan has an answer already loaded and immediately goes into it.  It feels like we got so much out of this episode because of it.
Brilliant.
Rarely do I ever watch an entire YouTube video but I devoured it as much as Conan devoured the wings. And sauce. Makes me wonder if he got COVID and then lost some of his taste which never returned
This is the most insane episode ever. The amount of sauce this man just took in at the higher end of the table while not reacting is insane. I've never laughed so much through one of these. Thank you, Conan. You're the GOAT.
Call the wife!!!!  Hahaha
Should have did the episode at Haiti.
Dude ran full sprint at the thesis of the show
what did i just watch
Conan is one of my favourite people in the world
More evidence of why Conan is the King of Comedy
Although no one will ever top this, can you guys try to get Dev Patel? Sean needs to ask him more interesting questions than all the basic interviewers are…
Conan is a legend!! 🤣
Conan on a normal Thursday
Love that his sanity just declined at the end lol.
I'm impressed on how much info is up in that little Irish noggin of his, from presidents to classic literature to milk spewing
Legend
❤❤❤❤Conan
I can’t wait to watch him on HBO I mean Max… 🤣🤣🤣
This is definitely the best and most epic Hot Ones ever! Conan is hilarious
You know, I was surprised for one second when Conan put on extra sauce on the wings and took a swig from the bottle. Then I remembered that this is Conan, it's part for the course.
The King. Best ep by far!
Wow. Absolutely amazing.
Conan is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining guests on Hot Ones.
This was absolutely insane lol, loved it!!
20:57 absolute chaos. Love you Conan 😂
Given how many people have been in pain by sauce 4 or 5, for Conan to be taking swigs right out of the bottles is insane. I love it
Conan is actually funny
All these sauces are gangsta until Conan shows up. 😂
FUNNIEST MAN ALIVE . Irish champion of laughter
We love you, Conan. You've earned forgiveness for what you did to Terrance and Philip
Conan O’Brien Needs a Napkin
I will pay good money to see Graham Norton on here
This was great
I love how you can see the heat hitting him, but he channels evey ounce of whatever spicy pain is there into sheer manic energy to power through it.
One of the best Hot Ones ever! Maybe one of the best interviews ever. Conan is a legend.
They used to call it HBO, but people found that too POPULAR
Conan isn't a national treasure... He's a GLOBAL treasure!
This is Hot Ones with your host, Conan O Brien, with special guest Sean Evans. Amazing!
truly a masterpiece.
Conan youre a beast!
Conan is a genius
He's far too hyper of a person to be stunned, the sauce just fuels him.
This is probably the best episode of Hot Ones ever! 🔥
You have to rub in your eyes, Conan!
Now contrast that to "DJ" Kahled or whatever that loser is called...
NOTHING can top this episode. “Wing drop” 😂  So good !
Conan the G.O.A.T! ❤
Absolutely funniest episode of Hot Ones ever
Omfg that's the first HO's I need to process before I can say how good it was. 😅
Love Conan's denim jacket. Where do you get one of those?
This was a goat episode
A little Jack Nicholson at the end
One of the top 10 ever! Top 3
“Dr. Arroyo, not the best but affordable” 🤣🤣
Conan is a fvcking legend 😮
the best episode ever.
Oh nice our birthdays are two days apart! Lol happy early birthday
Conan is the he best! What an animal 😂
CHAPPELL ROAN!! CHAPPEL ROAN!!
26:08 bald dude was being dead serious here, that he doesnt want dirt on his jacket and doesnt trust conan because maybe he'll try to be funny and intentionally ruin his jacket, but nah Conan knows his limits and respectful
This man is a beast
What the ef is goin on here 😂
This is the best episode of anything ever.
Dude is so cringe
Conan is great but it’s so much "show" near the end, that it loses its genuineness, which is the point of an interview, imo. Also I don't know if he can handle the heat or if he's faking.
Oh my glob.  Conan is insane.   And I love it!!
Soooo...did Conan debunk "Hot" ones?
Conan just killing it, bit by bit.
Conan is the only talk show host who I never found to be cringe. He’s awesome!
He looks like a chicken
Why the bones in the pocket? 💀
Too much
I think this interview changed me as a person 😂 such incredible entertainment with genuine wisdom for life. You guys should watch conans commencement address, hes brilliant.
One of the BEST episodes EVER !!
Pure gold
I love how Conan claims to not feel a thing, but with each wing he gets more and more red and wild.
Absolutely incredible. Bravo.
This has been the best Hot Ones guest, respect for Conan just doubled.
Easily the best thing Conan has ever did "professionally"!!!
Conan is KING
I think maybe Conan shoulda brought a psychologist instead of a doctor.
Conan is a Legend😂😂❤❤
The wings and the show and the sauces were completely dominated by Conan. Had to be the best ever.
Conan is a pure entertainer. Can feel he is getting the energy from the cameras
So glad I got around to watching this. One of the best ones I've seen!
LEGEND!
this man is crazy🤣
Conan is simply the GOAT
long live the king
One of the best interviews of ALL TIME. GOAT HALL OF FAME 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
when conan dies in about 4 years, humanity will end.
That was amazing :D
Conan saying the advise "There's funny everywhere" while he is drooling and with sauce smeared all over his mouth is not just funny but also true, poetic, and inspiring. I consider him as the greatest comedian ever and him saying that advise in a funny way and while looking funny really just shows why he is the best.
Never saw a spice until he was 52 years old 😂😂😂😂
What’s with the fake doctor shtick and putting half eaten wings into his own pockets? It’s about as funny as a funeral.  Probably works for an American audience though, I made it just over half way through and had to stop it when all the shouting started.
Only guy who got a (probably standing) ovation from the crew.
This outfit is unwearable now.
Whi have we not seen this guy portrait Joker yer???
Conan! ❤
This is legendary!!!
And this is why know one can touch him he's unstoppable he's a master he's the one and only Is conan o'bryan take that Jay Leno. 😮😂😂😂
Conan = legend. This was amazing, and is now my favorite Hot Ones episode!
this was absolute gold. conan is a legendary guest hahahahh
New reigning hot ones champ right there. Drop the mic!
Sean looks scared at the end lol
Only way this could have been any better would have been if Jordan had been on the episode as well. Maybe as a solo guest sometime in the future?
Oh Conan you are legendary!😂
Unhinged! GOAT guest!
This is Emmy-worthy! 😀
This is a comedy gold, Conan  once again proves he is the best talk show host to be in late night.
Insane 😂
this is the most coked out ive ever seen conan
Best episode ever
Absolutely hilarious!
Conan has been so consistent all his career.  Too good for a late night show
“I never saw a spice till I was 52 yrs old”. Conan is hilarious!
One of the best episodes
The intentionality it takes for a man to vacillate between relating presidential history arcana like a scholar and spewing an appetizing mix of milk, hot sauce, and oro-nasal secretions is incredible. Sean picked up on it when he said none of this is a mistake. Another testament to Conan’s genius! Love the man!
That Conan show actually seems lit. I used to love the travel segments when he did the late night show
I haven't laughed this hard at an interview in a long time. Conan is the man.
The best episode ever. Hands down. Pure Conan Genius.
Incredible episode!
Whatever Conan is on, he becomes the host.
Also Conan schooled Sean and showed him the peak of his craft in the most endearing way.
I think people are getting ulcers just by watching it haha! Conan is the beast! and the best!
Showing my age: When Conan says "Max" at the beginning saying it's an awkward name, hearing his voice say "Max" made me think of The Max Weinberg 7.
Ladies and Gentlemen.. the Benchmark for future shows. 🌶
Conan was will and forever be my favourite ❤.Love you Conan ❤❤❤❤😊
Was that Eric Andre?
Just wow!!! Nothing will top this!
He is one with the Spice. Lisan Al Gaib
Oh my goodness. Conan just went for it. Man is unbelievable.
I want a set of sauces
Legendary. May Conan live forever
This man is a national treasure. His comedy saved my life and has made me a better person 👍🏽
I love Conan so much
Amazing episode.
I've never been so entertained by a hot ones episode. Conan is king!
6:55 17:10 19:28
The Great Dictator? at the end?
😂😂😂
A true showman
What an amazing finale
Conans the best 🤣🤣
Conan is a beast
Yes we here call that Buffalo stew.😮
I've never seen Sean laugh so much. What a Hot Sauce God Conan! Truly one of the best, if not at least the funniest, episodes ever.
Best fuking one yet i love conan
Conan is so unserious 😅
I need a doctor after watching this.
His final rant reminds me so much of Lemongrab!
This was the greatest episode of this show I've ever seen. My God Sean this is your Magnum opus.
Conan took this show and i love how Sean held his own too, Conan is a legendary legend.
This is the best episode I've seen on this show.
I went back and watched a really old episode and the difference in Sean's interviewing skills is simply astonishing. His professionalism and commitment to his work absolutely shines through. This is now my favorite Hot Ones episode hands down.
What an extremely annoying character, bizarre how fake tv personalities are
That was f..king epic what a character 😂
This has to be one of the best hot ones ever lol
for the first time i can remember sean was ousted by a guest. shoutout to conan, the greatest guest ever
Conan for the F..... Win;)
Dude I love this show but I’m begging the audio mixer to drop down the bgm
Conan a freak tho
best hot ones show ever
13:45 Phoebe Buffay energy
Funniest hot wings I’ve ever seen
Man i love conan 😂
Please tell me that you will interview Luke newton and Nicola Coughlan with the hot wings
This was just like Conan's remotes segments, but without the audience of course
It was so nice of Conan to have Sean on Hot Ones.
Conan is a precious gem of absurdity—god tier!
This is by far my favorite episode ever. Never before have. I laughed out loud at any of these videos. I’ve just always appreciated his quick wit.  And glad he appreciates. It was good to see him, at least start off very serious and taking it serious and not being a clown until. Of course, he was dying at the end.   My second favorite show is Lorde.
Conan's taste buds have retired long ago
Wow! Been watching for years! I know the burn of the gauntlet...Conan is wild! This episode has to be one of the top five, if not, THE top!
Absolut ledged. Conan is the funniest man alive. The timing, the acting, the words, the personality.  Best episode ever.
The last 5 minutes are pure gold
I suspect Conan's Irish red hair is able to absorb the spice. Like an unknown super power.
This is just incredible. Conan refuses to not go 10 levels above every other guest. He is the king of showbusiness.
Connan's first we feast with special guest Sean
He has a certain energy, I don't know what it  is
Bravoooo.  This is phenomenal. Conan never disappoints. 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼
An absolutely legendary episode. Grew up watching him. Thank you Conan for making me laugh for so many years.  Can’t wait for his new show on MAX. 🧡
😅😅😅😅To funny
Sometimes its not funny to watch its just weird. Its like Borat comedy.
I miss his late night show. He was the best.
Best episode yet Conan pure gold
This episode is the summit of the mountain. Hot Ones will never have an episode as energetic and comedic as this one.  Conan ruined every future episode by raising the bar clear to the heavens.
Madre de dios, this was such a wild ride to watch . . . Freakin' excellent! :D Enjoyed every single minute of this episode :D
Wow 😂😂😂
This was BY FAR the best episode ever. Conan is a freaking genius!
an absolute ICON.
New and much, much greater appreciation for Conan. Kudos 🤙🏻
Best Hot Ones yet!!!! We love you Conan!!!
This is. Mental 😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bring Jordan Schlensky!!!!!!!
F'n Legend!😂
He's a madman. I love it.
This really rolled off the rails in the second half, and I enjoyed it more and more every minute
Conan is unbridled chaos 😂😂😂
This was god tier.
please invite ryan gosling next season!!
Anyone who can take Da Bomb has my respect. Conan not only took it, he ran with it. Utterly impressive self-control.
This is what I expected Eric Andre to do when he was on the show 😂
Conan should try hot sauce on Haitian barbecue
I'm so proud to say that I was born on the same planet as Conan 🧡
That didn't go well
God bless Conan. I mean it 🧡🧡
Conan, thank you for decades of comedy. I remember the Late Night show in 2002, I was like 11 years old then and would sneak out just to watch the show. Love this man so much
That was the most beautiful chaos I've ever witnessed.
The moment Conan came on it became Conan's show.
Him bringing his own "doctor" as a prop was totally something I would've expected a Will Ferrell to do. Friggin' Conan!
"This is not a bit! This is your show! Don't say this is a bit!" is extremely good advice for anyone getting into entertainment right now. Podcasters, interviewers, comedians. Acknowledging a bit is a bit is a very fast way to tank the humor. Looking outside the comedy too much or too soon makes people feel self aware in an uncomfortable way. The same way he brings up "When the guest says 'you're not getting a good show', I see 200 souls leave 200 bodies". Don't tell people what they should or shouldn't be laughing at. Don't tell people where they are. Don't make them aware that you're trying so hard to be funny. Just be funny. Conan didn't yell and scream with a mouthful of milk and beg you to laugh, he expected you to.
CONAAAANNN!!! The Barbarian. Killing it always, awesome episode!!!
Conan is the hero we don’t deserve 😂
So many questions ... :D
He could have died
Im not sure Sean could have predicted this result....
Conan is the GOAT.
Gotta love Conan. Goofy af but down to earth as well 😂 Haven’t seen an episode this good in a while.
Can't imagine how red he will get
i had Da Bomb and it was so spicy i felt high, Conan took it like a champ.
Conan the Destroyer
Never laughed so hard in a hot ones episode. Conan you’re a living legend.
Best one so far. Conan was born to entertain. Amazing.
I’ve never watched a full Hot Ones, I’ve only watched clips on Instagram. This is the first one that when I saw a clip of it on Instagram I immediately looked it up on YouTube and watched the whole thing. Conan is the greatest
Him continuing to ask every time if he can keep the wings is peak comedy.
Watch Conan turn into Frank Reynolds in 24 minutes.
It's really uncommon to have so many people commenting that this was the best Hot Ones ever. I couldn't agree more. Conan is on a whole different level. I'm glad Dr Arroyo was there to save him from scoville poisoning...
Truly the greatest showman
Legend
The greatest ever!
Team coco!!!!! Bobby Lee and this!!!
How could Conan with his thin lips and Irish culture’s lack of hot spice, take the wings of death like a GOAT?!!!! Did he collapse and get taken to emergency? Conan is a comedic steamroller genius!
Conan didn't came as a guest, he came as a host and owner
It’s amazing how much he evolved from his early late show days. He still take comedic risks and is always making me laugh.  Love this guy. Leaving NBC was the best thing for him. It set him free.
They need to cast this man in every comedy
In The Simpsons, Homer drank wax so he could eat spicy chilli, maybe Conan did something similar.
Jesus Christ, Conan is the definition of "he's still got it" and probably will be for another thirty years, this is the most I've laughed at a guest appearance in ages
He’s like the old straight male version of Katya
Anyone that knows Conan, shouldn't have expected anything less...this was great.
BEST EVER!
This may be the greatest episode. And that's including Rudd.
Who would predict a "Charlie Rose Show with Chicken Wings" LOL.  Conan is pure fire!! Best Episode Ever
That was amazing 😂
watching his eye you can see the I regret drinking this
and THIS isnwhy hes a GOAT
Jordan Schlansky needs to do this
Funniest episode ever.
That might just be the best episode of Hot Ones ever !!!
Best episode ever!!  That’s what a great guest is all about!
All I can say, around that 23 min bit, that's gonna become a meme, LOL.
This is the greatest hot ones ive watched. Hands down
He has his own doctor like Hunter s Thompson
Awesome episode!! Made me want to see conan on killtony! Lol!
ow man, I bet he sh*ts lava the next day. Small price to pay to become a Legend
You finally got Conan on!!!! Yes!!!
I have never been so excited seeing a thumbnail. God bless Conan nobody can make you laugh the way he does he is so brilliant at his craft. This was the funniest hot ones episode yet - thank you for bringing Conan to the show and blessing us with his presence
This isnt hot ones, this is the Conan show 2.0 with the hot one's segment lol waiting for conan to go to commercial lol
I think that was my favorite.  Best one yet. ❤
Anything bad i  felt about him is gone. Respect!
This is the EXACT opposite of the DJ Khaled episode.
Insane
I don't think anyone told Conan the sauce was already on the wing
Best ever! Over the top.  Funny! 👍👍
BEST GUEST EVEEERRRRR!!!!!!
my favourite human conan. he did it again
the best hot ones interview of all time! Period! Exclamation point!!!! Conan for emperor!
what a great show.
lol i miss his show
Conan is amazing 😂
Best one ever. Cool! Fun! Thank you
Greatest showman in history, hands down! Conan is a national treasure and icon!
Whoa, Conan is a real pro entertainer.
HIS EYES ARE GLOWING! He’s drooling! I LOVE Conan!
If he doesn't have viewership of 1 billion on April 18th when those episodes drop on Max...
Best guest ever 😂
Smashed it
Best episode ever!
Conan is a beast! Thank you so much for this.
Brooooo lol. For someone that didn't need a fame bump and everyone already knows who he is...he fricken went for it. It was goofy but funny lol one of the best episodes
Conan is tougher than Gordon Ramsay now haha
One of the best shows I have seen. So, so funny!
That was wild
Loved the sky comment about Leno - “the other guy” 😂
would be a great episode if conan would just wipe his mouth
I've been waiting for this one!!!! Did not disappoint.
This is the most unhinged thing I have ever seen
couldnot take my eyes off the screen
Best episode ever
One of the biggest guests ever!
Hi. I was Brian Toledo.
Conan will never disappoint.  "I've never felt so alive" 😂😂😂
Prob the best one I’ve seen. “You go to a 4 year university” “uh, it was supposed to be.” LOL
He's the goat
Conan is a genius! I'm used to being the funniest person in the room, but he would totally DESTROY my spotlight.
“It’s up 2 degrees from the beginning of the show. No lie.” 😂
Huge fan of Conan 😅❤😂 love it.
Saw the thumbnail - CANNOT believe how fast i clicked on it. Absolute Legend! 👏
Always loved conans humor, its corny but wacky. He always makes the jokes about him even of the topics aren't about him
Isn't there something about redheads having a higher pain tolerance? 😂
Don't keep your wings, keep his wings so we can check if his wings actually has hot sauce on them 😂
*looking absolutely distraught* I Am Fine.
Something tells me it's so not fake 🤥
Best hot ones ever😂
Craziest but funniest episode by far
Conan O'Brien is a treasure
I've been watching Conan the year he debuted. He is thr penultimate of our weird. Love him forever
Conan is so great, guy’s a legend
🙌🙌🙌🙌
Thats real. Real funny . I had to pause it and go for a calm down smoke from laughing to hard.  .
If hes a doctor, im an astronaut.
“I don’t fear your wings man” was the diss that was never meant to be uttered but planet Conan brought it out of the ether. Such respect for the lunacy! Like watching a philosopher submerge into a hot sauce insanity! Golden!
Hands down, my favorite episode from this channel.
The true professional.
Conan the Barbarian! :D
That was the best episode of Hot Ones ever.
The rant at the end with the sauces slowly spilling on the table is marvelous 😂
"I'm used to no spice at all." *Proceeds to absolutely destroy every single sauce*
@23:00 gonna be a meme template calling it now
2 days, almost 5mil views.  says it all!
Best ever!!!!
Kids, dont take drugs.
"he's not a good doctor he's an affordable doctor" 😂 " you're not a real doctor are you? " ... " I should be" 😂 hilarious
what a show!!!!!!!!!!!!!
From his days working on The Simpsons Conan learned that he could pour wax into his mouth to make him immune to hot sauce.
Conan started lame, but it evolved.
Legend
My least favorite episode ever
One of the best episodes for sure 🎉
The spiciest sauce Conan had before this show is mayonnaise 💀
How can this show go on to another season?  This is the pinnacle!  Every other scheduled guest for next season is now spoiling themselves.
I bet he felt the heat in number two later. Dat pepper x burns when you lay some cables
Travelling but dumb so basically Karl Pilkington's 'idiot abroad'
I fucken love Conan O'Brien extremely funny😂😂😂😂
Ive watched alot of these and Conan handled these sauces better than anybody Ive seen .
I really want to follow up show called "Hot ones, the next day". Anytime I eat hot sauce, the next day is where the misery really starts
Came onto the show with no lips and ended it with lip fillers haha this episode was hilarious!! ❤
The doctor is actually a magician in LA who is swapping the bottles
I don't really watch tv or talk shows but this guy has always made me smile when i see him
This is hands down the best episode of hot ones I have ever seen... I'm a huge fan and have seen all of them
The first time Sean couldn't keep up with a guest. Gold!
This is the best destructive interview I've ever seen
Oh my. What a legend. Somewhat unhinged..always for entertainment.
O'Brien; you've done us proud. A true New Englander.
Legendary Showman
conan is truly the goat
👏👏👏
"What's wrong with me? Why can't I feel?" A God
This is the best one.
What is this. 😂
Conan got 4 million views in 2 days!
one of my favourite people of all time.
Conan is an American icon and this just proved he still has it and may be in the best form of his life. I admire him and how funny he is!
The GOAT
Conan is King.
He gonna be hating the next day 🌶️ 💩
This is by far the best hot ones episode
JESUS!!!!
This was the most annoying interview I've ever seen. 3/4's in and I can't watch anymore.
Conan:you can't stop me from being how i am....         🥰
Funny and utterly disgusting.  Im conflicted.
That, uh, was a VERY wild ride.
Best episode ever
Best episode ever.
Goat talk show host
He put the chicken wing in his pocket this guy here😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Team CoCO for life.
He is the greatest talk show host of all time!
Ahhh Conan your a treasure man
The scoville level is directly proportional to Conan's agitation level.
Call the wife! 😂 ugh I love him
Can't believe this idiot drank Da Bomb
Has someone checked on Conan lately, is he okay?
Every time Conan O'Brien opens his mouth, I hate that he's not running the Tonight Show. He's been ahead of the curve so long that he belongs in every generation.
Finland mentioned! Torille!
Conan is amazing
my ADHD king
I love that Conan is pure distilled unfiltered Chaos.  Shawn has such a hard time keeping to the interview and you can tell he's really enjoying the interview.  Great stuff.
All hail the king of hot sauce and the best talk show host love from 🇱🇰  And where is his damm award
Nothing will ever and I mean ever be better than this on this show! The show has now peaked, it's only down from this point.
this is why i love conan, this video is so full of life lessons if you were listning mixed with his humor and all, thats got to be the greatest episode ever ❤
Is he planning to sue them? It's like he's taking the wings for evidence or something.
took it like a champ, hats off.
Doctor doesn't know anything 😂  fake doc... funny show though
"I... *dry heaves* I think he puked... *dry heaves again*"
Other than SteveO pouring the last dab into his eye this is the craziest episode and I have a huge amount of respect for Conan! He made Gordon Ramsay look like a wimp
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lengdary
I don't get why he's putting the wings in his jacket. It makes no sense and it's not funny. It's kinda weird and creepy actually.
Conan’s hair is still amazing.
This was amazing
😂
I think there’s one that may have outdone coolio.
Can’t believe there wasn’t a question about Jordan Schlansky!
A new level has been opened by Conan....Sean said it a bunch of times...AMAZING....
Bought out shill eating wings. Go to Haiti again and enjoy it. PoS
Easily my favourite episode. Conan is awesome
i think this is the peak
This felt like a Rick Morty inter dimensional tv show
Sean Evans giving that John on the cover of Rubber Soul vibe.
If you have ever had da bomb youll realise how impressive Conan was when he ate the wing
Ive been laughing from third minute to the end. Haha
Conan the Barbarian...........
I absolutely love Conan Obrien
Youtube marketing is brutal hhhh
RAHHHHHH I love Conan so much bro. GOAT OF LATE NIGHT❤
Did DJ Khaled watch this??? 😂
Conan is one of the most hilarious people. Also super White.
Wow. He's committed. Crazy how he could keep it together. I have to assume he likes spicy food in real life.
#1 Hot Ones ever made, nobody can ever top this performance
Best episode till date 😂😂😂😂
This is episode is GOATED as soon as Conan walked onto the set.
Huge Jacked Man
This is the funniest one by far. Conan is an absolute legend!
Hugh Jackmannnnnnnnn
Hugh Jackman, Deadpool and Wolverine is coming out soon. Makes perfect sense.
i have not laughed harder watching Hot Ones in my life
That was the best one I’ve seen lol
Conan out here predicting the future deaths of american celebrities, what a legend
Hugh Jackman for hot ones!
A true blue performer - Conan O’Brien is THE guest to close this season!!
*wing drop*
One of the best ones ever
Yup! Conan is indeed the BEST!
Einfach so gut und unterhaltsam. 😄✌️
conan killed it as always
Pretty sure this show is a 2-parter, they just don't film the second part 😂
This is EVERYTHING
By far my favorite episode
21 minute mark onwards was some great Chris Farley energy :) Best episode of the show.. ever! and it is not even close.
Conan, over the top with the funny!
Unfortunately, this gave me PTSD from the horrible Kevin Hart episode.  "Comedians with "schticks" like this just are not funny.  Nothing natural, nothing authentic, nothing funny.  I am always amazed how these schtick guys are so popular.
My Goat
OK that was legendary and the most funny one I've in the Hot Ones.
Conando 😂😂
I loooove Conan's comedy style. He reminds me of my favorite comedian of all time, the late Robin Williams! Always a treat to see him be him!
Honestly,  Conan is the best ❤
HOT COCO!!!
The best one so far! What a piece of entertainment! 🙌
This show has been out forever and I've known about it. This is the first episode ive seen and i already know this is the best one. Conan O'Brien is the GOAT.
WHAT. A. PERFORMANCE! This guy is a pure entertainment monster. What a show of will to give viewers something to be astonished by.
There have been some amazing episodes but Ive never laughed out loud so many times! GOAT
dont know this man. huge respect.
Conan is gonna die on the toilet. In peak fire...Will he regret it...never
What a ride, great ending to the season
is he ok? lol
Ladies and Gentlemen,  Conan B'rien  What a man, what a character, what a legend.
Conan is a hero of planet Earth
Got to admit, the bottle got me
Sean where did you buy that jacket? It’s awesome.
What a legend
Conan certainly had some spicy poops after this.
this interview was destroyed
Where is Roland Duchene?
His commitment to the bit is so so good. Got me laughing in the airport. Thank u
Best guest ever!
This is the greatest anything ive ever seen
Conan is a true showman
I've been watching hot ones for years, this was the best guest and the best show for me. Thank you Conan, i laughed so hard!
Conan show right there
This might be my favorite Hot Ones episode ever!
this one and shaq is my favourite interviews
Best hot ones ever 😂
This is the reason Howard Stern named Conan his favorite guest of all time.  It's a must listen.
Conan: check the pulse Doctor: it's there
One of the funniest FWF ive ever seen.   Dude straight up drank the sauce, asking why he cant feel pain.
he was high
"You're not a doctor, are you?"  "I should be." 💀😁
This is why we love Conan!
can ewe have JIM CARREY??? PLEEEEEEEEEEASE
that is simply the best hot ones EVER
Conan's character is what separated him from the rest of the regular chat show hosts. Absolute legend.
Love Conan Forever ❤ Shares a bday with my daughter. It's hers now, Red.
I need to hear how Conan's follow up BM went o7
Bro is crashing out😂😂😂
At 9 minutes conan says the worst thing a guest can do is say this isn't going well to the audience. And 200 souls leave the guests' bodies.  If I was interviewing conan, id follow that up with, how do you "save" the show at that point?
Leave Conan alone !!! Lololol
Rockabilly O’Brien
Ok folks thats it, we got the absolute peak of this show. Best episode ever.
lol
That was fantastic! What a way to end the season.
Pure Savagery!!!
Conan is one of the greatest! he is always for the audience and his heart is in the right place :)
Well this episode was a little different 😂
I want Conans oh yeah as a ring tone
Conan being the funniest guest and exposing the fake SHU ratings of their sauces is too funny
Has Jay Leno done the hot ones? Conan just made another skit for his show with a doctor.
This is the greatest Hot Ones episode of all time lol!
This was amazing! That dedication is second to none!
He should have brought on Preparation H Raymond.  This is all time top 3 episodes of the show. Conan is a master entertainer.
Bruhhh Conan is the best!!!
This was fantastic 😂. I didnt know I'd have a favorite episode of this show. I do 😅
Love the way the good Dr would come in .. 😂😂😂 Conan will do ANYTHING for a laugh!❤
24:57- For this entire rant, Conan sounds just a bit like Rick Sanchez
Giving a 60+ yrs old irish man hot sauce is never good :D
Just found my new favorite episode of Hot Ones, mad respect, put Conan on the HOF wall
YES YES YES YES!! The Legend, the best host ever!
I don't know you could win Hot Ones, but Conan won Hot Ones.
I'm crying 😂 THE most amazing finale in history of Hot Ones.
At the beginning I thought, yes Irishman prepare to die,  on the seventh bottle I thought his grandparents must be Mexican... on the tenth bottle I though "what a gangster"
Connor O'Brien being himself for 25min only to get interrupted by good questions. Awesome
LEGENDARY CONAN
im not going to watch this show just for the fact that sean didnt want to get hot sauce on his suede jacket from conan. that suede jacket would have been  a great memorabilia.
oh my gag reflex.
Best. One. Ever.
You are not a doctor are you? - I should be.
BEST HOT ONES EPISODE! 😂 Conan never disappoints. One of the best comedians of our time!!!
23:00      Iam fine!  :D
One of the best hot ones episodes couldn't stop laughing 😂
Sean made a terrible mistake. He didn't invite Conan on the show, he invited the buffalo.
You've just seen the best episode of hot ones you'll ever see. Fantastic
That's the Catholic work ethic! I love it  Conan is one of the greats!
Conan!!! 😂😂😂
The Dr. Arroyo character is brilliant! Props to the actor for the straight faced perfect timing and delivery.
What an episode! The best one ever!
I have not laughed like that in a long time! 😂😂😂
Conan went right past the heat and went directly to insanity. And it was the greatest thing ever!! Along with the messiest and prolific outro message to the masses. This is why Conan is one of the most electrifying individuals in entertainment.
100% conan cheated with some stuff to numb the mouth like those tablets that make u not taste chillie spices etc...
Conan is an absolute maniac..
Did he drink a candle beforehand?
watching him mock the first 4 wings: ahh the arrogance before the fall  watching him lather in da bomb all over his face: i am witnessing the legend at work
I'm definitely watching Conan Must Go. XD
This is why Conan is still the greatest
3:05 isn't that called idiots abroad? I got better
So did he put lidocaine in his mouth to cheat the interview? That’s the only interesting question. Pretty boring otherwise,
Love this guy to the moon.
22:43 eyes of regret
For extra fun, watch his first show in 1993 and then flip back to this.
He is amazing. That end - i couldnt stop laughing. Also loved that he lowered our explanations with that I'm Irish and haven't had spice til 50 and then contrasted it with drinking sauce from the bottle, looking unbothered like a complete madlad!
Best show of First We Feast of all time.
So crazy hearing him sweat after decades of clean
Conan is a legend
What a legend! 👏 👏
Conan O'Brien. Probably my favorite entertainer ever?
Thats the most gangsta episode of hot ones youll ever see hands down.
Love your show❤. But for the first time in my life, I felt too Dutch to truly enjoy it. This was a lot😅😂
And like that, we have a new GOAT.
Still as good as he ever was, doesn't look like age dulled his wit by an inch.
I was expecting Conan to say, "the water buffalo and I made amends, and he was delicious."
What a legend,. Took it next level.
I think this is the first time... Or at least the first time if a minute that I went right back and watched the whole thing twice!
I'm not sure I've ever watched a more annoying person
When Trump?
I absolutely love Conan, this episode is up there with Shaq and Gordon Ramsey!!
:0
Conan has reached that little where he really doesn't care much anymore
haha yes Da Bomb is def a balk breaker
More guests should bring their own personal physician.
Wing drop - what a legend
Conan was on fire this whole interview.  The insistence on the Doctor being very affordable killed me.
Please be on GMM next 🙏
So we all agree that Conan killed Bea Arthur right?
This dude is by far the most talented late night host of all time, by a landslide.
Legend.
Came here just because of Conan
Extra AF
14:00 the best moment in a history of this show! Conan is a fckng GOAT! 😂😂
I thoroughly enjoyed this episode Conan is my favourite american person
Wow! Conan killed it! Wonder how that bathroom gonna be afterwards. 😂
Wow! Just wow! What showmanship!
When Conan turns into Jim Carrey..
Quality
I was born in 1981 Johnny Carson was on his way out I had no idea who he was to later David Letterman and Jay Leno were the late night entertainment that I was never able to stay up to watch until Conan came around then I will sneak up and watch Conan he stole the show this show went from being hot ones to Conan O'Brien's hot ones in one second he's amazing I love him
Best hot wings interview ever?  I think so.
Am I the only one clapping?
God Mode!
THE GOAT
Conan is such a legend!!!
Da bomb released a euphoria in Conan's soal that was spectacular to witness
Epic. Dude is one of the last TV greats.
Conan needs to dial down his comedy schist it’s gotten old and tired.
CONAN IS A ROCKSTAR
MAN CONAN IS THE GOAT. JUST LOVE THIS GUY.
best episode by faaaar. as far as I know the second best is miles behind
Conan 👏🏼👏🏼
I don't care what you say but NOTHING and NO one is going to top this episode! This is NR 1 with 100 Gold medals ❤😂😂😂
There's a reason why Conan O'brien is my therapist.
Conan would make a great Joker
Off the rip Conan is funny. Putting wings in his pocket for later😅
As a Jim Jefferies fan the constant references to April 18th were a little distracting! 😳😂
😂😂😂❤❤❤ yeah conan is best😊
The
Top 3 people i would love to see. David Tennent, MatPat, and Matt Smith.
This is the best hot ones episode ever. Unstoppable Conan O'Brien is unbelievable. I love is energy I love how the heat hits him and he becomes a better and better character every moment. This is the best hot ones I've ever watched I laughed and enjoyed every moment of this Conan O'Brien is such a performer. Conan O'Brien shows us the difference between the average man and a sheer performer. He is a performer he is a master of his career he is a master of the theater his attributes are amazing . Conan O'Brien is truly amazing. I enjoyed this video very much. I laughed and I enjoyed all the commentary.
I didn’t think I could like Conan more. What a gem! I’m 36 and I’ve been enjoying this guy for decades. It’s awesome!
This would be the greatest Hot Ones episodes of all time if it weren't for the thousands of innocent Irish people who died from ODing on spice via genetic relation to Conan.
CONNNNNAAAAANNNN ARRRRGGGHHHHH THIS IS THEEEEEE BESSSSSTTTTTTT EPISODE EVERRRRRRR!!!
Going to medschool in 1998 means he started 26 years ago. Being his doctor for 25 years menas he was his doctor since second year of med school XD
The man got powerbombed by a water buffalo. His threshold for pain must be quite high.
Had to be the finale, who could follow this? Absolute Genius, Sean was just along for ride, amazing composure tho, great episode!
I haven’t laughed this hard in a while
I watched this whole interview like 10 times lol
I just went to Wikipedia. How oon earth has Conan O'Brien not received a Mark Twain Award yet!?!?
The second half of that was comedy gold. 😂😂😂
conan may have lost the plot during this filming haha
one of the best episodes
Has any other guest given as much effort to the show as Conan did?  I bet the behind the scenes footage could be a whole extra episode. That was great.
By far the best episode ever, and I don’t think this can be topped, RIP hot ones
i can't imagine the trip to the toilet after this...
Conan’s makeups really holding up there
God said it first; "I Am That I Am"
That was frigging hilarious!!!! Great interview and I agree with the compliment to interviewer from the interviewee
Did he die after that?
Well, that was mental XD   Was starting to think they swapped the sauces out
I like how Conan is looking at the stethoscope at 19:15 and thinking, "He better not use that on me next".  EDIT: And then he did :D
Absolute legend, O'Brien is a badass.  😅
This is absolute madness, says a man who has never seen any of those hot sauces in his life but lived his entire life on spices and loved them to the core, and I know the feeling! Respect and Conan is the GOAT when it comes to entertainment!
Hilarious
That. Was awesome ❤
This is the funniest I have seen yet. I hope Conan has extra strength laundry detergent lol.
Top 5 guest of all time. I was not ready for it to be this good.
Simply exceptional 🎉
Pack it up, folks. It's all downhill from here. This episode will NEVER be topped.
I dunked chicken strips into a dish of Last Dab Pepper X... let's just say I had a bad night.
Christ almightly. Conan might be the best guest hes ever had
😮
Disturbingly soothing.
We need an update. How many ambulances did Conan need to leave the studio? I give him four years tops.
bruh humbled steve O
Maybe if he actually ate them...
Conan is the real deal! Ive Always enjoyed his comedy. He is a total pro! Glad the public always stuck with him!
was it a 4 year medical school? "it was supposed to be" lol good god
I think conan now has 4 years to live tops after all this hot sauce.
Legend
The most unfunny man in television
Man alive, he's still got the magic. This reminds me of staying up late every night over the summer to watch Conan in the late 90s. The dude is a master of his craft.
Love Conan. Some comedians are naturally funny and talented and he’s one of the few. Miss him on tv.
The 17:20 to 17:29 water to milk transition.  I'm not gonna lie, I'm feeling it.
Top 3 episodes EVER!
INSTANT CLASSIC
Everyone loves Conan for a reason. Nay, multiple reasons!!
LEGEND. 😂😂😂😂😂
Best one yet!!
This must be THE BEST hot wings interviews of all time. Conans' hot sauses tolerance alone was out of this world, but even without that, his well-thought  answers were amazing and really eye-opening.
Best hot ones.
Its just incredible ❤❤❤
CONAN IS THE GOAT!
The only comments I can think of?…?! Feel blasphemous 😮😂
Never laughed this much during one of these! Conan is the best!
This was the Best episode of Hot Ones I remember being a teenager and waiting  for Jay Leno to be over so I could watch Conan O'Brien we didn't have DVR back then if you wanted to watch it you had to stay up for it or hope that your VCR would record it that night God the 90's 😂 and every night it was worth it 😁👍
Conan is a fever dream
The only guest to get sauce on his face and hands even if overdone😂😂😂 thanks Conan 😊
Where did u go to medical school?  Doctor:  in 1998  Where  Doctor : out of state   You Should go   Haha
Got tears coming out laughing so hard. Hard to top this episode!
Best ep
Absolutely awesome
Someone please give Conan a bag or something to put the wings in.
Conan definitely upped the ante
14 year old me watching Conan: 🤣😂😂🤣 40 year old me watching Conan: 🤣😂🤣😂
This one is way better than episode with Gordon Ramsay. 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Team Coco all day
The next guest needs to be the calmest, most expressionless guest. That's the only way to be interesting if you're following Conan's act.
abt the worst thing ive seen ... bottteeddd
jordan schlansky next season
Conan is truly capable of doing anything to get a laugh
I'm convinced Conan has covid.
liiteraly had a smile on my face this whole episode
Conan GOAT. This episode deserves to be one of the most viewed.
I have not laughed this hard at a hot ones video. Legends
"They used to call it HBO but people found that too popular"😂😂😂😂😂
HANDS DOWN THE BEST!!!
That was great！
Hes the Goat!! 💯
Pure comedy gold. Ah, the madness! Conan is unbeatable in his game.
Christ Almighty, drooling chicken and milk and screaming wildly.
Im like 85% confident that Conan was actually vomiting at the end while giving his speech.   He wasnt trying to hit a home run, he ran up to the pitcher punched him in the face and took that ball to the fence and chucked it over himself.
Jesus, WILD doesn't even start to describe Conan's performance for this finale.. Bravo sir!
This has to be by far the very best episode ever 😂😂😂 Conan is such a comedian love 😂😂😂
it was just delightful enjoying Conan's presence on the hot ones ☺
I'm at 22:30 and I think Conan will die!
Show is getting fake these days
I usually watch these to have something on in the background.  This one held me in rapt attention the entire time.  I'm literally crying from laughing so hard.  Me and a bunch of other guys back in college used to get together at lunch and watch the previous night's Conan in the theatre on campus.  We informally dubbed ourselves the Alpha Beta Conan fraternity.  It's beautiful to see he hasn't lost a step in 20 years.
That's our Coco
a train wreck you can't look away from
bro. I will pay any amount of money to have that camera follow Conan for the rest of the day. Gimme that Snyder cut.
This may be the best episode ever
Wow Sean dropped the ball in this one.
Dude sold his soul
This is by far the best one yet. Who knew Conan was the funniest man alive?!
This was the best episode ever!! Conan is the goat! Great advertisement too, I really want to watch his show now
Bring conan back
Conan is the best. 24:57
CONAN IS A SAVAGE!! 🥵🥵🥵
Loved it from the beginning to the end!! Coco is always funny & will always be #1
Guest of the Year....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Best show so far
My face hurts from laughing so hard MY GOD I love Conan 😭😭😭 he is SO DUMB!
Conan is a comedy genius
This was really good.  I scanned the comments before I watched and expected a boring clown show.  What I got was a masterclass clown show.  The world is better for it.
💯💯💥💥
ledgendary!!
What Legend, even Jordan Schlanksy would be impressed.
Instant classic episode. Conan is the GOAT.  Thank you Conan, thank you Sean, and thank you Hot Ones crew for this gem that had me literally laughing out loud.
This episode was THE best possible promo for Conan's show on "Max"
Savvvvvvvvaaaaggge
Hands down the best episode of Hot Ones ever. The fact that Conan is equaly masterful on either side of an interview is just a surreal level of talent.  I'm pretty sure the sauce was intimidated 😅
Best one yet!!!
This was nothing short of brilliant
Apart from all the hilarious moments, I really appreciated the insight of what’s the worst thing a guest can do on a late show. It made perfect sense. 👍
I got a new favorite episode! 🤣👍👍👍
Funniest human alive or dead, wish he was my uncle 😊
Conan is a savage😂😂😂😂
I wanna see Conan act the part of Joker in Batman after watching this.
The classic first wing remark..dissapointing
Coco giving off serious “Rick” vibes at the end, he just had to burp while closing out the season 😆
Conan.  We love you❤
Just gotta love Conan
Conan so crazzyy🤣
How much cocane does this guy do? jesus. Drinking hot sauce out of a bottle.  This guy acts exectly the same as he did in the larry david show.   Insane yet Iconic.
Instant classic!
The thing I genuinely love about this supposed "frivolous" show is that some interviews are deep philosophical explorations of the art of acting one week, personal stories that influenced the guest's life the next or utter bonkers chaos, like this. Thank you Hot Ones for a sublime show!
Conan is truly a genius.
I give this family guy rating.
Jesus, what a show that was!
conan stuck in a toilet for a day after that 😂
Best guests ever
LISAN AL GHAIB!
The Man is THE MAN. Slaintè Mhath Conan
This is the best episode ever
Conan, you have Irish blood. That's why you can't feel anything.
Reaspect
This will never be topped. Ever. He also was the same funny Conan the entire time.
Huge fan of the show for years, but this was by far the best episode ever!
"Call the wife!" I'm cry laughing. 😆🥵🌶♨
This has got to be the most impressive episode of Hot Ones. Conan is a legend
I love Conan’s humor. Reminds me a bit of the old Simpson’s episodes.
Conon is such a pro, best in the business
now bring leno on and watch him melt
Wow. This is the best hot ones yet. I laughed the entire time!!
Thank you Conan for bringing me joy! Articulate, humorous and 100% committed.
😲just wow
does Conan need professional help
Didn't thought that after all these years someone will school Shaun on how to devour wings of death.... Conan as always you are THE GOAT!! As far as I can remember only Shia LaBeouf toped this...
I love Conan
He just took an absolute wrecking ball to this show didn't he😂😂
Won the hot sauce, wont the comedy, won the unexpected, won Hot ones. No one will ever top this 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Easily the best episode yet.
Tour de force in a comedy interview right here folks. What a pleasure to watch.
THE BEST
Conan is the ultimate entertainer, my gosh😅❤
People should quote Popeye more often 😂
Conan he tops them all
CONSUMATE PROFESSIONALS.
Best episode of Hot Ones ever!
Re loco mano
That was a master class in entertainment. Kudos to Sean for letting Conan go wild.   I love Conan. The last two weeks of his hosting The Tonight Show were probably the best late night shows ever. He totally let go and just had fun... so much like this Hot Ones interview.
The Euro Guy from late Night is the doctor LOL  "schtal-flukt"
Incredible, just incredible. What a legend.. Im stunned.
I now respect Conan O Brien
Conan is like The Hulk. The hotter the sauce the faster, louder, and funnier he gets. YOU CAN’T STOP ME 18:40
Hey, it's Tarja Halonen from Finland 😂 Greetings from Finland!
Wow. Im so surprised people are loving it 🤣 i couldn't even finish watching it because of how obnoxious he was, gross, cringe and constantly interrupting the host. You really dont need to be doing this much... Unpopular opinion i guess.  🤷‍♂️🫤
Where is the footage of the water buffalo incident?  Please internet I gotta see that
The best episode I have ever watched, AMAZING COMEDY! I cant believe he didn't break a sweat  on the first ones. Conan is brilliant.
The best episode. Ever.
This is why Conan will always be the GOAT of comedy!
The unedited version of this needs to be released.
i saved it in my calendar on my phone. conan is a national treasure  dont let a buffalo take him out!!!
Best interview yet
What an absolut beast
I dislike Conan Haiti O'brien. He's a joke. Tasteless food? Really?
He ended up with hot sauce on his tie 😂
That was very entertaining 😂 Conan one of the greats 🍗
Hmmm..... after watching this episode, I'm not sure what to think about Conan. He pushed so hard to be funny by not quite being funny...... well..... we'll see.
I guess redheads do have higher pain tolerance.
Instant classic! Conan the Goat!
yes
Classic conan, love him !
utter chaos and I loved it
Perhaps the greatest showman ever, who is having incredible IQ.  nothing like Conan O'Brien and no one will be ever be like him.
What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I feel?!
The second to last sauce was so unhinged Sean couldn’t even ask the question
God do I miss Conan in my life!
I kinda want to see that water buffalo clip. Maybe it's just me.
Conan is actually really funny compared to the current mainstream comedians imo! Always makes me laugh!
Conan been setting bars since the 90s...why stop now!! Dudes a beast
Conan was channeling his inner Robin Williams mixed with Rick.
That's gotta be the Best HOT ONES episode ever! Conan went all in! Friggin legend! 🤣🤣🤣
Finally  A watching worthy guest
I'M FINE. 😂
LEGEND!
Dr. Arroyo was such a great comic addition. He owned the show.
Now Conan Will Know, The  Importance of "Lux Bidet"
I just watched a 27 minute long video and it somehow felt like maybe 5 mesmerized minutes had passed.  I was absolutely enraptured the entire time, as per usual with Conan's work!   Conan was sent to our reality as a Chaotic Good servant of the Mad God Sheogorath and you can't change my mind 🤣
🤣👏
Muad'Dib!
This show was better when smaller celebrities would be invited. Now it's just the typical mainstream ones that get invited.
As usual  Conan is the real OG, no one of the talk shows hosts come even close to him.
Dr Arroyo reminds me of Dr Krieger from the show Archer.
I used to stay up past my bedtime as a kid to watch Conan in the 90’s. Now my three year old is cracking up watching him spin around on his chair. Conan O’Brien’s comedy is timeless.
its the first time i clap with them
first time I watched this show because of Conan.
Conan was amazing on this. But then again, he's always amazing.
There will never be another Conan,     This guy is a freaking legend, hope he lives forever.
The ring of fire must still be shining bright on Conan🤯
Pure gold👌
this is definitely my favorite episode. conan is such a legend. what a way to close the season. huge props to everyone involved!
I've watched him for 25 years and still not sure if he is truly like this or not lol 😂
Conan's eyes were getting more pink after every spicy wing he devoured. He's got me in tears 😂
I can't stop imagine Jordan being Conan's doctor during the interview 😅
"It was a four year medical school?" ... "It was supposed to be." One of my favorite improv lines I think.
I have never seen Conan before and ive also never been so encaculated by another person before. Insane. Cant wait to watch the show.
As a dude struggling in life this WAS REVOLUTIONARY for me. Thank you Conan❤❤❤
😅
Conan for real always delivers the silly!
He is crazy 😂
Imagine DJ Khaled getting thru his wings like this instead of quitting on wing 2.
Conan just randomly bringing his coke dealer onto the show is my favourite part 😂
Best guest EVER!!! I GUCKING LOVE CONAN lol
Conan is forever a legend ❤
Conan the Gastro-Barbarian
That was incredible.
Conan is mind-blowingly amazing! Best Hot Ones ever! 🤣😂🤯🔥
Love Conan, the true barbarian!  Always a killer man!
Is he using same make up as Trump? :-)
Jesus Christ Conan 😂
You can tell it was getting hotter by how chaotic he became
Every guest before & after this may be funny, but they’re all Meh compared to Conan.
He still got it
Pure chaos ❤😂😂😂
Conan is a legend
"I'm fine.  I'm perfectly... ****ing... fine."
Conan O'Brien at 23:49 , "what's funnier than Don Quijote?  Sancho Panza." 😂
What an amazing show of expertise in the showbizz industry, BRAVO!
this isn't Hot Ones featuring Conan O'Brien, this is Conan O'Brien featuring Hot Ones
Conan is the best of the best of the best of all time!!!
The best guest ever!!
Greatest episode yet!
Uhh mr c.... You have wings in yo pocket.
I knew this episode was going to be good
Nuts absolutely wild and amazingly entertaining 🎉🎉🎉
Love when The celebrities have so much fun on this
Conan is the best of them ALL!
Legend
Lol, only Conan could bring a person onto the show as purely a gag.
😂😂😂
CONAN LEGEND IN EVERYTHING HE DOES!!! BEST HOT ONES EVER 😂😂😂😂😂 CONAN CONAN CONAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sure hes funny, and ya he likes to control a bit ... but at the end of the day, the guy has no heat taste receptors.  Zero.  Thats the physical bit on our tongue that says 'thats spicey' called TRPV1 receptors.  They react to the capsaicin in peppers.  Some people have a lot of receptors and cant take heat at all, some have only a few of these receptors and enjoy heat ... like Sean.  Yes, it is a situation that can be conditioned, like little kids in Central and South American who chew peppers for lunch ... but if not conditioned, its a physical reaction to bio-parts.  Its hot or its not.  Its not a behavioural choice, its literally in the tastebuds.  Then there's Conan.  This shouldn't exist.  Even after he pours a puddle of Last Dabs 2 million scoville on that wing, he is still in conversational control, he is not in the slightest overwhelmed. Even people with a healthy capability to handle the heat has to gasp for breath and has a little trouble focusing on the question.  Not Conan.  The reaction was all for show.  He has zero TRPV1 receptors.  Look carefully at his face while he is acting out ... and you realize its just acting.  Hes fine, even normal for pictures after.  This is a thing, he should be studied.
performance of a lifetime
RIP I will watch this show in honor of the dead chickens. They made the sacrifice!
😂😂😂legend
What happen to the last dab  ..... he just dab halfway through the wings 😂😂😂😂😂
I feel so fortunate that I've been able to grow up with his career. This is easily the best episode. God bless Conan.
Bill Burr was in pain and another Bostonian did the candle Simpsons thingy and feels nothing
Conan is a savage!
im watching his show just because of that last speech
Let's all stop analyzing and just bow down to Conan.
Legend🙌🏼
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is peak young Boomer content and I honestly love it.
No one will ever top this interview 😂😂🔥🔥
The milk spilling out of his face as he delivers his plug is the funniest thing I've ever seen
The last "get" for Hot Ones is Taylor Swift, right?
Is it me or homeboy is slurring like he on one
Conan proves he is the best
Of course one of the best episodes in this series is the one with Conan
He slayed those wings You can finally say you earned the name Conan the conquer
9:32 vein about to pop 😅
😮😱🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😬
AWESOME. Norm would be proud of you Conan.
Is Dr. Arroyo even a real doctor? 😂
I wish he made Sona eat some of the hotter wings
Did he actually drink the last dab sauce????? Whaaaatt
I know he's dying!! I just ate 3 pieces of ghost pepper beef jerky to be on his level and I immediately regret it 😅🤞💯🥵 The man is a LEGEND
I really like Sean's Jacket lol
Is that Fred Armison playing Dr Arroyo???
Is this f'king real? If yes, Conan just beat Dax Shepard as the King of Hot Ones.
Conan got hurt enough thorough his career and swear to himself to never show his suffering.
Really cool that Joker 2 & 3 trailers dropped back to back😅😂
That was like watching Conan ride a water buffalo made of hot sauce..
As a occasional watcher of the show i have to say this is probably best quest i have ever seen in hot ones.
Purely Savage......  Have never seen a guest devour and dominate the sauces like this....  Conan is the Beast!!!
The Dr. Arroyo character is brilliant! Props to the actor for the straight faced perfect timing and delivery.
love conan!! <3 he's like my parasocial TV comedy uncle. :)
i absolutely lost it when the statoscope hit the tongue.
I have watched just about every episode, this is the greatest, i dont think anyone will ever top this.
LATE NIGHT GOAT
what a boss
I am still laughing ten minutes after watching this episode.
Always liked conan, Great sense of humor
This how you do it Dj Arab Attack (Khaled), not giving up (the definition of what you did)
After the last wing it felt like church 😂
61? time flies
It’s all about breaking patterns and shattering expectations. That’s what you have to master to be as good as Conan
The goat of talkshows.
Bring Joe Rogan next
Good.
I thought David Blaine eating the pepper with no reaction was great.  But Conan took it to a new unattainable height.
I hate him
THIS IS THE HOTTEST EPISODE EVER
Why can’t I feel-
This is one of the most unhinged things I've ever seen. No notes.
Show bis killed his tongue
Best hot ones in a long time! Wow! 😂😂😂
Conan came hungry for this one
Conan actually quoted the bible not even realizing it!  (1 Corinthians 15:10 ) But by the grace of God "I AM WHAT I AM", and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.  Popeye was inspired by true greatness thats forsure....
Conan is the GOAT!
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I don't know if it was just me, but this was kind of one of the most annoying guests I've ever seen. It was like being screamed at by Eago with a fancy hairdo
WOW LOL he's gone insane!!!!
Shane gillis in the new season, for the dawgs
14:03 just the neck tremble as he's saying this
day 7 of asking for guest pangina heals
Conando es la mera paipa 4eva!!!!
Best episode ever
I love how as it went on Conan became even more unhinged.
I’m so excited for his new show! Conan without borders was already a phenomenal success
Love Conan . 🙇🏻
love conan but he eats like a rabid gopher
This was genuinely insane. I haven’t laughed so much in a long while. 😂
Ghandi, Popeye and Conan is quite the list
Completely unhinged. Loved it.
This almost half an hour video felt like 5 minutes. Conan is extremely entertaining. What a legend.
I love Conan... His #1
Robin Williams vibe here
Conan is one of those rare ethereal gems to grace us with his presence and i'm definitely here for it.
Legendary
That's Conan for you ❤
Good ep but Conan was trying too hard
Did Conan just beat Sean on eating Hot Sauce? I thought Conan gonna quit after the second hot sauce level,   my oh my, The Legend Conan O'Brien
This is hands down the best hot ones episode and by far one of the best interviews ever
Best. Episode. Ever
This was amazing
One of the best episodes of Hot Ones ever
I’ve watch a lot of late night shows and nobody makes something out of nothing like Conan….. I have the upmost respect for people like him making things funny out of nothing, not everything works, but nobody else takes this much risk… Thank you Conan for all the laughs
Letterman, Stern, Conan, Evans... just on their game!☮️🙏🏻
We need Clarkson, Hammond and May to do this!
Thanks Conan!!!
I got to the end and just saw Da Bomb sauce dripping on the table, on Conan's side. I LOVED THIS!!!! :D
Conan is a National treasure. I haven't laughed that hard in AGES. Pure comedic genius ... nobody does it better.
Great episode!
2 days and pushing 5 million views... By far the best episode ever.
Best guest ever!
This felt like a classic Conan skit lol.
25:40 Conan: You’re not a doctor are you? Dr. Arroyo: I should be
Conan was probably destroying his bathroom for a couple of days...
We had a great time too 😂😂😂 thank you very much ❤❤❤
Does Conan remind anyone else of Rick Sanchez?
I love you Conan .
😆🤘
Conan has never been funny. He tries too hard!
Conan is a beast. A masterclass show
CONAN
By far the best one I’ve seen. Conan please never stop! 😂 He could host the show and just make fun of every guest and I’d never stop watching. 🎉
The spice must flow.
Best ever!!
Best hot ones ever... Conan is a beast
Conan just shows why old school harvard grads were made out of steel.. Im not anywhere near harvard quality btw..
Wow, that was hilarious!
this was my favorite so far
He is like 60
His travel shows can be the next Anthony Bourdain.
Major 'Rick' vibes from Conan towards the end there!
How TF lol XD
Oh my gosh. This may be his moment when he eclipsed all the other talent in history. Was feeling super Down about myself, but that helped me. Now I have a craving chicken wings
Conan the Legend!
Goat episode
FYUCKINGGOAT
Total legend and pro , still funny and interesting at the same time. His podcast also rocks
"You can't predict the future, unless it's the Simpsons".😂
07:43 That's one way of checking someone's pulse 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was the best show yet.
Conan is king 👑
This episode made me laugh the most. Conan is a LEGEND.
I had no idea, no idea at all that the Hot Ones guest that would absolutely crush the Wings of Death would be Conan O'Brien.  Virtually bullet proof and on full afterburner the whole interview.
Mans always on. Conan straight fuego🔥🔥🔥
Most people bite off more than they can chew..Conan chews more than he bites off
Most entertaining First we feast...EVER!
🐐
the realest mf at court the jester is
Conan is the funnest man alive 😂
So far the best hot ones ever made 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Conan is and always will be a legend. I've watched him since I was a kid, but big props to "Dr.  Arroyo" he played his role perfectly.
JFC... ***THAT*** was insane.
I love this man since day one, so why would him being on hot ones be any different. Hands down the best Hot ones guest, or was he the host? F. Brilliant.
Conan is truly the epitome of comedian and talk show host. I  was so disappointed when I found out my school (UC San Diego) made a promise to name one of our colleges (the so called Sixth College) after him for a day, as a prank, instead of permanently. Guess what, that Sixth College is still unnamed and will forever stand as a reminder of a huge missed opportunity for UCSD.
Funkin funny!
That’s the most natural color Conan’s face has ever had.
This is arguably the funniest and best episode ever. God that dude is hilarious.
Conan is the most underrated legendary comedy genius. I've been watching him from day 1. I knew he would be epic and own this show.
25:09  he turns into Rick Sanchez for about 6 seconds.
Was not expecting this hahah. Legendary episode!!
Please get John Waters on. That would be a show to remember.
Wow sean interviewing the greatest tv host of all time🔥 nicee
23:00 is comedy GOLD! He went full mad within seconds
Im genuinely scared watching this. This guy is freaking me out.
Glad Conan called out Sean as a top notch interviewer. Game recognizing game. Well deserved.
Everyone needs a crazy Irish friend
Conan O brien IS LATE NIGHT. Everyone else is or was just pretending.
The fact that cable cancelled this man to bring back the old guard was their biggest lost, but our biggest win.
wow one of the best!  I thought Kimmel did well!  Wow Conan Rocked it!
my lips hurt too much. thats all i wanted to say. Conan is a god.
This was by far one of the best if not the best episode of hot ones
Conan finally got his lips look fuller because of the hot sauce 👄hoping to hear about this in conaf podcast
THE BEST EPISODE OF ALLLL TIIIME!!! HAHAHA
I feared Conan would touch his eyes.
conan went full on to the left, and people didn't wanna watch that fiasco. just like john stewart, he wont apologize either.
Conan 👑
He is the fu## ing man
I dig Conan’s travel food vlog endeavor as long as it doesn’t end in an Anthony Bourdain. I can’t handle any more traumatic loss in my life
Legends.
Garlic weirdly as it sounds but garlic helps with spice adding some garlic
Well, here we have witnessed the viking inside Conan, and his mad commitment towards what he does. The man was truly 110%, and if I'm not wrong, Sean got a bit scared about, what is this mad man gonna do with the hot sauce bottle in his hand waving it around. Mad respect to Conan, stood through out the show, despite the fact that he is 61. His insights are something to treasure because those are words spoken after great pain he was enduring. I take a bow to you sir.
Conan stopped swallowing at 23:00
Dr Arroyo can get some pointers from Dr. Nick.
-Sean: "so we are filming the season finale." -Conan: "say less. Dorothy, find us parrots!"
He completely out did everyone before and to come!💯💪🏽
i wasnt bored even 1 second
Conan was never funny
I use to like Conan, but I'll be honest... this was just cringe worthy b/c he's trying so hard. Also seeing food fly out of his mouth is just gross... I'll pass on this one.
Why is there no footage of Conan actually eating a wing?
Honestly...I would like to know ALL the jobs Sean has turned down over these last several years....he would never disclose (hence many of the offers in my mind) but man....he is the holy grail of assets....period.
I have never seen Sean laugh this hard. This is an AMAZING episode. Not to be topped.
Conan: "Can I keep these?" Sean: "Yeah." Conan: *puts half-eaten wing in his coat pocket* Sean: "So anyways..."
"He's not a good doctor, he's a affordable one" 🤣🤣.
Yeah he’s the goat
He’s the only one I’ve seen take consistent respectable bites of each wing.
I’m laughing so hard my chest hurts
21:06 Conan goes full David Lynch blue velvet
God tier.
I'm crying 😂😂😂😂😂
conan is a genius 😭 what a special man
best hot ones of all-time. consey really earned that plug 😂😂😂
The man is a national treasure ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I say 20:55 is the most unhinged moment.
When he was talking about Max, I thought he was referring to Max Weinberg of the Max Weinberg 7 (his Late Night With Conan O'Brien band).
Just gonna suggest watching 20:55 one more time
This was hilarious from start to finish
This show peaked, Richard Ayoade
Best. Episode. So. Far.
The most surprising thing about Conan is even after 30 years he's still the same guy is was 30 years ago. It quite astonishing how he does it. I'm 20 and I can't even keep the energy from when I was 18. Hands down the greatest showman of all time...
Jesus Conan. This gave me mad anxiety. Great job
The GOAT Hot Ones guest!
Conan is Absolutey the GOAT of this show 😊
Ok that was maybe the best episode of Hot Ones ever
God I love this man.
conan and patrick stewart would act very well together in a show
love you ma broda
I don't know why Conan thought that he needs the props to be interesting? Like the pocket or the doctor?  I love Conan. I would listen to him reading the newspaper out loud. These theatrics were too much and unnecessary.
"You say this is pure pepper?" I'm dying
Knew Conan can be unhinged sometimes..But this...this is MADNESS
I honestly like him better on his own than I liked him on late night talk shows.
Conan is so effortlessly funny; one of the best to ever do it!
But why am I sweating????
Ryan Gosling's now wife just orgasmed on this episode.
The best episode ever lol
Dr. Arroyo is that guy who married a snake
Legendary perform right here
GOAT
The horron in shawns face says it all😅😅
Wow, I'm glad we had a great time.
This episode is the best episode
Best episode yet
I can't watch this...Conan is too funny, it hurts
WHAT IS THE POINT OF BEING ALIVE IF WE CANT DO THIS???!!!!
Capsaicin chemical burns on the face...
That water buffalo story had me dying
god i love conan
Sonia must’ve loved this!
Conan needs to take over for Colbert.
I used to watch him religiously in late 90’s and 00’s and haven’t seen him in years but man he’s still got it
i want Joey Tribbani next!!
i truly think that irish sweat is more reflective than any other
I think Conan witnessed the death of his wife before coming on the show and now is progressing into an anti hero from a Todd McFarlane comic. That's what this made me think of for some reason.
I’ve never seen Sean laugh so much! 🎉😂😂🎉
My man Connan has lost his mind.
This is probably the only time I genuinely laughed at hot ones
ALL TIME!
Conan is my favorite host. Truly an expert at his craft.
This is what they write history books about.
He's having a complete breakdown towards the end and I love it
conan wrote simpsons episodes and they were also sometimes spicy
Possibly the best episode in hot ones history!!!
Should have told him once that he cannot take a wing.
This was the most I've laughed in a long time. Master class of comedy again Conan.
Legend.
Conan face lol
4.5 million views in 2 days. That's the power of conan. NGL, not gonna get a celebrity like him in the next century. He is the Beethoven of all late night TV hosts. And absolute prodigy.
Hate him
Best guest ever. The drool was the kicker.
6:25 referring to the two late-90s talk show hosts as “Letterman” and “the other guy.”  That subject will always be a little raw for him.
Fkn legend. Been waiting for Conan to be on this show forever. As a kid I always watched  Conans late night way past bed time every night.
23:00 ❤❤❤❤❤❤
WHY DID DRINK THE LAST DAB? IS HE INSANE?!?
Conan O'Brien and John Oliver are the men that must be protected at all cost.
Conan is just the best, please.  Love from Brazil
👏👏👏👏👏👏
Not even a minute in and already told this generation that we're lame. Absolute Legend
This was completely insane.
I think we have a new Hot Ones Master. Sorry Steve-O.
#7 in trending .. the only celeb in his age group to be able achieve that in youtube nowadays
Is COB coming for your job Sean? lol. Jk. You’re da best! Irreplaceable my hot sauce guru!
I love this! Love Conan! Cried laughing!
Man conan o brien.. what a guy..
Wow! What a hot mess Conan was. This was awesome! 👏🏼
Conan = GGOAT Greatest guest of all time!
Best guest of all time.
good lord!
How can you top this!!???
Ok. Best guest wing performance ever.
😮slayed it! Whattttt. Oh boy. What an interesting hot sauce guest! Luv COB and Sean!😮
The milk spit take plug at the end was comedy genius.
He started saying that he grew up eating no spice and I though I was gonna see someone dying on camera.  I'M HONESTLY IMPRESSED AND MIND BLOWN!! 🤯🤯
Haha love Conan! Some of his mannerisms made me think of Chris Farley. He's totally feeling the pain in the bathroom the next morning lol but a small price to pay for great on the spot entertainment! 👍👍
lol honestly I think this needs to be the series finale, not the season. I don’t know anyone else who can top this 😂
conan looks like trump if his birth wasn't a demonisticism
It's no wonder why Conan is such a beloved human being but how he does it all is a mystery.
can you please get he irwins on here that would be fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Conan is simply the best. I don’t know how anyone can choose jimmy fallon or Kimmel or these other terrible late night hosts. The only exception for me is John Oliver on last week tonight but idk if he fits in that category
Best Guest ever. Hands down. I've watched them all as well.
Yep this is it
The bar is set way too high now.
Now get Jordan Schlansky on to lecture Sean about how each individual hot sauce is made
I am terrified and I respect this man
He's the best
I've never seen this annoying human more funny and interesting, respect.
Conan proves himself over and over again that he's one the greatest.
Conan is a legend, I'm honestly speechless.
Well, doubt he’ll I go to Haiti again
I never comment but best episode ever and forever he should be the new host
this is going to be hard to top
Wow, Conan nailed it!
😂😂😂 best hot ones ever! There's no one that compete w that unless they legit boof the wings 😂😂😂
Conan is a straight up legend
Can we all appreciate how little sean ages over time. These hot wings are slowly embalming him.
I love Conan so much man ❤
Conan’s comeback!! Actually Conans takeover
Conan is the heavyweight champ of Hot Ones right now!
Legend
we need conan on the jre trying smelling salts
I think Conan realized halfway through this interview that he had free reign and just went for it, since he was never able to fully let go on the talk show, and can’t do as many physicality bits on the podcast
so goood!
I miss his show , especially the travels one. He should definitely do a travel show
“I don’t fear your wings man.” I liked his read.
What a savage 🫡
Conan is iconic and continues to show why. Tips hat 🎉😂
He’s such a good performer very inspirational
I love that he has kept his ripcurl hair
Im assuming a dentist numbed his mouth ahead of time
Legend has it he's still on the toilet
You can see the concern in Sean's eyes after Conan drinks the last dab hahah
What a glorious guest. Unparalleled.
That vein next to his right eye bulged out more and more as the spice got spicier lol
Was that Max as his doctor?
Hahahaha the bottle tipped over just spilling sauce on the table!!!
I never would of thought Conan would breeze through the wings. He's the goat.
Conan is the funniest talk show host to ever do it. He’s just got a very special and personal approach to bringing the laughs. Never afraid to humiliate himself, be utterly outrageous and just put it out on the table for pure entertainment. And we reap all the benefits and rewards of him being his pure and unfiltered self. Thank you for the decades of comedy!
The last time I saw someone dab up the last wing like that was Coolio, and it didn’t end well
Conan got issues 😂😂
NBC still has to regret bringing Leno back.
Please wipe your face Conan!!!!🤢🤢
putting the wings in clear resin with a hot ones sign would be a cool souvenir.
Conan is really one of the last old school showbiz personalities. He has the incredible ability to simultaneously make it all about him, while still making it all about the guest. His capacity for putting entertainment first is almost unrivaled.  I bet his wife and kids put up with a lot.
I love Conan O'Brien.
That was awesome.
Humble at first, then obnoxious, and the fake doctor revealing. Everything is built perfectly. This is what you get from a best comedy writer.
Broke the show. Game is over, and he won. Bravo!
and now bring us Jordan!
conan for prezzz
I haven't laughed this hard at anything in a long time. Conan drinking the sauces had me in stitches
Conan has incredible control.
Now get Jay Leno
CONAN NO YOU'RE TOO IRISH FOR SPICY.
Absolutely hilarious
😂😂😂 Conan is the 🐐 🐐🐐
I am detriggered. Thank you conan
I am detriggered. Thank you conan
His hands are literally trembling as if he had Parkinson’s  and keeps his composure. I never thought he was funny. Still don’t. Regardless, after this, he should be unanimously adored by the entire human species. Good form Conan.
This episode had me in rolling xD
CONAN HUHUHU I MISSED U
Pure Showmanship! Best Episode Ever!
Conan is the GOAT
It’s just never gonna get better than this. YouTube is done, it’s over, close it up.
The only episode I watched more than twice.
Really, really love this! :)
This one was the most hilarious and inspiring 🤣🤣🤣 Conan is legendary. God bless him.
Yikes, that ad at the end was so freaking out of place, cringe, and almost killed the rest of the video..
Conan ia one of the best! A legend.
Conan is the king of comedy
The legend himself!
Best guest ever!
What in the ever loving F…….?
Next, Conan and his fave snacks
The best episode fr
Wow
Nice!
I've never seen a single one of these episodes, I came here because of Conan. Once again, not disappointed. Destructively chaotic and awesome!!
Best episode ever
Conan is awesome 👍
Conan’s face turned into a cherry tomato at the end
Underrated moment at 18:44: Conan quoting Popeye the sailor man. There's a clip (Popeye The Sailor - I Yam what I yam on Youtube) of a Popeyes cartoon of him fighting native American indians and it literally ends with Popeye punching an indian chief who was Ghandi in disguise for some reason. Insane hidden reference.
i dont remember asking for crazy but we got it!
Conan is the greatest late night talk show host ever
I have never laughed so much on a Hot Wings episode!  Conan, you DA MAN.
If somebody asks u "Who is Conan"? Show them this video. The whole 3 decades jammed into 30 minutes.. INCREDIBLE!!!
Who'd have ever thought that Conan O'Brien would absolutely decimate ten hotter and hotter spicy wings more that any other contestant in the history of the show. It's also great too that CO'B shopped his wardrobe at "Baby Gap" before the show.
Still waiting for Diego Luna to be a guest
Day 3 of asking for Bill Hader
An all time episode
Who's show was it really?
Lol.  I'd follow you to any network Conan.
Conan is the goat
😂😂 the wing drop got me running to the bathroom 😅
I love that he actually eats most or all of each wing on top of those self imposed dabs on the last 3 or 4 wings. Conan is the GOAT!
amazing
This isn't a Hot Ones video, this is a Conan Remote.
Yo Conan’s doctor is so sus 🤣👀
Conan is officially S tier. The S foor Spicey. This guy raised the bar for everyone and is a league of his own.
A masterclass in being the perfect hot ones guest.
Last part is madness... I love Conan!
Greatest Episode Ever!!
He took a swig of the deathly juice!
Top 3 hot ones episode ever
Did Conan just expose HotOnes?
This has been the best of all times. Or at least the craziest. Yeah... my god.
Best part was when he asked his dr to have a look at his guest. Literally the bravest thing I’ve ever seen dude is pouring da bomb on his wing!!!!
I don’t normally comment but this was one of the best episodes I’ve ever seen. 😂  let’s get Jelly Roll on the show!
CONAN Wrecked the show 😂‼️‼️
An Irishman chugging hot sauce is something I’d never thought I’d see
I was worried about Conan and his plain Irish palette going through the Wings of Death but he put Sean and all previous guests to shame!
The man is more than a legend. CONAN IS LOVED.❤❤❤
Power over spice is power over all + what a true masterclass from our fav 💯 Irish Star, and what a way to end this latest season of Hot Ones   Sean deserved all that genuine praise from the legend that's Conan, doubt anyone would go to those extremes, especially chugging them down just for good measure, lol
Gonna be hard for anyone else to do better than Conan did.
This was the best ever episode, no contest. Absolute class act.
I want Conan to lead me into Battle!
The Simpsons stopped being funny when Conan left as a writer
I'll be honest, not a fan of this one. He was a bit much...to me.
Conan is the King-Goat, Spread the word.
One of the best episode ever!
Only Conan can make a great show 10 times better
Nothing could have prepared me for this episode. To quote Sean, “Incredible”
How did he do that with Da Bomb
This is legitimately the best hot ones interview of all time, i don't know who can actually top this.
Did anyone notice that in minute 23:25 the bottles still are perfectly standing in line and are laying and dripping hot sauce in the following frame? Who placed the bottles this way, sean Evans? 😂
This is the first time I ACTUALLY cried laughing that i can remember. These comments kept it rolling, too!
I've never read a more sheeple title. Who cares?
Conan finally got a new jacket and instead of patches being on the inside of this one it’s chicken 😆
No wonder why it took years to get him on! Worth every second! He delivered!
Conan is the man jajaaajajjaha
Our guy Sean killing it with the questions. These back to back @4:18 and again @5:56. Two questions I have always wondered. Conan can honestly make nearly anything funny somehow. The remotes, and those old Conan in the office episodes were fantastic. That's how we got Sona to occur regularly as talent! She was the funniest on those office tour videos.
He's going to regret that later once he's on the toilet.
What a nut lol
Conan is raw chaos and I love it
This show has been amazing for years and yet nothing comes close to what I have just watched.
Conan truly got lost in the sauce.
Conan should have asked about the PronStar
Just epppppic. Conan is one of the comedy GOATs.
This is the best interview ever on Hot Ones!
Easily my favorite episode yet 😂
(disclaimer: this is my dad's account. I don't wanna log into mine cause I'm lazy. I don't think I'll say anything worth getting me banned. I'll be nice.)  HBO is a recognizable title. It's been around for a hot minute and referenced countless times. "HBO Max" implies the max potential of HBO. "Max" implies ME BIG , ME STRONG.   Conan is right as always (except for those times I didn't see)
I yam what i yam. Love yah conan!
Why do they sit so far apart?
I wanna see Walton Goggins!
Can we have professors teach like Conan 23:51
"The Doc, is my wrestling manager."
Man found his genius again
Conan is the king of Hot Ones.
THIS IS MY FAVORITE EPISODE! ❤❤
Leave to Conan to completely no sell the entire line up of wings, just to go off the rails at the very end. 😂
Conan your my hero😂
Amazing show!
23:00 is maybe the funniest cut to reaction shot of all time
Conan and Dr. Krieger. What a pair!
My man turned into Rick Sanchez at the end!
This is the most masterful comedic performance involving pain ive ever seen in my entire life.  You can tell he feels it all.  Madlab... Bravo Conan.
This tugged on my heart strings quite a bit... My best friend in the whole world is in the hospital dying of heart failure... her birthday is also April 18th, she's only been given a day or so at most... but she's really trying to make it to her birthday this Thursday(only her 33rd), and I didn't know Conan's was that same date until just now watching the beginning.  She loves Hot Ones, and so while I was visiting, I came across this episode and texted her the link to watch.  With that said... this episode really cheered us up.  Conan is an amazing talent!  Thank you for this, from both of us ❤️
Conan is a CHAD!
Just watched the Steve Martin Documentary and I have to say I see a little bit of him in every comic after him including Conan!
Conan is like the Joker of Hot Ones 😂
Wow did Conan just become king of the mountain 😮😮😮
Conan is the bomb lover it
I have watched Conan for years and maybe I am not remembering it all correctly but he really did go insane by the end of it
Amazing
Soon his 61's birthday, this guy have whole energy like he's in 20's
Why are these guys sitting a mile apart?
Technically and objectively the best episode in the entire series!
This was a masterpiece, by a true genius
conan is great
Best episode in years!
Conan died,  but I think it was a good plug overall.
my God that was a good episode. The best. Legend.
Conan also has a dope jacket but doesn't give af
One of the best yet.
I PRAYED FOR THIS
What. An. Animal.
Conan will always be one of the greats
Haven't watched this show in years. Just kinda moved on. Saw Conan as a guest and knew I couldn't miss it.  This is hands down the best Hot Ones interview. Don't know how you can top this. Conan is a nation treasure and Sean is an unbeatable host.
Greatest epIsolde ever
"I'm fine!!"
What a legend 💙
This is the first really seriously funny one I've seen in a long time.
Some of the best, if not the best era, of the simpsons was when this man was on the writing team.
Best. Show. Ever. Might as well quit now.
the 22:25 moment of Shawn's guttural "ohmygod" was hilarious he was seriously shocked haha
Absolutely Brilliant!
Sugar. Honey. Ice -t.... did he just drink the bottle of hot sauce.
Greatest episode ever
If you are a certain age, Conan has always been our leader. This video is proof. I didn’t see the end though. Hope he didn’t go all out for a laugh.
THIS. IS. THE. PINNACLE.
Miss Conan the jimmies need to go
I’m so thoroughly impressed with this man. He is a true entertainer. You just witnessed greatness.
Man that brings back the memories. It was just  like the first time I watched Conan O'Brian over 20 some years ago.
We all know Conan had the water buffalo offed…
Conan is a gem!
I'm scared of this guy
i thought plugs were at the end
Go back to a single table
Conan absolutely ruled - shocking for a 100% Irishman! How did his lips not literally ignite?!
The best episode ever! Conan the interview show goat! Bravo🎉
What a beast!
When asked about how he is with spicy foods, I thought Conan was going to say something like “salt is too spicy”!
I saved this episode under my “Science Rules” list 🔥
I have my 1 million scoville plus hot sauces I light myself of fire with sometimes. But, watching Conan I was amazed and feeling the pain with him. Taking a spoonful amount of the hottest stuff and maintaining some composure. Truly, impressive.
Conan does not disappoint, the absolute GOAT
I was watching this on Roku and had to pull it up on my PC just to comment; This is my absolutely favorite episode, maybe even video on all of youtube! SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS!
this was GOLD
Best to ever do it.
Best episode of Hot Ones ever.  Conan has not failed since '93.
This is IT. THE Best Hot Ones EVER!!!!! Only Conan could deliver it like this. There is NO substitute. Conan is a hot sauce BARBARIAN!!!
legend
1:37 "He's been my doctor for 25 years... where'd you go to medical school?"  "In 1998" 😂
he went so hard at this, moved past cringe pretty quickly, and then just made me subscribe to Max just because of the dedication, wow
. Father fricken figure of the milky way
7:00 - Conan complimenting Sean about his interviewing skills.
He drank Da Bomb!!! What is going on? Legend. Awesome show.
best episode ever!!!!!!! nipp rubbing an sauce to the face like aftershave!!!!!!
Conan is wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiild
So, conan killed bea arthur?
Hands down best episode of all time x 1000!!!!! That will forever be the best one for the rest of time. No one could possibly Come close to beating that performance from Conan! Long live the Cone Master of Comedy!!!
By far the funniest late night host ever
This was the greatest hot ones guest of all time.
Conan you are GOAT.
😅😂😂😂😂
what an ABSOLUTE LEGEND
Is this Jimmy Fallon
i was expecting this to be great... but Conan just leveled it up every minute of the show.. i can't think of anything funnier at the moment
Starting off calm and subdued.....*time bomb activated...also the foreshadowing of Conan talking about making something funny....
For some reason, I felt they were gonna play jurassic music😅
This episode rivals Ramsay 😂. One of the best, way to end a season!
Legendary. He is HIM. He is A LEGEND.
Conan is one of the realist comedians out there doesn’t even need to have material his mind just spits out funny
I've never seen Sean Evans in so much pain! You could see his eyes watering. If Conan really pulled this off, then I feel kinda bad for him.  He's such a jokester, I don't think anyone will believe he didn't get a little help from fentanyl before the show.
Probably the best thing I have ever seen.
His commitment to a bit is godlike. Dope to see Conan on the front page again
Conan O' Brien is a national treasure. I laughed too hard at this.
Conan is a LEGEND!
THE BEST EPISODE.   CONAN YOU ROCK!!!!
Absolute beast!
I pulled a muscle laughing so hard!! Best show ever!!!!!
Ok ok, I'll watch your travel show... jeesh. I'm 39 y/o.. i love you, conan.
This was SO GOOD
best talk show host HANDS DOWN! loved everything about this man, but holyyyyy. This episode i did not expect and im glad we got to witness this. Fucken love you Conan O'brien 😂 one of my fav episodes so far
AMAZING!!! Was excited to see this video in my feed and expected it would be good but it was unlike any other episode and BY FAR MY FAVOURITE EPISODE EVER!!!!
Rick Sanchez!
Conan is really exuding that "middle school boy doing food challenges in the cafeteria" energy in this one
Looking at how much hot sauce Conan used, I started sweating 😂
Best one yet
Funniest episode I’ve seen. I love Conan and his dedication to our entertainment.
BEST. EPISODE. EVER.
Conan is going to have blisters on his fingers and face.
Conan is so so so aggressively unfunny. Finding norm macdonald was the only good thing he ever did.
By far the most disturbing things I’ve ever seen on this show.
I knew Conan was crazy and love his shows! I never thought he was this crazy. Second time watching this again 😂😂😂
Conan's great! I used to stay up late in my teen just to watch the guy. Every weekday is a great show especially his monolog... He is impromptu and not afraid to go with the crowds response...
Conan is the man
You will need a hotter sauce 😂
The best episode 🔥🔥🔥
they should keep a copy of this interview in the national archives. lol!
Oh my god hes a madman and i love him even more now. This was the best episode ever, i laughed so much
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
He certainly took that sauce like a champ.
Amazing! We need Paul Rudd and Conan back on together with Sean . If anyone knows what Paul would do to  Conan every time he came on the show they would know this needs to happen with hot ones
Wow, That actually made me laugh! Great episode!
One of the best
Oh my goodness. I laughed so hard. So. Hard. That's one of the funniest things I have seen in a long time.
The only funny late show host in the last 15 years.
what a beast. This was prob my fav episode.
Conan's core body temperature going up 2 degrees is subtly the best part of this. That wasn't a bit, it was life.
Funny interview🤣😂😅
Conan has been making me laugh my whole life.
Conan is the MAN!!!
it is just good to see him  again. never liked him.  i miss his pull the needle and thread through the hips routine.  Sweet Chariot and or prize fighter.  I hope he shows himself being  thrown by the water buffalo.  i was impressed.   god bless  conanan
Conan and I share the same birthday
this has been the greatest episode to date
Haha what a king
This is easily the funniest episode of hot ones ever
CONAN EPISODE!!! Instantly my favorite episode of all time 😊
90's Late Night Conan got me through Middle, High School, & College. I wish I could tell Conan that from the The Simpsons on, he is responsible for making me laugh myself right out of many Depressive episodes and tough times that laugh that Life kept throwing at me. Love him so much! 🥺🤧
Dear lord, that was gut bustingly funny. Amazing showing carrot head.
Conan is a treasure.
!!!!! 🤣this is literally my new favorite episode ever 😂 i’ve always been a Conan fan
"This isn't affecting me at all!" As his face melts off is the best thing I've ever seen. Conan is the best.
Greatest of all time
Throughout all the episodes I've watched, I've never cringed harder than watching Conan *drink* the last Pepper X sauce. Even when Rachael Ray did it, Conan did it better.
BEST EPISODE EVER! I love Conan and watched his very first show and was a fan ever since. Just a genuinely funny and smart guy. Congrats on the props from Conan, Sean it had to feel amazing.
One of the best episodes in the long time!
Dr. Arroyo’s “it’s there” is an all-time underrated line
This entire interview was a bit 😂😂😂 Hilarious 😂 Love Conan. He’s the only good late night host in the last decade where the “comic” hosts are jaded by political agenda 👍
The 🐐
The hotter the wings get, the more Conan becomes Billy Crystal.  (Don't believe me?  Watch it again)
Loved this! Thank you so much.
Conan is the Lisan Al Gaib of Hot Ones.
"I'd lean in and I'd say like 'I bet you live 4 more years, tops.  I remember I said that to Bea Arthur, and  I think she made it 3 years and 11 months."
This is just like... the opposite of depression really. This is how you know the mind manifests itself into the body.
Can you please.... Please Please PLEASE... get Ciara from the try channel on your show!!  Nothing phases her! Please get her...  And then maybe Dermot or Justine! They're Irish too..  It's for science!!!
wow
RIP Conan
That wasnt a funny bit he was doing, that was how he deals with the pain of the pepper lol
Alpha
best episode ever
Ugh
It's nice to see late night talk shows like The Tonight Show fall into obscurity and outdatedness and Conan redeeming himself like a boss on YouTube and the internet -- his perseverance and commitment to getting stronger, and stronger at his craft really earned his place in our feeds. Long-time supporter here.
That is so impressive. That’s kind of insane. Hot sauce at those levels could induce heart attacks in some people and he just takes it. 🫣
Thanks for finally having Conan. Legend man.
Might as well call it a show, that was tops
There is no way
"HAITI" He is a nice guy, his comic timing is unique compared to other late night shows host I always thought he was kinda neutral guy when it comes to politics but when blindly bashed Trump and said Haiti is already great and now we see what's happening there it shows us that sometimes we  hate a guy so much that even if he's right we just ignore the facts just to bash him. I hope people vote carefully this year by doing their own research rather than in the influence of some celebrities.
I'M FINE!
I’m gonna subscribe to max just to see Conan. My god man. Hilarious
A wing drop well earned 🙌
..look a little like the Joker just sat down at that table to be interviewed.
New best episode!!!!
The ending was absolutely histerical and a little gross with all of the drooling. 🤣 Sean cracking up so hard was also wonderful.
Best one yet
Was it a 4 year medical school? It was supposed to be.
You've earned a comment
The funniest man alive. Amazing interview
Conan always refers to his shows as “we.”
Platinum 🤣🤣🤣
Best hot ones ever!  I'm going play this one on repeat. Conan is the man!
G.O.A.T.
Thee Best Hot Ones Ever!
No one is ever going to top this. Even if you chugged every single bottle you would just be a try-hard. What a LEGEND
jesus dude this is the best episode by miles, absolutely hilarious. conan is the goat
I'm INSPIRED with the SPEECH! CALL THE WIFE! *Drinks milk*... Man you gotta love Conan! One of a KIND! Like the funniest entertainers ever list... Conan HAS to be in there alongside others like the late Robin Williams! JUST SO EXPONENTIAL class in Comedy! hahaha Man, I'm laughing so hard in the middle of the night of 2am! Goodness! BRAVO!
Conan definitely took a tongue depressant
That was crazy and funny asf... 😂
What a beast! Conan is wonderful in so many ways.
Why shouldn’t this episode be nominated for an Emmy
You're gonna feel it when it comes out the other end, CoCo.
Conan is an animal!
Season 23? How long are these seasons? 2 weeks?
The Era of Conan’s Bruise is my favorite era 😂
Conan was a great guest, and that doctor was a funnier bit than it had any right to be. So dumb, lol.
He's not human. He isnt sweating.
Best episode
i LOVE Conan, he is the best
One of the things I like most about this show is that once in awhile you get introduced to a great new artist ..this Corban guy was really funny. Great interview Sean!
God i love Conan hes truly amazing
Conan have so much for this
Not sure when this was filmed but is Conan still with us?
This was the absolutely best. Conan. Is a beast.
conan is one of my favorite human
I BET!! (and I mean in all caps) I BET THIS IS THEEE BEST AND MOST FUN GUEST SEAN HAS EVERR... AND I MEAN EVER BROUGHT ON THE SHOW!!!   This also shows how great of a host Conan is as he knows EVERYTHING a host would want from a guest and he gave that to in its full to Sean. Hats off!! (Rather Wing drop)
I like how he's yelling about being a professional, yet covered in hot sauce, drool, chicken, and milk.
Conan talks about how jumping on the buffalo was an obvious mistake in retrospect... then proceeds to chug hot sauce "for the show" as if he's learned anything at all. =P
I can't lie, this was really painful to watch. Conan is a beast. haha
This is one of the funniest things ive ever seen
Legendary episode and great topper for the season.  I love how Sean was so overwhelmed by Conan on the second to last sauce that he didn't even ask a question.
Absolutely perfect season finale.
WOW! Seen every episode. This may become my all time favorite.🎉
You’re watching the Conan Show with guest Hot Ones
i sincerely hope those wings Conan put in his pocket end up on ebay for $50,000 a piece
I've always liked Hot ones and this is the best episode yet. Conan O'Brien is still reaching his prime, his comedy is addictive.
This felt like Tom Brady owning a rookie QB.
This is probably there with the Gordan Ramsey episodes as the GOAT episodes of this show. Laughed all the way through and CAN’T BELIEVE he destroyed those sauces 😂
"You're not a doctor, are you?" "I should be"  Comedy gold
The hair... How does he do it?
"Alexa, what is the precise opposite of David Blaine on Hot Ones?"
Invite Fletcher please.
For sure one of the best episodes right next to Shaq and Edris Elba
This. Was. AMAZING!
If i was a woman id have conan's baby just to keep the blood line alive
I was screaming stop the whole last half 😭😭😭😭 I’m so worried for him! 😂😂😂
😆 his shoutout to don quixote
Conan traveling is the best thing I have ever seen, I have literally watched his old remotes over and over…..
Incredible episode. probs the best one yet
Like. A. Boss.
18:40 I just want to see Conan cast as the joker now
The jokes and running gags made me laugh.   When Conan was talking about Podcasts and it cut to an image of him wearing the exact same jacket almost killed me.
Conan NEVER disappoints
Best to ever do it
Hilarious! As unhinged as me!!!!
I have never ever laughed this much, during a hot ones elisode loool   "Why can't I feel?"  "IIII'M FINE" 😂 What a mad man ❤
I mean... do you just cancel the show now? What's the point of going on when you've reached the highest peak you'll ever climb?
Conan Is my favorite person
One word: Showman.
I've watched many of these episodes. None this season yet, but when I saw Conan, I was excited to see it. God, this was great. It's definitely the funniest one, overall, that I've seen. I just hope he didn't have a heart attack after drinking those sauces, because I don't trust that doctor.
I love Conan. He’s so hilarious. He seems to also be a total mensch.
the bit at 17:29 has me absolutely dying i cant stop watching it
The background music is so much more dramatic than the content 🤣 Conan is a masterclass at making what might be serious so lighthearted
Top tier! Unexpected masterpiece. Couldn’t ask for a better finale!
If you are a Hot Ones fan like myself you know that this is the most insane one ever! Conan is the man! 🤯🤯🤯🤯 Kudos Sean.
Conan is eating the wings like it's dipped in ice. Meanwhile I'm sitting here sweating.
Man you are bringing my favorite people on the show!! this is great. Pitching idea: bring voice actors to react as their characters
ALL HAIL SPICE LORD CONAN
Conan I looove yooouu!! Watching this 2nd time. Too good only conans lips are getting red. G.O.A.T
Conan clearly coated his tongue in wax. He is gonna be feeling this for days.
He ends it with a great inspirational speech lol
I didn't find this funny at all. Maybe, I'm alone in thinking that, but he's been funnier.
Wow. Conan is an absolute KING. National treasure freal. True entertainer. Doesn’t compare. Literally killed it
Why are there two tables? Do they realize two people can sit at the same table?
Hilarious 😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂 @22:30 it just keeps getting better 😂
Epic.  Wish they'd dedicated a few shots to Sean suffering as he tried to match Conan's moves with the hot sauce.  I notice he drew the line at not washing his hands in the 2nd hottest sauce.
I've never seen Sean scared... till today
This is it! The series peaked here! Nothing can ever top this!
the constant "Dr.Arroyo come over here please" is peak comedy truly lol
Amazing show ! Conan was great ! A classic !
holyfuckingshit!!! this is the craziest thing i've ever seen
Lol so many laughs😂 this is the best episode haha
great episode
Conan is on the sauces like that dude in the bathroom at 4am
That has to be the best episode yet.
THE G.O.A.T !
I love that he came onto the show and made it feel like another silly conan sketch/block. while also giving gratitude. best guest this season?
Wow...just wow. GOAT.
Legend
Drinks hot sauce hahah brilliant
I went to bonnaroo in 2010 and connan was there, but i didnt go see him. I feel like the older i get, the more he grows on me. Maybe i missed out.
Haha Conan O’Brien comedy is unparalleled lol
😂😂😂😂 funniest moment on hot ones history 20:14
By far the best episode.
Best one ever!!!
Wow
That was hands down the best Hot Ones of all time. Another classic for the history books, Conan.
Wow I can honestly say I've never laughed so hard for a hot ones interview and actually came away with something at the end
Conan is the best!
Conan best ever
Conan brought it
Please do jocko wilink
I’m scared
Best hot wings ever
Conan O’Brien show featuring The Hot Ones
This is the best episode I've ever seen. Conan is a powerhouse even after all these years.
Best episode ever 😮😅😂
As someone who isn't a fan of Conan, this is easily one of my favorite Hot Ones ever 😂
"Tastless" irish food. Dumb
Insane
This is one of the best and funniest hot ones so far 😂 imagine Conan become host of hot ones, it will be a wild show
This is how you plug whatever you're dropping next people! What an episode!
The Best of our Generation ❤
Legend.
This is why Conan is the GOAT. When he goes in, he does not stop.
This is GOAT on this show.
The end there ------- greatest comedic performance ever caught on film. That's a wrap on this show, no other guest will ever top the time that Conan graced this set with his genius.  Conan O'Brien must go (destroy YouTube and all content within).  And I'm going to go sign up for max.
I need that jacket
Conan was my second ever crush in my life (first was Johnny Depp) but he’s still so pretty as ever ❤❤
I knew I liked Conan, but I didnt know I loved Conan...
i've seen guests fail this, seen them go through without any pain, bring remedies, do stunts with the sauces, etc etc, i have not seen anyone do that while clearly feeling every single crazy thing he does
Conan was on watch by the military after this effort...his Gastrointestinal Tract definitely became a literal weapon of mass destruction....😂
GOAT 🙌🏻
No one has ever drank hot sauce on the show😂
Best show yet. So many laughs.
now that how you market HAHAHHAHAH
Dr Arroyo checking Conans pulse and saying “it’s there” 😂
I think this might be my new favorite episode next to the RZA and Paul Banks episode
Legendary.
May be the least funny episode. Overactor...
Conan is a Badass!!
Conan is the funniest person on earth! 😂 He’s only proved it again today.
That "out of state" answer from the "doctor", was unexpectedly, very funny.
Can’t remember the last time I LOLed so much at an episode. 😂😂😂😂😂
Dr arroyo is very good, very inexpensive 😂😂😅 7:40  This is when the laughs started rolling for me. Fantastic episode 👏🏽
Conan is a fu@$ing legend!!!!  That guy must be protected at all cost  The final question ….  Holy Jesus that guy was in pure inspiration and true  Don Quijote and Sancho Panza   He truly is a brilliant man
Love Conan!
That was comedy gold !
Made MY eyes water.
This just inadvertently created a Hot Ones universe in which Dave Grohl and Conan have an epic rivalry about fear and life.
Need to remove the jingle music in the background, it makes the video feel like it's about to end as it's the kind of music you put behind a 2-3 minute clip advertising a college program. It makes me feel anxious. Let it be a long form interview.
The first time a guest has truly pulled one over on Sean?
Best one ever!
Conan is still the greatest 😂
The florescent finger tips 😂
Conan 2028
Love you Conan 😂❤❤
I ❤ Conan...
I have never seen someone go through this challenge like a legend conan was the best guest
Who else can get away with rubbing themselves with hot sauce?
CONAN IS SHAKING!!!!!!!
Conan couldn't swallow by the end. Gave that entire final monologue like an end stage dementia patient and it was amazing.
I'm sorry but American humour is simply not funny. Seems to be created and enjoyed by kindergarten-level intelligence. Pass.
Best one yet!!!!
Perfection. This is going to make future episodes almost impossible.
conan aggressively licking the sauce off the wing had me dead 😭😭😭
ROFLMAO!!!
Instant Classic
I'm convinced he contracted covid just to have such little reaction to the wings. You can not tell me different.
Conan for president
beast
This episode pretty much confirms that they are diluting the sauces to not be as potent. Because what Conan was doing is definitely going to create physical effects. It wouldn't matter how accustomed to spices you are, if you ingest the highest scoville rated sauce like he did, including smearing it on his lips, that will cause physical problems, and yet he had no signs.
LISAN AL GAIB!
The man is INSANE ROFL
Coating the wings <3
That was amazing
The goat
Conan is the BEST!
Hot ones games just been upped!!
Great Showman!!!!
First show I've seen where Sean seems to feel the hot sauce worse than the guest....LOL. That was unbelievable.
Give this man an emmy, Oscar…just for this performance. Always loved Conan. He had me literally rolling on the floor
God I love Conan.
This is one of Conan’s best shows, ever
Kwisatz Haderach!!!
Quite simply  I've always loved Conan but now he is a  COMEDY GOD I hope all other starts that have been on this show are crying in shame...
BEST. EPISODE. EVER.
That was amazing. lol. Thank you Conan.
Never watched his show and probably never will. I watched all interviews and that was the worse, he was so forced and so over… so annoying to watch. Not being a hatter, just honest
Yeah, "Max" isn't a better name than "HBO Max". They should have gone with their original choice, "HBO Weinberg".
Such a legend
Conan is true legendary showman status!  This is how I'd imagine the late great Robin Williams would be like on Hot Ones, down to Earth and just doing for the love of the industry!
Possibly the worst episode I've seen here. Most are great because we get to see the real person and learn more about them. Here Conan refuses to play and follow the rules. He takes control and never gives it back to Sean. It's just another boring episode of Conan's old jokes and him laughing at himself.
Conan really sold the bit of the water buffalo wildly attacking him and the crew.   Or is it true?   Who's to say?  (Though the lack of footage and this is a show about BUFFALO wings, suggest a clever bit of fiction)
Slayage to the MAX! 🤘  What an episode!  😂
Okay, I don't share your enthusiasm for this episode. Conan completely hijacked the hosting of it from Sean, only to make it a bit . . . and, yes, it was a bit. Conan's blustering and bravado allowed him to avoided the intimacy of the questions so we didn't learn anything more about him.  Actually, my least favorite Hot Ones episode ever. 😕
Conan got the assignment
Conan O'Brien and Craig Ferguson are the two greatest late night hosts that have ever existed. I will die on this hill.
What a show....
Conan  is an absolute beast. He destroyed the show.
conan just keeps getting better and better with age
This was sooooo amazing! Thanks Conan for this.
conan... thee best entertainer in the world hands down. also the ballsiest and truest to himself ...  this man is a LEGEND
Who's going to top Conan when he ate 1/4 of the pepper x....😅
Conan high on capsaicin ranting Max with spit and hot sauce all over him and the bottles of sauce pouring out onto the table is one of the funniest things I've ever seen
How did Conan hold it together? That's some talent. 😂
This episode makes me think how much of a shame it is that Robin Williams didn't live long enough to make an appearance on this show.
Best Guest ever.
This might be the first time in Hot Ones history that the sauce didn't own the guest, the guest owned the sauce
Best episode ever!! 😂😂😂
Conan u are the BEST late night talk show host 😂😂😂😂😂
CONAN!!! ❤❤❤
Only wish he wiped his mouth. Other than that great, great, show 🎉🎉
this guy is great🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was truly a laugh out loud episode. Conan is the GOAT.
This one is an instant classic. Conan truly is insane. Insanely funny. Seriously one of the best.
Conan for presidend 2028
This was probably the best Hot Ones interview of All Time!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
Love the screaming over Sean’s voice. Rick and Morty vibes 😂😂😂
I adore Conan. Not many people can keep me in stitches like that guy.
You wouldn't think this would have shock value, but it does
Conan never disappoints.
Best one yet!!! Conan!!!!!
Perhaps the greatest hot ones episode. Heartfelt, hilarious, original. Conan is a treasure and Sean rolled with the punches like the pro he is.
max isnt cinemax ? did they buy cinemax ?
😂
Now not only should we have to scoville scale, we need to add a Conan redness scale - or least a before/after image
We had many talk show host, and the new ones that take over, they give respect, Conan for me was the  goat! I started watching Leno because it was a trip from school. I got into the tonight show, And I stayed up and saw Conan. He was far better! 😂 this was awesome.
I haven’t laughed this hard in years 😂
I didn't like Conan for the longest time for whatever reason I can't really explain. Then there came a time when I really started to appreciate him, and now I feel he is so underappreciated its almost criminal.  He should be the king of late night right now. Without giving my opinion on Kimmel, Colbert, or Fallon I just feel Conan just blows them all out of the water.
Easily one of the best episodes we've gotten so far.
Dude raised the bar to another dimension…
"To the dome" blessed be
legend!
THE FUNNIEST EPISODE EVER ON THIS CHANNEL!
I hope DJ Khalid is watching this.
Conan is the hereby crowned king of the last Dab!! No one else has been this entertaining on this show ever!
I kept waiting for Arroyo to say "Less than 4 years" after he checked a pulse.
And then he died...
This is what peak performance looks like, everyone
The most savage way to take on the wings, legendary.
Conan NEVER Disappoints
😂 best one
this was the best. Conan, youre amazing.
Gotta love the Irish haaa
Conan is a professional
Conan's buffoonery is top notch. I'm very entertained.
And this ladies and gentleman is why Conan O'Brien is and will always be the best. A true legend.
Get rid of the Covid table!!!!
👏👏👏👏trully SHOWMAN my man Connan
Miss his show
This is the absolute opposite of the DJ Khaled episode in terms of sheer ENTHUSIASM AND COMMITMENT... now that's showbiz!
Conan is literally the king.  Knows what the people want
We have found the Goat.
How is it that conan was far more chaotic that Stevo! Lol
@ 1:24 is that the "Smug European Guy" from Conan's old Late night show?
Conan is the single greatest entertainer to ever live
09:00 Conan sets up what you're about to witness, and tells us in plain English. Master.
Conan is a Beast!!!!!😂😂😂
😂😂
I’m still laughing a day later.  You have outdone yourself! Bwahahahaha. 😂😅😂😅
Where's DJ Khaled?
Bro did a homer Simpson and coated his insides in wax.
Grand champion, Conan O'brien
I always knew, that Conan is..... No, calling that man insane, is both a exaggeration and a understatement at the same time. 😂 But with that said : After this, I just love him even more!!!! 🥰🥰🥰
Best ep ever!!
23:00 This will live forever. Thank you, Conan! 😂😂😂
absolute legend
This is effin gold... love you Coco... where the heck is the gerbil...❤😂😂😂
G.O.A.T.
Been a big Conan fan since the 90's, man has never failed making me laugh.
He started at a 9 and took it up to a 15
Conan O'Brien is the GOAT!
Hands down best one ive seen and ive watched them all.
One of my favorite episodes.... Conan is always so full of life, and he really went all in for this
Lol wss that water buffalo story true?
He becomes Benson when eating wings
Omfg Conan is the man
Maybe....the ......best .... episode???
The best one yet!!!😂
Conan the only talk show host I respect. Love this guy.
U can tell he is trying to keep Norm MacDonald alive 😊
In the year 2000...Conan will drink shots of hot sauce.
This has to be the most fun Sean's ever had on the show..certainly was for me
EASILY, THE BEST, BRAVEST GUEST EVER -- I've never seen his equal.   "I'm PERFECTLY F*CKING FINE!"
Conan's a BEAST!!
conan is just the coolest person on earth
Best episode yet! Go Coco!!!
Best show ever.
Has to be one the top ones 4 sure
normally the more up tempo music fits as people start to freak out but i found it really jarring in this episode to have playing as hes telling a story in the most relaxed manner possible
Rip Conan I’m sure he’s passed on after this 😂😂😂
“You’re not a doctor are you? I should be.” Conan deserves all the lauds but Dr. Arroyo nailed his parts so succinctly. Perfect delivery and timing.
Conan’s freaking amazing 😂 😂 😂 Can’t wait for Apr. 18!
The best episode of the show so far
Conan bringing in an actor to play his doctor is so funny
Conan is the greatest of all time
Can't believe they got the best Tonight Show Host on
A Universal Irish Man.. Drink Pepper for Fun
That was insane
Nugget pocket
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
Might be THE BEST episode of Hot Ones. Hilarious and Conan is SAVAGE. What a badass. (Dave Grohl was sweet too). Get snoop and hit the blunt for every wing
First time I’ve laughed at Conan as he’s drooling and slobbering milk
I never liked Conan, but he killed this interview. Amazing performer!
Bro is that me showing off my calves? I don't remember being on conan.
The best episode.
Best guest ever?
Truly committed to his craft. Conan has always been the lovable a$shole.
Best episode ever!!!
This was amazing 😂
I think Conan knew about the interview with ice spice and did all of this to clean that bad taste, this man is a legend
God, Conan is such an animal. I love gim.
That's pure determination. That's why he has done what he's done seriously. Dude lost his mind but still did it
how!?
lol, a real legend
Mad respect
What a monster
He looked like the joker at the end 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
that poor doctor, has been abused XD
The man delivers
He went full lunatic
Ok, shut it down everybody. This is it, nobody will ever top Conan's episode of Hot Ones. It was a good run!
Ok I wanna give Conan a hug
He is a living Simpsons character
Connan is a beast! Respect!
Conan is the Hot Ones LORD!!!
I don't think I've ever laughed so hard watching this show
Conan went crazy! Bravo Sir! Well worth the wait!
“What’s wrong with me why can’t I feel!”
“he’s a cheap one” 😂
"I yam what I yam...Ghandi said it" while waving chicken wings has me cackling in tears
LEGEND OF LATE NIGHT
Everything is just funny with Conan
Simpsons was so much better when Conan was writing. Then again, so was SNL. Actually, a lot of things are better with Conan.
Legitimately the funniest Hot Ones ever. I was utterly terrified he was gonna touch his eyes though at some point.
Best. First We Feast. Episode. EVER!!
I literally cried
HOOOOOOOLY nice
Yeah.. Conan is the goat after this.. I've actually had da'bomb, and i am speechless. He is the GOAT of entertainment.
This is up there with Key and Peele episode.
5:30 Hearing Conan actually say the f bomb actually made me bug eyed.
3:00 And that’s exactly y I hate u Conan, everything u do makes me feel dumber lol
Met him when he came to Argentina. Incredibly nice and incredibly tall.
About time!
😭I’m fiiine😭😭I’m perfectly fine🔥😭🔥😭🔥🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best one yet
how much of that was Conan losing his mind as part of an elaborate bit and how much of it was the wings acting as a sort of intoxicant I cannot say. But it was definitely a memorable episode.
Wow  Conan still got it
I'm afraid to touch my eyes and I'm not even there
Tha absolute carnage Conan made of the sauce bottles, his face and clothes was hilarious.
“Dr Arroyo, he’s not the best, but he’s very affordable” 😂😂
He’s not the goat, this man is a GOD
Da Bomb is Da Water Buffalo.
The Flaming C takin one for the team like a champ to fight racism of "white ppl cant handle spice"
Best episode by far. I watched it twice in a row. Conan is a legend
I've watched hot ones since 2016. This is the best episode ever produced.
Get NARDWUAR!!!
Conan is the man. Always hilarious 🤣
Conan took the highest level and destroyed it. He is the king of hot ones!
This is the best episode.
Probably the best episode ever
now sean is scared of conan, 22:43 you can feel it
Crush cup
This has to be the most legendary episode...dude needs a trophy
Best show yet 😂
I feel like my life is complete after watching this.
This is the best episode yet! Love Conan!!
This is why Conan is THE talk show host of all time. An ICON.
When Conan got to the Da Bomb, I was getting serious Quentin Tarantino vibes
Conan is the best!! I miss him in The Simpsons!
The best one of ALL time!!!
This man has been my personal hero since I was 9 years old. I continue to be in awe of his deranged brilliance.
That old man gut is going THROUGH IT after drinking hot sauce lol.
The Simpsons really need to have Conan back as a writer.
I was almost expecting him to grab the sauce and rub it into his eyes he was going that deep lol 😂😂😂
First guest in a long time worth watching
I'm absolutely positive this man jumped on a water buffalo for no reason.
“Where did you go to medical school?”  “Ohh…in 1998!” …  “You should go”  Precisely why Conan should be forever treasured. 10 out of 10! Love this guy!
Conan is not a late night host. He's a comedian first and foremost and an incredible entertainer. This was a masterclass
This was a magnificent appearance
BEST.EPISODE.EVER!! Conan is a legend and you can't top this one!!!! ❤❤❤❤🙌🏽🙌🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The hardest I’ve laughed in awhile. Conan is amazing
"Max" first makes me think of Norma Desmond's butler/chauffeur/ex-husband and then the Grinch's dog .    Oh, and the German Shepherd test animal for bionic technology.
I can't believe you let him pour da bomb on it without at least a warning. Lol
Conan had more spice on his tongue than all of dune
I like how he brought the bit with him, and I lol'd when he asked permission to put wings in his pocket.
conan is the greatest comedian
Amazing. Skewers modern sensibilities. Provides thoughtful answers. Argues for entertainment as a venue for ENTERTAINING and not PREACHING.   Absolutely the goat.
I once saw this yank running around merrion square in Dublin waiting for my bus and I was speechless, I was just wondering what this man needed such a big camera crew for
Conan had it until he drank the milk.
Pure Chaotic energy
Conan is the last gladiator to be standing while blood is pouring out of every wound. This man is a monster of a human being. 🤘🤘
AWESOME
Epic! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Im watching his new show. Hat's off to Conan. Mission accomplished.
I have never laughed out loud so many times watching this show! And I don't think Sean has either! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Conan you are hilarious!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
RIP Conan from violent diarrhea 5 minutes from this interview
Incredible.
Has anyone ever drank straight from the tap like that? 😂
“What’s wrong with me. Why can’t I feel?” 😂😂😂
Da F'ing GOAT!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan is by far the best talk show host in existence. What happened to him by the other guy was a robbery.
What an absolute genuine legend!  I’m such a huge fan!  That was an amazing episode!
what a freaking champ
Wings in the pocket is all time amazing
Loved Conan, the only late night show I watched
This is god-tier lol
I’m in tears, I’m literally. in. Tears. 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Merica!😂😂😂best episode ever!😂😂😂😂holy cow 😂😂😂😂
Peoble are dumber after watching his show
All hail Conan
I’m perfectly fine 😂😂😂
conan is the king 😂
Conan,  " he's not a good doctor, he's an affordable one" lol
A lot of guests compliment Sean on his interviewing, but I feel like Conan's compliment was the most sincere/genuine I've seen.  He really wanted Sean to feel good with that one.
I love this so much
Best episode ever!
Someone needs to make "I'm fine! I'm perfectly fine!!" a meme!
Conen O’Brien incredible
Incredible 😂😂🙌🏽🙌🏽
can you check for a pulse for me? "it's there"
All timer for sure.... a classic in the making.... truly legendary.  (Slow clapping in back ground) cheers to you Conan.
The best!
Best ever😮
Conan is the undisputed champion of Hot Ones 😂🏆
Conan calling out HBO for dropping the name that people associate with... And calling themselves just MAX is great.
😂 This is how you do comedy everyone! Let's get back to this!
I wonder if Conan washed his hands before using the bathroom?
Bar none, the most impressive hot ones I've ever seen.  Conan O'Brien isn't a person he's a force of nature.
Best episode ever!!🎉
Probably the only good ep this season
I’ll never forget what I just watched
might be the best episode of all time 😂
I guess if you know Conan he is probably a lot. But he is such a great entertainer.
I love conan!!!! This is my favorite episode! And you got a complement from the greatest.
one of the best episodes ive ever seen on this show... probably my favorite.
There is a reason that Howard Stern after 40 years of interviewing guests and 10k guests said Conan was #1...hands down this will never be beat in Hot Ones....ever! 🔥...simply amazing ..Wing DROP
This was amazing Conan did a bold move with bomb and the hotter sauces
Conan was already a legend. He's ascended to legend+
far and away the best episode ever, Conan is an absolute legend
We f ing love you Conan🥹
You’ve been boring lately, but this was great 👍
Conan is Irish?
Did. Not. Disappoint!
YES. This is an episode. 🙌🏼 Mad love for CoCo.
Doctor- *sets stethoscope on tongue* “yeah it’s not good” Conan- “you’re not a doctor are you” Doctor- “I should be”  This dry and perfectly delivered comedy doesn’t exist anymore..
That WAS incredible.
Love Conan every since I was 10 now 23 any little bit we get of him since he left is always a treat but I really need this MatPat interview😂😂😂
dude, I have no words, that was epic
TEAM COCO TAP IN! 👇
Is this staged cuz it’s crazy 😂
As entertaining as this was, I lowkey didn't want to see Conan drooling bits of chicken and mucus all over everything.
Ha! Where's Jordan?
he's not the best, but he really affordable 🤣
THIS.... episode......Needs some kind of Award !!  🏁🏁
22:38
Conan is the king
You could put a mini Conan on a surfboard carving a tube in his hair.
Thank you Sean and Conan!
Painful to watch a washed up actor
I literally see Conan’s lips growing the more sauce he has 😂better than lip filler 😂
He literally turned from flour white to orange to blush red 😂
I love this guy
conan giving rick sanchez vibes in this one
Bravo 👏
Conan goated
Thats it... he ended your format... Thats what you get for inviting a phenom!!!
is he going back to Haiti?
Best thing I've seen on the internets in quite some time.  Bravo!
Alright. Only a few hours old and I'm predicting this is the best episode of hot ones ever made
Im dead
Hands down greatest hot ones guest and episode of all time!
Best Hot Ones ever!!!😂
This show is incedible
Conan just made Hot Ones history.
Greatest episode of all time
You can power through eating very hot stuff if you don't think about the stomache pain later
Conan obrien BEST GUEST EVER
This was the best episode in a while!
That. Was. Beautiful.
Conan is the embodiment of a chaotic good Aries 😂
Im a hot suace guy. And this was totally insane. No way.
If you didnt laugh out loud. Youre the problem.
That was the most insane episode I’ve seen! 😂😂😂
I love Conan O Brien, man. Unmatched, I swear
I yam what i am - popeye, conan, gandhi probably 😂😂
This was incredible. Conan is a freaking powerhouse.
Incredible test of taste and humor!  I wanna buy each one and try myself, chased with sweaty hot dogs and sauerkraut.
Conan is crazy!! 😂😂 The best!!!
Conan, you can be my wingman anytime.
I love Conan so much and he is right. Sean is really good at interviewing people, but with a twist. However, coming from Conan that as a world class compliment. Beautiful soul Conan is.
Man I miss Clueless Gamer. 😂
This is the best hot ones of all time!
Conan getting that hosting job was a billion to one? Nah he was a billion to none to not get it.
"This isnt going so well." NOT said by Conan Obrien, Hot wings, season 23 finale.
i love conan so much.
I have adored Conan for over 30 years, his unique, over the top, and brilliant humor has only gotten better. I’m so glad he is peaking again, us on Team Coco never left.
If this is Conan on hot sauce, I don't wanna see him do coke 😂
2 days ago? Dang…..
holy god what a specimen
Conan is pure gold, always.
That was every bit of amazing!!😂😂
He is the master. Conan is a born entertainer and pure entertainment is flowing through his veins.
"I like to announce my mistakes upfront." Conan OBrien.  Im getting t-shirts.
sean MUST put up a large picture of conan in the background for all others to see!!!!!!!!!!
Conan = 🐐
Conan never disappoints.
When are u guna bring back Ethan and Hila H3H3. Would love to see them both do this again
Sean just experienced a real true entertainer
I’m loving this, and I haven’t even started watching it yet! 😁
I was waiting for you to self-combust Conan
Best one yet!!
These have to be fake sauces
hes such a good host he knows exactly what makes the best guest, one that makes the show "their show". shots are always working so hard, I bet it was so nice for a guest to be the entertaining one for once. brought his own actor, made the episode his own. so good
The man is a masterpiece!😆
“Call the wife!” Loooool
Finally!!!!!
The GOAT Host. Finally. Anyone that pursues a career in entertainment would get a lot of help from analyzing conan in thsi interview.
Ok, that was great! My cheeks are cramping up! Awesome season finale guest. Love Conan! 😂❤ … he even brought his own sidekick and wrote a comedy bit around it! 😅😂
The GOAT Host. Finally. Anyone that pursues a career in entertainment would get a lot of help from analyzing conan in thsi interview.
He's gotten more intolerable as he ages.
This is the best episode so far. Conan is just wow
Gingers have higher pain tolerance and conan is a psychopath so these sauces are nothing 😂
why is he acting like bianca del rio
Hot Ones has met their match
Unhinged
You can really see the ways that popular streamer Jerma may have been influenced by Conan. Fake doctor bit feels a lot like a Jerma sort of thing.
"WING DROP" -Conan  O' Brian 2024
The goat!!!! Never thought I’d see Conan on here I just started the video but I alr know this gonna be fire
I was swallowing food when Conan called out Dr. Arroyo to hand him a wing and I almost choked on it.
I love conan
22:58 made this entire video. i cant stop
I still can’t believe Jay Leno was chosen to take Letterman’s spot over Conan. We might have still had a late show with Conan O’Brien and not all these other lame hosts.
Hilarious
21:07 makes me think of Robin Williams. Would totally be something he would do 😂
My new favorite episode. Conan is an idiot and I fookin love it!!!!
Conan's beauty mark over his top lip was mesmerizing. Conan Crawford has entered the building.
conans energy is just out there, i dont care if its over the top, sometimes you just have to do it. what a great way to end the season. tbh. i loved your show and still does. but conan just brought me back to watching it.
Conan is the best!
We achieved it, guys. We got the greatest Hot Ones episode OF ALL TIME
As a fellow O’Brien but raised in Ireland I stand in awe of Conan making it to the end- there’s got to be something else in his blood to be coherent after all those hot sauces
Conan has been entertaining me since his OG show started. My dad and sister didn't get his comedy but my mom and I find him hilarious AF. Love you Conan and Hot Ones!
GOAT Episode
Nobody can ever question conans commitment to comedy/entertainment
Animals with rabies: 22:59
Keanu Reeves must come to the show
Jesus Christ your hair looks like s***
That was beautiful!!!! It is the hot sauce that binds us.❤️❤️❤️
Legit first 4 wings thought he had covid or something where he lost his sense of taste
Conan O'Brien is not human 🙀🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Conan has not only had an incredible career as a talk show host but also wrote two of the greatest episodes of the greatest comedy show in history, The Simpsons. I reckon I've randomly quoted from Marge vs The Monorail and Homer Goes To College about once a week since 1992. Guys a legend.
The best episode yet. And that’s saying something
I've watched this channel since the first episode. This was the best episode ever ❤️😂
Conan, you are the best!!!! Never saw a more crazy Hot Ones! You da man!!!
Damm
Legendary!!😅 Who'll ever be able to top this?!?
That ending speech was priceless!!!! 😂👏
Season 23!
LARRY DAVID NEXT
Conon, ship me those chicken bones in ur pockets, I love you
One of the best. I laughed so hard I cried. He's still the loon I remembered.
Kinda feel inspired, you have a job, you do with your absolute best
Coni channeled Farley for a minute
How terrible… 😪
I-C-O-N-I-C PERIOD
"My pockets getting full" is one of the funniest things he's ever done
I never thought someone could top or be Over the Top more than Chef Ramsay...i was wrong.  Thank you Sean. Thank you, Conan. I think Schwarznegger, upon seeing this, would nickname you Conan the Barbarian!
Conan is a king in this world
The GOAT right there.
Enjoy the first episode where Sean Evans was the co host and Conan O'Brien was the star of all stars. Fantastic interview, i wish it was a lot longer.
This wasn’t as entertaining as I expected   I’m just under the impression he took a lot of acid and went to eat
I don't envy conans bathroom tomorrow morning
What a gangster
love conan ❤
they should've brought jordan schlansky to play the doctor
First guest I have truly cared to watch in awhile
F me this is the best episode ever
He decided to stop putting the wings in his pockets after he tried "Da bomb"😂😂😂
If Conan doesn’t take this opportunity to come out with a hot sauce
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Like if you love Conan
Conan is the only talk show host who deserves to actually have a show. Everytime I watched something of his he gets a few laughs out of me
I love Conan, he really is good at his art
No one will top Conan on this
The reason Irish people eat such bland food must be because spice has absolutely no effect on them 😂
Oh Conan. You never disappoint. It was threatened you'd be on the show ... And you were, and you just made my day.  God bless , funny inside and out.
Jesus Conan... Jesus buddy...
I thought his nose started bleeding
Stethoscope on the tongue 😂😂😂
I came in with high expectations but that interview was incredible. Calling it the best Hot Ones ever is a big call, but it is.
Honestly one of if not the best Conan performance I’ve ever seen
Hall of fame episode right here. Incredible. 😂😂😂😂
RIP Colon O'Brien
I love Conan ! My bday Twin!! Yea Conan !! 🥂🥂🥂🥂
Enjoyed this show while it lasted but what a great last episode, the best.  Cannot get better.
that was PAINFUL.
"They used to call it HBO, but people found that too POPULAR!"
The only thing that wasn't funny was all that sauce and pieces of half chewed chicken wing around his mouth at the end. Can't believe Conan was chugging that sauce like that either.
Conan literally broke the Hot ones!!!
"You don't know what real danger looks like anymore!".. no I know about the media trying to get me injected with rushed "mystery" juice..
Hes so unhinged 🤣
conan is so so so special. a true born showman and comedian and a genuine person. you just knew he would own this and take it to a whole other level.. everything. loved his closing monologue sean was really enjoying this and it showed. loved how conan complimented him too. whoever says they love conan I immediately trust you. love from Israel, under rocket fire
I WAS NOT READY!
The irish "Saul goodman" 😅😂
Conan’s hot sauce joker smile by the end of the episode is iconic. He gave us what we wanted.
This is one of the most brilliant things I've ever seen
Best guest yet.
How is it he has jokes off tops?😂😂
I was prepared to know this is how Conan died
Not the biggest fan of Conan normally, but I think this is the best hot ones episode I've ever seen.
WHATS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE😂😂
He Raised the Roof! this show can not top that! 😂 Maybe Jim Carrey 🤔
Conan has proven to me that as long as there's a camera in front of him he'll do anything for a laugh. Glob bless this man and his work!
Him and lil nas x are the BEST EPISODE'S 😂❤
!🤣😂😅🤣😂😅
Conan O'Brien is one of the funniest people on the planet and this is, hands down, the best episode of Hot Ones ever. The worst episode ever was DJ Kahled. I highly recommend watching them back to back.
"Where did yuo go to medical school?"  "Uh, 1998."
This will never be topped.
Conan is a national treasure
Man I'm dying over here thank you Sean and thank you Conan!
Wow... One of the best interviews ever! Only Conen!
Holllyy Smoked Conan is absolute LEGEND! This takes the number 1 spot of my favorite episodes! I’m not the only who thinks the same. The other comments were spot on too. I don’t think anyone will top this episode 😆🤣
Whats the song starting at 23:00?
Da bomb...im feeling it a little bit 😂
Hot ones, hosted by conan OBrien.
The best guest ever
Dear Conan you had  me laughing from start to finish!!! What an amazing Comedian you are!
Not the best interview (not bad at all). But maybe the best guest in hot ones history.
this just says a lot about conan when he is under duress.
I would put this episode right up there with the Gordon Ramsay one
I love Conan
The was the Best One yet:)
THE HAIR NEVER FELL
Oh my God! It’s Conan! ❤❤❤
Conan is just incredible. He's literally going through pain here to deliver us a great show. In my eyes, one of the best entertainers to ever live.
They are gonna have to up the heat after this one…
🤣💯🥳
CONAN O'KING O'BRIEN O'CAPTAIN
why am i sweating?
The only TRUE King of Late Night after Carson.
Ed Currie needs to see this video. Never would I think someone besides Ed can handle Pepper X with ease! Conan just destroyed the hottest pepper on the planet like it was nothing.
Conan the Barbarian
You can retire Sean the show peaked. Nothing will beat this.
I was never a big Conan fan, but I have a newfound respect. He is a true professional. You go, girl!!!
What a great episode, couldnt even fathom a better 27 minutes
What a show man
It really doesn't get better than Conan.
Easily the best episode ever.
Sean: How are you around hot sauce.  Conan: I'm terrible with spicy food. I grew up around tasteless food. So this is something new for me.  Also Conan a few minutes later: 🤬😤😡🥱😎
Greatest hotones ever
Hands down BEST guest!!
In my opinion I think Conan has been the best guest so far. Just how he answers the questions with great enthusiasm and really knows how to handle the heat lol.
I kind of wish you would have asked the ate the wings and I not just nibbled on them but way to go
The way Conan just commands the show with witty comedy bits is just gold.
best episode yet
This guy is a living legend
Coco is the best. Late night is nothing without him!
The best Hot Ones ever. Conan you’re a beast! Shawn, amazing as always man. Thank you for every episode of every season. ❤
Conan is the greatest of all time.
This has to be the best episode yet. 😂😂
Sean Evens, for what it's worth, you're awesome, brother. Please keep your YouTube show going
I don't feel like Conan's ok :'(
Conan a gangster
Best Hot Ones episode ever 😎
Best one ever
everytime I hear max I think skinemax. Cinemax
When Conan got to the bomb and drank it, i was like ok sir you got my respect. The first on to ever take a shot of hot sauce on hot ones. Not only from one sauce but from different ones! What a legend.
Youd think some older people like myself would think of cinemax when they hear max lol.
What an absolute legend. That stuffs no joke and he made a joke of it still. The guy’s incredible. Big respect Conan.
Oh My God, best one yet, he went over the top!
Conan gets louder the more pain hes in
My new favorite episode. Pure showmanship. This was incredible. 🎉
Been watching since season 1, this is the best episode so far… Not even close …
conan is so funny
He ceased to be pale by the end
Further proof, Conan is the master of all time
... and the next day! 💩🤬
This is my favorite Hot Ones episode 😂
Get karrueche tran here ❤
“The other guy.” What an incredible, but subtle, shot at Leno. 😂😂😂
The amount of times Sean said “oh my god!“ in horror and disbelief is how you know how insane this was.
Is this how we find out Conan abuses narcotics
By far, my favourite so far... and I'm only 2 minutes in!  Just brilliant prep work by Conan to bring his own "doctor" to add to the interview.
21:03 it's like i'm transported to late night lol
“I should be” 😂😂😂
"Call the Wife!" is just wild..
All-timer
Is it low key a baller move that he can just use that threaded suit as a chicken wing dump
I MISS CONAN ON LATE NIGHT NYC
Unlike the others where I just skip to the DaBomb part… I actually watched the whole thing.
actual funny late night host makes people laugh
Wow what a pro
Conan O’Brien!  Just hilarious!  How did you guys get him to agree to do this 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I knew that THIS would be my favorite episode ever.... I wasn't wrong
The other guy! He still won't say Leno 😂
Wow..body the whole thing sir... body the whole thing... da bomb though???? God mode activated 😆 ❤😂
One word about Conan: GOAT
Conan can you send me those wings frames with your signature😂😂
Bruh Conan is still the funniest man alive
Anyone else catch themselves smiling throughout the episode, not just because it’s funny, but because you’re witnessing greatness?  This was more spirited than the greatest rally, or pre-game locker room speech.
Not sure why everyone is adoring this episode, it seemed cringy to me. Conan acted psychotic, or like he was on drugs.
No words in any language can accurately or artistically portray the love I have for this man. Truly a living legend.
Best episode ever!!!!!!!
they Should have had bill Clinton and Bob dole sticking they’re tongues out tasting the hot sauces
Absolute Legend!
Always making us laugh at his own expense. I’ll never forget going to his show in NYC when I was younger and Donald trump was the guest. (Wayyyy before he ever thought about being president). I just remember one thing more than anything else. Conan was wayyyyy taller than I expected. He’s a legend and this is the best episode ever.
This was the best guest yet. Well done! I love Conan.
Hands down best episode
With all the respect to all the celebrities that have been in this show, Conan O'Brian by far is the best, #1!!!!!!!!
The most underrated joke in this is "charlie rose with chicken wings"
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!!!
AMAZING!
He just won "Hot Ones". No need to search further. The chosen one has been found.
No topping this - ever.
Conan didn't like that shirt or jacket so he just decided to make them unsalvageable.
THE BEST EVER!!! I laughed sooo000 stinkin hard!!!! BEST HOT ONES by far!!!
This guy just isn’t funny.
This was up there with Conan on the Howard Stern show. Conan is the goat
That was by far in a way the one of the best if not the best episode ever. Conan is an absolute legend. This was also the most unhinged show I think there's ever been. I loved every second of this
The best !!!!
THIS is how’s it done.
Conan for president!!! Conan rules and i miss the old show!! ✌️👍
So funny 😂
It is difficult not to be entertained by Conan O'Brien.
What a legendary episode
The Wing Drop!!! 🎉👏🏽
This is the episode we've been waiting for😂
An absolute unit of a man
Legend 🎉
I don't always like Conan but he did a great job on this one.
Conan you are legend
Wow! Great episode. Conan kills every time
Best one in a while
Best. Episode. Ever. 😅
best episode of hot ones
BEST.. EPISODE.. EVER..
This made me laugh till I cramped and cried.
I love conan
😂😂😂😂
I'm glad I'm not the only one.. that puts meat in the pocket
Never thought Conan could be that crazy...
Conan O'Brien shirt is so blue, it's mesmerizing.
Best ever.
The goat
It's been many, many years since I've watched Conan. Mainly because I don't have cable and not because I didn't like his show. He was my favorite talk show host aside from Letterman. Glad to see he still has the hair!
CONAN DESTROYED!!!! Best EVER EPISODE!!! Hahahaha
Conan's mouth is dead inside, I guess...
Hands down this is the best episode you have done! Conan is a fckin comedy genius
Conan got totally wasted on hot sauce. 😅😅
The true Conan the King
I'm only here for Conan.
Conan is the Best!!!  "Letterman did this and THE OTHER guy did whatever".......HA!!!
Conan killed it.  A classic already!
This episode was fire. 🔥
Best episode yet. 11/10
I just witnessed pure love in action.
Might be my new favorite episode!
Conan is the MASTER of showmanship!!!!!
To me there’s a difference between being funny and being silly!
That has to be the best ever! Conan, I mean C'mon!! What original raw talent he has. That was a joy to watch. He eats wings like I do. The hotter and messier the better. Just a great Show Sean!!!!!
thats what happens when you don't listen to andy
Best episode ever!
This is it. That's the best episode ever, I laughed tears.
I don't like his politics, but Conan is still one of the best at comedy. His commitment to his craft is rarely paralleled by anyone and he seems to honestly just want to make people laugh no matter what it takes. I met him once, and in person he's a nice fella. Was very gracious and in no way arrogant or anything like a lot of celebs I've met (looking at you Ben Affleck). The chicken wings in the pocket, the fake doctor, the guzzling hot sauce and drooling all over the place are exactly the kinds of things you expect from him. And you know he was in severe pain the entire time, but he still pushed it over the top anyways. You have to admire that.
I love Conan so much
This is by far the best one ever. You need to have him back with even hotter sauces.
I was not prepared for it to be that funny.
My God that was amazing. A masterclass in comedy and entertainment. Best episode ever.
undoubtedly the best episode of hot ones ever. conan must be protected at all costs. he’s a legend.
Absolutely Epic ❤
The set: destroyed  The face: disgusting  The hair: absolutely perfect  The comedy: gold
there will never be another Conan
Absolutely the best one I’ve seen yet. O’Brien is the man
Conan is the goat!
I really hope that ranger survived
Dr.Arojo being Dr.Nick coded as Conan slowly turns into Homer
What a fucken legend 👏
Didn't know Conan O'brien getting wasted on hot sauce is what i needed 😂
I didn't know Conan was this insane hahahaha. One of the greatest episodes of all time!
another legendary interview for the books!
Unbeatable performance, one of a kind human and the true king of late night 👏
Da Bomb always gets them.
idk how he downed the bomb, and is still talking like nothing happened despite telling us he is feeling it
man is a mad legend, a character on par with no one else, old school but completely open to new things, my favorite kind of person.
Too much!!  Funny? More like very noisy. By the end it left me with virtual earache and headache.
After watching this, I firmly believe Conan should play the Joker.
Love Conan, don’t usually comment on videos but was sad when he retired
Conan brought the most Bryan Cranston energy in the most Conan type of way
Respect!
I think this is the wildest episode i've seen! Love it!
best episode. period 😂
This was the best one yet! So funny to watch!
Thanks for the laugh guy 😅😅😅
That was the most unhinged episode of hot wings I have ever watched. Conan’s still got it
Instant classic 🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🎤👇🏿
Conan: "He's affordable." Sean: "You're paying him with the half-eaten wings you're pocketing, aren't you?"  Missed opportunity, Sean. ;)
Out of all the good things that exist, I would pick Conan
His face turned so incredibly red at the end 😂
"Youre only going to live for 4 more years tops" made me lol
Wow.  New respect for the commitment to the bit.  Enjoy your two weeks off after that Conan!!
This is one of the greatest things I've ever seen in my life
Literally the absolute best interview ever
Fallon, Colbert, Meyers, and Kimmel, all together, are nothing compared to Conan by himself. I think, in fact, they're in the negative. Interesting
Literally crying laughing
best episode ever
I thought Conan was so far gone of the hot sauce at the end there, that he was about fling hot sauce every where and blind Sean and the camera man 😂
By far the best guest ever!
The BEST episode EVER!! A Man that DRINKS hot sauce!! THE BOMB!!!!
Legendary
One of the best hot ones episodes ever
"CALL THE WIFE!" lol
Conan said he would get shot and break bones for a laugh.. I bet after he took down Da Bomb like that... getting shot probably didn't sound too bad 😂😂
Who doesn't love some conan, great show
Conan is a gem.
I really needed this laugh today. Great episode @firstwefeast and thank you Conan.
At this point Conan could have a severe mental break and nobody would be sure if it was a bit or not.
Conan is the GOAT
My goodness, Conan does it again...
This dude did far better than i ever thought. Dam
Dr. Arroyo reminds me of Dr. Nick, which Conan very much may written.
Is he human?
I also grew up in an Irish household outside of Boston and I can confirm that at the very outer edge of the Scoville scale in our house was ketchup. Nothing spicier existed in my life than that until I got to college and started hanging out with my Asian roommates. Then things got considerably dicier for my stomach.
Conan has the pink eyes of an Opossum. 😬
Fantastic!  Conan is the best.
Wow. What a rollercoaster
One of the best episodes ever.
Opining on Chaucer while his face looks like a toddler at dinner time 😂😂😂😂 Conan is the BEST
Conan was so held back on the late show. We got robbed for 15 years. He’s finally unleashed the mans a comedic monster 🔥 😂
Awesome 😂 video
i love Conan... seeing him here makes me miss his late nite monologues... one of my favorites videos was Student Driver with Ice Cube and Kevin Hart... HALARIOUS!!
Best one I've seen yet!!!! Conan is a legend!!!
My stomach started to hurt from laughing 😂
Well I will never play poker vs Conan
the hot sauce is literally the same color as Conan. Maybe that's why he's so immune.
Hardest I've ever laughed in an episode 🤣
He’s going off on that hot sauce like it was a big pile of coke!
not funny tbh
We need more Conan!
I love this show, and this may very well be my new favorite episode. 😂
Absolutely the funniest one I’ve seen!
the greatest ever
I think Coco was possibly the greatest Hot Ones guest of all time.  That was just awesome.
it would be amazing if that was his doctor like 100%
Professor O’Brien’s Master Class on Comedy.
I got scared looking at Conan when he was tossing the sauces.
Just compare Conan's appearance with Gordan Ramsay's. There's a reason why Conan is beloved and Gordon is...   tolerated.
This is definitely one for the highlight reel of this show. That was so unhinged, and hilarious! Conan straight up just drank some of the hot sauces. What an animal! 😂
I'm crying 😂😂😂
I'm speechless
Man I love Conan, i'm so ready for this episode!!!!!
The only thing missing was andy😂
I compare this to BORAT! I couldn't stay put on my seat! SHEZZZZZZ!!!! hahahahha what a video! CONAN! your visit on Hot Ones will not be forgotten! LoL. Cheers from Argentina. Fede
Did Conan write the Homer chili pepper episode? He put wax in his mouth
Legend.
Dude how much coke did he do before the show. Amazing performance 👏
I feel like this is his audition for playing the joker.
Conan knows something that I don't know.
By far...the best episode yet.
ANYONE who says Sean isn’t a great interviewer has brain damage. I’ve seen people say it and it baffles me.
In my mind I was giving Conan a hard time for not being able to adjust to the Max name. But when he first said Max I thought of Max Weinberg.
Greatest Hot Ones EVER!!!!!
I’m telling y’all… the Irish can handle some fracking spice! ❤😂🎉
How fitting that the guy who wrote some of the best episodes of The Simpsons would pull off such a Homer-esque move of pocketing the wings.
Conan a great funny energetic late night host and definitely going to be checking out his podcast!!!
conan o'brien is the definition of an american icon. what a fcking guy
Best episode everrrr😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂!!!!!!!!!!!
Totally over the top and brilliant!
Easily one of the funniest people on the planet alive
Not funny, what an embarrassment!
Legendary
Conan is an ANIMAL!!  Respect...
This is the best hot ones ever
Hands down one of the best episodes by far.  Conan is a legend!
New benchmark on the show really. Not sure if any other celeb can surpass this level of  epicness !
Best. Finale. Ever.
definitely takes a top tier episode ever, top 3 at minimum lol
Conan is soooo old now
Wow, Conan is just an incredible entertainer! Even though he portrays himself as this ten-year-old child with too much energy he still comes off as highly intelligent! Truly no one like him. One of the best episodes ever!
CO made this the worst episode ever, what an embarrassment!
He's making eat those wings to who ever send him there 😂😂😂
Conan best talk show host ever
Conan a.k.a Coco looks like on some coco.
@18:17 absolutely hilarious
Conan never fails!!!!
I have never cried during Hot Ones 😢, Conan is the best!
CONAN IS GOD
Out of many folks in Hollywood Conan is a real dude respect him for not being a sick mf like everyone in Hollywood
😂😂😂😂
SEAN with dat sweet CONAN CLEARANCE!!!
What a show🎉🎉🎉🎉
Even Conan O'Brien doesn't like the MAX name haha I still call it HBO MAX
This is the most Aries energy interview I've ever seen 😂
Youre th best conan!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤
Best one of the season!!!
i was jumping up & down laughing. Conan is the best! best episode ever. <3
Wow. Crazy season finale. What an inspiration. Never thought I would laugh out loud like that
The burn in his mouth, tongue, and lips is nothing compared to the burn that's going to follow..
This was absolutely chaotic from start to finish and I should not have been surprised considering it was Conan....
Whondoesnlynlove conan? I hate my new ph😂one. I refuse to corect
EPIC!
Oh god, not Conad
was he possessed by robin williams?
You need Tyson on this
Best one I've seen 😂😂😂
😂 This was my favorite episode, Conan had me laughing so hard 🙏 what a gem
Conan was straight Savage here…  and I mean like Macho Man Randy Savage in an interview.  He showed up, and there was his subdued moments counteracted where he was absolutely unhinged.  Drinking the Last Dab is his “cream rises to the top” moment.
I’ve never seen Shawn scared until this episode lol
The reverb trail on his Rick flair whooo was a great touch 😂
Hot Ones, over the years has had many great episodes but this one might be Top3 IMO
Best episode ever, I hope Conan never stops being Conan.
Listen Rusty you are a GD Liar.
Oh, my. What a whirlwind of a human being.
Conan the destroyer
Everyone needs a few pocket wings
❤ Thanks, Conan!
The first thing I did was search online if Conan was still alive ;)  The look on Seans face was priceless. So much concern and admiration at the same time, probably thinking “ohh no, I’m involved in killing a legend. What a way to go!”  I don’t remember laughing so hard in a long time, but it was the laughter of shear shock as I was completely flummoxed from this behavior, even though I should not have expected nothing less.   The only problem is where can this show go from here, it feels like it’s reached the mountain top, and I pray it hasn’t jumped any sharks by doing this since I love the format and the depth of the interview questions and the way that Sean conducts the “show”.
Yup!  Right up there with the Gordon Ramsey episode, my god!
Dr arroyo 😂
God bless Conan, awesome interview
he's crazy :o
No lie, I was waiting for Da Bomb and I wasn't disappointed.
Any other guest goes ANYWHERE near their face~ "Careful round the eyes".  Conan flailing wildly as he froths at the mouth~ *Shock and awe induced silence*
He should have Mike dropped all the wings from his pocket😂
this man is like a living 80/90's simpson character! love him
Insanity!  Is this not the greatest episode ever?
The man is a legend.
Cried laughing at times. Best ever?  Right there if not.  It's got my vote.
All these years Conan told us he couldn't feel anything inside, we just laughed. But well, here it is.
wow!! Conan doesnt look like hes aged
This episode made me laugh, inspire and gasp in horror. This is entertainment at its finest. Thank you Conan.
One of a kind that man!!!
Conan the GOAT, great episode!
"you're not a doctor, ¿Are you?" - I should be. 😅😅😅😅
What a legend.
Absolutely incredible performance
This has the energy of the pink guy video hair cake
When they do the master shot of both of them, it looks like forced perspective. Conan is a giant.
Best episode yet!
Woof- Conan doing his best TJ Miller- I love Conan but this was some desperate stuff, not funny.
🐐
Lma0 dr.arroyo
I love conan , aaannndd ,"his doctor"
This was a wild ride 😂
That literally made my day in the perfect of times, thank you Conan and keep kickin😂
Conan is the best
The best season finale on Hot Ones EVER!!! GREAT job guys!!!
Are you familiar with the TV show Hot One's?  Conan O'Brien was the best guest  ever hands down!! Thank you Sean Evans,  Conan and the Dr!  😆
best one ever
Conan is an absolute legend.
Conan was like the drewling zombie you want to find in your back yard.
Team Coco!! Woo!
Best talk show host imo!
Conan #1
Highest possible praise
😂😂😂😂 best hot ones ever!
Wow Connan changed everything...best episode ever
definately the bes hot ones ive ever watched
Ten hours of suffering follows. All off camera. I did two reapers in the day, and that is how it goes. TEN hours.
Burst out laughing when he drank it
I want the next 30 min of what happened to Conan
That botox is intense
The best hot ones interview ever hands down. Conan the Man!
Conan is the best
Awesome!!!😂 the best episode ever!
#2 on trending is right! This guy is a legend! Team coco all the way!
Fav Hot Ones episode and that's a BOLD statement! King Conan!
Conan wrote for the Simpson's when it was actually funny.   Legendary episode.
This is what makes life worth living.
BEST HOT ONES EVER
I need to know how Conan was the next day 👀🤣
Sippin on da bottles, true legend.
Conan was funny but maybe should've let the host ask the prepared questions a bit more. The acting went too far imo.
I rarely like a video on YT but this is 100% the exception! 🤣 And Conan is right about what's funny!
Future guests invited to come on to Hot Ones are gonna watch this episode and think, "how do I compete with that Irish madman?" Conan is the GOAT.
Conan is GenX. We don’t play.
ice spice couldn't finish... Conan went the complete opposite
This one is for the hall of fame
fukin brilliant
This is the Hot Ones episode that I never knew I needed. Conan (as said in multiple comments) is a true Hot Ones GOAT!!!
Conan just created the most rewatchable episode. Like Key and Peel’s and Ramseys and LeBoufs…I will be enjoying this for many years!!
I’d been to see Late Night with Conan O’Brien filmed live a couple times and Conan was so awesome and authentic with the audience before filming started. He would do a little stand up show for everyone.
Idk why I never expected this lol
This is the best way to end a season LOL
Conan is the best
Oh my god! I’m dead after this one
We need a follow up show to see if Conan crapped his pants afterwards. What an absolute legend!
Best episode ever
imitated but never duplicated
(22:54) "I'm perfectly fuc$%^& fine!" Amazing. haha
Legen * wait-for-it * dairy diarrhea coming right up!
Not sure why he thinks it's funny to act like he's broke when he's obviously not?
Legendary.
Doing a bit with Conan and chili clause would be dope
I remember when Conan got a concussion on his show doing a skit with go-karts or a rigged derby car or something.
Holy cow, that was the craziest episode I have EVER SEEN!!!!
MAX? MAX WEINBERG!!!!
you need to get nardwuar on this show
I love Conan but this was painful to watch. 😂
Conan is my hero. Best episode ever!
This is an excellent example of re-directing the train of thought from the emotional response to a sauce.  Takes a lot of focus and discipline to do this.  Would not be surprised if he could remove a nail that impaled his foot by himself.
Wow I’m speechless. Conan is one of the greatest of all time.
Take this one to the bank BRETT BAKER
Conan has once again made me bleed from his razor sharp wit. The Best of Our Generation. 🔥🔥🔥
23:00 * It be like that sometimes    21:05 ^ Accidentally skipped the vid to that part🤣
This was epic
Best episode ever ❤
Conan: Where did you go to medical school? Dr Arroyo: In 1998. Conan: WHERE?!  😂
Conan has created so many memes in a single episode
His doctor went to Hollywood Upstairs Medical College
Conan O'Brian is a freaking BEAST.  This was the most impressive episode EVER.
Call the wife!!! 😂
Absolute legend.
Considering that Conan was once a writer for The Simpsons; I'm convinced that he coated the inside of his mouth with wax for this episode.
Did Conan just no sell hot sauce? I feel like the last dab, should be the first dab going forward!😂
YESSSS I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
For all the stuff I've seen him in over the many years, I think this is the first time I've heard Conan use an F-bomb, and it's tripping me out.   (Note: Just for context, I'm not an super avid follower of his)
this is what my saturday needed
Best episode ever!
Literally the best one by far
We now have A WING DROP. Conan did it. IT'S A CONAN WORLD. WE JUST LIVE IN IT.
Conan is Best
Jesus, think the hot sauce turned him in sane....
I share a birthday with Conan? Nice!
This is crazy.
I fully believe Conan went so hard because he has so much respect for the show <3
I love him so much. ONE OF THE BEST TO EVER DO IT. God bless Conan and his career; past, present, and future!
The best guest no question !!
ohhhh yeahhhhhhhhhhhh😂
Conan is literally was/the best talk show host, hands down.. There will never be another quite like him…
Surprised by the other comments. This is the worst episode I've ever seen. Conan completely steamrolled Sean. Conan is a host and clearly doesn't know how not to be a host. The dumb/slapstick comedy is not funny.
Legend
MAN, what a beautifully orchestreted menace of a finale. Thanks guys, thats going to be hard to forget. Just brilliant 😐
I love Conan’s battle cry
5 more days
EXCELLENT episode, and love that Painted in the Sky was used as the final song.  Conan is the GOAT.
Imagine *Conan O’Brien* complimenting your interviewing skills!
Maestro.
Just reiterating what so many have said, but this was the best episode ever. I was fully expecting for Conan to take control over the show, which he did, but Sean knew this as well and he just let him. That's why Sean is such a great host.
This is easily the best episode.
This episode was amazing! 🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
Amazing episode! Genuinely surprised how well Conan did.
I hope Conan is still alive
Wow Conan Wow man, And the new Champion is....... CONAN O'BRiEN
"You can't stop me from being who I am" - GOAT!
Best ever
Is Conan the first guest to wear a tie?  Just seems so, Conan.
This was pure gold through and through 😂😂😂
That may be the greatest segment of comedy and professional stamina I've ever seen. I'm speechless. April 18th on Max. I'll be watching. I'm gonna watch this again right now. Thank you for that Mr O'Brian
YOOOO YESSSS
Epic 😂😂😂
This is the best Hot One's since Covid.
Probably the best episode ever.
Hes hilarious
He’s so annoying I don’t even want to watch but I have nothing else better to do…
Conan the Conquerer
22:26 OHHH MY GAH
Conan O'Brien is a pure LEGEND! :D
Best. Ever.
I feel Conan being one of the smartest people ever to grace television isn't talked about enough
22:26 OHHH MYY GAH
This was the most most unhinged episode for a long time and I am here for it!
This is comedy history
I'm crying I'm laughing so hard
Best
This was always going to be a good one, but Conan brought the fire! What a legend, had me laughing like a lunatic.
Couldn’t stop laughing. Conan is a true American legend.
I kept thinking that Conan was talking about his old drummer Max Weinberg
Oh my God BEST Hot wings EVER he is the funniest man EVER WHAT A FREAKING LEDGENDRY MAN ♨♨♨😎😎😎😎😎😎😎♨♨♨♨♨💪💪💪💪💪💪 Look at Gordan Ramsy ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ a World class Chef who nearlt died doing it
Hilarious !
Conan is the Least entertaining commentator I have Ever seen.
This has to be the best hot ones yet
Amazing episode!  I was crying from laughing so hard
Legendary
Fricking legend!
Conan’s an animal! I love it.
Wow! It's not my style of humor for this show, but respect where respect is due. I legitimately can't tell when , if ever, Conan used props. At the end, you can clearly tell his body is responding to significant spice ingestion, but he can somehow keep his lines fluid and on point. Regardless, I sure he puked profusely after the show😅
The absolute goat man alive i was not expecting this but in hindsight i guess I should have hahaha
Conan singlehandedly made The Last Dab into The Last Dip and Sip, delivered an impromptu treatise while suffering, expounding on the nature of comedy, the importance of reading widely and appreciating the classics and dared anyone to take the crown. ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED??!? *wing drop*
Best show ever......
How did he cheat the system??? Did he laminate his mouth or something lol
Ther are others that went aggressive against the wings for ego or pride, and there is conan doing it all for the comedy, just like the three stogies as he mentioned.
Eminem PLS
Wow!!!! Best episode ever
Legend.
That's not a hair. Do that's a hair don't
best show ever , haaaaaa
That was fantastic in every way
Amazing! When he asked that last question I immediately thought of Don Quixote.
I love Conan so much. What a legend. He makes great content. That's what he does. Bravo. So glad I clicked on this video
😂💞
Honestly, this is why I like Conan over a lot of talk show hosts. The Guy commits.
Conan you dropped this 👑🍗
Meh DJ Khaled was better
please bill hader
Amazing
This was... something else. A kind of experience that I've never had and probably will never get to feel something like it ever again. Wow. How?
this should be the series finale. no one will ever top this performance
Still won't mention Leno by name. Lol. Good for conan, way to stick to your guns!!!!
I have never had more respect for Conan than at this moment. What an animal.
Best episode ever. If we could get Gordon Ramsay with Conan that would be great
HBO saw the remotes where conan would travel and knew it was gold! We all love those!
Conan, you are my hero! 👏
Conan is the only late night talk show host I've ever cared for
Conan is the best 😂❤
Gonna be a Hot Ones Legends.
Best episode ever. Nobody will ever beat Conan.
The end shot of da bomb slowing leaking from the bottle while laying on its side during Conan speaking about reading widely is F*ING EVERYTHING!!! Love you Conan!!
this man is absolutely OUT OF HIS MIND..... i was a big fan before, but now,  HUGE fan
This episode restores my faith in humanity
The best! I love it!
LEGEND
Conan O'Brien is the GOAT. Give this man a medal.
Conan just became one of my favorite celebs, he was already awesome but this guy just blew me away
If anyone ever needs to know what "Dad Mouth" is, you can refer them to this episode
Conan took a chance on the hot spice and drank it from bottle because he had an excellent doctor by his side :-D
What did I just watch…lol
I love this man.
Superhuman Conan!!!❤❤❤
I wish his show would come back. Take out Jimmy Fallon and BRING BACK CONAN! 😭😭😭
Dr Arroyo gave me the Krieger, "Not even other kind" of doctor, feel.
Dr Arroyo putting the stethoscope on Sean's tongue was comedy gold. Conan and Jose just reminded the world of how to do funny.
Did he just take the same stethoscope he put on Sean’s tongue and stick in Conan’s mouth 😭🤣😂
What a complete OG legend. This is why he’s so successful he was made for entertainment. Even with his age he can appeal to all age groups. This is historic
How did he beat Eric Andre with the insanity
Best Hot Ones Ever Conan is a living legend
"Where did you go to medical school?"  "In 1998"  bruh 😂😂😂😂😂
I love this guy so much! 🔥
Hands down, clearly the best episode ever. By far.
Conan's lips are as red as his hair!!
Conan is a LEGEND!
Best episode yet! So much chaos
This was fantastic! I love Conan so much
😎🤟 best one ever
There are not many ppl who have gotten away with hopping on a water buffalo… a bit less respect for Conan’s brains but far more respect for Conan’s durability and toughness to mantle a couch after an injury like that! 😂😂
Conan is insane
That was wild episode for conan, I hope they bring another comedic celebrity and try out sauce. ✨
Can i like this one twice?
Best guest ever.. period.
This was inspirational to watch. Now I feel like I can do anything.
I love Conan. Great sense of humor
Best episode of all time. This should beat Gordon Ramsey
Two things that are facts: Gingers really do have a higher pain tolerance and Conan is the greatest of Hot Ones.
Gather around children and watch the king of comedy. Take notes cause there will be a pop quiz at the end! Bow down to this man and give him all the props.... no i mean it ALL the props!!!!!!!!!!
i dont think thats a real doctor
He’s a hero
What a Master.
I’ve always loved Conan and this is next level
The jokes being screamed from the restroom later had to have been glorious.
He remains steadfast keeping the tradition of the woodpecker pompadour alive.
Man, he has such good energy for the show! Amazing lol! Love it!
That was epic man🤣🤣🤣
Quite possibly the best Hot Ones yet...
The episode we didn't need and still dont
Dude, this was the second most dangerous thing he's ever done! The first was interviewing a homeless man at 2:00 am in the Kansas City airport in one of his first episodes of his first show!
The best episode. No question
Conan is a legend. This episode just cemented it in my mind.
Now that's entertainment folks need way more energy like this ❤❤❤❤❤
Most disgusting thing I've seen!
I've never laughed this hard at an interview
Awesome! Conan is on😅this will. Be fun.
So forced, with every chicken wing in the pocket
By FAR the best episode of hot ones so far. Conan is one committed comedian, that's for sure.
Conan esta loco
I think Conan coming onto your show and telling you you’re good at your job is the modern day equivalent to Carson telling a comedian to come over to the couch and join him for a moment.   Absolutely great stuff all around. A modern show that gave us glimpses into Conan of the past and what made/makes him great!
BEST SHOW EVER
i'm doing maint on my van on apr 18th and it's Conans bday and his new special. truly an awesome day.
He’s a maniac 😂
🌶️Big Wings🍗       🔥More Power🔥 😏Hotter Hot Pockets🤬
Best. Episode. Ever!!!!!!
Best of the best.  Laughed so hard. Such a hit.
What an absolute legend ❤
24:16 went from so profound to absolute delerium 😂 24:37 on to the end even seemed like something from Rick and Morty it was so unhinged
Conan is the best!
What a legend
HBO Max Weinberg and the HBO Max Weinberg 7
Conan is the GOAT of interviewers and interviewees.
The best episode ever!!!
best episode ever
And I thought Steve-o was a bit extreme 😂
hahahyahahahahahah
Oh God, I watched it twice!! So funny, Conan still has it
Conan is a Legend. Period.
🐐
Legendary guest this was an awesome episode
His show will save me. I’ve been going through a rough patch lately
When he started talking about comedy in old books I immediately recalled all of the times Norm Macdonald told 80 year old jokes on Conan's show.
Conan this is not enough SPICE!
That was the most hilarious thing I've ever seen
22:46 reads Sad Clown
OH MY GOD, I thought Jennifer Lawrence was the best this season could get, but Conan O’Brien just topped everything I’ve ever SEEN on Hot Ones. Holy mother of god my face hurts.
Hahahaaa
Gotta take da bomb out of the mix and make more of the focus on the last dab
Conan is my all-time favourite talk show host, i always go back to his old videos 😭
No one will ever top this, most will be too scared to try.... As they should be. You don't beat Conan
after this, i see him as the type of guy who would pay to be stepped on.js
This is the, by far, the best episode yet. No status, no fear, and no sense from Conan
There's a new no. 1.
It fuckihg happened
The only real person in hollywood
Ghandi borrowed a lot from Popeye
Can we get Dr. Arroyo on the next season please?
Brooo I love Conan so much!! Love the descent into madness and Dr. Arroyo... Best episode ever imo
GREATEST OF ALL TIME!!!!!
Coco still got beef with Jay Leno? That’s hilarious.
The shot of all the hot sauces pouring out on the table near the end is the perfect representation for this interview. Absolutely historic.
Conan is an animal!
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!
This is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. When he guzzled the Bomb, I about fell out of my chair laughing.
Conan! dude, you haven’t lost a thing, you’re still hilarious and we ALL miss you!
He's quite the showman.
You know who I'd love to see as a guest, Joaquin Phoenix. I mean, he'd never do it, but my god would it be awesome.
the guy humiliated those sauces
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟💎💎💎💎💎
So this is what the opposite of the DJ Khaled episode is.
Conan the greatest, living legend ...
Conan is hilarious. I clicked so quickly!🎉
complains about it being not hot, yet the line up is a weak one the bomb is near the end instead of near middle, its a weaker line up most likely chosen for him.
jesus so boring :/
legendary
Conan is an absolute king 😂
Conan truly is the late night goat
Jesus is coming soon repent of your sins and turn to him for he loves you like no else he want you to spend eternity in heaven with him
Anyone else remember his skit back in the day where he would go “In the year 2000!”Conan’s always been hilarious!
my Fav Conan interview! and fav Hot Ones episode. SO funny
What an amazing interview.
Has anyone checked in on Conan since this? Is he ok? Genuinely concerned fan here lol
Sorry. I despise him. He makes me want to puke with his low class 'jokes'. This was a persona not a real person which is what I want to see from this show. Maybe I just don't understand him.
never laughed so hard in my life.. this was so amazing... conan is the best....
Conan truly is a genius. Multiple running jokes throughout the show that hit every time, topped off with endless drool pooling down his face after the final wing. This really was a perfect guest his comedic timing is great
Love Conan! By far my favorite interview!
sean, why didnt you rub hot sauce on your nips? thats the real question.
My 🐐 Episode
Best Hot Ones ever??? Certainly Top 3 IMO
Laughed incredibly hard and really enjoyed the interview 😂
Man!! Conan and Craig Ferguson were the best hosts ever!!!
Usually it’s the wings but this time Conan brought the heat
So far my favorite guest
OKAY. That Da Bomb sauce pour for extra on the wing and then licking of the wing??! Conan cemented himself as the GOAT. No shot. He's the best ever.
Did Conan died?
Sean never shows fear throughout this show, but at 22:54 he's actually looking somewhat concerned after that display of masochism from Conan.
Best guest ever:)
Legend.
Oh man that was hilarious.
Conan channeled his inner Robin Williams for this appearance
His final speech with snot and spit coming out his face is the best moment ever on this show.
Absolutely unhinged in the best way - the Conan way.
Tabarnak!!!
Wings in pocket not funny at all.
Came here to see if he would talk about Norm. I miss Conan and Norm so much. But this week I’m feeling especially emotional because I’m also missing OJ. What a wonderful person, never met anyone with anything bad to say about OJ
I love Conan.  This episode is pure, unfiltered Conan and I'm so glad I witnessed this.
😂😂😂 one of the best guests I've seen to date
Hahahahaha wow Conan is the man
The MVP of all time right here! Best episode ever!
End it here! It's over. There's nowhere left to go!  This man is arguably more relevant than ever, and that other host hasn't been relevant in years. History has a way of righting itself.
He’s washing his hands in it!
Haha this will go down in hot ones history.
Conan is the GOAT
psychotic king
wow... that was incredible
The chicken wing into the Dr's pocket killed me
Conan went full Billy Crystal at the end of this
It’s Conan’s world and we’re so fortunate to live in it
I love Conan so much.
prolly the best one ive ever seen ...conan is the Hot Ones LEGEND ....
Hands down the best episode ever!!
Out of all the guests, of course it was Conan who not just one upped but completely destroyed the Hot Ones challenge. 😂 Legend. I still remember randomly tuning into the Late Night Show with Conan O Brien back in the day when I was a kid and falling in love with his hilarity.
He is indeed a Professional.  I hope he got just such Professional medical care afterwards.  Sweet Jesus, that will never be outdone.
This is the most chaotic thing I've seen in a LONG time
WOW! That was a *GREAT* episode and great guest! Conan O'Brian is a new level or respect from me!
The best of the best . A complete God of comedy
This is better than Gordon
Conan put a great show ♥ Love it. He knows what he doing and Sean love it too :D
...Did Conan O'Brien just make every other guest look like DJ Khaled?
Thanks Conan.  My relationship ended today. I really needed these laughs.
Popeye,  Ghandi and Conan.  The holy trinity.  What a ride.
bro Conan is a nut and I love him
I haven’t laughed this hard in a while. I’m crying😂
GOAT
Conan is the GOAT!
"Why can't I feel anything?" "I'm fine I'm fine"
What a legend
Nobody is ever going to top this
Amazing.   Wow.
As funny as it is nauseating
"Was it a four year school?" "It was supposed to be.." 🤌
"Was it a four year school?" "It was supposed to be.." 🤌
This one is awesome 😂😂😂😂
This is godtier
Oh my god this was the funniest episode. Conan fried his digestive tract for entertainment, and i am entertained af.
thats a pro
Was his dr having stage fright? I’d walk out if he’s my patient with that dismissive attitude. Not nice Conan!☹️
Such a wonderful surprise to have José Arroyo as the Cherry-Pepper on top of THE most red-hot "Hot Ones" episode ever, and clearly forever hottest one 🌶🌶🌶 Well done, Señor O'Brien!!! Many noches de pasión, for sure!!!
Conan's comedy is a freaking tank. Not one derail.
What a LEGEND!
This one is going to be tough to beat.  The funniest & best episode yet.
Man, Conan took it like an OG champion
Conan, what is best in Life? To crush my hot sauces, see them empty before me and to pocket half eaten wing bones!
wow, he really stepped up the insanity ... 🤣10/10 legend
This man is an artist. I've reached the point where I've stopped crying from laughter and I cried because it was beautiful. This man is so pure.
What an episode!!🎉😂
i want an uncut version so bad
conan the goat, short and simple
THIS HAD ME CLAPPING AT THE END WITH THE WHOLE TEAM AT THE END
I actually involuntarily covered my eyes when conan was drinking from the bottles. The things he does to be funny.... no one else like him.
Wow. Possibly the best hot ones ever! Incredible.
Huh.  Conan is even more unhinged than I thought, which I didn't even realize is possible.
Sean needs to go on Conan’s podcast and do 5 wings with Conan and Jordan
living legend right there
Best one yet
Amazing
best episdoe and guest since the show started.  and i hope I am just as spunky and alive as Conan is when i hit my 60's.   be proud. this episode will go down as the best episode of any type of media.
da bomb, otherwise known as Conan’s lip plumping staple.
I don't know... Conan seemed to honestly have a breakdown here. This was not good for him. All I got was anger and frustration that he even had to be there.
He's a king
This was almost Eric Andre unhinged
The best episode ever
That was so disgusting. But I was highly entertained. 😂
Best interview!!!!!
I'm in tears! Conan is THE King!
The universe needs to protect Conan at all costs..
Asking for permission and then putting chicken wing into the pocket bit is genius
Conan killed Bea Arthur!!!!!
Steve-O has NOTHING on this....HOLY S***!!!
Conan is king
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏✊✊✊ you are a dog Sir.
Truely amazing
Conan is cracked out of his mind.
This was incredible
Best episode ever! This guy is crazy
Epic
I think Conan is the only guest that really beat this challenge 😂 bro ate the sauces like it was nothing
Genuinely concerned for Conan's wellbeing after this.
One of the best episodes 😂😂😂
😂😂😂 ohhh Conan please never changes. People can get a lot of memes in  this interview😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Conan is pure comic genius!!!!
Best episode!!
I like Dr Arroyo. I trust him.
NO ONE HAS DONE IT LIKE THIS MAN AND NO ONE EVER WILL!  You know Conan is probably my favorite comedian right now besides Robin Williams RIP and never knew he had the same birthday as me. You learn something new just about everyday.
Poor next guess… 😅
Can you imagine Conan and Will Farrell in the same space.
Conan is a gem!
new best hot ones episode of all time
video started, that he saying its nothing but his eyes are burning 5:30 look at him
1 in billion kind of human. true showman
The dedication to a bit is unparalleled.
Of course he was the best guest ever. God tier performance
Compared to Conan Gordon Ramsay Was A Bitxh
move over, steve-o! there‘s a new madman in town!
DJ Khalid: "Congratulations, you played yourself."
14:00 when he swigs the sauce, I had tears from laughing so hard
The new king 👑
Best one! Conan crushed it!
True GOAT
I love hot ones but the background music is cheesy at times
I love Conan
WHAT A FKIN LEGEND
Do you think you can bring Conan O’Brien to your show and not watching him taking control of it ?
It's crazy how Sean Evans looks so vanilla as a host compared to Conan. Sean's certainly got something to learn, asking thoughtful questions will only get you so far
Haven't seen Sean look that worried since Coolio. 😂
One of y'alls best episodes. Bravo to you and Conan.
Best episode ever!
Absolutely fantastic
Conan is everywhere. Love it.
Jesus Christ Conan is the daddy of hot sauce
One of the best Episodes ever
I was lucky enough catch the tale end of Johnny Carson, and be in my  late teens when Conan got his show. I stuck with him until the Tonight Show debacle.
This is the best hot ones episode, and I'm not even surprised
on my books this tops Gordom's interview hahaha so funny, this man is a true savage
Conan just put on the greatest EVERYTHING to ever be recorded in the  history if EVER
The only way they can top this episode is if they bring out Schlansky.
Underrated Conan was the best late night talk show host.
This is comedy gold!
7:00 praise from Caesar
the one time he could have provided useful information... he says read the bible.
Watching Conan go from Mere Mortal to full-on Red Dragon really is something.
Theres's something about Mary with Conan's hair-do.
there is no way this ISN'T the greatest episode of Hot Ones
"How's my pulse?" "It's there."
Conan, the GOAT of Hot Ones hands down! F’n savage!
One of the greatest late night show hosts ever gives Sean the highest praise at 7:00.  Very cool and very well deserved!
It's pretty cut and dry to say you really should just cut the cord and call it a wrap on Hot Ones.  You'll never be able to get close to topping this episode. In the words of George Costanza GO OUT ON A HIGH NOTE.
This is Doing Katt Williams Numbers!
CAMPEÓN!!! 💪🏽
Conan went full Super Spice Saiyan
Where did you go to school?  Um, in 1998
By far the best episode yet. I forget how amazing Conan is sometimes.
Love conan
The GOAT of late night!
Finally someone actually put some sauce on the wings....
😂savage!~!!!
The fact he took the time to answer a question with the recognition of his dedication to this show makes him seem so much more genuine love you conan!
Been saying it for 30 years, Conan is NOT funny nor entertaining. I don't get how he had a career as a "comedian". Just wasted 10 minutes watching this before i gave up.
two and a half minutes in, pockets the remnants of a wing, "Can i keep these?" Omfg im dying already.
I love it!! Best one yet!!
I love for the second to last sauce there wasn't even a question. I don't think of ever seen Sean so blown away by the energy of a guest
This is one of the most iconic videos on the entire internet
Conan O’Fryin
23:44 as he gives his motivational speech the hot sauce bottle pouring out in front of him was a masterpiece
you should try getting a vtuder on
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Hands down best hot ones yet.
Not only did Sean and all of hot ones get high praises from one of the greatest TV show hosts of all time? Together they pulled off one of the best TV interviews in show history. Very well done!!
The fact that Conan remembers the names of cameramen and stage hands from 20+ years ago is amazing. He seems like he would be a fantastic boss and is extremely humble.
Conan absolutely tanked da bomb genuinely impressive
There have been funnier people on this show, but this was far... FAR and away... the funniest episode to date! My favorite Conan material to date as well... Good lord, I was literally howling while watching this. My dog kept checking on me.
Really enjoyed this, Conan in an extreme context and at his best!
11:56 why did my mind go straight to ‘Thats Conans stunt double’ 😂😂😂
Conan o'Brien is a savage
Unscripted Conan....is certified plantinum...😂😂😂
I love hearing Conan swear
Best.Episode.Ever. What a legend!
you got the goat
Does anyone know if there’s an episode of Conan Needs a Friend yet where he talks about this?
I knew he was a waste not want not kinda guy lol
Just wait Conan, till it all hits the bottom, literally  !!
The  best
Well this is the first episode that made me nauseous from watching Conan eat and drool and spit up food...I guess he did his job. 🤢🤮😢😅
Bill Nighy is a big fan of hot food, the brilliant actor.
sorry but the music is so lazy
Best episode by far 😂
Best episode of all! Thanks for all production! Conan was the best guest.
This was my fav episode of the season 🔥🔥🔥
Conan+ Endorphin Rush = Pure entertainment!!
Legend
Has to be my favorite guest of all time!!! Amazing showman that keeps on giving that humor!
Unhinged perfection.
First hot ones I've seen in a long while,  and first that genuinely had me laughing . Bravo boys, you still got it.🎉
Hands down!!!!!! One of the best episodes of hot ones. Conan absolutely killed it.
Can’t stand the bloke.
From here on out, everybody is going to have to use the blueprint… the bar has been raised
Best tv host in history 👌🏼
Wing drop lol
Shawn wasn't ready
Best guest
Such a legend!!!
Remember when DJ Khalid ate one wing and quit?
how can you tell a celebrity is selling something?  they appear EVERYWHERE
He destroyed the hot wings challenge
Greatest episode of Hot Ones that I have ever watched. I’ve been a Conan fan since the old days and he never disappoints.
This is my favorite hot wings episode hands down!!
Finally, Conan, a guest who does so much that Sean won't match him. Instant classic episode!
Really really adore how conan is a rare oldschool showman. "Showmanship is giving you the greatest show in the world"
He who controls the spice controls the universe - incredible show.
overly contrived and controlled... there it is, Conan O'Brien. BS
Pure Joy! Protect Conan O’Brien at all costs!!
Conan is Amazing
I want to see if Jim Carrey can top what Conan O'Brien delivered here!
Best hotones episode to date. Hands down.
22:34 Funniest man alive! "What's wrong with me? Why can't i feel?"
What a beast
I don't think I've ever laughed harder at Conan.  Definitely never laughed this hard at Hot Ones.  Guaranteed classic forever.  Favorite episode by far.
It was worth it Conan. Fantastic episode!!
this episode was so obnoxious and cringe. why do people find him funny?
The greatest 27 minutes and 21 seconds ever.
This is one of the greatest improv comedy performances I've seen!
Wait, he's not the 'Orange man bad' guy?
w...ttt.....fffffffffffff...... lol?
Funny. Poignant. Relentless. Cutting satire. Brazen self-promotion. I'm awed and exhausted. This is pure genius.
That jacket is fire, where can I buy it?
That was the best episode I've ever seen
That’s a great episode. Always great to see Conan in action
Trump and Conan 2024!
How is that even possible?  Conan is invincible.
When he started to drink the hot sauce and then smear it on his face, I lost it.  Without a doubt, my favorite episode.
No way the sauce was the real deal. Conan should have literally been on fire.
Already 4 millions views – Conan's episode is getting more hype in a day than most celebs' in years!!
Conan saying "thanks for having me" after Sean's intro like its a regular talk show ..
This man is the goat 😂😂😂😂😂
One of…maybe THE BEST episode of Hot ones. Hats off Conan!!!  Btw. I was watching this on a long night flight from Germany to India and it was very hard not to wake up other passengerd laughing so loud!!! And….the idea with the Doc was just genious!!! Thank you Conan. Thank you FWF team!
This was the best...
This is the best episode yet!!
This guy stole the whole episode.. somebody give him his own show to host people!
Ok obviously Coco is the GOAT but also... clearly he has some sort of genetic abnormality, yes? Like a capsaicin non-taster or like, his brain processes pain abnormally or something. The last dab is essentially sweetened bear mace, you shouldn't be able to have drink that and walk away, let alone be coherent.
We LOVE Conan ❤❤❤
Literally one of THE BEST guests you’ve had any season!!! Conan, that extra sauce…thank you for your service!  🌶️🫡🌶️
This was unbelievable 😂😂😂😂 Conan is an absolute legend
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan is the Goat
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Call the wife
Conan was brilliant! and the tortured look in Sean's face as he tried to keep up with Conan will go down in history...
Sitting at the Airport bar watching this and people think I'm crazy because I'm laughing the f out loud
Best episode
I dont really get the hype. This felt unbelievably staged and fake. I feel like this is antithetical to the spirit of the show
Might be the best late night host of all time
Dude is a friggin savage! I was completely mesmerised. Btw Can you get Louis CK on the show?
seans reactions to conan going in on the sauce is hilarious
Having Conan on any show is dooming the rest of it. You can’t get a better guest.
By the end Conan was acting like he was in always sunny
Gordon, Hart, Jong you were great, but there is a new number one! Thanks Conan!!
This is why his the best 😊
😂😂😂 Conan is the BEST!!!
Why were they talking about this episode on the morning news?..in Canada 😂😂 we love to see it
Best interview EVER! It literally made me tear up with laughter and joy! CONAN IS THE GOAT! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
The Goat
What's the Jacket Conan is wearing?
Conan is crazzzzzy
One of the GOATs of humour
Fade to black, RIP
lol Conan is the best 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
This man speaks for all of us when drags the name change from HBO MAX to just MAX
Conan is the embodiment of a showman. Always trying to entertain. Shoving wings in his pockets, having a “doctor” come in, smearing hot sauce on himself. Dude really is the best
i’m convinced that conan is the only good talk show host, seems like everyone else is either painfully unfunny or abusive to staff
One of the best Hot Ones
He has Toppled the best that ive seen on the show.. CHEERS to Conan!
That is my favourite episode ever now😂😂😂😂😂
One of the best!!! Have always loved Conan!!! My grandma thought he was annoying hahaha
No lie.. i fell off hot ones.... But im glad I'm still subscribed and managed to watch this one... One of the best guests
This has to be one of the best Hot Ones interviews of all time 😮
What a legend
This is without a doubt one of the best and certainly the funniest episode of this show I’ve seen.
He is the best
Awe, see, my grandma was from Boston and my grampa was from Marshfield. But he introduced me to spice when he'd make guacamole in his kitchen in Alaska when I was a kid. They toured mainland Mexico for almost a year in the sixties, and they were good cooks that picked up lots of tips.  That said, I adore this show since the first season, and I've had a HUGE crush on Conan since I was an adolescent in the 90's and he looked barely older than me, all gangly in his oversized suits.  And I was just eating the crumbs at the bottom of the Paqui Ghost Pepper chip bag ... Which I love and regularly consume because nobody else touches the bag. And I've eaten the Last Dab sauce on some tacos at a friend's house, and it's delicious and I had to put way more on.
It'll be like dropping a 40mg, when you thought it was a 10mg...Conan is ok for now, but give him 30 minutes and he'll be hating life
He’s not a good doctor, he’s an affordable one.
Rachel Ray was just usurped as the most masochistic psychopath on the show … ❤❤❤
Say you want to stand out and be a memorable guest without literally saying the words.
Shoutout to Dr Arroyo for keeping Conan safe
"I'M. FINE." - Conan O'Brien
16:27 "Da Bomb" 🔥
The most iconic episode of Hot Ones ever. Incredible. Conan is an absolute legend.
What a guy.
BRING SOFIA VERGARA 😅
David Attenborough: _Conan's approach to Hot Ones—"I don't feel it! Is this all you've got?? Give me MORE!"—was also his approach to acid in his youth. He used to be such a sweet boy... Until that faithful day where he ate two sheets in a Cookie Monster fashion... And well, he's been our "sweet lil boy" ever since... for the last 40 years..._  "Be cool ma babiess!"  David Attenborough: _And so on the set of Hot Ones, Conan _*_was cool._*_ At least so he thought..._
Second time watching this
Lisan al Gaib!
legendary
Conan’s the best
best episode ever
🤣🤣 legend
THE BEST EPISODE EVER (AND THAT'S A LOT)!
Conan is a legend. Respect the chaos and shout out to Geoffrey Chaucer!😭
Conan is one of only two people that give me this much joy. Something about him just makes me happy, just like being around someone who's company you enjoy and love. The other one was the late Robin Williams.
What a Youtube masterpiece! I was literally choking on my peanuts. Li-te-ra-ly.
Bruhhh the end was so good I ain’t laughed that hard in a while 😂😂
Best thing ever
This is the most unhinged episode I've ever seen. Conan is the GOAT
I miss Conan's show
To quote my hero Popeye, I am what I am.  Hahaha!
Conan honestly seems happier now than when he was on TBS, more comfortable, less limited. Happy for him
Love Conan and think he's one of the greatest ever, but here it's just way over the top and not very funny at all, just annoying
Perfect blend of honest, insightful answers and absolute chaos. Conan is the best
timeless!
My woman just said "Conan looks like a delusional king just about to fall..." and i can't unsee it...
4 million views in 2 days! wow! that must be a accomplishing feeling
Don’t say commit to the bit.
Amazing
This is the best most hilarious hot ones I've ever seen! 🤣🤣🤣
Well said Conan, well said. Kinda brings a tear to the eye
He makes dj Khalid look like rainbow brite
I wais reading the comments thinking, what could be so good about this one.. , but yeah - hilarious!
Greatest. Guest. Ever.
This is absolutely off the rails and incredible. It’s the only episode that can contend with Gordon Ramsay. I love it so much.
He just left me with my tongue hanging like 😮🙆🤦💀😂🤣
A legend. An absolute Legend.
I will forever remember this man stuffing wings into his pocket.
I've never seen Sean laugh so much (or heard) as the camera was focused almost entirely on Conan because his presence demanded it, and I am right there with him.  🤣 Conan just set the bar (in the ionosphere!)
Conan is the man, nothing gets in his way of a comedy bit
Best guest ever! 😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
Pretty sure Conan was having a painful visit to the toilet the next day...
that was completely epic! respect Conan! ive had a bottle of the pepper x and its good, but not in large doses. this has to be one of the best episodes imo. Conan is a legend and always going the extra mile. love it   seeing Conan do the one chip challenge would be interesting
Easily top 10 Hot Ones episodes
This was just FANTASTIC! What a guy!
Do you ever feel like the guests is critiquing your hosting abilities, this might be the one.   The best ever. Well this took a turn.
I think you should end the show, it wont get any better than this.
Connan and stev-o must be together in each other's shows and together on hotones
Incredible
Welcome our next guest, Covid O'Brien
Conan is a legend in everything he does, lol.
What's he done to his face! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conan is so based
Conan the Barbarian ! He was great !
😂😂😂 love this so much
The best episode.
How?
Best guest in the shows history
Some Chris Farely vibes
Have to comment. What an absolute gem.
Man I miss conan on tv really wish he would return with Andy of course
The meeting your idol joke was hilarious
P2 please
Incredible. Conan is just incredible! When Conan asked his Dr to come over and put the wing in his pocket 🤣.  And the Stooges reference. God I love him!
Everything is better with Conan 😂
Thats a WRAP! BEST EPISODE EVER. 🥵🔥🌡🌶
This was the best one lol
I have watched this over 10 times. 😂
Conan had an opportunity to say “This just isn’t going very well, is it?” It would have blown the roof off that place.
Legend
Conan got high on Hot spice and acted it out as if an Emmy was on the line.
Pure Gonzo
The sauces need The Merciless Peppers of Quetzalacatenango
Can anyone tell me what # hot sauce in the lineup that was
I guess you can eat it AND wear it
@23:00 new meme incoming
Conan is a beast.
Love Conan. Ending music reminds me of Jurassic Park
Coco is the 🐐
Conan was like no Sean this my show I make the Rules absolute legend
I dont believe there was hot sauce in there he gets a tummy ache from eating wheat bread
Best episode best guess. History is made. Hilarious five stars two thumbs up. Someone give conan a trophy. Well done
I have watched and enjoyed hot ones for many years. I have to say I don't remember an episode that had me laughing this hard. Pure absolute gold.
It’s a weird feeling…but Conan makes me kinda proud of the American people, of our culture, despite our problems and so many things that we need to be doing better about.  He’s an artist, extremely smart, the rare type of comedian who can make anyone laugh no matter where you’re from or what you’ve been through. I feel like he knows things about comedy on a level he’s intentionally never showing us, like some redhead Irish guru meditating on a mountaintop of comedy.
Conan knowing all the details of Warren Harding at a moments notice is the most impressive piece of all of this 😅
Best episode ever
It's wild that Conan O' Brien successfully navigated a near 30-year career as a terrific comedian/interviewer, and said "Y'know what? I'm 60, time to retire from my job to pursue my passion, being an even more terrific comedian/interviewer"...
Greatest part when his inner-Irish slowly starts to come out after pocketing a wing. All downhill from there…
How do you do an interview like this and not mention The Simpsons even once?
This is my first episode of the show and I almost passed out more'n once. All in for more :D
Is he meant to be funny?
Guest Conan is BEAST
"You're dumber after watching the show" lol Conan is perfect
Conan is the best to ever do it! 😂 legend
Conan is unbelievable
Da Bomb grounds EVERYONE
Ice Spice made the show crawl to have Conan make it explosive
F'ing Conan!
The BEST!!
And the Oscar goes to......Conan O'Brian!
Man if those sauces are legit then this is a seriously impressive performance. Just powering through that much spice is not easy.
Conan O'Brien, thank you for existing. Thank you for the decades of pure comedy, it is a privilege.
Easily the best guest on the show.  Conan will forever reign supreme.
Conan, greatest guest ever!
Best episode ever!!!  Conan set the bar!!!
By FAR the best episode! 🤣
My god Conan is an absolute legend. Drinks the hot sauce and douses the wings in it.
Best hot ones ever
He’s insane 😂🤣🤣🤣😂
I think Conan coated his mouth and throat in candle wax before the camera started rolling.
Love Conan so much. Him being here is everything I imagined.
this was unexpectedly awesome
If you’re gonna get late night show hosts on this show you might as well invite the best of the best: Craig Ferguson!
The motivational inspiring music works perfectly with Conan's speech.
By far my favourite episode, what a legend, hahaha
Conan O'Brien is absolutely the most genuinely, naturally funny person to have ever lived!! I love that guy!
When Conan says "Max" it must mean Weinberg so that just confuses me
The part where he just lets all the milk out at the end was very Tim and Eric
Conan took “spice must flow” a little too literally
This may be the greatest one of all time, i nearly fell out of my chair like five times!
An insane person
This episode is gold!! Conan is a mad genius!!
Ngl Conan is a true showman.   THE SHEER PROFESSIONALISM.
Conan goes right to the top of Hot swings alongside Gordon Ramsey.
25:35 fin.
22:31 so Conan’s assistant once said, and was backed up by Andy, that he will literally do anything purely for the sake of getting laughs. Even if it was just him trying to make her laugh, he’d work just as hard for that as he would to entertain entire audiences and I think this is pretty much the perfect encapsulation of her point lol
There's a legit case to be made that Conan is the funniest man to ever live.
I never laughed so hard during an episode. Conan is the new Hot Ones GOAT! 🤣🤣🤣
I can’t stop rewatching this… Conan’s the best!!
Would love to see Eminem on this!
The best episode there has ever been and ever will be. Masterful.
Wow. He blew Gordon Ramsey's preformance out of the water.
The whole refusing to say Jay's name and pretending to not know what he was doing is beautiful.
I'm going to bookmark this and rewatch it every year. Conan is as funny as ever.
So this is how I find out I share a birthday with Conan
This is the best episode of the entire show. No topping this one.
Conan is really pulling out his hopping on the water buffalo spirit here, and no one is going to doubt his dedication for putting on a show now.
This has to be the best one. Conan is the greatest.
BEST HOT ONES I'VE EVER WATCHED🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan's "way over the top isn't high enough" approach will never stop being great
Slobbering!!
BEST GUEST EVER!!!!!
“Why can’t I feel!?”…I felt that 😭
Conan is the funniest man on the planet
That was the best hot ones ever 😂😂
Really appreciated the water buffalo animated sequence in lieu of footage.
Conan- "feel for the pulse" Doctor- "it's there" Conan- "he's very good" 😂😂 💀
We all witnessed a legendary episode! What a gem this was to watch. I'M FINE!!!!
Anybody got eyes on Sean’s jacket? I want to buy one
Instantly the best episode of Hot Ones and that's saying a lot.
Him, almost calmly, explaining why eating extra da bomb sauce was a bad idea is so funny to me and is such a juxtaposition to how he’d been behaving up to that point. I’ve had to pause it to cackle 😂😂
THE WILDEST HOT ONES EPISODE IN THE HISTORY OF YOUTUBE
This is the complete opposite of the Ice Spice episode
Random guest request. Chad Smith, drummer for the chili peppers. That guy is cool af
Man Doctor Arroyo, that was so funny. Well done Hot Ones and Conan!
I have never laughed so hard during a hot ones video. Conan is FOREVER an all time great.
I love the fact that this interview exponentially derails and escalates into total madness and at the end you don't even know why you're laughing. You just do.  Shoutout to Conan for pushing the show into some insane limits!
Conan is the best to ever do it.
CALL THE WIFE 😂😂😂😂
Best episode ever
Conan is the beast.
“The other guy”  subtle jab at Jay Leno
BEST EPISODE EVER <3
Conan is the Goat 🐐 a little extra but funny AF 💀🤣
Thats the way, brilliant 🤣
This is a serious contender for most views on Hot Ones. Conan coming for Gordon’s throne!
“Was it a 4 yr medical school?”  “It was supposed to be”
I have never laughed so hard and felt so scared at the same time!! THE best interview so far!!
We need john stewart
Two phrases I never thought I would be yelling at the screen: "Don't do it!!" and "How is he doing this?!" This segment perfectly defines the LEGEND that is Conan O'Brien. Legend.
ok, I will watch every episode of his show. this is dude here man. wow.
This is the best one yet. Fantastic!
The bar has been raised.
Ghandi, Popeye... And I. Lol
I thought no one could beat Paul Rudd. Conan was a joy to watch.
😂😂 best final 😂😂
Conan O’Brien is by far the best guest on this show so far
LEGEND!!
Conan knows content 💥
I don’t think Conan realizes he is a part of the comedy class that he adores. True legend, poor Sean didn’t stand a chance of pulling out any  Sean questions. 10/10 episode, instant classic without being a typical classic Hot Ones episode.
A LEGEND
0:33 uhhhhh can't wait to Pirate that
Man, Conan made the show fun...... Conan O'Brien thanks
imagine if he forgot about the wings in the pocket. there'd be some pretty noticeable skeletons in his closet.
😂😂😂
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?!? WHY CAN'T I FEEEEEL????
Epic
Yes ... for sure....going down in Hot Ones history... as the best episode ever!!!  I can say with all confidence...  that this episode will never be topped!!! 💯  I had to  come back and  leave this comment ... as I have been laughing in my head for the past few days since I watched the episode!!  Conan really outdid himself!  Always loved him... always will! 🤩🥰🔥 Congrats on having the best guest ever Sean!!! 😁😉  Cheers from Ontario, Canada 🍁
man I love Conan O'Brian
Full respect for all those pours BUT it was so gross to watch. I'm not one to want it to be pretty but it was totally disgusting to look at.
legend
We have reached the pinnacle of comedy. Nothing will top this.
Best episode of hot wings ever!
I definitely thought at the end of the video that there was going to be a HotOnes betting platform 😂
By far the most chaotic episode of hot ones yet lol. I was dying laughing through out the entire episode
i love conan so much my dad and i used to stay up late just watch him when i was younger. i love him so much and he still such a gem ❤
Best one by far
I thought i would never breathe again. Funniest hot ones I have ever seen
Agreed with the comments saying this was a comedic masterclass. It was also a masterclass in how to be a guest on a show. Be prepared. Be interesting. Be memorable. So many celebrities are jaded and bored and make sure they will not be invited back.  Sean Evans will never forget this episode, and with almost 4 million views in under 3 days, Conan has brought a huge amount of exposure to Hot Ones. The money coming in from the views alone has got to be a real boon to the show. But more impressively, Conan balanced his wacky antics with being a good guest, answering questions honestly and paying heartfelt compliments to Sean and crew.  To all those who say Conan is a psychopath, you just don't get it.
Take your like and comment, push this thing to Trending #1 for gods' sake 👏
"it's there" LAMAO
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Epic.
I'm scared of this guy istg
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Holy 💩!!! 😂😂😂
OH MYYYYYY GOD!! CONAN IS A BEEEEEAST!!! BEST GUEST EVER! CANT WAIT FOR HIS MAX SHOW!!
"I am what I am" - Conan, Popeye, and Ghandi
hands down one of the most entertaining episodes. conan is a beast
Conan went full nick cage
This is the best hot ones show Ive seen 😂😂😂😂
When Flaming C refers to his colon!
Conan will always have a special place in my heart
I wished sean participated a lil more compared to the goat
I was so excited even seeing the promo for this. This is electric, and for me an absolute "I was born at exactly the right time" moment. Incredible finale from an incredible team.
Sean looks so terrified. 😂😂😂😂😂
Next Jordan Schlansky please...
Conan the goat of late night , all these other ones are just political activists , they lost the plot a long time ago , iv spent hundreds of hours watching your content Conan , always be number 1 .
8mins in, and I haven't laughed this much in 27 years
This is the best episode of Hot Ones ever
Phenomenal
CONAN IS THE GREATEST.......!!!!!!!!
Connan is a diamond in the Rough
Conan O'Brien is a hero of the people. May he rest in peace.
My god!
I think I've never had so many emotions watching a video here.
Greatest talk show host of our time.
😳
is this the greatest episode of all time? Yes
And the winner of Hot Ones is...
To be honest I didn't even know Hot Ones was back. I just looked through the past few episodes and let me tell ya, Conan is still a star. 4 millions views in 2 days.
Imagine every guest who's been on the show and they're watching Conan, knowing exactly what each sauce tastes like. Man, they are probably more impressed than we are. Excellent season finale, Sean.
I had sympathy diarrhea after watching this episode.   [Conan!!! Best ep. EVER!]
Conan became one with the hot sauce
Best one yet 🤣
I wish I lived in the timeline where Conan’s Tonight Show was still going.
23:00 Has a lot of meme/GIF potential.
So good to hear waneee wannaaa.......... after a longtime
GD!!   Leave it to Conan to answer the most inspiring exit question  AND the most EPIC Red Carpet Roll Out!!🤣🤣   I think that is the most entertained SEAN has been on this show!
Goat
Has anyone checked on Conan since the show to make sure he's still alive?? 🤣
Watching this sped up is a trip.
I’ve never worried about the safety of a guest, and I’ve seen Steve-o on here. Lol
Conan is one of the greatest comedians of all time and he keeps proving time and time again why he is the goat!
Conan is a living legend. God bless him. A pure entertainer ❤
Ngl he surprised tf outta whites and everyone with that Super tolerance for spice
THIS ONE DESERVES SO MANY AWARDS 😂😂😂
watched it twice back to back. This guy is a master of his craft. starts slow then goes 100miles per hour.
Conan gives my geriatric dog anxiety
Don't people with red hair have problems with freezing re dental procedures?
This one will go down in the First We Feast hall of fame!
1
😂 Legend.
What an absolute king 👑
Here I came to see the pastiest man alive get devoured by hot sauces only to be humbled and bow to the king of hot wings.
Best way to promote his new show haha. April 18th 🫵 on MAX.
Conan is the best ever
The fake sobbing and munching the wings just hilarious hahaha
Every time Conan just says Max my brain wants to assume he’s talking about Max Weinberg.
GOAT O'Brien
My favorite talk show host. I am 34 and remember watching him as a kid. Yes, he was goofy and silly but that's HIM! In 2008 during the writer's strike, Conan leaned into it and was STILL extremely entertaining. People forget he used to write for The Simpsons. He's an underrated skit writer and a great talk show host. He could play goofy and be the center of attention... but he can also be quiet and play the straight guy to let the guest flourish. Look at his interviews with Norm Macdonald. I have so much respect and admiration for this guy. It would be an honor to meet him.
That was hilariously epic! One of the best shows ever!
I love Conan… I love Conan.
Paging Dr Creepy Guy....
Conan Obrien for the next Joker movie😂
Absolute legend
Norm McDonald and Conan were hilarious together.
topped the Coolio dab
might as well end the show. You're not going to top this, ever!
Dude started with a bit. True comedian.
Conan is someone who has made me laugh so hard i cried.  No other talk show host does this.  And he did not disappoint as by the end of it all.....laughing to tears.   😂😂😂
Watching this 2 days late but gotta say; Conan O'Brien is simply the best. Best Hot Ones to date.
I thought Connan was going to die after pouring the bomb on the wing and licking it 😂😂😂
Haven't even watched it yet.  And i cant stop laughing.  I LOVE CONAN
wow this was just amazing!!!!! best guest best internet moment!!!
never 'disrespect' da bomb. ps: please stay alive!
Hatsoff Conan.. what an awesome show !!
The only thing more fire than Conan's remotes is the dump he took the next day
Conan is in a league of his own. A true living legend.
This is as close as we are ever gonna get to getting Chris Farley on hot ones. Chris would have fell through the table too tho
MAN Conan really goes HARD, Something i can respect in man. No wonder he became, who he became. A LEGEND.
Watching Conan drink the last dab and remembering DJ Khaled tapping out early
4 years tops, is wild
Conan having so much energy makes me have energy
Baseline pulse: "It's there." That's good writing.
@joeRogan...comedy...
Dr Arroyo is my Dr. I pay him cash and see him in an office at the back of a Walmart. Actually, I think it's the employee break room. I can attest that he's good... And very affordable.
Conan has officially lost it! LUNATIC! Can't say it wasn't entertaining though. Talk about commitment!
This is the greatest episode of Hot Ones ever made
That’s professional commitment right there.
Epic motivational speech. Face plastered with hot sauce and chicken flesh. GOAT.
Season 23? What does that even mean?? What is a season anymore?? What??? ?????
Wow Conan’s got some mad tolerance
Goat episode
Conan is the only American talk show host I've really found funny. As a Brit I always found Craig Ferguson funny
Conan is the best.
Finally a celebrity who looks like a real human being after eating wings 🤣
This was great Conan showing his comedic skills in a different environment awesome stuff.
In terms of physical prowess, this tops that time Johnny Carson played the accordion while balancing, on his head, two senior citizens sitting on a bench.
I absolutely adore Conan O'Brien
This is impressive. What a commitment. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Conan the GOAT. Love and respect from India
Instantly on my Mt Rushmore of Hot Ones legends! Possibly the greatest one yet! Conan had me rolling lol
Best interview ever. Love Conan.
That’s the hardest I’ve laughed watching this show
23:17 probably the most important part for any aspiring comedic entertainers
By far the best episode
Oh god ,i loveeeeeee conan!!❤
06:21 "The other guy" 😂  Or, "f you, Jay Leno".
Best interview I've seen on this channel.
Best episode of all time. Insanity.
Conan should be cloned and his clones put on the front lines 😂😂 what a beast lol
EPIC
I was excited when I saw Conan was going to be the guest and did not disappoint. Definitely the best episode I've seen so far.
So glad to see him in studio live, what a great entertainer
As an OG Conan fan, I knew this would be good but it definitely surpassed what I could even have imagined 😭 I am so glad he’s going to have more eyes on him now because he’s truly an unsung comedy genius of our time!!!
April 18 on Max guys 😂🎉 let’s support him!!
KING! All hail Conan!
best hot wings episode ever
i won’t be the same
Da Bomb is no joke! That’s the one hot sauce I haven’t finished. In fact, I’ve only used a dab. LOL Conan is a f$&king legend! Protect this man at all cost!!!😂💪🏼
Bwahahaha awsome!
Sean sounded a bit down in the beginning? Not as energetic. He didn’t laugh at any of Conan’s jokes either. I wonder if they clashed before filming or something
6:24 "... the other guy" :D He is talking about Jay Leno. He who must NOT be named!
This is the best «Hot one’s» interview I have seen! And I never seen Sean laugh so much and genuinely before..  this goes down as my favorite episode by far!
Hands down my #1 favorite episode of the entire show🎉❤what a lovely closeout for the season❤
That was the greatest episode of all time!! Conan was hilarious! I have tears in my eyes from laughing so hard! 😂
Utter Madness 😂. Loved it ❤
RIP Conan's colon.
New fan. (Gen z)
LEDGEND 😂😂😊 👏🏻 👏🏻
That was the best
The truth!!!
Legitimately one of the greatest human beings to ever exist.
That is why I love Conan more than all the other talk show hosts. The man is unique, one of a kind, and sacrifices to make something new. Man, you are the best!!!
Speechless
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥BEST EPISODE EVERRRRRRR 🎉🎉🎉🎉
This was the greatest episode of hot ones I've ever seen
What a guest!!! 😂🎉
Best show, and best episode ever ❤!!! Saw it couple times w family 😅😅😅😅 conan is the best!!! Now bring the rest !!
The end  felt like one of those interdimensional cable shows.
Nice to see Conan on Youtube...? 😬
This episode knocked DJ Khalids’ #1 spot, it was hilarious!!!
The best episode you guys have ever made. Conan is one of a kind, glad to have you back man.
I would love to meet Conan . I love this man. Much respect❤
Epic
Conan = 🐐
Conan needs to come back TOMORROW in a wheelchair as an old man, stating how now he knows why his people eat bland foods.
🔥 🏆 👑
God Bless this man. Protect him at all costs.
Conans crazy XD hahaha great episode :D
might be the best hot ones episode to date
Conan is a savage 🤣 🤘💪
Best episode ever!
Oh Conan, we love you ❤
I feel like he turned into the Joker on the Murray show at the end.
Best. Hot ones. Ever.
Love that Conan gave Sean his well-deserved flowers by complimenting his interview style while adding so many comedic layers to this interview.  Dr. Arroyo was a riot and you can literally hear Sean breaking up trying to keep up with Conan who was basically on a suicide mission 😆 He was feeling that after for sure.
The subtle switch from water to milk after Da Bomb had me rolling. I have a feeling his "I'm feeling it just peek through" went on for a long while as reality crept through like  the hematoma from the water buffalo.
Conan is the only golden poster child for inbreeding- it's like his near 100% Boston Irish Catholic roots doubled down and made him truly not recognize spice or spice pain. A chili warrior with flaming red hair. So awesome
Where did you go to medical school? Eh 1998.
Please make Conan the next Jack Sparrow.
Easily the best episode I've ever seen.
CONAN DA BOMBARIAN
by far the best episode
This is legitimately one of the best performances in the history of Hot Ones. If there's a Hot Ones Mount Rushmore, then Conan O'Brien is on it front and center.
This is cinema
I always drop the "I am what I am." To the missus when I do something 'embarrassing' to her. This was great. Conan is great as always.
da bomb gets everyone lol
Genuinely the best hot ones performance of all time. He’s the Larry Bird of Hot Ones guests.
Finally we got the man, the legend. Love this dude
Sona! Step in!
Conan just made the best Hot Ones!!!!!!!!!!
100% i wouldn't have been able to hold myself together if I was in Sean's seat
This senior citizen put to shame so many young ones! That was awesome.
Man that was the best episode ever !!!!!
Wings got So spicy that Farley came out of him a bit. Lol
I haven't watched hot ones in a while but I HAD to come back for Conan lol great ep. Conan is a madman.
I miss him hosting Late Night so much
Conan is the man ✊️👏
“It’s not a bit, this is life!” - Conan, 2024.
I ran 4K watching this. Laughed most of the way! 😂👍🏼😂
Possibly the G.O.A.T Episode!! Go Big or go Home✅ Hilarious ✅ Hot Sauce Rage✅
this is what filthy frank would have done.
Conan O’Brien is a comedic genius. 😂
ICONIC.
Conan making fun of Max was my favorite!!  “HBO was too popular”  Five ⭐️’s Sean & Conan!
Conan is an Animal!!!😂
Conan did not disappoint. in my opinion hes the best guest of all time
This is the most fun I see Sean had in the show
CONAN FOR PRESIDENT!!!
But where,You should go! 😅 Killed me.
this is insane.
When he started pouring Da Bomb sauce on the wing and licking the entire wing, i sincerely started worrying for his health. That stuff is no joke. Then it just made him lose his mind and turn up the insanity to 11. This was the wildest hot ones in a long time
Greatest episode of all time
I ran to the toilet for Conan.
Power over spice is power over all.
Conan was the Best!!!! Leno a legend but Conan was the best
Honestly? I would vote for him to be a president. Better than what we have now
CONAN IS THE KING OF HOT ONES ! ! !  Shawn, whatever you do next, know that you peaked in this episode
Best hot ones to date
I think is safe to say that nothing will beat this man’s performance
Conan and Eric Andre are both Aries and their episodes are VERY similar to say the least 😭😂♈️
This is the BEST guest you've ever had on the show by far
THE BEST episode.  There ever could be.  Dave Grohl was up there too.  but THIS
Hardest man Alive 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This man is incredible, the doctor thing was so cringe, but how he can stay “sane” while doing what he did, is showing so much dedication and talent. He is incredible.. I never laughed harder at an episode of Hot Ones.
Best episode ever!!! ❤
I love Conan.
WOW!!! how do you top that episode!  Conan is a comedy beast!
Conan handled it like a pro😅😅😅
Season finale was explosive
👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️ Conan is and always has been a Comedic genius.
Iconic
EPIC! Conan: Genius! 😂
That's it... Guest of the year ... maybe ever...
the wings took Conan to a place where he got on Lewis Blacks level of frustration with life. honestly one of the best interviews in the shows history.
Conan you legend. Never seen this show ever came here only for conan. See you again when Conan is back.
Mike Reiss, former showrunner of the Simpsons (in the good years) always said Conan was the funniest person he'd ever met.
The absolute talk show host GOAT, all around comedy legend
Lol Conan's face is so flushed. It's like a carrot.
This episode is so great it nearly redeems having the Goop Crazy Lady over.  Conan is fantastic.
This just in: Madman O'Brien admitted to hospital with stomach perforation
Idk man. This puts Steve-O’s ep to shame.
Conan O'brien and David Blaine are the best interviewees.  Awesome!
He actually had color besides cadaver white in his face! 😂
This is the funniest episode of hot ones ever. Bravo
WE MISS CONAN ON TV JFC JUST BRING HIM BACK
One way to not only dull but end the pain is to become a vegan and not eat body parts of animals.  Pretty disgusting.  Eating chicken wings is self centered and unnecessary.  It's all about taste with no regard to sentient beings.  This is not entertainment in the least and looks bad for Conan (regardless of his skillset to conduct interviews and make people laugh).  Open up. Time to change and evolve.
Conan hot sauce god
I've never laughed so much in all of these episodes EVER!!!!!!!!!!   That last part rant was so funny..
Conan learned nothing or maybe everything from the Water Buffalo.
conan the GOAT. this will not be toppef
A defining moment in Pop Culture. Unhinged Conan. Absolutely amazing.
Conan is the real life Joker. He really killed it 🤣
Perfect example of an episode where i miss some of the og hotter sauses that have been replaced by more mild things they just call hot for interview sake death sause may not taste great but its absolutely hotter then last dab by a mile
This just went in my top 3 of hot Ones, cried laughing.
Conan is the man !!! love that guy
now we need jordan on here. would be a solid 4 hour video
So many bits running through this at the same time it’s amazing. Conan commits
We absolutely did not deserve this episode🥹. This was amazing.
This is the most chaotic Hot Ones I have ever experienced. I LOVED IT! Team CoCo!
this is cathartic to watch
One of the best episodes!
21:00
That is seriously about the funniest thing I've ever seen!  Conan is such a Legend!
Conan high key hoarding behavior 😂
i've always loved this man. incredible interview. i hope to meet both of you one day
Best episode, EVER! 🔥🔥☄️🧯
When Conan started splashing and drinking hot sauce blew my mind 🤣 All that Irish cooking sure made him tough 💪
This can never be and will never be topped.
Did he puke and they cut it out? Lol😂
Best episode yet!
IS THIS THE CRAZIEST HOT ONES EVER?
Complete redemption. From the Southpark movie to THIS. Bravo 👏
Without a doubt, not even close, Conan is a great. This is the greatest episode, ever. True comedy..
That’s how you close a season!!!! Awesome episode!!😂😅
Best guest ever hands down
What a legend
Only Conan would see the need to collect the partially eaten wings to protect the black market from his DNA….
Conan is the greatest showman!
First off, one of the best Hot Ones ever. Did I witness a pure comedic genius commit to his craft or the rantings of a depraved lunatic?  I'm guessing his "tears of a clown" moment was on the toilet the next day.
By far, the greatest.
I had to pause the video several times because it's too intense 😂😂😂
Only way to beat this is if you do Johnny carlsons ghost!
There is no better guest than Conan! Props for getting him to do this and congrats on the near 4M views in 2 days!! People still love him (me included).
This is a masterclass in comedy I’m stunned
The doctor bits were hilarious. Him saying "It's there" when Conan wanted him to check it made me laugh so hard
Top 10 episode
I’ve never laughed this hard at this show. Leave it to Conan to be funnier than the Gordon Ramsey episode.
Been watching this show for several years now. This is the best episode by a great margin. Good luck to the one trying to beat this.
Someone please tell me who the Doctor is??? More of him Please!!
When he took a 💩 it had to burn like a mother f'r! 😂  I salute you Conan 👏😅
Conan + hotwings = Lewis Black Who knew?
Conan really is God's gift.
By far the master of the death wings! CONAN!
Conan is king
What a beast!
Great episode. The last part with the last sauce reminded me of that great pivotal scene of Network!
This is top five all time!
the bar has been raised. wow.
SIR CONAN THE LORD OF SPICE🔥🔥🔥  Seriously easily one of, if not, the best Hot Ones EVER.
Un..hinged.
This surely beats the Gordon one.
I have never re-watched an episode of Hot Ones. I am doing so now. I may need Evans hooked up to a lie detector to see if they were in on it...replacing the hot bottle label on a bottle of mild, because this is either a phenomenal acting job or an unbelievable ruse. It is completely implausible that Conan wasn't in tears, vomiting, or both by the end. Maybe he was micro-dosing Scovils for a couple years?
Way way way way better than. Fallon.
Bring the wife
Conan is the best comedy host that has ever lived and no, this is absolutely not debatable
SOMEONE SAVE COCO!!!! STOP HIM!!!!!!
We gingers do have a higher pain tolerance.
Someone tell me where to get Conan’s jacket
What the heck did I just watch!?!  Conan is immortal.
I usually don’t like overly slapstick but Conan was so brilliant in the timing and the use of his jokes and there was a serious appreciation for the interview, for life and for the beauty of making ppl smile through comedy. I usually watch with a straight face even at the “funniest” but I was laughing so hard. And I’m a snob w comedy because I hate predictable bits. This was so satisfying in so many ways. I had read or heard that ppl who were his neighbors in real life that’s he’s 1 of the nicest guys (and super tall) and he def seems genuinely nice (and made Sean look like a shrimp). You could feel the authenticity of the real life principles he incorporates in his jokes. The gems he dropped were not wasted and I appreciate a well rounded person who’s not mean funny but kind, wise and still hilarious. Absolutely enjoyed this whole interview.
Greatest Of  All Time.
This season has been so fire.  I thought that Sterling K. Brown was the funniest interview until they had to top it off here with the comedy GOAT.  Hats off, Sean and team, y'all know how to DO it.
The best episode ever
Conan O'Brien has an amazing tolerance for pain. Not sure if he is a secret chilihead or not?
And that’s the last we heard of Conan 😂
Dr Arroyo really sets the stage for the pace of this one, "out of state" lol. Conan pocketing the bones. Chugging sauce. "I'm just starting to feel this one" with Da Bomb. Him trying to keep the energy up through the spice. I mean he was giving it everything he had. Dr. Arroyo in and out again. Conan is the GOAT. This is the best episode of Hot Ones I've seen.
Is Conan still alive after this? 😂
Best episode ever?
This might be the best hot ones episode ever! Conan is the 🐐
Fantastic episode. I've always loved Conan. I'm impressed that someone as young as Sean could pull out Edward R. Murrow that quickly.
this was potentially the most unhinged and impressive thing i have ever seen
Conan "the spice must flow" O'Brien
I don’t think you can invite Conan and then not follow up with Jordan Schlansky 🤔
Best episode ever.
What A BEAST!
"CALL THE WIFE!" 😂
Conan is a national treasure
After this I'm questioning if I'm even alive compared to Conan. Are we even on the same plane of existance? I think not.
That's not Conan O brien, that's just a sad, socially unaware old man.
Cried laughing. Awesome sauce.
Really funny and insightful interview!
Conan is really funny.
Honestly the hardest I’ve laughed with one of these.  Truly a comedy master class!
BEST episode EVER
Is the "other guy" Jay Leno?
"Take my pulse." "It's there."
I truly didn’t expect Conan to go so hard but I appreciated it
You can officially end the show here. No need for more seasons. This episode will not be topped. Legend.
Conan is king
Conan is the 🐐
Conan always makes me laugh and not just a chuckle but real laughter. Love you Conan
🐐
He ain’t no DJ Khalid! Love Conan!!!
We need Rick Flair on the show !! W000000000000000
Best interview ever on the show, in my opinion.
That was incredible. He's the best late night guy if all time and simply a comedian!
There is no one who can ever top this
Unpopular opinion, this is not why we watch hot ones. I'm here to watch celebs falter and panic. I want to see the human underneath. While his commitment to the bit was admirable, it's not what I was here for. It just felt obnoxious.
One of the funniest things I've ever seen. I'm in tears
Conan is one of the most naturally funny dudes on the planet in my opinion!🤣
This is and probably will ever be the greatest episode on hot ones.
Raw Unfiltered pure insanity diabolical Conan O'Brien 🤣
Conan is a champ, the BOMB kinda got to him essspiceyyy build up LOL
Best hot ones yet. Conan is still the man.
That was one of the funniest things I've seen in years. 😂
All timer.
AYE!!!!
Not right to use epic music for food.
Get Pat McAfee on the show!
Honestly how can anybody NOT like Conan
That was gross
Pure commitment.
You can’t top that
Clicked so fast when I saw Conan!!!!!!
All i can say is Shaun contributed to the death of Conan O'Brien. 🤣
Im just going to put this in the universe. Katt Williams? Anyone else intrigued by that?
Conan is one of the funniest people to ever live and my god did he manage to capture sauce comedy which I never thought would be a thing?  👏
Best episode ever
Babarian
Taylor Tomlinson next season, PLEASE
Conan was way crazier than usual. I think he felt it but his showmanship is too strong so he channeled the pain into going crazy
This could go up against any piece of content, whether fictional or non-fictional, of a master showcasing their dedication, wit, and pure talent to/in their respective craft. I'm in sheer awe watching this and it very well may be shown in film/comedy classes for decades to come.
Easily a Top 3 Episode All Time! Love that when Sean realized he was losing control... He Leaned In!
Bruh he’s savage 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I don’t believe I’ve laughed this hard during a hot ones interview. There’s been great funny moments but my goodness Conan is such a nut 😂❤
Legendary.
Hail to the chief O’Brien
Conan killed this episode! I have never seen anyone do that on this show. He is immune to hot sauce lol
The last dab turned into the last bottle 😅
Conan is a national treasure. Somehow he still feels criminally underrated
I wonder what he took before the show to numb the hotness
WOW, JUST WOW, Conan is the best guest and host ever, he brought it all to the show, what a showman, Gotta love him. I am also so glad he is going to drop his new travel series. hurrayyyyy!!!! Team CoCo all the way.
There is no one that makes my head hurt from laughing. Conan is the greatest ever! Thank you
hahahahaha oh my god. this was so great. thank you!!
Sean would be a great host for Late Night, don't you think so Connan?
Bravo!!!!
Conan really committed to the bit, no matter how much it destroyed him.  The only thing missing would have been if Sean called out like the water buffalo was there for a reunion just to see how Conan would have played off of it.
How was this insured
american comedy is..... interesting
I'm fine!  Lord have mercy, this man is an absolute blessing
Glorious. Simply glorious
Conan is GOATed
After this I’m an official Conan fan, I’ve never seen a white guy take that much sauce and keep a straight face
This is one for the ages.   Legend.
Sean trying to stay on point but Conan being pure chaos.
Conan you killed it 😂
Conan officially slots into my Top 5 favorite episodes. This was purely amazing!!
best episode you’ve ever done dare I say
This is like watching my students in a full moon
You can actually tell both are very good interviewers, but both also have a very distinct way of having conversations.
He gonna cry in the car
Finally a guest who did this show properly! lol
Finally!!!
What’s funnier than Don Quixote 😅😅😅
Hot ones can now retire. 😂
One of the greatest episodes
@18:30 Prime meme face
"He's not a good Doctor, He's an affordable one."  Health Care in America, in a nutshell. Conan, The Grand Master.😂😂
Conan tells a story about how he once risked his body on an impulsive desire to commit to a bit. And then proves he hasn’t changed at all. 😅
His monologues. Beautiful episode
Wing drop is official 😂❤
This is by far the best episode I’ve ever seen 😂
conan utterly mogged sean on da bomb good lord what an animal
Finally hot ones get a real legend 🥰
I was sweating watching it
And we have a winner!!!!🎉
This MAY be the best interview of all time
Conan is totally inspiring me in this interview. In my professional life I can relate with him so much as he goes back through the different chapters. Which is weird because I remember my opinion of his entertainment 15 years ago and seeing him now seeing what he has stuck with and been through truly inspires me! Go Conan!!
can u please please have matt berry on???
This is the funniest Hot Ones ever.
best episode ever.  gotta love Conan
By far!!! THEEEE BEST show ever!!!
Legend, HOF, never will be beaten in hot ones. Shows a wrap.
That is probably my favorite episode to date!
This was legendary. Im so proud of Hot Ones.
Conan come back......we need you
I cried, this was so funny.
Suggestion : Truth or Dab with  Conan, Andy and Jordan.
This was insanneeee! Amazing episode. GREAT BIT
Best Episode dam Conan is a G
This and Gordon Ramsay's may be my favorite
Can’t wait for the new show! Conan Visits was a brilliant YouTube series.
Conan sounded like Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force at the end there 😂
my god conan is unhinged
I actually love that he pointed out that you're dumber after watching the show since a lot of these travel shows with older people just seem like old people going on vacation rather than you learning anything about the country. At least he's being honest.
absolute mad lad
The only watchable late night host in decades!
You have had amazing shows before but this one with Conan is hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 A show that will sit at the top👍👍👍🇨🇦
Best episode
Wow. Conan is a pepper God
Dude is still the funniest mf alive period!! Bless you funny man!!
I’m in love with this man
Consider that some idiot decided to take Jay Leno over this beast. What a shame. Conon is effortlessly funny and he's as serious as a professional could be at the same time.
Best Episode ever - Conan is an Idol for all of us
Easily a Top Ten episode, Conan is a genius
This ones is in one of the best episode.. for sure!
Suomi mainittu!!!! Torilla tavataan!!
I don’t always watch this show, but this was gold
Best hot ones interview ever, will never be topped.
Unbelievable performance Conan
The best one to close the season, nuff said 🔥🔥🔥
Cringey
Conan is absolutely out of control hahahaha 😂 That was awesome
14:03  I nearly screamed when this man guzzled the sauce straight from the bottle. But, then I remembered the Buffalo story he'd told earlier. He really is about that life.
Been watching this show for years and I can honestly tell you this is the best episode of them all... kudos🎉🎉 y’all need to bring him back
Absolutely unhinged
i got sympathy flushes on the last one 😳
Charly Rose and Hot Wings🤣🤣🤣
Dr Arroyo was a comedy genius. This segment moved so fast with the pace of the humor. I wanted so much more, it was so good.
Hands down my favorite episode!!! Conan is king of the wings!
21:00 needed to ask Shemp or Curley.
Love you Conan!❤
I watched it twice…
YOU FREAKING BROUGHT HIM!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU!!!!
I literally screamed at the screen on the pepper X drink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Better than Ice Spice
Sooo. CoCo-aine, or..
Conan gets it
“😵‍💫 Sancho Panza… ya know? 😵‍💫” Hahahaha, I remember being a kid and staying up without my parents knowing so I could watch Late Night. This makes me so happy.
Greatest episode ever
All I can say is thank God for Doctor Arroyo
Love you Conan!
Well this was just the best one ever!
"wing drop!"   Absolutely the best way to punctuate the end of what will undoubtedly be regarded as the best episode ever.
That was hilarious🎉I think he was smart enough to prepare for the show and swallowed some absorbent 😅
This is one of the best piece of physical comedy I've ever seen. God, Conan is the greatest to ever do it.
Spice lord 😂
Nobody escapes Da Bomb.
This episode will never be topped.
Incredible Conan!
Conan- you're my hero! GOAT
Conan's the GOAT!
Wow!!!! Classic, Conan is the Hot Ones 🐐
I saw the screencap of him with milk slurring down his jaw before I watched this, and somehow that was the least gross moment of the hotter wings. Absolute masterclass
Bravo, that's show business!!!
Conan not only out winged the professional he wittingly found a way to completely get out of the “hot seat” and didn’t even have to answer all the questions which if I’m not mistaken is the point of the show 😂
We just totally skipped the question asked after the second to last sauce? 😂
Only two words for O'Brien: (A Crazy Braveheart) 😉👍🏻
Wowowowowow lo mejor Conan is the REAL GOT not Messi not cr7 he is La Cabra love it❤😂🎉
Next we need Jordan Schlansky
Best hot ones ever!! Never been a huge Conan fan but he is truly a great showman. P.S Am I the only one that wanted to reach in to the screen and clean his mouth????!!😂
Legend 😂
this is GOLD🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My god.... this is the single greatest episode of anything i think ive ever seen😂 conan has been one of my favorite comedians since i was young, i think he may have just become my favorite😂 sorry norm..
Best…..episode…..ever
EASILY Best Hot Ones Episode so far, THAT'S WHY CONAN IS THE GOAT!!!!!!
This is the best episode.
Can u get Nardwar on?
This might be the best episode ever. Steveo dumping hot sauce in his eye was great, but conan... wow.
Goat❤❤❤❤
Amazing! "This isn't a bit this is life!"
Conan O'Brien is the king of comedy! The best! Thank you Hot Ones for having him.
Best Guest EVER
This cannot be topped.
The best Hot Ones ever.
I’m dying 😂
This interview deserves an Emmy. I just rewatched it. The foreshadowing is insane - "this isn't going very well, is it?" Cue the journey that follows
Conan ruined it. Jumped the shark. Now everyone will think they need to go crazy. There will only be one more season. Maybe two. But it’s all going to be downhill from here. And not because he was funny; because he made a mockery of it.
Well I had favorite episodes of Hot Ones BUT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GOING TO INVITE CONAN! This is the best and funniest ep <3  Thank you for that!
Idk why when they talk with food in their mouth it looks weird
Best episode ever
Wait, did Sean lick the stethoscope?? 🤣🤣🤣
I love Conan so much! It was perfect
this is why this man is my father and im proud to say it
1 DAY AND 3 MILLION VIEWS??? FINALLY YALL IVE BEEN BRAGGIN ABOUT THIS GUY SINCE 2012
Ohh boy, this one tops everything
Him pocketing the wings is gold. Lol
Ganondorf: 26:18
Committed to the bit, right there. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 One of the best episodes, for sure.
Best episode ever
i love that he took it all the way!!! like he made it his with the inclusion of the dr too!
Best guest ever 🤣😂
This. Was. Awesome. He just maxed out the format at the end with bathing in it 🤣 This is my favorite episode! Conan simply rules with his unique style, timing, understanding and his view on comedy and making people feel good and laugh, and with the  pushing - but managing barriers cleverly, and all that from the start of his career. I also love when you made serious conversations. Big hugs from Hungary Conan, can't wait to see the new show, I loved the earlier remotes too!
The fact that Conan went all in is fantastic 🎉
Was not expecting Conan O'Brian's to be one of my favorite Hot Ones episodes, dude is a mad man.
I went to med school with Dr. Arroyo
Conan pocketing those wings is maybe the best thing I've seen on this show
Conan is just a legend!!
I feel bad when nobody eats the wings fully.. love Conan
COCO is THE Goat.
I've never felt so DEEPLY uncomfortable watching a Hot Ones episode. Pure genius....
Like before watching it!!I love Conan!!!!!
I forgot how much I enjoyed watching Conan.
This was the only episode where I found myself screaming "NOOOOOOO!" And "DON'T DO IT!!" like the Bills had finally made it back to the Superbowl.
💎
23:00 new meme
“Is it HBO Max or just Max? I can’t get used to it. It’s not a better name. Anyway, uh Max, um, said…Max…that really rolls off the tongue, doesn’t it?”
From someone who regularly eats that last dab sauce the “eXperience” one. I can tell you that sauce is no joke😂 Man absolutely bodied that sauce for our entertainment
He is so smart. Love him
Brett Baker, this better be ranking HIGH on your list.  This is by far one of the greatest episodes of Hot Ones. Period.
best episode ever!
Conan is a legend, by far the best guest Sean has ever had on Hot Ones, no one can ever come close to Conan, had me laughing from start to finish.
Unhinged Conan is my spirit animal 🔥
Wow this was the best guest ever!!!
GOAT
G.O.A.T Best interview ever..
Sean's genuine look of concern just before the final monologue is so visceral.
Love watching Conan do anything. So much of his delivery reminds me of the best vintage Simpsons lines!
BRO WAKE UP THE BEST HOT ONES EPISODE DROPPED YESTERDAY
he’s so great man
Hysterical 😂
That was legendary
Witnessing a master at work
"CALL THE WIFE!" , this sent me over the edge man hats off to Conan
If Conan doesn't get an Oskar for this, there is something wrong with this world.
Umm..that might be the #1 Ranked of all time right there.
Craziest hot ones episode ever.🤯
This show Is trash
I liked this video at 00:01
I just love the worrying look on Sean when Conan goes all in on the last dab
Can't wait for all the memes from this one
I kept thinking he was talking about Max Weinberg 😅
People who haven't seen Conan since he was on television: 😳
anybody else pause and go look for this water Buffalo situation?  😅
Love it
if i could give more likes i totally would
we need philomena cunk ❤
Best Hot Ones yet🔥🔥🔥🔥
Made me tear of joy . Thank you Conan
This is pure chaos haha what a way to end the season
People are really buying into this one..Meh..Conan is annoying,obnoxious and leaning strongly towards bad weird..Michael Cera was quite charming,however.
This was really gross
At one point Chris Farley took over Conans body.
Love to see Conan’s another level of insanity! 😂
Standing ovation
I hope his house has copper pipes.
You can see Conan has Irish roots because at the end he kinda reminds me of Father Jack Hackett
Amazing!😂✨
When are we getting Michael Rosenbaum and Tom Welling??!
"...and of course I never listen to Andy..." 🤣🤣🤣❤
MISTAKE!!!
This is, by far, the FUNNIEST hot ones episode I have ever watched 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Conan took it like a LEGEND!!!
I think this is the first time ive seen a guest completely control the show.
I keep staring at Conan's shoes. I can't unsee them after hearing Bill Burr ask him "why do your wingtips have athletic soles?"
My boy Conan goin senile 🤣
INCREDIBLE!!!!!
THE GOAT
I usually don't rewatch these but this one KILLED so I'm here again
This is by far the best one I've ever seen
Conan for president?
6:33.      23:30
Instant classic
24:02 "there's funny everywhere. Dont be a snob!"
24:56 conan drinking all that milk to immediately spit it out has me peeing my pants lol
I need a meme of "I'm fine! I'm perfectly f*ing fine!" Thanks
Conan's right tho. Sean is an amazing interviewer that I personally learned a lot from as a journalist.
23:49 is a great shot
Straight up the G.O.A.T.
Somebahdy make 21:00 a whole gif please lol
ConeBone69 #1!
BEST EPISODE EVER 🐐
Sweet Jesus! Conan just ruined the show! Where is there to go from here? At the top there's only down. 😭
23:50
Wow.. insane and lived up to the hype. Just waiting for the news article about his rush to the hospital
God I love Conan. Instant cure for a bad day, always.
Conan is an icon .. cannot belive how long ive been watching him.
best episode ever
What a legend! He either has no pain receptors in his mouth or he is just a badass. The complete opposite of DJ Khaled. Love the chaos energy. A perfect close for the season.
Conan after the last wing bears a striking resemblance to Rick promoting the next season when he’s slightly manic. Even the drool. Legend.
That’s how you end a season 😂😂😂 i can’t wait until it’s my turn fr
The HBO max money must be so good that Conan went back to the Tonight Show and then this. If it is not good it better be good, conan deserves ALLLLLLL of it
The best.
Ok ... this is pure Conan magic mixed with Hot Ones. Sean how had to try and corral him and ultimately just let him go for it :D
Conan will always be the best! The way he commits 100% to everything he does. Love him
Fallon ! They need to do jimmy fallon
“A Charlie Rose show where you eat hot wings”. Perfect and most respectful description of Hot Ones! Conan is an absolute legend!
This is the best hot ones yet.
This is one of the best things I've watched in my life
can you please get Jake T Austin on season 24? that'd be awesome
Man U don’t make ‘‘em like him anymore..gonna watch the show now for sure!
Jesus...this is like the game of thrones finale we never had but always wanted.
"These are not the rantings of someone who's had some bad chemicals"
best episode so far
His face aged 10 years in 10 minutes lol
Funniest laugh out loud episode to date....thank you Conan!
gold
I have never been more terrified in my life. Dude DRANK hot sauce, and not weak hot sauce.
Please please please get Will Arnett!!
This is why i love Conan😂😂😂
"Team Coco"
Obliterated it. I'm in awe.
"I like to announce my mistakes up front." - Conan. Absolutely hilarious.
Baldur during the whole GoW (2018): 22:31
Still social distancing come on
Wonder how he is feeling now ?
Conan is one of my favorite of all time. Been watching him since i was a kid
Instant classic. All time great episode
I cannot believe Conan let out a "doriyaaaaaahhhhh" - he play smash?
holy cow
Well we obviously have a new winner of hot wings! Amazing God bless big G 🫡 Too real 👌Wing drop… 🙀
Ппц...😁
Conan finished it like Tony Montana at the end of Scarface.
Conan is a savage. Best finale to a season yet
Awesomeness
I love Conan!!! He is the best. Such a gross episode haha
I hope Conan live forever. He just makes life much better.
19:13
23:01 Shawn’s laugh
This was harder to watch than ice spice. He tries way too hard to be funny
Sean, you always say you do what the guest do. What happened dude?
EPIC
Best episode ever.
This is the most BOSS episode! Conans ears must still be ringing 😂 Coco is the man!
I love Conan ❤❤❤
I'll now watch Conans show...thanks for suffering mate. Also Conan makes Dj Kahled look like a pathetic coward.
Conan looks old now
I can’t imagine how any of the guests for the next seasons could possibly top this off. They have very big shoes (and a very messy table) to fill.
This episode will NEVER be topped.
This is the most inspiring piece of media I have ever consumed. I now have the will and motivation to get out of bed.
It was tough to watch the second half. Knowing all too well what he will experience in the bathroom later.
Man had to be the season finale because there aint noone following that
This has to be the best episode of hot ones ever. What a fudging legend.
The best! Unbelievable 😆🤣😆🤣
The best episode ever
"Grew up on tasteless food"  Chugs bottles of hot sauce like a maniac.
Best one so far!!!!!
Totally unexpected Totally APPRECIATED
I'm a hot foods/sauce connoisseur and I have to say that Conan O Brien is AMAZING! He lasted the whole hot wings set. I'm so IMPRESSED!
True story: Conan is immune to gun fire. He started by shooting himself everyday for a month with a Daisy air rifle, and then from there worked his way up through the .25, .22lr, on up through to 9mm, he took a brief hiatus to heal from the Conan/ Leno fiasco. Jumped right into .40 to .45 and just kept on climbing. If you ever get the chance, get him to show you his 40 mike mike trick; hilarious.
This episode was FIRE ! Thanks for everything Conan and Sean \m/
This and Dave Grohl’s episode is where the guest truly steals the show from Sean and made it their own thing.
This made me very uncomfortable. Conan is king. I can’t believe this. Amazing.
That monologue at the end is so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He’s the guy who’s had your girl and ruined her for any fable attempt that follows. Always been my favourite anywhere he goes.
“CALL THE WIFE!!!!!!”
This is by far my favorite episode now! This show is always great and Conan was right, you're an awesome interviewer.  Finally getting Conan on had to be a dream for you as much as it was for us. He's got such a huge personality. I love so much that he took the time to appreciate you, also! That's one of the reasons I love him so much. That ending was so explosive, too LOOOOL
Conan O'Brien: 99% Irish  1% jalapeno
Everything Conan is involved with is complete gold. Dudes a treasure 100%. His face has never and will never have that much color again.
Conan once comedically said he is 100% Irish, i think that inbreeding probably caused some genetic mutation where he lost the spice detecting receptors on his tongue.
I don't know what the big deal with this episode is, it's really funny.  It's actually kind of gross, when he keeps opening his mouth with food in it, and it would be nice just once for him to be normal and not over the top.  That is not comedy.
Im gonna walk away from this video with quotes for my day to day.
1 word "Epic"!!!!
Conan peaked this show. It can only go down hill from here. How do you follow that?
i hope conan is okay.
Best episode of hot ones hands down
Conan is the best
I love Coco
Bro hijacked this show so hard 😂
My cat Max was very confused 😂
He took it like a champ and he’s never had spicy in his life. Mad respect!
I freaking love Conan I’ve never been as excited for an episode this man is an artist and a master of his craft loves watching him on here
Conan has always been genuinely hilarious
Good god I didn't know Conan could eat this spicy @@
funniest hot ones ever
When he drank the hot sauce directly from the bottle my wife audibly gasped!  What commitment.
This is amazing. <3 Conan.
What a legend Conan is.
Conan can’t be topped. Best late night host ever
Call the Wife!!!
I did not know that Conan possessed David Blaine levels of physical resiliency. One of the greatest episodes to date.
Best episode hands down - Conan is the funniest man in USA since the 90s
i don't think ive ever laughed as hard watching Hot Ones... Conan is the GOAT in my opinion and took this spicy chickenwing premise to a whole new level. i've never seen any guest do it the way he just did it. He's the Michael Jordan of Hot Ones.
The best episode of Hot Wings for sure. Crazy performance by Conan.
This was CRAZY I loved every moment man. All of his responses and the disrespect on all the wings was hilarious 😭
Sean finally met his matcjh. The ultimate professional. Conan is AMAZING
This is a proof of how amazing Conan is! The lack of b-roll on Sean side shows he couldn’t catch up on Conan’s sauce pouring madness. Halle Berry’s was an awesome show but I don’t think anything can top Conan’s performance now. He set the bar too high.
Conan ma man 💙
Fu😂
He's a Madlad for sure. He used all the energy he stashed since the last Late Night Show in one go and he WILL be memorable.
More comedians. Please.
THAT'S how you promote a show!  I'm sold
I have been watching this man since 1996! This further validates how good the initial decision was.
Conan won Hot Ones. Wing Drop. GOAT
Conan is KING
this was easily the funniest episode I’m crying
The best episode ever!
Best episode ever! Hilarious 😂
I fkn love this dude 🤣🤣
Conan the Barbarian ❤
THAT'S HOW YOU CLOSE A SEASON!! 🔥 🔥
I'll never be able to go back to people nibbling the wing and fanning their face after this.
Wing drop😂👏👏
I actually lost it when Conan drank hot sauce off the bottle. What a maniac! 😂
Best episode ever…. Get that man on every channel
Conan knows Bailey the cameraman, his work history and where he's been. Still remembers decades later. James Corden couldn't name a crew member working on the very episode they were filming... Because Conan is perhaps best gift humanity has ever received.
That is easily top 5 best interview on this show. Perhaps the number 1. So good. Couldn’t stop laughing.
This is the best show by far, congratulations on the complements from Conan
WHAT A BEAST <3 I can't comprehend the level of genius Conan is. Absolute legend.
Casually rubs hot sauce on his chest.
Conan is a showman.  We're blessed to have him while we're alive.  True greatness.
Conan just made his show, feel like watching on Conan O'Brien Youtube channel 🤣🤣❤️
Charlie Rose comment spicy af. Absolute king episode
Loved this. Conan rocks!!
I’m sorry that Conan brought that “Dr” bit because it was so unnecessary. Just talking to Sean about interviewing would’ve been great. I like both of them.
Best episode ever, Conan is the greatest.
The best episode in Hot Ones ever! Conan is such a perfect showman with the best doctor! 🤣He's carrying the show to the NEXT LEVEL! "My intestines have turned into acid" Oh yeahhh!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is like watching Conan going super sayan and becoming more Conan. Simply amazing this man is an icon.
The way Conan's face got progressively redder throughout the interview had me dying. Best interview.
This is the best episode ever oh my god 🫨😂
Conan rides the metaphorical water buffalo once again.
Conan is the goat! Best episode. Thank you Conan for going through physical pain, to lighten our mental pain.
The king of Hot Ones.
Oh God, cut the Avengers like music. Just let me hear them talk. 😅
Conan just isn't funny. How embarrassing.
Greatest of all time
what a very wild episode!!!
Wing drop
Based and goated
My favorite comedian ever😂😂😂
GOAT EPISODE
What a legend!
conan will always be #1
looking for hunter schafer, anya taylor joy and zendaya as guest ;)
@8:05 what is that
Conan giving a passionate speech with sauce splattered on and drool coming down his face, there is no other.
24:23 bro turned into Rick Sanchez
God this dude is annoying. Worse episodes I’ve seen.
6:56 I absolutely love how Conan will never miss a chance to give positive feedback. This is such a underrated trait that I think more people should take after
This has to be my favorite episode
Epic 👏🏻
I think we all screamed, “Nooooooo!” when he poured Da Bomb all over that wing. But I’m so happy he did. 💀💀💀
Conan going nuts with those hot sauces at the end..hand on my face saying oh no, oh no, OH NO
First n last time you'll every see someone drink the hottest sauce
Conan. 🐐.
Guys a phycopath 😂😂😂😂
Best episode ever😂😂
Absolute legend
that guy is funny af
How am I just learning that my birthday is exactly a week after Conan’s, I’m 25th.
Nothing can top this, just end the show after this 😤
BEST. EPISODE. EVER!
The best episode ever
I need Conan’s wife’s reaction to this
Sean's tears have got to be burning 😂
Clowning yourself for the Gen Z, Humiliate yourself for the 19 year old woke crowd, Debase yourself for the younger audience.
Pocket wings. Nice. 👌🏼
16:45 "Oh my God... ooh my gosh!....OH MY GOSH!!!"  Sean increasingly freaking out as Conan pours Da bomb on his wing then proceeds to lick it clean! LOL! Conan is 100% THEE SPICE LORD!
LAST DAB < LAST DOUSE 💀💀
Gandhi+ Popeye= Conan.  Perfection.
Epic
Shortly after this episode was filmed Conan passed away from the worst case of ring sting western doctors have ever seen
Conan 🐐
Best interview ever
Jesus Christ!
Best episode ever!
Anyone, What's going on? Can someone explain to me? 😂
Simply brilliant, Conan was amazing, I laughed hard so many times 😂
PLEASE INVITE JASON KELCE !!.  I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM BALLING HIS EYES TO THESE WINGS 😂😂
Conan putting the bones in his pocket is sending me 😂😂
“Dr. Arroyo, he’s not the best but… he’s very affordable”
Best TV Host met Best Youtube Host
Conan is so dammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm funny. Love him always..... Steph in Alaska
Incredible episode. Conan making the crew burst into laughter multiple times was great. What a beast.
Did he really just drink that sauce?
Proof that Conan is actually a bird.
Where is Jordan Schlansky ?!
Can anyone tell me whats that denim jacket Conan was wearing?
God I'd love a microphone in Conans toilet after this.... xD
Hi I'm Latvian girl and I love American men ❤❤❤
This makes me so happy 😊
Hard to pick the funniest bit in this, Conan is a genius.
Love conan
Legend😂
Hot ones G.O.A.T 🔥
Two things stuck out to me: 1.) Conan, giving credit where credit usually due: Sean is an amazing interviewer.  You better be applying for any open late night positions. And 2.) Conan is a freaking mad man. Second best episode evert.
''This one, I'm not going to lie, I'm feeling it a little bit...'' - Conan is a straight SAVAGE!
unhinged, I love it!
Conan is a god among men
I have to watch, April 18th.😂😂😂😂😂😂
24:55 Apparently when Conan is in excruciating pain, he turns into Lewis Black
Stuck in the restroom Finishing this vid.🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
A masterclass
What did I just watch - breakdown or genius...???
Godamm Conan is a pepper monster!
Nobody: Conan: I'm fine!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😂
Best ever. No contest. 😂😂😂😂😜
Conan pulled off 3 running jokes (wings in pocket, wings aren't hot,  dr arroyo) in a 25 min show where he isn't even the host. His wit and understanding of comedic pacing is absolutely incredible.
6:25 “the other guy” 😂
He’s one of my favorite people ever
Hands down the best episode of Hot Ones. Conan absolutely took over from the start, a true comedy legend.
Me watching YouTube in 2024: 0:00
This was the best FWF episode ever.
My new favorite episode.
It's like a Lewis Black impression at the end. 😂
This guy is true professional 💪
Probably the best hot ones episode yet.
"I bet you live four more years tops" is going to be my new go to during an awkward conversation!
Van Gogh sacrificed an ear for love. Conan sacrificed his toungue for a lark! 😂 🔥 🥵
An Absolute Legend!! CONAN O'BRIEN
#1 episode. The second I heard Conan would be on, I just knew he would bring it!
This is the best episode in the history of any internet episode
Best Hot Ones episode of all time.
😂😂😂 best episode yet!
This. Is. The. Best. Ever lol
incredible
I wish Taylor swift would come
Conan is the man.
This is a finale episode level, love Conan
Through that was Agassi
You're not a doctor are you.  I should be
Would that we could all have quality health care providers like Dr. Arroyo. Just look at that attention to detail.
I have never, NEVER laughed so hard in my life. This was comedy Gold. I love Conan.
Jean jacket for the coolness
who let conan do this? dr. arroyo? look at conan's skin. he's going to be burned just from touching a sauce  bottle.  (hello to andres'  brother!)
Lots of thanks to Conan O'Brien for entertaining us watching!
He is brilliant and I hope he recovered quickly from the episode.
HOWW?!?! Wow Conan the Barbarian!
Geez, surprised Conan didn't pour it in his eyes.  I'm 46 and have watched Conan since I was in high school. Love him!
Of course Conan still makes me laugh to tears
Conan is my GOAT
Dude is a psycopath lol
If you just watched the first wing and cut all the way to last wing, it would be just as hilarious.  Drooling, spitting, delirious fool at the end.
I dont know why but Sean's interview style seems so detached and emotionless to me. Sometimes it just irks me but, on the other hand, it does highlight the personality of the interviewee. Watching these episodes is a love/hate experience 😂
I love Conan
Conans is the Goat of Hot ones and Late Night Talk Shows!!!
I love how the interview mirrors the level of spice. It starts out pretty casual like the first wing then completely unhinged by the last wing!
Has to be the most insane battle against the wings of death. what a duel to behold and witness. Goated episode.
There’s been a lot of hype about this: it’s absolutely surpassed all of that hype
What a show by Conan! 🙌
RESPECT! NOTHING FOLLOWS.
Absolutely the best Hot Wings guest ever. What a hero. All for comedy gold.
I haven’t laughed this hard in years, Conan really stole the show here 😂😂
Fucl<ing Comedy God!!!
Almost 4m views in 24 hours Conan's the man still
BRUH
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is so unhinged im crying 😅
I love Conan !!!
Conan always says he can't act, but acting like he's not dying inside while chugging hot sauce is extreme acting!
beast mode
This is the first time I have ever seen color on Conan's face.
Conan with Da Bomb was truly inspirational
Conan as God made him
One of the best episodes along with Colin Farrell and Stone Cold Steve Austin.  People who would of been great on Hot Ones but we'll never get to see...  JOHN CANDY STEVE IRWIN JOHN BELUSHI KOBE
Quite tame for Conan. Was expecting his eyes to pop out of his sockets or something tbh
Conan is the best!
This was the most suspenseful episode I've watched
Great 👍 🔥
Protect his eyes!
My favorite late night tidbit i know is that studio crews at 30 rock stay at the studio even though shows change. Imagine working those epic shows as your career!
"Dr. Arroyo, he's not the best, but he's very affordable."
Heroes get remembered. Legends never die.
What an animal! Omfg! Legend!
Dear God that was hilarious. Tears...😭
Legend
Conan sent it
Possibly my favorite episode. Well done Conan
Hands down one of the BEST Hot Ones I’ve EVER witnessed, while also being incredibly inspirational! Salute!
saw the nearly 30 minutes n was off put slightly, but then got locked in for each minute, duration was important
Talk about comedy gold! I've never laughed so hard at a comedy show in my life! Legend!
i think this is your most bestest episode
Best First We Feast ever!! My wife and I were in tears laughing!!
He's Legendary ❤
I want to meet the giant that is Conan Obrien! Andy is a friend of where I have an alliance.
I almost died when the doctor put his hands around Conan’s throat to “check his pulse”. 😂
Conan Epic as always 😂
my man conan
This is the best Hot Ones I’ve ever seen. So funny.
Best episode, could really feel the fun you guys were having and obviously it was incredibly funny!
Bro enabled Goblin Mode
16:38...Just Draw Straws
Conan is the BEST!! He ruled this challenge!
Another absolutely brilliant Conan piece. Great interview too. I’m going to watch this daily to keep my spirits up.
Re watched it right away. I downloaded it too so I can watch it again soon. Conan is the best, and I'm glad he's finally on this show.
True Lisan al Gaib
Anyone who comes after Conan is going to look like DJ Khaled. Time to go out on a high note!
I love Conan and I'm gonna watch his show but can we all agree that this is a ripoff of An Idiot Abroad
Never thought Conan can even take pure the pepper X like that without being blush. Wish him a very good streaming rate. Lookin for the multi-season show.
That last shot of Conan just standing completely unhinged shirt open at the end was what got me.
This brought me so much joy lol
Did Sean also dab the sauce extra for this episode?? I felt I've never seen him frown like this twice in the show after having a bite lollll
I put this video on my self improvement playlist!!!
You can tell Conan went to Harvard
This is gotta be the best episode ever👏😂
Conan looks tall AF
The best before and after... 2:09 - before 23:00 - after
This is the funniest hot ones i’ve ever sent, Conan is absolutely hilarious.
Conan's dedication to any bit is just impressive 🤣
At 17:30 note Conan has switched to MILK...
THE best before and after on this show... Before: 3:38 After: 24:27
Went from the worst episode ever with Ice Spice, to the best episode ever with Conan.
Awesomeness!!  👊😊✊😁😂👍♈🍁♈
just watching liquid plutonium spilling all over the table haha Conan is a beast
Sean, this just proves why you are such a great host. You give each of your guests exactly the space they need.
My favorite talk show host. He’s incredibly funny & would love to meet him one day.
conan, harvard professor of entertainment
Doctor, is Conan okay after this interview? 😂
I have watched just about every one of these things, and this might be the very best episode ever. Conan nails it
BEST GUEST EVER
26:19 this needs to be at the end of every episode from now on
Conan needs Chili Klaus! 😅
Ah man, Conan is and will always be a legend of Comedy and the most extreme conquerors of the hot ones. Drinking it as well, no one has ever done that and no one ever will.
now that is commiting to the bit
Not going to lie, no episode has ever actually made me interested in pursuing the guest more, but this shook the foundation of everything I thought I knew about Conan and now I am VERY invested in this upcoming show
What is up with the soundtrack? Guys, you are not diffusing a bomb over here. chill...
Ok nvm he topped the Gordon Ramsay hot one
Wow 😱
EPIC HILARITY, and one of the very best season finales!! --Spoiler alert... Da Bomb flowing onto the table! Conan brought his signature madness and spontaneity!
This is it. The greatest episode of Hot Ones. Conan is the GOAT.
Best one ever, Conan is the GOAT with comedy and now wings
Wow conan really made this the 2nd best hot one right next to Gordon Ramsay
Legit thought he was gonna do a line of the pepper x sauce there for a sec
Best episode ever,and that’s saying a lot.The ultimate profession
Interview William Osman!
Conan is the hardest guy in any room
This was amazing 🤣🤣🤣
I have nothing to say but 🫡 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Conan saved this season !
He always delivers the best he can. Absolute professional entertainer, no holds barred.
I mean don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan. But honestly it's too late and you're too old to make ridiculous stunts just for a "2nd chance", Conan. And bro, its just fcn HBO Max. At that age, you should just accept the things are what they are and fcn move on with your life. Trading the next, and probably last 20 years of your life for this things is just not unwise. Just leave it to the new guys, your style of comedy is getting too old, and so are your remaining viewers.
Holy Chupacabra, he drank the last dab and was able to speak coherent words
Vibrating, screaming, drooling Conan is the true unshackled Conan. We are blessed to finally see him in his untethered form. Now he is unleashed upon the world, signaling the breaking of the seventh seal. Praise him.
Conan is a legend and this cements it.
Gordon Ramsay, Gino d ocampo plus conan o brian 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sean Evans is NOT a good interviewer, he's an absolute sicophant and the questions are researched and written by someone else!
The fact that "Read high and read low..." sounds both like a bit and the best advice you've ever heard.
Easily the best episode yet
That is absolute crazy Conan didn't just shrug off the wings he incorporated them into his comedy.
This is exactly how this show should be done
Legend!
This was a really enjoyable hot ones, especially towards the end
Thats why he is the best one.
This has to be the best Hot One's episode ever!! Somone put Conan on the Hall Of Fame!
Best show ever😂😂😂. I hope is all right😂😂
Painkillers work wonders 😅
That's our CONAN!!
Day = Made
Great show !!
That was fairly impressive - disrespecting Da Bomb - nuts.
Conan's hair is so distracting. I feel like most of his guests felt the same way and also had to be on queue with his jokes. Such a master of comedy.
Incredible
This man is the definition of entertainment. I always LOVED him
That doctor needs his own doctor
Conan the Entertainer, you see thumbnail with Conan you know you ll be entertained!!
This season had Ice Spice and Conan. What a ride.
Legendary! Conan's the definition of.a riot. This episode had me belling laughing.
Conan  Not a human
seriously q, are the wings room temp? warm? I imagine it adds another layer to it when they're room temp 🤢
Conan is simply the best.
Well, that's it, folks. It won't get better than that. Wrap it up. We did it!
Get Craig Ferguson!!!
“He’s been my doctor for 25 years. Where did you go to medical school?” “In 1998” Not off to a good start.
135,600 scoville units Da'Bomb is a blend of Habanero and Smokey Chipotle Peppers as well as natural pepper extract to create a sauce that measures at 135,600 scoville units. It is extremely hot, *consume one drop at a time* with caution.  "When all else fails there's always delusion." - Conan O'Brien
Amazing 😂😂😂😂
Hahaha great entertainment value💯💯
Actually insane
COB = Chronic O'Burn
Conan Never fails to deliver.
Casually puts chicken wing in his pocket 😂 Classic Conan
This is hands down the best Hot Ones episode you've ever made. Bravo. Conan is a legend.
"I dont fear your wings, man"
I would love to see a “24 hours after Hot Ones” segment were we follow Conan for the next 24 hours to see how he is doing 😅
Funniest Hot Ones I've seen since Key & Peele were on the show 😂
Can I be on Hot Ones just a normal guy funny maybe interesting definitely 😂😁
og 🐐
If we could get the unedited version of this, that would be... Truly something.
I am youtuber plz subscribe my channel❤ Free fire live stream  And diamond custom
30 years ago people were saying this guy doesn’t belong in front of a camera.  What a career arc.  Has become truly one of the legends of comedy.  People will be calling him a godfather soon enough.
Was Conan the voice behind Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force? Swear he starts to sound like him after the last dab! Great episode!
I think I can unsubscribe now. Nothing will top this
Absolute legend
The greatest episode ever!
"Call the wife!" 😂
This is the best!
Conan is now the Hot One’s GOAT
Can we please get an alternate version of this video which is just Sean's reactions? This was freakin' insane and I'd love to see his real time reactions to all of Conan's shenangians 😂
Conan is a mad man
I hope you have some more post show footage for future! looking forward to it 🤣 Conan has the biggest cohonas ever🤣
Best guest ever!! Comedic genius! All hail King Coco!
Best episode of all time. Masterpiece
this is the greatest hot ones episode of all time!
Well his bathroom visit later will totally Make up for the lost pain 💩
Conan is an absolute legend!
THAAAANK YOU CONAN!!! What a masterpiece! I always wanted to see someone unhinged coating and drinking those hot sauces! This man is a beast!! 😂😂😂😂
Lovit! You guys made my day :)
they gonna need a better lineup next season. conan made it look like he's only acting they're hot
This is the best one. I was screaming at the screen when he was doing Da Bomb. "NOO, CONAN! NOOOO! "
By far!!! probably the best episode
The second I clicked on this, i knew Conan would not disappoint. He commits, he puts on a show, he gives the people what they want. The best 👏
Mighty Boosh The Tundra song It's the nothingness...  The whiteness...  The endless-ness...  Stretching on beyond the human imagination,  Desolation of the soul,  Oh my God!  Ice flow, nowhere to go,  Ice flow, nowhere to go,  Lost in the blinding whiteness of the tundra...  Check him out.  They call him the shrew,  Arm's in short, in with the claw-  I'm little Johnny Frostbite,  Moving around,  Freezing you up, freezing you down,  Like an icicle,  Comin' in your tent in the pink light scissorbite,  Arctic death, Infinite night,  They call me Tundra Boy  Because I move like an Arctic Lizard,  When the blizzard strikes I disappear like a pipe dream,  All that's left is a gleam on a tent peg  Boosh, boosh, stronger than a moose,  Don't lock your door or we'll come through your roof top,  Stop look around, take your mind off the floor  Because the Boosh is loose and we're a little bit raw,  Ice flow, nowhere to go,  Ice flow, nowhere to go,  Lost in the blinding whiteness of the tundra...
I'm rolling! Best episode ever!
Conan was channeling some Vazzini from the princess bridge it felt like. xD
I haven’t laughed in awhile like this… Conan was great
Legend and a classic
looking forward to the snacked you also filmed while he was in studio
This is the best episode of all time
I see Conan, i like. Now i watch the video
This is the trailer for Joker 2.
conan can go completely off the rails and we still know he’s just a sane comedic genius.
"What's the point of even being alive if we can't do it"
Conan with full Howard Beale
Why he putting chicken in his pocket hahahaha
I love Conan. I now love him even more
This was hilarious.
This has to be the greatest Hot Ones episode ever! Omfg I am dying!
this was the best 🤣, love Conan!
Ha what’s happening with his hair hahahaha
Genius. Now, this is how you advertise Max to people who dont even know HBO had changed names.
Conan was gonna go test those wings afterwards to see if there was any poison you might be a covert operative/comedian/night show host////
That's Conan, the barbarian
Bro will sit a daylong on a toilet🚽 just because he wants to me make us laugh/entertain 💀
Conan is on a different level
I love to think of the people who were just introduced to Conan bc of this 😂. What a legend
He looks like a burns victim.
Hot ones has a new boss.
No one believed me, Always said...Conan is a god among comedians!
Conan's commitment to the wings and not faltering once, seemingly ramping up as the sauce got hotter, isn't just admirable, but a testament to professional comedy.
This is the one or THE Best episode of Hot Ones! Love Conan!
Legit the g.o.a.t. o7
his vein coming out his right eye....golden!
I wish I could like this twice
😂call the wife!!!😂
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is THE BEST one yet. CONAN is the best.
Conan is just absolute class
"I'm fine, I'm perfectly f'ing fine!" 😅
25:18 👀🤯🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 That's Right !!!
Conan is my all-time favorite talk show host! (Sorry Sean, you're without a doubt great and definitely in a league of your own!) He's hilarious and the way he took the wings of death down without (almost) any problem was amazing!
😊
Conan + Da Bomb = Lewis Black + Robin WIlliams. Send the man a lifetime supply.
This is why I love Conan. He is madness personified. Best Hot Ones ever.
A masterclass in comedy.
Oh my god, the later sauces are hysterical! Conan you a legend! 🤣🤙🏻🙇🏻‍♂️
The real reason conan kept the wings is he doesn't want his dna getting out there
Easily the best "Let The People Know What You Have Going On In Your Life" moment so far.  Conan was buzzing off the sauce for sure.  Kudos to committing to the concept and delivering such a performance.
always loved Conan, but now might be IN love with Conan?
Wait, no question on sauce #9?
Why did he do a street fighter “HOAAAAYA” at the end
Conan is a legend😂
the gasps I gusped… my hands was reaching for my pearls to clutch them  …the last two wings… oh my lord… Conan is a legend
weird old man yikes
14:10 - This scene made me think you should get Trump on the show. And that lead to basically any living (former) president. Vice presidents have a lot of potential as well. (Can't predict the future) And then 17:55, They talk about getting a president on Conan's show. Imagine getting George Washington on Conan! He got wild.
got to be one of the best interviews if no the best
This is brilliant! I can’t stop laughing ❤
Lot of fake laughs from Shawn but I do love Conan can’t stand the rest of the so called talk show hosts
"You're not a Doctor are you?"  "I should be..."  😅😅😅😅
I can’t help but wonder what this episode would’ve been like with norm by Conan’s side.
Brilliant
I couldn't help but rewatch this episode right after it finished... That's never happened before lol
I need the B roll footage 😂 he was amazing I can only imagine after the camera stopped rolling
GREAT episode 😂
I am kind of impressed the white boys killing it Nsync also showed no huge reaction . whites can take the spice
*slow clap*
How on earth did he do that?!?!
This was so unhinged 🤣 best episode
God I miss watching Conan. I wasn't ready to cry laughing.
Conan the Red!!!🌶
one and only Conan O'Brien
This contest is over. Give that man the $10,000!
Well he took it to a place I didn't expect 😅
Best episode eva!!
I just want an ep of the b-roll on this one
Not a single gong can be heard.
Wow Conan is hilarious. He and Charlize Theron are the best
CONAN MADMAN SHOWMAN IRISHMAN 👍👍👍
As soon as he picked up da bomb I can literally hear the collective gas p of the internet lol we all knew.
Best Hot Ones EVER!
best episode ever
Conan's spice tolerance is about as high as his chances of getting a good night's sleep after this
Best episode ever 😂❤
Now that this episode has been out for a day and the views are serving complexes interests we need to discuss the fact that Conan’s desperation in the episode is dumbfounding. The transition from inteligible knowing of a character that someone plays to gain the approval of millions to the small studio set up that reaches millions through a niche YouTube orientated set up and how the two bifurcate eras and generations is very important to hi light. Conan is reacting the way he is because there is no reason that this format of show would be popular other than the format that it exists on. Subscription based, or not with adds included creates a format for the youth to be influenced in anyway your algorithm sees fit. Where as in his era, everyone was being influenced by big advertisement to choose certain products and avenues of living. Very important to think about folks. This wasn’t just a season finally but rather a plea for help and guidance.
Every second pure gold.
Subtle shot at Leno lol.
Amazing 😂😂😂
Conan is the greatest of all time in everything he does. Best hot ones episode of all time❤😂🎉, I think it's possible this couldve killed him but he's an absolute legend. 61 and destroyed 21 seasons of guests much younger then him seriously electrifying. Conan is so wise, gave really interesting insightful glimpses into his life and the entertainment industry/late night. Had sean seriously impressed and cracking up looks like they had a blast. I'm a huge Conan Obrien needs a friend fan and this episode was amazing
i love how conan keeps asking permission to put the chicken wings in his pockets. You can tell he's trying to let go of control but he's a natural TV show leader so he is very crafty when it comes to being in the "guest" position. He is leading while being the guest. very fun to watch.
This absolutely has to surpass the Gordon Ramsey episode
Conan consuming this much spice made me think he's gonna turn into the Kwisatz Haderach, any second.  (I'm lying. I think this is the first or second episode I've watched. I don't know how spicy any of this is.)
best episode ever!
That Irish guy is a BEAST and we love him!! Go Coco!! ROFL..
This is the best thing I've seen on the internet for a while!
Conan is the goat
Every guest around wing 3 Always says "I thought this was going to be worse" and then look by wing 5 and 6 😂
OUTSTANDING
Conan, one of the true good guys.
conan better still be with us
Absolute power of Conan to treat the hot sauce with contempt is amazing
Carson would be proud
This interview was hilarious. Conan is my goat
The change of shot to the bottles tipped over, pouring out on the table mid speech about comedy was perfect, obsessed!
There's a reason Conan's considered the greatest host He can make an already good episode even funnier with his surprise gags
Yes. Conan. The best.
Dr. Arroyo is hilarious. Love Conan!
The best  ever Hot Ones episode!!!!
Yeah...  stay away from drugs ....
I would want to know what happened to conan the very next day.
Sean was not ready
Conan is easily the best guest this show has ever had!
This was by far the funniest interview of them all 😂
That was amazing and one for the books.💕🐺
my favorite so far
That deserves a standing ovation! 👏👏👏  I must say it almost felt like his hair got redder by the end due to slathering and chugging the last few sauces.  There is also a brief flash of regret in his eyes. 😂😂😂 He knows what's coming.   As for the interview itself-- fantastic as always. So nice to hear him (rightly) praise your interview skills. 🎉
Most psychologically stable hot wings sauce eater ever. Great job Conan!
Conan IS THE BEST!
Great tv right there
I will continue to scream it from the rooftops until the day I die… Conan is the best talk show host. Kimmel, Fallon, etc… they all got nothing on Conan. Nobody is more effortlessly funny than Conan is. Being funny and entertaining is 80% of the job. Conan never fails to do exactly that.
Conan has endured Hollywood for decades. Do you think some 🌶️ sauce is gonna even make a dent at this point?
Conan is my favorite person in the whole world
Viva Conan O'Brien 🙌
That's a sad grasp at an attempt to become relevant again.
Aw man that was amazing I love that man 😂😂
Hi Sean. I want to watch a drag queen do this please. Maybe Bob, Monet or Trixie?
It almost traumatises me to watch this !!
Conan just called out every media platform by saying " this isn't a bit this is real life " for an old man to scream he feels alive while hot sauce is all over his face and hands.  Shows that he came with intention to wake the people up.   Life is here ,the question is ,will we live it ?
It ain't getting any better then Conan
One of the best Hot Ones episodes in a while 👏🏽
Conan is a legend and he feels like a by gone era of comedy and I like that
The greatest episode of all time!
Best Hot Ones ever!!!
this is the best episode.
I see Conan. I immediately like.
Putting the chicken wings in his jacket is a top-tier bit
hardest ive laughed in awhile
Almost forgot how coco works. The level of energy, commitments, intelligence and of course humour is second to none.
Conan is spice god!
Sooooooo good😂
20:27 best moment this show has produced. You will not be able to change my mind. IRELAND BABY LONG LAY THE KING!
I salute to u sir connor Best episode ever
What Sean did to Ice Spice the other week was one thing but this was the nail in the coffin for me. I actively dislike him now. Conan absolutely destroyed this guy. Thank you Conan.
Conan has serious orange cat energy 🤪 It's going to be next level when he goes to the toilet later!!
I only see snippets of this show on social media but I see Conan so I had to watch the whole episode
The background music got really distracting. Just turn it down a few clicks please!
I was genuinely expecting Jordan Schlansky to pretend to be his doctor  What a phenomenal episode, God I missed Conan in the talk show style format
OUT RAGEOUS
I'm a great fun of this show, but I have never seen anything like this....maaad.😮😮
The legend
Did not disappoint. Conan is the man.
One of the true greats, absolutely fantastic content
Conan is WILD. I love that man.
best episode ever. Conan is king!!
Conan deserves the credit of one of the best comics of all time generation. Simpsons, SNL, late night. He should be top 10 comedians all time. However, he’s often forgotten about and underrated. It’s time for the Conaissiance
I'm actually kinda scared right now.
GOAT
Conan... STILL the GOAT.
Is Conan ok? Have we checked on him? 😂
Absolutely the most insaneeee episode 😂😂😂
A god among mere mortals.
You know he felt a tremendous pain, but all the hosting, dealing with broadcasting companies and keeping it going just made him perfect in hiding it. I wonder now how many bits there are where Conan has a horrible headache, because you'll probably never tell. They all good.
This. Was. EPIC!
what a fkin hero x'D
Conan is comedic gold. greatest episode ever might as well end the show here
His coke dealer could not have asked for a better endorsement!!!!   That stuff must be pure from the coca fields.  Just Wow!
what a beast
Somebody please give us an update on how Conan is doing. That man obliterated those wings and sauces in the most disrespectful way known to man lol
Ok.  I’m settling in for this one. But you have got to snag Ryan Reynolds for next season!
funniest episode ever (or in tie with Maya Rudolph's Loot skit)
That has to be the funniest h9t ones ever can't stop laughing 😂😂😂
what ever you paid him pay him double
20:27 Anyone remember the gravy? Conan loves things SMOTHERED
THATS COMMIT TO THE BIT BABY
This is the best episode of hot ones! How can you top this episode Sean?! Thank you for finally guesting the funniest, smartest, kindest talk show host. Love you Conan!
What an absolute legend.
Hilarious. Love this episode.
“You can't stop me from being who I am. I am what I am.” Bro dropped a golden line and thought we wouldn’t notice.
Listen, if you like Conan .  You need to go to the podcast Conan needs a friend, the 1st Nicole Byer episode.   Listen to it, cry laugh and then come.back and thank me
Love you Conan!
This is so good that transcends comedy, the level of commitment really inspires
Please take this man to a real Doctor 🤣🤣
I’ve never seen Sean laugh like that, Conan is the goat
chaos
Conan is just to funny 💀😂
Good guest, a guy knows what makes a good show, host and a guest
WHAT A G!
Best hot ones guest ever 👏👏👏
A comedian who has never complained about cancel culture, not being able to tell jokes, and has always strived to reinvent himself. Conan is a legend.
I haven't laughed this much in a while. Thanks Conan ;)
This is the best episode ever 😂
Might as well end the show here. Nothing will ever top this.
That was bombastic in every way. I have never seen Shawn actually afraid for a guest until Conan. To Conan O'Brian, you are this generations Robin Williams. Do not change for a minute. It was an amazing season finale
Best promo for a show 😂😂 need to watch it now
now I'm hungry...
Let's make Conan have more views than Gordon Ramsey's 124M video
“Isnt this show supposed to be called hot ones, where are the hot ones?”  “Ill remember these words Conan”  No…. No you wont…
Why is he wearing Bill Burr's jacket? 😆
Conan is a legend in comedy and now wing eating. Nothing he can't do!  Having watched so many of these, this was by far the hardest I've laughed.
MISSION OVER ACHIEVED! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
21:08 Peak Conan 😂
Might be the best I’ve ever seen Conan the goat
this is the best hahaha!!
Well, Conan came in and took the number 1 spot for guests
He turned into Rick Sanchez at the end 😂😂
Chairman of the bored! Lol iykyk
Im sorry but terrible host. Just a miracle that the stars appear. The model js better than the execution
My eyes are watering. Conan is THE best!!
- You're not a doctor, are you? - I should be  That guy is gold.
Best guest ever!!!
This is by far my favorite Hot Ones episode to date 😂
There have been several times in my life I thought Conan must be at the top of his game, but he doesn’t quit! Man is a powerhouse and now he is the king of spice 🌶️🔥 Thank you Sean, thank you Conan, for the best Hot Ones episode ever.
9:30 17:40
Love how he take over the show😂😂😂
Conan is always so entertaining for me. I live in EU where... It's not so safe nowadays. But when I click on some video with Conan I smile and I feel joy. Every time. I would hug him if I met him. He's really a great guy.
I haven't laughed this hard at a YouTube video maybe ever. This was exquisite. Conan is a treasure.
sorry too cringy
Doctor Nick got old!
love conan
He has used this analogy before, but I have to say it. The older Conan gets, the more he looks like our former president Tarja Halonen.
Absolute legend!
😂😂😂
Best episode by far!
Greatest
This has to be the top hot ones episode ever. Conan is a legend.
LEGENDARY
Wow . I see Conan a little different now. Dude is a beast
I remember aeeing a comment when he left the show saying he should do a travel show....and he actually did it..m
This is my favorite one of all time.
This is the first time I've questioned the validity of this show... I use Carolina reaper sauce heavily every day... I could not wipe it on my face. These sauces had to of been altered for him. It's just straight up saucenanigans.
Цей чоловʼяга- щось неймовірне! Або в нього 👑 (хвороба)😂🎉🎉🎉
one of the most incredible and maybe the most disgusting episode of the show yet, including that time aubrey plaza snorted milk
Reminds me of watching old Robyn Williams
This is the greatest Hot Ones performance ever.
many very important things were thrown there, that definition of 110%... that is no joke, it means FULL COMMITMENT + "a little extra" and that "little extra" is simply to do things you didn't know you could do, new generations MUST WATCH THIS.
Conan just became the wing king 👑 legendary
He turned into Rick by the end of the episode.
I dont think ive heard sean laugh quite as much as he did with conan
The GOAT.
The best hot ones episode ever.
A white guy enjoying spice, is this Dune?
Conan is a legend. Professional, funny, creative. I wish he was still on some form of late night talk show. He was the best.
Conan channeling his inner Chris Farley and saving a lacklustre season!
I love you Conan, thank you for everything you've done for comedy.
Conan is the goat . The spice lord himself !
Saw Conan on TBS live audience like 5 times. Always a good time he is the best late night host evee.
24:17 The aftermath of Hurricane Conan
I never laughed so hard. This was so good.
Thumbnail looks like Conan is about to start cursing loudly in German.
BEST EP EVER
I still don’t know how he did this.   Neither do magicians.
How’s he not on fire!!!!!
I love Conan! What a pro :)
Conan’s ability to be a professional one minute and then batsh*t insane the next is quality entertainment. Here it is aided by the hot sauce but it’s happened plenty of times without it.
Best guest ever
Been watching hot ones for years and years. Can easily say this was the BEST HOT ONES EPISODES ever!!!   Haven't really followed Conan that much, but this made me a huge fan. Kudos!!
He should be turning inside out right about now.
my mom gave me a TV in my room, in like middle school, but then told me i wasn't allowed to watch it past 11. like wut? of course im gonna stay up every night, making me tired for school, and watch conan. are you kidding?! what a legend!
Best Hot Ones episode. Ever.
Have they canceled explain that gram part cause that was interesting
You should Try to get Penn Badgley on the show
RIP CONAN ITS BEEN LOVELY TO SEE YOU
If there was ever a debate who the greatest late night host of our generation was I think it's safe to say it's over. Guy never lectured you with his political stance and always kept the focus on making people laugh no matter at who's expense. A lot of people in entertainment could learn from Conan. True GOAT
I want to see the water buffalo footage
It gets so hot you can see the plastic surgery melting in his face by the end.
I love Conan describing being alone in the tundra as a comedy vaccum, because it immediately reminded me of an iconic Mighty Boosh bit. Howard alone in the tundra: "Vince dead. All is lost. So alone. Wind my only friend". The wind whispering: "I hate you". Howard: "Shut up, wind!"
GOAT
this is definitely memorable
Don't worry Conan, I really enjoyed this video and I'm only 40 years younger than you.
He’s just freaking hilarious. One of the best guest on the show, best one in a while. The whole thing is not just an interview for him, it’s a bit. No one does it like Conan
when he drank straight from the sauces, it was like watching a beautiful horror movie. i had to close my eyes out of disbelief . great great
Channeling Chris Farley. Amazing.
CALL THE WIFE
The Irish guy who grew up on no spice, ate like they were dipped in mashed potatoes. 👏👏👏👏
This is the best one yet!!!!!
Best episode in years!
Conan's denim is pretty fire. This was on the greatest episodes.  Conan never pussied out like so many do.
Best GuesT ever!!!!
Oh my goodness gracious me
Best episode ever. 😂
When did Conan become Jim Belushi? Hilarious
This might have been the greatest Hot Ones episode of all time...
Conan is trying way too hard to appear funny or cool.  This is a disaster.
I'm both thoroughly undeniably entertained and certainly disturbed
Try the chilli factory they have some worl record holding chilli sauces based in Morissette N.S.W Australia
😂😂😂😂😂
There is something so deeply wrong with Conan O'Brien.  And I respect it.
That was the funniest thing that I have seen in a very long time. Conan is a Barbarian.
Wow!!!
"You're not a doctor, are you..." "I should be"
Look up the hic cup cure on SHARK TANK! it's instant and a miracle
best episode ever
He's the goat. No dispute.
oh my
When he threw his fingers up as Nixon and they are red ohhh boy.
Something tells me Conan might actually be able to out pizza the Hutt.
Get this guy a napkin
I love him. He's the only comedian who doesn't seem to have an agenda. Pure comedy.
You guys should have Mike Tyson on the show
Can anybody top this one, I don't think so.
best episode yet
Best guest ever🤣❤️
And with that Conan goes down as the greatest Hot One's guest of all time by a mile. The comedy, the commitment to be increasingly more insane as it goes. Never showing the amount of pain he had to be going through. Theres nobody better, cheers to Conan. An absolute legend
Conan has always been a hero to me. I visited NBC studios when I was like 12 years old and made a point to go to his set. I totally messed up on the “roller coaster ride with Conan” green screen experience, but that’s okay. I still had a great time!   “In the year 2000!!!”
Wait so who is the guest?
Respect to my fellow Irish American for taking that sauce like a champ.
Have always loved Conan and he did not disappoint.
One of the best if not the best episode ever.
literally the best hot ones ever.
I love conan since the 90s but i actually thought he was really uncomfortable and overcompensating here. It came off like robin williams with his manic comedy bits.  Love you conan! Your podcast rock.
Suddenly I'm laughing so hard. You know it's truly funny when you don't see it coming
Sean could have left Conan alone in the room, and he would find a way to entertain us.
Wish I could like it 10 times. Amazing. Conan is a master of his craft.
i think this is the The Number One..how about your guys??
My number one guest request, and best episode to date.
Incredible. I screamed each time Conan took a swig off the bottles. What were the next few hours like for him?? 🤯
Sean was loving this, he couldn't stop laughing. Conan killed!
Conan! Thanks for making me laugh and forgetting what dark times i was going through when i was younger.
Conan is the Hot Ones GOAT!!!!
Conan is so awesome!! His comedy just makes me laugh sooooo much!! Conan you rock!!!!!!
Sean was stumped.
Might be the best episode ever!
Conan & Blaine. The GOATs
That was hands down one of the best Hot Ones I've ever seen.
Always hated O'Brian, this hasn't changed anything
I love Conan oh my god. No one will ever make me laugh as hard as him
Conan is the funniest man alive. Period. 🔥🫚
Conan da goat
This man is the icon of all icons. He put those wings down with finesse. We love you Conan 💕
I love Conan ❤
Conan is 100% the BEST!! GO BIG OR GO HOME!! This is the funniest thing ive seen in a long time..  Happy Birthday Conan now go sit on a tub of ice cream for a few days..🫥😉🙂😊😆😂🤣🤣🤣
The shadow under Conan’s nose is very becoming 😂
By far the best Hot Ones interview!
Conan endorsing Sean like that is crazy. , what an honor and well deserved.
Gods I think this was my favorite one yet xD
Lol
THIS IS TO YOU!  CALL THE WIFE!!  😂😂😂
Wow I notice that I have an unpopular opinion. For me Hot Ones is about getting to know the real person of a celebrity. I do not want to have them play a scripted role bringing along their doctor (haha) and taking over the whole show. That's actually very rude.  It was entertaining and all but still not why I usually like hot ones.
That end bit when he was high out of his mind on pepper X was pure gold!
EPIC… no other words!
❤❤❤❤❤ love Conan
CONAN OBRIEN IS THE GOAT!!!
If this is not fake, oh my lord! Conan is the GOAT.
Jesus Conan
The pain he is feeling is unfathomable
Around 22:50 you can definitely tell there was a cut where Conan had a nasty upchuck. But somehow it gets even better after that.
From the Irish unseasoned food to the end - perfection. Missed Conan!!
I would ask for a floor pillow to sit on and start doing YOGA 😂 just a thought 🤔 thought 🧐
The only thing that cools off ghost pepper or hotter-popcorn salt. It will burn worse. Wait a few seconds, drink some cola. The heat is absolutely GONE. This was learned about midway of 40 plus years of eating habanero, ghost, reaper, jigsaw papers from my garden.
Conan eats insanity pepper, goes on a mysterious voyage outside the hit ones studio to find his soul mate.
Goat moment!
"A Charlie Rose show where you eat hot wings"....that's funny =)
I can't stop laughing 🤣
There can be no further seasons after this. This is the end. It was a great run.
Compare this beautiful performance with the boring self-entitled cringe participation of kevin hart or the delusional dj Kaleb. May all gods bless Conan.
I was told that You NEVER drink water 💦💧 to cool things down,,, just Milk Chocolate Or Coconut milk 🥛🥥
17:30 Conan: “You tried to talk…” Also Conan: : 18:02
This and his interview with James Lipton are now my all time favorite Conan interviews!👏🏽👏🏽
That was tiresome.
holy guacamole this is peak Hot Ones
Everyone said the interview gets chaotic and I kept wondering when. Then he licked the wing with Da Bomb... And I knew
The GOAT
Feel Alive and get some bite of a cupcake 🧁 after the bites that are insanely hot 🔥🥵
I literally was just bingewatching conan's episodes and I see this? F yes
How was this funnier than the SNL Hot Ones sketch with Maya Rudolph as Beyonce?
heckin love Conan
I used to enjoy late night talk shows especially Conan. Would stay up late just to watch. Now it's all lame woke, politically correct and ga-ee and pandering propaganda for Democrats. Haven't seen one in a long time.
I can’t tell you a great recipe for hotwings, but I can tell you that if you baste the wings heavily with Dave’s Insanity Sauce & Pappy’s Moonshine Hot BBQ Sauce, someone is going to the emergency room. Invariably, it’s the guy who refuses to get burned out & quit eating the wings. 🔥
Best episode yet. Can't go wrong with Conan.
I never really found him funny until now. But he was very good here. Fair play.
conan my love
best and funniest episode yet
I literally did a spit take. This was incredible!!!
This is easily top 0.05% of hot ones.
Disgusting. And impressive.
I’ve never laughed this hard at a Hot Ones episode.  This might be my favorite episode yet.
National treasure, Coco must be protected at all cost! This man has done the unthinkable; so committed to  his artistry ❤
"There's comedy in the Old Testament" 😂
Great episode
We r going down with a firework! He wants to be so cool, but he looks like a Zombie xD I hope he survived the night. ^^
The best one ☝🏻
whoa
First We Feast and then we CELEBRATE 🥂
Love you Conan! This probably isn't much of a compliment, but Conan's interviews with people made me realize how abhorrently bad Carson Daily was and ...okay not interviews but in terms of funny, how bad James Corden IS. No past tense. He can't fix that.
I think this is how a lot of us see ourselves on Hot Ones. Love you Conan.
One of the funniest things I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂
Best episode ever
What if Conan is not joking and can't feel spiciness?
Man, we love Conan folks.
🔥 HOTTEST HOT ONES EVER. CONAN IS A FIREY HOT WING GOD. 🔥
Fkn dead 💀💀💀 the best
Conan once again proves he is the Master. Craziest hot-ones. Don’t see it being beat.
Never mind as a Conan fan. Still not.
Stomach hurts from so many belly laughs 🤣🤣🤣
This has got to be the funniest episode I have ever seen!!!  Conan is the man!!! He was articulate while dying. Awesome
Conan is the greatest to ever do it, folks. You know you've done something right as an interviewer when Conan not only compliments your abilities, but also wants to deliver an iconic episode of the show and give it his all, while still hitting all the marks. A true titan of the industry.
Best Hot Ones since Dave Grohl and Gordon Ramsay. So good. Love Conan! 😂
Thank you Conan!! <3 All I gotta say. Thank you!
This guy never aged. Wth
hes the best in the business by god
How did the bottles get knocked over in the end? I want to see that outtake!!!
The funniest person of all time
"He's not the best. But he's affordable."
Definitely a top 5 episode. Conan is timeless.
Truly remarkable.
Conan turned his guest appearance into a bit 😂
Needed a good laugh. The snot at the end really got me. Pretty funny! 😂
Conan was an absolute beast!!!! No one in Hot Ones History could match or beat that energy or performance 😂😅🥵🙌🏻👏🏻
NOPE? Something not right about this guy. Not right at all. He is way way too manufactured.
I don’t know why but I feel like the ghost of Chris Farley takes over Conan’s body. I was literally tearing up laughing so hard watching this at 2 am. Terrific!
remove the da bomb sauce, it just disgusting. it's not a good sauce.
Conan: Only I may dance🕺
Absolute Legend ‼️‼️
How does Conan O'Brien not have a star on the Hollywood walk of fame?
Best HOT ONCE EVERRRR 😂
Absolutely hilarious.
Conan kills it  Funny show!!!
Absolutely stellar. Great comedians are invaluable. Life would be far more miserable without guys like Conan.
Conan & Shia Lebouf are the only wing eaters that beat Sean
By far, the best interview you've had.
Conan is the best
Man I can’t stand jimmy Kimmel or Fallon or most other night time hosts. But Conan just has this genuine persona and doesn’t try to be somebody else. He’s just him and I love it
the hotter the wing, the deader conan's eyes get
TIL: Conan has no taste buds...
$1,000 says that Conan’s salsa was fake and he made it more entertaining than others that had real salsa lol
Best episode.
This was the best ever!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I have seen a lot of really good episodes of this show, but this is definitely the best one I've seen. Perfection
If I could save only 3 white ppl, He would be all 3
This is so off the rails.  Conan remains the king.
I'm just here in case there is talk of gerbils
jesus Conan, you f*kn killed it.
best finale
The bea Arthur reference was laugh out loud
Conan is my favorite TV host ever. Nobody gets close.
That was beyond brilliant. I'll be laughing for a couple days.
That. Was. EPIC!
This is my favorite episode
I was afraid to rub my eyes after watching this
If anyone here has even had 'one drop' of the DA BOMB. You'd know exactly how crazy what he just did was. Unreal.
I don’t feel it 😅 but his eyes 👀 say’s otherwise RED Af and full of water 😂😂😂 his going to feel it when he goes to the 🚽🚽 his 🍑🍑 going to be on FIRE 🔥🔥
He’s an ICON
Best show ever!!!!!!!
>shows up >best guest ever >refuses to elaborate  >leaves
Bro this is gonna be a classic
The best to ever do it.
I've been a fan of Conan's since I was little and I turned 30 2 months ago. This was amazing! Best guest that has been on here! 100 out 10!
22:25 You can audibly hear the set workers react to Conan drinking the last dab.
Spice lord!!!
This was an experience to watch. Conan, unleashed with hot sauce all over his face and feelings. I don’t believe anyone will ever top this 😮😅🎉
Conan is true performer and a mad man and still manages to say profound words of wisdom through the end. Legend
Legendary episode. Instant Classic
“80’s coke is insanely powerful” 😂
Top 3 funniest hot ones interview. Up there with Gordon Ramsey and Pete Davidson 😂
What a monster!
So cool 😎 he loves to travel 🧳😀
I love Conan but that was a hard watch, a lot of saliva, milk, sweat, mucus 😂
David Blaine was also seemingly unphased by the wings, but that is a man who has spent his life training to overcome immense physical pain. Conan did this just in the name of comedy 😮
To quote my hero Popeye😂😂😂
Conan is a one of a kind genius. Sticking wings in his pocket, and Dr. Arroyo, and just being Conan, so dang good. I love his podcast.
😂❤😂 he is naturally funny 🤣🤣
Conan slathering that final drumstick in pure pepper x sauce and then devouring it like a champ is one of the most insane things I've ever seen. Pepper X is an unhinged degree of spice. More than a drop and you will be hiccuping and slamming your fist on the countertop while cursing yourself for overpouring. Conan really is built different. What a legend.
That was the best!
"I admire a guy who hosts Hot Ones and also wears suede"
That was by far the best one yet! Conan is hilarious!!
"And I don't care. I don't care anymore!"
Tops Paul Rudd.
How is Conan both the smartest and nastiest guest ever? 😅😅😅
God im regret didnt watch this sooner😂
Master class
🤎💜💙💚🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Next week's guest is f#*ked.
" I told him not to " -  Andy
this is one of the best episodes ever!!!
mfcking legend
this episode of Hot Ones brought to you by Charmin Ultra Soft toilet paper.  Conan's on his 3rd pack right now.
I NEED to see Timothy Olyphant do this.
BEST.
most disgusting hot ones, congrats!!!!
Conan was epic in this, but now imagine Robin Williams...everybody would get 6 packs.
Why they still doing the two table thing? Is america still doing the Covid thing? Canada is over it
the cutback at 23:01 had me in tears.
22:30 I'm somewhat convinced that Conan was having a vision quest from the heat at this point.
I love this so much ❤😂
This is hilarious
That was incredible and a demonstration of pure comedy talent and why Conan should still be hosting The Tonight Show right now.
Getting Chris Farley vibes at 21 minutes 😂❤
That might be the best HotOnes interview I’ve ever seen. He literally knocked all the bottles down horizontally 😂
I feel like I just had a fever dream watching this. Wat
What a great show. Hilarious Conan makes it one to remember. I always like when they compliment Sean for doing his research and asking good questions and compliment him as an interviewer. The doctor thing had me laughing, Conan is in his 60s now and chugging hot sauce like a shot! I would die!
Holy SHEEEEET.  My respect for Conan has gone up exponentially.
alright i’ll give in i’ve always avoided conan as i always avoid talk show hosts but this guys actually funny
Conan, King of quirk
THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LIVING LEGEND. Best episode ever. Thank you for the peak show biz Mr. O’Brien.
Everyone forgot he was moleculo and not a simple mortal.
Jesus,  he just gave a shout out to the 3 Stooges! Who does that?? Effin GOAT! 😅😅😅
"Read widely and read well" may be the best advice I've ever heard.
Great episode !
My stomach hurts from laughing so hard at this
Whoa what a massive difference in head size on these two people
Best episode to date…by far!
Team coco 😂
Conan was everything we could hope for. Sean looked legitimately worried at the end.
The keeping the wings in his pocket got me every time
I had to go rewatch the clip where he showed his bruise from the Water Buffalo. It was an impressive bruise but I still can't believe he didn't name any of his animal encounters with Jarod Miller.
hail to the king
Hey, Conan's birthday is the same day as me and my wife's anniversary
I have watched Conan since he first started Late night.  I always thought that (even though Jay Leno has my upmost respect and outclasses Conan in his own right) He would have been my choice to take up the Carson slot, when Johnny retired.  I actually was very upset when Conan Quit and went to TBS (I am a part of a poor family and TBS was not a channel that freely broadcast).  I have more respect for his comedy, career, and acting now move than ever.  I love Hot foods, and vowed that if I ever became celebrity status that 'First We Feast' would be my first plug, and that I would smother all the wings in the final dab and push through to the end.  Now I don't have to.  Conan, you did it for me.  You did it for us all (because F*** THAT S***!!).
Conan O'Brien...a true professional.
Hot ones getting the ol’ connan bump 9:40
This is the single best bit of comedy on YouTube right now.
BEST EPISODE EVER!! No one does it like Conan.🔥🤘🏽
Jennifer Lawrence currently has 14M views on her Spicy Wings video.  Let's see where Conan's will be in 9 months.  Remindme! 9 months.  Oh wait, this is not reddit
EPIC.
How did I know conan would end up covered in hot sauce?
wow  conan  is a beast
I very badly want to see the footage of Conan being bucked off of a Water Buffalo
I wish we could see more of Conan's old TV show "audience" actors
This gotta be the best episode of this season, by far. Hands up, pants down, conan you're unbelievable. Mad respect
He’s Jimmy Neutron and the Joker with the super hero powers of Superman! Never seen anything like this on Hot Ones! Conan is the Hot Ones God!
Greatest episode!
22:35 The ‘oh my god’ and complete terror on Sean’s face 😂😂
😱
so sublime...there is funny everywhere!!....!!!....in the OT, the NT, doen/t have to be 10 yrs ago.....blah blah blah....anyhoo.  [yes, there is funny everywhere].  And...wow...I was surprised at how well Conan (O'Brien) handled the hot wings....amazing...I wish I was there live, that would be amazing!!....!!!)!!!
He’s so unpredictable 😂😂😂I love it..What an absolute legend .A very entertaining episode 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Conan was awesome! Get this Irish prik a show again! 😅😅😅
The best one, simple THE BEST ONE!!!!!!!!
this has to be the best episode of this show ever
Why does Conan look like Gwildor?
The real king of late night. Genuine legend
Man..   What an interview.  👏 👏
Kevin Nealon should take notes
Get lil Reese on here 😂😂😂
Read widely. Read well. Best advice ever.
Sean asks good questions but can't play around or improv at all.
I could not stop laughing this entire episode.  This man is legendary, haha 🤣
100  % on board. I buy for Conan.
That was hilarious
Probably the greatest Hot Ones
Have to say one of the best moments ever! I died laughing
When I heard the "waneee wanaaa waneeee"  I knew it was over
I don't think this Conan guy can handle spice.
YAY CONAN :D
Words cannot express how much I love this man. A comedic genius and a genius genius.
This was, hands down, the best Hot Ones episode ever! Conan is next level man!
Great job Conon
I love Conan, always have.
I love conan so much 😂😂
AMAZING 😂
I never want to see Conan eat again.
I'm sorry but it was Shia the funniest guest, now Conan takes it 😂😂
Legend
Without a doubt best Hot Ones episode ever. I was crying laughing!! Conan - You are a LEGEND
That was amazing, like watching an uncle go through a manic episode.
CoCo is a LEGEND! Let him know he is the best! Been a fan of him for decades. Grew up with him and the newbies are nothing compared to CoCo!
Holy shit…I haven’t whole-heartedly laughed at something that hard in a LONG time 🤣 comic genius 😎
That’s IT!!! That’s the best one EVER!!! What a LORD of comedy…
This is the most unhinged episode yet 😅
Great show.  Wing drop!
Please credit the actor who played the doctor.
Wooooooow
Literally my hero has filmed the most outrageous and best episode of Hot Ones! A true Legend. Conan is the absolute best in the business. Been a fan for 25 years! 😂😂😂🤣
❤️‍🔥🤣🙌🏼
This is by  far the funniest episode of Hot Ones EVER. No close second. The doctor🤣🤣
holy epic episode
Oh man. Awesome
I am so proud I have been choosing Conan to be next to me all my life to make me laugh. What a monster of entertainment. Thank you for making me laugh so hard in this episode. Internet starts now!
I about died when he took that last mouthfull of milk. Thanks Conan for keeping comedy golden!
Why does Dr. Arroyo seem so familiar?
Conan is on a whole different level and I am grateful I live at the same time in history as this brilliant hilarious man.
Please, for the love of all that is holy, please tell me Conan reported on how horrible it was when it went out the other side!  Doing a few hot challenges myself; one can fake it when you eat it, but the bill comes due.
Not even Eric Andre could match Conan’s energy😂  Pulled out all the stops went through the roof straight for orbit
Pack it up, the show is over. No one will ever come close to this.
I was watching this on my phone in bed, but this is big tv watching. Conan is the ultimate showman.
Best ‘hot ones’ ever. Period. 😊
That Conan is gonna go places! 😄
Conan is absolute king
I didn’t know me and Conan have something in common: Sean is also my favorite interviewer HANDS DOWN.
Conan is legit..always has been
CALL THE WIFE!! 💀
Is that Max Weinberg?
Curious to know if you started hot to mild.  Then the questioning would revert to if they could even taste it.  Just a thought.
*ABSOLUTE CINEMA*
I named my dog Conan.  He was kind of a spazz too. 😂
"That's so MEAN............... I'm gonna go with Warren Harding." Hahah
*"The True King of The Late Night"*       22:25 I have never seen anyone who is committed to the bit this much 🔥🔥🔥 straight up drank hottest spiciest sauce
This one is my favorite
My all time favorite episode. I’m glad you got it! My mental health thanks you ❤
Bro rubbing his nippies had me 😂😂😂
One of the best!!
I love the animatics, I wasnt expecting that.
GOAT
Funniest episode yet! Conan is the best
Behold, the perfect guest. Nobody does it better than Conan.
This is probably the most unhinged hot ones interview ever. 😭
Conan was always my favorite in late night. He got a raw deal and was replaced by hacks, but he continued to push and thrive and still makes me laugh involuntarily. Such an incredible comic mind.
“Was it a 4 year medical school?” “Uh it was supposed to be” 😂
What a legend. Never fails to entertain. Cant wait for his show.
Best episode yet
Wrote the best Simpsons. Starred on the best Murderville. Guested on best Hot Ones. Legend among legends.
Best episode to date 😂👍🏻
I'm going to watch this every time I have a bad day. I laughed so hard 😂
Jesus didn't expect ALL THAT!! Was super happy to see Conan on Hot Ones though )))
Literally the best episode hands down!
Ghandi, Popeye, Conan
Bow down to the conan!!! Incredible. Wow
one of the best interviews ever and how Connan highlight how good of an intervier Shawn is its just AMAZING!!!GREAT SHOW SUPER FUNNY!!
Best guest ever
Probably the best episode of Hot Ones, beats chef Ramseys episode imo.
#1
❄️
The Doctor checking the tongue with the Stethoscope....  "Not good"... 😂😂😂😂
The best episode ever!
I'll keep my negative comments to myself.. Sean Evans you're awesome as always!!!! The other fella, not so much.🤷
Dr. Arroyo has some Max Weinberg energy going on.
By far the most unhinged episode of this show I've ever seen. Conan did amazing.
yay sombody we know. and he made me die laughing
The wings of death melted his mind 😂😂😂
God conan is the funniest human alive
Conan also helped write the golden era of the simpsons. A true genius
🧡🧡🧡
Conan is a spice GOD!
Still the best.
❤
I just KNEW this one would be fire!
Only time I felt the need to do a standing ovation… at home.
i think this is against the geneva convention
My first time commenting on a hot ones episode. I still feel the muscles on my face from smiling and laughing this whole episode. I'm battling cancer while starting a new career and raising three kids and you guys made all that stress melt away. You deserved that compliment from Conan Sean. Superb show, both sides of the table.
Conan saying its not a bit is the best bit ever
Best episode I've seen in a long time. Conan absolutely blew this one away. He's a true showman. Great job Sean!
Beyond the amazing interview (as always), Conan is a GOAT at this challenge.  Well done!
Early 2000s used to watch Conan as a kid here in Finland, was just about school age so didnt understand English yet, but always enjoyed the energy of it, subtitles helped.   I refuse to believe there can be anything bad in Conan. Such a character and one of the rare good ones in show business. What a blast this episode was, thank you!
Straight GANGSTA Conan u the man
Best there’s ever been.  Good night.
I loved hearing the crew gasp when he sipped the last dab.
I LOVED THIS SO MUCH!
Since when did they not show sean eat the wings?
Best interview ever!
I was gonna watch his show even without this plug at the end but now i’m sold
Woooohhh hahahahha épic
Best late night host alive. Da bomb is always the killer.
Y’all should really consider having @thatmexicanot on the show it would go viral let’s make the collab happen!!! 💯
Robin William's vibe on the latter half
Can we please get Conan to host the Oscar’s, just as popular but actually funny
Best episode ever
Conan saying Dorya at the end!!  Conan in Tekken 8 confirmed?! Lol
Conan wrote for the Simpsons during its early years which are still some of the funniest of all time. His whit and creativity seem endless
Best episode by far !!! 😂😂😂 love Conan .
I hope conan lives a long and beautiful life. He will always be the king of late night.
The next Joker?!
Conan just acquired the power of rage
I’ve seen every episode. I am a very big fan. This is definitely top 3 of all time! Love that he took it to that level. F’in Hilarious
The epic diarrhea he will experience probably warrants its own documentary- Conan's Run
Step aside Gordon Ramsay, we have a new King of Hot Ones
Greatest guest ever. Period.
This put the biggest smile in my face, used to hate but fully love him now
Conan is forever and always a legend!!!
Power over spice. Power over all.
i feel sorry for their toilets🤣🤣
Conan living his dream of making the host uncomfortable 😂  Add this one to the hot ones HOF 👏
Conan just raised the bar way too high, there has to be a Hot Ones hall of fame dedicated for episodes such as this one. 10/10.
Best hot ones interview ever. Now we need Triumph the comic insult dog.
I fully understand why people in the crowd continually shouted "I love you Conan!" on his shows.
Conan, you’re a monster!  😂♥️
This is all time.
There's so many reasons why this is by far the best episode
Wow...that's all I've got LOL
Shout-out of the late night talk show hosts of my childhood: Letterman, Conan, and The Other Guy
Conan for President!
that was disgusting
Wow! Best Hot Ones ever
I reached Nirvana by laughing so much
Dr arroyo is a longtime conan writer
“Call the wife!” 😂😂😂😂🎉🎉
That escalated quickly
The obstacle is the way
Weird you guys had a 6"4 hideous Norwegian woman with a head that resembles a rotting pumpkin on the show. Good stuff.
Conan O'Brian... committed to the bit.
Savage af
... tf did I just watch 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I cried, love conan. best episode ever
I love that Conan always starts answering after the first question mark. Good lesson for interviewers.
Conan is my little meowmeow
One of the best eps
Best ever
I remember staying up late to wait for his show at night during undergrad. And I very distinctly remember what happened with “that other guy” and how gracious Conan was talking about what happened as he left NBC. I love you CoCo!!! I’ll follow watch/listen to whatever medium you produce in whatever format!!!
Ayeee yooo one of the best hot ones by far for sure had me laughing and giggling most of the time shout out man🍻
LOL Conan is a diamond in the rough.
Favorite episode...love Conan👍
Conan O'Brien is amazing!!
Conan is great. I knew he'd have the best reactions to the spicy wings.   I didn't even know about his travel show and I'll definitely be watching it, and I'm not a TV watcher. His travel "remotes" were his funniest moments on his YouTube channel.
When someone can say "There's funny everywhere" with sauce all over his face while playing it completely straight, I think they know what they're talking about.
Conan the lord of spice
Maybe the best thing I've ever seen in my whole life
Of all Hot Ones episodes, this is the hardest I've laughed. Conan shaped my sense of humor growing up, through both The Simpsons and Late Night. Absolute legend. Love ya, Coney.
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen Lynch Version von Belushi O'Bland Food Upringing has just... destroyed the show? He was, basically, chugging Da Bomb. This will stay with me for a while.
A voice of our generation; he is spicy, he is milky, but most of all, he is O'Brien.
Conan is the new Tom Green hahahahaha
I never thought I could have enjoyed this episode even more.. Conan's comedy is different but I love it.. Talk show skills are second to none..
Incredible
What a pro. Absolute brilliance.
what a mess he turned into by the end LOL
I can't with the hair
That was absolutely cinematic gold!! Beautiful well done absolutely will never forget this. Thank you so much 🙌
Catholics can handle a lot of suffering.
"Season 23" dawg it's a youtube channel
No contest, best guest thus far. Legend.
I don't have anxiety, but Conan, bruh... Chill. What a true SPICE LORD!
Now that is a season finally. WOW, loved it.
Hes a machine...
Old skool, hats off to Conan. Continues to demand intelligent back-and-forth dialog....at his age, somehow controls nerves to his mouth. Hats off to the man
lol "it's there"
BEST guest EVER!!!! I haven't laughed to tears in a looong time! ❤😂😂😂❤
W
Who IS this guy?!
A whale.
Conan is from now and forever the Frank Booth of Hot Ones.
Best episode ever.
Great
Brilliant
At least he admitted he overdid it. Like anything Conan does, a little bit (pun intended) goes a looooong way for me.
This should be the Series Finale. Nobody will top this. Well done Conan😂
Probably the best episode of all time.
Conan might be a serial killer
I love Conan ❤
by far... THE. BEST. EPISODE!
Was I the only one that was subconsciously waiting for him to touch his eyes with fingers covered in molten lava? However, a true professional like Conan, who has decades of experience performing with layer upon layer of makeup, never wavered. God Bless this man.
that was the best show love it
The most epic and memorable interview EVER. You gotta ❤ Connan
Thee epitome, of a fawkinnnn, SHOWMAN!!!!!! - Hats off to Conan.
Conan is the best, miss seeing him  nightly.. Podcast is fantastic
Best episode ever! Pack it in folks, we're done here.
I never would have expected this from Conan.
Oh Conan, you didn't need to do that. There are limits, and you didn't have to push yourself past them for us.
he really killed it
This was absolutely amazing
oh my god this is the best episode of hot ones
BEST. SHOW. EVER.
I'm gonna cry so hard when Conan passes away.
I knew Conan would be great but I didn't expect him to give the greatest performance and episode of Hot Ones History! lol
this episode is an all-timer
He looks like the joker. This is the real joker
Call me exaggerated, but this is one of the funniest pieces I have seen in many years. 😂
Bring back the old table setup
Maybe my favorite episode ever.  Only thing it was missing was a bear discovering itself.
❤Coco❤
Excellent video!  That was some real show business by Conan hahah
Most epic show to date! 😂😂😂😂
Conan being an absolute menace for half an hour. Drinking sauces… that’s his show now
Conan is wearing the same outfit in the picture at 12:50... intentional?  Great episode!
About to watch this one now. I guarantee this will be one of the 5 funniest episodes.
This killed me…. Hold the wings!
I didn't think the Gordon episode is ever gonna get topped but here we are
I've had that last sauce it was hot but dissipated quick.  Conan you are a rock star!
he killed it harder than any other guest, he spit in the face of fire disregarding all consequences... respect.
Best episode ever, love Conan!
This was disappointing. Not funny, just dumb.
BEST EPISODE EVER. This is peak
I love it!!!!!!😂 he is the best the best
Who is contouring conan's face? His blush is off the charts.
Wow
CALL THE WIFE!
What did I just see? An Irishman dominate hot ones!? What's going on?!
This was fantastic
Conan is a living cartoon character. Drinks the last dab which is basically lava in a bottle. 😂
Conan just took Hot Ones into the stratosphere. LEGENDARY
This.Was.Funny.  Bye.
Conan, you’re a legend.  You always have been, you always will be, and you will be forever. Drink that pepper x baby 😂😂😂
Please tell me that's Sona laughing in the background lol
Great episode, however I think it could be topped by Conan and Kevin Nealon together.
26:03 The difference between their tables 😂
👩🏻‍🦲🌶👨🏻‍🦰
Conan, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’m afraid I must diagnose you with long-form COVID
Conan dives right into the comedy and never looks back. He gives comedy a good name. Great episode.
What a G.
Conan is a beast. Fair play 👏🏼
24:34 His spittle 😂
legendary
that was epic
Im literally crying, Conan taught me so much in a way that I get inspired to live and enjoy life.
I dunno, Ice Spice or Conan? It’s tight.
in stitches towards the end of this gem 😂  one of the best .
24:15 I’m not sure about that part 😅
Conan is so unserious 😂 can't wait to hear him talk about this on his podcast!
all that liquid on his face at the end 🤢
I don't trust anyone that doesn't love Conan.
Now that I have seen what peak hot ones looks like, I wish we could have Chris Farley on a show like this too. ❤️
He is an amazing guy! 👨‍🦰
Even funnier than Steve-O!
I sincerely love Conan, legend
"CALL THE WIFEEEEE"
Immediate Classic
This was up there as one of the best. Both of you are so good and professional.
so i think conan didn't feel anything
Conan turned into Master Shake.
what a legend!
He probably had some miracle  berries before the shoot.
Bro , Conan GOAT.
Gold
Conebone69 did the thing!
I see Conan is entering his Hot Wings Joker Phase
The GOAT late night talkshow host
best episode ever!!!!!!!!!!!
It's really too bad that Robin Williams was never able to be on Hot Ones. Probably only person who could compete with this interview.
Omfg this guy 😂😂
My favorite episode, hands DOWN!❤️‍🔥
GOAT episode
This is so great!
what happened to Sean keeping pace with the guest? 😂
Conan's ability to pivot throughout his career has been soooo impressive to watch. And he just keeps getting better and better
23:50 peak comedy
Conans decision to not wipe his hands or face is great
I had tears in my eyes the whole time
This has eclipsed "Christopher Lloyd eating the beans under the bridge" as the grossest thing I've seen a funny person do.
Conan is a BEAST
I did not see that one coming ... That was amazing!
He's a yam alright.  I get it, but I don't see it.
This is the best episode.
Calling Jay Leno "the other guy" is classic
This might be the best hot ones ever….
THE BEST.
i fuking love this guy
I didn't know his birthday is near mine! Mine is the 17th! Happy early birthday conan👏
BEST SHOW EVER!!!
That was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.
Jesus.
It was Conan who brought the heat.
I love conan
PUT THIS IN THE ARCHEOLOGICAL RECORD.
What a finale!!! Best episode ever all facts Conan is a beast🔥🔥🔥
3M in less than 2 days? nice.
Conan is the best 👏
And the spittle shall fly!
Age: Unknown Real age: Timeless
Without a doubt, this is the best hot ones episode ever.
Dear. God.
GOAT episode. He went for it. Conan is the man.
Unhinged
Conan gets me everytime, he is the best!! Lol
One of the greatest <3 great episode, thanks for making it happen :)
Arnold Schwarzenegger next?
That was the most amazing feat I’ve ever seen. His ability to just ignore what was absolutely intense pain is just incredible. What a dedicated performer and showman.
This whole thing took me out!! 😆😭 Hands down the best hot ones so far, Conan is a legend!!
i lost it when he put the stethoscope on his tongue LOL
Possibly, no wait, definitely the best show. I’m crying right now and was extremely worried about Conan when he was eating “Da Bomb”. Hands down the best Hot ones in history. Thank you Conan and thank you Dr. Arroyo for your service!!!
Absolute comedy legend. Love you Conan
Conan shuts it down
Curse me for watching this while my wife is sleeping--I could not restrain my laughter.
Love this show and loved especially Conan's honesty and perfectly placed comedic timing. Thanks!
I love this guero!!!!!! Conan you the man!! Thanks for all the great laughs all these years 🫡
Forever the GOAT. He’s stayed hungry and will never stop trying to find the funniest bit. Thanks for this absolute iconic interview!
Conan is the man.
GAWDAMNNN, is Conan still alive after this one?! LOL
I don't know that this episode can ever be outdone.   It should be in it's own category so I don't have to choose a favorite episode out of my favorite episodes.
I love Conan so much.  What a performance
The Dr Arroyo bits had me HOWLING 🤣
I bet he has 4 years, tops.
Conan answering the question about what he would say to guests on his talk show when they would go to a commercial break.  "I always tried to make something happen, keep the rhythm going. And sometimes, if I couldn't keep them interested, I'd try to say something provocative. Like, "I bet you live 4 more years tops."  Incredible
i think conan is referring to that SUPER awkward interview when he was talking about when people go on talk shows and say "this isn't going well"😭😭😭
Conan's shows were the best but I think he was bit too unhinged here. I think acting like a complete idiot works when you are young. I was hoping for something witty and new, but all I got was old jokes and old guy eating like a toddler. The doc was the best part and even it got too repetative.
Been waiting for Conan since Mila Kunis said she would help getting him. It's been worth every freaking second of waiting.
absolute legend.
The Goat Conan folks...
"Desperate means lead to desperate measures"!
Is this Conan's best bit ever?
LOVED THIS! Excited for the show.
This is the best episode of the entire show.  Amazing.
This is probably in top 5 interviews on the hot ones ever.
I haven’t laughed like this in years. Thank you so much Conan. Been a fan since “the year 2000”
Conan is too intense for hot sauce.
Conan is one of the major reasons I started doing stand up
Best. Episode. Ever.
I love this man.
DJ Khaled watching this and ready for his second shot.
I was so relieved when conan bought his own doctor cause I was sure he was going to need one but when José walked in I knew I was a fool to expect him to take his health seriously in the name of comedy.
Where are these all of a sudden fans of Conan coming from? 😂
Does anyone know the brand of the denim jacket Conan is wearing?
Lisan al Ghaib
Cuando lo tomo directo a Da' bomb fue increíble 😮 🇲🇽
Season 23? Crazy how time flies. Can't believe it's already been over two decades. Then again, it has been a while since Sean's long and luxurious mullet years.
My face hurt.  Conan is too funny 😂
conans a weapon, love that man.
The absolute best episode!!!!!
Man Conan is such a great entertainer. Comedy gold here
Call the wife!!!!  Best hot ones ever
I have never really followed Conan.  Late night wasn’t my go to in the 90s like many.  The hot ones is also not something I regularly follow.  I see a video here or there.  This episode came up in a comment and so I went looking.    1) Conan went from someone I didn’t really know, to ranked with comedians like Robin Williams.    2) the interviewer (Sean?) is absolutely one of the best.  He took a completely unhinged comedian and just went with it and yet controlled everything the entire time.    There was no one that could control Robin Williams during an interview,  it was immediately his show. I’m not sure that would have been the case with this guy.    Absolutely great show.  Now I have to spend money on “Max” because the other name was so popular and watch Conan’s travel show.  I will also have to add hot ones to the list.  This was great “tv”.
Legend PERIOD
Conan is going regret life on the toilet later... 😂😂😂
Conana is the king
Absolutely unhinged. Psychotic. Peak Conan.
😭😭😭 bravo bravo bravo 👏
conan o'brien is my hero and idol. thank you so much for this.
Confirmed. Losing the Tonight Show started Conan on a slow descent into madness.
No question, best episode period
This interview had me screaming in laughter. Such an awesome interview overall. Although I always loved Conan’s late night show, I think we can all agree we just love Conan. Period. The end.
Best episode yet.
Conan: "You're not a doctor, are you?" Doc(?): "I should be." Perfect answer!
best hot ones ever
Has Trevor Noah been on the show?...
The drool at the end😂😂
Conan is the king 👑
I haven't felt so many emotions watching a Hot Ones episode until now.
this is the best hot ones episode ever I think.....ive never laughed so hard from beginning to end on any episode. what a performance
I got so much joy watching this…Thank you Hot Ones 🙂
We must protect Conan O'Brien at all costs.
Conan is the best😂
BEST GUEST EVER
Dr.arroyo is the same dermatologist that conan brought to Australia in the life guard remote 🤣🤣?
This is without a doubt the Very Best Episode Ever!!!...okay tied with Bobby lee Episode....but very very awesome  Thank You!!!❤❤❤❤
I love Conan. I can't help but admire his dedication to the bit despite what must been overwhelming heat, such a class act. I'd love to see Craig Ferguson do this, but only if he could be lured out of retirement.
Incredible. I didnt expect it to be so chaotic
With a pocket full of half eaten wings, Conan has climbed to the very top of Hot Ones glory!!!
This man came prepared, he even brought human props! Amazing interview
The most unexpectedly epic performance of hot wing eating by Conan. What an incredible insane man 😂 the best 😅
Conan Fantastic, Fantastic!!!
Hilarious 😂
sean. this was funny asf, thanks for getting the interview lol.
He was probably  the best gest .
Legendary Appearance!
That’s was the best ever, how wild is Conan
Conan is truly one of the great's. Never ceases to make me laugh
My favorite 🙌🏽🧡
Who knew Conan would be the GOAT of this series??
This is only one of 3 Hot Ones videos that i watched every second of and rewinded it to listen to it all over again
Goat
My 2 favorite host/interviews
THIS is hands down the best episode of Hot Ones, hahahaha
I love Conan 😂 Don’t rub your eyes !!!
FINALLY 😂😂🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉   And I don’t regret this show, that was absolutely unexpected, what a roller coaster
Absolute Legend. Long live Conan
Did I just watch the best episode of hot ones
This is the funniest thing I've seen all year!!!! 😂
Conan is Amazing⚡️
There is never a dull moment with Conan and I love it.
Ha! At 18:00 or so Conan talks about having Nixon on to make fun of, I remember we put on Elvis, Hound Dog song during a Nixon speech, turned TV down and the lip sink was spot on, hilarious 😂
Conan tries to play coi but he is so with the culture. Listening his podcast he’s def still in touch with all things going on
This is by far my favorite episode. I laughed through the entire video
This is by far the best episode of Hot Ones I've ever watched. It will also probably be the last one unfortunately 😂
What an absolute UNIT.
Disgusting!
Crazy how much more people wanted to see Conan do this over Shakira. But we know Conan is a master of convo
This will go down as arguably the best hot ones ever.
I swear Dr. Arroyo reminds me of the lawyer or another character from Scrubs lol
Not that he gave you much of a chance, but the man was a golden era Simpsons writer, would have loved to hear more about that. I was hoping he would break into the Monorail song in his wing-induced psychosis.
No one asked, but I have Conan with Letterman and Carson as the best talk show hosts of all time. He’s goated.
What in the world?! 😂 I miss Conan on late night TV.
Best idea was having Conan on
This was the best episode ever...by an Alpha male.
Over 3 mil in 1 day... thems Conan numbers
This was like watching Vince Carter dismantling the 2000 slam dunk competition.  No one will ever be as good as Conan was on this show. I think he ended Hot Ones. It’s over. The absolute GOAT.
Conan is King 👑
This was all timer! Conan! Conan! Conan! 🎉🎉🎉
Ok. I just got done watching this for a 3rd time. Wow this brought me back to high school. I was just reminded of why my friends and I never missed a SNL or a Conan. Bravo Conan! His answers to each questions were encyclopedic and his improv was Steve Martin level
Humans with red hair have a higher tolerance for pain. Wish there would’ve been some questions about Conan and his music.
Asking if he can keep the wing every time is peak
I love this man so much! 👏🙌❤️
this channel not like complete yet. Lets bring female youtuber eater. please invite Tzuyang and Leah Shutkever.
I don't fear your wings man.  Wing drop!
If you didn’t lookup Conan water Buffalo, do that. Won’t regret it
Happy early birthday Conan!
if conan o’brien has a million fans, then i am one of them.  if conan o’brien has ten fans, then i am one of them.  if conan o’brien has one fan, then that fan is me.  if conan o’brien has no fans, then i must be dead.
That. Was. Amazing!
The Popeye quote got me in tears 😆🤣🥹18:31 thank you for recording and sharing this masterclass episode 👏🏾✨🫶🏽
This was epic. The man is a legend
Epic!
The greatest showman on earth
Greatest episode ever!!!!
Hail Hail the King 👑🌶️
Conan is the best late night host hands down
Conan is a beast
Conan trying to hold it together at the end had me rolling and the whole bit came together perfectly!!
Wow! Just wow, great episode!
Everyone needs a Dr. Arroyo
Best...guest...EVER!!!!!
God bless Conan❤❤❤
Anyone else yelling please stop!
Dr. Arroyo might be the doctor that asked Norm MacDonald to open his mouth and say “oink”. He’s not a good doctor.
Wow what an episode 😂🎉
Best hot ones yet!
Chaucer's Tales are actually kinda funny xD
i'm completely lost for words. conan is a genius. couldn't stop laughing
Legendary!
Sean usually tries to mirror his guest's hot sauce consumption but this is the first time I've seen him be like....Nope.  🤣Conan had me laughing tears. He is the physical manifestation of "Funny or Die". I can't even imagine what that following morning must have been like. Ouch.
Best guest ever 🍾🥂
If you had told me yesterday that I'd be watching Conan "spaderbating" with hot sauce, I don't think I would have believed you.
Your toilet hates you.
"Doctor Aroyo" should be a recurring character.
I clapped, too! 😂😂😂
Conan stands alone! Unparalleled funny and genuine guy.
I can’t look at his mouth with food flying everywhere 🤢
goat.
Funniest thing I've seen in ages! Loved it!
I love Conan he's such a gem!
This is the most unhinged Conan video ive seen.
We love COCO. Always 110%. He is honestly one of the best! From Melbourne, Australia.
Was hoping the wings in the jacket would make a comeback like Chekov's gun, but Conan completely didn't fire it lol!
FUNNIEST ep no doubt.
Sean was not ready for Conan 😆😆😆😆😆
Love you Conan!! You’re a legend!!
Old school improv I love it😂❤
Growing up. My parents were so into late night talk shows but it was difficult for me to get into it. It seemed fake, not funny, had lame interviews. But the first time I walked out and saw Conan doing a segment with Gordon Ramsay, I was crying laughing. Conan was always my favorite and he is an absolute legend. I would never miss an episode from that day forward. I am so looking forward to his travel show. I love the humor and how he engages with different environments and cultures. This was a great episode :)
Conan would make such a great Joker.
Conan's wild in this one for hot ones
Is it just me or Sean looking a little blazed 😏
Never watched a single episode of this show, but knowing how insane Conan is I had to watch this one.
He's always been the goat. Somehow got me in tears watching hot ones 😂. Next they gotta interview that one actor from that famous movie. I forgot his name, but there was talk of gerbils.
Now that's how it's done!!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂 That's was awesome!!!!.🤔😉😆😆😆🫶😎😎😎😎
Brand new episode yet classic at the same time!  Well Done Sean and team!  Exceptional interview as well,  Conan’s sincerity in the answers was cool!
I think this is the first time I heard him say a curse word
That Dr. Arroyo was a GD riot! 😂🤣😂
Dude... Conan is da man. Took that like a champ.
The 🐐 of late night.
Easily the best guest ever.
Only guest to truly make da-bomb take an L.
Best. Episode. Ever.
Best episode of all time! What a legend! The rant at the end was fantastic 😂
So good. Loved this episode
Sean didnt dare "Match" his guest on this one. 😂  STANDING OVATION FOR CONAN 🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is the best interview Sean has had to date!
This is THE best hot ones episode
He called the doctor over to take the chicken wing bones. 😂😂😂
Amazing
Absolute F’ING LEGEND! Conan just gets it, and he absolutely came prepared to this to do it like nobody else! Soo entertaining! Maybe the best episode ever!
Involution right there
conan telling us to read the bible after torturing himself is classic!!
Conan has been a long-standing staple in my mental health diet and has had me in stitches countless times. To see him double down and pour his passion into this show had me dying. For the longest time dave grohl was my all-time favorite guest until now. When conan went off on his capsaicin fever soliloquy talking about the many different places you can find humor, you could tell that it wasn't just some thought he conjured out of thin air but more a recital of what he holds close and true in his heart as if he dipped into the soul of his comedic genius and approach and maybe shared some key inspiration wells he draws from  for all to hear, it drew me in closer to see how he could go from silly snarky comedy to throwing something so deep and profound out at the next turn.. It's always a good time when conan is on the screen.
Conan is the best. I used to stay up to watch his show every night when I was in high school and junior high.
Old fans know this is classic Conan and can feel a type a way that he’s just the same as always and new fans can see what a legend Conan is this is basically the level of funny he brings every single time
18:30 in I wanted him to say “this isn’t going good, is it?” just to spite Conan. ;)
I’m gonna be that guy. I thought this was just way too much and over the top.
That was crazy
One day ago and this video already has 3M views. Conan is brilliant and funny,  there will be no other like him... ❤
man this guy is great i loved this episode
I love Conan
I have found a new respect for Conan. Absolutely amazing
We all knew Conan is the greatest host but this show shows he is also a great guest.
Literally the best episode I've ever seen 😂👍👍👍👍👍👍
Was expecting him to run into the desert screaming and get sent by a talking fox to find his soul mate
I like how he intentionally doesn't mention Jay Leno when mentioning late night. It's like in his mind that guy doesn't exist and if he doesn't his name don't matter. also Conan is legendary! Even if he took this serious it'd be amazing because it's Conan.
Someone call the wife! LOL
Conan is a Legend
I’ve watched hot ones since the beginning, new favorite episode ever.
Classic comedian ❤ love it
Honestly, have given Conan chance after chance and just have never been a huge fan of his, but this might’ve sold me on Conan!
Exceeded all of my expectations 👍 Conan is just an amazing entertainer.
It is official, this is the first Hot Ones episode I have seen reactions spawn from. 3 reaction channels so far have watched the whole episode. Conan is amazing in this, as he is in most things.
Conan will go down in history as one of the best comedians ever.
To quote my hero, Popeye, "I yam what I yam."
Epic showmanship
The ending was disgusting! 🤮
You should get Mike Mitchell and Nick Wiger from Doughboys on next season.
"Are you a real doctor?"  "I should be."
Conan is slowly becoming a wax sculpture of himself.
Conan just gets it.
Water Buffalo: Black Death.
Probably the best episode of hot ones
This is going to be a hard episode to top.
Why is no one talking abiut conan pocketing the wings? 😂
Conan just won Hot Ones!  He gets it.  Unbelievable when he starts dousing (not dabbing) each wing half way through!  Good luck Sean topping that one.
conan is and will forever be a legend😂😂🐐🐐🙌🙌
Hasan piker needs to get on the show.
Best one yet! It’s going to be hard to top.
Conan, the Scoville Barbarian.
LOL at 12:50 he is wearing the same jacket
I love Conan, but that’s too much make up
DUDE! This was the best!
I love Conan and this was great but I really couldn't handle that he didn't wipe his mouth. It was gross.
This was awesome! Thank you!
First We Feast  - PLEASE make Conan the youtube header on your homepage
"I'M FINE! I'M PERFECTLY FINE!!!!" 😂😂🤣🤣
Ok, that's the best episode *EVER*
The doctor trying to listen to the pulse with his ear with his hands around Conan’s neck, just had me rolling 😂😂😂
Conan makes me happy
This episode was incredible
Who's the Dr, he was hilarious
One of the best episodes EVER! What a personality!
Conan telling Sean he’s an awesome interviewer has gotta be great.
Conan > Jimmy Fallon
My new favorite
Peak Comedy
Conan is a boss
Jay who? Im gonna say it, Conan is the best of all...better than Berle, Allen, Carson, Rivers & Letterman. And he's likeable!!!
WOW best episode ever, best guest of all time, no surprise there, Conan is da best, talk to y'all later!
Can’t believe Sean was dating an active p0rnstar lol
The takeoff was uneventful but the landing was catastrophic.  At least he died doing what he loved.
Conan eats like a messy toddler lol
I wonder if the chicken is all cold and gross or if it's any good.
Wing drop! 🍗💥
This was absolutely the best one for me. Had me dying!!!!! I've been watching this show since day 1
That was a ride!
I've never seen somebody going more wild than Steve-O, yeah dude!
Conan is an absolute legend
Conan is the best!!!! I couldn’t stop laughing!!!!!
fire the make up artist
Best guest ever
cool vid
funniest hot ones interview
Conan had the most unhinged episode to date and I wouldn’t have expected anything less from him.
RIP Conan
I knew Conan was crazy funny but I did not know he was a spiced wing psychopath 😅
Conan is really a showman. What a episode
He Unironically did the best by far of any guest. I mean dude was just smothering them with sauce
Sean is so scared😂😂😂😂
Gotta shout out that animated water buffalo story! Fantastic!
Conan for President! He is the best hahaha
One of the best episodes ever :)
no more explain that gram? I really liked that segment
I can't get over that he did a shot of the Last Dab 😅😅😅😅 what a savage
Howard Stern was right, Conan is always the best interview guest, no matter what show
That is an entertainer! This was gold!
Conan is by far the best guest Sean has ever had! Conan is the GOAT!
Conan confirming the study that people with red hair may be less susceptible to spicy foods. 🔥
David Byrne next
🤣👏
You gotta crown Conan the King of Hot Ones.
Wow..he committed, and might need to be committed. Brilliant
This is my new favorite episode
I have been a fan for ages and have had the opportunity to meet him a couple of times. He is the nicest guy and loves his fans. Truly the king of late night comedy and of the best comedians of our generation.
I’ve tried the whole line of sauces, and Conan is a Beast for going that heavy on any sauce past “The Bomb”. The bomb is actually an incredibly flavorful sauce that delivers its heat evenly and isn’t so hot that it ruins the flavor of food, beyond that I would not do more than a dab.😂😅
Conan is an absolute legend!
Leave Conan O'Brien alone, he's perfectly f***ing fine!!!
23:00 No, Conan, you are not f*cking fine...
Wow, never been a huge Conan O'Brien fan but I am impressed!
This is so inspirational
Out of all the people the whitest red head we all know handles the wings of death like a loving legend. Never in a million years would I had guess he would have handles the sauces like that.
RIP to Conan's b-hole after this taping.  Gonna have to stand for the podcast for the next month 😂.    Good god, he's insane with that hot sauce-- but the man's dedication to his craft is incredibly fun to watch.  Long live Conan O'Brien.
THE GOAT
He definitely threw up?
That was absolutely insane. Conan was amazing. I cannot believe those sauces barely phased him. Amazing. ✌🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Best. Episode. EVER! Conan👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🤣
Well… good luck topping that. Conan all time great!
Did Conan turn into Jim Carey at some point here?? lol
Best guest EVER!!! 😂😂😂
You know people save their money to travel when they retire? That is HBO for Conan + benefits :)
His descent into a Ren n Stimpy character. It’s beautiful.
Mad Magazine is funny
Conan is one of the GOATS of Entertainment. Only talk show host to this day, that kept his audience and guy gets funnier everyday. Couldn't stop laughing out loud in the office. Thank you Conan and Sean for this episode!
This was incredible 😂😂😂😂
You know he just feels things different. When someone is high strung like this is entertainment at it finest believe me.
Sean, we need an update on Conan.  Being a hot sauce lover, that night and day two must have been a complete nightmare.  Hopefully his schedule allowed for purging.  What do you know, and how bad was it?
I’m in love with Conan!
Conan just reminded everyone why he’s one of the goats in comedy. Dude is a class act.
After this Conan's masterpiece, I really think we also need to see Jim Carrey on this show.
16:46 Conan, you mad man!
This was insane. He's such a good dude and incredible about flipping between serious / silly. Also I want his jacket.
This is a manic episode and amazing
I really needed a good laugh and this gave me that’s nd so much more😂❤
This is my third time watching this and it still makes me cry from laughter
I need the Sean cut seeing if he’s actually matching what Conan is doing! No other guest has made me question if Sean is actually matching them haha
I'd have to say, this is the episode I've been waiting for.... after all the years of watching, nobody has done it. Conan did it.... I laughed, and in the end, applauded. This episode can't possibly be topped.
I love Conan. Hands down the GOAT. Always entertaining, always sharp. 🎉
i highly doubt there will ever be an ep of hot ones as funny as this one
This is brilliant hahahaha
all i'm waiting for from this one is how would conan review sean's questions
this is the hardest I've laughed in while bravo 😂😂😂!!!!
oh my gosh I'm CRYING 😂😂😂😂 i love you conan!
Got I love that man
Hahhahahaha i 💔 Conan! 🤣😂
I knew it when I saw Conan that this would be a memorable episode.   By far top hot ones guest of all time.  And top 2 late night hosts or all time.
By far my favourite episode, because it’s one of my favourite people on earth.
this was amazing. actually laughed out loud
Love this guy. Watched him since I was a teen. 86 years young now.  But, that's not important. How fire is the jacket he is wearing. Oh, the wing eatin show is fun. He is my favorite, seriously. So funny. Dry, unrealistic, like a great uncle who talks about cemeteries he's visited. Favorite episode ever. Favorite.
Took it like a champ ❤️
Legendary status attained! Hail to the king.
Lol he dubbed da bomb!
I love him so much
Dude is this guy immune?!?!
10/10
this was funny af lol
amazing the best i have seen wow
INNNSSSSSSSSSSSAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
The pandemic has been over for years. BRING BACK THE SINGLE TABLE SET. FFS they’re sitting miles away from one another.
Best Episode EVER!!!!
Conan is GOATED
My favorite episode for sure
Conan always brings the heat.
that has to be the best episode ever!
Definitely my favorite hot ones
Best one yet
CONAN!!!!!! Incredible 💥💥💥💥💥💥
Conan is just the absolute goat, he even has Sean shook on his own show, which is rare. He dominated this interview
How is Conan O' Brian being more Eric Andre than Eric Andre himself?
Best show of all time💯
Just when I thought he could feel no pain.....
Conan made Steve-O look sane.
This is straight up an instant classic, im fuggin dyin😂😂
The GOAT, hands down. No one will ever "out Hot Ones" Hot Ones like O'Brien did. Masterful.
Moment of silence for Conan's other end
conan obrien is an absolute treasure
That was the greatest episode of all time and I've been watching ya from the start haha good on ya Conan you were incredible haha
Conan!  u are awesome!  I luv u! best episode ever!
My god. I mean, unhinged doesn’t begin to describe it…. Beyond courage!
Loved this episode! Conan is the man!
This is the single funniest episode of Hot Ones ever!
MADNESS! 😂 21:04
I love this so much
best episode ever
This is the best episode...love Conan.
The BEST episode ever! 😂😂😂 Glad to see Conan do it! Absolutely love him & his fake doctor!😂😂😂
Can it get any better? The answer is Conan again.
LEGEND.
I had to look away. Conan is desperately insane / insanely desperate in this. To a disgusting degree. Like, on a Tom Green level. Yet, somehow I’m a fan.
For a moment there I was scared for conan I thought he was gonna drink straight from that bottle of DaBomb. 😂😂😂
Even I clapped.
Sean constantly cracking up from laughter is so good. 100/10 episode
This is the best interview ever. Conan is and will always be the late night GOAT, and now he is so much better.
This was my FAVOURITE hot wings!!!!!
Conan might be the greatest guest ever.
“What’s wrong with me, why can’t I feel?!” Meeeeee  😂 22:32
Wow! Instant classic and best ever. Need a behind the scenes on this one and respect to him for actually eating the dawn wings. Love it.
Legendary 🔥 lol
That was the best episode
I’d love to see an update about 2 hours after the last wing.
Legendary, there was barely room for any interview. He just devoured the "hot" ones
Who would’ve thought Conan would show more toughness on these than Ramsey 😂
Conan has more testicular fortitude than anyone that’s ever been on this show. He has set the bar high!!!
He’s da man.
This is up there with when the late Coolio chugged a bottle of hot sauce and was passed out
Yeah I think Gordon Ramsey has some competition here
Conan just ascended to the #1 spot in the Hot Ones pantheon.  ...do feel bad for Sean, that was impossible to keep up with.
Best episode ever!
Sorry but it's rigged. All of the sauces that he pours on the wings are almost liquid, but these are actually thick sauces. They've been tampered with.
“You’re not a doctor are you?” “I should be.”
Conan O’Brien is a national treasure
Conan is the best!!
Oh man, this was supposed to be funny? I am sorry I must be getting old
Conan's a beast! 😆
“I don’t know what the other guy was doing.”  Cold
This hot ones episode changed my life.
…..patiently waiting for an update stating that this was an April fools joke and the sauces were all actually tomato sauce….
So this is Conan the character, not Conan the person. I appreciate his comedic dedication.
His commitment to the bit is so laser focused he literally blocks out pain that you know he is feeling just to not break the bit. It's like Leo slicing his hand in Django but keeps acting or cruise breaking ankle but keeps running. A rare breed. I could see a mugger stabbing him and him going " oh he's stabbing , Mr mcstabber is stabbing me wah wah" then camera turns off and he collapses dead
Harvard Graduate wrote for the Simpsons during its peak and wrote for SNL during a great run, took over for Letterman on The Late Show on NBC, and worked his way into (and deserved) The Tonight Show. Went on tour, Rockabilly playing. Came back to TBS, podcaster, I'm missing so many...the guy is a treasure. Might be the best episode
He's the GOAT. 16:45 just cements it in history
This was an inspirational performance
“These aren’t the rantings of someone who’s had some bad chemicals!!!”
Arguably the best episode in the run of the show! Incredible!!
That was so funny!!
This is might be the best episode ever in the context that Conan simultaneously never gave up the bit going so hard maybe the hardest anyone has for Hot Ones and actually gave some thoughtful answers. So much fun to watch. To me he has only gotten better in his age and his comedy. He deserves the Mark Twain Award in my opinion.
Great episode but you might want to call him every few hours to see if he is alive! Hats off to you both. Conan can't wait to check the new show out..
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!
Excellent EXCELLENT episode. Conan is an absolute beast. The questions (and in this case the subsequent answers) were superb as always. So glad Sean got interview props from Conan. He is exactly right. Game recognize game.   After the ice spice episode, I called for the termination of whoever does casting 😂 but I take it all back
Conan is the funniest guest this show has ever seen. Hahaha. He is still a comic genius!
Conan love you man ! Your a beast!
Ginger’s have a higher pain tolerance than people with other hair colors
CONAN OH MY GOD!!!!!!!
Really amazing episode. 2 of my favorite hosts in one show . Conan went he hard😅
That's the hardest I've laughed in a long time.  Thank you Conan 😂
He definitely lost his filters. This is like when Homer ate the hot sauce and started hallucinating
GROSS!!!  LOL  looking forward to watching Conan's new show❤
Conan is a machine!
Conan is a G
Conan is a national treasure.
I’ve been watching Hot Ones for years and kinda fell out of watching this season but when this episode popped up, I couldn’t get here fast enough. Conan is an absolute legend and this episode was amazing! What a win for Hot Ones!
Conan is officially a giga Chad. Now can they get Andy Richter.
My toddler borfed all night. I wasn't ready to watch this.
Last dab?? He soaked his.....
😂😂
Wow That was very entertaining 😅
Ngl that was disgusting.
That was awesome
This interview is insane. Conan’s unique chaotic comedic energy is uncontainable
conan is the goat
I’m so glad this video is doing well. All my fellow Conan lovers know what’s up lol
A great interviewer meets a master. At the same time, every redhead I know can handle spice.
conan always gotta be in control
That was Nicolas cage dressed as Conan Obrien
Best hot ones ever
Nit a huge Conan watcher, but that was epic.  Seeing this makes me wish was could have seen Chris Farley do a round with the wings.
"If you can read, read widely, and read well" - Conan O'Brien
I don’t think an episode made me laugh harder. Bravo Sean and Bravo to the magnificent King of Comedy, Mr. Conan O’Brien. Thank you!
Conan is great and crazy all rolled up in 1
My first thought was also Harding.
Best guest ever?
Love Conan, what a god. He's freaking hilarious and can be informative at the same time.
Oh my God! Conan is a fcking animal!  And I'm here for it!
Conan was on fire before he even started eating. Best episode ever.
This was my favorite episode ever.
Sean is known for matching the guests energy but Conan is unmatchable. What an episode!
Just in case there was any doubt that Conan is the 🐐
This was the best one yet
Well Sean, you've set the bar pretty high for next season.  Good luck topping this one buddy.
I have never laughed so hard watching one of these. Conan never disappoints. A true comedy legend, always. Also, please bring on Jordan Schlansky next and I could die happy.
Props to Conor on this. I feel like he pulled out all the stops to support a young interviewer he likes. He knows his performance will crush in views. Respect
The visits from *Uncle Bernie must be epic.  *Bernie Schitz
BEST EPISODE EVER.  Sean always has amazing questions and kept up with Conans energy. I wish he would have asked if Jordan Schlansky would be in one of the upcoming max episodes. They would be hilarious together. Such a great interview overall though.
Absolutely one of my favorite episodes! I never laughed so hard 😂😂😂
Legendary.
Harrowing animal…water buffalo..  Waiting……..  Thank you for this show. Love what you do and how your disarm….
Someone has to go check on Conan and make sure he’s still alive. Unlike the president who couldn’t even handle lobster. Epic, unhinged, but epic. Conan can take on a water buffalo and the wing gauntlet!
At EXACTLY 22:53 You can see Sean's face show genuine heavy concern for Conan. Whether its for his physical health or his mental health after everything he just did😂🤣 Best Episode Yet.
This was absolutely fantastic. 😂😂😂 Conan is a beast. There has to be 10,000 memes in this one
The audience needs to demand a follow up. Did he die?
He’ll be dead in 4 years tops.
Conan is utterly and completely bonkers in absolutely the best way.  I was laughing that kind of laugh that almost scares you because you can't take a breath.  They've had some fantastic guests on this show, but this episode was already my favorite before it was even half over.  Conan is right up there with Rowan Atkinson and the late Robin Williams when it comes to raw natural talent at the drop of a hat... or wing.
Conan is a crazy man, and I love it
I’m roaring laughing  Who knew this is one of the funniest dudes ever
Best episode ever.
I was not.  Prepared.    Conan forever. 🤣
Conan is, and always has been, the man. Also, that’s a really nice denim jacket.       Edit: this is the best episode by far. I’ve seen them all from the very beginning. Conan is the best guest and rocks the entire show.       Team.      Coco.
All the respect, .... man I hope you read this. YOU just put Shaquille o Squeal in his place, you murdered you murderer, If I can ever see you live, I will.
Conan is just a powerhouse
Conan is my most favorite person I’ve never met! So pumped for this
FKN LOVE YOU CONAN
Sean is a bald younger Conan clone
Conan's Irish-Catholic is so apparent in this interview
Dude this man’s crazy
Now we need a hot sauce named "Conan's Hair Sauce"
a real Irishman
Not the best of all time, THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME CONAN!!!!!
I think Conan might be a crazy person
Top 5 best episodes of all time. Conan wins at everything. ❤️❤️❤️❤️🤟
Joe budden is looking real bad right now
Best episode ever !!!! ❤❤❤
Love Conan
Probably the best one I’ve watched!! Brilliant from start to finish.
conan is a HORRIBLE person. AND, this episode is COMPLETELY fake.
"That's not what showbusiness is about. Showbusiness is about putting on the greatest show in the world" is honestly an incredible quote. Especially given by a man who is dousing himself in hot sauce whilse saying it, just to entertain people.
Reminds me of the Shaq episode
Hot Ones GOAT Episode!!!
This is one of the best things I’ve ever seen  Ever
Been my doctor for 25 years.... where did you go to medical school.... 1998.... so you went to medical school for a day
Conan is not afraid of the heat... the heat is afraid of Conan 🤯
Man Conan brought his A game to this one. So freakin funny. Boss.
Your best episode. Period.
How does a show have only great episodes, only to be topped by the greatest. True platinum!
All timer! 💯
OH my God Did we all deserve it? I highly doubt but I enjoyed every second
After he talked about Leno, I was thinking it’dbe awesome to get Leno on Hot Ones!… He could get his face burnt off twice.
The greatest episode ever. By the end when Conan takes over. Anyone know how Conan's toilet is doing?
conan o brian you will forever be my spirit animal
Who had "Conan sauces his nips" on their BINGO card?
thats crazy shaun, didn't you say to shakira she was the season closer?
at the end, conan turns into a mad screaming red faced colonel sanders 🍗 or that burl ives snowman⛄from that 1950s rudolf the red nosed reindeer movie with that milk beard. brilliant points about comedy! stuff that made folks laugh and soil their pants throughout humanity...
This is the most UNHINGED episode of all time hahahahaha
Coco is a living legend!
the best hot ones i have watched in a loooong time, absolute legend
Easily the best episode yet.
Honestly, if this doesnt make you want to live and embrace life in all its chaos and beauty, im not sure what will. Might have to record this and pass it on to my non existent children.   Somehow left this episode with more motivation and zest for life. Absolutely amazing. Thanks Hot Ones, and Conan.
I hope this gets the most views, my favorite by a long shot🔥🔥🔥
Great Show!! Genius!! 😆😆😆
7:36 Sean deserves all the praise he gets in these episodes.
Conan is the GOAT!!
Thank you, Conan has always been my favourite late night host and one of my favourite celebrities in general.
this episode has absolutely entered the ranks of my all time favorites
OMFG this was immediately LEGENDARY!! CONAN! CONAN! CONAN! CONAN! CONAN! CONAN! CONAN! CONAN! CONAN! CONAN!
I’ve watched a number of Hot Ones episodes back to back.  That number is 1.  Thanks for all the fish, Conan.
Needs more Jordan Schlansky
Conan is the absolute best!! I'm so excited for his new show, i'll be tuning in for sure!
NO WAY NO WAY NO WAY
23:52 okay but he's so right. I picked up Don Quixote expecting a novel about knights and got one of the funniest stories I've read in ages
Wow,
Whatever they were expecting Conan to do, it wasn't this.
Conan has always been my favorite host ever, he's so funny and nice and smart. ❤
Legend!
I came here for a Coco meltdown and got a Evans meltdown. 10/10
Anyone who hosts Conan ends up having that be one of their, if not the, best episodes. Dude is always a riot; pure madness.
Loved this so much
That bit about show business really hit me in the chest. Sometimes at events/weddings everything goes wrong but if you stick it out and pull through for your clients it can still one of the best nights ever.
Sean always talking about he on the same page LOL..., Not his page your not
This is the most unhinged episode ever, and im here for it 😅
Conan is the best! lol
Nice!
GOAT
Used to have a huge crush on Conan...he reminds me of Danny Kaye ❤️
From talk show host legend to a hot ones/hot wing legend? Conan truly is a barbarian!! Look at him go!!
Conan is the greatest
Conan is a legend 😂😂
Clown
CONAN LOL
Did Dr. Arroyo go to Hollywood Upstairs Medical college?
Legend.
Anyone else think that Sean didn’t warn Conan about being careful around his eyes because he knew if he mentioned it, the first thing Conan would do is pour hot sauce directly into them? 😂😂😂Conan was brilliant. I’ve watched this a dozen times and it makes me laugh harder each time. This was a master class in comedy and professionalism. Team coco for life.
Best episode so far
Hats off to a top comedic performance by Conan!  True dedication to the craft! Wow his tolerance was totally unexpectedly!  Instant classic!
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GIVE HIM THE AWARD FOR TOUGHEST GUEST
the goat of snl?
Thank you Conan for the greatest episode of Hot Ones ever!
I’m not sure I believe that it is real hot sauce that he is using???? 🥵🥵🥵🥵
If anyone sees this, God is real and He loves you, He will bring you good luck and show you the way! ♥♥♥
Oh my what a guy his intestines were quite literally turning into acid and he somehow was able to speak with not even a stumble or a stutter.. a legend if I’ve ever seen one. Love this man
Conan turned orange and was drooling at the end. 😂 I have to watch this again 😂😂
Best episode yet!
Conan is a MF beast!!!
Tell me capsaicin doesn’t get you high…
One word, REDHEAD.
Truly the guest we've all been waiting for
It's putting the wings in his pocket and asking permission first😂 for me💀🤣 classic Conan!!!!
This cannot be topped. Conan is the goat.
at this point Sean should interview nardwar so they can out-research each other
Best episode ever! I cried laughing!
Why do i feel like i can run through a brick wall
Aaaand this is my favourite episode, now waiting for Conan O'Brien And Aubrey Plaza hot wings challenge lol
Best episode ever
GOAT of the Hot Ones by far
We have the same birth date
This is simply a brilliant episode. Conan knows how to bring it.
16:45 Conan did that with DA BOMB?! I bought a bottle of that in 2019 and still have 94% left
Real comedy is Easy. Commit to the bit.
That was amazing. Thank you.
Conan and Craig Ferguson are truly the GOATS of the last few decades.  Not only funny and talented but good people...
Conan Pro, r
This was so disappointing.  Not funny smearing hot sauce all over?! We could finish it. The last step would have gone for the eye or down his pants. 🙁
😂😂😂😂😂😂 the bomb!!!!!
Awesome episode!!!
This is fucken awesome
knocked it out of the park, puts DJ Khal-cuck to shame
great one!!
This definitely rivals the Stone Cold episode as my favourite of all time
Love how sean loses it half way through the interview and can barely keep it together for most of it because Conan just comepletely lets loose xD
I love Conan! ❤ He is the best!!!
Conan is the G.O.A.T 😂😂😂
Conan is a beast!!! I also think he may have covid and doesn’t have any taste buds..😂 I love it!!!
the last bit actually made me cry a lil
I’ve been watching Hot Ones for years and this may be my new favorite episode.  Conan NEVER disappoints😂😂😂😮😮😮😮😮
This is the BEST episode of hots ones I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂
It’s always the da bomb that gets everyone.
UNHINGED
I have sore eyes but will suffer through it just to see Conan eating hot wings.
Best episode ever!!! Love Conan, never get tired of him
CONAN!!!!
Best episode in years
What in the world did I just watch? Did that really happen?
Conan got burned on Tonight show gig  it was moving to LA  east Coast better/  New York/ Rules  i mean  Kimball us great but Fallon knocks it on  humor.
The best one ever! It used to be Russell Brand. Invite him back and see if he can top it
that hockey stick was a lefty and Bill is clearly a righty so who owns that stick?
This was the best episode ive seen . Conan is friggin hilarious
“Call the wife” 🫡 💀💀💀 I’ve watched this entire thing 5 times, Conan is the greatest of all time, god tier
This must be one of the greatest hot one episodes ever. I don't even knew too much about Conan O'Brian, but boy he did deliver a great show
I always loved Conan. I used to look forward to the PSAs they'd do on the show.  Max Weinberg always had the most provocative PSAs 😂
This is the best episode. ever.
this dude cringe
Holy legendary
This is both hilarious and horrifying.
I think we need Colbert and Stewart on Truth or Dab
Great episode. Maybe the best one yet. But please drop the backround music.
Best MF episode ever. Bravo 👏
I want to see more of what Sean did to match him during this lol! Did he also pour as much and drink from the bottle?! 😂
Best ever!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
One of the greatest Hot Ones episodes ever. Conan is a true gem of entertainment.
Okay the 5th time watching, it gets funnier and funnier. CLASSIC!!
What a boss. Total legend. Two amazing interviewers in one room!
👑
I give him about 4 years..
Conan you are THE MAN.  Thank you for the laughter you bring into my day on the regular.  You are impossibly talented, smart and hysterical…in fact, this must be AI CONAN!!!!
Best. Episode.  Ever.
This one's a Hall of Famer.
i look forward to seeing clips of this episode in every compilation, forever. mad man!
.. And now you can invite Jay Leno on to replace Conan.
Gordon Ramsey used to be GOAT on Hot Ones,  Connan is now untouchable 👍🏻
That right there is the funniest human ever to have lived. My favourite human.
Look, I’m not saying Conan is on drugs. But if — like John Mulaney — we learn years from now that he was on drugs during this interview, I won’t be surprised. Either that or the guy is just really funny / can’t take the heat.
Legend.
That Irish tolerance for pain is real
this was amazing
red head really have less senses huh
Conan is the best guest ever... and probably my favorite person! I want to be his friend 😂
This has to be the most iconic hot ones episode in the history of this show. Conan is one of the very few people who can steal the show from Sean Evans in this format. Absolute legend giving a class here in how to put on a performance for the fans
that was the greatest last dab I've ever seen.
This episode is the polar opposite of DJ Khaled haha
This is one of the best videos on YouTube, I've seen hot ones for multiple years and I really think that is the best interview by far. Also it's the first time that Sean could not match the energy of someone.
Conan is an absolute psychopath and I love it.
conan is a god!
Please get Mandy Moore
Comedy lesson from the master
I vote Conan for Mount Rushmore of Hot Ones
21:04 reminds me so much of filthy frank
Hands down the best episode ever. The must unnerving, thought-provoking conversations smothered with unscripted comedy. Conan O'Brien is truly a gem. I want to be as unhinged as he is. I want to have the same energy at 61. He made Sean Evans lose his composure, laughing and crying by the end of the show. That was quite a ride. Fitting for a season finale. Maybe even one of the best moments in Youtube history.
“I love travel, and my mission is that you learn nothing about the country” … can’t wait to see this show.
And that, my friends, is why Conan is a legend.
TOP 3 episode and it’s not 3
Legendary
Oh my god…he feels like a professor in a class I’m not taking….he reminds me robin Williams…and actually made me feel kinda scared for him….but also so happy and it feels inspired……
Can this be real?  IDK. Seems implausible.
Conan is real life morty
GOATED
Conan going full Rick Sanchez rant at the end is awesome!!!
This man is a comedic gem. He went o my High School and we tried in vain to get him to give a graduation speech.
The best episode BY FAR
Best guest ever, legend!!
The peak of this episode is knowing that Conan's goal is 🌠to feel🌠
Conan O'Brien is a beast and "The Man"!! And is probably the best and funniest Hot Ones guest I've ever seen!  😆 🤣 And bravo for the very talented Doctor O'Royal!  👏  I think he saved Conans life a couple of times!  ❤️🙏 And thank you Sean Evans! You are the best host and interviewer ever!!!  😃
Conan is a maniac! 23:00 Ate them like a champ! Very impressed with his performance. Dr was hilarious too.
What a god
Calling Leno “the other guy” is the perfect amount of petty all these years later 🤣
Mf. DRANK. dabomb!!   Conan is truly the GOAT, finally getting max just for the show
Greatest Episode Ever. 🐐
Why did he put wings in his coat 😭
Hmm…. Something tells me hes not a real doctor 👁️👄👁️
First standing ovation on the show.  An exhibition of the art form of clowning.
Can’t believe he ate it! But so funny! 😂
This was amazing
Legendary performance!
Conan is reminding the young comedians how its done here.
Unfortunately, Hot Ones has to end now following Conan O'Brien perfecting the format on today's episode.  This must be the series finale.
Is there an IMDB for internet shows? Because this might top the list of greatest episodes of an internet series ever.
Conan just made history!!! This was absolute GOLD!!!!
Can I keep these😂😂😂😂
Best episode ever!
GREAT interview. Almost better than Space Ghost C2C.
Maybe others have been funnier than Conan, maybe others have been more entertaining, maybe others have had more philosophical answers but none have combined all and thoroughly entertained us for 27 minutes!! GOAT (and I'm a casual Conan fan).
So funny! Was laughing! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Gordon Ramsey, Russel Brand, Tenacious D, Weird Al, Guy Fieri, Paul Rudd, Gwyneth Paltrow's lack of reaction, and all the rest...  I think Conan won
We now have an official scale for guests on Hot Ones. From now on every guest will be placed on the scale somewhere between DJ Khalid and Conan O’Brien. They are the bottom and top most of guest performances and that will never change.
He eat that like he made it wow
Amazing
(Minus that pottymouth) this was the BEST GUEST EVER, I loooooove you CoCo you are the MAN amongst alL men!!!!! 🤩😘🥰
Conan has still got it! Absolute legend. Loved watching him growing up and today he made one of, if not the best hot ones episode. 😂
Best hot ones ever! Conan is awesome! Wow! 👍👍👍
This is the definition of hot sauce high😂
Truly one of the greatest comedic geniuses of all time
I’ve watched Conan before but now i feel how brilliant at show business he is really interesting how well he came across here !
Instant all-time top 10 ep.  At least.  What a legend he is.
He's not unhinged, because theres not even a door.....or a door frame....or a room for the concept of a hinge to exist.
Goated episode
that's an aries if i've ever seen one
i have a deeper respect for conan after watching this episode. great one, guys!
Doubted it at first...  But it turned into funny...  Id love to see conan eat a ghost pepper!
Hardest I've laughed in a long time, thank you Conan 😂😂😂
Laughing to tears. Best show ever.
Oh my god🤣
this dude be cray! hahaha! awesome! i thought ref heads are supposed to be more sensitive to pain? lol
This is peak peak YouTube. I love Conan and hot ones!
100% sure this is the best guest in Hot Ones history.
The greatest hot ones of all time
No one wraps it up better than hot ones
Best episode ive watched yet 😂 love Conan 🧡
Dr. should have said: Hollywood Upstairs Medical College
The absolute EPITOME of Aries energy!! I am deceased!
That whole episode was killing me, that might be the best episode they've done.  Conan is a legend
3M views in 24hrs? We love you Conan!
“On Max. Because HBO was too popular. It just rolls off the tongue ’MAX’” lol, one of the best guests ever, he went all the way and then went back and went all the way again and again.🎉
I want behind the scenes footage more …
Oh my god,,,.cohen defending himself getting on a water buffalo….I love it,…hahahaha,,,   :-)
This episode is the definition of epic 😍🙌🏼
Literally the best episode of this show
This man is out of control
this was very entertaining
Incredible episode!
This has got to be the most entertaining episode of hot ones I’ve ever very seen. Jeeesus bravo Conan O’Brien.
Can't wait for his travel show..
Out of all late night show hosts, he’s truly amazing. He’s actually funny. He actually creates jokes. And doesn’t need to fake laugh *cough* Jimmy *cough*
That's an amazing level of commitment. I have so much respect for this guy.
This is the greatest episode I've seen yet
I love Connan!
Conan is insane. What a guy.
It’s almost unbelievable that Conan is actually as good of a guest as he is a host.
Conan ate
This & Shia are now tied for my all time favourite episode
BEST HOT ONES EPISODE EVER!!!!!!!!!!
Best Hot Ones Yet! 😊
Still love that man
Dabbing and licking Da Bomb will never be out done.  Good Lord!
This was pure, beautiful, unfettered chaos. I loved it.
Imagine Robin Williams on Hot Ones. It would have been unreal.
This was amazing, I got a whole new level of respect for the big COB!😊😊😊
I’d like to see how Conan feels tomorrow.
The release of Conan's travel show is April 18th which coincidentally is also Conan's Birthday. I know this because it's mine too
Conan got  hot sauce high 😂😂😂😂
Conan is channeling big Robin Williams energy at times here & and boy, is it glorious.  Conan is truly the best stateside host of all time.
Ok, this is absolutely the best episode yet. Conan slowly turns into a purple grape while shouting THIS IS NOTHING is pure gold.
They should never make another hot ones episode again this should be the finale
Legend
I love him already and I’m still waiting for the intro ad to finish.
I've never witness someone get pink eye before 😄
Just when I thought it was too much, funny to much, it most definitely too much and it was incredible. Conan, over the top, but beyond insanity good.
I am so pumped for this episode!! Conan is the greatest talk show host of my generation, next to Letterman.
Murderville. He just got real sloppy.
Best one ever........
Protect this man ♡
He is the icon of a magical era of entertainment and television that, unfortunately, is gone for good.   Respect to you Conan. A real comedian and showman.❤
I don't think I ever seen a interview where Conan is being interviewed..lls
Yep, you're done. Conan killed the show.
This is the greatest interview ever done, the most genuine, unhinged, pure and honest. It has change who I am to the core. I love you Conan, you are the greatest comedian and man ever to exist.
The best hot one’s episode ever.
Goat 🐐
Sean’s face 22:39 😂
Conan just makes me laugh!…
Conan is so outlandish that he brought a human as a prop.
The absolute best late night host ever
GIVE THIS GUY A STANDING OVATION
There was a point… no…!!!
Conan the goat 😂
Did he record this in Haiti?
Drinking from the bottle again and again I don't think anyone but Conan could pull this bit and make it so perfect.
I miss this man.
We have reached the zenith. Open your eyes and embrace it
You know what's interesting, Conan said that telling the audience it's not going well is the worst move a guest can make.  Ironically him telling the audience his show was terrible is what saved his early career.  It really wasn't that great, when him and Andy started making fun of themselves it became hilarious.
"Iconic"
He’s showed us why he’s the king 👑
Hilarious
This has to be the wildest and therefore my favorite episode. Conan is such a legend
Best Episode of All Time
Epic
What a performance 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
legend
Best episode ever of one of the best shows ever on the Internet.
After a few year hiatus rom watching FWF on the regular, this brought me back. Glad to see some great things never change.
Conan O’Brien is my absolute life hero. Thank you for decades of laughs you are such a legend.
This very well might be my favorite
How is any guest gonna follow that? Conan destroyed.
"But of course I never listen to Andy." 😂😂
Conan is the GOAT... Da Bomb Dab
So it’s actually a scientific fact that redheads have a super high pain tolerance. I’m not even making that up. Nobody even knows why (yet). Anesthesiologists are even taught this for obvious reasons.
I (stunned) … I just don’t see how any future guest will be able to top this in terms of sheer showmanship and commitment.
How insane is this man, I consider him one of the greatest TV personalities after this....
Conan is #1
Conan is a national treasure. Add him to the list with Keanu Reeves, Bill Murray, and Martha Stewart.
Absolute gold….no platinum….no this was magma from earths core bottled and corked into 27 minutes of perfectly executed talent. Hats off you you both!
Maestro !!
The show's over folks! Hot Ones has peaked.
Conan is a national treasure.  One of the celebrities from the “before-times” that I’m glad is still relevant in the current mess of things
True to his word, Conan made me cry tears! 😂🤣
Conan is the biggest legend ever
Best interviee I have seen in hotones
Release the Water Buffalo footage!!! 😂
Conan’s the best. I don’t understand how in the world people preferred Jay over him. The guy is just funny, and has a singular wit to boot.
Poor Sean nearly having a panic attack when Conan overdoes the Bomb 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This man is an absolute legend.
"I just kept thinking. ...why??" I felt that
This is the reason I've loved Conan right from the first. He does not commit to a bit. He commits to being who he is, and such authenticity is absolutely mesmerizing, fantastically inspiring. BRAVO and KUDOS to everyone making, & making it on, this show
Best one hands down! Bravo Conan! 👏👏👏
How can I give more than (or something superior to) a like? This is the pinnacle of Hot Ones, pure fun and the real divine comedy!
Absolute... Coco... Chaos.  Yet again proving why he's the best.
Conan really the 🐐😂this is my favorite episode ever hands down
Where's seans GF?
Conan is the King of Late Night and the Sauce Boss!
This is amazing... Best one ever?
a compliment from conan =GOLD
conan is just a max level bard from D&D walking around in real life lol. Dude has insane levels of charisma and ability to improve. Everyone who talks to him always seems to have a great time
This is the best episode of all time.
What a legend, best episode ever!
Been watching Conan since his first show in 93 when I was a freshman in HS; this is the old school Conan I loved growing up
right off the bat he's literally so right 😭😭😭😭😭
F*CKING FINALLY
I need coco so much rn. The world needs coco ❤
Is Conan alive?
Just one word!!! BOSS.
The fact that I share a birthday with Conan 🫡🥹
I always eat KFC after watching this show 😩
Conan took Da Bomb without his eye vein exploding, respect
Absolute legend
a perfect, perfect boy.
Best. One. Ever. (In my opinion)
Conan is an absolutely comedy orginal gangster. Top tier funny.
Honestly, I was never a Conan fan, really, but caught a clip online of him doing the tonight show; I'm not a Fallon fan either; was a good clip tho. I have never watched Hot One's either before this clip, was some good stuff.. 👍
This might as well be the show finale! Would be very difficult to top this because Norm is dead.
One for the ages!
Drinking the hot sauce directly from the bottle is so gangster🫡🫡🫡
3:34 that’s my birthday too
What kind of comedy king brings his own doctor and acts out the caotic taste of the hot ones, hahhahahahah I love him best episode ever!
I’d hate to be his bathroom
He's the GOAT, and it's not particularly close. We're not worthy.
Whoa. Never play poker with that guy!
Best one ever 🤣😅😆😂 I can't stop laughing....
Best episode ever
watched hundreds of episodes.....this one.....this is it..
He’s the GOAT 🎉
no contest, best guest ever. Conan is unstoppable
Man! I even didn't notice that 9:07 gone!  This guy is very entertaining 😅
best episode yet!!
The complete chaos that is Conan. I love him
The ending was probably the best ending of all time! It was passionate and actually really sincere. To the point I could have teared up 😂. This hands down will go as the greatest episode ever!
I was literally on the edge of my seat yelling at the television, CONAN STOP!  You are my hero Cone Zone!
This is absolutely in my top 3 favorite episodes. Tears are rolling down my face.
The most unhinged Hot Ones and I am here for it.
Man ! Conan! Hahahhahahahahahahahah
Conan looked like he was close to biting down on the glass of his drinks 😅😂
Conan is an awesome guest. Love his energy !
I've seen them all and this is by far the best. Conan brought his 90s and early 200s energy!!!
"I like to announce my mistakes upfront." - Conan O'Brien
Incredible. Absolutely incredible
This proves O’Brien hasn’t ever watched the show.
There has never been a better interview in the history of the world.
You've been requesting Conan for years, we've been chasing Conan for years, and the Hot Ones interview has finally arrived! What was your favorite moment?
Da Bomb always, Hit’s the Guest
Love Conan! He's definitely the King of Hot Ones! 🔥
This is the best episode ever.
Great interview. Both of them talking about the nature of the biz. Also his red lips make him my next choice for the joker. Next to Defoe.
Ive watched this 4 times already 😂 love you, Conan!!
God I love this man
About Time 🎉
Peak comedy
The King
Conan is the new wing king😆
Legend
Where do you even go on from this? This is the absolute peak of Hot Ones.
21 min in nearly turned into the joker look wise anw.
I have been waiting years for this episode!!! Conan is the best!!
No need for a thermometer. Just gauge how red the face is.
Best ever! Not even close!
Guys, I think Conan won the game
Conan is garbage
With a name like Conan, he's had a lot to live up to his whole life. The hot sauce will reveal all. There's taking a challenge head on & then there's Conan taking on a challenge. Legendary indeed.
Conan last dabbed "Da Bomb".. 😮
Conan is fab . Watch his shows from the UK on YouTube inc all the  late night debacle . Would love to see Piers Morgan for us brits . Well done Conan . 🎉❤
The best episode ever shown in history.
Why is he pocketing the wings? 😂😂
charlie rose with wings
One of the best guests of all time 😂
عبقري. سابق زمانه. هذا كل ما يمكنني قوله.
Conan is the Goat!
You gotta love Conan. This guy is a real genius.
Best hot ones ever! I have never commented on anything but I have to say. " Best Hot Ones ever!
Covid O'Brien
😂
Absolute. F*ckin. Legend.
We need Gordan Ramsay and Conan on an episode TOGETHER!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤣
He is going to regret this so much the next time he takes a number 2..
best guest ever
OK - One wing in and Sean has already proven he is a better interviewer of Conan than Fallon ever will be. (If you don't believe me, just look up Fallon's 'interview' from a few days ago where Conan basically interviews himself while Fallon laughs like he always does...)
I love Conan. the man is  COMMITED. This was a great episode, congrats!
Well... That... was an interview...
Who makes that jean jacket that Conan is wearing? I love the red.
Conan 😂 knew them levels of  flavors before he got there!!!
Conan will forever be my fav late night talk show host. What a goofy legend
Going to Haiti anytime soon Conan? It is a $hithole!  😂😂😂
What a great show from a showman
Conan is a legend, lol
Conan is a national treasure and must be protected at all costs! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
the hotter it gets the more it looks like Conan has lip stick on lol
FANTASTIC
lol hes crazy
Best Hot Ones guest ever! I love Conan.
Had to rewatch it after just watching it 😂
Honestly the best guest you have had thus far and that’s saying a lot. I’ve watched multiple seasons and Conan made me laugh through the whole interview he still got it
We can only pick ONE favorite moment? 😂
Love Conan!
I never realized how much Conan sounds like young Ted Mosby
Putting the half-eaten wings in his pocket without any explanation is a great bit.
This episode is pure gold! Conan is king!
that was a great build up to the end.
😂🤣
Woah. I was wondering what the 11th president of Finland was doing these days. She has become a funny guy. Way to go! 🏳‍⚧
Conan could wrestle the Hulk and win if he thought it would make a single complete stranger laugh
Oh my god
Incredible 😂
Watching for the second time. Will be back.
This is beyond incredible. Conan remains my tv hero.
He takes a single bite then puts it in his pocket. Is that cheating?
Lmooo I like the video before it started because u knew this was going to be the best half hour of my life 😂 what a treat! Congrats Sean!!
Conan O’Brien is a national treasure and the best late night host there’s ever been.
Finally someone worth watching
nice one
Dumber is his job. To help lower your iq and make you compliant
VINTAGE Conan
He was the last true late night host. Kimmel, Fallon, Corben and all the new ones don't have his charm, professionalism and humor. They all whine and use their shows for their own agendas. I miss Conan.
The greatest Hot Ones ever.
Mans a legend ! ❤
Conan is my favorite talk show host and for me the best
What background music did you use here?
This episode truly highlights Conan’s comedic genius and his willingness to do whatever it takes to get the laughs. After 276 episodes, it’s hard to find one that stands out in the way that this one did. Kudos to Sean and the Hot Ones team for this excellence!
1998 i got indoctrinated  into Rockefeller poisons. In other words. And I'm a white coat listen to me. Or respect my authority
RIP Halle Berry, there’s a new ruler.
"Can you check my pulse, no your just choking me. "
Conan is the BEST talk show host EVER!!!!!!!! And HILARIOUS 😂😂😂😂
Best hot ones yet! Love Conan
His stylist is so mad he put those wings in his pocket😭
Best episode ever!!!
This guy is freaking a genius! I love Conan
One of the best episodes ever. Conan is a legend.
This is out of control in every way lol
Thats it, shut it down forever, Conan just defeated Hot Ones.
Conan somehow got even oranger.
Nobody will ever beat this one!
Yes a talking head that knows what corruption  is
Bert's got a new favorite.
Conan is an international treasure
Best episode ever!
what a beast!!!!
Adding Conan to anything is basically an automatic money printing machine. He's the best ever.
Winner.
I love Conan!!!!
Conan brought skits!
Very few videos on youtube that invoke belly-laughs - but this is one of them
Is Sean Evan's accent different, almost singing like?
This is the top of the mountain. Thats my favourite episode so far and I can not immagine a better performance
Love it, but the music is very very annoying
23:03 you know it’s bad when the whites of your eyes go red 😂😂😂
absolutely impossible to top this legend.
Epic 😂
We NEED a Sean/Conan/Klaus episode.
Can I buy that jacket?
My stomach hurts from cry laughing!  This is the best one EVER!  THANK YOU CONAN!
This probably my fav hot one so far Conan top all the previous celebs. Guy is a mayhem 😂
GOAT
I wish Andy was there, too
21:32 😂you are INSANE Sir
Its crazy to think from being a writer on SNL, and some of the best Simpsons Seasons in the 90's, talk show host, then embracing longform audio and perfectly transitioning to podcasting, HBO travel show and now delivering the best performance on the popular hot sauce internet show by a mile, in terms of finishing the hot sauce, being funny and even in terms of being inspiring.
Oh my God!!! For the last half of this I was like, Conan STOP!!!
237k 3m v (Just a self note) 13 04 Sasáay
23:04 make it a meme
Is anybody else being mysteriously turned on by the freckles and the red hair? No, me either, just checking your pulse😅😅😅😅😅😮
WHY CANT I FEEL
He killed it .. 😂 🍿
Top tier episode. Undisputed.
A true american national tresure.
This and the Dave Grohl episode are tied as my absolute favorites. Conan is a madman and Dave is a badass
Sean chose violence when he decided not to say a word as Conan was opening Da Bomb 😂
"This is show business. You get the greatest show on Earth!"   Yes.
that man is a pure gem
He's so unhinged I love it
This was absolutely unhinged and glorious!
What I love about Conan is that he never takes himself seriously, and isn't afraid of making a fool out of himself! He is one of the realest ones out there!
As far as travel shows go, nothing will ever top An Idiot Abroad. Watch it
Best episode so far
This episode ended like a Rick and Morty episode: both characters shrieking at the top of their lungs.   What a legendary episode.
the greatest to ever do it
A tour de force. Truly incredible.
I’ve watched hot ones for years. This is by far the best episode yet! Conan went all out. Also I’ve never laughed in an episode till now.
Who knew Conan is such a beast? Hey Gordon Ramsey I’m talking to you.
The Best! Everything about it.
What a Fn BEAST Conan is, Love it. Hes the absolute best, Love him so much and a fantastic show.
The Goat eating Chicken wings..perfect
the pure chaotic energy the comes off of Conan needs its own sauce flavour.
Just a different kind of bearst, in the best way poppsiclce.
I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time. Conan is a legend.
This takes over the top spot as the greatest Hot Ones episode
The ending monologue will go down in history as one of the best
The best video on this channel. And this is interesting channel. So yeah.
See… when you can make TUNDRA funny, this is what happens.
I’ve never laughed so hard in my life after.  Conan O’Brien chugging down that hot sauce I lost it he was like a wild beast just chugging down that hot sauce
He’s too extra, not a fan
Best episode yet!
First one I ever quit. What was that dude on???
the music is annoying AF. Great episode tho! haha
Best episode ever. Absolutely love this guy, love the compliments to Sean for his awesome interviews as always.
I don’t remember the last time I laughed this much during an episode. Conan is a king and I can’t wait to hear about this experience on Conan Needs a Friend.
I live in the uk.  You guys have got to release this as a board game! Or challenge!  A lot of people would wanna try this. Even if it was dips and you put w.e in the sauce. Thousands of YouTube’s/ tic toks would appear!. English people love to try their spice tolerance!…. Especially after beers! Please bring this for summer/ Christmas 2024!! lol ❤ Keep up the good work!!! Long time subscrber :)
Best hot ones I've ever seen
Epic!!!!!
"As you know concrete is poured on floor, so camera's  can roll" LMMAOI!
Conan does bits, but will absolutely do ANYTHING to make things funny. He's due for a lifetime achievement award of some kind ffs
He’s really cringe in some spots…
amazing midlife crisis
Legend
Coco knows how to commit to a bit
BEST guest ever!!!!
Ugh this man is the best!!! He needs to come back to the tonight show!
So does anyone know where Conan is now? Is he alive??
Wow. Just wow. I get crazy "Socrates drinking hemlock" vibes from this. He went SO HARD.
The only late night host i can stand
Lol you can most definitely feel the spicy delirium coming through!
CalienteConann scares me
LOL @19:36 “Mediocore president? That’s so mean” *half a second later* “IM GONNA GO WITH-“ 😂😂
Loved this 😅
Okay Conan, I see you, you brought your A game nobody's leaving here saying no good show😂😂😂
Protect Conan. A real American.
Hahaha you learn nothing about the country, makes you dumber after watching it.
Favorite episode
Conan is a legend.
THE GREATEST episode ever!!
THE GREATEST episode ever!!
"What Telescope we're eating here?!" DAFUQ dude?!😂😂😂😂
I love this man with all my heart....i could not stop laughing and i tried not to laugh that final scene with him ranting killed me!😂😂😂😂😂😂
Literally the only time Sean didn’t mirror the guest. Conan’s a legend.
CONAN THE BARBARIAN!!!!!
Perfect Conan!
22:53 IM CRYING!!! The look of pure terror on Sean's face is SENDING me
My gosh! 😮 😮 I almost felt scared for Conan
This is the only full episode i have watched. Conan has done so much for comedy. Truly the best
🌞absobloominlutely hilarious!!!🤣
Conan looking for a spice-lord role in the new Dune or what?
Legend made
This is the most LEGENDARY episode!
The goat episode. As soon as he put the wing in his pocket I knew it
Best episode ever 👏 👏 😂 and I’ve been watching since season 1!!
THE BEST BEST BEST EPISODE EVER. Conan is a wonder.
I thought an episode couldn’t get more chaotic than the Eddie Huang interview but here we are
Love Conan so much
THE GOAT
The end feels like a bit from first season Rick and Morty
I appreciate that Conan is still in our lives.
I don’t think I laughed so hard in about 5 years
« I’ve never felt so alive. I’m errected for the first time in 15 years. This is to you ! CALL THE WIVE!!! »🎉
Dope
I think Conan has outshown Eric Andre 😂
Yaaaaasss!!
@28:27 living legend
That's the most unhinged I've ever seen Conan I loved it.
Didn't know Conan O'Brian turned into Timon from Lion King for spicey bits
Hero and a legend
..... this is Tom Cruise jumping on sofa cringe..... what did you do to him?
When's the conan biopic coming out haha
Man this guy is so funny
Not only a god of comedy but a god of eating wings.  Legend.
One of the best episodes 😂
That’s a monumental piece of entertainment by one of the greatest ever. Loved how Sean seemed to enjoy it 😂
This might be one of the funniest episodes I’ve ever seen. Absolutely spectacular.
Conan systematically dismantled this show. Took complete control and made a mockery of the hot ones format. I don’t think there should be any more episodes
Conan is amazing, He is the most powerful comedian
one of the all time greats!!! unreal episode - easily the best hot wings!!
An absolute beast of a show.
WOW Conan absolutely destroyed it! Congrats man
This was by far the funniest and best episode ever 😂 He is a mother fin nut! I loved it!
Totally the best one!!! I miss watching Conan
The peak of this show. How will y'all top this????
THIS IS THE GREATEST EPISODE OF HOT ONES - PERIOD.
Best EP of hot ones  Thnx for being such a entertaining champion Conan!
Put Conan with Cody co and I swear you’ll see a masterpiece
Well that was just the greatest thing ever!!!
"The other guy..." 😂
Conan O’Brien understands the assignment.
The Mad King of Comedy, Ladies and Gentlemen. That’s why Conan will always be the GOAT.
Getting the viewers confused at the beginning as the perfect set-up for all that was to follow... We just got to witness the art of comedy unfold right before our eyes!
Note to the host: dont talk over the guest (especially when it’s conan obrien)
Call the wife!😂😂😂
he did it for the culture.
Ok so its Shia and Conan?   who woulda thunk
Magnifico!!!
Best episode aired. Loved it. Legend !
I love those two in one room, amazing people amazing entertainment
Love you Conan!!!!
graham norton, stephen colbert and conan o'brien are the holy trinity of late night talk show
The Greatest Hot Ones 🔥 Episode Ever, Period......
Luv u Conan
hands down the best episode ever
He out did Steve-O
I grew up watching him on TV, this was amazing and one of my favorite episodes ever.  This man is a LEGEND!
Conan is the best.
Best.  One.  Ever
I see Conan, I press like, then I watch
Conan saying "you say this is pure pepper?" while devouring that wing might be my favorite moment 😂
Never fails. Legend
I've always wanted to go on this show just to do exactly what Conan O'Brien just did. This guy's a monster.😊
I would love to see Jimmy Kimmel and Guillermo next!
By far, the years of watching this show. This interview was the best. Congratulations on another season in. Didn't disappoint at all.
The greatest Hot Ones of all time
WHATS WRONG WITH ME WHY CANT I FEEL
the most annoying interview in Hot Ones lol
Conan is the GOAT!
Best hot ones ever!!!!!!!
I’ve also never felt more alive watching an episode of Hot Ones. 😂
Legendary
He's actually insane 😂 😂 😂
From where I'm standing, best episode of the series.
24:58 finally.. a new potential profile pic for me
Absolute MADHOUSE of an episode. My sides hurt from laughing.
The man is a true professional. He stuck to the bit throughout the whole episode 😂
feel like conan has always existed in a similar sphere as james may. like american and british counterparts to eachother. very different but fills equivalent niches
this wasn't the last dab, bro this was the whole bottle
my word
best episode lol
😂 UNHINGED 😂
That was the best hot ones I’ve ever seen. Conan killed it!!
*Taking the wings home not leaving DNA behind rule#1 never get cloned*
Omfg. This was perfection. What a way to go out. Thank you both.
Best episode ever!!
I fear I want him
chris farley vibes lol
That was the best episode ever. Conan rolled Ultimate Hard. Dude is untouchable. Respect!!!
Oh my, Conan was a beast. But you knew towards the end, he was hurting like crazy.
We need Cillian Murphy hereeee!!! Love the show❤
He’s saving the wings to add Da Bomb later. Not hot enough.
Please Destroy the Internet by having Nardwar!!
Watch minute 23:00 first then go back to 2:15 😂😂
Please oh please share the footage of Sean’s face when Conan dunks Da Bomb all over his wing 🤯
RIP Conan
Conan is one of, if not the funniest person alive. What a legend
best episode.
nah it was a bit haha
Holy (hot) S***!! Now THAT is commitment. Conan has truly launched himself, head and shoulder, knees & toes over EVERY other Hot Ones guest...EVER! 😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😝
Most people who have defeated the gauntlet with ease were people I expected. I did not expect him to dominate those sauces like he did. Conan the Barbarian.
The. Best. Season. Finale. Guest. Ever. Period.
Conan is a maniac 😂😂😂😂😂
probably the BEST episode ever...
The orange fingers when he acts like Nixon 😂😂😂😂
If Conan tells u ur a great interviewer ur a great interviewer ♥️❤️♥️
I was hoping that Sean would ask a question about his time on the Simpsons regardless what a great episode!
22:31 When Baldur fell victim to Freya’s spell
This is by far one of the best episodes ever.  There's "chewing the scenery" and there's Conan ripping and tearing until it is done.
Best episode ever.
I cannot love this enough!
Conan is the GOAT!  One of my favorite comedians.
magnum opus
Clearly on the Rushmore of hot ones
LFG
He kinda freaked me out.
Welp that’s a mic drop on hot ones. They will never top what Conan just did.
conan is one of the funniest people of all time
This is why I have and will always love Conan! Just a boss. Putting wings in his pocket?!!!! Such nonsense and I love it.
Conan the freakin savage barbarian! How is that even physically possible? He should be declared the next potus eventhough he's not in the race. And also the king of the world 🌎 We conanites believe in the legend.
Conan's travel shows are so good.
Looks like Conan O'Brien did listen to Scarlett Johansson. The real questions now is "Was this what she was expecting?".
Conan is the real barbarian 😂
Paul Rudd has been my all time favorite.  Until now...
Haha, classic Conan. Love it
What an amazing episode!!! Conan you’re the best !!!! Conan is genuinely funny !!!!!!!!!! 😂
It is time. Conan hath cometh.
Conan!!
Total GigaChad
How do you top this episode?
this has got to be the single greatest hot ones interview in its history.
Genius!
this wasss the funniest episode
What did I just watch?
Cocaine’s a helluva drug
This is by far the best episode this show has had in awhile, possibly ever.
Both are pure geniuses. This is my all time favourite Hot Ones episode!
Now why was Conan pocketing all the wings he saving them for later ?
❤🥵🥵
Conan Belushi'd that hot sauce bruh😂
Made all the Bostonian Irish that have been on the show look weak and frail 😂😂😂😂
Margaret Dumont
Conan is one of the greatest showmen out there. He can always tap into some kind of energy if he wants to give a performance.
Just amazing.
🔥
I don't feel so good.
DEAR GOD ALMIGHTY!!! THIS IS SO UNHINGED!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA YOoOOoOooO!!!   "I'M FINE, I'M-PERFECTLY-FINE!!!!"   Same Conan, Same.
tough guest
there is absolutely no way he actually ate all this capsaicin without vomitting, while drinking so little and still being able to focus on the questions at the end, I'm 100% sure they faked at least some of the sauces
You need to calm down with the viewer bots...
Conan's lifetime of humor saved me on days when I couldn't find a reason to find joy.  Thank God for Conan!  (And Triumph!)
Conan has broken a new level. Bring back the ultimate ice bucket challenge with hot sauce instead.
Instant top 10
GOAT! GOAT! GOAT! 🐐🐐🐐
I love Conan!!!! he's the best I missed his shows so much
"I don't fear your wings man"  -Conan O'Brien 2024
I think this was the happiest Sean we've ever seen
Nobody is better than Conan
4 years tops. JK!! Conan forever, please.
Ugh I miss Conan
Conan is the Best of all Sean!
Paul Atreides step aside, we have a new spice lord here.
Absolutely phenomenal episode!! Hilarious!!
Oh my God. That was intense! Great season team.
Does anyone know who Conan's favorite Stooge is? Conan is comedy royalty. Proud he's from Boston.
I love Conan O'Brien. This is great.
Oh gawd this was funny 😂😂 👏👏
Conan's Hubris just keeps escalating and its both hilarious and frightening, amazing how he has lived this long with the way he is 😂
I don't know that there is anyone on the planet who can make me laugh harder than Conan when he goes off the rails. I laughed until I cried at the end. He's a master idiot of the highest order.
Turn out the lights, we've reached the end of the internet and it. is. glorious to behold.
I was wondering when they would finally get the greatest talk show host of all time and of course he didn’t let down this was hands down my favourite episode of all time, all the love Mr. O’brien! ❤
Man Conan you earned my respect 💜💜
Conan hit a grand slam
He Will Farrell'd it.
that's THE Hot Ones Show!!!!!!!! one and only! the ultimate! the kind of reaction we've been waiting for since the beginning!!!! that's how you're supposed to eat hot wings of death!
I should have known this would be the best episode of Hot Ones, but somehow Conan always surprises me.
3M in one day, Conan is a beast. He needs to host a show again.
I may not like Conan's type of comedy, but I'm glad a lot of people do. He's a real one. Puts everything into making a show great.
Truly, the most terrifying performance ever captured on camera
I feel so bad for his toilet later 😂😂this was amazing 😂😂
He is a living legend!
So many incredible moments in this one. Conan has yet to disappoint after doing it for 30+ years.
I was yelping and gasping and crying laughing at the library this was wild
“You say this is PURE pepper”?? 😂😂😂
Dr. Arroyo coming in to choke Conan had me dead!
GOAT 🔥🔥🔥🔥
It is SO COOL that Conan is giving so much serious insight about show business, even though he is being hilarious here and there, too. And in the end, he delivers one of the greatest monologues of the last years of every YT show whatsoever.
#1 best hot ones episode!! Bobby Lee at #2 now.
Conan O’Brien looks like Dolf Lundgren and Gordon Ramsay had a baby
Where can i meet Dr. Arroyo? I've had severe impotence for years, but now I'm totally healed just watching him do his magic on Conan!!!!! I have got to have him check my pulse (wink wink)
"It used to be called HBO,  but they found that too POPULAR!"   Not a lie lol.
GOAT Episode!
Best Hot Ones ever!
the fact he ate that much da bomb is insane literally a tiny drop of that with set your mouth on fire and every breath makes it even hotter
He def did the oil trick to take on all that hot sauce
Best hot ones ever. Conan is the goat
GOAT
The farley memories in him came out lol😂love this
O my Gosh... he's an f'ing monster!
The cut to Conan's demented face before he says "I'm fine" will never fail to make me laugh
Oh my god. Sean didnt know what hit him. He just sat and enjoyed the ride. This has to be, hands down, THE best episode of Hot Ones to date!
After the first wing, his face was red and his eyes was watering. He is a good actor. Because i know he was dying.
Best Hot Ones episode
Only Conan would bring one of his writers onto hot wings for a gag.   Hilarious.   Love Jose Arroyo  Conan is the best.   God i love this guy
Legend
why don;t you show Sean "joining' on the guest adding more hot sause? maybe he didn't add all extra sause on top of wings as Conan did
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahha 😂😂😂😂😂
COnans the goat
This by far is the best hot ones episode out there!!!!
Conan just raised the bar so effing high it'll likely never be touched. Been watching him since '99ish. Late night GOAT. Nobody comes close and never will. Still dominating new ventures. Everything this guy touches turns to gold. ❤🎉🙌🙏🫡 Easily my favorite Hot One's by far.
Conan, you killed.
Conan! Conan! Conan! Conan! Conan! Conan! Conan!
doctor not there for the wings, doctor is there to mentally help Conan XD
That was epic
Legendary and comedic brilliance! 🙇
Absolute Legend. Love Conan.
I Love Conan
This is a masterpiece
My roommate asked me if there was a fire? Because I stoped dropped and rolled laughing !
Conan should play as The Joker in a film. Before every take give him some Beyond Insanity hot sauce and you might have film gold.
What an icon
Conan really took this to another level. 110% respect.
❤❤❤عالی
A special thanks to whomever is responsible for the animated version of Conan's water buffalo story.  So. Frickin. Hilarious. And I love Conan so much; his call to read everything and find the humor in it makes my heart happy ❤
The best Hot Ones EVER!!!
“It was supposed to be” is possibly the funniest answer to an already funny “Was it a 4 year medical school?”
Homebody legit was lost in the sauce at the end 😂😂
I think he pulled a Homer Simpson, and drank hot wax before he ate the wings.
I have to say, this is the best episode of Hot Ones yet! Where could the show possibly go from here?
Best to ever do it.
And yet Conan struggled to eat a sloppy Jalapeñ-joe with will Arnett.
This was impressive
😂 this is the buffoonery the world needs!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The absolute Greatest!
Wow mad respect to Conan I bet he ate a gallon of ice cream after that one😂👍✊🇺🇸
This is probably the best Hot Ones I have ever watched 😂
Conan is one of the funniest people of all time
I love this man
Conan has taken hot ones to a whole new level. 👑 I don’t know how they can ever top this 😅
Best ever to do the show
Conan is the goat!!
I think we've come full circle in the sense that a daily broadcast of Late Night with Conan O'Brien is what we really need right now.
Best show in years
Jesus effin Christ! What a closing!
retire the form.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Thats my man Obrien
The last item on my bucket list; Conan on Hot Ones.  I can now rest in peace.
Bringing Jose Arroyo is one of the best things ever. You can tell he always was genuine and his writers are loyal to this day.
As much as I would like to say that I'm surprised....I grew up on Conan and believe he can conquer anything.
Conan is one of the greatest comedians of our time!
I have been waiting for conan o'brien to be on this show for so long. This episode is hands down the best of hot ones.
I have massive respect for Conan. I don’t think anyone will ever top this performance and he  deserves our respect and adoration.
This is truly the best episode yet. What a way to end a season. Sean my hats off to you. For your amazing interview skills, and fun guests.
Conan is a legend. It's hard to describe how the bomb ruins your life for 20 min to people who haven't tried it. He knowingly adds more and the look of sheer panic on his face, as he tries to keep the not hot bit going.. gives me all the schadenfreude.
Compare this to the Ice Spice episode and just appreciate this man this much more.
Conan is looking more like John Wayne around the eyes.  Entertaining in an old school way, too. 🫡
Best Hot Ones Episode Ever 😂😂😂 ❤ U Connan!
The Hot Ones to top all Hot Ones. Conan is a beast!
What a legend. Jordan Schalansky should be next!
My man turned into Lewis Black and Gilbert Gottfried towards the end there 😂
this might be the best one theyve ever recorded
Brilliant
the doctor is killing me😭😭😭
I was belly laughing for 10 minutes straight that was incredible 😂 I love Conan so much
I never laugh so hard to any hot ones episode 🤣🤣😂😂❤❤
Yessss! Finally
Phuckin' brilliant!  One of the best ever!  Thanks for the laughs out loud, Conan is awesome!!  😂😂😂😂
absolutely incredible.
Best episode ever!!!
Conan is one of, if not THE best talk show host ever. One of the rare hosts who are actually funny and a great interviewer
Completely unhinged. I love it!
Brilliant
After 21:22 my 4 year old daughter turned to me and said "That guy is crazy." 😂
This is MY show now - Conan O'Brien 😁 What a guy!  Especialy compared to unfunny irelevant hacks like Jimmy Kimmel or Stephen Colbert...
The real " who do you think you are? i am!"
He is so good with show business and even with that he stays funny he stays humble and respectful when he needs. He is one of my idols but one of my favorite people ever
This is one of the best episodes of all time 😂
Hands down the greatest episode ever! Conan is the man!
how do you top that?
It's a Masterpiece of Hot Ones + Conan💞
Is the epic music supposed to distract the viewers attention?
One of the best - if not THE BEST - interviews in this show. Bravo!
The goat
He really channeled his inner Robin Williams. And I’m all here for it.
I love how he can keep a straight face during his little skits, Conan is a real experienced entertainer
Youre always my idol Conan! Cant wait to see more crazy content!
Best episode ever
Conan is the best
Conan is one, and one only ! Best episode ever !
Best episode ever, best guest ever, Conan is a comedy GOD!
"I bet you live 4 more years tops"
the music today though was annoyingly loud and untuned to the tone of the answers
Red heads have different pain receptors than other people. They take more anesthesia to put them under, too.   He’s like the king of red heads.
Phenomenal 🤣
My friend is a redhead and a scientist she has to take twice the dose of many meds and has an extremely high pain tolerance which is apparently linked to the redhead gene. I’d bet Conan’s ability to drink hot sauce despite his lack of history with spicy food might be the same phenomena 🤓
Conan would make a great US Taskmaster.
Best. Episode. Ever.
I've seen all these episodes this is BYFAR THE BEST!!!
The best one 🍺💯
The GOAT
My favorite late night tv show host of all time. To me, CONAN is THE GOAT. I still watch his skits when I feel sad or bored. He brings so much joy to me. Love you Cocan.
What an Effing Legend. I love it so much.
Conan on hot sauce is very funny.
Genius.
I cannot wait to hear the Conan Needs A Friend episode about this.
Best episode yet! ❤ he got so red at the end 😂😂😂
Huge fan of Conan, watched and listened to a lot of his work, yet he still surprises me time and time again. He always gives it 110 % and becomes a radiating fireball of comedy. When you thought he has hit his highest gear, he takes it up a notch. Crazy guy haha Amazing 😂
The end of this episode feels like a rick sanchez rant ahahhahah
Wish Conan would have put a little bit more into this episode
how is this possible he leaked the worst one hahaha
Conan is a class act. Long live CONANDOOOOOOOOOOO
I'm doing my first standup comedy set in front of an audience tonight and this is the most inspiring thing I've ever seen in my entire life!
real question, do they play the epic music in studio or is that added in post. did conan get to hear the music get epic or did he force the editors to match his energy?
Conan is so good infront of a camera
Lol great show! Did Conan purposely get Covid b4 going on to help him along?
Freaking LEGEND
Thank you for being you, Conan. You are truly a legend and an icon that will be praised for years and years to come.
His poor bhole the next day 😂 🔥💩
What an absolute lunatic, haha.  The most insane episode from one of the oldest guests in show history.  The youngins who just take a nibble should be ashamed!
The music in this is so distracting 😖
Now this is something I’ve always wanted THANK YOU BEEN WAITING YEARS
I looooooove that he brought an actor to the show!!! that's new!!!!
This guy never stops performing.  Legend
Absolutely amazing.  😂😂😂😂
This was one of the best episodes of hot ones! Conan understood the assignment
This was amazing.
By far....the best episode EVER!!! No one will ever beat Conan.  fada beo na hÉireann
Conan just reached 🐐 status. He was always knocking on the door but he just broke the hinges.
Conan is a pure class act. Legendary episode.
Absolutely unhinged. Watched it twice.
This is peak Hot Ones.
Absolutely ICONIC!
I think we found the “hot ones” king of all kings
Can’t help but love Conan. Wing drop.
This is the single best piece of digital media that’s ever been bestowed upon the internet.
The king.
Connan is an unstoppable force
Amazing. Thank you Conan
How is this one of the most motivational videos I've ever seen? Conan literally just being himself. Best episode by far.
There's funny everywhere. That hit me
This one will win them all
This is so unhinged, Conan forever 😂
This might be the greatest thing I've seen on Youtube.
Conan and Tom Cruise are dead set on dying on camera to make the bit work ...
Was it a 4 year medical school?  It was supposed to be.
I never comment on videos and I had to! I looooove Conan and this is the BEST hot ones ever! I have watched this 5 times already and can’t stop laughing each time!
Jesus Christ someone get this man his own talkshow.
20:50 😬
17:53 why am i not surprised  Nixon motorboating...
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT'S WHY HE'S THE GOAT  THE GOAAAATTTT!!!!
"Can I keep these?"
He embraced the spice! He is LISAN AL GAIB!
Can’t describe my happiness when I saw Conan pop up on the Hot wings update!!!! He’s the absolute best and it warms my heart to see how much people revere him and his work! His genuineness flows through the screen  and you can tell that he’s just there to basically have fun while also answering questions thoughtfully
FINALLY! Someone who actually tries to clean the wing rather than having the most miniscule bite and then claiming they can take spicy food. Also what an absolute legend, this was the funniest episode EVER!
Some guests start to fall apart as the Scovilles rise and the pain becomes unbearable. Conan seemed to just get more focused and intense. I'm surprised he didn't rub it in his eyes just to see what would happen...
I had no idea I was waiting for this until I saw Conan's face with a wing in his hand. We have atrrived at the summit, and all I watched is the first 1.2 seconds. There will never an equal Hot Ones. Conan is the all-time greatest guest on this show, even b4 I hit play  Gonna watch 6x. Myabe 8
This is my favorite Hot Ones episode now.
New best episode 👑
When Conan O'Brien is mad he sounds like shake from aqua teen hunger Force. LoL
Fkn HILARIOUS! 🤣
CALL THE WIFE 😂🔥
That was a lot.
Great episode. Coco don't play
I can't think of any better guest I've seen on this show.  He is number 1 I think.
wow this show was crazy
Good telly
Conan is funny af😂😂😂
Awesome episode 😂
rick vibes
Best Hot Ones Ever .
always on, never off. legend
the best episode
That might be the most impressive wings eating display I have ever seen.
Still not as entertaining as Ice Spice
He’s THE best!
its crazy for 70 year old to do this, so hilarious
You should leave the show dumber for real successfully got me wanting to watch the show i will be seated
Conan is peak T.V. Drama, comedy, showmanship, wit; Pure cinema!
Pure, unhinged, comedy gold
Nah, this just aint gonna cut it!!! Conan needs to eat the hottest pepper ever!! The dude drank from the bottle, are you serious? This is jedi master level right there!
What a beast,,   WOW,  Conan the Hot Ones Barbarian just set the bar at a whole new level
After the last couple guests, they said get someone loud and goofy like the 3 stooges.  Done.
This is peak Hot Ones. A testament to what it’s become and a tribute to what came before to make it possible.  Conan, what a legend
I haven't laughed like that in a while, thanks Conan & Sean!
FINALLY!!!!!
I'm still laughing just thinking about this a day later. Legendary.
Please tell me he was okay after this
9:13 made me laugh way too hard
Easily just became my hero
He's just an absolute showman through and through 😂
What a hard ending to watch.😂😂😂
Killed it.
Best Hot One's episode of all time and it's not even close.
Dr. Arroyo is the affordable doctor we all need 👌
best hot ones guest ever!! please bring him back every season
The goat!
Best episode ever
Pure ecstasy
I love when two worlds collide and become an instant classic! Conan is the best.
Aaahhh the satisfaction of a great Friday feature on Friday 😊
Wow. GOAT
That was epic
New favorite episode for me. Wow.
The escalation was unreal. Best episode ever.
dude.... he destroyed hot ones. if hot sauce was a final boss in a game it would be Conan
This interview went to places I had not anticipated and that is why I watch! Truly something else!
That sauce was so good IT MADE CONAN STOP BEING WEIRD CONAN FOR 1 MOMENT. 😂 First time i think ive ever seen Conan not hiding behind that mask 🫡
Dr Arroyo, where did you go to medical school? “In 1998” Where? “Umm, out of state”. You should go.
Is the doctor also a comedian?  Conan: check the pulse Doctor: its there Phenomenal 😂😂😂😂😂
Conan is worshipped as a god in Finland.
we <3 you so much Conan
Conan channeling Chris Farley and it’s amazing. 23:05
I've never seen someone jump into DA BOMB like that.
That was a great way to close out your season 😂😅
I'm sorry but this is the greatest piece of art ever committed to film
This is THE perfect platform for Conan. He thrives off of self-deprecation. Didn’t need to hear the reviews to know this would be top tier ❤
A lot of people throw this word around but Conan is an actual legend
this is the only episode that made me feel the spicy hot of the wings went through my computer and tasted it myself  GREAT SEASON ENDING!🔥GREAT EPISODE GREATNESS EVEEEER!!!!
Conan is the greatest showman ever
I never comment, but good lord, this is peak entertainment and comedy. "Dr. Arroyo, would you check on my friend here?" "Yeah it's not good"
way to DO IT Conan!!!!!
Conan getting a Dr to get a baseline before beginning just absolutely brilliant
Legend
What a freaking beast!
This was the best episode of anything ever
It was like having master shake as a guest!! Coco 🤘🤘
such a amazing finale episode!
Conan is the best. Love love love me some Conan
I was not expecting this to be as utterly unhinged as it was.   Bravo, Conan - one of the best episodes I've seen yet.
Conan has a kind of Robin Williams vibe in this interview.
It might be the best episode ever. The guy subverted the concept and made an excelent point: why we would not watch an excelent interview for the sake of It? Why do we crave the shock?
I've already watched the entire episode 6 times. Best guest ever not even close.
I really hope Conan gets additional shows because he is a true professional and his comedy is gold.  His reruns are priceless.  Hopefully studios figure that out.
Brilliant. Absolutely madness, stupidity and good Q&A. This is the heart of Hot ones.
That was awesome😂
We don’t have enough entertainers like Conan. This man is one of a kind and absolutely no one is similar to him
im literally crying this was the most hilarious video ive seen in a while
Conan is the King of Hot Ones! This was the greatest episode ever!
Bro Conan got more views than Shakira and Ice Spice he the man
after the recent mehs, this is the one I have been waiting for the man is a genuine genius who proves that Harvard is never over-rated
Da bomb always has the best reactions. John Oliver “it’s not the worst thing we’ve ever done as people, but it’s indicative of our worst instincts“ Conan O’Brien “I don’t have many regrets in my career, but this.”
Conan was the greatest tonight show host ever. None comes even close these days.
The best episode yet.. Conan did not disappoint
"I like to announce my mistakes up front" ...Can I use that? I'm gonna use that forever now...
That cartoon rendition of conan and the bull was halarious
season finale?? idk y'all, i'd just wrap it up after this
I fear Coco now...madman!
Oh my god, I can't for the life of me remember when I laughed this much. Best episode yet - by far! Conan is the funniest man alive.  Thank you both for giving us this gift ❤
That was mental 😂
best hot ones ever!
He puked. You can see it 😂
The best episode ever.  Conan is a genius!  😆
There goes my hero
best episode ever
Conan o'brien is undoubtedly one of the funniest men alive, And this was him more serious 😅😅😅😅
motivacional. gracias Conan
My, did he break your show?
Conan crazy is the best crazy.
i know eddie burback loves this video
Best one yet!!
Conan never made me laugh harder..😂😂😂
Conan is goat 😅
perfect season end!
i think jimmy fallon is just here to balance the talk shows out. because someone as great as conan is hard to believe that a jimmy fallon can be a talk show host.
That was awesome!
This is the most I laughed in a while. Love you Conan!
The GOAT
This was stunningly funny. What I REALLY want to know is what was Conan's life like for the 30m-1hr right after this HAHAHAHA
That was a ride! Wow!
Love Conan to the max and have been waiting for his episode with hot ones.  Oh boy oh boy and what a ride it was. Sir Conan, you're an absolute legend ! 🙏🏽
Quite literally the best episode of hot ones of all time and I haven’t even finished it yet 👏
Conan had me laughing beggining to end. Easily best hotones episode Iv seen and I have literally watched every single one. Love it.
“I don’t fear your wings, man.” 👈😏
God bless Conan for even after thirty years, still gives it 100% in entertaining the people.
Conan officially takes the top 5 spot this season with his " So my question to you is...." 14:00 😂😂😂
I'm here for the comments
Boost
Man Conan is the GOAT!
Bro thought he ate
I'm a fan of this show and have been for a long time and I've loved multiple guests and I can bet you and I both thought we'd seen the best of the best but we can always rely on Conan to give us a proper belly laugh 😂 This Man is a comedic genius 💯
Can i double like please!
was this show always filmed so awkwardly far apart or is this a COVID hold-over?
Here’s to you Conan ! you’re a great mfing guest!!
I feel like I just watched multiple masterclasses at once.
😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥
am I the only one who immediately thought of Max Weinberg as soon as Conan said 'Max'?
Conan! Conan! Conan!
As a mexican, I demand to get a match with another mexican invited ... Not f. Salma Hayek, not Gabriel Iglesias, not even the another one .... This man is making ridiculous show on mex team
Arroyo is now my favorite Conan side character
"I don't fear your wings, man.  Bring what you got."
“Charlie Rose show with hot wings” really really got me 😂
Yassssssssssssssssss
hahaha best one
I need to see Jordan on this show
And so it ends Hot Ones. What a good ride it was. Turn off the lights, Shut everything down and go home. There is nothing left to see beyond this episode.
Love to see hem on jre. Professional funny man. ❤
This is easily the most chaotic episode ever, and it was great!
Conan cursed Bea Arthur
What an absolute legend.
Conan is a legend.
The best one so Far, le Love You Sean Evans thanks for this content.
Best one yet!!! 😂🔥
One of the things that make me smile is knowing me and Conan share a birthday What a legends
He stole that from funny marco "Chicken in the pocket" no originality
Tame impala ryan gosling reference 4:04
Unhinged I love it. One of the funniest Conan bits I have seen in a while.
Conan is my hero
That was completely unhinged and amazing! Wow 🤣
Poor Sean. Trying to keep up with that maniac.
This episode is pure gold from start to finish 😂🔥
I’m getting wolf of Wall Street vibes 😂
I Can't stop laughing 😂😂😂 I miss Conan and really excited on his new show.
The greatest episode in the history of hotones
hes the greatest
"why can't i feel !! " lol
22:55 the concern on Sean’s face is absolutely priceless!!!! Conan is without a doubt the absolute funniest human that has ever been or will ever be!!! My hero!!!
Three days later, Conan passed away peacefully in his home surrounded by family but with the satisfaction of knowing that he gave his all on Hot Ones.
Remember when Conan used to be funny? Neither do I
CONAN IS THE BEST!!
23:49 - This shot of the chaos Conan has created and the slight pan up to the madman himself is the greatest shot ever on Hot Ones!!!🤣
GOAT King Conan
Epic
NO ONE WILL EVER TOP THIS
Wow! This episode could not have been any better! I have not laughed so hard in a while! Thank you!
I am obviously in the minority here, but I don't undertand what was supposed to be  funny about that?
Conan does a bit on someone else's show😂😂😂 98 from outta state😂when spicey makes you angry lol
Hilarious!!  Edit : If anyone's interested in knowing how Sean (the interviewer) came up with this spicy wings thing, i've made a video about it hehe (sorry for the promotion you gotta do what you gotta do)
Conan is a trickster god.
Am i surprised conan crushed the wings without much effort? No. Nothing surprises me with him anymore, lol😂😂 hes a fookin legend
Conan the goat
The long soliloquy about finding comedy in everything with his face a mess is amazing lol
Conan just isn’t that funny. Acting like a goofball just isn’t that funny. He has a big head and it looks funny. Flexes by putting spent wing bones in pocket. Dumb.
man conan is the best
I love this show and watched almost every episode. This episode was the best and most entertaining by far. Thank you Conan!
Do you mind? - puts wing in his pocket lol
Easily the best show yet.  Conan is a mad man!
This video has officially healed me. The only reason i'd die now is out of laughter from watching the master at work.
Best episode ever
The absolute GOAT
Now that's what we call committing to the bit.
Never since Tommy Cooper has someone been so naturally funny.
Dr. Arroyo looks very convincing… Conan please follow his medical advise 😂 Conan is crazy 😅
The best guest ever! COCO!!
The highest level of compliments right there! ❤
Conan is absolutely incredible! I really hope they didn't cut between these massive shots of hot sauce to make it seem better than it really was.
Peak comedy is Conan shoving chicken bones in his pocket
This has to be the best episode of hot ones!
Best episode ever
Best episode ever!
Conan is my favorite celebrity of all time and nothing will change this. I have never watched a full episode of the hot wings before
The GOAT
Conan is a total pro when it comes to all things entertainment. The man just gets it. Him giving kudos to Sean was some serious high praise.
Conan “Everything Is a Bit” O’Brien 🤣
One of the best episodes
😂
Conan is such a legend.  Writer for the Simpsons, SNL and a late night host for decades.
Conan went full on Bene Gesserit on them wings.  "I must not fear the heat. Heat is the mind-killer. Heat is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my heat. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the heat has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."
ICONIC 😂😂😂
Also, I fear for Conan's day after.
Would love to see some reaction shots of the crew.
Conan aka The Legend!
You almost should think about making this the show Finale, absolutely incredible!
now we need keanu reeves
I never write comments on YouTube, but I just want to say that Conan O'Brien won it.
Very smart to release your show the day before Taylor Swift's new album is released on the 19th. Your new show will grab the top headlines of the day. Go Conan !
bring on more comedians please!!!
His face was melting at the end 😂🤣
Easily the best episode ever
🐐 GOAT
THIS IS IT! THIS IS PEAK HOT ONES!
Madlad had me grinning like an idiot.
Hands down the best Hot Ones EVER!!  Conan the Great!!!
There's certainly an argument on what is the best episode. Maybe it's Shaq, or Lorde, or Steve Austin... Paul Rudd, Idris Elba, Tom Holland, the list goes on.   There is no debating that this episode is one of the greatest.
One of the best episodes ever!
Amazing! He really can't stop won't stop.
CONAN THE GOAT!!
A New Spice Lord.
"how long was your medical school?" "was supposed to be 4 years"
This is another reason why Conan Obrien is the freaking GOAT!
He's not funny at all
We’ve all been thinking it for a long time, but this proves he truly is a God.
LEGEND!!!!!!!
23:50 - Even Da Bomb is crying.. absolutely comedy cinema!
Hands down the greatest episode in history.
There is no tundra in Finland.
Greetings from Finland!:D
Best episode possible
Where did you go to med school? Uhm out of State. "You should go." I f--king love Conan.
16:59 18:40 19:41 I now know I have the work ethic of a president😂 20:41
BEST ONE, EVER!!!!!
this is too much :D
Suomi mainittu meidän punapäisen Kuninkaan toimesta, torille!
Did he just put a wing in his pocket
Conan is the greatest
God bless this man for making this the best and most chaotic episode EVER!!! 😂
Straight to comment section 😂
Absolutely the Best episode
Best episode EVAH!!!!!!
Why two tables now?
I started this episode thinking ‘Conan is really trying to be funny, I hope the hot sauce breaks his persona and wing after wing he stayed consistent. I was preparing for the hubris at the bomb and this man just ascended it…. That’s when I realized this man is just like that: professional chaos!   Kudos!
The way Conan unravels throughout this episode was a thing of beauty. I’ve been a fan of this man for literally 20 years because I couldn’t believe a late night host would commit his full body to the joke and 20 years later he’s still doing it. God tier, this man’s gonna live forever. Or 4 more years, tops 😂🤣
This might be the best Hot Ones performance of all time, what a legend
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks Conan!!!!!!!
Well folks, i think we just witnessed the best guest on hot ones. What a goat
Best one🎉
God I miss his talk show so much
The best guest by far. 🎉😂😂
Did we just watch a Top 10 of all time?
You gotta get Tim Robinson on here next
This was the best EVAAAAAAA! 😅😅😅😅😂
GOAT.
I'm honestly a little concerned about Conan's health. Consuming that much capsaicin is...unhealthy. I adore his commitment, but good god I hope that he takes care. I'm a spicy food lover and even I winced at the amount he may or may not have consumed. Seeing him actively change color through the interview was really something else.
Best episode by a mile
I've seen every single episode of Hot Ones, & this is instantly my all time favorite!! Conan is king!!!!
Best Episode Ever
This better become one of the most viewed episodes in Hot Ones history
comedy god
Conan came correct on this one. Paying an actor to play his doctor is legendary.
Conan, turning purple: "WHY CAN'T I FEEL???"  Honestly, same
Shut down the show, it will NEVER get better than this.
Best episode ever 😂
He's one of my favourite people in the world. And I don't even got that many.
Literally so unexpected and one of the best episodes ever. His commitment and will to literally power through anything for the performance is quite amazing! Robbin Williams level power there. That was a great watch. Thanks!
Conan is the true spice lord
Across his podcast episodes and all his remotes, I've probably listened to over 50% of what Conan has recorded publicly, and this is probably the best ad for him if you somehow haven't come across Conan yet.
this was the most deranged episode I have ever seen and boy, was it amazing :D
my god.... CONAN is the most socio-COmedy late host of the century ever 🤣🤣🤣
A legends performance by a true legend.
That was, without a doubt, the most intense and perfect Hot Ones ever made. I cannot see how it could ever be bested. Conan absolutely slayed! Bravo!
Hands down my favourite Hot Ones guest ever! Belly-laughed throughout, the perfect blend of jokes, bits, energy and chaos but still respected the questions and gave some great answers!
Who wants to see VIGGO MORTENSEN alias Aragorn on this show ??
i always forget how tall conan is
Great episode. Number 1 for me. Follow by Halle and Gordon I think.
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!! Such a dedicated man! Absolutely incredible!
Well a new bar has been set for the last dab right there.
I think this is the best episode ever.
"Can I keep these?"
“I am who I am,” -Popeye, but also Gandhi 😂😂😂
Bravo!
*stands up and claps*
I love him so much
Hahahhahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahjahahahahahahahahha!
There's a new Spice God in town!
4//12/2024
Conan O'Brien is a legend !
What a comedic legend!
Conan tapped into his Gene Wilder when he said he’s fine.
I haven't Laughed out loud in a long time. Thank you
Conan has clearly never even seen a clip of this show 😂
Conan is the fucken man!!!!!!!!!!!
The GOAT!
LEGENDARY! best episode ever
This might be the perfect episode.
Haven't seen this type of energy since Eric Andre
It was crazy when Sean asked Conan O'Brien, "hehn han zong gabong resident achan pong laybah?" I'm glad Conan called him out on that.
Conan would throw himself into a pool of acid-spitting sharks to make someone laugh.
23:41 Close-up shot on Da Bomb oozing out on the table while Conan waxes philosophical 😂
I knew this was gonna be a good one. I did NOT know it was gonna be this much of a masterpiece 😂
Magnificent!
Ladies and gentlemen, the most entertaining man on television.  👏👏👏👏👏
I love this man
This is the best episode I have ever seen. He is legend 🙌😂
Haven't watched this in years. I'd be shocked if this isn't the great one of these vids ever made😂
“First we feasted” hosted by Conan Obrien, featuring Conan O’brien with guest Conan O’Brien.
Always funny 😂
This was great to watch! Lol
lol
Conan is ❤
This has to be the best episode of hot ones ever made
Conan...the man....the myth
Conan is always a hoot
The subtle "feel for the pulse" and he just says "It's there" had me rolling 😆🤣
BEST ONE EVER!!! Only Conan could do it.
On one of the podcast episodes, Sona mentioned how he goes to another level when it's for a bit or on camera. I think she mentioned how it was brutally hot at some location and he just soldiered on while everyone else around him was melting.  Conan is just on another comedy plane of existence.
Best episode ever guys! Conan truly raised the bar!
Best episode ever! Conan rocks!
Truly one of a kind
Feel like sean was a bit too formulaic here. Not being able to go with the flow and improve or riff a bit. He puts a lot of time in the questions i bet. But sometimes its awkward to see conan riff or joke and instead of following up on it sean goes straight into the next question.
Yeeeeeeees! The best one yet!! Conan I LOVE YOU
Wow what a show Conan is on another level he didn't even blink with all those hot salsas he delivered a show on the level of someone like Jim Carey and Jim Carey is pretty much the benchmark for comedy right now since Robin Williams isn't here with us anymore RIP Robin, now we need the current king of comedy Jim Carey on hot ones.
Oh wow. Conan killed it. Speechless
conan got lost in the sauce… literally 😂
#1 trending in YT! Congrats guys, this one was epic😂🔥
Fudddge 😂😂😂 I haven't laughed so hard in a long time! loved the Chris Farley homage !😂 21:22
Those Dr. Arroyo bits are gold!
Conan has a talent for sticking with a bit so hard that even when it starts off not funny, it ends up funny because he just kept at it louder each time. You almost start to worry if he's actually okay, and then he pivots and drops the bit entirely.
Is the Corona era double table set up still necessary in these times? It reminds me of Putin hosting his guest on his long table keeping maximum distance. Let’s get back to single table set ups again.
Conan, what a pro!
Conan is literally the best!
BEST HotOnes Episode I’ve EVER seeeeeeen!!!! Awesome! Give him the award!
best hot ones episode of all time
Haven’t laughed this hard in a while! 😂
“I’M FINE!” 😂😂😂
That has to be fake
The goat 🐐
hands down the best episode ever.
Now we need an Andy Richter episode :3
Conan O Brian goes hard 😮.  That man slapping them wings 😂😂😂
Funny how Conan says the worst thing a guest can do is tell the audience its going well; a big part of his shtick is explaining to the audience how poorly a production his show is
Conan owns Hot One's
Comedy just isn’t as good as the Conan days anymore. Physical comedy is the best
Who wouldn't love it.... Wow... My head bows to Conan... Smart
The worst episode, can't stand this clown
Conan O'Brien gave such crackhead vibes and I LOVE ITTT
Best episode ever!!!!!!!!!!
Definitivamente es el mejor episodio! Conan es un tipazo de la comedia!
This is the greatest thing I’ve ever seen
pure comedy gold
Can someone check to see if Conans still alive.
My fav episode and guest ! 🎉😂
“Was it a four-year medical school?” “It was supposed to be.”  ::walks off::  😂😂😂
Doctor Arroyo gave me a hysterectomy and honestly im so happy about it
This man brings his writer together and does a bit! Legend!!!!!
Anyone remember Bill Murray’s speech in Scrooged. Classic
Conan is the man of the late night talk show.
When is Alex Jones gonna be on hot ones?
Is that a doctor
The best the best the best
Top Unhinged HotOnes, joining ranks of BobbyLee,and EddieHuang,
This episode made me audibly laugh out loud, you deserve the praise 💪🏼🙏🏽
Also im pretty sure Conan reads these personally: conan, reach out to me, lets meet, we will have fun: guaranteed, yiu will give me 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Conan respecting Coolio's name with this sauce performance.
110% the best episode of hot ones… way to end the season
Does Conan have covid?
“what’s wrong with me, why can’t i feel” honestly, with no context im worried about this man
Just some advice: Do NOT eat watching this episode
Epic! Not that more proof was needed, but I'm convinced Conan can do anything. He's a G.O.A.T.
Good lord! 😂
Honestly that was amazing. Sean is great, but conan shines here. This must be the top of his career, I dont know, I'm a millennial.
Man I wish sean asked some more questions, not many in depth questions he usually does. But this was still a good episode, conan always gives a good show !! He has to be mentally unstable, ADHD  LMBO  Sean really is a good host !!
Conan did a good job but let's not compare him to the greats that didn't use water or milk.
Conan was the hero we all needed
Max.... Max.... why does that sound familiar. It's Max Weinberg and the Max Weinberg 7 😂!
Conan being a talk show host for so long might be the most wasted potential in history
this one was wild!!!!! XD Conan rules!!!!!!!
This needs to win awards, im being absolutely serious.
Iconic
Conan is AN ABSOLUTE MENACE 😂😂😂😂 My God 🫡🫡🫡
*puts stethoscope on tongue*  It’s not good
god, haven't laughed this hard in a while :D
Jeez I am dying
Definitely recency bias, but in my opinion, Conan is the best guest to ever be on the show.
And here I thought I was gonna be watching Conan O'Brien eat some hot wings, not Late Night with the Devil
He went completely psychopath
this was so nicely over the top.....if they could bring back Robin Williams .....my bucket list of guest would almost be complete
Best episode ever!
watched Conan since 1996 (I was 12), he and Letterman are the only two late night talk show hosts I truly loved.  sheer mastery.
I hope he was all right after that.
Imagine Jeremy Fragrance joining this show, his insanity would be unmatched 🤣
Next time someone asks me where I got my computer science degree from I'm gonna reply back with "Um, out of state." 😂🤣
i didn’t think conan was batshit crazy but like he said no one can predict the future
Best episode by far!
I've never seen anyone dominate those wings like Conan
“What’s wrong with me, why can’t I feel…” 🎬
I'm DYING laughing. BEST Hot Ones episode ever!!
RICHARD NIXON!!! 😂 yes that would slap
Da Bomb slowly spilling while he rants about comedy made my decade.
Never in my life have I ever had more pride in being a Conan fan
Sean what shoes are you wearing in this episode
What a way to wrap up season 23!!! 🤣 Conan the great!!!!
Best Hot Ones interview ever!!!
TEAM COCO!!!!😃
I’m watching a real life Rick
Irish catholic here. My mother thinks black pepper is the spiciest thing on earth ;)
We are all so lucky to be alive for Conan bro hahahah
Conan is a total genius writer and comedian.
This can never be topped!! Conan is the GOAT
❤❤❤😂😂😂
Conan has a fear of being cloned, so is protective of his DNA...thus pocketing the bones.
Jesus H. Christ did Conan go for it!   ITS NOT A BIT!!!! 😂😂😂😂
Conan the absolute mad man I expected him to be lol. Also when the camera man started talking about sports I was fully expecting a sports gambling ad.  Thank you for not promoting bad gambling habits like many others are currently crumbling to 👍
Respectful and creating total chaos, love it!
Turns out. Cocan was luffy all along. Pocket 🍖
Hilarious!!!  Conan enriches everything... he is like the comedy spice
The sauce pouring out at the end was a paid actor. 😂
😂😂 Love him he's so funny.. Greetings from the UK
For those who don't know, Dr. Arroyo is Jose Arroyo, who was a writer for Conan on all his late night shows and it was cool to see him again being just as ridiculous as ever
7:46 Conan getting strangled by his doctor. That'll be my new wallpaper
Insane! Sean is speechless! Lol
wow
Conan needs to be the holiday 2024 guest, we need more of this!!!!!!
Conan is the best, seriously.. reward that man. I got to see him live & after the show he didn’t leave until ever single person that wanted an autograph or picture got one. Conan delivers every time. Best hot ones guest of all time.
you could have released this april 18th ; )
Too good
COOOOOOONNNNNNNAAAAAAAANNNNNNNN 😮😂
Literally one of a kind 👑
Conan has never been my cup of tea. Wasn't going to watch but I did, worst episode ever.  I just don't get it, still not funny. I know, I know unpopular opinion...... lol
They only two people who could beat that performance are Jim Carrey and Robin Williams.
The best guest ever!!!!!!
Tip your dry cleaner.
A man of infinite composure, what a treat.
Team Coco !!! Nuff said!
Since the mid-nineties when I’d stay up past bedtime to watch his and Andy’s show, I have always, and I will always, absolutely adore Conan O’Brien ❤
This interview will never be topped.
jimmy fallon next pleassse
Hands down best episode ever. Shaun and Conan delivered
The trick to authentic Irish food is to make sure you boil everything in separate pots --that way, you don't get any flavor development.
I see conan i click
Conan never disappoints to be epic! 😁😁
Conan is the funniest famous person alive
This is THE best episode ever
Noone will ever do hot ones better than this ! King Conan takes the hot ones crown
Holy god, after years of watching this show I can honestly say this is legendary. Conan's commitment to the bit is unparalleled.  Please don't invite him back. I'm now convinced he would throw himself off a cliff onto jagged rocks for a laugh. He is a treasure that must be protected from himself.
Best guest ever! Period, Conan killed it as always!
I have enjoyed all the episodes from this wonderful channel. Having said that, this one belongs in another category.
Him telling us to read the classics while he foams at the mouth 😂
Best interview yet! Top that!
8:04 - Can someone explain what's going on there? I can't quite tell who the guest is, but is that a flipped calf implant?
I never comment on these things.  Best Hot Ones ever!
Please invite Please Don’t Destroy
funniest ever 😅😅😅😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣🤣
Madman !! Genius !! What a season finalle !!
“IM DOING MY BEST TO BE ON THE SHOW THAT ALL THE YOUNG ONES WANT ME TO BE ON!!!!”
I have been waiting for this one for quite some time. It is a legendary episode. Conan takes it to the next level. Now we need Sean to be a guest on Conan needs a friend
Greatest one yet
Whoever thought of Dr. Arroyo deserves an Emmy
This is the single greatest interview of all time
Beautiful chaos 😂😂😂😂
22:04 "So you say this is pure pepper" as he proceed to eat the completely doused wing like corn on the cob Sean: Oh my god
Conan doesn’t just have cojones, he has cannonballs! 💥
he keeps saying "he's not a good doctor, he's an affordable doctor" with the subtext "he is an affordable actor who can play a comedic doctor" he is deadly serious yet completely committed to 'the bit' at the same time. absolute genius
This is some next level stuff from Conan
3rd time watching this. I want it on loop in my head for eternity.
I’m so poor, I’d pocket the chicken wings too 😭
"...cause Max rolls right off the tongue." 🤣 Conan is a legend.
like a true boston craic head, he is inexperienced with hot sauces but he just dives into it like a madman and survives. reminds me of the time I used too much (not my assessment but whatever) ghost pepper sauce and shat fire for a week
Hands down best episode ever
Pocketing the wings is an alpha move!  Edit: fully asserted his dominance over this show!
Conan really is built different. He's absolutely unforgettable!
Have always loved Conan. And this is by far my favorite episode of hot ones. He left no crumbs haha. Mad respect!
WOW, been waiting a LONG time for this episode & Conan did NOT disappoint! Both my face & stomach hurt from laughing so hard! 🤣😂😭
Conan was Conan in the best way. Will go down as one of THE best episodes.
My question to you is: how do I reincarnate as Conan O'brien?
Still the best in the business
Conan is the greatest talk show host of all time
Love this guy!
DA GOAT
He basically took over the show.....🤣🤣
This is my favourite episode of all time.
If this guy gets his own show, especially if it's a late night show. Am sure  he would be the best at it !
all hail king conan
Two of the greatest interviewers of all time
conan is a legend, literally laughed the whole time
Best Hot Ones ever????!!? this is the purest of gold
Wow!
I’ve never seen Sean so terrified in the end lol
I think this is the best episode I've ever seen of Hot Ones
Max was his band leader yo
The moment America rejected this man in favor of the snickering simpletons Leno and Fallon I knew the country was in for some hurt and it did not take long for that to come true. A national treasure who makes the US the envy of the world.
Sensational
that’s the best episode ever!!!
Haven't laughed this much in a long time, class episode
Top tier episode. Conan is awesome, they killed it this ep.
BEST EPISODE EVER!
Although not many watch you then, I still cherished the moment I hangout with you and just love your quality even as always. Btw  you steal the show and Impressive totality there.
"What can't I feel!" Lol.. Better that Ice spice
The 🐐!  🧡
Legend.
This is the funniest of all of his interviews! I am 😂😂😂😂
i think conan has covid haha how is he taking that heat
Conan bringing back the Covid scanner
Conan absolutely destroying the game and breaking the rules with those sauce shots :D
I’ve been watching hot ones for so long I LOVE the artist who did the visuals for the bull story love this show 🔥🔥
Conan brought a real life Dr. Nick Riviera
New favorite
This fu**er drank wax before this
Fñ Conan  Man hahaha  my favorite line and I still say-sing it to this day " in year 10,000 "
A legendary Hot Ones episode! Gwyneth Paltrow's dropped over 3 week's ago sitting at 1M views. Conan tackles (and bathes) in the wings of death, hitting 2.7M views in less than 24 hrs. Pure comedic gold.
Gold. Pure Gold.  🤣🤣🤣
"...can I have the same as that lady on the next table"
Best episode yet lol
I need the shade Conan’s lips turn in lipstick form
If this doesn't become the most-viewed episode of Hot Ones, I will lose my faith in humanity. Conan went all in for our viewing pleasure. What a legend.
Best episode ever!
This is literally the best episode, Conan truly is the king!
Adding this doctor bit was sooo good HAHAAJ
This is literally the best episode EVER on Hot Ones. Going to be hard to top this one ☝️
Been watching Conan from when he started  in my stoner days and I’m diggin the fact you got him on the show and he gave Sean his flowers. So dope to watch it all come together. 🎉
Conan O'Brien can make his subject to relax, but I'm certain that when pushed to be serious journalist he could grill heads of state and powerful industrialists with his thoroughness and persistence. As subject of interview he absolutely takes control and sets the pace. Absolute triumph by Conan O'Brien yet he didn't rub it in.
da bomb is the one that really scares me (and most guests).  yeah conan showed it utter disrespect and I love it lol.  tbh i put conan up there with alton brown.. both handled the spice like bosses
The maestro of madness. The king of comedy. This is Conan unhinged. Also, that Dr. looks familiar haha!
Bestest ever, no.question
I've been waiting to see someone smash it and finally it happened
Wow the GOAT
Why is it that I’m wiping my mouth??😂🤣😂 Quoting Popeye killed me😂😂This was the best!! Conan is a national treasure and I’ve missed him so much❤❤❤ Epic!!!👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🔥🔥🔥
I never requested him. Please don't have him back. Very disgusting. Worse than playing with one's food.
This feels strikingly similar to some of Robin Williams’ unhinged interviews! 😂
The audible gasp I let out
Conan is a national treasure!
Top 3 show ever. Just reached the Grohl summit with this one. He's superhuman or something.
Conan is the greatest of all time, bar none.
well holy f*ck, absolutely the best episode you've ever had here, hats off to conan for going all out there, insane!
Absolute legend!!! The ending had me crying for more than one reason.
Hilarious, one of my favorite.
The only way to make this episode better is seeing Jordan Schlansky eating some wings (He probably wouldn't feel anything)
Conan O'Brien just took the crown of Hot Ones! 👏👏👏
Oh man...this will go down as one of the legendary episodes. I couldn't stop gasping at  this spectacle 😂
Conan was unhinged, this episode was pure gold!
best episode ever! I love Conan! ❤❤
This was soooooo hilarious! 😂🤣 brilliant! 💯
He grew up in an Irish house, eh? No whiskey on this show, boyo.
Truly the best guest of all time
*(Thinking that people who didn't know Conan can enjoy his comedy now fills me with determination) I love this man so much 💖
Coco wants the power rank
God I love Conan. Dude is just so likeble.
Oh ma gaaaaaa!!!!!😂. Conan just sacrificing his colon for us!!!! He’s a giver.  I’ve immediately subscribed to Max.  Lolllllll
Literally woke up the wife to show her how he poured the last dab for our amusement.
By far one of the greatest episodes!
Conan is a goat bro❤
A true professional
That was the best thing I’ve ever watched
Can anyone tell me what jacket Conan’s wearing. That’s sharp with the red stitching.
Can we get a petition to get Bruce Campbell on hot ones
This is incredible 😂
Goat conan goat episode
That's the most entertaining descent into madness I have ever seen.
my favorite celebrity, great dude
I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time, I’m out of breath and crying. Best episode ever! And my gosh, Conan… what a champ!!
What a maniac.  The doctor bit was funny.  Anything is better than Ice Spice.
The best episode ever
This is why Conan is the best!  Absolute LEGEND !
😂 I hoped he washed his hands a million times before he tried to touch his face
Dude just GOATED himself. Absolutely incredible.
don't know how it happened but by the end of the episode Conan transitioned and became Margaret Thatcher
Best episode ever!!!!😂😂😂😂😂
Conan just reminded the world what a true comedic talent looks like. What a legendary performance.
Best Hot Ones interview EVER
I would like this twice, if I could.
Legend
NGL i actually thought he had hired a doctor to make sure he was going to be safe. Then i realized it was nothing but comedy gold 😂😅
Easily the best episode
The closing line about Sean's wardrobe was 10/10
Best episode of Hot Ones ever! 😂😂😂😂
Bro is he alive after this show 😂?
Greatest ending ever…..
host meets host
Conan to me is 2nd only to David Letterman, who I would also love to see on this show.
He broke our Sean.
Wow😅
I’ve never watched a hot ones episode so many times in 24 hours. This is the most hilariously unhinged interview I’ve ever seen. 😂
Conan turned into Lewis Black at the end of that interview
nobody can top conan
Great interview as always, but please get rid of the 2 tables for next season. I really hate that you guys sit at 2 different tables opposite of each other, so odd...I much prefer a more intimate setting on one table, like normal people, even if it's a kinda large table.
Conan is a mad man I love it
What a masterpiece of an episode. Conan is unmatched.
Denis Villeneuve missed out on casting Conan as a Harkonnen.
Ofcourse Conan has the most entertaining hotones ep ever!
😂😂😂😂😂
I've wanted to see Conan on Hot Ones for years, but I NEVER would have expected him to effortlessly dominate the wings.Dude is an absolute beast!
LEGENDARY EPISODE!!!
Conan's performance in this episode should be studied like one of those breakdown videos *pause* "Notice how Conan introduces his character's premise at 0:49"
21:00 Conan has a Harvard degree
BYE BYE. THIS IS THE BEST HOT ONES EPISODE EVER !
I miss Conan!! 😂😂😂
What a legend!
Conan rules! Has been the talk show host staple since the 90’s.
Best episode ever
Beat Episode Ever.
I have not been this happy in a long while, I really do miss Conan in his old format he is just mind blowingly awesome
❤
The hardest I’ve ever laughed at a hot ones episode
What a legend
Conan just raised the bar for Hot Ones to a whole new level.
"CALL THE WIFE!" absolutely murdered me
Conan is a God 😅
Profound, hilarious, and absolutely unhinged...classic Conan. Great episode Sean!
L E G E N D !
Haha Conan is amazing.  100% Legend
"What's wrong with me? Why can't I feel?" - best line. Classic Conan.
best ever!
Best episode
I’m can confidently say that this is the best episode of Hot Ones. Taking the throne from Gordon Ramsay. Conan will never disappoint.
😂 best episode to date! I’m crying from laughing so hard 😭😂
Coco is like 99% Irish, they have a ambulance running outside the studio.😆
I want that water buffalo footage
This episode was the best 😂😂
I'd like to see Leno top this
Maybe the best Hot Ones ever.  Conan gets it. 😂
Oh my... Conan is back
WHY CANT I FEEL!!?? he exclaims as his face and eyes are red and he’s sweating 😅
This is the best interview ever
Can I schedule an appointment with Dr. Arroyo?
I was truly scared for Conan going into this one!🙂❤
Most fun I’ve had watching Hot Ones, and that speaks volumes. I love each and every episode. I won’t soon forget this one. Maybe next season you could get Axl Rose. He’s done too few interviews in his career.
Someone needs to interview Sean about this episode
That was the greatest episode i've ever seen.
Conan attacked those wings like a Viking berserker 😳
He should be your future president
who is that guy at 8:07 and can i watch that interview on youtube
23:03 somebody please make this into a gif
I hope he has more than 4 years left
Obnoxious overrated clown!
Amazing commitment from Conan. Masterclass, and hilarious to the end. “Used to be called HBO, but that was too popular,” got me.
Can't wait for his show
Conans always been my favorite. Hes hilarious
2 million In 2 days
Conan later projectile vomited on the host
Dr. Arroyo needs to be hired full-time.
My favorite part was calling Leno “The other guy” 😂😂😂
NBC remains to this day reeling over the loss of Conan. Never before was a bag fumbled more.
Conan O'Brien will always be the funniest man alive to me. Always.
I wonder which one hurt Conan more — the spicy wings or Mr. Lee’s body scrub 😂
Conan is clearly hallucinating at the end! HAHAHAHAHA!!! Love that man! he is a lagend!!!!   🤣
now thats a season ender!
conan eating like a toddler
conan killed this
That was probably the BEST episode ever. What an entertainer!!!
Wouldn't expect anything less from Conan what a freaking legend 😂
This is absolutely hands down the most hilarious episode of hot ones ever created. The greatest thing on the internet
Funniest and most impressive episode I’ve seen in a really long time 😂
The greatest episode ever!
The host is taking it too seriously.
The spice flows through him
ONE OF THE BEST, IF NOT, THEE BEST!!!
He's a mad lad for sure.
The best I've ever seen. (After Jose Antontio)
I usually end up liking the guest more by the end. Not this time around.
Now THIS is a finale!
Lol
The best hot ones yet
Conan is a master)
Love love love to conan!!! Man what an amazing funny wonderful guy
Conan 👑
😂Best episode yet so far. Having comedians on is a great idea. Can we all just appriciate the years of irreverent madness that Conan the 100% irishman blessed us with since the 90s? I've been watching him since the first days of his late night show. Madness and greatness
Conan being Conan! 😂 Possibly the best guest you’ve ever had
PURE GOLD...ACTUALLY DIAMOND....
Guy's insane
That was downright psychotic and I loved every second of it.
One of the best. Conan knows how to up the anty. love that man
Yeah that didn’t go how I thought it was going to go 😅 And I am ashamed of not believing in Conan’s super abilities to over come pain for comedy’s sake 😂
That. Was. Legendary.
He's either the greatest guest ever and gave an absolute masterpiece of a performance OR he did waaay too many drugs before doing it.
This went from complimenting to UNHINGED reeeeeal quick!....ahahahahahahaha Great episode!!
Already need Conan to return to Hot Ones and it’s only been one day.
Let’s make this the most popular video on the channel guys!
23:17 - 23:37 somehow the bottles go from being upright to had fallen down LOL
Already need Conan to return to Hot Ones and it’s only been one day.
I think this is what Freud called sublimation: taking what very well could have been severe mental illness or a substance abuse problem and turning it into pure, alchemical gold.
Sometimes is a fine line between self destruction and comedy 😂
Conan is the greatest tv personality ever!
Only Conan could have pulled this off 😂👏👏
I literally snarfed drinking my water when he started licking da bomb sauce going insane and Sean getting fearful for him.
We all speculated for the longest time that conan would have a hard time on this show but man oh man, he crushed it like a mf.. GOAT episode from the GOAT
Conan is one crazy MF lol but this was the best episode of Hot Ones I've ever seen!!!!! Also I don't think Sean asks great questions, they're just so random and unimportant...
27 minutes of why Conan will always be the best host of late night television. He gives all of himself every time for the audience.
Conan is just the best ever PERIOD.
Absolute legend
His improvise skills are beyond the world. That's why he's considered by many to be the greatest late night host.
one of the best interviews. what a way to end a season. conan is goated.
I admire a guy who hosts hot ones and wear beautiful suede 😂
GOAT
Conan is the 🐐. Yeah I said it
Is he on something? This is inhuman
Why does Conan look like an Irish Arnold. 😂
This episode has reset the bar.  Conan is an absolute legend!  Best episode ever, and there have been some good ones. I broke a sweat watching this, and have tears rolling down my cheeks from laughing. The world needs more of this man!
I've been watching this since they had less than a million subscribers. To see how far this show has come is a real testament to the one true attribute you need in life. Nothing can beat  Good old persistence. TheFounder 📽️
RIP
Best guest of the season
Omfg, that was just the best!! Conan, you a f’n legend!!
Best Episode  Period. Konan Rules!
This is the best thing I have seen since Teresa flipped that table. LOL!!!
Not sure how any future guest could top Conan.
Is Conan the first guest to bring a character with him
This was the best interview ever.
Great episode, Conan is brilliant as always! Would have loved to see this without the tiresome background music...
Living Legend . This man shaped all of our humor with his work on The Simpsons.
That was incredible!!! God bless Conan!!!
Best of hotwings and best of Conan combined!
Conan the mfn Barbarian has arrived 😂
This show is not going to be the same after this 😂
conan is the best !
Best episode ever. Freaking legend
Best one yet!
That must have been the best episode in the history of hot ones.
The greatest thing ever!
Most chaotic and entertaining episode of Hot Ones 🙌 Conan you're a legend
This was the best hot ones episode ever.
*HOT POCKETS!*
I love Conan so much. It would make me so happy if a new generation discovered him.  If you’re too young to know, please search up his remote/travel segments on YouTube. The man is a national treasure.
Doing a deranged monologue with drool and wing sauce all over his face, with wing bottles sprawled all over the table. This is everything I could have hoped for and more. Bravo
Great show, don't say it's a bit, killed the mood
Literal outbursts of laughter and horror lol Conan never misses. I hope they talk about this on the podcast because I need to know if he violently throws up afterwords - there's just no other way. Best way to end the season Hot Ones team!
Comedic genius! 👏🏻 👏🏻
My goodness!! This is by far the best episode, we'll... After Dave Grohl That is
Favorite guest !!!!
"I would look out and see 200 souls leaving 200 bodies"  Huh - must not have had any redheads in the audience.
Now thats how you get interviewed!
Conan is a comedic genius.
Greatest episode ever with the greatest showman ever!
Conan is off the chain unhinged 😂 I've always enjoyed him though. Good one
Best Hot Ones ever!! Conan is the Goat!
G.O.A.T
This has to be a contender for the best show ever.
Incredible episode😂
An instant classic episode
I think Sean is scared lol such a sweet boy
My favorite Hot Ones eposibde ever!
one of the greatest guests on this show! GGs Conan GGS!!!!!!
Get Conor McGregor on hot ones 😂
Im a legend!!!
Use this as an I love Conan O’Brien button
I just realized that, completely by accident, I'm eating the garlic Hot Ones tenders while I'm watching this 😂
Definitely have not laughed this hard at a hot ones episode before, crying 😂
#1... That is all.
I yams what I yams
I need to know if Conan had to lay down in an office afterwards like Coolio did
Would it be considered animal abuse, if you gave your left over hot wings to a dog? Asking for a friend. Conan O'Brien.
This is the best episode in all of Hot Ones history. Incredibly fun man, Conan.
Wish Jordan was there to comment... just sayin
I don’t know how Sean can just play it off so cool, I LOVE CONAN way too much and would not be able to contain myself just being able to interview him. He’s no doubt my fav human being all time. Thank you for brining Conan. You guys really knocked it out park this one. 2M view in just 1 Day
I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard. Thank you Conan
That was barbaric the way Conan dumped da bomb on his wing. I guess you could say he's a barbarian and his name is Conan... Conan the barbarian is a pretty cool dude , bro.
23:00 "I'm Fine!!" 😂😂😂😂
Sean had fear in his eyes.
Conan is wild man 😂 Absolutely burning his pale irish bones at the alter of First we feast.
New favorite episode
Conan stashing wings in his pocket- Classic!😂
Haven't laughed this much on a hot ones ep in a while
The GOAT
Of all the greats, this is the best Hot Ones ever.
Fake.
Conan is the best
Conan is the best, always funny
So good! You can tell he enjoyed himself
Conan finally showing some color on his face 😂
There will never be a better episode than this episode!
Has anyone checked up on Conan? I'm afraid his innards won't ever be the same
0:40 This will not end well.
I don't want to sound mean and I love Conan. He does seem to be a little Trump like, is his face a little orange?? Seems to be too much makeup...
I love super hot spice and I’m still unsure how he did this
10:41 whoever came up with the idea of adding cartoons is a genius!! XD XD XD
Conan is one of the good ones.
That last speech that Conan gave about reading comedy and all of that reminded me of the last speech performed by Charlie Chaplin in the movie The Great Dictator.
Conan is HIM!
This is hands down the best episode of hot ones!
Conan handling the sauces like a champ! It must be that red headed Irish part of him that helps 😂 love you Conan!
Conan      THE ABSOLUTE BEAST   !!!!!!!!   Amazing  !!!!!
how would the next person to come on the show even top Conan O'Brien.....OG killed that
Poor Sean got roped into the excess and they didn't even show him on camera, but he still had to suffer the consequences!
I feel bad for the season 24 guests. That all have to follow this.  And I’m not sure there is someone that can. Challenge submitted!
Why did I even question whether or not Conan would be the goat guest?  Goat talk show host, goat hot ones guest.
Wing drop 😤
I was expecting a little more from Conan, more action or something. Said noone.
Name names please
Now we wait for a new season.
This was way more unhinged than I could have imagined 😂😂😂 did not disappoint
Some clean that man’s face
I appreciate his over the top attempt but it's a bit too much.
👏👏👏👏👏👏 the new GOAT is Conan.
Protect Conan at all costs!
Conan should know it's not the "going in" that he has to worry about
Wow!😂
Conan O' Brien telling Sean he thinks he's a great interviewer has to be the highest compliment he can get.
Proof yet again that Conan a genius and that red heads have a pain tolerance that the rest of us commenters can’t begin to understand.
Oh my goodness, this was madness!
Best episode ever , Conan is a madman
Amazing. Conan dropped another classic.
hahaha conan <3
Legend
What a legend had me cackling
No one will have the nerve to talk about him not cleaning the wings because conan is above hate
I've never. This man. Conan. The greatest ever.
Conan gave us a small glimpse into who he is and how he became one of the most famous talk show hosts in the world.
Gingers feel no pain
Nooooooooooo it's not gonna stop 😂
In typical Conan fashion, he ends up with hot sauce clown makeup. Great episode.
The ending was great!
I was literally asking him to stop through the monitor, like the old school horror movies where you really knew they shouldn’t do something and yet he did it! This is Conan! ❤
What a genius
High praise from Conan. I think Sean is possibly the best interviewer in the game, and finally someone like Conan stated it. Love this show.
Best episode ever, no competition. I cried laughing through most of the episode
I feel like Sean looked the happiest in this episode more so than any other
Conan transforming to FULL-CONAN mode just brought me to tears ❤️❤️❤️ Thank you for giving your all in everything you do and making everything perfect, Conan!
Best episode ever, thanks :)
This is the best episode yet imo!
22:05 you can hear the crew laugh in the background :D
Anyone else think it’s weird that he wanted to hold onto the bones?
Best, Guest, EVER by far, Conan is the G.O.A.T.
This was hilarious, but I would caution others to not watch over breakfast 🤢
"He's not a good doctor...he's an affordable "😂😂
Conan will do ANYTHING for the bit.
Conan is a legend.
LOVE THIS SHOW!! Can we see the after show on that one? It might be better than this episode and this is one of the best!
CONAN IS A GOD
Why is Conan insane there? I'm scared for him.
21:17 Gold. Absolut gold. 🤣
God bless Conan.
Best episode of the series by far.
Okay Conan scares me. He literally feels no pain. He should fight aliens for us. What a LEGEND.
The best yet
He ATE
if you ever wondered how Conan would sound as our dictator/fearless leader.
That shot at the end where Conan is speaking and the bottle of Da Bomb is rhythmically leaking out just looked so poetic.
Conan brought so much fun and sincerity to this. An incredible interview!
Sponsored by Tavel Texas? A place where human rights have less importance than guns? No thank you, it’s run by psychopaths.
The shot with the spilled hot sauce oozing out while Conan is covered in sauce going on his unstable motivational speech was like watching the birth of a child. You’re horrified but it’s the most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen.
Sean absolutely lost control of Conan and it turned into one of the best episodes of the entire series, on par with Gordon Ramsay. Conan is a legend
Absolutely freaking incredible performance
Conan confirmed his status as the King!
Conan - "You can't predict the future." 5 min earlier "I give it 4 years top"
Holy cow he took a shot of the last dab LOL
Absolute god, you go coco
Man I miss conan…
You didn't bring Jordan Schlansky😂
i had the absolute privilege to talk to Conan for 17 minutes back in 2021 on his Conan O'Brien Needs A Fan segment, and oh boy does this make me happy. he truly is the GOAT, make no mistake!
Man, he radiated more energy in 25 minutes than I've done in 25 years.
"Feel for a pulse" "It's there" 😅
Icon
"I'm an irish man who's never seen spice" Paul Atreides before arriving in Dune
CONAN YOURE THE MANNNNNNN
Did he pull a homer a drink candle wax before this to safeguard his mouth?
this just plain and simple can not be topped
Not one of the better episodes in my opinion. The outlandish behavior was not entertaining to me.
I can’t with Conan! 😂😂😂😂😂 Bravo to both!
In a way, it's weirdly inspiring. It's just pain (and maybe ulcers...). If you believe in yourself and are strong mentally you can accomplish whatever you want. Even hot wings.
What a legend
best episode ever!
BEST HOT ONES EVER!!
O my goodness😮 wat did I just witness🙈🙈
Conan killed Bea Arthur. Confirmed.
THE GOAT
"you say this is pure pepper?" ROFL
Geez dude!
IF YOU DON'T LOVE CONAN, YOU NEED TO MOVE TO ANTARCTICA AND LEAVE EVERYONE ALONE!
23:00 When anybody asks how I'm doing in life
It was an interesting interview where he was constantly slipping in and out of the "bit". Half the time trying to play it up as the jester and then just being a real person giving a real answer (this part I liked much better). Great compliment about Sean's interviewing skills and dedication.
They were getting so predictable and boring. Thank you Conan…❤
Man, that's gonna be one rough dump!
So unhinged. 😂
Conan still one of the best talk show host there ever was. The way he makes people laugh everywhere he goes is something you don't see too often. So happy to see him in this show
This one is going to be hard to top
Best episode yet!
Incredible. Bravo, Conan.
I almost Barfed towards the End, WORTH IT Best Episode EVER
Great Mother Mary Magdalene! This episode was hilarious! Conan is a comedic genius!
Conan!!!! Lets goooo! My favourite comedian. Right after Leslie Nielsen :3
There is absolutely nobody more committed than Conan.
How is this video not at 100 million already?
I now have a new level of respect for the man a truly wowing performance knows how to work the room
Came for the laughs and left feeling inspired lol Classic Conan
We need extended cut / bloopers for this episode … I am sure there is more of Dr arrayo bits  …
Conan killed Bea Arthur. 😂😂 RIP Bea
Best episode ever!!
Conan... You have my respect sir!
@teamcoco this man is a Legend!
I have been waiting YEARS watching this show for someone to add hot sauce to wings other than the last dab (I don't count Shaq's hot sauce medley on his final wing since he didn't even eat it), specifically Da Bomb. A little over the top theatrics, but that's just Conan. Respect for the extra sauce on Da Bomb
Greatest episode and guest ever, Conan is a masterclass in the interview process. Also, did not expect him to demolish those wings like he did, thats the Late Night Gods protecting him 🔥
23:49 camera guy  or editor deserve an award for this specific shot
lol so unhinged how
Conan was just built for stuff like this, even if he claims to not have spice tolerance.  Everything he touches is gold.
The red hair makes him fire proof
He’s got about 4 years to live.   The GOAT
I've watched every episode of Hot Ones, this is the first episode that I felt i HAD to comment. This was absolutely incredible and Conan is and will forever be one of the legends of comedy. He is as relevant now as he always was, and I feel so happy that Sean got the chance to receive what I am sure was some of the highest praise imaginable. Perfection!
Conan's hilarious. Stuffing the wings in his pockets for later! lol This was a great episode, and Conan is off the chain!
This is the best video I've ever seen. Literally we all love Sean for his interviewing skills, and have been watching for years. Conan to talking about him like that was so awesome. Hilarious, yet so informative and inspiring, this video is the epitome of why we love these 2.
…is this a cry for help?
The best episode Conan is my fav person ever
I've watched a ton of these I think that was my favorite.  And the fact that he's the whitest, most Irish guest to date and handled it like that was truly impressive.  I want to know what his detox protocol was.  Conan is amazeballz.
Conan verbalized my exact thoughts when HBO Max turned into Max 😂
This is unironically one of the best episodes ever. From both a comedic and informative standpoint. Conan was an immaculate guest and showman. Excellent job, everyone!
Talk about hitting it out of the park … Conan set a new bar for how to eat wings on this show
Conan is like 70 and still has the energy of a 5 year old high on sugar. I'm not even 30 and feel like any day now I'm just gonna pass away in my sleep.
U N H I N G E D
Love Conan. This was amazing.
Lol the experience is nowhere close to 2 million Scovile units.  I've had it, its not bad, its been tested to only be like 60K.  what a joke
Hands down, the FUNNIEST episode of HotOnes by a long shot! 😂  Conan is the GOAT. 31 y/o, been watching him nearly every night since before “In the year 2000” bit. Love the man and love HotOnes lol
2nd now after STEVE O ....
Wings in the pocket😂 loved this one
I didn't see this coming, best episode ever!!!
My love for Conan O’Brien knows no bounds
I just gotta love Sean and Conan synergy. in my book these two persors set the the bar how things should be done when interviewing persons.
This is one of the most legendary videos I've ever seen.
The GOAT!
This. Was. Magnificent.
Gross... and funny!😂
I've just witnessed peak Conan.
Sean and Conan both DELIVERED. Mostly Conan. :) Who even saw this energy coming?! Unreal.. This is to us all! This one will be VERY HARD to top.. Thanks, weird and old Wendy's girl.. :)
Conan goes hard in the paint.
He deserves a framed picture in the studio
Conaaaaan!!!!
CALL THE WIFE HAHAHA
Yeah, this episode was incredible lol.
His skin had the same color as donald trump after he finished the last one
Absolutely the best
I don't know how they got Conan O'Brien on the show?!?? BUT this is the best show ever!!! <3 11/10!
Conan who once had an on set injury that resulted in a hematoma so large he to get his pants cut off, decades later, goes on Hot Ones and slays. Once again he has to be cut out of his pants.
20:55 this is the funniest ep ever
You did it, you got the GOAT himself!
Crazy bustard 😂😂❤😂❤
This was the funniest thing 🤣 😂 💀 😭 😆 😄 🤣 😂 💀  I've seen in a long time 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
best episode ever, no debate possible
Hahahahaha😂 He really rubed it in in to he's ripples 😂😂😂😂
Hahahahah😂 He really robbed
I think this is exactly how Warren G Harding went out
WHY IS HE SO UNHINGED HAHAHAHA
Funniest episode ever.
Best Late night showhost ever and by far
Conan is the real deal. He's given his all for the show and his fans, even when we didn't deserve it!  I knew if he ever did Hot Ones, it would be among the best episodes.  By the end he has so much burning sauce on his mouth, he looks like Klaus Kinski at the end of Crawlspace, and ranting like Nicholas Cage doing a monologue. Sean definitely deserves much praise for making this stuff happen...Epic.
Sad to see you so distant from each other. Makes no sense and ruins immersion.
🐐
The true king!
Conan is the fking GOAT !!
I’d love to see his face in an hour later revisit. 😂
The chokehold Conan O’Brien has on me. I had a crush on him like the chick from Sugar and Spice.
OH MY GOD!  That was EASILY the GREATEST, MOST INSANE episode of Hot Ones ever!
That was the best episode of the entire series. The wait for Conan was absolutely worth it.
ouch
What an absolute legend
Finally
So, Conan killed Bea Arthur?!
Conan O'Brien should be a playable character in Mortal Kombat.
Conan has a high spice tolerance.
This is definitely on my top 3. Now I have to pick the other 2.
What is the point of being live if we can't do this?!!
Why does Conan remind me of Jerma
I am genuinely concerned for him. Has anyone checked on Conan lately?
I love Conan so much.
He’s the modern day Carson. The king of talk shows.
That was by far the best episode I have ever seen. Absolutely amazing
Such pure chaotic energy. Probably greatest episode of all time
He killed the wings and seemed nice enough to Sean to complimenting his interviewing skills. But I just don’t love this guys sense of humor. He just seems a tad obnoxious and like he tries too hard to be funny
You know I grew up watching Conan. He was always my favorite late I host because he shows the importance of commitment to what you're doing. I'm laying here in bed with a bruised rib. Laughing so hard. I can't breathe. This probably is my favorite hot ones episode. I don't see how anything else could top it that Dave grhole was but I think this one will be a favorite for a while. Mad respect
That has to dethrone whoever is at number 1 in the hall of fame, right?!
Conan is so underrated, grateful he & Jon Stewart are back. The wings in his coat, Dr. Arroyo, the water buffalo story, how he just calls Leno "the other guy" lol Conan is an underrated legend. When Conan starts laughing & Sean starts hiccuping is peak comedy
Conan is simply the talk show GOAT. No-one preceding or succeeding him comes close.
Sean didn’t need to interview Conan needed to interview Sean
You can feel the reverence. Sean is much quieter than usual.
Best episode by a mile. Conan is out of his gourd. Love it.
Cinema
I think he was really channelling the spirit of Robin Williams near the the end there lol.
This was a Masterclass in comedy
Best f**king episode EVER!!!!!!😂😂
"I don't fear you wings man". The way he said it had me dying.
This is just sooooo funny😂😂😂 the commitment is not only admirable but makes it so much funnier
Is this the greatest Hot Ones ever?
This man is insane 🤣 #1 guest!
I´ve never been much of a Conan fan, but this is one of the best shows. Congrats guys.
Epic
Arguably my fav ep
the end was a Rick & Morty ending
Not gonna lie, I did not expect Conan to be as crazy or even crazier than Eric Andre.
Why can’t I feel?! 😆
Sean, I think it's time to stop making Hot Ones. Cause this was the greatest and funniest episode and nothing will ever top this. Conan is my personal hero, so seeing him in one of my favorite talk show was such a treat. So happy to see him get appreciated even in 2024. He is the goat.
He probably took inspiration from his old pal Homer and drank candlewax before the cameras started rolling x)
The best
Fantastic
You can't just invite Conan without expecting him to also bring his own show. Top notch.🤣
Best guest ever
#1!! No other episode comes close!
This episode is going down in the history as the greatest episode on Hot Ones. No one is ever going to best it. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, Conan one ups it. Pure madness.
THIS IS MAAAAD IM SOO HAPPY
He is so funny
by far the best hot ones episode
We're these really sauced? How is he doing this 😅
THE SPICE KING HAS GIVEN HIS OFFERING!!!
Rudd has been dethroned.
He is a true legend 🤣🤣
I bet he feels the burn on the toilet later. Lol
AMAZING EPISODE!
This could have been best one
Best Hot Ones episode yet!
Literally one of the best
BRING CONAN BACK TO LATE NIGHT! He’s the best!!
RELEASE THE WATER BUFFALO FOOTAGE.
If Conan was my relative I would be the happiest person on the planet. Even if I never got a single birthday gift. 😁
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
What on earth?! Wing nine slathering on the nips is by far the best of the best I’ve ever seen on this show. Had to watch twice. I take a bow to Conan and every other guest you’ve ever had on this show should do the same. WOW. Sending this to all my friends who did the whole lineup with me a couple of years ago. THIS IS GOLD!! So redeemed yourself from the Ice Spice tragedy lol
Conan is right, as a man in his mid-30s, I would weep with joy if I met him.
CONAN!!! I love him 😊
LOOOOL that ending was shambolic- the saliva and milk coming back up and dripping down his face while he continues to rant. Absolutely FOUL but so good.
Best episode in a long time. Feels like the 1st few seasons
I've never found Conan funny, never. I guess we have a different sense of humor. Best chili peppers eater though.
He was too calm toward the end lol this man died on the toilet
I would love to see Jeremy Clarkson on this show. That, would be hilarious
This will never be topped
DaBomb is Conan O'Brian best friend! 😂
Now that Conan came on with bits, I'm now going to be disappointed when every other guest doesn't have funny bits in their literal pockets. Also, easily the best episode.
@17:23  Sean hiccuping is incredible
The animatic of the water buffalo attack is chef's kiss perfection ❤
Well Done Conan. Your Awsome Man 😃
best one🤣🤣
after this he was rushed to the hospital 🚑
easily one of the best episodes of the show. conan is truly a force to be reckoned with in show business.
Peak internet. The fact that the two best interviews I've enjoyed are Conan and Paul Rudd is no coincidence.
Most epic one everrrrr
I saw people talking about this on Reddit and was surprised I missed it — didn’t realize it was yesterday!
This is the most insane episode ever, Conan is the GOAT
Whoa insanely strong
🤣😎👍
I'm in tears over here!  This was incredible.
That exit speech was absolutely beautiful. I hope Conan goes on Rogan too. I can only imagine what kind of treasures will unfold in 3 hours
No way hes sober
One of the best Hot Ones interviews EVER! It's not easy to phase Sean, but you could tell he was shook by Conan's antics. Conan took it like a champ!
I really didn't think that Conan would be my all time favorite Hot Ones guest
This will be a hard one to beat
Congrats on probably the greatest episode to date. Of course it'd be Conan O'Brien.
BEST EPISODE EVERR
I’m dying 🤣
I have never laughed so hard at a hot ones episode, best one ever!!!!!
Serial Killer style...!!! 😂
Conan is one of the greatest.
Conan O Brien will forever be my favorite of all time -  "wing drop"
10000000/10 THE BEST EPISODE I HAVE SEEN
I like how Conan dressed the same way Bill Burr was dressed, when he was on the show. Two gingers being long distance brothers
The best guest ever.
That was probably by far the most exciting episode. How lovely!
This is the least falsely obnoxious I've seen Conan in years, if not decades. Sean's questions are needlessly said, always excellent, and Conan's answer are just outstanding. The insight given on his talk show tactics were fascinating. This interview will be relevant and enjoyed for a long, long time. The balance of insight and comedy. A+++++ seller. Thanks for this.   X  @nchalantnuance
Conan jumped the shark a bit in this episode, trying way too to get a laugh and a reaction.
Conan obrien is simply the best who ever did it.
Conan just took it to a hole new level 🎶of confidence and power 🤘🏽🎶
This is an instant classic!!
Best episode ever... by far... absolutely legendary
He's easily #1
Wow! Max! Thanks   The life, wi...fi!
Does Sean have a masterclass on interviewing? If not, why?
17:13 is my favorite part: "This one..I'm not gonna lie, I'm feeling it a little bit"
Aww, Conan episode and Finland gets mentioned. How sweet. (Torille, toverit).
Saw this episode had come out this morning, made my day immediately and could not wait to watch, but now after seeing this: epic, Conan won the hot ones, no one will ever top this 😅
such a smart funny man .shame on the business for how theyve treated him
Funniest episode ever.
Conan O'Brien Can't Stop
🐐
My theory is that Conan actually has a neurological disorder and can’t even taste the heat of spicy foods.
This....this is gold. This is pure gold.
I’m in tears by far the best episode this season. For season 25 can we have a season dedicated to some of the best guest over the past 25 seasons. I would love to see some classic guest return for another episode !
BEST EPISODE EVER
Dr. Tooth? PH? “Cranberry Sauce” - This bugs me
Conan is an absolute legend.
I don't know how many of you out there have actually tried Da Bomb or The Last Dab, but as an idiot who has purchased them and tried them, it blows my mind how Conan managed to pull that off.  It's like pouring battery acid on your tongue.  He ended up channeling Bill Murray from 'Scrooged' in his final speech.... just unbelievable.  Conan is the King of Hot Ones.
SPIKE LEE!!! BAMBOOZELED!!
23:06 Unexpected appearance of Mr. Poopybuthole from Rick and Morty. He sounds and acts exactly like him here
Chaotic Evil and lawful Neutral
this episode is so chaotic😭 i LOVE it
legend, considering watching his special on MAX, liked him before, love him now He's just phenomenal !
I will NEVER tire of Conan.
EPIC! ...And now my favorite episode.
Wow! This was a gem. Literally the best episode* 🔥🔥🔥
HAHAHAH I've never laughed this hard at any Hot Ones and maybe never laughed this hard, ever? Is Conan ok??
I love that Sean keeps trying to actually have an interview, and Conan just keeps ratcheting up the insanity.
Delete YouTube we've peaked
Licking Da Bomb?! What a savage!!
By far the best and the worst episode at the same time 😂 good god, is this entertaining!!!!
Conan the Destroyer (of Hot Sauce)
Wing drop > mic drop
Whats up with the inspirational music in the background lol
Conan has blown up the format.  He's the man.
This is the wildest episode in a long while
I was really amused, but then Conan being 60 and downing bottles of hot sauce makes my stomach burn. And I'm half his age!
Best episode so far
Get Greg Davis and Alex Horne from "Taskmaster" to do this together. It'd be incredible.
Chaos. Pure chaos.
The best one ever
Why are the first four like nothing. It’s not fun
1st time I've ever watched content back to back to marvel in the humanity
He's kinda got the dr. disrespect energy when he bursts out about the wings
❤
Another legend on the show
Conan O' Great one :)
Long live Conan, the wing king!
Feels like the first A list person we've seen on the show in years
just wow
I've never laughed so hard during a Hot Ones episode. Conan is an absolute legend.
Best episode. @23:43 - An untethered Conan waving around pure pepper during his read high and low diatribe, as the camera pans to a spilling bottle of  Da Bomb. That was a hot one
I have no words. When he got to “Da’Bomb” I went “Ah hubris, thy name is… not Conan”  Honestly, I pity his plumber tomorrow.
This and Bob Odenkirk are on completely different ends of the spectrum but they’re both my favorite episodes.
I just seen the short posted of this and this looks so wild.
The title is misleading  Also not 😉
classic
Conan is the elite of the elite
In the end Sean looks TERRIFIED. 😂😂😂😂😂
I’m gonna have to watch this about 199 more times 😂😂😂😂😂 the legend the icon Conan ❤❤❤❤
Oh my god divine moments of truth ,,what an episode conan rules
You can tell Conan was a writer for futurama with the Nixon bit.
This is one of the funniest things I have seen in a long time. 10/10, Conan.
This was the first and only episode of season 23 that I watched. I was NOT disappointed! Conan is the king! 🤣
“But I also said there’s no way there was ever gonna be a Charlie Rose show where you eat hot wings” 💀 that’s exactly what Hot Ones is 😂
There will never be a better episode of Hot Ones. This was the mashing of my two favorite shows, and it did not disappoint. Thank you to everyone involved.
Nothing can top this.
CONAN🐐🐐🐐
I have never laughed as hard as I did watching this episode.
This might be my favorite episode of Hot Ones ever 🤣🤣❤️  I love Conan!
Nothing will top this Episode. Lets see if any of the current lineup of cringe Daily talk show hosts can match the showmanship and class of Conan on Hotones
Masterclass performance by Conan
His commitment to bits has reached his peak right here. I'm sure after this, he went into a cold dark corner and cried.  And then cried on the toilet later.
This is the best episode! Hands down Conan is an absolute legend!
Epic! Best one yet!
This is Conan at his chaotic best haha by far my favorite hot ones ever. Conan is the true GOAT of late night.
Conan may just be the most charismatic person on the planet
The other guy 😂😂 we know who that other guy is 6:37
Conan owned this episode
what a legend
Conan, jesus—I’ll watch your show man! 😅
This has to be the BEST episode. ALL BECAUSE OF CONAN.
Interview After:  "The problem with me is if I think something is funny I will keep doing it and suffer later."  - Conan you absolute showman.  One of the best comedians of all time.
Bless America. And bless the American comedian.
Can't laugh hard enough!
Best interview in history. No interview can possibly ever top this.
My quick glance said “Trump”
Is this why Conan doesn't do drugs? What a legend
That was incredible😂
I love the little story about Bailey the 77-year-old cameraman. It's little human thigns like that that really make me enjoy these interviews~
Best guest to do it yet, Conan is an absolute legend for this
I love Conan. Best episode of Hot Ones ever and it's not even close.
One of the best episodes ever. Probably my favorite since, Key and Peele? This guy gets it.
Well earned praise for Mr Evans.
LEGEND
Only episode where Sean didn't mention last dab because Conan started the dabs long back. LEGEND
No way he did that 🙆🏽‍♂️😂
BRAVOOOOOOO 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 THIS WAS STELLAR 😂
How is Sean not dying in laughter each time Conan puts a wing in his pocket?
Wait till da bomb
... I don't think I've seen a guest chug the hot sauce before (around 14:10)
All hail the king of Hot Ones - Conan
That’s why Conan is number one!!!!😅😅😅😅
That was hilarious! I’ve seen every episode and I’ve never laughed so hard.
G.O.A.T
He’s not afraid to do anything for a laugh
Conan is GOATED
Perfect lol
I lost it when he wouldn't shut up at the end "Wise words from a wise and stable man --"  "YES, a MAN WHO's DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN - to Be on...the SHOWW"
I hope he ruined that jacket with his shrapnel.  I hate it more every time I see it.
I have to think he premeditated his craziness because he knew Sean would make a great unwitting straight-man to contrast with it.
End the show. This can't be topped.
Jesus H. Christ.
Conan O'Brien is a national treasure
I have watched Conan for the last 20 years. He never ceases to impress me. What a great showman.
Conan what a national legend
*Conan, hunched over like Gollum and dripping mucus with hot sauce bottles strewn across the table* "What's funnier than Don Quixote? Sancho Panza? This is good stuff."
Once in few seasons, a guest comes and changes the course of this show. Lorde,Gordon Ramsay and now the freakin' legend Conan.  P.S. Putting Lorde might be controversial i understand ,but for me she was the first guest I saw remaining unflinched by daBomb🔥
23:00 needs to be a meme 😂😂😂
Funniest one so far
I can't believe what I just saw. No one did it better.
I kept wiping my own mouth at the end.
They gotta cast Conan as Rick in Rick and Morty one day.
i love this man, he is the best
I think there's actually people with genes that can't detect spice but either way whatever is coming out of his stomach has to hurt lol
Honestly this reminds me of gene wilder
His composure...amazing. he must have been in so much pain. Crazy
Conan is the best😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yo Max, you guys need to green light season 2 of Conan’s travel show. We need him back here asap! I’m in tears… By far the best episode. Could only be better if you get both Conan and Kevin.
Conan O’Brien is the man. 👏
Absolutely the best, funny, outrageous, scary…Conan ruled
THAT WAS EPIC. 🤣🤣🤣
Already laughing 2 mins in, this is going to be a good one!
I think Conan is going to sell the  chicken bones he "saved" on the Dark Web
I swear at 22:53, you can see actual fear in Sean's eyes as if he's about to watch Conan literally die on his talkshow.
This was my first time watching this show.
Absolute legend!
Best episode ever!!
Amazing
hands down best episode in ages
100% He's topped Gordon Ramsey
Haven't laughed this hard at Hot Ones, ever!
Y'all have to reformat the show after this. Conan is such a powerhouse
Best Hot Ones Ever, Conan is the fkg MAN
I don't think I've ever seen Sean so terrified.
Best Hot Ones ever!!!
great finale !
My dad ❤😊
Checks pulse... "It's there." 😂
Honestly, if you got on Masami Akita, aka Merzbow, creator of the notorious Pulse Demon and god of Noise, with vegan wings, that would be a life-changing interview
conan is aging to perfection
That was like watching a rabid raccoon do stand up. Absolute classic episode 😂
This is why Conan is the best! The GOAT!
If the joker had good parents, he would be like Conan
this has to be hands down the best Hot Ones Interview ive ever seen
Conan is a goat for sure
Sean's questions are top notch and Conan is just a freaking legend
This was as great as I knew it would be 😂 Conan is the best
epic LOL
Oh man, what a rush 😂
Only Conan could commit to this bit and then end with something completely inspirational but that's STILL A PART OF THE BIT. People use the word genius way, way too much these days, but Conan O'Brien is a comedy genius.
Best episode since Coolio
The best season finale guest EVER.
GOAT
We need to get Eric Andre on the travel show with Conan. Absolute insanity.
What a consummate entertainer!   Conan was the last late night host I ever enjoyed, and this is why!
Who left the sauce bottles within reach of Conan!!! Did you forget this is Conan O'Brien???
This beats all the episodes, been a min since i laughed that hard 🤣🤣🤣
Así es tu bulin y tu racismo no ase nada pero Nuestro Dios lo puede todo y el cambio mi amargura por tu amor 🇵🇦
Wait Sean didnt ask a question on the second to last wing
Conan is just the best!
Epic performance by Conan. Simply in awe.
He's gonna cry in the car, and if not the next morning on the toilet. 😅
Conan, what a beast!
there will never...ever ...be another Conan
Conan da goat
Let's bring in Jordan Schlansky next season!!!!!! 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹  I can't wait for him to capture notes of papaya on Da Bomb or the smell of the woods with the last dab 😂😂
2M views in one day ❤
Best one yet!
My youtube feed has been filling with new Conan videos and i'm loving it!
Best episode ever connan  Second best sheila buff 😆 💯
Famn 2.5 million views in a day 😂
Goated
“I bet you live 4 more years, tops”😂
After watching the interview, I can say, with absolute certainty, that Conan is fine and not dying.
Conan has become such a legendary person & i am glad hes finally getting to enjoy doing things he wants to do
Honestly I couldn't stop laughing though this best episode
Im not sure anyone has a more infectious brand of comedy. So many moments of Sean just becoming part of the act whether he meant to or not and it just elevates everything. He's had a 30+ year career and still might be one of the most underrated comedians.
I am stunned .... no words
Conan is the goat
I love it 😂
Is this the best hot ones ever?
No question... greatest "Hot Ones" EVER.
It's great to see Conan go all out with those hot sauce challenges. Always up for a laugh, a true comedy legend.
What an absolute amazing season finale!! Connan sent it out the park and the mily way!! Absolute amazing show Sean and team 👏👏
Best one imo
God this is easily the best episode by a long shot
Conan needs to come back
Please bring hot ones back to shake shack my life in meaningless without it
First thing I thought was “man that’s a nice jacket” then he proceeded to shove a half eaten chicken wing into the pocket.
I love Conan! Finally he's on the show.
BEST. EPISODE. EVER. No one can top Conan.
Probably the best episode of hot ones and I don’t think it’s close
The funniest one for sure 😂
This ladies and Gents is why this muffucka is a legend.
Best episode ever
This episode is going to kick Ramsey's @ss!
🎉
Well.. Conan is the messiest guest you have had on to this point.. So funny...
Its dumb that it went from HBO, to HBO Max, now just Max. One of the great mysteries of our time. 😂
Wow. Conan is trying WAYY too hard here.
Conan is the freaking best!
Is there an Oscar/Emmy category for this?
This is smoking gun proof that Conan is the real deal
Wow this was amazing
Blown away by how Conan takes the sauces like a champ... I was NOT expecting that. You can hear Sean struggling to talk a few times and Conan is just talking like nothing even happened.
Im here before this video gets 100million views
best show ever
Came back from work. I’m saving this episode for when I wake up ❤.
Best one yet.
I love this guy 😂
this was epic❤😂😂
Rest in peace Conan. You went out on top, as always 🫡🫡🫡
Conan is always amazing!!
says it doesnt effect him, has the reddest face the entire time
A true masterclass in comedy. Instantly my new favorite episode.
In my mind, this ranks right up there with the Gordon Ramsey episode. Outstanding!
I started watching this while eating lunch and I really messed up
As funny as Conan naturally is, I can’t believe you didn’t ask him a single question about either SNL or The Simpsons. Fail.
Best host/guest. I never comment, but dang was this a good performance.  👏
"The classics are funny" - Conan 2024  Nothing but respect for this man
I would watch a whole show of Dr Arroyo
Easily the best episode I have ever seen!! Conan is a Barbarian!!!! Ahhh?! See what I did there?! I got the jokes… 😅😬🤦🏻‍♂️
This is one of the best things I've ever seen on the Internet. What a boss!
Conan is the real life Joker 😂😂😂😂😂
Dang! Conan went BEAST MODE!!!!
😂😂😂 this gotta be the best episode and I hope he gets a hot ones  award or something ❤
THE GOAT
Conan goated
Some say Warren G Harding left his heart in San Francisco.
Omfg what a king
Going from Ice Spice to this like fishing in a puddle at Chernobyl vs the Amazon River
Conan was a amazing guest
FIVE STAR HEAT FROM COCO
It's a scientific fact that gingers have a higher pain threshold than anyone else.
Conan is god.
the wings in the pocket is wild
THIS WAS GLORIOUS
23:02 🥲🥹
Conan's lips swelling up like he put on lipstick. 😂
that was intense, love Conan :) he always brings something new to the table!
God bless Conan O'Brien. 😂❤
He needs to host the oscars
Excellent interview!
conan is the best
I love this show. And Conan really nailed it!
This is the best episode that has come out in hot ones history what an absolute legend
Glad to see Conan back on TV. I will be checking out his stuff on HBO MAX!
😂😂 Best episode👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Legend
My man said "CALL THE WIFE!" 😂😂😂😂😂 Conan is a madman!! Hilarious!
Conan always brings it
Well done, guys! Conan is legend!
How is his face not on fire lol
Goes from Ric Flair at 9:25 to Rick Sanchez at 22:00
The best Hot Ones episode ever.
Lisan-al-Gaib!!
After that experience I give Conan about 4 days tops
OH YEAH
remind you that conan graduated from harvard 😂
everyone loves and will always love you
The real Conan the Barbarian ! Thank you so much for this moment!
Conan was right, he got a pass when half his wings do not turn the heat above 100K Scoville. I recall by #5, it should be 70K-100K at the least.
No words.. But  ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Literally, the greatest episode of hot ones was with Conan. Why am I not surprised... 😊
😂😂 Brilliant season finaleeeee! ❤ Totes loved every bit of it... ❤🎉❤🎉
This is more unhinged than Steve-O
Hot Ones all time champ so far hands down😄
Lisan al Gaib!
My eyes are watering cause I’m meeting my idol
Meat in the pocket says it all. Harvard educated Conan is not a fluke. Well read, well versed, aware and awoke. He is fast...keep up.
I think this is the best episode ever hands down
11/10 with Conan, always.
Sean lived in deep fear for Conan's safety.
why is there so much empty space in the middle?  looks real bad
Loving this deep mauve color on your face conan ❤!
I have a whole new respect for Conan.
On behalf of Max everywhere, thank you for this gift. I've got a new text alert.
Comedy is the most potent spice.
fkn legend!!!
Best episode ever!
That was wonderful
Dude looking like he got mugged by the end.  Those red eyes-  haunting
This was greatness! What a OG Conan is 🎉😂
Watch this and the DJ Khaled episode back-to-back.
Every pause on Conan during min 20-23 is a gem
The legend, the myth, the conqueror of the hot wings, the one and only  the mighty Conan O'Brien ....
This is, hands down, the best episode ever.
The Hot Ones bar has been reset.
legend
Conan is an absolute maniac!
I think this is proof that demonic possession can be induced with copious amounts of hot sauce. Come to think of it many of the bottles have the devil on them. So it’s my conclusion that  Conan  needs his own hot sauce with his image on it. On fire. 🔥
Absolute legend. Conan and Gordon Ramsey are the greatest guests.
22:29 At this moment he sees God in there
Conan just made every other guest WISH they could be him
It going to be extremely hard for the next guests to top that episode ☝️☝️
This one made me laugh harder than any other hot wings I've seen
I think the final boss has been beaten. Now all that's left is for the speed runners.
I need a the day after video jesus what a boss
Conan is the best of the bunch.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
He is going to get the worst diarrhea!
Conan’s face is as red as his hair.  His cheeks are turning burgundy after Da Bomb.
Pure Chaos.
Growing up with an dad who ALWAYS pocketed bread from baskets at restaurants, his bit of pocketing the wings absolutely threw me 😂
Absolute f***ing madman.   I've never seen anything like it, and probably never will again.    Best guest ever!
Conan is King and fk jimmy kimmel!!
Richard Lewis got you Conan clearance?
this is best performance ever
best one ever !
"You're not a doctor are you?" "I should be." 😂
This guy might be the greatest thing to come out of America 😂❤
It just got exponentially funnier 😂
Met your match, Sean.😂 Great episode. But if you have him back, Jordan Schlansky needs to be there next time.
I adore Conan. I genuinely love him. This was the best episode of all time.
The chaos of this video is everything I needed today 😂 best Hot Ones episode 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Conan is the GOAT!!
one of the best show guys.. legend
I love when my loves collide!  Can’t wait to see what happened here.  TEAM COCO FOR LIFE!!!
This is EVERYTHING we needed😂🎉❤
Всем хочу пожелать всего самого доброго❤😊. А у меня сегодня день рождения 🎉🎉, мне исполнилось 20 лет
When he put the stethoscope in Seans mouth and said not good I lost it!!!! 😂
That was singular and maniacal. IMO, Conan is one of the greatest all-around comic talents the U.S. has ever produced. I was a little bummed they didn't talk about his stint with The Simpsons.
Brilliant guy… he totally terrified the host 😅
Conan interviewing people vs Conan being interviewed are two different people 😂
I love Conan, he’s always been someone who you knew from the start works soooo hard to be who he is today, it’s not talent it’s dedication
CALL THE WIFE!
Amazing
This was the greatest episode of Hot Ones of all time. Bar none.
I hate talkshows but the only guy whom i admire and respect is Conan   Amazing  comedian genius apart from his natural charisma on talk shows  And just honest humble dude who never misses a chance to make fun of himself  Love you Conan ❤ from Lithuania 🇱🇹
i need a fact check, was he 52 when he went to Korea by chance?
He beat you at your own game, Sean.😂 Great episode. Top of my favourite episodes.
It was f****** inspirational 😂😂😂
Conan is definitely slopping these jalapen-joes correctly
Hands down THE best Hot Ones episode…👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  My man said “why can’t I feel?!?!?”
I had a lot of thoughts and misconceptions about Conan O’Brien, and I am glad to say that I was wrong on many of them. Extremely impressive, One of the best interviews on hot ones I’ve seen in a long time.
Conan is the greatest
A master interviewer with a comedian master interviewer
Conan is F****** PRO
hot ones...meet your new GOAT
Anthony Bourdain would've been such an amazing guest
I'm disappointed that no "Max" was followed by "Weinberg". So...many...opportunities.
Well if I ever doubted Conan's beastliness, I've been set straight. However, this is the first episode I had to tap out of. Watching that man's sauced up open mouth triggered a gag reflex I wasn't aware I had.
This is the greatest episode of the show. Period.
Im not from US, so im not very familiar with Conan, but this right here was amazing. Dude is an entertainment genius
Oh my god
Perfectly for a season finale. And the best one so far. Thoroughly enjoyed this episode👏👏👏
TEAM COCO FOREVER😂👏🏻
the leaking bottle of the bomb took me out
Legend
This channel is still relevant?
Makes me want to get HBO max only for Conan's show. Wishing they will air all episodes so I can just get 1 month 😅😅😅
Conan’s the best! Pure comedy
😂😂😂❤❤❤😂😂😂😂 I just love this man so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Conan on Hot Ones is everything we dreamed and more.
That was odd...
Conan is Crazy, or a machine! I’ve had those last 3 hot sauces and I love spice.. but what he did is diabolical lol! Them sauces are HOT!!
He is a legend. Conan you definitely put in 110%. Show these MF how it's done.
This is the best episode ever.  Next to DJ Khaled, of course.
Legendary show
Conan is a cartoon character
Wow.
My favorite episode so far!!!
I was getting teary-eyed just seeing Conan, I didn't expect him to go full Conan.
I want to see a reaction video with Jordan Schlansky, Sona and Andy watching this episode.
I’ve worked at his parents house in Brookline and he looks exactly like his mother
When conans pink, it makes you think About the sauces he did drink When he steppped off what a stink, he made from la back to boston
Sorry, every-other-guest-after-Conan.
The wing drop is elite
Conan "The Spice Must Flow" O'Brien
FACE & FINGERS COVERED IN SAUCE -- slightly red, watering eyes. I was expecting way more damage lol
Why do hot wings make Conan sound like Billy Crystal 🤔
This. Was. HISTORIC!
Conan rocks … he is a winner !
Classic episode!
I think the sauces Conan was opening are different. The consistency of the Last Dab was runnier than normal - super fun to watch though. I love these interviews.
And that's a wrap people! I never really rated Conan, but from the moment he brought on a fake doctor, to pocketing his wings, to the outrageous, absurd, magnificent catalystic crescendo that was spluttering, hot sauce guzzling & da bomb licking. He is & shall ever remain the Hot Ones mad king. Bravo!
Conan is simply a national treasure
Conan suffered for us...Legend...
Those who truly grew up with Conan probably realize that he would have died happy on that last bite while telling the youth of the world to read Don Quixote as his "doctor" took the dead pulse from his tongue with everyone laughing.
He did not break a sweat. T h i s   IS   T H E Best Hot Ones SO Far.   Conan OBrien, you are something else. Respect.
This might be the best thing I've ever watched.
el Mejor episodio de todos, cuando terminó hubo aplausos en mi sala 🎉
Conan is a BEAST, way to do an interview, Sean!! HILARIOUS, man I love this one!! LOLOLOLOL
Bro I just full on clapped sittin on my couch
I love him 😂😂
Lol the doctor when he takes Conan's pulse 🤣 "It's there."
"Are you even a doctor?" "I should be." 🤣🤣🤣🤣
GOAT
Instant classic!!!
You sir have another viewer for your show on MAX (Terrible name haha) I'm so excited
Conan doing Da Bomb... 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Best episode of the all. I love both Sean and Conan so much!
Conan pocketing the bones had me DEAD dude. 😂
How do you top this?  This has to be the best episode by far and I'm sure everyone on set that day knew it as they were filming it.  My goodness that was SO entertaining and I love that even through all of the comedy and insanity that unfolded before us, Conan still answered every question and gave Sean the highest compliments I'm sure he's ever received.
Conan is Fing crazy!!! love him
What an amazing episode - Conan is the greatest
Fantastic. The only way up from here is Obama.
The unhinged king! I love Conan so much
Conan is a true professional. Simply amazing
being told you're a good interviewer by Conan obrien has to be one step on the path to nirvana
10/10
This is my favorite episode since David Blaine 🔥🔥🔥🔥
best hot ones ever
Wow. He does not seem well....
Conan is comedic genius
Alright I have a potential theory - Conan was a writer on the Simpsons, and the episode when Homer eats the insanity pepper after drinking candle wax is surely known by Conan, so was that his trick for pulling this off? Hmmm!
This is the BEST one by far 😂😂😂 Love Conan!
The fact he has a doctor just doing whatever for him is by far the funniest thing that has happened on this show…
Wow. Legendary.
unhinged, gross, and absolutely perfect
This Guy is a legend , there's no other person funnier that Conan
Wow. What a CLEVER conceit with the doctor bit. This guy is too sharp.
I think Conan is being rude!!!!  Trying to mock an amazing setup and interviewer in Sean.
I can't get over him collecting the wings after lololol so good
Even if Sean told Conan a trademark "careful 'round the eyes"... Something tells me Conan wouldn't listen
Conan will always be my favorite late night host.❤❤❤
I love Conan.
Jajajajajajajajajaja he always makes my day!!!! Thank You Conan!!!!
Conan sets the bar to unreachable heights
absolutely epic episode
"the water buffalo and i made amends" = "me and the crew ate pretty well that night"
best episode ever. the absurdity of the finale made me really want to see Tim Heidecker and/or Eric Wareheim on this show -- please!!
GOAT
This legend absolutely annihilated and dominated. Team Coco forever!!!
Are you kidding me?  That was so great!
Best episode by far
I am fifty and have been watching Conan since he started.  I will likely be 80 when he passes, but I can picture my old self weeping at his loss.   He has been an excellent companion to this life.
Conan is the goat love everything he does
This is going down as one of my top 3 if not favorite episode of Hot Ones ever. Conan really is the GOAT
i have never been stressed and happy at the same time. Only Conan, what a legend
the wing pocket bit was playing the long game 🙌🏻
THERE IS NO WAY!!! THIS ISNT FAKE.  NO ONE CAN EAT THAT SAUCE LIKE THAT WITH NO REACTION
That was beautiful
😂😂😂🤣🤣
This is one of the best out!
I will marry Conan RIGHT NOW
Conan is a legend! Is he still alive after this show? I love Conan
I love Conan
best episode ever
April 18th i will check it out because of this
Dude Conan is crazy
best episode ever
He really was entertaining and I do think he could feel some of those. You can see him becoming redder and sweatier and he reacted just going wilder and more enthusiastic. Well done Conan! Well done Sean!
Comedy GOLD!!!!  Probably the funniest episode ever!  Thank you, @first we feast for bringing in Conan for this legendary  ride.
This right here is exactly why we LOVE Conan…and why we will never understand my Hollywood corps don’t appreciate him more.
The next Hot Ones sauce should be called "Chile Con Conan" and it should have a pepper from each of the sauces he had.   Best episode ever!
Disgusting!
“Did you say this is pure pepper?” As he manically drinks hot sauce off a wing.
There is only one celebrity that if I ever saw out in public I would lose absolute control of my soul. Conan is that one celebrity. This world is so lucky to have this human
The greatest to ever do it 🔥🔥
Best episode yet! Conan sure made a show of it!
Wow! Great episode. Conan is a beast!
All that mess and his hair is still intact. Conan will always Conan.
this was insane, and I loved it
2.5m views in 24 hrs wow
This is the most legendary hot ones episode ever
Conan was pure chaos and I loved every second of it.... best hot ones guest ever
NOW THAT FREAKING ENTRETANMENT!!! Ladies and gentleman, the one, the only, Conan O'Brien!!!
Watched it coz of Conan I do agree he asks good question but never find the show interesting   It seems he is more focused on getting questions out therefore may seem unnatural at times  But that’s just my opinion So if you love the show , I respect that
Wild man!
Conan's answer to the most mediocre president just goes to show that the world could've had such a cool history professor if he didn't move on to become one of the greatest comedic heroes of our time 🫶🏼
Had tears running down my face, this was the best ep yet
Da Bomb had been conquered, people should drink Conan on lvl 8 from now on.-
I'm from the UK, and Conan isn't anywhere near as well known here as he is in the US. But watching this performance and the fine line he walked between respect for the format and host, the need to be entertaining, and his will to push himself through the experience, makes me understand a little better why he's had such a long career
Love how 20mins in, the wheels come off, and Conan goes about as far as he can.
Iconic
The Goat
Yeah. You gotta shut this show down after this performance. He just broke it. It’ll never be topped. We’ve reached the mountain top.
I will be devastated the day we lose Conan forever… He’s a walking ball of joy ❤️
The King
Tour de force.
Conan is such a legend.
The world deserves an aftermath clip.
A legend ❤❤❤❤❤
legend!
Everyones appreciation for conan has me in tears. This is a good day
Conan is the best, the best episode yet, Love Coco, always make me laugh 😂😂
100% my favorite episode!!!😂
I love him.
Every part of this episode has memorable and hilarious quotes to be used going forward 😂 Ive never commented on a youtube video (I've commented to ask a question once) and I have to just say this was pure gold.
legend
The most incredible guest in the history of Hot Ones.
22:42 , 23:00
Conan is BRILLIANTLY hilarious!
I don’t understand why people like this guy so much? He tries too hard to act funny. Maybe it’s an American thing..
Conan will take a bullet if he can get laughs.  Can’t wait to hear about this on the podcast.
What a wild ride. Best episode award goes to Mr Conan. Good job sir!!
Conan will be joining Warren Harding soon...
BEST HOT ONES... EVERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!
That was EPIC!! What a genius! 😂🎉
Conan the goat
i was expecting an OD. disappointed
I love that he is trying to laugh off the bomb acting like all is OK but his hand holding the milk is literally shaking.  Strong stance, respect.
As a kid I never really paid attention to talk show hosts; it was just boring to me when I could watch cartoons.  I saw IMMEDIATELY why Conan is where he is, guy is such a great energy. I hope to get even portion of his talent.
those wings didn’t know what hit ‘em
Conan really is a treasure
Best one yet.
Conan forever the goat
biggest mistake was choosing to eat while watching this
This was one unexpected and too funny
Best American talkshow host of all time, and its not even close.
6:25 “the other guy” — savage burn. 🔥
This is up there with Ramsay as a legendary episode. Amazing!
This has to be one of the best episodes ever!! Love conan!
To be honest, red heads are known for their ability to tolerate pain, so, it’s not like he’s a normal human.
He is a man
How Conan just took control is just amazing
Conan IS The Bomb Beyond Insanity
Best hot ones ever. Love Conan!
So many memes will be created from this one episode. He was brilliant.
one oh best episode of all time 👏😂
Thank you Sean so much for having Conan finish off the season. I got a little lost in some of these interviews by not knowing who some of these people were. But you brought it back as hard as you could with Conan. Best interview on hot ones out of all the seasons and I've seen I think every episode. Thank you hot ones for this classic. You going to be doing so many cuts from this the next two years wow......
One of the best, if not the best, episodes. Loved it. What a champ.
"you not a doctor are you?" 😂😂
This has to be one of the best guests you've ever had on this show! I love Conan!! lol
😂conan is the legend❤
😮
How does he not age !!!
Absolutely unhinged.
Best Hot Ones episode ever.....no guest will ever top what Conan just did!
I never listen to Andy!  Lol. My God Conan is my absolute favorite since I was like, 13 years old. This is the best Hot Ones ever.
After years I watched this to check on Conan. His insanity is still all there and well. And that's awesome. Kudos.
Usually Sean follows the guest and goes action for action. He said Not Today! Best Hot Ones in recent memory, by far.
Conan is a national treasure
Bravo!
This episode and the dj khaled episode are my favorites for sure
something  so poetic about da bomb slowly pouring out while conan does his plug for max
Greatest episode on this series - Conan was brilliant! Have loved him my entire life. Who would want to follow such an iconic performance?
"Dr. Arrroyo" 😆
Legendary episode!
We finally know the answer to who would win in a fight: Conan O’Brien or DJ Khaled?
Conan's fallen off, but at least Sona wasn't there for this one.
I absolutely love that this is #1 trending atm
bro the doctor saying 'its there' about the pulse cracked me up
You might as well rebrand the show & start over as I don't know how any guest is going to compare to that now.  What a legend.  Sean usually matches his guests' approach to wing antics, but I got the sense was thrown off his game a bit on this one.  Haha
this is the zenith of the show. Everything after this is just plain
watching two socially skilled interviewers interact is unsurprisingly entertaining
Conan truly commits to every bit he does
"You're not a doctor are you?"  "I should be"   😂😂
I died when he drank the last dab experience like it was a shot
This is easily in the top 5 episodes of this show.
How did Conan manage to make Hot Ones his own?! What a star.
I felt it when he yelled "WHY CAN'T I FEEL!"
Conan looks like trump
The beginning was kinda awkward, I think Conan was trying a little too hard at first and it clashed with Sean's style, but once he sort of broke character to tell Sean what a great interviewer he is, the show quickly turned into something special.  What a finale!
Conan is a beyond gifted entertainer. This made me cry laughing.
THE GOAT
Genuinely hoping Conan was okay after that
Greatest hot ones of all time hands down
“Can I keep these?” Unhinged greatness 😅
This has convinced me that Conan is some kind of actual trickster god
Dude is living louder than any millennial on the planet
ABSOLUTELY LEGENDARY
Lolol Conan is the best.... The best there ever was
if conan is not your favorite talk show host, you need to get checked out(prefferably not by DR Arroyo)
The best one hands down 😂😂
is that the jacket he wore on curb season 12?
I made the huge mistake of watching this while my baby was napping on my chest. I had to contain so much laughter I thought my chest would explode! 😆 CONAN, you are the GOAT!!!
Okay. Somehow, *I* needed a moment from all of that. Mr. Conan O’Brien, you have my eternal respect. My goodness the dedication.
This episode shows just how massively the cable networks missed out on Conan. League of his own. Legend
I have watched quite a few of these. And i gotta say this was actually really funny and conan you rock bro
22:59 please someone make this into a gif/meme x:
Conan O'Brien and Gordon Ramsey best so far
22:47 me after 45 seconds in bed
I think this is my favourite episode of Hot Ones ever. I was crying laughing and a bit scared for Conan's health 😅
Conan is the opposite of DJ Khaled's Hot Ones. Literally never giving up V.S giving up immediately.
My depression has been cured by this episode.
Mad respect 🫡
One of the funniest ones I’ve ever seen Conan is hilarious 😂
That was absolutely incredible. What a legend hahaha
Now THAT'S what this show is supposed to be like!
Epic. Best hot ones, period. Conan is a legend.
Goat guest
He's a legend
This was a revelation.  Favorite episode ever
Ghandi  said it and popeye said it 😅
No,no,no❣️
Conan leans into the insanity of the concept of an interview show whose primary mechanism is unhinging its guests with diabolical levels of spice on a chicken wing. He hits every diverse facet of his persona in a poetically beautiful expression of the long legged red headed clown America has grown to love over a multi-decade career.
This is quite possibly the best thing I’ve ever seen in my life.
This was fantastic! The bar has been set!! I had no interest in his show prior to this episode and now I can’t wait to watch it April 18th on Max!
Okay you guys need to name a sauce after him
The GOAT
This would have been more enjoyable if he wiped his face. Its so disgusting and distracting to look at that lol
Best episode ever. :D
Conan went more than 110%
What a great compliment from Conan!
A lot of firsts on this episode. Wing drop? Genius.  I laughed, I cried, I vomited.  This episode is already in the top 10 of all time.
Conan can commit to the bit.
The best episode by far.  I cried laughing so hard at the end
Team CoCo!
Bro murdered that
Conan is truly a professional in his craft. He's incredibly well-spoken.
Goat
"He's not the best, but he's affordable"  Sums up the American Healthcare System beautifully
“I don’t fear your wings, man.” 😂immediately dead😂
This can never be topped. Just make your peace with it. Lightning has struck. 😂
Towards the end Conan looks like   Elon Musk as a vampire
We have once again assembled to watch Conan The God of Comedy <3, What a time to be alive !!
Conan is a lengend
Conan is epic, this has been the most enjoyable episode I've seen so far
This display of self control...holy moly...this is impressive
While I love this show I think you've made a grave mistake. This episode will never be topped. Its the zenith. You might just want to end it now.
What a closure to a season...
I would love there to be a camera following Conan around for the next 24 hours
I feel like I can never watch another hot ones because this will forever be the best one
He’s a legend
This must be the best episode in the history of Hot Ones! Conan is a beast 😳😳😳👍🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I died when I tried 1/10 from what Conan drank from the bomb. He’s crazy
I just will always adore and appreciate Conan for his subtle kindness.
This is the best YouTube video ever. Period.
Best. Episode. Ever.  Let’s beat Gordon Ramsey’s view count!
Heck yeah, you got Conan!!! Top 5 episode!!
This was so chaotic but I loved every second of it 😭😭
How can you follow conan on Brian
So many great episodes with top notch guests but this will be easily one of the best ones in my opinion. Now we all have to wait for the next season.
This was incredible
The “I’MMMM FINE” at 23 minutes in has me crying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The showman. What a legend.
22:37 Ha ha ha! Sean's face!
Never had spice but never flinched, paused or stopped talking. Even drank from the bottle and took multiple bites of every wing?! WHO and HOW?!! He is super human! Great interview!😂
Oh thank you Conan.
"no, I'm not returning the jean jacket because of the red stitching, it's because the pockets smell like chicken wings"
Jordan Schlansky Needs to do this. 😂🤣😂
When the camera pans up from Conan drenching his last wing to his sauce-covered face, you knew Hot Ones had hit an all-time high.
I remember Conan saying on his podcast that when it comes down to making a good bit or gag, he turns unstoppable. And i think we've all witnessed it here how he muscled through the pain and stuck with the insane bit (with the professional help of Dr. Arroyo of course)
Conan with Kevin hart and ice cube in the car is one of the funniest bits ever, love Conan
i love conan, his bits his podcast, but is he going insane ?
i know conan is crazy good but this episode still surprised me. i dont even know if i could have done a better episode lol u are insane man congrats on the episode and your wonderful leading up to be on hot ones and best of wishes to me seeing your future but man ease up on the sauce.......litterallyyyyyyyy..........yyyyyyyy
Conan singlehandedly just made every prior guest look weak and petty lol 😂
20:26 I always wondered what that sound was
Dude Coolio'd that wing.
😂brilliant!
Has anyone checked up on him?  😁
Best episode ever!
I think this was the best episode
Ohhh yeahh Conan, yeahhh yeahh, Shawn you got a show right there....yeahhh
I thought el pollo Loco would go out of busniess by now but it's booming
Best interview ever
Can I keep these😂
Conan is such a legend. This man is a force of nature.
Conan the Goat
Bruh, I was trying to eat and then he started slobbering. Still love him tho.
This one is definitely going to be one of the most viral videos cuz it’s definitely the most insane😂
👏👏👏🏆👏👏👏 Conan just made Da Bomb look like olive oil!
Sean be standing on an apple box at 1:08
When he drank da bomb  my mouth dropped!! Conan is nuts! Haha
This is the first time I've seen Sean be outmatchef by one of his guests.He normally has such a commanding presence here  he's just alone for the ride
This is genuinely incredible. I dont know how he did it but I'm just so happy we got to see this 😂
Conan be forgetting those chicken wings in his pocket and a few weeks later “hey a snack, yum”
Was he okay after this?!?  Conan's amazing! 😂
Conan O Briiiiiiiiiiiann!!! 🥁 🕺
Conan is the best! No competition!
Conan will ALWAYS be relevant!  Bravo!
there isnt anyone like conan
im gonna get that max subscription even though they are not available in korea
Yeah da bomb, it kicks in after a while lol but it's not that bad either haha
Finally, my favorite celeb ever!
Conan has once again set the bar.
Best Hot Ones episode ever.
Im concerned
Nice work in Vanila Sky 😄
This. This is why I love Conan. Cheers to another great season to everyone who makes this show happen! What a way to close this one off! 👏🏻 ❤🎉
I use to do the Conan walk out dance in  middle school in 98 .. crazy how kimmel fallon have a show and not Conan
That might have been my favorite episode ever!
The thing is that, for one, when Conan is doing comedy, he can almost choose not to feel pain and just keep going through the bit. His need to be funny is greater than his need to protect himself. And the other thing is he’s a tv professional: when he is ”drinking” the hot sauce he’s just movie drinking—blocking the mouth of the bottle with his tongue and not letting much in his mouth. Of course it’s still incredibly hot but he’s been in show business long enough to know how to accentuate the spectacle.
20:50 had me dead
My goat, my idolo
Mad respect for Conan. Crazy genius.
Something I didn't realise I have been waiting my entire life for
This episode will NEVER be beaten. OMFG, Conan is literally, spiritually and figuratively on fire! Legend X Infinity.
Best hot ones ever!
What I take from that interview is that we really have to live life to the fullest. I'll be gone so fast. Thank you Sean and especially thank you Conan for being the greatest! Funny yet poignant! Lots of love!
Jesus H. Christ, I never thought I would add Conan O'Brien to my list of people I fear but this did it
April 18th.  Hahahaha It’s Jim Jeffries response to Valentine’s Day
Best Hot Ones Ever
Greatest hot ones ever!
LEGEND
What a showman!
The worst ones have been this and LL cool J because they were too contrived
WHAT AN ABSOLUTE LEGEND 😂
This was an amazing episode. I forgot how much Conan makes me laugh. Controlled and intentional choose.
Man.. Not even a fan of late nite. If I was, don't think Conan would have been my choice.... but respect... and man.. just crazy.. that was a trip.. No way Sean could direct this interview. LOL
I've never seen anything like this before! 😮
I have a feeling all that spice is going to be significantly hotter going out than it was going in. Conan, I salute you! And I also greatly pity your toilet for the suffering it shall endure.
I expected it to be good I did not expect to actually be cry laughing through it
for Conan not liking spice he killed the challenge!! I bet he's still hurting lolz. Long live the KING!! CONAN 4 Prez
I started to worry about Conesie at wing 5 bc I remembered his commitment. You can really see Sean’s genuine concern near the end.
In the end Conan's face reminds me of Baron Harkonnen from Lynch Dune:)
He came out in the best outfit I've ever seen him wear and proceeded to put hot wings in the pockets. I should have known then this would go off the rails...
This Episode did not disappoint! Master of comedy.
The only thing that would make this better is a Jordan Schlansky cameo.
Absolute legend
This is easily one of the best episodes ever. Conan is a true legend. Between saying he’s not afraid of the wings and bringing a doctor. To handling da bomb like a champ, and finishing up with a slobbering mess waving hot sauce around. He fulfilled my expectations and beyond.
Alright this is it. Shut it down. It's all downhill from here.
WOW. Just WOW.
Hot wings goat!!
Purely unhinged Conan is the GOAT
Just amazing!!! 🔥
Absolutely love your content 🔥 did you know there’s a Norwegian dude basically copying your stuff? He’s called Snack king and «made» Hot Seat…
RIP Conan!
This was EASILY the BEST and most FUNNIEST interview you guys have ever done!  Conan is a genius!
This must be the end of the show forever. Who can top this!
Brilliant
Effin epic 😂
Now that might be my top favorite episode next to Gordon Ramsey  of course.
Bro this dude had to of had Covid
"CALL THE WIFE!"
funniest mf alive
I am entertained
Best hot wings interview I’ve seen. I really miss Conan on TV. I am going to get Max just to see his new show
Wing drop footage, please.
This is the greatest episode of all time! Conan is the GOAT!!!
Conan's the man, the myth, the legend, the Rooster 🐓 🔥 No he ain't gonna die!
21:49 the state of this scene 🤣🤣🤣🤣
A legend interviewing THE LEGEND!
Conan has got to be the only guest to match eric andres energy
This man knows how to clean a plate 😅😂😂
This was so good! Makes me wonder how Nathan Fielder would do against the wings of death. Get him on the show, @firstwefeast!
Seriously, he is really drinking the sauce?! 🤯
Ive never been a fan of any of these late night shows but Conan won me over with this. Hilarious.
The best Hot Ones episode, bar none. I would expect nothing less from Conan!
Yep im now a Conan fan. Much respect
22:53 Conan closing was perfect 😂😂
That might be the craziest thing I've ever seen
Could've bet my left nut that Conan's gonna be extra with all his comedy
20:50 is when i lost my mind😂😂
Wow I've never seen Conan's talk show (just clips over the years), but he is TRULY wacky on this Hot Ones, oh my goodness. xD
Single best episode in the history of Hot Ones
What genius had the idea of bringing a water buffalo to a studio?! 🤦‍♀️ So glad it didn't pierce anyone with it's horns, that'd have been nasty. Poor Conan! This was a great show. Conan like no other guest
The true GOAT.
Hands down best guest ever
this is a generational moment
Wow what a finale. Conan brought it.
Conan doesn't just know show business...he IS show business. This has to be one of the best hot ones episodes EVER. Not a single situation that Conan doesn't have an answer for
🔥GOAT🔥
Have always loved Conan’s work and this absolutely did not disappoint!
hilarious!
omfg he stayed loyal to the bit all the way to the end
The guest we wanted AND the guest we needed🫶
As a kid I would stay up late to watch Connan because of his outrageous antics and I’m glad he’s continued to be himself very observant and critical to society and still make it comedy.  I’m 36 now I can see I’ve seen connan for most of my life and he’s been consistent.
EPIC!!
This is the greatest episode of Hot Ones ever produced. Instant classic.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
the more he masked his pain, the older his references became lolol
2.5 mil views in less than 24 hours ,GOATED!!
I really miss Conan's show.
Ladies and gentlemen, the greatest of all time 🐐
My new favorite episode!
Never expected that this will be the craziest episode ever, and I loved every second of it Conan, you are a true TV treasure
So conan may or is prob one of the top to have the most sconville than any guest. Lol my god the dude is a machine.
April 18th, isn't that a Holiday 😉
Hands down, BEST EPISODE EVER❤❤❤❤❤
That was actually such a funny episode, great finale.. 😂
By far, the BEST episode of Hot Ones!
13:46😅😅
Greatest guest ever 😂❤
Bro is so chaotic, the way he ruined that beautiful denim jacket, by stuffing chicken wings in it! 😂
i litrally screamed so loud neighbours heard me when i saw that conan is finally on Hot Ones. COnan is really crazy, probably first time ever that a guest on hot ones was the one who's trying to distract the host from the spice of the bomb
Conan is a LEGEND
This is the best episode of all time. Can’t stop laughing.
The master
But the end conan turned into rick sanchez 😂😂😂
Has anyone checked on him?
think this is the first time sean did not mirror a guest to the tee
One of the best dance moves of all time..."The string cut off dance"
The real danger was when the kangaroo go loose on his show 😂
Such a classic Aries😂
"Call the wife 😂"
can this guy not chew with his mouth closed?
As an RN I can tell you that is exactly how you use a stethoscope 😂 seriously though this is my favorite episode of Hot Ones to date. If I was still in school I would write my final treatise on this episode and it wouldn’t do it justice. Conan you are LEGENDARY.
Hands down the funniest Hot Ones! Conan is a fool 🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️
"Can I keep these?" Oh we're in for a ride friends. The GOAT is here.
Conan will not be topped on hot ones. I can almost guarantee it👏👏👏
Easily the best guest and it's not even close.
Conan brings the entertainment. Always.
Imagine being the next guest on hot ones and having to follow up this performance.
This was the PEAK of hot ones only other interview I can think would come close would be Narwuar
Conan here was a mix of Robin Williams, Chris Farley and Norm Macdonald!
And just like that a new hero was created
annoying
The best guest EVER!
😂😅🔥👊👌👍💪
This is the same man that performed strenuous physical comedy in 106 degree F heat in Thailand. Comedy gives him heat resistance. 😂
How is this guy even funny..... yawn
Clearly Conan pulled a Homer Simpson and poured wax in his mouth before the show. ;)
The only other person to eat as much sauce as Conan on a wing was Coolio. And he died…. 😅
THIS IS GOLD!
LOVE Conan! Thank you Hot Ones!! Conan never ceases to amaze and always delivers the best. His performance made me think of Johnny Knoxville and their shenanigans. Conan totally raised the bar and I think we're going to see some great entertainment in the next season. Bravo! ❤
Disgusting, repulsive and embarassing
Legendary. No one is Conan.
best one ever.
If it wasn’t Conan I’d say this dude was on coke.  Since it’s Conan.. I know it’s just him 😂
Conan is high as f*** at the end 😂😂
....a little over the top.....but still...props for swimming in hot sauce....methinks he is going to regret it later.....but who knows?
Conan is seriously one of the all-time great comedy performers. Put that man in any situation and he'll find a way to turn it into a spectacle.
God i love Conan
Single greatest Hot Ones episode to ever be recorded.
Fantastic! Love this man! 👏
Best episode of the season for sureeeee. Conan is amazing in so many ways.
Sean should end the series right here. Legendary episode. For 30+ years, Conan's been playing chess while the rest of us simpletons have been playing checkers. Master class in comedy.
Im pretty sure this man is straight up clinically insane.
I didn' know the show was a BuzzFeed product its cool then Ze Frank must be proud.
Conan DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!!! I am so glad I didn’t miss this episode. ❤❤❤love Conan ALWAYS
Top 5 episode all time easy
This is the best episode to date
LEGEDARY !!!!
One of the best episodes :D Hillarious duo
Wow Conan has some serious pain tolerance.
That was sooooooooooooo hilarious ! We need another redheaded giant, JOSH HOMME from Queens of the stone age, very funny too !
Many years from now, when Conan has entered the halls of comedy Valhalla, and we are watching endless retrospective videos of his genius, the unhinged, magical mania of this episode's finale will be included on every one of them. We just watched an iconic comedy bit get carved in marble for all time.
Coban is one of a kind. Absolutely brilliant
The regret after taking a pull off the bottle.
Conan Unchained!
This has to be one of the *best* episodes EVER.  I was laughing out loud quite a few times during this one.
The best hot ones of all time!
“Call the wife!”
I've had these hot sauces from the end of the lineup.  What Conan was doing, drinking and rubbing the sauces on his face... that's amazingly tough.
05:23 onwards hahah
I had to pause this many times to control my gagging😅I can’t handle gross things too well
This show has been nothing but incredible and fun but I have to say hands down this is the BEST episode to date. If I was in grad school I would write my final treatise on this episode and I still wouldn’t do it justice. Conan, the man, the myth, the LEGEND.
Outstanding performance Conan.
This was the best one you've ever done.
I've never been so terrified of someone eating hot wings before. This was side-splittingly, terryingly hilarious. I feel changed.
This is my new favorite episode lol. Literally had me in tears.
the BEST one YET!... Love me some Conan.. I remember staying up late to watch his show all the time. back in college.. just a great host and interviewer.. this ep literaly had me laughing crying!!
"They used to call it HBO but people found that too POPULAR!!" 😂
Greatest episode to date.
What a guy, Conan! Great interview per usual! Should be on Sean’s top episodes! Congrats!
This is the first time I see Da Bomb be so violated and it to be Conan is so right
This was amazing
Whats wrong with me? Why cant I feel?
24:10 The fact that he is doing all this, and still manages to purposefully leave the hot sauce sideways - just to make a mess - for comedic effect is insane
Crazy
I. am. crying 😂 I get the feeling Conan’s doctor is not a real doctor
Best episode ever.
Best episode ever?
🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️
Conan is the man! He knocked it out of the park 😂
Ge brought a doctor!!😂😂 I hope he said "I'll do hot ones, but only if I can bring in a doctor because it's hilarious!"
epic
This is going to be soooo hard to beat  for shear showmanship.  Gotta love this man!!! ❤️  He jumped on the back of the buffalo again 😂
I can't imagine what he was going through several hours after.
Maaaan I love this dude!
Best. Interview. Ever. I’m crying, I’ve been laughing so hard. Would have loved for Andy to be there, too but that might be too much for me to handle.
Sean , please tell me this is the best episode of the entire show since you started 😂 amazing !!! 🎉 thank you for having him !!!!!! 🎉
Best episode of all time
I haven't watched anything but the intro...and Conan is still my hero
Conan is my hero - love this guy!!! Absolute legend!!!!
23k comments and all I can add is that my gut hurts from laughing so hard.  That was amazing.
Loved the Warren G. Harden bit. How Conan is able to recall history cogently after slathering Da Bomb all over his tongue is a feat lol.
Screaming his intestines turned into acid 😂😂😂
Conan is one of a kind 😂😂😂
In Ireland potato is a spice
no way this happened
I love all the smack talk before Da Bomb. Good thing he brought his own "doctor". 🤣
What a legend lol this is the best episode ever 😂
Super funny!!
THAT is how you do it. All the other's have been peasants with the heat. Conan 🏆
GOATED episode!
Haven't watched hot ones in forever, but this is epic
1 min in and i hit the like button! lol
BEST. HOT ONES. EVER.
Did he scream Moria?  Or Gloria?
One of the BEST episodes, love it. Conan is an animal, the insanity goes up to cope with each hotter wing. Andy Daly next please! Let Hot Ones bring Forrest MacNeil out to play.
Easily the best guest ever
All my prayers to Conan’s toilet after that
By far, the best guest ever!!! 🧡🤣
It turns out Irish ppl. don't Use spice because they are impervious to it.
Jajajajajajaajajajaja
Conan has been the best and most comedic guy since I was a baby and I’ve watched him since I was a kid to now when I’m an old guy. The guy is legendary.
Salah satu episode terbaik hot ones 😂
I think he coated his mouth in wax so he wouldnt feel the heat. Probably be talking to a fox in the desert after this.
Wow. Easily a top 5 Hot Ones of ALL TIME. Maybe even top 3?
That is a great season finale... Conan is golden!
Hall of Fame for this epsiode, Conan is the Goat
The bomb beyond insanity needs to be renamed Conan the barbarian talk show host in his honor. Hall of fame.
This is by far the best episode to date. Go Conan
Sean you played out Hot Ones and got the good ending, what will you play next?
He could play The Joker in alive action Batman Beyond movie
Best episode there is and will ever be!
Thats why Conans the Greatest!
Legend.
Holy smokes!!! What a delivery. True Master of his craft, showbuizz. Did not see this coming. Great great finale and top notch episode
😂
I need to know that Conan is still alive.
Unhinged. As much as I hate to say it:  series finale material
The best there ever was.
I just wish he would wipe his mouth.  That being said, it was the BEST episode of this show I’ve ever seen. Hands down.
What a personality!
Best one ever. Has anyone checked on him since?
“That’s not show business. Show business is you’re getting the greatest show in the world.” Amazing.
Best one yet!
I guess it’s really  true that redheads have higher pain tolerance. Good lord, Conan, you should have been a spy. They could try to torture you, and you would laugh in their faces.
That was amazing
The GOAT doing his thing. How much enjoyment I get from this episode is through the roof!
Instant classic
Every time i hear Max, think Coco is talking about Weinberg😅
That was the most enthusiastic display of wingin it I have ever seen!
best of the best ! :D
Best episode of all time
Legend
I didnt know how much the concept of a saucy pocket would upset me...
Legendary man
Shout out to Conan for bringing real aries energy to the studio 😂
Conan is a monster and we need to invent a new weapon to stop him because I no longer believe modern weaponry is enough.
There are no words except to say if this isn't in the top 5 off all time I don't what it is. I've always loved Conaan, but this man just moved up even more in my esteem for him.😂
the way Conan complemented Sean so sincerely must have meant a lot to him well done Sean
When Conan dies, one of the items I will bid on is his jacket, complete with dessicated chicken wings still in the pockets.  Best episode yet!  He was hilarious.
"And look at you. You are an animal." (c) Jordan Schlansky
Hands down the best Hot Ones episode yet.  The best ❤️❤️❤️
How is he still making money.....
Sorry but this one is the best one out of all of them
This guy is MADNESS 😂 I love this dude
Conan is  an absolute Legend😂😂😂
I was a kid when I read Chaucer, he's not lying, I laughed hard!
Sean looks genuinely concerned.
Can we get a Conan "Oh yeeahh!" from 26:19 for every episode outro?
Conan without laugh track is best conan
I dunno if anyone will get this reference but conan by the end reminds me of mr. sark when he would freak out on machinima inbox and stuff
oh man conan, ive never had so many belly laughs    edited to add, conan talkin chit
The TP will definitely need to go into the freezer for tomorrow! dab only, no wipe!
Absolutely unhinged 😂 and I’m here for it!!!!!!
Beautifully unhinged!  Truly loved this episode!
I’m 40 and I’ve been watching Conan since late night in my teens. Seeing him still committed to the bit warms my heart. When I saw him pour extra da bomb I knew he was going to break character 😂😂😂😂 the speech at the end brought tears to my eyes. He has been the best guest I have ever seen on hot ones.
After ice spice, this is a well deserving send off to the season. Well balanced. Props where they're due
hahahahaha..
He used the same method Homer used of drinking a candle before coming on the show, IN YOUR FACE, SPACE COYOTE!
Conan is the GOAT. This is just even more evidence of that.
Is his show now
I think we all just witnessed the greatest Hot Ones of all time.
Man I haven’t watched any Conan content in years. Forgot how much he made me laugh. 😂
Red heads are often immune to anesthesia and other things. I wonder if the spice is the same.
This was hands-down the best episode to date. Thank you Conan :)
Conan is tougher than Shaq. Words I never thought I’d speak but here we are.
best episode so far
The best! Simply the best episode ever!!! When legends meet ❤
Conan never ceases to amaze me with how well he can "Yes, and..." himself.
👏beats all late night shows on air
Conan O'Brien? Is this terribly bad host still around?
Been waiting for years for this.  It was everything I thought it would be.
Conan is what gives life meaning
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣best episode
😂😂😂😂
Can't wait for Conan's next podcast, "Conan Needs A Gastroenterologist."  Seriously, though, Conan is one of my favorite human beings. I don't care much about celebrities, but Conan is a guy who I truly respect and have admiration for. I wasn't exactly following his career in my adolescence, but I was fortunate enough to discover some of his best moments on Youtube. Thanks for all the laughs, Mr. O'Brien. Much love.
Literally crying laughing at this. What an incredible guest.
Good lord.  Salute!
PLEASE LEAVE THE CONAN SCREAM UNDER THE FIRST WE FEAST OUTRO! 26:19
Suomi mainittu, tortillat avataan!
Having Conan O'Brien on is like having george carlin or norm MacDonald on. The show is his show now, have fun.
Honestly that was the greatest thing ever
legend 😮
Age and experience.. anyone?
My favorite episode of all time.
Instantly an iconic episode!! 😂😂
“This isn’t a bit, this is real life!” and then immediately asks “Dr. Arroyo” to check on Sean. That’s commitment to the bit. 😂
Conan is and always will be the GOAT
Conan is the goat. True master
He's the best white guy ever
Conan is a freakin legend 🙌🏻😂
Savage, eating like Dotharaki. 😂😂😂
Why is he pocketing chicken wings?
Legend
God, I hope we don't lose Conan EVER.
Wing Drop!!🤣🤣
Conan is the one. *LISAN AL GAIB*
Best guest ever by far!
Conan didn’t just become a guest, on this episode, he became a collaborator. An absolute master at what he does
Absolutely the BEST episode ever!!!!
these are the rantings of a man that just saw the yawning gates of death, and decided to become the eater of death
This is why Conan is KING!
Conan putting the wing in his pocket kills me lololol. Man i loved watchin this guy when i was a kid.
He is out of control 😂😂😂
😂😂😂
I dunno, this might be the best 27 minutes of YouTube content I've seen in the last decade.
Conan is the embodiment of “understood the assignment”. He’s literally goated with the sauce. An absolute madman!
Conan turned into a Dana Snyder character at the end.
I thought the comedy of the DJ Khalid episode would never be topped.  I was wrong.
Best guest …. So far.
"whats funnier than Don Quixote?"
He's always been my favorite! Ive never watched anything that wasn't funny.When he was with Cube,Hart,and the driving student 😂 funniest thing ever
What an animal
If you've never seen Conan before and don't know anything about him and this is your first impression you'd think he's insane ngl. Great interview
That's no doctor! That's Jose, the host of "Jose shoots Chilling with Francisco!" One of Boliviguay's top shows! His fried cheese bauls recipe is the best!
I witnessed greatness.
i have a feeling those nips are ON FIRE
Watching it again feels like Chernobyl
I think Conan won hot wings 😅
I think I screamed “Conan stop stop stop” at least 100 times at my phone during this whole interview
Best one yet
This is the episode I've seen in years. Conan is incredible.
“Dr Arroyo, he’s not the best, but..he’s very affordable”
I wish someone could have followed him for the next two hours. Id watch it
Favorite episode by far
We have a new character, "Dr.Arroyo" 😂
a master of comedy at work
That was EPIC!!! 🤣🤣🤣
you needed Conan he brought back the old vibe of the show unlike these big shot super stars who take only a sniff and half a bite not committed unlike the early season when it was a disgrace to leave some meat on the bones
The way I just love this man in everything he does
Jesus srsly how did CONAN pull this off ???
Hahahahaha that was so funny , Conan is a legend can't wait for his new show
The zoom in on the sauces spilling 😂 23:51
conan just took the show to another level!!physch!
Conan is a madman and I love it!  This is my new favorite episode and I hope you guys get Danhausen to be a guest in the future
The greatest hot ones performance ever
This episode was CHAOS. Conan is the funniest man on earth.
Absolute insanity!!! Lets go Conan!!!
Oh my God. I've tried Da Boom. How is he not dead
No one, and I mean no one is better the Conan
Absolute legend.
God, this was awesome.
Absolute madness 😂
Conan you are the KING!!!
Sean was thrown off.  Who wouldn't have been....
RELEASE THE BTS CONTENT
17:18 I think this is the first time I've seen Sean nearly die of laughter while hiccuping. 😂
good lord this is the first time i've seen sean struggle to keep up with a guest. and i'm not talkin about the wings. 😅 god i love that conan guy.
He is in pain still
Go Conan!
Genuinly Funny !
a monumental episode
"Check my pulse" "it's there" 🤣😂😂
😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉he’s mad w hot sauce
Legend !
Dear God, Conan is great. What a blast. He's like the manic street preacher of comedy.
Dude Conan murdered it!
Robin Williams would be so proud. I feel like this was a homage to him.
Conan just put every Hot One's guest ever to shame
Conan is the fucken best dude lol
I bet he wished he had brought a doctor with him
THE GREATEST GUEST OF ALL TIME
I loved this fever dream
7:45 i nearly choked on my DBZ edition of Reese's Puffs 😅
Conan just gave us a master class in comedy and professionalism
Conan O'Brien is an absolute legend. 61 and still so funny and relevant. GOAT
Wow he is 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉exploding w heat
Conan looks great!!! Loved this episode!
I'm SO excited for this episode!!!  Edit: back for my second watch - surpassed every expectation I had. Incredible.
Conan is best.
Conan worried about them getting his DNA , we want the clones Conan, just let it happen
I have way more respect for Conan now than I did before this episode. This episode was INCREDIBLE!!!!
HE IS THE GOAT!!!!!
Shut it down. Hot Ones has reached critical mass 💥😂
FUH!  This is by far the best episode EVER!
My favourite episode of all time
Best. Guest. Ever.
I would’ve loved to see a Sona behind the scenes camera reacting to this performance live.
"welcome to the satanic movie awards"-conan o brien
Why did this make me tear up?
Conan O’Brien Versus Gordon Ramsey On First We Feast Would Break The Internet 😂
I know I am the odd one out, but this episode didn’t do it for me. Conan just wasn’t funny and he undermined the authenticity of the show/interviews.
This was LITERALLY one of the best things I've ever seen.
About time conan showed up lol
I cant believe he doused with da bomb 🤣🤣
This is BY FAR the most impressive thing I've ever seen on this show. He literally drank the last dab...
I hope Conan lives to a Biblical Age of 800
He must have taken one of those tabs that shuts off your spice receptors on your tongue.
Sean with that lightening speed Edward R. Murrow reference was brilliant
How did he not die? Insane
What a freakin’ lunatic, he’s gotta tone it down. Conan was fine though.
Absolute carnage. Absolutely amazing. I am in awe of this episode. Oh my god.
This was not an episode; it was an experience.
God tier
That is the greatest episode of the show ever. What a pro.
I love the moment where Conan so sincerely asks Sean "WHY CAN'T I FEEL?!"
I swear to God History was made today
Inspiring. I would follow Conan into any battle!
If Encyclopedia Brown taught be anything it’s that O’Brien drank candle wax.
Another classic episode. Up there with Ramsey. Excellent work.
GOATED
Conan is keeping the wings so he’s not framed with DNA
Best episode in a long time.
Gotta love Conan!! This might be my favorite episode
Unbelievable!!! 😂❤
Unhinged and amazing!
That is in the top few of the best Hot Ones I have watched. Way to end the season......
Get Matt from Demolition Ranch.
F I N A L L Y
17:25 Conan is so white he turned water into milk
Instantly a Mt. Rushmore level episode.  Gave me Coolio vibes with how hard he went, but then he actually handled it.  Best episode in years, by far.
Best episode ever. I don’t care what anyone says
🤣🤣
It’s just Max.  lol. 😝 I miss HBO.
As expected EPIC episode!
He is the definition to the term "a force of nature" ❤
Conan is the greatest guy ever.
What a sauce mess! 😂
Had to be the best ever
Absolute entertainment
Where can I buy Conan's jacket? Preferably without hot wings in the pockets.
Arguably the best episode to date.
KEDEKAI !
been watching this show for years and this is in the top 3 up there with Tommy Chong haha love it
😂
The best interview on hot ones till date.
Amazing hahahaha
i still think conan is the best late night show host
Crushed it
23:50
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conan O'Brien = subscribe to channel
This show has officially peaked.  There’s only one way to go after that performance.
That last answer/plea/speech was epic.
when Conan drank the hot sauce Sean looked so petrified of what was happening
GOAT guest, this was a thrill to watch.
But where is Jordan?
Come on 2 million views for this guy in 24 hrs. I'm shocked  to know hes that popular. Who knew.
Why are they sitting so far apart?
Conan relevance count
and THAT is how you dominate the wings of death. Absolutley INSANE performance! Future guests take note.
Should've dropped this episode on April 18, on his bday.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I'll ❤ you Conan 💖
Oh, it's building
Amazing!! 😄
Conan is the best!!!!
Conan truly is the GOAT. A legendary entertainer and by the sounds of it, a one of a kind man, friend and colleague!
a consumate professional. jesus christ.
I am in tears 😂
L E G E N D A R Y ! ! !
Best one yet. The energy he has is inspiring. Can't wait to see his new show.
Conan is freaking wild lol  The guy is akin to Robin Williams ... always on. Never turns off.  Just incredible.
Conan takes the 👑
Sean legitimately looks worried & kinda scared!! 😅
Greatest guest yet
He came he conquered whata Legend this is the best episode ever
"I went to announce my mistakes upfront." Gold.
Probably the best episode yet.
Dude a legend
I never watched much of Conan.   Always assumed he was another copy & paste. A Jimmy Fallon.   This made me a fan.
thats going to hurt him all to the way to the bathroom.
Coke has this guy not feeling anything...lol
Okey best guest ever!!!
wow
José Arroyo isn’t just a brilliant writer, he KILLED it as a fake doctor.
I respect Conan’s commitment, but I don’t share his humor at all. Am I completely alone here? It feels like I am. Still, an impressive display of eating wings like a literal maniac!
Bro too many quotables 😂🤣😂 my lizard brain is very satisfied
Biblical
Conan and Dave grohl are half the Hot Ones mount Rushmore
Best Episode ever
Connan: You’re not a doctor right? Dr. Arroyo: I should be Connan: ok 😐  😂😂😂😂
this by far the best episode of Hot Ones. An the funny thing is, Sean knew it was happening early in the episode and the entire crew witnessed history on that day.
This episode won’t be topped. No celebrity is this crazy and hysterical. 😅
CONAN for president. This is a record book episode for sure.
YOU NEED TO GET LETTERMAN! YOU NEED TO GET LETTERMAN! YOU NEED TO GET LETTERMAN!  YOU NEED TO GET LETTERMAN!
I'VE NEVER FELT SO ALIVE
I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at one of your episodes, this is just pure gold. That's why Conan is one of the best.
YESS COCO!!
i have never seen sean more terrified for a guest, bravo you two... bravo
The LEGEND!🎉
Did they keep sayin the show release date different every time? 😂
Sean was tryly impressed by Conan.
Easily the greatest episode in the history of the show. Conan....is simply on another level. So happy you had him on.
“I admire a guy who hosts hot ones and wears beautiful suede” 😂 this episode was the best!
at 21:00 onwards, I personally see flashes of Conan channeling Robin Williams on stand-up. Yeah this is definitely up there as one of the best Hot Ones episodes ever.
Literally the greatest talk show hosts together on one episode right here.
messy
I did not know those chairs could spin. Thank you Conan
Conan's here Finally!!!!!!
Gotta give it to Conan. Man’s a legend!
This was like interviewing 2 different people. Conan before 16:30 and Conan after 16:30
Conan is the GOAT
dude i legit gave a standing applause when he went on that monologue
Conan did the entire show by himself
Conan is mad. I love it!
Ive never clicked faster
oh yeaaaaa the myth the legend did it like a walk in  the park
This Conan guy is going places
Ranveer Singh needs energy lessons from Conan
ok, I was getting sick to my stomach with how bad Conan looked at the end of this..
Bravo Conan.. Thought for sure he was gonna clear the table with his arm 😊
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
One word great episode 😂😂😂
Phenomenal
We need a follow up from the bathroom the next day
The amount of times I yelled "CONAN NO! NO! CONAN STOP" when he poured more sauce only to see him demolish the wings better than anyone ever has.
Conan is crazy 😅😅😅 love him😂😂😂
Please get Sona on
He is even keeping food for his family for later. What a good catholic man!
This time Conan made sure the cameras were rolling before jumping on the water buffalo.
Man I love Conan he cracks me up every time I see one of his videos. Hands down he was the best late night show host who is genuinely funny. Even in his podcast he manages to make laugh
Conan is a god! What a comedic genius, just came over and took over the show!  Also so real for calling out Warner for the dumb HBO to max change.
I ate a bag of hot Cheetos and a half a bottle of tequila last week and I’m still feeling it today…. He’s gonna need a real doctor cuz I’m sure the other one is just gonna pour more sauce down his throat
Show Idea: Kalus and Conan eating hot peppers and telling old corny jokes 😂😂😂😂😂
Loved how he talked about the late night question and he went, letterman said not much and the “other guy” HAHAHA
This is the best episode ever! 😂😂😂
By the end of the show Connan was channeling Chris Farley
😂❤
Season finale? Might as well call it a series finale and close shop because there is no way such a feat can be topped! Drinking from the bottle? WOW!!!! Conan has been hilarious for quite some time but now he is at the top of Mount Olympus!
I just thought of Jordan doing hot ones lasting 4 hours just from asking about each hot sauce.
I’m in awe! Literally yelling at my screen “nooo you’re going to die!!! OMFG!!!” People who don’t know him will be like WHO THE F IS THIS GUY!? While those who do will say… Man I Miss Him! lol  Unbelievable!!
Best thing I've seen in a long time!!! Thanks for the laughing tears.
RIP Conan
Hero.
It's giving "Saturn Devouring His Son", by Goya vibes for me.
CRAZYYY
I'm surprised it took him until the last sauce for his face to turn red
This was the best one. And there is A LOT of Hot Ones.
release the uncut footage! this is comedy gold! Ive been watching this episode on repeat all day! Honestly the best guest of all time
What an absolute G! Plenty of belly laughs, Conan is a legend.
How is this FUNNIER the second watch through!
An absolute maniac. A mad genius. Team Coco for life.
He is not funny and has never been funny. Pretentiously brings his personal doctor on set then proceeds to disrespect him
Best.Episode.Ever.Period.
Best episode ever!
Conan is the peak of late night hosts.
Warrior blood for sure!
He reminded me of Chris Farley at the end.
This man out Stevo’d Stevo
Best episode ever!
Thank you for the laughs, conan and sean. May you both stay healthy and live a long fullfilling life <3
PEAK
I love Conan O’Brien so much
They should call this the series finale and end it. The show has peaked :D
Isn’t that the guy that works with Jordan Schlanski?
Conan is hilarious, wish he still had his show.
Woooo
Best episode ever
He is the ultimate entertainer
The second I seen Conan was the guest, I knew it was gonna be great. And Hotones, filled with really great interviews, this was in fact, the greatest most hilariously entertaining interview ever 😂
Lol, wherever Conan goes, he runs the show. 😂
GOAT
This may be my favourite episode of Hot Ones ever. The chaos. The yelling. Sean climbed aboard the Conancoaster and he's happy to be alive.
Conan is the goat his charisma and absolute brilliance is amazing. He does not shy away from looking silly as he is being himself.
He went full Rick & Morty at the end with the speech 😂
Hands down funniest episode! 🤣
This may be my favourite interview I’ve ever watched
Conan may be the most entertaining person of our generation
God this is better than I could have ever hoped for. Literral tears of laughter for the last 10 minutes xD
Best guest ever 😂
Conan just wrote in Dr. Nick riviera
His lips are the only indicator that the spice works. XD
"Call the wife!" 💀
This might be the best episode of Hot Ones EVER
Yo...this is legit my best episode!!
I love Conan so much! I have been a huge fan for years and this proves why.
Sean will any future guest feel as interesting as this?? 😂😂 might as well end the show here 😂
I definitely haven't seen this yesterday during dinner time. I'm saving this treat for tomorrow, when I will be watching with my buddies from work.
The absolute best episode, Coco for president, governor, Queen of England…Give this man whatever, he deserves it!
conan is an international treasure
So both Conan and Jack Black have been attacked by a Water Buffalo while trying to ride them! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conan is the best
Conan is a international gem
It'sssss insane! Outraaaageoussss!!!  I love it!!! ❤❤❤😂😂😂
If there was ever an exact example of "doing a 180⁰" it would be comparing this to your icespice episode. It's like comparing a moldy dying orange to a peak seasoned, crisp, & juicy apple right off the tree.  I don't find myself seeking out or thinking about Conan O'Brien content, but this was delivering  and rehabilitating for your Hot Ones show. I may give Conans show on max a shot. I salute your colon, Mr.O'Brien 🫡
Pepper X might be pure extract, but Conan is pure comedy. Refined through a hundred years of making people laugh endlessly.
conan is the GOAT
Conan channeled his inner Chris Farley towards the end lol
😂😂😂
I love him
Er. Muh. Gerd. Like a lot of people I’m sure, having painstakingly struggled my way through the traditional gauntlet feeling like Frodo as he climbed Mt Doom from the weight of the spice, I have a special appreciation for the utter insanity I just witnessed.   Arnold and Momoa are fully obsolete. O’Brien just showed the world who the real Conan the Barbarian is 😂
Conan is a comedy genius, that man is hilarious! one for the record! I can literally watch this over and over
The late night show host we need
truly the no.1 GOAT guess👑👑
Likely the best interview yet!
Why was he doing a bit the whole time 😭😭😭😭
Best one yet!!! 🔥 ❤
he is proof that gingers actually can be sucessfull
25:31 is the most authentic conan face in the whole video. "IS THIS APPLAUSE I HEAR FOR ME?? DID I DO WELL??" I love this man and have been ingesting his content for over 20 years
One of the best episodes ever. I love Conan, been following him since the Late Night days.
Conan is by far the best.
The g.o.a.t
That was incredible holy cow😂
I miss Conan O'Brien Late Night. He was far funnier than Jay Leno that the rest.
Cancel the show, end on a high note, this is the ceiling
Was there not a 9th question? 😂
Best season finale ever!!!
Man knows how to deliver a show!
Hands down the funniest episode of Hot Ones🔥🥵 EVER!!
I like O`Brien, but he's now mostly just talking about his past career and nostalgia, like, all the time.
Undoubtedly the single greatest episode yet. All hail Conan
He really is the greatest talk show host of all time and one of my top favorite comedians regardless of medium.
I can't wait to hear about the aftermath because I know his description will be funny
Best guest period 😂
Conan is the only late night host that I ever liked. He brings out the humor in people that you normally wouldn't think are hilarious
Conan’s gonna steal Sean’s job 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Incredible legendary performance
An American treasure - Conan
I don't even have a comment. <Salute>
Haha this was the best! Can't wait to watch the show on HBO Ma..... I mean Max. Cause that just rolls out of the tongue🤣
Wow. What an episode!
I like him but never guessed he would be be such a horrible guest.
This was possibly my favorite episode ever. He's so good. I was laughing so hard my family actually gathered around me to see what the fuss was about.
First wing drop in hot one’s history
thats why he is tge goat
It usually really annoys me when guests have a high tolerance and instead of commenting on the flavor, all they have to say is "ItS NoT SpIcY!"... This is the only time it did not bother me one bit! 😂😂😂 *Clicks replay*
Hes is the GOAT
Best. Episode. Ever.
Sometimes, it pays to be descended from Irish poverty.
Feel like Conan mignt be a personal hero of Seans, he has a nervous energy im not used to seeing when he interviews people
Madness, Da Bomb!
I'm sorry Hot Ones, but you're done. Conan broke the format. You have reached the summit; it's only downhill from here.
Conan is one of the greatest comedians I've ever seen. His consistent efforts and successes through the years have brought me more laughter than anyone else.
GO VEGAN!
Conan is a treasure.
Conan is the Funniest Host. He is the GOAT!!😂
Best episode you’ve done
He starts so composed and by the end, his performance is downright mesmerizing! Great episode! One of the few that when I finished the episode I immediately watched it again. Instantly one of the best ones 😊
That was chaos. Ballsy, but chaos.
Ok Conan you win, I’ll watch your new show now 😂
My favorite episode next to Charlize Theron
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Did Conan just say let's go buffalo!!😂 go bills!!
What do you call it when your hero becomes your new hero?
@23:12 😂
Of course Conan is the greatest guest in Hot Ones history. Why would I think it could turn out any other way?
The GOAT 🐐 🙌 Comedic magic. I've never laughed so hard at an episode of Hot Ones. Conan is on 🔥 😂
Did anyone check on Conan after this? I’m expecting any moment to see Conan has passed away
Now listen...I'm not saying that Conan O'Brien is a mad hatter but he's an absolute legend. One of the best episodes! Cheers!
Conan is the GOAT
No doubt he is the GOAT guest
Perhaps the most off the hook episode ever
What's up with the one bite than shoving it in your pocket? Cheater....cheater....cheater
"Call the wifeeeee". 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thats just FULL ON CONAN OFF HIS NUT....HILARIOUS 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conan is a gangster
Heck yeah that was theNest I have seen yet
What an episode
Top host
I love this episode but the editors have to stop putting music like this 1:23 in if the guest is clearly doing comedy at this moment. In general I find hot ones music often too sappy.
Lol, only Conan would do all 10 wings with ketchup!
Conan is so underrated. Pure genius
Homer Simpson chilli pepper comp
This was so funny love it
he's dying
Loool I just rewatched it and loved it even more.  I love how Conan paused and praised Sean. "This is important" to say....  They're both awesome
😮
Conan is definitely the final boss.
Conan is truly the goat
Fantastic!
Best interview ever!
why does he keeps the wings in his pocket? ...... 🤮 this is disgusting
Conan is sooooo HOT
I've seen nearly every episode and nearly all are great. But this was amazing, possibly one of the best ever.
That has to be watered down.
Conan killed it man
If this wasn't a meme worthy goldmine in the making I dont know what is.
Conan is so feral 😂
Liza and Family are very fortunate. ❤
Legendary!
I propose..: You guys should give Golden Wing to Conan!
Hmmm the Irish can handle da bomb…that’s amazing. Great work Conan!
I admire a guy who hosts Hot Ones and wears beautiful suede 😂
Incredible
Conan is hilarious!!
Conan went full Master Shake by the end there
You gotta love Conan ❤😂
When will you interview Nardhuar??
LEGENDARY ❤
Conan is the GOAT 🤣
Wow his mentality on traveling really shined through on Haiti
And Conan wins hot ones
I’ve never seen Sean so off his game 😂 Conan is a machine
CHAOTIC. What an interview lol
I have watched Conan since 1995. This is Conan at is best. To all youth now a days, his advice about Comedy applies to everything in life. Narrow minded people do not excel. 2.5 million views in less than 24hours has got to be a Hot Ones record.
Undoubtably one of the best ever episodes.
That's a professional!
Absolutely brilliant interview 👏 love conan he's one of the best talk show hosts of his generation and to see him being on this show is the cremè de la creme.
The greatest episode so far
What an F’n BEAST!!!
👏👏👏
I love Conan!!😂😂
No doubt one of, if not the best episode. Conan went off the walls and im here for it.
it's a known fact that coke neutralizes capsaicin  edit: Conan should do a vs. battle with Steve'o
The GOAT
King Coco!
This is incredible! I was sitting and laughting our loud. It's happen really rarely!
totally unhinged just like we love it
The pain and suffering Conan will endure for a laugh. He is a comedy Savant.
Conan is the GOAT !!!
best episode ever
what made him show up again?? he have a new show?, book? movie to promote??? he been hiding and doing podcast for last x years
Legendary. Conan, your commitment to entertain inspires me. Thank you so much.
lol
Really great episode! But I think you got four years tops.
YEEEEESSSSSD
I never comment but Conan is a comedic genius and he will always be the best of the best!!
Conan gave Sean great compliments about being a fantastic interviewer, then proceeded to turn the interview completely sideways. Amazing.
I will not be surprised to learn that Conan dropped dead shortly after this taping.  I can't tell if he's having a nervous breakdown or he just craves attention to the point of semi-accidental suicide.
The single most entertaining thing I've seen in my entire life.
Conan is a straight up beast.
I can see that Conan has great respect for Sean
Should have brought Jordan Schlansky
Happy soon birthday Conan, hands down best talk show host of all time 🙂 and next time I need to see schlansky here 😂😂
The worst thing a guest can do is bring their own Doctor for comedic relief.
Made Everyone Before Look Like A Whimp. Team Coco for the W
Conan the GOAT! Absolute legend!
Best Hot Ones episode ever.
I'm glad I was alive to see this
Brooooo he said can I keep these pockets a chicken wing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As soon as Conan's new show was announced I actually wrote down on my schedule the time of the first episode so I don't miss it. 😂
This is the best episode I’ve ever seen of this show!!! I laughed hilariously
Conan gives a new meaning to "The spice must flow"! 🤣🤤😀
Amazing
Conan the goat. Instant click ❤
Sean gives his guests spicy food so the guests can't run their normal interview game. This time Conan completely turns the game upside down so now Sean can't run his normal interview game. Haha one of the best episodes! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best episode ever 🔥🔥🔥🔥
At leaat this is better than Ice Spice
Tears....im in tears.. this is too funny. Conan is the man  😂
Saving the bones. Genius!
Legendary.
Legendary hot ones performance. Gonna go in the books as the anti dj khaled
Conan at the end like, ‘you wanna know how I got these scars’
Conan is the craziest hot ones guest ever, please knight him
His episode in Murderville prepared him for this.
Ami the only one who thinks conan looks like a mix of Donald Trump and Bryan Cranston?
Conan is king of hot ones 💪
Love this guy
Sean is going to have a hard time eclipsing this episode
Idk why but Conan's "wani wana wani" chant always cracks me up
Episode was so good I gave him a standing ovation at the end.
CALL THE WIFE 😂
Unbelievable. So good.
Crushed it just like he does everything!!😂
Conan looks so high at the end! =D
Coco do good
Watch out you mere peasants! The King as arrived!!!!
Conan sounded like Master Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force on that final rant there 😂
Conan was last dabbing mostly all the wings lol
Fun fact, Conan the Barbarian was created in honor of Conan O'Brien.
Pure unrefined classic Conan.
After you see the end, go back and look at his calm and professional response to the introduction. 😂
I'm here for Coney. I don't like watching people eat and talk, but I'll watch anything that Conan is in.
This is right up there with the Dave Grohl and Aubrey Plaza episodes!
love how many views this already has. Conan's still got it
I hate to say it. This is the pinnacle. It’s all downhill from here
My God! He's my hero 😂 That's actually insane what a legend
This is the best hot ones episode and I have watched them all!
Conan F'ing KILLED IT. impressive such a master of masters in show business. this is prolly the best episode ever.
The genius of Conan. Committing wholeheartedly to the bit - not for himself - but for us, the audience. He lays it all out and brings it to life, magically. We’re so lucky.
His lips are so red😂
😂Jesus, that guy is funny
Warren G Harding also got a child pregnant in a white house closet and lied about until his death but, DNA proves her grandchildren are related to his family. Unmistakable proof.
That was somehow WILDER than Steve-O
Always be my hero
Couldn’t help wavering between impressed and concerned lol
It's impossible not to love this dude!
What an entertainer, wow I love him
"My pocket is getting full" 🤣
Doctor Arroyo feeling for Conan's Pulse: it's there  This had me in stitches
23:49 that pan up from the mess he made is gold
I miss Conan.  he's a blue eyed red head.  we don't feel pain.
Conan is the antidote to DJ Khaled
👍👍
Best episode ever!
See how civilized Conan is at 0:38 and then jump to 24:56 to see how the hot wings have transformed him!
Just another shred of proof that Conan is and always will be a legend
Pure masterpiece
Man he is from another planet, yet from another galaxy!!!
He's going to regret all that when he goes to the bathroom.😂
This is my favorite Hot Ones EVER!! I was tearing up from laughing so hard. Love Conan!
Now that Gordon Ramsay and Conan O’Brien have done Hot Ones, who are we all rooting for to be a guest on this?
When Conan is on the show is Conan's
''The Buffalo hot sauce contains everything but buffalo.''
I went to a Conan taping in 2004. He came out to greet the audience beforehand and was incredibly hilarious and charming. Conan is the greatest.
NOW THATS WHAT I CALL, an actor!!
Not gonna lie...felt like drinking some hot sauce straight from the bottle after watching this
Conan, have your reward, you won the show and set the bar for seasons to come. We salute you!
There is nothing so humanizing to our heroes than Hot Ones.
Since you got Conan, you guys gotta try to get his biggest fan, the wrestler Danhausen on, and see if he can stay in character the whole time.
Best episode
Protect this man at all costs 🙏
been waiting for this since day 1. thank you
These are two of the nicest interviwers EVER!
The greatest spicy gem on Youtube!
Conan never disappoints!!! Wing drop!!!
Insane that we can watch this for free, I loved Conan as a host. Never expected him to be on hot ones, and to my pleasant surprise it was my personal best so far
I mean, does anyone even have the right words to describe this episode? It was, um, something. Just pack your things and give Conan the keys to the studio!
Conan just defied the usual of Hot Ones... He's a maniac!
Finally!!!! Coco!!
Loved it!
Conan's on the different level when it comes to to the entertainment stage. 5 seconds in, I hit the like button already.
How does Conan just saunter in here and become the best guest of all time!?!
whoever did Conan's makeup should be fired
Absolutely fantastic. This has got to be one of the episodes ever.
Can we go back to the guest sharing the same table and not sitting so far away
you know how a lot of people love Robin Williams? I don't for the most part.  I found him a little too manic a lot of the time. This is missing the mark for me also.
Weird hearing Conan talk without a crowd laughing
Arroyo STILL works with CoCo??! Geez i am ancient.
It amazes me how Conan and his comedy stays so fresh and never gets corny or stale. He adapts to the times 😄 I love his skits
Can we get shane gillis
Greatest episode ever!!! Love conan. Cant believe he left with all of the wings in his pocket 😂😂😂
GOD what an epic episode
Shut the shop. No-one can beat this performance!
This is hands down the best Hot Ones interview I've seen. Conan is an incredible performer and conversationalist
Best episode ever. The delivery of “Mistake!… I like to announce my mistakes up front” almost took me out.
This video reminds me of what a comedic hero that Conan has been over the decades...
Love, Conan, he’s wearing a little too much makeup, he’s looking a little too “gold” or “orange”, lol. Sort of Trumpish, lol.
Best episode ever
GOAT for a reason
😂😂😂
This is pure magic Conan is a legend!
Best. Episode. Ever. (mic drop)
Um, CONAN is the greatest
This is easily one of the greatest episodes in Hot Ones history (if not the greatest). Instant classic!
I saw conan and clicked.
I think Conan is just trying to die xD
Am I the only one who thought Conan was just trying way too hard and it ended up being a bit cringey?
Conan is just pure gold! The man just owns everything he does.
Conan dumping Da bomb on his wing is like watching the water buffalo incident in real-time.
That's commitment!
Man, that Jose is a trick of all trades - writer, ophthalmologist in Australia and now some sort of general practitioner.
I need to get ready for work but im just smiling and staring at my screen. Didnt know how much we needed this episode!
He is so good 😂😂😂😂 the true dont give af guy. Love him
Coco❤
All Hail Conan!
I didn't even watch and I know that Conan will run his mouth and then regret it haha  // UPDATE: I couldn't be more wrong and I couldn't be happier
Conan goes full Tom Green
I love conan o'Brien. He pushed the envelope on his talk shows. The year 2000 was my favorite bit of all time as a kid
The GOAT and Conan O'Brien
Andrew Tate can step aside. Conan is the new top g
Conan put to shame all the prissy celebrities who have to nibble their wings- literally dousing his with da bomb and licking it clean. The man is a legend.
Hands down the best episode ever
Sean has always said he tries to match what the guest does with each bite. I didn't see Sean wash his hands in The Last Dab. Cmon, Sean. You're slipping.
That was so magnificently unhinged 😂😂😂
best interview ever!!!
Loving this, Conan is the best!
That was incredible. Thank you both
This was probably the best episode ever
that was the greatest show of hot wings ever
This is… the best episode
Conan is a redhead. He is literally going to die. He's simply not going to make it after POURING ON the last dab. It's been nice knowing you, Conan.
What did i just watch??? 🤯
What a absolute LEGEND . Bravo Sean for bringing in one of the funniest cable-network comedy show hosts in TV history ! Great episode to finish of the season finale .
This is the best episode ever.
Conan's unhinged speech about how there's comedy everywhere and how we should look high and look low is honestly one of the most motivational and beautiful things I've heard in a while.
By the end it felt like a very strange remake of the Blade Runner final scene with Rutger Hauer
a dream come true
Conans right Don Quijote is quite funny
👍
Fresh
the best guest by far
Calling Jay Leno “the other guy” still is why I love Conan. Holds a grudge while taking the high road 😂
Conan is still INSANE!😂😂😂😂😂 love it!!!
I’ve seen hundreds and hundreds of episodes but this… is pure S-Class. Amazing
Greatest talk show host of all time
There have been many great Hot Ones episodes...  I think this one is my favorite.
The goat late night show host.
Penultimate wing was so wild Sean couldnt even get a question in 😂😂😂😂
Best episode ever
ok who fed conan copious amounts of acid right before he was due to appear on camera? great work! lol
I audibly gasped half a dozen times with Conan slathering, drinking, and bathing in the sauces
im gonna be honest i really expected him be to sip right from the bottle at one point but still got shooked when he actually did 😂
Conan just dunked on this show. A true performer.
ITS NOT A BIT. THIS IS LIFE 😤😤😤😡
This might be better than Gordan Ramsay
One and only Conan...love the guy....and this is by far the best episode i have seen
This is one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen. Middle aged man trying to stay relevant with the kids and having a breakdown.
"Get a baseline pulse."  "You're just choking me."  "You just feel for the pulse."  "Yeah it's there."  "He's very inexpensive."  I'm crying laughing
This one is one of the best episodes! Conan is such a funny guy!
Thank you for this
Amazing ep I love Conan 😂😂
I haven't see that much white stuff pour out of a person's mouth since Ripley plugged Ash back in after knocking his head off.
Conan is an original great
I swear the end of this episode was EXACTLY like the end of a Rick and Morty season 😂 please tell me someone else feels that vibe
Amazing episode! Love to see Conan still going at it!
Showman through and through. Incredible chaotic interview with great flow . Can’t describe it any other way.
prob the greatest show u guys have ever done~ !!
Masterclass
Love how he referred to Leno as "the other guy".
Guys we finally have seen Conan high
nahh nah nah nah he can’t come on here and make the best episode ever.. can he?
This is proof that gingers can actually handle pain...
its true then, red heads feel very little pain
Why is Conan so annoying
Conan is always so effortlessly funny 😂😊
This is the best episode…and the second best  don’t even come close…he is built different
I was so not expecting when Conan called his doctor to pocket a wing. 🤣
I love Conan so much. Dudes always so unhinged. I’d give anything to hangout with him for a day lol
Conan is such an entertainer
Epic
I think this masterpiece beats even Gordon Ramsey episode!
How was Conan the youngest ever guest on the show at 61 years old?
Speechless 😮 one of the greatest episodes ever 💯💯💯
Conan O'Brien really needs a friend 😂 What a legend
i totally get why he complimented sean being a great interviewer. all of his questions were very specific and unique
The greatest hot ones of all time.
Legend
Just when you thought you’ve seen it all, this man makes you laugh harder than ever. Conan is such an amazing person my god, he is relentlessly funny
Conan responding to " what book do you recommend to show that the building blocks of comedy are not at all new"  With "there's comedy in the old testament there's comedy in the new testament" is the most Catholic thing ever
Drinks hot sause like a water. Has a signature hair curl. His job is related to journalism. Ladies and gentlemans, this is Clark Kent IRL.
This was so uncomfortable but I couldn’t stop watching haha
“You say this is pure pepper??” 😂😂😂😂 Conan is the best.
best hot wings ever
Arguably the greatest Hot Ones episode, hands down 🐐
Best episode. Period. And the shot here at 23:45 hot sauce slowly pouring out of the bottle, Conan waving another bottle around *chef's kiss*
By far, best hot ones interview ever 😂😂😂😂
Conan is hands down the funniest talk show host ever. Right now, nobody even comes close.
Conan doesn't know what spice is!
This episode was an acid trip
Conan is the best; he made me laugh despite my anxiety and depression.
What an end to the season ❤
Best hot ones ever
And just like that, Conan made Hot Ones HISTORY. *Standing ovation* p.s.: low key, I'm worried about his health after this 😅 WE LOVE YOU, CONAN 🙌🏻✨️❤️‍🔥
Best episode ever!
GOAT enough said
Co-nan oooooooo briiiien
HAHA Great Interview and finallee for 2023. I enjoyed your Jennifer Lawrence interview...she aced the wings also. Bill Burr and Dave Grohl were also good
good luck toping this one...lol
Eric Andre's interview seems incredibly tame compared to this one
I thought the she wolf was the close of the season Sean
This was a wild ride to say the least
I think the reason Conan was able to defeat all of the wings, is because he's a talkshow host and a writer. He knows how to be entertaining, but he also knows how to be a guest; he talks a fair bit on this episode, as opposed to media trained B list celebrities who have been on here - Sure, rhey know how to act, but watch them on a Wired Autocomplete Interview video then watch them here.... Conan isn't afraid to ve vulnerable.
He took it just a smidge too far, and for that, he's a legend. There will never be anyone like Conan.
This was way too good. His show on Max is gonna smash.
good ol' Conan. He's a national treasure :)
I’ve never seen an episode where the camera literally can’t leave the guest. He’s holding our attention with an iron grip.  One of the best episodes of all time.
This could be a SERIES FINALE because it’s never getting better than this. CONAN is Comedy. Great Episode.
Best host and the best host!!
ENTERTAINMENT at it's finest This Was AWESOME 😂☝️
Best one ever
The title should've been "Sean freaks out when Conan eats hotwings"
Conan comin in like a true showman.  I never cared about this happening but it's beautiful.
Thanks, Sean, for addressing the lean-in during the breaks
This is the best episode of Hot Ones
This was a present surprise
“The other guy…I don’t know where he was” 😂
One of the best episodes of Hot Ones!
Might be the best episode of all time
Both the most foolish, yet best Da Bomb, ever 😂 Love how Sean just let him after all his thrashing of the line up ❤
Conan definitely pulled the Homer Simpson move and drank a candle before coming on
God he was so funny, love Conan
This is the best episode yet
Conan said what I've always said about this show. The interviews are incredible. Every single guest comments on how good the questions are.
The next guests have big shoes to fill... Conan swung for the fences and hit a walk off grand slam.
This is the best guest on Hot Ones I’ve ever seen.
When youre so uninteresting that even Sean, can only ask talk show related questions.  When all you can give back is trying to be "all that", loud and "funny". I was really interested for this episode, but man Conan has nothing to offer
Conan is the Goat
2.6 mil in less than 24 hours.
1st place
Incredible
conebone69 is fearless
The subtle transition between silly and profound is what I admire the most about conan o'brien   Not only one of the greatest hosts, comedians in history, but also one the greatest personalities in history
Conan O’Brien.  The gingerest of angels.  🔥🐓🔥
Best episode EVER. Rules rewritten for the hot ones! EPIC
Conan O'Brien literally sip two bottle of sauce is the most chad moment in Hot Ones. Conan is an absolute legend ❤😂 😲
Hail the king of entertainment!
I just watched the whole thing a second time. Conan is King ❤‍🔥
I love every second of any Conan O’Brien interview. ☺️
I loved watching Conan back when I was I high school.  I would stay up and wait for his talk show.  Whenever my mom told me to just go to bed, I told her that the talk show host was a Harvard graduate… 😂 Team Coco for life！ 🎉🤩
best episode ever! ll
Well, Gordon isn't the wildest guest anymore.
The best to ever do it.
I got the S23 line up for a friend and I to try, we added a bottle of OG da'bomb (the heatonist box has reformulated sauce). It's all great, but, no lie, da'bomb does hit you like an absolute train. It doesn't build, it just punches you. I'm not saying it's all coasting down hill from there, but everything after is definitely more pleasant.
Conan ! respect
Best guest ever!!!!!
"Hi everybody" 👋
That was the funniest one I have ever seen!!
Outstanding, Conan at his finest... BRAVo!!!!!!!!
Legend
LOL what a legend 😅😅😅
that is how you put on a show, my goat
2 of the most iconic hairstyles in the business!
Dude is a legend!
It too me a while to realise that the Letterman "desk" Conan is talking about was his interview desk now his personal desk
Please publish a BTS of this episode
YOU CAN T BUT LOVE Conan YOU A LIVING LEGEND
Comes across as a big ego bell end
This is gold!!! Conan is such a great comedian!!! 😂😂
Favorite hot ones episode.
I think i just fell in love with connan ❤
That was the most Conan segment of all time. GOAT
Can you pls get Paige Bueckers or the whole UConn starting lineup on here??
I haven't watched Hot Ones in awhile now but I can say all the ones I watched, this is HANDS down the best one I've seen! 🎉
This is The BEST episode of all time!!!! (imho) I swear Conan is on another level of entertainment, shared by the greats that he mentioned. Thank you so much for this unbelievably epic episode!!!
20:55 KILLED ME 😂
Conan became the Joker in this bit.
Absolute legend
conan the wing king
How have they not released that buffalo footage, how much gold are they hiding ?
My theory is that his taste buds just deteriorated over the years
It's the water Buffalo all over again. He seems to just get caught up in the moment.
Multitalented, endearing, humble, experienced, hardworker
I just watched history being made.  I will literally always remember where I was when I watched this episode.
21:08
Gotta give it up for the guy that played Arroyo. His deadpan delivery was hysterical.
Best one ever
there should be a double jimmy episode now
Top 3 episode ever.
Absolute Legend 🙌 The best one so far 😄
Coco you crazy clown
this episode makes me wanna subscribe to you for the first time what a freestyle by conan <3
This will go down in history
“sometimes when you think it’s going to go very badly it goes well”
He’s high asf from the pain 😂😂😂😂
The look of fear and pain on Sean's face at 22:37 is so funny
The GOAT
Conan was on fire from the very beginning 😂 guys a master
Thats was an amazing episode 😂
This might be the greatest Hot Ones we've had so far!
We took this man for granted for far too long.
"Thank you for doing your research"
Waited way too long for this episode, and it was worth every second
He's acting like he just drank a liter of the original coca cola
Gotta love Conan!!!!
He was born 2 days before Hitler's birthday
been watching hot ones since season 1, this may be the BEST INTERVIEW IVE EVER SEEN. Conan understood the assignment, and delivered a performance thats as memorable as any of the best acting I've seen. CONAN IS A LEGENED, THERE ARE NO OTHER LATE NIGHT HOSTS (except Craig Ferguson, he was hilarious too)   Hats off to a true king.
I've seen Conan where that jacket quite a few times, and he must like it a lot and he stuffed it with wings for small a bit, thats Conan in a nutshell
Behold, for you have all witnessed the peak of entertainment. It goes no higher than this, you can never top it.
Top 5 of your show
He can call it"life" but it's still a bit, which IMO is way over the top and not typical Conan.  Kinda screams desperation.
Wow, Conan is Irish? I never head him mention that before
I lost it when he sipped the hot sauce. 😂😂😂
So many meme worthy moments.
How could you not love this kind of crazy person!
The smeared sauce on his face and acting more insane than usual - strong Joker vibes
This was hilarious
I think Conan gave YG some competition for the most resistance guest on hot ones.
I bet you live 4 more years. Tops.
Best one yet
This is the Best episode on this show!!
Nothing will ever match this, Conan is a legend for a reason. This might just as well be the final episode of the whole show.
Best episode ever! Conan is a legend!
so.... where can I find the water buffalo video ?
21:00 Unlocked Chris Farley mode.
hahahahaha okay, i was NOT expecting this.. he certainly beat Steve O's episodes!
Love this dude 😂
Conan and the people around him always say that he can do anything if he thinks it will have some comedy value. This is proof. Legendary episode
How is it that his face never  moves regardless of his mood? Its like dried cement
I love that he brought a character
Irish Legend)  Love you, mr. Fkn Legend Conan)
I came here for the Conan Unhinged. I got what I wanted.
Someone put this video in the Lourve…..!!
It doesn't feel like Conan was invited to Hot Ones, but Hot Ones was invited to the Conan show
That's a Legend right there.... Conan the Comedian!!  Seeing these too is like a passing of the Guard!
I liked Conan before, I like him even more
I've never seen a demon eat hot wings before. I like how he said you can't predict the future,  but  had a running bit doing so for the year 2000.😂
Now that's someone understanding the assignment. And what makes a good show.
I love this man
I have a feeling, this show for Conan is going to turn out to be like his Water Buffalo bit. He didn't say NO to the voice inside him that told him to, Go for it! Where's Andy when you need him.
Was he afraid of someone stealing his DNA?
The best episode 😂❤
I had high expectations. Conan managed to exceed them once again, just like he did for his entire career. The way he tackled those wings, he reminded me of another Conan, a certain Barbarian. Thank you for making us laugh so much over all these years <3
This might the best episode I’ve seen of this. Conan forever.
Utterly glorious.  Self righteousness Conan is my favourite.
The goat himself! Men will tell tales about his comedic genius, Children will sing songs about his greatness and all women will remember his tall, red head swan-like appearance. This video just proves that Conan truly is the greatest of all time🔥
Can’t beat pocket meat!
how is he 61 next week. hes like wine just gets better with age
They should have brought Jordan Schlansky on the show
The Best
I can picture it in front of my eyes: Sean, Chili Klaus and Conan are going to taste the next Carolina Reaper together...
Usually people go on Conan. You know you're cool when Conan comes on your show.
haha wing drop!!!
conan what a dude, a world treasure indeed.
Sean: why do I hear boss music?
He was channeling his inner robin williams
Conan’s right about Don Quixote - astoundingly funny for a 400-year old book.
the man has no contender
My respect for Conan O'Brien has, yet again, gone up massively from previous all time highs.
The cap cramps he is going to have are going to make him wish he didn't do that😂
My two favorite interviewers <3
Conan throwing himself in 100% like he always does. Absolute beast. Best episode yet.
The last great late night talk show host. The best episode of Hot Ones ever!
Geez, conan is completely fearless
Sean was in a snapback and jeans asking rappers about their experiences...now Conan O'brian is complementing him on his skills...if that's not inspirational IDK what is
best episode ever made. Hands down. Conan is the best
I've never seen anyone disarm Sean and the show like Conan just did. What a legend!
Cringe af
My stomach hurts from laughter, what a guy Conan is, cant wait for his new show!
I dont understand how a Late Night host can claim quality mattered more than quantity. Like, you had 5 deadlines a week. You were going to be on TV nearly every night of the week. Quality, necessarily, mattered less than just having a product to deliver.
Me personally, I prefer the more sincere interviews and there were some moments like that in here. The over the top screaming and flailing is not my thing, but I'm happy to see so many enjoyed the episode a lot and I'm surely not here to yuck anyone's yum. 😊 Conan is great and his pain tolerance is a sight to behold.
Best episode ever, easily
after 35 years of Conan.... YEAH! He's that NUTS! It's like watching a real life Home eating the Psychelic chili pepper!
This was gold
Not Dr. Arroyo taking the stetoscope on Seans tongue 😂😂😂
Conan is my hero! I had tears in my eyes
simply the greatest episode of Hot Ones, Conan is the GOAT and I can't wait to watch his new show after watching pretty much everything he was involved in
This officially beats kevin hart on my top appearance of all time.
21:05 my goodness, this got me rolling way too much
I am BEYOND impressed by Conan!! I thought like like all the others who’ve mocked the front end wings, he would regret his cockiness and be dying at the end like everybody else?? Conan is a BEAST!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
People seem to enjoy this shouting circus but I find Conan much funnier when he is more calm than this. Started well but ended badly.
Ugh, Conan we fkn ❤ you man.
absolutely bonkers. If he does something, he makes sure it's the best it can be
Conan is MENTAL!!
25:57 the stare into nothingness gets me everytime 🤣
Conan is THE OGGGGG
Obituary:         Conan O'Brien  The last living showman
this is an interview for ages, conan and shawn thank you're both legends
Best episode ever
He keeps the wings so they don't clone him
This is the best episode ever. Hands down.
It keeps getting Hotter! Great stars, fantastic show
The best episode ez
I need to see him on last meals
Conan is an absolute beast!
He killed the wings better than anyone i think
Conan gave Sean his flowers when he didn’t have to. Respect.
Best hot ones guest ever.  This was awesome.
Anyone else audibly gasp when he poured Da Bomb???? This man is one on my favorite humans
Conan was Da Bomb!!!
Whenever life gets me down i will now have this video to inspire me once more. I loce you Conan!!!
I've watched this 5 times already.
This is one of the best episodes ! 🤣🤣
2M views in 20h..?l
this might just beat Eddie Huang
Best guest ever
Conan is the best
In his own way, Conan channeled Robin Williams. Rest in hilarious, Mork.
Conan is the best to ever do iiiitttttt!!!!!! Couldn’t stop laughing from wing #1
This dude is so effortlessly funny 😂
Conan is the best to ever do iiiitttttt!!!!!! Couldn’t stop laughing from wing #1
I have never watched one of these twice... I'm about to 👍
Dude is chaos    I love chaos
Madness? This is CO-NAAAN! Conan you made me cry out of laugher for good 10 minutes straight! :D Thank you so much, made my day <3
This was amazing.
Conan was hilarious! Probably the best Hot Ones episode! I was in tears!
Best episode so far. Completely unhinged and I love it! I was completely dying at the end
Holy $hit!! The  best episode EVER, hands down!! EVER!!
Legendary. No one will ever top this.
Now thats how you cut a promo
Conan raises the bar yet again, hot ones been running for years and this has got to be one of the best episodes 😂
Argueably the best episode/guest yet.
Amazing.
Conon is amazing what a great episode this man is lit
The bar has been raised.
Conan and my mom share a birthday! What a great thing! Conan is king, I have seen all his live shows.
I've been a Conan fan since the early days and this was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  Not sure why this show exists or needs to exist, but that was priceless.
My god
21:12 this actually happened to me once, when i was a talk show host
Wow.
I love how you teased this guest and I was expecting someone huge and you delivered someone even better than I imagined. Love Conan!
By far, my favorite episode!
„Showbusiness is you’re getting the greatest show in the world.“  Conan told us that and delivered as he was speaking. 👏
The goat
Can this be a part 1?? Part 2 Conan returns with Ice Cube and Kevin Hart 😄
That was a man in pain, and we saw his soul and coping mechanism.
😂
That was hands down the best hot ones interview ever!! 😂😂😂😂
Nice Margiela jacket
That was actually unreal. I've got asthma from laughing so hard. Conan is the absolute best person for this show.
Named my son after Conan. Absolute legend.
This is genuinely one of the best episodes ever bravo hot ones
Probably the best guest ever on the show.  A true comedic genius.
Conan Wins!
Conan is one of those people I’m envious of because he never gets tongue-tied in a long conversation!
This was not a let down!
Conan is the greatest!!!!!!!!!!
y’all PLEASE bring Corey Taylor on here
Conan on hot sauce would make a great joker in Batman
Awesome!!!!
Conan in it means IM WATCHING IT. Period.
It’s not the way it goes in but the way it goes out that hurts the most
This is the hands down the greatest episode yet 😭
I mean they kinda have to shut the show down now, yeah? What is ever going to be on it that is better than this? Pack it up guys! Someone call Mikey Day!
Legendary 😂😂😂😂
Conan is brilliant, 'your not a doctor are you?' 'No I should be' 😂
Watching hot ones since the very first episode, this was by far the best, most entertaining episode of hot ones ever made.
When they showed him at the start I did think the bottom of his face was particularly red. Now I know why.
This is the best Hot Ones episode I have ever watched. I straight up clapped along with everyone at the end
Thank you, Sean. Thank you Conan.
Da Bomb moment: it was in this moment Conan realized, he done messed up.  What a natural entertainer. Never seen conans show, but this guy is amazing.
I’m screaming at the tolerance of the hot sauce.
CONAN IS THE ABSOLUTE GOAT OF SHOW BUSINESS
I'm in the middle of the show and it's the greatest thing ever!!! I love Conan!!!!😍😍😍
Got to give Conan a ton of credit, for a guy who grew up with zero spice… he did this episode with so much guts and style. Can’t help but how many tears and cries of anguish happened after the cameras stopped rolling though. Judging by the drool at the end there were many.
Sean quickly realized that he is Conan's guest now
Lol, Sean has indeed found the final boss
This episode is on the wall of greats. Like top 5 close to Gordon Ramsay and Shaq for me
"This is not a bit" says the guy who brought a fake doctor with him.  XD  Classic Conan.
And that’s …how you FEAST!!🎉❤ 👏
WOW Conan raised the bar!
Best Hot Ones episode ever. Conan is king.
Conan o Brian needs an  Imodium
The best episode 👌
Best episode ever. Conan is so funny
What a legend. That was absolutely insane.
This is the most impressive, scary, intense Hot Ones episode I think maybe ever
Dude has a weird tolerance to hot sauce
I knew he was going to overreact.  His reactions were always over the top during his shows.
Comedy gold with O'brien
Is conan really tall or sean just short ?
He’s my favourite American 🇺🇸
Love Conan 😂
This is why Conan is the late night king. 👑
What a legend
Best Hot Ones episode.
Shaun should of offered Conans Dr some hot hotwings. I think the poor man was a bit hungry after dealing with such a firecracker like Conan for 20 years or so🤣😅😂
Best one yet. 😂👏👍
Can you be less respectful for other countries? Not funny at all.
This was the best.. it will never be surpassed.
WOW, JUST WOW
"Wise words from a wise stable man" while he is ranting, peak comedy!
That was a great finale... Conan you're truly THE GOAT
RIP Conan
Epic
That was awesome.
Think Conan was such a considerate guest, especially when answering president related questions. Probably didn’t want to turn this into a political drama splitting the audiences and focused on joy and humour instead
Sean brought the wings, Conan brought the bits. What a legend!
Conan is hilarious 😂😂😂
Wing drop! New ending needed after the promo push from everyone!
Hardest I’ve laughed at something in a long time!! 😂😂😂
@16:46 you can hear the terror in Sean's "oh my god!" 😂
I love conan the sincerity in his comedy is un matched
Broooooooo!!!!!! Conan ate this.
the goat.what a episode.
Hands down the best episode, not even close.
Having seen 95% of all the episodes: this one even surpasses the one with Shaq. Comedy gold!
Why dont you guys do Matpat?
Best episode ever
He looks like someone who was Exorecised  😭🤣
First 2 minutes and I’m already crying laughing this was hands down the best hot ones episode 🤣
Conan! Conan! Conan! Conan! Conan! Conan! <3
I have watched Conan since I was in elementary school in 1993. What an absolute legend. One of the funniest people to ever live. Fun fact: he used to write for the simpsons back when it was the best show on television
Dude brought a fake doctor 🤣🤣 Never a day off for Conan O'Brien 👏🙏
This is easily the best episode of hot ones
guys i'm starting to think Conan O'Brien is not totally normal
This was one of the greatest episode of Hot Ones.
I'd like to see Conan meet Chili Klaus and Smokin Ed for a hot pepper tasting.
Conan just made a very solid argument for the GOAT guest for the show.
Man he could knock a Chris Farley bit out of the park
and so we understand why craig ferguson was the best; sill, impressive performance
This was incredible
Power rankings just got wrecked lol
This is absolutely unhinged. I love it. His bathroom will be in an interesting state later!
Conan chugging hot sauce likes it's lemonade. Absolute legend.
I haven't watched Conan O'Brien in a long while, and I wasn't prepared for the absurdity of it all.   I nearly choked on my food laughing🤣
Conan da 🐐
Mary said, there's something about his fringe. Right?😂
Hot ones now has hooks in Texas joe Rogan will be on this show within the year
We could have Conan committed but then the real doctors would call for his immediate release.
This is the best episode yet.
Best ever thanks Conan thanks Shaun and let’s remember the chickens and the drool
GREATEST EPISODE EVER!
Best Guest Ever!
Conan is such a goat. Will always be my favourite late night host
Conan is such a goat. Will always be my favourite late night host
after this interview i m scared of conan
The best yet !!
conebone69
Conan is awesome! 35 years in the biz, and still on top of his game.
Hands down. Best hot ones episode ever
Laughed so hard that I got teary-eyed. As expected from a veteran, legend, man, myth, and now, hot wing destroyer 🔥🔥🔥
Where can we buy Sean’s jacket?
I have tears of joy in my eyes. 😂
oh my god i haven't even watched the episode but Conan is the guest i never knew i wanted to see on Hot Ones until i see the thumbnail!! i'm so so excited to watch this during my meal time hehe
Such dedication
Conan is a king, this show has officially peaked
*This is certificate masterpiece.*
This and David Blain my fave two.
😂😂😂don't even know how 2 eat wings
How did the bottles fall over
What a barbarian
Carson; Letterman; O'Brien! Simple as. Conan is a giant and its no surprise to me that Dave has always had his back. Bonus mention for Craig Ferguson who, together with Conan, has been the most naturally funny late night host in history.  And this episode is already an all time great of Hot Ones. Well done team!
Best episode ever!
Conan: *becomes an unhinged red-faced maniac, screaming while covered in hot sauce*  Comment section: "What a dignified masterclass of showmanship and philosophy, bravo!"
Are these the normal sauces?
I would have absolutely died if Dr Arroyo came out with the stethoscope and told Sean he had about 4yrs to live
the GOAT XD
That has to be up there with the best guest, both really greats hosts coming together ❤
Best episode ever gj
what a season finale 👏👏👏
I feel Conan O’Brien is what Conor Wood will be in 40 years
wow truly one of the best episodes, Conan you filthy animal you did it
I didn't doubt for a single second that Conan would produce a Hot Ones episode of this caliber
Holy merde! Conan's a madman. My respect has increased exponentially.
The hot sauce buffalo
Legitimately probably the best episode of hot ones ever. For all of time.
Undoubtedly the best episode of this show! Talk about raising the bar
“i like to announce my mistakes up front”😂
22:27 You can see him holding back the pain 😭
It's not just the best episode, its the best episode by far
The classic “ I yam what I am” killed me
Always disappointing and disgusting to see who talks with food in their mouth.
WHAT A FKING LEGEND CONAN IS.
one of the best ever
Conan is not a human:)
The only video, in a long while, that i re-watch it immediately after it end.  This isnt just a show. This is a master at work. This is like watching Leonardo painting Mona Lisa in real time. Stuff of legend immemorialize.  Sean are excited, tongue tied & mind blown all at once. Dr Arroyo one liner are incredibly funny, on top of an already insane show. Like a wagyu on top of another wagyu.  Conan giving lecture on reading while holding a hot sauce bottle, waving & pointing, are both hilarious & poignant, perfectly suited the Hot Ones show.   To have the show ended with Conan screaming to Sean "you are a mf great interviewer" is an perfect encapsulation of this episode & momentous point of pride for Sean.
I have literally literally literally neverrrrrr laughed harder than this episode
Maybe not the BEST moment, but so many others were already mentioned: when his doctor checks his pulse with a two-handed choke lol
Welp. This was it. The best episode of hot ones just dropped
That was intense 🤣
Legendary!
Well.. I don't think they can top that!!
Legendary status❤❤
One of the greatest episodes, Conan is a gem.
it was the best till NOW
I was NOT expecting that. That was incredible.
Take a bow Conan.
The 🐐
Conan is the man
Normally Sean is so good in following his guests in their vibe while they eat the wings, but Conan took it to heights where even Sean couldn't follow 😂. Wat a performance by Conan!
Best episode of this show
Now time for Conan’s colleagues like Aaron, Sona, Andy, Jordan, Bill Tull, Tony the camera guy
It only got funnier as time went on
I think in the span of the last few years most people realized that humans like this one are in fact snakes who often belong behind permanent bars. A pity, I used to like Hot Ones, unsubbing. Can't unlearn things I guess.
Hands down one of my favourite episodes. Conan’s a legend!!
When he put the first wing in his pocket it wasn't that funny. But the fact that he kept that bit going, and just did it so nonchalantly each time, made it funnier and funnier.
Great episode!
What a spectacular way to close out the season!
This is even more unhinged than Eric Andre or Bobby Lee.  Conan is hilarious 😂😂😂
Conan came and obliterated all we know that usually happens during these interviews.
i love that guy
Easily top 3 if not the best episode !
This is by far the funniest episode so far 🤣
Stop the Show. Season finally just ended this Show. Cant beat  this. 😂😂😂
Top 5 episode of all time!
conan, finally, looking so old...
GOAT for a reason ❤
Conan is the GOAT
Yes, best episode. That is a 3 day recovery…poppin’ Tums like M&Ms
The wings in the pocket 😂😂
“Dr. Arroyo…he’s not the best, but affordable.” Conan 2024
Magnificent.
god what a legend.. for keeps my guy..
Smokey Jay? Uh oh
Cried laughing at the 3 Stooges souunds😂😂😂
Thank you.  Now Conan and Gordon in one episode please.
That's it. It's over. No Hot Ones can top this.
This man right here at this age doesnt mind making a fool out of himself just to make ppl laugh and thats exactly why he is legendary !!
Conan is gonna need a "careful around your eyes" reminder every day for the next year and a half
Best episode ever. Amen.
Conan doesn't feel the spice because he is probably a daemon. Remember, gingers doesn't have a soul xd
Best one yet 😂
22:53 haven't seen Sean with so much concern in his eyes :D
Living legend
BEST ONE EVER
Absolute magic.
is the doctor Trevor from the office ???
After the water buffalo story, he still licks Da Bomb!!!   That's what makes Conan a LEGEND!!!!
CONAAAAN! Never stopped being team Coco, what a heart-warming surprise. When was he in the arctic circle in Finland? I just remember the reeeeal good old days when he basically campaigned for his doppleganger to be our president :D
Sounds like Conans new show is a different version of An Idiot Abroad with Karl Pilkington. And I'm ready for that!
Conan O'Brien needs some milk.
This guy did it to the max? This guy..... He must be hilarious at the illuminati parties.... Smileyfaceemoticon
Conan hijacked the show and we're better for it.
I'm actually gagging.
Conan  turned into an irish Joker
Real talk though: drop the name of that suede jacket.
I'm just saying - Niall Horan's ep has 2.2M views, over a year. Conan the king's Hot Ones ep garnered the same amount in under 24 hours.
Pure chaos 😂
In contrast to most comments i actually did not like this episode. Conan tries really hard to be funny, even forces it, which makes it rather very sad. The questions are not that deep as we are used to as well. Lets hope for the next one
I can’t stop laughing. Thank you.
This is the best one ever . Absolutely crying laughing. 😂😂😂insane
When he put the wing in his pocket ☠️ 😂
GOD BLESS CONAN ❤
Dennis Leary next PLEASE!!!
Absolutely brilliant 😂😂😂😂
First time commenter here. This is the funniest episode I've ever watched. Incredible xD
The only thing this episode is missing is Sean saying "this isn't going well" at some point
The Best One Ever! Hands Down!
Parts of it were to cringey for my tastes, but Conan did actually make me laugh out loud multiple times. Great show overall.
The doctor thing is bizarre and this whole interview is unhinged in a not so funny way.
Did that just actually happen?  Would hate to be the next person on the show.  How!  Just, how!
I will always love that man 😂❤😂
This is peak Hot ones episode. How do you go from here?
This was hilarious 😂
Look at Seans smile through the whole episode - from start to finish :D
Singlehandedly the best episode
Bets are on: When does it hit 100mil?
wow he actually backed up the talk this was unreal 😂😂😂 pure example of mind over matter😭 great finale 🔥🔥🔥
This is BY FAAAAAR the best episode I've ever seen. I've seen far from all, still though. This just blew all the other episodes out of the park.    Conan truly is the GOAT.
'Charlie Rose with Hotwings'
Graham Norton, as a great host and British would be another amazing interview, for sure!
This episode deserves the instant view count
THIS IS THE BEST SEASON FINALE ever
This isn't an exaggeration when i say this is by far the best thing iv'e watched on any platform ever. EVER!
When Conan's eyes go bloodshot on that last one, you know he's feeling the heat 😂
It even a minute in and Conan brings up he’s Irish again
GOAT!!!!!!!
Dude did preparation for this. He had bits in the barrel ready to fire from the hip.
oddly, this is one of conan's finest moments. i dont know why but it is altogether fitting.  love you conebone69.
Argue with a wall, this is the greatest episode of hot ones ever 😂
This was amazing
The man, The myth, The Legend! Conan will forever be my personal king of Late Night!
Best episodes ever.
Oh yeah, this is the level of crazy I need to up my mood after finding out my partner was on a dating app :)
Hmm people in the comments saying Conan is the GOAT. Really?  One of my least favorite episodes, he was trying to hard, trying to draw attention, i don't know.. Why though,..people already know him .. A bit gross for me...
I’m actually crying 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is one for the Hot Ones hall of fame here
This proves red heads have a higher pain tolerance! Wow! Love Conan.
That's legendary.
Easily the best episode they've ever done
Masterclass in funny! Will always appreciate Conan
Conan is pure chaos and I love it.
Sean will never forget this episode and this will be the greatest episode on this show. Ever.
He made one helluva finale😅😅
this has to be the best episode of this show ever released!
Best episode since Brett Baker?
Oh my god, this made me so happy. My love for Conan just went up 100x
That was a fantastic episode!
Most incredible hot ones episode yet. Dave grohl was my fav before this one. All hail Conan!
The goat
saw conan talking about doing the show at the paley center, then saw this.  it's beautiful
best episode ever!!!! Conan is incredible
Man!! what did I just watch !! hahahaha
Conan is comedy god and apparently Spice god 😂😂
This is the single best episode of this show ever
Lifetime subscriber to Team Coco ❤
“I’ll quote my hero, Popeye” 😅 wasn’t expecting that to be his hero.
Conan is a freaking legend!
I lost it when he put the first wing into his pocket
Putting wings in your pocket is a total power play
My new favorite episode! 😂
pale irish man destroyed the challenge lol
Conan is back baby!
CLC tigers represent
Conan 👏 The End 😊
This is hands down the best episode of hot ones ive ever experienced. Good on ya conan, im definitely going to check out your podcast. 🎉
Conan is such a legend. Best Hot Ones episode, bar none.
Finland mentioned!! To the market square!!
This is gonna be a tough one to bet, my fav episode yet
Conan i love you ❤
I love Conan! ❤❤❤
Conan just straight up broke the show - love it! :D
Could be the greatest hot ones ever. Conan is a legend
I love it!
Also have a shot of sweet milk or almond milk drink before going to bed or while being on bed, the milk knocks you out to relax. Also put your phone on night mode . Both of these help. And if you really can't sleep, listen to delta waves.😊
The best, Conan is an OG. Reminds me of Chris Farleys intensity lol😂
That scene in Murderville probably killed all the nociceptors in his mouth.
I think Conan is proof that there is no “spice tolerance”, it’s just how comfortable you are with being uncomfortable.
please someone check on conan is he okay? x3
Need Donald Trump on here! hahahaha!  You just THOUGHT DJ Khaled was the biggest wimp.
Conan is the GOAT
Is this really the same show that also aired something like the spice ice episode? this is pure gold.
Please subscribe
Oh it’s my dad!!
Fricken wow
The secret antidote to Capsaicin that nobody knows about is Vegetable or Olive Oil. Its not technically an antidote but it gives the same result. Capsaicin is lipophilic and its attracted to oil, the oil will pull the Capsaicin out of your skin. Then wash the oil off with dish detergent liquid because its specifically designed to cut through oil. The effect is almost instantaneous.
I love how at 9:05 Conan says that in show business you have to make the audience think you’re getting the greatest show in the world and then goes on to be one of if not the craziest and most entertaining guest on Hot Ones. He was made for this life
THANK YOU CONAN for FINALLY revealing where that "wanaaa waneee" sound comes from! The Three Stooges! That's been nagging at me for theee decades!!
His monologue at the end of the episode with all the chicken and sauce on his face is making me lose it 😂
The Best Episode so far Conan is just...Perfect
Wowowowow incredible episode! Conan, is such a boss and comedy genus!
masterclass
18:54 no but that's some real advice though. Even if it's subconsciously, don't treat something you put so much of yourself into like a bit
Did Conan get the sauces prepped ???!   Well done, sir ! Stayed in character the whole time and really killed it
Conan talks about entertainment and then delivers exactly what he has been talking about. Such an awesome guy! Definitely the best talk show host - too bad Jordan couldn't join as well. Their interactions would have been great to watch!
Greatest. Hot Ones. Ever.
Next stop, POTUS.
The best guest ever. Wow.
LISAAN AL-GHAIB!!!!!
I would imagine Jim Carrey as a guest would bring a similar energy.😂
Oh my goodness I love Conan. Goated episode.
He's so unlikeable  This show is a lie...no way those sauces were legit ...no one does dad bomb without flinching   And he's just arrogant
🐐
Redheads don't experience pain like us
hahaha I love how he forshadows himself to annihilation
Late Night died when Conan retired. He was the last truly funny guy on TV.
I cant believe Conan exists... it just doesnt make sense
Conan needs to host SNL!!!
Conan is literally the best 😂
What a legend.
Finally!!! I'm looking forward to Conan a very long time!!!❤❤❤
They’ll never be another Conan.
Hahahahaha madness. But he should have brought his good friend jordan !
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Legends don’t wear… line?  Capes.  Legend. Conan. Rip his tongue.
please go back to a single table
This is why Conan will always be the best. He goes all the way and more, just to entertain you. Always a joy to see him. Conan should run for president.
My favorite interview yet! So funny!
He's no Ice Spice. That's for sure. Absolutely joyous.
He rode that high like a real champ! That is what the audience wants to see and he knew and delivered!
We need to see the aftermath of this! Hilarious
23:00 is one of the best meme templates I’ve seen in a while
1998
I haven't laughed this hard in so long
"Read widely and read well" - wiser words have never been spoken. And by someone spitting milk and hot sauce and wings. ALL HAIL THE SPICE LORD, CONAN O'BRIEN!
I love Conan dearly but the way he ate the wings just grossed me out..
Love love love Conan from the first time I ever saw him on TV. Time to resubscribe to Max I guess 😂
There needs to be something better than a thumbs up on here. That was EPIC. I wish Conan and his cleaner the best of luck tomorrow.                                                         BRAGGADOCIOS
Conan is one of my all time favorite people. Good memories in high school and college watching his show
When you ask Conan for a "firework display", you know he's gonna deliver
You, Chili Klaus and Conan should do something together :D
I'll keep saying this until I die: Conan is the funniest human being on Earth. He's willing to go to any lengths just to hear a chuckle in the corner. I know the guy hates compliments, but man, Godspeed, Conan!
Greatest episode ever.
Conan the goat man. His remote videos are some of the funniest things I’ve ever watched
Ok now Conan vs DJ Khaled
Clearly Conan used Homer's technique of coating his tongue in candle wax beforehand
You can tell the thought of necking Da Bomb crossed his mind 😂😂
Best guest so far 😂😂😂😂
He definitly got high of the pepper. haha Amazing
Conan is the man !!!!
Greatest. Episode. Ever.
THE BEST ONE 🔥
“Why can’t I feel?!”
“Hot ones is so different because when you’re in pain, it’s hard to hide your true self.” Conan “100% Irish” O’Brian: The same absolute madman he’s been his whole career
Love Conan ❤ This is a great episode.
I knew what happened about Warren G. Harding, but he told it in a way that made me laugh out loud 🤣
Best.  Hot Ones.  EVAR!!!
Conan is the GOAT of Hot Ones...definition of YOLO!
That last rant of Conan was great, so perfect
a Wing Drop.
Best promo I’ve seen, HBO better give Conan a second season for this
That.. Was.. Absolutely.. Insane..
someone please post this to Shaq
Aside from Steve-O putting hot sauce in his eye, this has to be the most extreme approach to the show ive ever seen... this was an absolute experience
He took a pay cut so his staff wouldnt get laid off.
"what's the point of being alive!!!"
Conan might actually be insane. Like actually literally insane. Legend.
Sean looks absolutely terrified! hahaha
The only night host worth watching
“Call the wife”😂😂😂😂
He absolutely killed it 😂
First I just want to say, "KEDAKAI!!! As god made her." As someone who really enjoys Conan needs a friend and is looking forward to the new Max series, this was a rediculous amount of fun. Had conan been anything other than a comedian he would have been hospitalized. He may still be at this rate. Loved the episode. Another instant classic.
BY FAR THE BEST EPISODE OF HOT ONES....... EVER!!!!! THE BEST!!!! No one compares, Conan is a Legend!
No ones gonna top this one, love Conan. Been following since Late Night era.
Finally the lord and saviour is on the hot ones
This is the best Hot ones episode ever! I was dying laughing the entire time 💀
Absolute best show ever! Conan takes it to a whole new level!!
Best episode ever.
10:01 Is this where the Ted Turner riding the buffalo skit originated from? If so that's awesome.
Lord mad lad
What a performer.
Conan the Barbarbarbarian. What a Legend.  He's totally f****** FINE
Legend
Man just call all his baby home 😂😂😂
This is just insanity!! 🤣🤣🤣
My prayers have been answered!!!!!!!!!!!!❤
He’s insane. Love him !!!
Legendary
Now I know why Conan no longer has a show.  He’s not funny.
Good luck to any other guest on this show in the future. It’s over. The king has been crowned 😂
Conan's the GOAT
too much.. so much, that turns to be ridiculous to force jokes
It's Brutus'z dead cat's name!
What a legend.....wow.
This is comic gold!! I love Conan!! Team Coco!!
Gold.
Tells Sean Evans that he loves him as an interviewer, and the proceeds to disrespect him and the show...and people love it. Guess I am getting old, because I just didn't get it.
I was hoping Conan brought Jordan Schlansky😂😂
What I like about this episode is that Sean is having a good time 😂
Best hot ones ever
I’ve just realized they do such great research that they what answer to expect.  The specific questions are meant to be a prompt.  That is incredible.
What an insane finale
Conan took to those hot sauces like he was a Fremen.  He let the spice flow.
Mistake!
I LOVED this episode. Conan is the best!
Conon 0'Brien you genius of a man. ❤🙌
Best episode of all time! Conan is inimitable.
Conan is the best 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
best episode ever after jeni lawrence😂😂🤣
never imagined someone bully to DA BOMB.  Conan just smothered it. He is the MAN THE MYTH THE LEGEND
GREATEST GUEST EVER!
That's it, the best episode of Hot Ones was officially released.
Is Conan still with us after this?!?!? 🫨
He understand the assignment and gave us a show.  he beats soooo many of the other interviews and Sean had a great time.
The Best! ❤❤❤
Unadulterated art.
After a couple of randoms lately this is a great way to close out the season. What an episode. Hang it in the rafters!
I’ve never loved a man more ❤
You can't stop me from being who I am. I am what I am, okay!
I hate this music
By far the most insane guest and by far the best episode!
Best episode of frist we feast ,from all seasons .Conan you are the true entertainer and the best tonight show host . You should teach these new jimmys . You are the GOAT . Waiting to se you on HBO MAX.❤
My absolute favourite. I always loved conan, but that cemented him even more in my liking.
This was amazing 😂
Best guest ever!!!!😂😂😂
I will always love the unbridled chaos that is Conan O'brien 😂 This was fantastic.
Pretty sure he did a few lines in the green room.
I clapped so hard
Trust me, the chili will burn more coming out than actually eating it
Conan is maybe my favorite person ever. I’ve been watching and now listening to him for more than 25 years, and he’s never said or done a single thing to let me down 🙏🏻
Conan might be the most naturally funny guy alive
What a legend. Ultimate display of commitment to the bit.
LEGEND.
Epic.
Best one yet for sho
Conan always 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dig this show...except the droning background music is annoying.
You can see how much of a legend this dude is just in the comparison of views.  2.2mil in 18 hours is more views just in one day than most the so called 'celebs' have had in the last few months
Conan  is the king. Nobody comes even close
Come to New Mexico and eat some real chili
If THIS doesn’t end up being the highest viewed Hot Ones vid, I’ll douse my iPad with Da Bomb and eat it. Thanks for finally getting Conan to do your show -the best episode ever!!! 🤩
2:10 I dont know why "i dont fear your wings man" is so funny
As soon as the doctor said "out of state" and Conan said "you should go", I got rid of the other tab I had open and was locked in. He came into this as a comedian and not the typical professional type business person, I was sold instantly. I love Conan as a comedian when he goes into it 100% and doesn't hold it back to be professional.
Fake
Best. Episode. Ever.
The guy that made Disturbed famous.
Ey man, Dr. Arroyo is a great doctor
That's the Conan we love ❤ Love you Coco.
smokey jay sounds like a stoner sauce
you could end the show here to an epic finale, this episode will never be topped
Dr. Arroyo: "Hi everybody!" everybody: "Hi Dr. Arroyo!"
GREATEST. EPISODE. EVER.
The best , just the best!!
he scares me...iiiii...i....ok i'm scared
Conan is doing for Sean what Letterman did for Conan.. taking him to a new audience.. Conan is no fool.. he’s incredible.
You have to admit that this episode ranks as one of, if not the best. Conan is a madman. Love that guy. 🤣
Absolutely Fu$%ing EPIC!! Conan, you never disappoint!
Best Guest ever
Wow George Costanza’s mom is looking great these days
Greatest....Episode....Ever!!!
this might actually be the best episode of all time. conan is the man.
This might be the GOAT episode. More funny people, less Hollywood actresses and rappers.
Conan has me wondering does he really put food in his pocket for a later snack
Despite everything, this might be Conan's finest moment.
I think this episode changed Sean's entire outlook on life and interviewing
Take a bow Conan. Best hot ones episode I’ve ever seen.
I think the hot sauce is just tomato sauce and actually dampens the spicy sauce on the wing
This one was epic
Easily one of the best episodes ever. Conan is just a natural. Pure raw unapologetic authentic. No one comes close
This is the first episode I've seen... And I even don't think it was supposed to go this way 😂 Conan is the GOAT. Such a great episode ! Sean really was a good host. The milk spittle sent me !!!!
This was arguably the best interview out of all . Conan :" You are a great MOTHERF....ING HOST!!!! " . " Dr Arroyo !!!! " . I officially have a total different kind of respect for him . "Dr Arroyo!!!!" .
This was a good 1
And that’s how ya f#€king do it.
I'm crying with laughter
Btw the last dab is only 60,000 scoville at best not 2.7 million lol
The grosser it got, the funnier it got. Definitely not always true in comedy, but in this case, it was.
this was just the worst
_“I miss Covid mandates.”_ FWF
Conan is insane. Been watching hot ones for a long time and hands down this is my favorite episode yet. Bringing the fake dr on is classic Conan. Loved it!!
Wow this was freaking legendary!
Funniest Hot Ones ever! Conan the G.O.A.T.! ❤
This was epic
The most unhinged episode ever! Loved it!
This was awesome
This episode deserved an emmy
I'm just gonna say it...Conan O'Brien is simply the Greatest of all time👑
Amazing!!!
23:43 I agree read the Classics.
simply the master of his work!what s great guy!
Conan is the best, Letterman is great also, Leno and Kimmel and all the rest just don't have any spark. Conan showed his resolve after the whole fiasco. I have fond memories of Conan, the angry rabbit sketch on Conan's show is still my favorite thing ever.
is his producer Jeff Ross playing the doctor?
LISAN AL-GAIB!! POWER OVER SPICE IS POWER OVER ALL
CONAN 😳😳😳 COULDN'T BELIEVE IT 👍🤗😊 Thank you 🤗🤗
HAHAHA I love Conan!!!
By yhr end his face was more red than his hair. His eyes are bloodshot 😂😂😂
The best FWF show till this date.i I am pretty sure that it will always on the top of my list. Conan should come bake in tonight show.iI Imiss his shows . But conan its not gonna be good when you will go to the loo.
Oh boy he's gonna regret this so much lol
CONAN! The actual king of latenight!
He's 100% Irish redhead, so am I. Spices have little to no affect.
Most I've ever laughed at a guest, that was insane 🤯
im so surprised how well he's taking the heat. how is he not covered in sweat?! he must be one of those people who rarely ever sweats.
Best, guest, ever!
The best episode ever 🔥
Epic
Conan is just peak physical comedy. This was a match made in heaven.
Having conan wrap up the season was just the cherry on top. Man, Conan brought such great energy to the table and had me laughing out loud a good amount of times. So happy to see that Sean and the crew were finally able to get Conan on Hot One's, you all must feel so proud. Congrats on wrapping up this season. I look forward towards tuning in to what's in store for the next season!
After seeing the pic on the story of the table looking like a mess. I would have NEVER guessed Conan and after seeing the episode I feel like I’m a fool for never thinking it would be him 😭😭
i never write youtube comments but after watching conan's performance , it got me so impressed to write one , what a legend .
EPIC
My Gawd, this is the best episode ever....
Often it´s the wings that scares people on this show, in this case the wings was terrified of Conan.
"CALL THE WIFE!"
NO SIMPSONS QUESTIONS?!! TRASH INTERVIEW!! ✌️🇺🇸
17:14 Can you feel it Mr Krabs?
Conan is the GOAT.
I wanna see Conan and Brendan Lee Mulligan in the same room…the commitment to the bit of those two men!!!
I see Conan, I click 🤗 Now who wants to see Conan do Hot Wings with Jordan Schlansky? 🙋🏻‍♀️
Conan was the best late night host of all.
Conan gives me creepy uncle twice removed vibes that your mom tells you to stay far away from. 😬🙈
That was fantastic. Best episode ever. Conan and Sean- just 2 GOATS
Jordan Schlansky's side kick hogging the limelight ridding on the man's coattails.
Best modern late night host and its not even close at all. Fallon, Kimmel are unfunny hacks
This man is comedy incarnated, a pure genuis. I wish he had brought Jordan Schlansky along and made him eat some of those wings. 😂 Thank you hot ones !
Conan at his best. 😂
I mean ..... has to be the best episode ever right Sean? what a finale .... brilliant
Best one ever.
When he's rubbing I lost it lol
What a master! 🎉
Cracked up when he asked if he could keep the wings and put it in his pocket 😂😂
Señor con esa cara quien quiere conprar su producto yo no ahora q lo veo😮 das miedo
That last answer was just pure gold. It might get lost in between all the comedy, but those that are truly listening can learn from it.
the GOAT
Best Hot Ones ever!!!!!!!!!
Now I'm gonna wait for Sean on the podcast.
please also get Jordan Schlansky on some time
And this, just proves how Conan is the Greatest Showman in the world.
Oh, heh heh, no, we're not going to Texas. They don't get to pretend like everything's fine. I wish them the best, but "...to the East, I go not."
He went for a second sip😂😂😂
I sincerely hope he can handle the pain to come after this.
jesus christ what a legend. the man is an unstoppable machine. bravo conan
I’ve watched many a hot ones. conan is the funnest guest by a mile!! even funnier the khaled lol 😂  “can I keep these??” LOL 🤣🤣🤣
Shut up Camera guy Bill. 26:26
I think the hot sauce invaded Conans brain! He may never be the same again.
The idiocy is off the charts and I love it. Sona will never hear the end of this.
Great episode
"Call the wife" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅  This was suuuuuuuuch a fun episode!
Towards the end Conan started to sound like master shake
Conan just demolished hot ones!!, the best episode ever in my opinion even better than Paul Rudd 😂
This is the absolute best episode since watching first we feast first show. Conan is the GOAT
We love Conan!
Not a fan of Conan, but this was a great show.
This episode deserves its own behind-the-scenes documentary.
My god that was incredible, that speech at the end had the feel of Charlie Chaplin's speech in The Great Dictator. Absolutely mindblowing showmanship.
Did I just watch a 27:20 bit on @teamcoco?
Hands down, the best Hot Ones episode ever.
Conan was definitely given a dangerous cocktail of chemicals by Dr Arroyo that he ingested in order to display that massive resistance to the chilies.
I started watching this lying down on my couch and by the very end I was walking around trying to breathe in between laughs. Absolute Legend
this was the best episode ever
He must have got his stomach pumped
This was amazing. Conan came and delivered. I had to keep rewinding this to catch parts I missed due to laughter.
Conan will always go down as one of the greatest entertainer of our era.
His coif is like it's own being
This is peak comedy 😂😂😂 Amazing!
Can someone please go check on Conan to make sure his stomach is okay 😂
Legendary!
BEST EP EVER
Conan O'Brien is a living legend! Best Hot Wings Episode ever! Sorry Gordon, this is now number 1
Conan the best
freaking mental!!
1000% loved this episode, sad that there were no Simpsons questions
That..... was a wild ride.
The best episode yet. Conan is an absolute legend. How Sean kept that together..
His orange stained lips are my favorite.
holly cow.... Conan and Da bomb is Crazy !!!!!   Greatest episode EVER !!! what finally.
Absolutely the best ever.
This was insane and awesome! Conan is the GOAT!
MATT PATT SHOULD BE ON THE SHOW. HIS RETIREMENT WAS HUGE ON YOUTUBE. GET MATT PATT ON!
Conan’s the best!
wow.... conan murdered this show. Just wow.
Hands down this is the GREATEST episode of this show ever! I haven't laughed this hard in a long time!!!  🤣😂
Greatest episode of Hot Ones ever.
He killed it.
I want to see the water buffalo footage so bad! Not to see him in pain. But just to see him jump on it
There is only one question left really.  Sean, what took you so long to bring in the g.o.a.t?
Conan started sounding like Master Shake towards the end there.  Best interview of Conan since his appearance on Space Ghost.
Conan proclaims Sean to be a great interviewer, then proceed to just take over the whole show and Sean can't get any of his questions out. XD Love it.
god the music is so appalling
best ever
That was wild. Easily my favourite episode of Hot Ones.
Conan: Le moot diya tere hot sauce pe
That. Was. Incredible.  I watched in awe 🤯🤯
Best one for me 😂😂😂
Why am I crying at this 🥲
Conan is a legend.
Interesting stories, Conan. No hot wing backup guest needed.
I’ve never clicked on a video so quickly in my life
Call the wife
2 celebrities that are always funny, interesting, intelligent and cater to their audience positively at all times? Nah, this isn’t for me.
Is Conan still alive? This was less than 24hrs ago
ANNIHILATED them wings!
"You're not a doctor, are you?" - "I should be."
This is pure comedy gold!!😂
Best hot ones ever😂😂😂😂
This is how I imagine billionaires eat every day
This has to be the funniest episode, man what a high! :D
Conan did not just do that with Da Bomb. 😂
Dear god I was waiting for Conan to wipe his eyes with those hands! Christ almighty he’s a different man that one 😂
My GOAT! Best Hot Ones guest of all time, easy
Conan is the final boss of talk show guests
The difference between 0:35 and 23:50
never seen sean talk so little
God I love this guy, what an absolute blast this episode was, I was laughing through pretty much all of it 😂 fantastic, this guy is a pure legend, always been hilarious to me!
The best hot ones episode!! Well done ! Conan is the goat 🐐 lol
you just gotta love this weird, funny and down-to-the-core professional guy. Conan was sweet too!
I seem to be the only person who didn't enjoy this. I might need to watch again and see what I missed!
THE ULTIMATE GOAT. IT IS OFFICIAL.
Oh gosh the refresh we never knew we needed! 🤣
Conan for President
This is one of the greatest Hot Ones ever.. bravo Conan, bravo!
best episode ever!
Best. Episode. Ever.
How would you not watch Conans new show, Conan O'brian Must go on Max April 18th????
I knew this was gonna be a good episode but i had no idea, this is...art, this is a dadaist performance piece, i loved every second, this will never be topped, now make him eat somethint crazy with chilli klaus
An absolutely legendary performance. Can’t imagine anyone topping this interview anytime soon.
this was superb episode! thank you!!
I’ve been waiting my whole life for this.
Conan is just monumental in this. I dont write comments often but this guy just compelled me
I love Conan.
Conan personifies commitment and dedication.  Bro is gonna need to bathe in milk for days after this but regardless.
Biggest and longest mic drop ever
Best hot ones ever. Conan is a legend!
After this episode, all future guests are going to come prepared with their own doctor.
Conan`s the goat
26:19 Ganondorf mains check-in with a like? Thanks.
hands down the best episode to date
There will never be another Conan Obrien, It's amazing we have thousands of hours of footage of him.
Dude, Conan is such a great guy.
My expectations were high but Conan blew right past them.
Ok... the "doctor" administered anesthesia directly into Conan's tongue, there is no other explenation.
Intense....
I love how he made more mess than Eric Andre.
I was gripping hard, that was an intense interview!! Amazing as always Conan
Best interview. Conan is the funniest person ever
The " im fine ! Im perfectly fine !!" part is the ultimate meme of this 21st century
Man Conan is such a  top tier comedian! He' an adventure and encyclopedia all in one.
Conan's eyes are so red and dilated at the end. Bless this maniac. 😂
Best episode ever!
One of the most entertaining episodes since a long while ...
This was the funniest Hot Ones in Hot Ones history.
Giga chad Conan the barbarian.
This was the best episode of Hot Ones ever. You can retire now. Conan shut it down. It was hilarious, it was disgusting, it was thrilling. 12/10!
I WISH WE COULD RATE YOUTUBE VIDEOS!!! THIS WOULD BE A MILLION STARS!!!! I haven't seen every hot wings episode but I know that this one is the best. the greatest showman on earth!!!!!!
This man is INSANE! I love Conan so much
Greatest ever... O Conon O Conon ringing the bells of heaven...
He turned into rick sanchez
Best episode until now 😁😂😂
Top Tier Episode.
I was cringing with second hand embarrassment and my OCD was acting up when Conan smeared Sauce all over his mouth... But I enjoyed every moment of the show.
From the small touch of pocketing the wings, to the steadfast tolerance of the sauces: this wasn't an interview, it was a masterclass on entertainment.
23:45 the hot sauce just pouring out all over the table 😅
Best. Hot Ones. Episode. Ever
Conan stole the show. He was the guest and host in the same time. Insane episode 😂  How can he drink Da Bomb???
Truly an American treasure. Give Conan his flowers while he’s still in his prime!!!
Legendary performance. Definitely shot his way up to the top 3 or not the number 1 spot wow 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
He’s definitely earned the title of Spice Lord
When I seen Conan was one Hot Ones, I was wondering if it would be chaotic or chill. Then he rubbed hot sauce on his nips. I can’t believe I ever doubted him 😂 Also Conan is probably saving all those left over wings in his pocket for Andy… Best episode to ever “drop” 😎
This is the best hots ones episode. Conan is the goat
the greatest episode ever. even better than gordon
This was almost perfect. Only thing making it better would to have Jordan occasionally coming in to comment on the pepper origin of the sauces.
crazyyyyyyyyyyyy
that is the jacket he wore in curb your enthusiasm
Legend. I am so fortunate to have worked with him, even if it was only for 1 day.
That's how you "steal" a show
WHAT A ROLLERCOASTER 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
Redefining Legendary.
Conan waste best I ever seen on this show.
This has to top all the episodes EVER!!!
Dude stuck to all the bits. What a legend
Conan never, ever disappoints, he is always on fire. Absolutely killed it.
Classic Conan, love it! 😆
fcking legend
I had high expectations... yet he still impressed me and became the official winner of the challenge
Conan is the greatest
"why can't I feel"  so true.
the baseball bat catch at the end was smooth af
Sean realising almost immediately he has completely lost control of the interview 😂
Folks We’ve all witnessed history right here. Take a moment to appreciate how lucky we are to witness it while we’re alive.
Never seen or heard Sean laugh/giggle for so long and so often throughout the entire show with any other guests!!
This is the best Hot One episodes ever made! Chaotic and unpredictable, the epitome of why we love Conan!
the amount of american is scary
Wow Conan really understood the assignment!!
11:58 sums up Conan’s performance here. Created something memorable for sure. 🙌🏽
Fun Fact: Red heads have a much higher tolerance to spice and pain than your average person
I just finished this episode and my jaw is on the floor. Conan is an absolute madman.
the best one hands down
Sooo as a gamer.... Can you try to get ASTECROSS as a guest or TIMTHETATMAN? OR DR DISRESPECT? bro
The best.
Cannot wait to ear  in Connan needs a friend the after math of this episode
Easily the best episode in Hot Ones history, I won't hear your counter arguments.
Conan f*cking RULES!!
Amazing work like always Sean but bravo to Conan for such a performance wow 👏🏼
I needed this!  😅
Where’s Jordan? He eats various spicy food.
He's the hero we need
There will be a before and after Conan in the Hot Ones. This was an intense experience from start to end. Gotta love this man. Also, Sean, you did great!
Conan is the next best thing to Robin Williams now, IMHO.
Sean looks terrified
one of the best show so far on hot ones Conan is a legend
This was the best Hot Ones episode, and I can't imagine anything else ever topping this.
Epic. Just epic! 😂
Quite simply the best episode ever of Hot Ones...  Most guests visibly had to force themselves through the pain barrier, but Conan barely had a watery eye let alone struggle to talk.  What a way to end the season.
There won't be another episode to top this.
Conan is the funniest! Never disappoints. National treasure!
Nobody even came close, this guy is something else, total.
Interviewing the interviewer, great job.
Sorry but I just don't get Conan's humor, he doesn't say clever or funny stuff, he's just bombastic.
Worthy of Robin Williams
Conan was badass! Loved this episode!
Conan The King of hot Ones!!!!!!!!!
Lol Nixon, no wonder they had so much Nixon on the Simpsons
doubel thums up!! It must be the hot wings. wheew....
Dude just kame hame ha  kaioken times *4 the spices into oblivion like vegeta
That was too powerful.  Legendary.
Is this Elons taller older brother???? On the real.... can't believe Conan took that sauce down like that! Cheers to CONAN! FIRST WE FEAST GOD!!!
muad dib!
LOVE the episode, Conan is awesome!!!
This is not Conan O'Brien. This is Conan The Barbarian
GREATEST OF ALL TIME.
Next Day - Breaking News : Conan is ded💀💀 🐐
He is the king 👑
New favorite
I had to pause this and just let myself laugh-cry for a solid 5 minutes when his doctor choked him, then said “it’s there” when asked for a pulse.   Conan is an elite comedian, while still being 100% respectful of the interview and interviewer, he can be absolutely batshit insane. Never a dull moment, this is my favourite episode by FAR!
GOATED
Have some more how sauce Conan, it will make your chicken extra sloppy
Conan had a variety of Korean dishes with Steven Yeun. No way he avoided spicy food.
Magnificent!
Conan O'Brien is a tough Mf
Truly one of the funniest interviews I’ve ever seen! I wasn’t prepared for it. I just wish sean would’ve shut up there at the end and let conan have his moment.
Nixon is alive
Greatest episode ever!! I'm so glad you managed to get Conan. Sean, you and Conan are an absolute gem together. I loved watching it.
I think we’ve cracked the code. You just have to YELL YOUR WAY through Da Bomb. 😂
What genius this red-headed fool is. 😂😂😂
Conan, Popeye, and Ghandi walk into a bar...
This is the single greatest piece of media I’ve ever experienced.
When are you going to extend an invite to Adam Cole and/or Britt Baker?  Would LOVE to see Adam Cole at the very least as he considers himself a spice lord / chili beast.
Game Recognized Game.
I honestly don't thin Conan can help himself, there must be some distant voice in the back of his mind saying "this is a terrible idea, stop" but it's overwhelmed by a monkey sat at the front of his brain screaming "DO IT"
Im convinced that Conan's taste buds are brunt off, like my gramma's, and he cant actually taste anything 😂
Incredible guest, Conan took it to another level. One of favorite episodes ever. Conan is such awesome spark of life
The best episode ever!!!! We need a behind the scene video😂😂😂
Conan O' Brien has never stopped giving everything he's got.  Absolutely amazing.  No one will ever top this episode.
Wow wow wow 😂 So insane...
Conan O'Brien is Jack Black on steroids with a touch of Will Ferrell...
This was superb, Conan is on another stratosphere. You gotta love him lol
amazing
Best ever
Unbelievable.  DaBomb is insane, a grain of rice dab hurts.  Conan is a legend.
Always loved Conan. Can’t wait for April 18th 😂
"You're not a doctor, are you?"     "I should be."
best one ive ever seen
THis was the greatest hot ones episode ever
Conan O'brien is pure chaotic neutral😆
Conan effen O'brien!
Conan would make an awesome joker for a new batman
Conan is awesome!
Most sensational guest of all time.
Ow my god, his face at the end hahahha EPIC
Been to Haiti recently Conan? >< Good show though, as always.
BEST EPISODE EVER
This is the most unhinged Conan I have ever seen. It's an amazing sight to behold.
Conan is seriously the best guest of all time
I never laughed so much watching Conan! amazing ep. 👏
Conan is the living embodiment of committing to the bit.
I don't think I have ever laughed so much at a First We Feast show....
Conan is the GLHOAT. Greatest late night host of all time. Also the GHOGOAT. Greatest Hot Ones Guest Of All Time. 111/10. That’s right. I rated this episode and performance ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN OUT OF TEN.
I feel like all episodes will be a disappointment after this.  Conan raised  the bar.
I love you Conan O'Brien
this was the best experience I had watching Hot Ones!
Broooo. Conan! 🤙🏻
Conan is certifiably insane for this. And we love him for it. I hope his tongue and mouth recovers quickly under the care of the -capable- affordable doctor that is Dr. Arroyo.
I started watching Conan when he took over the Letterman's Late Show, back in 1993.  he hasn't changed one bit in 30 years.  If anything, he's more energetic and outrageous than ever before.  I salute Conan who can keep up his comedy routine for so long and never miss a beat.
The man is a beast
Holy 💩🤣 Fantastic!!!🎉🎉🎉
Conan has been consistently funny for over 35 years.
This made my night
Wow.
Conan just created probably one of the craziest hot ones episode!
The goat! Team coco for life! Legend !
<3 Conan the goat <3
i died when dr arroyo just starts choking conan after being asked to measure his pulse 7:45
Top 10 no doubt
Epic
Did not disappoint!! Conan's the best!!! 😂❤
Conan math: Charlie Rose + hot wings = Sean Evans
First time seeing Sean lost for words and amazed like that, means Conan really did something crazy and fantastic while killing it with hilarity 😂🤣
Ive been waiting for this episode my whole life 😂
I have not laughed at anything in a while like I had to laugh at this.  Thank you Conan. Thank you @FirstWeFeast  Btw Conan is right: Sean you are a great host.
This is the hardest I've laughed in ages 😂😂
I think it's great that you guys have gone from interviewing almost nobody important recently- to now here you are with a real celebrity like your old days. Congrats!
One of the greatest comedy minds to ever live, this is a top tier episode
The Best Episode. Hands Down.
Conan. So good. The drool.
I love Conan, but at the beginning of the interview I afraid that was he was going for here was a tad gimmicky, but his commitment to the bit turned it around and made it hilarious. Lol, his travel segments were always amazing so looking forward to the show as well.
The Joker is to Conan O'Brien what Bruce Wayne is to Batman.
Greatest. Episode. Ever. Conan is like no one else ever.
Best episode Eva!
King of the show
Okay Conan just beat Jena Ortega and became the goat 🐐 of hot ones. I don't think anyone can top that. 💯
hilarious
Call the wife!
I think conan hates this show and only agreed so he could do everything he could think of to make it unappealing. Don't get me wrong I love conan. But, I think he sabotaged this interview.
*This is the seasons' finale, we need some fireworks.*  I'm pretty sure there'll be fireworks the day after...
Conan made this feel like the shortest half hour I’ve ever watched, there could’ve been an hours worth of wings and it’d have felt like fifteen minutes from how endlessly entertaining this was.
I dont know how Conan did it but pouring and straight drinking the hot sauces from the bottle is crazy since they already put it on the wings, love him so much
What a professional, what a genius. Hats off to cameraman 3.
I didn't realize until the end that Conan is 6'4" and Sean is 5'8"
This episode goes into the top 5 episodes of Hot Ones instantly
I never thought I would ever want to see Conan O'brien play the Joker until now.
I love that Steve Jobs  speech reverence by Sean ! That was so cool !!
best.👏
Let's be real: the greatest talk show host of all time is Sean Evans
Lauging out loud - wise this is the best episode ever! Unbelievable
Just do this. Watch the first 2 min and then skip to the last 2.
Conan O'Brien isn't funny
“We haven’t heard from Conan in a while…”
This is why Conan is world wide famous😂 people still watch replays of his shows as much as his new content  Conan eating spice like an Asian hahahaha embracing the spice as if it's the breath of life😂
Conan the king!
I want to see the update of Conan the next day or even the next few days 😂😂😂
Best episode
Now that's a guest for you
Amazing
Conan just gained a bunch of new fans.
Been waiting for Conan since the beginning and oh boy did he deliver. Easily the best episode.
“You’re not a doctor are you?”  Dr. Arroyo “I should be”  One of the best Conan bits ever and that’s saying a lot. Please keep bringing back Dr. Arroyo
conan is him
This is the best episode of hot ones I've ever seen and I've watched all them. This was amazing! 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
Best ever.
The spice doth flow! Barbarian's heart alight, By Celtic rites and blessings of the night.
G.O.A.T
I hurt myself laughing so hard, thank you everyone involved 🤣
The keeping the bones in the pocket was a power move💯
Everyone wants Conan to host The Oscars!!!
Conan telling you you’re an excellent interviewer has to be one of the most amazing compliments. I’d be a puddle on the floor
Conan is a legend
hands down the best episode ever
I'm not one for negative comments but I feel so compelled to just say, this was absolutely unbearable to watch. One of the most annoying guests I've ever seen.
Legend.
I mean...wow! Just wow!
first episode that actually had me laugh out loud
Conan is a Legend.
He went to Harvard
Finally you got him to come down! Greatest one by a mile. Thanks for this awesome moment :)
bring him back. best episode. ever.
IT'S CONES TIME TO SHINE BABY
Easily my favorite episode. Would love to hang out with Conan and some friends more than anyone
Simpson writer legend!
completely unhinged, love it!
Finally got him on this show amazing😤🔥
Conan turned rabid in the end 😂
No one understands comedy better than Conan. Everything he touches turns to gold.
Wing Drop :D
It's marvelous..
Idk I found this grotesque especially the end made my stomach turn. I do think he’s very wise.
One of the many talents that was actually pure on TV. For years this man made me laugh more than anyone could naturally
Instant hot ones hall of fame contender
Amazing 😮
Watching Conan slowly descends into madness. ICANT 😂😂
love conan obrien!!!
I need to hear Conan report back to us regarding his next day poops.
Conan is KING!!!
must have taken something before so he feels immune.
One of the most chaotic episodes ever and I LOVE IT!!!!
i really thought he had fake sauces setup until the last third there when he turned the colour of salmon
Is Conan on drugs?
Best episode yet - Conan wins Hot Ones 😅
Greatest episode ever.
I will honestly say this who anyone watches Hot Ones, don't get faze by the clout. Conon's episode is the best. he show what a true showmanship is and what you can bring on the table as a entertainer or performer. This is what a true entertaining video is !!! Good One Shaun and Conan, what a legendary episode !!!
Conan is class act. His persona still resembles the late night host I grew up watching.
THE ABSOLUTE GOAT
Content😂❤
No hyperbole: Conan just delivered a masterclass, not only at Hot Ones, but showmanship. Simply the greatest of all time.
I actually applauded at 19:15 when the doctor put the stethoscope on Sean's tongue.
Hands down best guest ever
Best episode ever
Not even any competition, this is the best episode ever.
Connan's GOAT status is locked in...
Hands Down Thee Best Episode!! 😂😂
I watched Conan live in Atlanta, when he hosted the show there, his guest was Charles Barkley, and let me tell you this guy is the ultimate professional. Absolutely killed it here, like he does everywhere. The dial is permanently stuck on 11, love you Conan!
I haven’t even started watching and I know this is about to be one of the best ones yet
RIP
*The Best to ever do it. Conan O'Brien*
I've never clicked on an episode of this show so fast.
The best episode ever
I’ve never seen someone so out of body, it’s like he wasn’t experiencing the hot sauce at all!
conan always reminds us why hes the greatest to ever do it
Glorious episode!!!
Conan 🐐
That was the best episode of Hot Ones ever. That man is timeless.
This was trascendental
Bro finna die
When he dies people will come to this video and wonder why he put those chicken wings in his pocket and only we know
Conan is amazing. one of a kind.
The music is weird and disturbing.
Fantastic brilliant episode
This is the best episode ever. Conan delivers 😁
That was a historic piece of comedy. Just amazing. Happy to have lived through the Conan Era.
Phenomenal.
OG
"It's on MAX. It used to be HBO but people found that to be too popular!" Has got to be one of the greatest off the cuff roast jokes ever. 😂
big fan of Conan and still to this day love his podcast I was missing Conan without borders and to see that his doing one on HBOMax I would sub to max just to watch him there. From my youth till this day man Conan O'Brien never disappoints.
That man will spend eight hours in the toilet and still feel nothing.
Conan is one True King
Greatest guest on Hot Ones is Conan Obrien! what a freaking legend! and comedy genius!
Conan makes DJ Kahled look like a school girl.
Conan O'Barbarian
This was it. There will be no better video on YouTube.
WORTH THE WAIT
Next Wednesday I turn 40 years old. In the 90s when I was in middle school I would sneak a small, black and white portable TV into my room to watch Conan while my parents thought I was asleep.   Today I found out Conan's birthday is the day after mine. 🤯
The only complaint: I love showing conan to my kids but he swears in this one. I always admired his ability to be the funniest comic without the swearing so many other comedians think is necessary.
Max? The Drummer?
conan just doesn't want the staff to sell his unfinished wings😂
I love Conan, he's the nicest talk show host ever. ❤
This was sensational.
Conan the conquerer! Conan, you never cease to amaze! Your true talent lies in your undeniable passion and love for what you do. Sean, you picked a winner!
Is he a mutant?
Favourite episode 😂
work of art
he brought a sidekick!
conan without borders was an amazing show, pretty sure this one be as hilarious. always lovely to witness you coco.
Probably the fiercest one ever. Same tolerance as Blaine but with emotions... weird fake emotions but emotions
I hope his redhead genes that helps with pain tolerance is active because he's gonna have a real hard time the next day with all that sauce all over him. Great content. He's super committed but I'm also a bit concerned about his health.
"He's the best at what he does, but what he does... Is actually very nice."
this was…. weirdly moving
I’ve had my nose run ever so slightly just smelling hot sauce vapors… how are Conan’s nips not on fire  Enjoy the backend of this experience Conan… your backend sure won’t though
This is .. one of the best hot ones that has ever been done. Absolutely brilliant!
Conan immediately making me laugh with the first thing he says... He's the best.
I always knew these sauce were not actually that hot to play it safe.... conan has a mouth of steal its the years smart mouthing.
He did it without thought but I bet later when he had to go to the toilet he regretted it.
This have to be the top episode
4 years tops😂😂😂😂💀
Glad him and and the buffalo made amends. Conan is on fire.
Bourdain is laughing at Conan in the grave
Goat 🙌🏽
Wing drop🐔🤣
This was absolutely amazing!
The audible “LET’S GO” I gave when I saw this on my feed😂
I don’t think Sean has ever been so thankful for a compliment by a guest before! But that’s why Conan is the best! He’s greatness who celebrates greatness when he sees it and you can tell he really sees it in Sean!
ahhhahhh🤣🤣 funniest episode ever Conan is bananas🤣🤣
GOAT
Two of the best interviewers of all time😂❤😂❤
Conan has done nothing to change my belief system, only confirmed to me that Irish people are just Caucasian Mexicans. <3
Conan is such a legend and by far one of the best Late Night Hosts of all time. So cool to see him take on the wings of death, and triumph in radical fashion,
This was disgusting…
Jesus!
That made me feel sick as much as it made me laugh.
MAD LAD!
Legend.
Conan is happy and i think we can all agree thats the best thing ever
Disgusting
The fact that (even when rubbing his upper cheeks) Sean never said "Careful around the eyes!" is solid proof that this is a bit.
He's the benchmark
I watched this after the Ice Spice episode.  Complete 180.
im very sick right now and i would looooooove to eat something with as much flavor as chicken wings im HUNGRY
I just purchased a Groupon for a medical exam with Dr. Arroyo. We'll see which expires first: the Groupon or me.
Best episode ❤
I think that's my affordable doctor in retrospec I think I should be concerned
Conan’s chaotic in the best way . What an entertainer. I was lucky enough to go to one of his shows back in the day  ,absolute legend
This is comedy in its finest form what a gift
conan is legendary xD
The way he handled Da bomb! Legend. ⭐️
I really lost it when he started making Three Stooges noises.
At the beginning I was worried he wouldn't be able to handle it. By the end I was worried he was going to have that "doctor" hit him with pepper spray!
Conan the barbarian ...get em
The look of genuine terror on Sean's face 22:37 at Conan's unhinged behaviour hahaha
This was spectacular and worrisome 😂
Dare I say it, this is Conans ultimate highbrow moment! A performance for the ages! A true professional! My favourite moment was all of them!
"I grew up in an Irish house..." Say no more, my friend. I know your pain.
This is what we call - “YouTube History”
Boston boy cheeks and lips red but not complaining about the fire
Greatest episode of all time
Legitimately the only one i laughed at. And i been watching awhile
Best guest ever!     Well done!
Best episode ever!🥵
He is so awesome! I would love to have seen him in some movies! I think that he could do just about any role.... once you forget that it is Conan O'Brien
Thank You Conan
hot ones officially failed.
I wonder if the aftermath of this was worst than the water buffalo? Probably wished for day old lobster by the nights end.
My good man Conan forgot the real challenge isn’t eating the hot wings but what comes after it.
Im conflicted about this. A lot. I conclude that insanity can in fact be beautiful.
Can someone explain the "out-of-state school" joke?
Bravo, Conan !
LOL, Conan tucking them wings in his pocket like the hip-hop cops are waiting for him to slip up... or down. No DNA/No Evidence!
Conan always delivers.   This is going to be hard to ever beat.
If you have never watched any Conan, PLEASE DO! HE’S INCREDIBLE!!!!
CONAN IS THE GOAT. THE GOAT! 🐐
Conan O'Brien, the 100% Irish man... the purest White of Whites, single-handedly destroyed the stereotype that white people can't handle spices 🤣
Incredible.  New respect for Conan.  Did he go for a stomach pump afterwards?   Complete disregard for one’s health is funny and sad at the same time.
The living redhead legend. We have to preserve him at all cost )
I'm not sure if I always appreciate Conan's humor. But this episode shows his absolute commitment to his craft and he always tries to elevate it to a next level. Heads down to him!!!!
"I said it and ghandi said it" - Conan O'Brian 😂😂
The true way to eat hot wings! In Conan We Trust!
I forgot how much I loved Conan ❤
Near the end of the show, my eyes were tearing ...but not from hot sauce , it from laughing so hard !! 😂
I've never laughed so hard watching hot ones
it's insane to hear Conan drop F-Bombs after being on tv for 30 years LOL
Seeing Conan feel what it's like to be truly alive after chuggin' fkn hot sauce is the best thing ever. Man's still got it!
omgomgomg it happened!!!!
Bring back preparation H guy and the self pleasuring bear! That's the Conan  I grew up with! That and his writing on the SImpsons of course.
Conan slowly morphing into Robert Patrick as the video progresses.
Coco killing it !!!! I could listen to him talk about paint drying or grass growing all day ....just funny genius!
The last hot ones episode I watched was ice spice. STARK contrast to say the least
Is that a jean jacket suit?
Best moment on the chanel!!! He was insanely funny!!!
Wow 👏🏼
By the end, Conan looked like a slightly hungry version of Joker. 😂
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
have been watching this show for so long but THIS WAS NEW!! BIG respect for Mr. Conan!! Always keeps you hooked
Wildest and funniest episode of all time.. Conan is the greatest.
The way he went for da bomb like that is just foolish.
And that's Why He's THE GOAT!!
wow that was a rapid descent
The King!
Props to Conan for pulling a Coolio. My new hero
HE DID IT THE ABSOLUTE MADLAD
😂🤣👍
BEST HOT ONES EVER!
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I thought Conan would be soft but this was absolutely incredible
Completely unhinged and yet he still managed to answer every question in a coherent and interesting way 😂
This is by far THE best episode i've ever seen <3 <3 <3
Conan your an absolute WEAPON 🥵
I’m 43 and I know that when I’m 70 I’ll still hold Conan near and dear to my heart as one of the best if not the best. What a guy. ❤
I'm a simple man. I see Conan O'Brien, I click thumbs up.
Dear gawd what great show!!!!!!  Can't believe the 'Da Bomb' bit!!!!! Oh gawd he is continuing!!!!!!
This is the best episode ever
YES! YES! GOSH DANG YES!
This show needs napkins
Could every guest next season just be Conan?
Lisan Al-Gaib! The Spice flows in him!
Conan the GOAT chugs hot sauce, does a great interview and takes over the show moreorless 😂
The goat.
conan: you can't predict the future. conan: predicted bea arthurs expiry date.
Just going to say it - best episode of Hot ones ever :D
Thanks for a great episode, but the background music kept making me think a phone was going off in another room of my house. It's very distracting.
Legendary episode...hard one to follow
i loveee this show and I watched almost every episode but this is probably the first time that I laughed so hard it made me instantly fall inlove with Conan hahahahahahahah
Conan overacting....again.....imagine it ! I found it annoying and disgusting tbh.
conan is the GOAT
legend
This guy is living life.
WHAT A MADLAD I LOVE IT
16:57 From Conan O'Brien to Bill O'Reilly
And that, my fellow watchers, is why Conan is unquestionably the greatest showman in the modern era.  Perfection 🤌
welp, I'm gonna remember this 27 minutes for the rest of my life that's for sure
I am shocked and impressed.  Conan is the man.
Sean has never laughed harder.
Well there is only one interview to top this. Get nardwar in here.
The 1st time ever watching this show is one of the best w/ my idol the Coco!
Best episode ever! I laughed so hard
Hands down, the greatest ever
Yes!
Insane! One of my favorite episodes.
Had me crying for like half the episode 😂
I'M IN PAIN FROM LAUGHING SO HARD, THERE ARE TEARS RUNNING DOWN MY FACE! One of the best episodes ever, right up there with the Eric Andre one.
Savage. Best in the biz.
Top 3 interview
conan o'brien was the last talk show host I have watched. Kimmel and Fallon are trash
Well there can't be any debate about the best guest ever now
God I love this man, may he live forever. probably 4 years tops tho
Best hot ones episode I've ever seen
Conan is the highest calibre of guest Hot Ones has had on yet, and they've had some huge celebrities.
...BREAKING NEWS.... "Conan O'Brien keeps his wings so his DNA can't be captured because he is an alien!!!"   😊😂😂😂
Freakin legend!!!
16:30 onwards is peak hot ones. Best episode by far.
What a legend. Best episode imo. Love Conan.
something tells me conan is going to have a very bad time in the bathroom. i would say i hope he records his sounds but i dont think any platform will be able to air it.
Love Conan praising Shawn's interviewing skills. He deserves every word of it.
This format needs one more thing. A tweet from the guest 8 hours later.
When he poured Da Bomb sauce over his wing, I said "oh no" out loud.  His face went bright red but he handled it really well. It was hilarious.
What a legend, jesus christ, best episode ever!
I just gotta say as a kid finding Conan's late night show back in the day was one the best finds for a kid like me that liked  the weird comedy his show produced and I've followed conan threw the years even saw a tonight show taping in LA and Conan has always been the best and having said all that I finish by saying this episode had me rolling laughing just as much as he did threw the years Conan is simply the best😂🔥👏
I knew Conan was unhinged but this is amazing!
That was phenomenal
Conan has kept his original first car, a 1992 Ford Taurus, even when he finally hosted his dream show, The Tonight Show. The doctor guy is actually a writer and has worked with Conan since the early 90s. Nobody can tell me this guy isn't the best comedian working in entertainment today. Just an epic man. We are not worthy!!!!
He overdid it. Not funny.
This may be the most positive thing I have ever seen in my life.
MASTER SHAKE!!!!!
Ok, who else saw the answer to the "how are you with hot foods" question and thought "oh he'll you are so f__ked!"?
What an odd guy... he should get his own show.
Poor Guy
Best one yet
Conan made me smile again! Ninety percent of the time on this show, people are crying about the hot sauce, asking about its name and where it comes from. But this episode? You guys just had fun! Respect!
Conan needs his own hotsauce 🔥
this is the best hot ones episode hands down. nothing else even comes close can't believe how well he handled the hot sauces.  he should be called conan the barbarian for real
BEST ONE EVER! He is sooo f ing  funny 😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
really needed this after that unseasoned Ice Spice interview
this video has made me subscribe to the channel and mark Conan's show release date on my calendar, simply incredible
He who controls the spice, controls the universe
Conan has always been class, legendary hot ones. well done!
After they stopped filming, Conan was hosed down with milk while he screamed.  But that’s because  he does that after every show.
I never watch without skipping for atleast few seconds, but this time I watched every moment of it. Great!!
milk mouth is burned in my skull
I’ll watch every episode of Conan’s new show it’s what he deserves after this
What a roller coaster of emotions, from worrying about his well-being to crying in tears from laughter 🤣. Fantastic episode!!!
That was the hardest I’ve laughed while being so inspired by someone’s full-of-life attitude in my whole life.
Dudes gonna sell those wings on ebay
Living legend. He has a great team and a great eye for talent because he worked on SNL.
How do you even make the show after this? PEAK!
that was incredible !!
Now that's a professional.
"MY INTESTINES HAVE TURNED INTO ACID AND I CAN STILL REMEMBER THE PLUG" bro
'There's comedy in the old testament'
This was hysterically historic
That was absolutely amazing. Unparalleled
What a beast!!!
i couldn't stop laughing!!!
I’m so happy to see this colab!!!😂❤❤❤🎉😊
This is the most unhinged I have ever seen someone on this show and its not even CLOSE.  God bless that giant Irishman.
That was the wildest episode yet. How was that humanly even possible?
Okay fine I’ll rewatch every single remote Conan section that’s on YouTube for the fifth time
22:25 — Conan doing his own stunts. Good Lord.
Woah
This one didn’t drag at all, to the point and hilariously burning. When you don’t feel time go by you know we all had a Good time.
Conan is the GOAT he was absolutely the most hilarious guest and handled the wing the best
He was doing the most😂😂
THE G.O.A.T.
Great! I watched this in the office to have some brown noise while doing some boring tasks, I now might get a write-up because I started laughing so hard!
Best episode ever
Conan is the man. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
And Julio Torres says *he's* "simply too much".  Julio is simply so. Conan is sloppily so. 🤣 Keep away from my suede! 😆
Wow... that was totally insane!   Craziest Hot Ones 🔥 episode I've seen yet!   Conan totally outdid himself! Having "his doctor" there as a comedy prop made his appearance even more over the top in addition to literally pouring hot sauce down his throat only to be vomiting up saliva while he yells towards the end of the show! 😂
clearly this is the last ever episode because it is the greatest and the ultimate one! Comedy Gods have mercy! i died dead
Conan is now the hot ones goat.
"There's funny everywhere." - Conan O'Brien  ABSOLUTELY EPIC
Conan has been one of if not the funniest person in show business for decades now, And people need to appreciate this hilarious genius more often.
Best Hot Ones ever.
the best since gordon
this by far has been the best episode yet
The doctor hahahaha
You need to show this to MGK and call him back AGAIN! 😅
great episode :)
Jeez. What a wild ride. Conan is the king.
This is the funniest episode I've ever seen. I love Conan
Saved the best for last~! What a FINALE. I hope he's ok. ... LOL!!! We must protect CoCO.
The living legend
I’m not buying it
I don't think I've laughed so hard in a hot ones interview!
Bro is RED
I HAVE NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY LIFE I LOVE CONAN ALWAYS HAVE. BEST EPISODE EVER BEATS
i cant believe you finally got conan
GOAT of late night becomes GOAT of Hot Ones
Best episode ever!!!
Sean, how many mentors would come on your show and give you 120%?  That's why Conan is my all time fav.  Good show bro, hope you made a life long friend :)
Sean to every guest: Careful with the face.  Conan: Various degrees of the spiciest hot sauces smeared all around his face
This show alone made up for the season’s lackluster guests
Hot Ones, needs to gather all the mvps, and have them do a super spice challenge. Or like nvite them again, but to try spicier sauces.
You could teach an entire course on comedy from this video alone. Good god.
I’ve skimmed through a few episodes of “Hot Ones” but I’ve never actually watched an entire episode until now. I’m a huge Conan fan. He has a quick and agile mind and shows no arrogance when he utilizes it.  He has no vanity and doesn’t mind looking and acting absolutely ridiculous. This was highly entertaining. If this episode is an example of the quality of this show, then you’ve just earned yourselves a new subscriber. Now, if we can just get David Letterman on the show, I’d be the happiest girl in the world! This was a great episode.
Great interview of Conan. That guy is a comedic legend. Truly a great show Sean.
The best episode. No contest
Favorite episode
I like the over the top energy, never expected him to be sooo over the top, but it sometimes comes across as rude and his new show also seems obnoxious, (didn't like the doctor gimmick) not my style of entertainment when you take the respect away from everything and everyone around you, I understand its a act but i prefer more transparency to prevent being rude, if  there was a couple of moments where he got sincere which I appreciated.
The Best.
Now this is a hot ones I'll watch most the guests are lame af but my local store started to carry your sauces the verde one is Meh  I want the one is spot 3
That Dr thing better be a skit fr.
I'm pretty sure Conan would never have anything rigged (like taking one of those taste modifying bean pods or anything) its just him in his natural environment with a completely natural hairstyle with about 4 years to live *TOPS* ........ 🎉🎉🎉🎉⚰
Greatest Hot Ones episode. Conan brought the heat. Pun intended.
😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅 Conan my man!!!
Sean looks terrified of conan towards the end. 😂
This was the most insane episode ever. I’ve NEVER seen someone House “DaBomb” arguably the worst of the bunch, like it was tapatio.  I honestly think Conan had to visit the hospital after this.
I haven’t looked away in so long I was laughing and shock everything was so fast paced . It was brilliant . It’s so great to see his character outside of his own domain. And still be himself . The level of commitment is admirable . Amazing episode . Top 10 for sure . And this falls under top 5 all time .
This was insane .❤❤😂😂😂😂
I don't think I've ever had a true "jaw drop" moment whilst watching something until today, and this day brought two of them. First with Da Bomb, and next with The Last Dab. Conan is a legend.
For anyone readings the comments beforehand, don't eat your favourite snack or meal while watching this episode, it's hilarious but revolting it's Conan.
never laughed this hard .. this season was crazy stacked
That is without doubt the funniest episode I’ve watched 😂
conan is the guy with zero hater
i was smiling the whole way through, conan is a comedic genius
conan is a savage pouring the bomb like that shiiiiat
It might be first time someone brought doctor with him, conan sense of humour is next level😊
this is the best hot ones 🤣😂
What an awesome show! Finally, someone went hog wild on the sauces!! And one might have guessed it'd be Conan O'Brien! Such a treat. Been waiting for Conan's new show since right before that writer's strike.
I just opened YouTube I already know this is going to be my favorite episode. Conan is hilarious I miss his late night show.
Camera Guy Bill has secrets.
Daywalker
THAT WAS EPIC!!!
Conan is still obsessed with Nixon since his simpsons days
god bless the camera person for cutting to the table, with the bottles dribbling and rolling on their sides then panning to Conan 20:50 - 20:53 😂
Conan is a national treasure! Protect this man at all costs! GOAT
Conan sweating is making me sweat lol
The GOAT.
Conan was the best. I'm a big fan of this show. I probably have seen every episode. I don't think there's been a better guest than Conan. Super funny. 😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥
White whale of the show turns out to be conan
"CALL THE WIFE" got me rolling 😂
Groucho would be proud!
This man is the absolute GOAT. He is relevant to every generation, he just knows how to make people laugh, no matter your age. I'm so happy to see him be appreciated. Long live Conan.
GOAT
I don't believe this.
This video should be put on display in Louvre. This is just perfect
0:44 “I never saw a spice until I was 52 years old” Oh yea, this is gonna be a good one 🤭
This may be the GREATEST interview on this channel, EVER! Lol
I am amazed by Conans dedication to producing the show.
This is  quite  possibly the best Hot Ones EVER!!! Conan killed It!!
😂😂
This is why Conan will always be a Legend! Never missed a beat to send those zingers! Cant wait to see his new show on MAX! (rolls right off the tongue)
Yoooooo! 😂 Literally the absolute BEST season closer in Hot Ones history!!! Conan killed it!!! LFG BABY! 🔥🔥🙌🙌🙌
This is an instant like by 0.01 seconds. My favorite interviewer with one of my favorite comedians. Both of you guys are inspirational through your consummate skill at your individual chosen skill sets and humble characters.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is what showmanship is all about.
So here's the challenge for next season:  Joaquin Phoenix must match Conan or be merely the pretender Clown Prince of Crime
22:55 look at Sean's *eyes!*  😆😂🤣💗💖😄
How is Sean, pronounced SHAWN. If this is the case why not call the Sea 🌊 the SHAW.
Power over Spice, is Power over all - Conan O'Brien
I started watching Conan when he went to tbs in 2010. Conan and Andy made me laugh every single night. I’ve never watched anything Conan and not laugh. He’s by far my favorite comedian.
This is incredible
The best one in awhile! I laughed so hard!!! Even if it was a skit.
Is Conan ok?! Dude seriously chugged half and smeared hot sauce all over his face. I kept going between impressed, disturbed, and then thought he might have Covid where he couldn’t taste it as bad. Dude is all over the place, Sean had no clue how to react lol
This is easily the best episode ever. 1000 times over. He puked on himself for the sake of comedy.
I love Conan 😂
The maddening, boundless comedy of this myth is on a different level than the rest.
It’s no contest. Conan handed us the GOAT Hot Ones episodes.
He totally channeled Chris Farley there
BEST COMEDIAN OF ALL TIME!!
Cringe.
Conan is just amazing. My favorite ever episode. What a boss.
easily the best episode ever!!!
That had to be the most unhinged interview I've seen maybe ever. Those last few moments had me gasping for air that was insane
You can’t deny his insane desperate pleas contained the passion and pain of a thousand lifetimes, I will subscribe to HBO Max
Conan is an animal
if when eating hot and spicy foods and your mouth is on fire, drink some milk, all the fire will go away.
Wow, savage.
Well, that was a professional take on advertising his show. And affordable.
up there with best episodes of all time! Conan is a living legend haha
THE GOAT❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Pretty amazing
I hope Conan took the next few days off 😅
Did Conan do an 8 ball before filming this?
Best Hot Ones in years. Conan is a true master. I hope he is entombed in the Smithsonian one day.
*slow clap* *uproarious applause* *standing ovation* Well done, Conan. Well done.
Conan is a true consummate professional
No one is going to say how Conan refuses to waste food? Proceeds to put all his unfinished wings in his pocket for a later spicy snack.😂
What an absolute f*ckin legend!
Best Episode Ever!!!
Conan is a king and a professional one at that.
I'm not that surprised that the guest who may be the best person in history at making an interview interesting ended up making the best Hot Ones episode.  Well done.
Legend.
Here at 2,050,482 views.
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!!
My man started so strong and cocky.. haha.
YEEEEESSSSSSS
Best episode ever!!!!😂😂😂😂
This is the first time somebody came on this show and stole the show form start to the end. BEST!!
what a legend 😮😅🎉❤
25:17 HITS HARD
Conan moth joke
Conan is a legend! Ironically, I am trying to grow Carolina Reaper peppers this year, known as the hottest peppers in the world. I bet that last thing of hot sauce used those 😂😂😂
laughing so hard I am crying
Best episode of Hot Ones ever! :D
Just one word. (WOW)
The greatest episode ever.. this might go into a cult status..
this was fuvking insane mannnnn
Awesome! LOVED IT!
Ahahahahahahaha
I'm only commenting so that when this video gets minted and placed in the Smithsonian that I can say, "I was there!" I'll be telling my child about this day for the rest of my life.
I'm just imagining the people that are introduced to Conan O'Brien via this episode. Yes, this is pretty much what you see is what you get.
Always loved conan. Made me laugh so many times in my life.
Best to ever do it 😂
They need to have sona and Matt react to this on the pod !!!!!!
I've never watched one of these shows before, just snippets. LOVE CONAN❤
I Demand DJ KHALED Watches this.
21:06 and I'm *wheezing*  🤣
What a showman. BEST GUEST EVER!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’ve never been a big Conan fan but this might be the best episode to date
Only Conan can bring pandemonium to Hot Ones.
Who knew it would be this much fun to watch Conan developing an ulcer on camera
I miss Conan
I never thought I'd say this, but you might honestly be able to retire Da Bomb after this one.
what a Legend
This was absolutely wild! 😂
Legend!
Would not be surprised if this video eventually becomes the most viewed video on this channel.  Conan is a legend and his quick wit and commitment to the bit sets him apart from his peers.  The things he will endure just to get a laugh out of the audience   is practically limitless.
What a wonderful human being! Best episode, thanks! Now I know what I want to be when I grow up.
respect.
That's a man who doesn't do his own laundry lol
Oh my gawd. I’ve never EVER seen Sean so terrified for his guests life before. Conan is a spice BEAST!!!
100% best episode 😂😂😂
Before I see this video I'm going to say this is the best Hot Ones episode of all time. Because it has Conan O Brian.  After I watch this video this video will be the greatest videos of all videos in the land of all time forever and ever. 😂
this interview was everything ive ever longed for
His delirium mixed with comedy and inspiration at the end of the interview is one of my favorite pieces of entertainment ever.  Not just on this show.  Ever.  It’s like part of his brain stopped caring while another part doubled down on caring.  He gave it 100%.  I will think about this for a long time.   … But I bet he felt REALLY sick after this!
This is the most insane episode , Conan is a legend
Mark this as the very moment when Conan finally snapped. 😂
AAAWOOO!
Conan's the ONLY "Hollywood" type whose podcast sounds appealing. I'll always be loyal to Conan for all he brought into my life. Many a summer vacation night was spent watching him.
Conan is too funny 😂
Never seen Conan so insane
I did not expect anything less. This man is a PROFESSIONAL.
i actually gagged at the end
Conan was on GOD Mode.  Best. Episode. Ever.
Welp. Conan broke Hot Ones. Shows over now lol.
CONAN IS GOAT.
I was worried about Conan for not feeling anything until the last one kicked in juuuuust as it should be. God bless Conan, he is a national treasure, love to see him back.
Literally Googled "is conan o'brien dead" after watching this. My god, what a legend!
That was legendary!!
Really puts that Ice Spice episode into perspective.
Only Conan can do this. This was epic.
Conan the barbarian legend. Best guest ever. Wow.
Best episode ever
Conan summoning the spirit of Norm and destroying the concept of how the show was suppose to go and making it his own beautiful mess of genius
Conan is the goat, but he’d claim the animal before the acronym.
Conan is the absolute GOAT! If you don't like this episode, you should go stand on some train tracks and wait.
I can’t explain how much I love this man
Greatest ever episode of Hot Ones
Conan is a legend !!!  10/10
16:43 💣
Best guest on Hot ones Ever👏👏👏 AMAZING😂😂😂👏👏👏👏
Did anyone think it was going be this good?? It was set for good but this is brilliant
Conan is king 👑
wow.. the best episode
This is possibly the most mad hatter moment I have seen in the last many many years.
The best
king conan 👑
He came in and created the greatest show. Respect! He truly contributed to the brilliance of this show!
We fought forever for this.  Conan and Norm is perfect, they will always be connected
Im actually so worried about Conan’s health after the amount of hot sauce he consumed 😭
What did I just witness?
Dude I love Conan. Legend
We've got the scale now folks.  Everything can now be ranked from DJ Khaled all the way to Conan O'Brien.
Greatest episode to date.
Grate!1 This is entertaining. 🙌🙌
No ways Conan is that one friend your mom warns you not to play with for too long because yawl might get into something bad 😭😭☹🥵🥵😟😱😰😨
It seems like lots of people here are lacking the proper English language, I  know Sona is a cohost on Conan's podcast I'm just saying she doesn't work as his personal assistant anymore, fact!!
Just pure legends, these two. A moment of legend
That’s the best episode ever 😅
"The other guy..." 😆 I think I know who he's talking about.
18:28 the glisten on his face is so funny to me.. i knew i had to watch when i saw a clip of him downing the sauce, i was like... hes gonna regreeetttt thatttt!!! Lol i KNEW da bomb would get him
I haven’t laughed that hard in a long time. Thanks Conan.
They dont make them like Conan no more
This was such a great episode. Conan is awesome.
Conan is the goat!!!  Should have had Jordan schlanzki on as well.
U gotta have druski next season 😭
Lol got me cracking up good. Old school humour, the best
i love conan !!!!!  never click faster in my whole life
Pure chaos, and I love it! Conan is a comedy genius. This episode will be hard to beat.
this episode will be studied by future comedians as peak comedy gold.
Love how they've edited this. Sean was matching Conan on sauce quantities, but the camera always stayed on Conan. When your guest is crushing it, he gets the attention. Conan has one-upped Steve-O.
The best!!!!
KIIING CONAN
Haha, how around 17:25 the water turned to milk. 🤣🤣🤣
conan is goated
Conan, what a MAD LAD
Best episod ever!
This madman took the bottle of Da Bomb Beyond Insanity and added more to the wings. Somebody call an ambulance.
Conan ability to change tone even though his body is becoming a griddle frying Blended 200 Red thai chilis.   He deserves to get the greatest amount of budget for the greatest of expenses to make the greatest Episode of Show business, the bold in this guy is more bold than any font in Google docs, he is Ultra Supreme bold
What a fukn LEGEND 😂🙌🏽
You should have brought Jordan Schlansky too 😂
Best. Episode. Ever. 😂
no "MAX Weinberg" shout out??
The best Hot Ones episode, hands down!!!
That hair!
Conan is such a hack . . . pathetic.
well, that was a fucken' ride! thank you Sean and thank you Conan for the hurt face!
I have been watching this show since season 2 and this is by far one of the top 3 ever
best episode of all times!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🔥🔥Conan O'Brien your the Man!!!🔥🔥👏👏👏👏🧡❤‍🔥🙌what a way to end the season!!👊❤‍🔥
After years of hearing him saying we finally have an answer to the “wanee, wanaa”
15hours and 174K likes. That's Conan to you! ☺
Norm
WOW... I never really cared to bother with Conan before because I never watched but this was an amazing episode. I'd have to agree he basically rewrote the rules LOL
Best one. Ever.
Yep!  Just what I needed to stay awake on nightshift!  This MF. R.  Killed it!  I mean. Killed it!  Wow. I wasn’t there and yet I feel so alive!! 😂. Good show old chap!  Lol
I’ve been a fan of Conan for so long……. So f*ckng long. He’s by far my favorite comedian, my favorite show business PERSON. He has such an incredible heart. He’s so kind , considerate… I mean, the list just goes on.  Your parents must be so proud. Your kids , your family, your friends.  And then you come here and you absolutely destroy - it was EPIC!
Conan!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was amazing. Best Hot Ones ever?  A lot of that is because it was tremendously clever. The humor in Hot Ones is usually from people reacting to the spice. Conan took it the other direction. First, he set everything up for people to expect an amped up version of the usual Hot Ones formula. He brought up bland Irish food, brought his "doctor," etc. The expectation is that he's going to be flipping out over the spice level. But then he flipped it: the heat didn't get to him. And he committed to that and kept going, even when his face was getting flushed and he must have been on fire inside. And during it all, he's having an interesting conversation, with occasional breaks for zaniness later on.
This is why Conan is still the best. Went all in without even thinking. Sean was completely baffled and getting worried but went with it...  By far the Best episode. no question.
Conan is  so fearless here he went for it absolute Savage and he is the King he demolished it and put on a show he came out swinging.
This is the greatest interview of all time!!!!! I’ll love Conan forever
We got him - the best guest.  I just want him to say Norm
This is sooooo good!!!!
Best. Episode. Ever.
This is easily the best Hot Ones.
Conan is legend
This is how you take over this game
All timer!
we love you conan!!!
I cannot believe We are actually witnessing Conan becoming the joker on this show
Just for Conan, I’m going to subscribe to max
Duuuude he MURDERED them wings, RIP wings 🙏🏽
There are a some things Conan has done that I keep watching. 1. Dartmouth commencement, 2. Interview with Jim Gaffigan during covid, 3. Hot ones. Every line was funny. I don't fear your wings, man 😂
100% the best episode, ever.
This is THE BEST episode. Conan was a perfect guest and when he told Sean he was a really good interviewer, man. That coming from Conan is one of the greatest compliments you could ever have.
This is the best episode of hot ones evar! They should just retire the show right now I'm not waste anymore time.
This man is the Jackie Robinson of Hot Ones...defied stereotypes in the face of adversity, set new expectations for future players, left the announcer speechless, and changed the game forevermore.
coco complementing his interviewing skill maid me teary eyed
Conan just gave you a personal masterclass on showmanship.
I really channeling his inner Farley for this one
The best of the best. I knew Conan would have the funniest reactions when eating the hot wings. Legend 😂
You know you gotta do JEFF ACURI
okay, that's the first time I've laughed lout loud watching this show, when Conan starts shaking that sauce all over the place 13:41 -13:43 😆
DO JEFF ACURI
What's wrong with me, why can't I feel 😂😂😂 same Conan, same.
So happy for Sean to be able to interview conan
Was not expecting Conan to drop sage-like interpersonal and interview advice on a spicy wing show
❤ love it  haven't watched a talk show since his last on  NBC  always funny guy
No one will ever beat this appearance! Legendary!
Funniest talk show host ever! 🙏
Man! Conan Is Crazy Hilarious 😂
I’m crying 😂😂😂 team coco
he's hilarious... best episode in this season!
Conan is the GOAT
Conan is the best!!!
Conan is a God amongst men. Favorite hot ones episode
and people say Kanye is insane..
That was intense
Yesssss!!!! Conan is da bomb!
I haven’t seen an episode in years, this is one of the best episodes I’ve ever seen, I knew I couldn’t miss this one! What a legend!
This is way better than expected
Dude, Conan is the BEST. no other words to describe this episode. How could anybody follow this one in future episodes?? THEY CANT.   Hail to the King, baby!
He is too white for this, I fear he will just melt (even more than he already seemingly is :d )
I believe Conan is one of the best people that ever lived. I love this man so much. ❤️🔥⚡️
Wonderful! Finally the Greatest of all late night hosts! :D
"The Other Guy"
YESSSS!!!
Dude, man, Conan went off!  💥
Hands down, by far, favorite Hot One's episode
This man powered through on Irish Anger alone.
Insanity
wow this episode was fantastic !!! I was laughing so hard I was afraid I'd wake my neighbors.  TY CONAN!!! TY FWF!!
One of the best things I've ever seen
this was the best
CONANNNNNN!!!!!❤❤❤❤
new GOAT epi
Conan is awesome
This right here is an absolute masterpiece ❤
The best episode
Conan was the best! Hands down!
One of the greatest, one of the most insane, one of the greatest episodes of Hot Ones ever...ever. I don't care what you say but this is an insane wings drop episode, what a way to close the season, this is poetry. Thank You Conan Obrian, thank You Sean, thank You Hot Ones crew. Thank You YouTube. Beautiful.
Not a fan of physical comedy.
jesus christ!
I love Conan, He's the only talk show host i'll watch. As soon as I saw him on a thumb nail it was an instant click.
That was the best hot ones ever !
One of the funniest guys ever
Conaaaaan ! What a Boss!
Conan was literally the joker. Never have I laughed so hard during a hot one’s episode.
I didn’t think I could love Conan any more, but he just created my new favorite episode and go-to video whenever I need to die laughing.
Conan may be in comedy, but he came in ready to be a barbarian on those wings. He may have been shaken, but years of comedy acting has made him stronger than every other interviewee.
The absolute contrast between Sean and Conan at 26:07 is incredible
yes best episode ever.
WE WANT SCHLANSKY!!!
Has anybody checked on Conan since this episode airs? He does not look okay! 🤣
Conan is insane
Hands down one of the best episodes of Hot Ones ever, Conan is awesome. I will definitely check out the new travel show!
absolute animal
Been watching Hot Ones and Conan for most of my life and this is easily the best Hot Ones episode of all time. We’ll never have a better showman in our lifetime
This is the first one when I am actually worried about the guest but Conan doesn't seem to be from this world; thought he will be out on the 5th wing; mad props, he is a Legend.
2 mins in . Top 5 guests of all time . Fun fact he actually went to Harvard 😂😂
Conan was epic 😂
Not suprising that Conan just did the best episode of hot ones ever and Sean noticing that and conducting the interview like that...legends
“He’s affordable”
OK, this was the best episode, by far!
the utter concern in sean's after conan ate the last wing has me cryin
What a episode. What a  guy. . Fire
I don't see how there's any way to actually hate Conan! That dude is f****** fire! One of the funniest episodes I have seen on Hot ones, maybe other than Key and Peele
Conan got lost in the sauce.
Best guest EVER!!!!!
He might be the most irritating person on earth.
LOLed at this so much 😂😂 and kind of worried about Conan after the episode 😅 He's truly a legend, only uses himself and people he works closely with for his humour. Never puts people down, is never mean. Been my idol since day one. With you all the way Conan!!
We need Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon on here too!!! 😅
This man is one of my favorite human! Now this episode bring me back here, some of the last couple guest were not my favorite...
Conan you're the best to ever do it
Didn't Sean told Shakira, last week, she's his last guest of the season?  Not ok, Sean.
Conan is the best.
"HES AN AFFORDABLE DOCTOR"
I AM LEGIT SQUIRMING WITH EXCITEMENT
Conan is a comedic genius 😂😂😂
He made me laugh so hard when he put too much hot sauce and I was like noooo 😂😂
I LOVE THIS MAN AHHAHAHAHHAHA
GREATEST OF ALL TIME
I’M SCREAMING I’M SCREAMING I’M SCREAMING
This has been the best episode yet, I have not laughed like this in any other episode.!!!!!!!
legend
I'm ting done with this dude. The playing to the camera. The trying to be relevant is sad
Wow. Absolutely unhinged. I love it.
Conan has produced thousands of hours of comedy. Much of it legendary. I dont know if anything he has done is better than this insane few minutes. I will watch this over and over.
i liked conan before. i like him more now.
Conan you deserve nothing but respect, for your comedic talent and for your absolute professionalism. A phenomenal episode that had me in tears, Bravo.
Awesome, great finale! 😀
Best guest ever
Actually really good material the best hot ones show ever 😂
I like many others grew up on Conan, always preferred him over any other late night. He is truly a global treasure
getting such a high value compliment from Conan is like nothing else I bet
This one is the funniest ever.
This is classic Conan.  Everything we've loved about him for 30 years.  I'm glad to see him do this and I second his comment about the quality of "your" interviews.  They are top notch.
Best fkn episode EVER!!!!
One of the best !
Legendary
Conan the greatest of all time
Well, there we have it, folks. No one will ever be able to say they did it better than Conan O'Brien! The undisputed king of reactions on Hot Ones!
Best episode ever. 1b views coming up. Conan is a legend.
Coco!
CONAAAN! He was too hot for the wings!  I haven’t gone back to rewatch episodes yet, but I will be watching this again and again, legend and total comedic inspiration! I get why some people don’t like or get his wackiness and overt absurdity but I do! The show has been broken by THEE CONAN OOOO’  BRY-YON!
The most epic episode everrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!
I got heartburn just by watching.
The craziest anyone has ever looked on this show
i don't like Conan but he kind of killed it? great episode
We laughed. We cried. We experienced the ups and downs of life in less than 30 minutes. That was beautiful
This is your sign if you haven't listened to Conan Obrien needs a friend, his podcast, to go ahead and start from the beginning and don't skip any. Funniest person maybe ever
GOAT 🐐
I think Conan just won the game.
Conan He's the MAN, he's THE GOAT
What an absolute legend!
What a buffoon.
Some comedians carry props with them.  Conan takes people with him to be props.
All shy and humble at first, said he not good with spice, proceed to drink the whole bottle of hotsauce😂😂😂😂
The more Conan puts himself out there, the more I realize he is STARVED for attention. I know he makes jokes about it, but it's glaringly obvious now. Less is more.
Where am I going to see him wear that jacket again question mark
Was waiting for a Jordan Schlansky cameo but the doctor works as well.
What an absolute DAWG.
Probably the best episode of hot ones yet.
CoCo is amazing. Is he human or some mythical creature?
What a beast
I've watched soo many of these but this one Is at the very top Conan is CRUSHING IT! 🔥🤣
😂😂😂..the best one. Way to send off season 23..Conan...your my spirit animal!!..❤
I wonder if Sean was nervous or felt some type of way about this guest. Conan has a long career at this format.
Conan is the goat of late-night. Undisputed. Rip norm.
Wow. annnd once again Conan takes a popular pre-existing  format and finds a way to break new ground, displaying his unending relevance.  Also... that was HELLA FUNNEH! Much luv to both!!!
Conan O'Brien is the GOAT!
Best episode!!!!! I got tears, he’s as insane as usual!
What a legend!
Greatest episode of all time
Wut was that???
Hands down the best one yet.
conan is the best love you conan
21:07 I bet his kids were embarrassed while watching that 😂😂😂
Salute to Conan! Been a fan since 2007 great episode!! I need an update on what happened after recording 😂
Insane Conan 😂😂😂 I hope your recovery goes well
Amazing
This episode is Emmy-material.
The word is "iconic"
This was like a Jim Carrey bit, but actually funny.
Probably the best episode yet
Conan is a legend
Him licking the hotwing killed me
This is by far the greatest episode of Hot Ones I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing
top 5.fucking tremendous
This is the best episode of the whole show. Conan is just a master of his craft and deserves all the attention! love the man 🧡
Same birthday here with my granny. Happy birthday Conan🎉🎉
Conan the Immortal
wow Conan is a flippin beast bro !
Truly sensational. This might be the best episode. Conan… wow. What a treat
Conan! You are the GOAT. Next we gotta get Andy
👏…👏…👏..👏..👏. 👏. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
That's show business baby
Episode of the year!
This was hands down the best episode. And not because of Conan, I was expecting a muscly barbarian with a giant sword when I clicked the link. No but seriously, I love Conan. I used to fall asleep to his late night show when I was a kid in a bunk bed with my brother, and wouldn't turn the TV off until MASH came on.
Conan O'Brien, A LEGEND.... Conan O'Brien, your Favorite Comedian's Favorite Comedian
I have no idea what just happened there.  Was that real or a joke?  If he really ate that much he is in trouble.
Conan you wonderful psychopath
Call the wife!!
I met conan during a festival in Thailand he was amazing to see in real life. Such a nice guy.  actually exactly one year ago this Saturday.
waiting so long for conan
Conan is legend ❤
Guys' get Jon Stewart!
Well, that was just horrific.   I went into today having no opinion about Conan O'Brien one way or another, and now I think he's the least funny person I've ever had the misfortune of watching.   I look forward to never again seeing him.    Which, frankly, should be pretty easy.
Only the second comment I have EVER posted online. (First was after Neil Peart died-I've played the drums for 45 years.) This may be your best interview ever. Definitely top 10. I've seen over 150 of them. Totally  different path than expected. It has inspired me to request/beg, …you have to get Louis Black next season. PLEASE!
Classic Conan tbh. The man is a living endless entertainment machine...
Conan is the G.O.A.T.!!!!!!
Bravo Conan!  great episode!  The host does ask the best questions.
Seriously impressive
I never wanted this episode to end. Conan is actually funnier when things are unscripted which makes him the goat of talk show hosts.  Can't wait to watch that new show.
I reckon that's gotta be one of the best episodes ever !! ...madness!!
WE ARE GETTING THE GREATEST SHOW IN THE WORLD
I love Conan still grew up with him like many did watched his show from the very start and he was the young hip late night guy for Gen X and he is still just as sharp as ever.
I feel for the next guests, the goat has raised the bar to a new standard
Hands down the best guest and best episode of the whole show.
Best thing I have watched in a long time. Brilliant.
Conan's Magnus Opum.
"...a Charlie Rose show where you eat hot wings" was just brilliantly true. 😂
“Call the wife!” sent me 😂😂😂
This is the first time I have watched a full episode of Hot ones and it rocked🎉🎉 Go Conan❤❤
Love how they've edited this. Sean was matching Conan on sauce quantities, but the camera always stayed on Conan. When your guest is crushing it, he gets the attention. Conan has one-upped Steve-O.
Torilla tavataan
Oh MY GOD, Conan is THE BEST!!! This is the best episode of hot ones for sure!!!! This man is a legend, the dedication to the craft is amazing, cant wait for the MAX show, been waiting it for long time now, cant believe its finally here!
Conan is a legend. Might be the best episode yet!
CRAZIEST EPISODE EVER. THE BEST. OH MY GOD
Incredible! Just absolutely Incredible!
God I love this man. One of the best interviewers ever. Up to you who I'm talking about
There is no way Conan is not dead inside
This man deserves a meme that matches the level of this episode
National treasure
Pure comedic chaos. Conan is such a legend - officially the new GOAT of Hot Ones
‘Can I keep these’ *Pockets half eaten wing*  Love it
People in a thousand years will look at this video as a landmark event
This episode was a reminder of how much I love Conan and how little respect I have for dj khaled.
"this one...I'm not gonna lie...tastes like gasoline...it's good, peeking through..."
13:59 😂😂😂
Easily the best interview Hot Ones has done. 10/10
So, Conan went right to the hospital from this shooting right?
HAHAHAHAHAH
“Letterman and…I don’t remember the other one” oh he’s still mad (I would be too)
Jeezzz
"he's not the best, but definitely available" 😆😆😆💀
Got to be one of my favorite episodes for sure!!
my eyes are blind, but I think I'm enlightened as well!
Jesus christ Conan beasted that
what a beast
A legend.
I suggest having seedless grapes around. They might have a different cooling effect other than milk. All due respect to grapes with seeds.
I would have loved to have seen Sean interviewed by Conan on Late Night as well, these are two people great at making an interview work and allowing people to relax into their stories.
The best episode EVER!!!
Ah the ole “can i take the bones” bit, classic Conan
This is the Hot Ones Holy Grail.   Conan is my generation's Johnny Carson.  I truly believe in my heart that he is the greatest human to have ever lived.....what a masterclass in balancing the comedy with nuggets of wisdom and sincerity.
this is one of the goat episodes of hot ones. Some how even better then I thought it would be
The greatest late night comedy host in tv history.   I miss his bits with the obscure characters before guests. Nobody has ever done late night like him.
I know I say this just about every episode, but good lord this has to the most epic, the wildest and the overall greatest episode of Hot Ones. Conan has always been one of my favorites and this is why.
Always devoted to you, Conan
😳
Conan the GOAT
Is it just me that thought the water buffalo story at 9:50 coincidentally mirrored his experience hosting The Tonight Show, he jumped on the show, rode the chaos of Jay Leno’s presence, and got hit hard when he was thrown to the 12:30pm slot and left.
A new best ever episode.
Conan never disappoints
I mean.. it's Conan and Sean... It's GOING to be good.
Unfortunately, the way Conan ate these wings made me grimace in disgust towards the end of the interview. I literally had to turn away at one point. The dribble and spit was disgusting.
Conan O'Brien Can't Taste a Thing
As someone who bought the Last Dab Xperience I was screaming when he saturated his wing in the sauce. More than a few good sized drops is pushing it for me and I can't imagine the pain he was going through internally. I think his acting skills made it look like nothing but he was dying on the inside. You could see his face get so red! He's gonna regret that while sitting on the toilet later.
A.B.S.O.L.U.T.E.     L.E.G.E.N.D.
LEGEND
I want to know if he actually needed a hospital after this. 😂 I get burns just from touching jalapeno.
best episode ever.
Conan equels pure comedy
I am waiting for someone’s redemption arc who missed out on eating all ten wings😮
Coco is a G ❤
CONAN WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND RIDICULOUS! It was like seeing the Eclipse in totality all over again, I couldn't believe me eyes!
LOLOLOL CONAN IS THE GOAT! Made me LOL 😂
I love the Arroyo bit. He has full trust in his doctor, slowly realizes his doctor is questionable at best, but accepts it as he's affordable. 😂
Legend.
Bless Conan for going above and beyond. Best one yet.
BEST EPISODE!!!! LOVE CONAN!!
Back when Conan was getting the short end of the stick from Leno retiring and NBC giving him that time slot to a year later, Leno coming back and them telling Conan to kick rocks, I think every fan of the late night talk shows felt for Conan and knew he had every right to be bitter, and angry about the whole situation. What did he do though? He performed every episode like the showman that he is and for the last show he would ever do for them, he looked right into the camera while trying not to get choked up and genuinely thanked all of the people at NBC that worked with him and gave him his shot to be somebody over the 25-30 years he was there. He then took a second and looked right into the cameras while getting a little teary eyed and told all of his fans and audience how absolutely blessed and thankful he is for each and every one of their support and that he would never forget it. He also said that they should never be cynical because nothing good ever comes from it and as long as you work hard and stay true, good things will happen. I have never forgotten that moment because not only did he have every right to be at least a little cynical, I think it was kind of expected and he still chose to take the high road. And now he's on Hot Ones absolutely killing it, just like he has done with everything for the last 40+ years. Bravo Conan!
lol Conan is the best guest that's been on the show in years! This was hilarious 😂
"I dont think theres a wing here, that I cannot eat like its ice cream."  Few mins later: "Dr. Arroyo could you please step in"
Conan's totally right about reading the classics to learn comedy. Shakespeare invented the 'f*cked your mom' joke. Titus Andronicus, Act 4, Scene 2.
what tales 23:58 conan is talking about  i cant hear it properly
this is without A doubt the BEST thing I've ever seen in the whole wild universe! I'm shaking... like Conan! is he still with us after this?
And here I was worried about you. 👑
Best guest
Bravo Conan. Hands down best Hot Ones episode yet
WWOW!! Conan was like a CHAMPION!!    His face must be on FIRE!! God bless him!!
There will never be a better episode. It's time to just cancel the show.
Favorite episode. Round of applause for Conan. Legend 👏🏼
No shade but imagine him "matching the guest" with Conen on this!!!! It would have been chaos 😭
Absolutely Unhinged 😂😂😂
If the show would get cancelled after this it would be a worthy finale. What an inferno.
Legendary episode status.
Yea this is by far the best episode ever haha
This was one of the most entertaining episodes ever, Conan face after he drank the last Experience 🤣 😅😮
How much ❄️ did he do before filming this
Conan literally found his inner Chris Farley 🎉
amazing episode
best episode ever period
Anyone who grew up watching Conan on late night recognized that doctor immediately 😅
Funniest one
21:11 Oh, he may regret that decision.  22:53 Oh there will be a peak. Later.
That camera angle at 4:16 with the last 3 hot sauces ….   The foreshadowing after Conan asked if any of the sauces are hot is too funny 😂
Man Conan is a legend
Charlie Rose show where they eat hot wings 🌹🍗
Best episode ever
Best Hot Ones of ALL TIME! this would break the internet if you also had Andy Richter next to him OMFG the comedy that would happen!
I was on edge if he was going to accidently touch his eyes.
Thats why we love Conan. He is a legend !
He's the best. The best bit ever 😅
It was a mistake to watch this while feeding my newborn! 🤣🤣🤣🤣. Now I’m off to wipe the milk off her face lol
Friggin’ legend
Okay that was one of the best episodes ever 😂
Conan is dying at the end, yipes
Sean was not playing off of Conan at all what a nerd
I´d love to see Sona and also Jordan on the hOT ONES chair
The doctor checks both carotid arteries 😂
This is the most fun interview
I usually watch the full thing, but I can’t tell if Conan is hard as nails or if he’s gonna cry on the way home. 😂
Conan is the final boss! XD
I was so worried he’d touch his eyes! For comedy!!!!
Yes, a great guest for me, selfishly! The mid 30s regular white dude this lands. I love all them but this one crushed.
Conan The Spice Lord: Call the wife!!!! 🤣
This has to be the most impressive poker face AND one of the best interviews ever on this show.   Truly amazing
Conan: "Let's see Sean Evans wing." Dr. Aroyyo: "Something wrong? Conan? You're sweating..."
No question: Thumbs up before watching the video!!! Congrats to the HOT ONES team, for finally getting Conan.
Legend is here
Sauce so hot it turned a comedian crazy and angry😆😆
Conan basically gets possessed by the ghost of Chris Farley for a minute around 21:00. 😂
this is the best episode ever
This was the best one by a mile
*slow claps*
Best episode ever
Conan will forever be my favorite late night talk show host. He is the king of late night
Conan no sabe lo mucho que lo amo. ❤
Huh I didn"t even know Conan O"Brian was still alive  😂
Conan is the best. Just when you thought an episode of Hot Ones couldn't possibly be very unexpected.... after having seen so many. Somehow I came away as the one that was crying.
I think this cemented the fact that my favorite celebrity/favorite idol is Conan O'Brien, the guy is intelligent, funny, charismatic, caring, authentic, and simply a jack of all trades. I'm against celebrity worship and I think power and influence has the power to corrupt even good people, but while I don't idolize Conan, he's certainly my favorite person in media
BEST EVER🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉!
Well, if that wasn't the most unhinged episode of this show, idk what is
Dah bomb sauce just pouring out all over the table😂
This is the most effortless hot ones interview I've ever seen from a guy i would never expect to be able to handle spicy food well.
This has to be the best hot ones interview I have ever seen! Conan turns anything he is in into gold.
I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at such madness.  Well done!
Conan : check the pulse  Doctor: it's there  Conan : 💀
My God, I love that man. 😂
That escalated quickly 😂
This may just be the best thing ever
22:23
The ultimate absolute madman. Unreal.
When he refers to Letterman and, "the other guy" 😂
Drop the wing 😂😂😂😂 the WILDEST episode EVER!! I couldn’t stop laughing after the bomb onwards 😂😂😂 LEGENDARY!
I dont think he's funny. At all.
He's the best, no way around it
Now, bring on Jordan Schlansky.
Greatest episode ever!
This is one of the best episodes ever😂😂
The man’s internal temperature only went up two degrees, what a legend.
Last i expected to impress me with hot sauce was for sure conan O'brien but here we are.
This was the funniest episode ever 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This might be one of the best episodes yet!
I love conan so much hahaha this was amazing. He hasn't reached his peek yet and he is 61.
The BEST episode yet!!!
Conan rocked it!
The best ever
Has anyone seen Conan since filming this?
No one will ever top that!! 😂😂😂 I am dying!!
Best Ever - Need him Back
Two of the bests at their best. I so appreciate how much Conan clearly respects this show and gave a performance knowing how many people would be streaming this. And how impressive is Sean?! He's literally gotten every celeb you can imagine on this show. Next up he'll have a late night gig on HBO (sorry, "MAX") right after John Oliver.
Did he died?
Conan O'Brien. A man born without hinges.
Best one ever 😂
This was absolutely insane
This is it, the best episode of Hot Ones, good work everyone
Best interview you’ve ever done. Bravo.
best one yet
this was HILARIOUS!!!!
Me: Don't touch your eyes, don't touch your eyes!  The next day a scream comes from deep in the inner sanctum of the men's bathroom.
I was crying and howling when they zoomed on Conan’s watery bloodshot eyes… my god, so good!
Truly one of the best showmen of our generation
Conan will virtue signal any chance these days. Irish food tasteless....lol? Conan grew up wealthy and went to Harvard. The vast majority of Irish Catholics did not grow up with money.
Thanks Sean, it's been a great show! ❤ Now finally on to something new - can't wait to see what you're going to do next
First time ive seen Sean legit terrified.  As am I.  Conan was amazing!
Somebody get this man some antacid, STAT!
Instant Hall of Famer. That made my day.
This man is the literal definition of a showman. He's amazing. Thank y'all for finally getting him on.
what a legend
Conan demolished those sauces like no mortal can.
Conan is the best!! Thank you for having him on! ❤
🐐🐐🐐🐐
nothing can top this, long live king conan 👑
If he doesn’t end up with an ulcer, I’ll be shook.
If anyone ever uses the phrase 'commit to the bit' I will forever think of this as the yardstick for it.
Conan's a hot sauce savage! Making up for lost time growing up Irish Catholic! 🤣🤣🤣
where can i see water buffalo
A true entertainer!   I have been entertained!
I genuinely feel sick, that was amazing.
I loved every second of this episode lol
i love this guy so much.
Does anyone know where I can get his jeans jacket?
absolutely incredible.
Apparently red heads have a high pain tolerance. I guess this is a good example.
How I absolutely adore this  man <3
Conan is a genius.
Conan made SteveO look like a wimp!
My favorite moments was all of it.
Get JB and DT on the show pronto, and KH too. Her word salad and cackling would Niagara her forehead.🤣😂🤣😂
Conan is an absolute legend, never misses
I had been thinking recently about how a lot of the newer episodes with more famous movie stars have been tame- guests having a nibble before answering the questions for their press circuit. It's good to see Conan bring the chaos back! Stop warning the guests about da bomb- I love their reactions!
"your wings, your jacket. Take ownership on that side of the table!" That's Conan O'Brien! But with grace and style.
So proud of you Coco for finally doing Hot Ones and fully committed to it! Just bummed Sean didn’t ask about his baby, the iconic 92 Ford Taurus.
Dwayne Johnson needs to be on the hot ones! (Or alongside with Kevin hart as part 2)😊
When Sean talked about the animal segments, I was kind of hoping Conan would talk about Jared. Those two were chaotically funny
WOW & LOL plus YIKES. Legend.
Finally, a guest worth watching.  Been weeks....
Literally most unhinged interview of all time. Bravo
God, Conan is a pro! There’s nothing he wouldn’t do in the name of entertainment.
1.92 million views in 14hrs😮
I request Marina and the Diamonds interview
Wow…. Easily my top favorite thing I’ve ever see Conan do
That happens when you're high from spicy food 😂! Wonderful season final! 😍
This has been one of the best episodes I have ever watched in my life.
Conan there will never be another like him, once he passes Eric Andre can try to fill the void.
conan being this unhinged is hilarious 😂
Best episode ever by the one true king. Conan the Barbarian 👑
Conan knows what he's doing here. He wants to entertain people and show that he's one of the pros in this industry for a reason. Salute to this guy!
😂😂😂😂 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Hats off to the best!
Channeling Farley! I love it ❤
Of all the actors on the show, Conan outdid them all- you could tell that he was hurting on the last few but he played it off so well lol.
ALSO PLEASE POST THE UNCUT EPISODE WHEN POSSIBLE.❤
This is more unhhinged than Gordon, and I'm totally with it. 😂
CONAN IS THE GOAT
The single best episode ever!!!!
the red fingers waving around at 18:03 😂
Full send! Conan is awesome.
the legend!
I've never seen anything in my entire life that is more aptly described by the phrase "that was over 9000."
Hands down best yet! WOW😮🫣💪
Best episode hands down
The fact that his interview was informative while being crazy and funny at the same time speaks volumes
absolutely incredible.
Love Conan!!
I haven't laughed so hard in years.  Thank you Conan O'Brien.
Him putting the wings in his pockets and the dr killed me!!!!
Love it! Pure comedy 😂 we need a duo with Kevin hart and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Like if you agree :))
I was laughing until i became concerned at the end that he had lost his actual mind
Sean was terrified there, for a moment!  LOL
I will NOT forget April 18, Conan's new show. That was one heck of a plug.
Best episode of all time. Conan teaching life lessons
Conan definitely gave himself chemical burns on his face and hands for our entertainment. His commitment is unparalleled.
A masterclass in knowing your audience and delivering.
Might actually have to retire Da Bomb. Conan just totally destroyed it. Lol
Conan is a monster. He wants your job Scott
YES!!!
The greatest red head of all time
This is already a classic.
I hope they get the m*sturbating bear for next season opener
Fantastic!
Conan is a GOD!!!!!!!!  Dr. Arroyo just get a baseline temperature.... 😂😂😂
I've never liked this guy but respect where respect is due.
conan the goat comedian
Conan realy came prepared.
some of the best physical comedy I've seen in years
You know it's wild when Bobby Lee sharting looked mild in comparison. Instant classic
Seeing Conan insist repeatedly that everything is fine whilst chugging hot sauce and turning a progressively deeper shade of mauve as Shaun looks on in horror is magical.
That was obnoxiously vile
This is INCREDIBLE
I am impressed
Best episode ever 😂
20yrs from now, Conan's gonna be talking about buttered sausage
Conan is the best  Easy buckets
The greatest chapter on this show
This is not just the greatest hot ones interview, but the greatest interview to ever be recorded by mankind. This is what I would send aliens to describe our world. Thank you Consie
"There's funny stuff online all the time."
greatest episode of all time imo. I’m not sure anyone can match Conan fully losing it hahaha
😭😭😭😭😭
Sweet baby Jesus! He yams what he yams!
best
Connnannnn 🤩🤩🤩
Conans I like lol.  I like Conan's doctor too:))
You are the man
The best hot ones episode to date!! 🤍🤍🤣🤣🤣
Rivaling Eric andre as most insane gues
This was the episode we've all been waiting for! All hail Conan!
Nobody is gonna top Conan
I just witnessed the perfect game.
This was one of the best hot ones yet, so glad Conan finally was on this was worth the wait.
Only thing that might have been better is Conan and Norm McDonald doing the show together. RIP Norm.
I'm amazed he managed to miss his eyes at every step.
Conan is the best talk show host hands down
Conan is the GOAT🤣🤣🤣
Bring on Craig Ferguson with Sidney Sweeney so the mortals can see how it's done
It used to be, the one of the regrets I had about not being a celebrity is that I would never be a guest on Hot Ones.  But Conan just ruined that. There's no way anyone can be a better guest than this. He is the GOAT..
Best episode yet! 🔥
Conan really said POWER OVER SPICE IS POWER OVER ALL
amazing
Best show yet
Conan sticking the wings in a $700 jacket 😭🤣
Best episode no question.
REAL RECOGNIZES REAL
There will never be an ending to any youtube video as perfect as Conan giving his inspirational speech while drooling and losing his mind 😂😂😂
Best one, hot one.
I never realized till now that its mfing CONAN OBRIAN i want in the foxhole with me.
CONAN DA 🐐
Greatest. Episode. Ever!
I love you Conan.
Now bow to your king. Conan, the Barbarian of Spice
I may have googled to see if he was still alive after watching this
An instant classic! A hall of fame episode to the pantheon. I knew that Conan will be good, but he definitely over delivered and I'm here for it!
lolololololol
♥️
God I can't believe they got the GOAT so awesome
I have not laughed this hard in a long time. Wow. Lol
KEDAKAI! AS GOD MADE HER!
Conan will never have to try to be relevant because he will always be iconic. Love this man.
A fuggin mazing  ❤😂❤😂❤😂
This is an important moment in the history of the internet
T H E  G R E A T E S T  H O T  O N E S Episode
I was not prepared for this level of insanity. But then again, it is Conan, maybe I should have been.
CONAN IS THE BEST
That was great 🎉😂❤
Bravo, might be the best episode ever
This dude is an alien 😂😂 what a way to end a season 👏
In any media format, endeavour, interview, cameo…LONG LIVE CONAN!!! I will always follow wherever he goes. Excited for this show. 🎉🎉🎉❤❤
never had so much fun watching someone eat messily as I did watching this episode.
The GOAT 🐐
I am a simple 20 year old girl. I see Conan, I click.
THIS IS SO UNHINGED AND I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT
I could not stop laughing and gasping.  Conan for the win.  What a perfect season ending!
I Love Conan! Thankyou ❤
He is an absolute MONSTER!!! in the positive sense of the word... if that's even possible... But... I can't predict the future... So I don't know...
The one and only Conan O'Brien❤❤
Best episode of all time 😂
Absolute classy comedy! Conan delivered, maybe the most memorable interview in Hot Ones.
Way to make up for that train wreck ice spice episode. God bless Conan.
I haven’t laughed that hard in a long time. Tears.
He is embarassing every other guest and channeling his inner Chris Farley at the end, hillarious!
Conan, just got me laughing uncontrollably especially towards the end, so worth it!
One thing that I’ve always loved Conan is his sincerity! He is simply the best 😊
I want to see what happened after the show ended to conan.....😂😂😂😂
Conan literally transformed into Barney Gumble from the Simpsons before our eyes.
Conan is SO AWESOME!!!! 😎👍🏻😅🤣🍗🔥☄️❤️‍🔥 BRING HIM BACK!!!! I’d love to watch him even 10x going nuts and eating spicy wings 🔥😅😎❤️‍🔥💫☺️🍗☄️
I have a habit of reading comment sections a lot. I think Conan may be one of the only known figures who is almost exclusively beloved across the board.
Conan. Legend. Nothing tops this!🍗🥵
Series finale. Nothing is going to top this episode. Not unless someone rubs the sauce into their eyes. Or snorts it. That’s about the only way this episode gets topped.
First hot ones spit take. Incredible.
The only thing that the sauces did was elevating Conan Energy even more. Incredibile.
CONAN THE GOAT. Legitimately one of the best episodes ever.
OK. That was pretty crazy. No.1 "wing killer" just there.
An absolute master class. Best episode in my opinion in a LONG time. Probably ever. Legend
Hot Ones The Last Dab: Xperience = $22.00; Shipping = $8.99. I think you need to change your pricing model
conan died of an ulcer 18 hours later
Conan must have had a Bobby Lee experience x10000000000 after this recording
Conan is the goat... He is so committed to entertainment that it's hard to beat! He was literally taking swigs of hot sauce!
Oh my goodness.  Conan goes all out and I mean all out!!!! I think he burst a blood vessel in his eye.  And the snot…..  bravo bravo!!!
"Read widely and read well. There's comedy in the old testament. There's comedy in the new testament. You can read all kinds of stuff. Just don't lock yourself in to: It's gotta be some comedy from the last ten years. No! There's great comedy out there. It was written a long time ago. What's funnier than Don Quijote? Sancho Panza? You know? This is good stuff. The classics are funny. There's funny everywhere." -Conan O'Brien
JUST WOW!!! all the interviews that you did in the past years!! THIS TOPS EVERYTHING!!!! WOW
No one is doing it like Conan. My alltime favorite talk show host and comedian 🤗👏🎉
What a madman!
The no spice growing up joke until he was 52 was the best intro!!!! 😂Northern Ireland 🇮🇪 is ❤
LEGENDARY!!!!!!!!
👑🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
Legend.
I see Conan I click like
I love the episodes where Shawn completely loses control of the interview.
I expected him, more than anyone else, to be completely destroyed by the most mild of the sauces…then again, I wouldn’t put it past him to be so committed to the bit that he literally couldn’t feel the reaction until the cameras stopped rolling. GOAT.
GOAT
🐐🐐🐐
Conan goes a different show and again makes it the Conan show ...
Best episode ever! Conan is a genius!
Best hot ones guest ever period
Bro is the funniest dude ever
He defeated the sauces.  I never thought it was possible but Conan won Hot Ones.
Conan can't help but do that. This is why comedians die young.
Conan just gave Sean a way to retire in a high note. If he quits after this i won't hold it against him. DO IT SEAN END ON A HIGH NOTE!!!
Is Jordan schlansky going to be on the new show?
Bruh… Simply epic.
One of the great episodes. I really admire how Conan didn’t want to ruin Sean’s suede jacket because of his foolishness. Such a good human being.
You forget how tall Conan is until you see him standing next to Sean. Absolutely legendary episode.
Yet another guest making DJ Khaled look like an absolute 🐈 !
I can't imagine Conan's toilet after this.
coco is a legend
Conan is going to DESTROY the toilet after this, pure comedy
I watch Hot Ones every week and think it is one of the best show around.  I have never laughed harder at an episode than this one.  Prime Coco, still the funniest in the biz.  Nice work Sean and Hot Ones team.
Fave late night host ever. He stays true to himself. Stay weird Conan, stay weird 🎉
I vote Conan for president ❤
Of all the Hot ones. This is the best one. I love how Sean is enjoying himself. Conan is a legend.
Now and forever, king of the prodigal Irish, if he wasn't real his physical form would be a racist joke, the bluest man to ever challenge the last dab, Conan O'Brien
i unsubbed after ice episode, subbed again after this.
I really feel like 23:00 ought to be a meme. The image of Conan, eyes red and tearing, face smeared with hot sauce, screaming confidently about being perfectly fine, is too good to just let fade into obscurity.
Conan makes every prior guest look like butter.
Best guest ever.
I wish they also had Andy Richter with Conan.
Conan closing the season like Conan would do. 🎉👏👏👊
Yeah, Coney!!! 🌶️
i love conan <3 <3 <3
Legendary interview.
I’ve probably watched every hot ones episode, I have never laughed so hard had me crying 🤣😂🤣
THE best!
What a great episode to close off the season! And even Sean was going "please no, don't do it" 😂😂😂 thank you for the entertainment!!! 🙌🏼🍻
Coco dude , Coco!!!!!
This is quite literally the best hot ones ive ever see
He will literally do anything for a laugh 😂
“It’s just starting” he said about da bomb. Legendary.
It feels extremely appropriate to tell everybody here to search for "Conan's Chaotic Bidet Ad Read" after this UNHINGED episode from our beloved madlad. You're welcome.
Best episode yet, I love Conan so much
I love this man
BEST episode Ever..Thank you so much..🙌
Conan might be my favorite guest so far. The pocket wings and drinking the hot sauce were hilarious 😂
We needed this after that horrible Ice Spice episode 😂
letssssssssssssss gooooooooooooooooooooooooooo <3 <3 <3 <3
Consey wonsey took a wing from firsty feasty.
Absolutely unhinged and it’s incredible
This was absolutely GOLD. Conan is great as usual…
Will not be beat. Best episode ever
Dudeee, what an episode 😂
Nothing is as comedic as watching this show for years and knowing the full context of how devastating Da Bomb is followed by 16:47 — 16:53
Conan is an entertainer through and through.   He can be highly cultured and educated and then he can be crude and childish but always in an entertaining way. One of the best episodes of Hot Ones only thing missing was Sona and Jordan Schlansky
Best episode ever
when you score 110% on a test
This was a great episode, Conan is a comedy legend, but I just wish it wasn't so gross watching Conan eat. Rubbing sauce on his face and drooling milk and wiping food off his face just to put more food on his face and talking with his mouth open and full of chewed up wings 😂
BRING BACK CLUELESS GAMER!!!!
As absolutely brilliant as Conan was in this, gotta shout out some great camera work and editing too. Nice job by all involved.
Greatest ever talk show host ladies and gentlemen!
Legend
conan is the best ❤🇦🇺
Hahaha.😅 Love Conan O'Brien..
It was awesome hearing Sean laugh so much
Conan doing the hot wings challenge… DREAMS REALLY DO COME TRUE
S23? How many seasons in year do they have
No person on the planet is as naturally funny as Conan.
This is hands down my favorite episode so far 😂 I love Conan!
Absolutely brilliant  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5/5
How do you proceed after that)
😂😂😂😂😂 another great
Conan is the best! Such a great comedian and this will be a certified Hot Ones classic! He’s one of a kind.
Conan hit his midlife crisis eating these wings.
the legend of Conan.
Conan stop!😂😂😂
Get Taron Egarton!
bonkers
This is, genuinely, the best Hot Ones interview I have ever watched. I don't think it can be topped. Conan was just funny all the way and Dr. Arroyo was such as funny character to have on the show. From the moment the episode started he just went full comedy mode, I have never laughed this hard at an interview. I started tearing up halfway through the interview just because of how funny it was, it's just so good. It's such a fitting season finale. What a legendary figure, I'm so glad the Hot Ones team got him on as the season finale.
We don't deserve Conan. Best interview of the whole series for me, and that's saying something.
He is the intelligence in Hollywood entertainment industry  You can believe that.
This was the greatest mashup in internet history. Well worth the wait! Conan delivered more than I ever would've imagined. This was a masterpiece.
Absolutely. Epic. 👏🤣
Thank you so much for doing this, Conan was as expected absolutely hilarious, will definitely be tuning in to his new show!
Greatest episode ever. Incredible.
Best one ever 😂 I love Conan so much he’s a lunatic 😂
best show so far
"Charlie Rose with hotwings" is on-point
The best!!!! Conan you’re a legend! ⚡️
Started off good, didn’t find the rest of it funny. Pass on this one.
I hope Conan realizes how much we all still love him and his weird weird self
So this is where Conan went!
"I am what I am."  - Gandhi, Popeye, and A-COCK-A-ROO
Bring all the best contestants together and make them eat until they quit and only one is left. Conan wins easily
This is by far the best episode of the entire series. My favorite before this was the Gordon Ramsay interview. I also loved Shia Leboufs and Shaqs.
I hate this term, because it's grossly misused. However, this was EPIC! What a finale. I've never been a huge Conan fan and thought this might get a little lame, but boy was I wrong.  Dude annihilated it. What a legend. Real talk though, how bad do you think it was the next day...? Must have been brutal.
Even Coolio did not drink the sauce from the bottle lol RIP
Conan is the 🐐 absolute masterclass
off the rails!!
BTW, did anyone caught the moment he ask for the name of the sauce and Sean says: Smokey J and he replied: Smokey J? Anything I need to know about this sauce? Like he wasn't talking about the sauces anymore but about Jay Leno, that was smooth as silk, only man on the planet that can pull  off something like that.   What An  Absolute Legend
Conan is the goat
RIP his poor stomach, what a legend
That was absolutely insane. Conan is amazing. His remote videos on youtube are really funny.
The number of times I yelled something like NO, CONAN NO, CONAN WHY, STOP, CONAN STOP
OH MY GOSH. This was the most incredible interview. I haven’t laughed this hard in ages. Conan is one of a kind. Legend!
The king of Hot ones
Words can’t describe how much I love Conan O’Brien ❤
Conan is a true Mad Lad. Nothing but respect.
Conan is King!
That was epic…
I love Conan!! Real Redhead Redemption. ❤❤❤
his toilet!
What an absolute legend. 👏👏 I think we all might have just watched what will end up being known as the best episode of Hot Ones.
Hands down my favorite episode. I love Conan so much.
Conan O'Brien is literally the G O A T
That was my favorite episode ever
Bruh did Conan just do the best Hot Ones of all time?! What a work of art this is! 🔥🔥
Best episode ever.
I never thought I'll say this about Conan, and I bet nobody ever called him this, but he is an Absolute beast
This is one of the best Hot Ones of all time.
God I miss him on TV
I really need to see Craig Ferguson on this show
I think conan high on hot sauce is the only guest that gave sean a hard time 😂
CONAN! Oh wow, can he close out every Hot Ones season from now on? It was a pleasure to watch through the tears.
Conan is *Comedic Chaos* 😂😂
That was INSANE!
This dude is a madman 😂 I love it
"Whats wrong with me!? Why cant i feel!?" Such a classic conan line
Conan made an amazing eloquent ending speech and even promoted his show without any stutters whilst his intestines, tongue, mouth and brain are on fire. Truly an amazing person.
Can’t wait for his travel show! Conan is the man!
There's never been a guest this feral. 10/10
conan: "show business is: you are getting the greatest show in the world"  also conon: *proceeds to give us the greatest episode of hot ones*
Hands down the best episode. From the professionalism to the comedy, this episode has it all.
Yes that was so funny. I love it
Going from an industry plant that you couldn't pay to have a personality, to this; is amazing
holy
Jim Carrey vs Conan O Brian.
I'm 10 minutes in and this is the best episode of this show yet, and probably forever. That is what I expected but I'm still very happy about it.
he said “i’m not gon lie i’m starting to feel this one” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ive seen every episode... Conan Wins 100%
The aftermath is worse.
Love me some Conan❤️
BEST.  EPISODE.  EVER.
😂😂😂😂😂 Conan O'Brien is the best
conan caught Rabies
WE NEED Jordan Schlansky ON THIS SHOW
Savage
Conan writing at David letterman’s desk was quite literally the practice of manifestation lol
Great episode.  Sean IS a fantastic interviewer, of course- but I've always been a little suspicious of how absolutely every guest points it out.  Then Conan says "It's very important for me to say"- I wonder to what extent, if at all, the guests are asked to point that out?  ...
There's a reason why he was the best talk show host!
"I don't fear your wings, man" said with a complete straight face, then a smirk.
ading a comment for engagement's sake. that was "the hottest"
A fellow proud graduate of 1998 College!
Conan O'Brien can't stop
This might be my favorite episode. Shout outs to Shaun and Conan, thank you for another flamin hot episode!
Oh lawdy lawdy lawdy.... here is where Conan finally lost his mind. Buh bye sanity.
Best   ....  ...  Hot Ones  ...  ...  ever  !!!!!!!!!   >>>>>  Ty King Conan  <<<<<
EPIC SEASON FINALE!!!
Horrific, unhinged, terrifying... keep it up, this is the best episode.
Gene wilder..... he is the new gene wilder!
Never seen Shaun actually seem out of his element...
one of the best episodes ever!
I dont think your doctor likes you from how he checked your pulse. 🤨
If I don’t watch his new show after seeing this, it would be inexcusable
I'm guessing this is supposed to be funny, but it was hard to watch. I can't tell if he's coked out or trying so hard to be funny it's cringeworthy. Talking with food in his mouth, the spittle, the stuff on his nose ... it was just gross. The doctor was humorous at first ... until he asked him to put his germ-filled chicken legs in his pockets. Ugh. I'm glad I wasn't eating while watching this. I wish they'd have ended the season with someone else. Anyone else really.
Best episode ever!
It's a Conan Renaissance! It's such a lesson that you can *think* the worst thing ever happened to you 14 years ago, and it leads you to the happiest most fulfilling time in your career. =) Love it.
This was thee most crazy/outrageous episode of hot ones I have ever watched! Imo, it takes a lot to beat Gordon Ramsays episode, but Conan O'Brien takes the cake
his norm interviews still are grrat to this day... chairam of the bored
He was destroyed by the end good lord
I miss when actual comedians hosted late night t.v.
23:01 That "I'm fine" while dying inside is the story of my life.
This was insanity. Conan is the GOAT.
Its a cool show, but i admit i have never seen a full episode. The second i saw conan, i knew i had to watch the whole thing, and im so glad i did
I love conan o'brien and yes Shawn Evans is a legend . Keep doing what you do,  hope everything is goin good it's always a good laugh from the videos
Wow..someone's going to have to go a LONG way to top that one. Great job Conan..!
10/10 episode. Haven’t laughed like that in awhile. Conan is King
I thought watching Elizabeth Olson was impressive but this man scared me. He was too good. No one should be this funny, this cool.
Super fantastic explosive with full of spicy flavors in yo face episode!!!!!! Coco can take the heat and then some! LOL WoW 😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉
Fantastic episode
The most chaotic show I've ever seen in hot ones
Dude, Conan is hard. He plays off the heat so well. He takes pain like a real Irish Catholic.
BEST INTERVIEW EVER! First time seeing Sean not being able to keep up with a guest! I couldn't stop laughing at Conan! Great season finale!
Legit Apex Hot Ones episode. I'm folded.❤‍🔥
IT HAPPENED!!! FINALLY!!!
Best Hot One's episode of all time!
Wings turned this mf into cosmo Kramer
oh my god i laughed so hard that there are tears in my eyes, I look like IM the one who ate the spicy wings
That was so unhinged but also entirely hinged
" What is wrong with me? Why cant i feel?"
Loved it!! Conan is a Legend!!!!
I honestly thought Conan still was doing his late night show but I just googled it. He's been retired since 2021, wow. I've loved him since he was on SNL. He bodied the wings...
Omfg this is insaaaaane! 🤣🤣🤣😭💀
my favorite episode are you kidding me
i sweat watching this
This is crazier than I thought it would be
The spice goat for comedy Gold..
Best episode ever.
Best episode ever! Love!!!! CONAN ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
He's a modern-day Paul Bunyan.
Probably the most comfortable guest he has ever had on the show.
pretty epic... woulda been thee most epic of if sona and jordan made a cameo
This is what I have been waiting for.  That's as raw as it gets, cheers.
We all knew the Da Bomb was going to make this one legendary interview. I was waiting and it didn't disappoint.
Why 2 tables?
One of my fave comedians of all time. Been waiting for this for a long time. So much love for Conan 😊💕
There will never be another Conan 🥵👑😂
End the show. You’re never topping this.
I need Conan to live forever.
I'd like to report a problem- there appears to only be one thumbs up button.
Almost skipped this one, so so glad I didnt
Conan just became the Hot Ones 🐐
I was expecting this episode to be hilarious, and one of the best ones ever. I was not disappointed.
Best show ever ! This is how you smash wings 👌
What a legend!
❤😅😂
I'm sweating just watching this
Hot wings…hotter hair
It must have been such a humbling experience for the staff to see such an amazing performance from such a legend. Conan is not only a national treasure but a World's treasure.
This is a close as we're ever gonna get to a Chris Farley Hot Ones episode.
Theres your red headed north american giant. Conan is a beast.
I kept expecting Conan to rub his👀👀
Game Changer. Possibly the best guest performance you’ve ever had on the show. Nice work, guys!
Best episode of all time!!
Funniest person the world has ever known, truly. If you aren't aware, do yourself a favor and go watch literally any of his travel remotes.There was talk of gerbils.
I usually watch these at 1.5x speed, but this one didn’t need it. This was fantastic.
LOVE!!
Just wow.
By far, no contest, the best Hot Ones ever. Conan is an icon, a living legend. Unreal.
Amazing.
Great job Coco.
I was mesmerized. Incredible. Best Hot Ones of all time.
@Brittany_Broski
This performance will go down in history as a classic. What a masterful appearance!  Stunned.
@Brittany_Broski
The is the best hot ones ever made.
bu ne ya.mehmet ali erbil e bağlamış.
absolute. best. episode. ever. best. entertainer. ever.
That escalated quickly.....
Camera man and vertical stripes....ehh no.
By far the best episode.
And that's why he's the GOAT
Most excellent thing I’ve seen in a while! Wow that had me rolling, what an absolute champ!
My man made a Popeye impression funny in 2024 — LEGEND
What’s wrong with me?? Why can’t I feel??? Lol 😂
Best Hot Ones ever? Me thinks...
Conan is a Treasure and Most be Protected
Conan's summary of Warren Harding's presidency is hilarious and the hidden gem of this video: "He was in the oval office, like, three days, and he wrote on a note, 'I am not fit to be president; this job is too hard.' And then to solve matters, he takes a train trip and dies mysteriously 'cause he ate some bad lobster. So, you gotta give it up for Warren G. Harding."
No one will ever do a better comedy bit. EVER. Conan is the GOAT.
Short interview but my God might be the best. Everyone loves Conan
The way Conan’s lips got so red after he ate the bomb sauce had me dying
What ever expectation I had for the Conan O'Brien interview, has been blown away....Jesus...
WHEN IS MATT PATT FROM GAME / FILM THEROY IS GONNA GET A TURN IN THE HOT SEAT
Greatest showman of our era. Conan The King  !
Conan is a Hot Sauce Monster!
Love Conan!!!! He’s the best watching him since 97’ only he could make me watch this show!!!!
@Britney Broski
Wow!! This definitely resets the fun bar for this program!  (Which is incredible already)      What a badass, disrupting the norm by being himself.  🙏💪.
best episode ever!
My childhood fav on the other side of an interview for once and with the creme de la creme of new school hosting no less.
He did great!
Arguably the best.
One of the best episodes and clearly the funniest one.
Conan is the 🐐
How can ANYBODY top this off??
ABSOLUTE LEGEND
He didn't have to go that hard. But then again, it's Conan.
i accidently got dabomb in my eyes....not bad
The best of the best, this guy. 🙌
He really is a SEASONED professional.
That was the best show ever 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Best episode yet!!!!
Surprised he didn’t link Maxx to Max Weinberg
Best Hot Ones guest of all time.
Conan is an absolute savage. The amount of willpower and self-control exhibited by him should not go understated. What an absolute master of comedy and himself!
What amazement did I just watch? I rarely, literally, LOL, but I had no protection from it watching this episode. When people say, "you crushed it, mate!" This episode needs to flicker above their head. Holy F, that was gold.
Distressed conan looks like bryan cranston.
Gold
Aint no ever abused the sauce this much. Conan what a legend
The greatest Hot Ones guest of all time!
this is going to be the best video of all time. Mark my words.
22:59 Sean couldn’t contain his laughter 😆
I didn’t think it was possible for Conan to top his unhinged live performance of the Monorail song at Simpsons Take the Hollywood Bowl but I was so, so wrong. What an absolute beautiful maniac.
This is the best Hot Ones ive ever seen
Watching was painful
For a guy who was raised on boiled ham, he is killing it. Team coco for life
Best episode ever!!!!
Legendary
He went from no spice to being the spice
NOW, THIS IS SHOW BUSINESS
Holy I have never loved this show more!! The COMEDY
What’s wrong with me?! Why can’t I feel?!    Conan Left em in the Dust!  Absolute Demolishment! Get It Gang!
Conan is an absolute legend for this
Happy birthday Conan👑
Love how they've edited this. Sean was matching Conan on sauce quantities, but the camera always stayed on Conan. When your guest is crushing it, he gets the attention. Conan has one-upped Steve-O.
yep the pulse... its there. 🤣
The 🐐
The best episode EVER ! Conan really brought it ! It was hilarious. The fake doc was an awesome touch.
this was like watching an athlete in the zone
Give Conan a napkin,,,,, geez!
One of the best episodes ever!
Jesus christ i was lolling on my office chair
This was Awesome 😂😂🎉🔥
Incredible
Conan killed it. He is #1 Hot Champ. This will be impossible to beat!
This isn’t going so good
22:42 the eye of the tiger
one of the best guests you'll ever have
he drank it 😂
f leno f jimmy team coco all the way
Love Conan ❤
I’ll never tire of this man. Been a huge fan since the summer of 1994 and he’s just always been part of my life . He’s an absolute gem.
I will forever love Conan o’brien . A comedian to be remembered.
What a legend, great show , probably the best one ever since this show started
Frogs can't wear jeans.
Conan was not only most underrated but best talk show host. You can tell he is genuinely the funniest compared to who his competition was.
CONAN CAME HERE TO PARTYY !!!!
"They used to call it HBO but people found that too popular."   As a Warner Bros investor, I know that pain lol
Конан О Брајан е вистински професионалец за најва на неговото ново шоу на ТВ МАКС 🙂😂🤣🙃
This is fantastic
This man is 100% Irish... he might not have the physiological capacity to recognize or taste spice.
I give him 4 years tops
Conan's lip became more red than his hair!
That was the hardest I've ever laughed on a Hot Ones
Conan is a legend. This medium is perfect for him
F#(%ing incredible
best episode yet!!
"The other guy" could never do better than this interview :) !
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!  Conan is an absolute legend. So happy to finally see him on a hot ones. Excited to check out his new show too. We love you Conan!
Conan is a gift on this Earth.
don’t know if Conan worked with Chris Farley on SnL, but at times this performance definitely reminded me of Farley. great interview Sean and crew!
I'd have to go drink a bottle of Pepto and treat the burns on my face and hands.
why can’t i feel!! 😂
Conan just became the goat of this show. AMAZING
GOAT!
What a great way to end the season!!
Lowkey feel like this episode is overrated, sterling k brown clears, Walter white clears
Hands down, best episode.  Bar is high
This was epic. Conan definitely committed to the bit 110%.
RESPECT CONAN ...BEST SHOW......E V E R !!! This one is gonna be tough to beat. ❤ Thank you for all those years of entertainment....many more to come. 😊
Being a Conan fan for almost a decade man he’s still a legend.
instant classic. conan is just the best
So funny.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 One of the best episode.
Best hot ones interview in history
I'm surprised no one has done it like this and it is definitely the best episode. And only Conan could have done it like this. He is what his favorite comedy is - being silly
Just EPIC 😂👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻🎉
Phenomenal
call the wife
Legend!
If this isn't the best episode of Hot Ones ever, it has to be up there. I'm hard pressed to think of more entertaining ones.
Conan: “was it a 4 year medical school?” Arroyo: “it was supposed to be” 😂😂😂
My hero, just missed him in Buenos Aires. My cousins said, you were in the same exact spot.
This was too good! One of the best Hot Ones.
This is got to be the Best Hot ones yet!! 😂😂😂
Now this is a proper season finale. What a showman! 👏
I hope Conan talks about this on his podcast. There's no way he didn't have any residual side effects when he got home if you know what I mean lol.
King Conan, hilarious & my favorite episode by far
Dude, this has been the best one yet, hands down!! Conan is hilarious!!! "Call my wife!!" 😂😂😂
A combination of the best of all time with the best of of all time
Trump looks young in this clip.
This is far and away the best episode of Hot Ones ever. Conan is an absolute legend. I couldn't stop laughing the entire time. I've never seen Sean fully fall out of character laughing.
So, like, they have to end the show now, right? No one is going to top this episode. Robin Williams could have given it a run for its money, but he's gone, so this is it. It's all downhill from here if they do another season.
Hands down, best hot ones guest so far.
Yes. Just yes.
I swear to god, Conan gets better at what he does with every single passing year.
Conan is my favorite entertainer and comedian alive. So pumped to finally see him on here!
This is the funniest Conan that I have ever seen.
Conan is a genius
I was genuinely scared when he drank the last one.
Best Guest Ever!!
Dude  Conan is mtfkn legendary 😂😂😂
with all the spice and Dr. Arroyo, i give Conan 4 years tops.
Dude....I knew Conan would be funny....but truly didn't expect him to go insane on them wings. Bravo
These kids don’t know….
the was by far the greatest episode ever, conan is a legend
Who loves conan ❤
Best Episode Ever!! Conan O'Brien, ladies and gentlemen!! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Hail the Irish man.
This is the closest thing we will get to the Joker. Lol😂
18:31
Unhinged brilliance. This tops the David Blaine episode. Goat finale
This mans the best
Best episode ever. Conan turned the tables! Unhinged, absurdist, with a throw-to side plot to boot. Genius.
Best...guest...ever. Conan is everything ❤
Conan 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Him and creig Ferguson are my favorites ❤
Wow!
We could save the oil crisis by refining Conans hair.... Cool show.
no one will ever to outdo Conan, he is the master. This episode will be talked about for generations!
Conan never hurt in ratings during writers strikes...take that in.
Best Hot Ones ever
Conan is the most ever
“‘I yam when I yam’, said Popeye and Gandhi” 😂😂😂😂😂
I think this is the peak of the show
This had me laughing out loud with tears streaming down my face. Conan absolutely destroyed this. What a legend!
I cried from laughing at the end
23:00 Another Meme potential on Hot Ones 😂
i’m not sure they realize it yet, but this may as well be the series finale. how can anyone follow this?
Instant classic!
Conan supports isreal
GOAT
The professional walked in and said “the hells all this?”
this is my first hot ones episode lol
Best fkn episode to date. Idk that this one can be topped
I will remember this episode in thirty years from now. Epic and classic Conan. Thanks!
Conan is the GOAT. What a way to finish the season.
Conan pretty much created his very own "hot pockets" here 😂
Them: Conan O'Brien is iNsAnE ... 👀  Me: Ya ! insanely hilarious 😅  A Gem 💎
Best to ever do it
This is the best and funniest episode of hot ones lol and I watch it frequently! Conan is a LEGEND! We were literally laughing out loud!
This is the greatest episode of Hot Ones ever made. 10/10
Yeah he was faking it, there is no way he would rub that hot sauce all over his hands and lick it off his fingers and still be fine with it, that would burn like crazy, why do you think chiefs wear gloves and masks whenever they deal with sauce at that hot rating.
Best episode ever.
Can someone check and see if Conan is still alive?
He's the opposite of DJ Khaled
Conan O Brien and Hot ones are the greatest combo
Is Conan okay? I'm honestly worried for his health after that.
By far the best episode 😂
this episode has to be breaking some records, that was amazing.
there is never gonna be another conan !!!
King...  It's Conan and the queen of cool under fire Jenna Ortega.
😲
If this is not the best episode I am a water bufalo
... and IT LEGITAMENT!
This was definitely one of the best episodes
Top 5 guest!  Props
The only reason Conan’s face is red is because he keeps yelling. 😂
This the best thing ever
It’s funny that conan referred to jay leno as the “other guy” and totally dismissed him 😂
When Conan left late night, late night as we loved it died
Standing ovation over here
This was, without a shadow of a doubt, the best Hot Ones episode released thus far.   Possibly the only people who can top this are: Eric Andre Aubrey Plaza Timothy Olyphant
Hands down one of the best episodes in the history of this show. Amazing!
Conan my hero, Happy Bday, didn't you almost die from Ted Turner on his pet buffalo?
The only old school talk show host worth listening to
Him keeping the wings is too hysterical.
Eric André wishes he could achieve this level of unhinged
By far BEST episode EVER!!!! LOVE!!
Wow dude, I don't think I've ever seen anyone go as hard as Conan did. Mad props!
HE'S IMMUNE
The Greatest please come back for ano4her epidose
Now we need nardwuar, we have to get him
It is for some reason somewhat rare to be laughing out verbally when you are alone. But that's what I did through much of this masterclass. Thank you First We Feast! Thank you Mr. O'Brien!!
Oh my god there were many moments where I'm just like "conan noooo!!!!"  He's an absolute beast but you know he's gonna be suffering for a week after that.
Toasting to the greatest funny man I have ever seen. 😂
This is gonna be a tough act to follow.
I didn't realize how much I missed Conan making me laugh.
A masterclass in Conanisms
Holy smokes. Epic! Conan is a grandmaster
Came back just watch it again and it’s still funny
I decided to comment before I could watch this episode, because I know for sure that this will be the best Feast the world can expect. Kedakai!.. As God Made Her!
0 to 100 😂 Conan 👍🏽❤️
This is funny
Legendary  best ever
Best episode ever. ❤
Conan is one of the best people alive!!!
god tier episode
Amazing and Hilarious
This is the very best performance on Hot Ones ever.  Conan has often talked about dying for a laugh, but I didn't really believe it until I watched this!  I believe he would staple his thigh to a cannon ball if he thought it would get a chuckle.
gfz h fzgh fgzh fg hf
Conan was born to be an entertainer, very few people in the world are as natural as him in front of an audience.
The best episode. Its not even close.
MISTAKE  😂😂😂  Conan LFG!
Sir Conan O'Brien 🏆 Hot Ones Champion Of The World 💯
fghfth
WHAT did I just watch?!
I'm glad Conan brought over his Nixon motorboating impression from his podcast to Hot Ones
LEGENDARY !!! Thumbs Up Conan 👍😂👍😂👍
LEGEND
Im actually concerned. Robin Williams vibes
Conan pocketing the wing 😭
jesus...Conan really does need help.
this has to be up there and the first ever best episode that has ever seen along with Gordon Ramsay, and that's just my opinion.
Best guest in a while!  Wing nine gave me Bill Murry from Little Shop of Horrors vibes!
Lisan-al-gaib!!
Absolutely amazing!!!
Straight King of hot wings
Wow that was unique
Ive never see such a good video. I love conan
I have never laughed so hard from a YouTube video.
Conan rubbing his nips with hot sauce is peak hot ones.
This was so unhinged. I love Conan.
That doctor bit was phenomenal
one word, Best Guest ever!
Legend
Broke the internet… my gawd
Ladies and gentlemen I present to you the greatest episode of all timme
The difference between this interview with Conan and the one with James Corden is so night and day.  Conan O’Brien still remains my favourite talk show host to this day
This may be the greatest episode of this ever
conan conan conan conan
He might hurt himself
"I didn't have a spice until 52", then he murders those wings.
Fantastic show! Great job, Sean. And, Conan O'Brien was incredible! ❤😂😂😂😂
Masterful.
I laughed so hard and for so long it started to hurt. Conan for king.
Best episode so far by miles
😂😂😂😂 yo this is a freaking CLASSIC!!! BEST EPISODE EVER!!
Love Conan! Miss him driving the desk around NY
GOAT
Conan turned this into a wrestling match and dominated as the Serial Killer Ranting character... Sean didn't even ask a Sona question.
I mean dame hes no ice spice but dame if that was not entertaining 😂
Conan is the best late night talk show host
Conan is a comedy genius. Slick af man ✌
My birthday is April 18 too!!!
This is why we love, Conan. 😹
Looks like Conan benefited from red-heads’ higher pain tolerances
Last dabbing before the last dab 😂 What a beast
None of those sauces are hot until you try magma.
1.7m views in only 12hrs and I'm not surprised. I've seen a ton of Hot Ones guests but this is the first time I've clicked so quickly on a video 😂
22:24 PURE PEPPER
Shut it down! It's never getting better than this! Congrats on the run, Sean!
DEAR LORD! What is he ON!?!?!
That might be the bsst episode ever
"Wise words from a wise and stable man"
Legendary
undisputed best, ever.
absolute late night king
Our Harvard king 🤴
GOAT!
Conan is the goat! Best guest on hot ones so far!
Wow that was absolutely legendary
Dr. Aroyo is the live action Dr. Nick from Simpsons
"You can't stop me from being who I am!" Ah, Conan . . . This was great!
Funniest Episode Ever!
GOAT LEGEND
Looove Conan I wish he would go on comedy tour. He needs to go in Joe Rogans podcast
This show always makes me want chicken wings...
Got some Chris Farley vibes when the rubbing part happened.
🐐🐐
I've never laughed out loud watching hot ones. I've smirked. I've smiled. I've even chuckled, but I've never laughed out loud. Not only did I laugh out loud watching Conan's incredible performance, I laughed myself to tears. What an absolute legend of a comedian. Thank you, Conan!
Conan. Now that’s a real G 😂😂😂😂😂  Must be the Catholicism 😂😂😂😂😂
They're still doing the COVID distancing lol so dumb
This is one of my favorite episodes! absolute chaos love it!!
EPIC! Instant Legend and GOAT.
Conan is perfect, always loved the guy, one of the best episodes since the beginning for sure !
The other guy? He still has beef with Leno that he wont mention his name? Lol
conan is crazy
Conan, please don't touch your eyes or anywhere 'down there' with those hands!
Conan the SPICEMASTER
This is the only late night show host I like
this was FANTASTIC
The only thing that could top his performance here would be the aftermath at home 😂😂😂
Conan O’Brien. Dolly Parton. Jack Black. The only Americans we all truly love and agree upon. ❤
Conan is savant who wants to be an idiot.
lol he eats like a five year old at dennys.
Best.👏🏼Episode.👏🏼Ever.👏🏼
Conan has always been a legend. Best show yet Sean.
That was good.
Conan is an absolute madman.  what a legend
Never clicked on an episode this fast-- Conan is the best, man
My favorite episode ever.
❤colan
Greatest guest of all time
The perfect guest! I knew he would be masochistic and overdo the sauce, for comedic effect. That’s Conan. He’s like Roger Rabbit, he can’t resist a joke, even if it involves self-harm 🤙
best episode ever!
This is going down one of the best Hot Ones interview because how much Conan has offer into the whole show, just love this man's way on making entertainment for real.
I'd like to see Sean match this guy XD
AHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHHAHA I CAN'T HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHA
"Was it a four year medical institute?" "It was supposed to be." walks away.  Comedy gold
CONAN IS THE BEST!
This was Legendary! Conan SLAYED this interview!
Not gonna lie, There have been guests who did the wings comfortably but none of them started with such bragging and yet outdid Sean while not losing a beat. Incredible ❤
Title should have been "Conan goes absolutely feral"
Conan seems to be well-informed about the show; I appreciate how he took a moment early on to pay a genuine compliment to Sean Evans' interviewer chops before he proceeded to clown harder than anyone has ever clowned before and totally take over the show. What a legend.
The hot sauce drinking made me scream
Best ep in a loooong time
This was MENTAL and everything that I have always loved about Conan. Gosh this was so freaking good.
Where do you think the sauce came from? Conan was the sauce all along.
I don’t even know how someone follows up this episode.
Conan is in the top 5 funniest people to ever exist
This was one of the greatest performances I've ever seen.
If you think for a second that this is all for show, you must not know much about him. Conan always goes hard! I love that his lips are straight up going numb, but he's still going! 😂😂😂 I am not at all surprised by him giving Sean props for being a great host, he's a genuine guy and always looks to uplift others. ❤
How this guy was ever popular I will never know.
Conan is the best hands down!!!
Leave it to Conan to finesse the line of absurdity with such grace. If I had stitches, I wouldn't anymore.
No one could possibly top this. Conan commits harder than anyone.
Amazing episode ❤🎉
this is the best episode period
I freaking love Conan! Also I did not know braggadocious was a real word 😅
This episode goes in the hall of fame
This is insane!
🌟Conan!🌟   Late Night #1!   ⭐Great Hot Ones!⭐
😳
Coked up Conan is the best Conan ❄
I never thought Coolio would be matched or outdone ever let alone by Conan O'Brian 10/10
FINALLLLYYYY
Bruh. That was legit gross. Funny, but also 🤢
Wouldn't have guessed that level of insanity. Sean looked terrified there for a moment.
I, have to ask. Was Conan... Actually on something?
I found out I'm being evicted and only have a week to find a place, but this episode made me laugh so hard I forgot about all that. For a while, at least. Thank you, Conan. Thank you, Sean. Thank you, Hot Ones.
"What is Conan doing???" He's believing in himself, he's becoming one with the spice
I knew this was gonna be good but I was not prepared for how it transpired 😂😂😂😂
Am I the only one who didn’t know Hot Ones was part of Buzzfeed?
this is hillarious episode
Candidate for GOAT Hot Ones. I only dream there is a BTS crew that follows Conan around for the next 1-2 weeks 🔥💩
This was insanely unhinged and I loved every moment.
Conan is the goat of late night. Facts.
It would take Conan to make me feel extremely uncomfortable watching hot wings. I love him ❤😂❤😂
Best episode ever!!!
He’s perfection. So funny 😂
Best. One. Ever.
Conan goat
Conan is an absolute machine! Love you sir.
Conan deserves an Emmy for this.
Conan absolutely delivered on this season finale!
legend. what a legend.
The bar has been raised...outstanding
This would have been next level if Jordan came along with Conan, I wanna know jordans opinion n spices.
The best episode of this show ever, and doubt will ever be topped. Conan is the GOAT
Had to do my 1st youtube comment on this one...this is the best episode of Hot Ones hands down...Conan is just a comedy genius...
He must have been so buzzed from all that sauce. He's such a wild man. 😂😂😂
He’s a legend 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Best Hot Ones ever!
One of the very best episodes ❤😂😊
Conan best episode ever
After the lame Ice Spice episode,  this definitely made up for it
"Tommy want wingie."
Legend
Now I see why he brought a doctor what a legend 👏🏽 best episode thus far!
Conan is so good he's beyond a mic drop. Best late night host ever. 🥰
Best episode so far.
King conan 🫡
It seems Sean was starstrucked with Conan.. Conan really changed everything ito something funny. THIS WILL BE THE TOP EPISODE for this season.
Clicked immediately 😂
Getting some serious Rick Sanchez vibes at the end. Absolutely brilliant performance. 10/10.
Brah just took it down like a champ 👍🏼👍🏼
Funny
It’s interesting how so many of the top comments loved this episode. One of the things I like most about this show is that it allows the celebrity to put their guard down and be themselves. Conan is 100% in character on this episode and while that’s a lot of fun to watch, and it had me grinning the whole time, I’d like to see a different side of him.
Sean should do a video of what he was thinking through this interview.
Conan poured candle wax in his mouth before shooting.
😂 that was the best
Da Best!!
Legend.
lol the doctor was pretty funny
This is so great! 😂😂❤❤❤
A wild Conando attacks  Edit. He’s putting wings in his pocket.
Conan has set the new standard! ❤❤❤
best episode ever!!!!!
This is just EPIC!!! What a TITAN!!!! Standing ovation for this man… he just delivered a master class for the ages!!
legend, no one has done it better
Conan, you're the goat
i am SCREAMING at this episode! hahahaha
I didnt expect the last 10 minutes fo be a rick and morty Hot Ones interview
Did he refer to Jay Leno as "the other guy"?
I've heard debate about the best episode ever. But I don't think there will be anymore debate. This entire episode was the insane. He never let anything he ever said, not have a joke attached to it.
16:56 Please be a meme
By far, the most unhinged episode. Amazing.
Perfect guest, what a doll ❤
‘Conan drops trou’ is the title of the buffalo dropping him
Bea Arthur …..outstanding
That was intense 😅
I mean he is hades so heat is nothing
Best season finale
The look on Sean’s face when Conan was bathing hls wing on the final dab!!
He could have died...
I was here.
Been watching Conan since the beginning.. dude still kills it 😂
I bet Conan's mom has been through it with him😂😂😂😂
instantly iconic. goat o'brien.
I am actually scared! 😱
first, I mean 19,639th
Can't stop laughing
This was not only a great interview, it was a master class in comedy. Conan is an absolute genius and one of the GOATS
I haven't watched this in like 5 years or so. glad I chose to watch this.
the GOAT!
Absolutely unhinged 😂😭
Conan is the King
he closed this season off properly. he was not a guest but a host. holy conan
his wife must be so lucky LOL
:O
The wings so hot it morphed him into Bryan Cranston.
One of the best episodes !!
This was the best episode ever. No one will beat it.
this is peak Hot Ones
This is the perfect example of : You do so many side quests in game  that when you arrive at the main story quest;  you just one shot everything including the final boss.   Conan the jester king.
I was so nervous Conan would touch his eyes 😮
My favorite Hot Ones episode of all time. Conan is the king of comedy!
This is probably the best Hot Ones episode ever haha
Conan’s doctor showed up than i’m gone 🤣🤣🤣
Sean proved himself again as an interviewer by knowing how to get out of the way of genius. He kept serving questions up and then leaving space for Conan to go Conan. Best interview yet.
This is the official polar opposite of Khaled's episode.  The timeline is complete.
Gross. Funny, but gross.
An absolute pro.  There are few like him :)
Respect. This man is the boss. Was an anti doping test performed after shooting the show?
CONAN IS THE GOAT AND MADE THIS EPISODE THE GOAT 🐐
The King ladies and gentlemen. Conan is the King. Tore away the script and rode a Segway through a  mental hospital whilst live-streaming. ❤😂😂😂
This was Conan's show, and Sean was just part of it.
Conan understood the assignment of season finale and just gave one of the best interviews and episodes of the entire series, what a legend 🔥🔥🔥
This is easily my favorite episode ever. Conan is a national treasure
Conan understood the assignment of season finale and just gave one of the best interviews and episodes of the entire series, what a legend 👏🏼👏🏼
I was so anxious to see Conan with Da Bomb!! Impressive! 🙇‍♀️ my new favorite episode !!!! Great interview, valuable responses.. I just loved it
This was a textbook example of a redhead's increased pain tolerance. Incredible!
i'm so sorry for the people who thinks that conan ate the actual sauces of the show. it's obviously scripted and at the studio they gave him something else. probably ketchup with barbecue sauce. even the consistensy of the sauces looked different from other guests. americans invented the TV and they are oblivious of how it works... shame
It’s him
Crazy to consider how old he is and still doing things like this
💀💀 conan covered in a lake of sweat after his bit with da bomb "im barely feeling it" 😂😂
Yooooo Conan went crazy for this episode Finale! What a great dude XD
Yes yes yeeeeeeeeeeees!!!!!!
He drank the hottest hot sauce out of the bottle and also added sauce to each one. He just dominated every other person has been on the show and made it look easy, and was able to keep getting funnier.
God level performance.
I love him so much. Meeting him was incredible!!!
best show yet!
One of the best guests in recent History. Conan Just Always brilliant.
Goes down as an all time guest🔥🔥
Immediately Sean's favorite.
Thank you for this.   Just....  Thank You
The improv Conan did here is actually so incredible. Amazing talent
A true showman, master of the craft
Sorry Gordon and Aubrey, I got a new #1 Hot Ones episode!  Drinking hot sauces, let alone Da Bomb?!?  LEGEND
I adore him. I will love Conan FOREVER.
Masterful, hits all the notes.
Legend for decades!!!!
Conan needs to come back with Jordan for a Part II. THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN
Best. Guest. Ever.  DJ Khaled need not apply.
hes f----ing AMAZING
Conan is the undisputed champion of the WORLD ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
BEST EPISODE EVER.
Wild!😂 we share the same birthday! He'll be 61, I'll be 37. Never knew that, so cool.
bro did conan win hot ones?
IMMORTALIZED THIS EPISODE!!!
Not many people can up stage Shawn, Conan O'Brien can and he did.
In-freaking-credible! Another interview for the ages! Maybe the best one yet. Wasn't expecting Conan to run the hot sauce hustle on us, the madman! What an absolute savage! And you can tell he was being absolutely honest telling Sean what a great interviewer he is, Sean is the anchor that we can depend on and it's guests like Conan that keep us guessing whether the next one will be the best yet again.
I was waiting for him to close with "this interview isnt going well"...
Having Connan was the best episode ever for me to watch on this show.. thank you so much hot ones!
Conan never dissapoints ... for now ❤
Conan is such a goat. Always my favorite late night.
Conan O’ Brien is a living legend and is hands down the best host in the modern era
i find it hard to believe that was actually the real hot sauce lol
Conan broke the show. 🥹
Ive never seen Conan get redder than red...
“You don’t have to talk to him, just to me” 😂 This man is a gem 😆
Best episode ever
🐐 stuff
I thought to myself “I’m going to watch whatever the first thing pops up on the YouTube feed” and lo and behold here is what we have
This was amazing.... Think he might have just beat out Gordon Ramsey on one of the best episodes ever. 😂
A true hot ones goat! 🐐Conan understood the assignment!
what a douc talking do to his doc like that as if he's a butler
This is the most absolute best one yet!! Conan is a genius! He made me look at life with a whole new aspect.  Just amazing!
I don’t know how many times I said “oh no!” 😂 I freaking love Conan!
Konan is legit
Might be the best episode ever!
Goat
Amazing
♥
Whoo!! I've never felt so alive!! 😅Hahaa this is epic
The most craziest, funniest, legendary, icon and most impressive......!!!!
Always count on Conan to crush the ball out of the park. Respect 🫡
7:40 *Doctor checks for pulse* Yea it's there
Absolutely HYSTERICAL
🎉🎉🎉🎉 finally
I haven't watched it yet but this is my favorite
Man; Respect!
I've done promos for Conan many times and I can attest to the fact he goes all in. There is no point at which he is not 110%. Brilliant.
Why in 2024 are guest still two tables away? Can we not revery back to normal?
Again I hope at some point you get Nardwuar as a guest.
Da Bomb slowly dripping out of the bottle while Conan has his final words, just EPIC! :D
Conan O'Brien, although renowned comic and late night legend, is still one of the most underrated comedians. That says a lot.  By far the best episode of Hot Ones I've ever seen. What a fucken ride!!!
He’s the king!🎉😅
Truly unhinged lol
Welp, The bar has been officially raised with this one.
ykno seeing that end makes me think that that 'fake doctor' actually is fully legit and very well paid, but they're doing a great bit. why am i so convinced? You REALLY think someone that rich and old would NOT do this without medical backup to se safe?   (sidenote: i also expect his agent/producer demanding it and him HATING it at first, till he came up with the bit)
Conan epitomized his own story of his commitment to the bit. He hopped on that water buffalo again in the form of hot wings. He didn't have to prove a point, he just committed to delivering to the audience.
I love how he said show business is you’re getting the greatest show in the world.
F'ing red heads are crazy. 🤪
Absolute epicness!!!!😅
oh wow
This was a very enjoyable video to watch on my lunch break. 😂🎉
Wow
Yes, indeed. The buffalo incident is real, it's on YouTube. And yes, Conan is milk white, like playing a CoD game and getting full-on flashbang'd.
Conan the absolute legend.  Some people are just built different and he's one of them, he's just on a whole another level of great. Never laughed so much in a hot ones episode, loved every second of it.
Conan is a legend. lol Kind of started turning into Rick Sanchez a bit at the end there, but absolutely incredible!
Conan commits to everything he does, always has, always will. Best. Comedian. Ever. By far.
How did Conan not break character, absolutely next level genius. Amazing job Sean and team!
You have to up the heat after this. Conan called hot ones bluff
He's the boss. That's it.
instant classic
CONAN IS A MFN BARBARIAN. my jaw literally dropped a cpl of times this episode
BEST episode that I've seen so far! Well done on both sides👍🏽
he wins
I was just cackling through the whole video.  I love this man.
I must admit this made me teary eyed laughing all throughout (without the spice)!
😆
I can't remember a better episode. The new King has been crowned!
What the heck, of all episodes. This one made me laughed hard the most 😂😂
I have never been more turned on by Conan than I am at this exact moment!! 🥵🥵HAIL TO THE KING!! 👑 👑
what a legend
FINALLY YOU GUYS GOT CONAN
Why is Conan acting like the rent due??? Somebody stop em😂😂😂
Dr. Can you check my pulse??  Yep, it’s there 💀
I bet this is going to spawn the Conan Challenge on social media
they say redheads have the highest pain tolerance... this is very fitting
ive never laughed so much and enjoyed an episode/ paid as much attention to it as this one. 😂😂
Legend.
Conan always out of pocket. 😂
i love him so much
I don’t know if I’ve laughed so hard and so consistently at something since at least 2019
“Was it a four-year medical school?”  “It was supposed to be……” 🤣🤣🤣
End the show. There is nothing after this. It's over. It was sincerely too good.
Conan the spice lord. aka. Lisan Al-Gaib
This video is full of meme gifs
this is the greatest episode I have seen, LONG LIVE THE KING OF LATE NIGHT: CONAN!
He decided he would be the best guest in history and he made sure that no one would ever top him. He knew exactly what he was doing 😂
TAME IMPALA REFERENCE  SEAN YOU BETTER SEE THIS
best ep ever, he needs to come back
Best episode evvvvvver
This was the best show ever 😂😂
Best, most unhinged episode ever. I've been lucky enough to meet Conan a few times and those experiences are some of my favorite memories. He even gave me a hug, kissed me on the cheek, and joked around with me and my friends for awhile :) Great season finale!!!!
Conan O'Brien = LIVING LEGEND.
Brilliant episode 👏 👌
Best Hot Ones episode!!!🤣😂
Wow this is one of the best interviews overall. Definitely the best job at taking on the wings I’ve seen! Also, I’ve never seen Sean laugh so much 😂
So thrilled for his new travel show!  We share a birthday & I am so excited it’s being released on that day!  I will be 50 this year 🎉 🧘🏻‍♀️♈️  So fun! Love Conan 💕🪺🌙
The best. What a man.
Rick James knows what's going on here.
Conan is one of the worlds greatest lunatics 😂
This is the absolute best episode you have ever had
Conan knows how to live.
Wing Drop MotherF***ers! 🤘🏻
S-tier
Coming in clutch with Conan. Best episode ever😂 Him coming unhinged at the end had me in tears
This is absolutely delightful!
To me, Conan actually is the GOAT talkshow host!
Saying Max wanted episodes seems like his old drummer became his warner bros boss
This is the best one yet. No one will top this!
oy gevalt.  i'm exhausted.
This is awesome. Love that Conan is here.
@23:00 is me when I’m having a mental breakdown 😂
This is the best episode of this series ever!
theres no universe where conan doesnt go to the hospital after this.
WHAT. AN. EPISODE!!!!!
Its not a bit!!!!!
Most unhinged episode ever. Conan are man on the mission to killing his taste buds.
the pocket of the wings is gold lol
I love Conan so much. He is probably the most naturally funny person of the last 20 years.
Conan is the best guest you've had
Coco!! 🤩🤩
love conan forever!!!!!!!!!!!
No offense to Conan but I really thought this would be a boring episode, but this might be my favorite episode now.
That was incredible. Unmatched charisma, professionalism, and uh.. composure.
Always been a fan of Conan and his work. Seeing him cruise through these wings was both shocking and funny.
Hilarious, genius, but probably ruined the show. No one is ever going to top this, but too many will try.
This was absolute gold! Conan is a true Hot Ones Legend.
I am so happy conan is finally on here! He's his chaotic self and absolutely dominated the sauces!
Conan was your best guest, loved this episode.
THE GOAT!
This Has to be THE BEST episode of all time. Looking forward to what is to come next season.
This was amazing!
I’m glad Conan agrees…. Why the Fzuuuuk did HBO change their name to “Max?”
Legend
This has got to be the best hot ones interview I've seen. This was incredible. Kudos to Sean and Conan.
I’m out of breath laughing so hard. Conan is the best
16:53 Sean :oh my gosh ….*Conan absolutely loosing it …. OH MAH GOSH
The moment Conan put that first wing in his pocket you knew it was about to be a wild ride.
i can't believe i almost teared up at the end where conan is giving me inspiring words with slobber on his face
Hot ones Goat right there lol
Awesome interview. Now bring Bill Hader 😎 x
conan is amazing, just amazing
Hands down best episode ever
"you cant predict the future" says former simpson writer.
A new bar set for season finale by Conan. Good luck topping that next season
Conan is truly one of a kind..
Such a great interview, love how open, honest and engaging Conan was but absolutely HATED all the "bits".
Best hot ones guest ever!
I am now going to be watching Conan O'Brien Must Go solely because of this interview. Respect.
Conan came off as more unhinged than ERIC ANDRE and I love it
best hot ones ever 😁
He meh, I found him a bit annoying 🤨
This is tremendous comedy.  I haven't laughed that hard in a while.
CONAN IS MAD XD
Love Conan! Would be hard to find a better guest
I’m disappointed Conan didn’t dab hot sauce on his neck like cologne.
Greatest interview ever. Number one hall of fame interview.
Conan is legend id wait for leno to be over just to watch him..first time i saw slipknot was his show.
Holy cow that was Wild love it
This was the best Interview of Conan O'Brien hands down
Insane! 😮Conan… best episode ever
Not even 2 mins into the video Sean's already laughing. Conan true comedian he's got bits everywhere he goes
He didn't see a spice until he was 52, so he didn't develop the receptors for it. Thats how he got thru this.
This was great, specially without Sona laughing at everything without adding anything
fantástic
Epic
Whats with the stock music ?
The GOAT!!!
Wonder if Conan still alive XD ahahahah
this is the way to do it... mind over matter.
This is the most I've laughed in a good while. Conan is awesome!
Best episode yet
22:37 The absolute look of fear and intimidation in Seans eyes is incredible, as if he was witnessing a god among us simply chugging his mortal sauces.
Ok.... Best guest EVER!!!
😂👏👏
I like Conan... and he just embarrassed every ♈️ alive and dead and to come. I feel like I deserve to see him on the toilet now. This is totally unfair 😮‍💨.
YES YES YES YES
This is challenging Bobby Lee for most chaotic episode
Best evaaa!
THE NEW G.O.A.T.!!!
That was wild. Im exhausted. lol
Where is Sean’s suede jacket from?
This is the complete opposite of the Paul Rudd episode. That had such a hilarious serenity to it……this is pure chaos incarnate, I love it
Best one yet and I've pretty much everyone. Killer!
Best..hot ones..ever!!
What a legend!!! Conan is insane! 🤣 What a epic Episode!
Dj Khaled could never.
Man I love this, watching two interviewers at top form work together to weave a fine silk tapestry. The way they lead and take clues from each other instantly is so cool. The machinations behind the illusion are so refined.
Sean usually matches the guests sausing of the wings. Not today.
THIS WAS THE HOT ONES BEST! I mean the show is great always some guests duds at best, but between the (obviously comedian) Dr and Conan I was in tears non-stop at the berserk antics. Coco4Life
When he started opening the sauces I thought: “Wow. That’s Shia LaBeouf-level stuff.” I’d say Conan went harder into these than anyone, except maybe Steve-O. Crying laughing. Such a legend. I love his type of humor and his show is gonna be hilarious if it’s anything like the times he went to Italy with Jordan Schlansky 😂
Absolute legend.
I honestly don't think I've ever seen Conan this unleashed. I also don't think that's a real doctor.
eyyy conan.
Oh. My. God. I am in shock !! Such an amazing episode .. I’m speechless.
BEST!
Best Hot Ones so far for sure
Fuggin MAD man! Hahahahahahaha Long live Conan!
Mornid comedy moment:  I imagine we read about CO’s demise the next morning
He’s really not that funny
Okay, no more spice for Conan. Hahahaha. 😅
I tried da bomb before. It ain’t no joke 😂 mad respect to Conan
Conan is such a king of chaos
Conan is simply the greatest of all time, he's just the greatest, not much that i can say
This man is cut from a different cloth. An American gem.
Conan we love you man. Thank you !
I hope Conan doesn’t get sick eating some many different hot sauces
i kept yelling from my couch please conan dont do it , conan is a maniac!!!!!!
There is a reason why I have cocos face in my room framed ❤ he’s A LEGEND
This is the best one yet
I am going to buy MAX just to see Conan. This plug plugged.
I hope Conan doesn’t get sick eating some many different hot sauces
Sean must've told him to step up his character a bit after the dull interview with Ice Spice.
This was absolutely disgusting. I couldn’t keep watching. He’s trying so hard to stay relevant and it’s embarrassing.
Conan... The GOAT "in the year 2000" and beyond
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥💥💥☄️☄️☄️☄️☄️☄️☄️☄️☄️☄️
This man is WILD AF and always will be... ILHSM
Conan's got the arrogance of Bill Gates.
There's no way he didn't go to the hospital to get his stomach pumped after that, the exit is not going to be BONITA.
Dude….   Solid!
2 minutes 30s in and he's brought his "Doctor" on and put a wing in his pocket ... STRAP IN FOLKIS
@8:10 now I wish I could go back and find names of those particular famous guests
the last 3 wings were LEGENDARY
My man ❤since 1991
Andy -Don't get on that 😁
What a performance 😂
one of the best episods ever <3
I know that gotta hurt. Great show
Gee, that was a show! Alcohol is the perfect solvent for capsacin. Maybe he had a few drinks before the show. Anyhoo, he handled Da Bomb extremely well. I had a lot of fun. Thank you. 😂😂😂
this is literally the best episode of hot ones i’ve ever watched
Wow that was great
Can't remember the last time I laugh so hard watching Hot Ones. One of the best If not the best episode so far.
Nothing can top this. Whoa. ❤️‍🔥
This episode is exactly as I would've expected it
I love that he put his left over chicken bones in his pocket 😂
Finally got Conan! What an amazing energetic interview. Conan and Craig Ferguson are my two favorite talk show hosts. I would love to see Craig on the show one of these days.
Wao he destroyed the wings buffalo 🐃 wings 🪽 😋
How tf did Conan eat that much hot sauce??!! I was screaming every time he did it
I will definitely be watching Conan must go, glad I saw this because I haven't checked to see what's new on max since season 2 of Our Flag Means Death "dropped".
What a legend
Spicy Tips 20:56
conan is king
Conan is the goat ❤
Where's Sona?
Conan is the absolute GOAT
This is one of the episodes I wish was done LIVE w/ chat.  I'd imagine it'll have 250k+ viewers, and everyone is going hysterical on Conan's insane antics! What a f*cking legend!
This is the best episode I've ever seen....
Saying to Bea Arthur, "4yrs tops" 😂
I knew he’d be a good episode but I didn’t expect he’d have the best episode in Hot Ones history. He’s the goat
Conan is a legend
I thoroughly enjoyed this
I have watched almost all of these. This is definitely a top 5 for sure. Salute!
A heroic dose of mushrooms in human form. What a fierce and unrelenting soul.
Best one yet! Living on the edge.
"BALD GUY STARING AT YOU MEME" every single mother fluffer here watching the end of the video am i right? "BALD GUY STARING AT YOU MEME"
Yeah….Conan won. All of it.
“I haven’t tried spice until my 50’s” POURS THEN IN HIS MOUTH FUJIN RESPECT
The best guest ever
INCREDIBLE
This might be the best episode ever. Conan is a rockstar. <3
Soooo he didn’t get the actual hot sauce💁🏼‍♂️
Best episode. Retire the show til Conan retires
Conans heart rate was roughly 230 bpm in this video on average
Absolutely the best episode I’ve seen. Conan and Sean are incredible hosts and had some great chemistry here!
Conan is an animal!! I honestly don’t understand how he survived this 😂
Conan is the mf'ing goat. Still relevant, still the king.
Sean got the Conan O'Brien clearance.
My body hurts from laughing so hard. Conan is a real one.
There is only one man who can participate in a normal Hot Ones interview and completely change the show in between questions and that man is Conan. Between Dr. Arroyo, the wings in the pocket, drinking the sauce, all the funny quips, its just a perfect episode, and a one of a kind episode
Conan destroyed those sauces like nothing. All while keeping his "cool" 😆 Man is a true professional hype artist with his unique scream-o comedy style
Sean really does ask THE BEST questions of any interviewer! I am a religious listener of Conan's podcast and you asked him all the questions I have always wanted to hear!!!
That was the most absurd, fantastic episode of any show on any platform in years!
Bro that second burn is going to be VICIOUS 😂
Best interview EVER
Best episode tbh
Conan took us all on a ride like Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet.
A true champion of the entertainment business.
Pretty sure Conan put wax on his tongue.
“You just feel for the pulse”  “It’s there”
Is Conan alive it's been 13 hrs
Conan is amazing. He just knows how to help carry the episode and make it even greater.
What an animal
Truly Iconic.
Conan is the absolute best!
Conan is forever that jam
🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾
Max blows
Conan makes everyone better, not that he's bad, he just amplifies everyone around him. He builds them up and makes them better. He can be so uncomfortable that he makes everyone comfortable. 😂
I love Conan so much🥹🥹🥹
They should just pull the plug on the show after this episode. Only down from here. This will NEVER be topped!
top 3 best episode ever? gotta be.
W
Conan is still the same lunatic he was when I first started watching him. 😂😂😂
18:40 "I am what I am" 💯
Conan is a F maniac....and that's why I love him🤣🤣🤣🤣
this is the funniest hot ones in a while. i'm crying from laughing! Excellent choice for the end of season guest!!! Keep it going please!!!
going to be a hole burnt into the bottom of Conans toilet after that
I literally thought Conan was going to be the worst with spicy wings. Boy, I couldn't have been more wrong! NEVER judge a book by its cover. #1 episode for sure!!
Whoa. Of all the guests. Next level. Fantastic!
10/10
Conan has been and will always be one of the greatest comics alive. His self deprecating humor is always on point, relatable and universal. He’s one of a kind and underestimated, although always been the funniest.
conan is a gd legend. the best there is.
mat pat please
This entire episode is GOLD!!
One of the best YouTube videos ever
“I bet you live four more years tops!” F-ing genius lol hahaha
Conan has been the top of my wish list to do a Hot Ones interview for years. And finally, despite my probably unrealistic expectations, he exceeded them. I wasn't sure anything would ever top Gordon Ramsay or Paul Rudd, but this is absolutely the best episode ever.
Best.  Episode.  Ever.
this is the best episode of the show
Hahahaha leave it up to Conan to make this the funniest episode ever!! Wow I was laughing so hard at the countless hilarious bits in this! 😂😂🤣🤣
best guest ever!!
I almost had a heart attack watching. That was wild.
oh no, that poor old man
"Power over Spice is power over all" - Conan O'Brien
I feel like Conan's new travel series is the sequel to 'An Idiot Abroad' 😂😂
What a legend, and a relevant legend at that.
That's it you can't top this that's a rap he went to the edge and beyond we really need a 24 hour update on Conan is he still alive 😂 what an absolute legend probably the Greatest episode ever
I'm glad to see Conan get the love and appreciation he deserves! A true legend of comedy 😂👏
This is the manifestation of his crisis he's been going thru over losing his talk show
Oh my goodness, this had to be my absolute favorite. Conan is HYSTERICAL and brilliant. He surpassed the predictable. brought in heart and humor with a touch or two of insanity - I LOVED it! thank you. :D
*_The best late night host ever!!!!_*
Thanks for making conon cry because he stopped doing his showes
Is anyone else thinking if he was okay the next day?
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼one of the best ones.. on hot ones 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
What Conan has is called "spite". He ate these wings with the power of spite.
LOVE COCO!!!!!!!!!!! hes so unhinged!!! I LOVE IT!  his little doctor skit is great tooo
TEAM COCO FOR LIFE!!!!!!
I love Conan more than any of my family members! Hail to the King baby
Conan looking like a ai Elon musk lol
I don’t think I’ve ever laughed harder in my life
I was not expecting that AT ALL.
Conan’s eyes betray his suffering lol
HAHAHA 😂😂😂😂
this has to be the funniest episode I have ever watched!
*Love Conan*
I feel like Conan hasn't gotten what he deserves out of the industry.
Best episode of first we feast
Conan is the spice king
Scoot over Gordon Ramsey, Conan is coming for that top spot ... This is by far the absolute best show ever...🤣🤣🤣
Craziest Hot Wings show ever !!
This was the best 20 min I’ve ever had on YouTube 😂😂❤
Conan is the 👑
Unbelievable
Comments are bots
Sean is a really really good interviewer
Conan O’ Brien has set the bar beyond anyone’s capabilities!
Conan the conqueror
0:48 how it started,  24:56 how it ended
isnt that doctor one of team coco's? I feel like I've seen him in a skit before lol
The real OG Conan O'Brien
Better hope Conan isn't looking to do a take over. Man made an impressive walk on the wing line up.
Woo! Classic in the can!
these seasons are as small as the wings
I know he was fighting for his life on that toilet later 😂
This is one of the better episodes!!!!  Loved it.
Conan is the man!
laughed so much at the end, had to stop the video a couple of times.
Conan is the GOAT
Literally the most insane Hot Ones I’ve ever watched. lol
I’ve been watching Conan for a long time. My dad watched Conan when I was younger and now I watch some of his old remotes with my son. As much as Conan jokes about seeming relatable to younger audiences, his cross-generational appeal is truly unmatched. I will always watch anything he makes if not only to support a living legend.
The best episode I've seen, I was dying the entire time 😂 hats off to you Conan
CONAN O'BRIEN HAS BEATEN EVERYONE. NO ONE WILL TOP THIS EDITION OF HOT ONES. I NEARLY LAUGHED MY BRAINS OUT. 💯  New guests will try to top this...and (((FAIL.)))
Oh my god, it is Charlie Rose where you eat hot wings.
Definitely the greatest episode to date!
Wing 9.  No more needs to be said.
This is a Rick incarnate
I'm a longtime fan and still I got sucker-punched by this mad genius. He even pulled a Joker casting reel summoning both Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger's takes without even knowing. I hope he's fine after this involuntary suicide attempt.
Amazing.
@23:00 - me at work 5 minutes after clocking in
I honestly believe his personality and commitment to the bit actually shielded him from the heat 😂
Conor speaking Chinese was great.
Nobody can make me cry-laugh like Conan can 😂 I love this man so much
Someone's going to have a tummy ache later!
Hot Ones - guys sorry it's not my birthday so why did you have to jump the gun on an awesome gift like this? Thank you for making my b-day 3 months from today memorable.
this right here is my idol fr
Thank you Sean and Conan!  That was so much fun 🤩.  Have a good off season.
Dr Arroyo was top of his class at Hollywood Upstairs Medical College
Boston humor  👍👍👍👍
His put-on reminds me a lot of Robin Williams. I’m glad to see he’s doing well.
One of the most extreme and bizarre episodes. Conan always delivers.
Conan is the king. I love him with all my heart.
I have never seen Sean not follow what the guest does with the wings.
This was the best one so far! No doubt about it.
Oh. My. God.  😂😂😂😂
Dang, Conan is an animal. Amazing.
Best episode ever. Full stop.  🤣🤣🤣
Conan took it to 11. What a mad lad
Conan is the new undisputed GOAT
Why are we still doing the two tables?  Covid is over bro's
Best. Episode. EVER!   Señor O'Brien always makes me happy, and this made me extremely extra happy.  My head hurts from the laughter.  I might have even peed a bit.   Conan delivered as always!
Conan's a sport, you've got to give him props.
Look I love the program, but I really don’t know why Hot Ones would need to continue after this episode. Pack it up, we got guys.
this is, quite possibly, the best interview i've ever seen.
What a madman
Coco the king🗣️🗣️
Conan, druski and Theo Von together would be hilarious
Top Tier
I think someone just took the #1 spot on Brett bakers power rankings
I feel bad for whoever stars in the next episode...having to follow this perfection.  I think they should just retire the show. There's nowhere to go but downhill from here.
yeah. you need hotter sauces from here on sean.
one of the best guests of this show and still one of the greatest talk show hosts ever. I love Conan.
Can’t stand this guy..
Let’s be real these current late night hosts can never be as natural as Conan
Somebody needs to transcribe Conan's rant from when he starts with Da Bomb until the end of the interview.
Conans been a real one since before Harvard. BEST EPISODE YET, and thats saying something!
Well that escalated quickly!!
Between Dax Sheppard and Conan its a dead heat for clearing and going back for more.
Without a doubt the best one
Greatest guest of all time!
Honestly, this episode can't be topped.
I never understood why the wings they eat are so tiny and meatless.
Best one yet! Conan is a champ!
I mean, geez...it's all downhill from here, right? Conan will always be the best late night host (with Craig Ferguson as a close 2nd).
This is hands down my all time favorite episode of this channel. Thank you Conan O’Brien. 😂❤
1M views before 24h. Conan is a legend
OK Conan wins. The End. Thanks for the show but it doesn't get better than that!
🤴🏼
THIS WAS IT!
I've always liked Conan, but his bit here made me want him to feel pain. I couldn't wait for him to get to Da Bomb and then I wanted every hot sauce to hurt him. Why Conan? Why do you make fans who love you want to see you in pain? YOU DID THIS!
You know what, THIS is conan high
The Man, The Myth,The Legend. Conan is brilliant. Funniest episode I've seen.
That was actually crazy
OK, THIS ONE IS GOING DOWN AS EPIC..
The best one ever!
Love this show and have been watching Conan since I was a kid. No wonder I thought this was the best Hot Ones I’ve ever seen
Well that was over the top, at least he didn't try to drink the last dab.
OMFG... That was nothing short of incredible.
One of the best episodes and performances in terms of a guest OWNING the stage. Easily top 3 ever
Bruh that water buffalo story is crazy
Best episode ever.
Best episode yet
Best interview ever. ❤
This has to be the best eposide of the show
The show lowkey got offended by Conan so they laced one of the later wings with drugs. Bro said "I'm feeling some sensations"
Am here for the absolute anarchy of Conan. Spectacular!
my mind will never be the same after seeing this. WOOOOOWWWWW
Hands down the best episode yet
He just gets progressively redder 😭😭😭😭😭
The reason why none of the hot sauces seemed to faze Conan is because hes been dead inside for years 😂
My king ❤❤❤❤❤❤
The absolute only thing that could’ve made this episode better would’ve been a Jordan Schlansky cameo
I love all this extra content from Conan making the rounds, it is weird to see him on the other side of the interview though. Regardless, he's so thankful and kind to every interviewer at the end of the interview, it's gotta mean a lot coming from one of the best interviewers ever.
Greatest talkshow host ever...
I adore that he normally " echos the guest" and he realized early on ...nope. Absolutely nope 😂
I really want Conan's jacket
absolutely legendary episode
This is THE most incredible, unhinged episode. I love this. What a freaking ride.
Conan The🐐
….and this is why I’ve been a Conan fan since 1996
I’m having trouble reconciling what I just witnessed and the fact that I do not believe Conan to be the type of person to use prop bottles. How did he do this? I feel like I’d end up in the hospital. Are some people really this immune?
Complete animal.
I wonder why Sean quipped "I ask in good faith" before asking Conan if he's good around spicy food. He never quipped that with other guests.
Conan wins hot ones. Shut it down. We have a winner.
This had me in tears 😂😭 Conan is the best
Hilarious.
Top 3 episode ever. I mean I can't say much more
Team COCO !! \m/ !! Cheers !!
That was unreal.
this is so much better than I could have hoped for
Wow just wow. Well I had fun watching this channel, sad there's not going to be more episodes since there doesn't need to be after this.
That was incredible
Great bit setting up those fake bottles & bringing in his doctor😂😂. Genius
That was awesome to watch I enjoyed every minute of it🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂
Conan has to be greatest guest on the history of this show. This was the most enjoyable episode of the show by far.
should've dropped this literally 2 minutes after the Ice Spice release, just so we can see both ends of human spectrum from idiotic to supremely gifted.
i can't even tell if it's a bit or those really just didn't got into him 😅
Hunter S Thompson has passed the torch to Conan.
I knew this would be good, but this is the greatest episode of all time.
What on earth did I just watch 🤣. Conan is hilarious!!
Greatest episode since the Coolio one!
He must have taken a hot brutal dump after chugging that stuff!!!lol😊 Love it❤❤❤❤
Conan drinking the hot sauce is another level for Hot Ones! One of the best episodes!
Conan is a gem. He is my GOAT
Such a contrast from the slopporitos on Murderville!
Conan The Great
I will never get to watch this for the first time again and I’m sad about that. Truly amazing.
what a show Conan, got to give it to you. This finale' is pure comic and feast. A really wise man build thru experience!! :)
Conan absolutely tanked it. You can see the sheer pain in his eyes at the end. But he did it for the bit. Outrageous.
The wing in the pocket 😂😂
What a magnificent beast ❤
Ok Conan, I saw you handle that spice on Murderville 😂 Give yourself more credit!
This was one for the books. Conan is a class act, a rare mix smarts and slapstick humor.
So were those prop wings and prop sauces or did we just witness and Irish Miracle?
Awesome! Perhaps the show should have two comedians or late night hosts challenge each other and Sean is like the wing and hot sauce ref!
Never would have thought Conan would be able to tank the vast majority of the hot sauces
They foretold of the Anti-DJ Khaled. And I did not believe.
LOL
Conan finally did it… he one upped mgk’s craziness. Didn’t think it could be done but here we are
Dude is a F’n LEGEND 🙌🏼
This is truly one episode i will always remember!!!!😂
Epic!😂
legend top g
Best episode to date!
After seeing that you gotta get Ed Currie and Conan together for a pepper X showdown!
Props to bringing in Jose Arroyo for extra comedy. XD
Still making me laugh... cheers conan.
EPIC!!!!!🎉
Wow Conan looks m Horrendous hahagah
Legend hahaha
I am 44 years of age and have been a Conan fan since his very first appearance on Saturday Night Live to his talk show and beyond, have met him in person multiple times and never missed a laugh, his performance on this show had me on the floor laughing. I have done the challenge in my home on a live stream and could barely finish it, this dude poured extra on every freaking wing and drank some!!! Pure gold!!! Happy early birthday my friend and thank you for over 30 years of making myself and millions of others laugh on a nightly basis. Much love and respect.
Bro... he's going crazy just for the bit...i love this man
Conan is irish or "almost as passionate as a mexican"
Conan once again reaffirming his GOAT status
The most daring display of manliness and spice tolerance I have ever seen… Bravo Conan 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🫡
I’m impressed I got no words this is the best guest no one gonna top this guy
I remember laughing at Conan when I was in high school, staying up late to watch him on network tv with my dad. And tonight showed he’s still just as funny, if not more funny. What an absolute legend.
omfg Conan Is King, I've never laughed so hard at a hot ones
What an absolutely epic way to wrap up a season!! Bravo ❤
Cheese and Rice!
Conan O'Brien Red.... new medical diagnosis
i loved this, i think its my favorite episode ever. lol
At first I thought Conan was out of his element being the interviewee, He quickly took over.   And I loved it.   Now let's get Andy on there.
Da Bomb gets everyone 😂
April 18 is my son’s birthday
The greatest episode ever alongside the Dave Grohl episode for completely different reasons.
Best episode!
Greatest hot wings interview ever!! So entertaining.
God I would have killed to see Norm on this show
Sean somehow makes Conan look like he's got some pink to his cheeks and might not be as Irish as he claims 😂
The meta has shifted 😂
RIP Conan's @$$hole.
I was having the hardest day….thank you for this! Conan is the best!!!!😂😂😂
Go, Conan!! 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Unhinged best episode
My favorite tv host being interviewed by my favorite internet host. It’s finally happened. Incredible performance
Definitely one of the greatest interviews of all time. Its said that Conan is still waiting to feel the burn
Conan is a straight up BEAST!
Best Hot Ones EVER
Rubbing your nips with hot sauce while screaming is such a Conan power move to assert dominance. It's not Seans talkshow anymore, Conan took it.
Best late night host ever 💯🙌🏻
I know Conan was hurting the next day lol
Conan O'Brien did to "Hot Ones" what Tom Holland did to "Lip Sync Battle." It's just out of reach for every other guest now.
WOW,he nailed it.Spicy?Not effected at all😱😱😱Pure legend.
How did Sean manage to get Conan clearance?
When are we gonna see The Dawgs on here. We need The Dawgs.
This is what a season finale should look like.
Charlie Rose while eating Hot Wings!   Spot on!
Conan is a loose Cannon in this
i think that was, without a doubt, the best performance in hot ones history. i feel like he could go toe to toe with smokin ed, no joke. unless of course he coated his tongue with wax.....
Why do some people think that Conan O'Brien is funny?  He's just an idiot with bad hair.
The Conander in Chief strikes again.
The best episode ever! I can't see anyone topping that 😂😂😂
This is the best episode of all time.
I've watched every episode of Conan O'Brien's show. Watched from the beginning when commercials where about and waiting a week for the next episode to drop. I makes me feel old.
He must be possesed with something if he cant feel lol
I’m dead 😂😂😂😂 the best
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 im in tears 😭
First good guest of the season
Conan shouting about Chaucer with a hot sauce and snot covered face is sending me.
Conan... Love you... Great interview... But this joke was a dud. He replaced all the sauce/wings. I refuse to believe he just tanked every sauce like that.
Oh nope the milk did it
He should be a doctor
I absolutely adore Conan, hugw props to you Sean that he recognized your masterful interviewing skills.
Poor doctor he seems so nervous 😥
so conan won hot ones
F@ck yeah!!!!!  Conan just break the code.  Sean can go home now  Hahahahaha!  The best episode ever!
Can Conan be our next president?
Best episode ever! Lol 🔥💯🔥
He's seems to be the epitome of American 'comedy'. Loud and repeat until people laugh...
Guy is a genius lol!!!!     Conan was good too.
Conan.. you are fkin great!
We have a new king , his power levels are of the charts 🤣🤣🤣.
the jacket game here is BEYOND.  =)
Sean looks legitimately scared for Conan in this episode
Sean you’re great but it’s Conan’s show now
Sean got so scrambled, Conan carried it, I think this is my #1 episode now. And I’ve watched a ton. Conan, you’re the GOAT 🐐.
Okay this was my favorite hot ones. Conan is the goat!
That last piece of chicken holding on for dear life made the end so hard to watch 😂
I think this was just one big way to show Conan is testing positive for Covid haha
One of the two to best do it..I have to say, I loved this episode.
I need the "pockets and wings" talk I think.
Chaotic!!!!! Team Coco!
The red head is showing
BY FAR the best Hot Ones EVER!!!
I don't know if that was my favorite episode, but good lord I WAS ENTERTAINED!!!!!  ...and informed, dude is smrt.  Laughed so hard I snorted.
best episode ever
i dont know if this weakens or strengthens my suspicions that the "hot sauce" is just for show...
Ok, I think I've commented on less than 10 videos in my 40 year old life.  This one deserves a comment.  Conan was legendary here.  The red face.  The sweat.  The eyes at the end.  The sloppy face and hands.  Best episode.
Conan just casually asking permission to put the wings in his pocket made me laugh every time
Still the best host, current and past
What a legend😂
Conan will do anything for a laugh, and it works every single time.
When will u get Nicki or Rihanna on here? I demand Beyonce!
Did he go to the hospital after that?
All hail the new king.
Well done Sir Conan. Very well done. 🥰👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🫶🏼
Amazing show. Has Anyone noticed the lighting?
Unquestionably the best episode. I'm a huge fan of Hot Ones. I've watched since season 1. This is it. This is the best one. I could barely breathe I was laughing so hard.
I don't know why I thought Conan could be normal here. Lol   Take that DJ Khalid.
Epic
7:50 "check my pulse"  "it's there"  great doctor
I mean, this is obviously the best Hot Ones episode ever.
Wow best guest ever !! Conan’s a comedic genius
Dr.Arroyo was a fantastic add.
"You're not a doctor, are you?"  "I should be."
Absolutely. Without question, the best episode, i've ever watched of this show
Literally laughed/screamed/cried through this whole thing— there’s a reason Conan is the goat!!!!
First time I’ve seen Sean’s face react
Conan is the gold standard. A great human being.
Amazing. Happy Bday Conan! And we were gonna check out your new show anyway but NOW ...we are running on the 18th 😂😂😂 Epic episode.  I think im the only one who was looking for the string bean dance 😂😂😂
Subscribe to this channel
Conan ❤
I've never clicked on a video so fast
that's one wild Man
Did Conan go to the hospital?
Conan is such an icon. I have immense respect for him.
Nobody commits to a bit like Conan!  Over the top, completely insane, and hysterical!   Love you Conan!
guest of the year and its not even close
Conan the Barbarian. A true Spice Lord!
He needs a da bomb boss trophy good lord
Conan is the Best, i love him haha
This is fantastic
Now let’s see Leno top this.
Best one ever.
The stone cold facade of Conan is just incredible to watch
Conan is a legend. Jay would never sacrifice like this to make me laugh at 10:00 on a Thursday. I love you Conan. And thank you hot ones for this 🙏🏻
Best one yet.
This was Epic! It’s been a while since I have laughed this hard! Go Team Coco!!!
9:42 I expected a Jarod Miller story
Best guest ever. Thank you Conan!
Conan is just built different
We found it. THIS THE GREATEST HOT ONES EPISODE
Conan is a comedic treasure 🫡
OUTSTANDING!!!!
Conan was like me when I got 6 of their hot sauces and made wings with them. I mean it's hot but it's still perfectly manageable.
“I don’t fear your wings, man” Immediately regret 😂
Meh
Red heads are known for their spice tolerance
Love seeing Conan on any platform. Great guest.
This is the most unhinged episode I’ve ever seen. I thought I couldn’t love Conan anymore than I already do, but my God man. This was WILD.
rare to see a guy just dominate an interview like this
#1 Hot One’s contest to ever run the board! Conan the Destroyer!
Coco was my favorite and STILL is my favorite.  What a wildman.
My ears were ringing, just watching Conan! 😂
Make this man a Hot Ones all timer plaque and hire the doctor as a character on next season. His role was hilarious 😂
lol
Conan M-EFFIN O'Brien for the win !!! Best episode in forever.
Still using two tables I see.
Standing Ovation for Conan! Wow! 😂😂😂😂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
The way Shawn’s eyes lit up when he drank the sauce 😂
F*ck Texas
Before this started, I was thinking to myself “he’s going to make a mockery of this isn’t he? “
Best episode. Conan you're a treasure
How did you get Conan, Sean?  he is like your biggest (one of) guests so far.
The best part for Conan is he can still enjoy the wings he stored in his pockets after the interview.
Conan almost killed Sean lol. Sean are you ok???😂
Here for the comments for the legendary Conan
This episode is easily among my favorite of all time for the show! Right up there with Paul Rudd and David Blaine!
he killed it
When MatPat?
Wow, what a ride
Woah respect to Conan.
Honestly, no interview has been this good or will ever be this good again!!! How can an Irish Catholic boy from Boston handle so much heat??? Conan is CING. I cried laughing when he told the water buffalo story. It says all you need to know about Conan to the core. Love you, man. Love you both.
The ONLY way this could have been better is if Jordan Schlansky made a surprise visit.
Spectacular
He upped the ante on future last dabs
Man I just love this guy, genuinely the last of the great talk show hosts.
I thought the buffalo thing was total bullsh*t untill I googled it lol
Fake hot sauce.  There was no hot sauce in the bottles.
Best show yet
Conan is the man
This is officially my favorite episode of Hot Ones. I'm not sure if anyone can beat Conan O'Brien. This entire interview is fantastic.
No ones mentioning him pocketing the wings? Oh ok.
This is by far your best episode you’ve ever done !!
Really minor reaction to The Bomb!
This is absolute and pure mayhem and chaos. Amazing way to end the season.
This might be the most unhinged episode I've ever seen. Conan covered in spit and sauce and chicken telling us to read Chaucer. This show wasn't really a competition until this episode, and Conan is on top.
Conan is amazing!!! 😂
Best episode ever?
one of the few times sean didnt copy the guests....DRINK DA BOMB SEAN
I love you Conan!
this is the one i've been waiting for. team coco for life
yeah. This is pretty much how I imagined it would go. I thought he would take over or challenge the format. Can't complain about it, because he is actively hurting himself doing it. The bts is hilarious to imagine though.
Fkng legend!
BEST FREAKING GUEST EVER HAHAHAHA!!
This is #1, easily. Brilliant.
Sean met his match lol. I'm not sure I have never seen anyone hit it as hard as Conan. Lol
Two greats 😊
disgusting
How can someone be an absolute animal and a god at the same time?
That’s the best one ever.
❤dr Aroyo 😂
I know Sean was, how-you-say, "twitterpated" during the Shakira episode, but I can't believe he lied to her TWICE!!😂😂 He told her that "no one has ever quit" and that she "was the closing episode of the season." Now,her episode was GREAT, and she is amazing, but... THIS is a GD SEASON FINALE!!!!! I LOVE CONAN FOREVER!!!!!!!!
I could not stop laughing 😭 Nobody does it like Conan
Haven’t watched yet but this has the potential to be one of the greatest episodes ever
Conan: You can't stop me  *pulls bones from his pocket*  from being who I am.
Conan forever ! Team CoCo !
There used to be two kinds of Hot Ones guests: Humble and Cocky. With Humble, you would think, “Oh, no, I don’t want to see when they eat Da Bomb.” And Cocky, where you would think, “Oh, I can’t wait for Da Bomb to knock you down a few pegs!”  And then came Conan. Who after being cocky, made fans say after Da Bomb and the last two sauces, “DUDE, CONAN, NOOOOO!!!”
He is the best ❤❤❤😂😂😂
Conan is the greatest !
Master of disaster ! GOAT CONAN OBRIEN !
also lol they did something fishy with those sauces. cause Sean was tearing up this whole interview and Conan was chugging straight from bottles.
@19:38  Warren Harding was one of our worst Presidents.  And he died because his wife made him hire a doctor quite like Conan's, who misdiagnosed a heart attack for indigestion and caused Harding to die.
What a riot!!! 🤣
What a freaking beast. Lorde killed it silently, and Conan came and conquered boisterously
You have to invite Robert Smigel with Triumph the insult dog
THE GOAT
Conan o'Brien is an international treasure.
Conan is an S tier spicelord.
in highschool (2003 ish) this 14 yr old kid told me Conan was the best. I never really liked him but decided to give him a chance... Turns out Conan is the best. I love this man lol * edit Conan is fkn nuts! 20:55 22:58 24:14 best episode ever Conan is a wild man
THEE best episode ever!
One of the best ones yet. Conan is such an icon!
OK, so I got "Nixon" and "I'm Irish" and "Warren G Harding" stamped on my BINGO card.
Best ep ever
Savage Obrian
When Stallion Conan bolts from the prairie nobody can rein him in.
Can you please interview Zendaya!!
ARE WE DOING THIS OR NOT
This Episode was incredibly outstanding!!! Conan is a badass!!! Bravo!!!
Conan is a legend
As😂😂😂😂😂😂best episode ever
I’ve had the fortune to meet a handful of celebrities in my life, including Conan, but he was definitely one of the kindest, approachable and outright hilarious of them all.  The guy seems to have no ego about his status, and was just down to be playful and joke around with everyone
sweet jesus.....never again.
**PUT MATPAT ON HOT ONES ALREADY**
da king
I’ll have to check out those episodes.
I think Conan put candle wax in his mouth.
Conan had to coat his mouth with something
Mega LOL.  What a season ender!  Not sure you will top that one :)
Who ever thought Conan O’Brien would be the best guest on this channel. I thought Steve O would never be topped
Conan is a legend!
this is the first time in a long time where a plug actually does its job and convinces me to watch their show/ work. now i cant wait for april 18th 💀
I dont have HBO (Max) butim getting it just to watch this series. Brainwashing me to pay for something i dont need based only off your personality is how you're supposed to do interviews. This was gold. My chicken and rice dinner tasted better watching this
I thought Sydney Sweeney was tough but for F sake on Conan!!!!😅
Now compare Conan's performance with someone like DJ Khaled 😂😂
Took it like a champ!!
Conan- showing us all how to commit.
“Call the wife” had me dyinggggg
I'll give the show a try just because this was incredible.
You could tell that Conan was not going to go easy on him.  This was fantastic.
Do not drink hot sauce like that! I’ve done it. Puked everywhere.
Best one ever
Best episode ever...and I almost threw up during the last part, literally...Conan went above and beyond with the pain for comedy.
23:00 I want to have the same level of commitment while enduring pian like Conan
Best Epi ever...Thank You Sean
This is the greatest episode of all time!
conan drinking the hot sauce and putting wings in his pocket was funny and hes fine guys
Legend 🤣😂🤣
Epic episode.
Conan joins Coolio's, Paul Rudd, Chili Klaus and Shia LaBoufe's podium as the true Hot Ones, the Ones who drenched their wings without remorse.
Im FINE
I mean, what the f Conan!?!?!? Bwahahaha
Yo that was a wild ride. Conan morphed into Rick Sanchez and it was everything I needed right now.
This is the epitome of greatness
Best Hot Ones!! Been waiting for this👏👏
This is my favorite episode! Too good!!!
This was one of the best episodes ever
conan is the best!!!!
Can't top the goat
Corny, but brave!
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Am I the only one who doesn't find Conan funny in the least...?
FINALLY!!!!!!!
Wow where do you go from there?That's insane that was great
Why is no one talking about the pocket thing I am crying 🤣
Legendary
Amazing!!
What an absolute irish legend
Conan and his koolaid mustache 🤣 the best!
Season 23? 23? Are there VHS tapes of season 1?
Conan has 0 commitment issues
Best guest ever!
conan really is the goat
An absolute legend beloved by all and I’m so happy he keeps doing what he likes to give us more time with him
The bar has been raised...Conan did his homework...when's Martin Short coming on?
Oh my god this is by far the best Hot Ones episode ever made Conan is a legend
gawd that was hilarious
This is the best episode of Hot Ones of all time 😅
And of course, Conan did not dissapoint. Next get Obama here. Either one
I absolutely love that Conan brought along José Arroyo to play a character for this. 😂
The commitment is unparalleled in all of our history as a Hot Ones community.
Pure insanity
Always been a Team CoCo supporter. Been watching him since the year two thouuuuuusaaaaaand.
Instant classic
When you start feeling it in your stomach and seeing the walls wiggle: 18:13 😂
That wasn't a dab. THAT WASN'T A DAB!  Seriously though...even with makeup, that level of pain cannot be hidden.  Brilliant showman. Brilliant episode. Brilliant Season!
This has gotta be the greatest hot ones episode ever
yooooo its conan!!!!!!!!
Absolute Legend.
He is the best guest yet bahahahahaha
He is AMAZING
Looks like O'Brian really had fun with it. I mean, there was no way he could turn the bragadocious down when the wings started really kicking, so the only way to go on was to out-do the wings. I would say that those wings were "crazy" hot.
Great guest, great interview, great episode.
lol the way Dakota Johnson trounces Conans process of "if a guest says an interview isn't going well."
Did he say Slice Lords?
Anyone recognize the three stooges noise from when Conan went to the hood for soul food with one of his employees?
Conan O Brien is one of the greatest entertainers of all time. PERIOD.
Best episode yet!! 😂😂😂
Conan is da bomb
one of the greatest hot ones episodes!
legendary guest. legendary episode.
I see Conan i click
This must hurt more than the buffalo toss!!  The man will do ANYTHING for a bit 🙇🏽‍♂️🙇🏽‍♂️
Hahaha Conan clearly respects this show and went all out for their season finale.
Not even kidding, his speech about comedy was beautiful.
That's no doctor, it's the Bowl Owl! ❤
BEST EPISODE TO DATE!
I am here for Conan
best episode of all time contender
Conan's vibe and the epic, touching rant at the end of this for whatever gave me unhinged, Walter Huston vibes from Treasure of Sierra Madre 😆Loved this interview, Conan crushed it, frothing at the mouth with milk and spicy sauce slather.  If you go to Spain Conan, you have to finally go and visit Javier, claro que si!
This delivered on the hype.
Didn’t think I could love or respect Conan anymore than I already do. Wow, what a performance. Truly season finale worthy. King of late night 👑
This was the best best BEST guest EVER.
Undoubtedly best hot ones ever
COCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCOCO
The best episode by far... Conan commits to comedy like no one else when he's in the zone its actually magical to watch
Best episode 🤣
This was so good. I think it should be up there with Gordon Ramsay.
0% chance this doesn't spawn a field of memes and gifs.
What a show
YEAH ❤❤❤❤  Conan!.
Best part about this is we get the follow up on the pod because you know Sona and Matt have a few things to say lol
Easily the best Hot wings ever!!
He missed an opportunity for a Leno joke on the 2nd wing, but it's still the best episode yet.
Wildest Hot Ones EVER! 👏🏻
Congrats on being the first video this year to make me cry laughing. Definitely my new favorite Hot Ones. That was unhinged.
We MUST see the water buffalo footage!
Now I’m gonna watch him on Max 😂
" We're gonna put rockets on your feet! ITS GONNA BE FUN BAILEY! FUN! " This episode is an all time classic.
This needs more views
This is by far the greatest episode of Hot Ones.  The dude is showering his wing in Da Bomb sauce and still giving Sean a stitch in his side while simultaneously pulling off a great interview.
23:00 clip it and meme it. 😂
somehow exceeded all expectations, I love this show but I've never seen an episode that compares to this. Conan is a legend.
this made me laugh and cry at the same time
The best episode of all time, Conan fan forever!!!🎉🎉🎉
This has to make it to one of the top 5 if not 2 next to Ramsey
Ok, I’m as big a Conan fan as anyone, and also love Sean and this series, which is why I need to call it like I see it: There is NO WAY that Conan was using real hot sauce for any of this!  — I scrolled through lots of comments, expecting all the regular Hot Ones fans would be calling BS on this display - this “commitment to the bit.” Alas, am I the only one? (Or am I the only one obtuse enough to point out the obvious rudely - I hope not…)
Irish 🤝 Mexicans
I love Conan so much. The king of late night. Long may he reign!
Felt like Conan took this one over 😂
After Conan, everyone will be weak🤣🤣🤣 and Nixon did do Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In so there's that
Conan probably gets high off the hot sauce!!
what a savage
There’s a certain brilliance required to eat things that dominate your facilities while performing theatrics and articulating your points brilliantly. The fact that Conan doesn’t miss a beat despite the abject torture of the sauce shows that his mind is actually way beyond that of any reasonable human.
I expected Conan to be funny,  but I did _not_ expect it to be THIS GOOD!!!   TEAM COCO!
I think the Gordon Ramsey episode has finally been eclipsed... haven't laughed this hard in years 😂😂😂
My intestines have turned into ACID
Who else searched for the water buffalo video? 🙋‍♂️10:05 Conan brought Hot Ones to a level I didn’t know was possible. Great interview Sean!! 🔥 the zoom on the bottle 23:50 was magic 🪄.
Another title: Conan's 50+ year mental breakdown in 27 mins 😂
Incredible showman
Best episode by far LOL
Conan is the messiest eater on the show
11:07 Wow you can hear an emotional struggle in his voice and see it on his face here. Kind of comes off as feeling a but stuck and tortured with the pressure. Caught by surprise with this.
Oh my god he went full Chris Farley on #9.  I was falling over laughing the whole time!
I can’t keep liking everyone’s comment but I want to! Have I found my people?! I adore Conan since 1994 🖤
He's at John Hopkins right now. You can take that to the Bank.
This is the funniest and most intense hot ones of all time
I’ll have what he’s having
I think this was the funniest hot ones yet😂
Best Episode 😂😂😂
I'ma be real, going in I didn't think Conan was going to handle the sauces very well. But this is legitimately the hardest I've ever seen anyone go. The man's an animal!
Conan got high on the hot sauce!
Im freaking crying right now 😭
One of the OG and he made it so entertaining as he always is perfecto
DREAM COME TRUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Looking heavy Cranston on this one…
the.absolute.goat.
Here you dropped your crown: 👑
Conan's hair is still epic
HOF Hot Ones Episode! 🐐🔥
How have they never had him on before? Hahahahahahaha
This is the best episode yet   Conan is a goat.
We need the video of Conan and the water buffalo
Anyone knows conan's jacket?
Conan is the goat
The absolute goat
Great show! I've never laught so hard. Thank you for another season and incredible season finally.
Conan jumping on a water buffalo is insane
are you idiots still social distancing? Sit at the same table. Good god.
This is the most I’ve seen Sean interact and laugh! He’s done it before but this is the most I remember. Conan is ❤
Insane showmanship!
Funniest late night host ever
Weak
What a nuclear combination
He’s PERFECTLY F****ING FINE!!!
For awhile I wondered if they were going to take a run eating the last few wings and doing the interview during the run  Awesome work Sean for keeping up, Conan never change
Funniest episode ever
This is an amazing episode!!! Thank you for getting Conan! Chappelle soon?
He's the GOAT of late night humor, and his podcast is dope, give it a chance.
The best interview yet, eye-opening, hilarious, shocking and the final speech. No one will ever top this episode
Even Conan can't save this boring show.
That is a dope jacket with the red threads
14:00 😂😂😮😮😮
Might be the best one yet...
Warren G Harding saying he shouldn’t be President then dying on a train 💀💀💀 I was rolling
Conan should be on Mount Rushmore. Not of hot ones, but the actual mount.
This had me 🤣 rolling.
I’ve been a Conan fan all my life but I have never begged so hard for a guest on this show to for the love of god or whatever you hold sacred, please! Please wipe your face and chew with your mouth closed 🤣🤣🤣. This was the best episode since Bobby Lee. Oh Gawd! The Sauce all over his friggin face 🤣🤣🤣
13:44 😮😮 Conan the boss
I think Conan broke Hot Ones.
This is by far the best episode in ages 😂😂😂 Conan kills this and is a beast eating the wings of death
Conan is the man
My favorite episode
He is actually an amazing human being wow
Surprised he didn't ask for a straw.
Hand's down the magnificent episode with the GOAT.
Best episode ever
Conan owned hot ones! Absolutely heroic amount of da bomb on that wing. A pea sized drop can take your breath away.
Kudos!!! Absolutely rocked it! Loved Conan in the 90s in the UK... crazy that he's still going but this makes me want more of him.  The hair, though, WTFcakes...
That was the most entertaining thing I've ever seen oh my god
Conan took da bomb like it was nothing
My face hurts from laughing so hard
The best episode ever.
Wow! Conan is a true ma man!
Conan is a treasure and has to be included as one of the world wonders
Crazy!!! 🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️
I am crying and my gut literally hurts from laughing so much
This is something i've dream of seeing and i'm so happy it happened, Sean really deserves this, he's the best interviewer of this generation
Great episode!
ty sean and first we feast for having conan! hes a true legend and was lucky enough to see his show in california twice! team coco forever <3 amazing episode, its gonna be tough to top this one!
First good person to come on this season
Conan is the greatest.
Nothing less than a legend.
Congrats, Sean, Conan is a perfect quest!
I wish I could like this twice
This was amazing.
Would really love to see the outtakes from this!
"This is just a guy being on a show." 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"If there was a mic drop, I'd do one. But I'ma do a wing drop" LOL
Huge props to Conan for this. Man took it like a pro.
Conan still the best bruh
The best
Good luck to the next guest trying to top this living tornado of a person
I don’t think Conan thought about when it leaves his body😂😂😂
Best episode ever!! Love you COCO!
easily the best one yet
best show ever
Top 5, by far.
now THAT is a hot ones episode!!
Outstanding show, Conan! Outstanding show! You're a bonafide showman!
This prob best episode
Conan is wearing the suede jacket that Sean has on here in his next interview on CNN, I swear 😂
I’m cryyyyying. I love Conan so much and cannot wait for his show !!!
Ill definitely be tuning into Conans podcast to see how he feels after all this!
if he gets Craig Ferguson on here then he is officially one of the best interviewers
Conan always brings a show 🔥
Conan went full gene wilder here
Dude this is the best episode of all time
Kudos to Sean. Im not a Host, heck I'm not even good at conversation, but i agree 100% with Conan on Sean being a great host with or without the wings. Great episode. Congratulations Hot Ones Team!
It's 2024, and you're sticking with the social distancing tables. It's cringy.
I'm now picturing a random wardrobe trailer somewhere with a bunch of once bitten chicken wings just molding away in the pocket of that jacket.  Conan is on fire in this. Literally and figuratively. 🤣
Connan is a goat
He's a true entertainer. Bless him!! So unhinged
Gotta love Conan man there’s nobody like him
Best one I’ve watched yet!
This is the best Hot Ones, EVER!
ABSOLUTE CHAMPION CONAN HAS SINGLE-HANDEDLY OUTDONE EVERY GUEST ON THE SHOW YET WHAT A SEASON FINALE 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
This was literally the greatest episode to date
IRISH GOAT
If this isn't the Greatest Video on this channel , Please Don't Talk To Me.
Best episode ever.   My 7 year old son was crying in laughter.
Conan!!!
🐐 instant classic. Easily top 5
Oh my days. Conan once again proving why he is, was, and will always be the best. Not even paint stripping hot sauce can distract him!
Conan is the only guest I’ve seen that extreme suffering brings out the most philosophical epiphany in him 😂
Conan Is the goat. Best Hot Ones episode ever. I’m so happy for Sean too Conan gave him so much props
Best episode so far. I think its gonna be tough for hot ones to top this! Hopefully Conan is ok. He's gonna be feeling that for a few days.
CONAN DA GOAT
Cried laughing at his answer to the president question haha
This is the BEST episode ever hands down. Had me crying laughing 🤣 😂
Best hot ones !!!
Conan was incredible 👏 👏
Legend.
I didn’t realize how insane max sounds till Conan said it
Tim Dillon needs to do one of these
Wow
"You're not a doctor, are you?" "I should be."  Made me lol pretty good
You can end the show now.
Incredible 🎉😂
Conan is top tier.
Never really watched Conan before, my guy DRANK THE SAUCE, oh he on that real good yayo
That was brilliant and disgusting all at once. lol
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Did Conan lick the same stethoscope or do we think they changed it 😂
21:10
OH god what a madlad, salut Mr. O'Brien. What a legend
“What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I feel”😂😂😂 I was hoping he’d follow with a “I wannabe a reeeeal boy”
Lorde vs Conan Who would win
#1
For a guest to completely turn an episode upside down, in a good way, for a show that has been running for so many years, he must be a legend. And Conan is indeed the legend.
prime coco
Couldn't stop laughing 😂😂😂😂😂 what a genius
This is legendary, I love Conan! <3
No one will ever top this episode lol this is why we love Conan
Dousing his wing in even more Da Bomb was the worst possible idea ever
Conan O’Brien 1960-2024
So a dude from Boston was on the show...
funniest dude alive
The intro makes you think he's going to quit on the first wing!  In reality he's drinking the hot sauce!
EPIC episode! Years of chasing Conan to get him on, and he definitely made it worth it. Two Kings right there killing it. 😂💀😵‍💫 I wonder if Conan ate his pocket wings after the show? 🤔
Best episode ever, laughed so hard throughout the whole thing. All of his skin was probably burning afterwards and had to take a bath in milk
Hands down best episode, Conan delivered an amazing performance, Sean almost couldn’t keep up lol
Conan’s a legend hahaha
Greatest performance in the history of hot ones. Conan always a legend
My fave show on YouTube + my fave person in Hollywood = my fave video on the internet. Team CoCo forever!
This is in fact the moment in which Conan cemented himself as the greatest comedian that ever lived. With this he has reached the absolute peak of comedic madness. He walked the fine line to the summit with the precision and fearlessness of an absolute Terminator. That was equal parts incredible and insane. I am in awe.
Conan O'Brien is among the best entertainers of all time, in any category.  His Late Night show was my favorite to watch, by a large margin.  Sean Evans is among the best interviewers of all time, and Hot Ones is such a fun show because of this.  This has been my favorite episode! Conan O'Brien, Sean Evans, and everyone else involved; thank you, so much, for EVERYTHING!  I hope you have the energy to keep this stuff coming forever!
Best episode ever!
best episode to date by far
Anyone who's ever owned a bottle of Last Dab can tell you this was faked. That sauce does not pour out like it did when Conan tipped the bottle. Look at Sean's bottle to see what the sauce actually pours like.
Best episode yet! David Letterman would be a great guest.
That was...... Amazing!
Conan and Craig Ferguson are my favorite Late (Late) Night Hosts
and thats how its done dj khaled ,  🫱🎤 🍗
This might be one of the best and the funniest episode of hot ones 🤣🤣
I've never had more fun than watching this episode. Connan is GOAT status.
Dr. Arroyo: It's not good.
where was the talk of gerbils
1st time i see fear on seans face lol
That was spectacular
Greatest episode of all time!
“If my comedy has taught you anything, I have failed you.” - Conan O’Brien.
Conan is a hero as always
Best. Episode. Ever!!!!!!
Conan is the fkn man
Hall of Fame. As good as both Ramsay episodes put together. Almost a Halloween installment featuring a lanky, profane leprechaun.  But I was really worried he was going to touch his eyes.
I am dying. This is the best hot ones in a hot minute. Conan is fantastic.
The plug sounds as if he were channeling Dan Snyder.
Sean is great. Conan was a bit much.
Hilariously good video , EPIC
King Conan
Conan has nothing to prove, but still shows up and delivers an alltime great performance. It really puts to shame some of these celebs who show up with zero energy, take tiny bites, and bring nothing to the table.
Best. Guest. Ever.
Brilliantly unhinged, while being real. I knew Conan would be great, but this is just next level.
I liked it even before watching lol.
Not even Steve-O went this hard... WE'RE IN THE CONE ZONE NOW BABY!!!!
Now that’s what I call a season finale!!! Keep the feasts comin’!!!
Best...episode....ever.
Legendary every turn Conan is the best
Ive seen alot of episodes and to be frank ive been losing interest.  But this, is, the best episode of hot ones ive ever seen. Full stop.
This man ALWAYS always always makes me laugh. I freaking love Conan. This was the best pairing in the world.
Hands down the best episode! Conan rules!
just remember Conan drenched a wing in dabomb sauce for us, he did it for us.
conan does everything legendary
Wow either Conan is a beast or he has the best poker face
This is THE BEST episode ever!!!!!❤
😂😂😂
Greatest video of all time
Oh pleeeeeeeze, pleeeeeeeze, pleeeeeeeze have Arnold Schwarzenegger on this show. That would be AMAZING!!!!!! Ah-nold, Ah-nold, Ah-nold!!!!!!
Where can I find that suede jacket??
Legend
Conan and Sean just cured my a.d.d for a solid 27:20, that was amazing.
forever a legend
This was the best one ever
Epic...!
One of the best if not the best episode I've seen so far😂
Andy richter next !!!!
Conan's lips got so red I thought this was the new Joker movie.
why Conan is in a class of his own? This is why.
Conan is top tier
This was pure entertainment & comedy ♥️
Wild!
This must be the best episode right?
Man I miss Conan!!!😂
I have not laughed this hard since I can’t remember when 😂😅. This was comedic GOLD!
think he should build up his spice tolerance
I mean.. This was one of the best hot ones ever right? What a good time! :D
Hahahaha.   LIKE A FKN CHAMP! 👏 👏
Absolute legend!!!! Nothing else to say..
Conan was already a legend. Now he's just showing off. 🙂
Best episode ever
I've been following Conan religiously for 23 years, but I never knew he was a psychopath.
Legend
conan is a nut case and is great!!!!
Conan is a national treasure.
Let's goooo
Andy Kauffman would’ve approved
This might be the best episode of Hot Ones ever.
I have seen every single hot ones ever made, and this is HANDS DOWN.  The best episode ever.
Instant classic
He's crazy😂😂😂 Greatest Hot Ones ever.
The BEST ONE YET!!!! He's a beast with the bomb!
What the actual F$&k!Legend 😂
I’m crying 😂😂😂 Conan O’Brien is one of the funniest people ever.
Honestly this maybe the best episode yet, Conan truly is king
The funniest episode yet!!
Love this man 🧡 definitely been my weird crush for a long time 😂
Conan is in so much pain.
I thought no one would ever top Grohl… I haven’t laughed so hard in a long time. This was glorious.
What can you expect from the best comedian of the world?  This masterpiece of video. Came here for a laugh and recieve one of the best lessons in my life.
Greatest episode ever!!! What a season ender!
What a way to end this season! Conan is the best. He’s a national treasure. I can’t wait to watch his new show.
Im not an expert to know, but it feels like spongebob and Conan are a some of the architects of the humour of a whole generation.
What’s the point of even having more episodes?? We have witnessed the best one! What a legend 👑
imma start whispering to people that line, 4 years tops.
With that commitment I’m buying 3 subscriptions to Max.
Conan, Chaos Lord of Tzeentch
Audio STU!!!!
THIS WAS THE GREATEST EPISODE OF HOT ONES
absolute classic, meeting of minds, cross generational, love it!
Best Episode ever.‼️
💗👍
Comedy vacuum describes my workplace
This is the man who should’ve had everything. Not saying he hasn’t had a great career, but he deserved so much better.
🍻
I think this is the first episode where Sean hasn’t matched what his guest did.  I think he was just in awe and was a deer in headlights.
Is Conan still alive after this? 🤣
Thank you for making this one, I love Conan and he is right you are a great host and have a great team
This is by far my favorite episode!!!
been a conan fan since the early 2000s but he just cemented being a legend here. man drank sauce
Bro I have bipolar and this felt like watching a manic episode😂 amazing
If a homeless man had to go hard or go home: Conan.
This has to go down in history as one of the most epic hot ones episode. Conan you're a LEGEND!
This interview descended into pure chaos
Conan the LEGEND one of the faces of Great Comedy
Honestly the best episode. It's gonna be hard to top this.
Bring on Jeremy Allen White!!!
😂😂😂
I think Conan might be THE Spice Lord after this!
King Conan✊🫅
This was amazing, Conan took it like a champ
lol BEST HOT ONES YET!!!!  Conan is a beautiful nut job!!! Runners up are Flea and Steve O
Is Curtain on Twitter? I want to see his post on the aftermath because that's one trip to the toilet I'm sure he'll never forget....
I started to think Conan had COVID and couldn't taste anything.
King Conan!
Conan is about as close to a showbiz hero I dare to have.
So unhinged. Perfect guest for the show. KING
Absolutely Legendary.  Easily best hot ones ever.  Conan just rewrote the script.  Game over.
There is a reason he is a legend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Conan is the goat
I’ve never seen an episode where Sean is less in frame. The camera is glued to Conan just as it should be
I love Conan obrein
Best interview ever!
Literally the best episode I've ever seen. 🎉
Conan is a true entertainer!
Conan went beast mode
Legit the funniest one yet
Why did it seem like Sean was over Conan from the beginning.
😂😂😂😂😂
Please please please get Phil Keoghan from The Amazing Race.
This was key and peele level funny
I was crying TEARRRRRSSS @ 23:00
Conan O’Brien + The Wings Of Death = Lewis Black 😂
Conan was the only late night show who wrote his own stuff.  When the writers strike happened a few years ago, he was the only one still on lol.  Truly a funny man and super nice.
Dj khaled is crying into his blankie at the unstoppable force that is Conan the destroyer
He is the best!
Water buffalo to Conan: ..You 😡.. YOURE GONNA DIE!
Pure unbridled anarchy!
conan broke the show and made it his own. this is teamcoco territory now
Ramsey has been dethroned!
Conan's podcast remains one of the best podcasts for me in laughs per minute.  Love Conan.
Conan is the GOAT of modern late night and still amazing on his Sirius channel.
23:48 Da bomb has been defeated
this was the best episode hands down lol
This episode has become the best Hot Ones. Conan went harder than Pepper X.
This is up there with the Dave Grohl episode.
BEST. HOT ONES. EVER.
this episode is now my only favourite in this show! 🤣🤣🤣
Conan O’Brien wins hot ones
No. one. tops. Conan (on hot sauce)
I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR THIS FOR YEARS!! FINALLY!
Idk who that “doctor” is but his and Conan’s interactions were hilarious. I really hope Conan uses him. I was dying of laughter of his responses to a simple where did you go to med school? 🤣
Ok, one of the best things ever on youtube!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CONAN I WORSHIP YOU!!!!!!!!
Amazing.
I love people giving Conan proper respect
Best episode ever.
Greatest guest ever
Worth the wait. Classic! Don't do the goofy PSA ever again, it's too and lame for what you guys are doing.
Conan’s ability to take a series of funny moments and string them into a larger hilarious experience is unparalleled. Not only that he does it while never using the other person as a punching bag. He’s a legend.
Top 3 episodes of all time.
entire episode is a fever dream
The Conan Covid episode
So gingers really don't feel pain huh?😂😂
Conan gets the Olympic gold medal for this
RIP Conan
He went harder than anyone ever... mad props
Triumph the Insult Comic Dog should be next.
😂😂😂😂
This went about as good as i figured it would
He outdid Steve-O. Unreal stuff.
gosh this guy his crazy....lovin it, very entertaining 🙌🙌
This is my baby Coco lol I clicked so fast 😅
Thc Smokey j
🐐
Best guest ever!!! I laughed so hard!! The best! Conan is comedy King!
Oh my goodness 😱
Conan is a beast!
That was epic 4 hot ones
The best episode ever, man I love me some Conan!
😂😂😂🎉
I want that hairstyle. “Conan me, dear “
This is the best episode
Impressive at the last wing
When I saw the guest, I said out loud this will be interesting. Far beyond my expectations, great episode 💀
Best hot ones ever!!!
This could be the series finale
Sean with every other guest: Hey be careful around the eyes. BE CAREFUL!  Sean with Conan: 😮
incredible
Conan ws truly off the henny for this one
GOAT
Conan is COMEDY GOLD
I totally forgot about the buffalo story by the end of this but that's when Sean first says you gotta commit to the bit and also it's a story of Conan continuing to work through physical pain and trauma, hmm. . .
Still my favorite show since day 1. Bravo Feast Team!
My new all-time favourite. 😂😂😂
Best episode ever? All hail Conan.
Literally the best Hot Ones ever. Conan the GOAT.
Next week's Conan's birthday!  How do I know this.. Because it's my birthday too 😁
This went off the rails!! Conan being putting on a show for Sean, Sean enjoying it, love it.
His red fingers
After watching John Mulaney, I have to wonder if something in the SNL writing rooms altered their DNA.
I've been a fan of Conan from the very beginning. Good to see him 😂
I love Conan!
классная
No offense to the other guests but Conan just single-handedly saved this season. What a way to go out!
What a legend
Best technique ever. My fkn hero.    He stole my bit though.  I always said I would do pretty much this when I got famous..  😂
It's as if Sean interviewed Ben Stiller's "Tony Perkis" from the movie "Heavyweights."   Truly unhinged and I loved every moment of it.
I watch all episodes but never comment THAT WAS THE GREATEST ONE EVER!!!, LONG LIVE CONAN! SEAN YOU THE MAN TOO.
Hes not a good Dr. Hes affordable 😅
it would be hilarious if they just didnt put sauce on conans. hahah but nah, hes the goat for a reason
I can't stop fricken laughing. Best episode ever!!!!!
Cuhlassic Vaudeville Theatre. NOTHING compares to his delivery. Thanks Sean.
Best episode Jfc.
Watching Conan’s show every night in the late 90’s with my roommates was an integral part of my college experience. I just love this man. This was truly incredible!
What an insane man, LOVE Conan 🤣🤣🤣🤣
My respect for Conan went up 1000%
This is peak internet. The greatest of all time!
I love Mr. O’Brien and I cannot wait for April 18th what a great show that will be.
Love Conan’s rant at the end for all of the reasons.
Conan is clearly not Irish. My husband is and would have died with what just happened. But yay Conan!  Beat episode ever!,
Conan...THE BEST!!!
The descent to insanity for Conan really sped up on the last couple wings, culminating in the speech that would put Sir William Wallace to shame.
My intestines are bleeding just watching Conan eat.
LISAN AL GAIB!!
I think this is the most we’ve ever seen Sean laugh in an interview 😭
I'm so happy I got to watch this. Thank you both. ❤❤❤
Wow. This WAS the finale of ALL finalies. 🤡
Legendary! All time best in Hot Ones! Favorite moment? The one where I pressed play on this video up until the credits rolled. Wing drop.
WE GOT A NEW HOT ONES CHAMP!!!! WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT AT ALL!!!! 😂❤️‍🔥🤪🔥🌟
Say what you want about him, but you can’t say Conan O’Brien is not a fantastic entertainer
I felt for years Conan should this show. With Seans wit and conan's struggle jaja its for the ages. Sonia stop him 😂
THIS IS OLD TESTAMENT
My face is hurting after watching this. Legendary episode
This episode represents everything I've never liked about Conan's style. He's too much for me.   That said, holy cow, much respect for taking these sauces. Big ups.
This goes down as the best Hot Ones appearance ever though right? Conan brought it all.
I love how there was no question for the 9th wing, just conan rubbing sauce on the nips and moving on
Hardest in the game schooled everyone like a bish
20:57 😂😂💀
Glad conan has a new travel vlog, i've always wanted him to continue conan abroad
Let me tell ya….in person….not only is he extremely tall but he is uber svelte and quite dashing to look at as well.  With his perfect comedic timing, respectful disposition towards all, and infinite intelligence, it wouldn’t be a hyperbole to say he IS the Michael Jackson of late night comedy shows loved universally by many.  💚💚💚💚ed this episode of Hot Ones for sure!!!! ☘️🍉💚
Did Sean have clearance for this interview? Maybe Lewis spoke to him
I love that Conan came prepared with bits.
the KING of late night
"you should go", "I apologize"
by far the best of these hot one interviews yet. conan ftw
Why can’t Conan realize he’s not funny anymore and be serious.
Best episode ever!
BEST EPISODE SO FAR.... WOW. lolololol
I’m embarrassed to say I haven’t watched his stuff. This episode was a work of art. Great job
Incredible 😮 😂
Redheads can tolerate more pain
This one and Bobby Lee are my favourite episodes
GOAT!
Wow
OH MY Fkcu ing GOD..  The one thing I'm glad you did say or worn him from doing is putting his fingers in his eyes. After seeing him do all that other stuff he sure as I'm writing this he would have rubbed some hot sauce in his eyes.
Conan’s list of achievements is staggering! Handling Bill Burr as a talk show guest, making Harrison Ford enjoy a media interview, writing 3 of the all time great Simpsons episodes & now casually swigging 2,700,000 Scoville hot sauce! Icon
Conan’s impersonation of Eric Andre is spot on.
Hey just discovered Conan and I have the same Birthday 🎉🎉🎉 HBD bro!!
Yeah this is been the best episode ever!
Absolutely amazing
Please tell me that Conan didn't die off stage....
That was one of the craziest things I have ever watched and I loved every second
Best HOT ONES EVER CONAN O'BRIEN is a living LEGEND
I'm gonna watch this video every single day until the day I die.
Seriously top 3 guest
Conan is the funniest man alive best episode they’ve ever done
I can't believe this, one of the greatest guestings in hot ones ever.
Long Live, Conan!
I've never seen Sean laughing so hard before!
finally.....a good episode
Did he just win hot ones?
Best to ever do it
Best
This is the most unhinged episode ever. First time I can't tell what's real. Conan became the Red Giant.
only thing that would have made this better is if conan would have done the string dance, old cone zone fans will know what im talking about
CONAN!!!! Oh my goodness
I really hope the "doctor sanitized the stethoscope before he put it on Conan's tongue. It was on Sean's first. I know it s a bit but kinda defeats the table distance and the COVID protocols.
New Conan O'brien content! I love Conan marathon but a new content is a blessing ❤❤❤. Super excited for the new show in Hbo max ❤❤❤
THE BEST EVER
Best episode
genius
the greatest episode of hot ones so far. shall be hard to top this.
That's the Irish!!! Overdone and fun.
the most beautiful thing I've seen since Norm MacDonald... Conan wins
Conan O'Brien is the funniest human on the planet! 🤣
I’m scared he’s going to die in the night 😂
Happy burthday Coney❤️
The greatest episode of Hot One's in history.
Best episode ever
Conan will do anything for a laugh. But I was afraid he was going to take a swig of da bomb 😅
Conan- the great example of contained chaos. He looks like something that came out of the bottom of Pandora’s box and just got dropped  into holy water, creating a chaos caviar
I wish I could enjoy this without the music
Best. Hotones. Ever.
Get this man to a hospital...I love this Conan O"Brien - Fugging awesome.
Best episode. Watch out Gordon Ramsey.
This is how you advertise now I want to watch it
Conan chugging the hot sauce in unhinged, and I love it!
Well worth the price of admission. Thank you Conan O’Brien and Sean.
if this isn't the best episode of hot ones, it's at least the funniest.
That was awesome 😎
Conan is a LEGEND!!! This was HILARIOUS!!! WOOWWWW!!??!!!😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
LMAOF
Conan’s commitment is UNRIVALED!  Huzzah my man!!
Conan went full Chris, Farley and I love it! 😂
Love Conannnnnnnnnnnnnn   ;pveeeeeeeee everything is funnyyyyyyyyyy
This is the episode of Hot Ones of all time, we can stop here
Y'all make some flavored microwave popcorn with some heat.
Coman, the man! The boss!
I think this is the episode that will live on forever.
Is it not apparent that Conan is just Sean from the future?
I hope Conan sells those wings on ebay
Taking shots of hot sauce is insane, I thought he might throw a shot down the hatch on da bomb 😅😂
Best episode.. and i think top 3 in the all time spice lords in this show
Screaming through the pain is how I get through it, too 😂😂 echoing the sentiment that this is the best episode 😂🤣😂🤣
Whoever interviews Conan next needs to ask if the shouting was a way of coping.
this is so funny, Im laughing my tears out
Conan !!!!!!!
This is pure pandemonium!  But please, don't blame Conan. Don't blame Conan.
LOL Conan's skin matches his hair the further the interview goes 😅😅🤣😂😂😂
Too good 😂 Conan is a straight up legend! Miss him on his old late night format shows but do enjoy the Podcasts
If those weren’t his own clothes before this eps, they are now! 😂
Love Conan, the best one I've seen so far!
“Can you check for a pulse” then starts to put in a choke hold, hahahs 😂
Conan made Steve-O look like a totally sane person in his episode 😂
Im crying a lot to say i can't
Conan nailed it!! Hilarious and easily the most daring with the sauce. I was in tears at the end. So freaking funny 😂
This is probably best show to date. Conan really pulled out all the stops
I love Conan 😭😭😭 what a king ❤
That was GOLD
Greatest episode of all time
Conan is Legendary
Hands down the GREATEST Hot Ones episode of all time
however much you paid conan pay him 5x
Total F**KING Legend!!!
How to stay relevant with people at least 50 years younger. 👏 Jose Arroyo was awesome as well.
That’s an all time episode right there!!  You can clearly see Sean check off a bucket list interview! Conan never disappoints
Jesus Christ this was the BEST episode EVER. I’ve watched them all. I’m dying. 😆😂🤣😆😂🤣
What a beast!
"CONAN!" - Me with a mouthful of chicken nuggets anytime I see a video thumbnail with Conan O'Brien in it.
There's always been some Kaufman inside of Conan....  amazing to see him letting it out 🫡 😂
Best episode yet, Conan might not be sane after this though. Lol.
Conan is the best and always will be. Glad to get to love during his prime and see he and Dave own late night. Was a special time and this proves it lol
WOW. Instant, top-of-the-pile classic here. There were several episodes I skipped this season, but this interview alone makes this season a legendary one.
😍😍😍😍😍 Oh My God This Is Everything My Inner Child Didn't Know She Needed!!  🤣🤣🤣 born in 91' and MY GOD it is a JOY to see Conan Has Not Missed A Beat!! So many have turned out to be a**holes, and it is a SWEET Breath of Air seeing Conan has been Him since Day 1‼️   😅😅 this is undebateably my Favorite Hot Ones Episode‼️🔥🔥🔥 💝💝💝
The doctor bit was so funny i loved it.
"What's wrong with me?!? Why can't I feel?!?" Hahaha Winning.
Best episode ever!
I've been a big fan of Conan since early 2000's so this was the best episode yet! I can't remember when I last time laughed this hard :'D Pure comedy gold!
Omfg. One of the best ever. Conan is what he is, for sure.
Conan just transcends humor on all ages i mean even when i was just 16 i totally understood his banter and he was very entertaining. Now im 26 i still find him the same funny charismatic host i knew to love
The best hot ones ever.  A must re-watch over and over.  Sean just made history with this one.  Congrats Sean and crew
conan losing th epot
Epic episode, perhaps the best I've seen.
True professional. Can keep it together no matter what
Yoooo, Conan on another level 😂
I wonder if he visited the ER after this show?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
G O A T.  EP
I haven't watched it yet but best guest they've ever had
“My intestines has turned into acid and I can still remember the plot! “ I’m DEAD
I finally feel like I understand Conan now… Holy cannoli,, best Hot Ones EVER !!
He always goes all out.  The best First We Feast ever. Love you Conan.❤ PERIOD!
The irony of a 'doctor' unscrewing and handing a bottle of da bomb to their patient is extra hilarious. This whole episode had me dying.
What a showman
Conan is a madman.
Conan showers a wing, clears it, then takes a swig off the hotsause bottle. i laughed so hard i cried. 13:36 he was getting double dabs of every hot sause the whole time. i cant say what part was my fav but watching him wipe sause all over his mouth and cheeks must have been so painful. Da bomb almost made me throw in the towl when i did the 10 challenge.
Oh my goodness, that was probably the wildest Hot Ones in history. Conan was amazing,  I am not sure Sean knew what was going on, but it was amazing. I wonder how long Conan is going to be feeling those wings.
nice
Classic Conan energy. Awesome episode! ❤
Conan is more extra than the sauce. They need to make a sauce after the last dab called the Conan sip.
Conan "Anything for a Laugh" O'Brien, everyone!
Legit fearing for Coco’s life here
Conan is such a natural. Love him.
Amazing
Conan sees people nibble on a wing… he dowses it in hot sauce and finishes it
Where’s the spice!!!!! Haha Conan Legendary
This one's gotta be up there with Bill Burr.....absolute legend of an episode
I could listen to Conan all day.  Actually maybe for a few hours, tops. he's interesting, but everything in moderation.
Imma get a Conan tattoo...I love him that much!
When Conan said the worst thing a guest can do is telling the audience that the show isn't going well, the first thing I thought of was DJ Khaled 😂
This is it. The greatest episode of Hot Ones. I was laughing and clapping. Unprecedented
Ok. This was the best episode of the season. I can't believe what Conan did with those sauces. He's a total badass.
😂 What a hilarious mess! Conan, thank you for the crying laughter 😆
Idgaf what anyone says Conan is the best late night host
Oh my god this was incredible 😂😂😂😂😂! I'll definitely ask max about his new show
Bahaha. What a legend.
Best episode of hot ones ever. Love you Conan O'Brian 😍
best so far
An instant classic. The best to ever do it. Long live Conan
I don't have any friends. It would be really cool to have Conan as a friend. I've watched him for many years and enjoy his stuff. He really seems like a genuine and kind person. I haven't heard or read any saying anything bad about him.
Dude made a remote as the interviewed. Best episode ever
Conan’s stomach went on strike 24 minutes later. The next day had to be rough on the toilet 😱😱💀💀🤣
Best episode ever.  I hope DJ Khalid sees it.
people need to understand that conans red hair blocks out the heat from the hot sauce.
The best episode
Now we gotta get Jordan Schlansky. Make it happen Sean.
Amazing. Thank you!
This was hilarious cause it was funny and also cause I started retching looking at the war taking place around Conan's mouth
Not since Coolio have I been so concerned for someone on this show
We love Conan!!!
conan is simply the goat.
Conan is my favorite entertainer, nay, person in the world. I could watch Conan talk to Sean for hours. Hopefully Sean goes on the podcast.
There was an episode of The Simpsons where Homer coats his tongue in wax so he can eat an insanity pepper. Not sure if Conan wrote on that episode, but I'm convinced that's exactly what he did
He turned into Lucille Ball after 17:21 😂🤣😂🤣😂
conan is the GOAT
Hot Ones is always an amazing show, but as someone who enjoys some of the old episodes with more of the crazy shenanigans more than the newer ones, this may be a new best episode of all time.
Best episode ever. Only way it could have better is with a postgame presser 15 minutes later.
Easily one of the funniest people ever
That dig at Leno was perfection. I absolutely love Conan and would love to sit down and talk with him sometime.
Legendary.
Okay... That was hands down, the absolute GREATEST episode of Hot Ones. I salute you Conan. You are a true living legend.
I was not expecting this after how he didn’t handle the hot sauce too well on his murderville episode. 😂
I feel sorry for Conan colon the next day.
Pure comedy genius!
lol
😂 crazy now we know why he was late night 😮
This finale wings had something else lol! Conan always going above and beyond! Loved it!!
Love. Conan.
GOAT
Unexpectedly, one of the best episodes yet.
Hahaaaa love yah conan.
Best. Episode. Ever. Thank you, Conan!
😂🤣🙌🏻
Conan is a national treasure! In my opinion, he was the true King of Late Night.
I think he's got 4 years left to live, tops.
Hands down best episode yet.
Taking the wing scraps is a power move.
Conan is the man's man! Lol
this man is CRAZY! this is my MOST FAVORITE EPISODE EVER OH MY GOD
Holy moly, hands down best episode yet 😂
Conan O’Brien                        The Champion Of Hot Ones 🔥
Yup. Conan topped them all. Best episoide of Hot Ones ever!
legendary
It used to be called "Cinemax"... lol
Proof that comedians have the strongest mental toughness of anyone:P
now that's entertainment!!!
Hands down, best Hot Ones ever.
That episode was so good I’m gonna watch it again, wow, Conan went nuclear, oh man that was awesome. Dude is a legend, made it big back in the day and still drove a Ford Taurus (albeit it was the awesome SHO). That was gold! Wow
Once again, Narduar needs to be on this show.
Conan is the greatest Hot Ones guest, EVER!!!! 🤣🤣
GET IT CONAN, GET IT! Probably one of the BEST finales...I don't think it can be topped. Well done Conan, well done.
BEST EPISODE EVER…. HALLE SECOND…
Conan is so funny. I love him
Conan fans instantly laughed when they saw the "doctor"
As if you weren't a legend....a massive legend........you came and made it the best episode ever!!!!! HAHAHAHA!
Every now and then there’s someone who breathes new life into the show. But Coco absolutely killed it!
I freakin' love Conan man. He's been having me dying laughing since I was a child! This was perfect and exactly what I'd expect from him! My favorite comedian 😂😂😂
Love you Conan!!!
Chile mono loco from Costa Rica… great stuff..Always makes me cry
I dont watch a lot of Hot Ones  Of all the Ones i have seen... Conan's was the very best...quite literally took on the Heat like ot had no effect on his Tenacity to literally swig some Hot sauce straight   GOD Bless You and many Outrageous Comedians in thie Bleak yet Extraordinary World...of glitz and glammor Humble and Humbled and Narcissist
I’ll have whatever he’s smoking
This is a masterpiece.
I wish to see more of Sean’s reaction to Conan pouring hot sauces into his mouth and body. Like side by side views on the screen. But this one is my top favorite of all time.
broke the show in the best way possible what an incredible performance!!!!!!!
"I never saw a spice.. until I was about 52 years old"  hahaha ^ ^  this will be interesting!
#1 best episode!
The most Irish man in America just covered his tongue in da bomb and yelled through it what timeline is this
He complimented you then it all went downhill. What were those goofy questions??
The best episode of the show easily
Probably the down best episode Hot Ones has ever had.
I've never clicked so fast onto a video and I've never been so moved by a youtube video
This is the ultimate guest, haven’t even watched it yet but this show doesn’t know what it’s getting themselves into.  Conan is super human for his comedy and this is a huge playground  edit: I’ve never been more right in my life
This episode will go down as history  That guy was nutzss
Conan is a legend!
I've never laughed so hard during an episode. Awesome Job, Conan!!
Hands down the best hots ones episode to date
I love u Conan
As a person named Max I do not like that HBO is just called max.
Conan is the final boss
The best episode so faarrr
This is THE MOST HILARIOUS EPISODE EVER! I was in literal tears laughing 😂
We've finally witnessed Conan having a breakdown while eating spicy wings.
Best guest so far.  I think I need a drink after watching this.  Conan rocks.
The most insane and impressive guest of all time! 😂
_W I T N E S S H I S G L O R Y_
WHY CANT I FEEEEEL 😂😂
Hands down best Hot Ones for me
Conan is a great guy <3 this will be fun to watch!
Conan came in and broke the format. He was not disarmed, he one of the only people to come in and disarm Sean. The GOAT.
BA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!!!!!!! 😂❤💀
I think this is the working definition of UNHINGED.
I married into an Irish family... They've never seen a spice
This Comedy King has everybody beat. We will refer to Hot Ones pre or post Conan!
Sean: "as is tradition we have the 1st.2nd,3rd,4th,5th,6th,7th,8th,9th, and the last dab"
Exceeding expectations as always
Incredible. Hot Ones at its best.
Conan is the definition of FAFO when it comes to comedy. What a legend.
Wow, Conan.
I'm literally crying. An all time performance. Thank you for your sacrifice
God I love Conan so much, he’s the funniest comedian of the late night hosts.
Conan is a beast!
Conan making this the best episode of Hot Ones I have ever seen.
Best episode ever.
He went to Harvard… 😏
A legend among legends
“The other guy”. Classic
Craziest episode ever!!!   What a beast. Nobody is gonna top that.  Dude drank one of  the hottest sauces known to man.    Insane.
"I never saw a spice until I was 52 years old is wild hahahahaha" Gotta love COnan!
“What’s wrong with me?! Why can’t I feel?!” I’ve been laughing this entire episode. You can’t top this. 😂
S tier, probably the best episode! Love Conan, he always delivers.
My god, when he took a swig straight from the bottle of the Last Dab, I physically winced. I’ve tried it and a few dabs are painful enough.
Conan drank candle wax prior to the show, an idea he got from an old TV show he wrote for.
You really made it, Sean!
He's the only talk show host that young people like. I watched him through highschool he's sick asf
the best one yet
Conan love that guy
All my respect to Conan,. That's a PROFFESIONAL for no doubt.
I’ve never liked talk show hosts (they never seem genuine) but Conan was the one that changed that for me. 10/10 episodes
Conan is a master of this type of comedy! I've literally never gut laughed watching this show until today. Well done sir, well done...
Conan would make a great older Joker.
Best episode hands down.
Conan being Conan
This man had his  dream stolen by Jay Leno.  Hot wings got nothing on him.
😂Conan the Barbarian came out 😂
Legend!
GOAT
Ain’t nothing beating CONAN bish-slapping Da Bomb! 💣 👅
Wow, Conan's commitment to the bit is amazing.
Conan gangster af. Warrior poet.
W
Who woulda thought? not me
No one will top this episode 😅 I can't see anyone surpassing this performance MVP level I mean this might have topped steveo
Im absoluitely convinced he would literaly walk through fire on glass to entertain.   While wrestling an alligator.
Hot sauce does not affect gingers!  😂
Conan is the GOAT
Conan is THE GOAT 🐐 interviewer. Cant check him
Conan, the best episode i've seen so far! I started tearing up laughing at 20:52. Haven't seen something so funny in a long time!
I want this whole episode animated in Simpsons style
Conan just pulled a full Johnny Knoxville there.
Conan said “season finale? Say less”
This was the funniest episode ever! This was the perfect antidote to the boring nonsense that was Ice Spice.
blokes just not funny at all
16:59 Conan licks the wing and there’s a very quiet scream from off set. This is why he’s my GOAT, sell out for the bit to the point someone is audibly alarmed. So so funny.
What's the point of bringing anyone else on after this episode?  Lol, Conan smashed this out of the park and whoever come up to bat afterward can't possibly hope to be as entertaining.  The king showed up, the king ate, the king dropped knowledge, the king left a crater-sized impact of entertaining insanity, and the king shut it down for anyone else.  Ever.
that was awesome
The true definition of epic!
Conan is the goat. This was something i never imagined you guys could pull off and im all in for it 👏🏼  Side note : F* Jay Leno
watch the first thing conan says to his last , the way he quickly unravels is so good
Conan's a legend for this.
This has to be in the top 3 interviews this show has ever done. And it might not be 3rd or 2nd place.
Best episode ever!!!
Once you go CONAN, there’s no CONAN back!
probably the best guest appearance so far.  good work
🙌🏻 i am going to subscribe to hbo max just to watch Conan!! He is such an entertainer
Possible greatest guest of all time
I have been watching this show since the first episode, and this is, hands down, the best one you've ever done.
Bravo bravo!
Conan will always be the best late night show host! During the writer's strike in 2008, he paid all the writers out of his pocket for MONTHS while also delivering some of the funniest and most chaotic episodes of his show on his own without any writers ❤ Team CoCo forever ❤
Conan is riding high on the spice
best one so far, conan is the goat
Freaking hilarious 😂😂. Best one ever
Conan is a legend. I literally cried watching this.
What an Absolute MAD LAD.  Greatest Show in the History of FWF.  Conan the Goat!
Bravo Conan…Bravo 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🤌🏾🇺🇸🦅🇺🇸
His wife is gonna find chicken bones in the wash, lol!
"NO! NO BITS!"  Executes several ongoing bits during the interview
Sean getting the interviewer stamp of approval from Conan is so vindicating. Recognition from an undisputed legend in the craft
Just commenting to help the algorithm for this episode. Best episode of Hot Ones imho.
Okay. This was a phenomenal episode. Conan is the GOAT
The best late night host ever!! Kimmel and Fallon can go!
Conan just simultaneously broke the show & created its best ever episode
I love conan
This was Andy Kaufman-esque.
This was by far the best episode yet! Thank you!
I wanted to wipe his mouth so bad! Lol 😅
This episode was hijacked
He demolished those wings
I don't know if this is the best one but I feel like it is! Correction. I finished the video and it is the best thing I've ever seen!!👍🔥
I lost it when he open the hot sauce and drink it.😂
This is absolutely the best episode.  second place isnt even close
Glorious. Alarming! but glorious.
Epic. Conan just raised the bar 3x.
conan is comedy bae 😎♥🎈
I don’t know who makes the ranking for Hot Ones guests but I think Conan clearly claims the number one spot with this performance
I wonder if he coated the inside of his mouth with wax?
Great show guys! Conan.... You out did it and were a great laugh! Thank you!
this was by far the greatest one ever. Conan killed it
Stream Conan Must Go on HOME BOX OFFICE APRIL 18TH
This is the best Hot Wings episode of all time!! Conan is an absolute comedic genius and a national treasure.
Finally, Conan on Hot Ones...❤❤❤
The funniest episode ever!
Best. Episode. Ever.
Conan won. Comedy on top of consuming more hot sauce than to others willingly. He's had it for 30 some years.
conan taking notes from bob mortimer who always carries pocket meat
i love how inflamed conan's lips become with each new wing
Sean always follows what the guest does with the wings, except for Conan.
The greatest episode since Paul Rudd
Excellent episode, and Conan just.... well...being Conan
Freakin goat ! 🤯🤣❤️
I really needed a laugh today. Thank you Conan!
wings hall of famer this guy
Love Conan but this is how I imagine a hot ones episode with John Belushi going
This show is never going to be the same again
Is Conan O'Brien the greatest showman alive? Hats off to this guy!
Best ever!
This was like watching David Blaine except actually entertaining!
The best yet!
Isn't this what killed Coolio?
Best episode ever!
Is this the same Conan that drinks spicy Guinness?
Best episode, hands down! So funny! 😂🔥
Conan is a legend
Conan brought that Deer Hunter pack
thisis the best episode of anything ive ever seen
Dr. Arroyo's brother used to be a writer on CONAN
Not the best but very affordable.. My mantra
"I grew up on tasteless food" LOLOL
I effin love Conan !!! Been watching him for years lol I like to call him the evil comedy genius lol .. I love smart comedy… and Conan is right you are an amazing interviewer..
Should’ve given him the Shaq sauce
Funniest FWF ever! Conan is unstoppable
This is the best Hot Ones of all time. There is a sort of sadness that it will never get better than this.
One of the best interview!
I loved this.  Fantastic!
The best interviewer challenging the best interviewer. SUPER CLASSIC.
Somebody tell me how this wasn’t all 100% fake and Coney wasn’t just doing another bit like he does with every other waking breath of his brilliant existence
I’m fine
Conan's message "dont be cynical" always resonated and stuck with me. He exudes joy, he shares it, and i hope to do the same for as long as i live.
TIL Conan and I have the same birthday!
Love how the animators drew a bull instead of a water buffalo.
Conan talking about getting on the Buffalo stating "I never listen to Andy"  But when you go look up the clip and Conan is talking about the bruise, Andy says "drop-trow and show 'em right now"  Conan does not miss a beat. One could argue there's even a twinkle in his eye.
This was the best episode ever. 😆🤘🔥🔥🔥
The thought of Hot Ones calling it a day after this one scares me. Conan just set the bar WAY too high.
Conan THE GOAT
conan slayed this
conannnnnnnnn
Conan going more extreme then even Steve-O. So impressive and hillarious. What an amazing end to the season.
Conan is the American Colin Mocherie
this may be the best hot ones of all time.
CONEY!!
Heroic is an understatement.
Oh he’s got to be hurting the next day though
Best guest! Absolute showman.
So many meme-able moments from this episode
Conan bro...the hair...better be a prop😂
Between the doctor and pocketing chicken wings, this is a perfect Conan interview
This is why Conan is the GOAT talk show host. His humor transcends generations.
Bravo. This is the best one yet.   DJ Khaled level of confidence yet the outcome was fully opposite
Dr Arroyo was a HILARIOUS addition to the show! I was busting up when he put the stethoscope on Sean's tongue! And he said he should have graduated from college! Lol! Too much!
How did I know that Conan would be the goat on hot ones! What a legend
Conan made Sean injure himself trying to keep up.  HAHAHAHA!!
All i was thinking please not in the eyes
Just................wow.
Probably one of the best episode i've ever seen.
Probably one of the best episode i've ever seen.
Conan is the best!!!!!!
Conan needs to go down as one of the greatest people in comedy. I feel bad for anyone that doesn’t see the humor and intellect in every single thing he says. It’s not researched. It just genius. He seems like a genuinely great person. It’s impossible to listen to or watch anything the does and not laugh.
I haven't watched this show in forever, but I'm so glad I did for this one. This was absolute gold.
a true teacher
Best episode to date
Oh goodness. This man is unwell. And yet... I couldn't take my eyes off him.
Some of the jokes they made to throw away are still some of the funniest things I remember from that show. They had some really good jokes and meta things like the Interrupter on that show especially when it was in New York.
That was just what I was hoping for.  Conan is the best!
This is the best episode ever. Period.
Best episode ever
Conan entered as a talk-show host, and left as King of the Heat.
lol!
This is an all-timer. Not since Gordon Ramsay.
Best episode ever 😂😂😂
Best , episode ever!
Well, I guess Im watching Hot Ones again
Conan is unhinged
Best episode of all time. Mic dropped!
I'd die to see one with Conan and Jordan Schlansky, the comedy would be gold.
Wow. This is now *the* most unhinged episode of Hot Ones of all time and therefore a new bar has been set for future guests. Bravo, Conan.
one of the greatest episode
I wish they would sell the bottles that they use in each episode. Do they?
I gotta hear Conan give us the scoop on how he did after the filming, on his podcast.  I hope he was fine and if he was, he has got an iron gut! That pepper X and it's 2.6 million Scoville number is serious heat!
BEST HOT ONES YET! What a legend. 👏👏👏
Watch the Conan O’brian interview. The guy did it without any complaint + was the funniest of all guests ever
This is why Conan is always sick on the podcast after travelling 😂 just rubbing his hands in his mouth like that!
Conan The Barbarian O'Brien takes no prisoners, tears will be shed, laughs will be had, and the spices will flow!
EPIC 😂 watched on Apple TV and had to get my phone to drop a like and comment… Conan’s the goat
18:13 conan's lip filler starts to appear 🤣
Shout out to Irish Catholic upbringings - Peppers a little spicy for us
There is no way Conan was not regretting his antics a lot, but he's such a showman he just powered through it.
Conan went so hard it killed O.J.
….and you didn’t get Schlansky on with him?
Conan officially is now the funniest guest on hot wings after that performance.
Conan is honestly the GOAT
Has to be one of the best hot ones ever. I laughed so hard watching this episode. 😂😂😂
@19:38 Does anyone know the president Conan is talking about cuz I think he made a mistake. I Googled Warren Harding and he died of a heart attack after three years in office. I don't see anything about him leaving a note either.
Requesting a follow up episode to see if Conan is still alive after chugging down all that hot sauce 😅😅😅
The GOAT 🐐
is this an apology for the ice spice ep?
Conan is one of the only late night show hosts I actually respect and like, this was a beautiful episode combo
THERE is NOONE like Conan! He is a walking Bit in every great way
Conan is and forever be my most favorite late night host... I've seen Carson, Letterman ... thank you ... Conan you're the greatest
This could be the best episode I have seen 😂
you should interview ella purnell
No episode will ever even come close to being as amazing as this was. Conan destroyed and conquered those wings.
11:00 that clip of Conan falling and showing off his bruise is really something else. He actually showed the footage.
godd dang....Conan is a MONSTER profesional in everything he does.
Best episode ever. EVER!!! Crushed every wing plus drank the sauces. Then killed as the funniest guest ever.
Conan is madness incarnate.
What a great finale
Okay...no one is going to top that performance. Might as well switch the show to cool ones and have people eat different type of ice cream.
I love Conan's jacket, but I love Sean more!
The most epic hot ones and torch possessor Conan for all time
I appreciate the bit, but he derailed the interview. I wanted to hear Sean's questions.
Mind altering substances….. don’t do drugs kids….
This was epic!
Best f'ing guest yet!!!!!!!!
I almost died watching this video. Too good! Conan turns the tables on the format and delivers the best Hot Ones to date.
WOW  Im at a loss for words  wow
Conan is an absolute wrecking ball.  I bout crapped my pants when I saw this thumbnail. Absolutely derailed the interview with his absurdity.
As soon as i seen Conan O'Brian on the thumbnail i KNEW it was gonna be a good show!!! He Delivered!! Great Performance!!
The best part of the Dr Arroyo bit was Conan saying he's affordable every single time 😂
The older he gets, the more he sounds like Nathan Lane.
The amount of times I screamed "No, Conan!! Don't!!" at the screen. The world's greatest maniac. 💥
Is Conan alive after this? 😂
Gotta love Conan, he knows all the social cues and ignores them all. 👌
I like to think Conan took the wings so he can throw them at Sona later on. 😂
I feel bad for the doctor who was obviously pressured and manipulated into doing that by Conan who is obviously a narcissist. I hope Conan knows that doing things like that to people really hurts.
Bravo! Would not have expected anything less!!!
incredible
What an episode
Ok we forgive you for the last two episodes now
Hilarious! First time watching a whole EP. Just seen clips until now. 😂
I have never yelled “NO STOP” so much in my life! 😂 Amazing episode! Two of the greatest!
Best episode ever
I wish I could smash that like button a million times over. Conan O'Brien has been and always be the FUNNIEST man I've ever watched on TV since I was 13 years old. I'll be there April 18.
Hands down…. THE BEST
The word GOAT gets thrown around way too much these days, so ill just say Conan is the all time funniest and greatest television personality of all time. Truely one of a kind. ❤
The definition of trying too hard. Not the best episode.
This was unhinged
He's officially the king of the Hot Ones challenge.
What a legend. My respects! 👊🏼🔥
I think this is the best episode ever, and yea there’s a lot of really good episodes 😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
I was today years old, when I learned Conan and I have the same birthday.
Hot wings & even hotter guests 😅
This is the most entertaining Hot Ones by far! 😂❤❤❤
Is Conan ok? This was one of the most wild ones
10 minutes in, is Conan planning to clean the board?
This is by far the best episode ever!!!!!!!!
I love that the cameraperson facing Conan somehow manages to be just as funny as Conan himself
this is by far the most disgusting episode of this show and it's great.
24:34 Conans tinder pic
This was everything I didn’t know I wanted! 😂
Best episode yet!
I love you Conan
This episode is outstanding
This was perfection 🎉
I love conan soo muchhh!! Amazing purely amazing 🎉
Best episode ever!!! He literally poured hot sauce on multiple wings. Share this with everyone. Having a fake doctor is genius and harilious.
this reminds me of conan in Murderville when he ate the sloppy jalapenjoes
CALL THE WIFE!
Conan!!!
Never seen a guest react to "Da Bomb" like that!! The Best!!!
This is the best episode ever! Love how he said he’s done it for all the young people who want him on the show. Went through the wings lile a pro at 60 years old. What a legend. I salute you Conan 🫡 love from Istanbul ❤
I have not laughed this hard in a long time. This was Incredible.
I haven’t watched every episode, but this has gotta be the best one I’ve seen.  If this wasn’t a dream come true for Sean then I don’t know what’s what.
Dr. Aroyo should definitely be the next guest.
Conan is the Goat!
Conan is the goat..
No I’m not going to Texas. I’ve got better things to do
Conqn is the GOAT
When can we get the Spice King on here?
That was the best episode ever. I haven't laughed that hard in years.
Shane was not right there with the guest this time they were on their own
Coco I love you! ❤😂
This might be one of the greatest interviews of all time
i love conan so much this is the best hot ones
Host versus host and Conan has to steal the show with his own whacky doctor lol
I’m not sure what I just watched lol
Absolute legend
Conan O’Brien coming in hot to do the best Hot Ones episode by far
That was definitely my favourite 3rd act of any hot ones episode. It was off the rails in that satisfying Conan way
This makes top 5 guests easily…
One of the best episodes( if not the best..) Really Impressive and entertaining ❤
best episode in a long while, well done sir, well done
What  an epic season finally....Bravo!!!
This right here is why I have an entire playlist dedicated to just Conan and his staff. One of the best to ever do comedy, travel, or whatever situation he puts himself into.
I am 100% biased, as a person who grew up with Conan and was 12 when his show started.  This is by far the best Hot ones episode.  And that's saying a lot.  Conan is a legit legend, and still funny as ever.  And now he has the wisdom to go along with that comedy genius he has.
I feel like I just saw a little bit of Chris Farley and Steve-O in Conan.
Dr. Arroyo vs. Dr. Spaceman
Conan can carry a conversation better than anyone
Sean, FWF Folks, This is the new "Top of the Mountain". This is the best yet from your team. Just amazing.
hands down best episode I've ever seen!
Was this directed by Eric Andre haha
Best episode ever.
I love Conan. This is hilarious
Incredible 👏
You GOT to be kidding!!!! The guy doesn't have any taste buds left or what????
HE'S DOING EVERYTHING I WOULD DO! MOCK THE SAUCES, Weird bits. God. My comedy really is inspired by him
"I'M FINE! DIDN'T COME UP WITH ONE WING THAT HAS ANY EFFECT ON CONAN! CUZ HE'S HERE TO STAY! AWOOO! AWOOO!" That certainly sounds like a person who has in no way been effected. Well handled, sir.
What a legend
GOAT
I'm 41 now and been a fan of Conan since I was about 12 watching him with my grandma on summer break... he is the greatest never disappoints
This one is YouTube history
I haven't laughed this much since Bobby Rhee crapped his pants on this show back in the early days. 🤣
Amazing episode!
Haha I gasped so many times
I'm calling it! BEST EPISODE EVER!
I can’t believe Conan is Irish. After all these years
LONG LIVE CONAN!!!! ❤
God bless Conan O’Brien. There will never be another.
When he starts sipping the sauce I lost it 😂😂😂
I literally, not figuratively, fell out of my chair.
Standing ovation. What a champion. That's why he's the best.
this was by far one of the most enjoyable hot ones ever
That was wild
This is an all-timer.
25:15 "THATS RIGHT,  MY INTESTINES HAVE TURNED INTO ACID! .....AND I CAN STILL REMEMBER THE PLUG!..... THATS A PROFESSIONAL!!!!! ...IF THERE WAS A MIC DROP I'D DO ONE!! ...BY I CAN DO A WING DROP!!" -  CONAN O BRIAN (LIVING LEGEND)😎
Conan is the best guest ever. S tier. Not even the two Gordon Ramsey episodes are this wild.
I’ve waited so long for this day. Conan is an absolute unit. He drank that hot sauce like it was nothing.
I think that it'll be VERY hard to beat Conan here in one of the best ever to be on the show. Off the top of my head, I think The Rock could be legendary, Jim Carrey could be up there, but this was great.
Conan killed Bea Arthur!!!
The fear in Sean’s eyes lol
I wonder if Conan had covid during this episode and just couldn't taste the heat. lol
i knew Conan wasn't from earth
I just witnessed the single greatest Hot Ones episode to date! 🤣
Best hot ones ever
Greatest Hot Ones episode of all time!
Was Sean even in this episode? 😂
This is the funniest I've ever seen. Masterpiece. Conan is a God.
EASILY the GREATEST Hot Ones EVER. Conan is a living legend and one of the funniest humans to ever walk the earth. 😂
i wonder if he took that miracle berry to get through that hot sauce.....
That was probably, no, definitely was the best Hot Ones episode I have ever seen.
Conan is nuts😂
There was talk of gerbils ...
That was awesome my new favorite!
Wow ❤
Best episode ever!!!
Hands down, the greatest episode.
Love Conan! 😂
Coming in with that Jim Carrey energy 😂
This is the most deserving video of a subscribe and like on YouTube.
The best episode in a long time. Conan is one of the true GOATs of comedy
Never thought I'd see a guest to own it like a boss. Many have tried failed. Others have just been a bi_txh. Others have cried like a baby. Don't know how Conan did it but he owned the interview and the consumption of sauce. So many guest have not been as great as Conan did the show.
The all time, what a ride!!
Funniest episode ever! LOL!
THE GOAT TALK SHOW HOST
This dude is a legend.
💀
THIS IS SERIOUSLY THE BEST episode I have ever witnessed!!!!!
This is the best episode. Mic drop.
Best episode in the history of Hot Ones
Best. Episode. Ever. He's a mad man!
How in the Funk do you not ask the one question worth asking? Norm MacDonald?
Conan is a straight beast! 🤘😈
just cancel the show . it just peaked
Conan is untouchable 🤣The greatest to ever do it. His humor is unmatched
Best Episode.yet 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm crying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
now.. that's entertainment right there.. past and present... timeless 😂😂
I knew this would be great when I saw Conan and boy was I right. Conan just wants to spread laughter like only he can. There's no way I'll love another episode more than this one.
reminds me of the simpsons episode where homer drinks candle wax to eat the world's hottest pepper... conan drank candle wax, didn't he?
Da Bomb starts at 16:28
cant possibly be less funny
I did this challenge. The last one was not as hot as da bomb. Da bomb messed me up the most outta all of em.
Why is this only 27 minutes 😭
Conan will deeeeeply regret this in the morning.
Conan is the funniest person alive and has been since the 90s
how far can he go and embarassed or degrading someone, like im sure this doctor aint that bad and he's making fun of him, i hope its really arranged, otherwise i would hate this dude even more than i actually do
How is Conan more crazy than Eric Andre XD
After watching Conan for years its funny to hear him swear with no bleep.
Conan making a mockery out of these hot sauces!
Bravo😅🤣👏👏👏
Conan broke the format.... Legend...
This is the most unhinged episode I've ever seen! 😭🤣
Case closed no reason to continue...
The. Master.
I could not believe how this unfolded. Conan is a madman and I loved every second of it!
Conan is my hero.   When is Jordan Schlansky getting an invite?
I think this beats Shias take on the hot wings
Conon is a tool
Well that was the best Hot Ones episode ever. Shut down the show.
Conan took this show to another dimension at minute 21 😂😂😂😂😂
Red Rogue O'Raoyal
I love Conan and I can't get enough of Sean because he reminds me so much of Nardwuar. I was curious if Conan would act himself or his late nigh self. I kept a smile on my face the entire time. I honestly believe Conan answered as himself while keeping his late night host self. Such a great episode that I will most defiantly watch multiple times. Thank you both.
"I'm feeling this one a little bit" absolutely SENT me
Deff top 5 episodes. Conan is crazy lol
Conan straight up 4 + 4
best show ever!!!!!!!!!!!
Now Conan needs to invite Sean to his podcast to talk about the experience and the weirdest guests
The GOAT!!!
I FREAKING LOVE CONAN xD !! This did NOT disappoint.  Such a professional showman.
CONAN telling you you’re great, that’s something
The doctor is pure comedy 😂
GOAT
I think this is as close as we will ever get to having Robbin Williams on the show.
Conan is 😂😂
I swear to God this has to be their best episode so far
I love Conan but I don’t really get humor from the States. It’s always grotesque
Absolute battiest legend
So good
His hairline hasn't aged a day!
Got gross at the end 😮 otherwise was a fun episode. But gross. Conan I didn’t need to see that
Conan is love, Conan is life i say
Sean looks legitimately concerned 😂
I loved this man before I found out he was an insane zi0nist
This was so funny it’s ridiculous!!! Also, when he referred to Jay Leno as “the other guy” no love lost there lol.
best hot ones episode Ever. This can not be topped. Conan can not be stopped! You've heard of a 🎤 drop, naw, he did a wing drop. 1.3 million views in 10 hours, btw. 🎉🎉
Just have to say, well done Conan, that's the kind of effort you definitely cannot fake!
CONAN IS THE KING OF FUNNY!! 😂😂😂
Conan's constant shtick is so good
This is amazing
Crazier than steve-o!
Today I saw an Irishman drink Hot Sauce and live.  Absolute legend.
I have to assume Conan shat himself 20 minutes after completing shooting. Never seen anyone do that much hot sauce on this show!
love Conan tipping the hat absolute mad man
Conan’s bhole is gonna be redder than his hair by tomorrow
Conan was freebasing Anbesol for an hour before taping.
My name is Shawn and selfishly I like when celebrities say our name lol
I  MISS  CONAN  O'BRIAN  🇺🇸 (most Authentic interviewer EVER)
Best one ever. Never thought I would love Conan. Always hated him but now I’m a total fan for life
Conan said growing up with so many siblings, if you don't hurry and eat, you don't get to eat. It SHOWS... guess he will eat ANYTHING before anyone else eats.. he's practically Joey from Friends on Hot Ones sauce! Da Bomb didn't bomb him, just farted!
hahaha conan is too much haha. Love the guy
Face hurts from laughing so hard. ♥️ Coco... But seriously, can someone please check if our man is alive. I'm so worried about him. Someone besides Arroyo.
*Dr Arroyo puts the stethoscope directly into Sean's mouth*  "It's not good"  😂😂😂
Best episode to date
conan reinvented the last dab. he shattered it. there was no spice tolerance in existence before this man.  sidenote has anyone checked on him since this wrapped
Lets get Jay Leno & David Letterman on!!!!!!!!
RIP
That’s about what I expected! Love it!
Jay did nothing wrong.
First Jimmy Fallon now this, Conan has been making his way into the limelight again and complementing everyone along the way
the ending is pure gold XD
Incredible. Just incredible.
Masking physical pain through loud comedy. Also I’m worried that doctor is a quack.
HE CRAZZY
Not me googling our 29th president 😬
dj khaled quit after like 3 wings. Conan literally drank from the hottest sauce bottle. They are just not the same
This video got uploaded less than twelve hours ago and already hit a million views.
Best one to date! Conan is a fkn legend‼️
Best. One. Ever!
Conan's Energy + Adrenaline High = Episode Perfection
Simpsons did it
Conan proved he as funny as he has ever been. What a way to close out SEASON 23!!! Amazing Sean.
Conan won Hot Ones. Cancel the show. No one will do it better.
I saw this and never clicked so fast on a video.  I've never seen Conan this...normal, and then, it became chaos.
Sean has finally met the ultimate guest! That’s it, end the show, nobody can top Conan! 😂
We do need warmer wings for the near future interviews.
Returned for a second watch because I forgot to smash the like button the first time on this masterpiece.
I’ve never seen an episode where Sean is genuinely knocked off balance by the guest. Conan is king.
I would love to see all of the behind the scenes and extended footage they have on this interview. For an interview to be crushed this hard has me begging for an extended version!
Haven’t watched hot ones in forever, saw Conan and clicked immediately
Conan is the Best and David Letterman after 🫡🫡
🐐 episode.
He was trying to hard
Conan is the best
Love Conan
Hands down the best episode to date. Conan is a beast and the GOAT
Conan was on so many drugs for this, you can just tell from his bloodshot eyes
no questions about his time as a writer on The Simpsons. aw
One word....  Crazy...! The brass ba#$s on Conan.....😮
Ghandi, Popeye, Conan
This has to be the GREATEST Hot Ones Episode of all time!!!!
It blows my mind Conan is the same age as Maynard James Keenan. Let that set in.
Conan is so talented and intelligent but he is also such a thespian and has a veneer of fakeness.  He's entertaining but he'll never be a Bourdain.
Conan O'Brien is an Emmy Award–winning talk-show host who had a nearly three-decade–long run on late night. You can keep with him these days on Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend wherever you get your podcasts. He also has a brand-new travel show where he's visiting Conan fans all over the world—it's called Conan O'Brien Must Go, and it's set to release on Max April 18th. But how is he with spicy food? Find out as the comedy titan discusses hijinks at 30 Rock, his legacy in late night, the funniest US presidents, Don Quixote, and much more in one of the most high-octane Hot Ones of all time. This is the season finale to top all season finales!        Why did I just copy and paste the entire description… lol?
The best person to have in this show. I loved him late night when I was younger. Watched him late nights on school nights
"You're like Rick Flair cutting a promo right now" 9:30 WOOOOOOO!!!!!!
GIVE CONAN HIS SHOW BACK!!!! AMERICA HAS SPOKEN!!!
You have to love Conan. He's an absolute madman.
stole the season
My lord 😂 did this man have me rolling laughing!!! This was executed so  perfectly 👌 I thought  it was a scripted  skit. Never in a million  years did I think Conan would be the one to dominate  Hot ONES 🔥. My hat off to you, Sr. Well done !!!
I haven't laughed this hard in a while. Thank you Conan
Dude is crazy
Even as a young kid, like... way too young to really even understand what late night tv was. Even then, I would try to stay up to watch Conan because he legitimately was just that hilarious. He was so funny that he made me laugh even when i couldn't really fully understand the context of what was going on. That's his genius.   There's a reason why a lot of us still seek out his work even though he isn't on tv anymore. This man is an absolute legend in every sense of the word, and we need to cherish him. There won't ever be anyone else like him.   I'm glad to see everyone coming out full force to watch one of the best give the best.
Where’d you go? Outta state. You should go.
Comedy icon
BEST. EPISODE. EVERRRRR!!!!!!! I had super high expectations when I saw it was Conan. I used to tape his shows on VHS tapes so that I could watch it after school (you can guess that was a very long time ago) and I’ve been dying for him to be on hot ones for years and now that it’s finally happened he has gone far and BEYOND anything I could have ever hoped or dreamed the episode could be! Wildly chaotic and genuinely hilarious. CONAN IS A COMEDIC GENIUS AND LEGEND!!! 🔥🔥🔥 TEAM COCO ALL THE WAY!!!
He absolutely looked like Jack N when he came through that door! That was MANIC AF 💚🖤❤️ He was Amazing
Conan has a future eating ghost peppers on Tik Tok
Conan is Da Bomb
Best hot ones ever
This has truly become my favorite episode!
Was every other guest on Hot Ones lying or is Conan invincible and the Spice Ruler of the Universe?!?
Ive seen 90% of these and this is by far the most I’ve laughed.
Sean you are one of the best. Keep up the great work ❤
I don't do comments, but all involved, including that 100% Irish MADMAN deserves high praise, THE HIGHEST OF PRAISES , SEE!
I've been watching Conan since I was about 7 years old. I would sneak out of bed just to watch his show late night. I'm 33 now. I was laughing the whole time but after 23 minutes I started tearing up because I know that this man won't be here forever. This man's a legend. Great show guys! Thank you.
Conan. Is. Funny. The End.
I grew up on Conan, starting with his very first episode of Late Night and every show since. This man has shaped my comic world.  It's insane that he still looks the same and as funny as ever.
What a god-tier episode.
New standard set
I can't breathe HAHAHAHAHAHA
That suede jacket Sean is wearing is beautiful
This is greatest hot ones ever
For the...LOVE OF GOD..I hope there's footage somewhere of that water buffalo incident.  I need to see it.
Conan. Sean.  We are all having a moment.
Man conan really didn't chicken out
No one will EVER top Conan.. best episode by lightyears!!!
Conan is incredible! I would definitely shed multiple tears should I get the honor of meeting the Cone Zone. Here's to you Coco!
I knew this would be a great episode always love Conan
GOAT
I can attest that what Conan said is true. I saw him and that water buffalo having lunch at Bestia last week. Looked like they were good friends.
Conan is a living legend.... and this was amazing.
All time BEST. Conan The GOAT
🤣🤣🤣 insane
That was a masterclass in comedic performance.
Conan is the best talk show host ever
BEST EPISODE EVER!
Sean was like. Nooooo. I don't want to add anymore sauce.
Need a Sona reaction video!!
Conan was my spirit animal. Now I must find another because he is too legendary
Sean got a personal taping of an unhinged Conan comedy special!
“Youre not a doctor are you?” “I should be”
Most favorite talk show host of all time. Always thought he was funnier than Leno.
HE IS THE BEST
these are the biggest lips i've ever seen on conan
One for the books!
THIS IS THE BEST INTERVIEW EVER RECORDED
So did Conan puke back stage????
This is officially my favorite episode of Hot Ones
CONAN - FIVE OUT OF FIVE STARS
Such a benevolent guest
This was the funniest hot ones  ever
Sean needs to give Conan more props. The man didn't stutter ONCE consuming more Da Bomb than any other guest
God some of my favorite memories growing was staying up late with my parents and watching Conan, I’m glad he hasn’t lost a step
Sweet Jesus...   You had me yelling at the TV!  Nice job, both of you!  Home run finale!
Someone pinch me. This is hot ones bucket list right here
Top 3 episode. This, Gordon Ramsay, and Andrew Zimmern.
It was so nice of Conan to invite Sean Evans onto the show, what a legend!
Absolute epic madness. This may be the only Hot Ones I've ever actually watched all the way through, no skips. Conan is the king. RIP to his intestines.
Ctfu yes!!!!
Cooooooonnnnnnaaaaaannnnnddddddoooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I feel they have replaced the sauces in Conan's table with colourful water so he can be that crazy around the mighty Bomb beyond!!!
LEGEND xD
can't. stop. laughing...incredible way to close it out Hot Ones!!
Growing up I would sit in front of the tv with my eyes glued on Conan from beginning to end of each episode, and he’s still killing me 16 years later ❤
Instant classic. Conan is a legend
Only Liberace has had HAIR more flamboyant than Conan.
Conan is a national treasure who is committed to his craft!
Dr. Arroyo reminds me of Dr. Leo Spaceman. ❤
Just heard about this in a you tube short.I gotta say this interview is going to be fire..Top 10 if not #1 as far as views quickest😮 4 sure.Edit that was incredible 😊
I peed my pants. Thank you, Conan.
THANK YOU CONAN!!!!!! WE ALL HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
This episode will never be topped 🤣
I just thank god that is know this is release on at least a few day delay or else I would be looking out for news of Conan’s death
Don't Hang yourself like Bourdain!!! Please
havent watched hot ones in forever but i absolutely have to when its conan
Honest question: is Conan on coke here?
what a nut bar! haha
Conan is a comedy genius! 😂
1- David Letterman 2- Conan O’Brian 3- Jay Leno 4- Craig Ferguson  That’s it!!!  The new guys are weak, pathetic, and boring. The so political that they don’t do comedy anymore. They are instruments for the new world order socialist agenda.
Conan hates Jay
Aight. I'm about to shut it down. I agree that Conan's was the best ever...no question. The ONLY person who can rival this.......Jim. Carrey
Conan was so funny in his new movie
CONAN!!! LETS GOOO!
How is he actually more unhinged than Eric Andre?!
Him the next day 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
I have been out of college for 10 years but I feel like I need to go back just so I can write a dissertation about this episode.
I have not laughed that hard in so long omfg
Not you lying to Shakira about her being the last episode of the season 💀
Man, Conan is a Legend! His skit from Korea is highly recommended. This is guy can make anything funny 😂
This was the greatest episode of hot ones ever
What an absolute treat to see a professional entertainer who is committed to his craft. I have watched every episode and have to say this is probably the one that made me kid giggle the most. It's also fun to watch when Sean is surprised with the guest's actions. As always,  great interview!
this mf'er drinking it hahaha, i love me some co-co
This is an all-timer.
Best episode ever!
Conan is High AF 😂😂😂💪💪🇺🇸
Wait I thought Shakira closed oit Season 23?   Did you lie to her? To us?  😂
Buddy basically drank the bomb sauce. Wow! My guts are burning just thinking about it.
HILARIOUS!!!!! I had to sit down and deliberately contemplate the question "Was this the best episode yet?"
Best Hot One’s episode ever! All hail the master of late night!!!
I can't believe he just took a shot of Pepper X extract. Godayum
The goat
"was it a four year degree?"  "it was supposed to be."   Brilliant.
Conan is the comedy Juggernaut! The man can't be stopped
This is gold...
Conan is now my favorite guest sorry Gordon Ramsay
Can we please get a health update on him? Frfr Conan the GOAT. I was screaming in pain for him. Literally.  I can’t believe it’s such a cerebral interview bc of the insanity. Tied with the Paul Rudd interview. But Conan tipped everyone on the beast level achieved.
Good God.
🔥❤
I think we can all agree this is the best episode EVER!!!
Hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂
Conan definitely snorted a few lines before this interview!
I hope Conan does his show in the morning from the bathroom..
Any other guest they be warned not to touch their eyes and hes rubbing it on his face maniac
conan is an absolute legend
Conan is the Late Night GOAT!!!! And America knows it 💪😎🇺🇸
I thought Jenna Orgeta and Kristen Bell killed it...No1 is beating Conan at whatever he just did. Conan is the new God of Hot Ones!
He deserved the milk 👏
So funny!
I Usually watch these in the morning but for Conan, I’m watching it Late at Night.
Top 3 episode ever. Maybe the best. Legendary.
Hands down the best episode ever. And i haven't even pressed play yet.
THE BEST
Man I hope he drank pepto before the episode, or tomorrow is gonna hurt.
THE BEST EVER!
Conan should be on top of that list that one fan made
Conan is truly a comedic genius
Love the show, but if they stop now they'd end on the highest high possible.
Frank Zappa would have loved this.
Epic!
how can u not love Conan O'Brien !gonna watch some of his old classics after this! like him and jordan schlansky they always make me laugh!!!!
The end had me laughing so hard!!!  Great episode!
"I don't fear your wings man"
Best hot ones ever!
“I said it and Gandhi said it..and Popeye”
I have been watching for years! The best episode yet!
so much good stuff in this, but keeping the leftover wings in his pocket was my favorite bit.
What a legend!!! 🫡
Conan destroyed this challenge lol
Holy Christ ! Conan is an absolute legend !
Best Hot Ones ever.
Conan is insane. 😁
Phenomenal, all-time favorite episode that I doubt will ever be topped! So happy to see Sean get complimented by Conan too. Terry Seattle's sloppy jalapenjoes hot sauce antics trained Conan well!
🎉🎉Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me - John 14:6. Jesus is on His way back, let's use this time to get to know Him 🫶🏾🫶🏾
“Can I keep these?” Absolutely insane  behavior !!! 😂😂
The ONLY thing that would make this better is if Sona was there
Just started the video and really hope we find out if Jordan is real or scripted
Of course this was one of the best ever. Pure delivery. One of the funniest men alive.
He gonna get a DUI of hot sauce
Can we please get David Lee Roth?
I found myself screaming NO CONAN!!! at the screen one minute and dying laughing the next. I've been thoroughly entertained by Conan, again. What a living legend.
One of the few late night hosts that can be funny without a teleprompter, writers and an audience laughing like hyenas.
Conan always has me crying 😭
Complete attention seeking clown
WE LOVE YOU CONAN!
Aaaa before watching I know this will be the best episode of the show!!! So excited
Best one yet.
22:50 Conan's face even more messy. This is epic.
That cannot be real hot sauce he’s drinking🤣 Conan, you outperformed our expectations. Wildly entertaining.
I didnt think it was possible to have more respect for Conan O'Brien but it just keeps growing.
Did anyone hear Sean say "Careful around the eyes"? I gotta think he didn't cause he knew Conan would take it as a challenge lol! Best episode to date.
Conan is pure comedy and professionalism!!! Amazing episode
this was one of the funniest interview ever lol
Conan is going to need a new diaper for sure!
Conan being comfortable in his skin and nailing this interview has to be the most soothing thing to watch out there
About time we get a guest that isn't some no talent social media influencer lol
Sometimes you just witness comedic gold
I've been watching for years and never commented, the bar has been officially raised.
I love Conan but I need my Dr.Arroyo time stamps😂
Give this man his flowers now. One of the best talk show hosts and entertainers of our time! Long live Conan
OH……………MY…………………………………….GOD
Man....how is this so motivational?😂😂😂😂😂
One of best guests of ever
What did I just witness😮
I love the look of concern he has in his eyes for Conan after he drank it ❤
THE BEST EPISODE EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
Conan obrien!!!!!!!!!!
When I tell you I was GAGGED when Conan licked Da Bomb 🥵
Felt like Conan was the host lol nice
Conan may be not only the craziest guest ever, but also possibly the toughest. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY has ever went that far with the sauce! And at the outro, he looked like he had been through something. Conan always steals the show, no matter what it is.
As I see it, there are two takeaways for Sean here--(1. he was rightfully recognized as a great interviewer who may have outgrown the kitsch of interviewing people while subjecting them to decidedly offensive condiments (2. this episode was the full Bodhi of this concept, and can never be bested. Ergo it may be  time to drop the hot sauce and just do the interviews without the props. This was a f-ing masterpiece.
Legend
I put chicken wings in my pockets too😅!
Conan = Great Entertainment. It’s simple as that. GOAT
CONAN really did amazing…. Like watching him was entertaining and funny as can be.  genuinely going to go watch his show now due to his amazing delivery here. He sold it PERFECTLY
Best episode ever,
The best episode ever!!!!
There will never be another Conan!! Wouldnt expect anything less from him. Dude just became the first to beat Hot Ones 😂🔥
Finally!! Someone that actually eats the wings, not just a nibble or two!!
Well, good luck trying to beat that to anyone in the future 🤯
Putting the wings in his pocket 😂😂😂😂😂
Consn It's the best!! What a performance 😂
❤🍗❤🍗❤🍗❤🍗❤🍗❤🍗CONAN O'BRIEN!!!!!!!!!  ❤🍗❤🍗❤🍗❤🍗❤🍗❤🍗❤🍗
Nobody will ever be able to top THIS! 😂
Wow great ep, Conan's insides will be 80 now haha great work guys
THANK YOU CONAN, Jesus Christ I always said the same thing about Warren G Hardin. And I'm from Ohio. Matter fact some Big Oil Suits had to convince him to even run, simply because he looked like a president. Aka they were going to use their money to influence his law making decisions..
Love Conan and is this is the best 🙌🤣
Just delete the coco spice episode after this.
Conan deserves a standing ovation for that plug. So much chaos but I know that he was on the show to promote Conan Must Go on Max lol. Oh my god I haven't laughed that hard in a minute.
Not me home alone giving Conan and Sean a standing ovation 😂😂 that was the best hot ones yet
I never make a comment on any video. I've watched First We Feast since season 1, and I've never laughed this hard ever. Conan is the true king of late night, great way to end the season!
This is so unhinged. Just as expected. Perfection
Best Ep ?
I was expecting that, every time he finished off a wing, Conan would put it in his pocket and say, "thanks for having me".
I've been a fan from day 1....I live in a country that idolizes pepper and hot sauce (Trinidad). I used to watch religiously but the show started getting predictable.   Conan just brought it back in 1 episode. Best Episode in the few seasons by a landslide !!!  Sean....."he's the guest the show deserves but not the one that's needed right now. So we will hunt him, because he can take it".....Jim Gordon
The best to ever do it! Conan's now my God.
I'm so happy seeing this title
Hands down one of the Funniest Men ever... Love Conan.
Conan carried late nite tv talk shows my whole childhood
We Gingers gotta stick together!!!
"Can I get a pulse?"... "It's there"
Conan is an perfect end of the season. Made me cry laugh 🤘🤘🤘
Conan and Craig Ferguson are my favorite late night hosts, they were consistently funny and entertaining unlike the others. Conan is genuinely hilarious and intelligent, and it shows. This episode was fantastic, his bits were so funny 😂
Conan is the next Gary Busey!
OMFG that was a wild ride!
I fucken love Conan
I have not a doubt in my mind that he was actually in incredible pain the whole time and just pushed through it because he's the GOAT
Ok how how much did Conan have to pay to bribe someone to sneak in and replace all the sauces with ketchup?  lol!
This is it! This is the one! This is the greatest episode of Hot Ones. Ever!!   I was literally crying while watching this. I haven't laughed this hard in a while. Conan is the Hot Ones GOAT!!!
I was giggling so hard at this that my husband came to check on me from the other room out of genuine concern! 😂 😭 🤣
You gotta commit to the bit...IT'S NOT A BIT, THIS IS LIFE, THIS IS A BIT TO YOU?!?!
he made anyone who bailed during hot wings challenge look like a little anorexic school girl.
This is nothing less than a full masterclass of comedy. This proves why Conan is the absolute GOAT.
an absolutely perfect Curly Howard sound. no notes.
Conan O'Brian as Joker
Best episode so far 100% Conan is kind of a legend
Wildest guest on this show. You wouldn’t see me drinking that hot sauce bottle. Conan is the BEST!!!
What a man, what a man indeed.
This is the new bar for anyone to be measured to. Conan is a madman. 🤣💙
Legendary episode from the king of comedy!
Conan I love so much.
This is by far the most unhinged episode of Hot Ones I've ever seen, which is all of them. Bravo.
That doctor was so so funny 😂
Best guest, of all the years.
Legend.
Must've been nice for Sean to get his flowers Conan went full savage  I'm in awe of his powers
Conan just raised the bar, turned it up to 11, and invented "The Wing Drop". Legend! 🤘🤘
I mean if people don’t watch this show now!!!!
17:00 I love how messy Conan's mouth got lol
waste of time
Best episode I’ve ever seen
It’s funny cause.. when Donna ramps up his character, it’s the heat yelling thru!
Where's Jordan! Do Jordan Schlansky next!! Conan is King!!! 👑 🔥 🔥 🔥
"I dont fear your wings man"... He in fact did not fear them. Taking shots of the sauce, pooring extra Da Bomb and licking it. His last dab was a combo of the last 4 sauces.
"not good" 😂
Jesus Christ!  1.3M views in only 10 hours??  That's gotta be some record speed growth.  Shakira has 1.5M and that was a full week ago.
This is the greatest thing on the internet right now.  Conan is a legend.
THE BEST EPISODE!!!!!!!!!!
Eh
Conan is the master of Unpredictability .  Even Sean was stunned and out of words on what's happening right across of him.
Best episode ever! The end! What a legend 👏👏👏
last true comic what a legend
“COME ON MAN ARE WE DOING THIS OR NOT?! WHAT’S THE POINT OF EVEN BEING ALIVE IF WE CAN’T DO THIS?!” 😭🥹😂
Conan is the GOAT
Hands down, best guest to date. Well done.
Conan puts on a Masterclass in entertainment.
Conan won this whole show 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
God I love this man!!!
Weird Al<————>Conan
Best. Episode. Ever
This is how God pre-games.
Now that's hot sauce
Conan understood the assignment 100%
what is wrong with this guy
Best episode ever!!
Conan low key got covid, lost his taste then went to on the show to flame us all
Hands down, best episode ever. We love you Conan!!
without a doubt the best ep ever!!
Legend
I'm trying so hard not to explode in laughter in the office right now.
The wings had him channeling Lewis Black
Nothing will top this episode.
Conan is a savage, Great interview
Conan is a gem
The best episode in a LONG time. Love this guy
Last dab? What last dab!? Hahahahahahaha!!  Watching this while driving is a mistake. Now I realize I cannot drive and laugh so hard at the same time. I have to stop on the side to laugh this hard!
ah, desperately overrated humorist Conan O'Brien
I'd have to day...this was one of the Best...I wanna watch Conans show 😂
Unhinged
Conan complimenting Sean has to be the happiest I’ve been for another human being in my entire life. You made it bro!
Why did I not automatically assume that a hot ones episode with conan would go off the rails when you least expect it
I seemed to have missed the fact that Conan is absolutely insane. Until now, of course.
Never laughed so hard at one of these. Well done!
A true American hero! God bless Conan O'Brien 🙌🙌🙌
I can very easily say that no guest will ever top this
i wish this wasnt hd
In the pocket 🎉🎉🎉
YESSS! CONAN!!!
This might have just possibly uncrowned Kevin Hart as the best episode of all time....
😂 ...like eating whip cream on a warm summer day...
I just witnessed the all time greatest episode of Hot Ones.
I know them tinny lips are burning 😂😂😂😂
Greatest hot ones episode yet. We just had to go through 3 duds first.
I would love to see Conan do a podcast like Tosh just with actual famous people.
"Did you ever know that your my hero"
Excellent show, Pure professionalism on both sides, and Conan redefining the rules when it comes to how to drink your hot sauce! Loved it all best jokes I've heard in a while!
This is Beautiful
He’s like watching a three year old in their high chair eating a bowl of spaghetti.
By far, the best episode ever. The fear in Sean's eyes for Conan's well being is absolutely priceless. Hoping Conan is doing okay
Coco is a tank!
BEST EPISODE OF HOT ONES EVER.
Out of state lol
This might be the best one ever.
No one can top Conan after this episode. Legend!
Honestly one of the funniest episodes ever. I’ve never laughed like this
Wow!
This is definitely in the top 3 if not the best interview ever!!! Much respect to Conan!
This is the FUNNIEST one yet!!!😂😂😂 I love Conan!
Just flipping chaos 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jesus H. Christ, what a show. Who knew Conan was this unhinged???
I got to meet Conan once at a charity auction for a theater company in New York. I had introduced myself as a fan and was chatting with him about his suit when the lights went down and everyone looked to the front of the room for the auction winner announcements. I turned around and had just assumed that Conan walked away but right as the room got quiet, he whispered in my ear from behind "this is when they decide who lives and who dies." and I erupted into laughter in the middle of an otherwise silent room.
Jesus, Conan looks like a transvestite up close.😂
Doctor check for pulse "It's there"  🤣🤣
I love this man 😂❤. I wish him a long and healthy life ❤❤❤❤
Liked before watching.  I'm confident.
Conan is one of the best ever to be on television.
Conan is an absolute living legend.
Conan is a beast! And dead inside.
Simply the best!! Way to go Conan
All the late night talk show hosts need to learn from Conan
Conan is the best 😂
Warren G Harding is a wild president 😂😂 yo done gave the job up 😂😂. Shout out Conan dropping history lessons and simultaneously drinking hot sauce
how did he do that?
The only thing better than this would be Conan bringing Jordan Schlansky to hot ones, as his psychedelic babysitter.
Best episode! Conan is the legend!
This man is a mad genius lol what did I just watch 😂
I think Conan legitimately lost his mind here and I love it. 😂😂😂😂
“In the year 2 thousand!!”  Was my era
You’re an Ollie to manual!!! Oh!!! ……    …❤ ya, Eric! That was rad.
Have loved Conan since watching Late Night as a kid.  He went so hard for Hot ones, what a amazing way to end a season.👏🏽🙌🏽🙏🏼
He goes pink, and after a bit he's really pink, and then he becomes REALLY pink, like a base latex paint color of pink!
All-timer of an episode. Conan is seriously one of the most naturally funny people I’ve ever witnessed. Across TV, movies, comedy, YouTube, whatever. Just an absolute legend.
This is hands down the best episode yet. Conan is King!
Best episode ever
I miss this man hosting a late night talk show so much.
Conan 😂
There is something deeply wrong with this man and I love him all the more for it 20:57
I adore this man more than most things
Anybody check on Coolio in a minute?
From being a raving madman on network TV, to being a raving madman on cable TV, to being a raving madman on the internet, the trajectory of Conan's career has been a thing that happened.
Even though I’m biased, I’d say that was perhaps the best Hot Ones episode ever. Conan really reminded us why he’s the best.
Conan is the fxcking Hot Ones GOAT 🎉
How can this ever be topped?
Legend.
who knew the whitest Irish man alive would be the most fearless when it comes to spice.
Conan: "Was it a 4 year college?" Dr. Arroyo "It was suppose to be..." *Walks away* 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣/5
Conan shat his pants after that
I’m genuinely so scared and uncomfortable
OMFG!!!!!! CONANNNNNNNNNNN ISSSS TTHEEE KIINNNGGGGGG
Best episode ever. Legend!
Conan is a national treasure
Whenever somebody talks about Max, I always think Cinemax.
Can we get a wellness report on Conan? I've never seen such a chaotic episode, way to close out the season! Haha
Who's this Conan guy?
A potato doesn't feel pain
Conan clearly coated his mouth with wax.
Ladies and gentleman, an Aries.
This was the best hot ones show ever
In the year two thousand!!!!!
YES!
Best. Hot Ones. Ever!
BEST GUEST EVER!!!!!!
The whole concept of the show is that the hot wings break through the media training facade of the guests but it could not break the professionalism of that guy. It does seem like it broke through emotionally though because that moment at the end seemed real. He is doing some absolutely crazy stuff to desperately try and connect with an audience 50 years younger than him. As I live outside the US I knew who he was but was not intimately familiar. He has earned my respect on so many levels with this. He is the real deal.
The best talk show host to ever live… Conan is literally one in a few billion. Best to ever do it.. and always the smartest, funniest dude in the room.
I guess they didn't watch murderville. This is child's play for Conan.
Conan is the GOAT
I can't wait to hear Sona's reaction.
Oh look, we got Conan finally! Conan: BWAGHWAHASHAS DASHDASDASDA!!! In full ferality. YUS.
I mean, is there a point of doing any more shows? This is it. This is gold. Its a perfect episode 😂
Conan is the GOAT!!!
Well done for the season finale! Conan is King of Hot Ones 🔥🥵.
We all need a doctor. We all have eternal life. The question is where will you spend it. Jesus died on the cross for you. He who hears my word (JESUS) and believes in Him (GOD) who sent me will have eternal life! He will not be condemned, he has crossed over from death to life. John 5:24
Conan on Hot Ones might be the greatest moment in the history of television
No one, and I mean one one did it better!!!!!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Shock and awe
Sean saying Oh my God and hearing him hitting the table laughing off screen because of Conan's antics can never be seen on other episodes. Imma watch this on repeat until it hit 100M!
Did... did Conan die?
Conans secret is that hes always in a constant state of horrifying pain.
Finally, a sauce warrior 😂😂
Conan is the king
amazing
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The fear in Sean’s eyes
By far the craziest wildest episode
top 5 hot ones episodes and the rant at the end probably numero uno.
Aw I wish Conan was the lead in Late night with the devil.
Conan is on a Mozart level of comedy. The man is always clicking shots after shots and still going strong 💪
After watching this, I thought, “His older brother Neil must be a monster.” 😂 conan was forged in the fires of growing up a middle child who could show no weakness or else he’d starve.
“Letterman and the other guy” 😂
This guy makes Steve-O seem normal 🤣
Conan is the 🐐
I love Conan😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
Conan’s a redhead. I know from experience with my daughter that they can be superhuman when it comes to pain and other things. Conan is the best. Love him. Best hot wings show ever
The pocket joke doesn’t get old lol
Legend
I feel attacked that he said my name like that
Conan killed it.
Ahhhh Conan... What a timeless legend. ❤
As a massive Conan fan Im biased but best episode ever! Conan really sold out lol what a finish to the season! What a maniac lol there's no way his guy wasn't hurting after that. And Sean with the high praise on his interview skills. Impressive!
This was so good. I loved it 🔥😁
legendary
Amazing how Conan manages to add a sketch in the middle of the interview without ruining it's pacing, not 1 but 7 times
been watching for a long time and i dont think anyone can top what conan just did. what an animal
One of the best Hot Ones ever!
I'm just here to say that jacket he's wearing is dope af
Love Conan.. but for some reason this episode really made me wish there could have been a Chris Farley episode
Absolutely amazing
This has been the best guest on Hot Ones ever. Conan loves where he's at.. He has earned it.  So funny!
I’m to high for this 😂
🤔
Conan is an insane genius...the GOAT!
ALL HAIL! A true and undeniable SPICE LORD! Long live Sir CONAN THE MAGNIFICENT!
Such a good episode!!!
Amazing😂
COMMIT TO THE BIT
He made this show complete chaos. I love it.
best one ever...
ok but now I need to watch a video of Sona and Matt reacting to this
“The other guy”  Perfect.
The last half of this episode I was basically doing an increasingly concerned impression of Andy Richter while Conan climbed onto that water buffalo - “No, Conan, don’t do that! It’s Da Bomb! It killed Coolio!”
All the comments "awe look, Conan finally got on the show".. Conan : ABSOLUTE FERAL !
this was as insane and hilarious as i expected it to be. conan always keels me over
Conan's Hot Ones interview is the POLAR OPPOSITE of DJ Khalid's interview and I'm 110% here for it
Dear Conan Sir. Can I have the jacket I am hungry and need some chicken
dude is obviously sick
He’s done it he’s the best hot ones guest ever😂
One of the greatest episodes of Hot Ones EVER! What a legend!
Conan is an absolute LEGEND  His brand of comedy: the physical, the set bits,  the subtle  is why ive always loved him.  Amazing interview Sean
Conan is by far the most beast guest EVER!!!
Conan 💯🤣
King Iso!
This might be in top 3 ever
I don't think nobody will ever up this. I was here 04/11/2024 punch your tickets down below my fellow watchers. We are apart of history!! We love you Sir Conan O'Brien
Anthropologocal !  Anthony Bourdain!  No I feel it's the experience and a deep rooted knack for it when it's about Anthony. It's very real and so is still relevant and engaging. Who needs the study!
Is Conan going to die? 😂
He already cries before finishing the first wing. I mean I would die under the table when the doctor came 🤣
Conan is a true monster and pure genius!
Funniest Hot Ones I've ever seen....Conan is a legend
Epic interview 😊
This is the best!! 😂
It's silly to be reading questions from a prompter, and trying to make it seem natural.   Just don't.
Best one I’ve seen.
Phenomenal!😂
Regular Show when Benson eats hot wings is basically Conan O'Brien 21:00
This man literally rubbed MEGA amounts of hot sauce in his hands and FACE!!! he’s the goated episode
24:58 conan channeling season 1 rick sanchez closing monologue
This is definitely the best episode of this show I've ever seen..😬😬
The commitment to the poket bit is pure Conan. Double down and double down😂😂so funny
Conan the goat
Conan is simply the best ever. He goes onto hot ones and instantly makes it the best hot ones episode ever.
Wing drop lol, this was legendary.
I hope everyone appreciates Conan. I mean look at the current late night hosts...
Conan looks like Heatmiser.
I actually cried laughing several times
best episode ever no surprise!
This was uh… something 😅
This was incredible!
CONAN!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭 I'm actually worried for his health rn, but dude took those like a champ. 💪
🫅🏼 crown him folks.....new #1!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Without a doubt my favorite late night host and favorite hot ones so far
Conan will go down as one of the greatest hosts and entertainers of all time. There is something special about that man nobody can emulate.
😂
it's all downhill from here. that was incredible.
holy cows the laughs came out on that one, couldn't keep em in- bravo Conan
This is by far my favourite episode ever!
Conan!  The best!
Conan is the man
Heck yeah
Not what I was expecting.  Super funny!
Conan is so chaotic hahahahahah  This was way funnier than what i expected 😭😭😭
This is the most glorious video ever posted on this channel 👑
Dude, this is nuts. He's like Rodney Dangerfield if he was an action/hot sauce eating star. So badass!
Man went from pale white to as red as a fire truck lol
this was the funniest episode of hot ones i've seen 😂
We have ALL just witnessed a HISTORIC hot one's episode...I would argue one of the BEST guests EVER!!!!!
An American treasure. This has to go down as one of the best episodes ever! I’m dying.
Geez, bow down to the King. Conan O'Brien everyone!
This episode is gonna break Hot Ones records.
Jordan Schlansky as a guest next please!
This was the best episode of hot ones ever
Single greatest episode, ever. For all time.
Best one in years hahahaha
Loved this episode! You know there are plenty of memes to be made from this. But what I really want to point out is how scared Sean looked at certain parts. Rightly so.
By far the best episode of Hot Ones ever
Always great to see Conan
Finally a decent guest, jeez..
Did he take a numbing pill before this dangggggg
That was amazing!
wow a celebrity that i actually know of and love. that barely happens with this channel
Conan is unreal man 🤣 when he poured Da Bomb out on that wing I dropped my iPad in shock 😮
I love you Conan
*WHAT A MANIAC! AND WE LOVE HIM FOR IT!*
Conan dominated but he'll remember this in the morning 🚽🔥
This was the best one yet!
Epic     🎬
While I was never a big fan of Conan on his late night shows, he is a funny guy and this was a superb episode and interview.
Best ever!!!
After seeing Conan get pranked with hot sauce on Murderville, this really isn't how I thought this episode would go down!
Beast mode Conan! Craziest guest yet! I love it! 😂
What an entertainer. Conan is the best. As a 90s kid, i'm proud to have watched late night live with him over the last 28 years of my life. The best late night host ever.
The best hot ones episode ever. That was legendary!
The best EVER!
As a foreigner, just slightly aware about Conan's aura. At first, not gonna lie, I felt a bit dubious. Like : this can't be real, it must have been staged and so. But now that I've seen the whole episode, I have to say that the man built a bit of respect toward him and also to my perceptions of things. Mad Lad at the least. In a good way.
Oh my gods Conan is insane...it's why we love him.
what's the matter with me, why can't i FEEL???         legend
There is nothing I want more than a reaction video with Sona and Matt.
I recognize that guy who played his "doctor" 😂, he has been in some of Conan's skits.
At the start, I said to myself "That's a nice jacket Conan is wearing". Then he started giving me anxiety when he started stuffing wings in the pockets.
wow conan looks like hes gotten about 5 minutes of sun at the end here
This is officially the best video on the internet
Best guest ever
BEST EPISODE EVER. ACCEPT GROHL !
he who controls the spice controls the universe
Only one i watched from this season and probably the best of all time Im lol'n and loving it
It’s great to spend my time with my 13 year old and both agree that THIS was peak entertainment.  What am episode and we can confidently say, this with the best.
Why is he saving the bones😂😂😂
This is my favorite episode ever.
Conan is insane
He might go down as the GOAT guest 😂💀💀
Conan is one of the 🐐 's . They don't make em like that anymore.
OH MY GOD! Conan is INSANE!
May have been my favorite episode so far!
I was absolutely looking forward to this knowing it would be funny but I never thought Conan was going to beast mode this the way he did.
Conan is king!
I enjoy these 2 guys talking, they should do it more often. wow
OK. But next time can Conan get some spicy wings?
Somewhere out there Ed Currie gave a little golf clap
He must have Botox in his mouth.
Just more proof that Conan is the goat
The episode I never knew I needed lol.
Conan will be pooping fire for a week
Fantastic!
Fact: the doctor here is one of his all time producers. Wild wild episode 😂😂
😂😂😂OMFG. ROFL..
😂 that was one of the best ones I have seen ❤
I'm so stoked for Conan's new show. His remote segments from Late Night was my favorite part of television ever.
This, this right here, this is the absolute epitomy of Hot Ones
I'm not the one eating the wings, but I already feel like having explosive diarrhea as I watch this.
Conan fans, we're loving this!
Conan outdid literally everyone ever on this show. Brilliant as interviewee  and comedian.
I respect Da Bomb 🤣🤣
"I said it and Gandhi said it" 😂
I haven’t laughed that hard in a long time
Conan's right, Sean's a great host - But he's twenty years too early to hold his own on the stage with the grandmaster himself.
I love Conan, he’s the GOAT
As I watch in awe and abject horror, just leaving the comment to please check on Conan, tomorrow, Sunday, and all throughout the week next week. Dr. Arroyo, please be diligent!
beautiful
This should be the last episode of hot ones. They should end the show on its highest note ever.
Simply the best to do it.
Conan is a national treasure
conan def used to do coke
I didn't know that I share a birthday with Conan ❤🎉
Someone check on Conan...did he recover 😂
CONAN NOOO!!
GREASTEST EPISODE EVER!!!!!!
Conan is so funny! Loved watching this!
That was gross. Conan tries too hard to be funny an often fails
For years I called Conan…. Conehead 😂😂😂
Genuinely curious how his recovery is going🥵
Ive never seen dude scared before. Legit fear in his eyes
Did Conan drank some candles before like that Simpsons episode? He crushed all these wings.
WOW 😂😂😂😂😂 Conan has officially become the best guest that has ever been on hot ones
This was an awesome ending
Conan is insane lol
This is the best video ever
Wow.. 20 years later he wants to be Jim Carrey.
greatest episode ever . great work
ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS!!!!  Oh wow!  I got tears from this.  Way to go Conan!
Can we make him be the President??
incredible. top 5 ep.
We’ve all seen DA BOMB crush lesser guests  I’m floored by Conan’s fearlessness🔥
Been rocking with Conan for 20 years! Salute!
I'm starting to think Dr. Arroyo isn't a real doctor
😂😂😂 Conan is a beast!
Conan has the best energy throughout the whole interview
"The other guy" is the most recognition that Leno deserves
I just keep watching it over and over. This is the best episode of the show period.
As he's dabbing on the bomb my husband points out that its that same level of tomfoolery that got him in trouble in the water buffalo story he told five seconds before.
Conan deserved that with the water Buffalo for being disrespectful to animals
One of the great Hot Ones episodes. Thank you
Conan is the man unbelievable
All hail the king of hot ones, Conan the hot wings destroyer
Best episode of all time. Hands down.
Conan has always been that dude, glad he is still making us laugh!
Comedy genius
That was the hardest I have laughed and cried at the same time in over 10 years. Than was funny man! That was epic comedy! Bravo  🙌🏻
It’s giving Rick 😂
My favourite celebrity ❤
My absolute favorite part is when Conan shoves the eaten wings into his pocket! 🤣🤣
Conan is the king!
Best Da Bomb ever
Conan we love you so much 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 this man has me dieing
Best. Episode. Ever. I’m absolutely floored that Conan took Da Bomb like it didn’t exist.  Now his lower intestines are going to take awhile to return to norm
Conan yelling "I'M FINE!" Will be my forever mood.
Well that was the funniest episode of this show ever.
GOATy
Conan reigns supreme, as always.
WOW what a closing act for this season! Team Coco forever!
This is incredible
Mad Man. Respect.. lol
That was unhinged! And I loved it! Way to go out!
This is the best episode by far
Best one yet - not even close
The only thing topping this is if someone combines all the sauces at once because this was UNHINGED
Love that jacket, he is a lunatic for putting his bones in the pocket. 😭😭
Hitting Lewis Black levels at the end there.
He sounds like Shake
I was expecting funny but I wasn't expecting it to make my entire year better god that was good.
He never disappoints 🥰🥰😂😂😂
You wanted to break people into getting the real them in this show and little did you know, there's no breaking the Cone Zone.
i would watch a show titled "Conan Unchained" after seeing this
Most impressive Hot Ones performance to date. Definitely largest quantity of hot sauce.
Cool
I think we have a Gordon Ramsey episode contender. Totally EPIC.
Rest in peace Orenthal James Simpson
THE best!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
A f’ing plus!
Can't find the part where he tries da bomb. Thanks to every employee for making me blindly search for it to no avail! Unsubscribed!
Best video on the internet
He went all in . I don't know if anyone went so hard and seemingly handled it as if nothing effected him.. his face didn't even turn red till the very end .
You should try the Elijah extreme
What a beast. I've always loved Conan and this is so fantastic. I never expected ANY guest to do it like he did.
Conan + Mucho Spicy = Rick Sanchez
A legend
God the whole episode I'm just yelling conan, Conan, CONAN, haha when he grabbed the bomb I lost it 😂
You lied to Shakira. You have lost all credibility.
Best one!!!!!!!!!
Wow that was insane
Best. Hot Ones. Ever. :)
It’s amazing what can happen when panic sets in.
Simply brilliant
Conan I missed you so much man!!! So awesome that you have a new show coming can’t wait!
Watching Conan go from pale white to beet red in the face as the show goes on is so funny
That was fantastic!
Conan is probably the last sane daily/nightly show hosts.
Yes i love Conan!!!! This is the best surprise ever I grew up on Conan and I'm 26 he got me through some of my darkest times
This episode should be in the Hall of Fame of Hot Ones episodes.
That had such a high bar to clear and he did it perfectly
This was the funniest episode in 23 seasons and Conan is the maniac of maniacs.  I can only image what he felt like a few hours later.
Of course Conan brought a bit with him to the interview 😂😂😂
And again, whether it's his own show or someone else's show, Conan is the best to ever do it. I literally just broke down in tears about how much this man means to me. He was my introduction to comedy which is now my whole life. Thank you Conan thank you so much. I've never admired anyone more.
This was hilarious😂😂😂😂
This is like live action the joker movie
I wish I could watch Conans podcast but he's being a susssy little Irishman and won't upload the full recorded videos anywhere
This is beyond anything else I've seen 😂
Conan is the comedy GOAT
Did not disappoint 😂
You got Conan!
Seeing Da Bomb slowly oozing out took me out 😭
Aside from the grand finale David Blaine performed on his episode this is my new favorite episode.
Hit like before it started. Yep. Everything but gerbils.
12:45 Did he do this after a show? He's wearing the exact same outfit in that picture lol
It is so wonderful that this uninteresting guest line up season, that no matter how amazing Sean's skills were with these guests, was able to not tank at the end and provided one of his top 20 guests and interviews of all time.  Way to go, Sean!
Coney O’Brien Must Go……I need that!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
What a legend
The  GOAT
This is the best episode of hot ones i have EVER watched.
Connan and spicy food?! Oh my god!!!
There needs to be a behind the scenes for this. Conan destroyed himself for the comedy game. He and Coolio have got to be fully out after this.
I never felt the anxiety that I felt while watching Conan drink the sauce .
This is the greatest hot ones episode of all time, right ?
Anyone know where Conan got that jacket???
Release the water Buffalo footage
Conan O Brien is officially THE HOTTEST SAWCE...EVVVAAAA!!!
NOPE, nope, nope... 2 minutes in and he just gives me the creeps. (Love ya Sean.)
Conan is a national treasure. Great job, that was fantastic entertainment!
And that's how it's done.
GOAT CONAN
Jajajajajaja
Maybe the best interview
Conan: “Can’t do a mic…but will do a wing drop!!!” 🔥 🔥 🔥
Wow!! Bravo, Conan. Bravo! Best episode ever.
Well, Conan took this to a whole nother level !! good luck topping this 😂
Conan FTW!!!
This interview, with it's superb questions (as I've become accustomed to from this show), makes me wish so hard that Conan had been on Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee with Jerry Seinfeld. It's the episode I always dearly wish had been made.
I've never seen anything so disgusting. At least wipe your mouth.
Never seen Sean laugh this much in the entirety of Hot Ones wow 😮
The Conan Kayfabe is strong in this episode.
Bro, you're interviewing one of the greatest talk show hosts of all time. What?!
GOAT episode
Hard to say but this might be my all time favorite episode
Pain is temporary a good bit is forever.
In my experience, anything with “bourbon maple” or “honey bourbon” in the name has always yielded a positive flavor experience.  I legitimately would like to try that sauce.
Bro is everywhere
Hot Ones History
What a beast!  Mad props to Conan.  There is a reason why I have always liked his show.  Keep it up
This has got to be the greatest episode of hot ones!
Absolute riot 🤣
i haven’t laughed this hard at a hot ones episode in a long time. great episode.
This is a loving legend. What a BLAST
All I could think watching this was “Narcan”. Conan needs Narcan.
The King! All praise the KING of Comedy!
This is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen
Everything Conan does is memorable plus on the money complementing Sean!!!❤️‍🔥👊
At the start: I don't think it's hit me yet, when does it hit?!  At the end: MY INTESTINES HAVE TURNED INTO ACID!!🔥🔥🔥🔥😁🔥🔥🔥🔥
the GREATEST of ALL TIME.
That was comedy gold. I laughed so loud toward the end, my family thought I was crazy. Conan is a comedic genius!
Not until this moment did I think Conan did drugs.
That ending 😂😂😂😂😂
Conan turned into Lewis Black in the end there...
Conan and "Dr. Arroyo" are hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
Hands down the best episode in Hot Ones history.
I grew up with this man. Sneaking tv at midnight when my parents thought I was asleep lol. Absolute legend.
CONAN IS THE GOAT
The best to ever do it
Best interview ever!!!! True comedy. Conan and Albert Einstein are my two biggest secret crushes. All my life! I LOVE YOU, CONAN. This is the greatest ❤
I wonder how badly he regretted some of his choices LOL
5:32 thats the first time I have heard Conan curse lol
Absolutely LEGENDARY episode!! This is truly iconic lol Conan is forever a comedic genius
Best hot ones yet!
CONAN!!!! THE GOAT🐐
Protect this man at all costs!
WHAT A F KING 💖💖💖💖💖💖
Man that was epic from wire to wire.
What did he do with the wings he stored in his pocket?
He fuggin chugged it lol
“You’re not a doctor, are you?” “I should be”
This is one of the best if not the BEST guest ever 😂😂😂 my god this guy is hilarious from the very start.
The best interview buddy
What a beast!
Wow.
Conan is a BEAST!!!!
COCO THE SPICELORD
Conan delivers.
Sean needs to go on Conan’s podcast now!
😂Conan was so good😂
time to pack it in, this is the best this show has been or will get from here on out
jesus christ, conan put steve-o to shame
Now get Craig Ferguson! Conan flew over expectations 😂
That was 1 of the best shows yet if not the best conan is the GOAT
How is Conan not the best 😂
What a king.
Best one yet Conan is a boss 🔥
This was awesome!
That got gross, but wow amazing
Easily my favorite episode ever.  Hilarious
Conan is king, to get his compliment is to be knighted.  I grew up watching him and this performance is peak Conan, I can't stop smiling.  All they did was give a writer his own show and he made himself a legend.
Pretty sure the "doctor" is an actor. I remember seeing him somewhere though cant remember where  Also starting with a sily bit is such a Conan thing to do 🤣
The best guest
Thats the real life Dr. nick!!
Conan is the only late night host I thought was genuinely funny 🌙
BEAST
Sean must have gotten clearance to talk to Conan. Poor Larry 😂
Dr arroyo so good
Nothing more honest than screaming IM FINE as loudly as possible.   Legend.
Finally, an episode I actually want to watch.
He is scared hahaha
Best, most over the top interview ever? Probably.
Conan O'Brien has set the bar.
I love Conan to death. My favorite hot ones ever. King 👑
Conan a savage
This was absolute lunacy 🤣
This is the best thing that’s happened all week!
I didn’t know it was possible to win at Hot Ones. But Conan won. He won.
This just made my favorite episode passing Dave Grohel.
I ❤ Conan
This should just be the final episode.  There is no way another guest will top this performance.
That’s it. All time greatest Hot Ones guest. Not even close.
"I"M FINEEE!!!" @23:00 had me HOLLERING!!!
I love Conan. This world doesn’t deserve him🧡💙
Invite Ronnie Radke 🖤🖤🖤
The best hotones ever!!!
Now words, just 👏 👏
The best Hosts ever in the best PROGRAM ever!!! The best screen time EVER !!!!! Only you two!
I've watched many an episode of Hot Ones, lads. This one - even without Sean's look of terror nor  Conan's nip rubs - has no English word to describe what unfolds.  What a great use of 26 minutes. Bravo.
BEST.  HOT. ONES. EVER
Top 3 all time episode for me
Okay so we all know conan is funny asf but can we just acknowledge the fact that conan is probably one of the smartest people i’ve seen like just generally… he is extremely smart and so self aware
Really thought Conan was going to pour milk over his head at the end there 😂 what a great episode!
This made me laugh cry.
Throw Conan in the Hot Ones Hall of Fame ASAP. No need for a vote. What he sacrificed for our entertainmentl could never be equated.
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!!! CONAN is the   GOAT 🐐
My God. You've put out some bangers, but, this was an absolutely amazing episode!
The man understands good TV. Greatest episode ever.
Conan, Conan, Conan ❤🎉
Conan destroyed the show! hahahah
Ok. so i sometimes feel like i start sweating just watching the show. Watching Conan do the finger licking with the Last Dab LITERALLY made the tip of my tongue feel like it was burning!
FINALLY FINALLY!!!!! A WORTHY GUEST! We need more brainy guests!
Conan Obrien always delivers he is the best
They don't build 'em like this anymore! This is officially my favorite episode
The wings set Conan's hair on fire
Right before he dies, right at the end… This Irish hero is referring the Bible , and comedy. 😂😂😂😂😂 Go Conan O’Brien 💪🏽 this is a testimony of your brilliant career. The best ever.  It’s a performance to be taught in comedy school 🤓🤩
Conan is the man! I love this dude
One of the best Episodes ever.
I’ve personally bought and tasted da bomb. This man is the liquid terminator.
Conan didn't seem to realize that there is a "tomorrow" after a night of extreme hot sauce drinking.
HAHAHHAHA... now this is content 21:00
YOOO what did I watch 😂😂
I haven’t laughed so much in a while!
Going into this video, I just knew that Conan was going to destroy the gauntlet and he didn't disappoint. The man is a legend and a national treasure.
Conan didn't crush it he demolished it, noone will ever match it!
Would love to see Jordan Schlansky on Hot Ones
Dr Arroyo MUST be a permanent part of the show!
Conan is DA MAN a madman. LEGENDARY LEGEND. Best wing episode EVER.
Any media with Conan is a gift.
Jesus Christ
Totally off the rails.😂😂 Best one this season!
Sean and all of you at hot ones as usual did a great job. I have to say Conan O'Brien has been one of the most entertaining guests you guys have had on in a long time. There were four or five times where I said out loud. Oh no! Fantastic show! Great way to end the season!
Him handling spice like this had me whispering Lisan al-Gaib in reverence
that, was.... Incredible!!
DORIYAHHH
Conan turned HotOnes into one of his own remote sketches... incredible
This is probably the most legendary hot ones episode I've ever seen. This man destroyed it.
Conan getting fired from the tonight show may have been the best outcome possible, he adapted and thrived and tv is dying
Definitely top 10
My stomach hurts from all the comedy gold! Definitely watching this a second time just to laugh more....
Hear me out, Eminem is dropping a new album this year and he's gone promoting it more than his previous albums soooooooooooo...
This might be the greatest Hot Ones episode ever lol, Conan is a gem
Just with that Doctor bit alone, how could anyone in that room keep a straight face? Conan is a comedy genius.
Might be the best episode yet!
This episode. Thank you fwf 🙏🏼
Legendary, absolutely legendary. Thank you Conan, and good luck Conan's intenstines.
finally a guest that doesnt pretend its actually spicy ROFL
Haven’t had an iconic hot ones interview like this in so long
People forget what a brilliant comic this man is. Also as dumb as can be "I do not fear your wings" 😂😂😂 Not foreshadowing at all
Conan taking the bones with him in his pocket really, really got me! 🤣
I don’t want to see the term “unhinged” used for anything even one degree milder than that performance.
That was the most coherent rambling I've ever heard. True professional.
I was delighted to see that Dr. José is still gainfully employed, especially after all those botched circumcisions.  It's been wonderful seeing Conan in front of the camera again this week. There's still a pretty big void in my heart where his nightly show used to be.
This has to be the best interview yet. Good job guys.
Good stuff man! Had no idea O’brian was so comical
So far... this has GOT to be one of my most favorite episodes.
my pockets are full 🤣
That’s our favorite redhead’s pain threshold!
Conan is an absolute gem
Well I didn't expect for Conan to be my favorite interview so far, but here we are.
CONAN NON STOP!!!!
I hope I die before Conan because I don't wanna live in a world without this man.
this is the hardest Ive laughed watching these lol.
Best one!
22:55 is a look from Sean that says, "I'm pretty sure we're liable for Conan's death in about three minutes."
I had no idea what I was in for when I started this. Legendary.
Best season finale ever 🎉 CONAN IS THE GOAT. 🐐
Thank you team.
Saw a little bit of  John Belushi in Connan at the end.
Conan is in a league of his own
Why is your sponsor a bigoted place of hate?
I haven't had this much fun since Gordon Ramsey. This was an incredible episode! Conan is a true showman! Thank you all for making this happen! :)
I applauded at the end. Best episode ever. Conan demolished it. There will never be a better guest.
Throughout all 23 seasons of Hot Ones how many guests have ever poured EXTRA Da Bomb onto the wing?  If anyone were to do it, it's Conan 😂
Conan always looks like his head is on fire🥵🔥..call 911!!!😂
Ice Spice<<<>>>Conan O’Brien Wings on a spectrum
The best interview ever bar none.
Anything that has the name "MAX" in it is up to no good
Absolutely Unhinged 😮😂😂 and brilliant at the same time 😂😂
He went all in on this.
16:55 best part. ARE WE DOING THIS OR NOT!
The sauce spilling at the end with the close up 😂.
Okay this is how you promote a show because I literally wouldn’t have cared to watch but now I must
Think about offering raddish next to the milk. It cuts the heat too.
Conan O'Brien giving Sean Evans his flowers 💐
That's the Conan I came for, fantastic 😂
Best guest ever ! 🔥
This was incredible
I’m glad I can point people to this now when I try to tell them Conan is actually the funniest person to have ever lived
They have to get  Jordan on after this
Conan  will FOOOOORRREVVVEEERR  BE THE BEST!!!
I got into watching Conan back in the late 90s while on swing shift.  He’s always been a bit nutty but always stayed true to himself.
Conan the absolute God of comedy. A masterclass indeed for every comedian young or old, coming up or well established. This man is timeless in his comedy and youthful in his energy. There's nobody who does it better!
Steve-o needs to up his game after this
the best I could ask for
Dude 😂😂😂😂
This was absolutely hilarious!!
No one has eaten the wings with such vigor before
This might be the first time I’ve seen Sean genuinely stunned 😅
Best hot ones ever
The minute Conan’s lips turned red I knew he was feeling it. Absolute pro.
Probably your best episode of all time hahahahaa… 👏👏👏👏
Yooooo! Conesie made it to Hot Ones!
In an industry where everyone is trying to out cool each other, Conan is comfortable being at the complete other end of the spectrum and that’s why we love him.
Putting a half eaten chicken wing into a $690 Calvin Klein jacket is an insane flex
“You say this is pure pepper?”
"Why can't I feel?!"
this is the most epic episode
This one is a great one
Need a aqua spray ad in this episode.  Lol. He smokes herb  Nice hair cut ride the wave. Og
And this, my friends. Is why Conan has been, and will always be my hero.
I love that guy
Finally…. After all these years…
Unhinged CoCo is my favorite. Bravo. 🔥
This couldn’t have been more perfect. End the show now 😂
conans speech at the end made me feel some type of way this is truly his philosophy, he can find the happiness and comedy in everything and that is the beauty of conan. put him on an empty sheet of ice in the middle of arctic tundra and he will find the comedy there
Peak Hot Ones
Man I feel like we are wasting Conan's best years. Get this guy a new contract please.
Legend ❤
sean is lost for words
Give the man seventeen red carpets. He deserves it.
I love him, so unhinged for the season finale… more than 1m views in 9 hours, you are going to see 10-15m by the end of the week lol
That was next level, has to be the top Hot Ones performance of all time.
Conan is going to send that jacket to the dry cleaners with the pockets full of chicken wings. 😂
Hands down the best guest I’ve ever watched on Hot Ones! Didn’t stop laughing the whole way through 😂😅
R.I.P. Connan! 😂
Dr. where did you practice ? Out of state ... Hilarious... Great show Sean ... Thx
Conan is the GOAT!!!
This is the greatest episode ever, Conan is a legend!
GREATEST episode of all time! Conan is the GOAT
Shouldve said "the show with hot wings and even hotter guests" this time
What a legend! ❤
That was incredible. Hardest I've laughed a guest in awhile
Bad optics
Conan doing a bit on someone else’s show 😅😅
This is the best interview to date
Bravo!
I have to say this is probably the funniest episode of my opinion. Had me laughing the whole time😂😂
I have new respect for Conan.  Steve-O couldn't have done that.
This wins the internet 😂 Conan the wing Barbarian  Can't wait to hear his story a day later😂
Just the absolute best.
YESS
This should be the series finale! You’re never topping this.
Bro really thought we forgot he folded for a pornstar
Not Funny At ALL. Conan is washed up and disgusting. Tries too hard only to fail. One of the worst episodes ever. Creep!
Conan is the 🐐
Conan telling the water buffalo story and then putting sauce on a wing, hands, face 😂
I've been a fan for many many many seasons. It's great to see how iconic your show has become, congrats on another season finale, keep'em coming!!! 🎉🎉🎉
legendary
Conan is 1of1 Last of a dying breed  Goat
this is the BEST episode of hot ones till date i love how sean didnt even have to tell conan about the last dab and putting a bit more coz-
Feel like Conan would be a few guy to share a few bumps with
Conan O Brien is one of those humans that make you grateful to share times with.
You can act though the mouth pain - but tomorrow is gonna be a different story  on that old chilli hole.
Had to edit this... CONAN IS A LEGEND. CONAN MUST BE PROTECTED AT ALL COSTS! We are stuck with Jimmy Gallon now.... such a fake human being. Conan the last real one!
I think blood is pouring from Conan’s eyes at the end 😂
Possibly the greatest episode of Hot Ones of all time!
Holy cow this was one for the ages.
Not gonna lie this episode was definitely one of the greats!
Man! I love Conan so much
please for the love of god get this man his permanent show back!!!! i only wish him the very best!!!!!!!
If anyone knows Conan, you know would just WIN the gautlet! Congrats to Sean for the high praise. Everything Conan does is chaotic irish gold! I have really been enjoying his entertaining podcast.
Can you guys bring on Shawn Mendes again😩💕💕
This was peak 90s Conan. I never expected to see this level of insanity back again, but live long enough.. and legends return.
He won
What a crazy good ending to a season!!  Crazy comedy, but still answering seriously is just perfect.
Conan O'Brien talking about how he jumped on a water buffalo as a gag because he is happy to do idiotic things in the name of comedy and then fewer than 5 minutes (video time) later eating an insane amount of Da Bomb is such a clear indication that he has not learned anything and will never change and that's what makes him a god of comedy
Conan is, was, and will forever be, the GOAT.
the wing in the pocket was fire
😂 😂😂😂 I’m laughing so hard Conan rubbing his chest 😅😅
There will never be another Conan O’Brien 🫶🏼
I havent cried laughing like that in such a long time thank you for this
Conan is one of the last of the greats ❤
This was Funny
This is the definitive hot ones episode thus far.
Conan is the GOAT. Proves it time and time again
This why Conans the goat
This was epic
Conan remains the greatest of all time.
best episode ever filmed
It's disappointing that they faked the hot sauces for Conan. It's quite obvious. People say his red skin gives away that he's feeling heat but not really. It does that through the course of a regular show.
Get Roman Reigns next!
Conan was, is and will always will be my favorite talk show host.
I just witnessed a man loose his marbles 😂
Conan O'Brien is and will forever be an absolute legend. What an episode. What an entertainer.
This is the pinnacle, will be hard to top this one.
Coco is nuts, 🥥
This is what a king looks like!
Best episode 🎉
Best one I have seen yet.
Love how he calls Leno "the other guy"
This is the BEST episode 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm pretty sure Dr. Arroyo's called that because his first name is actually Doctor.
“Is there a point where these get warm,” and then proceeds to drink hot sauce! 🤣🤣🤣
One of the best shows I have seen. Thanks Conan for making me laugh. Cheers
I really thought he'd be a big girls blouse but struth! Cracked me up. Best interview ever.
I love how Conan created a bit out of the interview
I think this show has reached it's apex, you can only go downhill from Conan O'Brien.
The BEST HOT ONES EVER!!!!!!!! They bring on a LEGEND for the season finale!!!!!!
My favorite wire guy 😂😂😂
Thank you baby Jesus I needed this laugh.
That was thoroughly entertaining!
The guest we've all been waiting for. I went in ecstatically eager see the greatest Hot Wings performance of any guest ever, and ended confirming that I just witnessed the greatest Hot Wings performance of any guest ever.  There will never be another Conan.
That was crazy 😅
Warren Harding invented the word ‘normalcy’🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
This is the most unhinged episode I've ever seen. Conan O'Brien, I salute you. You are amazing.
Is Conan O’Brien in any movies? If he’s not he should be in one with Jeff Goldblum.
Best Hot Ones EVER….
This one was great....the energy!
Conan is the only actually funny laye night show host to ever exist. And if you haven't watched his shorts on YouTube go there immediately
24:20… I thought dude was about to have a heart attack lol
All timer.
I wonder if Conan will forget about those wings in his pockets and then find them a few days or so later.
I saw the thumb nail and knew I was in for the best episode of hot ones yet.
Ever since I started watching Hot Ones, I have been waiting forever for Conan!  My dream has finally come true!!! I love Conan and Sean and Hot Ones❤
Anyone find Conan's marbles? Seems to be missing a few. :D Great show.
Conan has always been hilarious
This is the most impressive hot ones appearance of all time.
Even on the visitor's turf, you can't cage Kong! Absolute legend!
The Tommy Chong episode was my favorite up to this one. Now Conan is in the lead. Conan you rock !!!!
On the end.... he is just sad !
Dude talked a big game and delivered - that is a machine
I love Conan
Conan might be animated AF…. But he is a BEAST!!! He made them wings his b**** 🤯😂🌶️🍗
I am mortified and impressed at the same time, i am inspired. And I have witness the true heart of a warrior. I am in awe.
Absolutely amazing, best episode ever by far. Much respect Conan and Sean.
Conan over here setting a new bar drinking the hot sauce. 😂
Watched this 9 hours after it posted, already about 1.2 million views. I’m not surprised
Thats my birthday too😅
Epic!
👏
lets gooooo
Absolute treasure of a man
I love Conan and I miss Norm McDonald dearly 😭😭😭😭😭
I was certain that the reason why the much requested Conan O’Brien hadn’t done this show was because he knew his Irish tongue wouldn’t be able to get through the wings…..cut to  the most heat ever consumed on the show! Wow 👏🏼
The best
Epic
@23:50 That camera pan to the liquid death glugging slowly out of the bottle as Conan talks about Don Quixote and Sancho Panza is cinematic gold
Best interview ever!
This has been the gratest episode. Conan is crazier that the bomb
NOBODY commits to a bit like Mr. O'Brien! 👏👏🔥🔥
I can’t tell what’s a bit and what’s real In this episode lol
33 years old, grew up watching conan. dude has still got it! so funny man
jordan next
Crazy man. Amazing.
THE GOAT
Hands down best episode ever!!
That was incredible!
Conan O'brien is my spirit animal....
Wish there was a question on jordan schlansky 😂
Best guest ever!!!!!❤😂❤
This the best episode.
Chaos O'Brien
This is the best one ever!
this is the best episode ive ever seen
Conan is an absolute nut case! One of the greatest entertainers ever! What a finale!
This is the new peak. No one will ever top this episode
Conan is thee funniest and best talk show host
Is this what the peak looks like? It all seems so clear from here.
Still social distancing?
my god, this got to be the best episode ever
Peak Conan! Hardest I’ve laughed in a long time!!
You Conin did not disappoint.   Unbelievable.
Conan is a legend for this episode... Among many other things
Best Hot Ones ever!!! Conan is the greatest!!!
Legendary!
Ok, I have seen good episodes, but Conan is top 1 without a doubt.  This man is so awesome that we saw Sean's face half the time we usually do. What an insane performer Conan is.
Admit it..... you just Googled - conan Obrien  water Buffalo.....
I knew when I clicked on this episode that it was going to be good but wow, Conan just dunked on like 98% of every guest that came before him. Haha
I 💜Conan
Sean was not ready for this energy lol
Best one ever!
What unhinged lunacy. LOVE IT!
That doctor skit was so cringe
Hands down the best episode yet. Conan is a legend!
Conan's Nixon motorboating impression with Da Bomb all over his peace sign fingers Is the funniest thing ever.   No one has taken Da Bomb better than Conan because not only was he chill about it, he continued on with fantastic comedy. This is one for the books in comedy and tolerance. The guy will do anything for a laugh, including not flinching through slathering Da Bomb all over his tongue multiple times and this is proof.
I haven't watched yet, but this is going to be epic!!!
21:16 got me rolling 🤣🤣🤣
Finally someone who eats the whole wing
Conan crushed those wings. Has to be one of the better performances and interviews.
My favorite episode EVER
'The worst thing a guest can do is tell the audience "It's not going well".' Gets Kari Wuhrer flash backs
This is sublime. I never expected it to be on this platform, but for me this performance cements that Conan is not only one of the greatest to ever do it, but an amazing human being. He took the show and its premise, looked into its soul, grabbed it by the throat, distilled its essence, and took it to its logical conclusion. And on the way, taught us a thing or two about how life should be lived. Hats off.
"WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME WHY CANT I FEEL?!?!" God I love Conan
That has to be one of the funniest hot ones episode !
CONAN THE WING DESTROYER!
Wow  3:09   I’ve never heard Conan thank an interviewer for doing their research
I knew the conan episode would be good but not Hot Sauce induced psychosis good
You just witnessed the greatest hot ones episode, ever...period...the end. WRAP IT UP, NO MORE AFTER THIS!
Conan is on another level. He’s one of the greatest to ever do it.
I’m crying 🤣🤣
Conan is the best comedy mind of my lifetime. Amazing
Conan keeping the wings, hes afraid for his DNA to be cloned hahahahhaha
This can't be real. . .
MAN....This is monumental, CONAN is a legend!
The best show yet 🤣🤣🤣
Conan killed this for real. Brilliant reaction. No fear.
No words for this!
I laughed out loud and often.  What a guy.
Conan said "it's a show, not a bit!"  Then he proceeded to demonstrate the difference.  Incredible.
Impressive in all aspects!!!👏😎
Mr. Rudd has been dethroned.
23:00 is just ridiculously funny
LEGEND !!!!!!!!!
Conan the Hot Wing God
Oh dear GAWD I know the doctor and can't think of who he is!
Absolute unhinged Conan is what the world needs rn
AMAZING!
The old Lady from Requiem For A Dream- "I'm Fine" 😅😅😅😅
"Your lips have been paralyzed and what I heard was sasslpronggg  rethdethdeth" 😂
The cut to Conan's insane face as he's screaming "I'm fine!" had me in tears
This is an instant classic. One of the best episodes yet. Conan being the legend he is. I’m sure that night was awful. I hope he drank a bottle of pepto after 😂
Best hot ones appearance! Thank you Conan for all those high school weeknights of great entertainment. Always been rooting for ya, cant wait to see the new show!
Conan is built different.
this is why we've been saying that he's the best for 30 years.
This has to be if not the best but at least at top 3 episodes from First we Feast :)
I screamed at him to stop. 😂
what a pro
The second Conan said, "Water buffalo", i wet myself laughing
Best First We Feast ever!!!!!!!
Conan O'Brien just made me subscribe to this channel. Conan O'Brien will always rule late night TV and now podcasts
The lords of spice smiled upon Conan that day
Impressive, full focus forward,reads and references the Classics.Of course he's Irish!
The wings in the pocket sent me
“I never saw a spice” 😂😂😂😂😂
This was pretty much what I expected... but I'm old. So there's that.
Undisputed Hot Ones Champion! Get that man a trophy!
King of hot ones.
Coney has 1.1M views for an ep that was dropped 9 hours ago. The other recent ones got 1M views when it has been weeks since their episode came out.
This is the greatest episode yet!!
Love how Conan refers to Jay Leno as ‘the other guy’  6:25
Conan is so real for this though I’ve tried the sauce before it really isn’t that bad
this is now one of my favorite interview! LOL
Man alive, I've been watching Hot Ones for years and have never seen anyone completely dominate the entirety of the episode like this! Nice one Conan lol. 😀
I love Conan so much
I liked this video before I even watched it
Long live the King!
Conan is giving Rick Sanchez levels of unhinged in this episode😂
This was absolutely incredible
This was absolutely the best. I loved this one
Sean's quiet "don't do it" when Conan starts pouring hot sauce on the wings is hilarious
A F****ing Plause *bravo* For just da bomb.. the rest are much more milder..
Conan Your A Beast Love It, Makes  Me Smile Never disappointed.
Conan GOAT status 💪🤣
This is the best hot ones I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen a lot
What a way to end a season
I can now die peacefully 🙄😴
Best guest ever
I see Conan, I hit like before even watching the video
I think this is the best one ever.  Totally see why they saved it for the finale.  He rocked it and made it look easy.
I’ve been watching Conan on Late Night since I was a kid and I am in love with his podcast. I have been also watching Hot Ones for years now too and I love how unique this is episode is compared to most of the recent episodes. Conan starts out completely calm and collected, then by the end he is a total mess. My man recently turned 60 and he’s still got it!😂
What a performance. This is the peak, right here.
Living legend
It's a shame they pulled him off prime time. He was so funny, especially the segment 'In The Year 2000'.
i'm crying and wheezing. thank you Conan
I think Conan would be a great Joker in DC.
I couldn't stop laughing, best episode ever!
Best episode ever by far!!!
WOW, GO CONAN!!
Conan decided when the sauce called his bluff that he had no choice but to go absolutely ballistic
Hahahahaha
I'm in tears 😂😂 I've never laughed this hard
Man this the funniest so far. Love Conan! Awesome!!!
That was the best any chance to see Conan is always a blast!
And Conan does what he does best...take something that could have been entertaining and had substance and turn it into a complete waste of time. Ridiculous....but that's Conan.
XD Beautiful man God yes !
Conan delivered. What a good sport. The man had no shame, and that is amazing.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I love Conan. Been watching him since the beginnings. Great job😂😂😂😂😂
It's probably the best hot ones so far.... this was amazing!!!!
Christ that was good
BEST HOT ONES YET !!!!
This one was painful to watch but also it was pure gold, one of the best interviews of hot ones of whole time, I'm so happy after it, Conan is just amazing and Sean never disappoints
"Can we get a baseline pulse? Its there" 😂😂😂😂
So glad Conan kept doing bits throughout what was otherwise an interview that would have stood on its own. He’s a born entertainer
I really hoped Andy Richter was gonna show up
Conan is a legend. Loved seeing this segment!
Conan turned into Robin Williams by the end of this 😂
Just feed him pure capsaicin at this point
Conan is making the Irish proud 👏 LEGEND
Never have I laughed more watching Hot Ones
Hey, what's up, Sean. Cocan says you!?
Conan just blew our minds by delivering arguably the best episode ever. He pushed so many limits, while being pure and authentic in his answers while being the  insane entertainer he is. That was PERFECT. WOW!!!!
Conan is insane 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love this guy! GOAT of talk show hosts!
Didn't he tell Shakira she was closing out this season??
He is crazy, Conan is going to the ER after this😮😮😮😂
This is the greatest hot ones interview of all time. Conan is a legend.
Best episode yet. Conan is a legit Nut
Is it just me or does he turn into Rick Sanchez at the end there?
Max and Relax.
Season 23 my personal favorites, John Mulaney, John Oliver and CoCo!!!! Conan deserves SOOOOOO much more credit than he gets for what he did for late night TV and for comedy as a whole.
*WING DROP!* 😂😅😂
Conan GOAT
I'll just say, you may NEVER top this episode. Period
Conan, #1 GOAT number one
This may be the peak of western culture.
Is this real? Seems like he went really hard.
Best episode ever!!! 😂🤣
When the doctor first came to check the pulse 😂😂😂
Conan is an comedy savant
I don't know what guest could ever top this. It's over.
this is a top 5 episode
Machine...
Amidst all the insanity from this interview - let's acknowledge what I think is the first 'Wing Drop' if the series!
Oh yeah! Sweet little Leno dig there, did you catch it after he answers is there chat when in commercial? COB is the GOAT
Best Evah 😂
Ahh Conan, a true statesmen, and role model!
My stomach hurts from laughing so hard
This is a match made in heaven, best episode I've seen of this show.
6:22 "If you were talking to a Letterman, he wouldn't say much. The other guy... I don't know where he was." We all know who "the other guy" is. And no, we still haven't forgiven him.
I learned me and Conan share a birthday today cool my goal has always been to perform on his show wish it was still around
This might be the greatest Hot Ones episode of all time!
Dude Conan crushed the Hot Ones challenge, second only to I think Dave Ghrol! There were some pretty  stoic thirds and fourths, but Conan hit that outta the park, both ability to take the spice and pure entertainment value!
Roland Duchesne’s Hot Sauce Tasting Network channel
Conan is my hero.
Epic
Hahaha this is too good
Chris Farley would love this
Is it just me, or was Conan doing a Lewis Black impression there at the end with the wild tie and the old man rant?
Conan is always a showman. I will say, that compliment coming from conan one of the greatest late night hosts of all time is huge.
Some people take it upon themselves to be known by a one word name but Conan has truly earned the title of "Conan".
Best show so far
This is a great example of what adrenaline can do
Conan O'Brien is a Madman! Loved this crazy Boston Irishman for 30 plus years!
Speechless!
Conan is the funniest and most entertaining late night show host of all time.
Just the "Oh my god" from Sean as hes shaking Da Bomb everywhere proceeding to put it to his mouth was pure comedy.
First time I have EVER commented on any public forum and I will say Conan did this show the BEST. What a professional. Thank you for showing us the comedy standard 🧡
Funniest thing I've seen in a while. Conan is a comic genius.  Savant.  God.
I went to a conan stand up show a few years back. When they asked the crowd if anyone had a question for conan the man who asked was looking right at me. I had a million but froze. It'll be the biggest regret of my life.
Well done, this channel just hit the big time!
Respect Conan!!!
Did Conan do a Chris Farley?
Conan's well on the way to becoming more unpredictably nuts than Gary Busey.
YESS hahahahahaha BEST EVER\o/
3:20 he bouta get his show pulled for that comment RIP
This man has informed my sense of humour for my entire life. I love him.
Conan gathered all his DNA before he left.add sure all 12 Jones were accounted for.😂
I’ve NEVER seen Sean laugh like this 🤣🤣🤣
Out of control, love it
Man Conan O Brien is my favourite talk show host. Glad on getting him on the show.
Grew up watching Conan since his show in the early 90's. He's a legend.  The only guy I know that can make me LoL
Ending with a wing drop. 😂
this is on the mount rushmore of hot ones episodes
G.O.A.T.
Da Bomb claims another victim lul
Legend.
Conan is Insane!!! LOLOLOL
The genuine fear in Sean's face :(
Putting the chicken wings in his pocket is killing me🤣
I just want to know what blush is Conan wearing???
This is truly the best episode ever, completely off the rails. Conan 😅
Conan commits !
Conan is Legend
FINALLYYYYY AHHHHHHHH IM SO HAPPYY!!!!! 🥹🥹🥹🥹
Conan is the best. Always has been.
I called in to conan's hotline and said I was his secret fantasy lover. They aired it on his podcast and he said he would leave his wife and kids for me 😂😂😂 Conan, you are even sexier than the guy I first watched in 2010. I have been paying for "Max" for 2 years JUST to wait for your show to come out!
seans “OH MY GOD” when conan started licking the da bomb wing absolutely killed me 😂  edit: that ending was legendary. conan is a madman! 😂
Conan's lip lying, but his eyes tells the truth 🤣
HAHAHAH finally someone real
yes!!!!!
most unhinged
MA' MAN‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️💪🏻  Never have I clapped, lol, salute to a show in my life..  I thank you for being such a great host Sean, to your team, and for inviting an idol of mine to be on your wonderful finale 🙏🏻  Perfection
Modern day mix of Farley and Williams..Genius.
red threads
Wipe your mouth Conan! LOL
I love that Conan is channeling some Chris Farley.
Favorite episode hands down😂😂😂
Conan channeled Farley and Williams, he gave them their time on Hot Ones. All while being his brilliant self, well done sir!
Jim Carrey. Please, Jim Carrey. Please, find a way.
My favorite tv show host forever never understood why people didn’t love Conan, I hope he gets a lot more fans off of this
WOW. Not sure what else to say but......WOW!!!
Conan is unstoppable!
Conan making fun of Max unironically has me adding the show to my watch list😂
Next time  Sona and Matt need to join if we thought this was chaos I can only imagine what that would be like. This was....epic
23:00 Amy Winehouse 5 minutes before she died
the best one yet
HAIL, CONAN!!! HAIL, CONAN!!!  =X-D
Conan cured my anxiety
<wing drop>
This is the best episode in years, absolute gold.
Best episode ever. Conan is a true showman and an absolute maniac.
omg:D:D:D:D Shon is loooosing show:D O M F G :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD this should be 1.4h slong:D
A+
I LOVE CONAN!!!!!!
Top 5 eps - has to be. Conan was perfect!
Conan has the toughest mouth on the block
The distress on Sean's face @21:41 anticipating what Conan will do to top the previous finger-licking "bit" was gold. Would love to see Jordan Schlansky in here sometime. Indeed great "TV", Mr. O'brien.
One of my favorite episodes!
BEST EPISODE OF ALL TIMMEEE
😂😂😂😂
😂
Connan should go to Haiti again. It's nice this time of year.
There was talk of gerbils
This is the first hot ones episode I immediately restarted to watch again, incredible!!
Holy chet
Amazing. Just amazing.
Brazil Here. Esse foi de longe o melhor episódio, Conan é de outro mundo! O cara não para por um segundo, ainda bem que ele continua atuando e não vejo a hora de ver o novo programa no Max!
One of the most entertaining guests, and he went the distance! 😮 Woo woo!
Quite possibly the greatest physical comedy performances I’ve seen. 11/10🎉
Conan O’ Brien is a legend. Definitely one of the best
Oh this was the best one! Gotta love Conan!
BEST EPISODE EVER
Jay Leno is Conan's Voldemort. Who knew???
Conan is like the anti-DJ Khalid
😮
Conan just wanted to feel he was a real boy
Best episode ever hands down. Conan for president 🤣🤣💪💪
This is the most entertaining episode ever!!
Conan you’re the best and Sean you’re the best at bringing out the best in your interviews ❤❤
Easily the best episode you ever did.
The greatest showman this show has ever seen period
..”THIS IS LIFE!!!!!!”👍🤣
Conan bringing in a doctor is so in character
Conan saves the season. After so many young, perfect, a-list celebrities with sound bite answers and no emotion, we get an all time great epsiode. Well done Conan and well done Sean.
Conan freaking crushed this!! I loved how he $h!t talked the entire time and took the wings like a champion!! I laughed so hard!!! A great finale 😊
LOVE Conans interview with Norm Macdonald and Courtney Thorne Smith... funniest thing ever!
best one ever!
GOAT
Okay, G. Ramsay RIP
Pure chaos. I expected nothing less.
i know conan is unhinged, but he is UNHINGED in this one 😂
Best episode by far.
HANDS DOWN GREATEST EPISODE OF HOT ONES
OMFG!
He and Gordon Ramsey are my favorites
unhinged
Absolute INSANITY!
Best guest ever!
Well it's all down hill from here, hands down BEST guest PERIOD.
what an incredible episode. Just wow.
This was so chaotic, I am so stressed out 😂
I'm not sure this one can be topped.
We are literally in awe of comedic performance...just genius level.
Conan: "The water buffalo and I made amends. We're good now" Cut to display of hot sauces lined up side by side.
He one uped Steve o!!
When I see performances that extreme from someone who supposedly does not have experience with spices, I start to wonder if a real doctor didn't write a one-off prescription for something along the lines of Gabapentin and/or a calcium-channel blocker to reduce nerve excitation and pain signal transduction.
This one didn’t hit for me.  Conan was just too much… I know that’s him, guess I just wasn’t up for it.
Conan has been cracking me up for over 25 years! So smart and funny!
End the show, cuz NO ONE is topping that appearance
This episode is up there with the Gordon Ramsey Episode. Love Conan!!!
So cool to see Conan on Hot Ones!!! He is my favorite late night host EVER. Carson is second.
Dr Arroyo shoulda said he went to the University of Science.
I can just imagine Sona and Gourleys disappointment while watching this 😂😂😂
Conan. Is. A. BOSS. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
you can close the show after this one
one of the best episodes ever
best episode ever????
This is hands down the best Hot Ones episode I've seen! I love how it started to get more chaotic towards the end!! 😂😂 Conan is a comedy genius!!
He wins
Conan dies after being on the talk show "Hot Ones".
Yeah that was legit
This is the first time I've seen Sean look terrified. He looks scared Conan is about to die or something. 🤣
I love how Conan said season finale as if Dean isn't back in two weeks, it's how they got 28 seasons in like 5 years haha
I literally never comment, but this video is too good. This one and the Jake Gyllenhaal one are the best. Man that was hilarious, I love conan he is such an inspiration and the fact he continues to be hilarious is awesome, also when he called Sean a great host that was legitimately amazing. Love both Sean and Conan and their works❤.
RIP Conan's colon
There will never be anyone that tops this performance
Conan is a champion of the people 🏆
The best episode of all time!
Best episode.
that is a professional right there. I guess I will be watching Conan's show on Max, formerly known as HBO
IT FINALLY HAPPENED
BEST EPISODE EVER
Liza's one lucky lady.  😂
Conan is a legend.
Conan is a LUNATIC. This interview / performance ( "interformance"? "performerview"? ) was EASILY on par with either Conan's "Walker: Texas Ranger lever" bit from his pre-Turner days, or any of Andy Kaufman's, um...whatever the heck those were from SNL. One or the other. Lol!
I like how Conan turned into Bill OReilly at the end
Took 9 hours to get more views than Ice Spice the last 2 weeks.
you can physically see the difference in his lips before & after DaBomb 😂😂🤌🏽
legend
G.O.A.T.!
After a lackluster season,Hot Ones has been redeemed by Conan O'Brien
I love how chaotic Conan is 😂
I’m not sure how anyone ever follows this up
And folks this is the last time we saw conan
Conan’s doctor reminds me of Ron from GTA5
That man going to have to go to the emergency room
Conan is an extreme feast BEAST!! Dear lord.
All time epic episode!!
GOAT, no other comment
Jesus, nobody is talking about Conan's last dab?!  He might be the GOAT after that.  Has anyone else ever poured that much?
Conan is amazing. Everything he does is gold. I mean the opening bit "where did you go to school?" "uhh 1998" "no where did you go" "oh, uhh out of state" "you should go"  Also, safe to say Conan gave himself an ulcer so we could be entertained lol
There are simply no words to describe this performance. Just bravo gentlemen and congrats to all of us for getting to watch this
Freakin Conan.. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.  Love the dude..
I'd like this twice
Didn’t know Conan had mad wing eating skills 😂 Coney we salute you 🫡🫡🫡
Another masshole
Conan is super iconic with everything he does.
...And we have a new King of Hot Ones...  Truly the quintessential guest of all time...  including the future.  Take that Hall of Shame WIMPS...!
Did anyone else start feeling like Conan was starting to sound like Rick from Rick and Morty at the end when be want on his rant? This man is a comedy genius
The most I’ve laughed at any episode of this show. Conan is a treasure.
Mind-blowing
The best one yet!
Honestly, this would have been a good series finale to go out on. No one's ever going to top this episode.
Conan is a boss
Absolute nut job
This might be the funniest episode of Hot Ones ever
What an incredible end of season, guys you really came with one of the best persons, one of the greatest characters and amazing human being, thank you for all your effort!
I feel bad for any guests who have to follow this episode
This should be the series finale. Hand the crown over to Conan the great.
The absolute definition of insanity... Wow
25:44 CONAN: "You're not a Doctor are you"? DR. AROYO: "No but I should be"  hahahahahahha this entire episode was beyond insanity!!!!
Will Conan have enough animal bones for his next ritual? Tune in next time..
“What’s wrong with me why can’t I FEEL?!”
The bottle of Da Bomb wasn’t the real thing.  As much as he put on, he would've freaked out the second it hit his lips.
Not me screaming involuntarily every time conan basically DRINKS THE HOTSAUCE HAHAHAHHA he’s the BEST KIND OF CRAZY THERE IS. Love you Conan!! Been a fan since Late Night Era
Conan the barbarian
Funniest episode so far in the entire history of the series!!!!!
Again Again!
How is he the literal funniest person alive like I'm in awe at his commitment to everything he does
Salute Conan! Salute!! 🖖👊🙏🤌
Best one ever!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The absolute best episode - and the bar was high.  Now, even higher.  CONAN!
Conan is amazing 🤩. Best episode yet
I love this so much but i had to hide in the comments when he started uncontrollably salivating
He comes in and devours wings at ease, insane
Conan didn't disappoint. My favorite talk show host.
Phenomenal performance.
omg:D top3 is crushed :D Con is my faw now
What a magnificent madman!  At times reminded me of Williams, Hopper, Farley, Nicholson, etc.  Poured his whole being into making a good episode.  Epic season finale!
24:04 anyone that has fed an infant solid food for the first time knows _that_ face! 😂
We just a  watched comedic moment that will be remembered forever! This is the single greatest episode, I do not think this can be topped. CONAN IS THE GOAT!!!
Absolute chaos and I loved every second of it! This by far has been my favorite one! 🔥
How the heck did he do that? This guy is a beast!
I have no idea how any future celebrity will top this.  That was amazing.
The goat Conan just did not disappoint 😂 very entertaining and hilarious to watch!
Best Hot Ones yet. He a goat.
His hair reminds me of TinTin.
NGL, this 100% makes up for Ice Spice. Well done Coco!
tbh this one of my favorite episodes
This is the comedy equivalent of watching a contestant go all the way on Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Amazing
This was the best episode of Hot Ones ever.
THE GOAT 🐐 ❤
Could you imagine if this had been the first episode and set the tone for the show?
Conan have it 9000% for this season finale
0:43 just like bill burr
WHAT KIND OF DRUGS DID THIS MAN TAKE
The best to ever do it. There will never be another
Conan is morphing into Hunter S Thompson
been waiting for this
10/10 content
Conan absolutely roasting HBOs rebranding at the end of this chaos has to be one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
This is the BEST episode i’ve ever seen 😂😂😂
Easily up there with ramsay episodes in pure hilarity.  Conan is insane
the ‘wing drop” at the end 😂
This episode is going to be a juggernaut in terms of views. Conan deserves it. 1000% commitment to the bit.
This has to be FUNNIEST episode this SEASON
best cold ones interview yet, conan's the goat
Best episode ever
This is BY FAR the BEST episode to date!
Best Hot Ones ever. 100%.
Conan is a living legend. I love you Conan O'Brien.
Best one yet!
Best guest *_EVER._*
Conan just gained a new fan. Absolutely legend 😂
Holy!! Conan won hot ones!!
Conan never disappoints
this is possible one of the best ones I have seen
I am curious if he was sick as a dog after this shoot.
hands down, best episode of ANY season!
Conan is an absolute SAVAGE😂😂😂😂😂
Conan is the MAN
I'm utterly convinced they've somewhat watered these down in the recent seasons compared to the first ones. A lot these guests seems to be just breezing through the hot sauce like its nothing. I remember back then, guests would quit halfway because of how spicy it was.
Next we need Jordan schlansky on here
LEGEND!
Best show yet 😂
"It's there".  😂😅
You got Conan high
I love him so much
THE GOAT
Best episode of the season! Everything before this was weak AF!
Best one yet!!
THE most entertaining episode!  Conan is WILD 😂
I don't think anyone will ever live up to this performance. Hot Ones has officially peaked.
Best interview ever!
BEST! HOT ONES! EVER!!!  Conan is the master!!!!
I'm pretty sure Conan was encountering interdimensional beings by the end of this episode. That was WILD!
GOAT
Conan is, and will always be the best. Thanks First we feast, Sean, and the whole hot one crew.
Conan is the GOAT!! Legend
I was dying laughing at the madman rant at the end, couldn't stop laughing!!!
GOAT. Has anyone checked on Sean today? He may have been killed trying to keep up with a literal god.
Conan O'Brien IS THE BEST INTERVIEW ON THIS SHOW!!!!!!!! With a Long list of Great interviews.
That was the most impressive hot sauce slapdown I have ever witnessed.  And it was even more impressive that it was Conan.  Epic in every way!
Just wow. I always wondered what a midlife crisis meltdown actually was or what it would be like. Even at Conans age, I think I truly found my answer. Good work to you, Sean, as always.
That was amazing
he is the best one yet he aall most did all of them with out a.reaction that or he is just a super good actor
Best one for sure.
A truly special gift. I will need to rewatch this several times as I was laughing so much and the pace was relentless. Conan, you good sir, are exceptional. Is it too early to call for an encore?
Best one since paul rudd
Making the Irish proud
God I love Conan
Conan: veni, vidi, vici
Well that was a wild ride. Hahah😂
This was the best episode in a long time. Jesus I'd almost forgotten how much I love Conan.
Conan licking da bomb off the wing was insane! I've loved this man since day 1
One day when your kids ask what greatness is you show them this video
I want to see the emails between the Conan team and feast team about including the doctor skit
EPIC😂
TE AMO MAL CONAN!
OH MY GOD THEY GOT CONAN EFFIN O'BRIEN
Best interview ever!!!!
this is just, pure great content, never expected to see conan on the show, amazing as always
Hands down best one I've seen it seemed like he had Sean speechless like Conan hot ones destroyer
Why can't you just say bruise my guy? A hematoma is a bruise. 😢😢
The best Hot Ones. So many great ones but this has taken first place.
I don’t always watch these right away. Sometimes, I’ll be a whole season behind. But when I saw that crazy, unhinged thumbnail (love it!), I had to watch today. Conan is one of my favorite tv personalities. Clips of the old shows and of his current podcast have to be up there as the stuff I watch on YT most frequently. So we’re talking about a collab of two of my favorite people to watch on this platform.  And it did not disappoint. Instantly became one of my favorite episodes. Maybe not the most profound from an interview standpoint, but the entertainment factor was a 10/10. Conan took his antics to 11. Sean held it together like he always does but I think this might be as shocked as he’s been since Bobby Lee, and there’s been a couple Steve-O appearances in that span. Ok… maybe just since the last Steve-O appearance. 😂
Easily the best guest. He wanted to shut us all up for thinking he couldn’t make it past the first nibble.
Finally, a celebrity just went for it and went wild.
Conan is an effin' ANIMAL!
He took that like a G. Respect
the look on Sean's face looking at Conan rubbing the sauce all over this body and face is priceless lol
what a LEGEND
I saw Conan on the thumbnail and immediately understood this was going too be the best hot ones episode Ever
This is my favorite hot ones interview hands down.  Conan is the 🐐
So Conan came in season 23 dominated this show as a guest ! i really love that episode .
I hated it when late night shows went to shorter segments.  An hour and a half with 3 guests is perfect.  The 'hurry up' that has happened since then is only good for Youtube clips.
Coconuts Conan  - HUGE Coconuts!!!
21:05 😂🚀
I think he has been the best guest ever..
Admittedly, this is my first time hearing about this man. I found him to be hilarious and took the sauces like a champ. It was amazing watching him pour more hot sauce on his wings than any previous guest all the while he slowly turned into deeper and deeper shades of red. I loved it.
Un-hinged
Absolute KING. The BEST of the best, truly
AWESOME EPISODE!!
Love seeing Sean uncontrollable laughing. It made me laugh even more. Laughing with tears! Great episode! All time favorite
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤  ONE MILLIE VIEWS ALREADY  !!!!
Is it cool now to pocket your wings ???😮😮
I've waited all my life for this
gingers dontr have a soul xd
This is the HARDEST I have laughed ever watching this show. What a performance, a timeless classic
Conan easily has to be one of the best guests!! Super entertaining.   Been watching Hot Ones for yeeears and it’s so nice to see Sean get the recognition he deserves! What an incredible meaningful compliment from Conan, and Sean absolutely earned it!
Honestly top 3 episodes ever
Jfc,Conan O'Brien has redeemed this season of Hot Ones
Conan brought his A game
natural comedian the best 😂
He is a legend.
Perfect end of Hot Ones so Sean can start his career as a talk show host!!!
The GOAT! Love Conan!
Why didnt Sean put the wings in his jacket?!?!
Yes thank you. Conan is just an amazing human being. My favorite episode by far by far.
“That’s right!!! My intestines have turned into acid and I can still remember the plot.  Thats a professional” 🤣 25:16
This man is pure gold.
CONAN IS THE G.O.A.T!!
How do I double like this episode
Hot Ones looks exactly like Charlie Rose with hot wings 😂
Conan could have just shown up and been an average guest, and I wouldn't have blamed him for it, but he really gave it his all!   When a guest on this show goes all out and is a great guest, it makes me like them so much more.  Also, he knocked the sauces out of the park! Maybe top 10 best at handling the sauces tbh.
Most hilarious season finale of Hot Ones!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan can’t help himself 😂
Everyone should be more like Conan and less like dj khaled
Conan pouring da bomb was a bad move. His bathroom will be a mess
I doubt he lives four more years after that.
Imagine the poor soul who has to follow this up.
Conan is a BEAST, love this man!
This is pure GOLD. The man is made of steel and the GOAT. Love Conan, he's the best. I wish this episode went on for another hour or so.
This was easily the greatest Hot Ones of ALL TIME!!! 😂😂😂
Conan is a SAVAGE!!!
So, I'm a human. And this is what I like about being human.
What a legend
Haven't laughed this hard in a long, long time. Bravo.
If King Kong and Howdy Doody had a baby that turned into a crackhead
theres very few people who have added sauce especially da bomb onto their wing and then crush it. What a savage well done Conan lol
Just when I thought this series was stale and done, along comes Conan! Best episode ever.  Nobody will top this.
I have never enjoyed an episode SO FREAKING MUCH!!!! Conan FOREVER!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is the #1 Hot Ones get well done
Hands-down, the BEST Hot Ones episode of ALL time. 😂
Amazing episode! I admire Conan so much - can't wait for his new series on MAX! Also, can't wait to hear him talk about this on his podcast with Sona and Matt LOL
THIS is how you entertain!
Conan is a gem.
Sorry, but he is now Hot Ones King.
lol goated
I am jacked up after watching this. I feel like taking a big dump on a conference table in the middle of a board meeting after watching this.
God, I love Conan, lol
man i miss him in late night...never been the same without him.
This is the best episode of Hot Ones I have ever seen!
I've never clicked on a video so fast.
Conan might have michael cera on this one for badassery
So good. Conan is wild.
Warren G. Harding was so much worse than mediocre.
Conan is a legend. Best of the best.
Easy my favorite guest on the show
The ending is pure gold so good
Conan is a stronger man than I
I love this show. Easily one of the best things on YouTube. The interviewing is top notch, the selection of guests are amazing. Please change the music. It never fits and is always a distraction.
there's no way the buffalo thing happened right?
Conan is your greatest guest of all time!!!!!!!!!! 😂
I can’t stop laughing 😭😭😭
Dr. Arroyo's Alma Mater
We need Tyson and Holyfield please
Conan is so goofy as always! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kudos to the animators in this episode!
Conan is always committed to the craft this was an amazing episode ❤
I've never watched a Hot Ones episode where I am yelling at my phone "no! Don't do that!!!"
Oh yeah there's gonna be fireworks alright.
I haven't laughed this hard in a long time.
Who else wiping their mouth throughout the second half of this episode for no reason at all haha
19:29  honestly the most impressive part out of all this is Conan immediately dropping the Warren g Harding facts on the spot. This guy study history at Harvard or something? Geeze
I'm on the first wing and it's the funniest episode you've ever had please have him on again
Conan is the late night . Killed the episode. I will 100% be tuning in to Conan O'Brien Must Go on "Max".
Crazzy
Yall don’t know how long I’ve been waiting for this and how much it exceeded my already astronomical expectations. Conan is in the running for one of the funniest people of our time. I would say all time but I havent lived that long😅
That was insane Conan is a pro all the way nothing than respect for that 🙏😂
THE best episode of Hot Ones! Hats off to Conan, still the best!
I did not know conan was like this, would have enjoyed something more calm and sincere, but if he's truly like this then I'm truly surprised
This is easily the craziest episode yet. Love ya Conan!
Ok—this is my top 5 episodes!!
The way you guys redeemed yourselves by having Shakira and then Conan after Ice Spice.
I'm just gonna go ahead and say that in 10 years there'll be comments like "who's still here in 2034? best hot ones guest ever"
This is the best episode so far and I do not expect anything less from Conan lol Now I am going to Max on April 18th lol
Best Guest and Episode Ever!
I had seen Conan as part of his audience twice, and he's such an amazing entertainer. He's just so genuine, and the fact that so many of his staff have stuck with him for decades speaks to the type of person he is.
If you would have told me that conan was on coke during this episode, i would 100% believe you
ALL HAIL THE GOAT!
Truly the best episode. I love hot ones, and I’ve seen all episodes and there are some really good ones. But Conans dedication to physical comedy here is just amazing to watch!
We're lucky to have Conan. One of the greatest people in entertainment. No one else is like him
Did he go to sleep on the complex couch afterwards like Coolio?
bravo conan. thank you for your service in entertainment.
Best episode yet.. would not want to be around his house that goes through.. 🔥🧯
Miracle Berries ftw
The GOAT
conan with the full senddd 🔥🔥🤣😂🤣
Yesss!
Best ever!!!!!
Best episode ever.
CONAN IS THE MAN! Woooooooow when he started drinking from the bottle… wild
His red face at the end just sent me. Why is he so good. Just like the best person I’ve seen ever in my life. He’s too perfect. Protect him.
“Wing drop!” 😂😂😂😂😂😂 I 😂 fxcking legendary
This was pure art, Conan is the GOAT
What a legend!
What a wild episode. Conan went all in! 😂
This has been the funniest episode by far! Had me rotfl!!!
The best hot ones ever! Conan is the man! He ain't no nibbler! He has set the bar!
LEGEND MATE
First guest to actually eat good amounts of all the hot sauces.conan is a BEAST!!!
This felt like a documentary of a man slowly sinking into the depth of depravity and insanity.
Conan O’Brien, by far the best guest on Hot Ones of all time! Unstoppable force of Entertainment and Destroyer of Wings! Great finale!!
Finally the funniest, coolest l, intelligent Master of the Art of making you smile. Conan O Brien.
Conan was glistening on his forehead a bot after #3 😂
This is definitely a Top 3 episode
Jordan Schlansky would’ve been a hilarious duo with Conan. We could’ve used the contrast in personalities
I haven't watched this yet but I've been waiting for this guy to be on the show for years!
WOW! 😂
Salute to conan the greatest guest
The man is a genius. In more ways than one
I was hoping for a Roland Duchesne cameo.
Best episode EVER🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤😂😂😂
If the hat at 10:45 is an ode to La Bamba I am here for it ♥️
conan is the best
22:37 The pure look of terror on Sean's face!!! hahahaha "What's this man doing?" hahahahha
That was hands down the funniest hot ones episode ever to air. Hats off Sean and Conan! I don't even care he didn't have a 9th question!
Conan is committed and crazy! Can't wait for his MAX show!
Thought this was an edit when I saw the thumbnail. Happy surprise.
GOD Tier..
This is the best one si far. Period.
Conan is my comedic hero. God bless Conan O' Brien.
My jaw hurts from grinning and laughing so hard for the last 27 minutes and 21 seconds. 😂
Masterpiece of Showbiz... I am happy to be able to see one of the most artistic court jesters... Something that would have been exclusive not long ago to the richest Kings/Queens. Great Show, great host, and what a great guest!
Yes!!!! I’ve been waiting for this 🎉
Man is actually insane
WILD
nice little souvenir, nothing like a wing in the ole pocket to remind you of the good times man.
Conan>Gordon
Conan is going to destroyyyyy his toilet.
Mistake 🤣 This was outstanding, Conan delivers!
hot ones hall of famer for sure!
If anyone commits to the bit, it's Conan. Now get Andy.
None of those sauces are hot. All professional hot pepper eaters  know that you use brown sugar on the tongue to quench the heat then drink the ice water.
ONE OF THE BEST EPISODES!!!!! CONAN IS ONE OF MY FAVE PEOPLE EVER!!! This just proves it more 😂😂😂😂
Not sitting here, feeling weird.Listening to Conan and Sean say my name repeatedly
CONAN!!!! ❤❤
This is the first time I've seen Sean genuinely unsure of what to do, Conan being the uncomfortably gangly man-toddler we've come to know and love the past 3 decades
Conan is apply named!  An absolute Monster!  LOL!
The GOAT
This has to be my all time favorite Hot Ones episode 😊
Conan has 4 years to live  -Bea Arthur's ghost.
Conan is a true showman and good human❤
this drops the same day that oj dies. i wish he talked about Norm.
outstanding show.....
Best episode ever. Hail hot wings O'Brian!
The DaBomb sauce just spilling on the table while Conan goes on his comedy rant 😂😂😂
NO LIE! The first time I saw him was late at night while I was a teenager tripping on acid. That was THE ONLY time I found him entertaining. Because his face was melting.
Lmao…I literally don’t even know what to say.  Conan is awesome
HANDS DOWN THE BEST HOT ONES EVER!  I laughed so hard!
sean looks so scared when he says its a wrap
His closing words I can appreciate
Conan with his hair set to highest-of-swoops~   Really brings you back to his old cartoon logo~
I used to not like Conan.  But this is my favorite episode of Hot Ones after Aubrey Plaza. Bravo Mr. O’Brien
This is one of the best shows! Love it!!
G. O. A. T guest.
My favourite moment was when Conan O'Brien tells Sean he's a great interviewer, I bet that made Sean's year.💖💖💖
I got so worried for Conan during Da Bomb *stressed*
Beautiful chaos from Conan as always
add captions!!
Absolute class act..this is up there, one of, if not, the best one! Bravo 👏
this was one of best and funniest episodes ever😁
"I bet you live 4 more years tops" is funny enough saying to someone young but saying it to someone who's already near death is hilarious.
Best Episode EVER lol
best guest ever
This was incredible 😂
Did that man just do a huge pour of da bomb…….. he’s not human. 😮
Wow!
Omfg 🤣🤣🤣
This is everything i thought it would be
LOL best episode yet!!! Love Conan!
Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you, The Greatest to Ever Do It, Conan O'Brien
Conan is such a funny guy.  Guy is maybe a little nuts too.  That won’t be fun coming out later.
Transcendent
I cried laughing at this.
Conan has a way of eating wings like a Chris Farley character
This man will surpass the great ones, and become the greatest of all………
this episode was so surreal. like no other episode. conan is insane. will NEVER stop watching.
"I've had so many fillers, so much botox, and they seared my tear ducts closed... These wings are nothing!" 😂
❤ Conan.
Favorite episode ever! 😂😂😂 He ate through all the wings, plus more. So awesome! 💥🔥💥
YEAHHHH, THERE HE IS! THE GOAT!
Conan has grave mouth (Shayne on Eat it or Yeet it)
Golly! What a way to end the season!
Instant classic
Conan should be live action Rick Sanchez
Is Conan ok? Haha
absolutely the best episode EVER
OH WOW I GOT TO SEE CONAN'S NEW SHOW ON MAX!!!! I DIDN'T KNOW CONAN EVEN HAD A SHOW OUT BESIDES HIS TALK SHOW. GLAD TO KNOW.
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!!! CONAN  IS LEDGEND
THE BEST GUEST EVER!  MOST ENTERTAINING GUEST EVER!!!!!!  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂crying😂😂😂
absolutely amazing interview
What did I just watch?
Next please invite Jordan Schlansky!!!
BEST Guest EVER!!! 🤣🤣🤣
There is nothing Conan will not give for his fans. 🤣🤣🤣
What the F did I just watch?!?! Hahahahahaha
From this alone I'm convinced Conan has grave mouth.
For anyone who's never seen Conan O'Brien before (the "younger" folks) this will be the moment he is pinned to their maps.
So ffing funny
I hate this. I was born '96
I also grew up with an Irish mother. Didn't taste seasoning until I was in my 20s and ate a taco.
I can finally say, an episode I enjoyed more than the Ramsay one
And he also Burns like count Dracula in the Sunlight lol
THE BEST episode yet. Conan is the funniest guy ever ❤❤❤❤
I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time. Thank you Conan.
Conan is a comical maniac and I love it
Rofl best hot ones ever!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Live action Dr. Nick. Just need the Hi Everybody!
It’s crazy how he’s 60 years old but he hasn’t slowed down a bit since he was 30
Try rubbing it in your eyes, Conan...
Dax Shepard just lost his crown.
We've found the hot wings hall of famer alright lol
That was one of the best episodes I've seen. Conan Killed it. If you had a kiddie pool of hot sauce he would have been in it fully clothed ranting about bagels.
Unlike Conan this show isnt scripted (other than the Paltrow episode- you cuck.) Thats why we love it
Best
Conan perfected the format, all hail lord conan
IRELAND!!!
He went full Conan. The best one yet.
Conan did exactly what we ever wished.
Best. Guest. Ever.
Pure gold.
Conan's a goat in talk shows, still the funniest. His outtakes outside are the best, glad he's here making more content. He's a real showman, can't wait for that show!
I love Conan!!!
that was the best hot ones yet
Conan really is an entertainer, you love to see it
CONAN CONAN CONAN!
Awesome show guys
What a compliment!!! Love Conan
Conan has to be top 3 guest on this show! this was great!!
Conan O’Brien ladies and gentlemen🔥💯😭
*_FanFuckingTastic_*
can we lose the double tables and go back to the way it used to be...come on....and the obvious president answer is JFK just for the body count...
My God. We are witnessing greatness. Conan is the greatest.
Without doubt the best episode ever
Best hot ones ever!😂 Conan is amazing!!!! The doctor 😂 WE NEED A FOLLOW UP AFTER THIS.
that was actually insane
Watching Conan O’Brien getting “high” on hot sauce with wings is the best thing I see on YouTube today.
American Irish people must be different from the rest of the Irish, because we love spice.
CONAN IS THE KING
Conan u are nasty 😂😂😂😂😂😂
22:38 Sean looks like he's staring into the eyes of Satan!
Can’t nana is the best guest ever!!! 😆 crazy
That was horrible, and I loved every second of it. Hands down the best Hot Ones episode so far!
Im definitely gonna watch Conans new show
Conan being a tryhard in the best way. That final monologue was completely unhinged. I feel juiced rn.
Ahhh man, I love this. Love Conan! And Sean did an awesome job as usual.  If you guys can get Craig Ferguson on too, it would be unreal. Thaaanks ❤
This episode is the definition of epic.
I don't believe Conan can ever not be doing a bit
dear god conan XD is he alright?
I miss Conan.
Amazing
Oh. My. Goodness.
I think he was channeling Chris Farley towards the end. 😂😂😂
👌 excellent
Bahaha. Conan is a real one for this episode of Hot Ones. This was an epic.  Top 5 episode. Conan is a legend! I LOVE CONAN!
I assume Conan “made amends” with the water buffalo by filling his freezer with it and feeding his family for 6 months.
there's no way Conan didn't watch Hot Ones religiously and made an exacting plan on how to subvert this interview in the funniest way possible.
I’m just gonna say what everyone is thinking……..Conan is 100% the most entertaining guest Hot Ones has ever had 👌
Best one yet, by far
His looks white, act like black and tolerance of asian.
I’m not the world’s biggest Conan fan, but best episode ever. 😂😂😂
The unapologetic, shameless drooling at the end. What a ride.
Is no one gonna mention that the jacket he’s wearing is literally the exact same jacket bill burr wore on hot ones? Ok well I said it
Oh my goodness!!!!❤️😌.
Sigo volviendo para leer los comentarios ante increíble episodio . Go conan
He's the greatest of all time
I love Conan O'Brien, there it is.
best hot ones episode ever, man i love Conan so much
CONAN IS NOT F'ING AROUND!
24:15 Conan spitting facts, strong delivery, legendary moment
WOW speechless.
That’s why I love Conan 🤣👏crazy mf
Fantastic episode!!!!
100% dedicated to his bit...he was in pain but played it off well.  Conan has been my favorite talk show host by far.  His style of humor was always captivating.  Borderline shock factor and having fun.  The ending speech is epic.
This was an all timer, well done Sean and Conan 👏
JORDAN SCHLANSKY NEXT
what a legend
So I'm guessing connan is pretty much the goat now lol
The ramp up of this episode is like the perfect metaphor for Scoville scaling.
This interview is equal to the water buffalo 😂😂😂
“Ohhhh what’s gonna happen?!” Then proceeds to drink the sauce from the bottle. 😂 what a menace.
He can brag he doesn't feel the hotness, but you can see his colors changing significatively. Such a pro!
That might be the biggest dose of da bomb. Trophy this man at end of year but make it all time. Not to mention he took the butn so well the whole time! He actually ate the wings
This is probably the best hot ones guest ever. I love you Conan
I literally yelled NO! when the doc cracked the bomb.
How did he survive this?!?!!! So unhinged but I love it
Conan is pure Adrenaline 🤣
Iconic
ABSOLUTELY SAVAGE .......legendary episode
This is the type of comedy we need.
Man Conan took it to the next level😅😅😅i got tears of joy
2 masters at their craft
Conan is such a great guest! HE DELIVERED! respect
Is this man still alive?
My favorite talk show host of all time. I love Conan
Best guest ever.  That was a wild ride!
"The other guy.." this is one of the many reasons I love Conan
YEAHH CONAN!!!!!
PLEASE GET JEFF ARCURI ON HERE. HE WILL BE AWESOME!
My parents didn't let me watch "late night" tv but they would wake me up to watch some of Conan's skits back in like uhhhhh.... 1994? I was like 6-7 years old. I've grown up always respecting the amount of character that Conan O'Brien has put into his work, and I've followed him from then until now. He's obviously very funny but even to this day I will always look up to him as a very intelligent, very compassionate, very deliberate, and very empathetic person.
Funniest episode ever
This is the start of Conan's downward spiral with hot sauce addiction.
I'm dying at how messy, snotty and drooly he is by the end. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The best Hot Ones ever.
conan is king for a reason 😌👑
But I thought redheads had a LOWER pain threshold!!!
That was great! Conan is awesome
He is hilarious 😂
Best guest ever!!!! Respecc!!
Conan TheHotSauceKing!
This was unhinged, and I couldn't be happier
Haha huge Conan fan from the first days, love seeing him going HARD here! So many laughs!!
Conan's face must hurt soooo bad ... But still being funny😂 is hilarious.
this is the greatest episode of hot ones ever recorded
About time someone made this funny. Since season 6 nobody actually eats a whole wing and feels it. They take the smallest bite and go crazy about heat. Conon just destroyed next guests that will be on. Best episode so far!!
Conan!!!!!
23 seasons, best episode ever
I was in awe. My jaw broke from my face at "ARE WE DOING IT OR NOT????" 👹
Amazing! Haha
Who is that guy getting interviewed on Conan's Hot Ones ?
this was AWESOME ! top 5 episodes 💪🏼💪🏼
I don’t know how y’all keep topping yourselves 😂 the Beyoncé of interview shows
is it just me but the video has some stuttering parts?
The GOAT Hot Ones
ty
Worst hot ones ever. -comic book guy
best episode yet
Conan is our greatest living comedian
Solid episode 10/10 😂😂😂
"And the award for all time greatest hot ones guest goes to..."
We are watching the best YouTube video of the week 🎉
Conan is THE BEST!
This... this is EPIC.
Conan’s a boomer.  They’re built different.  Man obliterated this challenge.
Wow. 1million views within 8hrs. I totally understand. Did a little gasp when I saw this ❤❤❤
The best episode of Hot Ones, EVER.
He loves his ice cream, one of his favs is Sweet Rose Creamery in Brentwood!
Now I want to know how Conan felt after this.
The best interview on Hot Wings hands down!!! This is pure madness, I love it! Share to the whole world!
Conan is as mad as he is high at the end. Spectacular display of professionalism and dedication to comedy. He was amazing as a host, never joined the club, stayed true to himself and can still rock'n'roll like no tomorrow. Well done!
❤ my favorite episode ever❤
Probably top 3 best Hot Ones episode ever. Conan is the goat!
CONAN KILLED IT!!!
Best episode yet. No contest. Conan is a gift.
Conan is insane lol
Now if only Paul Rudd crashed the interview to show them a clip from his new movie.
What a MAD MAN
Conan is the GOAT! Best episode ever!
GOATED!!
what an absolute psychopath!!! Greatest of ALL TIME What a freaking LEGEND
This is the best Hot Ones episode so far. A major milestone.
LOVE !!!!!
Conan the goat!!
There are coma patients, there are introverts, there are extroverts, and then there is Conan..
he’s gonna regret that so bad - there is a line you can cross where you get severe stomach pain and then puke
This is one of the greatest episodes of all time
An all time episode. Been waiting years for this, and it's perfect.
Amazing!
those last few sauces were wild. Conan is that guy.
Charlie Rose with hot sauce... 🔥🤣😂
He is simply the best
LEGEND
Definitely the best episode. No one has manhandled sauces like Conan!
Seeing Conan just straight up drink the last dab was one of the funniest and most impressive things seen on this show.
the absolute goat.
Thank you so much Hot Ones for having Conan on! 🎉 First time I laughed hard watching a hot ones episode 😂
ROFLHOLYSHIT!!! Conan looked insane towards the end there. So good I was crying😂😂🤣
Sean, this is the Hot Ones magnum opus. 10/10
😂
Best episode ever! Thank you Conan, you are awesome!
This is the most animated, over the top episode ever. Conan goes so hard he should probably be committed.
Conan O'Brian, the Dad of the Internet and talk shows. A man who would actually be cool with the kids because he could match their energy tenfold. His fuel is hotsauce.
Seeing Travel Texas, which is through the governor's office, is the episode sponsor is super disappointing.
Amazing performance.
absolutely incredible
I love Conan
Conan is the GOAT. I love how much he delivered for this
That was one of the funniest performances I've seen in a long time
Day One certified classic
nobody has ever made me laugh as hard as Conan.   it's was sad when he left late night. he's so fun to watch. none of these late night hosts have yet to fill his shoes. his comedy is flawless.   bring him back!!!!!!!
❤‍🔥
I think this is the most Sean has ever laughed in an interview
He starts off as a talkshow host, but ends up as Baron Harkonnen.
Arguably the best hot ones interview ever. Just ridiculously, sensationally good. Although it should be noted, Conan has always had a weird relationship with pain. He's demonstrated on more than one occasion that he's into it.
117,000 likes in 8 hours!!
UNHINGED!!!
Other guests: Bring their drink of choice for spicy food Conan: Brings his own physician
Dr. Arroyo needs to be a reoccurring character!
To people like Conan and I, it’s not a bit…we live like this.
What a legend. Hopefully those unfamiliar with Conan and the show's past hilarity have a good time going down the rabbit hole.
Maniac.
This is hilarious. But I got to say, Sean just going with it made it even better. Wow!
He must have eaten a miracle berry, which blocks spice before he came on the show.
Love Simpsons writing Conan, funny bit Conan and Man on The Street Conan.   Don't care for conversation Conan.
Prolly my new fav episode ❤❤
How????  How????  How????
“So was it a 4 year medical school?” … it was supposed to be  😂
!!!!!!!CONAN O’BRiEN!!!!!
This is probably one of the best episodes
This is the episode for which all others will be compared.
I think Sean sums it up nicely when he kept saying “INCREDIBLE! INNNCREDIBLE!”
Conan's last interview... haha
Viva!
OMFG What a Legenddddd!!! 😂 Live Life!!!! Much Love Conan!!
Legend
What an animal. Unreal. I was worried for him at the end there. Im gonna watch his show out of respect for this.
Best episode ❤
"Charlie Rose with chicken wings" is the best.
That was AMAZING - he is the GOAT
Conan is the greatest guest on hot ones.
This was legit!! Wow. Can we thumbs up this more than once???
This will forever be the best episode
Conan has taken the crown 👑
Conan has owned this more than any other guest !11111111
Can you try and get OJ Simpson on next season?  edit: nevermind
CONAN IS A LEGEND!!!!!!
Easily the best episode of this show, ever
My friends used to say he was like a crazy person that someone just gave a television show too and we all loved him for it.
Shout out to Conan
Absolute Gold!
Welcome to the most watched episode of Hot Ones. You’re in good company.
I LOVE CONAN!!!!!
Conan is absolutely the BEST talk show host of all time.
He’s possibly the sexiest man to ever live
I can only assume Conan sat on a toilet for the next 10 hours.
😳🤒😰🥵 😄😆😂🤣
... this is the most over the top I've seen anyone I figured Da Bomb would humble him... NOPE
FINALLY!!!!
Conan brings a bit 10 seconds in.... thank you Conan for being you.
Hilarious! Never seen his face redder than his hair
Now that's a finale!
This really proves Conan will do anyyyyything for the laugh. 🤣
Greatest of all time.... I am stunned.
Holy cow, this interview is insane in the best way possible.  What a way to close out the season!
Conan has been playing us all; he's really Mexican.
This legit has to be the best guest yet.
Bro, just use one table again. ☠
What a boss. This is already legendary episode. Connan is the 🥵 ones🐐
Bruh -_-..... this is unmatched. Slow Clap. Hats off to you good sir!
🐐 🐐 🐐 🐐 🐐 🐐 🐐 🐐 🐐
lol, Man ain't human.
Thank you Conan for entertaining us for so many years. Your commitment to making this episode great for Sean and his audience is so awesome! Wonderful work!
Conan is the goat! Maybe the best episode ever.
The best and only GOOD late night host!
This was so chaotic and amazing. I love Conan❤
I'd never thought I would see the day Conan would make Steve-O look like Greta Thunberg.
Sean didn’t match his guest
LETS GOOOOO!!!!!🚀🚀🚀🚀
Best – Finale – EVER.
Conan last dabbed so many wings. G.O.A.T.
This is a massive achievement for humanity
1M views already in 9 hours just shows you what you need to know about this legend! Best hot ones episode probably ever! Team Coco for life!
Conan is the best.
ABSOLUTE LEGEND
The best one yet
The true Lisan al Gaib! What a legend!!
❤❤❤❤❤ he has outed everyone else who has been on this show!!!
Amazing
Is it still alive after this show?
This one's gonna be hard to top. I think he just de-crowned Paul Rudd for me
Yooooo!! Conan was the best😂
I can't believe i lived to see this Iconic moment!
there should be a viewer discretion advised warning that the last part of this episode might disgust viewers
This is the best episode ever. Hahaha what a legend.
Love and miss you Conan! ❤❤❤
Conan did this and OJ Simpson died!!!!
Pure genius.
I love how Conan is so humble and down to earth
Conan = great performer. Sean = great interviewer.
Best episode yet!
I love Conan with all my heart. Since the 90s... this is the first time I actually said the words out loud "he's a MADMAN" 😅
GOAT!
This after going on a 9-hour binge of old Conan clips yesterday!?!? Maybe the universe **is** designed for me!
😂😂😂 one of the beeeesst!!!!!!!!!
The amount of views ( 1.1 million so far and 15,000 comments ) shows how much Conan is loved!!!!!
Best episode so far. Conan owns this show now.
Conan is an absolute LEGEND!!
One of the best guests ever.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍🏽
best episode ever conan is timeless
one of my fav episode 🔥
Christ is he still alive
Absolute genius! Def one for the books…”old or New Testament”
We need a new host. Sean is just flavorless at this point.
THE GOAT. New best hot ones!
This is one of the best thing can ever happen. Conan+Hot wings.
Say what you want but Conan is a bad bad mf
Conan is wild
I imagine a Jim Carrey Hot Ones would be similar to this.
I love Conan he’s so naturally funny
Conan is very intelligent only problem is his loves to us about it
Thanks for the bringing a piece of Farley back mr Conan  Go Buffalo
Bro really kept the chewed wings
I give him 4 years, tops.
He beat Gordon Ramsay 😂
This is without a doubt...the best hot ones episode ever.
I hope he goes to Finland and finally gets to meet Forss Fagerstrom. All these years later, and I still haven't stopped laughing...
He's crazy lol😂😂😂
Definitely a fire way to close things out
1 million views in 8 hours? Conan is the BEST
Ice spice could NEVER!!
Conan is the best
Best episode ever.
I think Conan just broke the interview.
Conan's contour is lookin' real cute.
Wicked end of the season, compared to the past few folks on the show. Conan is comedy god. More please.
Best episode of this show I've ever seen.
Conan both perfected and destroyed the show.
He disrespected tf outta the last 3 sauces 😂😂 😂
I'm shocked they're still using 2 circle tables put together instead of one long 6 ft+ table this far into the series
Conan is officially my hero. An unhinged comedy legend 🔥🫡
Hate to say it....but I would find it hard to ever top this episode.  Like..end the show now because it won't get better than this.   I'm joking of course...but kinda not.
Get jordan Schlansky on! 😂😂😂😂😂
THIS... IS... ENTERTAINMENT!!!!
Might have been the best outro on Hot Ones
One interview. Two absolute legends.
This came just in time as I just started my monthly Conan O'Brien YouTube binge.
Guest of the year 100%
I love Connan, one of the funniest humans ❤😂
Didn’t know Conan still did coke till this episode. Respect.
my god. this level of craziness is definitely up there with Steve-O pouring the hot sauce into his eyes.  what a finale!
I think this has to be the best Hot Ones episode. Conan is legenadary.
conan is a genius and a savage
oh my god, I'm hurting sooooo much. I knew I had to watch this one and what a season ender lol. Conan is unbelievably funny and add that....spice lol... and he was bound to go a bit off the rails lol. So good.
My favourite episode to date. Always loved Conan and this was fantastic.
I’ve been a fan since the first episode of his show back in the 90s. Just so happened thst my grandma was a fan of comedy and late nite shows and let me stay up for the premiere. She loved how weird he was and how much he looked like my recently deceased grandfather. It was our thing we did when I got to stay over. Good times.
Best interview ever
Peak Hot Ones
The best of all! Love Conan, an amazing entertainer
The greatest to ever do it   Both being a talk show host and being a hot one’s guest.
How can anyone follow this? The comedy is everywhere monologue at the end...crying giggling dead
He looks like the sick triceratops from Jurassic Park by the end of this 😂😂😂
😂
AMAZING !
Sean's look of pure terror at the Lovecraftian Horror Conan became is priceless.
Conan has one of the greatest minds, he’s an excellent entertainer. He’s topped the hot ones catalogue entirely 😂
My comedic idol and hero.
I've been here since day one. Conan is by far the best interview to date. He literally double killed it. Hope he is okay after all that. 😂😂
this is insane. amazing show
maniac
“This one, I’m not gonna lie- I’m feeling it.  I’m feeling it a little bit”.     😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Epicccccc
I've never seen Sean break so hard, this was lovely
This was historic. Conan O'Brian, a literal living legend. Thank you sir. You've managed to stay on top for so long and it looks like you're nowhere near stopping.
Conan is the funniest person to ever live.
Legendary
7:53 LOLLLLLLLLL "It's there"  We getting are high medicals bills money's worth right there ha
''Can I keep these?'' Classic Conan..
What a fantastic lunatic!
Sorry Conan, you have a great poker face but as a fellow Irish American the sweat coming out of every pore in your face and forehead betrays you 😂
He definitely owned "Da bomb". If he didnt pour it on the wing he probably would've not felt it
Greatest episode of Hot Ones ever. No contest.
Conan #1 in Hot Wings 🪽 of fame!!!!!
That was a DUMMY'S foot hitting that trainer in the face! You can see the HAND holding it!  CONAN IS A FRAUD!!!
If the buzzing sound of the fire coming from the chicken's beak in the intro ever goes away, my quality of life is plummeting
Conan O'Brien + hot wings = Lewis Black
Judging by Coolio, how many years does Conan have to live now?
I admire Conan so much. This was amazing.
🎉🎉 HE CAME THROUGH BIGG 👏🏽👏🏽
It's an interview of an interviewer interviewing and interviewer.
Okay, for a second, I thought that really was his doctor. Wow. Now that is good acting lol.
Conan is goated. It is just that simple.
This is the best one. I've been wanting Conan to be on this show forever.
this has got to be the most funny, crazy and out-of-mind episode ever. What a great guest Conan was… never heard Sean laugh this much EVER
This was amazing xD
Conan will you bring jordan with you
so many good moments. conan is THE BEST!! 😂😂😂
That is how you wrap the Michael Jordan of seasons😂
What a chad, commit to the bit until the last wing
Can someone check on him now 😂😂 check his heart
I cannot believe he got one of his writers to come and pretend to be his doctor for a bit that’s so funny
Love this person ❤
Hats off to Conen O Brien. incredible !!
Every time I see a Conan interview, I love him a little more
Oh, that's not gonna be good on the way out 😂😂😂
After Ice Spice being a wall of shame member, Shakira was great. I didn’t think this is what we would get next 😂 LOVED IT!
The best one ever
now do ferguson
After Ice Spice being a wall of shame member, Shakira was great. I didn’t think this is what we would get next 😂 LOVED IT!
I knew that this episode would be fire even if i haven't played the video
Conan is a LEGEND!! What a great finale - everything and more I’ve ever imagined. ❤
We need Stephen Colbert
Simply amazing!! Conan is the BOSS.
Instant classic
Must be amazing experience for anyone to be interacting with conan...he is such a legend. Extrememely intelligent , hilarious and never stops to share wisdom....
BEST EP EVER CONAN THE GOAT
They say red heads have a higher tolerance of pain.
Beste Episode so far
THIS REALYY WAS THE BEST ONE YET!!!!!! KRAZY CONAN!!!!!!
This was by far the best Hot Ones ever !!!!!!!!!
Legendary!!!
Historic Will Never Be Topped 🥹🥀
So perfectly executed. Conan 👏👏👏 My god. Amazing
Conan is now mexican
This and Dave grohl are probably the best ones
THE CONE ZONE
that was the greatest acting ever 😂
toooo much coke xd
My god was that worth the watch
Conan is a national treasure and he must be protected at all costs. What a great episode!
If you are looking for the water buffalo clip on YouTube watch?v=LlrRjPMlRkg
Dude his left eye is bleeding
Was waiting to hear Max Weinberg’s name get dropped as the kids say
By far one of the best episodes yet! 😅❤
Absolute legend
His eyes matched his hair.
It's almost like he was hypnotized to not feel spice.
Absolutely unhinged and I love it. I am absolutely going to watch his new show.
This was legendary
In all my years of watching this show, I've never seen anything like this XD.
THE BEST TO EVER DO IT
Not only was that the best Hot Ones, that was the best Conan!   We're in tears with stitches of laughter spiced with fear for his crazy audacity and admiration for his ability to ride out pain with wild humor.  PURE COMEDY GOLD!!! 🤣🤣🤣
So refreshing to see Conan interviewed for a change
This was the GREATEST episode of hot ones I have ever seen
Worthy to be a series finale
Ok...this guy needs to be my Joker
Love Conan
This is the best episode in all 23 seasons.
Conan O'Brien wins Hot Ones
Uhm…no
Now. Who is going to top this episode
Eight hours since launch and 200k views in the period of time that I watched the episode. This is what #1 Trending means. Congrats @FirstWeFeast! Conan. Dear lord, Conan.
If he ran for president....😂..🎉🍻
Ahaha...such a funnyman...man, he does hot good 🔥🔥🔥
Maybe a few drinks before the show lol
Sometiems I fantasize that Conan was my highsteacher at times. So funny and knows a lot about a lot of stuff while his assistant teacher is Jordan with his various tasks in class
Can I just take a second and say “This is starting to hit”.
Conan channeling his inner Farley
This is the funniest episode I've watched! Conan's freakouts are so hilarious!🤣🤣
I love seeing all of the appreciation of Conan in these comments. He’s the best
I can honestly say this is one of if not the best episode out.  Conan was tge only late night show i love to watch besides ferguson. Well done Conan
Conan restores my faith in humanity.
Did Conan somehow dethrone Eric Andre for most unhinged Hot Ones episode?? Yes, yes he did.
the...BEST hot ones EVER. AMazing,
Im crying hahahahaha
Being here before the memes is a priceless feeling
I still can't believe this man co-wrote the best episodes of The Simpsons. He's a walking comedic genius.
This was incredible 😮😂🎉
CONAN!!!❤
Conan one of a kind his ability to make anything funny is crazy lol 😂
This has to be the best episode I’ve ever seen!  Conan is the absolute GOAT!
“My intestines have turned into acid but I can still remember the plug,that’s a professional.” 😂😂😂 this gotta be a top 10 episode
A million views in 8 hours,  I love Conan
"You can't predict the future" - from the man who predicted Bea Arthur's death.
this man helped me during hard times with his comedy. Man i love conan :)
😂🎉😮
Conando!
best episode ever
Craig Ferguson please!
There’s been some contenders, but this is surely the best (hot) one ever?
Those wings looked way too clean. There wasn’t any sauce on them. Unless it’s just dots of sauce.
Conan literally shows up with a real life Simpsons character. Everything the doctor said was hilarious and delivered perfectly. Conan might be the funniest man alive
i can't believe it's been 23 years of Hot Ones
Not sure who is the better Conan interviewer, Sean Evans or Kevin Nealon
Why can't I FEEL?! ... lol
Happy bitrhday!
"my pockets getting full" 😭😭
I lost my head when he drank from the bottle. Conan is a savage!
I did not expect Conan to go that hard
Poor DJ Khaled. I guess you are what you don't eat.
Rip Conan’s backside and toilet later
I love that he just calls Leno, "The Other Guy" hahaha
After trying The Last Dab myself, I was wincing HARD. What Conan did was no small feat guys.
Once Conan got to the 3rd or 4th last wing, he suddenly turned into Chris Farley with his joke and delivery style.
This GOTTA be the best episode EVEEEEEEEERRRR...!!!
In regards to being able to take the heat, I haven’t seen anyone else drink the hot sauces and pour them on multiple wings like that. Crazy episode, R.I.P Conan 🤣🤣
The best episode of hotones ever!!! Conan O' Brien is the man I've watched him since the early 2000s. He is a true comedic genius. I love you, Conan. Thank you for being an absolute savage
Incredible!
Conan does Conan the man is a inspiration and is one of the few talk show host I have nothing but respect for.
New GOAT!
I applauded from home.
Such a great episode
best one yet! he straight up killed it! i wanna know how he felt afterwards 😅😂
THE CHAOS xddd
conan is the final boss
I cannot adequately put into words how much I love Conan. This episode is instant legend. Laughed so hard my nose is running.
Legend
dude is so much funnier without the shackles of cable TV
I have not laughed that hard in a while. Amazing.
I need more Conan. Conan is the biggest champion ever
I LOVED THIS!
Thank you for having Conan. He is a joy.
I’m a huge Conan fan and he did not disappoint on this episode, however I am 12.5 weeks pregnant and not gonna lie I did dry heave at the end 😂
best episode yet
This was the most unhinged guest I've ever seen haha
GOAT🍻
Sean Evans, please have Nardwuar soon 👏🏼
Absolute mad lad
I was laughing so hard I had tears rolling down my face!!!!! Best episode ever!!!!!
this is why Conan is king
Conan is the GOAT
Conan is the G.O.A.T what an interview!
Conan would love Akira Toriyama I wonder if he's read manga
I love u coco
Sona next please
That was EASILY the funniest episode of the series.
I didn’t think this would be good…  This ended up being one of the most beautiful cinematic adventures I’ve ever been apart of.
I’m crying this was the funniest hot ones
Conan is crazy! Its great!
I im laughing mybass to the ball hahaha
We must protect Conan O’Brien at all costs
I love Conan. This was amazing
I've never seen Sean so scared and in awe at the same time lol. That was amazing
🇺🇸🇺🇦‬❤‬🤍‬💙💛🌹🇮🇱‬🤍💙‬
Conan is a Man among men
Best yet! Kudos to everyone involved👍🏻
So Shakira wasn’t the end of the season.
Great funny guy
Pure Conan.
I knew Conan was starting to get in trouble when he switched to drinking milk. His face was rosy red on the last one.
I’ve never seen so much color in Conan’s pale Irish face 😂
Best episode ever!!!! Conan is the king
Yee Gods, Conan is a Barbarian! well done.
👍👍👍❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🐔🐔🐔
Simply amazing episode from start to finish.  Wow
What   a needy   attention seeker...    max gross
Not gonna lie, this is the best episode of Hot Ones ever. This is the essence of why the show is made. Beautiful!
Conan is him.
This is why conan is my favorite comedian! 😂 He's so chaotic. It's freaking great!
Best one yet!!!! 😭😭😭
That was pure funny.
2:25 in already guffawing
Hands down. The greatest hot ones episode ever! Just wow Conan, you are the man!
i only watch because of conan
My hero. Conan O'Brien is the greatest showman on earth!
Wow this doctor gig is hilarious.  This is probably the best episode I have seen, I love Conan, I just really hope it not faked, but I just don't think this show would do that.
It’s almost a little off putting to see Conan be serious!! Still one of the greats though
Mans' endorphins running on overdrive by the last 2 sauces
Wow.. that was.. That was.. Holy cow 🔥
The way he was waving the hot sauce around like a gun, while foaming at the mouth giving his big speech is absolutely comedy gold. What a legend, the best interview on this show, it goes down in history.
Conan is the GOAT
Conan is the GOAT
All I hear is Timon 🤣
Wow.... That's all I got.
Im watching april 18th
Conan!! One of the best comedians ever created by GOD himself! The BEST late night comedian ever created. I love you, Conan!
I bet he wouldn't do it unless he could do bits, contractually 😂
as always, a genius
The homie gonna have gastritis,  esophagitis and anositis
Conan is such a legend. Hilarious.! 😂😂
Conan's the best
"What's wrong with me, why can't I feel" worth it for this alone
I have been waiting for this.
Best episode I've ever seen
Conan's doctor was good but Conan should have asked Diana, his former intern (and student driver driving Ice Cube, Kevin Hart, and Conan around) to be the doctor in this bit.
Best episode ever!!!!
Conan's the 🐐
I just saw this thumbnail and don't even need to watch it to know it's a top 5 episode. Conan is a legend.
Lol Seans concerned look was probably worth the watch.
king of interviews
BEST episode EVER!!!! Conan is the fn man!!!
This is why the older Gen is superior
This was an absolutely great interview. One for the books. “ I am, what I am. I said it and Gandhi said it.”
I love his dead on impression of Andy “don’t get on THAT” 😂
Conan is the best guest of all time.
Conan is literally a legend
I want Sona's version of what happened after they finished filming
got too early one of the best guests ever 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I've never seen such a chaotic episode where the questions and answers still held up
This was like a Jimi Hendrix solo of hot wing interview TV performance.
This will go down in Hot Ones history as the most off-the-wall, crazy interview/performance ever. I mean maybe, MAYBE someone may do something funny and bonkers enough to match the lunatic humour of it all, but I don't think anyone will ever voluntarily and repeatedly abuse their body again so much to get a laugh.
he is so wishy washy - skip it
Conan is unhinged 😂👍
Man I just love Conan. Fantastic interview
Dr. Aroyyo is a full on Groucho Marx bit
God that was the best one in a long time
It felt like a Norm Macdonald tribute.
I don't even have the words for how hysterical this was. Conan at his chaotic best.
CONAN O'BRIAN IS THE MUTHAF***ING GOAT!!!!!!💯💯💯
That was … AMAZING. CONAN IS NO QUESTION THE HOT ONES GOAT! Not even close.
This is a guy who has said he would get shot if it made people laugh. There was no way he would not get to the end.
This is without question the best one I have ever seen.
I'd love to see Conan and Jordan eat the wings of death together!
Conan is the biggest Hot Ones champ ever!
Someone needs to study Conan's brain and I mean that in the best way possible haha the fact that he can make it through this all for the bit is insane.
Put a legend in the chair, receive a legendary performance.
All Hail KING Conan!..guy took over and dominated the entire show
#1 best ever
The GOAT
He came in and had the best hot ones show, this was probably a big moment for Conan to be the best guest in a show he respected when he's been the best host for so long!
Loved this episode!!! Conan is awesome!
If Conan passes before me I’ll die
16:52 that’s gonna be a meme that feeds generations 😂😂😂😂
As a guy named Max, it was cool to hear Conan say my name multiple times as a joke on HBO.
Conan's an idiot! Great episode
What is my guy doing
YIPPIIEEE
I ❤ Conan!
only conan can go on a drunken tyrade off of hot sauce au the end 😂
Easily the best showing in all of hot wings history
What an absolute mad man! Just saw what he did with Da Bomb.
Undisputed. One of the best episodes ever on Hot Ones. No longer The Last Dab. It’s “The Last Pour” and/or “The Last Drench”
I think Sean looked legitimately concerned after Conan started drinking the last sauce.
The funniest video I've ever seen, but I figured as much when I saw Conan.
I'm not  being hyperbolic when I say, my sides ache from laughter.  Twice I was brought to tears from the absolute comic genius that is Conan O'Brien.  There is a reason he has been named the greatest interview in Howard Stern history, now he brings those skills to one of the best interviewers on the internet. With that said,  I hope he is recovering nicely.
Bestest episode ever
This was 11/10 conan. Unhinged.
Already liked. I cant wait for this!!
So was there a pile of snow just off camera oooooor.... ?
Jordan Schlansky is watching this be like
Conan Literally is The Flaming C
I was not expecting this episode to go this way
The BEST episode ever!!! Thanks!!!
I wish I could see Chris Farley on here rip Chris
As someone who moderately likes this show, I can safely say this is the best episode.
OK this is not a comment, but the question is Conan O’Brien a Juggalo if so, whoop whoop Homie
I used to stay up late as a kid to watch late night with Conan O'Brian. It brought me much joy growing up
He is a comedy giant. That bit about putting the wings in his pocket is pure Marx Bros energy.
GOATed
He's a pirate. Just born a few centuries too late. Aaarrrgggghhh Conan.
man this is going down as one of the best hot ones!!
Never respected Conan more.
14:04 My Lord, this man is bonkers
"You're not a doctor, are you?    I should be." 🤣🤣
Conan is a beast he killed it and always funny good job staying on track with him Sean he likes to run off the rails sometimes lol
-is Connan the best guest on Hot Ones yet? -YES
came prepared with the doc bit, smashed through the sauce and didn't even fumble once, a true pro
No episode will top this
Everybody needs to see this one what a menace
S C A R Y He went too far emulating Bill Murray in Little Shop of Horrors 😬
Hands down my favorite so far you have won me back
It's like he never left. It's like his just starting.
I'm so excited for this! Conan O'Brien is one of my favorite people of all time!
Sean looks horrified
I love Conan
This is my ADHD manifested
Was waiting for Jordan schlanksy to pop out
I can’t stop laughing 😂😂😂
I never thought he could top the spicy jalapenjoes but here we are 😱
I have not seen this side of Conan lol Coco was goin THROUGH it
Fanfuckingtastic!
The best episode, the goat doing hot wings with his multi-talented doctor at hand. Thank you First we Feast
I had no idea Conan has a very awesome work ethic. Do what you Gotta do and get it done.
now, i wanna know who could top this performance!? maybe jim carrey...
Wow! Conan cannot be topped! 🔥
Legendary
This is the best hot ones episode ever bar none. I feel comfortable saying that after it being released a couple hours ago.
Honestly I lost interest in this show after they stopped showing sean eating the wings as well.  Part of the fun was watching sean suffer with the guests and they changed that paradigm.  Boring....
Is he on coke?
Outstanding.
Sean, this was one of your best yet. What a score gettin Coco!
Guy is 60 and he ate like a champ
Best episode ever!!!
Just finished this episode and it legit is the best one yet i clapped so loud and cheered so loud amazing work
Phenomenal
Can @FirstWeFeast verify that those hotsauces weren't watered down or tampered with??? Cause his go through with it is INSANE.
Will be hard to top that episode..think conan is funnier than any comedian out there now
Right up until now I always thought Conan is a bit strong name for this slim awkward guy, Now I definitely know I wouldn't want to be on the opposite side in a battle. Hooooly f...
Conan for President
The drool, we bow to you Conan! We are happy you’re here!
He made Steve-O look normal!😳😂
I haven't been this entertained in years...if ever
kinda galvanized my childhood love for conan. w
I wish this was two hours long
Better than Gordon Ramsey! The best Hot Ones ever! EVER!
This was indeed the Greatest Hot ones Episode ever!!!!!
Who is this goofy guy? 🤨 He needs his own show 🙂 Team Coco ❤️
The absolute best.
This might be the best episode yet!!!
Da Bomb truly is in a class of its own. It’s really the only reason I watch lol. Gets everyone every time
This has definitely been the best everrrrrrrrrr!!!!! Your da best CO♡ And pleaaaase invite Tom Hardy!!!!
This was the greatest episode ever.  Hot Ones will never top this masterpiece.
I couldn’t wait to get home from work to watch this!  I adore Conan so much.
He called Dr Arroyo over just to hand him a wing because he ran out of pockets 😂😂😂
I thought i was tired of this show…. Well nit anymore - depends on the guest 😊
Jesus Christ.
@17:23 Was that one of Sean's hiccuburps? Or did Conan sit on a honking clown nose? Either way . . . this is the best it will ever be.
Conan is one of the all time greats and always will be. This was honestly one of the greatest episodes of hot ones, if not one of the greatest interviews ever done.
The Legend
Love you Conan! ❤❤❤
I almost feel like Conan took a few novacaine shots for this 😅😂
The best episode!!!!!!!! ❤
I love Conan so much
I have seen every single episode this will live in my brain for years  in tears
THAT was awesome sauce. Chef's kiss to both men and congratulations on a great season, Sean & team! 🎉
he is a tough old goat
I give it to Conan on this one for sure.
Simply the BEST!!
The doctor bit is ingenious and so hilarious
Every time Conan said a wing was light work it made me anticipate Da Bomb more.
This has beat what Paul Rudd and Shia did on their episodes .
i think he beats lorde in the idgaf war
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hall of fame episode.
Best episode that I’ve seen in quite some time. Conan is a legend
Conan is wild for this. This is my favourite episode hands down.
What a gangster.
I’ve never been a huge Conan fan but now…… he has a new place in my heart that I didn’t know existed 😂
The Dr. Arroyo bit was a nice addition I love Conan
Conan is the new king of the wings.
The greatest hot ones interview of all time!
Is this what not having a soul is like?
Easily one of the best episodes of Hot Ones ever. Maybe even better than Ramsey’s legendary appearances
Hats off to Conan he is one of the greatest.
I figured one of the GOAT hosts would also be one of the GOAT guests but who knew he would handle the spice that well?  Legend!  That man is a freak, who needs to be protected at all times, im such a huge fan.
Legend
Savage.
Conan is an absolute LEGEND. Nothing will ever beat this episode!
I thought I couldn't respect Conan any more, but then he dropped this monster of a performance!
😂😂fitting for a last episode of the seasonn
Conan is the bomb
Haha conan’s a legend!! How is he immune!🤣
Conan is the very rare human you are always guaranteed to be truly entertained by no matter what he's doing. I love him and look forward to watching his new show.
Conan is the best
Conebone69
Love conan gg
His skin may wrinkle, but his hair will forever be youthful. Long live the Conan Tsunami hair.
This is absolutely one of the best Hot One's interview I've seen. That was legendary Conan! Bravo 👏 👏 👏 😂😂😂
❤
Never knew why Conan was something. Still don't.
wing drop!
Absolute legend.
Legendary episode.
This was by far one of my favorite episodes Conan the Destroyer
Funniest ever! 😂
Conan is a madman!
This is legitimately the hardest ive laughed in years.... thank you conan
Love Conan's instant regret face lol
Peak entertainment: watching Conan overdose on hot sauce…
Okay, this might've just taken my 1st place spot for funniest episode.
You know what else looks like a hot wing? His head. You know whats more tasteless than Irish food? Irish comedy.
25:18
ohh man this guy is amazing! there will be no other Conan.
channeling some chris farley energy in places here, dang conan
Best Episode Ever.
I love this man. What a national treasure.
there was a party later that day, in Conan's toilet.
What an incredible  end of season!! CONAN IS SUCH A LEGEND
Why isn't he wearing his Haiti shirt?
What a madman. Nobody will ever top this.
This was a great show. It reminded me of why I don't watch Conan O'Brien's TV show. His humor is sophomoric, and I feel he never graduated from being the class clown
Conan pocketing the wing remains 😂
I'm so happy Conan took it like a champ.
I can't believe what I just witnessed. Conan is Da Bomb!
Best episode ever 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Loved watching Conan in the 90’s and early 2000’s. One of the funniest guys out there. 🍀
Conan is an absolute showman! Who in the world can commit to the perfomance in this way? What a finale, BRAVO!
You should have Pat McAfee do this show
Impressive. That’s all I gotta say
Easily the best episode of Hot Ones. Conan brought his A+ game!
the thumbmnail lol makes conan to pail hahah 😆
Best. Guest. Ever.
He’s affordable.🙂
i've loved Conan for over 20 years, the best out there
Power over Spice is power over all
I love Conan ❤❤❤❤❤
This was the most unhinged episode I’ve ever seen 🤣 I have loved Conan since I was a baby, and wow… he delivered.  No surprise there.  I hope he didn’t legitimately burn his skin !
if this isn't the best episode, I don't know what is 😂
Conan always brings me to tear, I should not have watched this while getting my kids to sleep. My wife kept giving me the look of death.😂
God bless this mans toilet
I have loved this man since the 90s.
Funniest episode I ever seen
best in a while
I thought his overconfidence would destroy him, but it turns out that he was just confident
Referring to Jay Leno as “the other guy” lol
I heard my husband in the next room dying of laughter. Of course I ran over and said what?! He couldn't stop laughing. I was like I don't think I'm going to laugh at this. But the mediocre president part really had me chuckling. And I love Conan's awesome explanation of comedy.
Best episode of a all time!
This is a great episode, interviewer Sean as always and Conan was a good guest for some wing action. Thanks!
There was talk of gerbils
Dude was on demon time throughout the show
SEAN PLS GET ON CONAN NEEDS A FRIEND PLS 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Conan rocks!
This inspired me to live less stressed. Wow! Hilarious and unreal!
Conan is one of thee greatest all around humans/entertainers to ever walk the earth. This was so long overdue, thank you hot ones
Conan is the master and Doctor Arroyo seems to be one  of the (fellow) good hombre. I know because I am too 😇
Okay, this really just embodies Conan I'm pretty sure he won the game.
We’re all in agreement that this is the most unhinged hot ones episode ever right?
Love Conan but what a handful! Sean - you ARE a great interviewer; great prep & questions!
I wish this will viral. Love Conan
He has the same day as my daughter’s birthday, and my birthday is the day after awesome
61 year old irishman man chugging DA BOMB and not skipping a single beat. UNREAL, I was geeking out.
Comedian Christmas  Thank you..  Conan
Conan is one of the absolute best human beings in the entire world. Sean, you're not too bad yourself! What an absolute legend of a performer O'Brien is.
I love how Conan can make Sean laugh 😂
If hot ones was a competition then Conan has just won and no one is beating that.
CONAN IS GOD
The extra DaBomb. Bless this man lol.
The host tries so hard to ask these deep questions but just comes across as a faux-intellectual.
He needs a long day in the summer sun.
Max sounds like Cinemax
MOST EPIC !!!HOT ONES EPISODE!!!
This interview was completely unhinged but I absolutely loved it 😂😂
Why was this so chaotic
Conan is the GOAT!! "Why can't I feel?" Poor Guy... LOLZ
glad conan and the buffalo finally squashed the beef
Top notch episode, this one cannot be topped. Conan cursing more and more by the end is so unintentionally hilarious. This entire episode was everything we needed and more, perfection!
I'm Team Coco. I loved his San Diego Comic Con show. Effen hilarious! I miss him having a talk show.
BEST ONE EVER!!!!
April 18 is also my late husband's birthday.  He was also a red-head with an Irish background.  LOL
All hail Conan! 🐐
good lord
It’s funny but I’m also concerned 😅
Need to get Jordan shlanski (spelling?) on next since you did conan. It's only right. Conan and Jordan as a pair would be amazing
i almsot puked when hes spitting chunks out🤢
Love Conan, but as someone who CLEANS each wing and leaves no meat on it, he's just taking the smallest bite out of all of these and not finishing and it's driving me nuts.
Sometimes I wonder why Conan is my celebrity crush..
CRYING !!!!! Legitimately tearing up at the ending! 😂😅😭
this is the hardest ive genuinely laughed at a youtube video in years
THAT'S gonna be hard to top. conan the goat
What a GOAT! 🐐
Praying for Conan right now not going to lie.
HEY, LOOK AT US! WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT?
brilliant ⭐️
Chaos…pure chaos…I love it lol
Conan has some serious pain endurance.  Amazing! So funny!
Da bomb beyond insanity. More like Conan O'Brien beyond INSANE!.
"I run a little cool" Yes you do Conan 😎
I could not stop laughing!Best episode yet! Thank you Hot One’s!
CONAN WAS MY FAVORITE INTERVIEW!
And that cements why I love Conan hahaha
Thank you for the show! I know this is the last one because after the inevitable death of your season finale guest from hot sauce overload will get this show shut down.
Only half way through this episode. And I love it. Conan is my idol that’s for sure.
Legendary episode!  I went in hoping it would be funny and Conan crushed it.
Been waiting for this one 😢❤ im so  happy
top 5 all time, easy
Doctor check my pulse… “it’s there”🤣
What a legend
I always thought Conan O'Brien would make a great president.
He's going to be so messed up 😮
Oh boy. The pastiest meets the tastiest.
conan not tapping but instead going crazy on the sauce unlike any other guest is one of the more shocking things i never saw coming
This has to be the single most crazy Hot Ones EVER. I was crying I was laughing so hard. 😂
Dr. Royal got Pointcrow vibes
Epic AF🔥💯
Suffering through a mediocre season full of unwatchable guests. It was all worth it for this!!!
What a great finale, one of the best guests!
I think Conan is going to pick up a few four legged fans on his way home.
Favorite interview ever.
I thought you said you were closing out the season with Shakira
I’m giving it a light before I even watch it
I think, because he is 100% irish. Their pale skin absorbs the heat of the spices like a Nasa space tile.
LADIES AND GENTELMAN: THE LEGEND ❤
And to think that crazy funny man attended Harvard - and now this...hilarious 😅
16:57 Is this Lewis Black? 😂
This one is my all time favorite!!!!!!!! Wow oh wow 🤩 can’t believe how he handled the hotness 😂😂😂😂
I love conan!! 😂
If there was an audience I'd imagine them chanting "RUB YOUR EYES!"
He’s just not funny anymore.
Immediately upon starting to watch this for the second time, I realized how much Conan was considering this as a personal challenge from the entire internet, being super defensive and declaring how ready he was to prove himself against "the wings of death." Then, he took it to the extreme and never once got out of character.  I always liked watching Conan, since he first started doing "Late Night", but haven't realized how great of a comedian he is until now.
😂😂 definitely one of my all-time favorite Hot Ones ❤️
The man is so Irish, he has no taste buds. Those sauces are fckin hot.   Best guest, best guest of the season.  Beyond expectations. Way to be a savage Conan.
I don't have the words to describe what I just witness, except for Comedy Gold, and Genius comes to mind
The big red dog takes over the script...
No way Conan didn't take capsazepine
🫡Respect and subscribing to Max to watch his new show.
This whole interview is pure Conan: 100% absurdity with 1000% commitment
Exact Conan experience i would expect. lol. Great stuff.
Conan O'Brien is a shark jumping over itself, an ouroboroshark.  That was a true spectacle!
Conan is the best
Top 5 ever IMO
Conan is the man.
Conan brought along a European doctor. Just from Europe.
Conan was amazing on this show
THE GOAT HAS APPEARED!!!!!!!
TREMENDOUS!
Conan went barbarian on a toilet soon after this episode.   All jokes aside, Conan O'Brien has been the man, practically my whole life. lol Long live the king
this was one of my fav episodes, cranston handled it better in a diff way, and shia set the bar higher!!!!!!!!!!!
"He's not the best...but he's very affordable." LOL
Conan is a straight LEGEND!
"I bet you live 4 more years tops" would have been the best closing line from the Doc at the end.
I think you may have just made the best episode of this show that will ever exist.
Conan! The King o Hot Wings! :) Wing Drop!
The greatest episode ever. It is not a close race.
stop painting your face
The way Conan's hair keeps perfect throughout the whole show.
This might be the best episode of Hot Ones.
O’Brien is a Legend and especially for this l.
I just died from PEAK
YESSSSSSSSS
Man...this episode goes straight into the Hall of Fame.
He gonna wish he had doctor in the morning after
Noone will even top this Hot Ones episode.
Conan is literally a national treasure
BEST EPISODE EVER BAR NONE
I give Conan o’brien 4 years 😏
I’m crying….😂😂😂 He’s utterly unhinged
Get Tim Robinson
Dear Lord that did not go where I thought it was going to 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
Man. What a legend. I loved Conan before, but I love him so much more now. This was a perfect season finale.
Funniest episode EVER!!! CONAN IS THE GOAT OF HOT ONES!!!!
Conan is a comedy genius. What a legend. Loved the interview.   Arroyo is a legend as well.
That's was the best episode ever!!!!
YESSS
Icon!
He survive Da Bomb like it was nothing. Incredible
This man lives and breathes comedy. Every single word or action he does is for the sake of making you laugh. Truly a master of his craft.
Best episode ever this guys rocks lol
Had to do the Nixon. Lol
Gordon Ramsay & Conan O'Brian. Battle for #1🤔
Is Conan still alive?
This is the greatest thing I’ve ever seen.
wow I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. that's how you f***in' do it
Conan is the epitome of ADHD
That guy might be the biggest entertainer eve...he's just funny 😂
🤯🤯🤯
I knew this was going to be great Conan and Craig Ferguson were always the 2 best Late Night hosts by a mile, and Conan as always was hilarious here, epic season finale 👏.
Conan on coke 😆
Hands down the very best episode ever, Conan is a beast !
Nooooooo!!! Conan brought Jose arroyo??? Nice to see him❤
That was one of the most insane, and funny moments from Conan ever!  He is on another level!  Hilarious!
The guest I've been hoping the most for, for years! Conan is a legend, and he just killed it, way to up the anti!
"What's wrong with me! Why can't I feel"  Conan O'Brien
The best episode ever made 😂
I absolutely loved this one
Conan is the devil.
Te amo Conando
That's possibly the best hot ones I have ever seen. 👏
“Oh it’s building”  “Yeah, and it’s kinda not gonna stop” 😂 This is the best one I’ve seen! Conan is the man.
Shakira (God love her) was boring.  I truly did not know how much I've missed Conan.  Imo best hot ones. So far!
This is the day I have been waiting for…
That's a wrap, no one is going to top this episode.
best one so far
Lol. Only AI Conan could be that good with DaBomb. Amazing and hilarious. Best final episode ever.
Great job Conan!
You need to invite Jordan Schlansky to the show!
This is the best episode,  Conan, well done!
Ive been a C O'B fan for so many years. He was correct about Sean's interview skills. Sean could be on CNN if he wanted.
Best guest ever!!
how is conan killing the hot sauce lol
Conan just dominated that gauntlet 😂😂😂😂
i love coco so much lol
I love how Conan put his wings away to make sure they don’t clone him but made it seem like a bit! Legend!
Yea Conan!  But while I love your cockiness, you didn't finish the wing :(  Also, while the host of this show is fantastic, i doubt he writes his own questions.  Best guest yet!
Definition of "committing to the bit" 😂
The best there was, the best there is and the best there ever will be! Thank you Conan!
20:28.   Funny, cause I know it as Conan's "noise". It's his thing. He got it from tha stooges, I got it from him, who knows who inspired tha stooges & who knows who I'll inspire 🙌🏿  I love Conan O'Brien with all my heart!!
That doc tho 😂
Conan is like --now top that!
Legendary.
I think you should have him go left to right next time u have him on
Well, how do you ever watch any other episode after that. Nothing will compare.
Favourite episode ever
This episode is one for the hall of fame. Grew up watching Conan and he absolutely reignited all the same energy and quips he's always had, dude is still on his beat.
Dr. Arricho is not the doctor I need, but the one I can afford.
This is the first time in my life when I hit the like button the very first second the video started.
This was the best one yet😂
This was incredible, thank you Conan and Hot Ones!
Definitely most impressive performance of any episode.  That won't ever be topped.
I believe this is the first ever confirmed case of rabies contracted from hot sauce.  Was Dr. Arroyo Max Weinberg?
He’s such a legend
I clicked on this instantly
BEST EPISODE EVER!
Best late night host in history! Never sold out
Man lol, Conana is crazy!^^ Caint believe he showed up, Sean had NO IDEA what he was in for lol!!^^ \O> Wait a minute, HBO and MAx? Max as in, Cinemax? Remember when the hot pay channels were HBO Showtime and Cinemax? Are thoise still a thing? I been in Europe for years now and don't watch tv so...
I don't think I've ever seen Sean have as much fun as he did with Conan.
This is comedic genius at it's best.
Absolutely unhinged and delivered as expected lol
22:36 is the most disturbed I have ever seen him look 😂
Goat.
Best Hot Ones ever 🔥🔥🔥
Wow I guess it’s time to remove da bomb, it got ridiculed by Conan, best episode ever!
Conan never disappoints
HAHAHAHAHAHA
It's there 😂😂😂
I told my girlfriend about a week ago Hot Ones was going to have a really good guest on for the season finale, and imo the best person they could get would be Conan O’Brien.  This feels like a dream!  Not only did he come on, but he made the most entertaining episode of all time AND performed the best against the wings 🤯
He’s like a 60 year old toddler!
Can I just say, "Sean, you are a legend". I can't begin to imagine what it was like trying to match that madman, spice for spice, dab for dab. "Chapeau".
Noone in the history of this show in its many years, have taken done wings like CoCo... Legendary 👏 👏
Truly effin AMAZING! Hands down the greatest guest! Better than all the guests.
Love him
I have seen most episodes since the start of Hot Ones and I have to say it’s been one of the most entertaining. Couldn’t stop laughing! ❤
Christ 😂😂
Truly epic!  I don’t think he can be beaten, he murdered those wings.
This is just pure JOY entertainment from the absolutely fantastic entertainer Conan O'Brien!! One of the best episodes of Hot Ones!!
He is more wild than Steve-o
I love Coco so much
how are they gonna top this ...
🤣😂🤣😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Conan is a LEGEND!!!!
Conan is my Carson.
I expect no less true comedic genius as always than from Conan, the best of the best!
Brilliant 😂😂😂😂😂
Conan is king.
23 seasons culminated in this episode
Haven’t been back to hot ones in a while but this one will definitely be worth it
This is one of my favorite interviews of all time
I’ve been watching Hot Ones for many years now, but I don’t think I’ve ever heard Sean say” Oh My Gawd!!!” so many times and with such feeling ever before!  Nice jacket, Sean!
Love to see that perfectly normal guy Conan eating hot wings.  Would watch again.
"What's wrong with me? Why can't I feel? " 😂 too funny
I’m so bad at spice. Bathes in spice.
The best Hot Ones. Ever.
Idk if I ever enjoyed an episode as much as this.  Conan is goated
This was one of the best ones yet. Maybe my favourite! What a guy, that Conan 😂
Conans a mad man 🤣
Conan is a legend. Love him so, so much.
Not human.
Legend!
Finally, someone I actually know who they are. If I don't know who the h*ll the guest is, I don't even watch.... which has been most lately.
Conan is the best
Wow. Remarkable interview, remarkable performance. Fun fun fun 😂😂😂 what a great episode ❤
This. This is the best.❤️
It must be sad for Sean knowing he will never make a better episode than this one
There will never be another Conan! Dude is irreplaceable, This will go down as the best episode hot one’s ever shot!
God….if Conan was still an SNL writer I just KNOW he’d write a sketch about “pocket wings”.
I love this man more than life
first we feast shadow banned me because I called them out for only bring leftists on their show. How leftist of them.
Love that Conan acts insane throughout but still answers every question earnestly.
By faaarrrrrrr the best episode of Hot Ones.
The best episode ever. Hands down.
Conan went on someone else's show and had a Grade A reoccurring bit.
BEST.EPISODE.EVER.
That man is pure chaos.
The doctor had some great improv.
"Conan. Beyond insanity".
Craziest Hot Ones episode I’ve ever seen
Wow, that escalated
Has to be an Emmy winner there
This is the funniest episode thus far. I am crying laughing, peak comedy.
Is Conan's new show like Ricky Gervais's show "An Idiot Abroad" ?
I'm writing from a few days after this first aired to report that Conan did not die immediately following this performance.  Some how.
BEST Hot Ones guest of all time, hands down!
Have you ever wondered what the opposite of DJ Khaled is?
The only way I could do that was if you wanted me too I could come and pick it out and then I can go pick up it from your place or you could just pick me out of there or you could pick me out from the store or you can just come pick me out or you could go to my house or you can pick me out if that’s what you’re going with your house and I could just go pick you out and take care and then I could just pick it out up from wherever
No wonder why he is the best talkshow host!
Pure Chaos
I’ve never clicked on something so fast with Conan in it
Man i wish my friend was still around to watch this. He would have loved it.
YES!!!!!!!!!!
Conan is the best. Somebody really should give him his own talk show.
Conan screaming at Sean through the pain was great
I knew the second I saw Conan was on the show this was going to be legendary. And it only leaves one question. Where do we go from here?! No one can top this! Greatest late night interviewer of all time! Greatest comedian of all time! Now the greatest wing eater of all time! Forever a legend!
god this had to be the funniest hot ones ever
"My pocket is getting full"😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
Amazing
Conan....i will subscribe to MAX and watch you show. Amen 😮
Most chaotic show ever.   Congratulations!
The MAN!
You finally did it! I love Conan! He was and is my favourite talk show host and he’s brilliantly funny! Howard Stern is on record saying Conan was his favourite interview guest ever! Thanks Hot Ones! 🔥 🔥 🔥
I'm in my first trimester of pregnancy and gagged my way through this but I couldn't look away
I want Jordan Schlansky on the show.
Conan displaying why he is one of the best to ever do it🤣🤣
And on that day, Conan saw second to what Groucho Marx saw. Pure comedy that cares and doesn't care. The phantom line is smart and funny.
How long was he in the hospital after this? 🤣🤣🤣
Conan! What a king! And giving Sean the props (he deserves btw) is just awesome. Straight up respect!
I need to make an appointment with Dr. Arroyo
Thank you
I love Saun but this epiode is a testament to how great Conan is and there is nobody like him. Best episode ever
That was the most masculine thing I've ever seen.
CONAN KILLED BEA ARTHUR
This was the best episode so far. Ramsay held number 1 until now. Conan is the best !!!
I've missed Conan. He has no barriers
Premature Last Dab for the win!
Conan still got that big D energy. A true party animal.
Best guest yet.. I love Conan!!!
I closed my bible so fast!!!
Guy is a lost in his own mind
I'll have to rewatch this episode in a couple of days to be absolutely sure, but right now I think this has been my favorite one.  Conan is a beast!
I absolutely love this episode.
Dope episode.
Best one yet perfect way to end the season
Total commitment. This is Conan's brand.
I laughed til it hurt...EPIC
Imagine if Jordan was on this episode too !!!
THE best episode. Ever
He looks like a crazed joker
Finally
that’s a professional!
Great season finale 😂😂😂
What is wrong with him
Conan O'Brien always THE BEST!!!
Hands down the top episode !! As conan said wing 🍗 drop !!!
Awesome Interview! Great Chemistry!
he won this game.
LEGENDARY
Jesus..... homeboy went hard af.
This is definitely my favorite hot ones episode! Hands-down… The greatest episode of this show!
Best episode hands down. Conan is freaking hysterical and brilliant. Sean when he laughs is the best!
That’s one of the best episodes up there with Dave Grohl and Gordon Ramsay
Treating Da Bomb with such flippancy is a great heel move.
Best episode, conan seems to be a toddler 😅😅😅
This was perfection.
"what's wrong with me why can't I feel?!" hahhaha
Outstanding. Thanks
Sitting here in tears and sides hurting.. this is why Conan is the best😂😂😭
My new favorite episode!!😂
I hate when the do a bit for the while thing.
Best episode ever
Legendary! 😂
THIS WAS SO FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!❤❤❤
The best episode of all time.
I’d like updates about Conan on the hour every hour … :proceeds to 3rd rewatch:
STAMP IT THE GOAT
How can you top this? Amazing episode.
One of the greatest ever. Conan is amazing. I love listening to his podcast. And his remotes are amazing. I’m glad he’s doing this new show. So funny. So smart. So kind
THANK YOU HOT ONES THANK YOU SEAN!
He wrote on the simpsons, you sure he didn't drink a candle before this? lol
INSTANT CLASSIC
Conan completely dismantled Sean
Conan is officially the hot ones GOAT
This is my favorite episode by far!
A masterclass. Absolute art.
Incedible!! Best one ever for sure
When will the show get back to a single table?
I never thought I’d see a better Hot Ones guest than Gordon Ramsay, but Conan just took home the trophy 👏👏👏
8:10 this is why I don’t like how Colbert interviews guests like that. If Colbert is bored it’ll show, if the guest doesn’t hit a punchline, make a point, do something awkward, he’ll just let it sit in empty space and move on
Newfound respect for Conan
I can't even begin to consolidate the words to express Conan's excellence here. He's just a legend. Plain, simple, true.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Absolutely hilarious
We love you Conan!
Conan's a god of improv
By far the best guest in my eyes. Conan is amazing!
Conan is rowdy AF 😂 that was an awesome episode!
I love hearing people cuss, that don't usually cuss. 😊
ohh my god!.. that is absolutly insane....
😂 Sean got Conans back  Where?  Where?!
This had season one energy at absolutely ridiculous levels, top 3 episode ever
"the other guy... I dont know what he does lol" Jay Leno right there
❤❤❤🎉
Oh man
Conan the legend .
Conan is the man!😂
absolutely herculean from conan. channeled robin williams for moments there, just unbelievably good
Was half expecting Schlansky to show up as his doctor 😂😂😂
the Dr Arroyo bit was genius
I love CONAN  ❤❤❤❤❤
Conan is the funniest man alive, and I won't be told otherwise.
Where is jordan schlansky😮
Conan is such a pleasure to watch. I've always preferred him over that other guy. 🥰
The bar has been raised. Good luck topping that. Conan is a true legend. I really enjoyed this episode. What a showman. Amazing. I have tried "Da bomb beyond insanity", and doing it with a straight face like that.... Wow.
Conan may have just cemented himself as the GOAT hot ones interview. The fact that he made a speech about finding comedy in everything and that anything can be funny having just drank the hottest sauce imaginable and smear hot sauce all over his face and bring in a fake doctor is just pure comedy
Conan is the best late night host and it shouldn't even be a question by now. No disrespect to the others he's just on another level.
Hot Ones broke Conan!😮
DUDE!  You're interviewing Conan!  BOOM!
Incredible episode! Truly entertaining, both in comedy and in the questions!
disrespected the show
Hahahahaha
National treasure
Just think about how he is gonna feel next time he’s going to the toilet😂
Bro.  Conan is a beast.
That Legendary hair.... thanks Sean!
This episode rivals gordan ramsay
Conan O Brien looks like an Elder Scrolls:Oblivion Vampire
I mean.. top 3 all time Hot Ones. Easy.
What a showman. One of the best episodes I’ve seen.
Yesss!!!!
This truly is an era defining episode
❤❤❤
23:50 that shot is priceless 😄
"Da Bomb has left the room..."
This is peak
I’ve never clicked on a video so fast!!
All of these ive watched and this is the best one BY FAR! Love Conan
This is my favorite 😂
this episode was like riding a earth dragon as a sky person. And they want to show you their home.
By far the greatest of all time guest you’ve had on Hot Wings!!! ❤️🌶
Fav episode
Legend
Conan is great, but I did not expect such a performance from him! This was great!
HAHAHA
Incredible. Best guest ever.
Conan last dabbed da-bomb.  Is there is a higher level than GOAT!? Is Conan a god? Is he the second coming and we have all just been lost all this time? His stomach lining is dying for our sins.
Funny how Conan always says he's not cool, man I wish I was as uncool as him!!!
I don't even know what to say this man's insane
About flip floppity time for this one. ❤
Conan is one of the funniest people ever to walk this Earth.
Why did they show the pic of David Arquette showing his calf??
This is my favourite episode ever
What is wrong with me, why can I feel?
Top form lol
Best episode yet! Conan is an absolute LEGEND!
INCREDIBLE
Dr Arroyo for the win 😅😂
I think this is my favorite hot ones interview now.
Conan just demolished Hot Ones. Good luck to any guest following him.
Conan shows great control of "mind over matter" here. Completely professional performer.
I AM CRYING 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 .The man is a hero and a psychopath. TEAM COCO!!!!!!🔥
Everyone is a gangsta till they get #8, lol.
Conan is the best!!!!!
Next Conan show is gonna be from the hospital i guess lol
OMFG!!! Best show yet 🤣🤣😝
CoNan🤗🤗
"I don't fear your wings, man" 😅 Great opener!
Conan is just a pure, unadulterated entertainer. This was probably the most entertaining interview they’ve ever had.
When I watch Conan like this, it reminds me how much funnier, more interesting, and more talented he is than other late night hosts. Especially, Jay Leno and Jimmy Fallon.
The BEST episode by far!
Conan a real G
That was one of the best Hot Ones I've seen....
The GOAT!!!!!!!!!!
Great season ending 🎉🎉🎉
Charlie Rose with hot wings
If you don't understand Conan O' Brien's style, then you just don't get class and wit. I admire this man a lot. He is one of the last GREAT comedians. And not just that, but he's a genuinely incredible conversationalist.
Best episode ever. Love The Conan.
He is one tuff MF
Ever since I was a kid I loved Conan and his comedy, the chicken wings in the pocket killed me every time 😂😂
Gonna be hard to top this one. Just saying.
Jay Leno would never do this, he’s too busy in his garage
Haven't watched Hot Ones ina while, but when i saw Conan i clicked instantly
Power over spice is power over all
Sean lied to Shakira?  He told her that she was the last one on Season 23.
Wow I haven't laughed till I cried in a long time. Amazing interview from top to bottom.
This has to be the most chaotic yet top of the line interview ever …
Moronic Chaos, and I was there for every moment of it. Conan = GOAT!
Always liked Conan. Think/hope he’s one of the good guys?  Nice that he acknowledged how good Sean’s interviewing technique is. Two pros 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I didn't know Conan was an absolute maniac! LOL
This was on my top 10!  Andrew W.K. is #1, and I will keep on requesting...
CONAN IS A SAVAGE !!! A BEAST !!!! ... WING DROP !!!
This video dropped 8 hours ago and still hasn't had a million views! Smh! Conan was great!
It's like conan snorted a bucket of coke and went nuts
Conan and Sean just a great combo! More with Conan in the future if possible.
Why is Conan's comedy more manufactured then the phone I'm watching this on right now?
Conan is the man! Best episode so far.
Until this moment I didn’t like Conan. I have changed my mind
Conan is spitting truth and a loooot of other fluids. This is the definition of chaotic good
Is Conan going to throw-out that jacket?
I honestly don't see how this episode can ever be topped.
Coney. BEST. GUEST. EVER. 🥵🥵🥵🥵👏👏👏👏
Never have i clicked a video so fast
Conan's poops going to melt the toilet.
This was madness and amazing
Never thought anyone would top Ramsay, but Conan...you did it!
That makes up for the Ice Spice interview.
This is cinema.
What an legend, we all know he was hurting, but laugh is a laugh. And he know how to get it. Best ever guest by far.
Wow you got Conan. That's huge
Conan ive watched you on late night since i was a kid im 26 now but i was at every single show for your last season. Youre one of the greats. Never stop being you man
This one hits different 😂
I am not a guy that really likes celebrities but if I ever saw Conan on the street I would be starstruck. He is absolutely hilarious, and his employees adore him. The mark of a truly good person.   There was talk of gerbils.
amazing! its like this is naturally the final episode of hot ones. 😅
Greatest. Episode. Ever.
The GOAT of all Hit Ones episodes
"Thats MY man." Liza, probably.
Brother this man's face is doused in hot sauce and people are still trying to toss shade like "oh but he looks a little red in the face" Edit: My gods he drank straight from the bottle.
This was amazing!!!
Absolutely incredible!!
love all this Conan stuff popping up on my feed
Jesus christ move over David Blaine!
easily the best guest this show has ever had
"Dr Arroyo, check my pulse" "It's there" 🤣🤣😂😂
Conan, is awesome. What a commitment to be brave. This was the best episode yet. O'Brien should win another Emmy Award for this one.
I owe you an apology Conan. I wans't really familiar with your game.
This is the best episode ever.
Man, i just love Conan
That was beautiful swade
he is literally such a treasure and i feel like he is underrated. i think he's finally starting to get his flowers that he has always deserved!
I feel like I'm seeing Robert Redford turning into the joker
Conan O'Brien is the king 🤴 all hail!!
Best Hot Ones ever... period!!
BEST . . . HOT ONES . . . EVER!
Best Hot Ones Ever!!! 😂😂😂
That was legendary.
Bravo!
Conan is the best.  Nev'r'l'b another like him.
Most insane episode ever. Conan is a GOD.
What a legend
Genius
conan is wayyyyyyy toooo funnnnyyyyy
Conan is the Lisan Al Gaib! LET THE SPICE FLOW!!
Jesus Christ, I knew that it will be funny and sincere, but I did not expect this level of madness and honesty. Thank you, Conan. Thank you, Sean.
what a monster
I’m pretty sure you just interviewed a vampire
Am i the only one here to see Conan compliment Sean's skill at interviewing? it became a tradition.
That's the doctor that asked John Mulaney to take his shirt off.
INCREDIBLE
Can't stop laughing! 😂
This is what I've been waiting for
😂😂😂😂
I hope Pusha T watches this. LOL.
😂😂😂😂❤
what a Legend....
I don't know why I didn't want to watch this.... but somehow is the best episode of all time 😂😂😂❤
Didnt he tell shakira she was the last of season
This was iconic
"that's right! My intestines have turned into acid and I can still remember the plug! that's a professional" 🤌
Its oficial Conan is tougher than DJ khaled
The best guest ....so crazy 😂😂
LEGEND!!!!!!
some say Conan put Wax in his mouth before starting the hot wings challenge
Poor Sean. "Why can't I feel?"
Legendary
Conan bringing his own bit to someone else's show is so on brand.
That....... Was..... Intense  😳
We are watching what greatness is all about
I’ll have what he’s having lol what an animal
Best episode ever😂😂😂😂
I love you and I miss you Conan! Come back to TV!
Conan O'Brien is the best.
Proof positive that no one, and I mean NO ONE, tilts at windmills harder than CONAN O'BRIEN!
GOAT !!!!!!!
Bro Conan is fuckomg hilarious 😂😂😂 he's gonna be in PAIN though
Conan  has been the ultimate wing worrier nobody has done what he just did he did dabs on the last 4 wings, I don’t think anybody will top that 🙌
he drank from the bottle, easily one of the best guests ever
One like button is not enough
Thats a man who has had a lot of sloppy jalepenjoes.....
Instant classic.
Protect Conan at all costs.
This was the most unhinged Hot Ones episode 😂😂😂
That was the best episode of hot ones by far
That's what pure commitment to comedy looks like.
Conan is just the best
Conan is INSANE!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can't understand how he pulled that off. He should be in intense pain.
HE CRUSHED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Glad to see that theres a huge conan fanbase in the comments. love you conan!!!
Conan brought back the excitement of the "old" days of Hot Ones.
"You cannot stop me from being me" - truly a great line in a great episode
He must have waxed his mouth just like Homer Simpson!
Dude these guys have the same resting interview face
This has to be the funniest hot. One show that I have Evan sees since season 1. Conan was great. I'm glad that he close this season with you guys. Needs to come back
this is art
He kicked it
Man you don't bring Conan into your show to interview him, you give him the keys and let him work.
Absolute maniac.
Presented by Travel Texas? Gross.
Conan was great… but I don’t want to see guest doing bits.
I didn't expect anything less from Conan.
Lol hahaha Conan level bb!!  Yes.
I clicked like before I even watched! I love Conan! I know this hot ones episode will be gold!
Man they got one of the biggest talk show liars whoopie
This is the best ever performance. Handsdown number one.
Conan O' BRIII-EN!!!
this is it, he is the moment
I’ve never been so scared for Sean… until this episode 😂😳🥵🥵🥵
Best episode ever I cannot believe he did that with the bomb
lisan al gaib!
Conan is a g 😂
Pure. Comedy. Gold.
I love this man
I’m dying that I was so funny
800k views in 7 hours. The combined power of Conan and Hot Ones.
The Clueless Gamer himself...
I dont think no other person on earth can top what Conan did on this show. Not before not in the future. Drop them sunglasses on Conan's face please!!!
That was so fun to watch.
<3
incredible
Conan is the man! Also, he is a madman.
Conan putting on a masterclass here
My gosh was Sean in the passenger seat for the ride Conan took him on
Sean.....give this guy a crown.  He wins it.  Not even Stone Cold did so much sauce.
Come to Indonesian and you will know what is hot and spicy...
Absolute legend!
La mejor que he visto de putisima madre jajajaajjaajjajajajjajajajjajaja!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥
The pure and sheer chaos of this video is the most Conan thing ever.
This feels like the episode of the Simpsons where Homer drinks candle wax so he can eat 5 alarm chili. Missed opportunity, O'Brien!
EPIC!
You don’t have to fight to stay relevant to the kids, Conan. You’re the king for a reason.
Conan is the best, no competition. Goated.
Best episode ever
I think this is the best/ one of the best episodes. I love Conan. Incredible.
Almost a million views after just 7 hours… Wow!
I don't care what all ya'll say negatively about this episode,,,but this is the BEST episode ever😂😂😂😂
Brilliant!!
Can already tell before watching this is going to be gold
This episode should break the record and the internet
Not even two minutes in and Conan has me laughing. He was the funniest talk show host. Miss him and his show
"WHAT'S THE POINT OF EVEN BEING ALIVE!"  "ok that one"  😂😂😂
sean this might have to be the series finale as nothing is better
21:12 was some Ben stiller trying not to eat donuts and pizza but gets electrocuted when he does😂
crazy move on da bomb.
Hands down the best episode 😅
Eww this made me wanna throw up. Disgusting.
Best. Guest. Ever. Nobody has or will top this.
Thumbnail pretty much sums up who conan is 😂😂😂
I think this is my favorite so far. Definitely the most hilarious episode.
Gingers have a high pain tolerance!
Make conan the new host. Now. Do it. I dare you.
One word....ANIMAL!!  Mr O'Brien put himself through so much to "stay" funny.  This guy has been hilarious for decades, he should feel no need to stay funny just for kicks.  Conan, you do not need to impress anyone, you are amazing just be you!!
This is the best one yet lol
Favorite episode 😂
What a hoot!  He has no taste buds! Crazy!
This is the turning point for old Coney
Fckn hysterical!!  I've loved me some Coco since the SNL days!!
Best Hot Ones ever
I never finish an entire hot ones episode, or I usually skim through, it, but there was nothing to skip with this Conan o’briens interview!! He made me laugh so much, there was nothing to skip!! I like how he also made Sean and the behind the scenes members laugh as well. When you hear distant laughing from the crew, that’s how you know you’re actually funny
when did buzzfeed buy first we feast?
best hot ones of all time
I hope Dj Khaled sees this 😂
Nailed it…Legend!
wow this has to be the greatest one
Conan getting high on capsaicin. Didn't know how good it could be
Conan, you absolute manic legend! That was commitment to the bit at its finest. The gradual descent into chaos was hilarious. The stuffed and open jacket, bare chested wet with drool and milk, face painted with hot sauce.   This was absolute gold. Thanks for the laugh Conan 😂
Conan just made himself look like a fool. I didn't even watch the whole episode. He tried to take over and nah... F that
Conan!
Love you Conan!  Id love to see Conan's aftermath interview a few days later.
The goat 🐐  miss watching him on the show
Hall of Fame Episode
Best episode yet
Best episode ever.  EASILY!
Shoulda been 20 wings.😊
That was absolutely great! I was worried for a moment Conan would dump hot sauce in his like Steve O
Conan is like Hot Ones Boss Fight Impossible level, each attack just get him HP recovered and berserk 👹
Absolute gold.
Conan just WON Hot Ones!  All the Hot Ones!!!
24:56 take note, THAT's a real comedy pro
Best episode ever
WOW
Conan is your favorite late night hosts favorite late night host
Connan took it to a new level, I don't know if I've been more impressed with someone crushing the wings of death. Respect.
How to deplete an introvert of all their energy for life in under 30 mins 😂
"Where did you go to school." "Ah...out of state."
conan is the greatest ever
this has to be one of the best interview of all the history
I love Conan so much
Conan is THE MAN, definitely the best guest to be on the show so far. Amazing.
Best episode yet! Conan is a genius
Conan is just one of the greatest entertainers of all time.
Thank goodness the Irish invented Whiskey because if they had invented hot sauce... well... you see what happened to Conan.
by far the funniest hot ones ive seen.
I've loved a few of the episodes of hot ones but I was cackling at times watching this one with Conan. My love for this man's comedy goes back to his late night show and I obviously have a bias but this episode was so terribly entertaining to watch 😂
This sets the bar super high. I love Conan.
Best guest ever😂😂😂😭😭😭😂😭
Holy 💩
This has turned my mood around for the week. This is the most unhinged I’ve seen Conan EVER.
Not a huge fan of Conan, but this was incredible! Great job Conan and Sean!
LOL off the rails Conan, (ok guys, skip the questions)🌶🌶🤣🤣  It's ok to chuck your cookies Conan
Probably the best episode yet. Up there with Ramsay!
This is genuinely the best episode of hot ones ever
The rumor of Conan's fear of someone stilling his DNA and cloning him is true. Hid all the bitten chicken
Epic!!!!  I loved ever second of this!
23:00
CONAN IS THE GOAT!!!
Best. Episode. Ever.
That's a game guy!
I love the fact that even though he goes crazy with the bit, he still takes the time to answer all of the questions respectfully and takes them seriously.
I think this the first time Sean was taken aback by a compliment from his guest
Imagine your sponsor being the ad before the video dang
I laughed more at this than any other episode by about a million
This is the episode I expected from Johnny Knoxville, not Conan O'Brien
I SO badly want to hear Conan talk about how he felt after this 😂
Conan broke the internet with this one. Legend
WE NEED THE WATER BUFFALO FOOTAGE
didnt think one could out heat Paul Rudd's episode and would've never thought Conan. Beast!
The last 5 minutes could have come right out of Sorkin's News Room
i love conan obrien
Conan is awesome.   What a great episode.
Conan is one of those few celebrities who were with me since forever. I remember being an elementary school kid in the mid-nineties, watching his weird early shows (still the wildest ones he did in my eyes) on sleepovers with my best friend. Afterwards I found out he wrote my two favourite Simpsons episodes, I watched him all through the 2000s as a college kid, saw him get completely disrespected by NBC and then started downloading his cable show in the 2010s whenever I could find it – his Bill Burr and Norm McDonald interviews were some of the best talk show moments of all time. I’m a forty year old man now, and I’m so glad he’s still going strong in his sixties, spending his time just doing the things he loves. He’s basically doing side missions now because he completed the main quest. Absolute legend, responsible for half of my sense of humour. Fantastic interview as well this.
I yam what I am.  Priceless!
We gingers have no soul, therefore we feel no pain.
best of alll
Redheads are less sensitive to skin pain and can handle very spicy food. Conan is clearing proving the science is correct.
Absolute LEGEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Best guest EVER!!!!!!!!
🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
This completely makes up for the disappointment of ice spice as a guest
This is by far the most legendary episode in Hot Ones history.
This might be my favorite episode of Hot Ones. Conan is a madman
This may be the best reaction to the wings since Eric Andre. At last, we have a successor.
epic, Conan. epic.
Wow, that was a good one! Nice job Conan.
the absolute GOAT. production both pick the best guest and also now they gotta raise the bar. good luck guys.
THE BEST!
he took over the show, turned it upside down on its head, nobody knew what was going on or what was coming next. Sean had gone soft and he blew him out the water, season one Seun would have rode with him right into the fiery horizon. "Its the season finally, isn't??"
I could watch Conan all day long.
I like how there was no hesitation saying Nixon
Maybe a nice voice over for camera guy Bill? 😇
Conan washing his hands in hot sauce was the pinnacle of this interview.
Conan came and conquered. Nobody does it better than Conan
This is probably the best interview of hots ones ever done.
He will never wear that jacket again.
He forgot his medications
great!!! the forst i really enjoy!!!!
THAT HAS TO BE ONE OF THE CRAZIEST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN..........hilarious!
This is one of the best.   In the Paul Rudd tier.
I love Conan so much 😂❤
Here from X
Conan proves that he is the greatest interviewer in showbiz once again. Bringing his own side characters and punching up the comedy of the interview right out of the gate. Straight up best episode of hot ones ever.
1:41 - Gold.
Ok there is no debate now, he handled the hot sauces better than any guest of all time. Was NOT expecting that.   Best episode ever.
Conan’s half eaten wings from Hot Ones are already on eBay for 8K USD 😂
This was absolutely beautiful
Greatest guest on the show to date, and I’ve never even seen a Conan show before.
I think this is easily the most fun I've had watching this show 😂 😂  Conan getting exponentionally unhinged was hilarious.
😂 holy christ i'm dying. What a riot!
This is why you should never trust gingers 22:32
My favorite late show host.  My god, I can't wait to watch this.
Conan: I told Bea Arthur, you have 4 more years to live.  Also Conan: You can't predict the future.
what a legend
Conan's bound for a journey like Homer (Simpson) after eating Guatemalan insanity peppers. I'm wondering if he used the same trick Homer used.
By far one of the best!!  Great job fellas! 😂
He goes absolutely crazy but still takes the time to answer the questions politely and respectfully. That's how you do it. Absolute legend.
Conan > hotsauce
Insaneeeee
Greatest Hot Ones ever.
Best episode ever!
Conan Hot ones king!!!!
Conan is insanely brilliant in this episode ... What he did with The Bomb was like taking a folding chair to the head and not blinking ... 😲😲
Best episode ever.
This is absolute gold! Been a long time since I’ve watched something and laughed aloud while on the toilet 😂
😂😂🤣😂🤣 I peed my pants
You say this is pure pepper (EATING INTENSIFIES)
GOAT
Wish i had that level of energy
This was the best! 😂
I've never seen Conan try so hard
21:13 He loves the pain
I actually sat thru this entire thing
Best episode Ever!
jesus, he's almost as chaotic as eric andre
I've been watching hot ones for years now.  And I've always thought Conan was ok funny but this was the best episode I've ever seen.  EPIC
Conan shouting out the fantastic literary piece that is Don Quixote, what a guy! Respect.
🐐
Conan wanting to get the sauce on all the soft tissue that he can. What a guy.
Conan is the irl version of chow from hangover. :D
That was about as funny as a lump in the back of my throat😳😜
Conan is a literal god.
This is the interview I wanted from Steve-O
Best episode ever! 😂😂😂
I feel so bad for Conan... he'll be destroyed for days
this is everything ive ever wanted
What a legend
The funniest person in history.
It's so hard to not only stay relevant for 30 years in show business but to also still be considered "funny" and not outdated the older you get especially to each new younger generation. Conan deserves a lot of credit for that.
BEST EVER!!!!
My depression doesn’t stand a chance against Conan 😂❤
I sort of get the feeling Conan was making fun of the show by being so absurd
"I YAM WHAT I YAM" - Popeye    -Gandhi      -Conan O'Brien
Conan is the best!
What a performer  Pure performer
Finally someone with talent!
I was laughing so much the whole time. Hot Ones is usually so on the rails, with a bump or two along the way. Conan's arc here was like watching a runaway freight train launching over a cliff. So good 😂
This might be the greatest Hot Ones episode of all time
My favorite late night host doing hot ones. This is going to be good lol. I’ve been waiting for this one for so long!!!
Next to the Gordon Ramsay episode THIS is an instant classic!!
Hot ones will never be the same again.
Conan UNHINGED!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is amazing, was having a truly heinous day, this was good for my soul.
Phew, I'M sweating just watching him dump ALL of that sauce on those wings.  Good night!
That was the most impressive thing since the David Blaine episode.
I love conan
I didn't like Conan until I saw this.
The best episode ever.
This is the top of the mountain! Absolute greatest. I honestly don't think there will ever be a better episode.
❤Conan is the GOAT 🐐 🙌🏼! This was the perfect season finale!! The man is legend!!!❤
Conan is the greatest late night host of all time. Craig Ferguson is no 2.
All Bow to Conan... "The Mother-Effin Man!"
conan has absolutely lost his mind
This just makes me wish Chris Farley was able to do hot ones!
My life is complete now
Best episode, wow! Real fun
Conan: "So, we eat really hot wings while you interview me?" Sean: "Yeah, we usually..." Conan: "Hold my hot sauce cap..."
Best ever
...wow.
three words. BEST GUEST EVER!
Conan O'Brien is the goat.
contender for best guest of all time
Conan is the first man to put fear in Sean's eyes
Best episode ever
“Are you even really a doctor?”   “I should be”
What’s the difference between Conan, ghandi and popeye?      None.
Conan is the only comedian who can go over the top like that and pull it off. I think anyone else would get annoying, but he is just a master of unabashed comedy. Curious to see if he can surpass Gordon Ramsays views. My favorite episode.
Hands down the BEST guest ever!!
one of the funniest shows here 😂😂
Conan is insane. But he is a total legend my god
Conan guzzling hot sauce like it is milk.  His first guest on MAX should be Jenna Ortega.  They can do a re-match on the hot sauced and see who survived with grace and panache.  It sure would not be Conan.
They don't call him Conan 'Fire Crotch' O'Brien for nothing.
24:00
Conan is the absolute GOAT. This is him being his most self-effacing, hilarious self. A true legend and a national treasure above all others.
That's a man who commits to a bit.
This is the most iconic Hot Ones i've ever seen.  Conan is The Man
Conan turning into Lews Black was fantastic
COCO IS THE GOAT!
We were promised this back with Milla Kunis, it finally came!
Conan continuing to remind us why he is THE best. 👏🏼
This went about the way that I should have expected
For someone who wants to make the nation dummer is wrong
Jesus Christ, Conan! Hahahaha
🍪
Finally My favorite show host! And the best I've seen yet Conan never ever disapoints
Best episode in years.
Best hot ones episode ever
Had to ask my doctor if I took acid whilst watching this.
Conan turned into Frank from Its always sunny at the end 😭
Legendary stuff
This was peak entertainment! 10/10 💯 it’s going to pass some time before we see another episode of this level - it will remain in the top for a while… I don’t see anyone else of this caliber unless you bring Jim Carrey to match this up! 😎
Anybody noticed he put Da Bomb back down? I was waiting on him to get to that one!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Plot twist: Conan has covid and can’t taste😂
Wow!!!
1 million views in just 10 hrs. Conan is a American treasure.   Now when we getting Jordan slansky.
Conan the Showman. The greatest to ever do it.
Conan is awesome
Best episode ever!
Conan the destroyer of peppers! Best show since Gordon Ramsay. Incredible wing drop at the end!
Conan O'Brien channeling rick sanchez at the end. This was just incredible entertainment
Legendary, w000000000000000t!
Hes taking trophies 😅😅😅
Let’s see how this Epstein island visitor takes wings and not kids
Can’t stop laughing 🤣 legend for sure!
This was glorious. Conan is and always has been great.
Conan put Steve O too shame
This was the greatest episode in hot ones history! I couldn't stop laughing😂😂
I didn’t think they could ever top Gordon’s episode but this is by far the best hot ones ever.
Conan's comedy style falls into the 'Clown' category.  Big Red is never subtle.  He always delivers a Super-Sized Happy Meal.
Conan is very much unhinged and I'm not sure how I feel about it.
Conan went to Harvard. 23:12
CONANNNNNNNNNNN
I have been watching Conan since around 1993 when he started doing Late Night and he still surprises me.  He's simply the best!! A sauce boss if you will.
oh my gosh. He has blown all of your other guests away
Wasn’t expecting Conan to outdo Steve-O…..😂😂
Conan - absolute LEGEND of comedy and a TREASURE of a human being, undefeated!
This is so good.
Two legends.
These are normally so genuine.  This is such a weird interview.  I am the unpopular opinion here, but just. My ears and brain are tired.  Conan.  Oof.
Wow, all I can say is wow
OH MY GOD! HE'S UNHINGED! 😂😂😂
I love Conan, his comedy is wonderful. I don't watch hot wings, and the hope of having another guest like Conan is going to change that.
Best episode ever!!! Hands down ❤
jeus dude. how has Conan gotten even funnier in the last 20. im about to pass out from laughing
lol,  Conan never misses lol
CONAN we effin love you man!  Best episode!
Conan O'Brian is madness I love it.
Nobody is going to top this.
Conan waxing eloquent about reading Don Quixote while a tipped over bottle of hot sauce slowly dribbles out onto the table in front of him is pure poetry.
Conan is the absolute champion of the world. My HERO 🥵🫡
Wow! Conan brought it! I thought he was going to go down in flames, but no!
Conan is the greatest person whoever went to Harvard
I had a family member check on me because I was laughing so hard
I haven't laughed this hard in years. Thank you Conan for being absolutely ridiculous!
i love you conan
This is the greatest Hot Ones episode, if not the greatest interview of all time
at 60 years old is insane
What a beast Conan is. Respect
The wings are supposed to break down the facade to get genuine gut answers. Conan broke the show lol. He wins, I’ll watch his show lololol
Conan is an absolute legend! ❤
there goes my hero, watch him as he goes.
That was everything I had hoped for from Conan and much more
Haha Conan is a beast
I wonder what the sovereign nation of Taiwan thinks of Conan...
Greatest episode of Hot Ones of all time
Absolutely legendary
He still remembers the name of a cameraman from almost 30 years ago. What a chad.
Has to be the best guest on the show yet.
Finally a guest I want to watch!
Conan went BEAST MODE!!!🔥🔥🔥
Conan is an f’n maniac🤣
Greatest Hot Ones episode EVER!!! This will be hard to top.
I love Conan so much
Best episode there will ever be. Wing drop.
What a season finale. Conan was born to be a performer, I can’t picture him as anything else.
I was not prepared for this interview. AT ALL.
Conan is the best. Just hands down.
I imagine this is how a hot ones interview would go if the late great Chris farley were still with us. What an episode that would be.
Finally, a rare spice-lord has appeared!
He needs to be the next joker 😂
This prophecy is fulfilled
"I'm fine" as he's beet red , drooling, bloodshot eye
"You're not a doctor, are you? " "I-I I should be"
jhc , this me heartburn & indigestion  ., maybe even a lil brain damage
20:56 🤣😂 I fuckn love you Conan
Is Conan Obrien gonna be the next Coolio, like are we never gonna hear from him again?????
check his pockets... how many did he actually stash
Conan's a living legend
The rare physical comedy Conan comes out. Nice!
Best guest of all time
The regret on Conan’s face at the end is YouTube perfection!
There's never gonna be another Conan.
Conan going King Lear crazy is what I'm here for
This is the best episode ever! Who could top this? How? Conan!
I know he had to take tums after chugging that hot sauce at his age 😂
Conan’s simply the best!!
Best episode ever!!! Love Conan ❤️    I remember Conan even showing his bruise to the audience it was huge! The buffalo encounter must have been wild. You can find it on his YT channel.
Where's Sona and Math?
21:03... win
Best episode
FINALLY. Literally my moist anticipated mash-up.....and it did NOT disappoint!
But I’m gonna do a wing drop!
When crazy meets insane
Truly, truly unhinged. Conan is such a legend.
Conan seems very desperate for attention.  😢 He’s doing too much to prove himself to others.
Best episode ever...Conan is a legend
Absolute legend.
he needs a doctor for how bad his propaganda trip to Haiti has aged.
The last 5 min is pure chaos lolol
Luv this man. Greatest talkshow sat nite ever.  Sean, please invite Jordan 🙏
I never recognized how big Conan’s head is… 😅
He's not the best but he's affordable 😂😂😂
undeniably one of the funniest and smartest people who have ever lived. he hides his genius by acting as a jester, but Conan's social IQ is off the charts.
MAGNIFICENT!
This somehow surpassed expectations
Conan is an awesome individual. This was a dope episode
The Best ever ❤
King of Hot Ones! 💯👑
Conan Hot Wing Barbarian 😂
He stole my idea for Da Bomb! Best episode to date.
Do Jordan Schlansky next!
Conan O’Brien is a national treasure, also not human.
I had to scroll through the comments to figure out whats going on cause this is insanity. Not even a drop of snot? Not a single tear? The man is show over matter. And yeah its hella gross😅
BEST HOT ONES YET!!!!!!!! CONAN KILLED IT!
Im watching the show
easily the best Hot Ones guest
Conan o legend
What an icon
"What's wrong with me, why can't I feel?!?"
This is easily the best Hot Ones! Conan came in cool, and finished red hot. Dude is a legend. Im so glad Dr. Arroyo is keeping an eye on Conan's health.
one of the best episodes, Conan is giga chad
Conan's gonna have bad time. Stuff can be so spicy that it burns on your skin, especially under your fingernails.
Sean and Conan.. I hope somehow this show makes its way to Kevin Nealon's eyes,...that was excellent entertainment. Challenge to Mr. Nealon to give it a try.......🦅
Yup this is the most unhinged episode yet 😂😅
My year is made! Thank you for having Conan on the show! Time for Mat Pat yet?
G.O.A.T.
This is by far the most I've laughed watching Hot Ones.
What an absolute legendary showman, and a legendary interview platform.  🫶
Even while foaming at the mouth, Conan was able to give an inspiring speech❤
One of the best comedians of our time. ❤
Finally an actual good episode with a celebrity who has an interesting character
Ok he was better than expected, Conan is the goat 🔥 best podcast 💕
This is the best one, right?
This one gotta go in the books.
Conan killed it! 😂😂😂😂
He D E L I V E R E D !
By far the best one yet.  😂😂
This is the most UNHINGED episode ever!! 😩💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Long Live CONAN!!
I haven’t enjoyed an interview this much in a long time. Conan O’Brien is definitely “national treasure” status! The final drooling speech was epic. Gingers can drink more, require more anesthesia, and clearly can handle hot sauce!
Best Guest
Might be the funniest episode of all time!
Legend!!!
Conen for the next JOKER!!! 🤣
Wow…..I can’t imagine what tomorrow is gonna be like.
Standing ovation from the audience over here. So much love for Conan.
All these years of Hot Ones has been building to this one perfect moment. Thank you, Sean. Thank you, Conan. Thank you, internet.
Just cancel the show now. There's no topping this episode.  Bravo!
This is why this show exists. It completely  breaks down the guest to be as vulnerable as possible.
Conan did not disappoint, love that dude
Conan is a gem!  This has to be the best Hot Ones interview
The Gordon Ramsey episode has now been eclipsed! 😂
Going from Ice Spice to this interview is like climbing Everest starting from the Marianas Trench.
Watched it 3 hours ago, and again now….even funnier now that its obvious how absurd of a straight man he played the whole time.
Conan looks great! ❤  He looks like Wonka before he gives away his factory.
Wait Mr. O'Brien, you're drinking a candle. You dont want to drink wax, do you?
Conan is awesome. He’s so funny
Might as well stop the show here. This will never be topped
My god.... i'm not sure Conan is an actual human being.  WHAT a MACHINE!
Conan simply just won Hot Ones.
20:25 I IMMEDIATELY knew he was doing the Three Stooges🤣
hahahahah🤣
What if Conan was in serious pain the entire time, but had enough comedic fortitude to play it off as if he wasn't?
Best episode yet
The old razzle dazzle
And this is exactly why Conan is the GOAT
Thank you. Thank you so much ♥️
When I saw they released one with Conan, I made myself a bet that I'm gonna be crying from laughter. And probably watch Conan cry from pain. Very commendable for Conan to take the challenge despite not being accustomed to spicy food.  I whole-heartedly believed the doctor was gonna do a full check on Conan to make sure his old heart won't stop kicking from the spice shock.  Hahaha I'm so happy how the first destination Conan brings up is Finland (since I'm from there, obviously). As a place where there's a comedy vacuum, nothing there. People in Finland still love Conan. He started by being hilarious and somehow he turned it into a really wholesome and deep commentary. The music and questions definitely helped, gotta give credit to that. But he was still smoothly transitioning back to humour from serious talk. He seems to be really good at that, going back and forth but not being abrupt. Like he said "to keep up the rhythm".  It's so fascinating how youtube and podcast trend actually brought Conan the same opportunity others whose content couldn't be short format found in there. Like people who couldn't get in-depth discussion on difficult matters or science compressed to some minutes, who needed 30 minutes, an hour, 3 hours. And now Conan can have actual discussions with people.  And Conan truly fooled us again. Watching this I think I know why Conan became the thing he is. He just gives it all and doesn't stop to doubt.
This is the first Hot One's where I was in absolute tears. Conan is a LEGEND 🤣🤣
LEGEND COCO
I had no idea how much Steve-O Conan had in him!
hahahah what a maniac...gonna regret that in the morning
I miss hot sauce
Conan referring to Leno as "the other guy" had me rolling.
Telling Bea Arthur "I bet you have 4 more years to live tops". I'm dying
Can you get bretman rock !!
Oh my gosh. That was frickin great 😂
I just assume hes talking about Max Weinberg.
Conan is the GOAT
This is the best one ever
This is the first time I’ve been legitimately worried about a guest. I’m team CoCo all the way and thought I was about the witness something awful. What a G.O.A.T.
I forgot how much I love Conan
WHAT
I swear to watch every episode of his show after this performance
who knew Conan could be more orange lol
Conan is a legend. Best episode.
i nominate this as the BEST HOT ONES EPISODE EVER!!!!
this is in the top 3.  insane.  we need more Conan in our lives.
Lol i like a little cray cray😂
this will never get topped. evar.
Finally, a good guest after a bunch of terrible ones.
Legendary. Best ever attacking the wings and sauces!
Conan seems to be on an east coast promotional tour for his new HBO show (he was on Today show, Tonight show and Bonfire radio show in last two days). On a promotional tour like that he's got a packed schedule doing 10 or so interviews a day. He was probably going to continue doing promo stops until the show premiers a week from now, but chugging all of that INSANELY hot, 1 million Scoville hot sauce is seriously going to incapacitate him for a day or two. Any interviews he does between now and maybe Monday will have to be conducted via Zoom, with Conan broadcasting from his toilet.
This episode of Hot One's will never be topped. It's all downhill from here.
I like how he takes a shot straight from the bottle. That's just showing off. lol
He tapped in to decades of pain tolerance for this show
We all know that Conan did the Homer Simpson and covered the inside of his mouth with candle wax beforehand
Conan is a G 😂😎
Top 5 hot wings!
This was, by far, the BEST episode EVER!
This is about to become one of the biggest hot ones interviews
Max was his band leader for years, right?
The all-time best episode of this show; or possibly any show ever.
😂 took two shots of hot sauce. ❤ that's dedication  for show business
Now thats what you call a 'slow burn'
Unreal, I've a bottle of da Bomb, one drop and people can't speak for hours! How did he do that 😂
'not good'  xDDDDDDDDD
Numero uno
I needed something to watch with dinner.  My favorite thing to do after a long stressful day at work.  I open youtube and the two greatest forces for all that is good and holy came together in one video.  God bless us all everyone. I love Conan and I love Hot Ones
🤯
Just wow…TBH, I thought that Conan would not have made it to the end. I was so wrong. And disappointed in myself to not believe Conan’s dedication to provide comedy (and joy) to the viewers and his fans. Not only did he succeed, he basically torched the challenge with his unique, beloved and crazy « all-in » for comedy. Thanks Sean and thanks Conan. The interview was so good that in a way it was bit emotional as you could see that Conan’s been here for a loooong time. Hopefully, it’s just another period for him before many others.
Conan, you're scaring him! lol
I've always been a fan of Conan and Hot Ones, and the two combined is pure magic. I've never laughed more during a Hot Ones episode. Conan is pure chaos and I love it!
Protect Conan at all costs!
that was the most unhinged episode i have ever seen of this show 😂😂😂 i wish there was 30 more minutes of footage!! the best guest to do it wow 👏🏼🙌🏼
Conan O’Brien is a comedic and creative powerhouse whose genius I feel lucky to have experienced throughout my life. What a guest and episode.
Well, might as well put this series in the can - there will never be a better episode. Conan, please don't die from doing this; you're 61, brother
Finally someone who ate all the sauces like a boss 😅
I watching this on acid 😂
This was a tour de force
This just might have been the best episode of hot ones...EVER
Best guest
6:57 Wow! What a compliment for Sean! He absolutely deserves it!
THAT'S WHY HE'S THE GOAT
How many lines of coke did he have to do before the show to pull that off?
Best episode ever. I love Conan. I love hot ones. Conan rocks!!!
Affordable doctor is the winner 💯🔥
Sean couldn't follow Conan down this road
To everyone who watches Conan, is he always like this? 😅
Waiting for the day Conan goes on JRE
This is by far the best episode ever! Dying laughing! Hahahahahah
Holy
A true showman and comic genius. Today's generation has no true anything
Conan is fking losing it 🤣🤣🤣
Oh my god 😂 i was never a Conan fan but THAT was impressive.. maybe now I am lol
Easily top tier episode
What a legend!
I want to know how this man still has that hair
Wow!! Never saw this coming
This makes me so happy. Always have been and will be a huge Conan fan 🙌🏽
Conan is king..
Conan rules. Period!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I've never laughed so hard.
I’ll die on the hill that this man is an untouchable comedy genius.
This might become your highest viewed video. Or close to it
In my humble opinion, the best guest ever.
I rarely comment on things but seriously, Conan is the absolute GOAT, his comedies with his work staff are comedic genius and this here just really was the nail in the coffin, absolute GOATTTT of comedy
That was disgusting…
Congrats Sean and team..Another great season.. Love from the CHI ❤
Hoping we get a norm mcdonald question.
Conan basically doing Futuramas version of Nixon is amazing on so many levels 😂 this is one of the best episodes ever and i was honestly never a huge Conan fan. didn’t dislike him just never really watched talk shows but this was excellently and i’ll definitely be checking out his podcast!
Conan was never seen again.
I didn’t think I’d see Jose! Go Dr. Arroyo!
I can't wait until the Chill Chums discuss this "interview" in detail. Sona and Matt are going to have a field day!
He’s the best.
When da bomb hit, Conan is classic.
That was the best hot ones ever. I'll definitely be checking out some new Conan content!
I probably would tear up if I met Conan. I was running a very high fever and left his podcast a voicemail in which I gave his people my home address. In case he was in the area and wanted to stop by.
Mel Brooks directed this. The best episode of all the seasons.
Dude is insane in the membrane!   This one is gonna get the most views in the show's history. I'll predict that!
As if I even needed another reason to not only respect and admire Coco, but also to love him more. Nobody will ever be able to to this.
How does one become funny?  Read.
Conan has never and will never disappoint. This is what peak human condition looks like.
Hey Conan, Max here, forgot to tell you that we're postponing your debut.
This confirms that Conan is not from this planet.
It is ridiculous how easy Conan makes it look to have such an overpowering yet welcomed and appreciated personality. The timing (I am sure the first sip of hot sauce came after the first wing he felt worried about), the precision in the madness, the deepness of the answers and the equanimity while SIPPING Da'Bomb will likely be the high point of Hot Ones for years to come.
THE most impressive guest I've seen in years!!
Greatest show ever🎉
Thats my talk show host right there, LEGENDARY!
The wing drop!!!
He couldn't stand the thought of going back to his podcast and being mocked by Sona and Matt for no having handled the wings well... bc of that, we got this masterpiece of performance
"You can't predict the future!" "In the year two thousaaaaaand" I hear Andy sing in my head
Next up Jordan Schlansky :)
This is the best episode I ever watched!
and this is why we've been wanting a Conan episode for so long! i love him and i'm so excited for his new show ❤
Conan, you are one funny man. Thank you.
Best Hot Ones episode ever?
Conan Top 5 all time appearances!Right up there with Gordon Ramsey. Once again this man has etched his name in stone as an all time GOAT. Long live the king of late night!
Conan for the love of god go pump your stomach!! This is going to be agony 😂
Conan and Sean epic episode 1#
Oh. My. God.
Conan destroyed this wing challenge 🔥
ill have whatever Conans having 23:00 hes unstoppable
Conan is a gentlemen, that was really cool to watch. That guy is on a completely different level of intelligence. It was fun to see Sean just chilling and letting Conan take over the show lol. What a compliment btw!
I never screamed “nooooooo!” So much
How are you supposed to top this?! The show is over :O
ELECTRIC. THIS MAN IS A MONSTER.
20:30 I can't stop laughing at the Curly noise
We all love Conan ❤
Conan just rewrote the steps to atack the hot wings, the new GOAT of hot ones, this is the bes episode I have watched in all these years. just simply amazing!
I adore Conan 🩷🩷🩷
That was a long 27 minutes
Conan! Conan! Conan! 🎉
This has got to be the best interview ever.. I now have a certain level of respect for Conan now..
Dude showed up with a affordable doctor and disrespected every hot sauce on the line up. This is why Conan is a legend 🙌
Is it me or Conan lookin high?
Dude looks and acts like a deranged dementia patient. His commitment made it hilarious, though
😭😭😭😭
This was entertainingly cringy 😂
This is the greatest episode of anything. His Ricky impression is amazing.
That was a journey
1:41 come on Hollywood Upstairs Medical College was right there!
Legendary
Conan is and always will be a legend!! 🔥
AMAZING!!
Conan is amazing, great work!
Conan will do ANYTHING for a laugh!
sean must've been so scared 😂
ohh connan  i love it
"what's funnier than Don Quixote" has me laughing out loud at work.
Why Conan have to stunt on Khalid like that
The person who did Conan's makeup should have to do the last dab.
So what Conan is saying is that Bailey hated him lol
conan is the best
Conan giving the fans what they want.  Legendary.
This was incredible. Love Conan
Man! That’s was funnier than I expected!
We are such idiots. The algorithm must stop pushing the stuff with the most comments. It's just unhealthy. Maybe likes ok, idk though, but enough comments.  Anyway.  This is my last comment, and I'd like to dedicate this to my mother, and also to my sister. Yup. It's their fault.
Legend
This was inspirational!!! ❤ Conan is the GOAT of late night!!!
Greatest episode ever.
This just makes me think how much of a joke DJ Khaled is
This was the ABSOLUTE BEST EPISODE EVER!
“wise and stable man” with the camera completely focused on a drooling mess of a man
Now that is the funniest man I have ever seen.
Funniest episode yet.
Pure chaos....good lord....lol I love it!!!
In the year two thousand.....I'll never forget that bit.   Conan is the late night king
I friggin love conan!! Cant wait for that “max” show to come out
I love seeing Sean not have to baby anyone through the show. So fun.
Conan o’brien is a comedy genius. Being that smart and being that silly.  unmatched lengendary status
Conan has set the bar ... on Mount Everest.  Future guests, don't even try!
This is how you put on a show ladies and gentlemen.
MAN what did i just watch🤣 that was a masterclass!!🤣🤣
one of the goats in comedy show hosting comes finally mila kunis did the curse hahaha
LOVE this guy.. Almost no haters unlike Corden or Ellen
Legendary 😂😂😂😂
Guys, I’m scared.
Officially the greatest episode in H1 history
Conan is seriously the best
Conan is a savage! 😆 🤣 😂
This was the hardest I've ever laughed at this show.
Best guess ever! Cracked me up😂😂
Conan O'Brien never fails to entertain. The man is pure entertainment... and brilliance.
For me,...Best First We Feast to date.. This was a great interview and comedy gold!!!!
I've never seen Sean as speechless as today hahah. This is why we asked for Conan for so long. Maybe not one of the best interviews but sooooooo entertaining!!
Two giants in showbiz and you get a show like this. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 THIS is entertainment !!!
Conan just ruined it for everybody else no one is topping that
Wing drop, this was a top 3 all time episode.
21:05 WHAT IS HE DOING
Maniac!!!!!
Conan is such a legend. So much respect for the guy. Great episode!
Amazing- about 10 memes were just born
Dude went wild on DaBomb. What a legend
commenting to boost algorithm
This is Greatness😂😂
I feel bad for whoever the next guest is. Because this episode isn't going to be topped for a long time.
I love how Conan commits to the bit! What a freaking star.
YES.
THEEE BEST ONE
He's gonna get a stomach ulcer for the bit you have to respect it
He really is long overdue with having Graham Norton on! And how in the world is Craig Ferguson not done this?? He's comedy legend!
This is the best one yet. I love Conan.
Best one ever!
One of your finest productions from team CoCo/Shawn❤😊😢
Conan you are the best !
CONNEY!!!! He NEVER disappoints 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 love him so much!!!!
Drinking the last dab sauce is CRAZY 😭. What a legend
We just witnessed Conan O'Brien devolve into Baron Harkonnen. 😂
So epic
this was fun to watch 😂
Conan!!! Yess!! Conan is a great!!!!
parts of this comes dangerously close to the Conan eats friend chicken AI meme. I guess the machines knew.
Best episode EVER! 🤣
This might be the most chaotic episode in hot one’s history😂
legendary episode
This is Groucho Marx level of epic
The best (period) episode  (period) ever (period). The best moment? Sean giggle muttering…”Oh no…Oh no…”
Well worth the wait
BEST HOT ONES EVER
What a MAESTRO!
Conan is Conan 🔥❤️‍🔥
The Irish guy had no problems with the heat. Conan might be the all-time greatest guest on Hot Ones.
What a great honor to have Conan compliment you in that way ❤
Best one yet .... hands down....
If you watch this immediately after the ice spice episode, it is like watching 2 completely different shows. This has got to be one of the best ones yet!
Greatest episode ever 🙌🏾
So you have chosen death.
Finally someone special! LOVE CONAN FROM 🇧🇩
what a legend.  great interview!
Conan has got to be clinically insane at this point.
This is absolutely one of, if not THE best one. Amazing.
Kudos to O'Brien for his commitment to the b... show. And to Evans for keeping up with him.
Best Guest Ever!!!😂😂😂
this was several masterclasses at once
Conan doesn't do The Last Dab....  He does the 5th, 6th, all the way to 10 baby...
Omfg
21:09 was veeeery Chris Farley
17:32 there we go
incredible
This is a God-tier episode. 🤣🤣🤣
Maybe the best episode of Hot Ones ever. Which I know Conan was shooting for. He really needed a career bump. 🎉
I want to see Stephen Colbert take this challenge go through all late night hosts I wouldn't mind seeing  Trump take this challenge
Conan is way more than just a talkshow host. He is a great intelligent improviser. He has visited many countries and treated them with love and respect. He is never really political. He is here to laugh and for is to laugh along the way.
legend.
BEST EVER
Conan's the only reason I'm watching the full episode for the 1st time
I've always loved that Gandhi quote
Conan walked off this show straight into an ambulance that poured charcoal down his throat in a tube. 😂
Nod to Sean was a class move.
good luck with the cramps conan 😬😬
Greatest. Episode. Ever. I love how Conan hijacked the show.
Conan’s A-hole is going to be burning for 2 weeks straight
Best. Episode. Ever.
"Dr. Aroyo, check for a baseline pulse."  ... "It's there."  That is such a brilliant joke.
this was long due
Nothing could have prepared me for this masterclass. 10/10, no notes.
Instant Classic!
19:30 21:23 23:00 I am very dead! 😂😅 God love ya Conan! Thank you!
Best guest ever- I mean it's Conan-he always leaves us with nuggets of wisdom no matter
Conan is a beast
Legend!
Been watching since season 1 episode 1 and this is by far the best episode I have ever seen 😂😮😊   💯 loved every single second!!
Conan o'brien? More like Conan the Barbarian!!!!
I am so glad I share a birthday with Conan, LOL... epic.
Reading all these comments before I finish watching are really adding to the experience. What a legend.
Best episode ever
At last a celebrity who actually is a celebrity.
BEST EPISODE EVER!!
Conan is a savage god, a true living legend❣️ I love, love, love Conan❣️ I LOVE this episode, I cracked up, I cringed, I needed this❣️ 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Where’s Sona?
Conan unhinged is the best Conan. honestly, I dont see how there is a better episode after this one. for real was laughing for 55 minutes straight.. (i watched it twice)
Conan the goat fort is one of
Mad respect Conan and Sean
This is mostly a bit for entertainment but I've tried the the hot sauces they are quite tame
It never ceases to amaze me how I can not laugh at Conan, no matter how impressive he is.
Circling back to the max joke after all that carnage! What a legend!
Standing ovation at home here
Nobody will top that ending. Conan is fearless!
"Da Bomb" humbled another one😂😂
8:08 can I get some explanation to what's happening in that picture?
Didn't know I was a fan of Conan O'Brien until today. Who woulda thunk.
This is the best episode of Hot Ones. Nothing will ever surpass this.
That was amazing by him
Legend
ABSOLUTE LEGEND ❤❤❤ I never saw this coming even though I knew he was a genius
I already loved Conan O’Brien but this is easily my favorite Hot Ones guest of all time.
I think thats a really clever answer regarding his touring show. Its not a show to answer some random common questions. Its a show to leave you with even more questions you wouldnt of even had, that perhaps you educate yourself
I hear he was escorted to an ambulance 🚑 in a straight jacket and is on bed rest at Cedars-Sinai  😂 -As were his wishes
AMAZINGGGGGG!Never saw anyone eating those wing as much as him and still having the intelligence to think clever and fast in answering.
They don't make 'em like that anymore
If anyone is wondering about Dr. Arroyo's day job when he's not doctoring: He's comedy writer and cartoonist José Arroyo.
Finally!
Conan putting wings into his coat is the best😂
Man !!!… Conan drank hot sauce !!!. This reminds me when we used to do that back in primary school !!!. He also defused Da 💣 hot sauce… Respects and love his shows and yours. What an amazing episode… Regards🇶🇦
One of the best shows yet. Conan is a legend
I got heartburn watching this episode. Conan is amazing as always.
Wow....That was....um...WOW!  That's all I can say 🤣
The crazy thing about all these Talkshows and every day shows over all those decades, starting with Johnny Carson, how many episodes, specials, just thousands of hours of great entertainment are lost.  If ppl didn’t have VHS recording, we would have nothing to this day. Even a lot of tv series are missing so many episodes. It’s just crazy how we didn’t think about conserving them back then
Even Conan's snot was pretty.
Long live the king of comedy!
Conan.Phucking.LEGEND !!
21:16 - "This is to you! CALL THE WIFE!!" 🤣🤣🤣
This makes me want to watch the Shia episode now.
Two legendary hosts in my books.
I can't breathe, what a legend
Is this based on a true story? 😭
“Dr Check My Pulse!” *”it’s there.”*  😂
This is by far the best episode you’ve made! Conan is the man
This is the best
Dude got launched off of a live animal because he’s stubborn and Sean thinks he could stop him from pouring Da Bomb on his wing. He would have just poured more if Sean tried.
🇹🇯🇹🇯🇹🇯
Conan never fails to impress
my new favorite hot ones episode, pure gold.
That man is a Harvard alumn
I love this man so much, this will never be topped
The legend that is Conebone69 ! ! !
Conan is a LEGEND! He was a legend, he is a legend and he will always be a legend.  This is the best episode of Hot Ones
while waiting to watch Conan O'Brien Must Go, I suggest people to try out Madventures S01 or S02
I think I was not prepared after work to see what happens at 21:07
Conan, King of Hot Ones  This is the best episode hands down and will be very tough to beat.
This is Epic!!
really amazing to get such props from a senior interviewer, even if its what we all already knew from watching the great work of the team of this show, great work, love this !
Conan did that like a G, 👏👏👏👏
This is by far the best Hot Ones episode I've ever seen. And I've seen every one of them. And yes, that includes Weird Al's episode, which I can't even contemplate is somehow not number 1 anymore.
Im sorry to all the other guest that will arive in futher season cause no one is toping Conan
Legendary episode
10/10
CONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN OH! BRIENNNNNNNNNNNNnnnnnnn!!!!
Conan frantically advertising his show at the end with Sean laughing was the best part
Absolutely the greatest Hot Ones ever! I was literally in tears laughing!
Best guest ever
Conan is truly gifted. Lmk next time you're in Montana!
Conan is the new Da Bomb!
This is the 1st episode since the series started that i did not enjoy
Most epic finally yet! What a savage!
This mfer is wild I can't believe what I just saw. I'm surprised he didn't pass out good job! One of my favorite episodes and I've seen 90 percent of them
Best guest in a long time
LEGENDARY PERFORMANCE!
If Hot Ones can be won, I think it's just been won.
This is undoubtedly the best episode of hot ones ever. Conan O'Brien was my childhood. He is without a doubt one of the funniest men I've ever seen. Conan O'Brien is now the king of hot ones. Long may he rule!!!
This guy is something else….to do that with Da Bomb is f’ing crazy….I’ve tried that stuff and it’s no joke!
Conan must have drank a candle before doing this
Best Hot Ones episode EVER!
Conan watched these and really thought, “Everyone is too scared of these wings.  An outlier would mock the wings.”
Bad lighting gave Conan an H-stache. I bet he'll be führious when he sees this.
I think the real best part of Sean getting a compliment from Conan is that, because he's not just a funny guy or a serious guy, we still get those clips BECAUSE Sean is just so good at what he does, he always manages to be both humorous AND serious with every person so he's not as pigeonholed as Conan must have been as "funny latenight guy".
Conan O'Brien is legend, love this video
What a legend!!!! best hot ones ever
Conan went to spark fire on Sean's feet and gain his reaction.
"whats wrong with me? Why cant i feel?!" 😂😂
Conan just drastically raised the bar for every guest following him. That was incredible.
Conan, there’s no words that do you justice buddy😂😂😂
This is the demonstration of comedy being above everything, pain, regret, sadness, there wasn’t even an interview and it was the best. You can clearly see that Conan, wherever he goes, wants to do the best comedy ever, all the time, to first please everyone around and second to have some joy himself. There’s a lot to learn from this episode. A lot!
Take that Gordon Ramsay!
whats the point if we cant do this
Conan is a beast! Legendary!
I think Sean needs to resign because Conan just out hot winged him
His poor wife lol
Plot twist: Dr. Arroyo is actually a writer from the Conan show.
hes the goat for a reason. hilarious
F$&@ing Animal! Max is gonna love it!
It is a great episode, but him not being able to just stop being over the top was like watching Martin Short in an interview. They just never know when to just chill and be themselves and let the host and the audience just enjoy them instead of all of their crazy antics. I have to assume it's a defense mechanism
Hats off to Conan, what a beast.
Conan an absolute boss taking those wings.
Conan is so nice. He's trying his hardest to have a heart attack, just so Sean can get even more views. 😂
if theres a ranking to manhadling spice, conan is number across all seasons. what  a BEAST
Conan the great!!
I have never laughed so hard at this show in my life 😂
I would love to know what sean was thinking during the most chaotic interview ive ever seen 😅
This is a great recovery after ice spice 😂🥳
As a red headed clown, Conan has meant so much to me. Glad you got him on, great interview, forever impressed by the growth of this show.
This interview will be studied for the rest of human history.
I love that Conan can't help himself and has to do a Bit with the Doctor lol Probably my two favorite show hosts together 💜
Interesting to see Conan's uncontrollable compulsion to do bits collide with the hard, painful reality of Da Bomb. Hilarious.
Probably the best episode yet
Unhinged. Amazing.
"CALL THE WIFE!"
13:54 did Irish Catholic Conan just....
Conan is a BEAST!    I actually yelled NO at my iPad.  Lol
Love Conan glad he's finally here
Conan... the new Hot Ones Champ. DEEEAAAM!
I love that Conan gets superpowers when the camera is rolling. Kickboxing during a heatwave in Thailand(?), eating a sloppy Joe in Murderville while Will Arnett pours a whole bottle of hot sauce on it, doing the extremest version of hot winds and seemingly not breaking a sweat
Conan reminding everyone why he’s still the GOAT
Number one guest EVER!!
Conan "the fire" O'Brien
My GOD this was glorious.
He is... Unhinged. *LOL* I love it! 🤣🤣
Hardest I’ve laughed at an episode in a while.
Did I just watch Conan commit suicide on hotsauce?
Best episode ever
Gotta say Conan is always great. Best episode ever?
I’m scared..
Conan the barbarian!!! This episode is insane!!! The best ever.
Conan is a G 😂😂😂
Sweet Jesus. This is an instant classic.
Conan… the GOAT. What a legend!
Just going to pop this little time code here 23:00 ... do what you do best with it Internet
This is gonna be the best one yet..
this is the greatest ep yet
My absolute favorite episode of all TIME!!!
Legend!!  No one can top Conan on Hot Ones.  This was fantastic!
The greatest
Instant classic
What is going on. lol. Is Conan high?
Best. Guest. Ever.
I pray for everyone especially those that don't appreciated Conan.
what a performance
I'll always love this man. So brilliant. My face hurts from laughing so much
"It used to be called HBO but they found that was too popular!" This man never misses 😂😭
Dr. Arroyo just randomly coming in is HILARIOUS 😂
That's the best thing I've witnessed in my life.
Conan popping up left and right in my youtube recommendations everywhere....and I'm here for it.
oh wow
Best one yet! Love my boy Conan!
FUNNIEST HOT ONES EVER!!!
This has to be the most try hard dude I have ever seen. He is the definition of unfunny.
I love you, Coco!!!! ❤❤❤
This one of the best hot ones I’ve seen😂😂
Definitely top 3 best guest ever
“Arroyo, check for a pulse.”  “It’s there.”  I’m done bro 🤣🤣🤣
Who needs the gym when you can just watch Conan do his thing and get 6-pack abs on the couch?
Conan sloppily drinking hot sauce is not something I ever expected to see.
His colon is going to prolapse.
THE FLAMING C SAVED THE WHOLE SEASON and on the way, he surpassed just about anybody else that faced the gauntlet🙌 COCO ROCKS THE MOST🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man turned into the Joker by the end. :D
I think this is the best episode of Hot Ones ever .
Best guest ever!  Solid Gold!
I don't think another hot ones episode will ever top this
He must be back on this show. I’m not going to sugarcoat it. He must must must must be back on this show.
Wow.....
Why does he pocket the wings 0.0
This is one of the most harrowing things I've ever seen. When was this filmed... is Conan still alive?
Love it
Conan got high on wings😅
The world trip did so good for Conan. He looks younger and more energetic than in his later podcast episodes. He’s back to his non ageing process.
Norm MacDonald would have loved the doctor bit at the beginning.
Conan is the best of all time
This is the single greatest episode
best ever
Conan truly a showman for what he just endured for the sake of our entertainment.
We've finally reached the pinnacle of Hot Ones! 👏👏👏🤣🤣🤣
Did he just expose that it’s all been fake?  Unreal
Time to watch the ice spice episode again with conan as the reference
Conan is the best there is!
You know, if you told me Conan would be crazier and more reckless than Steve-o, I wouldn't have believed you. But my God, I had to stop the episode several times because I was crying laughing, and cringing in fear, and yelling "Stop! For your own sake, Conan! You don't have to do that!"
This episode is absolutely epic. 😂 Conan slayed.
This is going to be in the top reactions compilations forever
Best one yet. Bravo Conan and Sean
Absolutely disgusting and pure entertainment. Now I want to know how many hours he spent in the restroom the next day.
Conan realizing he made a mistake starting the bit of drinking and pouring the hot sauce on the wings yet refusing to back away from it is hilarious.
Ladies and Gentlemen…….we have a winner!! All time best… ever
Conan is so much taller than Sean lol
This was the best episode I've seen!!! Conan is a G!!! 👊
I had no idea Conan was this legendary. Never seen someone drink the hot sauce on this show… What a professional 🌟
Conan is my childhood hero
Amazing episode
Hands down the best guest on this show so far!!😂😂❤
The hot sauce didn't physically hurt Conan O'Brien, it mentally harmed him.
Petition to make Conan's "OH YEAH!" a permanent sound effect for the Hot Ones logo screen
this is the funniest Hot Ones i have seen and i’ve been here since Key and Peele and i thought that one was the best
"My intestines have turned into acid and I can still remember the plug! That's a professional!"  love you , conan
I miss seeing Conan’s videos on Youtube back in the day. They were always so funny and didn’t feel copy and pasted like the other talk show host channels
Best episode of hot ones EVER
Incredible man!! Just insane
Conan is such an astounding comedian that I forget how eloquent and intelligent he is, also. What a great interview!
This is amazing rofl
He’s a monster
Well, best hot ones intro I’ve seen. Doc needs to be a recurring guest where he gives terrible medical advice while eating hot wings  Edit: scratch that, best hot ones episode EVER.
Best Episode Ever!
the red goat
oh my god Conan!
I... love this man. Some of my happiest childhood memories can be attributed to his show(s). The world is a better place with people like him in it.
Only 1:30 in but I sincerely hope Jordan makes an appearance
Conan is my comedic hero
NO WAYYYYY. I BINGED CONAN OBRIEN SHIRTS
Brilliant comedy from a master..has now created a new generation of fans, Brilliant businessman, now will have more flocking to his podcasts and Max show...that was a show from a legend
Dear god this may be the best hot ones ever
One of the best moments in comedy
Best guest of all time
GOAT right here! Conan fckin destroyed this! I love it! Great man.
He is so funny😊😊. Great surprise to view this one
The most unhinged episode ever
We Need Ricky Gervais on this show
The greatestttt hot ones of alll timeeee LOLL
You gotta get Tre' Cool
Episode is up there with Ice Spice's appearance
GOAT
I love how worried Sean looks! 😂
😆 I was not surprised by Conan’s uneducated confidence but I was surprised by the level of extra sauce… a complete madman. 🫡
Probably the best episode ever, well done man. Next Jordan Schlansky! 😂
I feel a great sense of inner peace now.
#9 a total Chris Farley mpment
This video deserves the most viewed video of hot ones
i wish there were more like buttons
Best Episode Ever.
what an absolutely unhinged spectacle...  i love it...  😂😂😂
Probably the interview of the year
Please post link to water buffalo video! Conan rules!
Conan #1
I've seen so many Hot Ones episodes and this is my favorite one of all time. Love Conan! Take his amazing compliment about being an interviewer btw Sean it's special.
The fact that Conan brought his own joke with him (the “doctor”) is pretty hilarious. Like he wasn’t sure he would be entertaining enough on his own so he brought a backup bit.
"you're not a doctor are you?"  "i should be"  HAHAHAHAHA
THE BAR HAS BEEN SET AND DESTROYED
The funnest one yet!!!  I’ve watched them all!  🎉
Conan has taken the reigns from Halle Berry
All hail the Mighty CONAN !! You Sir Are A Hot Ones Legend !!
Who would win, 10 spicy wing bois, or a very pale irish man.
Friggin hilarious man, Conan is wild. Unbelievable how he could take that sauce. Freakin funny bastidge and best talk show host ever. Cheers 🍻🤟
Best hot ones episode ever.
Bet talkshow host ,  from USA
9:30 Did y'all saw Conan's hair bounced as he said "WOOO!"?
ughh
An instant classic, Conan is the best and he makes all his apparitions memorable
Carson, Conan & Andy, Craig were epic times in late night.  Thank you & 🍻
I feel like we’re witnessing history with this interview 😂
Seeing Conan do a publicity circuit feels like getting multiple remotes. I love it. We love you Conan!
If everyone doesn't watch his new show after this, I really don't think there's anything else he could have done.
Best episode ever 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conan what a legend
Conanna is a legend
I was impressed at first but then I remembered gingers don’t feel pain
He was acting like it's nothing but his eyes told the tale. Great composure, but i saw it. I saw the pain :D
Phenomenal, Conan!
Why didn't Jordan come with him! You missed an opportunity
Thank you
Best episode, hands down.
Conan progressively turning into Joker during the shoot
Conan is comic genius.
I interned for Conan for his last season and he was incredible! So kind and very passionate about his work. So cool to see him respect Sean’s hard work as well.
First ever:over doing it, thanks Conan.
GOAT.
Probably the best episode I’ve seen in a while 😂😂😂
His new show is the exact same concept as Karl Pilkingtons Idiot abroad.
Conan being Conan will always make my day.
You know its a good episode when you stop your chores and watch it without blinking because its conan in it. 💯👏
Connan is committed to the constant bit! Huge respect.  MORE CONAN!
Conan is the best man on television. Seriously he’s just above anyone else. What an interview.
Goat episode. Conan's the one😂
Conan is truly an American comedy legend
Put on Penn Jilette!
That was the best episode in a long time. Laughed all the way through it.
I thought Shakira was the final episode of the season
DA BOMB 16:27 ! ! !
He’s my favorite talk show host, he was the only one I would watch
Hear me out. dr Phil (Adam Rey)
This is one of the all-time best episodes, Conan killed it.😂
Lisan Al Gaib! Lisan Al Gaib!!!
conan lined his mouth and stomach with hot candle wax.
Never thought I’d see the day you actually get Conan.
"Can I get a baseline pulse?" "It's there" "He's very good"
He turned so red at the end, Conan WAS NOT ok😂😂😂
Hahahahaha!!! Well done, Conan.
I love Conan'Obrien!!!
Havnt watched it yet, already liked it. Conan is the man
conan is an amazing entertainer
Haha when he dismisses his Doctor at the start is too funny.
This man just completely destroyed every other interview there has ever been on this show. The prop doctor was the best thing ever. Conan is a comic genius. The hot sauce chugs, the rant at the end 😂😂
Conan is about as underrated as you can get. Funnier than all the comedians.
Without a shred of doubt, this is the best episode of Hot Ones! Conan is a legend, and he’s not here to remind us that he is, he’s here to make sure we never forget!
Have watched almost every ep of Hot Ones. My faves are Pete Davidson and Shia Lebeouf. The Conan Ep is now my number 1. Bravo. Laughed beginning to end. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Comparing this to the Tonight Show interview is night and day. Sean is way way better than Jimmy as an interviewer. **Also that Andy impression was spot on**
What a supreme. What a supreme
CINEMA. JUST. PERFECT. CINEMA.
Dr arroyo recurring guest? 🤔🤔
That is a great jacket, Conan! Even with chicken wings in the pocket!
Conan! Funny, intelligent guy.
Best episode ever.
Not sure how you're gonna top this one.  This was madness in all the best ways possible
This felt like an emotional journey for all parties involved. That was amazing.
By far one of the best shows I’ve seen to date you guys both killed it !
Nothing against him, simply was never a big fan of Conan      I am now
Dude absolutely SMOKED the wings and it's not being talked about enough
This might be the greatest hot wings episode of all time
Speaking for many, this was everything we hoped for and more.  Thank you, this made our day.
Legend
This is the best episode of hot ones to this day.
What a goat
He is making a fool out of himself...
Sean is a better interviewer than con. Sean actually does his research, so his questions are professional.
This is amazing!
at last Conan
Legendary.
What’s wrong with me!!? Why can’t I feel?!!😂😂😂😂😂
The only man alive with the Marilyn Monroe swirl.
THE ABSOLUTE GOAT
True showman!
This is the best episode ever
Is, uh, Conan still alive after this? Has anyone checked?
Conan's a legend!
THIS. WAS. GOATED.
never realy liked conan on conan show but he so much funnier non scripted and being himself. this was great!
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE have Charlie Rose on Hot Ones!!!!!!!!!!
No way he's not in severe pain lol
Goat Hot Ones guest. This surpasses Gordon Ramsey.
They don't make em like they used to. Conan is one of the best to ever do it. Love this man.
What jacket is that Conan?!!?
God, I love Conan.  What an absolute legend.  Best episode so far.
I'm laughing so hard!
Conan is the greatest all time
<3
Pocketing wings is crazy 🤣
That. Was. Incredible. Subscribed.
i knew conan was insane but bro..... wow dude... what.........
This is one of the best Hot Ones episodes ever. Conan's a good talker, and he's pretty entertaining all thing's considered.
you can tell he watched a bunch of episodes to understand the format and the style etc. and came in with ideas for funny bits. hes a comedic legend for a reason.
Drop the mic, turn out the lights.... Hot Ones has found its master :)all hail the king!:)
Echoing what so many are already saying and thinking. The was THE BEST!!! Fully committed. Powerfully energetic. Two of my favorite hosts from different eras colliding a a magical, awesome, chaotic extravaganza. 🔥 🔥
what a legend
this last dab almost gave me a heart attack
What have i just watched? I've never laughed this much
Coolio walked so Conan could run!
Has anyone checked on him after the show? 😂
can we get some youtubers or something....
He's on another level. Savage.
Remember he's not a good doctor he's an affordable doctor
Ive never watched one episode of this show and am so glad i did for this one. Conan is awesome!
Guy is crazy
I believe no one can beat Conan  on this show now😭💀
Best Hot Ones ever. Literally Lol
conan should play the joker
That doctor has great comedy chops
Only Conan can do a bit throughout the interview and have me rolling on the floor!
When the host, hosts the host.
The bar is set
I mean what an absolutely iconic performance. Always loved Conan but that was one of the most entertaining impressive things I've ever witnessed
Is this even "arguably" the best Hot One's guest ever? My god, were you NOT ENTERTAINED?! 😂 Absolute legend/ mad man. 🙌 We're not worthy! 😫
It was funny and disturbing
Leave it to Conan to take this finally above and beyond any expectations what an absolute legend
Give up. End Hot Ones. It will never get better than this
Conan is the barbarian . Robin Williams would be proud.
Clicked on this instantly! Love Conan!!
Conan Drops Trou & Flashes His Huge Bruise | CONAN on TBS  if you wanna see conan explaining what happened
Now Jordan Schlansky, please.
Conan is the anti-DJ Khaled
Love you Conan, but loose the hair flip in the front.
🎉🎉🎉 haha he is sick 😅😂😂😂
Oh Conan... it's gonna hurt on the way out too 😂😂
I didn't find one bit funny in this video, but that is perhaps because I am not American. I would have enjoyed a few more of the usual great questions from Sean though.
Conan is a living Legend!!!!
Ganster
Chuck Norris + Steve-O = Conan
This has to be the best interview yet. Conan just going all in and giving a bunch more. lol
Never pressed play this fast before and with no regrets! 😅❤
just pack it up Sean, this is the best hotones is EVER going to get.
This is most likely the best Hot Ones episode that has ever been, and ever will be. We're done here, let's shut it down...
LEGEND!
I'm glad that Da Bomb is finally what made Conan go "Okay, now I'm starting to feel it..." 🤣
The terror and amazement in Sean's voice as Conan pours more hot sauce makes it even better.
The man is world class at keeping up a rapport under pressure. We can see him slowly turning red and sweating though, in spite of it all xD
Conan legit gave Bea Arthur a prognosis on television 😂
Conan... Is.. and always will be... A legend.
this is the most disturbing thing ive ever seen him do
Conan!! The best 👌
Yikes ...Grew up Irish, In the USA(Ireland is in Europe), and is a die hard liberal who wants to take your guns away. He used to be my favorite as a kid. ugh
Conan is absolutely brilliant
One of the best episodes ever 😂😂😂
Conan is gold!
Mann....if i become just 1% funny of Conan o brain ...my world be the best ever
The guy is effin insane and i love the energy 🤣
Conan is living legend
I think he's got maybe 4 years left in him.
it almost goes off the rails about 14min in, then, da bomb 🤣
I've never noticed Conans eyes before
Conan is the Final Boss of Hot Ones
Utterly astounding performance by Conan.  Got to be one of Sean's favourite guests.
I've never laughed SO hard watching this show. 😂😂 Conan brings everything to the table! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Iconic
Love Conan flexing by sipping on the lower hot sauce bottles! Conan is my favorite talk show host of all time, his podcast is great, I really can't get enough of this giant orange man-child. EDIT: Excuse me, he sipped on Da Bomb and Last Dab bottles! LEGENDARY
Best interview of the season. Respect.
The best guest by far.
Every platoon in the Army had a Conan, wars are won on the morale boosting antics of people like Conan :)
I’m literally in awe! Standing and clapping for if not the best guest we ever had, it’s one of the best guests this show ever hosted. Connan O freaking Brien! WOW! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This is absolutely legendary. Conan never doesn't deliver an insignificant amount of nothing
That was hilarious! Conan is certifiably nuts! Can’t believe he was drinking sauces right out is the bottle! 😅😅😅
I may be Bias, but Best HoT WiNgS ever!
Surely Conan got a rough night after this
So many layers of humor. Really entertaining. Loved it!
Listen, I love this show, and I've never laughed so hard as this watching it.  Absolutely EPIC!
... Starting to feel Conan has grave mouth for spicy, the same way Shayne Topp has one for acid.
WHAT A FINALE!
Conan is a Natural Entertainer and a national treasure
if Da Bomb was a guest, it's Conan O'Brien.  20:57 should be the intro clip 🤣
Anyone else notice Sean never asked a 9th question? Conan ate the wing then rubbed the sauce all over his face and body while screaming and then they just moved on to The Last Dab and I dont think there was a question for that either.
YESSSSSSS
Conant got the crown! Off the chain😮!
He went full Jim Carrey 😂
Conan is a LEGEND!
still waiting for you guys to have MatPat on the show `
sean"s horrified face watching conan is  everything
My 👑
Those nips must have been on FIRE for the rest of the day.
The best one I have seen. Bravo!
Finally !
No WAY ive just been on a Conan lore, scraps and sketches binge xD lets get it
Conan’s the best guest ever hands down
Conan and Craig Ferguson are the only two good ones when it comes to late night
waiiiiiiit no effing wayyyy CONANNNNN
Literally one of the best episodes. I immediately want him back.
this was perfect
Conan never fails to exceed my expectations!
FINALLY!! 🎉
I've seen hundreds of these, and this is easily the best one I've ever seen. Amazing job, all around.
no wonder  the best guest provided the best episode
I stayed up alot just to watch late night with conan O'Brien.
Da Bomb always forces the truth.
I mean....nobody beats that.  Jeez.
GOAT!!!!!
Through out Hot Ones there's been some great interviews, some memorable ones, some really funny ones, but Conan's is the undisputed greatest of them all
Conan didnt write the Simpson episode where Homer covered his tongue in wax so he could eat the chilli, did he?
did he die?
My man. Conan O brien brightens my day. Not as bright as his skin. But its up there.
The king of hot wings
This is easily in the top 5 hot ones episodes of all time
🔥nobody ever destroyed this show like him!!! 🔥
lol went from ice spice to this, compete 180 in quality and personality
🔥 *THIS WAS THE FUNNIEST EPISODE YET!!* 🔥
The best ever ❤
Going to be hard to top Conan, what an episode. Best one yet.
So he calms down to do his show? Imagine how bored this guy must be sitting there night after night interviewing celebs when his mind works this fast and furious.
Best Hot Ones ever!
Conan always steals the show
This may be the best yet.
😵💀
This was filmed during the 2024 Eclipse.  Im certain there were 2 rings of fire that day.
conan is nuts
Got a feeling like I was watching Cave Johnson eat the wings.
unhinged 🤣
I hope konan doesn’t have a dog cause that dog will smell his jacket constantly
i was NOT expecting that ending
The late night king of wit is here! Conans the man, and he showed those wings what for.
This is easily my favorite episode.  Like, it’s not even close.  Sorry Eric Andre, Guy Fierri, David Blaine.  Conan wins.
16:25 Da Bomb reaction
Legend ty so much coco 😂
best hot ones episode ever. honestly
I love how professional Conan is knowing he was going to go full force into his bit on someone else’s show but not before giving the host his props. Also at the end making sure to shoutout the host of the show he was stealing again just to remind us he was the guest.
Conan for Oscars
legendary episode
The music was a little off-putting with Conan's jokes!
Conan? Who touched you?
❤
Conan is the funniest person alive imo
Conan is goated in the hot ones
This makes me so happy. Conan is my absolute favorite talk show host! I've been in tears from multiple of his remotes.
Best Episode Hands Down!
The way that towards the end his skin is almost as orange red as the sauce slathered on his face 😂
Conan O'Brien is a beast
I was low-key sweating at the end of this😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love that he had to tip all the hot sauce bottles down like he used to with his microphone on Ol' Bessie Lou. ❤
How many Conan fans were sure he couldn't possibly handle the Hot Ones, but he totally proved us wrong! Legend!
Thank you Conan I needed that
Oh my god 😲
Conan killed that interview.
Best guest ever up the Irish well done conan love you bro great show
Best episode ever lol
I love Conan. The acting skill is top-notch, the commitment is unlike anything else. Class act.
_YOU WIN, SIR O'BRIEN 🗡️_
Conan taking the best guest crown.
Man, the fact that he didn't skip a beat or a single syllable at the end is incredible.  Conan's a legend. The undisputed MVP.
Producer: we need to make more views Conan: get the water buffalo
Today we begin season 23 with Conan Obrien.
Untoppable. Sorry y’all, this should be the series finale.
Had a Chris Farley moment...so funny
this was so hard to watch
doesn't get any  better than this. it's all downhill now
I'm sad there was no talk of gerbils, Conan-kai
😂😂😂😂
I don’t think Sean has laughed harder. One of the best ep
Conan deserves a sauce named after him. The face. The hair. The life. Make it happen.
Conan is the GOAT. Of course he drank the hot sauce. He is immune to pain while making a joke. I would honestly expect nothing less.
Conan is one of the funniest people alive and he's at his peak right here. My god
This is the hot ones we all needed!
I've loved  watching Conan over the years. His commitment to his ideas is unreal. But I have to say he went home and regretted those decisions he made that day.
You try too talk but your lips have been  paralyzed, Haba vasa resident paparabo 😂
THE best ever. Legendary!
WE LOOOOOVE CONAN 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤
This has to be one of the best hot ones of all time.
Bro you guys nailed it. You couldn’t ask for a more perfect guest. So funny 😂
I would totally forget I put those bones in my pocket and wash it and ruin everything in the washer. :)
This gotta be the best episode ever!
Oh my god when he drank the bottle of hot sauce 🤣🤣🤣
epic!
“Which US president would make the best podcast guest on Conan O’Brien needs a friend?” feels like it’s engineered to be the absolute perfect question for Conan.
Just Conan... out here proving why he was the best to ever do it...
Best one yet!
Conan doesn't feel the heat from hot sauce, he just gets high on it.
I've never seen Sean so worried about a guest before, hahahaha.
Conan is so funny and entertaining at all times
One of the best hot ones episode, ever.
Did that scene from Nope also play in anyone’s head during the animation bit?
Ok I’ll hop it too … best guest to date!!! What a champion entertainer!! Legendairy 🥛😂
conans dedication to the bit through pain is absolutely insane
Wing 9 made him channel Chris Farley!
This was incredible 😂😂😂
This is gold!
Maybe the best...
Absolutely unreal episode. First time ive ever hit play again immediately after the episode ended
Best content award.
OH MY GOSH.
Don't watch the Ice Spice episode after this, guys. You'll be really disappointed 😂
Easily the best episode yet.
This show was the best!!!!!
This is the closest we're ever gonna see of what Conan on coke would be. Utterly fascinating yet completely unsustainable.
One of my absolute all time favorites, knocks it ridiculously out of the park.
Sean, how did it feel to get that vote of confidence about your considerable interview skills from Conan?!
We need a longer edit.
Conan to his doctor: “Where did you go medical school?” “1998.”
😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥
I've watched probably thousands of episodes of literally every single American talk show and most British talk shows imaginable, and I've never ever seen any guests in any type of sincerity say it's not going well. Only as a joke
This was one of the greatest interviews I've ever seen. Conan is an American treasure. The commitment was unreal. Bringing his own fake doctor. His semi-coherent rant at the end as his brain shut down from chugging hot sauce. All of this is Gold. I'll be watching his special.
Lisa " kids..lets watch daddy how he can handle the hot ones"......mother of god
There never needs to be another episode. We're done here.  Perfection has been reached.
Best Episode EVER 😲  PERIOD
The funniest hot ones episode ever😂🤣
Conan is actually the best
I can't be the only person who now NEEDS to have Sean Evans be a guest on Conan Needs a Friend, right?
I have always told everyone Conan O’Brien is the funniest ever, I’ve been validated, undeniable. Absolutely undeniable. A masterclass in comedy.
It doesn't get better for millenials raised by their grandparents than Conan
Conan is  a legend and one of the few i would actually be thrilled to meet as a fan.
Love this show, Conan was the very best🎉❤
What a pro!
Poor buffalo!
That's the greatest date for a birthday
Best episode in 23 seasons hats off to Conan going all in. Don’t play Texas hold em with this guy.
o7
lol oh my God Conan O'Brien lost his mind
Hahahahhaha I love Conan so much
Conan wins.  Best one yet.😂
Conan is probably my favorite talk show host ever
I almost don't know if any guest can top Conan. This was a 10/10 episode.
This might have been the best episode ever.  What a way to close out the season.  Well done!
Kathleen Madigan
🔥
I have never seen Sean laugh this hard.  Conan is the GOAT!
At 23:01 Conan speaking reminded me of Joan Crawford speaking in the film "Mommie Dearest".😂 At 24:57 Conan reminded me of Ash (robot) spitting out that milky substance in the film "Alien".🥴
Crazy that Sean has to end Hot Ones now.
This is better than Eric Andre's
My god did this man deliver 😂😂😂
#1 guest of all time. Wow. That's what commitment looks like from a true titan in the entertainment world. My stomach and face hurt from laughing so hard.
That is epic....🎉
When Conan was in Tokyo, I was living there and had a friend I grew up with visiting at the time. We watched Conan from a young age and we checked his Instagram and he was right around the corner from where we were! We dropped everything and ran to where he was walking and he walked right up to us and we had a conversation for a few minutes!  He made us do a group hug and when I said I was thinking to move back to America (L.A.) he told me not to, lol. Sorry Conan, I didn't listen!  Great memory and this episode is one of the BEST Hot Ones yet! He delivered!
Best episode of Hot Ones ever created. Thank you, Conan.
Conan is a blast. Making me laugh harder than anyone else since I was a kid. Glad to see he’s still the greatest
Meanwhile DJ Khaled...
Good luck beating that hahaha. What a beast.
Oh its gonna hit O'Brien....in about 4- 5 hours!
Best episode ever😩😂 Love Conan🔥
This is without a doubt the funniest hot ones episode ever.
Tucking away the wings into his pockets had me dying😅
I have never seen someone commit to comedy as hard as Conan can.
Dude Conan made MVP status for this one, hoooooooly!!!!
INCREDIBLE
CONAN THE BARBARIAN
Conan O’brien is built different
Beautiful
Holy wow
Finally! Ive been waiting for Conan to do Hot Ones for soooooooo long!
I think this is the last episode
Conan ❤
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!🧡🍅
333 dislikes? These people just absolutely hate life.
The true king of Late Night, ladies and gentleman. If the quote the 'show must go on' is a man, he will be a 6 foot lanky irish man with weird beady eyes and we will love him. Now we need to see, Sona and Jordan in the show. We need it. Please
My idol
I never thought that someone would beat Gordon Ramsay as far as being my favorite guest on this show! I don't even want to admit that, but Conan is definitely right there alongside him for me! This was phenomenal 👏🏾
I've been asking for this since season 1
This needs to be the most viewed video of hot ones guys!!!!
When he is drinking the hot saude
I love Conan 💗
Conan is an absolute pro!! 💯
Legend!!!!
WOOOOOO
Amazing
Conan never disappoints
i love you coco
“was it a 4 year degree?” “it was supposed to be”
What an absolute lunatic. Been a Conan enjoyer since my teens but he still blew away all my expectations of him in this episode. A man, paler than a sheet of paper, looked Da Bomb straight in the eyes and didn’t blink. Incredible.
Don't reply to this comment just like it........go
That was the best one
its been almost 30yrs now of this man making me laugh..
Man, Conan is the best.  Great episode!
6t
Only Conan would come on and start with an actor in a bit.
Love this
Careful around the nurps
He crazy
Da Bomb has Conan acting like Robin Williams!!!
First time I have fistpumped at the guest. What an ending.
Yoooo this has to be my favorite episode yet!!! Absolutely chaotic!!!!😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is why Conan will forever be the Goat bruh
Conan the GOAT
League of his own, no one dabs Da Bomb.
Conan is a poet of comedy, just love that guy. Probably my favorite FWF so far, keep it up!
First one to completely derail Sean?
The reddest red.
Conan Conan Conan, thanks for the laughs! (on the floor) This is how you do a wing show!
The shot of da bomb slowly draining onto the table as Conan rambles about Sancho Panza... incredible
No one better!
He is insane 😮
I love Conan to me as far as late night goes gold standard
love u Conando!
Conan better not have died from this
Conan is 61, so many years in showbiz and still is always at 110% How can you not love the guy.
My cheeks hurt
This was conan making fun of hot ones
Well... We have a winner. In a competitive field of all the preceding seasons, this makes a strong case for best episode ever. Well done and thank you.
Dude is a legend.
Please interview Conan 12 hours later
Conan is the man 👏👏👏👏👏👏.  😂🤣
It's cheating to go on this show with a COVID-affected sense of taste.
Dr Arroyo needs to be a fixture
My guy told Shakira she was the last guest of the season and that no one has failed the wings. Man's a savage.
Epic episode 😂😂
Turns out he shoulda been eating hotsauce sooner
Hands down the best and funniest segment to date.
Sure he’s a great interviewee/comedian, but you’re all glossing over the fact that he admitting to killing Bea Arthur.
Coneeyyyy
“YOU SAY THIS IS PURE PEPPER?!” lol
Is there anything Conan is not the GOAT in? True showbiz and comedy legend!
Back when I worked as a receptionist I checked him into the hotel I worked at- he is by far the nicest celebrity I have ever interacted with.
I always found it so baffling how a late night show host is funnier than  majority of full-on step up comedians. You really gotta respect Conan ,what a guy !
I almost threw up cuz I was laughing so hard 😅
🤨 Is Conan high on something? What is wrong with him?
For me, this was the best one yet. Hilarious 😂
Wow! Paul Rudd, keke palmer, and conan o’Brian. All my favorite episodes now, thank you 😂❤
SOBBING! I HURT from laughing SO hard! This is the best Hot Ones I have EVER SEEN!
Love Conan ❤️❤️❤️
Surely his sauces were tamed down. Or is he just crazy.
That was the best one ever, Conan you are the best
Conan is completely unhinged and I love it
I think Boston hardens nerves. Either that or its true that gingers don't feel pain. Let's not forget Bill Burr cleaned every wing. I always love you Conan.
Instant Classic
I have nothing to say but that I absolutely loved this episode!
Conan was made for this. He killed it.
So nobody gonna explain how Conan is capable of this? Ain't he Irish?
He’s not the best but he’s very affordable 😂😂😂
He stethescoped Sean’s tongue hahahahahahahah
Conan is a beast. I have never seen anybody put extra on all the wings. Absolute Beast! 👍
Conan is showing his age here.
Know what time it is now … time to get Nardwuar on here.
I didn't think Ramsey could get topped, but this is the best show of them all. I literally laughed out loud so many times.
easily the best episode of the entire series!! Conan is an absolute legend!!!!!!
best episode in a long while maybe ever
YEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSS IM SO HAPPY
Best episode EVER!!!
Conan just won Hot Ones.
I'm fairly certain he went blind towards the end.
Conan doesn’t fear death
Howling laughing!! 🤣🤣
I will forever love Conan
Lol, we need a behind the scenes of the aftermath. Poor, poor Conan.
This has to be my favorite Hot Ones yet.
That was incredible
Conan's neck getting so red
can't be matched, will never be matched
THAT is why I won’t do two shows a night. I won’t do it.  Godammit, that was amazing 😮
Conan is just a true gem! Protect him! 🫶
I used to think Conan was pretty mid but this guy's is nuts. I suppose I'll check out that show on HBO.
Conan O'Brien was the pinnacle of what talk show hosts could be. He is a gem of a human being. It's just too bad NBC execs couldn't see.
😱😦my face the whole time
Please get Nardwuar the Human Serviette on for next season.
BEST EPISODE EVER!!! LOL
Conan said those first couple wings were Irish Wings
Oh my gawd this is the best episode ever
Conan is a legend whether it's the Barbarian or the O'brien lol.
Been watching for a while and bar none this is my favorite episode!!! We all love Conan!!!! I had to watch this one again lol Sean, Conan is absolutely right you're an excellent interviewer an excited to follow your future like Conan's ❤
I don't watch Conan just for laughs, I do it for the soul!
Conan is a savage!! 😂
probity the best guest ever ......... love from hamilton ontario canada
No guest will ever top this episode 😂😂😂
This man is a beast
Ok I’m actually impressed with Conan and these hot sauces. I have Da Bomb at home and I would never venture to do more than 2-3 drops.
Conan's face is slowly morphing into John Wayne. 😂
if anyone else attempted this, their insanity will be questioned, but Conan gets praised, because he's the only one capable of it.
One of the top 5 best Entertainers of all time!
Conan is the man ! This is legendary
This is always what Hot Ones was meant to be. Finally we got the episode we never knew we needed. Thank you Conan and Shawn!!!!
Most amazing guest and interview EVER!
Hands down the best Hot Ones episode ever! Well done gents. 👏🙌
Haha, took it all out, Conan did😅 got a little nervous when I thought he downed a big slurp of the Pepper X.. could have been bad😂😂.... no one should do that, for any reason
Hahah 😂 must have had that doc give him a nerve block. . .
Conan is a great interviewee.
Been waiting for this one!!!  Edit: Wow he’s great!  Edit 2: LOL he’s starting to look like a bad case of make-up  Edit 3: 😂😂😂😂😂 i’m impressed
Never laughed out loud at one of these vids as I did with Conan.  A++
I love Conan, but this is an entirely new level to the man.  Absolutely crushed it, and as far as Hot Ones goes he is the new GOAT.  Even Sean was horrified/awed/humbled by how this guy literally bathed in some of the worst the show has to offer!  Oh, and props to Conan for voicing his appreciation for Sean's skill as an interviewer.  The show is great, but Sean really keeps it elevated.
For some reason I can picture Jordan Schlansky, trying to teach Conan VARIOUS correct ways on how to pour hot sauce and eat a hot wing and historical monologue on how it started. Then maybe bring his own hot sauce from Italy and brag how he has the hottest sauce he had gotten straight from Italy and then Conan will just drink it and look Jordan in the eye and laugh like a villIain.
Bro, Conan!!!  I never clicked on a video faster in my life!
Conan screaming "IM FINE!!! IM FINE!!!" while drooling like a baby, covered in about a billion scovilles all over his face has to go down in hot ones history lol
"Check my pulse" Doc proceeds to choke Conan from behind while pressing his ear so uncomfortably close to Conan's face, to only then answer with, "It's there" 🤣🤣🤣  I had to rewind the next question and answer because I laughed through it all 😂 It was like watching a bit straight from the Conan show
Unhinged Conan is how we all FEEL!! Thank you for this Hot Ones! Thank you!
Well, that escalated quickly. Mad respect to Conan who pulled through the hot sauces like a champ.
Amazing performance by Conan. Holy
CONAN IS PROOF GOD EXISTS.
Conan turned into Rick Sanchez at the end. Amazing.
My eyes! My eyes!
Conan is really an entertainer
Bringing a human comedy prop à la Dr Nick and putting chicken bones in his pocket is without a doubt one of the myriad reasons highlighting why Conan is King
What a legend. Pouring on Da Bomb and licking it off and still not freaking out like other who have a small bite. What a beast.
This is so good I love Conan so much
Loveliest shape of crazy in this guy😅
What a legend Conan is
5:31 "I'll remember these words." Totally forgot them due to the God tier comedic onslaught
This was my favorite hot ones episode!
The Legend 🙌🏽🙌🙌🏿
Is Conan wearing the same jacket that bill burr was wearing?
How do you top that?
This was a long time coming. I love Conan!
He's at the top fo sure
This is the GREATEST Hot Ones EVER!
The bomb dripping slowly on the table while Conan improvises an epic motivational speech. Epic.
He drank a candle before this
Easily the best episode ever.. gunna be hard to top
Bruh how tf... I honestly thought these were fake sauces until he finally admitted Da Bomb was getting to him. This man really drank hot sauce straight and didn't flinch.
Now let's compare this episode with the Dj Khaled episode. Here with Conan we have a smart person acting silly for good comedy. Khaled tried to act eloquent and smart, but only embarrassed himself and revealed his own stupidity. Respect to Conan here, he really is one of the best!
I think getting told by, arguably, one of the greatest late night hosts ever that you're a fantastic serious interviewer. You've probably made it..
Conan is my fav talk show host and comedian of all time! His comedy really helps me to continue living
❤❤❤
I think Conan just won the show. The greatest guest on this show of all-time.
Conan Coolio’d the last dab better than Coolio.
The wing drop says it all about the interview. Has anyone else had a wing drop?
Conan never fails to make me LOL or laugh so hard I cry!
Conan is so funny ❤
It's like he is trying to own the spice like @GaryVee!!! hahahaha
"Im fine!" Hahaha
He's clearly never watched this before the way he just poured Da Bomb on that mama jamma!
Best episode by far.... He changed the Hot Ones forever. Conan i love you
Conan bravo sir. Impressive
Without a doubt the most iconic performance in Hot Ones history and I don't think it will ever be topped.
Conan should be president.  He's THE mediocre man making the masses laugh. Incredible interview.
Literally the best episode of Hot Ones EVER!!!!!!!!! Love everything Conan does!
Most fun guest in the history of your show!
I think he did the homer and drank a candle before he came on😅
All I got from this interview is that Connan killed Bea Arthur
I really think there is something wrong with this man!
This has to be the best hot ones episode of all time. How will they ever top this? Conan is a legend!
I won't say Dr Arroyo was the _best_ part of the episode, but "was it a four-year medical school" "it was supposed to be” kind of sent me, not going to lie
Conan has been my favorite entertainer since ‘95. Absolutely unmatched talent. Interviewing legends, game meet game.
He did that with Da Bomb! Jesus!!!!!
What an unbelievable legend
Saw Conan and I immediately clicked on the vid
He's the king. ❤
I can’t process what I just watched. This was flat out amazing.
Touché Conan! 👏
Conan…what a LEGEND!!
the goat
Sean is half expecting Conan to die right there and then
Okay hands down...Conan is the best guest they've had!  Absolute wild man!  Can't believe he committed so hard to the bit 🤣😂😆
This is a rare episode in which Sean isn't the smartest person in the room. Conan's awareness is high and his showmanship is unparalleled.
mad legend
Naww this is the best guest you guys had so far. I'm dying 🤣
Jack black has a similar water buffalo story from the set of tropic thunder. The buffalo turned out to be pregnant and they named the baby Jack Black.
Conan went full on Paul Rudd and then went even farther WTAF! Hilarious...
Conan is a Hot Ones legend!
talking about comedy with sauce and wing bits all over his face has me dying.
Alright Conan probably just skyrocketed as the best guest on this show ever
Love you Conan! You are the GOAT!!
Perhaps the most annoying Conan has ever been.  You lose one comedic franchise to a rival and suddenly you become comedically insecure
This is the greatest episode of Hot Ones that has ever been recorded, no question. Enjoy the peak Sean because nothing is going to top this.
Sean the 🐐  One of the best yet; Conan is a good show man.
Conan went all in, that's entertainment right there.
I hope Conan is ok after the show….😮
I am in pain just watching that amount of hotsauce being consumed.
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!!!! AND THATS A FINALE!
I have never seen someone so willingly destroy themselves. Bravo Conan
Easily the best episode. Fight me.
Top 3 episodes of all time. For me, the best of them all. What an absolute legend.
Ummmm wow. New best one ever
CONAN THE BEST
He went slam beast mode!!!!
This is hands down the best episode of Hot Ones!
Best episode ever.
I wonder how Conan feels that this format has mostly replaced talk shows.  Not his show of course. His show had to end first, before talkshows could die
This is your biggest get, IMO.  You've had plenty of A list actors, world famous musicians, and sports superstars...  But Conan is truly a legend in my eyes. Well done.
Poor Conan juuuust missed out on that HBO branding lol
Well, nobody is gonna top this one.
My favorite person ... never fails to deliver
It’s so funny 😂 when people are cocky in the beginning when Conan says “I don’t fear your wings Sean” I’m laughing like oh boy game on 🔥….
Conan really brings me joy
What an animal 😂 I love Conan
lol
Gosh....I just friggin love Conan. He's the epitome of happiness and funny. Just an outstanding person.
Such a good thing that Conan didn’t do drugs when he was young. 😮
GOAT
Finally someone, of course Conan, living this show just right👏
Probably the best episode I've seen.
He doesn't need a doctor
The ONLY thing this appearance couldn't top was Conan's farewell speech on the Tonight Show.  Just an elegantly eloquent, extremely intelligent, considerate and unbelievably kind and humble human being. No one on TV today does it like Conan does.
Conan is the greatest to ever do it
Sean af 16:45   I think he was legitimately shell shocked
Braggadocious!
Conan is chaos impersonated yet somehow still in control
Wow, well that was....something
Absofuckinglutely 100% pure gold Conan is a legend and this will go down as the greatest episode of hot ones you could close the curtains and be happy with how the series went
This is easily the best episode I've ever seen. Congratulations 🎉
Man this was long overdue but salute for pulling through 🔥🔥🔥
The commitment. 😮
I've got MAD respect for this dude!
Conan is an absolute beast, one of the the best hot ones episodes ever!
Get in there Cony, and sacrifice your body!!!
No seasoning till he was 52! That killed me.
who would a thought in the year 2000 we would be seeing Conan Eating some hot ones wings :D
I love Conan. Always such an amazing entertainer!
Best Guest EVER❤
Who is this guy?! 😂
How about a Conan interview with putipoo??😂😂😂😂
Turns out if you give Conan too much capsaicin he turns into TJ Miller.
Conans the GOAT
He is not a good doctor. He is affordable 😂😂  Classic 😂
This was absolutely hilarious!
nah this episode was too much for me xD
This was amazing
Wow
no way!
Conan is the man
Wing drop!! 😂
When Conan said"what's funnier than Don Quijote" after literally personifying the spirit of Don Quijote for the whole episode, I fell in love xD
absolute legend behavior
Wow, this has now turned into my FAVORITE episode of Hot Ones. I thought nobody could top the Gordon Ramsey episode, but here we are.
Takes me back to Coolio (RIP).    Hope Conan can walk out after this one.
Oh man, I haven't laughed that hard in awhile watching this show. Conan really did go all out for it. That man is nuts.  LOL
Amazing episode.
Conan is the absolute GOAT
legend
conan and real wings. 10/10
BEST EPISODE EVER
This was absolutely insane. Good job.
Conan GOAT O'brien
Best guest and episode ever
Conan went all in. And he didn't disappoint.
Conan For President
He’s definitely the craziest guest ever!! 😂😂😂😂😂 the end is legendary 🎉🎉🎉
I love how Conan was getting interviewed and giving Sean who is a great interviewer gems on the low. Conan is great.  P.S Conan looks like Ms. Doubtfire😂😂😂😂😂
We’ve entered the CONE ZONE
This might be one of the top episodes ever of all time
No one can ever top this. Conan is the G.O.A.T. of the Wings of Death.
Conan dived right into the deep end of the pool with this. I swear he got a few shades redder. The Irish be proud. Great finale to the season with an awesome, crazy, fun guest.
Conan is by far the best guest ever and a great actor because I know how hot da bomb is. Great show
Just that conan’s Last bottle, the pepper x, looks very diluted… not concentrated as yours, Sean
conan own the show
That was absolutely the most amazing show of all time.  I thought Aubrey Plaza snorting milk was the gold standard but this blows it away.
Conan is a maniac! 😂
Conan has never let me down and still hasn't, the man has kept me and so many others entertained for years. An absolute legend walking. Paired with Hot Ones, this was absolute perfection, thank you Sean and Conan, but also thank you to everyone involved for making it even happen!
Conan is the man 💪
HE IS INSANE! Conan is feeling it for sure! Best episode of Hot Ones for sure!
All in for the show! I think Conan's goal is to have max views eventually
Half way through this episode, already the best hot ones I’ve seen.
I give Conan about four more years after ingesting that much hot sauce
That was absolutely spectacular.
I always thought of Comedy as makeup. Your enhancing what you know and what's around you, so a good comedian can you make anything funny. Doesn't mean everyone in the audience will think it's funny, but that doesn't actually mean it's not funny
Braaavoooo
Man, conan's a beast. Was the best first we feast episode
“He’s very good” is giving Lucille Bluth 😂
The best episode yet! Conan is the best!
OMFG What a finale ahahah !
I kinda knew he was loco, but... uh... jinkies.
GOAT! Best Hot Ones guest/episode ever! From this day until the last of all days. Conan still most entertaining person alive.
Conan melted candlewax on his tongue before coming on.
Vintage and savage CONAN
Congratulations Sean, everything else is inevitably downhill from here... How on God's Earth can it get better than this?
Oh my God
HAHAHA!!
20:27 I've heard Conan make that sound a million times before, but now we finally know the origin of it
This is like when the first contestant to win Who Wants to Be a Millionaire just broke the show and left everyone incredulous.
@21:00 might be the most epic moment in Hot Ones history!  And there have been a lot of them!
BEST EPISODEEEEEEE
The bones in the pockets...Conans a genius 😂🤣 best episode.
this is amazing
EPIC! Leave it to Conan to take it to a new level! ❤🔥🔥🔥
GET TIM ROBINSON ON THIS SHOW 🙇‍♂️
CoNAn O’ Brien for my money best late Night host there ever was. Past ‘ present will check out the MaX!!!!
I was waiting for the blood to start leaking from his ears & nose 😅
Was he on coke 😂
Has some checked on Conan since?
Conan is so funny
Instant classic.
Honestly watching his art since a teen I feel like Conan maybe the one individual that has made me laugh the most. Sad?  Nah, Conan is a freaking treasure 🔥
Greatest Hot Ones episode ever. ❤
I don’t think there will be an interview to top this one, and I haven’t even seen it
i've always loved conan but just now he became my hero
Impressive Conan.
Okay it wasn't matpat but I was not disappointed.
“can i keep this” 😭😭😭
Wouldve been nice if he mixed all sauce at the last part..just like how he mixed all beers when he visited samuel adams brewery😂
90 seconds in and Conan couldn’t prove any more authenticity in his brand.
what’s wrong with me - WHY CANT I FEEL 22:30
Wow this reminded me how much I love Conan
Literally the best show yet ❤
I think they can end the show now.
Legendary episode with a Legend.
Highest showmanship
Amazing... just amazing 😂🤣
🖤
This was the most unhinged legendary interview on this channel to date…
I love Conan!!!
This guy is mental illness in pure autistic comedy form…
This is not an interview, it's a masterclass
Love it!
In 15 years of youtube, this is my first comment.  Conan shines a light on the dire state of american healthcare using humour thats operating on soo many different levels - legend!
the master
CONAN IS THE MAN! 😂😂😂
Anyone else terrified he was gonna touch his eyes? Conan is the Mankind of comedy.
He checked his tongue 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pure gold!!! 🤣
Conan is a once in a generation comedian and host. They really oughta clone him.
finally someone interesting first 2 mins
BEST. EPISODE. EVER!
Absolutely epic episode. CONAN = GOAT
Hahaha, I knew this episode was gonna over the top, and boy I was  right. Laughed so hard during this wild one. Awesome episode folks. Very good way to finish the season! :D
Conan is a G
THE BEST!!!!!
Marshawn Lynch!!
Amazing, just amazing
Conan is a Machine!!
This puts the DJ Khaled interview into an even starker comparison.
Best episode ever 😂!!!
Best episode ever!
Incredible
Wow. This was Gordon Ramsay Level good. Best Episode in years! Thank you for this!
Kids, stay off drugs… not even once
Without a doubt the single best Hot Ones episode ever. Thank you.
It took Da Bomb for Conan to get some color to his skin hahaha
Conan has grave mouth for sure.
Greatest episode of all time.
I honestly can't remember the last time I laughed this much 😂 and it only got better the longer it went
The Dr Arroyo bit is BRILLIANT here. JFC. 🤣
*Checks his pulse "It's there" 😆
I laughed so much. This is the best of the season!
“What’s wrong with the me?! Why can’t I feel?!”  Me too Conan… me too 😂
I can't wait for the memes to follow! What a legend!
I need a Conan health follow up after this one.
WOW! This is the most insane episode of Hot Ones ever... my jaw was on the floor.. 😂😂😂😂
Conan a legend as always. Strange no mention of Andy. Dr Arroyo….Max Weinberg in disguise…🤔lol
Conans speech at the very end made me feel determined in comedy and life.
And then there's ice spice🤦...
If this doesn't happen again in the future then the world will definitely be just a little more black and white.
during Conan's childhood a snack would be a potato
NOW WE NEED JERMA985
Conan is doing what Gordon Ramsey thought he was doing; incredible.
That was impressive
Conan is a living legend
Dude, Conan's the last dab speech teared me up a bit.
No reindeer were eaten in the making of this video....a glaring oversight.   Otherwise, fantastic!!!!   😄  👍👍👍👍👍
Bravo bravo. I've seen Conan here and there for over 20 years and he has never failed to make me laugh. bravo👏 👏
No one compares to The Mighty Conan!! Wow!😂
That IS a beautiful suede jacket
Poor buffalo :(
The literal GOAT!!!!!!!!
This was arguably the best episode ever! 😂
Instantly one of the best hotones ep. Good job conan ❤😂
Conan is not human! A beast! He has no feeling nor taste buds! This guy's is immortal!!!!!
"What the absolute f*ck, O'Brien??" - Conan's drycleaner
Crying over this! Absolute gold 😂😂😂
Conan almost took over his show😂 conan is the best
I would never have expected Conan to be on Hot Ones but it seems very necessary
What an absolute menace. I love it
Conan wins hot ones
This has changed everything
Why is Conan eating wings the grossest thing I've seen?
Conan is king. No limits.
I feel like we're going to get bad news about Sean at some point. Just my gut talking... and has Diddy been on the show?
This just made my year. Truly the GOAT
24:17 getting Charlie Chaplain's Great Dictator vibes! We're not machines! We have the love of humanity in our hearts.
Conan being Conan.  👌
Conan is the man did it better than anyone.
Best episode of ALL-TIME!! You’re beloved, Mr. Conan O’Brien. Come back to Late Night, the world needs you. Cheers 🍻
WHY CAN’T I FEEL
conan is the greatest of all time
This episode is amazing for me because until Conan retired I always dreamed of being on his show, now I dream of being on hot ones. So this is like my two favorite interview shows colliding.
I love Conan!
Conan is electric in this! Pure gold
kinda looked like donald trump after he rubbed that orange sauce all over his face
Conan !!
Conan is too funny, one of my favorite hot ones ever, Conan is timeless.
Nothing can top this 😂
I expected this to be great, but the second he put that first wing in his pocket, I knew it was not going to stop escalating.
This is what Chris Farley would be like if he was still around today
Man I have really needed this interview for a long time. Been watching Conan for 25 years and Hot Ones since the first season. This might be my favorite crossover event ever.
TOP 5 INSTANT CLASSIC!
This man is a mental BEAST 😂
Does anybody know the music at the 4:30 mark? Is it just royalty free acoustic?
Gingers can tolerate more pain and the significant amount of emotional abuse Conan has received from his father has prepared him for this.
Legend 😂
The way Conan poured that hot sauce.. haaaaaa
It's an easy day at the office for Sean when the funniest man in the world is his guest. Conan and comedy are the same thing.
Man he absolutely killed this interview
Conan the LEGEND
😱😱😱
The greatest episode ever!!!
I love my Coney
There were a number of awesome guests on the show. But I think we can all agree that we've finally found the true GOAT!🤣
He's a beast
Conan was the best to ever do it
Doctor checking his pulse...."yeah it's there 👍🏻"  Absolute comedy
Is Conan the new Bill Murray
I know about Conan from lego batman 3
Don't usually Comment, But this episode was comedy gold! I always found Conan funny on late night but this is a whole new level at 16:50 until 18:00 I was rolling.  I am now a Conan O' Brien fan.
this is the best episode in a while. well done all
Man I feel sorry for his rear tomorrow!!
Conan is an animal
Never clicked so fast on a hot ones episode.  And Jesus Christ Conan is the best comedy writer/host/ podcast & now without doubt hot ones guest and slayer of the wings of death.  Hope they talk about this on their podcast 😂❤
This was literally the greatest Hot Ones episode of all time.
I freaking loved this!!!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂
What a legend, maniac and insane genius Conan is! Haven't had a laugh like that watching a yt video since a long time! This wasn't a season finale we deserved, but one we needed! I think this might have been the # 1 Hot Ones episode ever, and there were some really good ones before!
This segment taught me that Conan O'Brien is much more intelligent, funny and sophisticated than I gave him credit for. I really wasn't expecting much, but I was so wrong.
They are never topping this episode
Legend
His makeup is melting off
This has to be one of, if not the best hot ones episode ever! Amazing 😂
Can't believe Conan is 60 years old.
Alton brown and Conan both took it like champs
Man I love Conan, so great😂
I don't care...conan is the king of comedy
👑  Get this man a crown Sean, Conan O'Brien is the King of Hot Ones!!!  👑
Gotta be up there as one of my favorite episodes
Unsurprisingly fantastic - the only thing this was missing was Sona losing her mind with laughter in the background... I'm sure Matt & Sona have seen the episode already, but if we somehow got their reaction watching it for the first time on the podcast it would be amazing.  Anyways, amazing performance as always Coney 👏
He’s not a good doctor, he’s an affordable doctor 😂
His game face was rock solid right up until Da Bomb 🤣🤣🤣
Conan describing how to sell comedy in the tundra makes me think about Karl Pilkington. I think it was in his Idiot Abroad series, but they basically sent him out there into this frozen wasteland, and he had generate comedy out of nothing. In his case I don't even know if he was trying to be funny. He would just be miserable all the time and make the funniest observations, and that would be funny in of itself.
GOAT status
Could ANYONE top Conan's performance here ?
I'm not even that much of a Conan fan, but this was the best episode ever
Easily the best episode ever.
Scientific studies have shown that redheads are less sensitive than the average population to capsaicin, the component in chili peppers that makes them “spicy/hot”, suggesting redheads can handle spicier/hotter foods than non redheads
Best Hot Ones episode? It's definitely a top 3. No debate
I’ve been waiting for this moment since this channel started. God bless
conan is brilliant
Didnt expect anything less from Conan
Big c brought the joker persona to this one. What a great episode. Man liked da bomb like he was a dog
he should be the new joker
Sean's whole deal is that he tried usin hot spices to save himself from hair loss but it's not working, 30 something seasons in. But that's not how you do it Shawneault
I want to watch the whole uncut version of this interview
Conan is GOAT talk show host of the 21st century
This is officially my favorite episode of Hot Ones!
Conan does not have the ability to disappoint
Seriously the best Hot Ones ever.
Conan is a freaking savage.
Best... Guest...Ever...
I’m in my office watching this and crying
Love Conan!!
that was amazing.
I love Conan! Best guest ever..
Coco has gone to infinity and beyond!
Conan doing a bit during this was absolute gold!
Conan + Ramsey = best collab ever
That was wild af!!!😂
With all the respect that I can hold for your previous epicurean guest none, and I mean none, can hold a comedic candle to Conan's blowtorch. Great episode.
What he did with Dabomb was just legendary. I can’t recall another guest doing that.
I’ve been watching conan since the late 90s. I’ve missed him a lot and this episode got me dead asf !
That was amazing. Chicken in the pocket almost immediately.
I love Conan, so of course I instantly clicked, but I still wasn't prepared for the greatest hot ones episode ever.
Greatest. Last Dab moment. Ever!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Conan is awesome!!!
Conan was the most chaotic guest I think we've seen and I loved every second of this.  I stand with Coco, I did 10 years ago, I still do now.
Easily the best episode
Gotta love Conan!
This felt like seeing robin williams one more time. I have no other words
i dream of going on hot ones and i wished to do what this man did today, he beat me to it.
Daddy conan
It's official. Conan is the reigning champ, and absolute GOAT of Hot Ones.
Conan killed it. 😅
Good lord. Lol!
In true Conan fashion this was an absolute train wreck, but i loved every second ❤
This was epic.
This episode broke me. I laughed so hard my stomach hurts. Conan is an absolute legend.
Everyone thought Conan couldn't handle the sauce, but if you saw him eat at Sloppy JalapenJoes, you knew he had it in him.
I love him so much
Good luck topping this
This is like the spider men pointing at each other meme. Arguably the greatest there ever was to do interviewing cosigning the next interview prodigy. There's never been an episode like this, got me crying laughing out loud at work looking like a crazy person
Conan is just crushing it!
HARD STOP! THE BEST HOT ONES EVER! CONAN YOU ROCK!
tf... this ep. is a RIOT 🤣🤣🤣
This is hands down the best episode ever! I don't care who comes on in the future! Legendary!!!
I want his drug dealers number
This has to bw the beat episode ever.  Conan's performance was a incredible
I LOVE CONAN!!!!!
Conan single-handedly saved the show from its plummet from Ice Spice 👏🏼
One of the most unhinged things I've ever seen, it was amazing.
Conan was and will probably always be my favorite host and TV personality.  What a beast.
Conan is a literal living legend, what a guy. He made me laugh so hard with this one hahahaha
If intrusive thoughts was a person... 😬
CONAN SEASON FINALE WOW
Bro, when he poured da bomb on the wing i was like someone needs to warn coco. But nahhh he licked it afterwards . He deff the goat to do hot ones.
BEST EPISODE🎉
This was incredible - I was literally yelling at my phone NO CONAN DON’T DO IT! 😂
I need Jeff Probst on the show
Sean looked scared  by the end of the interview.
Just brilliant
What a brilliant and funny man. He might be the funniest man in the world.
i love you conan
Conan... does NOT look good! That said, he's sharp as a tack and hilarious as ever
Legend.
Ive watched dozens of these interview and this by far; has to be the best one of them all
Oh man Sean's face at 22:42 😂
this was the best Hot Ones ever
This is GOD TIER 😂🔥
4:03 Tame Impala reference
I was not prepared for the him putting the wings in his pocket
Greatest episode ever! Conan will always be the GOAT 🐐
Best guest so far, without question. 😂😂😂
I think it’s safe to call him the King of Late Night
Conan is my spirit animal! That was mad.
Conan decided his bit was going to be acting like he wasn't bothered, and he committed to it 1000%. Amazing
Always fun with Cones!
The  greatest episode ever
This episode is an instant classic. I could not stop laughing. It's right up there with Ramsay's episode.
This was everything it promised to be.
“I get that a lot from your demographic” 😂😂 that was priceless haha
Conan is the best comedian we have today.  Period.
Conan the goat
I see Conan, I click.
Classic. The best episode ever!!!
I think this os the best hot ones interview yet.
Conan, please don't die!!!!!😅😂😂
23:00 - The look of pure desperation
this was the best!! gg Conan and Sean!! we need Conan again for a mighty hot one
My most wanted guest. I cannot wait.
Incredible
Conan is such a legend! He makes the Ice Spice episode even worst than Shakira's great episode did.
I DON'T FEAR YOUR WINGS, MAN!
My vote for Dr Arroyo being the full time on staff physician for hot ones.
Comedy genius 😅
This is the best hot ones ever
This was the PERFECT season finale episode 😋 I frickin love Hot Ones 🥵
I always knew conan is a badass but when he drank that sauce 🥵. He really is a beast.
Conan just destroyed this show!!😂😂😂 he's the best ❤
Best episode ever, this one and Shia’s 💯
best hot ones ever.
He took over the interview 😂😂
CONAN IS GOAT!
Conan is King!! What a legend this man is. Pure gold.
Move over Gordon Ramsey, we have a new Hot Ones Champion 😂
How can the show go on from here? Conan absolutely destroyed!
Has anyone ever poured on more of da bomb?!
This is the best one ever
Just another example of Conan being in a league of his own 🙌🏽
My partner bought the bomb beyond insanity for my birthday and tried it and I can't believe how crazy it was
What a finish.... Best episode next to Gordon Ramsey. Conan.... You are awesome.
I never leave comments - that was a great episode.
Conan is the best host of all time. Also we share a birthday and his new show on HBO comes out on our birthday! Also Sean you rule.  Edit: ohhh they talk about it! I wrote the comment right after they announced the show. Sean’s research strikes again!!👏👏👏
Absolutely delivered. He just doesn’t miss. Legend.
this episode literally made me subscribe again, best episode ever
Fantastic episode
I thought him drinking the bottle was the top but it kept getting better!!!
I love Conan!!
FFS this was the best...cheers Conan
I sence sean felt uncomfortable, i.e. trying to talk to someone. 1st 5 mins funny. the rest is cringe, i got to 17 mins b4 sean and i got bored.should i watch more. too uncomfortable, i really wanna see how this person handles DA BOMB. Nah i'm out, sorry sean.
Conan is crazier than Steve-O
easily the worst episode ive seen
Has got to be in the top 3 best guests ever. Absolute madness
Amazing how Conan goes SO over the top to try to throw Sean off of his own game!
So good to laugh while watching this show. This almost makes up for the sadness that was Ice Spice.
He may joke around a lot but when you have a normal conversation with him, Conan is very well spoken and genuine
This is the first thing that really made me laugh this week!!!!
Best Hot Ones ever!!! Conan is a beast and a legend.
This gives me the impression that Hot Ones needs to step up their game. Apparently Conan thinks these guys had some weak stuff.
It's the only time I've seen Conan blush :) And it took half a milion scoviollies :)
This is my favorite episode, you have my favorite comedian with my favorite interviewer.  I can stop watching YT now, it's peaked for me.
Can someone tell me the background music at 19:00
Dr. Arroyo is not the best, bu he's affordable.  I spit my food 😂😂😂😂
"I bet you live - 4 - more years. Tops."
I always knew Conan was funny.
Conan the Barbarian.
hilarious superb episode
Top!!! The best!
This is amazing
For some reason would like to see Bruce Campbell on this after seeing this.
Conan is HANDS DOWN my favorite late night host. He’s a living legend
I will watch anything Conan is on. This man is the goat
Hopefully Conan will be a stepping stone to get Schlansky for next season's premiere.
Best hot ones I've watched yet and I've seen almost all of them
Oh my God, this was epic. I've had some of these sauces, and Conan is absolutely insane.
Conan the 🐐
Best. Episode. Ever. Conie for Prezzie.
watching was so painful hahahahahhaa i love it.........he is crazy and I love it hahahahaha
This is the best and greatest thing that the internet has provided in quite some time. I feel alive again, and I didn't even have to ruin my GI tract in the process!
I never really viewed this show as a competition but Conan just won
Lol i started this at 1.25x... lol and they both got so goofy and chaotic... i had to go back to 1x... amazing 😅
You need to make a video for First We Feast with Mr Beast and a priest and they eat yeast.
I have never seen anyone eat that much on the show. Conan is not human!!
Take a bow, Mr O'Brien, you broke this show
god i love conan obrian
This was actually jawdroppingly good and fun to watch. He is the KING of comedy in my opinion.
Never would have expected the Conan episode to be crazier than Steve-O but here we are
GOAT
So ..  very impressive. I think he’s numbed up tho 😂 COME ON!
Conan just took over the show and Sean was enjoying it all along 😂
I've never seen anyone put that much on the last dab!! Conan is the GOAT!
This is by far the funniest and best interview on this show
Best one ever.
Conan’s an animal. Beat hot ones I’ve ever seen.
Top 3 episode. Absolutely wonderful!
MAD Magazine is funny.
Sean got Conan's best today, and it was epic.
I would love to buy all hot ones but there is too much sodium in them.
Cone Bone's whole 30 mins on this show must have been damaging to the senses lolllll.  What a G.  Total legend in the flesh.
Conan needs to visit again. Great episode.
THE KING IS MAKING THE ROUNDS!
Conan GOAT
The best Hot Ones episode. Undebatable. Sorry not sorry.
Conan is the best. This was an excellent episode! Dude is a superb entertainer!
This is life!  You gotta sit on it like a water buffalo!
Conan and I went to high school together in Brookline MA, he was the valedictorian at graduation and his speech was the most amazing thing I'd ever heard. He's also exactly 10 days older than me. Happy Birthday Conan!
CONAN CONAN CONAN 🤣🤣🤣🤣  a mad man with the hot sauce 🤣🤣🤣
Conan understood the assignment
❤  CONEYYYY 😂 fav episode ever! 😂😂
By faaaaaaaar the best episode ever!!!!
Y’all didn’t need to add all that dramatic music in post. It kinda took away from his performance.
Best episode, ever. The end.
Fantastic episode. In another universe, Jordan Schlansky was there too.
Sean, nervous much?
When sheer maniacal personality conquers the searing agony of 2.6M scoville 😂🤣
great way to end this season thank u sean  an conan
Conan is the GOAT
Pure Gold 🥇🏆Unhinged human Muppet ❤️
Doing that with da bomb scared me lol
No one better
Best episode ever
This is probably one of the best interviews ever. We'll done.
This is peak Conan. Dear lord.
This is the moment i've been waiting for in a very long time.
Ok Conan just took first spot for me on Hot One's beating Bobby Lee's episode
It's HBO Max in the Netherlands because there is a senior channel called MAX
well I'm sold! That was the funniest I've seen Conan
I haven't laughed that hard in a long time jesushaha
There’s only one thing I expected from Conan: chaos!! And he delivered 😂😂😂😂😂
What this man won't do for comedy.
best episode in your history. well done
Conan sees an episodes and understands what the bits and hooks are and says "OK let's take those and see what happens if we take them to the max".  Pure genius!
i love conan
First time that Sean doesn't mirror the hot sauce consumption of his guests
I think Conan may have broken the show…
wing drop lol
all time great ep right here
Conan is one of the most organically funny people who has ever lived
Oh my god. That was the best interview yet
I hope Conan put a few rolls of toilet paper in the freezer. Next day going to be a wild ride.
I wanna see Brittany Broski on this show SOOOO BAD
Man I gotta watch some of Conans Simpsons episodes after this. So many jokes reminded me of the early Simpons humor. Haven't watched hot ones in years but Conan pulled me in. Glad I watched. This was so good.
I've never laughed so hard watching hot ones 😂
Conan is a beast
Conan is insane and I CANNOT WAIT for his travel show. I love Travelman, but I already know this ain’t it.
Best. Episode. Ever.
Conan just got my love back
Greatest episode yet!!!!
Did conan survive this?
I never knew how much of a Conan Obrian fan I was until now .
Nice
How effortless he switches between comedy and some rather serious answers is something else!
Why out of all guests was Conan the most unhinged? 😂
Puts bones in pocket...🤣
Conan is the GOAT!!  *edit* hahahahahahahaha crazy af
⭐this guy⭐
Wow
Crying. Laughing.  Even with my massive Conan fan bias aside, this was peak Hot Ones. José's delivery as the Doctor as well was BRILLIANT.
I’ve been watching from the beginning, and I can say this one is the best one I seen so far. Conan is a O.G!!!
Oh boy!
I haven't been this entertained by one your years before
Sean looks so small standing next to  Conan.😂 Great episode. I was looking forward to this interview so much! Conan never fails to deliver.
Conan. What a legend.
A literal LEGEND........ among LEGENDS. Can't believe yall got Conan. This is so major. Respect. 🙌👑💐💐💐💐
Best episode ever
I have now seen everything in life. I can now die peacefully.
shaq should learn from Conan.
Conan is like a Grand Jedi Master of Comedy...watching over the years perfecting his style and culminating right here. What a time to be alive.
This episode was a convergence event in which every historical era of visual media delivery and consumption (network, cable, social, streaming, podcast) were embodied and transfigured into a transcendent 27 minutes of historical hilarity. Also, there were hot wings.
Best show ever 🤣🤣🤣
That was magical!
This was poetic.
Sean couldn't handle that chaos.
Conan the Destroyer!!!
I need aTheo Von, and Conan moment.
😂😂😂 so good
Best episode, hands down🙌
REDHEAD SUPER POWERS lol, they need extra anesthesia, too, wild or they can'tget put under! ...This is 💯 my favorite Hot Ones....Conan is my favorite. Been a die-hard fan of his since 1993 ❤️ TEAM COCO, BABY!!! This was great....I enjoy watching him be the center of attention. "Have some good time" everyone!
America incarnate
Conan raised the bar so high that i dont think anyone could ever touch it forget about surpassing it. Once again proving it why he is the GOAT.
Sean right on with Conan😂
genius idiot!!! He is proper funny
Glooorrriiiiaaaaa!!!
Red heads cannot feel pain!!!!
That's probably the funniest episode of hot one's I've ever seen 😂
Conan is the greatest!
Wow i feel like i have to watch conans new show now
GOATED episode
The mother fricking goat    “You don’t have to talk to him” hahahahahahaah   This foo putting in the wings in his pocket hahahahah
I swear... when he is gone, the end part of this video will appear on this tributes.
Dont know, what to say, Iam just stupidly smiling :D
When Conan had Da Bomb in his hand, I thought he was going to drink from the bottle and was so relieved when he put it down on the table.
I've never heard Sean giggle so much he hiccups, and i was laughing along with him. Legend 😂
So funny
Conan somehow made Steve-O look like DJ Khalid... 😂
Conan trying way too hard to be funny…not naturally funny at all
Going down in history. Conan sure knows how to promote and have a blast doing it
I never laughed so hard watching this show 😂 18:18 "in retrospect..." 🤣
amazing episode, bravo.
Conan went for legendary Hot Ones status!
CONAN!!!!!!!
Best. Guest. Ever. Can anyone top how bout it Conan was? Half expected him to pour da bomb in his eyes 😂
As GREAT as this episode was, im afraid of someone less funny thinking they need to try to outdo it next season and making an unfunny fool of themselves
HE claims I don't fear your wings, Oh you will Conan you will
I can't get over him putting the wings in his pocket. Why is nobody talking about this? lol
I love it whenever the drawn animations make an appearance ❤❤
Felix the cat…ect… R Crumb priceless…
NUGGET POCKET!
Conan the Beast
Conan is an absolute legend
This is hands down the best season finale ever! Unforgettable 😂
The way Conan starts taking swishes of hot sauce so non-chalant is pure golden comedy
Sona and Gourley are sooo tripping all over this episode 😂
CO’B is a talent that’s so needed today
Now we need Conan on Rogan
Couldnt click fast enough
Wow Conan is the 🐐.
... Not quite an interview. This is Conan trying to assassinate Sean Evans with the last dab
Honestly he could take Dana Snyder place for the voice of shake oh aqua teen. It’s like spot on
In the end, Conan looks like John Wayne staring dead into the camera. This is the True Grit of Hot Ones.
Conan is A DAWG!!! always loved that guy.
conan one of the few that can knock sean off his game
Take that, Khaled.
The episode I was waiting for!!! Love you Conan 💙🤍
We needed this after Ice Spice
Conan could be the next Joker ngl
Best episode ever!!!😂😂
The Irish volcano
I’m back here to show my respects
Conan delivers pure joy, as always. What an inspiration.
This by far the best one ever.
I feel this is what it was like with Conan in the Simpsons writers room.
Now do stivo,conan, and Jonny...... And we will have second best episode!!!)))
This is the best Hot Wings I've ever seen, Conan is THE MAN ! ! ! !
Hilarious interview!  Killed Da Bomb!  😂🫣😝
Hot ones has peaked right here
Conan probably saw Gordon's episode and said to himself "I gotta top that."
Best Hot Ones Yet!  Nice work and well done Conan O'Brien, up there with Halle Berry killing it! HA!
What happened to Conan after the cameras stopped?
Best guest ever couldn't look away
I knew it, it's an orange alien.
Who knew that you give Conan hot wings and he turns into Louis Black
I love him so much
There will never be another Conan. Period. Tip your hat. Hand him his flowers. And, applaud.  Knowing that most men won't be half the man he was right here. The Show Must Go On.
That was a wild ride best episode by far 🎉
Woah that was awesome
April 18 ? Really? That's my birthday too ! What a coincidence!
your move Letterman
What an absolute legend! How can anyone top that sauce consumption escapade? wow Conan!!!
Conan looking like a baby who ate some spaghetti in a high chair at the end.
By far Conan 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
conan the barbarian...  😵‍💫🤣  w i l d
Conan is hilarious 😂😂😂
This has to be the best yet.  Absolute chaos.
This might be the best episode i've ever watched on hot ones.   Conan's descent into madness was peak comedy😂
Conan has to be one of the most unfunny people to ever make it in show business. The material isn't good to begin with, and he overreacts as if he were a 5-year-old.
Greatest episode of hot ones ever
The commitment to the wing in the pocket bit was admirable
Hands down my favorite episode. This is Omega level awesome and how to embrace chaos.
lol u can tell he’s got the capsaicin high lol
Conan is so chaotic and I like it!
This is a goat guest contender. Conan, respect!
This may have been the greatest episode yet…
I knew this was going to be grate but it was the greatest thing every
Conan killed it.  I’m assuming he went to the hospital after that. 😂😂
Conan has an amazing wing span 🐔
Conan for president. Just don't eat lobster please
Conan might just get the greatest Guest ever award. He made it look easy and took it like a champ!
I have to seriously give it to Conan I haven’t laughed so hard during a hot ones
this was amazing. watching this on my lunch break. how am i supposed to go back to work!!
Conan is wild for that DaBomb sauce
I don't know if Conan is just a beast for spice or if he's been tailored to show no weakness from years of abuse and Irish turmoil...
not the da bomb bottle spilling out during his lecture 😂😂😂
I couldn’t look away
Conan just demonstrated that he does indeed come from a big family where when it was time to eat, you get in as much as you can as quickly as possible!
This was a curve ball even for Sean 😂
Top 5 Hot ones guests of all time, what a savage.
This is the best hot ones I've ever seen
Conan is my hero
It was hard to watch through the tears
@22:31 "Whats wrong with me why cant I feel".   I love it.
I honestly expected Conan to act no differently than he normally does.  The man’s an animal!!! 🤣🤣🤣
this HAS TO BE the absolute GREATEST FKNG episode of ALL TIME!!!!!! Conan killed those fking wings, the sauce, the crew, and the FKNG HOST......now i think conan should be the new host of HOT ONES....he not only earned the points he FKNG SPIKED THE BALL!!!!
FINALLY 🎉
This. Was. AWESOME!
i knew when i hit play that i was going to witness utter chaos and boy, did Conan deliver! 😂
This may be the funniest Hot Ones I have EVER seen.
Great interviewer interviews a great interviewer
This was insane holy god
We're making it out of Ireland with this one!
God bless your sweet Irish redhead. You took that like a champ
Heavy on emotions
But what about the gerbil, Conan?
That was so epic! Was not expecting how well conan handled the sauces and added and drank more of the hot sauces. An MVP here.
My god, what a ride. My head hurts from laughing so hard.
Cona
Best episode imo.
fianlly it happened
Best episode
Conan is out of this world. Best performer ever??
This is proof…Conan is THE GOAT. You will never see a talk show host this funny, you will never see a comedian this funny ❤😂
This makes up for a bad season! Conan saved it!
I’ve never laughed so hard for one of these episodes 😂😂
Bravoooo!!! Bellisimo show!! I laughed so much, thank you Conan!
Conan is King 👑
Redheads have a higher... much higher threshold for pain, medically proven.. Guess that plays a part or he is just insane :D
What's up with the underlying Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack? 😂
Cringest hot ones ever
The way that Conan hired an actor to play his personal doctor, he kept on putting wings in his pocket and drank a bottle of hot sauce just to show you how committed he is to the craft of comedy. That's why he's a legend!
Gross. I wish he didn't have to be such a clown.
That guy is unbelievable. What a legend.
I love this man ❤❤❤
honestly if you hadnt have told me this guy was a comedian.... I would never have assumed he had anything to do with comedy :/
Conan O'Brien it's a beast !! The man drank "The Bomb !" and all other "pepper X"  holy mother of god !  And he got a fever !!  oh my god !!
I think Conan was Possessed by a Demon 😈🤪😂
Best guest ever
Epic.... and this time I mean it!
4:38 thats because he can fill this vacuum
Bill Maher should be next!
Is Conan the first guest to go ALL IN on Every Single sauce!?
This just solidified my love for Conan ever since the 90’s 😂 that was absolutely hilarious when he got to da bomb
Absolute Legend. The GOAT 🐐 🙌
What an absolute mad lad 😂
This mf Conan goes beyond being funny just to straight psyco and i love it.
I've never clicked on a video so fast!!!
Sean looks so distressed at 22:39!  LOL
Fn love Conan, great way to close the season
Bro is just a maniac😭😭😭
He always gave me the creeps and I don't know why... something truly off  about him
Best interview ever
Great finally to your season. Hilarious! I couldn't stop laughing. He deserves your top award for the year.
WHAT A LEGEND!!
Hands down best episode in while and great finale ! I kept reaching out for a napkin not realizing i couldn't hand it to Conan because i was laughing to hard .😂
Conan... pure genius... hahaha... exhilarating & hilarious as always!!  This one is definitely Top3... for sure!!
I came here right after a serial killer iceberg rabbit hole video, so thanks Conan for giving me my soul back!! My knees hurt for hitting them LOL
This hole interview was truly hilarious! 😂
I can’t wait for the show Conan ❤ amazing show sean 🎉
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Now I've seen the best episode of Hot Ones ever. I'm gonna be surprised if it gets topped in the future.
i actually love him. from a millennial, he spoke from a plethora of experience, wisdom and a zest for life. Experiences build character.
Holy f**k.  They should probably just wrap up production because this insanity can never be matched.
Jesus. Fn. Christ. Best episode ever.
Jesus F Christ
The 🐐 of late night
this is the craziest one since Eric Andre
The dedication is insane
Best one ever.
Conan is superhuman!
6:02 I always wondered about that! Sean's asking the good questions!
How realistic would John Stewart be? Lol
didn't you say shakira was finale
This is one of the best Hot Ones. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Conan was on so many drugs filming this
Absolute madman! I don't even remember what he said but this is the most insane hot ones performance of all time!
amazing
im only imagining if some one skips from 3:54 to 23:00 XD
Why it’s……The MolecularMan! 🤣
This was a disappointment. But then I was the fool who thought maybe Conan was capable of having an actual conversation as a human being. Good joke—on me I guess.
You lied to Shakira
"Read wide and read well" - Conan O'Brien
Conan, Thee Legend.
Best show ever! Conan is an Icon, a legend and eternal
I could not stand Conan for many years, I now love him
a performance for the ages
Best episode ever
this is the funniest episode. conan really went for da bomb sauce.
Finally you got Connan!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
You'd think by now there wouldn't be a lot a guest could bring to the table to the wing eating portion of the show, but bringing his own "doctor" along and pocketing the bones... Just... Genius. And pocketing the bones is such a simple gag!
Who is Conan O'Brien? And why is she so sad?
That’s it. It’s official, the goat of first we feast! Conan O’Brien, best guest you have had period!
The best episode yet lol 😂
The wings in the pocket I can't 🤣 also this is the best Hot Ones i've ever seen.
Indestructible🧊🧊🧊
Legend!  absolute legend!
Unbelievable. Nobody, nothing anywhere- can top this. Mad respect.
Best episode of all time. Will never be topped
Hate the talkshow, love this guest appearance though! Finally free to just be? 👌
Is it safe to say that this was the most daring guest on the show? Aside from Steve-O putting sauce in his eye, of course.
Nothing can top Conan at this point 😂🙌
This is the best one I've ever seen
I love Conan😂
pls change the thumbnail to a 3/4 view of conan, the current one is scaring me.....he is like a phineas and ferb character i am not meant to view him like this
Bro I'm laughing so much I'm sweating as much Conan
Best ever ... He Sean'd Sean.  Totally threw him lol.
This is the hardest I’ve ever seen a guest take it 😂😂
This Has to be the best one ever. The best hot ones ever.😂😂😂😂
They say gingers have a higher pain tolerance, Conan may have just proved that
That just became my new favorite episode!! JUST A MASTERPIECE.
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
This episode cured my mental illness. Thank you!
Torille! 🎉
Conan is such a homie, he knew exactly what he was going to do for the season finale and ab-so-lutely CRUSHED!!
"call the wife" reminded me of Robin Williams
What an amazing mindfuck😂
Conan, you're my childhood. I miss watching you at midnight.  You were the highlight of my summer days, my dad was at work, so I could laugh freely. Thank you for making me laugh. I know he won't see this. I just needed to say it.
Noooooo!!!!!! Stop it, you haven't visited India yet!!!!!🥹
This makes up for the Ice spice ep
Yup, hot ones is done. Y'all had an incredible run. Big ups to Conan for being hands down the ultimate guest on the show! There were some good ones yet like many have or will say in these comments: ain't no one ever gonna top this. Insane
One of the best episodes yet
That was nuts. Does he no longer feel anything? Pepper must run in his blood stream.
Lol Conan, you're an animal.
lol im half way through and I KNOW conan is going down hard eventually.
God i love conan the energy he brings and the stories he tells are always amazing
Conan is easily the MVP of Hot Ones. No one has ever come CLOSE to this level or eaten this much hot sauce on the show. My god. Conan is one of the greatest performers of all time and he was in his element the whole time.
Yesssssssss finally
I was literally yelling through the screen when Conan was devouring da bomb 😩
Conan is a true entertainer and will always steal the show. A national treasure. Thank you for this episode, that no one will top.
Truly one of a kind, and the last of his kind. Conan is the GOAT.
Conan is a LEGEND and will henceforth be known as the Spice Lord! 😂❤😂
New favourite episode 😂
That's going to be some painful diarrhea
Conan came in hot and 110 committed! You go Conan! Usually Shaun would match the guest not this time with this crazy guest. lol
😂
The new king of best last dab!
Hands down one of the very best episodes ever
best one ever. facts. well done sir. you killed it!!!!
As an authentic, homegrown Max, I agree with Conan. The HBO rebrand has been a tough adjustment.
Best episode I've ever seen and it's not even close.
I knew this would be a good episode before I watched, but somehow it was even better than I expected! Hilarious and awesome!
okay but that was high energy if Ive ever seen some ahah
22:08 why does Conan shake when he eats 😭😭💀💀💀   Every time he eats he looks like he's seconds from combusting 😭
Conan is the best!
Now that's entertainment!!!!!
This is how you legend
Greatest episode by far
Man, I wish they still made them like Conan… one in a million ❤  Edit: and mad props for Sean for holding his own against this absolute legend!!
On the day of OJ’s passing… Norm would’ve been glad.
I hope Conan gets the chance to be interviewed that has nothing to deal with comedy. He's an intelligent guy, and you can tell that by what he references in his conversations.  Chaotic but intelligent.
Hands down the best episode.  I had no idea Conan could out-crazy Eric Andre.
Conan o Brian is truly one of kind human being!
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!!
Best episode ever
Nobody is going to top that.... 😂  Pure insanity and hilarity.  Conan killed
This is the top tier interviewing and comedy.
This is the top tier interviewing and comedy.
Best one yet
I didn't know this is what I was waiting for all my life!! Yeeeeeeeesssss Conan🎉🎉
Un.  Paralleled.
I was having a bad day, this cheered me up 😂
ATTENTION HOT ONES TEAM: Shut it down. You’ve peaked.
Unsurprisingly goat episode of hot ones. Perfect guest
Probably the best episode
I love how he complimented Sean on his serious interviewing, answered questions well, and also did everything possible to throw him off, lol. Master class guest, and probably cemented as the best episode.
Thank you Mr conan.... Thank you sean
Conan is insane. How??? How???
The best! Conan is hilarious! Love it
this is the best thing that ever happened
Ive been wanting him on the show for a while so thank you!
This is what I’ve been waiting for my whole life!! 😂
This was like watching a fight on Frontier Airlines. Hilarious!
I haven’t laughed this hard in a while. 😂 end this show now because there won’t be a better episode.
Conan really is one of the greatest
Conan kills it! i have been watching FirstWeFeast for years and Nambe Pabey guests taking little nibbles barely tasting the wings. Conan drinking and stuffing his pockets made an incredible bit of comedy genius!  This is on the top of the list here!
Love when you animate the stories
I love Conan! He's a legend!
Hahahahahaa I ended up crying.. What a showman!
What an absolute juggernaut of entertainment
Here's Lucy dye job not orange enough.
This episode is legend
Conan is the man
Most unhinged episode
By a long shot the greatest episode of all time
AN ALL-TIMER
I never thought that by the end of this season my eyes would be assaulted with the sight of Conan O'Brien frothing hot sauce, chicken, and milk out of his nose, eyes, and mouth.
Best hot ones episode ever.
Best ever! Conan is epic.
Best episode I have ever seen.
sean skipping the "i mirror my guests" line this time 🤣
No one will ever top this interview. Conan is a hot sauce GOLDEN GOD.
I’m so glad I wasn’t eating while watching this episode. Lol! Kudos to Conan for the commitment! 👏 He was totally in control from start to finish even though he spiraled into madness. I’ve never seen a Hot Ones guest like him. He’ll go down as one of the most memorable for me.
This is Coolio levels of self destruction 😂
We want matpat
a comedic legend
As Popeye said I am who I am! Commit to the bit! I mean, uhm.. commit to your role in life...maybe ..just maybe..break the mold given you and exit stage left to a new role that will lead you to greater things!
I mean look, I've been a Conan fan for 30ish years at this point so I went in with high hopes but SWEET JESUS, MARY, AND JOSEPH - the man brought a human comedy prop, was completely present the whole time, and basked in everything about Hot Ones.   A truly incredible and iconic performance.
Best Hot Ones yet! Ha ha.
Amazing 😂😢🎉
My man takes a final swig of the last dab. Conan is awesome! Also the fact that he has a heart to heart with Sean about his show and how much he likes it
Were there even any questions here? Every sauce was like an exponential dose of adrenaline for Conan. And he look like he was pepper sprayed at the end... and he kind of was.
was that worse than coolio?
THANKS FOR TODAYS LESSON MR. O'BRIAN
Conan is the smartest entertainment journalist kn the USA
God I always hoped I'd see Conan here eventually, such a legend.
Conan is always a good interview.
Call my wife😂😂😂
Best one of all time
Time to stop. We've done it. It's peaked.  This is show business.
What a treat. Fantastic.
CONAN IS A BEAST....... 😰
This about to be the goat of all interviews
Oh my god this was amazing 🤣
Conan never disappoints, such a great episode.
Conan was the last truly great Late Night host. He always cracks me up
A true peckerwood!
The absolute goat
Best one yet. Conan never disappoints.
Greatest “Hot Ones” ever!!!
Gotta luv Conan😅😅😅😅😅
Conan can't turn it off lol.   Conan the Barbarian   This is Conan the Legend
You’re not a doctor are you?  I should be😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conan just broke this show !!
what an interview !!! brilliant hahahaha
This is all the proof I need redheads have some genetic abnormalities
In true Conan/Simpsons style: BEST. EPISODE. EVER!
There is no topping this episode. Conan is the GOAT 🐐!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂
Conan is a monster lol
1:08 I need that as a gif
He's the greatest guest to ever appear on this show good lord
Two Goats
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!!!
What a great compliment!  You know that Sean is going to feast on that for a long time.
😂 he is visibly red
I wish I could keep watching this over and over for the first time. Peak entertainment. I love Conan so much.
Conan is a G
This is one of the few episodes where there is minimal cutting back to Sean. The editor allows us to revel in the glory that is Conan for the majority of the video. I also love that before Conan takes the buffoonery to the MAX, he makes sure to give Sean props for his skills as an interviewer. It's almost like saying, 'I'm about to do some dumb stuff, but I want you to know that you are great at your job.' This is the most I have laughed during any episode and with my favorite comedian ever. Incredible
Omfg 😂😂😂😂
Of course Conan gives the best Hot Ones performance of all time
This interview changed me
Looking forward to watching this. Does he substitute his string dance for a wing dance 🥹
Greatest Hot Ones of all time has dropped!
Why is Conan screaming at people only ever funny 😂
Will Conan be revisting Haiti on his show? You know since he loved the country so much after cheeto man insulted it as an s hole.
This man is a living LEGEND! So smart, so effortlessly hilarious! Amazing talent indeed.
Crying laughing while watching this 😂 Love this duo definitely mu favorite episode of Hot Ones yet! Get Jordan on there next!!
This maybe the best episode ever of Hot One's. Coco is the GOAT
The best episode of Hot Ones.
The Fear in shaun's eyes at 22:37 speaks volumes. Or it's sheer admiration, who knows!
April 18th is also my birthday
Conan really is an old school professional personality. We really don't get people like this anymore.
Still the best
Good way to recover from the BS that was Ice No-Spice.
GOATED
Sona's laugh in the background would be the golden touch
Conan forgot to prepare his body in various ways
Conan pulled a Homer and drank some candle wax backstage.
I wasn't expecting Conan to turn an interview into performance art but here we are.
Who knew Conan would be the most savage guest?!
😂😂😂😂😂
he was the best guest ever
This is the perfect level of crazy 😝
THIS MAN IS UNDEFEATED 🤣🤣🤣
This is a historic episode. absolutely unhinged amazingness
Conan is my hero. He is OUR hero.
The confused look of genuine horror and amusement on my face during the last half.
Put it on the Mount Rushmore of Hot Ones
😮 They should start classifying these hot sauces as a class A drug, but just for conan.
Ain't no way
Best interview ever.
Finally
omfg conan on this.......... life complete
This is great!!
THIS IS THE MOST UNHINGED EPISODE OF HOT ONES EVER! 🤣🤣🤣
I can’t comprehend how amazing this man is, legend forever!
We have a new undisputed best episode of Hot Ones.
The Best Hot Ones Ever
Funniest man on the planet. My favourite celebrity
Conan Needs a Friend....and a MEDIC!
Conan is the best!!
If Conan doesn’t top the charts for this, it’s rigged
This one's gonna be hard to top..conan is such a character..what a person!
Unbelievable, no one has ever destroyed those wings like Conan just did, he's licking and drinking the sauce like it's nothing while others like Terry Crews and Gordon Ramsay were struggling the entire time. What a legend.
I knew this was going to be one of the best and funniest episodes ever when I saw the thumbnail. Conan is the best talk show host ever and the level of commitment to his comedy acts is really impressive.
Legendary episode!!!!!
Conan got me through my depression ❤
This man is a national treasure. And I'm not even American.
Amazing Xoxoxox Conan rules!!!
Craziest episode ever.
he destroys himself lol
This is the best episode ever
I respect Conan for comitting to the bit.
ok...Conan did not disappoint.  It was the perfect level of overreacting.
Conan loves the world and we love him. Win win for everyone.
Conan O'Brien is an absolute legend. Watching this makes me regret not following his content more closely over the years.
"feel my pulse" " yeah, you have one" 😂
"So you are telling me this is pure pepper?" Best video on the internet.
Complete legend
UN. HINGED.  I love this so much.
Anyone notice that wrinkly green vain popping out right under his left eye.
The funniest talk show host ever.
God I love Conan
My new favorite guest.  Well worth the wait.  Conan is the GOAT, one of the truly good ones in an industry of fake and flimsy corrupted souls (but I already knew that)  No way Gordan Ramsey can top this and thats saying A LOT
HES 60??? BUT LOOKS 75😅
Taking commitment to the “bit” to legendary levels.
This is what happens when you invite professional showman into tv show. Best episode so far, well done!
That was epic!
This was so good 😂
who is the doctor???
Those sauces make me super hungry 😍 Conan as a quest shows how funny he is wihtouth trying to be funny
Conan shares a birthday with my son. Cool.
Sona and Gourley wouldn’t make it past Sauce Two.  So there’s that.
Is Conan alive? Just a worried fan. Thanks 🙏🏼
I question Conan ‘s Irish heritage
If you like this holler Yay
Conan is a freak'n beast he is the hot wing king.🤯
How can you top that? Conan O'Brien for President 2024!
The best
Conan is a savage! Top 10 episode easy, maybe top 5. Conan is one of the greatest comics of our time.
Yoooo, I’ve never laughed this hard during a hot ones in my life.
I laughed but man am I worried for Conan. Is he going to be okay?
When I saw Conan do that with Da Bomb: I was like, this is about to get real for him. That sauce is pure hate. I died laughing when he acknowledged his error.
CONAN IS A GOD!
"there's funny everywhere"  rules for life
This one is a Top 5 episode of all time
Conan never disappoints 🤣
If this isnt guest of the yr i am unsubing
Lol Conan has Rick’s “McDonald’s Szechaun sauce rant” energy throughout the whole interview
Conan is a monster hahahaha stay for the ending!!
I think the only guest that could out do this performance would be Sasha Baron Cohen.  And of course the guest we NEED is still The Rock.
Lol!
Conan supports Biden. Made me lose respect for him
Hot Ones wasnt this funny for a long time
Conan is an absolute manic lunatic 🤣
The best episode hands down 👏👏🤣🤣
This is my third comment already, I can't stop. I've never subscribed to this channel because I've just never been able to really connect with it before. I just have to now, for Conan, the GOAT.
6:47 I like how you can hear the crew when Conan mentions Bea Arthur lol
Bruh took a swig off the last dab.  Sean: "These are hot."  Conan: "Hold my last dab bottle."   Conan has always been the greatest host.
This was incredible
This is intense 😅😅😅😅
This is like the opposite of the DJ Khaled episode .
Shockingly great personality!  I had an Irish Catholic mother... she had a mind like a steel trap.  Anything she put her mind to, she could conquer.  I guess it's a Celtic characteristic.  Conan, you HAD to be in some pain, but managed to compliment, inform, and entertain.  This was one of, if not THE, best Hot Ones internal battles.  Will definitely be on the lookout for the MAX special "Conan O'Brien Must Go."
I love this man 😭🤣
Conan's shows are in their nature rooted in the time it aired. They look like they are from an era.  But are one of the most evergreen shows because the comedy is so great and rarely based on current events. What a great comedian
HE. IS. A. GOD!
GOAT
This is the best episode of hot ones I have ever seen. Conan GOAT
This was incredible
Haven't seen one second of this episode yet but it's already the best of all, ever !
Wildest episode yet! Loved it, love Conan O' Brien!
23:00 - Dumbledore said calmly.
Conan literally turns super human if he thinks one person will laugh. Well it worked. I laughed really hard!
Conan is the goat
Conan O Brien may have been the most powerful person to have been on the show
Oh man Conan's leg turned purple after that Buffalo incident 😲 That was on TBS 🤔 He showed the bruise on camera 😂
One of the greatest interviews ever. Conan is a comedic genius and a great historian of comedy. Amazing show.
who else had a huge smile when the " da bomb" came on the screen, just wondering uh oh, lets see him play this one off? haha
inhuman
2:00 vs 24:57  it's like watching a caterpillar become an unhinged manic butterfly. Utter perfection.
BEST EPISODE EVER
Conan won't survive another 4 years.
CONAN is and will always be the man. For him to have such a long career without a blemish is incredible.
I laughed so hard!!! Funniest one ever!!!
2 men 10 bottles
This man is the GOAT
Conan is the man!!!
Conan's dry cleaner be like 'oh no, not this s%@# again.'
Conan is crazy 😝!!!  Respect 🫡 🌶️🔥
23:01  This is where the mad scientist shrieks "You fools wouldn't understand! I am becoming something beautiful!"
Conan will forever be the goat 😂😂
23:00 definitely something someone who is perfectly fine would say 😂😂
Conan is a beast
Hands down funniest episode ever. 😂
The Greatest Season ending with THE G. O. A. T.   , R. E. S. P E. C. T. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Christ. You knew this one was gonna go off the rails. Conan is that guy.
Conan's got one giant head!!!
This is the first episode I've watched from start to finish. Love you Conan.
I’ve known him as en epic eater but today he blew hearts and minds 😂
This is up there with the Dave Grohl episode as one of my top episodes
This must be my favourite episode of all time!
500k in 5 hours sheeesh
I kind of wish Dr. Arroyo was a real doctor ☠️
I don't think I've ever laughed this hard at an episode 🤣🥕
Buy bottle number nine Conan O’Brien had transcended into Robin Williams 😂😂😂😂
Best episode EVER and even introduced the ‘wing drop’ to the Hot Ones lore. It had to be Conan O’Brien!
Conan is a perfect example of "do it. It'll be funny!"
KEDAKAI! As god made her
Conan is the GOAT… 😂😂😂
23:00 to 25:30 is like watching Rick and Morty merged with the Apparently kid on acid.
This cannot be beaten. Conan is the GOAT
Seeing this got a VERY audible, “Oh HELLO yeah” from me this evening lol
Best Hot Ones EVER!
I take it he can't feel pain!
Best hot ones episode ever
He is amazing
Conan is the single Greatest Human alive
I can't believe how charismatic Conan is
He went hard in that sauce! What a performer.
I'm gonna watch his show 100,000,000% :)
Best Episode Ever!!! 💀
The number of times I gasped aloud during this interview.  Conan sacrifices his body for this interview in as many ways as he can think of.
The best episode ive seen
I thought it was CINAMAX?  Boomer checks in 😳
Wow Conan wow , excellentness 🍻
best episode ever!
Well technically this isn’t a game, but Conan won somehow anyway.
That was both disgusting and hilarious. 😂🤮
This is hands down the best episode of Hot Ones I've ever seen.
Funny how they re-animated the buffalo episode.
Conan understood the assignment.
I thought Conan wasnt ready for the show but ooh boy was i wrong. the show was not ready for him.
In a comedic league of his own
Ultimate guest, ty Sean, waiting for this only 🥰
2:30 in and its already one of my favorites
My hero 😂.
My stomach hurts so bad from laughing. Living legend!!
Conan is a legend!
Legend
Awesome 😂
Conan is a madman 👍
true showman
He'll be knocked out for a day and a half drinking tankards of pepto on a hotel toilet seat
I think Conan had a mental break in the last third of the video HAHAHAHAHAHA
This was incredible
I was fully expecting Conan to start rubbing that sauce directly into his eyeballs.
Someone needs a napkin!
You will never have a better episode. This was peak Hot Ones
The most incredible display of sheer will I have ever seen
Wow all I can say is wow
I would take Conan over any light night show host any day.
“There’s comedy in Old Testament, there’s comedy in the New Testament” -Conan O’Brien
Jesus Conan 🤣
This is what almost 30 years of showbusiness looks like. One of the absolute best guests ever.
Such a legend. Thank you for being Conan
1000x better than ice spice
Conan O'Brien can cut through the Wings of Death like he was tasting the wings of Beth! The shadow of death has nothing upon the the god of vanilla. Which might not be for those of the darkest aspects but Conan can expand his range to reach even your aspects!
There you have it, Conan won Hot Ones
This has to be the greatest episode 😂😂😂
I need a jacket ID.
Im proud of both of you Sean and Conan. You both are awesome
💜💜
I love me some Conan. The way he manhandled the BOMB....whoa. Didn't even flinch!
16:55 His William Shatner impression.
Happy Birthday Conan, can't wait for April 18🥳🎂🎁💝
Good LORD that was funny!!! 🤣
they are like two opposite sides of an Irish coin
GLORIA!!
Good god!
jesus, this is my favore guest after all 23 seasons. what a trooper. man a truly great showman.
absolutely fantastic
This is the best episode ever!
Conan should be crowned the G.O.A.T. of Hot Ones
Didn't Bill Burr use to say it wasn't going well?
Of all the great shows on this channel this has to be one of the best
I have always liked Conan. But the way he was acting came across like a former tv host who is now irrelevant and is majorly overcompensating for it.
This is the single greatest episode of this show I've ever seen 😂🔥 Conan is legendary for this
Best guest ever
This will go on to be the best finale and will be the greatest of all time!
Best Hot Ones ever.  Thank you, Conan.
This is the most beautifully unhinged episode of hot ones. Might just go down as one of the greatest interviews there has ever been.
Hes a mess 😂😂😂😂
Never whatch Conan thought I would like this proved wrong again hot ones
I’m like “oh shiiiiiiij” when da bomb moment happened
He somehow mad Eric Andre's interview look tame
This was a great one
When he started doing that with “Da Bomb” we knew he was done.
I think Conan broke hot ones lol epic guest. They was he took on the wings...hat of to the  new hot wing champ Conan 🏆🎉
there is no instance in which I will ever not love Conan. What. A. Living. Legend. i was crying tears at the end
Pocketing the wings is somehow way more hilarious than it should be. Why Conan? Just why? And I'm not sure about the Doctor. lol But this was brilliant. Well done Sean.
WOW.  This is legendary!  This will go down as one of THE best Hot Ones interview.
Oh man. Hats off. Absolutely phenomenal episode. Fantastic work Conan and the team here.
I’ve never laughed harder while also being impressed and scared before
Yes!  This is the hot ones we needed.  Conan is such a legend.  Good job team!
I haven’t laughed so hard in a long time
He broke the mold!
This has been single-handedly my favorite episode by far. What a savage!!!
As I'm watching this beautiful catastrophe unfold I can't help but feel like if anyone was ever going to die from eating too much hot sauce, it's about to be Conan O'Brien.
I love Conan 😂😂
Way better than I expected
Bro turned into Garry Shandling and Lewis Black's lovechild by the end there
The CONAN IS BACK!!!
Best episode ever
This is the last episode of the show right? There is no way anyone can top this, so you're quitting now, right?
In his own unique way, Conan "beat" Hot Ones. Sean absolutely did a fantastic job as well. I can't imagine its easy to impress Conan with your interview skills. But Sean did.
Hands down one of the best Hot Ones episodes ever! an absolutely incredible piece of entertainment 🔥🔥🔥. Sean was delightfully as always but Conan stole the show 👏🏽
He's a real life Chandler Bing
🤯 This is the collaboration I *NEEDED* in my life! 🐓
More proof that Conan is one of the funniest people of all time.
Happy Birthday Conan, can't wait April 18th 🥳🎂🎁💝
Iconic!!!
Best episode ever. Conan is the GOAT
Irish terminator ☘️
RIP Conan. Absolutely hilarious
Conan is the greatest talkshow host of all time, he is so flawlessly funny
Conan is a true comedy pro. Always with the golden gags  sharpe sketches. This man is a fckin Legend!❤
What a legend 😂
That was Incredible!  great work Sean and great work Conan!   💙
I had such anxiety for Sean trying to match the guest this week...🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
best ever
Wow always watch this but this has to be my favorite episode yet.
17:00-18:00 is hilarious hahahaha
I like how Dr. Arroyo kinda looks like Jordan
Dude the best episodes of all time❤
THIS IS THE GREATEST HOT ONES EPISODE OF ALL TIME!!
We used to wonder who had given the greatest hot wing eating performance ever. Conan just ended all conversation. That was absolutely in a league of its own.
Best episode ever
Is conan okay?
Conan is the perfect kind of unhinged.
Conan is a stone cold spice killer
conan is genius
Absolutely incredible
It’s not that his family didn’t season their food, he was just born literally without taste buds.
Finallyyy, best episode
I feel like robin Williams would of acted this exact same way
Conan straight bringing the joker vibes. What a beast!
What an absolute legend!   That’s my talk show GOAT!
By far funniest episode!
FINALLY ... somebody truly famous on Hot Ones.
He's like 90's Jim Carrey and Robin Williams had a baby. Late night comedy hosts ended when he retired from it. After that they have just been awful. Conan and Leno all the way baby.
Ok. I want what Conan is having but only half of the dosage.
Best one yet!
17mins after filmin Conan Sadly Passed Away 😔
What a legend 👏
Conan putting bones in his pocket is on brand
What a laugh. I love this one!!! Legendary
Long Live The KIng!!
Conan is a legend…  ❤
this is why I have so much love and respect for Conan. A one of a kind master at his craft.
Conan turned into Lewis Black by the end.
i love this man so much
Conan is an absolute legend.
I would hate to be the next guest after this.
WOW! JUST WOW! THE NEW LEGEND! As Always, May God Bless you and yours! 😇
I never really comment on stuff, but this was exceptional.
for the love of GOD Please have him back 🤣
I will cherish this for the rest of my days
This was absolutely unhinged, and we are here for it!!!
Instant classic. 🤣🤣🙏
😅😅😅😅😅😂
Conan is the man!
Already love Conan, but watching him decimate the wing challenge was amongst the best things I've ever seen in my life. The Sistine Chapel, sunrise beach view in Fiji and the Grand Canyon, underwhelming in comparison.
LOVW TOU CONANC THANK YOUF RO MAKING MY DREAMS COM3 RTRUE
To this day I still love Conan. For the people.
You can't predict the future, as a guy growing up in a Dallas, TX hood, I never would've believed I would be a Conan O'Brien fan, or watch Everyone loves Raymond. Who would've fuqin thought 💯. Wish I could meet this guy someday.
I just LOVE Conan!
I remember the episode he showed his hip bruise to the audience. Catcalls of "WOO TAKE IT OFF" immediately followed by gasps of horror.
Dudes, we just witnessed history in the making. This episode has some of the greatest Hot Ones moments of all time. Hands down.
Conan is the best
epic
Conan O'Brien, the GOAT.  One of the most loved celebrities of all time
One of my favorite famous people in the world
I assume he coated his mouth in wax before he went on
Holy Chaos
wow the hot ones crew gets Conan clearance but not Larry David????
WHAT A MANIAC
i feel at times during this interview Sean was genuinely scared 😂
No doubt the funniest hot ones I've seen
Epic
Great guest
This is my favorite Hot Ones episode and it's not even close. Conan's the best.
“He who controls the spice controls the universe.” Slow clap. 👏
Amazing show. Conan is definitely going through it at the end😭
Saying this is the Charlie Rose show with hot wings is 💯 the highest compliment imaginable! I concur! Just out here Killin It.
Oh my dear heavens!!??   ..kindda get the TWO tables now! It wasn't COVID+! IT WAS CONAN ♥ PS. The 60s = the new being überStupid 20s!
Oh god lol
I cried laughing watching this episode! Conan is hilarious! 🤣🤣🤣
Incredible!🎉🎉
I yelled “ NOOOOO” when he started to drink the sauce. I’m still watching.. I’m so scared yet, highly entertained
I love this guy
One of If not the Best Hot Ones Ever! 👌
Im loving all the love for Conan! His podcast is just comedic gold got all those who havent given it a go
I think the Pepper X people need to get in touch with Conan so he can help them come up with a pepper that he can take seriously.
He did everything short of bathing in the hottest sauces.  I did not see that coming.  He is the new Spice Lord!  🤯
Oh I have the same bday as Conan lol
Why can't I give this 10 likes at once?
Sweet, Tarja Halonen is on hot ones.
He had me at the Napoleon Dynamite putting the wings in his pocket bit.
Are you a doctor? I'm supposed to be.. lol!!
The shot of the hot sauce slowly spilling onto the table while Conan is giving his lecture/rant/speech/plug was perfect.
This might just be the best episode ever.   Conan is truly a hot one.  Ice spice really should watch this and take notes.
The show i always wanted. Now let's see how it goes
Conan is so real and honest and funny. God, this is such a great episode, including the fake doctor. Hilarious as always. LOVE Conan!
How does any guest follow that up? Best hot ones episode by far, Conan is a living legend truly.   This performance reminded me of what Chris Farley would have been like if he lived long enough to do an episode.   Bravo Conan!
You said last episode with Shakira was finale☕️
You kiggt as well end the show now. It will never get better than this unless Gordon and Conan do a crossover episode.
Point blank: GREATEST THING I'VE EVER WATCHED!!!
We definitely have a candidate for “best” guest of all time, no joking around! I was laughing hard while wanting to throw up. This was brilliant stuff. Long live Sean, Conan, and Hot Ones!
Best guest in hot ones history.
I AUDIBLY GASPED THE MILLISECOND I SAW THIS. I HAVE BEEN DREAMING OF THIS. I'M SO EXCITEDDDDD!!!!!!
TWO ECLIPSES IN 1 WEEK LET'S GOOOOOOOO
Sona and Matt next!!!
Oh my. I was NOT prepared 😂
Conan’s gift to hot ones is to give everything! It comes with love and it is well deserved.
The legend is an absolute machine!
Jesus Ti******ing Christ that was literal insanity. Legendary isn't even the word.
This guy has done it all. No fear.
Conan is the best!
This is the first time a guest has outshined sean’s brilliance. What an amazing episode. Thanks conebone69!
Conan Just Won Hot Ones!! GAME OVER!!!!
This was friggin' unhinged, and I loved every second of it,
This has to be one of the best, and most chaotic episodes. Conan handled those wings way better than anyone thought he would.
Conan is the goat.
this is the funniest episode I've seen!! Conan is not only a boss with the sauces HAHA but he's funny AF!!!! Good job hot ones and Sean!
And this is why we love Conan! 🙏🙇‍♂
Conan is a true comedian at heart. He’s not just a funny guy. He’s a funny guy that wants to make you laugh and feel good.
Conan is an absolute unit!
Best Episode Yet!!! Good luck beating this one...😂
It's amazing he didn't burst into flames
This is a textbook example of, “they had us in the first half ngl”
Conan is insane, he’s on another level
i never forgave him for what he did to Terrance and Phillip
The hot sauce turned Conan into Roger Rabbit
Conan wins, y'all
He must have eaten those berries that make things sweet before he came on. lol his body is reacting but not him
Sauce around his mouth like a toddler. Ok. But with hot sauce? Hilarious.
Canceling Conan on Late Night. HUGE MISTAKE.  YOU TV EXCUTIVE IDIOTS.
Sean had ZERO idea what to even do with him 😅
This is a demonstration of a shear professionalism and will.
wow what a finally.  just wow. Conan really coming thru with the wing drop!
"Check for my pulse" "It's there" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I've been watching since the beginning and have seen every single episode (some multiple times) and this.. this is easily the best one yet! WOW! so good!
I demand you add Conan to the party next time you and chili Klaus decide to eat a straight up Reaper pepper!
"My mission is you to learn nothing about the country, and my job is that you know less about the country when im done" now this has to be the most absurd but entertaining idea for a travel show, its a real f u to the genre and its hilarious. In comedy no one should have imunity, every one has to be made fun of equally so this show idea is very true to comedy standards
I always think I know how Conan will act, then he completely blows me away with how wrong I was! 🤣 Conan you are a treasure.
Best guest ever PERIOD
I love Conan. I loved this episode. Almost had an anxiety attack when Conan started drinking the sauce, hope he is well. My favorite quote: "Call the wife!!!!!"
I haven't laughed this hard since Kevin Hart. Best interview ever! Great content! Thanks to Conan for going all in!
Conan is always comedic platinum!!! I will be watching his new show for sure!
Love me some Coco! ❤
👏👏👏👏👏👏   all that needed to be said.
Conan is the EFFFFing KING
Conan's face getting so red that the sauce looks light 😂
Actor, singers, athletes, etc. yeah, yeah, yeah. I’ll take this type of entertainment and fun any day of the week! Team Coco 4 life!!!
23:30 Conan gives a brief Havard level lecture on comedy itself while being incredibly funny while also slowly descending into madness while also somehow keeping his composer while also being fully professional.   He's a living legend for a reason.
Such a perfect way to end the season! 😂😂
Huge credit to Sean for always keeping up with whoever he's interviewing. You want to add more. He will add more.
Best hot ones ever!😁👍🤪🥰
This is 100% unadulterated , uncut pure comedic gold. Brilliant. Conan is a genius madman. Sean, you sir are incredible. Well done. Thanks for this.
Conan O’Brian is amazing
Have to say probably the best episode ever.  Love you Conan
I knew this would be Hot Ones' best one the moment I saw the thumbnail.
I have always had a crush on conan
That was a legenday last dab!
the best show on YT right now..
"He has an office in the desert" just about killed me 😂😂😂 🙋🏻‍♀️from the coachella valley and Conan isnt too far off with that 🤣
That was wild.
My stomach hurts from laughing 😂😂😂
Only Conan could take over the interview the way he did
That was crazy!
HE WHO CONTROLS THE SPICE CONTROLS THE UNIVERSE
That was the most unhinged yet professional episode yet.. how do you top that? 😂
conan is insane for bathing the wings with the sauce, he's the goat for real. i loved his travel episodes, i can't wait for the new ones. i want to see his shenanigans in thailand doing muay thai 😂
20:58 💀
by far the funniest show ever...amazing Conan!
He is off the rails. Great show
Just EPIC!
"I think that's just cause you're meeting your idol" cracked me up
Conan's hair must be protected at all costs.
This just might be the best episode of the series.
Legend
Conan's face when they tell him the cameras didnt get any of that footage☠️☠️
Unironically the best guest ever, Conan is a true showman!
This is everything I could've wanted and more out of a Coan episode. So beyond happy Conan finally made it onto the show
High on pepper is tight 😂
The definition of Commit to the Bit.  Absofreakinlutely insane.
This was seriously the best episode.  I will watch his show
I mean, end the show here, Conan just won, sorry Sean but this is the pinnacle. You had a great run.
This is the most legendary episode of the hot ones. G.O.A.T🙌
My belly’s upset just from watching Conan do what he did!  It would have been hilarious to see him take on some Pepto Bismol the same way he did those sauces.
He is absolutely nuts!!!
Insane 😂😂😂
I'm here for the subtle Jay Leno shade.  "the other guy..." 😂😂
That's the maddest Hot Ones interview ever 🤣Loved every second.  Conan is a riot, powered by hot wings!  Sean was brilliant too.
I've never been happier to see someone on this show.
Conan takes the cake. This man wasn't fazed at all for someone who doesn't do hot food. First person I've seen drinking the hot sauce and last dabbing Da Bomb
He brought his own freaking skit. Truly show how special this man is as comedian and entertainer
Quite possibly the best Conan Conan's ever Conaned!
This will be right up there with Gordon Ramsay..  Thank you so much Sean and Hot Ones
This is the craziest Hot Ones ever and this is why I’ve always loved Conan. He is a comedy genius and anything he touches is gold! I absolutely loved watching this! All 27 minutes 😂😂😂
Obsessed 😂 just love this
Schooled and mic dropped 🫳 👏
Sean just gave up trying to interview him by the end, he was just along for the ride
Been watching a while, and this is gut busting funny thank you @Conan and @Sean
I love Conan 😭
He's really in another level. The commitment. Comedy God. 🤌
Conan understood the assignment and excelled
What. A. BEASSSTTTT!!!!!!!!!
Best guest ever!
No door left on the frame, completely unhinged
Fear and loathing  on hot ones !
LEGEND
Amazing episode!   Now we need Chris Evans
Best episode by miles
Conan is #1 after this
Better than snow in the '80s, i presume 😲
Conan’s the man
This is so great, legendary
- What did Da Bomb find beyond insanity? . . . . . - Conan O'Brien.
After the last wing, Sean was genuinely scared of what Conan might do next.
What a beast
I used to pray for times like this
Absolute soldier.
This is the funniest interview I’ve ever seen. Love Conan man 😂
GREATEST COMEDIAN THAT WE EVER HAD
It's always The Bomb
Anyone know what denim jacket Conan is wearing?
I am lost for words.  This was my favourite episode.
David Blaine had no reaction during his show.  However, Conan is splattering sauce all over the place and going nuts.  Hilarious.  He knew exactly what he was going to do.  Sean panicking that he wasn’t going to be able to keep up was great.
Conan’s face (and hands) matching his hair by the end.  There needs to be a CONAN sauce after this. 🐐
I always thought the King Cobra was the worst animal act.  It might have been defanged.  Did it get loose live on TV?  Also the crocodile they brought on stage.  It wasn't toothless and could have attacked anyone at any time.  Please support Ukraine!!! Comedians shouldn't have to fight superpowers!
Now, that's how it's done! One of the best episodes ever. What a legend.
Best episode ever! Conan is a beast!!
Conaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan!!!! YESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!
This gave Conan the swollen lips he's longed for his entire life 😂😂
What a Legend! He put in 200% effort for this show and it was good.
Eeeeeeek. It finally happened
This might be a worthy successor to the *iconic* Gordon Ramsey episode.
Is he still all triggered over Trump. Hahaha.    The only good thing he has done was. When he had norm on his show. And norm would just mess with Conan and the crowd.
He is not human. I don't think anyone is going to do this ever again.
Conan is one In a billion
I love Conan’s humor. It just blended perfectly into the Hot Ones format. The only thing wrong with this episode is that it took so long to happen.
This was amazing!
Can we please get Craig Ferguson on Hot Ones!!
Best episode ever for me. Huge
Did Conan prep for this interview by drinking candlewax?? That was insane! Complete madness!
That could be the greatest Hot Ones episode of all time laughi😂😅
Conan is indeed the hot one.
aaand we've just witnessed the beginning of Conan's hot sauce addiction.... LOL!
Conan ALWAYS delivers.
Very likeable man
Conan O'Brien, beyond insanity.
WORLDS ARE COLLIDING
Wow, that was impressive. Good make up was annoying though... looked like a clown. He was soooo red, and his eyes got bloodshot. Talk about control! Wow!
F**king epic. Oh my Conan O’Brian!
Conan wearing hot sauce lipstick
Conan was and is my favorite. Smartest of the entire bunch, for sure.
conan just topped the eric andre and gordon episode like that
This was EVERYTHING I hoped it would be and more. That’s gold Jerry! Gold!
Best episode in the history of Hot Ones!
Connan as famous as he is I still think it's underrated
Conando!!!   Consiewonsie!!! Team coco   killed it!!!!
Gosh, what a legend
Commitment
Prob one of the best finales ever! LOL LOVE the sauce all over the face! the best! haha
Eating lunch while watching this was a bad idea. I almost choked a few times from laughing so hard!
Only Conan would put the bones in his pocket. Smfh lol
Conan completely beasted those wings. This was the complete opposite of DJ Khaled.
Da Bomb is afraid of this man.
The best hot ones... evee
Please do release a Director's cut of this one day soon, with pre and post commentary.
Literally sent my kids upstairs to watch this. What a dream come true
Instant Classic!!
Love Conan💌
what an absolute legend.  i love conan
Conan is the best who ever done it on this show.
This was perfect 😂
OH MY GOD hahahaha best hot ones episodes EVER.
27 minutes? What did you do to him?
that was incredible
I've never seen conans face so red, legit thought the veins in his head were gonna pop 😭😭😂
That toilet doesn't deserve what it's about to get
I now realize why Conan is the most respected host of late night talk shows.
If you don’t understand Conan you definitely won’t find this funny
I've watched a lot of Conan. I wasn't expecting this.. legend.
This guy is a comedy genius
I haven’t cried while laughing so hard in a long time. Cheers to all involved! Thank you!
I can see some new Conan gifs being created from this. Lol
Conan O'Brien  is an American treasure that we need to protect at all cost!!!!
Conan’s gotta be introduced to Smokin Ed and Pepper Klaus
Nothing but respect for Mr. O'Brien.
dude is rick Sanchez in real life
Dr arroyo lol
I was so worried for him at first and now I'm scared to death of him.
I had high expectations… they were surpassed. Thanks Conan
amazing. my fav episode. everyone else are PHONIES!!
CONAN RULES. wow that was an awesome show, congrats sean.
the GOAT
conan legend
He raised the bar with this one. Legend!
born showman
Conan is an absolute LEGEND. This was incredible to watch, and I'll watch it again and again.
I cannot believe what i saw. Conan is the effing GOAT   I laughed soo hard
I’m crying in laughter jeez
Went to one of the Conan shows around '09 and had a great time. He came out before the show, talked to a couple people, made some jokes. This was probably his 2000+ show and he really made it a fun event for everyone. You could never convince me he's a bad guy.
i laughed, i liked 😂
My prayers have been answered! Hallelujah!
Final episode of hot ones! Wrap the show conan is the GOAT!
This is kinda like iZombie.
funniest episode ever ! well done Conan!
The goat 🐐 Conan
Conan murdered the sauces....literally every hot sauce was bleeding in the end!!!
Havent even watched yet and I know this is gonna be a fire episode
Has anybody checked on Conan? He still alive?
What a beast!! Conan... 🙌
Face changes color and can't hear words im just starting to feel it.
Conan fears NOTHING.    He has no sense of shame, or concern, about “results”.    He simply commits, fully and passionately, to his process of comedy, and he utterly trusts his co-performers.    So, so amazing.
FANTASTIC !!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Conan nailed it.
It's over. Stop filming. This was it.
One of the best Hot One's yet!
CALL THE WIFE! Conan at his best!!!
Hi Conan, I know you read through these comments to find something negative
WOOOOO!
Getting one of the pillars of late night television right there on set. What an opportunity.
This is the greatest hot ones episode by far what an animal
Does Conan have some kind of genetic mutation that stops him from feeling capsaicin?
april 4th was my birthday, but this episode of hot ones was the best b-day gift evah! Love Conan Obrien, been watching his show forever, wish he'd go back to his late night's roots but guess I'll need to catch him on his new stuff.
Truly the GOAT
Best episode ever.
This is show business excellence. Also, it’s the first time I remember Sean looking at the guest with deep genuine fear. Top 5.
What a hero. Arguably an insane, deranged psychopath who probably turned their insides into soft-serve, but undeniably a hero.
I feel lucky to be around at the same time as Conan O’Brien. Not only a true talent, but you can just tell he is genuine and a good person.
*This was fan-f'n-tastic!*
The best episode ever, Conan set the bar rly high. it will be nearly impossible to top thatin both comedy and courage. unbelievable!
O' Brien took this to a whole new level 👏 👏...
Conan eats spicy wigs. That's JUST what I needed today! 🧡
the shear terror on Sean's face lol 22:39
Conan went full Chris Farley on this one!
the wardrove department seeing this.... 💀💀💀
WOW conan is a beast dude
I sincerely hope this get la everyone to check out Conan O Brian needs a friend podcast 😂😂😂
One of the few times ive watched the entire episode 😂
This has to be the best finale ever :) well done 😊
lol laid heavy into the charlie charplin speech hehe
23:00 is gonna be a meme for sure. Conan is an absolute legend
HANDS DOWN THE BEST EPISODE EVER ON HOT ONES.The GOAT
I absolutely love how it tracks that every guest appearance Conan does he takes control. Sean cannot match the energy levels Conan is putting out. You'd think since he's been a talk show host he'd maybe lean towards having the back and forth but no, he's on the absolute opposite and becomes a one man show. Amazing.
Probably the best anchor to round out the season you could've picked
best episode ever
Epic beyond any of my expectations.
The greatest living comedian 😁
He’s not real wow
can I just say, anyone who's been watching conan for years knows he's got that Irish genetic dogdy digestive system, dang he gon be in paaaain later 😭🤣 talk about burning ring of fire 😭🔥🤣 mans gonna have to book the next three days off 💀😭😂
that was epic <3
21:15 Chris Farley came down and possessed this man
I forgot how much I loved Conan, this had me literally LOL.
Hit that like button if you like Conan!!!
YES!
Algorithm buster
Wow 😂😂😂😂
I thought this was going to be one of the best of all time and it surpassed my expectations. Conan is simultaneously equal parts hilarious, highly intelligent, and pure psychosis
Conan is simply the best to ever do this.
❤❤❤ Conan!!!  Legend!
Best show ever- Conan channelling some Rapaport Bravado, so many funny moments!
that table took a beat down 13/10!
This was the most disturbing conversation over food on TV since "The Bear's" Christmas dinner episode. Conan is the Hot Wings GOAT!
Huge Conan fan this was such an amazing episode. Got to meet him at one of his shows after we got married he came up into the stands on a commercial break and talked to us was so nice and funny. I really liked his answer about worst thing a guest can do because it showed what a serious professional he is under the goofy crazy persona.  Licking Da Bomb as the most terrifying thing I've ever seen.
That's gotta come out too, bud
We need to see what happens to him after the show lol😂
Made all the other guests look so weak 😅
I just loved this whole video....  that buffalo story is sad... his final advice is lit... amazing.... ❤❤❤❤❤
I haven’t cried laughing so hard in my life… can I hire Dr Arroyo?
How long did he practice for this?? 😂
Best guest ever!
All the potatoes must have done something to the taste buds.  How did other guests with Irish genetics fare?
CRAZY that this man and this interview exists in the same universe where Ice Spice's interview came out just two weeks prior. Couldn't happen on any other show.
Transcendent
Conan is the GOAT.
This is one of if not the best episode ever!
This is one of the best  episodes.
HE PWND DA BOMB
Conan is the G.O.A.T. 🔥
"Even the most potent spice will have no effect on him"  It is as written!  *He is Lisan Al Gaib!*
Conan here reminded me of the old school wrestlers (some of whom have guested here, like the Undertaker or Steve Austin) who endure and ignore pain and injury in service of the character and the show. Just amazing stuff, makes me feel Conan missed the regular platform to be oddball bonkers. This really could be a series finale and not just a season ender. Very happy for you all at Hot Ones! Enjoy the break, take an extra two weeks off everyone!
We all noticed how good a interviewer he is that’s what the best part
He is the best.
Conan I love ya, but that jacket is terrible my man
how much drugs did he take before this shoot
Will love conan till I die
😎👍
this was so nerve wrecking to watch.
The GOAT episode.
Incredible 🥳
Conan's energy as a guest is unmatched. It felt like two interview legends going toe to toe in convo rather than interviewer and interviewee. This episode was absolutely legendary
The doctor putting the half eaten wing in his pocket without hesitation killed me😂
My jaw is on the floor.   Please Conan don't throw a bottle of hot sauce in there.
He’s got to be toughing this out with seemingly inhuman ability in an attempt to shore up his legacy. Right?
16:45 and the award of most aggressive consumption of the bomb for all time would goes to Conan O'Brien
Conan is a born showman who will do almost anything to make people laugh.  People like that are a treasure.
This is the worst person I have ever seen on the show. Who is this?
Conan turned into Daniel day Lewis at the end there 😂
This the peak. This is it. The 🐐
Easy top 5 best episodes ever!
Absolute Electric Factory
The GooooaT the Gooooooooooat
This was absolutely amazing 🤣🤣
This tall Dutch woman is insane
Why is Conan dressed like a 1970s stop motion puppet?
That cant be actual hot sauce in those bottles...
Considering Conan's 193 cm tall, and Sean looks the same height sitting opposite him. Conan must be crouching in the seat, or his chair is lowered, or maybe both. Because he always towers over people, no matter if he's standing or sitting down.
My favorite episode ever...Conan is a legend and handled those wings like a CHAMP! gonna be hard to beat this one
I thought ive seen the best hot ones  guest eat those wings. But this vato right here just efen killed it.conan, you are the mothafokka meng.
Why is he popular? Name his best stand-up?
Manifesting works 🥰🥳
I laughed every time he put a piece in his pocket
I've literally no idea who Conan Obrien is. But I think he has issues.
One of the best hings I have seen in a while!!!    I was laughing out loud.   Which is fine but I was at work, not working so hard LOL
King Conan!!!!!
.... i'm just........ can't answer question , talk about himself , don't listen to other ......
hes crazy  😮
If there was ever any doubt about Conan being a comedy genius, that doubt was taken out behind a shed and violently disposed of. Best episode ever XD
What a legend. Conan is like a king who still fights his own battles in the warfield. Very inspiring to see someone in his position still give it a 120% like hes a rookie looking to make a name for himself.
Conan is a true showman.
Like him or dislike his comedy, his commitment is off the charts. Way to plug a show. 😂
OH.. MY... GOD!!!! HAHAHAHAHA!!!
I remember being so uncomfortable when Steve-O poured hot sauce in his eye thinking it couldn’t possibly get more daring or epic. Leave it to Conan to dwarf that episode in entertainment value and legendary moments. Definitely as entertaining as this show can get. The comments are not a disappointment either.
A Charlie Rose show where you eat hot wings 🤣
the first person to upstage Sean Evans
This was disgusting 🤢
Conan is a national treasure and best guest you've ever had
I haven't laughed like this in a very long time 😭😂
CONAN KILLED IT....... NO WORDS..... GAVE HIS UTMOST BESTTTTT..... ❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Been waiting for this one for a long time
Adding extra da bomb sauce is legendary status.
THIS. IS. IT.  GOLD
Seeing all of Conan's hot sauce bottles toppled over on the table at the end was a beautiful sight to behold. Compared to Conan, NO MAN is a better Showman!
I legit screamed out loud when he started pouring the sauce on da bomb
I can already see the memes coming from this episode alone 😂😂
Shut it down, the show's over. There will never be a better Episode.
I'm disappointed in you Sean, you usually match the guest. Where was the added sauce of the bomb???? Or the hot sauce shot???
Best show ever, great interview and great seen Connan, best thing he did for us was leaving the show and being himself
Team Coco!!! Represent!!!
GOAT
Love how Conan doesnt realize that the sauces are all in order sitting in front of him - the first 4 wings he keeps asking "What is this?
I actually had to watch this twice back to back 😅because it was amazing!
Half a million views in under 5hrs.  That's cooking FWF!
That was glorious
"Your not a doctor are you?" " I should be." That made me belt out laughing.
Bring in Caitlin Clark or Angel Reese
Mad unhinged
THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER EPISODE LIKE THIS ONE!
ONE OF THE BEST EPISODES OF ALL TIME ❤ ERIC ANDRE EAT YOUR HEART OUT !!!!!!!
This is the first time I've seen Sean loosing the control over the interview. Conan went full Conan here.
Absolute Chaotic Gold! Conan never disappoints
This is the best episode so far, what a legend
What an amazing episode.
I was thinking it was a rouse by Conan…while patiently waiting for him to get to Da Bomb!  I have that sauce and it is NO JOKE!!!  He did not disappoint!  😂😂😂
🙌🙌🙌😆so excited for Conan
Incredible.
LOL Conan is the best!
This episode is up there with Sterling K. Browns as being f'n classic! 😂
Yes yes  Conan Conan Conan 🎉
best guest ever
Seeing a greater interviewer and personality against Sean really just shows where Sean’s skills are. Like fr almost purely questions what a great conversation.
Conan was a fantastic season finale ❤  Next season Sean, can you try to get Flula Borg on the show? He would be so entertaining to watch and interact with!!!! Just a thought 🤔
He absolutely insane!! And I’m hear for all of it. Never seen anyone handle it like this!
THIS HAS TO BE THE MOST IMPRESSIVE INTERVIEW IN ALL OF  FIRST WE FEAST!!!
A lot of cringy things came out of the 90's. Conan is not one of those. this man one gets funnier.
What a great interview. My favorite to date!
Conan has been making me laugh for more years than I want to admit, but I think the ending of this episode is the hardest he's ever made me lose it
Holy F$&@!! HES A LEGEND!!
Having Ice spice be one of the most boring interviews to this is such a monumental transition
Highlarious. Conan never disappoints.
😂WACK'O👍
Ed Currie would be so proud of Conan!
Best guest ever😂😂
this was so unhinged
u simply have to love Conan, this man is a legend. Much love from Rwanda !!!!!!
Conan O' Brian is so much better than Seth meyer . why cant we kick him out and replace him with Conan!?
I guess CONNAN WINS,  Can we win together… he the mystic man.
Best end of the season! I haven’t used this phrase in ages but Coco was a HOT MESS and it was wonderful! 😂😂😂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
YES!!!!! FINALLY!!!! Y'ALL HAVE REDEEMED YOURSELVES, HOT ONES! YES!!!! THANK YOU!!! ❤️
Conan is the best.
Best interview in a while
this was amazing
conan what a legend
It's a great show. Could you perhaps move back to having one table instead of two, like you used to originally? It looks nicer.
That was gross. Ha. Last thing anyone ever asked for was for Conan to be redder. 😂
Intriguing answers to equally intriguing questions, cartoonishly masochistic devouring of spicy wings, and a little ‘wanee-wanah’ for the old-school fans.  Conan put on a SHOW for all of us.
What a finale.
Top 5 episodes 😂😂😂
Lol. My favorite so far!😊
Conan you animal
I'm ONE minute FIVE SECONDS in and I can tell this is going to be a good one!
Been watching Conan since he started late night..the man never disappoints
Conan dealing with the bomb by not taking a breath between every word. Clever!
That was gross.😦
What a finale 🔥🔥🔥 This episode will go down in history of Hot Once! 🔥🔥🔥
What was bro on
I believe this is my new favorite
Never seen someone put a wing in their pocket😂😂😂
Now I can say I've finally seen Conan the Barbarian. What an animal.
Well, that was not boring…
Good luck after the cameras stop rolling, Conan. I hope you don’t seriously have to go to a hospital after this one :-)
I don't see how Hot Ones can ever be the same, after this. Conan has managed to shame every single previous guest, along with anyone who dares to show their face on future episodes. No one could possibly top this, in a million years.
This is hands down the best episode
Conan is the greatest
conan is legendary
i love this dude,.......he took it waaaaay too far, and i ain't mad at im'
+
We got an all-timer episode right  there
Sean didn't even stutter when Conan started putting wings into his pocket
Might be the funniest episode ever!!! 😂😂😂😂
Only Conan 😂
Nah hand down best episode 😂😂😂😂😂 Conan ain’t no BIOTCH!!!!!!!
Conan is the guest we didn’t know we needed/ this was all time. The man knew he was doomed and committed regardless
My top favorite ever😅😅😅
By far, the best episode of Got Ones ever. Wow.
Oh my god. I love Conan!!
Conan O' Brien is insane for that Da Bomb lick. He'll do anything for a laugh.
I want Conan to describe his toilet experience in detail
The best. Finally!
“What’s wrong with me!? WHY CANT I FEEL!?” That killed me!! 🤣🤣🤣
Conan turned into Lewis Black in the last 30 seconds lolol
I have not laughed this much in a looong time!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 this was EXCELLENT!!! HILARIOUS!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best episode ever
Great episode and Conan is the man!
This is a true homage to Conan’s legacy as a man who is willing to do anything, including destroy himself for comedy. Wow!
This will literally be the funniest most RAW and unabashedly insane Conan!! Wow Sean you rolled out the red carpet for the king 👑 amazing
2 min in this is the CONAN O BRIAN SHOW NOW !
I think this is now tied with the Dave Grohl episode as my favorite ever.
The funniest talkshow host hands down
Conan is king. 😁
Oh my God conan is actually the coolest
This was my favorite one ever. Conan won Hot Ones. 😂
BEST EPISODE EVER
I love this interview. When he is getting serious and telling us truly to not limit our sights in comedy .... he is leaning over spilled hot sauce and gesturing with a bottle and a messy face.
Literally the best interview ever!! This will go down not just in hot ones history but television history. Amazing!!!
We need Joe Rogan!!
What the f did I just see?!   This is the best Hot Ones finale I’ve seen in my life 🥵
This episode couldnt have gone better in any parallel universe. Sean gets incredible praise from arguably the best of his living peers, Conan is hilarious, Sean asks brilliant questions as always and they both consume a mind blowing amount of hotsauce
Greatest. Hot Ones. Ever.   So glad to see these guys together. 👍
I still remember when Conan had Slipknot on and they blew the roof off, and he loved every second of it.
This has to be the best interview of all time… Conan, you made my day. I laughed until I got heartburn ❤️‍🔥
embarrassing.
Got a little gross at the end.  I wonder if he will be hurting later.
Have not laughed that hard at a Hotones guest ever.
I’ve watched so many episodes of hot ones. For me, this might be the best. Conan is the GOAT
This is more epic than the last few Marvel movies I've seen.
What a showman! ❤ Conan!
My stomach ulcer just had a panic attack at the end there. 😳
22:16 I love how Conan is slowly turning into the Joker throughout this episode!! 😂
I love Conan
You invited this force of nature and you ( mostly ) coped with him !
Greatest episode ever!
🔥🔥🔥BEST.EPISODE.EVER.🔥🔥🔥
There has never been a better episode and you cannot change my mind
😂Conan is a legend
Please please please release the water Buffalo footage!!!
This might be the best episode so far.
"Call the Wife !!"
Thanks guys!
This is the weirdest show ever. He took Una alita para llevar
The absolute best.
Whelp, how can anybody top that?
"Grew up in an Irish household, didn't see a spice until I was 52"...hahaha....hes not wrong
conan is the goat
I am sure that the real party happened to the toilet afterwards
I think he has grave mouth but the capsaicin gave him psychosis 😂
best episode
Top notch episode! Conan seriously impressed us all and Sean handled the chaos, the comedy and the questions like a master. Absolutely top notch!
conan raising the bar on hot ones
Yo
Conan just putting the half eaten wings in his pocket is unhinged on it’s own and I love it
Need the Lisan Al'Gaib Edit after that based edit
What Did I Watch?   I haven’t laughed that hard in so long.  This was awesome.
this reminds me of the OG episodes with not as famous guests and i LOVED it!!
AWESOME!!!!!!
Absolutely the best episode ever Conan is a legend
Conan it the greatest!
absolutely incredible. At one point I thought the sauce bottles were fake, he was so committed. Best one yet.
Idk how Sean handled this man.... I would've 🪦 too many times from laughing so hard. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Did NOT disappoint.
I haven’t laughed this hard in a while!! Thank you Conan. You are a legend!
When invited Conan just decided he would have been the best and most chaotic Guest ever. AND HE DELIVERED
I've never seen a man so unhinged in my life. I'm crying I'm laughing so hard.
This episode is an absolute work of art. Bravo Conan.
We want more Conan O’Brien.
My favorite episode EVER!!! 😂😂😂
This always been my most wanted guest
If you want to freak out anyone over 40, point out that Conan has now been hosting late night television for longer than Johnny Carson did.
LEGEND!
I can't stand that idiot!!
Absolute legend!
Spice must flow!
Conan has said before that he needs a lot of anesthesia when he has surgery, likely because he’s a redhead. I wonder if that has anything to do with his performance. Or maybe the furnace that powers him just burns hotter than any wing could.
I think this is the best one I've seen 😅
"Mistake....I like to announce my mistakes up front." *Proceeds to destroy the penultimate wing* Conan is a monster...he just put Shaq to shame. If it weren't for his decades-long previous career, I'd think he was lying about being Irish.  EDIT: Nah, he's definitely got that Irish pub barfight energy.
This is the best episode and I haven’t even watched, that’s how goated Conan is.
Good show. But for me Conan came off a little too cocky by mocking the sauces. I guarantee he was burning up.
BEST ONE YET!
charlie rose show with hot wings hahahaha 🤣
Coco!!!
finally a good episode. thank god
It’s lit!!! The moment I’ve been waiting for. Time to blaze and indulge
Hats off to this guy
This was great!
I don't think there is an episode that can top this one
Is Conan OK?! haha :D
I have a weird odd ( no judgment to my coco) crush on this man !!!! He must be the best boo ! Lol
This will definitely be in the top-4 viewed videos on this channel. It’s simply legendary
Sean’s look of terror is so good
Conan also wearing a fancy margiela jacket 😅 may it RIP
I never knew I needed more fired up Conan in my life
LOL best episode in a long time
Conan taking those wings with so no one can clone him. Smart move "C".
Absolute comedy legend.
Conan is an absolute presence
Conan is a legend ☝🏼✌🏼
Best episode ever. Gonnabe tough to top this one Sean
Jesus Conan!  The jacket, the shirt…. And your poor, poor pants.
This was the best hot ones ever
Oh my ...hospital!!!😮
The Nixon impersonation 😭😭💀💀💀 ded  🪦
I love how he turns the heat into energy.  Fully committed!
Someone please check on Conan tonight
Had to look away/squint at the end bc wow so disgusting, loved it, thank you, best episode ever
Truly amazing all around. Haven't laughed that hard in a while. 😂😂
He is a legend! End of discussion.
All we need is Jensen Ackles now!
6:30 lol still bitter about Jay Leno.
Best Wing Drop Ever!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
I’ve watched this TWICE now.
I think that was full emotional breakdown by the end 😂 I loved it.
Irish people get a sun tan from spicy food 😂
That has to be the greatest hot ones video ever.
Best hot ones ever
I think his nose is bleeding
Incredible 👏🏼
Conan somehow evolved into a psychopath during this. I love every moment
This had me crying with laughter.  Conan is the best
I can listen to Conan yelling all day. Absolute Comedy Gold. 🏆
Conan is the GOAT wing eater and  this was the funniest episode of all time. 😂 Amazing
Conan Forever Goated lol lol
Conan, this has to be the best hot ones ever!!!! Dear lord never ever have a seen this!
No one has ever made the BOMB less intimidating.
THE GREATEST EPISODE EVER CONAN IS THE GREATEST 😂
Conan is nuts!
So happy to see this. I haven't felt as much affection for an entertainer since Robin Williams.He's just the best.
Conan is the officially the Hot Ones GOAT.
Conan doing the Putin table? 🤣
Nobody is beating this. I’ve never seen somebody throat DaBomb the way Conan did. Thats honestly the hottest sauce so the fact he just licked that wing and ate that way, that’s insanity lol Da Bomb Beyond Insanity
YESSSSSS CONAN WE LOVE HIM
If Da bomb is beyond insanity, Conan is where you get to after crossing that level! What a showman!
Best. Episode. Ever.
Conan channeling his inner Robin Williams. Just steered hard into the crazy skid.
I enjoyed the episode. But, it kinda seems like a parody of the show. If you asked SNL to make a Hot Ones Sketch, this is what would come out.
One of the few person that do not get on my nerves! 😂❤
This interview is just Conan slowly and gradually transforming into Trump 😂😂
Conan is truly the goat!! One of kind.   I’ve seen him a couple times out and about in LA, he’s always been super nice and engaged all the people and fans wanting his time.   Legend!!! 🫡
I love the show sometimes Sean's questions seem _too_ prepared if you know what I mean?
Thank you Conan.  You're absolutely the best.
Conan is absolutely unhinged… I am scared.
Conan's comedy is unparalleled. My favorite episode of hot ones by a longshot
This was genuinely one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen
Conan is just an amazing, classy, entertainer. He's very super strong willed. Amazing! So funny!
Best. Episode. Ever.
Conan crushed it - hands down best episode of hot ones
Sean is now the man....Not for Hot Ones.....  HES LIVING THE DREAM OF MEN...  HE'S DATING A.....P"RNSTAR😃😉👍👍
This episode went from calm and docile to over the top like no other episode before it! This one is my new favorite (Gordon Ramsay's episode is now second). As always, great questions,  great guest! Thoroughly entertained! Side note: I suspect Conan will regret the sauce he consumed afterwards though ;)
Yes, my favorite Conan, best😍❤️
Best episode yet.
I think we know who's gonna be in the Hot Ones hall of fame now.
Not gonna lie, but i'd be a tad bit intimidated by that energy! However i seriously think he beat Gordon Ramsay in popularity & outrageous uniqueness!(I just made up the last 2 words)!
"You say this is pure pepper" 🔥 conan#1
Legendary performance, not just for the comedy but also for the pain.
A show for the ages
We all needed Conan playing Nixon in our lives lol
😂 I love you Conan ❤ I’m sure Jordan is calling you a madman right now.
It’s all downhill from here.
Sean told Shakira last week that they were closing the season with her. That was a lie 🙃🙃
This might be the peak for now, great episode.
I just recently read a comment that Conan should be on show. Happy it fimally happened 😂😂😂
Been waiting for the conan interview since ep 1 this is legendary
Just like 20 years ago, when this man sees a water buffalo, he jumps on it. Legend!
Wow, that was Eric Andre levels of insanity from Conan. What a performer! This man lives so you can laugh.
Connan : I’m fine Also Connan: **face as red as a firetruck**
This episode was I C O N I C!!! 👏👏👏
One of the best episodes I seen. Top 5 for sure 😂
Conan!!!!!!😮😃😁 wooo!!!👏🙌🙌👏👏👍🤙🤟🤞✌✌✌👏👏🥳🤠😎🤓
Funniest thing I’ve seen in a long time! Loved it!
Greatest interview ever
I have finished only half of the video.. CONAN IS KILLING IT... ok, gonna continue the rest...
Im scared🙈
Man imagine if he was ever able to get Norm on
1:18 Conan’s hair is resembled in this chicken
LOVE
Woooow! What a beast! I love Conan but wouldn't have ever guessed that he would go by far the hardest a guest has EVER gone!
I nominate Conan as the best guest yet. Absolute Giga Chad!
Why can’t I feel 😂😂😂😂
This is quite possibly the most unhinged thing I’ve ever seen. It’s wonderful.
❤
Dr. Arroyo: he has an office in the desert.  Said with no wink.  Just excellent.
He has my respect
CONAN ON HOT ONES!!
Love Conan. Was always my favorite talk show host
Conan is the best
I love he comes in with bits
I’m pretty sure Conan drank a candle before the interview started
Well that was quite an experience
YEEEEES YES YES YES CONAN LFG
Best episode ever
This was the most entertaining episode EVER 🌶️ 🍗
This is definitely the most intense interview ever on this show! Just retire the show you ain't gonna get better than this
Conan showed up made it legit
FFS Conan's a nutcase. Quality all the same.
No Jordan Schlansky question, sad panda face.
I know Conan has stated in other media pieces that he has a high pain tolerance, and I took that with a grain of salt........but after seeing this I think he was probably being humble about it...
never tought id see this. i need this
This is peak interviewing
I love this maniac
🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Conan put everyone else to shame.
My goodness Conan's whole head turned a shade of red I've never seen before. But I have to admit, he handled the wings better than any person I've ever seen.
This will go down in history as one of the most legendary episodes of Hot ones ever
Mad props to Conan for diving headfirst into this the way he did. He is and will always be great.
The ONLY guest that made laugh.
This had Andy Kaufman levels of insanity committed to the bit levels. I loved it. When is Conan coming back?
This might be the first video on youtube where I cried both from laughter and from experiencing a deep sense of gratitude.  Conan always always been hilarious, but I must also thank Sean for providing a platform where Conan can give us a peek of his intellect and philosophical approach to his absolutely unique brand of comedy.  Conan's words cut deep - don't box yourself in, go out there and experience everything there is, and find the comedy within. Thank you both, giants of the interview process.
Conan just beat the game
It was absolutely chaotic
Conan is the literal goat
Season 23 finale is going in the books for sure. What an interview! Conan is just brilliant!
It's official. Conan is a psychopath 😱
what a legend! 😂
Not all heros wear capes. Hands down, the best episode
Holy duck. Conan you absolute madlad and legend
conan reminds us that that the proverbial Clown will always be an essential part of showbusiness
Slow clap
Was he on something??? Oh my God  Conan was insane
Conan O'Brien is Da' Bomb
They had to have given conan fake sauce. Absolutely no way he did all that 😭
THE ABSOLUTE  BEST EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
Best guest EVER!!!!
One of the best episodes. Hilarious.
One of the best episodes ever on this show, love it! Thanks for everything you do Sean also Conan is goated
It's not even close that this is the best ep ever! Conan FTW
I'm going back into work from lunch looking like my whole family died from the tears of laughter.
Conan is a blast unrivaled
Norm MacDonald is buckled over in heaven laughing so hard he ascends to the next level. Such an incredible interview and performance by Conan.
That was GOLD
hysterical 🤣
I haven’t laughed that hard in a while. Thanks Conan you’re still the best.
Conan V Meyers. Show me that show.
How much effort Conan puts into making a joke.. It's legendary.
Well, that was disturbing.
Might be the best hot ones episode period
Words fail me. 😂
Wing drop is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Conan should sell that jacket with the chicken still in it for charity
😮😂❤❤❤nooooo wayyyy i love Him can’t wait to watch this !!!!!!!
The most epic hot ones guest of all time
An Absolute Madman in peak form.
Never laughed so hard watching the show. Conan truly is king
funniest episode ever, sean couldnt stop laughing 😂😂
Me and a couple of my friends did this for the first time and da bomb made the last dab taste weak somehow
So funny!  Conan is over the top!
It is so cool to see Conan give Sean his flowers. Obviously, Sean deserves it, but for Conan to take the time to know Hot Ones, to watch enough to know Sean is great, and then to earnestly give that complement without any laughs, I think speaks a lot about how humble Conan has been and continues to be. I mean, the dude in a lot of people's opinions is the king of late night, with accolades and all the good things, but he can't help but to shine the spotlight on the people in front of him.
Conan final boss
This is literally the best one I’ve ever seen
🤣🤣🤣🤣 ayooo this episode was great it’s on my top 5
Umm, why is he putting the wings in his pocket?
Legendary!
*DIES LAUGHING* Sean looking at Conan like "OMFG he's a walking lawsuit..." 😂😂😂😂😂
Almost every time I watch an episode of Hot Ones, I find myself craving wings afterward.  Not so much this time.  That said, Conan's level of commitment to his bit was extraordinary.  Bravo!
Still laughing.  F@cking sensational.
i'm 4 minutes in, i'm losing it over conan putting the wings in his coat pocket
I've never seen someone out hot wing Sean. It's like outboxing Mike Tyson in his prime! This was so hilarious Conan has to be in the hall of fame instantaneously!
Yes! Love Conan
The Best Video Ever!! Conan is a Beast!! 😲
Y’all must keep a plumber on speed dial!😂
This is one for the vaults!  One of the best episodes ever!
😳😳😳😳😳😳🙈
I was worried about him 😅 I mean some people end up in a hospital after hot peppers
The fact that the doc said he went to App State is hilarious and spot on. Go Dukes.
20:40 and everything that follows is pure gold
This is peak Conan. He is not afraid to look ridiculous in the name of comedy. I still can't believe he showed his bruise on television after he fell from the buffalo. What a professional
Love Conan. So glad he did this.
This was a really good episode =) i might add this was probably the best one yet in my opinion =) it had great questions and absolutely hilarious comedy =) you brought back his old SNL persona for sure =)
Love how Conan went all out!!! WILD!!!! and wildly funny!!
As someone named Max, this was a…unique experience hearing my name so much in one video
He’s the funniest person in the entire world. Possibly in all history.  Groucho is a hack in comparison. Truth.
My God, he is just a skeletor. Can nothing stop him?!?! 21:35
Conan Is absolutely amazing
Conan, you are the greatest.
By far the best and funniest episode
Wow 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
this is unhinged lol
Conan is the goat! Finally a great entertaining guest again!
Conan beasting 😮
Pure chaos! Lol
This was beyond epic
Sometimes an unexpected synchronization happens. This was not one of those times. Sean just got taken to School by that Da Bomb move! Conan always entertains and love Dr. Arroyo  I didn't know how much I needed this - I'm literally crying on the floor ☠️❤ - gasp!  - 😭🤣🤣🤣
Conans Dr. must be related to Dr. Vinny Boombatz
You know you fked up when even Shaun is uncomfortable 😂😂
I did not realize there were so many Conan stans..... don't get it, personally, but I'm glad the fans got what they had been asking for. Lol
What. A. Legend.
best hot ones yet
I haven't seen Sean that afraid of a guest since Idris Elba wanted to fight him. Also HD close-ups were a MISTAKE for this ep.
Conan is the GOAT
There was so much in this episode. I have to watch it again.
Future...America is in dangerous grounds from severe terrorism. Your being invaded
Would love to see Conan on other youtube channels like Smosh or Game Grumps
Boston Irish are nothing like rural Irish. All my Irish country boys love spice, smoked meats and flavorful foods. Sheeeeiiiiit
13:43 I have never laughed at a Youtube video this hard before, Conan is the GOAT
Green teeth😂
Jesus Christ Conan
Best Show Ever!!!
Conan has just raised the bar
legendarno
What a way to send the season ✨I can already see the GIFs and memes .
best episode of hot ones. period.
PLEASE Guys, bring on more WWE Wrestlers!!! HHH, John Cena, Roman Reigns, Cody Rhodes, Seth Rollins, even Logan Paul!
Just because he was drooling at the mouth doesn’t mean there wasn’t truth to his words “there’s comedy in the Old Testament, there’s comedy in the New Testament” might be some of the deepest words I’ve heard all year.
First time a wing was completely skipped. What was wing #9’s question??
No lie this was the best one yet
I've watched every single Hot Ones...some of them many times over, and this is the first time I am literally CRYING with laughter throughout the whole episode. Conan is really on another level...especially him clearly admitting that he is giving it his all for the sake of the comedy, at the expense of his wellbeing, so he can reach a younger audience.  Sean was just holding on for dear life the whole time...and was very happy to do so....Best episode yet...and that's saying something.
Does... does he not have spice receptors?
This guy is f'n crazy and i love him!!!
What a legend!
They need Jordan Schlansky on hot ones 😂
i was so worried he was going to rub his eyes.
God and baby Jesus
This man is so unhinged, i love him
Easily one of the best 😂
This is the absolute most mad performance ever!   I adored every second of it!   CONAN IS THE GOAT!
17:13 he actually started changing colours here, over the course of 10 seconds he becomes very red lol
Sean asks great questions but in such a stilted way
This HAS to be the best episode since Gordon Ramsey. Hats off to Conan 👏👏
Finally, my favourite talk show host Conan. I have never clicked on a video so fast.
Conan cements himself as the GOAT. This is one of the best interviews I've ever seen. Laughing out loud!
Sean usually tries to mirror the guest. Conan broke him
Outridiculed the ridiculousness the show .
conan was wearing that same jacket on curb your enthusiasm. i wonder if sean got conan clearance
Conan is a savage wow
"Conan needs a friend" so badly, he took on the wings of death!
Conan never fails to impress his fans. I was impressed how he was able to eat that spicy wings when he wasn't even exposed to spicy food most of his life.
Thank you Conan!
I love Conan!
Conan is the second coming of Christ.
Well that escalated quickly.
This the best of 30 years of Conan, I almost die looking this crazy MF going while on that hot sauce.
Sean should've asked him which guest made him laugh the most and I bet the answer is Bill.
Jesus Loves You! ❤❤
Is he still alive ????
22:48 "CALL THE WIFE"
I can't believe how composed he was after Da Bomb, let alone how he survived absolutely drowning the last wing in sauce.  This one will be tough to beat.
Nothing will EVER beat this.
José Arroyo has been one of Conan's comedy writers for such a long time! He also played some characters on the old Late Night show.
PLEEEAASSEE LADY GAGA NEXT!!!
I mean, Conan ruled the whole thing...F**k, pure entertainment!!!
Conan brought Dr Nick Riviera
Conan... My favorite masshole
Hows my pulse?   It's there..
To use the word unhinged would be an understatement. I can't think of anyone that could top this interview.
I don't usually comment on youtube videos, but good lord. What a pro. Cracking jokes while plugging and pouring milk out of his mouth. full credit.
I’ve never wheezed this hard in my life
What was Conan on lol
Legend.
I think we can all agree that we have reached PEAK Hot Ones!
It's not a food remote if Conan didn't put anything in his pockets
lol an ad for Texas tourism? Good luck in a state that hates women.
This was the best episode... literally in tears laughing.
Conan is simply the best.
I don't watch many videos that have me actually laughing out, but wow this one did.
Bro
I love Conan even more now and I didn’t think that was possible!
His lips turn the color of his hair! Best challenge ever!
My favorite episode this season Conan killed it!!😂😂😂
Conan is chaos personified 😂
How is Conan still alive?????? Lol
I knew Conan would have a schtick, but I thought he would be overly dramatic at how hot it was, not go the other way.
Conan’s the Best!
At this point I think everyone knows Sean is the greatest interviewer there is.
Never watched an episode of this before today, but always knew the premise and cultural significance there of. But to have Conan on, wasn't going to miss that, *ever.* Did *not* disappoint. If there's a Mt Rushmore of "always on" comedians, I can't think of 7 guys more deserving to be on it than him.
I am not envious of the bathroom toilet Conan had to use after this show 😂
The bomb got bombed 😂
One day I will be on this show 🙏🏾
Conan just put on a master class on how to handle the wings. Man's nuts, and I'm here for it 100%
What an episode! Conan is the goat
legend
Everyone is talking about the compliment he gave lets talk about the absolute beast he was at those wings good luck any guest ever beating that he made the top half last dabs then just started drinking bottles dudes about to be 61  and out did every hot ones guest before him What's the point of being alive if we cant do this Conan 2024 legend
*Jeff the Producer* : Give that man an Emmy !!
When I learned Conan killed Bea Arthur 😲…allegedly…not
Best episode ever!!!! Love you Coco!!!!
In watching this video I am reminded of why I prefer conan in a purely audio medium.   Im just joking conan forever <3333
The best guest on this show. Easily.
😮 I have seen alot of hot one videos this is one is up there in being  a little ridiculous ...and out there  Conan is being a little over the top
After that many years in the entertainment industry conan is a savage and a menace 😂
Conan's been around my whole life. I remember staying up late as a kid and him being my first experience with Late Night TV. Now I'm 32 and he's still going strong. I'm not a fan of putting celebrities up on pedestals, but Conan is hands down an icon of Comedy.  I also love how he is a history buff because he has undoubtedly cemented his place in history.
What a beast, Conan sir my hat off to you!!
He and Jake take the cake
There's a Max Power joke in here somewhere.
THERE WILL NEVER BE A BETTER EPISODE THAN THIS.
insanity. bravo
I just love that Conan brought a bit with him. 😂❤ Love you Coney
By far the best episode to date. I’m broken 🤣
See Ice Spice? That’s how it’s done😂
What a mad man.
Welp. This is the roof. What are you going to do Hot Ones? Because it's all downhill from here.
Greatest episodes of all time. Nothing will ever top this.
God I love Cconan
I think Conan topped all the other guests. The series has peaked, time to wrap it up.
Sean progressively losing it is the best thing :D edit: Is Conan freakishly tall or is Sean smal????
Conan turned into Redbar this episode
Fcking Epic!
🙌🏻🔥❤ GOAT
I'm certain that Conan caught sean so off guard with his antics. Conan's a masterclass entertainer
Conan the OG
conan is an absolute legend.
This has got to top 2MM views. Conan is the best
6:22 The shade of it all.
Legend.
Yo same birfday as Conan let's go
This is the first time ever I liked and commented before watching... I mean, it's Conan!  ... Back here after watching... Oh, f***ing wow! This episode will never be topped! Conan, you bsolute f***ing legend!
Wow!It is the best performance, nice episode
Best episode ever!
I can't think of a more entertaining Hot Ones. This one was incredible! 🔥🔥
Clown
Two of my favorite interviewers in the same show! ( Graham Norton is the third)
Conan the goat
16:52 😂😂😂😂😂😂  I love how conan just makes an absolute mess
wow
Me at the beginning : Oh I can't wait to see Conan eat his words.  Conan: Hold my half empty bottle of Da Bomb.  Conan, we are not worthy you are the once and forever king.  Sean, please post what hospital Conan was sent to so we can all send flowers.  Legend. Epic. Conan.
This is the best episode of Hot Ones ever oh man
The greatest guest ever
16:16 YEAH BAILEY IT'LL BE FUN, BAILEY  17:50 RICHARD NIXON. OH MY GOD, IT'D BE FANTASTIC
The doctor kept popping up had me dying of 😂.. 👏
What's happening?!?!!?
Finally! I hoped for this collab! Conan finally got it!
He's crazy, a bit too crazy... I was waiting for him literally crying but it never happened
Conan O'Brien is the best guest. Talk about going all in. The best finale!
I've never clicked on a YT video so fast in my life 😭😂
That got out of hand.
holy...s... that was funny.
I'm highly uncomfortable
Did you lie to Shakira that she was the last episode of the season ? 👀👀👀
PURE INSANITY
Perfect show. Perfect guest. This is making my day.
What a legend!
Hands down, the best guest hot ones has ever had on.
This was THE BEST ONE EVER. That´s it that´s all
😭👈 cool whipped cream
Best episode EVER! 🔥🔥😂🤣
Conan O'Brien has raised the bar for every future Hot Ones guest. He'll be difficult to top, no question.
23:50, shot of dripping sauce
Unreal performance. Good god he’s gonna feel that in a few hours.
FINALLY YOU GUYS HAVE THE GOAT TALK SHOW HOST ON HERE
Good luck trying to top that
I love that the purpose of this show was to throw interviewees just a bit off-kilter, and finally it was Sean's turn to be thrown entirely off his interview game.
I am not fit for this office and should never have been here. I knew that this job would be too much for me. Warren G. Harding
Why is Conan not on TV when he’s infinitely more entertaining and genuine than either of the Jimmy’s?
I'm def dumber for watching that, but I'm still crying from laughing so hard. Thank you Coco!
what a experience
legend！！！
❤Conan 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥pulling a Napoleon Dynamite pocketing the food for later. Arnold next please😎
Can't wait for the show on April 18
The cleanup crew definitely had to work hard after this one
Am I the only one that thinks Conan isn't that funny and kinda insufferable?
I've always loved Conan. I loved all his answers. Him drinking hot sauce is insane 😂😂❤❤❤
Wow! This ought to be the most incredible Hot Ones ever. I knew it would be great! It's Conan. 😍
I think Dr. Arroyo went to Hollywood Upstairs Medical College alongside Nick Riviera. 😂  Also, next season: CM Punk, yes?
Wow. , at 16:52  is EASILY THE CRAZIEST THING A GUEST HAS E V E R   DONE !
Greatest episode of all time. Hands down.
I mean :D Im speechless! Maybe one of the first guests that Sean didnt know what to do with him? It was not that funny tbh, but..man.. he is bada**. Iconic
Best first we feast episode ever😮😮😮😮
“WHY CANT I FEEL?!”   *Drinks hot sauce just to feel something.  I felt that. 🥀
The best guest and episode by far
I think this tops Bobby Lee sh*tting his pants. I think it tops them all.
what a pokerface
Conan the King
Look how RED Conan’s fingers got after handling  Da Bomb!!!😮
Even the hot wings would throw in the towel...."Nope, even we can't shut him up"
Best one yet. Easily.
I appreciate Conan's self-awareness. He never leaves any DNA evidence behind for others to potentially misuse.
Good luck topping this episode!
I expected pure insanity, I got pure insanity. Good episode!
Dr. Arroyo was the best thing LOL!
It’s so nice to have one of the best hosts of all time taking some time out of his day to interview Conan O’Brien. Such a legend
Literally love this show, but you guys have once again outdone yourselves!! Hands down the greatest episode in hot ones history!!! Conan is the 🐐
CRUSHES IT. RIDING HEAT LIKE A BOSS.
I'm convinced Conan is pulling a Homer Simpson and put wax on the inside of his mouth
Funniest video I have watched. Period. Love you Conan!
I LOVE CONAN!!!!!! Glad to see em on the show!
Mean while DJ Khaled quits after the 3rd wing😂 Billy Burr watching this 👀: “Jesus Christ Conan!”
Shout out to Edward R. Murrow!
arguably the funniest and most visceral Hot Ones I've seen
This is the peak. The ultimate. The Coco can 110% still Gogo. What. A. Legend.
Comedy Gold.
I got serious Chris Farley vibes from Conan towards the end. It was great!
THE BEST
I thought there was no way he’d finish, but I didn’t count on his commitment to the bit.
“You’re just choking me, no no, you just feel for the pulse” 😂😂😂
THE G.O.A.T.!!!!
Nardwuar?
Coco let's go hahaha whatever
True comedy unhinged!
my only wish is to one day meet conan. but that would never happen bec im a commoner.. (sad face).
Less than 3 minutes in and I'm dying laughing. Conan is, and will always be the king.
L E G E N D
He floating HIGH
Conan was fully insane by the end of the show 😂😂😂
It's been decades and nobody has ever made me laugh as hard as Conan O'Brien!
He's so f_cking crazy! That was nice!!! He's gonna pay the price after that ouch!!!!
Only Conan to pour some bomb sauce on The Bomb 💣 and say yeah i feel this one a lil bit 🤣🤣🤣🤪🤪
This is amazing. Conan never disappoints
Chaucer's tales are hilarious. He's right
Did... Did this just become my favorite episode ever?
Haven't even gotten to the video, stuck in an ad but still a thumbs up
Conon did What i dream of doing on the show if i was famous .Respect
I thought Eric Andre was unhinged. This was on another level 😂 what a legend 🫡
epic guest and episode!
The fastest I've ever clicked on a video.
this is a love letter to entertainment itself. Thank you Conan <3
Ok Conan, Jesus, i'll order Max, Christ!
Conan: was it a 4 year medical school? Dr: it was supposed to be  Conan: ...did you even graduate? 16:43  ☠️
This might be the most chaotic episode haha. Dr Arroyo is such a Conan bit, I liked how he broke character at the end when he took his final temperature
Wonka vibes
This was incredible
I literally have tears rolling down my face 😅😂😂😂 it got so unhinged at the end there
The absolute Goat himself.. What a legend
I don’t remember the last time I’ve been this excited for a video
Masterful. Simply masterful.
Ice spice: “I love spicy food” *fails miserably in the most boring interview* Conan: “I’m terrible with spice” *kills it while being hilarious*
Probably the best episode I've seen
Jimmy Fallon furiously taking notes...
Ramsay is now #2. Well done, Sean - well done!
The master is and always will be the great one!
The only thing wrong with this episode is that I love Conan’s Jean jacket and now I’m worried the pockets are ruined 😂
This is the best guest ever.
This was the craziest one yet. I don't know how you can top this!
Conan can’t give up the spotlight can he
Chaos reigns.
Conan is the love of my life 😩😩 miss you CoCo 🫶🏼🫶🏼
i havent laughed that hard in years. that was absolutely incredible. bravo!
This guy is something else! 😮 demonstration of peak talent and showmanship. Sean couldn't keep it together.
Smokey J is brilliant.
The wildest guest of all time.
That was legendary.
This man has a whole human as a prop. Literal Legend Edit: Made this comment before finishing the episode. Now, I feel legend is an understatement. GOD
What a way to go out! RIP  (I assume)
I never comment on anything but this was by far THE BEST EPISODE! I'm in tears and once again Conan proves that he is the greatest of all time. ... still wiping tears and laughing.
This might be number one on my list! Even better than Dave Grohl!
23:00 is gonna be an ig reel
This is the one I've been waiting/asking for since day one! Thank you hot ones and shaun evans
Just clicked and my god, this is the crossover i needed.
Conan's the best.
What ever happened to guests who tapped out?  I guess you'll just have to start eating nuclear waste, or pond water or something.
Mad science at its finest.
i feel like hotones is going to be shut down after this
He can deal with the pain, he is laughing in the face of Pain...He trully is Conan the Lisan al Gaib
Bravo Conan! You've outdone yourself and surprised one of your oldest fans! Been a fan since '93. 👏👏👏👏👏
my god. the wings were scared shitless.
And that was last Conan was ever seen. Shortly after the tapping of this episode he went completely mad. He spent the rest of his days in an asylum asking where his wings he kept stored in his pocket were.
That was epic. Conan is the GOAT
Holy 💩.  Conan is a legend!  He ate those wings like a champ!   Best episode ever!
Is max medical really this bad 😳😳😳😷
saami perjantai
Hot ones was made for Conan
“He doesn’t even understand the numbers” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Greatest episode of all time
I went to 1998 school too
The bar has reached unachievable height after this. No one has, and no one will do it better. Legend.
I said what I said Conan
Conan has defeated all wings.
Between Conan being an absolutely incredible guest, him making Sean giggle uncontrollably throughout the interview, and the Dr. Arrayo bit that he fully committed to, this has to be my favorite episode.
Conan is the best late night host ever and it's not even close. Long may he reign!
this has to best the interview all season!   Conan is crazy for drinking the bomb and the last dab. Good thing he has a doctor on standby lol
I have never laughed harder at this show, and probably not harder at anything in the last year. Conan brought the house down. True GOAT, god-king of Hot Ones.
Conan O'Brien never fails to make me laugh. And Sean getting a compliment like that from a power house like Conan must feel special.
"Can I keep these?" feels like such an early Simpsons gag. Conan is one of the all time comedy greats.
Now all we need is for Sean Evans and Nardwuar to interview each other
Conan praising Sean's interviewing skils is a magical moment for him, you can see it in his face😁🪄🌶️🌶️🌶️  Conan then proceeds to be outrageously hilarious and literally drinking hot sauce🤣🤣🔥🔥👨‍🚒🧗‍♂️🔥🔥🔥
What a performance. Conan is incredible. 😂
My favorite host ever and one of my favorite personalities ever ; Conan O’Brien. Not surprised this is my favorite episode, this man is a riot! True master of comedy. What an episode this’ll be hard to top
The goat!
Oh my god... I always knew Conan O'Brien was a popular American TV host but I've never watched anything involving him until now.... And I can see why he's so popular. He's a RIOT! But also seems genuine ✨
Easily the funniest hot ones episode I've watched every single episode and Conan is by far the most hype maybe aside from Ramsey
The person responsible for guest booking has redeemed themselves.
This is The most epic yet!
Conan is EPIC
That water buffaloe never worked in showbiz again.. just sayin'. Don't mess with Conan.
Thank you for this amazing episode, conan always delivers what he is not supposed to. ❤
This was so cringe i couldn’t finish watching it
Sean appears legitimately frightened and then both concerned and amused at 22:53 after Conan devoured The Last Dab Pepper X. Legendary interview. Absolutely legendary. Unhinged Conan is peak Conan.
Glad Sean's beautiful suede jacket is unharmed 🙏
Just shoving wings into his pockets 😂
Is this not the best one? Shut it down. Conan is the king.
I love that Conan could be saying something that sounds way out of pocket, but he really means it on a deeper level. He is the pure embracer of life in its full chaotic form.   Hes awesome
Wow he did not disappoint!!! I'm legitimately inspired
I'm asking myself "What did I just witness?!" but the only answer is slapstick gold. Conan did not hold back or disappoint. My only wish is that he would have let Sean get more in depth with the questions. There's so much left to unpack. That said, leaving the audience wanting more is the hallmark of a great episode. Well done team.
Holyyy fffff this was good!! 😂😂😂 Conan is a Beast!!!
I was scrolling, all I saw was the hair and I knew it had to be Conan 😂
Wow 😂😂😂😢😢
This is instant legend of an episode.
Easily one of my fave episodes.
Instantly one of the best hot ones episodes
21:00 Chris Farley tribute
The greatest entertainer I have ever seen.
Why did I watch this while having lunch? I'm laughing and feeling queasy at the same time lol Love Conan 😆
Conan is a MADMAN!!!  Anything for a bit, but your poor backside will be the one to pay when the cameras are off.
Brilliant! The best one yet. Conan is comedy gold 😂
love that subtle dig at leno lol
Conan is simply the best.
That was a fire engine hose of comedy.
GO CONAN! What a BEAST!
Best guest! By far!
The absolute insanity 🤣
Brilliant! Conan is a magic man.
Conan pocketing the left over wings took me out. 💀
Wow!!!!
Of course he gives the most sincere compliment to Sean about his superb interviewing skills. There is nothing I don't love about Coney. He WOULD bring in a doctor to check his pulse by strangling him just 8 minutes into the interview. COMMIT TO THE BIT!  GOD LOVE THIS MAN!!!!!!
Not just the best spice ones interview but one of the best ever interviews period
DR. ARROYO!!!!!
Props to the sketch of the water buffalo story. Things like that make it that much more hilarious
Conan always has the best bits- living legend
Conan’s a better host than guest smh
THAT WAS YOUR BEST ONE YET!!!!!
This was everything I had hoped it would be.
Thank god Conan won't film the exit.
sometimes people forget
Simply amazing.
That was insane and I loved every moment of it
💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼love this episode!!!!!!!!!!
I love how Conan is essentially parodying people who get overconfident on the wing spiciness. The man is a consummate performer.
Is Dr Arroyo taking new patients?
BEST SHOW OF ALL TIME
This episode will go down as the peak of this channel, you guys have reached new heights.
Holy moly you got one of my favorite people in the world to listen to!  You got the Cones Man himself!  Cant wait to watch him turn tomato red.
conan hasn’t aged a day
I don't' like the 2 table split, feels too distant
Instead of checking to see if Conan was alright after the sauce, someone should check if the sauce is alright after Conan! It went... places and did... things! Most epic episode ever!
Conan is my hero. Best episode ever.
❤
Conan getting a gastritis in 3 2 1....... 🤣
The whole time I'm wondering what he's actually planning to do with those leftover wings
How is this not the most viewed one yet
Drinking the final sauce is crazy
This is the best episode ever and the one where the guest goes 100% all in on experiencing the sauce. We bow to you Spice Lord Obrien!
Ive never seen Sean afraid of his guests😂😂 Conan broke him on the last wing
I shouldn't be surprised by how good this was.  Conan hires an actor to play his "doctor,'" who is very good because he is very cheap, then pockets the wings and chugs hot sauce while complimenting Sean for being a great interviewer and being a part of his show while making it completely their own. brilliant on all accounts
An absolute maniac. Incredible episode 😂🤣💀
This was amazing 🤯
THIS IS THE BEST MOST EPIC INTERVIEW EVER!! I’m open mouth laughing 🤣🤣🤣☠️🪦
THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE GREATEST EPISODE OF HOT ONES EVER!!!!! Instant epic classic!
BEST. EPISODE. EVER. WOW.
The Warren G Harding bit was so funny, Conan is such a great guest.
what an absolute LEGEND. First episode I've seen all the way through
Conan is the GOAT!
Im so glad I found out about conan like 10 years ago. He's the funniest person out there.
Always a Fracking Legend!!
“I’m perfectly fkn fine” 😂. Absolute beast.
“I don’t fear your wings, man” 😎
Brilliant!
Leave it to Conan to hot sauce his nippled
Conan > ALL
This dude really wanted to beat Gordon Ramsay in terms of showing the audience a good show and he succeeded
Conan bodied Khaled for all time
Hilarious Conan making fun of whiny crying celebrities collapsing at Wing #3 asking if they forgot what real danger looks like
I have never laughed as much watching a hot ones episode. DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!!!
Conan, you absolute legend! He had me in tears.
This is, without a doubt, the best Hot Ones episode of all time.
Holy Moly😂😂😂. How much Kxkain did he has in his Body 😂😂 Freaking Out completly
BEST EPISODE YET!!!
the ending was worth it
Makes Steveo look like nothing
Best show ive seen so funny
Legend
I like Conan, but he was actually too much for me in this episode.
The man is a literal chaos god. No wonder the Traveller from Critical Roll looks just like him! Travel Safe my friend. 🧐✌️
Hands down my favorite episode of all time. Hot ones can still produce interesting and insightful interviews, but for me none will ever be more entertaining.
This was pretty funny
Oh! My! Gooooooooooooooood!!! :D :D :D
Conan is a national treasure 👍
Man I love Conan. Such a genuine dude and always makes me laugh.
IM FINE !.. I'M PERFECTLY 🤬FINE 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Best guest since you've started the show.
13:45 😅😅😅
The Clown Prince of Comedy! craziest episode ever
Comedic gold right here. I loved this way more than I expected I would. ❤
Conan was the Best out of any guests you have ever had period
Top 5 best guests easily. Conan is a monster! I was hoping Jordan Schlansky would make an appearance though but the Dr was pretty good.
Connan jest zajebisty
"ARE WE DOING THIS OR NOT!" 16:56 I have been anticipating this one! Conan is a legend in any format!
For once I don't think Sean was remotely prepared for what was about to happen. Easily the funniest episode ever.
Dropping the wing had me dying, Conan is a legend.
I prepared my body in various ways for this video
Conan is starting to look like Ellen lol
This was hands down the best hot ones ever. And I'm not even the biggest Conan fan😂😂😂
The KING
He’s the Flaming C, made to stand the heat!!
Daym, Joe Rogan and Donald Trump are looking so young in this one 😳
BEST ONE YET
They always say never meet your heroes and I think that is so true for me now. Watching this show after buying the first half of the sauces and none of them being spicy makes me think everyone is lying lol.
That was so chaotic 😂
Legend 😂
Legend
LISAN AL GAIB
😊💜💜💜
nbc messed up so much.  conan has ascended ever since he left!
Love me some Conan ❤❤❤
Conan is iconic as iconic gets, this was the best hot ones interview I've ever seen
That was one of the best episodes ever!!  If not the BEST ever...
By the end Conan turned into the turnip lady lol
CALL THE WIFE
Cry lauging in a chipotle parking lot by myself, thanks conan and hot ones 😂😂😂😂😂
This had my crying 😂
This is the best possible ad for Conan's show
Epic
Conan just broke the show!! No one will ever come close to this level of insanity!! 🤣🤣
Can't believe Sean held it together with what was going on in front of him. This was the craziest Hot Ones ever. Conan was fearless, and this was the most enjoyable 27 minutes of watching him that I've ever seen.
Konan O'Brien killed it.The best hot ones ever!😂😂
This needs to be the most watched episode
*In Sardukar: “Power over spice is power over all.”
This is the greatest this show will ever get
conans the best
Conan singlehandedly just made the greatest Hot Ones episode of all time. His comedic timing and unhinged humour is unparalleled. Legend.
We need a post-Hot Ones video of my man Conan 😂😂😂 🔥
Absolutely love the unhinged nature of this man
I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. Thank you.
This man. He is a living legend
WOW👏
This is the best episode ever.  Conan is the best!
Didn't expect Conan to go full barbarian on the wings 😂
End the show.
I can't believe he did that haha. His poor stomach.He is actually not sweating as much as I think he should be.
I pity the guest that now has to open next season, this is the pinnacle and can not be topped...
Nice 👍
Jesus. Conan is a barbarian.
YES
Really my favorite comedian sidekick. Love his episodes with Norm MacDonald als Bill Burr
Awesome.
The best episode ever!!!!!!
Conan is the best to ever do it and this episode was legitimately the best episode ever Conan MADE the show
Conan is the bomb
Buffalo story wins!
The best
i have not laughed so much in many years, thank you Sean and Conan for this wonder of the modern age.
Truly my favorite episode by miles.
Just a legendary appearance by Conan 👏 👏 👏
Conan is the best
"What's wrong with me? Why can't I FEEL?"
No questions about his time as a barbarian?!
Anyone else notice on Da Bomb, Conan had a water then swapped to milk? He found the real one! 😂
This episode is top tier
More like Conan GOAT'brien because he is, and has been, the best late nite has to offer for the last 20 years. At least!
"The other guy..."  Cold, but... people still talk about Conan's time hosting late-night television.
Conan is a Legend
i love conan
Conan literally ate the most hot sauce out of any guest ever ….  I am thoroughly impressed of man of my complexion could even get halfway through this.
I love Conan, he's just so entertaining. One of the few American hosts I genuinely love.
Conan is insane. I love this so much. I also love his disrespecting the hot sauce like a boss.
IT'S HAPPENING, CONAN IS ON THE SHOW
Conan is probably the one authentic Late Night host with Leno and Letterman that ever existed and he got duped. I love that he's doing good <3 !
one of the greatest
God I just adore Conan ❤
Conan just destroyed all the other episodes, he is just the perfect specimen of a comedian!
Proof Conan is the best to ever do it
Sona next
Perfect season finale, Conan is the best!
Wow this made my day 😂
Of course the first thing conan does is do a bit with a doctor
🐐
The internet is going to explode after this episode
Licking the sauce🤨.........so nobody has learned from what Chrissy Teigen did.
If you pause the intro @1:07 and look at the table, you can get a preview of how this episode goes.
What a pro
Sean giggled so much haha
Possibly the best run of wings we've ever seen?
The First Hot Ones episode I cannot finish.  I made it to 9:38, wondered if sticking it out to see this man truly in pain was worth it, decided nope.  He was so obnoxiously disrespectful.
The doctor bit is like a Marx Bros movie.
This is pure madness and I absolutely love it!
Legendary performance! He probably didn't feel much because gingers have no souls.
This easily the best and funniest Hot Ones Episode ever 😂
The legend
The Best!❤
best hot ones ever
😂10/10
This was beyond crazy.
I love Conan so, so much
This is the best!! BEST EPISODE EVER!!!!
Best episode so far
Did he slather his mouth in Oragel before starting?
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!! 😂
THANK YOU Conan for your IMMACULATE performance. You’ll always be my comedy hero. This episode was GOLD. Love you to bits and I hope you continue down your glorious path. Much love from India ❤
Best late night host ever. Absolute legend.
He is comedy 🎉😂
this was amazing. ty. an actual naturally funny and humble person <3
Not really a Conan fan....until now.  Mad respect for him after this.  Insane.  Didn't do the "final dab".  Conan did the pour.  Crazy.
First of all SEAN just got knighted by CONAN on his interview skills, well deserved of course. Also, to me CONAN  will always be my favorite talk show host and human being, if you don't laugh when your watching him there something wrong with you 😂👍🍀
TORILLE
Just... WOW.
Best episode so far!
That was amazing. Easily one of the best episodes, if not the best.
Conan is the Hot Ones GOAT
That is the funniest one I have ever watched!!
Interview Jordan Peterson.
Conan is an absolute beast
Has he bettered Paul Rudd?
This I will be sending to everyone 🎉
Conan is, and will always be the greatest of all time.
This will rack up millions of views. Phenomenal
Conan calling the Jay Leno "The other guy" is hilarious
Goat
conan can't say "bruise" haha he has to say "Hematoma"
Would love to see the BTS of this lol
A true blue professional showman. Love this man for showing up to work and giving it 110%
Que buen show c*r*jo!
Seems like you guys close out another season every other week
He's a madman. He's our madman
My two favorite interviewers ever! What a joy!
I knew this day would come but I can't believe Sean got Conan O'Brian😮!!!!
I'm crying! Conan killed this!
I think O’Brien finally lost it
This had to be the most iconic moment of this show when Conan starts drinking the hot sauce and even more incredible when he adds more Da Bomb sauce on his wing. Totally insane and hilarious - honestly I was shocked.
This was a good one, except him talking and food flying out of his mouth!!
The king of hot sauce!!!!!!!!!!
Conan is a beast
Conan the GOAT
This was a mess😂
Can’t wait for the Conan must go to drop!!!!!! Love Conan GOAT!!!!!
SPICE LORD 🙌
Conan did not disappoint 😂😂😂😂
So good!!
So happy to see Conan on this show ❤
Conan is not right!😂
The greatest Hot ones of all time 😂😂😂😂😂😂
He's Unhinged HAHAHAAHAHAHAHA
This is one my all time fav episodes!  Great job!!!
Conan could talk Flula Borg in to doing this show. I want to see him on here because he's already an energetic interviewee.
He gonna hate the bathroom tomorrow
May Conan live for another 100 years pls 🙏🏿
First good hot ones in a while
😂😂😂 Conan O’ Brien is a living legend. Funniest Late Night Show of all time. His improv and remotes are hilarious. For a split second, I thought he was trying to hard in the interview, and then it just got funnier and funnier. And then he masterfully admits he’s doing it for relevance for a younger audience in self deprecating humor. National Treasure.
He came, he saw, he conquered.
conan is such a perfect entertainer. thank you for all the much needed laughs you crazy Irish guy
Man if this is real..Conon is the new hot wing master..
BEST EPISODE OF HOT ONES...EVER!
Gotta be the best episode to date😂
The chicken Wing in Pocket gag is priceless
THE BEST EPISODE SO FAR!!! Conan is truly dedicated 110% risking his LIFE for THE SHOW!!
One of the best episodes ever.
This is a top 5 episode
😂😂😂😂😂😂 this was so hilarious from beginning to end 😂
My favorite one by far!!!!
The greatest episode ever!!! Conan’s the 🐐!!
He couldn't feel the spiciness because gingers have no soul
Conan hasn't lost one ounce of charisma in all these years. One of the best entertainers out there, great season finale *clap clap*.
Oh My GOD!!! Best episode ever!!! Conan is the GOAT.
Conan conquered
I guess dreams really do come true haha. Best season finale🔥
Yesssssss!!!!!! Love Conan
ABSOLUTE BEST HOT ONES EPISODE EVER
He’s a mad man that’s awesome
I got real worried when he opened his Da Bomb bottle. Thank god he didn't drink that one straight, we may have had our first hospitalization. At least there was a "doctor" on the scene.
I just watched this in an airport terminal. I was laughing hysterically. People stared, but I couldn't help it. This was so funny! Conan is the best!
Not gonna lie he made a complete fool of himself on this show. Acting like a child, this was actually embarrassing to watch
That Bomb wing really had me nervous and worried 😅
Best one so far :)
Never thought I’d see Conan going batshit insane eating hot wings but here we are.
it’s not an exaggeration to say that this is the best episode of all time
What a showman. He came on here with a mission and he accomplished his goal. A true legend.
what a showman!
I've never seen Conan so red, and that's saying something.
Spoiler alert: Conan is waaay taller than Sean!
the pale bouffanted 60 year old man of my dreams
Some people are just too good for this world. 🫡 Conan, another masterpiece!
He just pulled a The Joker. That’s crazy. Mixed with the comic book Joker. And honestly made all of us laugh. 🎉
Conan the barbarian
GOAT
Drank hit sauce 😂😂 what a beast
Best effin hot ones EVER!!! Goat
Conan's will power is amazing.
This is, without question, the best episode ever
Conan is God!
Oh man this is the best episode by far
Yes.
How can you top this episode?... You can't. I have always been a fan of Conan since the '90s but as a guest, he killed this performance. The best episodes so far are...  Episode Conan #1 Episode Dave Grohl #2
Vintage Conan. Best episode. Ever.
This is my favorite Hot Ones ever! Conan is an absolute savage 🔥
This is EASILY the best episode of Hot Ones. Period
I think this is it. This is the best we're gonna get from this show. Conan took it to the highest possible peak. He broke the game.
Ok ok ok ok…..let’s call it now.  Best episode ever.
the man
You know, just last week when I was again watching old Conan clips and newer clips from his podcast I started wondering if he's ever done the Hot Ones, I was gonna look it up but forgot. Imagine my surprise when I saw this pop up in my recommendations today, and uploaded only 4 hours ago
this was one of the best episodes yet.
Being willing to DIE for comedy... Conan is insane.
Love conan! My wife went to school with him and has pictures of him as a much much younger man!!!!
He transformed from a comfortable showman to a barbaric lunatic to the end. Amazing interview.
This was by far the best Hot Ones episode to date
I was so nervous it wasn't going to be a good episode. This is the best episode.
Well I guess the hot ones won't get any better at this point.  Conan was THE best one thus far.  100/10 A+++++
absolute commitment. absolute SAVAGE
CONAN IS A LEGEND!
every time Conan put a wing in his pocket, I cackled 🤣🤣🤣
THANK U
This was the best one
That is the best episode in YEARS
By far the best and funniest talk show host
"I HAVE A NEW SHOW..." with milk spilling out of his mouth.
without a doubt - The. Best. Guest. Ever.
CONAN IS THE DANGER
This was even better than I thought it would be. Solid 18 out of 10.
Did I watch Conan O'Brien die? 😅😅
BEST
Conan, original Tarja Halonen
His anecdote about the water buffalo was foreshadowing for what would happen later in the episode
He set the bar sooooo high. No one will be able to match. That last dab hurt me.
That was the most epic episode to date, i dont see anyone surpasing this!!!
I will never not love Conan O’Brien.
most fun one ever
This reminded me of the princess bride scene
Incredible. Almost threw up with Connan's final tirade. Couldn't keep my eyes off though.
MOST UNHINGED EPISODE EVER 😂 I love Conan so much ❤😂
This is peak Hot Ones, just shut it down boys, shut it down.
Legend
LETS GOOOOO
The best guest 100%.
OH MY GOD
Comedy royalty
Conan is the best.
Conan is an animal, and I loved every minute of this.
That was amazing
Redheads don’t feel pain….exhibit A, Conan on hot ones
This is one of those episodes you need an after show so we can see if he was able to live with his choices. LOLOL
This is definitely the most visceral episode
I mean come on….Conan rocked this.  Then destroyed it.  Then did it all again.  The best!
I died of laughter within the first two and a half minutes..
I have seen every episode. This one is the best.
“Max” rolls off the tongue because of Max Weinberg!
can we get DJ Khaled reacting to this episode?
That was peak entertainment, peak television
{STANDING ON A TABLE}  OH CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN...!!!
Best episode! Power rank it!
I love Conan but this was not it.
Never really watched his stuff before.. but he is funnier than I thought.
I've never been a Conan fan. Now, he has my genuine respect!
He made Eric Andre look tame
Warren G. Harding searches just exploded on Google
CONAN CURED MY DEPRESSION
One of my favorite parts is when I'm saying "Oh my God, Oh my god" and Sean Evans is also saying "Oh my god, Oh my god"
Best. Episode. Ever!
The Living Legend Conan. None could come closer.
Best lunch break ever. White whale guest right here!  GOOD GOD THIS WAS THE BEST HOT ONES EVER IT WILL NEVER BE TOPPED CONAN IS THE SPICIEST OF SPICE LORDS.
🫶
Best episode of hot ones ever. Conan is the goat🐐
I thought I would never watch this show again after Ice Spice then Conan brought me back.
It really says something that the two most unhinged guests this show has brought on have been Steve-O and a 60 year old Conan O'Brien. I have no idea what it says, but it surely says *something*
CONAN YOU ARE MY GOAT
conan I will tell you: kids loved this show and they will check it out!
Conan the most savage guest as of yet. I wonder if this will ever be topped.
GUY IS AN ABSOLUTE LEGEND ...TOP 3 INTERVIEW
Best episode ever!
This was the best hot one episode better than the gordon ramsey one. You can end it here no one will top this episode
Best interview for hot ones ever .
If his hair wasn’t already red, it certainly would have been after this! 🥵🔥
This might be my new favorite episode XD
Classic and it’s 4 hrs old
Shout out to Dr arroyo!
I think LSD is the only explanation other than Conan's god-like commitment to comedy
Best episode ever!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉
R.I.P. Conan it was a wild ride. The colors he must have seen.
This was easily one of the worst, most unhinged interviews this channel has ever seen. 10/10, can't wait to watch again.
Please please please bring Jimmy Kimmel and James Corden and Jim Carrey as guest, really love your show. Best interviews ever. Luv ur questions
AAAWOOO!!! AAAWOOO!!!
Conan's so right about Sean. Without his interviewing skills this show wouldn't have lasted a year.
Favorite hot ones episode ever! 😂😂😂😂
Best Episode EVER !!!!!!! Leno would Never come close !!!!
Best guest EVER!
This lit my stomach on fire, just watching it
Wow, the sheer vital energy it took Conan to do this... hilarious, it was like story slowly building up😂😂😂
I was just on a conan rabbit hole these past few days and I literally yelped when I saw this
Conan's Nixon impression at 17:55 has me crying 😂
Literally going to get a sub to MAX for Conan. We love ya you big red freak!
Hilarious!!!! Love Conan and Sean!!! 🤣
Conan is the freaking best!!!
I didn't believe the comments that said CHAOS. 😳 But Chaos indeed. 10/10
Tonight, a few hours after this show's taping, the city engineers are going to have to visit Conan's neighbourhood to reconstruct the sewage system that's been blown to smithereens.
Conan O'Brien = Baldur from God of War game. D
I love him so much it’s not even funny
I love conan so much 😭
Team Coco for life, he's just amazing! But it did get gross at the end.
WOW!!! Maybe The Best Hot Ones Ever? Conan was literally and figuratively on FIRE!!! I have seen every Hot Ones episode and have never seen anything like this! I mean who dares douse themselves with The Bomb!?!?! And then keep taking it to higher levels?!? INSANE IN THE MEMBRAIN!?! Conan is the G  O  D!
Why does he look like Bryan Cranston's little brother at the end there?
Greatest episode ever
"The Last Dab"? Scratch that. Introducing "The Last Drench"!
You see the blood rise in Conan's eyes....
🐐
I really assumed Max Weinberg every time he said it.
I've sent hundreds of funny comments on this show and  might get one like  for it. Then see everyone else get thousands of likes...so I'll just say this show was hot. Now feel free to make me feel unseen
This was absolutely entertaining! Conan is a nut lol
Now I want that jacket
Conan is a GD legend!
Legendary plug at the end. THIS is how you market.
Conan 2024! Im writing him in on my ballot.
my favorite moment is when we start the show and end it with Conan. Best guest ever, correction BEST HOT ONES LEGEND EVER!
savage! best episode so far ;p
This episode was absolutely hysterical 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That ... was phenomenal, never knew he was such a lad.
Conan is the greatest of all time. Gold.
he is gonna hate his next doo-doo
I loved Sean's reaction as much as I sooo loved Conan in this. The look in Sean's eyes.
That was the best 😅
I knew before I clicked this that it might be one of the best episodes ever recorded. Conan is GOATed.
Well its a proven fact redheads have higher pain tolerance and often need more anesthesia lol
Conan officially won this show!
A SAVAGE
Holy. Best guest ever.  How many times has Conan had COVID to loose his taste? 🧐 😅
Conan is such a legend hahahahaha
Did the doctor go to Hollywood Upstairs Medical College?
👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Best episode of the series, tied to the one with Eric Andre breaking a plate on his head.
Excellent... Just excellent
Epic so happy to see Conan.. Only late night host i ever watched consistently
Ou Wau, Conan. Thanks Mila Kunis. Conan smoked Paul Rudd totally. Awesome!!!
Absolute Legend
When Conan commits, he commits! Respect! Those sauces ain't no joke, and he powered through like a champ without fumbling a single word. Amazing. Two of the great interviewers of their time.
Holy Jesus that was so funny!!
My 33 years of life has finally led to this moment, Conan on Hot Ones. I'm now complete.
Conan took it like a pro.
What a beast!
Conan is so effing funny
Conan is the GOAT
Is doctor arroyo supposed to be a reference to doctor nick 😂
We don't deserve Conan! No one is better than Conan.
This is the best hot ones episode of all time. Thanks Conan and Sean! And team
My favorite episode
Absolute savagery.
curtain!!!! iykyk 💜
Conan is such an icon. Sitting here thinking about how long ive watched him is intense. I remember in the late 90s being in elementary school watching his late night show. And here he is, 25 years later, still on top of his game.
jokes on us, he has covid   JK IDK
This was fantastic. Would love to see Billie Eilish return, especially with her new album about to drop
I love how Conan is able to wholly embrace what would otherwise cause most people the most profound embarrassment, not only because he knows it will make other people laugh but because he knows if he were a witness to it, it would make him laugh.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼
Best episode EVER!!!
I can't tell if this is the best or worst episode of this show ever. But it's definitely one or the other.
Been waiting for this one since the beginning of the show! The only two hosts I'd actually want to talk with if I were a celebrity.
u say max  ... i think cinemax  ... so there haha
lol he went full Albert Brooks
Who the heck needs Conan The Barbarian when you got Conan O'brien over here bathing in hot sauce literally.
and there will officially never be an episode greater than this
How is this even possible?!
LEGENDARY
That was the best episode ever
Best episode yet!!! Conan is hilarious!
Best. Episode. Ever. Conan and Sean would make a great host/cohost thing.
Comedy gold.
This has to be one of the greatest episodes yet. Just pure, unhinged madness at the end. Loved it.
😂😆😂
You have no IDEA how much I needed a laugh like that. Thank you very much gentlemen. ❤
This is the first time I've seen our boy Sean unable to keep up with a guests pace and energy. I think Conan almost died.
wow i honestly think this the goat hot ones ep for me... unbeliavable. i laughed the whole time!
Hot Ones hall of fame performance.  No one will ever meet the challenge the way Conan did this episode.  Glad to have witnessed it.  Hot Ones may have just jumped the shark.
Conan is hilarious
Im literally dying this is the best episode they have ever done. Ive never laughed so hard
This is History in the making 😂
Legend😂
Looking forward to Conan's reaction 5 days from now when he starts noticing a stench from his jacket pocket.
talking with food in mouth, on lips, spit....yeaaaaa to much for me. But he is a genius.
THAT WAS THE BEST HOT ONES!! I LAUGHED NON-STOP THROUGH IT!! I CRINGED, I CRIED, I LAUGHED AND LOVED THIS!!!  IT WAS THE BEST, SEAN AND CONAN ROCKED THIS!!!
he looked like arnold schwarzenegger in total recall when his head is exploding lol
Where did you go to school “Yes” 💀💀💀💀 I die right there
Funniest episode yoooooooo 🤣🤣🤣🤣
hes a monster
one of the funniest hot ones yet! literally made me cry of laugh, pure genius!
🥵
"yeah he's...not good" 😂
This is the best impression I've ever seen of Robin Williams when he was coked out in the Eighties.
The Doctor 😭😭😭
Conan needs to Stay!!
The best.
conan with mini skits with his doctor. so good. love these guys
Conan Is GOAT
Out of state😂
Conan and Sean together is legendary
No way you got Conan! Wow!
Might as well give up now. This was your magnum opus. No going up from here. Awesome work 😆
I am not going to ever be convinced those sauces were real at the end there, "sealed" or not. Words at some point become difficult when you can't feel your lips.
I fricking love Conan haha Also the best advertisement I've ever seen for any streaming service. Max it is!
I'm simple. I see Conan, I click
Conan is amazing. He is a legend and just made the best episode of this show.
Conan O'Brien was already The GOAT of Late Night (Sorry Carson) But he's now The Hot Ones GOAT of Guest.
Conan is like the best real Simpson character!love watching him and his passion about jokes like bringing his Dr.! And he does it with so much style and fun! ❤
Conan best guest yet.
Cheese and crackers 😂
he won I don't know what. but he won hot ones.
Crying laughing
Finally… someone eating wings the way they were meant to be consumed 😅
Conan is GOATED
conans the only old man i've ever had a crush on
This was chaotic 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭
This is insane on so many levels and we are all here for it
I cried laughing at this.
The doctor looks familiar....
End the show. It can't get better than this
Crying with laughter. Conan is BAE GOAT.
Legend, this one goes right into the books!
No one can top this! 🤣
HE IS ACTUALLY INSANE
The greatest to ever do it
Conan taking tuggs off the hot sauce bottle tho.
Craig Ferguson needs to be on hot ones!
The temperature reading was funny, but would also be an interesting stat to show on screen. Throw in a heart rate monitor for kicks.
He's the best 🎉🎉🎉🎉
The Irish are the Mexicans of Europe and Conan just proved it. 🌶️
Legendary.
That was a RIDE the host looked afraid for his life! 😂
I’ve watched Conan my whole life. My dad was a huge Simpsons & SNL fan, and we watched Conan daily since his debut on Late Night. I’ve been waiting for this episode, and man did it not disappoint! Favorite episode by far!!
"Audiences wanna see a good show, they wanna see a good interview"   Conan comes to hot ones busting the door down knowing this fact and fully commiting. What an incredible episode.
Conan is the goat
I just woke up and saw this on my feed and thought I was dreaming... the day finally has come... why take more than a decade for this to happen.............................................
Conan is either completely insane, or an absolute G. I haven't decided which yet.
Why people think that Conan is funny is a mystery to me.  I find him annoying and whiny.  To each their own I suppose. Sean’s laughter seemed forced and polite.
The concern on Sean's face at 22:38 is all of us.
He referred to “Letterman and… the other one.” Don’t even give Leno the benefit of saying his name. TEAM COCO!!
Shawn's so vanilla. Conan stands on Business
When Conan went for the extra pours and licks on Da Bomb... I literally gasped.
This is why Conan O'Brien will stand the test of time and come out as an exemplary figure for the future generation.
9 more season morty. Rick and morty forever a hundret years
Best Hot Ones ever!!!
"a wise and stable man." 😆😆
Bar none the best interview I have ever seen!
Conan is a master, some of the most inspired insanity of all time.
Well, now we have proof. Conan is insane.
IIIIIII’M FIIIINE!!   😂😂😂😂
In the end, Conan is really DA BOMB
Legendary❤😂
I’m exhausted now. Long live Conan
Ok, that earns a like
People who don’t like Conan, are just haters for no good reason.
the greatest EP ever! CONAN RULERS!
CONAN NEVER DISAPPOINTS
3:17 Max is inferior in every way. The app got worse and it’s full of a bunch of Discovery junk
Steve O is going to have to come back to reclaim his crown. 😂😂
Already one of the most legendary epsiodes on this show. Conan is a gem.
BEST ONE.
👍🏻
Conan with the "oh billy moment" 💀💀💀😂😂
Hands down the BEST EPISODE IN HISTORY
Biden prepped Conan with some of his State of the Union stuff.
Wow. Just WOW.
The eldritch god of Hot Ones guests
Finally!! Thank you
Much better guest than Ice Spice
This is the best interview so far
Best host ever!
I haven't laughed this hard at a youtube video in a very long time 🤣🤣🤣
I have never seen Sean so unnerved and shocked and surprised. Wow
GREAT SEASON FINALE! No one will top CONAN!!!!! Carson. Letterman and CONAN. End of the list!
One of the best 27 minutes of my life. Thank you!
Mic drop indeed. Conan, take a bow.
Hope either John Candy or Jordan Schlansky are mentioned.
Haven't laughed this hard in a long time. Thank you Conan, and thank you First We Feast.
One of the best ones I've seen. Hilarious.
Classic Conan! ❤❤
I had no idea Conan was such a beast! Mad respect.
The G.O.A.T.
This reminded me that I could only take Conan in small doses! Dude is a beast but too much for me
The man is certifiable.
This is hands down the best episode of hot ones ever. Can I give this about 100 more likes?
Conan 'The deranged lunatic of hot sauce' O'brien
That's it - this is it. It's the best Hot Ones episode that will ever exist. There have been some great ones but this one right here. Unbelievable.
My GERD cringed when he drank the hot sauce 😅
Conan is the best guest of this show by far
Dude Conan's teeth turned yellow during da bomb
He is just impressive!
Man, Conan really will do anything when you point a camera at him. 😂
Conan!
What an incredibly tame & relaxed interview.
My goodness I am eating wings tonight
Now you have to get Sona
Best ever 👀👍
Lol everything Conan does is brilliant. The man is a beast lol. He bathed on the sauce lol
This was absolutely the best episode 😂😂😂😂😂 I love Conan😂😂😂😂
He's just loud. Not my sense of humour.
TRULY JUST LOVE CONAN... CANT SAY MORE. I THINK HE IS A COMEDIC LEGEND AND I AM IMPRSSED BY HIS COMEDIC TIMING. ALWAYS.
Legend!
I knew this would be so good and it was!  I love Conan.
Conan is a Madman
THIS IS THE EPISODE. No one has ever done it like Conan. Always thought he was funny. Now I have to go and watch anything he's on just for this performance. Comedy is King
Well, that escalated quickly.
Axl Rose next!
I'm so proud of how far this show has come
I don't normally watch this show, but with Conan on it, I had to watch. Nice.
Despite his act, he starts turning red at 9:40 so you know it's getting to him.
the goat.
Best episode ever!!!
what a legend!
LEGEND
EPIC from start to finish! If this is not the BEST EPISODE IN HISTORY is a top 3 easily. Agree?
Conan is by far one of the greatest comedic minds of all time. As much as he likes to dunk on himself, he really is one of the funniest people out there. If we wonder why the podcast ends mysteriously, it will be because Conan overdosed on hot sauce
Ha bad idea Conan. Great show!
I literally laughed out loud…hard, the last 4 wings. Best episode, ever!💪🏾🤘🏾
I NEED to see The Lonely Island on Hot Ones someday. All three of them together. I can't imagine anything more entertaining.
Conan fully took this interview over and sean is so happy
What a legend
Just love it! ❤
This exceeded the hype
Best Hot Ones episode ever.
Best one ever!❤😂
I never thought we'd see anything that could get Conan's skin to match his hair - crazy
it's just so weird watching him turn into donald trump.
i've never clicked so fast in my life
Conan's king!
The Dr Arroyo bit is fantastic 😂
😂😂😂😂 i haven't laughed this hard watching an interview in a long time
Liking the video before even playing it because I know it's gonna be great! Love Conan!
Dang Conan!  You can handle pain....great video.nice season ending..keep rockin.
Based guest. Conan is the best talk show host ever.
This is honestly a perfect hot ones episode.
This one is one f e best
What a GLORIOUS episode. my god
The greatest!
Conan O'Brien taking over... crazy !
This can’t be real?! Oh my gosh 😂
"Are You Not Entertained?!!" Conan is a true gladiator enslaved by his own comic genius.
This is the craziest episode ever! A true Classic!! Conan is the new King of Spices!!
Ok, this is officially my new favourite episode of Hot Ones
Tabasco
GREAT EPISODE
Absolutely legendary.
Good luck to anyone trying to beat Conan's performance against the wings because holy bleeping blorp did he make that look easy.
TIL Conan has that REALLY strong taste-killing COVID
I hope he talks about this on his podcast! 🤣❤️
I had no idea that I was waiting for this all along. F yes.
AMAZING !!!!
This was awesome
Conan the Conquerer
G.O.A.T.
I cant tell if Conan is great with hot food or if his sheer will power for comedy protected him
The best guest yet. Conan is a legend and doesn't disappoint. This is entertainment!
Dude legendary!
My new favorite episode. Can't wait for his new show!
Wonder if some people are immune to capsaicin?
dayum conan u have issues brother ?  Can you not shut nor wipe your mouth !? Is that how midlife crisis be like?
He put his stethoscope on Sean's tongue. 😆😆
Conan really took over and made it his own.  Love that about him
Talk about commitment.  Conan is the best.  And now he’ll spend the next 3 days in the hospital.
That was a fantastic interview, Conan you are the man, did not disappoint and I had high expectations!
why are the tables like 10 feet apart?
OOOOO MMMYY GODDDDDD
27 minutes of pure comedy, Conan truly is the GOAT!
amazing !
After John Oliver this is absolute perfection. We're getting Legends here ladies and gentlemen
That man is a legend.  The commitment to pure show biz.  What a treat.
Mayonnaise is too spicy for Conan
That was a classic.
Absolutely the best episode of this show.
Best episode ever!
Peak
Conan went a little Grandpa Rick there at the end. Lol.
I've said it once, I'll say it again... Conan O'brien would've made a GREAT Joker in the Batman universe!
Woah
How's my pulse? Dr. Arroyo: "Yup, it's there"
Jesus!      You said it, man. Nobody f'ks with the Jesus.
I might die laughing before Conan dies of hot sauce
I don't know how much pain Conan felt but I think I felt it for him watching that.
OK I did not have Warren G Harding on my bingo card....
Reindeer are domesticated, caribou are wild
you need to bring in David Goggins
Now I wanna see David Letterman or Stephen Colbert on here
THANKYOU CONAN 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
OMFG!!! Conan... sooo pumped to watch this!
Legend
That was so great!!!!!  Conan delivers a top 10 performance!!!!
Simply the best. Full stop.
I hurt so much from laughing. I hope his oesophagus has not disintegrated.
Conan is an absolute LEGEND in this vid, man eats the spiciest sauces like its nothing, delivers every joke perfectly, spits some mad wisdom, just absolute insanity and it may or may not be the top guest for Hot Ones in terms of heat durability. Best episode since Gordon Ramsey and Shaq!
Conan is the GOAT!
Hands down the best performance, best guest, best episode. This might as well be the series finale. There is no topping this.
As much has The Simpsons predicted future events, Conan O'Brian wrote a lot of the material.  I really think Conan can predict the future. I really thought Sean was going to ask about that.
whooooaaa!! that was nuts!!! i feel like i've just had a very short acid trip
Besides Conan looking like he needs to fire his makeup artist, this did not end up how I thought it would.
Can we all agree Conan was the best one?!
I'm a little bit scared
Protect this man at all costs
Sean please stop the corona split 🤮 bring back the one table. It makes the interview more personal ❤
this is the best hotones episode ever.
This is the best episode ever hahaha
Golden!
Bruh... Is he alive?
Most unhinged episode I've seen since Eric Andre! Conan O'Brian, you are a legend!
Best guest accolade just got stolen by Conan
Okay, even Sean impressed me, because I've always wanted to know what talk show host do when they lean in towards the guest to cut to break.
Man doesn’t miss a beat
Dude this episode is so f funny and reminds us why Conan is the goat
Legendary! or he's dead insead and it's a cry for help! XD
This is the greatest thing I’ve ever seen
I havent enjoyed conan for some time but this was hilarious and wild
I loved every second of this until 26:21 when I found out this is a ButtFeed production.
I haven’t seen anyone this braggadocios since the Late Great Coolio
EPIC!!!!!!!!
What else can you say... Conan is a beast!
You missed an opportunity to say “careful around the eyes” as he rubbed his faced in hotsauce Sean 😂
Best episode ever. Can’t imagine how cool it must be to interview a personal hero and legend like Conan. Priceless
That went exactly as I'd imagined 😅. You know he's dying while doing his bits. Probably spent 3 days in the can 😊
Conan is a national treasure
OMFG! That was Epically Insane Funny. BEST EP YET!
Epic.
Conan. Popeye. Gandhi.
🔥Conan Da’ Bomb🔥
man took da bomb and licked it off like it was nothing😂
I for real have a bottle of ta  bomb in the kitchen, I don't get how that man eats it like that… for real. i got it in my ear once, it burned! Like w*f
He must have borrowed the jacket from Jordan and he can not WAIT to give it back to him.
I love and miss Conan on tv every night.
This is probably my favorite episode of Hot Ones ever.
Best episode of this series ! Conan knows what he’s doing !
The best episode yet!  Sean is a fantastic interviewer, and Conan is a crazy old man! This had me crying and laughing all at the same time! I didn't realize how much I had missed seeing Conan on TV till today
BEST SHOW TO DATE
Honestly why can I only upvote once. Just WOW!
Conan is the ronin of late night. He travels from format to format and when called upon he responds with deep cuts of comedy.
I think his face went numb because he was covered in food and sauce
It might be time to retire the show now and go out on a high!! This episode is clearly the peak. Conan is king.
You can officially end the show here. No need for more seasons. This episode will not be topped. Legend.
Best episode ever.
Best episode of Hot Ones ever!
I’m so excited that Conan is on! Team Coco forever!❤
This the new bar. Conan slayed the wings of death
This is one of my favorite episodes of all time
All time great!
I love how he sticks with the wings in the pocket bit and then brings in the bit with the doctor to continue the wings in the pocket bit. Comedy genius!
oh my god. this is the peak of entertainment history!
OK, where can the show go from here ? This was bonkers!
Best guest ever. I'm in tears.
I love how Da Bomb isn’t the hottest but is the one that most guest admit to being the biggest regret of their career. 😂
I really think, this was the best episode of them all. Never laughed so much.
Conan goat
Un-F’n-Hinged
Gordon’s episode was the most satisfying. Conan’s is the most impressive. Both equally the funniest
He is disintegrating in front of our eyes.
Conan is the anti-Khalid
I'm a simple dude. I see Conan on Hot Ones, I press thumbs up. What an episode!
TIL I have the same birthday as Conan O'brien!
Conan the goat
Conan has always been my favorite.. do yourself a favor a watch the kevin nealon podcast clips. They will have you in stiches. This was hands down the best Hot Ones episode ever!!! Not even close!
Yyeeeeeeh
Perfectly chaotic Conan.
OH MY GOD !!!!! BEST HOT ONES TO THIS DAY... Conan is a SAVAGE !!!!!
His face red
That was absolutely brilliant.
This got me so fired up!!!!!
Conan is the best of the best. There is no one like Conan was in that talk show industry.
21 minutes in, Sean _still_ hasn't said anything about "watch the eyes and skin". Is this a new record? Maybe he just knew you don't fw the Conan.  Edit: He never told him, but he did tell him to watch out for the jacket💀
Dropping everything for Conan hot ones
Best guest act of the year!! Feeling live again after watching the interview
Finally Conan is here. I've not watched this channel in a while but immediately I saw Conan, I clicked it so fast and he didn't disappoint.
Conan took over the whole thing😭🤣
When celebrities are stuck "on" it gets really weird. Some comics made it work, like Robin Williams, but Conan is not Robin.
Wow!!
This is the greatest 27 minutes of television ever created.
Conan went to Harvard wrote  for snl the Simpsons and was a talk show host for years to see him still killing it and showing his brilliance of comedy makes me to believe only he can eat hotass wings without fumbling a word the calculated Conan made this a episode to rewatch and watch for decades to come cheers to Conan and I don’t feel bad for the toilet
Best hot ones episode yet! I’m still in shock at how he handled da bomb!
Conan brought Intensity that Tom Cruise wished he had during Oprah......
Alright I'll watch an episode of his show
I’ve never seen Sean look this scared and genuinely concerned for a guest’s mental health lolol
Conan, effin chill!!!
Is he the first guy to officially beat Da Bomb or got close to it?
Literally the best episode ever.
This was 100% worth the wait. Conan by name, Conan (of the wings) by nature.
legend
LEGENDARY!!! Conan, that was glorious.
He asked the Doc to check his pulse and he goes "its there"  🤣🤣
The more hot sauce you get into him, the wilder he gets 🤣 He’s the best.
That's definitely got to be the first wing drop, 🍗 and the first wing in the pocket of the show! 😆
Hands down the most fun I've had watching! 😂
I like he won't even say Leno's name. "The other guy" lol.
I'm in tears laughing! Didn't think anything would top Gordon Ramsay, and here come Conan, well done! Round 2 with his crew?
My eyeballs are sweating, watching this! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🥵
Just wow 😂
GOAT
Conan is one of the greatest and will always be
You guys did it. that was the best episode.
What an episode!!! Amazing.
When Dr Arroyo checks his pulse and says “it’s there” I died ⚰️
Funniest one ever!
There is no point of this show anymore. Lifetime achievement unlocked.
Now THAT is a good episode!!
EPIC😂😂😂😂😂
Im not doing a mic drop - it's a wing drop!
Is it just me, or does this feel like you're watching your boss do stand up and you're laughing only out of respect.
Memorable on so many levels
First Wing Drop😂
The GOAT!
This has got to be the most Insane Hot Ones I've seen. Conan is the only talk show host I enjoy.
10/10, thanks for a great season
It’s been awhile since Sean’s had a legitimately insane guest on, and you could tell he’d gotten a bit rusty with trying to keep pace. Absolutely hilarious episode!
Conan is the absolute best at everything he touches and this is literal proof. How the whitest man I have ever seen can give the most impressive performance at eating hot sauce is beyond me.
I would definitely tear up if I received praise like that from Conan. I guess he was right in a way in the beginning 😅
🐐
"You can't predict the future" says man who predicted Bea Arthur's death
hands down best episode of hot ones
Conan graduated from Harvard. 😅 it takes a smart man to be so funny.
That was an excellent "Wing Drop".
The true definition of a showmen!!!! This men never doesn’t disappoints.
My favorite hot ones interview of all time. I love Conan.
Wipe your face you’ll melt!!!!🤣
This was everything you needed in a hot ones video!
Pure chaos
Legendary.
CONAN FINALLY MADE IT ON TO HOT ONES 😁🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
This might be the best episode to date
1:56 Dr Arroyo, he’s not the best, but he’s affordable 😂
About time.
I love you Conan
Awesome show!
Conan turned to Lewis Black at the end!
I think the spice may have got to him
😂😂 “you can’t stop me from being me, I have to give everything 110%”  -sincerely a full send Aries
This is GOLD. Good job Shawn! It's been fun to watch the channel grow over the years!
I had neer heard of Conan before. I'm from the U.K. But I will DEFINATELY  check out his stuff now.  THAT WAS THE FUNNIEST EPISODE EVER.
An incredible interview, love you both and the teams behind it all! ❤❤
"What's wrong with me? Why can't I FEEL?" oh wow I'm dying
16:40 probably one of the legendary moments on the show
Leave it to Conan to bring in a whole extra actor for a bit during an interview
There hasn't been and never will be a greater Hot Ones interview ever...
Awesome. just awesome.
Bravo!
Ok good show but where is Sona?  Or is she supposed to eat the leftovers ins someone's pocket?  Or is Matt blessed with them?
I feel this is as close as we could get to seeing the late Dennis Hopper on hot ones
Not just the greatest host but the greatest guest
Best one yet
Best episode ever, hands down, Conan is just magic
I haven't had this much fun since Stackenblocken!!!
Holy dear jesus, was he literally unfazed or the commitment to the bit is THAT strong?
Conan is top 5 in this show! Great performance and comedy. His answers were amazing and detailed, loved it so much!
This is by far my favorite
I will never forget Conan’s legendary visit to the Korean spa with Steven Yeun. So many one liners from that live rent free in my head. “They took my skin and now I want to sleep forever.”
Went from a comedy genius to a borderline lunatic within 4-5 mins. 🐐
YEEEESSSSSSSS
just love conan
Best episode. Peak comedy.
This has to be the best episode ever :D
F#&%@ yeah!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is a Magnum Opus🥹
The best!!
Series over. You can't top that.
I think Conan would make a great Rick
LEGEND
Bro put the wing in his pocket.
Was this interview Da Bomb?😂
"I've never seen a spice until I was about 52 years old".
Conan did old school comedy, hollywood, late night, all of em JUSTICE. I know my mother would be very pleased with this episode.
One of the best.
Bro get Rick Astley on here. His "Are we there yet" album is fantastic and he has such a wonderful story in music.
Yes!! Thank you!!! CONAN WE LOVE YOU!!!!!!!! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Talk about raising the bar for next season.
Conan needs to get his own late night show again... it's a crime not having him on one.
This might be the funniest episode (and messiest episode) of Hot Ones yet... and no one can argue that Conan went in 100%.  If he survives/recovers, we'll have to find out if he actually got to really taste any of it.  While certainly not the first guest to get through all the wings, Conan might have been one of the most excited guests to consume them all.  😁
I wish Andy was with him instead of the "doc"
the new king of spice
Legend 🧡
Best episode yet lol Conan is next level
Nobody will ever top Conan o Brian by eating the whole wing and saturate it as well!. Champ!
Best one EVER 😂😂😂😂
Love you Conan!!!!
If you didn't directly google "Conan O'Brien water buffalo" after watching this then we are not cut from the same cloth
This was THE best hot ones. Conan cant be beat
😂😂😂😂😂 conan did not disappoint 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conan, brought it
I think Conan is self aware of the value of his punishment, and self inflicts it as a faithful servant of the audience. Its sad watching someone torture themselves for their own accomplishments. I feel like im watching some kind of historical event like a walk of shame. Idk how I feel about walks of shame.
This was as far away from an Ice Spice episode as you can possibly get.
Best guest hands down
This is what "legendary" looks like. Its going to be so hard for anyone to top this. Probably no one will.
A worthy season finale, maybe the best guest and episode so far. Conan is a mad genius.
Conan's incredible. first time in his life he probably had color on his skin other than pale.
Oh my god !!!   The BEST
team coco! glad to see him on the show! 😊
Oh how I love Conan 🤣
The best entertainer in the business, and hands down the funniest talk show host by miles🔥🔥🔥
I love Conan....   what a guy.....
Sean thinks he's smart but yes cringey
Whatever the show is, Conan's gonna step it up a notch, or 50! 👏😯
22:24 Just more proof the last dab is no where near the scoville levels they claim it to be.
My God! U got to love Conan. Best final ever. ❤
LEGENDARY
Im a bit scared of Conan now
this is the pinnacle of show business. conan is the goat.
Conan’s last few wings forced me to turn the brightness down on my phone while being on the train
Wow this is unexpected
icon
Best late night host to the best hot ones guest!
Outstanding 😂
I want Conan to give Sona these wings. She ROCKS!
That was the absolute best episode ever!!!
Conan O'Brien bringing in a doctor to check his temperature......him putting the finished wings in his pocket?!? I can't with him 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
best ep ever
best episode till date
Who is that pale lady and why is she drinking hot sauce?
I haven't watched an episode of hot ones in a while but had to come back for coco
Last but most certainly not the least of any seasons of hot ones.  Seriously though who brings their own "doctor "?😅😅😅
What an utter beast! Gorgeous! Unique!
that man is committed
"I am who I am". - Popeye
I love how this is a rare episode where Sean doesn’t mirror everything his guest does because Conan is so absurd. 😂
this is goated 🙌
Conan going nucleur with the hot sauces like Coolio did back in the day.
best ep ever
This one was the absolute best!!! 😍😍
Conan’s lips are so inflamed you can almost see them.
I never leave comments, but all I can say is that was legendary.
13:39 thru 14:10 16:44 thru 17:05 20:52 thru 21:25 Three of the most EPIC scenes in the history of the show! Nothing tops that. (I don't even want to imagine the burning that Conan felt on his lips at the end.)
Funniest man alive.
The goat.
Needed 10 more minutes! 😂😂😂
Peak
The best one yet!
I miss him so much
Conan almost killed Sean :D Conan is precious man... true diamond of human kind!
No ducking way. I love Conan!!
I've always loved Conan.
PLEASE tell me the water buffalo incident is on YouTube!
I have to agree with a lot of others, this was probably the greatest episode I've seen. Almost busted a gut laughing so hard... This show is so consistently entertaining and engaging. Thank you!
I am speechless. How awesome is Conan on this episode. I am feeling the hot stuff from in UK and he is drinking it down like a fine wine. 🤩 🤩 ❤❤😂😂
Wow, never heard about him sitting at Letterman's desk during the SNL years. That might have had some type of manifestation or sympathetic magick type effect on him eventually getting the job, which did seem like a long shot.
I love Conan 😂
"The other guy" lol
Love this dude :)
Conan the Barbarian. Absolute Legend.
I do enjoy watching this show.. but now that I think of... I have never cracked my self up laughing out loud while watching one episode. Why is Conan inmune to spyiness? is it because he is a red head? ...does not having a soul makes you not feel pain? I've heard red heads do not have souls.
Nobody is  beating Conan 😂 🔥
Conan is an animal
If this dropped next week it would have been on Conan's birthday.
Someone WHEEZED when Doc put the stethoscope on Sean's tongue 😂
First time I am seeing someone get high on tabasco...🤣🤣
“What’s wrong with me why can’t I feel?”
Maybe my new favorite episode of the series. Conan is a beast
ABSOLUTE LEGENDARY 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I kinda want to rewatch the DJ Khaled one now, just for some contrast xD
What an interview
Now that's entertainment!
Respect!
Conan for Humanity!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
awesome!
Best epsidoe ever
Conan is the best guest ever!
I cried laughing.   Best episode  in awhile!
I think Russell Brand just got topped…
Conan is THE MAN!!!!
This was insane. Conan the Pepperian, setting a new bar for madness with the hot sauce. Since it wasn't mentioned, Conan O'Brien was also an editor on National Lampoon, one of the funniest magazines ever made, and a producer and writer on the Simpsons. Full comedy legend.
I 100000000000000000000000000% thought he would never do this Im beyond happy ❤❤❤
I'm no-one but I eat the bones. Rwooof!
Literally the best episode ever. I've waited all my life for this. @teamcoco can turn any bad day around
Watching this, I feel like I need my doctor
Gordon Ramsay did everything in his power to dull the pain. Conan did everything in his power to embrace it. A true Spice Lord.
the best episode ever 😂
Conan is doing everything in his might to make it to the top 10 memorable moments list. 😂
🐐🐐🐐
Never have i clicked on an episode so fast! This was hands down the most gross but spectacular episode on Hot ones😂 so excited to watch his new travelling content he's the OG❣
Holy snot, I never thought I'd see the day, and not a single mac and me reference to be seen.
I love how this is basically the Ramsay episode, but cranked to the exact opposite extreme xD
Best episode ever.❤
This has to be my all-time favorite episode! You're my hero Conan! There is no favorite moment, the whole thing was amazing.
actually the BEST episode hahahahaha
One of the best yet
HAHAHAHAHA
Sean usually follows suit with whatever the guest does. Dude did not even consider chugging the La Pimenterie.
Is Shawn doing everything too???? Good lord lol this is the best
This is the greatest episode of Hot Ones ever! Conan is a beast!!
HILARIOUS 🤣🤣
All the people in the comments saying this cant be recreated......you are 100 percent correct
His body temp went up 2 degrees!  What a monster.
holy jesus christ. Conan is a super human. licking da bomb? was this staged...
God I love Conan. His ability to flow between bits and seriousness is genuinely paralleled
Never had HBO, never had Max, but I'll be signing up for the first time when the travel show drops. That's how much I like Conan. But today, I realized behind all his antics, Conan is a tough and courageous guy!
Finally, a hot ones I care about this season;)
Conan has set the bar,best ever!
Conan went to Harvard xD
This one is for the History Books. What a legendary episode.
GOAT
Probably the best yet
Excellent episode!!  Now go get Keanu Reeves :0)
Is Conan coming back?
I love Conan. Huge fan here. Cheers from Denmark
Teamcoco forever
Best episode yet!
This was one of the best episodes ever. Conan is crazy af, and I can't imagine the clean up, lol.
"The other guy..." DEAD.
Watching this while eating my lunch was a mistake. But it may have been the funniest thing I've seen this year
Someone show this to DJ Khaled.  He'll never be this cool.
The man just does not disappoint.
Yuo can stop the show now. It's over. Turn the lights out, cancel the internet service.
This is in my Mt. Rushmore of the Hot Ones!
"...a Charlie Rose show where you eat hot wings" 🤣💯
Breaking news, Conan O'Brien face melts off after staring on first we feast you tube channel. Hair comes out unscathed tho.
LISAN AL GAIB!!!!🙏🙏🙏
This is amazing. I am fully convinced that Conan sat at home prior to the interview, terrified because of his low tolerance for heat and afraid to die without a doctor nearby. But he has this crazy determination and ability somehow to take his own neurotic fears and turn them completely on their head for comedy's sake. And I know that he has been doing stuff like this for almost forty years now, but it still amazes me how much he is willing and capable to endure for a good show.
Jesus. Conan will always be a legend. Funniest man alive!
Conan got high on the hot sauce that's the funniest thing I've ever seen  he gave me so much stress watching this
You got three in there... that's what she said…
“Charlie Rose show where you eat hot wings” of man that’s a spot on comparison lol
Thank god for Conan
OMGAWD!!!!!  This was the FUNNIEST First We Feast EVER!!! 🔥😅🔥😅🔥😅🔥😅🔥😅🔥😅🔥😅🔥😅🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😂
This is my favourite guy!
THE BEST HOT ONES EVER!!!!!!!
This episode was like a cool drink of water after a 4-day long music festival. The last few episodes have been hot garbage so this is refreshing 😅
We know he's got the guts to eat hot sauce. This guy goes on holiday in a war zone (Haiti).
Best episode yet!
Okay, keeping them in your pocket for later is original
The only you will break Conan is if Jordan Schlansky was there answering the questions while Conan ate wings .  Love Jose got incorporated
Dear God Conan. I expected nothing less
Conan is the GOAT. Good God!!!
And that folks, is how you end a season! 👏🏽👏🏽
Okay, well, that went well... 🤣
Legendary
This is everything. Conan remains king of all.
The rightful heir to the Tonight Show throne.
Too hilariously funny!🤣😂🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Amazing job, Conan!!!😍😍👏👏
I think he just beat David Blane, or at least is very close
That’s it. Hot Ones should gracefully end right here. No one will ever top this. Conan just annihilated every single wing, without hesitation.
Never commented on Youtube, probably never will, but THIS ist the best Hot Ones there will ever be! *wing drop*
I was expecting him to go crazy, but not this crazy. Best guest without a doubt
I love Conan
My alltime favorite ep 😂
That was one of tbe most chaotic interviews I ever seen 😭😭
Just when you think you've seen the best of Hot Ones, Conan shows up and absolutely OBLITERATES all other Hot Ones guests. A++
surprised at how much hot sauce he can handle
The wing drop 🤣🎤🍗
I can't believe Conan actually dabbed extra Bomb. Has it even ever been done before?
That three stooges reference is amazing. Loved watching them.
Please made a B-roll episode of just Sean's camera uncut.
YES YES YES CONAN CONAN CONAN!!!!!
Am I the only one shocked not to have seen an obituary after this episode that said, “Conan O’Brien passed away after suffering 15 simultaneous strokes. Cause, unknown”?
Has anyone died to the wings of death?
RIP Conan
This may be the greatest episode of Hot Ones ever.
Conan really is a showman
This was literally gold
This is by far the best episode
Conan O'Brien has Dennis Hopper Energy and I will not elaborate.  (Wrote this comment less than 10 minutes in... Wasn't expecting the interview to play out like it did :V))
Incredible
Conan is KING.
F*ck yeah Conan
I don't want to watch this because it'll be over and I'll want more😁🧡🥰
Tops G. Ramsey anyday😂
This is so much chaos, I can't. T.T
Insurmountable appearance
Absolutely hilarious way to end the season 😂😂😂Conan is a BEAST
15:01 😂
I laughed 100% of the show and even watched until the end. I will also be ordering that hot sauce at the end. Thank you for this glorious moment in time.
CONAN!!!
This was the funniest thing I have watched in ages. Conan the consummate professional.
The best episode ever, Conan is the greatest living being in America
Crazy
Really really funny. Really fake hot sauce but really funny.
He’s in the first episode of Murderville (absolutely hilarious show that they need to bring back!!) and Will Arnett’s character poured a ton of hot sauce on his burger. Watching him try to talk while on fire was sooooooo effing funny.
First time I see Sean completely out of control on the format and giving it up 😂. Conan, always going 300%.
"puls.... its there" hehe
Conan simultaneously broke and owned Hot Ones
Love you Conan!!!
Hilarious!! I love conan so much, been a fan for years and years. That was the best.
I was getting some MAJOR Chris Farley vibes in the last half. Especially 20:52 on 🤣
THATS WHO I YAM!! THATS WHO I YAAAAM!
That’s the best one yet. He bested those wings.
You are not a doctor are you? "I should be." hahaha
I hope this goes down as one of the most viewed Hot Ones. This was peak comedy 😭
This interview has me convinced that Conan's been running on hot sauce his whole life and that's why he is the way he is.
One of the greatest bit of YouTube i have ever watched
Welp, good luck topping that. Its all downhill from here. 🍗 🔥
This is the best thing I have ever seen
Welp, Conan officially challenged every single late night host from here on out!
Conan is the best. Period.
7:42 I was unprepared for Dr. Arroyo to come up and take his pulse like that 😆
First we Peak!
😂 Conan got his Chris Farley on!
Conan is over the top in the best possible way.
I don't think ANY guest rubbed hot sauce on their nips, that's new...
Yes I’ve been wanted this since the first time I watched hot ones years ago.
I love how Conan is just doing a bunch of side quests now
The hard part is when it comes out the other end.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is by far the best episode in my opinion
I'm fine! And he turns brighter red than his hair.
This has been the best episode so far
i love you conan
He's a Beast!! 😂😂😂 😂
Hot Ones gave Conan a complection!
My favorite so far.
21:04 😂😂😂😂😂😂 IM DEAD ☠️
Not bad, Conan. Not bad.
Unpopular opinion incoming ... I got 5 minutes in and had to stop watching. Conan is is just unwatchable for me. I know people find him funny, but I just don't see it. My least favorite five minutes of Hot One's ever. And let it begin.
Conan is going strong as he's suffering through the pain, he's a maniac with hot wings 😂
Best episode !
Best episode ever
Amazing
I feel like Sean kinda had an idea about what to expect with this…and then suddenly his expectations got put in a full arm choke hold and shot in the head.
YEEEES CONANNNN
Is this the best episode yet?!! Love them!
Conan is THE BEST
How did he live through that?😮
This is definitely one of those "he understood the assignment" scenarios
Dude I was having an anxiety attack just watching the back half of this.  This is possibly the best episode ever.  Conan is as crazy as Steve-O!
Dude is the living embodiment of a good showman.
This is an all-time Conan performance. What an absolute maniac that we don’t deserve but absolutely need 😂
Sadly Mr O'Brien excused himself to the bathroom, exploded liquid hot diarrhea, and then spontaneously combusted and died.  RIP Conan.
At 18:32 Conan could play Trump with the make up and the sweating
What’s wrong with this dude!! 😂😂😂😂
He still not funny at all no one beat will Farrell
Between Conan giving him a huge compliment and Conan just being his crazy self, the next time Sean is asked about his favorite episodes I can almost guarantee this one will top the list.
Conan IS the greatest Hot One's guest ever. I'm saying it. There is a new bar set.
Conan will always be evergreen
BEST EPISODE EVERRRR! 🤣🤣🤣
Top 3 episodes ever. Conan is a living legend
Best season finally EVER!!!
Conan is the 🐐
HE COVERED HIMSELF IN SAUCE LIKE HE WAS A DAME WING…!! Unmatched!!
Meanwhile DJ Khalid quit
That was the best episode ever! Good job to everyone, especially Conan O'Brien. You are the best!
Is.Conan.still.ALIVE???what a season ended this was😂😂😂😂
Best episode ever!
YAYAYAYAYAYAYA! I love Conan
😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🥰 i love Conan because he know that he is insan(e)y good and embraces it . thank you
an absolute LEGEND!
I love Conan.
Peak Ones.
Is it just me or is Conando kinda starting to look like Bryan Cranston?
Funniest thing I've seen in a long time
best episode ever, conan is wild
This was an absolute MASTERPIECE of an interview!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lol >< This was so Conan haha. The constant humor, witty weird answers, and the dumb doctor bit :D Oh god, but it did go a bit too far near the end o.O Kind of disgusting
Can we get Scott Aukerman on now?
EASY the best episode of Hot Ones. EEEEEEEEEEEEEEASY!
this is one of the best episodes yet 😭😭
This is the greatest treat
This has to be the best one yet! Conan is a legend and raised the bar to Mount Everest heights!
That was kinda gross.
We love you Conan! Thank you Hot Ones for finally getting him on!
Best one EVER lol 😆
What a brave man, Conan is a real barbarian
Now do Matt patt
Pure MADNESS! I love this man! This did feel like an unhinged wrestling promo in the best way! And I agree, this is the peak!  This is the moment that will be nearly impossible to top.
He’s an affordable doctor 😅😅😅
Who knew Conan was gonna be more chaotic than Steve-O?!
I never thought I would get Jack Black vibes from Conan O'Brien.
he drank hot wax from a candle before this
This was literally in the top 5 best hot ones episodes, it up there with (pre-going off the deep end) Russell Brand, and the Chili cross overs
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the reason why Conan is the greatest of all time 😂
Imagine being told by Conan that you're a very good interviewer. Highlight of my life if I'm sitting in Sean's seat.
This was HILARIOUS!!! Best episode!!! 😂😂😂
Incredible
Craziest Episode I've seen. O'Brien is CRAZYY!!
Can’t imagine what someone who doesn’t know Conan at all would say about this
gdamn this man misses the spotlight
GOAT
Holy! *slow claps*
Conan continuously asking if its ok to put the wings in his pocket reminds me of when Norm McDonald would be on Conan and would constantly ask Conan "You got a minute?" before starting a story :'D
such a legend! I grew up with such a distaste for american talk shows but watching old conan clips and archived episodes over the past few years has been such a joy. what a great episode
Holy smoking gun! Conan is a beast!
When are y'all going to have Penn & Teller on?
this man is a legned
How can you not love Conan? 🍗 🧡
This genuinely made me laugh when he went off the deep end with Da Bomb
Conan absolutely destroyed this interview what a living legend! He commits to everything he does 110%
I can't imagine how Hot Ones tops this episode. Been a Conan fan for over 20 years and my god he makes me proud to say that.
If "I'm fine. I'm perfectly f-ing fine," doesn't become a meme, I'll riot.
Well Conan just hit #1 spot
Conan O Brian is my favorite white person !!! He ate those wings better than any other guest ever.
He is a total badass! And with comedy on point all the time! What a genious!
I physically can't watch them eat the really hot ones. It's too much to watch.
Conan is Hilarious
best hot ones epidsode ever
That was great.
The best episode of all time!
This episode is amazing Conan is awesome
Brilliant!
Best Episode Ever. Conan is King of Content.
Torille!!!
I have never laughed at this show as I did with this one. I'm talking out loud, belly laughing! I loved it!
Hands down, best episode you've ever made! A masterpiece!
Conan and Dr. Royal have a Hunter S. Thompson and Attorney Acosta vibe…
As someone whose drank 1.3 million Scoville sauce for a family challenge.... what he's done is incredible!!!!
Holy fk he crazy xD
Everyone BOW DOWN to King CONANNNNNNNNNN!!! This is just perfection!! 🙌🏽❤❤
I've left more in the first 3 minutes of this interview that I have the last 3 years of watching this interviews combined. Conan is so effortlessly funny. What a guy
My God...everything I hoped the epsiode and SOOO much more!  Amazing stuff Conan!
Nobody knows this yet but Conan died of a heart attack after recording this.
One thing I know about spicy food , you never let get in your lips!. Conan you're a beast!
This is the guest we've been waiting for! Thank you! Way better than rice spice.
This man is a master. He's hilarious af and fascinating af. Best Episode ever 😂❤
Its too bad it was sponsored by the fascist women hating racist dictatorship of texas
This is the greatest thing I've seen in a long time, maybe ever!!!
I think Conan may have just broken the show.🤔
FInally a good guest!
I've watched many episodes of this show through the last few years, and never posted a comment. But, for this episode, I am compelled to leave a comment. Conan O'Brian is a beast, if there was a "Championship Belt" for the best guest conquering The Hot Ones challenge, he won by a landslide. You just can't defeat the Irish fighting spirit, I would know, I'm half Irish and stubborn as f*ck myself.
If it's for comedy, Conan becomes a superhuman. GOAT
Conan is the best ever on this show.
My new favorite episode!
This is why Irish people are not allowed spice! 🤣
might as well wrap up Hot Ones because it can not be topped anymore.
awesome!
Conan Is The Fukin Man!
Legendary Conan O'Brien.
STANDING OVATION behind our screens, 27 minutes and 20 seconds of my life well spend!!
Was that a variation of the Jurassic Park theme? :D WE BUILT A T REX
Best episode ever
Nasty at the end but hilarious show 😂
BEST….GUEST…..EVER!! (I am looking right at you Gordon Ramsay)
That is something you don't see everyday! :D
Conan is the greatest showman of our time
I've never laughed so hard at a Hot One's episode.  This is one for the books!  What a LEGEND Conan is!
Freak’n finally! This is the guest I’ve wanted on this show for years! Conan is a comedy god! Dude MOCKED your spiciness!! XD
6:25 😂😂😂
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen! Conan is the absolute man and lest we forget about Mila Kunis saying she was gonna help make this happen! Shout out to Sean and the HotOnes crew for this and years of entertainment!
That was worth waiting for years!!! Absolutely what I hoped for! Love you Conan
I need Conan in my life. He’s been there since I was 11/12 and now I’m 39.
CONAN!!!!!!! ❤
This may be the greatest episode ever 😂😂😂😂😂
Lol, the bomb made Conan into the Joker lol
I used to hate Conan when I was younger, but once I actually watched his show my eyes were opened to some great humor. He’s hilarious, over the top, and completely unpredictable 😂 I could not stop laughing the entire time. Amazing end to the season!
THE GOAT. THAT IS WHY HE IS A LEGEND!!!
How is this more chaotic then Eric Andre
Did Conan just win Hot Ones?
Best episode ever!
I cried😂
FINALLY!!!! AHHH!!!!
This is the most unhinged episode yet hahah, no one will top Conan.
Most chaotic episode ever!!!!! How is he still alive…..
Best episode ever!
This has to be the best one 🤣🤣🤣
I dare say this tops Gordon Ramsey
Conan is the greatest of all time
Jesus I'm dying 😂
Conan does not disappoint. Absolute boss.
Oh my God. The shot of the hot sauce spilling over the table as Conan is going on a rant at the end is GOLD.
I swear just a few minutes in and Conan saying "can i keep these?" and slides a half eaten wing in his pocket made me dieee. I can only imagine his reaction to finding that wing later in the day lol
this is my superbowl
This was magic. Thank you.
Conan turned into Lewis Black at the end there! LOL!
Now we just need Jordan Schlansky as a guest so we can see him taste and critique various hot sauces.
Conan is the greatest comedian, late night host of all time... He is a classic, he will be studied on how to start in comedy/hosting/interviewing ect. Conan is a solid foundation to begin with....
new favorite guest
1st episode i watched from start till end. Bravo always enjoyed Conans specific sense of humor.
So much nostalgia here. I'm actually weeping. He's brought me so much joy. Cannot wait for this new show.
The best. Can't be topped. And dishing the compliments too. That's a pro!
This was great!!! 😂
The man commits to a bit. Respect
Name ONE episode better than that one.. ONE!..
Oh my...I believe Conan actually got high from the sauces.  The after show outtakes have got to be a gem.
No one compares to the magnitude and magnificent of Conan.
How did he do that 😂 that's insane he went full blown Irish in the end , crazy and poetic at the same time 😂😂😂😂
BEST EPISODE!!! Conan the GOAT
Pure insanity 😂😂😂😂
Finally! Peak of this show!
I think this is disgusting just showing Conan's death like this.
The only person on Hot Ones to not break character. Conan is awesome!
😂😂😂😂😂This episode needs a follow-up, showing Conan's condition d following day,,,
I feel like in an alternate reality Conan really is The Joker
Had a rough day But you made my day
YOU FINALLY GOT CONAN!!!  I just watched the one episode that you wish he was on. Congratulations 🎉🎊 you made it to one of your goals! Keep up the good work. Great episode and closure
It has to be said, every talk show host, of any esteem, has people coming out against them. Talking of how the person isn’t as nice or friendly as they seem. Conan, however, only has people coming forward to say he’s exactly what he seems to be. He’s goofy, he’s annoying, he’s childish, but in the absolute best way possible. The man, the legend, the G.O.A.T, the one and only… Conan!!!
By some distance your best episode ever
Who did Conan O Brien's makeup bc I wanna know what highlighter and bronzer he used
The perfect companion to the Cate Blanchett episode. Honestly, I need a muscle relaxant cocktail after this.
Conan is the late night 🐐
this is the best episode
Oh Conan…your poor toilet. I found myself yelling “No, Conan!” Multiple times watching this one. Look for Conan tonight at Cedar Sinai hospital.
Stone cold classic episode that one, absolutely brilliant
I legitimately haven't laughed that hard in so long. This was my favorite Hot Ones ever.
A bit too much but he went for it, respect 😂 Also, I think that we can safely say that spicy makes you high
Never clicked an episode so fast
I’ve been waiting for this so long. Thank you! Conan is the goat.
I’m a simple man. I see Conan, I click.
This is great. Now we need Matt Gourley on.
The "wing pocketing" bit made this episode a little more spicier 😊
I never believed the i would see the day someone outspices Sean Evans 😂
Holy $k!t I'm just now seeing Conan as Beaker from the Muppets.... wow how have I never seen this b4
Amazing nbc went from Conan to Fallon who’s a complete dud
The Golden God.
❤❤❤CONAN❤❤❤
Conan would be the perfect choice for an hour long talk show like Graham Norton!  Would shake things up on American TV...
Excellent way to finish a season!
one of the best interviewers interviews one of the best interviewers
Conan is someone all late night talk show hosts should strive to be like.
Who doesn't love Conan? He's the best. Thank you for this episode. 🙏
Legendary episode!
conan wins!
By far! My favorite guest! He jumped to the top! He’s HILARIOUS!!
This is exactly as unhinged as I expected and hoped for
Conan is an absolute animal as always. Bravo good sirs bravo.
DR ARROYO 😂😂😂😂 Conan is goated
And thats why He's a legend
Awesome season finale.   Issue: How the heck do you even try to do another season knowing nothing can ever top the greatness of this episode?
Best ever episode 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Watching this, screaming " Conan! No!!!" 😂😂😂 Freaking legend. 🔥🔥🔥
This is how mania looks like folks.
This is THE BEST Hot Ones so far! Conan is funny yet authentic. It's a joke yet it's pure shenanigans. You can't predict the future 😅
Coco is king
Honestly one of the funniest things I’ve EVER seen. Incredible 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The best one in years ! He killed this! Loved every moment
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen.  Ever.
This is amazing 😅😂
Hot ones has peaked. It's all down hill from here boys. No topping this
Conan is literal crazy person
7:13 - 7:25 That kind of compliment from Conan means a lot.
Greatest Episode ever!
I knew this was going to be amazing. But it was more than that: it was disgusting.
LEGENDARY
Peak hot ones.
😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
I did not expect Dr. Arroyo. This episode only felt like 9 minutes 😂
CONAN.  How did Shawn get the king of late night.
Best guest ever
Conan O'Brien is my spirit animal.
What an incredible entertainer.
i fell upon this, not regretting one minute of this Hot Ones gem😂😂
WHAT A LEGEND
Almost as good as the Ice Spice interview
I am so glad you didn't give any of his crazy antics away in the beginning... it was a crescendo of pure Epic Amazingness! Best Episode Eva.. 😂😅😂😅😂😅
Thank you Conan for calling out the ridiculous decision of dropping "HBO" arguably one of the most iconic and well known channels in all of television history for "Max"... I swear these companies are TRYING to destroy America.
Conan - ‘I’m fine’  Narrator - Conan was not, in fact, fine
LEGENDARY
2:13 wow , this was very real life Robert Patrick here . The guy who played the T1000 in Terminator 2   Come to think of it he should do hot ones . dude is hilarious .
Conan is the GOAT
It seems that Sean is feeling the pressure to laugh and giggle even when Conan isn't joking
Absolutely legendary episode. Funniest so far in my opinion.
Quite possibly the best episode ever! You gotta love how Conan goes all out for the laughs, and he’s also the only late night host to have multiple metal bands on and let them play their heaviest songs (The Heretic Anthem from Slipknot is still the heaviest thing ever allowed on national television). 🤘
blegh disgusting to look at but good for him
Besides the Gordon Ramsay episode....THIS IS THE ONE! Ill rewatch just to keep laughing. Conan O'Brien is amazing and such a champ!!!
Oh my god. He’s a champ. This is the best episode of Hot Ones.
the best talk show host of all time conan motherfking O'brien.
Genius!
One of the best episodes!
Best episode ever
A generation was absolutely robbed of Conan's comedic genius on tv. Late night tv is on too late anyway. Woman after Colbert is good tho
Ain't no one can disrespect Da'bomb like Conan did. Killed it and how, No guest is topping that
23:00 🤌
YASSSSS! 🎉🎉🎉 Conan broke the mold. Sean's usual mirroring mold had no chance. He lost control of the interview midway and i dont judge him the least bit.
my goodness what a legend
Best best best best episode ever . 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
That was awsome
Conan may be the greatest Hot One's guest ever.
That is a comic genius so dedicated to his craft he's willing to fry his own colon. Bravo good sir.
😂😂😂 unhinged
the greatest episode of all time
Conan is just the best 🫡♥️ He just won Hot Ones 😂😂😅
Best episode 😂
“There he goes. One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die.”
Conan, Shia and Paul or my favorite episodes. Thats honestly off the top of my head. I know there have been many guests finish and destroy it but those 3 are my ish lol
Didnt Sean say to Shakira she closes the Season??
No one is beating Conan after this.
I wish I could upvote twice!
Man!! 😄 Conan went all in!!!
Awesome guest
perhaps the most (no - it is) by far the most impressive episode ever!
The end was ABSOLUTELY UNHINGED and perfectly Conan O'Brien
This is the best episode to date. Conan was absolutely hilarious and just how you would want a comedian to go off the rails.
He's getting on the  water buffalo.
I knew he was going to feel it when tried Da bomb.....that's sauce never fails
Conan absolutely just earned us all watching his show on Max
That's just gold .
This is the greatest season finale ever, Conan is still the man, I can't wait for April 18th, on HBO Max, or Max, whatever you wanna call it!!!!
Everybody knows the sauce lineup has gotten weaker since the a list celebs showed up.
I want to see everything that was left on the cutting room floor. Everything.
I mean, he would say Mad Magazine is funny
This is it
No matter how hot things got, he never lost himself when answering questions. He was really professional!!!!
AMAZING!!! HOLLY MOLLY!! This amount of spice won't ever be top ever! Conna you are the man!
Since when has hot ones been a buzzfeed thing????
That was absolutely insane.  I love it.  Conan is on another plane of existence.
Jesus Christ, i do not comment often but God bless Conan, og
Wow my guy... wow.
Conan is the best. Drinking hot sauce like it's milk.
Epic
Equal parts chaos and insight. Conan is truly one of the greats.
YES!!!!
COOOOOONAAANNN OOOOOOOOOOOBBBBBBBBRRRRIIIIIIIIIEEEENNNNN
Amazing! Best guest ever! Conan is the absolute best!
Absolutely incredible.  Hardest I've laughed and consistent laughter.  Amazing.
Way to end a season love you Sean and Conan !
hes gonna destroy his toilet when he gets home
This is why I pay for Internet
I felt the pain from this one... Conan has not lost his craziest one bit, if anything with age he's gotten crazier
I have been so naive believing people from Central America, Nigeria and India would have the greatest tolerance, but no, I was so wrong. There is a reason why The Irish only eat bland food…Spices are completely wasted on them since they don’t feel a thing.
This was amazing and we REQUIRE all of the BTS footage that you have.
I love Conan. Thank you for having him on the show.
The best comedian to me. My goat 🐐 at least for me🙌
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
O'Brien is a legend man just last dab the bomb beyond insanity!!!!!!! Might be the king of Hot Ones!
The timing makes it even more hilarious 13:44
CONAN IS THE GOAT!!
COOOOOOONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN! yes.
if there’s ever a live action of Rick and Morty this is the guy
GOAT. Conan is the just the best.
What a great finale
This is perfection
OH MY GOD!!!  Conan you are a legend!!  A burnt legend but a legend all the same. I laughed too much, up until you turned my stomach at the end hahahahaha. Somebody finally took Gordon Ramsey to the mattresses ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Wow... Conesy REALLY out-conesy'd himself here. Absolutely crying. 😂
That’s by far the best episode ever! No lie!
Insane
Epic interview! Conan raises the bar so high for future comedians I’m worried Sean may struggle now to get them to come on the show.
These two together is amazing, now to let Conan rot my brain on Max...I'll need a projector to get it on him but he says it's cool.
OK, this may be my favorite Hot Ones. 👍🏻
Incredible
Yeeeeeesssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Crazy, disturbing and funny. Also disgusting. Whoah.
Bravo! What an episode. I laughed, cried and was in total shock. Conan FTW.
Probably the best episode I have seen! I could not stop laughing! 🤣
I was watching something else. I saw Conan and I immediately came here! 0 seconds elapsed!   I love Conan!!!
Greatest episode of Hot Ones ever
By FAR You're best guest.
I'm crying from laughter and empathetic spice pain.
Fantastic episode! Love that Coney!
YES! I was just reminiscing with Conan & Jordan Peterson episodes and wishing he was still doing the talk show. But now he's here! And.... I'm learning he has other things going on lol   Also Sean was not ready for this XD
la grand finale😱EPIC
This is the greatest episode of Hot Ones next to Gordon Ramsays Hot Ones episode. He drenched his wings with Hot Sauce and even drank some of the bottles. Hes a madman
I have a new level of respect by Conan O'Brien...
Alright.... hands down this was my favorite episode. Conan is a beast. WOW! He knocked it out of the park. He pretty much last dabbed every single wing and then some  😂😂😂
I've never laughed so hard at one of these, the back of my head hurts from smiling
The wings were actually melting his mind. Very rare
THIS MAN IS THE GOAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That episode was pure comedy great show Sean and conan
I’ve never been so entertained!!! 1000/10 episode 👏🏻👏🏻
Conan for sure went straight to the ER lol
absolute LEGEND
The true mad lad..!
While I don't agree with Conans' politics, I have to admit he is funny AF. I haven't laughed this hard in forever. GREAT SHOW!!!!
this one breaks the top 5 all time episodes!!!!
Is Conan even human?
Best episode I’ve ever
Finally
Shoulda listened to Andy, water Buffalo highjinx...
Finally they had an interesting guest this season too bad it's the last one
I don't see how there's any possible way to top this. Conan only ever gets better.
BEST INTERVIEW EVER
Wow, Conan really went out and said "whatever DJ Khalid did on here, I'm going to do the exact opposite".
20:57 make this a meme
Best episode ever! Love Conan!
Awesome 😅
This is the best one by far! 😂😢😢 why can’t  I feel.. facts the wing drop golden
I think there was a point in filming this episode where even Conan knew he may have gone a little too crazy and he just leaned in harder to it for the bit.
Undoubtedly the single most impressive piece of performance art so far this century.
I WAS HERE.
Feels like we’ll be reading Conan and Sean’s obituaries for their comedy after the closing. Fantastic!
“I’m not gonna lie….. 😅”
Awesome, simply awesome lol
I love Conan, comedy gold...the slobber and messy eating at the end is just too hard for me to watch lol.
How much coke did he have before this show?
The Dr. bit has me crying 🤣
Simply the best
Up there with Dave Grohl
I can feel his assistant's blood pressure rise with each wing that goes into that pocket, knowing they're gonna clean that thing out.
I just found out Conan and i share the same birthday. And to be praised on interview skill from one of the best to do it is insane
... and here we find ourselves at the peak of guests. What a view!
Your a mad man Conan lol
I feel entertained😂
How is he alive? His insides must be burning 🥵
This is the best Hot Ones episode of all time. Well done FWF! Truly a culture breaker.
I'm in 😭 😂😂😂😂. Best episode ever!!!
Conan OBrien is one of the funniest people in the past 50 years (in my opinion)
I knew it
My favourite episode so far this season
fricken love conan! this is such an awesome episode
Literally, though?😂
It's always Da Bomb that gets people.
Conan the GOAT of comedy
The hot sauce on his fingers alone gave me anxiety
I been wanting Conan on here since the first season.
Corny af. Yawn
Conan is so funny!!! Awesome show.
Fantastic episode! Thank you Sean and Conan! This will be hard to beat.
That was batshit f&cking crazy
Don’t even like this guy. But that was impressive .. lol
This looks exactly like Conan :v :v
Never seen Sean seem incapable of handling a guest til now.  Also Conan was totally transferring his pain into pure outbursts of randomness by the end. lol
can anyone correctly give the names of books Conan was talking about
You got four more years tops is such a cold blooded thing to say to an elderly woman lol. Love conan
Wildest episode ever.
Great closer.
Calm quiet start and overall chill vibe, so I assumed it was gonna be a low-key interview. Then 21:05 happened 😂
Sean is so shook after about minute 22 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
By far the best hot ones ever
More energy and danger then Steve O!!!!!!!
first time i clapped in my office
25:29 I love how Conan is in such a delerious state that when everyone starts clapping he looks around like he's getting rushed by a mob
Best hot ones ever!
Favorite or not. This is going down in the Hot Ones history books!
This is probably the best episode of Hot Ones so far. Lots of love to Conan!
Conan is one of the funniest mf.
JON STEWART NEXT
😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is why i love Conan
I honestly think this is the best episode they've ever had. Literally crying, Conan proves why he should be in the conversation for the greatest to ever do it.
Best guest ever
POV: you challenged the toughest guy at the irish pub to a drinking game and the stakes are HIGHHHH but instead of drinks its wings
Wow, that was crazy. Possibly the best episode ever 😂
I wish it wouldn't end😂😂
I love this man
BEST EPISODE EVER!!
I'm glad he's more often on my feed these days! Conan you're awesome 🎉
Probably one of the funniest episodes I've ever seen! I love Conan! Great season guys and gals!
22:22 What a BEAST! 😂
worth the wait
Best episode ever!!! Been watching from the beginning and this takes the cake.
pure Capsaicin is 16 million scoville and the hottest sauce they have is 2.7 million
Now do Jay Leno..oh...wait. Somebody call a priest for Conans last rites!
Conan did NOT have a good night after that.
Conan doin his best Eric Endre impression
What a legend! Best episode ever!
Conan O'Brien needs a doctor *brings his own writer disguised as his doctor*
Ive been watching since season 1 and this is by far top 3. Conan is a beast!
this is the most entertaining interview ever - behind DJ Khaled.
It’s rare in this day and age to encounter something highly anticipated that lives up to every single expectation, but this episode absolutely does.  Bravo to all involved. Bravo!
That ending almost made me puke 🤢
This has been, without a doubt, the most enjoyable and hilarious interview on this show!
Everything from 22:00 onwards. 😂Sean worrying if he'd genuinely killed his guest. Conan uncontrollably drooling while yelling "I'M FINE" with red eyes...
I’ve been on a big Conan trip so this is literally perfect
That was delightfully chaotic
"I've got a little eye-watering going on Conan" *"That's because you're meeting your idol."*
🐃
Conan: I'm Irish (proceeds to crush every wing like a champ)
This is the best one yet
💀💀💀🤣
Conan killed it!
This is my favorite episode of all time. There is no topping this episode!
@23:50 the way the camera man zooms in on the scene of chaos and destructon as Conan is in the middle of a passionate speech about reading
will always be my only liked talk show host
😂😂😂 I am laughing so hard... Conan did the unthinkable, amazing
I have watched all the Hot Ones episodes and I can 100% percent say, this is the best one and I don't think it will be beaten. I have never laughed so much! Thank you Sean and Conan!
Who remembers that Dr. Arroyo is the dermatologist from the beach remote in Australia
I love Conan
Wow! Sean was not ready for the noise!
Dr. Arroyo...
😂 easily one of the best episodes!
He's such a ham.  Love it.
Amazing
Watching him drink the sauces actually made me nauseous 😭
"I went out of state..." that's Dr... everyone doesn't need
Jose!
Well that episode goes straight onto the LEGENDS shelf……..WOW….!!!  Conan nailed those wings and kept the ‘funny’ going hard!!
Best season finale by far
Single best episode ever.
I think Conan might have coated his mouth in throat with wax.
Thank god he uses his powers for comedy and not evil, because he would have been one of the most terrifying men ever. 😂
This is probably the best episode of Hot Ones ever.
I immediately thought it was an April Fools prank before I realized that was last week 🤯
Sorry David Blaine, Conan wins😅 And what I can say about the last dab... Hmm, Conan has had 5 last dabs in succession🤣
THIS IS WHY IT TOOK 20 SEASONS!!! We really aren’t worthy of this level of guest. Love you sincerely Conan 💜
This was the best episode yet 😂😂😂 amazing 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Man I can't wait to hear him talk about this on his podcast.
This was possibly the best one of them all! Conan is all out nuts and I love it!
BRAVO
Conan for president
As someone who has never been a fan of talk shows, I had no idea Conan was this funny
I am not disappointed....😅😅
Hilarious
Conan is a Hot Ones Champ
What an incredible compliment from Conan to Sean about his interviewing skills. That was a real moment and Sean was truly touched. Loved that and Sean deserves that recognition!
What a legend! I was crying laughing towards the end!
That was a performance that may never be topped.
i loved Conan for like 5 years since i was 16-17 because he’s such a genuine nice, hardworking, good person and for my money was the only good talk show host of the last decade if not longer. love him amazing guy.
I'd not have chosen Conan for a Season Finale. He's "over the top" for no reason, his "antics" aren't funny (except to sheepy, hive minded morons that don't want to see reality and only want to be entertained.) Conan should be grateful that Carson, Letterman, and Leno all took his Harvard "Lampoon" idiotic,self-destructive,  outlandish, and mostly unfunny self and "took him under their wings". What a waste of MY time.
🤣🤣🤣
Conan is a G😎🔥💯 and was too funny on the this episode
Simply epic.
is dr. arroyo from that small commune founded by the vault dweller?
Legit concerned about my beloved Conan. His eyes are bleeding  Hope someone's checking on him lol
"WHATS THE POINT OF EVEN BEING ALIVE, IF WE CANT DO THIS!!!" I f*cking love him. 🤣🤣😆😩🤣
Best Hot Ones episodes ever.
legendary episode, nobody can beat conan
My favorite moment (and it's almost impossible to choose) was when Conan genuinely complimented Sean from the heart. I was never so proud as I was at that both for Sean and Conan. This was hands down, A LEGENDARY SHOW. I will tell every one I know to catch this show and I'm sure it will have the same effect as my first show with Gordon Ramsey. This series has put youtube on the map.
Conan is peak comedy.  From Late night host to comedy legend.  We can go ahead and pack it up on Hot Ones....we are have reached the peak.
AT 19:19 the vain blogging under his eye is insane!!!!
Conan just set the bar at an impossible level.
forever legendary
He can’t feel 😂 22:27
This might have been the best & craziest Hot Ones yet 😂
😂😂😂😂😂
I YAM WHAT I YAM.
I always imagined Coco would crumble hard. I have been proven wrong and I'm so happy to be proven wrong. This was fun
This is legendary
CALL THE WIFE!
Nothing could have prepared me for the second half of the video but yet again it is Conan 😂
Conan is a perfect host, and a perfect guest. He's switched on today lol
*That is how you do it.*
One word: WOW!
WHY IS HE PUTTING THEM IN HIS POCKET
Its okay. Hes a Harvard Graduate!
YES! Finally!
CONAN IS LEGEND!!!!!! The man is a national treasure
Team coco
Arroyo killed it.
fantastic
Pack it up.  It doesn't get better.
What an honor. The compliment he gave you was serious and sincere. Coming from him that was special. The man’s a genius up there with Carson , Carlin and Pryor. And that was like David Blaine in an amazing way.
Thank you 🙏
Did anyone else think Conan went a little Nathan Lane near the end?
dr royal is a direct student of the great dr.spaceman from 30 rock
Great season finale. When is the next season?
🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣  How can you not love Conan?
CONAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I CLICKED SO FAST
Conan's going to have such a blast in the restroom 💀             (Pun intended 🗿)
If this was the final finale and the show ended here I would understand. He stole it. Completely unhinged but somehow kept sticking the landing. Intense. Funny. I’m watching whatever show he just plugged for sure
Most badass hot ones performance.
Did you get Conan or Stevo on this season finale???... All I can think of is "We haven't heard form Coolio in a while..." pt2
Best episode
GOAT
Epic
This is height of comedy. Conan was ahead of his times.
Conan sounding like Master Shake by the end.
I'm legitimately scared
Can I have that jacket? Chicken wing pocket an all.. please
Bravo.  Bravo Mr. O’Brien.
Amazing!
Anyone ever seen “The Madness of King George”? 😂
Nobody will top this
Wow… Conan might just be the best episode of hot ones ever. That was amazing!
him and Jordan Schhlansky should do truth or dab.
jfc
This is THE Episode of all time.
The most epic episode EVER!
Just in case you don't know the video of him on the water Buffalo is on the team Coco channel
I love Conan since the 90's and is my favorite talk show host ever, but how did he ever make it to this fine age of 60? Regardless he's the goat!
Conan is the goat! That might be my favorite hot ones episode of all time. 😂😂
Wow Conan is CRAZY
THE GOAT
best episode by far
Conan was my favorite tv talk show guy I miss seeing him he had the best remotes and interactions with his guests. Conan is #1
im really starting to think Conan is the only other man than Bryan Cranston who couldve played Hal.
This takes the cake (sauce?). BEST Hot Ones interview of all time.
“Like eating whip cream on a hot August afternoon noon…”😂🤣😂
Incredible
Conan is legitimately the all time greatest
Others : Drinks milk, when it gets hot. Conan: Drinks hot sauce.
I knew this was going to be a great episode, but nothing could have really prepared me for this.
BEST ONE YET!! Conan is the best
Conan, put the bottle of da bomb down please 🙏🏾😂😂😂
Have we all witnessed the greatest Hot Ones episode in its history? How can this ever be peaked? Conan you absolute legend.
Best. epidose. EVER!!!
Salt and peper baby !! Go Conan!
hard to top ;) (eventually the rock crying after dab 3 or so ...)
Conan is the only one i have seen not very much affected by the Da Bomb
Best hot ones episode period!
Hahahaha. The best.
this is the best episode ever
Conan licking DaBomb 😮
This was everything ❤
He never mentioned on the podcast that he’d had his entire digestive tract lined with asbestos. Legend.
Conan O Brian gotta be the biggest legend ever attent the show! Monster Dabs till the end!
I can't stop laughing
This is unhinged
Fantastic!!  ❤ Coco!!
Welp, that's it, show's over now.  You had a good run but nothing can ever top this episode.  Conan had me busting up laughing like a maniac the whole time, his energy and commitment and quick wit are simply a masterclass in entertainment.  I am definitely keeping this episode open in it's own Chrome tab and rewatching it whenever I am feeling down or want a laugh.  This is pure peak platinum premium TV worthy content, I'm honestly surprised some network hasn't scooped this brand up yet.
This is it. This is the best Hot Ones ever. Just wrap it up. Call it quits. Go out on top.
This has to be the best episode ever.
Aren't red heads known for being able to take a higher level of pain tolerance? This explains his hot sauce reaction lol
Wait. Hold up. I thought Shakira was the final guest of this season??? Ooooooooo sean be lyinnnn! 😮
Best Hot Ones EVER!!  Conan is always relevant and a comedic genius
Conan needs a friend and some laxative ASAP great show my friend
It is said that red heads tolerate pain a lot more
Bravo 👏🏽 👏🏽 👏🏽  Conan the goat!
Favorite moment? Every f#%cking second of it.
Only Conan could start an interview like Hot Ones as a well put together man that says full eloquent sentences like "Thanks for having me and I'm happy to be here." and slowly devolve into a hot sauce-drinking disheveled wino, incoherently ranting about comedy in literature, by the end of the interview.
Man definately handled those wings better than any one that has ever been in this show. Conan is the goat for sure 😂
Best late night host ever
Comedy genius. <3
Its there
This one left me afraid to touch my eyes.  Conan elevated this show to pure comedy lunacy!
In Ireland, mayo and pepper are the two spiciest things.  LOL   Let's face it, when it comes to doing the wings, Conan is The GOAT.  I firmly believe that this episode will be hard to beat for a very, very long time.
I couldn’t even see the screen towards the end my eyes were filled with tears! 😂😂😂😂
What an incredible episode I’m speechless 😭
It just progressively gets more and more unhinged 😂
LIVING LEGEND!
I'm sorry to say it, but Hot Ones might just as well shut down now. NO ONE will ever be able to top what Conan just did in this video.
Conan should be in every Hot Ones season finale
Thoughts and prayers for the first guest of next season...
I'd love for Sean to go on the CONAF podcast. I feel like it could be a fantastic episode.
He’s nuts and I love it!
Best guest
🥵🥵🥵
What a legend!
There just needs to be a show where Conan is the one always being interviewed by a rotation of various guests.
Holly Molly, what a Champ!
Just pure gold!!
Such a beautifully unhinged episode. Couldn't beg for a better finale. 🥹
Watching this back-to-back with Ice Spice’s interview is WILD
My fave was him spinning on the chair….aaawwhoooooo!!
conan starting to look a lil like rick astley
Best. Episode. Ever. What a professional
This man is absolutely unhinged 😂
😂😂😂😂😂
If anyone says they haven't heard of this show send them this episode.
I laughed so hard. My tummy hurts.
“I yam who I yam. I said it, Gandhi said it, and Popeye said it.”  This might be one of my favorite Conan quotes of all time.
What totally fun ride!!!😂😂😂 A wet and reckless BOAT ride🎉 Conan is the Best Of All Time🎉
22:54 Look how scared Sean is for Conan in this moment 😅
@Hot Ones, whilst you're milking views by bringing celebrities or famous people on to your show, it would also be good if you interacted more with your audience. After all, it's because of us that you're even relevant. We pay your paychecks.
CONAN IS AN ABSOLUTE LEGEND. I adore that man and he’s always been my favorite late night host. The dude just knows comedy 100%.
I'll put this down as my favorite HotOnes show yet.
Creepy
honestly at first i thought conan was just going big for laughs...but i have MAD respect for the amount he poured on...thats some serious horsepower sauces!!!!!!
Conan is the best 🤣
Best late night show host of all time, not even a contest
isn't this filmed at like 10 in the morning
What a monster.
He went from Conan O’Brien in the beginning to John Pinette near the end.😂😂😂
bar raised…
I feel like you can see Conan's respect for Sean grow instantly when he references something as specific and old-timey as Edward R. Murrow 😂
Love Conan. Used to watch him with my Grandpa back in the day (back in the day in this case being the 2010s lol) Great guest for the show!! Instant classic
Coco is the wing king 🤴
No wayyy!!! I just recently got really into watching Conan and the first thing I did a few weeks ago was search to see if he had ever done Hot Ones! What impeccable timing!
the sauce is all over his face🤣
Easily the best guest on the show. First time I've shared it with others.
This might be the greatest episode ever.
That last rant from Conan reminded me of a Rick Sanchez rant
Conan is the riddler
What a legend
I've waited years for this...and I was not disappointed in the slightest bit...in fact...it exceeded expectations.
Cocan going to make Sean RETIRE. This is wild
Even Steve-O wasn't this crazy 😮
This man is a legend. Greatest performer in the history of history🎉
This episode and the one with Gordon Ramsey are my favorite episodes
Our generation's best talk show host.
Love Coco! Great way to end the season!
This was hilarious!
Andy next please!
Wow. I expected Conan to be sweating after the 3rd wing. That was amazing.
This was the best episode to date !!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You know it’s a bit extreme when Sean goes “WHOA!” Regarding hot sauce 😂😂
Great!
and for the win, Conan O Brian! Have yet to see someone do better.👏👏
loove himmmm!!!! looove this ♡
He is an ICON
That's the best one yet!
Horrible guest
I love how you can see the worry in Sean's eyes for a good, long while after Conan eats that final wing.
ill be honest i didnt expect that to be amazing but dam Conan went crazy absolutely killed that
We need that man for the Christmas special
That DaBomb clarity just hits different 🤣
That was epic. Conan put himself top of the Hot Ones Tree by far. Genuinely beaming from ear to ear - this was hilarious. How can anyone ever top that? A lot of guests try to play it cool, Conan just said “sod that, I’m going for it” and that he did indeed. 10 out of 10 show.
What a way to go. RIP, Conan :')
this is the most unhinged hot ones ive ever seen
Best Hot Ones ever! Conan is the GOAT.
Sorry Conan, but I have never really been a fan. Would give this a 10/10 though, best Hot Ones episodes in a while.
Conan is just a Comedy Genius. I am so grateful I get to witness this
Not all heroes wear capes!!!
man i love conan o'brien.
Anybody know where I can find Conan's jacket?
just as chaotic as I was hoping 😂
Conan is more gangsta than coolio
BEST HOT ONES EVER! Conan is truly the GOAT
Now it’s time to get Leno on here, compare the performances, and determine once and for all if he deserved the Tonight Show over Conan.
"Where did you go to medical school?"  "Uhhh Outa State.."   You should go
He is going to have the biggest rash on on his face !!!
Conan is always a delight  to watch
Thats how we know and love Conan. A smile on his lips and his pockets full of wings. Beautiful.
I don't know what to think. This was amazing but part of me still wants to say "Conan, we already love you, you don't have to do this"
Best episode ever!
I'm not sure I've seen Sean give such a look of concern as at 22:37... This has to be one of the best episodes.
This is probably the best interview of the whole season 😂😂😂
Conan obrian is hands down one of the funniest human beings in this world
And his hair stayed in tact.  Not even surprised
I'm not cheering for his immolation, I'm cheering because of Conan's new show.
Who in their right mind asked for this dude on this show. This is the most bizarre and incoherent episode since FWF began. Peace Out.
Why is Conan tucking his chicken wings😂
Best hot ones ever❤
This is exactly what I hope for in a Hot Ones episode with Conan O'Brien
Greatest episode ever!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂
...he drank...from the bottle.
This is the best Hot Ones ever.
Pure Chaos just how it should be
This was rhe craziest episode so far!!!!
Sean is not on the same level (skips extra dabs until wing #9), he's just watching the train wreak (Conan's bit).  Edit: I think Conan is as high as I have ever seen someone, eating peppers.
No way!!!
That ending was very Gene Wilder Wonka
Hands down the best Hot Ones episode I've ever seen. Conan is the best.
The most unhinged episode yet
best episode ever
This episode beats my favorite one with Eric Andre 😂😂😂 Conan was worth the wait ❤
This was insane
This is up there with the shia lebouf episode! 🔥
Genuinely laughed with tears in my eyes for this one 😂 Bravo!!
Yaaaaayyy!!! Conan is on fire!
Conan just took the number one spot imo.
Just end the show here, nothing can match this! ever! CONAN is such a legend.
I don’t remember the last time Sean was red in the face during a show 😂😂😂
Friggin hilarious man
Holy cow! Commitment to the bit is insane.  I would like to see Sona and Gourley do this show.
Great comedy to read: transcript for First we feast season finale 4/11/2024
After that Murderville episode, Conan lost all of his ability to feel the effects of hot sauce.
This was far and away my favorite
Best late night talk show host, the others are irrelevant
EPIC
RAHHHHHHHHHH LETS GOO
This is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in my life! I am literally crying in my chair here!  I've always admired Conan's 100% commitment to his bits (sorry, to life), but I never before realized just how extreme he was willing to go... my god.
Wow Conan amazing! I feel like you’re  channeling Tony Clifton here
Hallelujah
Conan is easily one of if not the best guest they’ve ever had. What a landmark moment for Sean.
Wow, what a great episode, he's such a good actor that he was able to shut off all human norms when dousing the wing with the hottest sauce and drinking some as well, that was WILD
This was completely unhinged and I LOVED IT
Conan is the Golden God!!!! Hands down, the most hilarious interview Hot Ones has ever done!
Fantastic
Oh my god- bringing the doctor on immediately set the tone and made me love Conan one hundred million times more
Best episode ever
Conan is a mad man! I absolutely love him!
Gotta love Conan O Brien 😆
Nothing could have prepared me for this episode. The best talk show host turns out to also be the best hot ones guest.
Don't end such a great season ending with an ad!!
Conan is the 🐐
Greatest thing ever
Proud to say I've been on me of the Conan fans begging for YEARS to have Coco on. If you don't already listen or watch, get into his podcast. He keeps me laughing year round, every Monday.
"I said that to Bea Arthur and I was right"  💀💀💀
Easily the best episode ever
I was not prepared for 21:00
My question is, was there a hospital visit later? Also, is he still alive or did he spontaneously combust?
The best season finale ever!!!!!!
I don't think we'll ever get a Hot Ones finale that tops this one's insanitation or _insanity_ 🤣
This is the most unhinged thing I've seen this year.
It’s truly a landmark moment, when you are left completely speechless after watching literally years of this show.
I should not have been watching this at work. This was magical!
Took long enough!:)
He gave it his all, phenomenal performance Mr. O'Brien. I was entertained!
“Call the wife!” 🤣
That was pure insanity, greatest episode of hot ones ever!
Best thing I've ever watched
Epic 😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉
Thank you guys, for this Interview. Love everything about it.
It was a "bit".  No way were the hot sauces real.
This was awesome 😂
i've been watching for years and this one was INCREDIBLE
This was unhinged...in the absolute best way
Bro, Conan's b-hole the next day...
I laughed even harder at this episode than the one with Bobby Lee.
It's amazing that the only person who has matched Coolio in going insane on the wing challenge is Conan O'Brien. That's wild to me but also awesome.
The best episode, hands down!
“What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I feel?!” 😂😂
Legendary!!
I knew this was going off the rails as soon as I saw Conan
WHAT IS HAPPENING?!?!
Conan just woke me from my daze with that incredible performance 😂! My god that was legendary  👏 !
best hot ones ever!
Get matpat on the show, he’s developed a way to get through the gauntlet and it would be interesting to see it put through the test. Plus since he just retired it’d be a perfect time to interview him.
This was not what i was expecting. But this was really a wild interview.
chaotic, and conan was trying to hard to be funny to actually be funny.  i respect the man, but let some natural comedy shine
Wow, I never thought Conan would destroy the wings like that, knowing the way he acted all these years on TV about spicy food. Crazy impressive ! Or he doesn't have any feelings anymore 😅
In my opinion, best show since Will Ferrell
I was in absolute tears during the whole episode 😂 I love Conan
this is AWESOME!!
Top 3 hands down!
Did Conan O-Brien just win Hot Ones?!?!?!?
Best Hot Ones of all time.
Best episode of all time 😂
Ah Yes!👍 At last, look who it is... it's  Jedediah Longtree himself, finally!👍😎🍻
Not even 2 mins in and Conan has his own recurring bit with an actor he brought with him. Comedy legend.
Nobody.. i repeat nobody will repeat or top what Conan has done on this episode.
Somewhere a redheaded guy sits on a toilet, weeping and groaning
BEST EPISODE :)
Best episode so far
incredible
oh this is gonna be a popular one
LOL never seen anything like that.  Conan destroyed!!
Thank you Conan
This is one of the funniest things I have ever seen!
This is one of the best episodes ever. Conan — what an international treasure.
The other guy lol
Never thought I'd say, "I've never clicked on a video so fast," but here we are.
The animations here are great.
prbly the best episode of hot ones ever
Conan was Da' Man with Da Bomb!
Love Conan 😂 Legend
Man's a maniac! He'll drink acid if it makes someone laugh. What an absolute LEGEND
This is the best hot ones episode of all time. The build told a story the build to conans insanity.
Oh epic😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What a maniac....HAHA
Best episode 😂
YESSSSSSS!!!!!
Mans came on Hot Ones and was like “ok but what if I just no-sell all the wings”
This show just peaked right there… Holy mother what a performance! I‘m in awe…
Conan is unhinged 😂
Whomever dares to tell/nag/lecture Conan about what to do for "_any_ generation's" entertainment interests/attention, do what he just did with Da Bomb before ever ever uttering another word. Can't wait for the memes/clips to come out of this one.
Conan O'Brien just set the bar for Hot Ones and it may quite possibly, never be topped!  Truly the GOAT!🐐 23 Seasons of this show and no other guest came even close to this, just annihilated those wings!
Incredible just Incredible 😲
I think Conan just shattered the white people can't have spice stereotype forever. That was astonishing.
Conan is such a beast! But, his toilet will be feeling it in the morning.
He basicly dissed them all and got away with it 😂
This has to be THE most unhinged episode ever. God I love Conan so much.
This is why Conan is one of the, if not the, best latenight talk show host EVER.
This is quite something, especially since Conan is a picky eater.
I can’t remember the last time I laugh-cried so hard watching an episode of Hot Ones. Definitely one the greatest IF NOT THE GREATEST episode
That was legendary!
“What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I feel?!” 😂
Conan is the craziest guest yet on Hot Ones and I am loving it!!!
Best episode
YESSSSSSSSS The one we've been waiting for!!!!!
Finally someone takes advantage of the "I mirror whatever the guest is doing" statement
This had to be the greatest Hot Ones EVER!
nothing will beat this
I can see the hot sauces tearing down more and more of Conan’s walls and inhibitions. Layer by layer, until there is only pure unfiltered Conan.
Conan is the GOAT
Lol 21:14  this is so chaotic and I'm here for it.  It's giving me Chris Farley vibes.
As an English teacher... LOVE the last part, "READ!" Yes!!!  Thank you Conan!
I've never seen Elon be so funny
you should have asked him how he really feels about jay leno
LEGENDARY
This might be the greatest Hot Ones episode of all time!
Most people interviewed barely make it through the last dab...  Meanwhile conan drinks out of the bottle...
Jordan Schlansky next?
OK, Conan is the most epic BAMF we've ever seen on the show
Instant classic. Haven't laughed this hard in ages! 😂
This is a Hall of Fame episode. No doubt whatsoever. In the top 3 at least.
Greatest Hot Ones in history!!!
Leave it to coco to trump every single guest to date
I absolutely LOVE Conan!  So happy he went all in for this one.  The constant call backs to the Doctor and the pocket wings.  Chef's kiss.  Thank you as always Conan!
This was the best and will be the best hot ones ever done!! 😂😂😂
Bro just mainlined Da' Bomb like a boss. Mad respect to Conan.
Conan is an absolute Legend! Two of the best interviewers on the planet in one spot - and they are killing it. This is even better than the Gordon Ramsey episodes.
what a great entertainer
Been waiting for this episode forever. Now we just need one with Prof.
I see how Jerma picked a few things from the legend himself. His anticts really reminded me of him.
Best episode ever... conan rules
That Ice Cream part reminded me of the tongue in cheek arrogance of Dr. Disrespect. Now that would be a sweet guest. Maybe not the best for views, but that would be good.
That was hilarious
That was kind of hard to watch.  Conan, we love you but you have to know you're crazy, bro.
YASSSSSSSS...... "WAneeeeeeee wanaaaaaaaaaaa"
comedic genius. love conan.
Conan that was crazy!
16:53 Conan channeling his inner Joker
Insightful. Disgusting. Hilarious. Conan.
That little animation of the water buffalo was great!
Conan is the craziest mfk out there
Didn't this kind of behavior send Coolio into a couch coma? Conan is built different.
Conan is such a talented comedic talker. His story telling is far and above almost anyone else.  That was truly incredible
Go ahead Conan, drink da bomb… go ahead drink it all… 😅
How to go save the show?  "If you're not sure, the white freckled guy is the cure".
Conan is such an amazing guy. It's just not fair to compare to anyone else xD
GOAT
I was blown away at Conan's compliment.
Finally!!!
I am looking forward to watching this every day for the rest of my life. Thank you.🔥
UN.HINGED! 👏🏻
Yes! CONAN!
Conan is the hot sauce GOAT!
Conan went HARD. Hilarious one. Took it better than almost anyone.
Conan: "I'm not locked in here with you; you're locked in here with me."
Best and funniest episode ever 😂
Wth how am I only knowing he's going to hv a travel show now???
Best episode so far. It will be hard to top this one.
Just wow
This has to be the best, most chaotic episode yet!! ❤😂
This was incredible
Hahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣 sooo funny!! Conan is a legend
In the year 2000; in the year 2000! I love Conan! 😂😂😂😂
Conan really is one of a kind! What a great episode!
Can't believe after all these years i find out we share a Birthday. Love the Conan and miss the show.
First time I see that Sean couldn’t mirror what the other person is doing lol
Conan is the absolute GOAT
This is the best episode hands down lol
Best one in memory. Superb.
Conan is one of the few people who get physical comedy right and never once has he failed to make my gut tremor with pain from laughing.
Boss!!!! He destroyed those wings!
best one ever
😂😂😂😂 protect Conan at all cost!
Some people say that this is a good finale. Well the good Conan has had a lot of inspiring farewell monologues, this one being the best. What’s in those wings? Magic?
Is this the best episode ever?
This was the best one of all of these in my opinion
😂😂😂😂😂😂
love this guy man
Conan may just have moved Charlize Theron to my second favorite Hot Ones episode. He was hilarious
Invite Leno on the show, so this episode can become even more memorable in retrospect and just settle it forever.
The best interview yet! And Conan still mentioning Finland years and years later <3
Conan is a national treasure. I wish one day to meet him and further feed into his chasmic ego. 😂
So how does any guest top this? Do a Da Bomb enima?
I CAN'T.  It feels like he's paying homage to Regis Philbin.
Is that water buffalo thing true? I gotta see that…..
Conan is an actual cartoon character. Legend
Conan and Paul Rudd are the pinnacle of hot ones episodes imo
This is a hall of fame, top 2 performance. And it's not number 2.
Greatest guest ever! Great job Hot Ones!
Might as well end the show and call this episode the finale.  There is no topping this.  Best episode ever.
Coco thanks for all the laughs man
This is legendary
I have been a Conan fan for decades, and have watched just about every episode of Hot Ones, but I had absolutely no clue that was coming. Magnificent.
one of the funniest ones.. tbh
That ending though. I don’t know whether to laugh or look away in disgust 🤣 I love Conan.
Charlie Rose!  .ha!
What absolute chaos. I adore it.
Charlie Rose with Hot Wings new name of the show
Wow just WOW!!!! 😂😂😂❤
And there it is. The single greatest episode of Hot Ones, which I have watched since its inception. I could not stop laughing at this committed fool of a man. Glorious.
wow
Conan is the Man! Awesome strong fella!
Not funny, not at all, I don’t get the fuzz, huge cringe. I had to stop bc it turned disgusting to watch.
He is just crazy 🤣🤣🤣👌
This episode is wild.. just wild.
He went from pale to nearly pink. Wow
This is THE BEST we will ever see!
Conan didn’t tank the pain. He rode the pain to glorious insanity.
This is literally the best hot ones episode of all time
turned into chris farley lol
Conan is the GOAT
I love this show and most if the guests, but this was the absolute best. I love love Conan, the most.
From the back he kinda looks like Trump, lol
Definitely on the Mount Rushmore of hot ones interviews! I didn’t expect that one bit!
El mejor episodio de todos
This episode should be called, Hot Ones Redemption, with Conan O'Brien...
This is the best Hot Ones interview I’ve ever watched, Conan is an icon!!
that was a performance!
Conan had me dead laughing. Hahahahaah. 😅💀 So funny!!!!
Best episode ever 😂
Conan is the GOAT. Im not entirely sure of what but airs something.
Conan the GOAT!
Absolutely Amazing. Thank you to Conan and Hot Ones for making this happen. Hot Ones Gold ladies and gentlemen. Well done!!
GOAT before, GOAT after
For me he's the best guest you could've had. Pure entertainment.
This is the greatest episode ever.
what a Legend!!
Good to see funny Gordon Ramsey!
16 minutes in and I'm still waiting for this to get funny.....
i love conan o brien
The best show so far, this was amazing
The Best First we Feast .....probably forever!!!!
One of the best episodes yet.
Research shows that redheads have higher pain tolerance, Conan just proved it. WOW Bill Burr next season?
Finally... Conan's the best
If Conan could make it that far, he could handle the food his producer Aaron Bleyaert cooks on his Twitch streams.
i like conan
This and Shia is the greatest episode ever 😂
Greatest Hot Ones Episode with a legend. Loving this comment section
hilarious!
outrageous behavior, hilarious !
Conan is truly a comedy genius
Hahaha
Is Dr Arroyo affiliated with Dr Vinnie Boombatz?
Good luck topping this episode
Ed Currie (creator of Pepper X) has an equal now and I'm happy that it's Conan. They are both equally insane!
Conan is a legend! I have loved him for years! This was amazing to see! He took those wings like champ....a deranged champ, but still a champ!!!!😂😂😂
Oh wow.. I haven't watched much of Conan's work lately and I'm astonished that he's, in the most positive meaning possible, allowing himself to age now :)    He's still super-witty, he's still in tremendous shape, but more human now :)
Bring the Rock on !
Amazing episode
"I can't get used to it. It's not a better name!" THANK YOU! Who let Warner Bros / Discovery approve this name change? It's dumb and less recognizable
Just reload this one again in place of the IceSpice one . Totally night and day.
conans doc is brilliant.
CONAN WAS - IS -AND WILL ALWAYS BE !!!!!THE MAN!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾😊
One of the things video essayists talk about in regards to conan is he will adapt to being the funny man or the straight man depending on who he's with. I didn't really expect that to be a rule of inverse proportionality... Sean might be the straightest straight man, in some ways, and this might be the wildest I've seen Conan!
This was an experience. One of my fave episodes.
Still waiting for that LA Beast episode...
Hilarious AF 😂
Never before have I seen Sean so terrified as on this last wing. It's like he thought he'd encountered a genuine madman.
Haha!😁
Holy Mother of F*ck!!!!!!!!!!!!  CO is certifiably insane... LOVE IT!!!!
Conan is funny but probably not very tasty.
I doubt anyone can top that
That is a legendary performance 🎉
Conan: Can you get a baseline pulse? Doctor: It's there.
😂 has anyone ever done that with da bomb 😂
This has got to be the best episode besides the one with Dave Grohl. Conan killed it!
Jesus Christ this is surely the best episode ever of this show! My face is hurting .... 😂
Wow what a transcending episode, unmatched😂😂👏👏👏👏👏🤣
Conan did what Steve-O never could with so much grace.
This was unhinged in the best way possible.
"I get that from everyone in your demographic, 'Ooooh Conan!'" 💀 roasted a whole generation
Conan is a savage 😂
What I love is that this will be some peoples’ first introduction to Conan O’Brien
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MY WHOLE LIFE
Thanks for making my day. Favorite ex-late night talk show host, second favorite interview. Of course, no one will beat Dave Grohl.
Now can we get some video of him of the 24 h after he did this to himself.
Conan. What a ledgend. incrediblemepsiode how can any guest beat this?
last time someone tried stuff like that ended comatose in the green room
Conan never fails to bring it.
22:54 Sean looks so concerned, he probably thought he was going to be responsible for the death of Conan
I've been watching this show from the very beginning. And hands down, this is the best episode of this amazing show! This where this show peaked. It's gonna be difficult to top this. Conan o brian, take a bow.
Love the comedy. The messy eating, not so much.
I did not have Conan O'Brien as the guest who would go full rockstar on the hotel room. Love it.
I am in awe of the man. Is he having pure fun? Is it just a bit? Is he having a mental breakdown? Has he lost it? Is he high? 😂 We will never know and we will never stop wondering 😅😅
Just the Best Conan #1 🔥😂
Top 3 funniest interviews ever 😂
This one is years late.
This is how you do it!  Conan just completely unhinged.
Dude deserves a place in the Hot ones Wall of Fame.
I was not expecting Conan drinking from the bottle of sauce hahaha what a beast
WOW! Love this channel. Never commented before but WOW! I was in tears! From the UK but Conan should create a show over here!
Hilarious 😂
Didn't he say the LAST episode was with Shakira. To Shakira herself 😅😅
The Conan tornado did not disappoint 😂 What a legendary episode. Glad we ended the season on a high note after that dreadful Ice Spice debacle🥶
Dude's always funny
This was the best ever!
Conan, as always, succeeds at being as weird as humanly possible. Fantastic. Never change.
Nice to see Conan bring his former writer Jose with him!
This episode sums up 100% of why I love Conan so much 😂 Entertainer to the core!
Conan’s a comedic genius fr lol
Must be the best episode of hot ones by FAR! NO ONE DOES IT BETTER! Conan for the win🔥
Best interview so far! Comedy gold
Can Conan and Sean go on an adventure together. I feel like it would work well.
I've been enjoying Hot Ones for years now. I have never laughed as hard or as often as I did watching this interview. Conan really has no equal.
Conan is insane!! 😂😂 In the best way possible!!
16:44 The man is a LEGEND... and a BEAST... and a bit of a lunatic. Best episode ever.
0:32 if thisa guy says hes 100 percent irish im gonna set fire to my computer. hes 100 percent American
World class 😂 Conan is made for this show
My king 👑
This was absolutely incredible. What a killer man. Force of nature.
I used to stay up later than I was allowed with my brother to watch Conan and Andy drive their desks around town.  Conan was and always will be a king of comedy!  👑
I think it's safe to say that Conan just won Hot Ones.
conan on sundae conversation would be like father and son
Hot Ones has jumped the shark/ nuked the fridge with this finale. good job everyone.
Conan went harder and more unhinged than Eric Andre
Conan went completely feral 😂😭💀
This was the greatest episode ever! What a madman!!!
Conan just tripled the bar for this show! THE BEST ONE EVER!!!
This is one of the best yet
I can't believe they both kept their jackets on the whole time. Usually people are sweating hard by halftime... lol
OH MY GOD YES
best ep
I'm about to start this video. My body is ready
CONAN
Conan is one of the few funny talkshow hosts. I really hope Hot Ones will get Bruce Dickinson, the lead singer of Iron Maiden on the show. He would be amazing and interesting.
Best episode ever
Best episode of all time. Conan is the funniest person alive
If presented the opportunity, I would have his babies.
What an absolute legend.
Dafuq did I just watch? I absolutely did not see that coming.
Aroyo is the most all right affordable doctor 😯👍  I’ve had a blast watching this season finale I did not expect Conan to do that What a champ, two champs on the circled table.—Three! Three champs! You can’t forget about Dr Aroyo!  Will definitely tune in April 18   I could also picture Sona just face palming xD.
THIS ISTHE BEST INTERVIEW AVE EVER SEEN ON THIS SHOW . . ..CONAN IS A BEAST TO THOSE WINGS
Heading to MAX 😅
Best episode of hot ones ever
Wait ... what!?  Is Conan shoving half-eaten wings in his pockets like a 6'4" millionaire orphan!???
One of the greatest show ever second to Gordon Ramsay.
I hope they talk about this on Conan Needs a Friend. Conan got loaded 😂
Ive been watching Hot Ones for years and this is the best one by far. Conan made the entire interview into a comedy sketch, he is a genius
Best episode yet!!
Happy birthday coco
Pure gold 🥇
I usually never comment but this show was GREAT
His mouth gotta be on fire but he's ignoring it for the bit. True professional.
Team Coco forever!!! 🔥❤️
Legend.
conan is a cerfied legend
The pure, unadulterated chaos is absolute gold!
I laughed so hard 🤣 What a legend!!! 🙌
This was great!  I love Conan
Having watched Conan lick hot sauce off his hands for nearly 30 minutes all I've got to say is this better not awaken anything in me.
Sensationell!!!
WOW! That was something else! In-cre-dible! 😯🤯
Best episode yet.
I havent laughed like that that much on a hot ones episode in awhile god thank you for Conan
Hilarious, high energy, bodies the wings like never before, then drops some deep knowledge at the end.  The GOAT ladies and gentlemen.
cut the budget... I don't think youre gonna get a better guest after Conan! ❤
Conan is not only a national, but an international treasure.   What a legend. What a crazy episode.
Of course conan comes in like a rocketship and makes the best episode to date. Team Coco!
F*CK ME!   Conan's harder than that guy who just ran across Africa! Who'da thunk it?
you know youre teamcoco for such a long time that you immediately recognize arroyo when he came out!
Man I love Conan
BEST EPISODE! HANDS DOWN
That was delightfully unhinged!
No episode will top this
Didn't just not dissapoint. It exceded all I wanted. He's the greatest. Utter Chaos and comedic genius. Not to mention bustin' through the wings the best since David Blaine.
I feel like Conan cosmically channelled Chris Farley for a second and I love it. This is Conan to the Max.
Soooooo are we going to mention that water to milk edit around 17:20 ????? Is it all a lie Sean😂😂😂😂
I've been thinking it for years, but I'm going to start asking: Can Sean Evans talk just a little bit slower? What's the rush?
What did he do to train for this? Pepper spray himself in a sauna?
Not for me...  Over the top!
"The other guy" oof
2:45 "By the end of the show, You'll know nothing, you'll learn nothing, and you'll be happy"
I love that Conan is turning red from screaming and being Conan and not from the sauce 🤣🤣🤣
“The other guy” he won’t even say Leno’s name.
Conan is going to need that bidet Jordan keeps bringing up with that ending.
Should've brought Jordan Schlansky with Conan
😂whats wrong with me i can feel😂😅😊
Best episode. Conan is 🐐
Conan for president 🇺🇸
the man is a monster from another dimension
Conan will never cease being a legend! Man puts 100% in whatever he does.
I'm calling it now Conan is the best guest ever on hot ones
the fckn best one ever lol
Conan said you can't predict the future, but I would have definitely predicted that the Hot Ones episode with THE Conan O'Brien would be the greatest episode ever, and I would have been correct.
so is nobody talk about the fact that Conan drank from the hot sauce 14:00 ? CRAZY I love him :D
This is the greatest episode of all time easily
over 9000 for sure
top 3 hot ones ever
LEGEND
This is easily the best episode to date. I love those other ones blah blah blah this one is crazy the best.
First episode that I watched twice in a row, incredible show, Conan,  good sir,
Sean seems scared of Conan’s sheer madness. He is the goat
Conan bullying Sean for not having spicy enough wings is hilarious
Man I love Conan that fools so funny
Legends say he's still not feeling it.🥱
ill have whatever hes having before the show xD
Ayo conan is on shrooms 😂
I see conan, i clicked extremely fast.
This.was.amazing. well deserved
I didn't know Conan would be on Hot Ones. But I'm very happy he is
This was wonderful
holy eff conan is the goat. god i love that guy, thats how you gotta live. better to be silly than boring
I think Hot Ones has peaked. Sorry to all future guests.
Andy Richter next!
Oh here we go 😂
Best episode, period.
Mad man' the man. 😂best yet 23:34
Either Sean has allergies or you can slap some icing on him and call him cake bc he looks baked. When the camera just shows him, look at his eyes lol...maybe im just high. Also, this has to be one of the best interviews. Conan is a legend. I was hoping he would do that little dance thing where cuts the invisible string. I miss it.
This was incredible!!! Conan is the greatest! 🙌😂
I was excited for an unhinged comedic interview and I was not disappointed. And we even got a bonus bit with the doctor who may or may not be an actual doctor.
Conan's bits are just pure gold. They are so good.
BEST EPISODE, props to conan and sean!
...Conan Obrien hilariously mauled by a bear the next time he inadvertantly wears his Canadian Tuxedo jacket in the wilderness. (insert materbating bear here)...
The best part is that he acted like he is not used to spicy food at the beginning and didn't show any reaction until he had an insane amount of Da Bomb.
I've never been a fan of Conan's comedy and I find him very off putting so this interview was very difficult to get thru.  I do appreciate that you could tell he was genuinely sincere on his compliments to Sean and I will admit it is impressive he was able to make it through the gauntlet.  I do respect how he values and supports his staff but his comedy is not for me.
I will LOVE Conan FOR LIFE!!🤣🤣🤣 HE SHUT EVERYONE DOWN WHO THOUGHT HE'D BE OUT BY WING 1!! NEVER doubt the late night GOAT!!!🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 On a serious note, I can listen to his stories for hours❤️ Conan is the best! And this was the BEST EPISODE EVER!😂
TEAM COCO 💪🏽👊🏽
I normally watch Hot Ones for lunch time amusement, and sometimes I smile or laugh, or respect an answer and enjoy the conversation.  But dear god, I haven't laughed this loud at a hot ones episode in ages. This was absolutely fantastic.  I swear last week's episode with Shakira had a comment around it being the finale, but here this is, and it is wonderous.
This was amazing, top notch on many levels, the build-up, the chaos, masterclass comedy, turning pain into comedy in real time. I also loved the bewilderment of Conan at the applause at the end, he almost looked genuinely surprised to be getting such an applause for that display, haha. I have to thank the algorithm for seeing this one, and reading the comments here, it seems that i might have just seen the best episode ever. Every time i watch a Conan video, i ask myself why i still haven't subscribed to any of his channels, he always delivers.
You could end Hot Ones right here. Ain't nobody topping Conan.
This is the first time I seen someone defile da bomb instead of getting defiled by it 😂
Legend!
please tell me Jordan is making an appearance in the new Conan remote show.
Funniest Hot Ones ever!!!!
going through those wings like a boss.. he needs to eat the ghost pepper now... i would like to see how that goes.. another great episode and season!
FINALLY!!
my fave white person thanks hot ones
Yes!! Finally, this was the funniest episode ever
This man spread hot sauce on his t*tt*es . The best episode.
We need outtakes from this episode asap 🙏🏾🙏🏾
I am I the only one who thinks this Hot Ones was WAY overdue?  Conan may have retired from his show but he's still comedy GOLD!
love it, the goat
This was the best Hot Ones episode so far.
Just sitting down to watch this.  I already know this will be my favorite episode ever.  Keep cool my babies.
"What you're gonna read, read widely, read well." :')
CONAN GETS IT . Actually the GOAT of Hot Ones . The MAD LAD
Possibly the greatest hot ones of all time
k, this is the new best guest ever now.
I can't even name the second best guest anymore, but Conan has blown away everybody else that preceded him.  On a side note I am now convinced that having a 100% Irish genealogical line is what you need to avoid the ramifications of these insane sauces
I was thinking, "please someone warn him before he takes a drink of DA Bomb".  Turns out it wouldn't have helped.
Let's goooo!!! Conan all the wayyy!! 🎉
This is as completely unhinged as I’d hoped it would be. Absolutely amazing.
Just love for him ❤
This is the funniest interview I’ve ever seen
Conan showing up in complete character, immediately doing bits is exactly the kind of defense mechanism I'd expect from him
First time in a long while that something makes me laugh out loud so much that my body hurts 😂 Conan is a legend - what an interview.
The goat is finally here
I grew up watching late night shows in the 90s and if there was a hot ones scale for them back then it would go Leno 🌶 - Letterman 🌶🌶 - Conan 🌶🌶🌶🌶
Bruh, Conan was WILD
Conan aces his final interview for the job of US cultural attaché!
Conan is another level of spice lord.
Love Conan
My stomach is hurting from laughing nonstop .   😂
This is the best interview hands down.
This was absolutely incredible 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏👏🫡🫡🫡🫡 Conan is amazing
You’re forgiven for Ice Spice. This episode is the new gold standard.
So commited. Love it. That's a lot of physical damage for a comedy bit.
This was amazing! I'm wondering what Conan did to his mouth was that the same stunt Homer Simpson did with the candle wax ? 👏👌😂🤣🤯🥵🤬
DR. ARROYO  SHOULD HAVE WALKED IN AND SAID  "' HI EVERYBODY "'   AND ACTED LIKE DR. NICK RIVIERA.  😂😂
That's going down in hot ones history.... I love that redhead!!!
Quite possibly the best guest ever.
Conan wins
This is Robin Williams-level insanely funny. One of Conan’s most amazing moments ever.
Incredible. Im not sure this will be topped anytime soon; a bittersweet feeling.
20:27 I live to hear conan say this sound effect
13:23 - “They look like separate distinct times in my career.” The humor in the episode blew me away, but this was one of my favorite serious moments in the show.
We've all been waiting for this!
this is a top 5 episode easy
I have heard that redheads have a high tolerance for pain, etc., I guess Conan just added credence to that notion! Lol
Best one I have seen in a long time. Well done Conan.
Funniest episode i've ever watched, holy mack.
This is amazing. Great early bday present. Been wanting Conan on this show for so long. Cheers!!!
🏆🏆🏆
Funniest episode of the show
I think he left his tastebuds at home.
So there was talk of gerbils...
We need a after the show episode showing an hourly check in on Conan
I NEED a TV show with Dr. Arroyo, Dr. Spaceman from 30 Rock, and Dr. Fishman from Arrested Development
Best episode
Best. Episode. Ever.
LEGEND!!!
This is the best episode yet. I laughed so hard. I’ve watched it like 3 times now.    Just a historic moment in entertainment
Conan will be POTUS one day
You told Shakira she was the last of the season lol
👍🏻
Finally good guest.
Sean was absolutely shook
Oh my god. Sean has to retire after this. How could this possibly be topped?
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
There has never been a better guest! I think Conan just typed Ramsey!
God I was dying laughing, Conan is a legend
Conan transformed into various stages of pink/red throughout. Truly a metaphor for his evolution through his carrier
Conan is such a beast, I want to see more of him!
Wow. Conan just made Steve O look like an amateur
I've been watching Hot Ones since season 2, and this was the most amazing show yet.  Conan.  Legend. Wow.
We made it. This is absolute peak
Well, this was epic!
Oh....I love Conan. He is the GOAT.
Love you guys ❤
Eva zu Beck went to the Arctic Circle and she was awesome
Literally last night, I was listening to Sean on the H3 Podcast and thought "You know, Conan would be a great guest on Hot Ones, but I don't think he'd ever do that." The next day, my wish has been granted.
Conan crushed it and earned a whole new level of respect
Can not stand this dude !!!
This was the perfect mix of lunacy I never knew I needed 🔥👏🤣
Absolutely best episode in a while. Didn't think Conan had it in him to hit the sauce that hard!
Conan should play joker
Probably the wildest episode ever.
In future episodes, Sean will interview wings who take on the Conan of death.
Conan is an S tier guest GOATED
i wish icould give you a million likes and if this does not get that then people have not seen it
Can't believe someone dethroned Bobby Lee as the most unhinged interview hahaha  Conan is goated!!!
I like this. Here from the Philippines😂
Can't believe they had Tarja Halonen as a guest, this is next level.
Now he needs to go on Last Meals with Josh!
Conan gives his all for our enjoyment. Thank you Conan ❤ great episode
Dude...
Just passed Dave Grohl as my favorite interview.  This interview is the opposite of the Ice Spice interview.
Funny but disgusting at the same time 😂😂😂😂😂😂
My god I love Conan 🤣🤣
06:21 - Did he actually call Jay Leno _"the other guy"?_ 😁😅🤣😂
I don't think I need to watch another Hot Ones again...Conan nailed it!!!
Conan O'Brien is the best there's ever been.
When he first mentioned Max I thought "Oh he is working with Wineburg again" That is how old I am.
I grew up on tasteless food🤣🤣🤣 O MY!!! I no he is crazy but jeezzz🤣🤣🤣You where very brave Sean !! You survived a tornado !!
love him
respect
Conan says he wasn't the slightest bit affected by these hottest of hot sauces - and yet his voice kept getting louder and faster, and his banter went fully insane...
Omgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomg
Conan! Conan! Conan!
This is peak Hot Wings! 😂
Best episode ever
Conan is such a ridiculously likeable person.
Perfect.
I’m so happy. So very happy.
MAX Weinberg is doing good for himself, starting up a streaming service.  Okay, i gots a question, do the scoville-levels stack since i see that the wing wooden plate had some of the other sauces on it.
best show on hot ones!
Undisputed goat 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eric performance
This was absolute gold!! 😂😂
this is it. this is this show's peak.
That was mental - what medication is that guy on ... Columbian marching powder?
Yeeeesh. He went hard to the paint for comedy.
The real hero of this situation is Liza Powel O'Brien , if she decides to keep the O'brien name after this
conan jacket fire
Instant classic!
This is everything I would have wanted it to be
This was by far one of the best episodes of Hot Ones thus far.  Stuff very rarely makes me actually laugh out loud and this did it.
I Love Conan
CONANNNNN!!!! My dad introduced me to the simpsons and the late show as a kid and now Conan is a staple in my life for comedy. I HOPE Jordan is in the MAx show......... PLEASE GOD
A God of a Professional. Conan, we do not deserve you.  😂❤
Conan 🥹
BEST EVER😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We just gonna skip over how he put the wing in his pocket? 😂😂😂
the doctor and the wing pocket are the two best bits anyone has ever done on this show
😂 peak
If could hit that like button a thousand times. I'd be pressing it all day
I need this episode's highlights turned into posters and merch stickers
This is without a doubt my favourite episode of Hot Ones. Conan O'Brien is a legend!
Conan was born spicy, this challenge is trivial at best!
Actually foaming at the mouth at the end, the Pepper X made Conan rabid.
Best over the top show ever!  Conan incarnated Chris Farrell, Robin Williams at least!  Trust the hangover is not as bad as I think it might be!  Well done C!
Jenny Ortega needs to come back and retake the crown.
Why didn’t they show the water buffalo clip?  Doesn’t Conan own the footage?
wow! Conan for the win!
21:15  I've just had to pause the video. 😆
I have watched all these episodes as they came out and have loved each and ever one of them. And I have to say this is BY FAR the best episode you have done Sean. Well done!  And Conan is a living legend
Funniest episode bar none. I never expected this to happen!! 😂 "When you have lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock" 💀💀💀💀
That was magnificent
I want to see Craig Ferguson bad! Please make that happen@!
I think Conan has to be my favourit guest of all times. What an icone.
This episode will be nominated for an Emmy, Oscar, Bafta, Nobel, Pulitzer and Peabody.
Conan went in saying “I’m willing to die on camera”
YES
Conan is a great physical comedian, has great timing, is a master of the absurd, and is so fun to watch. He is also a great interviewer.  Can't wait to see his travel show; he needs to travel with Steven Yeun again. They were an awesome duo.
Conan...... give me some of your wings.
Conan is without dispute the greatest talk show host ever
Best episode
This was unhinged. He did the spice version of getting on a water buffalo 😂
Literally best episode ever!!
Da Bomb oozing out lol!!
Dr Arroyo rocking a Railmaster on the wrist!
Conan can just make anything funny, truly one of a kind. And dare I say, one of the greatest of all time performances on Hot ones.
He has a travel show now?! Conan remotes are so funny I can’t wait
conan is a mad man !
Finally, a great guest!
"Can you get my pulse?"  "...yeah. It's there."
Conan my goat
I want to like Conan for all the cool stuff he's done, and I don't know why but it just doesn't work for me, and this interview cemented it.  No hate on the rest of you, clearly courses for horses here.
This was the best and most impressive episode of all time
Spreading Da Bomb hot sauce everywhere has to be another water buffalo moment.
Nice, nice
The best episode to date!!!!!!!
If Conan was still on tv Jimmy fallon/ Kimmel would be unemployed
One of the best if not the best Hot Ones episode of all time.
Do we know if Conan survived???
I"m starting to feel it now.... (Also, his nose is running... so yeah). Great episode!
Sorry I really don’t get why people find Conan funny. His comedy is cheesy, loud and unoriginal.
I’ve never been a huge fan of Conan and his style, but this is one of the greatest episodes of Hot Ones yet.
Dr. Arroyo: Hi Everybody!  Audience:  Hi Doctor Arroyo!
This will be the most memorable episode ever.
Talk about a guest that understands the assignment
This is how we found out Conan has COVID 😂
He has always been my favorite late night host!  He is just more my generation's sense of humor.  Love this dude.
The hot sauce pouring out while Conan leans frantically over it looking like a mad men telling a tale, very funny 😂
CONAN doing his best ROBIN WILLIAMS impersonation.
Greatest entertainer ever
Conan  as Letterman was robbed from the NBC late night job.
Not gonna lie, I thought Conan was going to one of the all-time strugglers, but to see him pour Da Bomb on that wing has cemented him as one of the all-time greats in my opinion.
no puedo creer lo que estoy a punto de ver, esta loco. no digo lo que va a hacer para no dar spoilers :P
LOL 19:20 “He’s….not real”
What a legend
a true LEGEND. we love you conan!
that was incredible.
This was such a good episode. Great choice for the season finale.
I was not going to watch the show he plugged, but I feel like I have to 😂
Pretty sure that was John Mulaney’s drug doctor lol
ABSOLUTELY EPIC!!! Best Hot Ones Episode EVAR!!!! This cannot be topped. Conan is a freagin maniac and I love him!
This is the most insane interview you have done so far. Good luck to the next season finale topping this. 😂
Nice to see José Arroyo again. Love how he's a doctor AND no longer has a first name
Conan is out of his mind and I love it!😆
Bring on Larry David, please! 🙏
Lol he took that like nothing lol
THIS IS GOING ON THE HALL OF FAME OF BEST EPISODES
Best hot ones episode 😂😂😂
I never knew a train could go so fast off the tracks. This was epic!
Conan is a god among men.
Just brilliant. Conan is a savage. Always goes for it. Bravo
I’m rolling laughing 😂
Whats he gunna do with the leftover chickens in his pocket
Conan is truly a professional and an expert at his craft. Wow 😂 unbelievable.
Now this is how you promote. 👏👏👏
I feel bad for Conans mom. he must have been an absolute nightmare as a child lol
Wooooo finally! 🍻
I love Conan! Can we get Jordan on with Conan next time?
This is the GOAT episode.
Conan is awesome.
The fact that Conan followed SHAKIRA to close off the season is something he would’ve loved to know and brag about.
dude.
Only Conan could give an actual touching speech covered in drool, milk and hot sauce.
Simply the greatest comedian of all time.
That was INSANE
Best episode ever 😂
Incredible episode. Conan is a true OG and genuinely funny.
Absolutely entertaining and classic Conan! Keep him in a museum! Love the show and don't miss an episode. By far a favorite episode! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
He is chaos incarnate.  😅🤣🤣
hahahahahahaahahah hoooly. CONAN IS THE GOAT!!!!!!
Effortlessly, relentlessly funny
Jose!
What an absolute legend. 👏👏👏
I cant stop laughing in the office
Oh yes 🎉 CONNIE .. hurt his liddle lippies ? GOD BLESS YOU ,YOU ALBINO FREAK …. ❤️
When I subscribed to this channel years ago I knew it would someday pay off. Even after it got sidetracked pretty bad. This was the day. Next season, bring in Bruce Campbell so I can die a happy man.
The best to ever do it
I didn't think there was a way for me to respect Conan O'Brien even more before this episode, and I didn't expect this was the manner I'd respect him more, but here we are.
Conan just put on a Comedy CLINIC while in agony. He's a 9th degree hilarity black belt. Bow to your sensei.
Conan has always been so hilarious
His "OH MY GOD" reaction is hilarious. This was a fun watch.
This may pass up Gordon Ramsey episodes! Amazing!
"The other guy.... ya know" Conan won't even say Leno's name! lol  I love how Conan says his style of comedy is kinetic. I instantly thought of the 3 stooges and then he later references the stooges. As someone who grew up watching the stooges, Conan is one of my two favorite late show hosts, along with Craig Ferguson.
its hard to tell if the wings are effecting conan or if he's just being himself 😂
This was hilarious
this was the most epic episode ever.. i love conan! what a legend!
Holy moly... 😂 I was having a terrible morning, that certainly made it better. Comedy gold.
Conan is the funniest person on the planet!
Conan is the final boss  Top performance
Licking the Bomb off the wing is epic😅
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen!!
I feel like if Steve-o was in the room he'd be like "dude, calm down! You're gonna hurt yourself"
I'll miss you Conan😢
His face changed color! 😂
Will the real savage please stand up, lulz.
5:27 😂🤣💀
Trey Parker and Matt stone when
Wow what an episode 😂
Unhinged.
100% the best Guest Ever... Conan#1
Bro came in determined to absolutely destroy the leaderboard of hot ones interviews and that he did... Hats off to Conan
Right off the bat with the doctor, this is gonna be GOOD!!!!!
Awesome show,  must watch episode!
Titan
Sean's face at the end when Conan asked if it's about to peak
The absolute best.
Best one ever!
YESSSSSSS i’ve never clicked so fast
that's my GOAT
Legend.
Dude is non-stop funny!
my love for conan is unquantifiable..
Wow
Not quite a genuine effort, but a very funny performance.
This is worth waiting😂
I always get emotional everytime guests acknowledge how great an interviewer Sean is, I mean no fail. And coming from no less than Conan himself! Another proud dad moment for me, and I'm not even a dad!
Best Hot Ones EVER!!!!!!
I’ve thought about this a lot and other than Dave Chappell, Conan makes me laugh more than any other comedian.
I'm so happy that we are getting so much new Conan content now 🎉
This may be the best episode you have ever had. Conan O'Brien is a Legend.
Unpopular opinion, Conan is the only good Late Night Host.  The man is just an absolute phenomenon.
11:33 "The water buffalo and I made amends. We're good now... It was delicious." Is what I was expecting him to say, for some reason.
This guy is savage AF!!! Give the man the medal and a biscuit!! His Irish blood got the best of him. He shut the show down. Its pointless from here on. 22:20 he’s bonkers. Hes round the bend Hes batshit crazy. Someone must have offended him by implying he is a poorspur, he is probably doing all this nonsense as a revenge
Legend 😂❤
"What's wrong with me? Why can't I feel?!" had me rolling lol
Conan is a national treasure.
Unhinged gold
Eric Andre at the end there
The "mediocre president" question that calls back to the time Ralph Wiggum played George Washington was perfectly overlooked - this was the best episode ever!!
Conan is such a legend, starting off with a great bit even before taking a bite. Can't express how much I love him
If someone created a montage of the complients Sean received b/c of his interviewing skills, it'd be 20+ mins. I love hearing his guests CONSTANTLY tell him he's a great interviewer...because he is. And he deserves every accolade he receives. Sean's intereaction with his guests is why I watch this show.
I hope he goes over the side effects on his podcast. Interested to see how much damage he did.
I can’t believe he went out BUT Steve-O didn’t do this 😂😂😂😂
Oh My Goodness 😂😂😂😂
I'm so happy that we are getting so much new Conan content now 🎉
good lord.....i wanna see Coco do the one chip challenge!!!
17:18 Jesus may have turned water to wine, but Conan turns water to milk
Helluva classy guy..
Absolute best
Conan is a legend, love him
As a conan fan, I am going mad!
Best guest next to Gordon Ramsay.
This episode is going straight into the pantheon, along with Gordon Ramsay, Key & Peele, Eric Andre, and David Blaine
He just F the heat bar and raised it up to supernatural level.
🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Best Ones
the toughest man ever CONAN O BRIEN
I love this guy lol
I don't watch Hot Ones often, though I like it well enough, but this is peak Conan. The thing is, it feels like it's also peak Hot Ones because Conan tries his best to elevate whatever he's on in his own weird way.
That is the gastronomical equivalent of jumping on the back of a water buffalo. 😂
Dr. Arroyo put a stethoscope on Sean’s tongue and said “its not good” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I haven't laughed this hard in a long time! 🤣🤣🤣 Thank you Conan!
This was the Godzilla X Kong of interviewers we didn't know we needed. What a show......
Conan starting to look like Robert Smith from the Cure halfway through with those red lips!
Absolute favorite episode
Conan is now GOATed. There is no debate.
The bar has been raised to an insurmountable height! No way anyone can top this performance. Coco is the GOAT!
Wow.
Gotta love Conan! Over there looking like Trump's lost cousin.
Yes yes yes. Long live CoCo
BRAAAAAHVO
Conan telling Shaun what a great interviewer he is must have been like the best thing ever to Shaun
Best one ever
Sean gets complimented a lot but you could tell when Conan said he’s a great interviewer he got that shock factor cuz he such an incredible interviewer himself
Pure chaos. There is nothing like a totally unhinged Conan
I love this show.... and this is the greatest episode ever!!!
now i wanna see Conan eat the hottest pepper in the world. This episode was great.
Of all the sports in the world, Conan O'Brien is the greatest.
The Best Episode Ever
All timer
Best episode of Hot Ones ever. Conan is just magical!
Het american gember haar 'Brother from another mother' om Gordan Ramsey, of niet?
Conan went full Conan and I'm all here for it.
It's gold.    Had me rolling the whole way through~~!!!!
I'll be back (hitting the replay button).....
As a fellow Irish person, our favorite spice is flour. And when we want to kick it up a bit, Mayo.
That's was amazing😂😂
Thanks Conan! 😂😂😂😂
WOOOOW GoConanGo!! 🤘
This was EPIC!!! Best episode of all time
Call the wife!
I need more Conan now.
WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Da Bomb holding up throughout the years. Even Conan started to falter.
EPIC !
Without doubt, the best ep of Hot Ones ever created. Unreal!
I don’t know what I was expecting but can certainly say this exceeded all expectations
The best
very casually just slips a wing in his pocket - now continue the interview like it's normal
FKN love this guy, Conan u r good to.
Just unbeatable
I wish this was longer!!!
Its beyond logic to not like him. Brilliant!
The first wing drop in all of history, dropping da bomb!
Best episode ever. 😅
As soon as the doctor showed up, I knew this was going to be an epic interview.  I knew in that moment that he understood exactly what he was getting into and he was sincerely happy to do it.  Just the largest compliment an icon like Conan can give.
So now they can honestly cancel the show. They will never have a better guest or episode.
😅yeeeeeeeeaaahhhh!!!!!!❤❤❤
This is one of the best episodes of all time 😂
I wish we could have Chris Farley on this show
Conan... best hot wings ever by far. Didn't complain and went all the way. Awesome episode by far.
The best one 😂
Conan is awesome, always have loved his shows, no one will be able to top this one.
Behold, Conan the conqueror
Conan is the GOAT
Where is Jordan!?!?! 😂😂😂
The words ‘above and beyond’ spring to mind. Fair play, Conan 🫡
Conan went for it!!  Unreal!!!
Man, Conan is seriously not funny.
Da G.O.A.T.!
I have literal tears coming down listening to the way Conan ends the episode. 🤣🤣❤️ You are so funny, Conan.
He gonna feel it later I hope he took some acid meds
The Absolute Best Episode!! The Commitment of Conan in this episode is Legendary!!
This is the best hot ones I’ve ever seen.
I freaking love Conan. Still the best talk show host by a mile in my opinion.
man i love conan so much
23:00 Conan is the joker
It was intense 😅
Conan beasted the wings and the episode
the greatest episode of all time! You’ve reached your pinnacle
He was shaking
This is freaking awesome!!!!!! Love how dedicated he is
The water buffalo story, holy tamole!
my man Conan 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Check my pulse!..... It's there😂😂
Hahaha Conan is always amazing! Loved all of his skits when he was doing late night back in the day.
Ahahahahah. Conan is a legend. 😅
Best late night talk show host ever, honestly.
Insane
If any episode needed a ‘careful around the eyes’, this was it!! This was brilliant 😂😂
Conans face turning red LOL
I have watched since day one.   This is the best episode I've ever seen
I listened on headphones to hear Sona's laugh.
top 2 interviews to date. Now all we need is Kat Williams
Instant hot ones legend!
6:58 This compliment, coming from this man, is insanely high praise!
That was so funny!!
This may be tied with Gordon ramsey for best hot ones interview
Wing After Wing Conan Turned Into The Joker
Conan, we know you're a comedian, you don't have to prove anything. Or perhaps I'm just not your audience.
I feel like there is something wrong with Conan, but if there is something wrong with him, I hope he is never alright. He is too good. I just wanna hangout with him for a day, that would be amazing.
That's why he sings "waneeee wanaaaah"???? Literally my whole life I've been hearing him sing that and I had no idea it was the three stooges!!
Where else would you find this character. Long live Conan!
there's at least 5 things Conan did that no other guests has ever done on the show. Instantly the goat show and absolute funniest!
2024 has been my Conan Renaissance 🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂 HE'S HILARIOUS APR 18TH LET'S GOOOOOOO💯💯!!
I love Conan so much, but I legit thought that he was gonna die. 😂
Conan is one of the GOATS, no matter what is going on in life he always puts a smile on my face
Conan set the tone from the very beginning in the best way possible. Much respect. Great episode!
Man, 30 seconds and it's already one of the funniest episodes! :D
Conan single handed devoured all the fear about these hot sauces created by this show over 9 years. RESPECT 🫡
Sean, you can retire Hot Ones now
Conan is good but the duet with Jordan woulda been better..
Finally a good guest
Straight to top 5
My god! I just watched someone drinking Da Bomb from the bottle...
This has been the best recent episode ! i can't stop laughing. Conan is a legend
Spectacle
I came to Youtube to watch a different video I was excited for, saw this video, and IMMEDIATELY clicked on it. I dont even remember what the other video was.   Been looking forward to Conan for years! Amazing episode!!!!
Absolutely epic.
I used to work for a zoo (decades ago for decades) and during the 90s, our zoo was the Conan O'Brien show's animal people.  Conan and Andy are just normal guys, and it was fun to meet them.  We were on the show about a dozen times (as well as Regis and Kathie lee, the Jon Stewart show, and The Tonight show with Leno.).
i need an interview after this interview where Conan talks about what he really felt eating and drinking those wings hahaha
One of the best yet for sure
.....legend
Pooped well, Conan? ❤
The best show ever😂
Best episode Ever!
Thank you for getting a great guest, for once.
Best episode ever!
Conan and Craig Ferguson are the GOATs of Talk Shows in my opinion.
Hahahahahaha.... HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA.... Sean - Do a fresh chili eating video with you, Chili Klaus and Conan! This was top 10 videos ever made on YT! HAHAHAHA F-ing Conan just going full tilt! Epic! And you just kept feeding him and egging him on! Good job!  Also - Conan won! He just made off like a bandit with a pocket full of chicken! 😀
Conan is truly the GOAT 🐐 🍗
This ist the best and funniest show i ever seen... crazy
for the algo
Frothing at the mouth
there is no soul in obriens eyes
In true Conan fashion, this was somehow both exactly what I expected and nothing that I expected at the same time.
As Epic as we'd all hoped!
I hated this. Couldn’t watch more than half
CONAN!!! 🥰🥰🥰
RIP Bea Arthur.
The reverb on that Ric Flair "WOOO" hit like a truck.
2nd hand burn on this one
"Yeah, it's not good."
I thought it couldn't get any better than Dave Grohl. I was wrong.
“Hbo max changed their name to max cause it was too popular” ☠️ rofl
Josh Brolin vibes on this one!  Crushed it.
Legendary.
I've been waiting for Conan and he did not disappoint!!!
Best. Episode. Ever!
Legend.
Conan = GOAT
The best one yet
Conan continues to be the best
What a BEAST! Best episode ever!
Best episode by far 😂👏
What a great episode. Conan is the best!
This has got to be one of the best, maybe besides Ramsay. I love Conan. I love this show. Perfection.
This is the best one for sure! ❤
Conan has lips?!?
Conan ❤😂
Hands down the BEST episode ever. My wife is dying as well. 😂
What have you done... Conan's pure wildness now beats Gordon Ramsay's interview and becomes my favourite episode of Hot Ones!
how did he do that?
Conan took a Homer, and has candle wax in his mouth
Death fears CONAN💀 Man, what maniac he is, Absolute legend 🙌
I knew Da Bomb would take him down a couple pegs. Great interview
bruh 😝
my salute to one of the all time greats mr O´brien lols royce^^
well that was amazing XD
absolutely soiling that jacket💀
"yeah, it's not good." lollll this doctor's comedic timing is fantastic
Best episode ever
I would have picked him over fallon
Conan is a crazy man and I love his off the cuff comedy, and his weirdness, like bringing a fake doctor to the shoot.
By far, one of the funniest episodes.
My father's 80th birthday is April 18th...🎉
Now THIS is entertainment!!
What just happened. 🤣
I wish Norm MacDonald were with us to do this.  Conan is amazing. I'd love to see Kevin Nealon give this a go.
I legit thought he was go n
This was great, so effing funny...thanks Sean, the crew and of course Conan 😂
Shoutout to Conan for the best performance ever. GOATED
one of the best shows so far
Easily a top 5 episode!
Conan never disappoints. I love you so much, man
The perfect level of madness. You could write an entire thesis about the socio-psychological buffet on offer with this one 😮.
LOL  Dragging Jose Arroyo (one of Conan's writers) in to act as a doctor . . . so good.
This pleases me
This is one of the greatest episodes of HOT ONES. Outrageously funny.
I think it has to be the most sauce consumed ever, in the show's history....right?
thats the energy
This is one of the best things I have seen ever
melissa stratton next!
Watch this show since the day one !!!!! I’m a real fan of this show hands down this is the best episode ever!!!!!!!$$$$
I didn't think there could be a worse guest than Idris Elba.
This video was amazing!!! Conan O'Brien brought it!!!
Best one yet 😂
Protect Conan at all costs
I think we can all agree Conan is the best interview there has been
I need whatever brand of long lasting lip color Conan's make-up artist used.  Conan and I could be sisters!😊
Petition for Graham Norton episode.
😮😮
I was crying laughing watching this one. 😂
That's it! Ain't nobody topping this one! Conan is the best one ever!
man, Conan is a legend! this has to be in the top five episodes of Hot Ones
This was amazing!
This is THE MoST AMAZING HOT ONES EPISODE i have ever seen. 😅
Is Conan still alive today?!? 😂 That was insane!! No way he wasnt hurting the next day
The legend of Conan is not yet complete.
I'd like to see Jimmy Fallon try Hot Ones. He won't be able to fake-laugh his way out of it.
Best one yet !!
My favorite!!!!!
I was expecting Andy Richter to eat the wings for him 😂
When can we lose the covid era double table setup? It's odd to see them separated by a football field distance.
Two hosts trying to host each other. Conan saying "is there anything i need to know about smokey j" to try and get Shaun to talk about and promote the sauce. Both absolute professionals.
Conan is light years better than the current crop of Jimmys and of course Leno. Only a very close second to Letterman imo.
The best episode ever?
Conan is here...THANK YOUUUU😁😁
Objectively the best episode of all time
This is the best hot ones of all time
FINALLY his face matches his hair
Amazing
Conan woke up and chose violence
Conan is a freaking maniac!! Lol, I love it 😅
@21:13 "CALL THE WIFE!!!!" 🤣
I’ve been waiting for this one for a LONG time! Finally!!!
wild!!
Conan is the goat
Every guest thats ever been on this show just watched him douse, eat, and lick Da Bomb, and instantly felt feelings of inadequacy. 😂
Conan absolutely smashed it. 😂
Love Conan!
As soon as I saw Coco, clicked the video so quickly. Awesome interview, Sean. Almost forgot you were there. Kaidikai!
Sean's lowkey kinda starstruck in this one
Conan is the GOAT!  How is this man always funny and entertaining?!
easily the best episode of all time.
Wow!!! Not a word, that was insane!
Wait a minute... isn't that doctor the one who played 'darth maul' in one of conan's star wars bits??  😂
16:31 Conan O'Brien eating da bomb hot wing
Best episode ever! Conan is the sauce boss!
The best episode of the season
Conan... what a man 🥲
God bless Connan 😂
Greatest Interview out of all the seasons…ever!
Who had "Conan O'Brien goes 3x as hard as Steve-O on hot sauce" on their Bingo card?
Most Irishmen cry at Tobasco sauce. Seeing Conan go the distance and not tear up while Sean chokes at the heat proves just how powerful Conan is.
His rant at the end about comedy was just….true.
15:01 — "...I'd have also said there's no way there's ever going to be a 'Charlie Rose show where you eat hot wings". –Conan  Only a chosen few will get this hilarious reference.
Is Conan still alive? Im dead laughing🤣
Weird seeing Conan try so hard with bones in the pocket, and the doc because dude doesn't have to try, so him pouring and licking da'bomb, yeah, ok
did you get conan clearance?
Uhuy conan o'brien euy
Best Hot Ones interview to date! Conan is insane in the best way.
Best. Hot ones. Ever. Someone please send a copy of this episode to DJ Khaled...😅🤣😂
I have been waiting so long for this episode, and it didn't disappoint one bit. Conan is out of his mind 😂
Conan is unhinged.
Don’t step on my brown suede jacket!
This is a hall of fame episode. The fact that Conan is still this funny, and this energetic at his age, THE GOAT
No one actually believes these celebs are still eating the real wings, right? That hasn't happened for like 5 years.
WING DROP! WING DROP! Funk flex voice
Let’s get Markiplier on here!!
Please make a follow up documentary about Conan’s post show experience 🤞😬🤞
The stethoscope on the tongue KILLED MEEEE!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
top 5 eps ever
What a coincidence this drops a week before his new show...
That is the best episode ever! That will echo through the ages until time itself concludes!
This is hands down the best episode ever
Wow this was peak Conan lol the pure insanity and commitment to going over the top but also giving genuinely great and thoughtful answers. This dude is a one of a kind comedian I love it.
You might as well call this the series finale, because that's what it felt like. No way you'll be able to top this one any time soon, Sean.
HANDS DOWN...THE BEST episode to date. I was howling during this!!😂😂😂😂 Conan is THE MAN.  LONG LIVE CONAN. ❤❤❤
The best episode ever imo
Best one to date! Love conan!
This is the best episode of Hot Ones
Wow!!! This is Hot Ones GOLD!
And this is why conan is the GOAT
Yeah alright, I’ll watch his show 😂
Conan is a real life simpsons character I swear 😂
Conan's spice tolerance level surprised me on the same level as the Elizabeth Olsen episode.
Conan has the most Hilarious Antics! LEGEND!
RIP Conan
I just peed my pants!!  Hilarious!  I hope you’re OK Conan!!  A new bar has been set for next season!!!
Best guest ever!
Conan’s energy level is still unparalleled and he seems like a genuinely good dude. One of my favorite episodes, instantly.
Jesus Christ this is the most a hot ones episode has made me laugh. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conan...fireworks to you. What an amazing show.
This is easily the greatest episode of Hot Ones of all time
The perfect comedian for this bit!
LEGENDARY episode. Up there with Paul Rudd and Key & Peele.
worst guest ive ever seen on here
A masterpiece.
Best one yet!!!
Going to watch this twice...the first time to eatch Conan...and the second time to Sean watch Conan.😅
cry laughed majority of this interview.  Conan is such a legend.
I never expected to cry-laugh at a Hot Ones episode. Thanks, Conan.
❤
The only way this could have been better is if Sona was the doctor
I'm losing my mind watching this. I love Conan so much.
Dear @firstwefeast  add 5% noise to your renders... it'll stop all the noise in the black backgrounds
Never in my life did i think a pale 60 year old Irishman would be the most legendary host in the Hot Ones.
And this is how Conan died🫣🫣
About half way through I thought to myself, "Man, Conan is really wild." I had not seen anything yet. This man is a legend.
watched Sydney, skipped everyone else this season, and finally a real celebrity in Conan.  maybe the worst lineup of any season ever.
with Da Bomb overflowing at the end...hysterical
Haven't even begin to watch but I just know that I'm going to enjoy this one! Oh and thanks for the 10k likes 😅
I love this one so very much.
21:06 is all you need to see.
My legit reaction when I saw Conan O'Brien on a Hot Ones thumbnail: 21:07
conan is incredible, forever the best late night host
what a legend!
😂😂😂 this was sooo freaking hilarious 😂😂😂
When Conan O’Brien compliments your interviewing skills, you know you’re doing something right!
god i love conan
This is INCREDIBLE
I clicked so fast
Spitting out a mouthful of milk: “They used to call it HBO, but people found that too popular.”
That was f#*£ING EPIC! NEW HOT WING CHAMPION!
This was the beast episode of hot ones history!!!! Conan is the goat!!!!
This one's going down in history.
Who's playing the doctor?  Do we know him from something?
Conan is truly the GOAT 😂😂😅
i read somewhere redheads perceive pain differently.....maybe that can explain his INSANITY
Very funny and cool..woah
#1 episode
I don't know who pulled the wings off better Conan or Jenna Ortega lol.
I can handle my hot sauce, and Da Bomb is pretty intense (at least for me).   What Conan did with that wing was pure lunacy.
SHOULD'VE BROUGHT JORDAN SCHLANSKY TOO!!! WE LOVE YOU CONAN!
BEST HOT ONES EPISODE HANDS DOWN 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yay Conan !!
Conan is an absolute beast! Best interview ever! 🔥
Conan has and will always be the GOAT
Dr. Vinnie Boombatz was Dr. Arroyo's great grandfather.
Somebody call 911 loll
What did I just watch?
Conan is just the best. Absolute madness 😂 His show has been airing in Finland for all my childhood (whoever in this godforsaken tundra of a country made the random decision to air his show in the year 2000 deserves a medal of some kind) and I've followed his antics ever since. Well played, Hot Ones.
Conan is the most unhinged!!😅😅😅
This is the best performance you can get out of this show! What a finale. Can't believe what I just wittnessed.
The camera pan back to Sean's face in horror looking at Conan is priceless 😂
I think if you pause it just right, you can visibly see the moment Conan realizes he's *ACTUALLY* insane 😂
So proud of you, O'Brien, so proud of you.
Conan is such a monster, there is nothing he won't do for a good laugh.
This was the BEST episode you guys have ever done.
One of the best guests ever!  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉   “WHATS WRONG WITH ME WHY CANT I FEEL” 😂😂
Easily one of the most UNHINGED and AMAZING episodes of Hot Ones..
ngl...i thought they would need to call the ambulance...this guy is insane
like a boss.  Best guest ever.
YES THIS IS EVERYTHING
Conan O'Brien is a national treasure. Someone stuff him and put him in the Smithsonian.
Way to close out the season. This was wonderful!!😂
The most CHAOTIC hot ones episode in history 😂😂
I’ve never watched Conan until today…I dunno what I just watched, but I LOVED it. Haha
Conan’s understanding of how to take a real life situation (not a bit) and give it an arc in the moment where it starts and end like a sketch is truly unmatched. True comedy legend.
what a fiiiiinaaaaallleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.. CONAN delivered..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Finally we see the GOAT!!
Killed It! 😂
Conan is now the GOAT of Hot Ones
The last dab
BEST EPISODE EVER!
Holy moly! Conan owned the show! One for the books for sure!!!
Conan is such a ballistic idiot lol
Best episode yet 😂😂😂
Legend!!!!!
Conan really is the goat so far on hot ones
It was all fun up until he turned disgusting. Talking with food coming out of his mouth is just not funny. What a shame,was really looking forward to him being there.
Dude killed it. One of the best so far, seriously!
Wow!!! Best show yet!
🎉🎉🎉
EPIC!  Best episode eveeeeerrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GOAT in the history of the show
I'm not even done watching and already know this is the greatest, most shocking, wildly entertaining episode of Hot Ones ever. And I've seen them all.
That was a HOSTILE TAKEOVER.
*eyes bleeding*   “I’M FINE!”
Easily the greatest episode of this show ever made, and this is a show I love with a lot of great episodes
Conan is a god!
for the first time i see sean crying
hey hey la pimenterie, Montreal represent 🤘
Is it just me, why do I feel inspired after this show?!?!   We see tasks as, tasks.... LIVE LIFE! MAX IT OUT
THIS IS THE BEST! CONAN!!
Conan is king
ITS FINALLY HAPPENED
Can you force your audience to laugh by just going insane on set?  Turns out, yes.
This made me like Conan???
OMFG! Conan is the goat!
Hate state the obvious...conan is a God
Conan is effortlessly funny. He's my fav talk show host.
i’m waiting for him to intentionally touch his eyes
This is what the whole show has been leading up to. Now we need footage of the next 6 hours after this interview. The suffering he must have gone through...
Best Hot Ones YET! That's how it's done.
Conan is the most insane guest since steve-o. I was totally not expecting him to beast the spice so much. I can't believe he rubbed the sauce on his face. What an absolute maniac. He didn't just conquer the wings of death. He obliterated them.
How is this comedy? Just grossed me out
Such a great interview!
That was amazing.
This has to be one of the best interviews the show has for all these years! All expectations surpassed for this interview! Mad respect for both Sean and Conan!
Sorry Andrew Tate, Conan is undoubtedly Top G!
Can I leave 2 comments on this? It was deserving of it. He got toed the line so well. Took us right up to the edge of too much but strangely it I'm at the end feeling it was just right. Fantastic.
best guest appearance in Hot Ones History
The best episode on this show.conan is timeless If u watch him after 500 years he will still be entertaining
Hilarious how we are in this ridiculous era where it’s socially acceptable to make fun of white people for not using spices in their food, which is sooo obviously not true at all. It’s just black and ethnic people being racist toward white people.   How many black people suffered on this show or tapped out early? Meanwhile the whitest dude ever can handle the spice like it’s nothing.   Sit down, brown skins.
love Conan!
Goat hosts
Conan really jumped on the buffalo in this episode.
Legend 👊🌋🔥🔥🔥
A man of the people. The comedic voice of my childhood and adolescence. Thanks for having him on.
Da bomb still undefeated, great show!!!
This episode is simply the car crash that you can't look away from. Easily the most legendary episode of hot ones next to Gordon's.  What a beautiful disaster😂
This is an incredible end to the season! 😂
The pure chaos and unhinged comedy of Conan O'Brien is truly genius. His face and hands must have burned for days.
Don’t travel Texas
I am SHOCKED Conan missed the Sona joke with “Smokey j”
Conan out here just flexing on DJ Khaled.
They are both great interviewers. Conan is a legend, you can't ever say he does anything half-assed.
Hands down the best episode
MAX. Rolls off the tongue. 😂
I knew this would be a good one... LOL
I feel like this one kept Sean on his toes lol
I thought no one's gonna beat Paul Rudd but man... This is next level!
Conan does in fact, always commit to the bit
Conan should probably have gone to the hospital after this 😂
Hands down the best episode of all time!
That was really bad...
Just amazing, Conan! **wing drop** 🥵🌶👏
Did Sean lick the DaBomb wing too?
Please tell me Conan is okay after all that hot sauce ???
Oh my god😂
Best episode
☠️😂
😂😂😂😂 never seen a spice until 52
"travel texas" lol yeah no thanks.
Best episode, ever
Conan brought the human version of Dr. Nick Riviera 😂😂😂😂 It’s a condition where the skeleton tries to leap out of the body!! 😂😂😂😂
I just puked part of my breakfast at the end of this episode. Equal parts disgusting and hilarious
Call the wife! hahaha. He channelled his inner Steve O in this!
❤ love Conan ❤ this is one of the best hot ones I have ever seen 😂😂😂 he is one of my favorites ❤
“What’s wrong with me why can’t I feel?”😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Uhhhhh is Conan still alive or did he go see O.J. in heaven?  The juice has expired :(
Conan is a Beast!!! LOL
its still wild to me that nbc robbed this man of the tonight show
Impeccable.
OH MY GAWDDDDD
Your color grading is absolutely terrible
Eric Andre just became the most sane guest
The idea that Conan did hot ones and was playing it all macho because he wants to stay relevent to the young people is beyond funny to me... I was dying during the end
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who knew that Conan was a secret Spicelord
This legit made me hot watching
Did he pour wax in his mouth beforehand? haha, legend.
God I love him
Suomi mainittu😂
"Max" IS kind of personal. It feels weird.
Conan is a god!
He's such a raging lunatic! 😂 Happy Birthday Conan! 🎂 🎉
Conan would never disappoint! What a legend 🎉👍
Oh my god, that was hilarious.  Conan is the man!
“Can I keep these?”
Definitely a GOAT episode.
I grew up watching Conan and the way I adore this man 😭
Conan goes straight into the Hot Ones Hall of Fame - no voting needed!
best hot onces episode ever.
If this isn't the peak example of masochistic suffering for the sake of comedy, I don't know what is 🤣 I don't envy the clean-up crew, though. And RIP Conan--I'm sure you didn't survive the aftermath of that, especially in the care of Dr. Arroyo.
This was hilarious
This was definitely one of the best. Hilarious stuff!
Best ep ever, hands down.
Greatest Hot Ones episode of all time
Can't beat this, Conan's inspirational speech at the end... I love Conan. Although like Sean, I did get worried when he started drinking hot sauce, but luckily Conan brought a licensed M.D.
Conan may be THE BEST GUEST EVER here on Hot Ones!
To think that we had Ice Spice a few weeks ago. This was a master class of an episode.
HOLYYYYYY
I think this is the last we see of Conan, I hope that was an actual doctor 🫡🫣🌶️
Thanks for the genuine gut laughs Conan
Sweet Jesus! Conan’s a madman! Glorious!
Legend, absolute legend
conan understood the assignment
I don't know if it's just me but this sorta makes the impression that Conan finally lost his mind...
Classy. A well read Harvard gentleman doing his thing. Down to the milk drool.
Thanks again @FirstWeFeast for introducing me to the Secret Ardvark hot sauce, still my all time favorite!
The best guest ever! No surprise...
best hot ones yet 👏, Conan never disappoints , natural comedian
23:00 😂
Easily on of the best episodes!! What a great finale!!
Wow, this interview has got to be one of the best. I laughed so hard, tears were running down my face. I literally yelled "NO" when he ate the bomb like that. Crazy!
now compare this with a Kimmel or Fallon hot ones smh
What a maniac 😂
The stuff he said about Warren Harding was true. I looked it up.
I'm not sure what I just watched but I'm gonna go for it again 😂
That was hilarious
Another reason why Conan is the absolute GOAT. Another instant classic episode
Absolutely legendary. LEGENDARY.
100% pure nuts ❤‍🔥
This show has reached his absolute peak, everything will look simple and boring from now on. 😂
Best guest ever. Conan is a machine
Conan is the GOAT
Now that's committing to a bit..I know not a bit..💥😅💥
Like a boss.
Best episode ever lol
Conan is a f🦆ing legend, what a way to finish the season.
the last 5 minutes were so fkn gross. I wish Conan would grow up as a human as well as a comedian
Conan have been My all tyme fav of all tyme! I wood stay up late every skool night just to wach his show! Then be asleep all day in class! Who need skool anyways!!
This is genuinely the funniest hot ones of all time
Conan O'Brien? Smashed the like button before I even started watching.
I'm just gonna say it right now. Conan is THE BEST GUEST you've had. Barnone!
This has got to number one, as the most INSANE show in Hot Ones history. CONAN DISTROYS HOT ONES. Long Live King Conan.
Conan is the real deal
Seems like he has heat going on in his life. 😂
I am loving Conan's press tour right now! Pretty sure this is his show now, hahaha
i have always loved Conan, now i respect him even more, hahahah
so why did they cast jaquin phoenix and not conan?
Sean, you HAVE to get Craig Ferguson on Hot Ones now that you've gotten Conan. He's the antithesis of everything Conan did in showbiz, and yet they're both the most genuine comedians ever in late night.
Conan is an all time great. Considering how good he is he is the most underrated comedian in the business
What a show 🎉
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan O’Brien became Conan O’Burning.
I can only guess but I reckon the level of lunacy in this interview would have only been rivalled by Robin Williams 😂  Complete chaos and I loved every second of it!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Conan may not outlive the show he’s promoting 🤣
100% hands down best episode of Hot Ones ever made.
Conan one of the best talk show host to ever exist.. no one today compares.
Conan has to be the best wing eating interviewee you have ever hosted. We all know he was acting that way, but he suffered through it like a champ.
Realized Conan is practicing what he's preaching here. Even if it's going poorly, you don't say that. You just keep acting as it's going fine. Conan is sweating like a shower but pretending like it's completely fine.
I'm pretty sure he used some sort of numbing agent:l
All hail the true king of entertainers!  This the opposite of phoning it in.
I LOVE CONAN! That's awesome you brought him to the show! :D Thank you!
Before even starting the episode I can guess this one's going to be as iconic as Gordon Ramsay's episode. Here's hoping 🤞
O man I love Conan!
GENIUS.
there will never be a better episode of this show than this one right here.   ladies and gentlemen, this is the end. this is the end of dog racing.
Connan was 100x better guest than Gweneth Paltrow
I didn't know I could laugh/respect Conan more. Comedic legend. Sean, way to be excellent and let him do his thing.
Conan is a legend. There's people whose entire personalities are little more than Conan quotes and mannerisms - and I'm okay with that.
Hands down the most wild episode. I was rolling in laughter.
Complete beast 😂
This is it...this will be de one...
So.. Hot sauce is a myth ?
EPIC
Best episode ever. Classic Conan
Never underestimate Conan!!!
This is beautiful. One of the top ones. Fair play to Conan for feeling alive and giving it 110%! I salute you.
“Dr Arroyo, he’s not the best, but he’s affordable “ 🤣
His face got as red as his hair!
Maybe it's just me, I love hot ones, but I found this whole interview tasteless and disgusting and I lost any respect I had for Conan, showboating for the sake of showboating...
No other guest has prepared for Hot Ones like Conan, the bits keep going.
I dont think I have ever seen Conan this...unhinged...
why hasnt Conan being cast as the joker yet?
Conan never ever disappoints. :D
He might be an alien.
Who else felt like a proud parent when Conan very sincerely told Sean he is a great interviewer 🥲 I mean, we all know it, but this is coming from GOAT
The names of all the sauces are right in front of him yet he asks what they are called. Lol
I love Conan. Extremely brilliant.
Wow hat was impressive but it's called a napkin man, good god!!!   xD
I haven't liked a video before I watched it in a decade, but this one got it.
"Da Bomb" era Conan was next level.
What a beast. He should enter those chili eating competitions.
Thumbnail brought me here 🤗
I've been a fan of Conan's for a very long time, but I think I can finally see why he was picked to take over for Letterman so many years ago. Yes, he's funny and brilliant, but it's his sheer tenacity that allowed him to get through the first few years of Late Night that you see on display here. Of course he was in agony, but he just powered through it to serve the show.
This is the craziest one yet, loved it
Man, Conan’s just the absolute best isn’t he
I love Conan! This was way better than i anticipated. 😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥
Unhinged Conan is the best Conan
This was amazing
GOAT episode. Wild ride, as expected.
I love Conan!!!!
I have NEVER seen something so intriguing and beautiful...
Conan is a beast! To Conan O'Brien if you ever read this comment: You are the G.O.A.T. Absolute Nr. 1 living Legend!
This was freaking awesome
1:49 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i love that he treats Leno like Voldemort and refuses to say his name, only referring to him as "the other guy."
Conan is one of the most entertaining people of all time.
I've never laughed so hard at an episode of hot ones lol
Never seen someone rage-eat wings on the show before. 😅
2:19 "Can I keep this?" 🤣😂 That's a first. Conan shoving the half-eaten wings in his pocket cracked me every time!
Conan is the GOAT of hot ones, brings a comedy routine to the place. Takes over the interview and is hilarious. ABSOLUTE LEGEND
Conan was just goated. This is better than the Gordon Ramsay episode. Absolute legend.
Let's see Leno do this!
CONAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!❤❤
6:55 I'm so happy Conan said this. Sean really does so amazingly and getting a compliment like that, echoing what we say in the comments and have said for years he really deserves that so much. Especially coming from somebody like him💞
An immediate, all-time, best.
Best episode ever !!!
I love Conan O'Brien is legendary, his work is just superb.
Conan has officially conquered the wings of death! Congratulations to a legend!
Legend.
The irony in conans concerne for a doctor being present is amazing!
Sean's look of pure terror and pain after Conan drank from The Last Dab was hysterical. Conan is a God.
Conan the master
Conan made history right here.
Charlie Chaplin speech moment!
Wow. What an episode! Truly a legend.
A collision of my 2 favorite talk show hosts
6:00 “The other guy” referring to another talk show host (Leno?) sounds like smoke!
Conan is a madman, hahaha
Gotta love a man that commits to the bit!  I don't think I have ever seen Conan this red before!
With the severe hot sauce Conan is resembling Cesar Romero.
Yes! I love it, Conan delivered on everything and more!
He looks like he's wearing lipstick after he started drinking the hot sauce lol
I *need* that awesome blue shirt Conan is wearing. Somebody help me!
There are no words, this is perfect
Killed it!! New favorite episode
he gave me Robin Williams(RIP) vibe
Episode like never before. Epic comedy. All hail legend Conan O'Brien 💪🏼
Easily the best episode of Hot Ones to date.
As a huge Conan fan, this has to be the best finale to a Hot Ones season I could ask for.
Best Hot Ones ever
Easily the best episode of Hot Ones to date.
Conan is the last quality talk show host. He's amazing!
Conan O'Brien is the best. 😂😂😂
this is maybe the best hot ones of all time
King Conan  ❤❤❤
Of course he brings a Doctor bit to the show. Genius! So happy Sean finally got to Conan! Two of the best hosts in all of media!
Sean needs more interviewers on the show.  I wonder how Graham Norton would take the hot sauces 🤔
Literally unlike anything I’ve ever watched before.
yay I got the 5,970th comment and I feel great
Seeing this episode gives me an inkling as to how things might have gone down if Robin Williams was still alive and had been on this show.
YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHH! I'VE BEEN WAITING TO SEE CONAN ON HOT ONES FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE FOREVER! This is too awesome. :) Edit:  Even in my wildest dreams I don't think I could have imagined how this interview would unfold. I thought Aubrey Plaza was wild and crazy! I think Conan has made a new record of wildest, funniest, craziest, zaniest episode ever. Oh, and he blew the 'how the hot sauces were dealt with' record out of the water too. I think was the first time anyone put more Da'Bomb on the wing?  What a TRULY EPIC way to end the season! Thank you SO much for doing this interview, Conan!!!
Best hot ones  Love Conan so much
Conan 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I want to know what Dr Arroyo's been prescribing!?
What just happened 😶
Really enjoyable to watch, laughed a lot, but would love to see an interview where he wasn't doing a bit, or playing it up, not sure if you would ever see that from guys like that in public, much like you never saw the real Robin Williams behind the mask an incredible man who suffered quietly
What a ride
21:24 that whole little part right there reminded me of Chris Farley
man conan got old
Today is rhe day i FINALLY found respect for Conan. You go gurl!
I never thought I would see Conan O’Brian’s skin be as red as his hair!🤣🤣
-"You have to commit to the bit" -"This is not a bit this is life, don't say ComMit tO The BiT"  He is on another level. Master.
Idk what was considered the best episode of hot ones before, but this has clearly topped it. I never watched his shows and I don’t even know much about Conan.
I hope this was his last promo and he cleared the following 48 hours...
Asking if he can keep the wings is more hilarious than the fact that he's keeping the wings lol
For an Irish Catholic who grew up with bland food he did amazing!!!! Dang I thought he would die. 😂😂
so proud conan
Legend
Comedy genius
The stethoscope in the mouth is so simple but so funny
Ok but seriously, this couldn’t have been a better finale and I genuinely don’t know if any guest is going to live up to this interview. Is this the peak ?
the best
clearly one of the best interviews... top 5 for sure
I hearby declare Conan the "Boss of Sauce"💯🔥
That was something, completely not expected... I guess now I know Conan O'Brien!  Lol
Best guest of this season!
Now THAT is entertainment!
this is the hardest I've laughed for an episode of hot ones
Conan on the wings is the 180 degree opposite of DJ Khalid 😂
All that talking just to distract from the fact that he starting to look more like his Madame Tussauds figurine than his Madame Tussauds figurine lol
Unhinged Conan is so manic and this is peak unhinged Conan mania!! 😂🤣😭💀
The doctor seemed like Fred Armisen playing a doctor lol
This was amazing, I don’t think I’ve ever laughed through an entire interview 🤣🤣🤣👏 I love Conan
His doctor must've gone to the University of Science, just like that one professor of logic
Conan brought it on this one
This interview proves why Conan is the greatest. He was the only late night show I watched as a kid from ages 10 and up. His ability to keep it interesting is seriously unparalleled. He can make lemonade out of nothing
GOAT
Lol newest greatest episode period.
INSTANT CLASSIC. So funny.
Duuuuude it’s the legend himself! So glad he came on here
El mejor episodio de todos
Audibly gasped when he poured Da Bomb. Conan is the goat, and tier s in hot ones power rankings.
I think I blacked out from joy while watching this
Goodness gracious....
Man has Rick vibes
"Can I keep this?"  Puts wings in pocket 🤣🤣🤣
Conan is truly the best I love him with my whole being
Incredible episode 😂😂😂😂😂
*checks pulse* yep, it's there.  When you lie on your resume and get the job. 😂😂
Bro. THE funniest hot ones to date. I started SCREAMING laughing in my office when Conan start rubbing the sauce all over. Bro omfg 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This was absolutely amazing, laughing the whole episode
This was the best episode to date
Sean was not ready for this
He sounds like young Frankenstein
We were all waiting for Da Bomb and it did not disappoint
never thought id see Conan one up Steve-O.
Best Hot ones of all time!
21:55: And his is like Macy’s on the 4th of July.
Okay guys, it's a wrap. No other guest will ever top this.
"I don't fear your wings man... bring what you got"
Conan is wild! 🤪
the redhead trait of not being bothered as much by spicy food,at least by 12:33 is on display.
Conan is awesome I hope he continues to grow
"Comedian and talkshow host Conan O'Brien died today, after eating 30 trillion scoville units in 20 minutes. You can see the last few brain cells tragically dying in the last 4 minutes of his Hot Ones episode, although doctors still argue if he was insane before committing to his interview. He will probably be missed by someone, maybe."
Conan's eating fast as if his brother Neil is sitting next to him,
the only thing missing from this was Andy....
Best episode ever. Thank you!!!!!
Conan taking a covert snipe at Jay Leno at 6:26 lol
Having that kind of compliment from a man like Conan, Sean and the team were in clouds of happiness
I CAN NOT BELIEVE THIS CONAN IS KING
Wow what an all time Conan moment!!!👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
This is hands down the funniest episode so far. Conan is a true living legend that just elevated his status to God level. Thanks for entertaining me and RIP to yer guts.
Conan O Brien is a tough mfer . Jesus that da Bomb thing was nuts . We are not worthy … we are worms
Best Episode Ever. Period.
The God doing it right
I feel There are more closeups of conan than any other guest.
Conan really is one of the kings of comedy. Such a unique style and is able to always bring great energy. Amazing episode one of the best on the channel!
I hope Jordan, Matt, Sona and David are on the other side of the camera
The best Hot Ones guest and it won't get better from here
I’ve never laughed this much in anHot Ones interview. My co-workers are probably wondering what is wrong with me in the office rn ☠️
Amazing. What a great interview. I love Conan.
I love how, even in his madness and bit about not feeling the wings at all, he still had to cave in and admit Da Bomb had a kick; Da Bomb truly is the worst - it even broke Conan's bit!
🤣🤣🤣I did NOT expect to enjoy this as much as I did.  Amazing showing from both Conan and Sean.   The level of commitment Conan gave to this interview and those sauces was impressive beyond words!
Most metal thing I have ever seen.
Wow. Knew from the start this was going to be legendary. Two masters of their of their craft finally met and the result - pure laughter and total madness… every step of the way.
My cheeks are hurting because I just smiled for 27 minutes straight. This has easily got to be one of my top 5 favorite episodes, Conan is a wild man!
new best episode unlocked
This is the best episode yet!
This wins. Hands down. I'm so glad this finally happened 😂❤
That was HANDS DOWN the best ep of Hot Ones ever.
The Greatest Talk Show Host EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YESS!!! BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS!!!!!!
One if not the best episode of Hot Ones! Conan is the goat!
The best one hands down
i love conan
Absolutely hilarious episode! Conan is the G.O.A.T!
Is this guy supposed to be funny because I don't get it. Definitely not compliant with British humour.
Call the wife!
Conan O’Brien Dies After YouTube Interview
did not expect that 21:03 hahahaha
What a legend!!
What an animal. Dude handled the sauce way better than I expected lol.
This gave me anxiety.
Best Hot Ones ever!!!!
THIS. IS. BEST. EVER. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I never thought I'd see Conan on this, but boy am I glad to see it. Team Coco forever!
🐐
Sean peaks here. Amazing. Well done. Great recognises Great 😊❤
Greatest hot ones episode by a country mile which is also in fact the distance for my restraining order from Conan.
Lol I’m genuinely shocked that Conan can handle the heat 🌶️ Especially since he said he said he only had bland food growing up. Lol
First, I love Conan. Second, I haven’t laughed this hard at a guest appearance anywhere in a while.
It just sounds like he's talking about Max Weinberg
Conan is a national treasure
Stop making this show.  After Conan it will be all down hill.  The master has elevated Hot One's to a level never to be exceeded. Sean, a great show!  You played the straight man next to Conan perfectly.
Look I’ve had some favorite episodes but, this one really takes the cake for me. No question! 😂😂
Conan never disappoints
How Conan dies…
Watched the show for a few years now... I never snorted lol'd before.  Bravo for this season finale.
Oh yeah this is one of the greatest episodes
Conan is easily the funniest human who ever lived. No one comes close.
This was the best episode since the Gordon Ramsey one 😂😂😂
I think this is the best episode yet. I have always loved Conan. Literally comedy icon. Love this episode
I don’t think that man’s a real doctor
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Proof gingers have no soul... Conan might be the toughest / craziest human alive
THIS RIGHT HERE IS THE BEST EPISODE OF HOT ONES THAT WILL EVER AIR ON ANY PLATEFORM. NO ONE CAN TOP THIS. CONAN IS A LEGENDARY COMEDIAN. THE GOAT. I don't think there will ever be any one like Conan ever again.
🙋🏼‍♀
100% full conan experience, best hot ones show I've ever seen
This goes straight to the best episode ever. Conan is insane and I love him 😂
🎉 yes! Conan is here!!!
Were the sauces and wings real?  Or were they fake?   I have a hard time believing he went through the gauntlet without feeling it.
THE GOAT IS HEREEEE 🐐💙
"I'm fine, i'm perfectly f*****g fine"  Best guest on the show since Gordon Ramsay.
I've seen almost all of these and by far Conan was my most favorite. OUTSTANDING
That was amazing.
I've seen clips but have never been interested in watching, not a single episode.. until now.  I absolutely love Conan, and in my very biased opinion, THIS IS THE BEST EPISODE EVER
22:37 Sean's face. Seeing him struggling to keep up with Conan's insanity is hilarious.
you know that producer got fired
This is an all timer. All time greatest youtube, television, Conan, you name it.
is this... comedy?
the fact that the conan o'brien episode is a thousand times more deranged than eric andre's
CLASH OF THE TITANS!!!! BEEN WAITING TO SEE THIS FOR YEARS!!!!! The 2 most entertaining living hosts in talk show history going head to head. TAKING THE DAY OFF WORK FOR THIS ONE!
The sauces spilled over during his rant he’s amazing I love you Conan
I want to start doing coke so that I can do coke with Conan O'Brian.
100 percent the best hot ones episode ever. Never thought Id see the steveO episode topped but this was magic! Huge respect to two professionals putting on an epic performance!
this was one of the best episodes ive seen in a while :D Conan what a legend
Only thing that would have made this better was the Walker Texas Ranger lever
Commenting for the algorithm
Hats off, Conan O'Brien, the best Hot Ones episode is yours!
This was some crazy good stuff!!! Haha
Insane! Conan is a legand.
People forget Conan consulted on the simpsons episode where Homer Simpson’s figured out how to eat endless hot peppers without feeling anything.
Conan is such a fantastic personality, I love this man❤
Wow, Conan absolutely killed this. Best guest ever.
My man Conan 😂🙌🏻🔥
this is the best hot ones episode . . . and it will never be topped.
An Irishman drinking all the “hot” sauces…it’s a scam. I knew it. Thanks Conan for exposing this fake show. For real though…this makes Shaq’s performance so much more embarrassing.
Conan turned into the crazy old man he's always been
16:48 thats what I call killed it that chicken 🌶 🐔 😂
I am literally watching the pre-episode ad, and can already tell this is going to be the best episode yet. I've been a big fan of Conan since I was a kid.
Good Lord!!!!!!!!! 💥
Hands down, best episode of Hot Ones! Bravo!!!
Is this the another “ Whiplash” ?
Boi so plastic he can't feel anything
the best episode evahhhhh. Conan is always ALWAYS top tier guest istfg
Conan came on with the cosmic velocity of an angry toddler hitting a bowl of spaghetti and it was poetry. Pure. Poetry.
can’t believe conan brought a fake doctor for a bit on hot ones 😂 best episode ever
Conan drinks bottle of da bomb - He is Lisan al Gaib.
39K like on 120K! views This is something special.
Cancel the show now.  Nothing will top the end.  No guest can ever compare.  It will all seem banal by comparison.
Conan being Conan, of course he's committed to being different and crazier than all of the previous and future guests. 🤣
Is Conan O'Brian that big (or is Sean that small?) or he grew 2 sizes after the ordeal??? Anyways, among the mighty 4 of Hot Ones meltdowns, you know the ones: Ramsay, B. Eilish and Shaq!
BEST EPISODE EVER (haven't even watched it yet!)
If Conan keeps these chicken bones and talks about it later 💀
This has to be one of the best episodes ever.....hall of fame material.
YAAAAAAA
Conan is the goat!
Completely insane.  Never seen anyone handle pepper sauce better.
This is by far the funniest episode of Hot Ones ever. Conan just absolutely kills me.
BEST! EPISODE! EVER!
A Legend!
My goddd that was bonkersss... Man I absolutely love when conan does press and is the one being asked questions and the centre of attention
Я люблю этого человека, и благодарен вселенной что он среди нас, живее всех живых. Спасибо Конан.
This is like a reaper eating a reaper and hearing it talk afterwards.
He is not funny at all. Very irritating
He was definitely high from all that hot sauce lol
Conan - what a f*ing legend
RIP to Conan’s b-hole.
Hands down the best episode in years lad. Conan O'Brien. What a fk'in legend 👏😂
I now understand that Doctor Arroyo was played by Jose Arroyo, a long time writer for Conan... but when he was first introduced I could only think of the small town in Mexico that I visited in the 90s for a trip when I was in high school.  I remember the town being named after and influential Doctor, and that's  José Francisco Arroyo de Anda. So, there are probably many many men and women who are and have been "Dr. Arroyo", but it was just one more magical piece of this Hot Ones that makes it such an amazing episode.  I haven't even said a thing about Conan, but that's because everyone else has already said it so eloquently.
I feel like Sean was a little worried about how far Conan was going to go with the sauce knowing he’d probably have to match it 😂💀
The one true Conan the Barbarian…
Love this show. And you got a great host.. can’t wait to be on myself in the future
Take notes, Dj. Khaled! This is how entertainment is done!
NO HUMAN CAN TOP THIS! MAYYYBE JIM CARREY BUT WOULD BE A TOUGH COMPETITION, AMAAAAAAAAZIIIIIIIMGGGGGG!!!
Conan is canonically more powerful than DJ Khalid could ever hope to be.
Conan is the BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!😂😂😂 such a great show!!!
Conan killed it!!! What a legend
Out of all the current late night talk show hosts, Fallon is the only bearable one. The others all got too political. Conan was always the one I hoped stuck around because he is genuinely hilarious, and isn't obsessed with any political agenda outwardly. I miss seeing him on late night.
The disrespect for those hot sauce i love it 🔥
Well, this episode will be legendary.  😂
Conan is unhinged and I love it.
Tooooooooo funny
I think there can be such a thing as 'too much' and I think Conan embodies that often.   This isn't entertaining for me.
hundred times better than ice spice
What an hot sauce did just happen?!! Irish people all iver the world lost their mind looking at this!!! There is only one Conan and he’s the best!!
The one time I've ever seen Sean on his back foot. Dude's put up with some crazy guests, but this is the only time I've ever seen him trying to keep up with his guest. Love Conan haha.
This is a top 3 episode of All Time!!!
BEST SHOW YET!!!
There’s no containing Conan
That was wild. I loved it😂
Finally with Connan O Brian chillie🌶🌶🐔🍗
Cut the check, Conan saved this season of Hot Ones.
This just became a legendary episode. Top 3 forever 😂
Brilliant 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾
Best episode ever.  Congrats
I don't think I have ever laughed or gagged so much at an episode of hot ones.
this was FIREE !!!
Conan is Diabolical!!!!!!!
Did he coat his tongue in wax?
COCO! 🤣
I don't know if I'm gonna ever watch a better Hot Ones than this one
No matter what, you're on Conan's show, he's not on yours.....and I'm here for it.
If Hot Ones ended tomorrow and this was the absolute last episode ever, it would be the best farewell to this series.  This was amazing.
Oh this won’t be an episode of hot ones it’ll be an episode of Homicide
This has been the most enjoyable hot ones I have seen. Amazing how Conan stuck to the mad man character. I felt he wanted to be a mad Nixon 😂
Awe-inspiring. Just incredible. This was one of the best episodes by pretty much any measure.
He reminds me of Robbin Williams 😂😂😂
This episode is something else👀 Team Coco🙌
Some real Andy Kaufmann channelling here. Respect.
Charlie Rose show with hot wings. Perfect
Epic.
THIS MAN IS A LEGEND!!!!!!!
best guest ever!
Arguably the best episode since the beginning
I think this episode is going to be most view video !
The BEST episode ever. Conan's a legend!
Nice to see Conan host Hot Ones.
Great episode guys! Much love!
"This is important for me to say" proceeds to graciously compliment Sean. Conan is the man!
A lesson on how to become Unhinged!
I feel like FWF gave Conan Ken Jong's script, and vice versa.
This was golden gold. It surpassed my expectations in every way. Yes this and Paul Rudd are the hall of famers for me!! He surpasses John Mulaney in his unflinching live free or die. “This isn’t a bit! This is life!”
😮
This Episode 😂
24:56 i don’t think he knew he was gonna be up 😂😂😂
Probably the funniest episode in a while
Easily the best episode, maybe eclipsing Gordon Ramsey hahaha
Great way to end the season. Easily one of the top 3 for me
I've never clicked faster
Did you get clearance, Sean?
This is absolutely legendary! Conan is nuts!!!
They might as well end the entire show. Go ahead and wrap it up. Noone eill ever top conans performance here.
Conan is a national treasure !!!!
Has got to be the greatest episode ever.
Only Conan would yell genuinely inspirational comedy advice with hot sauce dripping down his face and chest. 😆
Conan is an animal, hehehehe
This was one of the funniest episodes ever!
Great idea for Conan to include Jose (the doctor is one of his writers) in this
Heavens above, the man is UNHINGED. I think he's crazier than Steve-O!
YAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSS 😭
Conan gonna need a real doctor after this
The best Hot Ones yet for me! Conan kills it!! Thanks Sean!!
Yessssssssssssssssss!
This episode is a Tour de Force!  Conan is an absolute legend.
Yo this the first time I like a video so fast 😂😂😂
Conan continues to deliver and prove he is one of the best to ever do nighttime tv.
"A Charlie Rose show with hot wings" line killed me haha.
He was eating those last wings like some 🐱
Please please make this the most popular hot ones episode. I think this was much better than the Gordon Ramsay one! Conan was an absolute STAR!
Savage
Greatest episode of all time!
I do a hit of pepper x with them. Fun!
Best interview of the entire show.
Conan My favorite host.  Wow, just wow. ❤ from Taiwan
This is pure comedy gold. Thank you Conan for making my day and thank you Sean for making this happen. Keep up the good work and God bless.
Best episode ever
i AM LITERALLY CRYING, MY FACE IS FULL OF TEARS, I DON'T KNOW WHY. MAYBE I DO KNOW WHY
insane
This episode will never be touched, let alone be beaten! Conan O’Brien Reigns Supreme!
Wow Conan was a mess in the best possible way!
This is the greatest episode. Conan is DaBomb.
Conan turned into Ash from Alien !
American humour at its max level
Bruh, Conan O'Brien is the whitest guy ever and finished all the wings while Ice Spice tapped out. Bronx taking an L for this.
Conan is a national treasure. So glad he was finally on the show.
Best Finale Ever! Conan doesn’t fear danger or hot sauce 😂😂😂😂
Best episode ever!!!
My god, this did not disappoint.
Truly the KING.
THE WORST EPISODE EVER
That was insanity I. The best way possible
By far the funniest episode  ever
Well, it started well lol.... then it went completely off-the-rails
Conan is so chaotic it’s so hilarious. Sean couldn’t get anything good out of him at the end and he’s just laughing at Conan’s antics. But man how did he just drank that sauce 7 like nothing. Everytime Sean says “oh my gosh”, he knows it’s a bad idea. But he can’t stop Conan’s madness. 🤣🤣🤣
It’s going to be hard for Martin Short and Steve Martin, Conan’s comedy idols, to roast him as they always do, after watching this video.
Conan is a genius man
Impressive performance
Holy shet what an explosive season finale
now THIS is how to wrap up a season
FUNNEST. INTERVIEW. EVER.
Amazing episode!
The best Hot Ones Ever.
I can not even describe the hilarity of what I just saw! Pure gold! How Sean was able to even continue the interview without a full on fit of laughter is beyond me!
That was absolutely incredible and I'm not even sure what I just watched
Charlie Rose with hot wings --- wow, amazing insight.  Seriously, Hot Wings is the new Charlie Rose show for a new generation LOLOLOL
The pain conan must have been in, I've had da bomb and its no fun
After how many seasons and still getting new contenders for greatest episode ever.
after Da Bomb, Conan slowly became the same version of himself as when he had the espresso in Italy lol
Conan on his doctor “He’s not the best but he’s affordable” 😂😂 😂
This is the best Hot Ones episode ever made...  Please bring Conan back again in the future.
😮😮😳😳😂😂
I've seen em all and this may be the best one!
Seriously, one of the best episodes ever. Conan was so seriously funny and entertaining and has a god tongue  and an amazing sense of humor. God bless you Conan!
Conan surprised me with his heat tolerance lol. Crazy
The Greatest Guest of all time!
what’s going on i’m scared
Dr Ditch.
That sauce hitting his fingers I laughed so hard,  then he made out with his hands comic genius.
This was the best episode. Delightfully unhinged.
Need more comedians likethis on
Episode just made top 3 of all times
FINALLY someone worth watching & who I actually care about!
Literal GOAT
He put the stethoscope on his tongue and said.."Not Good" 🤣😂
Conan awesome
It's no surprise that Conan's sheer will, energy and charisma got him to power through those wings
Oh no. The part where he rubbed hot sauce all over himself was crazy.
That was off the wall bonkers amazing stuff. I was dying.
LEGEND.... wait for it...... DAIRY!!!!
Da Bomb, this is Conan.
Instantly iconic episode.
Conan is the GOAT. More talent in his flop of hair than all current TV hosts put together.
I love conan❤❤
Best. Show. Ever!
Conan is a SAVAGE. He will go to any lengths to entertain and you appreciate it even more since you're aware of how deeply cultivated he is in reality and what a gentle soul he has. Hats off to you sir. Well played.
Yes! Finally!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Edit: And he did the best and most amazing one! The GOAT!
that was insane... i loved it!
Conan is definitely on the mount rushmore of Hot Ones guest! Great episode!
The strongest Conan was here.
Conan O’Brien on Hot Ones. Great guest or THE GREATEST GUEST EVER!?!?!
MVP
He is the George Washington on the Mt Rushmore of guests when it comes to last dabbing the back half.
❤❤
I love how Conan commits 110% to everything he does.
Conan always gives 100% of him wherever he goes. He truly is a great entertainer and even better person.
Oh my god; I’ve never seen the like…
This is the best Hot Ones ever I don't think anyone will beat it 😂
Conan is insane
I honestly think Conan would die for the right bit!
this makes me want to see Letterman on Hot Ones
the best thing about that jacket is that half eaten wings in the front left pocket
this one is for the hall of fame !
i just know his lip skin is numb
The doctor was the highlight at the beginning, went completely down hill after that.  Conan used to be funny but wasn't here.  Not one part of me laughed at this garbage.
LEGEND!
I've NEVER clicked so fast!
I fcking love Conan, absolute gold!
Best Hot Ones episode so far.
Conan will be dead in less than 4 years...
OH YES PLEASE !!! CAROLINA COCO 🔥
The last funny mainstream talk show host on/off tv. Great episode, and fantastic work Dr. Arroyo.
I don’t know why but his final speech on comedy reminded me of the speech from the great dictator  😂
not even close to being funny or charming.. yeessus..!
Conan you slob 😂 glad you came on Hot Ones
Conan is the Beatles of comedy. Catch up if you think thats wrong
I've been a fan of the show for years, and I can say that this one is the best episode ever !!! ❤❤❤
this was pure insanity. have him back tomorrow
Incredible
Best best best episode 😂👏🏾
he looks like trump
.... dude.
Hands down the best Hot Ones episode I've ever seen.
Never have I ever thought I would cry for a hot ones episode
This was incredible, like watching a train wreck but the train is dancing and singing and then starts to fly
Conan handled it well but not as well as Shia LaBeouf. From now on he is my 2nd favorite. :)
Conan why did you drink the hotsauce 😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥
Conan is the GOAT guest of Hot Ones. no ones matching this
is this the biggest guest ever?      once again, I'll make the request for Penn Jillette.
That ending was real.
Unhinged 😮😮😮
This man is a legend!
I'll watch anything with Coco
Best Hot Ones of ALL TIME!!!!! 😂😂😂❤❤❤
Conan is the GOAT on Hot Ones!
Conan is the best host . Sorry Shawn
Love at the end how Conan’s face turns red to match his hair
Them bottles have to be fake hot sauce 😂 dude went way overboard with it.
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
One of the greatest episodes in Hot Ones history. Conan is one in a billion.
🤣history
Wow.  Just wow.  That was incredible.
Can we get the unedited version of this episode? I know there is so much more you took out
I think we finally found the episode that will beat Gordon Ramsay's view count
Legendary episode 🙌
Unreal
The absolute best
Conan is the best lol
Classic Conan. One of the funniest episodes ever.
Now you HAVE to convince Ric Flair to be on the show! Woooooooooooooooo!
Conan’s spice limit is milk
I genuinely look up to Conan…intelligent and with a full understanding of who he is…never takes himself to seriously 🙌
Ok THIS makes up for soooo many terrible guests. Long live the Conebone!!!
Most legendary guest fantastic "BIT" hahahahha
Wow! I've been waiting for this!!!
It's great watching his face match his hair lol
Best episode of all time.
Conan is the best sport. I love him so much :)
Yesss lads, do another one with conan even. Niceeee
Love Conan, top tier comedy here!
I'm in awe
Conan "The Greatest To Ever Do It" O'Brien
in the meanwhile kids are starving to death in gaza while conan enjoy his wing
Brilliant!!!
Absolutely revolting. Probably the best episode yet.
Conan O'Brien here to break the internet.
Perfect episode
Literally the best episode!
24:20 wow
That's what greatness looks like, a real performer.
The color of Conan’s face at the end! An absolute legend! 😂
This is everything I thought it would be. 😂😂😂
That was amazing!
Da Bomb has been renamed Da Conan. What a legend.
Conan drinks hot sauce time stamp for later: 14:00
This was perfect!
This was amazing hahahahahaha
I haven't seen fear in Sean's eyes like this since Bobby Lee crapped himself right in front of everybody.
SPOILER ALERT, this is Hot Ones highest viewed and liked episode.
He's wilder than Eric Andre  😂
Literal legend
@16:44  Conan have no fear! I love Conan! Brave man and He break the show!  Hotone will not be hot again
the best
Conan o brien worked on the Simpson. An episode had Homer eat hot chili, where one was extremely hot. He was able to eat it by covering his mouth with wax. Conan is able to eat the wings because he covered his mouth with wax like Homer, boom, case solved.
This is solid proof that gingers process pain differently!
Never in a millions years would I have guessed Conan would handle these wings and sauces  by far the best in hot ones history
One of the best guests for sure.😂
That was amazing!
Best episode of all time, should have known Conan wouldn't disappoint!
Fucken legend 😂😂😂😂
Goat episode as expected
Pure respect and admiration for Conan. Couldn't have picked a better season closer.
Spice lord
Not gonna like... I stood up and cringed when he did Dabomb shenanigans... Yikes! Great show! I enjoyed, and the respect each other had! Bravo!
Great episode only disappointed no question about Jordan
If you don't agree this is the best Hot Ones episode ever, you're absolutely wrong.
Conan NEVER disappoints 😂😂😂
This... this is what we've been waiting for.
Que looooco jajajajaja, el mejor invitado para el mejor show hasta la fecha jajajajajajajaaja, RESPECT!!! XD
Not gonna lie, he had me in the first half... Hahaha
Greatest episode ever
Conan was everything I wanted him to be and MORE! It was worth the wait x10000000 ❤
What a legend
Conan hit those wings and sauce like a barbarian. I almost died laughing!
Why Conan doctor is his writer Jose Arroyo? He cant afford real doctor Andy Richter ?
I am microwaving as we grok
'...its just big me'  conan o'brien 🐐
Sean lost control of the interview halfway through and it had me rolling
Hot Ones GOAT.
Like they say: leave the Best for last.   He is by far my favorite, comedian, host  and hot ones' guest.
I've wanted this for so long,the amount of times I will watch this and laugh can't be overstated.
Genuinely a harder guy than Dj Khalid 😂
Yeah this is the best episode
I love how conan is completely different when he is being interviewed
What a nut !!! 😂😂😂😂
Conan reminded me of that "Yoink" dude just instead of wild animals it's hot sauce.
That was one of the most amazing chaos-energy presentations ever. Excited for next season!
This was simply amazing
That made me laugh hard. Thank you Conan and Hot Ones.
When he compliments Sean for this show and his great interview questions 🤩 also Conan is the funniest human being alive. He can make anything hilarious! Always makes me slap my knee 😂
did this dude just put chicken wings in his pocket
Best show yet! I was crying laughing!
Like there is no better one for the hot wings than Conan O'Brian
best one yet.......Go big or go home.
Sean at 22.53 looks like he's trying to figure out how he'll live with being the man responsible for killing Conan O'Brien xD
As always, Conan didn’t let us down. Best episode ever. GOAT!
❤
The great, overrated and over the top mr Conan O'Brien. I used to enjoy watching this guy.
He already answered the second question without us realizing by putting the bones that he finished inside his pocket
Hilarious 😂😂😂 absolutely hilarious, a comedy genius.  I'm laughing my head off.  Respect Conan😂😂😂👍Thank you
One of the best episodes yet!!!!
This the funniest episode ever, very unexpected! Props to Conan!!
He did the Homer Simpson wax bit. Conan is a fraud!
Can you check for my pulse?   “Yeah it’s there” 🤣🤣🤣
Conan is a national treasure
I'm sorry to all the previous hot ones guests but Conan is legit the funniest guest they've ever had so far, i've never laugh so hard while watching this show before
This is the greatest episode ever.   Christian Marron
Props to Conan! Holy smacking those wings out of the park!
I'm ready for other Hot Ones guests reactions to Conan's Da Bomb experience
Greatest episode of Hot Ones ever !!!!!!!
In Sean's word: INCREDIBLE
Conan on beast mood
This one’s going down in the books!! Hall of fame episode for sure
This man is a savage😂
one of over the top guest so far, I love connan
CCCOOOOOOOONNNNNNNAAAAAAANNNNNNNNN!!  Ladies and gentlemen, stay seated and hold your phones tight; today’s guest is the legend Conan “Good Times” O’Brien!!
This was the most entertaining hot ones episode.
Eric Andre is watching this and saying "Dayum.....that guy is crazy!"
i've never clicked on anything faster.
What a legend, Conan is one of the greats!
HOLY SHIIII
This is the best Hot Ones ever!!!
Incredible. Standing ovation for the new king of Hot Ones 😂👏🏻
Conan Dabomb-barian
This. Is. Magic. 🎉😂😂😂🎉
Jesus Christ Conan is a machine lol
Conan still not saying Leno’s name forever warms my vitriolic heart.
Conan: "Can you check the pulse for me?" Dr. Arroyo: "It's there"   Don't think I've laughed that hard in my life
When he came on claiming he didn’t have much experience with spice and had no comfort level around it I wasn’t expecting much. Needless to say Conan blew my socks off, I am very impressed. He handled that hot sauce like a CHAMPION
GOAT fkn GOAT
Conan steal the show for good! 😂
Funniest episode ever. Not really a big Conan fan. This interview was solid. Comedy gold. Great interview.
Conan is so funny
Funniest man on the planet. Thank you for this.
I don’t think I’ve laughed so hard at these interviews I love Conan O’Brien
I'm sitting at my desk working from home and I am a mess. In tears dying laughing.  That is the greatest Hot Ones I've ever watched.  Ice spice is but a distant memory!!
PURE, SOLID, GOLD.
Conan was one of my favs
Conan is literally one of the best to ever do it, not just a talk show, not just this show, I mean LIFE! What a legend!
Well, this episode was Da Bomb!!!
Conan is the definition of a monster 😮
My goodness, the man is a legend and we're all experiencing greatness in real time, but that was next level commitment and perfection!
Conan is the 🐐 of late night
This has to be the greatest episode in the history of hot ones….. Conan is even more goated
conan is the best guest you guys ever had.
Conan tried to break Sean, but Sean refused to be broken.
Conan outdoin’ Steve-O 😂
"You just feel for the pulse." ... "It's there." "Thank you. He's very good; very expensive."
Red heads have an unfair pain tolerance advantage 🤣
This quickly, easily, and by a wide margin became the greatest Hot Ones Episode of all time. I peed myself while eating my lunch and I didn’t even care. People asked me afterwards if I knew that I peed myself and I said “YEAH, SO?!?!?”
If I have doctor Arroyo as my medical physician, I feel like I would never get sick ever again. Coz laugher is the best medicine.
Greatest episode ever
Yeah this guy is crazyyyyyyyyy😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Conan is my favorite reptilian. 😉
Conan is fire!!!
Try to recruit Taylor Tomlinson next season. Her coping with eating the wings would be entertaining
Best Hot Ones episode and it's not even close!  Conan is a national treasure!
I knew Conan would be the best guest this show ever had and i was RIGHT
Conan is the GOAT
Best hot ones show everrrr
It’s interesting how you asks someone about a time back then and they always say 1993 .  Maybe it just me but that’s the year is was born
Watched it twice because it was so good
Hilarious-  persuasive, I don’t watch TV any more but I’m going to find a way to watch Conan’s show on MAX
Wow
“You’re not a doctor, are you?” “I should be.” Words to live by
Conan O'Brien is like the father that I never had. I mean, I had a father but I like to just consider Conan was the better father.
I gotta admit Conan is a wonderful personality
I vote this to be the best episode ever!
Yeah I love Hot Ones... and there have been some amazing episodes. This is my favorite of all time. Well done Sean and Conan.
Ok but for real, where can we find Sean's jacket?
Incredible
Conan is my God
Respect to Conan 😂
Proof that the wings can, and will most likely, get you high. Great episode.
Next: Jordan, Sona and Matt.
That is the most insane thing I've even seen. Conan is a legend!!
I don't think this episode can be topped.
Yesssss! Finally!
I don't even have word for what I just witnessed.
You can really tell when the endorphins start kicking in for him at the end
Best episode ever.
Weird music choice near "da bomb". Hard to enjoy Conan's humor with it.
best episode
Best episode in years. Conan giving it all in the name of comedy demands respect. Crushed the wings and crushed the entertainment
This was iconic
Did Mila help getting Conan on the show?
Half an hour of Conan proving he’s be best there is
find the pulse, "YEAH ITS THERE"  dead. laughing.
Conan's blink-and-you-miss-it impression of Andy was sublime.
ConanNNNNNNNNNN! I’m so happy this finally happened!
BEST GUEST EVER!!!!!!!! PERIOD!!!!
Gold
"No, yeah, no, yeah" (the good ol' Midwest conversion filler
I am SCREAMING LOLOL god I love this man
I didn't know I wanted this but it makes so much sense!
The best ever 🤣🤣
I want to watch this again right after his talk he gave at Harvard. The juxtaposition is astounding.
Best episode ever, loved it 😂
IS this guy even more crazy than stev o? :D wow, what a ride.
Ok, that was fuckng impressive.
sam kenisson, hunter s thompson, robin williams, andy kaufman, charles mingus would've made outrageous guests. RIP.
The music added on this is so unnecessary, really really horrible
I'm dyin over here...  bent over laughing hysterically. had to stand up from my desk walk away and breath....    the GOAT!!! my goodness he just never turns off...  I'm just in awe... hahahah
Conan is a mad man! Best one yet 😂😂😂
I can't be the only screaming NOOOOOO CONAN 😂😂😂 This is an epic episode
THIS IS THE BEST EPISODE OF HOT ONES IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY!!!!!!!!!\
Conan is the best! no doubt!
Best episode ever! Thanks Conan!
Legend
Well this is the best one.  Conan is insane, but I love him!
A force of nature! So much funnier when not handcuffed by a network TV format
Best hot ones episode
i havent laughed this hard in awhile !!!!!!!
We all know conan will die from himteying to do a simple skit and some weird unexpected hits him like a getting stabbed by a swordfish in the desert
Conan is the new number 1 for this show.
This episode is intense!
Dude just pocketed a wing. That is irish i'm sure
The best episode ever. Conan is literally the GOAT.
I haven't cried this much in years!!! Lol!!! Conan is ICONIC!!!!
CONAN IS A LEGEND!!
Maybe it's because this sort of comedy doesn't necessarily translate well to a British sense of humour but I just spent the whole video utterly bewildered at how it went. He lost me by the end of the second wing and then he just became more and more odd. It wasn't funny at all, seemed more like a cry for help than anything.
This is the most unhinged Hot Ones ever Did not see that coming at all😂
I wouldn't have imagined picking Conan as the most unhinged and insane guest yet on Hot Ones but here we are.
I give him 4 years tops.
Conan is THE best! Loved this episode. The best, best episode!  He’s just something else man. ❤
Wow that was impressive 😅
Best episode ever!!!
iconic
Awesome! Love Conan!!!
I could have sworn they said Shakira was closing out this season. That said, Conan is great and glad he is on the show. It he an amazing comedian.
Conan is the first guest who surprised Sean with dab
It's everything I wanted and more.
CONAN IS WILD
One of the best guests so far!
Instant GOAT. My man out here just free basing sauces. Legend.
This was good one
Compare this episode to ice spice
💀
In all my years, I never EVER expected anyone to out-Eric Andre, Eric Andre. Jesus, Conan is a legend.
Absolute best hot ones episode hands down! It was so fun to watch!
This was the best one yet!
Yes!!!! Now i can die a happy. LOL Finally Conan on Hot Ones.
An instant classic! WTG Co-Nan!
Best ep ever
I have never been so simultaneously entertained and disgusted by one of these before 😂 shout out to Conan for bringing his special brand of chaos to this show, been waiting a long time for this one and he did not disappoint!
Conan 2024
TEAM COCO
This man is pure chaos personified. 😂
This was repulsive!
Best episode yet.
BEST EPISODE EVER.
Conan is a mad man!😂
The best gonna be the best!
Best one EVER!!! Conan is the best.
Never thought I'd see the day when coco would be on! He's the best guest on any show he's on!
Da Bomb slowly dribbling out onto the table as Conan gives his unhinged impassion speech is an absolute work of art.
“These aren’t the rantings of someone who’s had some bad chemicals!” 😂😂😂 EPIC! WHAT WILL TOP THIS??? CONAN IS THE WING KING! 🍗👑 CROWN HIM WING OVERLORD HEADMASTER CHAMPION! 🏆🎖️🤴🏼🥇🏵️
Best guest ever
Dude I screamed at my phone... Conan No! 😂
Awesome
I definitley didn't think Conan would be aggressively slamming the wings like a maniac
Jordan Schlansky should have helped to prepare the wings in various ways
Get Gruden on here!
Conan owned the show. His craziness matches the show. Shaun can sit back and enjoy … Perfect.. WOW….
Conan saved this season for me
Instant classic episode
Best episode ever? I think yes.
Conan, after his last fire wing looked like a toddler that was given control of their own ice cream cone 😂
next season...uhmmmm...ryan reynolds? Please..Go get him..
Brett Baker where you at?
Love Conan!
All I can say is …EPIC😂😂😂❤
Well...I guess I kind of have to check his show out now.
"THIS IS NOT A BIT! THIS IS LIFE!" Conan's face's just as red as his hair 😂😂😂 this was superb, I haven't laugh this loud in a while.
This is possibly the greatest interview ever.
The most depressing thing about this episode is i’ll never be able to watch it again for the first time. Master Class from both of them.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?  WHY CAN'T I FEEL?
Literally the best episode!
I'm dying 😂😂😂 I love the outro with Conan fully disheveled. So great.
Conan is great every time
CONAN!!!! I love you sir!
Best one yet
This episode should be Top 1 in everyone list
The incredible difference between this and Ice Spice.
Is it just me or is his face getting progressively into the shades of red?
Conan straight up took Da Bomb from the bottle.  A B S O L U T E  L E G E N D
This is the best episode in a long time. I got some good lol's.
So this just confirms that Conan is a wonderful person. As we all suspected.
What an Epic episode My Favorite Guest yet ! wow. !!  love Conan's shameless approach
Easily the best episode of Hot Ones. Conan is an absolute legend
Conan is the most committed person to the comedy 😅😂
Best ever episode. I'm dying. Please more. We need more!
😲😲😲😲😲😲 watching him do da bomb beyond insanity
Best episode ever! 🤣
Hat's off to Conan for the way he built that up, ending with that super spicy crescendo! Probably the first time having uncontrollable laughter during a Hot One's episode.
Please have a comedian bring in a stunt double for an episode it would be hilarious
The best episode, period
About time I've been waiting for this I bet Conan is going to  lose his mind. Still waiting on seeing cm punk or kid rock
Top 3 episodes ever without question
craziest episode ever.
I'm impressed with Conan's ability to talk thru this.....
I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready. Conan is the GOAT.
Didn’t realise how funny he actually is. The best one yet.
I knew it would be, but this is the best episode ever.
Hahahaha, I've never laughed so loud and long. This was my favorite episode thank you, and look forward to watching Conan April 18th.
I love Conan, but I can't watch people with food on their faces. I couldn't look at half this interview. Haha
Gotta say one of my favorite episodes if not my favorite also Very rare no question asked after hot sauce number 9
conan is amazing
It's Conan. Idk why tf I expected this to be a normal episode
I love Conan
How was this the only episode where Sean doesn't say "careful around the eyes". Conan washed his hands with the sauce! Legendary 🏆
All I can think is "how much money must you have in order to blithely mess up your nice jacket with chicken wings"?
THE GOAT
Conan did such a great jon
This man stuffing wings in his jacket brought me to tears. Pure comedy gold. lol.
You know I was starting to wonder whether Conan was actually getting any sauce, until I saw him fcking drooling uncontrollably as the end and that convinced me.
Conan is the greatest showman on TV. Brought a funny doctor on set to liven it up and puts the wings in his jacket pocket because he can. Best season ending interview ever.
Conan "The Legend" great Episode
Okay he killed it 😂
The variant of the MC1R gene is alive and well in Conan , what a beast !
Absolutely my favorite hot ones episode 😂 so funny, Conan did great 😂
Hay... Remember when Conan WON HOT ONES, then passed out and died!?  Legend
🤣🤣🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
Ice Spice was the worst, Conan is the best.
#1 episode ever.
Oh... My... God!!!
Killed the gaunlet, had Sean on his heels, making him forget to ask question 9.  The barrage of humor and sincereity.  No one will ever top this.  Ever.
They have to retire Da Bomb after this.
What an incredible display of hot sauce eating by Conan. This is a Mount Rushmore episode. He honestly held his composure so well for how much sauce he was ingesting.
This is the greatest Hot One.   Christian Marron
sean must have  had ptsd in this show with vietnam flashbacks from Coolio's episode
DID NOT DISAPPOINT!😅😅😂😂
Conan is the absolute late night king!
YES!!! I didn't expect this but Conan is easily my favorite host.
For the love of god get Tim Robinson already!
2 legends, 10 wings, 1 insane finale. Gotta watch conan's show, we owe it to him for that performance.
Dr. Spaceman
Insane, amazing, hilarious 👏🤯
Conan the Barbarian !  He just crushed the enemy, drove them away and heard the lamentations of DaBomb.
When you order Conan , YOU GET CONAN ! Wow, Pure Chaos in the end
Oh Lordy, I laughed so hard!
Hope Dr. Arroyo prescribes some vanilla ice cream.
conan, your eyes are bloodshot ddog
Instant classic. Conan is a mad man.
conan bringin out his inner Chris Farley.
My life is now complete.
The greatest hot ones' performance of ALL TIME!! Conan is a living legend... wow!
Conan's trip to Haiti was really impressive. There's comedy, but you see it makes genuine connections with the Haitian people. I look forward to his new show.
no shot you got Conan! :O
Sean: *stares concerningly* Conan: "IM FINE IM PERFECTLY FINE"*tears flowing sauce spewing out his mouth and eyes bloodshot red*
This is literally the best episode of ALL TIME!! No other will be able to top this!!
This, this is the PEAK
This is the one episode that I can't stop watching!!!!!
I love Conan O'Brien. He is the GOAT. I have tears streaming down my face.
FINALLY. When I see Conan O'Brien, I click. It's that simple.
Good god I love that man
I did not expect this. What a show! :D
Conan is amazing bro. Good job Sean and hot ones
60 year old Conan putting on a better show than any other guest.
Why he's  the best.
Alright, he convinced me. I'll buy a MAX subscription and watch his show 😂
"what's wrong with me? why can't i feel?" - funniest episode ever - go team coco
And this is why he's the best to ever do it
It gets so unhinged that you almost forget that he was pocketing the wing bones. Brilliant.
Sean was literally scared of him 😅
Legendary
Conan is such a delight to see on screen. His crazy energy is so fun!
the most amazing performance so far.... dont think this will ever be topped. Conan is an amazing specimen of a human being.
Hilarious! I am not a fan of C O'B, but am a fan of First We Feast and this one was great! :)
4:45 TORILLE!
Holy Jesus did he just drink the last dab ...definitely a pro Conan move.....
Legend
A legend.... what else to say. Let's see someone top that.
I’ve always loved Conan. He’s committed to comedy, and never gave into the political BS to get an easy laugh. This was one of my favorite Hot Ones episodes. Thanks Sean and Conan!
staged
"WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME? WHY CAN'T I FEEL?!"
Hah... Conan is WIGGIN' OUT, MAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
Funniest man alive right here
survival out of pure adrenaline! I mean, looked to me even tougher than David Blaine, that's incredible!!
Conan is really the GOAT
27:21 Conan's still bringin' it! Now that this season of shows is over, do you think that we could see a few episodes before next season starts, of compilations of the moments from selected past shows that had to "be left on the cutting room floor" by the editor for whatever, and which never made it into the final aired version when the shows premiered?
Watching him hurt MY stomach....Conan is a legend.
"I'm starting to feel some sensations!"
This man has and will always be my comedy hero. He commits to everything 110% and have a bit already constructed with the fake doctor just shows how he is always ready and always hilarious. Best episode I’ve seen of this show. Absolutely legendary.
This was the best Hot Ones . Conan is gold .  So funny
Conan putting chicken wings in his $5000 jacket like a homeless man is a man living as many lives as he can.
This is classic Conan, 100% commitment to the bit no matter what and yet giving thoughtful and honest answers while acknowledging Sean's skills and treating him like a peer. I am also genuinely concerned for his lower digestive tract. Art is suffering. Hope Sean goes on the podcast!
best episode ever!
This episode MUST be the funniest episode for Sean Evans to do. Conan is such a treat.
Lol
Hot wing Charlie rose 😂
Usually the premise of the show catches the guests a little off guide and you can see behind the curtain. I feel like that was not at all the case here. Conan did not drop his character for a single split second.
Lol he got so angry he kind of turned into Lewis Black in the end
Conan wins!  It's over.
I'm like crying laughing 😂😅😂😂😂
Funniest fkn show ever
That was the greatest episode Hot Ones has ever done. Thank you Conan.
“Where?”
Conan could’ve just put on the best episode
The best!
I was so scared the whole time
not a fan of Conan just not being able to not be "Conan".
😂😂😂 I love him!!
This was easily one of if not the best episode ever. I’ve always admired Conan’s special brand of humor, but his commitment here was off the charts
Of course Conan has to turn the entire interview into a bit. Sona must be shaking her head during this.
This is the greatest Hot Ones performance I have ever seen. Bit or no bit, those wings are HOT and Conan is a savage for this.
Pure unhinged comedy
TOPPED it all.  All guests.  Phenomenal. Serious at times and yet foolish to sell his style. Keep at it Conan.
I loved this! 😂
Conan... an absolute legend!
What a monster
That episode has already become history. Incredible 😆
conan really went full beastmode. absolute madman
Jesus Christ, Conan 😃
I know thats probably what he wanted and I'm somewhat hesitant to give it to him, but man he's earned it: this directly went to one of the top 3 episodes
I think we all got more than was bargained for here. Conan is legendary
Conan need to out perform is what makes him such a great entertainer
Se juntaron dos potencias Mundiales, dos genios.
I am in complete tears at this episode!  This was unbelievably fantastic what a whirlwind interview ❤❤❤😂😂😂
Now, that's a perfect way to do that 😉
This didn't go well, did it?
This is the best one. Not even close.
Perfect mix of chaos and thoughtful answers. Conan's da best.
By far my favorite. I laughed so hard.
The best episode I've ever seen.
Best episode ever!  I particularly loved the bottle of Da Bomb tipped over and dribbling pathetically as Conan ranted on and on.  Chefs kiss!  😂
I hope your show goes on for many more years. But if this happened to be the last one, it is already legend.
His red hair is going light up on fire 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Unbelievable commitment by the GOAT. I can't imagine the mess his insides became after all of that!
This was thee most unhinged Hot Ones I have ever watched.  Conan is legendary.
Couldn't ask for a better season finale than this!!! I love Conan so much.
Conan showed up!
This was epic, Conan's crazy
"What's wrong with me? Why can't I *FEEL* ?!" 😂❤ God bless you Conan!
THE BEST HOT ONES OF ALL TIME!!!
I have never been more in awe of a person but equally as terrified by them than Conan O Brien in this episode 😅😂
Definitely the best episode yet! Go Team Coco!
From Max Weinberg to HBO Max.
Wow.. salute to legend
I could never stand this guy, I tried to watch and gave up 5 mins in. But I’m glad so many people enjoyed the episode.
Great interview! Best one yet!
I think Conan just established himself as the hottest one! 😂😂😂😂
Gosh I really hope Conan got his stomach purged after this. Can't be good for the digestive tract
Ive watched this show since season 1... and this is by far my favorite episode.
Best episode yet
Anime Fight between Conan and a Water Buffalo was not what I was expecting, but I'm here for it!
I didn't think it would get better when he drank the hot sauce, then I didn't think it would get better when he added more the bomb ... it kept getting better lol
Seeing this makes me wish Robin Williams was still alive to be on this show.
this is so awesome but you should have captions on your channel, not just auto generated <3
Wow he definitely outdid Shia LaBeouf with his drinking of the hot sauces from the bottle. Putting all over his face hands and body. Remember DJ Khalid couldn't go halfway with the least hot spices ever on this show!!
Finally!!!
Watching Sean graciously mimic whatever insanity Conan was doing, was amazing. His excitement for "the bit" and the realization that he had to match, all at the same time; brilliant.
One of the best Episodes! Goat performance
THE! BEST! GUEST! EVEEERRRRRRRRR!!!!!! FINALLY!!!!!!! Someone who doesn't pussyfoot around These Wings . This man devoured it and boldly took it on
CONAN MAKES ICE SPICE LOOK LIKE A LIFELESS ROCK😅
Sean’s fearful look of genuine concern is the punchline. 😂😅
Absolute legend!
My apologies to the show. Because you can never ever top this guest. You have officially peaked.
I feel like there should be a show dedicated just to talking about this episode
Abolutley the best hot ones!
Best hot ones ever.
Best episode ever!
Conan took those wings with a iron fist!!! Lol 💯💯👍👍💪💪🤣🤣🤣🤣 Respect Conan!!! 👍
“Dr.Arroyo” is the Emmy-winning José Arroyo. He’s a funny writer and cartoonist.
This was impressive 😂😂😂
Wow Conan.... Woww... Respect! Great Finale!!!
This has to be one of my fav episodes of HOT ONES by far! Conan ate these wings like a madman
Conan just broke the show
Dude is so effing funny. "I never saw spice"
That will be a Hot Ones Classic until the end of time.  What an absolute nut!  Loved it!!
CONAN HOF.   Christian Marron
Conan friggen kills me- why is he keeping the bones?! LOL
Conan giving a huge speech about the fact that comedy is eternal in our history and that we should seek all great comedy to be forever enjoyed after taking the heavyweight champion hotsauces to the face. Really is amazing
Massive respect for a massive legend. Not only did he crush the wings and drink the sauce, he brought his "doctor" and put a his own comedic twist to the episode and gave it his all. An entertainer through and through
Watched this with my 5 year old daughter, I was yelling at Conan to stop with the sauce. She was cracking up. Thank you! Conan is the GOAT!!!!
God, he’s the greatest to ever do it
Me after the first couple of wings: Man, Conan is crushing it! Me after Da Bomb: Ah, here we go… 😂
Think we found the GOAT
This was the best ive seen for a long while🎉
There are people I desperately wanted to see on the Hot Ones. Then there are people who I wouldn't even dare to think would ever make an appearance there. You know people like Conan O'brien, Dave Grohl, Jesus Christ, David Attenborough and that's about it.
<333
That was crazy 🤣
👏👏🤣🤣
When I noticed Conan was in the show I stopped everything I was doing!
Those hot sauces bowed down to Conan the O'Brien.
One of the best episodes
I'm a huge Conan fan, but this is just disgusting :D
Super high justified praise to sean on his interviewing loved that you are one of the best sean
Conan has to be the best interview ever . The females you had in lately scked
I was thinking Conan had some miracle berries before the show.... Nah
I've never had to look away from an episode before, but man oh man his face at the end made me nauseous
I'm so excited. I could not click fast enough.
Conan is built different 😂
I think you have to end the series after this one. Where can you go from here?
I think this episode actually shaved off 3 years of Conan's life with how he committed to the bit of drinking pure spice
Best episode to date.
I'm calling it now.... No one will EVER top this.
Ok, how much did you pay him so people will stop wimping out and come on?
Conan is a psychofucking love it❤
I think we've got the most UNHINGED episode of Hot Ones now
Conan's gonna Conan and the world is better for it
Amazing, simply amazing. Please bring Conan back next season.
This will go down in history XD
FINALLY
The first handful of seasons of The Simpsons were the best, partly due to this guy's style of thinking and energy.
To have a living legend a pure entertaining talent like conan for the season end makes up for having that POS of a disappointment ice spice
Best episode to date
That was an all-timer. 😂 👏🏻
. . .
Fill an Irish guy full of alcohol? No effect. Fill him full of spices? CRAZY THINGS HAPPEN!
For those who are unaware: Dr Arroyo was played by José Arroyo, who’s been a writer for Conan since 2002. It’s amazing how Conan can keep his people around for ages. Some have been with him since the start.
I'm not sure this will ever be topped. I've always wanted Conan as a guest, but this episode is far above and beyond anything I expected. Conan may have changed the Hot Ones game forever. I'm not sure we can just keep going after this one. 😅  Incredible. 👏👏👏
Do you hear that?   It's the sound of leftists typing furiously after hearing Conan's closing speech about finding humor in everything.
and then conan died 23 minutes later..                                  lol jk
Conan is an absolute Legend !
For some reason this is 100% what I expected to see lol.. he went full conan and my god it was sensational
I love how Sean looks at Conan with concern but also a sense of bewilderment and amazement at the "end of the gauntlet" part. :') And honestly Conan is the only guy who can be outrageously loud and "present" but he still makes it work and it never fails to put a smile on my face, no matter what kind of mood i'm in. This was one of those legendary episodes, for sure. ❤
Wow.🤣😂
Conan just won Hot Ones, it's just the best one
he destroyed those wings what a legend
Conan is the GOAT of late to all my GenXers. Hands down the BEST guest you've had to date!
This was ICONIC
EASILY. THE. MOST. EPIC. INTERVIEW. EVER!!!!!!!!
We need post interview from Conan on side effects later that day.
And this is the day, when I started to like Conan hahahaha, he is hilarious
Wow what a legend! He did so many firsts on this show. Brave soul. Hope is doing better after last dabbing DaBomb.
One thing's for sure, you can never guess what Conan will do in ANY situation. It's what made him a great showman! Love him to bits!
Conan giving us a master class in what a professional of show business and comedy does.
RIP Conan
I watch this show since season 2. This is definitely top 5 material.
I can't stop laughing, best guest ever!!!
I am so worried for coked up Conan
Did he take something 😉before the show
Nobody mentioning the fact that he kept putting chicken wings in jacket pocket? No? Alright.
ICONIC
Conan straight thugged out these wings.
Instant Classic!!!!
Did Conan take a trip to the ER afterwards?  That was insane!
The BEST episode ever!!!!
That was chaotic... Loved it
No episode will ever compare to this. I'm keeled over.
Someone should go check on this man!
Best episode ever!
funiest one EVER!!!
Wow. hats off to you Conando, the sauce barbarian
That was awesome
Did Conan have to go to the hospital after this?! LOL!  Absolute brilliant insanity!
What a titan
I feel like everyone says “Sean is a great interviewer” then Conan said “let’s find out how good he is!” And was just absolutely wild! Mad respect to both these great hosts!
COMEDIC BEAST AT HIS BEST. Conan ALWAYS brings the funny..even putting himself in danger and/or discomfort. Complete maniac!!😂😂😂
That's pretty dam impressive 👏.  CONNAN is the man . 😝
Man, this is one of the best ones you have ever done- I love Conan- I knew this was going to be awesome! Conan is a LEGEND!
best episode ever !
this and the first gordon ramsey are definetly my top 2 episodes just legendary performances haha
Best. Episode. Ever.
This must be the one episode of the series where Sean totally gives up on his “mirror the guest” philosophy! (At least, if he was doing the same things with the last four sauces, the cameraman and editor didn’t include it.)
CONAN IS THE GOAT
This is the best episode of Hot Ones, period.
When did he knock over the bottles? There was a cut and suddenly they were tipped over
Man I'm crying here 😅😅😅😂😂😂 best episode ever Conan killed it
Honestly the first episode I didn't do skips at all. Love Conan! Cant wait for his show Thank you for this, hot ones!
We need more Conan.  He’s not political and he can make anything funny.  Wish he was doing more that we could enjoy.
WOW his taller 193 cm
True comedy is full-commitment to the joke....and Conan has got to be the most INSANE guest on Hot Ones ..EVER!!!!
Best episode yet!
This is one of the most legendary episodes I've ever seen. What a talent. I'm in awe.
26:07 WOW I DID NOT REALISE HOW TALL CONAN IS.
*Conan telling the story of getting on and immediately thrown off of a water buffallo because that's entertainment* (this is foreshadowing)
Thanks, Conan
FROM THE EARLIEST SEASONS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR CONAN. THE DAY HAS COME 🔥
Finally a guest that stood against the hot ones lineup 🤣
One of the best episodes ever. You got to love Conan.
I never thought that the GOAT of hot ones would be THE Conan O'Brien! I am beyond impressed with his commitment to his craft and he will never be seen as anything other than a real one! BUSSIN BUSSIN RESPECTFULLY
This was so insane and I loved every moment of it
Conan is the Bomb beyond insanity champ hands down!! Lol 😂😂😂😂
Conan came saw and conquered.
Literally one of the best episodes generally surprised with how well he took the wings considering how overboard he went 😂😂
😂 love it
Already know this will be one of the best guests in the history of the show
Bro Sean, your show has peaked today.
What an absolute madlad!
This was a masterpiece
this episode can't be topped
Conan is a PRO! Of course it's going to be an amazing episode.
far and away, my most favorite comedian. the sheer intelligence, wit, insight, humor, kindness, and wonder he exudes is admirable. best hot ones vid ever I’ve waited so long for this
Its official! Move over Paul Rudd, Conan is the GOAT!…. Last DAB?? Try the last spash, extra sloppy!👏👏👏👏BRAVO sir!
easily the funniest and most nauseating episode to date.
conan is such a talent
I literally screamed watching this - Conan is the man! Top interview 🙌🏼
This is my new all time favourite interview. Conan is the GOAT!!!! Multiple bits the unhinged energy. I want Sona and Matt to try some of the sauces 😂
YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS
Finally someone I know
What a legend!! There is no way of topping this. I am at work choking, I can’t stop laughing 😂😂😂 Conan i freaking love you ❤❤

Conan is absolutely unhinged! hahahah
Conan!!
Easily a top 10 guest of all time.
Conan giving major Lewis Black vibes at the end😂 of
Best. Episode. Ever!
LOL! When he took a swig of the pepper x sauce and you can hear everyone behind the camera make a noise like they just saw a 5 year old holding a puppy get pancaked by a bus.
Brilliant!
The one time Sean didn't match bite for bite and pour for pour.
I am so here for Conan's comeback. What a legend.
why are they still so far away from each other even tho covid ended

Amazing 😂🤣
I want to be there when he takes the jacket to dry cleaner and explains he had a lot of chicken bones in the pockets
I love Conan so much
This is an instant classic!
The most unhinged hot ones yet.
Even when he says "no laughs there";and is super nice, he still gets a chuckle and a smile...
I’d love it Sean Evan’s if you could get Jason Mamoa on your show, he’d be amazing!
I’ve never laughed so hard at a hot ones. So create. Top 3 all time
Conan O Brien. The best hot one i have seen in a long time. What a amazing moment. He really put it all out there. ❤❤❤😂😂😂
Conan’s a legend 😂
SALUTE CONAN🫡 REAL CHAMPION 4 MAKIN DA BOMB HIS BITSH😅
Amazing just wow I love Conan
Conan didn't disappoint. Laughed nonstop the last 5 minutes 😅
Conans  hilarious and this is funny. But hes a little annoying here😂
Absolutely the best guest ever!!!! Fn dying rn laughing so hard😂
*"Call the wife!!"* 😅
Conan and Bill Burr should do a combo episode
Leno is still “the other guy” 😂
Conan O'Brien  is the definitely the best guest that you have had, it was amazing, he is the MAN
Well that was incredible hahaha
Best episode in a LOOOOOOONG time XD
The GOAT
Conan is the fucken man always has been always will be.
Wow, this is a good episode!  Way better and funnier than expected.  Awesome.
I love that people with shows on HBO max keep making fun of the name change to just MAX
This is the GOAT episode!
What a beautiful trainwreck
This might be the funniest episode of Hot Ones ever.
conan bringing jose as his doctor was a happy surprise
He's gonna pay...tomorrow.  Brilliant!
Best one ever!!!!
Ew.
Wow, just wow 😅😂
Sean is indeed one of the best interviewers of our time as Conan, the best talk show host of our time, put a seal on it BIGTIME!
Been incredibly depressed all week and this was the first thing that’s made me laugh. Thanks Sean and Conan.
Big One !!!
He is our Michael Scott
Hottest Sauce there was Conan for sure.
The hotter the wings get, the more hyperactive Conan gets.
"Out of state" medical school, very affordable
Hilarious! Best Hot Ones EVER!!! 😂 😂😂
Probably the best episode of Hot Ones ever.
It would of been money if he made Jordan Schlansky eat the wings while Conan riffed
Conan is, was, and forever will be the GOAT.
Haven’t even watched this but this guest has been in my top 3 most wanted on the show love conan
Conan is the kind of guy who could sell ice in finland, lol
Best episode there will ever be
GOAT episode.
Only Conan can come in and effortlessly be the best Hot Ones guest of all time.
First time Sean didn’t match the guest’s intake.
I've been watching Hot Ones since it's debut, this is the best episode.  I've never had to pause the show because I'm laughing too hard to hear what's going on before, this was phenomenal
gonna look up warren g harding now
This was the best
YES!  Conan is the best!
one of the best hot ones in years!
Wow!
Conan is a legend. Taking on the wings of death!!!! Making it look easy while he take shots of the bottles like if it was water. You set the stage and I see no one out doing it it like you. Thank you for being part of my childhood to adulthood 🎉
Finally we got the proof that we were all waiting for: Conan is a cyborg!
The best episode yet! Just epic :D
😂
“What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I feel?”, the voice of my generation.
Redheads have a higher pain tolerance 😂
OK, it's official, BEST season finale guest EVER!
I can't breathe 😂😂😂😂
TEAM COCO!!!
I cannot wait to hear about this experience on the podcast, lol.
I don’t think I’ve seen Sean laugh harder during an episode! This was pure chaos and I love it
Cops better look out. If they ever had to take down Conan, he’d be immune to OC spray.
Did we just witness an episode that will go down in hot ones history!?  OUTSTANDING
conan was a beast
Conan started sounding like Lil Jon by the end. top tier
Best  - Guest - EVER!
Best hot ones!!!
Unhinged and riveting
ROTFLOL - So F'n good....
After watching that I could imagen Conan standing there with a 12 inch wide hole right through his chest, and he would still be standing there looking at you a like "What?? Is there something in my teeth?"
Dr Arroyo could easily play Dr Moe irl
Conan watched Aubrey Plaza and said "Hold my crazy"
Llegue a llorar de la risa 😂 Conan es el mejor!
I dont think I stopped laughing in the last 5 minutes hahaha. Insane episode
best guest ever
This was as chaotic as I hoped it would be
My soul....and intestines hurt after watching Conan drink that hotsauce and rub it all over his face.  I don't think I've laughed this hard in so long. God I miss Conan, so glad he finally came to the show :)
"Call The Wife" LOL
HALL OF FAME
No one does it like Conan, even Hot Ones he takes it to another level. Much love Sir
Hands down the best episode ever!
Best hot ones ever!!!
❤❤❤
Conan is tall or Sean is small?
Best episode ever.
What the heck have I just witnessed!!!😂
this was the best one ever!
Incredible. Simply incredible 😂
Team Coco for Life
he took this down like a champ unlike the sloppy jalapenjoes on Murderville. Legit comedy GOAT!
Ive never laughed so hard…
Conan is the GOAT
You have to be a serious masochistic to handle these sauces this way.
What was this? Do I just not understand American humor? Was kinda gross
Conan really said "I'm gunna get bombastic with it" on the show xD. He CRUSHED those wings.
Conan is my Hero
That was Majestic AF. Thank you Sean and Conan.
I don't think I've ever seen Sean lose it like he did here. That was amazing.
Get Bill Belichick next.   Great episode!
I love Conan. I needed this. He is the king of hot wings now.
OMFG
Conan would get this reference...did he drink a candle before coming on the show?!
Conan upped the ante! 😂 best episode so far!
We need Jordan too!!
As somebody who has no opions on dumbles, i prefer the pedal into the fender in all instances in this video :)
There is commitment to the bit and there is COMMITMENT TO IT ALL
We truly don't deserve Conan, what a friggin artist.
Hall of Fame episode
Best episode ever! I friggin' love Conan, every single time he pocketed a wing was hilarious.
Dude is 60 and his living life to the fullest.
Jesus Conan calm down on the sauce lol
Conan licking the bomb🫣
Conan is an absolute nut job 😂😂😂
Did he just drink the pepper 🌶️ sauce?
i love conan! thanks for this
My favorite HOT ONES EPISODE EVER
FINALLY!
for being 100% performative...Conan actually handled the wings awfully well!
The best craziest interview ever Sean. Conan started normal and uneventful, but then ... went insane towards the end.
This is insanely unhinged yet profoundly important for the advancement of our world. Conan O’Brien has committed to this so hard and I am forever grateful. Conan 2024.
Noooo waaaay I’ve been asking for this for a long time. Finally 😭😭😭 thank you hot ones
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
If you novice, Conan turns more and more red with every wing! He might be able to pretend he's not feeling it, BUT his Irish skin tells the truth! 😂🤣
Finally!!! My two favorite you tube people on the same screen. Now if we can get John or Hank Green, it’ll be golden!!!😂😂
This is the ABSOLUTE BEST GUEST ON HOT ONES I STG
Did Conan just admit to killing Bea Arthur?
I think Conan overshot it. Dude brought too much flare, he should have let Sean and wings do their things and build it from there.
I am dead at him putting the leftover wings in his pockets
I freaking ❤️ conan ..i cannot wait for his new travel show...hes hilarious..his comedy is spot on....wayyyyy better than jimmy fallon..sorry
Conan never recovered and turned into hot sauce
This was a roller coaster ride, lol
DJ Khalid: “you played yourself”
I think this is my favourite so far. I’m from the UK, so haven’t given Conan any attention apart from the odd clip from his Late Show. Definitely be watching more of this guy. Reminds me of Robin Williams.
Do not like or engage with this comment for the algorithm
Bruh funniest episode I’ve seen in a while
Get Jordan Schlansky on.
FINALLY!!!!🎉🎉🎉
I think this has been the best episode for me in all them. The performance was just too good. Thank you Conan!!!!
i appreciate y'all getting the late night goat on the show
The memes that are going to come out of this doh! Lol
My sceptical brain is wondering if that's really those sauces in those bottles. They make their own sauce so they would be able create a new seal on those bottles although that could make them liable for a lawsuit from the manufacturers. Hmm...
I thought no one could top Eric Andre until I watched this…
This Has to be the funniest episode ever. My stomach hurts of laughing so much 😂
Legendary
Oh shoot! This is a big one! Thanks
Conan! Ahhh!!
My favorite episode hands down
I've been watching since the beginnings years ago. And have never posted one comment until now....This may be the best guest yet lol unhinged conan is great.
The most legendary performance to date. I don't think anyone is dethroning Conan on Hot Ones.
Conan is my hero.
Complete savage... this was great.
Make sense that the heat doesn't bother him. He is made of 70% milk.
Check my pulse... yes its there😂
Conando! 😂
Greatest hot ones episode of all time. Never to be beaten
This was Dave Grohl Rock'n Roll level. Respect!
Someone send this to DJ  Khaled, this is how it's done :)
Best Hot Ones interview of all time!!
What a champ Conan! lol
This was the funniest episode.  Da Bomb bit was amazing!
Yes, i love conan
Sean was abused  :))
Conan losing it at the end 😂😂😂. Amazing episode
BRO!! He's got to be on something!!! Hey probably needs a real doctor after all that!!
that doctor is sus...
Read widely, read well. - Conan
Goat
Unironically the best episode ever—I expected the inevitable Conan episode to be good, but not this good
THANK YOU.  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU
Dr. Arroyo is my new favorite Coco show character now
Conan is a comic legend 🙌
Dr. Arroyo is basically Dr. Nick
Conan just sacrificed himself on Hot Ones. It's essentially self immolation. RIP to the GOAT
Please have Chris Pratt on the show! 😁
I've never clicked on a notification so fast in my life??? It's like my new holiday classic.... Jingle all the Vay!!!!
The ultimate episode. Best of all time.
Best Hot Ones episode yet. Had me crying laughing 😭 😂
I didn't know Conan had that dawg in him like that   Edit my man is looking like a rabid animal 💀
Conan is one of my favorite people in the industry and by far my favorite guests of all time. I have some that are more emotionally powerful for some reason…but overall, Conan takes it!
The best of all time! This was soo good.
This is the best ive seen
Is it just me or did Conan got more tanned as the wings progressed?
That was simply insane
The best ever. I was dying the whole time. "I said it, and Ghandi said it. And Popeye." 😂
Conan is still the GOAT
Never laughed so hard. Hot one, great one.
Conan O'Brien is the best guess that you had on the show so far he is hilarious😅😅
The energy here is what this show is about.
I never thought I'd love conan o'bryan.... Now I do... This guys a rock star!  💪💪😂😂
the best episode ever
Off. The. Rails. 🤣
This is 10000% better than gordon ramsey's episode
This episode ruined hot ones by being the best episode?
TEAM COCO!
Sean looking terrified might be the best thing ever hahahahh,  superb
Im literally crying after 5 minutes reading comments and reacting to this episode! The best ever!😂😂😂
Did he seriously not feel the heat until Da Bomb???!!!!
i really hope jordan is with him.
At last, a guest who pockets those sweet, sweet chicken bones
Well, scientists have been saying redheads have a higher threshold for pain...I guess this is hard proof.
👏👏👏
he went to Thailand to film the show? Lets goooo
21:00 conan became the greatest guest in hot ones history with that.
50 seconds in and I’m already laughing. “I never saw a spice until I was 52 years old” 😂
This is even more definitive evidence that Conan is the best to ever do it. Never backed down and went for the hottest wing in history
This is right up there with Gordon Ramsay's first appearance as one of the ones we've all been waiting for, but there wasn't a single cell in my body that was ready for the performance that Conan gave. The man's a comedic genius, and even though he was so animated and boisterous he didn't seem like he was trying too hard to be funny like so many other people. He WAS trying hard to put on a good show, and it was incredibly funny as a result.
Conan bleeding from his eyes at the end was a great bit
This might be the best episode ever.
This interview was EVERYTHING I  thought it would be 😂😂😂 My new favorite! Oh...... sidenote........I'm convinced Conan is on drugs! 😂
That was the best episode ever.
my fav moment was when he licked the sauce extra for the first time
Pure chaos, beautiful
Towards the end I was getting a vibe of "Man i wish Chris Farley was around for this."
Sean, I thought one of your philosophies for this show is you would match the guest! Chug that hot sauce!!!
Pure Insanity
Easily Top 10 Episodes of the show, first GREAT ONES in a bit of time
King
Must see youtube here lol
Hats off to Conan for going the extra 10 miles on the season closer. Great guest!
You can tell how much Conan loves Hot Ones because what he did there was the biggest compliment you could give anyone in showbiz: pure gold for the entire interview. This interview will propel Hot Ones to even greater heights because of this man. A total class act, and a masterclass in humility.
Top 3 eps ever
That was superb.  What an absolute legend!
om g ahhahahahahah
YAAAAAAAAAAS!!!.
"Feel for the pulse" "yes, it's there" 😂😂😂
finally! conan is the best
yup, that was a perfect episode.
The messiah has arrived . there can be no second coming! Gloria!
Dead in 4 years least
SIMPLY GREAT!
Paul Rudd’s got nothing on Conan O’Brien
That was the most unhinged interview I've ever seen on this show
Man, saw Conan and clicked so fast!  Glad you guys got him on the show. 💜
So so unhinged
Friggin insane!!😂😂😂
I really need to see Conan followup on this in his podcast. The aftermath must have been brutal. Like that'll ruin your afternoon and evening.
Am I the only one that thinks Conan could totally play an old-school, over-the-top Joker flawlessly?
Legendary.
Di GOAT 🐐
he needs Jesus
best one yet!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was so unhinged. Epic.
You guys can quit this series right now. This episode just can't be topped
WITAF....
Well that was insane.
Best episode ever
Sean getting his props>>>>>
Who tops that!? That was best best appearance so far!! Insane! Love Conan!
Best episode ever.
FINALLY CONAN! this met and surpassed all expectations!
Greatest Hot Ones ever. “I’m not afraid of your wings, man.” 😂
Seeing Conan on the thumbnail for hot ones already lifted my mood
Best Episode EVER!
Yeeeees!!! Finally!!! Conan!!
The best Hot Ones for sure 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Instant classic
Is to ne is more exciting than gordon ramsey being on the show. What a season finale
Nothing ever topped the key and peele episode for me… until today
BEST EPISODE EVER
I want to auction off the jacket that Conan is wearing in this episode, wing bones unavailable.
I love that wherever Conan goes, he brings his show with him.
whats with the mile gap between them?
Is it too soon to ask him to come back for next season?
Top 5 best hot ones of all time
I’ve been watching hot ones for years, and that was by far the best entertainment that I’ve ever seen Gene Wilder at the end my God
Conan is the GOAT!
Flavor changer tabs.
What an animal 😂😂
Cancel Zio supporters & Free 🇵🇸
I think he should have refused the last dab and acted like Sean was out of his mind for suggesting such a thing. =P
Wow, that was amazing! 😂
Conan as the joker would make the rest look sane😂
😂😂😂 good show
CONAN IS A ABSOLUTE LEGEND
Level 12 amazing.
the freakiest guest so far 🤣
Love Conan!!
Conan the barbarian, slaying his foes. Tears traveling down his cheeks as bottles bleed out on the table. Pure gold!
This was epic!! Thanks guys 🔥👌❣️
Isn't black pepper a spice?  Irish guys eat that don't they?  When does Conan the bit end, and Conan the guy start or are they the same?
Oh sheeeeetttt
Conan took it to the next level 😮😂😂
Finally the G.O.A.T of late night❤🎉
YESSSSSSSSSSSS! our coco prayers have been answered
Check my pulse, Dr says “it’s there” Epic! Best episode ever. Conan delivered as usual
This was the best hot ones episode of all time
The day both his hair and stool were completely red.
Masterfully channelled EVERYTHING into being bombastic and insane, truly awesome
The Jurassic park sounding music at the end killed me
he’s usually funny but this just gives me creeper vibes, i don’t like it
i think the doctor has a doctorate in improv comedy
That was great. 🔥
The meme potential at 21:00 is unmatched
Absolutely the greatest episode ever. I have been subscribed since season 2. I am physically in pain from laughing so hard.
the bar has been raised
This is easily the best Hot Ones of all time. Please show us behind the scenes, backstories, just more. More Conan.
Awesome!
“was it a 4 year medical school?” *it was supposed to be.*
23:51 dabomb just spilling on the table while he gives his monologue about comedy is peak.
Charlie Rose throwback!
I’m cry/laughing through this episode.  Great way to wrap up the season.  Conan is literally 🔥
I have never seen someone with THIS MUCH enthusiasm for the sauces and I LOVE IT.
How long do yall thing that chicken wing stayed in his pocket?
GOAT Hot Ones episode
This was dumb
In high school I had the VCR set to record his show so I could watch it the next day after I got home from school. It was sometimes the best hour of my day. Absolute hero of mine.
i love them all, but this one had me in tears.
I haven't watched Conan in YEARS, but this felt like watching Late Night during my childhood.
I've been waiting for this episode for years!!! And I can only imagine Conan had the same experience backstage as Coolio
Wow.
Best one ever
Conan just soared to the top of the Hot One's list.
Makes Dr Spaceman seem smart
Conan absolutely brought it!
Great season finale, laughed so hard
Havent watched a full episode in a while, we all love Conan
Oh my gosh never laughed so hard. 👏 👏
Funniest video of hot ones , Conan made me laugh the whole time XD! ~~ shout out to Dr.Arroyo, you're not the best, but you're cheap ~~
This might just be the best episode of Hot Ones ever. I love Conan!
Grew up watching Conan, and it's amazing to see he's still absolutely got it today. Haven't laughed that hard in years.
Perfect guest, what a legend.
LETS GOOOOOOOO
I hope he's okay.What a show , hope nobody tries this again
Protect this man at all cost.
all time great episode. put it in the hall of fame
Interview Dr. Arroyo next season.
Conan's commitment to the bit is genuinely amazing. He should have screamed at the end "Take that Rudd!"
Been watching a long time and this is the best episode I've ever seen.
This was a wild ride from start to finish. Excellent episode! Insane season finale.
This is the best episode ever!!
This honestly blew every other episode out of the water. Conan is a legend.
Hot ones definitely made up for the Ice Spice episode. This was legendary.
I've always loved Conan. He would be the most insanely coolest friend. I just hope he is ok. Some of the funniest people are not. We love you man.
Second to last wing when he starts licking his fingers saying “YEAHHH IVE NEVER FELT SO ALIVE” he is perfect for this show 😂😂😂
Holy wings, that was intense. Possibly the best episode to date.
we needed this after the ice spice interview
was not enjoying the doctor sidekick until "my pockets getting full". well played, sir
JFC he largely unfazed by the hot sauces. Either he has a high pain tolerance or is largely uneffected by them!
Note to hosts: never bring Conan as a guest, because it's not your show anymore lol.
Conan certainty isn't afraid to commit to the bit...
After so many great episodes, I believe we’ve found the winner.
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
😂😂😂😂 wow that commitment 👏
YouTube should allow us to push the  "like" button more than once for such videos.
funniest episode ever!
Legendary Conan  O'Brien
Conan O'Brien just put so many guests to shame who brought like 20% energy, he brought it and then some and delivered 🤣🤣🤣
"The Other Guy" aka Jay Leno aka Arch Nemesis
I love this guy so much!
best episode ive seen!!
Best episode ever 😂😂
Far out Conan, that’s legendary!
There's no one like Conaaaan. I've loved him since the 90s and he's still got it in spades
Straight up one of the wildest Hot Ones haha, Conan is a peacock and you let him fly
Probably my favorite Hot Ones yet
Conan wins Hot Ones! Legit don't know if they have like an MVP award or something but Conan is the HOF GOAT of Hot Ones imo. The man stopped short of snorting a line of Da Bomb (which I was half expecting him to do) and was hardly fazed. Showed more concern for Sean's suede jacket then his own wellbeing. This is why he is the King of Late Night.
Jane Austen is funny.
its so funny that conan is so dedicated to the bit like the doctor being his producer and the wing in the pocket thing just kept going its so funny
Ok, I'm gonna say that Conan used a numbing agent on his 'ingestion path'.  However he did this, I am impressed.  I would have a river of perspiration running down from my head by the time I hit DaBomb, and Conan barely shows any effect.  What the.....?
i cant imagine the memes coming out of this one 😂
My fav ever!
Conan straight brought the excitement 😂 best episode in my opinion
FINALLY CONAN!!!!! This is my new favorite episode!
They finally got him to the show!!!!
It’s safe to say the Korean Spa remains the most painful experience Conan has gone through.
How old is Conan?  I'm not even 30 but his energy is rubbing off on me and i now want to sprint outside and do something fun and possibly dangerous!  Before this interview i was laying in bed sick, body aching and fatigued, but i feel nothing but high energy and i feel good! LOL i love Conan!
Best episode eeeeever! 🤣
THIS IS AMAZING
OMEGALUL
conan repeatedly asking sean if its okay to put the wing in his pocket after he'e done is gold🤣
In the year 2000!!!
LEGEND
He's a monster lol😂
I'm so happy to see this. Let's gooo
🔥This was beautiful🔥 How about Ice Cube, Kevin Hart & Conan next time!?
wow finally are you actually going to have good guests again?
He's going to die.
Nice
Well I opened youtube to find something to listen to while I played a video game but now I'm watching this. I love Conan and Hot Ones both.
This is THE BEST EPISODE EVER. the end. Nothing else needs to be said.
you finally got god on the show
this was an incredible yet insane watch
Conan's commitment to a bit is unrivaled.
Wow!!! This is, without a doubt, the best episode since 1998. 😂😂
INCREDIBLE! Just how though??? How the heck did he barely flinch the entire time???? God amongst spice eating men.
Conan's right, the Canterbury Tales is much funnier than most of the slop of the last decade.
I wish I had half the energy Conan has. His DNA is special.
And the story goes this was the last time anyone ever saw Conan RIP 🪦🌶️
I watched a man change colors in this episode .
2002 Conan!😤
If there’s a gerbil in there, it’s dead now.
Conan deserves all the first we feast awards after this one. He poured and LICKED da bomb sauce and kept it entertaining the whole time. GOAT
"I'm fine."
Last dab? Conan is the dab goat! 🫡
Conan is the absolute best 😂😂😂😂 had me crying laughing the entire show. What a finale!
If sona was there, she could have cured her lost voice on this episode next to Conan.
That was the most epic hot ones eating by a guest I ever seen! Conan is the GOAT!
That was classic 👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾
Conan is nuts! 🤣😂🤣 My favorite interview by far
HE IS AN ANIMALLLL JAJAJAJAJJAJA LOVE IT
my man Conan went off harder than Stev-o! 🤣🤣🤣
Da bomb humbles everyone
This was a ride
The best episode. So unhinged
what in gods name did I just watch.
Conan, the 61 year old talk show host is teaching those kids how to play the YouTube game perfectly
CONAN IS DA BOMB!  Best chaos energy ever and one of the top episodes forever! Learn ya boohoo kids!   P.S. It wont be possible to look for Da Bomb struggles from anyone else anymore, Conan defeated it for everyone.
"Letterman, he wouldn't say too much. The other guy.... Ya know. Idk where he was" - Conan won't even say his name lol
Watching his face get redder and redder through the episode 😂😂😂😂
😮
he's like a real life Dr. Nick Riviera
Somehow, this went exactly as I thought it would and, in true Conan fashion, still surprised me.
Epic! Absolutely Epic
Might as well quit now Sean, won't get better than this...
Didn't expect to literally scream "CONAN NO" multiple times while watching this episode. Absolute maniac and hero to all.
I don't  think Sean was quite prepared for what was coming 🤣
Conan bringing in one of his writers for a bit is totally Conan. Sharing the moment with other and not just about himself.
WOW!! Conan...Amazing!!!!
What an epic way to end the season. Nothing can’t top Conan.
Conan, the GOAT, to close out the season!
This was absolute chaos. Well done Conan, it was worth the wait 😂
absolute legend
He's such an epic personality...
Game over, Conan killed Hot Ones
By far the best hot ones ever. No contest
Anyone else stressed at the thought of him drinking Da Bomb from the bottle? 😮
Best episode ever
Hearing how Conan once got onto the back of a water buffalo unprompted really explains why he would pour Da Bomb on his wing and then lick it off.
This is so chaotic and I love it😂😂😂😭
bro the sheer level of unhinged is amazing.
Now this is a stable Genius. Truly Scrumtralescent.
Wish I could like this a million times
Jose Arroyo coming out of nowhere as the doctor killed me.
That was pure gold. PURE gold
BEST ONES EVER!
Greatest interview of all time 😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂
He is such a good sport!
Next up:  Jordan Schlansky
I have been waiting for a long time for this...❤🤣
Craig Ferguson would be an awesome guest.
i laughed  so hard at this episode!
legend
absolute laugh riot, im in tears, best episode ever! Conan for lyfe
We’ve peaked
Not even close to what I expected. That much better. 😂 witw
The absolute chaos of Conan literally bathing in the hottest sauces and not one "Careful around the eyes" warning. 😂😅
We love CoCo!
By far one of the best episodes! Conan just increasingly becoming more chaotic is exactly what I needed to get my morning going lol
Sean legit looked scared and amazed
Conan must've covered his tongue in candle wax before handling these Guatemalan insanity peppers.
Imagine how much more entertaining this would have been if Conan had not been holding back so much. 😆
Haven’t watched hot ones in a long time for some weird reason, but I saw Conan and clicked right away lol
This makes me realize it'd be really fun to see Conan spend time with Chili Klaus.
you can tell he was going to chug da bomb too but he started to feel it😂
fkn love you Conan. funny man
Best hot ones episode ive seen
Conan our GOAT of Late Night, never disappoints!
HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! AMAZING!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Like to views is crazy. Conan crew still strong
The Jurassic Park music at the end was simply perfection.  *Chef's kiss*
This was awesome :D
Conon is an absolute BEAST I think this is the best one I've seen WOW.
Bruh...
The doctor, the wings in the pockets.   This was a masterclass in comedy. My God this was a joy to watch.
This is by far one of my favorite episodes, it has everything you can want from an episode of Hot Ones AND some! The Dr bit had me rolling 😂😂 Starting with the overconfidence and never letting up, even in the face of Da Bomb. What a way to cap off the season!
Anyone else annoyed by the background music? I’m only here for my dad Conan.
Who would have thought that Conan could handle more heat that anyone
Conan literally went sicko mode.
I literally cried laughing, best episode ever!
Now THAT is the pre-Trump Conan i remember. I miss that guy.
the goat
You could censor out the wings, and it would be impossible to tell Conan isn't talking about edibles
This is legit comedy
Watching this while I sweat from my face from eating /sweet baby rays sweet n’ spicy bbq sauce. Ashamed that I would fully have to DJ Khaled this
Ok 😂😂😂 that was an EPIC FINALE! No one will be able to top this and makes anyone else after this weak in comparison! 😂
I needed to laugh today, and boy did this deliver.
Conan and Gordon Ramsey have polar opposite reactions with somehow the same exact energy. I love it!
Conan you deliver like grub hub!
The level of chaos is galactic
✨We’ve been waiting years for Conan to be here and it’s better than I imagined✨
Conan is like Benson eating buffalo wings on Regular Show
this immediately goes into the top 5 episodes of this show.  Instant classic.
GOAT'd with the sauce!
National treasure 😂
❤
👆 Conan 🔥🔥🔥🔥 ... This will EXPLODE 💯 ..
🐐 🐐 🐐 the best to ever do it!! Period!
I think Conan is the new goat! This might just top the Coolio episode
I wish Sona had been there too
Conan was, is and always will be the best in improv comedy. He'll literally risk his gastro-intestinal tract to make people laugh. Anything and everything for the joke. Love him forever 🧡
No way
Conan is amazing!
the GOAT
Undisputed winner of Hot Ones.
I absolutely love Conan. This made my day. :)
even tough every episode is great i can honestly say this was easily the best!! thank you
Conan understood the assignment. lol RIP Conan's toilet.
Conan is the GOAT
that why Conan O'Brien is the king of talk-show ❤❤
Legend!
Conan came and was Conan. He saw the wings, and he conquered. great ep
One of the best episodes of the entire series. Incredible
How is YouTube able to handle all this traffic!
I got a tear in my eye when Conan complemented Sean on his interview skills.
I love Conan O' Brien so much what a great episode
Lordy Conan sure is a mad lad.  This was an impressive performance
Welp, we've reached the peak. Conan is going to go down as the best guest in history without a doubt.
He is amazing. This episode was amazing. Easily the best show ever.  The only person who could ever top this is Conan O'brien himself. I have seen every episode and this one is without equal. I knew it would be good, but he left good sitting in the dust. Bravo Conan O'brien! And Bravo Sean for making this happen.
Yeah, this is the best one there will ever be
Best hot ones ever!
should've renamed himself to Cokean O'Brien lol
Legendary! Period!
Conan O’Brien —-> 🐐
Man of the people.
There's commitment to the bit, then there's Conan...
So satisfying! I knew Conan would not disappoint. He had that Nixon answer ready 😂
Absolute perfection, Conan is and always shall be a legend of Hot Ones.
He turned RED AF!!! The BOMB gets EVERYONE!! Hes gonna need a real doctor after this.
I am sad to inform that Conan had to have emergency tongue transplant after this episode was shot.  Fortunately, Doctor Arroyo was able to replace it with a Komodo Dragon tongue he bought from one of those costumed characters that hang out outside Hollywood's Chinese Theatre.
Conan is the GOAT for this. Incredible preformance.
Best episode ever!! 😂😂😂 That doctor put the cherry on the top 😅
The first 3 minutes 😂😂😂😂 hands down my favorite episode!
😂😅 by far the hardest I've ever laughed watching this show. And i love this show!
Conan the King!
I wish the doctor was Jordan Shalanzky😂
You know Conan has had enough hot sauce when his face matches the color of his hair.
LONG LIVE CONAN! Best of the Best
Conan is a living cartoon bro🤣
That was impressive!
what a crazy beautiful person Conan is
For every Ice Spice I hope we also get a Conan. This was great.
I love Conan!—— I love Conan…
Is this the GOAT episode...
This has to be the best Hot ones episode ever
Conan over here proving the point that redheads have a higher pain tolerance.
the GOAT, love Conan
Conan FTW!
Conan is the absolute GOAT
Conan downed all that spice and became so delirious that I'm pretty sure he's now technically the Kwisatz Haderach.
HANDS DOWN MY FAVV HOT ONES EVER🔥🙌🏻 Conan truly a LEGEND🫡
Conan is the chilli champion 🏆
Ohhhh....My....God.....that was comedy gold!  Love Conan!  This was the best "First We Feast"!
Did he end up in the hospital after the show?
Conan is literally insane 😂😂
LEGEND 😂
Conan still found a way to make this his show😂 "I brought a doctor"
best episode yet!
One of my favorite human beings ever
This was a crossover I didn’t know I needed until now
GOAT
One of the greatest personalities in our lifetime. It's so fun to watch how a host navigates their own interview since they've interviewed other people all the time.
Unbelievable. Team coco!
OMFG my favourite person in the whole world is on Hot Ones
What an episode 🤣
God I love Conan so much - this is the hardest I've ever laughed at a Hot Ones interview 😂😂😂
AAA FOOOKIIINNNNNGGG AMMAAAAAAZIIINNNGGGG
Best episode ever.
Finally, a Ramsay-tier episode
Conan is sooo much fun
Amazing!
This episode will go down in Hot Ones history! I absolutely ADORE Conan! I never hesitate to watch literally anything he's in! Absolute Gold this was! Conan never disappoints, and Seans delight and laughter just showed that he too loved and considers this episode Gold! Sean was too busy laughing, he probably didn't get to ask all the questions he meant to ask 😅😅
Jim carrey next😂
BY FAR the best Hot Ones episode to date. GG
I miss conan's show thu
my pulse was racing! i think i need the doctor
How d'ya like those apples!?!?! Eh!
How?
Invite Conan back and have him bring Jordan Schlansky
oh.... my... god legend
Conan's the best lol.
i was just getting back into my conan phase this is such great timing
God, gave us Gingers for a reason! He Da Bomb
BEST ONE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YAsssssss! Been waiting for this!!!
That was the best episode...full stop
Holy s***, best episode ever!
Sean that was your opportunity to show humility and credit the other person that writes the questions with you... Your ego has gone to your head.
Conan: "This is a whole new experience for me"  Me: *Eats popcorn faster*
I get it, Conan is a legend of comedy and TV, but I have to admit that his "doctor" actually made me laugh hardest.  Great interview though, thank you for this.
The water buffalo clip is up on his Team Coco channel if anyone is curious
Crying out for a guest to get really stuck in. Gonna take some beating. Kudos Conan!
Partially retired, and he's still got everything. I feel a little robbed that Andy wasn't there with him though, you definitely need to get Andy on the show now.
You knew he was going to bring it but MAN!!
For anyone not in the know, Dr. Arroyo is clearly not an actual doctor and is one of his writers that hes had for forever now
"I like to announce my mistake" 😂😂😂😂
This was, hands down, the BEST episode ever! I love how Conan went at it full force! 🤣
HE IS 60! HAHAH I thought the old episodes were my favorites, now I have a new one, thank you CONAN!
Wow. Just wow. What a get.
chuging the hot sauce bottle is iconic
Comedy gold!  I'm impressed with Conan's dedication to the challenge. Just amazed! I guess it's why he's the GOAT.
Absolute comedy gold!!!
Wth did i just watch.  Like. Its kinda disgusting but so joyful at the same time.
Conan is a treasure for humanity.
Conan: "What kind of doctor are you?" Dr Arroyo: "I should be."
The best guest ever!! Conon the beast 🤣😂👍🏼👊🏻💪🏼
This was legendary
he is wildddd
best show ever
All-timer right here.  Can't wait to hear Sona and Matt's takes on this episode on the next Conan podcast.
MY BEAUTIFUL KING YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!! 🗣 📣🔥🔥🔥❗❗❗
"Can I keeps these"😂
This was amazing. Conan was so funny. Great job Sean!!!!!
This has to be the  funniest episode of hot wings! I found myself laughing hysterically when each round got progressively unhinged hahaha
Conan proved once again he is  king of comedy. This was a legendary performance by a consummate professional. Well Done Hot Ones!
18:30 to me the beginning of the madness.  Only Conan could link Popeye and Gandhi, " I am, what I am."   The next sauce, Conan then starts to be his on-stage self, unleashed.😂
Conan isnt scared of Da Bomb.  Da Bomb is scared of him
CONAAAAAAAN i love him but he needs to learn how to not interrupt every single time. how come all men 50+ do it
I think what this episode showed if anything is that Sean and Hot Ones shouldn't be afraid to break away from the structure of the show more. Aside from the interview questions, Conan was absolutely on fire with his comedy in between. Would have loved to see more back and forth with them before going on to more questions, but maybe Sean just wasn't ready for that lol. Also the "roll out the red carpet" line that always gets said being overruled by Conan's hilarious yelling. Like maybe you don't always need to say the line Sean😂
thankyou conan.....the best ever hot ones!.....never change you are the best!
This is the best and most insane episode ever. Thank you guys.
Every single second of this video was comedic gold. This man lives, breathes, and clearly, EATS comedy. The inspirational speech he dropped at the end could only be delivered by someone as passionate about his art as Conan. This interview is going to be talked about for decades.
Instant classic
Dudes a madman
The best ever episode. PERIOD.
Wow, hands down, this is easily the best episode yet! I haven't been this thoroughly entertained in just 30 minutes in ages. Conan is an absolute gem, and Sean, you absolutely nailed like always.
Please get nardward
I m so scared of AI cause I said to my friend just yesterday that why arent they calling Conan on Hot Ones
Absolutely brilliant !! il have to show my mum this one! That was so fantastic. Much appreciated!!
Conan is still the world's greatest showman
This is it. No future guest can touch this.
BEST GUEST EVER
most unhinged one yet
JFC. The best==== GOAT!
Him drinking the Last dab & the Doctor bit :D:D:D Conan you're the greatest!
Conan is a legend
Conan is a mutant!!!  love it
This was hilarious, have always loved Conan
Conan Dr so funny
Conan's reaction to Da bomb after he realized it's not like the other sauces is the funniest thing I've ever seen on Hot Ones
Texas must be desperate for tourism.
What’s wrong with me, why can’t I feel? I feel you Conan 22:28
U gonna see the shade of redness hit real quick since he has the skin of a vampire
Steve-O, eat your heart out 😜
Conan lost his taste to covid and has no idea
this was the most uncomfortable i have ever been watching this program. Conan is truly the greatest.
i wanna see a Paul Rudd and Conan O Brien hot ones face off lol
After actual years, finally Conan came on. Thank you Sean and the hot ones team. Means more to us than you guys know
Is that a wing in your pocket.....
Legendary episode😂😂😂😂
never seen someone disrespect da bomb like that. what a great episode.
i’m literally screaming at conan through the screen HE IS INSANE AND I LOVE IT 😂
Conan should be voice a character for Solar Opposites/Rick & Morty
Conan is beyond epic. There's really  nothing else to say.
Definitely one of the best ever 👏👏👏
Who is going to top that? Conan is a legend!
A little DISTURBING but, Conan should officially be crowned "KING  of the WINGS".
favorite ep
Ending speech killed me 😂😂😂 Conan is the best
THISS WAS AMAZINGGGG
By far the best episode!!!
He better win the award for least reaction to these wings😭
Best Hot Ones episode ever. The only thing that can make it even better than best if it's Conan & Jordan Schlansky sitting side by side. Imagine the conversations & exchanges.
Best episode ever!  Conan is Legendary!
This is the type of chaos I didn't know I needed today.
Does anyone think Chris Farley sounded the same right before he OD'd?
Conan is my favourite person.
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!
Conan cutting a promo against the wings of death was not on my 2024 bingo card
I'm not gonna lie, I screamed through a lot of the last half of this
Best guest ever!!!!
WHAT IS THIS MAN DOING
It's over guys, Conan won Hot Ones.
I love Conan 😂
Referring to Leno as "the other guy" was ruthless ! :)
Finally the GOAT, no one puts chicken wings in their pockets.
BEST GUEST EVER!!!!!!!!
This has to be my favorite episode that has been released to date 🤣🤣
This was insane in the best way! Way to close the season strong, Conan.
Conan Forever!
There's iconic episodes, and then there's this one <3 Gene Wilder levels of greatness at the end hahaha
“You’re not a doctor are you?” “ I should be” 😂😂😂😂
Best episode ever.
what a legendary guy
Best episode in 10 seasons…
Comedy is in Conan's DNA. He's relentless.
This is impossible to follow... The master...
My favorite episode of all time by far
Funny and not political. So refreshing.
"What's wrong with you people?!? You don't know what real danger looks like anymore!" God, I love Conan.
ROFL oml I always loved Conan, Drinking hot sauce and dying for the comedy ! Dam I laughed hard Great Show! Love you guys and Conan is DA-BOMB!! Conan is definitely one of the GOATS!
CANNOT CONTAIN THE GOAT, BABY!!
Best episode, hands down. The absolute GOAT! Great job, guys!
About effing time! After that last three terrible episodes of Hot Ones (yes, they were horrendous), this is the redemption arc! Absolutely amazing having Conan on! Bring the pain!
the best one by a mile
What a f!@$ing legend! This was amazing 😂🎉
Perfect
best ep of the season for sure i love conan
This is so unhinged I love it
Sean just wrap the show. You will never, ever, ever, ever, never, ever get anything better than this. Hang it up and go out on top.
hands down the greatest episode ever. No I'm not biased 😅😂
I thought Steve-Os episode was nuts..but this episode was soooo  UNHINGED!!! 😂😂😂😂
I didn't know this game had a final level but I think Conan just beat it
Treasure, absolute treasure of an episode! God, I love Conan.
Milk pours out. “I have a show!”
OH MY GOD.  I keep shouting “WHATRE YOU DOING!?”
I've been requesting this for a long time thanks!!!! big fun of Conan
This cannot be topped. There will never be a better guest “I can keep these?” Puts wing in pocket 😂😂😭😭
He’s going to be in the toilet for the next two days 😂
This will have 100 million views for sure, Conan is the Comedy God.
What is going on
Congrats to Conan.  This was a performance worthy of the late, great, Robin Williams
Blown away by this majestic episode. Good luck Sean in topping that showman. 10/10🤯🤯
CONAN!!! ❤❤❤❤
Oh my god
NO ONE beats Conan. He is so funny.
Conan is the human form of intrusive thoughts/actions
Best episode yet. GOATED
Conan is and always has been... the G.O.A.T. 🐐
Epic.
And so it is done. The internet is finally complete
Conan is the Lisan Al-Ghaib of comedy.
I think Sean was like: _Ya know what?_ _I'm just gonna NOT warm him about touching his eyes_ .. lol
Just an absolute tour de force. Legend.
Oh this is legendary. Also this is so wild to see being a fan since day one when you guys were having obscure youtubers that had absolutely nothing to share on here and now you have Conan f*ckin' O'Brien.
Graham Norton next
LEGENDARY. Dude just opens the hot sauce bottle and takes a shot. Let's see you try that one, Ice Spice!
This was worth the loong wait def he will go down in  history as best ever .laughed sooo hard loved every minute
I was not expecting such a frenetic interview. Funny to watch, but unexpected.
Conan is amazing. I look forward to his show on Max. This is one of the 3 best episodes ever. Season 23 has been awesome
"You're not really a doctor are you?"  absolutely deadpan: "I should be."  Rolling!!
The new hot wings champ, Conan should take over this show
Conans diatribe on Comedy when it got to hot to stand....... truly Inspiring.
I'm so happy to see conan on here!!! "What is spice???" *Proceeds to rub hot sauce all over himself* This was absolutely wonderful, absolutely made my life worth living. My childhood self would have been so happy Theres just hot sauce everywhere 😭😭
Conan O'brien!!  You finally made it hot ones.  The highest achievement has now been reached,   nothing can top it.
BEST. HOT ONES. EVER. Love you Conan!
I only dream of being this ungovernable.
this is the best and craziest I have ever seen in HOT ONES!!!
Conan. Boss. Dude. Your toilet game is gonna be strong.
😂😂😂 great episode
The late night GOAT. They don't make em like him anymore.
Best episode yet.
What an F'ing CHAMPION!
This is the most Conan I think anyone has ever gotten a taste of.
This was amazing!
CONAN PLEASE COME TO BANGLADESH!! I AM YOUR BIGGEST FAN!!! You changed my lifee!
KING CONAN REIGNS SUPREME! 😂😂😂😂😂
I love the sheer mania on his face when his mouth is covered in wing sauce, chicken bits falling out of his mouth and he is exclaiming. "I'M FINE!" (at 23:00)
The bar has been set! I will forever be comparing the Conan episode to all future guests. What a legend! 😂😂😂😂
The late night GOAT. They don't make em like him anymore.
oh my gosh, probably my favourite episode so far!!!!
I am in tears!! Conan's a madman! Best Hot Ones episode ever. Let's see Jay Leno try that.
Perfection 🤌
18:54 quote of the century Yeah
Classic😂😂
I’m speechless and SO overwhelmed with joy rn lol I’ll be rewatching this episode for years to come… what a legend! I’m so glad this finally happened and the fact that it lived up to every expectation is beyond satisfying ❤ thank you to everyone involved for this gem. I now need to go ice my eyes from crying laughing.
Best Hot Ones yet
He's too much for me, not entertaining, sorry
23:06 pause and look at this man's face!! HE IS FINE!!
He had me cracking up when he made a whole mess near the end😂
Every moment was more unhinged than the next 😂 Full dedication to the bit 👏 Hope your tummy is okay after this one, Conan ❤
Eat with your mouth closed  Conando🤢
Comedians and women are the best people to have on this show.
This was amazing
YES
The bar has been set, and it will never be beat..
OMFG....Totally nuts 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I didn’t know what to expect from Conan and this was so much more.
I called it! I knew it! They said the finale was going to be big and I posted "It has to be Conan O'Brien". My comment is in the Shakira video
OK Sean, tell me now who really crushed it when eating the hot wings.  Conan is King
Team coco forever
Definitely the best one thus far 😂😂😂 Conan #1
This was everything I hoped it would be. I've never laughed this hard watching Hot Ones
Best episode ever 😂
Ice Spice was better as a guest.
The only one who was even crazier is Steve O, who pours the last dap into his eye. What a performance.
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!
The schtick with the wings, sauce, etc...Isn't funny and it's just disgusting...
BEST. EPISODE. EVER.
This episode was brilliant! THIS makes up for the last load of dud episodes through this season!
Conan was/is my favorite late night host of all time.
Sean looked super worried 22:37
jesus christ LOL
Best episode ever!
Edit: when did Conan knock over the bottles? The dialogue was seamless but with the bottles it just basically cuts to them knocked over. How? You don't show him knocking them over  Conan just decided he *is* the hot sauce hahahaha in the most respectful way possible, this was like watching a clown perform an amazing act
Conan is the best!
When is the Nardwaur Hot Ones?
I’ve never seen Conan so tan 😂
Torille! Tarja Halonen look alike and mentioned Finland!!!
Man thank god Jordan Schlanshky wasn’t part of this! It would have been funny to watch but Conan might have actually killed him.
LET'S FUGGIN' GO!!
Never clicked on a video thumbnail so quickly.
Conan recognizes a good suede jacket. Let’s not forget his Wilson’s House of Suede and Leather days.
its like conan slowly transform into the joker
Conan is unhinged and I love it!
I tried the Last Dab and I was underwhelmed. It was nowhere near the hottest sauce I've ever eaten. If you want hot, try East of Armageddon. That's hot. To quote Paris Hilton
Conan is the best, steals the show
I thought Shakira’s episode was the last for the season!🤔
Conan is a GOD! This was peak 😂😂😂
Hahahahaha
night and day to ice spice thats for sure
“Call the wife” 😂
I want the after show following Conan
This and Gordon are my two favorites
men this guy!!
I literally grew up watching Conan.... God, seeing him after so many years is like seeing an old friend... ❤
Conan is the GOAT
I haven't laughed this hard from a video on youtube in  years. Even when Conan was  saying it wasn't affecting him, his skin AND eyes were sweating....he really committed to making a great Hot Ones season finale. :)
Conan is my hero. He always makes me laugh, which is so important to a person with anxiety and depression. He understands and respects comedy, his piers and what he does. His integrity and joy makes anything he does gold. Thank you Conan!!
Conan, your sweat shows how spicy it really is to you...
Effin hilarious!
Conan is the ultimate. He may have started behind the desk but for a long time now his guests have been his contemporaries. He's truly an icon his character is something to aspire to and the idea of that is as funny as it is true.
I'm wondering how Conan's rendezvous with the toilet will go.
I love Conan so much! This episode is already legendary!
THE DREAM HAS BEEN REALIZED!!!!!! Congrats Sean and everyone!!!!!!!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩✨✨✨🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🔥🔥🔥🍗🍗🍗
I am in tears laughing. Conan is a legend.
Conan has still got it. This is perfect! 🤣
This has to rank in the top 3 most unhinged Hot Ones interviews 💀
CONANNNN THE WINGGG KINGGGG 👑
FINNALLLYYYYYYY😫😫😫
At a certain point I just became extremly concerned for Conan's health.
No one will ever top this performance 🙌🏾❤️🍗🫨🌶️🔥🔥🔥🔥
I see why Conan has such a beloved fan base. He gives so much without trying
Best season finally ever !!! Best guest ever!!! 😂😂😂
Sean looked genuinely concerned after Conan drank the Pepper X sauce straight from the bottle. The man was a maniac!
Insane.  Oh my.  :-D
IVE NEVER FELT SO ALIVE...love it Conan is the hot ones GOAT
Absolutely Perfect way of ending the season.
🫡🫡🫡🫡🥹
So happy to see José Arroyo still kicking it with Conan. I honestly can't say anything that hasn't already been said in the comments.
this might be the best episode ever
Can’t believe Im saying this but best episode yet! 😂😂
Yep. This is the best Hot Ones ever.
This was awesome! I'm getting some Bobby Lee vibes from Conan on this one. Although he definitely out did everyone that's been on the show including Dax Shepard who brought in his own wings!
Get some NASCAR drivers on there!!!!!!!
No exaggeration. Sean’s white whale delivered. Greatest guest over 20+ seasons!
Top 3 Hot Ones, possibly #1?
Every second of this video is its own legendary gif
The best late night host! ever!
FINALLY!
Usually, i only watch short clips of celebrities on hot ones. But i just can't skip Conan's.
CONAN THE WING KING
One of the best episodes on this channel.
The tragic irony of Conan’s career in late night is that he’s really more of a morning person.
I’ve never seen a guest go so crazy on the sauce it scares SEAN
what a legend
If ever we needed a full behind the scenes episode for a guest this is it.
Conan took those wings like a champ!!! The BEST one yet!!🤣
Never seen Sean so out of his depth. Best episode so far! 😂
THAT’S WHY HE’S THE GOATTTTT
sweet baby deep fried jesus that was intense
I've been watching this show from the beginning and this is the best episode ever! There's been countless great clips from this show, but Conan's last 15 minutes had me laughing so hard. I also loved how Sean was legit scared for Conan's life with Da Bomb, hahaha.
Thats was the most EPIC speech. Only by Conan.
This was amazing.  I love Conan, and always will.
This is the best episode ever. Simply put
I would never have thought that Conan is almost as crazy as Steve-O.
Conan had a legendary episode as expected. Love Conan great episode ❤. Can't wait for Conan must go
Absolutely unhinged in the most professional way possible! To be able to answer all of the questions and plug his new show when most people would be writhing in pain on the floor is truly impressive.
now he has to talk about his next day toilet story 🌝
Wow
Anyone else say "DONT DO IT" out loud to their screen?
I can't remember the last time I Laughed so hard. Conan is the GOAT
You know when the guest is feeling the heat when they use profanity 😂😂😂
Im clapping out loud at the show end while seating at my desk in my house alone today. I recommend you pause your work to watch this (:
Conan cracked it..😅..
i gasped so many times during this episode... conan is a showman to his core i love the man
Welp... I'm not sure what I expected...but it wasn't that.
Conan is so erratic and I'm here for it! I dunno how Sean keeps such a great rythm but that just highlights his skills as an interviewer.  This reminds me of the good ol days when Conan would dip down and go out of frame & then pop-up and hiss at the camera. Love this interview! Needed a laugh today.
Oh man, I feel sorry for the next guy that comes after Conan, this is what the show what's supposed to be, thank God he accepted, this is the perfect episode
this just made my day
Best interview ever!!!!
Him rubbing hot sauce sanitizer on his hands, bathing the da bomb sauce with no regard on the wing, and takin swigs from the last dab, to answering all of Seans questsions thoughtfully while slowly losing confidence in his affordable doctor was amazing. Conan is the kang of the wings and hot ones! 🔥
Conan was just GOATed. Wow. The man is unhinged, and I love it.
This whole interview is truly Conan. Taking everything to 100% 😂😂😂
This is maybe the greatest Hot Ones episode. Conan alternates between giving incredible comedy bits and real, thoughtful answers. And does the one thing with Da Bomb that no one has ever attempted. Hot sauce cannot stop him, it only makes him stronger. Bravo Sean. Bravo Conan.
I see Hot Ones has elevated to interview Legends now
Conan needs a golden wing for this episode. This was incredible. No wonder man is considered a legend in his own profession. Truly a Great finale.,
This is the new GOLD STANDARD for Hot Ones
Conan man! That man’s a 🐐!
how to take last dab to another level? dab every wing and drink the sauce
best one :)) i actually loled  through it
Conan:Check my pulse  Doctor: you have four months still funny
This was phenomenal! What a true entertainer.
This is the goat episode. And it's not even close.
I don't know if Brett Baker is still doing the "toughest wing eaters" Hot Ones power ranking list, but if this red-headed roughneck isn't at the top of that list with a BULLET, the world is a sham.
W.I.L.D.
There’s only one Conan, the best 👑 👑👑👑👑
That was absurd. How though.
Neat
Conan is such a tool!
Best hot ones episode ever
Whoa Conan killed it def top episode poor toilet 😂
Da bomb gon get you EVERY TIME 😭😭
This was Legendary!!!!!!!
MAX should just give conan a blank check and let him do whatever he wants for a show
I didn’t think when this started that I would say Conan is the best hot ones episode to date
🙄
😂😂😂😂 insane
It seems I have an important power tool over the industry which might work for me. It's not that I am hard balling but I will not waste Seinfeld episode of Christmas and Festive without asking for a duo interview on one of Conan's platforms with Taylor herself :D
The best hot ones yet!
Conan is a legend!
Conan will take any pain or humiliation for a laugh
I love this man
We NEED the uncut Version
The best ever. No one will top that one 🫡🇩🇴🇵🇷
This was hilarious I love the awkward Dr
Conan I salute you. You are the MAN
😂🤣😅🤬Dig the show. Wow👍
I don’t comment on anything but Conan has absolutely come and owned this so hard that no one else is ever going to compare. Good lord. Absolute effin legend!
This is the only video ever that I just had to watch again. Twice. It doesn't stop being so very good!!! Thank you for this gift of an episode!
what an absolute legend
This man is an absolute *_LEGEND!_*
Conon is the goat.
the GOAT
I thought Paul Atreides gave the best speech of recent years while high on spice.  But Conan at the end of this episode begs to differ.
This was the epic season finale!
Conan was fantastic.  A truly great Hot Ones show- the best.
Ive been picturing Conan in this show for years now and i gotta say, it went just as I expected. genius
The best in a long time!!
I don’t think any guest could ever top this. MAYBE Jim Carrey. 😂  Conan is a legend.
Conan is killing it 😂😂
Conan has Chris Farley’s spirit 😂😂 I love it.
Most intense episode ever! Conan is a mad man! Not even Gordon Ramsey could make it this intense and funny!
I get why they took so long to book Conan. After this it's all downhill 😂
I wonder if Sean considered this his grail interview. Would also love to know if not, then who is.
The interview I've been waiting on for so long!!!
He's still got it😂
DOCTOR ARROYO!!!
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!!
conan has brought me so much joy throughout the years, this episode did not disappoint
Conan is a true Maniac! Best episode of Hot Ones Ever!!
Dream comes true
sjeesh... Conan is a crazy person
By far the season ender
This is everything i could have ever dreamed of!
I had to pause halfway through to scream "NOOOO WHAT ARE YOU DOING CONAN". Best episode since Paul Rudd. Been a conan fan since 1994 and this man is a genius.
Seans makeup, oof
Conan is an absolute BEAST. I can’t believe it
Hands down my favorite episode so far😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Just found this. I know this will be gold 🎉🎉🎉
YES! YES! YES! YAYBOO YAYBOO!
Love Conan!! Best Episode!! 👏 👏
Love me some Conan.
Conan is the best. The best Jerry!
I’m 7 minutes into the video and Conan by far has already been the best guest in the entire history of this show. He’s brilliantly hilarious! 😂😂
I'm reading through the comments and I have noticed something. Yes, Conan is a comedic genius. Yes, Sean is amazing at his job. But not enough people are pointing out how Conan is just stuffing the bones in his jacket pocket! Love it!
Very funny episode
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME WHY CAN'T I FEEL?!?!
Unhinged Conan O'Brien is such a beautiful thing. Note: there is not a hinged Conan O'Brien, it's all unhinged.
Conan is  and always will be THE KING!!!  👑🔥🔥🔥
Ohh man, get Jordan next.
Wow .. I was waiting for da'bomb to karma the cockiness out of him .. but then he went beast mode and utterly dominated it!
Gonna be hard to top this one.
Best ever.
Just don’t get this guy, over the top cringe, just not funny. Very little originality, even less endearing personality.
🥹 06:59 - 07:25 💖
Conan was the funniest late night tv host
AHHHHH COCKAROOOOOOOOOOOOOO
he should rub the sauses into his eyes
What a LEGEND. Never seen anyone destroy wings like Conan
PURE GOLD
Absolute chaos!!
This is one for the history books.
as soon as I saw the thumbnail I knew this would be gold. 🤣🤣from beginning to end did not disappoint!!!! we all got to watch Conan descend into a mad man!😂 best season finale!
Why did this episode make me wanna wash my own hands 😂🤣
Who thought the baddest mfer ever on this show would be a super white Irish Conan.    😂😂😂  he rules!
BEAST MODE!!! The man is not human!! One of the BEST episodes to date!!!!
this must be one of the best episodes ever
I have never seen anyone be a champ like Conan is with the sauce 😂
Episode of the season, and of the entire show. This was the most unhinged, best, chaotic episode of all time and I have no clue how anyone will ever beat this performance.
Ice Spice, please take note
This is the greatest moment of my life
The most incredible episode yet. Legend.
King Conan
Conan what a savage dude.. 😂
What an absolute Legend!
That was amazing. All time classic🫡Hats off to you Conan!
Wow, I'm so impressed 👏
There’s a million ways I’ve imagined this interview going, and this is so beyond anything I’ve imagined. The only thing I did expect that played out is that Conan lifted himself to the top handful of all interviews of the show’s history!
Conan Da' Bombarian
Bro got the jennifer lawrence humour
is this the best hot ones episode ever everyone talks about?
This has to go down as one of the craziest Hot Ones of all time!
Funniest episode to date. Definitely worth the wait.
Conan is the OG 🤣🤣
Oh my gawd
Best Interview ever. Where's Triumph???
This is as chaotic and hilarious as you expected it to be HAHAHAHA - CONAN is the GOAT
This was really a finale 🎉
IM SO EXCITED TO WATCH THIS!!! AHH LITERALLY JUMPING UP AND DOWN!!!!!
This was the best one yet!
"Call the wife"
HE SAID HE DIDNT SEE A SPICE TILL HE WAS 52 YEARS OLD!!!😂😂😂😂😂
No idea how Sean didn't ask about Jordan, Norm, or the Simpsons. Great interview all the same. Hopefully they can get Jordan on for the most awkward episode ever
EPIC!
Probably the greatest Hot Ones episode ever?!!
This is one of those things that even without watching you can say is going to be one of the best episodes
This will forever be the best episode.
WHY CAN'T I FEEL?!
I’m going to need the behind the scenes for this episode. This was by far the funniest episode of hot ones I have ever seen. Excellent work.
“They used to call it HBO but people found it too popular!!!”
He poured the bomb … and licked it clean  Jesus Christ how is that man still alive
fun
Conan's about to turn 61, and he's still the funniest man alive. The end of this is utter chaos, and proves exactly why he's the absolute king of late night - he throws himself at everything and never holds back.
It was incredible seeing Conan turn different shades of red 😂
The comedy tv God just crushed it.
Major props for going full tilt
ASK JOHN MAYER AGAIN
What a legend
Conan... The legend just got more legendary!
That was truly savage AF I don't see how this one can be topped. I have always loved Conan but this gave me a new level of respect. This one is legendary already.
Single-handedly the best episode of the series!
Amazing
22:37 - Conan's just drank from the bottle and Sean looks terrified.
Conan GOAT 🐐!
Conan O’Brien is truly iconic. Thank you very much, Hot Ones.
Conan is my hero.  Gonna name my first born after him
I love Conan ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
conan giving Steve-O a run for his money
Conan is here in hot ones- yes yes yes yes!!!  It's only 27:21 mins long: NO NO NO NO NO NO!!!
Conan is the best.
Simply epic 😃
Conan is the greatest.  No other entertainer sacrifices himself for comedy nearly to the extent Conan will go (especially AFTER already have climbed for decades to comedy legend status).  This episode went way beyond my wildest expectations, thank you Conan, for everything.
33k views with 24k likes.... That has to be a record. Conan is the man. We'll done, Sean! Love this!
Last dab da bomb
Conan:  douses wing in Da Bomb sauce... aggressively licks wing...  Me: Ok. Ok Conan, ill watch your show...  🤣
Best guest evah
Conan the GOAT
He killed it! Anyone who chickens out in the future or complains too much, after Conan just threw it down, is gonna look soft. Respect! 👏
the greatest episode in the shows history
Anyone ever notice how conan looks like a IRL older tintin
I've been waiting for this episode for Conan to finally be on Hot Ones!! Finally, the moment we've all be waiting for!
This was just the level of chaos I needed today
How long did you go to college?  Was supposed to be 4 years.. I lost it after that😂😂😂
I loved his commitment to pretending it wasn't spicy, he's turning bright red, covered in sweat, "This the best you got?" All fell apart at the Bomb though.
Conan, I hope you know in the deepest crevice of your heart how much we love you. You are treasured by so many. Thank you for all you have done and continue to do to bring joy to our lives!
I love Conan so I’m excited for this one
feel the pulse. its there
🤣🤣🤣 Whew! My goodness! This was the funniest episode ever!!!! Conan is a Beast!
CONAN ON HOT ONES!?!?!?! YES YES YES!!!
A+ Very nice. Great success.
Best episode, thank you Conan!!
This went exactly as I expected it to go.
We are here witnessing the birth of a classic. Wish the birth of my children was this magical of an experience
I have never laughed so hard I had to pause so many times 😂😂😂😂😂
Absolute madman mixing all the hottest sauces on that last wing when rubbing in on that slate, and still being coherent. What a legend!
True madman.
It’s only been an hour but this is the best Hot Ones episode.
And the award for the most unhinged Hot Ones interview goes to… Conan we love you 😂
Best one yet!
New entry into the top 5 best episodes ever!
Conan really is the GOAT. Truly a blessing to us all.
BEST HOT ONES EVER!!!
That was insane 😳 Conan is the KING!!
“Read widely, and read well.” Conan, while on a downward spiral of insanity, somehow inspired me to look up for the funny things in books and life in general. 🐐
BEST EPISODE TO DATE.
Just epic.
Gotta put Conan up there with Rhonda Rousey and Tommy Chong as the best ever on here.
I've never seen him that red.
Wow Conan is UNFAZED 😮😮😮  EDIT: ok nvm he got an almst nervous breakdown lol
I have never been more excited for an episode of Hot Ones than this!!!!!
Love how Conan Hi-Jacked the role of host.
I couldnt click fast enough
Best.episode.ever.
Y'know... For 10 seconds I thought Dr. Arroyo was legit. 🤣🤣
This show just peaked!
Oh my god, the biggest episode ever
Seriously O'Brian isn't human!!!
Legendary
CONANDO
jesus christ Conan is tall af
I need an investigative podcast to explain how Conan endured this.
Best episode of the year so far, entertainment at its finest!
I haven't cry laughed this hard in years😂
He makes me a nervous wreck! 😳
I've had Da Bomb, watching Conan do that hurt my soul.. my god!
In the year 2000....IN THE YEAR 2000!!! Conan O'Brien will consume too much hot sauce and will spend the rest of the day destroying a commode that, oddly enough, looks just like Jay Leno.
This is a man what you called doing his show with his life
Greatest episode ever. Greatest guest ever. Well done!
Laughing so Much that Im crying!!! For ten minutes straight!!!….thank you!
Conan did his research, understood the show, and came in SWINGING
Who tf names their kid Conan.
interviewer interviewing an world renounced interviewer?! never seen that before!
Simplemente THE BEST invitado ever. Connan es un genio en muchos sentidos y esto es una prueba de ello
Conan is truly one of the best comedians.  Living with him must be exhausting
Best freaking show out there Shawn, Conan is absolute gold as always
Conan 'The Barbarian' obrien
Immediate rewatch that was a journey.  Sean getting his props from a living legend was such a a touching moment within such a chaotic interview
Conan is hands down the absolute GOAT
The best to ever do it.
Got to call it! Best Hot Ones episode ever!
I am convinced there is no person on earth that can match Conans chaotic energy
Oh my gawd.Conan is a badazz, nobody nobody has ever done that or will ever do that and the most he got was red faced… siping from the bottle!! Respect ✊🏻 king of wings 👑
NO FREAKING WAY!!!!!!! CONAN!!!!!!
Best hot ones EVER!!!
still waiting for matpat episode
This is one of my favorite interview....Conan was hilarious 😂
Some good drugs involved
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 this has been one of the best episodes so far.
Conan is great. Best episode.
Every time he said Max I was thinking of Max Weinberg. Also I was hoping for his doctor to be Jordan Schlansky
This was definitely the wildest episode after steve-o :D and I absolutely love it!
Conan is the king! This is the best episode yet! Crying tears of laughter
I'm crying. That was the best. Conan is on a higher level than any other late night host lol
Conan is from another planet lol! His since of humor is far up there in the pantheon of the art of being funny all the time.
What a beast!
This immediately rocketed into the top 5 episodes if not #1
Conan continues to be my favorite person in existence
That was insane!
Used to love Conan but he's gone downhill. His podcast should be called the sona podcast.
I'm guessing Conan had his stomach pumped after this show...
Just end the show now. It's never going to better
INSTANT. CLASSIC!
I’m yelling “Conan, no!!!”   Throughout this episode.   He must be hurting
what a LEGEND! god i love Conan....
I don’t think anyone will top this episode 😂
That was a great one
Holy Smokes!  Wow!  Sean,  you have been officially knighted by King Conan, The Irish One.  All milk just sold out for Conan to bathe in.   Amazing! Congratulations Hot Ones and TeamCoco! Best guest ever!   Da Bomb has officially met its match! Why we love Conan.  He is who he is.
😂😂😂
I really thought the wings they gave Conan weren't hot after the whole spiel about him being from ireland. That's why he wasn't reacting to the first couple wings and even chugging hotsauce. Now can't believe he had so much of the bomb sauce. Conans GOATED.  🐐
This is simply the best Hot Ones episode of all-time. Its official.
Finally a great guest Shakira was aight but now its going to be fun
Why are they still 6ft apart…..?
This is peak TV right here
Unbelievable episode, my favorite one ever, Conan really took those wings like a G
Man, this episode literally had me in tears. Conan is always a treat.
Conan is incredible he's a funny guy cool interview for this Season's Finale Congratulations Sean on another great Season looking forward to the next one
Awesome Conan ty so much
one of the best episodes
I love him calling Leno "the other guy" 😂😂😂
One of my very favorite episodes.!
Conan is a tall guy! Wow hah love his comedy style
love how he is just eating the wings and being so...this isnt phasing me when you know he can feel it but hes playing it off, so Conan
This the best video I have ever seen in my life!
Best one yet! 😅
This is going to be one of the most-viewed ones for sure!
Makes me proud to be an Irish American
CONAN!!
the color change in conans face from beginning to end is so funny
Conan: "You Just feel for the Pulse" Doctor: "It's there..." Had me dying :D
"Whats wrong with me? Why can't I feel?" best hot ones quote ever, right up there with Paul Rudd's "Look at us!"
Soooo good. Someone check on Conan today...
he would be make a great supervillan
I can't believe this is finally happening! I appreciate that Conan was being his goofy self between the questions, but answered the questions seriously. We rarely see that side of him.
Boss level! Conan has changed the game.
Absolute LEGEND 🤣🤣🤣❤❤❤❤
Pimpbot 5000 and Triumph bits... height of late night
Conan will do anything for a bit.
Conan is just a naturally funny and entertaining gentlemen
Conan turned into Lewis Black at the end. That was amazing!
Conan will need a doctor after that. Not Dr Arroyo. Wow!
I freaking LOVE Conan. Hahaha What an amazing finale.
@16:45 I died! I literally crumpled up in shock and horror and died! :O :D
He took it like a god bro
Yesssss
That was absolutely unhinged.
This finally takes the #1 spot over the Ramsay episode.
I love Coco but the bits just didn't work here. I don't think the format lends itself well to Conan's comedic bits.
king
This man needs his flowers. Sure, he’s an iconic host and amazing personality, but his demolishing of each of the wings, is statue-worthy. FirstWeFeast, he deserves his own hot sauce!
This has to be the greatest interview I've ever seen... conan was my dream guest and I am so happy and fulfilled about this ❤❤❤❤
Conan is completely insane and i love it. Man is made of steel, oh and psychedelics
About time! Conan is the last great talk show host. In my opinion he’s my all time favorite. Love this guy.
Peak comedy conan
BEST EPISODE EVER
I've been happily watching him since '93. Team Coco 4 life.
Huge props to Sean for keeping it together!! Unhinged Conan was insane and hilarious to watch!!!
Why is he pocketing his wings? He afraid someone will steal n copy his DNA?
Sean usually matches the person he's interviewing, didn't see him putting chicken in his jacket tho :V
Epic finisher! Conan the GOAT, great guest to end the season.
LEGEND...just pure legend...wow lol
Conan is the best talk show.
This is one of the best episodes of hot ones. It was a slow season but ended perfectly
I’ve never witnessed such jaw dropping chaos in my life 😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is the best episode to date hands down
What a fever dream
i LOVE that Conan set up skits specifically for Hot Ones, and so great for Sean to meet with somebody he's looked up to for years.
Conan is the GOAT. Hands down.
The last five minutes of this are probably the most comedic meltdown this network has ever seen. Conan, you a legend dog
conan the barbarian!!
Conan is Beast
Holy moly seeing Conan commit this hard really hits home how bored I was watching Ice Spices interview. Conan is the GOAT and this is an episode heading straight to my top ten favourites.
Finally, a good guest.
At this point hes high from the hot sauce
I expected nothing less. Absolute legend.
who would have thought that there could be another absolute hightlight? with/from an a-lister nonetheless?!  conan just entered the fire wings heaven right next to gordon ramsay 🥳
His monologue about reading reminds me of my Balkan uncle after a family lunch when he's talking about the Serbo-Croatian war.  ❤ Memories
23:41 I never thought Conan would make me emotional about comedy 😢😂 what a great end to the season 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This is the best🙌🏻
THE LEGEND
this was definitely my favourite episode by far, Conan is even crazier than I thought😂
This was legit. An amazing episode. It had me laughing so hard and surprised the whole time. Conan.....11/10
this is without a doubt the best Hot Ones episode of all time.
Conan is a national treasure.
I always thought Conan was a little bit too arrogant and weird but him downing those wings gives me a lot of respect for him. (I've tried da Bomb, it is evil)
Best show yet
Conan might be the most unhinged guest this show has ever had. And somehow he has the best pokerface.
Conan is such a gem. I was hoping they'd get a little more serious since Sean (and team) are so good at making good questions, but this was classic Conan and I am here for it
Pure mayhem and comedy. Pure Conan. Thank you!
Wise words from a wise and stale man
Aries rule! Built for heat. 🔥I’m just glad he didn’t bash Trump this time. Great job Consie I’ll check out your show.
Jesus, 10/10 guest
Conan is sooooo crazy 😂😂😂
Amazing episode but totally missed opportunity on wing 10 they should have played the song from Jurassic Park
"Dr arroyo, can you come here? My pockets getting full."
God protect this man. A national treasure.
Oh he worked for that. It was awesome 😂
Watching Conan lick the hot sauces made me realise he learn nothing from the water buffalo experience lol
Jesus... I am sweating just watching that...
Now THIS is the Hot Ones episode I've been waiting for for literal YEARS
UNHINGED
Phenomenal way to end the season.
Conan giving me Joker vibes with Da Bomb
This has made my week
The last 5 minutes of this interview is the funniest thing I've ever seen
Conan always doing bits. He’s so unserious. I love him so much.
Good god we have been waiting so long and I am NOT disappointed. Conan + Sean = PERFECTION
Conan is unmatched.... this guy is peak comedic genius. His energy is unreal. I think if you were with him at a dinner and got him going he'd probably act the same. It's really not a bit, just him.
Conan still calls Leno "the other guy" 😂😂 he WILL NOT let that go 😂
13:42 Conan casually drowning the wing in sauce is the highlight of this episode for me. I don't think I've seen anybody else do it. What a beast
The show just PEAKED
High praise from Conan for your interview skills
Next season, I would love to see if Sean can get Stephen A Smith on.
His poor mother, can you imagine raising a child like that? 😅
hands down best epidode😤👊🏼
Best guest of all time and it’s not close
Unhinged.
From the first time I saw him, he's been my favorite.. NBC f'd him so hard.
Yayy!!! Conan!!
21:06 when someone ask me how my year is going👁👄👁
Hey it's conebone69
I knew it would be good but wow!!! I’d hate to have to use the bathroom after him. 🤢🤣
Conan will go down as the most amazing guest in Hot Ones history!!! Love this dude.
Conan the Wing Destroyer
I have been obsessed with Conan since I was a teenager! I’m 44! I got to see him when I was in my mid twenties and he was hilarious! Looooove you coney!!!
Conan, the best TV host finally meets the best Youtube host
Hands down the greatest episode ever. Good luck anybody ever topping that. Conan is a LEGEND!
Conan the real G.
❤❤😂😂
in all seriousness his passionate speech on where to find comedy at the end might be the most beautiful thing i've heard in months, possibly years
Conan is going to have a stew going later.
i almost died laughing. funniest thing i've seen in a very long time. LOLLLLLL
HAAHAHAHA CONAN, I LOVE YOU SOOOO MUUUCH!!!! HAHAHAHAHA BEST EPISODE EVER!!
Conan has not only joined the pantheon of Hot Ones greats, he may be actually be on a level unattainable by any one else.
I love it
I was not ready for this. Legend.
Initially i was really tired of the bit and wanted some realness from Conan.  But when he slathered his hands in sauce and rubbed it on his nips, i was all in for this interview. Fantastic and hilarious.
Ok. You made up for ice spice. Thise was gold 🤙
The ending is pure genius
My stomach hurts from laughing so much. Best episode this season 🤣🤣🤣
Best guest Ever
This was such a great interview,one of the best one for a while  Conan did great hahahahah hes lost his mind lol
Conan deserves all His flowers 😂 this man never fails to make me laugh!!!! Best episode ever!!!!!!!
BEST GUEST EVER😭😭😭
I can't remember the last time I laughed this much
Conan needs to bring his show back, but to YT or Twitch. I guarantee you it would be popular. He was the best late night host because he was actually funny. The only other host that I can think of that could touch him was Craig Ferguson who was also hilarious.
starting at 20:30 is absolutely hilarious. That's why we love unhinged Conan
We all know that Conan performed the greatest  hot wings here. What a guy. He's off his rocker in the best way. Great show!
Best episode ever!
FINALLY
Conan is so unhinged and I freaking love it! His remotes here on YT are amazing.
Can I keep these wings?
This was insane!! I got so excited that Conan was on and he didn’t disappoint. This was by far the best episode I’ve seen. What a way to end the season.
Conan is a legend
Happy earlier birthday Conan! Thank you for the best final episode!🎉
This episode is peak
God I love Conan, this is by far the best show of Hot Ones ever.  There’s nobody else like him. I know it might sound weird but he’s the Eminem of talk show host, reaching a wide audience regardless of his age.
Absolutely epic. Conan just threw down the gauntlet saying "I dare anyone to try to have a better interview than mine"
That was the most amazing display of adrenaline fueled improv I’ve ever seen.  Conan deserves a very large trophy.
Conan making his rounds is the greatest gift
This will go down as the PEAK of Hot Ones.
DA' BOMB after the interview: "No way was that a 60-year-old Irishman."
no words 🤣🤣🤣
Conan is the best
Conan is such a treasure
Sean seems off his game in this interview. Feel bad because I love conan. i wonder if they didn't jive before they filmed.
Most legendary Da Bomb moment I've seen.. Wow!
Sean: "Careful around the eyes." Conan: *pours Da Bomb straight into his eyes*
Conan just straight up owned Hot Ones. What a way to end the season
How someone can bring so much innovative comedy to a show that has been solid for this long is impressive in itself. Conan is the BEST, therefore this episode is also THE BEST😂
Sean just hanging on for dear life through the chaos that is Conan 😂
This is probably the best one
Conan has cemented himself as the GOAT and Da Bomb remains undefeated!!!
conan is WILD😂😂😂
Gotta give Conan props. Never been a fan . But he handled that better than I thought he would.
Hands down the funniest episode of all time! Conan the Legend! Conan the Barbarian! haha
Conan O’Brien: Comedy. Legend.
That was emotional to watch. My dear, sweet buffoon.
I love conan ❤ but I was kinda worried when he started drinking hot sauce from the bottle 😅
WOW!
Later that day: "hey Conan, gimme some of your wings..."
OH MY LORDD ITS HAPPENINGGGG!!
conan is top 5 all time comedians AND hot ones guests forreal
I thought the last episode was the season finale lol
WOW !!! That was the best episode EVER ! Next to Lorde and Gordon Ramsay, here it is Conan O'Brien. Incredible comedy, eating and interview. Respect.
This one was EPIC!!!
This is COMEDY GOLD!!!!
GOATed
The stethoscope on the tongue followed by "It's not good" elicited the largest belly laugh I have had in years.
RIP CONAN 😂
This is my new favorite episode of this series! Epic!
Thank you Conan! You never disappoint! Whenever I feel down I watch Conan travels. You  (ALWAYS) lift my mood and have me laughing out loud. So glad you finally did "Hot Ones". 🔥
This is the most deranged interview Sean has ever done. Love. It.
This is hands down the best episode of this show. Conan is a legend. His speech at the end has the same intensity and passion as Charlie Chaplin in the Great Dictator, and is similarly inspiring.
I am perfectly fine (glowing red faced due to blood in the face to overdose of chilli), I salute to your madness
i think this is the first ever hot wing induced psychosis 😭
I’m probably in a small minority … I did not enjoy this interview.  I love Conan … but this was too frantic and not insightful into him.
What a performance! 👏
Bravo!
conan's energy cant be beat
The craziest red head personnality to be on Hot Ones so far!
legend
- Where did you go to Medical School?  - Aaah… in 1998  - WHERE  - Ouw, aah… out of State (Mild casual chuckle)
Great episode, finale.
best episode ever! never though that Conan would participate i'm so HAPPY
That was epic!! It may be better than Thundercat’s showing.
now the internet knows THE REAL Conan O'Brian.... an aggressive, Irish, spice GOD... DID YOU SEE HIM WITH DA BOMB??! 😮😮😮 good lord all Neal to the new king of hot ones
Top 3 interviews right there, Conan the GOAT.
Legendary! So fun and crazy in same time. Best guest , for sure!
Conan is a national treasure
Conan is the King! Long live the King!
OMFG YES!!! I jokingly said to my fiance last week when you mentioned the finale, "imagine if it was Conan" thinking that there would be no chance, but i knew he was doing press for his new HBO show, so i was hopeful!
is this the craziest-most-insane bit Hot Ones' done? 😂
FANTASTIC EPISODE! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽  This is one for the books! 🌶️🌶️🌶️  He stayed in the bit… all the time! ⭐️
😂😂😂
ICONIC! My jaw was on the floor 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is how you do hot ones
The best episode
Greatest Episode Ever!!! 😂😂😂
Suomi Finland Perkele mainittu, torille!
This was absolute perfection. Conan woke up this day and chose chaos 🤣 🍗🔥
As a person that took on the 10 wing gauntlet, coma’s gonna be a hurting man on his next visit to the toilet as he hymns “ the burning ring of fire” 😂😂😅. As a guest tho, he’s won’t be beat. Conan has a mindset going in there as invincible and boy did he deliever. I could have watched this interview go in to hours. Amazing job
Let's go, let's go everybody!!!
The best to ever do it!!!
I have been waiting for this my whole life, and I didn't even know it.
Conan should be forever considered the ultimate badass champion of this show.  That was awesome.
The World is now a better place!  Thank you for this interview coming to fruition, the spiciest, feastiest conaniest  feast of feasts!
this is up there with the paul rudd episode
He might want to see a real team doctor's now
Conan the sauce barbari'brien!
amazing episode!! way to close the season!
😅😂
Amazing!!!!  One of the best.  I can't believe what Conan did with Da Bomb.
Therapeutic laughing 😂
whoever said you couldn't become a legend by having 2 days of diarrhea was apparently wrong. Conan made all future interviews hard to outdo, reaction wise.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the greatest comedian of the last and next 500 years!
“I don’t fear your wings”
I was like Oh Myyy Gooood is he going to sip the Bomb bottle! From facing the bulls of death to the wings of death, this guy does it all! LOL
I'm dead I'm Mexican and eat spicy but when I say I tried 5 drops of da bomb on wings nd I was like OK I get it this man just licked a glob I knew I was like here's the change
After I pay for dinner 🤷‍♂️ 16:57
I’ve waited so long for this
best thirty minutes on youtube
Conan's chaos is sublime
Oh my GOD.
the G.O.A.T.!
I thought he said shakira was the last of the season??
He's alike Robin Williams not looks like Ric Flair
true master of his craft. full commit, no half assing. no one has ever dumped and licked da bomb before the Goat!
I've been crying from laughter all episode long. That's been the wildest episode in a while.
COCOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!  Legend!!!!
Came in knowing it would be a great one. Boy did it far exceed my expectations. One of the best ever.
Just a man at the top of his craft here. A true professional.
Internet: Do your thing. We got to see that water buffalo footage.
WOW.  Conan lost feeling in his mouth at the end...the drool .... the rant...  poor guy!  He is going to feel those wings for at least two days when they come out the other end.
This is by far the most chaotic and hilarious episode ever! I don’t know if anyone will ever top this! Thank you Conan!
He's gonna feel this for weeks.
Hands down the best episode!
This is the best Hot Ones I have ever seen. Fn hilarious
😮
We all know Sean and the First We Feast research team are awesome, but hearing praises from one of the best interviewers in the US must be such a professionally satisfying moment
Conan O'Brian needs to hit the "F ck it, I'm going for it" button and run for President.  He'd be incredible!
This man is insane he didnt even turn red!
Conan the Great.  This became his studio.  I hope the other guy learned a few things.
Best episode ever
He told the water buffalo story with one better detail another time, he said that Andy peaked over the newspaper he was reading as Conan was climbing on top, saying "I wouldn't do that.".
best guest ever! 🏆
Other than Rachel ray I’ve never seen anyone just drink the hot sauce.  I’m amazed Conan was drinking the bomb.  Sean’s dying in the other side of the table the whole interview.  Does anyone else see some Robin Williams in Conan?
Was that for real? He is fuqing savage! So good!
This is the most impressive thing on this platform!
This made me laugh so hard. I needed that today.
I know this was filmed recently, but can your team confirm that Conan is still alive today?
Conan is great. Always funny. 😊
GOATED episode
This is by far the funniest Hot Ones I have ever seen. I've watched since this series first started, when people tapped out on wing 5. When the names of people interviewed were not as well known. But this? This had me laughing out loud. Conan, you're a pho-king icon man.
Simply 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
this was legendary!
I haven’t laughed so hard in a long time. thanks
My fave comedian!!!
He’s completely insane this is hilarious
Genius and madness draw a very thin line and that line is Conan O'Brien!
Haha he got a Nixon motorboat out of him
The best show hands down ❤️❤️🔥🔥 love this man. Authentic mother f****
Absolute maniac
Whatever the Ice Spice episode was, this was the opposite.
Now that 💣 was impressive.
by the end he looks like a giant baby with apple sauce smothered all over his mouth oh my god😭😭😭
conan is insane - GOAT
One of the best episodes hahahahahaha goat Conan
Max Weinberg watching this thinking "I thought he liked my name?!"
Wow, what a ride. Conan is unreal. :D
Future episodes now: “ It’s tradition to put a little extra on the last 5 wings, you don’t have to”
Wow! Every episode is fantastic but this was knocked out of the park! I'll be rewatching this one a lot. Conan is a madman and I just love it.
"That guy" here.  A real doctor would have monitored for signs of anaphylaxis. Such as blood pressure, pulse, mental status, airway, hives and pruritus. But then it would not have been funny.  An irishman who self reportedly grew up without spice who was able to stay in character till the bitter end and not be in a quivering fetal position is worthy of respect.
Greatest interview ever
He literally destroyed the show😂
Conan destroyed the wings!! Now wings need a doctor from 1998!! 😭😆
The setup was brilliant, the performance was masterful. This is the difference between true professionals and wannabes. I'm sure they had to scramble the air schedule to put Shakira in between Conan and Ice Spice otherwise the difference would've been too shocking.
I like how the camera stays on conan because he just keeps getting crazier
Best episode ever
The best episode ever 😂😂😂. Conan will literally risk his life to make us laugh.  What is wrong with him?
Doctor Royo(?) needs to be a recurring character in the Conan universe.
Team Coco!!! Oh my god! He is the greatest guest ever. No one will ever top Conan O'Brien. I give him three weeks.   Sean, you have seen your own Coronation. You are now the King of talkshow hosts. But, that's according to Conan O'Brien, who is obviously insane. Still, you're the King! I must now go hurt myself in solidarity with the, "Irish One".
No question this was gonna be the best episode
Best episode in the history of the show
hahahaha Conan is the man!!!!!
I’ve watched every episode over the years and was an early subscriber…this is pure gold and Conan was THE best guest ever!!!!
An office in the desert 🏜 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏
conan is my birthday buddy and my favourite stand up late night host, he is a hero, i love that he is on hot ones! I hope Sean gets to be on conan needs a friend!
The catharsis Conan must've felt after that. A 30 year career of interviewing guests and now he gets to be one. Conan just shattered the bar for Hot One's guests while giving himself an ulcer in the process. That's commitment to comedy.
This is the best hot ones episode ever. Unhinged. And Conan putting the wings in his pocket is my favorite part
I love watching Conan, he is so crazy. Does anyone know how Conan did feel after the show?
23:08 I’m fine perfectly f***** fine 😂😂😂😂
This is the best episode ever!!! I wonder if Conan will take Andy on his new show.
This episode isn’t a interview show it’s just one long extended bit that Conan played to perfection
"I don't fear your wings, man."  Famous last words.
Best Guest ever i love conan❤ the pure embodiment of commitment 🎉
I was just listening to his Needs a Friend pod this morning!  This is fantastic!
possibly the greatest episode ever
THANK YOU SEAN!!! Hands down GREATEST GUEST EVER!!! Conan is a GOLDEN GOD!!!
This was perfect 😂😂😂😂
Jesus Christ 😂
Dude, did Conan just have an emotional and mental  breakdown on hot ones!? 😂😅
Best episode EVER🎉😂
That was incredible
Conan is the only funny late night host left even tho he doesn’t do late night any more 😂😂😂😂😂
Now go back and watch ice spice. There, I just ruined your day.
Conan just provided Hot Ones with enough memes and highlights for Sean to retire and not suffer through anymore heat! 🥵
not only was this absolutely hysterical, Conan embodies what it feels like to go out and eat wings in public. The joy and the mess of it all!
I'm somehow crying near the end, what a career Conan had of dedicating his life to comedy, sometimes making a fool out of himself and making us laugh. Team COCO for life!
Conan pocketing the wings is golden 😂
Without a doubt the best episode of hot ones ever!
Most insane episode i've seen... in the best way possible
This is gold 🤩🙏
Epic episode!!! 😍😍😍
Best. Episode. Ever!
"This is not a bit! Doctor, check on my friend here!" 😂
6:25 "The other guy" lol
This is awesome!  One part of me is totally surprised that Conan is here and another part is thinking Conan should have done this a long time ago.
Conan was trying too hard too be funny and it got old (and a bit obnoxious) fast.
There will never be a better episode than this.
Legend.
I laughed so hard. Best episode, yet!
Oh they got the GOAT. This is gonna be great.
best episode EVER !
This was amazing! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
So rare to see something not only live up to the years of expectation but to sail far beyond it.  Easily a Top 3 episode ever.
No one cares about comedy more than Conan
One of the most degenerate episodes I've ever seen I'm dying laughing here
This episode is instantly in the Mount Rushmore of Hot Ones!!!!  If Conan isn't a first ballot Hot Ones HOFer there is no God!!!
I want to see Sona and Matt on here with Conan all egging each other on while simultaneously melting down 😆
I don't know why, and I'm sure people will think I'm crazy, but I literally cried at the end of this interview because this was watching someone Completely go for it and give his everything for this opportunity to try to make it great.  Conan O'Brian is a true genius.
at first i thought he was switching the bottles with the doctor but WOW, Conan actually ate more hot sauce than other guests ( i think), that's impressive - i couldnt stop laughing. Conan is the best!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥so glad he's getting out into the world again to do comedy. We need Conan!!
He is Muppet right? 😂
This is the best one yet. Everyone knows this to be true.
Sean needs to do his own reaction video to this episode. Conan was out of control and hilarious. I also want to know how Conan felt the next day.
the best hot ones guest ever, after paul rudd and gordon ramsay
Conan is a emeffin' legend. I used to watch his show cuddled up with a girl named Ocean, after listening to Island in the Sun by Weezer, night after night back in my college days.
The genuine look of CONCERN on Sean's face...🤣🤣🤣
Best episode yet!
Best guest ever!
Get on the water buffalo 😂😂
The instant regret after tha bomb 🤣🤣😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I was screaming to stop 😂
That was fabulous.
ALL HAIL , Our wish has been granted 😂
What a legend of a guest! Holy smokes.
The only problem I have with Conan is that he's in character ALL the time. I was looking for him to just be a normal guy and give an interview rather than an act. I feel no closer to him than I did before I watched this. That differs from nearly all of the other guests.
Love that he always brings out the Richard Nixon impression no matter what 😂 Conan is the best!
That was the greatest episode ever but holy $%@!, RIP Conan! All that pain for a bit. Conan is the best. 😂
The best episode ever.
He's a maniac!
I hope this was filmed a while ago because I fear Conan may have died in next 24-48hrs after filming and it's just not been made public yet. He died doing what he loved, pandering to fans 50yrs his junior.
I can't wait to hear on his podcast how he felt later that day.
this is the best ep. period
We NEED JORDAN from Conan Show to do Spicy Wings! He is the most interesting man in the world..
His the best!!! 😂 #1 all time 🙊 👏
hot wings legend is conan
That was amazing. Haven't laughed that hard in awhile 😂
Richard Nixon trying to be funny on the talk show, TOOK. ME. OUT!!! definitely top 3 favorite episodes.
Best episode EVER
Pouring the sauce on his hands killed me 😂 I aspire to have his level of heat tolerance 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This was chaotic. I have waited for years to see Conan be on
LITERALLY the only episode I've been excited to click on in the last few years.
Oh my goodness. No comic has ever killed like this.
But, I LOVE HIM MOM!!!! 😩
Well, he's the king. Thanks!
Best. Episode. Ever.
instant classic
Instant goat episode!! Instant goat episode!!! Instant goat episode!!!
Had me laughing out loud throughout the episode😂. Many years in the game and Conan's still doing it big 🤣
The sponsor for this ep was a ~ choice ~ oof.mp3
Easily the largest circumference head ever on the show. I love Conan so I’m so glad to see this. He’s great in the studio, but Conan is a legend of the location spot. I’m for sure going to watch this show.
I've loved Conan since the 1st episode. His energy and ability to tap into pure ridiculous was infectious and gave me material for my class clown antics
I cried with laughter. Conan is a legend.
As unhinged as ever.
April's fool
😂😂😂
I couldn't have clicked on this episode any faster. Two of my favorite talk hosts each showing their expertise. Brilliant!
The one guest I've hoped for since this show started finally makes his appearance. Thank you Sean, crew, and CoCo!
This + Make peace with Jay and silent bob to bring them in - and my wishlist is complete
Conan turned the brightest humiliated shade of red I’ve ever seen 😂
Finally 🎉❤
What a MONSTER.
This is the best episode since Gordon Ramsey. Incredibly fantastic!😂😂😂😂
I genuinely can't think of a better person to be the season finale or even to be on the show in general. Conan O'Brien is a treasure, one of the most legendary tv hosts of all time, amazing amazing show.
Glad his pulse was still there bahaha
BEST. EPISODE.  EVER!
**This doctor is a paid actor and did not go to medical school in 1998**
You might be able to end the show here, that's it, what more could we want??
Well Conan will be winning a lot of the hot ones awards this year
That was magnificent. Chef’s kiss. 😂
conan appears to be white, but he has asian heritage 🤣
I could watch this FOREVER 😂 BEST episode ever ❤❤❤❤
Wow haha😅
Best episode ever.
Conan is the GOAT
Conan O'Brien the new King of Hot Ones😂
His answer to which book should a comedy student read is really saying that you can't teach it. Comedy is a instinct, a personality type. Give that person anything and they'll find humor in it.  HOWEVER, the original question was about a comedy review course, not a how-to comedy course.  Same as a art review course doesn't teach how to be an artist, instead its a survey of art in history.  So Conan's answer was probably the spice affecting his mental status.
I've never seen a guest as eccentric on any show, let alone Hot Ones, as Conan.  Eric Andre's first appearance was the most entertaining episode thus far, but now, we have a new king of eccentricity, let's go team coco!
Bro it’s Conan’s show now
This was fantastic!
Wow, wow, wow… what an absolute legend
Not liking Conan O’Brien might be a sin. Bringing in a real life Dr. Nick from the Simpsons is an all  time bit.
Greatest episode ever
best episode yet❤
Conan's next poopy episode should be on hiis podcast. Now that would be comedy
Best episode of Hot Ones ever!
Now THIS is an excellent guest. So much personality!
best......episode.......ever
Finally we been waiting
Finally, Conan is here🤩🔥🔥
Wow, that is the best one ever! Conan should be a guest host! Hilarious!!!
what a beast <3 connor is the final boss
A minute in and the doctor bit already killed me
Best episode ever. Nothing comes close. What a ride 😂😂😂
@17:43 this was the moment where he had second thoughts about taking a swig out of that bottle LOL
That was everything I hoped it would be lol
I’m in shock 😮what a wild man
Goodness. What a beast - Conan nailed it! Ha!   I also love him questioning why he jumped up on the water buffalo and immediately takes a swig of the worst sauces! Another bad decision to make us laugh!
He is definitely going to regret that in the bathroom later.
That was the most magical thing I've ever watched.
I won't be surprised when they reported him dead the next morning
This, was ridiculous 😂😂😂
Yessss!!!! The episode I’ve been waiting for!!! I love Conan!!!
instant classic
Has anyone checked on Conan since taping? Is he alive?
How it's Haiti, Conan? Great as always? :))
BEST.  ONE.  EVER.
RIP Conan he would've loved this episode 😂
Think we peaked here guys
This is the same guy that gave a commencement speech at Harvard and Dartmouth, a speech at the White House Correspondents, not to mention interviewing US presidents.
❤ this is the best episode imho. The seconf best episode is Noel Gallagher. I pray Sean gets Liam Gallagher next. 😂😂😂😂
This is already gunna be a legendary episode without even watching it
Best guest yet
Thank you, Hot Ones. Thank you
“I have a show, it’s on Max, they used to call it HBO but people found that too popular” 😂😂😂 F’n genius
Teary laughed so hard
Conan!!!
Who knew hot sauce could make you go full Tom Green
Easily on the Mount Rushmore of Episodes!
This is the best one yet!!!!
Best One Yet.  Conan is the man.
Mila Kunis kept her word
Conan is one wild guy 😂.
Conan O’Brien: he came, he saw, he conquered!! The bar has been set 👏 😅
OMFG, instant classic. I don't know how Sean can top this episode. Conan just mic dropped the celebrity side. He poured more sauce, ate nearly the entire wing instead of a nibble, instead of acting like a wimp he went the other way. This should've been held as the episode when Hot Ones ends, or, at least, have Conan back for the very final episode.
Conan metabolized these hot sauces as quickly as he metabolizes medicine 💊💉😂
This rivals Dave Grohl's episode as the best ever!
congrats on the best episode ever
Was just having a conversation at work the other day and a coworker is telling me that redheads have higher pain tolerance level than most people. That’s my reasoning for how he just manhandled the wings and sauces 😂🙂‍↔️
Why didnt you drop this episode on 18th April. Happy birthday in advance Conan🎉
DAYUM FINALLY CONAN!!
Conan CANNOT disappoint, EVER
when i saw that conan was gonna come on, i knew that he would start struggling from the very first wing, but then somehow manage to finish every single wing. the second part was right. i stand corrected. Bro didn't even flinch. that's just how cone dog 69 rolls. respect.
i actually believed that dude was a real doctor initially 😂
Unhinged
LET'S GOOOOOO. GOD I LOVE CONAN
This is the best episode ever (haven’t watched the ep yet)
Smashed the like button before even starting ✌🏽
4:22 "take ownership from that side of the table" That was your own undoing, Sean
was actually worried about him, but omfg he really went for it! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 what an icon! I'm so excited for his new show!! 🙌🏻  also... him ranting while holding onto and waving that bottle of hot sauce around 🤣
I now forgive you for Gwyneth. Conan is the best Hot Ones guest EVAR!!
Conan really channeled his inner Farley by the end there
I would have been disappointed if this was anything less than it was. Conan is god.
*Commitment 101* What an absolute beast! Shia dabbing them all was one thing; Conan _drinking_ the sauces is on a different planet entirely! 😂😂😂😂
The GOAT
Sona needs to do this too! It would be one of the best episodes ever. Letterman too
Conan finally made onto here! A true TV legend
CODYYYYY...love conan...
Conan is a brave man, but that was hideous.   I'm going to have to watch the Sydney Sweeney episode again to cleanse my eyeballs.
The best!!!! Conan you Genius,  you did it again! Laughing to tears
Conan doesn't feel pain - he just gets more Irish!
ICONIC
The amount of times I went "CONAN!!!!!!!!" Like an annoyed parent at their child
YESSSSSS
We love Conan. GOAT.
Dr Arroyo 🤣🤣🤣
Conan is my HERO.. i hope you live long and prosper my legend...
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Who else stopped this video to look up the water buffalo fall 🙋🏻‍♂️
Love Conan, best memories with Norm. Conan is a legend
Jordan Schlansky on Hot Ones is an absolute must
Hey!!!Conan!!!!!😀😀😀
This was both hilarious and disgusting in equal measures
Best episode
Dude is 61 next week, drank hot sauce, taught us about reading high and low, and plugged his new show without a single fumble of words. This is true old school professional
Easily the best episode ever of this show. Hands down.
BEST GUEST EVER HAHAHAHAHA
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
No words necessary❤️😌🙏
Hands-down, the funniest most gangster episode ever!!!!!! Conan he is absolutely savage!!!!😂😂
While I can't help but roll my eyes every time he says he's Irish (along with every Irish person when an American says they're Irish), he saved this season.
"I grew up with tasteless food" DITTO, never looked back!!
Hands down the best episode
So much for Sean always copying how his guests eat.  😂
I have got to get high with Conan
Of course Conan would come on and instantly jump into the top 5 hot ones episodes of all time. I knew it was going to be a wild ride soon as I saw the thumbnail, and he did not disappoint. Legend!
GOAT
Sean quaking at the "Da Bomb" pour is pure gold
I think guest wise this is the most amazing episode ever.
I’ve just watched the best thing ever on the internet.
After a season where most of the time you couldn't even show us the footage of the store eating the chicken because most of them took a bite of Polly pocket all finally what will go down in history as the greatest episode in the history of the show. I will watch this particular episode every single day it's good to see that you can still find someone that enjoys a bit of spice it's a shame you have to show the episodes when they can still meeting chicken because they are incapable of ingesting spice which is fine but in that case they should've never been invited on the show in the first place placeable
GOAT guest, GOAT episode.
Conan is One Of the BEST late night host and entertainer. His dedication to entertainment is PURE MAGIC! I salute you Conan
"Ah...vhat tha fach? Thej onlj haw 1 hot suasc on tha program vhittsch narmalj thej saew as tha last 1, The Last Dab and itt vasn't fachinh juuszd inn thiss eppisseid maekinh thiss program dissabeid ar dissregard itts' teitl, Hot Ones."
Ok, I follow everything Conan's been doing, I've also been watching most Hot Ones eps about since it started. This was absolutely the most UNHINGED/INSANE, UNEXPECTED, NON CONEY-ISH, SEAN BREAKING, BEST EPISODE of this show. I was sitting alone watching this and when he poured the sauce excessively and drank from the bottle I screamed NO NO NO NO so loudly that a neighbour came to check in everything's alright. I love you Conan you magnificent beast.
The freaking goat. Love to love to love him.
Love that subtle jab at Leno (6:25)
Conan is enough guest to compensate for Ice Spice... and to prepay for all bad guests for the remainder of the show's run.  Conan is #1
Conan IS the spice!!!❤
Conan took this interview over 😂
. . . is that hot sauce real?
as incredible of a host as Sean is, he stood absolutely NO chance containing the GOAT. As soon as Conan took the first swig out of the bottle, he was in complete control. This is a masterpiece
Did you guys just killed Conan?
Conan just ended hot ones.
I'm pretty sure that we've reached peak Hot Ones. I'm not sure it'll ever get better than this episode.
Conan > Steve-O
RIP Conan & RIP Sean haha. Good luck following up this episode XD
This solidified that Conan is truly one of the greatest, funniest people to ever have lived.
By far the best guest!!! Wow hats off Mr. O'Brian
Conan 🐐
Him putting the wings in his pocket is weird, you guys think he’s worried they going to clone him? Or could his DNA lead to some skeletons in his closet 🤣🤣🤣
This was legendary
Greatest episode yet
OH MY GOD!!! EPIC CONAN!!!
What did I just watch?!  I can't remember the last time a guest looked to clean the wings, let alone try that madness.  The bar has been set.  Well done Conan!
Im so happy
I feel sorry for anyone who has to go on Hot Ones after Conan because this is the greatest episode I've ever seen. How do you top this?!
He handled them wings better than anybody
I actually laughed ❤ Conan is actually funny 😂
hands down this is the best episode ever
Just incredible
I don't fear you, wing man.
Great episode! Conan is awesome. Dabbing and licking da bomb was 🔥
Didn't think our guy got could get any redder
I don't know a single person who dislikes Conan and that is for good reason! He truly is a national treasure and this episode will go down in Hot-Ones history for sure
SHEER PERFECTION 😂😂😂😂
Conan did not disappoint, best Hot Ones episode ever!! Sean must have been blown away when Conan complimented his interview skills. Bravo, Sean! 🎉🎉💐💐
conan should win an emmy for this. goat behavior!!
A wise and stable man indeed.
This is my favorite episode ever
Well there it is, folks. The greatest hot ones of all time
I've never pressed on a thumbnail faster
I’m SO glad I watched this! Gold!
Conan Mother Fu<king O’Brien ladies and gentleman.
This is the best hot ones ever!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
He's the best kind of silly. i'm a Conan fan. He's like the Stevo of showbizz!
best hot ones I've seen
Conan was by far the funniest guy here, bravo 👏
That was amazing!!!
I am so happy this is here.
He just drank the hot sauce like it was nothing!
"Was it a 4 year medical school?" "It was supposed to be." LOL
Connie's on 🔥
Legendary
Conan has to be the best guest on this show ever! What a way to close out a season!
This is great. FEED IT TO MY VEINSSSSSS
Possibly the best guest yet.
YES FINNALY
Instant classic
The doctor is one of his writers.
wow
the 'red head gene' is STRONG with this one!! absolute BALLER!!
History was made today😂😂😂
Long live Conan the Bragadocius!
Literally the best episode of Hot Ones.
THE FUNNIEST HOT ONES EPISODE EVERRRRRRRR!!!!!! LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL !!!!!
This is one of the greatest and funniest interviews they’ve done. I love it lol
Finally a guest I care about again
I miss the string dance. 😢
“The Charlie Rose show eating hot wings”. Perfect description of HotOnes
The absolute best episode of Hot ones I've ever seen to date! 😂😂😂😂
I wish he brought Jordan Schlansky
Finally someone interesting again. Thought is was going to be those prime drink losers.
It’s the best episode ever
Conan's best bits were always when he would hit the road, so I'm sure this series is going to be straight fire.
LEGEND
Conan: "Why can't I feel"   The King has arrived
OG, true legend
😂😂😂😂😂
Thats maybe the best hot ones ep ever!.. I've been watching since day 1, i should know! 🤌🏼  Perfect hahaha
5:45 Conan was so quick on that one 😂
Greatest hot ones ever.
Conan is crazy AF!!
Best Hot Ones episode ever. Period.
Conan’s the best .
Legend!!!!!
This was awesome. I needed this laugh after a tough week of Life.
That man is so funny. wow, it gets really gross at the end.
cool conan
This may go down as the best interview, not just hot ones, but of all time
This is the best Hot Ones to date and it's not even close
gosh, this was a hilarious trip. loved every bit.
Jordan Schlansky would just stare the whole time…in various ways.
Aside from being a comedy juggernaut, you can tell Conan is a super class act who doesn't hesitate from expressing his appreciation for people's work. He did that for Jimmy Fallon recently when he went on to promote the new show, and he did it here for Sean too.
Craig Ferguson on would also be awesome :) Great show as always :)
just straight gasping this whole video 😭😭 he went CRAY
Conan O’Brien, the best guest ever by far.
I love this!!!  We NEED LETTERMAN!! Much love to the team, great content as usual.
So many seasons in you couln't think there would be a better guest and then there's Conan dabbing da bomb and rubbing sauce on his chest 🤣🤣
Wow wow wow
greatest hot ones episode of all time.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan has always struck me as someone who would be really cool to work for.
Coco is crazy 😂
Holy sheet Conan is a spice lord.
I remember the water buffalo story from when it happened and Conan showing his huge bruise to the audience. I have no idea how he didn’t get hurt even worse from that.
Tell Conan I'll subscribe to Max to watch his show just because of his bravery in this interview! 😂😂😂
What an absolute mad man
Best episode EVER!!! Conan is the king of late night (after Carson) but he is definitely now the king of Hot Ones!!
Conan is a BEAST!!!!
GREATEST EPISODE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! Conan, you're a monster!
Oh my god is Conan the best guest ever?! This was the hardest I have ever laughed at this show he was WILD 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Incredible
This is the best one, Conan is just GOAT
My man is looking more and more like Cheeto Jesus as he ages. I'm glad he's leaning into it.
This is going to be my fav episode
This is just pure chaos with the wings😂
That water buffalo story has got to be the funniest thing I've heard in a long time!!! 😂
The. Absolute. Best. Episode. Ever.
I came here and expected peak Hot Ones, but I got so much more. Easily top 5 material.
That...  was unhinged.
Coco is a Legend in his commitment. He is so high right now
Retire the show on this episode.. No one will ever top this interview.
This has easily been the best episode yet ha!
20:56 peak hot ones reaction this season
He KILLED IT.  More than Steve-O.  I'm surprised and impressed!
Conan's energy and comedy is just timeless. I have been a GIANT fan of Hot Ones and Conan for eons and being able to witness this is blessing. A little bit of internet to reinvigorate my soul. Credit to Sean and the Hot Ones staff and thanks for making my day a lot brighter! Excelsior!!!!
Best episode ever..wow!!!
this episode exceeded my expectations. Freaking love conan. Best night show host ever😁
Yayyyyy love me some Conan
Conan on hot ones is an insta click from me
Best host ever
THE LEGEND!!
Best episode ever.
Conan is on FIRE!!!!!
Conan is a maniac in the greatest sense 🤣🤣🤣
THAT was the most insane episode of Hot-Ones I've EVER SEEN... P.S (Would love to know what the AFTERMATH was!)
Hands down this is the Greatest episode.. Conan committed and brought his A game. Only wished Sean would have asked about Jordan shlansky 😂
Hall of Fame episode
This is basically the greatest thing I've ever seen!
Dream come true... and it was better than anyone could ever imagine... GOAT guest!!! Hope he is okay.... What a fkin legend Conan!
Conan wasn’t funny tbqh honest
Conan is a LEGEND!
Yes dude a new clueless gamer
Move over Gordon Ramsay, there’s a new sheriff in town.
First time I’ve ever set an alarm for a Hot Ones episode
Best episode I've ever watched and I've watched 95% of them. 😂😂😂😂😂
Easily one of the best ones ever to do it. Absolute legend amongst men. Conan is such a joy to be around it seems, and so highly intelligent.
Best episode to date
Top 10 episode here?
Wonder if he thought Conan wrote the mediocre presidents song on the Simpsons?
I grew up in the 90s watching Conan Obrien. I wouldn't expect anything else from him.
That's the best episode ever! 😂😂😂
Careful around the eyes Conan.
What an episode!!! Top 5 guest in my opinion
Ice spice take notes this is how you do an interview
This is absolutely amazing. This is the resurgence guest Hot Ones needed.
best episode ever
Easily in the top 10 episodes ever
the real life doctor nick
😂😂😂 one of the best I have seen well done!
Conan: "I dont think there is a wing here that I cannot eat like an ice cream!" Da'Bomb Beyond Insanity: "Hold my Capsaicin"
GENIUS!
How can anything possibly top this episode?  Conan O’Brien was already the GOAT but he’s cemented himself as the absolute greatest with this one.
Beautiful chaos. Jesus I'm so happy. 😂😂😂😂 it was like 1999 Conan came out to play ❤❤
This was most definitely the season finale! By far the most entertaining guest and so hilarious!! LOVE Conan!!!!
No one will ever Beat Conan O'Brien on hot ones. The man is a legend or he's nuts 🤣🤣
WHAT AN ANIMAL! CONAN IS THE GOAT!
13:29 THIS IS F**KING PEAK!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Best episode ever.
This is the first time i've seen Sean actively concerned =))
Conan is a madman, always committed to the comedy.
awesome, conan is GOAT
Best hot ones ever!!!!!
By far the best episode. Hands down no contest.
TEAM COCO!!!!!!!!!!!
Coco is my favorite.
This is why he is the goat of late shows.  Man is a maniac!
An interviewer getting interviewed by an interviewer.
that dr arroyo bit was insane 😂😂😂 and just the right amount of perverse, like Conan is
I'm in pain just watching what Conan did! 😂😂😂😂😂
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
I can't wait to hear him talk about this after!!  My stomach hurts watching this.
Finally a good one
Conan always acts OTT, it's like he's trying too hard. Okay he's not like Jimmy Fallon but he always goes over the top, a bit like Robin Williams. I saw his interview with Oxford Union and it was cringe to watch. I guess it makes entertainment for some people
This has to be one of the best episodes ever! Definitely one for the books 😄
What an absolute legend.
Man ! he went for it.
Sean, I have never commented on a YouTube video, but this was hands down the funniest show I have seen in ages! Kudos to Conan and you guys for just letting him go and be himself. Oh my I am still laughing 🤣 I may pass out hahahaha 😅😂
Conan is, in fact, a barbarian. What a beast 😂
The secret is coco can disassociate with his show biz chops
Greatest episode ever
This makes up for that Ice Spice one.
Absolutely hilarious.
No one will top that. Ever. Incredible.
🤣🤣
And here is our next top tier meme 23:01
God I am *CRY* laughing, Conan is a f*cking _legend_
Conan is the absolute goat.
This might be the best Hot One's episode ever
Only guest to dominate the wings
This is without a doubt the greatest interview/experience I have ever witnessed. It will go down in history.
This was crazzyyyyy good!
"What's wrong with me? Why can't i feel?"
2:30 in and this is already the most unhinged interview in the history of this show
Notice he referred to Leno as "the other guy." He said Letterman and "the other guy"
Bro we need the after math when the cameras shut off cuz I have had some of these and he is hurting man
My God, I never realized that Conan could do a Donald parody so well !!
Def one of the best episodes
my head hurts. this is peak!
The Pride of Brookline
I feel like Conan went full Chris Farley on this, and it was perfect in every way
He should've brought Jordan Schlansky
Sean, no one will ever top this!!! Shut it down now!!! I'm crying over here!!! Roflmfao!!!!😂😂😂😂😂
Anyone know when Conan is scheduled to be on Hot Ones again?! It's been too long already.
I didn't think anyone would beat Gordon Ramsay. I was wrong. Conan is an absolute MANIAC!
I knew I loved Conan, but this really just sent my love over the top 😂😂❤
HE HAD TO HAVE S U F F E R D for doing that... from the sixth one on... completely disrespected the sauces...and maintaining his responses without cracking.... legendary 🤯
They had to doctor those hot sauces. There's just no way
LEGENDARY Performance Sir
Genuinely can't remember the last time I laughed this hard
Congrats on the best episode in HotOnes history 😂😂😂😂
I have waited my entire 24 year old life for this now i can die in peace
Conan is just on another level, what a legend
Somehow better than I thought it would be
Some guests bring a lifeline for the wings. Conan brings a doctor as a comedy prop lol.
This is goated. Maybe new best of all time
Conan! Man is still Legend!
Wow!!!! Conan!!!! Next Conan goes to his doctor. He puts his feet into the stiruppppp Oh well this was the besty show.
Legendary! Great COCO experience.
holy god lol I'm reminded of Conan mentioning on the podcast that he's capable of basically anything in the name of comedy even if it's stuff he'd normally never do... this episode is an example of that in spades haha jesus man. one of the greatest for sure
Absolute GOLD for every one of the 27 minutes!
Conan is a God
HoF Guest!
This is the greatest Hot Ones episode EVER!!
Was Conan like puking?!?! 😂😂
And Conan was never seen again ………….😂❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Pouring Da Bomb on the wing is the equivalent of sitting on a water buffalo.
LEGENDARY
I love Conan pretending like he is going to take a baby dab of the last dab before aggressively pouring it
maybe the best episode to date, rofl.
The doctor checking for the pulse “is there” 😂😂😂😂
Best guest to date! 🤘🤘
BEST SHOW EVER
Easily the best episode yet.
Legend
Well folks, we've reached the top of the mountain. Nobody will ever top this.
Pocketing the wings had me laughing 😂 the last 4 wings were pure chaos. Great episode !
What a finale!! 🤣 @23:00, Sean starts laughing and Conan says "I'M FINE!"
Anyone was in anticipation on Conan v The Bomb 💣
That was wild! 😂 I've been watching for a few years and that was the best!!!
Watching this made me sweat.
Oh my God Conan plus spice equals Catholic disaster.
Dude by the end Conan is just pure unhinged chaos. The guy is fkin legendary. The greatest there's ever been
Conan is my comedy idol and I honestly think in terms of talk show hosts that are in the top ranks, no host will ever be able to top him from here on out, once in a lifetime legend fr
ok, i have to give it up, best interview ever to date.  No others touch this one.  Gg mr Conan O'Brien
Bravo
hands down best talk show host ever
- I ask in good faith: how good are you around hot sauce before we get started?  - I grew up in an Irish House, an Irish Catholic Home in Boston. I never saw a Spice until I was 52 years old.   This was EPIC.  Muchas Gracias Señor Conando Obregón.
Man is instantly a hot ones legend
Dr. Arroyo 😂😂😂
I’ve been on a Conan binge and this completes the journey. Thank you! 🙏🏼
"I yam what I yam."  I cracked so hard hearing that 🤣
You've had a lot of great guests and great shows over the years. So much so that you've grown your whole brand, 13.3 million subscribers, merch, a cult following, all deserved because you're show has been really great.  But this episode right here is the greatest one you've ever done, and i'm saying that without even finishing it yet. Conan is, was, and always will be the GOAT.
Incredible!
Best. Episode. Ever.  Conan is amazing!
Yo Conan is a savage
Legend !,!,!,!,
Conan is a comedy legend! He did not disappoint that was great!!!
i’ve always wanted the intro slogan to be “with hot questions, hotter wings, and the hottest guests”
This is one of the greatest things I’ve ever watched lol
Wooooo9
Perfection
I'm not sure what I just watched. Can we get an episode of Conan interviewing Ice Spice over hot wings?
Conan just gave us an absolute Master Class in improve and comedic professionalism. No victims, no low blows, 4th wall breaks, respecting Sean in the middle of chaos, answering every questions thoroughly. Complete control.
🤣🤣🤣🤣Conan is an absolute lunatic.
In my office on lunch watching this. Crying laughing at the da bomb reaction. Legit got tears. My coworkers must think I'm crazy.
That was a truly epic feat! Conan O'Brien, sir, way to set the bar!
I started drinking milk about halfway through and almost spit it out at the end 😭 I need a breath after that
Top 3 hot ones ever easily
After drinking that sauce, he's only got about 4 years left.
I LOVE CONAN!!!
This has to be the last episode of this show
on the Los Calientas Verde, is red verde is Spanish for green?
Conan is on another level, and please don't ever let me get to that level. The dude needs ritalin or something.
can this intensity be topped?
The GOAT
That was either the most inspiring or unhinged ending, I’m not sure.
Who’s he gonna give those wings too after?? lol Jordan I hope
My Like before watching
This is seriously the best episode that has ever been made.
I love me some conan
I just gotta say it....I think this is the BEST ONE YET!!😂😂 More views than Gordon Ramsey
16:40 I’m convinced Coco has the orange cat chromosome 😂
Legendary!!
Instant classic Hot Ones episode
The wings pocket though....Conan is an absolute legend
Literally nothing bad can be said about conan. He is the goat.
Love the philosophy of being a talk show guest from Conan
Conan is just the best
Funny how some of them want a lot of distance...
how can you not LOVE Conan
an absolute riot,  I love Conan!
Oh my goodness I was cackling at this episode. Gold all the way through!
Wow! What an episode. It was every bit what I would expect and more from Conan
Absolutely legendary episode from a legendary guest
Conan is an absolute legend, nobody on this planet is as effortlessly funny
Conan just showed up and took over the show lol incredible!
This is going right next to Paul Rudd episode!! what a legend - messing with Da Bomb like this is another level of flexing!!
watching sean just enjoy Conan at the end was priceless.  I have never laughed out loud at this show before like this.
Unhinged Conan is the best Conan 😂
Epic
The doctor was incredible lol
Best episode by far.
this could be historic!  I love this man
This is probably the most ridiculous I’ve ever seen Conan and that’s truly saying something given his history.
This has been the craziest to date for suuuuuuure!
An absolute animal
HOLY FQ!!! Amazing!! How was he after?
This feels more like a Conan segment than a Hot One’s one.
This couldn’t had been real-that would hospitalize someone
Conan W! Love that guy
Oh my god !!!!!
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!!!!
Quite possibly the greatest episode of Hot Ones
Steve-O thought he was hard when he put the hot sauce in his eye, but this... this was something else.
I've been suggesting Conan for ages and seeing this now makes me so happy
That vocal sound effect from Conan! Lol! 👍🏿 Remember the "Conan" remote he had with Deon Cole at the soul food restaurant, and he poured gravy on his food. He used the same vocal impression.
This is the most unhinged Hot Ones I've ever seen and I am totally here for it.
So it’s official…there is no point in watching another episode. Conan killed this in every way 😂❤
Wait... wasn't Conan on the writing staff on the Simpsons when Homer put wax in his mouth to eat the spicy pepper? Is this the ultimate throwback bit?
What a legend 😂😂😂😂. He took on the wings of death like a champ.
Wow!!!!!  He’s the toughest person ever to do this show.   Wow!!!!
Best episode of life right here. Can't stop belly laughing
this is like rawdogging a total solar eclipse, so majestic and traumatic
19:29 My first thought: Harding. Then Conan says Harding. What is it about that guy?
Conan is eternally the GOAT.
Never clicked faster on a Hot Ones episode
Never watched this show until now. Fantastic.
I swear anything with Conan turns into pure comedy gold.
Fantastic chaos
I’ve never really watched any of Conan‘s material, but seeing him put the wings in his pocket did it for me.
My new favorite episode. Love it.
Absolutely crazy. I love this.
He is doing great one of the best yet have got to like and respect him ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
I died with how cartoonishly post-disaster Conan looked during his “there’s funny everywhere” speech 😂
That was THE funniest episode ever. I was crying for most of it 😂 Love Conan
Can we have Emmy from YouTube channel Emmymade? She talks about how she likes spice and grew up on sriracha. Maybe also Max Miller or Babish?
Yes oh my god
This might be the goat episode. Had me laughing the whole time.  Internet gold.
There will never be a better episode.
This interview is absolutely amazing
This really devolved into a Filthy Frank video near the halfway mark
Wow!!!! ❤
Conan is the 2# greatest of all time!
i was not really familiar with Conans game... mad respect
I feel like the spice is just feeding his energy therefore making him stronger
Favorite episode yet! Conan you absolute madman!
I loved every part of this interview. I have always been a fan of Conan, and this interview proves he is a great comedian that's dedicated to his craft. I'm getting MAX just to watch his show!
It's just Max in the US.  It's still HBO Max everywhere else.
Id love it if Sona was on also
Easily my favorite interview, Conan is ALWAYS on. Could not quit laughing during this one.  The joke at the end “I love how you ruined me but saved your suede jacket” friggin got me 😂
I love Hot ones, but can we remove the two tables and bring it to one? I miss the intimate moments with guests
That was just pure insanity, loved every second of it
Da Bomb never disappoints hahahaha
By far the best episode. The fact that Conan also tanked the hot sauces- the pinnacle of Hot Ones right here.
Sean Evans disbelief as Conan lick the wings with Da Bomb sauce got me dead 💀💀 we all knew Conan was gonna regret that decision lol
This was absolute GOLD.   We got to see so many sides of Conan. I loved every moment of this.   Perfect finale episode.
I really wish there's Sona laughter in the background.
Finally a guest I know and love. And what a legend Conan is.
Man... this is one of the top 3 best ones... I love it
Whats wrong with me? Why cant I feel?!!!
Best episode ever!
Conan is the goat. this was so funny!
I have been watching this show for years now, but the crown goes to Conan. I knew he won’t disappoint us he is just amazing 😂🎉
What a Madman! 😂
Oh my god.. 😂
Hands down the best episode. Will be hard to top this one. It's an experience.
They cant top this.  I mean conan is typically unhinged, but this decent into maddness triumph even his appearance in Murderville. 😂😂
I thought shakira was the last one to close out... hmm.
Masterclass
Absolutely hilarious! One of the best interviews to date!!
I didn't think I could love and respect Conan more. I was INCORRECT
That was awesome!
bro these are literally my two favorite white people ever
Easily the best episode to date! Conan disrespected the Da Bomb, took a swig of the Last Dab, and still remembered the plug. He's a legend!
im actually got scared watching this one lol
Legendary interview.
RYAN REYNOLDS FREAKING PLEEEAAASSEEEEE! He's so interesting, especially as a businessman.
He came ready to play. He just walked in, dropped his pants and leroy jenkins'd right through the wings like a warrior.
This is the footage they need to use to shame anyone who quits before the end.
"Therr issz comedj inn that emmberressinh widdjo thej maed aw that Testament ballad."*
I love how he forgot about the plug and just went feral until Sean brought him back to the capitalist reality.
THAT'S WHAT I CALL ENTERTAINMENT ! ❤😂
this was so chaotic
Conan is a comedic treasure.  Great finale.
Oh Conan, we love you! 😂🍗 🔥 ❤
This was the best part of my day.
4:43 Torille!
YES
Halley Berry is the superstar of females, but Conan is the total champion...He needs a trophy.
Did Conan just opened the last sauce, poured it all over his wing and then took a sip directly right from the mouth of the devil? This man is dead inside he fears nothing
conaaaaaaaaannnn!!!!!
Sean looked genuinely scared on this one. what a season closer.
Conan being ridiculously silly to the musical backdrop of an epic fantasy final battle killed me. Everything about this was the best and everything I'd hoped for.
Listen death is at the front of my mind almost constantly and if there's one thing i can be grateful for after being hurled onto this planet against my will its that I got to grow up with the comedy of Conan O'Brien.
Two amazing conversationalists having a conversation.
Cry laughing 😂
I think they need to end the show here. No way they top this!!
Reminds me that Che, fellow SNL alumunus, also did the whole "the wings aren't hot" bit.  That being said, I think Conan might be the only guest who ever at least said that none of the wings were hot at any point in the show.
Of all the guest on this show, I think is one of the last people I would expect to handle the wings so well.
I laughed, cried, got schooled, and almost puked! Best episode, hands down.
13:33 is cracking me up
That was quite possibly the best episode yet. I had a visceral reaction when Conan started chugging Da Bomb!
I am at work and I am DYING!!! 😜
This one’s gonna go down in the history books 😂
Greatest episode of Hot Ones ever
I felt this.
did he switch out the sauces?!!
Best episode ever.
Pure raw comedy. Hands down the funniest guest yet on Hot Ones! Not even close
One sec wt happend to Jordan?
Conan better put every wing on his pocket
Awesome!!!
I wonder if even Sean was prepared for the chaos that is Conan
This is the best thing ever 😂 I watched him growing up and he's still the king
Absolute gold this episode definitely rewatchable
Legendary.
Conan killed it!
30k views, 15k likes after little over an hour, this guy is putting up legendary numbers because he is indeed legend.
I want to know how badly he was in pain in real life.
It’s finally happening. Every episode someone asks for Conan haha
I literally thought he was eating fake hot sauce
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣The best!!
GOAT
What a crazy episode so great
"close out seasont 23" yo y'all lied to shakira
What a LEGEND. Truly the best to ever do it.
I want to see Jordan Schlanski eat Da Bomb😂
This might be the best episode… ever?
The shot of Da Bomb bottle leaking out at the end has me DEAD
Jesus Efing Christ... Conan did not disappoint... Sean on the other hand... First time I saw terror in his eyes...
Wow! So nice they’re having celebrities on the show again 😂I haven’t seen any since Steve-O…
I think this tops Gordon Ramsey
Conan became the chaotic good Joker at the end.
He brought Dr. Nick to the show hahaha
Wow, a true entertainer.
This is the most entertaining hot ones ever! 😅
Shoutout doctor arroyo
You can only connect the dots looking back, never looking forward.
Ok a legit laugh out loud episode. Way to end another great season. Already looking forward to the next one.
This is the best Hot Ones EVER!
Am I the only one that there’s a relation to Max Weinberg?
Dr Arroyo is one of Conan's longtime writers lol
I just had a dream about Conan O’Brien last night. Had no idea he was gunna be on this. It’s freaking me out
That was great
This is the best episode on Hot Ones !! So much laughter, joy and pure happines .... Conan is a comedy genius !
Conan should join the Grand tour show, he whould fit perfectly
Conan’s commitment to the bit is impressive with the pain I know he’s experiencing based on that sheen of sweat on his face
I never laughed as much as I did with this one. God, Conan, what a human.
This is the best most unhinged hot ones I've ever seen! Conan and Sean are the best!
17:56 Nixon impression incoming! 😂
Epic!! Best one so far
Wings in his pocket😂 Conan rocks ♾️
The best episode period.
The best episode ever!!!
Conan O'Brien, from now on the Defeater of every hot Sauce.
Great Hot ones, love the guest and his humour! I wish for Arnold Schwarzenegger on Hot ones... Watching from Slovenia ☺️🖖
Best episode of all time
He will regret that.
Best episode by a country mile.
Easily my new favorite episode.
The ending!! i'm crying laughing!!!
OK… DaBOMB Ice Cream For YOU!!! Giant ManPerson. LFG💪💥💥💥😘
Da Bomb just pouring out its own tears in defeat is cinematic gold.
Conan is effortlessly funny 😁
Finally something to watch!!! I’ve had nothing to watch all week!!!
All I can say is...this is legendary. Conan is the GOAT and I am so happy you guys were able to get him in the show.
lol this was both hilarious and disgusting.
Conan❤❤❤❤  We are waiting for your show far toooooo long! We are excited to see you on tv again !!!!
Man, how great is Conan? This was honestly peak Hot Ones. The best episode I have ever seen. I have never seen Sean so scared yet so excited during an interview. I doubt any other guest can beat this episode.
lol what a legend! Conan went all out and this was so good.
Unhinged! Absolutely unhinged!
Easily the best episode of hot ones , Conan is a legend
what a finale
That escalated quickly! He turned into Joker towards the end with that hot sauce smile around his mouth and ranting. If I did that with Da-Bomb, I imagine I'd be already on the way to the hospital with the sound of the ambulance guys saying "We're losing him!" so he was taking it pretty well, better than I expected.
Clicked it immediately bcuz its conan.
That was unbelievable
Team Coco!!!!!!! F**K Leno!!!!!!!!!!!
Umm is this the real Joker?
This was THE episode I was waiting for!
this is something else
Conan is insane and I love it!!!🔥🔥🔥
Sean just became one of the big ones with Conan hyping him up
A thing of sheer beauty with hyper-pointed notes of brilliance and insanity!!!*~☆  Loved this Hot-Ones team, keep up the great wurk and thank you!*~☆♡  🌋~*☄️🖤🔥🥛🌶🥵🍗🪽🔥💣💥🥵🔥🧡*~🌋
😳🫢🫣🤣🤣🤣 best episode ever!!!! I was skeptical with the baby nibbles in the beginning, but wow! Class act!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan is deliberately not leaving any DNA behind. Hmm, can we get a cross reference of the unsolved crimes that occurred while Conan was traveling all around the world for his fancy pants travel show?!?!
Best guest on this show HANDS DOWN. The way he demolished those sauces with zero remorse will never be topped. What a G
Im pretty sure conan coated his mouth with candle wax to not taste these wings
Conan is the absolute best.
🔥
The absolute GOAT, I was worry about his health for a second not gonna lie!
Finally after the last spree a good guest
Conan the wing O'Barbarian!!!
5:42 LOL
He basically had that shady doctor from The Simpsons 😆
17:01 I’ve always loved this show and I have favorites but omfg I have never NEVER laughed this hard 😂 goated ep this season possibly ever.
I’m shaken
I found this funny
I didn't learn anything new, but I did laugh
I love how his face turns cartoon red and is clearly betraying every word of increasing nonsense spewing from his month. God bless Conan O'Brien and hot ones!
Easily the funniest and most entertaining episode of this show and probably the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. Laughing in hysterics the entire time!
Conan may be the worst guest in a while... trying too hard to be funny... interrupting Sean...
I havnt had somebody in a while who I was so excited to watch. Not shots against hot ones, I just personally love Conan!!
Theeeeeeeeeeee best!!!
I've never seen uncensored Conan before, and I have to say... He should have been unleashed years ago. Very fun season finalé 😂 🌶️
A great host, having the greatest host of all time.  Finally some good content
conan is absolute diamond. never will there be another like him. my fav late night host and comedy personality of all time
Best guest from any episode. Conan is the best.
"What's funnier than Don Quixote?"
Conan as an interviewee = Conan as an interviewer. Same energy, same vibes.. just pure humour
Ok so what’s going to be the meme from this one?
Conan I want to compete with you in hot ones. Bring it on!
The most unhinged Hot Ones ever, including Maya Rudolph's fake one.
I love when he was talking about the in between commercials he said Letterman and the other guy lol
How does one top this appearance?!?! Conan just crushed it here, I was laughing so hard throughout.
Conan gave it all!  Best episode of Hot Ones ever!
best one yet
Oh my god this was so off the rails truly this is peak life experience 😂
Thank you Hot Ones. We Stan Conan 😁
How the heck did he do that? MAX committing to the bit! Three cheers!
This video has to top Gorden Ramsey's interview
When is Howard Stern coming on?
Best episode of the show by far
it’s like he all the lack of energy in the ice spice episode and added it to his own to make the greatest hot ones episode of all time
Team Coco all the way
I forget that Conan is a Harvard grad and then he pulls out the Warren G. Harding quip
This is the wildest episode of hot wings I've ever seen!!! Woah!
We better be getting Ryan Reynolds on this before DeadPool 3, or help me God…
Conan is a legend. This was a great show!
lol this was crazy, he is the best
I should have expected pure chaos with Conan. This was a great episode.
I hope Sean gets to go on Conan Needs A Friend next.
Conan is one of this generations funniest people. I adore him
THAT'S WHY HE'S THE GOAT! THEEE GOOOOAAAT!!!!!
This episode, beyond the shadow of a doubt, is the greatest thing I've ever seen on YouTube. Probably on all of media.
you gotta love conan
Yo conan let's go
6:22 another le epic Conan own, add it to the compilation boys 😎👍🏻
Finally someone I can recognize. XD Love Conan!
Conan is like 10 stories taller than Sean...and no one is talking about that?
23:00 - 23:05 life status clip ready for TikTok & IG stories
Hahaha one of the greats. I have never seen anybody do that. Hahaha Pure Showmanship. Thank you sirs
I love how he gets more mentally deranged as the wings get spicier 😂 He was losing all sense of reason
Incredible. Conan doing what no guest has ever done. Why though, did they not show Sean matching the crazy sauce antics
Best episode ever! HAHAHA! Conan is hillarious!
this one was really good.... doctor bit was great LOL
How was this only 27 minutes long? I can only imagine all the footage they cut
Can't tell if Conan has a high tolerance or an idiot.
THIS WAS THE GREATEST EPISODE of this Show.PERIOD
One of the best episodes ever
He turned into Master Shake. Iconic
This man is one of the legends of comedy. He has and IS still on top of his craft. Amazing performance
Most powerful guest ever
His 100% commitment to the bit is astounding.
That ending was epic.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
This was the best episode so far for sure
Jesus Christ Conan, lol
Conan in the real world is comedy gold,  his remotes are always the best
im sorry but this is very 🤢🤮
This man disrespected the whole shtick yet delivered it in its purest intentional cringe form.
Conan was hysterically funny 30 years ago, and clearly still has it. They way he naturally adjusts to situations without any self-consciousness is what sets him apart. Looking forward to the "HBO" show!
Conan will forever be the Gen X king of late night.
beautiful interview. This interview is the equivalent of Conan getting on top of the water buffalo. My brother has never learned in his entire showbiz journey.
the only way this could have been better was if sona was next to him with her own wings
This my new favorite episode. For god sakes this man graduated from Harvard. I love it 🤣
Glad to hear Conan and the Water Buffalo are on good terms now :) Peace is always an option
Conan on Hot Ones and The Tonight Show in the same week? Sign me up
Literally the best episode ever. Conan is the best!!
Conan channeling Chris Farley.
This was everything I expected and wanted
Conan is the best. Thank you!
I went from terrified of how long he can keep up the bit to endlessly impressed by the time he's licking Da Bomb off the wing. If unhinged insanity can phase into wide-eyed admiration, Conan is one of the few people to warrant it.
Seeing two of my favourite interviewers of all time together was epic! I've never cried of laughter the way I did watching this finale!
not even halfway through yet and this one might be my favorite hahah
great episode!
AAAHAHAHAHAHHAA
This makes up for the Ice Spice one lol Conan is the only spicy redhead for me
Ok Conan you win
"WHY CAN'T I FEEL!?!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan is a certifiable mad man, lol.  If he wasn't wheeled out of there on a gurney I'd amazed......not because of the hot sauce, just because he's an insane lunatic.
This man needs to be the new number 1 in the hot ones rankings
ALL HAIL THE KING! That was epic.
best episode yet
In this day and age with the current state of entertainment how it is with the take over of social media and streaming platforms, it's pretty safe to say that Conan O'Brian is one of the last few living true showman to still be performing at his best.
This was the best episode yet
LOL easily one of the best episodes ever 😅
*Funniest episode ever*
Man really started drinking the hot sauce😂
lets goo camera guy Bill !!!
Best episode ever. Conan is so funny Sean didn’t even need to get through all his questions.
The only thing stronger than irish aversion to spice is their adherence to SPITE
We might have a new Hot Ones G.O.A.T. on our hands here folks!!
Truly the Most of All Time
"I have a SHOW. It's on MAX. They used to call it HBO but people found that too POPULAR. So now it's MAX."
TOP 5!! CONAN SAPEEE!!
love how he's prepared to make this funny
WHIOA! HE DABBED THE BOMB!!! HES DEFINITELY MY HERO NOW!!!!!
This is now the show to beat…what a force of nature…
Conan is the 🐐
"I'm an irish man who's never seen spice"  proceeds to give the most impressive peformance ever, bathing his wing in more "da bomb" while giving the most chill reaction ever. madness
JAY LENO......DAVE LETTERMAN  let's see them too
GOAT late night host and it isn't close
OMFG I've been waiting for this one for so long!
23:50 Conan having mental breakdown 😂😂😂
I haven't laughed this hard at a Hot Ones episode ever! The "medical staff" on hand, the guzzling of hot sauce straight from the bottle, the pure unhinged mania that Conan brings, along with that underlying sincerity and earnestness he brings to his conversations, this has got to be a top tier level interview for this show. It's now up there for me with Gordon Ramsay, Dave Grohl, Paul Rudd, Aubrey Plaza, and Halle Berry. I needed this today, so thank you First We Feast and Sean. This was just marvelous madness!
Hahahahahahaha Conan went literally insane
I think washing his hands in hot sauce and licking it was the wildest thing anyone has ever done on this show. Conan is truly a legend
Conan!!!!
Best. Episode. Ever!!
Conan doesn’t “commit to the bit,” this man loves adrenaline rushes!
No one had to tell Conan to hop on the water buffalo
Wow Conan is the epitome of the class clown past his prime. Watching this has definitively made me decide to never watch his show. He’s just annoying.
Why tf is he putting the wings in his pocket😂 I love Conan
What an absolute madman
no way!! i love conan. so hyped for this episode
Conan is the goat.
It is both wild and awesome that hot ones has taken off the way it has.  Conan is such an awesome guy to see in this light.
Two of the best interviewers sitting down together, this is gonna be one of the great hot ones episodes.
Best. Ever.
wing drop was iconic ngl
Conan cannot be contained. He can only be unleashed.
24:30 High Praise. You're a Great Mother F'n Host!
This is the GOAT episode!
Wrap up all interview shows, we've peaked and it's all downhill from here.
I loved every moment of this
Bring Rodney Mullen IN!
That was an amazing episode. literally the First time I have really laughed in a long time.
I love this guy so much !
20:52 this is the best hot ones episode ever made
its finally happened!!! so happy to see Coco on Hot Ones! 😭
This was just pure chaos, and I loved it!!
Bravo.
I miss the Conan show, it was one of the few late night show that didn't drown you with politics .And it was funny
Conan brought Hot Ones back from the edge of irrelevance
i felt this in my gut....
- You're not a doctor, are you - I should be
Yo!!!!!! Thank you
Conan HAD to have been hurting for the next month or so! Out of his mind, lol!!!
coco the goat
This will never be topped. Utterly legendary.
It's been a minute, and I already liked the video, premature excitement
Funniest interview I've ever seeing 😂😂
I coudn't really tell, but did Sean match Conan's insane actions like pouring Da Bomb all over the wing before eating it?  Cause if so, we gotta give Sean his props too.  I literally was gagging and yelling at my phone not to do it at the same time
Mad respect to Conan! 😂😂😂 Great finale!!! 😁
Just incredible performance from Conan.
That was absolutely insane. For Conan to give Sean props on being an interviewer is just insane compliments. I can't even
20:50 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely love this show and never miss an episode, having said that... This was the best episode I've seen! Conan is always hilarious!🙌
TMI Conan !!! mad props that was one of the best episodes
Best.  Interview.  Ever.
It's blasphemy putting Ice Spice in the same season as King Conan.  This is redemption at it's finest
Call Brett Baker, new king in town
This is the funniest thing I've seen in long long time. 🤣 bravo!!!
Conan went to Harvard
Gods! How I wish Conan & Eric Andre would do skits together!
Best. Episode. Ever.
Always thought he was avoiding this show because he knew his Irish tongue couldn't handle the heat. Even when I realised he was on I thought yeah he's gonna cry after the first wing. Everything that happened after that completely blew me away, what a madman 🤣 loved it
NOW THATS A REAL MAN!!!
28K views and 14K likes. This right here is history.
Is this the best episode of hot ones? Yes, I would say it is.
4:03 *Tame Impala rift starts playing*
The stethoscope on the tongue  😂
What a brilliant way to end the season- Classic Conan-Yesssssss
Conan is my father
I swear, I really thought about FWF inviting Conan O'Brien to the hot ones video before this came out! Speaking of the angel!
YEEEEES
This was wonderful! Thank you Hot Ones and Conan for this piece of perfect in the universe.
This man is a MENACE!!!!!!
I can now die in peace.
Sean didn't match his guest with the wings and sauce!  After all these seasons Conan is the goat!
Epic
Really love how Conan overprepares for this, unrestrained energy. Such a chaotic show 🤣
I mean... just throw out the formula with Conan! I've not laughed so hard.
Definitely 9ne of the ALL TIME BEST Hot Ones. Spectacular 🤣🤣
This is my favorite episode now 🤣
The ending had season finale Rick Sanchez vibes. Conan is so underrated
THAT WAS AN EXPERIENCE... HAHAHAHA
this was the most unhinged episode i’ve ever seen. mad respect to conan
This one was so good!
Still a better Doctor than Oz
BEST. EPISODE. EVER!!!
Sean has a lot of fun but you can tell this is the interview/episode of his career.  Conan Wild n Out! lol
That was the greatest display of hot chicken wing consumption I have ever witnessed.
Honestly if this was the very last Hot Ones ever it would be the perfect ending.
Insane
Thank you Mila Kunis for this.
"Whats wrong with me?! Why can't I FEEL?!"
He's still got it!  😅
That was the best episode for a while! That was amazing!!!
I love that Conan felt Da Bomb so much he just lost his marbles  Actually, not only that, let’s talk about how Conan is typically seen as a very classy guy, he’s energetic and has a wild side. He certainly seems to live up to that as well, being a Harvard student and highly educated, so despite how wild his show could get at times, he was still seen as well behaved and dignified. In this interview he starts off that way, but as we get further down the line he just devolves into pure chaos and filth, slobbering on the wings, smearing his face with hot sauce, yelling, frothing at the mouth, cussing uncontrollably. And yet it does not seem out of place at all, this is exactly what I’d expect from Conan.
this was the most chaotic interview I‘ve ever watched
there is no way that after this his stomach was okay!!
How can you tap out now?! Irish Conan just put his pipe down and said this is the standard.
Conan!!!!! I FUDGING LOVE YOU.
I guess they were right. Conan O'Brien can't stop.
I see y’all got God for this season finale
I continuously ask myself why I find this man so hysterical 🤣  I freaking love you Conan  Please come visit a BIG fan in the SMALLEST state.  401 for the win!
"You're not a doctor, are you?' "I should be" 💀😂
His heart gave out immediately after the camera cut 😂
No lie, no joke, this is inspiring!  ❤😂
Conan had me on the edge of my sit the whole time with the sauces oh my god Conan!😳👏👏👏
Every passing year, Conan reaches new levels of pale iridescence.
Conan is a National treasure
That was amazing. Coco knows how to entertain and he was a mad man with those sauces. That's why he is the best on all stages.
conan = absolute. legend.
What. An. Absolute. Madman.   Gave poor Sean Evan's a panic attack. I'm sure he was begging the lawyers to make sure he wouldn't be liable if Conan dropped dead before leaving the building.
I’ve watched almost every episode- 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
what late night host is topping conan? no one
Conan is a machine.  What did I just witness?
I've never seen him this crazy before
One of the best episodes ever!!!!
Conan be like: sauces got nothing on me, NOTHING!!!
Instantly one of the top 5 episodes ever!
I’ve never screamed NOOOOO at a Hot Ones video before. Now I have!
Best guest ever!!!
This.....may have passed Paul Rudd as the best episode in existence.
This is everything I’ve ever wanted from a Hot Ones guest. Perfection.
Instant Classic
wow.
Only Conan would take hot sauces this far!😂😂😂❤❤❤
LOOOOL THIS IS THE BEST HOT ONES EPISODE EVER!!!
ok.i watch...
Wow!
BEST. HOT ONES. EVER.
My goodness. Conan was epic here
finally
crazy bc i’ve been binging his yt channel for days
This rocketed into one of the top 10, maybe even top 3, eps of all time.
Perfection.
Best episode ever
That was a weird yet very enjoyable journey
The before and after of Conan and his side of the table has to be made please, someone out there
FUNNIEST INTERVIEW EVER 🤣🤣🤣
Next TAYLOR TOMLINSON and TIFFANY HADDISH
This is top tier content with two great interviewers clashing together making a recipe for this beautiful disaster of a show. 10/10 🔥🔥
Ive never clicked a video faster
I have truly never been more excited for an episode.
Conan is the man! ......DJ Khaled is a p.....!!!!
Almost as good as Icespice’s interview
THE BEST EPISODE EVER!
this is the best episode EVER!
Brilliant
Best episode ever.
A showman through and through
my perfect man!!!!!!!! (conan)
Always nice seeing someone giving Sean his flowers
The boomer humour is strong with this one
I love Connan so much.
I’ve never clicked an episode so fast. Conan is the best
A God amongst mere mortals....
Best guest
Conan complimenting Sean’s interviewing skills is precious. Straight to the resume.
by far the funniest hot ones episode ever
Ive never seen sean laugh so much and lose his voice. Conan was a monster in this
Conan knocked out da bomb literally!😂
Best Hot Ones ever❤😅
It’s the guest we deserve. For years I was hoping and finally it happened!
Conan is one of the pioneers of making awkwardness hilarious 😂
Didn‘t Sean told Shakira that last episode was the season finale?
Top 3 episode for sure.
Conan does anything for the bit.
I MF LOVE THIS! ❤❤🎉
I love how Conan visibly aged by the time he got to the last wing, he was dying but living to the fullest
Conan is the GOAT, He wins Hot ones 🤣
Conan is the last of the REAL talk show hosts... Everyone else is too far down the Hollywood hole
His eyes are completely bloodshot before he starts, and he is more Orange than Trump !
Conan took on the wings of death, screamed at the challenge, ascended to Halls of Legends going out in a true blaze of glory as he should. 😂😂😂
Forty years in business, titian of the artform, and he still cares enough to commit to a dumb bit where he puts the wings in his pocket. What a delight.
However much research Sean did before this episode, I don t think anything could have prepared him for this. He looked genuinely worried for Conan at some point... but not worried enough to interrupt what is the most memorable Hot Ones episode to date
this is the best video on the internet today!
OJ's death and now this? What the fck is happening today and where the fck is Norm?
fastest click EVER!!
I love me some Conan, he killed this interview
nah Conan is the legend for tanking all that hot sauce. Hands down the best episode ever
Conan was absolutely crazy here.
Sit perfectly still. Only I my dance.
Hmmmm... sometimes people go too far to be funny... I just thought that was cringe worthy....
too funny!
Haha most epic one yet!
Surprised Conan's most harrowing wildlife encounter didn't come courtesy of Jarod Miller, who never seemed to have control of his animals.
Oh God, made me laugh so loud 😂 thank you for sharing this moments
CONAN, bringing the FIRE!!  Honestly one of the best ever!  Probably top 5 for serious wing consumption.
Absolute Champ!
I was not expecting this chaotic energy with this interview. My jaw was on the floor the entire time
Maybe this is the favourite episode of mine
Conan is the best 🇮🇪🇮🇪
@17:23 Conan perfectly answered Sean's question with that spot on impression.
I love it. This is the most chaotic episode I have seen so far. I am crying... 🤣Best guest ever!
wow.  Conan was so very Conan.  That was very entertaining.    And thank you, Sean, for not telling Conan about Steve-O and the eyes.  Who knows what he would have tried to top that with!
Best episode ever!
This is a me issue. I love Hot ones, I love Conan; but I hate, hate, gross food sketches,  the moment he had it all bunched up in his mouth overflowing, I was done.... I was really expecting to see a memorable episode with Conan, that I could share with my kids, but this.. Nah, hard pass...
This was definitely the funniest episode that I've seen of Hot Ones.
Nice to see such a great host talk show personality doing so great in his life. He's such a legend. Always has been. And, of course, it's nice to see Conan too.
Best hot ones ever! I’d love to see Sean on the podcast. What a great crossover that would be.
Obligatory F Jay Leno post.
Conan O'Brien, Just amazing!!!! Such a professional 🙌🙌🙌 respect ✨✨✨
I Have been waiting for Conan to be here for years
Best Hot Ones Ever ..
THE BEST TO EVER DO IT
Best guest ever!
I didn't even watch it yet but I know it's going to be GOLD
Jose Arroyo's cameo and Conan pocketing the wings easily make this the funniest Hot Ones episode ever
Conan had me 😂 i Love him so much!
Dare I say he just made his way onto the Mt Rushmore of Episodes?
I clicked on this so fast! 🙌🏽
Best guest ever!
I’ve never laughed this hard at a Hot Ones. Ever.
🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Finally! A super great guest. Love conan. Im going to enjoy this watch Edit: just finished.. and as expeceted.. the king stays the king. Conans the goat
Conan wins Hot Ones! This was magical.
When Conan told Sean that he is a really good interviewer, I bet he was on cloud 9. To have someone who has achieved the level of mastery Conan has achieved give you a sincere review and it's glowing - that has to feel very good. Great job Hot Ones!
Theeee best one I think!
Best one.
That was everything I wanted it to be
That was incredible ❤
Conan is funny? what?
Pure freaking entertainment! 😂
My god.This will go down in history as the greatest and funniest hot ones episode of all time. Conan is the GOAT!!!
In true Showbiz fashion, I believe this is staged. When it cuts to Sean the bottles are back in the starting positions unopened, when it cuts to Conan they are gone. I dont believe Conan actually had the right sauce for the wings. My conspiracy theory is that they had to fake the sauce on the show because it would be the only way they could get Conan to do Hot Ones. If this is true I have lost respect for the show.
the best of the best
25:39😂😂😂this was a good one
Let's goooo🎉🎉🎉
Best one ever, period
The people who can’t complete the gauntlet have no excuse now
Conan not only understood the assignment, he rewrote the rules.  He’s the king.  One of the best episodes ever.
Are you not entertained????!!!
Never before have I seen so much fear in Sean's eyes. The David Blaine eps was close but dear mama he was so afraid for his own life here =))
Legendary. Right up there with Dave Grohl.
Ok, so… Conan wins Hot Ones. Didn’t know it was a competition. It was. RESPECT.
This might be the best hot ones
This is the happiest day of my life 😅😅😅😅😅
I was watching in my kitchen and when Conan dowsed that wing with “da bomb” and proceeded to lick it I yelled “Conan Noooo!!!” 😂
Best episode ever 🤣
L  E  G  E  N  D
I'm 😭
He puts the bones in his pocket 😂😂😂😂
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Sean, Blink twice if you're in danger
Did Conan... coat his tongue in wax like Homer Simpson to withstand the spice or is humor that much of a blocking factor??
This is THE best episode so far! .. this one tops the Gordon Ramsay episode!
Conan's the goat. What a perfect episode.
Idk who can top this. Absolute insanity and yet knowledge pouring out like those bottles of hot sauce. What did we just witness.
Conan is literally 'lost in the sauce' after that Da Bomb fiasko
Conan is undisputed hotones champ after that
I’m pretty sure Conan started hallucinating near the end there.. but he’s probably one of the few guests, maybe only one, that manhandled The Bomb sauce.  Great way to end the season!
Man I really hope he had something to change into 😂
People say men are afraid of commitment. Commitment is afraid of man, and his name is Conan O'Brien.
Conan has that dog in him
Best episode yet. Better than Ramsey
Man I'm really craving for wings now
Wow! Very impressed. Conan took it like a Monster!
I see Conan, I click.
The two great mf Hosts
The best episode ever!!!! Next Level!
“Was it a 4 year degree?”  “…it was supposed to be.”
My lord da bomb got nothing on Conan
Yeah Conan sorry not funny. Disgusting, yes, funny, not at all.
Conan is the best. 😂
Wow!! I don't even know what to say. That was spectacular!!! The best ever!!
Best episode ever!!!! Conan is a legend.😂😂
Sean admitting he let Conan dig his own grave and jump in is everything I needed 😂😂😂
Conan is an absolute treasure! Now get Sean on Conan Needs A Friend!
I need to see Conan and Steve-O in a room together
props to Conan
Did he just refer to Leno as "the other guy"?
What did I just watch? 😁🤣
legend
My life is now complete.
Absolute LEGEND 😂😂😂😂 Conan bringing his A game like we all knew he wouldn't. Best one in a long time.
"my intestines have turned into acid" HAHAHAHAHAH
I literally snorted cerealjuice out my nose when Conan took a sip of the sauce!
Does Conan have a weird knowledge about presidents? Two questions about them
Loved that the legend showed up and surpassed all expectations. Conan is 1 of 1.
I love Conan 🤣
Conan stuffing his pockets like Napoleon Dynamite, lol.
Getting extreme diarrhea as a bit
Conan = 🐐
i feel sorry for whoever has to follow Conan on this show.
The BEST Hot Ones EVER!
Love Conan🧡
My head hurts from laughing so hard. This was by far the most entertaining one yet.
1000% the best episode yet! 🙌
Conan is a legend, this was amazing
Absolutely incredible.
Eat this, Gordon! 😂❤  I want to know if he is alright, seriously. We need him.
I'm crying dying laughing 😂😂😂😂
EPIC!!!
"where did you go to medical school?"  "1998"
Clicking Like before I watch it. Duhhh It's Conan
This may have been my favorite episode yet. Love you Conan!
I don't think anyone caught when Conan said he would want Lincoln on his podcast because of his voice. That is sooooo funny because nobody alive has heard Lincoln's voice!
That was crazier than I would have ever imagined it would be.
This episode is Gordon Ramsey level good
No other guest will top this. This was peak comedy
Conan: Brings on bit with his personal doctor. Makes fun of the show and their "spicy" wings Praises the host of the show Steals the show Drinks a bottle of pure Ghost Pepper Refuses to elaborate  Best season finale ever
This really goes well when paired with Conan's bidet ad read
Conan comes in and smashes it! So funny! I ❤ u Conan - incredible! Now for a shower 😂😂😂
This must be the first most drunken man by hot sauce. Incredible!
Good luck to the next guest! That was so unhinged, so funny, and I’m here for that ALWAYS! Go Conan!!
Entertainment looked up in the dictionary, should just say: Conan O’Brien.
The dude was shaking while eating the last wing, but still speaking. Got to respect this man.
Well, that escalated quickly 😂😂😂
Conan's "doctor" should have been named Nick so they could do the "HI DOCTOR NICK!" gag.
easily one of the best episodes ever!!!
Top 5 episodes
Conan is one of my favorite people ever ❤️
Did Conan switch bodies with Sydney Sweeney recently?
i love conan
Thank you for finally bringing Conan on!! Makes up for the letdown from the last few episodes.
The king 👑👑
How am I alive? How is Conan this golden?? I can see his face turn red but he just ignores it and goes rampage xD honestly can't stop giggeling xD also, I can't WAIT for april 18!! I LOVED Conan without borders and I know I will love Conan must go!
Dudes face was redder than his hair.
Fucken savage best one yet and Iv watched every video
😂 I’m dying over here lol
Shame he never got to remain the host of the Tonight show, Conan is the man! If there was a Mt. Rushmore of tonight show hosts, Conan, Letterman, and Carson would all be on it without question
Through all of Conan’s zaniness, he still manages to keep it grounded and real and answers Sean’s questions with sincerity.  Why’s he’s the best and why this show is the best.  It gives an outlet for for celebrity to be goofy but also answer questions that are serious and well researched.
Absolute legend. 💯 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing
Tour de force. My god we will never see anything like this again.
I'm in my 40s, I've watched Conan for literally decades...and I'm always surprised how enormous his head is. I'm a 6'3 Irish man myself, my head is quite large, his is still gigantic. It looks like a special effect how big his head is.
So is he putting the wings in his jacket pocket to protect his DNA🤔
White Ken Jeong~
Best HotOnes of all time.
What's wrong with you people? you don't know what real danger looks like anymore 🤣🤣🤣
Nixon would be DOPE
First time I have noticed a bit of Trump-esque acting from Conan. Not sure exactly why, but I think Conan could act out some of Donald Trump's emotional states when making speeches to the public, or just answering interviews, even if the looks are quite different. There is something about the way a pale European face moves, I guess. Would be fun to watch, I think.
Him being disgusted by his doctor every time he calls for him 😂
I was dying watching this….conan is hilarious
Hahhahaha I fkn love Conan! Legendary!
If Conan survived deskinning in a korean spa this Hot Ones gauntlet is a cake walk
is he still alive after this show?
Probably the best episode I've seen to this day 😂😂😂
Absolute Legend!
Conan O'Brien is by far, the funniest guest of all the Hot Ones  shows. Great interview. Extremely entertaining Conan did not dissappoint!
As someone who just happened to stumble on this channel in its first year, I have to agree with Conan. Part of the reason why I watched was the gimmick, but I stayed because Sean is, and I can not stress this enough, a fantastic interviewer. Great episode. Cheers!
Beautiful
Conan goes for it. Always. We don’t deserve him.
THE MAN THE LEGEND
Sorry Shia. There’s a new sheriff in town.
conan is too hot for the wings
Glad Conan squashed that beef with the water buffalo. Hate to see two kings fight.
Incredible performance by conan😅 true goat!
On this episode of Conan needs a hotwing ♥️
Hands down one of the greatest and sweetest celeb of all time❤❤
My, Oh my! That was Conan, The showman. Da Bomb never stood a chance
I have been commenting get connan obrien on the show since 2016, FINALLY, BILL BURR FIRST AND NOW CONAN TO TOP MY REDHEAD GOAT GAUNTLET
Best ever !! Poor Sean holding it together while Conan is rocketing in the stratosphere 🎉🔥 🥵 🔥 😂😂😂
This is the complete opposite of the Ice Spice episode haha Conan is great!
Carter most mediocre
Best hot ones episode of all time
This has to be one of the best episodes so far...Mister Conan is a great comedian.
The camera panning down to the pocket is hilarious
Has to be the most legendary episode! Just pure, fun, insanity.
Dr. Arroyo is pretty much the real life Dr. Nick from the Simpsons 😂😂😂
Best episode
What did i just watch!? The best hot ones ever? This was incredible
Every second was amazing
Legendary episode, what a showman Conan O'Brien is!
Conan always brings it 🤣
This epispde is certified pure chaos and comedy😂
Conan killed Bea Arthur!
Best hot ones
Week 8 of requesting Dan Cummins! Amazing comedian of the last 20+ years and a vast podcast empire of the last decade. Would love to see him in the hot seat!
This might just be the greatest Hot Ones episode of all time.
the best
This might have been the best Hot Ones ever!
I‘m a Conan fan for years now, but I always thought, well people like letterman or Carson are the legends and the best late night hosts.  With more perspective now, there is no question in my mind that Conan is the GOAT!!  What I think sets him apart is that he is a legitimately highly educated and intelligent person who really is genuine. No scandal in 3 decades in the public eye!  He haven’t had a network late night show for 14 years and has not been on tv for 3 years. But he is as relevant as ever. He has a massive fan base of people (many of them younger) from all around the world.
So glad this popped up on my feed. Love Conan!
Why conan gotta look like that in the thumbnail man
Dude 😂 that is one of my favorite, chaos to perfection 😊
Hearing Conan swear casually is so jarring, in the best way.
Seriously though, has anyone checked on Conan recently?
I expected nothing less from Conan,best episode ever 😂
This show left me in tears.  Hilarious.
😂
I was never into talk shows (Maybe because I was too young and grew up with YouTube), but Conan's shows were always super fun and hilarious and I've never not enjoyed them. The dude is a showman genius!
That was the most entertaining shxx yet!  Yay for Conan for being SUCH a great entertainer! Brilliant!
This is Conan truly understanding the show and taking advantage of every trope that has been set up and finding a way to twist it
It feels like I’ve watched this for 2 hrs because I’ve had to pause, with sheer out bursts of laughter and rewind. I’m talking out loud to myself like I’m in studio audience. Greatest episode ever
That Gian Man!!!🥳🥳🥰💋
bro put even steveo antics to shame he really is the best to ever do it watching that show out off pure respect
I'm legitimately worried about him, is he ok after that?
9:01 commentary that could apply to the 2024 Golden Globes 👀
I don’t think another guest has gone harder than Conan 🤯
I’d love to see the after show on this one
He channeled Chris Farley FR!
Conan absolutely killed this!      and his intestines
Hands down best hot ones
Conan + Hot ones = Lewis Black
More Conan doing anything is always welcome. Always commit to the bit
Holy mid dab and gulp Conan!!
Happy Birthday fellow Aries! April 17th here!
What a way to close it out! Love Conan! Easy top 5 episode. Well done!
What a legend. You look good Conan. Love your work, nice to see you again.
Unmatched . Conan will always be unmatched
This is the best episode of Hot Ones I've ever seen and... of course it would be Conan's...
amazing
As usual, the greatest to ever do it
Living legend. Best Hot Ones ever!
Awesome!!!
This is what I live for
"Check my pulse. It's starting to race a little bit."  "It's there."  "He's very good." 🤣
I was genuinely scared for Conan at the end😂😂😂 I thought his heart was gonna explode.
Even on a different show, Conan still brings out the best bits
so is this how Conan going to be the co-host now
connan is 1.93? (6.4)  😮
god tier...peak episode...
I'm one wing into watching the video and it's already the greatest Hot Ones episode of all time
This show just rose to another level. Conan just destroys!
now THIS is how you do hot ones
Legendary Episode
Doctor Arroyo is such a great Conan bit. Loved him every time
The water buffalo story is so crazy that I thought he would stop and say he was kidding.I can’t believe I’ve never heard this story before I’m not even sure he’s told it before
This is the best hot ones interview I’ve ever seen?
Conan is just such a great comedian. My favorite quote of him is: '' Is DisguisedToast here ? Where is DisguisedToast ? ''
no, man, just no... there can never be a better episode than this one. fu connan, you ruined hot ones for me. you're the "Mad Men" of web shows. fu
The gasps behind the camera are hilarious
Conan O'Brien is a force of nature.   Havent been this excited for a guest in awhile.
This is the greatest episode of all time, never laughed out loud so much. Conans the GOAT!
it’s all down hill from here folks 😂
This is what I always wanted! Conan on hot ones, few minutes in and I'm loving it!❤
Wow! That's a great episode! Conan is a true showman! What a legend!
I absolutely loved this episode, Conan is so crazy 😂
Conan saved this horrible season so far..
best episode ever xDD watching it after shakira is just crazy lol
I really hope they discuss this Hot Ones episode on Conan's podcast.
Great episode. Need a Bill Hader appearance
Already a classic
Oh man, that was freaking amazing!! Conan at the end was absolutely hilarious 😂
This is one of my favorite pastimes
It's not my favorite style of humor, but this was a thrilling and interesting ride
Conan just beasted lol.
Yoooooo! Conan was wild! Bravo! I loved it! 👏🏾🤣
Not a good one to watch with a chest infection,
Yes!!!
Absolute utter CHAOS.  As Sean himself said multiple times, INCREDIBLE. Conan is just so good.
I just imagine, these scraps he putting in hi pocket, he givin that to Matt and Sona, 😂😂
Conan is the best, I miss him on camera can’t wait for the max show!!!
this guy has such zoomer energy
Conan is an icon
Love that episode with conan, now plz get roman reigns and cody rhides too im begging you
That Conan yell needs to be the end sound at the end of every hot ones video from now on. Perfection.
Conan is an absolute legend and national treasure. I am so happy for him to be featured like this bc this all well deserved. Can’t stop won’t stop Conan!
Conan!!! one of my fav entertainers
The louder Conan got the more he sounded like Master Shake.
I can't believe he started rubbing hot sauce all over himself 😂😂😂😂
Always been my favorite late night host.  All Hail Stoner Obrian!
Oh yeah this is unbeatable
Between doing a Nixon impression, making 3 Stooges references and going absolutely wild for the bit, this fits right in with the CONAF canon
Could not stop laughing, one of the all time best! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽😅😆
"I'm Fine"  - i see that "Everything is Fine" Dog inside his Stomach, everything is Burning. Most Insane and Best Episode! The Day after will be "greaaat" :D
UNHINGEDDDDDD HAHAHA i’m dead that sean was notttt ok 😂
CONAN IS NOT HUMAN!
FINE! ILL WATCH YOUR GD NEW SHOW!
Conan is such a good personable interviewer/interviewee. It’s cool you can even see Shane get comfortable here moreso than he does with other guests he has on.
By far the most unhinged episode ever.
The most unreal interview I've seen in this show. Not in a good way.
Cupcake O'Branflakes! He has my vote for 2024
This is the most unhinged episode, and that's a really high bar. 🧑🏿‍🍳🤌🏿
Wow, I think says it all.  Great show.
22:52 I didn't see Sean as worried as he is here, like ever!  Wow, what a show. Ladies and gentlemen, Conan O'Brien!
THE BEST EVER!!!!!
The other guy @6:25 😂
Thank you Conan, for always bringing your A-game. Incredible show, and we never expected anything less.
First time I actually seen Sean scared 😮😂
Sooooo, Conan is afraid of someone stealing his dna. 🤔 😂
Loved watching him. Thanks for a good show 😂
Unbelievable! Shooting hot sauce! Conan is Amazing!
"I never saw spice until I was 52 years old" I'm already laughing 😂
Best episode ever! Conan is a beast! Hope he is okay after this!
Sean has had many crazy guests, but he was not ready for Conan. This guy is next-level crazy in the best possible way. This was the best episode to date.
"I´m erected in the fisrt time for 50 years." You know what? Me too Conan.
BEST EPISODE EVER!!!!!!
The one we've all been waiting for. Thank you, Sean.
BEST GUEST EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new undisputed champion.  Conan showing respect to Sean by ensuring he delivered an unmatched and unforgettable performance as a guest.  Bravo to Hot Ones, Sean and Conan.
Best episode of Hot Ones..... 😂😂😂
The most insane episode ever.  Loved it!  Conan Rocks!!!
GOAT
I think Conan lost his mind after DA BOMB 😂😂😂
19:15😂😂😂😂
African style wings on pocket lol
ok can't wait for the show on MAX
About time you guys snagged him. What a way to end the season
HOLYMOTHEROFGODCONANISTHEFUCKINGGOAT!
That’s fukked up. Sean should’ve warned Conan about Da Bomb lol😂
and we all thought Dax had the iron tongue.
The pan at 23:50 from the absolute sauce wreckage to Conan’s unhinged face while he talks about the New Testament and Don Quixote is truly great art.
Greatest episode ever
Certified classic
Yes yes yes.
Conan's Hot Ones preparations . . .👃. . . .:.
This is probably the best interview ever…
Greatest episode ever! Conan is a legend
Only time I've ever liked Conan was when Bill Burr was talking to him.
I wonder if his doctor is affordable
ive been watching conan since i was 11 years old. thank you for your work sir
This is the funniest episode, maybe ever
This was wild
Dr Arroyo needs to be the Hot Ones standby temperature checker and hugger.
What a legend! Chugging bottles like water 😂
You know you've made it when Conan, of all people, calls you a great interviewer.
Why are the wings in his pocket
legend
I always forget how big Conan's head is compared to normal people...
This is the funniest Hot Ones I have ever seen.  I'm still laughing!
Oh my god you got Conan, you've come so far!
I’m torn between admiration, laughter and worry for his life
Conan didn’t wear his favorite jacket because he planned on stuffing chicken in the pockets 🤣
Conan on Hot Ones, amazing!!! No one will top this episode. Sterling Brown giving a whole Shakespeare Sonnet performance is close in the amazing catagory.
💀💀💀💀the GOAT
❤ this will probably be the very best episode. Conan is the best!! 😂😂
Conan O' Brien telling Sean he thinks he's a great interviewer has to be the highest compliment he can get.
This has to go down as one of the most legendary episodes!!!! One other guests has DRANK the hot sauces😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conan is simply a living legend
BEST F&CKING EPISODE OF ALL THE SERIES!!!! CONGRATS!
It is really a miracle Conan survived all that!!!
Has Conan been seen since this has been filmed? He may need a wellness check.
Perfection. AND Conan complimented Sean on HIS interviewing skills. Amazing.
One of my favorite episodes of hot ones to ever exist, thank you for bringing conan, he's a national treasure, one of the best comedians ever, but why is he putting the chicken wings in his pocket😂😂😂
THIS IS THE BEST
I really thought conan had too bland a palet to ever do this show, but im here for it
Conan went BUCK WILD 😂
Another Hot Ones White Whale!🎉
he's like my embarrassing dad
This is the one to counter the DJ Khaled episode...wow, all in.
This was the best episode ever. Conan had me dying 😂
Well that got chaotic
And then Conan takes a DNA test and finds out he has a bit of a place that has some of the spicest food in his DNA
Welp, hot ones officially peaked.
it’s cool to see conan returning to the spotlight
This is the greatest Hot Ones episode of all time. No question. Conan is the GOAT. Dude raw-dogged the last 3 hot sauces for the cause.
I can't wait to hear how Conan really felt after these wings, I've had da bomb salsa and it was so f ING hot!! I can't imagine what the last dab would be like.  There's no way he didn't feel that heat 😂
BRAVO 👏👏 BRAVO 👏 🙌
He's the best, that's it.
Maybe because I'm not American, and don't really know Conan all that well, but I really didn't enjoy this episode.  I know it's a 'bit', but I didn't find it funny at all, just annoying and irritating
i am out of breath from laughing and genuinely for the guest. conan is a beast.
Conan is GOAT’d for this one 😆
I like how Conan handled it just as well as Steve-O or David Blaine, but with his own style. Great episode.
The sauce spilling out on the table is a GREAT shot
23:00 oh, the memes…
"It's not a better name... I can't get used to it"  Classic Conan with the subtle dig at Discovery for messing up HBO Max over the past couple months.
BEST HOT ONES EPISODE OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!! CONAN IS A LEGEND.
First time I've seen Sean flustered. You just can't beat Conan
OH MY GOD!!
I'm gonna watch this at least 50 times, you just deserve it
Wow....Conan turned into Lewis Black at the end.
Yay
ICONIC
Best guest ever 🤣 chugging the sauce, champ!
Wow, Sean Evans was out-hosted in this one.
BEST EPISODE EVER 😂
I’m only halfway into the interview and already thinking of rewatching it!!
What an insane episode 😂
What a way to close this season. With a rapture of Conan shenanigans. 🔥🔥🔥
The Man, They Myth, The Legend - best episode to date, Conan blew everyone away from every prior season, not even close. Absolute trooper.
"Check my pulse." ::chokes Conan:: "It's there."  Peak comedy.
"I Yam what I Yam" - MK Gandhi, 2024
Conan is a savage. He kinda stole the show away from Sean
I enjoyed every moment of this episode, love you Conan
What a beast
Absolutely fcking legend
Conan the absolute showman and legend. Missed his sketches and his coco shows 😢
Sorry Conan is the goat. The GOAT
One of the best episodes ever!
This is about to be an all time classic
The close up shot of the Bomb sauce dripping is EPIC!! One of the best guests yet! 😂😂😂
I’ve never seen something so Aries in Aries season ♈️ 🔥
Man Sean getting his flowers from Conan as an interviewer must be incredible and surreal.
Wow
This is the best episode of Hot Ones to date
Conan is unapologetically unhinged and I’m here for it! ❤
Conan looks like a toddler who ate spaghetti lol
wow, is there a limit on how much scoville heat units a person can consume?? What about the aftermath? lol
With his recent uptick in popularity and announced show on Netflix, it would be amazing to see Shane Gillis on Hot Ones
The GOAT late night show host! Incredible episode
Nothing will top this one
Yaaaaas!
Most unhinged episode of all time 😂😂😂
Thank you Hot Ones we’ve always wanted this!
first guest to bring a bit, Conan the GOAT
Wanee wanaaa is back.... Thank you god
The sheer look of abject horror on Sean's face when Conan was licking The Bomb and the following wings.
I don't need that Nardwuar episode Conan is way better
Hands down best ever
wow
What an entertainer!!
Jeez Louise 😂 Conan O’Brien was an absolute beast
haven't watched yet, but since its conan...its going to be great!
This was so everything I hoped for and more.... Conan reduced to a drooling screaming maniac. This is a profound gift to the world. My only fear: Sona may laugh herself into some kind of coma when watching this.
This is probably the first interview in which Conan was never asked about The Tonight Show. And that's why Sean is the GOAT!!!!
Conan just raised the bar for hot ones interviews
THE most EPIC Episode EVER!!!! I have not laughed that hard in a long time! The fever pitch rises as it culminates to Dr. Arroyo saying… worthlessly… it’s not good…. 😂
Conan is and always will be one of my absolute heroes. He reminds me to be less cynical and not take myself so seriously
We're not worthy of Conan
If you love Conan, and I know you do, check out his speech at Dartmouth in 2011. It's great!!
🤣🤣😂 amazing.
Wow that speech at the end was inspiring honestly. Love ya Conan, I grew up watching you ❤
The GOAT!
Conan was a long time coming and he did not disappoint
His whole body will be on FIRE until the start of the next season. That's some dedication.
I cringed watching him slather da bomb on there
😂🤣🤣 love this dude
GOAT
Hehe Coco hurt his mouth.
Absolutely hilarious. What a great season finale. Sean had such a great time with Conan it was a real pleasure to see.
What a legend
Wow! Conan got the belt..he is the Hot Wings Champ! Poured on extra sauces including Da Bomb and didn’t even break a sweat 😂 Insane! Respect sir 🫡
Why wasn't Sean matching Conanan?
Wow! April 11th, 2024. I was here within the first hour of the upload to say that this is indeed the S tier of hot ones episodes, and the best episode I've seen yet. History was made.
Absolutely incredible
As a Finnish person, seeing our true God in His full glory is amazing.
How is no one talking about him pocketing the wings, such a simple joke but I laughed every time.
Finally, I’ve been waiting for this!
One thing always stands true for Conan: if there's a bit, he becomes Superman and will do the impossible
He's just plain out crazy.  Don't come at me, but I never got his sense if humor. Too over the top. But Kudos for killing the wings.
lol i knew this would be amazing as soon as i saw conan
Charlie Rowe 😆
Could Conan be anything else than legendary?
Is that a real doctor and if so that is sick and funny and fair enough ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
Im ready to see how Conan's skin on his face and his hair share the same tone!
It would have been epic if they'd brought back explain that 'gram, but instead of showing Conan any instagram posts, they played the Mac and Me clip.
When he drenched it in the last Dab like “what? Isn’t this the finale?” Conan did the WORK
23:00 when they say i need help with my addiction
Conan is a real maniac 😂😂
having a chris farley moment?
Conan used to eat at Wood’s Pit BBQ in Bantam CT. He knows wings lol
I’ve never laughed so hard during an episode… thanks Conan, thanks Hot Ones. 😂
what did I just watch?
The moment I’ve been waiting for 🖤😊
When 🦬 meets 🐐 . Best Ep yet!
BEST EPISODE EVER 😂
So happy he came on!
🤣🤩 The best I ve seen in all the seasons.
This is easily the best episode ever of this show. Conan is simply the GOAT
My mouth was open the whole time. Unhinged in the best way.
this is the only guest where i know they’re going to suffer the consequences 😂 also turning into lewis black covered in chicken and sauce doesn’t hurt either.
Best Effin Episode EVER!!!
I love Conan 😂😂😂😂😂
I FVCKING LOVE YOU CONAN 😂😂😂❤❤❤
This will go down in Hot Ones history. Maybe even the regular history books. Legendary.
Watching the fear in Sean's eyes slowly grow throughout the episode as Conan somehow manages become exponentially more unhinged with every wing is a visceral experience.
This is CONAN's show now.
This might be the funniest thing I've ever seen. I love it so much
Best show to date and this year, imo.  The luck of the Irish to ya.
Wow! The first man to disrespect the Bomb! This guy is pure energy of joy!❤
GIVE ME COCO OR GIVE ME DEATH!!!
Oh man, he's gonna regret this the day after.
What no this is the last episode all ready and we miss this all ready and it has gone by to and so fast ❤❤😂🎉😢😢😮😮😅
Can't wait for the podcast where they talk about the after effects of chugging hot sauce!  lol
conan is a legend!
Just Conan being Conan, expected no less ! Such a great Episode!
BEST.EPISODE.EVER.
This episode of Hot Ones killed OJ
Conan, for a lack of any word that describes such a scary mixture of pure comedy and pure redheadedness, is HIM. He is the powerhouse of comedy. The greatest.
That was fantastic!!  Great job!!
Can we please get one with Nardwar where they interview each other?
Conan definitely owned the show. Dayumn 😮
Wow!
He's such a Chill Chum lol
I thought I loved Conan before this interview... boy was I wrong. What a gift Conan has for being the truest form of himself and entertaining all the while... such a wonderful human.
The hardest I've ever laughed for hot ones. That was amazing!
Conan missed an opportunity to bellow, "I'm a golden god" or some such line.
Don't go to texas
I always enjoy interviews with Conan. He's an ideal guest, blending humor with insightful answers that showcase his deep understanding of his profession.
This is going in the all of fame
Conan is the best talk show host ever
obnoxious. almost didn't finish the episode
Now thats acting
I am laughing so hard 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. This was a real show.
Sean's usual tactic of "I'll follow what you do..." went out the window with this episode.....smartly.
You know how professional he Is when he brings another person just to make a bit, I mean he prepared for this stuff. Also, that says how much he respects hot ones.  Love him
Awesomesauce
Conan king of shock improv.
just "The Best"
Sean is giggling so much he barely got a question out
Best guest ever!!
Not the same and as good as last week and or but can’t wait let’s go keep this up and going and coming ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
I think this is the best episode I’ve ever seen
23:45 R.I.P. Da Bomb
I never clicked on anything so fast.
I should not be surprised that this is the best episode ever
Conan, you did that like a Champ!!!!!
I've never been soo aroused
Shout out to Conan for giving Sean props
have conan tell you how good Haiti is doing now
23:52 I love seeing Conan slowly lose it and have a nuclear meltdown at the end!!! hahahaha
The BEST EPISODE IN A LING TIME!!
this might be the most unhinged thing conan has ever done and that's saying something
Best. Episode. Ever. LOL.
THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT!
That 3 stooges impression was spot on 😆
Certified Gold!!!!!
This might be the best episode of Hot Ones so far.
conan went hard in the paint
I've been vocal in disapproving some of the other guests this season, so it's only fair to complement you guys on Shakira and CONAN O'BRIEN! Wow I can't believe you got Conan. A man so influential in my appretiation of humor if not by his shows by his writing in The Simpsons! Wow! like.... great job! Complement is the only word I can think of but it's not enough.  EDIT: BEST. EPISODE.EVER. I haven't laughed like this in a long time. Gosh I love Conan!
Absolutely cannot stand that guy. Give him the hottest sauce
I’ve always known Conan was comedically insane yet genius. 😂😂
This is the hardest I’ve laughed at a Hot Ones episode….ever
does Conan know he can buy all those hot ones sauce bottles? mans putting chicken wings in his pocket 😂
I didn't realize how completely insane Conan is until now
This episode and John Oliver's are the only ones in this season that I've watched for the guests and not just for Sean.
I wonder why Sean didn't mirror the guest on this one. Or did he? I couldn't see.
he seems like such a fun dude to be around
2 of my favorite interviewers.
The way I became slack-jawed when he poured extra Da Bomb on his wing. The commitment is unmatched.
Legendary legend on legends
I hope Sona and Matt got to try the wings 😄
you made my day❤ please Craig Ferguson next
Ok this feels like Christmas in the middle of the summer..
The way I clicked so fast, oml!
When the goat of late night compliments you >>>>>
This got disgusting to watch. But I love that he embraced it.
"CALL THE WIFE!"
I had to cover my eyes multiple times. That was amazing and horrifying.
Clearly the best episode ever
The GOAT of late night
Absolute mad man👋❤
This is the living definition of Chaotic Good
Drinking from the bottle like it’s normal is my favorite Conan but I’ve seen to date Jesus Christ
This gonna go down as possibly, the very best episode. I expected nothing less from Conan.
Amazing entertainer. That is Conan ❤
I really get a new sense of respect and admiration for the guests on the show. I really love it and getting to learn something good about someone I didn't know before. Great video as always! 😊🌎❤️🕺🏻🐶
over here dying laughing by myself, conan is incredible
Best episode EVER
He is insane!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
THIS IS IT!
Conan doing the last dab on da bomb. Epic. Legend. As with everything in life, take the bull by the horns.
“He’s gone… 👀”
Conan killed it on so many levels
Without a doubt the best Hot Ones ever!!!
Conan acts like taking eaten wings is a joke but he is gonna sell those puppies on ebay for bank
Absolute comedy gold, what a living legend. Congratulations on the best episode yet.
THE GOAT
One second in and I know this is going to be fire. Conan is the BEST!
Instant classic episode
absolute legend.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
10:56 is my new wallpaper.
CONAN FINALLY DID HOTONES!!!!!!!!!!!!
Okay this one was great, Conan slowly becoming more unhinged as the episode goes on is wonderful.
Popeye, Gotti, O'Brien ... great, no, GREAT ep!
17:18 : Conan holds up a glass of water 17:28 : Conan puts down a glass of milk.   That man is magic.
Effin LEGEND!!!😂😂😂
16:47 just seeing him pour that DaBomb over that wing made me flinch! What a legend. How did he do it?
Best episode yet
EPIC: Conan you are the bomb 😂
“THIS IS NOT A BIT. THIS IS LIFE”
lol he really went hard
This is historical just like his knowledge of it
Masterpiece
I havent laughed this violently in a while. Thank you.
Can’t believe that Conan pulled off a coolio towards the end😭
yep, best episode. you did it
Greatest hot ones episode ever. Hands down!!
I have not yet watched this episode, but i am certain it will be my Top 3. AND I TAKE MY HOT ONES RANKING VERY SERIOUSLY!!!
masters at work
Thanks for the video
I already know this is going to be my favorite hot ones episode to rewatch!
This is PEAK Hot Ones! 🔥🔥🔥
Coooonnaaaaaaannnn
Best Episode Ever!
The man is a menace, beware...by the end, Conan O'Brien became Conan the Barbarian!
"i brought my doctor" lol
Just when I thought this show could not get any better.. this has to be the best episode
Conan is hands down the best.
Finally!!
This episode should come with a warning. Panic-inducing chaos. Conan brought the house down!
This is complete chaos!!! I love it! Did Conan just become the best Hot Ones guest of all time?!
One of the best episodes ever. Right up there with Dave Grohl, Steve-O, and Shaq.
Guest of the Year!
Best 1 yet
Peak redhead genes on display.
I've never seen Sean being crushed.
When he did his plug/ rant at the end he sounded like Master Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
Wow!
Why was Conan unphased by the hotness of the wings? I have this on good authority (from a channel about conspiracy theories): He drank a bucket of vaseline right before the show, so he had all surfaces covered.
Somehow they manage to make Conan look more red.
I love Conan!!!!  🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was one of the most chaotic episodes yet.😂
I rucking love Conan… did get to watch his show as I was a wee lad during and didn’t know comedy was a thing.. Conan is what I aspire to be.. a mean bean not writing machine
Best episode ever 😂
This was so chaotic, and I loved it.
Well this didn't disapoint at all.. Jessus, Connan Sir, you are the greatest guest ever and host too which makes it especially weird, epic and beautiful! Truly match made in heaven! Love the ep. Keep on, keepin' on! P.S. I cliked "Like" button 100th times, that counts like times a 100 right ;)
Rockstar episode
LEGEND
Best Ever!! Smokes em ALL!!!!!
22:54 Sean is actually scared.
My JAW was on the floor the entire time that was insaneeee🤣
14:00 I cannottttt, I love Conan sm
This is by far the my favorite episode! I love Conan!
LEGEND!!...puts ALL the current late night hosts to shame
Duuuuuudee 🤩
Later laundry day: "why all my clothes smells like chicken?"
Funniest Hot Ones ever. Conan is killing me. Lol.
That was the best episode. No competition. So happy for you guys, and my condolences to Conan for having to deal with the aftermath of his mistakes. Truly the best in show business.
HE tries to be funny. He tries too hard to be funny.  He isn't funny
One word -  Legendary.
This will go down as the craziest and most hilarious episode of Hot Ones ever! Conan is a legend and knew what we wanted and boy did he deliver!
Conan needed the wings dipped in Mama Lizzies hot chili oil
deranged conan is unstoppable
Yes.
Best Hot Ones ever!!! 😂
I have been waiting for this since day one!
Someday, this show will end... or at the least Sean will move on to more serious interview shows. Someone else will take over this show.
by far the weirdest interview
Hands down best episode
Epic.
Best episode ever
Conan is an absolute force of nature. What a ride!
Conan casually dropping the greatest hot ones appearance
This will definitely go down in Hot Ones History of best episode!
YES!!! Dream collab finally here! ok this is the craziest this show has ever been, mad respect to conan, sorry but no one will probably top this.
He just kept lodging those bones in his jacket...
Love him, we need some Coco
No mention of monorails?
What a legend... the best to do it 🤣🤣
Best Hot Ones Episode Ever
This has to be the funniest, most unhinged episode of Hot Ones I've ever seen. Laughed from start to finish.
Yes!! Finally.. The legend the Icon..
I want that jacket! Sweet red stitching for the show. Hot sauce in the pocket. Nice!
I literally had the HBO/ HBO MAX / MAX conversation in my head when he said max the first time  and Conan literally verbalized every point I had 😂😂😂😂
This is just 💯🤍🤍 , and Sean, that jacket looks great on you (I swear I didn't know Conan was going to praise your jacket too). Lots of love from Chihuahua, México.
The shot of conan ranting about how the bible has comedy in it while Da Bomb slowly trickles out onto the table was peak Hot Ones, congrats Sean you've done it again. I want to see all the shots of Sean also ingesting crazy amounts of sauce, cause I know he was right there with Conan!
!Hot Dang!, no se la creía al Conan pero mis respetos, jajaja muy buen episodio 😂
One of the best episodes 😂
Conan makes me realize that robin williams would have been great on this show
Conan is showmanship what a maniac...I love him so much
this is the top, I don't know what you will do next :D
"Sands of time" quote at 6:54 is so appropriate!  Sean is the master of perfectly timed idioms.
And this will be watched again. Almost mandatory.
Daing, even for Conan that was a little much
He's so funny. Conan set the bar too high from now on.
case closed I guess?
Yessssssss!!!
YES YES YES!!! I’ve been waiting for this one for YEARS!!🎉
absolute mad lad
Good luck getting a serious interview out of Conan. This is now easily in the top 3 or 4 episodes of Hot ones ever. Kudos to Conan for being able able to stay committed to his writing through the Bomb dab. haha Having people just gingerly touche the bomb can never be good enough ever again post Conan.
Savage, genius, legend
madness manifested and i love it
OJ rip.
Conan O’Brien is literally a national treasure protect him at all cost even if to himself 😂
Finally an episode worth watching. This season has been bunk
Seeing Conan totally unhinged and I'm here for it 😂
Best one yet.
This is one for the ages! Team CoCo ALL THE WAY!
I'm writing this comment 3 minutes into the video and I already know this will the be the best of all time. I love Conan so much.  UPDATE, 24 minutes later:  I was right.
One of the best episodes ever!
Yes!! Conan! Been waiting for this one for a long time ❤️
The best interview ever... Fight me!!!
It finally happened! Coco is here😭
Dude really is too much sometimes.  Good luck the next day man.  Conan O'Brian needs the bathroom.
I’ve been waiting for this interview for years ! Conan did not disappoint! Laughed SO hard the whole way through ❤😂
Best Hot Ones ever
Love me some Conan!! Hilarious as always. Best show ever!! Thank you so much!
Not believable by any stretch of the imagination, but Conan gave an awesome performance.
Best of the Best! 👏🏼
Conan is gonna regret that.
Conan took masochism to the next level....
Happy Birthday, Conan.
I'm 9 seconds in, and I'm already linking, subscribing, sharing and all of that because I love Conan and this is gonna be a hilarious Hot ones.
My pockets are full 😂😂
I have not laughed this hard in such a long time. This is my favorite thing.
This was pure crazieness 😂
This might be the best episode EVER I was HOWLING in public
Conan is a treasure and must be protected at all costs. This was so fun to watch.
THE BEST EPISODE EVER!
He's so desperate for a laugh. Just have a conversation like a normal person
I've never been prouder of a Harvard graduate.
best episode ever
clicked so fast
I dont think there ever was or ever will be a better Hot Ones episode than this. I wish I had 10% of Conan's energy. I've never seen anyone outwing Sean before. Conans an absolute legend !
Conan will regret all that sauce drinking on the toilet later lol.
Best interview ever.
W episode!! Definitely my favorite all time!
Wait a minute! Sean got to interview Cindy Lou Who!?
I need Sona's reaction or aftermath piece. This was WAY two nuts.
Taaaytooooos!
Wild episode for the season finale.   Ate em like a champ.  Way to ride the wave Conan.
THE MOST ENTERTAINING GUEST I HAVE EVER SEEN!  I HAVE TO SEE CONAN'S NEW SHOW ON MAX!!!
Best episode ever, love conan
After all these years we've finally figured out how to put some color on Conan's face!
Two of the best hosts to ever do it. Conan and Sean! This episode will go down in history as one of the best EVER
Conan the mf goat
conan pockets his wing bones 😅
Finally the legend is here!
😂😂🥵🤣💀 "what's wrong with me, why can't I feel !?"  ♥️
Brilliant
Best Hot Ones Episode EVERRR
This didn't go the way I thought it would go in soooo many ways 😂😂😂
Wow this one was a ride! Rivaling to be the best episode ever?!
This is the best episode and it’s not even close
One of the best episodes
when you have the same birthday as the great conan😎
Conan did NOT disappoint. He came with the jokes in his pockets 😂😂😂😂😂😂 amazing as expected
About to watch. My favorite game is counting all the times Sean Repeats a sentence. Repeats a sentence. Once you realize that he does it, they really stand out.
The best. This was the best one ever.
Please have O.J…… oh, nevermind, he’s a Hot One now.
Firggin brilliant
Dude just dabbed the back half of these wings and took them like a champ. Legend.
Love Conan complimenting Sean! Well deserved praise!
FINALLY! I love Conan
I haven’t seen Sean laugh so much in a long time😂
What a shocking juxtaposition from Shakira just donkey-teething her wings like Squidward eating a krabby patty to Conan just slathering the sauce all over his mouth and body and destroying the set. Truly a spectacle.
Best episode in a while
COCO CHADS GET IN HERE NOW!!
GOAT
This whole interview just shows why he has always and will always be the best
greatest guest of all time?
Has anyone ever been more of a maniac on Hot Ones? 😂🤣😂🤣
I would love to see Jim Carrey on here
Dreams do come true 😍 CONAN!!!
Lol first time I've seen a guest actually drinks from the spice bottle and putting wings in his pocket.. good job Conan
Eva Longoria please!!!!!!
"CALL THE WIFE!!!", had me dying.   I'll say it, GREATEST EPISODE EVER!!!
Nutcase of an entertainer 😂
I love how Sean looks genuinely concerned after the last dab chug.
This entire thing was pure insanity and I loved every second of it.
The way Conan’s shtick develops and escalates through the show along with the hot sauces is absolutely phenomenal
“My medical school goes to another state guys you don’t know her I swear!”
Legend !!!!!! Lol
He's definitely turning red.
Jaaaaaaaaaa!
Conan is equal parts, hilarious, terrifying, and sensual.
THE BEST EVER!
Goosebumps
He doesnt need a doctor, he needs a Friend 😜🤣
Conan later died that day.
fricken love Conan. Could never watch any late night shows but his, dude is hilarious.
Goat
Conan Must Go! I can´t wait to see the Show
This has got to be the best episode ever LOL
His cronies are going to reverse engineer the Hot Wings show.
I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time. Love Conan!!
Wow Conan is so much taller than most guests on Hot Ones cuz the camera man is trying to get the Hair and the sauces in the shot and couldn’t. Too funny how short most entertainers are
Nice 🤙🏿
My god that was good, best episode ever
THIS IS LEGEND!!!! 💯💯💯💯💯🔥
22:59 has to be thee single most funniest thing I’ve ever seen on a Hot Ones video ever.   😂😂😂😂
This is by far the best episode of hot ones literally ever. I never stopped laughing and this just worked out great
Completely unhinged by the end there
I'm going to roll the dice on this one and go ahead and like before i watch... haven't done that in a hot 🔥 minute...
"Just feel for the pulse" "Its there"
omfg best hot ones ever
LOL, what a great Hot Ones episode! Love Conan. Couldn't stop laughing.
23:28 is about the time Conan starts to lose it a bit
Conan with his "doctor" and his joke, ad-lib...everything about him here. He's the best 🤗
Conan did not disappoint, Conan for President 2028
This is unequivocally the best episode I’ve seen. Conan gave Sean pure gold.
New favorite episode, hands down
Why cant i feel
This deserves to top Gordon Ramsay for views
Love Conando's sutble dig at Leno. The fans will always remember ✊
1:56 lol real life Doctor Nick or Doctor Spaceman
The man’s hair got redder on da bomb
Dear God!  Conan is unreal!
Conan's eye vein was the star of this show.
Why am I crying with laughter?  Instant classic
Two legendary hosts in one of the funniest, most entertaining episodes of Hot Ones yet!!
Oh my god this was unbelievable.
Oh my god, he just broke the whole genre
A 3-decade lon run on late night, and they used a picture from Conan's 7-month stint on The Tonight Show lol.
two toilets were destroyed later that day
😭😭 thank you sean, hot ones, and conan!!!
OJ died yesterday and Norm wasn’t around to make a joke about it  Rip norm ❤
Wow I haven't seen anyone have the nerve Conan had in disrespecting the sauces.
"This is a bit to you?!?"  lol
that was prety fcking epic.. what a boss man..
ANYTHING for a laugh.
Can't believe Conan is doing Hot Ones or in this case, Hot Ones is doing Conan. 😂
Absolute legend!!!! I think I might have to cough watch hbo after this
Best hot ones ever!!!❤😂
This is insane!
My eyes are tearing from laughter at Da Bomb.  Edit: Tears of laughter all the way through the end. Best episode.
I must say, this episode was very disappointing. Almost or just as bad as the Ice Spice episode. I now can't stand this guy LOL
The King has arrived!
🫣
😂😂😂❤❤❤
Best episode ever!!!
going more than a hundred percent! CONAN!!!
Conan the best comedian in the world O’Brien. Remind the kids what a real profesh is Conan ✨kudos for spilling
Oh my god, Conan really did this. Kudos Hot Ones!! 🎉
Greatest. HotOnes. Ever
Legendary
I can't explain it other than Conan was the most Conan I've ever seen him during this.
This is such a nice birthday treat! One of my favorite Aries in the hotseat of one of my favorite shows on YouTube!
Andy Dwyer: oh I let one guy examine my wiener. April: that guy wasn't even a doctor... Andy:  April:
Dream come true 😍
Kinda dull episode tbh
Oh I love him 😂 And his shenanigans 😅
Conan can act crazy, but I honestly think the sauce jacked him up even crazier. Like a drug. Epic
Oh my God Conan is gonna regret that tomorrow
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
One of the funniest guest!!!!
Most unexpected episode !!!
Completely unhinged.
1 hour coming in and ppl are already saying this is the greatest episode of all time
Unhinged lunacy. Absolutely phenomenal. No notes.
Mad Respect for CONAN
This one felt like a fever dream !!! Conan is on another level.
conan must have layered his mouth with candle wax for these sauces homer style
Holy sh* ... what was I just watching?
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
CONAN 🥰
Conan the GOAT
I would hate to be Conan's agent in 3 days from right now.
Now i see why he brought his doctor! Classic episode
This was funny, weird and not what I expected. But it did not disappoint.
The goat - period!!
Best Hot Ones episode of all time, and it’s not even close.
Happy Conan-on-Hot-Ones day to those who celebrate.
How has dr disrespect not been on here yet
I have waited for this for several years. This was far more unhinged and amazing than I could ever imagine! The drenching of wings in sauce, taking swigs out of the hot sauce bottles, Dr. Arroyo, pocketing the wing bones, Sean losing it near the end...it was beautiful!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Conan ate the wings like a beast! Definitely gained some respect on this showing!
He went full Network
The amount of jokes Conan brought
Hardest I’ve laughed in 50 years
I love whenever people ask Conan about president-related questions, he has an answer straight away for it. what a guy.  Finally finished this episode. Pretty sure this surpassed my favourite Hot Ones episode, which is Gordon Ramsay's interview
YES YES YES
That was pure chaos, and I loved it!
YES finally Conan!!! Excited for it 😎
I haven't laughed this much in a long time, purely awesome!
Should have brought Jordan Schlansky as his wing partner
Well that didn’t disappoint! He’s going to need to wear gloves to go to the bathroom for a while though, lol.
He called Leno "the other guy." He still hasn't moved on.
CONNIEEEE! but i thought Shakira was your closer for s23?! 😮😮
This is pure chaos
I knew there was a reason I loved Conan all these years. Absolute chaos, and I love it. So proud.
My ALL time favorite episode 🔥
I feel like I just watched a landmark in the Hot Ones videos. There is just no turning back after this. This was at times hard to watch, but OH MY GOD was it funny.
greatest of all time
i do love how we effectively just watched a man slowly lose his mind for the sake of chicken  hot ones is and will always be legendary
I want whatever conan was on that day, what a legend.
GOAT
This was hard to watch and impossible to turn away from.
When he drank the final sauce I was like how have they kept the “white man dies from capcasin overdose” headlights out of the news
CONEY O BUNYUNS FINALLY ON HOT ONES
ohh... he's going to destroy his toilet later 😂 pure chaos... classic Coco
I've never ever laughed so hard in a long time. This has happily cheered me up from a bad week. Thank you! ❤🎉
But black pepper is too spicy for Coco, though he is dead inside so maybe that will help.
I thought Natalie Portman and Shia Labeuf were wild, but man............ Conan just veni vidi destroy!
Best episode!!! 😂😂😂
The GOAT! The GOAT! The GOAT! The GOAT! The GOAT! The GOAT!
Honestly he’s a comedic genius
Conan kept asking why he can't feel the spice, well after 30 years of doing late night talk shows you're bound to become sociopathic at some point. That explains why he can't feel anything anymore
Best episode yet - Conan really raised the bar with this one! What a legend! 😂
This was the best interview on the show. Conan was fantastic
Best episode of the season, easily a top ten all-time contender imo
This was hands down the best episode I've seen.
I always thought he is a freak. Now I know he is a freak
FINALLY.
I'm crying... What an episode!
CONAN O'BRIEN IS A GOD FOR CONAN'S SAKE!!!!!!!!!!!~!!!!!! YASSSS YASSS YASSS!!!!!!!!
"They used to call it HBO but not anymore because people found it too popular. Now its MAX!"
It’s the podfather himself!
What an absolute legend
Conan's such a madman, you gotta respect the guy
I'm so glad I watched this one.  Best hot ones episode ever, for real.
Conan never disappoints!!! Such a great interview!
This is definitely a top 5 hot ones interview. Conan CONQUERED THESE HOT SAUCES
I ❤ Conan 😂
F*&K that was funny!!  Conan set the new standard on how to enjoy hot sauce on wings!
Best episode ever!
TOP TIER.  Put this episode in the Smithsonian.
Conan is an animal!
Oh Conan... that is REALLY gonna hurt when it all comes out of your body 😂👍🏼
I couldn't visually take in the last bits of the interview because seeing food all over people's faces grosses me out, but I kept listening!! Love Conan
Top tier episode. Conan is unbeatable.
GOAT of episodes.
The fact that he brought his doctor for this interview kills me. 🤣💀💀🤣🤣😂😂😂
I clicked this so fast I went back in time. Dinosaurs are cool by the way.
Best guest ever!!!
That was amazing
Man, one of the few guests who was able to take charge of the interview!
finally a last name that's not basic, conan you're my hero.
What do Conan O'Brien, Pop-eye, and Ghandi have in common? They are what they are.
I lost it when the doctor put the stethoscope on his tongue 🤣
That man walked in there knowing he was throwing that jacket away afterwards
The fireworks display will be in a few hours for both of them.
Instant classic! Of course Conan would exceed all expectations
This was a great interview once again
that was... wow. best of the "Excess" episodes id say.
This is one of the best Hot Ones ever uploaded.
24:25 Today we celebrate, our independence day!
Who else wants to see Conan make Jordan S. Suffer with him!
"Check for the pulse" "It's there"
I love conan!! ❤❤❤
An all time great episode
Top 5 interview
Conan the fire colon.
Why Da Bomb got Conan speaking in tongues??? 🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
This is nothing short of heroic.
FINALLY!!!!
Conan is the best. Literally. This episode is perfection. Protect this man at all cost!
Can you have the Lawrence brothers on? Joey, Andy and Matt would be a chaotic masterpiece.
Conan is the most chaotic neutral I have ever seen 😂
Conan wins the Best of All time Hot Ones guest! Just amazing
Love it
Yoo let’s go
"I grew around bland food". Proceeds to make the hot sauces his bish.
top 5 episodes
"What's the most annoying thing a guest can do?" is a perfectly timed question after Conan brings his doctor in for a second time 😅
I'm curious if he had covid and lost his sense of taste to some extent
Incredibly Conan to bring one of his OG writers on as a doctor bit
Unhinged. I'm dead. Best of all time.
More of people like Conan, less of "people" like Cardi B, please.
Instant Classic!
This was the best thing I never knew I needed😂
I swear he's the funniest man in the world.
Okay, this is funny, I know Conan is feeling like he gonna die, and he is handling it.
The messiest guest ever !
The doctor shtick was classic anarchist Conan lol
Dude is literally a national treasure
beating Gordon Ramsay for the most views is an uphill battle, but Conan deserves the 2nd most views because lots of fans were waiting for this to happen
Conan made me proud and have many gut laughs. Conan going all in on the wings! Spectacular guest.
Yesss, gonna be epic
Nobody can beat this. 😂😂😂
I haven’t watched hot ones in probably 3 years. Came back for Conan. Probably the best episode possible
The best interview yet.
This is top 3 for sure Conan killed it Absolutely brilliant 😂
Conan... BEAST MODE😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
How can you Top That Performance?
This episode compared to the ice spice episode is like night and day
This and the Paul Rudd episode are amazing.
So glad they got him.
What an absolute madman, I'm crying I'm laughing so hard.
Haha YEEEEEES Conan finally!!! Now please get my other favorite red head comedian, Andrew Santino.
I can already tell this is going to be my favourite episode of all time!!
FINALLY! This is the one I've been waiting for
You don't have clearance Sean!
I AM SO STOKED FOR THIS
GOAT
David Hopping slowly losing his mind as Conan puts more and more wings into his pocket, wondering how he's going to get that jacket clean.
I've never clicked on a video so fast
Ok, I think Conan just broke the show.  There's literally no point in doing any more episodes. He's the GOAT, there's nothing after him
Disturbing!  FUNNY, but disturbing.
I'm so annoyed that he ruined his jacket by putting greasy wins in his pocket)))
I was literally looking up the trailer for Conan Must Go to see when it aired and then this popped up! There is most certainly talk of gerbils!
I love this show. Having said that, this is the second one that I couldn't watch because of my misophonia.
Conan did go crazy hard with sauce 🤣 Awesome episode and even crazier Conan. Gotta love dedication 💪
Like this comment if you want Nardwaur on the show!
HOW DID CONAN NOT SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST?
Conan is an absolute savage with those wings and the comedy is great. I can’t imagine what it was like going to the bathroom after
Jack Benny is someone Conan has said he admired. I don’t think he knows though that Jack once stored chicken wings in his dinner jacket to go fishing with Mel Blanc.
Conan is the undisputed GOAT
This was everything I ever dreamed it could be and 10 times more
That was iconic!
Conan is now the Hot Ones GOAT
he's so unhinged 😭😭😭😭
The over acting by Conan made the interview almost useless
TikTok kids got nothing on Conan
This is probably the best Hot Ones of all time.
My favorite part - “Call the wife!”
He never been funny
Love the cartoon Conan brought
the best show ever
YES! The Hot Ones we all needed!!!
Watching this, I kept thinking the heat of the sauce would slow him down but he just kept getting more crazy. Probably the best Hot Ones of all time
It's the first time i see Sean overwhelmed by the guest
He always steals the limelight🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💔I love him
Literally drank the last hot sauce, has any other guest done that?
Yeah, that went about exactly how I expected it to. Conan is a legend!
That was amazing   😂
this is like an ancient evil, once defeated and imprisoned, let loose upon a world that had forgotten fear
I am crying laughing right now! 🤣🤣🤣 NO fear! Just goin for it!
Best one of the season
Conan has got to be the best guest on this show! He destroyed those wings!! Took the bomb and made it look like child’s play
Quite possibly the best episode ever.
This comedy gold man. Need another episode with Conan soon.
what a way to end the season! The best episode of all time. Koodos to Sean keeping up with Conan.  Big shoes to live up too for future guests. Wing drop indeed, Conan!
Easily the most insane and Best episode ever!
I SALUTE YOU, CONS!!!!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Utter insanity. I loved every minute. lol
Bestttt Episode Evererrr! 22:50
First time they’ve gotten a request for ham on the gauntlet
Absolutely brilliant from Conan. Best episode yet😂😂
My stomach hurts from laughing so hard and I am crying. What a comical genius!
The fact thay he looks so much like Gordon Ramsay but they dont have one thing in common when it comes to food😭
The only guest to conquer the wing challenge so well that the bar can't even be seen anymore.
I don't care about conman at all but that has to be a top five episode of all time
Best episode ever!! Conan is a legend!!
The stethoscope to the tongue took me OUT
22:15 Welcome...To Jurassic Park!
god bless this man always and forever.
INSANELY the best episode ever, the guest owns the host.  Thank you so much for helping me start my day out right laughing hysterically :)  Wing drop.
Conan superdabbed the last 3 wings! "I'm fine! I'm perfectly Effing fine!"
100% changed my views on this guy. Couldn`t stand the talk show mind you but this was a good`n 👍
He said he ain't taste spice till 53. That's hilarious 😂
Dr. Arroyo putting the stethoscope on Sean's tongue killed me for some reason. 😂
Conan is by far the greatest talkshow host of all time
Is he wearing the same jacket that Bill Burr wore on Hot Ones?
This is legendary.
Most of the "celebrities" on here are hacks... Conan the real one
0:21 But you told Shakira you were closing out this season with her. So which is it?
Doctor has office in the desert lol
You gave literally the whitest man in the world hot wings? 😂😂😂
I know he was never as popular, but I'd love to see Craig Ferguson on the show
This is now my new favorite episode. ❤so friggin good 😂
Yes! Yes! Yes! After years, we get what we've been asking for! I'll gladly forgive the few duds this season because ending it with Conan easily wipes the slate!
I'm dying. This is so funny!!!!!!!!
This man drink the sauce😂
The best by far love Conan
Absolutely amazing!!!  Way to salvage the season after Ice Spice and Gwyneth Paltrow.   Pulling victory out of the jaws of "wow, we are scraping the bottom of the barrel" 😂
Conan is a born entertainer. Man could go to a Mayonnaise convention and find a way to clown on it.
7:10 jeeeezzz to get that from Conan!
This episode was incredibly funny😂 ... Dr. Arroyo 😅
I came straight to the comments! 😂
The was the Catalina Wine Mixer of episodes. G.O.A.T.
This made up for a horrible season. He turned red and yellow.
Conan is a goat
Conan is a true showman, I don't think much people can come close to his level today
By far the best episode ever.
Wow, you can NOT top this!
He did so well❤
Conan O'brien can't stop.
Greatest episode ever 😂😂😂
Best one EVER!!
Absolute LEGEND of a guest
24:07 some id the oldest text we can decipher are insults
This episode cured my crushing depressive episode.
Wow! Conan on Hot Ones. Nice
Jesus christ this is the best thing I've ever seen!
He ate. And he DRANK.
TEAM COCOOOOOO!!!
Kudos to Sean I would not be able to keep myself together with Conans comedy 🤣
Legend.
I'd like to say, "no effect on me" 😂😂😂
That was certainly an experience of all time
Holy F Conan Killed him. Let us live like theres no tomorrow.
now that you've had Conan on, you need to get the Very Nice, Very Evil Danhausen
this is my Conan Empire
Dude does not take half measures lol
he's just the best
Conan is the best
😂😂
CONAN is SOOOO dedicated to the bit!!!
"Conan O'Brien Must Go" to the toilet
Conan is the Greatest Hot One’s guest of all time!
Definitely the funniest/best hot one episode!!  God conan is a comedy legend
Hands down… BEST Hot Ones Episode… EVER!!!
Instant classic! Loved this episode, for sure at the top for best episodes.Bravo!
THIS IS ABSOLUTLY GOLDEN🤣🤣
What a great episode!
From the fake doctor to the wing in the pocket to taking shots of Da Bomb… Conan IS showbiz
I had spent twenty minutes waiting for the moment Conan poured the spice over the wings and went WANEE WANAA WANEE! I knew it would happen at some point.
I was expecting this to be a classic and it didn’t disappoint
Conan is one of the few guests to make Sean break. Bravo.
"Wise words from a wise and stable man...." lolololololololololol😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sooooooo brilliant
I'm dead. lol
About time Coco!
Simply the best interview.
After Conan did that much of " the bomb"... you can see his soul leave his body!~!! What a Interview!!! One of the BEST EVER!!!!  The Poor man will be on the Toilet for the next 3 days!!! LOL  Bring Water Conan!!! LoL
There is no comedian like Conan O'Brien. There is no one who will commit to the bit like him.
I don’t think I’ve ever laughed this hard at a hot ones! Gotta love Conan!
Okay, this has been one of the most entertaining episodes of any show I have seen. Conan always set the bar high that no one can reach. I have never seen Sean laugh this much. It was  great 😂😂
Do the people who MAKE Da Bomb even like Da Bomb?
Can you even make another Hot Ones after this?  Conan did what we all wanted to see.
Dr. O'Royal Episode 1 of next season!!!!
The man is an absolute menace and i don't think anybody will be able to out do what he has done here today!
conan was a menace💀
This is probably the only thing I will ever watch ever from now on, thank you,   Conan, you’re my idol ☘️
Having almost died when I tried Da Bomb, I can only be impressed by the sheer amount of guts that Conan showed today. Even for comedy value, he took it as if it were ice cream. Mad respect for the man! Edit: Can I like the video more than once?
I love how Conan gets louder as he’s clearly in more and more pain
I love Conan, but that was gross
Oh this is gonna be a good episode
Whaaat The F!@k!!
One of the best ever. Easily belongs on the Halle Berry, Michael Cera, Steve-O list, although I think Conan diverted his heat reaction into amped up adhd comedy...but no heat reaction.
Finally a worthy guest! So far the quests have been nothing to get excited about.
I hope Conan brought Sona.  I would love to hear her laughing at Conan in the background.  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Torille!
FINALLY
LETS GOOOOO
Yessss hot ones .. the last few guests have been horrific. Finally back on track with the goat Conan
I haven't enjoyed an interview this much since Dave Grohl might be my new #1!!!
One of the first guests to render Sean speechless. Amazing!! I was totally busting a gut with that monologue at the end. Bravo!!!
The Greatest Show on Earth
I love you, Conan, you magnificent man!
As soon as i saw the thumbnail, I knew this was going to be amazing. Thanks Conan!
Has anyone heard from Conan since this? Something about Dr Arroyo makes me think he isn’t qualified to treat whatever happened to Coco after this interview.
Jesus christ
This was by far the best interview of the season to close on. THE BEST!!  Bring back Gordon Ramsey for a closing season
nice.
hahahahahaha he's such a disgusting mess by the end! I feel Conan and Ramsey need to share the table for a episode together
Beyond epic. Pure genius
I'm trying to think of something clever or witty to say but I can't find a way to express the way I feel after watching that. The Most Beautiful Soul, Conan O'Brien.
Conan was great. I’m cracking up! 😂   After Da Bomb… “in retrospect that was not a good idea.”
This is the best interview, period.
this is how it's done!
I lost it every time he pockets a wing 😂😂
It’s blacked out you can hear them that’s it.
I always grab my hottest hot sauce while watching this. I make it myself it's a mix of ghost, scorpion, and reaper
Doctor had me in stitches …!
Sean thinking "wow, Conan O'Brien is gonna go into cardiac arrest on my show"
Even knowing it was Conan I was not ready for the level of unhinged this was.
gross
This was pure🔥 😂 best episode in a long time!
Sean and Conan… Legendary!!!
Simply the best.
Bless you Conan you saved this season
Amazing. Thank you for doing it.
I have been waiting for this guest for so long <3
Just embrace the chaos!
Conan Obrien, absolute legend, perfect finale.
Finally after all these duds of guest this season. Someone worth watching.
This is officially my favorite episode now!!! 😂😂❤❤
Yes!!!! Finally!!! The GOAT!!!! 😄😁👍
I have watched since the first episode and by far this was my favorite episode ever!
MY FAVORITE TWO HOSTS SITTING TOGETHER
I Love Conan!! I wish this could have been longer!! Haha
Conan 🫶🫶🫶🫶
Try New Mexican Chile CHILE not chili
Best episode yet! Conan is one crazy dude and I'm here for every second of it 😂
Conan is one of the funniest people ever and this episode is probably my favorite ever! Conan's compliment to Sean was spot on!
Love conan soooooo much and so happy these worlds collided 😂
YESSSSSSS
Wing drop
Imo one of the best guests of all time.
Ridiculously good viewing.   Thanks so much Sean &co….
This is the most unhinged episode I have ever seen! Holy cow!!
this is the greatest episode of Hot Ones to ever air. And I'd expect no less from Conan O Brien.
..." Doctor Doctor cant you see I´m burning burning!"
Love, Conan. He embodies 90's humor but is timeless at the same time. ❤ "This isn't a bit!! This is life!!" "I've never felt so ALIVE!" "What's wrong with me?! WHY CAN'T I FEEL?!"  LLAP CONAN!!❤❤
WHAT!!??? NO WAYYYYY!! CONAN O BRIEN FINALLY MADE IT!!! 😂😂😂 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The great RED one ‼️wow that’s a great get 👏the MAN the MYTH the LEGEND 💯
I LOVE YOU CONAAAAN
This is the craziest episode I have seen yet!!! 🤣
I really hope this one gets as much attention and love as it deserves for that amazing effort from Conan! awesome show, awesome people and great comedy!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😁
The most insane episode yet. Coco can really hide his pain. That, or he's an alien.
This was a first
Conan is the absolute best. What insanity.
Bros done so much coke he can’t feel spice 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Conan's amazing, so glad you managed to book him!
Conan was an absolute madman by the time the bomb came around… unforgettable episode!
Greatest hot ones of all time???
My favourite contestant.  👵🇬🇧❤
This was awesome. I know Conan is great to watch but man! This was good.
Conebone69
"you are a very good interviewer" from CONAN is a huge W  as an interviewer
Wow.. Such a great episode that ones gotta be in the top 10 of all time
16:31 Oh. No...
"I am what I am" -Conan, Gandhi, also Popeye
Never clicked so fast
If the next season doesn't open with Henry Cavill we riot 💯
Conan is the stupidist comedian around!  He is not funny and his jokes are boring and pointless.  His career to me is useless.  That being said I get other like him and that is why the world works.  I hope the best for everyone.  Just posted my opinion.
most watched of all time mark my words!
The best
The best thing I’ve seen.
Absolutely the best Hot Ones ever!!
We got Conan, Keanu is next.
I love this show and I thoroughly enjoy each episode, but THIS one. I’ve never busted out laughing so many times from a single episode 😂
that was incredible. conan is amazing
I think that Conan finally snapped at the end X)
Conan O'Brien is an absolute unit
One of the best episodes ever!
legendary
😭😭😭😭
Conan is great! next invite Luke from the "Outdoor Boys" soon!
The Cone bone's takin' it to the heat zone😂
Conan you badass MFer! 😅😂🔥🔥🔥🌶️🌶️🌶️
jesus christ conan
It's official, Conan isn't human
He’s gonna be a comedian. I know he has a talkshow host.
I have never clicked on a video so fast. I literally gasped when I saw this. Like so many people, I would stay up late as a kid to watch his show, but only during summer cuz I was lame. His whole body of work is great, and I've spent countless hours watching his old shows. It's truly my comfort show when times are tough. I can't thank Conan and all his writers, crew, and guests enough for all the years of entertainment. He's the BEST!!!  Edit after seeing the episode: Wow, I think he has more energy now than he ever has. Definitely born to be a performer.
love conan, great episode. thanks conan for coming on!
Conan’s quick wit is entertaining
Uh i didnt love it 🙄
Never clicked on anything so fast in my whole life. This is a lifetime moment.
Conan’s quick wit is impressive
Dr. Arroyo using the stethoscope on Sean’s tongue 😭😭😭
This is up there with the best Hot Ones episodes, absolutely iconic
This was awesome. I can't breathe 😂😂😂😂
Conan is the Goat
This is the best episode ever. Not just Hot Ones. Not only on medium format content. But just the best episode ever on anything that was and has been recorded since the first cuneiform record.
Cannot see this
Finallyyyyy
Sean getting high praise on his interview skills from Conan makes me happy. I could see the genuine appreciation.
Best episode ever lol
This episode alone has salvaged this season! Thank you for finally bringing us Conan!!
Love the chili face!
YALL GOT CONAN!!!!!! Thank you thank you thank you
Conan...kinda Semi taking over Sean's show. 😂. May be the best episode ever. 😂 Definitely in the top 10😂
Conan looks like a giant next to Sean lol
This is the craziest episode maybe ever
This has got to be the most chaotic, entertaining hot ones episode I’ve ever watched🤣 Conan absolutely crushed it!! Great way to end the season❤️
So is Conan dead now?😢
This is the best episode and can't be topped. Conan understood the assignment and delivered. Well worth the wait pack it up everyone can go now.
Finally yes!
By far the best f!@#$&^ episode ever..!!!!!!!
What an episode! Best ever!
Loving the rise in new Conan content! CONAN!! Sending LOVE from KOREA!! <3 <3 Thank you hot ones for showing CONANNN!!
Conan is the cleanest eater of the year!
Ugh I love conan! What a good choice for the finale!! Next season tho…. KESHA…🎉🎉🎉
This was absolutely beautiful
i love conan!!!!
Least favorite episode
What the heck did I just walk in on? Chugging hot sauce bottles, rubbing it all over body, dunked more sauce on the wings etc. Conan is an ANIMAL!!! That dude made those wings his b***h 🤣. And this is someone who claims they have never grown up eating spicy foods. Wow. I'm left speechless 😱.
FINAFUCKINLLY
There’s a toilet somewhere that did not have a great time when Conan walked in
Conan is a beast!
Conan is a strange, disturbing mix of Robin Williams, Chris Farley and David Letterman.
Wow! Did Conan just top Steve-O?
Conan O'Brien is pure insanity here! Lol
Listen I love this man (Conan), u put his name anywhere and I will watch, it's my duty
still no Keeanu!
RESPECT!
The Super Bowl of First We Feast!
Best. Episode. EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No one will ever handle Da Bomb better! That was insane how easy he made it look 🌬️
All right Conan 😅
GOAT
Hands down the Very Best Episode Ever! Love Conan. Stay a real one Conan. The whole episode was my favorite part.❤❤
Legend
The GOAT.
Amazing
I haven't gotten to the end yet but I feel like His attitude towards the hot wings is going to rapidly change😭 Edit:I have now finished the video and I must say I was absolutely correct
Honestly the best show so far, I love Conan and his antics.
That was incredibly AWESOME!!!❤❤❤❤
This was the most Conan thing I have ever seen and I am here for it.  True perfection
The poor toilet
YESSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This by far is 1 of the best episodes
What a savage!
This was beyond my expectations I love you Conan!
I genuinely what to see Conan interact with jerma
I never considered that Conan would make a great Batman villain, but then I watched him eat Da Bomb
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Team Coco 4 life!
I can't say i expected the episode to go that way, but i feel like i should have.
Best episode to date! Conan is the GOAT
finally.. some one we like is here too
There was talk of gerbils!
IDK why but I was expecting Jordan Schlansky to show up
Two of the best interviewers of the century!
Also I loooove that he brought Jose Arroyo, one of his looooong time writers - a nice little easter egg for the long time Coco fans
He’s truly the best!
fckin funny😂😂😂
Great way to end the season!
The most unhinged I've seen Conan!
Conan. Come home. I miss you.
This was the show we needed and deserved. Sean had one of the best talk show hosts tell him he was one of the best. Definitely one of the best season finales and best episodes of hot ones period. Conan did this for us and as a fan, I’m thankful. At like wing 6 when he started pouring the sauce, I was like, this is gonna be hilarious. Kudos to one of the best talk shows ever thought of and Conan, you sir are a treasure!
Conan, you're a legend. I love you man. A true Hero
Okay… we got this Ice thing… that was terrible. But on the other hand… we got THIS behemoth of an episode! 😮🤯 I… I… I can’t describe what I just witnessed… 😨 is this the greatest heat tolerance episode of all time?!
Conan is destroying these wings and taking them with him 😂😂😂 This man is committed!
I feel like I just had a fever dream about the new Conan ep of Hot Ones and that I should be waking up at any moment.
WOW! wowowowowow!!! 🎉🎉
Bring Mr. Beast @hotones ♥️
Conan’s not wrong. Sean is legitimately one of the best interviewers of his generation.
Greatest episode ever!!! 😂 I'm laughing so hard through this whole thing! 😂🤣🤣
That was by far the best episode of hot ones of all time. I was in tears laughing.
BEST EPISODE EVER!!! CONAN IS FOREVER THE BEST!!!!
Conan is the Boss! lol 1 of the best guests for sure!
What the fudge?
After that ice spice interview we needed this thank you Conan
Oh this didn't disappoint. Best season finale ever
this is hot ones best episode. conan killed it !!
Another level 😂😂
Holy $#!+ he was ruthless with Da Bomb and it came back to bite him.
I can't believe you managed to get Conan to do this!
Its between Conan and YG for who  handled the wings best for me, top tier guest😂💪🏾
👏👏👏👏
I wish I could say I'm surprised, but Conan putting in the most chaotic and ballsy performance with those sauces, is actually totally on brand
Immediately searched Conan O'Brien Water Buffalo lol
Legend.
Conan. Words cannot describe the joy I feel watching you demolish these wings. Make everyone except maybe Michael Cera look like a chump! Thank you
FINALLY!
What a hero.. 🙂
The man is UNHINGED... idk how Sean held it together
I'VE BEEN REWATCHING CONAN REMOTES AND TRAVEL VIDEOS THIS WEEK and now they release this
Aaaaaah it has finally happened, can't express my happiness, love Conan
I think I'm more terrified of Conan doing what he did with the hot sauce vs Steve-O pouring it in his eyes.
conan went hard!
Fun fact: the only effect hot sauces have on Conan is that it makes his hair more red.
I'm sorry, Paul Rudd. You have just been dethroned.
I've wanted this since Season 1.
Wow he fully committed 😂😂
Truly, he is lost in the sauce.
I love how Conan gave him his flowers in the beginning of the episode
So Conan’s “doctor” isn’t a real doctor right?
I Just love Conan
BEST HOT ONES EPISODE EVER
Best episode yet!
I’ve been wanting a hot ones episode with Conan and it came true! Conan is forever the greatest and funniest late night host of all time. Finally someone good and probably the only good guest they’ve had this season
Conan is keeping the wings because he is afraid that someone could get his DNA from them and produce his clone.
Oh My God
That was insane! Bravo
That was the most epic Hot Ones closing statement from a guest ever, officially will go in the HOF 😂😂😂
This episode went by WAY TOO QUICK.  CONAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm literally screaming!
Yep he really lost it here😂😂😂
"Don't commit to the bit. Commit to life." Huh. Gonna remember that.
AHHHHHH IT FINALLY HAPPENED!!!! YESSSS!!!! CONANDOOOOOOOOO!!!!
This show just peaked
KATAKAIIIII
Legendary descent into madness. Conan is the goat
Conan really surprised me, he can handle spicy more than most.
That was the most unhinged thing I've seen to date. Just pure chaos
My most wanted guest and of course he delivered!
23:36  Jurassic park! 😂
I think this is the hardest Conan has ever made me laugh and that is REALLY saying something! 😭😭😭😭
After 300+ episodes, Conan shows up and does 2 things 1. Makes the best episode ever 2. Proves my theory that the wings are not nearly hot enough.  Genius!
The Hero has arrived
My coworkers are going to think someone died as I currently am crying from laughter. Conan is the GOAT
Conan is a treasure of the people. One of the best to ever do it!
when worlds collide! Yesss!!
3 words::: best episode EVER😂😂😂
IS THIS EID GIFT OR WHAAAAAT 🥹❤️
Single GREATEST episode ever. Period
Way to close the season! Conan is a real showman!
How do you top this one? Conan is the GOAT
UNHINGED
describing Warren G Harding with "good looking guy" is insanely funny
Thats why he's tha goat
This will get billion views in a day.
Ahhhhh Conaaaaan
“Letterman… the other guy…”.   I guess old wounds never heal.
oh my gosh!
This is the best episode of hot ones ever, and it's not particularly close. What an extreme performance from the GOAT of Late Night
This guy is the best😂
No question this is the best episode ever
Proper guest this week!
Greatest Episode of all time IMO. 🤐😱😱😱
YOU HAVE TO PUT EVERYTHING TO IT
Is Conan ok today!?😂😂😂
WOW
Well, the rest of the internet can go ahead and take a day off. Conan is on Hot Ones. We are satisfied.
No one has taken Da Bomb down like that!
Love Conan, he is just like your odd uncle you see maybe every couple Christmas, have couple drink, and have fun with playing board games he will let you win just to make your day.
Conan is MFin' INSANE!!!
Even Sean seems a little star struck. Conan just controls every conversation he's in haha.  Great episode.
This is it. The pinnacle of Hot Ones. This will never be surpassed.
Just got the new OJ Simpson died
100% conan took some medicina which takes away the pain xdd
The dude asking finally fot his episode
top freakin Five of all time it will take 10  more seasons to top this lol Epiclly an instant classic!!
Ahhhhh I'm so exciteddds
What an absolute psycho!...I did the line up and I was pacing and screaming for a half hour..what a absolute legend
Instant fan. Wow. Love you, Conan.
ALL TIME EP! The one EP where Sean couldn't "mirror" the guest. HAHAHA
Wow! Conan absolutely crushed it! I don’t think anyone will be able to top him.
Jfc him keeping the bones is so funny. This mans a legend
they need to get Jordan Schlansky to do Hot Ones
i just want to point out you said to the last person they were the season finale lol
This has been the best episode of hot ones in a longtime ❤❤❤
This was absolutely chaotic in all the best ways.
Well to be honest, that was a little too much. Boooooo
We have Conan, now when are we getting Keanu?
im not the biggest conan fan but that was phenom
I love Conan so much. So much chaos!!
Haha
My favorite host ever
“Was it a 4 year medical school?” “Suppose to be” 😂😂
Literally just looked up conan to srr what hes been up to.
I knew this would be chaotic and Conan delivered....Sean is going to need a vacation after this.
Conan was fantastic, and him going rogue and just adding more sauce was insane. Da Bomb never fails to bring folks to their knees, from The Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin, to Charlamagne The God and Bryan Cranston, Da Bomb is undefeated!!
Yep. That was about as unhinged as I thought it would be. Conan, you're a legend
To Mr. Conan O'Brien: Oh my gosh! 😅 😮
I have never seen a better hot ones episode 😂😂😂 This better get millions of views 😂
THE GOAT
You can't top this episode!
I'm going to need a few beers and a bucket of popcorn for this
Conan just makes you want to live life to the fullest
Never clicked so fast while simultaneously screaming.   I honestly didn’t think this would happen.   Fingers crossed he makes it through.
JESUS
Conan’s comedy gags while also having genuine answers made this such a great episode. I’ve always loved Conan and he did not disappoint!  Edit* My God, I did not know the chaos that would unfold by the time we hit the bomb. Absolute madman 😂😂😂
INCREDIBLE.
7:03 You could tell it meant a lot to Sean to hear such high praise from someone who is himself a very good show host. He said what we all often think which is that Sean is genuinely a great interviewer, wings or no wings. In fact I often find it frustrating when he asks a great question but the guest is consumed by the spice and can’t give an equally well thought out answer, but I guess that’s part of the shows charm is you never know what you’re gonna get out of a guest
No way!! It's Conan
Can someone just let me know if Conan is still alive??
steve o and conan need to have a wing off
Now i gotta get max
S-Tier
Matthew Lillard next!!!!
“The other guy” Conan still hates Jay Leno 😂
Best guest ever. Definitively.
My life is complete. I can die happy.
Jfc on that last wing I'm just exclaiming "oh my God. Oh my god." What a performance. Bodied this show. Conan. Wow.
Oh man….talk about commitment. Conan on the hill in Ireland. Windy. Watch it.
Cut back to "I'm Fine" had me rollin
Psychotic
You know Conan is a real showman when he brings two of his own comedic bits to the show as a guest.
Incredible... most unhinged episode so far. I hurt from laughing.
Good God that's insane. Conan lived up to that name.
Legend
This was the best and crazest episode ever AMAZING.Conan thank you for saying what we will have known Sean Evans is one of the best interviewers ever.
Can't fault his commitment hahaha. Great ending to a season!
Sean was clearly not ready for this level of awesomeness. When I say awesomeness I mean insanity :) Craziest episode ever!
Finally. Someone good this season
POURING Da Bomb is unbridled
Wow, dude. Is he on ketamine?
This might be the greatest Hot Ones episode of all time.
Finally ❤
Sean has NO control and it's epic! This did not disappoint! LEGEND!
So happy with this! Thank you and thank you conan for being brave to do this. 2 great hosts sitting together!
now this is the face of a champion (and the great clown pagliacci) 18:31
“What’s wrong with me?” 😂
How? 18:24
I think this might be the definition of unhinged
Conan is the GOAT! Hands down my favorite talk show host! Tired of Fallons fake laugh...
Conan is the best ever
We wanted Conan and boy did we get Conan 😂  Forever one of the best Hot Ones 🍗🥵🍗
I worried Conan was gonna go all zany wacky the whole time but what a great interview. I cannot imagine what it must be for Sean to be sharing eye contact with Conan freakin' O'Brien as Conan compliments Sean saying he is 'very impressed' with Sean as a 'very serious interviewer'.   Mind blowing for me to imagine. Imagine Sean in the moment. Wow. So cool
Conan's gonna get some crazyyyy poops after this
Chairman of the Bored
Met him about 12-14 years ago at the 5th ave Apple Store in nyc. Just a random pop up in the store and got a pic with him 😄 didn’t realize he was so tall!
Jesus, he took that like a champ
pretty mild episode ngl
The guy IS entertainment
This was ungodly hilarious. I love Conan.
I've been waiting a long time for this🎉
😮😮
and that wter buffalo is now called MAX  but this is the episode we were all waiting for
I honestly thought he'd struggle so hard with these, but he KILLED it better than anyone else. He's not human. He's a god amongst us mere mortals! Team Coco forever!!!
Oh man i feel bad for the toilet that witnesses the aftermath of those decisions 🤣🤣🤣 ALSO I WANT TO SEE HOW HE WAS AFTER THE VIDEO the unraveling from the sauces constantly hitting
Been watching this show for years. Without a doubt this is the best you’ve ever done
Ive never really watched late night shows. But I've always found great enjoyment everytime I saw a clip of Connan interacting with celebs I follow and such. But still, this is probably the most entertaining Hot Ones since Shaq. It might even take the cake.
Omfg 😂 the way he eats the Bomb is the best thing I’ve ever seen
sean looked very worried.. LOL
Jesus Christ, that is an absolute S Tier of a booking. Only one that might top this is Nardwuar. Please make it happen next season🤞
Don’t think I’ve ever clicked on a video this fast before
Sean and Nardwaur need to collab.
BEST guest ever 😂😂😂😂😂
There was talk... of gerbils.
This is the best one yet. I love me some Conan.
"The other guy" 6:23 😂
Yes!! Go Team Coco!
Yessssss I've been asking for conan for years. Suprised, and ecstatic, he was willing to do it
If your jaw didn't hit the floor when he went full Da Bomb, you haven't watched Hot Ones before.
Sean looks scared
gold
Godspeed Conan’s blowhole 🫡
He should of done it along side Jordan Schlansky
13:34 *Other guests drink milk after a hot wing to calm down conan on other hand sips on whole sauce bottle*
My morning just got better, I love Tilda Swinton.
Absolutely hilarious !!!!
Conan is the final boss for hot ones
There's a  new number one episode of all time.
Oh my god, Conan is a beast!! When he grabbed da bomb I literally started yelling "NO! NO! NO!"
Conan is a real one.
The GOAT
Well, my birthday is April 19th... huh!
Man I love Conan
Other then the ladies my second favorite Redhead, lets go Conan
I've been waiting for this moment for years. Jordan better show up and gets a mention.
"Where did you go to medical school?" "1998" Absolute peak comedy
Already an instant classic. He brought his own Dr. Nick Riveria. 😂
Finally, Conan! Now we need Stephen Colbert!
😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Can I keep these?" 😂😂
Yesss it happened!!
Conan is a legend
Not wing #9 🤣🤣
Adrien Brody, I think would be fantastic on Hot Ones!!! Make it happen Sean!!
Finally! Finland loves you Conan ❤
I've said it in a comment some time ago that it would happen when he had to promote the show and now it's finally here, let's go
This tops Steve O!! So good!!!
The best guest so far
not even at the last dab and this dude is the GOAT.
I’ve been on a Kevin Nealon and Conan binge and the world knew it.
22:30 Me when I stand up from the toilet. :))
Best episode of Hot One❤
of course conan does a “bit” in his interview with the fake doctor 😂
CONAN, MY GOAT
God tier content
For people that can't taste what just beef with no seasoning and chicken with no seasoning taste like. I feel sorry for you. You're not missing out or anything. Don't get me wrong. It's just that your taste buds are not tuned enough to be able to taste all of the good parts about other foods. That's the sad part
You can see the only thing Conan fears is accidentally dropping character
A Theo Vonn episode would be amazing.
This is the best hot ones ever 😂
I love Conan clips and I love this show, I am surprised by this collab but can’t wait
Finally a good one!
Again props to the research team that deserves all the credit!!
After a few weeks of subpar guests, Hot Ones finally landed the GOAT
Conan brought Gordon Ramsay energy
Oh yes! Conan's see through skin turning bright red 🌶️
😂 this was great!  The 3 of you were amazing!!
Finally Conan is on! So glad they finally got him!
Seeing Conan is the best.  Now, I am waiting for Steve Harvey on Hot Ones
I have been ecstatic since this has been announced and he didn’t disappoint! I wondered about the birthday thing so thanks for asking! Can’t wait to watch the show!!!
Conan > Fallon. I will die on that hill.
He looks like an alternate reality version of a successful Donald Trump
Wait. The last episode of 23? I thought you said the last episode was the last episode of the season.
The episode we've all been waiting for!!
Conan O'Brien forever one of the GOATs 🐐
Conan telling Sean he's a good interviewer without the wings & sauce pretense must have felt great.
The fact he's constantly saying he's fine but the sweat glistening on his face tells a different story hahahahah
Please, bring Keanu Reeves! Or Chuck Norris!
All this needs is a Jordan schlansky popping in during da bomb to talk to Sean and Conan about the efficacy of hot sauce on the digestive system.
Oh he wiling 😂😂😂😂
CHRIST HIS FACE LITERALLY WENT BRIGHT RED 🤯🤯🤯
Coco good🎉
I just started it and I already gave it a thumbs up! I know it's going to be a great one
A legend interviewing a legend
Conan, are you going to put your leftover wings on eBay?
STOP!  CONAN!
Conan is a madman
Conan is one of my favourite people on earth. ABSOLUTE LEGEND. Greetings from Poland.
How we never got matpat for the end of his YouTube run is an injustice.
CONANNNN
WHAT⁉️ here i thought Shakira was the last guest of the season as Sean said.  ohh you pulled a fast one...
The literal GOAT
Dropped by from Conan’s comment section to Hot Ones comments section for this king! So glad to finally see him in this show & excited for his new max show.
The wing in the pocket bit is too good 😂
Been watching Conan since the 90s.  Feel like the past 5-10 years he’s a bit too much, like he’s way overacting and his humor no longer comes off as natural.  It feels so forced. Maybe I’m just getting older and my sense of humor isn’t the same 🫤
lol Conan just pocketing the wings.
You gotta get Craig Ferguson on here at some point man, that would be awesome!
Conan 🔥
YES! :D
Sean getting praised by Harvard Community College educated Coco O'Brian on his interviewing skills. Deserved and extremely high praise. 😊 LOVE YOU COCOOOOOOO! My favorite ♥
YES!!! 🔥
This is everything ❤❤❤❤
Best one ever
The GOAT is finally on Hot Ones. What a great day for Conan and no-sellimg the wings of death 😅❤
Sean getting his interviewing props from Conan had to feel so amazing
FINALLY ❤❤❤
Im cracking up after each wing is placed in his jacket pocket.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can we get sona on also?
I miss conan and his gaming reviews 😢😢
OML HE DID NOT JUST DRINK FROM THE BOTTLE 😂😂😂😂 This man is insane
😂😂😂😂😂 5:30
GOATnan GOATbrian
The way I RAN to watch this
I love conaaannnn yippie
This will NEVER be like a chewing gum running out of flavour! Thank you Conan!😭
Conan is the best late guy there's been. His remotes were so funny, he was actually a good interviewer, and his animal segments were always great!
Heck Yes!! Conan O'brien FINALLY gets to have his Hot Ones Spotlight!! 💜
THE DREAM IS HERE WE’VE BEEN WAITING
As if this is a season finale
Plz bring Steve Harvey
Love how he still refuses to say Leno's name and calls him "The Other Guy".
the one we've been waiting for lfg!!!!
"There are few things more liberating in this life than having your worst fear realized..." 🐔🔥  -Conan O'Brien
thumbnail 😂
Thank you, Mila Kunis! You finally got him to come!
The first Man to disrespect Da Bomb and lived to tell the tale. LEGEND!!!😂
OH MY GOD
Conan is the GOAT
and that will be the most watched episode of all time
“Where did you go to medical school”  “Uhh uhh in 1998”
Conan is forever the 🐐
I just know I'm gonna watch this at least 100 more times
Conan is / was the best late night host and his comedy is gold.
I'm so happy right now. Merry Christmas, everyone.
What a surprise!
can’t believe they got tilda swinton on the show!!!
Sean has Nardwuar level of expertise with asking different questions and making people comfortable
He’s like the Maya Rudolph of men.
I LOVE CONAN
one of the best or THE best host in the history of television. honest, real, funny and someone who proved millions of ppl wrong during his beginning of his career.
Remember people: Don’t Blame Conan
3:10 Conan joining the list of celebrities impressed by Sean's research.
Who's this wise guy?
team coco🔥🔥🔥
Conando!!!!👍👍👍
How is he here, when I was just watching him on Fallon?
Thanks 4 this episode 🎉
Ahh finally ... was waiting for this 😂
Now this is an interview I am actually interested in
Not gonna lie, this is probably the funniest episode ever lol
Yes 🔥🔥 finally it has happened. I have waited years to see Conan on Hot Ones. This is glorious 🛐
This show has officially peaked!
God, Conan is funny. Thank you, Conan, for helping me find Finland on the map.
OH MY GODDD IVE NEVER CLICKED SO FAST
I can't believe this is happening.
This finale will go down in history as the best one. This is peak of peaks. I cannot see anyone else going even further.
For someone that has been here since almost the beginning, it’s wild to see how big Hot Ones has gotten.
Conan’s quick wit is unmatched.
i don't mean to disrespect the king, but... "what do you mean 'You People'?"
Yessssssssssssss❤
Best Hotones Ever
I love the way Conan uses comedy to overcome the effects of the sauces.
yooooo! <3
Truly the most important moment in all of internet history.
what is it with Americans saying they are Irish how many generations has your family lived in America, you're American 😆or im Gunna start calling myself a Viking
Noice
Oooh! Did Mila make it happen? :D
Conan with the Hot Pocket
FINALLY IT HAS HAPPENED! I remember requesting CoCo years ago. THANK YOU Hot Ones!!!!
Have been waiting years for this one!! Conan is the funniest man on earth
Made my day.
Oooooooh Yesss🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
Conan brought his doctor 😂  “He’s not the best, but he’s affordable”
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH MYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY GOOOODNESSSSS! THE ABSOLUTE LEGEND, COCOOOOOO! You have made me SO SO HAPPY TODAY!
Starting off strong bringing Dr. José Arroyo
As i black Scottish who married a white Irish.
I’ve never pressed on a hot ones video so fast
Didn’t even start yet but so happy he seems like such a great guy :)
Start of season 24 should have MatPat now that he’s “retired”
I've always loved Conan as a late night host. Even in this interview, he had me cracking up. A part of me was hoping we would see a different side to Conan, so now I'm not sure if he ever "turns off" the performer in him.
No $##@#@ way!   CONAN!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The best person to let Bill Burr unleash all his power.
I really shouldn’t be watching this in public 😂
Just Coco being Coco, with a pocket full of bones😂
Let's GOOOOOOOOO!!!

From one legend to another.

Our prayers been heard 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I HAVE WAITED YEARS
Conan is awesome. He seems like a cool dude to hang out with.
out of state 😂😂
This show is awesome and always has been
Conan is a legend. I'll watch/listen to anything he does for the rest of time.
Sigh.. another full season without the Supernatural boys;  Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki  ~sad face~
Israel is not a country it's a military base
Great guest for a finale
THE MAN THE MYTH
2 of the best together ... Was about time!
two great forces colliding.
Next time Conan is on it needs to be him and Jordan Schlansky, like Keenan and Peele did
Conan O'Brien? Whaaa? Never clicked into an episode so fast.
The goat!!
I can't wait to see Conan fall in love with Sean
Starting to watch now and know already this is gonna be hysterical.  Conan is a brilliant comedian & king of self deprecation
COCKAROO!!!
Here early 😂
Conan: "I'm not scared of your wings." Also Conan: "I brought my doctor."
Coney!!!!!!
I grew up with Conan. He's my hero. And I was in tears watching this. Best episode ever.
Conan !!! I can’t wait to watch his new travel show, absolutely loved his talk show and now podcast - his comedy is unmatched. What a brilliant man/mind❤
Cheers to season 23!
The only way this episode could be better is if Sona and Matt joined in too
Wished upon a star for this! Also OJ just died like minutes before this video got posted, I’m sure Conan will be mad that OJ is pulling focus lol
Ive never click on a thumbnail so fast
CONAN!!! Yaaaaassssss! Clicked on this so fast.
Praying he survives this 🙏🙏🙏
Now that's somebody to close out the season with. Finally!
The white whale! Congrats Hot Ones!
I've been waiting for this episode since I discovered Hot Ones years ago. This is the perfect platform for Conan's shenanigans.
Oh wow I always thought Conan was about 5’7”
FINALLY

I love Conan O’brien!
The man, the myth, the Legend
The best to do it in the modern era!
