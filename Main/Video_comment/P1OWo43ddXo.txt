Scarra: "I want to see the heart rate of everyone on the couch." Couch people heart rate rising higher than the chair one.
miss this type of content
3:15 I RECOGNIZE THAT MUSIC ANYWHERE, YOU NEED TO PARRY THE GUARDIAN
Lily has the most colorful personality 😂❤
Michael should've js kissed Lily smh
5:21 “is that a fist” poki you of anyone should know
LMAO 5:29
at 4:58 notice how all the girls cover their faces and the guys keep looking...
10:27 HOLY SHIT YVONNE IS HAVING A HEART ATTACK 😭😭😭😭
Poki : I'm relaxed.   Brodin: -speaks only a few words-  Poki's heart rate: -goes up-
"How do you get a man's blood flowing?"  - DisguisedToast
toast went full pornhub mode on scarra 😂
11:55 just a little wizard showing everyone porn
Polk was kinda freaky in this
Toast deals with so much we don't know of so he just never reacts..they should have brought Fanfan
7:10 I would've never expected someone who isn't michael to suggest this first lmao
i did not expect toast, of all people to fucking do that
boys will be boys
This must have Part 2 because this is super hillarious 🤣🤣
7:46 she bought this for her purse imagine being an attacker and the girl pulls out a taser but closer her eyes and screams before she even turns it on
how come they act like they never watch p**n or like fifteen years old
I think it would have been better if there was a no touching rule enforced. Yvonne waxing Lilly was WILDE!
if you haven't watched porn with your friends, you ain't that close. 😂 it was so funny watching prn with them. we all laughed and found out what each person was into.
Okay, VERY off-topic, but like.... where did y'all get those blankets! I need one! It's my favorite color combination, and it looks so fluffy! I require this in my life.
6:23 all the guys quiet while poki talking about how big a man D is 😂
1:51 you are not stressed you’re just fat its one of the reason for that heart rate reading
Anderson Thomas Moore Anthony White Ronald
LONELY ROLLING STARRRRRR
why is poki so here
为什么会有成人网站。太奔放了吧
Could've defeated toast by just forcing him to play any sort of video game with yvonne.🤣🤣
5:23 best line
3:34 gun shooting gremlin 😂
nobody talking about michael and lily kissing at the start🥺
Michael and Lily kissing at the start of the video is so heartwarming
I swear michael was about to bring out a tazer
11:12 lily looks like an evil wizard here lol
Brooooo no way LILY WAS THAT ONE GIRL OF THE MELODICA VIDEO!!😱😱😱
9:25
Brodin thinking about poki's what if: Well at least I probably wouldnt have to edit as much.
I appreciate bodine trying to blur the hub but we all knew by color XD
in another universe  Micheal: ingcrese blood flow means increase heart rate right? and the best way to do that is fear, let's try best gore
Scarra: what's your favourite category? Yvonne: okay! BYE!!!
I've watched this like thousands of times but. Did I just see Michael and Lily kiss in the intro?.
I would just like to say on average my heart rate varies by 100 each day so this dose not make sense because it just is them naturally changing and the variability is from doing nothing
Toast is so smart🧠
Poki main is so unfunny that it's kinda cringe 🤣
All Michael needs to make the girls’ heart rates go up is an invention that moves 😂
Why is poki so horny for the first 10 minutes lmao
My average BMP is 107 which is bad :/
I think scara’s heart rate was flawed because people were stressing him
Toast does not get any blanket
10:39 2 year old video but hey better late than never, the first (non tutorial) puyo battle theme in puyo puyo 1
Why is poki so sensual in this shoot…
My resting is like 50, but then sometimes I get to like 200 when I work out.
Toast " Holy shit, pokis having a heart attack!! " I died😂
I can't believe toast did that
Ngl some these things look like torture tactics
1:40 song
this video is chaos and i love it so much always makes me laugh
Everyone: Porn!! Michael: I must clap
Ok, but we’re all in the same page that Micheal would be the real life jigsaw if he had the chance right?
0:51
idk i would see pokimanes dark side in this video
Man wheres the two girl one cup
What was the "video of someone poki doesnt like very much"
Lily isnt savred of taser cause michael is his boyfriend
brodin needs a raise he has alot of cool video ideas and is a great cameraman. He deserves more recognition for his work.
Toast the real one for putting porn on lols 😂😂😂
I love how a large part of this was "OTV reacts to: Pron"
5:10 yep, that's phub. Lmao
Toast just casually showing porn, feels fitting
2023 present i can't believe this video was uploded in 2021 time is flying
I've seen no one talking about it but I find it really cute that DaVinky just jumps into Poki's lap expecting love and attention. Is it just me?
My favorite part is when poki's heart rate spikes to 137 and toast says "holy shit poki's having a heart attack" 💀
Wouldve played the old clips of pokimane saying the N word or the Void disstrack
10:12 I do this to kill ants, honestly the most fun thing until you burn yourself then do it again
For anyone wondering (since I did) the intro song is “Lonely Rolling Star” from Katamari Damacy
what was the music at the beginning
Pokimane the god of gaslighting
i loved in the beginning how they were trying to act like they dont normally watch it after toast put on porn
What the hell was poki doing?
Song name in the intro?
Can someone tell me the name of the song that was played at 1:34
what was yvonne's video yvonne is deeply ashamed of?
9:23
13:26
3:23
11:00
If I'm not wrong this vid has an age restriction, so I can't watch it before cause I was just 17 yo. And it really triggered me cause I was just so curious. 1 year later I'm back as an 18 yo and can finally sleep in peace
Can someone give me the title of the intro song?
12:04
Yo CIA hire my boi Michael for torturing
I love that Michael tried sensory overload but didn’t really work much. 8:24
Toast 😳
I love how rolling lonely star is in the background :)
I'm newish to OTV still and I always felt bad for Yvonne for being the butt of most jokes and situations (ie: condiments girl) - this was her time for revenge
Does anyone know the song in the beginning 1:20
dont swear dont use God's name in vain it should only be used to address God. Dont find pleasure in sexual stuff unless its with someone in marriage
anyone know the song at 1:30?
BRUH THE "IS THAT A FIST"
i typted ok bye into Ph nothing came up
this is fun cause, if i did this, i reckon i'd get highest, as my heart rate can go from 55 to 180 soooo
What is this song please somebody? 13:52
Micheal with tasers is literally 90%of why i started watching otv in the first place. Every time he got his hands on one of those electrifying little boxes i always crack up
Anyone know who the video of someone poki doesn't like Is cus I'm curious
I mean this with all due respect and not to be rude but poki was deffo h*rny in this shoot the constant innuendos and s*x references from her she obv was which isnt fun when I think about things like that as I'm always thinking outside the box and never in good ways
*taser activates* everybody except michael gets scared    moments later everyone is learning the joy of tasers.
At least they can say they watched p**n as a group
I don't care for dick sizes when watching porn, I'm too busy focusing on the jerking off part. Lol
SONIC UNLEASHED SPANGONIA DAY TIME HUB MUSIC
I am really good at scaring people and dont really easely get scared. It would be fun go be in a situation line that
cussed in the first 5 mins no more money sad
Tasers
Where do you buy you're vaders?
What’s the intro song??
Lol 😂😂😂😂😂
Just around people raises mine. 55 chillin. An up to 120 during pysio walking on tread mill next to someone monitoring it
0:00
1:45    That ain't stress my man.   Your fa-*Blocked*
All I could think about was *I want those blankets, I want to know where they got those blankets they look so warm and fluffy--*
I want to see the entire video uncensored
Was a chair for Yvonne not in the budget?
Nice aim brodin
Toast why
There is so much screaming and laughing and torture in this video and personally I LOVE IT keep up the good work
i think poki was just horni during the shoot wtf XD
My resting heart rate is 104 and uh, i would win
whats the intro song???
Scarras comment 🤣🤣 6:51
I feel like Michael is crazy but wouldn't actually hurt someone other than himself, but I was scared with Poki holding a taser
4:20 Scarra sounds like he’s  screaming in Yvonnie’s Voice
Does anyone know the outro song???
Michael's so powerful he can control his heart rate is this for defence just instant heart attack
of course Michael make a flametrower
No one: Michael implementing actual torture methods:
I'm wondering who the person in the video is with poki tbh
poki was in the mood ngl
did you see how exited was at this: 07:16
4:26 when Yvonne and Scarra yelled at the same time it looks like Scarra screamed like that XD
i miss this otv
2 girls 1 cup wouldve done the job easily :)
9:17 poki got a WAGON
Anyone know the name of the song in the intro?
To answer Poky’s question if guys with “small” packages, yeah no that’s a guy code that only we guys should keep. 😏
sounded homey… yep, auckland. lol.
When poki said “I don’t think things are supposed to open like that” when toast went on you know where 😂
So who was in the video that poki didn't like and what video was yvonne ashamed of?
LOL THAT FATA$$ INCEL ONE 4 YEARS FROM FINNA DYIN
4:50 TOS TOS
I have been meaning to say this for awhile but I don't believe that Michael is from Hawaii, I believe he is actully from florida.
Can somebody give me a hand and tell me what the song in the outro and in the beginning is. It sounds really nice, but I can't seem to find a name.
When toast said "now I'm just sad" felt that
Michael: "M E L O D I C A      VID EO" Lily: "NO-"
1:30 this is amazing
10:57😂😂
I wonder who that someone was that was shown to poki..
I love how when poki was trying to “charm” lily, lily was instead calmed by her presence
TOAST GOT THEM GRIPPAS OUT
Both.
Yvonne: * Tazer noises followed by several babbling shrieks*
I think poki has some....stuff she needs to go take care of...
THE PERSON POKI DOESNT LIKE WHO WAS THE VIDEO OF
Wait isn't controlling your heart rate normal? 🤔
At 7:57 is that a video of John/ MasaYoshi?
toast is an actual madlad lmaoooooo
Why'd this turn into the homies watching porn together
Whats the name of the song?
I can easily win i take adderall😂
Welcome back to Michael abuses lilly for views
1:15 pen plushee in the background "i have some things u will be fucking with each other with"
4:46 Toast with a brilliant move
5:56 sounds like peter's notif alert in twitch LUL
was the video poki doesn't like fedmyster
I like how at 12:16 it sounds like he's referring to himself as a failed creation.
It would have been better to take them bc it can increase the heart rate alot
WHY WAS THE BGM SO GOOD THIS VIDEO, I WAS REWATCHING OTV VIDEOS AND THIS ONE HAD LONELY ROLLING STAR FROM KATAMARI, PUZZLE PLANK GALAXY FROM SMG2, AND THE PUYO PUYO BATTLE BGM??
michael is just rick sanchez at this point
6:56 make sure never too trust Lily with a actual gun
0:19 I NEED THOSE BLANKETS
Lol
i dont know why but lily in this video looked like the average asian grandma
Just get a cae battery and red goes to red black goes to black then just spark near him
when toast loaded the porn everyone looked away michael: STARES
This is how
What is the song thats playing at the end card called??
6:55 Focus on Micheal and Lily in the background. You can see Micheal's face of fear and concern as Lily shoots the thing near her face.
What is the music ?
Who editit this video.... the audi is so bad... stop making the music lauder then the voices omg....
7:56 what is it?
poki is psycho like she was on the ninja video
Who was the person poki hated
they should just show them getting a 5 star in genshin
toast pulled the kanye west technique
this is why toast is the best character in this Anime
Yvonne: AMBULANCE NOISES!!!!!
I don’t remember watching it but apparently I have so now I have to opportunity to experience it for the first time again
Got everyone beat. 211bpm baby! …my heart had problems
My God, Yvonne's constant scream is legit hurting my ears, Jesus Christ
Michael dies inside when lily hugs him
Do we know who it is poki doesn’t like very much?
7:12 hey... that's micheal's shtick.
my mom: give me your tablet. my heart rate: "500 beats per sec"
Alternative title: Who can go in to Cardiac arrest the best.
How about a video where Brodin gets the punishment instead? hahah
Anybody know what that intro/ending song is?
Now I'm so curious about all the blurred or not shown stuff like what did poki even do at 4:20
Lmao
Content of the year: otv freaking out over porn.
Legging 😂😂😂😂😂😂
what is the song that plays during the outro?
has the video become not age restricted because of the youtube age restriction controversy or is the de-age-restriction completely unrelated
Poki is always naughty.
why do i feel like they showed poki a video of fed
10:56
5:33
Second time seeing this and I just noticed when they explained it in the very beginning you can see micheals expression and just know what's he's thinking
Bro why does toast have those absolute dogs out
I feel like some pancake slapped into some super ultimate extra extreme flipped multiversal *SPACE* in comparison to this YT Channel  there now in hell way I'll be able to join Offline TV t^t, it just became for what WAS in my pov (hopefully others to) a really good .. chill .. fun .. happy ^^ ... Place -_- .....  And well but now is a supraextrimi convoluted complicated multiverse microwave background 2.0  Hope mentality cures, cuz after this overly powerful peice of text, my mentality is still absolutely down t^t
Anyone know what japanese song is used in the intro music and outro music?
Hi
"Every girl looks better ina sun dress" line from atmosaphere i thought when i saw poki
Are you really watching porn by yourself.  No I'm with the science team!!!
you should do it with tubbo and mention tubnet lol
Michael should have tried  " The Shepherds Tone"
anyone know the song that was playing at the start?
What’s the song at the beginning
i love yvonne so much her screaming is the best
fds
Does anybody know the name of the outro song? It sounds so familiar
I'd watch what poki suggested
This whole thing reminds me of the scene in The IT Crowd where Denhim tests Jess if she's stressed
what is the outro song?
Dude 13:33
Sir! This terrorist is tight lipped! What are we going to do?!  ....... Send in Michael Reaves
Can y’all do this again but add John, Jodi, and Sydney? I feel like John, Michael, and Poki would be a lethal combo🤔 also why the hell wasn’t Brodin in the chair!!??
It isn't a surprise that the.. Hefty guy had the highest hart rate. But it isn't good. I hope he improves his health soon.
ik this was like a year ago but why is no one talking about how scary poki can be? like that’s nightmare stuff right there.💀
Lily looks traumatised after what toast searched up
ﾠﾠﾠﾠ
say what you want, but toast has the balls to just open porn for everyone to see
I love Michael’s reaction to porn, being so interested into a leg
F’k pornhub,I’d just start stripping
i have heartproblems so my heart rate spikes to 250 bpm every day >:D
Imagine the most replayed part of the video being pokimane's ass    I'm disappointed in all of you...
Any gd or osu players can relate to having a 130+ heart bpm because of the stress of the end of the map lol
13:37 Michael:  *" I didn't know fists can do... "*
Jesus the porn💀💀🤣
Who is the person Pokimane doesn't like very much?
What's the intro song?
Tbh, toast going straight to pornhub was the most expected thing ever
Pulls up video of someone polo doesn't like. Me oh shit it's fed.
this is actually my favorite otv vid of all time
What is with the most reaplayed
BTMC gets to 194 so he is better
Pull out the one man one jar to permanently scar and get sombody to quit
Anybody know the song in the beginning??
OTV is basically just them watching porn together and tazing each other
Scarra=hypertension
0:01 look at lily and michael :((
It's cute how oblivious and innocent they are to the world of porn... When looking at some weird kinks out there, what they saw was entry level stuff at best.
I'm surprised they didn't show fake pokimane corn
WAIT ITS GOING DOWN *thats what she said*
Is it me or is Michael becoming like Mcjuggernuggets character "Pyscho Kid". 12:14
IS THAT A FIST????????????
"The maniac has a fucking saw,"-some SWAT officer, Payday 2
I like how yvone have no trigger discipline lol
Is it weird to say I'm somewhat disappointed that no one tried porn bloopers?
So I now know why this was age restricted
Scarra is obese. That’s why his resting heart rate is 99
5:51 "legging?!" I fing love michael😂😂🖤🖤🖤
10:24 what videos? WHAT VIDEOS?
0:02 get a room
The fact that kids watch this
The fact that Phub was used on everyone is 😂
"Scara won't be able to trust my aim" as the BotW Guardian music starts playing fucking murdered me!
The three asian men listening to poki talking abt d*cks*
eat a salad for once scarra
Let's do this again but they try to stay calm under pressure as Brolin torture eme
11:13  Everyone else: screaming MIchael: tHaT IS sUS
Are you seriously watching porn by yourself? No I'm watchin with the BOOOOYS
4:46 Toast: increased heartrate means increased blood flow, so how do we get a mans blood flowing? I instantly knew where they were going after he said that
which anime song is at start and end ?
What’s the music in background in the beginning
small copck
7:54 who, ninja??
Part 2
Aaa..yes. The Kardia app.
Mom!!!! Reeves broke the Geneva suggestion again
Let there be NTR
Wasn't this called "Tazers & Flames"?
I see why 9:17 is the most replayed
The boss music starts playing when Yvonne gets a rubber band gun XD.
outro song?
Do more of this game
Commenting because I love this team.  great stuff, well done, keep it up!
OTV watches porn
Lol now we know Yvonne's screams are all legitimate her heart rate doesn't lie 😂😂😂😂 I always thought she was acting at least a little bit just for humor but you can't fake spiking heart rate lol. She is ACTUALLY always so scared 😂😂.
I love getting videos recommended 11 months after they come out.
Is that a fist?
I like Brodins uchiha cap
Does anyone know what that outro song is??
TOAST WITH GIGABRAIN PLAY
oh age restrictions were removed from this vid lol, idk why
5:10 I CAN TELL WHAT THAT IT WITH THE BLUR 😭😭😭
6:58 me and my uncle
Welcome to the 3rd installment of OfflineTV Running Man.
ah  so i guess ph comcast was usefull
I think the first one got deleted by YouTube idk why and here we are that they doing another one
Who is “video of someone poki doesn’t like”? Fed?
please someone anyone my life depends on it what is the song at 1:29 PLEASWE
Yes
I CAN FINALLY WATCH THIS. CONGRATULATIONS TO 3M SUBSCRIBERS, OTV! WOHOOO! 🥳

TOAST WENT ONTO THE FORBIDDEN HUB......
Poki really went from 🫦💋😘 to 😈🔪 real quick lol
What’s the song in the intro and outro?
+ the one in 11:27
guys who knows the name of the vid in 10:25
Sucks that this video got age restricted
YOUTUBE WHY
9:14
me: * sees that the video is age restricted * “oh what could they possibly do?” *5 minutes in* “ah i see”
poki saying ,"is that a fist" is very ironic considering she was fisting herself in fed's dms
7:08 Months of torture (Michael's videos) made her finally snap
poki's naughty. whoever gonna be her bf is lucky
5:09 ah no wonder i got a warning for this video ..
I don't know but I think Michael and lily are j*rk*ng off each other jk I'm so sorry guys
lmao there showing horn pub
9:16
nice
I wonder what is this song (from intro and outro) from? Because I wanna put it on my Playlist
Can we get another one of these now that there are new members
Actually I have an idea, hot or cold but is porn categories and the higher the heart rate the better the category
I cant wait for pokimane to have another breakdown and fuck off the channel again for a while. That was the best content they ever put out
p*** ads: are you seriously watching alone? OTV: 5:15
9:24 best of the best
I think we all know the video of "someone that poki doesn't really like"
On today’s episode of otv: Cardiac Arrest
To those curious, the intro/ending song used was "Lonely Rolling Star" from the game Katamari Damacy !
I personally live this video because of Brodin’s sadistic nature, i mean people getting cardiac arrest is entertaining.
Poki is a psycho and Michael is a pyro
I THIUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD CONTROL MY HEART RATE!!!!!! I USED TO FUCK WITH DOCTORS IN THE HOSPITAL
Age restricted
this shows how bad mine is lol
Ain't no way Toast did that 💀
4:44
What’s the music in the video?
did you know that when two people are in love their heart rates sinc up
LILY JUST CASUALLY SCROLLING THROUGH PORN IN A SHARK COSTUME I CANT
just spent 10 minutes looking for this vid because youtube won't show it to me because im 17
Is i was thinking of toast otv intro
If Michael had just shouted "CRACKHEAD" at everyone with a taser, they would've freaked out
Is this the only OTV video that was age restricted? lol
BRODIN SHOULD GET THE MOVING EARS THING WHERE THE EARS MOVE IF THE PERSON WEARING THE EARS IS NERVOUS
Hole
Lily: Does this work? *fires* Micheal: Y e s
What's the intro music?
Why age-restricted??
0:02 anyone else notice Lily kiss Michael here?
Toast knows whats up
This pretty much me and the boys watching random shit on 3am
Michael is the one friend that makes a lot of war crime jokes and stuff to the point its concerning
oh my god this was such a fun one
Scarra: calm Everybody on the sofa: *never seen a porn before*
Someone say the name of the bg song
Hm I wonder why this is age restricted
Michael just employed psychological warfare
Thats illegal toast 😂😂
Intro song?
7:28 bottom left anyone?
The person blurred in that video of the guy that pokimsne doesn't like looks like Michael Reeves
Give micheal any source of physical pain anyone's heart rate will go up
What is that amazing intro song?
Anybody know what the ending song is called?
Toast is a cultured man !!!! Respect lol 😂
michael is just a torture master.
if poki was a man she'd be imprisoned  <----
8:15 huh😂
6:57 Mykull worried about lily when she about to shot herself.
Why did I have to verify my age for this video   Edit: I’ve finished the video and I guess the age verification is right
I BEG YOU WHAT'S THE TITLE OF THE OPENING/ENDING SONG!!??
How age restricted
but I'm 18 tho
damn I can watch it too young
Alternate Title: OfflineTV tries to arouse each other with porn.
4:24  Nobody: Scarra: *screams in Yvonne*
What heart rate monitor is that? I’m guessing some Bluetooth device and android phone being screen shared
The Song is "Lonely Rolling Star" for those who want to know
e
TOAST WAS SO UNAFFECTED BY THE PRON HELP
i deadass spent 10 minutes making a fake account just to watch this
I like how Poki and Yvonne start joking about what guys watch, the others just stand there and Lily is just traumatized
Scarras got an advantage his heart's already working harder than everyone elses
Is that a fist!!!
No punishment?!?! :O
Age restricted video, tasers and flames in the title, you know its a video with micheal.
WAS LISTENING TO THIS WHILE PLAYING BOTW. 3:13 GAVE ME A DAMN HEART ATTACK
Toast dong something NOT appropriate xD
Peepeee Pooopooo
noice
does anyone know the song in the background throughout the whole video ?? (1:30)
6:57  Lily: “wait does this work”  Michael: “yes”
Who else went to watch the video of when toast joined otv?
I heard somewhere that when two people are meant to be their heartbeats will synchronize, seems it was right 👀
me: hm, why is this age restricted?  toast: haha risque go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
"Age restricted video (based on community guidelines)" bruh, i watched this like a month ago, what do you mean.
Alternative Title: OfflineTV Members Mentally Torture Each Other for Content  I think this is every video though
THERES TWO HAHHAHHA 3:32 love it when they do cuts off Ynovone
‌
Michael is a god of pure chaos.
intro song name pls
I love all the girls hiding from the pron and Michale is pulling out his magnifying glass to examine it further
Bro I had to change my age to 18 just to watch this lmao
Can someone explain me the four amigops thing?
10:04 Yvonnes isn't scared of the fire she is actually just terrified of Michael

Poki being hella freaky😳😳😳

whats the outro music?
What song was playing at 1:34
With those glasses, Michael looks like a cracked Harry Potter
Rip offlinetv logo
8:40 fuck I'M GETTING SENSORY OVERLOAD!!!!
Best way to give yourself a heart attack, just scream for as long and as loud as possible until you pass out.
They couldve tried putting up a video of a horror game or somethin lol
4:46 Toast: I'ma do what's called a pro gamer move rn
I love how everyone kept sneaking peeks when Michael pointed out the legging
What is that intro song? I really like it
Anybody know the intro song??
This is Michel’s forte, torturing people and scaring them
9:34
I heard psychopaths and sociopaths are very good at controlling their heart rate.
The first half of this video is just the group showing how h o r n I quarantine has made them and its funny as shit. Good to know their human too 😂😂😂
.
Scarra:"so whats your favorite category?"
The squeak at the beginning woke my dog up she was prepared to kill 😂😂
5:37 screams of terror
Poki true nature came out in this video
poki dirty minded😮
yvonne with the cardboard gun ad she popes out with two  i swear yvonne make me laugh all the time
What is the song from the start?
Michaels face
Poki is such a treasure like wtf.
I'm sure the editors had fun with this one LOL
I'm a student, and I'm here       I like it even at this age.
Intro is Katamari Damacy: Lonely Rolling Star
Just tell the person. You are the closer for a league final match,and we need a triple no matter what,and with 18 spectators watching him...
Those are rookie numbers! My bp is 180 over 130 and I'm on 2 bp medications!
This got age restricted pog
Poki getting Yvonne back with the taser is the best
My heartrate when I play geometry dash: 📈📈📈📈📈📈 Only chads know
5:11 Pokimanes foot is exposed
Omg this is literally torture
Toast is a champion
The fact that Yvonne has like little waddle when she runs
why the heck is this one age-restricted??
This video got age restricted.
9:16
Heart attack speed run
Poki on coffee is absolutely terrifying.
The casualness in Scarra’s voice asking Yvonne’s favorite category at the end is too funny 😭 like he’s just asking her about her favorite pizza topping or something
First song title pleasee
7:55 fedmyster?
Ahh, now I know why the video is age-restricted. Dammt Toast
Michael really went all out to torture his girlfriend!!! LOL
"This video may be inappropriate for viewers"
OfflineTV should have a challenge where they just relax and just chill because you know what! the crew deserves it.   if I was in their shoes I would just die,  the whole crew are legends.
omg I got sensory overload when I have much fun with my friends and my friends little made a tick tok of me losing my sheet xD
>mfw my resting heart rate is 120 due to hypertension
This is perfect they are all psychos accept toast, surprisingly
Every vid with micheal mixed with tazer is great,i think at least
Whats the intro music? At 1:30
What is the song playing at 1:30?
poki is a sociopath                       you really read this??
fun fact, my phone ring tone is the Zelda BOTW Guardian piano melody  when they played that song i literally spun my head all around looking for my phone and then saw that my phone screen was blank lol
still cant beat el goblino's 178bpm tho monkaW
Bring Sykkuno!!!!!!!
Hearing poki say "is that a fist?!" made me lose my shit
Are they all watching Hub together?
Lily looks like Sarah from Telltale Game’s Walking Dead (Season 2)
1:32  Does anyone know that the music/song is?
...why is this age-restricted? Fuck you, YouTube.
does anyone know the name of the song in the intro
Bruh, why'd I have to verify my age to watch this vid?
tbh lily's cracked at melodica
"Someone poki doesn't like" was it fedmyster because he leaked the truth?
Toast and Michael were so good at this
Toast look like hes being held at gunpoint lmao
Every Simps Dream:9:11 to 9:18
This video is gonna get demonetized ngl just for me
Damn they put fed on blast even tho they blured him
Katamari music makes me happy.
Hello rn
They were so mean to lily 😭😭
The title should be toast making everyone uncomfortable
7:30  Heart rate: *yvonnie*
Everyone: watching the video  Me: “hello brodin” 😼
i havent even gotten past the intro and now im imagining michael punching someone
”I have a number of objects over here and you guys can use to fuck with eachother”  Brodin is SUS
What’s the ending song?
😂👍👍
i think ik what yyvonnes "deeply ashamed" video was -_-
Sauce?
straight up cia torture techniques
Gamers and their fucking heart rates Christ. Go out running for once in your life. Resting heart rate of 73?
Ballz by aqualime ._.
This was pure chaos, I love it.
Michael reeves with the yikes shirt we love to see it
What’s the ending song it slaps
what song did they use in the intro?
Yvonne : gets tazer Michael: visible excitement
Just realized sum... Everyone was having a hard time getting Lily's heart rate up with tasers, a bunch of sound, a kiss, yet only Toast was successful, and he didn't even get up. He succeeded with just 17 words.
Yvonne is good to scare people and her self too.
probably was a video of Fed, someone that Poki led on for years. And the whole drama happened.
E
Micheal is like the main character from guns akimbo when he has tazers
Does anybody know what song they used for the intro and outro?
this video is very concerning for their health
Is this Brodin training them to be prospective torturers and sadists
legGING?
I love the Katamari music
Insane vid! Enjoyed it!
"the couch can verbally abuse you" that sounds like a fever dream
Damn Scarra a resting heartrate of 100.. you should uhh look into that
When poki had the tazer to yyvone she was getting ptsd from the tazer hide and seek
Just watching davinky begging everybody to sit on their lap makes me want a davinky for myself
I swear to god poki is a fucking Sadist
Poki at 0:45 Me: exercise
I liked Disguised toast thinking
Toast straight to ole reliable 😂
I thought they said everything goes so I was about to comment “so this is the only time se***l harassment is permitted?” But apparently they didn’t
I would have just gotten hard with the norp
And people say it is not messed up…. She did a lot of s** stuff in a joking manner you could say she wasn’t joking
Goddamn it toast. That I was just what I expected from you I love it.
7:29 I can describe one word in this scene                               CHAOS
Outro song plssss my guy
Intro song?
Michel is corrupting them, Yvonne bought a taser. That she’s still traumatized by
Toast goes immediately for the throat lmao
They’ve absorbed so much electricity that at this point you can’t even restart their heart
For the scarra one what’s wrong? And why did toast ask Yvonne if she ever watched poem
Glad I saw this before it got restricted
9:18
Does anyone know what device they used to measure the heart rate?
TOAST DIDN'T
900000000 iq toast
7:57 wait who the one pokimane don’t like?? i can’t figure it out
Me casually having 100 and 200 smething while running :d No im not fat xd
toast just mentally scarred everyone xD
Make a part 2 of this, but invite GuitarHeroStyles and none of you are loosing
Everyone talking about Toast being horni but Poki was just consistently suggestive on this video. I'm not complaining but damn, woman, chill!
I swear poki and lilly are a thing
i watch this video every week
Literally everyone else: AHHHHHHHHH **covers face with blanket Michael: 5:54
Lily’s turn was just torture lmao 😂
5:10 trust toast to be the one that doesn’t give a shit
why is this age restricted now
I would win this, my heart goes up to 148bpm just by standing up
Who is the person poki doesn’t like
poki is seriously horni
i dont know how to feel
why tf this age restricted?
5:11 watcha watching
What is the song at the intro?
0:09 yeah I'd watch every video like it was a sitcom
Michael used Sensory Overload - Special Forces do that. Michael - have you trained special forces?
11:02 just pull up all the images schlatt has sent pokimane in dms. Lots of amogus p*rn there
Who is the person that poki doesn’t like very much at 7:54 ?
Anyone know what the outro song was?
Pokémon.
4:51 I got a bad feeling about this 😅
The only videos I could think of during this entire video were shock videos and now it’s the only thing I can think of. ;-;
When Lilly said we thinking about firing you my heart dropped
I think the way Micheal can control his heart rate is thinking about dominating the world with an army of beer pissing robots and getting excited about the thought.
Poki kinda fruity on this one ngl
Michaels wearing Eddie’s merch
Wait did they change some portions of the video???
Toast is so freaking attractive 😮‍💨
Does ennybody know the name of the song at the beginning?
“Is that fist” as if  she doesn’t know what that is
Yvonne just screaming the whole time 🤣
Intro song please?🙏
Whose video did they show to poki?
i love how most of these type of videos is just torture lmao
Whats the intro song?
Was that imsudas voice? In the back of the wax strip partt?
I'm just in love with this squad fam 💙
fun fact, when you are around people you love your resting heart rate slowly changes to match theirs. micheal and lily's heart rates were probably the same because they love eachother. and that is wholesome as fuck
I Fucking Loved This One!
"Are you seriously watching porn all by yourself?" NO I'M WATCHING IT WITH OFFLINETV! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I noticed micheal and lily kissed in the first few seconds
does scarra have tachycardia?
Michael should have acted like he was gonna propose to lily
whats the intro/outro song?
I don’t want to be that guy but Yvonne won in being healthy.
When that Guardian sound effect came on when Yvonne had the gun i got scared and reached for my ancient arrows
id try 1-man-1-jar
My natural heart rate is 97
Spokie noooo...
I didnt get why lily is "annoyed" at toast saying that he is part of the amigops
anyone know the name of the ending song?
What was the song used?
someone gets a heart attack everyone else "WOOO how are you doing it"
At 1:30 does anyone know the song?  My crush likes these type of songs so id appreciate if u help me
Micheal is scary
bruh what
I came from watching the btmc raise my sword play and realized it’s not normal to have a constant heart rate of 150+
God I want to enter that set with my soundboard for two reasons  One: I have a natural talent of being way quieter than most humans, and as such I walk very quietly  Two: My soundboard has a Titan warhorn, one of the loudest possible noises on the internet when correctly mixed. Imagine that shit all of a sudden blaring from right next to your ear.  I also have Cloaker noises
W video
Why do I feel like I should be rolling a giant ball around and collecting people and buildings and things up in an ever increasing ball that then becomes a star? Hmmm. :)
ah yes, MONETIZED TORTURE
whats the song names yo use? Could you put them in the description? i would like to know because they sound really nice
1:45 that you're a bit unhealthy ? 80 is the top that's considered still healthy.
If Lily just got real close and lovey with Michael, he'd flush and his heart would have gone through the roof
I came here to watch Michael be a psychopath this is not what I expected, am I disappointed no
The katamari music bein vibes at the start :3
11:15 God she looks like such a goblin I love it
Jokes on yall my resting heart rate is over 130     I'm also only 22 I'm fucked
legging lagoon
I know how to bring my own heart rate down dont ask
Age Restriction....
Y'all know what a boss hogg is?
0:01 Michael and Lily are so adorable!
If Poki kissed me my heart rate would go vroooooooooooooommmmmm
TOAST JUST OPENING THE PH	 LMAOOO
Toast is a genius
Premium user
Since when was Pokimane this sexual? I don't remember every joke she made being about sex...
Still convinced that Michael’s actually a sleeper cell agent and that’s why he immediately went for sensory overload. The years of torture experience truly shined in this video
What’s the song from the intro
its age restricted...
I lost my shit at "IS THAT A FIST!?".
Michael looked so proud of Yvonnie when she pulled out her own taser
Are we gonna ignore the fact that lily kissed Michael in the start of the video
repost
Just think of their average heart rate as their school grade, Scarra would have the the highest one and Yvonne would just be on the passing grade lol
Should have shown Toast his Kpop dance videos
Meanwhile the army taking notes 😂
Pokimane saying “is that fist?!” In confusion and disgust, yet slightly interested had me dying
"I love being a part of the four amigops" LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo
why did no one try blackmailing them into hyperventilating, one way or another the heart rate goes up either due to pressure or them hyperventilating
Unethical
yeah, Yeah now you just gave someone an idea to make shitty nsfw cosplay of the Offline tv gang in an extremely nsfw activity all together
I’m worried about scarra.
Why didn't anyone think about tickling their feet (not that Im into this kind of stuff 🤮)
4:51
What's the into song
Why does that facecam of the person poki doesn’t like kinda look like sykunno
anyone talking about the cute kiss at the beginning behind brodin's head or what
2:00 I haven’t heard that name in a while
What is the music that playing, I want to know
WTF I just had to age verify using a credit card! Edit: ok... I see why xD
They should just go to their Youtube Channel and watch the old vids.
Toast is a genius
jokes on all of you, i can get to 200 on a normal basis
lowkey one of the best videos to date tbh
Me with a heart condition: rookie numbers
Song at beginning?
Why has poke descended into a Picture of drug attic
Toast is a man of culture.
Omg lily really loves toast, Toast: im leaving forever Lily:noooooooooooooooo
did fed get a gf yet?
Outro song pls
WHAT IS THE INTRO AND OUTRO MUSIC ITS SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOD
Funny how there's a content warning on this video.
11:16 execute order 69
Poki is the sweetest psychopath 🤣
I was surprised and wondering what you guys must've done to make a video where you got to be 18+ verified... I'm not surprised anymore.
Michael getting really excited when Yvonne pulls out a fuckin tazer lmfao.
*the video got age restricted rip*
What was the music they used in this video
you know the videos good when the title has TASER in it.
Can anyone name the intro
If a 130 is a big deal already imagine when they see Technical completing Ocular Miracle lol
oh god this got age restricted... This is the beginning of the end of otv.
Poki gay Confirm
Mans knew he would be screwed over if he punished Yvonne lmao
They’re not using the taser right, they need to put it inches from the other persons face, occasionally turning it off and lightly brushing it against their neck or jaw. I personally think that putting it close to the jaw joint just below the ear should be honestly terrifying, but also just out of their view can sometimes do the trick. I promise I’ve never tortured anyone.
fed was definitely the person they showed the video of to poki just saying
when toast used his brain againt scarra you know he means business lmao ;D
Poki- “Is this creative or is this torture?” Skarra-  *bead of sweat runs down cheek, heart rate increases”
Give Michael literally any small bunch of items and he can find a way to torture/ annoy someone with it
12:14 priceless reaction
Why did they censor Toast’s ears???
What's the intro song?
all toast had to do is show scarra the stuff
Xqc would clap them all
Scarra: What genre do you think I’d be into? Judging by the fan mail videos, I think we all know
even if its pixelated i can tell it has PH
If I was there, fuck the tazer I would have gone out and got my car battery. It's perfectly safe... well non lethal at least
Dude… poki is a fucking supervillain, did you see her torture Yvonne
Use other object n fck with each other 🤣
When are y'all going to add Yvonne into the description
Anyone know the song that played in the intro?
Can anyone tell me whats the outro song?
guess whos gettiiing deemoooonitiiiized 👀
I need a gif of Yvonne coming up with 2 guns going "tWo!" asap
I am never pissing off poki damn she is scary with a taser
1:38 aww look at da vinky trynna climb up
Micheal brings an "invention" and heart rates go past infinity
Comment
4:25 scarra stole Yvonne's scream
What’s the song ate the beginning
Honestly I'm surprised we didn't see Michael walking out with a roll of duct tape, a rag, and a bucket of water at some point.  For the 10% of viewers who are old enough to understand what I'm referenceing you know he would do it.  And for the 3 other people who have experienced it we know it would raise your heart rate.
If your trying to spike your heart rate be a full metal in rust console and see a Zerg at a locked crate
If this doesn’t get age restricted I’ll be very surprised
Should have bougth potasium chloride. When heavily impacted it sounds exactly as a gunshot. Blind folding migth improve much the spike since fear to unknown is a real thing
Brodin, love ur work man.
Toast showing Scarra adult youtube had me rolling 😂
homie why does yvonne need a taser in her purse
Today on OTV: Toast makes the rest of OTV watch someone shove their leg up someone’s asshole
I think I know who poki doesn’t like😭 Lea……fff
Legging?!
what’s the song at the intro?
Whats dee outro Song? ?  Thanks 😊
tf is amigops?
What is that intro song????? I NEED TO KNOW
my heart rate is 186 and i dont think its good while im only 14
It’s been only 00:01 and I am already feeling single
where's my video michael?
Nice
Title: OfflineTV heart rate challenge  Alternate Title: offlineTV heart rate challenge (Gone sexual)😂💀
Toast starts pn hub  Me: I want to go there
Thank goodness Michael is obsessed with tasers instead of being pyromaniac.
name of the song in the intro?
HAH I WIN HIGHEST HEART RATE MY NATURAL IS 100-120 AND JOGGING TO RUNNING IS AROUND 200
another video of Michell being a newborn
Damm the ph on screen was unexpected
I'mma tell you this for this video if not friendly this time but it isn't
7:51 my guess it's either Leafy or Fed
who is the someone that poki doesn't like
poki was brutal in this
Just keeps getting better
this video got demonetised right? If so, I respect brodin for choosing content over cash
5:23 :0000
is the video Yvonne's deeply ashamed of the badger one?
What the fuck is yvonne saying at 6:20?
Ha jokes on you I have an abnormal heart rate
michael looking at his old videos is like him talking about a robot he made who utterly failed
Poki kinda like Harley Quinn in this video
0:01 NOO BRODIN's HEAD IS IN THE WAY
I would love to see another Toast escape room
Poki trying to seduce lily made me feel the opposite of what I thought id feel when imagining that happening. Ive never cringed or felt so awkward in my life bro lol
outro name？
pokemon emerald casino music
Toast has like no shame at all when it came to going straight to that site
The person that Poki didn’t like very much looked liked Sykkuno trough the blurred image
Ninja Melk
I didn't know they were thus close as friends
Not the hub
I need to know what that blanket thing that Lily has, cause I want it.
Lmao i think the seduction tactic would ve been more efective if it was Lily to Poki
2:23 that’s the “I’m a serial killer and trying to hide it with a smile” look
a
Umm my average is 120 bpm soo...
whats the intro song?
Idiots, fastest and always saves way to put someone's heart rate up is with fear and the easiest way and always working way is with Co2 intake
7:53 , guesses on who this person is??
Umm, why did they react so strangely to those porn categories? Those weren't even extreme...
"is that a fist" "is she using a leg in that one" "why does it look like a fucking octopus" "I don't think things are supposed to open like that" boys what the hell did they see
1:30 My jaw Dropped
Brodin got that uchiha clan drip
I would of just brought out a syringe with a needle
What's the name of the intro and outro song?
Play wolvesville play it please its basically mafia but better and it's on your phone
9:59 poki looks like a psychopath lmao 😂😂
osu players: laughs in pathetic   *dies from cardiac arrest*
Things got pretty sus
The common green aetiologically compete because vinyl systemically shave absent a rustic donald. alluring, highfalutin hammer
5:15 "Nah I'm with my BOOOOOIS"
i looked for a bit but couldn't find the outro song, anybody know the name?
Even though the inappropriate stuff is blurred. I think they should still age restrict it.
How do i get a taser
toast be looking fine af😩😩😩
Who does pokimane not like
Bro mine is 120……..  I need help
What was the outro music?
1:29
They have mykul ptsd
I  Average 104 heart rate all the time because I suck at doing anything good for myself lol
Y do i fell like Yvonne would be good at toucher?
When he said what category he said he would be into I thought he would do something like league of legends rp
Anyone gonna talk about the soundtrack being from the $hittie.$t sonic game ever made?
Damn bro the fat guy has to change something about he’s resting heart rate, he looks like he can get a heart attack, not saying this to offend him, saying this to save him
7:53 good to see mizkif made it
Ok at 1:30 does anyone know the song that's playing?
"is that a FIST???????"
Funny how toast’s hair got longer and Michael’s got shorter
I need that intro song wth is the title?
Toast is a robot what do you expect from a robot?
*_"you can use the objects here. to fuck with each other...."_* - Brodin
Yo, my resting heart rate is 90 am I going to die? 🤣
This is just a thought but would making michael angry by showing him all of the comments asking him to build robots work
I didn't get an ad before this video. Weird...
I saw tazers and went “well micheals gonna be here”
Unsurprising this was demonized
Where is fed??
Am i the only one who wants to be in this friend group
I just wanna know what video Yvonne is deeply ashamed of tbh
biggest brain idea what if they do a video that they do dodge ball with the human attacking drones that Michael made
(Coughs) where’s fed
9:17
whats the intro song?
Now I wanna know all the censored videos lol
Am I the only who keeps rewinding the part where Toast says he likes being part of The Amigops and Lily's heart rises?!?
Yvonne def visited phub that night after the shoot out of curiosity
michael was kissing in the background for the first 3 seconds that was the first thing i saw
Michael, can you make your own vod/second channel so that I don't have to sort through other people stealing your content to see highlights?
6:58 who fired my marshal?
I love how absolutely psychotic Poki is in this one
Me an intellectual: * *pulls up liveleak* *
A very wholesome video
if Lilypichu broke up with Michael then he would turn into a super villan attacking people with his drones
Anyone remember when technicals heart rate went to 200bpm for beating Tartarus, GD reference
Anyone know what app they used, i wanna play this with my friends
Toast what the fuck
Lily getting peeved about Toast leaving is just adorable, like a brother teasing his little sister
Toast: “how do you get a man’s blood flowing”  Me: *oh fuck no!*
5:15 I have been to that site enough to recognize that ui
Ayo?!?!?!
9:17
Lol
I hope that's not Scarra's actual resting bpm, because that's fucking horrible.
Hey
why does yvonne have no links in the description?
Toast is a straight savage 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The catch is if u kill the dude from the too increased heart rate, u have to pay
Why can Toast rock the ear rings so good though 😂
Toast is a genius hahaha
I watch only those otv video which features Micheal in thumbnail i.e all of them
The fact toast stayed under 100 the entire time
They hate Brodin, but deep down, they love him.
Just check their search history and watch their heart rate double.
poki is the kind of movie villain to scare you by firing gunshots right next to your head
My average is 48 :/
What the song in this video? Edit:/end of video
You know I’ve been suspecting this over a year know but I’m finally saying it there’s no way Poki is straight lmao
The entire video: "Just watch porn 4head"
That bg music is s tier
Imagine watching porn with your coworkers.
Michael x lily
9:10 damn, shit is gross
I wonder when's the next PO box unboxing /g
Sometimes I think that Michael Reeves like the bad version of the have time because he knows bloodbending and lightningbending
Whose account was it?
Micheal uses his stand piss dog platinum to hold his heart in place.
Pizza.
Wait who was that person that Poki didn’t like lol
yo what version of lonely rolling star is that
Toast is a mad man
I keep forgetting Yvonne is not part of the roster
I saw tasers in the title and I clicked fast
My resting heart rate is like 104 and idk why
The one time I see Toast type with the first letter in capital is when he searched "Fisting"
4:50 - 6:20 Michael just being amazed by an adult site.
4:46 his blood flow wasn’t the only thing going up 😉
Intro music PLEASE
Yvonne looks like an old woman from the side
Play mafia
Toast is too good at this 😂
me who watched this video 3 days ago can relate 😢
2:22 idk if Michael is cringing or nah HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Man toast is a savage in this video
I wanna see a story time on everyone’s first fan mail
I really wish that Michael did some more physiological terror
Can you guys please do the do or drink game.
So no more independent Michele Reaves videos on his channel?
Through the tasers and the flames
Y’all should have read Michael’s comment section to get to him
nice alola music on the background
the way the reacting to the fisting video sdhgfjkdf
Michael's face at the beginning is just pain
comment
:>
In ur dreams s
What's the song playing during the intro/outro?
Meanwhile btmc with his 195bpm
make them play pico park with the heart monitor and lets see
i could only think of katamari damacy the whole time
wtf? toasts short hair and shaved side hair, and those earrings, he got the drip
Lily just looks like shes enjoying the the thing with mykull Really makes you think huh
i could just stand up and win yay POTS
im scared at yvonne now ggs
Who was that person that poki doesn't like very much? For scientific purposes ofc
"iS tHaT a FiSt?!?"
Michael can you make more video cuz you have not made one in a long time
Michael is looking more and more like harry potter.
Toast is absolutely mega brained LMAO
To make Lily’s heart rate go up Michael should of proposed
What music are they using during the intro it sounds so good
5:37 we all know what you did Poki, hiding your face only proves it
what is the song in the outro
Yvonne, you are now my faborite
What's the anime song
now i know what genre poki is into
10:28  look at that EKG montior going yikes
Michael is starting to look like harry Potter
They straight up tortured Yvonne.
Poki seems like such a Dom wtf. This is probably the horniest shoot OTV ever had.
Anyone else get super uncomfortable with Poki being constantly sexual about everything?
who is someone that poki doesnt like very much
just show michal a bunch of robots thats bout to destroy the world… he’ll get excited
yvonne while sitting and its michael's turn: *flashback war torture noises
We need another fear pong video with the whole crew!
WITH THE BOYSSSSSSS
What was the video they showed yvonnie?
I hate poki she just feels better than everyone
The P*rnH*b meta is strong this patch.
Michael looked so uncomfortable when Poki kissed lily
Intro?
can someone explain the amigops joke toast made I need some context
Polo: *kisses Lily* Lily’s heart rate: *goes down*
WAHOHOOO
So literally not a soul realised the damn Puyo Puyo Tetris music in the background okay
NOOOO THE GUARDIAN THEME THE PTSD IS BACK
Can anyone tell me what the intro song was?     Never mind found it
IMAGINE  THEY HAD A FITNESS COMPETITION VIDEO
I have so many questions  What was poki gonna do  Who does poki not like what is Yvonne ashamed of
Poki: Is that a fist?!?!?!?!? Toast you're sick.
Did I miss something? Who is  Davinky?
1:34 wut song is that
Surprised they didn't go straight to r34
whats the song playing in the back?
haven't seen these in a while toast looks way better
For michael lily should have said we need to talk
My resting heart rate is 72 but i can lower it manually to 48-50 bpm..
It pains me to see Michael, NoT KnOw hand rubber guns. And scare them w that
Gd players:first time?
Lily's so cute wtf
Otv comments but take a shot everytime you see the word michael reeves
Poki has been pretty SUS lately. Not that it's a bad thing. In fact, the videos get even funnier
If this video didn't get demonitised, I don't know what to say 🤣
Omg toast lmao
" The couch can verbally assault you"  Couch: I don't even have memory foam on and I still can't forget that Dumpster Truck of yours  *Heat rate has increased by 100*
9:17 you're welcome
1:10 well that's a bad choice of words
I think Michaels insanity is rubbing off on poki
1:10 "All the things you can use to feck with each other"... So it is OTV Adult Entertainment after all.
It's time to talk about the bees and the birds
Lowkey expected Toast to punch in gay at 5:35 considering its scarra and the gay jokes exist.
I'm surprised OTV is still a thing
What was the vid that Yvonne was ashamed of!
Can someone give context on the amigops joke?
Pokimane downright bad🤣☠️
what did michael spray on the lighter 10:15
6:57 i love how he takes it looking so concerned lmaooo
Scarra: Hasn’t changed a bit   Fed: Changed mentally   Lily: Changed…… her hair a lot   Toast: Hasn’t changed   Micheal: ummmm still an average YouTube crackhead   Yvonne: uhhhhh yeah I got nothing honestly 😂😂😂😂😂
michael can control his heart rate  can we just call him a god of everything
Michael got to express his inner madman
Poki is going nuts this one
why does poki look like she ate an edible before filming this
toast had a glow up, nice job mate!
What was the song that was playing
Can someone explain the amigops thing
Music? At 1:30
I like that they didn’t use the taser on Michael because they knew it would hardly do anything because he already does it on himself so much
"IS THAT A FIST?"
shoulda put uncencored version on twitter Lol'
Michael looks like hes being held hostage while also holding every else hostage
Toast soo inteligent
only people that know where the outro came from are true og
I thought to myself, this is just going to be another great offlinetv video. what a fool i was
This video should be called offline TV watches p*** together
I love how quickly this video got demonitized
Otv knows if they put tasers in the title and michael in the thumbnail theyll get more veiws
Michael is s human rights violation.
Toast should’ve search poki on special YouTube to get everyone heart up
What is that song at the end called?
the way they used a video of fed to get pokes heart rate up got me dying
Make Yvonne an offlinetv member what are y’all waiting for
This video is literally just po******
Alternative Title: "Offline TV Exploring Their Sexualities"
why toast
4:46 - Gregory Toast, M. D. during a differential diagnosis
So is Fed's nickname Blizzard or Activision?
The succesor of Click
I can lower my heart rate                    But no one cares
"Same as michael!" *At that moment my heartrate just went through the roof*
Davinky 😍
Toast just casually pulls up the phub LOL
Who does Poki not like very much?
Michael very interested
guys, maybe, just maybe, can i ask/wish for that for the next video, just maybe, the crew wear/cosplay in the comfy cartel suite?
Fat people usually have higher heart rates, because the heart has to work harder.
I have learned that mykull is great at torture
Gotta love that Spagonia Day ost in the background.
What ending song did they use?
i only found out this channel 4 days ago and i have to say, i love all of your vids and i think all of them are just down right entertaining
what's the outro song? Shazam doesn't work for me
The amount of adult content, and poki trying to "excite" lily 😂 this whole episode was sus but still hilarious.
"here i've got a bunch of objects that you can use to fuck with each other" - not the best sentence you've put toghether so far xD
we need fed back
LMAO HE SERIOUSLY OPENED PH KSODKAOSDKPASDKASODPASD
i want to get tazed now
Throw water at Brodin he needs to be baptized hes the devil itself xD
Poki is so horni in this one what the heck
5:50 michael did like LEEEGGING
What's the song called? Does anyone know?
The thing is, Lily is so used to Michael using tasers that it doesn't really affect her anymore.
why did toast go to phub😭😭😭
Their internet provider will be uncomfy as fuck seeing all the shit they've been looking at in the span of 30minutes
I KNOW WHY MICHAEL IS 72 BECAUSE HIS DEAD ON THE INSIDE
me seeing lily and michael kissing on first 4 sec of the video
Am i yhe only one who likes the screaming and thinks its funny
It turned out to be OfflineTV ADULT ENTERTAINMENT  wait that's what she said : 0:09
Are you seriously watching $@&# by yourself
Pls I need to know the song in the intro is
OTV should do another laugh challenge video!!!
arm wrestling!
does anyone know the intro song name pls I need an answer.
Damb my resting be around 46.
Is the video that poki didnt like is leafy?
OfflineTV: Heart-rate challenge  Also OfflineTV: 4:55
Toast is literally a genius for putting Adult Films on xD
Broden has a Samsung because he can connect it to a tv
What’s the music at the intro? It sounds nice
love the Katamari Damacy song in the background
My average heart rate is 103 I would fucking die
What is the music at the beginning?
Who was in the video that was blurred because Poki doesn’t like them?
Guitarherostyles: XD
12:47 you can tell she’s been practicing that in the mirror
8:27 - 8:43when America’s go to cuba with there suspected muslim friends
Intro song at 1:33?
"I love being a part of the four amigops" lmao only one line and Lily's heartrate spiked by 10 😂
What is the songs name in the end of the video?
BEAAAAAAANS
if anyone wants to know, song at the beginning is katamari damacy - lonely rolling star
4:22 What is Poki doing?
Good content for your kids/teenagers audience, nice.
i hate this generation
oh my...
otv content are so original
has scarra seen a cardiologist? that EKG looks a little concerning
okay why is my crazy detective shipper ass watching poki look at yvonne and think *did poki just check her out*
You should of threatened the peoples browser history getting exposed too the internet😈
I like that mentioning the Amigops triggered Lily more than the threat of electricity....
Toast i have no words for him
i feel like pokimane is the evil one always in offline tv like man whats going in her mind!
Guardian Zelda botw music go brrrrrrr
I still wanna know what the song name is.
Wat is the intro song?
Scientists found that a couple's breathing patterns and heart rates would match up after sitting close to each other. They didn't even have to be holding hands or talking for this to happen. 😍
If you were wondering what's the outro name is called Katamari Damacy OST - Lonely Rolling Star Hope you saw this comment if you wanna find it :L
“LEGGING”!?!
oh toast
Im not surprised the video got demonetize
Fun Fact: when near your significant other your breathing and heart rate sync up that's why lily and Michel both had a heartrate of 72
I thought they're just scaring each other... Turns out it becomes torturing and stuff. 💀
I like how all the women are all grossed out and the guys are just fascinated
u should have used sailor moon pXrn for yvonne LuL
2:12 Fun fact, Michael and lily's heart rates being the same is not a coincidence. It's a subconscious thing to synchronize breathing and heart rate when close to your partner  and its so wholesome
All Micheal had to do for lily was say “we need to talk” and it would’ve gotten so bad
✨~OTv Heart Attack challenge~✨
These vids make me so happy. 😁
Tbh if I were Poki my heart rate would strike too when it’s Yvonne “fake tasing” next thing you know she accidentally tases you because she scares herself with it
Hey off on TV when are you guys going to play Red flag with disgust toast and Yvonne and Michael Reeves and broden that would be good video watch
"Man I love being a part of the four Amigops." *Smiles, laughter, and Lily's heart rate ascends* "I'm gonna leave OfflineTV and join them." *Lily abuse on Toast*
Michael was going crazy with that fisting legging stuff
Scar I know how it feels to be tell be because I'm chubby but hey the only reason why girls like chubby guys because we're warm in the winter and we're like teddy bears.
Toast mvp POpcoRN
Being on your phone is kind of cheating imo. It's a lot easier to stay calm if you can focus on something.
Lol p*****b
Who does Poki not like
*stops watching OTV for half a year* *video with the word taser in the title drops* Welp
4:20 we all know what went down boys
A psychopath can control his emotions and even his heart rate. Hmmmmmmmmmmmm Michael
Me: Scrolling through my recommended and only reading the title of the vid Also me: Ohh Michael Reeves!!!
Just give Michael a tazer
bro what, i remember when i had to get my heart rate monitored my resting was like 58
Yo Michael what the hell it's been months you haven't given us a video stop simping and get to work!!
I'm sad they didn't call it "Through the tasers and flames" because that sure sounds cool as hell
I love how scarras heartrate kept decreasing everytime they said something like “imagine everyone here naked” or when poki did whatever with the ding ding
1:15 "fuck with each other"
Michael is the god of destruction
This is my most favorite now
w0w
Wait did fed get kicked out
Welp, We know they all watch those now Also I always love seeing those cute intros with the OfflineTV logo
btmc is built for this
2 fingers not the whole fist this time poki?
ok but at like 6:59 look at michaels face when lily shot it. he look so scared for her
i think i heard botw guardian music lol
HI YVONNIEEEE
4:45
6.00 now I want to do this, watch my friends both nervous and confused at the same time  what are they gonna do Hmmmm
Poki sounds like she really wants something today
Ahhh yes P Hub it always work
Does anybody know the outro song….it’s so good!
This makes me even more worried for osu! players when they're about to fc something lol
my method on how to spike someone's heart rate, you ask? no? well I'm going to tell you anyway, just fucking scream into their face as loud and long as you can. (or put anything threatening, like a taser, close to their eyes. humans get more scared when something scary is close)
Are they trying to draw in simps
Toast is a fucking genius
7:12 *Yvonne is Michael 2.0*  8:32 *I see no difference.*
Idk how but I tend to control my heart rate and lower it when ever there’s a thunderstorm because those terrify me
katamari damacy!!!
Nobody tried rule 34 I'm surprised
Michael yelling "wow" like Pink Guy
OfflineTV OnlyFans when? jkjk
that video was fed for sure
if I were using a heart rate monitor on osu while holding a 1k combo my heart rate will keep increasing
Every video is just brodin torturing offline tv and I love it!
I love Yvonne’s scream 😂
What is the music
Nothing bonds people more than watching pron together and joking about it lol
Am i the only one noticing the puyo music lmao
yvonne you really bought a taser? dont you have tons of those in micheal's room
Yvonne doesn't get paid enough for this shit
does anyone know the song from 1:29 - 1:39
Yvonne is so good at scaring people
IS NO ONE ELSE GONNA ADRESS THE PRON THEY JUST WATCHED
Lmao, Poki is down bad
Increasing your heartrate is easy, decreasing it is not
This is cringe
That scarra heart rate at that age appropriate website is killing me
OTV adult talks? Count me in to manage taxes yay
These videos make me less lonely even when I have no friends.
yooo they have a pet zigzagoon
Toast on his KPOP phase
Broden is just looking for ways to elicit payback otv for all the mental abuse 🤣 eg giving michael access to tazers
A whole knew meaning to “leggings” has been released into the world because of this video.
what's that song they were playing? in the intro and outro
This is the horniest otv shoot ever and I love it
What's the outro song called?
Laughed so fucking hard
Imagine if they did the same test but everyone was a bit drunk 👀
Aww lily does not want toast to leave
I feel the video Yvonne is ashamed of is the badger one
That amigops joke triggered Lily huh
the reason why lily's heart rate didn't spike with a taser...prob thanks to spending way too much time with michael
When poki was sayin if the guys “thingy” matters le not when u watch those videos jiggy jiggies no the song to a guy doesn’t matter only how much the girl enjoys it for me personally cause if u care then that ding dong smol brotha
poki look a little like hermione
No ones mentioning how sweet toast and lilys relationship is😂the dude knew exactly how to spike her heartrate and it was just saying"peace im leaving"
why is there a BTS member on the couch?
“Michael can consciously control his own heart rate.”  Im not even surprised Michael can do this
I love that they used katamari damacy music
DOES ANYONE KNOW THE OUTRO SONG? (Couldn’t Shazam it T.T)
Brodin a true psycho
Half of every thing poki says is sexual and she wore no makeup I really don't think I could survive those clips
Æ
You know what I would've done, I would have asked Michael where his gadgets were
The lady's mad cringe not gon lie
1:14 AYOOOO?
This just shows that Lilly, is just acting like she is scared all the time. She is really not feeling anything, typical Korean... for the content
Quote of the year “is that a fist?”
why is no one talking about the katamari soundtrack
poki is slowly becoming more terrifying.
6:26 pure confusion
Hey cool Video but i got one Thing to say, why is it that everytime Yvonne is in a Video, she is the only one not getting linked in the Description?
I'm curious which is the one that Poki doesn't like.
This went from 0 to 100 in a bit of this video and it hit 100 FAST
Poki's mind 😂
1:32 M U S I C   N A M E
Osu players when they are 10 seconds away from their new top play will be the highest heart rate
We love you toast!<3
you guys should play nepolian it is a card game and i think that it will be fun to watch you guys play that game
Still doesn't come close to Btmc Raise my Sword fc.
I remember with reeves didn’t sell out
"Honey, we are meant to be."  -Lily, caught in 4k
so we not gonna talk about how cute Lily and Michael was in the very beginning ??
Outro song anyone?
Should’ve scratched sum chalk
13:32 I need these types of friends
Why does Michael look like an Asian Daniel Radcliff
5:09 toast a man of culture
Michael had this one chance as the de facto best time ever to propose to Lily... and he missed his chance. She'd've been at like 160.
Yvonne is the best at scaring herself 🤣
1:35 what song is this?
Poki couldn’t win this coz they couldn’t rig this ……this just reinforces my thinking that there usual challenges are rigged for poki to win most of the times
WHERE DO I GET THAT BLANKET
L E G G I N G
7:54 thats definitely fed right, a very close member of otv and only a year later they're all cringing at him. Definitely sad to watch
song????
This challenge is made for yvonne
anybody else curious about the "video" played at 7:53?
these are the kind of videos that make you look to your friends....different  jk jk i missed ya guys, ya made my night n_n
I wonder if the video got demonetized?
Toast looks good with that earring
comment for algorithm!
Toast's strategy with a certain internet site seems to have been very effective Truly a genius in biology and psychology (Side note: I'm pretty sure he used the p*** idea so the others would use it on him)
what is this intro shits a bop
I'm surprised Michael didn't get or build a taser
comment
Yo is the P.O. Box still open I feel like sending Michael something during Christmas
9:39 lily sure is an Asian mom now
Bruh when Scarra said, “what genre do you think I would be into Toast?”   The amount of power Toast had in his hands
Scarras got 99 problems but a heart rate ain't one
leg

I swear someone in OTV played Katamari and got hooked on the music 😂
what is the music, super good!
Whats the song they used for the intro and outro
what is the song at the beginning?
Lily being the ruthless business woman we all know she is would scare anyone.
Katamari
toast out here with the 2 mil IQ
What is the song playing in the background during the intro
whats the outro song called?
Why is poki focused on sex all the time ??? 🤔
Can someone link to the song?
Poki is fucking terrifying
1:16 anyone know what music that is in the background ?
The song pleaseeee
Video of someone poki doesn’t like very much 😂
Michael and Lily smooching at the beginning my heart :')
I love how Michel goes from “oh I’m so sorry!!!” to “SLIDES INTO FRAME WITH TASER”
Micheal couldn’t raise Lily to the triple digits cuz she trust Micheal with her dear life.
whats the song during the introish?
Imagine if toast tried to touch Lily’s sweat it would’ve spiked
C I wanna kno if he’s talking bout phub or  xnxx
Feel bad for scarra he had a rubber band gun pointing at both heads
John 11:25-26  25.Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: 26.And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.

Watching these videos is convincing me Poki is a serial killer
Poki is very freaky lol watch every other offlinetv video if you don’t believe me
I would just need my best friend to come right up to my face and stare me in the eye, then I would loose in seconds
LMAOOOOO TOAST 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How did I KNOW poki was gonna try and flirt with lily
2 girls one cup could stop your heart
This was a gold mine of a video. I want to see the unedited version
Where do i get this heart monitor thing??
Yo fr fr Scara might wana go to a doctor. A Resting Heart Rate of almost 100 is on the verge of tachycardia
Can I have the teemo figure
100% this video didn't get monetized HAHAHA
Lilly's heart rate doesn't goes up, means she is repeatedly sees Micheal with taser countless of times.
Heartbeat average rate of Lily is SAME as Michael, their hearts are in sync... IMMA DIE OF CUTTNESS OMG.  On the other hand... WHY IS NONE OF YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? WHERE ARE MY SIMP/SHIPNONTRASHERS COMARADES?
1:30 does anyone know the name of the song in the intro?
Wait when it was censored and said the video of someone poki doesn’t like very much, who was it?
man i love offlinetv
"looks up akali rule 34"  90% of  the heart rates: Up UP UP we go
Give the little offline TV brain damage
I wonder if the video of someone poki doesn’t like very much is Leafys leaked
whoever edits these has a great music taste btw
Trevor simulator - OTV edition
Did poki really try subduction on lily😂
Katamari music as the intro is the best thing ever
5:46 a teenage boy's first time seeing this stuf.
You should totally make a game where everyone has heart rate monitors but only ones is working and you basicly have to try to say stories and see who's the Imposter based on the stories or lies you tell about them
😂
What's that song in the background in the beginning when the title comes up. It sounds so familiar
when my medical condition makes my resting heart rate the same as their's when they think they are going to get tazed XD
New title: Brodin forces and encourages torture of the OTV members.
maybe yvone's favourite category is starbucks :>
4:56 atta boy Toast
lonely rolling star based
Why is my heart rate rising?
What's the outro song called?!?!? I need answers help! (Shazam couldn't help this time)
I though toast was literally going to google search "How do you get a man's blood flowing" and do some research.    I should've known toast is dirty.
What's the outro and intro song?
Toast just wanna watch the hub
What the name of the intro song?
Just play league of legends ez...
It's on trending now
After this I am never going to know what toast searched up
That background music went hard  What's the name?
Anyone else think Lily is turning Michael into Harry Potter?
I have a feeling a lot of people's favorite number gonna be 86.
and most of their fan base include kids
at 9:17 you can see the fear on Michael's face
What was that outro song?
Alternative title: every OTV member tried to be Michael for a video
Should have asked Toast what he thinks about the Amigops just being Corpse, Rae and Skykunno and that Fallon didn't want to play with him. Sometimes you gotta be cruel to get that heart rate going xD
"Is she using her leg?"  LOL WTF IS THIS?? Yvonne went to college for this!
Michael after the video: *deletes his whole yt channel*
What’s the intro song?
What's the name of the intro song? I NEED TO KNOW ; - ;
I must know the background song
I would of lost if I participated, the fact of being surrounded by my favourite c h a n n e l
Wait.. where is yvonne on the roster?
Hold up if lily's heart rate didn't go up when poki tried to kiss her that means she's used to it 😂
Whats the outro song?
Yup I tried and tried but I can’t deny it anymore poki is my dream girl 😂
The guardian has spotted you.
Editing on point...sheesh
Can somebody *PLEASE* tell me the name of the song in the beginning of the video.
13:32 Scarra's line of them doing something together is so memorable, it's ...! Also, enjoy how he asked Yvonne what her favorite category is
Toast said: "Bet"
Why is that guy at the back looks like harry potter XD
intro song name pls
4:15 Scawwa jump scare
Like Michael I can raise my heart rate at will. When I was in a hospital, for a severe wisdom tooth infection, I had the same lab tech draw blood every time. This lab tech HATED me as a patient. This lab tech would actually miss on purpose. She didn't like me because the first time I had blood drawn she missed 4 veins, and ended up drawing it myself on the second try while seeing doubles. One time she had just missed the 9th time in a row. At this point, I had enough of it. I raised my heart rate from resting at 79 to 205 in about 10 seconds, and of course the monitor I was hooked up too thought I was going into cardiac arrest. She FREAKED out. She thought she had hit an artery or something. A few years later I found out she was fired for a similar issue with another patient.
This is just like creative torture
They should have started grinding on the toast
What’s the song at the beginning and end
- We watched so much porn today... together... - What's your favorite category? 😂😂 IM LOSING MY SHT GUYS
You should bring back Fed to Offline and watch Feds lattest video.
puyo puyo bgm pog
Just try to set good score in osu! in front of all - guaranteed win
I wanna know what that intro bgm was
Yow toast is a fucking genius with the graphic content my dude almost gave scarra a heart attack
Michael talking about his past self like a failed version
michael is rubbing off on them and i like it
what the fuck did poki do to that youtube budy
what's the title of the song they used in the intro and the outro???
I thought Poki was kinda be a lil freaky at the beginning then Toast just does the ultimate 1 up and literally shows the Hub on the big screen lmao
i love how in the beginning while brodin explains , lonely rolling star is playing and the sheer _contrast_ between the mood is hilarious
Poki: 5:55 EEEEW  Me: Peter's here?
can anyone tell me that intro song LOOOL?
Not the melodica video 🤣
The scariest thing, most heart rate-raising thing in that room should’ve been Michael with that rubber band gun lol
Toast solutions are the best HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Does anyone see my other comment because it disappeared on me
No one Literally no one 0:01 Michael and Lily kissing.. they are so kiyutttt
Anyone know the outro song?  Nvm i found it it's Katamari Damacy - Lonely Rolling Star
WHOLE VIDEO IS AAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA
The song ??
dwadadw
Well. Fisting is better than scat
1:15 lol just past the one minute mark  Edit: actually what a timestamp
Michael looks like harry potter ngl
13:34
Toast really went onto ph to get scarras heart rate up lmaooooo
i keep being unsubscribed from OTV, and my memory just keeps forgetting this channel exists and i love coming back to many videos to binge - but DAMN when did lily get those glasses? toast has such a cool different vibe
i like the video because Yvonne asked to
toast is immune to porn, he must have seen alot
lily: we're gonna see who can reach the highest heart rate!  poki: and die??!!?
Scarra: we are NOT going to show that!  Brodin: points the camera to the TV
Thumbnail: 208 HEART RATE What really happened: 150..
9:45 The Simpdom has never seen this side of Pokimane before
NEED MORE SYKUNNO
10:30?🧐🧐

Yvonne is so good at scaring people
Katamari song slaps.
We are so close to getting  offlinetv onlyfans started 🤣
7:53 thats fed isnt him
I HEARD THE BOTW sOUND WHEN GUARDIANS SPOT U LMAO I
e
18 on trending.. o.o
is Lily wearing 100T shorts!? or am I imagining it.....
Legging became a category
.
5:22  ✌️
Scarra a chad
Poki just being naughty
Michael's literally Tokita Ohma wtf -accelerates heartrate -gigachad -has trusty partner -crackhead
Whats the song in the intro?
Micheal should have his saxophone do you know how load they are
Gonna guess Yvonnie is gonna lose this so hard
We need a part 2!!!
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
OTV learning young kids what PH is since 2021
Hay OTV. I've been watching the channel for a while. I like everyone a bunch. Also If you see this comment Have a blessed day.
Someone’s heart rate keeps declining till they flat line
3:14 i appreciate how they used the soundtrack from botw that plays when a you encounter a guardian
does anyone know the intro/outro song?
Have Lily get a quadra and the have toast steal the penta and boom Lily wins with highest heart rate
I would love to see Reeves's tycoon game saves, and yes he probably had a few because he loves causing pain and those games were famous for being pirated to the point the publishers gave up enforcing it...
what song is that?
just make them set a new top play in osu!
its pronounced guitarherostyles
What have we learned from this: Scarra does not have a heart
Taser and Flames Sounds like a normal Friday to me
Song title?
Today OTV watches porn together. Tomorrow, OTV makes porn together. Natural progression.
What's the intro song?
9:25
That Katamari Soundtrack is so good.
What's the intro song?
Uncensored version when?
Hahaha so fuckin funny I love it XD great vid guys!
Nobody  Literally nobody  Toast: "pops up the hub to increase heartrate"
I think we need to rename the title  Offline TV reacting to Po****b thumbnails
poki was down bad this video
Everyone else: jokes, scares, videos  Michael: *does a ritual to summon Satan*
PLEAE WHATS THE SONG :))))))) HELP ME PLS <3
This is was great
9:00
what song was used in the intro
Hey
Y puros corridos tumbados
Yvonne really tried really hard but it all backfired on her 😭
toast's look with the earring is iconic
Scarra the winnner!!!!! Yeah babyyyyy!!!!
Lmao 🤣
I’m 106 BPM at age 15 is that bad?
from this video i can conclude Poki is weird. VERY weird. also Toast. and brodin. did i say brodin yet?
Yo name of the outro song ?
Yo name of the outro song ?
LEGGING???
I love how the poki start talking about something big and related, three boys' faces turn so awkward LoL
I have developed an eight pack from watching this video
5:10  Aight guys, I’ll be right back, lemme just pause this video.
How tf does Lily and Michael have the lowest heart rate?!
May I know what's the song used for the intro?
where the fuck is brodin special
I mean, are you really even friends if you haven't watched a fisting vid or two together.
Controversial opinion. But offlinetv content just hasn’t been the same since Fedmyster.  Don’t really care about the videos as a whole. But I do enjoy the members individual content on their own YouTube channels.
Yes this is what we need on channels forcing people to watch pornography😂😅
michael and lily's resting average being the same is so cute. so in sync lol
*WHERE ARE LILYS EYEBROWS*
what’s the song in the end pls
Just get them all to play beat saber
They played one of feds videos lol
0:25 up and down  rule 34 artist:BEST VOICE ACTING
Fucking genius toast, fucking genius
Brodin : *chuckle* "I'm in danger"
9:23 Toast, you evil son of a bitch, I love it
Kata,ari music
Are we not gonna talk about how Poki can't do anything scary or mean to Lily but can turn terrifying when its other people (specifically Yvonne)
Does anyone know the outro song?
It’s fitting Michael is on the front of this one
WAIT toast has no tattoos na ni troll
this is by far one of the best OTV video, more episodes please
So no one gonna talk about Lily and Michael's resting heart rate just syncing <3
Is being able to control your heartrate not normal???
A year from now vids: "who can survive the most legging before their heart rate increase by ×2"
the 3 girls act like theyŕe SOO innocent with not watching porn and shit lmfao...IDK how much more faker one can get.  PS: we all know who that vid was lol, and to not like him is fine, acting innocent about stuff is not lol..
anyone can tell me what's the outro song?
They should let Michael handle the taser.  It's a lot scarier knowing that he might actually tase you.
anyone know the song title at 1:35 ?
I measured my resting heartrate in 15 second interval and multiplied by 4 to get average of 72/minute I am a 20 year old active male.
Honestly it figures that Toast would be the one to bring up the hub, but I'm surprised they all had such adverse reactions to it, especially Michael. I feel like he's seen some SHIT before, so having the hub throw him off that much is almost shocking to me.
heart attack speedrun any%
Everyone barely hitting 95 for scarra... Toast pulls up Pornhub insta 105.
6:48  Yvonne : I'm just telling is that normal?
What’s the Japanese music in the intro and outro, it’s so good
Cheat code: Pop some adderall and smoke some meth
POTs has entered the chat
huh is poki like this or is she down bad?
Michael is the embodiment of chaotic neutral.
Anyone noticed how Michael is highkey nerfed in OTV videos? Like he's only at like 25% crackhead energy in OTV videos.
Ooh! This is like that game on Weekly idol!!
4:55 nah that’s cheating man that’s cheating but I love how everyone knew exactly what he was going to do
2:23 I mean that’s what you signed up for when you start dating her
Toast is hot
Watching p*** with the crew nice!!!!!
Omg yvonne bless her heart ❤️
These girls need to Grow up.  You aren't five.  You don't need to be wrapped in a blanket everywhere to display your innocence.
water bomb game XD
5:10 hEy BaBy WhAtS uP aRe YoU sErIoUsLy WhAtChInG cOrN bY yOuReSeLf
Where was Michael screaming "Nightmare, Nightmare, Nightmare, Nightmare"?
i can consciously change my heart beat too :0
If any one of them had a heart rate of 200bpm any point, they'd be dead by now.
I love how he just unblurrs the search bar, just so we see that xD
Does anyone know the song that plays at the end of the video? I tried looking for it but couldn't find anything
This is my favorite channel bybfar
Anyone know the song they used?
bro toast hitting puberty makes me question thinks
Toast knows what's up 4:54
now do sykkuno and bring up shark girl
was does yvonne's head looks like stewie griffen
9:15 ....
4:17 what was she gonna do?
I’m relaxed skyrockets to 120
Yo guys remember when a 2nd grader was watching your videos
Even though it’s blurred we all still know what it is
Brodin, in light of todays Pico Park stream experience, I would like to see Amazing Race OTV  version once everyone is vaccinated :D
All u need to see is the orange box and white text to know
scarra resting heart rate.. 80
I bet that person was fed
Anyone know the outro song?
each video is less and less fun, why? is the pandemic?
It make my heart warm and smile seeing scarra so happy at 13:25
They might as well just put Yvonne in the main roster
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
what is the back ground music?
100bpm resting heart rate is awful lol.
The one way, like the ONLY wat, for me to get my heart racing is to PvP IRL or in Minecraft
Never thought I would see the day otv watching *adult* content together
So much little content should had made it longer wasn't very fun to watch
Song name at 1:35?
say it with me,           Thank you Brodin
Poki: is that a fist?
Come on YouTube put people that actually deserve it on trending
Thats a great question Scarra
In the first 3 seconds Lilly and Michael kiss....but it's hidden behind Brodin's head! :D
What's the intro slide song?
Toast is a genius for bringing up p**n
I just ask myself why they did not just make micheal threaten everyone with a taser, it would probably work
I like how it literally skips toast and says he didn't react but the he a boy got 2nd place😂
My friend suggested this yt channel...  Now I regret it
The whole raincoat visually punish because guide biophysically dam throughout a skillful english. royal, jaded company
While Poki was Seducing Lily her heart rate went down
gotta appreciate the use of botw guardian theme
What was the music for their intro? It's a banger!
If I’m in the same room with the Michael Reeves... I’m not gonna last long, XD
Toast wins
Next episode: offline TV sexual harassment seminar 😭😂😂
7:53 >_>
Hi
sign me
Does anyone know what the outro song is called
Omfg poki tho 😂😂😂 "Is that a fist!?"
Poki still looking like a sussy baka
One day in that house, and your eardrums are in fucking orbit wtf
"Is she using her leg?"  LOL WTF IS THIS?? Yvonne went to college for this!
Unsub
For a video without a sponsor they sure are trying to get demonetized
9:17 Micheal is not happy LOL
Yvonne you went to school for this
what was the name of the outro song ?
Lilly has put of with his shit so long he barely effected her xD
My heart rate will not register....I'm dead inside
Also now we all know poki is on the vyvanse train.
Who was waiting for fed to walk in the door...them heart rates would of been 200.
The only way to make someone heart raise. Is by showing them real gore it still gets me. But the the effect is you're going to be scar and traumatized
Full disclosure when I was with my ex my heart rate would get up to around 130-180 when we were making out so I feel like I would do really well in this challenge
"are we still talking about fisting?" 6:32
Yvonne is precious. must protecc 👌🏻
It makes a lot of sense that toast has a lot of control over his heart rate
snipers have to practice lowering their heart rate. just think about every badump, take deep breaths, clear your mind, and imagine putting more time between each badump
outro/intro song?
I never though Yvonne would like the ok bye category
I love at the end  Scarra: "so whats your favorite category?" Yvonne: "OK BYE"
what was the japenese song at the start?
Subscribe to the NDL or you really are a schmuck
what is the song they used in the beginning and end ??
I Love the intro music on this one
"Is she using her leg?"  LOL WTF IS THIS?? Yvonne went to college for this!
This video made me read my own heart rate, and it was 120. Yikes.
I thought Michael was going to fake propose at first when he was on his knees with the slingshot (for Lily's part)
Toast is so aware of how his friends work. Cool to see.
2:56 poki starting it strong T^T
Fuck, I can’t remember that song in the intro/outro and it’s really pissing me off
Lmao we all know that the video of someone poki doesn't like very much was a video of Fed you guys don't have to be secretive about it we all know he's the main person poki don't like
9 روز تا عید غدیر خم
9 days until Eid Ghadir
A good way to lower your heart rate is by blowing on your thumb
6:58 not the marshal edit lmao
Who was the person poki didn't like very much
Through the taser and the flames?
lonely rolling star? who is the person who picked this?
I think we need an OTV after-dark series...
Whats the outro song
y'all need to hit the gym, those heart rates are not good 😂😭
best video from OTV
You ruined your experiment by drinking a "fuck ton of coffee."  Dummies! lololol
otv fucking dies part one
Toast: “Man I love being part of the four amigops” to Lily when she literally got them all together 😭😭😭
I love how they always use the Sonic: Unleashed music tracks
Toast is just a fucking genius💀
What wqs the video that Yvonne was so ashamed of?
So getting a highscore in this game basically means you have to have a heart attack
Uh Oh. I can consciously manipulate my heart rate as well. It's very easy to spike it up. However it takes a little more effort to bring it down. But here's the thing: IT"S VERY DANGEROUS DON"T MANUALLY INCREASE YOUR HEART RATE.  One of the adverse effects of spiking your heartrate is the release of adrenaline. When this happens, if you do it often enough, it will enlarge your heart. I was talking to a cardiologist and showed him how I can manipulate my heart rate by demonstrating it while he had my heart on the ultrasoud, and how in that particular instance I released adrenaline and my body temperature increased, I started sweating, I was jittery etc.. He was very impressed that I could do this. However at the end of it he concluded that doing so can enlarge my heart and eventually give me heart problems over the course of probably years or months. Ever since then I've stopped. Michael can fuck up his heart if he does it at all and frequently. YIKES
Scarra being happy because he got first place widepeepoHappy
there has to be a way to figure out what that video is at 7:55
Toast with the big brain play made Scarra lose haha
this video should have had a heart rate monitor for everyone and one person to try and increase everyone elses.
Imagine for Lily, Micheal tried to propose/breakup with her😂😂
Michael tries sensory overload on his own girlfriend that he lives with....hmmm yeah probably should have gone really quiet and stared at her as it would have worked better
Yep that’s it, Poki is a psychopath confirmed
God I love Micheal    But God does poki make it hard to watch otv videos
While osu player's hit 160 on a daily basis
boop
Michel is the worst person you could have invited to this
Toast is the real man
2:22 lmaoo sorry that was so funny-
Ah Yes My Favorite Title "Through The Taser And The Flames"
Idk if im right but ive heard that you have a lower reasting heart rate if you are athletic and of course how much your emotions can chage your heart rate
"Video of someone Poki doesn't like very much"  You can say Fed.
Someone should've put the back of the taser on them and turned it on.
Dude i once litearly got my heart rate to 210
The video should be called Torturing People like Michael
Anyone knows where the outro music is from?
Michael looks so proud when Yvonne pulls out the taser-
Yvonne looking like 2B
LMAO Poki getting back at yvonne with the taser cracks me up, and when Michael did that circus solei fire trick hahaha
what's the intro song ?
Name of the song in end?
I cant look at anyone here the same...
We need another of these videos lol
Scarra has having the time if his life
GuitarHeroStyles: XD
Top 10 Trending
Bruh, my resting heart rate is 132
Of course micheal would try sensory overload
poki would make a great electro shock torturer
God damn what she do off camera lol
Hi
Poki looks so scared and innocent when she said "I don't things are supposed to open like that"
Who was the person poki didn’t like?
When I'm resting I can get my heart rate down to 50s
Toast is the toughest of them all
The amazing Brodin and his fantastic concepts for videos 🥺🥺
Toast going on pornhub is a f*cking genius
Congrats on 5th trending
Michael and Lily in the start..❤️
at some point, I would love to watch OTV go ghost hunting. I think that would be hilarious

i"d just lose with my resting 140 heart rate
For anyone reading this going through tough times, obstacles, negative thoughts, I feel this needs to be said. Spirits are Real. Keep Living, keep supporting the Spirits of Life, Spirit of Life (God Almighty) gives rise to a Selfless Spirit. A Selfless Spirit gives rise to Salvation. that is being concerned with the well being of other people Mentally, Physically, and Spiritually. To not hand each other over into developing a rebellious spirit against GOD. To know that we as the Living Man are responsible for each other during this journey of Life, always encouraging and compassionate, reflecting what Love looks like, protecting each other from the true enemy. Committed to the welfare of other people which God Almighty selflessly continues to give to the Living Man, which I feel is another opportunity to get it right. Allowing the Spirits of Life to develop within Mankind will change us for the better. Staying fully committed to protecting each other which I believe brings Salvation and Redemption, which can and will lead people out of unnecessary debt, building Life up solidly. There is no perversion or confusion about those attributes. The spirits of darkness can not hurt you, although following their self destructive ways is way I believe, they are able to hijack the Living Man. Their perverted appearance reflects their perverted spirit which they are aware of to use to frighten or intimidate those who are growing close to GOD Almighty. (spirits of darkness trying to strip The Living Man of what GOD created The Living Man to be,  to stop the Living Man from building a relationship with GOD Almighty, and to use The Living Man for it's own evil, selfish, and destructive intentions) When growing out of the indoctrinated ways the enemy crafted and trying to spread the message to others, the serpent will use distractions. Loud noises being the operative choice, fear, bombarding thoughts, causing doubt and intimidation are other ways the spirits of darkness use to keep your attention off of what it's afraid of. The spirits of darkness have no true power which is why they leach off of Life. Remember You are Alive and the source of your power is pure. spirits of darkness is a spirit of death (which is also it's source of power. Remember the perversion it uses is wicked. That spirit of death becomes a selfish spirit that will take advantage of others for it's own selfish gain, which lead people into bondage and Spiritual Rebellion. DO NOT LET THAT SERPENT STRIP YOU OF YOUR BIRTH RIGHT. I know and stand firm in my beliefs that the spirits of darkness will never prosper over the Spirits of Life because their plans can't be accomplished without leaching off of Life. Give that serpent zero room to breathe and give Spiritual Authority over God Almighty and the Spirits of Life because those attributes are too pure,  precious, priceless, protective and powerful to used by spirits of darkness. They flee from it. dark spirits manipulate truth, taking advantage of what you lack in knowledge, cause unnecessary nonsense, chaos, hurt and pain in people's lives, so we as Living Man must develop a relationship with GOD Almighty and not allow those dark spirits to ensnare us into their evil, selfish, and Spirit stripping plans. Take a second to reflect on that statement. Before you're aware of their existence, they'll  try to keep you distracted by following the ways of the world which wisdom in the Bible instructs people no to do (Romans 12: 2)  They will want your focus on things pleasurable to flesh, self destructive to your Life and detrimental to your soul. They do this keep people distracted from their existence and distracted from the Goodness that is in the World. Betting on the fact their invisibility to Humans will lead people to believe they don't exist. These spirits are very real, to make matters worse they use that knowledge to their advantage. Their intention is spiritual bondage of the Living Man (Adam + Eve) (look up the definition of the Hebrew names) which is evil and selfish. Their intentions are to cause the Living Man to rebel against and be separated from GOD and the Spirits of Life, attempting to destroy Living Man's Life by indoctrinating self destructive behaviors from childhood. (Teaching Good As Bad, and, Bad as Good and People following those principles) The frustration is understandable but remember they do this in retaliation against GOD Almighty (Creator of the Universe, Selfless Spirit, and Salvation) During the process of Developing A Selfless Spirit, the spirits of darkness may try to harm you (Do not listen to any self harm tactics they say, don't not hurt anyone in retaliation  i.e. damaging property or violence towards people or animals Ephesians 6:12) Read the Story of Moses and the Israelites. Pharaoh's attempt to go after the Israelites after They crossed the Red Sea is an example of why they operate the way they do. Everything the spirits of darkness say is an attempt to confuse, disrespect, disrupt, cause doubt and to slow down the process of what serpent is afraid of (Growing out of Spiritual bondage, but most importantly building a relationship with GOD Almighty and the Spirits of Life. The anger the serpent displays is the frustration and fear of The Living Man growing out of it's indoctrinated ways of the world and giving the spirits of darkness less and less room to move in your Life. The Spirits of Life (Inspiration from Above and Beyond this polluted planet) will always overcome the ways of the world. The Spirits of Life do not author confusion. spirits of darkness hijack the Living Man Mentally, Physically, but most importantly Spiritually to prevent themselves from going extinct which they know will happens when I happens. I believe the spirits of darkness were casted away in the first place to prevent those dark spirits from destroying what GOD Almighty created as a beautiful blessing. Those dark spirits have no respect for life, no foundation to support Life, willing to lie about their intentions to use the Living Man as a tool to rebel against the Creator and the Spirits of Life, which is written about in Genesis. The Living Man is ALREADY a reflection of GOD and the Spirits of Life, do not let the spirits of darkness try to strip away what GOD equipped the Living Man with aspects of The Creator's Spirit: Power, Love, and a Sound Mind (Reasoning Mind ) Luke 10:19, not feeding into the enemies of plans, schemes or plots to destroy your Life or my Life nor Rebel against God Almighty) (2 Timothy 1:7 )Those spirits are the enemies of Life, but They are already defeating themselves in the process which they also know to be true because they leach off of Life so Please do not give Spiritual Authority over to them, cast them behind you and Keep Living and keep making progress. No need to fight with those spirits although frustration is understandable and they deserve no favors. Keep Living to grow out of the frustration into Gratefulness, being saved from developing rebellious spirit, which is of the Serpent. The serpent and scorpions tactics are always the same. By following the ways of the world, which wisdom in the Bible instructs people not to do, that is a way the serpent uses people, if the serpent sees it can't use you, you become a threat to the serpent (Which is a Good Thing) That fear the serpent tries to instill in people if you become a threat or turn away from following the serpent, is it's reaction to what it knows it shouldn't do or have done, (Fear of Retaliation) be advised. We are already above developing those types of spirits. Please do not degrade yourself over a being that does not care about your life nor your soul.    Edit: For any one feeling as if you are going through an evil spiritual attack....meditate on things concerning Spirits of Life (i.e. Inspiration from Above and Beyond this planet, Selfless Spirit, Salvation, Hope, Encouragement, Unconditional Love) Those demons will flee. That 🐍 would NEVER post a comment like this for the people of the world to see freely in support of those who desire to see the Spirits of Life to develop within Living Mankind across the world and for Life to build up solid, Remember the Spirits of darkness want to destroy everything The Creator of Life made. They are unable to do this without leaching off of Life, You have the Power over that serpent. I have learned and want to share the message that Life is about not giving up on the Important Focuses of Life, Living through the hardships (sacrifice), Learning valuable information from those experiences to help someone less fornuate out, and making progress not only for Ourselves but for other people Living in this World which wisdom in The Bible teaches is the first and greatest commandment. (Matthew 22: 36-39)
You guys might have unintentionally diagnosed Yvonne’s heart palpitations lmao

Just saying it's probably not too hard for Poki or Yvonne to find porn stars that look like them to connect to... Scarra probably has a harder time....
someone shoulda grabbed scarras inner thigh
it would be easy until michael comes up
Are you watching prn by yourself? Nah I'm with offline tv!
10:24 lol what's the video?
This is basically an extended version of the scene with Stanley and Michael in the Office
It's all fun and games till Yvonne pulls out the taser triggering everyone's PTSD. 💚
Anyone knows the intro/outro song?
Amazing video.
Toast pulling up the hub be like
7:55 who is it?
I’m surprised that they were scared at the tazer because they live with Michael     Michael: flame thrower time
mfw some geometry dash players get up into the 200s near the end of a level
trend started
Can't believe im watching..... Nvm
damn that amigops drop tho lmao
“Hi I’m Michael” 💀💀💀
who does poki not like?
whats that intro/outro song tho, like i need to know
this video is not monetized
When the person was thinking of the title they thought of Michael only Satan knows that he was born for flames and tasers
There’s so many good moments that no one’s talking about
Please when Yvonne was scaring herself with the taser-
Yvonne’s face the entire time she was in the chair: XD
The song you probably are searching for is "Lonely roling star" enjoy.
rain
what is the name of the ending song?
Legging
anyone tell me what song it is on the introoo?? 1:30
How to get everyone’s heart rate over 150 have Michael stand up and pick up the taser
Scarra being near 100 resting is a bit disturbing ngl.
ABC’s of SALVATION  ADMIT: You’re a sinner, condemned to DEATH (physical & spiritual) .  Romans 3:10, 23 There is none righteous, no, not one … For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  Romans 6:23 & James 1:15 the wages of sin is death … sin, when it is finished bringeth forth death. (Spiritual death is eternity in HELL !)  BELIEVE: that JESUS died, rose again, and that HE ALONE can save you from sin, death, and hell.  Romans 10:9-10 if you: believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness.  CONFESS: JESUS CHRIST, and nothing else, as your own Saviour. Romans 10:9, 10 & 13 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus … confession is made unto salvation … whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  Before it’s too late, forever, DO IT NOW! God’s gift is FREE and as easy as A-B-C !
Very funny video
Seems like someone needs a real God freeeeiiind to help put with some pending issues... -.____.`
I mean seriously Scarra's heart may be in a bad condition
Poki probably could’ve just bent over in front of them and their heart rate would’ve hit the moon and back.
Toast actually the smartest one there
Whats the outro music?
Lilly is immune to tazers because she is living with Michael
And xQc gets 180+ playing GTA RP lmao
What… the… fuck… did i just watch?
Damn simps would pay 1k+ Just to be near Pokimaine and Scarra gets to call her daddy for free,dman . . .
Damn Poki's mind really turned dirty in this one...
Me at summer school trying not to laugh or I get introble for not doing a test that I have not started. :P
Now they have truly bonded
8
I’m going to win if I’m in the OTV
O bet they showed poki fed, I bet 20 bucks it they blurred it out
Lol how do you get a man’s blood pumping
Another failed attempt of Poki seducing Lily
Not even half way through we already have a family session if ya know wat im sayin
tryna find a comment about who Poki doesnt like, cant find one... please help
Offline TV: poki & toast instantly take it sexual edition
Offlinetv is just 🔥
9:06 is that a bulge fellow viewer OwO
Toast blood racing god
im surprised toast didnt gave michael a lap dance
I was expecting someone in the room next to them to break a ceramic plate on the floor and yell angrily. That would have spiked the heart rate for sha
5 on trending
What's the ending song, I need to know
Who else just randomly peruses subscribers channels while watching a YouTube video?
Do another unboxing but make it really long
5:32 Toast always makes me do a belly laugh whenever toast says the word "Alright!" then proceed to do something to make content.
Scarra you are not stressed you are just FAT! Like me our heart rate are very different to others
that brodin fellas gone soft, we gotta take em out back
That's crazy, I average about 60bpm.
Brodin's ideas have turned from torture to more amusing torture
the katamari damacy music is so good
Can you do a try not to laugh
Real talk though, it's awesome how Micheal couldn't get Lily's heart rate to go up at all, because she knew he would never actually do anything to her.
“How do we get a man’s blood flowing”  OH NO
THEY GOT PHUB LMAO
Poki would win by sitting on anyones lap lol
Taser goblin is back
Yvonne hella cute in that hair
11:21 He didn't react cause he's already seen um all😂
u really see everyone's true colours coming out when it comes to torturing your friends
"YIKES"
i wish i could have atleast one friend but alas destiny has a diffrent plan for me
Actual gold
pokimane and Michael would be the best duo for torture
best otv vid yet, brodin's really outdone himself
Shit just went up to a whole new level when they allowed Michael to stand and torture people.
0:01 lily and michael smoochin'
Why didn't you guys do Brodin?
What Increases the Mans Blood flow?  Lol that had me
posted prior to my drive... motive for stalking... the heart rate game...
Should have measured Scarra's lowest while he was sitting in the chair, because at some points it was down in the 80s which is way lower than his "starting" 98.  That would have left him around Michael/Lily range which makes sense  Toast on the other hand is a confirmed content robot lol
Reads title: "Ah, a classic"
OMFG Yvonne's so cute! <3
When toast when on the hub, I lost it
“Are we still talking about fisting?” Michael reeves -2021
Toast: I know how to get one’s blood pumping.  Me: I know too. But I think the cameras have to be off to make it hap— NEVERMIND YOU ARE ALREADY GOING THERE!!!
They got hiring signs up but don’t want to hire we need MONEY.!! 😳😳 in my 👁TRUMP IS THE BEST HE IS A BEAST.!!! I VOTED TRUMP 💯
B O N K 🐶 GO TO HONRY JAIL
things have really been going on down in the content department
Brodie casually just shows it XD ( if u know what i mean)
I love this activeness dang ❤️
They should search the(art of zoo)
Wait they have a dog called DaVinky
Poki violated micheals YouTube buddy
Is temmie dead?
I get second hand embarrassment watching Michael's old videos 🙈
I think the easiest way for Lily and Michael to get their heart rates up would have been to kiss or flirt with each other I'm surprised they didn't do that 😂
the japanese music was awesome ^^
7:54 Bettin’ 100 fuckin’ bucks that that’s the Leafboy.
Why did Lily's heart rate spike when Toast said he would leave OTV for the amigops?
Yvonne using a taser in front of Michael is sacrilege.
Scarra: Toast these is very inappropriate. Also Scara : what category you thing im into? Me : lmfao
The shenanigans in these videos are too funny
What’s up with poki this episode she wild
Poki with a taser is somebody’s fetish 🙄
Poki going sicko mode in this one
fun fact that you shouldve learned in gym class for 5th grade  your resting heart rate varies depending on how much blood you pump with your heart at a time. So if you pump hella blood, the rate will be lower. Same thing vice virsa. This correlates on how fit you are and healthy your sexy bod is.   Now i pulled this shit from memory so sorry if this is completley wrong
The tasers didn't do shit to Lily. Being with Michael has just made her immune to fear.
Idk why but I just visited my cousins yesterday. Lily kinda looks like one of my aunts. 🤣
Lol poki can even get Lily trun on.  9:18  what a fucking loser.
What's the name of the song that was playing in the background at the start????
Poor dog
"TASERS AND FLAMES!! - OFFLINETV HEART RATE CHALLENGE"  "Who's the best torturer."
Holy shit, I saw the gripper in Poki's hand about to go to Scarra's ear. If it happened, it would have been painful as f. I was afraid for a moment.
The way Michael said "Legging?!" had me dying 😂
Sometimes when they say they're going to fire brodin at first i thought it was a joke but now im kinda scared they might do it
You guys need to show miyoung face to toast. It will work hahaha
Hold up, I recognize that music. Man, I remember Katamari
Health Condition as well...
this has to be against the Geneva Conventions right?
This episode got spicy, fast.
0:36 lol XD
Michael should've searched for "Creeps Mcpasta - The Cough" Lily as one of My Little Ponies. XD
What is the intro song??
Best video in a while
1:30 what is that song?
Well Michaels sensory overload worked on me. Not that it raised my heart rate but good Lord do I have a headache.
5:50 Girls: * Cover their faces * Michael, a little kid: WOOOOOOOOW
Toast pulling up the hub on scarra was genius
dude screw tasers and flames  WATCHPARTIES - P***HUB
Does anyone know where they got the blankets from in this episode? Upvote for answer!
what an ending
"TASERS AND FLAMES" me: *clicks*
Fr tho who doesn't poki like
So what I get from this is that Yvone won't live too long, with those massive heart rate spikes. 0:10 Also I wouldn't mind that. (?)
Poki tries to seduce everyone
L E G     L E G
"Video of someone poki doesn't like very much :)"  I think we can take a guess at who that is.
What’s the outro song called?
alternative title: Heart attack challenge
Yvonne screaming gives me a headache. She could be hilarious but she just screams
what's the song called?
Best Channel. Keep going with the good vids! <3
Anyone else see michal bout to jump up when they waxed lily
Bro wat did poki do with the ding ding  she's kinda sus
poki when the twitter giveway will be announced
I predicted that Mykull with subconsciously shoot the gun at the end causing Yvonne to scream 😂
We need cooking show again
So Abe is just TRYING to explode? He’s gonna just keep going until he finally pops??
Toast read my mind
Before even watching the video I just predict Michael's crackhead energy will produce the highest BPM without anyone needing to do a thing.
Z
What is poki smokin, i want some
4:22 she probably put on a Spiderman costume
They should have made Toast play a game of League with Lily and Yvonne
Lily should of said, “Mykull, we need to talk.”
"So what's your favorite category?" -QOTD
whats the intro music?
This is literally the most crazy otv video I've ever seen.
WOOO Free Cardio !!! LEZZZ GOOO
Why is poki the most perverted one there lol
Michael: "After lily stopped talking actually"  Me: Likes video
And they watched porn for another hour TOGETHER. Friends who watch porn together STAY together !!
i love on how theyre just exposing each other in this video HAHAHAHA
Im a minor
just watching this made my hart rate spike
12:21 he is turning to Harry Potter...
POKIS NOSE LMAO
Those blue blankets look fluffy as heck 😃
AYOO???? IS THAT PUYO MUSIC IN THIS VIDEO???????
Can anyone Tell me the name of in song in the intro and outro
Oof
holy shit we need part 2 so fckin bad this was easily top tier content wtf
I hate getting my heartrate taken at the doctor. On my watch it's tellin me it's like 60 but then the moment someone tests it I get nervous and boom 100 ):
Cleanbois vs Saladgang vs OTV vs 100 thieves
Lonely rolling star in the background very fire go og katamari damacy
Bro wth happened to Poki???
I have a ton of cursed images.
My resting heart rate is 40...
Toast didnt react for 3 minutes. Hahah Classic Toast bwahahah I kinda hoped they tried hard raising his blood lol
More mafia games please
when your resting heart rate is half their average
Lily said year 2020 , she developed a separation anxiety with Toast.  I love OTV Family. I hope you all are healthy and happy.
Lily being a clingy sister to Toast is cute AF ngl
Unique, as usual
What a sexually charged episode Quarentine really do be hittin different.
you have to shout them in the ear
Can someone tell me the song that they used in the intro and outro of the video. I've definitely heard it before and it's driving me crazy not knowing what the song is
You guys are cool
Yoooouur Lonelyyyyy Rolling Starrrrr!
Noice outro
what blankets are they using :{
What’s that song in the intro/outro? Shit’s fire
what did i spend 13mins and 51 seconds watching....
Brodin deserves a punishment for not having a punishment for this video.
oK
Always a good video when Poki flirts with Lily. Hahahaha
What’d we learn? Pokis fucking freaky🤣
Tbh I find Yvonne and Toast cute together
hello YouTube
Lily looks kinda old with the new look
7:54 is that Fed?
Let's do an Otv video of them just reacting to weird porn
Content is just dull..
Whats the name of the song in the background at 1:38
The title should be "otv torture"
Michael looks so good w that cut!!!
I hate how I had a dream about this exact video...
alternative  title everyone watches po*n
Lowkey concerned for scarra.
poki screaming "ewww" at 5:55 reminds me of the "eww peter" sub alert from peter's streams
what's the song used for the outro?
I’d probably die die to the amount or sheer pressure lmao
People are afraid of what they don’t understand
I think heart rate of Toast always rise when he angry so it must rise went he was gaming LoL and WoW with friends
Yvonne should be content creator coz she's amazing
Toast has unlocked a whole new kind of chaos 😂
Fun faaact… the higher the resting heart rate the more unfit you are
more... MOREE I SAYY
okay to sum up this video.. they all are sexually frustrated lmao 😂
Of course it starts with poki talking about filming OTV porn…
I didn't know a fist could do that
Poki has a thing for brodin confirmed
I'm surprised Michael is not the one tazing in this vid.
Intro and outro music?
Anyone knows the name of the intro and ending song?
Of course Micheal and lily are sitting together
WTF IS THAT!! - OFFLINETV TRY NOT TO GET DEMONETIZE CHALLENGE
Smh, Michael should have just proposed to Lily to get her heart pumping.
They could use that as Lie detector :D
Yvonne not getting a place to sit bugs me..
Poki sneak peaking to PH: is that a fist!?!?  Then remember she’s supposed to be pure
LOL HAHAHAHAHA
This video just shows which person n otv is good at lying
LMAOOO
r rated
yeeess
"michael can control his heart rate"   JESUS CHRIST, MICHAEL IS JOTARO
they're lucky Michael didn't use his "where's waldo training chair"
They should've included another girl so that she can flirt with Michael and get that Lily heart rate maxed with rage
Somehow i got the feeling that so many children will never get a chance to be born today?
OTV girl members being traumatized for 13 minutes 52 seconds straight
next video otv watch adult entertainment as a group.
Brodin! You said a bad word!
Yvonne is so good at scaring people she even scared herself 😩👌
6:41 we must protec Yvonne at all cost.
I m a simple man I see tasers and I click on it
I would never expect to see lily scrolling through pornhub, especially while everyone is looking at her while she is doing it aswell
6:46 she says "wait I'm just saying"
Today we are learning Torture
Can anyone tell me the song they used for intro and ending Please?
i was today years old when i learned that pokimane is a hard switch
while michael can raise his heart rate on command (which i think is friggin cool) i can lower mine >:D is that good?
DEMONIZED
si poki kay manyakon lagi no. myghed
I just realized my heart rate is 60bpm but I am not active ever. I think that's bad lol
It's interesting to see that Lily doesn't like her most viewed video
I recognised Marshal's shots. I should stop playing valorant
Da fuk? My heartrate when i do nothing is like 38-40
very fun video 👍
TOAST WHAT THE FUCK!?🤣🤣
Brodie is just saving up punishment so the next one is 2x as worse.
The three other amigops watching be like: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
7:53  Someone, decipher this.
Yo
Why does Poki always bring up dirty topic and act so lesbian? 🤔
Meanwhile osu players casually on 150
The biggest question of the century… what is your favorite category?
Toast was wild for pulling up the hub
so we know the people with the big heart now
otv are definitely masochists
Shoulda pulled out the Where's Waldo training Chair
Everyone :comes up with mental and physical torture Toast: HORNII 🤣🤣
I feel like Yvonne gonna have a heart attack living in OTV
toast went big brain and instantly went to search up the hub damm just damm toast XD
Still can't believe how Michael can control his heart rate lmaoo
I love the katamari damacy music in the background
yvonne it's a fantasy, therefore we pick the big dude
Song name?
Remember now, po*n is good with the gang B)
It should have been called the "Doki Doki Challenge"
brodin slowly is becoming the best offlinetv member.  his ideas are everything
What's the outro music?
7:52 Wait, what was that?
Damn it's over already
Why poki so s3xual this vid???
i bet Michael just loved it when brodin said he has items to spike the heart rates- like the moment he said it he just poofed up XD
xqc would go crazy
Otv torture challenge
Even though half the video was just pixilated, their reactions were fuckin amazing
is the song used in the intro & outro from locoroco it sounds like locoroco for the psp but im not 100% sure
Whats with the theme of this video..
Poki should have used her death stare like she did in the ninja tournament  POki's ninja adventures  had to give a  jojo refer u know     ;)
bruh, ya’ll gotta upgrade that tv, that stuff pixelated asf
Me to toast the whole video: WOOF WOOF RUIFFF WOOOOOF. 😩✋🏽
im sorry but i cant stand pokimane and ill stand by that till the day i die shes like that annoying uninivited girl bestfriend that annoys you when youre dating her friend
dudes what’s the song in the background it’s really nice
topic should be :Offline tv tries to tourture each others
"is she using her leg!!??"  uhm.. ex-FUCKING-CUSSSMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!?????
Scarra: Whats ur favourite category?  Yvonne: Ok, byeeeee         We all know she meant Sailor Moon
did toast really just do THAT to scarra?
I like that  The Yvonne and poki is saying “EWWWWWW” but still keep looking and still questions  While Micheal, scarra and toast is like “WOOOOWWWWWWWW” “LEGGGINGGGG”
Brodin really one ups himself everytime, one day though he will succeed on his hidden goal to kill them all
nice video
Is it just me or does Yvonne looks like Rosé on the thumbnail?
🌺
Lonely Rolling Star is such a banger, nice fit.
por- ok bye
Poki to Lily: "What would spike your heart rate 🥰 involving me 🥰" Poki to Yvonne: "YOU THINK I WOULD FORGET SO EASILY? 😈" 😂😂😂 I love OTV girls so much
They should’ve just brought up Michael’s comment section you would get pissed buy it right away
video about someone that poki doesnt like so much? absolutely that F gaytan
Could've easily spiked Michael's heart rate by showing them pics of him being wholesome
8:14 M-Micheal... that's evil ....
*And in the bigger ranges*
Yvonne needs to be in every video!
I regret searching fisting
9:49 looks so much like Nicki Minaj's Monster part lmao
Michael should have tried to fake propose
If mr crabs was a person he whould look like scarra
They didnt use the line that scares absolutely everyone "Hey do you wanna help me with my invention"
Sooooo what's the intro and outro song?
Toast is so good at making their heart rate go up 😂 he knows exactly what to say.
Bevarsiyaan thu
Making this video definitely brought them closer together
10:58 Toast: I want to be horni. *After three minutes 11:32 Toast: Im just sad.
So what’s the punishment? Michael: *BTS SHAKE*
i was about to watch this on the tv coz my mum likes to watch OTV too but now idk if thats a good idea 😂
what was the video of the guy she doesnt like bruh?
Yvonne with the tazer was iconic, probs The most iconic part lmao
dghhgf
I'm so curious as to who Poki doesn't like very much that got recommended in their youtube lmao
"How do you get a man's blood flowing?" First thing I thought of was stab them...
Toast knows what triggers people lmao
Should have shown toast dancing to Kpop lol
i'm down for some OTV adult entertainment
Bruh 💀😂
Bruh poki just mad annoying, pls get her out
HAHAHAHHA offline tv's finally getting sponsored by pornhub HAHAHAHA
Those heart rhythms are really odd
Father, I crave more torture!
The intro was great, and it's good that Yvonne is in the videos too instead of behind the camera
since your throat hurts so much from yelling, then stfu
Toast : *HORNI IS ALWAYS THE ANSWER!*
Anyone know the name of the song at 1:30?
i give u thumbs up but im to stooned to just look how u raise your heart bpm for 13 mins. i know it fun tho
Everyone when their plan fails. *So ehmmm Hiiiii Toast*
Im assuming they played a vid of fed for poki
I was waiting for michael and lily to try flirting with each other lmao
Demonetization speedrun world record 100% glitchless
exposing porn to the youth, & making look ok, you guys sicks minded you will pay for it.
Give my bro toast a blanket cmon
Why scarra looks like harry roque😭
The CIA is taking notes from this video on new ways to increase its “enhanced Interrogation”.
Whats the song in the intro and outro???
Michel looks like a crack head look the the “funny” stuff at the start
No ads in this video. What is this? A charity video?
We pretty much just watched how we could torture OTV w/ minimal effort lol
Poki is so chaotic and funny, i love her 😂
This video is just a demonetization speedrun.
i think its safe to say pronherb won this round
Dont remove brodin, his the best
looks at Pokimane: "Fed." There I win.
The level of trust they have tho
I thought this was an official Offline TV video, turned out this is some CIA interrogation torture method compilation.
fully expected michael to try r/makemesuffer on Lilly
Awwww Lily being upset of Toast leaving OTV :(
fun fact: other geometry dash players experienced 190-200+ bpm
sure fire ways to make yvonne’s heart rate 📈: 1. toast asking yvonne to come to dragon 2. brodin telling yvonne he has pink sand for her
LOOONELY ROLLING STAR
wait..... you're telling me roomies don't watch the orange youtube together?!?!?!
YO THATS JUST BLURRED OUT RICEGUM LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO
this is an easy game for me, since I have CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA my heart rate could be spiking up and down easily by that I mean up above 200 or below 50 in an instance, KEKW 🤣🤣🤣
Scarra: so what’s your favorite category? Yvonne: ok byyyeeee
Everybody's heart rates goes up with coffee but Poki's weirdness level goes up by coffee
I just saw tase in th title and i was like, "Oh sweet, Michaels there"
sidemen patience test xD
Brodin said the F word! WTF!!!
im disappointed that micheal didn't go full KGB interrogation
Alternative title : Making OTV members horny or arousing OTV members
Bruh my resting heart rate is 50-55 sometimes even 47
Mew hello Mew
Lily new glasses look pog on her :D
Song
A whole knew meaning to “leggings” has been released into the world because of this video.
A simple way for getting someone to  get to atleast 100bpm is... 228922
What's the song used in the beginning and the end? I don't think it's in the description
Is it only me that still can guess what that thing is (5:10) by just the colours.
1:15 really brody .-.
Here is a challenge: Brodin does every single challenge that he requested to OTV, if he doesn't do better than the average result, he gets punish once
does anyone know what song they used in the outro
I like the melocida video though D:
the way to go is to jumpscare taze them once then just hold it off against their skin and occassionally take it of and go in with it on and turn it off just before it hits them
who is the someone poki doesnt like at 7:54
Poki down bad
What's the music on this video??
Tell Michael to upload on this YouTube channel and YEET:)
At 4:27 it looked like scarra screamed Yvonne
5:15  shit went from 0 -100 real fucking quick
Surprised this isn’t demonetized lmao
W00t! more OTV videos!
Scarra is a national treasure, you can't change my mind.
This is quality content
Toast is too savage XD
You already know this vid was Michaels idea
I wish I have friends I can watch porn with. Just for shits and giggles.
These are all rookie numbers, when etika saw smash release Snape he went to 178
7:13 yvonne has entered michael's teritory
You guys should’ve gone on Reddit 50-50 lol
Instant appreciation of the Katamari soundtrack intro 🙂
Just saying otv vids never fails to make me laugh. thank you!
Can someone tell me what's the song used in this video??
how about you what is your favorite category ?
The otv intro is so cute
Do they have PREMIUM THAT IS THE QUESTION?!?!?!?!?
I'm kinda concerned, but I would be immune to this challenge. My resting heart rate is 110-120...
What the dog doin
I'm so confused what video that was that Yvonne is supposedly so ashamed of??? Judging by the reaction of the others they all know what it is. What could elicit such a response from her as to double her heart rate?
Yvonne brings out one, not enough instead she brings out two
im scared think they are some intelligence service agent and torturing for information imagine getting captured by them man scary
I was waiting for an OTV videoooo yesssssssssssss
6:50 anyone else notice Iki towns them playing in the background
GOD I LOVE TOAST
Was the blurred guy fed?
I wonder who was in the censored video for poki
Toast get a spray tan?
ah whats that intro song
2nd title "Watching Adult Entertainment With OTV"
LMAO Michael’s just the epitome of chaos
I love toast
Anyone know the bgm for their opening?
They definitely brought up some foki compilations for poki
Ya know I’m kinda sad that they didn’t reach 208, guess my heart’s just a freak.   130? Gotta bump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers
This feels like, a video idea made by Michael
this was thoroughly enterntaining.
Anyone got the sauce?
scarra the stoic
Can you guys do a 23 n me dna test video?
brodin pls punish uwu
Damn my bro rly pulled a Phub on him.
outro song?
OTV more like ATV
poki: "i'm relaxed" her heartrate: 📈📈📈
Anyone know the outro song?
YAY!
this video needs a health disclaimer ngl
Again, michael's skin lookin good
Brodin: you can use these objects to f*ck with each other Also brodin: points camera at a massive dingding
Probably the most explicit episode yet.
Is brodin doing some research on human body, some ML/AI thing As only they would experiment these types of things 😂😂
Poor Poki, gets rejected by Lily in every single OTV video.
Poki single af xD
omg lily’s reaction to toast threatening to leave OTV is so funny
as much as i dont want to be that guy, but      I'd be totally calm with this
When Poki went EW i thought peterparks stream was open
4:51 They had such innocent giggles before toast actually did it
I thought when michael was on his knees he will pull out a ring lol😂
Good thing they didn't search "Pokimane" on PH... Let's just say people there like to... pay tribute to her.
I swear “legging” is gonna be on top searches the next time I open “it” up
anyone know what this song is called? 1:30  edit: never mind, it's  "Lonely Rolling Star" - Katamari Damancy
We got 3 videos within 3 weeks :D
LMAO they discovered siswet 😂
Toast lily 😂
What's the song used
this felt so random and i'm ok with that.
Micheal should just say he’s filming a new video
Poki: Mark my words , vengance Will be my
Poki is very energetic in this video lol
What’s the song at the end of the video?
0:09 Pokimane: "What if some day instead of filming OTV videos, you're filming OTV [censored] Brodin's Heart Rate: *Brodin Didn't Like That*
bro whoever edited in sonic unleased music u r a man/woman OF CULTURE!!!!!! :)
LOL good one
Loki can change his heart rate? Oh sorry i mean Michael
Toast 5 head lol
Toast is f*cking hot
content quality is declining ngl
So everything is fun with friends around
tf id lose my heart rate is legit 58
6:06 Yvonnie + Poki out here asking the real questions. Here's my answer: no because i cry hecka a lot
Who poki hate?
what song was in the intro and the end
THE POWER OF THE HUB!
Did anybody notice how poki was suspiciously being more like dirty Ig you could say like wtf?
The background music thoooo
I seen the rubber band gun before
Ayo what was the music they used in this video I like the music so can someone tell me the music they used
Toast BIG BRAIN 4:48
7:54 huuuuummmm…………..
Poki can be very scary sometimes…
what's the bgm song?
I feel like Poki just kinda made everything overly sexual but it was funny as hell
I've gotten my heart rate down to 39 and maxed it out at 210 so I win.
11:14 Lilly look like a hacker at this point
Entertainment at its finest
The way Yvonne laughs floors me every time
Music title please 👉👈
Anyone know what song their outtro is?
lmao you should have let yvonne play minecraft with the mindbois and it would have tripled
With Lily Michael just had to kiss her lmao
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm wtf #    #
Alternative title: domonitozation any %
Michael's girlfriend is beautiful.
perfect video idea taze pokimane
i wanna see valkyrae doing this, it would be nuts!!! or maybe sykkuno too....
i waited 2 weeks for a 13 minute video, this is my life okay
This vidro reminds me of a jigsaw death puzzle... Wait is brodin secretly a jigsaw mastermind
After all this OTV videos, why yvone still not official member? Just get her in already!
Poki’s a menace
im glad they finally brought yvonnie into the video
This was 100% Michael’s idea
If god want to me to live he wouldn't have created a heart attack
Toast is like the Batman of the group he knows all their weaknesses and how to defeat them 😂
Best video so far, Brodin
Are we not gonna talk about the fact Michael and Lily’s heart quite literally beat at the same pace while resting
Yaaaay on mbirthday
Lily reaction to Toast "Leaving" OTV is Wholesome + Gold for me 😂👌
bro they missed the perfect opportunity to use toasts kpop dance videos😭😭😭
Outro song?
This video was pretty much "Offline TV watches porn together ft. Extra Horny Poki"
"What if some day instead of filming OTV videos you're filming OTV *Adult Entertainment"*  Little did Brodin know _that's exactly what he'd be doing that day._
The music running through the episode was kinda loud. Pretty distracting
Is this gonna get demonitized?
This is an excuse for Brodin's torture fantasies
Me: Sees title Also me : "Michael how have you tormented your friends this time???)
i can just imagine michael saying: WELCOME TO A TUTORIAL ON HOW TO MAKE YOUR FRIENDS HAVE A HEART ATTACK
Its so funny HAHAHAHAH but short sadge
Bet michael's heart rate will sky rocket if they read shitty robot ideas in the comments
for me all you have to do is surprise thrown a giant scary looking  spider and my heart rate will for sure double
Bby Yvonnie being so innocent 🥺❤️
Its sad that i cant play this game with my friends   Cause i dont know how...but i can control my pulse at will....
Jesus between poki trying to seduce lily to scaring the shit out of yuvone...
Whats the outro music?
What music is this? :)
4:51 Yooo, Toast has the strats!!
Now we know what Toast's preference when it comes to pron without paying Scarra.
I was eating while Toast pulled up the P-Hub..... So yeah that was bad timing
can anyone tell me what song they used in the end?
Michael tapped into his CIA “enhanced interrogation” methods
I really appreciate when Yvonne is involved.
What is the video yvonne is ashamed of
My heart rate doubled during the entire video 😂
Video of someone Poki doesn't like very much? Fed, it's ok we don't like him either.
I..I can’t….. What even was this video
Damn what brand is that taser lmaoooo
Thar blurred video for Poki has to be Fed's 😂
outro song?
Oh boy, the shenanigans you lot get into is entertaining.
nice
Why poki’s seduction didnt work kekw
Scarra: we are NOT going to show that!  Brodin: *points the camera to the TV*
Lmao, what do I want to write "Yvonne's the fucking best " 🤣🤣
IS NOBODY GONNA TALK ABOUT WHAT TOAST LOOKED UP FOR SCARRA LOL
through the tasers and flames
They should've put contacts on Michael's eyes like Stellachu did
Poki- "Is that a fist?!?!?"   Bruh, isn't that normal for you
This is a comment
im still very happy that lily is Sayu va
My resting is 110, don’t think that’s good
whats the song in the beginning of the vid
I regret searching fisting.
O.T.V What?!?!
If I remember correctly, couple holding hands actually synch their heart rates, so I am not surprised at the baselines of lily and michael
"IS THAT A FIST?"  LMAOOOO
Bruh finaly the P-hub Stream to  TV function has been used 😂 *Trauma intensivies*
7:56 i wonder who?
Why does LilyPichu sounds like Sayu in genshin hmmmmmmmm.... :O
Wow Toast Went All In!!!
Wow Toast really knows what annoys his friends lol that's kinda wholesome (?)
my apologies but u should of search ehite just white u finna see long
No way toast put on That thing right
What was the outro song in the video?
Toast is always the one to be thinking out of the box and get the shit done😂😂
what's the intro/outro music ?
What the hell is going on in poki’s mind
Make a video where brodien is the star of the show
Poki: tries seduction to raise someone’s heart rate…..   Michael: mAkEsHiFt FlAmEtHrOwEr!!
ah michaels favourite challenge with his fellow test subjects
I wonder who the blurred figure was that Poki doesn't like very much............
Which remix of lonely rolling star is this?
Build a robot that can play impossible piano pieces at bad times during the night
I adore Yvonne. She’s such a reactive person. They need to get heart rate monitors and do another haunted house. 😂
what was that reference that Toast told Lily?? what are the four amigops??
Michael is the brodin of this video
TOAST DOING THE MOST SMAET ASS MOVE IVE EVER SEEN IN OTV
At least I'm watching it before it gets demonitized
The song is LONELY ROLLING STAR BY THE 8 BIT BAND
Scarra was sweating bullets lmao 😂
Can anyone tell me the song name @ 1:30
I have a Fitbit, so to an extent I could play along XD
5:17 Are you seriously watching Pxrn by yourself?? OTV: No I'm with my boys!!!!
its funny that there is an amigops stream happening rn
It was more funnier when they literally search the hub.
tell micheal to give me a smooch
Didn’t know torture is funny thanks guys
I think Poki’s gone a little mad
Is it bad that in Toast's turn, I thought they would play old videos of Toast and Janet to spike his heart rate?
Michael & Lily snuggling in the beginning tho 🥺
5:21
5:55 that kinda sounds like Peter's sub alert
intro and outro song?
lol i will probably never stop watching offlinetv
then fed enters the room and pokis heart goes racing
Toast: Peace was never an option
The Sonic Unleashed theme at 1:57 used a part of my brain that hasn’t seen activity in YEARS
Well, things escalate quickly
I honestly thought Micheal would destroy this tbh
Somebody has to tell me what the yvonnie video is about so I get the joke
One of the best otv videos
toast is the best haha
Ending music please?
Those heart rates are nothing compared to geometry dash players heart rates
This video escalated real quick
I’ve never been so proud to be named after that man
"Is that a fist?"   I'm laughing so hard rn.
5:20 me and the boys at the sleepover
is there a compilation of poki being a psychopath somewhere cuz.. das gon be a good video right there
Why does lilly look like someone in the anime with cozy clothing
Bruh i thought michael was gonna do a lap dance for lilly
Wait what video is Yvonne ashamed of?
BRUH!!! you guys are wild for that one XD but that was fun content X)
"Holy shit, poki's having a heart attact" lmaooo
"Is that a fist?" - Poki 2021
uhhhh.... any other medical professionals here wanna talk about scarra's obvious ST elevation????
No yvonnie. It's not normal.
wait i have the same thing as michael where i can do something like force an adrenaline rush that temporarily increases my heartrate
When toast mentioned Amigops I nearly lost it 😂😂
shoulda shown toast some hentai... they clearly don't know him well
Did you know that the bottom of 1 liter Coke bottles were used as alternatives for a fist.
it's me or lily looks more mature with black hair?
If u ever want your heart rate to spike all the way to 170+ bpm as fast as possible. Just Play osu!.
Was really thinking Michael would fake propose to get Lily's heart rate up
What is michael using to spary that fire spicker i wonder
Things we learned in this vid.  -they wildin'n -Poki is one of the boys -legging?? -lily shoudn't hold a gun 😂 -micheal hate his early content 😂 -toast is sad
poki scares me
question. whats the name of the otv logo?
What was the song in the intro?
Commenting at the 420k view mark
is that a fist
They should let Michael handle the taser.  It's a lot scarier knowing that he might actually tase you.
Bro this video got interesting really really fast
Lily kissed Michael
Runningman Game
Guys just playing apex legends alone at late game gave me a heart rate of 187
WHAT THE FUCK TOAST LMAOAOAOAAOOAOAOA
Toast out here chilling while everyone is suffering
6:27 all their faces lmaooooooo.
Has anyone seen guitarhersstyles he get like 200 every time anything remotely scary happens
4:46 while they out here playing checkers, toast is playing chess...
and some how poki is confused about her unban request
Watching Poki terrify Yvonne with the taser has been the highlight of my day 🥰
ayeee its katamari music in the intro
I love how all the girls are hiding when toast put that on and all the guys are deadlocked eyes on to it 😂
Sorry i hope this isnt annoying question but what was that song for the intro its sounds so familiar but i have terrible memory
The dirtiest people in offline tv is definitely toast and scarra😂😂😂😂
Loved this video just hope that the next 2-3 are not average again
This video inadvertently became "OfflineTV watches porn." LOL
Bet that ain't scarras heart rate it's his cholesterol
Hm
Video Yvonne is deeply ashamed of has to be badger
Friends that watch corn together, stay together 😌✨
What video is Yvonne ashamed of....?
Yall getting those mint mobile ads alot to?
I'm convinced that Toast can big brain out of everything
thnKS OTV
All I got from this is that half the couch has gotta get doing cardio.
Are you guys open for adoptions?
Here for 420k views nice
video went from 0 to 100 after toast was in control
What I learned today: Yvonne is being permanently scarred by OTV and may need to see a therapist.
yall whats the song they used called?
Fucboi Lily at 13:34
"IS THAT A FIST"
What's the outro song they are using?
Just make me walk up the stairs. Peaks at 200 I guess.
I love the image of goblin lilly crouched in the corner looking up among us p**n
You guys should do a group stream and try Star wars the old republic it is like world of Warcraft I think you all would really like it you can have four in a group (not including raids)
Poki is just down bad!
Where does Brodin get these ideas? 🙂
As a sadist watching this I felt happier.
my resting rate is 114……
I'm more and more convinced that Michael worked as an interrogator for the NSA
I love how they censored scars at the beginning but not brodin  Also toast frickin killed me with scarra
Pokimane while holding plushy thingy:  I was gonna do stuff but I can’t do it on camera though Me: somethings wrong I can feel it
My regular heartbeat is already 110~120 wow
"Imagine everyone's naked"  Scarra's heart: Nope, I'm out
I really like the idea behind this one, the activity led to a lot of cool interactions :>
what the fuck am i watching
FED
6:28 kids watch this channel,] right?
This video: wanna watch nothing but blurred out screens and little to no description and give us like?
What was outro song?
Does anyone else think that Lilypichu looks like Mei from overwatch??
Of course she's gonna win, she's the best at malding.
Ngl if you show me a video of someone running like for track my heart rate spikes like crazy
Holy shit
Michael shoudve just cuddled lily
what's the song in the intro called?
Poki's seduction and revenge arcs lol.
Toast is u in premium? 😂
If they fire Brodin I’m not watching any more ever
Intro/Outro song name? thanks in advance
Lmao did poki imply something >?
ok but what if they made brodin do it as well? that would be interesting to see
Fucking Toast 🐐
Like every thumbnail it’s always fucking Michael I mean get more views :/
For Yvonne, why didn't Michael just use his boba ball eyes? XD
Language Brodin
Real talk though: Yvonne had good trigger discipline.
toast still being the 5 brain himself in this video
what a banger background music with katamari, from 1:04
do another one of these videos please so funny
Is this secretly sponsored by the hub
Tentacle
Sus
Scarra sitting down and is at a exercsising bok😂
*I would've put them on a VR with a Horror Game* .
I wonder who the person poki “dislikes”
poki is never gonna stop trying to flirt with lily in front of michael and i'm here for it
I wasn't expecting any of that😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Since when have people liked to see other people get tortured? Are yall actually asking for it, cuz if yall are, then yall need help. Mentally and physically...
When they fire brodin  Otv members: we ran out of content
An offlineTV video that's less than 20 minutes long! What day and age we live in
*How is imagining everybody being naked makes heart rate faster? that's what I watch when I wanna relax. Oh Poki* ...
what is the name of the outro song it bangs hard
corn hub owo
Is it bad I'm looking at this and thinking rookie numbers. My heart rate has topped at 220 bpm
JKNews need to get Toast and Michael on a few episodes.
why isnt yvonne in the description
Finally, offline tv figured out a way to say "ft michael reeves" without saying "ft michael reeves"
poki's "IS THAT A FIST" got me bro
Alternate title: OfflineTV reacts to adult content
Bro toast knows everything HAHAHA
Like lili her new look
something tells me Michael loves this video idea
7:53 Something that rhymes with Bed??
Poor scarra and his resting heart rate
Title of the song?
Katamari music really does bring it all together
I see Brodin is a fan of korea's Running Man  Edit: does anyone know why Lily got triggered by Toast saying he's gonna join the Amigops
according to my 6th sense otv gonna have Micheal on their next 7 videos
"IS THAT A FIST?!" poki 19 july 2021
"is that a fist" "oh sorry" who is she apologizing to LMAOOOO
This was so fun to watch.
Awwee wish Michael gave Yvonne the Death stare lol.
pokis getting a little weird :/
Why is poki so inappropriate in this vid?
if you want to raise someone's blood pressure two words ear rape
This is just fucking torture
whos the guy at 7:52
So who was the guy in the video that politics doesn't like very much? 🤔🤔🤔
Who does poki not like?
This is torture lmaoo
7:55 is it Mizkif??
What happened to otv they are uploading so frequently are they ok 😅😅
"Is she using her leg?"  LOL WTF IS THIS?? Yvonne went to college for this!
Sponsorship next video is p*rnh*b live⚫️🟠
@lilypichu, you look so cute in new glasses <3<3<3 UwU UwU
Hi! Does anyone here knows what is the background song in the transition between the intro to the main video?
I thought Brodin was a sick bastard but apparently he just picked it up off OTV
1:13 the first time i actually heard brodin curse holy shit
Was it michel
Taser and flames sounds like a Michael reeves cover of “through the fire and flames”
Wholesome on how Toast "leaving" Otv make's Lily's heart rate spike.
Really Toast? Reallyyy??? XD
Yvonne scaring herself instead of just poki was super funny
Hats off to Toast for getting that blood flow up and running to Scarra 😂
this is the true meaning of watching with friends
Who were they referring to when they said someone poki doesn't like
who was in the video that poki didnt like?
I like Lilypichu's new look
POTATO
I’m a simple person  I see Michael I click
wow, I lost it with poki coming back for REVENGE on yvonne
I love how this vid is just a free excuse for brodin to see everyone be tortured and in pain
I love how poki was doing and saying the most sussy things
Alternative title: offlinetv reacts to porn ft. Toast
Did OTV just turn torture into a video? Yes, yes they did. 😂
I wonder what video did they show on Yvonnie
I know this is just for fun, but y'all shouldn't play with your heart rates.
Toast is GOATED
Yo wtf is Poki doing
... why
Wondering what would Lily's heart rate be if Michael pretend to propose
Micheals look of dread and terror says it all. That is what relationship is brooooo!
Brodin is always finding new ways to torture them
LETSGOOO
You just can't torture Yakuza, they does that!
WE NEED A UNCENSORED VERSION LMAO
this was a really content
Poki definitely a dom
idk why i love these the most original stuff LOOL
BGM links please?
Man poki is down horrendous
is it bad that im looking at the underlying rhythm trying to see if theres any heart blocks or anything.  Edit: Pause at 7:02 min it looks like Poki has a first degree block because the PR length is more than .20 seconds, each 5x5 box is .20 seconds, one small box within the 5x5 is .04 secs. It looks like Poki ranges around .40-.32 seconds for her PR.
1:29 whats that song called?
Micheal is a fuckin torturer
Now we know what Yvonnie's heart rate is when she yells at toast during her streams lol. This was such a great video!
Aa
Damn, offlinetv made a unsensored play list
Can anyone tell me the name of the song used in like the intro?
same scarra, my resting heart rate is the same as my stressed out heart rate
The title sounds like they started a electrical fire burning the place down.
When poki tazerd Yvonne she looked mean
toast giving no reaction reminded me of micheal's "cool as a cucumber, classic Toast" 😂
Nice too see Michaels favourite child again
The amount of screaming is immaculate
Poki: "what if some day you stop filming otv videos to film otv porn?" Toast: *im about to do whats called a pro gamer move*
bro toast’s resting heart rate is a nice 10 BPM faster than everybody else
Once toast said "how do you get a men's blood flowing" I got up and locked the door
4:50 HAHA WTF 😂
Lily could lap dance Michael
Michael definitely was a patient at Arkham Asylum.
This is awesome, i love it
If Brodin was on the hot seat, hhis heart rate would stay at a nice even 50
My average heart rate is 43 lol. I've had doctors joke about how i'm actually not alive lol.
Holy shit Michael can do the heart thing too? I thought it was just me
Michael, when you were trying to increase Lily's heart rate, you missed the obvious choice, pulling out a ring
When it was lily's turn I thought Michael was gonna go in one knee and fake a proposal, that'd be insane
Yvonne gone Akimbo with scarra.
Scarra : whats your favorite cathegory Outro : Fist 🤛
poki with lily: what do u think would work? ❤️☺️ poki with yvonne: HOW MUCH *taser* JUICE DOES THIS *taser* TASER HAVE
(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
Toast is a genius
How did this video turn into 18+ in just a few minutes?!
What was the song in the beginning?
Poki was just "is that a fist?"
Arson and electricity my faviorite
Rolling Star!!! Katamari Demaaaacy!
when the fuck did poki get freaky
Yvonne should see a cardiologist jesus
What was the song at intro? The japanese one
4:14 revenge on the Don
What's the name of the song they used during the intro and outro?
great vid
whoever chose the We Love Katamari OST for this video thank you so much
Lol our boy scarra ain’t no simp
Michael shoudve got any ring and proposed to lily to spike her heart rate
Toast strikes with the 5Head plays once again
"Then how do you get a man's blood flowing" The line that turned everyone on through the whole goddamn video
MICHAEL KIDNAP ME. I WOULD LIKE TO BE TASED AND I VOLUNTEER TO BE YOUR TEST SUBJECT
''video of someone who poki doesnt like very much" *now, i wonder who that could be*
The Outro is : *Lonely Rolling Star* (about 1:25 in the song)
7:00 Michael been a dad with lily 😂
Yvonne almost got to xQcs resting heart rate
What's with Lily and the 4 Amigops?
Music an S+ 👍
You guys should do one of those amazon item series' like Matthias does.
Toast is fine
now I really want to see the uncensored version
What's the song used in the outro? lol
I appreciate the katamari damaci music
What is that Outro song ? I NEED IT
Offline TV tries torture. lol
What is the name of the outro song??
This is Michael in video form
What’s the song?
What are the songs use in the beginning and end?
Toast: and how do you get a mans blood flowing Me: slit his wrists
Katamari is an insta-like for me.
Michael is finding way too much joy in using torture techniques on his gf lmfao
this is the most random thing i have ever witnessed
brodin’s days are numbered
L E G G I N G!
Peter and Wendy better react to this one
Fun vid. Good execution Brodin.
I’m a simple man… I see an OTV video that involves tazing  I click
Michael what’s ur fave coding language
So the blind people's hearts didn't react as much as the people with no glasses
HOLY FUCK I REMEMBER THIS SONG FROM KATAMARI DAMACI
too little flame and tasers, i need more.
Why does Michael without glasses look like Tom Holland x Harry Potter
What is the ending song
micheal should have just gotten on one knee with a small box in his hand pretending to marry Lily.
What’s the song?
I havent finished the video but i love that theyve been using more katamari music. Probably because all of those games have killer soundtracks :>
You know shits boutta get real when they pull up the *hub*
intro/outro song?
Did Lily create the intro/outro music?
Lily's reaction when Toast said he's leaving OTV to join the Amigops makes me question things 🤔🤔🤔🤔
The poor OfflineTV logo keeps getting bullied every intro
this was a weird one
poki: "i feel uncomfortable knowing that we're all looking together" also poki: takes a peek- "is that a fist??" it appears the angel has fallen
Intro/outro song???
Let's get 1M likes on this video!!! 😩😩😩😩😩
Toast with the genuia
we all know that yvonne is the easiest to get a spike of heart rate she screams all the time even for stuff that arent scary
no one's gonna talk about how Toast just searched up "****hub" on the laptop while recording a video :> my mann
Everyone:HAHAHA scary poopy funny Toast: *DEGENERATE TIME BOIS*
I was dying after this 5:59
The fact lily has evolved beyond pokis charms is the character development we needed
Yvonne was doomed to fail lol
Anyone got the outro song for me?
Scarra: "we're friends right?" Poki: "Somethin like dat."
tazers and flames, i didnt think they would make a video about my kinks
Im glad Yvonne is actually participating in these now. I know she's not "technically" in the OTV Member Group officially but we all see her that way. Hope they continue to have her join in consistently because it does make it better
5:09  toast pulled the trump card
Pog
Michael payed the most attention to Toast's site search. Explains alot, actually.
Michael had some fun in this one
poki stays pervy lmao
Is it just me or is Poki acting a bit too sus in this video?
Lily using the laptop looks like a comfy goblin 😂😂😂
lily should of showed the video where he did k-pop with her and i think aria
poki and toast make the vids
✌🏼more like ✊🏼
0:02 i see u mykull and lily x
Lmao my. God
Lily is so used to Michaels shenanigans most of his stuff barely scares her at this point
More
Wow same heart rate, COUPLE GOALS POG
OTV tortures each other for content
Wooooooooo!!!!! Violence is funnn
Whos the person that poki doesnt like??
I wanna know the music for the intro/outro because it really slaps
you're lonely rolling starrrr~
7:53 who's that??
"video yvonne is ashamed of" me: BADGER BADGER BADGER BADGER
Who else was waiting for yvones heart rate being 0
0:00 Michael and Lily caught in 4K
7:54 Who it be tho
Yo this gotta be breaking some rules
pain
new vid wooooo
lily and michael are now so disgustingly in love that they synced their heartrates, wtf xD
This is by far the video I laughed the most from OTV
Everytime I watch an OTV vid, I think "ohmygodicantbreathe, this is my fav  vid"...and then the next one comes out
Toast knew exactly how to trigger Lily lmao
Micheal tried sensory overload Just an everyday activity at the offline tv house
Uhhh wow, OTV went a long way this video.
Title should be OTV watches the hub together xD
Hey Michael when the hell u gonna upload again my dudr
The first thing they try is PH. And of course it’s toast
Love the Katamari music
7:56 who is this?
What is the intro song?(music blackground)
LMFAO WTF KINDA KINKY SHIT DID HE PULL UP?
bro my medication can just cause my heart rate to go to 200 if i take too much i got this
Damn the more I watch you the more I wanna met all of you I wish that can happen
The song title??
Brodin: He can consciously control his heart rate  *Flashback to mind control car video*
*"IT THAT A FIST??!??"*  *"WHY DOES THAT LOOK LIKE A FUCKING OCTOPUS?!!!?"*
No ones gonna talk about the OTV logo boi getting his head bonked in? 🥺
Is it just me or did offline TV members got more hornier?
how much for the unedited clips ?
Those poor neighbors..
Purposely keeping our queens feet away from us I see mr editor
Scara: we’re friends, right?   Poki: something like that, yea.
Wtf did I watch
New title for this video we try to make people have heart attack =]
Just reading the title i know that Michael is the one doing this
...my resting heart rate is 138😂
Toast should've searched for League
If another member of OTV gets cut for doin' some fuck shit that made people uncomfortable, this video will 100% be one that gets bombarded with "well this didn't age well" comments.
Toast and Michael were in their element this vid.
Maybe the real punishment were all the *insert adult content name here* they've seen along the way?
Lily’s heart rate just decreases over time after she saw Michael trying to also stop his heart rate
Scarra was subjected to borderline torture
Michael and lily's kiss at the beginning of the video..💕
Brodin has F******* them up so much that after literally torturing one another they STILL thought there was a punishment! 🤣🤣🤣
the first thing i thought of was michael opening his eyes lol
brodin: you're goal is to make everyone's heartrate go up  michael:  *intense clapping*
i see tazers , i click
Title of the ending song pleaseee
Poki: " What do you think maybe would spike your heart rate involving me" Me: Ayooo What?!
Death was calling yvonne
Dang I thought Michael and lily would kiss or something, it's literally just that easy lol
Where is the CRACKHEAD!!!
You could mistake this for Michael’s video lowkey 😂
We need their search history asap.
Toast a Real Genius
this gave me anxiety lol
I would be shit at this.
*Poki ideas are kinda kinky* 😏
I wish I could see all the videos they blurred out lmaoo
Lily looks so great with her new haircut!
ah shit, susan waikiki is coming for you
no michaels 12 he cant do that he didnt get his parents permission yet
I actually enjoyed this video, since the starting part was kinda mature
it's always great when we have electricity and fire
They should have a separate video about porn fetishes...idk it's just an idea
This reminds me of a similar challenge in taskmaster, where if I remembered correctly someone just coffee boarded Alex
I feel like if one or two of the girls would have just sat on Scarra's lap, his heart rate would have skyrocketed. Being an easy win, in my opinion of course.
0:01 did anybody notice lily kissed michael?
I think a more fitting title to this video is "OFFLINE TV REACTS TO PORN!! - OFFLINETV HEART RATE CHALLENGE"
I feel like Brodin enjoyed this one even more than other videos
Poki being creepy to lily was very weird ngl
Toast is just too smart🧠🧠
Yvonnie has 2 hearts for her kindness ^^
I want to see a longer version of this
I'm still trying to figure out what their favourite category is
Should have done the heart rates from the HR department, I bet those would have beaten Yvonne by a lot
Whats the intro song?
Do you win if you give someone a hart attack
4:55 Toast ur a goddamn genius
next video title: OTV WATCHES WHAT!!??
They deleted my favorite "okbai"  vid
OMG we need more Yvonne in future otv videos, the whole part where they spiked her heart rate was just so funny
POYO
what song was that in the ending
I find it funny how the group reacts to p*** like fourth graders
Poki: I’m relaxed  *Heart rate goes up to 90 BPM*
4:57 look at all the girls looking away and both guys just starring
-Poki "is that a fist?"
They should have all kissed toast. I‘m sure that would have worked. Emotions 🙃
Why hasn't Michael posted in 3 months on YouTube
What was the song at 2:50?
The easiest way to get their heartrate would be to look at pokimane's simp's "drawings"
am i the only one that thinks toast looks so god damn good
Censored everything in this damn video, except for the one thing they censor in every video, if you know what I'm talking about you're fucking weird
Why does poki think of such random shit bro 😭😭(imagine them all naked )
I have sooo many questions!!! What did they watch to make Yvonn heart rate go so up
9:13 lucky women
Lily’s new glasses look so good!
Can anyone tell me the video Yvonne is ashamed of?
whos that at 7:55 ?
Does anyone know what the ending song is
What app were they using?
I feel like poki was being more chaotic then Michel witch is new
What is the name of the song of the intro and outro
does anyone know the song that starts around 1:05 it's clearer around 1:29 if that helps edit: turns out it's the outro song as well
drop
What is the name of the song
The finger gun ready did it for me 😂
They should have put the heart rate sensor on Yvonne and made her do the outro without fucking up haha
The song from the intro/outro it's "Lonely Rolling Star" - Katamari Damancy
kinda miss the old otv, but damn u guys got big in popularity
whats the ending song name?
bro the intro song is so good, does anyone know what it is?
SCARRA WON!!!
5:46 Micheal was like I'm using that later
What is that song. I need to know.
the reason lily was not affected by the tazer because it happens everyday
Who does poki not like?
Toast really know how to have some fun 😂
Poki never misses any chance to kiss Lily lol
"So whats your favorite category?"  "...OKAY BYEEE"  😂
Dam when toast did the thing all I can think is they now have a closer connection 😂
“Is that a fist” 😭 I’m dead
At this point I’m waiting for Offline TV reacts to Porn.
13 minutes of Offline TV members torturing each other.
Next video Michael commits arson
It is so funny especially yvonne
I need to know the intro/outro song, pleaseeeeeee
you know theyre all out of shape gamers when none of them even get into the 60s or lower for resting heart rate
Can we get OTV Fishing
I’m thinking Poki is going more and more bottem left corner
Who can beat Scarra being chill among them, LOL.
Whats the songgggggg
What was the song at the end?
i always love the intro songs to these chaotic vids, its like the calm before the storm.
Good job Brodin👍
I hate the fear that Poki has when Yvonne has the taser.
im so glad im not the only one who can “control” my heart rate like michael
Can anyone tell me where they got those slingshot wooden guns?
does anyone know the song from the outro?
Me watching this while eating breakfast was a bad move...
lily looked like a teacher with 3 child
This is evidence that Toast doesn’t have a heart:)
They should do amongst with the heart rate
Egg wars
I want a chaotic friend just like Poki
Toast trying to use cheats.
Okay now this is the shit I subbed for
Love that Pokémon emerald music in the back
Alternative title: Torture
1:30 bro whoever did that is so good at editing
"video of someone nPoki doesn't like very much" MonkaS
lie detector but cheap
10:56 ah the negotiator
“Is that a FIST” -pokimane under a rlly weird situation ✌️
What song is in the background? Sounds like Lily's
anyone know the intro/outro song? *since they decided not to link it in the desc*
Otv audience gas 3 factions,                           1-normal viewers                                              2-pokimane simps                                           3-the ones that come because of Michael and toast
Michael was rioting in this vids pitch meeting.
The hub 5:10
Im so glad Yvonne is getting included more in OTV videos. SHES SO AMAZING and funy!
where do you get that blanket i want it
Yvonne at the end: Ok Byeee
5:08 this is what I call family bonding
"a video of someone poki doesn't like"  Me: i think thats fed
Anyone know the intro song
(for scarra) "go through his twitter, look through his liked posts, find the girls" oh boy they'd be surprised to find the vtubers
Poki can't control her Doki.
Jokes on them I have cardiomyopathy! My heart rate is always at least 120.       (Haha funny but I'm not joking)
whats the ending song?
Music from start?
Poki kinda wild this vid
Leafy? 7:52
I just wanna ask to micheal reeves, what hapoen to the crude oil he got on Christmas last year?
OTV is gonna freak out when that one guy in the comments leaves links to all the videos they are referencing
Why am I so early
Toast was not wrong.
Looks like some dum shit a 12 ur would do
"Hi I'm Michael" and that was the lethal move
As someone with a resting heartbeat of 40-50, this sure was an eye-opener
Fisting is Poki's fav, we all know that
toast is looking very nice 😈
Poki was out of pocket this episode lmao
ofc toast pulls up the hub
NOW I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE LEGGING AND FISTING.
Anyone know the outro music and in the start of the challenge?
Heheheh
ah yes, Michaels biggest fear, *HIMSELF*
why does Michael looks dead inside?? oh my I laughed so hard I dont know why😅
Woah stop children are watching... they really should make a ph channel to broaden their audience
Yoooo 2 hour gang
"Tasers and flames" an avarege Michael video
I was beginning to wonder if michael forgot tasers existed
Lily is so used to Michael's shenanigans by now, she can stay completely calm against everything at this point.
Poki's whole strategy is just *H O R N I*
Anybody know what that ending song is?
Wait did anyone see Michael and lily kiss<3 0:02
omg did they look up a video of fed? 7:53
Video of someone Poki doesn't like hmm.. Certain someone: 2/10
We learned two things today 1: toast knows what men want 2: Poki has no idea how to be seductive
The guy that Lol I hates that Michael pulled up is probably Fed. Pretty sure.
Good job
Tasers, flames and Michael? Must watch video!
The fuck did Poki drink before this lmao
THANK YOU GOD FOR BLESSING US WITH ANOTHER OTV VIDEO!!!!!!!!! These give me life <3
Toast comes up with some of the funniest shit I've seen and that was a smart move
I think, that Yvonne is ashamed of video when she watched the clip with badgers) ( “Badger, badger, badger ,badger, MUSHROOM, MUSHROOM”)
I like this     Anyway wats your fav category
I'm losing my mind trying to figure out where I know the intro and outro song from, shazam is no help, for some reason I feel like it's from a katamari game but can anyone help me out
Dude Scarra's resting heart rate is 99?!  Scarra, if you read this you gotta take care of yourself, man. Don't stress too much.
Love that you used the Katamari Damacy song :)
9:34 does anybody see the mistake
anyone else thinking that POKI WAS FUCKING WILDING????
My normal heart beat is like 124 a minute
Michael and his mom are so funny
I feel bad for Dunois seeing that he had more screentime seeing the r18 stuff cause of the editing '-'
"Michael can control his heart rate"  Fucking hell why wouldn't he be able to do that
You know it’s bouta go down when scarra gets the guardian music ⛄️
Well played Brodin.. 😂😂
who was the person poki doesnt like
whats hte outro music \
What was the song at the beginning?
If i went on this my heart rate would be through the roof lmao
BRODIN GIVE US THE BACKGROUND MUSIC THANK YOU
ironically the end of the video kinda looked like a group therapy
toast is the batman of otv
Everyone on the couch: it’s all harmless fun well only yell at you from here Yvonne: immediately pulls out a gun
my higheast bpm was 206bpm and my lowest was 30bpm
What the outro song?
How much of coffee Yvonnie had before this? Double!?
That melodica video is the first LilyPichu video I watched lmao
I love how Brodin's HR goes down after Poki's suggestion. Dude was like: "Well I expected one day this might happen." 🤣
Brodin should've joined them on this one
Anyone know the background sound title used in the video?
"Is that a fist"
Can I have the song please
I like poki's 200 IQ response 6:02
Lily is starting to look more and more like a  mom...
8:40 just watching some nopor with the homies
All I got from this video is yvonne is either a virgin or she’s only hooked up with mandingos
Honestly the mannequins in the BG be a mood though
What is that outro song?
The most r-rated otv vid
Everyone: tasers and threats Toast: Reject society, return to Horni
Toast: How do you get a man's blood pumping? Me: uh oh TOAST _NO_
Well.. this is going to spark some interesting fan fiction I imagine
just snort the good stuff           crushed ghost pepper
7:53 who do you think it was? LOL
pog
07:55 whos this guy?
me with a resting heart rate of 120: guess ill die
Anybody know what the outro song was?
anyone know the outro song?
2:00 Sonic unleashed spagonia day music. Who's the one who picks the songs in these you got some good taste.
Does anyone know the song for the intro and outro?
Honestly, if Michael acted sexily or flexing his body. Lily's heart rate would shoot up in an instant(my guess at least!)
"Man, I love being part of the four Amigops" DESTRUCTION: 100
This is baby numbers have you guys never watched geometry dash YouTube
My bpm was 182 once before heart surgery
What is the outro song?
I think Brodin could easily get a higher gig, but only OTV allows him to torture others and letting him unleash his sadistic endeavors. The heart knows what it wants.
Ah yes, like usual, when there is an otv upload, tap faster on the vid than the speed of light.
we are trying to see who can have the highest heart beat rate,  a cardiac arrest : are you challenging me
Who was the guy from that video that poki doesn't like
Poki used to try to be funny now sex is her funny pretty sad
I love todays comment section lmao
Me watching this hoping that I have friends so I can do that with them
DAAAYYYUUUUMMM katamari damacy music
gamer
L E G G I N G ?!
Why is this episode so THIRSTY and I've only made it past 6:00 minutes
Love how she got last place she’s always terrified
New title once toast stood up to torture Scarra is just  “offlinetv looks at por* together”
These average heart rates remind me of how during peak training for running my average hr was like 40-45 >.>
Man, with all that screaming, I sure hope the house is well insulated for sound. Neighbors will wonder who they are killing in there otherwise.
Poki went from trying to be cute to executioner
Why is Yvonne not mentioned in the description?
This video overall was just out of context for sure lol Especially from Toast and Poki's side
Poki does nothing to Lilly but comfort her
fart
Fun fact: women have naturally higher heart rates then men so this was kinda unfair
Just tô back to the clássics. Search 2 girls 1 Cup and have Fun!
What song that they used?
I’ll miss you toast. Have a good life after leaving OfflineTV :(
that LOZ:BOTW music gives me flashbacks to my hundreds of deaths
Anyone know that ending song
Remove yovoone form being in vids boring
turns out otsv watches "adult content" together...
Loki this is fine
This seems like headphone warning for all the loud screeching
How was I scared by Poki when she had the taser? She straight up terrified me
Why is Michael so used to see the...  *Y’know, what Toast projected in the laptop screen.*
That katamari damacy bgm is so good
7:12 yvonne then: hated tasers yvonne now: * zap *
So hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
Alternative title: OTV watches p0rn
Poki been acting real sus tho
9:17  Poki is THHIIICCKKK
This is getting demonitized dude
wowwwiiii
Myself calls me = michel
This turned dark fast
10:10 oh no Michael found another toy
OTV group videos are some of my favorite YouTube content. How do they not run outta ideas.
I love offline TV videos, but they are so rare :'(
It was all fun and games until toast opened “that” site
michael looks like a budget daniel radcliffe
doki doki plus
Couch can verbally assault you… the couch an Micheal 😏
That Uchiha cap though ❤️
Katamari and mother 3 (ssbb) OST coming in clutch
*I love how everyone is scaring and trying to make Lily uncomfortable but Poki*  She kissed her cheek 😶 So cuteee 😍
I never realized just how ruthless Poki is.     Nor how much hatred Michael held towards his oldest videos.
And then they watched some "family friendly" video together
Hey, what's the song playing in the background around 1:30?
1:14 casually grabs a cucumber
Does torture look like this but worst?
what the f toast
am i the only one that thinks lily looks a lot older then she usually does
Being fat you have higher heart rate
11:36 thats the puyo puyo game song ? LUL
Lily’s new distinctive glasses make her look smarter than what she was.    SHE WAS REALLY SMART BEFORE IMAGINE NOW,  *Lily Supermacy*
yea i think this video will get deleted in few hours
Lilly looks like Velma
If Toast is playing LoL i can see him placing last
90+ resting heart rate: “Wow that’s good”
At this point the English language should just adopt Brodin as the new synonym for *P A I N*
When making a title for this I feel like the title pitch was gonna be who can get the first heart attack 😂😅
There is no way brodin isn’t a hardcore bdsm enjoyer
I never feel safe anymore knowing I live in the same state as Michel
I’ve watched so much hen**i I can depixilate those images
either poki is extremely horney or she took too much caffeine!!!  either way love the energy in this video!! :) lol creative ideas
brodin's ideas suck wtf
I remember my heartrate almost doubling after playing this needlessly long game of wild rift
I thought toast was on to something but nevermind
I fucking love the Katamari Damacy Soundtrack
The punishment should be actually giving them a heart attack
"Offline TV harass each other for 13 minutes and 51 seconds"
5:20 my heartbeat wasnt the only thing going up
9:05
7:54 so who is that
Video so good I had to rewatch it immediately
Remember when this channel used to be just the gang?  *Not anymore. It's Michael, and always will be Michael.*
can we like, pay for patreon or something so we can see the unblurred versions of these? lol
12:18 yes
Toast with the big brain plays
Just a simple question, does someone know the thing they used to monitor the heart rate????
Imane a faim je crois
For lily i would sorta fake punch michael then see what happens
Time to go look up legging.
Otv summary: on the couch looking at PH with the booooooiiiisssssss (not casting couch just regular couch)
Alive cor ♥️
everybody ganster till they start flat lining
already knew from the start that yvonnes gonna lose kekw
Ah yes scarra is a big fan of the famous site known as cornhub I see
never thought among us would be on this channel
9:07 somone knows where is that song from ;-;?
We i am relatively early
Why do I have a feeling Poki's into BDSM lmao
Love how embarrassed Michael is of his old stuff even though that is the Michael we like and want and not this current guy who doesn't post or care about is videos
Yvonne was incredible this episode! You have a new fan!
Most chaotic fucked up and hilarious video they've ever made. 🤣🤣
Does anyone know what the blurred poki and yvonne videos might have been? The poki one I think is leafy but idk
Hey... this song into and outro is from Katamari Damanci
Yvonne trying to explain what she just saw when toast tried against scarra....
toast is the sigma male, he doesn't give into porn KEKW
Nothing like family activities! 5:58
Sheriff Yvonne 🤠
also who is the youtuber at 7:54 who poki doesn't like, is it aceu
Am i the only one who heard spagonia from sonic unleashed in this vid, got tier
The "Holy shit. Poki's having a heartattack" sent me
Man's just built different
Another tasing thing, ANOTHER ARC FOR MICHAEL I SEE
Amogus
My heart rate runs 120 when my anxiety spikes and 140 when I eat gluten
5:01 DID HE JUST TURN ON THE ⬛️🟧
We so needed sykkuno on this one
I give this two days before it's age-restricted lmao.
6:58 does michael have a bald spat? or is that just hairline
7:52 it’s fed isn’t it
I love this video OTV brings me happiness
Honestly all members of the otv does not support Brodin ideas for content but looking at the views it’s working, they all getting that chaching… maybe they will use the earning for more amazing content and for friends.
4:26 Real manly there Scara
Yo toast send me the link to that website that you used on scara
All u need is for me to play a game of valorant
the hub part got me rolling on the floor
Hi
Fun fact when your with you significant other you heart will actually  sync up that's why at 2:20 Lily and Michael heart rate is the same.
bruh I have POTS and IST without my medication my heart rate will go up to 150 just by standing up and 130 just by sitting up hjkhfdjkhfj
Katamari damacy vibe
"Is That A Fist"
I think this is the best OTV video ... dont ask why I enjoyed it so much ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) XD
Just vibing at the Katamari OST
Micheal! Remember Micheal the future
BURN.
Toast is to OTV what Batman is to the Justice League. He knows their weaknesses
does anyone know that song at 1:32? I'll give you a cookie.
I am disappointed Michael didn't scare more people.  He used to terrorize housemates. So disapointing.
Lily rage.
Someone PLEASE tell me what song is playing at the beginning and the end of the video.
toast looks hot
it's past the middle of July and OTV members are sitting in hot ass blankets (don't know how hot it is in the room) but just asking HOW ARE SOME OF Y'ALL HEAT RESISTANT?!  I would sweat my entire to my next reincarnation
they should’ve let toast watch his mother hugging him on stream
We watch otv because Michael doesn’t post enough content lmao
Neat
Poki is the horniest otv member
I wish they kept doing it until they got Toast to crack lmao
NOT THE HUB
hahahahahhahah
Offline TV  !
11:22 Toast didnt react for 3 minutes and nothing worked. hahahahaha.
Anyone know if we’ll ever get more podcast episodes? I recently discovered them and really enjoyed them all!
5:52 Michael straight up becoming Safari Man
poki can be scary
anybody know the intro and outro song?
poki needs to go to horni jail
Brodin needs to go to the Hague for his war crimes
Poki was being a little PogO in this video…
Why was Toast actually....on the right track?
Man... I didn't know what I was expecting but god dang was I not expecting this. A lot of chaos I tell you... A lot of chaos indeed.
What’s the name of the outro?
This video's intro, Katamari Damacy - Rolling Lucky Star, is a bop
Cool
I think it's very funny that Poki trying to seduce both Scarra and Lily dropped their heart rate.
michaels happy place is back
The amount of enjoyment Michael gets from Yvonne's tazer is funny
Michael looks so proud of Yvonne when she pulls out the taser
Even outside Valorant, Yvonne cant be trusted with guns.
This is actually Torturing each other session hahahahaha.  Brodinnnn!!!
Tbh, probably every single viewer would know that Yvonne will be last.
Shout out to Katamari lonely rolling star
Uhhhhh 208 BPM would kill wouldn’t it?? What I always heard was that the mas BPM u can have roams around 220 minus your age  So for me would be about 201 but for Lily it would be 191
No one played Michael's The Boys Laser Eye Baby video for him?
7:35 T: HOLY SHIT, POKI´S HAVING A HEART ATTACK!!! This made me cry. XD XD XD
Demonetized.
God, i laugh so much on OTV videos :D
Poor Yvonne.
Toast knowing all the weaknesses
4:50 i don't like where this is going *me 10 seconds later*: STOP!
anyone know the song played at 1:30
Banger intro song
4:43 Increase man's blood flow. Toast: opens website.  Scarra increse heart rate.  🤣🤣🤣🤣
who was it on the vid that poki didn't like that much? was it fed?
Yo Michael ackt like a crack man dude more ple
9:07
im satysfying the algortthm
HILARIOUS AND ORIGINAL!!!       gonna see if somebody gets the reference
The most sus video
Just saying that song they were playing at the beginning fuckin banged.
Me watching this video: "Brodin? R u ok?"
Unrelated but seeing Poki and lily in blankets makes me so hot since in England temperatures are like 29 Celsius
The amigops lmaoo
Poki: "IS THAT A FIST?"  Like you wouldn't know miss "two fingers? More like a fist"
One day, I will host porn party for entire nations.
This was so beautiful
Holy shit I heard Sonic Unleashed OST at 1:55 (don't mind me juz surprised af)
I like how Poki and Yvonne tried aims rubber band guns and shouting at Scarra but then Toast went about the psychological route
7:52 has gotta be fed
Alternative title: OTV tortures eachother for 14 minutes
What's wrong with toast
No one:  Scarra: So what's your favorite pron category?
What do you guys think about "offline rewind" ?
Wow the Katamari music in the background. I’m glad to know there’s some people that appreciate this underrated game.
Toast said ya let's go straight to the hub
Respect for Brodin reporting in
can we get a recording of the talk Scarra and Michael had after the end of the video
There is no human suffering
Did we just discovery a new youtube genre?  OTV Porn Reaction
0:27  Lily: "Go up and down, doing stuff." Everyone else: .......😬
Lol why is Michael so broken? Like Brodin: Today were doing an obstacle course! ...Also michael learned the fly yesterday so...
What’s the music from?!?!??
whats the name of the outro ?
Toast: ive never done a cringy thing in my life Me: didnt u openly admit to shitting on a highway
Fuck's sake Toast haha  Can't deny it worked a bit though
What’s the name of the song playing in the background of the intro and the part with the otv mascot/character Edit: actually just any of the song names in the whole video
5:56 I thought I was watching Peter's stream
Love the katamari music!!!
does anyone know who is it that poki doesn't like very much?
I wonder if offline tv will ever prank brodin with firing him😂😂
i swear Michael has like 3 shirts
Brodin kinda cute...
Toast: how do you get a man's blood flowing?  Cut his throat. (For legal reasons that's a joke. I do not condone violence.)
My only wish is to be a part of this
1:41 Scarra's heartrate has been added to the Court Record
in any other otv video, I never thought I would see the hub on a otv video
Intro song: your lonely rolling star, katamari damacy
whos the person poki doesnt like
hey jamie i know your watching this make some room for your kit my dogs have been trying to eat it
Dude they could've pull up someone browser history like toast etc
Toast is a legend CHANGE MY MIND.
I regret my life decisions
Alright sweet. Last video was so long ago that now I have a wife and 4 kids
Do you have the uncensored version?
OTV AV by Director Brodin Hmmmmm....????
Every time otv uploads I'm 50% happier
POKI WTH
E v E r S e E n C i R q U e D u S o L e i L
am i the only 1 that hates Michael Reeves and LilyPichu are becouse i remineds that you are lonly 9 ever
intro song?? I've been looking for the name of that song for more than 1 year when fundy started using it
I needed this
5:27 did anyone noticed inappropriate is misspelled LMFAO
"Are we still talking about fisting?"  -Michael Reeves, 2021
I cant focus on anything with Toast looking hot like that 🥴🤤🧎🏼‍♀️
Loving the Katamari music
kids. dont tell ur parents
I find it cute that Lily reacts still to Toast memeing that his leaving otv. lol
4:05 call me daddy jajajjajajahah
Omg that toast bit with the computer was hilarious
Ngl I wish I could have joined in this vid but I feel like I’d be too chaotic
Did I watch this at first moment I saw it? No, I found God's megalovania first
doubling your heart rate can't be good for your quality of life
3:14 not the freaking Guardian music D: just hearing that I get stressed out lmao
Michael can control his heart rate. Also Michaels heart rate is 110
Another cooking competition?
whats the song aT 1:20 ? I i recognize it but havent heard in a LONG time
they should not have drinkin that cofee
michael and lily having the same heart rate is some soulmate stuff
Isn't a heart beat above 145 a fucking health hazard
lilly looks like that one chill aunt who always gives you money
These indoor videos are getting a little old IMO.
Title: TASERS & FLAMES     .... what did Michael do this time..?
who's the person that poki didnt like
Finally OTV notices how crazy pron is “ she’s using her leg in that one”
I can't imagine a kid watching this :)
I got distracted by Brodin s hat. 👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️
Brodin does need a raise i agreeeee!
you guys make my day!
What’s the outro song called???
Brodin could have just said "pink sand" and Yvonne's heart rate would have shot up.
I think we all know who that person was at that part when they blur our entire screen at the end of Poki's turn on the chair if you seen her talk about it before on twitch or some clip.
Poki: see fisting genre Poki: *interested*
Lonely Rolling Star, great choice Brodin
Too shirt needed more offlinetv ._.
The moment I saw tasers I clicked
I'm laughing that poki was using the taser to censor herself "did you think I would forget so *zap* easily?!"
Never would I have thought I'd see OTV watch pron0 together
Omg putting lonely rolling star in there was an amazing decision thank yooouuuu :))))))
THAT MELODICA VIDEO WAS A THROWBACK
I would be concerned if anybody actually got 200 like in the thumbnail cuz most people would’ve died by then
This channel is turning somewhat normal people into a bunch of sadistic freaks. This might go as far as to turn them into bdsm addicts. ( this comment of mine is a sin and i do not regret it, ADIOS.)
They are fucking killing each other in mean of "content" wtffffffff
They should've looked each other up on r34.     That'll get the blood flowing in one of them at least
GOO GOO GA GA POKIMANE MOMMY
13:27 Scarra ready for school pictures
OH NO DAVIKI DONT LOOK AT THAT
Nice
Pun
Yay new vid
This would be easy since I had arrhythmia's as a baby.
ok s
Toast pulling up the "cultured content" and every everyone freaking out was so hilarious 😂😂
Was that Lily's rendition of katamari theme?
hi
I would win this 100% if you just put a niddle in front of me 😂💔
Dang poki hit 136 bpm when Yvonne had the taser.
They grew so much closer to each other after this video.
Me watching this at 1 am   NO
Scarra’s bpm went down at the beginning cause all the blood was rushing to somewhere...
I saw Tasers I click hahaha
Whoah holy shit lily 0:08 I think brodins cool and yes that is because of the challenges her forced you guys to do while video taping it and putting it on the internet
What is the name of the song that they use in the intro and outro??
Geometry dash is the answer
idk if anyone noticed the sonic unleashed music but I love it
yo toast y u crossing yo legs 😏
michael seemed so genuinely happy when he got the same average bpm as lily that's so wholesome
Lily still salty about her no being in the amigops
keep the content coming, they are so good
Honestly all you had to do for Lily was Michael start going fullblown crackhead, go live on her Twitch, and he starts screaming NSFW stuff
Lily best intro. Change my mind.
13:05 Yvonnes voice hurt from shouting??? Is that a first?
*video of someone poki doesn’t like* AKA FED LOL
my favorite category is sfm
i am sorry to the editer who had to sit through that and blur it all out
I can't wat for someone with an actual medical degree to analyze their EKG's
How to make Yvonnes heart rate go up?  Talk about big rocks
Just thinking that it'll take 2 weeks for next video is enough to double my heart rate.
Meow
What is the name of the intro and outro song???
otv: has 70-100bpm xQc doing a heist on nopixel: ''you gotta bump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers''
Glad we all collectively watched porn together, like family.
Imaging doing this with sykkuno😄
I think everybody here can collectively agree that Michael was holding back in fear of killing all the other mortals in the room.
YES A OTV UPLOAD
Scarra looks especially scrumptious this video
What is the song called they used for the intro/outro?
7:54 wait was that Fed?
Just put Lily in a Valo game to get her heart rate up, LMAO
does anyone know the intro song at 1:30 ?
Toast made a real genius galaxy brain move here.
Who comes up with these video ideas and are they okay?
5:36 scarred fav
chat who know the song name ^^
Poki is fucking insaneee😭😭😭😭😭
3:46 yvonne pointing at both head *wink wink*
michael screaming fuck you and shut the fuck up is scary. like the way he said that just sounds completely different from his normal voice and behaviour
Damn what's the intro and ending song
*There is no way in hell this video is getting monetized*
Intro/Outro song? I think I've heard this one before but I can't remember the name of it.
OMG that was painful but I love it.
I’m surprised they didn’t flat out search for otv *adult entertainment* that would’ve been too much
this is fun
I am now deeply curious what this video Yvonne is ashamed of is
I don’t get toast saying ( love being part of four amigops )
6:55 Lily: wait does this work? *shoots elastic band at roof accidentally* Michael: *Takes gun off Lily* yes.
this episode had me in tears laughing -
Pain poggers
Is everyone okay, now?
Can we take a second to admire Poki’s never ending quest to seduce Lily
This is the first time I feel like I've seen some form, even though tiny, of panic in Michael's eyes
My idea tase them
Ah yes otv's monthly circlejerk i have been waiting for this one
WHAT THE....... *FAINTS FROM ALL THE LAUGHER*
Polis always the funniest
"This is the first time, you have refused to punish us" Brodin bringing people out of the closet
You know its a good video when there's micheal and taser involved in it.
I lost it When Micheal just completely dropped his disgust and went “is she using her leg in that one?”
What's the song on the outro?
The crackhead Is strong in this one
Intro and outro song ?
Please make 1 thousand more heart rate episodes. Or else.
Me and Michael can both control our heart rate I have something in common with G O D
aye im a straight dude but toast is actually attractive
why is is that the first thing i notice when i start the video is that micheal and liky kiss ;-; they're so cute 💞💞😭
I don’t know why but I wanna search up fisting because of poki saying why does it look like an octopus and because I love octopus
otv posts 😩
When Yvonne pulled out the taser I thought Michael would use it on everyone 😭🤣
yvonne isnt even listed in the offlinetv roster?
This is just a way to write a p0rnhub premium subscription as a business expense.
"He can consciously change his heart rate" Of course Michael of course.
OfflineTV to FlatlineTV.
Poki has a lot pent up sexual feelings
I'm I the only one whose heart rate was increasing just by WATCHING this video...  I would be SO screwed if i ever did this
I know exactly how to get Lily's heart rate up. Have Michael properly make out with her right there and then LOL.
You want Micheal to freak tf out?         Show him pictures of a mess of tangled up wires
I like these more casual videos that have been done recently rather than these big videos that we get one of a month or 1 in two months. It reminds me of old OTV
While watching this video: Main thought: Hahaha! This is so fun! 😂 Secondary thought: I am worried about Scarra's cardiovascular health. 😅
HorniTV
that's a typical bigbrain move from Toast.
4:48 the others are playing checkers while toast is playing chess
ig the whole video was punishment enough but... I'm probably down for part 2! lol
Brodin is best otv member ngl
Brodin has been doing a great job. Keep it up!
7:54 I think it’s Fed. I’m not sure though.
What was that song in the intro and outro?
The taser was a double edged sword against Yvonne
Lmfao they should put Boku no Pico on 😂
For those of you who want to know, the song from the intro and outro are from a game called Katamari Damacy. The song title is Lonely Rolling Star. Enjoy!!
I need more of this
Wow this video is very risky
Lily have lower heart beat rate because she feel dead inside
this was pretty enjoayable again. No disgusting punishment or something, just stupid fun :)
Anyone know what the background music is at the beginning
Bet Toast put either Leafy or Keemstar on the TV
This video is gold hahahaha great job guys!
welcome to offline tv sexually assault each other
I wonder what would happen if they called Sykkuno and have him talk to Toast on the phone >:) Will Toast's heart rate go up?
WHAT WAS THE SECRET OF YVONNE'S SHAME?
What we learned from this is lily is the calmest under pressure
Video went from 0 to 100 real quick after Toast spiked Scarra's heart rate.
me: * reads title * "michael's time has come"
Me and the homies getting "the talk" from our parents 6:25
he opened the PHUB
Been waiting for a new otv video!
"Video of someone Poki doesn't like" Why do I feel like it's Fed?
So that's why all the guys wore black pants ...
Michael and Lily truly are meant to be with the same resting heart rate.
For those wondering, the song is Lonely Rolling Star from Katamari Damacy.
Are we still talking about fisting?  -Michael Reeves 2021
I’d let Daddy Poki tase me any day! 😂
so since i'm in a different time zone, these videos come out at night, and I got real lucky pulling an all-nighter tonight
yayayyayayayayayaya
Michael’s very interesting influence on OTV’s showing
Brodin: Michael can consciouly control his heart rate  Me: He can WHAT?!?
What is the song that is playing in the background, at the beginning and at the end?
Kinda wish we saw more of everyone else's reactions
whats the intro and ending song its so familiar
gotta love the katamari music✨
We need an un censored version of this somewhere
Toast understood his assignment😹
"The couch can verbally assault you"  Toast: I'm gonna do what's called a pro gamer move
35 minute crew  Perceived 557th comment
I’m uncomfortable
5:49 micheal: "legging?" how about kicking
Poki is really embracing her villain arc
The fact that Michael can change his heart rate on command just kinda makes sense
otv, i. l i k e. c h i c k e n
What a great idea Brodin.. Never seen something like this.. 👍👍👌👌👌
I loved that vid  toast was not fazed from the adult website lol and how they said so what was your fav category to evon at the end lol I died laughing and how they had Micheal with the freaking tazer I loved that vid
Tasers and Flames with this title this better be Micheals Onlyfans
Aaaaahhhh... that katamari music...perfection!
what was that edit @3:33 lmao
What's the outro song?
I love yvone screams
I've seen higher heart rates of people playing video games like they can be at 190 heartrate
When toast said he knew how to increase blood flow i assumed he was going to cut scarra
I was just thinking when y’all were gonna release a new video, then I saw this video!   Toast raising everyone’s heart rate when he was supposed to do Scarras 😂😂😂
Michael should have become a FBI interrogator
Intro song?
outro song?
So did you guys let Micheal come up with one
That kiss behind Brodin's head was so sweet.
Michael's calling
There should had been some slime to pit on Lily.. remember the slime challenge 🤣🤣🤣
me:*reads the title* my brain:*through the fire and the flames starts playing*
I knew where toast was going, and i had a feeling what he's gonna search  And that intro by Poki aged like milk thanks to toast
"what should we do for the next video?"  "How about torture?"
katamari music = like
OTV is getting hornier by the second.
Cool
wow... Toast's strategy actually worked
what is the song in the intro
Anyone know what the name of the intro and outro music of the video was?
Tasers and flames, hmmmm I wonder who's idea was this *cough* *cough* Michael *cough* *cough*
This video is Michael's calling
How is Brodin still working for OTV...
whats the outro tune?
Honestly? They didn't use Michael nearly as much as they should have. I just happened to watch the hide and tase recently, and dear god they probably all had 130+ heartrates.
Michel looks like harry potter but if puberty hit him hard and he took taser infused cocaine.
NGL poki walking around Yvonne with a taser was terrifying lmao.
I'm wondering what/who poki hates
Every Offline TV video is a banger! Love their content!!!!
Why don't they just talk about leaving and joining a cringe content group like hype house like toast did when lily was sitting scarra would spike to ???bpm
Scarra's resting heart rate raises my heart rate
Family friendly
This is where the fun begins
12:15, never seen a more perfect person to play an American version of Harry Potter.
0:01 look at lily and mykull
HRLO
offline tv is a cool youtube channel
Sad they didn’t show the videos ☹️
Who is the person pokimane doesn’t like?
Name of the intro music?
Hello beautiful people! Would someone kindly let us know what song is played in the outro? Thank you lots and lots and lots!
soo... what's the song called?
Michael has been waiting all his life for this to happen
Half hour gang!!!
I kinda wanna see Brodin participate in the challenges too!
Bruh I JUST got katamari damacy refill then the intro plays and I’m just like-
Bruh this is just OTV reacting to HornPub
OTV definitely left out something in the title, I wonder what it was... 🤔
Scarra do be asking the real question. "What's your favorite category?"
IS THAT A FIST??? - Pokimane, 2021
Omg 🤣🤣🤣🤣 toast actually looked that up to raise scarra's heart rate I'm dying
Big M reeves
stop :( lily & micheal have the same average heart rates cryin
epic
i love that rolling star from katamari in the intro
w
Toast be chillin 😂😅
Honestly love that they kept the toast painting in the back
At least one sight will have a viewership increase after the incident with scarra
5:55 And that is how Peter got part of his sub alert
TASERS?????????
GO GOG <333
What’s the song in the intro?
"mykul can change his heart rate" yes sir,he is build different
When toast went on the hub I legit starter crying because I was laughing so hard
This video made up for the bad day I had, thanks alot xD
Ah yes, it was Micheal’s turn to pick the next video.
Tbh this is one of the funnist videos i ve seen this month
Micheal would be perfect for the cia interrogation department
"IS THAT A FIST?"  yes poki, in some languages it is referred to as "fisting"
Yes.
13:32 "We watched so much porn today, together"  That's some next level friendship right there
*sees taser* Ahhh yes it’s been a while old friend
Think I got here before OwO, I’m happy
Katamari music!!
Probably the best way to raise a heart rate is to start choking them until they signal that its too much. Then you pretend like you don't plan on stopping. That and literally throwing them up in the air, but that would only work with Lily
Clasic Toast cool as a cucumber
13:39
New ITV vid noice
How do you get a man's blood flowing??? Fisting 😂
Pls pls pls regulate her screams more, this is terribly loud holy fuck, does this person have any expressions without screaming
Punish me Brodin 😩
THIS VIDEO WAS VERY FUCKING INTERESTING
Demonization
This is just torture tactics
yayayay
YOU 20 MINUTES
Ok but here me out....bring otv’s friends and do this again!!
Don't even need to watch to know that I should like this vid
YES
The Beautiful (?)  Katamari music in this hectic video is so ironic
What the fuck is this
Toast showing prnhub lmao😂
That way that tv rests on two separate tables gives me so much anxiety.
“So what’s your favorite category” “Ok bye” Seems about right
I fucking swear Poki has a crush on Lily or something.
Would’ve been sick if y’all brought in like some scary ass dude to interrogate you lol
Damn I'm starting to think they're running out of ideas
Where did you guys get the Jägermeister from?
Brodin has the best ideas 🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥
THIS IS THE MOST CURSED VIDEO THEY HAVE EVER PUT OUT IM SCARED PLEASE HELP ME
this content is interesting
yvonne gets put through the most in these videos
my young fragile mind is now forever scarred
okay but toast....
Half of the video really is just watching adult entertainment with the homies
They can't fire Brodin! This content is exactly why I'm here! xD Who needs Jackass when you have OTV? This is actually watchable.
Fisting
9:24 "Man I love being a part of the four Amigops.  I'm gonna leave OfflineTV and join them" - Toast  OH MY GOD LMAOOO 😭🤣🤣
People: otv is really wholesome and family friendly  otv: watching and reacting to fisting AND SHOWING IT
Toast is king of content!
Give me 2 quad espressos and a Doubleshot and I'll blow this challenge out of the water!  I actually did this once in college because coffee doesn't do much for me. Needless to say, after drinking this, I was on the highway for 20 minutes before I realized I left my car at home. 😐
This was a great way to debut otv porn watching parties. Well done content directors
i appreciate the katamari music in the intro
i love how lily was so grossed by the hub at first and then was fine searching up among us lmao
They should have just taken the glasses off and threaten to destroy them xd
Holy shit, this is Michael’s time to shine
Poki’s deffinetly a sadist!
7:53 guessing it's fed
Sponsored by pornhud lamo
I don’t feel like there was a winner here
*Sees title*  o no
99 resting heart rate is so bad omg scarra
Poki is actually a menace to society LMAO
Why do I feel like they were all waiting for this day to come-
micheal knows how to torture
Everyone else: Let's scare them.  Toast: H o r n i
lol is this why Michael was slowing his heart rate in Lily's vlog when Toast was feeling his pulse? lol
micheal should work with electro boom
:D
There is nothing more terrifying than micheal welding fire
what can we take away from this video? that Michael is amazing at finding embarrassing videos of the other otv members and finding new fun ways of torturing them
Voluntary torture.
How did Yvonne get scared by her own taser
7:51 who was it that Poki didn't like?
"We watched so much p_ today." - Scarra 2021.
Please make this a series omg
why is poki so horni in this video
W video
Finally, a video were tasing is involved
This the weirdest otv video forsure
You guys should do something with your discord
toast: man i love amigops lily's heart rate: 📈📈📈
As a ROR2 and payday player the only thing that would spike my blood would be a malachite spawn noise followed by a cloaker noise
I thought Micheal would be the best but toast is surprisingly good at this
6:58 mykul is now officially babysitting lily at this point
Is that a fist?
FUCK IM LATE 13 MINUTES
yes
noicce
yoo
5:09 They really went on PH
balls
Michael is worryingly versed in torture tactics. He's like a rogue KGB asset.
alternate title: Michael takes revenge for making him drink the bts shake
6:58 michael’s face lol 😂 he’s really scared of lily with that gun
Why is Poki surprised by the fist she has experience…
Poki saying 'is that a fist' like she doesn't know
Why has Poki had these dirty thoughts these couple of videos
8:30  It seems Michael was trying to replicate project MKUltra
Less gohhh
LOL the hub for scarra
Scarra's 99 heart-beat at rest is not good. He really needs to see a doctor, maybe get on some meds. Not trying to insult him, but losing some weight would help too.
I like the fact that they were bullying yvonne for being pure and not watching the hub
21553th.
Toast is a genius
Michael is tazer and fire guy now
Editor with the Katamari Damacy background music. Top tier taste.
Toast: how do you get a man's blood flowing?  Wait a minute.
If you wanna know how to really spike a heart rate, get someone to play blue xenith with hdhr, and fc it.
i might need that octopus videos link...of course for a friend
This was made for michael LOL
I think the title doesn't do justice to the video. It shud be otv reacts to pornhub 😂
Who else turns OTV videos into try not to laugh challenges
I came expecting surprises and torture and I must say this was not expected
Toast is a genious!
Poki: is that a FIST?
when poki starts seducing lily 😭😭
is just me or is poki been uk "growing"
7:12 Yvonne has become what she had once feared
I know a Way that will get Michaels heart rate up, Poki and Lily reminding him about the pong game where they spooned 😈😂😂😂
This is definitely Michael's idea
Whoever causes a heartattack is an automatic winner
just do cocaine
5:55 I thought I had Peter's stream moment for a second
OTV being safe once again
Ah yes another normal day in the office. “This is fine”
Yesss you guys uploaddddddddd
i was waiting for another exciting offlien tv video 😍
early
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Toast being toast is probably the funniest thing I’ve seen all week
7:53.. Is "he" who i think "he" is?
"Call me daddy"  -Poki 2021
why is the description only say that scarra and poki are part of OTV
.
Yay OTV
Damn 310 comments in 8 minutes
Micheals face lit up when he saw the taser 😂
I fully expected after Michael messed with them all, for his turn, Lily just walks up and his heart rate shoots 😂
Poki was hella sus this video 😂
wasd
At this point, I think Brodin just wants to see everyone in pain
Yo, those blankets man
I've got a feeling this will be demonitized lol
Damn not polo… poki
Grounded Grounded Grounded. All of you are grounded. None of you are free from sin.
Ah yeeees a new video
What the fuck.
When is polo gonna pick winner for the NZXT thing
i need to know where they got those cute blankets the girls are using! so pretty!
from my experience, the site toast went on for scarras turn starts with a P
Only 14mins 🥲
toast’s thinking is far more way than others, pulling up the hub on scarra
Toast 100000 IQ
This feels like an he violation
Nice toast
0:02 they kissed no wayyyu
“The couch can verbally assault you” -Brodin 2021
What is the music??
Not even 5 minutes and toast already got the video demonetized
I'm early
Why is Yvonne always standing up?
These video ideas come from feverdreams and I enjoy them
Who else here is in medicine and is quickly trying to read their single lead EKG?
Michael’s face when lily hugs him lol
was this michaels idea?
more michael! yay! tasers!? our god has finally returned! we need to see michael control his heart rate, actually.
brodin tries to kill the entirety of offlinetv ™️
AYO WE EARLY
Waiting for the mafia video that yall gave a sneak peek for
OTV: were doing a vid MIchael not interested: NO OTV: theres tazers Michael: BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
POG
you know otv vids won't be normal/boring if micheal is in the thumbnail
What a blessing. 🙏🏻 ✨
Getting a new OfflineTV video on my birthday? Don't mind if I do! :D
What the hell is poki into???
I really really wish it was titled "Through the Tasers and Flames"
EARLY AND EXCITED
4 minsss
Last time I was this early, I thought trump won the election.
wow only took me 4 minutes to find the video
They knew what they were doing when they put Michael in the thumbnail and tasers in the title
Otv adult entertainment every Friday at 10 PM after OTV and Friends
This sounds like a disaster waiting to happen
Can I get a heart?         Thank you
Lily and Micheal kisses in the begining. It was so cute
Burnnn
I can tell this is Michael's favourite video yet.
⠀
4:04pm
lets go
E
Lily and Micheal always remind me of how lonely i am, sadge
Comments already talking about the end of the video like it didn't come out 2min sgo
6k views in a minute
This looks like Michael’s calling
2 minute gang
Pog!!
brodin slowly is becoming the best offlinetv member.  his ideas are everything
Couples on average have the same heart rate
Its michael's time to shine
This seems like their goal is to kill the other person to win... Brodin wtf!
whenever theres "a number of objects" in an otv video its always the most whack, disconnected shit that is still somehow cohesive
This doesn’t change the fact that there are 40 million penguins in the Southern Hemisphere, so realistically if all of the penguins of the Southern Hemisphere band together and surprise attack Swaziland after crossing South Africa, they could invade the country Swaziland with a 40-1 ratio, as there are only 1 million people living in Swaziland. Therefore, with a bit of planning, advanced  Logitechs, a few years of training and guerrilla tactics, if all the penguins in the Southern Hemisphere banded together to attack Swaziland they could defeat the nation and creat their own penguin empire, a terrifying though isn’t it.
Tasers = Michael
I wouldn't be disappointed if Brodin was made a full member of OTV
I'm early, but have no clever joke. Woops.
llama is an apple
Brodin’s goal is to kill and torture otv
Thanks for making these vids they are good for passing the time through all the travel I do
Noice
Brodin is trying to kill them
:DDD
Poggers
gotta love DaVinky entering the video

Its time for Michael to be the main character
More with Fedmyster please
