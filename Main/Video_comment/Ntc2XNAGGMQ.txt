WHAT A NARCISSISTIC SONG, BUT ADAM WOULDN'T EVEN REALIZE HOW NARCISSISTIC THIS SONG IS, COZ WHY WOULD A CHEATER KNOW?  YOUR WIFE WILL NEVER TRUST AND LOVE YOU FULLY AGAIN. YOU'LL ALWAYS HURT HER WITH YOUR PRESENCE, BUT SHE'S TRYNA BE STRONG FOR HER KIDS.   WHAT A BAD HUSBAND AND FATHER.
Please comment if you have some cool songs like this vibe, and/or sound. Its also reason to come back and see the song if i forget😢
Ragazzi in italiano Io proseguo fate una bella bellissima musica fate veramente del buon sound musica di qualche anno fa però chi ha piacere per poter vedere qualche anno fa che magari ha avuto qualche avuto qualche problemi ascolta se ascolta questa musica può dare una possibilità di poter migliorare però voi continuate a fare musica io vi amo a livello di musica d'accordo Io sono di ca' de Fabbri vi adoro come musica proprio di là non si può andare cioè

amazing song
Tu sei il migliore frontman del mondo Maroon five sei il migliore ultima canzone che hai fatto bellissima però non voglio dar leggere perché la canzone che hai fatto probabilmente è una situazione a livello di gruppo familiare d'accordo però questa qua è veramente bella saluto uomo tanta roba
Amazing ❤
Why this song hurting me.. What story behind this song.. 💔
This is beautiful. So raw, well done and my new favorite song. This screams truth in our current world. Thank you for this.
Adam LEVINE❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
l love the song and love so much his voice
Maroon 5... Enaaak nih di nikmati  bareng²... Sambil minum tèh   kopii Aku sukaaa..sapa lagi yg sukaa..     ❤❤❤
Love this i didnt know his voice could sound so clean and soary like
It's crazy that their most beautiful song in 23 years is a total commercial failure and has the least likes and views among their songs.
Why this song has so few likes. It’s a classic
Crazy how bands best songs are often the ones that are more likely to be overlooked
Sexiest man alive and the best band❤
Its to simple but its a nice song. The play backs need to be more open in respect to relate to the many.😊
😢If I hit the ground,
Ahora se dejó la cabeza de pichi como trump
Pure con huevos lo que le falta adam para responder a los comentarios de los chilenos te cagaste con chile no
Wonderful song
Wow first time I hear the song its the greatest hit❤
Miss my brother so much!!! I wish he would know how I feel and we can just find the middle ground!!!

Now we need lisa in Romantic COMEDY ACTION plsss ❤❤
I love his voice! ❤
É claro que era você, mas não estava tão claro isso para mim. Olhava para oceu da noite, perguntando oque Deus queria de mim. Se existia alguém feito para mim, se haveria alguém para amar e morrer, alguém para adora-lo, Tão tão perto de mim, sem ela, eu não teria forças para essa guerra, mas lembro de tua promessa de proteger a ela minha Daniela.

This song makes me travel back in time to Maroon's origin. I love the modern Maroon, but what I really fall in love with Maroon 5 is back
Adam and Maroon 5 have another classic on their catalogue!
This song is exactly what the world needs right now - a reminder to find common ground and choose hope over division. Beautifully written and performed, it's a message that resonates deeply.
LORD! This is the first time I see 2J singing together. What a beautiful gift
Love Middle Ground ❤❤
Love this song and their lyrics too
Sweet❤❤❤
Sometimes there is no middle ground to be found. You just have to move on and let it be once in awhile. Dont be so hard on yourself.
God I hope the new album has this sound.
Nice

FE de el gran JORGE GONZÁLEZ  po' compadre😡
Ver: FE de Jorge González..
PLAGIARISM? , Original song "Fé", Jorge González chilean singer : https://youtu.be/ofnpYNeZWMc?si=v6jmBpwJLSBkRKvb
Plagio de "fe, Jorge Gonzales"
escuchame una vez, todo tiene un final...
Quién más por la canción de Jorge González??
El coro es igual a la canción Fe de Jorge González de los prisioneros
Está canción es muy parecida a FE de Jorge Gonzáles de 1993 ...el coro es igual ..
Pero q plagio más grande, fe de Jorge González
it gives a perfect message for people who dont like to live. thank you maroom 5!
Social media is powerful... ur reaction to girl hugs you dude.. many people disappointed
Oh its nice
❤❤❤
This strongly applies to NOW!

🏛 Romans 8:11-14. And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus😇😇 from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ😇 from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you. 12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. 13 For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. 14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are sons of God. Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are these: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, revelry, and things like these; of the which I tell you before, just as I have also told you in time past, that they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Galatians 5:19-21
You amaze me. Keep on your journey.
You amaze me.

There’s a middle ground 💙💚
Ubelievable…….Adam Levine knocked out of the park with this one. Incredibly emotional track. Makes me want to check out the rest of this album…. This deserves a Grammy for sure
I  love song maroon 5
It sincerely blows my mind that when they were first starting out, playing in bars, they ended up playing to a crowd of zero because everyone hated them so much they got up and walked out..  And now, they are one of the biggest bands making amazing music!!  They are the underdog story that I will teach my kids as they grow up

Love these guys so much! I first heard them when I was 8-9 when I was learning to ice skate ⛸️ used to hear them all the time (Sugar, Animals, Payphone, and one more night mostly) and they just give me so much nostalgia. I’m 16 now and still listening and enjoying every story they tell in there music and connecting with it more as I get older.  Just saw them in concert a few days ago and they were tremendous, absolutely outstanding! Best and only concert I’ve ever been too! ❤❤❤

Am I crazy to think that we Could make it out? Am I crazier to believe There's a middle ground? I'm so up, I'm so down, I'm so broken I'm so tired I can't sleep I'm not mine, I'm not yours, I'm not sure of anything Oh, sisters and brothers are picking sides And both of our mothers are terrified And I'm crying out to an empty sky Tell me If I hit the ground And I fall down to my knees Would you hear the sound? Am I crazy to think that we Could make it out? Am I crazier to believe There's a middle ground? Middle ground, there's a middle ground I don't need someone to love I just need someone to live for Middle ground, there's a middle ground On my knees, where I belong Please tell me If I hit the ground And I fall down to my knees Would you hear the sound? Am I crazy to think that we Could ever make it out? Am I crazier to believe There's a middle ground? Middle ground, there's a middle ground (oh) Crazier to believe there's a middle ground Middle ground, there's a middle ground (oh) I need you to believe, oh, there's a middle ground

Chupilca del diablo: Según la tradición, la chupilca del diablo corresponde a una bebida, preparada a partir de la mezcla de aguardiente y pólvora negra, distribuida a los soldados chilenos durante la Guerra del Pacífico (1879-1884) y a la que se le atribuyeron poderes mágicos que hacían que el soldado entrara en un trance, alcanzando fuerzas sobrehumanas. Su nombre proviene de la similitud entre los ingredientes utilizados para la preparación de este brebaje y la chupilca, que es la mezcla de chicha y harina tostada.[1][2]
Ingredientes para hacer Pollo mañoso arvejado al maroon 5:  2 trozos de pollo  1 cebolla blanca  1 zanahoria  1 taza de arvejas  3 dientes de ajo  3 hojas de laurel  1 cucharadita de comino  1 pizca de pimienta  1 pizca de orégano  1 pizca de sal de Cáhuil  1 chorro de aceite vegetal  Pela el ajo y retira la vena o brote interior para bajar su sabor e intensidad, pica finamente y con la hoja del cuchillo aplasta hasta que obtengas una especie de pasta casera. Aliña el pollo con la pasta de ajo casera, sal de mar, comino y pimienta. Reserva. Incorpora el pollo y agrega agua o caldo de pollo si la preparación lo requiere (también puedes añadir vino blanco). Dejamos cocinar aproximadamente unos 20 minutos a temperatura media. Agrega la arveja, servir caliente

Que buena canción, voz única, de las mejores bands Rock Pop, que he escuchado, sigo su música desde "This Love", el tributo a Sinead O'cconor , con Nothing compares To You, en instagram fue hermosa, la dejé guardada para escucharlas en las noches, perfectamente podrían haber sido un éxito más de la banda, gran tema, gran acústico con 🎸, las adoro, no sé tocar 1 cuerda, pero me impresiona la majestuosidad de quien la sabe utilizar, me dejo encantar con sus sonidos, es increible éxito tras éxito.Saludos desde Chile 6️⃣🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🎸🎸🎸🎸🌹👈🖖👁️🎩👁️

Gracias a la vida  de Chile con amor? Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto Me dio dos luceros, que cuando los abro Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado Y en las multitudes la hombre que yo amo  Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario Con él las palabaras que pienso y declaro Madre, amigo, hermano y luz alumbrando La ruta del alma del que estoy amando  Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto Me ha dado el oído que en todo su ancho Graba noche y día, grillos y canarios Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado  Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos Playas y desiertos, montañas y llanos Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio  Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto Así yo distingo dicha de quebranto Los dos materiales que forman mi canto Y el canto de ustedes que es mi propio canto Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto  Fuente: Musixmatch  Compositores: Violeta Parra Sandoval

WHO IS ADAM LEVINE : OLD WINE IN A NEW BOTTLE...
This man is my childhood 🙏😭
❤
We love bboaiwu😅
Chile does not forget
Maroon 5 was one of the best band in the 2004/2014, after all not so much relevant but this song... This song is so so amazing!!! Is perfect poetry
is amazing the mix of feelings i´m a big fan of yours work greetings from HABANA CUBA
Not this song, but in general, I think Adam Levine reminds me a little bit of Mick Jagger, his dance around style and his style of performing not exactly, of course cause makes a little really crazy, but Adam has that same characteristic
Good song, barely any autotune can't notice. Your recent other songs are a bit too autotune for me, wasted talent tbh
I AM A HUGE FAN
Per te papà 😢❤
❤❤❤❤
They're good u have to admit it
Can't wait for your next album 😊
Anyone else see a definite relationship to a praise song? Was it intentional? I'm not mad. I freakin' Love this song!!❤

Hi Adam...I really love your song daylight. Could you make more songs that sound like that? Same mellow vibe.
Love this song😭💓
Jan 22, 2024. To Mr. Levine. On the (American Idol) show, how come you guys never let the Metal World show they're stuff! I insist the show have Aggressive bands! This band is from Spain. Make the show (International Idol!!) >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdpjmZmAtI0

I've always kinda liked Maroon 5 but then they release this and yep they're brilliant.
I heard this song for the first time on a plane from Europe. I was like who is this amazing singer? Had no idea it was Adam Levine! I normally am whatever about maroon 5, but this song truly touched my heart ❤❤ it makes me cry!
This video is one of the best,since I started being a fan.i mean the way it was taken and my combination with the household chores,greatness.
❤
My humble #tribute of this great #masterpiece ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul_KcwwTTEA
wonderful sound, a song that goes deep in the strings of the soul
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ all of their songs are always hit its crazy but believable ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Maroon 5 is and will forever live with me, Im a huge fan of Elvis Presley, Paramore, Avril Lavigne, MJ, Queen, Justin bieber young version and Ava Maxx, guns n roses, beatles, Bruno Mars, and other rock band like Coldplay and many more but Maroon 5 is in my opinion is a legendary band, yes they are not in a controversial era like the beatles, elvis, mj and queen but they sure made consistent hits and never disappoint me, they actually always blow my mind on how all of their songs are so good in my ears, catchy to my liking. Always in my heart.
"It doesn't matter how long this song has been around, it will remain iconic forever!"  I compiled a video of many hot songs of this favorite singer. We invite you to come listen and enjoy

Chica Rica  René de la Vega.  Mi chica, te mueves, sensual y sonrojada  No sabes si mirar, pero quieres taquillar. Luces bikinis y minis de colores Soñando con mil coches y chicos para ir a bailar.  (chicos para ir a bailar)  Vas, chica rica,  viendo si algo enganchas, viendo si algo hechizas Vas, chica rica, Tienta tu figura, tienta tu sonrisa  Y matas, matas, matas, matas  Piensa la gente que eres algo loca Que estás fuera de foco, que sólo eres moda. Pero tú ganas, eres la única guerra Que nos gusta a los hombres Si nos quieren matar por amor. (si nos quieren matar por amor)  Vas, chica rica, viendo si algo enganchas, viendo si algo hechizas Vas, chica rica, Tienta tu figura, tienta tu sonrisa Y matas, matas, matas, matas  Vas, chica rica, viendo si algo enganchas, viendo si algo hechizas Vas, chica rica, Tienta tu figura, tienta tu sonrisa
Wow! what a range this guy has. This sounds like a man reaching up to God - Jesus awaits brother 🙏

RECETA EMPANADA DE PINO INGREDIENTES Relleno: 4 cebollas 1/2 kilo de posta de vacuno 2 huevos duros 40 gramos de pasas rubias 8 aceitunas 40 gramos de manteca 20 gramos de harina Ají de color Azúcar granulada Orégano Comino Merquén Sal Masa: 600 gramos de harina Salmuera 60 gramos de manteca 1 huevo INSTRUCCIONES Pino: Corte la carne en cubos pequeños (parmentier). Coloque una olla a fuego y agregue la manteca y fría la cebolla picada en cubos pequeños (parmentier). Agregue la sal y azúcar, y fría hasta que la cebolla quede transparente. Luego añada la carne y siga friendo durante pocos minutos para que la carne no quede sobre cocida, ya que falta hornear. Agregue los condimentos y rectifique sabor. Luego la harina y agua fría para unir (ligar) y dar mejor consistencia y jugosidad al pino. Apague y enfrie el pino. Se sugiere realizarlo de un día para otro. Hidrate las pasas en agua. Masa: Coloque la harina cernida en un bol, agregue la manteca derretida tibia y la salmuera caliente. Trabaje y forme una masa lisa y homogénea, debe trabajar hasta desarrollar el gluten (sobar) por lo menos 10 minutos. Una vez lista tape la masa y deje reposar por 10 minutos. En una mesa usleree la mitad de la masa hasta obtener un grosor de 5 milímetros y corte los discos de 22 centímetros de diámetro, reserve. Realice el mismo procedimiento con el resto de masa. Armado: Coloque todos los discos separados sobre una mesa, distribuya el pino en cada masa hasta acabarlo. Parta el huevo a la mitad y colóquelo sobre el pino junto con las pasas escurridas del agua y las aceitunas. Doble las masas y cierre de la forma deseada. Pinte las masas con yema de huevo diluida con gotas de leche o agua (dora). Llévelas a una lata o placa de horno espolvoreada con un velo de harina y hornee a 180°C durante 20 minutos aproximadamente, o hasta que estén cocidas y doradas encima. Retírelas del horno y sírvalas caliente. Glosario: Desarrollar gluten es la capacidad de elasticidad de una masa que se logra después de un continuo trabajo de la masa (tipo chicle).

Wow, just wow!!!
I wrote a song called middle ground, I was separated from my spouse. He died unexcped, Our daughter didn't get to say goodbye! I picked up the slack! I come from a commercial music family in I underwrite.
My heart goes to his wife. I can't fathom how she managed to forgive a husband who's been inside other women while married.
So hit perfect

Tôi đã khóc khi nghe bài hát này, tôi đã thất nghiệp được 6 tháng, khi đó tài chính không còn, vợ và mẹ phải nuôi tôi, dù cố gắng xin việc nhưng vẫn không mấy tốt hơn, lúc đầu còn tự chấn an mình rằng mọi chuyện sẽ ổn, nhưng giờ tôi như vô định, cố gắng vùng vẫy để không làm gánh nặng cho gia đình, trước mặt họ tôi luôn cố gắng bình thường, vui vẻ, hoạt bát, nhưng ban ngày khi chỉ còn mỗi mình trước máy tính, tui bơ vơ, không biết phải làm gì hơn, cứ tìm việc, ứng tuyển, đăng tin bán hàng, chờ đợi. Tự dưng nay tôi muốn nghe nhạc, lên đây thấy Middle Ground, từng lời như nói hộ tôi về tâm tư, khổ sở mà mình đang trải qua. Thank you Maroon 5, this is a good song and it's touch my heart.
Yup this is a song for the soul... love this!! Calms my soul.. hope it does for others too. ❤
The peefect song
เพลงนี้เพราะมากกก น่าฟังต่อจาก memories แต่เหมือนไม่ค่อยปัง

This man's voice

I just found my 2023 favorite track. It's been a minute since I found a song that touches the soul. Thank you Maroon 5
Perfect timing thank you Jesus ❤🙌
I love this Maroon fiv IS thé best singer this last 3years
Hello, dear friends, I have been giving you career 24,,,23 videos for a few days, but you are not helping me.😞
Beautiful video.  Beautiful  song.
We are all getting older😓
Longing to be with someone, this song speaking with my current situation and great song. 😂
Cc marron 5 est mon groupe de musique préféré 🤩 je les adore 💞la voix du chanteur Adam Levine me transporte de joie 💞

I don't know why it's so easy for me to sing and listen to your songs
https://youtu.be/PGOF_FSR__g?si=6Si7NLXxgv0aERtC
This one touches me in a place I just can't explain.
Beautifully written and performed
Excelente melodía. Gran madurez de grupo...........
I love this song.😮
When I first heard this song I wasn't sure about it, but its really grown on me. It's so nice to see Adam and the boys go back to their roots and make a song that doesn't rely on corny rap artists and 10+ songwriters, just the boys and their guitars. I have a really good feeling about their next album if it has more songs like this on it!
Discontent from their Title
🌟🌞 que hermoso suena 🌝
I love this song very beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤
He's still have that beautiful voice.. Maroon 5 is never failed to made our ear feels comfort.
Oh my god this song is so good !!!! I hear it whenever I start drawing
I believe the middle ground is in a gray area. Polar extremes seem destined to melt.❤
Ugly
Upon hearing the song, it reminds me of my childhood years when I was leaving with my grandparents in the province away from my parents and also my 3 siblings. It was quite lonely and sad, however my grandparents really took good care of me. I was raised with humility and kindness. Learned the value of self respect among others, and my lolo would always taught me that life isn't easy but I have to be prepared and will always adjust on any circumstances that may arise or take. I have to be ready for any challenges and responsibilities that I will encounter. I should be strong enough to face them, from any trials I will succeed.  Life may have so many mysteries to encounter. And yet, I should overcome all of these...i will be strong, I may suffer but I will succeed. There is somebody out there that will always keep me safe...The Almighty Father in Heaven!🙏❤️🤗👍
I’m not mine I’m not yours
One of my faves♥️
Nobody looking realy behind this Song!!!  Nobody can Say....  I Love this Song!!!  This Song have many   Pain and Hurts!!!  HÄÄÄÄ  ALL YOU LOVE AND LIKE????  PAIN AND HURTS???  AND NOW FOR YOUR  THINKING MINDE!!!  IS THE WORLD GO SO!!!
J'aime beaucoup.  Superbe chanson
I miss my kids so much. I thought it was my kids and Riley and Ethan. Yet it's me and Kim then our parents. Does the generations ever see it's the kids that hurt? Even the child inside the man/woman and every other gender. It don't matter. Love is all that matters!!!!!
WHERE IS HIS HAIR?
Trop mimi avec ses enfants et sa femme ❤❤❤
every song that this band made is all HIT!
If my generation and the older generation can't get along, how are we suppose to fix the younger generation? Like I'm here in the middle begging for peace before I go home but I don't see nobody on either side taking me by the hand and saying...okay let's do this! Let's bring more peace to Newfoundland.
Merci pour ce revirement de style:tout en vulnérabilité,humanité,fraternité. Dans ce titre,vous laissez enfin parler le "cœur " + que le "corps". Il était temps!❤😊
新しい時代の幕開け「伝説が始まる」史上最高の歌です❤❤😊😊
After 20yrs finally best song ever from maroon 5
How is this not multi platinum????
this song is so Harry Styles coded

The Champions are helping me so much even if it is painful. I'm going to miss all these people. Living together we grow bonds, well I did. Thanks for the hard lessons. I do believe family is everything. That's why it hurts so much. I love all my family. Even on the bad days when they hurt me and I say I hate them. It was just easier to run away from it all and distract myself but deep down I truly do love all my family. Just waiting for them to come around and love me back.
and again.. you didn't fail Us m5
Maroon 5 used to pretend they were a punk band, than a rock band, now an R&B group while all along they have always been just a really shitty mainstream pop band for the masses of illiterate sheep
❤❤❤
Los amo. Love forever  número uno en mi cora ❤ number one in my heart ❤  #Cuernavaca
I don’t feel like people are looking into this enough… I feel like he’s signing to his wife because of him CHEATING! it’s a beautiful, beautiful song and they always do amazing with songs like these but this is definitely a song to or for his wife…
Ya😢
maroon adam ruined my life. i wanted to meet him once, he was getting out of his car to get to the red carpet and i asked for an autograph, and he made the most disgusted face and put both of his hands on my chest and pushed me away from him (i was a few feet away so it was weird that he lunged at me to push me further away). i fell onto the ground and i scraped up my hands and cheek pretty badly. he had already gone before i got up. seriously the worst celebrity interaction ive ever had!

Apapun genrenya maroon 5 pilihannya
good music video but maroon's voice is not the same like it was back in the past when he released what lovers do and she will be loved now maroon changed he is 44 years old now and he has no hair and now he is all alone with no one to support him I remember when maroon released his album and he released V and songs all about Jane 20 years ago maroon made a lot of songs and have his fans and liking his music and have a smile on his face now he is so bad and no where else to go now maroon can not come to the trip with us because he is not feeling well he is old now maroon is almost in his fifty's but now maroon is part of the fam but maroon thanks for releasing this song and this song will change your life man
I have listened to this song atleast 30 times on loop since yesterday❤❤

When is ur next album
There,s no midddle ground for me💔😭💔😭💔😭💔💔😭💔😭 the guy that i love Jorik already has a girl friend 😭💔😭💔😭💔i am heartbroken and so sad. No one can lift me up this song reminds me of what we had.  💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭 i love him too mutch to keep him so i let him go. This song has the words that i was looking for wen i had to discribe what we had. It lasted 8 beautifull mounths the most beautifull mounts in all my life. But i wasn,t what he need. I cry and i sing to this song in my car at home and wen i sing i see flashbacks of me and Jorik flashing  for my eyes and of our beautifull but short time together. 💔😭💔😭💔💔😭💔💔😭💔😭💔😭💔i will never find a love like Jorik ever again. I still love him whit all my heart💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭 i am not happy anymore i am sad,heartbroken and lost😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔 no one can sheer me up,no one can make me feel like he has done and he still does😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔 he is and always will be the first and last love of my life 💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭 i am letting no one see that i am cryin i only show that i am sad. He wisperd to me wen we were working together :you will always have the part of me that i will never show anyone and we laughed together allot. You know the real me.We lauged so hard i could have die but its better than burst in to tears in front of him. 😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔 If i hear this song at work i burst into tears. I hope it doesnt come on the radio cause i can,t handle that😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔💔💔💔cry in my car and at home every time i hear this song and think of our time together. I have next week 3 weeks of vacation so i don,t see Jorik for 3 weeks. I go on alone sad,heartbroken and whit no one to save me😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔 Jorik you have my heart for now and ever😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭 i so up i am so down i am so broken i can,t even sleep. I am on my knees were i belong💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔i don,t sing or dance at work not anymore. 💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭. Jorik and me get along well at work even tho i am sad i,ll be strong for him. Everyone else can see my sad face but not Jorik. For him i smile. I will always love him no matter what happens💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔 we have an unbreakble and speciale bound no one understands💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭 all i want is for Jorik to be happy cause he wasnt realy happy wen he was me cause he couldnt show me all of him💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭 and if he,s happy whitout me so be it. For him i will do anything 💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔he thanked me for letting him go😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔only love can change a person and i changed for Jorik. It wasnt easy but i am glad that he pushed me to that mentale state of mind. I did it and the bound we now have is worth is. I feel so blessed and so lucky now💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭 i believe we saved eatch other😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔 altho my heart is broken for now and ever. I miss him and i love him for all of my life. But i have learnt that i can,t be selfish. Cause thats what i was selfish. Jorik thought me how to love and for that i am forever greatfull💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭 Jorik brought me peace and quit but he couldnt love me. Its give and take and i was so selfish 😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😢 i have,peace i have,hope i have guidence. I don,t need someone to love. I just need someone to live for.Thanks to Jorik i have that😭💔😭💔😭💔😭everyone else at work can,t understand why i am quit all of a sudden. They think i am sad but i am not i found peace and quit💔😭💔😭💔😭💔whit tears and a broken heart😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭i don,t think that Jorik is coming back to me but i love him whit all my heart and i will do forever no love is like he,s love. Why? Why are males so upsessed whit the next and next and the next girlfriend 😭💔😭💔😭💔😭😭💔😭💔😭💔💔💔😭💔am i not good enough 😭💔💔😭💔😭💔😭😭💔i don,t want anyone else i want Jorik 💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭💔😭

what happened to all the creepy texts he sent?
Maroon 5 never gets old, Adam never stops surprising. I've been hearing them from more than 15 years and they're one of the best bands in the world because of the ability to adapt to the changing music of the decades.
Behati has got to be the most beautiful and adorable wife a man could have.  No wonder their daughters are so precious.  It's amazing that the group is still making music I can't stop playing.  They are one of the most original sounding bands performing today, and I love the emotion Adam clearly puts into his singing on this one.  YAY Maroon 5!

I like Cohen's style. But I can listen to him too many times in a day. Don't know anything else about him. The others that are on his channel are also pretty good.
Amazing Maroon 5! I listened to your songs since I was in 5th grade. I am now 21 and I'm still lovin it! ❤

Too bad this song flopped 😢
This song just speaks to my light. I needed this. Thank you M5!
Where do I begin ?. Firstly, Adam Levine defines the meaning of an Artist. His band MAROON 5 & he have been cohesive for YEARS. That speaks volumes. Adam is instantly recognizable & I LOVED this song from the intro. Then comes the VIDEO featuring his beautiful family. Thank you Adam & MAROON 5 for an overall beautiful piece of work 💖 P.S. Their BEST work to date imho 😘
Love it!
Nice Song
...
I love this song so much.
i am not an autotune hater, but Adam please shut it off (he is really using it too much in Jordi). You had goddamn beautiful voice in the 2000-2010s era, you really don't need them to refine your voice

don't shout
I come back every day to watch this at least once.  Some days, things feel so bleak. Every day feels like Groundhog Day. I miss my Father. I work so hard, but don't ever get ahead. I've got friends & acquaintances all over, but everyone's lives are so spread out. No one seems to have time to sit and talk, sit and laugh, sit and reminisce... And when we do speak of simpler times, the truth of these days hits us all, and affects us.  Then we part ways, and keep living life like robots.  This song resonates in my soul. Maroon 5 takes me back, Adam's voice and his band's backup vocals and instrumentals in this song give the best vibes.  There's so much hatred & arguing. Politics. Religion. Differences in belief and lifestyle.   The lyrics are so true. Everyone picking sides, our mothers growing older and wondering what kind of world we will all be left behind to live in ... As a Mother, I feel that.  Governments falling apart, war, famine, the list goes on.   Can't we all just find a Middle Ground?  My Daily prayer is for Peace. I hope someone out there in the Universe hears me.
let me guess, this is his "family man" tribute to himself
At least Mr Sexy hasn’t tattooed “the face”

Hay quá
Rất thích thương hiệu này ❤❤
Honestly, love this song so much.. Adam bleaching his hair and wearing ripped up pink sweaters makes me want to hate this a lot. I've been and M5 fan since Kara's Flowers. This makes me not like them so much. Damage control should make you more humble.  Not bleaching hair....maybe Hands All Over Adam would be good.

I wasn't prepared to cry to a Maroon 5 song...heard this on the radio today and was like wait what? Promptly sent it to multiple people I care about with a "Have you heard the new song??" memo and listened to it multiple times. Wow. I've never heard them put out something like this. It's deep. Totally resonates with my mood in life right now!
Thinking its what I need right now but my love does not even want to discuss!!!

Please remaster back to the old 2000's songs and upscale them with AI in 4K, improve the frame rate to go smoother between 24 and 25 with AI as well, and have the better audio quality to boost the bass and treble and normalize the volume between low and high without noise for clean and crisp bitrate after this song!
finally I found the best song of 2023....did I .....🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

Wow.  He's got a little bit of an indie sound on this.  He sounds better than ever; I'm ready for this new ride they're gonna take us on!
Beautiful and sad song with a simple videoclip full of emotions. Maroon 5 is back, it's good for us...
This is the best thing from them in almost 10 years. I mean I would love for them to write their own songs again, and it's not their best song ever, but it's a lovely song and they sound like a band again. The music video is low-key and just feels real. And the live version they did on The Voice was great. If this is the start of a new era for them, I think I'm ready to come back to the world of Maroon 5!

That someone to live for over all is God, and recognizing that His son is our only Lord and Savior brings us everything we need, so when we decide to hit the middle ground, everything comes easy, love, peace, health, life and family! That's our middle ground after being down inside a hole or feeling like we can't ever fall from the "heights" we once thought had everything for us.
Man look at my guy PJ Morton. So chill on the keys and back vocals for Maroon 5 like he ain’t a beast when he does his own projects.
Honestly only listened a few times and have a feeling Im going to really enjoy this song
I can not stop playing this song-it resonates on so many levels-so far I can not make it through it without sobbing. IMO-the tears are the blessing of release, but it’s those days that they feel like they just won’t stop that things feel much more cloudy.
Yes!!! ♒
I understand. 🎶🎵🎼
Adam acting like he's a great husband and father lmao I can't believe his wife stayed with him (& did this video) after numerous insta hoes came fwd with proof he's a dirty cheater. Yuck 🤮 this is disturbing.

Adam Levine wearing PINK SWEATER T-SHIRT with hole his looks like a Beggar
❤ He has seen U on your knees … No, the sky is not empty and he’ll come through …. Psalm 91 and psalm 13  Are appropriate as a divine message. Apologies  for the suffering he is working on your behalf 🙏👌☝️🙌💜
Never been a fan of the band but this song does it for me 👍🏻
This song is the story of my last year of life.  I cried the first time I heard it.  Thanks Adam for the depth and emotions of this song. ❤

When I listen to this song I feel goosebumps all over.  I'm your FC from Thailand. I always love your music "Maroon 5"
35th and Archer you ain't going do shit! I'm backing N E body up. Merch! God bless
i mean...it's not as offensively terrible as the last two albums, but it's still pretty boring and nowhere near anything on their first two albums
So i see M5 is slowly joining 1R music range. Getting slow, soulful  but are forever my favorite  <3
Im so happy they are back ❤❤😊
Oh Dear F... God. Another awesome better number 1 song....
Not only did Maroon5 meet in this house to create this fantastic song, but also the professor to plan one of the best bank robberies 😂
Even though I'm a huge fan of Maroon 5, i have to say this song is pretty meh, i hope one day that they go back to the style of the first two albums.
This is beautiful ❤️
Love it ❤
wow....beautiful, touching song. love the video....God Bless

Hope you recommend my videos to people who are interested in Chinese. It’s not easy to make so many high-quality videos of teaching Chinese. Chinese characters still retain their pictographic origins. Knowing what the characters look like originally can help understand the meanings and remember them vividly.  I’ve spent about 100,000 hours studying English humor and Western culture, and many years studying Chinese culture and jokes. My native language is Chinese.

I am a Cuban. Unfortunately, brothers and sisters are picking sides here and it is quite sad, I hope everybody finds a middle ground.
christian hillsong vibe isnt it? 💗
Stop the war. Stop the hate. Earth is too big for us not to share. Life is too beautiful for us to waste.
The soul in his voice here just moves me <3

I'm so up, I'm so down, I'm so broken I'm so tired I can't sleep I'm not mine, I'm not yours I'm not sure of anything  Oh, sisters and brothers are picking sides And both of our mothers are terrified And I'm crying out to an empty sky Tell me  If I hit the ground And I fall down to my knees Would you hear the sound? Am I crazy to think that we Could make it out? Am I crazier to believe There's a middle ground?  Middle ground, there's a middle ground I don't need someone to love I just need someone to live for Middle ground, there's a middle ground On my knees, where I belong Please tell me  If I hit the ground And I fall down to my knees Would you hear the sound? Am I crazy to think that we Could make it out? Am I crazier to believe There's a middle ground?  Middle ground, there's a middle ground (oh) Crazier to believe there's a middle ground Middle ground, there's a middle ground (oh) I need you to believe, oh, there's a middle ground
Como una canción me puede llegar tanto! Gracias y que hermosa canción!

Cool song 🎧 cool video
Life makes sense when you live it with a purpose 💙💙💙
Beautiful people ❤where are you listening from ?
PLEASE, stop use rising sun flag on your videos. please.  ​  rising sun flag is symbol of brutal imperialism to asians. it originally just meaning "safe return from a fishing", became "a full load(of fish)" and "success". before Japanese imperial armed forces use it as their flags.   ​  you know what? Nazi flag's too. it was symbol of "safe return from a travel" that called Swastika, became a "success what you doing" and "prosperity". doesn't meaning any violence nor conquer before Nazi use it as their flag.   ​  German has excute Nazi and aware they were at fault so they do not use Swastika by any means. But Japan hasn't.   ​  so please.... please stop using that symbol please. Japan has national flag that just has red dot on white background so please use them to express Japan. please.
Fascinating 😎😎
Es increible que esta cancion logra ponerme a llorar de felicidad 🥹, una mezcla de emociones que me encanta sentir 🥴💖

This reminds me about Songs about Jane era and I absolutely love this for Maroon 5!❤
I’m in looveeee for reaaaaal !!!
💜💜💜💜🔥🔥🔥
Tell me if I hit the ground.. powerful,,,,he has always been one of my favorites and so has the group.. I’m 42 and this song made me cry but smile.. his voice gives me goose bumps not too many artist anymore havde that gift when they sing with their soul it’s a big diffference.. and yes their audience can tell .. wonderful song indeed..

I need a purpose 😢
Why is Adam starting to look like Pep guardiola!?
This is just good. Great.
It's nice to see Adam and co. doing a real song again. It's been awhile.

İ missed old ones when THEY were a rock brand
Wonderful song... Maroon5 is back with a bang! And you Adam Levine, Man your voice is just awesome.
Estimated, I simply must admit that I really really never have cried to any song except to Spandau Ballet song "Through the barricades" because each time I play it I remember my late  father, but that is completely another story. And here I go again not on my own but I have a tendency to write quite a lot. Many sentences when the thing that I want to point out can fit in one sentence. Ergo..I cannot believe that Maroon 5 performance and especially Mr.Adam Levine, and I must stress this...almost, almost made me cry. I had had tears in my eyes but not rolling tears down my face. I do not understand my reaction to this song because I rarely ever cry. And now this. Mr.Levine and I know that you can for us seniors in our 40s and for younger generation, especially ZED generation compose something more cheerfull although the song is amazing.
goood
https://youtu.be/MlxPO94_D_g...Earthquakes Middle Ground.
Great song. I really hope they have a couple more songs off their next album with this acoustic feel. Really showcases Adams voice and the bands talents/instruments clearly. Excited for the next single. Been a fan since the start. 😊
So beautiful ❤

I love this song and a video, great to see Maroon 5 again on their style.

I was , I'm and I'll always a fan of maroon 5 music 🎼❤🔥🔥
there's no middle ground on cheating, adam lol
It's not just a song, but a sleep inducer. The vibe rests my hope, peace, belief, and thoughts with you, Adam Levine!
❤❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰🥰
we all f**ck up in are life but are f**ck ups are builders in life
I dont know man, the love songs and happy family image just dont hit the same after being exposed for not only cheating on his wife (yes the one thats all on these videos) but hes also plotting and having babies with randoms.
Oh Adam 🔥💪 Twój głos rozkłada na łopatki 🙈🥰🤩🤗

THEY ARE BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACKKK
Emezie Okorafor, Ma And My Family, Love Adam Levine, And We Are Listen, And Watch Anything Music Video, With Him, And His Band
Adam, loving people definitely doesn't come naturally to us. Love is something supernatural and comes from God. His greatest proof of love is Jesus. If we close our minds to believe in God and in his son, we lose the opportunity to receive that unique love that fills everything and that multiplies towards our environment.
Jesús dijo yo soy el camino la verdad y la vida. Despojémosnos de nuestros prejuicios y vayamos a El. ♥️
Peacefully
I love the every songs of you . Damn! You are always best <3
Maroon5 has been knocking it out of the park, since "Songs About Jane". Always premium stuff, always soulful. Rock on, guys!
Not really a fan of Maroon 5, but this songs touches a cord in me that I can't explain.  Seeing his wife an kids were chefs kiss.  Man I cried.
Adam Levine just kicked in the door to remind us he can sing singgggg. Love to see this. Saw Maroon 5 live as a teenager and it was an amazing experience. So talented
I love they are speaking thru this song for all mankind at this moment...💪🙏🙌
Oh I love this new song and video maroon 5
His voice changing a bit. His sharp tune is fading. It's nice, cuz a normal person can sing his song now. 😁😁
Langsung merinding😮❤❤
If I'm being honest this song isn't bad, but I just find it odd that it's a Maroon 5 song
I feel emotional 😭 I love them song
Country rock style? 🤔
Love it!
Beautiful.  Just wow. ❤
There always seems to be a song that finds a niche between others. This is one of them . I enjoyed the acoustics in my first time hearing 'Middle Ground'-Maroon 5.
This is a sad song
Wow😮
I saw this on the Voice last night. What a great song.
Perfect as always! ♥️ and Be and the girls: so cute 🥹♥️
I really like the new single Middle Ground by Maroon 5 and I can't wait until #8Album is out to buy!
Todavía pienso, por que Adam está Calvo v: no le queda
Wow

Beautiful song , lyrics , music , Adam voice is Amazing 🙏💜☯️☮️

Es un buen regreso la verdad toda la música que saca Maroon 5 me encanta y y está canción no es la excepción
“it is truly unreal how f****** hot you are, like it blows my mind”   “you are 50 times hotter in person… and so am I”.
its mean perfect song
Adam is not my favorite person in the world because he is arrogant and conceited, he did not make a good song as a band for a long time, since for a long time he fell into commercial pop, just to sell... but now after many years he has released one good song, we have to support it
Nice new elevator music.
Βeautiful song
What an AMAZING song!!! Thanks for this gift! ❤️❤️❤️
Maroon 5❤
So beautiful, powerfull. Thank you so much for this emotional song.

glad to see maroon 5 back so glad to hear from adam again and with such a powerful song
Finally released new song my idol

Am I the only one that hears both a pre-breakup anthem and anti-war plea?
Could not hear the words on this song when it was on the voice. Just listened and love it . Thank you the words are very important. ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
pai amado no que se transformou essa banda
Pode falar o que quiser, mas o maroon 5 sempre terá um lugar no meu coração ❤

Maroon 5 legend
Gostei! Música linda
.
Damn, a REAL song by Maroon    5? After all these years? Daaaaaaaamn
Beatiful music l loved ♥️☺️
Dont love this one... The video is adorable of course, but we all know is "marketing" "commercial" to put the family and saw to the World how is in love for his wife.....  " Lost" was better
«I’m not mine, I’m not yours  I’m not sure of anything » I just hope things will get better, bad days will be better again.
We need more “she will be loved “ type of songs 🥰😁😉

我愛❤❤❤的魔5
Beautiful! An beautiful song <3
They fell off.... Song sucks ass 👎
Finally ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is the first time in years i see them working/being together again with all the instrumentals and putting out something so touching❤ also, the bubbles at the end made me tear up, it shows the peace and love children bring and it goes so well with the song...  this all sounds like a genuine production they made, not just for the views and streams and i'm so here for it❤❤
Beautiful song and different versions of M5, the fact that in the end of the day people just want to be happy
Ең күшті топтардың бірі. Әндер үшін рақмет!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💙💛

Congrats Maroon 5
Que coisa mais linda ❤ eles sempre arrasam 🙏
BEAUTIFUL ❤❤❤
Welcome back to music Adam Levine 👍
❤
Love it❤
I don't know if anybody wants to hear this but I'll say it to everyone reading.. Don't stop grinding and hustling until you feel fulfilled, it's not all about been on top, the highest thing is just to feel fulfilled as you. Love yourselves and believe in yourselves because that's what will fuel your energy each time you feel like giving up. I don't have so many subscribers but the ones I have are so special to my struggle so far. I'm grateful they believe in me, they're the reason i will keep putting in my best ♥️♥️♥️
Nice song. Me encanta ❤
Love the song ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥😘🤩
Bagus
When i see this song first time i was just amazed
Love maroon 5 and love the song
This songZ in my heart 💜 Can RelateZ  Beautiful 🫶🏼💫🎶💕💯🚌
Sam Farrar not on the vid? My guy you should show yourself a bit. I thought Maroon 5 was back to 6 members..   And yes, Maroon 5 is 8!
I miss Ryan Dusick 😔 He will always have a special place in Maroon 5 :')
Argghhhhh, so good 🥹 I'm having Daylight flashbacks with that inspiring, beautiful vibe that Maroon 5 gives us...
Que hermosa letra!!! ❤
No puedo volver a ver a Adam Levine de la misma forma después de ver varios videos de como se comporta con la gente y sus fans
Damn I dnt need someone to love I need someone to live for wow
From Songs about Mary Jane to Middle ground... Maroon 5 always bring the touch in particular time of our life. I don't have kids, but I can play this Masterpiece into my private school in Cameroon. Again thank you for creating unique soul song like this. Relive childhood.
Finally 🎉
Sekian kalinya... Ini bagus
In the past year I've lost my best friend to cancer. My dog passed away as well. Then to make it worse my youngest was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma (bone cancer) in Oct. This song hit my heart.
😍😍🤩🤩💋💋💋💋🎶🎶🎶🎶🎸💓💓💖💖💫✨✨✨✨
What a creation!!! wow!!! And that singing is deeply touching!!!

my fav band
every Maroon 5 songs are better along the time
Someone please tell me what this song is about
My men 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Adam Levine, your vocals are breathtaking. I can feel your heart and mind in these vocals. You and Maroon 5 are truly gifted beyond measure. God gave you that voice for a special purpose and I thank you so much for sharing it with the world! I pray you will sing more songs just like this! God bless you and your family always!!
Beautiful song!  Awesome vocals Adam Levine, GREAT job the entire band.  Welcome back Maroon 5💖💖💖
Clearly this song is a cry for Jesus. Who else could possibly answer this but the One True God? Look for the Lord and you will find Him and fulfillment for your heart.
What a good comeback
Tôi rất thích thương hiệu này ❤❤
Now I can hear something good❤
Sucesso  👏👏👏❤❤❤
Absolute masterpiece. Nothing more to say.
this is so funy to me that he needs a middle ground. adam. you didn't need a middle ground when you were sexting MULTIPLE grounds...........
ddi he write the song with the women in his DM's? they all collaborated with him with the lyrics
oh the damage control lmao.
素晴らしいです!
Beautiful
Jesus offers peace, hope, life, light, guidance, all the things this world can’t offer but searches for! If you relate to the words of this song, cry out to God, he’s real and loves you! Praying hearts are opened to him when they realize that without God life lacks purpose! ❤
SO BEAUTIFUL! Love this vibe 💟
Oh, the Maroon 5 that has been gone for years now BACK... Love it ❤
Fact: We all can agree, Maroon 5's songs brighten everyone's day!

Love you Maroon❤
What a beautiful song. ❤️ The lyrics, the melody, the way Adam sang it, ang gandaaa 🥹❤️ what makes it more beautiful and more special ay yung ramdam ni Adam yung kinakanta nya kaya naparamdam nya rin sa listeners yung purpose/meaning ng kanta.  And yung 2:45 🥹❤️❤️

Is this song a redemption to wards his wife and family for why he did ?? Don’t get me wrong I love the song, but the words and meaning brings me back to what he’s experiencing with his infidelity .

Beautiful lyrics ❤  [Verse 1] I need peace, I need hope, I need guidance I need more than myself I need light, I need life, I need what I never felt  [Pre-Chorus] Sisters and brothers are picking sides And both of our mothers are terrified And I'm crying out to an empty sky Tell me  [Chorus] If I hit the ground And I fall down to my knees Would you hear the sound? Am I crazy to think that we Could make it out? Am I crazier to believe There's a middle ground?  [Verse 2] I'm so up, I'm so down, I'm so broken I'm so tired I can't sleep I'm not mine, I'm not yours, I'm not sure of anything  [Pre-Chorus] Oh, sisters and brothers are picking sides And both of our mothers arе terrified And I'm crying out to an empty sky Tеll me  [Chorus] If I hit the ground And I fall down to my knees Would you hear the sound? Am I crazy to think that we Could make it out? Am I crazier to believe There's a middle ground?  [Bridge] Middle ground, there's a middle ground I don't need someone to love I just need someone to live for Middle ground, there's a middle ground On my knees where I belong Please tell me  [Chorus] If I hit the ground And I fall down to my knees Would you hear the sound? Am I crazy to think that we Could ever make it out? Am I crazier to believe There's a middle ground? [Outro] Middle ground, there's a middle ground (Oh) Crazier to believe there's a middle ground Middle ground, there's a middle ground (Oh) I need you to believe, oh, there's a middle ground
I love it, it makes me feel a little sad but also joyful.
Now give us a whole album in this style
Love you

When ther world wants me to conform to the set patterns of life, Maroon 5 brings the scent of true ROMANTICISM to me.  They take me places I have never been to, beauty I've never touched & to fragrances I'm yet to dissolve into, with every song having its own fresh vibe. I can't thank you guys enough. Love.
Thank you Maroon 5 for new Music🤗🥰❤️💖😉👍

Adam inspired me to go all in with my music. He was once just like me, an artist trying to get heard. And now he’s on on top. It’s happening for me, and Im not stopping when it does! 🧡

Maroon 5 is back!!!!!! This song is soo perfect❤❤❤❤❤
I find this song somewhat decent and indecent for being too safe and not taking enough risks. Ultimately, opinions on the song will vary from person to person based on personal preference and musical taste, but I still liked it not that much but I like it
Anyone before 1 Million?????🎉
