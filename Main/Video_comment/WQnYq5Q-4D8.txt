this nga looks like a cancer patient 😭💔
I played this song before every treatment and got pumped up to fight. I won! Today my best friend started her chemo journey, I sent this song and told her how it helped me. Thank you Tom
They won't cure a damn thing it makes way to much $$$$😅
Stage 3 and Drowning 😢🤕💀
They will never release the cure for Cancer because that would be taking money out of their pockets and it would save many lives and they dont want lives saved unless its on chemo and having a 50/50 chance of living to make them rich and have a 50/50 chance of dying to get rid of people from earth. This world is a evil place. I am so glad i had a son, but i hate that i had to bring him in a world full of elites and evil people.
My Grandfather died from Cancer. I wish he could have heard this song. Thank you Tom, your music is amazing brother! About time a rapper that dont rap about ssx drugs money and killing people. We need more Tom McDonald's in the world.
as a cancer pateint, im ready when my time comes, but not a single day before!!!!!!!!
Thank you Tom and Nova for bringing attention to this ugly topic. Im currently fighting cancer. Im treating myself through diet, immune support and Rife tech. No radioactive, chemical treatments for me. Just natural and none approved and band treatments. My faith in God is all I need. If you have cancer, I'm praying for you! Stay strong and dont give up the fight.  Just want to add a note to anyone looking for a treatment that wont kill you. Research Royal Raymond Rife. The cure is out there. They know it but dont want you to.
Absolutely I believe they have a cure. They definitely are giving us cancer by all the poison they put in our foods. My husband was suddenly diagnosed with stage 4 cancer 6/25/25. Never smoked, never been sick. But he definitely knows where he’s going when and if his time comes. God is still good and God is a healer. 🙏🏻
I love /hate this song. I love the tune but the words he is singing is so true
Tbf imagine how much they could charge for a cure
I lost both my parents to cancer.. we can't do drugs they tell us it's bad it kills and hurts ppl but they can sell us cigarettes and liquor in stores
I posted this song on my timeline 4 years ago remembering my mom. 4 years later, I didn't know I'd need it more than ever as my own son is battling this nasty disease (Ewing Sarcoma).
I lost my daddy 4 years ago. Watching the transformation of what cancer did to that man.. his body and then his brain. I still cry and miss him every day. You took a chunk of my heart when God took you Dad.
Cancer treatment should be 100% free
How did I only just see this video. I'm about to lose my Dad to stage 4 small cell carcinoma which has gone beyond anything that can be done anymore. My dad fought it for so long. If cancer was a Living monster My dad put a big damn dent in it.  I seen a man who was almost immortal be worn down to a hollow shell that despite the end approaching he still holds onto hope even with Hospice coming into action when he get discharged in a few days.   I have been feeling down and trying to stay strong and prepare to become the new man of the house to watch over my younger sister and Mother whom are torn with what news we got today. This song gave me inspiration and strength in this dark time.  Thank you Tom for somehow finding your way to my music Playlist today and giving me this song.
I have cancer .................. And I refuse to quit .....................
I’m currently fighting breast cancer. It is horrible. I was never sick from the cancer but the chemo/immunotherapy is brutal. I have faith that I will beat it.  💖
We have the power to cure ourselves
It's it the cancer that kills it's the damn medicine 😅
Bullshit lies there is a cure but the elite AKA super rich people can't make $$ by curing disease,s
It would make my day if u wrote a song about multiple sclerosis to be fair this song pretty much says it all . Just not the words multiple sclerosis. I'm just suffering a hell of a lot right now.
This was so beautiful Tom
Today I got the call I have been dreading,my best friend since 6th grade,he beat cancer in 9th grade,got cancer from his blood pressure Rx,thank you for any prayers...I have listened to this song since released with my Bubba...I will forever listen to this song with tears for my Bubba...see you in heaven brother...
Tommy and those scaffold ans ze speed square was nonesense. If real Darren (Bronald) would have used his invisible ink right… he gets no blue ribbon in a black light. Drunk bastard.
I know this journey too well Tom and Nova. Thank you for all your music. I love your music very much. I was told in June that they are going to send me to the survivors clinic for a year cancer free. ❤
I haven’t listened to this song in ages!! Everything Tom publishes is nothing less than creative, but the emotions and power of this song just hit differently!
HELL is a LIE. jesus died for us all and it is FINISHED. The church crowd lies! You are loved and I have had friends who cured cancer naturally. God is concialleted to the world.. Be Conciliated back to Him.. no stress needed.. just Believe. NO WORKS JUST BELIEVE
Breast cancer has exploded in the younger women. It's an industry. They have no desire to cure it.
Dr. Lustig's book, Metabolical. Proccessed food is slowly killing Americans. Spend your money in the produce section.Protect your liver and feed your gut. Stand up against Big Pharma,Big Food and above all the lawyers and politicians that are protecting the corporations that are destroying our collective vitality.
Breast cancer fighter love your music,  n hope you tour again in Texas
❤
My wife loved this song during her treatments. She passed away on Tuesday. I'm so lost without her. 8/27/25,sleep well Traci Saunders.
Lost my 32 yr old wife stage four cancer in Dec 27,2022
Still here..8/21/2025!! Cancer won’t defeat me!! 18yrs of fighting and I’m not going to give up now..even tho there are times I want to!!
Port in and about to get chemo 4 days next week.  Had to come back n share this song with my sis.
2025 anyone?
I have lost my Mom and Sister and Dad to Cancer!!! I believe they are in a special place in Heaven!! They were the Strongest People I ever knew in my Life!!
Working with cancer patients a lot of the time as a respiratory therapist and having lost a wife to breast cancer, this song has a quite an impact on me. It's hard to avoid having a tear or two roll down your face when you listen to it with your heart.  "Goldman Sachs analysts have expressed concerns that curing patients could be detrimental to the long-term profitability of biotech companies. They suggest that the potential for delivering "one shot cures" in gene therapy and other treatments could lead to a decline in recurring revenue, which is crucial for sustaining cash flow in the biotech industry. This concern is particularly evident in the case of Gilead Sciences, which has seen a significant drop in sales for its hepatitis C treatments since the peak of $12.5 billion in 2015, due to the exhaustion of the available pool of treatable patients. The analysts' report, titled "The Genome Revolution," highlights the challenges biotech companies face when transitioning from successful treatments to cures, which may not be sustainable in the long term." - CNBC  The average salary for an oncologist in 2025 is projected to be between $315,000 and $450,000 per year, depending on factors such as experience, location, and subspecialty. - Sermo
I am fighting it now and the doctors have switched me to quality of life from here on out i can not say enough about about this song and my wife both have my heart ❤
I know so many, but the one that hurts me was my cousin he was 10 and died of cancer. I believe whatyou say in this song is true
I was in a dark place today, but I have a playlist of your music that helps me calm down. This was hitting me so hard I was getting goosebumps
So 4 years after my comment on this song,  It's my turn to fight. I just waited 14 months to get my very 1st treatment. Stage 3 is more profitable than Stage 2.
Dad.....now me....😞just long enough to tell my son how much ive missed him since she took him😢
Should  of shaved your head at the end bro     That would of been legend
I was lucky, I had my mastectomy a month ago. We think we got it all❤
That scene with the mom crawling into her daughter’s hospital bed. I bawled. That was me when my daughter was in the hospital last year. We didn’t know if she was going to get better or not. At one point it looked like she probably wasn’t going to die, but her new normal was going to be a vegetable “life”. She couldn’t wake up, and even if they could get her to open her eyes, she couldn’t speak, or recognize anyone or anything. She couldn’t eat or drink. We thought she was going to spend the rest of her life in a hospital bed, with a feeding tube and a bed pan. I just wanted her to open her eyes and recognize me, but she couldn’t. We were all so confused, and so heartbroken.   I learned a new level of trusting God during those weeks.   But I remember crawling into her hospital bed one day. I had been sitting or laying in hospital chairs in her room for about two weeks, and I just missed her so much.
Everyone is going to be pissed when they learn how easy cancer is to eliminate
I've been walking around my house trying to wrap my head around the exact words  in this song. Exact words. That's so cool Tom. Thank you I thought I was the only one. I got diagnosed in May. I'm fighting for the truth about everything you just said. peace
You CAN know where you go after you die. The Bible tells us clearly that it has nothing to do with good or bad…none of us are good enough to deserve a perfect Heaven. That’s why Jesus came and died willingly. He took all the shame, paid for every bad deed and ugly thought we ever had or did. Accept His gift—tell Him all about your need and confess that you are a sinner. He will send all your sin away “as far as the east is from the west.” In other words, it will be gone. You don’t have to carry it anymore, you can lay it down. If you are weary, if you are lonely or afraid, go to Him. I did this decades ago, and it changed everything for me. God bless you, whoever is reading this.
theres no money in a cure
im a surviver....hodgins lymphoma stage 3 without insurance 14 years remission... too survuve you gotta want... stay strong do it for you and too defy the haters
❤💯
This broke me. It takes a special strength for the family to survive and a different special strength for the sufferer to fight. I can only imagine how much of what kind.
I just found this Song! I was told I would be dead by July 2022. Was diagnosed with the deadliest, Glioblastoma 4 brain cancer on earth on May 7th 2021 After 11 head surgeries, 5 fill crainiotomies, and a ton of weed,  I am still here! Thanks Tom!
Starve to live....
I’m fighting it once more. After about four years of watching and waiting and believing it was gone to finding out it’s not only back but aggressive and attacking my bone. I’ve already had radiation and surgery in the area. The cancer is extremely rare so amputation from the shoulder might be the only curative option. My other option is “red devil” chemo which might not even work because the kind of cancer I have is rare and resistant to chemo. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. I think the hollowing out of the bone is called scalloping. This is why I think it might end up being amputated. Because what’s the point of chemo if my bone is already damaged?
Cancer had a cure since the beginning of Adam and Eve. It's called Lord Jesus. Christian Training Center of Texas.
My beautiful, sweet and kind daughter in law is fighting ovarian cancer how in this age is ovarian cancer the 5th killer of woman. Prayers for all that suffer from all cancers.
I just lost my mom JUNE 7 2025...I MISS HER SOOOOOO MUCH... FUCK CANCER!!!!!😢
sativa Indica is the cure 🎉
Cancer Survivor! I went through a living nightmare of 3 years of 32K per treatment x 24+  treatments ! (Mustard gas  that they used  in Vietnam....whatever they call it/ then another 2 years of Immunotherapy after that.) I lost 65 lbs. and nearly died for a cancer that had a 85% survivable rate.  I was a skeleton when I rang that bell. It took My husband 8 months , getting me back from a life/cancer of being poisoned.
I am ready. Stage 3 and I lost more weight in 9 months. 215 in November to 165 last week. Talking about life change. My body is eating its own muscle mass. I can't eat. If I do it is small proteins. Other than that it will not stay down. Radiation and Chemo sucks. CANCER SUCKS
I am an 18-year survivor of stage IV unresectable head and neck cancer myself.  I am one of the blessed ones. I wish we could be😢
There IS a cure!! The pharmaceutical companies block and ruin anyone and any chance that anyone else tries to bring forward, trying to bring an end to this!!   They have spent so long strategically positioning all of us just so they can make money off of our deaths!!
Amen my 🙏 go out to all afflicted
To all those fighting and all family members silently suffering watching their loved ones go through hell, you have an Army with you.  Pray to God and the blessed mother for help.  Wishing everyone peace.
Yup, I'm 62 I'm going through it, prostate cancer... a friend of mine since 1st grade, his wife just finished chemo, she's supposedly all good but we never know, a guy at work I've know for 30 years is on chemo, he's got pancreatic cancer😟Lee my childhood friend died young cancer, Mark also a childhood friend, we all lived on the same street, he died years ago cancer, Debbie, same street, gone, cancer, my dad beat prostate cancer... this is not normal.😡
Beautiful and very true.
So fuckin true. There IS a cure & treatments besides chemo, but Big Pharma wouldn't make big money!!!
Heartbreak, so many lost that wanted to live, then so many lost that threw it all to the wind.
use CDS, the treatment will kill you before cancer
I know it’s 4 years later and how I didn’t know you did this this really hits hard I’m a 7 time over cancer survivor from Michigan unfortunately I’ve seen the good and the bad but thank you for saying what I’ve tried saying but I was always pushed aside I’m so glad you could say what we all say
Im 26 years young, 2 kids, and 1 on the way. i just recently got diagnosed with hodgkins lymphoma, its cancer attacking the lymph nodes. Wish me luck 🙏🏼
"Our insurance doesn't cover it all to defeat it, and even if it does we might die from the treatment." Real talk... the chemo and radiation is toxic to the body... you just hope it kills the cancer faster than it does you... financially or otherwise...
Thank you for this video. My husband is terminal with no insurance. They gave him 6 months,  that was a year ago. 😢 my heart hurts he is my best friend 😢
Ivermectin and fenbendazole is curing cancers of all kinds😊❤! Crazy they have known about this since the 90s!  Water FASTING does wonders for the body also!!

I lost my grandad and grandma to different forms of cancer and last year my childhood friend was diagnosed to leukemia I won’t forget how I felt I was so worried and sad but I used to listen to this song over and over the lyrics are so true I won’t forget it then on my birthday I got such great news I won’t forget it I broke down in joy when I was told that they beat it
I had non-Hotchkins lymphoma marginal B cell is a sub category. It was rough. I had it from 2019 to mid 2020. It was rough especially because of Covid.
My mom died of cancer this made me cry
I have been listening to this song for years lost my dad and brother both to cancer but today it hits different a simple ct scan of my back showed my worst fear so now at 43 I'm crying like a fucking baby not knowing if I'm strong enough to see another year
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ 2025 to 2047❤❤❤❤
I'm a "survivor". It only cost me: 1 testicle, several surgeries, hope, faith, my Angel Chloe, my friends, my family, my girlfriend,, everything I was before I "survived". I haven't quit living since "beating" it. Thank You, God, for my extra time. And Thank you, Tom, for this song. You're an a God sent Angel on earth. I wish I was stronger. This song makes me want to be stronger. I didn't know you truly until this song. Thank you.
Stage3 ,,, diagnosed in 2021, still Fightin'             💪🏼🧠💛
Ol Man off grid, Amen to that Tom. God Bless Y'all.
I miss her so much
My mother died through oesophageal cancer. Much too young. your song gave us strength. I will most likely never meet you but thank you. I owe you. Thank you.
Lost a lifetime friend just over a year ago. FUCK CANCER
I love this song! He sure sing the truth about cancer. I played this song over and over again. I feel like Tom understands how I’ve been through.  Leiomyosarcoma here! The pain is sucks! 😢
2x cancer survivor here 💪 stage 3 Hodgkin's lymphoma survivor and stage 1 endometrial cancer
Thanks for telling the truth. Radiation kills😢
Powerful track! Cancer = go raw vegan & always choose a herbalist over hospitals!
I find out tomorrow if my growth is malignant or not..totally scared. But I will make it through..I'm a fighter.
The forgiven go to heaven, not the good.
I'm 47, diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia.. I'm struggling to hide it to my 4 years old daughter pretending its work related fatigue.. Cancer should just not exist..
Just finished 6wks radiation treatment. This song gave me strength every single day!
I just lost my favorite Aunt to colon cancer on March 29th. I'm so heartbroken. She was only 55 years old. RIP Aunt Bobbie. You will forever be in my heart. I love you. 🙏💔😢
9 years this August, still having 2 PET scans a year but still stable, each scan feels like a death row extension but I also understand how truly lucky I am.
Had stage 4 testicular cancer in 2019... got rid of that and then ended up with cancer in my lymphnodes in 2021... after 4 rounds of chemo which did nothing but poison me they decided to do surgery and guess what i was cancer free and still am... the chemo is nothing but a money maker sadly... god bless all my fighters i love yall
10 year this year, Breast Cancer survivor..thank you for this, hits heard, I felt every word. Yes, there is a cure.  University of Virginia research discovered it in early 70s.  It was anounced once on radio then never mentioned again.
Fuck you cancer.... 1 year ago you destroyed my family. RIP mom, you were so strong, you fought the best fight. Stage 4 breast cancer at 57.... taken to soon
For Outlaw Country singer Paul Cauthen, 39, just out the gate battling thyroid cancer.
RIP Grandma and mom. I'm a survivor of cervical and colon.
I came here 4 years ago when I was diagnosed with stage 3 oral cancer, now I'm back in 2025 with stage 4 small cell carcinoma in my heart and brain....
I miss you mom 😢
I lost my aunt to cancer... I miss her
I feel like both my parents would be alive without all the poison they killed them with... they burned my mom's insides. She had a long horrible fight. I begged both of them not to get the poison...
You always make me smile through tears  I miss my husband
My pap just passed away from cancer, he coincidently ended up with shortly after getting that jab... He fought for a strong few years, and over the past few months, it took over him and he took a turn for the worst. I sent him this song when he first told me he had cancer. My pap normally doesn't listen to ANYTHING I listen to, but he loved your song. Thank you so much. I just want my pap back... 💔💔💔💔
Lost my surfing buddy to cancer a few years back. He put up 1 hell of a fight, but it got the best of him. It's was horrible to watch what he went through he never gave up. Now I surf alone, but I always write his name in the sand before I  paddle out and back out of the 1st wave I could get. 1st  wave is his. Fuck cancer.
I cant believe I just heard this. Thank you for this song.
I can honestly say my grandma at 86 years old has breast cancer 💔💔💔 my grandparents have been married for 65 years
When something is so gawd awfu it makes one wish for ear cancer...ffs, how does this garbage have 4+M views? Oh, yeah.. people are stupid.
My father is losing his battle with Cancer it’s now terminal and he only has a few months left. Lost my best friend at 25 to cancer. This song brings tears to my eyes. Some people no matter how tough can’t overcome these terrible treatments.
Tom writes the songs that touch his base. I'm an Ex Democrat, before Obama, who was diagnosed with Cancer y'day. I've found that your songs have spoken to what I've been going through, and thanks. God bless you guys!❤✝️
I have stage 3 lung cancer also on my pulmonary artery.  How is that survival able?
My mother in law tried to fight. She gave her all and everything in her. The radiation treatment killed her, took her away from us all on the 9th this month. Our government is evil for not caring enough. She should be here with us. 🥺
💎🌹💖🦋🔥🔥🔥🔥
The US  is the only country that can't use stem cells. Ask yourself why. Big pharma
April 2024 right before my son's 1st birthday I found out I had to gue cancer. I was eating applesauce and Motrin for 3 months before I finally had my surgery in June 6th. I went from 205 lbs down to 150. Bottomed at 145lbs. My surgery required me to have 60% of my tongue removed. The entire left side of my tongue plus extra to be sure it's gone. 78 lymph nodes in my neck were removed but only 1 came back cancerous. A 2nd node came back positive of cancer a month later. 30 days of radiation to my mouth and neck plus 3 days of chemo. Most people get 60 units of whatever the med is for chemo. I was given 100 units because of my age being able to handle it. My wedding August 24th 2024 was the last day I ate food because of the moth sores. I just couldn't do it anymore. I had to take a viscous lidocaine that was swallowable and then I had 5 minutes to eat much as I could before the pain came back. I was able to eat again by Thanksgiving 2024 luckily. I had to use a feeding tube to eat between those times. I'd wake up in the mornings and my 3 year old daughter would ask if Daddy took his medicine and everytime I left the house she would ask if I'm going to the hospital again. Saddest time of my life. In order to rebuild my tongue the surgeon took a flap from my right wrist and then to cover that part they needed a skin graft from my thigh. My dad died when I was young, like 1st gradeish. I knew what it was like to not have my biological dad around and I couldn't do that to my kids. They are what kept me going honestly. My wife worked extra hours that she could so I was at home taking care of the kids while struggling to stay awake from being tired and struggling to hold them and make them happy. You can watch people go through cancer and sort of feel their pain but until you live in you will never know. Near the end of my treatments I was throwing up without notice sometimes and because my wife was at work I had no help with it. Being immune compromised from the chemo I couldn't help my wife go grocery shopping or take care of the cat we had gotten. My wife is a blessing and I appreciate her so much. To give you a picture of what it took coming out of surgery... I went from talking to not being able to speak any sounds at all. I couldn't even close my mouth because I was so swollen. I couldn't close my mouth for several days. I had to have a wet sponge apply water to my tongue to keep it moisturized. Waking up from surgery I had to keep my neck in the same position for 48 hours. I could only move my left arm and leg. My right leg was weak from the skin graft and my right arm had tubes coming out of it because of the wound vac l. I had tubes coming out of my neck from behind my ears to collect blood. I lost the tip of my tongue in the surgery which you use to speak. I had to teach my tongue to move to the left when I speak to pronounce certain sounds and still have to do it. I have to keep a water bottle with me at all times because I have permanent dry mouth. From the radiation. Sometimes my saliva glands work and sometimes they don't. I can't eat like I used to because it takes so long to chew. Most of the time my food has to be reheated in the microwave a couple times before I finish because it takes so long to eat. Going back to work after 6 months out I struggled but I did 6 days at least 9-10hours of physical labor so my wife could take a break. Cancer sucks a lot but I fought like hell. My cancer has a 40% chance to come back because not only is oral cancer one of the most aggressive cancers but cancer also has a mild, moderate or aggressive make up and mine was the most aggressive form of oral cancer. I was advanced stage 3 almost stage 4. My cancer was labeled T4AN1 I believe. The tumor in my tongue was in my tongue muscles arteries and veins meaning the seeds of it could go anywhere my blood went in my body.
I lost my wife to cervical cancer when she was 42 years old in 2008
This hit hard my mom was diagnosed with  pancreatic cancer   in 2023 and was in remission for a year and it's back I would give anything to take it away
fuck cancer...
Thank-you, Tom. I had a lumpectomy and lymph node removal in my left breast last week.  I have triple negative breast  cancer.  I added your song to my playlist.  Your compassion while askung the hard questions is truly appreciated.
Cancer is no joke 4 times im still here thank god above
Ivermectin. Fenbendazole. Menbendazole. Not medical advice but look it up. Much Love.
I have cancer and money  to treat it so this song means a lot to me do get twisted Im not scared I just know what it's going to do to my loved ones.
❤
My daughter is going through this right now and we have already lost over 80 percent of our family to cancer so as her mother im so scared but this helps me remember what a fighter i raised
Just hearing this 4 years later. 🙏
This song is sad but very true . Beautiful Tom.
Number one billboard top song for sure this could hit everybody and the message couldn't be better Thanks Tom
You're so right, everyone knows people that suffer from cancer. And Pharma doesn't do much to help apart from cashing in.
My daughter was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia when she was 5 💔 today she's 11 and thriving 🙏 made it to the survivor clinic ❤💛🎗
Had stage 4 breast cancer.  New oncology was my doctor. He made decision to try new experimental drug. 14 years later double mastectomy I'm still here. Doctor was from India. HE took a risk and I'm still here.
I listened to this song from the time I was diagnosed with cancer and every day until I rang that bell
Lost my dad dec 7th 2023 😢😢😢😢
Strong song 🎵 💪 ❤️ 💓 👌 💙
My 14 year old daughter past away after 15 months of battling brain cancer December 5th 2024. She was a fighter! I'm left with a hole in my heart. It hurts every day. I will say St. Jude took care of just about everything financially. I do believe they did everything they could to extend her life.
I first heard this in 2020 when I first got cancer... I'm back in 2024 as I start the fight again😢 chemo and radiation this time around❤
Think you tom
My aunt was diagnosed with staged four cancer and she fought a long 4 and half year battle until God took her home with him in 2021 and this past year my uncle died three days before Christmas he was my whole world they both were.
Losing my mom in law as we speak...  this shi hits hard.  :(
💚💚💚
In 2012 during work I urinated black. I immediately went to the EMERGENCY ROOM.  Two hours later I was diagnosed with stage III renal cancer with two tumors.  That day was in my mind a blessing. The tumors were both encapsulated one by my kidney and the other in my renal vain.  I was operated on 12 days later and this opened my eyes to the fact that I wasn’t living my life rather I had been taking it for granted.  I appreciate the little things that made us happy and realized that we’re all living together in the past present and future all at the same moment.  So of all the thousands of words we say everyday three are the most important , I love 💕 you.
@TomMcdonald  AND also to EVERYONE out there, who has had cancer touch thier lives.  The substance that many talked about maybe treating/curing the the 2020 cough, HAS and IS being studied for cancer treatment.  Maybe that's why Big med didn't want people taking it and why they spent so much to suppress and mock everyone over it.. 🤔🤔🤔
Genetic of benign
Love you for this ❤
Everyone that reads this needs to know that there is a cure. High amounts of THC will cure cancer. My mother was stage four inoperable, and she is now cancer free!! On youtube, there is a video called "Run from the Cure". Please go check it out.
See cancer is a bacteria you guys which means it's a carcinogen and when you actually look at carcinogens this is what they are cancer cell antibody cancer cell mutation immune system neutron cell oxygen cell for OG e for EP for bacterial and for neuron mutation ask for stroke or sinuses is Greek word route to Latin in English
im a breast cancer survivor 🫶💪🏻
This song hits really hard. My closest sister had cancer and was told without the treatment she had 3 months left. She bet it thank God. 🙏
Last year 2024 I was having a pain in my stomach that would be severely intense for a couple seconds and then would go away and this would happen all day every day so I went to my doctor. We both figured I had a hernia which to me is no biggie. Well I'm 52 so my stomach doctor said I should go in for a colonoscopy which I put off for as long as I could. I went into the hospital that was supposed to be a short stay. When I woke up the doctor told me I had colon cancer. I didn't believe him and got mad telling him I was leaving. Needless to say I stayed and had surgery the next day. They removed the cancer but I had stage 3 where it spread to my lymph nodes. After my surgery I had a different doctor tell me I would need to be put on radiation and again I got mad and told them bullshit I'm not going through that my body was made to fight disease so I will let it do its job. All my life I have never relied on medications for a cold or the flu or any sickness like that and I never take a flu shot ever. I've always believed that your body was made to fight sickness so I didn't do anything. A couple months after my surgery the doctor said I should have my blood check to see how much it has spread so I did and it came back saying that there was no cancer found in my system. So he had me go in for a CT scan to see if there was anything present and that too came out clean. I've got 6 scars from the surgery but I at least don't have cancer anymore and I'm grateful because a week before Christmas my best friend passed away from cancer so I'm grateful for the time I've been given.
Been listening to you for a while. I was diagnosed with kidney cancer two weeks ago. Just found this song. You have no idea how much I needed it. Thank you.
My dad is losing his fight and me and my sister are blessed to spend another day with him
I had cancer surgery last year, scariest time of my life and i do not scare easy.

Hey guys I have just dropped my reaction to this emotional masterpiece 😢 I have been crying for the last hour  https://youtu.be/B0b9BUogfNg?si=zBpG7BqDhB2F7Zoc
Thank you for this song Tom . I'm going through some $#/+ right now . ✌🏻❣️💪🏻🙏🏻🤜🏻🇺🇲🤛🏾
Tom, thank you for the love and your words.  A lot of us can't form them as well as your able to.  💯❤️❤️❤️👊😁👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Lost my lil fuzz butt Digit to feline cancer, she ist hurting anymore, but im still hurting several months later. I got a solid sign she was safely over the rainbow bridge. F**k cancer in all its ugly forms.
I’ve lost family too canners and now my dad could have it. To go through this again is going to be the most hardest on me💯
I've been fighting since 2021. I was 39 when i was diagnosed and I played this song on repeat to day coming home from treatment. Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer in my bones. Just trying to watch my babies grow up.
im not a fan of tom's political views but i wish my mom could have seen this video and song while she was going through cancer. Great Message Here Tom
Ive lost 4 members of my family to this deases, it makes you feel so hopeless i wish it would of took me instead!
Thank you Nova, I know you write Tom's lyrics. You do a amazing job. The two of you are amazing. I have heard they have a cure but unfortunately they make way to much $$$$. So many people have lost their lives. People have lost their loved one's. I don't think anyone has ever gone without having it or having a loved one pass. 😪😪
Tom-  I'm going through your older songs . You had never heard this one before! It's awesome!  I know that you friends who are Christians and I wish you and Nova would join us!  I'm going to heaven when I die to be with my son who got there before me ( rest in peace my son). I would like you to meet him.   He would have loved your music.  It's honest and cuts through all of the BS in this world.   Please be born again!  Love to you and Nova!
It was about 13 years ago, all at once my mom was t-boned at a junction, three cracked ribs, broken hand, crushed foot, and if that wasn't enough they told her she was diabetic, and just to really pile on the shit she was diagnosed with breast cancer on top of everything.  But she wouldn't accept that it was the end. She went in for what she felt was the bare minimum she could get away with. Didn't want to poison herself with all the unhelpful treatments. She wanted to fight it with lifestyle and dietary changes. And it went into remission not long after. They said they could barely even detect it.  About six months ago, I don't know when exactly, it came back. With a vengeance. A wretched, insidious vengeance. Slowly sapping her of her strength until she couldn't even stand up or walk on her own. We had to lift her out of her chair, and she had to cling to us for stability to shuffle through the house.  This last Thursday evening she collapsed, she'd gone completely limp, trying to talk but couldn't, we had to call an ambulance. Couple hours after they took her away we got a text saying she was stable, responsive, and ticked off about being brought to a hospital because we know how much she doesn't like those places. Thought for sure she was in the clear so everyone was sent home. But Friday morning she passed away before any of us could get to the hospital. Never even got a chance to say goodbye or tell her how much we love her.  What we thought had just been a bit of liver damage leaking fluid turned out to be her liver, both her intestines, basically everything in her lower abdomen had been obliterated by the cancer leaving the doctors scratching their heads wondering how the hell she had not only lasted for so long but was still entirely herself (albeit perpetually exhausted) right up to her final moments.  She was a fighter. To her very last breath, she wouldn't give up.  What drives me up the wall is she had finally found a primary who was 100% uninterested in "pharmaceuticals" and was completely on board with her that lifestyle and diet were the key. A doctor who had no problem saying "God designed our bodies for healing ourselves, we just have to use what He gave us." If she could have found him all those years ago maybe it would have stayed gone for good.
Lost my grandfather, dad and brother to cancer. My aunt had breast cancer, but through a double mastectomy, it was eradicated. Another one of my brothers has cancer, and my mom has Stage 4... And a few have lung cancer because of smoking. I love them but angry at them at the same time, because it feels they're taking themselves away from their family over fucking cigarettes. I am not judging at all. I am extremely sad, knowing some of my losses were preventable. I also understand at one time smoking was considered "safe," but shocker...they lied. TO EVERYONE READING THIS...If you smoke, PLEASE QUIT. I KNOW that's much easier said than done. That's not lost on me. I don't want you to go through what I watched my brother endure and what my mom is enduring. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stop. If you haven't smoked, don't even think about just trying it once. I want NOT ONE OF you to suffer or suffer the loss from at least one form that can be preventable. I socially smoked if I went out; I smoked on occasion for about five years, then one day, it hit me what I was putting in my lungs. I was able to stop immediately, and I know smoking is one of the hardest habits to quit, but you do not deserve to suffer. I know some cancers aren't preventable, but at least for lung cancer, I beg you, please please stop hurting yourself and those who love you. My heart is broken and breaking, and there's not a damn thing I can do to bring my brother back or to reverse my mom's condition. Prostate killed my grandfather and is what my other brother has. Fortunately, if caught early enough, radioactive seeds can kill prostate cancer cells... But for anyone who smokes, you're too valuable to hurt yourself; I have seen what it does, and I can't express how much I don't want you to suffer. I don't care if I don't know you personally; you don't deserve what it will inevitably do to you. Please please please please quit. You can do it. I promise you can. Also, to lower prevalence of other cancers, keep your Cortisol levels in check. Cortisol is related to adrenaline and is released when you're under extreme, prolonged stress. It's highly correlated with increased cancers of all types. But, exercise, healthy hobbies, taking time for yourself and understanding you don't have to take as much on as society tells you, will help lower Cortisol. It's also related to obesity, heart disease and a lowered immune system in general...Cortisol. It's insidious and the real, hormonal physiological effect of being overly stressed. I'm not referring to everyday stress, or stress that we encounter from time to time; I am talking about elevated stress from which you don't see relief. But, increasing natural beta endorphins, norepinephrine, oxytocin and serotonin will fight cortisol and naturally keep you healthier.  I care about your health regardless if I know your name... If this helps one person, then that means everything to me and those who love you!!!!!!  While we can't control everything, my Master's thesis was the effects of Cortisol...and I can say with certainty that lowering stress via healthy activities will interfere with Cortisol's harmful effects. Obviously I can't say by how much or how everyone would respond, but I do know stress is not just an abstract term; its catalyst, Cortisol, is real, but it can also be minimized. You're worth it!
4 years ago was diagnosed with breast cancer.
Thank you Tom.

Still listening to on Christmas day 2024 ..Whos with Me
Tom, i know your probably never gonna to read this but i don't know what to do my family needs help so bad i can't even elaborate on everything, but the worst of it that about 2 days ago my 5 year old daughter was diagnosed having not one, but 2 tumors in her poor little head. We struggling barely making it by financialy, i used to have a pretty good job but the plant shut down and now we may as well have minimum wage. I don't know what else to say aside from i want to get her the best help possible but it doesn't sound possible as poor as we are, i don't want her to die. If she does i just know that I will be at the end of my rope with nowhere left to go.
My friend just found out her dad's cancer is back and they can't do anything for him. I shared this video with her today, and we cried together. My mom survived breast cancer, so I know how scared she is. Thank you, Tom, for giving me a song I can share with her🥰
Dec.2024,still fighting,still praying 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙌✝️🛐 ty LORD...ONE MORE SAY🙌🙌🙌🙌😇😇😇😇😇⚓🪖🐺🐺🐺
Yes like my aunt I’ll always contribute 🎉I also had skin cancer ♋️ we can do this 🥀🌹🥀
It was a pain in my stomach, after 3 weeks it just kept getting harder, found it hard to even sit for very long. My wife cried and told me please go to the emergency room and get checked out. I was sure it was an appendicitis or a gall bladder issue. They took me in and did a P.E.T. scan. I went back to the room and waited for the results. When the radiologist walked in I said ok Doc which is appendix or gall bladder. He looked at me and paused, You have Large B Cell Lymphoma and it has progressed to a stage 4. Fear raced over me and an immediate feeling of defeat and doom. I swear I think I sucked all of the oxygen out of that er room. My wife bowed up and said in the name of Jesus He will not die but he will live. I have never seen her be that forcefully vocal about anything. He proceeded to show me the results of the scan showing two malignant growths. One the size of a football the other the size of a grapefruit. That was 5 years ago, today I went to my last checkup, I am cancer free. don't not go to the doctor, early detection is the best thing going. Fight while you are strong! But the best cure is faith in God, if you haven't made Jesus your Lord, I highly recommend you do! We know he is the great physician. I did the Chemotherapy, they say probably on of the strongest. It was tough, it does it's own damage! But remember God gave those doctors the talent and skills to treat your illness. But He gave you a measure of faith to trust in Him!
😭
Lost both my mom then dad. All that you get from the AMA is "too bad"
My brother died of brain stem cancer 3 days ago. He used to be a yatch captain and MMA fighter. 10 months from diagnosis until it took him. It took everything from him: his strength, his agility, his speech, his mobility, and at the very end, his breath. He was the best brother I could’ve asked for. I’m having a hard time processing. Thank you Tom for another amazing song.
I played this every day for 4 years while fighting cancer
I just lost my pop to the dreaded word cancer too he was like light in my life now all I feel is dread and emptiness 😢😢
The radiation an chemo is an cause chemo from what they told me still sucks but you fight an do whatever the "docs" say to save "" your live the say I was scared n fell in line but will see what happens 🫂🫂 prayers , love your music
Losty uncle n gpa to cancer n I got diagnosed with it in 2023, scary ya n I wonder what there hiding 💔
My Mom 1st had cancer when I was 13. I am 38 now. She was such a fighter, she best it. The 2nd round of cancer came about 6 years ago. At that time she remove the breast tissue hoping it would be enough. Although she needed sticks or a chair to help her move around, she was so strong. Last year the cancer came back again, stage 4. She kept fighting, but cancer had spread to much.  I lost my mom last May. This was the 1st Thanksgiving without her. I believe ill see her again, I thank God for how long I had her in my live. However, its still really hard this holiday weekend.
this dude is on a different level
I miss my Katie she lost her battle to cancer in 2020
I had stage 4 non hodgkin's lymphoma b cell cancer i beat cancer i am cancer free now
Ty GOD🙏🙏🙌🙌🙌5 DAYS CLOSER TO MY CURE
Lost my mom to cancer when I was just 13, which left me on the streets homeless caring for my 8 year old sister all alone at the time. Cancer is a brutal illness for sure, and in 2020 I had my own battle with it and thankfully I caught it early enough to completely win my battle. Have been 4 years cleared of it now and I am forever thankful for all the support I had from the people around me, without them and stuff like this song, those of us who fight such a brutal battle won't make it through the other side. I know 2 others who were youtubers who lost their battle in the same year I won mine, so I feel their families' pain and it's horrible to lose someone to cancer. So many people make jokes, and point and laugh at those who end up looking like aliens with no hair because of the treatments, but they have never felt that pain and I hope they never will, or they would never make such jokes. Same with any deadly illness....don't make jokes about it, it's not cool.   I've lost too many friends to cancer and I really do wish there was more I coulda done to help them through their fights too. The best thing I did for my mom was show her she was loved by a child who stood beside her no matter how hard things got for us. I showed her she could still find happiness in the end, and because of that she made it to her 40th birthday, lasting 2 years longer than they gave her when she was diagnosed. They said she'd have 8 months, I helped her achieve 3 years. And it would've been a won battle, but the doctors screwed up the radiation treatment and ended up burning her middle finger which rapidly spread cancer into her bones. From there it was all downhill and she just fell apart rapidly. I remember the last 3 days. She took me to school the first day, I wasn't picked up by her after school because she was unable to get out of bed....that's how rapidly it hit her. The next day she was put into Hospice, and the 3rd day, Thanksgiving Day, she was taken from me and it was the most devestating feeling a child could go through. I had to grow up very fast after that and work underaged illegally just to get some money to feed my sister so she would never feel pain. I ruined my health working so she could be ok. I eventually ended up in a Motocross contract (which I loved, being a girl doing that was a power statement to say the least lol), and that helped for awhile until I had a really bad wreck that screwed up my wrist and knee making it impossible to ride a motorcycle again. But it got us through that hard time, and we managed to buy this tiny home shed thing that was running on a generator. It got us through three years of hell and I finally was able to get a better job and get us a full apartment and from there things just got better. My little sister is happy with 3 kids and a caring husband now. I on the other hand am forced to live a life without another child due to cancer....it's such a shame that everything I have done and will always do to help others, I will never again have that happiness. (My daughter was shot in an alley after we were attacked on day and I lost her to that incident, then cancer ruined any other chances of having another child for me). Anyways, there is always hope on the other side of the hardest battles people will have to go through. If I could survive such a horrifying life in a city full of dangers and child predators, I know anyone else can too because I was not a strong person and it was hard but I somehow made it through. I hope this can at least help someone somewhere. Know you are not alone and you CAN make it through anything if YOU WILL IT!
I just lost my uncle to throat cancer today 11-15-24 he gave it his best vary strong man he will be missed and i lost my grandmother to cancer back in 2018 as well id like to believe there in heaven fishing together both are dearly missed.    Fuck cancer!
I prolly have a comment somewhere on here from a while ago but I lost my grandma in 2021 to cancer, now in 2024 come to find out my Pastor has cancer and a good family friend. I'm a rapper and have started a song called Screw Cancer, I came here for inspiration because it's very hard for me to right. It brought me to tears, missing my grandma and just everyone I know who has been lost in this battle.   Just to show how much this means to me Hopefully to help someone reading this  AND NOT FOR PUBLICITY  I'll post the chorus below  [chorus] I remember when he used to preach  Used to teach hadn’t been to church in weeks So I asked somebody where he went Goin through chemo gettin treatments Visit a neighbor family friend ask her how she been Cancer that’s the answer that I get I’m sick of all of it screw cancer Hold up banners in the wind It damn well matters when they win Cuz my grandma didn’t  And I miss her screw cancer I miss her screw cancer   I love you all, HOG forever.
Loved this song so much, then I was diagnosed at 18 with brain cancer, grade 4. Done radiation and chemotherapy, it’s stable at the moment probably no more treatment my oncologist said. Love the music and messages Tom keep putting the truth out there
#fuckcancer
I know this song is old just I just lost my grandpa to Cancer a month ago and this song came across Facebook and I looked it up.  Man I can't help to cry every time I hear this.       As soon as they gave my grandpa chemo pills he got way worse and was gone within 2 weeks.   Man FUCK CANCER
🥲💐🤗🙏thank you Tom , you really are god sent. I’ve been through breast cancer two times and I’ve lost my son too. Keep up the good work you touched my heart. You’re here to make a difference we ,we need people like you
This is Powerful ❤Beautiful lyrics and Masterful Chorus❤im sick and trying to quit smoking , i will play this often , it helps me in the process, Thank You Tim and Nova ❤i feel better Thx❤
This song is fire 🔥
Tom and Nova. Two Canadian’s more American than half the country!   As a US Army vet, thank you for believing in us, our way of life and our freedom!  We need to petition to get Tom and Nova US citizenship!
My mother, so fast so painful.
This song hits different now that it's hit me personally. Stage 2 thyroid cancer.
For all us going through this shit disease whether you have it or it’s a loved one like my wife keep pushing ask questions when with your oncologist ask about ivermectin rso oils fenbendazole stop the frozen processed foods eat fresh stop drinking tap water drink above 7ph water from bottles or hydrogen water and stop the Coca Cola
My dad beat cancer folks!! As of the 23rd he's cancer free!!🎉
Praying HARDER NOW THAN EVER🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💖TY DR.BURGEN🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹👍💯
Johns Hopkins did a major study on Sulforaphane from broccoli sprouts, it was very successful against cancer. So they applied for a Patent. They were told you can't patent a plant that anyone can grow. So they tossed the study and moved on to the next thing. Seems they are not looking to cure, only to make Billions
Turn away, if you could get me a drink 😖🤧
Thanks Tom, I needed to hear this just now.
Lost my brother in September to cancer after a tough long fight miss you bro
My dad hated me. I was a victim. I survived. But he thought I was the biggest burden.
Exposed to chemicals while serving in Iraq, and about to experience round 3 of cancer, this song brings tears to my eyes. Thank you for making music that touches the soul! Much love
IM STILL HERE. I got diagnosed with stage4 lung liver cancer in July 2023. The liver cancer is gonevand the lung cacer is slowly backing down. It's Oct 12 2024 and i just spit up a chunk of something about 1 inch long and about 1cm in diameter.That area it came from is open now and Im getting stronger each day.
❤ For all the Brave and Courageous young and old battling Cancer . You are LOVED , My prayers to each off you and your Family's

Aside from domestic abuse...this is the hardest battle i have ever fought.LAST ROUND STILL PRAYING 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🪖⚓🐞☦️✝️🛐NEVER GIVE UP
I belong to cancer groups on FB, not because of me, well.. when I had to go for a colonoscopy I joined a couple because I was terrified, because it took my mother at 58 years old, I screwed around, because of what I could discover that I would be next, they did find  3 polyps… one was precancerous, so I feel that I got lucky, but because I have such a heart for ppl who is fighting that fucking disease. I stayed in them, to offer support, about once every 2 weeks  I post a new inspiring message, and ask ppl if they have any good news that they want to share, imo when others hear that other people are fighting it and beating it, like inspiring them, give them some hope, support, empathy, sympathy, and compassion, even basic feelings of love, just love for other humans, that’s som😢that we are severely missing right now!   But I posted this for them tonight, and warned them, it’s a hard song to listen to, but it does have an awesome message in the chorus! And they need to hear that message Tom, thanks for creating this song. I’m working on one also, but it is rock based, kind of like Hollow or this love from Pantera. It has a soft side, but the emotions comes out in the chorus’. With a lot of ppl that fucking disease has taken from me (including 5 of my family members, 5 years in a row) a song like that is definitely hard to write, and my problem is… I have the tendency to get TOO personal and go too deep, so I usually have to think about the lyrics and rewrite the damn things 🙄. I’m just hoping that writing the song  is good therapy for me.   And sorry for EVERYONE who has lost a loved one, or has a loved one that is fighting it right now, I wish all the best to you guys!
My mom passed 08/12/2024 she was yours and nova’s biggest fan, she fought with everything in her and the surgery s but they didn’t work. Thank you for this song and all your music
Ty LORD...ONE MORE DAY AND BACK WITH THE BEST CANCER TEAM 🥰🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙌🙌🙌🛐✝️☦️☦️☦️☦️☦️☦️☦️☦️🛐✝️💪😎🐺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
I lost my dad from cancer thank you time you helped me….
I heard this song 3 years ago, and it put tears in my eyes. I looked up how I could help and found out that there was a shortage of hair to make wigs. I decided right then that I wouldn't cut my hair again until it is long enough to donate. I figured it would take a year or two since I had to cut it every month before. 3 years later, and it looks like I got another year or two to go.  It has been extremely annoying and frustrating, I've almost given up a few times, but I know that those kids are going through much more so I can deal with it.
My son (13) won 3 state championships racing MTB, and then in January, he was diagnosed with bone cancer....in April his right leg was amputated, it is now September and he just finished his 9 months of chemo.
The song is great ❤
Please people who are fighting cancer please ask your Dr if any chemo meds will affect your nerves I know because I had chemo 2x and years later it affected my nerves and now I can't walk so please ash him her that question  and remember you have cancer cancer don't have you fight god bless
Lost my dad to cancer I watched him suffer for years
Right now the best cure is early detection. Cancer is caused by numerous reasons and not all are known why. There are also many many trials that need patients and volunteers that are ended because no public interests in joining. I have always been a supporter of breast cancer it being so rampant in my family but after my own diagnosis at 35 I started getting educated and the money is not wasted at all and more is needed. Just think for a min what you’re saying to . If they made a vaccine do you really think all are going to believe in it and take it?…I mean we just went through ppl going crazy over the covid vaccine. Staying on our health and appointments and then treatment as soon as anything is found is what needs to be spread not act like doctors or people dont care and are not trying all they can do in the fight to end cancer. I love that support wants to be shown to those who have been affected. Caring for those who have been diagnosed and spreading awareness for early detection and treatments whats needed. Coming from a breast cancer survivor and advocate. I also make care packages for all affected by cancer and do public speeches teaching so I know where Im coming from having been through this and working with people going through current treatment. Thank you again for caring about cancer videos but this video is misleading and I cant say I agree with whats being said and wish it was a better message with it.

I've lost half my family to cancer and recently my good friend died of the terrible illness, I had it myself when I were 23 but I'm one of the lucky ones. I'm now 40 and cancer free although I'm mainly on my own now as everyone (family) has passed due to it and I only had my brother left but he decided to leave this world too, he took his own life . Thanks Tom for this song I really appreciate it

Just found this song. I was diagnosed with a glioblastoma brain cancer in January and given about 14 months. This song is beautiful and really brought me to tears. I want to thank you for your beautiful words. It means a lot to me. While I know that God is with me I will be okay, but I just worry about my husband and family after I am gone. That is my true concern. God Bless and again thank you for those beautiful words!
I remember my Aunts going through Cobalt treatments for Cancer. It seemed to just be a straight death sentence.
Tom, thank you for making this beautiful song.  My son went through four years of cancer treatment and the long days and nights were real.  I found God because of him, and I pray there is something after we die.  This song brought me tears as I feel like you get it.  Keep making music, keep being you and don't let the world bring you down.  You are a shining light in the darkness.

My mother's in remission, and my Dad is still fighting. I talk to God, and I keep praying. Please lord, don't let him go tonight. I know that he can win the fight.    Don't let him go!
I just didn't think enough people people left a msg saying thanks for thinking of people not only in this one but a lot of your songs if not all... thanks
I lost my mother in may 2 days before mother day to cancer and I’m completely lost
This song has so much meaning to me and truly touched my heart and soul. I lost my mother august 12th 1999 to brain cancer and have not been 100% complete since. I'm now almost the same age as her when she passed. She was 58 years old. Love you Mom always. Thank you for this awesome song Tom
And Tom McDonald you are an amazing artist.😊❤
I may be a late bloomer to this song but thank you. My husband went home to be with the Lord January 21st and 2024 I had 3 months from his diagnosis till then I miss him so much and he was such a trooper he just wanted to go home to the Lord. Michael had done 42 years flat in prison got out in 2019 and say goodbye in 2024 and I praise God I got to have him even if it was too short of time. Michael changed his life and continued it on the outside discharged parole and he was the best friend I ever had..the song touched me..thank you for sharing it and thank you for writing it. God is guiding me every step of the way. God is so faithful without Him I would have crumbled!  God bless all you guys especially those who are struggling at the loss and pain of losing a loved one.
My aunt has cancer when i found out i sat down and cryed she is like a mom to me
7-25-23 diagnosed with stage 3c invasive ductal carcinoma.  7-10-24 my Dr said, remission. 🥹
I have watched too many family and friends died from Cancer.  It is a horrible place to be for the one fighting for their life.  The family feels hopeless to help.  Terrible disease which comes from what we are exposed to everything and everywhere!  Cure Cancer 2024!
Thank You.  4 everything,
I still can't listen to this one. I've made it through it once. Hits to close to home, and I cry  like a pussy and end up changing it.
😢❤
This guy amazes me. Dude you have awesome talent.
WIfe is now 9 year cancer free, this song hit in the feels
Lost my oldest sister to cancer... the day after Christmas last year... we never had an argument our entire life she was 55 and me 54 at her death . God gave us something special ❤
That's not why you get cancer.
I wish I could of herd this song 10 years ago
Ive just completed 28 rounds of chemo/radiation followed by 8 cycles of chemo with a 46hr pump. I pray that the upcoming scans are good news but probably still need surgery and clean up chemo. The days are hard, the nights are long hits me so hard that i cant hear it without a few tears. I keep fighting so my daughter doesn't grow up without a father. I hope you all have or find something important to fight for.  Thank you so much, Tom and Nova. Ive been a fan for a couple years now but for some reason only found this song a month ago. This is my new fight song and ive been sharing it as much as i can.  To everyone fighting this demon with me, dont give up, my warriors. Also, dont forget to laugh as much as you can. Laughter has helped me get this far, and has helped me deal with these terrible side effects and its so good for the soul. Prayers for us all. May we all find miracles in our lives.
I've learned thru a lifetime of various treatments,we are lab rats,money makers for the establishment 😢,I'm at the end,I trust the LORD👊✝️🙏✡️😇😇😇😇😇☦️☦️☦️☦️☦️☦️☦️❤️‍🩹👍
REPENT>>> AND BE FREE IN JESUS>>> KING OFKINGS>>>LORD OF>>>LORDS!!!.

Old guy fan hear, been there, beat it, 10 years cancer free. What a great song, much love to you great people.
Tom MacDonald literally saved my life. Just have couple things to say before I get to that.  Please read to the end.. God Bless  It just cracks me the hell up, when Mac Non-Lethal has to mention over and over that Nova writes Tom's lyrics. Even if she does help out, who cares, she is damn good at what she does. He's just jealous because his lyrics are trash. But what gets me the most, in that lame attempt at a diss track, he mentions a few older rappers and claims they invented the political rap genre. I'm sorry, but just because a rapper might mention the president, or a war, or that 911 is a joke, in one damn song, does not make them the creator  of political rap! What an idiot! There has not been anyone in the history of rap music, or any genre for that matter,  lay down bars of political fire, over and over, saying the shit that other people are scared to say, like Tom MacDonald! Absolutely,  without a doubt, 100% , Tom is, and always will be the creator of political rap. Not only is he the creator, but he is God of this is genre!    Also, all you haters, quit trying to belittle him by bringing up the fact he was born in Canada! As an American citizen myself, I am absolutely, 100%, proud to have Tom MacDonald over here in the United States of America! In fact, we need more people like him, lots more! He stands up for this country like most Americans won't. And he does this, knowing that he will be ridiculed by many haters. That alone shows his love and gratitude for this country! Welcome to America Tom. We love you and America loves you!!  Lastly I want to say, there are so many people that Tom inspires. I know of several people who have done a complete 360 in life and have beat addiction because of Tom's message.  I myself, was diagnose with Stage 3 Esophageal Cancer which spread to my thyroid, brain and spine. Tom has a wonderful and oh so powerful song titled "Cancer". When I was given less than a year to live and damn near ready to give up, I found that song. I played it over and over, day after day, on repeat. I can literally say that I am still here today because of this song's power. I felt as is Tom was telling me personally to get the hell up, fight Brent, quit being a pussy (pardon my french)! 2 years later, here I am, in 100% remission, spending precious time with my family. For this reason, the time that Tom gave me back on earth, I will always love this man and the message that he delivers. There are artists, there are talented artists, then there is Tom! When songs do so much more make you bob your head, and change peoples life, your are way more than an artist. To many people, such as myself,  you are their guardian angel. You will always be my favorite artist of all time. Not even a close 2nd.  Tom, saying thank you just does not put into words the gratitude, love and respect that myself, my family and my friends hold for you. Keep doing what you are doing. Just know that you are doing sooooooooo much more than just making amazing music. God Bless you my brother!
My wife fought till the end. So many people made it harder on her than it should've been, and so many others tried to help. Ultimately, she was so traumatized that she was not eating or drinking and hypoglycemia beat stage 4 cancer to the finish line. Just like @temijinkahn511, I prayed to God to take me instead.
Just found out my best friend has cancer and treatment is a guaranteed death sentence she's not fighting she's living the time shehas left i love you laura
Metal cancers from vaping can be solved by medication that extracts the metal from your body
I've been doing research on cancer and found that it comes mostly from dirt and insects like ticks.

I had kidney cancer back in 2015. It was caught early enough that all they did was they completely removed my entire right kidney. Didn't have chemo or anything after.
Listening to other songs you’ve done. Lost my sister in law, her mom, her grandma, four family friends and multiple friends to cancer… I hate cancer 100%. My nieces grew up without their mom. So my mom and me had to look after them with my brother…

Cancer                                  Why cancer?   Do you get to pick and choose? You’re not a fair one to bargain with     Taking my loved one’s away from us all Yet, you seem to let some beat you at your own game    You’re slowly taking my best friend away  The one whom I call mom    She’s been there for me when I’m in need For all of these years    I still want and need my mother around  For many more years to come     Cancer, You’ve already have taken my third grade teacher from me,     And don’t forget my friend  Tim along with my friend Trish, Some are quite lucky to have beat you,      Seemly enough taking the ones that I’m close to except for one, You’re taking my mother from us all      With no damn regard Watching you do this to her     While seeing another one live beating you, who is a monster to others? My mother who hasn't harmed a soul?     Cancer I want to be just rid of you for once and for all You shouldn’t even exist within our     Realm of reality Just take your ugliness and painful vengeance spirit far from my world and to never look back      No one wants you around cancer, I hate you cancer     You keep destroying not only my life, Along with so many others      You just shouldn’t exist at all  Go away and never ever come back           I HATE YOU CANCER!!!!!!!  By: Danielle Nicole Todd
Just One             More Day With You,  Mom  You Just never really realize just how much     A person truly means to you Just on how much that person truly     Showed how much they’ve cared for you Now, that person is no longer near me    Within the rest of my days  Every day I say to myself    What  I wouldn’t give to  Just have more morning or evening with that person     Or just to be able to pick up the phone and just talk about our day How hard it is, to really accept the realization    That I can no longer come by  To pop in just to say hello and have laughs    Mom, every day since you’ve passed on that October day, It has been really tough on me     You’re my everything Now, to not having you near my side with each new day     Mom, I don’t know if you can hear me    When I would talk out loud or  Just when I would began to cry     Just missing you more and more You were the glue of us all     That  I’m trying to be You already know that both of my siblings doesn’t care   Too much for me I feel so alone more so than ever   Now that you’ve parted from this realm of your life Just wishing for more phone call, one more car ride, one more day   Just really one more of everything  Love you and truly missing you   Mom, Love your oldest daughter    Danielle Nicole Todd                                      dedicated to my mother  RIP Tammy Lynn Sassi

i lost my grandma to cancer she tried to hide it from all of us after she got it the second time she even flipped the car on the freeway hit a utility trailer that was open and ramped it at 70 years old... at the same time my Dad was breaking out with vasculitis had a fever and such and told her "i'm sick i don't want you to catch this" she told my father "I don't care come by and bring the kids" (me and my brother) after this my dad told us he was concerned. because she had never acted this way,  2 months later she came to easter and we saw the lump. i'm the same I won't tell anyone that i'm struggling with medical issues I just keep telling them the doctor hasn't diagnosed it but we are chasing it running more tests that i cant afford thanks to the system
This song now has a new meaning to me. My mom is dying of cancer, and I am being tested for cancer. Honestly Fuck cancer. I just pray my mom is headed to a better place like my dad. But it fucking sucks. Her cancer was caught too late. No cure, no hope. Tom, I hope to see more fight songs for your fans we need this. Love ya HOG fam. R Lynn
Chemotherapy is nothing more than mustard gas
This really makes me 😡 it's bullshit there is a cure out there but can't make ,$ buy curing cancer 😮😮
Dealing with recurrent cancer now, though it's a slower growing variety. Casts a different hue on life, remaining time, etc. whether one has the strength or energy to change course or not.  I hope you're still in remission.  I hope you found your center and inner peace; it's easier for me to find a greater amount of those things sometimes than others, but mortality and the humility that travels with it has helped.  Peace to you.
And your my favorite rapper ❤❤
I had stage four neroblastoma wen I was three years old and here I am now 8 years old alive
anytime i listen to this track I`m sad, the story behind the music hits hard when you`ve had an encounter before.
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 this song is emotional it's teach a lot
I've lost friends and family to cancer through the years and now I'm battling it myself.  So just wanted to say thank for this.
Im killing cancer, cancers killing me.😢
This song ❤
im not crying...
My dude with no biomedical background is saying why we still have radiation.   Heavily sponsored cancers have had larger curative treatment options than obscure cancers. But with the money pumped into it, it just demonstrates how encapsulating the disease is.  So many cancers now are not death sentences now, even less researched like sarcomas. Is there an issue with allocation of capital in the charitable/research sector yes. Are high incidence cancers allocated more funds over research for cancers smaller yet emotive groups, yes. Equally does research progress even within rigid chemo regimens for neglected cancers show progress? Yea. My cancer meant death in the 80s. And yeah in the 21st century I’m alive. Radiotherapy sucks. It can lead to another cancer but it saved my life. Fuck these pseudo scientists who pretend to understand when I followed protocol and am alive despite everything.
I'm a breast cancer survivor, going on four years remission. This song spoke to my heart. Thank you for it.
Thank you Tom for your message you help so many people you just don't even know keep rolling keep rolling
So sorry to hear about your son 😢
Lost my mom from cancer last may 6 days before her birthday
My father is battling as well and it hurts so much! This song is honest f*king truth!! Sadly, my dad isn't doing good and it's getting harder every day. Thank you so much for this song. Love you all!
This song touched me a lot! Just beat kidney cancer, not as server as some cancers, but sure took everything I had to keep going! Repaired one kidney and removed the other! Life's to short! Be strong and keep going everyone!!!!
I am only young and I worry of cancer. How it will eventually take us all. God, I hope not. I lost my dad to a blood clot in the brain. I don't want to loose my mum and sister. Anyone is who is going through chemo, you're stronger than you realise. Hope is good medicine. I pray everyone has good health. And also, ALWAYS listen to your body. Never ignore warning signs. No one knows your body as much as you do.
Word
I was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer 6 years ago and I just stumbled upon this song and it brought me to tears
Man. He knows how to hit where it hurts
As someone who lost her nine year old cousin to lymphoma this song really hits deep. She definitely was a fighter though.
At stage 4,was just diagnosed with a malignant neoplasm of the lung . Praying 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙌🙌☦️🛐✝️

My dad put me on to your music. My grandmothers last two husbands died from cancer, and she beat cancer twice... i know how she holds it to together, but say its her faith in god doesnt do her justice... shes a literal super hero. Amazing song Tom!
my 2 year old was diagnosed with Leukemia a lil over a month ago we are staying in the Ronald McDonald house in vancouver so he can do chemo at vancouver childrens hospital
Jesus….
Great song.   Stage 3 cancer didn't get me but the heart disease from chemo is gonna take me down.  1 ❤ attack , 7 angioplasty and 1 open ❤ surgery and apparently side effects of chemo.
Having recently been diagnosed with brain cancer, this song hits home hard. Thank you Tom.
Both of my parents died from it....3 weeks apart...im.destroyed for life
Yet another song that hits deep. I sent this song to my Nana who is a survivor, through multiple recurrences. She loved it as well. Been listening to your music for years now and I grow to appreciate it all more and more every day. God bless you and Nova.
My youngest daughter is mom to my youngest grandson. Nov 2023 we found out that her boy had incurable, metastatic, inoperable, very rare brain tumor. They gave him 12-18 months. She shared this song, knowing that I love this artist! Thanks,Tom for having the talent so that my daughter and grandson have a deeper connection! ❤️
I have colon cancer that has metastasized to my lungs, liver, and spine. I have been fighting it, but it gets hard. This song is an inspiration. Thank you.
Still hoping and praying 🙏🙏🙏🛐☦️✝️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I lost my two favorite people in this life to Cancer of various forms... Living with Cancer/Someone with Cancer, is one of the most painful experiences I've ever had to deal with.. Faith aside, nobody is ever as prepared as they'd hope to be when that loss comes 😢❤
this guy has more common sense than every single democrat in congress.. its amazing how he points out the obvious...  even when its every day conflict..  dont stop..
My father the strongest bravest man I’ve ever known, the man who prayed for me relentlessly all the times I deployed was diagnosed with Cancer last month, I don’t know much about it but I do know it’s spread to his lymph nodes and a few other places. The doctor wanted to put him on medication to stop the spread but it was 15k a month and insurance wouldn’t cover it. When he told the doctor no he was surprised but my father bravely told him I’d rather save the money for a burial plot.  Low behold there was a much cheaper older medication covered by insurance the nurse told us about when the doctor left the room…..  these doctors don’t care they get money and kick backs golf trips and dinners for prescribing these medications and are full willing to watch great men leave this earth so they can keep their connections…..  It’s hard seeing your hero face the fight you know he has and even harder when you know they just use cancer to bleed us dry before we die.
I lost my oldest son to cancer at 28yrs old. I've survived cancer 3 time's and I helped my mom and sister both who had colon cancer. I'm now dealing with this dreaded disease again both my boyfriend his brother have cancer.  God why can't we just put an end to this awful disease. I've been on both sides of this terrible disease and both sides are so heart breaking.  All you have is God, Faith, and Prayers. Sending best wishes, love, strength, and prayers to everyone dealing with cancer.  You are not alone. I love you.❤😢
Found tom couple ye back when I was diagnosed with kidney cancer,had tumour and kidney removed, now its 2024,looks like I got it in me lungs now so I'm probably fucked,but bless you tom you moved my heart gave me strength ,,biglove to TOM MACDONALD ❤❤
I've seen a video of a guy that talks about dog worm medicine he's taking that he says cured him. Look it up, thought I tell people about it. He was diagnosed terminal, only months to live. He is still living.
Made me tear up a few times. Beautiful song and one of my favorites.
Lost my mom to cancer and my grandmother is fighting her second round like a champion like her daughter is and was. This song says how I feel. Tom... You make me proud of all you say and do. Thanks to you my fellow Canadian. I'm a B. C BOY myself 😏
Best artist of the holl fucking world!!! ❤❤❤only love 🎉❤

Money changes nothing, now we got it all in the royal final on the news.

Found this song years ago, i never thought when i was 24 id be diagnosed with leukemia, i have survived it and im almost 26 now, thank you tom
If I ever get cancer not seeking treatment - I’ll fight it till it weakens my body - but it can’t break da soul remember that ppl with this disease , it can’t kill ur soul 100%
Just lost my wife to breast cancer August 10th 2023. Still morn her. Going to counseling for it.  Thank you Tom McDonald for this.
I just lost my father to his fight started out with cancer in his neck then had it removed and do the chemo and radiation they said he was good then 3 months later it was in his brain he did a gama knife they said they got it and 3 more months it was back and bigger they did surgery and he went down hill he ended up hemorrhaging and the drs would not do a ct till it was to late I lost my best friend and it’s been hard every day
There's not enough profit in cures,  they just prefer to "manage" it the rest of your life.  I was diagnosed with leukemia April 19 2016, immediately started chemo.  In 2020 after 5 different treatment regimes I was told there was nothing else they could do and I was being transferred to palliative care against my wishes.  I told the oncologist I would no longer be using his office and transferred my care. My new team tried one more established treatment which failed and then I was offered a clinical trial for a new drug from a Chinese company.  That drug had more effect in 8 months than everything else ever did and over the year after that completely killed it. Kicker is the "new" drug that has been so effective isn't new its been in circulation for years in China. Regulators and their financial backers have made it almost impossible for the drug to get into the US even under a clinical trial.
Radiation was the worse on me. Chemo was hard but not like radition. Then the after and the damage. Wont go into detail.
Amazing song. Thank you Tom
'don't give up & know thyself' no truer words ever spoken; we are frugivore spiritual beings, not evil flesh eating orcs like in the Lord of the Rings; Yehshua said: Is it not written in the prophets, put your burn't offerings & away with them, & cease you from the eating of flesh. For The Eternal One said: I spoke not to your fathers or instructed them, when I brought them out of Egypt concerning these things. But this thing he commanded saying: Obey my voice & walk in the ways I have instructed you, & you will be my people, & it will be well with you. But they harkened not nor inclined their ear. [Essene GOP] ... will this voice fall on deaf ears here?
There is a CURE but there isn't any MONEY in CURING PEOPLE!!! DISGUSTING...
24 years ago I lost my dad to cancer. And 5 months ago I had to relive the nightmare with my mom 😢. I'll never be the same.

🎉 Cancer free October 20th 2023  fooled everyone” terminal” they said but I’m still kicking!
I lost my wife on Jan.20.2024 from stage 3c  cervical cancer. She was diagnosed in May of 2023. Now I'm a widowed Dad of 2 wonderful kids 8 and 10. She went through all the treatment the first go around but found out that in December of 2023, that it had failed, we were planning a new treatment that was to start on Jan.24. But she never got to start it. All I can say is that she never stopped fighting, but the cancer had other plans.
I'm a 24 year old daddies girl and my dad told me last night that he doesn't think he can take the treatments anymore. He's fought for two years now, the chemo stopped being effective to treat it and at this point is just keeping him barely alive and miserably sick. I went to his house last night to tell him that if he is  only doing the treatment for me and my kids he doesn't have to anymore and before i even had the chance to tell him he told me that he can't keep going. Woke up this morning and had to give this song another listen and let the tears flow for a minute.
I kicked it so did my sister my oldest sister died from same cancer female cancer😢😢😢
Meaningful rap.
Thank you so much Tom for making this the song it really means a lot I just lost my sister last week to brain cancer and it's been so hard just feel so lost right now.😢

Cancer sucks. Ive been on a clinical trial. Was given 6 months but now i dont pay shit but wen shit goes south it ends. Im okay with that. I was given more than i thought
Do they know they are clones? They must right? Like Bobby Ritchie. People who don't recognize the fakes were never real fans.
This is so encouraging. Tom you’re the best!!!
This song still make me want to hug everyone

I know it's hard to keep on going When every day feels like a fight But you're a warrior, you're a fighter And you'll make it through the night  Living with cancer is tough But you're tougher than the rest You're a survivor, you're a hero And you'll pass this test  The road ahead is long and winding But you'll find the strength to carry on You're surrounded by love and support And you'll never be alone  Living with cancer is tough But you're tougher than the rest You're a survivor, you're a hero And you'll pass this test  There will be days when you feel like giving up But don't let go, don't give in You're stronger than you know And you'll win  Living with cancer is tough But you're tougher than the rest You're a survivor, you're a hero And you'll pass this test
when you are happy you enjoy the music, But when you are sad you understand the lyrics...
Love this song. I'm in the hospital right now due to cancer
How in Gods name do you sing songs of my heart! I’m a survivor of stage 3 HER2 breast cancer. No one in my family’s history has had it. So many people told me how I got it. I’m a non-smoker/ non-drinker/ non-druggie and the crap that was told me from having a garden to eating bad foods! All that and fighting for your life. I had a cocktail of chemotherapy. I looked at one of my bills and one of the chemicals being pumped into my port was over $20,000. I don’t know how much the other chemicals cost. It’s about money not a cure for it. You and Nova are unbelievably talented❤❤
Thank you for making this song it touches my heart as what we all think n say that has been threw this with our loved ones. I love your songs that speak truth relentlessly. Passionately what people wont say. I was working out today  stumbled on this 1. 10 years since my mom passed from colon cancer. Well done on hitting th nail on the head.
I am a survivor. I am the luckiest man to ever get this horrible disease. I had bladder cancer. I only knew for about 2 weeks before it was removed. It hasn't come back yet. It's been 10 years. I lost a kidney but I'm normal now. Whatever that is. Thank you for this song. For those who are not as lucky as I was/am. Godspeed.
My girlfriend has cancer. It's super hard on her of course and hard fir me and her family knowing we can only do so much. Thank you fir this song man. I listen to it once a day.❤🖤
Praise God. He's got you in His hands
I cryed when I first heard this song my mom has stage 4 cancer she was going through radiation and it was helping the mass that in her liver now she is back to doing chemo and her hair is falling out to anyone that has family answer them phone call talk ab anything and everything with them abd spend all the time you have with them
TOM THERE IS A CURE ITS CALLED ANTIPARASITIC MEDS AND ANTIBIOTICS ANYINFUNGALS IN HIGH DOSES AND IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH THE TEETH Meridian. Chart  Look up doctor Simon Yu it’s the American doctor and he has real patients .. not the Canadian doctor Simon yu .  He’s an older man . He gives very boring lectures but he’s right !
Love you brother ❤
U saved so many lives
Healthcare is so inefficient and you would think more advances would be available and be more affordable. It's so awful that people have to die because they can't afford treatment. This song is powerful. I hope one day I can help fix it.
Want to live on Mars but stil no cure for cancer
Anyone with a brain knows it’s all about money and power to the drug companies!  I watched what they did to my Mom and Sister inlaw
Merry christmas to all people in hospitals. Especially the young ones. 😘
I still think the treatment is deadly...not the disease.
My uncle tried for 10 years and died when i was 6
Yes so true..🙏🌹❤️....!  ,💯💫🌠
And why do people not like Tom? He is the only rapper that cares for every problem we face in the world. Call him corny? Ok …just know he loves you ❤ Thank you Tom and Nova for saving peoples lives more than you know. #HOG4life
So true, ❤️
Ich habe mehrere Male erleben müssen wie meine Liebsten unter Tumoren leiden und auch sterben mussten…. Liebe und Kraft an alle, die auch gerade kämpfen ♥️ Du bist stark du schaffst das ♥️
Sick but true…..all bout the cash flo
Sad thing is cancer will never go away. It's a business.
i miss you Yeni :(
💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸
no clue,... ...dont know what i heard about that,...
I lost my friend to brain cancer yesterday.   It Started elsewhere in her body, and she fought for 5 years with multiple treatments.   It spread to her brain months ago, and she lost the fight.  May Deb rest in peace.   She fought hard and long.
I have been telling my husband this for years. Thank u for saying better. May this will wake more people up.
I'll prey for all ur families who is fighting this battle my sister in law has been fighting this battle for about 3 years
A year ago I posted about being in remission but it didn't last, now I'm back to chemo treatments again because I have breast cancer now when I was in remission for ovarian cancer so right now this song is personal and I appreciate it so much. I listen to this when I feel like giving up especially since I don't have insurance and I don't qualify for insurance despite being disabled and on disability. I got my most recent bill, it's $5,863.97 and I'm too ashamed to start a go fund me and too scared to ask for help, so I struggle to pay it with my disability money and that's why I appreciate this song as a reminder to not give up
I painted my bike breast cancer 🎀 pink to spread awareness. My family knows cancer pain
I lost my Nephew to a rare CANCER. He was 18 months younger than me. More like my brother than my Nephew. Still haven't got over it. That was 15 years ago  My dad stage 4 Is pancreas. Dont know how i will react when.... Who knows that might be the straw that brakes me especially after losing my wife an daughter. Fuck life
My aunt died of cancer.  It changed my complete outlook on life.  Like Life is short death is much longer. I started seeing beyond the flesh and  looking at other individuals around me differently.
I was diagnosed in August with breast cancer. Have gone through surgery and radiation coming up on my year so far all is well. I believe this song is so true.😂
I am 56 and and have stage 4-C (end life) nsclc and finding his music has helped me through horrible treatments every 21 days. Comforted me when it's at it's worst, I just crank it up and its ok somehow.  His words have boomed though head phones and strengthen me do hard, hard things like plane my end of Life services, donated and reduce excess belongings to women's shelters and as sobering as these things were to accomplish I found that I gained a sense relief and control when I've never felt more powerless. I found his song CANCER and I was blown away,  😮how did he know what I felt .... I play this loudly in the treatment center for all the patients and staff on treatment day. Many tears come but not for gloom but from an unexpected connection with you. Even staff have asked how to find Tom's music.  The Love is sincere from the hearts of even the weakest at Virginia Cancer Institute and extends to the mental health support staff. I hope you know how many people you inspire to " live like we never heard of Cancer" 🎉 Thank you to the HOG family for welcoming me home, these are truly amazingly  individuals and we got your back 💯   Thank you Mr. Tom and Thank you Ms. Nova ❤❤ # legacy secured, well done! All my Merch. Will be left for future patient to experience.
There is a new publication about using methadon as a catalysator for cancer chemotherapies. Dont give up!
Thank you!! I was diagnosed with glioblastoma in September. I really needed this song right now.
Was diagnosed with cancer in 2013 had two seizures then was taken to the hospital had brain surgery and lost function of my right side for a time after my coma but was able to walk a few months in lost sight in both eyes in the right peripheral because of the surgery. I have to say the worst part about this whole time (other than my entire leg cramping at night or how when I was getting feeling in my hand again I would death grip things) was my mother stole my pain meds for her own use and had me put on antidepressants when I wasn’t depressed and doing the poor me bs with my nurses (at least I took a 💩 on her face when they had to wipe me) then when I got out after I could walk with a cane I went to high school found the love of my life in senior year  I’m cancer free (still gotta check on the benign tumor) and I’m with the woman I love though there has been more bs and drama in my life I’ve worked on cutting said drama out and I’m happier now than ever so anyone who is dealing with it now keep your spirits high that’s how I got through it I know it’s hard at times but it will pay off you have people around you that care for you and want to see you succeed in living your life and I try to do that whenever I run into anyone going through it try to keep spirits high
y son has seizures...can be up to  2 a second....this imagery is legit and perfect. the need to hold our little people is solid...thank you Tom....
Been a month since my mom passed of cancer one year since my dad has even though the song has something to do how about cancer patients I feel like it's all about cancer victims the ones who has it and the ones who never did but close families to the one who did this song keeps me going when I'm throwing down thank you so much for the lyrics
I sadly, believed this wanker in the beginning.  He targets anti grubberment people... then hits you with the biggest lie to humanity... up in  "space" 😂 See who he's connected to & you'll see he's a shill. Blubbering about what you want to hear. All the while, setting you up for the real lie.  Fake space 😂 Look up operation fish bowl. An experiment by this jokers grubberment 🤔
Lost my dad a month ago yesterday, coming back to this song regularly has brought me a bit of strength, and sometimes that makes all the difference.. thx Tom. ❤️
I’ve lost 2 family members 2 cancer. This song really hits hm 4 me. This was a sad & beautiful song @ the same time. Thank you 4 ur passion. 🖤
Tom is a good man, gives people hope to fight and try to enjoy life. How can people see him as bad? We love you Tom ❤
Crazy
Unfortunately as much as you fight... angels still resue the souls.. lost my mom AND mother in law 1.5 years apart... one a smoker and one who wasnt... both lost to Lung Cancer. Life has not been the same. But my husband and I and our kids are all we have left.. and our kids... are still apart of our mothers and we hold them close ❤
Literal tears and goosebumps evry time
Hey Tom could you please say a prayer for my sister we just found out she has stage 4 brain cancer thank you and God you and your family.
Great song Tom  crew, I'm still on the fence about treatment, not sure i wish to go that way, there is no cure, I'm not too fond of the sound of the false promises of treatment for a possibility of a little more time, for me its quality over quantity, watched to many families go through hell and the results were the same in the end,  Overall, the 5-year survival rate for liver cancer is about 17%. For people whose cancer is found before it's spread outside the liver, the 5-year survival rate is about 31%. The 5-year survival rate for liver cancer that has reached nearby organs or lymph nodes is about 11%  HCC  liver cancer stage 3
Lost my grandma to lung cancer and now my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. She just lost health insurance and I don’t know what we’re going to do. We just had a kid and all I can think is how unfair it is to him.
So true….
Lost my mom from cancer in the lemphnoid ( how ever it’s spelt) this made me tear up thinking back. 13 years soon 11-19-2012. Lost her 3 days before thanksgiving.
This song hit hard, my daughter was diagnosed with ovarian cancer that has spread to her bladder and colon, her Doctors have stopped the chemo because the cancer doesn’t respond to the chemo.  I  would gladly trade places with her.
A schoolmate was diagnosed with cancer twice at a very young age she survived she was a friend but the cost was she new nobody not even her best friend me Luekimia is what she was diagnosed with I showed you her and she was stunned keep making music that touches our hearts Tom thank you
This song hits hard love his music n going threw breast cancer, lost family to it too, mentally an physically fighting the battle l is hard, true never know how to handle it till you get the news 🫂💔
Lost my uncle to cancer, my gpa had it an is gone too an I have cancer too an been fighting but I hurt so much an emotions are crazy 😭😭
Im waiting for an appointment to find out if I have cancer. I pretend that im not afraid, but instead im so damn scared and feel so alone because Im supposed to be the strong one.😊
God does answer prayers,TY TOM FOR THE COURAGE TO KEEP ON FIGHTING.LOVE TO YOU,NOVA,LOGAN...THE HANGOVER GANG🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🪖🪖🪖🪖🪖👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍✝️✝️🧖🧖🧖🧖💕💌
Diagnosed with Kidney Cancer at 33, Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma. Been a little over a year since it was diagnosed, i went to a very dark place, still kind of there. I got insanely lucky, kidney stone in my right kidney, found the cancer on my left, i think it was late Stage 1, early Stage 2. I gave up and still dont quite understand why I got to survive when so many other people do not get to, its not fair in my opinion. But this song...this song is incredible and I heard it for the first time today and have been listening to it on repeat.
This song goes out to anyone that loved n lost special people in your life xxx rip my beutifull wife n soul mate vicky Headleand, hill x miss my lady Victoria x I got dealt another queen. I'm so blessed. Cancer can effect anyone but it seems to be the good n loved ones.
They have the cure. They’ve had it for years but they won’t put it out because they would lose money. Plus any doctors that have managed to cure it get offed.
Beautiful. Lost 2 aunts.
They're losing their minds in Chicago - Chicago meeting turns ugly as residents protest planned migrant camp in local neighborhood: 'Nobody asked us'-DEMOCRATS ARE GIVING AWAY POLITICAL POINTS-Trump 2024!!!!!!!!!!
INFLATION still destroying us - IF THEY WANTED inflation to drop to the manageable Trump levels they would stop all of this bloated and harmful spending and expanding the federal government - they don't care about us - we are inferior to them!!!!
I have cancer, My brain and left frontal lobe was diagnosed at 27 years old benighn. I had a brain opration then and more after that, First one left me with epilepsy, lost memory, feeling different and never felt like i should be or i used to be, I lost my job I lost a girlfriend and my new born son due to leving me for being so different and arguments. Did not get that then but now i do. I am now 45 years old, I have had two new kids got a wife all looks good until this reality hits home again. I have had 5 brain surgerys on my left front lobe and one shunt put in. I went from grade one to grade two then to grade three. (Grade 3 is the main shake knowing now it is cancer), Still have epilepsy still have pretty much zero memory and now am tired most of the time or lacking energy all the time. Life hits hard sometimes I get that but most dont. I wake up thinking "glad i woke, today is a new day". Life goes on and we all live it. Pray to the world we dont struggle but yet again we do. Cancer fuck you fuck everything to do with you. Ruined me and people around me. Well done Tom about time someone said the truths about cancer.
The reason is that there is no cure for Cancer is because Cancer changes it's D.N.A every day and is not like the normal Covid 19 or Cold that doesn't change it's own D.N.A but they are still working on Cancer and to find a way even today to find a break through but it is very difficute. I am very sorry to say this but please keep up the fight inside yourself .
Weird how they have been trying to cure cancer for so long but pharmaceutical research yielded treatments that allows HIV to essentially be non- existant 🤔
Has me crying man. My nephew was 15 he lost his battle June 18, 2023 to Osteosarcoma. Fuck Cancer! I miss him so damn much can't seem to find a healthy coping mechanism just trying to spread them out evenly and distract myself because I can't accept the fact that he's gone.
Lost my dad to cancer now waiting for moms biopsy results…it’s too much
THIS IS SO SAD😭
My wife was just diagnosed with cancer.
*°EDIT°* I BEAT IT. 🥲🥹 I am now cancer free and they called me Cured.  Hang in there fam. ❤ Sending all my love. Fuck Cancer. ❤   I am a cancer patient, waiting for the official diagnosis of "Remission"... It has changed my whole life. Radiation killed my thyroid, chemo .... Yeah .. you know... I have lost my ability to sing, to speak even some days. .... My 11 year old daughter worries more than she ever should .... Thank you for this song Tom. Seriously. ❤️
As a cancer (lung) fighter, this hit
My father has t*stical cancer and is very not well 😢 this song gives me hope and the lyrics are so meaningful 😊❤
I lost my grandfather, my step grandfather and my great uncle to cancer. Ever since then I refuse to talk about cancer due to it.
Their cure killed my mother.  As far as I am concerned Dr. Dumas and big pharma murdered my mother.
There is a cure! It took a doctor and a scholar 250 yrs ago to turn what God created ( everything found in nature diluted and potenized) into a cure for all chronic disease its called homeopathy. It helps the body heal itself. But conventional medicine rejected him and still does because Tom is right it's a trillion dollar industry. Want to heal seek homeopathy.
Lost my momma to lung  cancer and my grandmother to leukemia my grandfather to stomach cancer 😢 my step mother beat breast cancer 2 times ❤ this song breaks my heart. I pray for every cancer patient and family members who have to watch this disease take control of their loved ones lives. I took care of my momma hoping she would beat it but she lost her fight 2 years ago the 23rd of October 😢😢😢 big pharma do the right thing give these people their lives back. 🙏🏻
Here I am 2 years after this song was made. Been having symptoms of esophageal cancer for 8 years now. I went to the VA and argued it for 8 years. They kept telling me, "It's all in your head. It's just anxiety disorder. You need to go to mental health." I was sent to the Covid Convalescence Clinic. A doctor called me and asked me if I wanted to participate and see if there are any lingering symptoms or damage that needs to be addressed. I said, "Sure, let's check it out and see what's up." She scheduled a CT Scan of my lungs and I went to the VA to have it done. A couple of days later, I had just finished an argument with my wife about some stuffs and the phone rang. I answered and put it on speaker. It was the doctor and I didn't expect anything to be said. She asked me if I had some time to go over my CT Scans. I said, "Sure. What is it?" She said, "Well, it doesn't look good. The CT Scans show some emphysema and nodules on your lungs, approximately 3.3mm in size. It's okay, though. Hopefully they are benign and we can just maybe do some treatments to remove the nodules or something. I am going to schedule you to see a pulmonologist." My wife was devastated, you could see it in her face. We just lost my grandmother to lung cancer in February 2020. Now, here we are, 3 years later, I am 36, soon to be 37 this December. And, I am looking at a potential death warrant. Not exactly how I saw my life going. But, there isn't anything I can do about it. I have two children. Child one is a 12 year old girl, beautiful, looks just like her mother and she is the sweetest little redheaded girl. Child two is a 2 year old boy. He is autistic, but he has a beautiful heart of gold. He smiles and laughs almost constantly. He is always so interested in exploring this world. Even if he can not speak yet, he still does what he can to communicate with the world around him. I love them both so much. I have gone into hyperdrive to find the most effective ways to make as much money as possible to make sure their lives are completely comfortable without me here. I couldn't imagine leaving them in this world without the means to make a decent life for themselves and have everything they need. Lord knows the government will do everything in their power to take everything from them with my passing. They will lay me to rest with a soldier's burial, but the honor stops there. They will rape my family given the chance. So, I just have to make sure i lay it all before their feet and plan it all before I go. From what I understand, I have about 5-10 years remaining. I better make those years count. Cause we all know the doctors aren't in the business of curing, but the business of making money. And, we all know how the VA is, the less of us there are, the less they have to spend and the more they can put in their pockets. Here's to my last 5-10 years on this planet. Hopefully, for my family's sake, I am successful in my endeavors. Fingers crossed!
Back again, my cancer came back. Stage late stage 3. Alone in this.
Mom died today from Parkinson which is a form of cancer  her 11 battle  she was a spokesman  since  late 90s and a director  of wic and hated all rap but a very few songs from u thanks for the song with be played at her service   thanks u helped last year with my dad's service
Stay strong, my hart go out to everyone struggling with cancer,  Even the parents that have kids struggling cancer. I pray in the future my kids don't end up with cancer. Cause I know I wouldn't be able to sleep knowing my kid has a possible of dying before me besides the fact of all the corruption there is already out in the world.   I probably would be screaming a God every night even if it wasn't his fault, saying take me instead you fucking basterd. Its not their time yet.
They have had the cure for cancer for a very long time. This rap says it all
that was heavy, but sent a surge through me as i listened, thank you so much brother, inspiring for sure, just was told im stage 4 colorectal cancer, ive had it a good while apparently, for a long time i just thought the things i was feeling was exhaustion from working my ass off, doing double shifts without much but maybe 4 hours of sleep a night, but then the bleeding started and more and i put off going in to get checked out, but for a few months i had my suspicions, kinda knew i my heart i was in trouble, doing chemo and some home witch doctoring of my own with fenbendazole, home made cbd/thc full spectrum, curcumin, berberine, vitamin c, e and taking in lots of veggies and fruit, my tumor marker numbers were 54 when they first tested, a month later was 85, last week they were 22, they should be between zero and 5 in healthy people, so mine shrunk by bout 3/4ths, winning, i got a warriors heart and will go all 12 rounds if need be, ive only had 3 rounds of chemo so far, gonna do a pet scan after round 5, cant wait to see where we at, i got this, love to all in that ring fighting their asses off too
Ty GOD,TY DR.LITTLES,TY MON GENERAL🙌🙌🙌🙏☦️✝️🛐💕💌
Lost my mother on July 5 2022 to camp lejeune poison water
all the money in the world doesn't help  ( epic )  10+
I have Terminal Brain Stems Cell Cancer
The most underrated song in history.
I miss this version of Tom. Now his whole shtick is appealing to right-wing morons for clicks
You don't know what you can take, until you realize you didn't break. Masterful.
Sad thing is,THEY HAVE A CURE,IF THEY CURE US,THEY LOOSE MONEY,I HAVE STAGE 4 ADENOCARCINOMA CLL, LYMPHATIC,AND SKIN,S VERE NERVE AND HEART DAMAGE.NEVER EVER GIVE UP,LOOK UP...GOD HEARS,HEALS💪💪💪💪🙏🙏🙏✝️✝️☦️💌💌💌💌💌💌💌💌😎
Tom, I’m 100% your fan & studied molecular biology & you’re right…if you want the finer details I’d be happy to provide it…I don’t know how much $ you really got but I believe I can end it but am in fear of the government response…I debated even sending this out of fear tbh..
I think juicing marijuana raw is the cure to kill off cancer cells with sour sop and other fruits for flavor. That’s why they have made it illegal for us so big pharma can make their money off of chemo and radiation. Think about it!
The truth is beautiful therefore this song is beautiful.
We love you tom
I struggle of this song
I hope I don’t get  cancer 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶🫶😭😭😭😭😭😭

Nothing matters if you don't have your health, all the money in the world doesn't help...😢😢
So... my wife died 3 years ago from cancer. This song is so amazing, I have been listening to it from time to time. Tonight, I listened to it several times in a row. Tom Macdonald, you have a talent that I cannot explain to anyone, thank you for existing on this earth. You are helping me come to terms with her passing. I cant even think of what other nice things i would like to say to you right now. Just.... ty ty ty

sitting in room 420 at residence inn mayo in Jacksonville Florida my wife edith ellis was diagnosed with aml on  2-4-23 ,got to remission so we could get a bone marrow transplant. her Walmart insurance will only pay for mayo clinic, got down here and done another preliminary biopsy and had 18 % blast ,so now after a month of more treatment hoping for good results on 9-20- 23 in 3 days, if the bone marrow biopsy comes back good they said she could go straight to transplant they already have the donor bone marrow frozen ready to go. we could have had the transplant 45 min from home at the Greenville SC cancer center but no had to twiddle thumbs and wait weeks then leave our life in Laurens SC and drive 6 hours to be told she is not in remission now. anyone out there want to pray for Edith Ellis i would thank you Don Ellis. Tom keep Doing big things I love it, come see us in little town of Ware shoals in Laurens SC when we go home, Plenty of great areas to film and flag loving folk to help you anything you might need, Lots of areas to film that would be a blast for nova to get creative.
Ain't no use in turning on a light, I'm on the dark side of this road tonight  This ole light is about to be  diminished anyway Besides that switch is broken into so many  pieces today   I wish there was somethin' you could do or say But  words don't kill cancer anyway, from this day forward I'm' just unable to say  how i feel about all this today There  isn't much anyone  can do or  say anyway But don't think twice, it's gonna alright The sun is sinking low in this western sky just don't  let me see no  tears in them eyes keep looking above and see the smiles  I left about you everywhere   and, Don't think twice it's gonna alright Just always  remember  It's only another day turning into the night..             and know in your heart It is gonna be alright!

For all cancer patients,NEVER EVER GIVE UP💪💪💪💪💪💪🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👊💌💕👍
My dad died of cancer in 2003 at 54 and this song is home run. Keep kicking ass for all of us. I would say your the man but it takes a team to make music sound this good so you are all the man. Love you guys
THANK YOU TOM .I GOT STAGE 4 LUNG CANCER...                the news is getting better every day now. In the third round of chemo they are telling me I'm stronger than most and the cancer is reducing in size.
My mother died 2 months ago. Miss you mom
I recently found out I have colon cancer. The cancer would explain why I haven't been feeling good for quite a long time. Everyday is a struggle and I'm in pain all the time
Somehow I think they have the cure. But as always the health insurance can't make money if the cure is given. SHAMEFUL REALLY. THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR HUMANITY
Thank you for this! Survivor.
I could have used this song 4 years ago when I had cancer...yes the treatment was horrible...thanks for this song now...

RSO- Rick Simpson Oil known as Phoenix Tears. Look it up. He was jailed for it.
My husband lost his aunt, and now it's my mom💔

just found out my uncle who raised me half my life got stage 4 cancer dont know how to feel
my dad is dying of small cell lung cancer right now i wish i could take the pain for him
I just lost my little brother to cancer this year this song really gets me through it
🙏
♉ Hi I ❤️ NY ♉🍻🇺🇸🇺🇸
OMG. This is the first time hearing this song, I thought it was new. Tom you sir are truly an amazing arties, thank you.
My dad died young (late 60s) from cancer. It's scary to think i only have as long as he did. Makes me want to pursue my goals harder but struggle with people holding me back. Life's a bitch, then you die. That's been my perspective. Hopefully that changes.
Been dealing with it since Nov.2012. 5 rounds of chemo and 2 of radiation. I believe if you have enough money there is a cure for you. But if your just a lil guy like myself they keep us dragging on and on and taking our money for our co-pays. This song tells it like it is and hits home..Keep doing what your doing Tom MacDonald..
There are holistic remedy's y'all. Please research.
My mom was just diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer.
This is my 3rd time with cancer since 2021. Starting radiation soon.
It's because there's over 200 types of cancer. You can't just "cure cancer." It's not a singular thing. They're all different. Saying they're hiding a cure is acting like rich people and scientists don't also get cancer and choose money over their own lives. Makes no sense.
Today, we found out that my Mom has ovarian cancer. It hurts so bad because I can’t imagine my life without her. My heart goes out to others who have/had cancer or who have lost loved ones from it. I hate that we live in a world where they make money off of it. Stay strong y’all. ❤
I am speachless. Listened to your song the fist time. Now im sitting here and crying. Not many people speak out the truth so well like you. I cant even imagine how much this gives the people which suffered from cancer or one of their family members / friends. Thank you!
Hey, thank you for this message of strength. I’ve been battling 5 long years. Honestly lately just been feeling defeated & resigned. This song’s given me motivation & momentum to get my mind right, dig in & keep going !   Cancer is so devastating for so many families out there. My heart my love & my prayers are with you all. 🙏🏼
I'm a fighter but I'm losing my fight to cancer. I just went into hospice
CRUSHED RAW GARLIC STOPS CELLS FROM MUTATING.
I was diagnosed 2021 Aggressive radiation and chemo treatments... The fight of my life... I refused to ring the bell because there are so many who never will.... 3rd scan coming up... I'm scared. I have faith. I will fight...  My prayers for all who we've lost and for all who are living another day fighting. Don't ever give up...🙏💚
I believe there are cures but we will never get them since they make more money selling these BS treatments than really helping cancer patients.  If they give us a cure they lose money.   I have lost family and friends to cancer.  They all got worse after those so called treatments.
hes right no advancements in 50 yrs
You helped me and my mom
My mom was just diagnosed with Cancer last month, she starts treatment this week. I am 30 years old and terrified to loose my mom
Thank You, Tom!
One of my sons introduced me to Tom. It was this song. I have lost 3 family members to cance. I am a 6 year survivor. I am not a rap fan. But some of Tom's songs bring me to tears. Keep speaking for all of us.❤❤❤❤
My mom has had heart disease for 30 + years. Genetic. She has had open heart surgery, a pacemaker, etc. She just got told after her helicopter ride to the hospital that her heart is only working at  15%. There is not much more that they can do for her. She is only 63 years old. Thank you for your music. I greatly appreciate it.
Just lost my aunt to cancer. This song hits harder than ever now
There is no gene that causes cancers  absolutely no gene ( life inhanhaces  it n influnce it like smoking ciggs or breathing air, eating foods
I beat cancer a year before Tom made this song but even now I cry listening to it because a lot of good people in the treatment center never came back for another round and it hits you every time because one kid was younger than me and he never came back and he was supposed to have more treatments it hurts man cancers tough
Tough Piece ! 😭🤔🥴😱😤😡🤬☠💜🤘🍀🌠🌌🪐🌈
1 out of 2 people will get some kind of cancer in there lifetime! When will it be EVERYONE? Or is it already?
Cancer is BIG business cancer drugs are at $165 billion expected to hit $365 billion by 2030! If anyone thinks thats NORMAL you are blind!
This was a great song. I've had six family members die of cancer, including both parents. The mention of toxic environments and cigarettes hits good because my father worked with chemicals that are now known carcinogens (although there is no proof that is what caused it) and my mother died of lung cancer from smoking since she was 14.   I don't think there is a cure. Believing there is a cure requires belief in God in one form or another. Without some intelligent entity overseeing our world why would we think that cures for our diseases exist? Without such an entity nature wasn't given specific purposes. No plant or chemical was placed in nature with the purpose of healing us. Such plants may randomly evolve but the probability of that must be mindbogglingly small. So small that believing in their existence is foolish. That being said, if humanity ever does create a cure it won't be cheap to buy. Only rich people and people who have rich governments that pay the bill for them will have it.
Lost my dad 12-26-22. My world revolved around that man. Started with a melanoma tumor on his face. Went thru surgery radiation amd got to ring the bell..a yr later he was gone a week after finding out it returned and hit his bones hard. That man was my rock. He was a soldier thru it tho..maybe more stubborn but he fought a hard fight and never gave up till the ending day. Fuck cancer! Fuck your Porsche payment..let em live.
My mom and sister are both battling cancer. Thank you for this song!! They both are definitely fighters!! Sad what our world has become.
The hardest part of cancer is battling it alone.FOR MY FAMILY IN HEAVEN ALL TAKEN TOO SOON....MY FIGHT IS ALMOST DONE.SEE YOU SOON ❤❤❤🙏🙏☦️✝️✝️🇷🇺🌸💌💕
My wife of 40 years was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lymphoma and was told she had about 6 months to live without chemo. She asked what if she took the chemo, and was told maybe another 6 months. She refused all treatment and it has now been 18 months and is getting better. With prayer and healing meditation, she is beating it. Prayers help. Prayers to all those that are suffering.
I know he'll never see this but rn this song is the only thing getting me through
My ant fern dog has died and I have no idea what happened to her and I miss her so much 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭now she’s up to god 😭😭😭😭😭😭
A new song
Tom you should make another song
I commented once on this video when my mother was hopefully in remission. She lost that battle a month ago.  R.I.P mum 18.06.1958-18.06.2023
If they would let out the cure That would destroy. The depopulation agenda
Love it my brother has cancer
My aunt died to cancer but you just got to keep them in your heart
Love you Tom. I'm a survivor and a huge fan. ❤
I got told I had Testicular Cancer stage 3 on April 7 and I just lost all my hair due the chemo they say chemo working and hopefully to be cancer free on Aug 10. This song has gave me more hope to keep push through all of it
Oplopanax horidious its called devils club cause it whips the devil and any sicknesses for real tom

Never never EVER GIVE UO...WE ARE STARS💪💪💪💪🙏🙏🥰🥰💕💕☦️💜💙💯💯🛐🛐💌💌
Cancer is a curse in my family. My grandpa was in his 80s when aggressive cancer took him in less than 6 months. My 6 year old nephew died of a brain tumor. My younger sister survived leukemia and died from a UTI less than 3 years later because the chemo and radiation destroyed her immune system. A few years after she passed, her two year old granddaughter, whom she never got to meet, survived leukemia.
Im 17 now, when i was barely 14 my mom had cancer in her kidneys, and it turned to lymphoma, the hospital barely tried, at the time i didnt understand, but now i realise that the whole time she was suffering, i found this song relatively recently in comparison to the rest of toms music, but its one of my favorites bc i know what it does to peopl. My eccentric, outgoing mom, turned to being low energy unable to do the things she wanted in a matter of weeks.
Okay there is a cancer cure you just have to do it. Naturopathic you can take things, and we'll fight cancer from attaching and growing. Let alone kill the existing. Mother nature Love's mankind. If interested please ask. Google is there a smart. 💯👍 This song is so true..
Hey to. The cure is oplopanax horidious, devils club it cures all kinds of cancer its a thing to take along with diatomaceous earth and a poke root tea like a spoon at a time a table spoon along with a healthy diet it is a true thing
Still listening to this ❤❤❤❤
I almost died 3 times from the chemo and had a 13% chance of living I had to have 7 epidurals at once it was the hardest thing I have ever done and I am 13
I almost died 3 times from the chemo and had a 13% chance of living I had to have 7 epidurals at once it was the hardest thing I have ever done and I am 13
OMG I am 13 and have cancer and some side affects from the chemo and radiation that the doctor have never seen
God has many issues (among those who are not yet even SICK); I hope to come to KNOW Jesus Christ. Cancer is coming from those who are serving SATAN; They are the CANCER toward humanity.
Lost my cousin Last Friday and said goodbye on Wednesday.  #FuckCancer this song should be at a billion views.
Wow, powerful.  Lost both of my parents to cancer.  Makes me wonder if I’m next.  It’s scary - and yes - for sure they have a cure.  Problem is healthy people do t bring in the $$$$$
No one wants to leave here? I do. But not today.
Apricot seeds are known to fight cancer but they aren't telling anybody that are they sad it's all about money

I've lost three Aunt a mother and a sister to cancer it's like yesterday thank you Tom for knowing that there are people out here that needs songs like these to understand how evil these people are who are trying to kill the people off
To all the parents in these comments I am so sorry for your loss. I couldn't imagine what you all are going through
One of the most heartbreaking things my mom who was a nurse said to me when she was dying from lung cancer was “ I don’t have to be going through this. There is a cure for cancer, but it’s not profitable for the medical industry to use it. “. She passed away two weeks later.
My uncle was just diagnosed with stage 4 cancer(gave 8 weeks to live) looked up to the guy growing up now watching him disappear into a shell of who he was hurts seeing such a strong guy wither away.... Im dreading the phone call if its one of the days i cant see him  **Update as of July 16th 2023 my uncle passed away from colon cancer++  Rest easy uncle til we meet again
My husband died last year from stage 4 colo rectal cancer.  He fought so hard for 3 years.  He was my soul mate.  I am lost without him.
Lost my dad in 2020... it was one year from the diagnose till he died. He died in hospital and here in germany my husband and my daughters were not allowed to visit him for the last time because of covid. It's a crime......
Thank you Tom ! This song is helping me heal! ❤

Thank you so much for this song. My Daddy & best friend died of cancer in 2018. This song moved me to tears because it's so very true. Thank you isn't enough but THANK YOU!!
They aren’t even helping my grandma with her cancer just giving morphine 😞
I'm in remission but the cost to my insurance company to do it was almost half a million. The cost to me was 64 (the most you can get) highest dose radiation treatments in 30 days, 2 1/2 months of chemo and a years worth of immunotherapy treatments.  Absolutely no doubt it is a profit deal.
He’s having to pay 18,000 a month for a experimental drug.
Just lost my niece on the 20th (12 years old) 11 days away from 13... I miss her more than I have words for.

I do not understand how this video/song does not have a billion view.  It should be on the radio as this needs to be heard by all.  Goosebumps.  I know way to many people that have cancer.  Its not fair.
When I was seven I had eye cancer for 18 months  this song hits 💔
Tom thank you
guess who's #1 now!!
My Fiance had cancer at 18 thyroid. It has been remission ever since then after her 3rd vaccine she got sick again and developed a very rare cancer. She just spent two months in the hospital and had spinal surgery to remove the tumor. Then, 10 days before she was to come home, she found a lump on her leg. The pet scan showed it has now spread to the brain, and both lungs left leg L5 in the spine and her skin. Turns 32 june 4th. So now it's just take care of her keep her comfortable and love her as much as i can. They can't save her. We went from they expected a full recovery to she will die from this. Truly lost.  Edit- she died 6 weeks ago. RIP love 🙏
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙌🙌🙌🙌💌💌💌💌💌💌🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🩹
I just found this song! How special 🙏 You have hit home on this one Tom. Your words are so true.. I have lived with cancer my whole life but in a different way.  I lost my sister Kay she was 14 I was five in 1970. Then Doris she was 52 in 1994. My brother Monroe he was 56 in 2008. My brother Randy 62 in 2016. My hero my Daddy cancer took him at 96 years old that was 7 weeks after my brother in 2016. My life long friend and boyfriend of 7 1/2years Kurt he was 51 in 2019. My best friend Holly died April 26 2023 after a 10yr fight and she fought like hell! This is her song! I miss you sooo much Hollywood 😘  Peace love and prayers for all that have lost our loved ones  ✌❤🙏
I’m a hospice social worker and I feel this song, also having 2 major chronic illnesses that have almost killed me numerous times makes this song hit me even more.
I do not understand how this video/song does not have a billion view.  It should be on the radio as this needs to be heard by all.  Goosebumps.  I know way to many people that have cancer.  Its not fair.
I lost my dad when I was 16, he was 42,,, SO MUCH TRUTH IN THIS SONG, 🙏❤️💯
My daughter was 2 when she was diagnosed with Leukemia.  2 months later I was diagnosed with cervical cancer. I had to stop this song 3 times just to make it through. There aren't enough words to describe Tom and how amazing and empathetic he is.
Thank you for this song.
Thank you Tom. My mother has multiple myeloma and this is helpful to us that someone like you takes the time to tell the truth through their music. ❤️❤️❤️ You're the best. I'm glad you hit that number 1 on the billboard with dirty money. You deserved that spotlight a long long time ago.
I love your music ❤❤❤❤
Very nice 😂
I just lost my aunt thru Medical Assistance In Death (MAID) one of the hardest things ive gone thru. Thank you Tom. This song helps me
Lost my dad a week ago to stage 4 bone cancer. Tom, I know you probably don't read comments, but thank you for this song.
The saved go to heaven. Have hope in Jesus
this song is a Masterpice
Thanks tom. I lost all of my family besides my dad in the past 3 years.. 3 year's ago copd and smoking killed my mom.. 2 years back fwntlyn killed my middle brother. Last year my brother died in my house on his birthday from brain cancer... and my dads 75.. witch means all be alone soon.. and for a person with mental illness and no real skills besides music scares me.... but atleast ill have the music to help with the memories i guess
forever is installed in our hearts....
I had kidney cancer and it was found due to a back injury. I can't imagine all those who push through the pain and suffering of chemotherapy and painful surgeries. What makes me mad is the cancer causing products out there and the money and powerful predator ruling class elites who profit off other people's misery and them being sick. It's population control. EFF cancer EFF the predator ruling class elites
What was invented first, cancer or the hypodermic needle? Much love Tom, the honesty in your music will be forever treasured, the positive influence you are making on earth is unmeasurable.
My mom died after radiation made her back up and her intestines exploded back in oct. They had to put me on meds after that to keep me from killing myself. Cancer sucks. I miss her so much. I went through that all by myself no one was here with me but my music. That's why I say u saved and haystack, Yelawolf,kid rock, Eminem, jelly roll, and last but not least Nova the strongest woman I have seen lately. If I left anyone out my bad but let them folks know also. Thanks Tom MacDonald
1000000 TRUTH IN EVERY SONG TOM WRITES AND SINGS.   BEING 94years old next birthday.    NO MATTER CREED, RACE, ETHNIC U R. HE TELLS THE FACTUAL TRUTH. Wake up America and the world.
My wife of 27 yrs died of pancreatic cancer she fought it for over a year just to be with us. Even though the treatment was destroying here quality of life I never once heard her complain. Thanks I enjoyed the song for those that watched there love one die of Cancer it was the hardest thing I have had to deal with for those going thru it now be strong and be there for them God bless
🙏
My mom was an 8yr cancer surviver.  They took out lymp nodes, part of her brain, both her breasts, had her be the ginny pig for the chemo pill. She beat it all until the said do radiation! 15 treatments in a row which turned/burned her chest solid black. She was dead before she got thru the 15. They have a cure but Tom's right they don't want it k own. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
This song needed more love
This is my CANCER FIGHT SONG🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💪💪💯💯🙌🙌🙌🥰🥰🥰🥰💟💟💙💙❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥💌💌💌
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭no words TOMYou saved us all xxx

Sadly my partner had passed from Cancer 2 years before this video was released - she would have loved it...  It would have helped (a lot)...
This hit home, diagnosed with a rare tumor in 2020, still here, still fighting, still strong.

Avoid poisons in all ways shapes, & forms.
Should've made a comment when it happened. But my mom broke 4 ribs and punctured a lung when she fell. Then they found stage 2 cancer in her lymph nodes. She worked through chemo and radiation. To put food on the table my mom is a true fighter. But there's scars cancer leaves and it still hurts to see.
Tom❤❤❤ You are the best.❤❤❤❤😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤
Cancer is the worst I am heartbroken💔💔💔💔❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢😢😢😢

Medical marijuana kills cancer & numerous other items make tea as well... ever need help ask grate tune.
Tom, im a very long living cancer patient,  I never took chemo, or radiation,  just surgery,  I got back up and started living every time, after surgery, the cure is no sugar  no carbohydrates,  just alkaline your body I have lived 40 years from first surgery,  being 23, to now 63, don't fear it, don't let the doctors make you feel fearful,  laugh be real, and live each day like its your last one, as its not the cancer its the fear of it that stops you from owing your life and living your life to the fullest,  God bless all of our journeys.
I pray that a scientist will leak the cure!
I truly believe in my heart there’s a cure!! He’s so right on!!!!
My dad has been doing everything to survive cancer!!!
I think the government has the cure but they wanna make money off of us look at FDA they approve things that kill us faster
1:12 she might wanna put some lotion on that
That's a beautiful song goddbless
i had cancer at 2 to 4 i was told i wouldn't make it past 20 but here i am almost 20 and running strong JMML was the cancer i had good luck to everyone who struggles you are all in my prayers. and thank you tom for u songs u got me through a lot of harsh times

Tom, you and Nova are true inspirations, love you guys. Great Song!!!

Jesus has my mom and Dad sister's and brother too,  we will see each other again,....
My mom died of lung cancer
My ex who’s a huge Tom Macdonald fan lied about having lung cancer to get money out of me. My mom actually died from this terrible illness in 2015
Thank you Tom for releasing this song and video. My heart broke when my brother passed due to cancer last year. This song is inspirational, (please don’t be upset when I say this) I hope and pray you come closer to God. I have faith Jesus died for us who believe in Him. I’m not trying to offend you, because you have so much truth in your art. God loves you, your family, and Nova. God bless y’all!!!
Tom truly is a hero and inspirational motivator giving people the courage and power to fight the system and bringing us together simultaneously
God bless you for that song.
I will fist fight anyone who says Tom isn’t a modern prophet.  Read the comments of this alone and see the insight, love, and everything right about human beings in the Hang Over Gang.  So many people offering genuine prayers and compassion to random strangers brought together by this man. I’ve never felt that way about someone before, but after realizing it I refuse to believe God stopped sending his message 2 thousand years ago.  We just don’t accept it.
Third go round of chemo 😭😭😭 I've survived lung cancer and stomach cancer. Now it's in and on my spine. This go round has been so hard. This song is the song I play through my treatments.  I love your music. Thank you
Bro my mom's got plasma cell leukemia and was days away from transplant when she got COVID and now it's just been real hard. I'm gonna send this to her. I've said it before but I'll say it again. U r the fuckin man. Thanks for existing and going against the grain takin all the heat to bring the truth into the minds that thirst for it. God bless you.
I'm a Childhood Leukemia survivor and I have to say I cried listening to this. He nailed exactly how I felt. I was in a coma for five months.
Exactly they found a vaccine for lame old COVID within a few months yet can't fegure out anything more out about something that's kills more then COVID more then car crashes and murder and drug addiction combined yet they can't find a way to get rid of it. Why haven't they made a big deal like COVID and throw everything at it until they find a cure. It's because they make to much money off of it by making slow acting or even non effective drugs
Lost my father to cancer when I was 3
Lost my mother when I was 18. She seen 38 years in this world , fighting the disease for 4 of those. I remember watching her literally pulling her hair out at the dinner table , and coughing her lungs up into a bowl in the living room . Most precious person in the the world . RIP Loretta Jeannie  Rushing 12/2/93 .
Micheal Todd Payne in the ass Cooley I fucking miss you daddy
My sister is underjoining her third THIRD cancer regression. IT COST ONE MILLION DOLLARS. ONE FUCKING MILLION.
Cancer spreading TOM, BUT I THANK YOU FOR THIS ... BLESSINGS TO YOU AND NOVA.HAPPY EASTER 💕💙🙏🙏✝️
My dad has stage 4 Cancer handicap he can't stand up. Groundup case screwed him
This shit made me cry man. I love tom
Well Tom, I been holding on to this for like 30 some years, but this song hit me hard brother. I jus turned 56 March 6th,, I was 20 when my dad died of lung cancer and we were on bad terms. He was a tough Marine and I was a lil punk, addict, and my son was 3 when my dad passed,,,, On his 3rd B-day at 4:10 that afternoon on 28th of November. Been 35yrs now and if I could turn back time. Thanks brother.*DMT*#5150 (⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠) HOG🤟🌠💥
Forkover knife. I seen another common dirt look at it and try it for yourself for 6 months and I bet you see a big difference in your health. Hi guaranteed. All the biggest mammals on the planet eat plant food. And like? It or not we're part of that too. Don't dog it down till you're trying?
Ty GOD...I GOT ANOTHER DAY🙏🙏🙏🪖🪖🛐🛐✝️✝️🙌🙌💪
Of course, they have the cure! But they make more money on treatment  then they do on cures! Plus there's a dirty little secret that they what and need people dying! It's a sinister world we live In! And the people in charge are making out like Bandets while we the people suffer! They get rich off sick people!
Absolutely love this song; thank you for producing it Tom, you're an amazing artist with a true talent!! 6 years ago; my oldest brother's femur bone snapped in half, once in the hospital he was diagnosed with Stage 4 kidney cancer that metastasized to his bone marrow, he was given no more than 18 months to live and told he'll never walk again. With extreme determination; he was walking again in 6 months and is still alive fighting the battle today ❤ Never give up!!
Hit me hard, ive lost my mum & two brothers & my sister to cancer...I'm the only one left & I wonder will it get me to.
My mom just got diagnosed with two different types of cancers and is starting her first chemo treatment when the middle of next week... For everyone reading this please keep her and everyone else that has it in your prayers 🙏
St Jude's Cancer Research Hospital is free but I don't know the criteria to get in.  It's a children's cancer research hospital.  They've cured a lot of children for free.  You don't have to be a Catholic.  You just have to need cancer treatment for your child and are uninsured.  Started by the late entertainer, Danny Thomas, and is his legacy to the entire world.
Facts
I thought i was a fan and listened to all of your songs...but i have never heard this one. This one hits home as i was diagnosed with multiple myeloma May 11th 2016 and I am 30 days from possibly a cure or something that will give me more time with my family...car-t cell therapy. So far the dr's have said all my numbers are good. Only time will tell. Thank you Tom Macdonald for this song it just reminds me not to give up...thank you so much!
I was diagnosed with cancer a rare kind pv and this song sums it up
I am a cancer survivor. I’ve had 5 major strokes. Multiple heart surgeries. Now at 47 I’m a 2 years post heart transplant. This song is my life!
Cancer knows no age,no race it doe not discriminate.I KNOW,IM A FIGHTER...THIS IS A SONG TO OUTLAST TIME.FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT...IT IS GENETIC,CAUSED BY OUR GOVERNMENT.. PRAYERS, 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👩‍❤️‍👨👩‍❤️‍👨👩‍❤️‍👨🙌🙌✝️🛐👍😎💓💓💕🤱🧖

Wow! 😢
Found out yesterday,my genotype is incurable.NEVER GIVE UP.TY TOM...FOR BEING A TRUE VOICE AND SPOKESMAN FOR THOSE WHO SUFFER🤱🛐✝️🙏🙏👩‍❤️‍👨👩‍❤️‍👨👩‍❤️‍👨😊
Its funny how life works out. I used to think I didn't want to live, I used to try and find ways out. That all changed when I got married and had a kid, I love them both. I got diagnosed a year and a half ago and every day is pure struggle. But I can't give up now, there is too much at risk.
Too much money to be made in treatment of most every affliction . That's not how we expect and need it to work.
I know that look on her face all too well 😢 I went to the doctor by myself (thought it would be routine). Sitting there by myself and the doctor comes into the room... I knew by the look on his face that it was not good. I think I only actually heard "CANCER" "STAGE 3". I don't remember anything else that was said. I went blank................. My brain actually seemed like it was misfiring and couldn't comprehend what I had just heard. I could barely speak a single word. Time seemed to stop while I got dressed, gathered my things, and took the longest walk in history to the parking lot. Every step I took seemed to take me a step further from my car. I sat in my car in the parking lot for what seemed to be a lifetime, staring at the brick wall in front of me.
My grandfather was diagnosed with cancer last week, I knew exactly where to go for healing. Thank you Tom❤️‍🩹
I know where I'll go when I die 🥰🥰 & I'm READY beautiful song
❤❤❤❤❤
great work Tom!
Thank you I am in remission right now I get this song totally
Fucking hell Tom! You bring me to tears with nearly every song. It has been such a long time since I have felt so moved by music. I had given up on hip hop until I started to listen to your music.
Just love what you stand for
You are such an inspiration.  God Bless you.
My Mom just beat late stage 3 cancer and this song just hits the nail on the head
Hey Tom and Nova, my best friend passed from brain cancer after seven months of medical treatments and surgeries.  The details of her suffering were very graphic and heart breaking, but she was a brave fighter. I miss her so much..
💙
My husband passed March 16th 2022.  He had stage 4 cancer.  He fought it for 3 years as he did not want to leave us.  The treatments were awful and costly and he is gone.
Just like climate change. It is a trillion dollar industry that the left can't afford to get rid of.
So thanks 4 Being  u
My Son Carson is only 10year old and he's in remission for the 2time and he's amazing he was two years old wine his and all of are family life change I love you and your songs because I have just music to run to
My name is Justin and I’m 23 years old I was diagnosed with stage 3 brain cancer 😢and I’m currently fighting with god to kill these demons ❤I know it will get better but some days it’s hard I can’t work anymore or play football witch I loved to do I will be able to do those things again thank you god for all your blessings and what you put me through to make me a man I am today god bless everyone💙💙💙💙💙🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Praying now my TARGETED RADIATION TREATMENTS HAVE WORKED.VERY ILL.FIGHT ,THE LORD IS THERE🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🛐🛐🛐🤱
😢🐜
I'm currently going through my 3rd run in with cancer.  This time I'm doing radiation.  I'm not scared to die but I'm definitely tired of the so called "treatments" that have brought me to the absolute bottom. I'm happy I have met the people I have along the way, and this has become one of my fight songs!  I hope one day I'm well enough I can sit down and talk with Tom and make it to a live show!  ❤🎉 fight on!
Shit made me tear up man. Great song love this. Every word has never been spoke better. Thank u for ur music!!!
Lost my Dad 13 years ago to prostate cancer. He was 81 years old and accepted his fate with grace, faith, and dignity. He live a long life and accomplished so many amazing things. I  miss our conversations, although we didn't always see things the same way we always enjoyed hearing eachothers views . Miss ya Dad!
They give us cancer by poisoning our food, water, air! They want us sick!!!
So far I'm 18 months in ! So far Im in remission. March 23rd I see my oncologist 💙💙💙💙💯😿🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
They have sent  one hundred sixty billion to Ukraine while nothing is working right here
Ty ty TOM MACDONALD FOR ALL YOU DO 😊😊🙏🙏🙏✝️✝️✝️❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹🥰🥰💞💕🛐
As someone who's lost two grandparents from cancer. Thank you Tom for writing this song❤️ HangOverGang fam for life
Gosh dang this hit me hard few years ago I almost lost my father too cancer and now he’s doing just fine im so proud of him
These lyrics are so damn true! Diagnosed with breast cancer 3 days after covid hit (day after my 49th birthday), got the all clear after 9 months of chemo, surgery, and 2 months of radiation. 6 months later, diagnosed with colon cancer! The effects of all I have gone through has messed my body up. I will say having a positive attitude is the one thing that got me through it all!
You need to team with RYAN UPCHURCH..ANOTHER KING,LIKE YOU👍🤍🤍
Tom you are my hero.TY SO VERY MUCH FOR CARING ABOUT US.🕊️🕊️🧖🧖💙💙💕💕🙏🙏💪🪖
I have pancreatic cancer stage 4, stomach  cancer, an pulmonary cancer. Tumors everywhere so thank you
This is just awesome, Tom. I couldn't stop myself from tears.
This hit home, lost my Mom in 2020 due to aggressive non small cell carcinoma…. She found out in April 2020 and we lost her August 2020 2 days before my birthday….
I lost my son two weeks ago. He would have loved this song. I think it would have been his theme song, lol.
There's only two places to go when you die get right with Jesus today!!
Went to a friends memorial service today. She fought cancer for 6 years but she eventually lost the battle.  She was 58. Saw her in hospital last week. One of the most terrible heart wrenching things I've ever seen.  A beautiful lady completely destroyed by a disease.  She passed a few hours later.  F- you cancer !
6 BIOPSYS STILL CANT FIGURE IT OUT . IM NOT STUPID THE MONEY GAME !!!!
Love this song, thanks for the lyrics they mean a lot to so many. Lost my husband to cancer after day 28 from diagnosis, I miss him everyday like it happened yesterday but it will be  6 years this may. Cancer sucks
Miss you Dad...... 😔 FUCK cancer
There are cures for certain types. It's just the FDA cant make any money on it so they won't approve it
#family period!!!!
dude!!???? smh!!! i really wanna be on your crew!!!!
to anybody suffering from this, look at carnivore diet. Research dr chaffee. It has changed my life.
I am that patient.Cancer is a job...we aren't paid for..FOR ALL WHO SUFFER..I PRAY FOR YOU 💙💙💙 FOR US ALL🙏🙏🪖🥊🥊🥊🥊🔥🔥🔥🔥💜💜💜WE ARE GODS ELECT
Today (March 7th, 2023), I start my journey. I was diagnosed with melanoma on Valentines Day after my having a "shave biopsy." That is a phone call I'll never forget. All 4 sections they sent off came back positive. I've been playing the part of "Oh, it's fine. It's just a few surgeries, and it'll be okay. " That's what I tell my family, but I'm not really sure. I just don't want them to worry.  My 1st surgery will be in the next 6 hours. They say I need 4 surgeries total.   I'll admit I'm scared and I wish I knew how this was going to end. I may not know what I'll have to endure, but I promise I'll go down swinging.   So, to anyone else who might be going through something like this...DONT GIVE UP! FIGHT LIKE HELL & PLEASE KNOW, you're not alone.
They could create Covid but can’t cure cancer?  You would think big pharma would get sick from licking the cash that is six feet thick.  They cure your cancer after torture from the treatments, then apologize to your family while handing you a bill that you can never repay.  Hey government help families with medical bills rather than welcome illegals that cross our boarders with drugs that kill.  Said!
So true!
Thanks again bud 🙏 You're one of a kind.
This song hits home. I lost my great grandpa to his battle with cancer last year now days we visit my great grandma every weekend for comfort. my mom just started the acceptence part of grief last month and its been really hard with our family
my wife of 12 years just passed on december 17th 2022 from stage 4 metastatic endometrial encarcinoma  i'm 2 months in the grief stuff and your songs are so powerful and have helped me try and deal with my loss please dont stop making music. your music  is so powerful and full of truth and more people need to here it  my wife also listened and liked your tunes  thank you and don't stop doin what you do i dont know if the song "ghost" was made for this subject but it makes me think of her and makes me feel like she is still here when i hear it
Amazing 👏
Thank you your appreciated
TRUTH
Great song when you're Going through this song's writing ✍️ in it.
Thank you Tom. Just lost the love of my life. One of the hardest times, watching him fight for his life. I try not to be selfish by missing him so much, but I have a huge hole in my heart. I am happy that he isn't suffering anymore thoe. If I could just have one more day. I most certainly wouldn't take one minute with him for granted, that is for sure. God bless. Love and light.
Love Tom. I heard this song before but before I received my breast cancer diagnosis. I meet with my oncology team tomorrow to do a timeline for a port and start chemo before a double masectomy. It means something deeper now.
I'm going to cry
You nailed it
I absolutely love this song
#HOGtheARMY
When he first dropped the song a few months before it I found out the mother of my kids had stage 4 metastatic incurable cancer...today on 2/25/23 at the age of 32 she lost her battle. This song amongst others of Tom's is close to me but this means the most. Thank you Tom for this song it came at a great time in my life.
He's the best artist alive and he reminds me how great my recovery in my life is!!!💜💜 Love you Tom and Nova
My husband beat cancer (so far), but.. the treatment left him a different person. My heart breaks every day for him.
Simply edited and to the point don't know anybody that hasn't been affected or known someone that has had cancer we have lost several family members in a short space of time but also have survivor's so have seen both sides just have to keep fighting
My uncle died a couple years ago from cancer and my aunt just died yesterday
Real song real sh#t ugh Fu#king cancer took both my parents, everything in this song is REAL even the depression an crying from it😔
Thank you Tom! Keep it real for the unreal may wake up! Teach by doing!! Keep doing you! And they will learn!!
I was shot in the head and also got cancer and a brain aneurysm and I'm fighting but seems I may loose the fight at 40 yrs old with 4 kids and a grand baby on the way
I had leukemia 18 years ago. I was 19 when I was diagnosed and they didn’t tell me that the truth of how aggressive it was and I only had a 38% chance of surviving. I had 3 year of chemo and radiation. A year of heavy intense chemo. I lost my ability to walk and had to relearn how to. I got all the rare side effects. I still suffer today. I’m just happy I’m alive. I’m 37 now and have 3 beautiful daughters after being told I would not be able to have children. I’m unfortunately on a lot of medication just so I can walk and not be in so much pain. I am trying my best to help all those who get diagnosed with leukemia that you will be ok. It maybe rough but be positive and smile you’ll get through it. Thank you for this song.
I’m posting this track on every cancer research on Instagram an Facebook lol it’s all a scam an people need to listen to this track 😂❤
I'm about to breakup with my girlfriend, cause her father and brother died because of cancer
Thank You and your lady for this song!
My dad got cancer in 2004 in 2017 he lost his battle with cancer
💚💚💚
Fighting cancer for the 2nd time, leukemia I'm coming for you and I'll beat you! 💪 Secret is positive vibes only (even it's not easy)
Honestly..... fuck chemo.  My mom was diagnosed with Leukemia and she got one Stem Cell Transplant and it worked for one year.  Then she came back and she was just ask sick and she died a couple of months later.  Part of me wishes chemotherapy wasn't something they offered to people because I think she would have lived longer.
Complete metabolic remission !!!  Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart  I WIN...
I have lived thur 3 cancer treatments. With the love of God and my husband. No one should live thru this alone. I pray for all those living  with this challenge. GOD bless us all
I don't like this song I fucking love it and I think Tom Mcdonald is amazing man
Autophagy is the cure .It's not advertised because no one profits from it.
You’re right! There is a cure! Such true words….
Tom,you are BEAUTIFUL ❤️,my hero.LOVE AND PRAYERS FOR YOU AND NOVA.
Truth set Free
Thank you Tom!! I went through chemo and radiation it was tough but I kicked it’s ass!! Thank you for caring!!! Love 💕 to you!!!!!😊
tell me a single well known politician that died of cancer...ill keep waiting...
Lost my dad 6 years ago from cancer.  He fought hard but in the end,it got him. This song hits home. My dad didn't listen to rap music, but I'm sure he would like this song.  Hope to see another song like this from you.  Keep it up!
I showed this to a friend who survived chemo - she thought it was corny/cliché. Made me realise I'll never understand what its like to hear/feel this from the other side...yet.  Respect for the intention, it deserves a bow. Beautiful song of acknowledgement either way. A smij conspiratorial at the beginning.
The day this song was released, I found out my mom had lung and brain cancer. I wish I could tell you that she fought hard and beat it. The treatment killed her. She lived a tough life and i think she just gave up inside. Without the desire to live on she didn’t stand a chance. On April 20th of 2021 she let out her last breath. 13 months later almost to the day (5/19/22) my dad died as a result of a car accident. Add in a pandemic, being homeless and the woman I loved walking out of my life, I’ve had a rough couple of years here. Did I mention I’m a recovering alcoholic and heroin addict. 6/9/17 I made a decision to stop living in hell and through everything I mentioned above, managed to stay clean and sober. I woke up clean and sober today. In conclusion to all this I have to say, Thank you Tom. Thank you for making a soundtrack that seems to perfectly fit my life and how I see a lot of things . I admire you for your unbelievable talent and to be able to do it all without the BS of the mainstream. Thank you for being the voice that is heard worldwide portraying the messages that I personally stand behind. Thank you Tom MacDonald for being….YOU. Peace bro✌️🙂
Ty,ty,ty,MON GENERAL AND WVU RADIATION ONCOLOGY,TY GOD
Ty TOM MCDONALD,NOVA ROCKAFELLER....TY LOZA,TY NUBREED,TY RYAN UPCHURCH...I RANG THAT BELL TODAY U SAVED MY LIFE..AND GOD.. PRAYERS FOR US ALL
they gotta keep us sick so their billions keep rollin in......so fuged up
Why treat someone in a day when they can make money off that person every day they struggle to survive 😢😣😖🤬
ℹ absolutely love this song and love @TomMacDonald and Nova. My husband has cancer and on Jan 5th 2023 we found out that he has a brain 🧠 tumor which makes him terminal. I’m going out of my mind at the thought of losing my best friend. I just found him after one failed marriage of 16 yrs and have been with Jim for 13 yrs now. He’s too young and I’m not ready to be a widow or alone. I ask God daily to help cure my Jim. I have almost all of Toms songs and will be adding this one to my play list. ❤ thank you Tom for all your hard work and sharing it with the world. God bless you. 🕊️
I've said this same comment on other tracks and I'll say the same once again, I only stumbled across TOM on TikTok and it's the best thing I've come across on there. He is a fucking legend 🤙🤙🤙
My nephew just was diagnosed today and I heard about his sickness the first time I heard this I think it was weird and it makes me heartfelt
FEBRUARY 4, 2023 TOM, I AM STILL HERE, STILL STRONG AND STILL THANKING MY FAMILY FOR BEING BY MY SIDE.
We are not afraid
this is so good... no other words.
We are GODS CHOSEN .FOR ALL SUFFERING AS I.. 🙏 AND ALL OF MY 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕😘😘😘
It’s so funny to me that people affiliate you with everything that’s wrong about white america. You are just a common sense guy who says it how it is. Keep on keeping on Tom, I’m off to the HOG site to get me some of your bag ass beanies. 🙏🚀🥧
My last RODEO ADENOCARCINOMA...GOD HAS THIS.. 🙏🤲🙏🙏 TO ALL WARRIORS...OUR GOVERNMENT DID THIS.TY TOM MACDONALD...THIS HITS HARD.. 💕💕💕💕
I know this will be my end. It was my Dad and my Granmaw's end. If I could spare just one child.. I would.
My parents are both survivors. My favorite aunt had both her breasts removed and still died. It's hard to believe a cure for cancer doesn't exist but it's more profitable to sell long term treatments that may or may not cure.
Just got the news today I have breast cancer, iv lost family members to different types of cancer an had some make it threw it, just scared idk what's gonna happen next. I listened to this song alot after loosing my uncle to cancer in 2021.
awsome song tearjerker
#Tommacdonald this has to be my favorite yet bro we remember yall from before the before too u were awesome then and now ,love it
Every time I think he can’t make another song like the one before I find a gem like this. STAY BLESSED TOM! Keep spreading your wisdom through music.
My wife was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in January 2021. This song helped her get through chemo and radiation. She is now cancer free. She is a Survivor! Tom your music is an inspiration to so many people. Thank you and Nova for everything!!!
My daughter had a spot on her head if I wasn't on the doctor about it she may not of been here she was in high school. They cut it out and she's 28 now and all is good
I lost my dad in 2007 to lung cancer. He was 57. I am now taking care of my mother who is now dying of cancer. I pray that I am strong enough to endure most days. Beautiful song. It touched my soul.
Thanks
Asking prayers for LOZA ALEXANDER..LEUKEMIA
Tom don't feel bad for the low amount of views on this song , I used this to get through when my daughter was at sick kids having heart surgery and now I try to not think about it and this song reminds me of it , I assume that's why people listen to it then stop ,
Just found out my wife has cancer. This song means a lot to me
Stay strong keep going....
Our Health care system is all about money! Bottom line, it's not about helping  people. Worked in health care over 30 years. Our health care system is decling and has become sub standard. There are very few healthcare professional that truly care and many have poor assessment skills. In addition, there is a lack of preventative care and patient education in many instances. It is heartbreaking and very frustrating when you get caught up in a cold, insesative healthcare system in your time of need.  Do your best to take care of yourself and try to stay healthy.
Fenbendazole
My dad lost his battle in 2021 to An EXTREMELY aggressive High Grade Neuroendocrine carcinoma. I fully believe it was related to his Agent Orange (a neuroendocrine disrupter) or Camp Lejeune exposure......but good luck getting the Government to admit it! Now his kids and grandkids are living with diseases caused by his exposure and dealing with the trauma of watching his suffering and now living life without him!
Im anxiously waiting for ultra sound of my thyroid, to see if it is cancer...
They've had the cure but only the rich need to apply
Amazing song! Thank you!
As much as I don't agree with the first verse, this song is powerful. Prayers to all of those who are suffering from cancer.
my wife passed from aml.it taken her fast, 2 weeks fast. it showed no mercy it's been over a month now and I'm having a hard time dealing with it. I do believe I will see her again after this life.
Beautiful
Yes he is
I wanted to say this song really hits home, I recently finished my chemo and I am in remission and every day I would listen to this song I love it. it really helped me get through everything
My Dad died of Cancer, Aunt died of Cancer. My Dad wasn't a great person when I was younger but he was still my Dad and it nearly killed me back then when he passed because I was trying to build that father son relationship that we never had growing up.
Look outside big pharma and chemo and radiation as they want us to stay sick! Look at the food- toxins- products we put on our bodies- start by growing you own fruit and vegetables and raising your own animals for food.  We can't allow the government to poison any longer
Cancer is the reaction of a singular gene becoming dominant in a multi cellular system caused by spreading of blood vessels.    Chemo kills everything except the cells we need to fight the most..
Very very good song Tom!!!
It's sad to think that after so many years of research all we still do for a cure is cut, burn and poison.  It does make you wonder...?...
just freakin' powerful....
Im fighting my brother 8 years surviving 7 years scared and lost yet I fight for those that can no longer!!
Six months after my father passed from cancer, I was diagnosed.  I ended up with chemo induced cardiomyopathy in my second round and almost died from heart failure, I was drowning in the fluid my failing heart caused to fill my lungs.  I'm in remission now but my heart is still damaged.  Now my father-in-law is going through the same cancer I had.
Brain cancer here, moving along… song is terrific!!!😎💪✌️
Great song
Lost my dad to cancer when I was 12. He was given 6 months but lasted 3 years. My mum 6 months later also cancer. She had been diagnosed when I was 8 and went in and out of remission 3 times. The word fills me with rage and fear.
2 of my family members currently have cancer one stage 4 one stage 3 fucking needed this shit
Always remember that there is SOMETHING AFTER THIS TOM!!! Keep Jesus in your heart!!! We'll talk about it when Jesus Christ gets here...👍🏼🙏🏻😎
How do you keep fighting when your Dr tell you that you have no chance and your insurance doesn't want to pay for treatment
I used to think Billy Joel was the greatest songwriter of my generation,but now I know it’s Tom MacDonald.
I had a "First of it's kind" type of spinal cord and brainstem cancer. They are calling it my "secondary cancer." Meaning I have another form in my body. They don't know the primary source though! They had to completely cut out all of my neck bone to open my spinal cord and cut out the tumor. I was dying  and it had to be an emergency surgery! Now I'm practically "disabled!" Constantly in chronic pain! The price we pay just to stay a live a little longer! This song helps me and touches me in a way that I can't describe! Thank you for always being my voice! I wanted to k*ll myself because of it for years! But your music has always saved me! Thank you!
when tom doesn't play the white oppressed skit he's pretty good.
🌹💞🌹💞😇
Great song . We have lost a close member of the family on my wife’s side  to cancer very suddenly!
Never give up.. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏!!! And please ,avoid narcotics
My mom has battled thyroid, breast, lung and now cancer in her foot. She is the rock that holds our family together.
💚💙💜🎼🎶🤘🥀🇺🇲
Please if you suffer from cancer, look up information about essiace tea. It can be a cure for you. Hope all the good people get better soon. What a great artist is Tom!
My sons seven and was dignose with cancer in augs of 2022 this song made me cry thinking about what he goes through everyday
W o w 💜👌👏
Cancer… is linked to mycotoxins released by toxic mold from water damaged buildings!! The National Institute recently released a study …”Aflatoxin linked to CancerS” Aflatoxin is a mycotoxin released by the mold Aspergillus fumigatus commonly found in water damaged buildings! Aspergillus fumigatus is also linked to Leukemia, Mast Cell, MS, testosterone and estrogen problems, endometriosis, Autism, mental disorders and a lot more!!! It’s been used to fuel the Sick Care Model health systems that generate astronomical profits for the Few at the expense of the masses. Getting people well doesn’t fit that narrative!! It’s all in peer reviewed scientific medical research that dates back Decades!! 🤨 I lost my family to Fungal bronchiole pneumonia Aspergillosis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus… all fungal testing was Negative, yet it’s confirmed on the autopsies!! That’s what happens when the Bible goes ignored by evil. See Leviticus! God help us all. 🙏🏼😇💫💖
Tom I respect this song a lot, like a lot of people I’m going through cancer myself. I have stage 3 small cell lung cancer, the treatments have knocked me down hard, but I’m a fighter for myself and for others that still need me. Just wanted to say thank you for music it has helped me a lot during this time in my life.
Now chemo,4cycles,3weeks apart, I'm still standing strong,weak now but will regroup after it's done.God blessed the ones survive.
And just like that I’ve lost someone else close to cancer! 😩
I used to be a talent scout for a hip hop record label out of Cleveland in my younger years If I ever discovered this cat I would be mad proud He's mad talented and I love literally every sound that he is making because I have an ear for music that's why I used to be in the music industry cuz I had an ear for it This kid is fucking amazing! Self-made, mad respect best artist on the internet right now!!!!
I received my first tattoo today...targeted RADIATION..FOR THE MEN WHO HAVE  KEPT ME ALIVE..GOD AND DR.LITTLES..MON GENERAL AND DR.ANUP DAZ.MUCH 💕💕💕 THANKS 🙏🙏🙏and the beautiful staff at Mary BABB RANDOLPH CANCER CENTER..
I MISS YOU MOTHER....SEE YA SOON !!!
I would rather have 6 good months, enjoying my loved ones. Say all that needs to be said, than 2-3-4 years, sick as h+++. I watch my fostermom, die slowly being really sick.  Never ever for me.
This man should be in the news every day and in every school or the office. The system we have is really is done us all now.
In just a couple of weeks it will be one year without my grandmother. She fought cancer for 5 years….
Hi Tom my father was just diagnosed with liver cancer it spread to his kidneys and his colon my father scared and I’m scared that he won’t be here  to make sure he’s ok while I’m getting ready  to head out the door for my deployment
Best song ever! So emotional so raw. King Tom❤
Love this song
My fellow Canadian, your f&@king amazing.  Your lyrical talent combined with your wife’s ability to bring your songs passion and topic to life through video is truly profound.  I’m 25 in a 60 yr body… I hope you shake both you hands someday.  Finally an artist that expresses reality unfiltered.  Bravo!
Amazing.
Love you man this is excellent
God Bless You Tom 🙏👍
Just discovered this artist about a week ago, Tom made a 63 year old man cry. This guy and Nova are special.
Love you Tom and nova, you two the best! Love the new song Ghost.  You’re songs and Jesus have absolutely carried me through the overdose death of my brother a few months ago. Even played a few at his funeral. Thank you.
👻♥️🙏✌️👻☝️🥳☝️
My sister. Died at 20 with colon cancer.  She was my best friend.  An now I stay lost. I rap myself around drugs.  It's so hard losing your best friend.
As a survivor I can appreciate this song so much. Absolutely fact. It was posted right when I started treatment. I know first hand just how true your words are.... You have come a long way. Proud of you
You are the best
🙏🙏🙌 I lost my mom 7 years ago to brain cancer.. 😭😭  and the horrible shit she had to in counter and go through as we all watched the Chemo kill her other word for chemo( kill me now ) and couldn't do anything about it.. and watching my mom lay there as I tried to say I love you mom for the last time all she could do was mumble and I know she was trying to tell me she loved me  but couldn't
You can feel the passion through your music; it makes my heart so happy to see you making it with the support of your family
I survive in 2016 fuck Cancer..
Yes I am
Thank you!!!  Just lost my leg and trying hard to keep the other one. My sister is fighting cancer too. This song is such a gift to us. Thank you!!
We're just here
My grandmother found out she has lung cancer over a year ago now she refused chemotherapy i enjoy the time i have left with her it makes me sad knowing shes dying of cancer and theres nothing i can do but be by her side i love her she raised me and my sister since we where babies im not ready to loss her
I have glioblastoma stage 4. Brain cancer is hard but stay strong this is your job with the treatment. Sad days happy days. Want to be free again 3 moths left of chemotherapy. Watch me live against the odds just like all of you. Tom the hero deserves the fame.
U seriously couldn't say it more better, tom.
Oh Tom, Jesus is speaking thru you. Unbelievable poetry. (~):}
I love you Tom! You are a legend
Wow. This one should be number one. By far the best yet. God bless your heart today
You truly are a gift to our lives. Thank you for being you, authentic and full of passion.  I have just finished 8 Chemotherapy and 35 Radiation Treatments for stage 3 head and neck cancer. My PET Scan is clear for me to being cancer free. So grateful. Your song will not only bring comfort but support for those supporting us wth cancer. So grateful. Thank you so much. Your talent is amazing for writing, producing and performing your music. Keep up the great work and all the best to you and your health, and may you remember you matter too in this world. MK - Australia
Last year I completed surgery, chemo, radiation. Every year I have to go and get screened and the fear never goes away. its very scary and emotional. Thank you for this song...thank you. 🙏
Truth from Swifty, paramedics know
In 2018 I was diagnosed with Breast cancer. I had a bilateral mastectomy; this April will make my 5 years.  Feb 2021 I was in a hospital room with my baby brother when he was told that he had stage four Colon cancer. The surgeon said that all of his siblings need to have a colonoscopy on a regular basis...so I did.  October of that year I had 12 inches of my colon removed, because I too had colon cancer. I owe my life to my baby brother, who lost his battle.  This song hit home like a ton of bricks. I have done away with costly traditional medicine and turned to healthy living and diet. Thank you, Tom.
This is such a powerful song and powerful video , my Dad died of cancer a few years ago before this came out and this hits me everytime I listen to it , thank you Tom ❤❤
Countless truths here. My wife is fighting s4 BC. What a horrible horrible disease cancer is. My prayers go out to everyone fighting!
Mom has Cancer so thank you for making this song. So so so much!! Love u Tom ms FAMILY
Watched loved ones leave us early because of cancer...this song is for EVERYONE effected by cancer. Last person I lost to it was the best man I've ever known (my stepdad) and boy did he shine the whole fight. He's around occasionally but he's definitely dancing in our creators light now. This songs my jam!!!
I just lost my dad back in October to leukemia. And this song reminds me of my dad and how he fought to stay with us. He never once gave up until the end. Love and respect you man keep up the good work.
Yes Tom..they've had the cure for cancer for close to a century now, but that would kill the profits so it's obviously concealed. Just about common knowledge now in 2023 I would hope.
Wow!  True.  I am now a survivor yet I'm left with a debilitating muscle disease caused by treatment.
Every single word is so true
Please play this when my fight ends..at my funeral.Ty GOD...ONE MORE DAY.TY FOR MY CHIS...TY FOR THE PAIN
My 17 year old nephew got his 1st chemo today 😔, hang in there Bradly💪love you 💯❤
Love you Tom...cancer survivor now 3 years, keep speaking truth please...no one says it but you...Good Bless
Cancer in itself is a job,a nasty one we don't get paid for.FOR ALL THOSE BATTLING THIS..MY HEART BLEEDS FOR...NEVER GIVE UP.... 🙏
For the MEN WHO PROLONGED MY LIFE..DR.LITTLES AND ANUP DAZ...I LOVE U BOTH.TY MON GENERAL

This Song Is Beautiful, Brilliant, a Light in the Dark. 🙏❤💯💯
My mom had a rare disease called vhl aka von hippel lindau. These tumors that can be in the blood stream,  the retinas of the eyes, brain, kidney just to name a few. My mom lost her eye due to the tumors, lost sight in the other one. Late tumors In her kidneys turned in to cancer.  She survived 15 years with just 1/3 of a kidney., about a year before she passed she was put on dialysis. She had so many health issues.. She developed gangrene in her feet and toes so quickly. She was a tiny lady. She wouldn't of survived the surgery. She/we made a decision to stop her dialysis treatments. They found multiple tumors all over different parts of her body. The disease was killing her but the gangrene got to her first. My momma was so tough, stubborn but loving and caring. This song means so much to me. R.I.P momma ❤
Its been a year tomrrow that my aunt has been gone from a hard, long, and painful battle with cancer... she fought hard ... I'm sorry you lost the battle Bonnie, but you never gave up.. I love you ❤️ and miss you 😔
My dad , my aunt  ,and  several  other  family  members
Son, I am not a doctor because when I was premed I worked as a CNA in oncology .... and a genetics lab ... this song ... yeah
Bless all that are Fighting  FIGHT
check: Dr. med. Ryke Geerd Hamer on your own
The CURE IS VITAMIN B17 and I can attest to that , In Gods creation are cures for everything Leatrile is the crystalized form is available from apricotpower and IT WORKS !!
targeted alpha therapy is cool, getting a steady source for alpha emmiters will be more simple when molten salt reactors become more prevalent. currently only 2 clinics in the world I think, one in bejing, one in new york.
I lost my mom to cancer in 1989. She was diagnosed on Saturday and died two days later, on Monday. We ae still shocked and all still grieve for her. Our dad passed two years ago, around the same time this song was released. I just couldn't watch it.  It's the only video of Tom's I've not watched. Until today. If you wonder how I am doing, I am sitting here, bawling my eyes out. And for the first time in a long while, I'm not trying to hold it together for anyone, including myself. I didn't know how badly I needed to let go and cry. Our hearts will always be broken.
I love you Man!
Yo never fail to pull at my emotions . This song is so powerful.
The truth does HURT. ❤️☝️🙏
Damn still can’t watch this without crying. Every single word in this song is true. Cancer is terrifying and no one can ever actually know what someone with cancer is feeling and going threw. It’s such a heavy weight you feel it in every fiber of your being. It’s even harder when you have to carry it alone. I have so much respect for those who keep fighting and getting up every day to face this plague head on.
Lot of love ❤️
🙏💪💛
This hits home for me I'm crying but it also helps me thank you
11/12/22.... Lost my momma to cancer, after she beat it earlier this year.  Heard this song over a year ago, and for what ever reason, I'm listening to it again. Miss you mom.... alot.
r.i.p love you dad.   courage has nothing to do the hair on our heads , true courage comes from with in . fight the good fight never give up, never give in,  never stop loving, that is how we win!
IM SORRY, MY PRAYERS FOR ALL WHO LOST  SOMEONE TO cancer  I DID TOO I KNOW THE HEARTACHE....  OUR LOVED ONES ARE Test subjects I found out too late my sister was right the establishmnt beter be dismntld now....
FAITH IN GOD WILL PULL US THROUGH!....WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING BUT DO THEY???
I was recently diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic cancer that started on the Bile Duct to from my liver and spread. This song should be more than just a song. It should be an anthem for those going through the struggles of cancer. Thank you for your music #HOG
see you admit it, you don't know where you'll go when you die. and you call other people dumb..............
Thank you! I’m an almost 5 year breast cancer survivor… and I’m 35! Never thought I would of fought that fight. But I did! God and music helped me through it all! So again… thank YOU!
Thanks Tom I know where I'm going.  You do too. In your heart,  lies the answer.  GOD has touched you.  You have power in your soul to save us by reminding us what HE CAN DO.   FAITH IS A WONDEROUS. THING.
https://youtube.com/@bigcolmusic8002
I just found out that I have leukemia so thank you for writing this song. Don't know how I'm going to get through it
What an absolutely beautiful song
I love tom he's got some good raps a lot of the times but I can't stand any of these hooks that he puts in the songs.they're too soft and poppy sounding
Well I still here,lost 1thd.of my left lung gone, they got it all they say, four weeks of recovery, lucky this time,you don't believe in God, you should,he kept me going against all odds.Glory to the King Almighty God.
Love ya Tom but I know where I’m going when I die
The cure is so cheap and simple anyone can do it. They dont want you to know. Dr. Linus Pauling discovered it in the 60's. Even won a Nobel Prize. Here it is. 35,000 to 100,000 mg of vitamin C (with Rose Hips) daily. Divided up and taken in smaller doses every 2 to 3 hours because your body doesn't store it. (Do you can't overdose on it)  Results in 1 month!  If you get loose stools take less. But 35 thousand minimum. Now you know. But because everyone has been lied to, it's just too unbelievable to try it, even for those with nothing left, not even time. What a shame.
Omg! You are awesome Tom! Keep up the good work.  Came across your music today and you’ve gained another fan. So refreshing to hear music with a message!
By speaking the truth who knows how many lives you can change ❤😊
My mom die of lung cancer love this song rest in peace mom think about you all the time you did great job you would be proud of me
12/22 GREAT TOM....as always.......
i love this song
My dad died from cancer and it all started with my 4 year old daughter she got cancer last year in April and my dad passed away from cancer in April
Taking my last round of chemo now. Incurable brain cancer. They give me 5 years tops. I am the only parent to 2 small kids. I try to stay strong for them. This song makes me cry every time.
Now what's really f***** up is Roundup causes Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma but they take Roundup to kill weeds and spray it all over the soybeans all over the corn you eat pretty much any plant that we consume is covered with Roundup and Roundup is known to cause cancer
Team TOM
I'm battling stage 4 colon cancer and it's spread. Please keep me in your prayers !!!!!!
3.8 my ass Dec 16 2022
I love you Tom Macdonald i am your biggest fan ever
i wish some one would make an 4d or 8d audio version of this.
Tom it's amazing that I can listen to every one of your songs and know that every word you speak is true and really from the heart. I can listen to Cancer and see good and evil in this world at the same time. Then I can go listen to Sheeple and The System and see how messed up the world really is and people are too stupid to see it! I hope that someday everyone in the world can hear you music and get the real message man! You are the best rapper ever man! Keep going!
you just mad me cry. .....❤
Respect, Tom. Deepest respect for that.
@TomMacDonald found out last night my mother in law may have cancer again after having beaten is 26 years ago. It's no coincidence I found this song the morning after. Thank you for making this song it may be your very best one.
after 4 months and a hospital stay for 5 days , the 20th i get a cryoablasion . what if it spread ? i am scared . i do believe there is a cure but they want to cut the population .
Keep your bodies pH in-line with the pH of Your Blood!!! Proven in 1951 by Dr. Johanna Budwig!!!
i still remember when i was 18 my dad told me he had cancer an given 6 months  here i am 50 and he just passed in jan 2022 you gotta know there is something worth fighting for out there
Absolutely amazing 👏 love it
This song make me cry ,  beautiful song 😘👍, Tom you are the best songwrither in Years, love from Holland
Just lost mum to it last week after a long hard fight 🙏
True and then they tell you to take your family member home to die.
This hit home... i am whats called a survivor. My body after treatments is damaged and i have so many strange side effects but i still feel so blessed to be here. I love my wife and sons and the struggles by far out weigh my pains. Thank you Tom for thinking of the people this demon has attacked... and may all of you that has been down this road ( you know what I am talking about) I wish  god to touch and take your pains away and that you live with a smile even through the pains. 🥴💖🙏💪🌝❤
I have been listening to your songs for about a year now and never heard of this song… just listened to it and I love it…. Love your music tom… you are the best!!! 🎉
Much respect to you too great work you put a tear in a 63 year old man's much respect don't let nobody hold you guys down keep up the great work ✌️❤️
Tom, you are so awesome!! You speak the truth and I love it! Keep doing what you are doing!! ❤️
My dad just died of bile duct cancer.  Ultimately it killed my mom indirectly since she died 7 weeks later. They were married for 60 years. Couldn't go on without him I guess.
Thank you Tom.  I will fight with all I got
Shed a tear for my Grandfather OSCAR GUERRA (EL REY) ....Great 🎶 Tom The Message Is clear you're the voice thank you❗💯✌
Tom your songs are an inspiration. They give me hope for our country. I stumbled across this song. I didn't think I could like your music anymore but damn I've been fighting cancer since I was 12 years old and the day suck in the nights are long very long. I don't know what made you put out a song like this but I'm glad you did. Take care watch yourself I love you brother
Cancer survivor here. Only way i made it was a "experimental" treatment(it used my stem cells). That could only be done in two locations here in the USA. This was 10 years ago or so. The sad part is this treatment was done in other countries almost ten years before the "experimental" treatment I received in usa.
My brother passed away 25 yrs ago. Went through 2 rounds of chemo and Radiation and it still got him. He was my best friend. Living life with out him has been so hard.
I lost my mom to cancer at 14. #fukcancer
I hope  technoblade heard this song before he passed r.I.p techno and to anyone who has passed from cancer and my condolences go out to all there families🕊️🖤.And those that are fighting,kick cancer in its ass
Currently going through lung cancer it’s hard thank you Tom for this and raising awareness
My soul says thankyou and it sends you and your loved ones unconditional love and all good things. Keep at it team Tom. We see the light in your eyes and hear it in your voice and you are a worthy wordsmith.🎵🎶.
DOES ANYONE SEE MY PIST OR AM I BEING SHADOW BANNED?? PLEASE REPLY  There are natural cures for cancer, BUT you can't get a patent for something that comes from nature.  NO PATENT- NO PROFITS Chemo makes doctors and drug companies  HUGE PROFITS!! Why do you think the medical complex outlawed anything that they can't make money from??
Man that song is so true
Thank you Tom this song means the world to me 🤙🤙🤙🫁
Just started my chemo again. Was diagnosed with brain cancer at 39 and given 6 weeks to live...almost 2 years ago. Positive attitude and cannabis oil have kept me going. Thank you for this song. It means a lot
Thank you for always being real!
Omg Tom. What are ya doin to me? I just found out I'm in stage 4 liver fibrosis. I find out in 2 days if it's  cirrhosis/cancer. I haven't  even told my family yet.
Thank you for keeping me strong
WOW HOW DAMN TRUE SO MANY LOVED ONES HAVE PASSED TOTHE CANCER MONSTER.  I LOST MY HUSBAND TO THAT SHIT..SO MUCH RESPECT TO TOM MCDONALD.. I LOVE YOU BROTHER
All of the stuff they said about me is bs. I even lack the Constitution for suicide
Yes, I agree - L IVING LEGEND!!!
Best video EVER!!! I get strength and courage and TRUTH most important, HOPE - there's ALWAYS hope!!!
Those of us who stay true to ourselves, our beliefs, standards and shit we will never back down from no matter how easy it seems at the time will go somewhere awesome. I don't think it's heaven because I am not baptized and I've seen where I will get to go but it's a cool afterlife none the leas
All this. All day. I had cancer in 2017 and beat it. Almost certain its back but can't afford insurance. The system is set up to kill me.
Absolute Truth - no profit in a cure
It's hard to explain. Cancer, Coke, pills, beer, ... been there done that. Best parents ever but still fucked it all up and try every day to help others.   By far the best song you've ever written  with 2nd being angels and demons. Sorry to spoil.
We are a fighter just like you.
Why did the comments disappear? The views? Where are mine?
Its like they say, theres no money in a cure. They see Cancer and other diseases as businesses, why sell ONE cure when you can sell a thousand "treatments"? They want to treat illnesses as a "subscription service to keep living".
Tom, This song has hit me so much harder lately. I was diagnosed with Leukemia in March 2022 and still fighting till this day. When im struggling i put this song on and it carries me through. From the bottom of my heart..  Thank you Tom!
Dad passed 1th of October 2022. I know where he is, the Father in Heaven called him home after fighting cancer for over 15 years. I thank the father for calling my dad home.
True! When will the parasitic greed end.
Solid truth in this
Cancer hits you hard, you dont believe youll get it untill... you get it.
Tom MacDonald You & your crew & handful of other young hard working deckhands I have met in the last few years have restored my faith in humanity after many very dark years.  Not only are you brilliant @Tom MacDonald but you did this all as an independent artist (Along with Nova & your crew) Congrats on 1B views on yt & on being #1 on billboard! Peace brother! #hangovergang4ever #hangovergangforever
There’s been a cure for cancer one of the parts needed to make it one method is a flower extract from it. Don’t remember it man that was helping people in my town in my mom’s childhood was chased out for how much it was costing the hospital. Yes the treatment keep has a 50/50 it’s not meant to cure entirely just to drain money with a high enough cure chance to keep people from pushing against pharma to actually develop a cure. Iv lost people to it grandfather who begged for us to kill him from the pain before passing in his sleep. Father figure kemo he got good health then 360 right into death. Few family friends that helped me and my mom. My grandmother now. With how high of a chance and track record has for my family won  the surprised if I end up getting some form of cancer before I die. I say the top half in earnest. Er just to help those out cannabis when it’s pure no synthetic does in fact help kill cancer in it’s early stages please remember that rather then trusting a government entirely that sees everyone as cattle period
Give All Honour to God and Focus on Jesus Christ!
4 percent fat cottage cheese without synth A, ground flax seeds, 100 percent orange juice 100 percent food natural spring water, black cherries pomegranates  Dump synthetics
This is beautiful my dad had cancer so it's close to home
Bitter truth the system is making us sufferer and killing us
AMEN✝🛐🕊🙏🙌😌❤❤❤❤
This song is so beautiful it hits my heart, recently lost my aunt to cancer. She stepped into the position of my mom and dad after they passed. I’m 35 and only have a grandma left and this song is keeping me going this thanksgiving alone and full of pain. Bless you brother
I know this will get lost since the video is 2 years old. Tom, I found your music a few weeks ago and I’m hooked!!! The topics to speak about hit me.. but this video…. I don’t know what to say, I’m a 38 year old man and there’s tears pouring down my face as I type this. You truly are talented!! Never give up brother. You have huge support of many of us, keep doing what you do.
You have the biggest heart Much admired  Much loved  Thank you for you
He's got a soft heart...but I guarantee he would knock anyone of these so called punk ass gangster rappers out!!
My girlfriend Jennifer Gulizio always tells you to marry Nova and she'll make your beautiful wedding cake 🍰 trust me after se had a double mastectomy she's gone through hell and back. Tom 🙏🏼 And Nova you guy's and your family have kept her going...God Bless You All 🙏🏼🙏🏼Thank You
Tom I need to tell you that we have needed you for decades now and I am so thankful the truth to our world is being spoke!. God sent you to us 🙏
My dads just found out he’s got can set it has t sunk in yet  he’s starting radiotherapy soon .
I watched my mother lose her sister and BFF 16 months ago. I'm still mourning....
As I'm watching and listening to thg his, I'm crying my eyes out. My mother is a three year survivor💜
Thank you, Tom.  I've been pushing through this I was diagnosed last year with PV blood cancer. You're song has helped me in a major way again Thank you.
Vitamin B17 (Laetrile), Fenbendazole, Urine Therapy, Rick Simpson Oil, GCMaF, proteolytic enzymes as used by Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez (rip) and Dr Linda Isaacs, just to name a few….  Yes, real, effective treatments are hidden/shelved/ridiculed… Just look at ivermectin during this current fiasco… Yes, they want us dead it’s up to us to be informed.
1:57 is Tom you listed the GOP & Corporate DEMs platform to run on for the last 6 circles… we need to break through those c**ts so real people needs can be sorted… E.g. Like tying someone to a job that gets no pay rises or no increased holidays, etc. because if they leave, at least for 3 months or even ever; they risk them and their family’s health…  that’s not capitalism…  That is tying a farm worker to a farm because when it was ruled you have to pay your farm workers, they didn’t say what the Workers had to be paid with, so the Farm owner paid them in money that could only be used at their Farms Shop’ sound familiar?
The reason we don’t have a cure is because ‘Cancer’ is a catch all diagnosis when really it’s 400+ different types of illness’ and while we have haven’t found cures for a majority, we have with a lot of ‘cancer’s’ & not being death sentence, like skin cancer    testicular cancer (97%), melanoma of skin (92.3%) and prostate cancer (88%) So we are making progress… pinky promise :)🇬🇧
Cancer is a disease that comes from your body and your cells don’t see any problems because cancer still disguises itself as your cells and even the cancerous cells believe that they are fine. Your body does have some method of preventing cancer but that usually involves kicking the cells out of the body or maybe the cells voluntarily leave. Sunburns are a good example of cells volunteering to leave in order to protect your body from cancerous DNA. Your body might know more about cancer than the doctors who are trying to help but your body knows garbage so give the doctors a break because they are only able to get treatment and that’s it.
I'm homeless and thank God for my life every single day. Natural cures for cancer. Thank you Tom McDonald for your music makes me young again. I'm only 65 young and getting younger
Tom ...this song just gave me goosebumps ...every word is 💯
Thank you Tom. From a nurse who has worked on a cancer unit with the strongest and bravest people I have ever met going through hell. Thank you.
I agree they could cure and prevent cancer but NEVER will cuz the evil make too much $$$ from it and dont care about people suffering they put chemicals in the water, food, products we use etc to get cancer , same with diabetes they promote it they will never cure that either at least with type 2 you can do it yourself to reverse it, but doctors wont ell you how they need you sick to make money
Amen❣️I do truly believe in my heart that there are cures out there for a lot of diseases that the public is not aware of. Big Pharma would be hit too hard!! It seems like here lately people are out for themselves; money, money🤷🏼‍♀️where’s compassion for others. I mean think about it, if it were you or someone you truly love going through this shit wouldn’t you do all you could to survive❤Keep speaking out No Matter who it Offends 🥰
I was diagnosed in 2016 with Cancer at 39 years old…VIN3. This song is the truth keep inspiring, speaking the truth and doing you! I’m 45 now and pray for a few more years with my daughter and husband! ❤ ✌🏻🎶🙏🏻 Oh and my aunt served 25 years in Air Force, she is surviving lung cancer
2 years later and I'm back to this video.. My grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer a few months ago, man life sure can hit you hard. She's fighting but there are now other complications that are making her overall condition worse.. we haven't even seen what her insurance is willing to cover and what we'll have to pay yet..
I'm currently battling my third relapse of cancer. This song is one of the many of his that is helping me through this. Your exactly right they do have a cure but won't release it unless you can benefit them
I’m fighting cancer now hate the chemo and times I want to give up. My sis in law showed me this song today
These things that pull us down are what rises us up and makes us show strength children are the strongest God bless them
Big pharma is never going to bring out the cure we know it's there. If they cure cancer they're going to go broke
this song is true, that radiation  treatment, wtf . knowing someone who had cancer  for almost 3 years and it barely grew on chemo, a month after radiation it spread all threw his body but hey radiation is a  treatment.
Fk cancer. Big love to Tom!
I just survived Hodgkin's Lymphoma Cancer that nearly killed me and I know that treatment helped but Jesus Christ is the only real reason I'm here. There IS hope, love and life for the future and after this life through Jesus! 🙏💗
Just Lost my Mom To Cancer. I Watched her take her last breath. She was such a fighter. Thank you for this song
Anyone battling cancer,as I am I give u the UTMOST RESPECT....WE ARE THE WARRIORS, THE CHOSEN...GOD BLESS U ALL
I just lost my dad to cancer last Sunday. This song really hits home.
Wtf is this? Wack
Beat cancer 8years ago, it like to kill me, it's back this will be my battle, it's a personal battle, know God has his hand on you the whole time, weather you believe or not.
Seeing this for the first time. I cried.  I lost 3 family members to cancer. My mom just was told she is cancer free after 5 years.  Thank God above. But my father wasn't so lucky. We lost him in 2017. I truly believe there is a cure, but if we aren't sick, pharma can't continue to get rich! I pray for all who are fighting! Godd Bless. Thank you Tom for your truth you give us!

He only speaks the truth with every song he puts out.
Awesome tune!
Wow, so much truth coming from the mouth of a millennial.. An amazing video from an amazing individual! I got a little choked up on this one after witnessing my sister's battle with lymphoma. Thanks Tom!
Lost my wife 3/15/22 to cancer or the stupidity of the system.....hope those in charge are feeling great when my 3 and 5 yr old girls cry for their mom.   FUCK PHARMA  All they want is another drug chemo or radiation to promote not anything about getting to the root of the disease.... WTFFFFFFFF....do no harm....really?!!!?!!!? Ya'all done that...now replace that if you even could do that if you have the balls and conscience to motivate that.   You make the coin and sling the drugs but don't give a f#$Ck if they live to have their kid's hugs.  It's as if they are a tool in the school that gives you the diploma to kill.....is that great MF step off the train...  POS bitches that live off our dear dying with "I'm sorry it's reached their brain...".....Fuck you and live like us....  you piss poor piece of shit learn some new way to cure this.....why you are all bought by the pharma you suck.....question the system that isn't solving or proposing any figment of a solution.   Or perhaps your soul goes to hell too and that's great but how many could you have saved too?
Just had cancer cut out of me in 2020, so I guess you could say I beat it kinda because I am forever changed, as well as disabled. And you were spot on when saying that the treatment can kill you! Both chemotherapy and radiation are super vile and brutal. So many should thank you for this song/message, I know I thank you!
Tom I've started listening to your music three days ago and moved on to interviews then this song, you know what, God has given you heart and talent to preach and speak the truth where noone else wants to venture, please never ever go back to drugs or alcohol the world needs you to be healthy and strong. You have many more to reach especially the younger generation the ones that are confused. You're absolutely correct the media and politicians are playing with people's lives. Keep up the great work God bless you and your family
Please peeps donate for Christmas  b kind for 4 mins u will feel better 4 it peace hope unity light blessings to all .

So true Tom. Sad fact that they know the cure but only use it for those evil people in power and all of the cabal. Hope justice comes to them soon and they rot in hell.
Cure is not profitable…Cancer victims will never see that cure…they created it for a reason
♥️❤️
I love it. Lost my brother and best friend (Dave)5 yrs ago. And found out my big brother is stage 4. How many more is it gonna take to for them to release the cure. COVID cure in four months. And cancer 40 yrs. With no cure. Stop playing with lives. America has to stand and demand.
Wow so good Tom and Nova so good
He is truthful, that what matter 👍
My husband died of a rare form of cancer October 20 2022.
B254 they put the cancer inya
12 years clean!
Prophet Manuel Johnson of Torrance CA, shared on Elijah Streams 2yrs ago God told'em they always had the cure for Cancer, but are hiding it.  Bottom line Bro, revealing to the public this truth is not profitable. They will reap all they've sown.
Of course they have a cure for cancer as well as other illness, we can't escape everything that they are spraying us with, crops polluted soil, water full of fluoride which is the main ingredient in Prozac, we have no choice but to eat their poison and try not to think about what's in it. We're just petri dishes, pawns in their sick games.☘️☘️☘️🇮🇪
true.....................cancer sux................................i've known/loved too many who fought and lost AND many who fought and won...get checked, ask questions, demand answers! FIGHT!!!!
I was diagnosed couple of months ago.  Thank you
As a cancer survivor, I am obsessed with this song.  Ty
I had cancer back in 2004 I’ve been cancer free since 10 years old, thank you!
Dang......a gift to call out the BS in our corporate environment
wow!
Chlorine Dioxide will cure cancer . There's just no $ 4 big pharma in cures so thats why they wont admit
Omg im in tears 😢 I just found out my breast cancer has metastasized and is now in my lungs, im only 33
You continue to amaze me Tom with your compassion. You are a legend.
I agree with Tom. There's totally a cure for cancer but they won't give it because it would put Big Pharma out of business. Prayers to anyone fighting this horrible disease, don't give up! <3
December 2015 I had a double mastectomy IDK why God has me here but I'm willing to find out!
cancer claimed my dads number this year this song helps
and of course there the T.H.C. oil which of course is banned and illegal
In 1931 Dr. Warburg won his first Nobel Prize for proving cancer is caused by a lack of oxygen respiration in cells. He stated in an article titled "The Prime Cause and Prevention of Cancer... the cause of cancer is no longer a mystery, we know it occurs whenever any cell is denied 60% of its oxygen requirements..."
people need to self educate Burzynski: The Cancer Cure Cover-up. rather than Rockefeller false educating of parroting bs back for a paper diploma for big pharma look at the state of distrust on Dr's Nurses the medical system..... just saying
to think nobody knows w.h.o. Raymond Rife is?
He's right cancer has affected everyone . This song hits home , again every time I hear something new , Wow mind 🤯Blown ! HOG family rocks !!!!!
make it They done like 40 years of research, 90 billion in donations We've been running for the cure and wearing ribbons for ages Why are people still going through radiation? It's fucking crazy  100 billion dollar industry, they can't afford to end it And nobody wants to die, our only option is to spend it We give anything to stick around for just another second Give a fortune to the doctors who promise they can extend it The profits are astronomic, the hospitals and the clinics Are filling coffins with dollars, it's awful, let's just admit it We're all human, we'll keep fighting 'cause it's how we survive But it's scary 'cause we don't know where we'll go when we die  Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart  Nothing matters if you don't have your health All the money in the world doesn't help The good might go to Heaven and the bad might go to Hell But no one wants to leave here, you can tell  And cancer touches everyone, it's in our genetics And our world's become so toxic, it's all carcinogenic We've polluted the water, the air, the food we're ingesting It's full of hormones and poison, our population's infected They sell us cigarettes and liquor, built a business on addictions We've been paying them to kill ourselves, we're dying to keep living It's the system, it's a prison, we keep trying to beat it We get cancer from keeping all of our demons a secret  And our insurance don't cover the things we need to defeat it And even if it does, then we might die from the treatment Our best defense is living like we do not know what cancer is Fight it if you have it and pray that there's something after this  Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart  You won't know how to be brave 'til you choose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength 'til you struggle to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith 'til you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take 'til you realize you didn't break  Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart
I'm 😭 and I haven't even finished the song! I don't have cancer but I have MS and I have to get a chemo treatment every 28 days in order not to be paralyzed .. I was diagnosed at 31.. I'm 38 now and everyday is a struggle.. I struggle but I'm still alive and Ill be damned if I give up on life, I've lost everything including my kids and I've tried to commit suicide many times and I know now that I am here for a Reason! Drugs may numb my pain but my heart hurts.. I'm tired of being sick and tired... But regardless I'm not going to stop being Me!  There is No Cure for Multiple Sclerosis!
There is a book by G Edward Griffin called World Without Cancer. It would be nice if everyone would read this book. I heard a woman found a cure for cancer in Germany and they banned her from here in the US. Tom MacDonald makes a great point. I believe there can be a cure for cancer but it makes too much money.
Saturday is the ONLY SABBATH
My dad got diagnosed with cancer 2 yard ago and yesterday he lost the battle but heaven gained a warrior. As much hate Tom gets this is by far one of the most powerful songs he’s ever written. I’ve been listening to this song since then and Tom I will forever thank you for this. You will always have my respect
Got me in tears I’m a cancer survivor finally in remission ❤️
My mom died from cancer over 20 years ago leaving all five of us her kids orphans from age 2-13. This song made me miss her so much! Haven’t thought about it like this for years! Fuc* cancer! Prayers tonight for any and all fighting that battle! God bless you! And thanks Tom!
I lost my son to Gleoblastoma brain cancer in 2019 this song hits hard in my heart
Oh this song! 🥺
My dad is dying from cancer, 8 years his battle is almost over he is in his final few days in hospice. I'm 23 now and I wish we had more time together id give anything to have another year with him. Cherish the people you have now don't take them for granted. life is fragile and you need to do everything you can to protect it and cherish the time you have.
Timeless music with conscious message. ART.
As new fan and an old man I had to wait awhile to watch this one because I knew it was gonna hurt.
Just got the call about my grandfather having cancer. I came straight here.
Lost my son to cancer, he was only 9 years young man💔😭🎗️😇🧸fly high my sweet TarBear and always watch over Mommy!! I love you buddy😭💔
Cancer does a cure and will work on most. Joe Tippen My Cancer Story Rocks. Look it up. Hope it helped someone🙏❤🙏❤
I love you dad. I promise il help you as long as u don't give up on yourself. #fuckcancer
This song is Amazing.... I'm trying to type thru tears.... You are an amazing artist. Thank you!
This song hits so damn close for me. I'm fighting this cancer in my body and I feel like all this chemotherapy is doing is extending my life since I'm only given 20-30% survival chance. Your videos are awesome with great messages. Keep them coming... Thanks.
I’m one year out from my diagnosis. Breast cancer at 33y/o. First major surgery two months later. They got it all! Time to reconstruct the mess that was left. Two more surgeries, Still taking meds for the foreseeable future, but I’m making it.  And I stumbled on this song last week. I don’t think I’ve stopped crying since then. The song is so beautiful. Tom and Nova, you are angels. This wasn’t a pity song. No, this was ‘you got this, b*tch!’ Made me feel better about my own journey. Keep up the wonderful work, you two. Thank you.
Man thank you for this song... I am currently battling cancer in several parts of my body. I have 2 big tumors, one in my pancreas and one one my colon. I have cancer in my colon, rectum, pelvis, and metastisized in my liver. I'm only given about 20-30% survival chance but to me that's better than 0%.... Thank you for the support thru this song. ♥️
Still so good
Proton radiation  therapy...it works
Just heard this song for the first time. Lost my dad to cancer earlier this year. Fuck cancer.
This song has not gotten NEARLY enough attention and views! This is a deep powerful song that I don't think many of you understand the implications of! They have not been trying to cure cancer no matter what they tell you! It's all a lie and a way to take everything you have while they keep you alive just long enough to do it and milk as much of your insurance and belongings as they can!! ... "I swear that cancer has a cure but they're refusing to make it" ... He's right on the money and this affects EVERYONE!! Who else is calling this out that you can think of?!? ... Right on Tom!!
Preach! 😢❤
I can see the makeup on her forehead
Suicide must be one of the most painful things a mother/father can experience, I wish I would get cancer or any deadly disease.
I just as of this month turned 40 and have been a paraplegic since spinal stroke left me without use of my legs during a surgery that I almost died from 3 years ago (2 weeks in a comma) my kidneys shut down and my family was planning my funeral on top of that I have had too kinds of cancer, colon, and lung I am currently in remission but I'm sure not for long. I have looked at all kinds of dating sites from my computer from the nursing home I am currently trapped in and have found nothing but girls who lie and  just don't even give me the time of day. its depressing to say the least I just wish I could find someone honest and is just interested in relationship, also some women can be so mean. I have asked women out in the facility I have to live in and they all lie and say the have boyfriends or some other way of not giving me a chance at all, also my mother died of cancer and my dad is currently with hospice and will die any day now because he has brain cancer but only us three are the only ones who have ever had it in our family, all I do is stare at these four walls. If my cancer doesn't kill me first I am thinking of ordering some strait razors and cutting my arms vertically and killing myself. its so lonely no one comes to visit because of there own health issues as mentioned above, I have a brother nearby but he only visits every three months or so and only for like 15 minutes and then leaves.i will wrap this up by saying life is like that present you really wanted at Christmas when you where young and it turns out to be a pair of socks, some shit you never wanted in the first place.i truly wish I was never born. Show less   REPLY
lol talking guy who has so much ink in his skin :D i dont think its healthy
My best friend has had cancer for the past 4 years & I can’t even listen to this song without crying like a baby hearing this song & thinking of her….you rock Tom ❤
Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart You won't know how to be brave 'til you choose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength 'til you struggle to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith 'til you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take 'til you realize you didn't break  This part hurts the soul
CANNABIS OIL CAN CURE CANCER
Holistic is best
Cancer is not ONE thing you know rigth? thats why is foolish to talk about one cure
Amazing ❤
It's in all the jabs. Proof is on the NIH website. Same w/ child leukemia.
BORON!
❤️🤘🏼🇺🇸
My Mom died of cancer  I look at this song Every day since Tom Made this 2yrs ago. Today I Watched.... ..  Thank You My Friend 💗😌

My fight against C started 5-19-1971 T Mac expressed my thoughts
soooo true....Cancer IS curable!!!
But yet they came up with a vaccine for the virus 😢lost my father to cancer and a few recently family members have it, it sucks
YES to all of this!!
Two years later… hearing this when I needed to. 🙏🏽
Absolutely beautiful! Thank you for this song. My Daddy, my Auntie (Mom’s sister), and my Mother-In-Law each passed away from cancer within the last 3 years. My Soul Sister is currently battling cancer all over her body. It’s devastating. This song just gave me a spark of fire that I desperately needed. 🔥❤️🙏
this is a reality, CDS!!  is the option!! an  kill the parasits!!
Lost my mom to cancer 12 years ago on October 13. My mom was planning a big birthday party for me on October 18th for my birthday. Instead of a birthday party I lost my mom then I took all her pills she had in the house and was in a coma for over a week. I pulled through and this is always the roughest week of my life. This has me in tears.
Reading through these comments an this fella singing this song, now this is a support group I feel gets it an while I deal with my cancer has helped!!
This song is my every day life! I have stage 3 lung cancer an cancer in the adrenal glands. I've had many family an friends die from this torture. I sit at night looking at my kids wondering if I will survive an sometimes hope I don't cause of the pain. THIS SONG IS JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING MANY OF US CANCER PAITENTS GO THROUGH!
Fuck cancer
He's telling the truth. Cancer is a very curable scam and the toxins they put in our food and drink causes it.  Eat organic, get off fatty sugary crap and juice green venues and clean your bodies out.  Thanks for sharing truth Tom...
MY EYES ARE TEARING UP RIGHT NOW WHY COULDN'T THEY MAKE A CURE I LOST MY AUNT AND I ALMOST LOST ANOTHER BUT SHE MADE IT
I love it all, but this hits home ! I cry every time I listen to it. And I BELIEVE IT'S THE TRUTH! BIG PHARMA CAN FIND A CURE!
Everybody knows someone who's sick 40 percent will get cancer, only half's gonna live Your mom and your dad and your sister stand inside a room And someone won't survive it, do you hope it isn't you? I swear that cancer has a cure, but they're refusing to make it They done like 40 years of research, 90 billion in donations We've been running for the cure and wearing ribbons for ages Why are people still going through radiation? It's fucking crazy 100 billion dollar industry, they can't afford to end it And nobody wants to die, our only option is to spend it We give anything to stick around for just another second Give a fortune to the doctors who promise they can extend it The profits are astronomic, the hospitals and the clinics Are filling coffins with dollars, it's awful, let's just admit it We're all human, we'll keep fighting 'cause it's how we survive But it's scary 'cause we don't know where we'll go when we die Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart Nothing matters if you don't have your health All the money in the world doesn't help The good might go to Heaven and the bad might go to Hell But no one wants to leave here, you can tell And cancer touches everyone, it's in our genetics And our world's become so toxic, it's all carcinogenic We've polluted the water, the air, the food we're ingesting It's full of hormones and poison, our population's infected They sell us cigarettes and liquor, built a business on addictions We've been paying them to kill ourselves, we're dying to keep living It's the system, it's a prison, we keep trying to beat it We get cancer from keeping all of our demons a secret And our insurance don't cover the things we need to defeat it And even if it does, then we might die from the treatment Our best defense is living like we do not know what cancer is Fight it if you have it and pray that there's something after this Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart You won't know how to be brave 'til you choose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength 'til you struggle to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith 'til you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take 'til you realize you didn't break Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart
God bless you Tom...
#truestory
This is such a truth song... it is the system...keep speaking the truth Tom...❤
How can he have less than 40k when this song is so deep and the truth
Chemo = Battery Acid PERIOD. And what causes the cancer gene to become cancer? Answer= An Acidic Body. It's all about our diet and how we eat. Natural Cure? Black Grapes... A Long Term (as in months) Grape fast has been shown to kick cancer out of the body. Revelation 9:21 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their SORCERIES, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts. MIND BLOWER INBOUND... Sorceries from the Koine Greek = φαρμακεία (pharmakeia)... What is the translation of this word? G5331 pharmakeia = the use or the administering of drugs, poisoning, medication ("pharmacy"), i.e. (by extension) magic (literally or figuratively):—sorcery, witchcraft, sorcery, magical arts, often found in connection with idolatry and fostered by it... God knew LONG before he created man that an EVIL company would emerge. AND, call themselves BIG PHARMA... No prescribed drug by the witches in white coats heals anything. All it does is put a blanket over the issue. But it sure is good business for the witches in white coats and for Big Pharma. WHY? Side Effects = more business and more drugs = more business and more drugs = more business and more drugs. Ask a Dr. Are you a healthcare provider? 9 time out of 10 they will respond with, (I PRACTICE Medicine.)  Just like witches practice witchcraft.  GET THE POINT?
thank you for this song, I have leukemia and this gives me the spirit to fight
As a son of a mother whose had breast cancer twice, this hits on a whole new level. Nobody will ever be fully cured and it’s heartbreaking. “No one wants to leave here, you can tell.”
Bro thank you so much for this. I'm fighting so hard man. It sucks so bad... I'm not afraid to go I'm just worried for those I might leave behind man... Much Love Brother 💯
Radiation  is hard towards the end..it works...chemo,immunotherapy, kills.if u survive daily radiation and the burns,U have been FORGED IN FIRE....I DO IT WITH NO PAIN MEDS...I AM CHOSEN....I AM A MIRACLE...TY GOD,DADDY,MAMA,KELLY,KIM... .
This song is soul. Like wow man. 🙏🙏
The first time I heard this it reminded my when my mom, grandfather, and my uncles wife had cancer. My mom has been in remission for 12 years. My grandfather has been in remission for four years and my uncles wife passed away from breast cancer last year.
In fight it..I STAND  ALONE. GOD BLESS U TOM
This is so damn TRUE LOOK WHAT THEY DO TO CHILDREN.  ITS ALL COMING TO END...WHAT THEY HAVE DONE...
For my father,2nd lt.GUNNERY SRGT.ROBERT LEE SHINN...I FIGHT 4 MY FAMILY. TY DADDY
When we die,we go to heaven..we are WARRIORS,FIGHTERS.WE DESERVE BETTER.FOR ALL BATTLING THIS I SEND U ❤ 😍 💖 ❣ 💕 💘
Baking soda
Awesome, nice work Tom
Father has prostrate cancer, fought it into remission. His brother my uncle was lost due to throat cancer. Scary when you know its in our genes!!!Love the track. RESPECT! for the raw honesty.Sorry to all who have lost loved ones.👇
Way over 100 countries have natural or progressive SAFE ways of curing cancer that WORK! But we're FORBIDDEN to know about them, because oncology is such a lucrative industry, just like you said, Tom. Ask an oncologist whether he would give he or she would give these drugs (which carry black box warnings that say "causes cancer" and many they have to handle with gloves) them to their families. Most say no. That should tell you something...
Such a powerful song 🔥❤️🔥 RIP Blaine 🙏
If all the companies doing research would share their findings there is a good chance something can be done, but they all want to be the one that comes up with something.  The research is not about saving lives it is about money and owning rights to a cure.   A lot can be done to stop certain cancers.  Lets look at vaping, far less of a problem over cigarettes, yet the US wants to stop vaping but let cigarettes keep on going.  The UK has put vape shops in hospitals to get people to switch, the EU is pushing for people to switch.  The US gets billions and billions every year on cigarette taxes, that is the only reason I can see for them to try to stop vaping.  Makes no sense.
this was beautiful. I lost a friend to cancer a few years ago. my cousin overcame leukemia and now another friend is fighting it. I usually dont like rap but I've really enjoyed your music. It's nice to see an artist that wants to not just to be heard but also wants to share a message with us and to reach us on multiple levels. Thank you!
Is there an address I can send something to Tom and Nova in appreciation of their great work?
Tom,  I'm curious.....from the sound of all of your songs, you write them based on your own experiences. So my question is...... Did you have cancer or did someone close to you have it? I just think it would be hard to write a song without some sort of experience with it? I hope you answer me back so I, we, your fans will know. Thanks and keep writing and singing..... All of your songs are truly 110% 🔥
High dose cannabis... No not smoking, im talking real high doses... RSO (Rick Sampson OIl) FSO (Full Specrum Oil)... Cannabis causes apoptosis in cancer cells, basically tells them to commit suicide. Cancer is a mental battle as much as a physical one. Stay strong. Stay Stay bright. Radiate your light <3
My Dad and I are both survivors...this song made us both an emotional mess...Thank You Tom...We needed that moment....
Powerful
THIS SONG SAVED MY LIFE. THANK YOU TOM AND NOVA. ILL SPEND EVERYDAY SHARING YOUR MUSIC BECAUSE NOBODY HAS EVER MADE SUCH AN IMPACT ON MY SURVIVAL. IM SHOWING MY FLAME TO THE WORLD EVERYDAY. ILL NEVER GIVE UP HOPE. CHANGES HAVE TO BE MADE FOR THE BETTER. ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL SONG OF TRUTH. MUCH LOVE 💕 TO YOU AND NOVA.❤😊
Tom I live in CANADA ,I DONT shop much so I hope they sell your CDs 🤔 here ,I guess I got a reson to shop 🤢 but for you and Nora's talent too it's gonna be worth it , the funny thing is I don't have a cd player lol
Apple cider vinegar.  Vitamin B17. Eliminate sugar from your diet. The list goes on and on. Please do the research!
Thanks Tom lost my mom at 50 my best friend at 23 ,I do think they know too 😪👿
much love thomas mcd .. young raw
There is a cure..Radiation  is hard...it works..so does hope,fight,and prayers 🙏 ❤ 🙌 😢
My son, had testicular cancer surgery at age 21.  Lost his manly ability.  Then a year later he had lymphoma surgery.  They extracted over 20 lymph nodes.    The first surgery was necessary, the second was a con job!
I’m sad because I only found out about Tom yesterday what a talent
Everyone! Check out Dr Berg, Dr Berry, Shawn Baker MD, and many others. Cancer feeds off of sugars and with all of the high carb diets we now have, which is not natural to humans, it is understandable how cancer is becoming more and more prevalent. Look at a keto and fasting lifestyle.
This one got me!  😭
Still fighting 💪 for my  life.COVOID NOW AND AHH MORE C DIFF...STAY STRONG. RIDE FREE
Cancer my Grandma 2000 my mum 2012 my uncle 2013 my aunt 2016 my aunt 2018 my aunt 2222 may they rest in peace There's a cure I bet my life on it.But the thousands of pharmaceutical companies are making billions and millions.and the other scum who feed off cancer suffers. The pharmaceutical industries save some but many more die.coz if the cure came out.The money will stop dead sharp. Just think about it this is no crazy conspiracy theory it's a real fact. TC from Marcus ✌️👍
I can’t listen to this without the ugly cry. I beat cancer after a 5 year battle. I had it metastasized in my bone marrow when I was pregnant with my beautiful baby and didn’t know til I had her. She just turned 18. I just turned 48.   Thank you for this gift Tom!
Radiation  is hard..it works..this is for MON GENERAL..DR.LITTLES..I LOVE U MY BFF...ALWAYS.GO WITH GOD
Please from the vet run for president please God bless you
For anyone  battling  cancer as I am,NEVER EVER GIVE UP,IN,OR QUIT.I DID...I CAME BACK....FIGHT. IN GODS NAME...AMEN
Lost my daughter 2 months ago, this song sounds like it was for her. She fought hard and made it longer than she was given to live. Thank you.
My Mom died of cancer on December 15, 2020. She didn’t want to fight it. I miss her so much. Oh god, now I’m sitting here quietly bawling to myself.  Her doctor said more and more people are getting cancer every year, and they don’t know why.  My city recently voted to put fluoride back in the water supply. They say it’s perfectly safe and good for your teeth. But I have questions: what if it’s not actually perfectly safe? What if it’s one of the reasons for the cancer increase? Even if it is good for our teeth, why do we have to swallow it? I only have teeth in my mouth. So why do we have to put it in the supply of something we need to swallow to live? Why do people tell me I’m stupid for questioning this?  I miss my Mom. :(
Sept 9th 2021 my Husband passed away from cancer through out his whole body they were worried about his brain the most 10 rounds 10 days they never told him he was already dying... they were positive and sadly he lost his battle 33 days after we found out
Only 3.7 million views is criminal
Dude, wanna know what happens when we die???? Well it depends. I’ll quote a red hot chilli peppers, ‘nothing better than love and service’ ❤
Inflammation. Wheat since the forties, dwarf hyrbid, causes an opiate receptor addiction, obesity began in the fifties here, and everywhere it went, China, Japan. When Ramen started using it. On and on. And its a inflammatory and not what our bodies adjusted to. Sugar, especially refined backs the issue with liver fighting and kidney and muscle attachment inflammation. Hip surgeries. Cancer. Bone marrow deficiencies. When then sugar level in your body is too high it only has one way to lower it, with the bones in your body because you cant stop eating it, repeating it. All these are related. Wake up. When two slices of wheat bread make your blood sugar higher and longer than two tablespoons of sugar, its time to think about who is testing what and why. The term Exorphin got created because the testing on that wheat bore out that the body produces an enzyme that passes the blood brain barrier to bind to your opiate and endorphin receptors, its the biggest opiate drug on the planet.. killing the world. And that all came from the NIH, who the paid off FDA ignored because 75% of their funding comes from Big Pharma, and guess who makes all the money.. teaching the doctors to be Patent drug and Patent Procedural salesmen. Killing not curing, for profit.
My brother died of colon cancer 12 years ago and that hit very hard watching fade away after all the chemo he had undergone. 6 years ago out of the my wife was diagnosed with a stage 3 brain tumor the size of an orange that was suppose to kill but 6 years later after many months in hospitals and rehab learning how to walk again she is now cancer free and working 40 hours a week as a Neonatal nurse so never give up hope and prayer because miracles Do happen. Pro Tip: If you are a spouse of someone with cancer leave your doubts at the door when you visit them and show them nothing but positive thinking and that you both WILL make threw it Together.        You will Never know how strong You can be until strength is all you have left.
My Mom passed from Ovarian Cancer... wow this hits hard.
I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when I heard this the first time it broke me down on a residential framing crew... my guys saw tears in my eyes and I told them about my 15 yo nephew who has fought a tumor on his brainstem over half his young life
Tom,as a stage 4 cancer survivor,I can tell.u first hand,radiation  isn't  hard..it's painful  afterwards, but in my case,I thrived.chemo,immunotherapy  thats the killer.STAY FREE MY FRIEND.LOVE FROM CLARKSBURG ,WV
Message to all the people who know their going to die from cancer, terminal?   Do you believe there is a heaven or hell? Are you scared to find out?  Is it scary knowing you're going to die 100%? What kind of emotion do you feel?
My dad died 7 years ago to cancer. This hits hard
Been 1 1/2 yrs since I first heard this and it still hits me. With numerous family members who have been afflicted and fought this murderous disease, your words ring very true.  Thank you again Mr. MacDonald❤❤
I just visited my grampa for the first abd last time in a long time a few weeks after he was diagnosed with lung cancer, he is going to be dead in a few days and I honestly don't know how to handle it,  he has been there my whole life, I'm going to miss him so much
My Mother in law is going thru a double mastectomy, neck and lymphoma cancer and I'm afraid to show her this video, but it helps me get thru, thank you, bro..you for sure have heart....deep respect.
I'm a cancer survivor myself. When I was 9 years old I was diagnosed with non hodgekins lymphoma stage 3. I love the song speaks to heart keep up the good music
So sad 😭
Thank you Tom.
Felt this pain...
Making me cry. So powerful! Thank you!!
My brother died of cancer. He was my safety net. My father had to bury him... At his wake I was one of the only family members able to speak. It broke a piece of me. And Tom has helped me. Tom has kept me around. And if not for him idk. I wish I could see him hold my son's. Didn't make it that long. Seeing him with it on his neck. That leaves a hole that Tom helps seal. It will never heal completely. But Tom sure is an amazing stitch. Thank you Tom
I have stage 3 colon cancer and my name means born of fire
Thank you for this video Thomas. This was absolutely AWESOME.
Thank You Tom! Cancer hit me but I'm still standing. Saw the birth of my Grandson Aug 30 2022 and I hope he turns out as good as you!
My hair is still falling out and the big surgery is in13 days.  I’ve got shit to do! And I’m staying on Earth to do it.
My comment was not  against Tom MacDonald, he's the greatest in a generation and speaks honesty in his raps,, My comment was more about how little people care about real issues (like cancer) ....People like others in these comments deserve to know why cancer isn't closer to being cured.... I think I have the answer (yup Im sinical) I'ts a multi billion dollar industry.... Big pharma could give a fuck about you and our families, only our bank accounts.
Rap battle tracks and other meaningless songs get 10's of millions of views, yet a song like this who effects most of us and shows real heart gets 3.6 after 2 years..  I'm not gonna share my story, but Tom is a real one.
Please GOD,IM 😔  HEAL ME
We are the chosen ✨ 😎 🙌 😌  ones
They  do NY man 👨 😭.GOD.
I just heard this song I love it It mad me cry i just got done with my treatments and radiation they say I'm cancer free now it was a hard road to travel not just for me but for my family too I wish I could have heard this song sooner so I could have listened to it everyday cause some days going through treatment was rough    I add this song to my playlist so I can listen to it everyday thank you Tom and Nova for the support you show with this song it helps more then you could ever know
A very heartfelt song!
Yo
Just lost my father to pancreatic cancer...hit us like a ton of bricks. He was fine a few months ago. Diagnosed July 8th...passed away August 21st. Love you Pappy...miss you always.  Hug your family...you never know when that last day will come.
My dad and my sister passed within 3 years of each other both from cancer. My grandmother passed from cancer during the period in-between their deaths. I gave all of their eulogies. 6 years later and I still haven't been able to let myself process it.
One of the finest young men I have ever heard. I do not know you,..., but I feel your spirit, and it is so rich.  Blessed Be to YOU!- SLM
I never know what to expect from you. Got me crying like a bitch with this one. I miss you Mom.
I miss u Dr LITTLES,MY SAVIOUR,MY FRIEND
I'm begging 4 one more round of radiation
😢 Damn it tom!
This song has me in tears.. My stepmother has cancer and we know it will kill her eventually. This should not be a thing people have to go through.
At this point,I'd sell.my soul for one more round of radiation
Hit me in My “feels”.  Lost 2, 3rd is stage 4…. Thank you for making me want to love more.
Love Tom MacDonald and love all his songs, but this one gives me anxiety listening to it not sure why?
Tom McDonald for president, anyone agree 💯👍
Wish I would have herd this song before  I lost my mom and dad to cancer now my aunty  I am scared when I get older for my kids   what's gonna happen to me
All my comments are missing. Why? I came back to this song many times.
I'm not gonna lie this song helped me out a little not because of cancer or anything but because of fear. For so long I had blamed God because I thought he made me scared of facing problems, but this song helped me realize fear comes from the devil. "You don't know why you have faith til you look the devil in his face". Fight those fears, fight those demons and do it with faith.
100% cancer r*pes my family lost my oldest sister to breast cancer few days before my birthday then my father 8 days after the same year then my mother 2 years later on memorial day and my grandmother the year following.... Fuck Cancer!!
Just noises…just noises….we get on with it ,chop wood carry water 💦 love the way you are tackling cancer of the spirit  Spiritually is like water ,when we feel spiritual we are just getting  wet…. That’s how  recovery keeps coming back ! X
Been fighting cancer for two years now and yes, I'm gonna beat it! Oh do I have a story!
The specialist was in Seattle
They removed almost both sides cancer is f up man.they removed her thyroid and said other side had it too.she had to go to a specialist my grandparents bought a car to drive her too appointments in Seattle.
My mom had thyroid cancer.i know man.
I'm just going to get into It, had Hodgkin's lymphoma stage 4 cancer  , when I was in the hospital this is the first song I ever heard in the hospital , and I believe everything he's saying is facts thank you for getting me through my cancer And PTSD thank you again wish there was more people out their like you ❤️❤️❤️
So much truth in this song. The cancer industry is a machine. But life after death isn’t a guessing game. Paul was the chief of sinners. Heaven’s not for the “good”. We’re all bad. Heaven is for the ones Jesus came to save. For anyone judging God and crying “it’s not fair!” ask Jesus save to you instead of hating Him.
Thank you for the song about cancer.  It really is one of my favorites, of course I love ALL of your songs. You truly are opening up eyes & minds of the people that are blessed enough to hear your voice. Keep them coming, you are a great artist & with a great purpose. Congratulations on being a winner & I'm in remission now. I would be honored if you & your lady could have a private conversation with me. I have been busy trying to make some rhymes for you to work with & I'm curious about what you may think? Go to my Facebook page @ Dolores Baker & pm me please. I know you don't need anyone else to get rhymes for you but I'd really love for you to at least take a look at these. I'm not very good at singing but I sure do tell a great story that I believe needs a great artist such as you to enlighten the world with. Be blessed in ALL you do.
Dam you made me cry. You really know how to get to a woman's heart.
When will all people learn that we eating our lives away... Otto Warburg discovered for 100 years ago that cancer lived and loved high suger in our body. Eat Lchf and Keto too avoid cancer and to get rid of if!
Yes Cancer, I'm a Cancerian. I have medical degree. Cancer is directly related to stress and toxins.  It's been claimed that the Nazi Germans discovered that when a cell does not get oxygen it turns cancerous. Tom I'm doing me best to help you, You're missing some critical data and if you don't get that data in time it could kill you faster than Cancer.
As a cancer patient, I know the pain.i use no narcotics..im.abused....we suffer,our detractors love our pain.WE GO TO HEAVEN...THEY MEET THEIR HELL
For my son Nicholas  Robert Richards,play this when I pass.I TRIED.I LOVED U BESTEST.FORGIVE ME RIP MOM,DAD,KIM AND KELLY.RIP MY SON ANDREW,ALEX...SHINE ON MY SON
My mother had cancer was diagnosed when she was 20years old they found a softball sized tumor in her uterus. She was having chemotherapy when they decided to remove the tumor and got a huge surprise she was pregnant with me. They had given mom 5 years if she had treatment and only 1 year if she stopped the chemotherapy to have me. The doctors said that it would be a miracle if I came out normal said I would be physically and mentally disabled and probably only live 1 -5 years. Guess Mom and I were miracles because mom lived till she was 69(died from Covid-19 this year) and I’m 48 and a cancer Survivor myself. Unfortunately since most cancers are genetic I went through almost the same thing as my mother when I was 26 and found I was pregnant and had developed cancer. Unfortunately I wasn’t as lucky as my mom and my baby was born mentally disabled but physically fine. But given that mom was diagnosed back in the seventies when treatment was truly brutal she and I were both luck to make it as long as we did. Thankfully I’ve been cancer free for 10 years now and counting, I just hope it skips my daughter. 🙏
Thank you, Tom
We’re all sick in our own way it’s sad 😞
I have never seen a better singer who sings so much from the world. very cool... 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😍😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amen...this is me. I stand alone
Yo tom macdonald u are a legend thank you
Well stated!
My mother passed away in 2014 from cancer. To this day i would've gladly gave my own life just to give her 1 more year with my family. ❤️
Thank you Tom.  It’s wonderful to hear you Sing the truth.  Real truth.  Opened my eyes   Keep on Keepin on!
I lost my dad 3yrs ago to cancer and now my big sister has it and I'm afraid I will lose her to cancer I pray everyday that she can fight it to get better
Panacur C with tumeric take by your weight mon-thurs for 3 months- cancer GONE
Lost my entire family,most to cancer. I am stage 4...ty for this
Just lost my mom to cancer august 10th 🙏 it all happened within one month of finding out. My heart hurts 💔 but.. I know she in no longer in pain which is all she ever wanted.  Love you mom ❤️ you'll always be with me and the grandkids
I made a comment 5 months ago she was doing so well then in a flash she got worse. I said goodbye to our my hero Friday night. Rest easy grandma I love you
sadly lost my mum and my aunt and uncle to cancer. but this happens to lots of people.
August 2nd was 5 years since my mom lost her battle to cancer..I lost my father-in-law in January of this year because of cancer. He was good in December & within a week, he was gone. Cancer sucks. I appreciate this song so much 💙
This beautiful song help me a lot 2020 i was in hospital with it
I am in my 2nd year of remission from APL Leukemia. I underwent 140 hours of Arsenic Trioxide  Chemotherapy (yes rat poison). I did this at the beginning of COVID.  I was worried about not making it through treatment or getting ill from a weak immune system. I made it, I'm blessed and it wasn't my time. When people would tell me how sorry they were I'd say, "don't be, there are people in worse condition than me". This song is very sobering, thank you Tom!
YEA TOM I VE GOT STAGE 3 SQUAMISH CARCINOMA ITS MY SECOND BATTLE WITH IT AWESOME SONG THANKS !!!!
The cure for cancer I have it.. it's called a ***Root Beer Float*** Honestly it the cure all..
I'm not...
Are you okay,,
This song has  always meant a lot to me, as a child of a mom with cancer. Then, this past Memorial Day, she lost her last battle with oral cancer, and this song makes me cry every time now. She was the strongest person I ever knew. Rest in Peace, Mama. You are missed so severely. I love you, and I will never stop thinking about and missing you with all my heart....💔
Thank you Tom
LOVE THIS SONG,,,HITS HOME,,,,🥺🥺
My little sister has she's only 6
You're right there's no money in a cure
This song has 0 dislikes! That says it all there, just lost my aunt and my mom is loosing her hair going through chemo now, life's tough everyday but this song deff helps me big time
Grandpa died of cancer. I live everyday like I won't wake up tmrw.
This hit home for my family. We lost our dad in 2004, throat cancer, my husband in 2007, cancer from agent orange while fighting in Vietnam, our mom in 2009, lung cancer. We just found out that our baby brother(50 years old) has colon cancer. Thank you for what you do Mr McDonald. Your songs have touched my soul so many times. God bless you and Nova. Keep up the great work. With much love.
Tom I'm sorry that you struggle with depression I struggle with depression too bipolar issues. I lost someone my father in 2009 to a long and horrible cancer battle. It was like watching Superman die. I feel that pain every day my PTSD is cleared mostly just to anyone out there struggling with the loss somebody from this horrible disease be strong you learn a new normal and you do experience happiness again the sadness comes and goes less often so just hang in there.
Father, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you. I am truly sorry, and now I want to turn away from my past sinful life toward you. Please forgive me, and help me avoid sinning again. I believe that your son, Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer. I invite Jesus to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward. Please send your Holy Spirit to help me obey You, and to do Your will for the rest of my life. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
I lost my Nana to cancer 10 years ago, it was so hard to watch her get progressively worse, but she was strong even in the end. This song touches my heart. Thank you Tom and Nova
I'm battling cancer and abuse.i live alone...no help...for all who have lost a loved one...prayers.THERE IS A CURE....THE SYSTEM IS DEMONIC...TY TOM...U SAVED ME FROM SUICIDE.U AND RYAN UPCHURCH
I've been exploring Tom MacDonalds library and I just listened to this one three times in a row. It is powerful. I was in tears by the first hook and it hasn't stopped. That's how hard it me. If you have had cancer, or some life-threatening issue, or know someone that has or had cancer, I hope you listen to this and it gives you hope.  I have been fighting not one but 2 life-threatening blood disorders for 2 1/2 years now. I am being treated in a cancer clinic by an oncologist. I go in every 4 weeks for an IVIg Infusion and I have seen what cancer does to people from the beginning to the end and it is God awful!!   THANK YOU TOM!!!  THIS IS NOW MY DAILY ANTHEM AND WILL BE THE FIRST SONG I LISTEN TO EVERY DAY UNTIL I AM CURED, AND PROBABLY BEYOND!!!
My brother just passed away this July with brain cancer. It’s hurt me more than anything but this song helps a lot thank you Tom❤️
Tom Yesterday I went to my oncologist and Monday I turned 41. I've been fighting cancer for almost 5 years and it had spread 3 times. I had Non Hodgkin's lymphoma and Adenocarcinoma stage 3 on my colon then my Liver. Had over 2 feet of colon removed and a third of my liver plus a lot of lymph nodes. I got down really low at points and I still don't feel well. Yesterday though I went for the results of my year checkup and as of right now I'm cancer free for a year. This song really helped me through some dark times. All I wanted to do was give up especially after getting bad news everytime I thought it might be good. It's taken a big toll on my body but I'm a survivor and I won't stop fighting. #fuckcancer
We don’t have a cure for cancer after all these years, but they magically pulled a vaccine out of their ass that claims to keep you from getting a brand new virus.
Two years ago , I lost my mother too Bone Cancer, She like your Son will never be Forgotten. Darrin G.
Hoxey faught the Newly formed AMA kept dragging the head of the ama into court for 20 yrs, he cured cancer they didn't want him to, or the lady in Canada with the indian remedy, Dr Sebi, and many others, just like any inventor, or leaders who speak out about the corruption. I had cervical cancer in 04' but stopped chemo and started a cancer diet-very healthy-it disappeared been clear ever since, also Laetril (b-17) will kill it. have to dose by your weight.
The one scientist that helps us all can take on big pharma. Let the people that have cancer live !!!
This song means alot to me, my grandma(aka my best friend) died when i was young and this song speaks to  me on many levels and i appreciate everything that you are doing tom😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤
I miss my dad
Rest in Heaven Grandma
I was 16 when I got cancer and I found out from my doctor who is one of the top three in the nation in his field ( Orthopedic oncology) that there was a big outbreak of bone and soft tissue cancer from around the Fort Campbell area now I see Camp Lejeune is actually having to help families who have gone through all these different diseases because of what they've done and covered up in the past now I want to see if I can help these families who had to do with the military and the ones that had nothing to do with the military but still got hurt because of their kids or their family members getting sick and dying because of what Fort Campbell has done in the past they're actually certain spots on Fort Campbell that civilians aren't allowed to go because of radioactive areas but they make their military men go through that area when my husband told me he saw a glow in the dark spider I didn't know whether to laugh or cry I love our military and I will always support them I come from a big military family and I was actually going to join the Coast Guard or the Air Force but the cancer I was diagnosed with a month before my birthday decided for me what my grandpa told me about Fort Campbell burying radioactive waste made me think and I looked it up and those barrels normally last 40 years that was the same timeline of when the big outbreak of bone and soft tissue cancer happened around here and a lot of parents had to watch their kids die while they got all their money taken away from them just trying to take care of their kid and helping them live I just want to try to help these people anyway I can because when my parents were told I only had a one and four chance of living I watch them spiral and I don't want that for any family
Love your music 🎶🎵
Damn, more hard hitting hella impactful music from Tom. Keep it up Tom, the world needs artists like you!
Both my parents are gone...if you have kids please quit smoking
I'm a cancer Survivor 6yrs +! In my researh I have found 4 + Cures for cancer! My Dad found out he was loaded with cancer, I asked the Dr to perscribe 2 of the cancer cures I'd found, the answer was it is Not an option! I ask why it was Not an option! The answer was it's Not an option! So I said you don't want to help him then! Dad died 6 weeks later. There Are Cures! If you want to know ask! I'll give you the site's, document numbers, and patent numbers that apply, so you can See 👀 for yourself! ❤ Stay Healthy, Stay Live! Love and Peace!
My neighbor passed away too cancer three years ago, this song has helped so much, this is the first song that has actually made me cry. Your music is so strong when it comes to spreading messages based off the topic of the song. Thank you man…
If I smoke weed high THC they said I will go when God needs me
💗💗
2 yrs ago doctors killed my mother with chemo and radiation.  She ended up with a feeding tube that fed her cancer with sugary liquid and if you didn't know, sugar is literally what cancer needs to thrive. No sugar, cancer dies...not the person.
My dad’s friend was a chemist who studied how to get a cure for cancer. He didn’t, but people have found ways on how we can live longer. If a woman gets breast cancer, we can live longer with new medication. It’s not only radiation and chemotherapy anymore. We have too much of a long way too go. We are too behind. It sucks.
Fuck cancer!
Okay apparently we were all born with an inheritance from what the Bible says and we were all called for a purpose and a reason and apparently the devil knows this and that's how he lives but the Bible says anything the devil steals from us we can get back the Bible says the devil comes to lie steal and kill
I saw a baseball game the other day and they passed out cards saying they knew someone or had cancer. some people had handsful of these cards., The whole stadiuim stood. WTH? Im gonna keep on fighting until my last breath. I dont wont give ib to this cancer. Thank you carrying this song at the top of my list.
All I know is God is real beyond man
Okay so this is my theory in the holy Bible it says we all have a cross to pick up to do Christ will and our free will is to choose that but man is moving and it's all confusing due to the fact there is evil in the system to so I'm confused so I say I'm waiting for Christ
They sent my husband home 4 years ago to die with the Lord's help and a Biblical nutritionist he has been cancer-free for 3 years. The medical industry is a bunch of lying shysters that are greedy bastards we could not get anybody from American Cancer Society or anyone to help us because he didn't have breast cancer or prostate cancer. I decided that I wasn't going to give any more money to any more Charities because they're suppressing The Cure not trying to find the Cure. Ty Bollinger did a study called the truth about cancer and the truth about vaccines when we figure out we need to stop going to doctors will be better off let food be your medicine
Just had Cancer removed from my eye and eye socket, my fight isn't over,  but I will never lose hope and never stop fighting #CoCo #SHORTY
My Dad died of three different cancers in February ♥️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏Miss you Dad♥️🙏🙏
This made me cry.  Tom your right they do have a cure for cancer.  But why would they give us the truth when they can make trillions on a lie.
I lost my beautiful sister a few years back don't talk about it much too painful but I remember a week before she passed she got to dance before the Lord and now she's dancing forever thank you Tom beautiful song
WORD
i have cancer i dont think a cure for cancer is realistic but they could be hiding almost complete cancer prevention from us
Protect this man at all costs! 🙏
brother thank you i myself have cancer [mesothelioma] from asbestos yes i did remove it from school in the 80s i am 59 now  and was never told how bad it will be or get i think on how many children we have saved from getting this this song is outstanding and i thank you so much singing from the heart ♥ ♥
Beautiful song. Many family members of mine have had cancer they all fought so hard against it. And I am so sorry for the other people out there who are fighting cancer or watching someone fight it stay strong and keep fighting you are incredibly brave.
God bless this man! He deserves so much and I hope he finds peace and contentness in this life. I hope to meet Tom one day!
Tom McDonald, my grandfather used to tell me that doctors covered their mistakes with TOMBSTONES! I definitely believe what he was saying since the pandemic
My aunt died from cancer I rlly love this song thank you once again Tom Macdonald
As long as your innocent you will visit the Lord
This song made me cry .. as a cancer survivor  I relate so deeply. Agree 100% with your lyrics.
I strongly believe there is a cure, but they make too much money from it.
I just recently found out my grandpa is fighting cancer and I keep listening to this song help cope with the pain of potentially losing another loved one to cancer
I lost my mom on Sep. 10th, 2021 to cancer. This song brought me to tears. Thank you Tom.
WOW great song, Prayer to everyone going through this hell, I did along with my wife and my Mom, we were all luck and beat it
Such a good song made me cry
1977 my sister died from cancer I was 8 and she was 12
I was told a good friend mine was diagnosed with stomach cancer a week ago. She has been through so much in her life and is a God fearing person. But she don't wanna leave the good life she has now made for herself. I pray she bets this. No body deserves to have the Big C. It a a war that we are facing. There has to be a end to this horrible thing.
Thanks Tom keep up the good work your music is amazing 🤘😉
Ty for talking truth Tom
Lost my dad to colon cancer and covid. He spent 3 weeks on the ventilator before we chose to take him off. He lasted 2 mins. He was 5 days away from his cancer surgery. Ty Tom
One of Tom's best IMO   from a stage 3 cancer survivor....6 years cancer free
YouTube search cancer rife made by spooky2 listen as much as your like 👍 it kills cells with out harming good cells
My Grandma has Cancer so many people with Cancer just refuse to die they're so strong the best news is when you're told that you're cancer free as a Christian I pray for my Grandmother's recovery and I'll pray for anyone else who is struggling
I've been lucky so far cancer has not touched my life in the way so many people have but this song still makes me cry every time, it's really a great song Tom. I'm so glad I found you. Our first love was the song America and it's just taken off from there buttholes is another one of my favorite right now thank you
Algorithm bump
Lost my dad 3 years ago to brain cancer Thanks Tom
You are amazing Tom. You touch on real life issues and voice the concerns of the majority. May your faith grow in Jesus. May you physically experience our Heavely Fathers love and grace thru His son, Jesus🙏 Just want to add that I do not enjoy rap music, as a rule. But your lyrics are worth it! As a mom of young adults and a  granny, you give me hope for the younger generation!
you make my future tom macdonald peace for ever
My sweet grandaughter was just officially diagnosed with B-ALL leukemia on june 29th the same night her brother was born with deformitys and is atleast half deaf may be fully dont know yet!!!!  Thank you for this Tom it helps me stay strong 💪  much love and respect!!!!
You don't know how much you can take until you realize you didn't break." I do not know anyone with cancer. I know one person whose wife has cancer but I've never met her. I am one of the lucky ones who has not lost someone to cancer. But I have seen suffering and fighting in different ways. And I was surprised at how strongly this song affected me. Also especially the part where he talked about us pretending it doesn't exist and hoping there's something after this. What an amazing song
My father has been kidnaped.. , eternal repulse to pharma also economical understanding of medicine! True nazis... (A)
I get the since this is personal to you it is to me!!!…. Just wanted to say thank you for this song can’t listen or watch without tearing up its personal to me god bless you tom!!
My best friend beat cancer but still smokes trying to kill himself all over… i love that you have such a wide range of songs that tackle real world and life issues tom.. im a fan and now a subscriber keep doing what your doing. Take down the music industry expose our governments corruption put haters in there place. You are awesome but you already know that.
I had cancer at 33yrs old. I was giving a 3% chance to live. I did chemo and radiation, but I quit and only did 1/3 of the chemo and radiation and accepted death. The chemo was killing me faster than the cancer. I planned to go out and live one hell of a life, and I did. Today I am 14 years in remission and just done my tests....I'm cancer free! I don't advise people to quit their treatments. Just be vocal with doctor's. Keep good mentality, fuction, faith, and interactions with family and friends. Thank you Tom Mcdonald for bringing it to light. We need more like you.
Doctors and hospitals and insurance and pharmaceuticals are all scams I trust herbalist people that actually heal bodies not harm also I have a question!   1. Why the fuck do people trust these so called Doctors who barely make a decent life living of them selves and never heal bodies plus many of them don't even know their herbs how can u be life saver and don't know your herbs and seamoss shocked most never heard of it
Dammit Tom! Im crying like a mofo! I lost my mama to cancer last year. 2.5months between diagnosis and her last breath. She was everything to me! And i thought she’d live forever! Thank you for this
I can't read these comments... I'm not strong enough to go there. Thank you for this song.
Nothing is more cruel or infuriating than the cancer situation. nobody even wants to try the alternatives cause they're too addicted to the causes
I lost my dad to cancer bro this song hits hard but wow you tell so much truth I love u tom.
https://youtu.be/rYPk5ePEBHo try, not to cry!!..!

Your best defense.... is knowing that ALL our deaths including  our own, is, is,  is, is,  inevitable. Sorry its a for sure thing!
Evolve. Spittin about the bigger issues here.
I had a uncle tell me the they did find the cure for cancer in china and aids but their not telling no one unless your rich to fly over their and pay them for the treatment. Idk if he was telling the truth but it does make you think.
love you Tom
I've been in remission for one of my cancers for one year now but it was the biggest fight of my life and I have another type of cancer that is not curable so whenever it decides to become very aggressive I'll be in big trouble I have been having trouble trying to get back to normal life after having cancer and knowing I still have cancer but this song is helped in such a big way realizing how strong I really am and what a fight I put up to be able to survive a cancer that killed my grandfather I'm proud to say I survived not Hodgkin's lymphoma b cell stage 3 I still have follicular cancer and I just pray to God that one day they'll have it cure for it or I pray to God that it never shows it's ugly face before I leave this beautiful planet Tom I want to say thank you for writing such heartwarming music you have a message in all your songs that I relate to everyone you're a special human being and you deserve happiness and success your message is important everybody needs to get it and hear it or we're all in really really big trouble thank you for helping me come out of depression after cancer I suffer from mental health all the time every day it's a battle between addiction and my mental health but I'm proud to say I have beat addiction and I have survived mental health for over 11 years now it did take me to kill myself six times before I realized what a beautiful life this is I never thought I'd be going through depression again but after cancer I don't know where I belong in life that I came across your song a few days ago thank you for saving me for my own demons thank you and Nova both of you guys are my angels you've helped me more than anything or any counselor or any psychologist or any antidepressant drugs and I will always be grateful
Thank you for being you.
I found the cure but nobody believes Him. It's in one little sentence found in the Bible.  Whenever you pray believe you have received it and you will have it.  Granted most people take this verse out of context.   Jesus loves you man.
just listened to this song wonderful.  I lost my dad 28 years ago to cancer this is the first song than imo brought a strong man to cry. it really touched home and brought out every emotion I had bottled up for all these years and cry.  thank you
There's nothing i can say besides i lose it as soon as he says 3 other people you love are with you, do u wish u had cancer instead of them? Great piece of music, just hits me every time.
And my aunt's mom died of cancer we have the same birthday and I have a friend that we have the same birthday and me and her are the same age my friend
I lost my best friend with cancer I lost my grandpa I lost my nana my grandad my uncle died of heart problems my papa died of old age and Sally died too she's my grandma's dog and my grandpa's dog Lexi died too it was my old dog
2022 anyone
This song helped me through one of the toughest times I have had to endure in my adult life…..you and Nova are two of my favorites.  I love everything you do.  Please don’t stop, we needed someone like you.
Sadly the cure is chemo when there is a better answer but it doesn’t cost anything. Hint h20? Wow just saying if our water 💦 was pure it would not b here. Only a twenty year period b4 science recognized that simple fact. Or do they know already??????)
The People: We need a cure!! Big Pharma: Of course! We are trying our best....(mumbling a patient cured is a customer lost) The People: What was that?? Big Pharma: Nothing, just know we are working on it!
Just thx for this. Love you my man
so many died on cancer  in my fam i hate it  that the rich get  all the best treat ment   and i cant do shitt about it     but i lost my mum and i still hope  all things get better one day
18 years of cancer. You just told it all in a   Few minutes. Thank you.
lost my dad, my oldest and #3 brother to cancer. (I'm youngest and #7) this is a beautiful song.
My mom has stage 4 cancer tom ur an inspiration thank u
Sad thing is....Dr. Sebi found the cure for cancer and are government KILLED him.
I lost my aunt to cancer and I just want to see her and hug her again :( this song brings tears to my eyes man, I just wish they would cure cancer man, lots of people are losing their life to this :( If you have cancer please dont give up you can do it I believe in you and I love you ❤️
posting for awareness, there is a scammer in the comment section of Toms videos:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb_x0IO8tMzt9mHuroECQ4A
RIP to those who fought and Lost to this killer disease theres a cure but this world always has to be about money but yet all the money in the world can't bring back the ones we lost or losing or heal em we just gotta watch hopelessly and helpless as the clock runs out but hey life I guess gotta take the hits an smile
I'm Sorry, But  feel Like TheMedicine they give us is Killing Us Faster!!!
Oh my Jesus, I just realized that the doctor in this video is the teacher from “White Boy”!
Hi Mom!  It is my 50th birthday today.  I remember the last hug you gave me in 1989.  Hugs matter, I can still see and feel it.  I'm sober, you'd be proud I finally am the gentleman you raised.  I miss and love you.  Your loving son...
Beautiful song, I lost my uncle in 2011 from cancer and then, we lost my aunt and grandma 2 weeks apart in 2012 from cancer as well. Cancer takes a toll on everyone it touches. The patient suffers and the family suffers as well.
My 25 year old has lukemia he is 25 years old and has a 2 year old son this is such a great song.
It's a shame they play with our lives and make so much money from it, watched my aunty go through it have a friend with it my sister in law just had her thyroid out and now my husband has been diagnosed with thyroid cancer two months after his sister, they say is hereditary but I wonder if the jab has anything to do with it
This makes me cry so hard. My dad went to Vietnam and agent orange gave him cancer. I had my first birthday party in the hospital. He died two weeks later. Then my Mom married an abusive alcoholic, so no father figure there. I'm just now learning how to be a man. Thank you Tom and everyone involved in what you are doing. You are making such a genuine difference in people's lives. It's so real that it hurts. And makes me feel truly alive
How is this man bad? He motivates the vulnerable, and encourages them to fight. We don’t deserve this, but I am grateful for it. My heart goes out to those who suffer with this, you aren’t alone 🇺🇸❤️
yeah my great grandmother died from burns from the radiation
This shit right hear. I have no words.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I ❤️Tom!
I lost my biological father to pancreatic cancer back in 2018, the doctors didn't catch it until he was in stage 4..... He died right before he turned 42 years old... Here I thought I processed through all the pain, but I am crying as I write this. I needed to hear this song, thank you Tom. My aunt and bf and I are forever your fans, don't stop making music and please please please continue to stay genuine. You got this bro 🤙🏼🇺🇸 God bless you and your girl
This song hits me so hard. I lost my 81yo Dad to cancer less than a month ago. He was diagnosed less than a month before that, but by then, he was already stage 4 and it was in his prostate, lungs, and bones.
Cannabis and a a plant based died is our God given cure I believe 🙏
For anyone to see this going forward there has been a recent study that went through a six month trail using monoclonal antibodies. At the end all participants were in complete remission and cancer cells couldn't be found. As far as I know they are working on trails for a bunch of other types of cancer. Here hoping that there will be no need for chemotherapy or radiation in future.   Far to many lives have have been cut short. To many were not not allowed to happen. All of you are missed, we will never forget you.
William mason 7 tall 280lbs birthday 😞🎉 Jan 16th dad's James mason 😭😭
True truth
Do some research and and look at how many Dr’s came out with a cure and just where so depressed about finding a cure for cancer that they just happened to commit suicide in the woods !! There’s a cure out there and it’s being hidden by big pharma !!!
👍🏻
Just liked the video for the second time. All Tom's song have my like deleted.
thank you for that song. i can relate to it. i lost my father through cancer which caused a stroke. my cousin died of lung cancer and i miss her every day. this song made me cry my heart out.
Honestly really love all of toms music but cancer was the hardest fight I ever went through and this one just idk how to describe crying with a smile but that’s what it does to me a bet Tom could say it better love this
My mon just got diagnosed with lung cancer 1 year if shes Lucky 😢😥😢
R.I.P  To my mom
Went through breast cancer a few years back, still have a few more years before being declared "cancer free". Many of the RNs who were my colleagues also developed breast cancer at about the same time. Coincidence? I'll never believe it! Thank-you to God, my daughter, my friends, some family... and now this song . The changes are hard to deal with. Love you, Tom, for recognizing life's challenges.
i lost my first husband arlis in 93...he was a hard worker and we had two kids together...he treated me and my kids with love and respect....i was told when he had brain cancer that they got it out but later after he died i found out otherwise
I lost my mom and grandpa Lucien to Cancer I miss them so much
Today I lost an uncle I loved to bone cancer
As someone who had a family member who went through this, this song is damn accurate. You think with all the money thrown at cancer, we would have had a cure by now. But all they want to do is treat the symptoms, not the disease which is cancer. I've lost a grandpa, multiple grandmother's, and even my own mother to cancer. And as much as it puts a toll on the Cancer Victim, it puts an even bigger toll on the Survivor relatives and Friends. And let's not even get into the financial burden in order to even try to treat this problem. I have seen so Much Death in my lifetime, that I'm now numb to it. And let me just say survivor's guilt is a bitch. With all the what-if questions, in what could I have done questions, it can be nerve-racking.
The man in Hearts.. TOM MACDONALD ❤️
This is exactly what I have been saying. The cr+ooks in po+wer are p+ure e+vil.
Besides the cur+es kept from us which is a p+roven fa+ct, eating the right fruits, vegetables, and herbs is the best defense. Also, stop eating food spraid with poi+sin. A lot of food is spr+aid with toxi+ns prove+n to cau+se can+cer. The g+ov will not protect us.
Yup, people's lives were dest+royed for bringing real cur+es. Milli+ons mur+dered by big phar+ma/the e+vil g+ov.
Holy Shit! know shit? true shit!
This video hurts but is so truth. It touched a lot of people!
The fifth element is Goddess Of Love
I just found out the other day I have lymphoma at 29 years old 😢
I'm very sorry for anyone who has or will lose a child, spouse, family member, friend, or loved one to cancer. Tom I want you to know that all children go on to be with the Lord after they die because they are innocent and are unable to respond to the gospel of Jesus Christ because of that. Unfortunately being a "good" person won't get you into heaven while there will be people in heaven who may have committed some of the worst evils one could ever do while there body was alive on the earth.  I'd like to give you the reason for that. Jesus who is God manifested in the flesh took the punishment for all of man's sins at once in mankind's place, was buried, and arose to life three days later. We all need to repent of our sins and confess them to Jesus to have the burden of sin removed from us and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ to have our sins washed away and be filled with the Holy Ghost with the initial evidence of speaking in another language we've never heard nor learned before to be accepted of God and be entered into the Kingdom of God and then follow after Christ from henceforth. The only real division there is are those that recieve salvation and keep it until they die and those that don't which determine where one goes when they die. We are all lost in our sins and destined for hell without Jesus living inside of us. I pray that you would come to know the Lord Jesus. This life is temporal and fleeting. Eternity is forever and God is good and loves us so much. We can trust in him when we can't trust anything or anyone else even ourselves because He's trustworthy. Think about it. The same God that created all life and who made both man and woman in His likeness took our place in suffering and death and conquered death, hell, and the grave so that we may recieve life and life more abundantly, even life eternal with Him in heaven. I have a powerful testimony to share if you'd care at all to listen but I don't want any of it to be about me but about what the Lord has done. There is hope beyond the grave but it can only be found in Jesus Christ. Lord bless you Tom and I pray you find your way to truly receive eternal life which is only found in Christ Jesus in Jesus name amen 🙏❤️🫂
Just find out December 2021 that my brother was diagnosed with cancer. It was a hard take for all of us, but this song just makes it better for me. Thank you.
First song of his that made me cry. This hits home. My mom has pancreatic cancer and after going through chemo and radiation there has been no change. She has decided to discontinue treatment and live out the rest of her life the best she can. It's truly heartbreaking
Love and respect. Thank you.
Nope still can't finish this one 😞 Maybe one day but not today
You are awesome and I have a lot of respect for you as a 51 year old women I am a fan
Cure ir? They're probably deliberately causing it. They can't make money off you if you are healthy or dead. Many ailments are demons anyway.
Grandma in law passed from cancer 2 days ago. 3 weeks ago she was perfectly healthy, went to ER with low grade fever and shortness of breath. 2 weeks later she was given 7-10 days. :( she was a Saint and gave me what my biological family never could in 28 years.
The day this song came out my grandpa passed from bone cancer. No liked kn thta omment. Makes me sad nobody has saw it
40 years. Forver wearing ribbons? Maybe 40 years lamow
This makes me tear eyed...I have stopped my treatments after 4 years for NHL, due to losing faith in the medical treatment...this song touches everyone...thank you Tom Mcdonald.
Nach der Germanischen Heilkunde, ist da bereits Heilung in Gange.
I saw your 2yo song and to see those 1yo you look different 🤔🤔 just my thoughts your face looks different
Lymphoma 50 %  diagnosis.. I AM A FIGHYER ! FUCK CANCER
How sad is it that people judge this man so profusely, demonize him and tell him to kill himself simply because of his political views. They refuse to acknowledge how great this man really is and the true pieces of art that he writes such as this one. I think that people are just so sensitive now a days that it doesn't matter how good or genuine you are if you speak the truth or disagree with them they will tell you to kill yourslef and demonize you simply because they got offended over factual science or the truths of the world.
My mom was diagnosed with cancer a couple days before Easter this year
I have twin boys 4 years old this past May... My mother almost died of colon cancer And a great uncle that died of lung cancer... I look at my boys and I hug them and tell them how much I love them every day over and over... I drink I smoke I carry this phone in my back pocket knowing the emf is dangerous I know they could go any day from a fall chasing a puppy in to the road... Life is suffering and loss makes you wonder if this is hell........ Thank you Tom you are truly a good dude I love how you are using your fame and your platform... Bro I love you man I could never keep up but if you ever need a friend I would be yours lol corny right lol..... Thank you brother you are doing GODS WORK I mean that..... Thank you brother
So much respect Tom you are the future you have a heart of gold you deserve to be the best rapper you know what love and life means to everyone in the world respect Tom MacDonald
Aw this made me cry Lost both my mom and dad to cancer  My boyfriend is a cancer survivor  Five years in remission.
one of the best songs ever
My dad died of cancer back in march miss him
Lost my grandma to cancer this past January, it’s been hard but I know she’s praying for me from heaven
I  did a year and half of chemo, 132 treatments and they removed a foot of my colon
My dad's been fighting cancer since Feb 2020 and he just passed away a couple weeks ago (April 2022) after two years of chemotherapy. Miss him every second. When this track dropped, I didn't have the courage to click play. Today I am listening this for the first time.
Damn, what a moving song brother! No money in the cure, you said it! Sure can be a sick world we're livin in...
Facts
Thank you Thomas!  You help a lot of people !
I’m a cancer survivor that dsnt get to be proud of beating it from my own family
ITS FROM ALL VACCINATIONS!!!! Babies are perfectly human it’s the men shooting poison into WE THE PEOPLE the plants of Earth that poison us!!!!
Back in April I just found out I had colon cancer I go in for surgery on 26 May thank you Taplin for having a song explain how we all feel I’ve had this terrible disease and if you do have it just keep fighting you all eventually win
wow
Love this omg I can not say much🥲🥲😘
As a cancer survivor, all I can say is Thank You Tom. I wish I had heard this song earlier in my journey... it was released on YouTube the same month and year I was diagnosed.
Lost my mom to cancer when I was 12 and lost my grandpa to it last year. It never gets easier to watch someone you love suffer.
Please spread the message of "Hydrogen For Health" George Wiseman would be a good starting point, he talks a lot about it, along with many others
Luv luv luv
This song... Yep I get in my feelings... The message is deep it just means that there's people that will give up no matter what and then there's people that will smile through all the hard things in life... When I start doing really good in life there's always something back to back to back to back to break me down.. but I keep going forward
F@ck Tom! How the f@ck do you do it? Just when I think I cannot find another Tom Macdonald song that I can feel, then I come across this song. Tom, you are a gift to all of us. My mother passed away a week after Thanksgiving 2021from cancer. She was given 6 months but fought for 6 years. This song came on my playlist and immediately I stopped to listen and I had to walk away from my job to cry. This song hit me so hard!   Tom, thank you so much for everything you do, every song you put out and the message you send. We love you.  Edit: Tom I wish I could give you a hug and thank you for this song. 🤗
If the girl was another ethnicity or a boy, I bet this video wouldn’t have as many views
My mom died April 31 2021 due to brain and cervical cancer. Thank you for this song.
Exactly TOM..... I know of one Monoclonal Antibody (Leronlimab PRO 140) that is also a CCR5 regulator that has also broken the blood brain barrier...LL Mab was used in HIV clinical trials and actually resulted in ZERO viral load in several patients in a 700+ clinical phase 3 trial with ZERO safety concerns to boot..(No known COVID cases within the trial to boot on folks with severely compromised immune systems.. It also proved effective for COVID but seems the powers above are slow-walking approvals....   Most importantly, It is also in a basket trial for solid tumors as well (breast cancer, etc)....  GOLDEN CHALISE which should be getting funding from the NIH?  No other therapeutic that I know of can state that it has broken the Blood-Brain-Barrier with such safety profile and efficacy to date....
today my father died after 1 year cancer in 2019 mis him
It has been said they’ve had the cure for cancer for 50 years at least, when Trump comes back the cure will be released then it’s judgment time for all the murders.
Hard song to listen to lost my mom to cancer
Aliens don't have hair, because of space radiation?
YouTube won't let me like the video????
damn I needed to find this song
My grandfather and grandmother both died from cancer 11 years apart when I was 15 I prayed so hard and begged God to save my grandfather make him better he god saved in 2000 that march died that June I was so angry I begged him to save him ask and it will be given to you when I was around 28 I almost killed my safe depression had pulled me down I was in that hospital room I got down on my knees and prayed God spoke to me he told me I did everything you asked of me your grandfather is in heaven has a new body feels no pain sorrow and your just mad because I didn’t do it your way. God took all my pain my depression and sorrow away that day and I’ve been seeking him for along time he loves you and me and I love you and anyone who is hurting from the things in life just know someone dose love you be strong keep fighting
Tom thank you for this I have 6 months to live stage 4 Lung cancer, I lost my 1st born son to a drunk driver and I hope I see him again. But I have an 11yr old who don't understand what's going on. Thank you I'm crying like a bitch but THANK YOU AGAIN TOM MACDONALD MUCH LOVE BROTHER
God this song just made me wonder yeah why have they not found a cure for cancer f#$%ing crazy
I lost my son 2 months before he turned 5 to a brain tumor. He would be 31 now and I still struggle to keep my mind and heart right. Thank you Tom for this song. You will touch so many more than you realize.
I have not had cancer, but this song reminds me every time I hear it how precious life is. I am so sorry for all of you who have suffered. 🙏 Lord, have mercy...
Thank you so much for this... I was recently diagnosed with cancer and this song has been so uplifting. It has helped me through a lot mentally and emotionally. Sometimes all we need is someone to tell us "You got this." Thank you <3
💕
As a childhood cancer survivor, Thank You😘❤️
bro i lovev tom
EXCELLENTAY , GREAT GUY , LOVE YA LYRICS AND MUSIC, KEEP POPPIN, ......
my uncle passed away from cancer so this song makes me think of him
No joke this song gives me goosebumps wen I hear this song cuz I lost some very dear family members to cancer.
I recently lost my firend from cervical cancer 😭😭😭
I lost whom I love to cancer and research concluded that those whom are in the 4th &  5th stage of cancer can be cured in the Himalayan and/or Mexico...  WTF... why would the US Govt refuse healing herbs/knowledge into the US...oh...its called profit $$$$$
As awful as it is, there's actually a reason we haven't cured cancer yet.  It's because there isn't just one big bad cancer.  They're all different and what works on one type might not work on another.   So in short, cancer is a right bastard.
My mom loved this song but she gone now she is my guardian angel
MY FATHER IS A VICTIM OF CANCER THE FDA SHOT DOWN THE CURE LOVE YOU TOM SPEAK FOR THE VOICELESS YOUR STRENGTH AND HONOR IS RESOUNDING AROUND THE WORLD AND I WONT QUIT TILL IM SIX FEET UNDER PROMOTING YOUR MUSICAL MOVEMENT
Thank you for the truth told to the public
This song hits hard on every level. Thanks for your message in your music, you are pure talent , keep on keeping on 👍
more than likely more than 1 way to beat cancer. I'd look into Ivernemectin, Ozone, sodium bicarbonate for alkalinity, and Freqency vibrations to target them. These are the paths i've heard many people take with great success.
I know all to well the pain and anger of losing your heart, your wife to cancer. This video was hard to watch but it spoke so much truth. Thanks Tom
Yur tha BEST 👌
You nailed the medical system, I have no respect for specialist doctors, so disillusioned. My GP is great but the ride the experts have taken me on is criminal 💜
I have cancer...Stage 4 .use no pain meds...alone,robbed,stalked and had my infant stolen...Clarksburg,Wv...ty Tom..You r a True Angel.Love,THE ORIGINAL DARKANGEL...LORI A.RICHARDS....SHINN
🔥 😥
I had bladder cancer in 2021 had surgery  12 treatments. Started juicing vegetables best nutrition you can do to build you immune system .My heart go out to all affected by cancer. Change you dite and you will be stronger have more energy. Juicing is the answer
lost my daddy to cancer... hardest thing ever
I love this song.. you are awesome. It's hard watching people who have to fight cancer
Dr Burzynski in Texas has had a cure for cancer since the 60s & drug companies worked with FDA to try & shut him down. Only thing he can do is clinical trials, he's had the cure for cancer for decades. FDA AND OTHERS know it & can't make money off of it. his specific formula is all natural and it works
dry fast !! cures all
I can't believe I'm just now seeing this guy....hes literally amazing ....even the things I don't agree with are well stated .......this guy needs to be on the radio
We're in God's Hand's.  Please don't give up!
i love this guy.
Real truth💯💯
What’s worse that Tom hasn’t talked about is the fact most of us have never lived. We had a few hype moments that didn’t last long. We’re stuck in a bubble, a glass ceiling. We’re stressed having to work 40 hours minimum to provide for ourselves and our families, doing whatever it takes putting our morals aside, never making enough money to fulfill our passions and our dreams. We were dying from the day we were born. I would take 40 years of living than 100 years of life.
Thank You cause driving alone sucks & thieft  on weak makes you need a "break room".... guess asking God for advice is better then cocky pragers that takes your abilites  but not wisdom after FuFightighting
Tom MacDonald, I love you so much, thank you for this song and my name is Ben
"You don't realize what you can take,  til you realize you didn't break"- Tom Macdonald that's going in the quote book
I lost an aunt to Cancer.  My Nephew (he just turned 10!)  has been growing out his hair to donate to cancer patients.
I went to my Junior Prom with a girl who was diagnosed with lymphoma. She was the strongest person I ever met. I lost touch with her and it's a tragedy that in this day and age such a young beautiful person is lost. We can and should do better.
Hi cured 95% of all cancer on the diagnosis. Too scared tho to bring it out. Gots sweet all backing  .
Again i say WOW Absolutely Amazing True Blue Patriot and a Roll Model to say the least... Ya a God sent with ya love and excellent videos and Music !!! WOW !!!
I can relate I got kidney cancer. Only early stage but with covid it slowed everything down for surgery . It scares the shit out big me I'm only 35 and got two teenage kids. Thank you for this song
Just started listening this artist and I can't stop love is message
Please eat all organic foods, milk and honey that are only "pasturized" and stop taking prescription meds. Look to nature. God and Mother Nature put everything we need to sustain life and health growing up from the earth. I am a walking, living testimony. I am a cervical cancer warrior and my daughter is 2 years post op warrior from a pancreactomy(pre cancerous mass in tail) and spleenectomy. She was 25 then.  They are killing you through the foods as well. Chemicals in and on your foods, gmo's, antibiotics....just say no.
Tom do you ever go by Tommy Mc D
Found Tom through Mac Lethal, decided to stay when I dove into his discography and found that Tom really has a heart that's so fucking hard to find these days.
fighting stomach cancer grandma fighting cancer grandma like the song too she said  " I love song! So for real. And it's right, all I can do is fight and hope for something better waiting!👵💜For now I have all of you to talk & walk with💖and LOVE💜💜💜💜💜💜💖💖💜💜"
I have breast cancer. They did the radiation treatment at work. Now I have to go through chemo. I want to say thank you to you and nova for making this song. It gave me the strength to fight
I can't recall any other song about cancer, so I can't really compare this to any other. But as someone who was diagnosed with cancer 15 years ago, this is a very accurate song. Even made me cry a little.
Thank you for this! You are a legend ! I love you!! ❤️
I have CLL CHRONIC LYMPHATIC LUKEKEMIA noI CURE APPARENTLY I TOLD THEM TO FCK THE CHEMO IM 45 I HAVE A 21 YR OLD DAUGHTER 24 UR OLD SON AND 4 YR OLD GRANDCHILD A BEAUTIFUL HUSBANDD TO BE IM LUCKY THAT THEY CAN KEEP THIS AT BAY LONGER THEN MOST TYPES   I BLAME MYSELF BC IM A ADDICT TOO ITS LIKE A KICK IN THE TEETH CUZ I WANTED TO GET CLEAN  BUT WOTS THE POINT  .

ANYWAY TOM CLASS TUNE MAN.LOVE FROM PLYMOUTH UK.,
Cancer is no joke!! I'm 54 years old and I've worked hard all of my life. I did 10 years in the US Army, paid my  own way through college and earned two degrees. And In just 8 short months I went from a strong man with great work ethics, to a weak frail man who has missed more work in that short period of time, than in the 43 years prior. I was diagnosed with stage 2 bladder cancer, went through chemotherapy, and just 3 weeks ago, had my bladder, prostate, and some lymph nodes removed. Two weeks after this major surgery, I've gone back to work. But I'm so far behind on everything that I fear I that I am going to loose everything I have worked so hard to get. If it weren't for the strength of my wife, and the lyrics in your song, especially the four lines near the end of the song, I probably would have just given up. The doctors say that they got all of the cancer, but I am still scared. I'm scared that it will come back. And if it does, I don't know if I will have the strength to go through all of this again. Regardless of what happens, this song is my anthem. I listen to it everyday, at least once, but most days, several times. Thank you Tom. I'm so glad I found your music, but more importantly, this song "Cancer".
Cancer can't grow if you maintain your bodies Ph level to alkaline. But if your body is in acidic state cancer thrives sickness thrives.
My mother was diagnosed with cancer and given 3 months to 2 years to live. She died 4 weeks later…. Hopefully our world governments will do the right thing and give us what we need to beat it because it does exist
Mom just got diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She's the strongest, most stubborn person I know. I know she'll beat this!
God bless you Tom & family.
This song really touches me, I was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia a year ago. So thank you for this.
Glad to see Fighters still fighting. Us Survivors are with you!
I love this song I recently found out that my uncle has several different types of cancer I sent this song to him to lift him up
Cancer: "You don't know how many I've taken down!" My Sister: "You don't know He who is in me". Same Cancer today: ........ My Sister today: "I tried to warn you..."
Thank you Tom. I was 36 when I was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer and non Hodgkin's lymphoma. Did the chemo treatments and they removed over 2 feet if my colon.  I am 6 foot 5 and weighed 225 before I got sick. When I finally went to the doctor I weighed 125 lbs. I fought back and was cancer free until they found a spot on my liver. They removed almost a third of my liver and my last chemo was the end of July. It has ruined my body. I'm miserable every day of my life but it's worth it just to have one more day to see my kids grow on up. Maybe get to see grandbabies I hope. I'm going to keep fighting until I can't go anymore. Thank you.
Now it's over 120 billion..is it for the patients? Or just lining the pockets? We give money to help cure cancer but it's sadly too big of a money scandle..they make too much money to solve it
WOW!!!  Lost my paternal grandparents, my Dad and Mom to cancer.  My son fought and survived Hodgkins Lymphoma.  You put my anger and frustration at the medical profession and big pharma into words and set them to music😵 Just WOW!!!
😢
#livingwithcancer #fightingthegoodfight #survivor Keep speaking your truth Tom. Blessed be
If listening to this don't make a tear want to fall then you ain't right. Hats off young brother. From a man in the south who lost family to cancer. Don't know why it took so long to find your music. Damn sure glad I did
Cuba found the cure for cancer it's called chromovax how its works is it starves the proteins that allow cancer to eat your body
Big pharmaceutical doesn't want to cure cancer...they make too much money in treatments that DESTROY the human body.  My brother was one of the first survivors of testicular cancer, he was one of two people that they found the treatment they used and still use some of today. If my brother wouldn't have been built like a brick house there is NO way he would have survived. They have treatments for cancer that has been blocked by the FDA because the drug companies are in bed with government to make pharmaceutical companies rich and for government organizations to get under the table money.   My dad was a doctor and practiced medicine for 54 years and he said "Doctors don't practice medicine anymore, pharmaceutical companies and government practices medicine."
Cancer survivor here.     This is my song Thanx for this
This song is the ultimate tribute to people that are battling cancer. I am very blessed not to have anyone in my family that is going through this terrible disease. But when I listen to these words this grown man begins to cry.
We will all die. Just be strong my guys
The humanity
fukn garbage and lies that they hide the cures for cancer from us still. it's good money to have us rotting away and dying.
WOW THAT'S BIG 1 TOM MOM DAD BOTH PASTED AND NOW I JUST FOUND OUT THAT MY PIT HAS IT BREAKING WHAT HEART  I HAVE LEFT I REALLY WISH THAT THEY COULD DO ANYTHING FOR HUM ONLY ANSWER IS TAKE HIM OUT OF HIS MISSERY 😭
Man just when I think I have heard every Tom Mcdonald song.. This one hits home hard..
This song always hit me in my core... my niece/ God daughter was diagnosed at the age of 4 with AML leukemia and she fought so hard for 3 years before she lost her battle 3/4/16 💔 😢 😔 and this song was so her well she fought she was so strong and always worried about all of us and would tell us don't worry about me I got this you got get better that's all i want cuz your a fighter just like me ❤💯 thank you for this song Tom ❤💯
thank you Tom!
God i love this song!!!!
Lost my Wife 8 months ago to Breast cancer that moved to her brain
Check into the RSO oil everyone I heard it works wonders not too many people know about this because they don't want people to know because they'll put them out of business do your research I heard it's legal in a lot of states and you can get it  a lot of dispensaries have it except the UK and I wish I would have known about this sooner before my dad passed at age 56 from stage 5 colon cancer if this RSO cannabis oil can save lives they should legalize it everywhere God bless everyone know that we're fighting with you 🥰❤️🙏💪
Sadly you only to start to take cancer serious and care about it as soon as someone in your family is affected. My mom failed chemo and has received Car-T therapy 2 months ago. Waiting on the next scans/results is driving us all crazy. I wish this situation to no one, not even my worst enemies. Prayers and best wishes for everyone who reads this and might need it.
I am so relieved to hear the words being sung out loud!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey Tom this song I listen to almost daily as my father has cancer now so I can feel the message you're sending
😥
This song hit me I lost my grandfather to lung cancer and my father is in remission from leukemia and I see how much damage the "medication" did to him its so sad all this research and funding but can't figure out a better way to fight it #FUCKCANCER love your music man and thank you for this song
This is one of my favorite songs from Tom McDonald and I hope he'll do more songs like this in the future to try to help everyone that we can and let them know we are fighting with them! Awesome song! Love it! ❤️🙏💯🔥💪👍
They have cures! They don't make money to cure it! They make money to draw it out...
Speak it brother. This one made me want to cry... NEVER FORGET. YOU & OTHER HAVE THE SUPPORT. JUST ASK...
My best friend lover died from cancer Lauren Latour 12/23/89    0718 2020  29 years only  I miss her Thank you Tom I need ed that song
Chemo is sold for five grand. The Drs charge 10times that. I do want to leave this place. This is the devil's world. I'm ready to go home praise the creator
Tom is a man of the People of this World. Thank you for sharing your Emotions and your Truths. Such Talent. Greatest Artist of all Time. Love you
Just lost my big brother to cancer/liver disease this Valentine's day, this song hit me way too hard😭 rest in heaven Kunzie, give mom a hug n a kiss for me💜
My mom's going into surgery Tuesday to remove one of her breast..and she's got Cancer in other spots has to do Chemo and Radiation after for how long I shall find out soon..I 100% believe my mother will win. My faith is strong God will Heal .. I've been giving her turkey tail capsules too read about that and cancer when you take em along side chemotherapy it's amazing this medicinal mushroom has been studied by the Government and its proven now
"You won't know how to be brave till you choose to fight when you're afraid,  And you don't experience strength till you struggled to carry the weight; You won't know why you have faith till you look the Devil in his face,  And you won't know what you can take till you've realised you didn't break."     What a great lyrics!!!
Thank you so much for this song!!! My aunt loves your music like I do but she does have cancer with a 35% survival rate. She takes comfort listening to this. Such a great team
Cancer will never be cured until we stop making Pharma rich off our sicknesses...  Sincerely, a daughter of a Mom battling liver and colon cancer......
I lost my mom to stage 4 colon cancer in 2015. She was definitely a damn fighter! They think she had it easily for 5-7 years undetected and she survived another 4 years with chemo. It’s going to be 7 long years without her on April 22nd. I love you mommy!💕
Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you so much for making this song man
Two time brain cancer patient brought to tears. All evil is a cancer.
I just lost my grandpa 3 weeks ago to stage 3 lung cancer   Just wanna say I listen to everyone of your songs keep going and keep pushing forward and reach to the ones that need to hear your thoughts and music thank you so much for the inspiring music Tom!
This brought tears to my eyes. If u lived with someone who has cancer to hear someone express the fight. Thank you Tom
They are hiding the cures. The motherfuckers..
Hey Tom McDonald I just want to tell you thank you so much for standing up for what the truth really is about in our sick greedy ass world! You are courageous and your my personal hero for being so courageous! Every single word you speak is right on the facts about the cancer industry. If I’m not mistaken the Best natural cure for cancer is vitamin B 17 also known as Laetrile, you can find it in capsule form at most mom and pop health food/ organic stores, I do need to let you know a note of caution for the buyer just in case you’re not aware of this, the medical industry, big Pharma, a the FDA literally own The word cure they have actually patented that word, so therefore anything natural that you can buy that you don’t need a prescription for is going to have a disclosure on it that says the following, not intended to diagnose cure or prevent any disease and they have to put the disclosure on there because of the laws so do not be discouraged against that since it is literally against the law for any company to let you know the intended use to cure some thing or a specific disease with something natural that they make and that’s pretty messed up but that’s our screwed up system. I’m going to also paste the link to the documentary called “The Cancer Report” by those at Healthwyze.org, note that you will need to read this video but it’s so imperative the information that it’s worth every second to read it, also all the most potent natural cancer cures know. To man are all listed somewhere near the end of the documentary (I’m not in any way associated with healthwyze.org or any documentaries that they make,I’m just a good person who’s trying to share the years of research I’ve done on cancer). Here’s the link https://youtu.be/WnaBG177VIw
Drink 1 cup of hot water with 1t baking soda and 2 T maple syrup 2x a day to kill cancer.Also Essiac herbal cancer cure ,cut off sugar and eat organic no genetically altered plants or grains and use honey. PRAY to Yahovah our God in the name of Yashuah Messiah ask for help because he has all power and might. Worked for me and my family members.
so sweet and real, and encouraging
My mom died of breast cancer, worst thing I've ever gone through. She was only 50 years old. She made it to her last birthday and we made sure to celebrate it with joy, even tho it was painful. Her death made me a stronger person I know that for sure. And cancer will always effect me emotionally.   Everything he says, nailed it. 100% truth! I didn't want to listen to this song. I avoided it. But I know I needed to hear what he said. Can't help but make you cry.  Tom we love you. Your music hits people in a different way ( good way ) that's for sure. Your truly special. ❤
It's more profitable to treat a patient than cure them.
My baby sister passed on 2 yrs. ago from "C"....she fought for 6 long hard yr.! I will never let them give me chemo or radiation to poison my body make sicker loss to extend my life for little more time with NO quality of life. Making my family take care me
I have a rare cancer and this song hit my heart
Almost a year with ALL leukemia. Just found this song,  thank you, Tom.  I mean it.
💯💯🔥🔥🎼🎼🎼  #teamgems .😥😥❤❤
Finally someone who sings the truth !
I lost my mom in 2010... this shit is terrible. Glad there's people like Tom pushing to support the brave people that wake up to face cancer daily. Thank you Tom 🙏
And all those who try to bring the cures suddenly get suicidal 😓 the attack on Gaia 😭😭😭😭😭
😓😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢
My mom just got diagnosed..I'm gonna do everything to Save my Momma
It is forbidden to recommend Chlorine Dioxide Solution  for cancer treatment. It would ruin the pharmaceutical indu$try. Better make that stuff yourself than buy it (otherwise you don't know what you get)..it's pretty easy and cheap. Excuse my 'english skills'... Best wishes to everyone from Germany Love & Peace
Thank you so much brother
i always said there is a cure. can cure other thing in months of research but 40+ years and can't with cancer weird hmmm, my dad when was 11 died of it and my step dad
As a person who not only watched and lost loved ones I am also a cancer patient that developed from products this song both destroyed and gave me hope because I know they keep stuff from us my surgery was 168,000 dollars chemo for 1 cycle was 6,800 I had 6 cycles not to mention all the scans every 3 months yes the medical industry makes a killing on killing us The chemo is rough I had to do 4 different meds at 1 cycle! I’ve been putting off listening to this because I have 3 tumors they are watching my doctor told me it’s not an if it comes back it’s a when because of the type of Cancer i was diagnosed with it was Ovarian Carcinosarcoma such beautiful word but very ugly consequences with it, I still to this day walk with God because I’m hoping and praying that when it’s my time that there is a heaven and that’s where I will be going (yes I believe there is) but Thank you for this song and bringing truth to one of the most egregious lies about cancer and the other is what they do to children! Tom you have made a huge fan full of love for you by your words and your fighting spirit I never liked rap or hip hop until You, Nova, Adam, Struggle Thank you for every word every song and May Jesus bring you Love Comfort and Peace, I’ve been cancer free for 6 years now but still have those nasty tumors liver,kidney and colon but worst of it my sister Told me yesterday that she has it also not same as mine not in same place but she has it! Prayers to all Much Love sent to all of you too! 👊🏻❤️🙏🏻🥰
I can't expess my feeling everytime i listen to this song. It touched my heart 🥺
I'm a child cancer survivor and I would've been dead at 8 years old had my parents not refuses the experimental treatment and/or had I been born in the US. I'm Canadian. This is the truth.
Bro I didn’t like ur music but as I dig deeper I’m becoming a fan, you have a voice, so.. KEEP SPEAKING. Peace.
once you are in the medical profession, you will realize that we are also only human and there are no cures for many diseases,  Yet, we have to try and we therefor try our best tools that we have.....at this time. ( Still, love you Tom)
Deep
F U C K Y E S T O M !
This song hits me everytime(All facts added!!!). "Pray there's something after this" Strong hit!
I just lost my dad to cancer. A week ago tomorrow.  Tom... I've listened to this song so many times in my past year of being a fan.  But it hits so much harder now. It has helped me to get the tears out instead of shutting down. I hope you read this... your helping me out so much right now. Thanks you Tom, thank you Nova.  HOG4LIFE
In general i hate most all rap music. But Tom MacDonald is a special person. And not only do I agree with most of what he is saying, but actually enjoy listening to most of his music. Fanatic musician!
Love u man keep up the good work so much truth in what you say
You're a fucking  lyrical genius 🌸
Thanks Tom my mom lived and fought cancer for six months
Thank you!
Tom my father has stage 4 brain cancer I have been struggling to stay strong an positive for him  your music helps me cope and stay strong for him thank you for making your music it helps me a lot
you tube keeps removing my like of your mesage
Love this song my dad died of cancer very touchy
My mom died of brain cancer (Glioblastoma Multiforme) in October of last year. She was diagnosed in May. This song kept me positive even though we knew death was Imminent, and quick. She was healthier than anyone I know. I miss her daily and it feels like it’s been years already, barely 5 months since. I plan to one day work in hospice and I know the pain that comes with it, but I was put through it for a reason. I couldn’t imagine being a parent of a terminal cancer patient. Losing a mom was all I could manage to imagine.
This is deep
Found this song today and today is my one since finding out about my tumor/cancer. Such a great song and really hits hard. Seeing the girl in the video fighting brain cancer(say that cause the scare on the right side of her head) broke me even more cause I also have brain cancer…
I’m fighting brain cancer. This touched my heart 😔
Ganja kills Cancer.... But then what is Cancer when EVERY F-ING sickness in 2020 was COVID.... Doctors like to kill people now-a-days... Eat good and use Cannabis Oil  and Prey to Yah (God).... BlessUp y'all
I was diagnosed 4 years ago with Stage IV Plasmablastic Lymphoma, a rare and aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. It was supposed to be incurable and I was supposed to have died in 2018. The Chemo I had was V-EPOCH and it almost killed me before the cancer. I then had to endure a Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplant. I don’t wish what I had to endure on my worst enemy. If I had known what I was going to go through and the damage to my body the Chemo was going to do, I would have never went through it.
Lost my daughter on July 20, 2020. She was a fighter but the all the crap they pumped into her was what did her in.  She said she wouldn't have went thru it all but if I gave her just one more day with her son then it was worth it. RIP now my sweet Destiny Rose.  So true on the words of this song.
Same ole same ole ttrammets for over 50 years baby brother just turned 48 the C got him I miss him like crazy ....
I lost my dad to colon cancer when I was 17 when he was a child he was exposed to agent orange and that's what the doctors think started his skin cancer that and to much sun exposure but then they did the surgery they thought all the cancer filled limph nodes but they didn't. Then Xmas of 2010 my father tried to hide it coughing blood up. Then in turned into stomach cancer then to colon cancer. I fell apart that night at the hospital left job corps due to my family emergency. August 2nd, 2011 at 4:55am my father passed away. He was ONLY 33 he was fighting his hardest but now it runs in my family. I was raped at 23 and now have my death warrant signed cancer is going to get me to cause the doctor says my chances are way higher to get and or pass from cancer now that I  contracted HPV
Vaccine equals 💰, never forget that!
You are stronger than this world! Thank you TMac
tears are flowing
I had stage 4 metastasized cancer in my abdomen found Dec2019. It's gone today; don't give up hope, it can happen.  Oddly, it didn't bother me so much, I went through surgery that was like cleaning a fish, chemo and did not give it all my attention. A gift of God I think, because I have anxiety and tend to worry about everything. Except that.  I have no idea why I was saved (as of now, not over yet, still on watch and that chemo port is still under my skin), but others aren't and those people break my heart.  Tom, thank you for this song.  And ladies, please don't avoid those pain in the ass yearly exams we're supposed to have.
Just when I thought I had heard my favorite Tom Mcdonald song.  Dude. I ain't crying
My dad died of it in January. I could have help him with my knowledge in natural remedies, but they rather listen to the doctors who knocked them broke and turned him into a guinea pig.. I pray for all who has loved ones or who have it themselves.. Please research natural remedies...
Rest in heaven to my dad that passed away in 2012 to cancer. I still go through depression and ptsd from it. Prayers to those that have cancer or have family members with it I pray they beat it 🙏🏾
I was in the medical field for more than 25 years I work for hospice 46 and in the song you're singing you don't know how real that is I experienced their last week's hours days and minutes and become friends with everyone it's heavy on my heart but I'm doing good and I feel good by myself and Tom you're the first rapper I really ever listen to to me you just another form of rock and roll
Our ootus had a cancer research grant charity that used every cent given for pay roll n parties then claims hes going to give us a cure for cancer. I say pharma be all hauled into a federal court under oath n be made to tell what they have to end cancer n if they've held back those meds they be cuffed n jailed
My hero ❤
They can't make $$$ off of healthy people
Who is Dr. Hulda Clarke, M.D. and author of many books including A Cure For All Cancers and A Cure For All Diseases
I lost my dad to renal (kidney) cancer 4 years ago. My mom is going through chemo for pancreatic cancer at the moment. I did hospice for him and am nursing my mom. This song hits me hard. Big supporter of your work
im a man that sends st judes. i think we are about
I truly believe they have the cure but will never release it. I mean, think of all the money they will lose, the amount would be insane. Big Pharma and Government, truly evil.
Thought all id find from you was political...i like the political but now im getting into your other side.  with you 100 on the belief they are hiding the cures to extend the profits.   aslo chasing waterfalls when the answer comes from the kids.  lost a 7 yr old sis to dipg.  a cancer that only kills children.  it has a 0% survival rate due to its location on the brain stem.  Didnt stop the docs from collecting hundreds of thousands from my fam and gov in false hopes.  people will give up everything physical to save a family member and most of these docs dont give a hoot about exploiting it.   There are some shining lights in the field of misery.  Ive nothing but positive things to say about St. Jude's.  A great many doctors have stated if they can figure out how to cure dipg they could cure all cancers.  but you dont see any drives for dipg like you do breast cancer and others.  Anyways, keep being real.  Its why i listen to you and others like you.
this is still one of the best!
Thanks Tom,  2 time cancer survivor 1st time 20 years old.  Second time 35 yrs old now 43 years old 🙏🙏🙏
I had cancer and I'm in remission this song hits so hard thank you for investing in showing the pain! Tom you have shown so much love! thank you!
Lost my dad just passed two years on march 9th he passed to lung cancer. I was his caregiver.
My dad died with cancer😞😞😞
I miss you grandpa you was the only dad i very know
I just discovered your music , bless you
This song made me cry. My dad was just diagnosed with lung cancer, but thankfully it's very early on & it's still small, only 2cm.  He's having surgery on 3/15 to remove 35% of his right lung (the upper lobe) & several lymph nodes. If the pathology report says the lymph nodes are not cancerous he won't need any more treatment but if they are, he might have to do radiation & possibly chemo. This surgery is said to be one of the most painful surgeries because they have to bend the right side of the rib cage out of the way so he'll be in the hospital for about a week. Please pray for him.   I'm so scared, I can't lose my dad. He's my rock, he always has been. And being a single mom, he's always been there for my kids, too. I can't imagine him not being here anymore. 😔
One of his best songs how does it only have 3.4 million views should be 20x that
Wish saw this song sooner.. Just beat lung cancer with no support no job no family no help but my 15 y r old son.. T u keep ur music coming
That song choked me up.
My dad has lung cancer.. I still remember the day the doctor told my dad & I..  Felt like my heart shattered 💔. I dropped to the floor & cried! My dad is my best friend & hero. He is a Vietnam Veteran. He was around agent Orange. They didn’t tell the people around it back then that it was POISONOUS ☠️! So many people have died, have cancer, COPD, etc that was around it.  My dad started taking THC/CBD oil & smokes. The treatment wreaked havoc on my dads body. He had his right upper lobe take out & was at the Huntsman Cancer Hospital for almost a month! There was a time we thought we were going to lose my dad, but he pulled through! When he came home he was skin & bones. He’s doing better now… the treatment kills people! They don’t want you to know there is a cure & they have it. Sick people make them money. My dad eats healthier, looked into holistic healing, & he lives every day like it’s his last. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH DAD!
Thanks Tom. I hope you read this. I took care of my mom for over a year when I was "supposed" to be getting ready to go to college. I didn't do any of that. She needed me. They gave my mom six months and she lasted eighteen. "They" killed her. You already know. Thanks man.
Thank you for speaking on all many wont...your music I amazing
This shits home for me😔😭 I lost my grandpa, mom and mother in-law all to cancer. It sucks. Thank you for this video.
My little brother finishes his radiation treatment in a few days. He was 15 years in the clear and then doctors spotted something. I listen to this song everyday and think about him. He truly is a fighter and never let this hold him back. Still went to school everyday like nothing was going on. Hoping this is the last time this curse visits him. Thank you Tom for making such a powerful song. I have chills everytime I listen to it.  ❤
This song hits hard like a brick wall! You got this grandma your a fighter!
RE: treating your cancer "Not medical advice. Consult with your doctor." Do your own research. What I would do if I had cancer: 1 pound of cannabis flower consumed over 4 - 5 months ($300 - 400 per month) has shown very promising results (run from the cure documentary) reversing advanced stage cancer. Other treatments I would consider if I had cancer: Vitamin D: - to strengthen and modulate immune function.   - Safe sun exposure: 30 - 45 min of full body, mid-day sun exposure 5 days per week. During weeks with no sun exposure,, take 10000 iu vitamin D for no more than 3 weeks. Then 5000iu daily after. - get blood work every 6 months to be sure  Vit. D is 60 - 100 ng/dL.  - Low Protein diet: No animal products. No protein powders, or foods high in protein such as beans, lentils, peas.  - Avoid added sugar. - cancer feeds on sugar.  - gcMAF therapies: Bravo probiotic.  - vitamin C: 2000 mg every 2 hours.  - juicing vegetables daily.  - Sodium bicarbonate: orally (check correct dose) - to alkalize the body. Take away from food - 2 hours to not neutralize stomach acid needed for digestion. - OR - 1.5 - 2 cups in a bath for 20-30 min 5 days per week.  Eat organic foods.  Bentonite clay body mask or bath - to absorb toxins: full body mask - 30 min., then shower. OR bath - Add 2 cups to bath for 30 min. - 3 - 5 days per week. Digestive detox: Activated charcoal: 8 - 10 caps daily - away from food and sodium bicarb.:  4 - 5 days per week. "Not medical advice. Do your own reasearch" Don't wait. Start NOW.
I was fucking working Wednesday and I’ve been having some issues breathing and sleeping I thought it was a pneumonia so I kept trying to push it off cuz I needed the money supposed to get married June 11th. My fiancé basically made me go to the ER. Within 5 hrs they have me in an ambulance going to Roswell where they started me on chemo, a blood transfusion and a bone marrow biopsy. I have leukemia I can’t leave here 4-6 weeks then do another bone marrow biopsy to see if I need a bone marrow transplant or more chemo. I was living a normal life less than a week ago looking forward to getting married now I don’t know if I’ll ever even b getting out of here. They said it’s lucky I came cuz I  would have been dead within a week. My whole life is now flipped upside down they say I won’t b able to work a full year if everything goes good and disability doesn’t pay anything. I had 10 times the white blood cells I was supposed to have and half as many red blood cells I was supposed to have. I’m rambling on my bad I’ll stop It’s just crazy how life can change so quickly
My grandmother had lung cancer and because she had three tumors in her lungs she refused treatment..she was so scared to leave and it’s so sad to say that she suffered she put me as her emergency person that makes the decision to help her go easily…doctors didn’t realize till the last day that the reason why the meds wasn’t working completely was because the veins busted and that’s why she screamed everytime…the only thing that calmed her was me talking to her they gave her morphine and three other harder doses of three other medications every 20 min and nothing worked I left the room for 10 min and she died…I can’t forgive myself for not being there when her soul left…I feel so much agony I miss my nanny so much she was painting her nails the night before  her insides exploded they didn’t know what happened they said maybe her hernia and lack of oxygen and blood made her go somewhere else mentally she was literally just fine…it’s crazy living your whole life to just die that way man….
This song speaks so much love with the truth. Epic Lyrical Master dude
Pops died 2 months ago from cancer just hearing this thanks
You don't know how much you can take till you realize you didn't break. As a spinal cord injury survivor with a spinal cord stimulator implant and chronic pain sufferer this really screams to my soul.  @tom would you be okay if I got this line as a tattoo?
This song deserves more views.
😇Winning 🕯️ The🙏 Lost At ☔All Cost!!! 🕊️🙌💬🎳🦠👆EPs and Mixtapes 🙏😇
I'm 14 years old with brain cancer, I 100% agree with this song.
My cousin died to cancer 4 years ago. It's sad because I didn't know him all that much.
Tom, this was quite beautiful. I lost my mom. Not from cancer but your lyrics surrounding fighting, being strong, and the med industry are so well written
Loosing my mother, daughter, grandmother, father to cancer really sucked. But idk why I'm still standing when I went through worse then all of them. But still fighting
Two time survivor thank you for this song so much truth to it
This song made cry Strength is in us all
I’m in tears,  Thank you Tom!
Thanks for this.  15 year survivor here.
I’m blessed today to be able to say my fiancé who was diagnosed 4 months in our relationship with stage 4 brain is now 2 years cancer free. Keep fighting because there can be a life after
As I'm typing this on Mar.2.2022 at 10:00 pm I was just hit with the news my grandma has passed within 2 hrs of this post. I just want to say I love you grandma and thank you for the great times we had together till we meet again..
This sounds like all are family feeling thanks for your words tom love 💘
This song is so full of facts and hope and pain and strength, and touches so many who hear it. I lost a few family members and friends to this horrible illness. 😥
my dad  now me cancer sucks love your song hit me hard tonight i needed this
I'm sorry but it's bad out there lolzzzzzzzz
Thank you for having heart brother
Tom thank you brother for your words and heaven is definitely real I've already been there much love ooooooxxxxxxssssss
MY Dad Died Jan 21 2022 of Canser </3
Great song Tom! My gf died of cancer last year. To extend her life just a little meant giving a lot, its job security  Doctors are not in it to save lives and they fool their patients with using the word "Care" as their label.  Caring is spending all of your savings and never giving up. Caring is looking out for the lost loved ones family. That is why we will always be better than the government/doctors
After finding my wife has  cancer and went through chemo, I guess my life wasn't getting any better just found out a best friend now has to go through it. Stand Strong for all of them!
this is so very true. bravo bravo
My mom had Cancer. Thank god she survived😪 2024 and the cancer is back...
Cancer got worse through Nuclear testing/accidents irradiating the planet. Always look to the richest charities for the things they 'won't' cure.
Imagine only 1 cancer society getting all that money instead of 100k societies!
Tom McDonald for president!!!!
Tom man. Thank you bro. You have me something I didn't know I needed until after finding your music.
Tom. Wow just wow. Amazing song.  This gave me goose bumps! I lost my mom to cancer in 2016. This song has so much meaning. Tom you are a legend! Im a huge fan forever.
Tom, thank you. Been #HOG for years got all your albums. Always loved this song. 42 and just finished my first chemo treatment this morning. I love you brother🤟🏻🔥
Protect Tom!
When will we ALL wake up and fight the bull$hit system that is milking/killing us?  The companies that own cereals, food, seeds/plants, and medical products are poisoning us from day ONE to our last day?  We have all been brainwashed; and are all sheep from our tell-a-vision PROGRAMMING; as well as being indoctrinated from public school systems.

I love this song. It's very personal. I fought cancer and kicked It's ass. I'm also a parent to a child who fought cancer as well. Thank you for making this song.
Tom thank you for doing this song. im a cancer survivor and i love this song.
Keep it 💯 bro you da best tom
LOVE YOU TOM LOVE FROM SCOTLAND
My brother passed away at 11yo. He was in remission but the chemo killed him. Cardiac arrest and fluid filling the lungs. Such a hard fight he fought. Miss my BLT.
Not sure if this is the place for this but apricot seeds will cure cancer. I’ve heard too many stories from good people for it not to be true.
Thank you Tom and Nova!! My Dad died of cancer and some of my other family too so I hold this song close to my heart!! 💕
Just beautiful...
I watched my sister  die  the doctor she had was using the drugs  made in China  knowing they didn't  work but were cheaper  than the real ones so to hell with  establishment
Cancer is vulnerable between 100,000 Hz. And 300,000 Hz. Using a reasonite frequency device two frequencies the same one high one low but the high tuned to thee 11th harmonic. Shattering cancer one cell at a time .
Please spread my word man it needs to spoken to the masses contact me
I listen to this song all the time.im a cancer survivor myself thanks Tom
Honey they have a cure the sad part is they make to munch money treating the symptoms not the disease if you want to cure and you can afford it North Korea they don’t charge for medical keep fighting Freedom isn’t free God bless USA
Absolutely wow
As a survivor this song breaks me everytime i hear it ...... Thank you 💖 #HOG for life
Yup. I am sure you are right about a cure and everything.   Dr. Loraine Day, a doctor who got cancer, did not want to do the typical treatments, because they are so harmful, so she did a lot of research and made a program that cured her of her cancer. She wrote a book and made a video called "Cancer doesn't scare me anymore". Some people have smeared her, but I saw her at a four day seminar about it, and I fully believe in her treatment program. If I had cancer, I would follow her program rather than any of their cancer treatments. I hope this post helps people. Thank you for the song, Tom! And for bringing thought and awareness to this issue!
❤
This song helped me a lot last year when I was going though my stage 4 cancer thank u Tom Macdonald 💯
i love you Tom
As a survivor of cancer at the age of 1, I'm 24 now, this song really hit close to home. Life is a fucking mess
I'm late to the game on this one but, WOW..... I'm a 2 time cancer survivor, 1st diagnosed at 20 (after baby 1), 2nd at 30 (after 2 babies),  Sucked it up and went on, because my kids and husband need me. This hit home HARD. I'm now 35. (So I'm editing this because I just got diagnosed with breast cancer. Honestly I just don't know what to think anymore. I love the song and it will hopefully help me through treatment.)
I am a new fan. 💖 Please keep on making righteous music. Holding on to the notion there might be a hero in this very sad world. Anyone who speaks the truth & says what others are afraid to say is a HERO. 🌠🤩❤️✊
Found out a week ago I might have cancer going to get more test done in two weeks. Ever since I was told that my world crashed down hard. Idk what is going to happen.
O that Is DEEP!!!!
Tom what are you, really men you scare the bit devil out of me I just hope and pray that you are as legit as your lyrics portrait you to be. We the inyangas of South Africa have cured most cancer related symptoms to any cancer they have created.
Damn dude. This is wonderful and amazing - I cant conceptualize any other words.
But I did survive cancer and my name is Loriann
I have cancer Tom Macdonald my dad said this is my song when I first heard it I was crying and everyone cried
wow thank you how wonderful -
Love what you say. I lost my mom to cancer. Thank you 😢
PEOPLE NEED TO STOP FIGHTING CANCER. THEY NEED TO START FIGHTING THE SYSTEM. THEIR POISON. For once someone understand. Show me I am not alone!  We've been paying them to kill ourselves, we're dying to keep living It's the system, it's a prison, we keep trying to beat it We get cancer from keeping all of our demons a secret
I beat breast cancer 2 years ago but now my sister has ovarian cancer and going through chemo. Damn this song hits home so hard. Biggest money maker but refuse to cure people because the money will stop flowing. Stay strong and fight hard💪🏼
😭
I love alot of Tom's music, and this one hits home, listening to it and thinking of my nephew that passed away after beating cancer and passing while in remission. This song describes him and I wish I could tell Tom MacDonald how much this song truly means to me. He is tge realist artist out.
I am a cancer survivor. I had stage 3 throat cancer from tobacco use 20 yrs ago. The words in this song is so true
I remember my teacher telling me that someone we will know in the future will be effected by cancer! The whole class said "how" cancer was not nearly as common! Same teacher also said that we would be paying for water in plastic bottles! Class said "who is that stupid!" Here we are in 2022 and I know 3 close people who have passed away from cancer and paying for water in plastic bottles! 😩
This is awesome 😎, keep putting the truth out there, man.  This video has lots of❤️!
Love you brother, that was Tremendous.
I lost my momma at 17 years old. Worst 10 years of my life was watching her suffer.
We've had many cures back  in early 1900 but they shut Those people down or paid them off, they make more money off no cures. Makes me sick
Isn't he Canadian? Doesn't Canada have free health care?
ONG IVE MISSED/NEEDED THIS AGAIN
Tom is the greatest rapper alive hands down
i lost both of my parents to cancer mom had kidney cancer dad had lung cancer i miss them so much. It is hard seeing 2 strong people slowly slip away
cancer is a real thing  i may die soon becaus i have caner
My mom has cancer this song hits hard on me 😢
Tom MacDonald has a new fan for life..
I love everything about this song, the video is great... But I gotta ask, why does that doctor have painted on eyebrows?
Lost my hubby to the big c love this song tom thank you
I lost my father to brain cancer long ago.  This song talks to my soul.  Thank you.
my dads going thru chemo and this song has gotten me through so many nights… thank you tom. my dads a fighter 😢❤️
I know this song has been out for quite awhile but I just heard it. Somebody very close to me has cancer so I wanted to say thank you. This song is beautiful and made me cry 🥲🥲🥲 THANK YOU!!!
👍🖖
Inspired  Thank you
I lost my mom to breast cancer 10 years ago. She was 58... this song hits hard as I was convinced, during the "treatment," they were killing her. There is nothing and NOBODY who will ever convince me that big pharma OR western medicine is doing anything for health. They do it for money. Anyone who doesn't believe THAT after the last two years should really wake up. (This message is not sponsored by pfizer, by the way)
I'm on my way to the doctor and this song is giving me chills up my neck
This song hit's me deep, I've been told I wont hit the next decade... All I do is keep my mind off it but there are some really low lows :'(
I found out last august I'm terminally ill, they told me I wouldn't last a week, then they said I wouldn't last an hour. Here I am catch me if you can.
Thank You Tom for this... you have no idea what it means!
I see zero dislikes on this video. Made me fking cry
My bio dad had throat cancer and it went into remission. 6 months later he was diagnosed with brain cancer. I was his oldest child and was very grateful to have been able to introduce him to his first grandson who was 1 at the time. He was never involved in my life and yet I miss him. R.I.P dad. Your daughter could use an angel right about now.
My name is Travis O'Neil leader of the anon wolf pack we all salute you
And I'll never stop I don't care if I ever make a f****** dollar at it or not
When I saw this I became a dedicated soldier in my own army of promoting you
My Father Robert Michael O'Neill is going through cancer treatment as we speak
And this right here is when you spoke to my soul
I'm 50years old  Might have cancer again,  beat bone cancer at 7 yrs  Hope to beat it again when they find it this time.  Have to look after my 27yr old son for as long as I can.  We only have each other right now! Don't know who will do it when I'm gone! He's my strength!  Just hope I can be here for him! I've raised him for 27 years,  hope to do it another 27 and more!
Your nick name in Scotland is "the Bruce"ya legends and yer Mr's
Thanks for song.
SO BE NICE TO OTHERS.YOU DONT KNOW THEYRE STORY...true story insurance doesn't pay for treatment...
I lost both my nanna and granddad to stage 4 lung cancer and even the my granddad kept his vows because he stood by and supported my nanna thou her final journey and said good bye first sadly six months later he passed away from the similar cancer. Thank you Tom
put this man on a stage in front of the entire world please
dad passed from cancer 04.... stay strong all the warriors
I can't tell you how much I appreciate these lyrics.  I've heard the estimate that 80% of the population foster cancerous cells at one time or another.  Most cancers go undiagnosed and are naturally suppressed by the immune system.  It's only when treatments like chemo-therapy and/or radiation therapy(ies) destroy the natural immune system that people are more likely to succumb to tumors and cancerous cell growth.  Our "medical system" is the third leading cause of death - NOT COUNTING those who die due to cancer therapies.  Put those numbers in the mix, and the medical/pharmaceutical industries kill more than wars, famine, and gun violence combined . . . and yet, they want ALL of us to be able to see "doctors" via socialized medicine (on our tax dollar).  Something to SERIOUSLY think about.
Your music is real thank God that people like you speak the truth we need more people like you to stand up
There is a cure.
My dad had stage 3 brain cancer in 2012 and it was entering stage 4. My dad almost gave up but he told me that I was all who was on his mind. He is now 15 years cancer free. God bless everyone who is/was or who has a family member who has been through cancer. I'll be praying for all of you.
I'm 2 time survivor... breast cancer ... thank you Doc  Nurses  technicians .. yea  all that money ??? Still no cure!!!
Beautiful
‘We’ve been paying them to kill ourselves’ love it 😍 thanks Tom for such a lovely song full of great messages. I can relate to this song after losing two loved ones to the big C recently 👌
Tom you did awesomely awesome with this one  You definitely got it !
I'm bawling my eyes out
Absolutely Beautiful
This song deserves way way more views. It needs to be spread
ive lost so many people the last 10 years, my mama died at 58, my mother in law and father in law. my step father. several of my friends. both my dads parents. (grandpa was a father to me. he went at 64..he left when i was 12, im 54 now. not a single damn day goes by i dont thnk about him) im tired and terrified.
I can't, I just can't right now. 😭💔 The absolute love of my life is fighting right now. Tom, you have just said everything that's in my heart right now. Thank you for putting together the words my heart couldn't express. Keep doing you.
Beautiful song sweetie!!!
My sister just went to be with the Lord last month due to cancer. Death is a win/win situation. Eighter she stays here with her family or goes home to be with God
Thank you for the truth you speak-Things we all know but never want to say, hear or have the energy to do anything about!
God bless , see so 2
I fucking Love all of your music, Tom. I'm a paramedic and also have Cystic Fibrosis. I've had a double lung transplant and now take a new medicine supposed to make things better. Luckily I have insurance but without it..........it's $30,000 Per MONTH. America's health care system is garbage and I see it from the perspective of a health care worker and a patient.
My grandfather was touched by cancer, you are a beautiful human Tom McDonald we love you we are here to support you
Where are we going through political circumstances to limit what we can do democrats and Republicans have the ultimate tool to find a solution politically you should not have any way to stop progress
Thanks tom just had Cancer cut out today love you man keep the Faith peace out
I thought that very same thing! BECAUSE there’s no money in the cure….only the symptoms….it’s sick is what it is!
Preach, Tom.   Don't stop.  Powerful
This made me burst in tears. His music is quite literally a masterpiece of saints. He raps about the truth in politics, and even made a song exposing what it's like being an artist. But now, he made a song about Cancer? This is truly amazing, he spotlights problems to teach us the truth about them, not to make money off of them like everybody else. What a great man!
Good song....
So they are doing it all for money? Cuz at the end of the day money ain't shit.
Im two years remission in March. Its hard even now, with the damage from the treatment itself. Low right lung function, constant pain in my chest.  But you know what? I adapted. I've got the best job I've ever had, a son now, and a fiance who took care of me when I couldn't even shower myself.  KEEP FIGHTING FRIENDS
Amen Brother....there are cures...insanity...pharmacea! Word!
Legend. Except we Christians know we never die.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Holy shit Tom thank you your something special man I got chills thank you
Love you Tom my mom was a victim 😓😓😓😓
They have cures for many things but the money they make from us being sick and feeding us pain killers ,dam.
Tom. You make me cry man. Your absolute love of the truth and telling it in music is amazing. Please be safe and know there are hundreds of thousands of good people who believe in your mission.  And adore you, Nova and your dogs. Don't stop. We need you. Now more than ever. Thank you.
Ty for speaking for me being sick sucks ty Tom
Diet is the biggest problem. The food that the masses eat is mostly crap.
I'm 24. I currently have terminal brain cancer..I came upon this song and you don't know how much this song is helping me get thru this.
My mother has been on her death bed this means more to me then you think Tom thank you keep up the great work man
Far more money in treating a disease than curing a disease! Sad
Find out January 25th, isnt my first rodeo, got this 🤘🏻
This one hit super hard ❤
Every time i listen to this song i cry, my brother fought for 18 years my grandmother fought 14 years both lost the fight.  ❤✌
This song hits home.
I’m stage IV Kidney Cancer.  2 years in.  The treatment side effects have mad me a lot sicker than the cancer.  This is a great song.
Currently fighting cancer right now and needed this song in my life.
I Love this song! I have oral Cancer.
I'm not crying, YOU'RE CRYING!
this hit hard, honestly amazing! health is the most important no money can solve but unfort i need an operation that does cost money and nothing else will work i cant afford it so unfort some of us are just stuck
This song has really helped me last year and this year. I was diagnosed with cancer in November 2021 and had to have my index ringer and the long hand bone that goes with it removed. Now here it is January 2022 and I'm fixing to start my chemo. This song keeps me fighting each day.
❤️
Wow crying rn...
My Auntie (a good family friend) passed away of Cancer, late last night… this song is the one song stopping me from losing my shit right now. Thank you Tom.
This Is one of the most powerful, well written songs I have ever heard in my life, and I’ve said that a lot about Mr. McDonald and Miss Novak and Company. Wow, so powerful. We’ve got your back guys we have your back. NEVER STOP!!! Because… THEY CANNOT stop the TRUTH :-)
As a survivor who refused chemo, this is definitely the song that keeps me strong and fighting. Thank you Tom and Nova, all the best to you both xo
I lost my mom to cancer I feel this song for real
When you die you go to the spirit world then heaven (if you decide to repent) That’s a condensed version of it
This is exactly how I was told I had cancer. I went in for a sinus infection and my parents were standing by me and the Dr came in and told us I had Leukemia and we told him he was in the wrong room. I then was was bed bound for 11 mouths in the hospital doing intense chemotherapy. I am not 9 YEARS CANCER FREE!!! 🎗🧡
Wow 1st ever time I’ve listened to it and it touched my heart and made me cry I’ve lost my auntie and grandad to cancer and that’s what started my mental health of and I was suicidal at a young age and your songs give people like me strength to keep on moving and appreciate what we have thank you Tom👍👊
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲💪💪💪💪💪💪🙏🙏🙏
My grandad who was 83 died from lung cancer on December 6th 2021. He deteriorated very quickly. He died 2 weeks after his diagnosis. He died peacefully. I held his hand as he took his last breath.
This song is so very touching brought me too tears! I’m a fighter and survivor!
I really needed this I lost my dad to cancer I haven't been the same since
Over a year later this song still gets me and I cry I've lost most of my family to cancer most recently my dad in 2017 thank you tom for doing this music game your way and I wish you and nova nothing but the best life has to offer
Dr. Burzynski has a cure that the government want anyone to have. They're attacked him and tried to steal his patents for decades, but he just keeps curing people....when your governments and big pharma let's your fellow man die for profits...and the media backs them up... How can we trust them with anything? Covid is a bigger money money maker...so there is zero chance that what they're doing is for the greater good. I question everything.. Tom's got it right. Start thinking for yourself otherwise they will do it for you. IF YOU STAND FOR NOTHING, YOU FALL FOR EVERYTHING.
This song is so sad..but so true. My mom had cancer but she fought. Five years cancer free. Thank you God
I love the energy and power you bring to tracks like best rapper and me response...the present you as a great rapper.......this however is a whole nother level. This shows you as a pretty a good singer as well. It would be great to hear you do more like this. 👍👍👍
Pfzeir just took the jab millions profits AND bought the rest of the cancer drug market that they didnt ALREADY OWN.
Great song
My son has lukemia and it hurts as a mother to not be able to help him. He took a new medication and that is what caused it.
There is more money in treating disease then in curing disease.
What’s really getting me is that more people haven’t had a chance to hear these words this way.
I already had mad respect for you Tom,  this song showcases your depth.  You are Legendary!   Keep preaching Brother We are listening. Steven Anderson HOG
Yes that is true
My nana died from cancer and this song makes me cry... She had melanoma (skin cancer) then it went into her brain... :(
BTW a cunt in Scotland is not a bad thing xxx
Love u Tom xxxxxx
My mom is terminal. I'm sending her this song.
The doctor scares me more then anything
This is a great song!
Awesome video. Cried all the way through it...
That's what I'm talking about! Great awareness!
I always have tears listening to this song, my son died of cancer at 25. This song actually plays at my local BigLots...they are so based
I lost two cousins to cancer... one I called mom and one I called my aunt. I didn't live the best life and damn sure didn't deserve to lose them the way I did. They didn't deserve to go in their 40's. That's just too fucking young. R.I.P to both of them.
42 years cancer free Feb 8th
Would him and imagine dragons be good
Exercise. Diet. Sleep well.  Reduce stress.  Reduce alcohol.   Eat whole foods Reduce sugar  Lifestyle hacks to prevent cancer Believe in Jesus he will take you to heaven.
You won't know how to be brave Till you choose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength Till you've struggled to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith Till you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take Till you realize you didn't break  Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart!  Wow no words except Tom Macdonald's a lyrical angel on earth, truth!
As someone who has lost their father and both grandparents to cancer and had my own battle to I just want to say thank you for this. Its by far the best song I have ever heard and its message is insane but yeah thank you from the bottom of my heart dude xx
Look. in high-school my grandmother got diagnosed with bone cancer. She was nothing short of a great American. I grew up near them and spent a lot of time at their house over the years. She ended up in a care place in town. Me being in my senior year had some free time and, I visited her every day.... I had a free period and visited each week day. Looking back now I would never in my life give up a moment of that time i spent hanging out.  Whether it was reading, listening, or just talking, I just wish my family could have Rose-Mary back.
As I listen to this song I think about how hard my wife fought her battle that she lost but she also won her wings rip jen❤
LOVE AND RESPECT...TOM AND NOVA....THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR JOURNEY WITH ME N THE WORLD....YOU GUYS ARE REAL💯🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
✌🏼❤️🤗 PEACE LOVE HAPPINESS 🇺🇸🦅🌎✝️🇳🇮🌹🦋....THANK YOU T. McDONALD....LOVE AND RESPECT 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋
My dad went through this recently, all good now. Tom I have recently found you and I hope you make it to the top, thank you for the love and truth you spread! Thank you for truly doing you!
this made me cry
Just found out my dad has cancer, his second bout, I know he will kick its ass like he did the first time.
Cancer is prevented not cured
Damn Bro! It's ashamed that you have enemies. Shake em! They can't touch your energy!
True legend u are tom keep doin u fer as long as u can cuz their will never be another u ..so many of ur songs jus touch home keep up the amazing work, thanks Tom💯💪
You're right on with this
My mother was told this news last year in November…she was 75 and in a lot of pain…went with her for treatments…she lasted a day in a half in hospice…December 14th she entered god’s kingdom…
I love this song but it's hard to listen to. Much love Tom
Cancer I would like to invoke my freedom of speech just in case I'm piss someone off for what I'm fixing to say cancer I had cancer I had female cancer they did a complete total history to me in my early twenties later in life they thought I had breast cancer and I was so worried and scared during that time of my life it wouldn't even funny I was waiting on the biopsy to come back I was so pissed off during that time life is so f***** up I was so thankful when I got the news that it was negative but I will use the word cancer as a metaphor for so many things in life see I believe cancer is anything that consumes you that takes control of your life from a drug addiction to alcohol addiction to sex addiction prostitution gang affiliation suicidal thoughts anxiety depression Postmates stress disorder self-harming yourself like imoism people bottles all kinds of cancers there's more cancer in life than just female cancer breast cancer prostate cancer throat cancer lung cancer brain cancer mouth cancer cancer is anything that consumes your life but when you have female cancer breast cancer are prostate cancer lung cancer the cancer cell has to be in your DNA it lays dormant and then something awakens the cell that's within the DNA if you are not born with a cancer cell you'll never get cancer that even goes for smokers and non-smokers that goes for secondhand smoke someone that never smoked a day in their life has to have the cancer cell within the DNA genes it lays dormant and then something just wakes it up if you do not have the cell within the DNA you will never get cancer some people has the cell and some does not the answer is in the DNA once they can figure out how to separate the cancer cell from the DNA Gene then you'll have less cancer but no one wants to be a guinea pig for that but there's more cancer in life than just cancer question is what type of cancer is everyone buying anything that takes over your life and it makes you sick mentally physically are consumes you it's a cancer to me question is is it dealt with by doctors medication coping skills or self-control what kind of cancer is everyone facing I wonder 🤔 and when we all die we all go in a deep sleep until the rapture takes place if you believe in Jesus Christ is your lord and savior our God the Father the son and the holy Ghost then the dead in Christ shall rise first then every knee will bow every time we confess their sins and God will either let you in heaven our sin your ass to hell but when you die you just go on a deep sleep and a deep slumber the rapture has not took in place yet it would be out of order the only one that's in heaven is God himself his one and only begotten son Jesus Christ that died for all humanity and the angels the only one that's in hell is Lucifer the devil and all the fallen Angels that are demons no one at this time is in heaven nor in hell for the rapture has not took in place just pick up your Bible sick wisdom and start reading the word and God will give you the wisdom and knowledge and understanding like he gave his one and only begotten son and Matthew chapter 6 verse 9-13 is The Lord's prayer that's the only prayer we're supposed to teach anybody if you're a new beginner read Matthew Mark Luke and John the first four Gospels and the New testament and just seek wisdom knowledge and understanding of his word love the song though it's got me thinking 🤔
Someone with pancreas cancer. It speaks to me. I just hate to leave 2 kids behind. But I'm being as strong as I can.
My husband was diagnosed with Stage 4 Colon-Rectal Cancer on Dec 14th because it's metastasized into his Liver.  He begins Radiation & Chemo on Dec 27th. I'm petrified of what's about to happen, but I'm gonna fight right beside my husband every step of the way!!! #TeamJeff
Tom, I wanted to go into music, but you're Rapping everything I wanna say to the world 😢
I don't say this much because the guilt I feel for those who haven't done what I have, but I beat Cancer 2 times!! Fuck Cancer!!
Disappointed that this only has 3.2m views in a year.
Tom your heart Is pure❤ Don't EVER change❤❤❤
I've lost 4 ppl and my dog Grace to cancer  since September 2021.   My kids dad, his cousin, his mom, my sister, and my Grace .  I've stayed clean though it all. 4 years 5 months clean...   Not ever going back to that life. My kids and grandkids need me.  Hell I  need me.  ✌️💜🙏🧘📿🎵
You don't know what you can take, til you realize you didn't break.. 🔥❤️🔥
I really love most of his music. This song though, for those fighting, is amazing. Touches on the main points. BILLIONS spent, weed kills some cancer, how could they not find something safer than chemo therapy. Sour sop is kinda where they got the idea for chemo. The industry that keeps us sick, or not caring if we get better, is WAY to powerful. Keeping us under the tyranny of healthcare, that never makes us healthy. Sick sad world we live in these days
If this doesn't make you tear up... I don't know what will =( i respect him so much for this song. So much heart and soul
as someone whose sister has been in and out of hospital since she was 14 , now 30, the chorus hits home fucking well done tom  not an easy subject but this reminds me of my little sister and how hard it is waiting to know the outcome each time she goes to hospital.....thank you so very much!
who doesn't know  where theyre going when they die? either leavin or gettin left wit Jesus or with the Neph who are the demons you mighta met while u fiendin and when u slept they aint leavin they gettin left they aint the aliens, its ourselves
Far out man! This hit me hard!! Lost my mum 19yrs ago today to cancer. 😢
#nightbirde
my grandad was diagnosed with bowl cancer in February-march this year sadly and unfortunately he didn't make it now this Christmas is going to be weird as hell cause he always used to come over for Christmas this will be the first year he won't be I remember cleaning out his house around the time of my birthday he died late march early April I think May we scattered his ashes because it was a pain to get the documents sorted and pay for it
Man this song  reminds  me about my exboyfrined  Josh  his self  not well earth. I miss him so much hes has all paksin  psd and sole  when he has no control
Wow tom your song is amazing
This song gives me chills keep it up HOG
Tom, thank you. I'll be saying goodbye to my kids someday sooner than later. I fight the inevitable everyday. This song helps all of us in so many ways. My boys will be better because of this.
You are so right abot real life hell ya dont give  up you are stronger  .
Thats  the government  fro you they do have cre fro  dont care how we all end up thats the government  your so right  about .wow you are so amazing
No comment brov just super us well nova 👌👌👌🤌
Sadly Tom, early this morning my lil Granddaughter lost her battle with cancer & passed away. I have a real angel topper on my Christmas tree. Thank you #HOG for all the love. 💞
FACTS! Am balling at this. Thank you!

I also believe they have had the cure for cancer and diabetes ect.. they would rather treat them cure.. Being paralyzed I meant alot alot of them evil heartless Drs
My mama is battling terminal cancer...this song hits home. Stay amazing thank you for music we can relate to
Stage IV inflammatory breast cancer here....thank you for this song ♥️
Yes my mom fought breast cancer 9 years. Had the both removed. It was so sad what she went through. And absolutely could have been do way better than it was. They put her through test just like the monkeys and pig they test on. It was horrible scary and sad to watch.😰😥😪
Watch on Netflix I think its called HEAL
Powerful
Truth hurts - Tom, you nailed it. Thank you 💋❤....We will keep fighting
This song is underrated...its should be in billions views
If anyone questions Tom's authenticity, remember, he was about to beat Nightbirde on the number one song.  He found out that she had cancer and started to tell his fans to download HER song instead of his.  ❤❤❤❤❤
I shared this with my brother who's daughter fought and beat leukemia. He cried and loved the song. Thank you so much Tom for this piece of art you made.
There is already a cure for cancer they are trying to cover up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVrd1hWVpls&t=1s
They sell us cigarettes and liquor, built a business on our addictions🤯
Tom you are an Angel without wings.🕊 keep going
People that think this dude is a politicly raciest asshole...have not watch this video
The word are brilliant he is right, why would they want a cure, when they make millions from the sick. I'm in Britain and we don't have health insurance, well some do but not the majority of us ordinary folk, having health insurance might get you to see a specialist quicker than through the JP and NHS but in a lot of cases if the specialist you see find you have cancer that requiree an operation 9 times out of 10 that operation will be done in a NHS hospital by your specialist who also works for the NHS, of course those with a bottomless pit of money will I'm guessing its different for them. I don't know how the every day folk in America manage when they get ill. Stunning and very moving song Tom.
I am nearing my second year of controls after a very tough cancer treatment and it looks promising. Keep coming back to this song when the times are tough. Thanks for this.
I have stage 3 tongue cancer
Wow. Just WOW.
wow you just cured cancer!
After watching this I must say amen and amazing job. You say it beautifully.  But I won't watch this again for a long while. My mom didn't win her 3rd round . I remember her laying on my couch in tears cause she hurt so bad. The woman I ran to to kiss my boo boos had one I couldn't fix and it killed me. God it broke something in me when she said she didn't want to die a few weeks before she let go. What the hell do you say that? I told her keep fighting but I knew she was tired. Then when her moment of her final peace came she took her last breathe  and I'll never get that damn sound out of my head. Like a demon it'll chase me to the grave. The bandages were ripped off with this and I want to vomit not cause I hate your message but because it hurts  cause I hurt. God I would have traded places with her. In a heartbeat . Then maybe my family wouldn't have fell apart. And I wouldn't had to watch it or feel it .
Love this guy and his TRUTH!!!
I miss you Granny. You were a Saint. I wish I could have seen you in your las tdays. But someone had to take care of Dad. He ended up meeting you in heaven when he passed from heartbreak, though...  Guess angels can't stay on earth forever.
I once had a different perspective on death, and I really wanted to stick around this place for a long time. One moment you think of death as no big deal, then you lose a relative, and think of how they are feeling at that exact moment. It really is scary to think about how your own relatives would feel and where you will go when you die. Of course, you might know, but not in a sincere way. I thought I was the only one who had this perspective, but then I realised with this song that I'm not alone. Of course, it's WAY too early for me to think of death, but, the thing to consider is the fact that, just because you're here today, doesn't mean you'll be here tomorrow. I think some of your songs could have saved, hundreds, thousands, if not TENS of thousands of lives. Maybe even HUNDREDS of thousands. The energy some of your songs bring is nothing like any I've seen before. Even made me feel strong during dark times.
Tom is reminding people to not give up with anything that happens to you. Tom is MOVING
This deserves 3xs the views. Makes me tear up every listen. Such a powerful message! Thank you Tom for making it. And thank you Nova for doing a killer editing job as always!
Yes! Lost my first dear husband.
I have a cure with ultrasonic pulse waves , hit me up
My sister-in-law earned her wings tonight. Her long fight with cancer is over. Heaven gained and angel, but we lost one. Keep my family in your prayers. She listened to this song daily. I bought her your cd and she loved it. Bless you and Nova, Tom. You kept her spirits up.
Yes, money does not solve problems.
Tom is Great and Has a Heart!  Love you bro!
It make me so happy to know that there are people like you out there. Thank you Tom.
He has it all , he is Great
I've died bro.  We live on eternally.  We can come back to Earth if we choose to.  My Mom died of cancer and came back as my granddaughter.  Earth is a school.
there is a cure for cancer but that would make big bussiness loose money. follow the money. my grandpa has stage 4 cancer and had alot of money. he spent millions to get treatment from a place out of country and it was helping him. he was healing. it made the cancer turn on itself. he needed a dose every month. but he was cut off because the government said no. those mf killed my grandpa and he would still be alive if it werent for them..
Just lost my dad Thanksgiving eve 😢😞😪... brain cancer... I played this many times for him before he left me but he still lost his battle
Ty my Dad had cancer I have not seen him in a while but I hope I can see him soon 😭✅🥺😊
My wife died in 2018 from this disease.. Beautiful song and a hug from a distance to all the people who fight every day against this disease!!
I was diagnosed with stage 2BE Non hodgkins lymphoma at 21 while pregnant with my first pregnancy. It was close to my brain, in my sinus, eye socket and cheek. To anyone fighting cancer... you've got this... there is hope even when you think there is none, cling to that Ray of light when you're sat in the darkness questioning your whole life. Why me?, I don't want to die, will I make it, will I see another Christmas?... we all think these things. Please never give up. Fight. Kick ass. I love you.
Love this. They have cures for a deadly global virus in around the world. 50 years, if not sooner, but 50+ years they still don't have a cure for cancer. FUCK THAT !!!. Thanks brotherman for this song
Hey Tom I know you really don't think they're ever going to cure cancer do you it's a billion-dollar operation they don't want to lose that money but they have people donating all the time to find the queue up which they'll never release they probably already have the Cure that's why they have pills to be able to slow stuff down and that's so sad
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is one of the very many reasons why I love Tom MacDonald.
My friend has a 6yo son who is currently fighting his 2nd round of leukemia. She had to sell her dance studio to be able to afford just a portion of his medical bills. A coworker of mine just yesterday found out his mom can be released from the hospital (end stage breast cancer) but health ins won’t pay for the 24/7 in home care, cheapest they found is 38$/hr, but the ins will pay for her to go into a state run nursing home that’s about 3hr away. While his family (his dad passed away last year, his sister also has breast cancer and him & his wife have a 6mo new baby) tries to figure out what they’re going to do he got a call today from his mothers oncologist…they’ve exhausted all treatment options & as soon as they stop anything the tumors grow/spread, she’s being released on hospice, compassionate care is all they can do… bc of $! Our health care system shouldn’t be for profit. Like Tim says, with all the $ given towards cancer research they haven’t found anything??!!??!! Curing makes no $ but treatments do, why find a cure and lose all that potential money? Disgusting! My heart breaks for them all. Hold your loved ones, say I love you every time, be a good person…life is way too precious & short for all of the bs causing division!
i lost my Mom and Dad to cancer. No cares to cure when there is so much money to be made in 'treatment'.
Great truth Tom
Thank you tom.  Lost the love of my life of 15 years last year to cancer. Has bern very tough lately. God bless you and your messages.
The world is being used as Guinea pigs by the ignorance fed to the ignorant!
If you believe in God he will guide you through everything cancer mental illness everything God bless everybody.
You saved my son from killing him self. Thank you so much.
Jesus love you
Whenever this rolls through my playlist I either have to change it, or bawl over my own fighters I have lived with, loved, and some I have even lost.  Man Tom, you nailed the human experience with this one, more than any I have heard from you yet.  Well done.
My mom quit smoking two years later had cancer... she beat it then developed cickle cell and went to her brain died two weeks after and three days before my first daughter was born.....my heart goes to anyone who lost a love one to such a horrible disease. ...
You music touches people's hearts 💕
What a nice thing to do.
Big Pharma is everyone's enemy
No matter how many times I hear this song it hits just as hard as the first time. I have lost quite a few people to cancer and it still gets me every time... After all this time... It's still a better profit to these companies to treat the disease then to cure it. Call me a conspiracy theorist if you want but if after all the time and money spent on this we still don't have a cure, either it's incurable or they don't want to cure it. We all die eventually, if losing people has taught me anything it's this... It's not the time we are here for that matters, it's what we do with that time. We spend far too much time fearing death and not enough time truly living. Make each day count and live as if you were going to die tomorrow.
But what if it cancer my twin sister was totaled in a dwi wreck bit the song has same message
All diseases are curable. Big Pharma doesn’t cure anything, and you won’t find answers there. Chemo and radiation are toxic and will kill you. Walk away from Allopathic medicine, it’s Witchcraft and Sorcery according to the Bible. There are natural cures for everything, why limit your options if you are being told you have a Terminal disease? Read the books they want to burn, watch the videos they want to censor, and listen to the voices that they want to silence. Our water, food, and air are being poisoned, and yet, people are still lining up for Big Pharma’s jabs as a solution. Pure foolishness....  There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. Proverbs 14:12  I had an “incurable disease” about 10 years ago. My doctors offered me no hope, just endless medications with awe full side effects. Out of desperation, I cried out to God and begged Him for a solution, and I felt Him telling me to walk away from Big Pharma, and look for answers elsewhere. He would guide me if I put the work in, and so that’s what I did.   I started researching and looking for alternatives, and eventually found someone who told me how to cure my “incurable disease”, and it worked!  If people loved Truth more, they would be able to see through the deceptions. There are many Natural cures for cancer, Some have even been mentioned in this comment section. Open your ears, and your eyes...or you will stay in darkness.   Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Matthew 7:13
I lost my mother too pancreatic cancer back in 2007 I miss her so much me and my big brother both does we keep crying on her birthday and Thanksgiving and Christmas day and our birthdays we want her to be hear but we know we will see her in Heaven God bless we miss her so much I can't stop crying because I miss my mother big time okay
Wow! Absolutely amazing and breathtaking video!
Never touching a cig again
PRAYERS for everyone and their family who is battling this horrible  disease.
Tom you are the man! Do not ever forget that.
Thanks Tom. This song means a lot to me because I’m recovering from stage three colon cancer. Thank you Tom.
This hit me right in the feels
This is just thing I do like a Sheperd to his sheep 🐑 they know my voice
Praise God
I really love this track , this one really touched my heart
Tom posted this video the week we found out my dad has cancer and now more then a year later hes still fighting.  I guess I was wrong dads gonna go soon, maybe somehow ill come back in a bit and say it was a scare and that a miracle happened.  Never mind.
This hit home hard! I never had to go through chemo, but I had to go through having cancerous melanoma on my forehead that was removed under general anesthesia.  Thank you for this song! 💗
Thank you Tom. I have been fighting brain cancer for the last two years. I have had surgery radiotherapy and chemotherapy and am currently stable. I just discovered you today and this song was incredible and has given me so much strength to push on. I am sure this will be my go to, in those moments of weakness and fear. Thank you!
FUCK CANCER
I actually couldn't finish listening to this, since I lost my mother and my cousin to this awful disease... that I know they're creating for us. And yeah... they DO have the cure.
You're voicing my thoughts, while showing your face. Respect. Keep going
this song sad asf nigga
Fuck man...you made me cry...asshole
WHY are there ANY "dislikes" of this video?????? I DON'T understand!!!! Are we really living in a world that is THAT insane???? Tom...brother...you have my respect and my prayers!!! THANK YOU for listening to your calling!!!
Just stumbled over another great gem from Tom. He is sucking in a lot of the peoples pain and transforms it into a song. Tom and Nova are just giants in nowadays art! Greets from germany
Every time I hear this song i start crying.  I lost my aunt back in 2017 due to cancer. She died the day before my parents got married? This is my favorite song, Love you Tom, keep up the good work ❤
My wife's mom dies of cancer not long after this songs release. My grandma has leukemia right now. This song hits home hard.
Been a minute since I had a good cry... yikes. this one, like the rest, hit so different...
Cbd oil is a good start 👌
Royal Raymond rife had a cure for all cancers almost a hundred years ago till the people above him cut his funding because he wouldn't sell out! Ponder on that!
My moms mom had cancer and died
LOVE YOU TOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Without your health you have nothing.  What I told my supervisor when he asked why I won't just get jabbed to keep my job.
RIP Kerry  to the strongest fighter  I've known. Plz keep up on your mammogram
I am literally in tears! This song /video touched me so much. Because i had cancer and still dealing with all the issues, its most definitely rough. This song is most definitely going to help these that are battling with it! And yes "we are strong and we are a fighter" Thank you so much Tom! I have heard so much about your music, good and bad things, i just didn't have had time to check out your full music out. This music video was shared on my facebook group and i am now a fan of your music. I love music that speaks to me. I am a music reviewer and i got my own business called The Tootie Show. Better keep an eye out for my special reviews!
This song seriously hit home. As someone who battled cancer as a child and has had to deal with the effects of the treatments since then. As well as watching my wife’s best friend’s mom fight and lose her battle with cancer after 16 months. This song is right
Dude...just...dude... I'm not crying, you're crying!
Omg  This is my LIFE every day, for the last 4 years... via my best friend.  We moved, 4 hours from everyone we knew,  then she was diagnosed. We are all alone.   This song gave me Instant cathartic tears.... and I'm sharing this with my partner,  the WARRIOR trying to navigate fighting cancer through big pharma only... 😭😭😭  It's...  surreal? There really aren't words. I do wish I could clone myself...lol. And I hope I don't loose her... and I pray we don't loose all we've worked 16 years for...  Thank you, this feels like acknowledgement.  ❤
God Bless you Tom. I sent this to my 73 year old Mom who's battling cancer and it made her cry. Matter of fact, here's her response: I loved that song 🎵  It made me cry 😢  Yes, I Am a Fighter 😘🥰👍❣
Loving this ❤️
🙏
i found this song and i just found out my grandpa who raised me has lung cancer and its been a pretty hard couple days
Thank you for this song.
Went through Stem Cell transplant June 27 2020 for AML, the song near brought me to tears, and the comments on this post finished the job. Looking at being on disability by the time I am 40 and most of it is due to the chemo and radiation that I went through, just to have any hope of seeing my kids grow up and being there for them.
Love this song
This song moves me into tears. My little boy was diagnosed with liver cancer back in May, he was 5 months old at the time. He's about to be a year old and is almost done with chemotherapy. I continue to pray that nobody has to go through this and I pray for those who have or are currently going through this horrible disease.
How is this video so suppressed?  It has so much heart and soul and a meaningful message. I will always wonder how anyone could dislike this video. If anyone sees this and disliked this song and vid please express your opinion. I am really interested.
After a long weekend of pain and meds from Friday's surgery, I can proudly proclaim that I am CANCER FREE!!! You tried once and I beat you cancer and I will keep on beating you! Tom, thank you for this song. It added to my joy of today's awesome news. Screw you Cancer! To my fellow warriors, please fight hard and don't ever give up!! ♥♥♥
.
That was deep
i will never stop fight no i have never sufered the pain of cancer but the pain of depression the pain of feeling worthless the pain of losing your first love and losing everything that made you who you are that takes alot of fight to overcome and i will always fight i will never back down i will always fight and i will always stand with those that speak the truth even when it hurts the truth is the truth but even if its true there can still be lyes within it but the fact is that no matter what fight for your life fight for your freedom and most importantly fight to stay alive
I watched my late wife battle cancer for 15 years and I don't know what was worse watching her get sicker and sicker and the twisted doctors using her like a guinea pig may Almighty God forgive them!
Chemo sells, cures are just that cures no more big money after.
THC eats cancer cells
You rule. Thank you so much for this and all of your work.
Ya touch my hearth bruva. My fa died from a cancer in his shoulder bones, when i was little. The docs give him six months but he lived with his atrocity n constant pain. For a year n an half in an hospital. Doped of Morphine but it wasn't enough do bare his torture. Life is a bitch!!!!!!!!!!
update I beat my appendix cancer n want to say this song dropped right as I found out everything happens for a reason thanks Tom for ur inspiration through ur music
words can not express how much this song hits from my grandparnets to other people i knew that were friends cancer takes so many from us and we've done so much research and yet still no cure its just wrong cancer is a demon just like mental health it comes in destroys life and takes people away that couldve had a huge impact on this world but yet a diease took them to soon and its wrong
Love this song it helps me and the mother of my three kids to get by living every day not knowing  when good night I love you will be the last  so thank you really thank you
This goes out to Kennith! Miss you man!
We all shouldn't be scared when we die, if we believe in God and put all of our faith in him we will see salvation. All MIGHT NOT go to heaven but all CAN we just need to believe in the process all bad things lead to things greater than we ask. And their is no death or dying unless you go to hell but when we "die" it's just a rebirth into what we know as heaven but going to hell is dying for all of eternity or end of time. Now I don't say I should go to heaven, I believe I should go to hell because of my sins, but Gods judgement is the only judgement, not the judges in court. God bless all he has created and I pray for all even the worst of the worst of people that they can look towards God and find their salvation. P.s. This song made me cry because when I was 11 my friend died of cancer at 9.
Tom, I'm at a loss of words to describe your genius, your honesty, your emotion in every song. Thank you, just thank you for every single one.
Before my father died he told me if you don't have your health you dont have shit. There is a line in this song that really hits home.
Dude is unbelievable!!!
Wow! I wish I could’ve heard this song when I was going through Chemotherapy for Testicular Cancer. As you can tell from my name (Droopy Sack) I used my IGN to spark curiosity via humor to encourage boys & men to have the courage to “check” themselves. I pray everyone (YOU) struggling that they (YOU) are stronger than they (YOU) think!!! YOU ARE A FIGHTER!!!!
Please for the love of all that is Holy, DO NOT STOP, YOU HAVE A GIFT!  Everyone needs to hear your truth whether they know it or not.
Man I gotta say I'm a newer fan just within a few months honestly. But every song you have put out just resonates like nothing I've heard before. Thank you for simply being you and not bending to what society wants. We need more truth sayers. Again. Thank you.
In memory  of my brother Wayne Edward Steiger 09/11/1964 - 06/16/2021 FUCK CANCER
#StevieStrong.  We just lost our town's precious 4 year old SJ to brain cancer.  He LOVED this song.  Yes, 4 years old and he loved Tom MacDonald.  His Daddy and Mommy still do, as do his siblings.  God Bless You Tom for making this.
Lost my wife to cancer 5 years now still feels like yesterday. FFFFUUUUUCCCCKKKK CANCER!!!!!!. Thank you tom
Outstanding song such a meaningful one too.
Rip Patric William cozad. My nephew died of from radiation therapy at 6 years old after fighting it for a year.
Spot on. 95% of cancer is environmental, only 5% is genetic. There are natural cures but there is no money in that for the medical/pharmaceutical/government industry. So sad that they continue  to use humanity as lab rats. Great song.
Nicola Tesla's theory on vibrational healing was proven correct.  In Malta the oldest underground temple in the world there is a room called the Oracle Chamber designed to vibrate sound at 111hz which scientists now know kills Cancer Cells using the power of the 11th harmonic
😞 sad but brilliant, this guy is amazing.          🇬🇧
Thanks for that song brother.
That's it, I'm hooked on Tom MacDonald...at 58 no less, lol.
I found out today that my aunt has lung cancer...I fucking hate this shit
He can seriously talk about any subject and do it amazingly!
My Brother just died from lung cancer 2days ago..FUCK CANCER... thanks for your words TOM
Took most of my family.  This song brought back fond memories of my family who have come before me. Thank you.
Holy smokes this is awesome
My father just passed away last night from lung cancer 😭 miss him but I know he is no longer suffering anymore
Yes that pink ribbon is such a lie. The body can heal itself not by putting toxic chemicals in.  And yes heaven is real and those who trust in Christ for their salvation will be in paradise.
Exactly…they could find/have cure. But they making too much money. Dude, you’re a prophet.
All I have to say is wow.  I haven’t heard this song until now but I’ve been listening to all your music lately and discovered this song. I had childhood leukemia and going through the things I had to and realizing everybody next to you was fighting the same battle and sometimes even worse is more or less something that follows you throughout your entire life, the radiation, the medical bills my mom and dad had to take on because their insurance wouldn’t cover it, I’m in complete awe that a song like this even exists. I was 7 when I was diagnosed and I’m 26 now. I can’t even begin to tell you just how accurate each lyric is. I liked you as an artist before, but for somebody to come up and sing a song about this and really truly hit the most important and scary and sad parts of it…. You deserve the best man.
RESPECT!
"Dr. Burzynski has a Cancer Cure Proven". Copy and paste it in youtube. Be ready to get pissed.
This song it’s home lost my grandma to stage 3 cancer I love this sing
Contact Dr Ben Uda on YouTube for Herbal medicine to cure any type of cancer.
Reminds me of my cousin 😢
58 year old this song brought  tears to my eyes Tom is amazing
On your last video I commented that " if you ever write a fighting song i.e. "AC/DC's thunderstruck" which may considered a "fighting song" that has your patriotic finesse that would be awesome."  then I find this.....I was wrong this is the ultimate fight song and very inspirational. when I think you and nova have outdone yourselves you go further.  mind blown.. the simplistic video focused on the family.  I think if anyone else did this video or the song they would have somehow made it about themselves.  once again you and nova are proving you deserve to be such great successes as your both seem to try and inspire others through your works.
They have had a cure for cancer for over 100 years. Just let that sink in. Raymond Rife.
F.. I hate the genre , yet this guy gets me whatwver hé makes. And hé keeps hitting harder and harder. Not an untrue word in his lyrecs ever.
How can anyone dislike this, seriously.
Thank you Tom! You said what I've said for a while now... our air, food, water & products that we use for all purposes are synthetic & cause Cancer! It's obvious. We need simpler living if we want to live long & healthy lives.
Don’t Doubt, Thomas. You’re His Disciple whether you know it or not. He LIVES!
Well done Tom awesome song
Big pharma is the root of all evil. It's all about money. Fuck cancer and fuck covid. Also I notice every video has thousands of dislikes, that's the click farms.
Thank you for this most powerful song Tom.🙏🏼  Crying like a baby right now.🥺😢 I recently lost my soulmate and  beloved wife to cancer in June this year 🥺😪😢 She was diagnosed in 2019,  and fought  every single day.🙏🏼 She never let anyone know how bad the pain was, she was so strong.👸 She didn't want any sympathy from anyone. We were married for nearly 30 yrs, and she had her 48th bday in heaven just a few days ago.🙏🏼😇 The sadness, loneliness,  and helplessness are absolutely indescribable. I just deal with life now day by day, some good, some bad. Thank you again for this deep and emotional song. I enjoy your music and all your messages. God bless you  Tom 🙏  RIP Justine 1973-2021 😢💔 😭
LEGEND!!! My mom had throat cancer. Her 'Fire' and heart .was what pulled her through to survival. It's taken a lot of her. God bless you, Tom McDonald.
I’m a 28 year old ‘rebel’ and y’all got me in tears over here. I love it. The verse;    ‘You won't know how to be brave To choose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength Till you've struggled to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith Till you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take Till you realize you didn't break’   I can’t think of words to applaud this song, so I just have to leave a comment to show my appreciation,respect, and support. Love y’all man God bless 🙏
Baldness eliminates cancer?
This broke me again watching this, as my daughter with a nasty bad brain tumour  had operation and all the treatments. We have been fighting this and  doing our  best with natural treatment and the help of Jesus Christ as our guide. Fighting and believing constantly is a journey you never give up, night and day, never sleeping till a new piece of information to heal the body, more knowledge, more, more, more, it becomes addictive because you can never let go. Then the news comes the tumour is shrinking its like believing and unbelieving in one, it’s hard to wake up, yet you know it’s really true. But the Doctor always says it will come back, always bursting your bubble of happiness. She had a second scan and all is ok, but still they say it will come back, and she will only live for 4 years. She is extremely careful of what she eats, she reads and reads for more and more knowledge and help from the scriptures.  I am enjoying all your albums, I’m hooked on them can not stop listening = thank you so much your words and music have brought me strength. Such creativity has blown me away, because of truth be now known.
GOD BLESS YOU
What a great artist
Rest in peace James Anthony Bell he lost his fight to luekemia yesterday October 23, 2021  At 2:07 pm. At the age of 51 years old. My best friend and body guard of 17 years. From Fresno CA. A bootboy and a Angel at his beat. I love you Jimmy and I won't lay down or let this go. Go rest Sleepy.. You did your job. And no one could have done it better.
I have cancer and this song is the best!!  I am not afraid, I'm terminal & doing immunotherapy to help prolong my life that I do to help my family have time to come to acceptance.  I trust in Jesus Christ who will stay with me throughout this and beyond!
Sad but so dam true
this song means a lot my grandma that i was very close to died to cancer when i was young. tom i love you music dont stop!
Tom!! Do you realize how God is using you!!!
His music is a breath of fresh air
Thank you young man like almoat all of your tunes
Just wanna say Tom who gave you permission to air out people like me go through? How does those millions feel in your hand bud because I've lost everything to cancer in 2018 and still fighting for my life with 0 help, meanwhile, Tom over here making millions off of my suffering?
My brother
Thank you Tom! I legit cried on this one. You have a way with words that really makes me feel something. I haven't had a music artist make me feel the emotion in a song for a long time. I am an atheist but I still want to say God bless you. I cannot for the life of me think of anything better to say to you except thank you. Love it bro.
Trillion dollar video…. And passion
I know you made this awhile ago but I want to say Thank you. I had cancer as a child I was lucky.
I am a Cancer Survivor. Little over 30 years free from it. But I still carry the scars and the nightmares. Thank you Tom for this song💒
Fight cancer with crabcakes.
He is simply amazing 🤩!!
Cancer is a virus and many forms.   I took chemo and radiation.
I have Leukemia... This one touches me deep and personal... Thank you, Tom... GOD bless
@ Tom Macdonald . You made me cry with this song.   Not for the bad but for the good in the world
I may be a Metalhead but this shit is fantastic!!! 🤘🏻🤟🏻🤘🏻
My precious granddaughter was diagnosed with ALL at 18 months. She iwas cancer free as of March 2020. She is now a beautiful healthy vibrant little girl. It was hell to get her there. Thank you for this!
The government intentionally gives us cancer. We the people need to fix so many problems including the people we allow to control us.
It'll be the one year mark since my mom passed away from cancer in a few days. This song really hit home for me.
Tom Macdonald is an honest gift on this earth ❤
They've had the cure to everything you can think of. We let them keep us sick with the poison in our food, water, medicine and air.....yet we stay asleep or mock those who are awake and desperately trying to wake us up and save us. Covid-19 is the absolute perfect example.
OMG made me cry!  Why oh why do we have to fight so hard for the basics of life!  Clean air, clean water, clean food!  Fight harder!!!  We all must fight harder!
Gershon therapy helped me over come 12-14month death sentence, 18 + years ago... big pharm has no need for cures, but individuals due. Be different. Evolve
He's absolutely right. The money's in treatment, not cures. But we keep falling for it, and donating, and hoping....
I know I will be where ever my brother is when I do go salout to you
Ugh... I'm bawling, listening to this. That was me 5 years ago. Clear now, but you really do have to be brave and positive. My only concern were my kids. We're so close, I couldn't think of the pain they would go through.  I love this song❤
I had cancer at 28 years old. Started having symptoms at 27. My doctor won’t listen to me. One day in my college class I had a tumor burst in my uterus, I almost bleed to death. I had to have a complete hysterectomy at 28 years old, because I was dismissed by doctor’s saying I was just having bad periods, take 3 Tylenol instead of 2 for pain. I had cancer. And the only option was to take everything to get it all out! I was blessed that I had already had my 3 beautiful children, because if not my story would have been more horrific! Doctors sometimes don’t listen enough to patient’s or dismiss us as if Don’t understand or know what Our Own Bodies are telling us! I knew something was wrong a year before, but no one would listen!!! My daughter is in threat of the same form of cancer I had; please pray for her! She is 34 has decided not to have children; please pray for her that she doesn’t get this disease! Thank you God Bless!
Good God this is powerful
This is too hard for me to listen too often, that why it's not as big as it should be. Much respect tho Tom 💜
Just found out my cancer is back with a vengeance. I survived it twice. Now this is my third. I will fight and burn my flame bright. I play this many times a day. Thank you Tom and nova.i did take care of mom until she passed away. I put others before myself. I hope I will be shown the same love. I looked the devil in his face and realized I have enough love inside for the strength I need . No matter what they say I will never give up.
My great Grandpa actually died from cancer a couple of years ago. Our family down in Florida never told us until we couldn't say goodbye. I'd give an hour of my life to talk to him again, even if it was just for 30 minutes. Thank you Tom for making this song, thank you. #RIPGreatGrandpa
I love you for writing this. Thank you
I am a stage 3 breast cancer Warrior and Survivor. And everyday is still a fight to own my body and life again. And everyday i live in fear it will come back in my brain or bones. THIS SONG ROCKS ME TO MY CORE. I LOVE YOU TOM. THANK YOU BROTHER!!! Thank you 😢
You the man tom👊👊
"...And you won't know why you have faith, til you look  the devil  in his face."  Nailed it.
yess i love this song:)
SICKNESS MAKES MONEY.  THEY DONT WANT TO CURE ANYTHING.  Follow the money.
This is a great 🎵 song.
Thank you, this song brings tears to my eyes every time i hear it, thinking of all the loved ones lost. Tom McDonald, thank you and god bless man, keep being you!
I have a bone marrow tap in 4 days to see what I'm about to fight... I'm terrified of the cost it will bring my family. And about to lose my job and insurance on top of it. Thank you for the hopeful song.
There was a Dr who discovered that you can kill cancer cells with certain frequencies they started making his machines then the guy who made chemo came along and trashed his name and anyone who looks into this gets laughed at
This dude straight got me bawling on almost everything @tommacdonald u may have saved my life
Tearsssss
I just lost my mom to cancer. It was absolutely devastating. I took her into the ER because she was having trouble breathing and had back pain. They ended up finding a mass on her lung and diagnosed it as stage 4 lung cancer. She passed away two weeks later. The doctor told me they could keep her alive but the insurance wouldn’t pay for it. It absolutely destroyed me to hear him say that unless I could pay out of pocket they wouldn’t do anything. My mom was a great woman and always made sure I was taken care of. To have them say that and know there was nothing I could do to help her broke me. I had just recently started listening to your music, and this song came on my pandora playlist shortly after she passed away and instantly made me break down. I don’t know if you will ever see this message but I just wanted to say Thank You. Your music has helped me keep my mind straight through all this darkness and kept me from drinking the pain away, Or something worse. I’m going to stay strong and keep fighting this stupid world no matter how many times it knocks me down. I’m glad I got your music to help me through now. Thanks Tom
Big Pharma is the Devil in disguise.
I'm just hearing  this song   as a 2x cancer survivor   this song hits right to the heart
fucking brilliant man , respect
Thank you for this song Tom and Nova  it means a lot from a survivor's family. Shawn Blake 1982- 2017
We will find about me next week after so much bone cut out biopsies and meds and multiple Dr's and scans and blood work it never ends I'M SO EXHAUSTED BEFORE EVEN FIGHTING TO LIVE ...JUST ONE DR AFTER ANOTHER SENDING ME TO ANOTHER DR.. CAN'T AFFORD ALL THE MEDS AND MEDICAL BILLS AND DR'S APPOINTMENTS....MAKES YOU JUST WANNA GIVE UP BUT I'M A WIFE AND A MOTHER BUT WHEN IT GETS SO OVERWHELMING IT FEELS LIKE WHY AM I PUTTING US ALL THROUGH THIS JUST LET WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN GO AHEAD AND HAPPEN...
Found out to late for my husband but 1TBS 100% Organic Cold Pressed Flax Seed Oil kills cancer FAST! Take it right off the spoon! Saved people whom I told & it did kill the tumor in my late husbands colon but we did not have enough time for it to kill the cancer in his lungs. Had we found out sooner I know it would have killed all the cancer. He only took the oil 3 weeks & it killed the tumor in his colon. The surgeon who removed the tumor was astounded that the tumor was dead. It saved a man I know from having his entire stomach removed, he only took the oil 3 weeks before the surgery to have his stomach removed. Doctors did a PET Scan week of surgery & the cancer was 100% gone. Surgery cancelled & Mel is alive & healthy now 7 years later. This works for people & animals! IT WORKS! I do not sell it or get paid to endorse it! Just personal experience! It must be 100% Organic Cold Pressed Flax Seed Oil!
cannabis cures cancer :)
My mom died of cancer when I just turned 8 years old. F*ck cancer. Long time sub and fan now. I just wanna say thank you, Tom. Thank you for making a song that hits close to home and for being an inspiration.
Goosebumps. Thank you.
I love this song but not this video. The chemo patient in the video still has her eyebrows, which wouldn't be there if she was actually getting chemo, and the makeup around that bald cap looks bad. I get it, you're independent with limited resources, just dropping some constructive criticism. Maybe different lighting could've covered up the fake chemo patient better. That or you could've used someone actually going through chemo, given them a chance at a dream of being in one of your videos, if that exists.
This is one of my favorite songs by my man Tom.  Keep up the GREAT work.
Preach!!
Much love ❤
This hit home... hard... lost my sister 23 years ago to cancer. My sister in law has been fighting it for the last 2 years. Hopefully going through her last surgery this year... the sacrifices that families make to fight cancer are unbearable
Just lost my dog to cancer today. He was a lab like Tom's Steppenwolf. Lost my two grandmothers two years ago to cancer. My sister is waiting on biopsies.  Fuck cancer. 😭
His lyrics are from Angels…I can feel it 🥰
Awesome beat and video 🙌 thanks man
My grandpa lost the battle on Oct. 9 of this year. His funeral was today
I LOVE YOU TOM!!!!   YOU ARE WHAT THIS WORLD NEEDS RIGHT NOW!!!!  YOU ARE HERE FOR A REASON!!!!!
This one and "Withdrawals" are REAL as it can get.
Hitting home right now... Two time terminal diagnosis survivor introduced the guy who did my cat scans and introduced him to my mom been my stepdad now over 20yrs And now he's got glioblastoma I just dread slowly watching him turn into a vegetable as the tumor destroys his brain btw I had nasopharyngeal carcinoma at 12 with reoccurrence at 15 thanks for the music
So many people doubted this guy ...hated his lyrics approach ....honestly this guys a genius !  love how true he is no matter the haters ....#TMTHETRUTH
Gifted UNBLINKERED truth this young MAN is eyes wide open x
I fear this is sad but true
Damn... 😢 mom had cancer wen I was 16. It was hard af and I buried myself in pills to numb the pain. I honestly think this song and you're music would have kept me from turning to the pills, save me from almost dying from 5 overdoses 3 years,  about $250k gone. Love you Tom. You a real artist.
That bald chick looks like a barbie
🪶
alkaline water is the cure i survived stage 3 in under 6 moths just take faith in your god and believe in my words " alkaline water is the cure to cancer "
Me and my son know where we're going when we die heaven
I was diagnosed with "terminal" brain cancer when I was 23. Doctors don't know everything. I had a three year old baby girl that I refused to leave and I made fun of my situation from even before my diagnosis was confirmed. My Mom was a basket case but refused to ever show it in front of me. I had three craniotomies, but nothing else and it came back 4 years later. I had it removed again and had chemo and radiation. I'm 40 now and it's back. My daughter is 20 and I almost feel like there's nothing left to fight for but my daughter has Asperger's and still needs me. My Mom needs me here too. This song kills me every time I listen to it and I will not play it for my Mom. I am fighting again, it's human nature but I'm so tired.  I found your music through Officer Tatum, Tom, and I thank you for every song you release. You make me smile and laugh, especially in these uncertain times. God bless you.
Tom…. Crazy amazing… what an artist… he has a gift and using it to bless us… thanks
I dont like that they put pressure on people to go through radiation though. Its like they should give people the option to fight it other ways. Or even the option to not treat it. (Ive got other chronic health problems i dont think my stomach would be able to handle that shit if I got it after all these years of other meds. )
It would have been my brothers 38th birthday yesterday. RIP brother. He died in july of melanoma.
I'll pray for all you all in the comments and I appreciate Tom Macdonald. Don't ever change bro
Who ever thumbs down this...something is wrong with u....
Cancer survivor here...I was pregnant when I found out...
Keep going Tom. Please.
VERY NICE SONG!! GREETINGS FROM GERMANY BRO
Love your BIG ❤️, young man. Keep rapping the TRUTH. 💜💚💙
The 3.5k that dislikes this Song is ppl that prob have had canser, and used radiations for there canser >.<   All they needed to to was to read up on it and not on the goverments healt site..   You can help your self way more if you got the legit knowledge.  Thanks for a great som Thomas! <3
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I know more people with cancer than I do that dont,,and it's like ever day I found out someone else I know has cancer.. FUK CANCER
my nana died of cancer and it killed me i watched he take her last breath was a second mom did everything for my mom and my two brother after my dad left my mom to raise three troubled sons and cancer took her at only 70 still cry every couple day thinking about it love this song
Amazing. I love this song. So true in every way and i hope it helps cancer sufferers everywhere. Keep fighting guys 👍👍👍
THERE'S 10,  AHCC, URINE THERAPY, ESSIAC TEA, H2O2 FOOD GRADE, O3, LOTS.  AND TAKE 1000MG C AND IT CANT METASTICIZE.  GOD BLESS YOU TOM, SAY IT.
Some cancers feed off of glucose and insulin.
When I go, I just want it to end. No heavens No Hells. See you there, not !! Fight the good fight y’all.
Right
A rap song about positivity amongst the struggle of humanity rather then negativity amongst the negativity.  I really love what your doing Tom.  Please, keep giving hope to people thru your art and dont pay any attention to the haters.
I've listened to this song 100 times probably. I haven't heard it in a month. I just cried again. Tom you're amazing. Thank you for what you do. Hangover Gang family forever!
How can people dislike this???????? I dont even understand. What's wrong with this???
Some hero's wear braids
Tom mcdonald you are truly the peoples champ. You and nova are America's true dream couple and if not you should be. One love
Sad but yes illnesses have been created by selfish rich people who only love money. God made our bodies perfect we can heal our selves by how we think. Thank you for loving humanity so much to create masterpiece after masterpiece
This touches my heart 😢 love you for making this video T .MacDonald. As a stage three Non-Hodgkins  Lymphoma survivor after three years of suffering myself. To have at one point told I only had a ten year life span to now be a survivor of 10 years and still healthy and happy I pay to god for not only how I’ve been blessed but especially for those that are still suffering or have lost the horrific battle. It’s a unreal pain and agony in every aspect that most people would never understand unless dealing with such a disease.  I also believe 100% that the corrupt, sick and money hungry ignorants that override and take over the government can release the cure that most definitely has been invented for at least most of those in need. Rare to hear of those in power dying of such diseases. Let’s se 1805 and 1963 for presidents and most government officials were Republicans huh WEIRD!!! 👎🏼😡
Rejoice
Yep call me crazy but I know there is some  Thing after this Jesus is real repent
I just want to share the cure with you all. https://youtu.be/9twptq274yk Cancer is not an illness
It's not about a cure for cancer... It's about boosting the immune system. Chemotherapy and radiation kills the patients. For some reason IG Farben has the contracts on chemo drugs. They are the same company that made the gas for the gas Chambers. They just keep recycling drugs every war, and now they make pharmecitical drugs. Cancer is a business. If you can not live as God intended us to live with a great immunes system . Free of genetically modified food and posionous chemicals they call drugs.. the cure for cancer is Rick Simpson oil (full extract cannabis oil) https://youtu.be/-acnmbTluBI You gotta invest in your health, change your diet, and exercise regularly
He is uniting us in a way that the small minded need to hear. Only wish more people wouldn't judge an engine by the paint job.
This is the he first time I’ve heard this song and I’ve listened to Tom for a while now… I can honestly say… when he said “pray that their is something after this” I don’t know why but I absolutely lost it… @Tom MacDonald never stop what your doing you bring a lot of light to a lot of people. Thank you for doing what you do.
Man, you make me cry.
This hit me so hard 😪. Thank you so much for this ❤.
One of the most powerful songs ever, only followed by all other Tom MacDonald songs. HOG for life!
Everytime I hear this song it brings tears to my eyes my aunt who raised me more then my mother did had breast cancer back I'm 2008. She beat the cancer and was cancer free until 2020 but then it came back In her bones and there was no treating it at that time. It sucks because I couldn't be there for her I had moved onto Utah while she stayed in NC and it was at the high of the covid pandemic so I couldn't even get on a plane and go see her and she wasn't allowed any visitors so you could only see her through a thick glass wall separating her from everyone else, and it just broke my heart seeing all the photos I did knowing I couldn't be there for her in her last moments so this song hits pretty close to home for me. Keep making great music tom you are inspiration
My mom died of breast cancer.  This song is beautiful. 😔😪
We need more music like this that speaks the truth and brings awareness. Thank you, Tom! I'm impressed!
In my second round of cancer. You lifted my spirits. You have a special way of telling the truth. Continue on your path. You are the Warrior we need. Thanks.
Lost my step sister at 34 to cancer. 💔 last Saturday was the 1yr mark with out her. Didn't see this til today and wish I could have played if for her.
Tom you're awesome man. Would love to meet you here in wisconsin. Bunch of like minded people here waiting for someone like you
You made me cry, man..
Thank you from a cancer survivor.  Your words are so true, chose to live like it doesn't exist.
This hits hard
13 fuel the fire of creativity that I was not allowed to use in the northern part of the United States. ...
Lost my Dad to cancer a couple of years ago. This song hits hard. Tom is a brilliant artist and knows what he is doing with all his work. Thank you for all that you do, for myself and for others. Your work is truly appreciated.
As a childhood cancer survivor THANK YOU!
Thank you for speaking the truth!!
I mean wow amazing song/video….
I'm getting ready for six weeks of radiation treatments. Thank you for this song.
This guy has feels
Amen
Thank you for this song!!! Someone must be cutting onions...
my Father is in the Fight 4 hes Life! Love you Dad i pray 4 you!!
There's been a cure for this for decades. Don't you see how this system works?
Tom I don't know if anyone has ever told you but Jesus loves you and he died so you can live eternally with him.
I lost both my dad and sister to cancer, this is an awesome song, thank you Tom
Thank you! Tom
I babysit for a family. The mom became really weak one day and found out  that she had breast cancer. She thankfully survived and is happy and healthy.
You nail alot. When you swerve outta your lane too far you're just flat wrong. Stay out of medicine. It's terrible.
what he says is true
If you thumbs down this. 🖕🖕🖕🖕middle fingers up to you!! This dude should be nicknamed THE TRUTH!
At a lose for words I can't even tell you how many of these kinds of songs you've done that hit me hard.
Big Pharma never sells a cure, they sell Meds to fight symptoms. "Every cured patient is a lost customer" Each cancer patient that needs chemotherapy is a hooked customer that earns them 100k+ $ a year ... Do the math
Wow 😢😢😢 this song is so relatable Tom you are the best music artist keep preaching to the world God bless you.
My c wife died of cancer my friend saw him waist away ! 3 sister was taken from me from HIV IN THE 80s I lost everyone I loved. I just want to scream ! I live u nicole sorry I wasn’t my self. 4 give me.
This song means so much to me. I'm A Cancer survivor.
You are an amazing Lyrical Storyteller. Thank you for this.
Tom your just amazing brother
DEEP DARK INTEL:  Trump, Biden and Pelosi are secretly trying to get Obama back in the commander's seat... And this move is and will be, the beginning to the end. The vac IS most definitely the mark... ...---...
I have been saying that we pay top dollar to kill ourselves. 😭😭😭😭🙏🙏💯🕊️
I don't have cancer. I have been diagnosed with over 36 autoimmune diseases. When I say I'm sick, I don't mean I have a cold.  Life was all about pumping medicine into my body and the side effects were so bad, that I had to take more meds to offset the other side effects. This fight is fucking hard. I quit some meds, like my happy pills and am trying to not drown in these forgotten emotions that have been suppressed for so many years. I'm awake, but God help me that I don't go back on these meds.  Damn, Tom. This spoke, no.. it screamed at me. I'm so close to quitting and I hear this song. I'm still very lost in my life battle, but this helps. Your music helps. I wonder if you even have a clue what your words mean to some of us. Much love, be safe, keep spitting the truth bars!! Please.
Thanks ♥️♥️🥰
This song hit me hard. I smoked for 28yr. To quit I tried Gum, Patches, Inhalers, Lozenges, Wellbutrin, Chantix, Acupuncture and Hypnotizing. I still couldn’t quit.  My doctor finally told me to try vapor. I couldn’t believe in one day of Vaping nicotine I quit cigarettes.  Fast forward - now the politicians, and “US” public health wants to either outlaw or tax vapor so high only people with a higher income will be able to use it to quit smoking.  Public Health England supports vapor, Royal college of physicians supports vapor and even though there are loads of studies showing it is less harmful than cigarettes the US politicians won’t listen.  No one said vapor is healthy but it is less harmful than cigarettes.  I can now run up stairs, I walk 5 miles a day and CAN breath.  I can Not go back to cigarettes. I’m not sure what I’m going to do if they outlaw it. It’s really odd - like they want us to smoke and die… 480,000 people die a year from smoking related illnesses. 😳 scary to think my life matters so little.  Thank you for your thoughtful lyrics! You are a voice that has been needed for a long time!
Brother got me like🥺, the woman that put me on to your music don't miss and Tom you certainly don't either. Much love
Just started college at 43 to find a cure for cancer. I Feel that is already been found but because of the money involved they won’t release it. If I find it I’ll make sure everyone knows and it’s affordable. It’s time to focus on each other rather than the money we can make.
My life sucks, it always has and always will and I've made my peace with that. But cancer is what took the only person who ever cared about me growing up who didn't want anything from me but to be happy. But the day that she died from cancer, was the same day all my hopes of happiness died too. I've been dead for about 20 years already, I'm just waiting for my body to catch up with my spirit or soul or mind or whatever you wanna call it.
This true a cure for cancer would put the pharmaceutical company out of business I have thought that for a long time I was a home health aide for 20 years
Lost my grandad through cancer. Great words
My bf is jealous of the fact that I am inspired by his message. He tells me I am not allowed to listen to Tom.... I am sad he does that.
I'm fighting this monster now for a few years the hardest part is knowing the poison there putting in me, I HATE IT!! CANCER IS REAL😢
I lost the strongest woman I will ever know to cancer 3 weeks after this video dropped here. My mom still visits me in my dreams and memories. I love you mom.
Tom Macdonald for president
This song just brought me to tears…
I finished treatment 2 months ago, im cancer free and this song made me cry
3.5k haters out there that couldnt have listened to this song at all. they just hit the dislike button and move on because there is no way that you heard this song, and i mean really hear it and ever think about giving it a dislike. this is such a touching song. i have recently became a fan, im a 51 year old and never been a rap fan, my son introduced me to this young man and for the last few days i have been going thru everything he has. tom has more heart and conviction than any musician i know.
There are worse things than death.
The passion you sing this song with is truly incredible God bless
i lost my Grandad to cancer 13 years ago, this song gets me every time!
Beast!
Man I love this song man and love every you do . Iv had cancer 3 times  and I'm still fighting it at mow I'm only 26 got it at 20
Fought stage 2, grade 3, triple negative breast cancer.  Had chemo and mastectomy, now waiting to see if they want to do radiation.  The surgery was a success as they said there is no more cancer.  GREAT feeling knowing I kicked cancers butt!  Thanks for this song, it’s so very true!
I am fighting cancer at this time and your song made me break out in tears. I made it through chemo and radiation now it is just 9 months of infusions.
I'm a 53yr old hard ass m/f who just heard this song for the 1st time..my mum is dying from cancer and I got tears pouring down my face.. Tom you fukn rock bro..
This is so true . I was blessed with an angel . That god called home . Within my mom whose a 3x breast survivor. Well this    pass February my mom couldn't fight anymore. This song just hits home. Cause they have a cure. But wheres the profit in that. For them . They rather watch you suffer to live. Then to help you heal.
This guy understands almost everything that is happening with this world right now… every single song is a trip to reality… you are different Tom,aren’t you?
Tom! BEAUTIFUL!! I REALLY LIKE THE CLOCK IN THE BACKGROUND WHEN SHES ON THE BED. NICE TOUCH.
11 months later Tom and I dont know if i can do it again... Im still coughing up blood tom... tom are you there
I love this guy more and more
Cancer is hard....trust me if we could cure it we would do it in a second.  I work every day to get rid of cancer and no one wants anything but to get rid of it.
Thank you so much much for this song I am battling cancer right now!!! Any prayers are appreciated they mean everything to me!!! 💯💯💯💯♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🌷🌷🌷🌷🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️
This song made me think of my mom who pass away from cancer 11 years ago I miss so much. Love the song Tom love all your songs you keeping real
How could someone dislike this?
I love that you used the same actor from "Whiteboy" to be the doctor.
I lost my grandfather to cancer on the day this song came out. Every time I find myself missing him I listen to this, and it helps. So I guess I just wanna say thanks to the void in case Tom sees this and knows how much his music means.
Dude this made my dad cry because he had cancer and remembers all of the people that cared for him
"They can't afford to end it"  The cure is healthy diet, exercise, natural air and stuff like that
I’m bawling My eyes out ❤️❤️❤️
I lost my mom and  she had breathing cancer 5 different times I miss her so much. This song makes me cry and think of her everytime I love this song and will always support anything you do Tom Macdonald
Science right isn't that the latest slogan,, follow the science🤔🤔🤔 brother, you speak truths back by facts👍👍👍 please please,,, keep on your path 👍
Dude, ya made me cry AGAIN!! I got stage 4 lung cancer, adenocarcinoma, had radiation 6 times to my brain and 33 times to my left lung… 3 years later…. Still kicking it! Probably gonna have brain surgery soon to remove a stubborn ass tumor that won’t die. That’s alright though… could be worse. Thank you for noticing our struggles, victories and losses. I’m sure there is a cure, they just don’t want us to have it. God bless Tom & Nova!!!! Keep on spreading truth!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
On my local radio there was a cancer ad, they're saying 1 in 2 will get cancer now.
I am a brain cancer survivor  I had radiation  therapy  only because  I was scared or the alternative. This song is awesome thank you I beat it and I'm alive for what in a world were being g white is almost a crime. Its not right
I truly wish my mom would have lived to hear this song she was a fighter and lived 4 years after she was told she had stage 4 lung cancer, this hits really hard for me.
Look up chlorine dioxide its been known to fight off some cancers without needing chemo. F big pharma.
❤❤❤
My mom died of cancer on august 9th 2021
How anyone can click dislike on this video is beyond comprehension !! Tom you are a true LEGEND, this just goes to show you some people in this world are soulless!!
Still crying to this song even after watching it immediately when it got uploaded. My grandma is a breast cancer survivor from before I was born (I'm 29 this month) and then just a couple months ago lung cancer got her even tho she hasn't smoked since the 80s. As well as my mother catching skin cancer all in the same month and they both survived all three, well grandma missin a boob but let's not talk about that you weirdo! 😭😊👍🏻🤘🏻 #FuckCancer ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿🙌🏻
Wow Tom everybody can relate to your lyrics no matter of their age. This one touched my heart.
I love that you made this song I lost my dad 16 years ago to cancer my gram survived stomach cancer and my mother survived breast cancer  this song is amazing
Today I became part of this statistic... This song really hits
Jesus lives! And his reincarnated name is Tom! Amen brothers and sisters.  AMEN!
😔true
I know that you'll never see this, but I still wanted to take the time to thank you personally, Tom. Sincerely, thank you so, so much. I was diagnosed with cancer at 17 and my dear friend, Matt, passed away from cancer when we were both 15. While I'm considered a survivor, cancer has left it's mark and the life-saving treatment has not only emotionally but psychically affected me, permanently. Now, at 18, I'll live in fear of recurrence and take medication for the rest of my life and quite frankly, I'm already tired. This is the song that got me through all of the pain, exhaustion, fear, surgery, radiation, and continues to get me through the days I feel like giving up. Thank you for helping me realize how much I can take. ♡
I lost my grandmother to ovarian cancer back in 2000. It's been 21 years, but it still hurts. I miss her so much. Thank you Tom MacDonald for not giving up on your fans. They need this now more then ever. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
thank you Tom my Husband is going threw stage 3 lung cancer and we are fighting every day!!
He speaks the truth. He gets it. 💯 Keep doing you Tom! This song hit home. My dad died from cancer. It was completely preventable but the doctors told him they had to follow the "procedure." Ultimately, it killed him.
F*ck cancer and the pharmaceutical industry, keep up the great songs Tom!!!
#TechnoSupport and to anyone else suffering from this disease.
I never knew my grandfather because of lung cancer. Never smoked a day in his life. I feel robbed. How does Saint Jude's continue without donations in a socialist society? Believe me, I've raced to win for St Jude's. crashed once. I rebuilt the car on my own dime, won 1st place and donated the entire $10k purse just so that a child could stand a chance and his parents wouldn't receive a bill. St Jude's is only for kids and never gives the family a bill. I cry every time I hear this song. Tom MacDonald is a legend for reasons beyond music. God has a plan for him, that's why he continues to win the fight of alcoholism. ✝️❤️🇺🇲& Tom.
So much love in this song! Amazing!
Lived thought the last six month of my father’s cancer treatment and still lost him in the end.  Thanks you for this song.
Best Song Ever!
My Dad lost his life to Cancer. He was the strongest person in my life was also my best friend. RIP Dad ❤️
Breaks my heart my little 5 year old cousin is going through this 😭 my poor baby he doesn’t deserve that. I pray for all of y’all!
Lost my mum to cancer nearly 3 years ago and that hits hard.... Great songs, Tom! You're awesome, keep saying the truth and maybe people will wake up!
So super powerful.  Thank you for that message
@Taron Dahl... I Second that sentiment totally!
They say they haven't cured cancer but have come up with a vaccine for a never before seen virus. Right! They make billions maybe trillions from cancer treatments, surgeries and donations.
This is one of your most underrated songs brother!! ... This is AMAZING Everytime I listen to it!!.... This shows the depth of artist Tom MacDonald really is!! .... The way he puts our feelings into words to express our fears, anger, joy and humor is on another level!! I write, I guess you could call it poetry, and I have a hard time finding the right words sometimes and Tom makes it look easy!! IT'S NOT!!.... Dude, I hope you actually read this, you are the man!! And this song helped lift a friend who is battling cancer and you help lift so many others up!! Anyone denying how great you are at this at this point is just jealous!! You are a TRUE artist man like I've never seen!! I hope you come out with more songs like this and I wish, castles and those types of songs along with all the other great songs you write... Because these types of songs show how great you really are!! AMAZING!!
Fuck me Tom. You made me cry. Peace and Love.
I hope anyone watching who works in the cancer ward/oncology unit of a hospital plays this song for those fighting!
1980-diagnosed april 2021.. I stand brother so is my family..living at last instead of surviving ironically.. in the NOW I am.. I get now why it's also called the present 💝 just for another day.. Thank you so much Tom💜
Love this set
Hhhhuhhh
This song really hit me.  I lost my grandfather and father to cancer and 2020 I almost died from the same cancer they had.  Lost my colon to the cancer….and my life changed in so many ways.  Some days I wish I had died instead then go through everything.  Worse part is the insurance companies hold your life in their hands anymore.  They decide if you get treated or not….it’s insane.  Thank you for this song 💙
Watching my father take his last breath and his skim go white and lips go purple so fast is burned into my brain. I WAS 7 and cant ever forget that moment. I inherited the same cancer. This song hits. Keep doing it Tom HOG4LIFE Edit: Facts insurance doesn't cover it all and it is hits the family hard.
Thank You Tom and Nova!
Thank you 💜
I had Leukemia twice as a child.... Once at the age of 2, & it came back when I was 11.... Having to be on Chemo both times, and Chemo & Radiation the second time was awful.... The second treatment rendered me unable to have children. At the end of the day I'm happy to still be on this earth, & also a wife that gave me (step) children that I thought i'd never have...
The cure is apercot seeds it's not rocket science. Well that's another story. Vitamin B17 aka amygdalin aka cyanide it's in apple seeds to just not as concentrated. A apple a day keeps the doctor away, baby bloomers had one thing right
At age 42 cancer had never touched my life. I felt like it was overblown.... then my brother was diagnosed with glioblastoma.  I did the research and knew he was done. I cried at his hospital bed that day while my family prepared his miraculous recovery.  They questioned my tears...but I knew.  My cousin is now in the death throws of lung cancer... 6 months tops. My Uncle is the same with breast cancer...yes, my uncle.  Then 2 months ago my wife  of 22yrs was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer at age 40.  She is currently winning.  Double mastectomy and chemotherapy every 3 weeks..... Damn it Tom Perfect timing with this song   Love ya brother
as someone who now has terminal cancer... this touches me deeply.
I'm a 3 time cancer survivor of 10 years... I haven't cried over my diagnosis until I heard this song!! #facts
Great message and song like always, but saying that cancer is not cured because we don't want to is as foolish as saying the earth is flat. Is way more complicated than any other disease and is way beyond our current knowledge on bioengineering. Investment is being made on stuff like CRISPR (look it out, is crazy stuff) so curing the cancer today with current tech is like asking to go to space to medieval folk.
Thank you.. so much more than you know..
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is THE TRUTH. Look into GcMAF. Look into fasting. Look into rosemarinus acid as a carrier for colloidal silver, which the cancer will welcome in as food - part of the angiogenesis - and then the silver particles can go in and kill some tumours. Look into Gerson Therapy.. Amend your diet. Sugar feeds tumours. Be the master of your own knowledge - read the work of Weston Price. Cancer charities are liars. If you have cancer, your body has become too toxic, and the last thing it needs is more toxic input - ie chemo (which hospitals are paid to use). The pharmaceutical industry is the cancer.  I would never have imagined all this could be true, until many years' journeying into finding out the truth about health, which is God given. There are demonic forces on this planet who feed from making us sick. But I think their time is running out. Trust in them is dying. I wouldn't go to a doctor - if  paid .
My husband, my dad, my grandmother, all gone from cancer. Now I'm slowly losing my mom...
This man got heart love allways
This is such a powerful song makes me cry every time 😭😭😭
I have cancer just find out 2 months ago but I’m doing better not thank you god 🤲🏿❤️
I lost one of my real good friends to cancer  two months ago. I can’t even explain how this song makes me feel. Thank you so much for it.
The cure does exist.  A world renowned research doctor told me.  There's no money in it.  I couldn't live with myself if I knew the cure but didn't tell anyone.
This made me cry.  My beautiful friend Ashley is fighting cancer for the 4th time.  This time, it's looking less likely she can beat it (here's hoping the doctors are all wrong!).  She's only 35. Mother of 3. She takes excellent care of her body.  She's such a light in this world. <3
Lost my Mom at 52 to cancer, sister at 39, and brother in law at 37.   This brought tears to my eyes thinking about them.  Just found Tom on youtube last night.  Don't know how it knew to suggest his videos to me, but I'm telling my 50-something year old friends about him.  Love his truth.
Technical she would shine brighter because our bodies naturally release some radiation that makes us glow but for her she's going to be a glow stick :V
Thank u Tom. This song helped so much. I just lost my mom 9/6/21.
Beautiful!
The very best about Tom, is you can HEAR  his words!😊  Once you HEAR him you WANT to listen. Thank you for sharing your world(s) with us because it appears many of us have (physically &/or mentally) been in many of your worlds too🥰
Amazing song brother! One of my favorites
Lost my mother 10 months ago due longue cancer. Every1 says she shouldnt of been smoking. She never did
That's wasssup
God bless you Tom
💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥😭😭😭FACTS! TOM AND NOVA ROCK 🌟✨❤️🧡💙
I'm 15 yr old and ur the only rapper o adore I ain't even Into rap
I Have THIS Ty For Doing THIS SONG
I believe cancer is Gods way to say "I'm taking you home soon, take care of unfinished business, take time to say good bye".  It's hard to imagine, but imagine knowing when you're going to die, given time to take care of things you need to or want to take care before you go, instead of getting shot by a criminal or die instantly in an accident.  Also, I thought about this: Why is there pain that cancer victims go thru - and I believe, so that it's easier to make the decision to let go instead of fighting to stay here on Earth.       Just my thoughts...
you know they got a cure. how is it possible that they haven't. Dam were dumb. for real
Love you Brother
"Our best defense is living like we do not know what cancer is fight it if you have it and pray that theres something after this" and there is something after this and it will be better in the end if you give your life to God.
Wow great man... keep it up
My brother and my aunt died of cancer
🙏pray
I love all of Tom's social commentary music, but this song is my favorite because of his message to fight and not lose hope.  My girlfriend won her battle with cancer, but her mom did not. However, her mom was given 4 months to live, but never lost hope and fought to be here for 3 years longer than they expected.  But even outside of the topic of cancer, this message is powerful.  NEVER lose hope and ALWAYS keep fighting!
Low key sounds like g easy I like it.
Thank you I needed to hear this song!! 💛💛
This song touched me. I couldn't keep from crying at work listening to this.   My grandpa recently passed from it and my 18 year old cousin was diagnosed with it shortly after. Thank you for making music that touches people
Thanks young blood for your inspiration....we just found out my girl has stage 3 breast and lymph nodes cancer her age of 48 her having no assistance of help financially or mentally but she does have me and I'll find away for us to make it.......lost my mom five years ago to lung cancer, now another love of mine is now facing this. I'm very upset....no actually angry and pissed not even sure about the man himself called God being a blessing
I held my dad's hand when he took his last breath. Hardest thing I've ever done. Lung cancer sucks.
Amen !
Powerful
As a son who cared for his mother while she wasted away with cancer, this track has truly touched my heart. Nobody wants to watch their hero fall. Tom my friend you got a heart of gold. Thank You so much for this song. God bless you brother.
JESUS IS THE WAY THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
Thanks for this song I lost my brother to cancer this year. The last of my immediate family.
🐐 GOAT
Keep the truth alive
There is something after. Have hope, seek the truth.
God may not always heal but he always loves the plan for your life may be uncertain but God and Jesus always have a plan don't give up hope. We God's people are always fighting. God loves you and is calling don't be afraid. Fear only helps the devil.
Love every song. Sometimes I get pretty stressed and sad at the state of things and this guys music reminds me the important stance of sticking it to the system. This song personal to me and then I read the comments and cried my eyes out. Very important music and message. This guys a world changer.
3.5K Fauchi sheep who blame cancer on Trump because CNN said so.....
This song always makes me choke up and get teary eyed. My daughter was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia when she was 2 years old. She fought hard, and never lost her fight or her smile. You would have never known she was going through so much because she was always happy! She is now 6 years old....almost 2 years off chemotherapy and kicked cancers ass!!
That actor deserves an award. He been in most the videos i seen. He earned it
I have a brain tumour. It is not me, I am not it. Maybe it will kill me, but it's not there I end.
How dare Tom Macdonald for pulling on my heartstrings with this song... It reminded me so much of when I went through chemotherapy... In remission now #fuckcancer and for the ones going through it keep pushing don't give up 💜.
It's true though radiation was developed on the 1880's and 140 years later hardly any progress has been made and the fact is it can damage other organs so when if you survive you can sue from complications later on. Terrible illness and gates is funding the pesticide companies that help cause this
My grandson Bentley was diagnosed with leukemia when he was 3.  He finished 3 years 2.5 months of chemotherapy on October 19th, 2020. He still gets monthly bloodwork. We just went today and all is still good. He loves your music. He is 7 years old. Mimi and I (Papaw) also love your music and the truth behind it.  My wife is 50 and I'm 52. Keep up the great work.  You are inspiring.  Thank you Tom and Nova. Thank you Hang Over Gang.
Keep spreading the truth Tom. Great song. Made me think of family i have lost to cancer.
Gah, damn, every time I listen to this the feels hit hard.....
❤❤❤
This one hit hard. Tom, you're a legend.
Omg this made me cry. Who could help me with CPTSD? After everything, now my family and I are suffering and overwhelmed... and several months have continued this way. This is a nightmare
Tom Macdonald you sir are a fucking G.
This song helped. My mom lost her fight with cancer a week ago today and it might not mean much but this song helped me. Thanks Tom.
This song hits home. The fight real the days are hard the night is long.
Lost my beautiful sister a few years ago after she fought the Cancer for 8 years that spread from one place to another to another to another. She was an absolutely amazing and kind soul and I miss her tremendously because she was my best friend. Great song, sung well, and I pray there will be healing and there will finally be a treatment to this awful disease process. So glad we found you. Thanks Tom & Nova. Very well done.
My sister die with cancer March  2021 March and it is so painful Tom thank you for this amazing videos I love all your videos I truly appreciate your songs every one's has a very great inspiration message. ❤️💪🙌👍🙏😘
I swear that cancer has a cure but they are refusing to make it.....   Oh!! Real!!!!!!
RSO CURES CANCER!!!!
I cured my cancer with RSO Rick Simpson Oil AKA cannabis oil it works not only does it kill cancer but it also stops covid fuck cancer! I ain't scared
So true. There is 100% a cure for cancer, and if it gets out, lots of bad people are going to lose lots of money. Therefore- we still die. Enslaved to the man behind the curtain and pretending not to be.
lost my dad to cancer this year. thanks for this
My momma beat lung cancer in 2020. Only to be diagnosed with brain stem cancer a month later. She lost her battle and gained her Angel wings 8-30-21😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Im growling!
My child is a cancer survivor he had one of the worst types of childhood cancer he is my inspiration in life I need to survive for him he survived for me I need him
The realest person on earth Tom Mcdonald 💯💯💯
Oh they have a cure. They, being Big Pharma, would not make any $$. Keep speaking the truth Tom.
I dig the emotion here.  I've lost several people in my family to cancer, and I am the only one in my family with any medical background at all so I got to be the one who took care of them as they were dying.  I will likely die of it myself, if diabetes or heart problems don't get me first.  I don't worry about it  Cancer isn't just one disease.  It's also what we are left with when we don't die of all the other things we used to die of back when most people were dead by 40. Pretending its all some vast conspiracy that keeps cures from happening is just pitiful.  Do you really believe that all those thousands of researchers are going "yeah, I could cure cancer and nobody I love would die of it, but I won't make as much money..." or "yeah, I am dying of cancer, but my stock is worth a lot"?   If people want to get rich off their work they become lawyers or bankers.  They don't become medical researchers.  We have found the cause of at least one cancer:  HPV, a virus that you can get vaccinated against if you are a young girl and you probably will never have to get the related cancer.  Too bad some parents listen to celebrities in soap operas and don't let their daughters be protected.
There have been people who came up with the ultimate cancer treatment which could cure anyone painlessly. But the medicine industry saw that they would lose billions with that revolutionary treatment, so they destroyed the research of the inventor and put him into jail for ' malicious medical practices'.
This song deserves a billion views and likes
Toms a good man.    That’s all I have to say about that.
Cancer survivor here. I feel for anyone going through that
It's true theres a cure for cancer out there your telling me that covid was around for a year and a half and yet I never saw no ad in tv for support the covid reaserch and now suddenly after a year of possibly unsupported reaserch there's a cure and not one for cancer yet there's billions of dollars and pounds bieng donated idk if there was a covid donation my apologies if there was all we had were I live in England was clap for the NHS that's it
Just ran across this song, so far I'm a cancer survivor guess you can't get rid of leaukimia just put it in remission. To all the folks who are going through chemo or have a loved one who is stay strong and good luck, keep fighting my prayers are with you
Jay Z the best rapper alive 😂🤣😂😂 best joke of the year. Jay Z and Eminem never made a song as good as this. Their songs full or curses and children cant even listen to their corrupt songs. Thumbs up to my brother Tom MacDonald. Love you bro
just found out my step mom has brain cancer last night. The doctor said that she only has a 50% chance of survival because of where the tumor is growing. I don't know what to do. I'm scared but this song makes me feel better so thank you Tom.
I am sitting here a blubbering mess from this video.
Who would down vote a positive message like this.  Oh big Pharma buys click farms
ALMIGHTY BLESS PLEASE!
I have 2 family members with cancer , the third has managed to fight passed , for now, thanks for music tom. keep up your good work , love from Aus
Infected to the point of being defective... Profoundly placed on the shelf in my mental library next to so many of your thought provoking truths.  Thank you for this..father stage 4 got the news this week...life starts with bang and ends in silence but the love is never muted within the realm of music.
I have stage 4 adenocarcinoma. This is the song I listen to everyday. Thank you so much for this song.
Well coming from a cancer survivor there is some truth to this song
I wish I could "like" this song a trillion times! 3 time survivor of 2 different types of cancer myself and niece that passed from ovarian cancer at 20yrs young and this hits all the right and tight spots guy! You are blessed for sure....💜
I was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia last year when the country shut down. If it hadn't been caught when it was I would have been dead in weeks. Now, I've been in remission over a year and just got a stem cell transplant 94 days ago to help keep me that way. This song hit me hard. Thank you for this masterpiece.
Sooooooooii much Truths🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My husband starts radiation treatment tomorrow for stage 3c colon cancer. I have stage 4 colon cancer. This song hits really hard.
Please PLEASE make more songs like this Tom !!!! I could listen to this chorus a billion times over an over !! So BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU
3.5k people didn't like a positive song for cancer patients. Let that sink in.
I'm telling u now, they've had the cure for cancer for fucking years...I knew someone who didn't cope with knowing he was going to die...so he did so much research & stumbled across so much that pointed to Scientists having a cure back in the 1950's I think he said...I was in my 20's when he told me about this, just over 15 years ago, I knew he was right about a lot when he talked about how corrupt the government & big pharma is, but I don't think my young self could believe pharma companies could do such a thing...   I wish id paid more attention to what he was telling me, because I would have stood by him while he exposed the truth.  I'm older, wiser & absolutely can see the world & these evil people for who they really are....They disgust me I just hope to god enough if us wake up...come together and stand up to them the time is coming...
Don't take the jabadado
Though it's not realistic of me to ask, I pray no one watching this video has to go through the pain of watching someone they love slowly stop breathing until you're holding their hand and they take their last breath because cancer killed them.
😇🙏👼💕😍🙏🙏🙏🤲
Man.... 😭 this is just beautiful! And for those fighting... Don't ever give up! From a survivor myself of cervical cancer at 23 then thyroid cancer at 36 and again at 42, my niece passed at just 20 yrs young from a very aggressive form of ovarian cancer and the kicker... she was a firefighter/emt/paramedic and 2 weeks from registered nurse😭 and she never gave up but her body had other plans so now she is helping souls on the other side... 💜💔👼 A true Angel as that was her name also😇  Keep up the awesome fantastic work guy. The All Mighty, Lord Jesus, Creator, Alla, Buddha, Spirit... has great plans for you here still. Please keep preaching!
Thank you. So many of us have gone through that hell. 26 years ago they didn't think I'd survive. I've always thought I just did what I had to do to survive, never thought it was special, but I was the first to survive that type.  The pain and fear always lingers. You never really leave that behind. The only thing we can do is have faith that tomorrow will be worth the fight.
There's nothing after this Tom. Fight for and cherish everything you love because it's on a timer.
My grandmother just lost her battle with cancer today while i was at work, 6pm my mom said... she was my 2nd mom, i was with her as much as with my mom..... her husband, my pap, lost his battle with cancer back in 97 as well.... she made the best homemade ham pot pie.... thx Tom for this song, even with my heart breaking right now and will be for many moons to come, this song will ALWAYS remind me of my gram n pap, love yah Tom n Nova #HOG4LIFE #FUCKCANCER #THEYDOHAVEACURE #MONEYRULESTHEWORLD
Blows my mind how creative this guy is on top of the sick rapping
Best rapper ever
Change the world tom
TRUTH
black doctor !! ???? and a nurse? !!! buhahaahhaha
Keep burning bright. 🔥 Much love to you.
After my brother died at age 28 (not from cancer but other horrible diseases that took his life fast) I'm not afraid of dying I'm looking forward to it. I'm sick of this world
Fuck cancer.  Love this song 💪🏽🇺🇸👏🏼
As someone who HAS lost my mother, father and sister to cancer; the opening line immediately crushed me. Thank you Tom! You are the voice of our generation and your messages are timeless.
Rip Dr Sebi they silenced you and will hear your story💯💯
I feel bad for people my mom had cancer but she fought it so can you
Just had cancer. Doctor removed it. Now they find something else. When does it end? Thanks for the music, Tom
THIS LITRALLY GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
Project paperclip brought the nazis over after WW2 to to USA and created big pharmakeia industry. ODD TV; Pharmakeia, Illusions, They Live We Sleep, spinning ball
Great song! And so true! And really real! 👍👍👍👍
Can I get a 10 piece chicken nugget with a large fry and McFlurry
Love this song
Thinks tom as a cancer survivor my self need that great song
My grandad died of cancer. We were told he had 6 months, but he died 3 weeks later. It was 4 years ago on Tuesday
My wife has stage 3 Brest dude I teared up when I heard this! Keep it up bro you got this! Your all ready famous to millions! I been binge watching your music thumbs up all the way.
There are cures...but no money in the cure...like you already know...or world is controlled by sociopaths.
the ppl that dislike this...smh
I'm 51 years old man and I lost my mom to brain cancer I watched her turn into some kind of alien
DEAR TOM. My son was 2 when he was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer every word you said in this song hits me so hard but this aint your only song that has inspired me. Idk if you will ever see this but plz keep doing what your doing an by the way my son is fighter and survivor. Thank you
I love him!!!!  Truth truth 🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸
the global machine has created a well informed christian counterculture and that is a culture to fear if you are a tyrant
I miss you aunty B you were the light of our lives RIP
Beating cancer is a miracle.  I know I had it in my brain I fought and beat the most vicious killer 8n history cancer. This song is perfect.
I am a ten year strong brain cancer survivor  it was and still is a long horrifying  ride. Thank you for this song
Can someone who dislikes this song please explain why? I would really enjoy your point of view as to why it earned a dislike
I have anaplasitc thyroid cancer... I have  no hope .. no help .. and no family
Too close sometimes. Love u Tom *sniff*😥
WE GET CANCER FOR KEEPING ALL OUR DEMONS A SECRET. YO
My wife is fighting and this song hits home..
I'm just seven years old so I don't know what that means but its an awesome song I always listen to this song and I'm a super tom fan
Imagine the recognition he must feel after having written such a song, and coming here to read the cancer patients comments about how much you helped them Tom!  Tom I think you understand the magnitude of what you have created.  This song wasn't written for himself or for money and fame. It was written for the millions of people who battled and are still battling cancer.
<3
Mr Macdonald you did it you made me cry I lost a lot of family and friends because of this disease. God bless all the people going thru cancer keep fighting your strong
Praying for my daddy right now.. had a bad reaction to chemotherapy and hes in the ER. So hard to know he's suffering and can't be there because I'm Covid positive right now.  🙏🙏🙏
This song hits me different now. Cancer killed my brother last year then my mother died a month later. But now I lost a kidney to cancer last week and will have treatment for my lung soon so this song is like a theme song now.
It's crazy how many people give this guys songs a thumbs down and leave him shitty comments when he speaks the truth about stuff.
Are you capable of putting out a bad track?
Can't LOVE this song enough!!!
they wont allow it to be cured... they know the population has to be controlled... im not defending that decision... i just see. it.
i thought all the money in the world would cure my mom's MS, her treatment ended up making her even more miserable with all those damn side effects. im glad she aint suffering no more.
RSO works ...
I cry every time i hear this song, my dad has it, and I'm scared daily, your songs help me through my life. You're a hero tom, you give me hope.. I love your music and the journey you went through to get here is amazing
Ill say it again....This. This right frikkin here is what music should be like and make you feel. If you are listening to artists that dont provoke at least 1 emotion from your with their music or dont have a message that is worthwhile in their words then you are listening to the wrong artists and music. Straight up. I feel every single emotion this man conveys with his music and words. There should be more like him. When he and Nova linked up it was a blessing to us all.
Who the f thumbs down this video. You have no idea what these people go through. Pray that you NEVER have to face this demon cancer!
I just found you , I can't believe how talented you are !!!!!!!!!!! Thank you ❤️
Fuck where did you come from ?  My god thank you
Oh u ain’t never lying !!! Lol I had 2 stage 4 cancers  “incurable “ God healed me in my room  And then showed me the truth  🤦‍♀️  We’re poisoned on the daily from the ones who we set above us !
This is a lousy year.  My cat died in my arms in June. One of my geese died in my arms in July.  I was just diagnosed with cancer I had fought twice before, but because it's been 9 years since I was declared a "Survivor", it's considered a whole new cancer. Yay. My surgical oncologist wants to undo and redo the entire surgery, just in case.  It was definitely a Monday.  I don't necessarily agree with all of the statements made in this song - I trust my doctors and the medical professionals who do their jobs no matter what is going on, and I don't think there is a "cure for cancer" because there isn't any given anything that causes cells to mutate into cancer. You can cure one type or one cell type, but there will never be an overarching Cure. I think we should keep researching and looking for cures, but there won't be a shot or a pill to solve the problem.  I wasn't supposed to have this cancer. I had none of the known triggers, none of the known behaviours that are the usual culprits. The tissue that the cancer had originally grown on was completely removed and replaced with tissue from a different part of my body, so it's not the same either. The cancer formed on the new tissue, as if to say that it's going to keep coming back Just Because. I'm not supposed to have this particular cancer right now. At All.  Things happen; sometimes horrible things, sometimes good ones. All we can do is pick ourselves back up and keep going. I'm going to beat this cancer, and then I'll get my 2nd Dan for my martial arts school. It'll take me at least two, maybe three years, but I have a goal and I know I can do this. It took me 6 years to get my 1st Dan. Two years will be easy.
😮😮😮😮👌👊😭
Thank you for this song. For awhile now I have believed that they have a cure for cancer but don't want to tell people because of the money it makes. It makes me livid because I watched my dad, my hero and the strongest man I've ever known, get so weak, most days couldn't even get out of bed. Chemo and radiation did nothing to help him. He died 4 days after my 15th birthday. Thank you for this
To all those going through the struggle, stay strong through the darkness, even when things seem blink, do what you need to keep a positive mind set because no madder what they tell you, you can make it, this is from one 3x cancer survivor to another who needs to remember to stay strong, keep a positive mind, you can survive this struggle no madder how blink it seems
My wife is a cancer Nurse... She feels broken everyday... There needs to be emotional support for the providers, families and patients.
Diagnosed with P.V 4 mos ago
someone I know went threw it ag age nine beat it but it gave him a tumor in his brain no one knew until this year it was the size of a baseball they were lucky to find it in time and I died inside I didnt want to loose my bestfriend
Go vegan or 3 months and the cancer goes away but no one will try or listen so sad smh
How can you not love this. Tom, you are doing great things with your talent. Everyone had a song thru life that touched them in a certain way, but nobody can constantly put out such great content on a regular basis that touches so many so much like you do. Tom, youre an inspiration, you bring so much truth and so much hope. I never commented on anything from you tube until I found your music, now I find myself commenting regularly. The world is blessed to have you in it Tom.
57 year old man Balling like a 5 year old. Dammit Tom!
Not gonna lie, this one makes me cry like a baby everytime I watch or hear it. Great track Tom!🔥🔥👏🏻👏🏻🙌💚
Bro we have all cute to all disease
💖
My aunt quit smoking 7 yrs ago and during the pandemic she beat lung cancer- I lost my mom on July 8 2021 to breast cancer, she made it to her 62nd birthday on July 7th and passed the next  evening. I'm just now finding this song- thanks for making music about real issues Tom. Keep on keeping on.
Song gets the emotions going.... keep it up tom
My mom died of cancer, this song hits home. Beautiful.
My father died of Lung Cancer at 61. He never got to retire & the man worked 2 full time Jobs a night & day then a weekend job to put his 4 kids thru private school. The factories he worked in gave him lung cancer. We begged him to do Cemo he was stage 4 they gave him a year he died in 6 months I wish we never talked him into cemo. It took his quality of life. This song is so true Tom
This is a great song and actually made me cry considering my grandad died from lymphoma 2 weeks ago

This song is awesome!
This should be viral for all the right reasons.
Bro is  there anything you can’t say? Everything you spit is facts or your opinion and it’s truth !! You are truly one of the best mc
My grandson was just diagnosed with brain tumor that was removed along with brain matter. It’s benign they said but it’s changed him. He’s age 7 and he’s a fighter like his grandpa.
Awesome!
This song always makes me cry.  I've lost so many people to cancer.  Most painful was my daddy.  😭
I sure don't feel like a survivor :( :(
I started my battles in 2009 at 18 yrs old at beginning of my senior year in high school, but I still was able to graduate on time at the end of the year while undergoing Chemo every 2 weeks.  I tried to be private about it but it was hard to hide my port swimming in Gym class.  Found out I had relapsed in 2014 two months before my first child was born, was thankfully able to delay treatment until a month after she had been born.  I still was able to take good care of my baby daughter while feeling like hell after Autologous Stem Cell Transplant. I still have many long term side effects I deal with to this day. Tom speaks truth when he talks about cures being suppressed.  These drug companies love cancer drugs poisoning our bodies, the amount of money they make off of this is bonkers, and often brings them into relapse or secondary cancers.  It keeps people coming back to line up their pockets more.  One of many reasons I don't have faith in the jab, it just brings me Deja Vu. Cannabis during these treatments was a Godsend for me, and I do think it is plausible that it often helps people's prognosis.
If tom, Eminem, nas, tech and a couple others fell off the face of the earth rap would instantly go full caveman with the only word you'd be able to understand being pills and the moral of each song being to go into debt for chains and clothes.
Tom and Dax, are the only rappers that, know what they're doing. All their songs 🔥👌😢. God bless you, #Jesus🙏
Man you made a grown ass man cry. God bless you and real artists like you.
Truuuuth
So true... Sad but true
This instrumental on this is so good tom. Love it, we know.why we can't fix things, U ever  ▶️ monopoly?
Just got introduced to your work this past week and MAN this song hits home in so many ways. Although I’ve never fought cancer myself, I’ve lost so many dear friends and family to it - one a few months ago, in fact. I don’t know if you have either, Tom, but you put so much heart into this, it truly shows! God bless!
Too many friends with cancer.. could not finish watching after she bust out the clippers..... will finish another time... damn tom
Gonna be blaring this on repeat today. Found out this morning lost another friend last night to cancer. Fuck cancer!
@FoxNews please show this song on your news PLEASE
It took my husband 2years ago all for money WTF🤬🤬🤬🤬
Love you Tom, I hadn't heard this one before...thank you, I went thru chemo & cancer surgery last year, cancer free now. Your words & your ability to communicate thru your music is a true blessing!!
My adolescent dog died of cancer at 10 years old in 2015. It was one of the hardest losses, comparable to a loved one of course. It took me 2 years to get another dog. Little guy is 4 now and was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma. I'm broke in so many ways and a radical change is coming in life, then this... After Cloe, now Sol? Cancer and big pharma/veterinarians preventing viable treatments for it are real evil...
Thank you Tom 🤗
Our medical, justice and political systems are FD! Thank you for speaking for those of us who aren't so eloquent with our words! Much love
Jesus, Im crying.
Thank you Tom. Sincerely.
Tom you are amazing!
Yeah he's brilliant I don't even like rap but I like him
I recently watched a 9 part documentary called The Truth about Cancer, WOW, was it ever eye opening! This couple literally travels all over the world to study every treatment used  by doctors all over the globe treating cancer patients. You wouldn’t believe how many natural things are out there to help all different kinds of cancer!! For example, cancer cells begin to die when the body reaches a temperature of 102.7 . How crazy is that? My dad was so sick & in such pain from the chemo treatment, that he never got a chance to complete his bucket list. That’s just not the way to leave your life, it’s not fair ! And the money the medical cabal makes is disgusting, all while the patients suffer. Check out the documentary if you know somebody going thru the cancer journey, I honestly think chemo would be my LAST choice now if I got the big C. Too many healthier healing remedies that build up the bodies defenses, but have been shunned and silenced by the medical mafia for decades.  Only WE can bring big pharma stock down and crash their quotas. It’s time..cancer has taken way too many of our loved ones! It’s too late for my dad, but I pray that somebody will be helped by this. WAY TO GO TOM 🌟 YOU ARE A WARRIOR OF TRUTH🌟
40 years of research but they got this vaccine for covid 19...
My grandpa gave me the best gift before lung cancer took him... July 4th (navy man & patriot), while eating supper he looks up at me (he's lost 50lbs) & says Nick, Im scared! Naturally I respond Im here for you blah blah... Then "the gift", he looks up at my thinning scalp & says again "Im scared"😂💪. I said I'm terrified, lol. His 21 gun salute burial was held one day before my birthday.  Prayer's to all with cancer & the family.
Cancer is a deficiency disease. This has been known outside the medical community for years. There is a deficient vitamin in the typical modern diet. It is found in the B complex known as B17. It is shunned by the AMA and the medical 'experts' because they are told what to think and how to treat... Cut, Burn, and poison (surgery, radiation, and chemo) are big money makers for the industry. And it is a for-profit industry. A simple vitamin therapy would put them out of business because they chase the symptom and not the cause. There are many vitamin deficiency diseases like Scurvy (lack of Vitamin C), Rickets (lack of Calcium), Beriberi (lack of Thiamine), Pellagra (lack of Niacin), etc. B17 is found in several plants that we have destroyed through refining and bleaching. For example, B17 found in Sorghum molasses, and buckwheat, have been replaced with sugar and bleached white 'enriched' bread. The vitamin is found in the seeds of plants and in certain grasses. The highest concentration of B17 is found in the kernel within the pit of the apricot. But it is also in the seeds of prunes, apples, etc. A cancer cell is 'activated' when we lack this vitamin. Supplementing with B17 will stop the growth of cancer and neutralize it's destructive behavior. A cancer cell (aka trophoblast) also serves a purpose in the body. It is the trophoblast cell that eats away the wall of the uterus so the dividing embryo has a place to attach. Once the developing baby starts to have pancreatic function the cancerous process is halted. Cancer is cancer. It is just labeled differently because of the different microscopic appearance of tissues. It will manifest itself when the body is weak and deficient in nutrients. They are not different 'kinds' of cancer. It is the same destructive process found in different locations. We have these 'inactive' trophoblast cells throughout our body. The medical model for treating cancer is like taking an apple and cutting it in half and leaving it out on the counter. The exposed apple without it's protective 'skin' turns brown due to oxidation. The answer for the medical profession is to cut away the brown part. Well then what happens? ... It turns brown again doesn't it? ... The cause of the apple turning brown is that the removal of the protective skin allowed the 'meat' to be exposed. Cancer is no different. The controlling factor for the trophoblast cell to become 'active' is from a deficiency in B17.... The body's guard is down and cancer will show up in some location if not several. You will find that every search related to the medical profession will call this quackery. Of course they will. Because you cannot patent a vitamin. It is a natural cure. There is no money to be made. It is an ugly industry and people are dying needlessly.
PDYCHOTRONIC PTISON
they don't want to tell us bout the cure of cancer cause the population is very high and they think this is the way to decrease it
Truthfully speaking,  I'm not your biggest fan,  in fact barely a fan.  But this song touches my heart and hits close to home. This song makes me "feel" something and that means "you" made an impact on my life,  thank you...
This is litteraly one of the best songs ive ever heard.  HOG
yooo been diving down the Tom McDonald rabbit hole and that hole keeps getting deeperr with everry track I listen to
True Story. :) Love it bro x
Cancer can not survive in a high vibrating vessel.. Disease only lives in a low vibrating body.......research how to raise your frequency.  Read 'Dying to be Me' by Anita Moorjani.
9 years Ive survived after cancer my Dad passed away last year due to complications from cancer this song is Beautiful thank you.
Know Jesus, Know PEACE...No Jesus NO PEACE...Wonder where you'll go when you die? I DO NOT FEAR DEATH.
🙏
Ouch that hurts
Thank you Tom
Jesus Christ is real there is  more u got to believe in him an only him tho u must be baptized and live according to he expects you to. Jesus can heal all and will if u believe in him and him only. If the devil is real so is Jesus Christ. That's how the devil was created. The Lord Jesus Christ rules the devil and can destroy him. Like the bible says even the devil trembles at the name of Jesus Christ. Hr trembles and sickness came when sin did. Sickness is hand and hand in with sin. The Lord will heal u if u turn to him and trust in him. Jesus Christ is the only name under the heavens with the authority to save us. And his name only.
People dont have to die on cancer, Most doctors dont now how to handle it, its all bout Money with that☹️✌️
Genius! Love it!
This hit home and hit hard - lost my mom and both sisters to this insidious disease
I've never been through cancer but im sincerely crying
Your last few songs have said exactly how I feel. Great fucking work bud. Keep it up
They have the cure, and only the rich get it,fuck pharma, thank you Tom, there should be more ppl in the world like you:)
Wow. I’m on the verge of tears. Cancer took both my grandparents. Grandpa hurt most. I saw him transition. The strong male role model I looked up to, the man that taught me so much. The man that told me I know you didn’t get closure with your dads passing but I love you enough I want you to have closure with me. Then visiting him in the nursing home seeing how frail he’d become...a shell of his former self. It was probably best I found out later how they treated him there or I’d be in jail for breaking some staffs limbs. Then that call. 4:10 in the morning saying he was gone. I stood at the door for about 5 minutes. I didn’t want to see the other side. I didn’t want to know my hero...my role model was gone. Hearing his daughter tell him please go find mom & brother...we’ll be fine...it’s ok to stop fighting.
I LOST MY CANCER OCTOBER OF 2017..!!! THIS WOULD HAVE OUR  MANTRA..  YOU ARE ALL UP IN MY HEAD... FUCK YM... NEVER STOP BRO
Colon Cancer killed my daughter in law at 36 , then killed my Son who lost the love of his life, he couldn’t cope :(
Wow, what a great song.
How many times did it take to get through the complete verses?   This hits hard.
I can't even begin to describe what the song says to me.  I have stage 4 prostate cancer.  I can't pee on my own, I need a catheter. The radiation has caused my bowels to release at the worst times. I have no family. I sleep alone on a bare mattress because I just don't have it in me to make the bed up.  But you're right, I do want to live.  Most every morning I wake up with the dry heaves. Doing this alone is my cross but I appreciate your words.  I do want to live but damn it's so hard some days.
I watched my mother dye of cancer and chemo and it not kewl ... Thankyou Tom for this song
This song is so powerful. It made me cry. My son is a fighter survivor.. He was 5 when diagnosed and now he is 25. Thank you.
The treatment will kill you faster than cancer. My mother died of brain cancer after two surgeries. It ate thru her entirely bones and all in two months. We need to come together and say no more to this government control and elitist shit. We are giving away our lives for nothing. PROTECT THIS MAN!!! We need Tom
Strength, Reminds me of #nightbirde #hangovergang This song means so much to so many Thank you #tommacdonald
Tom you will probably never even see this comment but on the off chance that you do I just wanna say that you have helped me so much, my wife has been fighting a battle with cancer for almost 8 years now and I have fought side by side with her through everything. Now she dosnt have much time left, maybe a few weeks if we are lucky... This song more then any has given me strength every day, I hope you know that your music touches people and helps so many of them in their darkest hour... From the bottom of my heart thank you.
Whether you have cancer or not, this song is relatable to all of us. Love you Tom YOU ARE MY HERO
There are actually MANY natural alternative treatments that can eliminate all types of cancer with little to no side effects. There's B17, Rick Simpson Cannabis Oil, MMS, Essiac Tea, The Gerson Protocol, etc. These treatments have been around since the beginning of time, way longer than Big Pharma's poison chemo, before the billion dollar cancer industry was created to make bank. Don't fall for the mainstream Big Pharma BS. They're more interested in billion dollar profits than a cure.
This should have more views.
Love this song. This hits home. My mom didn't have cancer but she was pretty sick with Multiple Sclerosis. As little as I can remember I was always helping her out and taking care of her. She died august 10, 2019. Im happy shes at peace not suffering, but I miss her so much. Im still a kid yk and I need my mom. She was my best friend. She was absolutely the strongest woman I knew. Despite her being sick she cared and loved me dearly and was the best mom in the entire universe.  Thank you tom for making such awesome songs don't understand how you get the hate you get.
https://youtu.be/tL7PDXcVGuE Amen brother tom ..keep on shining your light in to this world and they will find you tru feelings 🙏🙏🙏 amen brother
Thank you for doing this song about cancer. X
God bless you dude.
Chemo is still used because Doctors make the most money from it... Chemo killed my grandmother...
Chemo is 3% effective
Been there.....given 6 weeks in 2015. My daughter pulled me out of the abyss. I was blessed with so many that lifted me up. Thank you Tom......thank you  Update****Well another type directly related to the other cancer treatments.......Tom has always spoke the truth.....
My dad sent me this song we arent on great terms right now though. I'm battling stage 3 Renal Cell Carcinoma with Cervical cancer as well had a huge operation back in April to remove my Cervical core, Fallopian tubes, adrenal gland and to receive direct radation to my Kidney. Still battling but I'll survive it.
Just lost my papaw... it’s been a year July 23rd he has pancreatic cancer, he was in such good health that they talked him into surgery... he did fine, they got all of the cancer... he got a post op infection & they let him lay for 3 1/2 days before doing anything about it but it was too late. We later found out from his oncologist that he had a 2% chance of making it through the surgery, the surgeon didn’t tell us nor him that, I can’t thank you enough for this song. I wish they cared about us, I wish they cared about our loved ones, I wish they cared no matter your age. Love you Tom & Nova, thank you.
I lost my mom to this shit. I'm glad you made this song. It's been needing to made for a long time.
My sister passed away from metastatic breast cancer today 🎀 😢
My dad is a 6x cancer survivor since 2013. This is a man I’ve seen work some days from before sun up to after the sun went down. This cancer has kicked his ass and now he’s on dialysis fighting cancer still. This is a man I’ve looked up to most of my life. And it has and is taking its toll on him. He’s mentioned a couple times how he’s losing hope and dialysis sucks. Tom, thank you for making this song. It hits different than anything I’ve heard before. To those who are battling cancer, or have a loved one battling, I’m here for you. You are in my thoughts and prayers.
FROM A 3 TIME SURVIVER, THANK YOU🙌. RADIATION & CHEMO FUCKED ME UP SO BAD. I'M STILL HAVING SURGERIES & NEW ISSUES, 3 YEARS AFTAH MY CANCER REMISSION.... SOMEBODY'S CUTTING ONIONS, 🙃 I'M NOT CRYING YOUR CRYING💪💪💪🤘🤘🤘 STAY STRONG ALL YOU BAD WARRIORS . FUCK CANCER
Lymphoma survivor, so true, in the UK we get free treatment but one of the doctors made a point of telling me roughly how much it cost, big pharma playing with our lives.
Respekt from SWEDEN!!!
2 years cancer free today thanks Tom and HOG gang!!
Fuck 3.5
Lost my mom in 18 and my pops on Dec 2020. Shits crazy. I watched them be killed by the very ones meant to protect them. I had to trust the docs when my son was born at 1.7lbs. With CV19 out now. Ill cling to the Father above then run to a doctor
Who the F would thumbs down this video? I'm mind blown.
i had cancer and my mom fighting cancer now i bet mine but mite be back tell u the truth im scared to get checked . at the age of 18 i try to join  the navy and they found it.and i beat it . now my mom has lung cancer. to who out there fighting cancer if u fight with all u have u can beat it too. it be hard some days but hang in there. u will really see what u are made of and how strong u really are most people will not know but us that have had it knows . and for my mom her cancer meds cost 30k a month and i paid for them til i was broke and had i called my x boss and he made a few calls and got the co-pay to 0 for them
Got a vaccine for a novel corona virus in less than a year but decades of research and billions of dollars and still no cure for cancer. The people are awakening to many things at once.
Thank you for this song. I lost my best friend 3 years ago. Over 15 years we were best friends. She started feeling ill and went do the doctor a few times but they kept saying nothing is wrong with you. She felt sick for 3-4 month then one day started to vomit and feel even worse.  Did then go to ER. They immediately found a brain tumor. Operated it only 2 days after and got it all out. Still needed radiation tho died 2 month later from some infection. Everything went so fast. She made the 27 club so typical her. I miss her everyday and every minute. Still talks to her everyday… fuck cancer and all carcinogen shit in this world.
Makes me tear up every time I hear it.  I have  family members who have had cancer.  Some survived it some didn’t so this really touches home.  Love the song and your work.
Wow...Each one of your songs touch my soul for a different reason.  When a blazing light is ignited in the vast darkness it will take some longer amounts of time to adjust their vision. I love how you take what the haters say and use it to fuel your artistic expression. Much love to you and Nova both.
Thank you
I heard this song for the first time today. My grandpa died of cancer. His voice sounds like mark hopus at times in this song. Which makes my heart hurt because how sick he is now with cancer of all things. God bless you Tom
🔥🔥🔥
Thank you for this. I just lost my brother 3 weeks ago to pancreatic cancer. Lost my mom in January to Covid. 2021 sucks.
It hurts to listen.  Lost my dad in 2007 to it.  He's wrong about one thing .. we know damn well where we're going after we pass on.
Profound
Their is a cure for cancer, it’s not a RX drug but something much better to do to beat cancer. If you want to know more just ask!
Is There Any Emotion That You Don't Touch On? Dang, Bro. Soooo Damn Heart Wrenching.
Took me a minute to come and listen to this. Hardest thing I've ever done was bury my 3 1/2 year old son that CANCER took from me. Big Pharma doesn't care about a cure, they just want your $$$. All the $$$ in the world couldn't have saved him.  I would have sold my soul to trade places with him. It hurts but I agree with what you have said here Tom. All one can do is fight until you just can't.  🖕 CANCER!!✌❤
Thank you for this one Tom. I think of myself as a tough Mfer but I can’t watch this one without tearing up. 😢
Never will get to meet my wife’s father, esophageal cancer took him when she was 11, oldest of 4. Had to grow up quickly without her dad to help look after her younger 3 siblings. Apparently he was the nicest and hardest working guy around… he made them furniture that they still have, letters, and principles to live by. My wife tears up during father daughter dances at weddings; she danced with her younger brother for ours. It really just makes me want to be the best man I can, that rock and good influence that he clearly was for her and their family.
2 time cancer survived love the song brings hope to many who still fight !
I Love this song. I don't have Cancer, but I do have Lupus and was on chemo to treat it. What a disaster. Now after getting an infection in my spine my back broke and I have rods holding me together and am stuck in a wheelchair. And now I have to go to the hospital because I got pressure sores and one is so bad I have a hole in my leg I can put my finger in. My PTSD kept me from going to the hospital months ago so I was treating it myself, but it is too far gone for home treatment now. I died last surgery and now I need surgery again and I am afraid, But I am A FIGHTER, I AM STRONG.  So I am going to wheel into that ER and face what ever comes my way even if it includes needing a hip replacement because the infection is in the bone.  Thanks for the great videos and music it has helped me more than you can know. Thank You.
I was just recently diagnosed with spinal cancer and man this song just hit me like a hammer.. You nailed it!!
I just found your page last week. Thank you for this song❤️. My Momma lost her battle with cancer 10 years ago and I miss her everyday 💔. You had my crying buckets😭😭
My mom's currently going through leukemia, thank you Tom macdonald, this shit kills
No onions here but the tears are for real.
I going to be honest here...I love the message and love the songs you sing....but are you real? Sooo many times there is a hook and I’m not going to lie I truly want to believe in who you are...I love all of the songs but I used to be a diplomat and I don’t really trust anyone anymore.
Why would you down vote this? Beautiful song.
My Aunt Cindy died when I was only 10 of lung cancer and still wish she was around, not only for me but for my family and people that loved her.
“Cancer has a cure, they’re just refusing to make it”.He knows.
This song hit harder than I was expecting. Thank you
this one hit home just found it and im in tears , my aunt died of cancer a little over a year ago. RIP aunty sharon may you fly with the angels. <3 <3 . thank you tom
This one hits hard. I love it and I hate it at the same time. I dont think I will listen to it again, it hurts to much.
I was diagnosed with lymphoma cancer stage 4 last year unfortunately my cancer spread to my kidneys last month I founded out
I was 6yrs old, watched my father go from indestructible hero to taking his last breath. I miss you, Dad.
The cures exists. But they get rich off our pain, illness, and hope.  They can't get rich if your healthy. Example As the saying goes you are what you eat. Food come in to categories Alkaline and Acidic Disease CAN NOT survive in a Alkaline environment  Diease thrives in a Acidic environment  Look up lists of Alkaline and Acidic foods then determine when your sick what your eating is wrong. I've heard stories of people who were diagnosed with cancer dying cancer free because the chemo destroyed their organs.  Research vitamin B17 it fights cancer but for some reason its illegal in the US....I wonder why wink wink (only place I've found it is on Amazon) I don't have cancer I take as a prevention.  Ignorance can be educated you can't fix stupid  Nobody's fault if they're not telling you the truth.
There is truth behind the lyrics, anyone who's known, remembers, or currently dealing with cancer knows that it tears at the heart, the emotion I get from this was I should have been more present when my foster dad passed from cancer, but due to his appearance I couldn't bring my self to see him suffer. So anyone that's currently dealing with this kind of thing don't make my mistake spend as much time with them because you never know if they'll make it.
Thank You I've gone threw that...
ty for this song!! touched me deeply on diff levels
Tom you have given some one hope and  courage who is fighting cancer,thenk you for this song
it took my mom
My prayers to anyone that has heard the words "you have cancer" from a doctor.
Dr. BURZYNSKI is a hero and big phar-ma at-tacked him (gee I wonder why)  but the people he was helping were winning the battle and are cancer free.  His "film" in theaters went nation wide years ago...but did you hear of it? NO!   The title of videos and film "CANCER IS SERIOUS BUSINESS"  Look up the videos unless they took them down!! Corrup-tion runs deep so do your homework on the co-rona-virus and the vac-cine! Check out the creater of "mRNA" thats in the vac-cine...he is honest and straightforward B-I-G Phar-ma doesn't want to lose.$
Fk Cancer
I just lost my grandma to stage 4 ovarian cancer. 💔
Condolences through all those afflicted
Man, I love these music videos, Tom's messages (all of his messages!) and the comment sections.   His comment sections are full of the kindest, most sincere people on this earth.  Seriously. Tom helps us restore faith in humanity
As someone who recently had to hear the news about their grandfather getting cancer. At first I was like yeah, he'll beat it...but as time went on, it slowly kept getting to me...  I'm just an emotional wreck these days, and I wish I could change it for him...he's literally been my father figure forever. It just hurts...  Why do the kindest people always have to be dealt this hand and suffer...  It is time for change, for all of us...   So thank you Tom, for being real about all the music you do.
Such a strong message in this song!  No matter how many times I hear this song it touches my heart.  Keep up the positivity yo
Look into Dr Bernski curing cancer. He and his cured patients appeared before Congress. The AMA shut him down. Not allowed to offer the cure to America.
Grown man and still cry every time I watch this.
I lost my best friend to cancer when I was 7 and I never saw some as strong as him he always had a smile on his face he kept fighting everyday till the end…..this song is gold more people need to listen to this song to know the struggle
You have a gift!!!!!....   Love you....   Keep it up!!!
I lost my godmother from lung cancer 2 years ago. At 56yrs old  My great grandmother battled breast cancer and lost both breasts and lost to  pneumonia 3 yrs later.  At 88yrs old  Edit ( they both refused chemo)  If i could stab cancer i would.
And he sent me this song before he went
My dears friend just died from cancer 27years old beautiful home 2 young boys ...
Mr Tom.. this song hit me the hardest
I love this song
All the symptoms want sick people.  They dont care that's why radiation/chemo they give is poisonous and they know its killing people because it kills everything in body good or bad and after radiation chemotherapy, that's why they give a life expectancy around only five years( may last a little longer) after being treated for cancer, also.  Now lets say I have cancer, maybe alternative medicine may help. Without chemo/ radiation etc. How do you know that without that you may could  have a better chance to live for 10 -20 years if only you didn't take those poisons.
Cant stop shading tears while reading through these comments, Lord yr are living in pain😢😢
From 2times lukemia twice stem cells transplant am a still  down go down out without a fight if I can you can Godbless you All stay strong tough 😜
If they cured cancer or other diseases, they would get a lot less funding.  The medical industry makes money off of sick people, not healthy people.
I just battled Stage 3 lung cancer and kicked its ass. This video is so inspiring. Can you tell us what made you do this song?
You are 100% correct, Tom. There is a cure they are hiding.  RESEARCH AUTOPHAGY. It is too easy. Stop eating, extended fast. The body has an "emergency" mode where it will start eating all damaged tissue.  Free. Easy if death is your other option. No doctor needed, but Dr. Annette Bosworth (Dr. Boz on youtube) can tell you more if you are interested.
Wonder why Marijuana was banned? Reefer madness
i lost my farther cancer last month  he had stage 4 skin cancer he had on his brain lugs all over in the end we only new he had cancer for 6 weeks as never like going two the doctors worse new Any one can have all i can say if see any thing on ya body get it check out as could save ya life
I had to watch my little brother deteriorate, and eventually die due to colon cancer. It makes me sick that there is a cure, but families still have to watch their loved ones go through pain. Cancer is a huge money maker though, and I'm so fucking sick of it. I miss my little brother more than anything, he made this world brighter, he was such a genuine person and he didn't deserve it.   I really appreciate that you wrote this song. For the families, and the ones who are sick. Truly I am.  Rest in Paradise Jordan, I'll see you again one day.
Honestly Tom I hope it would be me out of the room put my sons and wife in the room...ill take that all day with a smile as long as i know they wont have too
God Bless you, Tom🥰
My best friend just died from it and this is cheering me up
Cured in the 40's. Look up Gerson....
oooph
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!!!!
I just found Tom.. this guy is amazing
My brother is dying from cancer and this song hits home. I think about him and what he's going through everyday when I hear it. Thanks Tom  for be so supportive in your songs not just this one but all of them. You and Nova are the best.
I’m an oncologist so I just came here because I don’t have enough hate in my life. It’s TRUE that many people get cancer and even with treatment, don’t survive. But the ones who do are walking miracles. We don’t do it for the money. We do it for the survivors. 28 years & counting. Love you Jeff❤️
Long telomeres increases general lifespan, but in doing so, increases likelihood of dying from cancer. Ultimately, we could hope to find a balanced approach to lengthening telomeres, while not pushing the envelope hard enough to cellularly hyperfocus on shortening 'over-elongated' telomeres. A delicate balance that could backfire via degradation of the global DNA pool, in short, more virulent forms of cancer with probabilities of earlier occurence. ~ Random Anon NPC Keyboard Warrior Bullcrud Creator/Not Authoritative
I just found out yesterday July 20th on my 16 yr old daughters birthday of all days 😭 I have polycythemia Vera blood cancer I'm 40 and scared out of my wits!

Song hits home lost my father 3 years ago to lung cancer.
They made the cure they just don't want to lose billions from curing people when they can make billions doing treatments and billing them every step
I started hearing him 1 hour ago. He made me laugh, he made me sad, he made me think.

Man, this stuff is Awesome 🙏💪
This song hits home. My now three year old was diagnosed one month after her second birthday on March 27,2020 in the middle of a pandemic. It took a year and a half of fighting and getting thrown out of doctors offices. They all called me crazy. Until one doctor noticed her spleen was triple the size is supposed to be and if she had fell she would have bursted it. Once every humanly possible test came back negative they agreed to genetic testing. Revealing a one in a million genetic mutation she was born with that causes jmml cancer. For an entire year I had cancer specialist look me in the eyes and say nothings wrong with her. If I hadn’t of kept fighting my daughter would not be here, jmml kills small children fast.
Bring on the water spigot 😭.  Interesting how I find this posted 9months after my mom passed away 9years ago from cancer.  Beautiful song Tom, Thank You❣️
One song I am dancing around, the next song has me laughing, the next song has me crying. Never stop Tom and Nova.
"Nothing matters if you don't have your health. All the money in the world doesn't help." I wish I didn't understand this line, but as my health has rapidly gotten worse over the last 5 years I've been forced to learn it first hand. Thank you
Lost my mom when she was 50 to cancer at 46 I had my fight still cancer free hope I stay that why but I live for the min the second not the day but for every moment ty for this song
This made me tear up. Got a inlaw aunt that's now fighting stage 4 lung cancer not including my tumor I have plus my aunts friend died from cancer. I hope others can find strength in this song as well as inspiration. Not my genre but I admire you Mr Mcdonald plus I'm becoming a fan
I sent this to my uncle with a stage 4 cancer. I hope I made the right decision 🙏
Thank you, Tom, for this. My mother lost her fight with pancreatic cancer 4 months ago and I miss her every single day.
I gave up 10 years ago that there would be a rapper from my age group, “32” that would be real and smart. Now I must find something else to give up on, it’ll be cigarettes and soda.
The "research" money dissappears when they find a cure.  Never will they want all that "research" money to stop coming in even if it means destroying familys and lifes. Big pharma would never allow it. ☹️
True that. Mom.
We lost my boys dad last yr due to bone marrow cancer. My mom has fought colon cancer for 7 yrs. My friend survived breast cancer and now is fighting bone marrow cancer. Our government is totally at fault. This song brings me to tears
This song hit home. I lost my father when I was 10. My mother has it. Also my sister. It runs through my family like a river through the woods that nobody has ever heard. Your amazing and I feel the same way. Thank you.
Lost my hero and mentor back in 2009. Love you Uncle Joe.
I lost my dad, mom, and my sister to cancer so I guess I’m next.
This song is so beautiful....I'm without words....
You son of a gun! I’ve been fan girling on all your stuff for more than a year now and just stumbled across this. I’m a bawling mess right now. Fantastic song!
Hits home hard  i just beat ALL Leukemia from 2012 to 2021 been rough but im here  and thankyou for the tune  made my evening!!
🔥🔥💋😻
😭😭😭😭😭
I cried through this one
Been a Tom Macdonald fan for a while and just found this song. Wow, my 6 year old son stop chemo treatments last year for leukemia, he also beat the worst case of mucormyosis the hospital has seen, 14 operations. This song hit so freaking hard. Much love.
I just heard this beautiful song for the first time... I listened to it 4x's in a row, crying. ... I lost the greatest person I have ever known to cancer...  My mama...   This is what I've found... Cancer takes the ones who loved this person...  & a part of them, dies when they do...  I believe "home" isn't really a place but a person... & when they are no longer... The days...  months...  & years... Become the miles between your heart & theirs... ... 5 years... God I miss her.  "... Her death wasn't the hardest thing I have ever gone through....  It's learning to live the rest of my life... without her in it...." That's the real trauma... The bond that was so strong... becomes the thing that in prisons you... a heart knows no limit... time isnt linear. ... the wound never truly heals...  It can't.  Thank you Tom... This has touched many 💟
I wish my dad was still around so he could have heard this. This video got me. Damn.  Just, really good job.
😎🤘❣💋YEP!!! 😭🥺
I was on the fence, but this song did it. Top 5 rappers. Wish I could like your hooks though.
This brought tears to my eyes because it's so true
She hit me so hard to start lose control of myself while I'm driving down the road man my mama just got just honest she had breast cancer not even 2 months ago she just started therapy
Battling 3rd stage of oral cancer. Suicide on the mind. And this song saved my heart. I pray to those who can fight this. Bless the family's. Soon we will all be together in the heavens above. 5 months left to live and everyday i listen to this at least 10 time's. It makes me feel alive. Ill never forget the family and loved one's.     To every single human being reading this, young or old, cancer or not, ethnicity not of any importance at all. I want you to know you are so fucking beautiful.
I've been in remission for 2 years but I just lost my mother a week ago to bone cancer. I still have my faith. 🖤
Damn Tom, just found you an hour ago from a reactor, and here i am, youre the man.
HIGH CARBOHYDRATE DIETS. SUGAR IS KILLING YOU. FOOD WITH BAR CODES IS POISON.
u are so right on dude. Kudos 2 u
"You don't know what you can take till you realize you didn't break". Damn Tom, that is such a powerful line.  I battled cancer in my 40's and my children were still young. I did my best to shield them from most of it. I had just divorced from a 20 year marriage and cancer came along. It broke me financially and almost emotionally. It was a hell of a fight.
The food we eat is killing us.
How in living helll can 3.4k DISLIKE this? What the hell is wrong with you?
I just found this song, got teary eyed from it. This song hit me hard. My son at 3 years old got childhood cancer. Went though a year of chemo. It was a hard time for myself and my family.....he’s a happy 6 year old now but I will always be scarred from that time in my life. Teary eyed as I type this now. Thank you Tom
Much love (*JET).... (*CSK)
We’re all gonna die one day. Fight like fuckin hell till you get there.
CLVS
I give love to everyone that's been there
I cried my eyes out watching this video!!!
Hey, Tom ... cool piece ... wish I had it when I was going though radiation for my prostate cancer - I think the nurses would have really gotten into it!  I went through standard radiation, the new-tech super-fancy radiation, but the tumor just laughed it off.  I'm currently on a bunch of drugs (the same sort that the trans gals take, unfortunately) to starve it of it's "food", testosterone, and I'm just glad that this waited until my 60's to hit me, because ... well, it would have been a real rough deal had I needed to go here when I was younger. Have you considered offering it (licensing it, or whatever) to a cancer group like Imerman Angels (https://imermanangels.org) ... I'm just spitballing here, but it struck me that this would be real helpful if more people doing battle with cancer got introduced to it.
I'm in England, so speading money on treatment doesn't matter here. But my mother had a gallbladder that was causing her a lot of pain that she was talking about quite a bit, asking to get it checked. Eventually it got removed and sent to America to be checked because it was just so big. Well, her worst fears were right and she wasn't well enough to eveb do chemo... Last thing I thought when shaving my hair off for a style change I'd have to witness it first hand 3 months later.  Awesome song Tom, like always!
😥, lost my father....bone cancer...now my dad(step father)...6yrs stage 4 lung cancer(were blessed he is still with us)....im not waiting to die,  I'm waiting for cancer.........
Wow
Man you are someone who cannot stop in what you doing and can’t let the haters to tell you that you are not good enough. I don’t usually comment on anything like that but this song and many others is with so deep meaning and the truth behind every word you say it’s amazing. Well done don’t stop.✊✊✊
been adding all your music on my mp3 and heard you for the first time last night, amazing songs!! keep it up, i will keep liking and adding your music, finally some real rap music about life   thanks tom
Yes they do have a cure and they keep from most of us. Lost many from the selfishness.
"You won't know why you have faith till you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take till you realize you didn't break"
They had a cancer cure in the 60's! They have drove doctors who were curing cancer bankrupt and DEA has stolen research from these same Doctors. Look up the rife machine history and what they did to the man who invented the machine.
GOD BLESS YOU TOM AND NOVA!
I started dating my girlfriend after she got a section of her colon removed because of neuroendocrine cancer. I have seen her so weak and I’ve seen her so strong. Please pray for her as the doctor thinks she may have carcinoid heart disease. When you hear someone you love tell you she doesn’t want to die by 23 you can’t keep yourself from crying.
💸💸💸
to all those cancer survivors keep fighting your doing great
My mom just passed from cancer this morning..... :(
♥️♥️♥️
"Everybody knows someone who's sick" love this song! CANCER SUCKS 🖤☠💯
Thank you Tom.
Touching.
This is a amazing song Tom..  Tomorrow July 10,2021 marks 2 yrs my grandmother died in my arms from cancer..  My wifes mother died of cancer..  A great song... Hits home.
People have no idea but I do believe they Really don't want to prevent cancer. Too much money in it. They just don't spend enough in this research. Targeted and immunotherapy is making an impact but why it took so long? We should've been here a long time ago.
Hey man thanks for making this song my mom heard it and it made her cry shes been fighting cancer for 4 years and has been put on home hospice but this song became her favorite when she heard it and she still asks to hear it
Beautiful track bro
Your depth is always breathtaking,
Love you man but why is the girl in the video sick in the first place?
even tom haters gotta have some respect for this one
I got to admit I'm a guy that never like anything to do with rap music thought it was all s*** but now after listening to this guy's stuff and his girlfriend stuff it's not the rap music I didn't like it's just the s*** they singing about I didn't relate to any of it this guy in his girl there stuff that shit's real I love this man's music I love his girls music I love the way she makes the videos this is true talent and they need their props
These are beautiful words Tom. Keep on fighting and writing brotha.
my mom is going through her second bout with cancer
Cancer survivor here, this brought tears to my eyes.
did you just diss cancwr
I don't get why this hasn't had more views in the 8 months it's existed. It's an amazing anthem  EVERYONE NEEDS TO HEAR THIS
Exactly!!!Its a money making disease. The system is the disease. Jesus is real and He is preparing a place for those that know Him. There is a heaven and a hell. We choose!
Thank you for this song I've loss a few family members to cancer , this song brought me to tears...
Thanks for this song i had 4 stage Cancer and I am going on ten years out and doing great so thankful 😊
I just wasn't ready for this song.
My sister fought 10 long years with cancer unfortunately I lost her 6 years ago I miss her everyday
President buy guns but don't give money to stop. Cancer Facts
My dad had cancer when I was just 3 and I am 11 now and he had stage 4 and 3 and he had it twice and I am so happy that he is still with me
I just got diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma, fancy words for breast cancer.  I'm only 36, I'm extremely scared and overwhelmed.  I cant tell you how many times I listen to this song a day ❤❤it is going to help me kick cancer's ass !!
How can anybody dislike this video makes me sick
R.I.P. MOM 2015 Fk U Cancer!
I survived brain cancer at 2 1/2 years old. Don't give up if u have cancer. If u have beat it good for u, u are a soldier in ur own way.
One of the greatest songs I have ever heard!
My Dad's fighting something really aggressive and I've been there for him every step, but it's so hard, you have to be sooo damn strong. You have to drop a big chunk of your ego and just take care of your family. Thanks Tom!
My Mikey lost his battle. I’m still so angry cause his doctors told me he failed their protocol and I told them NO, your protocol failed Mikey. Mikey was a super kid a genius who couldn’t , in his words; grow up to be a man with strong muscles and a mustache. HOG would be Mikey’ s hero :(
Both my parents have stage 4 right now. I’m blessed with good enough health to do everything I can for them. Keep up fam.
WoW just Wow Such beauty in this WoW Much Love From OhiO Namaste 🙏🏼🍄🙏🏿🌹✊🏼✊🏿💪🏼💪🏿 We Are All Just Walking Eachother Home
Thank you Tom and Nova this its home many times to many !! love yall for for what yall do for us !! #HOG !!
I believe that cancer is used by the interest of those who profit from human misery.  Once the real "woke" see this and act on the tyranny of big pharma and the medical mafia, then we can then heal, the natural way and the way that nature intended.
I Lost 1 high school lover of mine to cancer and 2 othes due to drug over dose, I had to go identify them. Depression pills don't work when you fight the memories!
I’m a mental head , but this is brilliant 🙏🤝👍✌️
WOW
My son had leukemia as a baby/toddler.  3 1/2 years of watching your child go through chemo is draining emotionally and financially.  I showed Zach this video and he, who is now 13, got the feels like crazy.  Thanks for this!
You know you've hit a nerve with this song when you can bring tears to a grown man's eyes. Thank you.
July 8 will be a year since I lost my mom to lung cancer. We had 9 months from diagnosis to her death, I watched the strongest woman I’ve ever known turn in to a weak, frail shell of the person I knew from the chemo, radiation & immunotherapy. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. She fought till she couldn’t anymore. 😢😢 thank you
I absolutely believe they have a cute for cancer .
Right on point........
Every human being is born with cancer and every human being has a different trigger to trigger it and they know how to fix it and they're not going to do it they're going to invent even more ways to trigger it
To Tom and Nova  your songs have meaning every single one this one definitely hits home ibjust found out i have stage 3 liver crazy im fighting the cancer and not knowing the outcome and I always thought I was a fighter before but now I realize I pray everyday that ther is something after this 🙏 this song changes everything and I thank you so much guys Hang Over Gang for life 💯
But it only took a few months for some wierd covid cures to pop up.  And cancer is a damn bitch. I pray you all stay healthy-
An absolutely beautiful song, one of the few songs that brings a tear to my eye.
My dad has cancer 😞 stay positive yeah
All these dislikes from evil people
u r so much better than Slim
@tommcdonald #tommcdonald your amazing brother! I'd love some help on my lyrics and beat from you and #NOVA
Nobody wants to die!!! But in Burma💔
The chorus to this song always makes me cry, in a good way. ♥ It's so touching.
Thanks for this ✌😎
how is there 3.4 dislikes what sickos dislike this? look I get that they may not like tom, but you think this would be the expectation? like fuck cancer man.
I lost a close friend to cancer. This song speaks volumes to me
Wish I could show this to my late mother, she would really have appreciated it. Thanks, partner. Her sudden passing took something I'll never get back.
Truth!! I'm 16 years post dx with leukemia and still fighting. It's tried to kill me twice, but I'm too stubborn to die. I feel it's hardest on the partners that have to stand by, but feel helpless. You help just by being there. Loving your work TM
It's pharmaceutical companies don't have any incentive and finding the cure for any disease. They just want to create treatments so that they can extend your lies and just make you keep taking whatever medication that'll just treat your disease not. So that you can be there repeat customers because where else are you going to go? I mean you had that one pharmaceutical CEO who created this drug. Cost I think normally it would have cost a couple bucks but because increase the price to a couple hundred dollars. This is the same CEO who fought down one coffee of the Wu-Tang Clan CD. The one and only copy of that CD
My dad died of cancer of the throat this was in 2011. It devastated me and my brother back in 2017, I was in the hospital for hip replacement surgery.. my surgery and went well. I did have to stay in the hospital for post-op care and just to make sure I'm okay. And also fart antibiotic treatment then one day a doctor came in to my room. He said he needed to basically get an x-ray of my chest because they couldn't see in the area behind my heart and above my stomach. When the doctor left the room, I freaked out and started to cry. Because this was the same area where my dad's cancer was. Luckily everything was normal what's this song I do wonder what the hell is going on with the cancer treatment technology and funding. I wouldn't be too surprised that if there was treatment for cancer other than radiation and chemotherapy. You can bet cancer treatment is just breaking and a ton of money for the hospitals in the pharmaceutical industry because one thing that this pandemic showed was how corrupt the pharmaceutical industry can be. I mean there was covid-19 treatment out there that's been out there for decades. I mean it's originally used for malaria patients. Since this medication has been out there for decades it cost the truly pennies per treatment right now. I mean in countries where there is a ton of malaria, this drug is sold over-the-counter. Now if you mentioned it, YouTube will cancel you. They've canceled plenty of other YouTube channels just by mentioning it I mean it doesn't matter if you're just a Plano YouTuber or a actual doctor especially a doctor who treated covid-19 patient with this I mean I find it funny that one Trump 1 Trump reduce the price of insulin to 50% then the next thing you know these pharmaceutical companies announce the vaccine for covid-19 after the election. I don't think that's a coincidence because the next thing you know when binding gets into office he cancelled Trump's executive order for the price of insulin so something that would have cost me $150 under tongue now costs $300 under minded.
I cry now
even if your not a fan of Thomas to give this a thumbs down you'd have to be a real piece of shit
Fighting cancer myself isn't easy but we got this!!
Thank you for doing this one, personally it speaks to me. I faced one and I'm still here.
Today marks the five year anniversary of my mom's stage four colon cancer going into remission, she is OFFICIALLY CURED!   I will be praying for those that are not as fortunate. KEEP FIGHTING. Even though you may have moments where you don't think you are strong enough to fight, please...PLEASE...know that you are!!!
I really enjoy this music video
This is very sad that it happens but it is the truth
Thanks you for this. I lost my brother 2 years ago. I lived in the hospital with him for a month. I had to watch his fear as he passed.
There are a few doctors who have found cures. But they seem to just disappear.
This not just a song.Its an anthem.
Thank you my father beat his cancer last year one year in remission in the books as of February.
That song got me, there’s a little boy in my neighborhood who just came home from hospice because his wish was to be able to rest in his own bed. So unfair- Thank u like always Tom for speaking the truth
Best friend just got diagnosed with stage IV stomach cancer a month and half ago.   This hits hard.
its nice to hear some hip hop that holds real meaning.  Not just talking of pimpin hoes and slamming cadalliac doors.  Love him.  right there with immortal technique
My dog has cancer I have to put her down next fri even tho she isn’t human she’s still my family this song kills me but I have to hear it
Dang... you just keep astounding me with your very wonderful topics. Keep throwing the truth at them. You don't know how important you are with these messages.
I watched my dad in agony for 6 months straight. He had pancreatic cancer. Watching a loved one die is traumatic. I know these hospitals could save a lot of people but every fucking thing revolves around money in this shitty world. To all who have lost someone I share you're pain.
I beat it and it was no sweat (chemo and puking, hair loss, wanting to die, but I am old, so fight and accept). My wife recently had a scare and I was jelly. I know what it takes to fight it and I accept that. Survivors are badasses, but I don't consider myself one for some reason. Probably because it was a tough, hard fight, but it was over quick and (so far) I won. Long term fighters deserve respect and if I can ever help, let me know. When my wife got the news I was destroyed. Thank God the doc was inept. Thanks for this, Tom. You are  badass and a fighter for us!
Thanks Tom from us that are walking that road. Bend Or
Thank you my mom  just passed from cancer today
That made me cry.had cancer saw the devil and bet it.man crazy when you go through it and see all the people who don't make it and wonder why we still have CANCER IN THIS WORLD 💔😪
❤️
💯
This one hits hard for me, my stepmother fought cancer and passed away on the 25th of July last year, keep doing what you're doing man, no matter what
Yes, we all know someone who had cancer... My father died of lung cancer that spread throughout his body. My mother had breast cancer (beat it) but ended up dying of ovarian cancer. My brother died of rectal cancer. In two words... Cancer Sux!
I'm a cancer survivor even remission still have side effects. My determination to love and stayed positive I did for my son!
I just found this song just now and weirdly my family was so blessed and lucky because my mom was diagnosed with stage 2 melanoma cancer last month and she got the all clear this month in june.
Thank you, for addressing pharmaceutical corruption and greed!
my dad died yes agree there is  a cure
There’s nothing harder than hearing your sister tell you she’s afraid. 😢
🙋🏻‍♂️Hello from  Colorado USA
Yeah, Cancer sucks. Had 2 tumors cut out already. This song hits deep...
3.4K Thumb Down ....... Really ... WTF
This song really brought tears to my eyes I'm fighting stage 4 cancer rn and was told I have a 50% chance to live past 30 months
7 1/2 yr lung cancer survivor here.  Dude, I cried.  When I was diagnosed--you would be surprised how many of my "friends" disappeared--just when I needed friends most!  NEVER EVER abandon us--we need you!  My Daddy died of the same lung cancer I was diagnosed with.  I am also a nurse.  The more my Daddy needed me to be a nurse, the more the little girl in me came out because I kew my Daddy was dying and I couldn't help.  I consider myself a chemotherapy survivor...first treatment almost killed me--don't remember the 1st 3 days in the hospital.  Never listen to the time table they give you.  They gave me 5 yrs, I beat those odds so far. The chemo and other treatments are outrageous.  My hubby and I had to file for bankruptcy--now, it's all I can do to keep my home and get food! The part when mom climbs in bed with the daughter killed me.  When my Daddy was dying, I curled up behind him and held him til he breathed his last breath,
3 thousand 400 LOSERS don't like this song. Wild.
I cured my Colon Cancer using CANNABIS! It is part of the reason I am shadow banned.
My mom and I are cancer survivors but sadly lost a grandfather to cancer
Can’t get anymore real... No fast vaccine for this???
I wish there was a lot more people like Tom, may god bless you Tom
Profit in relief not the cure. "Never waste a crisis."
I will never understand why we allow ourselves to be treated by a system that fears us in to believing chemo and radiation (that is a carcinogen) is a viable option. We must educate ourselves and not be feared into making a rushed decision. I’d rather live with Cancer and have a quality of life in the end then be strapped to machines filling me with poison until the very end. There are options people and Cancer is man made. It doesn’t have to be a death sentence if you stay away from the traditional treatments of slice and burn.
WOW!
Who ever dis liked this has no heart nor do they want to see reality. Nick nothem
I was diagnosed in January with neuroendocrine cancer of the pancreas. I am told i am lucky as i have the slowest rate of growth there is and i may not have to worry about it for a long time. But it was and still is the scariest thing i have ever been though. I found Tom only a few days ago, never liked rap other than stuff from the 80s, but Tom, You sir, have changed that. Every song i hear from you resonates and Here i sit crying my eyes out because of someone like you who actually cares for people you dont even know. Please keep up the work and know that you truly have an army of people behind you that also care about you and what you do for this world and its people.
Plz prayers for my friend has 3rd stage lung cabcer
My dad died of cancer less than 2 years ago. I held him in my arms as he took his last breath. I love this song. I hate this song.
I found you and love you and nova! I had cancer 10yrs ago and beat it naturally and this video with so many of them spoke to me.  Going to tell you what I hear to this day....keep fighting..you are a warrior and loved!
Cancer is Horrible!
ben beat cancer tom
Oh man now this is deep love it thank you ☺️ never give up never surrender 😉
I’ve been battling an autoimmune flare for three years and it almost took my life just a year after my daughter was born. This song makes me cry every time.   I’ve fought long and hard, but there are days when I don’t feel like a fighter. Those days when I’m so weak or I hurt so much that I just want to rest and have Jesus take me home. Your song helps remind me that I need to be a fighter, even when the fight seems pointless. God has brought me back from a truly hopeless place. If you’re sick, don’t give up. You have more fight in you than you realize.
Chispa been kicking butt. About time someone speak the truth...
Incredible song I can relate to. Thank you for sharing!
Bro who THE FUCK can dislike this song?
Truth
I watch your music all the time, every release and I still didn’t see this song…. Wow, say it brother amazing
This is beautiful.
Tears, my dad made it a year and a couple of months when given 2 months. Transitional Cell Carcinoma.
Unfortunately I lost my Mum to Breast Cancer. You have just hit everyone of my heart strings with this song. Than You!!
3.4k people are the cancer
WHO HURT THIS MAN?!?!? YOU DEMON!!!
its hard to listen to this song ive had two family members pass from cancer and another family member who beat it but it wore his heart out and still passed away, all in a very short time 1999,2002,2004 and i was a paul bearer at two of the funerals one of the hardest things ive ever had to do.
TRUTH !!!!!!!!!!!
Made me cry.
My baby boy had cancer got it when he was 3 and passed away before he turned 8 . Cancer is the hardest thing to see someone so young to go throw . Almost been ten years and not a second of the day that little guy not in my head . We share the same bday which makes it harder
Amen
A true warrior is someone who is fighting Cancer Head on
Took my mom june 15th:( 2021 😭😭
Tom I know you might not see this. Your music is truly helping me thru the darkness in my life currently. Thank you sir. I'd like to speak to you one day
Thank you, Tom
Just found this song.  Not gonna lie, it brings tears every time I listen.  Cancer has taken my grandfather,  father, father-in-law, aunt and an uncle.  Also 3 other family members had and beat cancer.  Thanks Tom for pointing out how "treatment " is about the money.
I'm taking care of my mom with stage IV Lung cancer. Money means nothing without our health. Thank you Tom for talking about this. It's painful to live not knowing what happens to this cancer with each scan. Prayers for all of us who is suffering with Cancer.
God help us
When I was around 6 years old my Grandpa developed cancer, blessed by the lord he survived, but just before he was considered ’treated’(I think that’s 5 years cancer free), he developed the same cancer once again, miraculously he made it through that again, and his real issue was severe dementia and severe copd, a couple years ago they found a small spot of cancer but not enough to worry about, around January his health and deteriorated, and it was a see him as much as possible kind of thing, the hospital visit he never came home from they found he had been eaten alive by cancer, not just the original lung cancer(what he had twice)
Sob... What a beautiful song.  Thank you for writing this.
Stellar.
Lost my wife 10 years ago she was a fighter. I now volunteer for pediatric brain cancer foundation. We got to keep fighting.  Thank you Mr Macdonald
And to hell with you 3.4 thousand that didn't like his song. You must not have someone in your life who is somewhere you can't help them get out from. I dislike your disliking the message in the song but I am happy you don't understand the meaning of it an hope you never have to
My mum has stage four invasive breast cancer.. She has been in remission for three years after only bein given a year to live. She stopped chemo and went the holistic route. Her insurance dropped her and sued her for the expenses they covered while she went through radiation therapy. Yet, she is doin better now, and grown her hair back. Since she stopped chemo. I don't know enough about chemo or it all but I've learned enough about insurance and it's politics to know so much of it is f'd up. I appreciate this song.
Funny how we got a fake vaccine in less than year?
Rest In Peace Angel Ramos 👼He was 3 years old. 😢
lost 4 members of my family in the last 8 years to cancer and your totally right there is a cure. Medbeds have been made for decades but still unauthorised for use. You are the most genuine artist ive ever heard Tom genuinely speak pure truth. The worlds a disgusting place and will be fixed by people like me and you who still have fight in our bellies and the brains to see through the matrix
Dam.....FUCK CANCER. LOST TOO MANY GOOD PEOPLE  TO THAT MONSTER. Thanks Tom.
Thank you so much for this
Advanced stage 3 NHL as of now in Remission! Never heard of ya tom but thanks for the song !!!
My fight song
Ik u will never see this tom but I'm a huge fan I wish u and nova the best
You need to run for president you have my vote
Song so true donations go for testing so rich people can be save in the end  . Plus greed destroys every nation.
I have no idea how I've managed to miss this song until now but thank you.  I've had cancer and now riddled with problems from the radiation. This song hit me so hard.  I'm 42 with a 4 year old son and I pray I live long enough to see him grow up and at the very least live long enough for him to have some solid memories of me.  Thank you so much for this song.  ❤
4 of my family members have cancer and one of them only has a week or 2 to 4 days to live he has brain cancer plus his liver hips and colon are covered
Thank you for this song. My dad passed in 2018 from pancreatic cancer. My mother in law is a breast cancer survivor 12 years.
Thank you Tom! As a cancer survivor  I thank you
First time listening to this........I don't know why. ITS BEAUTIFUL 💕
Has anyone else noticed that as soon as you start taking one medication you are taking 15?  The other 14 are for side effects in an unending rabbit hole. Also notice that they try to keep us alive forever and then push euthanasia instead of giving pain control and letting people die at home surrounded by loved ones?
My ant has Cancer and she has 1 moth left we love you Jennifer
Fucking cancer, already lost 2 family members to it and now my mother has it. It will probably be the way i go aswell, it's nightmarish.
Tom is a Blessing in a world that needs more. God Bless.
Tom thanks for song and Whiteboy especially  , watched my Dad die of cancer aged 42 36yrs ago  , it has affected me my whole life loosing him  at a young age, I'm now 15yrs older than he was , id have thought cancer would have been cured by now , although cures are getting better , Nixon injected billions in todays terms in the 70s to find a cure for cancer , I live in hope that one day soon the total cure will be found , especially for the children going through it , I'm not into rap but your music and lyrics are just fantastic and speak for so many ordinary people who don't have a voice, using your ability for words and speech is the greatest thing, with respect,  thank you and well done .
2.7 million?  F you America! Should be billion views
WOW. Always nothing  but the best from Tom. You can always see his passion. I'm curious who Logan Fulton is. Why they needed him to help with the video and all. What bits he did and stuff. Also recognise the doctor from White Boy.
Currently undergoing chemotherapy.  I'm a negative 3 stage 3 and no one can understand the journey unless they go through it themselves but Tom you nailed it. Thank you and bless you for  the truths you unveil with each song. Everyone has a gift , some know how to use while others dont and you have that gift. 💖
I lost my grandfather to stage 4 prostate cancer. He was the strongest, sweetest man. He never met a stranger and I miss him dearly. He was a life long mechanic and he is the reason I am where I am today. I use his tools everyday to provide for my family, just as he did. For those who have it, fight like there’s no tomorrow and for those who know someone who has it, treat every second like it’s their last.
We give anything For just another second
Tom, my dad died of brain cancer. A block wall died bone skinny. It was ugly. Thank you for your massive heart and God bless.
A week and a day ago, I lost one of my closest friends to cancer. She was like a mom to me for 10+ years.
This song hits home, as my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer a couple of months ago. Thank you! ❤️
Wow Tom and Nova this is a powerful song and video. Good job!
Everytime I hear this song it reminds me of my Mother When cancer attacks you find out what you're made of. All your life you thought you knew pain, hurt and loss you were kidding yourself  You count how many times you begged to take their place Knowing that soon you won't be seeing their face That moment is when the cancer finally releases You're left there with your heart picking up all it's pieces Now burned in your mind the memory of that day Prepare yourself for the truth THAT HURT NEVER GOES AWAY
When my son was in hospital having chemo. I asked a surgeon if it was true that vitamin C from the health shops was it true that they have experimented pumping a cancer patient with it and these granules U take at night to absorb all the toxens in your body. She looked me straight in the face and said ,it's only worked on animals. That's bullshit. The government looses too much money. So caught U out.
the pain and swelling  is very bad  this song helps that God
My grandma died to cancer
Really great one Tom ! ♥️♥️
Amazing song .... Damn this hits me hard
My son died from cancer. Fuk cancer !!!
I just saw my best friend to metastatic breast cancer Her funeral is in a  week...this song makes my heart Happy thinking of her and all the good times
FOR this song Tom I LOVE YOU Thank you for giving us the music we so desperately need.   You TOM MACDONALD are  a GOAT ANGEL.  Thank you for Tom & Nova God
squamous cell carcinoma survivor. Head a neck. Thank you for this song Tom. Keep up the good work. Money buys poor people freedom, but it only buys the wealthy power.
Lost my mom 3 mouths ago died after one treatment of chemo. Thank You
OMG wtf damn
It is sad to say but there is a cure for cancer. If they would give us the cure they wouldn't make any money sad but true. All I can say is fight till the end. I have seen it so many times of people dieing from cancer and close to home. I pray for all those have it and has fought it god bless u all
The truth is the Negative Alien Agenda
90 billion donated to cure cancer, holly crap ill take some donations to tell you I've made no progress LOL the poor really do fund the rich.
👍
I just got on to tom last week ,i cant believe one guy has such talent,Iam so jelous
I'm beginning to think that I'm ready to go. This world has become such an awful place. Hopefully i go to heaven, but if not, i already know what hell is like.
Hey Tom it's your friend Michael from Alabama I've seen your cancer video before but I'm really watching it now for the first time fully through all the way because I lost my mother do to cancer and it's because she caught cancer due to slip and fall in a dairy Queen and they basically dairy Queen got away with murdering my mother because they only ended up paying me and my brother four grand two grand a piece and I would give it back in a heartbeat for my mother but they've killed her and got away with it and didn't even have to pay they paid her doctors her lawyers and then gave us two grand a piece and thought that was enough for what they took from us I don't know how much strength is taking for me to not just destroy their business but I don't destroy their business for the memory of my mother for my brother and for my soon-to-be wife is the only reason I don't go after dairy Queen and destroy their world because I got too much to lose now but you really touch me with the song and I have signed up to buy stuff from your website hangover game and I've already signed up to receive emails from your girl Nova on her website and I'm subscribed to both of y'all and maybe one day maybe I'll get lucky enough to meet you all it wouldn't surprise me I've met a lot of famous people I've met evander holyfield I've met Chris tuck walk scared Chris Tucker I didn't really meet him I've scared him got into an argument with Dakota fanning cuz she lied to my mother about me I've met Ole Anderson the wrestler my brother's met Ludacris and accidentally made fun of him to his face his bouncers didn't think it was too funny but it was an accidental making fun of him cuz he didn't know who it was but I met a lot of famous people but there's very few I actually wanted to meet really badly few of them are dead now so I'll never get to meet him like DMX and a few other famous people then I've lost a lot of respect for a lot of famous people but surprisingly enough I gained a lot of respect for one famous person that I watched from charmed cuz she's a lot like you now Rose McGowan she is a lot like you she wants to fight for Americans and help people who need help so maybe one day I'll maybe get to meet you and Nova and maybe even get to meet Rose and a few other people and then there's a few stories I can't tell on here about a certain Big Time rapper probably don't even remember me anymore but I ran into him I had a special party for a special group that I'm not going to say on here but let me just say their colors are blue and white and I'll leave it at that and again like I said I'll be awesome for me and my fiance / soon-to-be wife to meet you in Nova cuz we're big fans of y'all's so thanks for the videos and for standing up for real Americans and you got me and my brother and my girl and a few others I know back in y'all so remember y'all never be alone you got fans that got your backs. Thick and thin
Thank you for this song. I fought stage 3 breast cancer and found out I was a warrior! Four years later, I’m still here for my family!
i lost family to cancer, this song ius absolutely amazing love you tom
all I wat to say is: This Man is a Legend....
I lost both my parents to cancer. Thank you sir
this young man is something special i wonder if he understands how many lifes he will change
If you’re getting treated, research into fasting before chemo. It might help depending on the type of cancer and type of treatment to protect healthy cells and sensitize cancerous ones (stress differential). Look into fasting and cancer in general, including prevention.
A patient cured is a customer lost. Don't be fooled
Oh Tom.  (speechless)
Sunshine Biopharma take a look because it's going into trials as we speak it's 16x more effective than chemo and doesn't poison you.
My daughter is in remission ..This song is fucking great..
As a childhood cancer survivor this song just hit me hard thanks for writing this it was very cathartic for me.
2x cancer survivor here and a big scan tomorrow to see if declining chemo and going integrative was the true way to go for me. I believe it was. But I’m a mess. I’m a huge fan of yours and just found this. From the bottom of my heart, thank you Tom.
This song mean so much to me, i was just told that i have small cell cancer with only 25% survival, i know God is standing with me Amen
This is what rap should be. Pick a subject that people can relate to, use your skill to make people think a little more than they otherwise would have. Be a conduit for change, you know Like Tom MacDonald is.
💯on point!
What a beautiful song. My mom died of breast cancer in 1983. They told her she was too young to get it, misdiagnosed and she went through radiation, chemo, mastectomy. I miss my mom…
this song hits home you keep knocking me of my feet
This song reminds me of my sister in law that we lost almost 3 years ago she was a teacher and loved everyone. You would never know she had cancer she was always happy and fought so hard till the very end. I see her beautiful soul shine through her three small daughters every day.
Thanks for this song it brought me to tears as I thought about the ones I have lost to cancer.
This song hit hard for me, my daughter is fighting now. Love you Tom.
I watched my cousin slowly die of cancer when she 11.. This song touched my her.. Mad respect sir Tom.
I would play this song for my aunt on her really bad days. She lost her battle yesterday. She's not suffering anymore.
Thank you. 2018 three different breast cancer. I agreed to have both breast removed! Nothing else. Living like I don’t know what cancer is. Unfortunately I didn’t know about flat closures. So there is some weird skin junk left but I’m saying no cancer😃 Great song.
Kemo is nothing more than money and false hope. The money mankind has thrown at cancer we should have a cure. Money is created through relief, welcome big pharma. Luckily the good go to heaven and I'll gladly be an asshole if it means ten live happily.
Cancer took my wife in 2014 for three years I’ve had cancer for a year and a half now it’s stage four and I’ve got a 10% chance It’s hard to just stay ahead of the curve on co-pays for treatments I think it’s all just one big businessman
The people who disliked it are his competition  :)   ... I am a non believer..  I don't put a tag on me that was thought up by religious nut jobs..(atheist)  The only IST I am is a REALIST.....  I simply just don't believe in some invisible guy in the sky..,  I believe in my fellow man and science.. those can be quantified ...  the other can't..   and I still love this song... it tugs on heart strings that ever one seems to have a tie to,  just some food for thought..  look up how many people per 100 got cancer before antibiotics ... till now...  then just think about this... look at the first flight in 1903, the Wright brothers.. till now  how far planes have come..   then look at cancer treatment in 1903 till now..   you will be shocked..  hasn't changed much at all.. just the fancy names..    If they found a cure for cancer today,  our economy would collapse over night,  just the pharma companies alone make , not millions.. not billions, they make TRILLIONS...  this is not even counting research grants, donations to hospitals, and so much more...   it's a business..   and very lucrative one at that,..  just one of the big pharma companies makes in 6 months more than the big 3 auto companies combined in a year....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 THE Z
Today my mom would have being 64 yrs old!!! She was so brave!!! Thank you for this song !!❤️🙏🏼
wow first video of yours that got me choked up; but your right, it's been bout half a century and they still haven't published a cure. Where as with the covid19 they made one within a year, that's not right 🥵
this song brings tears to my eyes, my daughter was diagnosed with cancer in 2020 at the age of 11   Keep up with the awesome songs Tom
My mom passed away from cancer last year. I miss her so much. I think about her 24/7. She was my best friend and my number 1 cheerleader. She was a author and a motivational speaker and a saint
There is a Cure, but you have to pay for it.. It's only for the Rich.. The more Cancer there is in the world the more $$$$$$$$ they make.
I lost My father and my beloved husband to the killer oncologist that follow the Big Pharma profits !  And now they have unleashed a virus with a vaccine that has killed 5888 vaccinated to date  !  I refuse to be a lab rat to their profit !
This is awesome!!!
This song is wonderfully GRAND!! As a 2x Cancer survivor and many other operations for organ failures, etc. It's lonely and scary. The meds they give to "kill" the cancer just in turn continues to poison you for the rest of your life. Thank you so much for this song. I've been a fan for a while now but felt I should leave my comment here. ❤️
Wow that all I got wow!
thank you, this one broke me!
I’ll echo someone else’s post, no artist like youever in my life, and I’m not young. May God guide and protect you.
Thank you Tom and Nova. I crawled onto the hospital bed with my wife and held her while she slept to comfort her. She was down to 85 pounds on her fourth round of chemo. Her beautiful hair was gone. Her eyelashes and eyebrows were gone. Her skin was orange and her lips were cracked. Both her breasts had been removed. I prayed to God to transfer the cancer to me to save her. She is a much better person and worth saving. I was helpless to save my wife. My whole universe was shrunk down to the two of us on the hospital bed. That was fifteen years ago. My wife survived  Never give up. Never stop fighting. Never stop praying.
WOW man!!!! You are bad ass!!!! I lost my daddy December 31, 2020. He beat cancer twice. Throat cancer. We never got to hear his actual voice again. He then survived 3 strokes. My parents both had covid. My sister, my oldest nephew and myself cared for them thru that shit and we were all rite there when he finally stopped fighting to remain here with  us. We were there when he took his last swing. Even in my daddy’s very weakened state when my parents  contracted the virus that the powers that be created, then set loose on us, he still survived  the actual virus. He just didn’t quit have the strength or the fight left in him to bounce back. He was a awesome man! He took two little red headed girls in and accepted us both as his own from day one when he met my moma. This little red headed girl never made it easy for him let me tell you!!! But he always loved me anyway.  I recently stumbled upon you and your music and I have been pretty captivated ever since. Every lyric I have heard so far is spot on. Honest to God truth is very rare these days!!! Most people lack the balls to call others out when they know they are spewing lies. So many pusses, pansy’s and buttercups breeding these days. Thank you for being the best rapper ever!!! Cancer❤️Sober❤️people so stupid❤️I don’t drink❤️!!! Every song I’ve heard so far is the shit! 100% Tom McDonald fan bb
you know when something hits home so hard u just sit back in your chair and say nothing for like 2 minutes... love this!
SOUR HONEY, FROM A REGION IN SOUTH AFRICA IS THE CURE FOR CANCER. CHECK OUT HEALTH SIENCE INSTITUTE.
My heart is sincerely with those who face this battle thanks for this tune tom it's a good one
I just found this guy, and first, how did it take so long, second I read the comments and see that alot, last, hes absolutely amazing.
If cancer was cured, pharmaceutical companies wouldn't make nearly as much.
Have endometrial cancer— going thru chemo—had thyroid cancer 20 yrs ago— belief in Jesus has made me calm and believe in Him only—believers all go to heaven— unbelievers dont that’s why they need our prayers and guidance— to be saved— I am here to share the gospel or good news of salvation— from one cancer survivor to all others
good song
Today. 6/12/21. 23 years ago my father died from cancer. 6/12/98. Thanks for this, song brightens a dark day in my life.
Dude you are a beast, thank you!!!
Lost my Dad to prostat cancer 6 years ago.  Tom, you just made me cry like a girl for the second time.
oh yeah...there is something after this......and it is free for those that simply ask.
Awesome song. Thank you
Right on Man, just got turned on to your music from Officer Tatums show . Love it TRUTH .
Man this shit brought tears to my eyes man...I needed this something serious..I'll be dedicating this to my mother, a 3 time cancer survivor! She's my angel!
What I love most about your music @TomMacDonald is it's relatable! My cancer started when I was 16 then 8 surgeries later, and still only given a 95% recovery rate. But I've beat the 5 year life expectancy doctors gave me by 30 years. Never stop your calling in life! You reach people in so many different ways! God speed! 🙏 🙌
He should do a live for cancer awareness
The problem is "everyone not wanting to die". It used to be natural but these days, everyone's so scared of it. And, I'll tell you all why. We're all scared of death because we're all busy wasting our lives chasing fake reality and thus we're not really alive and no one wants to die having never lived.   Best way to enjoy and appreciate life is to understand that one day, like it or not, no matter how much money we spend, WE ARE GOING TO DIE.  Well, I tell you one thing, I appreciate life and when it comes my time for cancer, whenever that is, I won't be spending shit loads of money trying to eek out a few more years. I'll be blowing all my cash on partying with my friends. I mean, it's not like I'm gonna' need the money when I die.   Also, Big Pharma is only big pharma because everyone keeps giving them money in the vain hope of an immortal life.
My aunt died of cancer last year, my uncle(her husband) is constantly fighting. Next time he gets it he won't be able to fight it.
My wife had breast cancer two years ago, we beat that with chemo and long term medications, many late night trips to hospital. Three weeks ago my brother-in-law collapsed and we find out he has an aggressive terminal stage IV cancer. He thought his "collapse" was from work stress and fatigue...which turned into organizing and planning his funeral which will be before Christmas. This was after him finally realizing what the oncologists meant by "we'll do chemo until it doesn't work", it hit hard when he understood what that implied.  His family has had it tough, parents in their late 80's and early 90's. Mother had a heart attack last year at Christmas, Father collapsed and sent to hospital, His sister (my wife) with breast cancer, and this is years after losing his own brother to suicide (on a Christmas day). He lives next door, but we've never really spoken i've had longer conversations with random cab drivers in the nearly eight years i've known him. (Also up to that point, I had never set foot in his house...twenty feet away) The last few weeks we've spent a lot of time together long hours just talking and actually getting to know him as a person, both refreshing and gut wrenching.  As for your song "Cancer" I literally discovered your music this week, and listened to this at 4am this morning while I sat in my car outside the hospital, after bringing bro-in-law in to the emergency department, and my wife went in with him. She works with a lot of cancer sufferers and has made many friends, and sadly every few months she loses another, then sucks even more when it hits close to home...again.  So a shout out and thanks to both yourself and Nova, so appreciative for the song and the message you bring. Life continues but song's like this help with the journey.
This one hit REALLY heard.... I still miss you James. Thanks for reminding us how lucky we are Tom!
Lotta trolls gonna hate brother but your message is clear. Your doing the work of the Lord and I thank you...
My grandma (best friend)...survived breast cancer when I was younger. Then died from skin cancer later on....now my other grandma has breast cancer, another strong woman who helped me get clean when my own parents wouldn't even listen to me....fuck cancer....
The tears fall from my eyes. I've lost some very special people to this Cancer bullshit. I'm 50 years old my friend and I feel like your my little brother who I lost to C when he was 11. Thank you for the strength you provide me and he will always be alive until I see him again. THANK YOU in the realist way brother.
I've been fortunate enough to not have a close loved one die from cancer. My wife however, pretty much everybody in her family gets cancer, even some especially young ones, and they all end up passing. All of my grandparents have had mild cancers they lived through which is great but makes me feel so down for her. When in just a couple years 6 close family dies, I couldnt imagine and I don't even know what to say to help. This song made me throw my cigarettes out today but cant promise myself I'm done. This song hits me on an existential level that reminds me of the inevitable untimely reality of our death. I take so much for granted for having things others would do anything for and still have the nerve to feel down about life. Tom always hits me hard. He has inspired change and confidence within me that nobody ever has. I'll conclude with a stupid question. I feel theres a deep valuable meaning in a line that I have trouble interpreting. What does he refer to when saying we get cancer from keeping our demons a secret? Thanks y'all sorry for the long comment.
We never get used to death because it wasn’t ever supposed to be this way.  Thankfully it won’t always be this way. It has nothing to do with being good or bad.  We all have missed the mark.  But, Jesus saves!  He made another way!
When my grandma died, my 5 year old sister said "Grandma went to heaven and the pain went to hell".
Had to come and watch this again after Tom asked us to go support Nightbird. Which I did. ❤️
“Our best defense is to live like we don’t know what cancer is.”  If you don’t feel sick, don’t go to the doctor.  There is research out there, from reputable sources, that states that the majority of people will die WITH cancer but not OF cancer.  So many people have cancer and die from something else, never knowing they had cancer.  Cancer’s not the death sentence pharma would have you believe.  Please do your research before you have all these “preventative” tests done, before you let your doctor find something “wrong” and you die from the cure. But if you are sick, and find that you do have cancer, “fight it if you have it”.  You CAN beat it.  You are stronger than you ever imagined
Cancer took my father, 7-26-2020, I miss him every day. Love you Dad
Sleep Easy Mommom && Nanny.
Type in night birds audition on youtube ugh its sad .
Keep your phones away from your brains.  Nice song!!!!!!
My Mother and Vater both did not die of  Cancer but to the Chemotherapy in around 6 -8 mounts  with out " Treatmant "they woud have stayed alive for 4 -8 yeahrs longer  i say they have Cures for around 98 % of the Cancer the last 2 % are still left thas why they need Ratlabs like my Parents and your familey members  .... well sure the money also pays it part !  Onley my opinion  no offence Peace and Love to you all !!!
This song about cancer put a big lump in my throat 😭
This brought tears to my eyes remembering how I felt when the doc walked in and gave me that news. I was lucky. For those who have gone through this, this is something we worry about every day for the rest of our lives about if it will come back.
Wow....
i lost my rugby couch to cancer
man this song hit me hard. my dad passed from cancer. and this was uploaded  on my birthday
The hardest thing i ever had to do was watch my best friend slowly decline due to Cancer :'( absolutely horrible :( cancer sucks big time!! I believe there is a cure!! Just it will cost the government millions to put it into the medical system.
almost a year ago i lost my grandpa to cancer it still hurts
Soulful music!
god damn! why you playing on my emotions Tom?  just got into your stuff a few days ago with snowflakes but this hits me on a different level it brought me back to my time in the cancer center that saved my life surrounded by people who weren't as lucky. It truly helps knowing that people are thinking about and praying for you but this song is like an anthem to people who feel helpless, now I see you in a new light man, keep shining like a diamond and stay untarnished as gold
I can’t not tear up listening to this song, amazing
What a great song with such a great message!!!!
I just found out my dad's cancer is back. It was dormant in his lymphs for almost 10 years, but he's in the hospital with covid and double pneumonia... When it rains it pours 😢
CRYING BECAUSE THIS SONG IS SO REAL. FACTS ON TOP OF FACTS. THEY CLAIM THEY HAVE A CURE FOR CORONA BUT NO ONE FOUND A CURE FOR CANCER. THE DOCTORS. AND SCIENTISTS CAN'T GET PAID IF NO ONE IS SICK AND THE LAWYERS AND JUDGES AND POLICE CAN'T GET PAID IF NO ONE COMMIT A CRIME. GOD IS THE ANSWER. HAVE FAITH AND BELIEVE IN THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT.
Smoke INDICA MARIJUANA! It WORKS. KILLS CANCER CELLS. STOP CHEMOTHERAPY!!!! It’s KILLING You!
I've watch this video so many times  and my heart swells up each and every time because this is the truth of all truths and Tom has put so much emotion into it, I am not the type of man that sheds a tear  very easily but this has many, Again I want thank  Tom And Nova For a thoughtful and heart felt  and beautiful Song ,. God Bless U
There is a Cure for Cancer. Government know there is a Cure. They make to much money when people go through treatment. So they do hide the cure because they want us dead. Cannabis has shown and proven it kills cancer. I have seen so many people I love or friends go through this. It's heartbreaking.
I feel nothing but respect for Tom Macdonald, I cried with this song, I just want to say I want to thank the hospitals and doctors for helping to survive through a hard time in my life.
You won't know how to be brave To choose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength Till you've struggled to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith Till you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take Till you realize you didn't break  Deep ...
SO SO LOVELY
You CAN know where you'll go when you die. You admit you're a sinner, ( we all are, but saved by grace through Jesus Christ when we're forgiven)  repent of your sins, ask his forgiveness and forgive others who have done wrong to you, accept Jesus as your savior and Lord, believe in him, ask for the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and he will make his dwelling place in your heart. The Bible says the Holy Spirit actually seals you with the seal of salvation, in your forehead. In other words, you're marked with a special seal, as his own, and your name is written in heaven in the book of salvation, and the book of life. Every day, if you know you've committed a sin, ( we all sin, even after being saved, and we'll still fail, numerous times throughout the day) you repent, ask forgiveness with sincerity, and do your best to not sin again. Do your best to literally flee from temptation, whenever possible.  The Bible says we must each work out our own salvation, with fear and trembling, asking for the Lord's help to not fall into sin. But when you DO sin, there's forgiveness and power by the blood of Jesus Christ, and the power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus was our perfect sacrifice, and his blood cleanses us. The Holy Spirit is our comforter and guide, who seals us, gives us wisdom and discernment, and convicts us of sin in our conscience.  God never abandons us, though satan and his demons want us to believe that. But our salvation and walk with God, isn't always based on our own feelings. Many people in the Bible wondered if God had abandoned them at the lowest times of their lives, but realized later that it was satan making them think that, or their own fear and depression and lack of faith or feelings. God promised never to leave us, even at the end of the world, and our lives. God is the father of all, who loves us so much, that he sent his son to live and die for us, rising to life again, to defeat satan, death and hell. God wrote the beginning and end of our lives, and history, and he will have the final victory.
I never liked rap, too full of foul language and nefarious acts. Love YOUR songs though...I'm crying 😢
Minute 17:00 is VERY telling as to why we are so dis-eased! https://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/ Do you really want to keep supporting BigPharma/Cabal!?
My daughter just found out she has cancer.  I appreciate this song!
Mom just passed on sunday at 1:10 am from cancer she faught for 5 yrs i was by her side every day til the last i miss her so much
I don't think you can watch this and not cry if you have been touched by cancer in some way.
Thank you for all your songs... and thank you for this one.
I did my pet CT scan on Monday still waiting for results I had Ewing sarcoma stage 4. I've been Clean from December 2019. The worst about cancer is wat it does to the people around you, and seeing al the small children receiving chemo... Thanks for the song means alot
You made me cry so hard
Medical tyranny needs to be removed from this nation. We are hobbling around dependent on it economically, and it will kill us.
What utter filth downvotes this message of hope?
The best cure for cancer is prevention, which includes ALL of the things you list, including the things we give our children to eat and drink.  It's not abuse refusing the GMOs and sugars (natural and created) and "flavor enhancers" and "healthy drinks".  Educate yourselves about food values as relates to health. (hint: almost every restaurant in the world is concerned with taste over health)
Thanks for this song I been fighting cancer for the last year and with chemo a n radiation an pain an prayers you have said it all may God bless you always!
Don't understand why this song isn't way more popular. This should have blown up the internet. This should be cancers National Anthem .
My mother passed from cancer in 2006. She would hold her bible and look terrified. I tried to comfort her as best I could. She died in my arms with her mother, step father, and brother around her. My father sat with my son in the other room. I didn't want that moment to be his last memory of his grandmother. She didn't drink alcohol or smoke, but she was exposed to something (asbestos most likely) at work. The doctors gave her every treatment they could get her insurance to pay for. When she could no longer get herself in the car to go to the hospital for chemo (I couldn't pick her up I am a small woman) I called uncle and told the doctor this was her last treatment. It was time to focus on quality of life and her last days would be as comfortable as possible. Cancer sucks and there is too much money for the medical/pharmaceutical to give that up.
We pay them to kill ourselves...simple brilliance. Cancer ruins so many lives, great song to try to make reality clear
Facts! 👑💎👍🤜
amazing song, legit made me cry. I never knew anybody close to me to have any form of cancer. But I can't imagine the pure struggle it is.
Well done dude.  12 years Survivor myself. Thanks man, wicked tune...brought back alot of emotions
💕❣️💖💖☮️💗💗💗💗🧬🫀💋😢🥺
Srsly... where's the LOVE button
um... wow. Hey, Tom.. I'm just a combat vet, and have had close family fall to cancer and combat. I can't remember the last time I listened to a single song back to back this many times. I just memorized this. Today. You know when they say "this song sound like it was written for me" or some bullshit? Yeah, bud. I've been listening to a lot of you today. This one had me for the last three hours straight. Mine eyes doth flow, greatly, sir. Thank you. Thanks for Snowflakes, too. But, this, my dude, is what I fought for. Keep being your trash ass free A-fuckin'MURICAN self. And before that, keep being the great human you are. Us lizard people are depending on you. Your art, and that way of shoving ALL the truth *straight up* they nose. You are a musical Patton, mah dude. Like crap through a goose. Yeah, I'm drunk. On my own mead. Skal!   Have you done one like this for us Army fucks?
I like
🙏🏻
I love your truth.  I went through this with my Mother in 2003.  Every word is true.  I love your truth.  Thank you.  Keep doing what you do.  Please...
Damnit man. I’ve been watching your videos for the past hour or 2. I’m a 34 year old man, at 32 I found skin cancer and had to have a surgery to remove it. Got checked for more for a couple years, minor surgeries once or twice where I was able to drive home but nothing big like the first time. Fast forward to now, 34, I have to schedule a lymph node biopsy because I might have the shit in my lymph nodes now. This song brought me to tears. Thank you though. I’m going to do the best I can
A Really Great piece of music reaches the deepest part of the heart Thank U
My Tears fall on in an empty Glass but the day i meet our God The tears will fall on those who need Strength
What piece of shits 👎 this song? …
This made me cry. I'm currently battling cancer and my last treatment is soon ❤
Cancer Sucks!  I’ve been fighting it since 2009.
Damnit Thomas I may have just broke my hand thank you blessings upon blessings upon yours
Thank you Tom for doing this song. It reminds me every time I listen to it how strong I really am. Every time I listen to it I have tears rolling down my face because I think of my Mom and my best friend, both died (within two weeks of each other) of lung cancer. Then about 10 years ago my husband was diagnosed with Ideopathic Calcific Chronic Pancreatitis. I have watched my husband lose 60 pounds in less than two weeks then and he will never gain it back. Also to add insult to injury I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia 3 years after his diagnosis. This has become my anthem song, to remind me every day of how strong I really am and how far I have come through all the pain I feel 24/7/365. I have only recently become a fan of yours after watching "Fake Woke" but now I'm a fan for life. Again Thank you Tom MacDonald.  P.S. I'm going to introduce your music to my son and he's 36.
My mom. 2007. 💔
don't know how he kept from tearing up through this song
I was diagnosed with cancer in 2017 my scans have been clear three years
Thank you Tom! This is an amazing song from a cancer survivor.
Literally lost my mom to cancer last night. I plan to play this at her celebration of life.
I'm in remission.  This song makes me not able to breathe.  Thanks for being so real n deep.
My Mom has 3 months to 6 months to live. Cancer
I watched one of my best friends die from liver failure,  this song still reminds me of her and all fighting she had to do to even make it five more years before passing.  Damn Tom, this song is moving.
RIP Austin Blackford..
powerful ❤️
Wow.
You are a good man !
Wow. You are a growing legend. Fantastic.
They have the cure ,but that doesn't  make money got to keep  you sick forever.
Hit me right in the feels. Tom MacDonald & Nova  thanks for being you and doing you not doing what the "norm" is.
Both my parents have had cancer. My grandpa died of cancer and so did his dad. More than likely I will die of cancer. It doesn’t seem to skip generations. But I’m ok with that. This place isn’t my home. By the grace of God I will be going somewhere better.
Its been a minute since I've heard this song, now it hits different, the first time I was just proud of Tom, this time I was damn near in tears
How many ppl have u helped ..will you help being you brother????? Please do t stop telling us what everyone need to hear!!!!🙃🙃🙃 some r chosen some just  choose there selfs...TY FOR BEING U BOSS
wow
Tom MacDonald is a human i respect 100% and wish all the best to him and to his friends and family . . .Love from the other side of the world
Thank You So Much sweet Tom for this anthem!! I lost my mother to cancer 35 years ago . She was only 42 . Every time I look at her pictures it hits me like it just happened yesterday! I wish she could have met my 8 children. Now that I’m a grandma I miss her even more . I’ve lost several dear friends over the years to cancer . Your song makes me cry , but they are tears of catharsis and hope . Love your videos!! May the Lord Bless you dear one !
My nephew passed away last year from cancer and it broke me. This song is amazing.
I never want chemo or radiation,like several the songs
Crazy how a client and I were just talking about this the other day. I have been a fan of Tom's ability to not only articulate messages well while also not being afraid to speak the truth. I stumble on this song while making a YT folder of favorites and some of the lyrics are almost word for word from the conversation my client and I had. With all the doctor's, speciality clinics and hospitals that deal with cancer along with big pharmas profit hungry model what incentive do they really have to allow or create a cure? With that in mind where does all the donated $$ go?  Not to mention at the same time Tom is spitting the truth this song is really inspirational for people and their loved ones at the same time. What a amazing artist to be able to blend truth/inspiration/hope and love for others who are struggling. Amazing!
really people would hit thumbs downs. common man, love ya nova and tom.
thank u i am one of those who put out a lot of money to docs no answers
This song should have 20 million views by now. We need to blow it back up
Songs great my mom fight this shit for 8yrs the good Lord took her 6 months ago miss the hell out of her any one with cancer your in my prays
cancer is old the new disease are auto immune and chronic pain, something my sister and I along with many others suffer from.  Just 2 years ago I was wondering if I would even live to be 30, and frankly I had no desire to continue living life in such a state. I lost everything but somehow I was able to come out of it stronger than before.  My sister still needs to take chemo at least 1x a year just to survive.   I took responsibility for my life and stopped thinking doctors should heal me. I was able to heal myself by changing my life including my mind.  The doctors from various fields could do nothing for me. I am fortunate compared to so many others, my best advice would be stay in motion and change your diet to what is best for your own body not what others say.
I felt this track man. Deep.
D@mn this made me cry like a baby. Good song.
They have the cure. It's a money maker for them so why would they want the cure to be exposed.
I'm convinced you can change the world Tom! ❤️
Lost my mom to cancer. Thank you for this!
Listening from wa 👍🤙🤙
Just finished my treatment.   First heard this song when I was first diagnosed.  It gave me courage, it gave me strength, it gave me the words I needed to hear.  You're the best.  You spark inspiration.  Thank you for your amazing gift.  Tank you so very much for sharing it.
I don't have cancer, neither anyone in my family. Just went to hug my kids after hearing this. Makes you realize how short and fragile life is
It's coming Tom. Thank God!   https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19339868.university-edinburgh-scientists-successfully-test-cancer-killing-trojan-horse-drug/
Bro, sometimes your songs are too fuckin fire. I fuck around and listen too hard and...get fuckin burned.
I never met my grandfather because of pancreatic cancer
"You won't know how to be brave til you choose to fight when you're afraid" ...I would love to have that tattoo ... although there are many other Tom McDonald lyrics I feel the same way about so I think I will use that excuse instead of my being to chicken
WOW, this song really hit me emotionally.  I needed to hear the words of encouragement   Thank you for being the messenger that I needed to hear.  I am a fighter, when things get hard I plow on.
I lost my dad a few months ago to cancer and I’ve been listening to Tom for the past month n love all his songs but just clicked this one and started bawling.. such a good song it’s unreal. Thank you for everything Tom. Your music is helping so many people get through difficult situations.
Momma died from Cancer 35 years 💔 😢 😔 ago. R I P.   Mom.

Tom is a legend
I've lost my mother my sister-in-law and my father-in-law to cancer and it sucks. But I know where they all are . Thanks Tom for the reminder of them. It did bring tears to my eyes to hear this one but it's memories of them all. Thanks for all you do.
I am a 49 yr old mother of 5 who's own mother passed away from cancer when I was just 12 yrs old. Nobody talked about it. Friends and family avoided us. Thank you Tom for saying the things that our society is simply afraid to talk about. It is about time this world finds a voice and compassion for others hurting. And you Sir, are my voice. So thank you.
Pray is all we can do
Truth! I have been in remission for  3 years from Stage  3C Colorectal Cancer. Everything you said is true. There is to much money to be made on cancer. I have insurance but I am still paying for medical bills. I always said I am sure they can cure it but it is to profitable to cure. The treatments can keep you alive sometimes but it takes a very heavy toll on your body!!!!
My son is a survivor of t cell leukemia . Diagnosed at age 5. He is now 18. His brother a year younger severely autistic. Diagnosed a few weeks after the cancer diagnos. My boys on disability,  my child support taken by the government because its  considered income. All there money for 15 years spent to survive while literally trying to survive. They have never had much because of it. If I could figure out how to generate like 64k to pay off their little home I would do it in a instant.  it would give them the ability to kinda enjoy some of what they get. Awstin in remission but struggles socially and just got out of hospital after mental hold. His younger brother 17 and reads at a first grade level which is better than no talking at all. They need each other though . Anyway now my father in law is terminal and has maybe a few days left on earth. A resident of Canada but has been in US on a passport for years. Even served in the Air Force as a resident of Canada. No idea how that worked but he no longer is coherent with the now. Its so dang sad. Its like his brain is thinking about stuff as a child. Anyway cancer sucks and other crappy things as well. Hope that anyone dealing with this kind of crap has the courage to stay strong and fight.
As a cancer survivor this song really hit hard home for me. I spent 3 years in and out of the hospital. Became homeless struggling to survive not just cancer but a broken system that is designed to maintain the status quo. A healthcare industry that caters to the donation giving patrons but neglects the lower class patients that need help
Lost my step dad to cancer in March and we listened to this song everyday rip don...1,2,3,4 united states marine corps semper Fi in heaven marine you are missed
My brother had leukemia he had just turned 7 he died the next day exactly 2 days after this song was released.
Still haven't made it through this song without crying. Watched it about 100 times. If I ever quit smoking and drinking, this song will be why.
Thomas I want you to think about this. Do you think that God wants us to live forever? I don't think so. If you see how intelligent man has become why would you want to see anything worse than what we are today? It's likely become more intelligent just to learn a new way of killing each other. Yes I know the beauty the music The Words the dance everything.  Some say that when we die we don't remember those that we think we would miss when we're alive and think about dying. I sure as fuck hope that ain't true. Cuz then I'm coming back and I'm just going to haunt people and anybody that will listen to me; Mom Mom Mom she left me. He owes me
I don't know how anyone can't like the video!
Love the message
Your words are so touching. Keep it up. You’ve made a fan out of me for sure. Thank you for the music you write. It’s powerful.
Heard this song on TikTok great job man
I lost it listening to this. I listened when it first came out, needed to hear it today. Thank you, Tom and Nova🌬💜
Just lost my dad to lung cancer from complications due to military service. Thanks Tom ❤
There are still people who dislike these kinds of videos?🤣
I wanna know who the 3.4k pieces of shit who thumbs downed this!?!?
I just lost my closest aunt to cancer last week.. this song made me cry, but it's so true.  We spend so much money on stupid things like giving other countries millions for "gender studies" but we can't get a cure for cancer????!!!! I've lost 6 in my family to cancer now and like many others sit and wonder if I'll be next.
Beautiful
Dang Tom.    Another grand slam.     You are the man.    Thank you for this emotional roller coaster right here       That girls weak smile.   Wow.         Jesus is real Tom.   He loves you.  Loves me.   Loves all.    But our evil (as you speak about) have screwed up what was suppose to be a utopia world.   But there is Hope in the storm.  An Anchor that holds.  A Savior and Lean to that can handle our burdens and take our pain away.
cancer is evil... survived kidney cancer here.... thanks TOM.... Stay strong ALL...
The Malthusian Trap answers a lot of  why don't "they" fix this questions.  I'd love to see a rap about the real unfortunate truth.  Then float a % towards me cuz I'm broke af. 👍
Fuck this dude doesn’t miss 🎯 this shit beyond touching. Appreciate you Tom 🙏
How the fuck has this has less than 3 mill views? This is Macklemore's " Otherside" again. People wake up!!
I wasn't ready for this
Brought me to tears. Very impactful. Nova you caught the emotions so vividly. Just like so many here my family has been impacted by cancer my nephew at 4 years old  battled and beat it. My mother battled and beat it about 3 yrs ago. And we lost an aunt to the fight 6yrs ago. If you have it fight. If you know someone with it be that rock they can depend on. Amazing!!!!
My mother passed away from breast cancer that spread. Thank you for this song. You are a gift to us.
Truth!
This song hit hard. Growing up I watched my Mom deal with cancer, get into remission just for it to come back. Took care of her for 6 years, standing by her side through all of it and doing what needed to be done. 5 years ago today she let this world for the better. She left a spark in all of us and we never go a day without thinking about her. Now my Dad is diagnosed with cancer. I think I might have to live through it all over again, but this song, this song helps. Thank you!
Best rapper out there by far not just the lyrical quality but the truth is amazing
I wish he would make a song for my sister
There are very few artists out there that can truly bring chills to my body, and I can think of 1 artist that has ever brought tears to my eyes. And now I have a 2nd artist to add to that list. Your words are inspirational, your lyrics nothing but pure truth even when people don't wanna hear the truth. Tom, you are the fire that burns in dark. The dark parts of our souls are so much brighter with you in them. Thank you for keeping it real, spitting the truth and facts. You truly are on a whole other level that all the other so-called rappers or artists only dream of ever being on but never will. I don't know what else to say, my eyes are still trying to recover from the message in this song, and how relevant it is not only to me but every other human being that has gone through, is going through or will go through. YOUR A LEGEND
I refuse to die in a hospital
I'm done fighting I'm n so much pain
I don't want to. Die.  Please. Help me.
My dad passed from cancer this song hits deep bro.
Wow
You're the best, Tom! My mother fought cancer for 22 years. She was a fighter, never complained. When they finally had to tell her that she wasn't going to make it, she said there were so many things she still wanted to do. I imagine if there is a place we all go after this, she is still busy and hopefully able to enjoy what she loved here on earth. My daughter and I try to do some of the things she loved. I feel some how like she lives on in my daughter, whom she never even met, she died 9 years before she was born. Thank you for all your words and the truth you speak. You have a true gift and unmatched talent!!!!
So happy of have found this song. Thank you so much, Tom. Just found out I have cervical cancer. It's a terrifying time but this song helps a lot. My husband plays this song on repeat while grasping my hand. I can't thank you enough for lifting me up. 🖤
Ty bro, my mom had breast and ovarian cancer. She is in remission 10 years later. My dad... He had lung cancer and brain cancer. He wasn't as lucky, passed away last month. Cancer is so bad in recent years. Kiss and hug your family, they can go so fast. My dad died just a few months after his diagnosis.
God bless you Mr. Tom MacDonald! I have much love and respect for you and crew. Thank you for sharing!
You are so loving.
What kind of rapper writes a song like this?!   A man with a heart! Thank you!
Lost gramps a few years back to cancer he fought for 10 years strongest man I've ever met
Lost a great grandfather to a genetic form of pancreatic cancer runs in the family... might be the 4th kinda sucks to know that...
I wish you & Nova the best.  You 2 are a very deep blessing to our world 💛❤🧡 I love how you speak so much truth & wisdom.  You are and angel , Tom. You both are a very lovely team.. Dont ever change
My oldest son had probs this is the best song ever you are the best tom dont let anyone tell you different i support you a million percent brother keep it up your a genius thanks for this loving video brought tears to my eyes for my oldest son again thank you tom.....
Tom this is a great video even if it's hard to watch. I sort of hope that was the point though.
Thank you Tom.
My mom of small cell back in 09. Trained myself not to remember the exact date. But I was there, in early October that year. The 3rd or the 5th. I plead.
Get propper public healthcare....USA is sick
I found this song at work on my lunch, my mom got diagnosed with cancer for this second time  a few months ago ,  got a grown man about to tear up,  Good shit tom
Thank you Tom. I had cervical cancer, means so much!💔♥️
From a 5 time survivor,  thank you  , this song hits the point
LOVE IT!!!!! KEEP ON GOING!!
Epic Thank you! 🙏❤😇🦄❤🙏 ..... 🤔🧐😶
Tuuuune 🔥 #TheWorldIsCorruptAsFuck
That's so true so much money and no cure its been so long still no cure 💔
Shave for the brave people! (who want to show your support)
So true, “Racing for a Cure” all of the Holistic Doctors were ran out of the country years ago. There’s no money in Natural Cures. Radiation & chemo Blasts out whatever chances your body had of trying to heal itself. It killed my Grandfather & my cousin. Most of the Natural Cures doctors relocated in places like Cuba & Mexico. Poor Dr. Sebi from Honduras, he had the cure, he met his fate in prison. Shame,
This is a tribute, that I would buy a bracelet for.
Love this song not only I lost two due to cancer and almost lost a third but she fought harder but bro I wish you could do a one about the demon epilepsy.
Doctor sebi cured all diseases; controlled doctors said there was no cured for!
Thanks just got diagnosed few months back with Adenocarcinoma So I haven’t been doing great
Just the comments on this song hit me hard
Tom . . . I am a 2x cancer survivor that has lost family to cancer, its so hard to think I'm who beat it twice while others fall there first time through,    this song hit me in a weird way, it was inspirational, sad, uplifting,  hard to hear, but needed to be said.    This song leaves me emotionally drained every time I hear it.  I'm a sociopath but this hits me in the feelings.    Thank you so much for recording it.
Real talk
Cancer free since 2015. There is a place called Beljanski Foundation. They have answers and the cure for Cancer.  The government won't approve it because it is all natural. Read Sylvie Beljanski's book The War Against Cancer. I am a living testimony.
Nutrition > Medicine
Fhking Conputer Generated People disliking these song has no heart    _ Tom ❤️
Cancer ABSOLUTELY has a cure.... its too much of an industry to give up. You are just a number to to be studied for medicare or other insurance companies. Never forget that going forward.
This man deserves his respect👍👍
I recently lost a woman that I love to this.....we met late in this life and agreed to spend the next one together.
This song hits the heart my dad is dying from stage 4 bladder cancer he doesn't have much longer he's been in a nursing home for awhile now I hope he keeps on he's a tough dude.
Gosh dang it this made me cry.. my poor pappaw..
My grandma has colan cancer ❤️🙏 lost my mom's grandfather to it😓
Just learned about you a couple months ago. I have not listened to this song. Becouse I was afraid too. Dont know why. I listened to it today. These words I needed to hear. I just got diagnosed today. Thank you for you're support!
The electric smog we live in doesn't help at all...
I know our Father's real cure for cancer. Me typing this is proof. Anyone gets cancer all they have to do is google alternative cures for cancer and read. Don't listen to the lies your doctor tells you. Big pharma won't let them tell you the truth
I lost my mother to cancer last year bro You just brought a tear to my eye Tom
This was a tough song to listen to I watched my best friend fight pancreatic cancer for 3 1/2 years. I went to almost all of her treatments and sat by her side through it all. I helped on every way I could from sitting at the hospital for hours on end or being with her when she had her head shaved, cleaning her house or running errands to help her family care for her when she could no longer do so in her final weeks. The first hospital we went to gave up after after 9 months. She found a cancer treatment center in another state and was flying weekly to get her treatments. I went with her to most of them. The cancer center we went through was really amazing. She did so so well for 1 1/2 years. Things were looking up. I know the survival rate of that particular type. She passed away 15 months ago. The last 3 months of her life she could no longer do treatments. She needed a caregiver to travel with her and insurance stopped paying for it, she could t cover it and neither could I. She could not travel on her own and her husband needed to work so they could get by. 15 months ago she had a massive stroke, her body was already weakening.  I still have the text from her husband that they were at the hospital. I dropped everything and rushed there. They sent her home on hospice because there really was nothing they could do and she wanted to be home with her family. For a week she fought. A hospital bed was brought in and into her living room. I slept on the couch for that last week taking turns with her husband and adult children caring for her. I was with her when she died. It still hurts to talk about it. I miss her so much her family was my family and mine was hers. I would do it all over it again no longer how much it hurt to see. She was an amazing woman. She spent almost 30 years in health care working with people with developmental disabilities and low income families. Sorry for such a long comment.
Thank you for this bro. I'm fighting cancer for the second time in my life and I'm only 37. Cancer has no cure only remission. I appreciate you spitting the truth that big pharma doesnt want a cure because they make billions off the treatment. Big pharma and insurance companies(if you are lucky enough to have a policy) love treatment bcuz they get paid over and over but if they cured you they could only get paid once. The treatment is worse than the cancer in alot of cases. It's actually killing you just like the disease. The dr's hope is that the drugs/radiation/chemo they're pumping into you kill the disease before they kill you. FUCK CANCER!!!! I'm gonna beat it again and thanks to you this song is the anthem I'll do it to. Thank you so much bro!!! Keep telling the truth and exposing the lies we are force fed daily!
Lost my Dad at 45, my brother got cancer at 20 died 49, My cousin aged 6 and just lost my Mum. Cancer stole my chance of having children. I'm still alive though. See how long I can go on.
I have stage 4 Colon Cancer, been fighting since 2019, been thru surgeries, chemo, clinical trials, name it I have done it, your song gives me the strength to keep fighting and hear it every time I feel it’s too much, even when my Faith is strong!! Thank you for this song and pray one day there is no cancer for anyone! 🙏🏼
To all those who have gone through, or know someone who has gone through cancer. I really empathize with you and I only wish I could do more for those out there that struggle.
Could really feel the emotion in this.
Type 'cancer is serious business' into YouTube. The c industry is suppressing the cures.
Whoever have listened to this and ain't crying, is not human or have't lost anybody close to cancer. Lost my Dad back in 2001 to pacreatic cancer, on my birthday. Needless to say, I've celebrate my birthday with mixed feelings every year since. Blessed for having one more year of good life and having had the best dad in the world, but sad because he was taken from us too soon.
Who wants insurance we want assurance. Keep up the good fight Tom
Thank you Tom...my fiance had her dad got diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer...then 2 months later she found out her mom also has cancer...all while she is 6 months pregnant...please keep speaking truth bc it helps us little people
Dam. been a long time since i got goosebumps from a song
More than half my family has died of cancer, and my dog too.
My sister died December 23, 2019 of cancer.    RIP Raine, I love you.
Dam dude. Not a single wasted syllable. Every track from tom has more wisdom love and truth than Most artists can Express in their entire career truly an underrated genius.
Than you been there recently and I won't give up for my 2 lovely girls,,,,,Shout out to Hana and Mara  my only true loves on this planet except music....
For the love of money is the root too all evil. They have a cure and refuse to use it because the cancer is worth more than the cure itself. Money over saving lives is pure evil.
Wow!!! This just touched my heart! God Bless!!!!!💜❤️💜
cancer is man made. our body works very hard to fight the toxin. it bundles is up. then the doctor pricks it. and it is spread again. and the body has to do that work again. and radiation. yeah we know what that does. all by design. de population.
I'm in remission from acute myeloid lukemia. I just discovered this song and it means so much. I know so many people that are fighters and could use this inspiration❤️
Pharmaceutical companies are the devil and murder as many as the police
Hey, you reading the comments. Stop for a second and just listen to this song, I'm dealing with this shit alone. Pay Respects to the fallen
The fact there are people that will dislike a song about Cancer. Proves we have scum bags in this world.
Now thats a fight song
My god what a great song!
I know I am a little late but came across this song and my gosh it is so true and so honest. Saw my dad go through cancer and he was one of the lucky ones who has been in remission for 10 years but not everyone is so lucky and this song just hits so different when you know someone. Such an amazing song and thank you so much for songs like this Tom!
We all personally know too many who suffered and still are.  Hundred Billion in profit and growing, answers why Healthcare Elites secretly keep the cure from the  People. Diseases and ailments that can be healed through  frequency is astounding.
Just came across this and you are right, there is a cure but the pharmaceutical companies, medical and insurance companies won't allow it. They can't make Billions if people aren't sick and dying.
Great song!!! We can find a vaccine in months for COVID, yet we can’t find the cure for cancer over decades???? Too many have died to cancer and it needs to end. Just too much money on the line I guess??? Keep up your work Tom, I am a new fan!!
Thank you for this song.... Fuck Cancer in the face!!!
This is dope Tom!
Lost my best friend to leukemia in 2014. Forever wear his name on my body to remember him... Love you Scott. 🙏
My mom died of cancer. And your song remind me of that. A Dark Day My Life. Don't worry I learn to live with it. That's life you're not promised tomorrow. So live today.
Thank you for this!! You always tell the truth. The ama can't have people staying well because you can't make money if people aren't sick. I can tell you it's much better after this life
Thank you Tom.
I was declared in remission in June 2020. Tom man I thank you for spitting something to those who are fighting. Bless you homie.
Both my parents had cancer. My mom is in remission. My dad didn't make it. Then my best friend since we were 12, got diagnosed stage 4 ovarian cancer at 38years old. 8 months later she was gone.😪 She had little ones. Fuck cancer. Fuck those who let this happen. Chemo & radiation is highly profitable, for "them".
Your new song dear slim brought me to you. You have a fan for life in Georgia. I am a nurse who takes care of people who are dying physically and you are taking care of people mentally ❤🙌🤘🙏🥰
I lost my mom, dad, 14 yr old daughter, 2 uncles and multiple friends from Cancer one day it will probably take me!  Thanks for acknowledging those that go through the battle called cancer
:,(
Amen I'm a fan
i cry lisitening to your music. your a prodigy
A book and a half here lol but honestly.. This one hits hard. All 4 of my grandparents passed from cancer, my aunt, my uncle, a cousin and my husbands grandmother and aunt,  a good friends husband (withing a yr after getting married) and most recently my best friends sister. A couple years back I was told I had lymphoma.. Only to go for near 11 months for random blood tests.. To find out on the final test result day that the oncologist I was previously seeing was arrested for sleeping with a patient and that he (the new Dr) has no idea why I am even in that office to see her as I did not have anything close to cancer of any form.. 🙄 Waste of so much time worrying myself sick (low white cell count due to stress.. I was told later that the newest results showed them close to regular) in between appointments wondering what the hell I'm going to tell my kids if it ever came to it. The scare of my life, especially since it does seem to run through the family. That aside..the government/cancer industry/corporations etc... They don't want to save anyone.. They want money and population control, after all.. they hold all the cards.. It's disgusting. All the power, blessings and hope to all those currently fighting. You are so loved, stay strong! 💪💪
Tom, Tom, Tom. What an incredible message of love, hope, and strength. Thank you.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
💯♥️😥😭
"Our best defense is living like we don't know what cancer is, fight it if you have it and pray there's something after this"  WTF,, where has this rap been over the decades???
All I can say is thank you you are an inspiration. I fight everyday. You make it a little bit easier. So thank you.😁
Yeah I lost my mom to leukemia in 2017 lost my grandma my grandpa Uncle best friend lotta people great song brah
This is it! I was smoking when I started this song and now im done!!! You're a true inspiration Tom keep it up! I'm about to change up my whole life and do what I should have done a long time ago!
Your video hits home 💔 we had to tell our 13 old child, our only child, that she has terminal cancer. She fought for over 3 years and it was relentless. She passed. We got told our dear friend, Dylan, who has been fighting same cancer for over 9 years, was put on hospice yesterday and he is not expected to survive long 💔 childhood cancer steals kids lives. I hate cancer so bad !!!!!!!!!
This is my new cancer fight song. We play it during chemo the T & A group, we have an 80 and a 91 year old in our group. I am the only original member twice over. This is exactly what it I see as my oldest daughter shows up on her face with her hand holding strong to her little sister, and my husband holds my hand so tight sometimes I think it will break. Thank you for this, you’ve touched many of us in Saskatchewan this week.
Living with leukemia/CML... What a beautiful song 🎵
Just went to friends funeral, a 25 year old Amish young man that left a pregnant wife behind. I showed him your video and it inspired him to be strong. Tom thank you for your music. God bless you and the ones you love.....
Dude! Thank you for this ❤️
The entire medical industry is all about greed.
People who dislike this vid:🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤢🤡🤡🤡🤡
Love it love it love it
Ayo this hits way different than anything else. Like cancer fucked my world up when I was a teen and Im just getting closer and closer to an age where it can again. Honestly I dont have a primary care cause Im scared theyll say cancer.
Nobody should even think about a rap battle wiyh this dude. Spiiting pure fire
😢😢😢❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 thank you!!!!
My aunt is sick from cancer and is currently in hospice with just days to live. I havent allowed myself to really feel my emotions yet but they just came out now. Thanks for this.
Fuck me. Now that's solid rap.
❤️
Your music make me cry. There is so much truth is the words that you spit out that it makes my heart ache. Thank you!
Tom deserves to get recognised he speaks the truth and he's put so much effort into all these videos....
My mom in stage 4 cancer. They said the chemo looks like it's working but also say there's another two years of chemo coming. I feel this song so much. Just like most of your songs. Thank you for everything!
😭😭😭😭
I lost my grandfather and aunt a month an half apart from cancer in 2011-2012 and still haven’t recorded from the loss. Cancer doesnt just kill the person.
This made me cry. Cancer has run through my family, well, like cancer. Thank you for this.
My grandpa died from lung cancer from smoking
They have the cure definitely they just don't want to put it out I pretty much know that much.
THIS SONG GAVE ME MY STRENGTH TO FIGHT LYMPHOMA STAGE 4 CANCER AND THE POSITIVE THINKING HELPED TOO THANK YOU TOM MACDONALD FOR THIS SONG I NEEDED TO HEAR IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE AND NO BETTER ELSE  THAN YOU AGAIN THANK YOU TOM
This one gives me chills bro. I love this one..lost all of my grandparents to this. It's horrible, and I can bet my life they have the cure.     There's far more money to be made treating a disease than curing it.   Why cure someone of cancer in a day? when you can treat them for a lifetime and bill them every step of the way..                                 SAD TRUTH   TOO MANY GREEDY PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD THAT CONTROL EVERYTHING   LIFES TO SHORT TO SPEND IT WORRYING, BEING SAD OR MAD.  ALWAYS TELL EVERYONE YOU LOVE THEM BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT PROMISED TOMORROW. GOD BLESS EVERYONE READING THIS, RELIGIOUS OR NOT.
For those who put a thumb down then you don't understand this song and for those who have love ones or went through it just remember your my heros and a huge inspiration same as Tom. Thank you for making this song and thank you for all the people who fought against cancer. I salute you.
This one is personal. Thanks Tom. God Bless all those fighting to heal. 💪🏼
I love this song so much the chorus is my ringtone for when people call😂
I never write public comments because the Internet is so cruel. But thank you for this song. I just found out, after fighting for over a year, I am CANCER FREE! I love all your songs, but this one hit harder for me. So anyone out there who is still fighting their fight, don't give up. You got this!
Thank you! My 4 year old niece died about a year ago from a rare cancer. Her parents did everything for her but lost her and they miss her. They make sure she is taken care of.
I’ve been saying this for years. The elite will not simply release the cure lightly when they’re generating an astronomical amount of money annually that people blindly hand over. It’s an entire industry funding their own agenda.    In 2008 my mother was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer and after a very short battle she lost her life. I remember that morning clearly as I went upstairs to my dad on the phone to 999 and my instincts kicked in so started doing resuscitation (refusing to believe she was truly gone). I still strongly believe the chemotherapy killed her because she deteriorated in the blink of an eye on that cocktail of bullshit.   I may be alone on this one but fuck the charities, I donate directly to the families that are going through this. This song hit me hard and I’m glad you are the one to sound this alarm for the blind Tom.
My father was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer last year it's a big hurdle last year definitely something I wouldn't wish on anyone you wake up every morning wondering if it's the last day you get to talk to them and it f****** sucks it hurts and it's not fair Tom thank you for making the beautiful music you do definitely helps a little bit
Great song Tom. I know some bars don’t have as much meaning as others do. But you know what’s next, but I agree , leaving all you know is very scary, even saved by Jesus Grace folks like me. You talk about angels and devils enough that I see you have a knowledge of the next. Keep doing you, I believe that regardless of self righteous folks opinions, you found the road God made 4 u. An in that I commend you brotha.
I just wanted to say thank you for this song. My fiancé is fighting breast cancer right now she’s my world idk Where I would be here when I would be without her.
This song is awesome 😆😓
Thank you Tom that was beautiful and inspirational
❤️
Amazing talent Tom and there is life after this. Go ask Him to show you. Gonna listen to it again.
I was diagnosed the week before this song was released. actually exactly 10 days before... i have a playlist just to help me through this journey that started with this song. its now 8-ish months later and still fighting!! thank you so much for the effort you put into this- a voice for all of us who may not be able to!
My husband has small cell carcinoma it's a very aggressive cancer. This song made cry. He's been fighting it for 8 months now. I just pray this new treatment works better.
Fought cancer twice, but still got an inoperable brain tumor.. go figure.. mom of three..  28 meds a day to live.. none are pain meds.. bc I won't let them see me blitzed. But my most required is the nausea med.. 😔
AINT THAT THE TRUTH
Man this brought me to tears you have such a voice bro and I love your heart it bleeds through your 🎶
My mom has cancer and i allways think it is because of me i gave her so much strress in life ,even tho i put her tru hell and back she still loves me and i am using every secend i have to hang out with her, go hinking with her , to go partying with her .She doesnt have frinds nor i.
my mom has skin cancer it scares me but my mom gets yearly screenings and it has worked.
Hé Tom, 💯👍 Although I am an old man, not a young girl, every time I watch this song it gives me new energy to fight my own cancer.  I❤U, 🖖😷👍❗
I can't stop until i hear every song.  He is brilliant, making me start to appreciate music again
Damn, I knew I was going to cry. I lost two family members to cancer. I wish they would take that money they supposedly spend on "treatments" and use it to clean up our world. Then cancer would stop taking so many lives. It is insane. It is evil that there are cures, but we don't ever get to see them. God bless the families that have to deal with this shit. Great video, yet again, Tom. Thank you!
truth
Thank God for Tom Mcdonald💯
Your a voice 4 the world and I dont even know if you realize brah!!!!!!!!
Dam man your song hits me hard. I lost my mom , I know 3 others with it now!!
Honestly if more people made music like this.  The world would not be so bad . NOTICE the comments. ITS ALL LOVE. Your song almost made me break down and cry . Its incredible.  Then i get into the COMMENTS . Almost every comment brought back the want/need to cry . Thank you tom .
I dislike rap,  but this is amazing, I love this!
*hears a Tom song* This is my favorite song of his *autoplay goes to next* No THIS is my favorite *this song plays* Me: *fighting back tears* yeah.
Tom macdonald I thank you for this song I just wish I could listen to this song without crying I lost both of my grandparents on my dad side died from cancer and now I'm dealing with my daughter she had blood test done and it come back positive for cancer we just got to go to the MRI scans the figure out where it's at in her body and what type I pray to God every night that nothing super serious. PLEASE KEEP DOING YOU I DON'T CARE IF YOU change it up.  I have come to respect you and love you as a person you could completely jump into a different Style music like country or Rock and I would still support you bro. # Respect
My two favorite people in the world died of lung cancer...I watched every day of it.  It is such a nightmare...great words Tom...
I had a ant who passed 2020 October from cancer I’ve never meat her but I wish some day I wil
I  am a survivor of aml. I am in remission thankfullly. Every day i m scared its going to come back. My god always be with me. This song is very special.
My best friend is my uncle Dan ! He has been fighting cancer for a long time idk how I’ll say goodbye. He is the reason who iam today
Thank you Tom! This song got to me at just the right time. Constantly fighting is hard, but your song makes it a little bit easier. #hangovergang 4evr!
Im crying. What a powerful song! I shaved the little left of friends hair off today,treatments for stage 4 lung cancer left her a few strands. Cancer is the worst!
my best friend, my life partner, my spouse...the strongest woman i know survived stage 2 breast cancer. It was the toughest year of our marriage we've encountered yet, and that was in our 1st year of marriage shortly after we got married she was diagnosed and we started fighting.
A PATIENT CURED IS A CUSTOMER LOST ... THEY WANT CUSTOMERS FOR LIFE ...
do not ever take chemo ... chemo makes so weak and destroys not only bad cells but all the good ones as well .... It kills you !!! cancer cure has been discovered decades ago, but Big Pharma would never let it be administered to the patients ... FOLLOW THE FUCKING MONEY !!!
Tom is the realist artist out there.  This song is 100... this song hits home with me and as well with everyone else who hears this song cant deny this. This has effected every family! how could anyone dislike this song
Thank you tom
I cried.
Amazing song! There are different cancers, but sugar reactive cancers can be starved by not eating any sugars or carbs. Sugar reactive cancers can not live on fats and proteins, but grow when we eat sugar.
❤ I love this song! WWG1WGA 🇺🇲
Love ya, man!!! Thank you!!!!
I posted u a couple months ago about this song. At that point one of my high school friends, 47 years old comments going through cancer. I did think about it first but I sent her your song.. she cried her eyes out and told me it was incredibly inspirational. She died today. I'm not posting this for attention. I'm just letting you know you made a difference in somebody's life
Wow.  Wow.  Dam   so dAm real.  Teared up up dude.  I'm a fan.  Word.
This song made me cry. 😭 So very true, and all my respect and love to all the warriors fighting everyday out there for life. Blessings!
Tom macdonald has a beautiful heart
This is great but I relate for another reason 💓
I’m here right now omg hard times
Sing it loud .the people sing with u .much love
I don’t even have the words so all I can say is thank you Tom. God bless you, Nova and all of us on this earth regardless of your beliefs..
This is truth
This is why Tom is the man. Unlike 96% of artists he's actually singing bout people, real shit, real issues we all gotta face. He doesn't cover it up in BS and cliches either. None of this sex and drugs and balla lifestyle crap. None of that my hearts broken it feels like I'm dying bs. Real issues, real facts, and an amazing formula with his lyrics, bars, and beats...and I've never really been into rap until I heard him.
someone was cutting onions when this song played, great music man!
You have a master ability with your words. I can only now watch and listen to this without crying. I've lost so many family members and currently have close friends battling cancer. This song is such an inspiration, you have no idea. Keep it up! 💕 thank you
I lost my grandpa to cancer and I love this, I may have bawled my eyes out but I love it😭❤
we need this song world wide
This song gives me goose bumps everytime,, #HOG4LIFE, LOVE YOU TOM
is there a shout out to the actors?
Greetings you fabulous Earthlings and Happy Friday!👋👽 I bring thin crust pepperoni pizza for everyone. Enjoy! 🍕
Jesus saves! I'm ready to die, this world system is evil
How can someone dislike this song..
Just WOW
Tear jerker wow
Oh, have I cried 😭! I am a breast cancer survivor, being treated at the moment.  I know where my strength comes from and it’s only because of God that I am strong by taking each day as a gift and trying to enjoy it as much as I can with a spirit of thankfulness.   This disease is not only from now, it has been proved that even in the times of the Egyptian pharaohs it was present. Let’s keep praying and pushing that more w is done to eradicate all types of cancer.🙏🏼
Omfg Tom damn it just damn it.love you man
Ty
Screw the people that dislike this.
I fucking love your music my mom died from cancer it will be 2 years june 5th
I just wanted to tell someone how my day is anonymously.  My lady and I had a bad day. Fighting... we both quit smoking, and we both have started dieting, and my mom asked me to shave her head cuz her chemo is starting to work... I'm good, moms will be, and me and my lady will be too. But I just didnt want to post on Facebook my problems so,  I thought if anywhere, Tom Macdonalds comment section
Im withdrawaling from suboxone as I type this but fighting fibromyalgia and gastroparesis daily. Thank you for this, Tom. Just thank you
Love this so much! Tom you're a legend no doubt about that bro🔥
I cry everytime I hear this. So painfully beautiful. Almost lost my best friend to medical malpractice when they went in to remove his thyroid cancer. Will never forget walking in and crying cause my dude was In a bed with tubes coming out of his throat and not bombing vets and grinding rails. Our friendship solidified that day. Out of tragedy sometimes comes the most beauty
Just found out today about my mom 😳😟😵😶😤😠🤒😩😱😢😥😥
Thank you for this song because it hits real deep! I never met my Aunt Brenda because she died of child hood Leukemia. I don’t remember my grandma Because she died of a cancerous tumor!  My Adopted grandma died of breast cancer. Cancel hurts every one!
For Cancer, look on the Medcapsules website for the use of Ozone. Your search may be case sensitive but you will be amazed that all those millions donated wasnt nescessary we had the cure for ages
I really appreciate you Tom I'm fighting stage 2 lung cancer
Thank you for having the balls to speak out on this Tom, not many do and damn sure not enough do.
AWESOME  THANKYOU !!!!!
My daddy survived 17 years and then got stage one lung cancer and the doctor was the real reason he died he didn't care or thought they have cancer they are going to die anyway it's wrong
Im crying like a baby! Right in the feels. For real.
This man speaks truth & nothing but the truth. May God bless & protect him.
Stop the radiation. Big pharma is the devil.
I was diagnosed with cancer last month.  I start chemo next week. I'm not looking forward to it, but this is my anthem going into this! Thank you, Tom!
Just got diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer. I will cancers ass. #HangOverGang elder forever send me good vibes H,O,G, FAM
Wow! I wasn’t sure what to expect...coming up on the third anniversary of my mom dying from brain cancer, this hit hard. I myself am coming up on the sixth anniversary of breast cancer, and there’s always that thought of what if it comes back.....
YT fact ie Im not a doctor but I heard from a video from a doctor that cancer can only be caused by a lack of vitemins , ie the type of disease it is always has its root in vitamin deficiency, also heard vitimin B17 kills alot of cancers that why the FDA banned Americans . ( Can buy on Ebay as plant supplement its made from apricot seeds  ) from having it ie no profit in the cure ,you might want to search for wilhelm reich here on YT and then there is the chinese doctors in china video curing cancer by effectively praying over the paitent . Seek medical advice only repeating what I have heard do your own research
Tom always killing it my mom's has the c word No likes!
Your music informs and inspires.
I scream that song in my car when I feel sad... damn that's good
😭😭😭😭😭
Keto and Intermittent Fasting is a good way to prevent it. Stop eating poison.
Goosebumps
the money is in the treatment not the cure i am sure it has been found
I'm dealing with addiction...I'm not gonna say what the addictions are just for not putting out my personal stuff.....but I'm worming towards a road to recovery and you definitely have given me hope to a beter tomorrow.......the hardest thing is the withdrawals.........there extremely rough and it's like so much on me I dont even have time for a rehabilitation center.....I'm trying my best to do this alone......its hard.......but I'm trying........just pray for me brother and keep making these songs man....there helping..........I love you man even though I have never met you I really hope I get to one day.....if you ever have a concert in macon GA trust me I will buy a ticket and I'm going regardless just to meet you......you ontop of alot of others like jelly roll and fj outlaw have really helped....love your music
Tom you have some of the best music for people going through something.....I pray I get to shake your hand one day man.......
You burn brighter in the dark<3
I would love to know Mac's inspiration for this beautiful song
There is definitely a cure...if you are a NWO puppet with a fuck-ton of money.  I've lost too many family members to cancer and it pisses me off that cure is only offered to the 1% elites.
Inspirational.
The beginning of that song is what got me. Because I know a lot about cancer my dad was diagnosed with liver cancer but what actually killed him was the hepatitis medication the doctor prescribed. Cancer itself however a good deal of tumor is cancers are based on blood acidity. What happens is the cells inside of our bodies die and they need enough oxygen to recycle and if they don't get that oxygen say if your blood is too acidic then they mutate and become malignant. So long as the cancer isn't caused by some form of chemical contact it's usually curable naturally. Lymphoma for instance, the FDA decreed and I believe 1996 or 1998 that iodine should be taken out of all baked goods sold in the United states. Iodine is an essential supplement for the human body and without it our lymph nodes don't function correctly. Since the removal of iodine from the baked goods in this country lymphatic cancers have risen over 300%. The best way to test is to put a dab of iodine in the arch of your foot. If it disappears and is absorbed by the skin within 3 hours you severely deficient. Tumorous cancers are best fought by alkalining the blood vitamin b17 is now outlawed in our country simply because of its curative properties. But a high concentration of them are found in the apricot kernel as well as apple seeds and dandelion Roots Believe it or not. The key is any vegetable eaten has to be free of pesticide and green vegetables are the best. Buying high pH water helps a great deal as well. But to anyone struggling or fighting out there I definitely wish you the best of luck because the world is not getting any easier and knowledge is getting more and more restrictive even our history is being rewritten. Don't always trust the doctor always examine consumer reports before any medication is taken. In regardless of what the doctor tells you CAT scans are full of radiation you can get as clear of an image with thermal imaging or sonogram which are safer. And radiation itself kills off billions of cells including cancer cells but if acidic blood is not corrected that leaves billions of opportunities for more malignant cancers to come. They used to base the survival rate on a five-year basis, now they do it on a one-year basis and say 90% survive. The reality is within a five year spectrum there is only a 93 fatality rate on average over a 5-year period. There's also a reason why cancer has only been around since the late 1920s, that's when people first started buying their food from stores and eating their fruits and vegetables out of cans. As well as the nutrition rate goes down sometimes as much as 80% from picking the fruit or harvesting the crop till you buy it from the stores and eat it. The real key to cancer is lack of nutrition. But nowadays even our organic foods have Monsanto antigens so the best thing anyone can do is get heirloom seeds and grow their own crop. It's a sad point of view but in accordance with reality it's also practical.
He's trying his best to turn the world for the better! Keep it up Tom !!
Once again you've touched my heart and made me think at the same time! The only words I can think of how I feel about your music as well as Novas are AMAZING!!! REAL!! INCREDIBLE!! I'm truly grateful you came along for you, Nova & myself 😉😊👍🙏
WOW. Just wow. Thank you.
You speak more wisdom in 5 minutes than biden in 50 years. I hope you can keep it up. God bless you.
R.I.PEICES
Pissing ,shitting and spitting blood and don't wanna leave my 3 month year old daughter but it'll prob happen but I know my brother will look after her
WOW.  Good stuff.  The medical community knows that cancer is a VIRUS, they HAVE known that for decades.  But no vaccination.  I suspect it is because there's so much more money to be made from keeping people sick and putting them through extensive, expensive "treatments."  And yet, look how QUICKLY they came up with a vaccine to "prevent" COVID.  Whole lotta money was made in these deals too.  Now that they have the mRNA technology, why can't it be used for cancer?  Most government and business decisions depend upon profitability, not morality.
I lost my mom last night to cancer thank you for this song
This hits home i had cancer, hopefully still cancer free ill know may 5th
Urine therapy  Bob beck protocol Coffee enemas  Gerson Method Fasting meditating gratitude  Cancer don't like none of these things
My aunt died of cancer today😿
At the end Tom is shaking. Anyone else notice that?    Btw, I'm trying to lighten the mode from "I had cancer at 24, and now 54 and cancer-free, this song and video hit hard."
Cancer no cancer you are beautiful never give up, cancer is curable but our health system doesn't care about our health just the money it makes them it's so sad
My buddy just told me about your music and you and Nova are good heart people I've had struggles in my life your music hits me forget about the haters let them hate I am a fan for life and God pless you
This song is touches my soul right now. I'm going through a divorce an my wife won't let me see my kids. It's been a month since I've seen them. An this song just helps an gives me strength to go on another day another hour. Not to take away from the pain of the people who have lost love ones to cancer or may be going through it themselves. It's just a beautiful song all around about strength an hope.
Who the fuck would dislike this song
As you said we donate money. They have billions. It's all about a cash grab. They find the cure. They lose money.
***dont let your child take the GARDASIL vax, they push it to boys (to prevent cervical cancer ) and girls at 12 but they dont need it. HPV isn't the end of the world. Neither is cervical cancer, at 19 they claimed I wouldn't be able to have children.  I have 3 blessings.  Let your body due its job. Please dont put poison in your body!
The chorus and bridge can be used for so many aspects of life( nut the the way you used them here.... Amazing!
Wow this hit me. I currently have a brother in law who was diagnosed with cancer. Thank you for this. Love you brother #DavidSturmer this made me think of you.
My mother and father both died of cancer about a week before my father died I was standing by his hospital bed and he said I have packed up smoking son,I wanted to scream at him it’s to late why did you not listen to me years ago.He died on the first of December he had know idea he was dying and a few days before he died he asked me if he would be home for Christmas it was the only time I ever lied to my father and the last.
This and one reaction has been showing up on my recommended list a lot lately and I've been putting it off because I lost my mom to cancer almost 14 years ago, I'm at work vibing and it came on, I wasn't ready, hard to listen to, invokes a lot of emotion!
Lived this ...First change should be that cancer doctors should not get paid to recondmend to you whatever the chemo flavor of month is. Its the only thing doctors get a kickback on. To me thats total BS and should at a min be required to tell you they do.. In my opinion.  Hardest part (after u past the idea of dying slow and painful) was watching what it did to the people around me. Crazy when u have to cheer them up when its you thats possible going to die.
"pray that there is something after this"......that is perfect. I lost my mom last August. She fought for 4 1/2 years after being told she had 3 to 4 months to live. Since then I have lost another friend, and now my cat even has cancer now. Mom always said we only have today...worry about tomorrow when tomorrow becomes today....that is all we can do.
Effing awesome, Tom!! Thank you!
I just found out my Aunt, who besides my kids is my only living relative has lung cancer that already spread to he bones since an MRI in January, so it's probably a super aggressive form. We dont know for sure what kind of cell since the biopsy results aren't back yet but its all through her. Doesn't look good. Thank you for this. We will fight to the bitter end.
my pops died of it last year prostate cancer he was a fighter till the last two weeks when they induced a coma before he died. the hospital put his cause of death  as a covid,  what a bunch of B.S. but he never got covid. anywho great song Tom ✌😎
It's crazy how YouTube hides everything because I've never heard of this song until watching a bunch of reaction videos to this poet right here...
I didn't even know about this song until today...my grandfather just passed from cancer today. Thank you Tom! You're an angel! 😇
You're going to change the world Tom.
I listen to this everyday for hope and courage while going through breast cancer...I pray whomever had/has cancer in your world Tom kicked ass and took names as all you wrote can only be known by someone who has dealt with this personally! You’re a gift from God!!!
Why does this have downvotes...? Guess you've never actually dealt with cancer. Ignorance is bliss I guess.
My aunt died from cancer less than a week ago...
TIS IS SENT OUT TO MY BROTHERS WIFE, SHE HAS KIDNEY CANCER/ SEND A PRAYER FOR HER BEATING IT
I had liver cancer I survived but I wouldn’t wish it in my worst enemy throwing up blood at 3am the chemo sucks the treatment is horrible but I’m here so I’m grateful I love this song it true very true
I cant stop repeating from 2:29  his vocal is on point . Thanks @Tom Macdonald.  Love all people.
I can hear Nova in there somewhere.  What an inspiration
For all still fighting YOU are not alone .ps lost my mum to it .XX
Wow! Powerful one. Lost my Dad to the C beast.
My first cousin whom I grew up with like a sister recently died of lymphoma. Every song of yours I've related to be n every level. This song got me missing her so much. ❤️
Tom , thank you for this! I swear it will be one of fight songs! I have just been diagnosed with metastatic cancer. The insurance company are refusing to even letting the Dr do the testing to find the origin. He's fighting like hell for me! But at this point I only have 25 percent chance of survival. I do have my God and full faith in what he can do! I also believe his promise that I'm assured of where I will go! But want to thank you and Nova for the music that holds me up and give me strength to fight!
Love you Aunt D. Keep fighting. 🙏
Thank you brother!!! As a cancer survivor this one really hit home for me.
So did the little girl live?
As an MD I am so thankful you made this song. It is absolutely correct. It is good that there are still observant people in society that does not blindly believe in the lies of "medicine". There are other alternatives out there. Be willing and open to look at other possibilities.
This DEFINITELY hits home.  My dad just found out he has throat cancer and had to do chemo & radiation. He just finished his last round on Monday.  We went know if ALL gone until June 28th when he is retested. Then I'd not,  surgery to get the rest. Praying with EVERYTHING I HAVE ITS GONE.  I can NOT lose my dad. I'll never be ready.
My wife has cancer. We are just at the beginning of the fight. Friday they are pulling out all of her top teeth to accommodate the radiation. This song helps me. Thanks from an old man.
Listening to this a lot today. My sister is going in for breast cancer surgery (Double mast) today. Its been over 8 hours and I can't seem to get an update. So Tom is basically sustaining me at the moment.
I hate you! You made me cry! Hero's don't always wear capes!!
Amazing!!!
I wish this song was around when my mom had cancer. She would have really appreciated it.
Blown away everytime.. Tom you're on a mission and I truly believe God is working through you to better this world. Keep speaking for us who don't have a voice. I hope I find mine one day. The amount of courage you display is phenomenal. Much love to you and your beautiful partner ❤️
Goodbye grandma ❤
Colon cancer. Caught early. Still needed surgery and treatment. Not fun. Lifted weights the whole time. Fuck you cancer. .......Awesome song!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
damn I got tears on this shit
I had cancerand and I thought it was the scariest thing in the world until my husband, my best friend almost died. He was in a comma for 11 days and every day there was something else wrong with him. This song spoke to both of us because don't know how strong you are until you are faced with tragedy. Tragedy can mean anything to anyone, addiction, cancer, a loved one in critical condition, or being the one in criticalcondition condition. Your words are perfect, keep writing a sharing your incredible work.
Yo, the 3.3k that disliked it are for real sick in the fucking head.
Awesome...I am always trying to come up with ways to get people to listen to your music...I have a YouTube site called Therapy w/LilCubbie...I am using your songs as the therapy. I believe there is therapeutic value in your songs if one would just take the time to listen to the message in your words. As a 50 plus year old I can remember being young and liking songs but I never really listened to the words or maybe I just didn’t care to understand the message. Hell...I was just a kid enjoying the beat of the music never really hearing the words. But with Tom MacDonald songs it would behoove one to truly take the time to read the lyrics as the song is playing...especially the old older songs that have his struggles prominently displayed for all to hear and understand...It was therapeutic for him to write and sing them and it is for anyone listening that can relate.
The worse part about cancer is not losing the ones that I loved because of it. It is because we have had the cure since the early 1930s and the greedy demons still keep it hid. Yet this is free will be being used against us. Yes he is always listening,...........☝️
Beautiful  Prayers for those who are fighting and to those lost 🙏😔🌹
💞
My dad and grandma both had cancer. I thank god everyday that their with me.
Tom your so invested in this song ...the screen oozes with emotion ....touched me real deep  literally making me cry .
Ty for being so real and showing us the right way.
Thanks brother. I lost my 2 uncles on mom's side just as I'm getting to know them. I'm an angry human being. Thanks for helping me keep it in check. Also thanks for being our voice.  You always say the right shit.
Wow man this song right here is 😭💣♨️☄🔥🔥 no homo but I wish I could hug you for creating this song! All of your songs are awsome🤯!! Thank you !
I lost my grandfather to cancer, he's left a massive hole in my heart! I'd do anything to have him back.. broke my heart listening to this song x
The dark day in 2009 April 16th ,I lost my dad due to brain cancer , I know he watches over us 12 years later❤💯, thank you Tom
✌️😘🤘
Thanks Tom!!  I miss you M0M
chlorine dioxide
The only rapper that can hit me in the feels 😭
Thank you for this song. It is so powerful.  My husband’s cancer is back. 😢. It’s in his lungs and has spread to his bones.  We refuse to give up. We refuse to give in.  Faith we hold on to.  Again thank you ❤️
I lost my wife in 2017 to lymph node cancer. We all know they can cure it, it's another way to kill off the poor
My daughter and sister is suffering with this.
So true and so bold. Keep it up Bro.. your music hits more than anything out there today.
Dope song Tom! My Mom has cancer and this is inspiring. Thank You brother.
That right how is it they find the vaccine for covid but they can't find the cure for cancer I send all my prayers 🙏 😢 😔 ❤ too every one that's going through cancer amen 🙏
I was told I had cancer & I told the doctor I was going to poop it out & mail it to him .  Cancer can't touch me ,I'm a healing warrior & there is a cure - RSO . thanks for keeping it real & self healing is REAL
Just found this song and I'm sad it took this long for me to find it ! I'm 47 and lost my mother to cancer when I was 15 thanks again Tom for helping  me see the truth !
Lost ma! This last Nov. I will stand up. I fight. Miss her!  stand up all lets gooOOOO BEST FOOT FORWARD!
I lost my younger sister and most recently my beautiful 21-year-old.   It's been 4 and half years.  It still brings me to my knees.  STRENGTH AND COURAGE TO ALL WARRIORS.
I cried.
My god this song stirs up emotion.
Every song has a message.... For Every fear he has an answer... Life lived.
very touching tom amazing i miss my grandpa so much he was soo strong he was fighter
Well I guess I'm one of that 40% at 40yrs. I pray that I can be around to see my daughter get her license, graduate and move on to do great things like her mother.   I pay for the most expensive health insurance but it still feels like I'm not getting the help I need. I get no help but I still recive bills every week. They gaslight me all the time, our healthcare system is as flawed as our government and police force.   I wish I were a celebrity or just rich. Then maybe the specialists will listen to my doctor.   If it gets worse I told my wife we'll get a policy on me. When the day comes I'll just make it an "accident". At least they'll get something out of this fucked up situation even though I know she'd wish I'd could stay.   Contingency plan. I will fight to the end but when it  comes down to brass tax. I'm going to make sure they will be okay. No matter the cost.  If you listened, Thank you. If not, thank you too. Be well and love as much of this life as possible. When they say life is too short. They were not lying. Make sure to stop to smell the roses sometimes. If you have hatred in your heart it's never to late to kick that shit to the curb.   Thank me later. 🤙🏽🙏🏽🖤
Been through radiation on left breast, killed my heart and I knew it. 💔 Speak to radiation techs and effin stupid Dr's sooner than later. Seeing cardiologist these days 😡 Plus surgery, lymph node shit. We're fuckin lab rats
Two words: Sound waves That's the cure
😥mom🕯thx Tom for this masterpiece❤
lost a mother, grandfather, and uncle to cancer in the span of two years. This song cut me like a bone saw. Great stuff.
Just listening to this, reading the comments of all the loved ones lost, and the ones still fighting or even the survivors... Just look at all the different kind of people Tom and Nova have brought together?  The community, the togetherness, Tom is what WE ALL need to hear.  So inspiring to have watched him from the beginning.  This song has special meaning to me as I am sure it does with many others for the same reasons.  #survivors #neverstopfighting #yourstrongerthanyouthink.
Incredible
I literally started balling, my Gan fought breast cancer twice and then died of stage 4 bone cancer and watching her in hospice frail and cant eat because the cancer ate her stomach away. I hope everyone who has cancer fights through it and comes out on the other end❤❤
There are rumors that there is a cure for cancer! But we the people will never know of it or get it.. Beautiful song. I recently discovered you. Trough Facebook of all places!✨🤐
This hits SO hard....I'm sitting here sobbing.  My mother-in-law just went into Hospice Sunday after fighting cancer for several years.  We buried my father-in-law back in 2006 after only a 7-month battle with esophageal cancer - hardest thing I've EVER had to go through emotionally - it almost destroyed my marriage because neither of us knew how to cope with any of it.  Fortunately, we made our way through it and back to each other emotionally....and 15 years later, we're still together.  I can't tell you how happy I am to have found your videos, Tom...thanks to Officer Tatum!  I haven't been a fan of rap since my high school days...but YOU are absolutely AMAZING!!!!  Thanks to you, Nova, and Brandon for all your hard work!!
Tom, I just wanted to say thank you for this song, I sit here writing this with tears streaming down my face cause it hit hard and hit home.  I lost my Aunt to it, then my Mom a few years ago to Leukemia , a type that is inherited and I didn't know about it until she passed away. She was also a diabetic with a heart condition like me, but you never knew she was feeling bad she always wore a smile and said "God will take care of me." I don't speak about these things in the open like this but this song hit me so hard, straight to my core. And now I'm faced with a health issue that the doctors can't figure out and I am one of the uninsurable due to the fact I am a insulin dependent diabetic with a triple heart condition and what they call "Extreme High Risk" but not here to complain, no sir, I am here to say Thank you from my heart for this song and many others you've put out.  You're a inspiration, Tom, don't ever stop speaking the truth. You may never read this or see what I said, but its here. Thank you. April 5th 2021
Wow. What an artist this man is! Respect.
@tommcdonald I just lost my sister to cancer and my heart is absolutely broken 💔💔💔 🙏🏼
It would take decades to count how many people have died at the cancer within the last 40 years
Cancer survivor. Crazy debt. I’m still here! Fuck the machine.
Rest In Peace sissy ❤️ this song has helped me so much!
😭😭😭 this song reminds me of my dad...
Powerful
So good...really...damn
why you make me cry so much man fuck i miss my dad right now so much
I just lost my little brother, David Scott Hanscome on  3/30/21 after an 8 year battle with a rare form of cancer.  He had to go from Maine to Boston so many times these last 6 months.  One of his stays in Boston I sent him this song... He appreciated it, but I think it meant more to me... I just can't accept that he's really gone.  I was holding his hand as he took his last breath...
Thank You!!!!!  Just needed to let everyone know I actually cried watching and listening to this.  I’m a true fan of this team!!!!
Teach and preach. More please sir
This video hit me bro 😭😭 my first love Taylor Goethals had it ever since she was a kid and she was my longest relationship she passed away in 2018 because of cancer 😭😭😭
Lost My Moms T 20 years now without her and I miss her every day. Cherish EVERY Moment with yours
HOW MY HUSBAND WAS CURED FROM PANCREATIC CANCER My husband's first symptom was pain right below the breast bone. He had also been on the Atkin's diet, and while he wasn't faithful to it, the weight just kept peeling off. We realized later it was due to the Cancer. Soon he had trouble eating anything without increased pain below breast bone, but turning yellow overnight was the symptom that led to visit to dr. He also started having greasy floating bowel movements. When he was diagnosed, it was already stage 4. The cancer already in lymph node and liver,we tried diffrent drugs and treatment but it was still not working,we spent alot of money on the process still no changes untill a friend of mine advised us to try harbal medicine,she told me about Dr Harvey and how he has been curing people from cancer and other deadly diseases with his herbal products,so we quickly contacted him and explain everythig to him and he Assured us that his herbal products can cure my husband so we purchased it and used it according to his priscriptions after 30 days, my husband went for a test and there was no trace of any cancer in his system.it was really a miracle am so happy about this, all Thanks to Dr Harvey. if you have any semilar cases or anyone you know kindly contact Dr Harvey now Via his EMAIL:[Drharveyphytotherapy@yahoo.com] or WHATSAPP:+16785689096 save a life today....
Wow... thats all I got!!! Tom you sir are a legend!!!
Say Tom , man Thank You 🙏 for this song today. I lost my Mom to Lung Cancer 11years ago to the day. I was just sitting here thinking about her, you YouTube drops this song in my lap that is, SOOO TRUE. Keep it real my guy. I love what you’ve done in the past (3) weeks. Keep on Keeping On, the new stuff is just as good and just as relevant today as it will for many years to come. You and Nova are quite a team together. Keep kicking azz.
My grandmother passed away and im sorry if you get hate for no reason man i love this shit be safe and everyone else as well
You ALWAYS say what I have been thinking for months.... Years.... Thank you
Thank you for this song. My Mom is suffering from glioblastoma and will be 73 on 4/5. She was diagnosed in 2019 so shes been fighting for 2 years. It's hard to watch her go from the strong woman to needing help to just make food and take her meds. This song really got me in the feels.
"We get cancer from keeping our demons a secret."         HOLY SHIT that's TRUTH.
This song showed up on my spotify release radar the day my mom was diagnosed with cancer, so it seriously hit home for me 😥
Dang Tom! Brought tears to my eyes...my wife is a breast cancer survivor.  Love this song!!!!
I lost my wife of 13 years to metastatic breast cancer 6 weeks ago. This song hit me in my soul.
This guy needs and deserves more subscribers than T-Series
I just lost my mum to stage 4 cervical cancer on Monday at 9pm... she wouldnt stop fighting but there was nothing more we could do :( I just wish there was something we could do....
Great job. You are truly a gifted person. Continue with quality songs like this and you will be around a long time.
Fuck they got X bruh dont let them get this mans. He's upfront with it. He's i. Canada so hopefully he is safe right now.
Lost dad in 2012 at the age of 69.  Miss him dearly.  ❤️
The rich need to give way more and not for some political scam!
My sister husband was dying of cancer and she hung her self xx
I miss my grandfather. He battled pancreatic cancer for a year. He was the strongest man I knew and went weak within a few months of treatment. He got me into guitar around 11-12 years old and im about done with highschool now and I still play every day. I think about him when I practice or just noodle around and it helps me keep my mind off negative thoughts. I hope there is a cure out there, and if there is I hope we find it and give it to everyone on the planet.  You are really speaking truth in your music Tom. I hope you make a bigger difference in this world than we can imagine.
Stage 4 Melanoma survivor.  And yes, sometime the treatment feels harder on your body than the cancer does.  I am 5 years out with no evidence of cancer now and the thought of reoccurrence is still in the back of my head every day.  Thank you for this Tom.
Amazing! Love you brother.
I can't say it would work for everyone, but research the Rife machine. There's a reason it's illegal for doctor's to use it, it would be so cheap to heal cancer patients. My Dad cleared out his cancer in just a few months. They are expensive but effective, so just know that there's hope out there.
Cancer sucks, and so many peoole have to deal with it. Thank you for shining a light on it, my moms husaband got cancer but he made it luckily.  Be a fighter, be a survivor.👍
Really love this song! I was diagnosed with leukemia 6 months ago and had to spend 3 months in the hospital.  4 rounds of chemo later I am in full remission. I am very lucky and will remember it for the rest of my life!
Play this for your doctor when they tell you the news
This song hits home hard.    My sister was passed away from breast cancer on November 19, 2020,.  She was dx with a very rare very aggressive breast cancer.  She was DX on her husbands birthday March 25 2020.   I will always love you and remember you, may you rest in peace Crystal Garcia.
Damn, that's a rough video to get through. Even for someone not going through any related struggle.
Lost it........”You Burn brighter in the dark”  Thank you for your fresh breath of intellectual thought.
Tom man, dang bro.... I've already listened to this 3 times. Cried all 3 times. I've lost 3 grand parents and an aunt to cancer. Really hit home. Beautiful song. Also absolutely love your song church. Huge respect to you and nova!!! Love you both!!!
Thank you for this. We have all known someone who has had this or does have this. All sides lose. Understanding of pain is what people need.
I'm 60 yrs old use to hate tap but you have given me a new love Thank you Tom and Nova
i beat 2 cancers ..bone n blood ..2 months too live here i am 5 yrs later just in time too feel n hear n see what i needed in my life
Thank you Tom MacDonald for being out there for us and i can only hope to return you a favour
Tears man😢....18 december 2020... diagnosed C... still battling ....🙏🙏🙏🙏tom...your music helps in my dark hours... thx
Grandmas had cancer twice and so did my mom, if its destined for my genetics to get it, atleast I know I have the genetics to beat it too.
Awesome song,  I've lost my share of family members to cancer including my husband, the kids dad to lung cancer and Lou Gehrig's disease.
After 11 years of fighting stage 4 and over 1 mil in costs. I am thankful for everyday,and I am thankful for you bro.
How many rappers would give a second to a subject like cancer? Not one. Thank you Tom Macdonald .....Thank you.
"Don't give up I know you're strong" hit me. Thank u tom😌
I just want to know who the 3.3k people are who disliked a song about cancer for God's sake.   This song is touching so many people. Not to mention, Tom's talent. He executed it perfectly. Thank you Tom for being someone who is committed to helping all kinds of people and all kinds of struggles. God put you here for a reason! There is no one like you. So run with it ❤
https://youtu.be/mDbY8ltyPFQ  This guy raps truth Better than Tom . Prove me wrong
Damn u speak the truth ,,, I am a cancer survivor but lost my mom and family to cancer ,,,thank u for this song,,,much love.
Cancer treatment is very profitable and common treatments may extend lives, but they also destroy individual immune systems.
I love you so much Tom thank you for always hitting my heart and soul 💯🔥
Best rapper I have ever heard!
I have no clue how to be able to have a personal conversation with you, but if you see this, give me a few minutes of your time please sir. Influencing people is what I do best too! If you’re willing to team up with someone who’s not worried about fame or status, and just trying to change lives....let’s make it happen! Either way....I’ll still love what you’re doing!!!
Kill cancer by starving it, don't eat any carbs or sugars. Proteins and fats only.
🥺🥺🥺 Tom brings the Truth
Go to God cone to Christ you’ll know where you’re going Eternity with our Lord🙏🏻
It's amazing my granddaughter my newest one was born on the same day that my father died I think that's great 1 ended + 1 began
Powerful song! I have had cancer went through all the treatments and I thank God for a miracle of healing!
H.O.P.E.    He Offers Peace Everlasting. I pray  for the Holly Spirit comfort all those in pain . A pain Jesus is familiar with. Stay strong brothers and sisters in Christ .
THE CANCER INDUSTRY DOES NOT CARE ITS A BIG LIE...  they are taking and taking and taking money and occasionally they give a few feel good survivor stories of cancer ( ONLY TO KEEP YOUR MONEY COMING IN)  if cancer is gone then BIG PHARMA  and  BIG GOVERNEMT and  PRIVATE INDUSTRIES  stop making BILLIONS AND BILLIONS and BILLIONS!!!!  So you see there will NEVER be a CURE for CANCER.  Thank you Tom for another great song
Sent this to my niece (under 30 years old) for inspiration for the stomach cancer she has. Three times fighting it, this time she lost her hair and her boys and stepdad shaved their heads alongside her. She's tough and a great mom, praying for her every day....Thanks for the songs...
I know this song is about cancer but the chours just hits hard cause im mentally struggling
Tell you what, I've only listened to KLOVE and Christian music for almost 5 years, shutting out the destruction of today's music sickness but you Tom and Nova have a calling. Dear Jesus I pray your hedge of protection around your truth tellers. Cried hard on this one. Thank you for not giving up!
I’m a 40 year old man, and I’m crying like a baby ha! Good stuff brother!
I watched my mom live with bone marrow cancer for 10 years. She made me swear not to my brothers what she was dyeing from. Bro that was the worst 10 years of my life
My dad died in 2015 at 51 years old. I live this song and cant relate
Amazing
i have ALS and there are ZERO treatments and 0% survival rate BUT there is a CURE discovered in 2008 and despite the proven success the FDA wont approve. the covid vaccine was discovered and approved in less than a year, and the survival rate is 94%!  i guess ALS and cancer just arent political enough. im sure my baby will understand thats why she has to grow up without a mom.
My dad passed last Mar.26...he didn't even know he had it..went into hospital saying his rib was hurting really bad but he never hurt it.....  Turned out he had Cancer and it was terminal his rib hurt cuz it set into his bones. We were told he had 1 year, then 6 months. Due to Covid he couldn't stay at hospital and I couldn't even go see him since I live out of state and I'd have to quarantine. 5 days after he was released  from hospital he died. #F@CKCANCER F@CKCOVID  So sorry for all people that didn't make it out of 2020. RIP Pops we miss you.(M.A.C.)
Hey Tom, I showed my dad this video just now, he currently has cancer (although not terminal, thank god, yet he still has to go through chemo and such) and he isn't one to cry, however, he started to tear up during this video. Also my dad said he will buy your albums if you ever have any.
I lost the strongest person I knew almost 2 years ago 25 years of fighting. Now I forever have an angel at my side
I love you Tom!!! I am in love with your music!!! Please do more ghost story videos though!!! I have watched hundreds of ghost story videos before and I have never come across a story being told before that is so enticing and skin crawling...you have natural talent in story telling. Just keep being you though dude!!!❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for this❣️ This man is going to go far. Keep doing you brother💪🏻
Only heard of HangoverGang a week now. Playing catch-up and binge watching everything. Still wanting more and looking forward to what they bring to the future!
Cancer is just a word for most,but when you have to carry that world its heavy burden,,3 years cancer free here..Tom you just touched me so much with this song.keeping me alive
A year ago, I got my blood cancer diagnose. It was a relief and a pain at the same time, it had been hell for three weeks before that with blood levels through the floor. Worst time of my life but even having the doctor talking about stage four, out of four, I never gave up. I am still here, fighting and god damn I will never get tired. Thanks for this song, it reached the heart.
Now I See You Tom keep it up a 💯 times...you build the CHURCH Am happy to hear  the next chapter from you...👏👏
Thank you. This song means a lot being a survivor of that nasty cancer. The treatment has left me in pain for the rest of my life and some physical disability also but I won't let it win and when I get down I will play this song. Thanks again
I wish that I had discovered you earlier. My cousin who to me is My Brother...Eric and I shared so many ups and downs in life as kids, during our time away as we both served in different branches of the military always had our love for music that kept us close. Eric would have loved exploring your music with me. Unfortunately, cancer took him this January after many years of fighting with a fire inside him that we all need to learn from. Thank you Tom...I don't know if you'll actually read this but man...this old rock n' roller, heavy metal, headbanger is digging your music and this song is going on Eric's memorial page for all of us that love him and miss him to see. Keep on Rollin'...
I have never been so moved by song. Thank you Tom. Thank you. God bless you.
#FACTS
This song...... I see it as your best work, I love you speak the truth I watched my grandma take her last breath at 7 years old due to breast cancer now I'm 29 and a month ago my mom was diagnosed with the same cancer and this song definitely helps......
Been fighting cancer since 2010 ,1 radiation treatment nearly killed me for 6 months, went on cbd and hemp supliment and am still alive! It sucks that I have to die legally or live illegally, just saying... Thank you for this song, I love you and Nova!!! 🥰🤗🙏🌹💯
This dude can move a mountain.
Is that the same couple from killing the neighbors?
This video makes me cry such an amazing message.
I'm still fighting, I needed to hear this. I'm so tired. Thank You.
I can say I never though a rap song would bring me to tears yet here I am. Tom you are such an inspirational artist, we lost our sister to glioblastoma in Jan 2019 and she was definitely a fighter and I miss her so damn much. And as usual everything you said is correct. Hugs and love to you guys
Keep singing the truth tom
I lost my pops 5 yrs ago in 2020. He fought one hell of a fight! Thank you Tom!
Speaks to so many. #CancerSucks
Thank you for bringing back music that means something... I lost my mom to cancer 13 years ago and it still hurts. Your music has been a beacon shining light on the truths people don't like to speak on. Keep making lirics that induce feelings in a numb world.
They don’t cure cancer because then overpopulation will boost
Please tell your mom thank you for  sharing you with us. She deserves a golden crown. She out did herself raising you with such a beautiful soul
They have a cure for Cancer.  300-500k htz.
From a 3x Cancer survivor I can't thank you enough for this amazing song.
This hits home. I lost both parents and friends to cancer
I'm 64 years old and never liked rap but ran across Tom by accident. So Tom MacDonald I think your an AMAZING GENIUS and THE REAL DEAL! Thank you for your honesty in your songs.
"Nothing matters if you don't have your health, all the money in the world doesn't help"  PREACH THAT
Fuck big Pharma, anyone who harms others with the money making is hell bound
I LITERALLY cried listening to the real you spit in this one.. The system is destroying humanity and we pay it to continue to do so..Ppl worried about created race wars, manufactured viruses, false flag shootings, party affiliation, rights ETC. We need to be united & take down the system causing these issues. Humanity is at a breaking point.
@2:30  are some of the most powerful  lyrics I’ve ever heard.
Hey. Guys. Btw the cure exists! It is. But you have, as I had give up on their lies. I know that someone knows.. oh. Many people know how to cure it. It's with the plants, with old ways of being human.  Man I have more to talk and give you here, there is no end. Believe me. I love you. And thank you so much Tom! You make me feel so proud of being me, cuz I do speak the truth and it offends soo, so, soo much the people. And man. It's a fight. Emotional one. So lot of love from me, here from Romania. We, I love all of you good souls, harsh experiences don't have to make us harsh. Just keep believing in your own being that what can others say.. don't have to be the end truth. Love you.
1st time hearing this song my mom had to be held like a child from the car due to chemo radiation....we found out 2 yrs ago we have a cancer gene called lynche syndrome. Otherwise known as family cancer gene they've only discovered it about 13 years ago when my aunt went in because she was getting pain in her intestines large intestine... So five out of seven family members got tested and five of us have this cancer Gene I've had a hysterectomy my mom has a ileostomy bag I had all my female reproductive organs removed so I'm in complete menopause at 40 my aunt who discovered it had two pieces of her large intestine taken out my cousin was 30 and his hunting team put up the money to pay for his hospitalization and his colon cancer Bill's my brother had polyps and here we are now just waiting for more family members to get checked out
Lost my Brother who was my hero crazy to watch heart goes piece by piece his insurance wouldn’t pay for treatment until to late 🙏🙏 he was playing his guitar up to end now all my brothers are singing together again thank you for your voice for your music for your honesty for your talents it is much appreciated and heartfelt thank you for being you God bless the truth hurts there has to be a cure yet money keeps it down keeps it hidden except for the very elite that can afford I guess who knows ??keep bringing us your amazing talent much needed 🎼🙏🇺🇸
😢😢😢😢 I'm a year into the fight..,the only thing worse and more debilitating than cancer is the treatment.. ,and losing the time waiting to see if you'll have time to live later,,,, I chose to live now and stop wasting it holding my breath, as I will have all the time to wait when it wins....:-)
Tom, that was beautiful.  I'm one of the lucky survivors. But sometimes living doesn't always mean surviving. ✌
I wish youtube had a "Love" button.
This song is beautiful. You are an amazing person.
Thank you Tom!  My mom died of cancer but was such a fighter!!! This song !   I am speechless!  This song!!
Lost my dad to brain cancer 5 years ago. Tom, God bless you. Yes, your song made me miss my dad, but my dad embodied all your words in this song. I'm proud of him. I know I'll a him again. I have to. Thanks again for all you do.
Thank You
You brought me to tears .Been taking my friend of 36 years to chemo. It's all true. and thank you. Please guys get your colonoscopy it's killing me to watch my friend die don't do it to yours .

😍
😭😭😭
You are so amazing Tom. I don’t know of any other musician that has written a song about cancer. But if they have, yours is the best. God bless you and nova 🙏🏼love from 🇦🇺.
My mother lived for 10 years with bone morrow cancer. Till she gave up.
we need more ppl like him in this world
I am just hearing this. It hit me evening harder then your new song Church. I just had a Total Thyroidectomy surgery to remove my thyroid. I just found out I had Thyroid Cancer. They got all of the Thyroid gland but I am not 100% in the clear. I have to have checkups every 3 months for next year to make sure it didn't spread anyway else in my neck.
Good on you! The cancer industry is a criminal, profit based industry with absolutely no desire to fix it. Its my pet peeve that people fundraise and donate money to these corrupt assholes after they lose someone they love. If only they knew that money would never help a soul.
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
I had my second of 25 radiation treatments this morning.   But I do know where I’m going. I trusted in Jesus. He was perfect, yet he took on my sins. He took my punishment, and gave me his righteousness.   Thanks for the song man.
Thank you for this song. So much truth. Keeping up the fight ❤
They already have a cure... they keep it from people they have a cure for everything even dmt is known to cure cancer but that’s illegal look into plant medicine. He’s not fully awake. They’re 10,000 years above us in technology but hold it from us. And try speaking about how our food and vaccines and water causes cancer
There is something after.  I’ve been there, I promise.
"And you dont know what you can take, until you realize, that you didn't break..."  That reminded me of my thoughts in Marine Corps bootcamp...all the time I'm thinking..."why the hell am I doing this to myself...I dont want to do this crap..." and then...its honestly over before you know it...and you're like...well hell, that wasn't so bad...
Honestly cancer horrible i know and I know I will bevhated for it but if disease and cancer never existed our world would be so overpopulated and people may suffer from starvation or any other situation. I lost my grandfather to cancer so i know the pain but I also despise the medical field that can but will not make a true cure . but understand all sicknesses have a purpose even if it does cause pain and death. But thank you tom this song does bring light to the darkness
Stop freaking saying we don't where we go! You are putting people in the dark McDonald!!!!!
We know where we go when we died. I promise all of you. I died from a car fentanyl overdose 9 months ago and was considered clinically dead and they could not start my heart and I had so much oxygen taken from my brain that they said I would be brain dead and some buddy from a Catholic Church came in there and blessed me and they said I had a guardian angel but I never figured out who this guy was. I had a near death experience and ever since my life has changed and I have been baptized and I can promise anyone that's feeling down right now that there's no such thing as hell. How is a form of mind that people can choose to live in or that other people can tell them to live in. What I died I was taken through valleys and galaxies of rivers of swirling Stars with a girl with blue hair and a white flowing dress. at the very end I could imagine this probably lasted a few seconds I was met by a being made of light with no face and nothing was said but supposedly I woke up after that
So True Tom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! XOXOXO
Cancer cannot live in a body with a basic ph balance. It thrives in a body with an acidic ph, and oxygen deprived.
Tom I want to say Thank you for this Song My Dad Passed away in 2011 from Cancer and My mom Just passed away Yesterday morning from it me and my sibling love your music and this song will be one to get me threw this hard time.
thegreatawaking is coming they cant stop it anymore!!!
Tom I’m battling Head & Neck cancer 38 rounds of radiation left me with no saliva glands just sucks Brother, thank you for this ! Your a good man doing great things giving great messages
ALLSTAR Tom MacDonald the Educator.
Know a couple my self brother
This song hits home with me. My dad lost his battle with cancer December 7, 2020😔😔 him and my mom met on a blind date and were married for 58 years. We miss him every day. Most people are aware they have a cure for cancer and just about everything else but there's zero money to be made curing diseases. So instead they fill you with poisonous unnecessary medication the side effects are sometimes worse than the disease itself. Disgusting.
I've avoided this song. This one hurts and pisses me off. My youngest child lost his father to cancer. They have the cure. The cure doesn't make money. It does cause absolute heartache.
My dad died of cancer in 03 after a few months I turned 13. He was 52. R.I.P to those who passed from this terrible deal and god bless to the loved ones who lost those from it.
Thank you so much for your boldness to speak truth when so many are afraid to. This definitely hit home. Lost my mom to cancer last year, definitely one of hardest things I’ve had to go through. Great song and love your music.
I come from a family of fighters.  We will fight anyone, anywhere . Even cancer.   My sister passed away at 53 from stage 4 colon cancer.  She did what all of us Ecklers do.  She fought and fought hard.  At the end,at her last breath, she said " I'm still here"   🤒❤🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀
He writes with true emotion
Thank you. For those of effected by it in many ways really does help.
Hard to fight the tears watching this video... We are so poisoned … they become rich.... sick world of demons.
Thank you for this beautiful song! 8 yrs cancer free!!! I am a fighter!! I just thought the same thing...why haven't they cured cancer yet!!!?💜
MMS
This song really touches me oh, I just lost my children's father because of cancer and they lost their dad.
The water, the pharmaceuticals , vaccines , the Monsanto GMO , agent Orange, Monsanto and Bayer pesticides.. it all contributes to rising rates of cancer that the pharmaceutical industry gets rich off of. Now Bill Gates wants to own all the seeds by using patents. People need to start growing their own food and living off the land more. The corporate farming is tied into these big pesticide and GMO companies. Meanwhile,  natural medicine doctors were being found dead in 2019.
100% of the people born today will eventually die! Let's try to make the most and best of it while we're here...
As of last month, I'm twenty years a survivor from my diagnosis. My son turns 20 next month. Every bit I fought was worth it.  No one told me rap would make a grown man cry. If you're fighting, find something to keep fighting for.
My goodness! Thank you Tom
I've just been diagnosed and I can't tell you what this song means to me💗
Song helps me get thru these days, my mom was diagnosed and I was informed on Christmas eve. She almost didn't make it thru chemo and radiation, and ended up with second and third degree burns, from these radiation. She almost didn't make it thru the treatment, we won't know if it worked till mid April, but mom informed me if it didn't work, she will not be going thru it again. I'm not ready to loose my mom. Already lost dad from sclerosis, from liquor, showed up after he quit drinking.
You’re right. There is no incentive for pharma,, hospitals and charities to cure cancer. Such a shame. I have an uncle and aunt both suffering with cancer right now.
Beautiful! 😭
Man your music is insane can't wait to finish seeing what other art you have to share
You are a presentaion hero for cancer patients everywhere. I respect you Tom. I am a hospice nurse and everything you said is spot on.
HOW TF does this have 3.3k down votes?!!!
I had cancer in 2018.  I lost too many loved ones to cancer.  Thank you for this.  ❤
Who the hell is down voting this? Do they not have a heart? F those losers.
From an old lady who worked in the medical field for many years, the sad truth is there is no money in a cure...all of the money is in the treatment.   The rich get richer.  Thank you for drawing attention to this.
My mom died of cancer in.  2017, I have it now 2021 I am a fighter. God will take me home when he is ready I am not afraid.
I once had a friend who worked her ass off in school, and was researching cancer cures back in the early 2000s.  She died at 29.... from cancer.  Lost so many extended family from it, the future doesn't look good.
I’M NOT GIVING UP!!!😩
Thank You so much for this! My boyfriend of 12 yrs, Mark, is a huge fan of yours and he asked me to watch this as I will be a three year Breast Cancer Survivor in October of this year. I'm sitting in my living room, alone, bawling my eyes out. I knew I couldn't watch this with anyone looking at me.  So much truth in this song. The scene with the clippers hit me hard. When the time came to do the same to my head, I made Mark do it.  That act of Love hit him harder than I ever realized it could. And, that's when it fully hit me...my sickness is affecting everyone around me.  I turned my grief, and loss of body parts, into a learning experience by writing my journey down. I ,now, use my experience in hopes of teaching others how to survive it.  All I can say is Thank You!
My ex has cancer. She's literally hanging on by a thread.... I know she's my ex but I still love her. This song hits hard..... 😔💔
Thank you Tom for making this. I was diagnosed with stage4 cancer when I was 21 and being told you have cancer was really like the scene with the young lady. The screaming and yelling knowing there was nothing I could do to make it go away. The scene that really hit me was seeing all the stuffed animals appear in the room. That was like exactly waht happened when my "friends" would show up and bring me an stuffed animal, and it mad me so sad because I knew they were going back to their normal life having to deal with me (death) for ten minutes. All the times I was told I was going to die from doctors, I couldn't tell you because it all blended together. I did three years straight of chemo with no breaks. I went from 200 pound man to an 85 pound skeleton at my worst. And the insurance that i paid for everyday, refused for me to go the best cancer hospital, cause that's what they do. I fought and survived. 15 years later, despite my doctors telling me I would never be able to complete it, I attended the police academy and passed the PT, fighting the pain from my body. I graduated the police academy top of my class and now do everything i can to give back to my community. Now I have the world hate me for the badge on my chest, but that's ok because I know who I am and I'm happy there are still people who know most of us give everything.
Just found your music through Tatum. Thank you. Stage III endurer. You don't beat cancer, you just survive it with empty hands. It drains you of everything.
You are a special kind of talent Tom this song will give u a real reality check keep your message going u are helping so many even if u don’t know it
I held my mother-in-laws hand as she took her last breath. She had ovarian cancer.
My brother Bobby died at the young age of 7 years old and I was only 6 years old. He died from brain cancer. i miss him so much still and I know I will see him again in Heaven. I pray someday, if you haven't done it yet, that you and whoever reads this would accept Christ into their lives. Not only so they know where they are going to when they die, but also to know Jesus loved them even before they were born. He died a worse death than even a cancer patient because He died with all the sin of every human that ever did and ever will live on Him...that is why our Heavenly Father couldn't look upon His Only Begotten Son when the sin of all mankind was put upon Him. It's getting close to Easter or Resurrection Day, Jesus didn't live or die or go to Heaven in vain! I hope that brings solace to people and they accept Him now.
if they fix it they will not make any more $$$ so the low and doc are the devil
I got diagnosed with breast cancer last week. Wish me luck .....
Sadly it is ALL part of the system!! They (the doctors) probably have cures for most types of cancer but you will never hear about it, because they would lose money if somebody "cured cancer"!! I am a car guy, for example, and they (scientists) have learned how to make a car that runs on water! .........................Think about it for a moment..........................  If suddenly every car ran on water it would put the oil companies out of business from making gasoline. And because water is EVERYWHERE on our planet, the cars running on water would be filled for free meaning Governments would lose billions in taxes every year for stuff they don't make, they don't sell and they don't even produce!!! Cancer sadly is the same way!!   Cure Cancer and you remove the money, make a car that runs on water and the "people who get rich" lose money from it!! "Always follow the money"............ great words from a great man.......................................that man Rush Limbaugh!!
For my son. First diagnosis Father’s Day 2018. Relapsed in his testicles 2020. 31 days of coma. “When you’re tired you hold on baby. #jakestrong
Tom Keep it 100 bruh your the only Artist that has had the guts to do what you want and make it 1000% get work keep it up you and the Wifey
Doctors don't care about their patients. All they care about is the money. They know the cure for cancer. They found it many years ago. But they canceled the true cure because there wasn't any money in that.
Damn Tom,  makin a grown as man tear up...ok maybe full blown cry 😢
Yes. Damn right I fought harder and burned brighter in the dark. Survived it twice. I am not ready to leave this life. All I want now is a car to drive anywhere I’d like and travel to visit my friends and family who live all over  the USA. That’s my only wish now.  I just turned 51. I’m ready to go adventuring.
Stop vaccines! They ain’t like they used to be with all the Mercury and aborted baby cells and  formaldehyde contained!
Losing my grandma to melanoma this song hits super hard. Watching her fight wasn't easy seeing her at the end was even harder.
The bullshit industry of "raising awareness" for cancer? Who isn't aware of cancer, and why does "awareness" equal dollars? In 2012, the CEO of the Susan G. Komen "foundation had a salary of $684k.
@Tom MacDonald The first song of you i don't agree. I thing it's mostly sugar and other processed food, and much better Diagnosticts... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNzQ_sLGIuA
🙏Tom god bless yr soul n yr truth🙏
Tom is saying your will to live is a huge factor to living just a little longer . dont give in stay strong and show the doctor that will is stronger that meds
CANNABIS OIL CURES CANCER-
So good Tom....Thank you 🤛
My mom works for Hope 4 cancer and there all natural no radiation and they have a high success rate but the pharmaceutical companies keep it from becoming legal in the USA. Insurance won’t cover cause it’s out of the country and it kills her when people can’t afford it and they have to do radiation
Thanks for this song 🎵 im fighting stage 3 lung cancer. I pray every night that God will take the pain away.its always a blessing to know that are people like you whom cares .thanks your one of my heroes
Truest song ive ever heard. You'll always be in my heart with me grandma. I told you in your last moments I didn't know how I'd do it without you but not to worry and that I'd be ok, and here I am a year and a half later with the same job I got 2 months after you passed, a car I am about to own, my own place in my name, bills in my name, decent credit, a good man, no legal trouble, and most of all, still sober. You helped me get sober 5 and a half years ago. I love you grandma. You helped me get where I am today, and the reason I'm still alive. Cancer may have taken you from this earth but nothing will take you from me. 08/28/2019 🎗️  She never smoked, drank, or did drugs. She ate very healthy, worked out and had a job until the weeks of her passing. That shows no matter your health or life style cancer is everywhere, in our genetics, in the environment, in our food and water. She was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer July 16th 2019, passed August 28, 2019, only 6 weeks later... The last year before diagnosed only noticed fatigue and slight diahhrea  once in a while. Before that was completely healthy. 88 years old working and excersing.
I made it through a stage 4 diagnosis. This song is THE anthem!
Thank you
Amen...and now there are cures...natural ones!!!
How can 3.3k not like this? I'm gonna chop it up to insanity.
anybody who disliked this isnt going to have a good afterlife
This is why we need Medicare 4 All
My granny died May of last year due to brain cancer. I moved her into my home when my uncle and mom wanted to put her in a nursing home (right at the beginning of Covid) it was the hardest few months of my life and I sat by her bed her last week of life. She was in a coma for 8-9 days. She waited for me to leave the room the morning she passed. I was gone for just a few minutes. My granny was my best friend and my mom. I miss her every day 😭
I'm a 7 Year Cancer Survivor #February2015 ⚘THANK YOU TM⚘
Tom has touch so many people makes me cry just thinking about it!
Can't get enough! Tears in Rain at 1:39 a.m.
So heart felt💕
This is sad for this little girl I feel bad for her perents
My mom recently beat colon cancer but it was really close. We almost lost her. This song brought tears to my eyes! So great!
Holy fuck... as a cancer survivor this... this song kinda fucks me up. I think it triggered PTSD i didn't know i had... And somehow helps me through it at the same time.
Thank you my friend from a 4x fighter and still winning there's more than horrible big pharma out there just ask
God bless you Mr McDonald
Lost my father,  my grandfather and my father in law to cancer, it's an  insidious killer, but the " treatment " cruelly rob them of their dignity and will to live. I blame the greed of doctors and the kickbacks from big pharma for giving them false hope and robbing them of their quality of life in the end. Thank you Tom for always being so honest in your message and giving a voice to so many.
This goes hard I love it made me cry and I miss my Grandmother !!! 💔
This song would have millions more views if it didn't make the viewer cry every time. Hard to watch on the regular but we see you, Tom. Just found you and your music a week ago. It was exactly what I needed. Thank you for reminding me who I am amongst the chaos. Keep it up, brother.
Why would anyone give this a thumbs down???? Really? Great job
"We  are dying to keep living!" Woah, the whole song is deep but that one line resonates. Keep up the fight Tom, you are a voice in the dark, leading to the light!
Ok. I watched. I'm bawling now. I am tired. I am not a fighter. I didn't ask for this fight.
Stage 3b Breast Cancer survivor who just had yet another shitty birthday. I cannot watch this and have been avoiding it since I first saw the thumbnail. I am most certain it will bring me to more tears. Love you and Nova's work and energy. ~Love to all
Thanks for being real! Much Love!
Yeah lost a brother at 20 (still fucks me around) now my neighbour (sweetheart) just found out he has the 2 deadliest forms of cancer...😢😢..starts chemo soon..
GRAMMY WINNING SONG
😢😢
Tom, I love your music but I think this is my favorite song. Like so many others, it is personal to me because my father has stage 4 Renal Cell Carcinoma. Thank you for writing this!
That was a good one brother one of my favorites
I'm sorry or not here  Dad Just know will always love you thanks for this song tom Donald  It really touched my heart
❤️
Tom this song is soo good man. great job bro  love this song
What a touching song! Everyone has been touched by cancer in some way!
Thank you Tom. I’ve avoided this video because I lost my sweet Mama on 04/13/20 to cancer. The industry just left her to die and I will never forgive them or stop fighting for the cure, because we know they have the cure. Makes me pause and wonder. My Mama had fought 5 different cancers in her lifetime starting at age 27 and yet none of her children or grandchildren have the “gene” makes one think way too hard.
It's the emotion in his face that makes me love this song. I can feel how he feels in this. That's art.
Everything that doctors are taught, are controlled by the elite, they want us to be on the verge of death, raking the money in, by giving us pills, and drugs, with all sorts of effects.  You can prevent, and reverse cancer, with a whole food, plant based diet, there’s no need for any sort of radiation, all the processed food, have so many chemicals inside them, slowly making us ill, it’s all been a plan.   Please, don’t take my word for it, watch What The Health, on Netflix, it explains how food, causes so many diseases.  Tom MacDonald, you truly are a hero, for speaking the truth, I’m really supporting, everything you’re doing.
Thank you. I was diagnosed last February. Life has pretty much sucked since that night they told me.
Discovered you at fake woke. I get im late to your story. But im here now. Loved your last drop. The rock anthem was awesome. But this one got me. I know because of my job cancer is whats gonna get me. You can say the words but meaning the words makes it a whole new thing. I hope you see this. Keep up brother
I just lost my Aunt Sandy last Wednesday to cancer and I cant say how much these songs mean to me and my loved ones
I was There When my Mother  took Her LAST Breath. Way too young at 60. Smoking kills... Smoking Methnols kills you a lot faster.
Damn I cried when I heard this brought me back from when my grandma battled cancer
Tom keep being you keep helping others with your words. Thank you for using your talents for something meaningful. Not just grass ass or cash like the rest of em. Keep on keeping on  tom realist rapper alive
Thank you. 💜💜  My mom got cancer when I was 13 years old. She died when I was 16.  That was back in 1984. And we are still here. Still trying to figure it out.
Fuck the 3.3k people who just hate a person even though they have never heard his messages.
I love this song i lost my mumma to cancer 2yrs ago R.I.P MUMMA
beautifull!
He sounds like Blink 182 when signing.
My daughter beat the s*#t outta neuroblastoma stage 4 in 2008. I get choked up thinking bout it.  I can’t stand hip-hop rap or whatever you call it but this song is great & lifts spirits in me. I saw over 20 lil kids 2-4 years old die in the hospital & threatened my kid that I’ll take ppl out & die too. Thank the Gods she made it and we’re both happy to be alive
I  survived cancer this year! Just on time., extremely agressive cancer cells  where in the tumors  It was hard because im a mom of 6 kids.. And yes i was so afraid to die and had to leave my kids... I had 2 surgerys and  few times in hospital  that ugly diagnose is gone for now.. I still have a tumor in my lung but there's no agressive cells in it..  You must be a fighter to handle  all this....keep your head up amd keep going pray for the best and never give up!! Im so lucky i am so so very grateful...
Lost my dad to cancer. May he R.I.P. 3/31/19
FCKN...BEAUTIFUL...TRACK
Great song my dad is about to die from the damage chemo did beat cancer 2 times 3rd unfortunately is doing it god bless
On my dad is about to start
One of the most powerful songs in a long time. I actually cried when I heard it
Spot On AGAIN Brother. Of course they have “the cure”! Modern day eugenics. 🤬 its the EXACT same with treating pain! Are ya tryin to tell me with DECADES AND BILLIONS spent “the best option” is still narcotics?!?! Pfffffffffft. Modern day day eugenics 🤬 Dope Trac. Ty for all you do and the #TruthYo ya spittin..... its Tom McDonald, Bitch🔥✌🏼❤️💛💚
Thank you for all the truth you are not afraid to get out. You're truly a great inspiration of truth in a time full of smoke and mirrors.
This song about cancer and the fight is just like the fight us Type 1 diabetics go through on the daily. Love the song Tom! Much love to those that have and lost loved ones to cancer.
I always have said,"That we live to die and we die to live".
Wow! What an amazing song. Every word of it is so true.
In April of 1998 my 64 year old grandfather Robert Shaughnessy lost his battle to lung cancer. He was mere months away from turning 65. A Korean war veteran who worked hard to support his family.  I was just shy of 4 years old when he passed.  I was robbed of a chance to know him by cancer.  Cancer sucks I hope we can eventually cure it.
Choose love  My heart to yours
Damn tom u made me cry
My wife just beat breast cancer, this song is an amazing anthem
Thank you honestly thank you
You're right.. Everything you say.   When time comes for a revolution I wish I had someone like you to stand by..  You're very smart and inspiring. Thank you for sharing your work.
3 time cancer survivor right like frigging hell,,God bless eveyone
Ik something rattle snake venom
Dammit... I lost my mom at 15 day before mother's day...breast cancer....lost my dad in 2014 from stomach cancer (agent orange from vietnam).... I'm 35 with a 6 month old daughter and I look at her and hope to god I never have to put her what I went through losing my parents.   From the bottom of my heart, thank you for this song. I've been waiting for one like this for years. You are a true artist. Be safe and I wish you and Nova the best.
Real meaning bro thank u for all ur music I got 6 years to live but this gives me a better perception
I have cancer so thank u for this
I'm at the Cancer center now Ty 💯💞
This guy has real talent, speaks the truth, and isn't an idiot immoral piece of rubbish like most mumble rappers, trying to spread their poison to our minds.
Today's Mom's birthday, I lost her 25 years ago to this evil. For the first time I posted something that gives true hope for those struggling...thank you...
❤️😢
cancer is a lie, just as AIDS is a lie...and of course the Corona virus is a lie...all lies to keep us in fear, to profit in billions and to kill us in millions (thats exactly what the chemo will do...not the cancer, but the therapy). check out Dr. med. Ryke Geerd Hamer's "German New Medicine", then you will understand that the body doesnt make dumb shit, cancer is just a biological meaningful response which was triggered by a shock in the psychie....nobody needs to die of cancer. https://learninggnm.com/home.html
Every fight song is hard for me. I survived, but I lost my grandma and my cousin to it just a couple of years ago. I’m a fighter, but it breaks my heart knowing they fought a batter that overtook them in the end
I wish I seen this before my sister lost her battle to cancer. I wish I could have shown her this video or at least hear this song. I wish I encourage her more that she was a fighter. She was a fighter!!!!! Everyone else gave up an told her to give up. As soon as she gave up she was gone. March 3rd 2021 at 36yrs old Kimberly Placke gained her wings way too soon.
Nothing you produce is bad, Tom. Goodness, you're anointed with a purpose so strong!! Thank you for making your art!
These lyrics. Omg. They hit me. Hard.
Dude... Ouch. That was hard to watch.
My daddy passed away from pneumonia from his chemo. He died from the treatment. RIP My sweet Daddy
This is scary true. Went through treatment... then was told the treatment was going to kill me in 5 years. They are poisoning us. It's everywhere.
Wow. Powerful.
Cancer has taken 2 of the most closest people to me my Papa and my gran watched Papa die at 2 then watch my gran fight it for 26 years then she lost.. They both died in their 50s. I told my gran alot of the lines in this song before i knew it existed. Tom your our voice in this generation we love you
Only sinners go to heaven, bro.  God doesn't reward salvation for being "good".  The truth is you can't be good enough.  Instead, you get grace if you want it.  It's a get out of jail free card, and all you have to do is take it.  Then by the grace of God, you'll be a different person, continually being sanctified by God until you die.  Plenty of bad people will get into the new heavens and earth with their coat tails on fire (so to speak).  I'm one of them.
Thank you bro. Im a survivor. I hope to never get it again but its a good possibility i will because of my genes. Nothing in this song was untrue because i do fear death but i will never stop fighting. Thank you again brother
How could anyone dislike this? Honestly...speechless.
Thank you. 5 years free from colorectal cancer. Thanks for caring. Your right they know the cure I'm sure of it. They all make more money this way.
My mom and dad beat cancer there beautiful miracles
Beautiful song mr  MacDonald
sh*t i cant stop crying...
I know cancer is a really hard thing to go through... My grandfather had it.  It was really hard, especially when I had to change his tracheotomy tubes... 😢😭 But I wish someone would write a song for multiple sclerosis... I have that and trigeminal neuralgia (the suicide disease) and sometimes I wish there was a song that made me feel heard...
My husband and I want to thank you for this song. He was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer last November. He got teary  eyed when he heard this song , he says he feels it’s for him. We listens to your songs everyday.
believe it or not most kids get cancer threw the shots there giving when they were kids,my aunt works for john Hopkins hosp.one of the best hosp.known! and this is one of the worst kept secret in the world!
most doctors are fake,dumb n currupt the whole fking system!
Imagine having cancer in America with No Health Care!  How would you fight it?
My grandma past away from it.
Nope. I thought I could make it through the whole video (bawling my eyes out, of course), but I had to peace out when that mother laid down in the bed with her daughter. I just can't do it.
My mom died of cancer...I was crying from the first line.  I've always disliked rap...until I heard Fake Woke.  Now I'm a fan.
And u won't know  y u have FAITH UNTIL U LOOK THE DEVIL IN HIS FACE...Deep....am a 2 time cancer survivor..2time in 10 yrs...!! Tht line in the song is SO TRUE!!! I tell people all the time...Cancer grounded me humbled me and reminded me that my faith had only gotten stronger 🙏...Thank you Tom
u speak the truth jesus is coming back soon  just repent people do good to others dont bad things i love your music your realistic
WOW! Preach it man! Fucking preach it!
This is a great song. We just found out my mom has cancer and this song is definitely an anthem for those fighting.
3k down votes? Wtf
I don’t know how you do it but every time I start to feel like my world is crashing and the light at the end of the tunnel is too far out of reach u give me a little hope to keep pushing forward and a little more strength to hold it together keep doing what u do Tom the world needs people like you
Thanks Tom , my Dad fought bone cancer for 6 hard years , he died 30 yrs ago ,and I cry everyday I miss him so ....
I lost both my parents to cancer..the most precious moment in my life was my son being born and to watch my mom and dad take there last breath. Feelings that you never feel again till it happens again. Stay strong people time heels your woundsvi promise. I'm living proof you will feel better.
Lost my dad to cancer on 9/30/20. Six months ago but it feels like yesterday. I’m stuck here in a deep, deep well of grief that I have absolutely no idea how to climb out of..... but, this song helps when I feel like giving up. My father was a fighter. He was a hero. He was my hero. #fuckcancer
billion in donations? Make that trillions
I lost one of the most beautiful women in my life about a year ago, heart , mind, soul. I lost my Grandmother which basically raised me and I have a hole in my heart to this day. fq cancer.
No money in cures....but  huge money in treatment....follow the money....do your own research....👊
this is a good emotional piece, i had a few friends with cancer.. i miss them.
Believe in Jesus. He saved our souls when he hung on the cross....tomorrow is not promised
Please research vitamin C in huge doses. Research alternative treatments in Mexico. Yes, the USA laws don't allow the cure. U need to get out of USA
"You don't know what you can take til you realize you didn't break" 💜💜💜 love that line, living it. Lost my son to terminal bone cancer in 2008, now fighting my own stage 4 leiomyosarcoma diagnosis. Was told that I had 50/50 chance to be here in a year.... 6.5 years ago. There have been struggles, especially this last go-around with radiation, that I thought I was done.  But, made it to the other side and pushing forward again. Stay strong everyone. Keep fighting!
My God some of these songs are soo real soo good absolute 🔥 hope we get this in the next 3 weeks just all real shit love it Tom.
I'd like to understand how 3k+ "People" can 👎 THIS song! Haters have no boundaries 🤦🏽‍♂️.
Whole foods plant based diet can prevent many types of cancer and increase survival.  Take care of yourselves everyone and stay positive.
No money in a cure
No money in the cute
Hey tom thank you foreal two weeks ago i had a gun in my mouth ready to rest but was convinced by your music to just wait a little longer and last night i got told i was getting 12 grand to get out of debt and go to med school to be a doctor and to save others as well as myself and i thank you a thousand times brother
The ordinary tuna finally complain because girl resultantly tick under a scientific clarinet. vast, extra-large extra-small exuberant lettuce
wrong video to start my morning  😢   Wish I could upvote this video more than once.!   Absolute Truth and Inspiration!
Bless 💞
My granddad saw your video and sad cool and that it was touching bcs he has cancer he found out 12 years ago the day I was born
Bro, as a hodgkins lymphoma survivor this hit all the way to home plate for me personally. I have just in the last year been exposed to your music and it's been  great ride. Love the effort, and commitment to you're craft.   Mad respect,  Adam
Thank you for this my husband is a cancer survivor of Hoptchkins lymphoma and my 6 year old niece is a survivor also plz keep em coming Realist ever love you and beautiful NOVA
The whole medical industry is Satan's most clever & highest achievement on this earth, destroying/enslaving humanity one life at a time under the guise of "health care".
Thank you Tom you're right about it all my mom passed away from cancer
My mother lost the fight she'd been fighting for two years this month. If there is a cure, and there are people who know it and are keeping it a secret for money..... I wish on every star, every moon and every passing second that they die in a fiery disaster.  That they feel every single inch of their skin blister and burn before they die!
Thanks man...a life long struggle. No cure, a guaranteed early death...but good God, I needed this just to see how much worse so many other cancer stricken people have it.  You're a blessing, Tom.
Truth
You truly amaze me, no matter what you do it's  💥💯🤯
I just lost my dad a month ago. Thank you for this.
Thank you my mom is a survivor
Thank you Thomas I am a cancer survivor...I am a Warrior...👊👊👊
Wow! Brand new fan and this hits close to home. THANK YOU. ❤
This song brought me to tears. Just left the funeral home from seeing a guy I went to school with. He died from cancer.
"You don't know what you can take, til you realize you didn't break"..... That quiet and profound section of the song just before the last chorus is as inspirational as it gets.
🤙
Damn I'm a 35 year old man who works in the oilfield and grew up in wyoming where men are still men and we don't cry often if at all and this song had me on the edge. I already knew you were different, but this song makes me respect you on an entirely different level.
I lost my dad to liver and bladder cancer 5 days ago. Thank you for this song Tom truly!
It's the system, it's a prison !!!! This really got me ugh so true.
My gosh I love this song tearjerker man this is me I'm a man I don't cry what are these mysterious wet drips coming from my eyes oh no it happened lol  I got to watch this again absolutely love it
The truth is, the "good" don't go to Heaven, only the forgiven.
I miss my dad.  This makes me 😭
There are 3.3k people who've never been loved, sad
More of this please!
PUSH CARDANO !  DECENTRALIZATION AND GOD SPEED !  THE SYSTEM MUST BE DESTROYED !  These are not people who serve the system. You know what has to be done.
WOW, That just hit the heart. Thank you for sharing.
First Time In A While That A Song Made Me Feel The Need To Cry. Tom You’re A Blessing Man. I’m 16 Years Old And Just Observe How Misguided And Sleep Some Folks Are.🥺 Love You Man😖🤍
I'm a metalhead but this dude is the best artist in A LONG TIME. I just ordered about 5 shirts. SUPPORT AND PROTECT HIM.
My husband is recovering from surgery to remove his kidney infested with cancer,they say we got it than just to say,it may have spread,if not,it can come back, we caught it early they say..if u get cancer,this is the kind you want,they say..why don't "they" stop saying and let us fight it! Thank you for speaking the truths that no one else has courage to say..maybe your truths will help us all to heal so we can help each other no matter who we are!
This is awesome
Currently fighting leukaemia and this song really hit hard. Thank you so much for this ♥️
Tom, you have a tremendous gift to tell other's story without knowing them. Thank you.
I have a feeling I am about to cry..... I lost my mom to cancer in 2015 and I still struggle today. She was an alcoholic and that contributed among other things to her liver and colon cancer. She fought hard and as a nurse I felt like I could take care of her at home because the doctor she had had for years while she worked in a damn hospital missed everything. I had a feeling something was wrong because she suddenly got this horrific nosebleed and I BEGGED them to check her liver and other things because I knew a problem with your liver could cause some of the symptoms she had. The jerk dismissed her complaints for YEARS of stomach pain, lack of appetite, and losing weight as her drinking problem. It was caught on a CT when her new doctor was concerned about her complaints. She had changed insurance (because her hospital job forced her to retire because her husband had been sick and as soon as he came home she got the nosebleed and they told her she missed too much work after she missed births of grandchildren for them) and that gave her actually the chance to see a better doctor. The original doctor also almost killed my stepdad who had a heart attack June 25th 2015 as well so he was just useless. I took care of my mom at home until the day I lost her. I had hospice here at nights after I got so rundown that I couldn't stay awake anymore and the last night of her life I was up every hour telling her I loved her and if she was hurting she could go...... That effectively ruined my nursing career though because I can't stand to see anyone else in the shape my mom was in.... Thank You Tom for making this song. I will now have a song I can listen to and think of her strength to keep fighting. RIP mom 12/24/51-08/28/15
Okay Tom. You're never allowed to make me cry again. It ruins my tough guy image. Like many of his songs, this one hits home. Hopefully this will give strength to those struggling with this disease, and their loved ones. Powerful.
God bless you Tom.  In the darkness, God sends lighthouses.
Leukemia.  1996 at 20 years old.  Turning 45 in two months.  True lyrics like always!
How ridiculously strong does your hate boner gotta be for someone to dislike their song about FINDING A CURE FOR CANCER?!
Another painful video to watch, because I lost my Mother and my Sister almost a month apart in 2015. Brought a tear to my eyes and I thank you for it!! Your lyrical talent touches more people than you know. Thank you again Tom.
Five years cancer free. I had my first child four months ago. ♥️
You're amazing
Cancer is like a chapter in the book of our genetic code, if you kill an HIV cell, and put a re-written version of that person's DNA minus the chapter on cancer in that dead HIV cell, then re-introduce that back in the person, it re-writes the DNA code of the person to eliminate cancer.  Look up genetic reprogramming to cure cancer and you see subjects 20 years later cancer free.
Thank you.  I'm still in treatment, Stage 4 lung cancer metastasized into liver, but I'm fighting and in remission right now! Great song.
Shit bro first song of yours to make my eyes water🥺😥Some real talk though.
I love u tom
Cancer is killing both my parents😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Look up Kanzius, he was a man in Sanibel Island that created a cancer cure.  He had end stage cancer at the time and died, but local hospitals were talking about piloting the treatments there.  Then nothing.... I think his family sold the rights and it was buried forever.  Too much money to be made on pharmaceutical treatments.  Notice they don’t cure anything, only treat symptoms, which cause side effects, then more meds to treat the side effects.
I cannot believe one person disliked this video, let alone over 3k.  What's wrong with humanity?  🤦🏼‍♀️
I love you mum.. I'm so sorry for how I am this guy is changing my life I promise
This makes my heart ache so much because I lost my dad to  throat cancer when I was seven years old fast forward to now seven years later and it still hurts a lot
Amen this one gave me chills.  I lost my mother to cancer at 15 in 73’ is sucks the life out of families. To know there’s a cure is sad because they don’t want to provide a cure to the money machine.  God bless you kid on your journey because your going places to scream our needs off that mountain top. Great job 👍🏼👍🏼
Mad respect man.
This song means a lot ... never heard of Tom before but listening to him now.... there’s something really wrong with the ppl who hit dislike this song..   Never give up!  Thank You Tom
My dad beat it twice, but probably lost to it in the end. We aren't sure, but damn if this doesn't hit hard.
♥️🧡💜 Thank you for keeping the discussion going💛💙💚
If there was a cure to cancer do you think the drug companies who sell the “delaying” treatments would want to put themselves out of business?  Saying this as someone who lost many to cancer - Pop (bone cancer), Nan (skin and lung cancer), Aunty (lung cancer).
Tom MacDonald man crazy gifted with music it helps so many people bro u dont even know much respect
The only song I can’t listen to without tearing up lost both grandmas from cancer
Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the life no one gets to the father except by him. All who call on the name of the Lord will be saved. Jesus speaking behold I stand at the door and knock. If we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive our sins.There is no remission of sins except by the blood of the lamb. If we ask the Lord Jesus Christ to forgive our sins, to be our Lord, to come Live in our Hart, to be our Lord and God we will be born again and heaven will be our home in the end, all who call on his name will be saved. The Lord ain’t willing that any should perish but all come to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. Amen 🙏
Never occurred to me until I heard this song and started thinking... When's the last time you've ever heard of a Mega mainstream celebrity dying from cancer? Or even HAVING cancer? Recently Rush Limbaugh, got rest his soul, died of lung cancer. But he wasn't exactly spreading the mainstream message. This is why I love Tom Macdonald!! Not only is his music honest, but it's thought provoking, at least to those who aren't brainwashed and programmed by the "progressive" radical left!
Deep
I’m not feeling the song .. lol  Idk if lyrics and beat just don’t match or what..  idk
Who are the 3k heartless losers that thumbs down this track? People are sick.
I have terminal stage 4 given 6 months to live today I celebrate 1000 days but the price I pay to live raidiation chemo hormone injections pure hell and the pain and up all night alone in pain.get tested please
Value and substance. Tugging song has what every song should have. I'm so impressed by this man and Nova.
I'm 8 month in remission from stage 4 colon cancer and I am only 28, I lost my job, ability to have children, body destroyed, I live in pain ans still have so much trouble, this song has spoken to me so much! Xoxo I love your music and family.  Never give up man, never!
My dad is currently dieing of bladder cancer and was give a death sentence he was told there is nothing they could do
Damn, I cried.
So beautiful.
Please keep telling truth, we have needed this for so long!  Positive Role Models!  Someone who is actually awake!
My grandfather, uncle, great aunt and countless others have died from cancer.
Tom McDonald just want to say thank you for writing the song definitely helps me through the hard times I'm going through cancer treatment for a second time definitely soothe my soul your awesome brother thank you I just want to say that cancer sucks
🙏I FEEL EVERY SINGLE WORD, HE IS SINGING. LOST MY WIFE TO CANCER 9YRS AGO...SHE GAVE ME A BLESSING FIRST DAUGHTER, MY ANGEL THAT KEEPS ME IN CHECK LOL. GOTTA KEEP STRONG 💪 CONTINUE FORWARD. GONE BUT NEVER FORGOTTEN
Not gonna lie trying to fight back tears. My grandmother passed away from cancer when I was 5. All I can remember is her hook up to breathing machine at my dad's. Cancer is such a hard pill to swallow. My last memory was seeing her doctor sitting out in living room. Telling her that she had two weeks tops. Last time I seen her I said I love you and I will see again. I never got to say goodbye.
Amazing music man! Keep it up! Lost my mom to cancer and it's pain nobody should have to experience
God damn one of the songs that made me cry.. my dad survived cancer twice I love this song this has to be my favorite song by tom so far
I've been saying that for a long time. My infusions were 20k a pop and the infusion centers were ALWAYS packed... business is good... they won't ever come up with a cure.
Why has this not blown up like the rest of his new stuff?
One love bro
Amazing
Thank you for this song. It has really helped me in my battle 💜
I'm a 3x Cancet survivor and this song truly hits home. Thank you for such amazing understanding
My Dad got dx with cancer. I found your music through this song. I have terminal crohns. (In remission) I come to this song to encourage myself. To remind myself I'm a fighter. Your lyrics touch my heart. Your songs have inspired me
God bless you and if you wonder if we are a cosmic accident or not,  check out the bombardier beetle that defies evolution and all the near death experiences people report.
I have stage 4 cancer and I'm at the very end. I cry a lot and I'm scared that every day will be my last day saying goodbye to the ones you love is the hardest thing in the world. Just like you said in this song it's scary not knowing where you're going to heaven or to hell.  I gave my best friend who is my German Shepherd Nova's last name because I think your girlfriend is awesome ❤️ This song made me cry because it's so true. 🤗❤️💯👍 I will keep fighting because it's who I am.
😢😢😢😢😢
Amen!
Funny how you can cure lung cancer and pancreatic cancer if one is a communist Supreme Court Justice.
Ouch.
I lost my dad to colon cancer. I do believe much of it is genetic but a lot is also from the poison that is put in our water, food, etc. All  many want to talk about is climate change but the same people are producing GMO food , the plastics they are put it in and filled with chemical flavorings. Many doctors I have seen say I am CRAZY for thinking that! Too much corruption for the all mighty dollar. I just don't trust any politician, doctor, government, etc.😡
❤❤
Good grief, how can 3,300-odd people dislike this song?! It has so much feeling and passion in it, so much intensity and meaning. Whether he's right about whether the cure is being withheld or not, that's not what I got from this song. It made me think of one of the people in my gaming group who is in her 60s and in remission from cancer (if memory serves, I'd have to ask her again about it), and her potentially being more vulnerable to the flu then the rest of us are is the biggest reason we're meeting online on Roll20. Whether we ever find a cure for it in our lifetime or not, this song has weight in the best way.
Just lost my mom to cancer this past September. Song definitely helps with the problem
Starting chemo tomorrow and I felt this song in my core! Definitely needed to hear this message! Thank you for this! 😢
I listen to this song everytime I feel down. I had cancer and currently going through chemo (3 sessions left 😊) and then radiation. Tonight's one of those nights that I just ask why. Cancer isn't in my family and doctors just can't tell me why they think I got it.  I want to thank you for this song, especially for the chorus. It really helps singing that part when nights are long.   A lot of blessings for you on your beautiful journey, you are making waves 😊
My Mom died to Cancer it was almost 4 years ago.. i miss her but i know she has it better now than when she had pain and wanted to die. Thank you for this amazing track tom 👏 Much Love from Germany ❤🇩🇪
This one hit dude.
My mom died of cancer in 93.   Someday I think of her a lot!  She was strong!!
man i never heard anything so real this is awsome
I dont know how this could get any dislikes. That's what is wrong with this world. Very beautiful and touching song. Very good lyrical content as always I freaking loved this. But it's very sad and true as well. RIP to all those who have been taken by cancer.♡
This man has mad me cry in a few songs more than I have in an entire lifetime.
Pretty amazing when you hear one song and have a favorite artist of all time. Tom > ALL
KETO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
God I can't watch this...
Thank you Tom. Your lyrics speaks of my everyday journey.  Days are hard and night are long but I'm a fighter. No rapper describe cancer so accurately as you do in your song.
Protect Tom Macdonald at ALL COSTS.
Thank you, that's all bro
I have lost my grandfather and father-in-law to lung cancer and my foster mother to thyroid cancer. They were three of the greatest people and helped others. Thank you for this song and I am sure it’s going to help so many people!
Thanks for this one. I wish I had it when I lost someone. Im glad it might help someone else though.  Cry-screaming with a smile.  Have a good one.  Hold it down.
If I get cancer I know I’ll go politician or banker hunting , I’ll give up peacefully and mock the entire trial probably bite off my lawyers ear or nose
Wow!!!
I love all your videos
Damn I was not expecting thing from you! You have so much heart! The world needed this song!
Love the emotion you portrayed in this video!
First everyone that dislikes this has no heart. My wife is a cancer survivor she lost her ability to have children. My cousin lost his ability to have kids from working on cell towers the radiation caused it it spread to his bones luckily they were both strong and survived it. The amount of money that’s made from treating will never allow a cure greed is more important than lives I guess.
Honestly......3.3K dislikes?!?   Great message and great video!
I have watched many of your videos in the last 2 hours since I discovered your beautiful brain and skills in so eloquently expressing so many of my own frustrations this last year,,,, plus. I haven’t commented because who really cares what I think, but for this I need to say something. Thank you! I’ve been by both of my parents side in the last 5 years as they each battled cancer and it was my job to always keep the smile on and to not allow them, or my brother and sisters, to ever consider that losing those battles was an option. They made it through, thank god, but the fight or worry of relapse never truly ends and every 6 months that fear is faced again. So my thank you is for allowing me to cry, it’s been a long time coming and it feels so good to finally let it out! Thank you!!! ❤️
I can't explain how much this song is touching EVERYONE. Chills everytime i listen. My 2 father figures BOTH were lost to Cancer. My bio pop-pop & my F.I.L. the past year. The treatment kept him fighting longer than ANYONE AT 73YO & HE SOLEY FAUGHT FOR MY 8YO SON. FOR EXACTLY 1YR WE WATCHED HIM DISINTEGRATE AS CAREYAKERS.
this guy is the bomb don,t change for anyone, your music is awesome , keep keeping it real ! i lost many to cancer in my life this song really hits the truth on it all .
Has made me cry more than once and I still haven't had a close friend or family member suffering from this. I can still feel how much inspiration and hope this song brings to so many people. Tom, you bring something amazing to a world that is currently in much need of fighters like you. I'm doing everything I can to spread your messages here in northern Europe Stay strong and keep on fighting for Truth
Watched this threw my tears. Thank you
Just noticed this, good song.  We always reflect when we hear the word.  Lost both my parents and many others to something that seems like it should have a cure by now.
This song just broke me... It's beautiful. I still battle my body's collateral damage from a year of treatment and a coma. I added this song to my workout playlist to remind me that I am a kind of warrior.   Thank you from my soul,  A Mom of 3 and a Cancer Ass Kicker.
This guy is am amazing artist. Great job. You just keep reaching deeper and deeper.
My brother as mecp2 this song means a lot
SO  SHWEEEETTT...much  love  Tee with  LIONS  NAMED LEO.[the music  worldwide} us  help  us  all   always   and  expose  evil  always  .  ...and  TOM ...right  on point...and  watch   '''''run  from  the  cure''...on  here  you  tube..
Thank you for that song just beautiful truth 🙏🏻I will share this with my sister who is battling cancer 💕
I'm separated from my wife rn...and this hit home, I know thats not what it's about but a) her zodiac is cancer and b) her mom just died...we have been fighting to live for the past year and a half...the third verse tho...fucking killed me. Thank you tom for giving us all a voice we didn't know we needed.
Being a survivor myself i know what is like going through this crap. having to go thru two surgeries and then dealing with chemo it sucks. not only that now dealing with depression on top of that it so much fun. i was diagnosed at 19 and im clean but going thru that whole ordeal was crap. im clean now and have been for 15 years thanks tom for making this song. people just don't know what it means to go thru this alone. u family and friends that are there but they don't understand what is like being that young and dealing with that. me and the misses love you music and thanks for all that you are doing.
Lost my dad to esophageal cancer last November. Two days later my daughter (his first grandchild was born). One of the last things he said to me in the hospital was "I wonder if I'll get to hold that little girl. I sure hope so."   He was so excited to be a grandpa and we're all still so sad that he never got the chance.
I feel your pain
Right on the point
My moms had cancer. A year after is was good to go. It was gone. She was murdered in her store she opened to keep kid's off the streets. My youngest brother has stage 3 cancer. A year ago I lost my oldest brother my best friend to the virus. I'm been helping my little brother. The best I can. It's ruff. Lost my 18 year old son to murder by an ex of the girl he was dating. Man I tell ya. This world is not getting any better. Like your music. Keep on doing what you're doing. Speaking the truth.peace brother
Buried my brother-in-law due to lung cancer on 01-20-21. He fought the whole way and only ever wanted good food and family.  He was a proud American white man with a blue collar.  Thank you tom for what you do. Keep speaking from your heart and doing you. Wish there where more like you in the light.
I'm a survivor man this song is so real Tom you're a fantastic lyricist
Fucking love you Tom!!✨💖
🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧 that was amazing (:
❤️❤️
I'm 40 years old and this is the first time I can say I'm a fan of somebody. Thanks for your music and being yourself.
Thank you
YOU ARE FLIPN AMAZINGLY GIFTED AND USE YOUR TALENTS TO THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL!! HATS OFF TO YOU AND NOVA WHAT A UNBEATABLE TEAM YOU HAVE! stay safe and healthy! THANK YOU FOR CREATING ART THAT CAN MAKE THIS WORLD AND THE PEOPLE IN IT BETTER BYE BRINGING THE TRUTH OUT IN THE OPEN. 👍👍👍💪👍💪👍💪💪💪👍💯% ROCK SOLID AND YOU WILL MAKE NUMBER ONE ON I TUNES IN ALL GENRES! if not its rigged just like the election!!!
How in the absolute fuck did people dislike that?
Love this song went through cancer myself back in 2019 for esophageal cancer but everything in this song is true its found a place in my heart ❤
You've always been a truth teller, keep it up Tom, you're a fighter,just hold tighter💯
You just made this 48 year old man cry like a little kid. Amazing song from an amazing artist, and there is no words to describe how amazingly talented Nova is.
You speak so much truth about the money hungry people that see cancer as a money maker instead of releasing a cure. May god have mercy on them for putting money above peoples lives
A heartfelt thank you to you and Nova. You both are gifts to people like me that finds so much comfort in music. No pills no drinking just music and you are so true to yourself and not a sell out for a dollar. God bless you and Nova.
Thank you, Tom, for keeping your creativity inspired by all things important in life!!
Heard this when you first released this and almost broke down in the car going home because my mom was going threw chemo and now she is finishing up radiation. Thanks for such a great song.
Damn !! Tom! Amazing song
Truth.
Thanks Tom you helped me out a lot I love your songs especially this one
Nice to hear someone say how I feel in the form of a song. A good start to reducing cancer is to stop letting the government poison us. They trick us and confuse us enough to get us to poison ourselves. The answers are with prevention not with the burn and cut method and waiting to see who survives longest, cancer or the person.
Imagine if our goverment and medical industry put the effort into stopping cancer like they have covid! ...hmmm
LOVE
Just found out my grandpa as cancer in his intestines. He's an old drinker with alzheimers, he might not make it through surgery because of his age and everything he has put his body through when he was younger. It hurts, having seen someone you remember looking up to slowly forget who you are when you see him next, and then being told they might pass away because of cancer.
And people think that he is evil.
This really hits me hard my grandfather died of bladder cancer 11 years ago
Malpractice is the 3rd leading cause of death in America. They say they care about covid but they just care about themselves.
i beat C ass in 1010
So true .... they create the problem (make us sick) and sell the “solution” ..... thanks for this truth
I see 3.3K 👎on this and all I can say is some people are just straight haters.  I don't care if you like TM or not, the message and delivery was on point and deserves respect.
The hardest thing I ever had to do was shave my wife's head. The easiest thing I ever had to do was shave mine in support.
Damn, Dude! You speak the truth about EVERYTHING!...... Keep it up, the world needs millions of YOU!!!
#releasethecure
Tom is so right about Cancer and something isn't right about there not being a cure for it by now! I have lost several loved ones to Cancer and it's awful. My heart goes out to anyone who has lost anyone to this horrendous condition. I pray that any day now, the cure becomes a reality... Thank you @Tom MacDonald for doing this song, as well as all you sing about and getting so many truths out there and reaching a myriad of audiences of many different age groups!
And I thought I didn’t like rap.
Biden said he would cure it, just to get elected and we all knew it was a lie and now the lies are killing people.
Strong Tom, strong.
How did I miss this song!   My mother and one of my best friends are survivors...but we all know those who have not made it...  Thank you Tom..for this and everything you and Nova do.
Thank you bro, this hits a personal note with me.
Lost my mother to cancer and Tom is the only man or woman to ever make me understand! Not doctors! Not experts! Not specialists.... Tom is just a lyrical genius in all he does and deserves the title of legend of the working class.
Don't be scared cause God said time on this earth is a wisp of smoke in the air against the sands of time. Our souls have been purchased. You need only believe.
I wish my grandma could have heard this
Wow, wow, wow this one had me in tears. So so good
I got a bad blood test 7 days ago,  My next bloodtest in 7 days I'll know if it's cancer, I found this song and am Amazed!, the lyrics this rapper raps about are Definitely WOKE ASF. Blessings 🙏🙏🙏
Holy shit...wow...just wow
Stunning.
Was not expecting this... it hurts
The 3k dislikes on this song everyone of them need shot right between the eyes fuck them
How can this have dislikes? Wtf
Fire
It's nice to hear you sing something inspirational instead of bitching about fuckboys
Cancer is vulnerable between 100.000 Hz and 300.000 Hz using a resonant frequency device. Two frequencies the same, one high one low. Tuned to the 11th Harmonic. Shatters leukemia, prostate and ovarian cancer cells. I been picketing in front of city of hope largest cancer research center in the world. Good on you Tom.
I keep saying the same thing
I didn't expect to cry this morning. My sister recently went through colon cancer at 42. She had the surgery and is going through treatment too. She my light, a Lt Col for the Air Force, I have always looked up to her.
Its true  man my mother  Was diagnosed with cancer a year and a 1/2 ago my grandfather is a doctor and started doing a lot of research found this dog deworming medicine that has been tested in 3 universities and has better success rates than chemo My mother started using it and 6 months later was cancer free unfortunately has returned
Anyone who says they will "cure cancer" just to get elected should die from cancer. (Biden)
Awesome song and video well done ~ Thanks
lost my cousin my best friend in the world had brain tumor ended up being cancer he was strong for 2 years this last year he passed away at 21 my best friend in the world miss him more then anything tom your a saint for this song much love brother
This song brought me to tears. Thank you Tom MacDonald, you made a lot of good songs that I've discovered in the last 2 months, but this is very well may be your best and at the very least this song will be sticking with me probably for the rest of my life. Also good visuals Nova Rockefeller.
My Momma lost her fight against small cell on Feb 17, 2021. She was buried just 6 days ago and this is the first time I have heard this song. Tom, thank you for speaking out about all the research, yet, "no cure" because there is so much money to be made on the poisonous treatments.
Lost my mom to lung cancer after fighting almost 2 years god decided to take her home with him I love you mom
U cant experience strength till u try to carry the weight
Lost my Daddy after a valiant 7.5 year battle with Colon/liver cancer. He spent all of this years on chemotherapy. 8 months on, 4 months off.  Watching him actively die his last 4 months of life was the worst thing I’ve ever witnessed in my life (and I’m in healthcare). I’ve seen terrible things at work, but they’re more acute. To watch someone you love - the man you know as your protector- the strongest man in the world, slowly die in agony is the most horrific, unnatural thing (next to burying a child) that life can hand you. I know we all bury our parents, but it shouldn’t be this way.  It • should •not •be• this • way 😔  Cancer sucks. And they can stop it. And they cause it. It’s all about the mighty dollar. Tom nailed it. He always does
One fighting suicide thoughts.... Go hang out in the chemo ward with those fighting to live. God bless and give you wisdom 💜
Essiac
Sadly, I have people close to me who are fighting with a cancer a diagnosis and treatment. I listen to this song daily. You don’t know how brave how you are until you are scared are true words. The situation is dire for sure.
Thank you. Tragic but so true.
Anything you don’t do heavy duty, Tom? This one hits home.
The FEELZ. I I just don't have words for how real and beautiful this is.
survived it 4 times so far.  dont know why i get to live and others dont.   hear Tom echoing alot of things that went through my head.  sounds like he knows someone.
This is for sure gonna help many many people. Good for you 🙏🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸
I took my girlfriend to every treatment, in 1 year and 4 months I watched the one I loved most grow weak. It spread to her brain, "I have a headache", That was the last text I got from her in hospice. She told me that she would watch over me when she goes. It was 2 days after  I arrived at hospice and she was gone. I had spent 16k on every treatment. RIP C***tyl ;(
Who ever disliked this needs to go straight to hell M
I lost my dad in 2009 to breast cancer of all things. He was the biggest strongest man I've ever met and I watched him become a shell of himself physically. However the amount of inner strength he showed during his fight of over 3 years was nothing more than inspirational. You really never know the true strength of a person until they have to fight. This song hit nerves that haven't been touched in a long time. I thank you deeply and wish everyone the best. With all the evil that's going on in this world Cancer is the one thing we can all openly hated and not be ashamed to do so.
I've lost my grandfather and father to cancer. My mother and I have had it. I truly believe that there are cures out there but only if you have $$$, power, and affluence.
Hi Tom I'm trying so hard to get people my age in a little bit older to think about rap is not being crap. I posted this song just a minute ago I know it's old maybe that song this song will help them wake up to how real you are and how much you care about all of us. I will support you as long as you stay like you are real a real person
3.3k people dislikes. Some humans make me sick.
A lil late watching the video, wasn't able to watch til now. I lost my oldest brother to lymphoma in August 2020. Another brother in 2018 to skin cancer that spread and wasn't caught in time and my mom in '97 to pancreatic cancer. Crying so much now but trying to remember the good times I had with them 💔
The stats at the beginning are shocking. Pharmaceutical companies would lose a LOT of money if the cure ever got out. They make more money from no cure.
So found out yesterday my fiancee could be battling cancer get results back tomorrow I just hope she knows how much she means to me thank you tom for making this song much love brotha
Tears here ..
Dude makes song against cancer, 3.3K people disliking it for some petty BS, probably politics. Unbelievably stupid.
Funny how this song don’t get the recognition it deserves ! Keep doing you Tom!
I love you Tom Macdonald,
Still don't get how 3000 people can dislike this
This is so true my daughter at age 6 was diagnosed with brain cancer.  She was one of the lucky ones to make past the treatments but we lost so many friends along the way we met.  You live in a different world at what most people don’t even know exist.  Thank you for spreading the word..
I had Leukemia from 2003 to 2006, I was 17 when I was diagnosed.  I was crushed, scared, full of confusion, I had no idea if I was going to live.  I didn't want to die.  I fought with everything I had and more, and somehow I won.  I am 34 going on 35 now and I choose to help those who have cancer as well.  Never give up.  No one asks for cancer.  You can end up doing everything right, as in no drugs, no bad foods, always exercise, and somehow you can still get cancer.  It's not fair.  However you are right, you don't know how to be brave until you choose to fight when you are afraid.
What a beautiful song!! Your an Amazing artist
My dad died because of lungs cancer Tom and i'm out of words listening to your songs. You are so real!
This is next level!
Thank you Tom and Nova God bless you guys!
Thank you Tom Macdonald is beautiful song! Please pray Ally she’s going through cancer right now! Stay strong have faith don’t give up!❤️🙏
I never comment, but I have to here. This song is an absolute masterpiece and anyone who has dealt with cancer be it a family member or themselves can 100% relate to this song. I lost my grandfather a minute before midnight new years eve 2014 to cancer, I watched the life leave his eyes then heard fireworks outside right after; my mother has beaten cancer 4 times and shes only 38; and I recently found out one of my online friends I used to play with everyday lost the battle with stage 4 cancer. This song hit me in my soul.
It's true.  I have a very expensive cancer.  I'm pretty certain I will go bankrupt. 🚶
Thank you Tom, And God Bless.....
Omg. I love song brought tears too my eyes my daddy just passed jan2"2021 from cancer rip vince Jerrells I miss u everyday
The more i listen i think dont stop Thomas !! Im a 53 year old former marine oorahh. And I remember why enlisted and it was for every living breathing american no matter their skintone. It was for all of us . i feel you when you say all theese groups divide us we are all americans!!!! Thanks again for reminding everyone.💪
I watched my strong husband die  in 11 days.
I have wondered for a long time why cancer has no cure!! We are too smart to not figure this out!!  It is a money maker.
You've seen me comment before.This touches me because they are watching me for cancer.It's a scary thing! I haven't seen you write anything that doesn't pertain to someone.Keep up the great work "TESTIFY"!
I was 5 years old the first time my dad (who was 32 at the time) was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma. I was 15 the second time he was diagnosed with the same thing. I was 31 when he finally lost the battle for his health, after suffering so much damage due to the effects of the radiation and chemo treatments he went through to cure the cancer.  He was a Vietnam Veteran. He served as a door gunner in a helicopter unit, where he was constantly exposed to the effects of Agent Orange. Our government KNOWINGLY poisoned our Vietnam Vets with that crap. There were studies that showed it wasn't safe, but they used it anyway because it was the most effective defoliant they could come up with. Many of our best lost their lives in Vietnam, many lost their lives later. You're right Tom....$90 billion raised for research and they still only have radiation and chemo to try to "treat" cancer. And if you don't die from the cancer, the treatment kills you!!!  But I gotta add that my daddy had peace because he KNEW where he would be if he didn't make it. John 3:16
Im not crying...you are
R E S P E  C T for his genius is what Tom McDonald should receive. He elevates people toward a comfort level unrealized in our society today.
I ain't afraid to admit this song had me in tears. Too many family and friends gone. Thank you for this song Tom, and God bless you
A unknown virus comes out of nowhere and spreads across the world in less than a month, and their able to create a vaccine for it in 9 months. Yet, they can't cure or come up with a vaccine to prevent cancer??  Yeah. Ok.
We are totally capable of healing ANYTHING through fasting and meditation. You are your own healer, born with no need for a doctor.
This gives me chills listening every time it comes on Spotify. Tom really fucking brought his A game this song. My dog is the only real cancer death I've gone through and I hope everyone reading this that's struggling finds peace, and that this song helps make things a little easier.
💗
So true they can make a vaccine in one year to help a virus that they “have no clue” about but they can’t find a cure for the top deadly Diseases that’s been around for decades. Smh
Man.... this hit hard. Month ago had to help lower my grandfather in the ground from cancer he had fought tooth and nail. Took this track to finally crack my walls to mourn.
This man is amazing. He is really using his blessed voice God has given him. Thank you Tom for your truths in music. Music is a blessing and should be used in this type of manner.
Both grandfathers, grandmother, 2 uncles, 3 aunts, then my mom.  Don't know how anyone can click dislike on this song!  He's right - the $ is what they're after, and the gov't involved & paying just makes it worse.  Won't fix it till we the people take our power back & overturn these elites who drain every penny from our pockets.  Love your music, love your heart Tom!
There is a cure that our governments have been hiding from us. Big Harma would lose money.
It's crazy how words put to melody can illicit such emotion
Fuck cancer. I lost too, rest easy Bob, miss you man.
Thanks for being you.
the 3.3k thumbs down are a clear indication that the people who hate tom dont even bother to listen to his music.
This hits home...my dad had cancer twice and passed away when I was 18. Im 38 now and Its definitely in the back of my mind if or when ill get it .
inspiring! (Y)
Wow. This brought tears to my eyes. Caught your video from Officer Tatum and been watching your videos. You are very talented and brutally honest! Keep up the good work.
this made me cry
WOW
Vaccines= 99% of health problems along with mental disorders
"were dying to keep living"
this made me tear up for all those people out there in the world going through this I wish I had the power to heal you all
Such a powerful song!!!
I haven't had a song make me cry in years Tom you deserve the very best award in the world for this one and it still wouldn't be enough thank you man.
Anyone who disliked this I hope you learn this song is such a good song that is on such a serious subject and this isnt one of his go hard songs this is so good
my mother died of cancer, 1 day after we found out she had it, she went for a bad nose bleed, never came home, last words she said to me, take care of "Gabby" her cat, that was the last thing she said, her cat died a month later.
1 teaspoon (preferably freshly ground)flax seed oil and 3 table spoons cottage cheese mixed thoroughly.  for breakfast every day until cured.  then maybe once a week to stop flare ups.  it's an old native recipe that a canadian school teacher was using to cure people of cancer decades ago.  i'll test it when i get cancer.
Government and doctors and layers and such as courts. All only care about fucking money. Not lives. Fuck them.
I'm not crying, you are. Fucker. ..........*sniff* Good song. *sniff*
Cancer from keeping our demons a secret.... this is it.
Its called control the population. There has been a cure for years. They r not to let that info be known. They know how it feeds. There is other meds for stuff that can cure and or be less harmful to us but refuse to let it be made or have. People get told many things, made promises, and lies so on. Our world is made up with evil people who will do anything for power. We r being conned everyday by tv movies and more. The less the people the easier to control. Its time for this stupid fighting to end. We r the same inside. The more they can keep us poor the easier to control.  The next few years here to come is going to be hell like cancer. We need to fight for our rights. News has been full of bs since it began. Start to question everything. Like why did no help go to Texas, where is the money and help from covid, y do they seem to only care about them, y r they coming after anyone with a gun, the list goes on.  Wake up people and start helping each other and being here for each other.  I am sorry for all with cancer may the god of heaven be with u all. I am fighting a war with my body that has no cure. Ik I am not to be alive right now. I guess my number never came up yet. many people have the lighter side of what I got but the doctors r rare to find or care to learn about it. They blame it on u and say u r making this happen to u. But in rl they dont know a thing about it so we suffer and die from it.  Welcome to the rl world called we love power, money, and control.
All of his songs are powerful and true but this one hits on new level. Iv lost family to cancer and had others survive. This song reminds of how hard they all fought and how strong those that suffer can be.  Never give up you are all stronger than you know.
My dad died from cancer 9 years ago and it hurts still today
So much pain and anguish and grief in the comments, you can feel it. But hope as well.
THERE IS A CURE FOR CANCER, GENE THERAPY - but we can't afford it...
More like 50... I am a 50 year Survivor and I lost almost everyone one both side to it... I one of the VERY LUCK ONE.. 50 WARRIOR SURVIVOR IF YOU ONLY KNEW..
Fast. Abstain from the world.
💎💎💎💎💎💎💎
Survivor... metastasized testicular cancer in both my lungs when I was 23. Now I’m 50 🙏
Thank you just lost a wonderful woman to this deadly disease and left two children without there mother. Thank you for your true facts in your music really needed it today.
3.3K people have never lost a loved one to cancer.
I lost my best friend to cancer almost 3 years ago, Thank you Tom, this song reminds me of all the good times we had together :)
This is true. When I was a kid, cancer was a mythical disease that hardly affected anyone. Now we all know many people that have been affected and many who have died. I’ve often wondered about the billions that have gone to cancer charity- how much have they actually helped people? How many different corporations have poisoned our environment, water and food supplies over the years in the name of profit? When will it stop? When they kill everyone?
Just last year I lost my Dad to a Braintumor. Cancer is just fucked up....I´m sorry for everyone who goes through the struggle. Keep fighting and be there for your loved ones. I know it´s hard but spend as much time together as possile! Make Memories together and keep them in your Heart. For evveryone who has cancer....You are strong! Stronger than most of us will ever be! Take every second and make it worth it no matter what! Much love to ya all.
its insane to me that a white rapper that looks like Tom is the only musician i can think of who has made me (a grown man at age 31) cry like a little bitch... the world needs you more than ever Tom. god bless.
"I'm dying to keep living" wow that hit hard
I was told in 2010  I would not see the end of 2011 " MAY CAUSE DEATH "   was the first warning on meds I took for years  In 2016 I heard the words  It " WILL BE ANY DAY "   So I decided to die my way  I walked away from the specialist  And the 13 different meds I was on cold turkey  I had to prove my mental ability to make this decision    If I had not give control of my life to Jesus  I would not have one   ..... so this hits home  Thanks for the truth you share in your songs  Truth has become so rare No one can accuse you of selling out  So you have bragging rights not many can claim  So please stand tall Like it or not Eyes are upon you  And what they are seeing is a good thing Continue strong on this path you are on  .... know you are being prayed for by parents of the kids that are your fan base ...  we appreciate you
2 Mil. Views??? What the hells wrong with people watch this video it’ll help!
I have autism so I have also have issues thank you so much for this
The cure to cancer is not eating the trash in the supermarkets, not eating that sick chemically raised corn fed beef, and pesticide filled, oxalate rich vegetables in the supermarket. Eating your oxidized vegetable oil chips and sod, Eat healthy cows, raised on grass like it they are meant to be, eat their livers, brains, kidneys, eat organic tubers like potatoes or corn grown without chemicals, of course that's hard, shit like this is hard to grow in nature without chemicals, but eating stuff like this is why your sick, why your dying, even why your covered in acne..
We live in a culture where people champion your favorite soda/chip/fast food brands, and people wonder why diabetes/cancer and obese pandemics... And then these large companies fund Vegan/meat industries and promote people who sell "healthfoods" like Collagen powder which is just a useless waste product... And vegetables like kale which can actually cause health issues Just so they can keep making money... No shit where sick, everything is owned by Monsanto and pharmesudical companies who just happen to make all the money off making us sick and then giving us drugs, but whats worse is the god damned stupid people who buy their shit, we keep them in power...
This hits hard, my girlfriend has been diagnosed with breast cancer twice in the last four years, I’ve been through that journey with her, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery. Lots of love from Manchester U.K!
Mrna gonna change the future for cancer treatments if they succeed it's done with radio therapie and endless money grabbing. personally can't wait i've seen enough people die from it.
There are lots of  cures for cancer.  Money is not the cure.  It's the curse.
I needed that thank you....
Thank you! I've been sharing ur music& honestly do it when I'm drunk& high.This is a beautiful song& this does touch home& I love ever single human( well not everyone) but Tom's song says everything for me& my love is to any& every fighter love from Florida!🤟🤟😘
there are cures that big Pharma is hiding from us,  They purposely make us sick to get rich, its criminal
Thank You so much for this song. I had breast Cancer and pray it never returns. I am all my son has and he is hugh functioning autistic and still needs me around. I hate the thought if there is a. Cute and so many has died. Those greedy bastards can't take that money with them to the grave and they sure hell will not live forever so why?? Why be greedy? Anyhow they will meet the maker one day
I don’t have cancer, but I have Multiple Sclerosis. I was dx at 16 and have spent over 20 years since as a lab rat while my body slowly broke down. These past few years its drastically accelerated and ive lost almost everything that kept me feeling normal. I’ve been struggling a lot and the chorus of this song really broke through my tough sarcastic external wall and my heart poured out along with a flood of tears. Thank you. Thank you for helping me feel. I spend so much time numb justin trying to keep a brave face. But Im scared and desperate to live again. So many days pass that my only goal is to get up feed my pets then i lay back down. I take more meds than people 3x my age just to do that. I was that over achieving type a perfectionist determined to do everything for everyone my whole life. I was always the rock and the one who lifted up everyone else. You learn quickly when you are the raft for others they are not the raft for you. My dog & 2 cats have kept me going. Knowing they need me. But some days i wish I hadn’t woken at all. But I know the pain it would cause my family so I keep going. Right now im just existing not living. And you don’t realize how much you have until its gone. You don’t realize all the stress and crazy busy days are what life is about until the minutes, hours and days drag on. So please everyone try to find joy even in those crazy days. Trust me it’s something you’ll miss. Im still fighting and praying for a cure one day. If not for myself for those children just beginning diagnosed who deserve to live life. This song really helped. Thank you. God bless
Oh man....Tom, you straight up get double dose of respect from me !!!  I am a 36 year cancer survivor, that lost my older sister to cancer in 2013. Sometime I feel sick to my stomach because I survived and she didn't.  I am told that God has a special plan for me, but I can't understand why God chose me over my sister. Don't mean to speak blasphemous towards God, and it is not my intention, I just think to myself that God didn't want her to suffer any longer, but had bigger plans for me.   Thank you so much for addressing cancer !  Peace brother.
The lyrics in this guys lyrics are put together very well in all of his songs.  He says what runs through my mind, but cant quite say so clearly myself! Peace Brother ✌
This just gave me chills! Amen! Fuck cancer
Look into hemp oil early on!
My mother passed from Ovarian cancer in '93 I was 16 w/ two younger brothers. My younger brother, mother, & I all share something in common other than D.N.A. we 3 are epileptic. Our mother had both cancer & epilepsy! R.I.P. WE WILL MEET AGAIN!!!
F*** man 😢😢😢 lost my brother 3 years ago. This hit me hard and fast.
People say I'm good old for this type of music.  I Love all your messages.  You and Nova keep up the great work, I'm proud of you!
🖤
God bless you 🙏 ❤  I am in this  World 🌎  But not of this World   Beat cancer at 22 stage 4
Damn this just hit 😓 my boyfriend has stage 4 glioblastoma and isn’t doing good at all 🙏🥺
This one hit hard I lost my grandma is 06 of cancer and lost so many people tthese last 7 year this song brakes me down but after listening to it I start thinking of the good times thanks tom
There is more money in TREATING than CURING!
Excellent
Mom has cancer and the doctors say she will make it and i just hope that's true love the song man
Population control..lost mom to that shit in jan 2020 the. Dad April 2020... its all about money..u have shit ton you'll live longer then most
This is so incredibly sad. I spent 9 months with my father. I was with him day and night. He was one of a kind. He did everything his way. Everyone loved him. Thanks for the truth.
I have a rare chronic blood cancer that has no cure. I’m lucky because it’s manageable with oral chemo meds and should have a normal life otherwise.
Not only do we pay for our addictions but we pay taxes on them as well. I truly believe they have cures for most everything. But there’s no money in a cure. Only in treatment pills and vaccinations. Sad truth
Damn bro, your songs move this old jaded bastard. Thank you.
Funny, this song is full of facts. You’d think it would be plastered on the news and in media... oh wait.😏😞
Wow. Yeah,
I hate cancer my dad died too cancer  And I didn’t give up hi fight the cancer but hi died so this song make me cry on a Good way thx bro
I need a Tom MacDonald action figure
Tom is literally out here spreading truth and comfort. He may have tattoos and look “different” but he seems to have a heart that most of us don’t seem to have today. Not because we are all nasty and hurtful but we are scared to show compassion for others around us. I Love everyone here! Everyone is special and amazing.
Didn't know who you were before tonight. Heard a couple songs and stumbled across this one... I just lost my mom to cancer last week. Delivered her ashes to her mother tonight and am having a rough go at it. Guess I needed this to let go some emotions. I appreciate the way you call it how it is in your songs. We need more like you to help this world. Peace, man. ✌
iv had cancer twice and this song made me cry your so right tom they do have a cure for cancer  if they can get a vaccine for covid in less than a year why are we still dying from cancer thankyou for writing this song it brings home to many our struggle
Tom, thank you! I wish we were next door neighbors. I'd love to hang out with you. Thanks for all you give back!
Thank you. I watched my Mom die of cancer. 8yrs ago yesterday. She was my hero, she was the strongest person Ive ever known. She refused hospice so I moved back home and quit my job to take care of her because she was afraid to die in a hospital alone. It was the hardest thing I have ever done. Watching my Mom slowly waste away, she didn't know my name by the end. But she died in our living room surrounded by people who loved her. I thought it broke me. Turned out I was shattered but holding on. I cry when I hear this, and I play it often, but 'you don't know how much you can take til you realize you didn't break' ... these words mean so much to me. This song is about something devastating but its the only song that makes me feel better. The strength in fear and pain of cancer is so often overlooked. Thank you for giving me something that can make me feel the loss but focus on the strength inside it. Thank you.
Another amazing real life situation that was done so beautifully!  Tom and Nova, yall are awesome!  Thank you for sharing your talents with us.
Kemotherapy and radiation is supposed to help but it destroys the body. Big pharmaceutical companies benefits from these treatments. My aunt gave up the will to live because she said she was and her body was tired from the kemo and radiation. She was tired of the way it made her feel. I miss you everyday that your not here with us. We miss your smile, your laughter and your good home cooked meals.
This song hits home so hard. I love you Pop's. Thank you for everything.
I lost my niece that was 22 yrs old brought up all those memories of what she went through had me bawling it's been almost 25 yrs  ago very touching song an powerful song an vieo
As a cancer survivor I love this song I had AML when I was 2 and I was in the hospital for  a year so this song hits home 😭❤️
Thank you, Tom this hits home for me as my Grandpa is dying of Cancer at 93. Praying for strength and endurance for all those who deal with cancer. Let’s keep fighting for a cure.
THEY HAVE THE CURE FOR CANCER GOOGLE KILLER T CELL Douglas Olson
SPEAKS THE TRUTH.
Damn
It's a roller coaster mentally that's for sure.
The cure is the dr.royal Ramond rife machine!!!
you made me cry, I miss my son
Damn!!! ... just when I think I'm over it and moving forward with life,  reduced to tears again.  I lost my Mum to an aggressive cancer on the 9th January 2019 and my fiance to melonoma in 2004.  I guess you're right, facts don't care about feelings but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't feel them or forget.  So  thanks Tom, this song hits home for way too many. Love from Australia ✌🙂👍🇦🇺🇺🇸
The money's not in the cure, it's in the treatment.
Truth,,,,,,, My brother is patient 1 in  a melanoma study, he has used the European diet and has been cancer negative ( not free ) for 11 years so their is a cure just not here
Do you know they even know some cancers are genetic. Yeah. My family have genetic line of sevral different cancers
Coming up on 2 years NED. Diagnosed at 31 with 3C low grade serous carcinoma. Nothing is know about this type except only less than 10% of women in the world get it and it has a 98% of reoccurrence. You were right about no one wants to leave. I have a now 5 year old son and I’m not ready to leave him behind.
My mom fought 3 different cancers and beat them all. One of those cancers was melanoma and they did surgery to remove the mole and surrounding tissue. They said they got it all but to be on the safe side do one round of chemo...she said yes. Well 5 years later the day after Thanksgiving we found out she had cancer again and she had to go to a bigger hospital then the one we were at, well long story short she had AML (acute myeloid leukemia) with a 23% chance of survival.  She fought hard and even got strong enough for a bone marrow transplant. She passes away the week she was suppose to have the transplant. We found out that the melanoma chemo side effect was AML. Just always know tomorrow is never promised and to live and hold those close to you!
I lost my brother to cancer back in may of last year..Thank you for this man! #FuckCancer
I had family members who beat cancer and had some who lost to cancer. Not gonna lie, I’ll put on my big girl underwear and admit I cried. I miss them. ❤️
damn this made me tear up
Who in the fuck disliked this you must be part of pharma sick Fucks Tom put it all out there and never stop your message may enlighten a lot of people!
If you have a dry eye watching this... I hope you never have to experience the pain for yourself or a loved one.
I feel like you have carefully picked thoughts, like leafs off foreign flowers, right out of my head.  Wrote them down and screamed them out. Giving us a reason to live 🖤 thanks for helping me pick up my damaged wings
I still can't believe this song came out the day we discovered my mom had cancer. She died five days later. This song is so true.
Thankyou
how can someone dislike this!! i know this will help so many people ...I pray that you all have good health and long prosperous life!
Thanks Tom, stage 4 cancer survivor here.  I have had many friends pass since my treatment....think it is tougher seeing them go than the treatment.  KEEP SPEAKING THE TRUTHS.
I nearly cried
Can someone give him a goddamn nobel peace prize already.  Cancer sucks and my mom kicked it’s ass. ✌️💗
FUCK CANCER. RIP MOM..I LOVE YOU ALWAYS
. Johnson & Johnson has been on the front lines of every war making billions or trillions from medical supplies. Today they have introduced a vaccine for a pandemic they were part of to begin with. Nice scheme.
99% sure theres a cure for cancer but they make so much money from patients that they cant release it
After treatment it didn't help. I went holistic & did sound frequency therapy; when they did surgery it came back benign a year later. Everytime someone I love is sick, to this day I prey I take it. I made peace with death then & I would rather go than someone I love; I know I'm ready, i'd prefer to give them more time. Those who have come too, know when fear has left your heart, you simply know they human experience is not home.
Yur a lyrical alien, which planet yu Frm? Bless up
I love this song. Means everything to me .thanks tom 👍
IT'S ALL BY DESIGN!!! ALL GOVERNMENTS & MAINSTREAM  ARE AGAINST ALL LIFE & CREATION PERIOD!
Gives me perspective about what’s important in life.
My best friend got diagnosed with two forms of cancer back in November, and she hasn't set up any appointments to see what her opinions are. And he won't do chemo or radiation. Im afraid she's going to wait to late for treatments. And I am not ready to lose my best friend. I pray everyday for the Lord to give her strength and courage to get through this. If all possible I will stand with her and help her
3.3K  big pharma cancer industry whores, and/or sheep dislike...
I had Diffuse Non-Hodgkin Large B-cell Lymphoma. I fought and I won! If anyone want to talk let me know.
The dust in here messing with my allergies. 😭
My son was diagnosed with cancer at 4. Hes 11 now and in remission!
I iived. message me please
Been dodging this one. Tom you are legit. Hard to watch... thanks for making it boss. Lost a friend to this one. And will lose my grandad to this as well... God bless you boss. And God be with all those who are walking in this dark valley
My Pop's gave 20+ years to fight for this country. He told me he had cancer and it broke my whole world. He will always be stronger than most, with just the love he showed us five kids. Even when his wife up and walked out, because he was fighting a battle she couldn't be a part of.  Best fighter I will ever know in my lifetime. Thank you Pop's for being a true man. Love you with all my life!
This broke me dog
Thank u Tom McDonald I can guarantee someone who is sick or a family member will get a little peace from ur words . Stay up sir
There is a brilliance to Tom that is the reason he captivates so many — he honestly describes “The Cage” we all live in. It’s the only true measure of an “Artist” — relevance. He’s tough when required, angry when you’d expect, and vulnerable throughout which brings out a joy for life that he instinctively wants to share with others. It’s a magical formula to watch unfold. 🤘
Tom your music is amazing and you keep it real .Thanks for what you write please keep getting the word out what's going on in this world you are a blessing man.
My wife is dying from multiple myeloma. I'm crying over a rap song.
“Nothing matters if you don’t have your health” damn 🥺😩📈📈📈📈📈
This dosen't have any emotion. The way that we're dealing with cancer is a systematic problem but the people are the ones who fund the system. The reason why it doesn't change is because they choose to pay for the poisons and do what there told.  The government uses our money to pay for "Cancer Research" that dosent mean they are looking for a cure. Nobody is out here demanding the government actually comes up with a cure. If we the people start fighting for transperancy and only paying for results then we might actually find one. Insted of complaining abut how your Grandparents are hiding their deamons you should help them get some exercise. Instead of making them feel bad because they aren't getting treatment, make them feel loved, wanted, needed, give them a reason to live and fight and they would start helping them selves. Your a self made man Tom, you have a voice, you should be using it to spread love instead of fear
Hard hitting
Listening to this on a work break.   Trying to hold back tears. Lost my mom from brain cancer out of no where. Collapsed at work, within 6months she was gone.   Thank you for this song.
This just saved me i was ready to stop treAtment today cause i am tired of the fight when it seems i am losing the battle thanks man i needed this
Literally heard this song on the way home from work tonight for the first time and it hit me like a fucking bus.  My grandma is fighting cancer right now and its so fucking hard seeing a loved one go through this.  If there is a cure for cancer I hope the pieces of shit who are keeping it from our loved ones have a special place in hell waiting for them.  Thanks for this song man, its way late after this song came out but I needed this right now.
My grandmother passed away from cancet 2 years ago and just two weeks ago we found out my dad has stage 4 loung cancer that has spread to his bones and brain, this hits hard.  Thanks for your message.   Keep strong brother
3.3K people love cancer. SICK.
Fck cancer!!! 🖕🏻
Okay you have me my girl in tears. Tom your video brought us here and the comments brought the tears.I lost my Dad 20 years ago to cancer,My GF lost her mom 10 years ago to the same. Excellent Excellent video and words Tom
This is an amazing message.
Chokes me up bro! Thx for your efforts! Very commendable sir!
My beautiful sister was taken by this monster (Cancer). She fought till the end. Every day is a gift. She and her husband did not drink or smoke, they exercised, worked hard, and loved to travel. She was diagnosed with multiple lymphoma when she was 55. For three years she fought, and suffered. Chemo, radiation, surgeries. Her husband did not leave her side. It really hurt to see them go through this. I cried when I saw this video
Damn Tom .. you just threw a hand full of sand in my eyes ...
It refreshes my soul to hear your educated mind spit lyrics of the truth. Love u and your girl so much. I have had a diagnosis years ago. I have never went further than their opinion I would have been dead years ago if I let them inject me in the chamber of the doctor office
All I can say is wow!
I'm happy to see someone finally putting out a message about something that's important. My Grandfather was struggling with cancer last year and fortunately beat it and is recovering from it. A lot of rappers rap about stupid shit that doesn't matter and seeing someone rapping about staying strong in these times certainly put a smile on my face.
I lost my Dad to leukemia a year ago Toms music hits home on so many levels.   Trade it all for a little more time cause in the end the time we spend together being  mindful of the moment is the only time we will every get together!
Thank you tom. I got of work and found your music and just laid back and vibed. They don't make them like you anymore. Keep it up. You got one more fan
my mom died of cancer ty for giving a good messige <3
I lost my mother and brother one month apart this past year.
You have a cross tat on your neck. Do you really think we don't know where we go? You're telling the truth man, that means something.
Oh there's a cure for most... it's just not profitable for anyone, until it hits Them! Sadly, by then they believe their own lies🙏
I lost my mom to cancer and that was the hardest thing I had to watch and live through day by day, to watch the strongest woman I will ever know go through that. I haven't cried since then, that was 5 years ago and I listened to this song and you literally touched my soul! Keep doing what you're doing brotha!!! 🤘❤️❤️🔥
Lost both grand mothers to cancer. One taken before I was born. The other one taken 3 years ago. I reckon their is a cure and some sick son of a bitch gets off on letting people die.
Yhanks hun..you two are so cute together..my husband and I are both survivors of cancer...me cervical and my husband throat ..they removed his lymph nodes and we check next month for the sign off on it..thank you both and your friend too..take care stay safe and plz keep it up..luv frm mt st helens wa
Truth
It's true they should have a cure but they won't make it.
Thank you Tom! So many will be blessed by this song!
Until 2030 every 2nd person gets it and in 2050 everybody gets cancer at least once if I remember a study I read a couple of years ago correctly... Even over here in Germany (where they claim that we have one of the best health care systems in the world) a friend of mine might die because the insurance company will not pay the operational removal of breast cancer because it's too expensive in comparison to chemical- or radiotherapy, even she went through this torture already... :(
Are you an angel Tom?
I don't suffer from cancer. And yet this chorus still is so powerful for me. Thank you Tom for helping me keep my head up, and saving my life with your music.
Hell yeah! ❣️
So true !!!
As of last week cancer has taken 2 people from my life and this song actually gave me goosebumps
God dammit man. This shit just made me all misty eyed.
my dad has cancer right now been fighting it for almost 12 years, this song hits home for me❤
Great one!
Lyrics  so real,so true...this just great...I love this piece  for real.💯💥💥💥
My son is not even 2 years old yet ... N it seems we spend more nights in the hospital then we do at home ... he has a very rare genetic disease... Thank you for this video  ...
Love Alone Prevails
imagine being such a bad person you dislike this video
Love love this ! I found your videos about 2 weeks  ago. Totally out of my normal of what I listen too. Thanks Tom!#cancersucks #survivor #kidneycancer
My mum lost her fight 1 week ago we bury mum In 2 days she loved this song we all love this song remember show them you are strong
WOW keep bringing the light tom...
Tom McDonald from someone that was born with cancer and still dealing with the games the system plays with me this song hits deep
How the f##k can any sick sad ba###ds not like this ITS ABSOLUTE ART
My sister      Sandra "Sandi" George Merrill     d.o.b. 7/30/62    d.o.d.  6/30/99 cancer
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
There's a guy here that doesn't like "rap" with tears running down his face. Dude.
The most strongest fighters are not in the UFC!   You wanna see fighters.....go visit your local cancer ward.
Just wanted to say thank you, I haven't cried in a while...
Cancer comes from mutated cells, every time cells need to regenerate at an increased rate your risk of cancer increases.   So this means every time you get hurt, your chances of cancer increase.  Even if humans didn't age we would all die of cancer.
If this doesn't bring you to tears you must have the cure!
2 time cancer survivor 💪🏼 stem cell transplant just over 3 years ago.. always scared it will be back. I’m not scared for me but for my son with autism who needs me.. 😢
One of the lucky ones I guess. Routine colonoscopy /borderline Stage two colon cancer with no spread in the lymph nodes. “Surgery survivor”. Follow up visits at the cancer center, I tried hard to sit with the gray ghosts that seemed to be losing their battle. I prayed with them and helped them up when their name was called. Many were dying alone..... get screened for cancer. It can be a simple blood draw. Be there for somebody with cancer. They need you to let them know that someone cares.
Usually I don't speak about my personnel life on internet but it's the first time a song touch my heart like that.  Last year I lost my mother from cancer, it literally destroy me and few days after that I try to kill myself, I survive and still dealing with depression but this song is better than any medication. God bless you Tom.
The only Rap song to make me cry.
It is all a money making machine. I was in the hospital with a lymphoma that manifested as lesions in my stomach. Took them 6 weeks of me not eating for them to put in a feeding. Despite the fact that I was in the hospital they couldn't get the cancer or bleeding under control. I lost so much blood I had two strokes.  I'm 6'4", and in those 6 weeks of not eating, I went from 255 lbs to 135. But the hospitals are in it for the money.
Powerful Song and Powerful Message. There are lots of natural cures for cancers and our Government FDA and Big Pharma can not make money from it. GOD gave us everything we would need on this planet to cure every illness. Ever wonder why the symbol for doctors is a staff and a snake. Ever wonder why Doctors have a license to PRACTICE MEDICINE. Look up who controls the CDC and FDA they are owned by the Pharma Companies not even U.S. Agencies.
Everybody needs to look into RNAi thearaputics... .. its not the companies delaying the cure... its the FDA delaying everything!
Ok read up on the impact of lead on the Roman society.  They actually sprinkled it into food and drink for flavor.   And the empire fell.   We do 100 times the damage to our selves and wonder why we are all dying and the western nations are falling.
People always talk about conspiracy theory.  Look up the heart attack guns created by the USA in the 60's.  No serious look it up it will scare the hell out of you. And it was created in the 1960's.  Who really knows what we say today is just a theory may be the truth tomorrow.   Side note pay close attention to those who speak up against the government that die in a mysterious  way.   Do you really believe if in the 60's they could kill you with with a gun that causes heart attacks by now they have not found new ways?
I lost my friend in grade 7 to cancer. He was very strong and this song is beautiful. My friend raised $7 million for cancer research and it feels like his life meant nothing.
😎 truth sets you free
Lost my mother to lung cancer last month.  Don't smoke, folks.
Amen Tom.  God bless all those in this fight or any fight they're going through especially the past year.  Life isn't easy so enjoy the good times.
Love this!
Bro,I love your music.ive only been listening to Christian music for the past year,and I still do,but I make an exception for you and Nova.yall are really dope and y'alls messages are extraordinary. Please stay consistent.stay yall.
FUCKKKKK!!!! My mom is fighting another cancer. Nurse for 40 years went thru chemo. Came back harder and now her insurance wont pay for her radiation. This woman has helped 100,000 people and still does but when needs it the world went blank. FUCKKK. We cant afford it and the system is failing us AGAIN. 🤬 IM Losing the best person in my world. FUCKKKKKK
I was sick one night from treatment that day. I had music playing on YouTube to drown out the sound of vomit and this song came on.I slept with my head on the toilet and bathroom floor with this song playing getting me through the night. Thank you for this
I agree that the relay runs and the ribbons don't do anything - but there are people that explain what the cure is: veganism. Simple - spend that money on yourself! Grow your own food - no pesticides or fertilizers if it's grown inside. Filter the tap water - avoid bottled plastic leach! You can't really stop genetic diseases, but we can pull them out of our genes - if people didn't fight it so much.  Someone (in person) said they that they won against breast cancer by drinking welch's grape juice everyday. That's where it's at!
You are the shit brother! Keep it up, love the music, love the message, love that it's just your gang gang...
Living in the ruins in my city ur never see on screen so truth !! My grandma just died of cancer I'm so hurt ! I could use subscribers so I can live good I make game videos.  Give me a chance I dont have many options or family left I need someone to help me I wanna live the dream even if I am working for it idk who to ask tom plz contact me sorry if u think im advertising I'm. Not I need a job now .. I wanna change my life need help
My mom passed away from cancer back in October 2020. Thank you for this.
There is more than you can imagine after this life on earth,for God loved the world so much that he sent his only begotten son that whoever believes in him shall inherit everlasting life. Except Jesus Christ as your saviour and lord and repent of your sins and you shall be saved! God bless all.🙏
Cancer is a horrible disease but there is a disease that is way worse. It’s called greed. Greed is the infection that spreads all over the globe. If we cured greed, no one would die of cancer. Tom, you are the voice of truth that we all long to hear.
RIP May, forever young. love you Tom.
I’m just one more person in a comment section who lost a loved one to cancer .
Thank you but I wish I could of shown my grandmother this
I swear the fake woke crowd subscribes to this man to thumbs down his videos
I see the dislikes. Who in their right mind could dislike this song?!!!
https://youtu.be/a6JFYC1q7WA
Wow xx
I was diagnosed with breast cancer in March of 2019.. Adouble mastectomy w/reconstruction in 2020 and I am now cancer free🙏  When  I was given my options by the doctors.. I told them that there was really only one option and that was to fight and fight hard.  It was the scariest battle I’ve ever had to fight.   and like so many .. I had lost friends and family to Cancer but when it showed up on their life’s battlefield ..they fought and they fought hard so I appreciate your words!   MUCH♥️LOVE
How could anyone dislike this! This is perfect. We all know someone who has passed from cancer. Probably someone very close. I lost my father to it. Again, this is perfect. I know there is life after this. “The Creator did not build a staircase leading to nowhere.”  -I don’t remember  I have had sacred experiences that I know my dad is watching over me and my family still. Keep hope everyone. Else, why are we here?
When you get in struggle with cancer - please, leave town - go and spend your time with animals on some ranch or in a village, or in some cottage, be with goats, cows, chickens, birds, drink sour from milk, eat homemade food and drink a lots of spring waters that come out the grounds. In cities everything is polluted! Even the buildings and flats are polluted from air to electric pollution. You aren't surrounded with wi-fi and electronic in village or on a mountain, that is where your body can recover. No electricity from devices means more electricity that naturally flows in and out of your body. Next thing - barefoot on grounds. Earth is excellent for grounding! You toss out bad things trough your skin especially trough hands and feet that are naked. Do it every night (the Dawn and the Sunset are the magical moments for that!) - bring your loved ones in that environment and I guarantee you'll get your sanity again.
I watched the strongest man my husband ever knew, his grandfather, waste away and die from cancer. The man survived WW2, korea, and Vietnam, only to have agent orange cause so many brain tumors that they couldn't do anything, even chemo. My husband was there, took care of him the whole time, and I watched as it almost destroyed the toughest , strongest man I've ever known, my husband. Cancer sucks, and it's way past time the big money, pharmaceutical assholes really get behind finding a cure. I wouldn't wish cancer on my worst enemy.
Who else wants to go to this mans house and shake his hand and tell him how amazing he is and that he is my new favorite rapper. He is amazing and if anyone disagrees with that they can come to my house and fight me!
This song hit home 💔 Tom lost my sister and uncle within a few months of each other this year. I love your ability to say what everyone is thinking in a manner that provokes thought. Keep up the great work! 🙌
My dude gives people hope...Positive message
Thanks I got brain cancer and this song touched me deeply
The Government is printing money for themselves and the top 1%. We are slaves and they are the slave owners.
Thanks for speaking the truth. I lost my uncle this morning to lung cancer. RIP Uncle Mark
R.I.P. Rush Limbaugh ThankQ
My Father died from Cancer this strikes deep
My dad died of cancer 3 a.m. this morning
Didnt lose a person, but lost my dog last month that had breast cancer.
Dude... NICE ! I am proud of you, AND your career and moves..
Grandpa Grandma Granny Dad  Mom Uncle George Uncle Jack My mentor Carlos Several lifelong friends and now my Uncle Pat. Enough is enough.
My mom got sick in 2004 and I was 6 years old her husband started cheating on her and at that point I stepped up and took care of her I did something at 9 years old that a lot of people will have no idea about their whole life I gave my child hood so my mom could live on and thank God or who ever helped me be strong enough for her and that she is still here with me I know a lot of people will feel this song and have a different out look on it but even though I still have her this song means a lot to me on a personal level.
TRUTH
Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I was diagnosed a year and a half ago with cancer still fighting strong God bless you
They know Cannabis oil kills cancer sells - all types of cancer. This should be on top of all lists in hospitals and cancer foundations.
Thank you
I’m not a person to cry and my bf says all the time u have no feelings but this literally made me cry like a baby. I think tom made every point here.
Dam brah this hit me dead in the heart.i feel the same as you do and in all your song you spit the dam truth and I'm the same way I'm sick of the way the world has become.we need about a million more people who are brave enough to put it out there and say what they feel.i love all your work and am behind you 100% brah love ya brother.
Wow man, I found about you because of "Fake Woke" and I loved it but this song just made fan, you have a rare talent to speak the truth, keep going on, we need more epic people like you. 🔥🔥🔥
My father passed away from cancer 2 weeks ago. It's a bad way to go. I don't want anyone to have to suffer like that.
Nah man. I hate this planet and I want out. My body is trashed from a bomb in Iraq. I'm in pain all the time but I refuse to get hooked on opiates again, so I just let it hurt. I could smoke weed but it's illegal because drug companies want that money. If I pop hot I can lose my disability pay from the VA. I tried suicide but the paramedics brought me back. Now I'm Christian and I can't kill myself. So, I sit and I suffer while people have to help me get dressed, shower and take a shit. I fight to keep going because I have to, but I don't want to be here. I want to go home.
Fuckin love this guy
Just recently discovered this guy, the range of his artistry is amazing! Great work!
Thank you Tom for this song.
Can you make a song about, Joe Biden cheated
God Bless you Tom! RIP Pops
Hey Tom, Thanks for your video. I am a survivor of cancer. I had bladder cancer and liver cancer. I survived  five comas, and I am coming up on two years of a liver transplant which saved my life.The video really touched my heart. Thanks again.
I guess this comment stream shows one good point. If you are desperate enough to slander someone, you'll do it to them even when it is a song meant to give sick people hope to survive. You know you can still give praise to someone you may hate when they do the right thing. If you don't, then what will change.
Listen man I wasn't planning on crying today, what the hell... This is music, this is the shit that the world needs more of. Bringing a person to thier knees with words of meaning and power, that's how art should be.   A few months ago I had no idea who you were, I quickly learned and you moved up the ranks of my favorite artists. But today you took first place and then built a level on top of that to be up in your own little world like the badass you are. Thank you for that, keep doing what you're doing because it's incredible. I'm gonna go find a box of tissues now because, shit man I'm not even joking this hit, hard.
I just took an upper cut right in the feels. Lost my mom when I was 3 to cancer. Things I wouldn't do for just one memory. Cherish every moment. Cancer sucks. Now let me get this dirt out of my eyes.
Goddamit Tom, making me ugly cry in the shower. Fuck that was like getting punched in the spot you already punched me in bro.
Wack I can’t like this again
I was diagnosed with with acute  lymphoblastic leukemia  at the age of 1 years old now then went to chemotherapy and radiation treatment which caused a side effect to my brain to go mentally challenged also have learning disabilities like dyslexia and the doctor told my dad that my brain mental intelligence won’t go past  or beyond 12 years old then at the age of 6 years old I went through remission, multiple spine tap injections and  bone marrow transplants then decades later I went to my final cancer doctor visit here in Las Vegas my blood test results said that I’m cured from acute lymphoblastic leukemia. I have a message who struggled like me and my family when I was diagnosed with leukemia or any type of cancer. Don’t give up on hope and faith tell that to the person who has it  and keep on fighting to the very for that person also pray for them. God and Jesus Christ saved me also my family.
You are an asshole Mr. MacDonald. Making a rap song that's got me in tears. Seriously though, Thank you.
I wish I could have taken the the place of some wonderful people this sickness has taken to soon whom were far better and worthy of living then me.
This made me cry.. :'( Lost my mom last year to cancer, she was 60, I was 25. Almost lost my home too. After a long struggle I finally got things together again. A friend sent me this video and boy am I happy he did!
Holy smokes if the song doesn't tear you up the comments definitely will. Im so sorry everyone. It haunts me everyday.
I belive the evil elite will havw cures for alot of cancers that only they will ever access to:(
How can anyone give this a damn thumbs down?! Do you hate this person so much you can't stand in agreement! This country and world have grown so callus! Truly sad. Thank you Tom for writing songs the reach straight into the heart..
U a real one Tom great to see in this fake world
WOW 🙏🏻
Doctors are scam artists
He's right they know the answer to cancer, just it ain't good for business.
Love you so much! Cancer is a billion dollar industry! All built on lies! 💕
2 years ago lost my best friend, my brother to cancer. Watching someone I love die from cancer while leaving his family consisting of his H.S. sweat heart and 6 girls...killed me, still hurts me. Thanks to Tom for this song...and all the others on hear dealing with losing someone .
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I miss you sis
Tim I love your stuff only you can make me cry from a rap tune I love you man and God bless
My moms cancer spread to her brain about a week ago and this song and the rest of his music keeps me going for my family and especially my youngest siblings. I gotta keep going keep fighting for them
You can't make a person healthy by injecting them with poisons and toxins. Chemo is both a Poison and a Toxin.
Thank you!!! My new anthem for me. 😁❤️🙏🇺🇲
Thank you I listen to this song every time I go to my chemo appointment.
Who’s cutting those fucking onions
❤
A patient cured is a customer lost
Targeted radiation is wonderful and effective with little to side effects. Chemo is what causes most of these terrible side effectives. Radiation is not the enemy it is part of us. the very ground and earth we live on is radioactive. If anything we have not used it to its fullest extent. We think of radiation as what we see in nuclear weapons, but the very sun and earth that give us life is because of radiation.
Love you Brother and what you have to say.. could you take a second to respond to the wondefull people that have left a comment on your vids?
Excellent!! Tom :)
I lost my sister to cancer
My little brother samuel huett beat liver cancer,wilms tumors,and kidney cancer but it kept spreading to his lungs and he was only 10 and too small from prior sugeries to survive. Rest in paradise i will always think of you
Thank you for understanding. Thank you for not being like everyone else. You are an inspiration. Thank you!
Tom Macdonald is a Blessing to this crazy world! ❤️
going through chemo rn
Man how f#%ked up is our world when the machine is trying to cancel Tom. He is one of the saviors we need right now. Oh, and how in the f#&k does this song get over 3K dislikes? Some people are seriously deranged.
Tom Wackdonald back with another hit-- this time trying to be serious and emotional. Crying like a bitch because cancer hurt his feelings. He's running out of material.  Needs to start rapping about getting sentenced to detention in middle school.
Finally had the courage to listen to this song after losing my uncle to cancer last August. This is a great song and you are a great artist tom. Keep it up because you have a lifetime fan in me.
First music video that made me cry,  Dick.
Anyone who dislikes this song are the ones that profit from the radiation knowing it destroys the liver and doesn't heal.  Dr. buttar says if you don't make your patients healthy you shouldn't be paid. I agree.
I've had covid, we're distracted on the wrong c word, it's cancer that is a much bigger, painful, killer.
I had thyroid cancer at 24. I'm 51 now and cancer free. This video and song hits hard.
I lost two grandparents my mother in law and a cuz all to cancer so this so g hits home big time
I found out that I had a large tumor on my left kidney last year...it was cancerous.  I had my left kidney removed on 09/01/2020.  I see all the thumbs down.  How can you thumb down this video????  Thank you Tom just recently found you bro and becoming a bigger fan of you and Nova with each video I watch!!!
I can't believe I just discovered you! I am in awe. Thank you.
❤️
Love your music! But I’m too far gone,gave up long ago just haven’t passed yet.
Finally a voice
I know I'm late to this, but what Tom is saying about medical companies is 100% correct, no conspiracy theories here, just facts. Vaccine for Caronavirus in 1 year. Think about it. I have hemophilia and was born in 83. I watched every man I knew with it die from aids until Magic happened. I dodged it somehow, but I remember when I was a little kid hearing about medicine being out by the year 2000 that would cost a penny. I had friends who tested it. It worked, was in the last stage of approval. I held the reports, it's was 95% effective. You know how much my meds cost today?  $53,000 a month.
Even though I am not young any more I love you Tom, well done friend. RESPECT!!!
so inspiring
been there...believe every word you say.  It is a walk you walk alone but it sees make you strong. 11 surgies in one year with drugs that should've killed but I was a fighter and so far 10 years free of the big C. It sucked. Thanks for thinking of us. Love you Tom McDonald.
Miss you mom....lung cancer was the only thing that could take you down.
Damn
The cure is coming.  And the last person you’d expect is fighting for it to come out.
T_T
Whoa, now he’s hitting Big Pharma....watch out these people are devils.
So 3K+ people disliked this song. Really???
Lost my sister 38 she had 18yr old daughter with dead beat dad.  Legal paperwork difficult for 18 year old that has no network. I  helped in ways. Cancer sucks.
33 years ago my mom died of angiosarcoma, 19 years ago dad died from Mesothelioma, grandson at the age of 1.5 had leukemia he beat it 6 years cancer free now, but where are the cures!
Thank you for making this song. It means more to me than you'll ever know. I lost my father to liver cancer two years ago, He was  67 years old. It still makes me angry that the doctors couldn't do anything for it.  It's great to have a song like this one that acknowledges the injustice and unfairness of it. It is unbelievably frustrating and heartbreaking for everyone involved
I had a second uncle, (not going to say his name, so lets call him uncle bob) and he got cancer when I was seven. I was so darn confused, and scared. me and him were somewhat close. after a few weeks on chemo, his hair fell out. I didn't understand why, so I didn't spend any time with him anymore. I wish I would have, because after a year he died. I didn't get to spend much time before when he passed, so I look back on it today, and it breaks my heart all over again. thanks tom, your music helps me! <3
I love you brother!
This dude spoke my mind!  Este loco canto lo que siento!
Good man you’re right cancer has probably has touched everyone
God blessed you with words that ears hear ,may god bless you and his will be done in your life
Thank you I have bone cancer my son's your age he found you months ago I'm awake now he is
Remember listening to this when it first came out, thinking it was awesome. Then my grandpop got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and died 2 weeks ago. Song hits differently now.
Cancer is just a money machine. Yes.. they did this. Research out of USA.
My grandma died of cancer almost 11 years ago now.   I should quit smoking.
3.2K Dislikes -- WTH.
Grandma died of lung cancer. Never smoked a day in her life. No one around her really did. She was my best friend and it killed me to see her give up towards the end. Makes it even worse knowing they won't cure it because of greed.
Wow! I can’t stop crying! I always told my family that we should avoid radiation for my uncle and because we didn’t he ended up dying anyway and with a big medical bill! For what!! F the system! God bless you Tom!
thanx for mak,ing me cry bruh
i heard over the years that they've actually found better non killing treatments the doctor that finds it ends up mysteriously dead. Why? Exactly what tom says here. they want money more then curing people, why? because it would cost too much for them to give up the treatments that kill people, yes they don't care if it kills kids. The world is filled with horrible greed like that
Lost my both parents at young age. 😪 this is the truth and I love you for this song.
This song is amazing, gives my chills when I listen to it . Love your message in all your 🎶
Lost my mom to cancer 4 years ago. Not surprised being a Marine  mom she battled it for 11 years before she was taken from us. Tom - I have not listen to Rap or hip hip for over 35 years.  In the last two weeks I have listened to almost all your songs. Waited a while to listen to this one because I knew it would hit me hard and it did. Home runs dude.  Keep up the great work and "Fight the power that be. "
Lost my son to cancer..he was 6..yesterday was the 3 year mark of us burying him.  Thank you Tom, this song helps more than you’ll ever know.
I got it, first one in my family to have a genetic cancer. I think I'm beating it. This is my song!
Made me remember my best friend growing up she died from something that only effect her family genes she faught for 3-4 years at age 12 she either gave up from not really being able to live or past in her sleep
“Nothing matters if you don’t have your health....” Amen!!
This guy never *strays from the truth, truly commendable♥️ but he’s only got two modes: 1) F-the-system straight fire🔥😎 2) ALLLLL the emotions🧡😭
I love this song my friend. This song hit home. My mother kicked cancers ass 5 times. She's a fighter. Thank you for this awesome song my friend. 💗 #cancersucks
Great song.... I was diagnosed (the first time) about 2 weeks after my divorce and just days after my office was “reorganized” (and my job was eliminated). That was in 2012.... I’ll be honest, the years since then have been Hell.... I don’t know how any of us managed to survive, but I am happy to report that although I’m battle scarred, weary, will be on drugs for the rest of my life, have lost nearly everything (of financial value), and am still waiting for the child support arrearage, I’m STILL ALIVE..... Although my  kids struggled, they eventually managed to graduate (debt free), are working, and seem to be OK.... And although the health department would probably condemn my (unheated) house, I still have a (leaky) roof over my head 😀 and food in my pantry..... I may one day even be able to live without the constant undercurrent of anxiety that comes from “waiting for the other shoe to drop....” Sigh..... Even when it REALLY sucks, life IS STILL GOOD.... Keep fighting y’all ❤️
Wow,,,,ima nurse everyone who has come up with acure has been taken out...they take profits from donations. They dont want us alive.
We Love you Tom and your music lost my dad to cancer this song touched my soul !!
How people give a thumbs down to dis song.my step bro died from a brain tumour. ,I thank tom macdonald from the bottom of my heart ❤for writing this great song. It means everything to me an my brother who's gone an in heaven rip love ❤u miss u every day bro 👊
Thank you! I had a suggestion keep popping up to listen to a clip with you talking to Glenn Beck and I finally decided to watch it. I was so impressed that this old lady who has a daughter the same age as you started listening to "rap". If you are "rap" I've been hearing it wrong all these years. You are an amazing poet and story teller. I was bawling listening to Angels and now I'm bawling again. I just received my cancer diagnosis and I want you to know as sad as this song made me, it also gave me hope. Obviously you are talented beyond words but the wisdom at such at young age leaves me dumbfounded. Thank you again, you are an inspiration.
This song hits me in the heart.
Tom is an amazing artist. He attracts people with soul at all ages. I find people who are offended by truth weak and pathetic. Keep creating Tom, the God has a purpose for you, Keep reaching out and  people will get your message.
9/11 cancer survivor, lost my partner to it, fuck this hit home hard.
Of all of your songs, this one is my favorite.  Being a cancer survivor at just 37 years old, thank you for singing this song.
Fight,stand up,United we can do anything.. share like, recommend this man's messages...
I thank god that I have never lost someone around me to cancer but listening to this song and reading these comments literally made me break down. I am not someone to cry, pretty much ever, but the stories in the comments tore me apart
Dude dude.....My heart broke.
Thank you for reminding me.😢
Today at work, I'm listening to all 54 videos in your playlist, and clicking on all the ads 4 you.
🔥🔥🔥
Made me cry.  I am a breast cancer survivor but I just lost my mom to pancreatic cancer.  It is a question of why don't we have better treatment to cure cancer.  We spend so much money on other things.  Eventually everyone knows someone this disease touches.  Love the message that if you get this diagnosis never lose the spirit to fight for survival.  Although with my mom there was a wonderful peace that we had together when there was no more treatment and we just enjoyed the one month that we had.  We laughed even over terrible things.  Thank you.
My father died at 74 from cancer,  my German shepard dog at 9.7 years died of cancer, his head was on my shoulder as I lay on the floor with him as he took his last breath 💔
Thank you for this. My mom fought cancer and won. This song moved me so much. Words can't express how this song made me feel. Tom is a legend.
Judy Mikovitz makes a very strong case from here decades of working in biology and with vaccines but she says that Vaccines are a huge cause of the cancer too. I'm sure it's a combination of vacs, sprayed foods, polluted water etc as you mentioned in the song. I also watched a documentary about how there ARE cures for cancer but the countries with such big pharma influence won't acknowledge them. Also, a few people have come up with cures from time to time in the US and they were killed or silenced.
3.2k ninnies hit dislike.
Man, I have been saying this for years. Thankyou Tom. Imagine if they get a cure for cancer (which I think they already have) Billions of dollars in research, hundreds of thousands of researchers/scientist  jobs and such, gone! They all be like, OK now we found the cure I'm out of a job. They're gonna bleed this disease dry
Man I miss my older brother... died 4 years ago. Cancer took him at 40. Thanks for the song man.
Lost my mom 3 years to cancer. The first part of this song is exactly what I always say after seeing what I saw. We have raised BILLIONS in research money but somehow we do the same dumb shit? We inject ourselves with poison and we hope the person can out last the cancer. There is no money in the cure.. just in the treatment. It's a damn cash cow.  My new question: Why are there so many young kids with cancer today after seeing almost none 3 decades ago? What if it is all the vaccines we inject into our bodies immediately upon birth?
Comment failed to post.
Hey man, love your music. This really hit home. My mom is fighting stage 4 colon cancer. This shit hit home hard. Keep up the good work!
My dad's mom and mom's dad had cancer and they're both clear now
My step mom just went into hospital again.   Never smoked, no drugs, barely a glass of wine.  Third type of cancer.  First ovarian, then gallbladder,  now liver.  Cancer free to aggressive stage 4 in 3 months.  Cant stop listening to this since I found it today.  Saying my prayers for her and all those out there involved with the battle against cancer.
Did 3.2k people really dislike this song?! What is wrong with people?
Dude finding you are an artist has given me hope again in humanity. Keep telling the truth thru music! My thoughts and prayers are with you for continued success!
Amazing song Tom!
Yourba real one tom
I lost my grandmother to cancer. The last time I saw her I said goodbye, that I loved her and I'd see her on X day (can't remember the day). She smiled and shook her head like she always did when we said goodbye to each other. 2 days later I got a call that she had passed. She was a fighter all the way up to the very end and I miss her so very much.
We need to rise up aginst the system  its killing us in so many ways
There is no force stronger than truth 👍
True inspiring and powerful song ! We Love all of his songs! Touching for me as my boy is fighting this cancer battle as I'm typing this, he is a true fighter!💪🕊  Knowing the truth of the matter of deceit  and not being blind nor ignorant to the facts was so much more difficult at first. But The Lord is Good!🙏 The truth of the matter is; There are so many natural options than to do chemo or radiation but of course there's not much money in it for big pharma/dictators So they won't touch on it. It's such a demonic industry, most of the "medical" industry. My son Elijah is 15 and was diagnosed with T cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma 6 months ago.. What is so sad is that it's mandated chemotherapy treatments for children and parents like myself have no choice but to comply or get my children taken away if we are non compliant to the dictator medical industry(big pharma) .  Now this is true tyranny and we have been in it for 6 months and they say 3 1/2 years regardless of his progress..  Oh yeah but did I mention he gets a make a wish.. Like they can keep it just give him a choice or freedom to have toxic poison injected in his port or veins or NOT.
How have i only just discovered this guy a few weeks ago?! His songs are too much truth man... this one hit hard 💪❤️
I get that you are upset, cancer is not a simple thing, though some pharmaceuticals may for sure put treatment behind a paywall, cancer is not something that can be all put in the same basket and cured with the same cure. There are different kinds of cancer. Plus, cancerous cells are cells from your body, that the body itself is not capable of recognizing that they have started replicating out of control, it is hard to target that, because they have no markers, so treatments will mainly target an area where there are cancerous cells, but they will also kill healthy cells, because there is no good way of distinguishing them at the moment, as far as i know, I am not a medical professional. Cancer is not sucks, it is one of the hardest things to cure, if detected early enough that it has not spread everywhere. But there is no they with a magical cure hiding it from us mere mortals. We humans like to think of ourselves as being in control of our lives, that somewhere in our added knowledge we know everything there is to know and we can cure everything there is attacking us, but the truth is, we don't know everything, we don't 100% know what every part of the body does, one day we may know, but life is quite complex, and as covid as proven, we have been lucky so far, all it takes is for an existing virus to mutate a bit and we get fucked. There is still much to learn about life. Hope one day we may have the knowledge to control all kinds of cancer, even the ones in advanced state
Just started following.❤❤❤
I’ve never loved an artist so much. So genuine.
Lost my mom 13 years ago to this monster. She hid it from most of the family, because she didn't want them burdened with continuous thought of her passing. She's with Jesus now.
Dad died of this.  So many relatives.  I think he actually died of unreleased anger.  Anger releases something into the body that poisons more than just thoughts.  I wish he could have let it go and maybe I'd still have him in my life.
Im a 14 year survivor.. this is ALL truth..
Finally listen to this song gave me goosebumps
So true!
Lost my sister in 2010, age 47, to cancer..... RIP, Mary, I still love you more.
You crushed it with this one. Keep it up as long as you can stand it.
Tom thank you for this song. I survived cancer twice.
Song leaves me speechless every time i listen to it! I All i can do is cry from its truth!  Thanks Tom!!
Wow.  I am a breast cancer thriver. Cancers and the “charities” we all have mistakenly donated to, are just big business. I shouldn’t get started on the charity aspect, that’s a hot topic for me.  Just know that all of those charities that say they help the fighter, not ONE of them came thru for me.  I am a new fan and am loving your music.  It seems (from what I’ve heard so far) as if you only speak deep truths.  Amazing.

How the hell does this have 3k downvotes? Haters gonna hate I guess....
Im a cancer survivor since last year and god im proud mental is everything  in these battle ! This song gave me more hope... Tom is awsome! And im praying for anyone of you whos going through this shit!
Lord protect and lead you, Tom ❣️💋
Wasn’t expecting Tom MacDonald to make me cry today but here we are 😭💜
This brought a tear to my eye. 😥
Beautiful song! Everyone has been in that position and if you haven't count your blessings!
God dammit tom stop making a strong man fucking cry everytime i hear this song,  CANCER: RIP DAD, RIP GRANDPA, RIP GRANDPA, RIP MOTHER INLAW, RIP AUNTIE I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH. You all fought so long and so hard.  You almost took my brother but he is stronger  Tom Macdonald 2020: "you get saved by your angels or become one..."  Great song and video Tom and Nova
Damn....
I’m not crying, you’re crying
This so hit home 😪
I miss you dad
Thank you for this song.  I don’t know if you will ever know just how powerful it is! Much love Tom, your the best!
Wow, A wholesome rap that doesn't include a slant rhyme that would make Emily Dickinson roll over, Nice :)
What a beautiful song and so sad at the same time😢   How can any make thumbs down on this😡
Lost my wife in 2017 . We were married 15 yrs . Took care of her at home . God I miss her
Tom, if the truth was told about “cures” for cancer, viruses & diabetes, Big Pharma wouldn’t be able to rule the world...like they do now. Facts.
My mother was diagnosed with AML 2 weeks ago. Just got a call that her insurance doesn’t want to pay for the “magic pill” to go with her chemo infusions...prob bc she is 77 which in today’s world holds no value. “Nothing matters if you don’t have your health...” Truth.🔥💯❤️🙏
My 74 year old mother has  been living with lung cancer for two years now. She won't let them treat her nor tell her what stage she is in. Her siblings mother, uncles and aunts have all died from cancer.  This song is very touching. 💓
Who are those insensitive mother fuckers who hated this song? For real? Damn this world is goin' 90miles straight to hell
I love this song and it hits so close to my heart. I lost my brother 3 years ago to cancer and watched him fight like hell and not let it break him. He the reason why I started a nonprofit in his name  after he passed away as our system is broken as noone should have to choose between having money to cover basic living cost or  paying for treatment ..It makes me so mad they will financially drain people who are literally FIGHTING TO LIVE ....THEY ARE WARRIORS AND They deserve a chance to fight to live and not go bankrupt for it ..THEY DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT 😢
The saddest part of this song is just having 2M views and those 3k dislikes (probably people from some pharmaceutical company?). There is something wrong with those people, disliking a music so beautiful that it should have billions of views.
So true POWERFUL !
I lost my dad to leukemia in 2014, when I was 13. I also lost my grandma and my great grandma to cancer, so this song really moved me to tears. Thank you Tom Macdonald.
Fenbendazole.....look it up, it's sold as a dog dewormer these days but was given to humans in the early 70's. It'll help kill cancer! Theres a YT video, search dog dewormer cancer KOCO...it'll get you to the video watch it. This stuff helped to save my brother. Sounds nuts I know but I beg anyone that'll listen please dig into it.  There's cures, they don't want us knowing.
Im fucking irritated this one hasn't hit more views thank you for talking about the things others run from love you fam HOG ARMY
Tom, I hope you never read this,  but you are truly great.  Don't read the comments,  just keep grinding!!!
3200 dislikes?? WTF??
Med bed's are coming out the end of the year. The cure is being released to humanity. When are you going to come to Spain?  Mental mental music!   I'm gonna lose it.  Grant Welstead..... Spain
Praise GOD
Such great wisdom, from such a young man.
Thanks Tom, I needed to hear this today
Tom it is so refreshing to hear artful music once again. I thought music art was dead.  Every song I have listened to from you has been great.  Keep it up
Wish this song existed 2 years ago, i was 28, very pregnant and diagnosed with breast cancer, sure it would have helped💓 Me and little girl are fine now. I pray it'll stay like this for a while.
Almost brought a tear out. Ur something special that I haven't seen in a while n u restored some fate in me.
I had a class mate whom had a brain cancer it took him on his last journey on the 12 of november 2020. We saw him fight when he was in class with us and we knew he fought when he could not leave the hospital.  One day, the 5th of november he sent us all a text "you wont see me anymore, it got worse." a week later he was gone. He had been fighting this for practically all his life and it finally got him ... Cancer won over him ... But we all made beautiful memories with him.  I dont believe in God .. but may he bless you all ... thanks Tom for this song.
😭😭😭😭😭💜
Wow.. Moved to tears!! Dear Lord, I pray for all those with cancer and their families who are affected by it. I pray for healing and strength! In Jesus name!!!
Peace & Love Tom McDonald
Yo this song gives me hope in humanity
Gerson Therapy...dig deeper
, there's no question your the greatest rapper I was just wondering I know a lot of people grew up with the zitcom saved by the bell just recently screech Dustin diamond has passed away due to small sale carcinoma lung cancer bottom line I just want to know if you'll make a song about screech and his whole career and saved by the bell cast picking on him when the cameras are turned off thanks
Just lost our mom to cancer after she fought for 18 months. Thank you for this song I’m so glad your music and messages found me
I’m a 63 yr old white mom of 3,far from your typical rap listener LOL! But this stands out as different to me. These are lyrics I can actually understand with such an important message. My son is going to be shocked when I recommend him a hip hop rap song for the first time LOL😂
did this make anyone else cry or just me? I LOVE YOU TOM!!!!
Awesome, encouraging to those who need a strong word.
I’m not crying you’re crying!
That covid bullshit take's in millions, but the real killer is ingnored...... Kick Out Cancer!!!!!!!!
My mom was 45 when she found out she was sick, gone at 50. Nutrition education was a joke. Her best choice was poison to fight the poison, which is BS. I was 28. I took care of her as she took care of me. I was making her meals, anything that she could keep down. If I knew then what I know now...She was way too young, she is loved & missed by many people. 💜
There IS something after this... in fact, the afterlife will make this life seem like a dream compared to how alive we will feel there. This life on earth wasn’t meant to be like this. But the powers that be have put us all in chains, some unknowingly. If we, as a collective, keep our minds set only on good things, we can shift our reality. Because the one thing they can’t take from us is our mind. Stay solid, Tom. Keep speaking truth.
I'm not sure if you will actually read this or not but I recently started listening to your words of wisdom and God.  Diet is the key, and you are correct there is a magical green plant that is like a surgen in a pot.  Not Pot.  It comes from holly lands and has been studied by many doctors and scientists.  I have been able to, with help from obviously a wonderful woman, to propigate the healing strain. Feel free to reach out for more information.
Man....real.....this is real.....real
I’m a survivor and love this song♥️
This environment is so toxic.  There are 4 main causes to cancer.  Toxins, pathogens, vitamin/mineral deficiencies, and hormone imbalances.  There are exceptions, but it's rare.  It's usually a combination of 2 or 3 of the above.  Get to the causes and fix them.  It can save your life.  Also, look into Rick Simpson "oil" and therapeutic enzymes and other alternative cancer treatments.  Don't always let yourself get talked into radiation and chemo and surgery.  Research for yourself and become your own health advocate.  Or ask family members if you're unable.    Conventional treatments can be worse than the cancer, or they work but not for long and you're left to be miserable with the side effects.  I'm grateful that there are people who went through it and truly are better, but I will always advocate at least supporting those therapies with natural ones.  It can't hurt to become sufficient in your nutritional needs or to do some detoxing.  In fact, if you do traditional treatments, you'll really need to detox.  If you do nothing but traditional, your chances of survival are much smaller unless you're one of the lucky ones.  It's better to support your immune system.
Just an incredible song.  Diagnosed at 48 and now at 53 living everyday like it could be my last because you just never know.  Tears in my eyes listening this.  What a message !
I have quotes contact me
Year to date Denise 💖💖💖💔💔💔 miss U
My mother told me two weeks ago that they found a lump in her breast. she had surgery just this past week and we're waiting on the pathology reports. Next thing I know, "Fake Woke" drops and now I'm going thru all of Tom's songs and find this one. Its almost too hard to type because I'm so scared for my mom and sobbing like a little kid.  This man has a true gift!! If there are any higher powers out there, please watch over this man and help him to send his message to the world!!
Cry.. Hold it back do what you can dont deny
Holy Shit Bro Goose Bumps and tears wow emotions. Dude. CANCER F'n Sucks....
I just lost my grandma to cancer yesterday I came back to this song I love you grandma I miss you so much I wish I could have one more day with you
They'll never cure cancer even if they find a cure because there's too much money and treating it and looking for a cure
I'm growing a wig for a survivor
I'm a leukemia survivor myself.  It was brutal, but I agree with this message. 3 1/2 years of treatment. Medications that cost thousands that I had to take 17+ pills of a day. So many injections feeling like a a guinea pig. Ever spinal tap I had not knowing if I would end up paralyzed.  The hardest part for me was watching my mom and dad cry. I remember that day so well. I'll never forget having pushing my feelings and emotions aside and putting a smile on my face and somehow genuinely telling them not to worry about me I'm going to beat this. Truly the hardest fight of my life. I lost so many years of friends and friendships because I wasn't allowed to go to school and we move to make things easier on my parents because they needed to be able to get to me if anything happened especially whenever I was out of the hospital.   I got a make a wish somehow I guess they were expecting me to die, but I used it to take myself and my family to Disney world. I wanted to share my wish with my family.   I kept my promise tho and to this day have continued to be cancer free thank God.  For those of you that don't know. You're never "Cured" you're just in remission for the rest of your life. You're supposed to get check ups at least yearly.
There are no good to go to heaven. We are all sinners. Confess sins...be saved by the precious blood of Christ!
Demons are the right word...also Satan. We are weak...but Christ is ever strong!
They created Cancer with toxins in food/air/water. Now they withhold the cure cuz theirs no $$$ in it but i bet they'll make a vacsine for it instead
cancer sucks
Cancer was the hardest fight of my life! You are right, once you’ve been taken to the brink of death, all the material things in the world don’t matter anymore. Just waking up everyday is a gift!
Thyroid Cancer Survivor and lost my dad to Lung Cancer...this song ripped my heart out...thank you for making music and art with meaning! We need more Tom and Novas in the world. God Bless you guys.
Isn't this the truth.  You know damn well they know how to cure it.   To much money in it for them to give up.   Maybe one day the CEOs and big wigs that run the pharmaceutical companies will slowly start to disappear
I wish you knew just how much this song means to me. Ive listened to it on repeat since my diagnosis of Breast cancer last month. I scream the chorus in my truck! ive also had a canvas made with the chorus to hang above my piano as a daily reminder <3  Keep killin it Tom! youre a fuckin rockstar !
This song made me feel sad because my mom has cancer and it mabe me fell how I am so love u tom MacDonald
Cancer is a business - eye know - after chemo & losing a pound of flesh \ 30 rounds of radiation the bill was over 180k
Stop all donations, not a single dime and let's see what happens!
Cancer cells are formed When A human host is exposed to foreign D.N.A and it forms antibodies.  Cultured Aborted Fetal cells called IL lung fiber blasts are found in Vaccines. It's no coincidence Cases of a Cancer have become more prevalent in today's society.
Chemotherapy is the illusion of a cure!. It makes the cancer cells shrink down and relocate. The real cure is Vitamin B17 it's found in Cannabis which is why they fight legalization as it will kill the chemo industry forgoing billions. Don't believe me? There are 3 Main sources of Vitiman B17, cannibis, apricot seeds and Bitter almonds. Cannibis is already illegal and Apricot seeds and Bitter almonds where made illegal for import into the US in 2002, ask yourself why...
Deep !
this song has never hit me so hard, my mom is dying from cancer listening to this had me breaking down into tears so powerful. Love you Tom
Just purchased your 4 pack collection. Thanks!
God bless you man. #Blessings
Your right man. So many Dr's have had their work suppressed by medical industry. Welhelm Reich's orgone chamber being one. You are the man bro!
To be honest, this song hits so different now. Found out my uncle has cancer today and has been given two weeks to live
you can't control when you go but you can control where you go
I just recently discovered you Tom, amazing song and message.  Your music speaks to me in a way I never thought rap could. Keep it up man.
I just started to follow you and Im not much of a Rap and Hip Hop guy  but I love your stuff!  Keep crushing it!  I love what your doing!
My mom passed away in November because of cancer and diabetes and this song hits the spot man thank God I listen to it 💯💯 thank you brother it means alot to those who have lost someone because of cancer. Thanks tom for these songs
Currently my Uncle is in hospice for a massive inoperable brain tumor. I’m immune compromised with mastocytosis so a plane to go during pandemic not a good idea. It just saddens me.
My mother just died tuesday... she had ulcerative colitis and was forced to take Remicade infusions before they would allow her to try an operation...  She had colonoscopies done very frequently her whole life and then they found something that didn't even look like cancer to them at first but turned out to be cancerous... I am genuinely convinced that the Remicade caused it, not sure what to do with it because I doubt there is anything I can do.  My mother was 49.
Thank you for this song. I, too, am a cancer survivor. The scariest thing is to hear you have cancer, no matter what stage. It feels like a possible death sentence. Mine was stage 3. And even though I am a 65 year old great grandmother, I am really loving your music. Thank you again.
This helps so much man, sometimes its hard to get the feelings out but this helps, my moms in between the hospital and hospice and nursing home god i love her but cant even see her cause of this covid
You are a legend Tom. A beautiful soul
This is such an awesome song. Tom you have mad skills,  but I am sure you knew that because you have been doing it all on your own and making it
100% cannabis oil for brain cancer . you need to cut out or lower your  sugar . alkaline   ie  take baking powder  cancer needs need acidic  environment   to live .  love and peace tom your a real hero
Such a powerful message.  Thank you for speaking truth.
I lost my dad to stage 4 pancreatic cancer it’s the worst feeling in the world to do everything just for it to fail. Cancer is the worst thing In the world I just wish it never existed
This video should have over 1 BILLION views..
Cells become cancerous when deprived of oxygen.
Your a true legend pal. Keep doing what you do!
cuz the insurance companies decides who dies with all diseases. ...its fukd ...and we get no choice...   its cool for TOM  to show love and awareness but this one so true..... but pharma too greedy to ammend it.
RICK SIMPSON OIL. CURES CANCER. GOOGLE IT. PEACE.
They have a fucking cure but the drug companies keep taking great people to court to stop it so they keep that money rolling  Because that's all they care about!!!
Did she live??
My aunts been fighting for 9 years, I watched my uncle pass to this shit. This song broke me man!
Wow    Wow!       Wow!!
those are not tears... my eyes are sweating....
Correct speak the truth tom mac realest to the core aussie luvs      u
Lost my son, my dad, and a friend to cancer, and had advanced cancer myself. This song brought tears to my eyes.
Thank you tom. I'm glad you made this.
Shit bro... my mom is two time survivor of breast cancer. Straight real talk as usual! I’m crying right now!
any one notice that the rich dont die from it only poor and the ones that out lasted there usefulness
Thank you..your music gives me hope for the future of my children.stay true to ur message
Thank You!
This can make a grown man cry
beautiful song!  I just lost my mother this month to it .. and they wouldn't even let me see her til the day before she passed!  She fought for 2 rs and the drs completely dropped the ball! I have no respect for any dr or medical staff anymore after seeing the complete incompetence and money hungry attitudes they all possess! Cannabis is a great start in the ending of this awful disease and it was illegal up until a few yrs ago, go figure! Thank you Tom for making this song and airing out the evil business behind this CURABLE disease!
More facts...  This man might just be a prophet...
Haters: GFY.
Thank you for ur songs
There are many chapters after this enjoy every moment while you can.. each life/lesson is fleeting
WOW.. just WOW! Amazing touching song!
Omg this song.. hit .my.heart!!
You touched me to a depth in me I didn't know my lion was there
You will never convince me that in an age when they can clone a sheep they can't cure cancer. $$$$$$$$.
My dad was diagnosed with testicular cancer when he was 14 and he had to go through kemo and all that stuff but this song portrayed actual problems and I just wanna say that you did a great job on this song.
I absolutely love this song, but I cry everytime I listen to it. My mom had cancer, she knew something was wrong but didn't want to go to the doctor, so she waited a year, when she finally went they told her that if she waited any longer, that she would've died. She's still here ❤
.....................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the real pandemic.
Tom you're the best man
I miss my grandmother
What kind of person would downvote this?  Seriously, what are you disagreeing with here?  Keep going Tom and Nova.
I only allow myself to cry every now and again.  It's not healthy to break down too much.  Every few years I have to though.  This may be one of those years..
Tom diff It's a good thing.
The song is pretty powerful, my grandma died from pancreatic cancer. But calling a song cancer and trying to generalize over 100 different cancers into "cancer" doesn't make you seem smart. If you actually studied cancers* before writing this song you wouldn't need a verse or two..
My mom died of lung cancer took her last Breath in front of me  and I just laid next to her and cried I wouldnt let them take her from me even though she was gone. It was a horrible thing to see those 6 weeks while she wasted away and died in front of me, I couldn't and cant handle it. I had already lost my dad at 15 to a motorcycle accident. Still some days I cant handle life not having parents raising kids of my own and they arent here to be with us or know them. I just cant stop crying .
Our health for their WEALTH
Cancer sucks! They told me it was the worst case they had seen. But I'm strong and looked the devil in his face. They said I will see him again but, I will be stronger! Thanks Moffit of Florida
I’m a rock/country guy...One of the greatest songs I’ve ever heard, powerful is an understatement
Fuck cancer and fuck censors. Your message and aura and attitude is spot on Tom. Keep fighting.
I see all the scum bag pharmaceutical reps and trolls came out to dis the truth from this song.   Tom awesome song keep up the great songs and speaking the truth...
There is no if or where I will go , I know.
Lost a great friend of mine to bladder cancer three weeks ago. He was 29.
It almost made me cry tbh
I'm crying bro.  I'm buzzing right now.  I'm talking to God.    He loves everyone.   You're motivation is amazing.  Never stop , you're waking more up
I don't know why but I needed to hear this song. Thank you.
I want you to be exposed to the world. I listen to everything you publish and feel I could have been you, but didn't follow my calling and am proud you did. If tears aren't pooled, listen again.
U nailed it!
You say what most think.  Lost most of my family to different cancers and we all know there is a cure!
WOW!!!
Great song and great message man keep it up
Wow just wow. My prayers for all humanity and for Tom. You are doing God’s work on this planet. I am glad and feel blessed 🥲 you are here making your music 🎶   United we stand divided we fall. We must come together.
Dang, you can tell he cares and loves his family, and takes life lessons and put them in his songs.
Just discovered  this man's music  and I got to say I love every song.
WTAF.  Crying?
My mother is having ongoing treatment for stage 3 breast cancer. Hopefully in the next year or so we get good news that she's in remission.
Cancer Survivor here! Thank you for this!! ❤
This is fucking beautiful
Awesome
I've lived this life for 47 years.. Tom, you spitting reality that is unmatched.  God bless you. I've never been more inspired.  You crazy yo! Be safe
Made me cry man 😥 Thank You and Good Job!!!
#FIGHTER #ImGoingToLoveYouThroughThis
My family has been devastated by cancer. This song hit me in the feels big time. Tom your extremely talented and an old soul. Keep dropping truth brother.
Truth. This gives me hope for music... if there is divinity looking after this world and it’s creatures... it feels like it’s channeling through Tom. Please stay true to yourself and if you are touched by any illness like Cancer know that your not alone and others care. If there is any divine being.... please have mercy on your children.
Wow 3.2 k idiots who thumbed this down, what kind of evil person would do that. Its literally an anthem for people who fight cancer
Pancreatic cancer..... lost my husband. I was only 49.... Keep speaking truth and continue your authenticity 💜
fuk in awesome
Tom if you knew how true this song.  I have stage 4 colon cancer that has metastasized To the liver.  The chemo is pure hell but I want to be strong for myself.  Thank you once again for putting out the words we are looking for.
Such a deep song! We have lost a lot of friends and family lately due to this disease. This truly touches a lot of people! Thank you Tom for speaking out about this!
cant believe this didn't get more traction
this song means so much thank you for talking about it much respect keep up the good work
Thank you so much for saying The Truth n nothing but The Truth. I lost My Dad in 2009 to the ugly C word...
We’ve donated about 4.9 billion.
Hey you are my new favorite artist I love ya bro
God damn I've never listened to an artist so emotionally affecting ever.
Amen! I say the exact same thing!  I will not donate a dime to cancer foundations! CURE PPL!
We're filling coffins with dollars* I work in pathology, I live off those dollars. I don't know* Its biopsy, I process it, I get paid. I don't know. I've worked with biopsies from my aunt, uncle, my grand parents, my wife. I don't know. The biopsies keep coming and so do the pay-checks.
OMG rappers rap about bitches & cars. This is art...
I came into this world just like every little boy and girl as expected two loving parents who wanted there own lil family planned it now dont get it twisted growing up was all fun and games till it shifted went from great to worse  in less time then expected  let me break this down for a few seconds first off heres a lil backround some of yall can relate too my old man was in the military traveled the world and did his duties mom dukes was the house wife raised her two kids without thinking twice  just when things was going as planned had a big house two car garage and a minivan  brother fell ill with a sickness none of us could understand but as a family we stand together he beat his cancer from bed ridden paralyzed and damned to up walking living the best life he can with side effects you probably wont understand  then just when we thought we was in the clear after all that has happened lightning can and did struck twice in the fam  yeah it was my turn to feel the burn from all the treatments and heartaches sleepless nights and bed pans see theres a difference between his sickness and mine you cant see his but damn if you cant see mine  i can remember it like it was yesterday it went from the Doc saying take your son to the hospital fast as you can to sorry to be the one to say this but i dont have good news for you so you gotta choose i looked at the doc without hesitation and made my choice with a 9 year old voice My old man couldnt understand how quick this young man had a plan  see life doesnt always go as planned, you gotta get up say Fuck you Cancer I got a Plan Not you nor the obsticles in my way i dont give a damn  Now im grown looking back at the past after all the shit Me and the Fam been through doesnt even compare through the shit i gotta jump and swim through on a daily Rest In Peace Pops we Miss you  Respect and Love to Mom Dukes and all the things she had been through to raise her sick ill boys  mentally too  Dont need no sympothy, no your so inspiring, no tears flying, no boohoo hoo If anything send those Positive vibes my way without a blink of an eye imma stand, breath, and move on my way but you already know thats what warriors do  Be positive for others but most importantly be true to you  see life doesnt always go as planned, you gotta get up say Fuck you Cancer I got a Plan Not you nor the obsticles in my way i dont give a damn  With Love I stand Fuck you Cancer I got  a Plan.  Tom and Nova and everyone effected in some way from Cancer 1Love stay strong
I personally think they have had the cure for a while but don't want us to have it because they make so MUCH money from the treatments and keeping people sick. I pray we can all come together as hurting citizens to fight the corrupt system were all living in. We truly are in the matrix. Thanks Tom! Great song!
They can destroy cancer cells w frequecy.. they've know for decades
I started to listen to you after I heard about you on Glenn's show today. I have never liked rap. However I am now a convert and been sharing you music with family. This song had me crying my eyes out. My father has cancer so it hit home. Still a good cry is good for the soul. Looking forward to the new song!
Not been diagnosed yet but I know I'm dying of cancer...but I'm trying not 2 give in and rely on these useless doctors.  I'm just hoping to die on my feet like a man b4 I'm reduced to a useless lump of cells costing my family to much money....im 2 the point where I wish i was brave enough 2 just swallow a bullet and save my loved ones the time and money. I don't have much left in me. It is hard 4 me 2 give up.  I've always been the one who takes care of my family....I can't give in and beg them bc I'm to  weak 2 do this on my own... I'm sooooo lost.
So true. Wow, so true. Your right why is cancer still a major issue 🤔
As of February 4th 2021 there’s 3.2k dislikes....Disgusting...😠 Should be zero dislikes. Much respect and prayers for anyone going through this...Great job Mr. Tom...Amazing song. 🙏🏻👊🏻👍🏻🇺🇸
My mom died 3 years ago from cancer after fighting for 5 years and defeated it twice just to die from it the 3rd time
simply Simply Beautiful send straight to my heart in a time of division in sickness may we all come together and at least defeat that with love
GREAT!!!
Wow! This song has touched my heart. My brother died from colon cancer a few years ago. Then my father has survived esophageal and lung cancer. I personally have had 3 types of cancer and am facing a fourth type now.
New to your music.  This one touched me more than all of the other songs that got me to this point.  Damnit.  Keep up. Keep strong.  Keep smiling.
I told someone this along time ago and to this day I still say it I would give anything for God to give me the cancer from every person on this earth and let me die in their place people dont deserve to go through what that stuff does to you
I agree with him 100% the only reason a cure for Cancer has not been made is because of one small symbol ......   $<---and that is it.....a human life is worth more than money
Thank you for this.
i HAVE TO BELIEVE AND FEEL IN MY HEART THERE IS A BETTER PLACE THAN HERE.
I was with you with the first song of yours I listened to, but now I'm going to follow you for this song. This is my kind of song. It speaks about important things, while reminding us that even when it's hard we're stronger than we expect to be. It's an important message, and one that is missing in this age of negativity and hatred. It's the best thing I've heard since Muse's Survival.
I didn't think the song would hit me to the point of almost crying, even though me and my family had nothing to do with cancer ever. Of course I can't imagine how do people affected by cancer feel, but I'm sure this song will tell them not to give up on live. I have so much respect for you, because you can sing about things that are important in life and you prove that money and bi*ches are not the only things rapper should include in his/her songs.
RIP to all the cancer fighters. I  lost my dad in April 2020 with non hodgkin's lymphoma.  Cancer sucks as we all know, watching someone we love suffer and deteriorate right before our eyes. Thank you for making this song it hits home with me and for everyone else who had to deal with this disease. Praying for everyone who is fighting.
I'm from the UK, the NHS or national health service gets criticised and isn't perfect, I'd rather our system than rely on an insurance policy, the USA has the 5 best hospitals in the world but few can afford the care they give.
he's just spitting facts you can't deny it either also I went through cancer and beat it
Fuck Tom! This touches 😧🧨❣️
Absolutely beautiful song! Cancer has wiped out half my family members!
I lost my mum to cancer she was 48 😥😥 2 years later my mum's sister died with cancer a year later my mum's dad died of cancer 😥😥 still haven't got over losing them, song means so much thank you.
We need to stop believing the “white coat priest class”. Build your immune system. Avoid anything that’s not organic even if you have to grow it yourself. Filter all of your water.  Everything IS toxic. Especially the new “wonder jab”. Do not trust the new “priest class” it’s run by luciferians.
The song is a pure reflection of our reality with cancer.
Wow. Thank you for this
You are so inspirational. Thank you. 💓💓💓💓💓💓
lost my mom 2 years ago to cancer . Her second round of cancer the dr. told her she was stage 4 and only had six months. She lived another 2 1/2 years. The entire fight she was more worried about her kids than herself. Even when she was place into hospice care she was more worried about use than herself.  She would of loved this song.
the most effective prevention of cancer is regular ketogenic feasting. cancer cells are runaway cell dividing with high metabolism. very low blood sugar levels starve them and can prevent em getting serious IF they occur
Man this dude touches on everything thats REAL, FACTS AND LIFE...wow
Great song! God bless 🙏
Live like you dont know what Cancer is- Fight it if you have it& pray theres something after this.................
FUCK CANCER- please pray for my mum- Amanda Smit <3 .......................
I hope none of you all have to experience this battle....  2 years into remission and this man has me balling my eyes out.   Keep fighting warriors ❤️
Tom MacDonald is peerless his other songs are jaw dropping equivalent the all four of the Beatles take over music and the British invasion on truth.
Cancer... Funded by the big pharma
👍💯
You nailed that one Tom. Thanks for that. The days ARE hard. The nights ARE long. But lyrics like these take the edge off.
My mom died from Cervical Cancer, this song hits home....shit
Really really good Tom. Good message too!
Mum just died from cancer  yesterday, I guess she's part of the 20% that weren't supposed to live. This song has gotten me through her last months of suffering 😭😭😭
This song from Tom is just another example of how he writes and speaks to people from his heart and soul. He may seem over the top at times but it's his way of trying to wake people up to the truth thru his music. A lot of people on this earth would never take the time to  look past the piercings and tattoos to hear the messages like this one that come from his heart and that's a shame. We as a people need to start looking beyond people's color, looks, and flaws to see the good in each other and realize that in the end no matter how much the media and the government try to keep us fighting among ourselves that we are all brothers and sisters. If we don't start standing up for each other then who will. The politicians sure as hell aren't worried about us whether they be republican or democrat. They speak and make promises to gain power and control. Tom speaks from the heart to anyone willing to listen to try to make us all wake up and realize that whether it be cancer, racism, poverty or anything else we have the power to overcome it if we all stand as one. This song is just another example of the depth of the man that's behind the lyrics and the kind of heart he has and the love for all people that he has. My father died of cancer a few years ago. I watched him go from a healthy man down to just a shadow of the man he  had been in just six months from being diagnosed with cancer. A song like this makes me feel sad to have lost him but proud at the same time to have watched  him fight for every day as hard as he did when he knew it was hopeless. Thanks for such a beautiful message and song Tom.
We love you so much Tom. Thank you so much. My mom isn’t done fighting yet. She’s stronger in keeping hope than I’ve been in fighting alcohol, but you’ve been healing us both. Thankful for you, I wish I knew you in person you I could say it to your face. Your music makes hurting people cry,  but they’re healing tears, words that make fighting the depression worth it. Wishing you a long happy life.
Great content as usual
Awesome and real , this has helped so much
Dude my mom battles daily ... She loves all your music ..I take pride in hearing her pull up in her car bumping one of your songs..Keep being real and speaking truth...Much love from Nc...
U are so special Tom!
FACTS!!!!
This song pulled some heart strings and im not gonna lie im teary-eyed and it reminded me of the ones i lost, great song man keep it up
Brought tears.  Love you brother
Lost many to this disease. My sweet cousin on 4/20/19 this hit home.
Big hint:  cancer loves sugar.
I watched my mum go through  lots of surgery's for stage 4 ovarian  cancer always got better. Then she started radiation and chemotherapy........ thats what killed her i watched a woman who was so strong destroyed by a treatment that was supposed to give us hope in beating it. You live longer with no treatment im sure much love to all those fighting it and i pray you all come out the other side even stronger  thwn before  x
The thing that’s most wrong is they already have the cure for cancer but it being make them enough $$
I am under going treatment for stage 3 cancer, you have read my hy heart in this song!  I have lost my father and my sister already to cancer.  I am all that is left thank you for giving me my own fighting song!!!
This song killed me before. But now its even worse, last week mt Grams was dx with untreatable cancer. Shes all I have.
I have been fighting for my life most of my life.. But I am currently going through another round of treatment. It is almost like I do not have a choice.. They do not give you much of one. I have your music on my phone and thanks to my brother.. YOU are with me during treatment. It is hard to explain to people how much I hate this shit. But if I say I am done.. I am being selfish. If I say yes .. I just want this crazy shit to be done. Thank you .. Today I am struggling.. And I appreciate you and your words!
Your messages are truly inspirational and motivating. Real art inspires others and that is what you do. God Bless
This is so much truth in the lyrics it makes me cry...thanks...i just found ur songs today and it helps thru this shit.
Guys he's trying to tell you. They have the cure for cancer, but they will not let us have it because it would destroy their money machine.
Balling 😢😢😢 Thank you this really hit home
22 years.. 22 years I haven't listened to rap by choice or heard a good song that was worth it.. I grew to hate rappers, talking about their cash, hoes, money, bling and how many other sad individuals they 'clapped'.. and then YOU come along and change my views, Tom.. thank you for your words of truth; glad to have you with us on this diseased planet; I hope that we will break our fever soon and we'll all start to feel better, and that you and me live to see that day.
@Tom ... Bruh.. I am balling.. Being an  empath .. Wow.. I almost feel mad at myself for taking so long to discover you... Growing up in the 90s poor and all of my family dying left and right and the rest left well.. Yeah... But this song ... Wow.. I need to meet you and shake your hand.. I started rapping in 2012 because nobody was making MUSIC ANYMORE ... ESPECIALLY RAP... -... YOU AND MESUS ...AND THE few True to God warriors will take this System and rewrite it for a better future for the later .. That 95 % of people may not even care.. .. Anyways.. Idk if you read these word for word.. But You Dax and Mesus .. Are all in ur own ELITE ... And EVERYONE ELSE... Well they know they puppets... Tom .. Much love.. I personally will pray for Gods Hand to light that fuse... And i cannot wait til aug .. I need to finish my first LP.. ..🙏💯
Tom just broke me with this song. I'm completely undone.♥️
Over 3,200 people dislikes tells you how much they love others to have cancer.
There's a cure. If they cure all the illness then big P would not be able to clean up. It's about money and pop control. Cancer is made to control and steal.
Any dislikes mean they didn’t get it! So dumb
I've lost many family members and a few others to cancer, this song is hard to listen to in a good way I've avoided comments until now on this track but long story short thank you Tom, you help those in the darkest places and are more relatable than any other artist I've listened to
Thank you for your music... We need it
Imagine being a garbage human hating this song.
This made me cry. Great song. My best friends mom is at the ends of this 8 year struggle. Jesus is on the other side. We have nothing to fear. We will see each other again
My dads beat it 3 times. I’m a nurse and don’t want to sit at his bedside again, praying, crying alone in the bathroom so he doesn’t see, making deals with God, making him laugh to hide my fears, holding his hand while he sleeps, waiting on doctors (doctors I know... I’m not a nurse but a daughter dammit) then grateful to get good news. Big Pharma FUCK YOU... we know you and one day we’ll BEAT YOU instead of you letting cancer beat us!!!!      🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻 Dad 💪
Who the hell give all the dislike just listen to the lyrics what he is saying and if all this happen with ur family then only u will know guys. Support this song so that
Absolute chills
My brother had cancer when we were little he battled it off and on for 9 years he died at 16 after his bone marrow transplant. My kids never met him but they know they have an uncle to meet in heaven one day.
When I was 15 you couldn't get anyone to listen to such a positive message, not even me, but not nearly as many were awake to the fake media back then, so the millions of views & huge majority of positive comments on these songs is proof enough for me, things are changing, slowly, but definitely changing, good on ya there Tom
The cure to cancer is using food as medicine
You’re going to save people with this song. Much love 💚
If you look at the rise in vaccinations and cancer the graft almost lines up with each other. Vaccines give rats cancer. They just call it safe because only an acceptable amount of the rats get it. This bubble wrap society is going to kill itself this way... maybe that's what they want
Ever time I hear this song it helps me deal with my sickness. Cancer is hard to live with. Lol my kids think you wrote this song for me. Because of how you speak you help them know there not alone and that they’re not the only ones with a sick Dad. Thank you! Makes me cry every time.
This song hit different. My six year old daughter is a brain cancer survivor
🥺 this song would hit home hard to so many.
Almost lost my wife to cancer.  Hits hard
My sister had Thyroid cancer, and my dad had Prostate cancer.  Both have had surgery and are in remission. I don't know what that means for me.....I just lost my Great grandma to possible Pancreatic cancer complications as she refused treatment. Maybe that was the 1 in 3.....but who knows.
How could anyone be downvoting this?
This song is really helping me right now. Thank you from the bottom of my heart ! 💜
My 5 year old son has leukaemia, its hard
Had pancreatic cancer in 2016 chemo wasnt working, i about gave up then the doctors in Orlando told me about a trial drug so i jumped on it, and after 3months i was cleared!! But tom is right!! Keep spittin facts bro!
Dang , I crying my eyes out, love it
We can know where we go when we die
Started off over a hour ago because i heard of "Fale Woke" and now this rap about something that has effected eveyone in some way.  Stay just the way you are, truthful and not afraid to let everyone know.
GMO OMG, Food Inc, Fat sick and Nearly dead. These movies changed how I will eat forever. I was 340 lbs at the beginning of this year and I have lost almost 30 lbs just changing my diet and eatting a bit better.  Those movies are proof our Gov here in American does not care about the people. Just keep them feed, fat, complacent and quiet.  Be the cog and don't make noise.   As a black man in America I fully respect the heart and energy you put into your vids Tom.  Never stop speaking that truth.
Honest , bs exposing rap ❤
Someone was chopping Onion while I watched this video.😿
Deep, I felt this
I'm 45 yrs. old and no longer sad at the cancer deaths (my dad and several aunts/uncles suffered before passing), but mad, at the scum with ill-gotten gains deciding who lives and who doesn't. I've been telling my wife for years exactly what Tom conveys in this song. BILLIONS of dollars, decades of "research" and....nothing.
Dad died of cancer in 2012. Superman does have a weakness.
I cried the whole way through this video
My woman started with pancreas cancer and now has bone cancer in her hip, I love her. she's a strong woman, she doesn't think she is but she is so beautiful, and so very strong. I don't want to her to go through what she goes through anymore, if I could take it from her and bear it myself, I'd do it without a second thought, she deserves a peaceful, pain free life.. I ain't religious.. I'm not even that superstitious... but if there is a afterlife, I'm going when she decides to go, and I hope to hold her while we cross over.
Wow chocked back 😭 watching this, you absolutely ROCK Tom!!! God bless you!🙏❤️
Thanks for this song. I lost my father late 2019 from cancer. When I was in the hospital with him and my uncle, one doctor came in and said he need to do chemo. And that doctor thought we all didn’t understand English, but I was born in the US and spoke to him. Seem like he just going to the protocol and didn’t really want to help. Sad part was that he’s also Vietnamese just like me. But didn’t know how to speak his own native language. Basically he was belittling us.
Beautiful! Made me cry.
Didn't know if I wanted to share but the song was so powerful. I lost my baby brother when he was ten years old. Nearly forty years ago this next Christmas. Thank cancer for that pain. Lost my father eleven years ago this month. Remission times two. Third time was a charm. Thank cancer for that pain. I'm now working on five years cancer free. A life now filled full of medical issues. I want my sight back the way it was. Thank cancer for my daily pain.  FUCK CANCER!!!!!
I have an Aunt going through cancer, she was in the clear for just a short time. Maybe 2 months when she was told it was back stronger than before. I was playing this song and she just started crying. I told her she is a fighter... She had to sit down for a moment. Tom MacDonald makes music that helps other people
Cures have been in existence since the early 20's everything is being suppressed.  The powers that be ban potential cures.  some people believe that Cancer is a survival mechanism in an overly acidic environment in which the cells mutate and become cancerous in order to survive. The food that we eat is basically poison and preservatives,  if you read the ingredients in our food you'll notice we eat a TON of acid.  Adding baking soda to your water could theoretically bring your PH back into alignment and potentially cause the mutated cell to return to normal.  I have read cases where diet doesn't end up working, sometimes prayer is the only option.  Please note, I am not a doctor and I am not giving medical advice.
Thank you Tom,   my mother in law fight with Cancer for 5 years. The Song is so true. It is so hard to see the weaksness. She was always smile and so happy. But every year every week the happiness and smile go away. Greating and a very big thank you from Germany
This is beautiful. The comments are heartbreaking.
New fan why have I not heard of you Tom? Simply brilliant everyone share.
So true my sister died my brother has cancer decades billions of money still no cure.  Oncology is a huge money maker (work in healthcare) there will never be a cure.  Pharmaceutical co, physicians cancer hospitals make too much money.......
My grandmother had breast cancer around 15 years ago. She's been a survive since then and lived to be 80. I have a reason to believe that the medical industry is hiding it because it's not profitable. Think about it. Why cure someone in a day when you treat someone for months and bill them every step of the way.
Beautifully tough song...thank you
This song broke me for real. My mom died of cancer in 06 and I watched as she slowly wasted away from chemo and radiation, took her to every treatment after school, bathed her, fed her, you name it. Money is the root of all evil and big pharma will not let it go with how much they make with chemo and radiation. Big pharma murdered my mom, among many many other innocent loving people.
AS A CANCER SURVIVOR WHO IS FEELING SICK AGAIN I HAVE 0 INSURANCE TO EVEN GET CHECKED ....
Believe is Jesus, He is our only hope
Cancer has taken too many that I loved and then my son was diagnosed last year. 😢😢😢. The treatment killed my husband - after fighting so hard.
Never see someone who talk about realistic things in a lot of issues
👻
Damn, I just found out that Dustin Diamond who played as "Screech" from Saved By The Bell passed away this morning. He had Stage 4 small cell carcinoma cancer. He was diagnosed with this brutal, relentless form of malignant cancer only three weeks ago. In that time, it managed to spread rapidly throughout his system. I grew up watching him on Saved By The Bell and he will be missed...F***k Cancer!
Damn thank you! Every song you have is the truth!!!
I mean, who disliked this song...SERIOUSLY, what is wrong with some people🤔🤦🏼‍♀️
This song.
My heart broke watching this.
I love this song❤
I am a retired nurse and Tom is right. I refuse to support these campaigns.  Find the cause not the cure...
I haven't been brought to tears from a video in a very long time. This is a powerful song surrounded in truth. God Bless
Mom died from cancer she fought it for years seen many people fight cancer this song has a beautiful message we can change our gene expression and life with thought alone so chemo is not always the way if ur sick or suffering with something try looking up dr Joe Dispenza it may change ur life
Just lost my dad to brain cancer this week . I took him to radiation everyday . He had 11 more to go , but God spared him the painful dude effects . He is with Jesus now . This song hits home
Hi Tom I am a 61 yo man, my son showed me your music a few weeks ago.  You  are an amazing artist, maybe the best ever.  I am a music lover.    I have cancer and this song will be my anthem.    Respectfully.  Dan
Ellen G White had the answer
Tom is a HERO. Keep spreading the truth!! We want unity, that's how we'll win against evil.
Me and my sister survived cancer
My husband is a Norwegian. A little over a year ago, my sister-in-law wasn't feeling well before Christmas. She goes to the doctor and diagnosis, cancer. It took 3 months before she was allowed to see the specialist in Oslo. By then, the pancreatic cancer had spread. Now it was too late. They gave her 2 months, she is still here over a year later. Now the cancer is in her lungs. She still fights. They give her now 2 months. She hasn't given up. But she will not be one of the lucky ones. Thank you for this song.

The day I got told it’s stage 4 cancer my world came crashing down. The day I shaved my head was awful. Defying all odds I’m 21 and 15 months cancer free.
Holy SHIT! Totally right about the cancer "treatment" industry. They'll never give us the cure. THey'd lose trillions of future dollars. Everything is cancer causing. They are killing us for profit. Everyone.
genius, nothing short of it.
Since these songs are about the truth and the people that listen to them are seeking the truth, please research The Carnivore diet. Seriously. The Standard American Diet is what is killing us. The Vegan diet will also kill you. Plants are trying to kill you. Meat will save you and the planet.  Diet and nutrition are just yet one more big lie we have been told.
I lost my bestfriend and ex to brain cancer 4 years ago.
Thank you Tom bro. 🤘
...thank you.
My dad passed away a few years ago from cancer.  Thank you for this song Tom its beautiful.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
My grandpa died from cancer... thanks bro 🥺🙏🏻
Anyone who thumbs downed this video... fuck off
My heart breaks. I don’t have cancer but I have an autoimmune disease. I’m now disabled but the state has denied me assistance. I can’t afford my treatment my only other option is to suffer through it and hope someone will hire me like this. My husband works so hard to help me and to afford treatment. I’m a foster mom. My pain limits me from being the best foster mom I can be. Your music is so truthful and I thank God for your strength in your lyrics.
The rapper who kept it real.
3.2k people can go to hell
Lost my mom last March from cancer. I watched her slowly die. We end up finding out she died from an infection that got way out of hand. Also found out the Drs and nurses stopped giving her antibiotics cuz they didnt think it would make a difference. I can't believe how cancer patients are treated. I wish I could get the names of her Dr and everyone that sat and watched what he did. Id love to take something of theirs.
wtf idiots down vote this....
Wow a song exposing one of the biggest rackets ever.  Think about  the billions they have raked in,and still need more. Take your  🎀 and shove it.
Damn!!!  My Big sister was just diagnosed with breast cancer. This hit hard.  Thank you for making a song that we can feel.
Keep speaking man we're listening and feeling every word
He makes a great point about the amount of money donated to cancer research. I have thought this about the water charities in Africa, just to put on water feed for each village is not a big deal. How aster all this time have they not done it? Because it is now a business and solving the problem ends the business. Every house in England has it and as you then get a bill keeping the money going 🤔. Look at carona no donations and a vaccine in a few months to get the money flowing again.
Wow where’s this music been all these years? I pray this helps start a cultural revolution against the forces of evil here on earth!   Thank you for helping the masses awake!
Awesome song!!
Donate to us to help find the cure!!! BS they KNOW what causes all types of cancer but they want to keep us sick.
3.2K dislikes...? You fucking kidding me? Probably the people who profit off of cancer..
Wow. Wow. Wow. ❤️love your music so much Tom.
We all going to heaven  just ask....
My mom passed on 4 months ago from lung cancer. This song made me revisit the entire roller coaster of emotions I experienced as my dad  and I took care of her in her final 9 months as the cancer robbed her of everything. To anyone going through it themselves or with a loved one just remember to take it one day at a time and to not take those days for granted.
I have lung cancer stage lV and I'm been on chemotherapy for 4 months and now i have to under go sugery twice...and than radiotherapy...this song tells the truth
My Nan died from cancer.  I had dinner at hers one Sunday, she was fit and healthy, few days later we got the news, 2 weeks later she passed. It all happened so fast, to see her from healthy to being in hospital 😞 I went to visit her, told her I loved her, next day she passed away. Keep your loved ones close.
My mom passed to cancer xmas eve 2019. My brothers and I listen to this song and talk about it all the time. It means a lot to us. And the f cancer. Thanks Tom.  Just ordered and album and tshirt tonight. Wish I could support more but I’m sharing your shit everywhere. 🥰
I have fallen in love with your messages!!!!!!   You truly are one of the greatest.   Be blessed and continue being speaking truth!!!!    Lord knows we all need a voice that is speaking truth these days!!!!!
My dad survived several heart attacks for over 20 years, and he was even dead once for almost 20 minutes. The thing that got him, in the end, was bladder cancer. From the time he was diagnosed until he passed, was less than four months. This is such a horrible, horrible disease and I do believe that the treatments are worse than the cancer. I know there has to be a cure out there, but cancer is a multi-billion dollar a year industry, so if they were to give those who have cancer that cure, they would lose those billions of dollars, and we can't have that. How sad is it that they care more about the money than they do about saving lives? F*%k Cancer!!!
🤘🔥😔 preciate this one bro found out my dads got cancer in the liver shits a bitch this shit hit hard
I never write comments. My dad died from cancer last year. Your song made me cry, in a good way. I just discovered you today....can't stop watching all you videos now. You're good man! I wish you'll see my comment. Keep it up bad ass!
I never really liked much rap over my time listening to music, but every single song I've heard from Tom has hit different than typical stuff. I hope he does well and is blessed as much as possible in his career. Awesome songs awesome guy. Rock on
Man this song hits home thank you!
Kids with cancer are amazing. From the age of 9-12 .... my brother had cancer died at 4yrs old. . I lived those years on the pediatric cancer ward @ Duke. Those kids were so positive, grateful, and fun. The bad days were bad but that experience shattered at the social conditioning for me. Quit highschool and stayed high until 24 years old, I didn't want a damn thing the system was selling. Today I'm free, drug free, debt free (because I didnt go to school) close to off the grid designing gardens and landscapes, no boss, just me and my girl modest existence, good friends, and no bullshit.
Google DOG DEWORMER AND CANCER.....  CANCER IS A LIE...
3.2k dislikes ? How they can dislike this ❤🤔 This is I incredible
Appreciate it support n efforts, grateful to of had u as a part of my world,I hope ur days are blessed
My wife has Cancer for the 2nd time. This time its Stage 4 Metastatic Rectal Cancer. Its a horrible disease. I love this song. Much respect to Tom McDonald for his artistry.
Everytime i listen to this song all i can do is cry i have had a long hard battle with cancer and i am a fighter i kicked it's ass 3 times in 5 years and I'm still here thank you for this beautiful music that hits me right in my soul everytime you give me hope and strength to keep fighting for a better tomorrow
👍👍🎉🎉😍😍
"You don't know what you can take, until you realize you didn't break"
My mom Deanna Simmons died of cancer, 4 different cancers bro. She died the 25th of this month. She wasn't promised this long. This song has helped so much. My family said fuck cancer as we sent her our messages from earth to heaven. I thank you Tom. Your my biggest inspiration bro. Keep growing.
After covid. This song just exposed the globalist and corruption of our world. Shut down economy to cripple small business for the flu....but allow beer, fast food, gas stations, and weed shops to stay open which all cause cancer but that's not important....only covie 19.....got it. All political theater to eliminate one man Trump that exposed em all. All politicians. How as Americans both left and right be not storming together to dismantle our corrupt government. #cancerpatients #want #the #truth #we #the #people #vs #united # communist #government #of #america
My sister is fighting breast cancer, and my dad died of lung cancer last year. I tear up every time I hear this 😥
Shit this hits hard my mum has had cancer 8 times never had to have chemo luckily but she’s only 50 she got her first cancer when she was 20 I think she was in the Australian Army at the time so they paid for it but since then she’s had a few different cancers and a few strokes and a heart failure and she’s still kicking strong but fuck this song hits hard mum got cancer twice a couple months after my dad died and they scared me more then anything
Not sure why but I can only watch the first 5-15 seconds of this song before it buffers infinitely.
Cancer survivor here. My mom is currently battling two different cancers completely unrelated and possibly a third.  Update: my mom's best friend, who has cancer, isn't expected to live more than a week, maybe just a few days.
Man after the second Corus I remembered my grandfather who past away from a brain tumor in mid 2019 and just burst into tears. Shitty part is that he was treated for many things and they said he had cancer then didn't like 5 times before he had a stroke which doctors suspect was caused from the tumor after they did a cat scan and found it at which point it was too late as it was at the final stage.
WOW! I AM A FAN NOW
Such a powerful song for the powerless to draw strength from . Thanks Tom for giving us hope .
This song has more than one meaning which makes it amazing and good for alot of people
I needed this. I had surgery and still have growths my surgeon went mia 2 years ago. I'm scared
My cousin had cancer twice and ended up dying by tripping on her cord....I wish I could share this without rebreaking my families heart. I am so sad. I can't share
❤️
Today makes a month since my son died from brain cancer. They gave us the news that he had 2 months to live just before this video came out. It really hits hard today
I am so sad😩😩😫
Fvck!! This bring memories when I went to USA because I needed to be with my mother who suffered end stage liver damage and she needed transplant ASAP! While waiting for a donor It came to a point where there so much hopeless .. but eventually a donor matched and she’s now doing ok . I feel for every body that is in this situation . You are strong !!
my oldest daughter at the time age 2 now shes 5 had brain cancer. as a mom this hits so close to home as all you wanna do is cry and yell and scream to the world why your kid! why when you did everything right. she gets cancer. All you can do is pray and pray and take her to see many drs all saying shes fine but as a mom you know something is wrong. finally she got the one nurse saying something isnt right and got a dr to look more at her, did a CT scan she had suffered hydrocephalus, she got emergency shunt surgery. (all this while i had a new born baby aswell so single mom we both stayed by my oldest daughters side through her journey) the next day learned she has brain cancer. they couldnt even tell me a child life worker gives me books on "so your child has cancer" i was also a personal support worker so i was my daughters nurse aswell. she wouldnt let anyone do anything but allowed me to. its so hard pinning your kid down to make sure they get the bloodwork done, iv in her hand etc. so many sleepless nights, i turned her room into a second bedroom with stuffies, dvd players, etc to help her out, she wouldnt eat the hospital food etc i would get her, her fav food, snacks etc something she can keep down. it hurts watching your child struggle iam so happy the dr managed to remove all of it and shes 5 now still gone. now my 2yr old  almost 3 has a cyst on her brain </3 might be a round 2 journey... </3 CHILDHOOD CANCER NEEDS MORE AWARENESS
R.I.P grandma I miss you everyday. I also lost my cat punkin to cancer last year. Fuck Cancer!
this song is very inspiring
Cancer can be cured... I have information on dr's,  clinics,  treatments,  supplements.. no chemo, no radiation, no surgeries.. i want nothing in return my dream is to start a nonprofit organization that will help families find the right dr's,  clinics and then cover the cost of those visits and treatments 100% but for now all i can offer is the information
True song, have a mass in my brain.... See what he saying, so I refused treatment cuz I'm living, not dying... We all have a due date... Mine just has a lable on it!! Thanks Tom, I'm a fighter, and living my life, not dying at the hands of doctors who have no clue or cure.
I suffer from lower intestinal cancer and colon cancer and ulcerative colitis I don't know if you know any of those terms but means a lot here in your music hope to see you one day
I'm a survivor. And the person that pretended to be you is a c********** I'm sorry that you're so busy but I am a survivor and I like to meet you one day before I go it's my only wish love you Tom McDonald
💕💕💕💕💕💕
Thank You Tom. I needed to be reminded. Everyone sees there pain and feeld bad but forgets to tell them they are strong. I have to say it to my MOM a lot to remind her and myself that she is strong and will get thru this cancer like she has so many times before hopefully this one doesnt break us.
I lost my brother to esophageal cancer today. He loved this song.
“Fight it if you have it and pray that there’s something after this”- that part slapped
Tom is the voice that alot of us need ,I would not have came to certain decisions without listening to him and then wonder and then I actually get the urge to look it up myself n educate myself
My nana had cancer she was one of the lucky ones she shriver sorry for people who die from cancere
My father in law just lost the hardest battle anyone ever fought.  He was one of the strongest men I have ever known and this disease ate him away to nothing. every breath I take right now feels like my heart is being ripped to shreds, I can't even imagine what my wife is going through.
There IS something after this!  It isn't the good that go to heaven and the bad who go to hell for we are ALL sinners! If it were, we would all go to hell. “Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God alone." Luke 18:19 NIV https://luke.bible/luke-18-19
remember when Mac Lethal said Tom wasn't controversial? yeah, so I think Sir Cumrag here got the wrong impression from that
This hit home for me.. I have lost loved ones and I myself am going through the battle at 34 with 2 babies it's scary.. its hell.. thank you I loved this song
Bless the babies
For Melissa and Daddy and Darlene Sweet  and her Momma and my baby who survived.
Beautiful song!
Listen to the Bible when you are free.
Hi Tom my father died from brain cancer in 2019 and I just want you to know you nailed it this song does speak the truth about it all thanks for what you do Tom you do it well
Hit me hard my mums a surviver!
Tom you are the best song writer we have had in ages... #legend
3.2 thousand lefties voted this down.
R.I.P MOM OCT 5TH 1960 - OCT 23RD 2014 BRAIN CANCER TOOK HER!
Hits so close to home. My brother had bone cancer at 10. Beat that thanks to a new surgery back then. At age 14 he had lung cancer twice. He beat that thanks to them taking huge pieces of each of his lungs. He was told he would never see 16. He is now 27. Biggest worry is that some form of cancer will take him from us. Cancer has taken my uncle, great aunts and uncles. Now my husband’s step father has stage 4 cancer. This is his moms 3rd husband. She lost her second husband to cancer back in 2001. I pray everyday for everyone who has been touched by cancer in some way.
my old man and I are best of buds.. he calls me brother, not just son.. I don't know how to tell him ill be dead before he goes. This song helps.. But the spill I give to him?
Que hermosa canción 🥺😭😭
keep goin man you are the chosen one from above
Appreciate you bro. 💯
Tom, you are a blessing to so many. I do not have cancer (I have progressive kidney failure), but I donate to St. Judes in the hope that it will be used wisely to help those that have it worse than me.  This song hits the heart. I am in tears because there are so many people, especially children, that are struggling with something that seemingly should have been irradiated by now (at least some or perhaps most of it).
#Fuckcancer... Still Fighting! Great song Tom.
The best of all time Tom, i love all your songs for the sense they make.
I wish my buddy that died in elementary school could have heard this song
Every time I hear this song, hits so hard for me, my father got diagnosed with brain cancer last year in March, he's still fighting strong, thank you so much for your music skin
You hit nails on the head Tom. It would be a privilege to  ever meet you in person. 😎
Research. .the real nature science. Câncer is fabricated.
🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻🇿🇦
This one had me crying. Beautiful.
Lost my dad in 2013 from Brain cancer, he worked around metals his whole life (deemed safe) our towns water source from a lake surrounded by metals in the mountains around it (deemed safe) .. he did chemo/rad and had 3 brain surgeries. He made it 10 years purely because he was a freaking bad ass country boy who was not about to go out on their terms.  he was in remission for 3 years and it came back... He said no more. He was going out his way, so he stayed busy and moving and ornery and died 6 months of no treatments.  He was always sure that the cure had already been found. I firmly believe it has, but treating it just makes them too much money to cure it.   Much love to TOM
As someone who lost my dad to leukemia. Cancer isn't a single enemy. It comes in many different forms. The deeper we dig into each type the more questions than answers that arise.
Song is the truth, my mother beat cancer with zero chemo zero radiation. 100% diet and health, minus surgery for a tumor. 5 years later though, no signs of cancer.
Tom, is the black Dr the guy who was on the show The Selection?
My mom has just been diagnosed with cancer for the second time. I love this song.
Miss you sgt resler save a spot up there for me gramps
There's no money in a cure only in treatment...
fuck your opening lyrics, and your entire message. - "I swear that cancer has a cure but they're refusing to make it"  .... um, no.  It's a serious disease that everyone wants to cure.  It's an extremely difficult medical challenge. That's it.  If you think it's all about the $$$ --- Hospitals don't make much when people die.
Thank You
The 2 best people that i have met battled cancer. One of them was my favorite teacher in highschool, the other a neighbor. The neighbor was the most positive and caring neighbor i have ever met...
Just found out my father has colon cancer,  its in his liver and a spot on his spine that they are looking at today, just found all this out on my dam birthday.
As a 3 time childhood cancer survivor, I appreciate this song 🥰 also 100% agree with. I’ve thought they had a cure for years.
This is what my memoir is based on. So much truth in this song.
Hey brother I'm a cancer survivor had stage four cancer 1990 I love you man and God bless you and I I think it's great song Me and your touch bro
Lost my dad to cancer when I was 15.. when I played this song in my car just the other day my brother told me to play something else.. for all these years, all I had in mind is the words, " if only..." Tom you speak facts always....🙏
That was impressive asf!
Tom, can I use this as my Relay anthem this year in Relay for Life of Second Life?
This will touch so many people
Love this song! I could listen to it on repeat. I lost my dad to cancer in 2012. Great video Tom!
this hit so close to home .
If only every sold music industry little puppet rapper was so brave and clever as Tom....
You sir are a beautiful human
You are awesome Tom thank you so much I feel we have the same views from your lyrics 😊we are the same in so many ways thank you sir
I lost my dad may the 11 1987 it was the hardest thing i ever had to do was to see him go down to 78 pounds to see it eat him up RIP i will always love you
The medical industry is all about money. Do y’all realize how much they get for “helping” people that have cancer
Blows my mind at all the dislikes for this song. Lotta pro Cancer folks out there
my grandpa has leukemia and he is 81 years old I have devoted my life to help him everyday I love him very much he is a fighter thanks Tom for the music sing
Makes me prowed to be white it's ok to love yourself and who you are all lives matter
The story of Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski is proof of the government keeping patients sick. If a doctor finds a cure to any terminal illness, they are a danger to the FDA it seems. Can't make money off people who are not sick.
I just hope if I lose my battle. my mom will get the support she needs
I just had surgery for my cancer and am now currently going through radiation. I don't even have money to buy a wig to cover my bald head. I guess at least it's winter so I can cover it with a beanie lol. The type of cancer I have will come back one day it will be very aggressive. But I did the surgery for my children so I have a few more years with them. Thank you so much for making this song Tom and Nova. It means the world to me.
We can heal cancer with our own Hands... Big Pharma doesn't want you to know... Emotions effect your body.. deal with your Emotions=Energy in Motion
A WHOLE FOODS VEGAN DIET  is one way to prevent it and it some cases cure it. FACTS!
My cat got lymphoma and 3 days ago today, my wife and I agreed to not put him through chemotherapy and have him suffer anymore..I held him in my arms and told him I love him with every inch of my existence while he looked into my eyes as his vision faded.. I don't give a fuck what the world says about animals and pets. He wasn't just my pet or some cat. He was my other half.. losing him was just like losing a human being to me and the pain I feel from him no longer being here with me today is so unbelievably unbearable.. this song helps me through this terrible time in my life.. thank you so much Tom. You truly have no idea the impact you have made on my life with your music and personality.. HOG forever..
When this song came out I didn't know anyone with cancer or died from it..... Couple months later a mate has been diagnosed with cancer and lost a little girl to cancer   Shits fucked and now I can't listen to it
Awesome song, Tom.  Keep up the amazing work!
My wife's step dad has cancer, this song hits hard, thanks Tom for this, my wife needed this!
I just lost my mother to cancer 3 weeks ago and is the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. She died way too young.
Serious this is true art! And finally someone with feelings! Thank you 🙏
I sent this too my grandpa he has GI track cancer two days later he passed away after I sent him this rip
This had to be a hard song to do. Thank you for this.
I wish I could just hold my mom one last time even if it was for ten minutes
I haven't been listening to Tom all that long. I made the same mistake lots of people are and either judging a book by its cover or forming an opinion based on the hate that ppl are saying. Tom your music is fucking awesome and unique to you. Looking forward to listening to more of your music. The love and attention you show your fans is second to none man fuck the haters keep doing you bro these haters don't have a tenth of your skill, dedication, or ability.... can't wait till this pandemic shit is over and live shows come back because the first show anywhere close to KC I'm there.....#newfanforlife#
As a cancer survivor this song makes me wish for grapefruit sized lumps on my lymph nodes.
I have so many family members going through cancer treatments. This song is amazing
Lost my dad when I was 13 to this friggin disease. All my love to those in the fight and who will keep on fighting. God watch over us.
I wish Oxygen could kill cancer cells ...that'd be so cool ...doctors would go bankrupt
You Say What I Feel Are We The Same Person.... Go Go Keep It Up The REAL World Needs To Hear  You Have A Sweet Side ... Tour Brain Probale Wants To Explode Whit All This You Feel... Lay It Down
Thank you for that song and the message. Your so amazing. God Bless you Tom.
Thank you for that song and the message. Your so amazing. God Bless you Tom.
My mom passed away 4 1/2 years ago from Cancer and now my 24 yr old cousin has brain Cancer 😭 i pray for him and everyone else fighting Cancer! They can cure it but why would they when they make so much money from Cancer treatment.
Again absolutely beautiful!
Population control
I took my girlfriend to every treatment, in 1 year and 4 months I watched the one i loved most grow weak. It spread to her brain, "I have a head ache", That was the last text I got from her in hospice. She told me that she would watch over me when she goes. It was an 2 days after that I arrived to hospice and she was gone. I had spent 16k on every treatment. RIP C***tyl ;(
I watched this song because my cat was just given a malignant tumour diagnosis yesterday. Fukin rips me up inside cause we are super close. Love your work Tom
If it were up to me I would give him all the music awards in the world.
😢😢😢 thank you.
This deserves so much more it’s all true and sad it’s reality to its finest!! Instead of these songs that are meaningless that get so much attention!! My Mother is fighting right now and I’m right by her side and it’s so hard and it’s not easy and I honestly can’t believe the stress it’s caused my family not only do you have to worry about the CANCER YOU ALSO HAVE YO WORRY ABOUT THE DAMN INSURANCE! It’s been a Battle.
It’s funny how they sale cancer out the stores knowing it kill people but that’s not a crime 🤔🥶
Tom's comment section is always wholesome no matter the subject
This should be the theme song for St. Jude's. And it should play on every single station.
No cure for cancer but got a covid vaccine in 6 months 👍 if you believe that bullshit
This hits so close to home. I lost both of my grandparents to cancer in 2012. My grandfather lost his five year battle to cancer 5/9/12 and 9 days later my grandmother died 5/18/12. This is an amazing song. Thanks Tom.
This dude is so inspiring
True but why to this day it's still this way
Still doing Kemo your right we are way past that
@Tom McDonald Great tribute brother! Thank you for lending your voice and speaking up concerning cancer, as I have lost my ability to talk during this long battle, but I'll not be silenced! https://youtu.be/jZ6uaEEZpHc
Lost my father to it, still remember the fckn doctor saying he could 'try this or this...but I doubt you could afford it'. I learned a lot after that loss, especially who my true family was and who wasn't worth the blood in there veins.
My mom was just diagnosed with breast cancer. Her brother also had stage four bone cancer was doing treatment in the hospital but wanted to stop cuz how it was killing him. They gave him 6 months to live off treatment... 5 years later hes still alive and almost cancer free from cbd and weed. I'm hopeful the same works for my mom she's my heart.
Super ignorant message in this song, I am going through chemo and I have read a lot about the history of chemotherapy/radiation and how we got to where we are now. People who think there is a "cure" for cancer are idiots, cancer is not ONE disease it is a giant category of many different diseases that manifest in different parts of the body with only the commonality of abnormal cells that continuously duplicate long after they should have stopped. The reason chemotherapy is so intense is because it targets mechanisms in the DNA and outer cell structures to kill cells in your body. Ideally, it will primarily affect the cells that are duplicating most rapidly - IE the cancer cells. It will also affect many other cells such as those in your mouth and stomach which is why many people get nausea. The ideal "cure" for cancer would have to be a form of chemotherapy that can target a very specific marker of ONLY the cancer cells so that it does not affect the rest of your body, but this is an extremely hard task which is why years of research have not brought us to that point. People underestimate how research, especially medical research, works in the first place. If you need to test how a treatment affects human beings you need a large population and to monitor effects for a long time. It is extremely ignorant to question why we don't have a cure when you probably can not name the mechanism of action of a single chemotherapy drug. As for radiation, once again it is another manner of killing cells. You HAVE to kill the cancer cells. All it takes is one cell for you to relapse. I am sorry for everyone else who had to go through chemo treatment, personally, I have acute lymphoblastic leukemia which I know is not a very lethal form of cancer for my age group. I feel very strongly for those who have terminal cancer and are not left with options. However, spreading misinformation and the idea that the "treatment is worse than the disease" is utterly ignorant and will not bring us any closer to helping anyone. Your cancer will 100% kill you without any treatment, and with treatment, many forms of cancer have a very real chance of being completely eliminated. As I said, all it takes is 1 cell for cancer to come back. Do not act like it is the doctor's fault or that they are hiding a cure or profiting off of this research. Cancer clinical trials are extremely expensive and long, and the doctors are totally dedicated to their work. They are not collecting money and kicking back. I absolutely hate this song, this man is the TRUE person trying to profit off of cancer by giving false messages and acting like he understands the struggle. He took a touchy issue and wrote a song to profit off of the emotionally vulnerable. Please for the love of God, if any of you out there are cancer patients or have someone close to you who is a cancer patient do not spread the ignorant message of this song that promotes an anti-medicine ideology.
At first i thought tom was just another trend that would come and go. But this man showed me that you cant just give up on something you dont know. Give it time and it may be something you grow to truly love.
My sister died of cervical cancer in 2014 our mom will probably not make it this year liver
I have stage 4 lung cancer for 3 yrs. Thanks Tom
The sad Part is that you can heal Cancer but the Elites makes a Fortune with the Medical Threatment. Research yourself and get healed!  God Bless You
4/30/19 is when I beaten cancer 20 years old
To think I once judged this dude on his looks... I see how very wrong I was. Tom u keep it up man ur leading the change we need!
Tom, not sure if you realize this but you have the true spirit of Punk Rock...You say what's right and do what you do without fear...It is why you will rise on your humility not your pride. I think you and Rollins should have a long talk.
my dad die after he found out he had stage 4 lung cancer and I'm not afraid to say that this song made me cry.
Not the first time I'm listening to this, and I've spent more time erasing and retyping than actual commenting. Words don't always come easy, so I'm gonna skip details and just say thank you.
look up world without cancer by g edward griffin
I actually deleted this comment once because i didn't want to seem like i was trying to get attention but heres my story of a woman who was like a grandma to me  I was sitting at home playing a game of forhonor and what seemed to be a normal day of me having no life turned upside down when my mom called me saying "Honey" and i knew something was wrong cause she usually says How ya doin honey so i responded with "Is everything okay momma" she said "Penny is back in the hospital" i didn't know what to say all i could think of is "Oh" its just one of those things that you know will happen but never expect it and that just makes it hurt more so my mom came and picked me up so we could go to the hospital with everyone and everyone that knew her was there she made an impact on everyones life, I got to go in when she was sleeping and i made sure to tell her i love her every chance I got but it never really kept me from wanting to cry and then i remember going in the next day and she was actually awake so i told her i love her and that she is beautiful and she said "I lovve you to buddy" you could tell in her voice she was tired of fighting and it just hurt but coming in the next day is a pain ill never forget she asked the to let us all see her then take her off  life support i remember hearing that then balling my eyes out i remember telling her "Hey Penny i love you i hope you know how beautiful you are and that you mean so much to me" and i remember her saying "Hey buddy i love you to you will always be my buddy stay strong okay" and i nodded and i remember playing the ps4 later that night trying to escape the thoughts of the women i knew since i was born (i was 18 at the time) leaving me and then my mom called and i already knew what she was gonna say and of course i had to answered and she said "Hey honey" i said "Hi mom" and she said "Shes gone" so i hung up and started crying the woman i thought of as invincible gone the one who cared for everyone else even as she was dying gone the one who could make anyone happy gone and i knew that she said to stay strong but how can you be strong when one of your pillars of strength just crumbles but id never wanna disappoint her so i lifted it up myself no matter how much i wanna give up sometimes and just stop trying i know i cant i have to stay strong for her because i promised her i would
Wow how have I missed this one. Your music hits home very hard I mean every track I can find something to relate to. I am glad I found your music. it helps me every day keep doing you.
Love the way he did this. Respect bro!
We need to change how we live ,go back to older ways . Cure is out there growing all around you
Tears to my eyes....your music is so soul touching
You quickly became one of my favorite artists once I started listening to more of your music. Anyone who hears this and doesnt feel something isnt listening.
"we dont know were we'll go when we die" Thanks for the chills and ill see you tomorrow
Thanks for your music we all can use your message I. Each song you are truly the best rapper ever
You know what they say "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger".
Lost my sister to brain cancer. This hits hard.
I just got diagnosed with atypical carcinoid cancer, it's a rare cancer that usually affects the intestines but it is in my lungs. And they said having it by age 25 is almost unheard of. Lifes been weird, scary and often seems unreal since my diagnosis. I've always jammed your music through the house but this has been my go to lately truly an amazing song.
Love your music
Maybe it is different but the only one I have lost to cancer was my dog. We drove around all day to visit all kinds of vets and clinics, even abroad and the last one in the evening said that she wouldn't want to let us leave with the dog since the cancer had spread so much and was pretty much inoperable. From everything is good and a lively dog to cant hold in his urine and almost suffocating withing two weeks because the main tumour was so big, it squeezed the air out of his lungs and was oozing water in between the organs. I don't think we will ever beat cancer since it is so random. But at least we can try.
Regardless of whatever, I love you for this man.
Just been diagnosed with cancer...and as you said... " i wont give up, i know i am strong." Gonna listen to this song everytime i go for treatment Thank you for this song❣it honestly touched me
Man I've lost so many to this illness. Thank you tom
Cancer sucks 😢
❤️❤️❤️
yes there is a cure and they are hiding it.  Hoping President Trump can expose this and make it be available along with cures for AIDS and MS and SO Many other things.  If POTUS can't - please God make someone else be strong enuf to expose all the SECRETS.  ><>
Survior!!!!!!
that guy is soooo underrated!!!!....
Who else is making songs like this?? ... While WAP (disgusting) gets all the acclaim this guy is changing lives!! ... Keep doing what you do man!!
Thanks happy new year
My dads been struggling to stay alive since his surgery on sept.1 hes flatlined so many times, life support most of the time.  This song kills me but I cant stop listening to it. Tom always has great songs.
Not trying to pry Mr.macdonald but I can feel your emotions in this Did you write this for a personal experience
Hey Tom. I have come across a band called citizen soldier. They have a song called would anyone care. I think it would be a great song for you to do a collaboration with this song "cancer". Everyones doing collabs and these two send the same message and line up really well. I would love to see you two work together. I think it would be amazing. You'll find both songs on my public playlist collaborations if you're interested
Thumbs up to u great song brother
thank you tomim a cancer survivor it means alot to know you think of us in your music, #hog4life
Unreal lil brother
Mom is currently going through treatments and has been fighting cancer for almost 10 years god just keeps sending miracle after miracle. And this is honestly amazing I just wish Tom believed in God. He would be happy and not so sad all the time if he had god. That’s all you are missing Tom please I pray you find him.
Drugs and therapies make money, we are nothing more than a grain of sand to government.
I don't like most of the political takes you have.  But thank you for this song.
Lost my momma 4 months ago to cancer.... its been the hardest thing I've ever faced.....witnessing every part of it was traumatizing and has now become what haunts me..
Tom, you are awesome. I lost my grandmother to cancer... I miss her.

Who ever dislikes have no heart
I don’t usually comment on things Tom and I doubt you’ll see this but I hope you know how much good you do for people please don’t stop what you’re doing
It's weird yet refreshing to see Tom do a wholesome song.
I just lost my grandpa to cancer last month he battled it for three years. My other grandpa I lost to brain cancer but 27 years ago. This song hits close to home. But thank you for making it Tom.
I love this song but not only does this song open peoples eyes to cancer. It should also open peoples eyes not to judge someone on their piercings or where they choose to put their tattoos. Love ya brother.
did anyone realize that the doctor was the teacher from white boy and the dad was the officer from straight white male! cewl!
Excellent video
i have cancer and i am 9
I read somewhere the Nano Technology is being used to cure cancer in fact a women cured cancer in rats in 15day due to this but it wasn't on any news or radio it isnt even widly known and thats a sad fact we face
I just love your words in each and every song you shoot 😊❤️they are so powerful 💪others are funny 😂 but teaching 😊. Hey you are the best ever rapper 💯big up man ✊
Thanks, Tom.
Please do a song with Hopsin!
Beautiful song, great, powerful meaning
Brought me to tears. Grammy KANALA!!!
Cancer is a fungus
my dad has cancer and fighting everyday... he wont get chemo as he says he will rather enjoy his live than suffer thru chemo and maybe it doesnt work anyway been almost 10years now and his still going strong
Your music hits me so fucking hard I hope you never stop brother you are a god send
Wow this is Beautiful ❤️
My father died when i was 17 from cancer because of this sick pharma industry, he was healthy until he underwent chemo and i can´t understand how 3200 people are disliking this. I hope nobody gets a cancer even if you dislike this, because nobody can imagine what it´s like , until you experience it, even if you are triggered, the truth is unbeatable.
My grandmother battled breast cancer for 6 whole years. I miss you every day <3
♥️♥️♥️♥️🖤🖤🖤🖤🤛🏻
The 3.2 disklikes are pharma executives
I lost my grandpa due to lung cancer from smoking cigarettes. He was my best friend and 6 years later I still miss him. I remember seeing him in a coma and telling him I’ll be fine and two hours later he took his last breath. It was the worst experience seeing him miserable...I just thank he held on for me to say goodbye. I will always you...my best friend...my guardian angel.
I watched my grandmother fight cancer and chemo was worse. She had to take treatments farther apart than most because it would hit her so much harder. She would sleep for days after a visit to the hospital but through all of it she kept taking care of my grandfather while he was slowly dieing from diabetes. She still got up to clean and make meals and shower him. Sometimes it would be harder for her so I moved in to help take him to appointments and help take her to her treatments. It was hard on everyone mostly because the chemo was getting to her head. She started getting hostile towards everyone being a proud person she hated getting help from others. My grandmother was the kindest person I knew but the chemo changed her in her last 2 years the most and I just wish she didn't have to go out like that. Pushing everyone away at the end. Its been a few years since then and I thought I was ok about it all but this song hit me hard. For all you out there fighting cancer stay strong. And those who are around them fighting you need to stay strong for them. Got to lean on each other.  I miss you Grammy.
15,000+ comments and I must've read at least 1,000 of them and man this breaks my heart and my thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you that's going through the tough times now. Just like I have gone through the comments, I really hope that Tom did the same too. Also, you don't see these mumble rappers or the corny rappers making songs like this, much love and respect to Tom for this.
I just lost my mom to breast cancer this year on Halloween. This song made me cry for sure. I love you mom. You were strong like Tom said. ❤️. Start safe everyone.
This song tears my heart in two.
Stop making people think that cancer is a "battle".  You can survive it, but you can't fight it.  Nothing you can do will change anything.  You can't choose to beat this, you can only keep going. Some will make it and some won't and neither have anything to do with someone deciding to "fight" or not.  It sucks, it's sad, but the idea of "fighting" it comes from the drug companies who want you to try every possible option because they get paid when you do.
this actually made me tear up.
Tom, thank you for this. Surviving stage 4 ovarian. I shared this song with my support group. ♡ we needed this. The lyrics and the video both nailed it. 🤘
My grandma had had cancer multiple times several different types of cancer. She came close to dying but she’s alive, my aunt also had cancer but it alive, God is good
Everybody knows someone who's sick Forty percent will get cancer, only half's gonna live Your mom and your dad and your sister stand inside a room And someone won't survive it, do you hope it isn't you? I swear that cancer has a cure, but they're refusing to make it They've done like forty years of research, ninety billion in donations We've been running for the cure and wearing ribbons for ages Why are people still going through radiation? It's fucking crazy Hundred billion-dollar industry, they can't afford to end it And nobody wants to die, our only option is to spend it We give anything to stick around for just another second Give a fortune to the doctors who promise they can extend it The profits are astronomic, the hospital and the clinics Of fillings coffins with dollars, it's awful, let's just admit it We're all human, we'll keep fighting 'cause it's how we survive But it's scary 'cause we don't know where we'll go when we die Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart Nothing matters if you don't have your health All the money in the world doesn't help The good might go to Heaven and the bad might go to Hell But no one wants to leave here, you can tell And cancer touches everyone, it's in our genetics And our world's become so toxic, it's all carcinogenic We've polluted the water, the air; the food we're ingesting Is full of hormones and poison, our population's infected They sell us cigarettes and liquor, built a business on addictions We've been paying them to kill ourselves, we're dying to keep living It's the system, it's a prison, we keep trying to beat it We get cancer from keeping all of our demons a secret And our insurance don't cover the things we need to defeat it And even if it does, then we might die from the treatment Our best defence is living like we do not know what cancer is Fight it if you have it and pray that there's something after this Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart You won't know how to be brave Till you choose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength Till you struggle to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith Till you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take Till you realize you didn't break Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart
I found out I had Thyroid Cancer in September. (Follicular cancer) had my thyroid removed. Then a week ago found out I have Intestinal Metaplasia and could develop stomach cancers any time. I don’t even know where to turn ......
This should mave millions if not more views, just my opinion....💪🇺🇸
I lost my Mom to lung cancer a little over a year ago. It was tough. It still is. Thanks Tom.
Lost my dad to cancer Dec 18, 2020.  Thank you.
Tom my mother in law just passed away on Monday from lung cancer. She was a beautiful soul. This song hits and you are one of the truest raw emotional and honest artist I’ve ever heard. There is healing in music. 🔥🙌
Ive been fighting this disease  for over a  year and  might be in other parts of my body . PV a rare blood cancer  and  Nogales on my lungs
Bladder cancer survivor here. ♥️🙏♥️
Tom I pray this helps a lot of people. Your songs touch my heart everyone of them because they are so real. Don't stop people need your songs that's why you always hit #1.
Still here guys wondering why the doctor can find a cure for cancer only 98% of us have cancer ... but all of use still fighting  to surive2020-2021
This song hits different when you have lost a loved one to cancer
His not losing
1 of 5.  Tom, I'm a 60-year-old white woman who is a Christian & was misdiagnosed with a 'non-cancerous' lump almost 10 years ago, same lump biopsied cancer 5 years ago.  I ran across your name listening to Brandon Tatum on a whim, & I have just been amazed!  Hands down I'm not your usual fan type...lol.  But you are right about so much! and judging books by their cover is foolish:   You made my day.  God's not done with this old dark world when there are still young people like you seeking the truth.  You just keep speaking the truth & keep seeking it & you'll find He who is the truth & freedom indeed. People who love lies and partial truths are always going to give you guff...they hung Jesus who was too much truth & light for them on a cross, after all!  Jews and Gentiles both involved in that little deal...which would be every race accounted for.  There is so much wrong in the churches that it's a maze these days, and folks you never thought would are falling away & into the mystical, magical antichrist we're-all-gods unity so fast that it takes your breath away:  but God & his word is straight & true, and foretold it all....so, you keep looking & you'll know for yourself which one that is! (Hint: it'$ the one that they can't copyright that fulfills Psalm 12...lol: I know you'll get that!)   - After my cancer diagnosis even my status quo husband was shocked by the evasive answers to the straight-forward questions I asked my oncologist, and the 'this is the way it goes', cookie cutter, no choice 'standard of care'.  Chemo.  If you survive that: radiation.  THEN surgery....even though that's not the best protocol for my cancer type even in typical standard care.  When I told him I wasn't afraid to die, he started telling me about how he was 'a man of faith, too' and waxing poetical & philosophical about what we know & don't know, light being waves or beams.... blah, blah, blah....but he was certain sure that any alternative treatment was proven wrong, and though he couldn't deviate from 'the plan' of the oncology center, that was my best option.   I wondered how he could falter at straight-forward questions & be so mystically wishy-washy & circuitous in his reasoning...but be so certain about that!   - The answer was too obvious.  Golden handcuffs and 1 Timothy 6:10 KJB.  It made him uncomfortable...but not THAT uncomfortable, so he found self-justification for himself short of truth.  2 Thessalonians 2 KJB.    Illegalizing honesty!  GREAT line!  You'll love the straight-shooting prophets & Jude.  The Jesus they never talk about who preached Matthew 23, Mark 9 & 12-13 and Luke  20 & 21 KJB.    - When we walked out, my husband looked stunned, & told me the decision on treatment going forward was mine & he understood my lack of trust, which was huge.  The second appointment fixed any hesitation I had to go it on my own because they lied to me, telling me that this next appointment would be to answer financial questions....we knew of a fellow living under the bridge after losing his wife to cancer, & his home because of the bills, and I wanted to avoid that or plan,  but it wasn't about that at all.  They just told me that to get me to come back & started telling me how the chemo would kill certain body functions, how sick I could expect to be, and what drugs I would have to take for the rest of my life to perform the functions my dead body systems wouldn't be capable of anymore!!  Thinking fear would keep me captive & that since I wasn't a 'medical professional' I wouldn't understand what they meant.   -
My mum has had cancer for 3 years now I'm so scared it will come back and she will be taken from me too soon :( hate cancer! There must be a cure they just want people to die so it's not over populated
As a cancer survivor / warrior I applaud your work, all of it and this really hit home.  I am a filmmaker / musician / activist and I am SOOO GRATEFUL to have discovered you Tom!
🙏
Damn I had Goosebumps listening to this. You 🔥 Bro.
9am on Christmas ✔️ out Tom MacDonald's new music video!!!
Thanks tom
Lost my great aunt sandra in 2019 to lung cancer that came back now 2020 just lost my uncle scotty to all who has lost anyone merry christmas and much love to u and urs fight on much love to all
My Grandpa died last year due to Stage 3 cancer and i watched him every week getting weaker and weaker until he couldn't do much of anything.  It was the worse thing to watch someone go through with the amount of pain he was in.  After he died, i vouched myself to help people who need it the most and donate some of my money to Cancer treatments to help fight this damn disease. Watching this video and hearing the lyrics brought me back to when my Grandpa was dying on his bed.
Imagine making a song about how bad cancer is and how brave the people are who go through it and 3k people dislike it, like bruh fucks wrong with people 🤣
Hats off Tom!!!....⚜📖⚜📜🛡💯💌🙏🎼😎🎼🕊🍃🌷🍃🌷🍃🌷🍃🕊👣✝️🙄🌬♥️
To any and all that are fighting cancer. Don't give up, keep Fighting. My nephew had cancer at the age of 15. 30% chance to beat it they gave him. After coming out of a comma , he had to relearn all motor skills. Walk, talk, eat, speak. All motor skills. Glory be to God, he pulled threw and is still with us today. He kept fighting and beat it. Reach for that higher power. Keep Fighting. Dude is the strongest young man I know. He never gave up, threw all the odds. Love you CJ and am glad we still have you here buddy.
Lilith is my god so hell but she loves me so I won't suffer
why would u dislike this... yall are so cruel
Repeat customers are a lot more profitable than a customer who only visits once
Feeding us cancer and treating us with more cancer
Cancer is so easy to fight and they are taking that ability from us
If cancer going to kill me just drop a bomb on my house. I dont want to go out like that to be honest
Yeah!
Try CBD oil 🛢
F’in love you buddy 🤙. You’re good people. I’ve been to St Judes and had the opportunity to see the amazing kids there back when I was in college about 10 years ago. It absolutely humbles you. And now being a dad myself and putting things in perspective I appreciate my kids even more.
We can know where we will go when we die. Except Jesus
Fuck this song gives me chills every time I hear it.
My best friend died of cancer.  Damn leukemia.  I needed this. Thank you bro
Chemo is death. There are cures.
this song is beautiful
Tom Macdonald that hit deep bro
Wow !  What a song.  Thanks Tom.
WOW... This truly sucks
Had a tumor under my bone next to my eye removed bone and lost feeling in part of my face. I was 14 when I found out had radiation treatments burned my face and throat didn't eat for 6 weeks had to get I.V's to keep from wasting away. Lost a lot of people who I became friends with at the kids hotel they put us in called the Ronald McDonald house very hard experience.
This will be considered extreme by most people, but when you have little left to lose, why not research and try it. I have Multiple Sclerosis and I did a 7 day dry fast; that's no food OR water. Yes you can do it...I did. And no, you don't die. But you need to research how to do it safely and how to introduce food back slowly, post fast. A retired NASA engineer/chemist/physicist by the name of August Dunning wrote about it in his book, The Phoenix Protocol. He has YouTube videos (Phoenix Protocol) that explain the science behind it; how you activate your own Stem cells. Neurological tissue is not supposed to be repairable but my permanent MS symptoms FADED into near obscurity. Dry fasting has helped those with radiation damage and those with cancer- a few Russian scientists found this out when studying Chernobyl radiation victims. Again, what do you have to lose?
R.i.p Sandra ann Ridley she always wrote our bus she would be 24 now I was just a little kid she died at my age 17 in 2013 she had the Kindest Heart and the most positive attitude my memory is very faded because I am now 17 I'm pretty sure I was around 10 years old she would always bring snacks on the bus and would always talk to you she lost her life up to cancer cancer is a serious killer I'm thankful that Tom McDonald actually made a song about this piece of shit thing called cancer
From one cancer patient to another, I tell you this: *You never know how strong you are until being strong is your only choice* . You're stronger than you may think. There may have been days where you have cried, there may have been days where you've been asking yourself "How did I end up like this?" or "Why me?!", there may have been days where you're suffering so much you just want everything to end, but that's exactly what the cancer wants you to do, to give up, to stop fighting, to think that there's no hope. And in the inevitable case that there's no return and death is the only thing that awaits me, I'd rather die fighting than dying after giving up and putting my head down.  Medications are not the only treatment. Your friends, your family and any other people that show appreciation to you play a big role, hold onto them tightly, they could be even more effective than the treatment itself. Cry if you need to cry, yell if you need to yell, just don't let those negative emotions stack up, it will only worsen things.  To all of you, may God bless you.
<-- Stage 3 Hodgkin's Lymphoma Warrior
🐐 🐐 🔥 🔥 best rapper rn on my life keep it up man do your thang !
bro this made me cry... I lost by grandfather to cancer a few years back.. 3 months after he was diagnosed he passed awawy😥
Your comments section asked me what I thought of the song, I was going to give it all stars but after the first one it said thank you and dissapeared! Plz know that this song brought tears and I felt it in my heart, Tom dont let your gift fade, the people need your gift. Luv ya, Jo-Jo aka Nanya Biznizz1
who the ffff gives this a thumbs down? The 3100 hang your head in shame
Made me cry so fucking hard Tom you bully
This song hits different for me now. I listened to this when it first dropped. It touched me then, but now I'll use it as inspiration. This week I was told I have a cancer vastly spreading through my body. I really needed to re hear this song. 🤘 #HOG
9 months they developed a vaccine thats 95%effective.   they cant do shit against cancer.  I'm calling bullshit
This hit me hard my mom was just found out shes has cancer just before Christmas
This really touched me because my grandmother battled eye cancer for 4 years everyday then it was gone then 2 years later she got liver cancer and it was to late
My aunt is going to die from cancer in less than a year. I’m so sad
Phenomenal song.  This guy is a lot more than he seems like...
New rapper discovered his shit is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My grandmother was diagnosed with brest cancer at the beginning of lockdowns. Shes winning but its been so tough. Thank you
💯💥💋🌹
My mum in the picture died from cancer on September 3 2016...my name is Emma.....I miss my mummy very much
Holy shit this is so powerful
I seen this song on here since it got released and kept putting it off because I watched my mom die of lung cancer. It was literally the worst thing I could deal with in my late teens. You hit it on the head every time though.
I listen to this soooo much. Tom your at the chemo clinic every 4 weeks and every Thursday night when I have to take a pill form of chemo. I don’t have cancer but 3 diseases that respond to chemo. If your views blow up on this song... it’s me and me sharing it at the clinic. Some days are tough and the nights are really longer. Bless you for this!! I’m a nurse, now on disability and lost my purpose. Nursing was my passion!!! Sorry it’s so long. It’s just from my ❤️ on a long night.
Why did she shave her head??? Is it a condition with cancer or something? I thought it was the cancer that made you lose hair tho not that the person actually shaves their head themselves.
Lost my dad just over a year ago now, this hit hard man. Love you Tom.
My best friend told me today she has stage 4 cancer, I felt this in my soul. ❤
people who dislike don't have heart
I lost my right leg to cancer. I’m one of the lucky ones. your song definitely hit home for me🙏🙏🙏
Lost both parents in 2018 to cancer 2 months apart. Was hardest year of my life. I miss you Mom and Dad more than words can express.
Keep being YOU!
They had the money to look for a cure for cancer but they didn’t then sooon as covid comes then they put all the money in for a vaccine like what the hell
I just found this guy and he just spits straight facts. Fucking love it keep it going
Thank you so much for this song Tom. I honestly can't Express how much I love this song and is now my fight song and listen to it any time i dont think i can keep fight. This song/video was released right after I finished radiation and my break before starting chemo. I was diagnosed  with a crab apple size stage 2 anaplastic astrocytoma may 15, 2020. Starting my third cycle out of 8 cycles of chemo on dec 30th. Thank you so much for helping me keep fight.
This shit almost made me cry 😳😢😢
❤Your heart is Gold bro.💛  Everyone who is going through it. Stay Strong. Show em all.
I dont remember the last time a video made me so emotional.  I just lost my godmother/cousin to cancer/covid last week. This song is amazing and the man who sings it!
April 30/2019, I been in remission from stage 1 colon cancer and I know everyone is a fighter of some sort of illness, I’m still fighting stuff
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
We didn’t do this to ourselves.  The fallen angels have been wanting us destroyed ...
FANTASTIC song..... from a Head & Neck Cancer Survivor 2020

My mom passed two years ago from cancer and I struggle everyday thinking of ending my life missing her and your song broke me thank you for your music 💕
You wont know how to be brave, till you choose to fight when you’re afraid. You won’t experience strength, till you struggle to carry the weight. And you won’t know why you have faith, till you look the devil in the face.  Love it, so true.
My mom died of cancer, I have cancer.
cancer is the true pandemic . keep up your amazing work tom macdonald your  music is inspiring and much needed
Salute to you Tom and Nova, i am almost 60 and you are one of my all time favorite artists, i keep asking myself how is someone so young so very wise, i thank god he blesses us with you both.

I lost two family members to cancer
My brother fought off cancer when he was just a young kid. Just to have degenerative heart disease and pass away at only 36.
Time to wake up.... we got serious problems if we don't play this on radio because it gives people strength and positivity.
Badass is all I can say.   Just badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Most high god,. Lord of hosts,. My creator,. However whoever wherever whatever is out there I pray every single person that has been sick or suffering of any cancer illness injury or disease is healed,. I pray they are in good health,. They are grace they are love they are peace,. I pray they are prosperous they are happy and joyous,. I pray they hold you close to them and that they live your will for them because I am so grateful for you and how good you are,. I pray in Jesus name,. Amen

God Bless You, Tom! I had a cousin who I was close to pass from pancreatic cancer two years ago. This made me cry.
40 years on research 100B spend and no cure, but covid-19 just hit a year and we got  a vaccine.  Brother your lyrics are so powerful God bless you.
Put your faith in Jesus Christ, the one whom came for you and me, as a sacrifice for our sins and you will know where you are going when you die.   I know....why do I need a sacrifice? I'm a good person. Good by who's definition? Ever lied? Stolen? Cheated? God is perfect and he created us to walk with him but we chose to disobey and let Satan in. The devil is real! Hell is real. And so is Heaven. Find Christ, ask Him to come into your life, repent and seek him. It will be the greatest decision of your entire life. Because He is the way, the Truth and the life....we are all seeking deep inside.   Tom your talents are from God, the one who created you and gave you life and purpose. Use this for His glory and speak His truth.
I just try to capture a point... I persue nothing... everything.. god damn..

I have known Madam for like 5 years now. He is such an awesome fighter with his brain cancer. I love him to death. No pun intended.  😍😋😎😂😂🤗🤗 I love your rapping, inks and you. Keep safe and healthy. 😍😍🤗🤗

No words 💕😭
Thank you bro.....just thank you. Cancer runs in my family, watched mom and dad both go through it....thank you for this ❤❤
I just watched this video. I watched while every form of cancer take every one of my family members and I am alone in this world now. I wish my dad heard this song before he passed. Thank you, Tom.
I hurt so bad . Dr has me on pain Meds. Pain just getting worse in my rib cage. Nights are long. Can't wait till this pain is gone.
I saw my godfather's progress deteriate within 6 months of his diagnosis. He has learned me one phrase that he lived: " Once you quit, you' ve already lost". I will always remember this. What a massive emotional song Tom, Thank you for igniting my flame again
Turkey tail mushrooms is a approved treatment for cancer in Japan. I just ordered my mom some i hope it helps
I took this to heart he is so inspiring ❤ 💓 I want to meet him and tell him how much he has done for me just makeing these songs he is the best rapper I swear ❤ 💖  he helps me through depression and he thinks like me
3 years ago a young, bright, and beautiful woman died from a rare cancer in her spine and nose. I went to high school with her and she was such a joy and the brightest star I knew going through school. She loved everyone and was always smiling and friends with everyone. 4 years ago her bones started to just break, simply from banging into a table. after her back broke in 3 places just from going down some stairs they did all the tests and found her cancer.....but it was already in stage 3. they removed what they could and did treatments and she slowly did ok. wheelchair bound, bald and beautiful still. she would send everyone messages on Facebook, video messages mostly letting us know how she was doing but she never would show us how she looked. Then 6 months after fighting she sent her final video to us, she looked so thin and fragile but still, she smiled for us and told us that her numbers were going up and that she may not need the body brace that allowed her to sit up in her wheelchair. ...2 weeks later everyone got the news that she had passed in her sleep, she was 24 years old. She was one of those people you look at and think she will be a great mother, and they had been trying even. Why such a pure soul, I don't know. But I am grateful she isn't in any more pain. thank you Tom for this video, i may be crying but it means a lot and defiantly hit home.
I took my son to two different hospitals and lived in them with him... he was a year and a half old & passed just before his 4th birthday.. RIP Ashtyn! You were a fighter man, I love you so much! I hope one day I’ll be as brave as you
MMS WILL HELP
*** GREAT BILL*** GREAT BILL*****GREAT BILL  **THE AMERICAN ANTI CORRUPTION ACT**  —GRASS ROOTS BILL THAT NEEDS MORE ATTENTION—
FUCKIN AWESOME 👏
The fact he isn't on Mainstream tv is a blessing but also fucked up. All his songs got hella substance and should be given more attention.  But the main stream wants to promote WAP..... Salute to all y'all who recognize real.
i recently lost my wife in February, she had lymphoma, she was 37, i became a widower at the age of 31, cancer sucks, tom speaks the truth, im glad i found his music, his music is real.
My friends son is suffering from aml leukemia. Hes only 7. Was diagnosed when he was 6, just months before his 7th birthday. No health insurance. Please pray he makes it threw. 7th round of chemo.  3rd or 4th time of relapse of remission.  #liljacobmergard #cancersucks
Lost my granny to spinal cancer almost 2 decades ago and this song still hit me right in the gut. I never got to say goodbye coz I was too cowardly to watch the toughest person I have ever known get beaten so horribly by this demon of a disease.  Thanks for this mate, brilliant tribute to those fighting and those we've all lost! <3
My mother in law unfortunately lost her battle to Stage 4 Throat & Kidney Cancer on the 24/09/20, two days before her birthday... Although this song kicked me hard in the feels, in a lot of ways it is beautiful and I hope gives current sufferers of cancer + survivors the strength & encouragement to stay strong. Thank you for this song ❤️
My dad passed Pancreatic spread all over 20plus military years served. . Thank you Dad. I live you.. You baby girl...Killed me. F-U. Pharma.!!!!! God bless all you survivors and those lost. 🙏
Okay this is the only song that I agree with...I genuinely DONT NOT LIKE HIMM AT ALL but this song is good
The way you speak the truth is amazing i love the fact that you dont care what others think. I just found your music a few days ago and i gotta say keep up the good work and putting heart into the words you say
Been putting off listening to this song, cause a friend lost her lil girl to cancer at age 3...  This hits home. Tears in my eyes.. Tom can I just say you are amazing. The song you do are truly awesome. X
The funny thing about the accusations of Nova helping write the music is that people think it takes away from the music or performance. But regardless we love the end result to include the music video. Thank you Tom and Nova for being real
I'm usually one to only like an artist's top hits, but with you, I love all of your music. Thank you for being you. I can only imagine that is what keeps you relevant time and time again.
This song has helped me. I know he sings this for people like me I got brain cancer I'm fight day by day
OMG Tom thx for this song.... my wife almost died on cancer she refuse chemo and choose for  run from the cure pure thc oil .... i put it on my fb to say to every idiot who nows talk about the big vaccin against that covid bullshit that they need to shut up your damn right with this lyric I swear that cancer has a cure, but they're refusing to make it They've done like forty years of research, ninety billion in donations We've been running for the cure and wearing ribbons for ages Why are people still going through radiation? It's fucking crazy ...you rock dude  with your lyrics !!!!! gracias a Metal fan
♥️
I just discovered you tonight through Gothix when she did a reaction to No Lives Matter. Great F’n song. So is this one. I really love your music! ❤️
I love it Tom! Great work! I was sort of expecting to see you shaving your head as you rap. Come on Tom! Shave those fabulous golden locks and donate it to the people that make wigs for cancer patients. I'll do it if you do! I bet alot of us would follow you!
My uncle rich died to cancer... and they supposedly did everything they could for him he was barely 49 when he passed. I hate the government in times like that
I’m a grown man crying listening to this.
I accidentally came up with his creations, damn he's spitting fire.
Lost my grandfather and uncle to lung cancer grampa was exposed to agent orange during Vietnam and uncle was a smoker my grampas death hit me hard until my friends 14 year old passed 3 months ago from cancer. Juat listening to these songs made me think about them. Great song and fuck cancer
Lost my mother and grandmother to cancer, both sisters had ovarian cancer lots of cancer in my family so this song really hits home brings tears to my eyes every time i hear it. KEEP MAKING GREAT MUSIC BRO HAVE NOT HEARD A SONG I DIDN'T LIKE KEEP IT UP.
Bruh
My mom has cancer this helps
Having a mother with terminal cancer, I would like to thank u for the song. Its perfect men <3
We get cancer from keeping all our demons a secret. I wasn’t crying until that line. Ugh. I feel like I was just stabbed in the heart.
This hits hard 🥲one of the hardest things I have ever been through . Stay strong have hope , keep faith . Fuck cancer !!
Just found this guy last night and wow. It’s really all you can say because this is the most intelligent way anyone has utilized rap since immortal technique.
Man....this'll hit you in the feels,hard
This guys a legend!!!!
❤
Just heard this with my wife. My wife cried this song is fire! We love your work keep producing! If you need a drummer to do a rock/rap song/album hit me up!
I shouldn't be crying at 4am.
Sometimes there's just no fight left...
Don't listen to Tom he is the farthest thing from independent rapper more than anyone else in the industry.
Tom I have a friend who is a bio-engineer who also lost his mother to cancer. Chemo is great for children b/c their bodies are continually growing stronger and can fight off a lot more at that age than any other age. The problem being is that it has turned into a blanket cure which is wrong. In reality there has been proof of Cannabis curing/preventing a lot of cancer if drank(tea), ate, or even if smoked. So Chemo was good when it was discovered but the fact we are still using it sucks.
hell...this brought tears running, i get how it feels losing a family member to this..damn..i replayed this like 10 actual times, each time brought more tears up. Tom is a powerful artist, y'all gotta respect this man for never switching, despite the odds, the man is admirable
Great music.  What an amazing young man.  You are a fighter.  And we thank you.  Keep bringing the truth kid...
I fucking love this song but everytime I hit play I cant help but ball like a baby simply because its obvious what big pharma does to people that truly need help to live and when it comes to how much money they have already itll never be enough to cure certain illnesses By choice
I just wanna know y people dislike this video do you have a ducking heart are you drop on your head when you was young
Thank you for this much respect🙏🙏Tom may God Bless you have such a good ❤ hope the best for you and Nova .such a great song this world right now needs more of this

MY Mum died 11 years ago of Lymphoma. Her Doctor told her it was Rheumatoid Arthritis. I kept telling her and her husband to get a second opinion but they wouldn't. Fluid seeped from her skin, she slept in a lazy boy for a year because lying down was uncomfortable. They wouldn't listen to me. She finally ended up in Hospital, I was there when the Doctors told her she had Lymphoma and did she want Chemo ..... She died two hours later! I still feel extremely angry. I came across your music a month ago by accident, Tom. I'm 60, don't like much rap, as you can imagine, but I'm a big fan, your music has a message.
The cure is in alkalinity, cancer  cells cannot survive a proper PH , most people are acid not alkaline. Read Alkalize or Die .
Wow I need this,  I sick, it's not cancer but  part of what will kill me was put there by a Doctor.  To save me, (all true) now I wait for it to kill me.  No one cares,  they know it would happen but no one stop it.  Iam not the only one.  Thank You
I made amends with my mom recently. It was beautiful. Forgiveness and love on both sides. Then I find out she's been fighting this shit for 7-8 years. Had her left breast removed, flatlined for 4 minutes from a heart attack. Now she has 2 stints. Then they had put steel rods in her spine to keep her from getting paralyzed. She lost her teeth and her hair. And now they say it moved into her bones and that they can't cure it, just help minimize the pain. In spite of all that, she hasn't given up. She's still fighting every way she can. She hasn't become angry, bitter, resentful it hateful even though she has every right to be. She's inspiring me to be better. I love my mom.  Thank you, Tom. It ain't a cure, but it does help. Big love to you, brother. Keep being amazing.
Oh man!
Trust me Tom mcdonald gets all the respect he deserves. The thing is he gets it from alot of people who cant pick up a phone or go on a computer to tell you how much he means to people. So if hes getting this much respect now lol just think of all those people hes influenced that doesnt have the strength now to say thank you.  Tom mcdonalds influence on people has no boundaries. Its beautiful art and it will carry on to our future....... Hopefully
Diagnosed in 2012, went through 8 years of it.  5 separate drugs/combinations.  Given 20% chance to live.  Survived my Stem cell Transplant back in June.  If you're going through it just know you can do it!!  Just believe in what you're doing.  Stay strong.  The old me died in 2012, and this year I was reborn cancer free, But it took 8 years of Limbo and fear to get me here.  Fight!!! And Survive.  I love life and you should to💚💜
Cancer
Bro love this song my mom's 10th battle with cancer this time she beating even with the Parkinson's love most ur song keep them coming mahalo
Woah woah woah, 2 heavy bro
40% of the population gets cancer because of vaccines and genetically modified food. But mainly vaccines. Enjoy those flu shots.
How can anyone be so HEARTLESS to thumbs down this video????
My uncle recently just lost his battle with cancer
😭😭😭😭😭😭 hit the spot but beautiful light to shine on the darkest little daily killer we all lose someone or ourselves over great video Gosdbless you all and your families
Words in this song are so true! This world is all about money!  You can’t tell me they don’t have a cure!
I see the cancer society has thumbs down this song.
40% get cancer because that's the way the government wanted it to be. The vast majority of cancer has been spread and caused by our government using us as guinea pigs in their science experiments
Lost my mom to cancer last year this song hits hard. Keep doing what your doing bro ur shit is real we need more artists like you
🤫 a lion is singin.
My cousin who is 3 got cancer (pleuropulmonary blastoma) it is a rare childhood cancer and only 500 people worldwide have been diagnosed. She is a fighter, survivor, she is loving and caring. Let me tell you her story. It started in summer of 2020 and she had fevers, coughs, throwing up and more. Finally after a little bit her parents got really worried. They went to the doctors. The doctors ran tests, scanning x-rays and CT scans. With all of that they found tumors in the lung. Multiple tumors. She was stage 3 of her cancer. She is still ongoing chemo therapy. But her tumor has shrunken. She is completely bald, has a nose feeding tube. But yet through all of that she is still smiling. It is amazing what she can do. She got to go home because she was doing so much better. She is very tired. This song reminded me of her. We are sending prayers and love to her and I hope you will do the same. Her name is Masy. We hope and pray she gets better and doesn’t relapse.
No money in CURES, only treatments!! Corrupt greed!!
You don't go to heaven for being good, there are millions of good people in hell. The only way to heaven is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ you can't get yourself there. Romans 10:9. If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved, just remember if you don't believe in God but think your a good person and that if heavens real that your gonna go there cus your a good person your going to hell
Just heard My uncle has only 3 months left from stage 2... pray please❤️
Much respect, mom passed from cancer and my father has cancer now.  Love your music
Sadly there's a cure for this disease but there's no money in a cure 😔
Amazing
3,000 dislikes from Phizer..
You need to do a collab with brabo gator man!
Yo this guy tom is amazing
Wow.
I notice that there are several thousand "thumbs downs" for this video.  What in the actual fuck?  This is a GREAT song and video.
Love you Tom ❤️ your a god in the rap game! Come back to Tallahassee Florida 🙂
leful imagine dying... cringeeee
My mom just found out she has breast cancer so this hits home.....
I keep coming back to this... it hurts me, and it is brilliant,,,it extolls the human soul... Tom, you got to me
Damn. That one got me. This is probably the fourth song I’ve listen to from this guy… That one got me. Shout out Tom MacDonald you’re the man.
Sorry, but this is ignorant, I don't mean that in the generically offensive way, but in the, you legit don't know what you're talking about here, like most people. It's not your fault really, it's just its never really talked about or used to mess with people, so a little help...  1. Cancer is not "Cancer". It's not a disease in that you catch it, or hardwired into our genetics, but rather its the result of a glitch in a cell which triggers, ironically, the mechanism that controls when a cell reproduces and dies to go out of control essentially making the cell immortal. Its caused from living and cellular damage from natural processes just not being perfect, radiation damage, a cell being in a place or structure which causes the cell to glitch, among a few other things. So when you get "Cancer" it's actually getting 1 of hundreds of cataloged variations on the things that caused that glitch to occur in a given place. Think of it more like "The flu" which you know is not 1 disease but thousands.  2. The "Cure" for cancer. Now that you should understand a little of what cancer actually is you should understand why there is no "Cure" or rather there is, for many cancers there are cures. Some that are really stupidly simple like moving a cell into an alternate alignment with the other cells around it which causes a chain reaction that fixes all the cells that cell has caused to go cancerous. Others have 0 chance of curing because by the time it presents symptoms the only thing that could be done would be to cell by cell rip it out of very difficult places . Our technology is getting to the point where we can do that, but it's not a "medicinal" issue but an engineering issue which is hard to solve. There are lots of things in the works though, like funny enough Coronavirus has taught the medical community a few new tricks which could lead to far better treatment because it can more easily target a cancer cell with poison/radiation without accidentally hitting healthy cells. Also... think about how impossible you probably think immortality is to get. Cancer is essentially the key to immortality, or at least part of it, so if we were to "cure" it... all of them... we would likely also have the tech for immortality.  3. "We made our world carcinogenic". No. This is the part about bad journalists like to mess with people comes in. Every thing is technically carcinogenic because every action you take, every interaction that is had with the world, slightly damages and wears on your body. This wearing of the body causes the need for it to be fixed and in fixing there is an associated probability that the cell "mutates" and becomes cancerous. Considering this is the baseline, it becomes obvious that anything other than dying causes cancer, it's just a matter of how much cellular damage then each thing does that needs to be weighed to say how carcinogenic it is.  Anyways, know this is probably more an emotional song and understanding these things don't make for quite a good emotional hit, but, maybe this knowledge will help someone, after all one of the biggest indicators of survival is dealing with cancer knowledgeably and practically. So may this info will help save someone's life or stem the tide of anger of thinking "why all this research has come to nothing". It hasn't. It's just a long road which we humans aren't too familiar with lately.
I have inoperable brain cancer. Treatment is dim. This song is truth!!
First song in a while to make me shed a tear. That's good.
I'm not getting any alerts from YouTube, but definitely listening to this again
Tom you da man
Absolutely love this song. There’s so much truth in this song! How could anyone dislike this? Love Tom Macdonald. His songs are great!
A friend of mine was diagnosed with cancer just a couple weeks ago, CANCER BLOWS
I think it was 10 years ago that Chris Rock did a stand-up bit. "There's no money in a cure, the money's in the medicine." Last thing we cured was Polio back in the 30's
Super cool dude with extreme lyrics thank you time
Tom please please pleaseeeee do the K Koke - KokeSpiracy theory challange!! Your the realist rapper in the world, i couldn't think of a better person to do it!!!??
I know where I'm going when I die, right to Jesus. I'm very sick with my autoimmune system attacking my body. And now, some of my doctors suspect cancer. I'll find out in January. Guess what? I'm not afraid at all! I'm blessed because this has drawn me closer to Jesus than anything could ever have. View my testimony posted on my channel. In Jesus is hope folks, no where else. I can't imagine going through any of this without Him.
My uncle did not tell anyone how he felt and he hid that he was sick then when he finally went to the docters 10 minutes later we found out he had cancer that same day he passed
WOW! Tom MacDonald I have been there with a few people! This song made me cry! You are amazing! DON'T EVER STOP BEING A WARRIOR FOR TRUTH!
Quand les autres rappeur passent du temps à faire le buzz sur des hits qui n'ont pas de sens #Macdonald lui passe son temps à divulguer la réalité que les gens ont vécu #chapeau à toi l'ambassadeur des rappeur big up for you from #Senegal_west_africa ✊✊

You and your girl are truly inspiring as artists...and human beings. Thank you.
I felt this to my heart my mom has stage 3 cancer and has her surgery in 9 days. Can we please get a prayer?
I beat brain cancer stage 3 6 years ago thank you tom
It’s like he’s in my head and taking all my thoughts and is able to musically express them ❤️🙏🏼
December 31, 2017. I miss my grandpa.
Protect Tom Macdonald at all costs
My mum has cancer I just found out she doesn't want to do kemo anymore she has given up this song hits hard
This song put tears in my eyes. We love you Tom. My sister is still fighting Cancer. This song went straight to the heart. I loss to many to Cancer
I feel like it's been a long time since you made this song every lyric is in my head
I just heard about him. Finally a rapper rapping about deeper topics than just 7 deadly sin flexing.
Tom MacDonald I just wanted to let you know this song hit so hard for me. Lost my mother in 2011 to cancer. I can say for 100% fact this song made me cry. Never been a huge hip hop fan, or rap. Just got into your music recently. This song Cancer, People are so stupid, and No Lives Matter are very good. Please keep telling the truth, you have one more fan for life. Thanks for all you do.
My thoughts and prayers for all those who have suffered, will, and those of our loved ones who stood/stand with them through it. My grandfather(my father's father) was diagnosed with prostate cancer before I was born ( In the late 1980s)and relapsed after my first two years on this earth. I was only 8 years old when he passed after a long battle with cancer in 1998. What it did to my grandfather seemed like nothing compared to the loss we all would feel by how his passing haunted the family. A giant wound remained and never healed thus “robbing" us kids of a wonderful grandfather and great memories of our father. Many times I was the only thing between my father and him wanting to end his pain.  Looking at it from the outside, how could you not be affected by the death of your father and be expected to raise two kids still at such a young age? Gives a whole new meaning to “depression" That type of pain I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. God bless you and all your fans, Tom!
23 years old and going through stage 2 testicular cancer right now. Treatment is finished and I go for scans this week to make sure it’s all gone. Thank you for this song Tom ❤️

Wow . You have a gift.  I am 60 years old you maybe the realist dude since Johnny Cash.
There are a few cures for many different cancers and preventative measures one can take to prevent or greatly reduce likelihood of it developing. The issue with "cancer research" is that there is no money to be made in a cure and they have a vested interest in keeping people sick with cancer because of the money that is made. The biggest problem is that there are so many things in our everyday life that cause cancer. Limiting those greatly reduces cancer risk. Anything from cell phones emitting radiation, wifi, Bluetooth, cell towers (especially new 5g), vaccines, genetically modified (gmo) food, chemicals and pesticides sprayed on food, heavy metals in water and prescription drugs and plastics just to name a few.     The main way in prevention is keeping your body in an alkaline state and avoiding foods that cause body to become more acidic. Cancer needs an acidic environment to survive and reproduce. In an alkaline state cancer is unable to reproduce effectively. Use alkaline water for everything from drinking to cooking and every thing else. Baking soda can be added to water to raise alkalinity (1/4 teaspoon per 32oz of water) Meat, eggs, and dairy are the most common foods that cause acidity in the body. The other most common is any refined sugar (cane sugar, honey, fructose, high fructose syrup) and anything containing those like any sweets( candy, soda, cookies) just to name a few. Type in "alkaline food chart" on any search engine for a guide to this. Most are not aware of this but sugar actually feeds a fuels cancer so elimination of sugar in cancer patients is a MUST DO.        One of the cheapest and easiest ways to kill cancer that is very effective is baking soda. Yes that powder that is 79 cents per pound found in every single grocery store. I personally know people who have used baking soda to rid their body of cancer and are still cancer free. They take 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon in 8 oz. of water 3 to 6 times a day. Baking soda changes p.h. levels to a more alkaline state. Another thing people have used to get rid of cancer is vitamin b17 mainly from apricot seeds. Turmeric with black pepper (for higher absorption) has worked in preventing and killing cancer cells. High dose vitamin c has also been known to kill cancer. There is an I.v. form of vit c that works much better than oral but vit c should be taken every day regardless of the form. Consuming foods high in antioxidants is VERY important. Every thing from turmeric with black pepper, berries like blueberries and acai, lemon and ginger, and vitamin c are just a few antioxidant rich foods.    Last but not least, cannabis and cannabis products have been known to kill cancer cells. T.h.c. is the main thing that does this but having other cannabinoids (c.b.d. or c.b.n.) along with t.h.c. can strengthen that. I know this was a super long comment but I felt the need to share for those who may not have known. Don't just take my word for it though, do your own research on those and come to your own conclusion. I hope this helps and is able to help anyone or loved ones with cancer looking for solutions.
I love your music Tom. First song I heard by you was bad news. Then it was sober. I have over 5 months clean from iv meth use. A good friend of mine shared this song with me knowing my dad passed of stage 4 lung cancer march 9 2020. Im crying right now cause it's so true!!
how is it that a Tom MacDonald song brings a tear to my eye

you need to check up what cancer is. it's not something that can be "cured" in the sense of curing bacterial infections or vaccinating against viruses.. it's a mutation in the cells, it's not something you can just "stop".
I just found out that my mom has cancer  I lost my dad to a heart transplant September 23rd...
Thank You for this song.
Cannabinoid treatments help cure cancer.
I HAD 3 MAJOR BRAIN SURGERIES THERE WAS TUMORS AND CANCER AND THEN THEY FOUND CANCER IN MY NECK AND TOOK OUT WHAT THEY COULD but now my cancer in my neck and brain are coming back full force but I got to live to see my son’s grow up
Keep doing you bro your more of what we need in these dark times in our lives Much love and Respect Family
My husband and I were married in April 2020 and in July we found out he his bone cancer and its terminal it's the roughest thing. I just lost a dear friend this week to cancer this song is my go to song. Thank you tom for speaking the truth and pushing hope we all need it
Sadly they will never release the cure because cancer keeps the population numbers down.
The big C has taken so many members of my family. I know i will get it soon. I think it has been designed into our society for some sick reason.

I'm crying
Grandpa just died from cancer
My blood dad is dying now and i cant do nothing. He ready to go though. So im just trying to get peace and let him know I'll see him again.
Everybody knows someone who's sick Forty percent will get cancer, only half's gonna live Your mom and your dad and your sister stand inside a room And someone won't survive it, do you hope it isn't you? I swear that cancer has a cure, but they're refusing to make it They've done like forty years of research, ninety billion in donations We've been running for the cure and wearing ribbons for ages Why are people still going through radiation? It's fucking crazy Hundred billion-dollar industry, they can't afford to end it And nobody wants to die, our only option is to spend it We give anything to stick around for just another second Give a fortune to the doctors who promise they can extend it The profits are astronomic, the hospital and the clinics Of fillings coffins with dollars, it's awful, let's just admit it We're all human, we'll keep fighting 'cause it's how we survive But it's scary 'cause we don't know where we'll go when we die  Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart  Nothing matters if you don't have your health All the money in the world doesn't help The good might go to Heaven and the bad might go to Hell But no one wants to leave here, you can tell And cancer touches everyone, it's in our genetics And our world's become so toxic, it's all carcinogenic We've polluted the water, the air; the food we're ingesting Is full of hormones and poison, our population's infected They sell us cigarettes and liquor, built a business on addictions We've been paying them to kill ourselves, we're dying to keep living It's the system, it's a prison, we keep trying to beat it We get cancer from keeping all of our demons a secret And our insurance don't cover the things we need to defeat it And even if it does, then we might die from the treatment Our best defence is living like we do not know what cancer is Fight it if you have it and pray that there's something after this  Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart  You won't know how to be brave Till you choose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength Till you struggle to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith Till you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take Till you realize you didn't break  Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart
I never though a Tom Macdonald song would make me cry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVrd1hWVpls
Theres no money in a cure. Only treatment that's why. Both my parents had cancer. My dad several times. Its all a scam
Everybody knows someone who's sick Forty percent will get cancer, only half's gonna live Your mom and your dad and your sister stand inside a room And someone won't survive it, do you hope it isn't you?

This is a beautiful song ❤️❤️❤️ Truly appreciated mane well said, be blessed in lightning us, Be blessed
I love this song, in 2018 I was informed by the docs that I have cancer. So far things are good, but this song really does bring me to tears.
I lost people to cancer. My Mom, my Grandma, close friends. My best friend is on chemo for years now, had multiple sever surgeries performed on him and he never complains even just once. I for myself had two cancer surgeries in the past, including a chemo and radiation therapy  along with them. People often say they are not afraid of death. Wait and see how this attitude changes when your number comes up in his book and then we talk again. Nuff said.
Its not long before more of the world wakes up to him🔥this king cant be ignored anymore..his talent is something unmatched👏💯👑
Fucking love this thank you so much for the song my cousin had brain cancer been fighting it for 3 year n it always a waiting game @tom Macdonald
Speaking the truth Tom 💯 exposing the system
Awesome song man. I myself have brain cancer and this song just hits home. Thanks for the strength!!!
This song boots a different type of vein
I love this song
Yo man I relate with this song I just got told I have Leukemia and I am having a baby boy as well so I don't know how to feel about everything at the moment because I am losing more then gaining lost my car because my father in law is crazy and sabotaged it and lost my job because I was in the hospital so I'm trying to keep fighting
Ps my mommy needed this. Thank you. I'm in tears She is all I have left. Grands gone. Kids well their are kids But I cant lose my mom too  Lost my Grandma in September Tom. Satan is working on us..I was surprised  by this video but my relationship with God is solid an I know my Moms will beat this garbage. Again thank you. I may have 15 plus yrs on you but you are very inspiring! So please don't stop Please   Please!
My mom  . .. Breast cancer! Grandma lung. They the big wigs dont gaf!
You ever see a bunch of clowns in a tiny car? Who's driving? Nobody knows. That's basically how the cure for cancer is. Apparently cancer thrives in a more acidic environment,  so maybe, just maybe,  a more alkaline place for the cells will over time kill them off. Like I said, Who's driving the clown car? But at this point, any effort is better than none at all.  Btw, my grandmother died from pancreatic cancer, and my mother and her twin sister both have aggressive lymphoma.
This is amazing and very inspirational. Keep up the good work Tom.
I have been able to shrink my tumors and they are shrinking more every day (by leaps and bounds).  At this rate they should hopefully completely disappear within the next couple of months. I was diagnosed with a stage 4 Her2 positive breast cancer (fairly fast moving) and Chemo is not the answer for most cancers, there is a much better way -- most people do not survive it long term and hundreds are curing themselves naturally. Check out "Chris beat cancer" and how he did it....I am also curing myself of a stage IV that had mestastasized to my lymph nodes and hip joint by flooding my body with nutrition/wonderful supplements and juices!!
only song i cant lisen to for A bad resons
My friend just died a month ago from cancer 3 days after his 22nd birthday and it really fucking sucks.
My Lord this guy is amazing. I hope he skyrockets.
Legend 💯💯💯💯💯
Realest rapper ever. Hell, just the realest ever. Also, who else could find a way to flow with carcinogenic? Talent right there bro
Respect to this it touched my heart lost lost two people to this Evil thing and it means lot that you made something like this my hat goes off to you my friend much love 💜🙏🏻
he turned into a preacher
Love it!! You are true inspiration to those in need, i love your work and would love to see more!!
i actually cried, this curse has touched so many lives, thank you Tom, for such a powerful message / track
HEAT
God Bless you Beautiful song and I agree they need to stop with money when it comes to sick children are Loved ones reward the workers with gift cards. And vaccinations and start putting the Real cure out to Help this Makes me tear up my Heart Goes to all the people that Have cancer and to my Loved ones I Lost it's so Heartbreaking prayers to Everyone and Hugs keep your Head up I Love How He is Real and speaks the truth and fights for what's right if I was A medicine maker and Doctor I would make it the right kind and Give it free to all patients who need it forget money on that it's about peoples Lives not money God Bless tom
First time I've cried without being physically hurt in a year thanks .You are a role model human if we was all u we would a a single organism as humans should be not making each other pay to see another day.
I just found this guy. I've yet to hear a song I don't like and I've been playing his songs back to back all day. This song has tears running down my face. Heart touching to everyone.
Dude, I cried when i watched/listened to this. After everything people told me about smoking...... All the video exaples of a smokers lungs..... everything i was told in school about smoking, Tom is the only person that made me quit..... smoke free for about a month now. Thank you Tom.
Barbara Bare smallcell carcinoma May 18 1944 September 23 2015  Much love More light Stay up
I'm not crying, you are
My dad died from the cancer the 🇺🇸 us government gave him. They gave it to him and did nothing to help. Im sure they know the cure, big pharma just won't let us have it.
I've told myself If I ever get cancer, I will not get treatment. I will just live life, enjoy my time with my family and most importantly my kids. People who get treatment are so brave.
Ngl this hit me hard in the feels
I lost my dad last spring to lung cancer, and now my sister has breast cancer. This really hits home 😥
Just found out today that my Dad has the rarest type of thyroid cancer-anaplastic thyroid cancer- and he was given 4-6 months to live with treatment.  He has always been my best friend, the best Dad, he was there always- my Mom was a abusive waste of space...he has had 8 heart attacks and survived those, and now cancer is going to take him in 6 months or less? I'm beyond heartbroken.  I have uncontrolled seizures,  and I don't work or drive (per my Dr.s) and he's always helped me get where I need to go.  We're literally so close. Great relationship and I am so thankful for having such a wonderful Daddy. I'm not ready for him to go...I'm scared...  Hug your loved ones, the people that you appreciate,  and tell them over and over how much you love them.  Because you never know how quickly something like this can happen.  4-6 months...🥺💔  God bless anyone who has lost someone to cancer or who is currently dealing with cancer.  🙏🙏💗
Right in the feelings
This man needs to be on the radio
He touched a lot people with this.....not many artist can connect on a real level with fans....Tom always humble, best alive hands down....not Eminem and all the bullshit he spits, there's a new King in the game!
Lost my old man last year to pancreatic cancer :/.. it’s. Unbelievable to digest the fact that the medical system in our own country try to hide the truth from you . I have a video called “THE PANCREATIC KAISER EFFECT “ and I tell the story of my old mans horrific short battle with pancreatic cancer .
My brother died of brain cancer and this hit hard!!
I agree with most of his messages; but I don't like the music. Sounds like some BS Christian rap.
So he's saying they could have a cure for cancer but wouldn't want to release it.  That just stupid if someone had a cure they would make a ridiculous amount of money, people aren't looking out for their competitors.  Great message to send out, some people in this comment action acting like this guy operates on another level or something.
I myself am a cancer survivor ! Within the last year my family has been through hell with my health , i was diagnosed with Leukemia in September 2019. January 2020 we celebrated the birth of our second child . April 2020 after months of chemotherapy and heartache we received news that i was finally in remission!  I wasn't a rap fan until I found Tom's music.  I guess I'm still not a rap fan but im 100% a Tom Macdonald fan ! Tom, if you see this , please know that your music helps get me through alot of tough times ! Much respect man ! Keep doing you brother !
What I don’t get is, doesn’t radiation cause mutations? Isn’t that why we fear nuke’s? How is radiation supposed to fix it when it causes the problem of cancer?
https://youtu.be/7JBHyE18L3o
How can someone make this wholsome of a song and get any disrespect. This man is a legend. Love you Tom
Just started getting into this guy Tom Macdonald and must say every song is great and I'm glad I gave him a listen
Epic!!
He speaks the truth in his music and that's why I like his music.
❤
Why is he not doing way bigger numbers then this ??
I really like this song and gets the point but not everything has a cure...it's science, not magic. I hope there is a cure...but just because we spent so much on it doesn't mean it will come true...our science nowadays can't fix everything and maybe it just takes time or luck for us to find a cure
lmao
Damn this hit home, I haven't cried in years but this brought tears to my eyes. I've been given less than 24hrs to live 3 times in the last 14 years of my life. I'm 34 now, have 2 8 year olds to watch over, I still get up every morning and go to work like nothing is wrong, I can't lose the fight, I just lose organ after organ and keep pushing myself. Now the tears really are flowing. Thanks Tom.
Great song! Lost my best friend to brain cancer! 😪
To the omes that give a f.... I have a testimony
This song is both beautiful and hard for me to listen to , I lost my grandmother to cancer a few years ago , when we found out she had it she only lived a few months , it had taken to much out of her body that she wasn’t even strong enough for treatment , I stood in that hospital when my mama had to make that hard choice to take her off live support   I was truly blessed to have her as a grandmother and she had even been with us when I had my daughters , with my oldest I was living in pa and she was living in fla and yet still sent me flowers while I was recovering, I was blessed they was able to know and love her since I know not every child can meet a great grandparent but I was happy my girls got to know how wonderful a grandmother she was  💓   When I think about her now I try not to think about her in that hospital but instead every wonderful memory she left behind and I know she’s with me now in spirit 💓  So thank you for doing such a beautiful song for people who are fighting it    I pray everyone who has it  is able to get help 🙏🏻  And for anyone who has lost someone I am sorry :(
Now there’s nano bots
awaken your kundalini, and conquer the devil(negative thoughts in yourself). To overcome all disease. Keep your feet on the ground and be in balance.
You’re always spitting facts 🔥 there’s gotta be a cure out there and they’re hiding it so they can keep taking our money...
Tom this song speaks yo me so strong. You see im 24 years old.. I have a 3 years old son.. I got told i have cancer.. But there isnt a cure.. The treatments are to subside the cancer for some time. But as of right now i have only a max of 6 years..
Hello everyone. Come watch my newest video “IM TIRED OF TOM MACDONALD AND HIS RAPS” where I tell you why I am sick and tired of Tom MacDonald and his rapping and rap videos. —CodyTheKingOfYoutube
My grandma had cancer twice and my coach had got it
I don't know how Tom macdonald doesn't get any recognition he should be the number one artist and if he dies then I hope the world changes and I hope he does a huge impact of the human race 🙏
How the fuck does this guy get 3k dislikes per video its because hes killing it n people are mad
Cancer is a billion dollar business, so do you real think they would give us a cure .
I’ve lost so many people to cancer.. this song breaks my heart. Thank you Tom, that was amazing.
If we cure cancer, the population would explode even more than it already is. Cancer is the lesser of two evils.
My mom is a 2 time breast cancer survivor and this song touches home every time I hear it. Thank you for everything tom!!
I have no idea if anybody else caught this or if I'm stretching it. But back when tom released no response i think he might of hinted to this song comin. Look for the stacked tragic millions. If you go past 1:10 in no response you've gone to far to find what i speak of.
Jesus is the only answer! He has a place for us if you except His free gift of grace!
My older brother passed away almost a decade ago from cancer. He’d been having complications with his heart for almost a year before the doctors cared enough to look into it further. By that time he was already in stage 4 with months to live. The doctors convinced him  to throw thousands of dollars of chemo treatment at it and even convinced him to do an experimental treatment. That treatment costed somewhere around $20,000 per dose and it took less then a weak to kill him. Help out those who are going through cancer and make the most of your time with them.
Its the foooood they are feeding us!!! Wake up to the ones sleeping
It’s the vaccines, the food, the pharma drugs, the EMF waves, the aerosols in the sky.
I did, I hated on this guy at first, for no reason. It says a lot more about me. Thank you, Tom. For making me take a long look at myself. Thank you for your music, man. I wish everyone in the industry was like you. All of your music is so vastly different than what we're used to. All your songs pack a punch to the gut. So much truth. Bruhh,  thank you for being a voice... You're becoming a cultural icon... Keep hittin' the gas! You're blowing up!
My 2 1/2 year old brother died of cancer. I was 13 I’m 36 and still cry 😢 knowing how much he suffered being such a little baby. I remember seeing kids that I would meet at the children’s hospital and than finding out they died by seeing a white rose on a podium in the Ronald McDonald house. When it was my brother who passes I remember walking to the podium and seeing his name with his white rose at the podium. I’m sorry D.J. I feel like such a weak person because you suffered and I’m just here.
I can't believe, am crying 😢 😢
The cinematography fucking broke me... I lost my step-dad to cancer in December of 2017. Even though I know they're actors, I can feel what that family is going through...
the message this song sends actually makes me cry
This makes me MISS MY MOM Thank you Tom McDonald its been many years but will never forget the three weeks i got to spend with her before this cancer took her life..My life is less with out HER
A week ago my dad lost his battle with pancreatic cancer. I had the chance to let him hear this song. He was a fighter! Thank you for this song i I hope it will touch many people like it touched me. Thank you!!! Rip dad you fought one hell of a fight! Love ya
I watched my father go from a strong independent no help needed type of man to being unable to even feed himself. Radiation is such a barbaric treatment, it eats you alive just as much if no more than the cancer itself it’s time for change
Hes been growing rapidly for a couple years. Getting a gold play button on a self made music page ain't that easy to do.
My younger brother at the age of 22 was diagnosed with two types of blood cancer and yeah we all thought he wasnt going to make it. I was his donor for a stem cell transplant and to have that opportunity to help my little brother changed my life. The treatment was a success and he now is 26 years old with a 4 year old daughter and is going strong so to anyone who knows someone with any cancer please stay strong and never give up. My thoughts are here for anyone who has to go through this cruel disease
"Paying them to kill ourselves, we are dying to keep living"  🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
I lost my mom to breast cancer 2 years ago. Thank you for such a real song about cancer! Anyone fighting cancer watching this.... keep fighting. Your not alone!
Why the hell did 3k dislike this I mean the political I still dount understand because it's facts but if you dislike this your a hell of a bad person.
Wow!  Respect for Tom just leveled up.
I'm 47 and have always been big into music... This song is without an equal...  Tom, God has given you a true gift.. Keep using it!... People are being blessed.
My dad has a braintumor... he’s in his last fase... im so scared i dont know what to do 😔
Just lost my grandma to cancer and just found this song. Thank you for putting into words how my family and i felt throughout the years. Keep it up and prayers and good vibes to all those going throught it or have been through it love you all
💗 love to all those dealing with cancer. And fuck big pharma. There is a cure. These ppl are murders.
This guy is fucking underrated
Came here over your "No lives matter" and thought: brave song, good message.  Discovered this. Just want to say: thank you. Yes, people right now are dying by cancer because they arent going to take their small chance fighting it, because of "the Virus". In Germany, we had a stunning 34% less request of cancer treatments over this year.  This song, this message is great. Thank you. I really hope it inspires people to keep up the fight if they can and find peace if there is no more fight. Bless you for it, and bless all taking the message in.
The more I listen to Tom the more I love his music.
This hit home my cousin will be 10years cancer free in December 😄 your songs rule
🥺💞
Why does this song get 300 dislikes?!  Wtf !
My Grandpa died 4 months ago due to lung cancer is a 2-year battle I didn't cry once but this song brought tears to my eyes.
Hard to watch, but it is an amazing song
If you didn’t cry or tear up during this, you ain’t human man... 🥺😭
My mom has cancer..  her surgery is scheduled (again) for this Tuesday... Nov 24 (I think that's the right date..) but this is her second round with cancer... First it was a tumor above her eye... And now there is a tumor the size of a baseball on the side of her face..  this is after she survived triple bypass surgery on her heart..she was having a heart attack for like...18 days...and lived to tell the tale.... And an aneurysm surgery in her gut...  She's getting older ...and I'm so worried she isn't gonna keep making it thru these surgeries.... So whatever God or Gods or Goddesses or whatever deity etc of love and light  you believe in... Please... pray for my mom... Send good vibes guys .. I know you don't know me from Adam (or Eve in this case I guess...idk if there's a turn of phrase for women like that) but please.... Send my mom good vibes... Her last surgery got cancelled cuz her blood pressure was too high and they didn't feel safe going thru with it.... She stopped smoking...like a few years ago when she found out about her heart..   She hardly spends time in the sun... She doesn't deserve this... She escaped an abusive relationship...she met my dad and when pregnant with me found out my dad was terminally ill...he died 2 days after his birthday in 2017 (I was 26 at the time which is WAY more time than we thought we had with him...but he suffered so much everyday...) My mother has been thru so much.... So please... Please.... Send her good vibes.... She had to leave her 2 children behind to escape before... Because they were from a small town and he had everything and everyone wrapped around his fingers.. there's so much from her childhood that is heartbreaking... And then from 2013-2018 had me fucking up addicted to drugs... Stealing from her and my dad... (I'm not proud of it...but I am proud I came out the other side.... Not without almost dying myself and having a heart valve replaced and a pace maker for life...) She's been thru enough.... So please... Pray, send good vibes...whatever you got... This may sound like a lot of bullshit but it's not.... Some people just have all the shitty luck..  and that's my mom... My whole family really...but especially my mom... And she keeps going... Strong.... So anyways.... This song touches my life...and I am grateful for you Tom...and for the people reading this comment.... Again....send good vibes to my mom this Tuesday.... Cancer sucks! 💯
i never really actually listen to your music until today, i only just heard of you. this one made me cry! i love your music bro 100
All these comments are making me cry at work. Damn.
I lost my Dad at 18 and My Mom at 21.. I was in the Army at the time and glad between the Army and the Red Cross they got me home to be with them before they passed away.. This Song makes me feel so much bro
My wife's step mother has been battling cancer for so many years now she has been called dragon slayer by the doctors. The cancer keeps coming back no matter how many treatments she gets. This song came out and once my wife and I heard this song we both started crying because it really hit home. Thanks Tom for this song.
I held the strongest man I've ever known's hand while he passed from stage 4 cancer. 7 days after he was checked into the hospital for stomach pain he passed away. My father-in-law was a great man, and I wish everyday that he could have met his granddaughter. She has his name, to carry on his strength. I didn't have a father growing up and this man took me in from the first day I walked in with his daughter to meet him and his wife. The years I got to know him I cherish because I learned so much in that time on how to be a man and how a man should act. This song just popped up and made me think about him. I miss my friend, my wife misses her dad. He lives on through memory that will only be of the great man that he was. To all of those fighting this fight, we love and support you and never give up the fight. To those who have lost someone close to cancer, my heart is with you and your family. Great song. Miss you brother, I'll see you down the road
This song always hits me hard.  I've lost so many family members to this tragic disease. I've thought the cure is kept from us for a while now glad to see I'm not the only one.
Why tf 3k ppl disliked this!?
It's taken me some time to gain the strength to listen to this one but I'm glad I did.  I lost my Dad to cancer when I was 18.  I'm 36 years old today and some days it's still not easier.  Thank you Tom for this beautiful piece.
My guy is on a GRIND
Lost my grandpa in February heart attack. Hes like a dad to me get tonwork tonight mom calls my gram has breast cancer gonna kill me something happens to her too
I lost my grandpa to kidney failure. Then his only brother got cancer. My mother in paw. Both terminal. My wife lost a cousin to it a while back. It's like play russian rulet with out knowing it.
3K anti-human misguided bots disliked this video.... We all need to untie to break the matrix of lies that push this agenda. Once again amazing work to wake the sheep up Tom!
This one hits to close to home for me, about 2 and a half years ago I lost my grandad to pancreatic cancer which was the hardest moment that I've had to go through in my life and I still haven't fully gotten over it.
110% true.
Fuckin love you mang!  Hangover gang for life!
how much more can i say on this.... um you are killing me , you are 100% true,,, and dammit.. you are a light in the world
This killed me. Love you to the moon and back sister my heart breaks more today than it did the day you left us and tomorrow will hurt even more just another day without you no new memories
My mom loves this song
Built businesses out of addiction man I wonder how many have have died from everything in this song...
There are many ways to cure cancer. Check out Ty Bollinger. Hes done years of research on alternative cures.
Jesus says it's ok look He has over come this world Soo live with no worry's
Paying them to kill ourselves that's crazy so crazy don't give up stay strong .. Vengeance is for the Lord... Hottest parts in hell is waiting for the liquor lord's
Child hood cancer probably caused by vaccines
Love your music
This tho omg 🥺❤️😭
miss you grandmal
Aww poor baby is begging for likes with a song about cancer after spewing hate towards every possible minority for the past year straight. C'mon Tom the mainstream doesn't hate you you're just a bigot 😂
I fu$%ing HATE CANCER!!
Shoo, Powerful
How can people have the audacity to dislike this video??? This song legit is here to help people get through a really tough time, no reason to dislike, like wtf.  If your fighting cancer or has someone who is I pray you'll get through it and come out stronger than ever
I lost a cousin that I was close to and my dad lost his best friend to pancreatic cancer. This song has struck a nerve in me.
Beautiful 💖
I burn brighter in the dark
this video is so on point!
You yes you irreplaceable Man
Right, doctors are the enemy....good message
If you feel like you messed up, there are people that disliked
My 8 year old daughter was diagnosed with Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma literally that day after this video was posted. It's been a really tough month. What we/she has been through in just 4 weeks has been insane. We've had to fight to get her the best treatment and care every step of the way. This song gets me every time. She has a facebook page if you want to follow her story. SamanthafightsFHC. It's such a rare cancer, 1 in 5 million, especially for a child her age that had a healthy liver. We love your music , keep singing the truth!💜🙌
I agree with everyone on this comment page! Tom is a gift from God
7 years ago today my grandfather died after several years fighting cancer... I was the last person he ever spoke to. Cancer is such bullshit! And I definitely agree you Tom, there HAS TO BE a cure out there! They're just not releasing it for selfish reasons. Which if that turns out to be true is disgusting.
Fuck you Tom for making me cry. Dope song bro. This is so true. Theres a cure but the industry makes too much money on keeping us sick. I hope you become a worldly superstar that generations listen to. You spit the truth.
I lost my mom my grandma and my grandpa to cancer it truly sucks so much I miss them so much
My wife just finished chemo & radiation she’s been battling since last year November she never complains went right back to work immediately even during this cova crap i’m in tears right now you got me I didn’t expect this she’s so strong the only time she ever cried was when she lost her hair I’m strong for her but when I’m alone sometimes I cry but I don’t let her or our 7 yr old son see it God bless you and everyone who is going through this hang in there
Glad this was recommended to me I needed this
Wow what a beautiful message!! 😭🙏💪
Thank.
💛
My grandmother told me grandpa's last words were him asking my cousin if it was raining right before he died of lung cancer
Mate,im 6 months into a battle with a brain tumour, this song cuts me up every time I listen to it but I can't stop listening it's so true, love your music
DOCTOR ROBERT PRATHER
Weed can cure cancer its scientifically proven
Man, could have used this two years ago
This hit home HARD
Pls no.
They do have the cure. those Doctors had to exile to South America something like this.
Tom go crazy bro
I love you Tom, you are risking it all for us man...you touch mind, body, and soul sir every release of a new song...but most of all sir you lasso the fuck out of our hearts man. I love you, and if or when they come for you man just know you'll have army to back you. Inspiration from love is a better look for us all and with your  positive influence we gonna level every wall. Oh yea my mother just woke from having her cancer removed....it's beyond an understatement too say this song has for weeks now set the mood. Just know we or me myself individually are here for you as you are us all. If you need me/we make the call....Love and respect to you and yours brother pls don't stop your campaign your selfless March, brother your beats are the rhythmic resonance....the trumpet sounding as the REVOLUTION sparks. Thank you for putting the world on your shoulders and fighting all our demons....an actual reason to continue dreaming...not just another gluttonous constituent...petrodollar schemin...no replacement or refresh cog in the division mechanics of this strategical two party system. A Longtime slicing of our wrists, with the unraveling papyrus scroll....of an elitist Christmas list. Until Dr.Tom I ain't no pawn McDonald swooped in...sutures the wound and gives it a neosporin kiss. Lifts our chins back up, and says now we rebel on this reality based pastime of the boardgame Risk. So with a rebel yell or simple tisk tisk we begin cracking elitist heads like eggshells...into the frying pan, high heat whisk whisk...purposely forgetting butter like Percy forgetting to wet the sponge, this omelet will burn black, as Tom yells "Roll On One" in a Big John Coffee tone...Boss our work is done. Sorry Tom you got me in the zone lol I'll say I love you once more and leave you and the other fans on here the fuck alone lmao....
Real recognize Real Tom
Tom..... i love your music!!!!!!!
This hits home, our daughter got a large teratoma tumor last year in April at 13 years old. It crushed me so hard i could barely stand,eat, for days and I couldnt drive for atleast 3 days. I had to literally have someone else drive me around to get the things she needed.  But in June 2020 we got the all clear and no longer have to go to the oncology ward for blood tests, and imaging labs.  It is the greatest gift we have ever received, and I am thankful everyday many of the kids we saw during our visits wont make it. We never posted about it on our channel, because she wanted privacy. But for everyone out there going through this there is hope.   She even won a hockey tournament as the MVP of the tournament in march and she was the only girl on the ice. We have a video of the entire championship game on our channel. She is amazing.  Sorry for rambling i dont write these kind of posts normally.  Hoping the same recovery for all of you.  Seize the day each and everyday-Are Jay
Cancer has been around since 1600 B.C. and there is still no cure
I cried.... I lost my grandpa due to lung cancer.
My Dad passed away from cancer last September so this hits ☝️
this hit the feels hardcore!!! Amazing work Tom!
5676977 the cure is out there this is the patten number for the cure for aids check it out
My baby died from hospital mistakes and bugs not  the cancer she was battling
My dad died at 42, I looked after him until he died, 40 years of donations and no clue to a cure, endless charity fundraising, donations, people leaving money from their wils, come on there is truth to what he's singing about, ❤️
U are a beautiful human thank you for this song. I've lost so many of my family to Cancer 💔😥
Hope y’all have a good day!
Currently going through chemo. My youngest son went through it 2 years ago. My oldest son went through it 4 years ago. Thank you!
Damn
Lost my dad in September to stage 4 prostate, it just spread too far. It was thankfully considered a line of duty death for the Fire Department but that doesn't change the fact that I lost my best friend. He kicked its butt for 2 and a half years but it was just his time. Best man I've ever met and best role model that I could ever ask for. Closest thing to a real super hero that the world's ever seen🤙❤
...if you type in www.antifa.com it goes to Joe Biden official campaign website! https://youtu.be/slaANQU_ALM
Finally a rapper who sings about life problems
As a child currently fighting cancer I really appreciate this.
A month or so later, found out that I got a friend who got cancer a couple days ago, she didn't find out she had cancer until today when a nurse told her because the doctors lied and said it wasn't cancer. In my book it doesn't matter what the case is if somebody has cancer and u know it's cancer u fucking tell them it's cancer regardless if that got a high chance of survival
I have relapsed three times. The treatments are worse than the disease.
This song actually made me cry. I had 3 members pass away from Cancer. Thank you Tom for this, I feel like this was made for me. Love and Respect to you
fek, what a message, stunning, keep doing what your doing, so many powerful messages, with truth behind every one.
😭😭😭 Tom McDonald, you are awesome. 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
This is the most amazing 👏 music content of  this time!!!
Hey Tom Can I have permission (Your Permission) to do reaction videos like these to your music/music videos and videos too.  I’m asking because it’s polite and I also don’t want no more copyright issues any more.  I have been having copyright issues with other things I have tried to post on YouTube before. So I’m paranoid. 😁 Love the music man
Cried the whole time. Such a true song....
Only the good die young
This guy is definitely deserves the RESPECT 🔥💯
you 3k people  how don't like this it is not the song or the cause  it is you you don't like
It's amazing we don't have a cure for a disease we've thrown the GDP of a small nation at.  Great music as always.
I never dreamed this shit would happen to my family, at least not so early. Thank you for your song brother
Thank you for caring and be a great Human being
Looking for donations to help anyone who I meet with cancer that needs support. You can check my channel out. I’m a genuine person that just wants to help. We are all human beings and we all need support sometimes. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you need any support. As this is a new venture helping people. I’d welcome anyone who is also looking to help their fellow human being. Email me at alienama261@gmail.com and we can have a chat via video call or private message or we can talk on this.

So email at alienama261@gmail.com and we can chat about how you can help or what help you might need. I’ll do my best to help you
the cure was found in the 90s when i was a kid a st ambrose student found it and was only broadcasted once.. the quickly shut him up bc of big pharma... a cure is a super probiotic if they inject it around cancer it smothers and kills it.
Wish this song was around when my aunt had her first cancer diagnosis... unfortunately her cancer came back after finishing chemotherapy... and she passed away this year. But thank you for this song. So now future cancer patients can have a song to listen to to help them get through treatment. I wish cancer had a cure for it so it will never come back.
Yep I'm a fan!!!
Why did 3k dislike this thats like 3.1k to many
Here's part of the answer to why there is no cure (google it) - "NYPost: Biden Cancer Charity Spent More Than $3M on Salaries, Zero on Research, Grants". The president of the charity, a former Pfizer executive, Gregory Simon, reportedly received $429,850 salary during the 2018 fiscal year...
Search cancer there are two other songs called cancer by mcr and a cover by 21 pilots this is a okay song but those others are better
They'd rather spend the money on things like PreP... FailFish
I refuse to believe there is nothing after this. Especially for those that leave us under such circumstances. It's those who hurt so hard, that are the first to have everlasting relief
Hi Tom! This is AJ Syfers's mom. He is a big fan & turning  everyone he knows onto your music including me!  This video made me cry. I lost my significant other Dino to prostate cancer. Interesting one of the conversations we had before he passed away was why isn't there a cure? I told him the medical industry suppressed those cures. He told me if he's diagnosed with cancer he's not going through chemo or radiation. Cuz he had cancer in the lymph nodes before and he went through all that. My best friend Kat died of cancer as well. I can't tell you how many other people I personally knew and watch them go from vitally alive to walking Dead. To me the Cancer treatments that the medical establishment has is a premature death sentence.
Yo he is the only one that cares for this go tom macdonald plz keep writing
Pancreatic cancer took my pops and watching the fight he gave this song hits home
My mom has gone through two appearances of breast cancer, and just last week they found tumors on her brain. We don't know what happens next, but we knew from the start it was a battle you can't win. There's no excuse for no cure, only that it brings them too much money to get rid of it.
Beautiful.
POWERFUL
My uncle got skin cancer.. My aunt had breast cancer and died
wow..  this is something special. slowly turning into a big tom Macdonald fan.  its nice to see a rapper talking about the real issues not just rapping about guns and gold
Just lost my granny to cancer, it's rough watching someone die. Your words speak a resounding truth. Keep it up, this hit me right in the feels bro.
One word, Amazing!!!
This song gave me chills
My grandma will always be a walking miracle. Strongest woman I know. She beat 5 different cancers 5 different times. Stay strong gma.
Very powerful moving song. Thank you! ❤️🙏
Husbands aunt died from cancer 5 years ago. Was in remission and came back. Uncle died from pancreatic cancer 5 years ago...only made it a few money after diagnosis. 15 years ago lost my grandpa to stomach cancer only made it three months. I think about him all the time.
I never thought a socially responsible rapper who is creative and controversal all at the same time could exist.......nice to see some positive in this world full of so much hate and ugliness.     This guy will never get the mainstream credit he deserves....Im cool with that .......Independent means not having to sell your soul to industry.  Keep doing your thing Tom, we need more people like u in this world!
TOM! Do a song with Hopsin
Wow!  Powerful truth . Nuff said
Dude! I'm not one to cry, but you hit me in the feels. My Mom has cancer, I just lost my Aunt earlier this year and my wife lost her mom right before we met 16 years ago. Bless you so much for putting out music with meaning. Again, you hit me in my feels.
😢😢😢 👍👍👍👍
My friend's mother passed away from cancer a year ago. She was like a second mother to me, and I still miss her deeply. Every time she heard i was struggling with food she'd ransack her pantry just to make sure I could flourish and not flounder. She had battled with breast cancer twice and had beaten it the first time and received another several years in this earth. I'm so grateful to have known her💔❤💕
My dad had cancer and in 4 months he’s gone. I hate cancer....
He forgot to mention how the hospitals induce Cancer, only to make money from donations for Cancer Research that actually pockets for themselves, only to make the Cancer patients get stuck with a quarter million dollar debt.
You keep doing what you're doing tom We are here we are listening
lost a friend of mine going on 3 years ago to cancer. Just right after he graduated high school he passed. the great die young and it sucks, hold your loved ones close cause you don't know when something can happen.
Love Bro! living it. Thank you
Where is your covid song my dude?  You're the opposite of Marvin Gaye
My 5 year  old nephew beat it and relapsed this song hits  home base
Can we start a #ReleaseTheCureForCancer movement
This making me tear up I just found out family member Has cancer
This hit close to home I lost my dad to cancer in 2015 and having to see him go through everything he went through was so hard I can't image what it was like but just seeing him getting weaker and  weaker right before my eyes just hurt my dad was never the kind of guy who showed his pain and weakness he always acted tuff and didn't like to ask for help but hearing him ask me for help and seeing how he couldn't do much for himself after awhile just killed me I hated it for him and so badly wanted to take it all from him so he didn't have to deal with it 😭😭 there's not a day that goes by where I don't miss him and wish i could talk to him and hug him one last time
You can tell just by the look on Tom’s face, he either has had someone pass from cancer or just saddened by how bad the industry is
Jelly sent me here. 🔥🔥🔥🤘🤘
Damn Tom
Thank you for this. I've been that mother laying with my dying daughter in her hospital bed. She was only 8. Forever 8. I think you are right. I hate that they are not forthcoming. I think there's a cure but the treatment is their bread and butter. I miss my baby. Thank you for this song.
I had cancer.
Tom Macdonald 2024
oh my heart just went on full stop,  thank you sooo much for caring for us!   True American Tom Mc Donald
I feel it lost my father to cancer when I was 2 years old
Thank you Tom. My mother has two types of cancer she’s battling right now and I thought I was handling it good but I was wrong. Hearing this really put my head in a better place. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
How do people dislike this
I'm refusing the next round of chemo for my MS. Everything's poison these days.   Mind you I was blind and paralyzed this time last year. I couldn't get words out, I'd choke on my spit and water about a dozen times a day. Life was seemingly completely fucked.  I began eating strictly grass fed and finished beef 8 weeks ago, I eat liver and kidney raw every morning with some heart, bone marrow and bone broth. I'm back to being a functional human being, it's crazy.  If we avoid blue light, don't take pharmaceuticals and feed ourselves correctly we won't damage our DNA to the point of such crazy succeptabilites.  Be well everybody. And seriously, get blue light blocking glasses for any time you and your loved ones are looking at screens. Light your living spaces with UV light and some infrared. The LED and florescent garbage is poisoning people on a quantum level. It's that kind of deep.
I've looped this song dozens of times and the chorus makes me cry every time. Never give up. Never surrender. You got this, kid.
Thank you. This helps really. My uncle died of brain cancer 3 months ago, my aunt Susie is dying of esophageal cancer that they can't do anything about, and my 30 yr old sister just got diagnosed with ovarian cancer. I do think they could cure it. It's a billion dollar industry. I should know. I'm a critical care nurse. And things are worse than ever now.... so thanks for speaking out and always speaking from the heart.
You sir are a great man! We will fight for all I pray in the name of Jesus anyone on this post struggling be healed.
The government are lying to people about the cure to cancer they won't share it with the public because they are trying to get profit but about half the people in the world die because of it .it is really sad
ok, who down voted this video! own up!
This song really pulled on my heart strings. Good job. Thanks for making music with lyrics that actually matter.
He will never get on the big screen because its not in big musics companies interest .. this man legend .. fumny thing he getting bigger without the companies
Cancer sucks 😭
Love ya Tom.
I kinda cryed my brother has cancer...
I 100% agree Tom, great song and much love and respect to you and yours✌👊✌
Good lord I cried at this
Man.....I legit fell in love with his message.
Spitting big FACT'S 💯💯💯💯💯
this guy is hero
This is a very well made and beautiful song
cancer = b17 deficiency and acidic body chemistry
You can see the pain.... he’s losing someone to cancer and he feels helpless.  I’ve been there man Tom just keep you’re head up and love them why they still are here.  And make amends while you can.
Christ Fella way to light a issue here in the UK The unspeakable virus has spread now if you have caner your dead
Lost my dad when I was 4. Today I'm 33..
This was the song that led me to your music! I am living with emphysema and this song is very personal! #CanswerAnswers  Semper Fi
You realize that the "cancer" has a cure argument can be destroyed in a few sentences?  If you think it's all because of money then you're stuck looking at the issue with tunnel vision. If a company had a cure to cancer, they'd just charge even more and sell it. Not to mention out of the hundreds of thousands of humans involved in the research, several would speak up. Don't plant false hopes in individuals with cancer and make them upset about ideas that aren't true.  FYI there is no way to cure cancer without genetic engineering which is still somewhat in its infancy. However, there is a project that has been underway since 2016 iirc. An international team of the world's top scientists in the field met at Harvard behind closed doors then came out and announced the "Human Genome Project - write". The goal of this project is to create a living human cell from its basic raw chemicals. If successful it could help with cancer research and medications on an astronomical level and could help reduce the cost of genetic based work by a factor of 1000. Again iirc.  That being said, RNA based medications are being developed currently and one day, you may be able to just get a shot and cancer will go away. These medications are genetics based and designed to target specific cells. Think of a microscopic onion. Each layer has a function and the core is filled with medicine. The outside of the ball functions like a Trojan horse. It tricks its target into letting it bipass the outer wall. Once inside, it begins to destroy the target from within. Anyways, that's a ways away. Long ways. Companies only now recently created the first couple rna medications for diseases but not cancers. It's far more complicated than what I said. An interesting fact, the new Pfizer vaccine is a type of RNA based concoction. I think covid has been beneficial to the industry in regards to research. A lot of data and quick clinical trials will help us advance much quicker. Part of the issue is that there is so much red tape. Government gets in the way of everything. It often takes over a decade to get a new drug to market. Government mostly has a fetish for getting in everyone's way.
Dude you made me so sad but happy at the same time my momma is going though this and I truly needed it
This made me cry. I've never cried to a song ever!
"You burn brighter in the dark!!" Thank you Tom, I needed this.
sound therapy from the 80s was shown to destroy around 99% of cancer cells while not harming any normal ones.  its all about money, they are just starting to release it.  https://phys.org/news/2020-02-ultrasound-cancer-cells.html  also adding extra oxygen to your blood can all but cure Aids/HIV, they have been doing it in the UK for ages
There is not enough "like" buttons on this video!
I lost my father to a very rare aggressive cancer. The day we found out he had it they said go home we can't treat you you've got about 30 days left. That was a blow i never saw coming. It wasn't 30 days, it was 60 days of hell watching him suffer till his last breath.
Kick ass song! 👍
So true. These lyrics are artistic and spot on.   I lost my aunt Debbie to cancer. She beat it 3 times and died the 4th time it came.
The Global Elitists and the Multi Trillion Dollar Drug companies have a cure for everything,  but don't give a shit about anyone or anything because of greed and power!
Organic plant based diet can help prevent reverse ans cure cancer. People need to stop cancer where it starts. Man made toxins in almost everything.  I know people that cured themselves with just plants no toxic chemo
As a cancer survivor, from when I was 16-18, thank you Tom. We needed this.
hahahagaga
loooool
I believe we will go to jannah. Paradise. I'm Muslim. I hope I'll see y'all there :) spread love. Keep keeping it real
Bro!
Thank you tom my cousin died of cancer she was Perry county's face for a long time this means a lot to me and everyone else. Keep being you HOG till the end
I live every day with skin cancer.. they say my DNA mutated from a severe sunburn I got when I was 8 and again at 9 .. 38 years later, and I get diagnosed?   Thanks for this. 🙏
Prevention is the cure for cancer. America is a culture that promotes foods, music, mindset that is sure to give you cancer. If we put the right things into our minds and bodies we would all be healthy.
FACTS!!! THANK YOU!! 🙏
wow man you out did it this time
Built a business out of addiction we keep paying them to kill ourselves. 🙏true
My sister has just recently been cleared after treatment for Stage 4 cancer.  She is the inspiration and light for anything I could ever face, she never once backed down from the fight, always with a smile, a shear determination it wasn’t going to stop her.  Hearing this so closely after watching someone go through this for the first time in my life I can only say thank you.  This is as beautiful and truthful as a song can be.  Thank you.
My dad passed away seven years ago from stage four renal cancer. I think it's sad that so much money and research has gone into trying to cure cancer, and people still need chemo and radiation. I found out through researching cures, the Burzynski Clinic in Houston, Texas IS curing cancer. The reason people don't know about them is because there are people getting rich off of chemo and radiation treatments. If you, or someone you love has cancer, call the Burzynski Clinic and just talk to them! Look them up. It doesn't hurt to try.
Whoever thumb downed this video does not have a soul
WOW!! THANKS💜💜
Omg love this song! My brother-in-law was just diagnosed with lung cancer and there are so many cures! People should never stop looking becAuse these oncologists and Pharma criminals look at you just as another number and will poison you to death! We will fight and will win! So many cures, too many! Anyone searching don’t stop they exist they just hide them. It’s sickening.  Tom your an angel I love your sons and the truth you speak! God bless you
what is this? From Tom MacDonald? Both my parents had cancer(survived) and I've lost two friends to cancer... but it's whatever. I don't understand why this song was made though.  Was there cancer in Tom Macdonald's life?
I am a survivor of Leukemia BCell All. 6 years of hell. Your absolutely right. My insurance paid over a million in treatment and chemo destroyed my organs. Thanks for speaking for us my man.
First heard your music through nolifeshaq here on YouTube. This song hits me so hard because my wife is currently fighting stage 4 osteosarcoma. She got diagnosed at stage 4 6 months after we got married. This past August 18th was our 2 year anniversary and she's fighting so hard, it's amazing how strong she is. I know this song was meant for those fighting, but we as the people who are with those battling cancer, it's our fight too. Our fight to care for them, our fight to stay strong for them, our fight to keep them here with us. Thank you for making this song. There are no words to express how thankful I am for this song, you gave me even more hope with this song and the courage to continue to be strong for her.
@tommacdonald my mom beat stage one breast cancer and my aunt is dealing with stage two she just started her first week of radiation and she says she is fine but I can see it worries her. I'm gonna show her this when I see her to give her some more hope thank you for all your music
MY NIECE FOUGHT BONE CANCER SHE WON IT WAS SO HARD FOR MY SISTER AND NEPHEW. GOD IS SO GOOD NEVER GIVE UP. GOD BLESS HACKENSACK CHILDRENS HOSPITAL STAFF 🙏🙏
right in the feelings man, both my parents have been threw multiple bouts of cancer unfortunately my mom didnt make it. its so fucking hard to stay strong when you're watching a loved one die in front of you. all you can do is live you life as good as you can in their honor. two years have past and i've clawed my way from the bottom back up on my path to success. anyone else whos going threw this now stay strong and give that person the best end of their life as possible. it will be hard but you'll be thankful for it down the road
Thank you, hit close to home! Lost my father from Cancer last May.  Keep up the positive messages man! Your in my top list of artists!
My brother Kurt died in 2006 at age 27 and not long ago I found Burzynski I can tell you I've seen his cure work on people and if I get cancer I won't go out the way my brother did. I'll be headed to Houston. The man with the cure, also because Trump passed the right to try act you can go there without FDA approval
I know who has the Cure look up Stanislaw Burzynski Clinic, no radiation and no chemo. He found the cure in the 70s and has been silenced by the government constantly trying to take away his licence attempted to steal his invention they refuse to let him take credit for the cure so they suppress it instead. He provides it at his clinic in Houston TX. He is the man who has the cure.
It blows my mind this song has 3k dislikes.. Like what...? Either u agree or disagree with tom, cancer is horrible.... I'm still confused
My dad passed away from small cell lung cancer on October 25th after a 2 year fight. Every doctor pushed him into different treatments knowing it was gong to kill him. This song is fucking insane and is my go to. Thank you for your music and dedication to your fans. You are the voice we have, but can't speak. Tom, you and Nova are changing lives mire than you will ever realize.
Words so true his song are what I listen to when I feel so hopeless 😩 and alone the give me positive energy and keep me motivated
Tears. Literal tears.
This hit close to home for me. Not ashamed to admit it made me cry. My paternal grandfather died from spinal cancer that spread to his brain, My maternal grandparents both died from lung cancer, my maternal great grandfather died of lung cancer, my paternal aunt died from cancer. Both of my parents had it (dad had skin cancer mom had uterine cancer. thankfully both got it caught early and had surgery to remove it) it's so insidious yet this vid is so inspiring as well! Keep on speaking the truth Tom!! you are AWESOME!
My uncle died of Bile Duct Cancer March it crazy fast life can change. This song changed my whole world view on cancer.
Anyone doesn't like this song hasn't gone through any of what mr tom McDonald speaks upon.shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
My reason to write comments like this is to support and not to get likes on my comments.. better like the video song
Everyone who disliked doesn't have humanity
The doctors/researchers know that they could do better but they will never do better bc they want unnoticeable 5$ more every month.. which costs peoples health and lives.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Facts.
Really moved me
Read the book A World without Cancer
I cry every time I listen to this
“Fight it if you have and pray there’s something after it.” I’ve had a brain tumor for 10 years and found this song and I cried because it inspired me to fight my cancer harder
I’m a 13 year old in 2020 and I’m about to cry Lol
I respect Tom so so much all his songs have such good messages
So glad I found your music 🎶
Tom sir you are spot on all the best from UK
Not even a minute in and you got me in tears. I'm a 6 year survivor. Thank you Tom. Thank you for your truthful words, and not backing down from speaking the words people are afraid to.
Powerful stuff man!
Just lost my cousin yesterday to cancer this help me thank u during the tough time you make it easier to make it through the pain
My dad passed away in December 2019 and my grandma passed just 4 days ago from cancer. My mom was diagnosed in 2012 with it as well (she beat it, gets re-tested every 6 months)   It's a terrible thing.   There's still so much I didn't get to learn from my dad. Still so much I wanted to do with him. Damnit man I wish cancer didn't exist.
This song hit me hard
It's a miracle that I am alive today. I encountered HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS (HSV1/2) for four (4) years, six (6) months and twelve (12) days with my calculations, before I met the great Dr. Orukpe. I am from los angeles California, united state of America and I was affected with herpes virus. Herpes is a viral infection caused by the Herpes simplex virus, marked by painful, watery blisters in the skin or mucous membrane or on the genitals. This was what I suffered for four years. I have visited CVS Pharmacy in CA for treatment but no improvement. I met Dr.Orukpe online while I was searching for a herpes cure. I read a testimony about his work. I give a try that now becomes a testimony in my life. I contacted Dr.Orukpe  WhatsApp +2348119310465. or you can  E-mailed , drorukpe43@gmail.com.  https://www.facebook.com/Dr-orukpe-herbal-home-101052358430043/
Cancer is a sickness, created bye greed and lies. The only thing that make cells change, are chemicals and poison. That is something we have learned, when industries made polution after producing items. Wake up people, we are under siege... We need to unite, and fight for our rights.
I went to your free offer that said it wouldn't take my credit card info for money, just for the info and you took money anyway. I am disappointed. Big time. I can't afford the money you took.
Tom is so much more than an artist. This man has messages to get out.
I'm not really a crier but this shit just made me cry
Damn...it takes a lot to make me tear up, yet I’m over here ugly crying
So beautiful
I spent nearly 5 years caring for my mum with terminal cancer, every day, every treatment, always hoping for a cure for her, or another treatment to keep her alive!  May 17th 2020 at 7:55, my mum ended her battle with cancer, and I was by her side as she left this world! ❤️  I miss her so much, and this song brought back all the memories of her, good and bad! ❤️
This made me cry! Its 100% true.
Man Tom you got me on this one, I cried. My pops died from lung cancer, never smoked. Got exposed to plutonium out at Hanford because of Fluor Daniel's mismanagement. What's a man life worth? Not much to a greedy corporation.
Weeds the cure
ESSIAC
I love the passion behind his songs
My dad died from cancer 11 yrs ago ur song is the truth hell bro all ur songs are the truth TomTheTruth
Cancer took my dad 12 years ago. Started out as colon cancer. Given 3 months to live. Lived 12 years. Went into remission. Less than a year after he was cleared, he started getting bad headaches and blurred vision. It had spread to his spine, kidneys, lungs, and brain. I watched this disease turn the best man and human beings I, and many others, ever knew into a hollow shell of a man. He looked like a walking skeleton. It got to where I barely recognized my own father. I remember too many sleepless nights carrying him to the bathroom after his chemo treatments to wash the vomit off of him bc he lost his ability to walk. One night, about 3 days before he passed, I remember going to my vehicle to cry because I didn’t want him to think I was weak or had given up on him. I was going to a local college at the time, and I lied and told him I had to get homework from my vehicle. I remember crying as quietly as I could in the driver seat with the door closed. I got a text from him saying, “don’t cry. It’s okay. I lived 12 years longer than they thought I would. I’m too tired to keep fighting. It’s my time to go and it’s okay.” I still tear up thinking about the amount of strength and bravery that man had. I wouldn’t wish cancer on my worst fucking enemy. Tom MacDonald speaks the truth whether we want to admit it or not. Keep preaching, brother. Don’t let anyone shut you up
I feel this bro! I lost my mom to cancer almost 10 years ago. Watching someone slowly die from cancer is something you dont wish on your enemy.
I lost my wife of 27 years, Kelly Jo Grabman, on September 4,2018 and the pain is still as strong as it was the morning she passed on. She had Pancreatic Cancer which only has a 6% survival rate. Stay strong brother, we'll beat it.
Thank you i a. A survivor for now
LYRICS PLZ
I was diagnosed at 20 of Uteran cancer right after my daughter was born and I fought it til I was 23 and they told me if I didn't let them do a full hysterectomy I was going to die. I was fighting to beat it so I could have another child because my son died at birth when I was 16 and it broke me and I know that was young but my family is riddled with cancer on both sides so my parents told me they would help because of that fact and we had just lost my cousin at age 14 from ovarian cancer. So a week after my 23rd birthday they did a complete hysterectomy and took all of my female parts and 5ft of my large intestines and 2ft of my small intestines, then immediately my body went into full blown Menopause and now I'm 13 days from my 43rd birthday and still going through Menopause!! It's horrible and now it's back but it's Intestinal cancer and I don't know if I can go through chemotherapy and radiation cause the first time I wished I was dead and both my parents passed recently and I don't know if I can go through it without my mom or put my daughter and granddaughter through that!! So I'm battling even telling them cause since my accident she made me live with her and her fiance, which we've never lived apart but I wasn't going to move with her when she got engaged but they both made me. I'm just torn on what to do and I still have to go get the staging done but I'm terrified and my husband is gone now too so my daughter wouldn't have his support this time or all of the family we had then, all the good ones that loved and talked to us that aren't conceited or selfish are dead and gone!! I'm not scared to fight I just don't want to feel like I'm dead before I die and so sick that I can't live life before I loss it!! Great song Tom and video Nova as always, love y'all and God Bless💜🙏😔✌
Lost my mom to ovarian cancer in 08. She was only 50. Thank you Tom this means so much 🙏
I'm here at the gym bawling my eyes out listening to this rightnow. Found out my mom has a high percentage of having breast cancer. I know it's not the same as actually having it yet but she has always been the person I've gone to for emotional strength, and I need to be that person for her now
damn this song is deep. Love it
Tom i appreciate you 🙏
I lost my stepmom 7yrs ago and I still miss her because she went from great to weak in 4mths time.. Then my brother had to battle colon cancer and my mom battled leukemia. My deepest empathy to all who've battled it and still are. God bless you all and may you endure this with the strength of The All Father.
Why would anyone dislike this? I guess some people would rather, I've in blissful ignorance than be faced with hard truths.
Love Tom Macdonald! Just checking the comments to see if anyone else brought up the fact the she "Shaved" a wig off.
Berniecrats rise!!
I'm a savior of childhood cancer! You always have to fight for your life; we only get one chance in this world! I had rabdomiosarcoma and it was inoperable. I have had maximum lifetime dose of radiation to my head and i also had chemo therapy. I saw  9 other kids i grew up with die over the years and I'm  the only one who is still here. I live with survivors guilt which is extremely tough for me because i always question why i am the only one who lived of all these children that I grew up with. I have always fought for everything I have ever wanted and stand up for. This song hits home really hard for me! Thank you Tom McDonald! God Bless everyone in this world and keep on fighting to the end of your days!
I've always said its crazy how literally every American has atleast 1 family member thats had cancer
One of my best friends just passed from stomach cancer 11/8/20 rest in peace Dale thank you for the song it helps
This guy is good
Cancer is too big of a business to cure people That's how healthcare works, they don't want to fix you, they want to medicate you and make money off you for the rest of your (short) life.
3k ppl pressed the wrong button or have no fucking heart......
Tom Macdonald the truth bomber of the year
💖🦋
I worked hospital I meet someone with Hepatitis c and you no what’s crazy they have cure but they still had it more likely he could not afford it the come up with cures for stuff but then you can’t pay for because you poor or no insurance it’s about that money same with cancer
I sent this to my mom...you get the picture.thanks Tom
sat through chemo with my mom and watched cancer take her from us.  this hit hard.  i wish nobody else would ever have to know what that feels like.  much love everyone
My dad passed from cancer this year, this song is the truth prayers for everyone with cancer
Every word this man speaks is the total truth❤💯
My great grandfather died of throat cancer when i was very young... He couldnt eat anything solid at first, soon after he could barely drink water. You know the sad thing... the only memory i have of him was me giving him a hug when he was laying in his bed. Nothing more than just skin and bones. He was around 60ish, and i imagine couldnt of weighed more that 60-70lb. 60 years... and i cant tell you more than he died of cancer... I guess at least i got to meet him before he went. I hope they are treating you well up there.
They have the cure i have no doubt that they do
They damn sure figured that covid vaccine out fast af tho but no one ready for that convo
I'm a bit disappointed that the song No Lives Matter got more attention than this masterpiece
Holy shit Tom. This hit the feels. My wife is a cancer survivor. I have no other words. Just, Thank you.
My mother is dying of cancer right now as i type this. Fuck this disease. Tom  McDonald it may not mean alot to you but this song is helping me deal with this. Thank you
Hope my dad is finally resting easy. Meet ya someday
I thought you wrote a song about your music career but I guess not
My family has a gene where almost all of us die from cancer my 8 year old cousin had throat cancer she had a surgery and she has a huge scar I haven’t seen her in years but I’m hoping she’s ok and I am getting tested to see if I have the stand of dna 🧬 for the cancer we’re hoping for the best we can’t afford  for that to happen most of my family had cancer so I get this
This hits home so hard!  I have pancreatic cancer and a single dad, I agree with this song and congrats with no lives matter.  Another great song.  I think you the most underrated artist! Sparking so much in everyone.  A spark is all that is needed to burn down the systems
Aids -ErrorAV Siege God
My mom died of breast cancer. She was the only one who really believed that i could be someone important. She was sick for 8 months,  I saw her grow weaker day after day. It breaks my heart because i was the only one who was really there for her and I'm sixteen so i couldn't douch for her before she passed. She passed away about two weaks ago. The last thing she did was giving a kind and loving look right before she took her last breath. She was my everything.
All results in mum has lung cancer first week treatment shrunk mess in good lung we now have more time with her. Thankyou so much for your song going to play it to her tomorrow.im finding strength knowing #hangovergang got my back love you all here in uk xxxx
Your lyrically amazing bro. Facts
My best friends just passed this weekend from lymphoma, This is the first time hearing this song today.  Hits home hardcore. Keep up the good work Tom
I’m crying watching this my grandma who I was more close with than my whole family had cancer for years and I as a 5-10 year old had to watcher her go through this I seen her the day before she passed I bawled my eyes out my dad told me that night that I needed to spend the night with someone and turns out the next day he told me she passed the day I seen her that’s why I had to spend the night with someone I loved her she was the closest person to me in my family I had to sit on her hospital bed every day in order to talk to her she refused to stay at the hospital so we had a hospital bed with her treatments at her house she was also living with an abusing boyfriend but she had no way to leave and my dad couldn’t do a. Thing bc it wasn’t his house crying writing  this I’m 12 now pls pray for me and my family it’s still hard for us
This shit means a lot to a survivor, love you big homie
May the full armor of God surround you sir, for telling the cold hard facts about cancer!! This conspiracy theorist has your back!This isn't a conspiracy theory, this is conspiracy TRUTH!!!!!
I will always cry at the mother laying with her daughter. A parents worst fear is losing their child. I couldn’t even imagine living longer than my child
♥️♥️♥️
It sucks, but biology is hard. I'm sorry your healthcare system takes advantage of you :(
My mum has cancer, she’s in remission but it never really goes away, just like a volcano, it lays dormant, she’s the strongest woman I’ve ever known and I’m blessed to be raised by her, I may not be everyone’s example of what good parenting can produce but I’m thankful she taught me the difference between right and wrong and how to respect others, I hope everyone who has a family member that’s going through this right now knows that, you carry that weight because you’re built for carrying it, god never gives you more than he knows you can carry, at times it can seem unfair and even feel like a punishment but he has faith in you, he knows no matter how much you’re going through you’ll get through it and he’s always right there behind you, god bless you all.
Omg made me cry had breast cancer almost died from the treatment spot on Tom and thanks Nova unbelievable
This hit home for me I grew up with a cousin that was diagnosed at four years old with leukemia. She beat it and she still a live. It was so thought seeing her so sick I’m just glad she was able to beat it
I lost my dad not to cancer but cause he couldn't handle the pain of cancer. My dad had cancer for a couple of years and he tried so much to get better but it didnt help so the pain got worse and he decided to take his own life he overdosed on pills. The very next day my mom was laying next to him and she woke up only to find him passed away and then she woke up my oldest brother and then all of my other brothers and sisters. My oldest brother was so mad that he started to put his fist through walls and he was really angry and the rest of my family started to cry bad and wouldn't stop but it didnt hit me until after I started to cry like crazy. The werid thing is that was the only time I seen my oldest brother cry. I'm not looking for sympathy or anything like that I just want everyone to know your not the only one who's had this probably and your gonna get through it and i hope who ever has cancer I pray🙏 that you get better and may God watch over you and protect you. I love 💚❤💛💜💙🧡and miss you dad R.I.P
Beautiful brother- i love you!! keep up the wonderful work!!!! You have a huge platform that will only get bigger my friend.  Perfect dive ZERO SPLASH 10.000 OLYMPIC'S SON!!!!
Very well done!
So many cancer cases this damn year.  Unfortunately someone close to me too.  I've done months of none stop research to get her the best research proven stuff to beat it. After two rounds of Chemo her energy levels are good abd her pain is almost gone. Doctors  saying her recovery is good so far. Long way to go. You nailed it with this one man. God bless.
Oml my grandma has cancer so this hits hard
#keviestrong

Damm this is strong and powerful im glad you a song like this my guy
1974 Cannabis study. Found the cure for cancer in mice
Amen, God's working through this man, and God is  limitless!   Chemo kills!  Let me talk in code here:    One time a man saw fungus/mold, oops, I mean cancer.  He USED TO love eating foods with yeast, sugar, and carbs but after the diagnosis he threw all that in the trash along with his cancer.  Is Jim humble? Well he isn't poison, believe that!  Who is Jim Humble and why does the FDA hate cures but love poison...   Your welcome
I survived! Thank you Tom!!
Didn't think I was gonna cry lol but I did.  I have stage 4, so far I'm kicking its ass. Keep fighting everyone!! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️  Prayers!!
Tom, there is no cure for cancer. Also, there are many different types of cancers and not all respond to chemo or radiation. The expense of healthcare is so high for a couple of different reasons.  Will start with pharmaceuticals, for every drug manufacturer gets through the FDA process it has to how do you expense of around 20 that don’t pass. Once a drug makes it to market has the patent life is over. This is why you will see an extended release formula, re-formulations restart the clock. surgeries, hospital visits, ICU are very expensive because we have reached a point where the law of diminishing returns is occurring. The flap of a curve is a difficult place to be. people whom take medications seriously need to consider the risks of the treatment, or pass on it. We will be entering a time of personal responsibility as legal fees for AE, SAE, and Endpoints. Healthcare in this country is treated as an undifferentiated commodity when it really shouldn’t. and of course insurance companies and health insurance companies make a profit off of that as well. Oh yeah last US government sets the prices for all treatments in this country, in the form of CPT codes. Generally hospitals are required to take these patients and reimbursement Only meets marginal costs. Which is why there are three different rates for individuals, what your healthcare company will pay, Medicare Medicaid, selfpay. Unfortunately those whom pay cash receive largest bills.   We’re it  not for this pandemic I would be completing my PhD in healthcare policy. I also have a plan in order to cut the cost of healthcare by 14% nationwide without changing anything but one line and one law.  End of dissertation. :-) HOG
The night's are so long....
I’ve lost my grandfather and Aunt to cancer.  It’s an evil serial killer! 😭
I just lost my grandfather to cancer this made me believe he is still here
Thank you for making this song..
I found out my father has stage three Cancer. This song made me cry. It's hard seeing the man that's always been your strong hero feel sad an weak.
My prayer is we see the day very soon where nobody suffers and nobody loses family members to cancer.
Wow. Thank you for this.
So true love this
Brain tumor, did you know when its bad enough they put it on a cancer bomb spree? radiation, chemo, pain, neuropathy, its a rough ride, I am slowly coming out of it!  Thank you Tom, the feels were felt with your video and lyrics.  now to get back at least some of that 60lbs my skinny ass lost.
This dude really cant make a bad song....
To anyone here who is unsure: There IS SOMEWHERE AFTER THIS, it has nothing to do with good or bad, only the blood of Jesus. Jesus gave us a way if you will take it.
BEAUTIFUL 🌹
Wow. Just wow... Thank you.
U r really a great man by heart buddy! May God give  u everything in LYF. Stay blessed.
Choked up
F the world bruh u the fucking goat
I lost my grandmother to cancer 8 years ago. I just lost my dog the other day of cancer. I pray you all find the strength to cary on, to fight through it. Have a wonderful day :)
The beauty of an Earth Angel is they don't even realize what they are
3 * and Counting wow 10 years of pain.... Pulled out in 10 mins KEEP IT UP BRUH YOU'RE HEALING US INSIDE ❤
Oh my God bro I need a towel not a tissue ❤
Very touching expression of Truth. Thank you for putting out such an inspirational song about such a worldwide issue.
This song reminda me of my dads life in 2005 like 4 of our very close family members died it was a horrid year
I love it. They have a cure, but only for the elite. Population control. I lost my brother and father to cancer. But I know where they are now.😊💗✝️ You are wrong about one thing though, some of us don't want to stay here on Earth. We know what is waiting for those who believe in Jesus.
I've been screaming about Cannabis treatments for years... there is a LOT of science out there at this point, and honestly has been for a long time. It doesn't work on all types of cancers, but it is extremely effective on some (and I'm talking about cannabinoids KILLING CANCER CELLS, not just treating nausea from chemotherapy). If you are suffering and have not yet researched cannabis as a possible medicine, PLEASE DO. There is no excuse for the medical industry not to be promoting it other than profit margins and the lack of patents on cannabinoids (Goddess forbid that ever happens). Look into it if you haven't. Depending on the type cancer, it could be beneficial to your recovery🙏💜💙💚🧡💛🙏
Tom, I want to thank you for this. I lost my grandpa two years ago. My niece  will know him. I sent this song to my father who is over seas. I thank you so much.
The feeling and power behind this song, straight masterpiece.
YES🙌🙌🙌🙌
❤❤❤❤❤
I love this song but is Noone gonna talk about the unrealistic bald cap
Just❤
This guy just got a new fan 💯 I grow cbd for this reason.... this plant had the cure for everything including cancer
I cried
I found that 3 days after my grand mother passed from cancer, I teared up. Thank you for this song.
Bro... thank you so much for this. Brought tears, someone very close to me passed from breast cancer a couple years ago after beating it on 3 separate occasions but when it came back the 4th time it was with a vengeance. You're a voice for those who are too afraid to address sensitive topics and too afraid to vary from the norm and step up to speak out. Your a beast homie
This song is amazing Tom just amazing💯💯
Love this song hits home
I'm dying of cancer...
🔥🔥🔥
FACTS! Hmm but yet they just found the cure for the super flu C O V I D ?? What a joke! Too many puppets out there being sheep. More need to wake up to the truth.
♡♡♡
Thanks Tom keep up the good work 👍.
This song is soo underrated!  Thank you Tom Macdonald your amazing 💯
The song Just reminds me about my dad Keep the good work
This one hit home
Breast Cancer Survivor/fighter! I thank you! This hits home every time! And I Love You for that! So keep spitting the truth! Remember you touched so many with this song including Me! 💕
💔💔💔💔💔
there is so much pain with this sickness but if you want the truth red john 3:16
Thank you Tom 🙏
We have been running for the cure and wearing ribbons for ages, why are people still going trough radiation.... 100 bilion dollar industry, they can't afford to end it, no body want's to die, our only option is to spend it.   Agree half we only think we are out of options when we spent all of them.  When time catches up on us. But are we really afraid to die?  Don't give up what? Your right to speak, your right to make choices, the food you ingest?  Dieing is going to catch up on all of us, better ask the next question,  Why do we let them keep profiting from our suffering?
<3
Tom! Thank you for you being very talented with your lyrics. I'm surprised you were allowed to post this, Considering the truth behind it.   I've watched someone decay from this slowly. Never prepared for it.   Im certain I cannot watch this video for a while man..Damn!   Great delivery!
Thank u this touch me my mom died of cancer thanks tom it help
My best friend is struggling with chemo and radiation. Burkett's lymphoma after a kidney transplant, which has spread to her brain. This song choked me up...
This song hit me. My dad was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2000 fought it till he passed in 2013. Thank you for making this song Tom. Also to anyone who is currently battling this disease or knows someone who has it I may not know you, but you're in my prayers. Just know you're not alone.
Lost my Mother to it when she was 58 years old. Hardest thing is, her grandbabies will never know her.
these  "Cancer Awareness" months arent actually to help fight cancer. notice how they use the word awareness instead of cure or prevention? their intention is  to subliminally tell us that youre probably going to die from cancer one day, and you should accept it.
me my brother and my dad love this song thx for makeing it man im new to your music but well thx i agree with all you say
Nothing but truth here and still we the people are big pharma pawns.
Real!
They do have a cure they just want more people to die because our government is just bad
My mom passed away almost 8 years ago from lung cancer, I've seen what it does to people and I hate it
If this was dropped in the 2000s this would’ve blown up
My dad died from cancer
After becoming a man from growing as a lil boy  I’ve only cried 5 times when my grandma died the day I married the love of my life the birth of my daughter and son and this song (lost a lot of family members to cancer)
My husband listens to your music, and I hear it by proxy, but this song, this song just hit me so hard. My 5 year old beat a 17% survival rate and the bridge of this song feels like you wrote it for me and my family. No one wants to tell the truth or hear the truth about cancer, and you tell it. It's awful and you just tell it like it is and how it is. If you're fighting, never give up. You got this and we got you. You can do this.
Tom is one of the only ones using his music to actually make a difference
Cancer is probably one of those things we can never truly eradicate its a really unique thing its your own cells replicating mistakes which is insane
Marijuana is the cure they don't want...
Are there just about 3, 000 people subscribed to Tom McDonald just so they can dislike every video???????
My Son has been in remission for 9 years from Medulablastoma with a 17% 1-year survival rate. I absolutely love this song and to all fighting, this fight give it all you have don't go quietly into the night.
I just showed my co worker this video and he said " This man im impressed he is going to change the world. He says things that matter"
This song had a good point on many things
This hits home so hard... I've had alot of family members in the pass few years die do to cancer. Thank you Tom for this song helps me remember them and that they fought as hard and as long as they could.   Much love and respect for you Tom, you really understand your fans and shit people go through!!!
This is heartbreaking.. And the horrible infuriating part is that theyve had cures for cancers for decades. You can destroy cancer cells with sound frequencies, Making your body alkaline because cancer cant survive unless youre body is acidic, etc.. These things have been known for years.. But they just keep selling people hope and poison because its all about the money.. If a million people need to die for big pharma to get even more disgustingly rich, Then were all dying. This isnt what this country was supposed to be.
You are very wise Tom.
Opened my eyes to this possible ruse
I cried when I heard this because my mom,grandpa and grandma were fighters till the end. Love this song brother. Stay strong America
Tom KNOW there IS something AFTER THIS!! BY HIS STRIPES WE ARE HEALED! ISAIAH 53:5
😭😭❤️❤️
Man, My grandma had cancer she beat it but it had its toll. She had lung cancer and has half a lung, This song just is beautiful! Tom you inspire me to a better person every time I listen to your music Thank you and To anyone that is fighting cancer you got this
I wish this song didn't come on while I was driving it made me cry beautiful song
my uncle beat cancer 3 times got to stage five the had to restart a year ago
I never thought about something he said look how much money that has been raised say in the past 30 years.
My dad died from cancer
Damn Tom. 👍🏻
Doctors are curing cancer!!’ Infusio.org
Tom you are a such a incredible soul
My mother fought breast cancer, I myself am slowly dying from cystic fibrosis. Your music has helped me get through more than I can express. Thank you for being one of the few real ones left, keep speaking the truth and spreading your message. You're a fighter, may God bless you. ✌
W
Thank you tom for this song my dad died of cancer back in 2011 I have had a hard time trying to keep living my life like he would want me to so thank you for all your music, songs like this make it a little less painful to think about.
Because cancer isn't just one disease
That’s deep in the hart it hits keep it up bro love it from down under in Australia
Lost my aunt not to long ago from cancer and I’ve heard of his music before slept on it but damn
You're Brave.
You're literally saving lives out here. Mentally. 👌
This song really hits home brother. My mother passed away 7 years ago started with lung cancer then it went to her brain but she kept fighting, finally we all told her to just let go, so she didn’t have to keep fighting a losing battle
SUPER NEW FAN HERE MADU. I'M ALMOST 58 YEARS OLD AND HAVE BEEN AROUND THE RAP GAME FROM THE BOOGIE DOWN BRONX.  YOU'RE STYLE IS DIC MADU.
It's crazy when u hit a heart string...too see where numbness leads u...cancer is one of the worst things too die from but the companies we eat from and live OUR normal lives...the companies we buy are medication doesn't want a cure....they want patients....they don't want a cure.. the HINT I see in this song...is that there is a cure but NORMAL PPL LIKE ME, U AND OUR FAMILIES DONT LIVE UP TOO THE STANDARD OF GETTING THE "CURE".. it's a hard hitting fact when me as a normal human/ american is a pawn it hurt too an end that I thought that wouldn't end.  ...but I too is a pawn that means nothing too a "grand scheme"..pick "ur president" it means nothing long term....we are numbers... Hopefully ur social security number means something
Am I the only one who just noticed this video didn’t have adds on it I think it’s really nice he isn’t trying to profit off of a cancer story
How does an amazing song like this have only 100k likes and a shit song like WAP is topping charts
Great song 😥❤️. I became a holistic health coach because I understood through my own health struggle that western medicine mainly treats the symptoms of the illness, not the cause.
I Love You Alex Trebek
Why dislike his videos, Tom MacDonald  is telling  the  through with  music
TRUE.....illnesses stink thats for sure....all of you that are IN good health KISS THE SKY
This dude is so legit, deserves so much more respect than what he gets.
I must add that if you have a child that is a minor with cancer.  You, THE PARENTS have NO CHOICE!  Those "treatments" will happen or they will take your child and put him or her into STATE CUSTODY!!
You are a vessel of real music💪🏾
I’m not a person who enjoys rap but this a man with a message... this is what music is about.
This was beautiful thank you so much for this!
My mom just recently died to cancer. Cancer sucks!!
Cancer treatment should be free.. Its not the victim's fault most of the time.
Thank you so much for this beautiful song🥰 I have been fighting breast cancer for almost two years. The radiation caused cancer to grow in my spinal cord and spine itself. Blew out two vertebrae’s and I am now fighting cancer with herbs rather than chemotherapy and radiation.  This song made me cry, but in the same time it makes me feel so proud of my Mike stones and what I have gone through and survived❣️❣️  Thank you for this song, I’m downloading it as my fighting song❣️🥰🦋 Because I will survive this cancer ❣️❣️
THIS🙌 GOES RIGHT ALONG WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES. I SPEND MORE THAN HALF MY INCOME IF I DONT HAVE INSURANCE BECAUSE I HAVE ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS
This hit me hard my mom died when I was 9 to a rare cancer called ovarian cancer she couldn’t catch in time so she died. The last day I saw her still haunts me. Thanks Tom you made a little easier for me.
Wow. Very touching man
This dude make me cry bro
A.L.L. Remission Prayers and love for all those still fighting.
I've been a fan of yours since the beginning, but I love you for this song ❤️ after watching my grandmother wither away from cancer this hits home. Thank you
Whoever hates this song is stupid. I think this song will help a lot of people. Good song Tom keep it up I love this song. I just found out that my mom got breast cancer
Thank you for this i lost my mom last year to cancer
Good dude. Your music is very rich and meaningful. Definitely keep on shinning.
8 years old, July 23rd, 2015. My father passed away due to cancer in the middle and back portions of his brain, which had spread to his spinal column, arms, legs, lungs, kidneys. He fought cancer for roughly 7 years. He never abused us, or attempted to mentally torment us by yelling. The doctors gave him an estimated 6 months to a year. He died 18 hours after that estimation. Not even a day.. we learned later after research was released that Chemo and Radiation would've nearly gotten rid of the cancer. The doctors said it wasn't an option when it was first discovered. He went into numerous surgeries, they took chunks out, and it kept spreading. Not once did he give up. Wheelchair bound, and forced to eat through a tube directly into his stomach, he continued to love and nurture his children with experiences and a father. I now type this at 14 years old, no father, and basically no mother. She resulted to drugs and men to get over her depression, telling us, her kids, that she'd only be happy once we were gone.   If you took the time to read this, I thank you. Have a wonderful rest of your day.
You are an inspiration ..... You'll save this World

Keep rappin bout real shitt man I LOVE IT
My grandma passed from cancer in 2011 from lung cancer. My mom died 5 years later after battling for a year and half. Now my aunt is battling right now, just had surgery on  10/29/20  I'm 30 years old but through these tragedies I learned the best medicine is a smile. Chemo sucks and surgery is tough and the family members can feel helpless as these things go on. The best thing you can do is smile, be brave, and do everything you can to help your loved ones. Don't be afraid if you are going through this. Show them your inner strength and if you are the one battling, keep smiling and never give up.
Xoxox much love xoxox
Thank you Tom. This one hits home.
Outstanding Tom - as always.
😔 RIP Dad.
How does this have 3k dislikes. Even if you dislike Tom, how are you gonna dislike a message about hating cancer and giving people hope who do have it.
This hit home so hard
Damn the world is burning itself down...  And some dude named  Tom Macdonald is actually saying things that actually matter.  Who's Tom??? Fuck if I knew a few month ago but hes from my homeland and hes actually doing waaaaaaay more in music with the positive side of this shit dark world we're trapped in with these horrible elites and criminals politicians.
You’re one amazing guy. I’ve been trying to tell people the same thing for years. Cure? Cancer can’t live in an alkaline environment of about 7.3 ph. Eliminate garbage processed foods, at least until you get better. Detox, nourish with phytos, vitamins, juicing and do your own research.  Truth About Cancer with Ty and Charlene Bollinger can also help those affected.
All this guy does is beg on ig story for follows and likes LAME and him and his gf never bathe they stank
I am glad you say the truth.
I'm so mad that I found you music right when you blew up first song I heard was whiteboy. You are fucking awesome man I love all your songs. Keep speaking the truth
Thank you man you are influential keep making your music man it has helped me alot
This video hits on why we should all be getting universal healthcare. Tom hit it hard when the bills started building up and others have commented that due to lack of healthcare coverage the could not get the necessary treatment to save thier lives.  It's 2020 as I write this. The fact that so many people are against everyone having a fighting chance to live amazes me. Why should so many people suffer for corporations and the pharma companies to make do much money from others death and suffering. Hopefully our new president will make some great changes for everyones benefit.
Great song Tom Macdonald you tell the truth on Cancer. This health matter runs in my mother side of the family. One cousin passaway years ago due to ovary cancer, and then her sister breast removal thank God alive.  Cancer is serious so stay safe and God bless those who have it stay strong, positive, blessings and those that don't try to prevent it check your health is important.  Mr. Macdonald you are awesome, your  wonderful voice keep singing. 😘😘😘🙏
From the song "Hang on" to this..... Tom your rockin bro. I cant believe i doubted you at the beginning to be like the other ones. Keep up being you. We need more you around here. Teach us all to be our selves, to bring the stress down and to love more. I love you and all your fans.
Please set up an account on rumble and Parler so we can continue to support you
You got me crying tonight, Tom.
if the cancer doesn't kill them, the chemo will. Maybe we should start leaving the system, go back to nature. Live a nomadic life. Anything's better than being a slave in a system that thrives from our pain.
Never heard of you at all and then this pops on my feed and has me in tears. Inspirational music, sir.
Thank you Tom! The messages you express in your music touches many
Kinda ironic the thing they didn't want us to have is the cure, marijuana!
Aug 24 I got a positive stage3 cancer. .... Thanks for this🖤🖤🖤
Thank you for this song! Means more then you know!!! #fuckcancer #currentcancerpatient #dontgiveup
lost my dad tocancer, thank you for this Tom, tells the world how i feel. the fight is real!
My father had Leukemia.  The insurance company refused to pay for the treatment that the doctors said was his best chance.  He said ok he'd pay for it, then they said they would refuse to cover absolutely anything after that because they claimed it would become a "pre-existing condition" (before the law was changed).  They basically forced him to choose going broke and leaving my mom with nothing, or to go with the treatment they wanted which was the standard bone marrow transplant.  He ended up not making it.
The only good thing about cancer is it gives you time to correct all the wrongs and say good bye just in case  But the roller coaster deeply scars those that love you,  I know without any doubt after we take our last breath, We live on, But I cannot answer for certainty  if heaven or hell is the destination, Anyone that has had a near death experience will tell you  We live on
2020 Election Fraud https://youtu.be/jZzSttpgAlM
Blessings to everyone Out there who goes through Cancer or has a Family Member/Friend with Cancer. I hope for y'all one day you can laugh together again and experience a great Life♥️
:'(
All those facing this devil called cancer, know you are not alone! Jesus can move mountains! Call for his name and he will answer! You are loved and we will beat this disease🙌🏼🇺🇸
Please research B17 and watch " a world without cancer" on YouTube it can save lives❤❤😇
I hate you tom, making me ball my eyes out!! Lol  For real though, this song hit me hard, my mom passed from cancer when I was 17, left me and my 1 yr old brother. Thank u for this song ❤❤
Damn this broke me. My son battled Osteosarcoma, bone cancer, 2 years ago. They gave him a 20% or less chance to survive. Watched him nearly die twice in the hospital and go through all the pain, and just looking so sick from those evil drugs they give. They removed the tumor, it was in his face under his right eye. He lost his eye completely, they took it out, 1/3 of his front skull, filled the surgery area from tissue in his stomach. That failed. Then took from his leg, had complications and loss all feeling of his right leg from the knee down. They weren't sure if he would walk again on that leg. Today, he can walk, drive, and thank God alive. But today he suffers from PTSD, severe depression, and wishes he died at the hospital ☹ I thank and give glory to God he's alive, I would trade my life to take all he went through and is suffering through today. Now he is 18, 15 & 16 when he went through it all, hasn't been to school since and had to drop out. He's was a true warrior through it, and he knows where he'll go if he dies because of his faith and belief in Jesus.
"We're dying to keep living" that hit me hard!
Man I've been waiting for someone to come out with music that actually matters to people and that people can relate to. I'm glad I came across your music. There's not one song that I've heard that I didn't like and that didn't speak the truth. I honestly hope you keep making music for years upon years to come. Your music has spoken to peoples hearts. I'm looking forward to more music from you. Thanks for your hard work and dedication to make positive music and vibes. Hopefully the young kids this generation can hear your music instead of this bullshit that's playing now days. Thank you and God bless you and your wife.
Thanks for this!!! 11 yrs since my mum died still hurts (sometimes worse) every day, when she was your best friend as well as ya mum.
This is the 1st song you've done that brought tears to my eyes... THANK-YOU tom and Nova, this will help so many people in so many ways. Thank-You
Tom man you have a spot in my heart man. If I ever start a church. I wish I could have you perform there man. God bless you man
🙌🖤🙌 Just for those not woke enough to know....this song is not only about actual cancer and a much more beautiful and brilliant meaning 🙌🖤🙌
I decided years ago, if I ever got Cancer, I'd have surgery to remove it, but will NOT have chemo... I'd rather spend 1 month living, than 3 years dying.
Tom hope ur mom feels better love u man
My sister who has gone through cancer and all the problems "the cure" of radiation left her with; triple heart valve replacement, copd, lesions and adhesions on every organ, stroke, so much damage to uterus she needed a hysterectomy. Always gets so annoyed when people tell her what a fighter she is like as if she has a choice. What's the other option, giving up? Suicide? You can't roll over and do nothing or you've died before the cancer even started. She's strong for putting up with all the bullshit that goes along with "the cure".
You always speak the truth keep it up 💖
Thank you bro! Cancer is on my family.. my dad...
This song really touched my heart😔🥺☺️❤️
Beautiful
Tom thats so real thanks for this you will touch alot of people with this blessing!🙏🏻🙏🏻
WOW
I lost my mom to cancer.  I personally thank you Tom thank you for this video  . I needed it .
Shit make me cry damn
This hit me so hard man😭 I lost my grandmother this year due to colon cancer, that woman helped raised me I lost so much the day she passed away😔😔😔
Cancer is horrible, but treatments actually have gotten better. 20 years ago my mom lost her hair went through radiation, all of it. Now she’s good. My dad has cancer now and had a different cancer a year ago. Neither have required chemo, radiation or extended hospital stays.   Progress is slow, but it’s happening. Get checked early and often!
Beautiful song❤️
Today is the first time i heard of you.. NO LIVES MATTERS.. this is your best video.. Give it to St. Jude..
Damn I guess songs from YouTube ads can be fire as fuck and music with meaning still exists with hope
😥
This one hit me hard bro. Lost mom 4 years ago, dad on the 3rd of Sept. 2020. treatments always get them. No one dies from their initial cancer. And do you know the cure has been hidden from us for years. Hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin..... Trump go gave us that for a reason  bro. Cancer is a parasitic disease.
Just found out a week ago my 91 year old grandma has breast cancer AGAIN. In the same breast she had it in over 30 years ago. Due to her age, she is limited with what things she can do to get rid of it. Please pray for my grandma to beat this, again!
Thanks for this song Tom lost my older sister to Leukemia back in 2002 not gonna lie I cried just hearing this song man I believe they’ve always had a cure but like you said in the video they would loose to much money if they gave the cure to everyone
There are entire towns with different cancers poisoned by close contact facilities like Georgia Power, Duke Energy, ect.
No one wants to go, until you have your only family waiting on you
Lost my dad to cancer 12 years ago. I hate cancer and had to watch my dad dieting from this and I NEVER want to watch another loved one die that horrible death. RIP DAD I MISS you every day.
Thank God the younger generation are finally seeing it for what it is. I have not heard that one yet. Were paying them to kill us. That’s a good one I’ve been saying we’re killing ourselves slowly. I know this may seem impossible to believe but I believe we will make it through this, as long as we know what’s really happening whose who and aware of their actions, because it can no longer be hidden, the worst anyone can do is give up.  We will make it through this, if God brought it to us, than God will take us through it. We were given this life because we are strong enough to actually LIVE IT
My mom have mom cancer🥺😖☹🤧
This Song Gave Me The Chills. The Emotions Coming Out Are So Warm
My dad has been fighting for his life for a year. This is his second battle with cancer. He is losing  that fight. Now I'm in tears. Damn this sucks.
🙏❤️
Most meaningful song of 2020
No shit man. This is large hadron collider type of music is has that much power. Thanks Tom you are the future!
lovley song just cant lissen to it. to painfull
love you grandad***
You remind me of bert from the used.
Tysm for this! I am a Cancer Survivor! Almost a yr and a half in remission! Tom you are incredible! You speak more truth then I have ever heard! God bless you & anyone who is fighting anything or has lost the fight!
The Plant Paradox
I feel like Tom put so much into this song, but its so underated 😔😔
HOG for life, great tune Tom.....
I love this guys so much he sings the truth about everything. He gets what’s going on and everyone should listen.
I love you who ever you are?
Does Tom not sell digital music? I want to support and buy his new albums but I don't even have cd players anymore.
This is a good duo tom and nova, this is reality the subjects he raps about.  Tom should link up with public enemy, there on the same page
if you can't feel this song then you are already dead.......
DUUUDE!! THIs is the kind of music I was hoping you'd get back to making! Amazing dude!
This going to help so many people you have no idea music has such an inspiration in peoples lives 💙🙏
My sister has cancer & I cry all the time for her. Idk what I'd do if I lost her :( 💜
💛💛💛
Dawg y the fam white nd the doctor they getting mad at black?
We found 3k people who work for big pharma.
That hit home. Amazing song
Bro watching the mom crawl into the bed 😭😭😭😭💯brought a tear to my eye. Ive never known anyone who had cancer or have had cancer myself but damn tom good job bro.
Brought tears to my eyes man. 😢
My mother was diagnosed with both a minor lung cancer(pea sized tumor removed) and metastatic breast cancer and can't afford the treatments anymore and I'm not in a position to help unless I go homeless. I feel this song, wholeheartedly agree, but recognize the corporately funded politicians and big pharma have no incentive to push for release of the cure as treatment is more profitable.
Good music , but With 7.8 Billion and rising , gotta get a little creative on helping Death out some.
Powerful stuff Tom.  Please don't ever stop doin your thing man.  It's because of you that I didn't give up completely on rap music.
This man will be like a chapter in the bible
this shit broke my heart
Beautiful and heartbreakingly true😢
This gave me chills
Thanks for making me cry. Lol love the song.
That was a touching song tom. That soung touched my heart. I loved it. I belive youll touch many hearts out here and people will really start to realize what you are saying and  bc all your songs are truth there is no fake.  Much love to H.O.G Tom Macdonald goooo!!!🤘🏽🤘🏽🤘🏽
This hits hard
What a great artist.......so much better than the mainstream rapper bullshit
This song hit home for me so much........
My fellow patriots...you already know a Biden win is coming. Let's just hang in there, protect our own, and be strong! ✊🏽🇺🇲 This is a dope track, I just wanted to share my message.
https://youtu.be/tIo5wVQZlH8

This is gonna make me cry my mom finished chemo last summer after having a relapse of cancer and thank God her scans are clear now. I don’t know what I would do without her because she’s my best friend. Cancer really does suck I worry all the time if I have the gene, but I don’t wanna live my life in fear knowing I have it either.
Tom Macdonald must expose hollywood and pizzagate next.
This song is everything. Thank you for being such a badass .. willing to get the honest narrative out there 👊🏼
Gratitude, my dad stage 4 Prostate Cancer! He may be 86 but he is the only family I have left, my mother passed in 2013, of Conjestive Heart failure! I'm a only child! My husband I'm SEPERATED from because I want to be loved, not abused! And my Son don't give 2 shits about me! Cause He is to busy living his dream! I love him anyway! Love&Light and healing and one day we will come To understanding of inlightment We all have the power within to heal thy selfs! Because we are more than our bodies and circumstances
😅
Damn good song Tom. Thank you.
I lost my mother to cancer on 10/24/20. This hit deep
Thank you for this song my father passed away from cancer may God bless you!
Gave me chills and tears cause I lost my grandpa from cancer
death isnt the worst thing in the world, the fear is
THANK YOU!!!!!! I NEEDED THIS REMINDER TODAY!!! I WILL CONTINUE MY FIGHT!!!!!!!!
my mum is fighting cancer (for the second time in 12 months) and i cant see her rn cause of covid and lockdown. Thank you for making this song, I think I will show it to her.
stage 4 cancer , starting radiation this monday. this track just made me cry. i appreciate you for making it , means more than you'd know.
IMPORTANT Anyone with or suffering from Cancer, Please research ROYAL RIFE, Alkaline diets including lots of lemons and broccoli, Also QUININE, it can HELP! This has been known and covered up and discredited by pharma for decades to keep you sick or kill you, to keep the money rolling in.
This song really touched my heart. Thank you Tom! Much love and respect.
Relapsed in July 2019, still on chemo. This is so true.
Your music helps so many people through there hardest times in life alot of people no me personally and lately been dealing with alot but whenever I'm around friends they play your music for me to make me smile which I haven't been doing lately but when your music come on  it always always turns my frown upside down and brightens my day keep being you because many follow you because your different then the rest you speak what's on your mind without hesitation
Oh shit, got me with this one.
My mother has cancer if I type anymore I'll break.
2.5k people felt emotions they didn't know they had and didn't know what to do but put a thumbs down. Keep it up Tom, BTW thats a good name.
Thank you and Semper Fi!!! Edit This was the song that led me to your music! I am living with emphysema and this song is very personal! #CanswerAnswers  Semper Fi
Toms on a whole another level, appreciate this ma dude
This right here transcend's all genres of music
Tom, Thank you for this. My father in law is stage 4.  I've always been able to bury my emotions, haven't cried since i was a child and this song broke me. The line where you say "Your mom, your dad and sister inside a room and someone won't survive it, do you hope it isn't you? " To be completely honest, if I thought it would save someone I love and care about, I'd take that burden from them
I am actually a survivor of testicular cancer, and I love this song and it is a very powerful message. I was blessed to have a very short battle with cancer unlike many others, I have seen many people die of cancer and it’s honestly so hard to see. These are the types of songs that will bring our world one step closer to unity. I hope everyone who will ever go through cancer will stay strong and be happy. It is very difficult when you are first told you have cancer, it’s tough but in my experience I found it much easier to be sad then happy and found that when I was happy regardless of my situation, I was striving and I hope everyone can learn to this, not just with cancer but with their lives
This song makes me cry
The cancer is the chemicals in our food our food has chemicals because its artificial our food is artificial because natural is becoming scarce and natural food is scarce because there's to many mouths to feed. We are overpopulated
Those 2.9k people who disliked obviously never went through family member(s) who have/ had cancer. I've had 8 family members with diff types of cancer and only 2 survived. I miss the other 6 everyday. Thank you Tom
It's 10 bro wares the new song
We don't know where we go, but I  got a   general idea. Every   life is different, and I think  Tom maybe    a being    I promoted so I  didn't have   to come back  to this shit pit....   God pleas let me die......
My mum or mom died of cancer😢
Hell yeah
Thank you for an amazing song Tom. Everyday on my way home from work I listen to it and everytime I shed a tear for everyone going through the battle. Stay strong everyone, you got this, you ARE a fighter and you ARE strong. You have my endless respect
In the fight right now man. Thank you for this
my mom suffers from breast cancer and i’m always wondering whether she’s gonna survive, listening to this definitely made me cry but gave me a little more hope..thank you tom
can you do something with CORPSE plz lol...
Whoever disliked this needs to eat some logic gummies
I feel this... It's sad but we are fighting and I know how hard it is my brother died from it he was 8 mouths old and I was not born but it touches everyone so keep fighting
Thank you.
Only real music lover, can understand this kind of music.. Motivational, inspirational. God bless Tom💪❤❤❤🙏
This song hits home to me. I lost my father in July due to his fight to cancer. He tired his damnest to fight...but the sickness overtook him. I miss him every single day. He was one of the bravest person I know. I love you dad!
You are a PHENOMENAL rapper, but the negative vibes you put out there are pretty ‘douchey’.  Honestly, just focus on your shit instead of talking bootie about another rapper.  What’s your beef with Mac Lethal anyway? It makes no sense
This is unironically the worst song I've heard
This is the same guy who made people so stupid and everybody hates me
This hits hard,my uncle just recently passed away from cancer,love you Uncle Rick,one day we will meet
Everybody knows someone who's sick Forty percent will get cancer, only half's gonna live Your mom and your dad and your sister stand inside a room And someone won't survive it, do you hope it isn't you? I swear that cancer has a cure, but they're refusing to make it They've done like forty years of research, ninety billion in donations We've been running for the cure and wearing ribbons for ages Why are people still going through radiation? It's fucking crazy Hundred billion-dollar industry, they can't afford to end it And nobody wants to die, our only option is to spend it We give anything to stick around for just another second Give a fortune to the doctors who promise they can extend it The profits are astronomic, the hospital and the clinics Of fillings coffins with dollars, it's awful, let's just admit it We're all human, we'll keep fighting 'cause it's how we survive But it's scary 'cause we don't know where we'll go when we die  [Chorus] Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart  [Verse 2] Nothing matters if you don't have your health All the money in the world doesn't help The good might go to Heaven and the bad might go to Hell But no one wants to leave here, you can tell And cancer touches everyone, it's in our genetics And our world's become so toxic, it's all carcinogenic We've polluted the water, the air; the food we're ingesting Is full of hormones and poison, our population's infected They sell us cigarettes and liquor, built a business on addictions We've been paying them to kill ourselves, we're dying to keep living It's the system, it's a prison, we keep trying to beat it We get cancer from keeping all of our demons a secret And our insurance don't cover the things we need to defeat it And even if it does, then we might die from the treatment Our best defence is living like we do not know what cancer is Fight it if you have it and pray that there's something after this  [Chorus] Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart  [Bridge] You won't know how to be brave Till you choose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength Till you struggle to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith Till you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take Till you realize you didn't break  [Chorus] Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart
So true! Just lost my mum to cancer and Im survivor now almost 7 years since heard those words. Almost didn't make it too.
Holy SHIT... Tom I just listened to Satanic Rappers. My jaw is on the floor dude, I mean...fuck man. Guys buy his albums. BUY his ALBUMS it's so worth it. I would have paid more had I known what I was getting
😣
Late to leaving a comment but Breast Cancer runs in my family so I know what it's like. My aunt also had it and so did my mom's best friend who died from it (It runs in my moms family)
Love the Video/music/lyrics, my mom died of cancer, it did bring a tear and memory
Thank you for this. My father in law has cancer
You are a fucking legend
My father passed a year ago on sept 24th you dont understand how much his song helps
He said 40% is ganna get cancer only half is going to live so does that mean 20% of that 40% is anna live or are we forgeting the other 10%? that was big brain time
My dad had cancer it was so hard watching it wear him down. Im so lucky he survived his treatments. This song hits the heart so much keep it up Tom
This hit home so hard my mother passed in 06 from cancer along with 2 aunts and a childhood friend all with in 4 months. Now im 40 married with a 5 year old and my father in law was recently diagnosed with lung cancer.
14 years exactly since my grandma’s death from cancer, still feels like it just happened today.
8 years I battled that bastard cancer    it's like an MMA fight with an invisible person and what ya body has to go through to beat it omg          Ur lyrics are gold bruva Australia is loving your music we proudly bought all Ur albums homie
The doc looks like his eyebrows went thru a round of chemo 🤔
This song it's home this was a cool drop share some love brother #hangovergang
Rip Mom you fought so hard,.
I smoke, drink, n take pharmaceuticals every night to sleep so that I dont have to think about a way to say the words that you r saying. Thanks for putting all the words together that I am too weak to do. I hope your words change the world.
Props for having the doctor played as a black man
Dam this hits home  😿😿 my mom was recently diagnosed with cancer
my brother had cancer and I was with him for four months we shaved our heads together and 2 weeks later the day of my football game my mom told me he passed I didn't want play but my mom convinced me I played and scored four TD and 600 rushing yards and I believe it was him but still no one deserves it not even my worst enemy

BEST SONG OF #2021
🔥🔥🔥
There is something after this. I'm dying. I know it. But I've lived my life. My husband is waiting for me. I won't make it to 40
WOOOOW A GOOD TOM MACDONALD HOOK!? Wow awesome shit like wow this is truly an amazing song. This gives me goosebumps I too lost a loved one to cancer and I still cry. I miss my grandma and the fact she hid her illness from us until she was too sick to keep up the facade is so crazy to me like how do you do that? She was one toughest ladies I ever met. She was a flawed women but I'd still would love to see her one last time.
This really hits my heart my grandmother has cancer and she means everything to me and I really want to lose her....she has a good chance of surviving but this makes me have hope that everything will be okay bc she is strong and a fighter.
I've Lost so many to this!! Been fighting it my whole life.   Thanks for this song Tom!!
Have you seen "the devil we know? " Documentary on some shit.. like some shiiiit..
I lost my mom Sept 9th, 2012 at 1800 hours. We were blessed that she survived for 2 years at stage 3 and 3 years at stage 4 Breast Cancer and only 30% of cases are the type she had. Her paternal grandmother had the same type, survived it and then passed from lung cancer. We don't know if it is every generation or if it skips generations... Was one of the worst days I ever lived through. Tom, I became a fan from someone sharing one of your first videos with me. I love your work and how you come at it from the heart. Please never stop being you
There ABSOLUTELY IS something after this! I love you all!
I love your voice!! 💜  Your messages are so true!
I wish my family followed my advice and do natural cures
Love this song. My sister is going through the struggles of breast cancer and just had a double mastectomy.
I had cancer in my family
Their are ways to cure it, in sweden you can get a shot where they inject a de-clawed virus with a cancer cell inside of it, this teaches your immune system to view caner as a threat which is the only reason  its so deadly your body doesn't view it as a threat.  or if its close to the skin you can go to japan and they'le take this thing that heats up  to about 68-74 Dagree F which can kill any cancer thats close enough to the skin.

Alkaline diet switch it up you’ll cure yourself 🙃🤙🏽
Thank you Tom.
Frances Inez Russell I will see you soon mom!
It was amazing and a sad song why I sad that was because my grampa has canser in his longs
All I can say is that's real bro, thank you. We need to chat...
Beautiful song.
I watched most of my love ones die of cancer, this song is great for awareness thank you 🖤🥀
This made me cry so hard, I was 12 when I had to go through that, I was so scared I was not gonna grow up, now today my second baby is 1 week old and with him I almost died, and I'm 24 my body is still healing, I wish this song was around back then, but it's good to have it around now thank you ❤
You spoke my exact words I been saying this for a very long time. They got the cure but won't ever give it to us people only the demons in the political world. Otherwise they wanna keep making money off the medication and hospital bills seen it to many times
Thank you for this Tom, my mother passed away Saturday morning from leukemia and now it's hard because I lost my best friend and now I have to go get her ash's. Fuckin sucks.
pls help i am dieing inside
“Alan Park’s Green Crush Podcast” — This is the cure 100%. Alan went from stage 4 to healthy af

Rip linda k talley and jerry talley miss y'all both
Heartfelt
❤❤❤❤
you can thank the Rockefellers, they will never release a cure.
Tom... Thank you...
I dont know who you are. I dont follow your music. I dont have a clue about anything you stand for... But this Is highly respectable and I give you a nod of approval.
As the sole survivor of a floor full of cancer patients at Wyler’s Children’s Hospital in 1996...  This hits home SO much...  I try to remember every day that I am here and no matter how bad things get I will roll with the punches and push through because all my friends are watching me and cheering me on and I know if they were in my shoes they would live this life to the fullest for me every day 💗
100 billion dollar industry is the exact reason why they won't release a cure for cancer because the gain money off peoples suffering
At 0:35 I was singing along and thought you was about to hit us with **MINUTE** instead of **SECOND**.......Love your work bro, keep bringing the heat 🔥
Rip chadwick
I would love to interview you. I want to know your story, and I'm sure your fans do too. You're the realest rapper I know, and I hate rap. I am definitely a fan of you though.
R.I.P Faze chemo. you are in a better place anas.
Lost my mom October 10th of 2019...Stage 4 lung cancer and aggressive brain tumors...This song hits home so fucking hard.
I lost my mom last year to a tumor in the brain they did surgery but it have her seizures and the one time my dad left the room she had a seizure and died she missed my wedding and the birth of my daughter I miss her so much !!!!💜💜💜💜
This rapper is so brave! He absolutely refuses to make good music!
Thank you. This makes me think back to when I had cancer. I'm still trying to handle the psychological damage from it. This helped me alot.
I was scared to listen... but I'm glad I did... my dad has stage 4 small cell lung cancer and stage 2 bone cancer 😥😥
I speak the truth too, I feel they are coming for me too.
Beautiful Song!🙏🏼💕
Tom Macdonald = always breaking boundaries.   Keep it up brother ❤
My mom... RIP. THANK YOU <3.
Weird. This came out the same day my dad got diagnosed with cancer. I love your music man. Tom your an amazing person. Keep doin you man. You are awesome
Not just cancer. Even HIV has a cure but they'll never release it. We just gonna continue suffering while someone gets rich. Sometimes I wish i had magical powers to reveal all secrets that powerful people hide
whoever disliked this is a foot
When will I see this guy get 500k likes on a video? He gets so many views.. is it because the algorithm ?
This hits hard. I was just diagnosed with skin cancer. This song couldn't have come out at a better time. Ill be vlogging my journey. Thank you Tom for helping me find my strength.
Tom...my grandmother died of cancer when I was 9 years old she was my everything then my grandfather died of cancer when I was 16 I watched him die of this horrific thing, being 20 years old now the pain still haunts me and this song specifically by you I just have no words..all i know is you are the most truthful person I know in this world not just in your music but you yourself and the heart of gold. You’ve inspired me your music keeps me motivated and your music brings strength thank you.

This is the truth!!!! I’m watching my Mom going through hell every 2 weeks with aggressive treatments. One word SUCKS!!😥🎀 #Cancer
Thanks Tom, Hard to understand what people are going through. I'm almost 5 years clear and I thank my doctors for the advice and decisions. I feel for the population that believes that chemo is government funded to make a pfofit. It's such a get fucked situation  and hard to believe anything when it's you
my best friend killed himself and he loved you and madchild. never listened to you until now and man i wish he would have listened. you should be huge.. you got talent kid.
Lost my dad in 2017 to cancer. This one hit me hard. This is amazing and this song broke me down....
Dear tom , im a 18 year old girl from egypt and i’ve been studying the iluminati and the new world order and the fake matrix we live in since i was 11  and have been called crazy numerous times , it would be a dream came true if i had the chance to talk with you ( no cameras involved ) . I have also battled with depression , addiction and other mental disorders like BPD and PTSD . You inspire me by always speaking the truth and not fearing the consequences of spreading awareness of the things that truly matter that are overlooked in today’s society , please consider replying to me one day ❤️Thank you
This song hits hard. I am so thankful I found your music.

😲😯 dude
over 50 scientists got killed that were all in charge of finding a cure. Right after they said they found the cure
You are my hero Tom you always will be! 🙂
This made me cry my mom has cancer😔
For everyone that is fighting cancer or knows someone that has it look up GcMAF it's a protein that eats cancer cells https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqCJSutl-aQ
So true
I love this 🥺❤️ My dad got cancer in 2017, than lost the battle in 2018 ...
Who tf could dislike this they don’t understand the loss of a family member to cancer
Why dislike!?!?!?!?!
I'm really shocked you don't have more notability I'm really shocked I haven't seen you on TV somewhere you're a really smart young man
Gives me peace knowing that this younger generation you may look different but we got the same ideas
Total badass dude you just keep making hits one after another I'm really glad I found you I wish you peace and your family God bless you brother
This may not matter but I’ve been going through a lot and I don’t know what to do and I feel alone and I just want help 😣💔
My child being born, Me being married to the woman I love, Are no longer the happiest part of my life the happiest part of my life is, is when the doctor walks in the room and says no cancer.
Song makes me sad I love your music 🎶
I wish Tom macdonald could make a video about people  with autism
For real keep up the good work bro
Thank you for this song I needed it. I have cancer and it’s really hard.
has anyone gotent a msg fro a fb page called tom macdonalgift sayin you won somethin fr wonderin
brilliant xx
I gotta be honest, if Tom keeps going this way, then I'll respect him a lot more than I did previously. It seems like he actually wants to branch out and get more helpful music out, which is admirable.
Damn, well I didn’t think I’d wake up this morning and cry as a 36 year old man. This one hit me Tom. Love you brother
I say; remix, that includes the cures. 🤷‍♂️😂
bible says we are in a fallen world, it goes back to adam and eve, we are in the end times ( end of the world ) . God stepped into history 2000 years ago in the form of Christ, to save us from our sins and to give us ever lasting life to those who believe on him..
I hate your ads but your music is here. I wish the cure for cancer was here. I wish I can be here longer to see more potential from you. Theres morr to come.
Tom Macdonald is Real AF. 😇❤️
The treatments for cancer PISS me off. THANK YOU TOM for this song, it’s been on repeat several times a day for 5 weeks now(I’ve got your CDs so heard it before it dropped), it IS helping
My father had cancer last year and thank God THANK GOD he beat it ❤❤❤ everyone asked him his secret he said eat your vegetables , home grown. He's 75 I love him
I had cancer 2 times in ma life when I was 3 days 1 year old and when I was 7 years old, ma body was 76% and second 24% cancer in my blood I never thougt about dead but it's there I was always happy , I'm 18 now and still struggling with the side effects of cancer but I life, and I thank everyone for it, and i thank you, when i listened this song i cried, I let ma parents here it also and they cried too, thank you🙏🙏🙏
Hey Brian hang in there .. from Virginia and Keith
All the dislikes are "Big Pharma"
Hey Tom please contact Tim. Tim Pool would love to have you on the long form interview that extends the natural mainstream media allows. Please bridge the gap. Allow us who support you to be gay and proud. I love you my brother. <3
Not many songs make me cry this one does though! This one hit way too close to home. Thanks for the song bro!
If everyone used magic than they could cure any illness but so many lie about it and try to make it evil.  Its the biggest Unspoken Truth fo all.
I wondered for yrs what was wrong with my dad only to find out 2 months ago he had cancer this whole time and never said a thing he lived life gave me lessons i can hold onto forever and pass on to my kids so thank you for this song man it reminds me of my dad and he was a fighter
I'm about to buy all your CDs signed man I love you and your music it's a great change of pace
the bars in that song are some of the realist shit in any song ever written...
This is checkmate to all his haters Tom has so much heart true godsend
If it was proven that they had a cure but hid it from the world those responsible should be put to the sword.
Oh my god. Blown away bruh.
Thanks ♡♡♡♡♡
This song Speaks the truth watch simbatvs video its awesome
Dam tom. My heart strings bro.

Thanks for this ! Found out alittle over a month ago my mom has cancer . I sent her this song the first day it came out and can't lie it teared me up a bit . To anyone fighting keep it up !
I lost my grandfather oct. 26 2019 of a brain tumor, he was in ICU off and on through out the year then he told me he loved me as me and my parents along with my 2 younger brothers went to a trunk or treat thing at a church.  It wasn't but ten minutes later my uncle came and said "It's time",  after that day I tried to harm myself twice, and run away three times, I haven't talked to my grandmother because my grandfather is who kept us together.  It's been hard without him, but its life, you live just to die.
Beat stage 4A prostate cancer. Hardest thing I ever did. But now they found an unrelated brain tumor. I don’t have the strength to fight anymore but I must.😢
I teared up and i feel gay! lol Great job Tom!
Thankyou from NZ Tom you lift me up!

Wow brings up my grandmas 8 battles with breast cancer and subsequent death last yr during the summer time. Then I found out I was having my little girl then she died this yr a week before she was to be born. There’s always so much hope but death always has its own plan amd it’s never fair.
You're awesome bro🤘made me cry thinking of my grandma I lost to cancer and my cousin who went through bone marrow transplants and is remission 5 years now! Rap game needs you!!!!!🤘
Thank you brother for this my wife has cancer shes definitely a fighter
So tell me did you know that you were a comforter that the Scriptures talk about don't deceive your self in false reasoning if you have it normal know one thinks there someone that's why you are so don't let it go to your head be real SPIT truth he's got you.
This song hits deep. I have had so many family and close friends have cancer. Today marks a week that my father figure died of brain and lung cancer and a year since my aunt Pam died of cancer. She got ate up. I love you tom. Thank you for this.
My father just got diagnosed with lung cancer 2 months ago and having to juggle working and keeping up on wverything already hard enough through this pamdemic then finding out my fathers lungs were full of fluids and he had to get them drained at the hospital and thats when they found the cancer in his lungs i try so hard to not breal down and have an emotional break down durimg my shift 6 days a week and this song as helped me pull through these hard and rough times thank you so much tom
Lost half my family to various forms of cancer so this hit awfully close to home
2014 I was diagnosed and refused treatment although a DR. actually threatened me about my choice!  Hey, I had a Mum to care for because she had cancer.  We did the treatments!  It killed the Mum I knew.  Three years she fought and still died!  Sooner then what they had said.  So for 3 years we were the victim of a violent crime that resulted in her murder!  After I agreed to have an operation.  It was followed by another.  The second surgeon told me there was NO REASON for me to believe I had cancer.  Imagine if I had done those treatments?!  They would have ruined me while living!!  Don't  do those fucking treatments!!  Please, don't do those fucking treatments, they are deadly and they only piss the disease off.  It will come back with more ferocity then it had before.  Its not about years its about quality of the years you have left!
Eat better. Stop eating sugar. Cancer solved. Big ups Dr. Sebe
A friend asked to watch this and listen to your song. This is such a powerful message! I just found out 2 days ago my dad has stage 3 lung cancer. His body is too weak to handle treatment... They are giving him 6 to 9 months to live. This stuff needs to go away and they need to find cures for this massive killer. My heart is broken thinking of losing the one man who's taught me so much.

Cancer really really sucks man
This hit home for me. The last 8 years ive been surrounded by cancer. I helped my mom fight. She passed in 2016. During that time i was helping my best friend in the whole world. 20 years of her being my best friend. CANCER is a wicked thing. Breast cancer bone cancer lung cancer and brain cancer. All suck. Thats what they fought. Every day for 6 years each. It has dam near killed me. Im in do much pain on a dayley basis i cant breath most of the time. My borthday is sunday. Im not looking forward to it. This song hit me right in the heart. Every word is true. Am i going to feel lonely for the rest of my life. I dont know. What i do know is i habe to keep fighting. Thats what they would want me to do. They were my heart. And now its gone. Thank you for this song
Thank You ,Tom! I just got your signed cd's in the mail :D  My mom is a cancer "survivor", its not been easy for her and the rest of the family. the treatment they game her (chemotherapy) destroyed her, she can no longer work, and she get exhausted for just go buying groceries. the "medicine" and treatment they give all cancer patients are wrong, we all know it, they know it, but nobody dares to talk about it, the pharma industry makes way too much money on cancer to really go and find a real cure. you and me both know the cure is there, but in most places in the world its illegal and if its legal its not recognized as a cancer treatment... we live in a sick world.  Thank you Tom for giving us truth and hope. Keep doing your thing and we will support you all the way.   Say Hi to Nova from me, love her "problem" song!  (and thanks for putting the value on the mail at $10, didn't have to pay tax on that! hah, f the system)  Love from Norway (PS, my mom usually hates people who has tattoos in their face, but after I showed your music to her she loves you!)
Played this for my mom last niggt and it had her crying and smiling at the same time .
They must have a cure for cancer
Swear this made me cry
The sad part is he is telling the truth, their will never be cures for anything man kind can greedy make billions on. Think of this the people you vote for to be put into Government places knows this is going on and puts prices on  people lives by letting this happen.
Thanks again Tom. Music worth listening to.
Sober and cancer is.....SO INSPIRING well sober isn’t it’s baccicly connecting to peoples lives
My dad died from cancer. I thank you for this song
Thank you
Terrible bald cap, Cancer kills the animals too, pets/food, don’t matter, humanity won’t survive, our alien parents will save us or kill us like species before us.... this attempted radio hit is no “I Wish”...
Oh your talking about yourself great cuz ur cancer
Both my grandparents died of cancer and I have generalized anxiety disorder almost every night I am worried about if my parents get cancer
Truly inspiring
This was deep. You can tell how emotional he was doing this video
Watching my dad die from brain cancer this is definitely a fight song for cancer patients. Keep up with the truth!
Can I tell you something my grandma died the day before you posted this by cancer she had brain liver and stomach cancer
i love the message of all his songs it’s like f the haters f everything life throws at you just fight like hell to live, like actually live, and don’t succumb to your addictive personality, addiction, and mental illness. just live your life and try to be positive. you’ll struggle and life will throw some shit at you but just LIVE.
As someone (who is not looking for attention) being depressed and my brother having cancer it’s a amazing song and I love your music have fun making what you making                    Also if your going though anything just know that you do have strength to get though it
Please  tom make a video of dementia!!!! Please
https://youtu.be/nDJLTFIfiII
I lost my Dad to chemo two years ago. His body tried to fight it, and went septic, and it killed him. His birthday was four days ago. I miss you, Dad. Thanks for this song, Tom. Jim Cody 1949-2018
Hey Tom, call me?
This is why I have so much respect for Tom he speaks nothing but the truth even when it hurts. Keep it up man
rip dad
Dam bro,I love this song.. hard for me to listen to tho😢...
Tom thank you this hits home hard . When my son was 3 the was diagnosed with Wilms tumor kidney cancer . seeing him go through what he when though changed my family's life forever.
This song hits so deep that it reminds of my grandpa.  He passed away from stage 3 cancer reaching stage 4.  He went to the hospital and went through radiation treatments.  In the end, he died of toxins in his system.  The hospital never that he went to never wanted to save him.  His pain has brought great pain in my life and affected everyone in my family.  He was a great loving man of God.  His last dying wish was that everyone in the family live in peace and get along.  I keep his memories and image in my heart to this day and what he stands for.  Thank you Tom MacDonald for making this video and song.  I truly appreciate it dearly.
Thank you for telling my cancer is bad Tom🙏
My cousin is fighting a loosing battle with stage 4 lung cancer, and spread to several places.  She is on her last few moments on this rock.
My mom had cancer before she had me, if she died I wouldn’t be here today. She is so strong.
Awesome song. Thank you, Tom!
Had to wait to listen to this...just lost my aunt to cancer. U rock dude
20 some years ago in high school I shared the opinion that cancer was an industry that too many were financially invested in for them to allow a cure. I got torn apart by the whole class and that's when I knew that most never look beneath the surface of an issue for the root cause. And that's why we make no progress on the worlds issues.
A great straight forward read that should be shared https://shophopeandbeauty.com/blog/cancer-and-lifestyle-the-correlation-worth-looking-into
I discovered Tom MacDonald today and for real there is no turning back 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well 230 am, this mourning my grandpa Don passed away from Pancreatic Cancer. I missed the call im crying.

Cancer funny

Yes such grate sing and meassge! Preach it.
You speak to my soul, brother. God bless you Tom
"We've been paying them to kill ourselves" that hit so deep right now!!!
Hows a song mixed with comments give one goosebumps
Love the message you send bro
Fire Fauci, now!!!!
Stop smoking. Stop drinking. Read the ingredients on your food before you eat it. Exercise regularly. Drink lots of water. If you’ve got extra body weight, you don’t need to eat 3-4 times per day!! Being healthy isn’t easy, and it’s not a 1-2 week thing. It’s a life style. If you want a long, healthy, happy life with your family, please take care of yourself.
I Lost My Brother who was 27 yrs old to Brain Cancer and 7 months later my mother who was 48 to lung and kidney cancer. It has been 17 years now I miss them every single day! Love this song ! ❤️
My 10 y/o son and 11 y/o daughter just lost their daddy in February to cancer. The doctors lied to us. This song is amazing! Dying to keep living! Prayers for all the fighters!
My mom is a breast Cancer survivor and my work honors the breast Cancer survivor and the ones who are still fighting and the one we have lost every year during October. I appreciate every day my mom is still here. And I applaud the ones who are still fighting this cancer.
It's been 2 years since I lost my mom can barley talk about it don't know who to blame just so much rage thanks for the video makes me feel not so alone in this cold world
Tom you gotta get a singer on your hooks your hooks be fire plus your lyrics are on point
Wow . He actually made a fight song for those suffering from this madness that's man made ?? Smh god bless you all !!  #WeAreTheSame  🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
My mom has 2 different forms of cancer right now and my sister died 5 weeks ago. You're music is helping me a lot
Omg tom you never stop amazing me bro with the truth you speak bro I'm more than a just a fan of yours because the words you speak I feel like we are family man I love you an have never met you in person and your the only musician in any music genre that has ever mad me feel like that bro an that's is why your successful keep doing you brother we all love you so much respect we have for you
People who hate Tom McDonald are just stupid plus for all the mean comments are necessary and whoever is saying them you must be out of your mind because Tom McDonald is great and if you want to keep on making mean comments you might as well be pointing them towards yourself
I sent this to my aunt and uncle who are in the hospital fighting as we speak  Thank you for this I love you!
Me and my SO have been listening to you for years and love your music. My mom and best friend was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer this year only a few months after I had her first grandchild. It has seeped into her bones from her lungs. I was terrified to listen to this song but it only made me feel better. Thank you so much. I am so scared to lose my best friend and my favorite person in the world. Thank you for giving me strength to get through the rest of this nightmare.
so good
New to HOG, love the music Tom & Nova. This one hit close to home. Our 3rd oldest daughter was born with a solid mass tumor in the small of her back, removed at 3 months old came back at 6 months old. She went through 3 rounds of chemo. She is 7, cancer free and considered a survivor, but dealing with side effects of chemo, daily migraines, and other long term issues. There are no chemo drugs that are specific to kids,  and only 4 to 5% of government funded research goes to pediatric cancer, thats not a specific type, but all childhood cancers. September is also Childhood Cancer Awareness month.
amazing
I sent this to one of my moms and it made her cry
Amazing song man. Brings tears to my eyes everytime. Such a powerful message for anyone dealing with any hardship. You are a world treasure my friends. Makes me proud to be a part of HOG.
Thank you for this. My grandmother passed away 3 years ago from lung cancer. Biggest loss of my life. Now my besties mom is fighting breast cancer. I've walked this walk with them. She's doing maintenance chemo now. #STILLFIGHTING
Love you man, I had stage 4 leukiamia when I was 5 , an stayed strong  through each day till I was healed, this song makes me look back at how the struggle  was but I nvr gave in an believed in my family. This was a good song an hope everyone else thats going through these hard times I pray for you that you have the strength to fight an break free
I heard the song within minutes of being posted and it's good. But today I'm listening on repeat and balling my eyes out after dreaming of my grandma that fought cancer twice within 5 years of passing and was found to have it a third time during her autopsy. She was a fighter!
true King 👑 Tom im sure it will help people 🤔😓😓😓😓
Nothing but love Tom an Nova!!! I could use help right now.... I drink alot.... An take alot of pills.... You r the sunshine in my rain..... Help.........
So when all ppl on earth die do we just sorta respawn?
Tom.... you are a fucking artistic genius dude. Thank you.  Please don't stop doing you and preaching the reality that most don't see. The world needs you and this..
THANK YOU TOM FOR USING YOUR PUBLIC PLATFORM TO BRING THESE ISSUES TO THE FOREFRONT.  THIS IS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT, LOVE AND STAND BY YOU AND NOVA. MUCH LOVE TO YOU AND ALL THOSE WHO SUFFER WITH THIS DREADFUL DISEASE.   ❤❤❤🙏😪
Vote Trump
We LOVE your music!! A friend of mine shared this video with me the day after you posted it. Our daughter, she is 8 years old, had a biopsy done the same day you posted this video. Just wanted to say how awesome, but very ironic with the timing. We noticed a lump in her abdomen over a month ago. It's been appointment after appointment, blood work, protein infusions, the biospy, etc. The last 2 weeks have been pure hell. She was healthy prior to us discoveringthe lumo, no symptoms whatsoever. Official diagnosis came back this past Friday, she has Hepatocellular carcinoma fibrolamellar, they say it has metastasized into her chest cavity in between the blood vessels to her heart. They want to start treatment soon, it's been so unreal from the start to now. We've been told the only way to save her is to shrink the tumor so they can do a liver transplant. We just thought they would tell us she had a hernia, we never imagined they would tell us she has a rare cancer that happens 1 in 5 million, her liver was healthy, they say she was born with Chromosome 19, that's how she randomly got this, just a bad card dealt to us/her through genetics. We are absolutely terrified of the treatment options and what they will push on her. We don't have much faith in doctors or hospitals due to past situations my husband and I have dealt with. Just hoping and praying that God heals her and protects her as we try to navigate through these rough waters. Your music speaks to us! Keep being a badass! ❤
We can all relate and bro you speak truth! Thx for standing up!
That chorus is on point....
Noticed Tom's steam has died down. Subs have stopped. I remember him and @nolifeshaq were tied up at a time. Hope those face tats work into your longer plan. Maybe manager could have helped you blow up. No-one knows your name.
My  grandmother got Brest cancer and survived
Also just realized that the Doctor is the same actor that portrayed the teacher for Whiteboy.
Can come up with vaccination fir covid in months but how many years may can't come up with some of her cancer interesting.......
Thank you so much Tom Love the Truth you speak x so refreshing x:)
In my line of work (Fire/EMS) I have read that us firefighters are at 68% higher risk to get cancer. I've been a firefighter for 3 years (since I started as a volunteer at 18) and I've watched 3 brother firefighters, one from my department, and the other two from different department die from cancer. At some point this has got to stop. To those currently in the fight, we support and pray for you. For those who survive, we applaud your courage, and to the fallen, we remember your life and fight.  And to Tom Macdonald, thank you for sheding light on this issue through your music, and being a inspiration. Keep up the great work
Amazing Mr Tom... #Fighters
my dad had cancer, and since i was young when he had it i don’t remember much of it but im so thankful that God kept him in my life
Thank You ❤️❤️❤️
Just lost a friend today of leukemia. She died on her daughter's 5th birthday. My friend's 15 year old only has days left. Pancreatic. Im a damn wreck today 😭💔
Bro, I seriously respect you, you are doing the right thing! Thank you for spreading the truth this way! I am humbled to meet you! Adi Shakti!
Thank you for all your songs and all the hard things that we want to say but we never do because were afraid what everybody would think you are awesome brave and I believe in your message
TOM PREACH... Don't let them kill u and clone u .. This happens... talk about it.. like i talk to ....... U  ... ... . Nerds
Celebrities always recover from cancer. Weed killer put in our Cheerios, flouride in our water, shit is getting out of hand. I just lost my dad to cancer last year. He was 52. One of his favorite things to eat was Cheerios. I have so much fucking hate towards the Elites now. I wish they would all get cancer and become eradicated so people could stop being poisoned. You monsters are people.
Everybody in world going through this be strong ❤️
Took me a week to listen to this. I didn't think I wanted to hear it. Great song Tom
Most cancers can be prevented by diet and a few basic supplements and just learning how to treat your body well, also its possible that vaccines are the cause of most childhood cancers.
I found out on OCt. 10th that my Mom has stage 4 cancer in every organ in her body. This song has given me so much hope. Many tears cried while listening to this. Thank you for this song! You have gained a lifelong fan due to this
Amazing song tom, you are the greatest singer alive
Great song I wish chadwick could have heard it before he passed from cancer
Thank you for this song !!! Two time cancer survivor here and it has been a rough road along the way but I never gave up !!
I know people my hate what im writing but the truth is we all need to work on ourselves love is the key on changing the world lets all grow as people and it does not matter what color of race you are we can all learn from one another we must not be control by anyone of this world like the people in power remember that everything in this life is connected time to unplug and reprogram our minds and heart and soul and fix all parts of our realms read and educate yourself and wake up the minds that is sleeping remember that he that knows everything knows nothing i pray for all of you i might not know anyone but know one thing i care for the world and the people in it i love all of my brothers and sisters and remember your never alone we all have divine light
Wow!!!! Blown away... just when I thought you couldn’t get any better!!!! 😯
Why people are not liking this more positive outlook song than the more aggressive songs? Guess it sounds to leftist to get rid of cancer with science instead if hippy shit?
Yikes.  Didn't need to wake up and make myself sad watching this...
But there's no profit in it!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ifXxbxhZc
Song was amazing man thank you
Just got my CD's! The audio quality is fantastic for the format and Tom's talent shines throughout. Got em sitting in my Bose CD changer right now bumping away! Great job dude!
The first person to invent a cure for cancer will be world famous and make billions of dollars from the patent.  The baseless belief that every medical researcher in the world is evil enough to cover up a cure is super offensive.  Tom is just using cancer for clicks.
I wish this help me
I had from Tom Macdonald;"cancer is a demon". Is it true or What guys?
Tom you are one of the best artists to ever grace a microphone period thank you for never disappointing and consistently making amazing music
This give me more power fight, thank you

Take it everyone on here lost someone to cancer. Lost my uncle 2014 keep it going 👇🏼
It would be very hard to control cells that have been mutated and no longer take part in apootosis
My aunt just passed away it was a gruesome battle. My best friend who passed away in May 14, 2020 (R.I.P SEAN) his moms passed away from Cancer. It hurt him so bad. I wish I could have done more for Sean. But, then again I'd rather keep remembering the good times.
This is beautiful! God Bless you bro! ♥️
Tom you and Nova are a bright light in a dark world Thank you for another song that’s touches the soul brother Best wishes to both of ya
As someone that’s lost three people to cancer ... I had to fight back tears watching this . For those that have cancer keep fighting !!! For those that have lost people to cancer there always with you , keep holding on for them .  Bless you Tom
Man, I cried like hell watching this.  I lost my dad in January after a tough 2-1/2 year battle.   The morning he passed my brother called me to tell me if I wanted to see him I needed to get there.  For the last 5 months before he passed I spent every weekend driving to my parents 4 hours away.   I made it 2 hours into the drive when I got the call he passed.  That was the toughest drive I've ever made in my life.
I just lost my memere yesterday morning because of cancer. My family is so heart broken. Seeing my dad cry and my daughters cry, broke my heart :(
The media and certain political standing influences hate this man so much that they won't trend this. It's sickening how deep these roots go. Blocking this is evil when there are people who need to here it.
There is hope Tom :-)....John 14:6 -  "Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no one come to to Father except by me."  That's our hope in this world...Jesus who conquered death has given us a way out when we die.  We all will die one day, Jesus beat that enemy called death to save us from hell.  :-) Jesus also said: John 15:13-17 - 13Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. 14You are My friends if you do what I command you. 15No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not understand what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because everything I have learned from My Father I have made known to you. 16You did not choose Me, but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will remain—so that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give you. 17This is My command to you: Love one another.
Dang this hits deep
I cried so much listening to this.. my mom's just got over cancer...💚💚💚
cancer is a degenerative disease due to lifestyle choices. amygdalin cures acute malignancies, and a proper diet and proper supplementation of ascorbic acid treating hypoascorbemia should keep one pretty healthy.  the Trump presidency is a direct response to a very real awakening to pervasive government corruption, and it looks like a confidence job  https://youtu.be/mM8qpxp9m2U  https://youtu.be/Fh2hfbcPjOw  #Texit  NOBODY cares about the poor.

I am type 1 diabetic and this song is sad to me
2 songs in less then 10 minutes,  stupid and cancer. The words are so true 👍
Dude favorite rapper best beats and best vocals
Man i use to see this guy as another sixnine a joke but this mans come far starting to really get into his grove and message
My mom passed away on 1-26-2020 from pancreatic cancer.. This video made me tear up.. Hardest thing I've had to deal with was someone else's pain. Wish you all good health.
Great song Tom: But hey! GREATER NEWS, bro. Jesus Christ died on the cross for you... and for all that believe in Him. Do 1 thing if you're reading this. Read Ephesians 2. The entire chapter. IT'S REAL. LIFE AFTER DEATH. GOD. JESUS, WHAT HE DID FOR YOU. YOU CAN'T EARN IT. YOU CANT LEARN IT. READ Ephesians 2 (Specifically Ephesians 2 Vs 8.) Proceed playa!
This is the best I love what you do
wow! Tom.... I kept watching you talk about how your video was bringing tears to everyones eyes., Well I just watched it and then read through most of the comments and DAMN! SAD AF !! I THINK ITS GREAT HOW YOUR SONGS INSPIRE PEOPLE TO NOT ONLY LIVE, BUT TO GET UP AND FIGHT !!!! KEEP IT COMING. HI NOVA ROCKAFELLER (LOVE U GUYS, JUST GOT MY BAD NEWS HOODIE IN THE MAIL LOL)
One word. Amazing. Best rapper of 21 century. Keep it up tom. Fxxk the haters. We all behind you.
Hell yeah ,. I love seeing ppl. Like u to be up front and have it in u to show the world that I have a 💝 , and DO CARE ABOUT US AS WE CAN U . So much appreciate this song . Keep it real and open ur self to these kind of song's more . 💯, From the SOUL .
Getting better this one style it's more fitting than the other more hardcore rap songs. But damn we need something uplifting this yr man it's been a hard one!  But the same criticism idk maybe it's just me im not a fan of anthem sing along songs lol. But other ppl like it then cool its just not for me but its still the weakest parts of any of ur songs. Only constructive feedback no hate. It feels like we're trying to fit a square into a circle shape peg by trying to mix rap with singing along style chorus just feel very out of place n like the focus should be on your strengths like you got bars so spit thatd ur talent maybe have a female sing? Or something to spruce those parts a bit if you really want to keep them or work on then n grow etc. So that's all I got again same thing itd getting better each time tho. Idk I'd just focus on my strength n try to sharpen that lol. But thatd me n I don't do much so just make beats and DJ a bit for fun now ffs cv sucks
Thank you for saying this! My Mom died from cancer when I was sixteen (it was a rare cancer and she lived longer than predicted please don't listen when they say six months it's just an estimate they told her that multiple times). I used to say the same all this research and they don't know how to cure it? They come up with things you may have been exposed to but you're never allowed to think it might be bc of how much we've altered our food or our world.
I survived Esophagus cancer when i was thirty today im 38
My Dad died Aug 2nd 2019 from colorectal adenocarcinoma. He was my hero. So big and strong he used to be a drill sergeant. I watched him go from over 250 pounds down to about 150. He never complained he never got mad or upset. He led by example always. Ill never be the man he was and wouldn't be able to handle 3 years of chemo and surgeries like he did. Hes my hero and i miss him so much. Fuck cancer and fuck big pharma thats made a killing letting cancer kill. Its so so sad. We need to wake up and see the truth! Great song! I love it.
My grand father has battled cancer 6 times and has pushed on and is still strong to this day, thanks for this song going to show him!
That's because its all about money they truly don't care about no one ! Just dead presidents shit crazy
Whoever see this, just know that your not alone, while I believe that if your a Tom fan. That your woke and are aware of things that go on every day. We all know that the government has cure for probably damn near any type of disease or virus. I also would like to believe that you see the truth of this election and that the picture they paint of the president is not right.  Read, investigate for yourself, don't believe everything you hear or see.  For anyone who has been diagnosed or is in remission. We are here for you, your friends and your loved ones. Your not alone.  I can't imagine your pain  nor will I act like I understand cause I don't. Only you do. What I will say is this.  What life has given you it isn't fair, and what you have to go through to live for another day even more so. but in my eyes your a hero, you are the light and the hope that this world needs. I say that cause None of you ever asked for your circumstances but you answered the call. The same way a soldier answer the call to fight our enemies. While your enemy is an invisible for the most part. You do what needs to be done, You fight tooth and nail, you sacrifice your body, your soul not knowing what the day holds for you. You may not see yourself as a hero, but us the ones who witness your battles, the ones who cry with you fight the fight with you. Your inspiration. Your hope. Your all the things that this world needs in it.  No you didn't ask for it, but here you are Fighting like a true Warrior  We are proud of you. Thank you
Tom is a Legend
Tom thank you man for this song I lost my mom to pancreatic cancer in 2016 it sucks.its been so hard to keep my life right since then.much love man.
This is... this is amazing... I can’t describe how happy this makes me... cause my moms going through a lot of crap rn we don’t know if it’s cancer or not... but she’s slowly dying and this... reminded me to keep my chin up... thanks Tom <3<3<3 love u so much man
This is a sad song i almost cried
2.8k people who have no heart... cool
Don't see how anyone could dislike this. Crazy world

I think you are so talented an brave Tom,.....
This song is gonna help folks keep their heads up!!
Thanks brother for I have cancer love this song
Thank you for exploiting the truth
Tom!! I've been saying this. All of this! Thank you for saying it out loud. Your platform should definitely get it out there.  I hope ppl jump on is.
Just be a poet
This song gives me chills every time.
😭💙🌎
Vibrational waves will kill cancer cells, but company's cant make a profit
This song has so many emotional points... well done @tom... saddest part about this song is that the lyrics are true!
Thank you so much for this song! It means so much to me. I have lost way too many people in my life to cancer.
BRILLIANT.   An Amazing lyric song and so so true. Thank you. ;).
Cancer is a multibillion dollar industry. enough said, we live in a world that doesn't solve problems because they are profitable.
"Brighter in the dark"
I'm a cancer survivor, and I love your music! It took me a week to finally get the courage to click on the song. I'm definitely glad I did! #HangoverGang much love! @JamieRush0312 on Twitter
Its about time someone says it even better that he sung it great song
If you’ve ever been close to death, you care less about heaven or hell. Death isn’t rememberable. It’s literally nothing. I was pronounced dead and never even knew it after drug and alcohol poisoning. I woke up in the ER my clothes cut off and was told by the most beautiful doctor everything that occurred. That’s when I realized angels only exist on earth. Dying sooner rather than later is tragic
my moms mom died before i was born so i never got to see her cause of cancer .  my mom has is a few pictures of her
Its sad bro you have 2.8 trolls who just hate to hate and have no space in the world for those losers. Repeat every day I listen I will comment.
Thanks from new Zealand, my step moms sitting in a cancer ward right now with advanced stage four breast cancer the doctors said they can't stop it spreading as she starts chemo and spends another week in there with who know how many more we the family feel helpless asf,.loved this song an we know if anyone will fight she will,. #respect👊
This is so beautiful. The message people, listen. Love you all.
Wow tom mcdonald I absolutely love that song, see I lost my dad back in June due to lung cancer and it hit all of a sudden to he went in the hospital the day before memorial day and passed a way almost a month later June 22 and the doctor said they tried everything thing to save him.

I would give this a thousand thumbs up if I could!
Nothing but respect for Tom & Nova. Been fan for awhile and I will always be a life long supporter of both of you through the the thick and thin. This tack brings the haters and lovers together.  We all bleed the same colour. Let's all realize we have way more in common than our differences . <3 <3 <3 Love each other even when you are afraid. Fight the good fight !
Great job Tom, as a social worker, professor and Veteran I would love to hear you drop truth on some more of the world's most wicked society problems such as Homelessness,  Poverty, failed Education system, Environment, Veterans Mental Health/suicide. Would love to provide statistical, personal and professional insight for any of those topics.   Fight on Tom! Thank you for not giving into trap crap or commercial garbage. -Real Recognize Real
Hell ya bro I have a lot of respect for you 💯 to stop and do something that will bring a smile to someone's face that might have really needed that smile you helped give [MUCH RESPECT]

Great song brother. Keep up the good work
Word speaks. Brings legions of angels just by itself. Brings rivers flow that never find the ground below our feet. Thank you ❤️god bless yaall!
This guy is trash lol
Your music is real. Keep up the great work
Honestly the fact that there are any Dislikes on this video at all makes me sick to my fuckin stomach. Whether someone cares for his music or not he is one of the most emotionally open, fact divulging individuals in his industry. This is a strong and heartbreaking topic. He is opening minds to a better outlook and promoting motivation to the people around him to keep fighting. The key to a lot of his songs seems to be the happiness and knowledgeability that he shares. Nobody could do what he does in the way that HE does it. Think about what it costs or costed to spread this kind of pureness to people. I have been watching since the beginning and your making leaps and bounds! @Tom MacDonald Loved this.
I don't know anyone close to me that's struggled with cancer, at least not yet anyway, but I straight up cried from this video. If you weren't moved watching this, find your heart. You're missing something, and it's the one thing that makes us uniquely capable of healing one another, physically, emotionally and spiritually.
I just found out last night that my uncle has cancer and today I stumbled across this video. Thank you! 😭
Listen bro, i got introduced to you during quarantine with your coronavirus song and couldn't believe it. I kept telling my friends "who is this guy" he is something special. This track struck a nerve. I gotta good friend who goes for stem cell treatment almost every week. He doesnt act like it but i know it bothers him to know any day could be his last. Gotta say man please dont stop. I know you make everything on your own and your showing the industry something special. God bless you Tom. keep it up.
This truly is a masterpiece! truth in all the lyrics.. good song Tom thank you!🙌
😭😭😭
Truth
5 DAY of quitting smoking after 15+y, i make myself the ultimate test, tryin' to drink 1/2L vodka without a smoke. I struggled baaad, but then, "we been payin' to dying' hit me hard and get me through. Thank u. 2020 WAS A BAD HEALTH YEAR FOR THE FAM!! KEEP YA HEAD UP! BLESS YA FROM POLAND!!
My grandpa has stage 4 liver cancer this song hits home friend with stage 1 throat cancer she gets surgery next week I'm scared for her
While listening I saw myself dancing which hasn’t happened since being diagnosed
Keep doing what you are doing, Tom, your messages are needed in this crazy mixed up world....
God bless you an everyone who needs it. Thank you
I'm not crying. You're crying.
My grandma died this May on the 25th this year. She had lung cancer fought it for 3 years and she was the strongest freaking woman I’ve ever met. I was young so i didn’t know what to do for her my cousin Samuel have her a playlist of music and this made me immediately think of her. I think she would have loved this song.
Thanks bro my mom has cancer so this helps me
Thank you man you speak the truth singing real sh!t and demi Lovato is crying about trump and bs
My grandpa passed away from cancer. It's tough to watch someone you love and admire just wither away in front of your eyes...
Wow amazing hit home I lost 2 uncles to cancer one this year thanks for the song Tom your amazing brother keep pushing
Best song of this year along wit every song y'all make praise God for y'all
Tom I finally got my own pre paid phone !!!
People will hate him just because he speaks truth.
It's not just Tom. I watched this, saw all the positive comments. Keep them flowing. I appreciate people sharing their life, their experiences. We've all been witness this year to hardship and the aches and pains. I appreciate each and everyone spreading positivity through these comments. I suppose I was meant to stumble across this today. We all have our demons but together we can create life and a knew meaning to humanity. Cheers to all yall reppin the good vibes fightin the good fight.
My grandma just passed away last night... I’m gonna miss you grandma😭
I lost my grandmother/best friend to cancer, it's been 2 years and still every day is a struggle but I have to keep my promise that I made my grandmother so I got no choice but to remain strong
Cause the cures marijoana and non gmo foods👊
Should do a track about Dupont poisoning the World.
Well said 👏👏
Thank you Tom. This made me cry.  Beautiful.  My mom was just diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer and going through treatment.   You are a amazing person
I listen to alot of rap but then my parent showed me u tom and it changed my life because i knew that there was actully someone that i could listen yo that spoke the truth pf life and not them selves A lot of ur rapper are seld centered but u are not. U care about everyone mak8ng good songs for the world
There is no money too make when there is a cure
Just a thought but didn't former president Jimmy Carter claim to have his cancer cured with cannabis.
I love the messages Tom gives out but every song sounds the same
All the money in the world can't save you when you're dying
Lost my mom this year......thanks Tom.
I have never commented on a song of yours and I have listened to most of them....... but I wanted to say thank you Tom on this one!!!!!!
Are the 2.8 k stupid that disliked this song how can u dislike something so true and so personal to us all every single one of the 2k will know at least 1 person
How can anyone hate this song my dad had mouth tumor. 2 years AKA cancer of the mouth. I just don't understand people sometimes.
Love this video
Why'd she cut her hair??
lost a unborn daughter to cancer back in 2016 RIP shiva love your music dude keep on going like thomas the train
Ian Paul Emsley 13.10.1964 - 01.02.2015.  Miss you  and mum till my last breath 💔
Some cures to cancer I have found: stinging nettle tea, Nigella sativa, 7 apricot seeds a day, sunlight. Believe and thank for your health, like if you've already overcame it. And the most recent one I found.... resonant frequency therapy. Everything has a resonance. Cancer cells are vulnerable with high frequencies between 100,000hz and 300,000 hz. Look up James Bare. Everything is vibration. Find the right resonating vibration of the disease and you can terminate it. But the hospitals won't tell you this, or they truly have no knowledge of it. Heal with sound.
Thank you.. this hits hard.
From Tom to Tom : important message and great Words ! Thank you, Tom ! Cancer must go!
Thank you Tom,  great song , I found out I have cancer , I m afraid but I'm still strong 💪  n I'm fighting,  keep it up tom ur awesome 👌
I just lost my father to 4 stage cancer. I took care of him until the end because my mom passed 9 months before him. It was hard watching a strong man turn to nothing. I miss my parents so much after they're gone you wish you had just one more day with them.  So if you are reading this love your parents while they're here, they can be gone in a heart beat.
That's crazy how this world can have Radiation, Chemo, putting the person thru all that and still no cure for Cancer, but this so-called Covid-19, out of nowhere comes, and now they're working on a cure in a vaccine. That brings hhhmmmm to the mind. Questions of what is really going on. All I know is an agenda is in the process. Something greater is coming, and it might not be good. GOD have mercy on our souls, and meanwhile, people have mercy and sympathy for others as yourself. GOD bless everybody!
I have a brain tumor and the doctors said that they can't remove it and its terminal
my English class is talking about theme and I brought this up to my teacher for the theme in the song and the teacher mad it part of the lesson
Ive gotten told to kms bc of this guy. Me supporting him as made ppl hate me. But if u think about it. Im still a huge fan and a real fan i aint goin nowhere, i love you tom great music!☺️
The more you need it to survive the more they exploit it.  We live in a world of business, not cures.  I'm 34 years old and my mother has had cancer off and on throughout my whole life.  She's beat two types of cancer, and she's currently been fighting the third (stomach cancer) for nearly 7 years and honestly it's not looking good.  Cancer cells are meant to be evolutionary cells that have been polluted and turned into mutation.  They know how to detox your dna strand just like they know how to pollute it to cause cancer.  They love playing God and feeling in control of life or death for everyone else.  It's been long overdue that we open our eyes and see the world and truly ask why are things like this - and realize that they don't have to be.
Beautiful!!!!!🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭😭😭😢🙂
Thank you so much for making this song. I have been fighting cancer since 2013. Started in my tongue. Heck, I had never even heard of that! They cut a chunk of my tongue. Put me through 7 weeks radiation. EVERYDAY! They would make a pass over my mouth, lower the machine and pass over my throat (oh yeah, they cancer in my right lymphoid in my throat). As that was going on, I did 7 weeks of chemotherapy too. My 1st visit, I sat in the recliner & pulled all my hair out. I was SHOCKED! Went from 6'2" & 210lbs down to 156lbs in that same time frame.    Went for P.E.T. scan & was CANCER FREE!! 😁  Doctors said if I go 5 years cancer free, I will have beat it. That was in May. Went back to work as an industrial controls electrician. Way too soon, but was very broke.    My friend CANCER came back to visit at Christmas...same year. So now I have had it 4 times, but still kicking. I'm 9 months past what doctors gave me. Had no choice. My wife and I are raising 3 grandkids that we had to become fosters to. Both bio-parents surrendered all parental rights.     I MUST stay alive for 7 years, or wife and kids will be homeless.    Please pray for my family.
listen imma keep it a buck with you I really don't like this dude(  its just not the music I like no hate brother) but this song is nice and a hella good message so i subbed and liked the vid. keep up the positivity tom.
So many hate him but he really just care and tries to show our flaws or problems good or bad
I love that your bars are flawless but bring an ACTUAL statement. No bragging, just real life shit. Whatever your beliefs are man god bless you.
Damn..
I grew up with an older brother who had Cystic Fibrosis. They told him he would be lucky to see his 18th birthday. I watched him fight through treatments, double lung transplant, and new medicine that would "help" I was lucky to learn strength of will and not giving up on yourself or your dreams from him. He saw his 32nd birthday, and then the disease finally won. I watched him teach a doctor that the will and determination of a human with nothing to lose, is the strongest thing in the world. He would have been 34 this year, and there are days harder then others. Thank you Tom, you see the world differently, and we appreciate that.
Bro this is the true I have lost 4 family members to it including my mom and dad, dad was only 25 years old it is very irritating to watch people go through this thank you for this song
Tom is the Realest dude I know! he says everything everyone is thinking, but don't have the balls to say out loud. SALUTE BRO YOU ARE A REAL HERO 4 WHAT YOU ARE DOING KEEP IT UP & GOD BLESS U & EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
After watching this I immediately grabbed my son and hugged him
Lost so many to "cancer treatments". ❤
Thank You
You legend TOM MACDONALD
I feel tears bro 😭
Thank you for this one
Hey, brother I know you don't me but I've been following you for the longest. My Daughter got Diagnosed with an uncurable brain tumor known as a DIPG the same day this shit dropped. I could not comment that day because of how hard the news was, I just wanna say thank you for your thoughts lyrics, and wisdom.  Great stuff man.
John 14 ~ Jesus
Couldn't be a better song for Cancer fighting. Just wish i heard this 4 years ago for my mom...she had a short lived miracle with fighting cancer..link to her miracle and inspiration.https://youtu.be/S7s6qfJoBIU
Bro......
Man i lost both my parents to this man so yes I do love this song cuz cuz it's also the love ones go thru this too
I always loved your music but this is one that hit me the most!! Thank you!!!!
My uncle is currently dying from brain cancer, he was diagnosed 5 months ago, he went from working a year ago to not having any short term memory. I am a nurse and can do nothing to help. He will probably not make it much past christmas.
Dawg this hits deep my grandma passed away on Memorial Day from her battle with cancer. She fought a strong 8 years R.I.P lola Rose may your soul rest in paradise.
Wow. Thank you Tom. That was beautiful.
Hey Tom, I'm a nurse at Md Anderson #1 Cancer Center in the world. You perfectly described what I see daily at work. Thank you for your music and I know this song will impact so many. It's a masterpiece.
Love you tom
Thx you for this one
Yo omg this means alot alot to me
My friend has breast cancer and they were doing her preop paperwork and found out her medical insurance was canceled. It wasn't even up for renewal tell next year. I'm heartbroken for her. Please pray for her, her name is Cris.
https://youtu.be/u8KyjHnXi18💪🔥💪
My grandmother had leukemia. She went through treatments and it didn't help her.  The day she passed, my aunt called asking for my dad, he wasn't home at the time he was working. Anyway, I was the one who was told the news about my grandmother passing and it didn't really hit me until her funeral. I cried like a baby at her funeral, I was 15 years old when she passed. I miss her and what sucks is, I didn't really get to spend a lot time with her.
What a great song 🙏
RIP Mom
iv lost 1 tomany loved ouns to cancer from pets to people the demons of that vial didease better b gr8ful to god their spirits n that spirots thar cant b harmed phyisically or ide brutally slay every last 1 of them without a single shred of regret or drop of mercy leaving only carnage n my wake like a true slayer i pray soon covid n cancer shall meet a violent end n that r medical relm clensed of greedy demonic puppets who worship mamon n sacrifice the very patients who count on them to make good on theor oath to heal n do no harm to its endless thirst for innocent blood thats y i love mamons depiction n land of confusion as a fat evil manopoloy man litterally made of money kicking back drinking blood like wine n smoking innocent souls like a cigar with a arrogent grin 😂 such a perfect image captring mamons natire of blood souls n money the unholy trinity of averice thats the very demon man has given power to lets hope r vengeful one comes soon to destroy this demon
Cancer does touch everyone. It doesn't matter, good or bad. I spent 10 years from 15 to 25 living in 2 5 year abusive relationships, tried to commit suicide many times, yet helping others with their depression. Once I got myself out the abuse, I get skin cancer. And ive already had one surgery that took 5 months to heal and I need 3 more, thats how fast its spreading. Thank you Tom, I really needed this...... like im ballllllingggggg. You touched my soul once again.  I really hope I get to meet you one day, also when I subbed you only had 64k subs. <3
If you think about it you have to pay for doctors to help you. If you don't pay them they won't help you, and you may die.
hey @Hangovergang  I im fight a disability i know this is alot to ask could you make a song about epilepsy.
Speak it brother. Let the world hear it. Fucked up the world we live in. And Cancer is no joke. My best friend/room mate died of Cancer. I watched her go thru it during treatment, until I couldn't bare to see her go thru it anymore. I abandoned her. I will always regret that. I needed to be strong for her and I failed. Be the change you want in this world. Don't walk away.
Y 2.18k dislike I did understand
I needed to hear that. I lost my mom in 2018 to cancer. This song is amazing love it
This is so true... My aunt died from cancer I don't usually say my story but they told her with money she will live... They gave all they could she beat it but got it back.. she died doctors said that they would save her they didn't.. this song is so true
Tom for president when?
Not often do you make me feel sad man, this hit home thanks!!
😭😭😭why wust you hurt me in this way          For comtext: my paw paw has terminal canser ( non cureable ) and we dont even know id he will make it to next year and I was suuuuuuuuper close with his parents (great granny and grampy) and they passed away early in 2020 (I was the favorate great grandchild) and it always makes me cry when I think that they were so close together and I might loose my paw paw also so close together it kills me and in Christin (it dosent matter to the story) so I beleave their on their way to heaven and I wish I can visit their grave more than I can and I beat myself up every day bc I always wish I could spend more time with my granny and like a week after my granny apeared in my dream and said "I'm okay" and I woke up crying my eyes out im pure happy ness that it helped me get thru a ruff patch in my life and help my not fall into a depression   So if your still here I hope you the best in life and if you are having trouble commint and I'll pray for you 🙏🙏🙏

My grandpa has cancer and he is strong as heck sometimes I can’t even tell that he has it
1:12 Still Beautiful
https://youtu.be/qu28VlD7Tj4
How could anyone dislike this !!!!! It's so true canser effects us all RIP grandma
16 YEAR SURVIVOR! I WAS ONE LUCKY ONES TO SURVIVE! I LIVE MY LIFE TO THE FULLEST! MY DOCTORS GAVE ME 6 MONTHS TO LIVE AFTER CHEMOTHERAPY! WHAT HE SAYS IS PROBABLY TRUE ABOUT A CURE. MONEY IS THE ROUTE TO ALL EVIL AND CORRUPTION, AND THATS NOT JUST BIBLICAL. IT'S A FACT!
Man...this shit hurts.
Lost my mom to cancer 5 years ago, she was given 5 months, so we started planning, getting everything in order, she made it a year and a half. in that year and a half she helped the doctors deliver my oldest son, she went from a healthy woman to a frail skeleton, but even to her last breath she fought hard and refused to give up, hospice care kept telling us “it won’t be long” day after day for 2 months straight, she was the strongest woman I know! Thank you for this song 🙏
0:53 Love this moment
Just to add on....I had dropped out and shunned many of the support systems I had tagged onto after first diagnosis.  Now I see the strength of the system.  So when I pray it isn't for me or my family it is for all who must carry this load.  I wish God's grace and generosity on each and everyone .
Great  song and kits a bit close to home losing my twin to leukemia when we were very young. Always wonder how things would be like if we could have grown up together
We just lost someone to cancer and have another one with only 6 months. I can not get enough of this song,
This song really hits home! Its not often a song brings a tear to my eye and trigers memory's. That last  3 minuits was filled with memory's i thought i had forgotten. Memory's of my grandfather & grandmother from when i was a child. For the first time in a long time i got to see his face again clear as day and remember listening to him giving me some advice. Advice i will never forget  "Never be someone your not just to please people who hide behind masks themselves " Thanks dude your music will change the wold 🤙  Amazing song 🎵♥
ABSOLUTE FACTS!!
My dad is investing in a company that is making medicine for a couple deadly types of Cancer and the results are looking good
"Fight it if you have it and pray there is something after this" thats is a powerful line and words to live by.
Right on big facts to this tom so much respect to u 🙏🙌💯
Wwwow. Gold Tom
Damn Tom this is a side of you I like, but let's not forget that your message will span everywhere. Amazing message and amazing song.
Tom McDonald for president 2020
I am a Marine vet and this hit hard. I have lost so many family members to cancer a brother grandparents and more. Tom this for this.
For real !
My mom has cancer. Thanks man ♥️
No wonder what the reason was to dislike this video? 🤔
My son died of brain cancer 11 years old.  Beat the first cancer, treatment caused a secondary cancer that was inoperable.  8 million roughly or more cost of treatment.  I wonder why... after all the possible good treatments you hear about  that get stuck in the FDA process.  At least he got to go to saint Jude for some of it.
When I first heard of this guy I spelt McDonald's wrong lmao
I don't even understand how anyone dislikes this song but they've never lost someone to cancer....  keep it up TOM, love you're music man!!
My mother in law died after a year of diagnosed cervical cancer she met my daughter she died 2 weeks b4 her first birthday we have her ashes in our front room as her husband lives with us he wont let go until he can join her
My Mom just got diagnosed, I've cried all day long. This makes my Mom, two Grandmothers, Aunt & Cousin 😭🙏❤💔
Please never change your music. Your the greatest ever.
I just found out my grandma just got cancer she is stamge 4 pancreatic and only has a couple months she is my best friend my mother who raised me instead if my actual mom and I'm losing it 💔 knowing she is goin to be gone soon and there is nothing I can do this woman made me the man I am today and I'm afraid when she goes I'm goin to find a way to be with her....
Tom bro this song hits home for me..I lost my dad last November to cancer,that is the ugliest 6 letter word I've ever heard...R.I.P POPS
Just found out I have cancer. Fucking dam. Why?
You are amazingly talented. 🤩😍
Thank you my mom has been fighting since 05" just thank you Tom I'm trying to hold it together she has covid since Sat
I know you won’t see nor read this but: I’m fighting brain cancer and have finished my first year of chemo and now I’m doing radiation.  Your message is accurate and hits hard as it should.  So, thank you.
My dad had cancer the year I had gotten married.. It took him so quickly.
I'm crying
Cancer is the worst horror show and villain of them all. Too many friends and family and people we admire lost to a disease. Fuck Cancer!!! Stay Strong!!
I have lost nearly 2 dozen family members to various cancers over the last 20 years and have always believed there is a cure, they just dont want it made public since the medical industry makes so much off it. Ironically I have been lucky so far, my health is horrible, I suffered 5 heart attacks in a 13 month period and died twice, but I figure it is only a matter of time before I am diagnosed with cancer myself. Thank you for this, this is the true awareness that people need to recognize. 90+ billion in donations alone, you'd think people would see this and get a clue. I can't even get a $10 voucher for a sandwich and have lost all sources of income because of COVID, my channel doesn't earn crap anymore, but I bet cancer centers still get millions a day to fund the studies of a disease they have conveniently spent decades researching, but know nothing about!
this is so sad. I am crying so hard please help
Wow.. you are awesome for this. Your songs really uplift and inspire people.
Cancer is it really real cuz covid is fake and who knows everything mite just be the media b.s and everyone was lied to since day 1
I don't care for rap. But bro I hear you! Everything  you do is next level!
Also seeing as not all of us have cancer the strands that affect people but doesn't kill them shouldn't we study them instead of the patients themselves, take this as you want but the way I'm thinking of this is good
You never know we can all be test subjects
My uncle is fighting right now this song hits a spot with me like none other 🙏🏽 for those who are fighting
Thank you my mom has lung cancer and it spread to her liver.. she is terminal.. I cry everyone I hear this I love my mother to no end. I do everything I can to make life easier for her. She is a fighter god speed and love to all...
My grandfather just passed... just got the call wtf it was cancer and kidney failure... Rest In Peace Terry Keith Alexander 🙏
💞🥺♥️♥️♥️🎗️
My Brother is 54 he found out he has Liver Cancer, When you said the Radiation will kill us, that's what he's going through. Love ur Lyrics & Song 🙏
Very powerful song bud. The video made it that much stronger.
TY SO VERY MUCH TOM LOVE IT LOST MY DAD TO CANCER WHEN I WAS 15 AND I HAVE A DEAR FRIEND FIGHTING RIGHT NOW WITH IT SHE IS IN NASHVILLE THATS WHERE SHE GOES TREATMENTS . GOD LOVE HER .
Your great Tom 👍
Tom you speak the truth!! Never Change!
Who is “downvoting” this message? Scientists?
This touched me so much! I come from a family who battled cancer. My grandmother and aunt had breast cancer and I had testicular cancer. Every day is a fight but when you have cancer not only are you fighting that but also your own body and immune system. But back to the point..... This video gave me so much strength I didn't know I had. Thank you Tom!
Thank you for putting my words to song.  Husband 8 years in, still going but end not far off.  God bless and know that every year we cry is one less step they must take. Bear the burden, love while we can but do not let the burden bury you.  live for you and them!
damn its so true keep it up tom they hate when you talk about real shit like this...
They’ve had the cure since they made it all about them making money ! Sick & hurting = money for big pharma and everyone involved !!!!
Thank you for making this, Blessings. #HOG
This one hurts my mom just got diagnosed with terminal lung cancer 2 days before this dropped she’s 53 I sent her this song and we listened together on FaceTime and cried together ,my daughter also just hit 1 year since her diagnoses of ATRT brain cancer 🥺🥺😢
***Correction: The doctors aren't making a fortune, the insurance and pharmaceutical companies are.
I listened to about 52 seconds of this.. Till i lost it all😭  I just got diagnosed and this shit is real everyone.
God gave us a command to Love! We have such a short time on this earth! Love others like its your last day, God has another beautiful life for you after this!
This one hits home ive been fighting against cancer for 2 years now but i still believe ill get through this.
Thank you brother. I lost my baby girl when she was 3 to liver cancer. I pray each and every day that they would just give these poor children the cure that I am confident they have!  Much love man
My father was just diagnosed with liposarcoma and this is such a beautiful helpful song
This touches deep places
My grandmother passed a little more than two months ago. She had breast cancer since 2013. She suffered for 7 years. I’m just glad her suffering is over but I’d do anything to say goodbye.
Tom IS cancer.
My boyfriend is a fan of yours and sent this to me. I love it even though it almost makes me cry. I have been cancer-free for seven years, two months, and 11 days but have lost a mom, a grandpa, an aunt, and an uncle to it, plus have two more aunts and another grandpa who have survived!
https://youtu.be/flzao07PyII
Dam I love you Starseed.Thank you so much you for singing my daily rave with music to it.im 52 and have been a professional singer/creator and you got me in tears man.Yr heaven sent.Dont stop spreading the most important messages.LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE YR STUFF.
Theres to much money in cancer even if they have a cure (which they probably  do) they would keep it a secret to many people make tons of money off of it. And money means more to them then people's lives  unfortunately
Really needed to hear this right. Don't give up. No matter who you are or where your from I love you.
@TomMacdonald and Nova. Wow, this is such a powerful and inspiring song. It literally left me speechless and in tears the first time I heard it. You are a truly gifted and talented man with a huge heart. And Nova is such an amazing, beautiful, and loyal woman. I believe You are doing what the Lord put you here to do and I wish nothing but love and happiness to y'all. #ihateCancer #TomMacdonald  #NovaRockafeller #HOG #F∆©KCANCER
Best chorus you have had in a while, the melody and sound were very catchy. I would love to hear more like it. And it might just be me but I would also like to heard you switch up the song composition some. You have been stuck in a rut of, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge chorus. For a few tracks.
Last year i heard news of a younger girl i went to elementary school with had passed away. Not done being a teen before she left and went back home to Creator.  Also makes me sick how some doctors will also say some have cancer just to make more money.
Tom... your are just you. You put words together and allow everyone to embrace you everytime you speak. Crazy to think about honestly... you are holding it together champ! Keep all this up!
This song hits home to much 😭
Your song has touched deep into my ❤ thank you
my dad had cancer when he was 12. They didn't have a cure but he God helped heal him and the doctors were confused. The battle lasted 3 years but no he's 52 and plays soccer with his son...me
Tom you always have some great stuff. But fuck man this one is deep and hitting me hard
The people who disliked this video are going to hell or hopefully somewhere colder. They are the most heartless buch of fucking cowards plain and simple. Love you Tom keep it real man! 💯🙌
I didnt think id really cry but the more i listened it made me think of my mom when she had cancer..
Waiting to see how Anthony Fantano can badly react to this🤔
This really hits different when you know people going through this
this was beautiful
Life had been pretty good for me and my wife up to when i did my 42nd, birthday. I was married for four years and enjoyed my job and my work colleagues. The only exception was that I was experiencing a few minor health problems that were more a nuisance than anxiety-inducing in the previous few months. When I first found my wife's breast lump on a self-exam I was exasperated that another thing had to be checked out. I fretted that my doctor was going to think of my wife's as an hypochondriac with all my little complaints. Even on the day for excision of the breast lump, I had been looking forward to a holiday the following week, not realizing that my wife life was about to change enormously. Triple negative breast cancer wasn't even known. But De lord sent an angel to me who helped me cure my wife's breast cancer, right now as i speak to you my wife is doing really fine by the power of God and with the help of Dr uwembo the herbal man, i am so greatfull to him without him i could have lost my beloved wife. if you need help too you can contact him. via Email  (druwembo@gmail.com) Call/WHATSAPP him on +2348115881958 PLS Share to save others as well !
RIP mamaw ❤💚💙💗
This is deep and some won’t understand this world is really fucked up bro I really hope to meet and talk with you one day🧠👁🌏🧘🏾‍♂️ #spiritualyaware
No money for a cure
Good job
I would like to personally talk to anyone who disliked this video
I hope you do well in life and go as far as you want. Amen
Yeah don't be foolish the government's controlling everything and use the sheep
Take a look at this reaction, Tom. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRIBcOTM29U
Damn my brother is dying from cancer and he’s a fighter right now, my brother could go any time now. This hit me hard

Damn those piano keys at the end😢
Wow, amazing work Tom and Nova.  Love from the heartland.
Tom i have followed your whole career your castles song touched me from the fact i had dui and killed someone when i was 17 that song has what really helped me bc ppl dont know anyones background they always look on the outside and this song touched me on the fact when i was 14 yrs old my mom got breast cancer and i went to all her radiation and kemo appointments saw first hand for 4 yrs bc they stopped it but she lost breast and hair and then 3 yrs later she went back in for check up it had moved to her spine so it became bone cancer people have been judging me my whole life like why i didnt cry at her funeral im heartless and from my actions im a bad bad person but it was so relieving she had no more pain and is up looking down on me and know she is rip yet everyone always judges book by it cover and those judged may have alot more that you dont understand or care thank u thank u for always staying true to youraelf hope you understand that you always have and keep doing these song to you touch from just your lyrics YOU HAVE SAVED SO MANY LIFES SO THANK U FOR HAVING A VOICE and ppl should always express and have idles cuz you dont know what that other person been thru i stay hunble and thank you much love
my mom is battling stage 4 skin cancer, it kills me every time i have to take her to treatment, to another surgery, hear another doctor say "oh yes, this will definitely help" only to hear him say two weeks later "well unfortunitely it didnt work so we have to work around this". Medical care is a FOR PROFIT BUSINESS. Theres a reason every person who discovered a cure for aids, cancer, etc was mysteriously killed or they disappeared.
Good video and song.
I have no idea how people can dislike this song
this was great dude thank you and i bet someone will apretiate this 😭😭😭
Scary fact, every day your bodies ammune system destroys a least one cell that would've became cancer If it lived.
Cancer runs in my family,my mum's side nobody lived past 64.i have no family left on my mum's side including the kids.#CANCER SUCKS...
i'm sorry... but i can't listen this to the end. i knew you'd hit hard in the feels... but that just reminds me of my struggle i had when i lost my dad to lung cancer.

How Many People Are Diagnosed with Cancer Each Year? In 2020, roughly 1.8 million people will be diagnosed with cancer in the United States. An estimated 276,480 women and 2,620 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer, which makes it the most common cancer diagnosis. America is ran by cooperates and we are blinded by that, pharmaceutical companies and the military industrial complexes ran this country, they own both parties, Repubs and Dems dont care about the average US citizens, 1 in 5 children in US is living in poverty. Our foreign policies do not change, the old are shot callers and the young army men and women die in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria...... Dictatorship is a country where you only got to vote for ONE   candidate, we are one step above, instead of one we got TWO. We falling for their trap, wake up people!!!!!
Thank you Tom.
I have colon cancer.... Nice song!!!
Man I just wanted to say thanks for saying what the rest of us didn't have the balls to say. Just keep the truth coming.
Bless you Tom MacDonald. You say things most don't have the courage to say. May you be watched over and protected. Keep telling the truth.
My mother has cancer again. She beat it the first time. She got it again and she's at stage 4. She's refusing treatment because she wants to live her last days not miserable from the chemo and radiation. I'm so lost and feel so defeated. It's my mom. She's all I've ever really had. I'm at war with myself because I selfishly want her to keep fighting to stay here but I also don't want her to suffer anymore. No matter what happens I lose. She loses. We lose. I hate it. It's definitely made me bitter. :(
Thank You Tom for this!!!!
Then I will Come 😊
Hi Wish we Could Hang out If you Get this Tom McDonald's And you Want to Hangou  I want to Hang Out Just make YouTube Video And Say You want to Please please I loveYou're Music
Hi

You should do a day in my life video at some point
I lost my mom to cancer its never easy losing someone who raised you and the next day you wanna call them and they don't answer im still trying to see that she is in a better place
God Bless you Tom.
Way to exploit peoples pain surrounding cancer.
Fuck yeah brother! The amount of people this is gonna put faith back into is legitimately soaring right now. So many people needed this, I needed this, you jus seem to know what to do to help during this epidemic. Keeping everyone’s mind sharp
Love you man..one of my friend recommended me to watch your videos..and I think you teach us what the real problem is with this world and I appreciate your efforts in trying to make a difference..I am an aspiring rapper from India..and I think I found my idol/hero/inspiration in you..love you sir ❤️❤️❤️ please keep doing what your doing it helps us thank you..I have a mission to meet you in person someday and talk about life.love your well wisher❤️👍🙏
"But no one wants to leave here"   I strongly disagree.  I would do anything to not be here anymore, and have been asking for that since I was 10 years old.   27 years I've been praying and asking.  Support or not I know what I will do.
This is stage 4 lung cancer...found out too late
I thought all your songs were garbage.   Then you released this one...Wow. Really really impressed with this song.  The words, delivery.. amazing..  Good shit
What the fuck Tom MacDonald.... I always enjoy your shit. I wasn't expecting this... Hits close to home. Enjoyed it.
Let's be real right now who teared up
Lost my dad to cancer earlier this year. He suffered so much and he didn't deserve any of it. He fought hard and he would of given anything to live, but the cancer was too advanced. I miss him so fuckin much. :'-(
Tom thank you for this well need video my grandmother died of cancer she died a month after diagnosis when I was 17 I’m 21 now  and it crushes me everyday  thank u for being a savior in the industry #HANGOVERGANG 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
AMAZING!
Wow! Just wow! That put tears in my eyes!😭
Love this guy and love his music... but his ""acting"" in this video is terrible. Weak performance.  Good song tho.
Ngl you and eminem would make a good collab
This guys talent is unprecedented! Nobody can touch this guy! He has substance and talent all in one. Something these fake ass rappers know nothing about! Keep on doing what you’re doing man it’s amazing!
Tom macdonald i first heard about you going after mac lethal and I didn't hear your music but once I actually paid attention you honestly have so much truth and realism in your songs.  Hey brother you may have many haters but I'm not 1!!  Brookfield Connecticut has nothing but love and respect for you and your family!!!
He should do a video on the truth of the political game. That would go viral #bidenshouldbeinjail
I lost my Grandpa when I was 13 to Cancer. Watched him go from the strongest man in the world to nothing but skin and bones. He wasn't afraid of dieing, he was just afraid of leaving all of us behind. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
My wife passed away from stage 4 breast cancer 2 and a half years ago. It happened 4 days after our daughters birthday which was on December 30th. My wife was a true fighter and never gave up! She fought the cancer for 2 and a half years. I miss and love you very much Ashley
Woooow love the song brother awsome
My nanny is going threw chemo just lost my papa 2 months ago I’m crying this song 😭😭😭
How can anyone dislike this. Powerfull message
I really wish i could vibe with your hooks. As usual the lyrics and message are dope. As a song, meh 😒
I'm glad it was me.  Im glad I had it, instead of watching another loved one go through it.  I got to ring the bell.  I'll never forget how scared they were for me.  It's hard to watch people go through that.  I'm glad it was me
This song hits me hard. I have lost too many to cancer and I fought it myself for 8 and a half months. It was hell. But I still remember the day I was told I had cancer and that I had to go through chemotherapy I looked at my doctor and said, "well let's get started." And internally I immediately began to worry about my family and friends. I fought that whole time and now I feel better than I ever did before. I pray for a cure every day and I pray for everyone who has cancer. Its a rough ride. The chemo messes with your body and your mind. But even now I thank God im alive and I still wish the people who lost their lives to cancer were still alive. I had to make myself refuse to break. Even though internally I just wanted it to end. Stay strong cancer fighters.
My grandma was on hospice and just passed away on Monday from cancer. They gave her 2 weeks to live but she made it 4 months. She’s the definition of strong and a fighter ❤️. I found this song and it’s so genuine. Thank you 🙏
That is deep. I literally cried over a song that is meant for everyone. I’m sorry for your lose. I to have lost am also waiting for well my dads fait. Well this plant is over populated and the strong shall. Die with the weak.
I know it's a good message, but this dudes music is trash
hits hard. damn. big ups to tom macdonald.
OMG TOM MDONALD I'VE LOST  FAMILY MEMBERS TO CANCER INCLUDING MY PARENTS AND THIS VIDEO BROUGHT ME TO TEARS I'VE HAD A CANCER SCARE AND THIS VIDEO IS AWESOME KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK 🙂
If this doesn’t make you angry and want to cry at the same time then you are not awake yet. 👍🏻👍🏻✌🏼❤️
I am so grateful to shaqnolife for turning me on to you. My mom doesn’t listen to rap but this song made her cry. She is a two time survivor. Thank you so much for this song. You have a gift of truth that no one wants to speak on. I love everything that you drop
Another good one Tom
This means a lot to me I lost my best friend to cancer  2 months ago
Smile people😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌
Gimme dat cancer I'll gladly take someone's cancer you just take my dope sickness XD
Today we heard of another high profile victim of cancer with the death of Robert Redford's son: https://people.com/movies/james-redford-filmmaker-and-son-of-robert-redford-dies-at-58/
I love this because my great grandma... she is diagnosed with, with stage 4 lung cancer and she is 80 something this really meant a lot! My aunt is diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer.
If l haven't told you enough you and your music are amazing...this video made me cry so hard...please keep up with the awesome music..at least when l listen to your music l can actually hear the message in it...keep up the good work...l love you and your music...God bless you and your beautiful wife...
Wow man, this song had me tearing up and really hit home.
I'm doing a reach out for support and/or prayers for my best friend, he is currently dying from cancer, and I am trying to help the family raise the money needed for burial cost. His condition has gotten worse today, and they are moving him into Hospice on Friday, the cancer is causing multiple organ failure and only machines are keeping him alive at the moment. If you cannot or do not want to donate, that's cool, just a prayer for his family and for him would work. Money raised will be used for casket, plot and headstone, around $3500 is needed. https://gf.me/u/y48h8t
Sheite tommy me bhoy! Come down to irish cisco tx some day! Id love to give you a hand shake and a hug of love
Wow! GREAT!!!
Who The Fck gives a thumbs down to this. Keep it up man people need music like this
This song is very real my dad passed away from lung cancer thank you tom
Thought it would be a diss to his haters but I got something more!
S.o from 🇺🇸💀💯🤘🖤🤘  This shit hit home  💪💯
Amazing video Tom. I have lost people to cancer and this video brought tears to my eyes. Your music is amazing please keep doing what you do.
Who ever disliked this is going to hell
My mom is 10 years uterine cancer free and my uncle i battling  stage 3 pancreatic cancer and its bad and i 100% agree with everything he is saying in this video
If you thumbs down this song you have NO SOUL. SMH
You and your girlfriend are angels 💕
This hit me HARD! Can’t stop crying! My mom!
As someone working in the vape industry it is the sad truth.... pharmaceuticals are the issue not cancer...
Tom  realist in the game .relevant deep songs very current thanks for ur hard work keep it rolling.
i like your music .... this one is yer best
Tom tryin hard to make me cry
Cancer appropriation should be a thing. The kid had a bald cap, full eye lashes and healthy face muscles. My mother went through cemo 3 times. You do not look like this. Yes the song should be uplifting. But I feel like this is a cash grab on a heavy issue. Show the horror, show the sorrow. DONT DRAMATISE CANCER. It’s not this beautiful. You cant hug your loved one because they have that much radiation in their system you can get sick too. Don’t make me angry. I will fight you on this issue. I’ve been though this.
To much respect for you 👌💯
The song really hits home as my dad died from lung cancer the day after you release this video
Serious talent
Tom, Nova BRAVO.........
This song is so beautiful & moving. Let's fight all types of cancer including childhood cancer!
I love everyone of your songs . I think my fav is whiteboy . I love how you speak the truth regardless. Keep up the great job love ya
Absolutely beautiful.. To everyone that has fought this fight prayers sent your way.. Thank the good Lord I don't have this HORRIBLE thing called cancer.. It does hit home for me because I got home after being on life support and having to have my shin drilled into the bone for an IV to stop me from having seizures.. Have no veins left for them to give emergency medication.. I was awake then go into another one then start screaming from the drill.. Been fighting since the age 5 but I'm exhausted. Thank God I have two boy's that give me the drive to keep going.. I'm sorry I don't mean to take away from cancer and all the beautiful lives destroyed due to it, it just hit home for me and I broke down because I don't wanna have to fight anymore and hearing those words your a survivor just hits home because I shouldn't be here according to my recent visit to ICU.. I LOVE ALL YOU STRONG PEOPLE AFFECTED BY FUCKING CANCER! Tom MacDonald and beautiful Nova you guys are amazing, beautiful souls and thank you so much for the strength and very powerful and inspiring music.. Y'all have helped me in more ways than one.. From what I've been thru with seizures to PTSD.. I LOVE YOU BOTH! ALL THE LOVE TO YOU BOTH 😇❤🙏😢
Whats with tom with his horrible ass choruses good song still but the chorus
😥
I am a survivor one of my childhood friends got sick a couple of years before me she wasn't as lucky if I could have traded places with her I would have she was a better person than I will ever be love you always and forever Leah
Its called the Rife Machine.
This is such a perfect song for me at this moment my step father since 97 has cancer and drs gave him months to live as of appointment 2 days ago its taking a toll on his body and he's getting too weak to fight it i just wish a pray he makes its to Christmas! Thank you Tom  this most definitely will help with my situation better. Love your music. Godspeed
This really hits hard. My mom never smoked or did drugs and was diagnosed with stage 4  Metastatic brain/lung cancer in 2017. She fought and won and just a week ago we found it moved to her lower spine so it’s time to fight again
Hell yes Tom thank you for this amazing work of art!! You released this with perfect timing, my mother is fighting cancer right now she was just diagnosed earlier this year with stage 4, she is now in the hospital today because she can't even walk on her own. Thanks again man this helped my mother tons! Keep up the great work!
Bravo ! 💕💯🔥
Fuck man this hits hard in my heart  My mom has cancer that isn’t curable so this hits me pretty hard but still love the song ❤️😭
You’re the man bro. I’m not a rap fan, you’re my favorite musician. You’re the truth! Keep going bro. When you have tons of money give most of it away, start over again. Don’t lose the struggle for it’s what is so beautiful and strong. Enjoy it for a while. But not too long. Thanks for the honesty my friend✌️
My great grandma has terminal cancer & is now in hospital only had a few days. We’re already planning a funeral and my hearts broken 😞🖤
Thank you bro this song hits home I have two relatives going through cancer both I'm very close to
All I can say is I don't know how there are negative comments on this .i was 31 years old when I was diagnosed with cancer. I noticed something was wrong with me  When I was overseas in Afghanistan And I couldn't quite breathe very well. Even tho I made it home safe the problem was still there.  So when i got it looked at  I was told I had masses all over my lungs, lymph nodes and was moving to my heart. If they didn't find it when they did i would be dead. I went through 12 months of chemo and radiation. I have been cancer free for 3 years now and still service in the United States Marine Corps. I was told from the Doctors that there is a 50% chance my cancer will come back and I told her to bring it on because Marines never stop fighting. Cancer isn't a easy thing to deal with and I pray for everyone that is fighting it and know if you stay strong you will make it. God bless you all and  Semper Fidelis.
Read some interesting articles about cancer, it seems to be curable if found early enough. Lots of people have been cured by eating organic, lots of vitamin c. I think we've been sold a lie about cyanide too, lots of benefits to it and only kills the bad cells apparently. I'm no doctor, I just looked into it after my mum died of cancer 7 years ago. Remember that most illness in any regard comes from what we put into our body. Peace.
think about it we spend money on rocket science and have gone to space many many time yet all of the research for cancer and yet nothing.
Yo this hit the heart good song
Its cuts deep😭😭😭
my grandfather died from cancer in 2017 and i thank you for this song it really opended my eyes on thing so thank keep doing what your doing your the best music artist i listen to
This song has me laughing 😂
Dude I felt this song like realy felt it I had a cancer scare about 3 yrs ago and I thank god it was binine and wasn't cancerous but if it was it would have been my fault considering i was a tobacco dipper and since that day i haven't bought a can of snuff
Anyone who disliked this video or didn't get emotional has no heart. This man speaks truth in every song. Keep fighting the good fight.
Tom never fails to release great music! Naturally talented.
Found this song as I'm getting my treatment for breast cancer💙💜💙
Tom, my husband reached out to you now I am. We have a five your old son whom is loosing his battle to terminal brain cancer (DIPG) this song is amazing.... your music has made our son Raylan smile he loves your music..... it has also made our family closer MANY of your songs have hit home in many ways!!!! He will never stop fighting for him nor will he loose his battle to cancer. Cancer will never win.... God bless❤️
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
I gave you shit when you were doing diss videos and I gave you slack when it looked like you were virtue signalling but I'm man enough to acknowledge when you struck a chord in me with this music video. Kudos Tom, touching video and truly in awe. Mad respect for you.
I keep sharing your stuff and nobody seems to get it like me. Keep strong Tom you’re a badass!  https://www.facebook.com/100000218772424/posts/4084134248270494/?extid=0&d=n
Whoa.....deep but so very needed, thank you Tom McDonald for understanding 💗
Straight 💯.. you and your wife are amazing and wonderful people and the voice people need to listen to. Love ya stuff... Keep them coming. SKÅL
Wow
My sister died in 13' from cervical cancer. Left 2 young kids behind😔
respect fucking massive respect! We all know these hypocrisy's going on and behind it all is greed. This track is to the bone man love it! Hope it provides comfort to those suffering and hopefully a better understanding of the truth.
Great message and video Tom! I have lost many loved ones to Cancer. I know where I am going when I die not only because my Bible tells me so but because the Lord has shown me He is alive and His Word is for our freedom and survival. God bless Tom! God loves each and every one of us so much that He provided everything we need to live the lives He gave us, to answer each question we have and a promising future of what we have to look forward to when our bodies fall asleep. His word, tells us that all we have to do is put our full and complete trust in Him and He will provide. Putting our complete trust in Him, is to know that no matter what happens bad or good it is for His will. We may not understand it or think that He doesn't answer our prayers but His will does not work for our time but His. He tells us that being absent in the body is to be present with the Lord.
So many people need this🥰 Thank you
My mom died of cancer when I was 27 days old. Her mom, father, step father and my step mothers father died of it and various other people I knew had it. We all know at least 1 person that is effected by cancer and it is such a sad and difficult thing to watch or go through. I wish nobody had to go through it. For those who have i hope your heart can heal and you can be strong.
❤️❤️
Rest In Peace mom I miss you so much I love you mom so much ♥️ #fuckcancer .
Also the gov does have cures for all different kinds of illnesses. Cancer. HIV. And more. The reason why they haven’t made any public is because there is no profit in cures. The money is in the repeated treatments that patients have to endure. Greed is what’s stopping these cures from seeing the light of day. It’s sad but true.
First I wanna start with saying I am a big fan of yours. HangoverGang4Life.  Earlier this year (April 23rd, 1 day before her grand daughter’s birthday) I lost my favorite aunt to cancer. It’s a death that I’m still struggling to cope with. And I know people will poke fun but no fucks given. This song actually had me crying. Kept reminding me of my aunt. But at the same time, I see this song as being very helpful to cancer patients. I can see how it gives them hope and strength to keep fighting. This is why I’m such a big fan of yours. You’re not afraid to tackle sensitive topics that most others won’t touch on. But you do it so articulately and complete fairness. I cried because of my aunt. Despite it, I love this song. Keep up the great work. It’s only a matter of time before you’re at the Grammys. They can only ignore greatness for so long before they are forced to acknowledge it. Keep doing what you do and you will be there sooner than later.  HangoverGang4Life
Found out this morning that my uncle passed away from cancer. So so sad to see him gone. Thank you for this song
Thank you so much my grandma was diagnosed with lung cancer 2 months ago and it’s been hard for me and my family this song raised my hope we need more people like you in this world
I love your music
Its so good it gave me chills and it hits right in the feelings share the hell out if this. My grandfather who was my best friend and someone I could talk to passed from cancer its been years since he's been with us and still to this day I tear up when I think of him
Thank youbruh this song hurt like hell I lost my dad last year to cancer still having a rough go of it 😞
Great song....but is anyone else wondering what is up with the doctor's painted on eyebrows? LOL
My dad died from cancer in 2012 I definitely needed this thanks Tom 💪💪💪 #HOG
How could anyone dislike this? Smh. My aunt died of cancer 3 years ago. She fought as hard as she could, I still miss her everyday. Thank you, Tom! I hope this song gives strength to those suffering, and I pray your illness to be taken away 🙏
I watched the whole thing and didn’t cry probably cause I’m to numb to feel any emotion unless I’m with my girlfriend
Dude you the Man..... Thank you 👍
This has me in tears man. Thank you for all that you are and all that you do.
My father died in 2014 from lung cancer and i took care of him before he passed on to his enternal resting place. Cancer is a nasty demon
Thought this new drop would be an "if I was black" remix with another controversial black artist that would rap about if he was white... The nation needs to come together. Politicians wont do it, they just make shit worse. Still a dope ass song dude, love your music!
Watched my grandma die of cancer when I was 10. :( When will there be a cure?
This song hits home in a way that you could only imagine if you have never experienced it. My mom, my world, my strength was just recently diagnosed with breast cancer and she has tumors spreading through her body. I cant even put into words how scared I am. I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to watch her go through the things shes about to go through. Until I heard this song! Thank you for giving me the courage to be the son that I need to be for her. To everyone out there going through this horrible situation know that your not alone and that  me and thousands of others are right here going through this with you. Hope brings strength and strength is what will lead us to victory in our fight against cancer. God bless you all and God bless you Thomas McDonald.
Thank you Tom, my dad is suffering with bladder cancer right now.
I don't have cancer but at 39 I was diagnosed with MS and told that unfortunately it will kill me soon and the meds are so expensive and both sides of government don't care about us people dying is profitable to the government it's sad really. But I like this tune. Come Check out Our latest album Click here: https://music.indiefy.net/5f29f5e282302e7ab9a7392a We are independent like your are tom.
Damn, I have been avoiding this video in the worst way. RIP mom, even though we hated each other I hope you are no longer in pain.
Love it.  I’m a survivor myself.  This song really makes you stop and think.
I cant even put in words how much you are appreciated this message is so powerful, im not sure if i have cancer yet but i know people who have survived and the radiation and it changed so many things about them.   Money shouldn't be currency positive energy should be and if it was you and everyone else hearing this would be millionaires.
Rip chadwick boseman wakanda forever 🙅🏿
My brother-in-law ( brother to me, he's such a great guy. I have known him my whole life. Married to my sister for almost 40 years ) was just diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. Thank you for this video. I needed this
Just found out yesterday...my 11 year old chocolate lab, Hazelnut has stomach cancer. He only has one to two weeks left to live.
This hit me hard an amazing song!!! RIP PAP
This video is has a great message. Keep up the good work. I have another subject you could press upon....if you want to....and that is the trend of fat acceptance. This is a toxic movement and is a contributor to the high cost of health care almost as much as cancer is. Love ya' Tom!
Very few could of took these words and did this with them . This song very heart felt and deep, also truely motivating during hard times, he really is a versatile musician i can truly relate to this too "the struggle aspect" lyrically he expresses and covers all the major facts and aspects about cancer "other diseases/hardships subliminally" he displays and personifies the struggles complimentented with that strong chorus too "this is fuckin music!!!" great work man Tom goes there when nobody will, facts.  Im 33yr straight white male and i have to admit this one was a tear jerker literally seriously the combination of song and video....its music and medicine.
Song made me cry a little.
damn Tom and Nova.... yall got me crying this morning.  I've been wanting to hear this.... as I sit here with my best friend who has stage 4 copd AND Lung Cancer. shes too weak for treatment..... plus we don't believe in the bullshit treatments anyway.  hugs to all who are fighting.  🤍💜
I can't stop listening to it
I like the song but honestly I don't like the singer 😊
My dad passed away last Halloween. As the one year gets closer the memories get harder to bear. Thank you for this song man. Its like listening to someone who understands.
I lost my mother to cancer, my father has had it twice ( lung and prostate), this one definitely brings tears. Just found out in January 2022  that I too have a blood cancer called CLL
Me and my mom really love this song it's very inspiring
Gracias
I love you
Really we don't have to think about covid for a while
My grandmother had cancer when I was a toddler and thankful it hasn't return this song hits home. Mad respect tom 💯
I just got told last night that one of my cousins who is more like my brother just got diagnosed with cancer. I fell to the ground when I got told that because I don't think I can live with out him and he has a 3 year old who needs his daddy. I can't tell you how many times I played this song when I was told the bad news, thank you again Tom for being such a great artist and even more of an awesome guy much love and respect
I kinda feel like a jackass now. I came here from Ram Ranch [probably because Grant Macdonald made that, so YouTube just throws together all the MacDonalds] and well.. Going from Ram Ranch to y'all with the heartfelt stories about cancer. Anyway, all the best to ya.

Cancer has a cure,they refusing to make it 😔
I love Tom and I had Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and that’s Cancer:)
I don't comment on your videos normally because... well, what's left to say after you. I watch, like than watch Reactions to your videos.  However,  this is the one that hits me the hardest because it's so very close to hm.  When I was thirteen I lost my mom to cervical cancer, one week before Thanksgiving. I only found out that she had cancer that yr, turns out she new she had it 2 yrs before she got pregnant with me... she wasn't supposed to be able to even get pregnant from what the doctors told her. I was her mericle baby. During her pregnancy and for the first few months of my life had been the only time since she was 11 yrs old drug free. She wasn't perfect, but she was my mom and she was great at it for what she was going through.  I am now 35 yrs old and still think of her a lot. My dad, who was also in an addictive state most of the time passed away over 2 yrs ago now oc a heart attack.  He kinda just disappeared from my life after my mom passed... I always felt it was because I had my moms eyes and he had a heard time seeing them. My biological father passed about 7 yrs ago now I think.  I only met him and that side of my family about 10 yrs ago... still not too close. It took FB for them to be able to contact me. Sorry for my brief life story over here, just want others to know their not alone... we all have a story and it's not always a happy one. Thanksgiving is just around the corner... yes, I am thankful for pieces of my life, but, after all these yrs it's still my least favorite holiday, but for my family I'll show to whatever gathering they want me too and bring another pie and an extra can of cranberry. Life goes on rather we want it to or not at times and eventhough we hold our loved ones in our hearts we still have to live... if not for ourselves than for the ones we have left.
Lost my mam to it in urnder 3 weeks when I was 14 hardest ting ever 29 now ❤❤
Cancer took my dad my sister my grandparents on both sides and almost took mom.
This right here! Is the number one hit...Much love and prayers to all who have fought and still fighting. Much love. Hit home for millions. Thank you Tom.
I absolutely love you. You get it ,You are undoubtly the most woke person living today.
Fuck cancer!!!! 💪💪💪 Cannabis saves lives!!!!! That’s the cure!!  Keep on fighting to anyone goin through the toughest battle in life I’ve been through it #teamdoobie
Great song, if your name was Macklemore youd win album of the year he made one song that wasnt nearly as deep effective as this, it only applied to the LGBTQ community, & This is not even on trending anymore lmao, but you'll find a video in the top 100 about some girl making grilled cheese with a hair straightener, that's the problem people are only willing to keep these important topics alive for moments, and that's online; in person, barely anyone will talk about or do anything for these things, and yet they wonder why the world is turning to hell, instead of just liking a comment, like the idea and go out and support it and volunteer.
What made u want to make this song Tom
Ppl that think cure cant be made are stupid :/ its too good buisnes, if they did give us cure buisnes will go down.  Same bout cars run on water and all other sht that you think it cant be done...
Love it! I started out on chemo so strong, that any bodily fluid was toxic, it came under same classification as mustard gas...Yet it did nothing to shrink my tumor, lost my hair, had ulcers all through my digestive tract, I was a nightmare to live with, steroids turned me into psycho bitch from hell. My prognosis wasn't looking good for cancer with no known cure...YET!! went on a trial that was pretty full on, my hair grew back, I felt well to the point of almost forgetting I had the disease invading my body, I am still here and shouldn't be...I just wish the treatment was available to all
Your right Tom ive been telling people for years about the plant down in the amazon rainforest . It can't be synthesized so the company's can't patient it so they cant make money so f humanity they can die. Its the sad reality. Im sorry if you are going thur this currently in life but Ill try to remember the name of the plant if you want to take a trip.
Geez Tom, you just made me bawl me eyes out... you are an AMAZING artist always singing the truth and really touching deep with so many , love you and thank you....❤💙❤💙❤
I've been looking at this since the 90's... my grandmother passed from pancreatic cancer.  @  WATCH & LEARN what Tom was singing about. A WORLD WITHOUT CANCER YouTube
Man I lost my mom 6 days ago to lung cancer. She quit smoking years ago but the damage was already done. She'd fought such a hard battle and this song would make her proud to know someone is spreading the word.
I found out last week I'm in remission, this song has a great meaning and very true. Thank you
Important
I want you to know that I showed your song to someone who has cancer and it meant ALOT to her. Keep it up man, your a straight up angel. This and so many other songs have been so meaningful and powerful to me and others around me.
WOW TOM FOR PRESIDENT <3
Bro I actually during this music video because my brother has cancer
Just got diagnosed last week with skin cancer melanoma. Surgery next week to have a lymph node removed and tested and to remove the skin around the melanoma about the diameter of a baseball. Hoping all is clear.
Hog in action
My grand father died from small cell lung cancer. I still remember the day he died, i went to walk in and he refused to have me and my brother see him at his weakest. I miss him terribly but ive learned that even though he didn't want us to see him he loved us so much and we loved him just the same. I'm a survivor of multiple family suicides and friend suicide but some how tlmy grandfathers death hit me the hardest.
Fuck You Tom....I love you!!!! I hurt!!!:(I lLOVE EVERYONE>>>>I sorry for not being my best...all the money in world!!! I still suck.... bummer right? I love you all.....LOVE
As a soldier it takes a lot to move me. We arent all heartless its just how I protect myself. But this. This got me. Tom I've been a silent observer for a good long time. You helped get me through a lot of overseas tours and rotations but this. This is the best you've ever done. I love your lyrics. Your music. Your messages. This is my favorite over them all. Thank you so much for reminding me how to feel
This songs means a lot. I have lived with leukemia for 8 years now. In 2012 I was diagnosed I was only 13 years of age. Got a 3 year treatment went into remission then relapsed and did a bone marrow transplant. It's fucking hard but you know what I am still blessed I have seen shit in the hospital there's a lot of people in there that would wish to be in my shoes as I have a cure. However it's a trade off. I traded cancer for osteo-necrosis and perosis I need a hip joint replacement on both my hips as almost 50% of the bone is dead so I need a titaniun/ceramic joints depends what they find better and that caused me to take oxycontin, phentolyn, morphine during that time for pain before my transplant I went into ICU due to a strong lung infection they put a strong ventilator on me and told my family pray for him when my family asked them if I would make it. And I was strong enough to pull through. Now I can't play sports live normally. Sadly there is no treatment that doesn't give you something inplace of cancer. But I'm happy to be alive! Currently on methodone because after 3 years of painkillers my body is dependent on them and methodone helps me get off that shit. Whilst pharmaceuticals make plenty of money but I'm blessed to be in a country called Jordan that has a full insurance for me! I didn't have to make my family go broke.
Sometimes you surprise me!  Please keep doing so!
I just lost my grandmother last month to cancer. She battled hardcore for the last 2 years. We shared the same birthday, and she was the nicest person you'd ever meet. I gave the eulogy at her funeral, something I thought I'd never do as just 9 years ago I had such bad anxiety and agoraphobia I wouldn't even leave the house. I still feel her, and I still can't believe she's physically gone. My whole family got a real good look at the medical industry during this time. Some were angels, most were useless, and so many crucial mistakes were made by them that I truly believe had she been under better medical care, she would still be here. If you or someone you know ever has the misfortune of coming down with cancer; do not mess around. Go to the best hospital you can, see the best doctors you can, and use alternative medicine + conventional, not just conventional. Tom, keep doing your thing man. You're one of the best, and Nova is amazing. Power team!
The fact that 2.7k hit thumbs down makes me not to sorry about leaving thos place...wtf is wrong with ppl....if they cant see big pharma will never allow a cure they are out of their minfs
Awesome vid tom this means a lot of me
Too bad so much of this is conspiracy theory bullshit with, of course, zero facts.
I wish you could like something twice.
Found out last week my grandma has breast cancer... we’re hoping it hasn’t spread. 💜
Cancer sucks, I miss my grandpa.
This shit inspirational. Lost someone to this.. keep your shit rolling bro. Dope as fuck!!
The fact that there are people who dislike this song tells us what's wrong with society.
Incredible video Nova, incredible lyrics Tom  Love you guys❤️
I didn't want to listen to this cause I knew it was going to affect me remembering my step dad - but I forced myself cause if I don't feel the pain I will struggle to feel the joys
I fucking love you Tom
😢
Touching
I was having a project with cancer rest house (a place for unlucky family who struggle (economically and socially) with cancer can stay and their kids can get rest and play for days while waiting for therapy or appointment in hospital) the way this music delivering the spirits are exact same as what I feel before when working there.
Thank you Tom ....<<33 this means so much. Thank you. I miss you grandpa <<33
My grand grandmother had cancer  My grandma had cancer and beat it I had cancer and beat it My mom now has cancer 😞
I'm convinced one of the reasons they don't release "the cure" is population control. Along with many other things.
Russialit Twerking Next To Her Mom 😍 https://youtu.be/kuBd33qV6PI
My papa got cancer and beat it but his heart was so weak if he had one more heart attack he would die and the worst thing happened this reminded me of him im going to cry and cry
............... speechless.     Thank you.
Crazy how Larray's Cancelled was only posted two days ago and got 14m while this song only gets 1.2m within 4 days
much love to Tom MacDonald great song
The reason this had me in tears is because I just lost my oldest daughter this last June and even though I have 2 younger daughter's it's a struggle  just to get up in the morning this song reminds me I have to for them
Bless you Mac♥️
Nice Tom.  I've lost 4 so far and we are praying for my mother in law who is fighting this disease.  THANKS MAN!
Amazing video, really hits home, I lost my dad in high school and mom last year, both her parents, and now have virtually no family as a result. Spend many days alone as I have no family and very few friends. Cancer is a horrible medical disease. Thanks for the video and support awareness...
say word man I've been through this cancer thing man 40 years of research 90 billion dollars then came up with a cure so we all just need to holler these doctors ain't no good we know that they can't be trusted and we stayed at home in our bank accounts is busted trying to take care of your loved ones imagine that with all the money that they got out of the trap it is the trap house called the hospital now it's just we need a little some stimulus sometime some real activation all this bullshit for this weird-ass participation give you radiation in a drug called chemo but kills everything even Captain Nemo you know what I'm saying we all underwater trying to breathe easy you know that's impossible soul words believe me cancer cancer God bless the people who have it you take care much love from Fredrick c Warmley
Another Awesome song. Keep spitting Tom.
I love this video so much, thanks tom, you are making a difference
How fkin true, I been saying the same thing for years!
🗣
This aong means alot I have 2 kinds of cancer and there is no cure plus a blood mutation and blood clots organs shutting down always in pain I know pain and cancer is never what anyone wants don't know what to do but this song helps me through it thank you
B17
I love this man, a whole lot of heart and he always teaches something with his facts in his songs.
The best medicine is the truth. Awesome video tom!!! I don't care if the message is " sensitive " some things need to be openly talked about....this is something that will effect every single one of us at some time in our life's . Keep doing what you do, I'll be here doing what I can .
They DO have a cure!! The government will not allow it to be released. Question? How many Presidents have died of cancer? NONE!! Don't trust the government and the drug companies
Omg my whole side of my late mom's had breast cancer .. sucks but this video touched in so many things n I love how he talked about the insurance n not being able to pay .. Tom ur a genius I cry every time I watch this n I didn't forget Nova she's killing it as well n I also love all her music    mi yard n 1990s n problems .. ppl shud check that out she's good actually I'm guna watch sum of them now Love u guys HOG 4life 🤘💋🤘💋🤘💋
You’ve done it again Tom 😎 much love brother
This is a guest but I feel this could be inspired by someone in Toms life. Whether a fan or someone close to him. There are some things that can't be faked...
This video shows Toms connection to this. This video is hard...
My mom held on until the end. She even asked if she was dying. It was tough to hear. Yep gone.
I just found out in the last week I might have lung cancer I have a lesion on my right lung but other things make them think it's cancer I've lost 75 pounds in the last 6 months I've been blacking out they don't know if it's from malnutrition or something else I'm 41 and will say I'm scared like a little kid I don't have any friends and all the family I got is me my mom,dad and grandma I don't want to put them through this so alot of thoughts have been crashing down on me I don't know if I can beat the battle this time
What a powerful song Tom... THANK YOU
My dad just beat it. I felt everything in this song. Tom, I know you’ll never read this, but you make me proud to be Hang Over Gang. You speak the truth. It’s healing. No one else is doing that. God bless you and Nova. I gotta go. Gonna call my dad.
I lost my father 3 years ago to cancer. He fought. Losing him was the hardest thing I've ever gone through. Watching his last breathe crushed me. You always do songs that tug at the strings of my heart. I'm not sure to thank you or be mad for the feels.
My mother beat stage 3 breast cancer and my father passed from cancer and organ failure overall. It’s not always easy and was hard taking care of both. My father had a stroke after removing such during surgery resulting in 95% brain loss and he never functioned again. Lost 200 pounds and didn’t remember me but everyone older for the last year of his life. My mother beat it like a warrior but developed horrible multiple lung diseases as well. I was in St. Jude for a couple weeks myself due to a rare kidney disease (DMH) growing up seeing children come and go. My two grandparents I have left are pretty much there but always staying positive and having hope that I have a lot of time myself. This means a ton to a lot of people and thank you for this song. 💙
Anyone else feel like tom is the one voice that will always speak out for everyone. No matter what or who
a friend of mine since high school is in the middle of the battle right now. I wish I could upload a photo for you. I sent her the song right when it was released. She said she cried like a baby and found it incredibly inspirational. Thanks Tom
Over lock down I got a rare blood cancer ... Thought I had gastro but ended up with cancer and ulsers 😟 I will try to be stronge and be a  fighter! Your life flashes before you . Live to the fullest  ✌️Piece ❤️ love 😁 happiness
Hey Tom, thank you for being you i lost my dad two days to lung cancer.. this hit different.. thank you for being the voice he lost ✊ Hang Over 4 Life
Tom,you are The #1 musician !!!You hit this right in the heart.I feel like I all ready know you!Don't change and never Quit!!;)we love you!Natasha Sanders&family
"No one wants to leave here you can tell"  Its true. I'm on the edge but I'm afraid to leave. I'm 13 with abusive parents. I get bullied and harrassed at school. Even online is a nightmare. This man is the only thing keeping me going since my dogs passed
I wish this song would of come out years and years ago. I would of showed my dad this but sadly I can't 😢 my dad died April 1st 2011 of brain and lung cancer. I was only 17 at the time, not yet 18. I was home that day when my world was flipped upside down and witnessed the EMTs trying to revive him (he came back long enough to tell my mom he loved her) them wheeling his body out to the coroner's vehicle. I will never forget my best friend thinking I was joking when I told her. I wasn't joking about it. I was truly hurt and upset that I no longer would have my father to see everyday. I still can't get over him being gone. 😢 I love you dad and I miss you everyday ❤️😢
I needed this... On December 1st it'll be 5 years since my mother passed from cancer. She marched this Earth for over a year with only half a lung, and a chunk of her brain missing. She went on radiation treatments for liver cancer, and was gone in less than 3 months. Her birthday was in September, her favorite holiday is Halloween, and 1964's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer was one of her favorite movies. So this "most wonderful time of the year" is far from that for me. But I needed this song.. Thank you Tom 💚
my best friends dad is going through radiation for lung cancer. tom you couldnt have dropped this at a better time. this will be played as loud as possible at his benefit we are suprising him with this weekened!
I feel ya G. My dad passed from Stomace Cancer. Here if anyone wants to talk.
Bro, you are doing Gods work. Keep spreading these eye opening and motivating videos.
Cancer is next worse thing to having listened to this literally tone deaf song
My grandma beat stage 3 breast cancer back in 2012 and it was amazing, but she just recently got diagnosed cancer for the second time and has a 4 inch tumor in her breast. She’s an amazing woman
its true man. I believe they got a cure for it but the price is so grand we ommon fokes can't pay it. And if they let it out than they could make as much money off it.
Love it!  What a great song👍👍👍❤️❤️
Increase it touched my heart ❤️
Yeah I'll most likely die 20 cause all males in my family die from cancer
peppa pig english episodes
My wife died from liver cancer. Good video tom. Def got me crying though.
If you would've shaved your head instead of making me watch some hot chick do it,, would've been fire man
This should be bigger than it is.
I just wanted to tell you how much I love your music. I love how real you are in everything you say. This song spoke to me personally because 2 weeks before my 19th birthday (I'm 38 now) , I was diagnosed with cancer. I have PTSD from the experience so your video was incredibly difficult for me to watch, but it was so accurate and the song mirrored so many of the thoughts I had during and have had since. I have been in remission since January 2002, but I am still dealing with the side affects of the "treatments". I'm grateful to be here, don't get me wrong, but so many people are unaware of just how the treatments can affect you the rest of your life if you survive. I'm grateful, though, I now have 3 children,a husband, and a beautifully odd life. lol. I just wanted to let you know how much your music means to me. thank you so much for making it.
My uncle died from cancer and every day I wish I would I have known him better 😔 i miss you uncle Charle 😢 there's not a day that I don't think of you 😭😥
is itbad that i didnt cry
My grandfather on my step dad's side developed skin cancer and it started spreading. I have so many good memories of him. How he would give me his Elvis Presley merchandise because he knew I loved elvis, he would joke around with me and my sisters, he even stood in the corner with me when I was in timeout so I didn't feel alone and embarrased. My last memory of him was when I saw him in the hospital. He was very thin and grey, couldn't speak because he had feeding tubes. My step dad told him I was learning guitar (which was a passion of my grandfathers) and he started doing air guitar and nodding his head. I'm glad I was able to make him proud of me and happy before he left this cruel world. He passed away a week later. He inspired me to continue my art and so much more.
I absolutely feel this song. I've loved lost and had my own battles and happening now battles with cancer. What a great song. I fight everyday working my coworkers see me struggle but with a smile and positivity because I know I have today. My kids are also A Huge Light in my life for without them I wouldn't feel like there was anything worth fighting that hard for. Xoxo to those who struggle with or know someone with this disease.
Thank you so much for this one.
7 funerals in 8 years. In coal country... not 1 family member has made it past 60 and what kids I grew up with who didn't die from drugs have died from cancer of their own. The poor town that nobody cares about, a power plant that dumps into the river because it's cheaper to pay a fine if caught then do the right thing. The last aunt to die passed a week before Christmas after refusing to go through radiation because it hadn't worked for anyone else in the family and she'd rather be able to hung her grandbabies goodbye than to be too sick and out of her mind to know her own name like her husband who had died 3 years before her.  Our politicians and our corporations are poisoning the world we live in. We spend our entire lives paying into a system for a check we'll never be able to cash because we'll be dead from disease before we can ever retire.
❤️
He has potential but he is too goddam mopey  as hell it's like get over yourself and rap bro just be you stop feeling sorry for yourself on every video and song bro you could be great just not over what you cry about or pretend too just be you bro goodluck and hope you do and hope you can be on a label one day since your on youtube that's tells me no one sign you yet or you wouldnt be in youtube
Lost my dad to cancer stage 4
Family has been hit a few times by this bastard of a disease. Never thought a musician would produce the help. Really glad I was wong. Thank you.
Man tom you are a great guy.It is amazing to see you care so deeply.It is sad  to see people dislike this song. LOVE you tom keep doing what you doing.LOVE
Hey brotha I hope you see my comment. This song means the world to my dad and I. One of my youngest sisters was diagnosed with leukemia two months before she turned 2. It really messed up my dad and I, luckily she beat in just two years. She is now 7 and she is such a happy child.   I love your music man been a big fan for about three years now. Thank you, for putting out such great real music. And specifically this song here, like I previously said for my ad and I it hit home. So thank you man. I can't express how much I love this song it's easily going down in history as my all time favorite ever.
some incredibly powerful lyrics. the song just keeps peeling back like a onion, im not crying... YOUR crying..
Fuck that cbds are awesome
POPULATION CONTROL
I feel compelled to leave a comment with my experience. Both of my parents died of cancer. My mother developed breast cancer when I was 4 or 5. She had a double mastectomy, but her cancer returned with a vengeance in her spine when I was in 7th grade.   She was the fighter.  When I was 15, shortly after my brother died of an overdose when he was 17, my father developed colon cancer. It metastasized to his liver. The oncologists were optimistic about surgery to remove the tumors in his liver, so they opted for surgery. Upon opening him up for surgery, the doctors found many more tumors than they anticipated. They determined surgery wasn’t worth it.  He stopped fighting.  My father was the first to die. It was December 8th, 2006. It was less than 2 years after my brother’s overdose.   As for my mother: they tried every available medication that they could. For years they would try new drugs and would say to her “this might be the one.” As a nurse, she was skeptical that any of them would be “the one,” but she survived as long as she could. She said it was for me. She didn’t want me to be alone.  My mother survived until January 6th, 2011.   I tell this story not for sympathy, but only for this: I’m so relieved that all of them died before this absolute shit dick of a song ever existed. I absolutely envy them.  Fuck you.
🙏
The first time I listen to this I cried for half an hour 😭😭😭
Kenya , African people love you Tom Macdonald
YOU ARE A HERO TO ME YOU DONT KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE YOUR STANDING UP FOR RIGHT NOW ROCK ON TOM MACDONALD DONT NEVER LET THEM BUY YOU
I like the fact you make relevant substance filled music. I lost my gpa that raised me to lung cancer. I watched him take his last breath but he fought so hard. Bless anyone reading this and know you will prevail and the mind is such a strong organ.
@tom macdonald that one hit hard man. I just lost a loved one to cancer two weeks ago. Thanks, love all of your music.
Really think about it. If we cured and fixed everything we could, we would hit a population so ridiculous that we wouldn’t be able to even feed ourselves. It’s a dark possible truth, but also a dark possibile necessity. At this point there would be incredible wars, and more death and darkness for our species than we could even imagine. Maybe the government really is doing population control, but maybe it’s to keep our species alive. Someone has to kill the cow so the rest can eat.
This song is so deep it takes a lot to make me or my mom to tear up but we couldn't hold  back since my grandmother and. Other family members have had cancer so it's a really touchy subject and love the way he showed it ❤❤
Thank you for this. I lost my Dad to cancer 4 years ago to Bone Cancer. It was so painful, watching him go through that. Your right, there is a cure but there's more money, in all the medication you have to take to fight it. There is a special place in Hell for Big Pharma. God bless you homie. Every word rings true.H.O.G 4 EVER.
Never stop making music Tom, what you do truly impacts thousands. Incredible song my friend
cancer killed my mom and my dad. and i miss them every second of everyday. i was 11 when my dad was took away and 20 when my mom was took away from cancer, my heart is still filled with sorrow from this... but this song makes me strong... thank you tom. really. thank you.
Wow bro❤️🔥

You always take the shit in life & make it even realer 🤩🥰 Your AWESOME & I can't wait to hear what you address next 🤪 !!!!
Great song!
Thanksgiving day 1997 My mother lost her 3rd bout with cancer.  She was in the hospice waiting for the end.  WE cried for 6 months as we watched her suffer and fade.  Go ahead and cry.   It is ok.  The day she died and to this day on thanksgiving I thank God she no longer suffers  . I miss you mom.  And yes I cry when I hear this song.   She went thru chemo/radiation with her second bout. ( uterine cancer)  the doctors asked her to do that again .  She asked them : "Will it kill this cancer"  They said no. you might live a day or two longer.  Her reply was  no I have no wish to live a day or two longer to sick to live."  I miss you mom.  She called me the September before she died.   She said she was feeling better and was going to get a newspaper a nd find her a place to live.  I heard a voice in my ear telling me She was going home Thanksgiving day.  My daughter and I waited by the phone for the call. It came.  Mom had gotten a day pass to have thanksgiving with my sister.  She died in her sleep.  Stay strong, keep fighting, go ahead a cry. It is ok.
My gpa died 20 years ago any we still haven't figured it out.. it was the first crushing pain of my life and I've had others to match it that weren't cancer but still I hurt because why aren't we putting more into a solution.count me as one of the tears this video shed. Tom you are gold and if not the world I atleast needed you to see shit better.
I'm okay with dying.  I'd gladly take cancer for Matt's brother. For my dads mom that I never met.   I am gonna die one day. Every day I could die. Let me take someone's death who wasn't just.
Very excellent dude. So very good of you.Lost my mother to lung cancer in 04, only 51.😔
Im fighting CML, 3yrs, in my mind i can kill my doctor, cause i know he knows that there is way! It's confronting.... Faaackkk, ❤️ thnx for this!!! Shiii i love u man 🙏❤️❤️❤️
This video should be seen by everyone in the world... thank you tom and nova for making this amazing video!!!!
I just found out I had cancer a few months ago nobody wants my insurance so I'm suffering. I love this song it made me cry.
Vote Trump then medicines are going to pour in, for all kinds of stuff.
I cried so much because my friend has cancer 😭your my favorite rapper you only state the truth 😢
Human testing for Crispr started last year, we’ve already cured a woman with sickle cell this year. In 10 years guaranteed cancer will be eradicated.
Last year I realized that my lymph nodes had been swollen for awhile, without being sick. Made a doctor appointment and eventually got 2 CT scans. Found that I have multiple enlarged nodes in my lungs and my lymph nodes on my neck are still enlarged today. I never got any  diagnosis and I don't really worry about it but I had to stop making appointments for it because its to much money, either I have to spend a bunch of money on nothing or I spend a bunch for something that'll cost even more money that I don't have.
This made me sooo sad yo but it is a good song!!
T  O  M  <3
Another great video and message. I have lost family to cancer, beat cancer and still want to see the day we defeat this horrible disease. I have the same belief about it, it is a big industry and investors get paid for the medicine the victims buy.. Sadly the pain we face when facing this disease leaves many with heavy emotional scars. God bless you Tom. I needed to hear this.
https://youtu.be/ddijh-Hi_R4
Smart move. He’s using the Eminem way, have diss tracks and aggressive tracks. Then get real. Smart game plan. Especially as a Indy artist
Some people devoted their lives to finding a cure for this most insidious of sicknesses. And I doubt they love it when they are blamed for "hiding a cure", "doing it for the money" and so on. Anyway, every Tom's song is great but this one is absolutely mind blowing.
And corny rapper award goes to...
Man this hit hard 😪 I lost my son to cancer 5 years ago
In some shots
Nothing needs said. You know what you’re doing. You know you have a voice that needs heard. You know, You’ve changed lives.
Thank you tom
Song hits home, lost my dad 4 years ago to lung cancer. Miss ya pops
Why do so many people hate truth....  Tom speaks truth and u just don’t wanna accept it
about the dislikes >:( ?
My grandmother is battling 3rd stage cancer she is strong and hopefully she pulls through
this is complete trash and tom give up you are old already
No lie, I teared up a bit watching this.
I actually recently lost my boyfriend to Cancer. He fought for 5 years, but it's okay.. I'm just glad his suffering is over, we miss him, but everything is okay.. Or so I keep telling myself.
Thankyou!!!! I'm fighting and this helps!
Damn I started crying for real hits home bro thank you
My dad developed stage four brain cancer when i was 11. I remember the family in the living room trying to figure out how to pay for his medicine. I brought him my piggybank and told him to take it all. I wish so bad i couldve saved him. I miss him so much.
Amen Brother!
Thank you for this Tom... And I'm sorry for whoever you lost... You can see it all over your face.
Did anyone else cry while watching this?
Hits home.😢
Ok Tom you got a couple tears from me.
Shoot, I promised myself I would'nt cry...
Interesting perspective
Powerful song!!Nothing but tears running down my eyes. Mom passed in February of uterine cancer. Im a papillary thyriod cancer survivor since 2015. This song hits me so deep. Thank you for making such a powerful song. Keep giving us all these amazing videos. We are so proud of you Tom!!
Warning don’t read comments- will have to shed a gangsta tear.
Your the best tom keep up the good work! This made me cry because my friend had cancer and he passed away during his sleep... 😔
Deep bro
So goo
I have had six close family deaths from cancer in the past 9 years im only 16 cancer fucking sucks it takes someone from the strongest person you have even know to about nothing and it is the WORSE feeling to know that you cant help one of the deaths where my aunt chris she was 86 years old and she was the strongest person i have ever met she was diagnosed and came how to see me and did not sit down and give in we went to do yard work less the half an hour later she was one of the first female foreman's of a cigarette factory in the us at the time she worked there for over 40 years she live thought the great depression she watched all 4 of her siblings die and still fought right tell the end when at about 5:40 am on may 19 2015 she held my grandmothers hand and told her that she was going to look out for us and that she was ready i was 11 i woke up that day to tell the woman that raised me and my best friend bye and that i love her i it with her till the coroner came to get her i will always remember the second she left the house in a body bag like nothing the world is fucked and i hope no one ever has to deal with death as i have and to anyone suffering from cancer or fro the effects of a family member having it you have my most sincere apologies and i hope you make it though it or that you can come to see that there no longer suffering
Found this song sitting in the infusion room getting my chemo for colon cancer. Truly gave me strength  thank you.
Sunday my mom passed away from Cancer... That was the day we were all store to do a window visit. Love you mom.
I dont know why it feels so cheesy even though the subject is very intense
Thank you Tom that song is beautiful
Man it’s tough my dad got diagnosed back in January after not being able to use the bathroom. They found a blockage in his colon and it would up being cancer. He’s been going to chemo every other week and it’s been so hard on everyone. I try to keep hope and be there for him but I find myself emotional a lot nowadays. It’s hard to watch such a strong and hard working man get so weak. I believe in prayer and to anyone else that does, please say a prayer for my dad and the family. He’s my best friend and it would be so difficult if he passed. I hope everyone that is going through the same thing with a family member or yourself finds relief in some form. 🙏 give it your best fight. Never give up
My best friend died 10 years ago  from cancer at the age off 21 leaven behing a daughter just before her 1st birthday and only a week away from Christmas. It never gets easier. He only asked me one thing to do. Be there to protect his daughter. I have her every other weekend. We spend the day together every anniversary. She wants to do the one thing her dad loved. We are going carp fishing to France for a week. Be the 10 year this year. Going to be a hard one Tom Macdonald you speak for use all. Hands down your nuts but in the right way. Time for a tour please.
I’m touched 😔😔
The only song I can't listen to at work.. the tears flow on this one bro. You're a true legend of our time. Of all fucking time!
Tom BurgerKing should collab with this guy. End the war.
This is so deep and may it truly helps everyone, may god bless you and guide you allthrough your life, give us whatever you have its the best for all, 💎
This G is as genius
The song is sad I almost cried
My mom has stage 4 lung cancer. She hides it from me but I know the outcome. She never tells me what they tell her.
What a great song, it's nice to hear something new that actually has meaning
Strongest line imho: We are all just dying to live.  Damn man you couldn't have put it any better. It's so hard not to be around things that are bad for us just to start not to mention our own genes.
This is what the doctors need to take
I'm not used to the realism in your channel because I'm so used to you laughing and dissing others but this isn't that
3 years ago on December 10th, 2017 at 7:53 AM, my grandmother lost her battle with cancer. She had lung cancer that had spread to multiple other organs. Some of my family believes shes known for a while because we found out she was hiding it from us in May that same year. The doctors said she would only live for 3 more months at the most. She lived for 7 months after that. The day before it happened, she chose to be home (which was and still is my house) for when it happened, because even she knew that she didn't have much longer to live. She went out with my aunt Ryan for her last smoke before telling me the last thing i will ever hear from her... "I love you all, I'm sorry for being such a burden." That night, we all stayed up waiting, none of us could sleep until very late. I fell asleep around 5AM on the floor out of pure exhaustion. I was woken up at about 7:55 and told that she had died just two minutes prior. I woke up my cousin who was sound asleep in my bed and told him what had happened. Being 17, I still didn't show any emotion until I saw her. I saw her laying in the brand new hospital bed that they had set up in her room to replace her bed. About 20 minutes after she was bagged up and rolled out of the house, my aunt Ryan and uncle Corey had told us about what had happened. My aunt Ryan caught herself falling asleep so she went to get Corey to trade shifts. By the time Corey walked in, she was gone. We believe she fought until no one was looking just so none of us had to witness it, but for me, seeing her lying down, not moving or breathing as she was doing prior to the incident, was enough for me to have a mental breakdown. About an hour later, i called my boss and told her that i wasnt going to be in because of what happened. she said it was ok and that i could take as much time as i needed (even though my job had a 3 day grieving policy which is basically 3 paid days off).
:'-(
Thank you so much for this
I'm 44 and I find out next month if I have lung cancer or not! Praying I don't!!! I have already lost my papa from lung cancer and a uncle to brain cancer
I don’t know what it’s like to have cancer but my grandfather just past away from cancer in 2018 :( he died of stage 4 brain cancer :( this video made me smile and cry out pure happiness :( thank you Tom you mean so much to me you have no idea :( and everyone else you’ve inspired :( we love you dude
My friend is going through chemo for the second time in November and I can't imagine them not being able to make it through again, this song is a reminder of his fight
Great song stay strong everyone
Wow!! Well said TM! I watched my dad fight two cancers at once and he truly was the toughest man I have ever seen. I had no idea of his amazing strength growing up. It was a great honor to sit by his side his last 30 days as he never complained but continued to fight and love God and people till his final breath.  Thanks again Tom, I will think of the great man I called father every time I hear this song.!!
I just lost my adopted sister to stage 4 colon cancer at the beginning of this month. She just turned 35. She was a fighter for sure. Thank you for this song.
I'm a cancer survivor so this song definitely hits harder 💕 I've been in remission for 16 years 😊 I'm now 21 and very lucky to have my two kiddos. I got diagnosed when I was 3.
Just incredible. Legendary Tom, Keep Him Safe At All Costs.
honestly this dude is so trash now lmao he had that good song like everybody hates me or whatever its called bu thist shit sounds so generic haha my boi tryna get on them radio waves
This hit me hard rip grandma😔🙏
Been loving you music for a few years. I'm a cancer survivor myself and this hits home. Love you Tom. Keep being awesome.
Love this sm, lost my dad 2 years to liver cancer, hardest thing I’ve ever gone through
Thank you for touching our hearts Tom. Thank you for giving those fighting this ugly beast an inspiring anthem.
F cancer.
Lost all 4 grandparents two cancer... Good song Tom always fight my friends :) Never Give Up i pray for all
Tom said it. Money is in the treatment not the cure.
As a survivor of stage 4 cancer and a current fighter of cancer this is correct. They are sabotaging their own treatments by giving micro doses of chemotherapy so they don't  work on most patients
I was diagnosed with colon cancer last February.    I'm using nutrition and full extract cannabis oil.  I'm 61 on election day.  I want quality of life.   Not death by pharma.
Is the doctor the same guy from the white boy vid?
"The good might go to heaven and the bad might go to hell, but no one wants to leave here you can tell".   That line got to me idk why. Caught me off guard and got my eyes teary..
Very sad and true. I have a younger friend, he’s only 19 his best friend/girl found out she has stage 4 breast cancer, she’s only 19 and she just started college and had to leave because her back hurt, she went to the doctor and found out stage 4 breast cancer spread all over her body. I found all of this out the very day this video dropped. You can’t say that’s a coincidence. Should I send my friend this video or will this just make them sadder? It’s a very sad situation and my heart breaks for this poor kid.
Second time I'm watching this and I'm still crying
Thank you so much for this video 😢😢 i just lost my mom in July due to cancer and didn't get to say goodbye so still super hard
Another awesome song from a very talented man. Way to go tom
Damn Tom...I just woke up bro
amazing video bro, my mom has cancer and i teared up listing to this
My dad is battling leukemia right now,hard days and ling nights.im his only child,this is hard but itll b harder to lose my best friend
IT COMES FROM YOUR GUT!!!!! AMERICA HAS OVER 350,000 GMO, and some Natural, Parasites that Crawl through your intestines to the organ of choice and Leave tails and actually nematodes are little frkn lizards Inside. Jesus was telling Us this! Listen to The Essene Gospel of Peace.....And Do It!! It's in The Gut and He was curing Peoples ailments. Raw meat turns INTO maggots!! Where does it come from IYO? People this is TRUTH.
I lost my mom and grandmother now if have polyposis my daughter as well....sigh the clock is ticking! GREAT VIDEO TOM MACDONALD DALUTE FROM TORONTO CANADA 🙏💪✌️🇨🇦
YOU NAILED IT WITH FOOD AND ALL THAT YOU SAY. GOD LOVE.
Damn good song brother
They have the cures.
We lost my Mum to cancer shortly after I was born. That was 40 years ago.  The sad part for me, is that my Father is still SO angry with God for taking her.
I had been avoiding listening to this. My sister passed may 2017 at 43. She was my best friend.  I had been four years clean from heroin and pills,  I dripped morphine in her mouth as she layed dying in my family's living room.  I didn't use but picked up the bottle. My ptsd symptoms ramped up. This spring I called our biological father who had sexually and mentally abused us. It sunk me further and I attempted suicide.  I got my shit together but still felt empty. I don't know how I stumbled upon you but your music has changed something inside me.  I've started writing again, finally got off all the medication that was keeping me numb, clearly not numb enough.  I feel like myself for the first time in almost twenty years. Your four albums are the first I've bought since Napster 😆 I had to buy a new sound system to go with
Verse 1] Everybody knows someone who's sick Forty percent will get cancer, only half's gonna live Your mom and your dad and your sister stand inside a room And someone won't survive it, do you hope it isn't you? I swear that cancer has a cure, but they're refusing to make it They've done like forty years of research, ninety billion in donations We've been running for the cure and wearing ribbons for ages Why are people still going through radiation? It's fucking crazy Hundred billion-dollar industry, they can't afford to end it And nobody wants to die, our only option is to spend it We give anything to stick around for just another second Give a fortune to the doctors who promise they can extend it The profits are astronomic, the hospital and the clinics Of fillings coffins with dollars, it's awful, let's just admit it We're all human, we'll keep fighting 'cause it's how we survive But it's scary 'cause we don't know where we'll go when we die  [Chorus] Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart Chorus] Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart  [Verse 2] Nothing matters if you don't have your health All the money in the world doesn't help The good might go to Heaven and the bad might go to Hell But no one wants to leave here, you can tell And cancer touches everyone, it's in our genetics And our world's become so toxic, it's all carcinogenic We've polluted the water, the air; the food we're ingesting Is full of hormones and poison, our population's infected They sell us cigarettes and liquor, built a business on addictions We've been paying them to kill ourselves, we're dying to keep living It's the system, it's a prison, we keep trying to beat it We get cancer from keeping all of our demons a secret And our insurance don't cover the things we need to defeat it And even if it does, then we might die from the treatment Our best defence is living like we do not know what cancer is Fight it if you have it and pray that there's something after this Chorus] Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart  [Bridge] You won't know how to be brave Till you choose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength Till you struggle to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith Till you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take Till you realize you didn't break  [Chorus] Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart
My grandpa died 10 years ago from cancer. My family wouldnt let me go see him because he couldn't remember anything or anyone. My grandpa was my best friend and I miss him everyday. Thank you for this Tom.
It took me a min to watch this for personal reasons. Beautiful painful and truthful!  Thank you much love Keep rising
Louis Hayes.. Tom's song made me think of you. You've been gone for so long.. and taken way too young. You were always a ray of sunshine in class. No matter what you went through, losing your hair, kids being assholes (though we always stepped up and defended you) you always had a smile on your face and sang your heart out in chorus.. the day we learned you had left us was awful.. only in 6th grade and your light was snuffed out.. our teacher asked us if we wanted to drop out of the competition considering the loss, a couple of us stood up and said No, Louis would want us to go on. And you know what, we WON that competition and brought home that "Superior" Trophy in your name. We knew you would be so proud.   You are not forgotten Louis, you are still in our hearts ❤️❤️
My grandpa passed one month ago from cancer after surviving the first time about three years ago. I needed this
Seek The Most High God through Jesus Christ♥️ We all will leave this earth at some point!
God damn that's powerful man! When my brother Tony passed 20 years ago was the only living AIDS patient who had successfully gotten rid of the KS lesions through chemo but unfortunately one month later he left us BECAUSE of the damage left from the chemo Tom McDonald thank you for writing this song  ALWAYS in loving memory of my brotha Anthony Wayne England 7/21/1967- 3/21/2000
Dude that makes me laugh like a maniac just made me cry like a bitch.
My girlfriend was diagnosed with cancer, lost a boob, it’s been 2 years. We’re still together and stronger than ever. I hear many people split but she’s just awesome and supportive I can’t let that go!
This song hit home hard. Lost my dad to colon cancer and my mother in law from lung cancer. My heart goes out to anyone who is dealing with this personally or someone in their family. Wish my dad would of had a chance to hear this. Thank you Tom and Nova.
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
It is DISGUSTING that corporate America puts a dollar above a human life!  We need to stop this and refuse to be their guinea pigs and lab rats any longer!!!  There’s a cure, it’s time they let it be known!!
Wow hits hard big up Tom
My wife was diagnosed two years ago on sept 19th while we were celebrating my sons birthday at a bowling alley. We had state medical at the time and they were planning a surgery for her but had to do blood tests before because she has a-plastic anemia. We lost our coverage shortly after because I made barely too much off of a single check one pay period. Now we’ve been stuck without coverage because I can’t afford basic coverage anymore and the state/local healthcare won’t take us back. I’ve been striving to qualify for better positions so I can earn enough or get care for her. We’ve made appointments and more often than not we get canceled or rescheduled. This system makes me sick.
This song hits so hard. I work in healthcare and watching people with cancer struggle not only with just that but other medical issues that get amplified through chemo and just having cancer in general is devastating.
I lost my mom to cancer back in 1996. I miss her every day. Cancer is a nasty disease. When my mom was getting her chemo treatments, she would have good days and bad days. It broke my heart when she was having her bad days and when she passed away. I really hope that one day they find a cure for cancer. Great track Tom.
Damn dude.
🥰
This hit way to deep ive been watching my best friend suffer wit leukemia for a lil under a year and this means more than words can explain THANK YOU TOM U GIVE ME HOPE. keep being u
You never fail to give me chills everytime you sing/rap!
How the hell did this even get 100 dislikes. I'm not a rap fan but any music that moves the heart is true. And this moves my soul and my heart. You both are amazing. Thank you for sharing your gifts.   My uncle died of cancer, his last words to his wife, 3 days before he died....   Honey! I'm going to be going on an incredible journey. I know you can't come with me but I'm so excited! I love you and I'll miss you, but we'll be together soon.  My aunt died a few years later. Also of cancer. She went quickly. They're together now. On a most incredible journey.
I have no idea if they have beef im not aware of but can tom do a track with either eminem or mgk? Either would be epic af.
Damn tom this hit hard;I lost my step mom in 2012 from breast cancer and it kills me that she never got to see me turn my life around from the dark path I was going down,get married and have a wonderful son that will never get to meet the wonderful loving woman she was.
Watched my dad, mother in law and uncle go through this battle and they all lost after months. Was the worst 6 months of me and my familes life, one right after the other. Thank you tom for making this.
I have made my peace with cancer and I am ready to rest now 😌  Love this and I pray for everyone going through this 🙏 I love you all and God bless ❤
Just diagnosed last year. This means alot to me! Thanks man!
Dr royal m rife found a cure almost 100 years ago
Great song Tom McDonald thank you. My father has a tumor on his kidney right now and with covid it is taking a lot long to get it removed and it is growing so I hope after 4 months it hasn't spread anywhere else. Keep up the great music it means a lot to your fans.
Prayers for you Tom. Love you man. I would love to see you marry your girl one day. Keep up the good work! ❤️
😭😭😭😭 my nana died in front of me to cancer
TOM ❤️ this is an incredible video absolutely Beautiful it captures the pure essence of the message you’re trying to send ❤️
Thanks for making me cry at 8 in the morning. Seriously, thank you.
My best friend died to stage 4 cancer this year. It was the hardest thing I've endured watching the life drain from him. Never forgotten. Thank you Tom..
This is what world need to see this is the reality 🙏🏻
Thank you for making this video hun!  I am just one of the fighters you speak of.  I have been battling breast cancer for 2 and a half years now.  I have ZERO genetic markers for any type of cancer.  I had them check everything! My cancer is triple negative and the most aggressive type of breast cancer with a higher recurrence odds. I have gone through 27 rounds of chemo which had horrible side effects with my brain especially my memory (More on that in a minute). It also has destroyed my joints and I am in constant pain.  But I keep fighting!  I had 22 rounds of radiation which burned me so horribly that when my husband forced me to go to the hospital because he was so scared that the burns were getting infected, the nurses were horrified and one even cried when I showed her.  I also had to have surgery and they removed the surrounding tissue where the tumors were.  I say were, because by the time I was scheduled for surgery, the tumors were gone!  I had scans two weeks ago and the Drs. at the hospital said they found "Suspicious Tissue" where the cancer was.  My oncologist however said she's not worried and thinks it's just malformed tissue from the treatments and surgery.  She said and I quote "Those doctors are just not used to cancer being CURED!!" I'm praying she is right, but my appointment for further tests isn't until next month so I have to wait and stress over the what ifs.  In the meantime, I have, since being diagnosed with cancer started to follow my dream.  I have started an online business teaching students in the US and UK how to read tarot professionally.  I am getting ready to launch two new online courses that will be hopefully ready to launch on Nov. 5th! I have struggled with my own learning of tarot because of the damage to my memory that chemo did, but I thank god every day that he chose to test me in this way because of cancer and my memory issues, I created my own way of "Memorising" the meanings of the tarot cards and have taught a small group of people with astonishing results for them and that is what my courses teach.  My memory system and I will continue to fight to allow people to see that cancer even though it's a devastating and traumatic disease, it doesn't have to stop your life.  You can still live, love, grow, and help others along the way.  Keep spreading your message of hope, faith, and strength.  It is so truly needed by people like myself.
Love you Tom, keep the faith and stay the course. Keeping being you my dude.
💦🙏🌱
My grandma 😔
Good for you bro
Man I needed this song. My step mom is battling stage 3 Lung Cancer. And its tough as fuck.
THERE AINT NO ONE THAT TOM WONT CALL OUT 😈🔥🔥👌👍💖😱
Great song. i watched my dad fight it as long as he could. he passed 4 days after he turned 60 and 6 mounths to the day that my baby girl was born. keep up good work love hearing your music
DR ROBERT MORSE, DR SEBI! SIMPLE!!!!!!!
Tom MacDonald This song is so amazing I was listening to it this morning when I got to work to find out my uncle lost his battle with cancer this morning it has destroyed my family one person at a time for 6 years straight it is the Devil 😢 you are awesome and appreciate what you do alot Respect
Don't come for me...... but elderberries have cancer fighting bodies....a naturally grown berry that grows wild. It attacks viruses at their core. If you have a family member with cancer, get them some elderberry syrup or at least do some research on them. Oh and the berries kick covid 19's butt🤘❤💪💪
Thank you for being here Tom. Thanks for doing all that you do.
This hit me. I love It ❤
Damned if I haven't been saying this to people for years. Charities seem to be more like businesses. Great song, keep up the great work 👏👌
Forget my dad died from cancer when i was 1. Until i read the comments.
Bro good message
Probably the most honest musician out there.
I didnt know my great grandfather but I believe after his service he was diagnosed with cancer and passed away within about 2 years or so, my great grandma followed shortly after about 2-3 months, I sometimes wonder what they'd be like, Tho I haven't experienced personally how bad it must be and how it has a horrible effect on people, You are all strong and you can get through it, you might have moments of doubt but at the end of the day you got this
Tom,  I got a guardian angel last week in my Uncle Rodger and my grandmother died of cancer on St Patricks Day. I don't know but I hope the research they learned from Mid, my grandmother,  helped Rodger have a smoother transition to Heaven. I love the passion and vulnerability you show it's really cool. Thank you and God Bless.
2 time survivor, thank you Tom for speaking truth and reminding others that WE CAN overcome anything and everything TOGETHER 🔥
Dude this song speaks so much truth. I've had a couple family members die due to cancer. But the one family member who stuck out to me was my grandmother because of my father. My father was mentally handicapped and when his mother was dying of cancer literally on her death bed was the first time I had ever seen him shed a tear 😢. The only reason I bring that up is because he passed away 2 years ago and I know and hope that he is with his mother.
This song hits hard. Couldn't watch the whole thing but I definitely will watch again. Thank you for putting out music with messages rathers then disrespectful trash or gibberish like some people.
Great song 🤩🙏❤
Idc what anyone says..... Tom Tom is the best storyteller and that's facts... Change my mind🤷‍♀️
I lost my father figure and best friend to lung cancer a few years back. I would give up all what little wealth I have for five more minutes to speak to him. He taught me my manners, respect and life lessons. We used to rebuild old cars after school my senior year and the summers that followed and I just bought a 31 Ford to restore in his honor. I took the last years i had with him for granted, never knowing he had cancer and always thinking he would be around. Called him about everything from girlfriends, car questions or just to update him where I was when I was traveling. He was always happy and I just wish I spent more time with him towards the end. He had a pain, went to the hospital and theh told him he had stage 3 lung cancer. Since the cancer already made it to his lymp nodes he was gone in a month. Miss him every fucking day.
This is a beautiful song tom
Everyone dies.   Get over yourselves people.   Know this.  Life is cool for a little while and then it ultimately turns to shit. Doesn't matter how rich or poor you are.   Doesn't matter what race or religion you believe in.   Doesn't matter if you're a square or a serial rapist. LIFE FUCKING SUCKS.   Doesn't mean we want to hear about it while listening to music!   Music is supposed to be a way for us to escape the cold heartedness of this world. It's NOT TO REMIND US OF HOW TERRIBLE IT IS  and to remind us of all our loved ones that HAVE and WILL DIE during our life times!   I lost two of my best friends to suicide within a matter of 3 years.   I was abused both physically and mentally as a child growing up in a foster home. I was molested by a neighbor and was called a liar when I finally decided to let people know. What's next?  Write a song about everyone dying of suicide?  Of all the children getting molested? I'm sorry but this song is fucking TRASH!  WAY TO RUIN MY EVENING TOM!
Toms the artist we all in our lives!!
Tom you hit that nail right on the head. Awesome song. I'm fighting cancer right now I've been going to MD Anderson for over two and a half years. This disease affects everyone in your life. At first I thought it was only affecting me until I saw how my family was reacting to this too. All I thought of after that was fight. I'm not going down with out fighting this cancer. I'M STILL HERE FIGHTING!!!
I tell you what I am a 22 year old full grown man. Not just any man. I am even a Marine and I still cried. This song hits me hard. I lost my grandma who was raising me at 11 years old to lung cancer. They sent her home on a hospital bed after being in the hospital for nearly a month they said there was nothing they could do for her. They said she had 6 months to live. I saw my grandpa the toughest man I've ever met get down on his knees at night and pray for her in tears. She died 13 days later. She didn't even make it 2 weeks let alone 6 months.... its a terrible thing to watch someone go through.... her last words to me where "find something you love and help people." I hope I am making her proud.
Prayers to all whom struggle. The addiction just keeps accumulating the cancer patients find it hard to be patient when all your doing is waiting. The beauty of life eats me alive. Everyday I strive in mind to find out what happiness is like. But being human is the beautiful part about it yet where is humanity when the planet needs it. We all push and pull strugglin one way or another just to find cover or love from another. The pantry has very little to give an the takers keep on taking an the giving just keep on giving till theirs nothing left to give. For a cancer patient or anyone more deserving than me I'd offer my last breath or any body part of me to see a life come to live a beautiful journey that I yet cant see or take for granat caus i dont understand it. Much love to everyone literally to all life it's to short. To short.....
Damn my ma just passed from C
This song hit me deep... As a 24 year old enlisted US Marine (of 160lbs) I was diagnosed with stage II testicular cancer. The 5 military doctors I saw wanted to castrate me...so I found an oncologist at Emory University that said he could save my 'libido'.  Long story short after two major surgeries 30 days apart, (right orchiectomy & retroperitoneal lymph node dissection) I had lost 45lbs. I then went on to complete 4 cycles of chemotherapy, which was 8 hours per day, 5 days a week over a period of 5 months. I lost every hair on my body in the first cycle and the nausea was constant. By the third cycle my weight had dropped to 92lbs...I looked and felt like walking death, literally. At that point I decided to disobey the doctor, the CO, the state, and federal law as I began to use marijuana. I gained almost 40lbs in the final 6 weeks with an increase in appetite and a decrease in nausea provided by MaryJane. That was 25 years ago... #CancerSurvivor #FUCKchemo  The message in your music is powerful  and I admire your courage in challenging the system on every level.   Thank you, Tom... much respect.  #hangovergang  #SmokeWeedEveryday
May your messages change the future. May the future prosper, I know most of your music tom hits me right in the hearticles
I have an adoptive sister trying to survive Cancer right now. I have a big sister who is a breast cancer survivor. I have a niece who is a breast cancer survivor. There are some very good supplements that help you body fight cancer. L-Carnosine is great.  IP-6 with Inositol. those are just 2 there is Quercetin with bromelain and Vit C. My adoptive sister is taking all three of these along with Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vit D-3, Vit K. Her last check up, they said the Cancer does not seem to be growing now, it's still there, but it's in stasis. Thanks again Tom!  Love ya man!
This song is proof that grieving never ends and memories are forever powerful.  My mom survived for 4 years when she had 6 months and did not pass until she was refused treatment.  Thank you for putting this out there to keep fleeting memories alive.
im going to assume the 2.7k that thumbed this down only didnt want to be reminded of those they lost or maybe havent known anyone with cancer and to those lucky ones, hope you dont have to go through it, when i was younger (10) my grandpa had colon cancer, and from what i gather, died from after effects from the surgery to get rid of it (this was in 93), and more recently my uncle had cancer in his throat from acid reflux, well not from, but it was a contributing factor i think, an didnt make it but fought for many years
THANK YOU
I’m so proud of calling my self your FAN
Rip Grandma 👵  You fought your best to defeat so falled cancer.  From chopping off one of your breast; chasing to your liver to kill you.   I love you and miss you. 🙏
Much love to this...xox
You're so right.  We breathe, we drink water, we eat food & risk cancer from all of it. Gave me literal goosebumps. Best song you've ever done, Tom!
Thank you someone needed to say that for us cancer patients no one understands thank you from Connecticut
I lost my dad to Throat cancer in 2014 I still remember the silence in room in between each breath he took we all were waiting for him to make another  then around 4:30 the nurse came in and gave him morphine and then he passed in silence I still remember waiting for the rise and fall of his chest
My grandmother, my rock, my very first partner in crime and my biggest cheerleader passed away from cancer on Thursday (10/15) and my heart is shattered.  I was overwhelmed when I saw this release and again when I listened/watched because the pain of her passing is so fresh but, I love it.  Thank you for this beautiful tribute to everyone fighting this horrible disease! This was her second round with Cancer but, they were different types and just 5 years apart.  She fought hard and was gracious, loving and encouraging to US, her family, the entire time SHE was sick.  I hate that this diseases takes the strongest and wounds everybody who loves them, my heart goes out to every and anybody that has to endure the gauntlet that Cancer demands from the diagnosed and their loved ones.  Sending love to those still fighting and those that couldn't anymore, you are all warriors!  Keep fighting! 💜    🦋🦋 P.S. My grandma was a big fan too 🙂
My wife's sister was taken 15 years ago from a cancer that could have been stopped. A medical oversight caused her to lose her sister.   This one got me in the feels man.
Spitting bars
They killed my mom. She went to doctor & ER over & over just to be sent home & blamed arthritis & diabetes. The doctor in a hospital an hour away said she had it 3 to 5 years. My mom was at doctor's at least twice a month. My sister & I called her doctor's nurses telling them something wasn't right with our mom. 7 days she lived in a hospital before the cancer took her, but she suffered far longer. Two doctors & two hospitals are going to answer for her death & I will fight to my death for the doctors involved to lose their licenses. They didn't just let her die at 68, they forced her to suffer in extreme pain. By the time she died she had initial lymphoma (curable) to spreading to her liver, lungs, kidneys, & spine. She will not have died in vain. I vow to call every attorney I have to & every media outlet in the US. They killed my mom.
According to the state of California everything from China causes cancer. Things last half as long for buck or two cheaper because we imported it from someone that stole it.
This hots home my 5 year old  nephew  hulk has a rare form of cancer he beat it once now hes fighting  it again
I watch my father in law get eaten by this and he told us all NO. NO dont ever give up and fight till you can't and fight some more. I won't cry for this even if it breaks open so many wounds. I will say yes we need a better treatment plan and yes we should be past the old treatment and I will encourage anyone and everyone to keep fighting. We are beautifully destroyed and yet we are hopelessly optimistic so lets keep at  a cure cause I don't want to put another child into the ground.  God bless all of you and I pray everyday for the cure to leukemia or pancreatic anything.
My mam passed away last month with terminal cancer, she got told 5 year to live 8 years ago, she was a FIGHTER till the very end! I was right next to her when she took her last breath and wiped the tear away from her cheek when she took her last breath only I seen that tear! The song is so true i do believe there is a cure but it all boils down to money! I know my mam is pain free now and her strength and her fight has passed over  to me! RIP MAM I LOVE YOU ❤ I LOVE YOU TOM!
How can I collab with you
Mara uncal ko cancer thi par ab ek dam thik h call kara 7719532128
I watched my grandad go from a jolly plump happy man of about 15 stone to a 6 stone bag of bones he never forgave my mom at the end cos she allowed me to go and see him in his last week I was only 12, still have nightmares about it sometimes, he was my world he taught me how to ride a bike , play football, draw, spelling and picked me up from school and bought me a comic and an ice Lolly everyday , it was after losing him I started experimenting with drugs and alcohol from 13 on, I’m 45 now abs my heads still a mess, thanku Tom & nova for understanding there’s only u, nf & Eminem that make anything that’s real thought provoking lyricism anymore, the rest just haven’t got a clue , thanks again, fuck lung cancer, fuck all cancer ur right Tom there’s a cure somewhere but they’re not gonna kill their cash cow
I’m crying bruh😭😭
Look YT Took Tom off of Trending ! BULLSHIT !
👏
Thank you for making this song for your fans and future fans!!!! And thank you for making this for us to share! #Tom4president I believe in my heart knowing and listening to you for years watching the change and putting the past behide you! Even tho you speak the truth and get haters for doing it!  Yet you speak for people and to the people!  Makes me wonder what music you listen to or story's you hear face to face! The mental mentality you put into your songs. How does the words you want to speak flow out onto paper? Are you stressed and staying up for days on end?or is it like painting you hear and listen to your fans and then inspire them? I have problems speaking, stuttering, and reading including having words I want to say gets jumbled up as I talk and my mind jumps around. Seizures have always took a toll on my body and my mind. Yet the complexities of words and ou choose your not scared to say them. My voice and story will never be heard, being bullied in school and having a seizure theme song after still scars my mind having music like this really relaxes  my mind and forget about my pain and remember others that are tormented day in and day out either in a dark place, a disease,  loss of a loved one, or the day struggle of a person in more dire need.  I dont care it this is long but you Tom are 1/256 ppl in a room that recognize that society has to change or it will just get worse.
Very very good song it just wasn't  a sad sad song like I thought it was gonna be and I have and still do fight demons I'm a recovering addict, and I thought this song most of all more than anything  very encouraging 🙏
The cure to cancer isnt a syringe, or chemo or a pill or a perscription. Its your diet. Cancer is a little worm that eats what you eat and grows off what you eat. Eat fruits and vegetables. Cancer, and any type of disease grows off of, alcohol, cigarettes (obvioisly), sugar, meat, milk and all dairy. Cancer cannot live off of fruits vegetables nuts and seeds therefore having it starve. Eat what god created for us, not what we lived off of. Eat an alkaline diet, food based on a ph scale. Kale, celery, watermelon, cucumbers, spinach, etc. All those beautiful leafy greens that god intended for us. Chemo only urges us to eat mcdonalds or the easiest thing we see, just to make the pain it causes. And ironically the first thing doctors would tell you is "dont eat raw fruits or vegetables" but they dont say anything about mcdonalds. Hmm. Stay up america. I love you
1 luv Tom!
I grow my hair to donate it for some kid can have a wig.  I'm a high risk myself to get cancer.  But I'll keep growing my hair out as many times as I can.  Great song man.  Shed light on this industry because there is a cure.  But why give out the cure when there is no money to be made from it.
12 yr breast cancer survivor,  in remission for rectal cancer. Husband died of lung cancer. It can be beaten. Won't do treatments again. Chemo's left me with to any health issues. Will go to see the Grand Canyon then to Oregon. Check out with dignity.
Pur alkaline kills cancer safely. Lung cancer just use pur baking soda in a mist breathing machine.💪💪😊
Love to this legend.✌ peace
My daughter is a survivor. 8 when she was diagnosed, 9 when she had a bone marrow transplant. She is the strongest person I have ever met. She is 25 now and cancer free. Late effects will always be part of her life. I've never felt more useless than watching her suffer through treatment.   #HOGforever
This does touch the string. My wife is currently fighting breast cancer. If I could take it away from her and take it for myself I would do it in a heart my wife is definently a fighter  and hasn't lost yet!!  Ty for the video esspcially being overseas away from her makes harder for me since I can't be there.
I lost my mom to breast cancer when I was 11 months old. I lost my dad after 16 year, 2 remission, and c-diff to Hodgkin's lymphoma.  I'm sitting in my patrol car just crying my heart out.
Thanks for this I'm not into this type of music I only listen to metal but this helped my father passed of cancer in 2018 and my mother in March of this 2020 got breast cancer
Maaaan anyone who disliked this is going to hell for sure! 2 of my moms best friends both have acute myeloid leukemia rn and this song just popped up in my recommended at the perfect time, I’m hoping it’s a sign of good news that they will both make it out. Cancer is no joke, the timing of this song is too perfect and Tom never ceases to make powerful, meaningful music. To the 2k people that disliked:   Just be better...
Wholesome
Both my grandmother and grandfather passed away from cancer , grandmother awhile ago but my grandfather a year ago this hits hard !! Thank you , Also I know it wasn't due to cancer but my aunt just passed a day ago due to covid (still this song hits hard none the less for that too) glad to have music like this by my side whenever I need it !! Tom again thank you you truly have no idea how many peoples lives you have touched for this one
I was diagnosed of herpes 3 years, and ever since then i have been taking treatment to prevent outbreaks, burning and blisters, but there was no improvement until i came across testimonies of Dr. VOODOO on how he has been curing different people from different diseases all over the world, then i contacted him. After our conversation he sent me the medicine which i took according to his instructions for up to 2 weeks. After completing the medication i went back to my doctor for another test and the virus was all gone and i was completely cured, since then i have not had any signs of outbreak. I'm so filled with joy. With herbal medication Herpes Virus is 100% curable. I refer Dr VOODOO to everyone out there with the virus Email: voodoospelltemple66@gmail.com Add Dr voodoo on whatsApp +2348140120719
Tom you are without a doubt a remarkable man im pleasantly surprised by you more every video i see great job. You proof to the world that someone can look different even strange but have a big heart. You sir cannot hide the good in you its easy to see now. Thanks for the video
Dear Tom,  Love the song man. My best friends of 26 yrs father died about 6 years ago from cancer. I miss that man everyday he was like a father to me. Everybody cherish yalls loved ones. Keep them close and keep fighting  dont ever stop.  Sincerely,   The orphan with love
I lost my mama almost 8 years ago from cancer I took her to her treatments I know the f****** pain that goes through to the people that they ain't got dog that that hit hard I can't get no better brother hangover gang
Nicely done
Keep em comin Tom.👊
Can you make a song about alcoholism.? I just turned 25 on the 16th October. I've been drinking heavy and every day since I was 13. I need some help. For me, my fiance and my 8month old child. I wanna change but idk how.
Awesome!! Good job Tom. My friend just told me an hour ago that’s she’s going through a divorce. My mom has pancreatic cancer and my brother just passes away. We all can relate!! Keep it up. Love your music
It's bad enough they have a cure but don't want the whole world to know I lost my own mother to cancer in 2013
Thank you. This intence.  This helpful . This is painful. This is needed. I thank you.  Though you may not believe I do, but God bless you.  Thank you.
I like how he's one of the only rappers touching these subjects,at his level face it i think hes hokey sometimes certain songs,but he can rap his ass off...hey he's very successful numbers don't lie so  #misfitworld Approves
Thank you Tom MacDonald!
The greatest Lyrical rapper of all time hands-down anybody who says name is a fucking hater show me someone better
We get cancer from trying to keep our demons a secret. That is words from above.
Tom is a modern day hero. Keep up the fight! This man is a treasure
The dislikes must be from trump supporters
Well shit.... i doubt many people expected this from Tom but f*** it. I personally appreciate messages like this, and I'm guessing there mightve been something that happened to him to spark this kind of motion. Well done man. Great message.
♥️♾💪💯😇🙏
WoW.....
Wish I could shake your hand for this song! thank you
Wow Tom you hit the song on the head about cancer . My dad died and uncle has died from it ,they should have a cure for it but they won't make it .
🙏🙏🙏💯😇💪♾🌏
❤️   Check me out
Tom ty for this video I been a metal head from child hood but i love music with a message and all your songs have that so from an ole fat guy from NC ty you have given me a new push and that goes for you and nova both seriously from the bottom of my heart thank you thank you thank you i can't say it enough thank you and thank yall
Lost my Father to it.
This song hit me hard, cried. I'm a survivor and it was pure hell and still is.
This song is beautiful and touched my heart., thank you Tom.
This is probably the realest song that has ever been in the history of music... Hate him if you want but this is real life shit and he has the balls to say it, I respect that
I posted a reaction to this one but it seems like YouTube is suppressing a lot of my videos because I talk about a lot of conservative politics. It doesn't seem to be coming up in search results. If you'd like to check it out:  https://youtu.be/88ls5D2wdQU  Also my People So Stupid reaction: https://youtu.be/yNkx8f2mqPM
Man Tom makes songs telling the truth but this is serious have faith and fight it you are brave.
Tom, my mom died of Cancer 04.25.2020 my heart is broken like something I cant explain. I also had cancer last year. I had Hodgkin's lymphoma stage 2b. I was able to beat cancer, but Tom, it took my mom. Sometimes I wish it took me instead but then i remembered i promised my mom I would make her a proud grandmother and at the end of this month, I'm going to the doctor to do just that. I'm going to call my baby my mothers name if it's a girl or my uncles name (he died of cancer too) if it's a boy.   Damn Tom this song hit me hard. Tears are rolling down my face.  But thank you for bringing awareness. Thank you for making music that touches the soul. Thank you man, thank you.  God bless you.
I get what you were trying to do with this song Tom, and it’s an overall positive message, but I have to take exception to the first few verses. The suggestion that there is some cure being hidden away but the “cancer industry” is hiding it for money is preposterous. Many of the doctors and nurses who treat this disease also have the disease or friends and family with this disease. What a slap in the face to the thousands of medical providers and researchers who devote our lives to fighting this disease.
I just lost 2 family members in the last 4 days due to cancer, so this hit home..
I had cancer when I was 11 and 3 surgeries and radiation therapy and I have to take the pills for life and I feel good
I lost my 3rd grade teacher who was a family friend to cancer.  RIP Mrs. Baughman.
Currently growing my hair out to make a wig for a little girl with cancer. She told me "you have long beautiful hair, are you a prince?"   She doesnt know its her hair im growing :,)
Dope and true.  Empire of cash on death makes billions.
My grandma ended up with cancer. She lives on the other side of the country. We saw her a year ago and she got diagnosed this winter. I can’t go see her because of COVID and money. She doesn’t like calling, so I write her, she said it make her feel like people remember her. 🖤🖤
the good might go to haven and the bad might go to hell,but no one wants to live here you can tell..damn man..👍👍👍
Amazing song and message bro keep it up.  👊🏻
I'm gonna share this every day until everyone I know hears it this message needs to be heard
Bout time someone in the light finally said this not like a lot of us haven't already known this for a while now. If only at this point we unite and do something real about it. Need to tear down the door and stop knocking on it. Good job Tom.
There's been a cure for cancer since the '60s and it was suppressed and the inventor was murdered. Electromagnetic healing apparatus or something like that. "If you want to know the secrets of the universe think frequency and vibration" Nikola Tesla.
I lost my dad to cancer great song Tom
Tom's a goat raps about stuff that really no one else will keep it up!
1 million love
Lost my grandmother a few years ago.. nana shortly before her. Now I'm watching my mother battle her second fight.... this hits home... Thank you
Tom you did a great job man thank you for this it’s what I needed to hear!! I know too many people who have been take cause of this terrible sickness. Thank you.
Amazing song - thanks for making me cry homie.
https://youtu.be/i958beDLdoY
My dad died of cancer when I was 6. He fought for 3 long years and passed on June 19 2004. I think about him everyday. Now ive found some lumps on me and I need to go to the doctor now and get checked out. This is hits home Tom thanks.
My mom's best friend who is like my s cond mom was diagnosed with cancer but with hope she beat it. And great video tom ur an amazing pearson
Fuckin awesome Tom!!! Brought me to tears... My pops has leukemia got 2 yrs left... Love your music man thx
Some of the most powerful lyrics I've ever heard. You strike a chord with a lot of people with how you touch on the things we all secretly struggle with. Much love to you Tom and Nova!
There's no money in the cure of cancer. I've been battling stage 4 breast cancer for over two years. Went to Mexico for treatment,  i arrived in a wheelchair and walked out on my own.  Mexico gave me the strength to fight. Weed gave me my life back. Never give up. Keep fighting.  God bless
I balled my fucking eyes out hearing this for the first time and it really made me think of the struggle my family members and others have gone through. Much love to anyone struggling with cancer my heart goes out to everyone ❤️❤️❤️
I 10000% believe there has been or is a cure they refuse to let us have because of greed for money and how profitable the pharmaceutical industry is. It’s so incredibly sad.
I lost my grandma too soon to cancer.. she honestly should be here to see her great granbaby but cancer took her I watched such a strong woman who raised me and protected me from the abuse of my father he still abused me but she made it better...
Almost all of his songs give my chills
Dude you broke me... i can’t even
I dont think I've ever shared someone's music to my social media before. Hell, I dont even know the true pain of losing someone to cancer but i have shared this for my friends to see... There was a very powerful message here and something about it made me tap into some sentiments that the military had taught me to lock away.. Good job man, and keep up the great work while all of us hurry up and wait for your next masterpiece 🇺🇲🍻
To address the metalhead Fantano fuckboys who literally came over here to spread hate, even on this kind of song.  Really? Do you really think its not an asshole thing to hate on a song about cancer and the people who go through it? Kind of a shitty thing to do even though its a Tom Macdonald song, you aren't any better than the person you are literally hating on as well, considering the fact you would stoop as low to berating people who have gone through these events and show them no remorse no matter what they've gone through. Put down the phone and look in the mirror, you're the scum of the earth.
I took my mom to the stylist when she had lung cancer and was going through treatment. She was losing her hair and they were kind enough to offer free, professional wigs to cancer patients. I remember when she shaved he head. When it went into remission it was the first time I ever saw her natural hair color. She let it grow in naturally and I never realized how beautiful her natural hair color was. Cancer takes a lot from us, but it also gives *something* back. When you live through something like that you don't really take life for granted any more. Momento mori, my friends. Mono no aware.
I'm a big lil Wayne fan because on his mixtapes u lyrical cant touch him. But you tom have so much meaning and realness to ur music that your on a 2 pac level
Keep telling them the truth man I appreciate the bravery it takes to fight the system. And to all those fighting the fight against cancer I’m praying for you and my love is right there with you friend your not alone
My sis died to leukemia at 18. She had it since 3. I was born to give her my bone marrow to try and save her life. It gave her an extra 10 years.
Thanks Tom for this wonderful song.  My father survived a horrible bout of testicular cancer for 5 years.  He had over 70 chemo treatment during all that and I was only 5 at the time and never thought I would ever have my father but he survived for another 20 years and passed away in July of this year from a heart attack.  I was fortunate to have him in my life and glad he stuck around with us.  I miss him so much!!  your song is an inspiration to a lot of people🤙🏻🤙🏻
Watching my aunt die from colon cancer was the hardest thing I’ve gone through yet. She had so much faith and was so loving towards me right to the very end. 💛 In a lot of ways, she saved me.
Facts
❤❤❤
Very emotional man I love your music it has realistic base keep it up this is what the world needs
Mate this video/song really hits me hard, I lost my dad 10 years ago to cancer, for 3 months I was by his bedside slowly watching him deteriorate, I got the call from my mum 3am saying that she thought he was ready, I literally was 1 minute late for his last breath. Hopefully a cure is released someday soon. It's no way for someone to go out, id hate to think of my 2 girls watching me slowly pass away from this horrible disease. Sorry for the long comment and thanks for this great song bro. Keep up your awesome work. Cheers
Truth :-(
I WOULD GLADLY CHANGE PLACES WITH MY RONNIE... I MISS MY POPS (BRAIN CANCER) & SISTER (CERVICAL CANCER)  SO MUCH
Yo Tom ! My mother survived breast cancer she loved your video bro keep making good music 💪🏼  nice hope you read comments
To the 2.6k people who thumbed down.. why? For what reasons?
Awesome song and video. Keep it up Tom MacDonald. The system is the cancer and needs cutting out. Regards from the uk
myt 98 yr old granma came down with breast cancer this year we started the kimo wish us luck
Thank u for making this song i lost my grandfather to cancer last year 😢 💔
Thanks, Tom. My favorite line was when you said/say, “Our best defense is living like we do not know what cancer is.” Cancer tests are at least 85% inaccurate according to Adam Conover from the Adam Ruins Everything TV show.
I can't listen to this song...it's an amazing song..but it hits way too close to home. I love your music...keep them coming🥺
remember bro ur changing the world i hope more people will wake up and maybe one day we will fight the system cos they doin aint right
Way to throw it down Tom. You are saying what we all want to be heard. You are a hero for that. Keep up all the good work man.
This one hits home i dont have cancer but I am very sick I need blood once a week and not going to live a long life I just got to be a fighter!!!
WOW.
God is with you all through the good and bad
I see this is an emotional topic but how can you even have that cold of a heart to dislike such a touching message. Thats sad
Amazing song and video again Tom...to those who gave it a thumbs down you people  are stupid as hell man
My dad just passed away from Stage 4 Melanoma Cancer on Wednesday morning this past week. Damn....
Tom my grandmother had cancer tumors 2 of them in her brain they removed them she forgot everyone and who they were but she always said I was her number one grandson and before we pulled the plug after weeks of helping her she looked at me the day before and said I love you Justin the next day she was basically gone had a breathing machine to breath for her so we ended her suffering but this song made me remember all the good times we had thank you Tom so much
So he’s pushing a conspiracy theory
Amazing as always love it
My favorite Rapper 💙💙
Bro. I'm speechless. This song did make me cry and I hardly cry. Ur gonna be a hero to the people who need it. We need to share this.
This was AMAZING!
Lost my great grandfather to lung cancer at the age of twelve he made me who I am today I was always excited to go to his house after a hunting trip to make him proud of the success of the trip by the end he would smile and laugh through the coughing he fought until the end never give up hope any of you we all care and we are with you.
I know where I’m going when I die, because Jesus lived the perfect life that I was required to live, and Jesus died the death my sins deserved, and because I trust Him instead of me, I will be with Him in paradise.
Lost my grandma who was my best friend to pancreatic cancer thank you so much for this 😭😭
Amazing brother
GREAT, GREAT VIDEO!!! TOM, BRO, YOU'RE AN AMAZING PERSON BRO!!! I DONT THINK YOU HAVE ONE BAD SONG, VIDEO, OR ALBUM!! I CAN LISTEN ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT NON-STOP BRO!! YOURE AN AMAZING ARTIST!! YOU AND NOVA ROCK IT OUT FOR REAL!!! YOU SPEAK FROM THE HEART AND THIS SONG SHOWS IT!!!!  I CAN BE IN A BAD MOOD OR DEPRESSED MOOD AT WORK OR AT HOME AND I PUSH PLAY ON TOM MACDONALD AND EVERYTHING CHANGES!! YOURE AWESOME BRO!!!  JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A FAN FOR LIFE RIGHT HERE!!!  AND YES I CRIED ON THIS VIDEO!! IT TOUCHES THE SOUL!!!!
Hey just wanted to tell you how much this song means to me. I was diagnosed with cancer when my son was 6 weeks old. I took 2 rounds of chemo and radiation after that. All my hair fell out, I felt so ugly. I promised god if I made it thru I would never cut it again. My son just turned 25 in August and my hair is so long I have to move it to keep from setting on it. So far so good but I know if I ever come out of remission I will fight til my last breathe like a true warrior. Thank you so much for making this song. I have 4 grown kids and 11 grandchildren.i felt so alone when I was going through this. I felt so alone. #hangovergang
Dude even if some don’t like you stuff , you are realest out there. Keep it up brother
Tom MacDonald - Thank you bro for making this.  My wife is fighting Colon Cancer currently.  This video just made me cry like a baby when I looked at my wife.  My three kids know she is sick but that is it.  We are fighting like hell and that is all that matters.  Keep doing what your doing bro.  You are amazing my dude.
I lost my grandfather in 2001 to leukemia.  Last month, we lost my Great-Uncle, my grandfather's older brother to exact same type of leukemia. I have a good friend who's been battling cancer for going on three years. I've seen three men go from being healthy, strong, vibrant human beings, to shells of their former selves. I've seen cancer  with my own eyes and ive stared right in it's face. Cancer is an evil pestilence that is o ky here to make the rich big pharmaceutical companies richer.
Damn ..okay sent
Beautiful
That hits so close to my heart! I lost my mother, father and older sister to cancer all within 2 yrs of each other! I’ve come to terms this will most likely be my path as well!
Tom macdonald you speak the truth, my mom had cancer twice and she Survived and I'm blessed thank GOD! But the being i thought that too Idk how many donation I've given to help with the cause and walked, i sometimes think they are just taking the money but i really don't want to think that! But I know people who didnt survive! So for all the ones who are fighting 👊💪🔥❤
You did it again Fam♡
Wow that's touching
🔥
I have bone cancer. And kidney cancer this just touched me cause  disability denied and insurance don't want to pay!
I'm sure many will say the same. Cancer took two of the strongest people from me. Two people that shaped my life and crafted me into the person I am. To all those who are suffering or have suffered we are all with you. We cannot take your pain away or give you energy when you are tired, but we will stay with you the entire way. To all those who have lost or will lose someone to this demon I have one thing to say. FUCK CANCER!
This video just hit me hard as shit. I've beaten breast cancer and bone cancer. I'm still in remission but 22 years with it looming over every thought not knowing whats gonna happen. I couldn't have put it better than this song💙
my husbands grandfather died from 5 different cancers last year..
Damn...... You sir are unstoppable
Yo who tf are the 2k who disliked this?
Who the heck is giving this a thumbs down?
One of your best  videos
This hit different. I just lost my pops to cancer and it hits home.
Lost my mom January 5th, this year. She battled a little over a year. She is at rest now, but the painful part of it she was with her only grandson for 7 months. Now he will grow up not knowing how much love his mimi had for him. Thank you Tom, this is by far your best song. God bless...

On how to end the world you dumb f—k’s!!!!  won’t tell the truth about there asses been behind all the bullshit. That nuclear bombing crazy shit needs to stop ASAP!
Wow, made me cry like a baby
The government has actually made many cancer treatments illegal.  It’s worse than just not being able to afford treatments.  We are nothing more than commodities.  We need to break from Big Pharma.  Change the way we approach health.
1.1 million in 3 days congratulations Tom
Ive listened to this song so many times since you released it, im suprised i dont know the lyrics by heart yet. Lost my best friend last year to leukemia 8-21-2019. And lost many family members to other types of cancer. I think of all of them when i listen to this!  Thanks bud
I’ve never cringed so hard in my life. Stick to making racist videos man. This was not it.
If your so smart...u make the fucking cure.
Good work Tom.  Keep up the awesome content and follow your heart buddy!
Good stuff bro!
This had me crying like a baby.  During the lockdown crap, my father found out he has stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Thank you Tom for once again giving us a piece of your art that has so much more meaning than most of the shit on the radio. So update things have gotten a little worse, especially financially and so we created a GoFundMe to help him pay for his bills, basic necessities, and medicines he needs. If anyone could please share this link to spread the word, hopefully, it will reach someone who is in a secure place in life that can afford to donate a little bit. Any little bit helps, even if it's just kind words.  gf.me/u/y6iv5n
Pure Art bro, strong message and hits home for everyone! Love this side of your talent!
Wow.. the ole ladys crying and I'm fight the tears.. very touching 😢 💙
Thank you Tom! Awesome video
You Spittin true facts
Btw Nova, amazing directorship as always 😁 ❤️ you both
As much I am a fan of your music, I think quite possibly this is your most epic piece Tom.... This is real shit...
Hey Thomas!!!  I understand that song you wrote made and produced from your heart. !!! I would really like to touch basics in life with you.  Not many people don't give af and EXPRESS our feeling bout life like a lot of us do. Some day find me and let's express life in real format.    Marko
Mom has had breast cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer now bone cancer but that’s in remission thank god! She’s 79 years old and she shows me what a hero is she’s my hero!
Your the only rapper who can bring grown men to some tears when he truly feels the lyrics and genuine truth in his music. I can't tell you how much my son and I listen to your music.  He's plays SCFL Football league in The Woodlands Tx and every time he makes a good play he throws his 🤘up and yells "Hangover Gang".  Thanks for everything you do Man. I have days where your the only music I listen to.  Amd this one hit hard both my Papa amd my grandmother died from forms of Cancer. My grandmother had it bad due to cigarettes and my Papa had Colon Cancer.   Both died way too young and I miss them every day. Not having them around when you truly need help with life and being a parent is so rough knowing the main source was vices. Whether it be smoking alcohol or food it won't wear another all the stuff that we take is so bad thanks for recognizing it putting it out to the people. Love you Tom and Nova
Man 1.1mil views in just 3 days. Glad to see that you're getting the exposure you deserve. Someone who is actually rapping about something with meaning and not money, sex, and drugs. Keep it up brother ill be waiting patiently for the next song to drop.
My grandfather died from cancer , and cousin. Cancer is a bitch!!!!! 😡🥺💔
All your songs are amazing but this one hit home hard. I lost my grandpa from cancer a few years ago after his second battle with it. The treatments took him so quickly. I have lost alot of people in life but losing him,  I went through some great struggles and it still feels like yesterday that I lost him. He was what kept our family together. I miss him so much and watching this reminded me of everything he went through and the struggles from the first cancer. Its sad that with all the rich guys and the technology,  families are STILL watching loved ones being taken away from this horrible cancer. It dies suck. I feel like its a way to control and  kill off people. But thats just my opinion. If you can afford it, then maybe you have a much higher chance of surviving but if you are living paycheck to paycheck then you dont have much of a fighting chance. The world is a dirty and scary place. Tom, this was a wonderful video that I'm sure the rest of my family will definitely enjoy listening to. It makes me feel good knowing that others can understand this part of life that some may not have experienced.
1.1m let's go
I've listened to almost every song you have came out with its straight 🔥 the realist shit I have ever heard I wonder what goes on in your head for you to actually come up with the words that so many people want to say if we had more people that thought like you this world would be a better place...
Love all ur music my friend had colon cancer he is fine now im going to get checked for cancer in 2 day's
Srs gave my amazing and beautiful wife 2 years to live... God gave us 7 years and 3 children... I lived 8 years not knowing if today was the day she'd leave us... The last 10 months were guy wrenching... Nova was 38 years old and the most amazing and beautiful woman I've ever met in my life... She helpes me find God, because there's no way having 4 blessings didn't have help from above... RIP Nova, until we see each other again...
Cancer dont run, in my family but I feel the pain, and im not backwards
Facts filled song
30 seconds in and I'm bawling. I miss my grandfather we lost him in 98 to cancer and then his wife in 2019 to cancer. #fuckcancer Tom I love you.
I don't have cancer. But im terminally Ill. They say I could have 2 years or less. I have struggled with treatment after treatment, doctor appointments, failed treatments. Ive been through denial, anger and right now im at acceptance. I struggle everyday. I have taken care of the dying for 15 years and now I can't work anymore and have become a patient. I do try though, I am financially struggling and id be lying if I said I'm not scared but I refuse to be a victim. God Bless all of you! 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙 Although I would love to, I cant possibly thank everyone personally but I wanted you all to know how grateful I am for all your well wishes, prayers and words of encouragement. You all are beautiful souls and truly have made me smile and I feel not forgotten and alone. So thank you so much. I also will keep you all in my prayers! God bless every one of you! 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
Beautiful! You never cease to amaze me with your music.
I never knew cancer was a very common sickness
To those listening to this that is sick or knows someone who is sick. Embrace the immortal inside the mortal vessel. Death is not nothing, I promise.
Im trying....Tom
Just buried my dad, my hero, my fishing buddy Aug. 13. He had fought prostate cancer twice. Third time got him. Been drinking ever since. Muss you dad so much.
You made me cry in school worth it though
I’m a cancer survivor along with my mom and my brother. It runs in our family bad. It’s been 30 years of surviving; however, always in your mind. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke and I run marathons and cycling 100 milers. But it is still one thing that will take your life without remorse or physical health.
Simple way to keep cancer away, eat the proper food, organic, high nutrient dense foods, GROWN ON PROPER SOIL & less/NO chemicals. Stay away from processed/fast foods & packaged foods with preservatives. Stay away from pharmaceutical drugs & other heavy drugs. Try to avoid having children with person having health issues, you would have a higher risk of breeding sick people. Cleanse your body, herbs(Not just marijuana 🤦‍♂️), colon cleanses etc. Basically cancer is damage to your DNA. Avoid damaging your body with the things u put in it & give the body what it really needs. But he is right so much $$$ they spent yet they still doing shit & killing folks while they take your $$$. I promise you folks the nature way is the TRUE to cure sickness. 💯
Hey Tom what does the Emily mean above your eyebrow
stage 4 lung cancer took my aunt this morning... Im just glad she isnt in anymore pain.
Tom MacDonald always keeping it real.  Thanks brother
TRUTH!
Sorry if there are any spelling errors auto correct so stupid
Place family is Christian so that when the wreath of white me like your song is because just there so true about to ciety  And you're a trump supporter
I'm not trying to be a fake fan telling trying to tell you what to do
But it belongs to a company called Genesis to church Are there actually in jail right now because they were talking the truth and it's really helped thousands of people across the world are my mouth so she think that it's about day no in I can't blame you because thousands of people do but I know that's not because my dad's been taking it for full year it's cleaned out his system he feels great and Tom if you have any bag things that you want a thick slick in your system then you take mms OK
So sorry it's called an mms stupid freaking autocorrect
They have the cure. Gerson Institute.  Look it up. Vegetables.  Alkalizing diet. Cancer grows in a oxygen deprived acidic environment. It also feeds on sugar.  If you're eating foods that turn your blood acidic and all the enzymes in the food are dead you will cause disease. Everyone who has found the cure and were helping people were shut down by the gov or kicked out the country, their cure confiscated by the gov and hidden. Look it up and do your own research and be blessed.
Tom I have to tell you something I really think that your music is amazing um I really think that you like spit in the truth enda I understand why a lot of people don't think that it's good to  Talk the truth but there is a cure to cancer it's not radiation like you mentioned in the song It's actually something called  MMS If you go on Google and you Google and the mass or what is MSA will come up as a bully G and you will die if you take it my dad has been taking it for one full year and he is cleaner system out so I really hope if you have anything that you like on and do and your body to take him amass all everything will be OK
great video Tom, Nova great message
damn there are not enough words and surely not the right words to say thank you for this masterpiece.. truly a masterpiece!! love you man! to the moon and back (on a heterosexual way ;) )
Thank you Tom , I lost my wife shannon Arrand to brain cancer 4 months ago after twenty year’s together , my life is destroyed
I am nine years  old and I love this song and it was sad song and nice job at macking this song tom
Hit home for me.
My dad just had his first post treatment scan for his small cell lung cancer, so far so good. Now we have to fight the damned debt collectors. Its so stupidly expensive to fight...
There should have been a break through by now, I feel there is a cure but it’s being held back. Such a damn shame
I seriously feel people only hate on him just because he spits truth honestly but hey haters dont matter whoever is doing positive out there keep it up 👏🤙
My grandmother fought cancer for over 12 years, started out as breast cancer until it spread like wildfire. She died 2 months ago. She was funny and strong, never let her illness keep her down. I told her over the phone I love her an she died a few hrs after that. Breaks my heart everyday when I call her an no answer. I miss my grandma Soo much she was my best friend. 😭😭 Thank you so much for this song!
This song really hit home for me
Wow wow wow I cannot stop crying incredible my life as we know it
Man this this song hits home. My grandfather died last year of stage 4 prostate, lever, and spine cancer, three weeks after being diagnosed. Months before retirement and 5 months before his first great granddaughter's first birthday.  He worked like 60 hours a week at least and never took a sick day. I can't remember him going to the doctor ever. So remember everyone tomorrow isn't guaranteed and go see the doctor once in awhile. You never know if they might find something early enough to save you. God bless everyone!
This song is speaking to me currently. My dad found out he has stage 4 lung cancer. He just started chemo last week. He’s 73 years old. I’m not ready for him to go. I don’t have the right emotions to even text this out. I just want him to fight and be strong. I’m only 24, my dad had me late in life. I moved to the other side of the country a few years ago. I still need my dad tho!
Love this Tom!!! You are amazing!
Tom McDonald! You are amazing! Love ya bro!
Tears fall a survivor of breast cancer and my son has kidney failure and he is a fighter thank you Tom Mcdonald
I can’t find a reason people want to still even be alive
its been 16 years since i lost my mom to cancer. this shit hit me like a ton of bricks.
R.I.P Anthony Mac Lachlan I know you are now at peace and no longer in pain! Enjoy your time in heaven! R.I.P Auntie I miss you and love you so much twin! I will see you again! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm not crying, you are... Powerful song and video Tom... Sas that no one else has the balls to put something like this out...
I get y’all might not agree with his political opinions or his past music BUT SERIOUSLY THIS WAS AMAZING
Amazing person!
I don’t trust the medical industry whatsoever.
Here’s a story of victory. My cousin fought in Afganistán in the early 2000s and while deployed discovered he had Leukemia. They tried nearly everything they knew at the time to keep him alive but deep down my family thought we were going to lose him. Nothing would’ve been the same without him. While fighting for his country and the cancer he discovered a group of doctors doing experimental treatments in Texas. They took out his bone marrow, irradiated it, and put it back in. His strong will and faith in God is what he believes allowed him to survive. If you or a loved one is fighting, I hope this gives you hope.
❤😭😭
Probably u opened a lot of eyes Tom ❤️
Wow love this song ❤️❤️❤️👍🏾
I expected more
Yo bro, this video literally touches everyone on the planet man.
Half way through 2018 my grandpa was diagnosed with cancer and everything he hurt or couldn't breath he went to the emergency room and they took x-rays and cat scans and still told him it was just bronchitis. I tried to spend as much time as I could with him along with bringing my daughter around who was 1 at the time to see him. Around April or May of last year he ended up in the hospital and I left my friend's wedding reception to go up and see him for the night and took my daughter along so he could see atleast one of his grandkids and he got see her walk and climb on furniture by herself and it lit up his world. That was the last night we saw him because he ended up doing the treatments, he came home one weekend about the last week of May and he was sick and my daughter had a cold, I wanted to take her over there but I didn't want to risk it and Sunday night the ambulance took him to the hospital and he died Monday morning on memorial day. I was devastated he was an awesome person to have around and who could fix anything and had patience to teach anyone about anything that had a motor.
My Grandpa just passed after a 10 month battle to cancer and those months were some of the hardest months of my life and I have been deployed overseas. When he finally passed we were all so Thankful he went peacefully in his sleep but man was it so hard to watch I still cry thinking about it. Love this song Tom keep up the work
I miss my mom.
This guy is so underrated
Just watched this video for the first time and omg I'm in tears. I'm horrible about putting myself in someone else's shoes and I did with both parents and the girl. The emotions are strong with the simplest of words
This song pertains to my sweet baby girl Lexi. She was A boxer who fought her pancreatic cancer so hard. I love you baby girl ill see you again
Miss you, Ashlee...
This song hit way too close to home- losing my dad to cancer, they say if the treatments work it will only put him in remission, and when it comes back it will come back with a Vengeance. Perfect song!! Love the lyrics
My step father has one kidney from it, my moms non Hodgkin's LYMPHOMA, my grandmother died from her 4rth battle after it took both breast and part of her intestines', and on the 4rth battle she was done and chose to go.... This song is deep and means alot to me and many many others pls keep up you work Tom!    Non Hodgkin Lymphoma lymphoma,
As one of the targets of your "fan diss" track and a survivor, thank you for this. Spot on and done with feeling. I appreciate it.
How is there 2600 dislikes?
For all those who have loved ones with this disease, have it themselves or just thinking of it, want to learn about it. ... Read something about Meta-medicine... It is really great that Tom raises awareness and pushes for hope and STRONG THOUGHTS. Because they have a massive effect.
This hit me.. I had A.L.L as a teen and the treatment desroyed my bones. Too much goes into cancer research and not much is changing for the medications and treatments. Diffetent trials come out and when they realize the side affects of one trial a new one comes along. The cycle continues..
Who TF is realer than Tom
This is why people respect this man, thank you Tom, you make the world a better place and you really make us realize we are having to help eachother for the great
This has inspired me to write a song tom idk if youll ever read this or not but ty u have helped me alot in life and helped me see wht i rlly wanted to do u gave me hope tht i could find a job i loved and for tht i thank you
😢❤️
The dislikes is all part of the Pharmaceutical Industry.
Tom I hardly ever comment on anything on YouTube but something wouldn't let me bypass this song without commenting. You hit it out of the park man.  Keep it up. This was 100%🔥!
A song so spot on. It hurts like helll and heals at the sametime. Reminding me of al the loved ones that are ripped away to soon. After all the pain they had, all the hopes and dissapointment the finaly could rest whitout pain. I still mis them everyday.  i comfort myself with the fact that i was soo lucky to have loved and have been loved by a fantastic person. Deepest respect from Holland Tom.
Thank you so much for this man.
Great tune Tom you're the best artist!!!
My uncle has cancer..He might only have 6 months left. We need to find a cure..I cant with this disease..It hurts so bad to know that you are going to die. We need to find a cure, great song and video Tom ❤️
brilliant fairplay on the views tom i love your music touches my soul i depend on music like yours to get me out of my depression at times i lost my mam from that awful disease 💔💔💔 stay safe bruh 👍 keep doin u congrats on your independants on your music 👌👌👌💯👍
This was beautiful ❤️
I lost my aunt to cancer and although I can’t really speak because we weren’t that close but still it’s terrible and never give up hope
Bro, Awesome song and video. Speaking from a person who's wife is a breast cancer server. Made Respect bruh !!!!! #cancersucks
I am watching my dad battle cancer. It hard cause I don't want him to go he is my other rock I may get annoyed with some things he does but who doesn't. He strong, He takes his chemo and still word cause we need the money. My mom can't work but she has internal securitizers. It is hard to see him go through it. the doctor just chasing his cancer throughout entire  his body.
Wow. Just wow.
My mom died 6 years ago the 22nd.  Love this song.
This is weird I just finished breaking bad and got the notification
Hi Tom love your music. This song is so true I lost my father and hero to cancer 10years ago but it feels like just yesterday I was watching him go through the battle.. keep it up man you are EPIC AND SO ARE YOUR LYRICS
You’re a true hero in the dark, don’t let anyone else tell you differently. You’re unstoppable
I watched my mom pass before my very eyes almost 1 year exactly the day she was diagnosed. I didn't know who she was in the end. It so cruel. This life is just so cruel.  Cancer runs in my family & I am almost certain of my fate as well. But until then, I don't think about it. There isn't anything I can do about it. If it is Gods will, then so be it I suppose.
Makes me miss my grandma. I was the last person in my family to see her awake and lively. We all stayed at my grandparents for a week when I was really little (maybe 7?). I just remember waking up on the couch in the middle of the night because I heard something. I saw her come out of the bathroom to go lay back down. I remember my parents saying she couldn't leave her bed and didn't have to go to the bathroom because she had a bag so I was really confused why she was moving around. She had the biggest grin on her face that I've ever seen. She kissed my forehead, told me she loved me, and I went back to sleep. When I woke up in the morning, she was already gone. I was the last to say goodbye.   My sister also just beat cancer about 2 years ago. It's very prevalent in the women in my family. This song really hit home for me. I've never had any song in my life move me to tears. Great work, Tom. I'm glad you're making it big.
Between radiation and chemotherapy give us a million and we can promise that you will survive. Oh I’m sorry your low income the best we can do is give 3 months to live. Honestly how can a doctor give you expiration date, that’s a death sentence because you wanna give up at that point. This is America we rather make you pay for death instead of fixing the problem.
My mom, my best friend, and a very close love of mine is all battling right now.  This hit home hard and I will forever share this song.  Thank you Tom!
Well put! Population control.
I know you regret all those ugly ass tattoos on your face post Malone done it but he’s look cool and you’re nowhere near on the same level is him
Hi tom McDonald   I saw your  cancer  video  I  was  thinking  you  can  you  can  make  downs syndrome  awareness music  videos
With god we all know where we will go when we die
LOVE ALL YOU DO SIR! GOD BLESS!
Wow!!!
Tom you are a blessing to the music industry. Thanks for this inspirational lyrics. 😭😭
Another awesome song. I'm glad God pulled Tom out of his darkness because we need him. So many messed up things happening in this world and Tom will be here to address them all and keep it real. Keep kicking ass Tom!
My dad has stage 4 bladder cancer... he’s still fighting but I know he won’t last forever... this hits me on a personal level.
Song gives me chills it's a real life message thanks Tom 🤙💯🔥🔥🔥
U can put things into words , whats in my head and cant voice.  I love how u dig what we all wanna say just dnt know how

I just driving home ,I saw my grandma and grandpa. My dear grandpa has 4 stage cancer. They are my angels. They are so kind I wish I could take away the pain ,it’s just  not fair to be in so much pain ... Thank you Tom and Nova 🤍
Fuck man...♥️
Dammit, man...you really need a tear warning at the start of this. And then the personal stories in the comments...I just wasn't ready for the emotion. I hope that whoever inspired you to make this wins their battle(s). While I lived 2,300 miles away and wasn't there in person, I had to hear and see through phone calls and emailed images my grandmother lose her two-year battle with dementia, and the slow demise from a very strong, cogent woman to what she had become in the months leading up to her passing was extremely similar to how cancer destroys its victims, just in different ways. I do not wish anything like these diseases on any human being, and the scars created in those left behind to grieve their deaths never truly heal.
Great song Tom Macdonald I had cancer 15 years ago lucky I found it early and I survived for now.but the hardest part of my treatment was I had to walk by the children's department on my way to  treatment and seeing all the young kids 2-10 years old made me cry knowing that some of them won't make it but they still had smiles on there faces
Tom, this song is awesome! I listened the first time, second time I watched the video and I cried. Keep doing what youre doing.
Big pharma doesn't make cures. It makes customers.  There are cures that very few are even allowed to know exist. The rich don't care about our suffering
this song  in  a sense  spoke to  me because  my  sister  died  of  acute  leukemia  last  year.
Real Raw. So True.
Damn 🙏🔥
I wasn't expecting to like this song.  LOVE IT.  Great job Tom
Tom macDonald is too underrated. Thank you for this song 🙌
Wow just wow this song bro wow ... hit me hard I can relate
My grandma died from cancer in March and my mom fought it two times
#EndCancer
I can't stop listening to it this is a song I needed all my life!!!! Watched my mom start dieing at age 6 and my dad at the same time I took care of my sister she barely made it she was 1.5 lb almost lost my mom at the same time my life was those three people till I said my last good bye to both my mommy and daddy and still right next to my baby sister and glad I could be that person for them!!!
Wow. Great song!
So emotional and very true re: hospitals/doctors etc. It pays to put you on Chemo with very little long term positive results
Lost my father in 2007 to cancer.
damn bro, good shit.
Whoever put a thumbs down to this video sucks
Love this. Spread the love, spread the truth, and help one another stay strong.
Cancer is a terrible disease  My younger sis has a brain cancer and she has almost been suffering from it  For more than 12 years  And in Morocco we call it L'Merd L'kbih = The terrible disease
Thank you. From a 30 y/o single, mother, daughter, sister who is fighting Stage4 metastatic cervical cancer.. thank you for the acknowledgement & LOVE.   From all of us who fight while we're afraid. 💖
Your a amazing artist! I appreciate you. Thank you
I'm am currently fighting stage 4 hodgkins lymphoma and I'm not gonna lie it's the hardest thing I've ever had to do but this song helps me so much. Thank you
I think my heart is bleeding💔 As truthful as ever Tom💯
606,997 last year of cancer !! but it’s all good nothing to C here! Convid 215,000 right now but fake masks u have to we’re that not even OSHA or msha would approved, and Jesus is the way not the world!
Wow this one really hits home. The video, the look on her face when they told her, her parents falling apart, the teddy bears piling up in the room. I've been there. What a perfectly heartbreaking portrayal of what cancer does to families. Tom MacDonald never ceases to amaze me.
WOW!!! This brought tears to my eyes. This is exactly what rap should be, giving hope to the hopeless. Say what you want about Tom Macdonald, he is a good man. A funny one too.
The more I open my eyes .............. thanks for keeping it real Tom
Have always loved your powerful causes, words, and songs, you know what you are are doing, They are Great, and So are you💯🖤🤍💙🧡🙏💪☮
Fxck Cancer RIP DAD!!!
Yo this song touched me.. That's very inspiring yk.. Keep it up Bruh
Sing it man I lost 7 family members from it
My sister in law posted this and I listened and WOW this song hit me so hard I am going through chemo for uterine cancer and the words speak to me so much, the chorus is so meaningful and just well I have no words to explain how it makes me feel, I get told all the time how strong I am and how much of a fighter I am and it is tiring but when he says were all human we keep fighting cause thats how we survive is just so true. Thankyou for this. This song means so much to me as a fighter.
🙏 🌞 beautiful song thank you Tom.  Chills
Deffs heart hitting song.. I felt this song , Great work Tom 💜🤘
Thank you for this video.  I've lost my father, grandmother, a sister and 2 friends to cancer.  Its so scary
I just love you man! I found you like 3-4 years ago by accident and I liked your style. I thought you had “IT” but there was just some little thing missing. And then like two years later that thing was pushed front and center. It was the truth! It was the real, hard to swallow, dead honest, genuine feelings you have! And it fucking made your music so much better. I don’t like to compare but I am gonna...Eminem and Marilyn Manson used to make songs that were hard to swallow. They made people really think. They evoked so much emotion. They were raw, honest, truthful, and that was what made them who they were. The music you’ve been making for the last 3 years has been that type of music. It’s inspiring. My girl used to get so mad cuz I’d say “babe you gotta listen to this dude! It’s finally some real hip hop that I can be excited about. Shit that makes me feel things!” And she’d just say yeah okay. But she heard it too. So after this incredibly long winded rant...I just wanted to say I’m a true fan! This made me cry. Made me think about the talks I’ve had with loved ones about the atrocities of the insurance industry and the government. Thinking about my grandmothers last days with us. My grandfather withering away to 78lbs before passing. And anyone else who’s had to suffer thru this. Thanks Tom! You made a fan for life homie! Blessings and love bro!
It's not the greatest, as I don't have a pc or any of tech, but I felt moved to do a reaction  https://youtu.be/WSj6_bf_CMI
Very Powerful song Tom ❤❤❤❤ it. Love your truth and realness. Your talent is extreme hope you make music for along time bro.
My mom is in ICU with Brain tumor, and today she goes into surgery to have it biopsied. I NEED PRAYERS FOR HER.  GOD BLESS EVERYONE AND TOM THANKS FOR THIS SONG. IT IS MAKING ME FEEL BETTER.  I love you Mom.
Thank you for this 🤗💖
Dude holy fucking shit this hits home so close my dad passed away 2years from cancer I feel this in my bones holy fucking shiit man keep this up straight fire and tears
Amazing video I have felt this all personally as cancer has taken a toll on my family twice before I wouldn't wish it on anyone
Im not trying to be mean but this song is not as good as other songs tom made but a good video expression and beat
Dude....your song is so to the heart....I felt every word...I have lost 9 people, family and friends, to cancer....watched them all go from being strong to putting them in the ground....the song brought tears to my eyes and sadness to my heart...and one would think as much money as we spend on donations and funding that they would be able to make something that can beat the hell out of it...I just think they won't because then they would lose all that money.....LOVE YA TOM, KEEP SPEAKING THE TRUTH MY BROTHER.....GOD BLESS YOU...
Good song man!
Your so smart , intelligent & sooooo incredibly talented 💙
I love this ❤️ thank you so much! My mom died in my arms of cancer in 2000 the hardest day of my life. She beat 2 rounds and lost the 3rd.
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
This hits home. Bless you!
I honestly want to share my experience with cancer  When I was four years old my godmother passed of cancer the very day after her wedding and she found out and wanted to make her last day her happiest, the day of her wedding was really upsetting for me as she was hooked up to something, I’m not sure what (I’m 13 now) and she was in a wheelchair and I couldn’t gather the courage to take a photo with her and that was the last time I saw her as she passed the very next day. I still feel horrible for it to this day and regret my decision.
Guys Dr Richard Raymond Rife CURED CANCERs
Awesome message Tom. Now go get fatville just for the "clout" that he would give you lol. Keep up the real shit. H. O. G. TX.
This really hits home. My mother died 10/13/20, the metastatic brain cancer is what finally got her but she had many forms of cancer over the last few years. Thank you
Beautiful song
A couple of years ago my grandfather passed away from cancer at 77 years old they have him 7 months he mad it 7 years and 4 months my my great uncle passed away by cancer we found out after and my grandmother who raised me most of my life as well I stayed to the end just passed away just over a year ago and I have atleast older family member who have cancer ther are many type of cancers as there are many issue in the world our love support and pure will power we are all on a long road there are many steps but standing together and take each step at a time in bracing life for what it is and what it can be as and as a black white native Italian Canadian that only sees wrong or right by life the point is I feel and I love this song
Man powerful. We are focused on corona virus but the real pandemic is cancer by far. Keep opening people's eyes.
Good message......Lame ass song and lyrics. This guy is whack.
Lost my Grandmother to cancer. Watched her energy drain, will to keep on, drain, hair loss, bills pilling, I was there just hours before she passed. You cant form words in that situation but being there and catching her last few smiles and labored laughs...then I also lost my uncle, he was a heavier truck driver and I watched him wither away from 260lbs to about 100 when he passed. Wouldnt wish cancer on the worst of people.
of course there has been a cure for cancer for years, they'll never let it come out. Just like there are car engines that can run on water and ways to create free energy.
this hits tom, my one of my greatest role models is battling cancer, my grandfather, he's getting worst by the day, take so many different meds to help suppress it but it getting so bad it hurts him to move he has been teaching me things since I was born, from the moment I could walk, and he's fighting harder now, just for a chance to maybe get to see his first great grandchild, and it hurts to see hm laid in bed, not moving, If I could take the it away, I would in a heartbeat, I love that man with all my heart, and I've already lost one male figure and on the verge of another, but we can't let them down we have to stay and this is for everyone that has lost someone close, that's on the edge, keep your head up, make them proud, don't give up and keep pushing for the best you, the you that they saw in you, the you that you don't even see in yourself yet, push yourself, and strong, and love y'all, if y'all are reading this to this point thank you, but do realize while this hurts to write I'm not thinly one going through this spread love to everyone, stop the hate, because I promise its only making things worse, we as humans have a future, and I want y'all to know that there's always some one there for you, just reach out and open your arms, theres always someone to talk to, you just have to reach out to someone  thank y'all, love y'all, and God bless
Damn this shit should be viral
God damn bro, you weren’t lying when you said this song would bring us tears.
You have inspired me man and keep going and you will be the change in the world and I love that keep going never give up and just know a lot of people love you and it starts with one and turns into millions (I cried while typing this)
LOVE
Thanks Tom, I was watching this while outside smoking a cigarette and you made me feel bad for smoking 😂😂
Lung cancer took my dad, and even though we have our "own choices" I have also always SAID well THE GOVERNMENT sells and provides the tobacco and the alcohol & therefore they are killing us and wanting us to buy it and die, we work for them. And I bet the TOP TOP TOP mfers that run our states/ world have had treatments to keep them alive etc or who knows maybe they been cloned or its like something out of the tv show The 100.
This video made me break down and cry missing the family I've lost to this shit and almost lost.  #Fuckcancer
Ever since my best friend died at the age of 16  of an aneurysm caused by agressive brain cancer I started to have problems with processing emotions. i have trouble crying unless it’s a strong wave of emotion, it’s been over 4 years and this video hit me like a freight train. Words can’t describe the thought and emotion that you have made me and thousands of others feel. Tom thank you for being you. Your actions will change many lives and I hope to make a song with you one day.
That's deep...real deep brother.
The world is under the sway of the wicked one
Very powerful message
I’m curious what it takes to be one of these POS that hit the thumbs down button. Tom Macdonald speaks truth and it’s sad. Keep doin you Tom, your true fans will still be here.
1 thing thats AWESOME about Tom & Nova, is that actually care about their fans and support them
This day 5 years ago I lost a best friend to cancer, I miss him everyday
Not sure if he meant it but I lost my mom to cancer when I was 15 and when Tom is there screaming at the end but you just hear the chorus coming through regularly it's how those that are the ones from the outside looking in feel. Watching someone you love fade away or deteriorate in front of you and all you want to do is scream at everyone and everything but have to be calm and strong for them. For those going through it, Stay Strong and take it day by day. For those helping someone go through it, scream when you need to but every moment you have with them cherish it.
Rick Simpson Oil. The cure. Youtube it... There is literally a video of rick himself showing you step by step
Thank you !  Colon cancer fighter and I approve this song to all those who fight beside me in this fight. Amazing I needed this !!!
My mom died when I was ten then my dad at twenty. I lost my dad to colon cancer and he was a smoker who kept his symptoms a secret for four months then was diagnosed for stage 3. When we went to see him in hospice he wasn't coherent but I felt his warm hands on my face and burned the feeling in my memory forever. I reme.ber before he went to hospice two days before hand, I told him he was the best father to me and he didn't hug me back. I think it was the emotions and he didn't want to confess he was weak to me.
Your awesome Tom! Thanks 🙏 for speaking the truth. -2 Geez
My dad got b-cell lymphoma cancer 4 years ago, he was 80 years old, they said, "He's got a while to live, and I was working my butt off trying to save up the money to go visit him in the hospital, me and my wife were going through some money troubles, and we had just visited him and my mom at there house about 3-5 months before he had to go to the hospital, he went into a coma state, and my mom stayed with him the whole time, and I finally got to visit him with the help of friends and family helping us, and I got to see him, but not talk to him because of the coma, and then a week or two after we visited my mom said he was awake and I talked to him on the phone, I was wanting to get back to see him and couldn't right then and I think a week later she said that the doctors are saying he had like a couple days left, and I rushed to where they were, and my mom didn't tell me that he had already died before I got there, I didn't get to see him awake or tell him anything before it happened, I regret that everyday and I went to grief therapy and it helped so much, anyone that is going through something like this, no matter what you think about any kind of therapists, go to a grief one, it will make the world of difference, I promise you. Thank you Tom MacDonald for this, you get more and more respect from me every time I listen to your music!
I just wanna say this; To everyone who's overcome cancer, has cancer, lost subscribe to cancer. You're brave!!!   FUCK CANCER.
awesome
Tom i love that you don't care about rapping about unpopular topics.  I lost my son at 8 years old.  His twin brother just turned 12 alone.   #teamkiel
This is fire Tom... Keep it up man
I actually went through Stage 4 throat cancer 4 years ago.  Cancer free since. A miracle!  I have refused to watch or listen to it cause you said we would cry like a baby, WA WA WA, and I knew I would.  Then that Pastor said he loved it and then posted again he was going to stay tuned. So,  I just listened and I cried.  Knew you were right.  Been there done that! Best ever y'all thanks! Even better than People So Stupid.  Thank you and please tell Nova thank you also.  Y'all truthfully rock!
Dude I love you and your music u and nova keep kicking ass man
The 2.6k who thumbs down bitch made
Wow made me tear up loved you since the beginning tom you've given me hope in these dire times much love man
Cancer does not discriminate.
I thought comments would be turned off cause there's a minor in the video.
That was fucking beautiful Tom. Thank you. Thank you for being such wonderful a strong person. Thanks for being so giving of yourself and wanting nothing in return for it.
I have  been blessed to not have lossed someone to cancer but I feel for those who have I could not imagine what you go through. Family or the victim. And as stupid as it sounds all I can say is stay strong everyone here has your back family friends even stranger
I have tried to avoid this video since it came out... I lost my grandmother to breast cancer 2 months ago and just yesterday I got her last heartbeat shaved in to my head. I miss her, Thank you Tom -Edwin
My grandmother recently turned 70 and she's fighting breast and lung cancer, the hardest thing is explaining to my children why her hair is gone and why she looks so small now, she's a fighter and uses humor to get by,  thank you for this song
Heart felt in all ways I give it to all the people going thru cancer seriously... I lost my grandmother to it and it sucked.... I hope everyone going thru it can fight thru this shit it's a POS
Love to you Tom Jesus is the afterlife!!! Love Love Love your Spirit!!!
This song hits home for me my wife and I just found out that she has ovarian cancer and it's been hard man but 😭😭 thank you man it's all I can say is thank you
😭
Thank you Tom McDonald
My wife's a 2 time cancer survivor. TOM IS SPITTING FACTS! 👏👍💪🙏✌🇺🇸
this song hits home from 2016-2019 i watched my mom(60) both my uncles(50's), my aunt(40's) and grandma (85)all died from cancer.
My husband was just diagnosed with myeloma a week ago. He has two years or less. He will never go into remissions. This song...just...😭
Hey Tom, I am a up and coming Podcaster and I am creating a Pod cast called Passions Pay Profits; I am interested in using pieces of this song because I feel this is an AMAZING song for uplifting people. I believe life for many people can be considered cancerous and it is time we stand together and help one another to be the cure to this madness we call our lives! I would really appreciate the opportunity to use pieces of this song as a intro to my podcast. I am asking directly because of copy right infringement and plus I am a hug fan! Hopefully you will take a listen one day! One love Tom!
Powerful
All those who put a thumb down are so sick how could you.
Thank you so much for this. I lost 2 uncle's to cancer and my aunt battled breast cancer and beat it. This song is really heart felt
The fucked up thing about this is that it caught me in the feels. My mom had cancer (even thought we didn't get along) and my GFs daughter had cancer to and she beat it. So this song is pretty personal and IM NOT CRYING!!! I have onion cutting ninjas hiding somewhere damnit!!!
No words
this song cuts me deep on a emotional level since today is the day i lost someone who i love to cancer. it's hard to sit at work and try to be strong after being told that the person is gone when you just want to sit in a corner and just fucking cry
Thax it’s good they have but  it’s covid19 is not real
We just found out my dad has pancreatic cancer 2 days before this came out. Thank you tom hard times right now. My dads my hero!!!! Life changed in the blink of an eye.
Lost my dad to cancer just wanna say thank you im not much of a cryer but I'm not ashamed to say I am wiping my face dont think I've had a song hit this close to home in a long time thanks man much love keep doing your thing this is what it looks like when an artist is not controlled by the machine
My Dad was just diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer. I felt numb hearing him tell me over the phone. He is on opposite ends of the country, I cant see him, only hear the fear and sorrow in his voice. I clicked on this, expecting another gem, but 30 seconds into it i broke down in tears. I love all Tom's songs, but this one really made a difference.  It helped me process this news, and provided a bit of hope against this future. Thanks man.
Tom you are a beautiful soul my man keep making music fuck the haters
Still grieving the loss of my baby brother, he died years ago from stage 4 neuroblastoma cancer, right before his third birthday when we had the make a wish foundation set up for him, Rip Greyson Tavaris Cardinal🙏
https://youtu.be/aE6DVwHoM4E exactly
I was in tears the first 15 seconds and im not that type. My wife has been fighting cancer for 2.5 years. She is a fighter. Great song. 100% true
Just lost my mom 2weeks ago form stage 4 Brain cancer...I wasn't ready for this one Tom..Damn that hit hArd. Shouldn't have watched this at work, lol
Pretty based, still disagree that scientists and stuff aren't trying.
My condolences to those who are fighting this disease hope you all recover.
Thanks Tom McDonald was amazing
I miss my Mom & Grandma.... It's been 12 years and it still seems like yesterday. #FuckCancer
The song name is his career in a nutshell
We beat cancer and overcome death with believing in Jesus Christ! God bless Tom MacDonald!
Love the video my moms boyfriend is going threw all the dr bs fighting cancer right now your songs bring people hope and bring back the faith everyone needs thanks Tom your the man
Lukimia took my cousin when I was 5... His birthday is next Friday. Well I guess its time again to drive 3 hours to visit him.

Fighting cáncer right now and isnt being a good Day, thanks Tom, from the bottom of my heart.
Good job you two. Definitely a tear jerker.👍 👍
Another Beautifully Meaningful song From Tom MacDonald ❤️
A Meaningful Rap song, once again, Tom, you knock it out of the park!!!!!
Love it
Absolutely amazing,I love your music man 💯💯💯
I've got three kidsI get them to listen to this stuff my youngest which is 6 years old loves this dude's music
This hitting home my grandpa  just got done with radiation
This is the one thing that amazes me about this guy right here Tom McDonald this man takes things that are actually happening in our lives and he makes a positive song about it only if a lot of the other rappers did with him in a very few others do Tom your the greatest of all dude my hat's off to you bud.
The doctor, the actor from White Boy, is awesome please keep bringing him back. Great video!
I’m not going to lie I cry every time I listen to this song. To the people who dislike this song they probably don’t know or haven’t gone through the struggle. Thank you to Tom and Nova for doing this.
Great song plus video as always! Also anyone wanna sub? Would help me a lot and if not just check me out please💙
1 MILLLLLLLL
😭😢🥰😢😭
I'm not the dude who cries, ever....but I tell ya I just watched this for the first time and am crying like the day cancer took my grandfather.
This song hits home with my wife having two surgeries for her thyroid cancer. Thought they got it all the first time and it came back. She is cancer free at the moment
😭 please pray for my dad.
I lost my dad 2 years ago to cancer and I miss him terribly every single day. I would do anything to tell him I love him just one more time.
My dad died of liver cancer when he was 59. I had to deliver the news to him that they denied him for the liver transplant. My heart shattered looking him in the eyes having to give him his death sentence.
Keep up the good work 👍🤙
You out did yourself with this one tom. Goosebumps throughout my whole body everytime I listen Iisten to it and ugly tears when the chorus begins.
The guilt I carry is heavy. The doctors told me the type of cancer I have skips a generation. So 12 years later I had to sit and listen that not only one of my daughter's but the second oldest has the same type of cancer and had to have  the same surgery as me.
How do 2.6k people dislike this song?.. y’all must’ve never lost anyone.
Good job my friend 😢🥰put a tear to my eye❤️❤️lost my grandmother who raised me she died from lung cancer 😢
my girl heard the first bar and literally broke down crying. couldn't even finish the song.
Wow this hit hard lost my aunt to stage 4 cancer and seen her husband drink himself to death cause he couldnt deal with her gone.
Food grade hydrogen peroxide and distilled water. My dad did it after his second cancer surgery. The doctor told him if he didn't do chemotherapy he would be dead in 2 yrs. My dad went to see that dr 3 yrs to the day. The dr said there were no signs he had cancer at all and gave my dad a hug.  Also I eat cilantro, also a cancer fighter.
Love the video Tom, My mom went through stage3 breast cancer and by the grace of God she has beat it. It was the most horrible thing to watch someone that you love go through. Thanks for the video.
Covid,cancer,religion all a money making sham. Its a joke all created by the government
Last blast of chemo as we speak.. 4 weeks left of radiation tongue and throat cancer same shit as eddie van halen . Fuck cancer everyone keep fighting you're stronger then you think.
Same guy from Whiteboy lol (black dude)
Stage4 throat cancer survivor,radiation,chemo,but I'm alive,than you JESUS CHRIST!!!!
This song is amazing..i have leukemia and this song had me in tears and im a 45 yr old man....thank you for the voice and keep up the amazing work...you and nova are what content kids need to be watching and its obviously showing in your numbers that your message is getting across...enjoy the spoils of doing the right thing...let everyone else fight for the wrong things
#Aaliyahstrong ❤️🎗❤️🎗❤️🎗🙏
In the course of 3 years I lost 3 grandparents to cancer. Things happened so quickly I didn’t even really get to process everything going on, I was in high school trying to just get past the extremely awkward teen years we all experience and didn’t realize how serious things were. It’s weird looking back now that it’s been 6 years since I lost my last grandparent and seeing how negatively the treatment impacted them, but when you are so close life has a way of blinding you to what’s right in front of you. Looking back I wish I had been present more, I was so caught up in teenage things that didn’t matter. I didn’t realize that one day I’d give a year of my life just to have one last conversation with them, to tell them how much has changed, get advice, and ask the questions I wish I had asked. Fuck cancer and fuck the doctors that push torture as treatment. None of my grandparents cancer were curable, and they knew it but they insisted the treatment would give them the best shot at an extended life. I have no doubt it cut their lives short and lined the pockets of pharmaceutical companies. They use our fear of mortality to make a deal with the devil. The fucked up part is if I get cancer I’m sure I’ll also opt for treatment hoping I’m the exception. The cycle repeats.
A brother in law of mine, just passed from massive cancer, it was everywhere in his body. Within a month of his diagnosis, he passed away. It kills quick
Absolutely amazing ✨✨ 🙏🏼  Thank you also for my personalised albums they were an honour to receive. Love you Tom & Nova🦋🦋🦋
Damn, this hit different. It cuts deep dude keep it up
"Battling. Fighting, cancer" here and it ain't easy with everything else you have to go through. Fell asleep in the rain in my driveway for 5 hours before some one called the balance. https://photos.app.goo.gl/qjABS3foBvL2SFso6  https://photos.app.goo.gl/QmwWGW7JzC5sucnJ6
Why does this have almost 3 thousand dislikes, whos hating on this?
Its sad the day this came out is the day I found out my great-grand mother has cancer in her lungs, pancreas,  and liver.
How can people dislike this?
Damn...Got me leaky AF
They have a concept for a cure using sound to vibrate the cancer cells at a resonant frequency to rupture them, but that only works for identical cancer cells.
Just going to leave this here https://www.mycancerstory.rocks/single-post/2016/08/22/Shake-up-your-life-how-to-change-your-own-perspective
Being a Nurse on a bone marrow transplant unit I see this everyday. ALL, CLL, AML, CML, NHL, Hodgkins, AA, blackfan anemia, sickle cell, MDS, multiple myeloma, etc. The people I take care of have changed me forever. Live your best life and spend time with family and friends.
Thank you for talking about what people won’t. I have Stage 4 metastatic papillary thyroid cancer. I have had three surgeries in a year, and don’t even qualify for disability.
Cancer sucks and eventually effects everyone somehow, or someway. Love the video❤️
Great Vid man, lost my mom 6 yrs ago to cancer, last yr my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, treatment every 14 days. Thanks for this Tom!
Why are you people disliking this song 🧐 can you just not except the reality or do you not care about the people undergoing these conditions.
This hit home. My grandpa died almost 14 years ago from lung cancer that spread to every organ in his body in the 6 months from when they found it to when he died. And my wife's grandma has cancer for the 9th time at 90. She's not fighting it this time.
Great song and great video keep up the good work
Awesome song ive lost several family members to cancer and I hit it nail on the head with song I love all ur music u r a great artist keep up the good work as long as u keep putti g music out I will keep listening
My dad just died of cancer on the 7th. Its been so rough. Thank you...
Squamous cell carcinoma took my mom when she was 46. Pancreatic cancer took my dad when he was 57. I am only 36 yrs old and cancer took both of my parents. Sometimes I feel so lost and alone. I miss their voices most.. CANCER SUCKS!!
Why is there 2.6k dislikes
A song for everyone.
You won't know how to be brave until you fight when your afraid.
Felt this on a different level.
My gram just passed from lung cancer man it was hard.Thank you for your music its always so inspirational and truthful much love man
Bet the 2.6k 👎 is  all homosexuals! LOL! Awesome song + video LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVED it!
I lost my daddy to non Hodgkin's lymphoma five years ago but before he passed he put on one hell of a fight until the end I miss him so much .. 😞💔  Love this song Tom ♥️
Awesome song, my mom passed from cancer many years ago.  I’m sorry but it looked like a fart was burning his eyes most of the vid
Its songs like this that show your greatness. From stupid songs. To shit so deep like this. Rock on dude. Your amazing.
Keep it up tom
Yay, 1Million views 👌💥👏🙋🎉🧨
its easy... why treat something once when you can make people pay multiple times just to "survive"
Oh dear old chap, it seems I have a leak or two in my face.  One moment
Tom always leaves me speechless with his messages in his music and videos. But this... this hit hard...
All the money in the world does help, well it has helped.. Look at Magic Johnson, he was the first and only person to get rid of Aids..  Do you think that's just good luck or hundreds of millions of dollars he has??? J.S I love this song man!! It hits home really hard.. Keep the songs/videos coming 🎥🗣🎤
RiP to all who pass by dancer
There is no end to this man's talent
Powerful lyrics Tom! Keep the music coming buddy.
Genius
As always, your words speak volumes!!! 💜
There was a Russian man that started to smoke weed when he had cancer and it helped him he stopped taking the meds and just took weed it has some good side effects but ppl what to look at it like a hardcore drug
My granny passed a year ago from cancer ugly disease beautiful song♥️
Powerful message, Tom. Thank you for a song that gives hope.
Love this song ❤️ BIG fan from Australia
Beautiful song put tears in my eyes I lost someone to cancer so it hit home for me
Just lost me mom to cancer on Sep 28 this really hits hard thank you tom
How could people dislike this song??
Don't be scared of death.  It's the same as before you were born.  Not being alive is not being alive.
Just lost me mom to cancer on Sep 28 this really hits hard thank you tom
What a song Tom Macdonald , tell'em like it is  .
Man you made me tear up!!! This hit home as my daughter was diagnosed with a stage 4 cancer at 10 months old and a really good friend of mine had lost his daughter to cancer. F cancer. I am going to share the hell out of this video!
I love it man!
Yo!! This is 100% I mean 100% great song. This needs to be shared far and wide! I cried like a baby knowing people who fought this and survived and also fought and died! TOM keep up this music! You are awesome my brother!!
Love it!!
This is very touching. Your music is so inspiring Tom. Thank you for this one. Felt this one in my heart
I'm a couple days late to this reaction but this is by far one of the more emotional ones (for me at least). My grandpa was a huge inspiration for me growing up taking my my brother and I fishing or catching light bugs in Mason jars and letting them back loose or spending the night and watching him make breakfast in the morning. He got diagnosed with cancer around 15 years ago and honestly I don't know how he fought it for nearly ten years. He always had a smile on his face even when things got the hardest. All the medicine, treatments, and dialysis finally caught up to him that he stopped smiling all the time. Not long after that he started losing his memory and just start talking about random stories of him growing up. It never truly bothered because I just loved listening to him even if I knew what was going on. Not long after he passed away in his bed one afternoon. I remember seeing him just...gone when I saw him in his bed... the one thing I regret the most is not spending enough time with him before he passed. I'd do anything just to spend one more day with him.  Love you pawpaw❤
Wow this is so powerful.  Iv only ever been to 2 funerals in my life time 1 was my daughter and the last one was few weeks ago my anti past she had bowel cancer.  And my uncle also has cancer so this song hits hard . 💔💔 your words are so powerful.  .. xx
I miss my mad..
Man, talk about a song that hits you where it hurts. I watched my mom go through this when I was 17. It took her in just 6 months. Between chemo and radiation "therapy" she lost all of her hair and gained alot of weight, had a mastectomy and still lost the fight. This song made me 😢.  Just brings back everything.  Great song Tom. You are a great artist. Every song you write has a message. Much love. Stay safe, and god bless everyone.
Damn, that was a solid blow to the emotions. You're incredible dude.
How can so many dislike this song ?? They can never have a mother, father, with cancer. My mother passed away a year ago. After more than 60 chemotherapy treatments, and several radiations of one of her eyes .. "Fuck Cancer"
Love all the SUPPORT everyone is giving each other with this message. "Keep Fighting" everyone who is fighting through any illnesses. Love you Tom.🙏
Almost cried
Oof...... at 16 I went through treatment for b cell lymphoma.  I'm 37 now. Thank you Tom you have a lot in this song. Thank you I feel it. Wishing you and your family the best my friend.  James L
Your music touches people the way music has never done before. Serious. Master piece
"Don't give up and know youre strong" -Tom Macdonald 2020
wish all would really listen and understand the words ..they are bang on the money and  really  from the heart, brain and soul huge respect Tom Macdonald
Thank you. So much. 💕
The problem with cancer is it's not a disease. Not like most think of it. It's a mutation in your own body. There's no cure, because there's no "one" cancer to fight. It's a unique battle for each and every person who gets it. Twenty years ago they told my dad he had less than five years to live. Three times it's come back, and he's been helped through it by amazing doctors every time. Never give up on life, we all die some day, but no one has a set expiration date.
Thanks Tom. You always hit a home run.
You still killing it bro. Love your music.
I have no words for how ABSOLUTELY AMAZING this song is!!💯💯💯
Keep the music coming! You are amazing
This hits home...lost 4 family members because of f***ing cancer already, my aunt is battling cervical cancer right now. I'm tired of big pharma...chemotherapy is so fucked up.
I survived cancer at four this song is amazing it was a tumor is my right testicle
😢
What?
Asking all the right questions, focusing the minds with a gentle hand. Your gift is more than just your lyrics. Keep it up. You're 1/(current human population). Obvious, but not. Simple yet complex. It's a delicate balance, yet you do it like it's second nature. Can't wait to see how much you learn in the coming years to add a deeper meaning to all of this if you're still an artist at that point. <3
Charity link anywhere? Otherwise this feels like sad bait
I took care of my step dad that tried to call the self suicide line and talked him out of it when he had cancer. Love that man to death. So I know all too well what your talking about. Love you Tom
I lost my grand dad, my dad, and my best friend from when i was 4years. old till he died of cancer  When i found out he was sick i dropped every thing ro be by his side 4 months later he was in the dirt that day i lost my brother. We were friends from preschool threw collage threw the fire academy. To 9-11-01 where we were their during the attack on the trade center. As paramedics. He got cancer from exposure. Ans i got fucked up lungs.  Even tho he is gone he ia stilll my best friend. I visit him every year on his birthday. . & their is not a day that goes buy i dont miss my brother
I am a cancer survivor. I had cervical cancer at 15 and it was the closest to death experience that really gave me the new understanding of what my life means to me . All I wanted to be was to be and then I made me I'm so proud to be able to see . What I'm trying to say is this .... It's because of tom macdonald and people like him that keep it real and are not afraid to say how it is about what ever it is . I see your love of life and the real that makes you stand up and scream is it just me or am I in a dream . What is wrong with all those wack people that are to afraid to say this is crazy and something just is not right in our world why won't people stand as one and face what's wrong and fix it ? I love what your doing tom macdonald please keep it going I support you and I am you in so many ways . Thanks for saying everything I have always wanted to say . We are one !!!!!!!
much respect, great song
thanks for the song its like a meditation song i like it
The cure is gold dust.  Some Freemasons know how to use it.
A topic that I’m glad you hit 🔥
Tom in his own lane no1 keeping up 💯
Yup
My papa got cancer but he went through kemo he’s still alive though
I don't understand how there is 2.6K dislikes on this song are y'all haters really that ignorant
Yo Tom I love your music mate but please can you make a song with a fire chorus again. I personally dont like what you are doing with the choruses in your songs but your verses are still fire. Miss the songs like "sorry" "every body hates me" "sad rappers" basically I miss the Tom Macdonald before ghost stories came out. But I respect you and will support you none the less. Good luck my dude!!
I cannot even type how  much this song got mr feeling a certain way man. I lost so many people to cancer in my family already, but i just found out my gf of 17yrs has cancer and it makes me wanna die.  This song has helped me so much i dont even understand man. I want to take her place like nose dripping type of shit crying. Im serious. We are out here too, and we love you man. Be all good with your family, and may whatever god you worship bless you with the most kindness man. I hope one of the helps me brother.
Tom. You're a hero I'm not sure if you know that or if anyone told you that...but you are truly something special and there aren't enough people like you in the world, we love ya man.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 it is so sad 😭😭😭😭😭😭WHY!!!!😭😭😭😭☺️
There is this song That I made up in my head That I thought It would sound Good With Somewhere your Rapping In it
damn. this really hit home for me, my mom had cancer she survived, I thought I would never see her again, I thought the visits I gave her were my last, I thought I lost my mom but she's here today and still fighting. I love you mama❤
This is my favorite song I don't know what my second favorite is You're my favorite rapper And I Wish I could Hang out With you
So deep.. thank you
😭😭😭😭
that doctor's eyebrows gave me cancer. wtf?!  love the song tho
Beautiful man. I'm 4 years cancer free. ❤️💪 It sux fr.  🙏🙏 Hope it stays away for good
To those that didn't make it we salute! 🙏🍻🥂🥃 The tragedy of living is that we'll die...hopefully not today but a day we all will.
“but it’s scary because we don’t know where we’ll go when we die” wow..
I lost both my mother and father in 2018 when I was 27 this song hits hard, but it's a great track!
My favorite uncle passed away from cancer 5 years ago this past august. My stepmom passed away almost four years ago from her third round round with cancer. My grandad has been battling a mild form of skin cancer for several years now. My best friend’s wife had a double mastectomy to stop hers. One of my coworkers just found out a couple weeks ago that hers is back in her one remaining lung. This song means a lot Tom. Thank you.
I still wonder y they count him as the worst rapper's..... but i'mma rock wid him till the end💯💚
Thanks for this heart touching song
All I can really say is just damn my grandmother had breast cancer and she survived I lost my grandfather from a type of cancer I forget which one but it was around my birthday in March. This song hits different
My brother had cancer and I just got tears
Wow simply amazing Tom MacDonald!
Our leaders are good of creating diseases and viruses but can't create a cure nor  clean the oceans full of plastic stupidity over intelligence
Tom you are so awesome! I know this song and struck cords with so so many! It is a great FIGHT SONG! Peace to you brother! We need many more like this in these TIMES!! Keep on keeping on! 🇺🇸🙏💪💯🗽
Hey Tom  The song cancer is a very big song that touches every part of my life and for what I have gone through I have lost my grandparents to cancer and it is still hard dealing with it everyday but  knowing that im not alone does bring me hope for brighter days and happiness So whenever I hear this song it brings me a little bit more hope and joy to know that there are others who feel the same as me and who has probly went through the same as losing somebody to cancer like i have thank you for waht you do and by believing in the truth and being there for us when we are so low there is no getting up i play your music every time I start to feel low as dirt but you words and you  Attitude you portray in your song helps me get out of the funk that I have been in you and everything you do helps give me   Purpose to try to dig myself out of that hole thank you so so so much for all you done and am still doing  ❤
My momma is stage 3, they just caught it early this year. She's had multiple surgeries related to her eventual diagnosis. She's completed chemo and radiation is ripping her body 😭 but she's doing it for my kids, to have a chance to see and be with them. My father has bladder cancer, chemo was so painful he said he'd rather die of cancer than suffer through treatment. My grandfather has prostate cancer and he is in the end stages. He refused most treatment due to how it made him feel. My step mom died of lung cancer, hell my dog died of cancer.
When the revolution starts , Tom Macdonald songs will fuel the fire 🔥
With my wife finding out 6 weeks ago she had cervical cancer ,which took her mother when she was 17, this video and song just wow is all I can say.  We are in week three of chemo and radiation with three more before next scan to see the progress and we both needed this. With tears flowing I thank you and Nova for continuing to create inspirational and powerful music. Never change. You two are such beautiful people who have a major impact on so many lives across the world. Also loved my hangover gang merch and signed cds that came in. Hate that October’s show in Nashville got canceled hopefully soon you guys can come there. We both can’t wait to see our first live performance of you all. Stay safe and never change or stop what you’re doing #hangoverGang4life
Such a beautiful song man. Thank you. Hearing something like this gives me hope that someday a cure will be found. I lost too many family members due to cancer. My aunt, mother. Grandma, and grandpa. Watching my mom struggle when I was 16. To watching both of my grandparents slow fade away last year. It's been a hard life but music like this helps me continue on for those who left. Thank you Tom.
This pulled my heart strings here brotha lost my mom to that crap tom check me out on the gram @rhec.family
Watching this video again! Thanks Tom! Keep up the good work
Keep talking facts Tom. Swear to God this man only spits truth. 💯💯
Wow this is good
Quit eating overly procecessd foods and go back to bathing in a creek...what's sad is people that don't drink and smoke have epidemic cancer did you ever think about that! Even the water you bathe in has been run through a chemical treatment plant....forget what you wash with....all made from the same conglomerates that are telling you that they are fighting for a cure. Same companies profiting on a bandaid for that illness while they are responsible for creating it. Make a video about that Tom! #peoplesostupid
Matrix sellin problems. 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
This hits close to home after losing my gpa to cancer and my aunt to cancer last week 😔
Aight so fine. I’ve been low key listening to nothing but this dude since hearing “I hate hip hop” 2 weeks ago. I’ve been joking around with my friends and co-workers. “Yeah check out this idiot. Hilarious songs. Whiteboy rap.” Secretly been rocking the entire catalogue, feeling deeply about all of it.   Then this... song...  So fuck it. Yeah 100% in. No irony. No jokes. Thanks Tom! Sorry to just be hearing you, but glad I’m here now. Dropping cash on merch today and I don’t even own a CD player anymore.
I love the reaction vídeos to this song
I love your community posts never stop those
Honestly having cancer would suck but atleast if its terminal i would know roughly how long i have and how i would go and not knowing that is one of my biggest fears..
I wish i could have showed my ganpa this a month ago
After losing RBG and Chadwick, this song hits hard ❤️❤️❤️ Tom Macdonald is a GOAT no cap
I CRIED MY SON IS A FIGHTER HE HAS KIDNEY FAILURE AND HE LOVES YOUR MUSIC HE IS A FIGHTER A SURVIVOR  THANK YOU, Tom McDonald
Finally one on spotify I'm gonna loop this for days !
SHARED❣❣❣
My dad passed in 1 month from Being diagnosed .... Thank you for all your heart and soul that  Went into song🙏🙏🙏
Thank you for this
Wow typing this is harder then I thought I lost 5 my mom, aunt, both grandpas, my bestfriends dad all to cancer and all within 2 weeks  8 yrs ago. I am currently trying to help my hubby's dad with stage 4 colon cancer. Its giving me PTSD but I'm fighting for him anyways I can. Mentally im done I've checked out. I HATE cancer with every cell in my body!! I hate the way it steals the souls of its victims, I hate everything it does. Why dont we have a cure or SOMETHING SH!T!?! I have more questions then answers and that PISSES ME THE FU#K OFF! FU#K YOU DEVIL! YOU CAN TAKE YOUR EVIL TRASH AND KEEP IT IN HELL WHERE YOU BELONG! all cancer fighters, survivors and caregivers (families etc..) stay blessed, stay strong, be brave and NEVER EVER GIVE UP!
This is such a lost song. Your words are all over the place. You put a young girl in your video.. while you talk about adult issues leading to cancer. This entire song and video is pile of shit. You are trying anything to appeal to people. It’s sad.
They will never make a cure for some diseases, because they benefit from selling drugs. This is so heartbreaking and the ELITE don't care about other human beings, they only care about money and power.
My mom fought breast cancer from 2000 to 2011 they paid the big money and beat it than came back and the cancer treatment of America told her she wasn't sick enough and she ended up dying in 2011 I wrote them and sent her obituary and said is she sick enough now for y'all to help.. she always had a smile on her face and fought till the end and she lived everyday like it was her last day.. forever remembered Joannie Graham 03/27/2011
I've lost 2 people who I basically considered my moms who battled with cancer, this song makes me miss them a lot tbh
Lip sync. Not for me
Paul Allen just passed away not to long ago from Cancer & he was 1 of the RICHEST MEN in the World. That says it all.  #releasethecure
We’re getting a long ways but we need more funding. Children only get less than 4 percent of funding. There are over 200 types, no one size fits all cure
I lost my pen pal to lung cancer
I lost my dad to cancer and childhood cancer hits close to me.
I was 10 when I lost my best friend my older brother was my hero. I have so much respect to everyone who fights this horrible decease keep your head high we are playing for you all
There is something after this, it’s eternity. As a believer/follower of Jesus I am beyond thankful for the hope I have in Him(God) and my eternity after. For me and my fellow Christians (brothers and sisters in Christ❤️) we have this hope and live for it—not this world. And it’s a hope that anyone can have upon the realization that you need a saviour. We’re all doomed to hell because of our awful sinful natures, everyone, unless you humble yourself before a good, and very holy God who sent His son to lay down His life to rescue all, all who would believe and trust in Him. It doesn’t have to be the end. This is Satan’s world for now, and in the meantime God is being patient and calling everyone to repentance so you too can be saved. ❤️ love you all, and there is hope

Tom is a legend in the making
😭😭😭😭
There are "cures" for cancer but they cost 100s of thousands, like cellular regeneration/replacement. Even then there's a chance it'll come back because the problem is in the DNA
Well said, 💕
you got a big heart tom.  cancer research makes wayyyy too much money to cure it.
this song is the only song by you that my girl will tolerate and I think it made her a fan she lost her dad to prostate cancer bout 4 years ago.
Before the pandemic happened, I found out my grandpa is suffering from agent orange due to him fighting in Nom when he was younger, and has cancer from it. Just 3 months ago we found out my uncle had cancer, but he started to do better. A couple weeks after that my mom was diagnosed with cancer. On 9/11 of this year my uncle passed away from his short battle with it. Last week we found out that my mom's cancer is stage 4. It's in her brest, lungs and pelvic bone. This year can get fucked. And fuck cancer
Dude much love from my family to yours crew much love from pa brother keep it up 😕🤘💕💕💕💕🔥💯🤘👍😭
I like Tom, but sometimes he just needs to learn more about the subject... The video is full of misinformation from a talented guy.
Bad ass song man for sure. Huge truth in this, I've had 2 brain surgeries and you learn some bravery going through cancer
Great song and if people don’t like it , it’s because the haven’t had to go through it or have to take care of someone that has it. Cancer is bad even if it’s not you that has it
2600 people who disliked this work for pharmaceutical industry. Why dor any other reason would anyone dislike this song? I mean really???🤷🏾‍♀️
We need to protect Tom Macdonald by all means. Tom you are always touching the topics noone else does. And those topics can get you killed.. you exposed so many things illuminati do and this song you exposed BIG PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. they have cure for everything but it's better for them to keep us on medication for life than to give us one time cure 🤷🏾‍♀️I love the fact you exposing all this but please be careful...you are a one man army going against the big army of the unholy ones. I salute respect and love u for that. I hope they dont dare to try to harm you... Always in my prayers 💖🙏🏼😊 @irena_the_artist
Never knew Tom was this good. Sorry for misunderstanding 😐
I had stage 5 kidney cancer when I was three I am now thirteen I went through 27 rounds of chemotherapy and ten rounds of radiation i think I don’t really remember that much
If u are sick or have cancer and reading this, just know that someone is praying you can fight it and beat it..if you lost someone to cancer like I lost my grandpa, know they are surely in a better place because this world is living hell..stay a fighter stay a survivor.  I love you.🙏🏼💖
I’m a survivor of leukemia cancer  stage 4  the last one. I shouldn’t  even be here but Thank God that he blessed me and heal me. A couple weeks the doctor told me that They took one year from my chemo 🙏🙏🙏🙏 this music is gonna be in my playlist for sure. Thank u and God bless all of u
I spent the night with my little brother, who's been deteriorating all day and will probably be gone in the next day or two. Up until this point, I've done a lot of time reading up on childhood cancers, learning how screwed up it is, like how only 4% of the NCU's money goes to it apparently. I discovered this literally 5 minutes after my little brother fell asleep when looking around on youtube. It hit me different. Thank you.
Well I've had alot of people around me die of cancer and it seems to me, once they discover they have it, it progresses. Some survive and some dont. Biopsy is sometimes the worst thing because alot of times thats when it spreads. Although I did not cry, I felt every word and they sit heavy in my heart. Well done Tom. Very intense without being intense cuz I've seen how intense you get calling out haters
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE COULD DISLIKE THIS SONG, KEEP RAISING THE BAR BRO. WE LOVE YOU MAN!
Congrats on the million views my brother, I think this one deserves it as well as the great teamwork that worked so hard to create it ...much love and it's ok to tear up and feel it my man, no worries ...that's just compassion & sympathy from the heart ...Had to drop by again for like the 50th  ..lol to listen a few more times...helps me cope with the loss of my father from cancer and it also helped my sister feel the love we all have for those in that fight, jerks a tear out of me every time it's normal though If this song doesn't at least make someone tear up for a second on this one. they might want to go check if their hearts still there IMO ..just saying ....hangovergang4life! in all honesty, if Facebook had a pin option it would be pinned forever on my thread. I haven't even played my guitar since my father passed in 2015  this one brought that fire back in me ..inspired me my man "talent like that don't just come from out of thin air "that's just heart from deep down inside your soul.  I'll be honest now I have a hold of myself but to watch someone fade away like that hurts so much I can't explain it.. my brother was here with him till I and my mom moved up here to Ohio to be with him because he called us and said my brother just wants his life insurance money and everything he owned..so I traveled with my mom to kinda watch after my dad.. mom was right beside me to take care of him as I worked then I would take over after she went to work in the am helped him to his doc appointments and such.. he didn't want to get chemo but one day his mind changed...I think he thought he could beat it and bounce back .not 100% sure on that though, one day we took him to talk to a doctor about it and he wasn't in the condition to get it IMO he was sick from the flu at that time and I said ..dad, you think that's the right thing to do, he thought for a second I could see it in his eyes ..he just nodded so we let him go through with it.. 3 days later my mom woke me up at 2am said he couldn't get back to bed and he fell on the floor in the bathroom... I couldn't even pick him up he was so heavy with fluids on his stomach and body so I had to let him lay in my arms ..my brother come over and didn't do shit just watched in fear and astonishment...I think it spooked him, so I held him in my lap and said everything is going to be ok, told my mom ..to go call the hospital 5 days later on vent he never made it back home.  My brother couldn't even stay by his side as he let go, we prayed over him and that was the last time I saw him. it hurts so bad but I feel I need to get it out to someone before I break and do something stupid ...5 years and it's still fresh in my head tears me up on the spot I couldn't help him and it tor me apart ...I do appreciate you my bro that's something that has been on my mind for so long now my sister is going through it and I can't even speak with her for very long before I start to cry like a little baby. I know what it does and I fear seeing it again thank god she has a great husband to be there he has been by her side from day one ..so I get the skinny through him for right now cause that just blows my mind ...I love her but I can't watch it again tear a life apart ...just thought I needed to get that off my chest...thanks bro that helps, don't get me wrong I just needed time before I could express myself  some may say "hey" grown men don't cry but I fkn did ...I didn't know my dad for 25+ years he was a drunk and my mom and he just separated when I was 5yrs old..he was lying to us and said he didn't have it that bad but that call came in I was "39 at the time" and I jumped in my truck and left FLA with only my suitcase of clothes ..and my mom with hers, moved in with him so I could really get to know him before it took over ..it was a blessing to get to know your father you really never seen in a long time but it devastated me when he passed, long story I know but like I said I needed to let it out and stop holding on to the anger and resentment from not at least giving him a chance to talk with me I had hard feelings for no damn reason ...I'm very thankful I had the time that I did with him.
A well warned 1M views in 2 days. This is so close to home. My uncle just got diagnosed with stage 4 carcinoma with a brain and lung mass after being checked diagnosed with covid. Its bit looking good but this video gives me hope. And sometimes hope is more powerful than anything else
I love you tom this hit every string
Lost my grandad to bowel cancer 20+ years ago. I miss him and his stories so much. To everyone going through this stay strong with love.
Am I the only one crying? I don't know anybody with cancer but I know that every word in the song is true it made me cry so much Tom MacDonald you're so inspirational and motivational I hope you can continue to make music for a long time to come for new generations to listen to Quality music thank you for this it's really really made me crying🙁
Every single word it's so accurate so so true keep spreading the word of the truth because you are helping so many people to wake up up now our days a lot of people are just walking Zombies like robots brainwashed they need to hear music like this and maybe they will wake up and it's just maybe..  keep the faith that's all we can do we can keep the faith they will wake up  God bless you for making these songs😊🙏🏼
Keep the truth coming Tom. We love it!
My mom ❤️ is a 2x cancer survivor and I woke her up the morning this song dropped screaming to listen to the song ...we listened to it and cried ...THANK U SO MUCH TOM&NOVA💔
Tom you're a legend and the best out there. Nobody works harder than you do. Thank you what you do for us all. Keep making meaningful music!!! HOG
My fiancée died from leukemia and lymphoma. He beat CLL and six years later, he developed Lymphoma in his lungs and his liver.  I watched him die in 3 months in hospice. Signed his DNR on my birthday. Cancer sucks, but I don’t think they are hiding a cure. Cancer is a general term and there are so many types of Cancer. There is no ONE cure. Good luck to you fighters out there. And family too. 💪🏻❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤍🖤
Damn wow oh MacDonald you're just getting better and better and and the moment I think you reached your peak you surprise me me by making Even Better song just like this one all I can say is big respect and much love of all the way from London UK I hope we can see you here soon once this Corona thing is over and you can have your concert here one love for you you and lovely Nova😊🙏🏼🥰
My dog has diabetes and cancer and back leg problems and a bladder infection and she’s not feeling good I am sad.
I lost half my family 4 years ago to cancer. Thank you so much for this song. Helps me keep my strength to keep going.
The CURE is built into the body already:   research Max Gerson - Gerson Therapy  50% cure rate for terminally ill patients.  Personally witnessed a family friend overcome his 3mo death sentence when he got terminal brain cancer in his early teens... Cancer free and alive to this day just because his mom took the initiative to buy the book, do the research, and seek out a facility. All I did was make her aware that this EXISTS - solutions exist.... Elevate the ALTERNATIVE to escape this artificial box they've designed.  Look up DR. S3Bl and his proven techniques to CURE more than 72 other devesating illnesses using the human body, mind, and supported with a rebalanced diet and internal chemical composition.  This is not rocket science... Its initiative and a lot of shit shoveling to get to whats real underneath all the knockoffs and fraud out there that offers treatment for symptoms alone. YOU are the solution WE are the solution... We have final say in the daily decisions that give these corrupt corporate giants their power and if we do not exercise them we will continue to loose them.   Decide to be healthy and to spread knowledge of true health... Ask questions, be curiously skeptical with a foundational understanding that biology can restore biology without artificial additives.
Nothing but love for you man, the realist rap artist out here these days.
My sister died at age 5 from leukemia in  2010.
I love you Tom! Absolutely beautiful. Thank you so much!
Tom is always saying the things that most ppl think but won't say. Inspirational. He makes a harmonic masterpiece while dropping truth bombs.
Man this song deserves to be on awareness and donation commercials
I lost my Aunt to Pancreatic cancer four years ago. She did a long treatment and went into remission.  It came back a year later and we lost her six months later. She was our matriarch. She was out source of knowledge, wisdom, and everything you didn't want to hear; but needed to. Three months later my uncle's was diagnosed with bone cancer in his hip. Died a month later. My other Aunty stepped forward and led the family in our times of trouble. She has been there for my mom's own health problems, and the rest of our family's mental health problems, including mine. She was diagnosed with cervical cancer 2 years ago, and went into remission. It just came back. My family can't escape cancer. It feels like it is targeting my families leaders. My mom is the only one that hasn't been targeted yet, but I worry for that call every day.  My family has came closer with everything that has happened. It may kill us, but it will never beat us. Fuck Cancer!  Thank you Tom Thank you Nova
I watched a lot of my family members battle off  cancer my mom had thyroid cancer she didn’t know she was going to live beat it she told me when the doctors put her under she had a dream about her grandma and she said it’s not your time to go it’s been idk how long but there’s no sign of it coming back for her.   After that happened my grandfather was diagnosed with lung cancer he smoked a little when he was younger stopped in his 20s but he was a bookie at a bar helped people who he loved and cared about made sure people were taken care of but always around second hand smoke and it got to him he struggled badly with it. To where I thought he was going to die from cancer but he beat it by the grace of God he beat it and then it was God who decided he shouldn’t have to fight anymore and that he’s tired and belongs some where else but I was happy to at least get 2 more months with him before he passed I’m grateful for that I just miss him he was my role model my idol someone I wake up everyday to become
Hey tom been here sence the beginning...lost my grandmother to cancer she lived a long life till 95 but went down hill quick the hardest part is watching those last 6 months...and I've struggled with depression and anxiety my hole life keep on living and moving forward we are soldiers!!!
This made me cry i dont have cancer  but ive been dealing with  end stage kidney disease since i was 5 (28 now) and hearing this gives me hope that i keep fighting ill get my perfect kidney. Thank you for your music and yes we all are fighters ❤✌
I hear ya. I lost my ex to cancer. You would think after all these decades they would find at least one cure for cancer
Cancer thrives in an acidic enviornment but cannot survive in an alkaline enviornment. So who to trust? Corrupt companies serve acidic oxidizing crap products with more side effects than results. "Paying them to kill ourselves"... facts Tom. Youre a blessing brother 💛   P.s. When you die the FED cash out on the insurance policy they put on you at birth. because most dont know commercial law and how to apply it for emancipation this will continue to be the theme. Follow the money 😉
At first I thought this was gonna be a conspiracy song but no it's just a how the fuck haven't we figured this out yet song one of your best Tom keep it up
I've been growing my hair out for locks for love. Can anyone here help me find where I can find how to donate.
Beautiful message
Wow I'm sure ao many people around the world feel this in their bones. To think this is one of the weekly songs/videos for Tom. Our health is all we have.  Be greatful....for what you think is small is the world to another.
💜💕I love this..i cried..you just r the best tom
You are a voice once for yourself. Now you have become giant warrior for the weak.  Hope and pray that your voice cry’s out for all the defenseless in the world. My you be blessed. A man become great with a voice but when that voice is used for others he becomes a GIANT.
Shalom this is a uplifting video,it will keep your spirits  up in the trenches of this cruel cruel world.
You ever check out Kydd before
Is this just to raise awareness or is somebody who is close to you suffering from cancer ? Or is this all metaphorical
My wife has prostate cancer 😕
Thank you Tom, Nova. 🕊❤️
Just throwing it out there- the Nazi experiments helped propel medical science at an astronomical rate....
Thank you for giving people strength to keep fighting. My family has lost two mothers to cancer. One to breast cancer and the other to pancreatic. They fought hard and I'm sure that they would have been proud to hear your words of strength. Bless you and your family.
Beautiful song it makes me cry everytime I listen. When I was 2 I was diagnosed with chronic heredity pancreatitis which then became pancreatic cancer. I had to deal with all of that till I was 15 when I had surgery which honestly saved my life. I'm still to this day with all the Bill's and everything and I refused to do all the chemo and radiation because I didnt want to pump it in me. I remember the constant nights of pain and even for god to just end it all but I have my health and that what matters. Thank you so much Tom for this song Much Love <3
Can't tell you enough how much I love your music. This song right here tho. It's a great song. Your fucking amazing
3 years ago I lost my great grandmother to breast cancer and ever since the last time I saw her I just wish I could have spent more time with her. But she's in a better place now watching over me and my family as we all pull ourselves together through this madness.
Christianity is true.
I cried. I had MASC cancer (hopefully had), my father died of cancer, my grandfather died of cancer, my friend went through 3 bouts of breast cancer.  This song means the world to me. Thank you.
My dad died of cancer this song touched my soul
I wish i could cry from this. I lost my hero to cancer 17 years ago and everyday is still a struggle. Amazing video Tom.
The strongest person in my life my Uncle who i lived with since i was two year's old & practically helped raise me along with my mother(his sister) & he got diagnosed with terminal Brain & Lung Cancer that spread throughout his entire body not long after his diagnosis from the day he was admitted in to the hospital via ambulance for having multiple cancer related Strokes he died exactly #29 whole day's later! at only 47 year's old! that felt like someone straight ripped my heart out & threw it infront of an oncoming train! My life hasn't mattered much at all a since that & then when my Mom died two year's ago my life meant & means absolutely nothing to me! it takes everything i have out of me to wake up every morning & not follow through with killing myself!... i feel all so alone in this world!...
Please watch 'The truth about cancer video by global quest' it has 2 episodes and they researched the pharmaceutical companies all the way back to when it all started and also shows you why we all think of natural medicines as a hippie thing it's not by accident, they are hiding so much and this documentary brings it all to light.
I watched my uncle die in a hospital bed while his two little girls get adopted by some random people... I miss him more and more everyday.. love you uncle. Your resting easy now...
Did Fantano send out his sycophants to dislike bomb even _this_ song? He truly is an ugly person on the outside and the inside.
This is the first time I listen to your music and I'm impressed incredible song I myself lost my grandma to cancer a year ago it's tough thank you for making this you got a new subscriber and thumbs up 🔥🔥🔥🔥👍
Respect
Hopefully my daughter wakes up and realizes mom’s sick and needs her! Cancer Sucks! I’m restarting my battle the 26th after we get results from my biopsy I’m having tomorrow. Sometimes I feel so alone! I’m Thankful I have my son’s family however I really want my daughter involved with my treatments and she refuses!
Wow 🥺 absolutely resonates. Been in remission for 29 years and I'm 35 still fighting strong very inspiring tom geez... Song of the millennium #done. wish you'd give me permission to play this on my live stream intro facebook copywrite issues in all but amazing
This song is amazing, I expect nothing less from you. Sending prayers and love to everyone who is fighting cancer and your support team.
no shit chemo kills you quicker
"we're paying them to kill ourselves" never thought of it that way 🤯
I know how to cure cancer  this is truth 18687455990
Really makes me miss the family I've lost to cancer. Two of which passed when I was 6 and never got to know😢 R.I.P Grandpa and Grandma Zoog and Teresa Yocum you are never forgotten. Thank you Grandpa Sanford for being a strong, tough soldier in your battle and making it through 3 rounds of cancer, you are truly awe inspiring! Love you all
Ugh took my 1st love. My grandfather, my step dad,  and so many more... my 1st love was testicular cancer. My grand father was brain cance. And my step dad was  lymph node cancer..
I'm speechless 😶
My kids dad had bone cancer at the age of 24 he beat it after doing all the treatments he's been in remission for 15 years now.  Great song
Tom McDonald you are by far the most influential artist I've ever heard.  Everything you speak is truth, every emotion you express is felt,  every topic relevant to everyone.  You say the things people are afraid to say,  but need to be said.  I have only been listening for a few months bro but you got a fan for life.  Can't wait to see what's next!!!
Cancer took two of my aunts within a year of each other. Thank you for this song sir. Your words are strength and truth. They both fought it until their last breaths.
Who else's more lov this song
Sometimes there are no words. 😢😢😢
Only ones who can get cures are billionaires same with aids its sad so many deaths when there could have been lives saved
I lost my both my great grandmas to cancer and 2 of my uncles i miss them this song hits home thank you for this tom
This literally brought tears to my eyes. Such a talented artist.
My mom had ovarian cancer and only lives on because her friend spent the money on the surgery. My mom would have died within a few weeks if not for her friend. Im jist terrified it will be worse and come back
I know this won’t get attention but I am currently 10 years old at the moment but I wanna tell you when I had cancer back when I was about 1-2 years old, It was scary and I feel like I was going to die but my parents did almost everything to save me and I was on stage three. Neuroblastoma was the type of cancer I was dealing with and I am know a survivor today.  The hospital I was treated in was Cook Children’s Hospital located Fort Worth, Texas!
Soo loving this,  u rock!!
Thanks for this, 5yrs ago today I started treatment for cancer and now I'm cancer free
Damn Tom you did it again man I can't say it enough your music is so true to life and for many of us its just what we need.. love this and have shared it to my FB so my friends that have fought or currently fighting Cancer to have a listen. Cancer seriously sucks. Thank you again man for yet another great song.
If you dislike this you are a price of crap because you don’t like what the mans believes don’t dislike a video about cancer
My dad was sent home with hospice. He later kicked hospice out.  Went back to doctor. He was cancer free. He went from last stage of lung cancer to cancer free. He said I just said I am not dieing, asked god to save me! He said hospice wanted me to die!
Just losty stepmom from cancer, my little sisters are devistated. Im 23 and have lived enough for it not to hot me as hard but i feep so bad for them girls man...
Remembered my mom messaged her on messanger even though i know no ones gonna reply...😢😇
I lost my mom to cancer in 2015
I never comment on videos but I truly needed this.. my mom was recently diagnosed with lung cancer, bone cancer and brain cancer all at once. I'm only 21 and I have no idea what I'm going to do without her.. seeing her become less and less healthy is breaking me. Thank you for this 💪❤
Great song. So true what you say Tom. Millions of dollars and research and still we cant cure cancer.
I've been listening to your music for about 3 and a half years now and to this day I believe you are so underrated, your music is art man god bless
Lung cancer took my dad June 15 2020
Keep grinding strait bars all your songs are lit
They don't need to make it, it's been out. People are brainwashed and don't study.
My mom had breast cancer. Now she is 100% cancer free. I love this song❤️
Depopulation. Stone hinge. Theres a reason why we have all this bs today. Elites want to stay in control.
This is deep, perfect
Damn.. Im lost for words yet again Tom and Nova. I don't think a song has made me emotional and appreciate things so much from understanding and relating to this song in my own way. Thanks I needed to hear this and im sure a lot others did to keep it up love your music.
Amen
........wow.........just......wow........ great job tom...
My family has 2 killers and that's cancer and suicide, the message in your music is incredible. I've never battled addiction but I have serious depression and fear it will take me out some day. I appreciate what you do for everyone man. You probably won't see this but your music means a lot to me and keep up your positive messages for everyone. Thanks Tom
Thank you this song helps I just lost my 2 year old nephew two weeks ago to cancer! RIP little man!
Yer I'm crying. Thinking of my family. Pop. An my aunty. Love youz so much. Still a beautiful song Tom.
My grandmother battled cervical cancer and my mom fought thyroid cancer and both cancer free has brought tears to there eyes!!!!
Is Ronnie Radke too cancerous?
Good shit Tom.
This song man... it's beautiful. I don't actually know anyone who has cancer, but I've seen what it does to other people who know someone who has it. It's a devastating thing, and to anyone who is dealing with it... please keep fighting, we're all here for you. We got your back during this fight, You're not alone.
I lost my big brother at 29 because of cystic fibrosis I know it’s different but I see the fight they go through an it’s very upsetting I miss him a lot an this will be three years this Christmas I will be with out him.  Tom keep up the great music maybe is you see this I hope you could make something outta a song about all the kids that have fought cystic fibrosis 😢
The more we refuse to allow natural selection, the more health issues we all will collectively have.
For all y'all that's tryna dissect Tom's music and talk smack about the guy and drag him down. Guess what - You can complain as many times as you want, call his music "Pop" and say it ain't Hip Hop.   You aren't gunna stop him from making music anymore than you can stop it from raining. This Tom MacDonald dude ain't gunna debate with you in the comments. Any smart independent artist doesn't care enough to argue with you in some toxic little pocket of the YouTube comment section. They just make their music, release it to the public and MOVE ON.   He ain't gunna show up and validate you or argue with you. Any smart artist won't. The only people you gunna get to argue with you in the comments is other fans, and if they are smart they won't waste their time arguing with you either. But trolls gunna troll... y'all need your negativity fix like it's a crack pipe. You see something nice or positive and you can't resist wanting to tear it down and degrade it.   Tom isn't gunna read your opinion and validate it - he doesn't care if you don't like his music or you think he's a cornball.   If you dont like Tom go listen to Lil Pump, or Smoke Purp, or Playboi Carti or whatever half-ass 8 grapes in ya mouth Dirty Sprite mumble garbage it is that y'all like.   This man ain't gunna take time out of his day to defend himself against you. He too busy on the grind and doing his thing.
Now this is a great track man. It hits you right in the heart and speaks up about something we should pay far more attention to.
As someone who has done cancer research and is going into the medical field I will say that we don’t have a cure. And it’s a hard thing to cure. And there are lots of promising options that we can’t test because we don’t know what it will do to people.   But I’m not going to sit here and defend all the companies and doctors making billions from how we run things now either. If the doctors and corporations we were giving all our money too actually put it to good use us researchers would have the dang thing gone already.   Don’t give up hope on better treatments. And don’t lump every cancer researcher together. They are plenty out there making real advances in immunological cancer treatments that will make chemo look like a ridiculous decision.   That all said. Don’t give up. And keep fighting. Your will to survive is what dictates in the end. And you can survive. Thank you Tom for again putting hope and truth to a tough issue. And I’m praying for those of you battling cancer and for your loved ones as well. Keep fighting
Yup....I cried.
This song made me cry you are amazing and to anyone who feels like they can't handle it anymore never give up if you try hard enough there will be something waiting around the next corner all you need to do is keep trying to reach it
My dad died this year march 20 well basically march 19 st night and I woke up to my mom crying I say what is going on. Mom. Dad died last night and I was broken thank you Tomorrow this means a lot to a lot of people including me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You're a hero, and so is every fighter out there that just wants to live and love. Thanks again, brotha. This is what love is made of.
I'm going to make a cure. I have motivation to fix the problems in this world. I will make it cheap so everyone can get help. I will save this world. We all need help in any type of way. I will help, I want people to live, I want to make this world better. I want everyone to know this now. If I end up on tv you'll know it's me. You'll know who saved your life and you'll appreciate it and so will I. I hope everyone sees this. LETS SAVE THE WORLD!!!
Thanks for this bro! Lost my dad over 8yrs ago to this junk. He had 1 treatment of chemo and his body couldn't fight it. I wasn't able to be there when he passed and there are many times I wish I had one more moment, one more hug, one more  meal one more..... Certainly thankful for the many years we had together and that he is in a much better place and that he didnt suffer much but....life hasn't been the same. Thanks again for your heart and putting this out there! I'm sure it was tough. Much love and respect!!
Gth
Tom MacDonald is the only musician to give me cancer through his music
God bless you Tom McDonald I appreciate it because I lost my aunt with cancer and I lost family with cancer I appreciate it bro top dog hope you hit first trending God bless you keep it up bro
This one touched way too close to home. My dad died service connected to  Agent orange... Mom has been fighting stahe 4 colon caner for the past 5 years
Make a song with NF please
There are already cures to cancer. It's time to put big pharma in its place and heal people.
My grandma died last month after fighting cancer for over a year, watching her soul leave her body has scared me um only 13 thanks tom i found a way to cope and its this song i love you man
Damn this song hits me different thanks for making this for real, my grandma passed from cancer so it's good to know that all Tom's fans care about what is happening about people with it WE ARE ALL LEGENDS
Thyroid cancer survivor here. Cancer is hell but you can beat it 👊 👊🤗🤗🤗.
to anyone who got the 2 CD package is this song on one of the cds? I'm waiting for mine so haven't got to play them yet
Damn it Tom, always smashing the entertainment sector, true words in your awesome song brother
Thank you for making this song.. It really brought out my emotions that I’ve had bottled during this time. My wife goes into surgery tomorrow to remove the cancer so say a prayer for Tiffany please
Ok Tom. You find the cure. LMAOOOO
How corny can you be at least get your facts straight if you choose sensitive topics like this you are better in making diss tracks
Any one who hit the thumbs down button your a negative bitch this is one of the best songs dropped in 2020 your so confused as to what really matters payen attention to news and media  you’ve seemed to lose touch with the big pictures which Tom paints beautifully for you bro Tom mac
I lost my dad to cancer when I was seven   A day doesn’t go by when don’t think about him.
Damn Tom why you got to be so right
The Infested wrote a song about this called "Waiting Game" If you like Punk music you should check this one out, man. Tom hits the idea of the feelings and the truth of it hard, but The Infested show you what it's like first hand.   Here are some lyrics from the song.  And just like that, I'm laying on my back, My dignity remains in pieces. I can't stand or walk, I'm pissin' in bottles, I hope for this that death's been cheated. And just like that, I'm laying in a bed, Three drips of chemo running through my veins. Nine weeks of hell, vomit, hair loss as well, I've lost count of all the pills they gave me.  And just like that, my stitches are oozing crap, I can't face to walk in case my sides split. My face, swelled up, I don't look the same no more, My skin is dry and I can't taste shit. Headaches all night, the end don't seem in sight, My veins are scabbed from all the needles. My lungs feel tight, rapid breathing this can't be right, It's only day two of this battle.
My little girl was taken by cancer she fought it for. 4 1/2 years she was 9 years old. I miss you baby.
I would give this dude money before I would ever give a hollywood sell out money. Lost my mom to am extremely rare cancer this year. She ended up a mayo cancer research hospital where if she would of beaten it, the treatment would of become the treatment for that cancer. Sadly it was too aggressive and the best research doctors in the world couldn't beat it.
My great grandmaw passed 2 years ago from pancreatic cancer. This song hits hard
I lost my cousin to cancer and i know a few people fighting cancer. Love your music
You never stop amazing me Tom.
Miss you Mom!❤️
Heart felt
damn this song hits hard...lost so many family to cancer and someone close fighting it again now..damn what a powerful song
Hey Tom, As a stage 4 melanoma survivor thanks for telling people what they need to hear. Your words are true and inspiring. For those who listened to his words, follow those words. If you feel your not ready to leave this world yet then fight till your black and blue, fight it till its gone. @Tom MacDonald why not start your own organisation for people with cancer that you feel you have control of and make sure the money goes into the right hands?
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL I SAW THIS AS AN AD
Incredible video tom MacDonald <3
I lost my grandfather and one of my best friends to cancer 😢 this shit hit hard
😭 thank you for this song
Just lost a close friend to cancer.. he was 26.. thanks for this
My trash can think this shit go hard
Just hit a million,congrats Tom and Nova,  thanks
My mother passed of cancer when I was 13, it's population control and I get it. We have over 14 births for every 8 deaths in the U.S. We might not like it, but we can't all live forever. We could go through route of China and only allow 1 child per family but then the feninazis would burn this bitch down. What's the solution?
this ol soundcloud macklamore knock off ass boy
when you made i wish, i was like man that fucked me up in a good way an sad way, everyone i show that to they tear up but man please keep it up this reminds me of that song.keep maken us feel Tom

Damn
Jesus Christ man! 😢😢😢🖤 your music 💀🎤😈
This song was needed
Bro  I needed  this...... dad's cancer  spread to his spine and wife was also diagnosed  this week. Words can't express the gravitas this had dropping this week. Thank you
Makes my eyes water man. Thank you for making such powerful music🙏 #hangovergang
Thank you! So many families have passed away and fought cancer! When I was 23 I almost had Cancer. My cells was percancerous. My brother has skin cancer now.
Family Friend just passed away because of skin cancer. He was 44 and had a 10 year old and a 7 years old. Sadly stuff like that happens and as of now there isn’t a way to stop it. But we can work together and pray for each other that we stay safe and all win this fight. 💪❤️
Bro.... Absolutely amazing. Best. Song. Ever.
I lost my grandmother to cancer a couple years ago listening to this song made me tear up and brought back the memories of her and how strong she was overall along with while she was fighting cancer I really loved this song I appreciate you for making this song thank you so much tom I love your music and I love this song I can't express my gratitude for this song through a comment but thank you from the bottom of my heart
I want my brother back 😔😔😢✌️
You are cancerous
Thank you......so many need this...
u got this luci :) <3
Using cancer to sell me your distorted world view. Wow. And I bet a bunch of you are going to say that if I dislike this video then I hate people with cancer.  Talk about virtue signaling.
Tobacco causes cancer
this deserves way more love everyone needs to hear this it hits home to a lot of people
Damn Bro!
Once again an amazing song with inspiring words!!
Lost my grandma to lung cancer. Never smoked a day in her life. My dad a bout with skin cancer. Cancer has touched more people I know then coronavirus
I like you as a rapper but good grief man.. the term clout chaser comes to mind 24 7 with you. I understand speaking on some topics but its as of every single song you make HAS to be controversial and force those views you will get bcz of it and already having a dedicated fanbase. I mean damn. Every single song. Whether about being white or if you were black, this or that its always something. Now its just cancer. It just seems crazy to me that 9x out of 10 the topic has to be controversial that you know will garner views easily. Idk its kind of annoying at times. Music is still pretty good but god.. like all the time. Anyone else have a brain and notice this? Idc for arguing, we all know its true. But wonderin who else has noticed
Bone cancer took my dad and he was only 65, I am now 55, sometimes it scares me. God bless you Tom.
Awwwww fuck tom, you made me cry
I wanna thank you for this song personally Tom and nova, I watched my mom go to the hospital to get part of her right lung removed because she had lung cancer and then have to go through radiation treatment when she got breast cancer, I thank god every day that she is doing good now and thank you because you are shedding a light on what people are going through
My mom died from cancer
My mother is fighting cancer for the second time and the doctors say it’s more aggressive than the first one. So this song hit a very deep nerve but in a positive way👊🏻 thank you💯 I’m forever a fan👊🏻
I just had this conversation with my wife and wrote this.. too real
I ain’t crying...you are!
I remember when I first knew something was wrong with my dad. Four years ago he was looking at my car and started throwing up in the driveway. My mom said he had been doing that for a couple weeks. I asked him to go in and we found out he had stage four multiple myeloma. They said hed have about 6 months to a year....he got treatment and it did nothing....guess what? Hes still here and fighting!
Inspiration
I have 2 adult friends im 15 years old ive known then since July 4th they have become 2nd parents to me well Bailey has Breast Cancer and its spreading. The chemo pills arent even helping so she most likely doesn't have long and it hurts me they dont have money for treatment and that i can't even help. This song truly brought me to tears and im going to send this to her that way she has a song to give her more hope. Thank you...
This song really had me in my feelings! I listened and cried thinking of family that has passed because of cancer, most recently my cousin Abraham, who was only 4yrs older than me!
Thanks bro
Great job Tom and Nova‼️
Love this cancer runs in my family your great keep it up
I lost one of my best friends last year from bladder cancer -  at the end he stilled smiled and tried to make everyone smile
Dads two year fight mum eight weeks fight cancer is so unfair
Damn, this deep.
Love your music brother  You as an artist rap about things that people are afraid to even talk about .Much respect for you and your girl killing it💯💥👍👍
🔥Truth I have liver disease 👍
I was jus diagnosed with kidney cancer. I had surgery Friday. They took my kidney out. I'm in extreme pain. I pray I make it thru this.
Wow that hit hard thank you tom
This song came out a few days after my grandparents announced they beat cancer. My grandma finished radiation for breast cancer and my grandpa went into remission for stage 4 prostate cancer.
my grandpa died from lung cancer in February 2020 and we spent a lot of money just so they could put him in hospice not trying to keep him alive with all that we invested. I never thought I was so close to him until I saw him on his death bed. love you man, and great song
Just when I think you couldnt get any better.....
Made me tear up
Thank you for this brother.. I lost my uncle 3 months ago , he been battling it for over 5 years , on top of that my dad an my mom have battled it. Its struggle and a fear of my own..
Tom,  A few years ago I was 22 when I was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Went through a year of chemo and radiation and luckily am in remission now. I can tell you with certainty that your music and this song is going to bring so much strength and fight to people going through the battle. You truly have a gift and we’re all thankful for it.
Thank you man my dad is fighting cancer now an its a struggle seeing him go though this
Let's clean up the cancer in Washington DC vote Blue!
Seriously
Cancer runs deep in my family Both grandmas and mom a uncle and a aunt a bunch of people I never met as well all relatives
I just got my lab report 2wks ago..., Positive for colon "C". I was SO not expecting THAT, but even tho I want to deny & ignore the results, I can't ignore the overwhelming FEAR I feel, everytime I try to pick up the phone,&schedule my next appt!😰
Every song you put out has such deep meaning. Thank you for doing what you do 🖤
Damn bro that that track was powerful ballin my eyes out still thinking bout my mom
Tom is a good man !!!! Keep it up brotha !!!
1994 was the first time i lost someone to the big C my Dad from then on it claimed a lot of my family Uncles Aunts My Mother Thank You Tom
This is to go beyond viral I'm watching my grandmother with stage 4 cancer suffering I had an uncle commit suicide cause the doctor keep saying he was fine and when they did the autopsy they find four different cancer something need to be done
I lost my dad two years ago from cancer. I never realized how horrible cancer was till I saw him suffer from it. It's the worst killer on this planet. Anyone watching someone fighting it. Hugs, know you're not alone. So much love sent your way.
love
Tears down my eyes
💪✌👊🔥💪❤❤❤❤
Not much provokes an emotional response from me these days but this hit deep in the feels. I daren't read the comments... 😥
You are such a breath of fresh air in a smog filled industry😍
This amazing thing you did tom
POWERFUL, very very POWERFUL
My dad, lung that metastasized to his brain. Gone in 6 months.
I had a friend of mine die from cancer when I was still a kid, she used to babysit me and keep me company while my mom worked hard. Another friend of mine was diagnosed with breast cancer, did the treatments and lost all her hair. She ended up surviving, got the weight back on her and her hair grew back. She's been cancer free for probably 2-3 years now
I lost my grandfather to cancer after he beat it the first time in 2001 he then got it again in 2014 and in 3 months the strongest man I know passed away. Thank you Tom
Excellent song and so well put. ❤️❤️
My dad died from cancer when I was 4 now I’m 15
Your right Tom,they have a cure,they created a multi-billion dollar industry on staying sick,they will never give it up.
AMEN
I love how Tom speaks about real shit 🤜🤛
Wow....that hit deep. Amazing job Tom, Nova and all involved.
This is why I don't understand why people balk at universal health care! Shit I understand, no one wants to pay higher taxes, but we're already paying for lower income families...     I would rather pay extra in taxes to help save people, to help regular people, everyone!  I mean a quick search for Florida taxes, (this was last year).. We're already paying for  medical care and mental health services for people who can't afford it. Why can't we do that for everybody? Middle class, lower upper class, like everybody should be able to get treatment it's not fair to people who work hard for a living and make too much money to get Medicaid!  "Indeed, one of facts few Floridians know is that most of their tax money goes to three categories. Nearly 90% of the state’s tax dollars, 88.4%, are spent on social services (48.1%), education (29.5%) and transportation (10.8%). Social services include the Agency for Health Care Administration, Children and Family Services, Elder Affairs, the Health Department and the Agency for Persons with Disabilities — all of those agencies that pay for and provide medical, mental health and substance abuse care and living services to Floridians at the low end of the economic spectrum. Within that group, the Agency for Health Care Administration consumes the largest amount — 33.1% of the state budget, or $30.3 billion.        Of that, 96%, or $29.1 billion, goes toward Medicaid, the federal and state program that covers medical costs for low-income Floridians. Lawmakers often call Medicaid the Pac-Man that eats Florida’s budget. It grows every year."   So why not pay a little more, so EVERYONE is covered? We're like almost the last country who doesn't have Universal Healthcare!  I'm not political, and definitely not great with finances or math in general, but it seems pretty messed up that we're already paying so much for the lower income, why not for EVERYONE ? Make it make sense! ---article https://www.yourobserver.com/article/where-dollar91-billion-of-florida-tax-money-goes?amp
I lost my my mom to cancer
My childrens mother. Is going threw hell right now. Ty. For this song. Tom. You rock bro

FIRE
One of your best tom
I just finished my last round of radiation after 3yrs 8hrs before it took my dad we both at cancer at the same time ....cancer is hell ....love you Tom Macdonald
Love this video and song
Today its my birthday and i wish you all have a great day...tomorrow its not promise but today its a gift, live a live they will remember, God bless you all
I took my mom everyday to her treatments, sleepless nights and the  sickness all from the Poison that helps her fight. Thankfully she is in remission.  It's truly a beautiful song thank you
Ya won me back with this one. 👌🏼
You called it Tom, yes it made me cry. We definitely all know someone thats either going through or been through a battle with cancer. I absolutely hate the cost, emotionally and financially crushing to the floor. And now they tell us everything causes it. Almost as though there's no way around it. I absolutely also believe there is much more that came out of all that money and research. Maybe not an overall cure. Just something better but, it's not profitable enough so they don't implement life saving treatment. The level of greed at the top is nauseating.  Anyway Thanks from the bottom of my heart for doing something like this. I'm so glad you have the integrity to use your platform for something so uplifting and inspiring. Good damn job bro. I hope anyone having a hard time with cancer can gain some strength from this inspiring work of art. Hope everyone is healthy and if not get better soon!!!!
As a survivor this hit hard ! Thank you !!
How many studio writers made this?
I felt this to my core, my mom fought breast cancer for two years and won the good fight. Thanks for this Tom!
*Candyman* https://youtu.be/OF_-7-XfS1Y 🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
Tom, Great song bro. Thank You!  To the "dislikers" there is a special place for you.
Damn I felt this my friends had thyroid cancer and surpassed it. Just found out last week my cousin is only 29 and has lung cancer man shits real.
in 2016 my grandpa was diagnosed with stage 2 lung cancer...it was hell not just for my grandpa...but for me...cause my grandpa is my bestfriend...and it fucking ikilled me when he said he was gonna make it to Christmas...it made me so angry...and at that point that i thought that maybe he isn’t gonna make it...but i never gave up hope...i never gave up faith...and now here we are...5 years later...my grandpa has beaten cancer...and he’s been able to spend many more Christmas’s with me and my family...and i can’t be more thankful...
Should be higher on the trending!!! This hits home and the lyrics are awesome.. I went through this with my mom in 2012! RIP mom
WTF this is bullshit haha first and last time listening. I started to tear up reading the title I cry enough don't need this to make me ball my eyes out. Good song though, cancer is fucked ):
Its the same reason they won't cure diabetes, its more profitable to treat it than cure it. Researchers aren't interested in cures only more profit.
One of my good friend has passed away from cancer 🥺😢😭😥 I will remember you want your not here with all of your friends well miss you RIP to my friend. Well you see you again soon friend. Well love you friend RIP 😥
Yes! In a matter of 7 years, 5 family members have had cancer including my father, godfather, my aunt and uncle and my mother - in - law. I lost my uncle 4th of July this year and they just gave my aunt a 30% chance. This is news no one ever wants to hear. Tom, you nailed it. Wish people reacted to cancer like they did COVID. 😞 F CANCER!
This should have 10 Billion views.
TOM
It's sad but I didnt cry.
👏🏾
Wow man.  I love this piece of art.
Thank god my mother caught her cancer early. Her father and my dads father didn’t have that privilege. They both passed away. I’m glad that my mother got it cut out of her before it turned malicious. She had the early early signs of breast cancer. She spent months wearing tubes and drains. Thank you for using your popularity and your voice to bring even more awareness to this issue. It hits home for a lot of people. With love :) (keep making topical music. It’s important in today’s age)
I can't even say without crying...my wife doesn't like rap, I'm a subscriber..she told me about this song in tears. Her adult younger brother that was developmentally disabled was taken in the matter of a week by leukemia. From first diagnosis to his last breath my wife was by his side. she was his care provider as an adult and had always been the one to hold his hand thru life.  You reached out and touched her thru this song, thank you 🙏
Crying. Brb. Okay I'm back. Ive lost so many Ive loved , to cancer. This song hits me so hard in my heart it's hard to breathe. I myself had a cancer scare , but thankfully it was just a  benign tumor in my lymph nodes. I have had to hear my mom tell me a family member had cancer. I remember the utter fear and hopelessness that took control in my mind. I remember the sleepless nights at the hospital worrying  that at any moment could be his last.  Cancer is a horrific and deviating disease for both the victim and family.
Great song! ♥️
What’s sad is being an unbeliever cuz like u said u don’t know where u go when u die. Believers know where we’re going so death isn’t something to fear! It is welcomed!
This song is so true we have been giving money to the cca for decades and we only still hive radiation treatments that's what's fucked
Gave me chills
This is great
the love and stories in these comments are unreal ❤️
My mom fought for a long time. No one could pin point what was going on - by the time they did, it was too late. She finally hit a point where she didn’t want to go through anymore. One of the hardest things I’ve EVER done is shave her head. One day she had hair, the next day she texted me and asked if I’d come over and shave what was left. It was like THAT moment made everything real, even after hundreds of doctor appointments. She died 9/30/2016. It’s the worst pain anyone can go through. I miss her everyday. This time of the year is so, SO hard. She loved the holidays. They aren’t the same without her.
We get cancer from the secrets we keeping.. .wow
East Coast reaching out, yes just last year in August cancer touch my life. I took in someone that was homeless, this one didn't have a drug problem, Health was not so good, and then and November of last year he was diagnosed which stage 4 ovarian cancer given 4 months to live. I was fortunate enough to help her get strong in her faith, in December  right around Christmas  transferred from hospital to hospice then in May her battle was over, covid did not allow me Her Last Wish to hold her hand as she crossed over, ( sad but true) Metallica Thanks Tom much love sent your way😗💨💞 stay💪 on🔥🎶🎤🔊
I had stage 4 colon cancer that went into remission back in August. Unfortunately remission was short lived as i now have to restart chemotherapy again. Thank you Tom for bringing more awareness to light. I probably wont survive this next round of treatment, but it makes me have hope for the future of other patients having an advocate like you keeping us relevant.
........JEFFERY STAR! THAAATS WHO HE LOOKS LIKE 😆
My grandfather died of bone cancer 2 years ago and it really broke me. I’d always visited his grave and talk to him and tell him how the family is doing.   I sometimes feel depressed sometimes cry and hold his tomb and ask why if we have such an industry we donate millions of dollars too, we still don’t have the cure.   I made a promise at his gravesite that I will be the grandson he’ll be proud to watch over from the skies   ~R.I.P Nelson “Mitch” Dixon  You may be gone but your legacy will live on forever
I have to WARN you all with LOVE...💝💝... We are living out revelations in the Bible, please choose Jesus Christ today while he can still be found. He died for all our sins. We all have ain in our life the Bible tells us and we each need a Savior. I'm so thankful Jesus died for my sins and please accept this gift on the cross he did for you too. He rose from the grave 3 days later and is seated on the right hand of God. We have to confess with our mouth to God we are sinners in need of a Savior. Turn from your sins, invite the Holy Spirit into your life and pray to God often, get a bible.. KJV is a good place to start!! I am praying for the ENTIRE 🌎 daily to choose Jesus today because I KNOW things in the world will continue to get worse according to what the Bible says. God is trying to shake people out if their slumber and choose him...this is his mercy on each of us!! He LOVES us so much he sent his only son to die on the cross for us so we can all make it back to heaven! Jesus took on the sins of the 🌎. I LOVE you ALL so much and pray for each person on Earth daily. He'll is real and you don't want to go there. I cry for those who reject Jesus, because I know things won't get better for them... 🙏💐💝
Voice reminds me of Violent J especially when you sing the chorus.
THANK YOU TOM FOR THIS SONG!!!!!! I personally have numerous family members who have fought cancer. Some God rest their souls have lost....... BUT more have won and are winning the fight. Most important among them my 7 year old daughter!!!!!!! #FUCKCANCER WE WILL FIGHT AND WE WILL WIN!!!!!!
17 years remission this month
Tom... that chorus though! man thats both uplifting and anger driven! It makes me want to fist bump all the survivors and throat punch the cabal that holds back the more effective treatments that we are not allowed to see.  love ya bro
Dammit bro. Straight to the heart. Must have been hard making this video cause it was hard to watch. Love the message though. We gotta live every day like it’s our last. RIP Jim, and Jakester we miss and love y’all , and keep fighting Vickie and RUSH.
My grandfather is fighting cancer right now and I have to help him with everything such as going to bed at night getting in and out of the house and out of bed Thank god for this song and for helping my grandfather make it home safely from the hospital a couple weeks ago he is still fighting and doing really well Sincerely,  Alexander R. P.S. this song is the only song ever to make me cry...😭
The reason why people are dying from cigarettes it has 7,000 different chemicals they spray it with radiation pesticide if you're sick somewhere in your body the chemicals will attack that area and you will die
My grandpa died 2 years ago to stage 4 lung and bone now my papa has stage 4 lung and a face tumor my heart akes for all of you nothing makes it better
I had 47 weeks of chemo therapy these kids and anyone who is fighting “I love you”
💓😭 we love you!!!!!
I got diagnosed with leukemia 3 months ago
Well when basically every person with cancer needs a specialized cure we will never find one cure for everyone. That's why it hasn't happened. It won't.
Does anyone still not know that Tom supports anti-abortion?
Both of my grandpas died because of cancer different types and my grandmother had lymphoma she survived but five years later she got breast cancer and we are praying she will survive this cancer too. Thank you so much for this song Tom 😌
Wow!
Thank you
My daughter was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma, a rare childhood cancer, when she was just 3 years old.  She fought as hard as she possibly could for 20 months. She received her Angel Wings just ten short days before her 5th birthday in June 2003.  There is nothing more frustrating when you are doing everything in your power to save your child's life and you know there is a most likely a non-toxic, simple treatment out there that "they" won't give us access to!! Tom you are so right about that & I'm so glad you brought attention to it & the many children & adults that are fighting so hard right now!! God Bless each & every one of them & You Tom!! You have a very special heart!! xo
Just cried my ass off. My wife just kicked the shit out of breast cancer. She had her final chemo treatment back in September and hopefully her final surgery next month. It was absolutely the most terrifying thing I have ever been through. I can't even begin to imagine how scared she really was underneath the smiles. I can't express how thankful I am to God for getting her through and allowing our kids to keep their mom. Thank you for this song.
Thank you!!! "Tom & Nova" The wife and I lost our last baby do to her having cervical cancer. Cancer runs high on her side of the family. I shared to those loved one's on Facebook. A lil fyi: The wife and I are high school sweetheart 1997. Was told we could not have kid's. Witch we had name's picked out from 9 grade lol 11 year's later in Utah. We conceived our miracle baby our 1st born. " Novalee Sunshine" 2 year's later  came "Olivia Luna and then 18 months later came "Reed  Orion. Now nearly 3 year's ago we lost " Gage Rain "  We are blessed to have Our Sun,Moon & Stars with us. And as it Rains we know lil man is up there looking down on Us. Keep inspiring people Tom&Nova💕 Powers Family Loves you both....
My cousin have died from cancer
Sorry im a little late, ive been meaning to watch this... damn...
I hope you get it
You the best Tom HOG 4life
Way to go bro. Awesome song...very needed today
Thank you
Goosebumps
Tom is on fire.
Yes, i teared up....thank you for saying the truth. Keep up the amazing music, always in the H.O.G. Love ya Tom.
Thanks Tom my Aunt died and it was hard on my family she was the youngest of 5 and the heart and soul of them all. Respect for speaking truth
My mom's mom and dad both died of cancer, I never got to meet them but my mom always tells me great things about them.
My dad was just diagnosed. My best friend. This song is amazing. Really pulls the strings man. Awesome way to use your platform. Just earned another fan
From a muslim perspective to all of you I can suggest one thing that doctors of every religion and nationality have confirmed to be helpfull. It is Rukya from the holy Kur'An... The chosen suras put together in one recitation, it is prooven by scientists it normalises every hormon and blood values in every human being listening to it live or even through headphones..... I wish you all luck, and Tom bro God bless you... (For example: Mishary Rashid - Al Rukya)
Bless for the truth. Only ourselves can fight cancers and other health problems. We must truly believe we can do it. Our body has supernatural power that if we believe with every single cells in our body, it can do miracles.
For my uncle which has cancer for the fourth time right now. He is a fighter.
Congrats on ur new video.
Tom McDonald is the only singer that makes me not think I am crazy from knowing the truth.
Thank you tom
13.1 you're almost there
This song brings rears to my eyes I lost both my parents to cancer three yrs ago
My  dad    loves you
Here comes Tom ACTUALLY making a good song. Ive said this a million times.... If he can get off the whole troll rap thing he does, he has the potential to be an amazing artist. I just think he's wasting his talent on making his idiotic tracks like "Straight White Male", and "I'm Corny"
You truly are a remarkable artist keep up the great work this song will touch billions
Thank you for fighting for us, Tom.
My dad just got diagnosed with stage 2 Colan Cancer..
Video didn't make me cry. These comments did.
....
Man. Tom.. you’re a hero to many. I am 25 years old and I’ve already had cancer twice. Took a foot of my colon and my left eye but I still have my life! 👏👏
Hey Tom I am a big fan I love all your music and the messages you convey thru your music... I just watched your video cancer and man you hit me right in my heart. I lost a great friend that had cancer beat but the treatment weakened his heart and he went from a heart attack. I only wish he could have heard this because he was a fighter and he fought with everything he had . thank you for being you and not conforming to what the masses want you to be .... you have been an inspiration to me and I hope you keep going strong like you do.
A good friend sent me this. I am a leukemia survivor. Live every day like it’s your last because you truly never know.
I wish I could give more than one thumb I wish I could give 1 million thumbs for this
Reminds me of my mom, i was adopted so i never got to meet her in person, but talked to her for 2 years were talking about meeting for the 1st time since i was adopted and then 4 days after my birthday she went in for her last round of chemo came out good but had a stroke that night, and they didnt even know she was gone until the next morning. This was in june of 2014
So true thank god someone with a voice said it billions of dollars goes in the research for cancer patients people donate every year money there are cancer drives cancer walks but yet you’re telling me that the best way to cure somebody steal today is radiation and Hard carcinogenic drugs it’s just stupid man it’s bullshit playing out bullshit it’s a money industry and they want to make money off you dying plain and simple
Bro...my grandma died from cancer a few months ago, this touches home man. I literally cried listening to this...thanks man
I just don't understand how anybody could dislike this song. Its baffling to me
Thank you Tom!!!!!! My mom past from cancer 12 years ago this means so much to me!!! Thank you so much
i love your music man u are a great artist man keep up the good work and cancer sucks but this song does not suck thank u so much for what u do
Yet another amazing song Tom! Thank you
Wow I have listened to this song over a hundred times myself and probably another 50
Wow I have listened to this song over a hundred times myself and probably another 50
i cant say there is a cure per say, i cant cure my genetics that would have 100% turn cancer in my colon instead i swim in medical debt to save my life.  we need to find safer and less expensive methods of treatment for most things. i think you have a great point that they dont fix things when they look at all of us as cash cows and they are getting rich while we suffer.
I’m few years in remission wasn’t supposed to make it but I’m still here , but what I deal with daily cause of the chemotherapy is hell and I have to hide it so everyone thinks I’m ok , #fuckcancer
Tom... I am sharing this with Relay for Life of Second Life.  This is a rally call and a fight song.   THANK YOU.
The best anti smoking an drinking song that will touch hearts
In 3 days my mom will be gone 2 years from lung cancer, she fought hard and went peacefully....last thing she left me with was holding my hand....still hard 2 years later....it changes you who you are....great video brother, it was awesome and speaks absolute truth! And those who are fighting this ugly disease keep fighting....prayers and love sent your way!
Brought me to tears. Lost my father in law this year after a long battle to survive cancer. My daughter is 18 months an barely got to know him yet says papa an gets excited everytime she sees his picture. He was a strong man an did treatment to try to stay alive for his family. Watched him suffer for almost 3 years doing treatments while keeping his head high and proud. All while companys got rich an doctors gave him false hope. This song means alot!
In juni 2018 we discover That my dad had asbestos cancer. Not in lungs but in his belly, most of the People with this kind of cancer have 9 until 12 months. My dad is still Alive. Every Day is a extra day, That i have my dad ❤️. But the future is still not sure for my dad. For now... i enjoy every extra Day, That i have with my dad
thank you tom i lost my grandma and many more to cancer. its very hard its never heals the wound.... this song man you hit a snare
I also took my step sister to all her chemo treatments. I felt like it was the only thing I could do to be supportive. I knew what she was going thru. As we went through it with her mom when we were you.... ♥️♥️♥️
Absolutely Amazing video! You always have a finger on the pulse of the People Tom. May God continue to bless you & keep the POSITIVE MESSAGE coming to all of us who need it daily.   Much Love & my utmost Respect to you Brotha. The very best to you from Upstate NY. ❤️🇮🇹❤️🙏🇺🇸🙏❤️🇮🇹❤️
My step mom Dawn had colon cancer and passed when I was 14 I only new her for a short 2 1/2 yrs. It was mostly the best yrs. When I was with her. She was the only one who care and told me I was worth something when everyone told me I wasn't. She helped me more then anyone really knows. Thank you ♥️♥️♥️

My grandma juss passed from bone cancer today. We need to hurry the fukk up
This should be the anthem for all people dealing with cancer or those who are helping someone dealing with it.  Absolutely great song.
Quarantine really took a toll on Macklemore
This song I totally understand I took care of my mom as she died from cancer not easy task but she is in a better place
The Spongebob Apparition https://youtu.be/TAVDZzb4RpQ
You are doing a very good thing.. your rap songs are meaningful and spread awareness.. it’s different then others rappers.. and I really appreciate it.
Thank you so much for this song, for this video... There's so much meaning to it. Making us realize to be grateful for what we have, love your work. God bless everyone :)
My mother's 30 years fight  just came to a rough end . She is missed
This song really hits home. I’m in my early twenties.. and cancer took my dad when I was only 21. I would give anything to have him back. Thank you for writing this. There is solace in knowing we’re not all dealing with this alone. ❤️
Those 2.5K people who disliked your song because of the music and Beat not your message
Tom MacDonald his lyrics are Universal most definitely he can reach all types of groups with his style of rhymes
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Bro if this song is no blasting at every single cancer facility they are out there mind, finally some one made a heartfelt song for the people who are suffering, its not only the person with the cancer that suffers its everyone who loves and cares for that person, fuck cancer i lost my gmal to stage 4 lung cancer father just found out he has liver cancer and a aunt with breast cancer all while a pandemic is roaring through the world man fuck 2020 and cancer
Went through it at 17yrs of age in 1985. 8 months of 2x's strength chemo, and multiple surgeries ,which I flat lined on to separate surgeries and which I had to be put into a drug induced coma for the treatments due to how volatile it was to my body . they said i had a 95% chance of not making it, but I always hated people telling me  what I could or couldn't do so in my heart and soul, I became an ass-hole and fought . its now 2020 and im 53. Dr.s dont know everything. and p.s. i had a dr friend tell me that this shit could be cured, but as she said, theres no profit in cures, only treatments.
I hope nothing bad happens to this dude he is so woke and speak pure facts in his music.
My 15 year old battles at this very moment and chemo is the worst! I shaved my head with her and said let’s do this, she is strong and amazing and nothings gonna stop her! 💪❤️
I can relate to this song so well. I am a Bone Cancer Survivor. Honestly I could say something about the industry but I don't want to leave a negative comment. Tom you are amazing
Love your music. Love that you have a message. This song dosen't represent your ability as an artist. The words are ok the music is ok the format is ok but your capable of much much more than ok.... I don't want your sound to drift into a cookie cutter as we need someone with a message. For me your songs are starting to sound similar and without the passion behind the lyrics and music it sounds to me like you tried to make this rather than being a antenna and letting the messages come through you. Keep up the good work though... hell not many can even put an ok so together. But you have set the bar very high for yourself by showing the world what talent is what your capable of and what music can be.  Don't sell yourself short and don't push a song out that doesn't feel natural. Bravo another good song to add to the many greats you have already produced. Please for the sake of humanity don't just make a song because you feel you have to. Only write the ones your passionate about and the ones that come to you naturally. This feels forced. I'm a songwriter but I haven't recorded anything due to addiction. You have " it" a rare gift to channel and hear the music before it exists in our airwaves. As someone who has this ability I'm inspired to continue writing and work on getting it to the people because of your work. You know how it goes. Don't let writers block and lack of connection to message force you to put something out that is ok. To me it sounds like most of your music comes without "effort". This song sounds like you sat down with the intention of writing it. Since you know the format it is a good song many will relate to. I just think you could have done a better job of relaying the message if you had not tried so hard. Just an opinion don't let it get to you... if you even get to read this that is.
The 2.5k who dislike are clowns
If u see this plz like and have a wonderful day , don’t be scared to die make it right with god right now there is something after this so don’t be scared just live life. My grandma had 4 different kinds of cancer and she’s still here plz if u get something like that just keep fighting
Thank you Tom for a beautiful song!
Jesus you are seriously telling your big fan base that there is no cure for cancer Bc there is money in it? God damn this is dumb. Yeah I guess there is no money in a vaccine they could sell to 330 million people that would stop them from getting cancer. This is just dumb
Grandma passed away from lung cancer 7 years ago. Only in her 50’s, it broke me. Cancer sucks
The lyrics heating every nerve on my body,
My grandpa went into the hospital on a monday cuz they thought he had a infection in his lympnote an ran test an it came back as cancer an it was already spread to his lungs an he past away that thursday 4 days later!!!! So glad he dodnt suffer long but its been 4 years past now and im still in shock at a loss for words!!!! An since then Cancer has tried to take my grandma twice!!!! An my step grandma lost her life on the operating table removing a tumor from her lung!!!! And the kick in the balls is that yes the mass was cancer but God warned her about it in time an she would have been cancer free!!!! FUCK CANCER!!!!!!! Tom thank you for this song!!!! Alot of love from Canada!!!! 🇨🇦✝️🇺🇸 Rest in Power Grandma Gail and Rest in power Grandpa!!!! I cant wait to see you again in heaven!!!! ✝️🙏🏻💜
I lost my grandma at 12 years old and thought that was the end of my road. I became suicidal and was ready to go with her, but I thank God that good people came into my life when I needed it. Every achievement I've accomplished in 7 years has been bitter sweet. She'd always ask me how my day was and after she passed her chair became empty and her voice I can't remember what it sounded like. Every year is hard but i know every year her cancer came back was harder. She and everyone who have to go through that chemo are so strong. I pray for even half the strength they have. Peace.
Great job son! Your videos and music always affect me in a positive way!
I lost my grandma in February to small cell lung cancer. She refused to go to the hospital when she fainted due to a tumor wrapped around her throat. My grandpa made her go in the ambulance. Two weeks later, she chose to go onto comfort care. 3 days after that, she passed. 11:15am on the 17th of February. I decided to head home to get a couple hours of sleep and then come back, and on the way, chose to get a coffee (it helps me sleep somehow).   The barista asked what I had going on that day, and I told her we were spending time with my grandma for her last days. She told me the sun was shining for her. About 15 seconds later, I got the call.   After saying my goodbyes, I was going home like everyone else this time. It was sunny already, about 65-70, hardly any clouds. Yet it started snowing lightly. Winter was her favorite season.
I watched a strong beautiful woman fight breast cancer. By the end it spread to her brain, liver, lungs. I miss her everyday
Respect 🍻
So so touching! I lose my grandmother 14 years ago to cancer. Keep on stompin @tommacdonald
Shit man I thought ud been diagnosed. Glad it's a song.  Hope ur well.  Good diet, love n sun shines the best defence.
I love you, omg.
My sister was diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer a few years back. And it pains me and my siblings to see how she WANTS it to slowly kill her. Her life has been rough since day one. And she puts herself through painful and harmful situations. I wish she had the fight within her still. She is letting her cancer kill her. And it very much pains my heart. I wish she knew there was better things than what shes doing.
I’m coming up on 8 years remission !!!! Thank you for this song .. it’s amazing
Ok.
Thank you for this song Tom. I just lost my wife to Cancer. This song hits home on all levels. I wish no one ever has to go through what we did.
Love it! Hard but true❤ keep doing what u do❤
My nigga... killing shit.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
First reaction no words. Just 😭😭😭.
Fukkk this hits home.... just found out my cousin has stage 4 stomach cancer 🥺
Masks destroy your brain and nervous system. They are utterly detrimental to your health and well-being. Covid 19 does not exist. Your body is merely responding to the 5G frequency which it is not accustomed to. Look into symptoms of radiation sickness and they mirror one another. Do not wear masks, do not kill yourselves willingly.
My father passed from kidney cancer when I was very young and both my grandmother’s died of cervical cancer not too long ago :(                                       ...so is it cool that I think this song is shit?
This was beautiful man
Google curezone people
lovely song. cancer is a complex disease and there are many different kinds. it requires curative treatment plans because we are all different and treatment plans have been based on genetic studies thus far. radiation and chemo are primarily still used by you have to work fast. kill the cancer before it kills you and hopefully the treatments don't do you in. it's the lesser of two evils and beats complacency and holistic treatment is advised and prescribed to go hand in hand. that said, immunotherapy is being used which is a step further in a great direction. we have prolonged life but quality of life has been impacted, incidence of secondary cancer and recurrence and long term morbitities. this needs to be addressed and the only reL evil behind it is that late term or terminal illness doesn't receive proper funding by the public doesn't like seeing the horrible reality and they want to give their money to something shiny.
They’re currently letting cancer patients die in the U.K where I live, they’ve made the NHS in to the Covid Health Service. There’s misery are death happening around us. We’re living in a Totalitarian Police State Dictatorship at the moment, please if you’re reading this... Don’t vote for Biden, because this is what you will end up with too!   Please save your Republic by voting for Donald Trump, because there’s a chance he could save us too. God Speed everyone, see you on the other side ❤️
👏👏
I swear if you are reading this comment this means that you are an amazing person for even clicking on this video.This is a cause that we all must support and pray for anyone who has it.
I love you Tom I have lost so much to cancer I almost couldn’t finish it My hubby says it’s best if you don’t know once you know you die if you don’t know you won’t go.... sometimes I wonder if he is right
Don’t like very many videos but this ones deserves it. Good job Tom. Anybody who falls victim to cancer, Keep moving forward. Even when it feels like so one is there for you or you feel like your going through it alone, remember there’s always someone out there watching over you.
🤟✊
As a guy in remission for some time now I wish to thank you for this tune. I still have a demon on my shoulder. Bless you Tom
This hits deep Tom, I've lost 2 aunts to Cancer, my sister in law beat it twice and is still in remission but one of the worst days in my life was seeing my wife learn that cancer had taken her mother's life and there wasn't anything I could do or say to make it better.
I watched my mother beat cancer and watched cancer take her from  this world it was one of the  hardest things to see i love this song thank you Tom
Thanks for this Tom.
I love how all his songs send a message to everyone watching
I lost both of my grandpas to cancer. The one guided me and taught me so much and I miss him every day. Both grandmas are survivors and so is my mother with a little sister being tested for it.
My uncle got non-hodgkin's lymphoma at 30. Almost died several times, now 20+ years later he is extreme pain and has a list of issues that are a mile long. He is still here and that is what is important, he has been able to play with my two boys, and spend time with my wife and I.
He's got a point
Ok maybe Tom might look a little weird but all his songs talks about things currently going on that most artist don’t talk about because they don’t have the courage unlike him to do it
My dad died from cancer last year. I was gone for 5 years and when I got the call I immediately left back to my hometown. The last moments with my dad was him fighting the battle. Watching cancer slowly take over him was the worse thing I have ever experienced. He fought all the way to the end and I would give anything to sit down at his table and have a cup of coffee with him whome we talk about life. Cancer took away the most important person in my life away from me and gave me a life full of pain and regret
The dislikes are from the people crying so hard they hit the wrong button
Ok I'll admit it he changed up his style but the hook is still cringey lol
This is deep!
Thank the gods I'm fortunate that I am not battling cancer or similar disease but I am currently battling myself. This morning I was in the midst of a mental breakdown (I'm diagnosed bpd, cptsd, complex anxiety disorder, schizoeffective disorder) and my older brother called me telling me to listen to your song.  We have bonded over your music. He had no idea I was in the middle of fighting voices and suicidal ideation in my mind. I listened to your song and cried hard.. The chorus of your song really hit me hard. To not give into the voices.  Thank you for sharing your music with the world.
This is immensely real .
Your message is amazing ❤🔥
👐
Tom Tom damn bro . Congrats on this )
Absolutely amazing! Definitely need the tissues ready!
Hey guys did you know cancer is bad
Tom Macdonald, I keep telling myself I need to buy an album. I find it extremely incredible what you are doing. Every video you release on YouTube is amazing, really saves my feed from the garbage music industry we have now adays. I respect how you are approaching the public and not selling out to music industry's.   You are yet a reason why humanity has hope, and of course my boi Elon haha.
The cure in Texas
life is nothing but a journey. strap on and just enjoy the ride
Wow 🔥 keep speaking about the unspoken what a song 🔥🔥🔥
omg im a very longtime terminal cancer warrior...my bff just shared this on my facebook cancer group and im glad that he did......omg im still crying...nm that the video is sad...ur words just gave me the chills!!!!!!!!!!  im sharing this on my music page on facebook too!!!!!!!!!
My ex is a 6 year Medulloblastoma survivor. She didnt want to come out of her house because people judged her walking with a walker and her hair.
That  was beautiful
damn your a fuckin G for making this.
This is not what I expected. Goddamn bro.   I need a minute to formulate my thoughts before I say anything else.
Apparently a cure for AIDS is higher priority. 🤡🌍
0:52 - 1:16 ❤️
I cried like a baby. I lost so many loved ones due to cancer and only 2 family members survived. This song is amazing though!
Well your right I cried like a baby man this hit so hard thanks Tom your an amazing artist
My grandpa died in 2011 from two different types of cancer. He was a savior as some would say. My grandma and him we’re together for 25 years. She was just getting out of an abusive relationship and she to this day cannot get over how he pulled up in a convertible next to her at the grocery store, wear a big cowboy hat. She remember every word he said “hey there pretty lady, need some help?” And since that day they were inseparable. He helped my grandma, mom, uncles and aunts know what good was. I. Was 11 when he died. It didn’t hit me right away...about a year later I ran outside to garage to show him something and just broke down because I forgot he wasn’t there...he really was a wonderful man. To this day I miss him with all my being..and to tel you the truth, we all good use him more than ever right now..
Tom MacDonald is the only cancer you can't get rid of.  Pandering much?
💕Jesus Loves You 💕  💙The Holy Spirit is with you 💙  🔥The Father Loves you 🔥   Trinity God has created you.  He Loves you...  All power is in His Hands!   God so Loved you that He sent His son Jesus Christ to die for you on the cross.  If you would repent and believe in Him, He is Faithful and Just to forgive you, For ALL of your sins.  Believe in Him today! God Bless you! ✝️
This song hit the heart my grandma passed away from cancer that had spread throughout her entire body love you grandma R.I.P

Being 30 an 3 kids under 11. With an amazing husband who battles wanting to sit an be by my side on my sick days but be a ruff strong man to put it in the back of his mind to find a job and work... insurance sucks and can't afford shit..  Alot of the time I want to end my life so My kids an husband can survive an not be in debt from debt collectors an taking our home an vehicles an credit so he can't get into another home for our kids.. So much comes at you that pushes you down an stands on you like a paddle stool to brag how tall they are...  FUCK CANCER

Gah!  😢 This one made me cry instantly. My mom breast cancer metastasized and came back in her lungs over a year ago... she stays for an even though she lost her husband in July this year she still alive and kicking! I hope the treatments continue to keep the cancer at bay so she can live as long as possible! Thank you for bringing light to another hard topic for everybody to pay attention to you! Also if you actually read this and you have an already seen the documentary movie called STINK on Netflix I would love it if you would suggest it for all of your fans and I s find out for themselves to be more aware and try to create some actual changes!!!!!!!!!  💖
Tom, Nova...this song hits me on so many different levels...my grandma Palmer and my mom were both diagnosed with breast cancer within weeks of each other. I'm not sure what stage granny's was, but Mom(having just turned 32) was diagnosed with stage 3. Stage 3 with a 7 yr old, a 2 yr old, and a 10 month old(me). My Dad, who was killed in a wreck a year ago October 7th, was 26. I'm always in awe at the strength and courage they both displayed through her chemo and radiation that she went through alongside her mother. Without a doubt, they are my biggest heroes. On October 29th, 2 months shy of my 32nd birthday, to the day, I'm scheduled for my first mammogram and I am absolutely terrified. You guys dropped this song at the perfect time. Thank you both for your dedication and hard work, and most of all, thank you for the LOVE you show us. #HoG4lyfe. Love y'all
The world:  Tom macdonald: anything about anything so someone will pay attention to me
I've never had cancer but, I did have brain surgery once. This song reminds me that we only have one life, so I better damn do it my best!
Wow this song is shocking
I cried so hard. RIP  GRANDMA AND GRANDPA SCHOBER CHARLIE FORD AND THOSE I KNOW THAT ARE FIGHTING NOW!  THANK YOU TOM MCDONALD FOR THIS SONG!!
I just lost my dad to cancer. It took him quickly we found out a few days before thanksgiving of last year and he past in February of this year. We miss him so much.💔💔
My father had kidney cancer as well as Liver cancer he's still dealing with health problems ontop of his job of 25 years firing him after loyal service. This song really meant alot to me thanks Tom and Nova, thanks for everything you do.
You make great music Tom. And Nova makes art with the videos. You two are great together.
Lost my gramps to an aggressive form of lung cancer several years ago, he was 84. Now a close family friend has mouth cancer. Great song, right in the feels.
" our best defense is living like we dont know what cancer is fight it if you have it and pray that theres something after this"
My dad got lung cancer 2 years ago. They said they caught it so early that they could operate. It’s currently spread, chemo and radiation have done nothing. He’s starting to cough more often and I know the time is running out. We didn’t get along growing up much but I know our days together are numbered so I’m making the most of it. All this and I still maintain my sobriety date cause I know my dads proud of at least that.
My mom just passed away about five weeks ago from cancer. I’m 20 and I can’t believe I’m going to have to spend the rest of my life without my mom. Fuck cancer!
A good family friend just passed away from it and my mom is currently fighting
My grandma just went through chemo/radiation for lung/lymph node cancer. This is her 4th time with cancer. She's currently cancer free but watching her go through all that was heartbreaking and knowing it could come back at any time is terrifying.  Love the song. Definitely hit some feelings.
I lost my grandpa from cancer
cringe
Amazing vid and song man
I love all your music. It has been a big help for me since I discovered it almost 3 years ago. This song hear really hits home for me. When I was a kid my mom was & still is my hero. Unfortunately cancer entered our life. I was forced to watch her die from that terrible disease.
THERE IS SO MUCH RESEARCH OUT THERE IF YOU DIG HARD ENOUGH ON HOW TO NATURALLY BEAT CANCER.  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND LOOK IT UP FOR ANYONE WHO SUFFERS WITH THIS DISEASE OR SOMEBODY CLOSE TO THEM THAT THEY CARE ABOUT.  ALSO DID EVERYBODY KNOW VIRUSES AREN'T ALIVE. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THERE'S ONLY TWO REASONS WE GET SICK PARASITES AND TOXINS. THINK ABOUT IT!
I lost my step dad to cancer, he was a court officer on long island ny and got cancer from being a first responder on 911. RIP Jeff
Do not believe the advertisements about Martin McSally,  everything they say she's doing is what the Democrats have done
We all know that the corrupt government's of the world have the cure for this horrible of a  condition but big farma Makes to much money out of pain and suffering of the beautiful people of this world I only hope and pray that the people who have this knowledge will not escape justice in the this or the next life you know who you are sleep easy with your millions but the clock is also ticking away for you . God bless anyone who is going through the pain of cancer my heart goes out to you all 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
My 86 year old mother is battling metastatic breast cancer. After having it for 7 years, the Dr told me she should be placed on hospice because it will be within 6 months for her to pass. Well, she said no and now 5 years later, shes still at home and fighting. Drs dont always have the right answer.
The struggle is real!! Ty bro.
Lost my grandma 6 years ago to a gleomastoma brain tumor. Today is her birthday. Thank you for this song. She fought every day. Working everyday to make her proud. I dont know if it gets easier with time but Im hoping time will be easy and allow me to remember her laugh and her voice for as long as possible. If your out there fighting, dont give up!
I swear treatment kills faster than the cancer. My mom went from feeling fine at stage 4 to instantly sick after first treatment. Radiation caused cancer in her intestines. They removed 18 inches of her intestine. Only to have it return 2 weeks later in another area. They preformed a procedure to stop the bleeding which cut off the blood supply to her intestines which in turn killed her intestines. They gave her the option after their F up to remove her entire digestive tract and put her on a feeding tube and colostomy bag or hospice and gave her 2 weeks to live. That was. On halloween of 2019. She chose the later. My sister and I took her home and watched her die an horrific death. She passed on November 15,2019. Only 8 months later watched my brother go through the same kind of death at 50 after 1 treatment and a procedure to remove fluid from his lungs. He was diagnosed the first week of July 2020 and sadly lost hin on Sept. 5, 2020. At this point I think chemo and radiation killed them faster than the cancer. It is a hereditary gene my family has. Every family member this far we have lost on my moms side has died from lung cancer. Im sure my day is coming with the same diagnosis. Dont think I will go through those treatments. Im seriously thinking of going with a more holistic approach. I will fight to stay as healthy as i can to stay alive. Only God knows how long that will be. Thank you for taking the time to read this comment. I know ot is rather long. God bless.
Tom, this is finally the type of songs I need to here from you. Thanks you and Nova for this. I thing there is enough songs about the music industry, haters etc. Make music like this, music with deep meaning. Thanks.
Not my type of  music  But  you know good music when you hear it  .       To all the figthers. Stay strong  You have this
TOM and NOVA you guys RESTORES my hole UNIVERSE 🤙🏻👁️🌔🌕🌖🌑🌔
Cancer runs rampant throughout my family, Male and female, so this song hits home for me, truer words have never been spoken, lots of love

My Mom died of cancer a week ago today. 😢 I believe they have a cure... 😠
Can any1 else say they got goosebumps 4rm the lyrical truth he just dropped? Lets get it "Don"@ld
My aunt has beaten breast cancer twice now. A few days ago she hit the 5 year mark of cancer free. I'm on my final stretch of chemo pill cycles for a 6 cm brain tumor I had removed last year. Radiation and chemo both suck. I'm thankful everyday I'm still here and pray for everyone and their families that are dealing with cancer.
As a survivor of childhood cancer and becoming new father, this song and video hit me so hard. Its so powerful and the way Tom unfolded this message and put out there like this is just awesome. Keep on putting out good vibes Tom Macdonald.
Things are going to get way worse unless people start getting out there and protesting in mass worldwide https://youtu.be/pysQnteGT7g
This tough 🔥🔥🔥
Holistic medicine and life style, there's many cures and preventions when you look outside of "western medicine".
You can KNOW where you are going to go when you die! God came to earth as a man, Jesus Christ, to pay your full debt and make your salvation in heaven just as yours. All he requires is that you put your full trust in Jesus Christ’s righteousness to take you to heaven, and bot trust anything else, just Christ. Acts 16:30-31 says point blank, what must I do to go to heaven, and Paul and Silas answered “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou SHALT be saved.” Good or bad people has nothing to do with going to heaven or not, I can show you in the Bible that trying to be a good person to go to heaven is a sure way to go to hell.
*Hey .. to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*
I've lost two of the most amazing people on the planet last year to brain cancer.. They were responsible for all the best in me and it hurts everyday they're gone. I keep living the best I can, to keep their souls alive.  I give all my love to anyone fighting this battle.
When my brother was 3 he was diagnosed with AML luekimia. He beat it, but it came back 4 months later. He is now 7 living a happy and healthy life. Some people are not as lucky as me to have someone they love stay in their lives.   I'm thankful everyday of my life.  Thank you Tom for this beautiful song.
In 2015 my mom was diagnosed with severe breast cancer until that moment i was not a man. She is alive today because shes a fighter. Thank you tom so much
My dad was sick and no body knew what. One day he was in the hospital and we found out he had Stage 4 Colon cancer and it spread to other organs. When he had to stay in the hospital my mom stayed with him during the day and I stayed nights with him and I would hold his hand. I would take him to chemo and mom would stay with him inside when I would sit in the car eight hours because I wanted to be close to them. They only allowed one person in the chemo room. I hated seeing him so week. My dad was a fighter but he passed away at home with us around him. My son he was 17 and he  talked about his day at the memorial service, and my daughter was in third grade she even spoke. There are days when I still break down in tears. He loved shinny pennies in the end and when I see them they reminder me of him and it also makes me cry. I cry in silence cause I have to be strong for my mom and my kids.
This one hits home. Ouch
You're an outstanding human Tom. I hope you get to experience Fatherhood because you would be an amazing Dad & the world needs more caring/strong people. Love & appreciate you Bro.
Got me with this one Thomas
I lost my mother to cancer last June. The Dr.'s miss diagnosed her & by the time they caught it , the cancer was too far advanced & had spread to all her major organs. I love & miss my mother so much. 💔😢
Great message. Fight. For everything.  EMO vibe with this one...but it's still TM's art...so I fuxx with it. Put all your loved ones in a room. EVERYONE will die one day. We have a huge problem in our culture about death...we fixate on it. We deal with it in really bad ways. Our media and Hollywood glorify it. Our politicians and industry use it for personal wealth. And they all use it to gain power and subsequently control.  I say all of that to say... There won't be any Uhaul truck behind your hearse. Born alone die alone.  We put to much of ourselves into material things. The real wealth is family. friends. experience. knowledge. Legacy. Cancer is evil. That's everything...Good and evil. Regardless of faith...social status...race...wealth...you can get it. Dont let it be the boss. Make it your bitch. Dont let people feel sorry for you. Be positive by telling everyone that asks about it...Fuck Cancer. I'm gonna eviscerate this parasitic disease from my body and mind and get on with life. Be willing to do ANYTHING to get the care you need....(Denzel/John Doe style)
The timing on this is....2020. Just got the call this morning about my mom passing from it....
I lost my Uncle Glenn to cancer two years ago thanks Tom 😭😭
My grandfather died due to cancer in 2004. I was only 7 at the time. My mother told me and my brothers when he died. She told us that she had just went over to see him at his apartment the night before and told him that they would see him tomorrow. The next day my mother went over to his apartment to find him laying in his favorite chair, at peace. It hurt my mom when he passed. It still does to this day. We also lost our dog to cancer as well. There is a bright side to this. My mother's godmother bear breast cancer a few years back and she is living a good life. Stay strong for the ones who have left us and be brave the ones who are still fighting. Thank you Tom. Thank you.
This is powerful. Cancer will touch everybody’s life at some point. Stay strong 💪🏻
Well, cancer just got triggered
Really gonna help a lot of people bro. Thank you.🙏🏼🙏🏼💪🏼
Lung cancer killed my dad ! Thank you so much Tom and nova!
Wow...hits home
Lung cancer died from complications from sepsis infection. Miss you dad!
Going through metastatic breast cancer with my mom for the past 13 months. Thanks for this track Tom!
Sad people can even dislike this God bless all who are going through any disease God bless your soul and stay strong
I have watched about all these rap videos that are in TRENDING today. This is the only on worth a shit.

The military gave my dad thyroid cancer when they hid a chemical contamination for over 20 years, I miss him so much
More people need to see this. -a cancer survivor
I'm battling brain cancer
Miss you immeasurably Momma..10 months now. You were a warrior.
This is beautiful and touching! 💕 i wish someone would make a song as beautiful as this one that would help people like me with C-PTSD, depression, extreme anxiety, and Panic Attack Disorder! For people like us they make us take sooo many pills. Go to millions worth of drs, therapists, inpatient/outpatient programs. So many people like me are not as blessed as me in terms of being able to get the help they need. So many unnecessarily go to addiction, homelessness, or suicide. I wish someone could give them a voice, and i hope one day it would be Tom Macdonald!
RIP MOM, lung cancer
Thank you Tom and Nova for making such incredible music. Your words have touched so many people. I’m so thankful you guys made it. You’re changing lives
My fight has been since day 1... when a birthmark was found cancerous with a small tumor at the age of seven... so the hospital did a procedure that was still at the time in testing. They removed the whole mark. But in the end I never woke up I was overdosed with anesthesia by 30mg... meanwhile another kid from a car wreck woke up in surgery in the other O.R, our doses were switched. Fight didn’t end there. I now fight Epilepsy every day, having multiple seizures a night, all caused by the overdose. They said I’ll die a young age (high 20s or 30s) and I’ll become weak from the multiple medicine.... Damn I love proving them wrong. I am 28, healthy and have doctors baffled, got a husband with two healthy sons and look to die an old age holding the hand of my husband. I know it’s not a full cancer story,  but because of it I landed somewhere I never thought I’d be. But remember with every downfall you get up stronger, and sometimes doctors need a reality check too that people have fighting spirit, show them that! Because I swear, once you do and win your battle, they have to sit there and think how you didn’t become a statistic in their book. To anyone fighting a battle, my prayers go out to you!
Three weeks ago I lost my aunt to breast cancer. She beat it years ago but it came back and she was too weak to beat it. Rest easy Aunt Sheila ❤️
I love u Nana 😢💧💧💧 like a baby rn uncontrollablyit's not the lyrics it's just of thought what we been through in humanity couldn't even watch the whole video keep banging @tommacdonald where are watching and my heart goes out but I also want you to rap about things you haven't experienced as well as the others this platform that you have built you deserve but it is bigger than you
40% will get cancer... really are these numbers real? like is it proven to be like this?
I can relate to this song. I fight for my life everyday against non hodgkin's lymphoma. Thanks for the extra inspiration to fight. Much love and respect
This hit hard
Look for the cause not the cure.
Hits close to home
You're all going to die. That's just fact. Get used to it.

This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that breaking even just one of these commandments makes us guilty of breaking them all.   The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved.  The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ .  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i
My mom passed away in 2013 from breast cancer
Wow.So beautiful.My girlfriend has cancer and my dad recently passed away from cancer.Fuck cancer
Bit shit really. The hip hop version of Katy Perry's fire work.
I lost my Grandfather to stomach Cancer last year.. thank you for this... I haven't been able to fully let go. And accept it until now.
No Ho's, drugs, guns, cars or money. How can this be? Wait, because he has talent and raps about life and the struggles we all go through. Very talented and Mr. MacDonald you will be around a long time.  This new song, Cancer, will outlive you and most here. It will continue through the ages until there is finally a cure
Hmu if you have colon cancer.  Been fighting it all my life, I’m still here; “My deaths were controlled,” It was my conscious decision to came back, I’m here to help.
Rip aunt Sony she killed her self after the cancer came around again and she knew she wasn’t going to live so she swallowed a bottle of pills never got to meet her luv ur music btw
Fighting pancreatic cancer right now and beat leukemia 20 years ago. You did something for more of us then you will ever know and I thank you.  I am a warrior along with all my other brothers and sisters in this battle.
People in my family had it and survived but my grandma sadly didn't she passed in 2012 from lymphoma. It has been hard but I have healed from it a lot but it will take a lot longer to fully heal. But I look at it this way she hasn't been in pain for a long time and ik she's watching over me and my whole family. Rip Ily 🥺❤️
Easter 2021 will be 2 yrs since my boyfriend's dad passed away due to cancer 😢
I have always believed they could come up with a cure but corporate America just believes in the money than a cure
My little cousin was diagnosed with cancer about 10 years ago or so she fought through it and is still with us but now my Aunt/ her mom was diagnosed about 3 years ago I just wish I was there more through it all 💔 Love more,Hate less.
He just keeps composing one impressive track after another. Better than a lot of rap artists out there.
Every case oof cancer is unique to the individual like a fingerprint
We have to stay strong (mentally and physically). They are trying to get us addicted to EVERYTHING! Propaganda and Fear at the moment. I am a wolf, not a sheep.
Rip grandma i miss u
Another great song! Thanks Tom
This hit deep
Hey Tom. Thank God this is almost to 1mill cause idk how many times I can watch it. Love the messages and how much you truly care. But I can't handle music that makes me cry. Thats why I stay away from Castles. It hits home for me DEEP. But I need music that makes me feel like I can do anything!  I'm NOT hating on any of your music. You are a genius!  The best at what you do. Thank you for everything you and Nova do!
Of course Tom thinks cancer is a consipracy. Jesus Christ have some respect for the people who are spending heir lives working toward a cure. Cancer isn't your clout
I’ve listened to this song at least 1000 times now since Friday!! Some sad tears but also many good tears knowing I’m strong and I’m not ever going to quit on myself!! Doctors told me when I was 23 yrs young that I’d never see 30..I just had my 37th birthday on the 6th of October and I’m still fighting everyday and every night!! This morning after my normal Tom MacDonald therapy I decided to take a good long look in the mirror and I told myself “never stop being you, you’re strong and you can continue to beat this!! There’s nothing you can’t do and there’s many that want you to continue to make others happy..even if you’re hurting like hell..you’re strong!!” Thank you Tom and Nova, I really hope you guys continue to change the world each day, you guys are the FUCKN BEST and I love you both for it!!
tom  please keep spreading the truth  i hope one day all the messages will get through i was raised on old ways of family and togetherness I'm 22 today and this is rarely seen in my world anymore  i truly hope your music is helping people wake up please keep making wonderful music and to hell with the haters  appericiate your sound brother
No other artist can make you cry with empathy and fill you with hope and courage at the same time. You have a beautiful heart and brilliant mind Tom Macdonald
My father had/has cancer he had surgery 1 week ago, now he needs to do chemo, he was bones and skin when he came out of the hospital. But this song is awesome. ;)
Tom thanks for your music its helped me thru my darkest days. If it wasnt for you and your music i would of be dead from drugs thxs to ypu and nova im able to see my beautiful daughter and persue my dream of music forver hang over gang  love ypu guys
Literally balling my eyes out, listening to this on repeat... Tom, thank you... ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Why is he not platinum
Big fan, my dad died of cancer and so did my grandpa and great aunt. Be honestly..... this song didn't touch me in anyway. It felt almost forced.  I want to like everything but. I'd still say "I can't sleep" made me cry this nothing. Still really well done and I can tell it meant something to Tom to make it. Once again not hate i love the gang!!!
Respect. Thank you man.
The sick thing is, is that cancer is a cash cow, and the doctors and scientists don't want it to go away and neither does the pharmaceutical companies.
Man this hit hard. Dad got diagnosed with esophageal cancer almost 6 years ago. He fought it as much as he could. Eventually lead to brain and colon cancer. Lived another 2 years with that. We did as much as humanly possible as a family over those rough years to get some much needed and missed bonding time in just in case it didn't work out.  Had a few strokes in late 2019/early 2020. Seemed to fully recover. Then one day I get a text from mom that he's being transferred to a different department bc something was wrong. A few days later and he can barely respond or open his eyes. Moved to hospice. I didn't want to see him bc the last time we had talked, it was a beautiful conversation at the house before he went in for tests a few days prior. 4 days after he was admitted to hospice and showing zero improvement, I made the rough decision to go see him after work one morning. He was out of it, hooked up and unconscious. I spoke to him for about 10 minutes about different stuff just hoping he could hear me.  An hour after I went home, mom got a call that he passed.
Damn bro,that hit home 😭.keep spitting that truth always...✌️
Damn it Tom , You impress me with every song that you do you speak the truth where everybody else is scared to God bless you Brother I'm so happy you're succeeding in life and I know behind the scenes everybody has problems at 10 years old my best friend died from brain cancer. Im 48 Years Old and I love Your Music.
I was closer to my grandpa more than anyone else in my family. He came down with leukemia and it killed him within 4 months of diagnosis 5 years ago. He was only 68. He was a great man and will be forever missed
I relate my aunt died when I was 13 and I'm 16 and still ain't got over it
Thumbs up! Always spitting true shit!
But don't we all wanna Leave here
Who the hell down votes this? Big pharma.
Yup that song made me cry like a lil b*t*h 💔💕💔💕
If your are in the oil and gas industry  Biden is a threat to your family.  I cant afford to loose my job and start over. I do not like Donald Trump. Donald Trump is not a threat to my career. My family manufacturers firearms and Kamala will make them homeless as well. Vote Republican  Please! I dont want my kids to be homeless. I am to old to loose everything and go back to school to learn a new trade and rebuild.  Please,  yes Trump is an Ass  But the millions of jobs Biden will cost us all is unconscionably insane. Raising corporate taxes will force companies to leave the USA, even more jobs lost, the ones that stay cant afford to give you a raise, they cant hire more help, so you will be over worked and under paid. 4 more years of Trump then we will have a more presidential candidate. Biden and Kamala are for the violence in the streets,  it hurts the Republican campaign so they push the media to promote the violence. It's not conspiracy its smart politics. They have a Good idea for the future of America but they have a horrible plan of how to go about it. Please Vote for Trump  Save America until we can either have a more presidential Republican or more reasonable Democrat. Or an independent with a foresight to lead us all. God Bless you all. Do the research on the corporate tax hikes, the green new deal, the end of the oilfield and the end of the 2nd amendment. It is terrifying. They have good intentions, they just are not looking at all the immediate repercussions. Trump 2020 Yea it does hurt to say that. Guy has said and done some really stupid things. But he wont ruin our workforce !
According to some people Real Talk in rap is "corny" good shit bro loved this
No words for this.. Tom is the best .. keep on inspiring and making our lives better
#woke
Damn bro..
Absolutely heart pulling song & I'm a 6' 5" 290 pound tattoo covered man & I cried at the end of the song which I very rarely do........I just subbed to you so keep up the amazing work!!
Seeing cancer's diminishing someone's essence is disheartening.

Rip Uncle Mark
I remember when one of my good friends growing up had be diagnosed with cancer. We all supported him every step of the way! I remember it so well...  a bunch of us (10 or more)all shaved our heads in an effort for fundraising to help with medical bills. In the end his battle was won and is doing very well now but, the sad part is we all know they can do more and they don't!!! It's time to stop lying to the people and start helping them instead! Times are changing and we the people as a whole are changing if  the medical field,  big pharma ,  corporations, government, and other various leaders don't change with is they will be lost and long forgotten!! We all need to Rise Up! Let's change the world the time is Now!!!!
The reason there isnt a “cure” for cancer, is because cancer isnt a disease that you can treat with medications. Cancer cell proliferation is your bodies defense system. Its your alarm. Its how you know that youre killing yourself. You have complete control over how cancer cells grow. If you pollute your body with toxic chemicals, toxic food, toxic lifestyle, you will almost certainly see cancer cells spread. It rarely happens with people who take good care of themselves. Most of you who go to the gym and look good naked, actually take terrible care of yourselves, you hot skinny girls have toxic lifestyles, you poison yourselves with beauty products, cleaning agents, synthetic foods, drugs and medications. Everything the average american puts in and around their bodies is toxic and cancer cell causing. All of your families will keep dying. These songs do nothing. Your pink ribbons do nothing. You do nothing for your families. Mom and dad are smoking cigs, drinking beer, eating meat, using Tide, washing with alchohols, not doing anything healthy, and you all cry and act like its some freak accident that they died. Your families are killing themselves, and if youre too cowardly or stupid to stop them, then youre enabling their deaths. When you realize that cancer isnt a disease, and therefore preventable, treatable, reversible, you start to hold the individual and those around them accountable. Cancer cell activation is nearly always lifestyle and diet induced. Consider cancer sort of like diabetes, where it was created almost always by the user themselves. Yes some really unlucky babies are born, but millions of you will drop dead from what you ate, what you smoked and how shit your self care was. You, your parents children, need to start giving tough love. Cook for them. Physcially force them to stop smoking tobacco. Do anything other than bitch about it to the other family members, and then cry when they drop dead. You enabled them. Guess you didnt care about them enough to be the bad guy once in a while. Dont act so distraught now. Cancer didnt kill pop pop, pop pop killed pop pop. Can you handle that? Of course not. More of you will try and blame the doctor than blame your parents. Reality is just too much for so many of you. You will sit in silence and watch all your loved ones kill themselves and feel guilty speaking up, yet dilude yourselves and never feel guilty for your role in their destruction. This avoidence of fact, this betrayl of reality, ensures you repeat your grandparents and parents mistakes, and rot away as cancer eats you, and your clogged hearts burst. Its not “heart disease” unless you were born with it, its “i took shit care of my heart disease”, youre just used to the shortened version.
My grandma died cause of cancer and seeing all these poor kids (babies) getting cancer is so unfair 😢
This song hit me hard in the feels i list my gma to cancer and my mom beat breast cancer
My baby sister died of cancer like 6months ago this song hit home with me.  Iv learned alot about cancer and I believe it has more to do with our toxic thoughts and negative thinking as in the dr says were sick and we believe it and  give  up in a way when we believe the doctor.  See your self as healthy and healthy you will be even to say I'm not sick is still focusing on the sickness. Only say I'm am healthy strong I feel good.   We also have to let go of grudges anger and the demons we battle inside. Pray for continued health! My sisters name was Sarah South and I ONLY MISS HER WHEN IM BREATHING!!!!!
My dad has been a 9 year skin cancer fighter. ❤️💯
My best friend lost their fight to cancer, but not in the way you may think After months and months of the stress and the worry, anxiety and depression got the best of her. Even though she was kicking cancer, her mental was taking the hit. Cancer fucks with so much more than just the persons body. Its the persons thoughts and feelings, its their family and friends. Fuck cancer. This is a brilliant video, its a shame it reminds me of a bad time but this will and should help so many people
I had cancer , myself at the age of 19 and I survived . I love the fact that you made it realistic including what it takes to fight it and everything. ❣️
I've slightly hated on Tom's music in the past. Fuck this one really hit me. My pops passed a week ago after a 7 year battle with cancer. This song is absolute truth.
My brother in law passed 4 months ago- less than 3 months after diagnosis. He left behind a wife and 4 children. Youngest 5. So incredibly heartbreaking for the family. My children miss their uncle. Fuck cancer.
Cancer took my grandmother away from me 2 years ago ,thank u Tom❤💪🏼💯❤💪🏼💯❤💪🏼💯❤💪🏼💯❤💪🏼💯❤💪🏼💯❤❤❤❤❤
If you gave this a thumbs down you are one of two things. 1. Just a hatin ass mfer. 2. You gotta be a heartless worm of a human being.  Lost most of my family members, that have passed, to cancer. Funny how ultra rich people get it and make "miraculous" recoveries. But we, the reason they are rich, are condemned to a roll of the dice and the worst kinds of treatments and medications.  I love this joint Tom. You are my #1 by a long shot bro
How many cancers are there Tom... 🤷🏻‍♂️
I have survived the passing of my Grandfather, Grandmother, Mother,  Father and my little Brother due to cancer. They all fought to make me understand there is love and moreover that there is something beyond this life. Thank you for this it has touched my soul
Lost my sister 23 yrs young 10 yrs now this song hit me hard
Tom the rapper with a message McDonald 💯🔥
this was so powerful
This really but home,I watched my father  through 6 months of chemo. AML Cancer sucks ❤️💙
no offense but sounds like white people problems, sorry lol
The globalist are trying to kill us off while they profit, diet and movement is a big factor in if we get cancer. Important topic to touch on 👏
I'm really sitting here in tears. My mom lost the war seven years ago, and tomorrow is her birthday. She would have been 66. Awesome song, thanks Tom!
tom is a lyrical genious hes smart as hell
My rapa
My dad has stage 4 stomach cancer he was doing chemo it didn't help but make him look like death now he's doing radiation 5 days a week he went from 160 pds to 87 pds. A he does is sleep n he doesn't eat if I lose him ill lose a big peace of myself he's my best friend. Fuck cancer.  But im praying for every body who's going through what my dad is going through.
My sister fought and beat cancer twice. Unfortunately, she lost her third battle on August 3, 2015. This one really hits home Tom. Thank you.
I lost my dad to brain cancer 9 months ago. He was diagnosed 6months before that when he started having seizures and needed emergency brain surgery that day. I have been struggling to accept that he's gone and have been struggling to move on from those horrid 6 months. Songs like this help so much in ways I can't explain. Thank you so much Tom.
My oldest siblings dad passed at 44 years old. His second oldest son (my second oldest brother) experienced his death on his 24th birthday. My moms first husband, first love.  My stepdad got his liver transplant on Christmas 2019 after fighting liver cancer
Cancer took my mom on September 4th at 3:34 p.m she fought long and hard, there is a hole now and I cannot fill it! There is so much pain mentally I dont know how to deal with it! Thank you Tom for speaking for those without a voice!!!!!
I'm a survivor. The FDA has been lying to us all and extorting us for generations. Preach, brother. 💜💚💛✌️
Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the blood of Jesus? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. https://youtu.be/A159GcAffpI
my dad passed away 3 months ago guess why, cancer
I don't  care if I go to heaven or hell.
Watched this while holding my baby girl. When the mom in the video laid in the bed with her sick child it broke me. I felt my heart ache. Fuck cancer !
he raps with truths in his songs
I truly believe this song will help anyone going through this horrible sickness
I lost my Grandfather to cancer 26yrs ago this year and my Grandmother had cervical cancer aswell but recovered also. Thanks for the video and highlighting the fact that by now we should of found a cure for this ❤️  We keep running and fighting until then though.
Thx for that bro. Lost both my parents and multiple friends to this disease. The day my mother was told she was terminal. I quit my job and stayed home with her.  Just cause.  My dog was laying beside her when she passed. She didn't want to leave the room.  It's a horrible feeling. Leaving the room knowing your loved one has just left this realm.
Why you gotta mess with my emotions like this man? 🥺.. I've seen the most joyful person I know fake a smile for the sake of a family that was falling apart everyday. Peace and love to everyone who lives with the memories of those who lost their lives to cancer. To those still fighting I pray you and your family finds healing 🙏🏾
This made me 😭
Yo this shit was so fucking hard good fucking job tom macdonald this will touch everyone stay fly bro
My mamaw battled cancer for 3 years. Soo much pain, soo much love, soo many tears.  She went home to God in February 2017.
Blown away by this just whoa!! Powerful song
This song is truth 4 yrs ago lost my father to rare cancer of the blood!! R.i.P. Dad miss you 🌹
Gut Wrenching Brother 🤕
🔥
rip
Bro, my wife was diagnosed a year ago with stage 4 lung cancer. She was 23 weeks pregnant at the time. We now have a beautiful little girl. Thank you for this song. And for always speaking the truth✌️
Video was good.but song sucked baddd.... This dude doesn't care about people and their problems he's just trying to get rich off people's pain
I can't wait to see this song performed live that stage is gonna shake to the ground
❤️
It figures it takes a white rapper to finally rap of some importance big importance instead of talking about how much money and bitches you have or instead of giving life they talk about taking life if you want my opinion or even if you don't cause i don't care what anyone thinks those type of rappers are cancer.
Why is this on the trending tab
Keep dropping that tea! Wake up people! Love his videos 😍 raw, always talking about issues people don't want to see or admit occur.
Almost 1 million in 24 hours 👍
My mother is currently fighting Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer. She has been fighting for about 3 years now. I appreciate this song. I’m crying my eyeballs out! I am so proud of her and her strength! That goes to anyone else that is fighting right now as well. To the families and patients, keep fighting. God Bless.
Tom u are now one of my top 5 artists not even going to call u a rapper u are an artists
Loved the message man
I don’t understand how anyone can dislike a song like this, sorry it’s not anyone it’s just cold hearted basement trolls that doesn’t understand how it feel to have someone you go through cancer. Nice song Tom
Its give a goosebumps..we should know about humanity, every single words here is very previous ❣️...love frm india and huge respect bruh it touches our heart!!!
A rapper taking on the billion dollar pharmacology industry? This is new.
goddamn man. i purposely didnt watch this at first to prepare myself. it didnt help. i am just crying and crying. fuck cancer. i love you grandma.
Ya know i wasnt a fan when i seen you getting at mac lethal but honestly... Bro you are fire as fuck 💚 this video hit some feels i didn't remember i had
The type of Conscious hip-hop also desperately needed among this every song autotune blah blah blah gibberish with no message more content like this Could help bring Hiphop back
“We are paying them to kill us “ that hit home, well done Tom, big words from a big heart
Cancer is caused by vaccines, that’s why so many people for years and years get cancer because it’s injected in you. It’s in all the vaccines
To much truth man. I wish every rapper had no fear when it comes to there topics. Keep talking truth Tom!
Ah tom. Ive had stage 3 plus... my personal war ... my little girl was 5... i fort wiv every bone in my body . Shes 18 now i love every day n scared i know it will come back one day. I cried . Luv u tom n nova ... xxxxxx
So it took me a few days to be able to really hear this song. I found out about 3  months ago I have hodgkin's lymphoma stage 3 they seen a few spots they need to look more into after a biopsy on my neck and 7 from my boobs I found out Friday I need to have both breast removed and even doing that nothing but lots of fighting can save my life.  Yes I know I sound very defeated and yes I am. But I love the song because your right cancer sucks and maybe just maybe there is still a little hope in the darkness.
My brother was a big fan of yours. We lost him to cancer last year. He had his leg amputated back in 2018 and seemed to be doing fine afterwards but it came back and infected his lungs the following year. He was the strongest person I ever knew. No matter what kind of shit life threw at him he always remained positive. I'm sure he would've loved to hear this
Romans 10:9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. JESUS SAVES, JESUS IS GOD MANIFEST IN THE FLESH WHO TOOK OUR PUNISHMENT OF SIN AND DIED IN OUR PLACE, THAT IN HIM WE ARE RIGHTEOUS NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DO, BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID, HE ROSE AGAIN FROM THE DEAD, AND LIVES FOREVERMORE, AND HE WILL COME AGAIN SOON!!! PUT YOUR FAITH AND TRUST IN JESUS TODAY, AND ILL SEE YOU IN HEAVEN, LOVE YOU GUYS!!!♥️♥️✝️✝️🇮🇱🇮🇱
Got cancer when I was 17 and still in high school and working almost full time. Shit sucked, first in my family as well. None of my grandparents or even great or greatgreatgrandparents have had cancer
This should be the theme song for WV, almost all of us get cancer. Thanks Monsanto/DuPont!
was i the only one who genuinely thought he was gonna troll people and call them cancer...now i kinda feel bad for thinking like that.
Man I put tom right next to em for sure
WOW, this touched my heart so heavy. As a cancer survivor and watching others dying from it. My loved ones are worth more than this government seems to think.  You are an amazing, gifted and talented young man.  I don't care for hip hop but you.........I could listen to all day. Thank you Tom.
Outstanding
The cure is the food stupids you are the cancer learn the sickness
cancer has taken a lot of people, my grandma hid away the news that my dad(step dad) had gotten treatments before my mom met him and that he was getting treatments for it again. i never knew it before last year.....to say the least i'm so happy his still around kicking. FUCK CANCER
As serious as this message is, I feel the beat production is a bit lacking.
we will never give up
i will cry
Well done Tom❤️
This is some Mickey Mouse shit.
Love this one especially, hard hitting song. Lost my grandma to stage 4 cancer out of nowhere in 2017, 6 months after my cousin committed suicide. Seeing someone you love deteriorate in a matter of months into someone you don’t recognize... those memories never leave you. I’m so thankful my mom is a breast cancer survivor, for I wouldn’t have the slightest idea where I would be without either one of these amazing ladies in my life. Prayers to anyone else going through these battles, hang in there. You’re all so strong!!!❤️
Dude.........
WOW!!! Lost my Dad Last Year to Cancer. I watched the Strongest man I Have Ever known Slowly Whiter away...My Hero ...Fought til the Very End..even thonthis Song Makes me Cry and want to scream at the same time....Thank U Tom!! It is a Beautiful Song....just wish my dad was here to Hear it!!   HOG 4 LIFE.....
Im not crying you’re crying. Oct 23 will be 7yrs since I lost my mom to stage 4 pancreatic cancer. The wound never heals. Thoughts and prayers going out to everyone that has been affected by this sickness! Much love to all!!!! ❤️
Tom MacDonald is one of the most honest rappers there is in the game..
Dam Tom, my mom's a cancer server, song brought me to tears everyone hell of an artist Tom keep up the good work thanks for everything
Tom, good music here tho, I've got my ears on you since you came out with Wannabe. I'm from Romania by the wa but based in London, your music goes way behind the USA borders! I don't know if you read this but damn! Well done
Hey bro just want to say keep making your music you're a legend in the making can't wait to hear your next song
This mcdonald's ad it's so deep!
💞💞💞💞🔥✊💬
https://youtu.be/CKQT68VnOkQ
Yaaaassss King!!! 😎😜🙌🏻
Sad that they have cures for cancer but won’t apply them or make it public. Seems like everyone who was going to come out with the cures mysteriously died.
I’ve lost someone who meant a lot to me from cancer. This is soo powerful. Thank You Tom Macdonald.
It's all about how much money they can make I believe they have a cure
So inspiring. Tears here in the UK  Bro. I'm not much of a.commentor but I just had to give kudos for this tune. Your an amazing poet ✌😭
Bone marrow cancer. Rest well granny
All the rappers these days are rapping about girls money and drugs Tom MacDonald is a good man and a good rapper keep doin what your doin man I wish someday I could rap with ya🤟👌
Do you ever release a bad song? I mean for real, everything I hear from you is awesome!  Edit: my mom was diagnosed with Breast Cancer 2 days after i made this comment. I needed this song more than even i knew at the time of my comment.
This song really hits home hard cause my grandfather died from cigarette cancer in 2007 when I was 5 and my grandmother died from breast cancer in 2013 when I was 12.
the beest tomm
This song touched me so much I remember being seven years old and lying in that bed going through Cancer treatments and crying at night Tom you are a genuine rock star man thank you
Powerful song.👍👍 I never got the chance to meet my grandmother because she died from cancer back in the 50's when my mother was about 3-4 year old. #fuckcancer
❤
This song doesn't have to be directed towards only cancer but self harm too
Hitting home, my mom has got cancer. Im just happy i can see her smile still today
Dang Tom you got my feelings going dude, 3am here watching this for first time at the edge of my bed while my 37 Year old wife is asleep fighting stage 4 colon cancer, thank you for this song means a lot 👍😎👍
*I had a family member and cancer that took him, Live On Brother*
You can say what you want about tom but this song is for everybody.
Tom & Nova, I'm Brendan, I'd love to talk to you. Your mind is like pandoras box, except when you open, its positive. Also you seem smart and willing to actually talk about important issues and make change.
Damn dude it's been a minute since a song has hit me like that.
This is 17 on trending and the number one video trending is a woman mixing nail polish to make, 1 color, go back to your second grade books look at the color wheel and you will figure it out red + blue = purple, yet that is trending more than this real message that's why this country is where it is.
Listened to Tom from day 1 his tunes are so powerful and meaningful keep up the good work bruv
Just wow and I am in tears knowing that they are young kids who are going through this and how many lives are shorted and lost to keep this multi billion dollar industry
This one got me right in the feels.
How in the fuck does this song hav over 2k dislikes??? 1 of the most powerful songs I've heard in some time.
Donate to cancer research or demonetize woke king 👑 😌
🔥🔥💨💨🤙😁
I truly hope you reach your dreams you are a pure gift your writing impeccable it's not filled with filth or putting down women, men , gays, or killings of  police!  Your just really,  really, really, gifted the only rapper I like thank you!!  This  song about cancer was needed I'm in remission blessings to all stay safe out there everyone...
Lost my grandma when I was 6 to cancer...she was my bestfriend....my life would have been so different if she didn't die....I wouldnt be lost....😔 love you g.patty
Heal me Lord and I will be healed, save me Lord and I will be saved. For you are my praise. Jeremiah 17:14  🙏   We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness , and to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 NKJV ❤️📖🙂
Your amazing! Such an true and amazing song.
Tom you're killing me. One of my loved ones had it, recovering now! If we could only find out if they're actually hiding the cure from us!
Vote Trump.  He’ll fix it.  12 more years!
Best rapper alive ever, your lyrics beat them all. 🤙
Thank you from germany! You are a genius <3
Always dislikes are from tobacco companies
"You won't know why you have faith, until you look the devil in his face"...  🙏🤝🏼
No Tom, covid is the real concern!
🙏
This song it's like a freight train of emotions.... It brought back all the pain from the chemo but also the joy of getting over the 8 moths of it (4 years since) . . For all those who are going through this : be strong,keep your head up and NEVER EVER GIVE UP ON LIFE! Sending all the love ❤️ possible from Romania 🇷🇴 to you mister Tom! God bless you! Thank you for your support! Peace ✌️
Goosebumps all I feel is goosebumps! 🤐
I've done chemo, damn I always feel bad for the old people who have to do it cos it was mostly annoying
This hits the spot of feels.. My dad died last year 2 cancer but I will love him nd ur 🎵 always Tom ironically his name was also Tom
You have my respect, Tom MacDonald!!! I lost my father due to cancer when I was 9. I am 34 now, but the loss is un-measurable and stays with you always. My family lost my Aunt to stomach cancer about a year ago as well. Shortly after my Grandmother passed away, not from cancer though. 🙏🏼 I apologize for the dark or gloomy comment... I just wanted you to know your music is being appreciated and helps those that need it the most. Thanks, Tom. #TomMacDonaldLivingLegend #FuckCancer
#fuckcancer  My mother died a month ago after fighting 5 years. Many surgeries, many chemos, several clinical trials. She was a lot stronger of a woman than I will ever be a man. Having said this, if all cancer had a cure they would release it. They would still make money. And there are many researchers out there working for a cure. Hopefully some day.
Going through my oral chemo treatment right now to treat a non cancerous tumor in my knee so I couldn’t imagine what those who do radiation feel hopefully they see this song and it gives them some strength
My dad has cancer , I’m a alcoholic , I have a million raps and songs . I’m Canadian . Can you help a brother out....
Love you.
.ok so first off this is dope!! and secondly im currently throwing everything ive got into my music, i am a father of 3 recording music out of my family home i recording like this because i believe although im no dr dre i can mix my music good enough for people too hear my music and get an understanding of wether you like it or not, i found my father dead after he committed suicide and it sent me on a mad spiral this turned into expressing my feelings into music although not everyone has gone through this we have all lost someone we either love or care deeply about, in toll means we are not alone all my music is made with pain emotion love and sadness and i believe a lot of people can relate to this, i don’t use my youtube but i uploaded daily on my sound cloud here https://soundcloud.com/preemobandz  i would appreciate it alot if just one person would take a listen im currently trying to turn my negative experience with life into something positive and i cant do it alone if you could just take a look it would mean ALOT
This song  hits hard brother love from New Zealand ❤
Wow great
Serious Legend... These Lyrics are so true to so many people..  You Get where we're coming from Tom
Making 🇨🇦 proud! Thank you for using your voice to encourage those who need to know they are not alone, this is a very powerful song. Good on you brother. 🙏🏻
Tom...you are a gift!!!
Man this song made me actualy cry💖😔
If Tom didn't have the face tats he'd probably already have a Grammy imo no disrespect intended just society rejects things like that at first glance. We're supporting him regardless and it's going to be a beautiful moment when we get him to the point where they can't ignore him as a legend over even mainstream music his messages are true and it's going to be evident that he's one of a kind artist whose always been putting out messages showing the fake side of industry and other positive messages and opens his whole past 100 percent truthful to his fans and we love him for that. I hope with everything good I have left one day Tom makes it to the very top in the  hall of  fame.
I  am glad I haven’t had anybody I love have go through this must be hard to live through this
WOW, just Wow, hard truths that need to be said, you are giving everyone a voice Tom and i respect you for that. Keep up the great work and thank you for being you.
REPEAT
Couldn't you have hired someone with cancer instead of putting a girl in an obvious bald cap?
I'm not crying your are 😭
You absolute legend tears 😭 covid19 is taking over cancer patients are pushed aside it's painfull
Omg 😥😢🙏🏻 beautiful and heartbreaking and brutally honest 10000% amazing as always #shared xxx
Wow, thank you for this song. Also, I appreciate that it wasn't vulgar or inappropriate.
Only positive criticism I can make is to use a heartbeat for the beat of the song... it'll carry so much more effect along with the lyrics.
0:00 not going to lie im scared to watch or listen to this. I feel terrible for saying it. But im going to because people are suffering and if they can fight I can watch a music video xx #HOGlove
Cancer is complicated that's why curing it is hard.. Say if we find a cure for lung cancer that won't mean we found a cure for all cancer. Also not all cancer gets massive donations..
Are the albums that are for sale on your website CDs or LPs?
Tom, I just posted this on facebook for my Aunt Carol who is fighting cancer right now. I hope you don't mind I did so, something tells me that you wouldn't mind because it's the reason you wrote the song in the first place. Thank You Tom. I've listened to this now 5 times. I lost an Aunt and Grandfather to cancer years ago now, but seeing what it did to them both still hurts.
I don't have cancer although I've witnessed the heartache from it from people close to me that did and didn't make it... but something that's also horrible is being diabetic.  The struggles of both are relentless and terrifying both physically, mentally and financially. Wouldn't wish these things on my worst enemy or their families.  Coming from someone who constantly fears the worst daily, suffering from a disease with no cure and suffering from complications from which... knowing one day that it will ultimately kill you is horrible. This song hit close and I thank you for this song... im actually a die hard metal/hard rock guy but your music is awesome and I don't typically listen to this kind of music but I like your style so thank you tom! Keep up the good work!!
I'm terminally and this gives me hope. Please follow my brother his video is "boxes on boxes" by Star.. it would mean the world to me to see him make it before i pass away. I love you all
Cringe
2.3k dislikes what the fuck show Tom Macdonald some love not hate he is a real one to the game he puts in the work day in day out to give us something to really think about love your music Tom & Nova you guys are truly inspiring 🤘🏻HangOverGang4Life🤘🏻
That was truly a amazing song thank you tom for making this song its amazing for all the sick an they need to hear this it is truly an amazing song
I spent 2 years watching my wife die of cancer. I spent 4 times that long, trying to understand what happened. I dug deep. I read a lot. I spent half a decade not doing anything but eat, sleep, and try to figure this out. In the end, what I learned is this.  There's no secret cure, nobody's 'milking the sick'. We just haven't figured it out yet. I believe some day we will, we're just not there yet.
Nice
TO EVERYONE STILL FIGHTING, DON'T BACK DOWN, NEVER STOP FIGHTING. YOU HAVE THE KIND OF STRENGTH YOU CANNOT BUILD IN A GYM.
Wise and well spoken words. I ride for Sick Kids Hospitals, 1500km rides on a bike. I grow my hair to just crop it all off for wigs(more redheads ahhh hahahaha), it helps the kids feel like being kid without being looked at. I'm 50, not a big rap fan, but you have something I enjoy. Keep the work going
Your the one
Beautiful♡  I've had many in my family who've had cancer and all died from it. My aunt was the strongest woman I ever knew. Battled breast cancer twice and beat it then ended up with liver and lost the battle. I get so scared sometimes that I may get it or my mother and the scariest thought it that one day I'll have a child who gets it. I definitely feel like there is a cure out there and it needs to be released.  Hopefully. Someday. Thanks tom for sharing your passion and for writing such beautiful, meaningful songs. You are unlike anyone else. And its amazing! Keep up all the good, hard work!  Much much love ♡
https://youtu.be/IiBVigt_BPw
This absolutely needs millions of views and listens. This should be on the radio people need to hear this❕❕
Love this song so much listen to it twice and cried both times
It’s not even fathomable that there are rappers out there that have so much “ clout “ and attention when Tom is literally blessing us with his music. People that hate on Tom must have a crazy amount of insecurities because there’s nothing to hate. When you listen to Tom there’s one thing you’re always promised and that is that it’s going to be raw. Protect this man at all costs. #hangovergang
2.5k people disliked this needs to go somewhere! This man is a legend
My wife lost her uncle back in March after a 2 year battle with cancer. I lost a good friend last month. Thank you for such a powerful song.
If anyone is, or knows someone, who is battling cancer, they may be interested in a successful but hidden treatment. Good luck 🙏 https://youtu.be/UqQTxV-ks7g
Wow I stumbled across this and it’s powerful. Respect 💯
By far my favorite song of yours hits me right in the feels man
Nobody gets out of life alive.
This is your best song so far dude! I've lost a dozen loved ones to cancer. One of the two most important women in my life just started round two. Shes 82 years old and she's my grandmother. The only saving grace is we are Canadian. She can fight it without the added stress of the huge financial burden that comes along with it , like our cousins in the US must endure. Fucking heartbreaking man. Keep doing you Tommy, the people need you!
Man, this hits different. Two years ago my mom was diagnosed with cancer and last year she passed away, it took a lot to watch but I wanted to be as much with her as I still can. I wasnt there when she passed, my little sister was. I miss her so much
Goddamn Tom, I always love your messages , but this one man.............this ones beautiful! I love how you say what so many try to say and so many more want to say. Keep speaking the truth Tom. love Ya Bro. Many Canadians, myself being one, are very proud of you for what you're doing.   Keep Safe All, Peace, Happiness, Love and Laughter, -Matt
Hit me hard bro.. Watched yesterday but too busy crying to give respect.
Cancer took my mom. Thank for this song bro 🙏
You Tom are a fucking legend. Expose the BS.
😭😭😭 such a great song.
What an ugly man
A friend of mine who means the world to me is fighting not only his own battle, but one for his mothers too,  she has a rare cancer that they cant locate, hes a wreck and i cant help him, but maybe he will hear this song and can fight abit harder for his mom.
Tom is a legend in the making! This hits deep!
For the longest time I had the same questions about the Cancer industry worth billions of dollars and decades of research and still nothing more advanced than chemotherapy 🤔   Cancer is so horrible, my heart truly goes out to any family affected 😔
This song makes me want to cry, but I can't. My great-grandfather died 5 years ago, of lung cancer. I made one promise to him, that I intend to keep forever, and that was to be strong. He was a WWII vet, and was the most loving person I've ever known. He didn't care who you were, he would treat you as family. I strive to be like him everyday. He was humble, kind, caring, etc. We need more of that these days.  To whomever sees this comment, keep your head up. Things will get rough, but every valley, has a hill, and that hill has a peak. Life is no smooth ride.  I recently got into a very bad motorcycle accident. I was in the ER for three days. I had road rash covering 70% of my body, as well as a broken hip. When it was time for me to start walking again, it hurt, not just physically, but emotionally. It felt like I died a little bit that day, I haven't felt the same since. I wish people in this world would be more caring to others. Because if someone wouldn't have stopped the traffic... I wouldn't be making this comment. Life is scary, I admit it, but you need to loom for the silver lining. I promise you will find it, I love you all ❤️❤️❤️❤️. If anyone wants to talk about anything, I'm here for you, my Instagram is (@happy_deadly_shimada). Feel free to contact me anytime! ❤️❤️  P.s - A dream come true would be Tom/Nova seeing this comment
This is so true. God bless all who are going through this. I just lost my.dad to an infection after an open heart surgery. You would think they would.know how to.keep people alive in this lifetime. 2020 is just fucking terrible.
You speak the truth bro. Your lyrics are at an another level, and your  technique in story telling is majestic. Keep it up. Love from Australia 🙏👍
I lost my grandfather 14 years ago to liver cancer! RIP Grandpa #CancerSucks
Are you willing to change the world?
the people who disliked this video are so cold and stupid 😟😟😟
It is STILL NOT TOO LATE FOR YOU!!!   If you were to die today are you 100% certain you know where you’ll end up?  The bad news: We are all sinners with a fallen nature. No sin is greater or worse than any other, sin is sin. God is a Holy God and he cannot allow not even 1 sin into heaven.  “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God”  The good news,  If Jesus could ask his Father to forgive those who tortured, mocked, blasphemed and crucified him what makes you think he won't forgive you!?   The Gospel:  Jesus paid for our sins so that we might be saved, nothing we can do on this earth can ever save us.  Ephesians 2:8-9“For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”  “Romans 3:20-26 “Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.”  How to be saved?  As a repentant sinner Look into your heart and confess: Dear God I am a wretched sinner, as I repent I put my faith that Jesus is God and that he died buried and resurrected so that his blood can wash away my sins I put my faith in that alone to save me not my good works in Jesus name I pray Amen.  Romans 10:9-10 "That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved."
My grandfather passed away of liver cancer this year, his liver was so large he couldn't eat and he was allergic to the treatment... so I was forced to watch him pass away in my living room on hospice just like his wife... he cried because the medicine we gave him was the same kind that he gave grandma when she was passing away... I miss them both every day but I know that grandpa was so happy when he got to heaven to see the love of his life again... I really love this song and if you read this Tom MacDonald I love you and everything you stand for never stop being you ❤ God bless you
Pop up before this "who cried after watching the video"?  Me clicking the vid and seeing title. Ahh shit here we go
LEGEND! My brother died from cancer last Dec. this hits home for me man. Thanks for another banger!
Here's a long but hopefully educational comment:  Tl:dr: Developing new cancer treatments in like simultaneously finding a needle in a haystack while wondering a forest blind. You're looking for the gene mutation that caused the cancer without really knowing what the patients genome is supposed to look like, where the DNA got messed up at that changed a gene, or what combination of genes lead to the cancer. And keep in mind, the human genome is huge. An international team of scientists in labs all around the world were assigned what they called "small dna segments" for decoding but the human genome is so big that it still took about 30 years to complete the project.   So! Cancer treatment actually isn't an easy thing to go about and I would know because I am both a cancer patient and someone trying to go to pharmacy school to get into cancer treatment research.  Let's start with the general statement that there are many different types of cancer but cancer can be generally thought of as a cell that underwent an event that messed up a piece of DNA. Usually that piece of DNA is a gene that codes for a protein that are used in the cell signal to stop cell division.  Now you would think this would be something easy to study right? Sounds simple and today's technology is faster and better then ever before right? Well, you are very wrong. Sure, technology has advanced like crazy especially since the early 70's when scientists first started looking into genetics and how it relates to diseases, but advanced technology doesn't mean much if you can't figure out what you need it to look for. To know what to look for in the development of treatments for cancer, one must first know how a cell becomes cancerous. Here are a few ways a cell can become cancerous that I can remember off the top of my head: 1) There are mechanisms in your body that purposely change DNA to allow greater genetic variety that could lead to the development of a cancerous gene (RAG proteins are proteins in your body that do this and it literally allows the function of one half of your immune system). 2) Then there is the possibility of an error occuring during DNA scrambling during normal cell division.  3) There are also proteins that are supposed to copy your DNA exactly that accidently mess up by either using the wrong DNA base, adding a DNA base where there shouldn't be one, or deleting a DNA base. 4) There are proteins who's job is to cut up DNA to get rid of bad pieces that either don't work or work too well.  5) There are environmental factors like UV light damaging DNA, toxins that your own body produces and uses to try and keep you healthy that can destroy DNA, or chemicals that people ingest that damage DNA.   Remember, damaged or destroyed DNA can lead to cancer and any of the 3.something trillion cells in your body can become cancerous everyday by one of the ways I listed.  "But if DNA being damaged or messed up can cause cancer in any of my trillions of cells everyday, why isn't cancer more prevalent?" might be you next question. Well that leads into reason number two that cancer research for new treatments is a giant cluster.  Messed up DNA isn't always reflected in your genes. And even if a gene does get messed up, that's no guarantee that a disease will come about. The truth is there is still a lot about genes and genetics that we just don't know. Sure we've decoded a genome and sure we now have genetic testing. But the truth is, what we know about the genome and genetics is a drop of water compared to what we don't know. As a species we have only decoded one person's entire genome from a single cell. DNA varies from one cell to another because some cells are specialized and some cells have undergonen some of those DNA changing events I mentioned earlier (that are natural processes your cells just do). In fact, geneticist are still discovering what genes do and how the expression of different combinations of genes leads to diseases. Also, as a side note, any genetic testing you've seen in recent years only looks at a larger picture of the chromosomes rather then each DNA strand and it's sequence of bases. So genetics is a stupidly complicated science that we haven't even fully decoded or understand. Which means scientist need more time to properly study the genome and genetics in order to produce any sound medicine from it. A process we have begun in really well studied diseases like down syndrome or chronic myeloid leukemia but until all diseases are well studied there will be a lack in our ability to use genetics in medicine.  Which leads to the last reason development of new cancer treatments are stupidly complicated. Medicine or treatment development has always been and will always be a high risk business. The scientists and doctors who work in cancer treatment are literally dealing with someone's life and they have to be extremely cautious. This means most doctors will use a halfway effective treatment plan with a long history rather then a new treatment plan that only showed promising results one or two times. Which means more time is needed in order for treatments to be approved for use.  An example of this is the miracle drug for CML patients, Imatinib. Drug developers started testing Imatinib in 1996 as a treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia. It wasn't approved to be used as a treatment until 2001. It took five years of experiments and trails to get a drug approved for one of the most well studied leukemias in the world.   All three of these reasons make cancer treatment a complicated issue. And that degree of complication makes cancer treatment a field that uses a lot of time and resources. But with seemingly so little results, people begin to question the validity of the field just because they didn't get a nice pretty cure-all drug. But the truth is that cancer treatment development right now is more like when the lightbulb was first being invented. There were a lot of failures at first but each failure led the inventor closer to getting it right. Cancer research is the same. We don't have all the answers just yet but we're learning a lot as we go. Scientists just need more time.
greatest song uve ever made hands down
Sori rauno etten voi mitään
Damn, Im 28 and have my second open heart surgery scheduled for this Friday, the 23rd of October I believe. This song hits hard. Love is everything.. . . Hope the best for everyone. Love more hate less  HOG

SAD AF BUT THIS IS REAL AS FUCK AND YESSSSS THEY HAVE A CURE!
🙏
My husband was diagnosed with brain cancer June 2020, a week before he turned 32 years old. Thank you for this song. Forget covid, cancer is the real enemy. Follow our story: https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-kevin-hodges-battle-brain-cancer
This hits me hard!!! My mother had breast cancer..
That's too much man. I love how he tells it like it is. This man is a genius, love you Tom! Keep it up my brotha
I lost my best friend my dad he was the best most honest man I’ve ever known his loyalty was bar none he was a son a soldier a brother a father a uncle cousin then was a grandfather Nd a great grandfather his honor was great but he was also human though so the cancer got him chipped away day after day I felt like I was on the same plain I grew weaker everyday also from the pain of losing my best friend my pop this had to be a nightmare he grew to weak to even go to the bathroom this cancer was far to great to over come the chemo the meds the radiation surgery nothing worked in fact seem to make it worse so he passed away 2 days after Christmas Nd oh his granddaughters birthday cancer sux man it don’t discriminate it is was always a serial killer it kills most everything it encounters F**K CANCER!
You dont just speak your truth, you speak THE truth!! Thank you for this song.
Im lost fer words ill have a comment tomorrow  WOW just WOW
😢
Well done Brother, my Mother fought the battle of bone cancer for her little shining light, her only grandchild, my daughter, My Father told me after my Mother was called home that my daughter was her light to the bitter end and she fought the Devil himself to see her make her 13th birthday. Your song will forever be her battle cry................Thank  you!
Nice work bro. Beautiful
Lost my youngest to cancer at 14 months. We didn't even know he had it till 1 year old.
Lovely story turning into a beautiful music
I left a dislike 😎🤣😂
He spit some real shit. That what Chris rock said the money is not in the cure the money is in the medicine
Thank you. With the 1yr anniversary of my brother in law's passing from cancer. This song was needed. He kept apologising to me as if he was a burden while I sat by his bed for a week. I kept telling him family is never a burden. I miss him every day.  Watching people die from cancer is the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I did it with my father in law and now my brother in law. I never left their sides. No one deserves to fight or die alone! I pray anyone fighting cancer wins their battle and to those who have love ones who have lost that battle I pray you find peace and comfort. I know it's not easy.
This guy thinks he’s so right so annoying
Cancer is from Mass exposure to high frequency. It creates cancer in the body.  Frequency pollution is all Around us. And it's getting worse.
bro 🙌
Soursop fruit
Cancer is curable. You MUST seek the TRUTH to find it. The truth is not for everyone. It is ONLY for those who SEEK IT. *I* have cancer. *I* have a had a natural breakthrough, but I underestimated cancer's tenacity and backslid within hours of that breakthrough. I'm regrouping, but my NEXT one-on-one with cancer will be my PERMANENT VICTORY b/c I *HAVE* figured it out. Doctors have only ever managed to do ONE THING competently: BILL ME. They helped me to understand that they are NOT there to cure serious illness. That's when I took matters into my own hands. God has been with me THE ENTIRE TIME. It's not as hard to beat as the medical INDUSTRY would have you believe. It WILL cost you thousands, and it WILL take months, but you WILL beat it. And through the process, you will LEARN and then KNOW that the medical and drug industries are TOTAL CRIMINAL SCAMS. Thank you so much, Tom MacDonald. I've never been much of a fan of rap, but you are dropping TRUTH BOMBS on the masses and anyone who does that is a friend of mine. If you would be interested in doing a follow up to this song, I would be happy to share everything I know about it; how most people get it, and how to beat it and you could get the word out b/c very few listen to me. I'm beginning to think most people don't want to hear the truth or just don't recognize the sound of it. But you have a way with communication that seems to be effective.
I love you brother. No one wants to leave here I know, I know as much as I fear leaving I know there’s something after this. The lord speaks through so many bro. He is waiting for us all patiently yet we all arrive at the same time. A huge city a bunch of familiar faces for everybody god in all his grace and glory at the center. Those who are believed to go to hell I believe will be cleansed completely different people upstairs yet live far away from the city and after meeting the lord they’ll walk to the small mountains in the distance where the city still appears massive from and they’ll be planning a trip back to the lord first thing once home. Putting them in pilgrimage to see the lord. All the priests truth sayers and musicians leading praise to the lord as we all sing along. I see truth speaking musicians as priests. Lord loves you all, can’t wait to rock out in heaven with all the greats. Ya boy a legend poet amongst legends yeah he knows it, I’m boutta overgrow it, the project, gonna blow it into something really(fkn) massive, even bigger than the state, cus the vision looking great under son, don’t be late, I pass the dinner plate yeah we all just ate, I love you all the same, I’ll you at the gate of heaven got a date, she cute n she won’t skate, we’re working with new slates, together we’re soul mates.
Hey man you know that rebuilding your DNA is not that easy and checking every sell in you body is not just rediculos its almost impossible and on top of that the cost well by way to high for anyone hell even the top 1% would have some troubles
Love it. My great grandma passed away from cancer back in 17. Brought a tear to my eye. Keep up the good work man I love your music.
This is true Hip hop Salute from the Old Head OG raised on political rap
❤ oh my God that was an amazing song!! Prayers going out to all those struggling all those fighting and all the survivors, second round of prayers going out to everyone!
Damn man so much truth its so sad how the world is i wish it would just get a restart
I've never liked this genre of music but my friend sent this to me as I lost a family recently to cancer and this truly hits home. Each lyric is the fucking truth.
Breast cancer  took my mother from me back in 93 i was 13 im 40 now and being there and seeing what she went thru. this woman is my hero till this day
My grandmother has cancer and she has beat it 2 times and it came back again and the doctor said she would be lucky to make it to Thanksgiving. But she is 81 years old she has lived her life.
Shit hurts
Thank you God
Absolutely amazing. ❤
Thank you Tom and Nova for counting to push the world to believe again.  To touch points on the topics that truly  meaningful.  Cancer seems to hit a lot of people in the world.  Thank you Tom.  Hopefully I'll get to tell you my family story.
This man deserves so much more recognition. Love this❤️
dude is lost
I hate my family for all they have done to me
wow
😶 speechless first time i heard this, tom macdonald you the GOAT bro. Here you dropped this 👑
Thank you Tom!
A potential cure is B17 by the company Apricot Power please spread it Another one that has been used by my former doctor who got "suicided" for exposing big pharma (Dr Jeff Bradstreet) is called GCMAF [gc protein  derived macrophage activating factor], it is naturally made in all of us but was found to be supressed by the huge levels of the acidic protein a "nagalase" coming from a vaccine Jeff used in the study.  Gcmaf is very hard to obtain now but there are ways to get some in a more lower level strength form like home produced gcmaf yogurts and creams.  I wish all of the cancer fighters good luck and God bless. Keep fighting and win, we are in this together.
What a fucking legend! Good job and keep on going my man!!!
I’ve been fighting brain cancer for 8 years on and off. Im four years in remission now And the doctor finally said I’m cancer free. Best song speaking about the truth of this disease
They have the CURE FOR CANCER. They just DON'T want to give it because they profit from the drugs they sell. So sad. So inhumane...... But the industry and some Drs don't care.  They just are about the money they can make off your illnesses. 😡☹
This isn’t hiphop.  He’s now singing.  He will follow the same path as Kid Rock, Yelawolf, Uncle Kracker and MGK.
Back in January of 2011 my grandfather died had already been batteling cancer and the primary family Dr failed to get a second opinion to make sure he didn't have any more cancer left in him....to this day i still have vivid memories of him being rolled out on a gerny to the morgue with a blanket over his lifeless body and it hurts everytime i think about him God rest his loving soul the man had a heart of gold....he also was like a father to me as well cause my biological father wasn't really in the picture but thats another story....Grandfather if you can hear me.....I love you
Respect !!!
hE SAYING TRUTH !!!!
The 5G towers man, they cause cancer.
The 2.3 thousand that hated tis song have no hearts or souls thank you for this song Tom I've lost so many loved ones to cancer and this song had me in tears hits my very soul man thank you so much
I don't know how you do it over and over again? Simply Amazing! Thank you!
This song should have so many more views. Cancer has touched everyone in some way. Powerful Tom. Much love brother
One word: TRUTH
2.3k people who dislike this have no emotions
This song hits home. We lost our first born Son to cancer. Born with Infantile Fibrosarcoma. We spent his whole life at Seattle Children's Hospital. 5 months and we were never able to take him  home. That was 10 years ago. not a day goes by that i still don't think about him.
This really hits me hard since I lost my father to cancer and my mother is fighting it a second time
This song hits home for so many reason , my wife who is a 2 time survivor my uncle who’s been battling his for 8 yrs now and still going strong , brotha thank u for this song, much love and respect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1KPv7mY2Dk
Cringe fringe
This has gotta be my favorite Tom, great job, hope to see you again soon
my grandpa and uncle both died from cancer 😭😢 my grandpa had pancreatic and my uncle had brain they said my grandpa would only last 6 months but he lasted 18 months 🥰 I'm not sure about my uncle 😭😢 I miss and 💖 them both everyday 💖 the music video very well done 🥰 I had to rewatch the video its so good brought tears to my eyes made me think of my grandpa and uncle 💖 I downloaded this song after hearing it
My mom died of cancer when I was 21 years old just over 5 yrs ago now sat with her by her bed side tell 3am went home to my wife and kid and got a call an hour later that she was passing away I never got to say goodbye then 2 or three years later a band called we three made a tribute song to there mother and now this song you made it's like my mom's trying to tell me some thing but idk what
So uh she ruined a perfectly good wig. Damn.
We have the cure to cancer. But we keep killing it. But god keeps sending it again and again. But then we kill it again. I’m pro-life.
Man you are amazing been alot of people close to me this year passing away from cancer literally lost a friend classmate 3 days ago FUCK CANCER keep it real you and nova are amazing people great role models HOG for life.🙏
My dad beat cancer im thankfull every day :)
Not every cancer is a life lost,,,we hear you
Beautiful! Grandma died of cancer. This hits home
Props on this song! 💝
Not even going to lie. This song had me in tears. I have a dear friend that is battling an incurable form of cancer. She is only 39 years old and a mother of 5.
Tears flowing here bro
Goddess bless all the ones left behind who love all those taken too young for us all... 💗💕💗
Damn good tune, I like that shit
My mother beat cancer 2 years ago but sadly this year we lost our aunt, my moms sister, to cancer. I love this song Tom, in fact I enjoy all of your music, thank you for all the hard work you put in.
I didn't expect from the hype but you seemed genuine with your message..so I checked out and first drop my whole body bumped all up,face went wet. You see apathy has been my main stay to keep my depression at bay trying not to care in these times. But the power in the words,music,your voice, the imagery. I broke dude. I lost it. I dont know whether to say thankyou for letting me feel again or hug you as I would for the ones Ive lost. Too many to count in my aging body. My childhood best friend I knew growing up at age 21 was my first. Diagnosed with Hodgkin's while she was pregnant 21 also. She had her baby thats 30 now who only gets to hear how wonderful her mother was. How she looks just like her and acts like her. Then family members,my best friends, close co workers still young,even old. Damn! My pup! Friends that are going thru it with their loved ones sick. How long the list must I go?! You got me thinking of life and doing something about it then just stare at the tops of my shoes! One day. But alot of truth in it. Peace all and embrace your loved ones.⚘🕊
I’ve been in HOG since the beginning and I got the notification for your new song but it took me a day to be able to listen to it. Today is exactly two months since I lost my dad to terminal lung cancer, and I watched him go through all of it. Thank you Tom for being the greatest rapper alive and for keeping me inspired to keep moving forward! HOG for life ❤️
I just pulled myself together, I almost cried...!
Much love to you!  This hits home, as I lost my beloved brother...
I died in 2013. Docs call it a "PAUSE" Woke up smiling with complete feeling of LOVE! I know..😇👍🌅
downvoted because he really thinks cancer has a cure. i love you tom, but saying cancer ( the most volatile and unpredictable disease ) has a cure. some forms do have a cure. but that is a very small chance. cancer is a defect in our DNA, and nothing can stop it. cut it all out, and hope the new cells don't do the same thing. or go through toxic therapy to try to delay it for as long as possible. that's why breast cancer survivors lose their breasts. because they have to cut it all off, and hope it doesn't come back. I love you tom, your one of my favorites. but fuck, that first verse pissed me off. loved the rest.
My father had leukemia. Passed 14 years ago this Dec. 23. I was only 16 and starting my life....when it was the chemo that caused what took him from us, and I lost someone who could have shown me secrets to living. Found out today that my father's friend & law enforcement partner has leukemia, and going to the same hospital..
Really beautiful. Cancer changes you as well. Some for better, some for worse. I had stage 3 triple negative breast cancer. 6 months of chemotherapy, double mastectomy. I knew two other women with it at the same time. I am the one out of us three that made it.  This past April was my official 5 yrs cancer free.  Changed my life forever. But I am happy, healthy and very grateful for every moment I get.
Just read the lyrics without the music and its phenomenally wrote. Such wicked poetry. Truly unreal. Tom is the Goat. Ain't going to find anything like this from anyone else.
My grandpa died a few weeks ago from cancer
I'm so proud of you Tom I k you live in Cali now But you're still a true Canadian Just listen to your heart it shows! Much love brother!
I lost both parents, two aunts and an uncle to cancer. My younger cousin is fighting right now. This hits hard!!
My oldest son Shawn had cancer ALL when he was 4! I will never forget how the doctor told me! She called me on the phone, mind you my son was in the hospital and I was at the hospital with him! She said your son has cancer and you and him will be going to Marshfield Hospital in marshfield WI by ambulance 🚑 which is 2 hours away! Didn’t even come up to his hospital room to tell me! Who does that?? Well anyway my son is now 21 and doing amazing! Wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy!
God Bless to anyone who is fighting this right now. I don't know you but I send my love to you. Please try to keep your mind out of the dark. <3 You are a hero to me.
Mr. Macdonald I love the way your not afraid to speak ur mind.  Keep up the hard work and thank you to you and your girl nova for getting these kinds of songs out here
I dont got cancer but the chorus has brought a little hope in my life....thx tom macdonald ✌
😇😇😇 thank you 🙏
Absolutely great song. But like you said,  so many thousands of dollars to find a cure,  But yet Corona virus is only a few months away?  Should have put that in.  No cure for cancer after how many billions of dollars and so many doctors ALL coming together? Hello !!  Were really is the cure ? IF THE WHOLE WORLD IS AFFECTED? WERE IS THE DEMAND FOR A CURE?
Lost my mom to pancreatic cancer 20 years ago.. still a hard subject to talk about. Still lost from it
This hits home hard af bro straight fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
My mom has stage 4 cancer, and I fear everyday that it could be her last, she says she fine but how do we really know that the chemo is helping🤷‍♀️ I love my mom and I hope she beats cancers ass
Thank you so much for making this song. It hit home hard bro😭😭😭😭😭😭
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Bro....
I either feels the government wants this guy to send a mesage or try to stop him
Damn dude! I'm straight crying! You have an awesome gift of the right words! Much love!
i lost my pop/step granddad to throat cancer i miss him a lot and also my dad has had stomach cancer he beat that then he got non Hodgkin's lymphoma he beat that now he has a rarer version of non Hodgkin's lymphoma and all so my mom had a brain tumor 18 years ago she got told she had 2 years to live she beat those odd and i am thankful she is still alive and i am thankful my dad is still alive
Everybody knows someone who's sick Forty percent will get cancer, only half's gonna live Your mom and your dad and your sister stand inside a room And someone won't survive it, do you hope it isn't you? I swear that cancer has a cure, but they're refusing to make it They've done like forty years of research, ninety billion in donations We've been running for the cure and wearing ribbons for ages Why are people still going through radiation? It's fucking crazy  Hundred billion-dollar industry, they can't afford to end it And nobody wants to die, our only option is to spend it We give anything to stick around for just another second Give a fortune to the doctors who promise they can extend it The profits are astronomic, the hospital and the clinics Of fillings coffins with dollars, it's awful, let's just admit it We're all human, we'll keep fighting 'cause it's how we survive But it's scary 'cause we don't know where we'll go when we die  Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart  Nothing matters if you don't have your health All the money in the world doesn't help The good might go to Heaven and the bad might go to Hell But no one wants to leave here, you can tell And cancer touches everyone, it's in our genetics And our world's become so toxic, it's all carcinogenic We've polluted the water, the air; the food we're ingesting Is full of hormones and poison, our population's infected They sell us cigarettes and liquor, built a business on addictions We've been paying them to kill ourselves, we're dying to keep living It's the system, it's a prison, we keep trying to beat it We get cancer from keeping all of our demons a secret And our insurance don't cover the things we need to defeat it And even if it does, then we might die from the treatment Our best defence is living like we do not know what cancer is Fight it if you have it and pray that there's something after this  Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart  You won't know how to be brave To choose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength Till you've struggled to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith Till you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take Till you realize you didn't break  Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart
Tom:  "I'm not a candy rapper" Also Tom:
My mom is a cancer survivor. That doesnt take away how painful it was to watch her go through treatment.

Been watching you. Seen videos here and there. Thought you were corny, then you released a song about just that! Now this.....man. I'm liking you more and more. Not a die hard fan..yet, but keep in the booth bruh
Thanks for this. I lost my mom, my dad and my dog to cancer all in the same year. 2015 sucked.
Been living with stage 4 renal cell carcinoma 4 years now. My drug is Votrient 14000 a month to Novartis and Walmart. Does not cure it just slows it. Tons of side effects from the drug not the cancer. Find a cure.
Cancer is created during cell reproduction. Specifically during G2 checkpoints. An error is missed causing the cell to become cancerous. Usually our other healthy cells are really good at identifying and destroying the cancerous cell. However if it is missed it will spread. Whenever you get older your other cells can start to fall behind and fail at destroying the cancer, hence why people usually develop cancer at an older age. For the young people who get it naturally without smoking or any other cancer inducing activities are just extremely unlucky. Smoking can cause cancer because it kills the cells in your lungs causing more cellular reproduction and less thorough checkpoints. So please don't smoke. Just sharing what little information I have on cancer.
Yeah, so, you made me cry. Right now, my best friend of 18 years is going through stage 3 breast cancer, and she just finished her third round of chemo. It's heartbreaking watching her fight this: loss of appetite, constant vomiting, seeing her struggling to do... well, everything. Thank you for this. Seriously.
Last 15 years of my life I lived with my dog taz and my dad, just us 3 against the world, but last year cancer got taz and this year cancer got my dad, now it’s just me, hope to be reunited with both of you again one day ❤️
The dislikes have nothing to do with the song. Its about Tom being a human dumpster fire!
So sad and so true. It's a fucking shame
This song hits me so effing hard. My grandad died in 1978 from cancer, I wasnt even a year old and never knew him but everyone has told me I was HIS BOY since he never had a son, only two daughters. My grandma died in 94 after fighting cancer for 5 years. She was My Katie and I miss her every single day. And my mom died in 2013 after an 18 month battle with cancer. Shit never gets easy to watch those you love whither away to nothing, to the point they arent even recognizable as the person you loved. Much love to all that have lost loved ones and to those that are fighting and have family or loved ones fighting this!!!
You are one cool cat keep in real like you're doing
love the message, it's a sweet one.   but, let's talk about the music a sec, specifically the vocals.   The chorus is fine, and it is actually more than fine. it's pretty catchy. The verses where he raps though, its lacking a bit. (edit* no, it's lacking a LOT) the content of what he is saying is being overshadowed by the lack of any sort of punch. Most rap has some punches in it, this one is full of a bunch of feints. again, it's not the message that is lacking, that part is fine. it's the delivery of that message. that's what is weak in my opinion. that's what needs work.   throw some triplets in there.spice it up rhythmically.   practice your quarter-tone inflections and play around with quarter-tone melody lines.   Rap isnt just about being deep lyrically. there is music underneath it:  heavy emphasis on rhythm, secondary emphasis on pitch (quarter-tone pitch) and lastly lyrics. This priority is how you should build your rap verses. Right now, you have the message (lyrics) at the top of the priority list and that needs to change if you want to keep me interested.   Before you can infect someone's brain with an idea, you have to lure them in with style 1st. The message should be an afterthought.
Cancer to my great uncle James. After being told he caught it and won and died a year later. It came back bigger and badder :( Now his sister is fighting her third round of cancer. She had cancer in her overies and then her lungs and now colon cancer! This song hit hard!  Thank you Tom for going above and beyond
God bless you bro 🙏 Awesome Song 🎵
Love it. I only wish it would've been released in September during Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. Once again a kid is portrayed and October cashes in. Not the first time. Won't be the last. But thank you Tom for hitting it head on.
R.I.P Father & Mother, you will be missed, gotta fight through the pain, y'all can do it to, YOU'RE NOT ALONE, I BELIEVE IN YOU. The good loved ones all you people have lost are legends and legends never die, I hope their souls find peace and so do you.
My grandfather has stage 3 lung cancer and his treatment isnt working...😔😔🥺
Another 1
Beautiful song thank you
I just wanted to thank you for putting real music out there and for having the balls to speak up and sing about true real situations. And thank you Nova for doing so great on the videos
My fiance passed from cancer 2 years ago dec 6th.  Wouldn't do surgery because it was on a major organ. Everytime she got better she got sick from chemo and back to the hospital.....I truly miss her a lot... I do hope anyone going through a though time dealing with this gets help...I never did....
This really just almost had me in tears. We just lost my aunt in August after a 3 year fight with stage 4 kidney cancer. And a good friend of my boyfriend and I has a six year old daughter who is fighting brain cancer currently.
🙏
So off beat
My mom died almost 2 decades ago...from a cancer indigenous to native americans ..she was a 16th Cherokee.
Zzzzz...more trash, except this time it’s stupid dangerous trash. You’re a real a-hole man. This is a dick song designed to get a bunch of people to go aha to a poorly produced derivation of ur rap industry schtick. Let’s monetize cancer. Disgusting. Honestly people wake up. This guy doesn’t care about ur causes. He’s basically putting things into a machine and spitting out what’s the most useful to him. And the actual songs aren’t even decent let alone good. You should be pissed he’s so willing to exploit you like this.
You and Ryan Upchurch should do a song together!
How does this have 2.2k dislikes?
Love this guy
Cancer has affected my life a lot even though I’ve never had it I’ve lost to many close friends and family.
I just lost someone two weeks ago..thank you Tom. I cried thru the whole song/video. Wake up people, this is a strong message  Tom ...you are loved!!!
Amazing song! Touches you on so many levels.
Finally, Tom makes a song discussing his own music. Very meta and cool!
This definitely hit home. My father is battling cancer right now.
Thank you for this one!
My grandma passed away from cancer. I grew up in the system. When I was younger I lost contact with my grandma for three years because I got mad at my grandma. When I finally reached out to her it was to late. She passed away a week later. Sad thing is I didn’t get to tell her I was sorry. I was only 16 and it hurts still.
Fenbendazole
My son and I just watched this together. Neither of us had seen it yet. He beat cancer a couple of years ago. We both cried. This brought back memories. I am so grateful to have him here with me today. He is the strongest kid I know.  A singer and a roll model. He beat it. But we know a lot that haven't from people we have met on this road. Never stop fighting. Never give up. Thank you Tom. Killed it bro.
Bro this is incredible
Damn brother.
We all die, some sooner than others. Repent for the Kingdom of God is at hand.   Romans 6:23 “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
Cancer is a manmade disease & its a billion dollar industry so why would they want to give us the cure! We are literally living in the days of Noah & hell on Earth is upon us all! Thank you for speaking some truth brother!! Bless your heart my friend!! Bet you wont pin this comment!
This song made me cry and bought back up memories of my niece Kayla who fought cancer for 7 year beating 3 different kinds even a stage 4 high grade Brain tumor she lost her fight at the age of 14 😢😭 man was she a fighter and so humble she said it wasn’t the cancer that hurt her it was the pain in the other kids faces that hurt her and broke her heart now because of her my family takes care of children hospital in Washington DC #alwaysfightingforkayla
I didnt think you could be the one to do it tom but you made me cry. Ive lost too many to cancer and I have looked the devil in his eyes and told him he cant hurt me or my family anymore and he will give back all he stole from me. Thank you dude.
amazing song. Man this touched home!!!  My pops has been battling cancer for years now and they keep cutting on him and giving him treatments but it keeps coming back. He is 68 and drives a dump truck every day so he can keep going on in life but it takes so much out of him and to see him struggle but keep going amazes me. I wish I could help him and make him better but I can't and it kills me. It's not just the ones who get sick who need to be strong, we also have to be strong for them even tho it's sooo hard not to just break down. Thank you for making this song tom and nova!
Yeah that's art. Well done. -fellow rapper
I've got several thoughts going through my head about this video. I hope that if the Illumanti ever goes down we can get the cure for cancer from big Pharma bc I feel like we have one out there they just don't want to give it up bc they don't make as much money off of healthy people. So much suffering and lives lost bc of selfish people. It's such an evil world. I have lost loved ones to cancer. It's shocking how quickly it can devour someone. One second they're here and the next they're gone. 😢 Final 💭 you mentioned heaven, hell, Jesus etc. in several videos I've watched. I do pray that you know Christ. The line in this about not knowing where we go when we die, and then about IF there is a heaven. There IS a heaven and it sounds like you have explored your faith many times but haven't truly committed to accepting Christ. It sounds like God has been working on your heart. I pray that you find the truth you seek and accept Jesus as your savior. And soon bc time is running out. I know where I'm going when I die and I pray anyone reading this that doesn't know Christ comes to accept him soon bc once you do, death is not as scary. Prayer and faith makes so many trials in this life much more bearable. Especially with everything going down currently. I would not want to be here at this moment in time or in the future without God in my life. ❤️🙏  Thanks for the video. 😊
RIP my grandfather, he survived his first wave of cancer but his second made his heart to weak. Sadly died of a heart attack. Fight for your life
Here,  I get that you are doing a good thing, but you talk like it is all doctors faults that people die. No. They try their best. Respect them a bit more
Bro this song is for one of my good friends but it isnt him who had the cancer his dad died of stage 3 cancer
My mom is a skin and breast cancer survivor I love you tom your great brother
Call on the name of Jesus and ask for forgiveness. Trust in him. Only he can save you
Jesus loves u all so much
My grandmother literally died from breast cancer my great grandma fought and beat breast cancer 2 and was left with multiple scars
Love this song
When I was on my Natural cures they don’t want you to know about kick, I came across an article about Maple syrup and baking soda cancer cure. The doctor that came up with cure says that cancer is a fungus and baking soda kills fungus. Your suppose to starve the cancer by not eating sugars, because cancer feeds off sugar, and eat syrup and baking soda. It kills cancer and alkalines the body. Lots of info if you google it. Imagine if a .50 box of baking soda can cure cancer. No money to be made in that, so they wouldn’t promote it. If it works I don’t know, but could be worth a shot for someone that has cancer.
I can’t say anything but thank you. You are such an amazing man.
Awesome masterpiece💎👏🗣🎶

This dude is a wreaking ball of truth. Tommy M keep doing your thing.
My dad had cancer and I maybe have corna
<3
My mom had a brain anuerisim, 2 -12 hr surgeries and she survived only to have my dad die a week after she got out of the hospital! He found out he had cancer while she was in the hospital.  He chose to be by her side and make sure she was ok!  Never told anyone until.it was too late! At 45 he became my hero AGAIN!😢    Love the song Tom thanks!💙
This might be his best song yet
awesome production
Ive commented once on this...but i have to again just because as much as it hurts to hear this song its so true....and to EVERYONE WHO HAS LOST A BROTHER SISTER SON OR DAUGHTER OR MOM OR DAD OR THE ONE YOU LOVED AND SHARED LIFE WITH....if i had one wish...its not to be wealthy or has gold or jewels or anything like that....it would be the ability to heal ANY disease or sickness ANYONE had...no matter if u were black white brown pink yellow orange or gay or straight or ANY OF THAT....the ability to just take all the cancer and other stuff away....Because the pain u feel when u are holding the hand of who u love or that family member and u feel the life leave them..isnt something ANYONE needs to feel again or ever....god bless everyone...💕
Shut up 🤐
Just thought about my sister currently cancer sick🤦‍♂️, thanks for the message.
Amazing
Tom!!! You truly touched me with this one. I lost my bestfriend in the world to oral cancer. Watched him fight a wicked hard battle and he fought like a true champion. Ultimately cancer won but his memory lives on forever. You captured that fight perfectly on this track. Thank you!!!
We need a Propaganda video! Please
I never thought I would relate to a cancer song but here I am.
👏👏👏👏
Damn, laying here in the dark with tears coming down my face.   42 years old and a father of 2.   This song just brought me back to when I was 17 and watching cancer rip my mother away from our family.  Rip mom.
Tom macdonald thank you this is coming from a broken Man my wife pays all the bills I got two little kids and my diabetes gets worse and when I try to help myself I can't I just can't and all they want to do is give me shots and pills that kill me in the end they keep me alive for a little while but it's going to make my long while worse it's like having claustrophobia and you live in a trailer you have your ups and downs but nothing to calm you down tears flow like the river but nothing to stop the flow and lay down on your pillows but in the end it's like hitting bricks you think about going back to the drugs then you know they'll just cause more problems and you'll end up making more problems every time you think you get to that light it turns dark and there's nothing there 20 years of dark and it seems like it keeps getting darker every time I see a friend now it's like it's at a funeral I don't want the next funeral to be mine so I'm going to get better .
Amazing song and video. Great job @paige.westbrook. 🙏
Christ is life, death is gain. Give your heart to Jesus and no matter what happens in this life, you will spend eternity in the Lords glory!
There is a cure there has too be, big farma is the problem, we all know it. It's like big oil industry , if we all had 100 mpg cars ,they make no money. But yet ,look up the 100 mpg shell car , the 100 mpg carburator existed and so dos the 100 mi per gallon fuel injection system. They don't care about the people , (💰) great evil , I have what a father of mine at six foot tall 200 pounds drop down too eighty . And die on the hour he told me he would die. This father had many son. My real mother has had breast cancer and won the battlefield. With hope it will never come back.        American people awakening is hear know!
This song hit so hard in my heart
This song is amazing, my mom passed of lung cancer when I was 17, I'm 43 now and it still baffles me that they say there is no cure yet. Like what are they doing with all that money? But n e ways love the new song, just keep being you.
Nascent iodine SHILAJIT from a guy in facebook named Tris West or any other source works Activated charcoal - detox Chlorophyll - purifies blood Oil of oregano - potent anti viral Holy Basil - adaptogen, potent healer Avoid sugars and breads and processed food Quality meats are good High dose vitamin C 10+ grams a day Pure water Miracle 2000 multivitamin - AWESOME Pure Zeolite 10000 iu vitamin D every mornin for 2 months then go to 5000 iu Eat plenty of sea salt and get potassium and magnesium Lemons and limes Theres more that can be done, but i helped a lady with these things and saw her feel alot better after doing them. Her hair even changed back to having color again from being gray to black
Thanks for this just had me thinking of my son 5 years ago being diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma and having to get a femur transplant and seeing his dress crushed.  Now he's in college following his same dream just a different approach.
Honestly, I would get cancer if it meant someone else in this world didn't. Even if I don't know that person, I would take on cancer for the world if I could.
this remind me of my baby bro he died from cabcer i wish i can show him this but he died 7 years go edit: i mean ago not go
This is what should be winning #Grammys
Tom you the real one, everyone else making songs about wealth. You are one of the few addresing the real issues. Big love dawg

I had cancer just about five years ago went through surgery and chemotherapy and now I'm on my last year on a five year plan to see if it returns next year is supposed to be my last of blood work and ct scans this song touched my heart thank you for making this beautiful song and the art of this video
Man it’s so hard to lose the ones you love the most Cancer is pure evil, My grandmother and great grandparents would be here if Cancer would just stay away!!! ;(((( god why.!!!!!! ;(((((((((((((((((
What a real, genuine, meaningful song... it's all so true...reminds me of my best friend who died of cancer at 42 only 3 weeks after his diagnosis...RIP Joe Brundige 😭😭🌅
This song is AMAZING..  I have liked your other songs in the past.  This one will come flying up those trending charts.  Because it hits home with so many people.  Thank you so much for putting out a tremendous song like this.  I will personally make sure that you get lots and lots shares.
Thanks bro love this my mom died in 96 from brain cancer she was only 30. I've had several other family members die from different cancers and have known other people who have passed from it unfortunately. It's hard watching someone you love die slowly and there's nothing you can do too take the pain away or the sickness. I hope one day there will be a cure but I don't see it anytime soon. Big pharmacy drs and all make to much money on chemo meds and other crap.
Saturated fat and cholesterol... aka animal products... Call me a crazy vegan but its just the truth.
🙏🏽
I spent 2 months recovering in the hospital a couple of years back. It wasn't for cancer, but they had me in the oncology recovery ward, and I got to meet a lot of people who were survivors, and more than one who knew they weren't going to make it. One of those was only 19 years old, and I had to listen through the partition while her parents raged against the surgeon who couldn't do anything; their daughter was stage 4 colon cancer. What broke me was when the girl finally spoke to the doctor, and her words still haunt me to this day: "So I'm now just waiting to die."   19 years old...speaking in a way no one in her age should. Fuck cancer.
I lost my cat and my grandfather to cancer. This made me cry. Thank you Tom for making this song.
Dating someone who fights to this day....hell yea tom....you really are what people need to hear
Dude thank you for this my mom passed away the day after my bday from stage 4 lung cancer but it spreaded through out her body and it just got bad we thought she beat it or was beating it it was getting smaller but then bam but this means alot for me and everyone else that has it or knows someone and all those people just stay strong its hard but stay strong
Brother this song is amazing
<3
My mother passed away when i was two from cancer and my cousin got cancer and luckily survived praise the lord he is good please share the message of god cause what would this workd be without him 🌹
Love guy my mom died of cancer this song means alot
My great uncle lost his battle to cancer the day before you released this song. My grandma beat ovarian cancer. Praying it never comes back. I lost both grandfathers to cancer.
Yes i 😢
Thank you
Turn away, if you could get me a drink
Thank you
to whoever read this :  1 ) a lot of love from canada ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ =^w^=  2 ) Furries aren't bad we are one of one of the most loving and accepting community in the world and some people could take exemple on that ( if they do the world would be way better )
Made a navy vet cry! Thank you Tom!!!
You so called blacks hispanics and native Americans are the lost Israelites according to the bible and history, the world has lied to you. The laws are not done away with like the pastor's have told you. You must still keep all the commandments. Repentance isn't repenting and doing the same thing over and over. Christ died to give you a chance at grace, similar to a grace period for a bill. But remember that bill must still be paid. I advice anyone who wants to know the truth to watch hidden enemies 1-6 by cnycefilms144. I love you all.

a legend
Touching video my grandma passed away in February from cancer but it is a good song and also touching
Some of the rich and the Pharmaceutical company makes more off of you while you're sick and dying
thank you for this song Tom
My Grandmother lived through Breast Cancer twice!!! Had a double mastectomy, and just passed away from Diabetes a few months ago. It's indescribable how that feels. She was the toughest woman I had ever known
Finally someone with a brain
Oh lord
Thank you for speaking the truth
This made me feel so much for my Aunt Rhonda who fought against it for so long. This song moves and brings hearts together about something so serious. Thank you so much Tom and Nova for making this video. You will continue to be 2 people that will make me continue to fight and help those who need it. Keep doing your thing Tom, thank you and god bless!
I've seen it first hand with my aunt, and watch some of my friends families go through it. It's so ugly, scary, and to be told you only have to long to live at a young age or if your'e elderly. It still shocks you, just know #tommcdonald this is gonna help so many ppl in this world. Thank you for this track. Keep up the hard work, you've been an inspiration to me. Thank you again
Thank you Tom
Thank you my husband is fighting a rare form of brain cancer called Chordoma it's inoperable and incurable proton radiation was the only treatment for him to buy him more time and 3 yrs later he is still fighting 🙏
Just got news about my dad. They all live in Missouri, I’m out here in Washington. I have a deployment coming up soon. Didn’t meet him until I was 15 and found out the truth about why he wasn’t there for me. Wasn’t his choice but my mother’s. Last time I visited him I made a promise to move him up here with me. Idk why I’d do it I couldn’t keep that promise. I just want a life with my father.
My wife is a esophageal and stomach cancer  surviver we have 3 beautiful children together the bad part is she can't take kemo cause it will make the blood poison in her legs travel faster thank you for this song bro
Tom you going to release anymore of your spoken word stuff?
My mom died from bladder Cancer 😪
Jonie Bachle was her name she was 31 when she passed two years ago this coming JUne 2021  She was vibrant outgoing sassy mom of  four.  She had both breasts removed then it spread to her brain. Two weeks before she died I took her driving around   She talked about taking the kids to colorado she couldn't die because they had things to do.  Her baby is going to be  7 oct 24th . Annika is her name the mini me of her mom.  Today she  picked out a angel christmas ornament to paint  for her Mom.  Her two sisters Kiwi and Aubrey and Brother Landon  live with their adoptive Dad  he adopted them a couple months after she passed.   A blended family.   We miss her everyday.   Thank you for this song
💞
Nice job🙏💜🐶 you both
lmao trash hook and song
This song makes me cry, as a father I couldn’t imagine my daughter getting sick.
Wow this hit right in the feels🥺 i lost my grandad 2yrs ago after we found he had Leukemia and he passed not even 12hrs later. He was my rock, my life, my hero and Cancer took him from me
So many types of cancer is the damn reason , cancer also mutates , spreads to other organs . There is and never will be a one drug cures all cancer cure , just as there is no cure for the common cold .  You 100% won the lottery if you beat cancer , but still it don't mean it won't return
My first time hearing Tom new sub here!
My mom just lost her fight with cancer on the 9th and her wake was yesterday when this song came out this made my day I wish she made it a few more days to be able to hear this... thank you
My grandmother has had 7 types of cancer over the past 20 years.. she beat every single one!
OKAY now this is what a real artist does!!! Something that everyone can relate to no matter race, the evel of cancer and the ones who need to hear this, that they are not alone, the fight is real and we as people must be strong together! My Love to all the sick. Stay strong, Don't give up and may your beautiful heart keep beating on! YOU GOT THIS!!! ✌❤😊    ❤H.O.G.4LIFE!!!❤
Needs another Dax feature to spread more awareness of world issues. Loved the fake rappers song!
Cannabis cures most cancers.  Look up RSO for cancer treatment.  Peace and love you all
My dad beat leukemia, died of lymphoma 3 months later, a few months later my father in law died of large cell melanoma. Before he was diagnosed he had chest xrays, somehow they didnt see a 12mm mass behind his esaphagus...the entire medical industry is profiting on keeping people sick.
3 of my 4 grandparents died from cancer. I lost my first grandparent at the age of 10 I was young but 28 years later I remember it like yesterday.  I lost my dad 5 years ago to cancer he was only 55.  My dad was not a smoker or a drinker and lived a very normal life right up until his diagnosis. He fought it like a warrior and never gave up right until the end.  I’m afraid it will also be my destiny, I think about it more then I like to admit and it truly scares me as I have lots of cancer in my family. In my 38 years I’ve witnessed first hand 4 extremely close family members and dozens of friends and family acquaintances fight and lose their battle with cancer.
My mom died from cancer in 99 and i just foubd out my dad had cancer and got beat it
Right on Tom.
My dad has the worst cancer out here right now in had one of his orgens removed this song means a lot
Love this dude.
why is that the worst bald affect ever
This song is amazing ...I found out my mom had cancer after I watched a family friend die of brain cancer and it didn’t feel real till she started having seizures and as a kid I didn’t fully understand what to do during them she stopped breathing then started back thank god for our neighbor realizing something was not okay and came to help me bust cancer is a bitch and nothing prepares you for it
Man this song strikes a chord.  My mom had breast cancer, brain cancer and bone cancer.  All the doctors did was extend her life and I'm happy they did.  My mom finally died this May of cancer in her spinal fluid.  If they do have a cure and the pharmaceutical companies are holding it back then I hope they go to hell.  The worst part was that my mom lost the ability to walk and was bed ridden in a nursing by herself and family was not able to visit her because of the corona virus.  Cancer is in our genetics and I hope no one has to battle it.  It takes a toll physically and emotionally.  My only saving grace is that I hope to see my mom in heaven one day.
this song right here has got me in tears due to recent diagnosis this just became my favorite song for the rest of my long life  ...one love Tom McDonald
This was absolutely beautiful! I lost my aunt to cancer on September 11th. She was told on September 10th that she had 2 weeks to live and the next day she was sleeping and went. Thank you for making this because people need you and your words. ❤️
Beautiful song mate ..
Love this song but makes me cry,  lost my older brother a month before my baby brother turned 6 and my cousin the day before my graduation and the day after his wedding to cancer
Damn.  I survived stage 3 cancer.  Damn again.  This song and video have me in tears.  I'm a 40 year old man whose been in the military and incarcerated.   I've seen some shit.  But my scariest days were when I layed in that hospital bed not knowing if tomorrow would come.  This song made me think of those who passed away around me.  Man, you are talented and gifted.  Thank you for reminding me why I changed my life.  Fuck cancer.
I don't know. I guess because I'm not the kind of fan that eats out of your palm I don't see it more than a motivational speech. It's alright but not crying. Maybe I'm numb after having my own cancer scare after watching my dad die slowly and painfully. Yet he never failed to be our pillar at his hardest times. He was dying yet he was still our strength. It's like standing on a beach watching a tsunami coming. No where to run. Nowhere is safe. It's going to hit. It's going to fucking hurt. Then there's the limbo at the end. You know goodbye is here. You think you're ready, you wait. You go through all thos 7 steps of wtf ever they say it is you go through when experiencing loss. Then you get that call. Fuck. Everything changes. You hear a lot about God's plan. You learn to hate that and fuck God and his fucking plan. Fear. Anger. Inevitability. Loss. Empty. Sheer rage and pain. That is cancer. This song. It's a cute a tribute. Guess after the passion you put in your other songs I would have seen it in this but yea, it's a great motivational speech to "keep fighting, you got this". It's cute.
There is incredible power in music like this!  Keep on keeping on!  Love what you are doing
I followed your music since day 1
I believe there are real cures out there that can save lives without being destructive.  My mom had cancer 3 times over the course of 15 years. The surgeries, toxic chemicals and radiation may have kept her alive longer but it was at the expense of a reduced quality of life. The last cancer that finally killed her was caused by the radiation treatments for the previous one. I spent her last 3 weeks with her as she was dying in hospice. She left this world in peace. Thank you so much for sharing your heart and your talent; this was beautiful.
Good job on the lyrics from the  heart totally felt the lyrics
My Grandma just passed this January of Pancreatic Cancer... she had it for 3 years before it took her from me... We were very close. The last thing I ever said to her was that I loved her very much and I wasn't ready to loose her yet and she told me that even if I'm not ready that she was... That was the day before she passed... it's still hard to talk about. I have tears right now just writing this.. I spent every summer with her from kindergarten - Junior year of high school.. She was everything to me... it's been very hard without her..
I need help. Im a survivor
Sounds like macklemore song lol
The cure for cancer will be found the second this guy stops making music
Vitamin C (Gerson therapy)
How could anyone dislike this my heart goes out to all of you that are fighting to survive this  Disease
Lost my mom 2 lung cancer.  Feel these lyrics big time....
I don't know this dude. But I like him
Great job brother ...took me a couple of days to watch this ...almost a couple of days anyway...you did good man ...you need to sing more ...I love your rap ...but damn you can sing ...
Dude. Speechless. 💜
Ive carried 9 realitives ro the grave.  3 died to cancer.  The closest was my mother who died to cervical cancer that spread to kidneys and finally lungs at age 55.  She went through chemo and radiation.  The cure is much worse than the disease and when that cure isnt a cure...  Ive come to the conclusion that cancer is not a disease.  It is a limiter nature has put on life.  We do not live forever and to me there is no cure for your time being up.  Regardless I miss my mom, great uncle, and cousin.  Death is sad regardless of how it happens.
my cousin is only one year older then me and im only 20. I looked up to him as a kid and I thought he was the coolest... only 21 with cancer this video hit me hard
Because cancer is different in everyone. It’s ridiculous to suggest that we have the cure when everyone is different: what works for one does not work for everyone. Most of the money that’s donated is swallowed up by corporate and a small amount is begrudging given to scientists who actually do the research.
This is so tacky, crazy people think its good lol
God this is y I love u this song made me ball and I'm at work thank u for this very powerful song keep doing what u do hun
I know where i go when i die but, i don't  want to be murdered,  because  they deliberately  don't  make a cure. That is the same as murder....
I fucking love that you speak the truth. Keep doing what ur doing man.
I cant like this enough I am a two time childhood cancer  Survivor. Tom Macdonald Thank you. your the man
I lost my grandmother to cancer, the moment she was diagnosed she went through the treatment just to spend more time with us. I lost her at the age of 8 years old. I feel like I'm losing her again because I'm losing the memories. She fought hard to spend each holiday with us and I will always cherish what memories I have left of her.  Now I'm watching my father go through the same battle. Right before I was to get married my father went through a procedure to help bring down his levels. He was a stage four but by the grace of God he went down to a stage 1. He was able to dance with me during our song at my wedding. Unfortunately my father is still going through treatment even through this pandemic. I haven't given my Dad a hug since my birthday which was in February because his still going through treatment. I'm trying to stay strong but I just want to wrap my arms around him. My Dad is a fighter, and he will get through this. Thank you for creating this song <3 It speaks the truth and the feelings I couldn't put on paper.
This song is so good but really sad keep it up Tom! People who have it I hope you guys get through it.
I lost my grandmother and favorite uncle to cancer i myself had a cancer scare a few years ago thank God it was a false alarm
❤
I just ...... wow
Beautiful
Beautiful songs. Thank you for expressing ❤️
Cried till a couldn’t anymore. Hip hop needs more people like you
Facts 100% no cure yet .
I had cancer 5 years ago but what is fucked up my was a rare cancer but why is it not important because it wasn't breast or colon
Thank you for being you Tom....our would is a better place because of it. Never stop...
I lost my gram to it and my cousin my uncle survived it now my stepdad has it CANCER SUX!  I appreciate this song ty
Wow. Jaw on the floor, tears in my eyes. Thank you for this.
YOU are loved and in need of a savior , we are living in the last days . Please don’t turn away from God he is calling YOU. Deep down you know there is a higher power , a higher creator . John 3:16 , for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life . Repent of your sins , accept Christ as your savior . Believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that you have sinned , we have all sinned and fall short of the glory of God.  Believe that God sent his only son ( Jesus Christ ) to die on the cross for your sins, the price of our sins was paid in full  ! Accept his gift and you will have an eternity with him.
I lost my mom to blood cancer 10 years back since then my home isnt really a home i miss u ♡mom ♡rip♡
This had me in tears 😢. God give them strength and heal those who are suffering 🙏.  We don't know your plan but I hope we can find a cure soon.
Fucking love Tom McDonald. Stay real Tom ✊
I won’t give up my hero you blessed me ❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰
Why people dislike shit like this even if u dont like the guy still a good message
It happened to me too, I was young enough to take the treatments and bounce, keep positive.......we all die of something .......fight the bastard....
I have idiopathic intracranial hypertension which is a fake brain tumor and i couldn't imagine what a real tumor is like all i know is i wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy. Hugs for all those with it.
Always goosebumps with this man. I didn't wanna watch this because everyone has known someone fighting this. Thank you for this Tom!
As a survivor this hit home. I blasted metal everyday on the way to chemo, songs like "built to fall-trivium" "always-KSE" etc
Been through it. Uterus cancer. Haven’t been able to have kids because of it. I fought it but a mirena used for preventing pregnancy is what is keeping the cells from reforming. Removing means it will most likely return. I’d be a great mom better than so many moms out here. But I’ll never be able to experience that blessing. Everyone in my family dies from cancer. I know one day it’ll most likely be how I go to. But Fck why does it have to be. Fck cancer.
Beautiful song Tom
💔😢✌🏼
hey tom i just wanted to say keep spreading your meaningful and inspiring messages it rlly hit hard keep it up tom
Such a powerful song brother, straight goosebumps the whole song. Beautiful message bro 💯💯💯
Tom Macdonald - Do you actually care and are you trying to bring these things to light? Or are you just using a touchy subject to pull on peoples heart strings and rake in a profit? Im not accusing you, but I can't help but to wonder. If its the ladder then shame on you. If it was true then I'm sure you'd never admit it. I just don't like the idea of someone using the subject of cancer to earn a buck. Seems scummy to me, but its all speculation. I'm a fan of your music. I just can't shake these ideas. I'm not saying the song is bad or any negative thing like that. Its just the reasoning or motivation behind it (speculative) that bothers me. Of course you don't have to answer to me because I'm not God. But as a fan of your stuff I feel like I should throw in my two cents. ✌ and best wishes!
Wow now this is music
Lost my dad to Cancer when I was 11, my mom when in my 20's.... My brother is fighting throat cancer now.... Both my sister's that are still living have had/fighting one form of it .... I don't want to even know if I have it.....live day to day
Miss you Mom. I'll see you soon!
We are scientifically advanced enough to find the cure for cancer. The problem is people get paid when other people are dying. I wish someone would prove me wrong.
Tom you are a magnificent man I love you're music and keep  on blowing my mind track after track this one did make me tear up its beautiful you deserve more love once again love you're music
My mom died of cancer 3 weeks ago. It was the most horrible thing to watch.. she was only 51.
My grandma was like a 2nd mother to me, I had to watch her die from lung cancer when I was 13. I was with her a few months before when i met my dad for the first time and the month before when i got raped she was the person i went to.. Then when i was 20 i watched my dad die from kidney cancer.. Brest cancer runs in my family and I had a scare just last year. I have knots in my left Brest that i have to get checked every 6 months. I'm only 30 😢
Jesus christ man...the feels in this one got me hard. I'll admit I teared up. I have friends who are terminal. One of them is only 6 and doesn't have long left. Keep doing your thing.. you are one of the few artists who can inspire true emotion like that.
Dam Dam Dam i felt like you was speaking to me. Such an amazing song for any and all of us fighting cancer. Tom MacDonald music is one of my many forms of medication to fight every day to survive and stay strong, posotive as i now face what the medical world calls. End of Life we need more inspiration Thank you sir
I've lost so many friends and family to cancer I can't even tell you the number. My uncle was 2 years ago. They had a cure in Sweden but they wanted 250k up front with no promise. He was willing to pay it but the airline wouldn't let him fly. He died 2 weeks later.
This hitting hard telling the truth, need to wake up to messages in the song 👍
I watched my uncle get taken over by prostate cancer as a child. Physically seeing one of the strongest men I know fight the demons that were coming through the floor and smiling as the angels took control. 6 years ago my best friend fought and won her battle to non hodgkins lymphoma. The same year a classmate (32 in our graduating class) lost his fight to Sarcoma. 2 years ago I lost an aunt that I had just reconnected with a few years prior, to rectal cancer. She didn't tell anyone until she was close to her deathbed. She chose not to do chemo and fought as hard as she could but damnit I miss her. Oh man, lots of tears tonight. I'm tired of fucking losing people man. 😭
What beautiful lyrics!! You've out done yourself this time. Lol one of my favorites songs now. Thank you Tom!!
You did good tom thanks
This is powerful AF.
This hits home, my grandpa just passed away Monday from cancer
Lost my mom,grandma and grandpa to lung cancer,my aunt is a breat cancer survivor.. this song hits the heart!
This song hits so close to home.
I have lost both of my parents to Cancer. My mother passed away in 2001.. I watch the strong indepent woman who had already fought off breast cancer twice and skin cancer. Slowly waste away from bone cancer. She could no longer do chemotherapy as the cancer was actually feeding off the treatments. She was so drugged up that she didn't recognize any of her 5 kids. The last picture I have of her is with my daughter who was just over one year old. My Dad passed away from Leukemia in 2007. It was a rare for that produced blast cells like normal cancers. He did chemo for a year before it was correctly diagnosed. He was then sent to the local University hospital for specialized treatment. Before they could start and becuase it had already been a year..he started having issues with his kidneys.. He never started the treatment that could jave saved his life. He was brought home by ambulance. He was confused and restless.  The only bonus to leukemia is that it is not painful. He lasted 2 days and would ask for me non- stop. My brother and I stayed with my father on his lastnight of life. It is hard to this day talking to my father and letting him know it is ok that he go join mom. I held his hand and felt his pulse slow and stop. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about them and everything they did for me.
This broke me. Im in remission.
This is poetic and relatable.  Same questions we all have.
Stop making money off weak content
My mom lost my brother at 2 from brain cancer  before I was born but growing up not a day went by where she didn’t bring him up and how much she missed him still has all his clothes and shoes from then
Best song of 2020! This is the realest song I've ever heard written!! Some many thoughts!! 🔥🔥🔥
This has been on repeat since it dropped THANK YOU for this song it DOES keep me fighting
Everyone of your songs is soul touching in some way... Your a true artist
Sad song yet beautiful at the same time and something every family I know has gone through keep spitin the truth Tom I love every thing you do and I'm a 64 year-old man keep keeping. it real and another epic vedio  by Nova
My dad died of cancer when I was 12 yrs old. I didn’t even understand, but what I did understand, was the pain that I felt watching him grow weak, and when I realized he was gone... It transformed me as a kid, watching that. It didn’t make sense to me then. But I know there are others fighting cancer right now, just know I pray for you, while I don’t even know you. I pray you find peace, safety, comfort, healing. I pray you feel loved, the whole way through. If no ones told you today, I do love you, even if I don’t know you ❤️
I lost my grandma to breast cancer. At 24 I started having uterine issues. After I turned 25 I found out that I had mutated cells in my cervix that were precancerous and had to have a hysterectomy.... Thank God I had babies when I was young or I would have never had the chance to be a mom. I am chronically ill and have been since I have 10. I suffer from neurological and autoimmune conditions. The line that said money means nothing if we don't have our health hit home. I had to give up all my dreams so young. At one point I was bound to a walker and a wheelchair. My health has some what improved, but it's always changing. Thank you so much for your music! I used to take anxiety meds every day after listening to many of your songs I found comfort and realized I could do life without the anxiety meds. I take them now only when I really really need them. I have started to learn better ways to cope with my horrible anxiety!!! Thank you to you and Nova!!!
Love you tom  from Thailand
Yo, this is gonna help a lot of people  🙏
Miss my papa...hes right why so many have died? An its been yrs! Someone needs to confess the antidote
This really touched me. I lost my dad to cancer 9 years come January 2nd
There are no words to describe the way it feels when that doctor walks through those doors as your sitting next to the man (my Granddad) that has been my best friend since the day I was born and says.................... sorry damn I can barley type this shit. And says I’m sorry there’s nothing we can do but make you comfortable you have 3 to 6 months to live. To come to the realization not even 3 weeks later from that day my best friend is gone to heaven. Today would’ve been my Grandfather’s 79th birthday, this song means the world to me. Thank you Tom thank you so much!
This is truly magical, hip hop and storytelling with PASSION! The game is so lifeless now... He is an absolute breath of fresh air.
That was weird.
My auntie just got the all clear of breast cancer. This song is just whats needed.
How can anyone dislike this video??? 🤬
LET'S GO TRENDING TO SHOW WE HAVE HEARTS TO SHOW WE LOVE AND CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE CANCER CAN WE DO THIS H O G FOR REAL LETS GO TO NUMBER 1 CAUSE WE ARE  A HUMAN RACE 1 RACE AND SAME BLOOD... WHO EVER DONT PUT A DISLIKE CAN F OFF REAL.
I had a family friend who had watched me grow from the moment I was born to two years ago when he died of cancer. It was 18 months after his son died from an accidental overdose. He went from this.. Man full of life to a man who was terrified of dying. It doesn't just take away someone you love, it takes away a loved one. A best friend, an uncle, a mother.. A father, the list goes on.. I miss him every day and some times wake up, forgetting he is gone because it just doesn't feel right. I saw him take his last breath and that will forever be something I never forget.
I didn’t think this would make me cry but I was wrong. My son had brain cancer when he was 22 months old. He had 5 brain surgeries and a year of chemo and radiation. He had less than a 5% chance of survival . This week was 15 years since his diagnosis and he will be 17 in December. We celebrate that day as his “Special Day”. Instead of remembering the worst day of our lives, we celebrate his life. Your song brought me right back to that time and helped to remind me to slow down, to cherish every moment and to remember what is truly important. Thank you!  Life is a gift and a blessing.
Better than any of the meaningless party noise and drug glorification music put out by so-called "Rappers" like Lil Pump, Lil Xan, Tekashi 69 etc. This is genuine music.
My mom's had cancer for years and may get kemo soon
Damn bro this one hits deep. Awesome song bro
Cancer took my partner Sherri when I was 22 we were trying to have kids I remember when she first got diagnosed she had to physically sit me down and explain that she would not survive it I was dumbfounded angry and upset... after months of receiving chemotherapy in and out of hospital she would come and visit me in between one of the last time that I got to be with her we stood naked in the shower just hugging each other till the water went cold....god I miss her ..xox sherri
YOU are amazing fo using your platform to bring these messages to light! I love you for this! <3
YES!!!!!! Thank you so much for making this. I've lost two family members to cancer with another fighting 4th stage colon cancer.
This song is just...real... My docs  worker had it and I was so scared to loss her as she was my parent when my parents couldn't. She had to hide while all this crap has been going on this yr since she didn t have an immune system to fight off anything :( I think she has won but she keeps alot of it to her self ... I just hope she knows that if she ever left apart of me would leave with her as she is sent from God and the kindness person I ever got the chance to meet. She was all about us kids .
Amazing song hit heard, we lost my father n law 4 yrs ago to breast cancer and come to find out it was due to Agent Orange in the Vietnam war he was in, it ended up spreading to his brain and the rest of his body. Thank you for your amazing work you do.
This hit so close to home 😭 My dad lost his fight to leukemia when I was 14 years old. Back then I was too young to be tested as a bone marrow match (20 years ago), but now I signed up to be put on a donor list through Be A Match so hopefully I will be able to save someone else's life 🙏
Love the fact you are supportive, and your message reaches to everyone in one way or another. Mad respect for you Tom....I lost my dad in 2014 to Pancreatic Cancer and my world has fallen apart since then, but I am fighting to stay afloat, and have done much better in the last 6 years than I ever have.
It's SO meaningful, I love all the emotion this man puts in every record
Tom...  Where was this song 6 months ago when I needed it?
Thank you this is great
Its justs sad
My sweet papa passed away after a long 5 year battle with stage 4 cancer. I absolutely agree that there’s a cure for cancer. Cancer is too big of a money making business to put a cure out. Sad but true. My thoughts are with everyone who’s going through this. You are NOT alone. ❤️
it's crazy I'll watch my grandfather died of pancreatic cancer and I should kill them with them f****** like 3 months and suck because he literally didn't  smoke and doing that s*** like that it's weird cuz he worked out every single day and was sad to watch him pass away so fast
This is a great song
My mom and sister my heartbreaks for them I dont kno what to do
The strongest person I know is my brother who is currently fighting metastatic brain cancer. I shared this song with him while he's currently in the hospital and he asked for me to pass on that everyone must fight the good fight. Thank you so much for this song.
Absolutely amazing Tom!
My mother and great grandma both had cancer and this just hit home and made me cry. 😭 but youre an amazing artist 💜💯
This is doing to #1 on the charts!!  Maybe it might be at 8 right now!! But its on it way to #1 given the content!
This song is touching my daughter who is 5 is currently battling Leukemia this song is an awesome message
3 of my aunts had cancer and died this song actually hit me It makes me scared that I might get cancer
This Sucks... not the song the cancer
My dad has brain and liver cancer they just found it and said two weeks so yah needed to hear this song thank you
Stunned. Speechless.
Every song you make is awesome . hope to meet you some day
Your music has powerful messages and thats what has made me your biggest fan. Never change 💚
Rip EVH and EVERYONE who has ben thru this either personal or someone you know like tom says U R strong
GOD BLESS ALL OUR PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEGUN AND ENDED THEIR FIGHT VALIANTLY AND LET US FIGHT WITH THEM SO WHEN THEY BEGIN TO FALTER, WE CAN CARRY THEM TO THE FINISH... i love you dad everyday all the time forever, I’ll never forget how you won your fight and entered the KINGDOM of Promise..REST IN PARADISE.... your son, who adores you forever... iz.
I can't hate on someone in bringing good intentions, respect Mr.Mcdonald
Lost my pepaw to this hit hard
Thank God for Tom Macdonald🙏💯 this song could strengthen and lighten those diagnosed! #you'reafighter #dontgiveup
Damn son this hit hard
Nothing short of amazing!!!!!!💯💯💯💯❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thier is a cure but only for the extremely rich and powerful people.. You ever wonder why you never hear of any of the 1 percenters dying of cancer? 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🙏🙏🙏🙏🤗
Fuck cancer this song is so meaningful. Your such an amazing artists! Thank you for you and Nova's hard work!
honestly this song is complete ass. the instrumental, chorus, and writing is so awfully corny.
The music video was really good!!!!
This music video really touched my heart.  I was diagnosed with cancer at 21 about 5 years ago.  Lost all my hair and felt ugly whilst staying hopeful and strong for my parents. Now im a cancer survivor pursuing a career in oncology to help others fight this disease.  I send my prayers and hugs to anyone who is struggling right now.  And I thank this artist so much for making this video.  Need more music like this nowadays 💛💛 f*** cancer.
Truth , Cancer is caused by the system called the government UN  -politicians corporations, Big Pharma, HeathCare, are all poisoning your air, food, water, medicine, & everything you come into contact with since birth . Then they want to treat you while sick in their death camp Healthcare systems that kill everyone via more Posion treatments for the cancer they caused and other sicknesses they will only make worse! We all have lost to many people to continue on doing the same old bullshit and expecting a different outcome letting these overloads continue to kill our people! Plant medicine is key to your survival and Big Pharma is never going to tell you that! They are going to push their Posion Agenda on your family and friends until their is none of us left vaccinations radiation & cancer, you and your children are next in line, unless you make a stand! Don’t let your loved ones die in Vein stand up and Fight for our Earth and humanity’s rights. Break the system of Posion ! #romeisthedevil2020
Buying likes Tom Jeez this so generic garbage collection
The cure for cancer.   If you have it or know some who has share this with them.  https://www.mycancerstory.rocks/single-post/2016/08/22/Shake-up-your-life-how-to-change-your-own-perspective
Literally how could anyone dislike this?!
Jefferson Silas Mays, Sr. (Dad) ❤ April 3, 1971-June 20, 1994 💔
This ❤️ my daughter is 14 and has a genetic disease called Familial Adenomatous Polyposis... In June at her yearly endoscopy and colonoscopy her biopsy on a few polyps came back as precancerous.. She goes again in December and will be more than likely having an ileal pouch anal anastomasis or J-Pouch surgery... Cancer is the absolute worst thing anyone can battle... I had to pull her from school after an incident with her disease she was bullied relentlessly by other students... she still gets messages on different platforms from these lids and even kids in other schools...
Cancer took my mom.  She was healthy, never sick, took no precriptions, had a bump come up on her hip which made it uncomfortable to sleep.  Diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer.  She was gone in 8 months.  I took care of her.  She died the day after mother's day.  This year, I will be 55.  The age she was when she passed.
7 1/2 year Breast Cancer survivor. Its crushing to hear the words "You Have Cancer." 4 Months of Chemo & 36 radiation treatments and still worry to this day it will come back. I've always said there is a cure they just refuse to put it out there because of the money treatment brings the big pharmas. Love your music always speaks the truth!!
My mum had cancer and beat it, but i never forgot hot dark the times were and how depressed i still am over that shit! Thank you for making dope beats Dont Stop!
Beautiful 😢💔😢😢😢😢😢
This song just gave me cancer. ☠️
My uncle had stage 4 leukemia passed away 5 yrs ago
The people who disliked this are those who make money off of cancer.
Cancer is way too profitable for big pharma to "find" a cure, or even suggest a potential one. The people orchestrating this scam are the people you'll wish an eternal Hell for. They know exactly what cures cancer...  There are communities online curing themselves of cancer, and they're constantly being restricted or shut down. Full Extract Cannabis Oil. Fenbendazole. Raw Vegan. Repurposed drugs to block cancer fuel pathways. Look into Rick Simpson, Joe Tippens, Chris Wark, Jane McLelland... many have followed their protocols with success and have cured stage 4 cancers. Most oncologists are not allowed to even suggest alternatives. Once they've made their profit off of their chemo, they'll tell you there's no other option and leave your broken body to die, treating you symptomatically only. Extremely evil system.   Anyone reading this, I urge you to get familiar with the above mentioned protocols and people (there's even more). Because cancer will most likely hit close to home one day, and you don't want to be uninformed, and fall into this conventional trap. My father unfortunately did, and I had to learn the hard way. Sometimes chemo can help if you're in a really late stage, but it's temporary and should only be used to buy time while you work protocols that can actually cure it.
I felt that homie.
This truly affects me on a very personal level, I lost someone very dear to me from cancer, but thank whoever you believe in that I got to watch my mom kick it's ass, so thank you man, please keep dropping that knowledge!!!!
i thoroughly believe there is a cure for cancer, but the government make so much money from it that it’d be stupid of them to give it out (financially stupid). my nan died of cancer back in 2016. fuck cancer, but fuck the government
Love you!!
What sort of monster would dislike this? Good work again tom keep it up
Great video Tom. Thank you.
*We Need More People Like This*
Tom, this is one of your best videos yet. You and your crew really brought it hard with this one, the lyrics hit hard and the arrangement  is hella tight. I've been through the ride in the cement mixer that is cancer treatment - no one expected me to be here still but me. All anyone really wants for their birthday is another one.  Fight the good fight.
Tom Macdonald you have been blessed beyond anything I love your music and everything you stand for you have helped me so much
If I get cancer; I hope my doctor isn’t black
i was pro cancer until i saw this video, down with cancer!
Tom Mac is a fucking rockstar. For some reason I tried to not like this guy at first. I don't know why.  But he is seriously an artist. I love him lol
I literally just said this the other day, humans are dumb enough to buy their own cancer. Smh. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Wow bro... wow 😯
How can 2,000 people dislike this video. Sick people out there
Your so true to yourself it blows my mind.
How does this song have 2000 dislikes
True legend I lost my mom with stage 4 lung cancer in 2010 she was diagnosed on July 31st she died August 31st a month later , cancer is no joke I pray for all that have it .
I’ve lost a mentor and a friend to liver cancer he hid it for so long and when I started noticing come to find out he had been putting off going to a doctor because he didn’t want to fight the cancer or go through the treatment. Found out my cousin may possibly not make it neither or at best he’ll lost an arm from some type of cancer... I almost didn’t click on this song and this song just brought me to tears. Great song mate, great song.
🔥 shit bro...love all your music so far, but this is a fantastic twist. Keep rockin dude
Nice job 👍
Sad
thank God  someone is singing about meaningful stuff  AND NOT ABOUT A WET CAT .  🐈🚿🐈🚿🐈🚿🇦🇺
I have no idea why but YouTube keeps unsubing me from you, church and many others n it’s starting to piss me off! This will be the fifth time I had to look you up because not in my sub page and seen that not subbed anymore, talk about shadow bann to the next level!
You know my mom is going through stage four cancer and I can definitely relate since she went through it twice already
JESUS IS COMING  & HE LOVES  YOU  Believe the Gospel and Repent ⬇️⬇️⬇️  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 | KJV  REPENT: feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's sin   THIS WORLD IS FULL OF SIN JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY !!! JESUS is COMING BELIEVE AND AND ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR TRUST IN HIM TODAY GOD LOVES YOU SO MUCH JUST COME BACK HOME AND LOVE HIM BACK  DENY YOURSELF DAILY AND TURN FROM SIN DAILY
My mom has a type of Leukemia. Not sure which kind but if she would not have been the widow of a Vietnam Veteran who died from an Agent Orange related cancer himself...she would not have been able to afford the medication she currently takes - so thank GOD for the VA. The price would have been about $10,00 a month without a co-pay. That is far beyond ridiculous. Big Pharma can suck it! Thanks for thinking of those who are suffering and who have suffered - their families still feel the pain of the loss of those who are gone.
This touches home for me, my youngest daughter had to fight, when she was only a year and a half old we found out she had stage 4 cancer. Thank God she survived and has been cancer free for 6 and a half years now.
🔥🔥🔥
You're an amazing person❤👏💪
rest in peace uncle Joseph fox 🦊💚💚💚
Black ink tattoos are carcinogenic. The irony.
Dam the US healthcare system really fricking sucks doesn't it?
My dad died of pancreatic cancer back in March 4 days after my birthday. He was in the military and the govt tested shots and medications on dessert storm veterans. He also got uranium exposure and extra anthrax shots that affected his heart and all his organs. What a way to thank veterans for their service huh
I love you
This Truley made me CRY...My Bestie has breast cancer...and i wanted to cut my long black hair off to support her...2 other of my friends didnt make it..and my Grampa had testis CANCER...SUX
Dude your as real as they come but I’m sure you know this by now . Thanks Tom we need you to say things to wake us up
This is so good so true hurt when we lose our own loved ones  It’s so hard  Wonder if one we don’t have to die
Funny I was just talking about this the other day. Is more profitable to treat then to cure.
My Nan passed away from a brain tumour and when celebrating her life my grander fell and broke his spine the doctors said he would never be able to work eat drink by himself again so he told the doctors just to pull the life support
Thank you for exposing the business that cancer is. The treatment itself isn’t “healing”. You are scared and desperate, so you defer to what “doctors” suggest which have been indoctrinated to monetize your diagnosis. There are alternatives. Change the mindset. Change the healing process.
Thank you for this song. . My mom was just diagnosed on 9/23/2020. You probably won't ever read this just wanted to say a simple thanks.
@Tom keep telling the sleeping 💤 people about the truth bro - my favorite is “Clone” this song hits home I lost my dad July 2019 because of C.O.P.D from cancer , keep them knowledgeable hits coming 💯💯💯💯
First time ive heard ur work i became a big fan♥️🤘🏻ur awsome bro leep the hard work stay diffrint
Lost my husband September 30th..💔
your the man bro this is a great song
I hope your fine with this Tom, but MC2 which is a twitch team i'm part of wants to use this as the main song of our Breast cancer charity streams we are doing. This song is honestly an masterpiece that describes everything involving cancer perfectly. Theres no better song for the cause than this.
It's almost a year exactly since I lost my grandpa to cancer. He fought it for four years, and when he was turned down for treatments, he signed up for trials. He decided that if he was going to lose his fight, then maybe he could at least help someone else win theirs. When he found out it was the end, he looked at my grandma and apologized for having to leave her. I can't believe how unselfish he was, because even a year later I just want my grandpa/friend back. Like Tom said, I pray there's something after this so I can see him again.
Hoy just touched a whole new fan bar.  Nice tribute.
You are a Legend!!!! Your music hits the soul everything I listen to it !! You are a inspiration! Thank you for what you do !!!! Keep it up !
Opening starts with CANCER TOM MACDONALD in the title , I thought he gonna rap how cancerous his artistry is. Sorta like I'm Corny Pt.2 , but it turned out to be this wannabe compassionate song about a disease.... Can't wait for his take on tuberculosis or interstitial cystitis.
Aside from the obvious great lyricism and song concept, musically — this hook is fire! The vocal doubling and raw raspy singing at the top of his range is perfect at conveying the tone of this song. Also I love how it has an indie-folk flow.
Just Keep ur Head up
Gg
One question.   Why did you do that to your face?
Lost my last grandmother to cancer and now my dad has it. Never really had much to do with him but that doesn't stop me from praying nightly as I lay in my bed.
❤️
2k dislikes?? Pathetic souls
I've never had cancer nor known anybody close to me with it, but for some reason this made me wanna cry
My grandmother survived breast cancer twice and she is the most absolutely amazing woman. Shes never raised her voice,never got mad at  me she always knew what to say.
When I heard the first bit I figured it was just a conspiracy video
I have lost several people in my family to cancer, my mom included, this really touches deep, whoever thumbs down this video has no air for good music or didn't even listen to his message, thank you very much Tom
AMEN
Thank you Tom. From my mom.
This track has hit so many people hard.......
My dad passed away this June  Due to cancer   I miss him so much  We are so alone now He won't ever see me getting graduate Or getting married Or my kids  I hate this disease
If you disliked this video then be ready to square up.
*#13 on trending?* Bs!!! This should be atleast #3 or #1
Damn...        So deep ,.  So deep there should be another 3min of silence after song to let the quiet stew on the words he just said.       Wow brother.    Wow....
Cancer is cancer.
is that page
Holy shit, this hit home so hard. I lost my father, grandfather, and best friend to cancer within 3 years of each other. Fuck cancer!
Well I never comment on anything. But this time I am going to share my story. I survived pancreatic cancer.😌   but that not what hurt me the most. What hurt the most was my wife left me. She didn't want a sick man for a husband. My family took everything I had. I lost my house,  Everything. Because I got sick.  That's what hurt me the most. I just want to be happy again. I love u tom. Go for your dreams. U have a very special group of people behind u now. I hope u feel the love.
It makes me cry ive lost plenty freinds and family to cancer
U the man tom
Dam man rip james bagley I miss u so much brother keep watching over us f*** cancer 😢😢
thank you both my mum and had this fucking shit dad dead mum won but thank you Tom
Lost my grandpa to cancer and this song broke me up into a thousand little pieces 😔
All I could say is damn
Thank you Tom my mum and my best mate has cancer. I've already lost a few good people to it also cancer doesn't just effect the people who have it
The reason why we can't find a cure for cancer because there's over 200 different form of cancer that has to be researched and find a cure for, so a one-shot cure very unlikely!!!! Cancer also involves to create new form of disease which makes it harder for medicine to combat against it and for our immune system to slow or defeat it. They researcher are trying their best but if cancer going to keep involving that is going to take a longer time to find a cure or make new ones.
I was not ready
WOW, what an amazing song. The lyrics  gave me goosebumps and made me teary.  FU*K CANCER, enough said...💯💯💯💯  Gracias/Thank You Tom😞❤
Straight I  the feels man
Been killin it recently. Keep it going.
Yup. This one hits home.
Research food that prevents the spread of micro tumors and modification of the diet to reduce acidic content in your bodies ph is the key. I am a Chef de Cuisine and have spent years studying this.
I’m a woman in my early 60s and I’m really glad that my 34-year-old daughter turned me onto Tom MacDonald! I absolutely love the lyrics to every one of his songs, I’m a big fan Tom! Love from Toronto Canada! ❤️👍🏼🇨🇦✌🏼        BTW my mother died from lung cancer on Christmas day in 2006 at the age of 89 and she didn’t even smoke cigarettes. 😔
Your naaman always making songs out of reality. Brilliant mind
Man thank you for all you do and being so real people needs to take lessons brother keep it real and keep it up man you kill it in ever song.
There are many cures to cancer. Here is one of them https://phoenixtears.ca/
so meaningful. just listen to the lyrics
Dr Royal Rife cured cancer in the 1930’s
Very impressed with Tom Macdonald.  1st time listening to him but definitely not the last.   My Mom survived Breast Cancer a few years ago and it was a very aggressive version.  I was her caregiver and it does affect the whole family.
🤧
They do not want to cure. There's too much money in it.
Thank you
1.9K 👎and it hasn't been 2 days???? You must have some twisted deamons out there yall!!! There isn't a thing that Tom ain't trying to put his heart out there on and wants everybody to live there best life!! All the time!!! He speaks so real, and it's pathetic! This man is the realest dude Your gonna find that's out in front of so many. Still remains humble and focused on showing folks what they can't see. Making folks Woke Daily! Thanks for the music Tom!!!
Just saw this as an ad. This is WOW! Powerful! Great message!
Tom you did a thing on this one
Legend..... Keep speaking the truth! I love your music man, you are the best. ❤️
I don't have much to say but THANK YOU TOM MACDONALD !!!!
Wow this is bad
Jus Yotube... Dr T Colin Campbell..... meat and dairy CAUSE cancer...   must watch doc. Forks Over Knives, What the Health, Earthlings!.....
Also. Does every song have to sound the exact same
💯
My mom just got diagnosed with brain cancer. This song really touched me. Thank you Tom. So true
Thank you ☺️ can make a song about how turkey tail mushrooms heal cancer
This song doesn't mean much coming from an anti-vaxxer
Man Tom killed it again
Keep up the great work!
I spent yesterday praying for a sign, my grandma had a biopsy. It takes a toll to read on all the pain and the poison that it takes if it comes back wrong, I was still numb, and of all the days this could've dropped it. dropped. Friday. All I can say is thanks
I have Lukemea (blood cancer)  on chemotherapy now and it's really tough.  Trying to do a you tube channel too but it's hard being sick and weak alot. Oh also I'm an Iraq war Army veteran.  I just wanna make people smile in this rough world.   Thanks for listening guys!!!!!
well done sir
Well, I did cry like a baby, just like he said.
My grandma died from cancer and I had cancer and beat it this song is so true and hits home thank you tom macdonald
🙏🙏🙏🙏
This really hit me hard bec I had breast cancer I'm a Survivor. It's really hard but like he said you got to fight an have faith. I love this song so much..
This song hit home Tom, my niece got diagnosed with brain cancer when she was 9 she beat cancer but passed away from them doing a test to see if she had cancer again an it cause her to have a stroke. She was such a strong an smart girl will be 2 years in December an I miss her everyday
My mom passed away n 2005 I had to set in the room while a room full of people or fighting for their lives and at 15 that was a trip my mom in and out of the hospitals not knowing if she’s not going to come back home to us.  I had to drop out of school and tried to go back the following year and the board of education told me that I was a waste of there time but that white privileged helped out right beens we just get everything handed to us my sister passed away 2 years before my mom and so I lost my 2 best friends in 2 years now I am alone with no 1 but my girlfriend and 2 kids. You what’s funny though my mom sent me a sign after she passed away I wished backed then that my 1st child was born around her birthday and it happened on the 9th of March my son was born my moms B-day is the 10th of March so she answered 1 of my prayers. The week my mom got real bad I was setting on the front porch and was talking to my sister in heaven and I just keep asking my sis is there some place mom will go and she will be ok. The year my sister passed away she lost a child in January well as I am setting there I decide to look up at the clouds and it was a bright sunny day with a lot of big white clouds and this 1 cloud was in the shap of a angel with a horn and there was a little child in front of the angel with a horn to the wings was beautiful it was truly amazing and I just keep wishing I had a camera to get the Photo of it because it was clear as day what that cloud was it might have been just my mind playing tricks on me but it really did look like 2 angels. Thanks Tom for this u did a great job I wish this song was around back then. All these rappers talking about the chicks they banged or the hood they grew up in we done heard al that bring some real shit to the table.
Even though this doesn't pertain to my problem, still this helped me today. My metal disorders were winning the battle, thank you for giving me the upper hand today.
Still haven’t been killed for the truth
I know 3 who died of lung cancer, 2 Fam 1 good friend, Lost my mom one week before I turned 18, Was all I had, Woke up one day and realized all I loved was gone, That was 32 years ago and it still fcks with my head, Had a old friend call me and I stood right beside him as others ran off, Last one was a cousin I called my brother, That one broke me badly for awhile, Hard to put on a poker face when you watch someone you love become a shell of themselves, Even worse is when it all goes bad, You might even sit there and say please God end this, Your torn inside, wanting them to stay, But want the suffering to end,,,, Last man standing sucks, Your stuck with your thoughts because you must maintain your poker face in public while something you see or remember rips the scab off.
Amazing song Tom. My mom was recently diagnosed... lucky early stages and beat it! Thoughts to all currently in the fight!
Wow !!! Just wow ! Take a bow Tom Macdonald , you deserve the upmost respect for this 1 brother 🙏🏻
This song really hits hard man... My fiance had a sarcoma in her liver when she got pregnant and she wanted to keep our son when it spread to her lung. She lost her fight a little less than a month after he was born. Not a day goes by I don't see her when I look at him.
Absolutely loved this very beautiful song man, yet again another good one
This song is the definition of r/iam14andthisisdeep
Tom,  You just made my wife and I cry. Three years ago my wife was diagnosed with stage 3 triple negative breast cancer. It took two and a half years of hospitals crying for months at a time and begging God to make the night mare end did she hit remission. But since she is triple negative that means no matter what she won’t live longer than five years. We have four girls at home 7, 13, 15, 16 I have no idea how I’m going to survive  without my soulmate. I hope this song brings more awareness to cancer. We have maybe 2-4 years left and so we are doing everything we can to make the best of life. But my wife can’t work and I lost my job cause we had no one to take her to treatment so I had to and they let me go. Anyways my family loves your music and please keep making good music!!!!  God bless you! Marcus M.
Big fan of how you say what you feel, last few tracks were honest truths and this too. Beautiful workmanship tom.. 👍 Breath of fresh air.
I love this man
I love this man
I love this man
Wow powerful song hits the heart so true
I was diagnosed with cancer when I was 7 so this rlly means a lot 🤍🌻🎗
Been there done that. I was a lucky one cancer is evil.
Good message. But I can’t stand this guy
I can't dislike song. As different as this is I watched all the way thru. I like this song
😖😖
My son was diagnosed at 5yrs old with a brain tumor and I have had countless night’s laying next to him in an icu bed crying silently.wow this video hits home. I can’t quit crying.after 39 surgeries and countless treatments he is 17 now and no tumor.He is my fighter,and my hero.Tom thank you for telling the story so many of us silently suffer through.So much love 💕 🙏
😢💔
Man thank you Mr tom ... Love you bro
Lost my grandfather back in 2016. We were very close but i was working abroad. The day i went back home i went to visit him. He died 2 hours later.
Tom,  Wow. We have listened you for a while. My mom has Cancer and this song is absolutely needed. You are i believe one of the best writers of all time! Keep doing what you are doing, I am glad you came out of your dark times to help so many see the light. PS: if ya ever need anything aviation related, let us know. Keep up the good fight.
This song reminds me my gramma she die from skin cancer
Tom I haven't heard a bad song from you!! You are a legend! Did anyone else notice the clock on the wall was set at 4:20?
The government is definitely  hiding the cure
I felt that one! Rip to all the people who have passed due to cancer. 👼🙏💔❤️ There are sooooooo many!!! And you're right Tom, where is the cure? I hate to say it but we live in a very evil corrupt world. Far more messed up than most people think it is I believe. Keep dropping your music bro. You have a unique original type of style and that's cool!! 🙏👼
Hi, if you are battling cancer right now, you are amazing, you are loved, you are strong, you are courageous, you are a light to the rest of us. I'm sorry you're going through this, but just know the entire world is rooting for you right now, don't give up you are an amazing fighter and you will see this through.  P.s. I love you, don't EVER give up.
A cancer making a song about cancer lol
My grandpa died from cancer he was strong and funny and next he was so weak 😭
My great grampa fort cancer 2 and the therd time passed bless eny soal that whent through what hundreds of people go through a year
Speaking so much truth brother!! Tears for sure
Good message but this corny asl
🔥🔥🥺❤️
This hit home my uncle is getting a biopsy Tuesday
My mom died from skin cancer the day before my 19th birthday. She stopped treatment bc it was making her so sick and she didn't want to live her last months like that. Now my step mom has stage 4 rectal cancer. I hate big pharma bc of it. There has to be a cure out there.
I love this song, my mother is a cancer survivor and she's the warrior who inspired me, thanks mom ♥️
Amen Stay Blessed turn words.
Such a great industry plant
Love it ! My mom's fighting lung cancer . The same cancer took her mother . Everyone who's had cancer or is fighting it my heart goes out to you !
Lost my Father, aunt, and several others to it. Thank you Tom for putting into lyrics the pain of going thru being in the hospital room wanting to knock the doctors head off because he said there was no hope all smug like he had all the answers. Pops only lasted a year fron diagnosis to death. What's in your heart makes you that legendary rapper. #TomMacdonaldisthebestrapperalive!!
Hits to close to home.  I've lost most of my family on my moms side from cancer. I lost my maw @14. I've laid to rest 6 aunts/uncles to Cancer. My little brother has been fighting since he was 19. Found out day after Christmas. By the grace of God he is in remission. He is now 25. F*ck Cancer!!
I can't tell if that girl's face is peeling because makeup was on break between shots, or if it's just the cancer.
Hurts 😕 My grandpa is 70 years old. This March my grandfather started felling TERIBLE pain on his hip and couldn’t walk. One day he got up and went to use the bathroom. He fell. He calcium was very high. We called the hostbital to come and him. They said it was just a cold so we went a diff hospital the next day. On June 1st he got diagnosed with kidney cancer. Stage 4!!! He is still fighting and will get better soon!🙁
KEEP IT GOING ‼️‼️‼️💯💯💯💯💯💯♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Well he says we don't know where we go. Well if your a Christian then you will go to heaven. If your not then you go to hell. It's that simple.
These words mean more than I can ever express. For the last 4 years I have been caring for my son who was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer. He was in the Army when he was diagnosed. Everyday is a battle.... It's one he will continue fighting and not give up...no matter the prognosis. I see his fight in your words...
You and NF need to release a song together.
Cancer sucks ass!! I’ve lost to many family and friends to that illness. This hits home hard 😢
Blink 182 called, they want their hook back
Wow that is very deep.. Yes I am crying 😢 Beautifully done your mixing truth, hope, pain & questioning the afterlife..   You have just  planted a beautiful seed Tom ❤
I’m crying 😭 as a Survivor 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I have cancer, been fighting it for over 9 years.  Many treatments and still being treated.  This hits home and I thank you Tom!
Amazingly well made song. Great message and is inspiration to all that that hear it I'm sure. Everyone knows or has known some going through the fight and even those who have lost someone to the fight. Thanks
To the 1.9k people who disliked this video What Is Wrong With You?
Tom! Question! Would it be cool if I used some of your music on my youtube channel? Offroading and small building/fixing projects
I swear I fucking hate cancer I lost my brother last year to it he never even looked weak I always thought he was indestructible after wrecking 4 wheelers at high speeds and even getting stabbed in the abdomen he was always fine and tough and when he got cancer I knew he would be fine that he could beat it but 2 weeks after taking the red devil kemo his heart gave out moments after I got to him it I just wish things had turned out differently and that he was still here fighting it and I hope this song helps anyone else that’s fighting it
I feel like this song deserves more views! Great song tom! Thankfully don’t know anyone with cancer (hope that doesn’t mean it’s me 🤷‍♂️) can only wait till I’m 50 for the free nhs health checks 😂 think this song will touch and help a lot of people thought!
Amazing 💜
My grandpa just died of leukemia this year, this shit is sad asf.
When the big C took my mum in 2005....She left me a letter that finished...’love your greatest fan, MUM - Son I will be waiting for you at the gates’ still makes me cry today ....miss you mum x great song
I dress up like Spider-Man for kids birthday parties and I go to the hospitals too. I wanna spend time with those who needs encouragement and never give up stay positive and stay fighting
Man this song hits home for all of us who have lost someone to cancer.
💓
China already found a cure to cancer
Everytime you watch this does it count as a view? Or if you watch over like 20 times does it only count as one view. Always wondered that
Year 5 (since diagnosis)and 2 surgeries , im finally in remission, but you always have the fear, when will it come back and if it does how much worse will it be... Its a fight to stay positive and not let fear take over.
My father was diagnosed with cancer a year ago. He's been cancer free for the last few months. They went in and cut out the cancerous tumors.
My cousin just passed this year from it ,thanks Tom ❤️
Cancer sucks and so do the people that profit from the pain cancer brings to families.
Tom is beyond awesomistic for singing the truth 💯 Most singer's just give us a spoon of sugar (song) to help the meds (money) go down (Their pockets)
I cried! Damn man! I have all 5 of your cds herd every song 30 times. But the vid and song together hit so damn hard. Been telling everyone about you for 6+ months. You are a legend already!!
Tom keep speaking on shit everybody else scared to talk about💯🔥 my mom beat breast cancer faught for 4 years! She ended up passing away from liver and kidney failure at the age of 42 back in 2012
Nobody, nobody, nobody makes songs like Tom. This guy has the best topics, and sticks to it in every line of the song, it all is so meaningful and satisfying, thanks Tom, #hangovergangforlife
You did it again Tom 👏
Tom i listen to alot of your songs but i think this one is very inspiring and i hope ot gets out there and it hits #1 man. I love what you have put out there in the world continue What your doing your  doing 👌 awesome. I lost an aunt about 2 years ago and it effected my family extremely especially during the holidays when we all gather together miss her dearly and punish my self for not being able to go to her memorial. Keep up the good work Tom love your music
DUDE I AM A 46 YEARS OLD WHITE DUDE THAT IS A STONER ROCK / METAL GUY....I CANNOT EXPLAIN TO YOU ENOUGH HOW MUCH I LOVE YOUR STUFF!!!!   I DONT LISTEN TO ALOT OF RAP BUT YOU GO SO MUCH FURTHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL BOUNDARIES OF RAP.  I WISH YOU NOTHING BUT SUCCESS!!  PEACE LOVE HARMONY
Powerful man...
Simbatv brought me here. Best reaction I have ever seen.
Amazing work here, Tom! Your subjects and wording are always so punk rock it makes me relate every time. Thank you.
Very few songs have ever brought me to tears. This really hit home!
When I was going through treatment one of the main things that got me through was telling myself these lyrics from a WCAR song "Just Keep Breathing"   "If I am still breathing then nothing is as bad as it seems"   Love the song Tom!
Dr. Otto Warburg ... Google him
Thank you for this one Tom. I just lost a best friend in March to lung cancer. I took care of him for his last 6 months on Earth. He was bed ridden.  Taking that kind of care of someone you love does something to you. I needed this song.
The cure is not profitable
My aunt was just diagnosed with pancreatic cancer today, given 3 months. I randomly stumbled upon this song on the same day. It has a lot of my feelings about cancer in it. So much time, research, and money spent and yet they can't even treat let alone cure any type of cancer. Science can be so disappointing sometimes...
great video tom. i cried ✌🏻❤️👍🏻
Beautiful.
This song is letting us know that there is more pain and suffering more than this Covid. Thanks Tom just want to send my love and strength to all that are suffering in a world that’s just lost it’s Focus. X
The ones that dislike this song are heartless.
Running for the cure or running away from the cure?
The cause is our fake ass food, poisonous vaccines, our water, air!! Wake up folks
I lost my aunt April last year. I was with my cousins, my best friends when the doc gave the news that the tumors came back, and there was nothing left to do. One of my worst times. I sat with her when as we all took turns watching her slowly fade away from us. Thank you for speaking the truth and for giving ppl hope. We love you Tom
This song is deep idk how it has so many thumbs down yall are some petty haters
Watched my wife fight and beat canser 3 times in 5 years. Hope that it never returns, becuse the ever existing fear of losing my anchor to this world is horrific.
As a woman in remission from 3rd stage breast cancer I just want to say... ❤ Thank You Tom❤ ...This song says so much in speaking the simple truth and it also says so much about who you are inside....Beautiful
In December it will be 3 years since my grandma passed away from cancer..I was closer to that woman more than anyone else in my family that woman meant the world to me and when she got sick it was so hard watching her go through the months with it, but she was strong about it because she didn't wanna see any of us cry. She was one of those grandmas that treated anyone she met liker her own grandkid, when she got too sick to stay alone she moved in with me and the rest of my family. Eventually it got so bad we had no choice but to put her in hospice and visit her as much as possible. Eventually she stopped moving and talking all together but she was still alive and made it far longer then even the doctors thought possible, I got a call from some family friends visiting her while I was home and she was sitting up talking and being mentally there and everything.I talked to her and I was so happy I started crying and her words were "oh honey don't cry I'm ok" well a couple days later it was about 7:30 pm and I just got home from visiting her and got a call from hospice saying they didn't think she'd make it through the night so me and my family rushed there and before we could get there she had passed.... That night when I went home I had a dream where she walked into our house hugged me and said "You don't have to worry about me I'm in a safe place" and she kissed my cheek and told me she had something under a shelf and when i asked what i woke up. I spent the next week looking everywhere for what she could be talking about and that's when I found her journal...In it she had a letter for me, my mom, and my sisters....ever since then I'll hear her say my name or see her out of the corner of my eye at least once a day no matter where I am...Its about time someone made a song with this much power behind it about a strong subject like this
I cried like a big ass baby. Thank you for this. The world needs a little more empathy.
Castlemans lymphoma non Hodgkins, never will be cured but I’ve adapted. Also you got that scared part right. Scared but I accepted my death on my first major surgery. 10-11 years later and I’m still going. Thank you Tom
😞🥺😢😭😭😭 hermoso 🥺
This is pretty much a conspiracy theory. Sorry if you believe this but just do some research you will understand why we do not have a "cure." Also understand there is a lot more money to be made in a cure than in treatments.
Macklemore is edgy now
💯🔥
Fought twice a brain tumor, meaning a lot to hear this... Brings me back to those times... Glad I made it this far
Thanks for spitting the truth Tom. Lost my dad to pancreatic. Keep doing what you do. Keep showing them yer 🔥🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Insurance wants to charge an arm and a leg, over 1k a month to live. Nearly 1 million for lung transplants. We charge 500 bucks for a bag of saline solution, where its less then 5 dollars in most other places in the world. Yeah I'm spitting hard truths right now. Because its what I deal with every day, every month, and I'll die before I'm 40. The medical industry makes more off you dying then curing or keeping you alive.
Tom you’re saying things i have been saying for years....it breaks my heart i wish things could change. I watched my grandma beat cancer when i was young. It was supposed to take her life but she wasn’t ready.
Google: "turkey tail mushroom cancer"  What comes up?

I lost my mother and my daughter and my daughter was only 14 just last week I lost my cousin. We need a cure
Love the song. I lost my mom to cancer when I was 8 so this hit me hard in the feels.
Lost my dad to glioblastoma 4 years ago hardest thing i ever had to watch as it destroyed my best friend and hero.
This hits, I lost my Nana to cancer in July
The truth
Tom look up Alba Weinman on YouTube  will blow your mind it really is the truth
Love you tom I can relate to this video cause a long time ago at my high school I had pe teacher and staff that died from cancer and some of them died from the radiation treatment and it saddens me. I also had a friend die from cancer along time ago and the sucky part about it is I don't know she was dead and had cancer for awhile until my friend told and hurt so bad. I miss her till this day and I know she is in a good place. R.I.P Ashley. I just want to say to anybody that has a loved one that has cancer to listen to this video and to stay strong and I'm praying for you guys and I hope the sickness goes away. God bless you all. Thank you Tom for the strong message. H.O.G for life.
You Sir are truly AMAZING! I cu#%king love you man your tunes are truly special! Keep it up man 👊🏻
Next super sad song like this should be Abortion  This song got to me tho great job Tom
Wow This is just soooo deep..... He obviously knows something we don't. Is He donating the proceeds to a Cancer Research Foundation or just profiting off of it? weird it doesn't say he is?
I personally have lost my mom to cancer and hearing this song brought tears to my eyes...THANK YOU TOM.
Proud fan from PH here keep it up tom🔥
me seeing her cutting her head   me scrolling down to the comments while hearing the boss music    but dont worry we beat the boss no "I like your cut g" here only love
This song is personal to everyone listening. May god send the cure
i had breast cancer last year after 2 lumpectomys it is now gone.
This is the same guy who rapped about being a straight white male... ngl I like the character development! He’s talking about real world problems and meaningful lyrics! This is exactly what we need in a time like this 🙏
Wow! This guy is fire!!
My grandmother had breast cancer. I helped take care of her, and everything. When she passed it broke me. Heaven gained another beautiful soul that day.
Seen you on FB story. To share. I did. Just beat Cancer fkr the 3rd time. This hit home so hard. As you sit in the chair. You wonder where we go after. Is heaven real? Am I going there? Im glade you made this song.
when i hear this i don't understand how people can hate on him. he have meaningfull lyrics. People is just  hateing on him because his different from the other rappers.
Genius
I'm surprised at how low budget this video is. And wtf is up with the doctors eyebrows?
This song makes me cry every time I hear it because I lost my last year cause of breast cancer and I'm only 15 I miss my mom so much I know my mom didn't want anything she has been through I would give my life to bring my mom back but i know you can't bring people back from the dead my mom didn't deserve any of this she has been dealing with cancer ever since 2012 she was the strongest person I knew  she fought for 7 years hoping the cancer would go away but it didn't...i love you mom I hope I see you again soon R.I.P ❤❤😭🙏
Now I'm no doctor, so take everything I say with a grain of salt. However, from what I understand, cancer isn't just *cancer*. Even specific kinds of cancer aren't the same. Cancer being a mutation of a cell, it's different in everyone. The term cancer covers so many kinds of mutations, that once cannot simply make a "Cure" for it. Radiation kills cells. Not just cancer cells though, of course radiation has no bias. It kills all cells equally. It's hard to imagine any one Medicine being able to target thousands and thousands of different types of cell mutations, without it harming good cells too. After all, a medicine it's sentient. It doesn't make choices. Your body is what makes the choices. Just how people get the flu despite having a flu shot. Different mutations of the same thing. The common cold? Not so common in a sense. Thousands of different infections are all placed under the term "Common Cold." That's what makes cancer hard to cure.
I lost my Father, Sister, mother-in-law, Aunt, cousin and four dear friends to cancer. My husband is a cancer survivor. And the girl who was my best friend in high school is a cancer survivor. They could cure this if they wanted.
Damn good tom ..great topic man my roomate has cancer but he is fighting to stay alive and chnging his eating habits...prayers bro👼
Extra extra. Read all about it. They found the cure from dying with cancer.  They'll give it you're loved on as long as someone more wealthy doesn't need it.
You’re cancer...
Wow, a Tom MacDonald song finally on trending! #8 right now
I'm not crying, you're crying 😢
Damnit Tom... I didnt need a good cry but i got one. Thanks brotha.
Man you did your thing again this one hits to the heart bro
This song is brilliant, man. Honestly.  My father passed away early this year after his battle with cancer. It was sad to see him go through what he did for the two years, but I'm happy he's finally at peace. It's such an awful disease.
Im proud of you Tom
Thank you for this. It couldn't have come at more needed time for me. I lost my grandpa to cancer in January two weeks before my birthday. Lost my mom to addiction on Valentine's day two weeks before my husband's birthday, and then we lost his aunt to cancer a month later. Now three weeks ago my mother in law finally went to the Dr after the family hounding her for months and it turns out she has a small lump of cancer on her brain and stage 4 terminal lung cancer that's pushing against her heart. We're all staying strong for her and she wants to fight but 2020 has about taken all the hope I have left to give. Thank you Tom. ♥️ I needed this more than you know
I lost my dad, grandma, grandpa, and several others to cancer. I've watched them all suffer and die. Diagnosed my dad and 6 months later he died when I held his hand. For a long time I blamed myself for his death cuz my hands were cold from being outside during winter. I felt like I put him into shock
Amazing song!  Just lost my aunt a few days ago to cancer, and my mother to it back when I was 11. Got me crying over here now thinking about it all.
My dad has 3 different types of stage 4 cancer in his body and he already fought stage 4 throat cancer 6 years ago. Im living everyday like he is dead and dying because i dont know when he will just collapse... Im sick of this shit..
Thank you bro
I’m literally crying. Awesome artist!
Here’s the secret, there is no preventative cure for cancer and there never will be. Everything causes it and all we can do is develop better therapeutics to defeat it. For those interested in seeing the progress we’ve made and shortcomings we’ve hit read Emperor of all Maladies, an Biography on Cancer.
Really happy to see Tom putting out such  a positive message, and bringing awareness to something that has affected so many people.
Amazing song . Amazing talent amazing beat
Wwe 2020 yes
Awesome song!! They dont want a cure for cancer or aids. The pharmaceutical companies are SO POWERFUL & make way to much money off the meds & would literally have ANYONE KILLED who made a cure that  would cost them trillions. That's the true reality of it. They don't want a cure. Money ALWAYS overtakes EVERYTHING, even human lives. So sad the greedy world we live in. Thanks Tom
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
!@!@!@  Tom, reason 1,279 why i will always be H.O.G. The empathy.... Fck, i love ya and everything you do.
My 8 year old daughter has been fighting brain cancer for over a year. This song hit me and my wife right in the ❤️
If lost my sister 2 months ago because of cancer this have me in tears wish I could just give a one more hug and tell her how much I love her.  Thanx for this Tom !!!!!!
Dr Royal Rife
Awesome I'm currently relocating my entire life because my dad is ill but no hesitation family first.
Thanks Tom @hangovergang. I've been fighting Breast Cancer a month shy of 6 years. I have treatment every 3 weeks and take a handful of meds to keep the cancer from coming back. I've got a family (husband of 23 years and 3 boys) to fight for. But I do know where I'm going when I die. I'm Heaven bound. Cancer does affect everyone. It sucks. But thanks for giving a crap!
Much Love Sir, Royal Rife.
There is a cure. Hang on. Praise Jesus!
Might? There is a heaven and there is a hell.CHOOSE JESUS!
i honestly have such mixed emotions about this song;
Words led of dead contempt controversy cons.piracy=words created cancer.
Tom that is a Fuckin Deep song....I love that you talk about real shit....Thank you
I cant wait 4 fantano and Layedbakdfr to react 2 this
Uncle e Nanny p  Aunt c  Aunt s Uncle m  R.i.p ❤
Beautiful ❤
They care more for the Almighty dollar thanthe sufferings , sad.
God bless everyone no one deserves to die not even young kids so god please protect them. Amem
I pray God save this young man and use him he’s full of truth!
😢this so sad 😭 heart Felt ❤️
One of your best Tom my wife had breast Cancer and luckily after 4 years beat it and I couldn't be more thankful I only wish all survives
YES! Beautifully written. Love 💕 LOVE this so much. I can’t stop listening to this, as It’s been on repeat...Definitely one of the best songs I’ve ever heard. 🏆
I really hope this song blows up more than any of his songs, just because it isnt controversial doesn't mean it deserves any less attention
Dude be lookin like the physical representation of cancer
Seriously who TF gives this a thumbs down... Heartless
1 thousand diss'... 1000 people can't feel... 😭
Amazing man 🖤😔🖤
Cool music😎👌💎💰💸
It took my dad when I was 2 my mum got it a few years bk but beat it cheers Tom ✊
This guy is so cringy.. not even rap he just talks
My poor mother, I love you and miss you. You're no longer in pain. And for that I should be grateful. But now my heart is in pain.

Tom I'm speechless your amazing brother..
Only one word "legendery" 💯🙌
Amazing job bro.have listened 20 times and bawled my eyes out every time,throughout the entire song.the world needs more of this! It's extremely moving for sure.my youngest son just beat brain cancer this year at the age of 3!! To all those still fighting,NEGU..never ever give up! 🤟
this is amazing man. amazing. ❤
So powerful
respect bro <3
Only Tom can make me cry eyes out listening to music. This just hit like a truck, made me sit in my feelings and shit. Keep it up Tom you’re what people need rn
When I was younger my grandfather had prostate cancer but my family never told me what was wrong they just told me he was sick. I could have lost him back then but nobody thought i had the right to know for whatever reason
I used to hate Tom but now I respect him so much for this, one of my friends died from cancer 2 years ago and this song makes me think of her. THANK YOU TOM SO DAMN MUCH💜💜💜  RIP to all the ppl who died of cancer
“you won’t know why you have faith till you look the devil in his face. you don’t know what you can take till you realize that you didn’t break.” powerful.
You finally realized what you are good job
PLEASE DON'T EVER CHANGE! ✨💖✨
Damn bro, you've got me tearing up about my mom's on-going battle. Good message man
Nice song Mate.
Legendary
I am glad I got my daughter listening to you. You are sincerely my hero. Your courage, heart, soul and talent could light up a universe.
OMG bro this song hit deep. I have been a huge fan since you started speaking facts. This has to be the very first time one of your songs hit me hard. I have lost many relatives to cancer and 2 and a half years ago I lost someone special to me that I had been with for 10 years to throat cancer that spread so fast the doctors wouldn't even attempt to treat her and she wound up passing away at night while laying in the bed beside me. They put trillions into research for what 60+ years and still no cure??? I call BS
Tbh this song is dogshit
Bravo
Why does he sound like the kid on the st Judes commercials ?
yep... hitting home.
Amen brother! Love this new song.
*So beautiful...I'm into music,please check my channel out:)*
Keep spitting Truth brother
Holy shit man this song is going to help so many peoples spirits
God mode bro. Fuckin love your shit
Cancer... I rebuke you in the name of GOD.......
Beautiful song❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Don't look the colour is icon
I love this song because my aunt Natalie pass way too weeks stage four breast cancer ♋️  and my best friend Marvin stage four balls cancer ♋️ and my best friend mom pass way too
Wired how the Bible says do not fear...  365 times ... when you say pray I almost think you get it ... Jesus said ... pray like this ... Heavenly Father ... help me in this minute... you are Holy ... and I need you ... just for a minute... I pray everyday and now I got a request... your will be done ... here as in heaven... but they say she not gonna live ... give me this day my daily bread... thank you GOD... without you I’m dead ... forgive me I’ve sinned... forgive me of those... I’ve stopped... and I make amends... for the kingdom I serve belongs to you... thank you father all power and glory to you... in Jesus name amen...
Brilliant as always Tom.
I hope you see this Tom. I'm not even joking for a second... unfortunately I discovered you because of cancer, during chemo back in March of 2020, I have chemo until March of 2021. Fortunately, I discovered you because cancer Tom! I listen to you ALL THE TIME your tracks are so fire and inspiring and true. Keep it up! I'll keep fighting!!💪💪 @evo_ross on insta has a little bit of my story if you care to check it out🙂
Thank you. This needs to be brought to light. People need to be woke to the war being fought by cancer victims and survivors that are deprived of the cure by the government and big pharma. Thank you. You are more than awesome.
There are extremely powerful, cancer killing antioxidants available that big pharma does everything to hide.
This song has a whole different meaning when it attacks those you love it took both my grandmothers my father and my mother in law and watching each one go from indestructible to the last days of life this song really can make a person cry.  Damn it you are one of the only ones on real issues dont you change
I have so many friends affected by cancer, some beat it and some unfortunately didn't. One of my best friends joined the army and medically discharged after his diagnosis and lost his battle at 23. My heart goes out to everyone and anyone that's been affected by this horrible disease! Thanks for making this Tom, this really got me in feels. Keep doing what your doing, cause your crushing it right now.
WOW!! So powerful...this is the best one you've ever done
Tom if you see this this is the cancer. Anthem please reply
My son just had his final chemo in December 💛 he kicked cancer's ass!
Good song
As a 29yo grade 4 brain cancer patient with two small children this song really hits home.
I'm Fighting with cancer right now
Of course they well never give us the cure there's no profit in it  They can only make money if they treat a patient there's no money in a cured person
Amazing men give me chills 😭❤️❤️❤️
This is cringe and an obvious attempt at replicating something like Macklemore & Ryan Lewis - SAME LOVE.
Honestly I needed this today , lifted me up when I need it most.  #respect
TRASH
Oh i bet Mr Anthony Fantano will not make fun of this song Tom. Keep on keep on stay the course Tom MacDonald
I survived cancer but not every one is as fortunate it kills so many Tom making this song is amazing
Brought a tear to my eye made me remember all the not so bad times after hospice got called in for my grandfather thank you TOM
Amazing ..touched my heart my ACE who stood by my side through all 3 battles and my sons and a loving mother !!!  TRULY LOVE CONQUEROR'S ALL... We lost a lot to help me fight to help me live we sacrificed several places to stay repos personal heirloom's material loss to us all to help me live today  Their sacrifices of my army I will never be able to repay 100% back but the tremendous out pouring of their prayers and faith meant the most  Cancer touches us all in one way or another I pray 1 day my family gets all their blessings back 10fold !! Tom and Nova  Cheers to you !! Love this to tears!!! Clap 👏clap 👏 Keep the great inspirations up !!! Proud of you both  1
Brooooo...    this hit way different
My grandma had 6 cancers thru her life... her last cancer took her life away. RIP grandma💖 I love you
AMAZING
Man. This song hit hard cause I've know lots of people that had cancer and only 3 of them were able to overcome it. The rest didn't make it.
I cried like the day we found out my wife had cancer.
GODZILLA APPROVES!!  Thanks Tom.. for singing about real shiznit.. and being bold enough to say.. hey people.. we are all in this together.. stop looking away!!
My wife is a breast cancer survivor. I love her more than life itself
My friend in middle school & my grandfather & my husband's aunt & dad have cancer
Ugly dude
My dad died from bowel and stomach cancer when I was 5. I was on the same path of destruction! Rehab and 3 different counsellors could not help me! I gave my life to Jesus Christ and am now 7 months clean hallelujah! Jesus is real Jesus is alive meet him on this side of eternity not when it's too late!! God bless you Tom praying for you!!
Tom you are my new hero, keep doing what you do, diagnosed in 2018 just had a baby boy in June. God is watching hopefully
Tom MacDonald: Posts  Everyone: Lets scroll down through the comments
Awesome song love it God bless, oh and whom ever gave this song a thumbs down is dead inside already!!!!! ❤️
Man, everytime I think you won't be able to come up with another meaningful topic you prove me wrong.
❤️
WHO IN THE HELL WOULD DISLIKE THIS!?
This is trash
⛄💖iT remember this liFe is a test so do goOd bRo sometimes I think that this liFe is a bad dream and when you die yOu awake up let's see
1.7k dislikes are cancer “researcher”
This hit different 😢 I’ve had many friends fight cancer some won and some lost 😢😢😢
Check out - James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo have been awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their discovery of a type of cancer treatment that harnesses a person's own immune system, the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet announced this morning (Oct. 1).
That shit took both my beautiful amazing loving and caring parents away from me and my wonderfully amazing sister. Which cancer almost took her away from me as well but thanks to God they caught the cancerous cell early on and got to operate on her so thanks to God she's cancer free today.
The video turned out exactly, just as I had imagined it would be when I listed to the song for weeks on end in my car! The song has a beautiful, empowering chorus and also gives you things to think about! One of my grandfathers, who was a decorated Red Army veteran, passed away from cancer long before I was born and unfortunately I never met this incredibly interesting and accomplished man, from the stories my grandmother told me. I also witnessed the effects of cancer on two of my longtime high school friends who luckily are both survivors. Cancer is an awful illness and it will affect all of us in some way or another. F**k cancer! #Cancer #tommacdonald
Hey Tom MacDonald I don’t know if you will ever read this but In the off chance that you do actually read it I want to say this. Thank you. I thank you for making this song. I’m a 17 year old male from utah and I struggle with a lot. Cancer is one of those things that has touched my core I have lost a good amount of amazing people to various forms of cancer. Doctors said I wasn’t supposed to be born because my mother had cervical cancer twice and the procedures had a high chance of making it so she couldn’t give birth. Recently my uncle passed away from pancreatic cancer and it touched me deeply. I want to send this song to my aunt but I know how emotional she is whenever a thought of him comes up and I don’t know if I should send it to her. I find this song true to every message it states and I also find it as an uplifting and empowering song. I just don’t know if I should take the risk of sending it to her with the state that she is in mentally when this topic comes up. I think that if she heard it she would be uplifted but also would end up in tears from the memories. She is in a worse mental state than the rest of the family over it cuz it was her husband. Knowing that the topic fucks me up I know it would really fuck her up emotionally with memories as well. Please give me some advice on what I should do because I really do want to help and I really do believe this song is an amazing contribution to everyone impacted by cancer.
This hits hard, My grandpa has stage 4 lung cancer....He wont last much longer
That's what beautiful about tom mcdonald rap..his raps are not only about beefs and self struggle, they talk about every issues out there. ❤️
Damn Tom...well done!!!!
January 17 2018 I had a seizure at work. I don’t have seizures but I woke up in the hospital. They found a brain tumor about the size of a golf ball. It caused the seizure. Surgery was February 28, cancer diagnosis was March 17. I have been back working for a year now. This song means so much to me and my family. Thank you Tom for helping so many people.
CRISPR-Cas9 can cure Cancer. Jennifer Doudna just received the Nobel Prize for it.
Thanks for this Tom! I know you receive many comments and cannot reply to them all. You are a true truth teller in a form that resinates with so many people in every kinda situation they’re going through in their lives. I lost my mom this May to blood cancer and due to government overreach, she died alone in hospice.... I could not be there to hold my moms hand while she passed, but all the protests are allowed to happen. This world is truly evil... Listening to your music has helped me in many ways, thank you! 🙏🏻❤️
I appreciate these kind of songs by you Tom. I miss my grandfather. He's resting in his rocking chair amongst the stars now.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏🙏
Thank you!!!!! Crazy my daughter was diagnosed Oct 16th 2016.   I lost her @ 11 year old  from cancer.. #cruiseforkarma
Tom MacDonald is the most talented rapper out there hands down. Keep making songs Tom people love you!
4 MORE YEARS TRUMP 2020
My father died from cancer on my birthday 4 years ago I miss him so much.
Thank you man much appreciation on my end and you manage to drop this song when I found out a family member of mine has been diagnosed with the C word and it is really helping me deal with the situation
🙏🙏🙏🙏
I can almost get through the song before crying but still not yet, plus this time I remembered when I found out my mom had ovarian cancer and decided after the first day of going with her for the treatment, that night I shaved my head and told her the next day that I would rather have people looking at me then her should she lose her hair, and being a cosmetologist i got her hair extensions to wear when her hair started to get really thin. She never fully lost all her hair and I'd like to think and believe it's because I shaved mine.  Xoxo 💜💜💜
Respect Tom the greatest this world is always hiding shit from us keep ur music going I’m a big fan
Yeah, wasn't expecting to cry on this one. Lol. Thank you for this song, I definitely needed it. Your music is 🔥🔥🔥. Keep doing what you do, my man. Much love.
Any person who has disliked this song has no soul nd the world needs you gone nd Tom you are a legend man the world gunna know you nd the real will stand by your side 🔥💯🌹
This song ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ RIP my darling mom 😞
Another trash song, this guy doesn't miss.
The new GOAT
I wish a cure is found for cancer. But this song is trash, he does it again.
Tom macdonald has to be in the Top 10 most woke human beings in the history of mankind.
Spitting the truth like the GOAT
Think about this in a music video the music is just playing in the background because it’s gonna be edited. LOOK AT THE EMOTION ON HIS FACE, HE TRULY CARES, TOM IS A BLESSING, AND I TRULY APPRECIATE YOU, YOURE A LIVING LEGEND ❤️🙌🏻 #hangovergangforlife
💖💖💖💖 facts
I lost my father to cancer, he went down fighting and enjoying the last of his life. Love your music and inspiration brother.
Amen Tom! Keep dropping truth! Damn do we ever need it as a nation.
Image disliking this video
Wow !       My sister died of cancer of the bones 8 years ago ,  she could walk in the end. It’s not nice seeing my mother crying because her daughter went before her  .   You have got me in tears here .    Thank you writing this song.  It’s means a lot to know that a person like yourself is so passionate about this subject .You are one great man Tom .  Much love and respect to you . I wish this song was around when I my sister was alive , she would have got comfort from it . Amazing song .  Going to share this with all my friends .   Thank you Sir.
Such a strange rebrand by Macklemore
It's refreshing to see a comment section this original
I lost a grandfather, a close family friend to cancer.  My dad was diagnosed with prostrate cancer 5 years ago and beat it.   This song got me.
God entered into my body, as a body. the same size. worlds only holy ghost filled man. God attacks me, rips my face, and shoots into mouth gum disease. JEsus appears and laughs.
GEOENGINEERING  MAN MADE CANCER AND CLIMATE CATASTROPHE is the new world order .   UNITED NATIONS AGENDA 21 NEW WORLD ORDER  GLOBAL DEPOPULATION   GOD IS REAL 💛
Thank you!!!
I'm still trying to figure u out lol
Wow. This is real.

Believe me this story he tell is the truth all fact
Survivor of Nero endocrine carcinoma here.....keep your head up and spirits high, and family close
Mann.. This hit hit different..😥 the realness..
My new favorite song frfr
Everybody knows someone who's sick 40 percent will get cancer, only half's gonna live Your mom and your dad and your sister stand inside a room And someone won't survive it, do you hope it isn't you?  [Verse 1] I swear that cancer has a cure but they're refusin' to make it They done like 40 years of research, 90 billion in donations We've been runnin' for the cure and wearin' ribbons for ages Why are people still goin' through radiation? It's crazy Hundred billion dollar industry, they can't afford to end it And nobody wants to die, our only option is to spend it We'd givе anything to stick around for just another second Give a fortunе to the doctors who promise they can extend it The profits are astronomic, the hospitals and the clinics Are fillin' coffins with dollars, it's awful, let's just admit it We're all human, we'll keep on fightin' 'cause it's how we survive But it's scary 'cause we don't know where we'll go when we die  [Chorus] Don't give up and know you're strong Show them all your fire The days are hard the nights are long But you are a fighter When it's dire you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor when you're tired You hold tighter, you have heart   [Verse 2] Nothin' matters if you don't have your health All the money in the world doesn't help The good might go to heaven and the bad might go to hell But no one wants to leave here, you can tell And cancer touches everyone, it's in our genetics And our world's become so toxic, it's all carcinogenic We've polluted the water, the air, the food we're ingestin' It's full of hormones and poison, our population's infected They sell us cigarettes and liquor, built a business on addictions We've been payin' them to kill ourselves, we're dyin' to keep livin' It's the system, it's a prison, we keep tryin' to beat it We get cancer from keepin' all our demons a secret And our insurance don't cover the things we need to defeat it And even if it does we then we might die from the treatment Our best defense is livin' like we do not know what cancer is Fight it if you have it and pray that there's somethin' after this  [Chorus] Don't give up and know you're strong Show them all your fire The days are hard the nights are long But you are a fighter When it's dire you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor when you're tired You hold tighter, you have heart  [Bridge] You won't know how to be brave until you chose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength until you've struggled to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith until you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take until you realize you didn't break  [Chorus] Don't give up and know you're strong Show them all your fire The days are hard the nights are long But you are a fighter When it's dire you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor when you're tired You hold tighter, you have heart
Wow that was a right hook to the feels bro, well done needed saying.
Thank you for making this My uncle a single father in debt was diagnosed with a tumor and then his girlfriend left him for another person while he was going through treatment his ex wife sued him to pay child support for all of his 4 children from his recent marriage with her he works a lot but doesn't get paid a lot he has survived it thank God and hopefully it does not come back his newborn son is currently living with me while he pays for child support and goes to work and finds a home
@Tom MacDonald, you're are growing on me man.  I'm not the type of person that likes RAP. Keep up the good work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This shoud be the new theme song for the cancer fight 💯 💯
sad the lengths he goes through to play on sympathy. fake outrage is dead and now this
I needed this man. I lost my Nan to cancer nearly 4 years ago. She had dizzy spells but insisted she was fine. Boxing day she fell and was taken to hospital, they did tests etc, and after 5 days in hospital, they told her she had two types of cancer. As soon as they told her, her mind snapped. She started talking to herself, and seeing things that weren't there. She stayed in hospital for another two weeks, her mind deteriorating every day, constantly saying she just wanted to go home. Finally they allowed her home, and arranged for carers to visit. Soon as she was home, she stopped seeing things and talking to herself, but she wasn't eating properly. After 11 days at home, she passed away. I was working that day and she kept asking for me. I went straight there after work, and just sat and held her hand. She had tears in her eyes and could barely speak. When I left, I knew she wouldn't last the night. A few hours later, at 2:40 am I had a call from my auntie (we took it in turns to stay the night with her) saying she had passed. I believe my Nan had held on to see me one last time.  She basically raised me, my parents split and I lived with my dad because I raced motocross, and my dad would make sure I raced. My Nan looked after me while dad was working. She would make my dinners and then make my sister and dad theirs. (I raced mx at a professional level, and had strict meal plans) my Nan came to every race, all over the UK. She would sleep in the motor home with us. One race was in winter in Scotland, it was snowing and freezing cold. I had to race as it was a round of the British championship, and my Nan insisted on coming along anyway, even though the motorhome would be freezing cold at night. She wanted to be there.  I miss my Nan so much, she was an amazing woman. She made it to 81 years old, and passed two weeks before her 82nd birthday.  We called her the old badger, because her hair went Gray in stripes, looking like a badgers fur.  Rip old badger, miss you loads.  Thank you Tom, this is such a beautiful song. Much love from the uk.
I'm 23, in 2012 my mom passed from cancer. She had the cancer since she was 17, when my father and and grandmother persuaded her to undergo treatments and surgery she left us 3 months later. She was 43 at the time, and in the end the doctors finally admitted she'd had lived longer if she didnt take the risks of treatment and surgery. I'm aware there are thousands out here with similar experiences some worse than others. I just want to thank you Tom, and let everyone know. There's much love amongst those of us who understand the trials. And much respect to you.
Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16   God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.
Dog Dewormer cures cancer... Google it!
I thought this guy was some rapper but he really is a one of a kind musician
The last words my husband said to me in hospice before he died were "when you finally come to heaven?... Will you still be mine?" ... I kissed his head and told him I didn't know if thats how it works , but I promise will see eachother again . Our love is eternal ... this is beautifully written tom..
i cry man cause i going through right now by my mom had breast cancer but they caught it in time so now she get treatment every week so i pray it don't come back
Best one yet
R.I.P Mom... March 15 2020 stage V breast cancer.
It's what we eat and meds we injest that causes the cancer cells in the human body to react. A lot of the foods destroys our immune system. It's called immune system for a reason. There's a lot of medications that take years to dissolve in our bodies and it messes with the cells in the human body.
ONE LOVE...GOD GANG💣
And to all yall victims to this awful disease...don't give it a name..your just sick for a min...🙏☝to all yall..don't give it a name...power to that😁💋
Curing cancer is so difficult because it is just a malfunction of our own cells, hopefully they will be able to edit our genetic code with crispr in the future so cancer will be a thing of the past.
I love this song i lost my mom to cancer at 14 years old 6/30/66 to 4/24/14
💜💜💜💜💜🙏☝to you your wowman.and to 🇺🇸 US!!!....GET IT IN THEN😁💪💪💪💪💪
Great song man! The chorus is fantastic!
❤♥️❤♥️❤♥️❤
i used to be a fan of the you posted your second most recent video and i am no longer a fan of you
Yo this song is so good my gf just finished the fight and it means a lot to us u made something so positive and strong
8 years cancer-free.
My step mom literally just got cancer
The dislikes are probably the doctors and big pharma not liking that he speaks the truth or its heartless assholes.
*Please listen* .. Heaven and hell are not determined by being good or bad. Heaven is the place where mankind spends eternity with the Creator whom they decided they want to be with. Hell is the place where mankind spends eternity away from the Creator whom they decided they don't want to be with. He settled the score, it's not what we do, we were all doomed to Hell because we are all disobedient, it's our acceptance of His gift, Himself, that He bought and paid for. Please, *please* seek Him out, *you will find Him* and He loves you so much!
Tom is the ultimate cancer
You're a legend
This hits home for a lot of people, I lost my aunt to stomach cancer, and I lost my best friend to brain cancer it sucks
As a cancer survivor, this speaks volumes. Cancer is a race. It's marathon, but there's an end. Don't quit. Ever. Thanks Tom 👍
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼such a real song
Thank You
Thank you for this song, Tom. It really hits home. I sent it to my stepmom. They told her she has stage 4 breast cancer and only has 6 months to live.
Dang... Peace Tom. Hits home. Peace goes out.
This is the truth!!!! My Mother had Breast Cancer And because of coronavirus her surgery was delayed, she had her surgery but now spread to her blood. I’m praying it’s not too late. It’s so hard for me to cope with it all💔 I lost my bro on Christmas day 2017 now this. #Breastcancerawareness #Cancer 🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀
Godbless anyone goin thru it
Major respect. No other artist speaks/makes songs about real life problems.
Vaccines are FULL of carcinogens
Powerful my bro ! Appreciate you...
Are you honestly making money off this song, that's kinda fd up! I'd take 100% of the profits from this song and donate it to some kind of cancer research institution or child's cancer hospital.
DAMN THAT HIT DIFFERENT!!💔😭
God loves you https://youtu.be/Wh1VU-_OF98

I lost my grandma in March of this year to stage 4 cancer she never knew she had it the doctor said she had for ten years and never knew it she had a couple falls and we took her to the doctor and he said the falls is what triggered it and she found out Jan. 10th and she passed away March 11th I was by her side holding her hand when she took her last breathe I not only lost my grandma but I lost my mom and my best friend she has rasied me she was always there no matter what there's not a day that has went by that I don't wana pick up the phone and call her just to hear her voice one more time cuz in the end she couldn't talk it took her down so quick so quick it was in her lungs her brain she had a huge mass on her chest making it hard to breathe I know she's watching over me and I know she's in a better place a LOT better than this hell and one day I will see her again and until then i will continue looking up and knowing she's right here in my heart forever and always ❤ 💘🌹👼💔💌
Beautiful song , saw this on a youtube ad and me and my fiance couldn't skip it. Great song, great eye opener . Thank you ❤️
The style of this track is like a combo of Prince Ea and Owl City. Very interesting. And the message is on point as usual. Fuck big pharma.
Spot on. More truth in this than most want to acknowledge.
This was sad bro, almost cried, I’m going to go listen to your hard music to rebuild my walls now hahahaha thank you for being yourself, always.💯
Damn onions
He always has the same hooks true lyrics but it's not a song ud bang out of your car or in a club my opinion I don't want to hear I'm hating cas I'm not honest opinion if I like a song he does I say it .u cant say anything bad people just on slag u say stupid shit  .
I love Tom Macdonald and the message he is sending for the record. Your the man, and I give so much credit to Nova for all of her hard work making your vision come to life.
This was beautiful
I thought people hated this man
I'm straight up crying.. Being a survivor this is really touching ♥️
Great song. Great message. Thank you for speaking to people in a positive way ❤
My best friend past away from cancer miss him a lot will never forget him as long as I live miss him every day.
My mother in law passed away from cancer. It was hard seeing her that way, but she always had a smile on her face. I miss her very much.
DAMN!
Come on tom u can hit trending #1. Keep it real man. Ur definitely cut from a different cloth. U show the world what it is to be urself an not to worry what others say in life. U changed me in many ways man. Keep it up, hang over gang forever.
I always appreciate your lyrics, music and respect you Tom ... my grandad died early this year from cancer .. and I still miss him .. I miss his laughter, jokes, hugs and smiles .. I miss his happiness, he gave us all happiness and so much more, and the people in his neighbourhood.. I wish o spent more time with him - anyway, thank you for these lyrics to help people feel stronger
This song couldn't have released on a perfect time and day. I have an Aunt currently in the hospital fighting her cancer as I write this. She can't get her temp to go down. She is fighting and she has been fighting for a while. I also have an uncle who is just slowly decaying because of Cancer. Thank you Tom for this amazing song I hope when I show it to my aunt and uncle they continue to fight.
Thank you for not being afraid to tell the truth.
I know where I am going when I die, praise Jesus.
So beautiful! 😢 Keep On Fighting!!
❤❤❤❤
My mum had cancer and my sister both are still alive tho thank god 🙏
Hold up 1.6k thumbs down y’all people are sick. These people have no heart. Seriously this song goes deep especially if someone you love or someone you know has cancer. Tom Great song. People don’t like to hear facts and this is what this guy does spits it well.
my mom has cancer. Thank you Tom. ❤️
Beautiful song. What is wrong with the 1.6k that have thumbs down? Guess they never had someone they love fight with all they have left or maybe they just don't care.
So much truth love this
I hope this blows up. I hope everyone sees it. There is a cure for cancer but none of us are allowed to have it. What hes talking about is if you have a chronic illness it will eventually become cancer bc it was never treated. Doctors treat the symptoms not the cause and that cause will kill you.
This song really hit home just lost my mom March 5th 2020 from cancer thanks tom for the video
Show them your 🔥
Absolutely beautiful, Tom. Love it!~
I hope Tom gets nut cancer
I just lost 2 of my uncles to cancer every word of this song means something to me
My uncle died of cancer August 21st... mine and my wife's wedding day. My other uncle died 3 years ago of cancer.. grandpa hasn't had it and neither has my dad but for all I know its skipping them and coming to me. We will see...
I lost my dad 4 months ago. Lung cancer he is my hero and the strongest man I've ever know. He did want the cancer to take him because he battled so hard. So he to the side of the house and shot him. We have no one anymore. My kids looked at him as dad as well. Now all I see is his Beautiful blue eyes staring up at the sky like he praying.
My grandma had breast cancer and she loves this song. You all are amazing.
damn bro thats the truth we dont realize this for most of us
Powerful! There's more money in the disease than in the cure. Too many people getting rich off the lives of too many. 😢
Refreshing to see you make a song about something important. Instead of whining about being white or screaming about how many fucks you don’t give.
Check out emolga swift please 👍
Man!!! This is......... I can't Explain 😢😢😢..man....!!!! That lyrics......
Just what I wanted to do was cry then see my girl crying as we listened to this.
Love you Bro ❤
My uncle and grandfather both died of colorectal cancer last year. All I can say is thank you Tom Macdonald not alot of people talk about this and I'm glad you did. Thank you!
People usually die from the radition poisoning. They had all those stockpiles of agent orange. Greedy evil couldn't let it go to waste, so they repurposed it into chemical radiation poison, aka "chemotherapy". Look into it! Fact.
The reason why we don’t have a cure yet is because they rather make millions off Cemo and Radiation. It’s true sad world we are in! Prayers for all those going through this!!! 💚💚💚💚
What’s with the Christian rap nowadays?
My father. It was terrible. Thank you.
🔥👍🔥💪🔥🤛
My father had lung cancer when he was 16. After all the treatments, my uncle told me it basically just fried him. He beat it but he only had one and a half lungs after. He lived to get married and have my 5 older siblings and me. But even after all that fighting to stay alive, my mother died when I was 5 and that broke my father. He had to get heart surgery and because of the valve replacement he would get sick a lot. By the time I was 15 he got pneumonia and while in the hospital he contracted a staph infection that killed him. I saw my mother pass away, then I saw my father, my hero, the strongest man I ever knew, grow weak and small, smaller and weaker then I was at 15, and watched him pass. I know they have a cure for so many illnesses, but they won’t keep making money if they cure illness.
2008 survivor I love your rawness and how real you are I'm a huge fan.
i understand the meaning, my mom had cancer. but this song is just not it. as cringe as you can get.
I lost my great grandma, my grandma and my grandpa to cancer. It runs in my family.
I usually think this dude is goofy but this video really hit hard..
I’ve watch this fucking video over 20 times. And every time I tear up and think of my aunt and all we went thru...
Damn. I am a single mom to a 4 yr old daughter with Acute Myeloid Leukemia. This song hit home. Thanks Tom. If anyone wants to donate to treatment cost and expenses and all cashtag is $brittgod1989
The only thing I am glad I am not seeing i the comment section yet is 'He or she is watching over me now as an angel.' That is not Biblical. Humans DO NOT die then have the option to be transformed to angels. All Bibles agree this is not an option or ever will be. It wouldnt even make sense from a Heavenly hierarchy. To be watching over you or I who was saved in Christ, possibly, but not unsaved and out of Christ. That's even debatable since the Bible says 'the dead know nothing.' If you have any hope at all, you better at least get right with Christ and make him here my Lord and Savior that's what he said I am the way, the truth and the life no man comes to the father except through me.' It is as black and white as the pages. No other has been the son of God and lived as a human and died like we wil. That is why he was born here, lived here and had not sinned so that He could show us it was possible and we would see for ourselves. Let The Holy Spirit be your teacher and gifted to you - only at the time of your salvation in Christ Jesus. Not religion but your personal walk.
i saw this happen with a friend of mine at a young age, still miss him a lot :'( crying my eyes out but i love this song so much. thanks Tom for having such amazing music <3 that touches peoples hearts
My name is Robert Santos jr I was born with cancer didn’t hit me till age 4 my whole life was a battle in an out of the hospital for years then a miracle happened I lost it at age 10 now I live a happy life with my family and still pushing strong 27 yrs old now I fought Leukemia and survived great song brother 🤟🏼🤟🏼💪🏻💪🏻
My friends Mimi had cancer and beat it. This song makes me think of her
As a fighter/survivor of leukemia twice now this hits home. Thank you for for this 🙏🙏🙏. Keep doing what your doing!
My mother has had cancer three times she beat it but the cancer caused her body to put calcium in her blood vessels and now she's got a year to live at most I feel like giving up but this music this raper tom macdonald helps me keep going Ps my mom believes that when she dies it's ok but to me it's not she's the only parent I have left
❤️
Me my wife and baby listen to all your drops on YT good work makes me wanna call my god mother who last I talked to had cancer and she was one of the good one's in my dads family sucks I lost contact
*THE TRUTH IS WE ARE PLANT BASE VEGAN ORGANISMS.ONLY MEANT TO EAT ANIMAL PRODUCTS IN FAMON TO SURVIVE.*  *EAT PLANTBASE AN LIVE. OR DONT AT YOUR OWN PERIL.*  *BE MAD.*  *YOU HAVE BEEN LIED TO.*
Bro this hit home really hard my mom did chemo on Wednesday and she is still fighting thank you for this
Look I'm not saying they're can't be a song about this, BUT There can't be a song like this
Tom Bro You Are The Best At What You Do!💯😈
Watched this probably 20 times so far, bawled every time. The cleanest feeling tears since my dad died at the end of January. Thanks Tom🙏
One of my faves so far you always hit home with your music keep up the good work bro we love you
Thanks for this man❤️  Lost my sweet grandma to lung cancer, it sucks it really does. There absolutely nothing we could’ve done. It’s been 10 years since she passed and I still cry when I hear the word cancer. #FUCKYOUCANCER
I’ve always thought for the longest time they have always had the cure for cancer but just doesn’t release it
Rest In Peace Kelly Ann stone died Friday 13 /2019 at the age of 50 I miss every day my dear angel

Damn bro preach this shit!!! At least someone is saying it!! I lost my grandma and grandpa to cancer
Wow that’s absolutely amazing man. Thank you Tom the world needed this 🙏
I was just a teen, watching my dad lose his life, not knowing the pain or struggles he went through. He knew he was sick but remained strong for our family til it was to late. I watched as he went from a human to a vase full of ashes in 4 short months. I was 16 then. I don't wish cancer on anyone. I still struggle through day to day tasks, I miss him dearly and thats why I'm quitting the cigarettes. I want to be around for my family. This song touched my heart so deeply. Thank you for writing it tom!
My (probably) future Brother in Law (I'd like to think we're good friends, he isnt really that open) dealt with his mother dying when he was 12. He has had a long, horrible life.
Thank you Nova and Tom.  I just shared this with my local and regional American Cancer Society people...they too need to hear your message in your lyrics. Definitely tears😢 definitely hope✨ definitely faith🙏
My Mom was just diagnosed with Cancer Monday.. she is determined to not take any treatments and she is ready to go,she is 69 years old..but we all ARE NOT ready for that.
My grandfather recently passed on September 16th due to stage four lung cancer
He should win a grammy for this one
They dont cure it because they make more from treatment than from curing it
Wow this one hit me
Imagine knowing when you die.. sleeping for the last time.. that would be the saddest thing ever..
A truth? We created the belief in money and we let it control everyday of our life. We could make the world better, fix a lot of things if money wasn’t a problem. Give everyone money. No more poor. Everyone created equal. But we need a spiritual leader to control the ego, ignorance, and materialism. Everything could be much different
And the cure for cancer is = Figs, Olives, Honey, Blackseed, Water. + Try surviving on that for 6 months straight = bye bye cancer
This hit me and my mom really hard. Her best friend died of colon cancer in June of 2016. I had only been 10, and had always thought of him as a dad. Rest in peace Sir Charles Anthony Royston, aka Pooh.
God made to listen to this. God bless white boy. That doctor sang the song white boy. He looks different. I love your work.
Nothing wrong with him i just hate his rapping voice i like his story telling skills but i would be so annoyed listening for long periods it sounds like a minecraft song
My dad died of   Adrenal cancer in 2018 sucks 😕
WOW. I lost my fiancee in October 2012 to cervical cancer. December 2013 my cousin passed from breast cancer. This is such an amazing song that truly hits home for me.
My Oldest brother died from Kidney Cancer yesterday the day you released this. I couldn’t bring my self to say anything. The words wouldn’t come.  It still doesn’t seem real. I have a niece fighting breast cancer. She won’t give up. Neither will I. Thank you Tom
The cure is coming.  Will they share it, free for everyone? Like the amazing human who made the polio vaccine free for all. Or will they buy the patent and bury it to keep their 100 billion dollar treatment money flowing? Time will tell.

It makes me sad that the Americans go through this. *I practiced as a nurse in Vancouver, Canada* 🇨🇦🍁 for quite a few years, and financial problems never came up. My grandmother was given a $50,000 cardiac implant at no cost, simply because our universal healthcare system could provide that intervention. I feel pride that my country is able provide this opportunity for its citizens and it is my sincerest wish to see this repeat itself in the US in the near future
THX for this 💏🙏
How could 1, much less 1600, people dislike this song?
Great video tom!! This really helps shine the light on the "C" word nobody likes to hear at the doctor. Lost my dad/best friend last year due to pancreas cancer. Upon diagnosis at stage 4 after 5 weeks he was gone. It was so fast saw him go from working and being healthy to very sick and not able to walk or talk. He knew he didnt have long to live once they knew everything and how the cancer was attacking his body that all he said is he wanted to go home and die there so thats what we did and thats where he died in the comforts of home. I hope noone has to loose their dad as fast as i did. It hurts me so bad everyday and every sunday i go to sit and talk to him at his grave. RIP DAD I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
Love much to all who read this.
Yo this hit home bro my mom has lung cancer and I'm definitely gonna show her this song, thanks Tom
Gay
The dislikes are all people trying to shut down tom, or people that love people dying. Everyone truly matters, quit listening to this political crap people. This is the real truth. My mom was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, and my aunt passed away a month ago from stage 4 cancer, and coronavirus. She survived it for 6 months. Strongest woman i know, besides my mother. Men don't ever take your special woman for granted, and woman don't ever take your good men for granted either. We need each other whether we want to believe it or not people.
My father in law passed away 31 Dec 2017..RIP Arno, we miss you so much💖 Thanks Tom for this song! Blessings from The Netherlands👊
What a legend. This is what hip hop needs. Storytelling and meaningful lyrics
This is 🔥🔥 fam 💯💯 keep speakin on what they won’t.
Lost my grandpa last year because to lung cancer. It was hard for everyone in family. Thank you for your music. ❤️ It's a anthem
This was almost cornier than "I'm corny" but I appreciate that you made it about the for profit cancer industry conspiracy. True say, dude.
I've lost several people to cancer I hate it love this song and you brother my mom beat throat cancer only to succumb to brain cancer 11 years later she was tired and sick of fighting I miss her everyday RIP ma I love and miss you
Tom McDonald's music has changed me for life. 🙏🙏 Bless you and your family Tom🤙 Thank you for your 🎶.
as survivor this song really hits home and hard..i have a saying i survived cancer in america without health isurance is that winning the lottery?
🧡 nice voice
I’m all about making $$ but when that desire to get wealthy means people like my grandpa get to die a slow miserable death and get told they will die if they try anything other than the mainstream BS I’m not with it. There’s some real good documentary’s about how corrupt cancer research funding is. They have insanely high “overhead,” so usually only 1% goes to funding research. They’ve even found funding drives were NONE of the $$ went to research. Of course that got hurriedly swept under the rug. I’m digging up all the info I can and I’ll be making a well edited video on it. Subject I’m greatly interested in. I lost my grandpa 9 years ago. He was my best friend. I will never forgive his doctors who used the law to prevent him from leaving the hospital and trying other methods. He had more $$ than god. He could have tried anything. Fuck em. Let’s do what our parents failed to do. Let’s find the cure that’s likely already out there. And find a way to make it affordable and profitable for the company who discovers it. So they can have money to cure the next “incurable” disease
Your the best Tom 🖕🖕 all the haters they hate the truth and being wrong! Keep proving them wrong they pay the bills at the end of the day, people so stupid they dont even know it hahaha. Keep it up Tom the world needs you right now fam!!      HOG FOR LIFE 🤙🤙🤙
You are really a grate artist from one of you biggest fans in South Africa my brother. Every song you drop just hits us in the hart. Thank for not selling out to Corp and keep doing what you are doing. You inspire alot of people around the world and believe me you are making more of an impact than you know.
Lost my mother-in-law this year, my mom is going through it right now and my step-dad is on hospice. Fuck cancer!
You are a inspiration ❤️ .
Can’t tell if this is like serious or like some kind of parody/satire.
This song hit hard man I lost my mama 3 yrs ago to stage 4 terminal cancer great song man!
To my sister who is sick, you are a fighter 💪
The best treatment for cancer is fasting, while on a carnivore diet. Our bodies were never meant to process food 3 times a day or more, we are suppose to go a day or two without food. Not to mention all the junk we eat and bad habits that speed up the cancer growth.  If you go on an extended fast, the body will attack the cancer cells once it has cleansed itself of all the garbage "fuel" we put in us.  When you break the fast, go back to eating only real meat. Fish, Beef, Chicken, Deer are ideal. This will stabilize and rebuild you. Do not listen to the masses.
We have a cure for cancer, but the government won’t release it because they make too much money treating it.
If you disliked this you have no soul and you are just a mean human a deserve to go to hell not trying to be mean or anything but that's what I feel
RIP mum 🌹🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧🇨🇦🇺🇸
Tom, THANK YOU so much for this song!! I honestly brought me to tears. I sent my best friend this song as soon as it dropped. He listens to the song and tells me I have some news. My dad has stage 3 colon cancer. I had no idea he would say that. His dad is like my dad, this song at first brought me to tears because while it’s about cancer I took it as an anthem for mental strength but now it’s a song I listen to to keep my second dad in my prayers and in my thoughts! Thank you Tom
This is just as powerful.Should be shared worldwide. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34hJd2uagWY
Thank you for this vid bro appreciate you
Thank you for doing this video. I've lost so many family members to Cancer and it never gets easier. I have dreams about my aunt and uncle and great grandparents almost every single night. They don't say anything but surround me bathed in white light. They are at peace but it still doesn't take the pain I still feel away. Sending love from Kentucky.
I lost my mom back in May 2019 from breast cancer that spread and turned to lung cancer. I was 20 at the time, and my mom was my best friend. I was fortunate enough to have a good relationship with her, and having to witness and watch her die right in front of me at the hospital still leaves me sleepless some nights. I miss her so much, and the grieving still doesn't end. But I found routes to take like making music myself to cope with it. What I'm saying is, cancer is a nasty thing. Be sure not to take advantage of your loved ones, because you never know what tomorrow can bring. I love you mom, rest in peace. And thank you Tom for this song, it really hit home for me and helped me bring out some emotions I had bottled up for a while.
My mother will likely die from cancer....when she does go, so will I.
Thank you for this man I lost my cousin 4 days after her 15th birthday she'd be 17 now so this hits very close to home and I pray that one day a cure will be released so that no one has to go through the pain of losing their mothers father's sisters and brothers anymore from this horrible disease
100% Truth
Thank you for this. My father passed from a rare form of brain cancer they didn't find til after he passed. I was only 8 months old. I had a pre cancer scare after my 2 oldest daughters were born.  My whole life without him. Thank you for this song and video.
I feel this song, my dad went from being one of the strongest people I knew to being in a wheelchair and then gone 5 months after his diagnosis
It’s Sad to hear he doesn’t know where he will go when he dies 💔
Love it. This whole album is amazing. Thank you Tom for sharing your Heart!
Just found out my grandpas cancer came back. This hits so hard 😭
Tom McDonald , Adam Calhoun and Jelly Roll need to Collaborate!! Fareal

Man you are real. Dont listen to the haters. Keep them going and give hope
Thank you Tom for this song. Reminds me of the fight my dad went though with stage 3 colon cancer. He beat it and has been cancer free for 2 years now.
Damn bro you did it again! Just lost my dad 2 months ago to cancer! Just fkin balled my eyes out! Your songs nail what I'm going through an how I feel! Keep up the great work my brother!!
Theres got to be cures but just trying pays more...idk
Great song love that you sing about real problems in the world today
Omg I can't stop crying
Lost my grandparents to cancer and one cousin. Two of my cats also passed due to cancer. Fuck cancer! Two months ago I lost yet one cat to cancer. Wtf?
They won't cure it cause it's life and if we was able to cure all of our problems then the world would be shit. It's part of life and keeps the numbers down. Imagine everyone never getting sick, never dying off and imagine the shit we would be in. Everything happens for a reason and there might not even be a cure. Some things just can't fixed, that's the way of life
Best song ever man !!! Deep Facts
My mother faught for a year with acute myloid leukemia and even after treatments and bone marrow transplant she still died. All the suffering she went through for nothing. but another year to live in pain and even more suffering. This song brought tears.
Your the best
"You don't know what you can take, till  you realize you didn't break" Deep shit. The whole thing is refreshingly direct, not an artistic interpretation of a train of thought, just a train of thought. I'm getting more and more impressed with Mr. MacDonald.
🙏❤🔥
Respect ✊
Are you sure you're rapper? I thought you aren't  , I'm sorry guys maybe I like others type of songs
This song makes me think of my grandma and grandpa witch both have lung cancer. And yes tom we do pay to kill our selfs. You keep spreading the truth thats why we love you
This touch my soul....
Thank you for this song!! Stay strong everyone!
One of my classmates had testicular cancer. He was only in stage 1 and he had surgery to get it all out. Next thing he knows, the cancer spread to his lungs, heart, and all over his chest and now he is in stage 3. He is 17 and doing Chemo now.
I had cancer for 3 years. I had leukemia i was told i will die by the doctors but i fighted and fighted i came thru now i am 2 years remission i am glad god was by my side. Great fight anthem Tom MacDonald
Do your research cancer is curable I'm not saying this from ignorants but years of research
I had ovarian cancer. They told me I would never have kids, that I would have to get everything removed. I couldn't afford it, my insurance wouldn't cover it. I dealt with the sickness and the pain for years. And now, it's in remission, and I have two sons ages 13 and 2. completely!
My aunt has cancer
so corny
These testimonials are beautiful. Every. Single. One.      💫
They'll never find a cure and if they already have done or will do only the privilege will get the cure
The cure is plant based!! Big pharmacy knows it and so does the government! They don't want you going to Colorado  to get cured cuz they lose $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
I’m very proud of you this is without a doubt your masterpiece
Thank you.
We say what we do due to personal views. You've gained another follower. Keep speaking the truth. 👊
"When you are down and if you need someone,Jesus is a true friend"🙏👑❤️😇
rofl this is terrible
Infect me with the sickness and deny me any surgery. That's all I left my mom go to the doctors greed you'll find #cancer I could have just had her smoking weed now these days they're saying that's all we need thank you brother for the song it really don't miss me. Godspeed
I believe they have a cure. This song is nothing but facts. Cancer is a money making machine. They also have a vaccine for this coronavirus. We are all being played by our evil government who is controlled by the 1%.
Wtf with these lyrics. Damn this is surprisingly good. To all those cancer patients out there, never stop believing. You're survivor and you're strong!
Tom macdonald is the greatest musician alive, maybe even history. Not only does he have skill, it sounds great and catchy, but he makes music about the realest shit ever. And his music wakes people and makes people aware of the hidden agendas. Thank you Tom!
My mom's MRI is this Monday, please pray for us or send good vibes. This song dropped at the perfect time and I can't stop crying
I had Cancer, Neuroblastoma and Askins Tumor......Childhood Cancer.....
Rest assured if you have faith in Jesus there is a place far greater than here, point your loved ones to Jesus and we will all be together with God in Heaven for eternity.
Love the passion in this song! God bless you tom
“Thanks for this anthem” bro the songs not even good
I was not ready for that, good stuff Tom. Keep it up.
Something different and its amazing.
Wow.. I have no words just streaming tears... absolute 🔥🔥🔥
I literally cried watching this
Love it tom, u r touching so many peoples lives. We love u tom. Keep going strong.
Tom MacDonald = Facts
I have an aunt who is a two time cancer survivor and lost my mom to cancer, SCREW CANCER
This song really got to me. I lost my grandma to cancer and almost lost 2 of my aunts as well.  I had ovation cancer when i was younger and was told I'd never have kids. Now here I am wib a beautiful 2 year old . I got pregnant the day I i spread my moms ashes. I believe she sent her to me to keep me alive..   Another amazing song. Your music helps so many people through so much. Never stop being you . Your truly amazing
This is grate keep spreading truths
Damn this really hits home Tom thank you for putting this out there is so many people fighting for their lives and they Just don’t wanna hurt no more and be happy with their families 😔 😔 😔 😢
Lost my dad to kidney cancer in 1990. He was only 45. He passed Nov 5th and his birthday is Nov 28th. This hit close to home. Have tears in my eyes writing this. Thank you Tom for this song.
Chemotherapy is not a cure. It can not be healthy if you lose the hair and vomit for weeks. It is only a money machine.
I just lost my mom to bladder cancer. It sucks.. I miss her SO much.!
My cousin's 11 year old daughter and my friend's 13 year old son were both just diagnosed with cancer. This song really hit home!
Tom really hit it on this one. I don't listen to his music but the dudes genuine.  Good drop bro, good vibes.
I assume those that dislike the video or the song they don't like you so that tells me they are just trolls. For those 1.5k listen to your Jennifer Lopez and her shitty music.
This is so beautiful, hes sending a message while shining hope to people who have cancer. Thank you Tom
Another awesome song thank you time and it did make me cry to my mom died of cancer
The tears keep flowing as I continue to listen . You are so wise my dear friend. Keep fighting everyone and I'm praying for all of US 🙏
This one hit home as I've lost so many family and friends to this.. thank you for sharing. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
1.5k dislikes....hmm 🤔 is there that many pharmaceutical company board members and CEO's?
They have the cure the just make more money  of the medicine and therapy

Good might go to heaven, bad might go to hell... but nobody wants to leave here, you can tell... race, politics, religion, etc aside, that’s facts.
6 On trennndangggg 🤙🏼
Cancer can't take one ounce of what makes you who and what you are!! I love this song. Thanks, Tom.
Cancer is a parasite
i don’t even listen to your music man but thanks for making a song to empower the people going through this. i hope that when i graduate med school i can help everyone fight this ❤️
Hits too close to home. But thank you though.
I lost the best person in my life from cancer January 24th, 2020. Crazy that this was just released... tomorrow would've been her 78th birthday. I bawled listening to it.  By the time they caught the cancer, I feel it was too late for treatment. But she was talked into it anyway. The chemo was $30k per round (one month). She did one round... the side effects were so bad that it made it where she couldn't eat, talk or sleep. She was in so much pain. She started the second round and got just a couple days into before being admitted to the hospital where she then was put on hospice.. after arriving at home with her family by her side, she lived just a few more days. I had the honor of dressing her up alongside my sister. We did her hair and make-up just the way she always did it and made sure she looked like the angel she was.  I miss my granny so much.
Cancer sucks i am a survivor myself. I remember the day I found out. Its been 22 years now. It still haunts me every day
This song is great Tom. I remember the stories my older sister had of her friends she made and lost when she was fighting her cancer. Hopefully this gives people strength. If anyone reading has cancer. You can get better. Don't give up. The world is waiting for you.
I just found out because of my twin pregnancy where one turned into a tumor. I will have to undergo chemo after I have the other baby. If she's even born alive. I never thought it would be me, but here we are. Scared of what's to come, but ill do anything for my baby. Thank you for this Tom
FAVORITE ROLE MODEL?
So Tom i listen to all your music all the time not a single song as been bad in my opinion ever the ones that make you laugh, make you think, and make you hurt. All have meaning and all come from your heart no one else's. That takes a man of much power to create what you have. And I find my self wondering what it would be like to spend just a little bit of time hearing the voices in you head and conversation with a man who has what seems to be one of the most diverse minds in the music world. But as I am adopted and my biological mother passed from cancer when I was 16 I didnt think much of it, but my adoptive family which has made me whole in a lost world now faces it my father is fighting bladder cancer and my mother has been on the down hill slope from breast cancer that spread in her lymphatic system. As the last few years have gone she will lose track of what she's doing where she is and who I am sometimes. She will talk to me about people we went to school with even tho I am her son I see her losing her self slowly and eventually the family I have left will be gone and ill be a empty vessel running on auto pilot. With that being said I know that truthfully out of all the fans you have my message will never be read by you which is totally okay 👌.  And im sure I will get alot of negative feed back on my comment too. But I have found that I can't bring my self to listen to this song yet I get a few seconds in and I have to stop it. For this im sorry. I'm sure its great but I feel like it will hit at home to hard for me at this time. But I thank you for hitting this topic it makes you more real than a face on the screen or a voice thru my speakers.
One of your best songs!!
Love this Video. Med beds will be out next year !
My grandma had lung cancer 7 years ago and had to have a lung removed. When she left the hospital the Dr told us she had probably around 2 weeks to live. I had to carry her into the house when we got back and I honestly broke down from seeing her so weak. Well I am happy and proud to say that I just got through eating lunch with her the other day she fought it off and still fights it off to this day she is cancer free and my inspiration.

Love ya tom
this is the best music song ever  in our entire
Hi tom macdonald. I like your new music video it was lit. 🔥
You're doing God's work. Things like this take massive balls to talk about, let alone write songs about it. You're using your platform for noble reasons, and I will always respect you for that. Thank you, once again.
🤦‍♂️ Only this dude could take something so positive and make it so cringe. Regardless much love and respect still goes out to everyone fighting cancer.
Is Blink 182 on this track?
U are so right, Bravo thank u for making this love your music
This fuckinh clown actually makes so much sense I can't even take it
Lost my mommy to colon cancer may 2015 ... miss you mommy .. thanks Tom ... I’m crying
You made me cry again
Tom this so relates to me my step mom died of terminal cancer really broke me this year and the end of life team was on her 24 7 then ended up after she was tested negative for covid 19 put down on her certificate covid 19 we had months to prepare for this after her radio therapy but it hurt bad when I got the call her life support was turned of and I was miles away couldn't even say goodbye either...
Wow such a powerful song it really touched my heart thank you for a great song and keep em coming.
😭🙏🏼
I lost my oldest sister september 2019 after she battle cancer for almost 3 years and ive never seen anyone so strong and brave right to the end so this song means alot to me and many others so thanks tom and keep makeing positive inspireing music we will b waiting and listening
THANK YOU
Cancer is mutated cells.  What is mutating our cells?
My mom died of advanced cancer back in August, and this song just made me bawl and bawl 😭😭
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💖💖💖💖💖 Bawling my eyes out omgosh.  R.I.P Mama  Prayers for anyone going through this right now. Thank you for making this come out
WOW thank you for this, this one hits home lost my older brother to the "C" word!
Fuck yeah man love the song
Man just wow just an amazing song I lost my dad to liver cancer before I was even a year old
Weed is the answer...
Lost both my grandparents to this damn illness. Never got to meet my dads mom. Then lost his father when I was 7. I don’t know how he handled it.  Then my brother got it. He’s going strong! 8 years in remission! 💪💪❤️❤️
sad that we are treated like a product. Medical makes more money off our death than our survival.
Thank you Tom !!!
Thank you Tom for your words and music!!! I love you brother!! My mom and I were talking the other day and she said something similar to your quote “money doesn’t mean anything if you don’t have your health”. She said “there’s one thing that money can’t buy and that’s health. We have to take care of ourselves for our loved ones”. It’s not coincidence that I’ve heard those words from two different people at two different times, that’s the universe speaking to me. I have a four year old daughter that depends on me so those words that you and my mom said have sank in deep with me.
My mom has cancer and this song really touches me man, thank you for such a wonderful song.
I love the song and i love the message, this video should have 0 and i mean ZERO dislikes! Weather u dont like the vid or its not the music you like....none of that matters. The message alone is all the reason you need to like this song! #fuckcancer
My grandma had breast cancer and made it through it! Stay strong! Don’t give up!
Love the hater!..lmao!!.. the lovers will always win!
Love music with a message
Thank you very much for that one! Like a lot of people I’ve lost family to this stupid disease called cancer. I needed that.
My daddy died of Cancer rest in peace pap
That hit me right in the heart
It been 10 months since I had my oldest sons dad die in my lap at 45 years young . Thank u for this song I dont think I stopped crying through the whole song
listening from gosford hospital australia surgery ward. 😓..
What an amazing song this is.
Thank you for this! My mom has lung cancer and is in the fight for her life. This is uplifting!
Beautiful just beautiful.
When you die, you go in a hole.
Damn Tom. Well done
🙌👏 Dude is always on fire!!! One of the best artist out there!
Absolutely incredible. Thankyou Tom!!!!
I'm adding this to my playlist, I was waiting for you to add it to youtube. It's one of my favorite songs from your cds
they will never cure cancer it is making big pharma billions and billions every year. I lost my dad and step dad to cancer
My gma passed from cancer and she was my rock I don’t really like your music tbh but this song I felt thanks 🙏
This song is very deep. Thank you for spreading hope.
❤️❤️
Sooooo...socialized medicine, anyone?
Two weeks ago my beautiful 6 year old German Shepherd Riddick was diagnosed with lymphoma. We start treatment tomorrow. Thank you, I needed this. He may not be human but hes our baby.
This song hit me in the heart. My mom died of cancer 4 years ago and I held her til she took her last breath. Thank you for this. It helps the healing. ❤️
This hit me so hard. I lost my grandmother recently to cancer and my father a few years ago. This song hits that feeling straight on.
This is the real disease! People pumping COVID FEAR PORN should be ashamed of themselves!
im not crying you are 😂
)]rl1
This song is so full of love and passion. An anthem as well as a truth. Your voice is used so well for the truth and betterment of humanity. I love your light.  💟☮️☯️💟
Masks destroy the brain and nervous system. Covid 19 is a solvent made by your own body as a result of 5G radiation. Masks do not prevent radiation, other tools do however. Do not wear masks. Do not kill yourself for anyone.
You got talent dude, from Canada 🇨🇦 Vancouver British Columbia
You’re going to be hated bro, the realist always are! ✊🏽🖕🏼the establishment!
God bless you and your family. Cancer sucks id give my life today if it meant a cure.
I miss your old raps. This music nowadays from you isn’t the Tom McDonald I feel love with
great song, but that bald cap looks so bad lol
Damn tom...this is some serious shit n hits home really hard..had a uncle,aunt,my dad(rip) n my mom has it too..so many tears have been shed thru this disease nits sad.damn tom you made me cry today n that's not easy...you're a real emcee n one of the realist rappers I've ever heard..wish I would've discovered you earlier..but I hope I can speak for most when I say..you've touched many hearts and minds with you're lyrics,don't ever stop cause of the industry or cause ppl don't like how real some rappers are...to me there's very few artists who can do this with such drive and motivation....now we just need to motivate the rest of the world..one love tom, n if they ever ban you from TV...well you got plenty of fans..we'll do backyard shows cause this man needs to b heard..thank you for the some of the dopest music I've heard...hope all has a good day n nothing but love for all.
I'm not crying , you are.
We are the commodity to big government and big pharma. Just look at the family court system, they favor women and fuck dudes over to fund title IV-D. It’s the same thing, they could fix the family court system and help the kids, but they would rather make money.
Who the hell are the 1400 that thumbs downed this.. yall some busters and i hope you catch your pinkytoe on a bed rail 💯💯 this shit is fire thank you Tom
😮
Yeah cancer is suprisingly common isnt it. Learned that like two months ago when i got diagnosed with a brain tumor. Shit is wild. This song is kinda corny tho.
Right on my brother still wiping my eyes much love god bless all who suffer from this horrible thing thank you for sharing
Can't even express how much I needed to hear this. Thank you
We just lost my girlfriend's mom 2 days ago. I'm balling, and I listened a few times. Ty great one
As a kid I watched my mom deal with cancer till the day she passed. It’s my biggest fear. Weather it be me, my wife or either of my girls. I remember my father working nonstop to cover the bills. My heart goes out there to all those who’s life has been impacted by cancer. Fuck cancer!
Great...just 👍 Eminem is a legend...Tom is is a Luminary Phenomenon
You hit it out of the park with this one. I freaking hate cancer. I lost my dad to cancer. My wife lost her grandmother to cancer. There should be a cure for it by now.
It would be cured if Tom Macdonald stopped rapping
Me and my family lost five people  in the last 8years because of cancer..this shit is damn hard. I hope y'all healthy and will life a good live ❤
Isn't this the guy who made Ram Ranch?
I'm watching this right now and Tom, it is hitting home for so many reasons. I had a friend who died of ovarian cancer that might not have killed her if they had re-examined her as she requested after her hysterectomy to remove cervical cancer. By the time she got a second opinion, it was too late. She was in late stage cancer and died within 6 months after radiation and chemo. I had a scare with my own health.  Too much to get into here. Had I kniwn then what I  Know now,  I would've urged her to try other treatments.
2 Very Beautiful Women in My Life Lost their Fight to Cancer! They Were the Most Beautiful People, Loving, Caring, Understanding! Its Always the Best Of Us That Get Dealt the Worst Hands In Life! This Hit Very Hard In All The Right Places! Thank You Tom!
1.4 thousand dislikes? Just shows how bad we humans can be. We would rather dislike a song than show support for something we should all be fighting together. We can’t get past the hate.
Wtf is going on with the forehead makeup good song sad shit or not thsts awful editing jesus christ
Tom Macdonald is one of the realest rapper's today, one more thing... F@CK Cancer.
Wish I could send this to my uncle. He died from Pancreatic Cancer a year ago. He got diagnosed and only lived 4 months after that....now both my parents have just been diagnosed in the last month...thanks for this. I'll be showing them.
Man! My wife had me watch Clouds last night and now seeing this today. My emotions are all over the place. You are special Tom. You always bring a message.
There’s no cure because you need to kill CELLS the problem is killing the cancer cells and not the normal cells,in a lab water can kill cancer but it’s not simple inside your body
Beautiful ❤🙏🙏
You can see the importance of this topic in his eyes in the video. Much love Tom. Prayers and power to those suffering or know people who are
You’re the softest rapper ever. Quit capitalizing off cancer bro. Lame.
Watched family and friends go thru treatments after being told they have cancer. Thanks for putting this out. Thanks for being an independent artist who puts the truth to music
my dad had cancer he lived all though he lost one of his balls to it but he did that so he could live so thank you tom for making this song                       legends never really die
Wow.... emotional.
I miss you mom. That's all I have to say.
I lost my mom to stage 4 metastatic breast cancer in 2016.
Tom was right when he talked about this new video
Too many have fought and died. Dude once again you put out some great music and you speak about real issues! Keep driving the change for this country! Fire as always!
I think this is what rap was supposed to be
This made me wanna cry I hope you make more like these ... someone with a voice (and a bright mind) with a audience saying what the voiceless have been trying to scream
Definitely a great song
Why won't this video play?🤬
Perfect lyrics, top to bottom.
Ooof...... you said we would cry..... beautiful song
I love how demi lavato song is #23 but this song which actually gives the feels is #6
A lot of my family has had cancer some won some lost this song is beyond amazing
You get me everytime with your music Tom, but this one got me to tears. Cancer has gone through my family a couple times. God willing it will not come back, but if it does, we now have this awesome song to help get us through again.You are truly an amazing artist, and Nova is wonderful at what she does at well. I love all of your messages, and I love that my daughter looks up to you. Thank you for everything you guys do! Great video this week! As always! -Amanda
My mom died of ovarian cancer October 31st 2019, her sister- my aunt died of a rare form of mucus cancer in 2016. My aunts battle was 8 yrs, my moms was 3weeks. Her doctors kept running test after test and never could find out what was wrong with her until it was too late. It was miserable.
And they call this guy corny
Cant wait to see vids for track 15 and icon. Icon will break records.
Loved it brother keep it up
God bless bro your helping a lot of people who are dealing with cancer
For the people who dislike this song should wake up! My wife has stage 4 colon cancer and you won't know what she's going thru until one day it could be you!
Lost both parents to cancer
My mom just passed in Dec.  I have the same gene mutation she had giving me a 65-70% chance of getting breasts cancer. Hoping to have preventative surgery soon.  Thank you  ❤
Touching! Powerful!
This is a powerful song
I like the song. I'm a big fan of you man. I feel like though, you could've made this a lot more passionate though. It could've had so much more elevation to the meaning. All critiques aside, I did enjoy it still. Keep it up man, I'll always be a loyal fan through thick and thin. ✌️☺️
The only cancer is this guy's face tattoo's
Well done Tom very kind song and this world needs it
Damn this is hard 🔥🔥🔥 he is helping alot specially this hard times
Two weeks ago I lost Ms. Beatrice, my Landseer Newfoundland dog to what we believe was cancer. It all happened to fast.  She was bleeding from her mouth and her nose.  We took her in for blood tests, and she had low platelets, which is usually a sign of cancer. She was scheduled for an xray to confirm in 2 more days.  On the night before that appointment she began crying in the night, and around 4am she was no longer breathing.  It happened so, so fast.  It turns out she had lost over 20 pounds in one month, but we didn't notice because she had just been groomed, and it just looked like lost fur.  She always looked skinny after being groomed because she's a long hair breed.  The very worse part is that she died at home.  In the past, all my pets got to the point where they couldn't walk anymore and we'd take them in to be put down.  Never dealt with a pet dying at home.  I had to help my dad carry her to his truck, and we took her to a family members farm to burry her next to my previous dog Buehler. I feel so bad we didn't notice anything sooner.  We had her for 8 great years (usual lifespan for large dogs is 8-10 years), and thought we had another good year left. I know this isn't quite the same as losing a person, or watching a loved one go through the treatments.  But it sucked so bad.
Damn
The left me in tears my mom died from cancer in 2014😭
Beautiful work brother. God bless you Tom. This isn’t music, this is art.
You might be an ugly sob but you have a beautiful heart!
Thank you Tom...... I’ve lost 8 friends in the last year . The most recent was my 43 y/o son in law with 4 kids.  When does it end ???? 😢❤️🤧
Fire !
This hits home.  Lost my wife 5 years ago to cancer. Feb 2nd 2015 she was diagnosed.  She left this world May 15th 2015. I had lost many other prior to that.  I thought I could handle the fight. I was wrong. By far the hardest thing I ever gone through. Thank you Tom for making music that matters. And thank you Nova for everything you do. You guys are awesome. Much love from you HOG fam in Minnesota
Rap is a powerful tool... provided, it is handled by a generous person!
The day this video dropped the day that I found out my husband's cancer free
Tom is the definition of a true activist being politically incorrect in so much of his music. God bless you brother.
Thank you Tom and Nova. This video hits home for so many including myself. What's crazy is everyone knows the cure is real, they just won't give it to the people because that's how they make their money. The bills for radiation, chemo, hospital stays, caregiver cost etc. But the families of the people who are fighting the battle are suffering as well. In other countries when a person gets sick, they don't have to pay until they're better. Out government have it all backwards. But again thank you guys so much for this video.
This is a powerful song and everyone can relate to this in some way
Unreal again man, hope who ever needs to hear this does 🤙
Thank you my guy your words are wisdom and full of your heart and soul and I feel it in every song!  Thank you Nova for the videos that always seem to amaze me. You two are a powerful duo. Thank you both for continuous great content.  #fanforlife.
And it’s the stupid MFs that say he’s trash
Hello "DON'T GIVE UP" Beautiful song❤️🙏
i love this ,man xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Hey Brother, we all have the cancer, mine is toxic relationships, an heavy usage. But I thank you  very much for new direction to say Fuck all the bullshyt, Much Love fam!
Respect level infinite
Man this hits hard. My had cancer and beat it , but my dad lost five sisters in two years and at least three brothers. And when my dad passed away he had throat cancer. Je didn't die from it. The doctors killed him but thats another story . Thanks.
Ok im crying. This is gonna be one of faves forever. Thank you so much for sharing your talent and nova for her amazing talent as well. Yall are unstoppable :)
not your usual video Tom, but i love it!! I think i know someone in every family that i know of that has in some way been effected by Cancer. i hate it. Thank you. we are fighters!!
Over a decade ago, I started questioning the truth behind the pink ribbons. Question. Everything. Always.
Trash.
My mother got cancer when i was 8, and she's still deals with the struggles of recovery. After that i deemed that i would never listen to a tom macdonald song so i wouldn't suffer the same fate
Man some of these story I feel greatly uplifting n sad great song
Awesome , you cover some of the most unspeakable topics so well!!!! Thanks Brother
Great Song Great Message 💯💪🙏🙏🙏 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Ayo TOM MACDONALD... YOUR STRAIGHT UP A LIVING LEGEND , and that's a Fact. Much RESPECT MY MAN, Greatly Talented, and FOR THE PEOPLE 💯💪👍✌️ Keep Up the Great Work, it's just keeps getting better and better, ONE LOVE HOMIE ✌️✌️✌️🔥
As soon as you said sad in your video about new video I knew it was cancer love this song you the man tom mcdonald another song of truth keep up the good work
Ayo I had a cancerous tumor on my brain and I've never seen this dude before, but the lines "you can't experience strength till you struggle to carry the weight/you won't know why you have faith till you look the devil in the face" really hit different when I remember those days going through chemo and radiation. To any people fighting cancer still keep going because the ability to smile in the devil's face is worth every second of it.
Lordy Tom, you made me cry with this one. Awesome as always
Life is never guaranteed for any length of time so make the best of everyday ... Don't wait for the tragedies in life to start living life when that life might be over within that hour!
The end is no longer near; the end is now HERE!  Tomorrow may be too late for you; no one is guaranteed tomorrow. We are all sinners and the wages of sin is eternal death in hell! REPENT and ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST as your saviour today in 3 simple steps  A - Accept that you are a sinner in need of a saviour B - Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, died and shed his blood for our sins, buried, resurrected on the third day, ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God C - Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is lord of your life.
Just like civid 19 if you think about it
Bro Tom thank you for this song. It hit home for me I lost my grandfather to the C and its been harder for me to take it on one end I was the rock my family needed but on the other to myself I feel apart. So thank you this im sure is something alot of us needed and could use. Keep up the amazing work 👏 👍
Amazing bro...fuckin truth,  they make to much money treating so they won't release the cure..  I watched cancer eat my brother to the bone, he pushed for 3 years in stage 4 and finally couldn't take no more,  he passed away 3 yrs ago.. This song hit me hard...
This guy is nothing like rappers today, he makes sense he raps/sings about the reality. Tom you the GOAT Brodie keep up the great work and keep bringing the 🔥🔥🔥🔥 love your music
Thank you for rapping The Truth.
Damn right in the feels with this one Tom!
I had a brain cancer (tumour) and I finished chemo in feb 2020. They initially offered two years of intensive treatment and I didn’t accept. So we waited and exactly a year later, the tumour grew back and in one year, the treatment plan reduced from 2 years to 7 months!!! And now I’m remission!! Love this video though, it’s amazing!!!
All these down likes are from Big Pharm.
The love of my life was just diagnosed with AML in July. I needed this.
Ok cancer is big so they are doing good keeping people from diying
Thank you for making this song I just lost my father last sept to cancer. I really hate that so many people have to go through this shit everyday because the people who are supposed to help us would rather line their pockets than actually help people.
It's all just a test, when someone dies the living are being tested. The Dead's test is done. Peace be upon them all.
Thank you
It’s the medical industry, they’re making money off of you being sick. We literally donate so much money to research for so many years and yet they haven’t gotten anywhere.
I hate Cancer cause I lost my Grandma January 16, 2019 and lost my aunty in September 13, 2019 and I'm afraid to anyone else I've had bad years In my life so you all need to be with your love ones before it's too late Never Give Up on them, stay strong y'all
I love this song! I’m going to play this for my mom who has been fighting breast cancer for about ten years, she is the most amazing woman I’ve ever known. Thank you!
cancer is not actually in our genetics...maybe now it is cuz of all the years of putting in bad shit but cancer comes form poor diet and life choices eat green and stay away from processed foods... its so crazy to me that all the brands using the pink ribbon for breast cancer have so many cancer causing ingredients... pointing to you frozen foods
Tom Macdonald  there are many cures for cancer. unprofitable, natural,  too simple thus theyre suppressed. Apricot seeds, dandelion roots all one need do is to ingest. Naturally our body naturally in equilibrium will correct and conquest. Grounding is also magical, healing, a much needed connection to the rest. We’ve all been cut off and knocked out of balance, stumbling falling from the beam. all can be will be better. its more than just a dream.
Just lost my father Tuesday from pancreatic cancer...thank you for this.
🙏
Damn you, Tom, I thought u were kidding when u said we'd cry.!
I lost my best friend to lymphoma in 2009. He was 28
This hit me hard 🥺😭😭 my mom and dad aunts and uncles that word is an abolishment to human souls who suffer and agonizing torturing of a human life
Thank you man 🙏🏽
This song is so good  I love it
Man sent a diss track to cancer
I lost my father to cancer in 2015. I think of him everyday. Even though we wasnt close towards the last few years he was alive he will forever be in my heart. Thank you Tom Macdonald. Good song. Speak brother!! #FUCKCANCER.
Since 2015 I have lost my grandma, mom, and dad to cancer. This was a hard one to watch.

Thank you Tom!
dislikes coming from tobacco alcohol and chemical factories owners .
Blaring through town , teary eyed
MED BEDS COMING SOON !!!
Amen Brother...... ❤
Made me cry
this dudes so bad it’s unbelievable
Thanks I cant stop crying now
I've lost too many people to cancer, including my dad this year and I just turned 25 without him. But I'm getting through it with the help of great music, this song slaps and truly nails it on the message. Much fucking love Tom keep it up bro ✌💜😊 (Huge fan from Nebraska baby)
Amazing song and what a powerful message 🔥🔥🔥
This means a lot my best friend died from cancer and I miss her everyday 😥❤️
Damn Tom, trying to hold back the tears. Great song
Is this the guy making all that money from conservatives by pandering to them?
the chorus is fucking laughable. how can people actually listen to this
My mom has had cancer twice Leukemia and skin cancer and genetically I can get skin cancer to so I look at the world different from other people cause I can't be out in the sun so much cause of the radiation from it so I know the fear people have that have cancer.
This is disrespectful
Trying to share and YouTube says I've reached my limit...... wtf
Thank you for this Tom. My Mom and Aunt are cancer survivors. My grandfather on my father's side did not survive it though.
lmao his logic is so dumb. Blaming doctors for not funding a cure when its a 100b industry. smh
Just lost our grandma to brain swelling .... she beat breast cancer.... I haven’t cried about it yet oh guess it hasn’t fully hit me .... this one almost made me cry . 😎 but I didn’t
Great song made me cry and I never do!!! Shout out from Vermont!!!!!
This man has a heart that can be heart around the world. Thank you Nova and Tom very inspiring.
I was diagnosed with a rare and fatal cancer 2wks after my 4th birthday. At that time there were no survivors. This was in 1984 and treatment was so toxic and being a small child it was even harder. I spent 4 and a half years in U of M hospital only being allowed to go home for visits twice a month. I was lonely and had little to no visitors including my own mother who was in the beginning stages of her addiction.  I spent alot of time with volunteers known at that time as candystripers. I went through chemotherapy alone, radiation alone and many many surgeries alone. I had beautiful lond curly hair that fell out on my 5th birthday and I was so upset cause I  didnt understand. I beat that cancer as a medical miracle at that time in 1990 with no amputations either. I AM A SURVIVOR!!! I continue to do medical updated surveys to let the medical community know how i am doing and how my health is after all the experimental treatments I was forced to endure, along with contracting Hepatitis C through a blood transfusion
Cancer is more than just the "C" word. The effect of cancer affects everyone. This song is more than words, it is an anthem.
🙏🏽
Garbage as per usual. Keep it up Tom!
Such a powerful song, anyone who has gone through this can relate. Love you Tom and Nova, just keep doing you.
🖕
You are truly the best artist in the world sir. Thank you for doing you.
OMG—Tom you aren’t a rapper—you have a special gift—no matter the topic or how sad the lyrics are—I’ll be crying listening to some of your tracks but I always feel better! Thank You for all you do and please never stop touching lives with your gift—you never cease to amaze me!
My God so many tears. My Aunt was in remission but recently had another biopsy done, when called she was told she had to come back to the office to get the results.   Cancer doesn't discriminate, it takes who it wants when it wants them. Enough is enough!
lyric were amazing, keep it up im tired to see ass money car rap
Wow... great job tom..
This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. They already have a cure? No.
I always knew that if they did RELEASE a cure for cancer that would mean ALLOT of money lost. Like ALLOT
This song speaks volumes
Cancer has taken so many family members and friends from me.
👄🍻Wow just fucking Wow Tom.... Cancer is the real pandemic!! There isn't a vaccine for Cancer coz the cancer society makes too much money off of our loved ones dying 🤧....Thx Tom for another awesome truth telling tune....🇨🇦❤🎼🎶
wow totally need to hear this today i survived 2 cancer and still standing tall and proud battling my 3rd diagnostic within 3 years  FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART THANK YOU
Thank you for this song,I've had too many pass from cancer,including my mother😥😥😥😥
My dad had cancer he still here he beat it
I’m waiting for *Fantano* to tear apart Cancer.
They’ve a cure for all cancer but they make more money treating the disease then curing it that’s the sick truth
✊✊✊ together
He has a good point all this money for no cure 🤷🏽‍♂️🤨
I wish I could like this 1 million times!!
My mother died of cancer and this video touched my heart thank you

Amazing.
I’m An Artist With The Worse Case Of Crohn’s Disease That Can One Day Turn Into Stomach Cancer In The Future, So I Relate To This Song Hard  🙏
This guy cant write a good hook for shit.
One of my good friends has cancer and has been fighting it for the past 10 years she's... She is hands down the strongest and most selfless person i know.
Thanks Tom, I told u how much this son meant to me with the passing of my father, grandma , and grandpa. U asked  a few weeks back what u should do next, I told u to do a video for this song, and wether u did it because of my message alone or not, I’ll take it as that. I love it brother, thanks. God bless u and Nova and all of HOG, much love!!
Still her on trending!! 4th video I saw!
Finally a great song man
My cousin died at 21 with stage 4 brain. I was diagnosed at 25 with stage 2 hodgkin's lymphoma. 8 chemo treatments and 25 days of radiation now 7 years remission. Thank you for this song and all your others.
We live in hell, I also believe there is a cure just wish they would help and let people survive cancer
this song is cancer to my ears.
Brother, you have no idea how close to home this hits😢.  Mother, mother-inlaw and sister-inlaw all lost to that f#%king disease.
I've had loved ones pass away from cancer. This song hits volumes. Thank you Tom. When I got all your CDs this song is one that definitely stuck out to me.

I have a sister fighting it everyday and a best friend it took... thank you for this
Thank you for this. My father just passed on Wednesday due to cancer. He fought till his last breath.
This song is so powerful.  I have never had a rap song make me emotional.  This song brought tears to my eyes.  Well done @Tom Macdonald, you are one of my favorite artists.
My family love you music this one hits home for us. We lost a lot of love ones from cancer thank you keep doing what you and your wife are doing you guys are awesome
All these cures and our governments ruled by one family who refuse to help anyone but themselves we need them to die keep everyone else safe
#5 trending! Let's go!!
Homie banger after banger your a legend
We need more Tom’s great song and very real.love it Tom
I waited to watch, I knew it was going to hit me hard...I just lost my sister to cancer last year. Not blood, but that’s not the point. It took her fast...this song dropped me to my knees 😓
Hey Tom love your music. I couldn't listen to this song I only got 21 seconds in and had to stop. My grandmother passed away do to lung cancer and in the 21 seconds I listened to all I could do is cry. I miss her and this just brought back all the memories. Thank you for all you do. I am sure I will be able to get through this song one day just not right now.
Thank you for doing this. I lost my mom 2 years ago to cancer.
Thank you for the amazing music brother.  This song hits home, prayers to all those fighting to live ♡♡
I was diagnosed with Non Hodgkin’s lymphoma at the age of 15. I put it in remission and now, I get to enjoy being in the Marine Corps.
Man this hit hard. Lost both grandparents to cancer not long ago.
I've lost many loved ones to cancer. I love how you're constantly spitting truths! Much love to you, brother! Keep shining that light!😊😇✌💖
#5 on trending now. Congrats tom
nice message its real and i love it
I pray no one will ever caught up by this
My name is Ryan sikes and my mom died from cancer. This song is one of the most true songs I have ever heard. Thanks tom and thanks to the ones that help you spread your message. One love.
I hope you get it
Bro this song brought tears to my eyes my father beat cancer 7 times to die from a cold because his immune system was gone... It's the worse thing I swear... Watch the ones you love wither away and die thank you for letting the world know and always keeping it real
Dude..... whoa😭
Wow 💛
thank you for this. rest east grandpa. you served your time.
I swear he’s the only rapper who actually speaks on real hard topics 🙏🏼
I was trying to hold back, but at 36 seconds I couldn't hold back the water works any longer. I lost my father to the hospital/cancer 5 years ago, he was only 55 years old. It was by far the worse thing that has ever happened in my life. I could go on all day about how awesome he was but I'm won't..  For a man who NEVER smoked, drank, did drugs or anything reckless. For a person who was that much of a good person and ate healthy you get a horrible cancer and just die means there's other stuff going on..  Prayers for any and everybody that is dealing with cancer and their loved ones that are going through it with them
Finally someone using their voice and platform  to address something that desperately needs to be addressed!!! Thank you Tom 😷
Fuck dude... you are killing it I found all your music during this rona bullshit,love the positive vibes and good messages you are spreading keep it up man stay true to yourself
Why don’t you go to medical school and give us the cure then
GREAT SONG BRO A TEAR JERKER MAKES ME THINK OF THE pain , suffering my mom was in before losing to cancer
Fuck this hit me hard. Tom you aren’t a rapper anymore. You’re a LEGEND. 🙏🙏🙏🙏
This is a BANGER! #1 up coming rapper just killing it!! Wish you the most success, find Jesus and you'll know where your going after this! This is just temporary! Good song
i have covid . my days are counted . like share and subscribe
Wow tom this is just WOW . Keep up the excellent work man . Dont ever stop please .
Bro beans. I tell everyone I meet about your music. I just miss music that speaks truth and comes from the heart. I generally only listen to classic rock but most of your songs speak to my soul. Thank you for giving me hope in this cold cold world
Man there's not a song I skip keep it up I can listen to you all day for real screw the haters.
1.2 Thousand ( and counting ) people are all for depopulation of the world. Just in case anyone's wondering how anyone could dislike this.  Probably twatifa and their overlords.
RIP to my father I lost to cancer wish he could have heard this song love goes out to all that a fighting this
“no comment,”💪
Think I got cancer listening to this LMAO
My aunt past away at 16 years old from an ovarian cancer your not supposed to get till after you hit menopause. She past away on this day 23 years ago. Crazy how you put this song out on the very same day 😩❤️
So he's implying that the doctors just haven't bothered to find a cure? Yeah that's gonna help people heal
Song is amazing man, video would have been so much better if you found a girl willing to actually shave her head for the msg and not use a bald cap, but still beautiful song man
I'm 32 at stage 4 , 4 years battling cancer
💯💪
When I was 20 I had thyroid cancer and beat that I'm 26 and fighting with my lungs now. I refuse to give up! This song made me kinda depressed for a minute but the message is encouraging
Thank you Tom for always pushing the truth and positivity.
Fire man just fire!
Loss to Cancer is all around me..I Live in a town where we had illegal toxic dumps by one of our factories...Our cancer ratio was so high that the government stepped in...every house had to have a check for  radiation toxins...they would bore down in every area of your yard....then they would test inside our homes with a reader.....I have watched our beach being dug down and our docks being literally destroyed to rid the earth of all the toxic waste they dumped in our waters...Our homes have lost most of their sale value due to this. In  year I have lost many I have known to Cancer...I presently for 4 years have been a target for constant checking due to spots and masses in lungs and an aggressive pre cancerous polyps in my colon...I can never seem to test clean enough to graduate from the constant checking and just go to regular screening. SO yes it is a fear I live with all the time...I cry for the little girl down the street from me that lost her battle to cancer this year..and the young girl who went to highschool with my grandson and got her diploma then passed away short few months later...Cancer runs 3 generations in my family and I chose to move to this town at 16 years old..A Cancer town caused by corruption. They hired a specialist Dr. Suzuki and he even said don't move the toxin..leave it alone...Makes you wonder cause they dug it all up...and whatever happened to the company that was dumping???? NOTHING...they were dumping mercury and uranium in our waters and in peoples residential yards while they slept...Tom I have always felt they don't want a cure out there..The government makes a ton of money off the present treatment now that is so poisonous that it kills cancer cells even though sometimes very temporarily- but with a cure that repeat cycle is done is gone and so is their money...Love the song it is powerful..talks about every part of cancer..the stats...the corruption.....the pain..the fear...the heart and soul..
Thank you for this song.  I lost my mom to terminal breast cancer on March 10, 2020.  Her services were scheduled for March 17.  That morning I was in the shower when the phone calls came through that the governor of Iowa was shutting down businesses and gatherings over 10 people.  My mom's visitation was cancelled.  Here we are, mid October, and still haven't been able to celebrate my mom's life because of COVID.  My mom was somewhat of a doomsday prepper.  She had a pantry in her basement that she filled with food and supplies just in case we ever faced a situation where we couldn't get what we needed.  When the store shelves were empty, that pantry fed a lot of people.  She even had hundreds of disposable facemasks.  We kept some and donated several boxes to the local hospice house so family members could continue to spend time with their loved ones before they left this earth. The world started to end the day my mom died.  I haven't seen normal since the last time I saw her.
Love the message! keep it up brother.
This is soooooo true God bless
I said it once before and I'll say it again, TOM MACDONALD FOR PRESIDENT! if only half the people in the world cared the way he does!!
Thank you Tom I’ve been struggling and whenever I feel like giving up your art keeps me going thank you
You called it man. I'm all choked up I've lost so many to cancer. My best friend died at 25 back in 07' left behind two beautiful daughters. I have him tattooed on my hand to remember him everyday. Bless anyone who has been affected by this horrible disease. Thank you for this one Tom and Nova. ❤️🧡💛
I got my seat 🍿 This is ²deep
My daughter was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2012 at 5 years old. Seeing her go through 2 brain surgeries 6 weeks of radiation and year of chemotherapy. Her losing her hair was very hard. I wish I had the money to get her a wig of some sort for the top of her head where the big U shaped scar is. Her whole childhood was robbed by cancer. So she wasn't able to go and do normal kids stuff. I wish I could afford to take her places where she can have fun and make memories instead of the only memories is of hospital rooms and painful procedures. It's just me and my daughter so i don't have any help with her and honestly my depression has worsened since she was diagnosed. I can't lose her and I wish I could trade places with her. The information I found is insane when it comes to pediatric cancer. Childhood cancer research is consistently underfunded. Less than 4% of the federal budget for cancer research is dedicated to childhood cancer. Each day, 43 children are diagnosed with cancer in the US which means 15,590 children in the U.S. are diagnosed each year. The average cost associated with childhood cancer in 2018 was $833,000 for one child for medical costs and lost parental wages.  One in four families lose more than 40% of their annual household income as a result of childhood cancer treatment-related work disruption, while one in three families face other work disruptions such as having to quit work or change jobs. 1,190 children (aged 0 -14) and 540 adolescents (aged 15-19) are expected to die from cancer in 2020 (excluding benign and borderline malignant brain tumors). About 1 in 285 children will develop cancer before the age of 20.  46 children per day or 16,850 children per year are expected to be diagnosed in 2020 with cancer (11,050 ages 0 to 14, and 5,800 ages 15 to 19) . 5,270 children under 20 years will be diagnosed with brain and other CNS Tumors. Cancer is a club no one wants to ever join but are forced into. Thank you for this song.  My daughter and I love it. https://youtu.be/oTaNRr0__pE
Back on trending I see
Your right dude,, I cried.
it's dope tom
Greatest artist, you always have a message..😥
Dude!!!
Damn I used to hate your music I might be a fan now
😭😭 such a strong message in a song keep it going man
If you die without LORD JESUS CHRIST you won’t goto to heaven. accept JESUS CHRIST GOD ALMIGHTY as your Lord and Savior. LORD JESUS said “I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man comes unto the father but through”. Pray to LORD JESUS CHRIST and ask JESUS to come into your heart, and be your personal Lord and Savior. Please. Romans 10:9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.
This song came at a perfect time. I lost my twin bother on Oct 21st and it will be 3 years since coming up soon. I pretty much cried this entire song. Keep making amazing music Tom. We all love and appreciate it.
Great Song Tom & Nova. Cheers Mate!!
GOD BLESS you Tom MacDonald.
RIP MUM 🤎
Why is this song rated as explicit on spotify?
RIP Thomas York 12/21/1998
My mum had breast cancer. She fought it, and she's in remittion now. We couldn't believe it when she got her diagnosis, we don't have a family history of breast cancer. The mails in our family have a history of prostate, but as far as we know mum is the first woman in the family to have had breast cancer.  She fought it, every round of chemo she had, she would end up in hospital days later with an infection; because of course it chemo fucks your immune system.  We live in a country town and mum couldn't have radiation therapy here because at the time our town didn't have a facility for it. So I traveled to the nearest town and an hour away and stayed with her for the 5 days a week she had radiation and then on the weekends we would come home. Luckily she lives with my husband and I, so on the weekends while she rested and got to sleep in her own bed, I could spend time with my husband. That was my time to cry and be angry with cancer, because I couldn't do it Infront of her. She needed me to be strong.  Mum is doing so well now, but that fear is always there that it might come back.   And now in the last 2 weeks we have found out that my father in-law's prostate cancer, has spread to his hip and spine (in the bones) we are not naive, we know what that means. Once it's in the bones it's only a matter of time. Cancer is a fucking evil disease. It doesn't matter who you are, how much money you have, how good of a person you are. You can still get it. Fuck Cancer. Like we said when my mum had cancer we are gonna kick it in the tit!
Did you know:  Chemotherapy can actually cause new cancer/s  If this happens the doctor instead of saying the clear truth will say *"we've successfully beaten original cancer but now you have 'this new' cancer."* which by the way can become more difficult to treat, with often poor outcomes for the patient.
I lost my grandmother who was like a mother to me due to cancer she fought and was in remission twice before she was finally unable to fight and this song right here dam near has me in tears it is truly one of your best man keep it up! FUCK CANCER
You jerk you were right it made me cry. Thank you! This song hit home for a lot of us. Love you brother.
Shine that light Tom
Good message, bad song
Thanks Tom this song means so much to me I lost my mom to the Chemotherapy they gave her
Who tf disliked this...weirdos 🤪
Great message
My 37 yr old wife and mother of 4 is fighting for her life with triple negative breast cancer. Anyone reading this, please pray for my family. Please
Honest question. How do you release a song and I think theres no way he can make a bigger or better song. Then you prove me and everyone wrong. Thank you to you and Nova. You have made my life better bc of your music. HOG 4 LIFE!
Cancer research UK has been going for over a 100 yrs and still refusing to use what is naturally out there
I lost my uncle in 2016 to cancer. He had it for maybe 6 years. I was never told when he got it because I was fairly young . He meant everything to me
This was beautiful and I have lost a lot to cancer...thanks for all the music you make it hits on real shit people deal with
Tell me why 1200 dont like the truth sad 😞
#SPEAKOUT, #FIGHTHEIRLIES
He's basically using people with cancer for money cause hes not raising awareness for cancer cause basically everyone knows about it
Thanks for this song Tom! Absolutely love it. Lost my dad to cancer in 2013 while I was in Afghanistan. I hate cancer! #FCancer
I fucking HATE cancer I myself am 15 years cancer free any time I hear about someone battling cancer I can relate I agree that they've GOTTA have a cure after all like you said we've been donating money and wearing ribbons for ages I wish they'd finally put the cure out for it
The fact that there are people who are disliking this song just goes to show how nasty people are in this world
This guy is so cringe lol
I read a statistic. 80% of pharmaceutical drugs are derived from natural sources, my question is why not go right to the source. It's all of these artificial chemicals were allowing into our bodies. Big pharma makes customers, not cures.
Good music
What a beautiful and powerful message. I'm a huge fan of yours Tom, And have been for years now. I always love the messages you send in your songs, And how you're not afraid to stick it in anyone's face no matter how uncomfortable is subject may be.  I myself am no stranger to having lost love ones to this  Vicious disease. I believe strongly that the power of your mind can be one of the most determining factors in beating this. Thank you for this song. Which could completely change somebody's mind set. Keeping Being the amazing person you are. I am so grateful.
Wow. What a strong song.
Already had much respect for your words. You just got more. Real deal!!!!
This is awesome Tom keep doing good work it will help a lot if people!!❤️
I hated the first verse, but it's a decent time beyond that part. I have chronic leukemia, fuck cancer.
Tom is a lyricist rapper most underrated, he should collab with yelawolf. 🔥⚡
They can't make money from Healthy people, it's sad but true 😔
No Words.... Just TEARS...😢😢😢
His heart was probably in the right place but the video is ridiculous sorry.... Acting is terrible.... cinematography is really awkward... girl is wearing a wig and then puts on a wig cap. Like.. they can't even find an actress to shave her head?
Thank you Tom for this, my mom is actually fighting cancer, even with Treatment she may not have long to live, but I'm glad you released this, cuz I've realized so much in life now and I'm inspired and been writing songs and want to record.them for my mom. So she can hear me and what I have to say before I could lose her to Cancer.
You gotta quit messing around and Marry Nova🤷‍♂️🤔😍
Thank you for your words and music. They help people in so many different ways. I lost my dad to stage 4 lungs cancer 6 years ago. It was harding watching it devour him as well as the chemo. Wish this song was out back then because maybe then he would've fought a little harder.  Once again thank you.
Ofc “they” know the cure for cancer, and if you research enough, you can find it yourself. Research a man named dr sebi. Diseases and cancer thrive in an acidic environment, it can’t live in an alkaline one. Nature has a cure for everything, the cure for cancer is an alkaline diet, and certain alkaline herbs. The missing link most people leave out is gratitude. Whoever has gratitude (for their health) will receive more, whoever does not have gratitude (for their health) will be taken from.
Thanks Tom my boy I got prostate cancer and there nothing they can do but I hope to out live this problem I really love this song
Great stuff👍👍
Ann sending love to Danny. Thinking of you. 💜 Keep Fighting
I LOVE U TOM , 😭
I lost my son to cancer and this song is the truth!! Thank you for an amazing song!!!

Lost my dad to a rare form of cancer called Chordoma. 1 in 3 million may develop it and by the time most people find it, like my dad, it's too late. https://www.chordomafoundation.org/  Everyone please check out the link for information on Chordoma and the research that is being done. God Bless HOG Fam.
Keeping it REAL, LOVE FROM A SURVIVOR!
Lost my mom to cancer 20 years ago. I miss her and my dad so much. It was hell burying both my parents by the age of 21. It still hurts today. I spent 18 years in drug addiction after they passed, but i been four years clean now. Im trying to make them proud now! Thanks Tom!!
If you want to know what happens when you die, please choose Jesus. Evil things are happening and you will need the holy spirit to fight it. I love you guys. <3

My friend does cancer research and there are cures, there are just so many different types and a lot of the cures require to be customized to the individual. They also aren't FDA approved....regulation gets in the way of saving people.
Masterpiece.
The thing about cancer is that it's YOUR OWN cells that are malfunctioning. There's no "cure" to cancer because cancer isn't some foreign entity. It's your own body messing up. Things that kill cancer cells also kill healthy cells. It's not a conspiracy or a ploy to make money. It's just an extremely nuanced field
You know what. . . . . . the reality is. . . . they are jst faking us.
Gosh I love this dude music
The system is a prison.... ya...
I know only few of you can answer this tough question. , . . .. . I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no-body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?
Finally... Another song about feminism
Great song Tom. You again hit the nail on the head, we are nothing more then a profit margin to the global elites. [They] aren't looking for a cure, [they] are looking for medications that save JUST ENOUGH of us that we will dump everything we have into saving ourselves and loved ones. Stay strong 👊
Cancer hit me hard when diagnosed in 2018.  I'm in remission now.  It changed my outlook on life.  Living 6 months at a time makes a person value life and time more.  Anyone battling cancer right now hold your head up...don't let the dark thoughts take over.  Your mind is your worst enemy and you have to fight for control.  That's the real battle.  Tom Macdonald thank you for putting your heart into this.
Excellent
After the woke stuff the rock stuff hit soo harder, why can’t these other rapper see real for real
😿🙊💀☠💩
Omg this is amazing dude I lost my mum yo cancer at 16. They told me after my exams and after two weeks of being told she was gone. Such an amazing strong woman.  This song will help so many that haven't got the strength
Mad respect for what u do. I just don’t like when u say “if there something else.”  The way I see it is. This is it???? This can’t be all were made for. There has to be more. God bless.
Cancer took my son Reid and then later that same year my mother 2 years ago 😔, thank you for this🙏 #TEAMREID
My mom had breast cancer and just finished her 3 surgery after chemotherapy
Tom this was amazing
I found a lump in my leg last year. Finally went and saw the doctors to check it out. And was very lucky to have it cut out with the lump coming back as a low grade sarcoma. Just thinking if I left it for longer or never getting it checked, it could of been a much worse situation than have most of my inner thigh muscle out and a large scare. Many people think cancer is just a simple thing to just cut out or fit. When it's not. I'm still recovering and my leg will never be the same. But I'm thankful for the people to help me through it.
Going to make people come together I pray bro. Amazing lyrics Tom. Amazing!!!  💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
If we don't buy stupid shit  ,they not selling......
Whoa. Hard truth in these bars. 🔥🔥
Me to geuss how my aunt died its not cancer look how my sisters were doing drugs as teenagers paying people to kill us thanks man really😥😥🙏🙏❤❤☝️☝️
thanks bro. good looking out
Treatment is in CBD  , Why we don't fight for this natural and cheap cure......???
Month 1 pops cancer went away, month 2 pop had full blown!r.i.p poppa doc you still walk with me
This sends and is such a STRONG message... RESPECT ✊🏽
Stop eating meat.... Try it
Thank you Tom
First thing I listened to today and wow tears already!?
You've made me a fan of a genre' I could never have gotten behind before. I suppose though it's more  a fan of you and your fight than of a genre'. I have great love for what you're doing through what you love, I have love for your truth and your honestly. I have love for what you're shining a light on when so many others hide in the shadows. I have love for how you're proving 30 pieces of silver is worth so little when it's the truth that sets your free.  I have love for how you've chosen to "keep the faith", so stop proclaiming that you're probably going to hell, and where is hell anyway, when its ruler harassers us here day after day? You're fighting the good fight and you're fighting it outside of religion and you're fighting by faith alone, and you're winning. You have His Spirit and you have rewards awaiting you that most of us are too damned timid and afraid to seize. You're going home to our Father when your fight here is done. There are no sheep in the war His elect are fighting today and the "so called" shepherds behind those ornate doors are leading the sheep astray. You're a lion my friend
i just lost my dad less than 6 months ago due to cancer. its the hardest thing i have ever had to go through. it took his so quick . life just isnt the same anymore , it seems life just gets harder and harder without him around
Touching hearts
Ok so I respect tom alot for this because I actually had cancer but heated it I was 14 or 13 forgot honestly but I've been cancer free for a year I had throat cancer I heated it thank god n if you all go through it I hope you beat it as well I'm 17now

Great words of truth brother. Nailed it again.
This is what I told Tom MacDonald: if you or anyone you know currently and or has been affected by cancer in any way this song is for you. I think the video and song is very sweet but it didn't make me cry. The one thing that I don't understand is you say we buy cigarettes and liquor we are paying to kill ourselves a business built on addiction. Yet you smoke so you are contradicting exactly what you're saying you are are you speaking in the song. You have to be a good example for the kids and please don't smoke I would just hate for something to happen to you and have the same thing happened to you that you're talking about in the song. I'm very against smoking because my mom did it when she was pregnant I now have cerebral palsy I'm 24 now so this affects me personally in a way. You are contradicting yourself in this song and you could get cancer from the very thing you're doing that you are telling kids not to do it kind of makes me angry not only that but Nova and you do not need that. the  cigarettes is exactly what caused my cerebral palsy and now I'm in pain every single day but I didn't have a choice because I was a baby I know that's not necessarily what you're talkin about in this song but you get my point right now Just like you say sometimes the truth hurts However, I do understand the point he is trying to make in this song and I do agree with them 100% https://youtu.be/WQnYq5Q-4D8
Wow. That one hit me deep. Thank you both!
This man right here is the TRUTH!!!
i’m sitting here sobbing in my car on break. This is so moving. thank you.
Let's keep this song moving up!
Fuck I'm glad this only went for a couple mins.. honestly dont think I would have lasted another 30secs without losing it. Props man.. as always.
I lost my nana from cancer thanks for this song
Dispite the way he looks he really is talented! Never judge a book by its cover.
Speechless😭😭😭😭😭💔
Wednesday , aunt passed away. Started at overy, spread to colon, liver , lungs, brain and bones. She will be missed!!
Thanks Tom waiting for you here in Augusta Georgia
That’s deep bro
cringe
Thank the lord theres a god because my friend had cancer and she fucking beat it like a trooper,I love you tom,you're a trooper
You're AMAZING my friend!!! ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥Much love... Keep it going
I'm 29 and found out I have 3 tumors in my throat. No insurance of course. Just for blood work and an ultrasound it ran me 3,200! The struggle is real, but I told myself this can't take over my life.
I'm not crying, you are
From what my mom and grandmother used to tell me my grandfather he passed away from cancer to soon and then many years down the line my mom had gotten lung cancer its scary but your not alone everyone that is going through that kinda hurt I have you all in my prayers ❤
I keep listening to this, hits me different everytime... You have hit a nail in the coffin with this one Tom! Another great song, produced by two great people. Thank you for this song Tom MacDonald. I'll keep listening to it too!
When are you publishing Dreams?good song
This song hits close to home... I watched my farther fight for 2 years with lung cancer. Even after losing a lung to it he still kept fighting. But when he finally lost the fight i did quite a bit of digging around the interwebs....just to find out that they have many cures for it!! But everyone that they have found that truly helps, they have made the chemical compounds and made them illegal so that people cant even run tests on them!! This was one of the steps that lead me to despise big pharma and the politics the crazy left brings to the table... These money hunger, sad excuses for doctors that dont stand up for their patients shouldnt be in charge!! #firefauci !! If money made is more important then the health of your patients, you dont deserve to be a doctor!!!!!
So touching  My living best rapper  I choose you Tom you're my best
Youre a hero in my eyes tom i have so much respect for what you do and youre also independent its verry dificult to get there without a record label but you did it and what you rap about is verry strong man keep this good shit up much love💯 f*ck illuminati theyre killing us all we need to wake up
Thanks you man https://youtu.be/2gCJlnUCsDg
There are 2 natural way to get ride of cancer.  1.  Alkaline your body cancer can not live in alkaline investments.  Go to the garrison institute web page to learn more.  2. Eat no carbs at all . It starves the cancer. It has to have sugar to survive.
Hold the fact that your words are reaching those who have been touched by these truthful words dear to your heart my friend!!One day Tom we will conquer this ugly death...
This brought me to tears... I lost my mom and sister to cancer. Thank you so much for all the passion that goes into every single track.
I lost my dad in 2016 to cancer , this is very hard daily
I was diagnosed with cancer in June 2020, this song is so true.  I'm putting poison into my body to cure a disease that we surely have a cure for.
What an amazing song. Thank you for this ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🖤
My dad was diagnosed with cancer in August, thank you for this tom!
Tom you are best thing to happen to 2020 👌 keep it up mate 👍 😉
This made me cry thanks Tom😭😭☺️☺️🥺🥺🥺
Man I’m not the biggest fan of your music no offense but I love this song and and have a whole new level of respect for you and just want to thank you for this song cause my grandma has cancer and she been fighting it the last 4 years and she’s a fighter
This is fire bro
🙏  keep living like we don't know what it is. Keep faith.
Please Pray for my Mom- Im a Stranger- at a lost for words- i feel stuck in Limbo and helpless- Please- If only 1 Person Reads this and sends upp a Prayer for a "Strangers" mom- I would be so grateful-  i pray my mom overcomes all that she's being hit with mentally and healtgh wise- i Pray for Her For Healing- I'm..Scared- & so is she even though she acts strong- I sit here on my knees and Pray- Jesus Take The Wheel..

Hey Demi Lovato this is what you call Inspirational Songs , not your songs that talk rubbish about our Commander in Chief  🖤 *!*
I haven’t been able to grieve over my Dad passing from lung cancer 2 years ago and over my Mom who passed away 2 weeks ago from lymphoma.  After watching and listening to this song, I was finally able to cry.  All the emotions I felt but held back while watching my parents’ battles with cancer all came flooding back and I collapsed.  Thank you Tom.  This has to be the most profound, soul grasping song I’ve ever heard.  Thank you.
Tbh i don't share everything you say. But the video still has some good points though
What an incredible song such powerful lyrics!!!!
This gave me goosebumps! Just amazing! You have no limits! And to anyone fighting cancer, keep fighting you are strong!!
*"People Who Like This You Will Be A Billionaire One Day"* *"Good Luck For All"😎*

*To the person that is reading this: You're very intelligent and adorable human BE SAFE❤️*
Keep speaking the truth 💯
this song is so deep and true why would anyone dislike your one of the best artists bro i love all ur songs
✌💚🙏
These are my thoughts and feelings exactly.. the drs and scientists don’t wanna find a cure bc cancer is their leading income unfortunately.. I had cancer when I was 18, lost my aunt to lung cancer, my meme’re to the same thing.. thank you for your honesty tom, much love and appreciation for your heart, soul and strength ♥️ Great great song so many of us can relate to!!!
The Odds say most likely : You're not allowed to leave. After you die you will find yourself forced to exist again, in a strange place created for that very existence, just like right now.  :)
Here is a tip - next time go to a white doctor.
I doubt someone will see this but it’s worth a shot! I need help with some medical bills as I am drowning in debt at the moment! If you see this can you please help me out! Thank you ❤️    Venmo: victor2381
My brother had cancer twice when he was 10 and 14 he is now 46. My hero ❤️
Cancer survivor here in my 30s. Going in next week for another biopsy. Pray for me!
Words of truth!%100
Love it! Fight!
This is so powerful... 👏👏👏👏
I’m crying
I lost my boyfriend to lung cancer back in April. He was one hell of a fighter, but lost to an infection that developed in his lower stomach. He was a really big fan of yours, and I wish he could have been here to hear this song. 😔
@tom macdonald you have no idea how much I needed right now with my mom just starting chemotherapy
Don't listen to much rap anymore and hate the newer stuff because of the messages given. Good on you and what you rap about.
I’m not crying, you’re crying!          In all seriousness Tom. Thank you. No other words can describe how amazing this song is.
Appreciate The Message but Song Sucks. Here comes the Back Slide
Tom you are a better truth talker than me
Brilliant song,video! But more importantly a brilliant message to send to the world! Lost my mum to cancer and it sucks so much. I’ve also believe they have had a cure for a long time but won’t tell the world. Royal family here in the UK for instance, never had any cases through their whole family from what I’ve read.
💜💜 Such a beautiful and truthful song! 😭💜 This has touched my soul!!!
cringe
STOP GIVING YOUR KIDS VACCINES
this guy is awful worst muscis ive ever heard he would be dead in the uk within a week
God created us with free will.  He will NOT cross that will.   For people whom think that God would never send people to such a horrid place as hell.   1st God doesn't send anyone anywhere.   2nd Believing on and in Jesus or not, is our choice...... Our will.  3rd We send ourselves , to our own destination.  4th God has restrained his power to our will.  5th God is not a cheater.... And he most defiantly wouldn't cheat himself ,his own rules or His Glory!  6th God mourns each soul lost.....   Lost..... While found was FREE.  Run to Jesus. Time is short!!!
Mom passed from Ovarian cancer and my sister from Breast. Thank you.
Great song brother !! My best friend and his 5 year old son our both going through cancer treatments what’s crazy it’s almost the exact same cancer. Tell me how that happens . God Bless.
Beautiful
Respect to all fighting this desease.
Cancer, chemtrails    Join the dots
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cancer is from A demon on sickness & disease. Jesus paid to set us free from sin & death & sickness & slavery to darkness & curses & spells. We can NOW be set free from All the powers of darkness threw Faith in Jesus!😃🙌🕵📖
GODDAMNIT TOM
😭
Deep bro.    God bless 😇
RIP MOMMA LOVE 💖 THXS TOM
Another masterpiece by a master lyricist
You are so contraversal your music makes so much sense,....   I used to think eminem understood but now he's just too big for his briches.   Just keep doing what ur doing.... ... faithful fan
dude,it's a  meanful song, love ya!! peace
I agree 100% we should be advanced enough to not have to use chemotherapy anymore we have much better Science and Technology and the only reason they're still using it is because it's a multibillion-dollar industry big Pharma
This track left a big lump in my throat!  I sadly lost my beautiful Mum in March just 3 weeks after finding out she had lung cancer, she never had a chance really and it breaks my heart to thinks there's a cure out there yet there's so many loving people, families, friends left to suffer to horrid disease......another great track Tom!
Big pharma and the cancer industry go hand in hand. 5% chance of recovery with chemo and radiation cause it isn't about healing. A patient cured is a customer lost. Big business to shoot poisons into your body expecting a healthy outcome. Go the all natural route. Marijuana and green eating.
Great song!
I lost my dad to cancer 5 years years ago. He was 55, thank you for this song Tom.
This hit me hard. Had a mother figure that had lung cancer. She helped me with so much while fighting Bertha. That's what she called it. Miss you mom.
Amazing as always ! ( Mby even better )
My mother passed in 1996 from bone cancer. She was 53 yrs. Old.
Thank God, my 32 year old sister survived, my 10 year old cousin, and so did I 12 years ago 🙏🙏🙏
ohhhh snap on trending 👌🏻
I shared this to my aunt who had breastcancer. She cried. Thank you Tom. Im glad to see people give a damn about real issues.
My cousin was diagnosed with leukemia when she was 6 months old and beat but unfortunately she was diagnosed at 5 and that battle went on till she was 13. She couldn't fight it any longer and passed 2 years ago. This song is true to the nature of cancer and how we live life today. H.O.G
😎🤘💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪✈️🚀
This is alot man! R.I.P to all who died out of 'Cancer'💔😭🙏
This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that even breaking just one of these commandment makes us guilty of breaking them all.   The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..  So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved .   The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘it is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ .
mark and tom from blink 182 singing the chorus wouldve been amazing
who are the 1000 wankers who gave it a thumbs down? Bet it was mac lethal 1000 times...
So true about addictions I'm Still trying to put that bottle down part of me wants to keep drinking tho because it take away the pain but also while it's helping it's also harming for the past two years I'd drink till I'd blackout I still drink without blacking out now but it's still hard man
My grandma passed in 2013 I love this song by you Tom I  watched my grandma slowly and slowly dying them she slipped into an unresponsive coma she struggled too breath and I didn’t get too say good bye which kills me the most
Lost three family member this way, people I've worked along side have passed from this as well. Horrible horrible thing
What we have to know ' that more are getting cured .and always the scientists are working hard to for find less intrusive and better ways to get rid of it !
Seriously I just spent 6 hrs listening to this and people’s reviews on this video, it has gotten mad love from everyone. this is truly moving and speaks not only those who are/have suffered but all of us who support or have survived a loved one. We wish you were wrong about big Pharma, sadly we know you are speaking the truth...
Cancer has a cure.....treatment makes more more MONEY ....FACTS
My grandfather is dying of pancreatic cancer. He probably only has a few weeks left. This was much needed
probably your Best Song in my opinion!!
I lost my mom to this shit love the song
Wow Tom wow  Keep up the good work mate 👌 You're a legend
I couldn’t watch this but still let it run and liked it to support
Tom and nova never fails to impress
My grandma died when I was 3
I lost my mom April 16th of this year, she passed away 4 days after her birthday from metastatic cancer. Her breast cancer came back and went undiagnosed for a year by her doctor who had told her it was just old age aches and pains, it had spread to her bones and she had to walk with a cane. Slowly over the next year she became bed ridden and depended on everyone. She couldn't get treatment because we couldn't afford any insurance that would cover it. We tried for almost 2 years to get medicaid to cover it and get her disability. She finally got it at the end of last year, far to late for any treatment by that point. The doctors said her body was covered in cancer. The hardest part was watching her try so hard, be so brave and strong one moment, then watching her break down crying and saying she didn't want to die, then to watch her rapidly decline to the point she needed morphine constantly to cope. She ended up getting gangrene in her feet and there was nothing they could do. They told us if they operated, she wouldn't make it through the surgery. I miss her everyday and still find it hard to not wake up with tons of emoji's and funny gifs telling me good morning and "I love you"s.  My mom would have loved this song. Anyone who is fighting cancer or knows someone who is, just stay strong and have hope. It's not over until it's over. Stay strong and remember to tell everyone you love, that you love them everyday. ♥
Thanks Tom. I've lost many family members and some friends to. The more I think about giving a dollar at the grocery checkout to these foundations the more angry I get. How many fucking ribbons and stickers do we wear or show? They mean nothing. All this money and yet all the death. The industry is a fucking scam. It really pisses me off. They have a cure but they can't afford to give it to us. They'll lose too much money. Fuck cancer and all these worthless foundations. Also locks of love can suck it too!
Felt that 👊🏼🔥
Wow... That got too me. Nice one tom.
Another great amazing song Tom. Thank you for sharing. Love the way you are.
Thank you  cause it is true what you are saying everyone is touched in someway
I'm going to heaven..I'm saved by the blood of Jesus.
🙏😌🙏
U got me to tears.I know that feeling personaly.Its sad and long fight,full of faith but sometimes not all ends good.Love you my brother
thank you next
Let's get it to #1 SHOW YT what people actually want
Who else would like to see tom on crowder or Shapiro's show
4 years later this mans going to die of “unknown causes”
I lost my mum 21 years ago to cancer I was 18 with an 2 year old if it wasn't for that 2 year old I would have jumped in that grave after her she was my mum my best friend and the other half of me you never forget and the pain never goes you just learn to live on 💞
Such a powerful song.....a couple different people in my family had it.....fighting didnt help them......
"It's scary because we dont know where we go when we die." Well worth the wait, wow what a song, Tom when is the treatment no longer a treatment? When its remedy is worse than the illness, thank you for this I can tell this meant alot to you. As a man in recovery, yeah I was paying to kill myself. Its sick God bless anyone with any type of physical or mental illness. God Bless All you fighters. My best friend does not have cancer but he is addicted to drugs and alcohol and he doesn't realize how strong or how much of a fighter he is like a lot of people and I sent him this song because this is the song that he needs he is in a bad spot right now in a very dark spot and he needs just that little light to stay on and this song can keep that light on
Dude I just lost 3 close friends to cancer and countless more over the years. Thanks for speaking the truth
Rad Tom! Keep fighting people!
Indeed tom cancer is finishing us. Remember bossman "black panther star" died from cancer? WHO should find the cure quickly before we pass out.
Thank you Mr. MacDonald.
Thank you for writing this song Tom. It really hit me hard and made me cry. When i was 24 i dated a guy who had leukemia and we were together for almost a year. I stayed at his house one night and he told me "goodnight my love. I'll see you in the morning" but when i woke up i saw that he had passed away in his sleep and it hit me harder than anything else so this song means a lot to me. Thank you again Tom. May the goddess bless you in all that you do. Blessed be
This is lil bit wired cuz a day before this song drop I had some die to it
Can we ask why now ? There is no money in cures . All the doctors who know cures are dying .  Also look to stats about kids cancers and compare that to the vaccine scedual that has ramped up through the years ! Cancer is not genetic,
Amazing song bro . I love your music
Respect ✊

This speaks to me on so many levels I don’t know where to begin. My best friend had cancer and unfortunately died, a few other friends and family members have had it and had similar outcomes, my mum had cancer and fortunately beat it. This is something they should have a cure for already, or as you said at the start probably do already but it makes them to much money so why let anyone have it. I’m normally happy listening to you music, for the first time I shed a tear for me friends that I lost to this... still love the song....
Why do you care? 🤔 Cause this looks like making money off of others losses
I can feel his pain in this song anyone else 💔💔🖤💯✊🏾🍻
To the 1 person who's reading this: You're very intelligent and adorable human! Stay healthy during this kinda quarantine 💕 💫
My mom just passed about 5 months ago from pancreatic cancer. They didn't find it until it was stage 4. She had been to countless doctors. There could have been something I have lost 3 people in 3 years to cancer. #fuckcancer #theyhavethecure #theyrejust greedy. Thanks Tom and Nova, I'm a recovering addict myself you guys give me hope. Even though things seem to be breaking down around me. ❤😘
I'm literally wiping away tears...I feel like almost everyone can relate to this song because they have had to deal with cancer in there life in some way or another...for me it was my grandmother who fought for 7 years before she lost and cancer took her...what a truly awesome song 🙏💓🤘
How do you make a more hard hitting song than this. I like the spoken word delivery, the serious and realistic tone, and I actually think the hook sounds really nice.  The video is very impactful as well, and the actress did a really good job.  Thank you TOM for addressing things that actually happen to real people.  Thats why you are my fav rapper in tha game right now.
Incredible song, and so true, who whole medical profession is just about money. To anyone suffering or affected by cancer, stay strong and god bless you. I lost my sister a couple weeks ago to cancer just 8 weeks after diagnosis, I wrote a song about her it's not as good as toms but if anyone wanted to listen it would be an honour, maybe help if you lost someone too I don't know, it helped me cope, it's my first ever song. Love to all and keep fighting 👊
Fire 🔥 fire 🔥🖐️
Thanks for this.
My gfs mom just passed cancer
Tom macdonald  love this song man. I've had quite a few family members and friends lose the battle with cancer and it hurts. And me, I've literally had a constant headache that never goes away and I'm seriously not playing. It hasn't stopped for a few years,, and It only goes from not too bad to crippling. They been tests done and no answer to a definite cause but im afraid one day there gonna tell me I have cancer too. Great song bro keep it up your one of my favorite artists.
No rapper like Tom is.
I love this song, I wish it had been around when my daughter had cancer. This really hits home for me. ❤ such a beautiful message. Ty
Can't relate, My country got great and cheap health care.
Good stuff 💚👍
How much of an ecochamber is this place? None of the top comments are talking about how the entire first verse of this song is flat out missinformation?
I just had a mental breakdown the other night thinking about my grandma that I lost to lung cancer. So many clinical trials, so many surgeries.. Such a long painful time... i hate cancer. She seemed to little and so heavy at the same time in the end. Man it hurts. Love yall, fxck cancer.
we, we as in this young generation. we have to change things. im so tired of living in a bullshit world, its all about money and power, not about humanity. We must change this system once and for all.
Thank you Tom
In general, I think the human body can fight off anything comes across or into its path. Unfortunately, the amount of social engineering our ego and inner self get weaker and weaker, and later give up the fight. So, listen to Tom and don't give up the fight and understand negativity as a social/mental psychosis that isn't real.
Tom you have come along way and I must say every step has been amazing and every imprint you have made will stay forever your so true and so understanding and at this time in the world we all need you and your music thank you for keeping your head up and pushing threw your own bad days to help others threw your music, your music is diamonds worth millions 😎🖤
It's TRUE.  My mum died on cancer 2 years ago. And the doctor said to her that if she will have money she might live , now she's not with us any more ask yourself why....
This song hits hard and it’s so true it hurts. My Nan had leukaemia which she beat in her 80s but when she got sick it came back with a vengeance. She never complained and just got on with it. Amazing song ❤️
Well these comments are extremely depressing
The cure for cancer was made but they killed the man who made it and said there’s no cure R.I.P dr sebi
xoxoxoWOWxoxoxo 100% TRUTH! My mum died this year, not from the cancer directly,  but the chemo, the so called treatment was so hard on her body she had a stroke... they helped her die.. research "palliative care". A friend of mine was diagnosed with cancer 6 years ago, doctor gave him 6 months to live.. he refused chemo, and decided to live a bit healthier, he is still alive today and going strong.
this comment goes out to auntie michelle, gram gram, and ms. flesher 💗
Tom. Man thanks so much for rapping about this. Bruh a lot a people may see you as toxic. And im not saying its true or not. All I'm saying is that its this that I was wanting from you. Thank you so much for this. Hope your life is amazing and wish nothing but the best
Got you to 6 bro
GI vegan then and u can cure cancer no joke
This is so trash lmao
Tom I have been listening to your music for nearly a month now and u never disappoint like I said I'm hang over gang till they Barrie my 6 feet under mad respect brother.
Damn... What a hard hitting track. Tom is always bringing the 🔥🔥🔥.
My aunt died with her second battle of brain cancer. The hospitals are thieves. 1 suture kit 30 bucks a kit jacked to 500 bucks like WTF
This song hits hard.  I lost my dad 2 years ago to cancer.  Still struggle today.   They need to make the cure. There’s evidence out there that shows us there is a cure.
All 1000 of Mac Lethals fans gave a dislike... losers.
https://youtu.be/H3JrdCtB7Rk
H. O. G forever!  Everyone should stay strong. My auntie had cancer 4 times. It's just never ending. Had 8 surgeries, she is 76 but still fighting already for like 12 years. Never, I mean literally never give up! Be happy about everything, because positivity kills bad things! ❤️❤️❤️
My aunt died of Cancer and she never had a chance with no insurance. It breaks my heart to think about what she went through.. Beautiful, but deep,?song yet again.. ❤️🙏🏼
The clean songs hit
I relate to this song so much.  I'm 26, a child of divorce and for the past 10 years of my life, it's just about my father and I.  He passed away a month back from liver cancer, I am still in disbelieve. It sucks thinking about it because I feel like I'm out here in the world alone now without my guiding light, my smile, my reason to laugh and my motivation to keep living in this world.
Damn Tom! You’re different, in a good way👌
no words can explain how you feel after losing someone you love to cancer I lost my grandparents and an uncle in one year due to cancer 💔sometimes it feels like i can still hear them talking and laughing.💔😔
🐐🐐🐐🐐
This corny af
0:46 they couldn't fix that shabby makeup job on her forehead?
Now this is a tough subject you won't see msinstream rappers sing about. Thank You 👍
Ever time I here this song brings a tear to my eye your stuff hits you like a brick wall never stop what you and nova are doing much love from the UK
Thank you cancer took my mom in February 2016 and I miss her every day  and I still cry ... I was lucky I beat cervical  cancer  but she was nothing to pancreatic cancer it took her in less than 3 years  💔💔 I miss her so
Wacklemore
noone will understand unless u have had ur own battle with this monster...:(
Vaccines, chem trails, and shit they put in our food is CANCER!
Paying them to kill ourselves deep
F@@k cancer... Love and miss you mom
This is a good song I lose two of my grandparents to cancer and my heart go out for the poeple who have to deal with it every day of the life and hope they find a cure for it soon
My S-I-L fights, 😢. She's strong, I hope we can beat this.
This hit home for me cause everyone on my dad's side of the family died from cancer including my dad....I've seen and known death since I was 3 years old ....my stepfather had throat cancer twice, he survived both times but sadly a few years later it was his heart that gave. I love this song cause it speaks volumes. 💖💪💖🙏🕊
So meaningful
been there dune this
Thank u 🌱
Not in my feed again!!! Had to go looking for it. Keep putting this wicked music out there, don’t be suppressed!!!
THANK YOU TOM!!!!!
Your most impressive song Tom🖤thank you for your gift and talents
I normally don't like his music, but this is 🔥
This makes me feel sad and angry 😡
Didn't care for Tom MacDonald all that much when all those Mac Lethal diss tracks were going back and forth, but that being said ... This track is fire.
Tom has done it again 👏 absolutely amazing
This was such a beautiful song *!!!!!
BRILLIANT!!! 😭😭❤️👏
I like it.
Thankyou so much for this song/video Tom and those who made it come into being. I fought for my health for five years. Five years being told " we can't find what is wrong. " I had begun to believe I was experiencing a form of physcosis that lead to symptoms manifesting within my body. Five years I held a smile on my face and was brave for my kids until they went out the door to school. When alone, I would curl into a ball and just cry. So much pain. So little sleep.  So much time begging and pleading with the doctors to look deeper.  It was during routine surgery that they finally found it. Cancer that had been growing for Five years.  I went through chemo, external beam radiation, Brachy therapy... I cried every minute I was away from my kids, but it made me fight harder. Nearly 5 years now I've been in remission and still trying to recoup, financially, physically and emotionally. It left scars on not only me but my family.  I can still see the worry on their faces with routine doctor appointments and any time I feel pain. They live in fear of it coming back. I just hold them close and say its okay, everything is okay and pray that I won't have to fight the Big C again.
I hope you see the change across the sky but have hope for your love ones and yourself  bless 🙏 ✨ ♥
Great song chom
Now I'm sad.
I literally can’t even think about this song without shedding a tear or two
How do people thumbs down this shit
Welcome the the lyric comments because people like to write the song down it makes them happy I guess
Great song
Looks like tooth cancer
Is this the guy who made ram ranch
Don't matter the topic Tom nails it every time. Fire song keep them coming

God bless

My maw maw had breast cancer, my paw paw died from lung cancer, my step cousin has leukemia and I’m nearing six years from surviving testicular cancer.
I lost a close aunt to cancer, some of here family and friends said she was a guardian angel to them bc she helped and  Listened to them.
My dad died on the 20th lung cancer he refused chemotherapy! R.IP.
idk why but this man is legendary
Rest in Peace Shav Chadwick Boseman FoxVans
We found out my dad has prostate  cancer in July.  This really hit home. Thank you. Much love.
Apparently Tom Macdonald thought I needed to start today with a good cry lol 😢😭 But this is a great song and message 🤟🤘❤
Mr. MacDonald, your music is lame. I'm sure it helps someone though. 🤷🏿‍♂️
My fiancé’s mother has been fighting cancer for a long time now. She finally got a bone marrow transplant! She’s having ups and downs and it’s been very rough, but mostly ups now and progress from what I can tell. Anyone going through this, remember you or your loved one may be sick rn, but you or your loved one can beat it. And to all those who have lost loved ones from it (I have lost some too), I am so sorry for your loss. It’s heartbreaking, I know. We can only pray that one day there will be a better way, and people won’t have to lose their lives or loved ones because of it. And even though it’s hard, we have to try and find some sort of comfort in the fact that they are no longer struggling or sick, and instead they are at peace.
Id be lying if i said i didnt cry..... gg Tom another amazing song
You are very talented. My fiancé is a two times Hoskins Lymphoma cancer survivor. I didn’t know him when he went through all the treatments. I meet him just a few months after his stem cell transplant. And I see how all that has done to his body. He’s been in remission for 4 years now and we are living life one day at a time. Thank you for this song. It’s amazing and emotional but true.
That is powerful.
They aint never going find a Cere for cancer They making to much MONEY off cancer patients Thats Their Hustle
Cancer is the real pandemic but people are scared of covid when it's killed less people than doctors do in error every year.  I might have it in my throat.  I'll find out Wednesday.  I'd rather have covid.
All true
Song so deep and emotional😫, I love you Tom 💖😓
"I swear there's a cure but they refuse to make it" !!!! RU Kidding me? I'm not surprised actually since this dude doesn't look like he reads a lick but you would think he would do some research before making such a claim. There isn't just one type of cancer meaning that the treatment for breast cancer is TOTALLY different than the treatment for bone or blood cancer or skin cancer. TOTALLY DIFFERENT! There's isn't nor there would be JUST ONE cure for cancer since they are all treated so differently. Some cancers have very high survival rates like over 80% and some like pancreatic cancer isn't very good at all...People please don't fall for this conspiracy theory way of thinking it makes you look stupid because the whole notion of conspiracy theories are stupid. It took just ONE person to break the Bill Clinton / Lewinsky thing and for example for the whole 'fake moon landing' conspiracy theory to be true it would've taken nearly half a million people to be COMPLETELY silent about the ruse to this very day and if you know anything about people...well that's NEVER gonna happen!  First off within a short time someones gonna think "If I don't write a book about it someone else will" or they will tell their wife, friends, children etc and the word would get around quick.
Very emotional 😭, but good video
I like tom a lot and his music, but not everything is a conspirancy, the world is not only usa...
Love it a LOT Nova!!!  Awesome J O B
wow, this song is amazing tom. thanks for this man
Thankyou for this song 6x types of cancer 5x fighting. Ill never stop fighting.
Breath taking!!
my mom passed away so suddenly last year because of cancer and heart failure, she's had to many disease and we was shocked when we found out she has cancer
My mom has stage 4 colon cancer and spots on her lungs. It shrunk and they did surgery and now she has a colostomy bag and another one for her bladder. After the surgery they said she was good and they were gonna get the spots on her lungs. It just came back on the first year anniversary of her diagnosis which wad my birthday in july. Shes now going through a different form of chemo. Shes been in and out of the hospital 2 or 3 times since for other complications due to it. I hope she pulls through. I love you Tom. Keep doing what you're doing.
I see little mention that cannnabis cures many types of cancer for many people, with little to no side effects, and can be grown in your back yard or living room. Not sure if people here aren't aware of this, or if there's cen5orship in this comment section. Either way, please research that if you aren't aware. I have several videos on it if you need a starting point.
Love this song..your amazing an a inspiration
Prayers to everyone who has been personally affected by this horrible illness. You are loved, you are not forgotten, stay strong.  "You burn brighter in the dark"
Jesus is coming for His people, repent. For God’s Kingdom is at stake.
I love this song. P.s this made me cry
Respect.
Thank you
Man.. you do great work , much respect from Germany - keep going
💪🏽🙌🏽🙏🏽🤲🏽✊🏽💋
Wow Tom I have listened to this like 50 time. I just lost my grandma to cancer and with everything going on we were not allowed to see her when she was at her worst. I wish I could just repeat all theses words to her.   Tom macDonald I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart and my soul. I think you just gave me so closure. Thank you  Don’t for get that you are amazing man and we all love you man. X
jesus how do people listen to this C R I N G E
My dad died on Monday, cancer has taken so much from everyone, knowing how much he suffered while doctors just passed him around while he slowly starved to death, as the cancer made it impossible for him to eat
my grandpa died before I got to see him.....That is why my middle name is named after him my name is “Ava JO cooper”
I lost my son to cancer this song is truth. Thank you for saying whats on your mind and heart.
All his hooks sound the same and are equally awful.
I have had the fortune to never experience a loss at the age of 18. But I know nearly 20 people with a cancer of some type. Some of them HAVE beaten but most of them have been told they can't. To those who have lost someone to cancer I am so sorry for your loss. May your friends and family enjoy eternal youth and happiness on their life after this. And may you see them again some day
Damn dawg, just had me thinking about my grand mother, cancer took her from us, thank you Tom.
Most emotionally provoking track I've heard in a long ass time. HOG forever
Don’t have cancer but i have a genetic chronic illness that’s fucked me up. I’m on 12.5 pills a day and i’m only 16. There’s no cure and no one cares enough about treatment because i can still live a long life. A life full of medical bills, pain, and more medications. It only gets worse and all doctors can do is medicate me for each of my symptoms when a new one comes up. This song hits close to home  even if it ain’t for the intended purpose.
The cure is simple just eat a specie specific diet and you reduce the chances of getting cancer and any other diseases.
Beautiful song brother
https://youtu.be/GOmzctNx7vo
they would rather profit than release the cure
My mom had stage 4 cancer, lost alot of things. Damn near almost everything. Put me and my sister in a horrible position to be raised under no money at all. But just like us and alot of other families out there, we are strong. Over a LONG time of fighting everything she pulled through, is back working again, and more amazing than she was when she got it. Its a brutal experience and i wouldnt wish even watching it happen to someone you love on my worst enemy. Love all of yall, please stay safe out here. Its HOG 4EVER🖤❤🙏 Also Tom & Nova, My family loves you guys and we couldnt get through this without reliving moments my mom showed really how fuckin strong she is. So youve more than done your job, nobody... And i mean NOBODY could get through this without shedding a tear, witness it yourself or not. Another amazing video and song. Amazing. Love you guys. 🖤🖤❤❤🙏🕊
Enough to make a grown man cry
Damn Tom I have watched this video and every reaction to it several times and cry every time but I can't stop watching it. I have lost my mom,dad, momo, pawpaw and numerous aunts and uncles and have shed more tears today than with all those deaths combined. You are definitely next level my friend. Thank you for all you do for us. #Hogfam4life
Is the sole purpose of the song just to talk about how cancer sucks? Very insightful
54k likes who are caring and 937 dislikes who are heartless
Thank you tom your awesome man me being a survivor of cancer this hit home bro
love this message as a cancer survivor...   but why is the hook so horrible
Keep pumpin the truth into our collective mind, Tom we love you and we need you Dawg!
My dad, Michael Joseph Doerr, lung cancer. We uses to call it the "c word". 20 years this Halloween & 420 in the evening, his favorite holiday. Imagine that. Yo, if you got to go through it just know they're never completely gone. Memory for me of an incredible man lives on. Tom Macdonald, this was the day my girl's dad died too. Today. Same thing. You've got some incredible timing. She sits here saying "thank you" to me for introducing her to your music. I say to her.... Hang, thank this man who is coming up fur to this real shit he speaks of. Sorry so long. You touched us both. ✌💙🙏 from two FL girls.
Full Spectrum CBD my friends. You or a love one has it look in to CBD.  It may help.  I've seen miracles!
He died in the end of June he is also mentally ill so I am I it's a struggle but I get through it I'm strong like him but still grieving still sad and depressed but sense I been listing to u it helps ease the pain
Awesome song!!!
Honestly,  Tom McDonald is on point with everything he has produced.  Keep pumping it out brother!
I lost my dad to pancreatic cancer he was only 46
Tears in my eyes 😢!!!!! Absolute fire 🔥
He's so woke
You are Strong✊❤
You always speak the truth man!  Respect :)  I lost my sister in 2018 to Pancreatic cancer at the age of 40.  RIP My Jenny♥
Cancer took my mom..she was the fighter, our rock, what kept us together...I miss her so much. Thank you for recognizing the pain so many go through. It also brought back some of the best memories of her..brought a tear and a smile to my heart. Thank you Tom...

I lost my grandpa too cancer when I was 14. He was my first and most important father figure.  It changed me and my path in life I'm sure if it.  😥
Beautiful song Tom ♥️😢
Tears in my eyes
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow.
If you disliked this song you are probably gonna get cancer💯💯💯
My grandfather had cancer for many years until the end almost 5 years ago he was one of my role models in life... And my stepdad was diagnosed with cancer and thank God he beat it so just wanna say I love this song
I respect him for making this
I just lost my Dad to this, the emperor of all maladies, a week ago today. He had a successful fight with lung cancer but was left on oxygen as a result due to reduced lung capacity. Three years after being declared cancer free he went in for a check up and the images of his chest showed the lymph nodes had tumors. Not long after that he was told  he would have about 3 to 10 months. One evening they were talking with his granddaughter over the phone (this was both of their 2nd marriage) about something she wanted to do with him and he said that they would have 3 months to get that done. To which my mom said no you'll have 10 months to do it. Later that night Dad confessed to mom that he really only felt like 3 months. That was just about 13 weeks ago so, he knew. I'm so fortunate. I got to have two dads who cared for me, loved me, counselled and corrected me, alive at the same time and I wasn't ready for that to end but I'm not so selfish as to pray for more time because I know that would only have prolonged his suffering. But I sure do miss him. Thanks Tom, that was beautiful. Thanks Nova, the video was powerful.
This song cuts deep we all know someone that has either gone through this and won the battle or fought till the bitter end. Much love to all that has gone through this or knows someone who has gone through this.
There's no money in a cure. Treatment and research get so much that they'll never release.a cute for fear they'll lose that income. Sad
To every 918 people that disliked this video must have never lost someone they love or someone close to them bc this song is amazing Elon every way thank you so much Tom can I please get a like or a comment so Ik u seen this!!
Love ur songs. Thanku for mAking this one.  It hits home. All my fam in Canada have some form.of cancer n my mum been diagnosed in nz with it. And now the rest us are dealing with the fact we could too.  Ur angel and I wish u the best.  I cant explain how much ur words are needed. Please keep it up. Love you heaps from goldenbay new Zealand
Im glad this song speaks out for alotah people that doesn't know half population that's struggling with cancer .. tom thanks for this 💎 you rock .. you and nova ♥️
Why tf this shit in my feed
My grandma I cancer and she die when I as 2 I thank about her ever day.and it hurts that I will never see her again
Thank you for this song.
This is beautiful  and heartbreaking. Lost a few people to this biggest heart break being my grandma. She wasnt even 60.
I couldn't see to type a comment from crying. Very deep song!
Dear jesus christ Im not afraid of this life..  Im only afraid of what comes after🥀
You are so beautiful in so many ways. The words you write are spot-on. 59 years old and I  like rap imagine that. My nephew showed me a video of you and I'm sincerely hooked , line and sinker!!!
Leaf 🌿🌿🌿 you should end it with. A resounding RSO... Like hope im the end of such a sad  song 😭🌿🌿🌿
Thanks for this wonderful song.  My father just found out he has cancer.  I am sharing this to him.
I was turned on to your music by Artofkickz...you have some great meaningful songs!  Keep up the great work
Damnit Man in full tears here
Big pharma, hang your heads in shame !!
Damn... this one... hit me hard... love it.
I know they all die my ex is not thanks lucifer shr is dtill alive i hope she will long more liveing..
Listen.
One of the best songs you’ve made! So beautiful!!!
Damn, man. You really went deep with this one. Watching the video and reading the comments has me choked up. My mom had ovarian cancer and beat it, but other than that my family has been fortunate and no cancer. My wife's dad had colon cancer and has been in remission for quite a few years, but they think he might have a rare blood cancer now. You just have to live your best life and care for one another when it gets tough. I'm sure it's really lonely expecting the worst.
😭😭😭So cute and made me cry😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Les go tom
I felt every word.. wont lie I was in tears before I even realized it... love you brother.. you are the only rapper that inspires me every single day .... HANGOVER GANG for life
Praying for all of those with this evil illness cancer! Stay strong!
Loss is never easy, we all lost people we shouldn't have... To anyone dealing with loss, namaste, love and respect
Damn this is deep😭
Microwave cellphones we are subjects
Wasn’t expecting that.  My mom is 67 and is going through chemo now. Prayers that it removes what wasn’t taken out from the surgery.
No words just wow. Tired of this world. Wish people cared about the people. We could all thrive together ❤  imagine the things we could accomplish as humans if we didn't hate, or we weren't selfish. Much love bro

My mom kicked cancer right in the dick after trying to save my uncle that had bone marrow cancer it has to be hadest thing to sign a DNR  to go above your own bed we ended up loosing my uncle then found out my mom had cancer through her body and she kicked it’s ass
Dude people want you to go on Tim Pool’s podcast

Amen!!
Dude, Tom, my man...you are so successful in putting out the hard and exact thoughts many of us have. You’re brave bro. Thank you.

The earth is flat and frogs are gay.
Had non-hodgkin's lymphoma in third grade it really is every were , great song bro crushing with the music as always tom.
This hits hard, as I have a friend currently fighting this fucking disease
This hit different
Tom macdonald is the man. Really feel every one of his songs.
Love this song Tom. At 11 I was diagnosed with brain cancer.  It’s benign but it’s the location of my tumor that causes it to be treated like cancer. My tumor is in the the medulla of brain. When found was on brain stem and went in the medulla as well as down the spine. I was given 6 months to live after surgery. I’m 29 now. Back then i went through chemo and radiation. And along the years long term happens and other things are diagnosed. A fighter is definitely one we are for sure. ❤️
This hits hard right in the feels
Well I'm 14 hours late cause I was working. But goddamn man. You guys did it again. Great video nova!! And great lyrics. You guys rock!
😥😪😭sad song.
Damm Tom that is one heavy song you hit the nail on the head with this one good job
Came into your music by an accident,so far the best accident in my life♠
I've had cancer 3 times already started at the age of 18 with breast cancer. Then I got ovarian cancer three years later and breast cancer again soon after. Now I have my fourth battle with it. This time it's brain cancer. Thank God my three sons are grown up and married. I have three beautiful grandchildren now two are 3 and the little girl is 2. I think this is why God wanted me to start my family early I got married very young. I have no regrets about it at all. Not even cancer. It's made me who I am. I don't want to leave my family. I don't because all they have is their stepfather here. I do want to tell everyone to not waste time on hating one another. Life is too short. Also, I want you to know I've been depressed most of my life. For many reasons. But always remember tomorrow is another day and the day starts over again. You can make it turn out awesome. Just smile and let the negative emotions go. God bless.❤️🙏🏽❤️
For the people who disliked this video I have just one thing to say to you. Go to hell! This song meant so much to me, and was perfectly timed. My grandma recently got diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma and even after treatments we have been told she will only live an extra 5 years. She was extremely healthy before hand and this caught us all by surprise. Tom I just want to say to you, thank you for this. It is a blessing to hear this and we both thank you more than you could ever know!
Absolutely love this song bro!!! My mother is a stage 4 Breast cancer survivor. She fought it for 6 years and has been a survivor for 10 years. She is so susceptible to any sickness if she gets too sick she could die. She’s my one and only hero. And my 10 year old nephew is battling brain cancer right now for the 2nd time he has already beat it once but this time it has spread to his elbows and legs and back. I respect you so much for making this song man!!! I’m gonna suggest it to everyone I know. Keep up the amazing work!!❤️❤️
Bro thanks for the never ending great music.  You’re about all I listen to lately.  🔥
I lost my grandmother just last week. She was diagnosed with lung cancer september 4th. A month later, even though she was full of joy and smiles that day, we had to call an ambulance because she became short of breathe. When the ambulance brought her to the hospital that day, I planted in my head that tomorow she would be home safe and sound, little did i know that "tomorrow" id visit her in the hospital right before she took her last breathe. Rip grandma and all our lost loved ones❤
I felt this my grandma had breast cancer lucky she made it out and got thorough it. It was tough but we made it. This song made me feel so many emotions but it was great. Thank you Tom. #Hangover gang forever
You wanna cry?.. this is how you fucking cry... GREAT fucking song brother.. I can't stop listening, and can't stop fucking crying....

Miss you gramps.  Love you man!
Controversy rapper who always reveals the truth 🤣🤣🤣
Thank you for your art ❤️
I love you and your girlfriend for this song even more it is my reality losing my mom 3 years ago and have many family members who lost there life
My mom..All i can choke out. 10 years ..still hurts like hell. Was with her till the end. Watched bodybag take her and watched the cremation. She wanted me to. Hard as fuk. Thanks for this song. She was a nurse and said EVERYTHING you said.
Who's  here before million  views.....✋
Why do I always hear uour songs ss an ad first lol
Amazing song and message
Honestly. I would gladly trade my life for any of them... With a giant smile on my face. In fact I'll now add that to my prayers. To take healthy burdens from my loved ones.
My mom passed October 2nd 2017 rest in heaven mama Lisha Zuniga. Ovarian cancer and MDS leukemia from the treatment uhhhhhh this hits home. My warrior fighter I pray for all those still fighting you are survivors.
I'll never forget the last thing I saw my great-grandad do after he had been fighting with lung cancer for a few months. This man who looked so frail and weak when I helped carry him to his bed; smiled up at me so wide and brilliantly and mouthed, "I love you". at me over and over again. He passed away overnight that night. Great video Tom, made me cry. 👍🏻❤
My Beautiful Mother was diagnosed with Ovarian and it was a long hard fight that she went through for over 5yrs before she was unfortunately taken from me and the rest of the world.😭😭😭 Only thing that got me through is knowing she Would NEVER HURT OR FEEL PAIN AGAIN. (But I will never feel her touch) 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
WOW!!! This is not at all what I expected but I absolutely love it!!! This song is beautiful and hits ya right in the feels and as always Tom doesn't hold back and tells it like it really is!!!
John 3:16-21 - "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. 19This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. 21But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God."
I don't think there are cure for cancer. I think cancer can be cured by very dedicated and professional doctors. If the doctor is eager to help them out, and ready to spend days just to cure one, I think it's possible. But there are way too many people with cancers.
Hello my name is Jovan Gulevsski and i come from North Macedonia and i have a condition called Synostosis radioulnar and I need to go to Viena for treatment so if anyone can donate me any amount it would mean the world to me (in case u doubt me go to my channel and check my synostosis radunlar vid) ty from bottom of my heart have a nice day
I'm a 3 time cancer survivor and I love this song. Keep up the great work
Thank you
This is so spot on . Thank you so uch for hearing us and singing my world.
This was a hard watch.  I've lost 2 grandparents from cancer and had my own fight with it. Keep fighting to all who get it and godspeed.
Mate I just beat tongue cancer.   Love your music brother.   I have for some time. But this one bro.  It hit home.  Deep.      Much love from Australia my man.

SHIT this is the truth! NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS!
👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 #awesomeness my friend! Thank you! Lost my mom in March 2013 to squamous cell carcinoma (lung cancer).. And many friends & family. Thanks for the truth about what it (cancer charities & research) is .. #greed
YO TOM DAWG WHY YOU GOTTA MAKE ME CRY
Damn so this really came out the moment my mom got a call that her cousin died from breast cancer.
Thank you for this. As a cancer survivor i can very much relate, i still get chills just thinking about the smell and feeling of the poison entering my blood... Being 26 at the time, with a 10 month old baby, living together with my girlfriend in a house that was halfway refurbished - the fear of leaving them behind was the worst for me... Been cancer free for almost 3,5 years now! I'm so glad i live in Norway - all health care is basically free here. Stay strong everyone, live every day to the fullest, enjoy the little things, give everyone around your love - thats all that matters in the end!
At this point there is 852 dislikes on this video = 852 people that are sick in the head
Oh my fucking god Tom you fuckin out did yourself here baby. AMAZING VIDEO AND LYRICS!!!!
How on point he is. The system is broken. www.thetruthaboutcancer.com  for anyone who wants information.
this is the one song I prayed would be made in to a video. And you and Nova delivered it masterfully, I can;t help but to be so very proud of both of you anytime but its especially strong right now. I cried through it when I heard it on the album and again through the video. Touched me so deeply.  This one is very special. its going to touch so many people out here, facing it down. God bless you and the fight, spirit and comfort you bring . 💝
Bro this hits different
Such an emotional yet motivational song, just beautiful. Tom keeps out doing himself again and again. HOG for life
Like many people, cancer has touched my family many times. I appreciate you bringing awareness to this all too common, yet somewhat preventable, disease. Just eating a different diet can mean the difference between life and death. Just something to think about. 🌱
Literally 2 weeks away from going thru stem cell transplant with my dad who has multiple myeloma. This hit hard af brother thank you.
This is the reality of millions around the world. May Tom's music brings to all some piece of mind. Thanks Tom for such master piece!
850 people who probably shouldn't be alive .
This song is so weird
Damn Tom. I wasn't expecting for this song to hit as hard as it did. But man. I love it
I didn’t have cancer but a birth defect that should have killed me doctors said I would die at the age of five I was one of the first in the world to have the surgery I had at the time I had it much more common now and the surgery is much better these days I have had and lived for thirty one years with Arnold Chiari malformation type 1 had the surgery at three years old and the outcome was uncertain but I fought and was in pain constantly I remember screaming in pain having migraines holding my head. Just keep fighting just know you aren’t alone I never have had cancer and pray I never do but people are stronger than they could ever realize
watching your video gives me cancer
All I want to do is to see u before I go :( ∆
This song means so much. Just this year I lost 1 aunt to cancer, have 1 other diagnosed and my mother recently got diagnosed with brest cancer. My husbands aunt is fighting it also. Cancer is a horrible disease, I agree there has to be a cure it's about the money. Someday hopfully they will give out the cure.
Holy shit Tom, you set your own bar higher again.  This one got me swaying back and forth while mixing some complex emotions and thoughts at the same time. I started out as a hater when I first heard your music. I apologize for not understanding then what it is your working towards. Now every time you release something new I'm rushing to get it on my screen. This was a heavy one and I really hope to see this song excel. I'll be here watching you take your place. H.O.G.
My grandma died of cancer and my dads had it twice. It'll be my turn soon
I am indian and I compare him with kr$na..
Lost my grandma july 9 at 2:55 am..i got the call at 4am....a voice just said " branden....." and i knew....i fell apart instantly...ive still not accepted that its happened....its just so crazy....  For all of those who can relate. Im sorry i feel it....  #FuckCancer
Wow!!! Such a strong message and so true. I have lost my uncle and my cousin to cancer. My mom faught breast cancer. One of my best friends has stage 4 lung and brain cancer. Sooo tough to see the ones you love suffer... I hate the system we live in nothing but making money off suffering!!!  FU#K CANCER !!!!!!!!!!!
Another great song w a msg, mad love bro. Keep up the fight for knowledge & understanding
So true mom just beat stage 4 cervical cancer in Jan now yesterday hear my grandmothers sister has kidney and liver 3 tumors found. I cry as I write this cause though the fight was over but it's now round 6 for our family so far 3 out of the five has beat it the other 2 didn't make it. So thanks for this song really helped me to get up this morning.
My mom died of cancer a week after my 16th birthday, this hit home. I watched a woman completely deteriorate from the drugs they put her on and the chemo she had to do. Always had long thick indian hair and lost it all. Thank you 💜
My mum just died from that SHIT. 20/09/20. My wife and l watched her suffer to the end. 😭😭
I'll keep this song on standby for when my time to fight comes. My father is the only cancer survivor yet in my family and I've been to more funerals than I can or care to remember. Just lost my uncle to cancer last week, so this song really hits home and I think it also highlights something that's very much overlooked in our society these days. Cancer is still very prevalent and we need to fight harder than ever to make sure we eradicate this thing once and for all! Thanks for bringing awareness back to this topic that seems to have taken the back burner to everything else in the world lately! Love ya bro! Keep up the great work!!!
Soursop fruit instead of chemo...   10k times more effective ..  doesn’t kill rest of body...  no. Money In It so they don’t pursue it.
Problem with cancer is it is your very own cells which mutate naturally. This stops your immune system or medicines from identifying the 'bad cells.' Chemo helps just nuke an area hoping to kill the ones spreading it but it's shotgun blasting into a crowd hoping you'll exterminate only the bad guys... while the good ones are just part of the casualties. This is why there's no cure.
My mom died to Cancer February 18th 2016...
There is no cure to Cancer because cancer is not a disease, its a condition. To cure cancer would be cure aging. Aging is biologically a form of cancer. I don't expect a cure for death by old age, therefore I do not expect a cure for cancer, only treatments.
REAL!!!! NEED THIS!!!!  BEAUTIFUL
No amount of money makes up for good health.....this is now my personal anthem song.......I have a brain tumour and have fought for over 6.5years to get it fixed.....I finally found a Neurosurgeon who will operate......and it's going to be AUD$26000.......plus.......I lost my younger cousin to ovarian cancer...........I have listened to the song and words a number of times now.....and I have cried....bawled my eyes out each time........top fan....Lisa
Thank you for this song Tom. I was adopted when i was 4 and i never met my father, but when i finally re-united with my biological mother about 10 years ago, i found out that my father had stage 4 cancer and i still don't know if he is alive. I also recently found out that my biological mother has been fighting cervical cancer for a while now. I wasn't really that close with her, but this song has made me want to. I appreciate your music even more now.
Just when I think there's not a topic left for you to speak the truth about you write  another poem that touches peoples souls...your an amazing being Tom MacDonald
Like I've said before I jumped to a conclusion that was wrong you speak the truth  and I have had many that past away
Thank you!!!!  I have lost too many loved ones to cancer and this just made me smile. Great song terrible disease...FUC CANCER!!!!
Im speechless damn dude
This video made me almost cry because I lost my father to lung cancer on my tenth birthday
You’re songs are so close my life. My mom passed from cancer and we wondered if the chemo/radiation sped it up.. and your song sober.  Man I’m one your new biggest fans in certain songs.
This shit speaks volumes man. Even something like depression can be cancerous, and that is something I struggle with daily. This song makes me keep going, and I am going to share it with another friend of mine who is going through the same shit I am. Keep up the great work Tom, we love ya. HOG for life
Wow definitely hit home watching my mom fight cancer for a yr now and it's not easy thank u sir for this one
My boyfriend's mom actually passed away from bone cancer & they think his grandpa might have it too. I'm praying for the best for him.
My sister just lost her boyfriend to cancer a couple weeks ago
This shit hit hard. I am the 40% Imagine telling both your parents that their child might die before them. Thankfully I beat it, but those months were literal torture both emotionally and physically.
I wish I made this. Thank you! 😭😭😭💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼❤️❤️❤️🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼👨🏼‍🦲
How could anyone give this a thumbs down 🥺
Tom just might be able to save this generation
C'mon man ! Do you ever stop being awesome? Great song dude. Was worth the wait.
It funny how the government controls the things that kill us and save us . However they don't care about the grey area of living !  Good video good song
You are a true inspiration for hope
I had cancer. I remember writing goodbye letters to my family and friends the night before my surgery... this one hit so deep.
Dam man you have touched me in place that I thought was gone thank you man
Anyone reading this who’s afflicted, keep fighting; you are a soldier! 🖤
This song is amazing. I wish it had been out during my battle, but I got through it. I beat it and I am 7 years out! I lost my grandma to cancer when I was young and my best friend lost her husband last year. It seems we all know someone who has it or had it. They're killing us off and all we can do is sit back and argue over race and religion and politics. We are not the enemy, they are
The young lady is beautiful and I'm praying for her if she does have it. Much respect Tom. Amazing track. Fuck Cancer.
im 14 and this is deep
Every time I listen to this song it reminds me of my dad, he passed in 2013 from cancer he is my hero.  Thank you.  Thank you for being selfless and open and brutally fing honest.
They have the cure but they don't care about the people, only the money
Bro im trying see what Nova can do with that 'Fools Gold' thats my favorite track on that album at the moment..can put any of ur albums on n let play song for song n jus chill n vibe out no matter what im dealin wit bro keep doin ur thang man ur changing lives
We're all in the same game just different levels dealing with the same hell just different devils
Dope. Tom ur the real. Let ur stars shine bright. I think ur amazing dude. For real.
804 dislikes on an uplifting song...really?
My dad was finally diagnosed with a very aggressive form of cancer of the plasma the day before he passed away. He was sick for about a month and fought tooth and nail to get better. No one was able to give us answers until it was too late. All he wanted was to come home and I begged him to keep fighting. He tried so hard to hold on. It's been 2 months since he passed and it feels like half of my heart is missing, hes everything to me. Both my aunt and uncle also were diagnosed with cancer of the plasma however their's isn't as aggressive and they are currently in hospice. My aunt has been fighting the last 2 years and my uncle is trying to keep on going. Cancer fucking sucks. I wish they had cures.
To the ones battling.  My thoughts and prayers are with you.  You're amazing fight hard. ❤❤❤
Great job talking about the tough topics nobody wants to sing / rap about

We just lost my father n law to cancer, this song broke us down but means so much. Thank you for making it. So much respect to this song. Thank you.
My wife got sick right after our wedding, it wasn’t cancer but endometriosis.  Three years and 6 surgeries later she is finally better.  But we paid a price for her health.  This song hits me because of the nights in hospitals when we should’ve been on our honeymoon.  You burn brightest in the dark, this is so true.  Thank you Tom.
This hit hard. My mamma just had surgery and her cancer is gone. Been a fan since the beginning. Thank you for all your truths and everything. All my love to you. 💜
1:21 God sends his strongest soldiers through hell to get to heaven.
I ain’t ever heard of McDonald, but this man has some some range in the type of music he makes. Respect
I lost my grandpal back in 2018 because of cancer he had colon cancer he beat it once back in 2017 and it came back in 2018 and killed him my grandpa was like my dad to me 2018 and 2019 I suffer from depression I watched him die I tried ending my life because he was my roll molded and I didn't really have any one after he die so I try to overdosed and drink myself to death so I could be with him I miss him alot I'm doing better now I quit drinking and taking pills and I got the help I needed
Dude, that's an amazingly good song. Thank you for being you
FELT THIS SO MUCH. CRYING. R.I.H MOMMY. 🥺🥺🥺🥺🙏🙏🙏
0:48 Most of us have our own ideas. There are actually 5 big afterlife theories out there on the internet. If you search for it on Youtube or Google. You'll know what all 5 of them are.
Man this song is perfect man. I don't know what to say but I'm touched.
Tom , you absolutely blow my mind with each and every video you post. You just don’t sing to make money you sing from the heart 💓 it’s not just empty words, You and nova have come so far together in ur journey Hold ur head high . Your music has helped me through some very dark times , and for that I THANK YOU 🙏 MAD RESPECT ✊
I lost my dad in 2002 when I was 15. He worked for the government since he was 17 years old. They made him sick as well as several thousand others, they knew it and tried to cover it up.  His federal insurance wouldn’t cover pills to combat nausea that cost $600 per pill.  I watched the strongest person I knew turn to skin and bones over the course of three months from the poisons they were putting in him.  I’ve made the decision that if this were to happen to me I wouldn’t accept any treatment.
Miss you Mom..
My mother has been battling lung cancer for 2 years. It's been a real struggle. I really appreciate you making this song Tom.
My father was diagnosed 2 days before hid 52 birthday,  asbestos.........he died 6 weeks later.  He cried for the first time,  told me he loved me for the first time and we were never closer.  I miss him everyday.....everyday.
My mom passed from cancer when I was 9. 🥺
For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in our Lord Jesus Christ
0:34 we give everything we have to just stick around another second , give a fortune to doctors who promise they could extend it ... danmmm
**SO TRUE 👍 KEEP UP THE REALLL RAPP BROTHA!
Best ARTIST period!! You bro are a Godsend bc you give hope to sooooo many people going through tough times!!! Bless You, Nova and everyone helping you get these messages out to the world!! RESPECT!!!
Thanks man this song just kicked my heart to thrive for my battle with bladder cancer it's a real pain In the dick. Lol Since 2015 I gave up my fight when my fience left me during my treatments she wasnt strong enough it wrecked us financially mentally destroyed me to where I gave up my fight I was wanting the demons to win I Let it brew I wanted to die. I was a great family man awesome father I still am but I thought I wasn't. Until January 2020 I was rushed to the hospital with my hemoglobin at 3 I was a walking dead man my fuse already expired. They got me back after 2 weeks of blood transfusions abunch of surgeries I was in the hospital until mid I left there with a nephrastomy tube out my back to open my kidney up so it would drain again this was all going to get taken out march 19 the china virus shut it all down I was left with this device out my back until may 21 and only then nothing to do with the problem they just removed the tube all the rona excuses blah blah my kidney needed to come out in reality but they couldn't. I literally wanted to give up again finally not until last week I got my kidney removed to stop the cancer from growing in my bladder and this song just totally made me want to fight forever. sorry for the rambling if you even get to see this im sure you get it. Thanks a million
We have been paying them to kill ourselves.
my dad passed with liver cancer in 2018 he fought it for 15 years I was 13 then life is not easy
🖤🖤🖤
Thank You

Bro, your musik always catch me ;-;
God bless all
Really hit home amigo I know everyone has been touched by this thanks man!!! Repping Canada right!!!
Amazing that somebody could make their entire career off being a troll, but he releases a song about cancer and people actually buy it as being genuine and not another desperate attempt at attention.
Sa aura prouvé une chose...qu'il y a au moins 765 sans coeur qui ont vue la vidéo sans conté les hater qui hate pour le fun sans même prendre le temps d'écouté...domt la seul chose qui préoccupe est leurs petite personne
i lost my aunt and my grandmother to cancer we need a cure its so sad to lose the ones you love
The grandma on my moms side just got diagnosed with cancer like 1 2 or 3 months ago and then the other grandma on my dads side just passed away last month just 1 week away from her birthday
Much respect for Tom Macdonalds outlook on life!
Lost my dad to lung cancer which spread to his bones. Gonna have this on repeat. Appreciate the words.
Bro, I was gonna watch this earlier at my buddies house, but I knew I was gonna cry just because of the title. I'm laying in bed, and I decided to listen. I was right. I cried 😂 Honestly really fucking needed this song. Just found out yesterday that my grandfather has cancer. It's gonna be a wild ride. But I know we can all pull through. Thank you, Tom. I really do appreciate you as a person, and the music you make.
Only thing more cancerous than your music is your face
I absolutely Love your Faith and the Ray of light that you share with us❤

THC IS THE ANSWER
TRENDING
A theory my friends and i believe in is that there is a cure for cancer but it has been hidden. We can split atoms and send a man to the moon but can't cure a disease? There has probably been a cure found but they wont come out because there is too much money made on people with cancer
my papa recently died of cancer take this message FU( CANSER
This hits hard. Love it ❤❤
They have the cure for Cancer it has been proven. But all this big Pharmaceutical company wouldn't make money. Wouldn't be no Donation like Unicef and all this other companies that do fuck all but profit. Feel bad for all the people who have died from Cancer.
My mother is currently in remission....two weeks ago I lost my 18 year old cousin to cancer and ny neighbors 4 year old son was recently diagnosed with blood cancer 😔😭 #fuckcancer #strongertogether

The power of music is surreal . Music can change the world . You’ve utilized a platform to do just that with your hard work dedication an commitment . You’re a special man an humanity needs it . Hangover gang!!!!!
Tom that was a BEAUTIFUL song. That touched my heart 💖. You have a beautiful soul and great words thank you that song
I'm crying and I don't even have family, my best friend's dog has some troubling lumps at the moment though, the day she passes is the day me and him will cry and cry and cry.
This is a very special song ♥️♥️♥️ I feel like this song is going to touch the most hearts. Great job brother!!! We aways have room on team Jesus for you!! He's always there waiting at the door for you and loves you so much brother. Coming from a former atheist that loved heavy metal and music was my god. It took being homeless for me to believe in God. I pray you don't have to be that low in life to have an encounter with the living God. God bless brother!! Keep these banger songs coming!! 👊🔥🔥🔥
yep,i cried....
https://youtu.be/YG9lqYWVHiA le clip de lannee❤️❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾‼️‼️✊🏾
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
That was amazing to listen to & watch, fortunately iv not known anyone lived or lost with or had cancer but I see this helping alot of people tom. Your on a roll keep em coming please we need music that speaks truth & you among small group others are providing that so thank you.
Big hit
Someone with bowel cancer, this made me emotional. But I'm lucky it was detected very early and that it can be sorted most likely without radiation treatment. Fingers crossed 🤞 but even with it in the early stages, it's terrified me. Thank you for creating for a wonderful song. ❤️
Love seein the dude from White Boy make a comeback! Also the song is amazing!
Y don't you make a song about how THC cures cancer.
Wow. Pure truth. Mom dad , grandmas , grandpas , aunts , uncles , cousins all dead from cancer.  Don’t know one person who has died from convid.  Unreal.
did they not even bother hiding the bald cap? lololol
brilliant song brilliant message
I nearly lost my dad to colon cancer when I was only in the second grade. Thank for this song it reminded me of how at my dad's physical weakness from the treatment could not stop his iron will to proved for us.
I had ovarian cancer. They told me I would never have kids, that I would have to get everything removed. I couldn't afford it, my insurance wouldn't cover it. I dealt with the sickness and the pain for years. And now, it's in remission, and I have two sons ages 13 and 2.
This is spectacular Tom. Another number one hit.
If you are sick in mind or body and question the answers look to diet. The cure to cancer is to not consume poison and unlock your body and minds  ability to heal itself. The cancer is external and the cure is internal. Like tom beat addiction we all have choices to make in our own lives and health. Consume a pure diet both physically/nutritionally and spiritually, what you consume in mind and soul. We all walk a path of redemption what is your truth?
I lost my Mom to cancer, held her in my arms as she breathed her last. I felt a hole open in my chest, but I know I will see her again. I’m now fighting my own battle, but I know Jesus has a perfect home waiting with no sickness or tears, and know she will be there to greet me. Love to all.
Wow bro! I love to rag on you, but I think you're the first rapper I know of to touch on something like cancer. Hats off to you man. I hope you stay blessed.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I connect to this Song cause I recently Finished My Cancer Treatment and Cancer is Nothing To Joke About and I Aprove This Message  Thank You Tom
Fantastic... Such heart ... Just completed a yr of chemo, surgery and radiation...
You wrote a beautiful song ❤️ I didn't cry  but I'm not really a cryer for things anyway. Keep up the good work man. You touch many lives. Peace.
I'm pretty sure that the Cytotoxic T cell will eventually lead to the cure. It's a cell that is produced as an immune response and directly targets and kills cancerous cells. It's currently being used in mice to reduce the negative side effects of chemotherapy with stunning results. Ramping up the production of these cells in a patient's body should drastically improve the survival rate and the risk of side effects in chemo. It would be interesting to see what would happen if we could harvest them in mass and inject them directly into the infected areas, but that would require human testing, which is a pain in the ASS to get approval for.  I've lost 1 friend and 2 relatives to cancer. It isn't fun to watch someone go from a happy-go-lucky individual to a human husk in just a few months. Instead of donating to research, it would probably be better to donate to the reward for whoever comes out with the cure.
I was 17 when my mom was diagnosed with cancer. I watched it slowly consume her until her death when I was 18. Now, I am watching it do the same thing to my sister. Both of them smoked cigarettes and didn't have the best health to begin with. Severe stress, etc. It taught and is teaching me how important it is to do everything in our power to stay as healthy as we possibly can. Not only for our families or friends, but to send a big "fuck you" to the cancer industry that thrives on making us sick. To everyone who is or has been effected by cancer, my heart goes out to you. I know how those holes stay with you and never fully heal. The lessons you take from losing a loved one can help you grow into an amazing person if you let them. Stay strong ♡
Whoever disliked this song is simply a shity person. Keep making real music.
This hits home super bad for me...😭😍🖤 I absolutely LOVE IT!!💚💙💛💜🖤😍😻
talking about a "cure" for cancer is basically admitting you're dumber than the dirt you sleep in
Absolutely amazing bro. Thank you for this song!!!
This hits me hard my whole life my sister has been deaf and can’t talk because of cancer this song hits hard 😢
This video really hit me hard. My mom was doing with kidney cancer in 04. She's only has a third of a kidney. Now she's on dialysis because of it.. We almost lost her but she a fighter. She is the toughest lady I know. I love my momma ❤❤
I love you grandma....i miss you
Breast cancer specifically speaking of...There's to much money to stop the birth control wave.  Just try and counter with new drugs to treat the cancer.  MONEY BOTH WAYS
Tom that hit hard. Damn, That triggered alot feelings I wasn't ready to feel.
@ Tom MacDonald,  This Song really hit me, I am waiting on test results to find out if I have a form of Multiple Myeloma called Myeloedel Plastic Syndrome, a blood cancer, If I do then this will be my fight Song while I fight it. I beat bladder cancer 15 Months ago, so I know I can fight cancer again, and do all I can to beat it again. Thank You so much for this song and all of Your Music. keep Shining
❤ amazing
Valid points made in the beginning...
Always so good Tom
damn that really is a tearjerker! WELL DONE!!!! 👏___👏___👏__👏_👏_👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 VERY WELL DONE!!!!!!  brother i greatly appreciate your honesty. keep it comin!!!!!!!!
I've been a fan of yours for a while.  My dad has stage 4 cancer and this song is so very true to the struggles our family is going through. Thank you for your honest words
Thank you so much for doing this song. I have stage 4 bladder cancer that traveled to my chest. I'm on imminotherapy. I get it once every 3 weeks. I've gone through radiation and chemo and they both made me so sick. They gave me 12 months to live back in January of 2020. Hoping to beat it for my baby boy.
Can't explain how much I needed this. My mother in law has cancer a well as my uncle. Its been a nightmare of a ride and there are times I just feel like good people are being punished for no reason. Thank you for this song, Tom. I really needed this
Dope song & video Tom& Nova.  People player hating this need our prayers. There life must suck.
Love your work my friend
It was tough to get through this song
This is so powerful Tom....
I've lost many friends and family members to cancer.  I recently lost my older brother and best friend in July to a rare form of blood cancer.  I'm in tears.  He fought it for 7 years.  Thank you for this beautiful song.
I'm not crying you're crying. Damn Tom this hit a little different. I lost my grandpa  to cancer a few years ago and that was a major blow to me. I've got a couple of aunt's fighting currently and just thank you for this song brotha! Keep up the amazing work! You are awesome!
Tom, I am in a state of shock.  I could not even breathe right for 10 minutes, frozen in place barely able to type much less did not even realize the tears falling on my desk were coming from me.  Tom, the words you put together & sang, by far, went deeper inside my being than I can express in words.  I more understand now why you descended to the bottom of the barrel of life.  As an "elder" it's all clear to me now.  You have been given a very special mission Tom but, there would have been no way to accomplish this mission without going through all the trials & tribulations, traumas, addictions, a very deep depression time & time again, complete despair, loneliness, feelings of hopelessness, so much remorse & even utter contemplation of ending it all.  This mission, Tom, is actually a "gift".  A "gift" that is meant for you to become the "voice" for millions.  You are destined to save lives, bring the light back into millions of lives, help people to confront their fears, guide them to forge their own path in life, think for themselves, use their imagination in a positive & productive way, help those to re-discover their true "self-image" & confidence to cope with "life" through all its' ups & downs without losing themselves time & time again until the choice is death instead of life.  You are destined for greatness Tom, so be grateful for your past & all the pain since that will help guide you to touch the deepest spot of millions of us wanting to know true love & happiness within once again whether it be long or short!!  All your songs have had a message but, this one Tom, helped rescue millions & this is what you are meant to do.  To be "chosen" Tom, just know there's no greater "gift" to be given since it is the one thing that can not be bought with money ...... it is priceless!!!  Sending much love from my heart to you, Nova & "ALL" your precious pets!!!
Wow just wow man ur on a different level then all others
VITAMIN B 17 CURES CANCER!!!! MY VIDEO CLEMENTINA CURES AMERICA I GIVE CANCER CURES!!! YOUTUBE SEARCH IT!!!

Love this song so much. Two time testicular and got blessed with my son right before I found out
BOOM🎯🙏💯
Cancer took the only person i ever loved, and the only person in my family who loved me for who I am. My aunt Brenda, more of a mother to me than my own mom. She passed from cervical cancer in 2014 and it still hurts just as bad today as the night I lost her. Thanks for the song, Tom. Sincerely, a fan.
Thank you Tom! My Daddy passed with cancer and it sucked! I miss him every second of every day. 💔
dont cry
thanks tom. R.I.P.  N.L.Z.1994
Nice message but he is so cringe and his fan base is nerdy white guys who have no rhythm
Thank you for this. I wasn’t expecting you to hit so close to home ..

I took care of my mom for a whole year when she was diagnosed with a rare bone marrow disease it was 1 of the hardest things I had to do R.I.P. mom ❤🖤
Grandmother had breast cancer, grandfather had throat and skin cancer. This had years in my eyes so fast. Thank you for this
Tom you are one of the most truthful speaking artist on this platform and this song hit home man. Thank you for making such a positive song about fighting cancer cause I know what it’s like to lose family to this horrible illness and hope that this song give’s courage and faith to anyone with cancer to beat this battle and move on to what comes after.... 🙏 My prayers out to everyone fighting the battle with love peace and positivity..
My fam is riddled with it. I’m sure your making this in good faith, but I just have to know what is your personal inspiration? It seems like a money grab at face value without that. Everyone hates cancer.
Absolutely love this.
Love the song in the video such a great message keep it up Tom love the music

Speak It Tom! Always dope when u drop somethin. Aunt didnt lose her battle to breast cancer with death, but it put her in a depressed place like i never seen.

At the rate this song and your songs are growing you are bonded to break the internet completely one day tom if any thing good has came out of this year it's you and your amazing music
My dad was just told that he has stage 4 stomach cancer so this really got to me seeing someone you love slowly dying right in front of you is the worst thing and you can’t do nothing but watch it happen
My dads side of the family has had brain cancer for 7 generations and my dad is fighting it right now, the only time I ever saw him cry is when he was telling my sister and I broke down about 20 seconds into the video
My uncle billy was a huge fan of yours he passed away back in March of cancer and this song gave me chills and reminded me of him thank you for your music
Amen 🙏❤😥
Dear friends, there are COUNTLESS reasons to thank Jesus Christ.....including for who He is!  Sure, there are times when Father God, through Jesus Christ, intervenes in our lives in a tangible way, and we say something like, “Thank You, Lord, for allowing me to get that job.” But most often, we can simply say, “Thank You, God, for being who You are.”  That’s what’s behind verses like 1 Chronicles 16 : 34: “Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.” Thank You, God, for who You are—good and loving. And Psalm 7 : 17: “I will give thanks to the Lord because of his righteousness.”             Thank You, God, for who You are—the holy One. And “Let us come before him with thanksgiving...for the Lord is the great God” (Psalm 95 : 2–3). Thank You, God, for who You are—the Almighty God of the universe. Who Yahweh  (Father God) and our Savior Jesus is is reason enough for us to stop what we’re doing and give praise and thanks. Thank You, LORD for just being You!             Begin your life of thank our Lord in countless ways by first understanding that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Yeshua (Jesus Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be justified in salvation and blessed abundantly with love. Your life will be forever changed!                                                                   Please take a moment to pray the following prayer with me.....Thank You, dear Father God, for being who You are—the Almighty God who loves us and welcomes our love in return. Thank You for everything that makes You magnificent. We stand in awe of You as we praise You with word and song. This we pray in the Mighty name of Your Son, Jesus Christ, Amen! May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.❤️❤️❤️
THIS is why Tom is so good and deserve a lot more recognition. Man spits straight facts with zero care, every track he drops is true and factual. Respect Tom. Keep doing you.
Lost my father to lung cancer July 11th 2018. Rest in peace dad.
Liked, subbed and love your style. Keep it up and best wishes.
A true artist is able to provoke thought and emotions through their music and lyrics, Tom my guy, does it the best these days 💯
Humans gonna beg aliens to cure all diseases, then they'll turn yall into robots.

Best friend died of cancer last week attending his funeral tomorrow...fuc cancer ♋️
Thank you Tom & Nova. What a beautiful message! 🎗 Fuçk cancer!!
Grandmother died today of liver cancer ❤️
I lost my wife to cancer last year and this hit me hard.
You have probably heard this before but I still want to share it with you. I am a 63 year old female who really does not care for rap or hip hop or whatever it is called today. BUT, I heard "People so Stupid" and I loved it which led me to watch other videos of yours. I have to say that I am a fan now!! But this, this video/song, it is amazing!! It not only eludes to the reality of why cancer is still around after all these years but you also have touched on the emotional part and have given encouragement to anyone who listens. I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you!!
This song has so much meaning and I know it is tough at times and you want to  Quit or give up but there is light on the other side. You may be in darkness and be in pain but trust me you can make it though what ever it is. Just keep a positive attitude and keep your head up. I hope to whoever is reading this understands what I mean when I say you can do this. Yes there might be tears but no matter what you keep your head up and know GOD is on your side and he will never leave you. Not in the darkest of days and not in the brightest of the nights. So keep fighting and NEVER give up YOU ARE A FIGHTER.
Keep up with the amazing music man you are a real talent never forget that bro .
I lost my mother and grandmother. I ended up with it also brain cancer eventually but  turning to Christ saved me. Only lost about 15% of myself blessed.
Damn reading these stories is heart breaking.
Currently on my 2nd bout with colon cancer. Chemo treatments are kicking my ass right now. This song hit me deep. Thank you bro
Loved the song when I first heard it on the new album and this video just amplifies the feelings. Great job and thank you for this Tom and Nova!  #hangovergang4life
Let's be real they have the cure but like he said its a $100billion industry... Come on 40yrs+ still can't find a Cure!!???   Corona virus, diabetes,  cancer, ....  $ could it be???
only music video i could fined without haters
Hey I really love this song and its really touching that you would release it on the 34th anniversary of my grandmother's death October 16 1986
Man I wanna say thank you for this song. M aunt/ mother had breast cancer and I felt my whole world just fall. I spent every cent I had and tear I had to help her. After 3 years it was gone. But just writing this brings tears. She is my world... again thank you for this song....
My dad passed away from a very rare form of Brain cancer.  It was melanoma that had found its way to his brain. He never even had "skin cancer" scares or anything.  He passed in November of 2013 just under 3 months from his diagnosis.  Still miss him to this day and still feel his presence in this house from everything that was his and I see him sitting in his chair, at the table for Thanksgiving.  Even though he's not here anymore,  I see him everywhere,  not in a paranormal sense that is.
Thank you brought a tear my dad past 2yrs ago due to brain cancer
Another awesome song and video. Keep up the great work, my Wife and I love your music!
This man, as always, does not disappoint.  Tom is, as I have said before, one of the only genuine voices we have today.
My Mom fought a long 10 year battle with Cancer and other illness, she fought hard and bravely. The last time she was in the hospital she sore she would get better to walk the pier in Pismo Beach CA. once again. She made that walk but passed away shortly after. My Dad joined her 6 years later when he lost his battle with Cancer also. This song touched my heart, Thank You so Very Much... ❤
This song hots home for me. I lost my Uncle due to one of the most sever cancers there is. He had a huge lump on his back for years an one day decided to get it checked an the doctors just wanted to prob it an as soon as they did it spread too fast to even try an fight it. But they kept insisting probing it would help...😔😔  he was one hell of a great man. He believed in the simple ways of the lord. Never saw my dad cry ever till the day he lost his brother.
Wow... I lost my husband to that disease. I will never forget the hell he went through trying to fight but he just couldn't. I wish it was about our world and our people not corporate greed it's sad what's happening to our world..
Get this song to number 1 man
R.I.P WILBURN JR "PAPA"  BURRIS 2015 12 25 FOREVER IN MY HEART ❤ #USMCONCEAFIGHTERALWAYSAFIGHTER
Damn man I started to listen to the song  . Started to think about my mom who was diagnosed with cancer she got to see graduate high school  Rip 🙏 mom
Lost my mother 8 year's ago to cancer and not a single day goes by I don't think about her. I had to watch her wither away down to 50 lbs by the time the good lord took her home. Love and miss you mom! Thank you for this song Tom McDonald!
Amazing song! One of the best you’ve put out!
You can do it, I stand with you!
My husband and I both got cancer within weeks of each other in 2016. It was brutal. I was stage 3, and he was stage 4. I did my best to help take care of him because he was sicker. We went through radiation, chemotherapy, massive surgeries, and everything else that offers hope for a cure. My husband told me that one of us had to stick around so that we didn’t have to tell our children that they were losing both parents. Unfortunately, he passed away in 2018 and my heart has been broken since then. However, I do know that I will see him again. I do know that I will live in eternity because of Jesus. And it is that kind of hope that helps me get through the darkest times. I love your song Tom. Thank you for saying how we feel in such a beautiful way.
Always keeping it real my brother. This one goes out to my sister who is going thru treatments for a rare form of breast cancer right now. This one also goes out to our beloved family cat of 8 years “Monster” that just passed away this past Sunday from leukemia. RIP....and of course I gotta mention my Pops that I lost 20 years ago from prostate cancer and also my Grandma that I never got to meet, she passed away from leukemia the year before I was born. Sending everyone that has been affected by this tragedy lots of love and positive vibes. Stay strong.
Heaven is real. Don't @ me
I was smoking a cig when I seen this and half way through I threw it down and threw my pack away! I need to be here for my son and family! Keep up the videos man love you!
Wow Tom .I love how you make music that actually matters and has a strong positive msg. Your lyrics inspire and help alot of people.  Its just awesome how u dont hold back and speak the truth on every record. Keep up the great work. Thx for your music
That was beautiful Tom
Any one else feel stronger just from listening to this? Epic Tom. Thank you
Dude.  I just discovered you a couple weeks ago.  Your lyrics are FIRE!!!  The music, melody...I love it.  Keep bringing the truth the world needs to hear.
What is this bro- Cancer? Bro thats my Zodiac ♋️ bro- not trying to be rude!
I was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer, Multiple Myeloma in 2009 I went through 8 weeks of radiation, 9 rounds of chemo and 2 bone marrow transplants and my husband was with me through  all my treatments.   I have a low immune system it never fully recovered and the chemo left me with severe peripheral neuropathy I can't feel my toes and have constant pain so my mobility is effected and some days I'm in the wheel chair other days I use the my cane.  I have been a survivor and prayer warrior for 7 years and going strong as I can.   Thank you both for this song and video its really beautiful.  Just a little prayer:  Father God, we humbly pray for all those who are fighting cancer. Give them the hope and courage they need each day. Comfort them in their pain and bless them with healing. Strengthen their family, friends, and caregivers. In Jesus’ name, Amen. www.nursebuff.com/prayer-for-cancer-patients/

Bro, you're an incredible artist. I've been following you for longer than I can remember, infact probably since the beginning of your career, And I cannot think of a single song that I didn't enjoy or one that you have put out that you didn't put your whole heart and soul into. Mad fucking love for you Tom 💯 H.O.G FOREVER  I've been pretty tight on cash these past few months, but as soon as I get a little ahead I'm going to buy the gravestones CD hopefully autographed and definitely would like to have a hoodie.

OMG!!!! YOU HAVE COMPLETELY OUT DONE YOURSELF!!!! GOD BLESS YOU & NOVA❤🧡💛💚💙🙏🙏
🙏🔥
Father died at 51, stomach cancer. Wish he was alive to hear something like this.
I lost my brother and mom from it, this touched me🥺,
Wow!!!
Love it. Amazing message
not only health cancer  there is too exist a love cancer 😭😭
To the 678 people who dislike this, why?
Drops another good song
I feel this song is Dedicated to all those who have lost their fight and to all those who refuse to quit fighting.  Also to the close friends and family who are along for this horrible journey.  Thank you Tom and Nova for such a sensitive and emotional song that I'm sure means a lot to so many people including me and my family.  I'm very disappointed to see any dislikes on this song when it has such a profound and pure message it truly shows that there are some evil people amongst us. #F*CKCANCER
I lost my Great Aunt to cancer & I still miss her kindness & smile to this day, thanks Tom your a inspiration to me #RealTalk
I lost my grandpa to leukemia almost 5 years ago, he was the father figure in my life i didn't really have growing up, never knew my real-dad, step-dad wasn't that great to me growing up, seeing him have to go through chemo, and how tired he was after he got home. to see him slowly get worse and worse as time progressed, i carry the final nail he ever put in a wall with me because that was just how strong he was, he wasn't willing to give up, even doing something as far as putting something up on the wall for me even though he didn't really feel like it. This song hits home and hard, but i thank you for it.
YUP keep it up Tom you touched the souls of many people and the ones that are yet to hear
Run it up!
Man....someones cutting onions in the comment section, had to dip out 😢😭
To whomever has disliked this video, what is your problem? He tryna help and your trying to discourage him?? If it’s because his looks those don’t matter, what does matter are his intentions. Thank Tom MacDonald for this beautiful song.
So twenty percent of folks will die of cancer yet they have your kids banned from school and small businesses shuttered and everyone wearing slave masks because of a flu virus that kills one hundredth of one percent of the population.
Wow this song is iincredible! The vocals the filming...bravo Nova  And Tom this is so emotionally brilliant thank you!!!
Good message but Tom Macdonald is so whack as a rapper
Man I said the same thing 90 million for cancer research and you telling me there is no cure yet
This guy speaks the truth, and Trump2020
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️
Wow this is an amazing song thank you Tom!
TRENDANNNGGGGG
668 dislikes? You really have to hate tom or really have no heart.
The reason cancer doesn't have a cure is because there are so many variations on it. It's not figuring out how to cure 1 disease, but thousands. There are forms of cancer we have effectively cured. There are just so many more that we haven't.
Thanks for releasing this! I don't know if you know but I asked a while ago in a comment that this song needed released. I'm so glad you didn't take my advice and just release the audio. This video is amazing 😍👍 🔥 🔥
Hm hm.....👀👀 Why the fuck does he get to be sooo Smart!
Dang man what a timing for this song!!! My mom just died at home this Wednesday morning at 7am from CANCER 6years!!! But I do know when we die it's either heaven or hell!!! When my mom was in the valley of the shadow of death (The start of this week) she saw the Angel of death and he spoke to her "It's about time to go" "come with me"  and mom always said the same thing every time "I know" "Alright" "I will okay"... My mom wasn't the super religious type like me but she still believed in Jesus Christ but after that happened I could tell she really believed and was heavy with guilt!!! Literally crying out to God for 3 days straight... If you do believe that's great but make sure your life reflects that and if you don't believe all I can tell you is might want to rethink what it is you do believe and just take my mom's LAST experience and my witnessing into consideration that's all... May Jesus Christ bless and watch over you all!!!🙏
The Cure does exist for 90% of all Cancers Via a modified version of HIV that the doctors in the Children's hospital in Philadelphia have come up with!!  This doctor needs funding big time!  He was on VICE Cancer Special 3 years ago!
The system is fucked up... Big pharma +Big government
One of the survivor this hit the spot
Thank you for putting this out.  I really think you sing better than you rap.  But I really like all your music.
This is John lennon level song writing.   Good lord tom.
I've just found out 2 of my good friends have stage 3 stomach Cancer this week..😶😶😶😶this song has me in tears.....  Tommy please never stop fighting for us!!!!!!!!
Thank you Tom.  Everyone going through the hurt and pain, continue to fight and keep your head up.
This song hit me really hard. I lost my grandma to lung cancer in August this year and I loved her a lot. I’m crying just typing this. I spent a lot of time with my grandma and the week she died she went from walking around the house and being able to do a good bit to not even being able to get out of bed with out help. I really like this song and you do so much good work Tom. Keep it up pale. Have a great day y’all. Bye
man i had to watch everything damn
seems like your using people in the wrong way to get clout, if your really cared youd also reach out not just preach out...a lot of people think your talking to them through your music so many peoples eyes are on you ...reach out bro, talk to your fans man...
Tomorrow’s two years since I lost my sister to stomach cancer.  Love your family.   God bless or good vibes to all.
I cried. I lost my mom to Leukemia when I was 17.
A notification just popped on my phone about this song while I was in the middle of telling a friend I'm going to someones funeral tomorrow because they died from cancer.
We all have cancer because of the way we grow our food! To much spraying of chemicals. Our fields are being over plowed so our soil is getting unhealthy so farmers have to spray. Tom talk about how farmers can save earth by putting carbon back in the earth instead of the sky start the draw down!! Save our planet and save humans
There needs to be more awareness like this about the scam of the modern healthcare indu$try.
I’m glad someone made this
My dog has cancer right now and I have two weeks of pain meds that’s it after that I have to do what I didn’t ever wanna do she’s been with me since I was 8 years old I have to say goodbye to her because of cancer I wish cancer never existed but it’s life I guess 😠 I hope my baby gets better but I know she won’t love you Cheyenne forever and I just wish we could go back in time 😭
Man you nailed it! That was way too real boss! 🤘
Cancer survivor for now. I pray it doesn’t come back but in the back of my mind I know it will. My poor dog has a mass but I’m learning so much from her that I will apply to myself if it does. I’m going to live the best I can and not fear the worst I’m going to be happy and look forward to each and every walk.  Thanks man.
Corny
We would have a curr if the government didn't kill the people who have found cures because they just want money.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart ❤
I don't know what to say brw Thnk you 🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿
Right on !  trillions have been poured into research and no better off than the 60s as I remember . No end in sight ! Research is a industry .   job security!
You did it again Tom! Thank you! Don't stop!
The chorus reminds me a little of the band angels and airwaves.   Great song
God has shown us he exist search odd tv flat earth before calling me names, if you want to know the truth and are sick of all the lies please check out his channel

My dad's been struggling with a rare cancer to the point where they are putting it in medical books to help educate doctors and I gotta say this has been such a big part of my 2020. Covid-19 at this point is a death sentance to him and so we take our precautions as everyone should. Love you pops my true hero! It pains me to see you struggle but I gotta say I'm so blessed for the time I have with you. We will beat this or we will give it a hell of a fight!
Your a fucking legend for bringing out this song bro never truer word sung big middle finger to the government for still fucking us as we struggle though tough times
Hey this song ain’t that bad but I made a Tom Macdonald Diss Track check it out
Holy fuck man, this is powerful...
I lost my dad to cancer one and a year ago. I miss him so much 😭😭😭
Finally a good song by this man that I can stand by 🙏🏾
That was a roller coaster from start to finish! I’ve lost several loved ones to cancer and it’s tough every time. Thank you Tom.
Damn tom   you make tha realist  song that  hit tha heart n mind  Thank u
Thank you so much for giving us this beautiful song.  Helping all of us going through hard moments of life.. cancer wont beat us..  we all love you.. God bless you..
Great video for a great cause!  I admire how you touch on things others will not or are scared to do.  This song touches everybody because cancer is one of the worst deaths that you can go through and everybody knows someone who has/had it.  Keep on keeping it real Tom.
Wow thats so powerful God Bless you man like not only do you shut up annoying haters but your a passionate loving and caring man like wow
This is a very emotional one for me and I'm sure for a lot of us 😢 Thanks for having a big heart Tom ❤🙏 #hangovergang
Thank you, Tom.
Thank you for this song! My mom a 2 time survivor of breast cancer...God is great...love this song!
Lost one of the best friends I've ever had (literally referred to each other as big and little brother) to brain cancer a few months ago. He was real young. When the girl looked in the mirror and I knew she was about to shave her head the tears started flowing.   Thanks for the song man.
Damn this is not only an amazing song but you speak the truth! Nice work, keep it up bro!
first :D
Powerful 💪
Fire, as always. Ty so much for what you do and how you lift ppl up that will never meet you.
Bro, as always...that got us all right in the feels.  The second time my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer, he said, “I beat this shit once, I can do it again.  I have cancer, cancer DOESNT have me!”.  Last month marked 3 years cancer free and I thank God every day that “my rock” is still around.  Powerful, meaningful song..you nailed it!  Thank you!!
I pray for those still fighting and for the families of those who have lost. this is an amazing song full of truth and hope, keep fighting and know you are not alone.....5 year survivor of two cancers, stage 4 papillary thyroid carcinoma and stage 1 Hurthel cell follicular thyroid carcinoma.
How it take 11 hours for youtube to tell me bout this?
I'm 28 years old and I cried like a three-year-old that pissed himself on the playground
Man keep preaching bro! My grandfather died of cancer when I was in my teens and he was still a young man. I also had an ex-gf that died from ovarian cancer, she didn't catch it early enough. My Aunt died from lung cancer in her 50s. They all fought as hard as they could but the treatments wore them down to where they couldn't fight any longer. And just recently cancer took EVH... I've been saying it since my grandfather, why can't they find a cure, we throw all this money at research and nothing?! We've solved or found cure for some of the deadliest diseases in the world but we can't find anything for cancer with 1000x the funding? Tom you got me in the feels bro! Keep exposing this shit!!!
HOW CAN ANYONE HATE THIS...????!!!!!! IM SICK AND ITS NOT CANCER BUT IT MAKES ME HAPPY..... THANK YOU TOM... ONE LOVE TO YOU.....
I cryed
Being a cancer survivor myself I love this song never gave up I became a fighter for my life #CancerSUCKS #NeverGiveUP
What an powerful song, Tom.  Everytime you sing, you combine compassion and truth and it is truly amazing.  I lost my grandfather to pancreatic cancer 2 years ago, by the time we knew what it was, it was to late.  What a beautiful song.  Thank you for sharing.  God bless
Lost my dad to pancreatic cancer in 2005. I was 20 years old, just becoming a man, and just getting to know my dad as a man. Two months after we found out, he was gone... my life and the lives of my family were changed forever. I'll never get over it. I love you dad!
I hate cancer last month I lost my grandmother to it she fought as long as she could thanks for this song 🖤
My grandpa died from cancer :((
Tom thank you for this! I have had a few people in my life who have been taken by cancer and that has now been brought to myself! This is the most evil disease and it has no heart no forgiveness! This has brought tears to my eyes! Thank you much love and respect!
Why are you never trending. It's really bugging me now. Lol
Tom when you make a video for YouTube comments shout Dee1WhoKills Out!! SUPPORTER HERE!
My dad was just told he has 2 types of cancer man you just help make it easier to deal with bro I appreciate it
I really like you dude. You're one of the only rappers who really keeps it real.
Excellent job Tom.  You have so much ability to touch people in so many ways. Stay faithful you are a legend we all need
Wow very good
R.I.P Momma I miss you . 🙏💞
Strait truth ryt thea ur amazing man
One of my friends was talking about you Tom Mcdonald on Facebook maybe a month ago. And I haven't stopped since. You are easily my favorite artist today. And your message is soo powerful. Keep it up! Doing the Lords work.
This is a work that will bring encouragement and healing to those who have experienced cancer.  It will touch so many hearts and lives.  My father, two brothers, aunt, and nephew died from cancer.    The thing that makes me angry is that they have the cure, but the heartless, bloodsuckers value money over the lives of those we love.  Keep preaching prophet... keep preaching!  Will definitely skyrocket to #1
Literally 99% won’t see this but bless you and stay safe I’m struggling to hit 200 with noti 🔔
U fucking killing it bro keep it up u talk facts
Wow such a powerful song. I got a pre-op in December for my kidney, I fought the past 4 years to get my a1c under control and didn't have to be insulin dependent and then I got hit with this with my kidney but I'll keep fighting.
This song hits home, god bless
I CALLED IT #6 ON TRENDING
You Tom MacDonald are a inspiration an have an amazing talent that touches more than you will EVER know thank you 🙏
This is pure POWER! Damn! You the man Tom 👊🏻Respect👊🏻
So much emotion. Lost a couple fam to cancer and I know as well they have to know  how to defeat it but they just want the money at our expense. BLESS THIS SONG MAKE IT #1 !!!! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 👏 😍
This hits home.
You always wake up a lot of people,nowdays am not listen song with content of women, drugs, porns, self proud etc, lost my time there

BRO TOM be spitting nothing but truth and facts he needs to be number 1
Can we talk about the doctors eyebrows 🤣🤣
This gonna be a great song around the world.thanks bro🙏💯
Thank you Tom.
Tom you are a G. You can come out HARD and you come out with compassion and sympathy. This song hit me as I watched my grandmother go from this time ago. I respect you 100% keep that up. Love your music and your movement
This song hits home and a hard punch to my gut because I'm watching my wife battle this terrible disease , watching her hurt and cry with the pain. I feel less than nothing because I can't take the pain and this disease away.
Fight it...and pray it..    There's something after this
Immunotherapy is an alternative to radiation but it’s CURRENTLY very expensive. It’ll come down in price but it’ll still be expensive for quite some time
This is so beautiful ❤️😭❤️😔❤️❤️❤️
#6 already on trending. Great song another one in the books. Great job man!
Tom. I don’t know what to say other than. You are an amazing person.
Powerful song.. much respect for putting out the truth✊🏼
Amazing how well he expresses himself without swearing every other line.
Loved it man another completely great song all around so many people needa heat this thanx for all the good quality music tom
Powerful and heart warming. Is there anything you can’t do. Keeping moving people  with your mind, lyrics and heart.
Thank you Tom 🙏
Thank you Tom this is absolutely amazing and very epic. It had me in tears from knowing how it feels having a close one with it F*CK CANCER.
How do you even dislike videos like this kinda sad actually
You got to my feels bro!!! What a work of art!!
[Verse 1] Everybody knows someone who's sick Forty percent will get cancer, only half's gonna live Your mom and your dad and your sister stand inside a room And someone won't survive it, do you hope it isn't you? I swear that cancer has a cure, but they're refusing to make it They've done like forty years of research, ninety billion in donations We've been running for the cure and wearing ribbons for ages Why are people still going through radiation? It's fucking crazy Hundred billion-dollar industry, they can't afford to end it And nobody wants to die, our only option is to spend it We give anything to stick around for just another second Give a fortune to the doctors who promise they can extend it The profits are astronomic, the hospital and the clinics Of fillings coffins with dollars, it's awful, let's just admit it We're all human, we'll keep fighting 'cause it's how we survive But it's scary 'cause we don't know where we'll go when we die  [Chorus] Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart  [Verse 2] Nothing matters if you don't have your health All the money in the world doesn't help The good might go to Heaven and the bad might go to Hell But no one wants to leave here, you can tell And cancer touches everyone, it's in our genetics And our world's become so toxic, it's all carcinogenic We've polluted the water, the air; the food we're ingesting Is full of hormones and poison, our population's infected They sell us cigarettes and liquor, built a business on addictions We've been paying them to kill ourselves, we're dying to keep living It's the system, it's a prison, we keep trying to beat it We get cancer from keeping all of our demons a secret And our insurance don't cover the things we need to defeat it And even if it does, then we might die from the treatment Our best defence is living like we do not know what cancer is Fight it if you have it and pray that there's something after this  [Chorus] Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart  [Bridge] You won't know how to be brave Till you choose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength Till you struggle to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith Till you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take Till you realize you didn't break  [Chorus] Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them all your fire The days are hard, the nights are long But you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart  One of the most meaningful lyrics I have ever heard. Don't give up y'all, we're *survivors* ❤️😌
The sad irony is that my dad had surgery last week to have 2 tumors removed. Luckily, the surgery went well and he's in the process of recovering. He has a giant hole in his back, but he's alive.
Amazing
Thank you xoxo
Awsome bro I  appreciate you
Fight the good fight! Dont give up!
Lost my dad to cancer .. My first tattoo is a tribute to my dad love the song

🔥🔥🔥
Tom i can't tell you how much your music has affected my life. I'm constantly turning new people and family to your music. And everyone loooves it. Keep doing you, please, don't ever change. This song hits the feels hard. Our family lost my grandfather to pancreatic and I sent this to all of them today. Thank you ✌
Then be real and support the administration that has taken a fight to big pharma, and I shouldn't have to explain that this isn't the Biden ticket. It's the administration that has formed executive orders around lowering the cost of insulin and other drugs through allowing the importation of them from other countries such as Canada, cutting prices to match that in other countries as well as the expedited FDA approval of generics. As of January 1st, transparency in pricing will be required in hospitals. These are orders that aren't immediate because these companies can fight this in court, but it's clear that these pharmaceutical companies investing in campaign ads against this administration should speak for itself in who you should be aligned with. They aren't on our side.
Wow, I lost my dad actually 9 years ago. Thank you right on.
Dude... I am speechless. That was so powerful. Keep lifting people up Tom, because someoneout there needs this song. Thank you for sharing it!!!!

My grandfather and father-in-law died of cancer so this hits home really hard. That being said this is a VERY powerful and strong song. Much love and keep up the amazing music brother!

The realest shit Tom macdonald ever wrote
"Only one person who likes this will be a billionaire" "Good Luck"🍀
Thank you for this. I lost my mom 7yrs ago to cancer and she didn't let it beat her or keep her down. She's still a strong and powerful influence in my life even today. Thank you. Strong message
The person that was actually first never commented
Hits different just shaved my hair off after growing it out for 4 years to donate to wigs for kids. Man screw cancer this shit needs to be put to an end.
Another powerful and amazing song Tom. Great job!
Good job Tom, we all needed this
My son passed away in January due to Neuroblastoma. I had to check out of this song after only a few lines. It's kind of insulting to the great men and women fighting for these patients and their families to suggest that they look upon these people's faces and withhold a cure that could save so much torment.
Tom is genius and don’t scare to speak the truth! You have saved many life. Thanks for the music 👏
The dislikes won't stop the love in this song. ❤❤❤
Lost my mum to cancer ... this song so true ty for your love tom it means the world to us that have seen cancer do it's worst.
I can say that WE have supported & donated  when it’s come to St Jude & the fight against childhood cancer, I wish we were financially able to support more organizations & children then we do but can only do what’s within our means.          A PRAYER TO STOP SUFFERING OR DAVE AN INNOCENT CHILD FROM HAVING TO FACE THAT CRYEL THING GHAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT ON BY OUR Government, Society, the rules & regulations of these factories that produce the majority of mean that “most” of us consume ..............    WHY ARE THISE WHO RAISE, manage, take care of (which includes the amount of HORMONES they are pumping into these animals ALLOWED ???  Why ???     To solve a problem or issue ONE must start from the beginning moment it’s presented then work ones way up (LIKE A MATH PROBLEM, only the ones agreeing condoning & allowing certain standards to be ignored only to be handed down to the next is NOT Ca.........     UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS THE WORLD WE LIVE IN, and for the MAJORITY of us we can only manage them Afford what theses company, farm & Plant owners GIVE US.
Wow...!! Honestly I'm speechless... I haven't heard a song that brought tears to my eyes in a long time Tom.. No fake shit.. no fake talk.. I feel this is THE best song of the year period and one of your best EVER..!! Just wow man.. 10 out of 10..!! Sharing on all my platforms..!!
Medicare For All.
Wow this is absolutely....horrible.....like the rest of his songs
If you got cancer quit eating cancer causing foods
This gave me chill lost to manny i have fuck cancer on my wall in my room
Just lost my father in law today to Cancer.....God broke the mold after him, an amazing man that treated everyone he just met like his best friend...that old dude strength that always carried a pocket knife...Love ya Larry...thanks Tom!
As always great video and a message I needed specifically today!
God bless you for this. I’m one of the lucky few to beat this family curse. Hold strong, stand firm and march on!!!!
The song touches my heart
I just had a family member die from cancer on tuesday. RIP Kathy. You were taken way to soon.
Lost my mom 7 months ago.  She beat cancer but the treatment destroyed her intestines.  Everyday is a struggle without her.  She was only 62.

Still speechless.... lost so many family members from cancer. Love your music bro your doing amazing. Keep it up!!
If you disliked this, you are lost and hopeless
He came, he gave his life for ours. His name is the only name under Heaven which man can be saved. We do know where we're going, and his name is Jesus Christ.
More truth from Tom.  In 2013 my Dad lost his fight with cancer that he had fought for years. I remember one time we were at the hospital and he was wearing his favorite "Fuck Cancer" shirt. This lady was in the waiting area with us and looked at him and told him, "You know that shirt is really offensive"" My dad just looked at her and said "Do you have cancer?" and when she said no he told her she didn't understand and walked away. Thank you for this song. #hangovergang  Edit: My DAD, my hero  https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/486638_4657690883581_449906435_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&_nc_sid=09cbfe&_nc_ohc=QJfgbUaHXyIAX9fHvTl&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.xx&oh=db367b7cd6d76100284c0a7462e47162&oe=5FB1E260
Because of the increasing rate that prophecy is being fulfilled, this world is quickly coming to a close. The great tribulation is about to begin, the worst time this world will ever know. God the Father wants to have a relationship with His creation. But everyone is born into sin and we need a way for us to be able to live eternally with the Father in heaven. Jesus made that way. Even though He is God, He left heaven and came to earth to be a sacrifice for a lost world. He never sinned. He was abandoned by His friends, was betrayed by Judas and handed over to be crucified. He was beaten so badly that He could not be recognized as a man. Then He willingly suffered an agonizing drawn out death on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised Him from the dead. And now He sits at the right hand of the Father and He is coming back any day now to Take home those who belong to Him. Just believe that He died for your sins.  You don't have to repent of sins. People who teach that, are wrong and they are not saved.  You don't have to give up drinking or drugs, etc. Just have faith that Jesus fully paid the price. After you are saved rest in Jesus' sacrifice. God will guide you and help you get rid of bad habits and to do good works according to His will. If you think you should do works, you're saying Jesus' sacrifice was not enough. Faith plus works will NOT save you. Once you believe that Jesus died for your sins, you will receive the Holy Spirit and you are sealed for eternity. Nothing you do or don't do can cause you to lose your salvation. Those who say that you can lose it are not saved. There is nothing we can do! It's all about what Jesus did! God gave us free will but He is a just God.  Rejecting salvation means an agonizing eternity in hell! In the great tribulation, the age of grace will be over and to be saved you must believe on Jesus plus resist taking the mark of the beast. Believe on Jesus now and you will escape having to go through the great tribulation!         I will try to answer if you have any questions.        For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16
Your music speaks to me, man.
Your such a inspiration Tom ☺️ and this was so beautiful 🥰...
This is amazing 👍
Thank you Tom. Im sure you know the change you have and will make just thank you for being you. This and the sober song should be on everyone's play list its an inspiration no matter what genre of music you like. Thank you again Tom Mcdonald and may your days be blessed 🙌
❤️💔♥️
Thank you Tom, your are awsome.
The most important thing i can say is never let the money change you for the worse.....
one of ur best songs bro
😢😢
RIP to my Grandma, several family members, my childhood friends, the dogs and cats I've loved and.....to the best friend I've ever known.
I love it.My brother had cancer and died after surgery.My Mom had cancer.
Yes, truly sad our world is run by psychopaths and sociopaths who don't give a shit about anything other power and control. All the cures to "incurable" diseases are kept back. We The People have to find everything out for ourselves and blow it up until mass numbers of people make waves and then they play dumb and along and finally "find a cure" because they cant hide it anymore.
Share this
Loved it Tom and Nova!!!
Dam bro. Keep doing you. Always with a message love it. Much love
Soursop, Chaga mushroom, Turkey tail mushroom, Jim Kelmun protocol, Johanna budwig protocol. All of these things fight cancer strongly. Nature always had the answers.
Bro u suck for this one! Great song. But I cant watch the whole thing. My Dad has pancreatic cancer and he just stopped the treatment. The radiation was killing him faster then the cancer was. It made him far worse. My Dad is like my fucking Superman. I dont want to lose him. Thank you for the song tho. Rock ur music daily bro. Stay up.
There's so many people that lose the will to keep fighting hopefully a lot of the ones will hear this and bring back there fire 🔥🔥
Thank you Tom 🙌.  Right now my mom my grandma my husband mom have cancer. This was the best for us!!
My son was diagnosed with Burkitts Lymphoma at age 4. He's 10 now. I gave birth to my hero 💙
Hard. As fuck. This shit right here...hard.
"And cancer touches everyone, it's in our genetics And our world's become so toxic, it's all carcinogenic We've polluted the water, the air; the food we're ingesting Is full of hormones and poison, our population's infected They sell us cigarettes and liquor, built a business on addictions We've been paying them to kill ourselves, we're dying to keep living It's the system, it's a prison, we keep trying to beat it We get cancer from keeping all of our demons a secret"  Some of the realist lyrics.
You never cease to amaze me with the depth of which you bring truth and conviction into your lyrics for EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING!! Love ya man and thank you! I always say that "sadly in the medical industry A Patient Cured is a Profit Lost" and all we are are a profit to them....
There actually is a cure for cancer. There was a doctor in Mexico who got arrested for his practices because he didn't have a license. But every person with cancer that went to him survived it.
Just an amazing song, as always!
Man you really just gotta respect the hell out of this man every song is straight to the point an honest as hell thank God we got an artist thats not willing to be silenced just  to have a record deal 🙏 💯
Excellent job on this one. Keep up the good work.
I lost my mom to cancer on my birthday 🥺😭
If I could heart this I would
if you disliked this you dont understand theres a problem with what's going on with cancer. hes pointing it out
This fucking off the chain bro ..242 in the building
Weak!!
Hey Tom, I'm 32 like you. I grew up listening to Em (not in my parents' house, that was the devil's music you know) loving how raw he was, how he told a story while flowing like a river and making you say 🤯. Don't mistake me for a hater, I'm not beating on Em because I still can identify with his older stuff. But he's changed his delivery, his flow seems faster and I'VE changed as my tastes in music have evolved over time. I don't listen to Em now for a few reasons but mostly I miss the REALNESS of the everyday struggle painted for my ears in those old jams. You got that REALNESS Tom, and that's why I love your music and what you represent. Keep it up, homie. Much love.
Bless you for this. I survived last year radiation and all it was tough and my sister is fighting for her life right now... I almost couldn’t get through the video but you are right everything you said is true. If there is a G-d then you are blessed for this song the truth you speak and the hope it gives. Thank you Tom💔💪🏻
Fucking love this song!!
The real cancer is Tom's music.
This one Tom is the greatest statement you have made yet. Not only is the video heart touching, but the lyrics are absolutely incredible!
My dad did of cancer rip dad !
love it Tom!!!! Both my parents got cancer about 2 years ago and today both are cancer free. They was doing treatments together it was hard to see. I took them 3 days every week for 12 weeks. I was at their house more than mine. My wife helped out so much and our daughter and my parents have always been close. It was very hard on her to see them going though it and hard for me because this was something I could not fix for my daughter.
i dont know about yall but i do believe there is a cure for any disease/infection in this world(except for those just came up) health care, pharmaceuticals are just a big elite business now. even govt benefits from it. ANY govt.
“You won’t know how to be brave till you choose to fight when you’re afraid. And you can’t experience strength till you struggle to carry the weight. And you won’t know why you have faith till you look the devil in his face. And you don’t know what you can take till you realize you didn’t break.”  I’m speechless. How do you find the perfect words every time? This is a good one 💜
Yea my sister is just eight..and well there was pill that could’ve helped her- so she wouldn’t have to go through chemo. But the doctors had a computer choose what she got....I’m just really upset. Her hair is thinning out.. if she gets sick it could cause her to be in the hospital for a while or ya know. If she’s stuck in the hospital my parents won’t work.. we don’t have much as it is... it’s just really tough.
😪😪😪 this.....thanks.....true
Cringing with Cancer McDonald’s
I lost my dad Christmas morning 2016, and it sucks. But when you know they had that spiritual change in their heart, and you see that peace  they didn't have before, it's a pain you can deal with. It's hard seeing your loved ones go thru everything that it brings. But it's a relief knowing they aren't in pain, miserable, and suffering anymore. I pray everyone finds our Creator and He makes the situation as easy as possible. Anyone fighting cancer now, I love you,  but most important God loves you. Seek Him and let Him change your life.
Bro much respect for this!!! I lost my grandfather to pancreatic cancer 12 days after my 12th birthday. He lived for 3 almost 4 yrs with it after they told him he would only live for 6 months!!! He was a fighter a stubborn old school kind of man who was the whole world to me growing up! I miss him everyday and this song hit me hard!!!
Dude Tom my boy. Ya went deep with lyric on this 1 . 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 heart and passion comes out of this 🎙.  Everyone be sure to 📲 this hit #Tom4Live
I have loved every song and music video I've heard. Thank you
My supervisor at my job just went to heaven last Thursday due to cancer, I've been there almost 7 years RIP Red
Your songs are amazing I wish I had an artist like you around when I was younger. I'm only a mortal man but I can say without any doubt in my words that God if you call them that appreciates your music, because you lift people up with the words you sing and that fact you are the most honest singer, rapper or simply a person there is. It's not only your heart you sing from but your soul.
Within 3 seconds you gave me chills. Love the topics you choose to rap about. This hit home for real.
After death is love.
Well done Tom, well done 💯🙏💪👍✌
You're the only one that has the balls enough to speak the truth about the game of cancer treatment
I lost my mom to cancer. The chemo beat her down until there was no more fight left in her. My mother was fighting cancer, MS, and so much more and chemotherapy was the straw that broke the camel's back. My mother was a strong woman and a fighter and what makes it worse is that the doctors overlooked the cancer for a year or two. Plus her medicade wouldn't cover the chemo but the doctor gave it to her anyways. Now that I know that these doctors get roughly $4K per vial of chemo given it pisses me off so much. I just know that if I ever see that doctor out in public I'll probably go to jail for beating him to death. Thank you for making this song,  and trying to tell the truth about the entire cancer industry,  and trying to expose it for the revenue generating BS system that it is.
I watch and listen to all your music tom and hardly ever comment. But thanks for this. Just lost my mom after a 10 year off and on battle with cancer.
🔥 as always Tom keep up the fantastic work man
Love your music
At this time 500 people have disliked this video. Can just one of you please explain what there is to dislike. If this song reaches one person who has cancer and helps them thru the pain and fear how can a human dislike this. Tom you have sent a powerful message to anyone going thru this fight. To all of those enduring this battle I pray you whip it's ass. To those who dislike I hope and pray you don't have face this battle but if you do do yourself a favor and play this video because it's for you to. Much love and respect. HOG4LIFE
My mom has just died from stage 4 lung cancer. She was only in her 50s. I took care of her the whole time and i was laying the bed holding her when she passed. I did it all while with a new born. This song is everything ive screamed over and over. Its just 2 true. Its almost to difficult to listen to.  Also she loved your music. I would play it to her on the way to treatments
Thank you Tom and nova. I took care of my mom when she was passing from cancer. I’m the one that found her the day she passed. I was only 25. She was a strong woman til her last day. I’m 44 now and still miss her everyday. To those out there fighting...look the grim reaper in the face and smile 🙏🏻
Cancer sucks but so do harmful conspiracies. Just taking the time to look could show you the thousands of different ways we've been able to treat cancers, none of which would be possible without research, funding, and medical study
My mom  got cancer years ago and die .... that song got me good
Thank you for shining a light on the truths in this world ✌🏻
No man is good, no not one.  The people who go to heaven don’t deserve it, however it is the sacrificial death that Christ died and subsequent conquering of death that can save.  It is by God’s grace, thru faith in Christ and his salvation.  So only it is not by mans doing one can be saved, yet only by the doing of Christ.  I guess I thought it was obvious why we needed to be saved however to many it is not!  Many people will go through life thinking they are the good people because they measure themselves by standards such as super bad immoral people.  Yet you have to measure your goodness by the perfection of Christ.  He even said if you looked at a woman with lust you have committed adultry in your heart.  Or if you have thought evil of someone you have committed murder.  I think it should be made clear we have all sinned.  And thus we all deserve hell.  I deserve the infinite pouring out of God’s wrath because of my imperfection, my unrighteous deeds, my sin.  Yet it is Christ who saves unworthy men.
This goes through your heart just the song is so meaningfull
This goes through your heart just the song is so meaningfull
Iam a single mom of 3 fighting everyday ❤ thanks tom
do these people ever listen to non youtube rappers that sound like a teen tv show theme song
Both my uncles died from different cancer... watching this brought back the old tears from years past. They both taught me things that made me who i am today. The modern day plague.  😔  Except this time its not rats. We now live in a world where sick is profit...🥺😠
Made me Cry 😥 but much NEEDED 🙏
Another banger from the man himself Mr. Tom Macdonald keep it up man! Hangover gang for life!
Ty tom we need more music like this
💛
I listen to you everyday you go hard on every song you make but this is hard hit me so hard i currently have stage 2 colon cancer and do chemotherapy this disease has taken so much from me but my illness  doesn't define me. Your lyric your a fighter when its dire made me cry goin everyday through this struggle this is why your one of my favorite artists.
😭
Tom, PLEASE, your voice get heard..... do a song ABOUT the mass murder of the farmers in SOUTH AFRICA! It is dire. A 21 year old kid got hung on a pol after being tortured  for his dad to find him in the field.....just because he was a farmer.
As usual you bring light and truth to a disturbing subject and we can always tell where your heart is...
Seems fitting my post is above Marfs, we would love to interview you Tom and your epic Truth Speak musik. Please hit up Adam aka Marf, or tune into our Truth Speak news show weekly . Thank you Tom you nailed this one. My besty is a survivor and I’m blessed to have her in my life. #ReleaseTheCure
Naaah
You have no idea how many people you just inspired and built back up gave hope! WHAT OTHER ARTIST GIVES HOPE! Omg Tom Your amazing !!!! ❤️
Loving this shit man my aunt is going through cancer right now I showed her this I havent seen her this happy in while God bless you
i littralyd almost cried
This one has a lot of weight man. Great presentation on this problem we have. Prayers to all that are affective on this one. Love all of ya and wish you the best. Cancer...my aunt had it and she fought it off. She was lucky but my friend wasn't so lucky she was a fighter but still it took a hold and within that year she was gone. Still thinking about it.
This song is very emotional for me. Lost a loved one of cancer and now my dad is battling cancer and going through radiation treatments. Such a corrupt industry. If Magic Johnson can be cured of HIV then there must be a cure for cancer as well.
Lost my mom 4 months ago from stage 4.. these songs hit a little different these days.. youre an artist brother man, keep on shining ✨
I love your music. Is so real and your so right . Bless you
Lots of love and respect from New Zealand Tom my girl and I love your music man.
They can try to make a vaccine for coronavirus but they can't find one for cancer??? Something ain't right
Dude. This is the one ARTIST... that’s all the one artist ... this dude is an artist .. a beautiful artist with a beautiful message. Your music Is wonderful. People love You Tom
Thank you Tom
I fucking love this god dang song brother🤟🤟🤟
Currently my baby brother who’s 11 years old has stage 4 cancer. And is fighting it out. Strong and still as positive as ever through the hard times. He was diagnosed earlier this year and it’s been one crazy ride so far. I’ll be showing him this song.
Sending love and prayers to anyone and everyone who reads this who is fighting a battle or knows someone who is. My grandpa is currently going through chemo for stage 3 lung cancer and he so extremely healthy it was a major shock. It’s so hard.. 😞
Made me cry. Well written as usual the truth.
Thx for making this video bro my grandma passed away from kidney cancer when I was just 14 and I had a mental breakdown and had to be put in mental health and I was in there for 90 days cuz I never had a father in life and she was that person that fought for me to get me and my mother away from my abusive alcoholic dad and brought us to stay with when I was just 5 and when I was older I met my father in law and he was always around me his grandson Tanis everyday and he became my real dad duane and I loved him very much and in 2018 we found he had pancreatic cancer and didn't even have 4or 5 months left so me and my brother James his son decided that we would take over care for him and we did from September 18 to December 28 when we had to call hospice to care for him and he passed in January between my brothers birthday on the 3rd and my birthday on the 14th  holding my hand and my brother James hand on the 10th and his last words to us love u keep the family faith and love God
My mom,my uncle,2 of my cousins passed away of cancer..this song helps me think of when they were alive and happy and not how they were on their death beds..thank you 😊  forever my favorite rapper and singer..🇲🇵🇫🇲
Thank you for being so honest, fucking love you
I can relate to this because I lost my mom to breast cancer at the age of 7 and Im now 15. So, I’m saying to all the people out there that have cancer that my thoughts and love are with you. Please keep fighting the good fight.To those who are not fighting I hope you can come to peace with your situation and make the most out of life by doing all the possible good things and sharing   some love. Please don’t drown in sadness. Talk to someone if needs be or seek help and to those who know someone with cancer please support and share some love with them.
My grandpa was dealing with his 2nd bout of kidney cancer. He currently has to go thru dialysis and transfusions to survive. He's my Idol. I hope one day he understands that.
Cancer has taken so much from me and millions of others over the years! I love this one Tom. Thanks for always being 💯
#truth stay strong 💪🏼
This is beautiful 😍
The truth is scary. This almost got me choked up. No I don't have cancer but I lost a grandmother to it and I am recently diagnosed T1D who was critical and close to death. I decided to start my journey and suit up to fight this and so far I'm doing great. This November I will be 1 year sober as well from cigarettes and alcohol.  Don't stop believing and don't stop fighting. As soon as you stop those two things then your already dead. WILL is the key to long lasting life. As long as you have the will to live then nothing can touch you. God bless all of those that are sick. Remember it's not your fault. Tom knows what's up. I knew everything he was talking about. #H.O.G.fam Tom for president!
I wish I could like this video twice. Keep taking the road less followed Tom. You’ll soar even higher, first in hearts...then in minds...and finally, in ratings (which is the least important of these three)... Beautiful song.
oh god great message and song but you can literally see the movie makeup on her head bruh
You can hear the pain and empathy in this song. Losing my mom in '07, it's something I never wish anyone to have to suffer through.  Love you all, love you Tom.
Tom is is why I love you man not just you but your soul is pure and to be real you got the balls to speak on all the bullish/t true lies.
Your messages are always on Point!! Good job Tom and "Hang Over Gang", keep pushing!
Sad but true my stepdad has bone cancer I know exactly what you're talking about and I've been studying medical history terminology factuality since I was 16 and I'm 40 and you have a very damn valid point
This song is so true, and the rapping is GREAT!!  But can we take a minute to appreciate this beautiful beat?
Tom, you’ve outdone yourself!! This my friend is a very poignant piece you’ve created and it’s amazing. I’m crying and it’s perfect!!! Thank You!! 💯☮️❤️😊
All I can say for the dislikes you handle the true, why I love Tom he ain't scared to tell it
I lost my dad this year to cancer! This song is amazing and I hope it helps others going through this battle!
No one wants cancer, but it’s unrealistic at this point in time to “cure” cancer.
Heck yeah!
Respect brother, truly powerful. Love you tunes tom stay strong
Absolutely beautiful   cancer affects everyone either personally or someone we love ❤️ thank you for the very beautiful message you put into this song
As someone who has an older sister who has watched one of his older sisters struggle with cancer and found out that she won her battle against cancer through chemo this song really speaks to me.
I am so glad you wrote this Tom.  You truly are a badass and fuck big pharma.  They are the only reason I won’t have my type 1 diabetes cured.  What would they do if they lost the 400 a month I spend on supplies and medicine?
501 people thumb down this! What is wrong with you people! Wow! Tom - Nothing but respect!!
Wow that was beautiful
If you dislike this song......do you like cancer? 🤨
Goosebumps even a couple of mins after the song
Thank you Tom
I know cancer surface will die In  cellular form through exposure of venom
This song is so corny
Lol 😂
You know (my)a study on exposing venom of other species(spider)to humans  decomposing cancer surface areas has all doctors previously behind it killed .
I'm 28 and the first time I've ever bought a CD was gravestones and flowers for the dead didn't really think it through apparently a PlayStation 4 doesn't read CDs so I can only listen to them in my car I ended up having to go get an old school boombox just so I can jam with my friends I love every song on both CDs keep it up man I love you my kids love you and everyone I've told about you loves you can't wait for the next video
P O W E R F U L !!!
This old Macdonald doesn't have a farm. 😔
My uncle had a rare form of cancer, he beat it. He Pushed on, I love him to death. He taught me to hold strong and Push On #Survivor #Cancer #Push On #Win
https://youtu.be/RumSb9qU0Uk

Fucker. My wife walked jn and I was crying like a baby. Could barely spit out, Tom macdonald.
SOMEBODY PROTECT THIS MAN!!!!!!
Gotta get this to number 1!!!!!!! ASAP!!!  Song broke my heart, lost so many loved ones to cancer. I’ve seen the good days and long nights with bad days. People who haven’t had cancer or don’t understand what cancer is it’s horrible. I pray for all those who are fighting that we are in this together. Love you all stay strong   Thanks Tom this video means the world to me!!!

Thank you for this bro my friend died yesterday from cancer and we all wish he was back with us.
Please find the cure please. Thank you for this song. I lost my grandmother to cancer and it has messed up my grandfather 60 years of marriage 3 kids and 1 grandson me. I miss her so much but to look at my grandfather and see his pain drive's me mad. She never smoked but got throat cancer from work.
Wow! You never disappoint me. I'm always looking for what's next. This is beautiful. Thank you! Dedicated to my grandmother and sister-in-law, both in heaven. ❤️
Got me to tears man... putting words to what my family is dealing with now. Thank you for this... thank you
Hit me so hard I couldn't breathe. This is brilliant ❤️
Sent this to my mom,she cried then thanked me. Just wanted to pass along the message, thanks Tom.
Wow..this hits close to home way to close
This video is just beautiful you can just see that what he is singing is what he feels and it’s just beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ We all love you Tom ❤️
Tom thank you. I lost my mom back in 2015. And to be honest she was my only true friend. I choose to believe this is for her and every other individual who has had to battle this disgusting enemy. And anyone who stood by there side as a loyal soldier. Thank you tom
🔥Fucking Fire Man! Keep speaking the truth!
Made me drop a tear. 😥
Awesome song Tom really hit hard my ex’s brother passed 5 years ago this month from cancer
how the hell is there 499 dislikes on this video.....
Best song ever
Thank you Tom. I need to hear this. Cancer has personally affected my family. Hearing this showed me to never give up. Much love ❤️
Lost my grandma to cancer In 2007 I was young but shit this hits
Dam words can't touch what this song means to me I lost my hero my best friend my everything my dad a year ago from cancer and it has been a long road for me but I'll keep going but thank you for all of your music it has helped me through a lot of hard times you are an amazing person please never change much love hang over gang for life
There is a cure for cancer.. there are multiple cures.... If they make it available to EVERYONE, then the pharmaceutical industry dies.. THC, CBD and many other Natural remedies are suppressed over money....
I got no words.. AWESOME song..
My dad just died 3 weeks ago from lung and kidney cancer. Thankyou for this seriously
You kill it Tom I have a sister that survive cancer and I was the donor of bone marrow and thanks to God she survive, thanks for that it reminds me every single moment I went through God bless you and keep reaching the hearst of people 🔥🔥💪🏽🤙🏽.
The video quality is amazing. And the message is facts. Big pharma is corrupt as fuck.
20 seconds in, I was crying. Rest In Peace, Grandmother Jessie, Grandmother Allison, Aunt Faye, Cousin Tanner & so many more!! ❤💔🙏
Good job on this
Thank you Tom and Nova!
Watched 4 people is my fam die of this shit . I was one of the lucky ones . Stay strong
I found my mother inlaw dead in her trailer home hallway... She died alone and she was bald very much not her, she looked like someone else.. it was pretty disturbing..ive seen cancer destroy a few people.. That was by far the rawest and realest.
I've lost too many people due to cancer, I myself am a survivor of cancer
Listen, I don’t politically really agree with Tom Macdonald, and I think he can be a little dumb, but this song hits so deep, so thanks for this man.
That was deep.. Thanks for that bro.
Just watched clouds. Then stumbled on this song. God bless u Tom and Nova. Much love.
I love the way u think Tom.   Much appreciated man ..
I lost my husband  6/25/2012 . Stage 4 squamous cell of the maxillary sinus. This song made me cry the ugly cry. Thank you so much for putting the truth in your songs. The shit we went through with chemo, radiation, and then they ask if you want to be part of a study.  Fuck Cancer, and fuck the industry that panders to them, when they know there are cures out there but big pharma is more worried about making that money. In the meantime  our loved ones suffer, and some unfortunately pass away.
I won't like this song because of the 1st 45 seconds of conspiracy rhetoric thinking that money is the reason cancer still exists. Everyone knows multiple people effected by cancer, and no matter how much money and power can corrupt, I refuse to believe that it can corrupt so deeply that people 'hiding the secret' could sit idly by and not speak up.
💔💔💔
Just wow!wow!!!!
Dude your awesome
My heart is crying😭 this is a song close to my heart❤ TY and luv y'all💓 great work guys #TheTruthByTomMacDonaldLyricalGenuis
I feel this with having cancer.
Damn you for making me tear up.  Damn you
This song is everything. this song leaves me speechless. My dad has been battling throat cancer, was in remission and in the past months it has came back. He is a fighter. I will be sending him this song. Thank you so much for your music and your truth. It means so much to so many. Keep going, keep changing lives. ✌🏼🙌🏼
Tom gets better with every song!
Thank you for this. F*ck cancer!
I refused radiation n kemo treatment
I would give up my life for a kid to be Cancer free...Take me up on that Lord
Mannnnn if y’all could see the goose bumps I have
Tom check this out. I met a doctor who had the cure for cancer. She came into my shop it was about 3 1/2 years ago. She had her face wrapped up because she was scared for her life. It was her and 6 other doctors who made the cure. She injected herself with stage 4 cancer to test it out. It took 4 weeks and 4 shots of the antidote.  After the 4th week she was cancer free. She was also in the newspaper as well and she showed us everything. It was crazy because just 2 months before she came by my grandpa died from cancer. The doctor told us that 3 of her other doctors have so called ‘commit suicide’ after they went viral. She told us she lives in fear and if anybody comes around asking for her she told us not to tell them and act dumb. Well we get her car taken care of and she leaves well about 10 minutes pass by and here’s a guy dressed up like the fbi. He starts asking about her and all of us act stupid like we never seen this lady before. Well he leaves. The truth is the government and the elites will not let that happen. So they kill off people with the cure so that way they can have population control.   Y’all please like and get this comment to the top so we can spread awareness on why cancer will never have a cure.
This is has no soul good lyrics but no feeling
This is why I love Tom. This made me cry and touched me so deeply. A true artist who isn't afraid to speak truth and isn't in this just for the clicks. Love you Tom
You are truly unbelievably talented! I love your story and will always be a fan. My aunt was diagnosed yesterday! Literally!  I'm just overwhelmed with emotions...Keep being you!
Thank you man I have been in a dark spot my uncle just got diagnosed with terminal cancer in his stomach and we can’t even visit him in the hospital
Dude this song pulled my heartstrings... keep up the great work Tom and Nova keep doing you!
this is amazing just like your other songs . keep spreading the truth beacuse is the most important thing ! and also i probably quit smoking  just to stop paying to kill my self !
Another amazing track by Tom! Thank you Tom and Nova
Best Song you've Ever made Tom😎🕊
Amazing message, keep speaking the truth!
From 8 to 6 in a little over an hour...lets keep goin
My cousin beat cancer!!
DO NOT STOP!!!! Speak it, sing it, open their minds bro. THANK YOU!!!
Why does this have dislikes? It honestly shocks me
this is the first video I've seen in a long time with REAL emotion and HEART speaking the TRUTH  cancer has cures mostly in the integrative medicine world but the best cure is prevention through avoidance of toxic substances which is NOT easy but it is possible and it is possible to remove the toxins already accumulated. turn to nature eat organic!
😪💔 thank you Tom ♥️ so much I just lost my mother in law oct 9th to multiple myeloma n alot of family to cancer its been so hard now I have to get a biopsy thinking I have ovarian cancer i been a mess
Fuck yea!! Thanks for this!
Man this hit me hard..i lost my dad to cancer at 16! Thank you for this song Tom!
The song and the comment section can anybody cry...
This is one of the few times "rap" and "real" can be used in the same sentence. Thank you tom.
I lost my grandma to a second round of breast cancer on July 6th..thank you for this
Please tell me you demonetized this, better yet if you didn’t, please tell me you’ll donate even though it hasn’t seemed to change it, it’ll save someone.
Tom, from so not just experience just cancer but also help alchohol addiction and mental health.. Also, legal from the DUI. I WOULD LOVE TO DO A VIDEO WITH YOU AND IM LOOSING MY RIGHT FOOT over my injury due to the injury but fucking maryland wouldn't allow me to stay in New Jersey as they can promise treatment. Maryland cant honor the additional help I can get out out of state because of my medical problems. I Have sent you a message on FB, I would appreciate a song and will share my story
I always love ur music bro n always will
I actually have cancer. Stage 3 thyroid cancer
I love you for this. This is actually helping me.
Bro, this song is so powerful! So much truth and sadness 🙏
Thanks for that song bro!!! It took me back through some memories and I haven't thought back on those times in awhile. A lot of great, happy, sad, painful yet, soothing memories, it all hit at once and I cried harder than any song has ever made me cry in my life and I'm 35 years old. I felt something I haven't felt in more than 10 years, something I thought that I would never feel again....that feeling is HOPE!! Hope that I can turn my life around like you did for my children. Again, thank you from the bottom of my heart brother!!! Keep cranking out that amazing music!!
🙏🏽
nothing but truth lost my dad to cancer wish they would treat cancer like covid and come out with a cure in just 1 year
Wow what a Beautiful ,powerful song good job Tom 😃🙏🏻
Dammit I'm crying.
I dont think this guy will ever cease to amaze me. One of the only guys to talk about what actually matters
Your the best Tom ur truly a blessing hangover gang
I love this kind of music from him. So uplifting.
Rest in peace katie barstis 09 22 1989 to 6 28 2020 fought a 3 year battle cervical spread to liver and abdomen....she leaves behind 5 children ...family first .....
That's why I'm investing in Elon Musk's neural uplink technology, my body may be dead in the future but my mind will be quite alive. I'm planning on being a simulacrum when my body parishes. A ghost in a shell.
Wow! I’m so humbled by this song and you truly are amazing. So honored to be in the HOG fam!
As a cancer survivor, this song will help a lot of people. Staying positive and knowing you are stronger than you think helps, too. 💕
Blessings bruh
Dear Tom, If I read your comments, this is a message from a fan  I would love to see you come to know the Lord, because I would love to meet and shake your hand when we don't have to worry about the issues of the world Peace God bless           Sincerely yours, Trey M. Milton
No one wants to leave... but unlike the masses, I'm ready! It's not for me to choose when nor where. I serve the Lord and he protects and He calls his home when the time has come. No fear. Doing God's work day in and day out. Persecute me for my righteousness and I'll still be here even though you are gone.  Cause I am a fighter and I know good from wrong. I will do whats right no matter if people say I'm wrong.  Thanks for this Tom! people need to get back to being focused on what really is the problem... I'll give the people a hint (it aint the Rona). God Bless HOG!
My grandfather died of cancer, my sweet neighbor friend, and so did my father in law. It’s insidious.  Thank you for this. ❤️🙏🏼
Omg as a cancer survivor this song hits hard love it.
Damnit got hit with a double shot today your video about cancer I lost both my parents to cancer and than on Jellyrolls new cd his song STILL MY HERO helped me grieve for my dad a little bit something I have yet to really do since he passed away. Thank you Tom for a great song and 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕CANCER
My aunt died of Brest cancer and my grand dad died of brain cancer. Which I am predisposed to. 41 and mind is slipping more everyday.
I had a roommate that was diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer.  She's still fighting it, although she has also accepted what the final outcome will be.  I'll be sharing this song and video with her when I see her again.   To me, this song is basically telling us we need to live each day as if it is our last,  cause you never know what's around the corner.   Stay strong,  keep fighting and never give up.  H.O.G. for life
Thank you Tom. Today they began a morphine drip for my Uncle in Hospice. He is so tiny now and weak. He has been fighting a very tough battle. This song is so beautiful ty again......
My heart goes to anyone who does or is dealing with someone who has cancer. My aunt Doreen has suffered from breast cancer had her breasts completely removed beat it and now she has had cancer multiple times after she still does. she has had to deal with four different cancer diagnosis and she's still alive and kicking God bless tom MacDonald for making relevant music thanks boss hog
this will certainly get buried, but its all i can say. Tom, you are making difference, we know what you do is not easy and giving up must be tempting at times. but you bless millions of us with your music. keep being strong for us. God bless you my dude. keep on keeping on. youve touched more souls than you could ever know. On behalf of all of us... Thank You.
I have lost 4 aunts/uncles and all of my grandparents to cancer. Thank you for this.
Wow, Tom, this is deep! This is nothing but the truth ❤️ I am getting ready to go through quadruple bypass surgery and I am scared! I am trying to fight through the fear so I can get it done and live on.....
Hell yeah!
Lost my dad 16 year ago   he was 56..too soon..touched my heart with this one..thank you..love it keep going on the issues..
Awesome song Tom, love it
Hey Tom, Just want to say I love your raps, and the message you bring with them that targets the problems in our world. And I really feel like other artists need to start taking to how you do things. I do have a small request...I havent seen a single song about love, personally I would like to hear what you have to say about love - or the lack of love. Please dont ever stop being you, the world needs to hear you.
Tom you are #1 on top for me who ever don't like you don't like the truth keep em coming
Not gonna lie i got hella teary eyed on this one tom because i lost my dad to cancer back in 08 and unfortunately i think im getting ready to go have some major health issues myself that might lead to cancer or diabetes....praying that it dont tho
Wow I really didnt expect this from Tom dame I been sleepin on this dude
This means a lot man. My baby cousin was diagnosed with cancer when she was 2 and thank the lord she beat it. I’ve lost way too much from cancer and we need to figure something out.
I watched my father in law fight for a year and a half the second time he fought it. When he lost his battle my wife and I sat with him hours before and he told us both he loved us. Thank you Tom for putting this out.
Thank you brother.  Your misic has touched me like no other!!   I really appreciate the true words!!!
I'm crying my eyes out my mom and aunt died from cancer and they tried there best to stay here with us but I will see them again in heaven. Thank you Tom very touching keep the songs coming your great your my favorite singer/rapper
My dad died a few years back from terminal brain cancer they say.
❤
These are the songs that I love to hear, it speaks about reality, what were all facing not just the artists 💓💓💓💓💓
Mad respect. Love this. My sister struggled with addiction nearly all her life. When she finally kicked it, she discovered 6 months later that she contracted HIV. Her drug problem was so severe that when she quit she fought seizures. Her HIV meds were causing problems with her seizure meds. Right about the time they got her straightened out, they found out she had cancer. The doctors told her that she could treat 2 of 3 but not all. Basically telling her she had to choose what she would die from. So after nearly 3 years of being clean and sober, she made her choice. She was found the next morning having chose to die from an overdose. I hope and pray that her dead end road was a private drive way and not a major thoroughfare. She was my baby sister and she will always be missed and loved.
Rip dad , aunt diane , aunt kathy , papaw , mamaw, and for my family still fighting
there are some songs that just hit different.. this was one of them. Absolutely amazing!
Tom I’ve lost a lot of family to cancer and half my family has and what you said is real shit the government could do more but they won’t cuz it’s all about the mighty dollar that’s the only thing that matters anymore it seems more valuable then life and it’s not right your music keeps me focused on what I have to do thanks grateful fan Michael thank you
Man, this dude is too fucking good
Wow I really Don’t have the Words, Good Song and thx for  bring awareness about cancer, had a tear and all kind of emotions. I watched my 16 year old Son  go through this I really could relate to the video. 8 months he went through it but in the end we lost him.
Please collab with Dr. Steven Greer and the unacknowledged movement 🙏❤ you're like the missing link.
So Tom ??? Do you believe in GOD??? Or Jesus??? Have you stopped sinning??? If so then your prayers will be powerful... but if you sin in spite of GOD... they have no power...
Did she survive though?
Great Song Tom. Well done.
🔥 🔥 🔥
Cringe
Didn't see that coming. You warned me id cry too.
Research 13.1 There is no money in a cure, the money's in hope=treatment. You already made the $. Tell this truth and they you won't need that vest....

👑
This deserves more views :(
Just give this man a fucking award already. Like damn. Cried my eyes out.
I lost my Grandmother about 2 years ago now to pancreatic cancer, only 9 weeks after diagnostic. The worst thing to ever happen to my family and me. Thank you for continuing to make music like this. It touches me and thousands and thousands of others out there. Keep up the amazing work Tom.
Damn bro..... Too much truth in just about everything you release.  Great song and I pray the industry doesn't get to you like it has so many others 🙏
Another amazing song
This is really good.
when I heard this it hit me deep my mom beat cancer so did my cousin but my aunt did not and I lost my aunt and 2 of my friends in 3 years from cancer they all fought till the end with the treatments and radiation just to lose the fight the 2 friends were husband and wife he died one year her the next it was sad and still is anyone going through this you are in my prayers. Thanks Tom for putting out music that has a message to it and not just the same old b.s. that on the radio today. Much love keep it up brother.
🥺😢😭
For the 1 in 100 that disliked this, you will never understand
Love this song You always get my respect 💯
Lost my father to cancer (myeloma) when I turned 18 and he was only 60. I'm 34 now... and sometimes I worry that half my life is over. He owned a home heating oil business but before that he worked for other heating oil companies, and at the time they used to do oil deliveries to homes without wearing gloves. The doctors suggested that maybe the oil seeped into his skin over the course of his life and caused the cancer. Myeloma is cancer of the blood cells.  But nobody really knows... I remember him sitting up in the hospital bed perfectly fine and asking me how I was doing in school (I wasn't doing well but I told him I was doing ok). He seemed full of life. Next time I saw him he was on life support and his body was completely covered in purple bruises. I hugged my mother and brother. I held his hand and couldn't stop crying... walked out of the room and a priest was there to pray for me.  They took my father off life support shortly after that. I can't avoid crying thinking back on it, even while I'm writing this. This song got me as well. When it was happening it was almost like I was in another dimension and this moment in my life completely changed everything. I never thought I'd lose my father... he was the light at family parties and always making everyone laugh. Every holiday after that you could feel the void he left in the air
My family friend had cancer. He beat it than got it again he is currently fighting it now and is doing well.
Shot me in the heart with this one. Damn Tom.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is why.....hangover gang forever Tom!
Man this is amazing you done great this will definitely help everyone keep it real tom your amazing man
Wow!! Love it!!.... as usual lol
Today is actually the day my mother passed away from cancer. 8 years today. I was 17 and it's was like a shot in the chest. Thank you Tom. Ps I think my mom would have liked your music.
Scientist: I FOUND THE CURE FOR CANCER! Government: That's real cool and all but, imagine all the money we could make  *STILL RESEARCHING THE CURE FOR CANCER*
My boi

Tom, you will never know how deep this song hit me, my aunt is currently losing ground in this battle... fuck dude.. hits are deep.. thank you

Facts
#TomMcDonaldGang
I swear the more you listen to this song the more religious it gets.    There are no Gods, afterlife, immortality, or anything of the sort.    Faith isn't a tool for grief management and Jesus never existed and can't help you.   If you have strength to fight through it was always within you, and the people around you might've helped to bring it out .   Your are strong, worthy, and valuable without a God to heal you or accept you.    Your value comes from your actions not from some being who you are told calls your a sinner.    You do make mistakes, but you don't need a God's help to fix them.  You are stronger than you know because Gods don't exist so even your imagined help from God is because of your inner strength and the help of people around you.   Also in some cases the placebo effect.
Real shit! Lately feels like it's been the same, let's get some Everybody hates me / politically incorrect inspiration for the next song. Love ya tom and ty!
What a special guy you are Tom. About made me cry before bed. All the best on your future endeavors.
December 3, 2018 3:17pm RIP Dad

Dope
Tom thank you and love ya brother 🙏🙏🙏
As of my current viewing of this video the 433 dislikes are all useless pieces of hating trash who will do anything to feel better about their ego getting hurt because he raps about topics that actually mean something rather than rapping about drugs and money. Awesome work as always Tom and Nova. I see you Logan good stuff. Also been a fan since YouTube showed me Sad Rappers in an ad however long ago that was.
Bruh this hits me hard my grandmother passed of lung cance 2 years ago
This is the song
Watching as I am drinking and smoking. Fucking stupid. Maybe a wake up call
I knew it was comin🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥keep it 💯homie that’s why we love ya !!! One of the best preachers I’m hearing right now 💪💪wooooooo man that’s some tuff stuff brother😭well done man well done!!!
Earlier i just listened to this song on spotify and was like oh this is a great song but then I just had to chance to watch this music video and like I wanted to cry cuz my older sister went thru cancer and like shes alive and a fighter this hit hard
I feel that Tom is one of the only people who would do this
Hit song
My mom died of cancer tom mcdonald is a legend
I hate rap, but this song... I love this song... This song hits somewhere special. Tom, keep up the good work, and keep your music wholesome as you are.
As a cancer survivor thank you this song touches the heart.
BEST BEST EVER
Good Lookin' out for the infected.  Chemo therapy was developed in the 1950's, and 70 years later it's still the best they can do? And none of them can pin point what is causing it. Let me help.  It's the toxic chemicals they put in our food, water, air, healthcare products.  Everything that has a label product that needs a PHD to decipher. That! That is what is causing cancer. Ask Masanto, the leading company that started in 1919 making every toxic chemical ever made. The makers of DEET and Agent Orange and Napalm.  For which every victim of these chemicals died of cancer. And now the leading manufacturer of GMO corn and beans, think about that the next time you sit down in the morning to eat your favorite breakfast cereal.   Mmm mmm a bowl full of cancer, part of your daily requirements.   I know because I'm in Illinois a faming community.  Their corn is everywhere around me. In fact right now it's harvest time, farmers are taking it down, kicking all that toxic dust into the air.  Our grainery is drying the corn in heated dryers, which blow grain dust all over my community. We wash our cars because of it, constantly, we call it 'red eye', because if you get the dust in your eye it will be as red as the devil's dick. My uncle worked at the grainery and almost went blind in one eye just because of a simple little flake got under his eyelid. Your biggest worry right now is a flu called COVID 19,  we have to worry about toxic dust from your food source. And don't think your safe eating meats either, left over corn gets feed to pigs and cows. Mmmmmmmm mmm. Eat up.  And our government leaders have been very well paid to look the other way, including the FDA.  We are all going to die of cancer. Because that's what "They" want. And so it will be.  Other wise why would Obama sign the Masanto Protection Act Then as soon as Trump gets in, he let it lapse and the people were allowed to sue Masanto again. You know you have seen those commercials for lawyers sueing Round-Up, one the shell companies of Masanto.
Love you Jill... You're such a strong woman. Tom got your back now too because you're a fighter.
Tom is just a legend no doubt
This gave me motivation to quit everything cancer causing
I would like to know the 440 dumbasses that downloaded you ?? nice positive song
You did good, bros.
Thank you.
RIP Dad. Love and miss you, man :/
Reading all these comments about people's parents passing away from cancer makes me feel really bad because my mom survived cancer twice
Bravo brother.. not gonna lie.. I wasnt always a fan.. but ur growth as an artist has been more than impressive man.. keep em comin
This has got to be one of the most inspirational song I’ve ever heard...Tom McDonald again continues to amaze me....Keep it up!
I pray every night I will see my family again 🙏 I love you all God Blesa you beautiful people.💯
There’s this thing that my family has used for cancer I gotta ask my mom for the name but it’s cured our friends cancer, my uncles and my companion pets kind of a shame that it’s not put out there as much however that’s kind of a good thing at the same time
Beautiful soul
Tom, your words are FELT NOT HEARD! I cant explain how much you make us feel. Keep on keepin on
My grandpa recently died of cancer. Weird world
Fantano fans be like “I’ve had cancer Tom blew this way out of proportion🙄”  Keep at it Tom this was awesome, your music just keeps getting better and better. #hangovergang
My grandma was with me when no one else was and now she is dying of lung cancer and I don't wanna lose her please please pray for grandma Debbie❤
This is why we fucking LOVE you dude! You don't stand by while you can stand up,.💛🙏🙌 HANGOVERGANG4EVER 💥🖕🤙
This is reality 😭😭
💔 this kills me
ANOTHER TRUTH!!!! You touch us all Tom MacDonald. Truth, inspiration, hope and FIGHT!
THE CURE IS BREATH FOOD AND LOVE
For someone who is going through stage 3 gastric lymphoma for the second time thank you for this song tom. Currently been in the hospital for over a month fighting. It's hard doing it alone and lost my job to covid so no insurance right now. It feels impossible
Wow❤❤❤ so true
It's sad how people still dislike such wonderful song as this. Where I come from, such people are called “bad belle” (enemies of progress).  One of your biggest fan from 🇳🇬🇳🇬 Keep winning, Tom 💪💪💯💯💯
Big pharmaceutical: there's no money in cures.   Shit the last thing that was "cured" was polio. And every day seem like there is a new med or shot.
Beautiful
"Nothing matters if you don't have your health, All the money in the world doesn't help"  "And you don't know what you can take, Till you realize you didn't break"  While not cancer, I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease 11 years ago. 5 years ago, I got real bad, weighed 82lbs, relied on a feeding tube to not wither away for a year. Had my colon and gallbladder removed 6 months apart. Almost bled out during the gallbladder procedure. I've literally been ripped apart and put together and have bounced back.   Thank you, Tom. This song really resonates with me, but in a different kind of way. 🤙🏻
Anyone who dislikes a video like this, put your hate aside and understand this isn't about politics, this isn't about your views, this isn't about you hating the guy; this is a powerful video that deserves love because a lot of us have gone through, know someone who has, and lost them in the process. He reveals truth that we all need to listen to. Mad respect for this man for this song. I have a grandmother who had breast cancer 🎀 and I thank God everyday cancer didn't take her. Everyone going through it or knows someone going through it, I pray for their recovery.
I see they going to let him Trend properly let's get the number one spot go Tom
This song is amazing!!! U weren't lying when u said we would all be crying. My dad was diagnosed with a very aggressive small cell lung cancer 2 yrs ago and given 8 yrs to live. He went thru chemo and radiation. Had his annual big appt and everything is great.. no new growth.. nothing has spread.. God is good!!! Thanks Tom!!! Ur awesome!!!
This one is a real one. RIP Dad #1.
You are absolutely incredible when it comes to writing music. You say what so many wish to say. You speak truth, and talk about real issues in life. I think your amazing
Over 400 dislikes!! Are you kidding me. 40% of these haters are going to have cancer eventually and they're going to have this song as number one on their playlist. Tom this is a very remarkable song. On behalf of all the fans you have we love the f*** out of you man.
Let's go my boy Tom is a legend him and my family is what is making me stand up to bullys
The good might go to Heaven and the bad might go to hell, but no one wants to leave here, you can tell!!!  Wow.....
Truth............
Thanks for your music Tom... You've saved me more times than you'll ever know. Love ya bro keep doing your thing. 💯
Holy shit this was powerful. Thank you tom... Forever fan from pa
❤😢😭, I loved it Tom,  I lost my daddy to lung cancer that spread to his brain in 1991 he was 56yrs old and i was 26yrs old.. Cancer sucks(so does emphysema cause i lost my mom in 1993 and she was only 54yrs old)..i really believe that there's a cure for everything but big pharma is greedy and they want that money..
There probably is a cure for Cancer and these sick bastards want to keep it from us... Thank you, Tom, for being honest as always...
Man.... this was powerful to say the very least Tom. Bro, you're one of the best in Hip Hop history yo! Stay real!
Good job amen tom cancer sux
You can see the pain in his eyes and face.. this guy has such a big heart and a genuine soul, which is so rare these days.. I can’t understand why people don’t like him, for real..
Tom you've always created some deep videos but this one really hits home. I don't know a single person who doesn't know someone that has passed away from cancer. Keep up the good work
WOW!! Powerful song! Thanks Tom!
Ninjas cutting onions. This week is an annual hell for me. Not cancer, but this hit so damn close to home. You are an amazing man Tom. Thank you for this video and song.
Start watching at 34:17 children in danger   https://www.bitchute.com/video/6cG4jh7o5R3f/
Not what I expected when I click on this.  Respect that is all.
THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THIS MEANS
Y not bring up Rick Simpson himself and/or Rick Simpson Oil!? Did u forget about him when making the lyrics!? Or what .. u never heard of him!?
Bros why do you think the medical symbol is 2 snakes on a staff!!!! Fucking think about it
2 years ago I went through 36 weeks of radiation and surgery for stage 1 bowel cancer at age 33. This song hit so close to home, I really wish this had come out then cause there is such a mental battle to keep up positivity and hope.   I have always liked Tom's work but there are no words I can express towards the respect you have earned with this track. Big ups bro
My mom was just diagnosed with cervical cancer this hit me
Hits me hard as my dad is battling this now.
Two words.   Thank you.
Something worth trending in 2020. Can we make this number 1!?
real talk Tom!! keep it up man! Big pharma hates you !! haha fuck the world they got the cures for everything
You're a treasure Tom
Lost my parents to cancer and my best friend of 30+years. My brother had breast cancer. The 30th of this month will be a year since his surgery. He went through chemo and radiation and is cancer free. Thank you for this video❤️
Look I did have cancer. They found it in my neck. My thyroid was as big as a soccer ball when they took it out. Chemo sucks. And I know how it feels. So to the people who are going through that right now and the families that have to see this first hand I say this to y'all... The lord has got us. And there is nothing he can't or wont do for his children. He had my hand the whole way, and just know he has y'alls. #hangovergangstrong.
Every one of your songs effects me in some way or the other. For some reason this one effected me so much more. Maybe it’s because I’m getting married tomorrow to a woman who is much younger than me and knowing that my entire family dies of cancer. It’s in our genetics. Right now my dad is the oldest living one out of 13 siblings which have all died off.
Absolutely love this song. I'm fighting a rare stage 4 cancer. And the damn treatments are horrible. Thank you for this song
This made me cry!! thank you Tom!!! 💔❤
Watching my dad get eaten by cancer was the hardest thing i have ever had to deal with.   I will never forget the day he died and the way his face looked after they took his oxygen mask off, i had not seen his full face in 2 weeks and i did not recognize him.  Tom, you are one of the best lyricist of our generation.  Keep growing my friend. Much love from Ontario.
now why did you have to go and make me cry :(( but thank you for the beautiful message
Dam, I could feel that one.
Oh no
Damn man, I saw this on an ad and I watched this all the way through and it had me in tears. God bless you for this, I know a lot of people are going to find strength in this. Keep doing your thing Tom! And fuck you cancer!
🔥🔥✅✅🤚🏽🤚🏽❤️❤️
Really good job tom I can't believe the people that have disliked it like wtf is wrong with some people
Thank you so much! I'm sending this to my dad! He has stage 3 brain cancer and really needs this!🖤❤
I love how awake tom is and knows alot of real information and trying to tell everyone else through songs.
Im over here crying, thanks you for helping so many of us ,LOVE You Tom.
I died for 5 minutes in the hospital 4 minutes and 6 the last time had 3 heart attacks and complete lung collapse as well at losing 6 pints of blood. I spent 30 days in a coma I did see something but it’s not worth seeing. All I can say is God and the devil are not the only ones that run the show.
Thank you for making this song I've lost 4 family members to cancer and the all fought hard   Ps I'm crying right know
Why has it been that the government not stop making pharmaceutical stop making pills side effects? Oh wait the pharmaceutical put fat wades of cash in their pockets to keep looking the other way. When are we going to put a stop to this. Why do we keep voting in the evil? What would happen if we just stop paying taxes and stop voting? When I are we going to put term limits on palpitations? When are we going to stand up and same no more? Then does not mean riots or walking. What if we all just didn’t go to work, shop or spend any money for one week?
That's why you live life to the fullest
Thank you for making this Tom. Lost my mom a little over a month ago. I miss her and this all hits home. Keep doing great things. Fan for life.
Need and want to make music with u bro. Sinseer E.R.
Fuck brother, the feels in this one. Thank you.  Love you brother. Stay safe stay healthy.
This is Crazy u need to learn how to beat box
0:46 what's on her forehead? If that's a bald cap it's terribly done... Love the song though. Thanks for speaking about shit most rappers don't, Tom.
To the 1 person who's reading this: You're very intelligent and adorable human! Stay healthy during this kinda quarantine 💕 💫
#HangOverGang
I'm not crying you are crying.
You’re amazing. Honestly
#Hang    Over    Gang
Lost my mom to this shiz. Thought the same while we was goin through it...
Thank you for the amazing music you write/produce! Your a absolutely incredible artist you deserve everything that you have earned! This song is incredible and hit home big time I lost my dad to cancer almost 14 years ago along with my grandmother 12 years ago and my grandfather last year. Cancer runs strong in my family on my dads side. I believe this song will give everyone fighting cancer hope and shine a light in the darkness they are facing. Lots of love to you and nova 💕
GOD DAM IT TOM!! Not sure this man can every fail!! Fire as always G . . . 1000000 HOG!!
This one seperates the men from the boys. This is pure heart and i love every second of it. Disliking this video literally tells me all i need to know about you.
Respect Tom!
‼️‼️‼️Go watch the official trailer for the fall of UTM/BFR music 🎶 out now on my channel run ‼️‼️‼️🔞🔞🔞🔞
Lost my mom a little over a year ago to small cell lung cancer that eventually spread to her brain.i hope my daughter doesn't have to see me like I saw my mom after the treatments.id rather be told the odds and let me choose to live or die cause I really wish I had a better last image of my mom before she died.its not pretty to see some1 you love look the way they do after the chemo and radiation.it broke my heart to see her like that.the way she would look at me trying to figure out who I was hurt my soul.some cancer just isn't worth fighting but he's right every1 is scared about what happens after we die so we will do anything to live.as far as the big pharma companies they can all go to hell.i know there's a cure for at least some types of cancer but unless you're rich you will never see it.its always a matter of how much is your life worth to ya.
Your awesome
I cannot understand the thumbs down on this song the ones who thumbs down do not like to hear the truth but to know that we can heal cancer with energy and vibration but the pharmaceuticals won't let it happen that's the thing and honestly my post will probably be taken down because of what I said speak the truth Tom McDonald keep doing your light work shine bright never stop
Hell yeah man. Keep up the great work bro.
Am I the only one crying rn that hit too deep the best songs are when u can feel them thru ur own emotion
Thank u my is dieing from this it mean so much to me I know going be so hard on me when he gone
Songs like this are like voice of truth of an Angel to many. Cheers Tom for the great work. Changing many lives and a light for many. Respect from Australia mate. Your fans are huge down under
This in a way im glad im not a parent because if my kid died before me I wouldn't be able to keep living!!!
Thanks tom
Cancer sucks. But if it doesnt kill you, something else will
Keep spitin facts
For everyone who disliked this I take you support cancer and don't give a flying shit about giving strength and encouragement to those fighting one of the hardest battles anyone or any family can go through when they need it screw you
This song is sooo fucking real.
.
Great chorus Tom. Powering and moving!
Awesome song man! I lost my father to prostate cancer when I was 11, he was a WWII veteran who survived  the Pearl Harbor attacks!! There as so many truth in this song! They say we can do this or this and this to prolong life, but in the end it's all about the money to the drs and pharmaceutical companies!
No bs you made my eyez water with this sone because youre so real. Thank you
Love it Tom.   Comin from a 50 yr. Old hard rocker.
"We've been paying them to kill ourselves"...wow!
Dang. I had cancer for 9 years. Luckily I am now 5 years free. Song is tough
Facts
Great song I mist it yesterday but we had to listen together ❤ keep it up
I had cancer 12 years ago I was 13.....this hit hard as fuck
You dropped another one!! This is deep man! Ive been talking about this for a long time and it really bothers me that we can clone organs in a petri dish but we cant kill a cancer cell? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
Hey Tom I’ve been Listening to your music for a little while and some of it hits me where I’m at in life right now but this song really touched me I lost my father a year and a half ago to cancer lung cancer he was only 52 and it’s something that I pray for people every day for them to find a cure and this last year and a half has been one big Roller coaster most of it has been downhill I hope this song makes you a lot of money for the reason that you wrote it for people Who get a sickness that is terrible and you may never read this or somebody else may read this who’s in a rough spot
Truth! This is why I love you & your music!
Saddest, scariest,most beautiful song. thank you
I list my brother to cancer one year ago. Miss him every day
this sir is worthy of my valuable comment time, i have listened to much of you content without the urge to comment but today... that has all changed, top job !
The cure is stem cells. Get rid of the cancer and repair with stem cells
Made a lyric video for this song! This song is so true. Cancer sucks 🥀❤️
my best friend lost her mom to cancer a few months ago. she’s only 13. my heart aches for her, I don’t know what I would do if I were in her situation. and during COVID too, only a few people could go to the funeral. please pray for her.
Deep bro
This is what we need, somebody with hope, not hate.
Cancer is such a scam from the big pharma companies, their own products are the leading cause of cancer, it's disgusting...
Awesome song Tom, and awesome video Nova!!!
Fuxxx, this song makes me wanna vomit from how real it is....
As a cancer Survivor and the person who lost their mother to lung cancer. Thank you for this Tom. We need fighting music to listen too when we going thur the worst. Thank you.
Great words Tom. Love you guys.
Thanks for this! After being sick for 3 years and nobody knowing what was wrong with me, I got diagnosed with thyroid cancer. I had my thyroid quickly removed and then my husband lost his job 2 weeks later so we have had to deal with my healing along with frantically searching for work so we can get medical coverage for the last month. My dad just finished treatment for prostate cancer about 3 months ago as well. Stressful as eff but i'd like to think this is just going to make us stronger in the long run. This too shall pass! My dad and I are alive and still fighting so I am thankful!
@Tom Macdonald hey bro just want to say man this is like 3 or 4 song you got me crying to bro my I have some one battling cancer right now man it's like you said got to pretend the shits not real to cope. But just want to say bro keep up the great work man keep telling the truth about shit and keep just doing you. You really speak to every body in a great way and you are one of my top 10 artist of all time keep being you you will will be one of the greats. Your a great artist. Just wanted to let you know man hooe you see this
My grandma has stage 4 melanoma and the doctors miss diagnosed her 6 times and it spread all over her body the doctors are the ones that made her sicker this song hits home😭❤️
Omg 🥲🥲🥲❤️❤️❤️
Never in my life has a song hit so deep. THANK YOU TOM! You made a true fan for life off this one.
"Damn Tom!" Literal quote every other bar to not cry lol. Awesome song!!!!
He's  speaking facts and truth how corrupt the heathcare system really is 👀💯
Bro this song strikes close to home. Thanks for all you do keep up with the amazing tracks
Kids dying of cancer is one of the reasons I became an atheist. Shit makes no sense. I really want to believe, but the evidence just isn't there
People hate on your looks and it destroys the idea of judging people by appearance. I am a die hard Christian, but also a drug addict. Your words are so powerful. I can't state it enough. You have these good messages without cursing every other word. Again I used to sell meth so I am not shy from swearing but I understand the impact of having a corrupt mind. You don't know why you have faith till you look the devil in the face. I DID THAT. As a homeless meth addict at one point. I know work corporate with a wonderful job and it was because I started living with the Spirit, you can call in conscience, and things changed. I lived as IF the Christians were right and things changed. I can't explain it. We live in a corrupt/ evil world towards the end. I pray for you and hope you continue what you are doing.
Yeah, I get that, but it’s the population’s fault, they the ones that need to wake up.
Goddamn man. Every song u make is either a straight vibe or it touches my soul or both. Your the real deal man, HOG forever. Love you brother 😎
Damn this hit close to home. My best friend and my hero when I was younger is still fighting the fight. He is also my father. My kids see him as a old weak man, I still see him as he was.
You’re right tom it is hard but it’s very unfortunate that people have donated to cancer for a very long time And there’s still no cure. And it’s sad because there is a cure I’m sure. But unfortunately it doesn’t make anybody any money that’s what it’s about money. The root of all evil. It’s not having money that’s evil it’s looking at money as it’s a god what it can buy. I think I would be afraid to have a Lotta money. Because Riches make people forget that there’s people that are hurting don’t have the option to even have a home of their own. But are still happy just the same. and trust that their Lord and Savior will get them through. And he always does. And by you making this video. Proves that you really care about people and what they go through. I know somebody knows there’s a cure for cancer. There has to be. Trillions of dollars that have been donated to cancer research come on. People are suffering and it’s all about the all mighty dollar. God help us.
I asked myself the same question this week.. We can spend millions and find a vaccin for Corona in a couple of months, but we have been fighting cancer for centuries..  Nobody talks about it, glad we now have Tom!
Thank you so much, I’ve lost everyone close to me from Cancer. I appreciate you . #fuckcancer
This man is an angel in our times! Spreads nothing but truth to the core! The story behind all of his songs are so much truth
cornball
I remember slowly watching an aunt die as I grow closer to her. Every night praying with my grandma. Tom the realest for making ❤
Mad respect Tom. You’re changing music for better. ✊🏽💯❤️
Lost my daughter at 37yrs old 5 kids breast cancer. Awesome song. Tears for mine and yalls loved ones. May god heal n bless all fighting and never give up. Thank you tom
I lost my uncle in 2003 when i was 10 he was a very big rolemodel to me i think about him everyday this brought me back to the last time i saw him sitting in a chair with a beanie over his head he wss bald from the chemo this was hard to listen to but thank you for making it
Damn you got some serious talent bro
Tom wrote another song about himself
As a cancer survivor, this speaks to me on a whole nother level. Thank you Tom♥️
Tom i dont kjow hownu do this but honestly u hit fifferent then anyone else. Ur words are a story u r a genuine person and i respect u so much. U really outdid urself this time.

Hit kinda close to home as my mom died of cancer last month. Still wish I had more time I could have spent with her.
Wow, this is just amazing, thank you Tom for expressing you, so many people are going to relate to this song, probably the first song in a long time that has made me truly cry, it really hit home. So thank you Tom, Nova, Logan and Evan for all the hard work you all put into creating such art. But a massive thank you to Tom, keep being you man and you will go so far.
I really like this song..  what means the most, is to see you actually speak the truth about Everything
1:29 everybody has cancer now? Oookay? There was a lot of good stuff in this song but some of this is straight garbage
I've thought this for years, they've probably found the cure a long time ago, but cancer research is one of the most lucrative industries, its a gold-mine. The cure is probably available to the mega-rich
he sounds like a idiot, going after doctors when in reality its the companies who make the medications the doctor prescripts.
I was given six months to live nine years ago from stage III in operable lung cancer and given less than a 20% chance of living through the treatment cannabis absolutely saved my life !!!the song hit me like a ton of bricks and yes made me cry a little . Keep rocking them out brother much love
Awesome song.
Great song bro, it touches me deeply cuz I lost my grandfather to brain cancer. Keep doin what you do 🔥
i lost my grandmother when she had cancer, when i heard about it, i couldn't stop crying cause she died from it 😢😭
Truly an incredible artist with heart and compassion. Thank you for speaking up about popular topics that others shy away from.
Why is this tryhard cringe trending?
Great job maybe doing one on bullying go tom McDonald
agree or not they have the cure to cancer
Damn brother way to knock it out of the park. Thank you and nova
If you know Jesus, you WILL know where you go when you die. It’s never too late to see Him. It’s paradise, greater than anything we can imagine!  Best of luck to everyone <3
I honestly haven't cried this much like i lost my mom to cancer this just home really really hard
After chemo+radiation and a double mastectomy, my mom is a breast cancer survivor. Every word of this touched me. It's truth. Thank you yet again Nova and Tom.
This is one of the best things he could have covered and talked about I just lost my grandma in one night to blood cancer
Dang homie real talk, no other words
Thank you for this. I lost my mom after a three and a half year battle with breast cancer in 2019. Bless you.
This some dumb shit lmao
❤❤❤
U got into my feels.
Wow...(slow clap....and a quick wipe of the tears).  Well done, sir!
Damn how many people wouldn't think of listening to this song will miss out on too much
I lost my dad last month to brain cancer, and he was the strongest and hardest working person I knew, I watched him become so weak he couldnt walk and his head hurt so bad he was almost in tears, 30 years I knew him and as sad as it is to say, I was sort of glad when he went because the pain was gone, the humiliation he felt from not being able to take care of himself was gone, I hope he is at peace, RIP dad I Miss you.
Every time someone finds the cure..... they disappear, is that heard though?
Damn
This song makes me cry
does your name really have mcdonalds in iy
Howdy from Australia. Love your work. Everything you sing comes from the heart. You are a true wordsmith  and a down to earth human. Keep up the good work. Who would have thought that I would love a rapper. Rock on mate.
For real, God Bless you.
Thx  tom  .. ive lost my parents ..
I think you just saved my life...
Tom Macdonald trying to make us cry today. 😥
Love the songs keep it up
❤️
nice directing, Nova.
Thank you Tom for this song, made me cry, cause my Mom has.stage four cancer,dont want to lose her😢
🎗🎗👍👍 Hodgkin's Survivor 17 years 💪💪...THANKS MAN GOOD STUFF..
THANK YOU for this song!! My teenage son was diagnosed and treated for brain cancer this year. The hardest thing I’ve ever experienced after also losing my mom young to cancer. 🎗💛🎗💛
Good nutrition fights cancer and disease.
🔥🔥🔥🔥 Thank you for this
Damn it bruh this one hit me, that’s one of my fears as a father. My son getting sick and I can’t do nothing about it. Peace and love to everyone.
Very cool brotha!!
Wow man. Really powerful.
This is what is actually needed especially now more than ever. All human. 💙
If this don't hit you then you never experienced the horrifying uncertainty of being in this situation. The absolute numbness that leaves you feeling blindsided after you get that phone call. And worst of all, feeling so fucking helpless. I hope but hope it isn't possible that people would do something like withhold a cure for cancer because treatment is looked at as a revenue of income. The people that withheld it would be hunted down like a modern witch hunt. The vigilante groups wouldn't give a fuck about justice, it would be pure violent revenge that nothing could stop. If every American citizen over 18 united as a civilian militia then even the actual military would join the citizens. Imagine what a 1 million man army would look like...now add two more zeroes to that. 100,000,000 armed militiamen fighting the ones in power of their country couldn't be stopped.  If you bombed em, you'd be bombing your own country and not even doing much damage.  If you nuke us then they destroyed what they controlled which would be nothing anymore.  It's time for the guillotines.  If you don't think that something like 10 million people with the same mission could force the elite or nobility to walk themselves to the raised boards to be decapitated than you don't know history. French Revolution all over again but with bigger numbers and angrier causes...shiiiiit.
You dont know what you can take until you realize you didnt break. Damn that fucking hits a certain way
There ain't many songs that can just make you tear up this is one of them tho. Lost my grandma to breast cancer she beat it the first round and came back with a vengeance the second time. Love you gma Karen
Legit chills...
How you going to dislike this? Special place in hell
Deep
Omg I wish I could like this over and over!! Thank you Tom Macdonald!!
I hope he doesn’t get destroyed like all the other rappers he knows the secrets
You are a fighter🤞 Thanks Tom for setting the example for other artists 💪🏼 #watsrong🦋
The ability to channel emotions and feelings and connect thru them is A Truly Unique Blessing the You and Nova both have a plethora of.
S/o to one of the realest rappers out here
Don’t ever stop doing what ur doing brother. ✌🏻❤️&🤘🏻Skål 🍻
This Song and I wish bring a tear to my eye every time. Thank you for the truth you bring to the world.♥️
THIS IS WHY THIS MAN SHOULD BE PRESIDENT
My cuz
No offense but if you knew how cancer worked you wouldn't be surprised why it's so hard to cure. The industry would also make crazy money off a cure, it's just really fucking hard to cure your body fighting itself
Bro, this one hits hard! Lost my mom, 28 years ago.  Thank you!!!
Awesome Tom im glad I found your music and yeah some of its "CORNY" lol but I can tell you put yourself into this and I think thats why people connect with your songs. I can see alot of people will be able to connect with this song and your just gonna keep blowing up. Just please don't lose yourself along the way.
He is my favorite rapper because he speaks the truth and everything
Very moving, wow.
I like the song and most people know some one that’s had cancer. I have. You’ve gotta admit though that he knows what people feel strongly about and pushes that narrative. Right/Left hate, now cancer that everyone hates. Hey he knows what works.
Utmost respect to you Tom✊ you spit straight truth in more ways than any other rapper i know of
Bro so deap and heart felt I've never heard a single rap song dedicated to cancer u are a bad ass thank you for being you wow love this song
\m/ Powerful & True...love u bro!!...& yes love u 2 Nova...peace!!
Well you were right... Made me cry.
You are a very inspiring and speak nothing but the truth! God sent his son to solve the problem of where we go when we pass!
Why they acting like that girl at the start wasn't wearing a wig already? Makes the whole video very disingenuous.
My aunt just passed on 9/17/20 from multiple cancers. Thank you Tom.
my ex wife just recently passed away from cancer and not even a couple months later my mom was diagnosed with cancer! CANCER SUCKS
You're right..  I cried.. no one I know has it but if it ever happens... Fuck Cancer
Always great. I would love to see a video to My life sucks. That's another one that a lot of us relate to. this song is very touching and classy. Cheers big man.
This song is so relatable several people in my family had cancer
“McDonald’s diss tracks Burger King with new diss track “cancer”.
It’s probably already cured. Look at all the a list actors and important people none of them have had it for a long time.
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! WON'T LIE, I CANT GET INTO SOME OF THE CORNY SHIT YOU DO BUT 98 % OF YOUR MUSIC IS TRULY PHENOMENAL. PLEASE DONT STOP TOM.  LUV ALL!
I only had a 20% chance of surviving and i accepted death but i survived and now every breath i take is sweeter than the last i had four kids after i was truly blessed i may not have money and a nice or a car but i have love. I fight more bravely and love more fiercely than i did before i seen kids die and moms cry whole family's torn apart. We are Warriors #FIGHTON
Thanks bro im fighting rare appendix cancer
You make so many good points , I'm happy that i can listen to someone who speaks the truth God bless :)  im 16 btw
Thank you so much for making this Tom I have recently lost 3 family members not far from each other to cancer...  thank you
💪🏽top tom! Keep them coming! Louder, faster and harder!
This really hit home on this one Tom. Well all your music does but recently my father was diagnosed with cancer. Keep up the incredible work bro.
Lost a 10 year old Nephew 13 yrs back. The little man fought for 5 years. Ty St Jude In Seattle/ Mcdonald house.
Never.  NEVER donate to any cancer funds or foundations.  They're a scam.  There are many, many natural cures for cancer that have existed before the medical establishment and pharmaceutical industry have.
334 people make money off cancer
Currently trending and you deserve it bro keep up the good videos your a very talented artist
Great Topic we Thank You Mr.McDonald GOD Bless.
THIS RIGHT HERE SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO MY HEART, AFTER LOSING MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS AND MY LITTLE BOY TO CANCER IN 2017 THIS REALLY HIT HARD. THANK YOU TOM FOR YET ANOTHER MASTERPIECE
Damn it. This one hits really hard having lost someone who was like my 2nd mom and also makes me proud to have met such a strong woman.
Bro I can't wait to hear your music for many years to come... I can't actually let my kids listen to this music... And not only that but I can actually use this to teach them..  thanks Bro
Tom love what you are doing. Stay honest.
I've lost many family members to terminal illnesses including this one. Brought a tear to my eye with this one, and I thought music couldn't evoke this kind of emotion anymore. Bravo man.
F CANCER!!!
The best definition of a survivor. Thank you for the song and love and if you are fighting cancer keep on!
Beautiful songwriting! Amen
YES!!! This is your music that I love! Keep speaking those truths! I was lucky enough that they caught my cervical cancer early and were able to remove it. I still worry that it may come back one day, but I haven't let that stop me from living. I am now 4 months pregnant with our baby after a miscarriage 2 years ago. This song brought me to tears. I love your words, Tom! Please don't ever change!
Tom MacDonald and I just want to send this note to you you put this song on YouTube the day that my wife’s Nana died of brain cancer and I just wanna let you know that you really did help the family with this song I don’t even know you you don’t know me but I just wanna let you know that Jesus put you on this earth for a reason and you were doing it thank you
Hey Tom. This song already hit hard when I first heard it on gravestones. I have a very dear friend who is fighting cancer. I hope she wins. I love her. I love her a lot
My younger brother was diagnosed at 13 years old. He beat the cancer at 14, but relapsed in his last month of remission. He was cancer free at 15 years old until the side effects of the treatment killed him. He died of radiation poisoning at 15. Thank you Tom.
Now he's exploiting cancer patients
love you tom x
Beautiful
If he wrote this, good in your face type technique..your being honest
THIS SONG IS FIRE! GOOD JOB YOU 2!
Dear Tom I know you will not respond to this but you have really hit home for me!!! My mom is a 21 year survivor of breast cancer!!!! But unfortunately my dad who had no medical conditions died of cancer 10 years ago this past kApril. 9 days before my birthday. I was daddy’s baby girl!!! Life is too short no matter how old you are!!! That being said life is too short so why in the world have you not proposed to Nova? You 2 were made for each other!!!  You have been through hell and still have been by each others side!!!  I can’t wait to see you get on that one knee!!!
my Grandma passed last February to breast cancer and my grandfather had a stroke around 7 or 8 years ago. He has to live at home by himself.
Survival rates are not too bad. Around 70%. The problem is our government in the USA regulates healthcare so much you can’t even create a start up unless you have a billion dollars.
Imagine being a hater this guy rocks
This dude is one good artist
They don't want to end it bc they make SO much money off people. It's fucking sad and pisses me off that money rules this world.
Much respect, you sing about the truth , and your lyrics are your ammo....keep it up....
Bro from the bottom of my heart, thank you. I really needed this.
This is music. This is what music/rap/hip hop is suppose to be about. Not this mumble bullshit. I tip my hat to you tom. Keep spreading your music, never stop.
This song hits close to home. One of your best. Keep it up man we all love you bro.
Thank you for your voice in this war that ive been fighting for 16 years i had osteosarcoma bone cancer when i see a cancer patient i dont see a frail sick person i see a WARRIOR #FIGHTON
Come on guys. We need to get him to #1. His message is so fire and true. Hit that that thumbs up and share this 💩
You right i cried like a baby! Ty Tom and Nova
this song it me right in my heart.. cried when I heard it. lost both parents to cancer. my dad when I was 5 and my mom when I was 24. now 6 years ago my husband got diagnosed. I love the true honesty of your songs!
Glad to see this on trending. Deserves to be #1
Lost my uncle to cancer this year. #CANCERSUCKS.
This was hard to watch because I’ve lost 3 aunts to different forms of cancer and the latest being just last night. It’s rough.
Tom first of all thank you so much. Cancer is kinda a taboo subject which nobody wants to talk about or look at. I had cancer and surgery in 2011 that removed it but Drs said I have Lynch syndrome and 80% chance to get other cancers and some ppl have cancer few times or until death. I still have plenty health problems as well as 2 kids that have a 50% chance to get what I have. Just now seen ur video and had to watch several times and still going as I cry every time cuz of how real u are. Plz don't stop ur awesome, and huge fan. Seriously it helps and much needed as the fire rages but hidden under my own demons. Also I missed an app so lost my disability for 2 yrs and I'm giving up. Not sure what to say at this point but mainly after dealing with this for 9 yrs Ive felt like a lost cause and an obligation to everyone around me. The more I listen the more I cry but for good reasons, I'm being reminded of the fire inside and facing the devil face to face and now I'm only one holding myself and family back. Will forever jam this song as well as ur others but this one is bringing me back to the fight I need to have for my children as well as myself. Again and very very seriously..... Thank you so much!
Don't give up!!! All survivors are the strongest people on this earth!
MY FATHER JUST DIED in AUG of CANCER   He was only 62  he was diagnosed 1 yesr after he retired. 2 years later he is gone    Im dead inside   Thank you for making this song
Beautiful man the only way I can describe this 💓
Number 8 on trending...bout time they stop shadow banning tom...love you guys hog fam, tom and nova and the pups love sent from the mcmillins in Missouri
Dude I remember hearing this when I first listen to your CD, it's a tough song to listen to and not feel sad and hopeful. Thanks for what you do my man
Just lost a friend to cancer. 😩😢😢😭 All because of stupid Money man... the industry doesn't care about Really healing people.. screw radiation...
Something tells me this goin be on the radio
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Greetings from Mexico
Bro I hope you hit #1 on trending so damn bad. 💪🏼💪🏼
Ceo of cancer been real silent lately
Speechless....that touched my soul, the God gene that science can't sequence...and I pray they never do....unless it cures cancer
Crying like leaking waterbed
Absolutely beautiful Tom. ❤
I've been trying to express this for a while now... A place where I can tell my story. I am 22 years old and on 10.19.2019 I was diagnosed  with stage IV Non-Hodgkins lymphoma that ended up spreading to my liver.  I only noticed it as a bump on my neck in the beginning stages of it, it ended up restricting my breathing quite a bit, ended up getting 3 tissue samples and plenty of cat-scans before they confirmed it to be cancer. (Before covid hit I would go in and sit with cancer children amd their families and just talk for hours getting them whatever they needed, cause I really cared for them  and I always told myself that I would take the burden of getting cancer if it meant a kid didn't.) After weeks of fighting with Medicare to be taken as a client because I could not afford it on my own  I was finally accepted. Fast-forward to September 6th  I  started my first treatment of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is disgusting, pumping your body full of chemicals, killing  off the good portion of your body to dispose of the bad one, you're sitting in the chair, as you can slowly feel yourself get tired, then constant headaches involuntary muscle spasms, Severe nausea, sore throat, a constant feeling of vomiting (I did end up vomiting)  then eventually you're so fatigued after sitting in the chair for 8 hours (Can be longer or shorter based on chemotherapy, Mine was second from the most toxic) that you can barely move. I remember my mom sitting next to me, next to 10 other patients with this same expressionless face.  My chemo was supposed to be once a month for 6 treatments (six months,) but I was fucked over by the government cutting my insurance, making me miss 2 of my treatments which gave the cancer a chance to come back stronger and eventually spread. What was supposed to be 6 treatments turned into 11 due to their mistakes. I thought each treatment would get easier as I got more used to it, but the longer it continued the more hope I lost; out of everyone I knew, I was the most calm and collected so I couldn't afford to crack if that meant everyone else would break down as well.  I watched as my family was put into so much emotional and physical stress and I couldn't do anything except lye in bed for a year and watch.  I was put on many medications; 15 to be exact, just to try and reduce the severity of the side-effects of the chemo but to no avail. fast-forward to  10.19.2020, 11 treatments and a year later, I am now cancer-free with a almost fully functioning immune system. I have seen more people die during my time, half of them being children (7-15) for 50 people. Cancer is a disgusting disease and I wouldn't want to wish it on anyone. I would go through cancer as many times as needed if it meant everyone else wouldn't. I am still glad to be here, thank you so much Tom for bringing this topic into the light, I can not thank you enough.  #FUCKCANCER
Wow Tom ♥️, WOW  10 seconds and and I was hooked.  Ur messages in these songs are amazing. We love you guys 💪♥️
But I've never seen anyone face their death with such bravery and grace. Can only hope I'm as brave when it's my time to go. Good song bro. I think it's very important to bring a spotlight out and point out the fact that it's just a monopoly.  There's no money in the cure. All the money is in the treatment.  But how come the super elite never seem to die from cancer. Because it's 100% curable and they know it. As a matter of fact there was some cat in south America curing people who the doctors in America had already given up on.  Completely cured. Guess what happened.  You already know.  His practice was shut down because his methods weren't  good enough for the standards of modern medicine.  Basically they made up some bullshit to shut him down with. And of course even though he was curing people with all types of cancer,  absolutely no news coverage.  It should have been global news.  My mother,  and countless others have all died because of other people's greed. But someday we will get the truth.  We just have to keep pushing and creating pressure.  These people will pay for what they've done.  In this world or in the next. But I know in my heart these people will fall in the face of the whole world someday.  Maybe sooner than later.  All l know is carma is bitch.  And people do pay for the evil they do unto others. Love your jams Tom. But this one hit close to home. Thank you for the song sir.  From me and all the other people who have lost someone to this horrible disease,  thank you. My mom would have loved it. Sorry so long. Thanks again.
I fucking love you man
To home all have gone from cancer RIP 🌈🙏
If they do have the cure right now they’re using it to probably expirmwnt with human genetics cause that’s what the cancer lies
thank you ❤️
Tom.  Thank You.
Hey Tom idk if you'll see this but I wanted to say thank you. My mom passed from brest cancer when I was 11 and im almost an adult now. Everyday for the last 7 years I've dealt with depression but music keeps me sane, yours especially, it helps a lot. Everyday I pray neither of my sisters get cancer. Love you tom, keep up the good work dude.
If "woke" meant whatever Tom is I wouldn't think being woke was stupid.
I love it man! God bless!
Hey Tom thanks for this song, my *Mom just passed away in Sept after we found out she had stage 4 lung cancer in June of this year after she went in for some pain in her side, after they found the cancer cells in her blood everything went down hill.   Thanks for the music this is the encouragement we need in life.
This hits so hard. :(
Damn dude... haha this is crazy. My father in law was on his death bed with a failing liver. Literally at the hospital in the bed and the call came in a liver was donated. That gave us a few great years with him an hes a stubborn guy won't quit. Now we just found out he has stage  4 cancer an they are going to give him the chemo because it's 50/50 at this point. He is so optimistic about it all,  being so far in debt with his visit an medication just have little bit longer, tough. Now a Few hours ago you drop this track an i feel you, love it, an thanks man.
Thank you for this song, I'm a cancer survivor and had less than 30% chance of survival. Yet I beat the odds, want to know the trick? No trick really, just don't quit. I beat it and if I can... so can others. We're unstoppable juggernauts and immovable objects, we don't move unless we want to, we don't stop unless we want to.
Beat Stage 3 3c grade 3 just to be told that I probably will have a massive heart attack or stroke due to chemo...always fighting
sluffing sprinkler
Your top notch shit, Thanks Crew 💯❤️
Thank for this heartfelt song.  It means a lot to me. I lost my youngest sister to cancer, 3 years ago. She was 46. I also know people who have survived it too. My love and many blessings 💝🙏
Can I leave a thousand thumbs up.
Spot on amazing song!
🤔🥺😢😭🤧🙏💪👍👏
I lost my stepdad to cancer, multiple myeloma, on my birthday in 2018. I just lost my dad July 27th to pancreatic and liver cancer. They both fought hard for years. My dad was a giant. He handled it all with dignity and strength until his last moment. My mom passed a few years before them and I have no one now thanks to cancer. Fucking hate it. Thank you for this song. <3
This is exactly what I felt when my mom passed. Thanks Tom you are an amazing person, I don't care what The Media tries to say you are the best.
Damn.....
I hope tears don’t cause cancer cause if they do I am so fucked. Beautiful track brother. Much respect.
Man you killed this shit💯🔥
Love you Tom🙋
legit tom.
what a powerful song my grandma pass last week from cancer
I agree with your position on this. My Dad passed October 2018. Song brought me to tears. He was by far the strongest man I knew, my whole life. Even with cancer, he was a beast. He worked everyday, he would get radiation and go back to work same day. No bullshit, he was a beast. He was a career Army Infantryman, 75th Ranger w/master jump wings, air assault, SF he did everything. Anytime I tell anyone about him, and tell them everything I always feel like I won't be believed. But I know who he was and how much he inspired me. Compared to him, I'm shit. But I keep him at the front of my mind and keep thinking what would he do. Anyways, it took cancer to take him out. But he fought everyday until he couldn't anymore. I was the last one to help him. He didn't have the strength to get off the toilet, so I helped him up and helped him to bed. He never got back up. But he died surrounded by his family and people he loved. Thank you for your music.
U got an amaizing heart tom keep spreading the positivity my friend
Diagnosed in 2012. Pronounced clear in 2018. This really brought the tears. Thanks for this Tom. God bless all those in the fight. Kick it’s ass.
Can you guys help me get more viewers...
Tom.... Man.... Just heard of you a month ago. Until then rap had lost me as a listener and you've brought me back. Your lyrics are mostly all dope and you keep it real speaking of truth from your heart not sugar coating anything to please anyone. You seem so down to earth dude. This song though hits home hard. We've had so much family with cancer and to many have lost the fight. It's official bro, definitely my new all time favorite artists. So much respect for you Tom.  Thanks for making this. You sir are bada**. 👍👍
The words in this song are amazing. Good stuff pimp 🏆💯
🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My dad is going through this. He's in his second round of chemo and RT. We had to fight with him so much to just keep going and try. It was and is one of the hardest things to go through. Now because if the first round of RT it dissolved his entire casing around his spinal cord and now he has to have testing done to find out if it will make him paralysed from the hips down. CANCER FUCKING SUCKS.
Yo Tom my wife was just diagnosed with stage 2 cervical cancer.... and have had many family members with cancer and this is such a GREAT song THANK YOU!! #HOG
My mom is now cancer fee but 10 years of meds ahead. And a $1 million bill before insurance. The day she got her port removed they found a cyst in my breast. They say it nothing to worry about yet have me return every 6 months. My brother fought leukemia 4x. Died at 32. I missed my chance to say good bye because I was a newly single mom with a job that you weren't aloud to miss any time the 1st 6 weeks. And so many more stories. Sad how many are effected

I watched my aunt take her last breath yesterday, She was fighting a tumor in her brain that was Cancer... She sadly lost that battle but I know she is in a better place now! I made sure to let her know this world didn't deserve her!
Keep it up man, and thank you.
My cousin just passed with leukemia, his mom from lung cancer about 10 years ago 😥
Beautiful had me in tears 🥰
Love you man. You speak the truth and very talented. Keep it up.
Burzynski clinic and antineoplastons.  Everyone should check it out and the documentary about their cancer research.
Straight up fire 🔥 🤘🏻💪🏻 No need for flashy shit, all you need it truth and pen 💯
You have quite a lot of songs that have very strong messages. This song, hands down, best song yet! Hits home for so many people, such an amazing uplifting song...
Great song Tom
Holy smokes! I sit down to listen to some songs and unwind after spending the day with family and dealing with the loss of my Grandmother Doreen passing away this morning after 5 years of cancer. Granny held tight till her last breath. From the Kile's you are loved Granny.
Ok Tom...I’m listening...I hear you, I see you.  This is different, but from you...I see it, I understand, keep it real brother, we all need that right now.
I almost cried! Great song and lyrics Tom, as you said this disease has touched us all!
I lost my mom 6 years ago to cancer Tom. I miss her so much brother. She was my best friend in the whole world.  I could talk to her about anything.  Good times, bad times,  she never gave up on me. She fought it for about 5 years. And then one day she told me she couldn't do it anymore.  She died about 6 weeks after her last kemotherapy treatment.

Thanks
I love the Message Tom. My Grandmother suffered for 10 years with lung Cancer. I wouldn't wish that fate on anyone.  Thank you for helping to spread   awareness. You are an Awesome person!
I say it's what we eat now days.They want cure it cause there is to much money in it.
They definitely do have a cure. But us being sick lines their pockets. If we were healthy they would be broke.
I did read in a rolling stone magazine one time that david lee roth had tongue cancer and cured it in his basement but couldnt tell anyone how he cured it because the government threated him true story.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos ⭕️ Non-Duality
Thank You Jesus for Tom MacDonald. Bro u got me in tears. This kinda hits close to home. My wife has a rare form of lupus. And she is the greatest fighter I know.
these 292 dislikes are probably people who think they are immortal and would never experience cancer. My point is that, at least if you dislike Tom himself, don't disrespect the main topic which is "cancer" Keep it out frame. Enjoy life and stop being hateful. please. support people who need the support. basically, support everyone.
This is why people love your shit bro, you talk about real shit that real people go through, not just bitches and money and hoes and drugs and being a fucking idiot. Shits real man, don't stop what your doing, we all appreciate it.
God damn he looks stupid. Face tatts whst a great idea
Government had a cure for cancer for years but won't release it why, it's make moneys millions every year, got to be part of the elite to have the cure
Tom's hooks still suck booty juice but this is a great song with a good message.
I got diagnosed with bladder cancer in January im really really lucky because it was caught early. Iv lost to many friends and family to cancer. Good luck to all that are fighting this horrible disease
This song is for my ex step mom. She's going through stage 4 breast cancer
Shit's crazy!! I mean what are the odds? My mother died of cancer, and today just happens to be her Birthday. #Craziness
Another amazing song it is sooooo fire
to whoever is fighting right now be strong. As someone who was fortunate enough to survive thru it this brought tears to my eyes Tom. I hope whoever you had in mind when you wrote this pulls through brother.
Awesome song, and great message.
Thank you Tom, love the song. My Mom is going through radiation right now for breast cancer, chemotherapy almost killed her, but my Mom is a fighter. This song will touch a lot of people.
Thank You Tom, You put Your heart and soul into Your music. This song is a gift to everyone suffering to have strength to fight another day. You are an inspiration, someone who motivates from all the hate. The World is blessed to have You in it.
I though “pff.. i wont cry.. i am not a btch”... guess what.. i fcking did it, shit men T_T
You know alot of your songs are very hit and miss, others are just shock value for viewership to "push the envelope" BUT this particular song i will give credit where its do and kudos. It has a good message and a strong empowerment to those who are fighting cancer and may be losing hope. This is what today's world needs more of. Well done tom.
Thank for doing this song. I lost lot of family and friends from cancer.

Lost my dad to cancer it was horrible to see a strong man crumble and decay over 2 months and not even be able to move or know who he was FUC.... Cancer
😥♥
As a woman fighting breast cancer right now Tom, I thank you for this song.  Shared :)
This song made me decide to stop smoking.
It's amazing how you have a gift to make music you KNOW will reach people in need. Your giving such a confident theme song for ones who need. Love it!
God bless you
Number 9 on trending!!!!
Thank you for Doing this Tom Macdonald
Good work Tom, good work.
You damn straight about them having the cure for that and many other things but why would they do that when it’s a cash cow and the cure puts an end to most of the profits. They don’t care about people they care about money. Feel sorry for anyone that gets cancer and I hope they can fight it and beat it and live a long and healthy life after the battle.
I love ur music bin listening for awhile now. Truly inspirational ❤
Shit.... Brilliant
Shut the hell up, tom. I hate uninformed morons speaking on things they dont understamd. I didnt think a song could be this ill conceived and informed.
Nice music, thanks)
Bawling my eyes out. Beautiful and so true Tom. My aunty Barbara passed away April 10th 2019 from her 2nd battle broke her hip valentines day and never managed to recover cancer took over and I know there's a cure some needs to fucking stop being greedy and save our loved ones
I'm getting really blink 182 vibes from.the chorus
True man ! Nice song I am your biggest fan you are awesome! 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Lost my dad to cancer. He died within a few weeks of the time the dr said he would. Even with all the treatments. I agree cancer is a money grab.
It's almost like he just learned how to read a research things and haven't seen this s*** going on for 20 years wants to tell people like we don't already no rap about something that's relevant that make sense
You were right. Got me teary eyed. I despise seeing bad things happen to children. The song is very inspirational.   Keep it up!! The sky is the limit brother!!
My wife lost her mother a little over a year ago to ovarian cancer. Her doctor, turns out, was a pediatrician. She could have survived this, but the system doesn't care.
It took my dad on Wednesday . RIP Scoot 💓
This is a great song but very dark video. I could deal with it happening to me, but my kids... that would crush me
So deep! Known too many that’s battled the beast called cancer, Some won and some lost. So sad that all people care about is greed!
My sister just beat leukemia 5 years ago this hits deep
First you say we don't know where we're going to go then you say either heaven or hell dude just rap about things that make sense stop sounding like an idiot
Damn tom. I like lots of your music. I appreciate your need to point out the obvious which seems to most not so obvious. This song is by far one of my favorite songs sense before I even knew your name. You always hit your mark but this one should do more than that. Multi trillions of dollars and nothing to show for it. I dont know a soul who doesn't know some with or has passed from cancer. Enough is enough. Keep up the good work
Bravo to you Tom MacDonald 👏
Everyone's a fighter but at the end of the day we knew that's a long time ago but my question to you is why do you rap music with people who make fun of indigenous people the question to you Tom very racist you and Madchild in your dumb song called drugs you are the cancer bud
I go to the doctor on the 22nd to find out what my xray shows is jaw cancer or not. I'm undecided on whether or not I will recieve  treatment.
Stage 3 & 4, triple simultaneous Cancers in 1997 been a caregiver in the cannabis industry for the last 14 years, 1 of 100k men on record to have testicular and male breast cancer same time.  Cant understand unless you been there. Thanks for the acknowledgment You 2 are always amazing
Wow, if only we could get the Politicians and The CEOs to listen to your words and do something about it. Instead of lining those pockets of theirs. Love ya Brother.
😭🥰😇🤗🥳
I love you Tom. Thanks. I lost family to that sickness
I cried through this whole song and I love it because stomach cancer runs on my dads side and it skips every other generation and I’m that generation and I already have problems like Gerd and I had surgery when I was born on my stomach
(Obviously this is a joke, before anyone loses their shit over my comment)  But, would you trust a doctor with those eyebrows though?
Lost my Dad to this ish. Thank you for bringing attention 🙏🏼💯
Truly amazing tom ,thank you my mother and grandmother are dieing from cancer ,I have mad respect for you and your music helps me more then you will ever know!!!!! Ty BROTHER
Who tf disliked this?
Like always Tom thinking of everyone biggest heart out of any rap artist out there keep it up brother
I lost both parents; dad to cancer and mom to addiction. I absolutely hate how people are used to ensure some can have more.
Glad to be from the UK and not have to worry about the financial impact of illnesses like cancer
What a great song and message. 👍. FUCK CANCER. Prayers to all family and ppl going through this.
Dude.. this one got to me. My mom passed last month from this shit. Great song. Thank you for this.
Damn brother this is great. Thanks for the positive message you continue to spread.
I lost my little cousin this year just a few days before his 22nd birthday to cancer. It was his 3rd relapse of leukemia. He fought it since he was 11. He requested that his body be donated to science so other kids might survive. So that's what was done. He died this summer in St Louis, while outside the hospital in the streets people were fighting over skin color and other stupid things. If all this energy was focused on finding a cure for cancer no one would be dying from it anymore.
So much truth. Keep standing against the elite and spreading truth.    I know you may not be a believer in CHRIST JESUS but may you be blessed and given strength to continue the fight against the darkness
❤❤❤
As a Stage 4 Cancer survivor for 2 years now I’m very Thankful to my Lord and Savior. I know it’s inevitable that the chances are great of it coming back but I’m Hopeful.Hopeful i can meet Tom and a few others on my bucket list before that day ever comes at Least. Much Respect Tom!
All I can say this is a very moving song. Thanks TOM......   267 Hater/trolls....
As someone who has bone cancer and isn't having one of my best days I came across this song and it makes me feel better and I thank you , music soothes the soul and right now my soul can use all the help it can get keep the great talent coming
Woah.... powerful stuff
Haters aren’t listening or they don’t have hearts
Been a fan since you were just on facebook trying to get out there. You and your girl are absolutely amazing and so important to making the world woke and a better place. Thank you for breaking the boundaries nobody else will!
Facts
You are awesome keep it up I love youre music and how you speak the truth with no fucks given
Respect to this one bro👑
My Dad officially became cancer free last week. He battled lung cancer and a brain tumor for over 2 years that left his right arm permanently paralyzed. Thank you for this Tom, much love and Respect!
Why is Tom writing a song about his discography? 🤔
Beautiful song bro...
The ones who gave it a thumb down don't have hearts this song made me think of my ex
Opsite of a negative satanic industry . beautiful.
I just want to say ty an keep up the had work you do for your fans. Im sorry but out of all the videos he has done this is the best one of them all , Tom this hit home with me an my wife  .
I just lost my dad in July to lung cancer 😞
Tom mcdonald...your amazing!!!!!!
F cancer
My mother and I have had this convo about they have to have a cure but can’t come out because it would put to many people out of jobs. It’s so messed up
Those lyrics,  The gentle and honest personality,  You still have morals, standards, empathy, thats not all that usual these days. And lets not forget..  lots of talent and passion!! And that shows, very clearly, through your words, songs, music, video's..   You and your l❤ve make beautiful music/video's, Also, I'm so glad your dog is still by your side to see you both shine, and get lots of love hugs and kisses from you guys.   Keep it up, you make a lot of peoples days a bit more beautiful, happy, or better in any other way with your music!  Best wishes, love, Chantal en Liam from the netherlands 🇳🇱   👩‍👦🐕
The doctors said the only treatment they could give me for my glioma (brain tumour) was an MRI every two years (with radioactive contrast). I said "Okay, I exercise my right to refuse treatment". They did offer me radiotherapy once. Apparently asking for a classical music station to go with it isn't how it works.
Love the song. My 6 yr old daughter is going through treatment right now for leukemia. She will get to ring the bell next March.
The most woke rapper ever
Joe Biden is a cancer!  Maga!
Buddy just lost his wife to cancer. Really hits home.  Pray God gives him some sort of peace
Great song man!!
Its my first time commenting on his song but I must say he is the only rapper that says the best truth ....   Let's do our best to protect him whilst he is alive 😪😪😪   Am Godwin ... Wanna be my friend???. Chat me up on  +233557116734
Everyone who's falling for this Plandemic is worried about the cure for Covid, but where has the cure to cancer been all this time??
12 extended family members to cancer in the last 6 years. Did two eulogies for a friend last year who lost first his grandma then his dad to cancer. Yeah. Screw cancer.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Daughter was diagnosed at one.  She is now a junior in college those years of treatment and hospitals were a nightmare.  Thanks for the song.  Keep doing what you are doing.
Must have hit a nerve. This is the first time I had to go searching for one of your Friday vids.
🧀
Wow! Awesome song dude, so so moving 💔 Keep up your amazing work and don't forget YOU'RE AWESOME!!!
Incredible song 🙏🏻
269 people need better taste in music
🙏👑✝️
You are a true godsend, a vessel of truth to the industry and this world. Every song is a movement. Thank you sir for your contribution to music!!!
This song almost made me cry, just recently lost my father to cancer, and today was his birthday, thanks Tom!
Just fucking busted out in tears and I couldn't tell you why.
😞💔😭💔😭💔😭💔...that is all
How could anyone hate this song?
He is the only rapper that I have seen in a music video that fully pronounces all of the lyrics with true emotion he puts life into HIS music ✌
My ❤ goes to the people choosing over medical bills or a house! I'm blessed to be where I am but those out there my heart bleeds for you an the pain you go through! Your not alone!
Strong words big time!!!!
You always say it like is . Never stop
My mom passed away from cancer when I was 15. Everytime I think of it I wish it were me because that way my little brother would've had a mother growing up.
it's still corny and its shit even if the message is good
About 7 years ago I was diagnosed with leukemia and it took a rough toll n my family not only emotionally but financially we were living in a trailer at the time and my dad was working at a factory my mom couldn't work cause she had to take car of me and we only had one car which my dad had to use to work and pay for rent and all the bills for my treatment luckily my moms side of the family saved enough money and bought us a car so my dad didn't have to miss work to take me to my appointments my sister wasnt alluded to stay so she had to live with my grandparents and I didnt see had for a while when I was finally aloud to start more of a normal life when  I was in 2nd grade and about a year after that we bought a house and a good car and now my dad has a good job and we are doing well its been a while since I've really thought of that for the longest I've tried to block it out but I've come to exept I'm 14 now and this song really hit hard but I like it and its so   Thank you so much for this song  Sincerely Caden Goodrich
My uncles fighting lung cancer it’s good news for now but that can change
This song is deep we all someone who has gone through this
100 % true they got a cure , but womt give it to the public , lie to us all the time . So,sick of this governments around the world . Oh a pandemic covid , people struggling for money , what does the uk government do give them selfs a nice PAY RISE  how sick is that . Imstop now so angry
Sorry about my spelling lol im still deal n with brain fog.
Death comes to us all my friend.  It hurts when it does and you made me cry.  Great video.  God Bless you...we are eternal though.  I know I am going to see my loved ones again...they are better off there than I am here.  I actually know you need to stay here for a long time.  You are doing good work and you are on a voyage of discovery.
Fuck man. I've known 4 people who had cancer and watched it kill them. I'm only 22 and this really hit me. I miss them.
Heck I just lost my dog to cancer! I was told he had few months to live I said in my head no way! But 2 months later it got him!
One Day At A Time ☯️

Most of the family I've lost has been to cancer.
Tom Macdonald thank you. I lost my aunt to Cancer and it rocked my world. I love your music and please keep doing what u do
Trying to change the world one song at a time.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4166407/      Last year I found out about a drug used in Australia that has been famously in known as an inexpensive cure for cancer and other diseases and parasites.   I read that the United states was avoiding use of the drug due to fear of financial interest losses.  I also read that they might now consider reevaluating the inexpensive drug. P.s. I am not a doctor
Omg he wasn't kidding when he warned us all that we were gonna cry. 😭
My best friend died from cancer at the age of 21😔😔😔😔 Thanks for this song Tom It really touch my soul
truely inspirational
Dude.   Tears

0:47 So we do not know what will happen after our death ! and we can't know... so at least, we die as better believers for us ^^ by the way, all metaphysical questions have an answer in Islam. I wish a speedy recovery, health and wellness for every patient.
It hits home...Lost my elder brother to colon cancer on 13th May this year. It was the hardest day of my life. Thanks Tom
Out of me my sisters if cancer hits any of us i hope and pray its me not any of them, my mums already in remission, this just shows how much money won't change a thing, just stick to your roots and stay loving your family especially mom and dad sisters and brothers.
You are true inspiration walking !!! Thank you my friend and possibly brother .
Big thank you for spreading these messages out man, you are the king for this.. I spoke about this in one of my songs so u can imagine how happy i am that I am not alone :)
Niclosamide
loved this song man so true! gave me chills man keep up the good work !
I fux with you MACCY MAC...THIS IS DIFFERENT BUT TRUE REAL SHIT HES SPITTING ..Finally a change in music yo!! Much respect!!  -drozski rox
The amount of passion in your eyes with every single word just made me bawl like a baby.
Cancer ate away my Grandma from the inside out. She died at just 60 pounds. I guarantee there is a cure. She should have been there for my wedding and for her grandkids. There's no money to be made in cures. There's big money in treatment. Who's not going to spend every penny to live?
Bro this message is so strong man. This shit hits home. So glad your around to spread awareness for these issues we all face.
Great song man I lost my mum and dad to this nightmare mum 11 years ago dad 6 years ago hurts every day

Thx tom
Executive salaries are relatively high when compared to similar organizations, with the president and CEO of the American Cancer Society earning $1.4 million per year. I have a true story...a secret that haunts me. They for a fact have had a cure. I saw it work when I was a kid. I was sworn never to tell because the scientist who used the (I'm calling it paste) stuff on someone who had cancer. They became very sick after taking the paste internal and external on cancer (melanoma). Yet,  when the person a few months later went to the cancer doctor, (not the scientist) there was 0 trace of cancer. My mom saved the paste and but it in her safe. They story behind the scientist was he had to hide with his daughter because he & others worked for the Government and developed the cure...the others were picked off one by one...I don't know if they ever caught up with him because I was too young to really understand.
This needs to be an anthem ! Damn ... Incredible!!
Tom you are an amazing artist that never sugar coats anything and isn't afraid to speak the truth. Well done Tom. People need to hear the truth.
Beautiful
Damn Tom......  hard hitting truth right here..every word was fire. Thanks
Omg I totally balled my eyes out watching this😭😭😭😭😭😭my husband lost his mum few wks ago to cancer😢😢🥺🥺Amazing song🥰🥰
Just know you gotta starve cancer it's a Vitamin B-17 Defitioncy
thank you so much for this song, finally someone that does it justice!!!!
Wow!!! That hit home in so many ways. Good job Tom and thank you!
You have a wonderful evening
The best rapper alive , talking about real issues and not bullshit or trying to flex shit for ego
All I can say is Wow I can relate to this song so much you don't even know, Thank you Tom
Tom MacDonald, I am going to do what part I can to make sure everyone knows your name.  You are talent and what the world needs right now.  Huge fan!
🤙🤙
This is what I really needed to hear! 12 years ago I got Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma and ended up being MRSA which paralyzed me and went through hell but I survived. Then on Dec Of 19 the devil showed its head again this time almost killing me 3 times in a month and found out I have colon cancer and full this day I have not been able to stay treatments yet. I have been getting so down cause I was put in a nursing home and haven't been able to see family and friends for almost a year. BUT this song has given me hope and I will NEVER give up!! To all others that do have it and going through the same shit I'm paying for u!! CANCER SUCKS!!
Great song
GMOs, flouride in our water to make us complacent and stupid, common core to destroy our ability to employ divergent thought. The government is not looking out for Americans they're looking out for their own financial gain... Period.  Wake up... Cancer hasn't been cured because it's a multi billion dollar a year industry.
Wow
Hey Tom thank you so much  for this song it really meana alot to me and im sure many others o just went through 7 weeks of khemo and radiation  i had  stage 4 tonsil and lmipnods  cancer. This song means alot to  me. Love your work and thank you for allways just be n you. That true is the best part you..  PS. I use to listen to your .usic during my khemo treatment.  Thanks again you r a true artist.  PEACE ✌  ,
This song is very touching my mom passed away with cancer I love this song you did a great job Tom
I like Tom and I like the music, but I'm conflicted by the message a bit if I'm being honest.
Fucking love you Tom..
Wish sing this 2 months ago😔
Yay I wanted to hear this
Fuck yes, bro. The world needed this ❤️
"INDONESIA" TUHAN MEMBERKATIMU TOM
Love it great job 👏 👍 🥰
Tom and Nova i absolutely Love  and  Adore you two!!!  All i can say is Fuck Cancer its has taken loved ones away from me and left me broken hearted  but I still have huge mad love for everything else good in this world.
My boy is a Fuckin Legend
Thank you Tom and Nova🇨🇦💯❤️🤜🏻
Incredible and touching as always man
There you go Tom. Now you know where your going. No more “I’m corny”.keep doin stuff like this. This kind of music is bigger than you or anyone’s opinion. Shit like this needs to be heard. Great job dog mad love from Albany ny
Wow! Wish I could have played this for my mom before she passed from stage 4 long cancer! Love your music! ❤
In tears right now! My son was diagnosed at 5 years old with Neuroblastoma and fought it for 4 years. Hardest part of our lives. We just celebrated his 16th birthday and he’s doing amazing. The things he experienced that no one will ever know and the friends he lost to this horrible beast, unexplainable. Thank you for sharing this! Absolutely beautiful! 🙏
Go from shit talker to suicide songs to idgaf songs to rock and rap... now a song that hits home at most people, including myself. Man you are a great artist. Hopefully this year I will be able to buy those albums and support you. For now though I hope the like and shares help you do bigger and better things. ✌
Who actually dislikes this? You hate on tom so much that you dislike a message that's meant to help anyone, a fan of his or not. I guess cancer is more than a tumor that grows in our body. It's the people around us too
Amazing 💕
Speechless!!!! This z priceless!!!! Love Tom
Lost many loved ones to it, love this song!
thankyou this is amazing
Bro this is powerful and touches my heart I you tom u do not care and you are not scared to speak your mind and this song is nothing but FACTS and I like how you dont follow the rappers that talk and convince people to do drugs you are and all of you fans love u that. GOOD BLESS YOU TOM.
Making me cry and shit
That was good TOM
Ahhhh man 🥺🖤
Amazing. I am still trying to stop the tears, I lost so many important loved ones to this killer.  Thank you Tom.  Nova too!  🖤💀🖤
Damn good track!
Thank you for this video. More people need to have there days brightened.
This hits hard my mom died from breast cancer a few months back it brought tears to my eyes Tom always tells the truth thank you for writing this
This guy is on another level! This is how the rap game should be! Talking about actual issues, making music for the people who need it, calling people out with facts. Every one of his songs talks to you deep. He is definitely in it for the right reasons not the money. KEEP IT UP TOM! WERE HERE WITH YOU
This means alot to me Tom. I lost my Grandfather, Aunt who raised me and her daughter/my cousin. Thanks for bringing awareness and hope.
Yo bro shout out to Tom man he did something that will help a ton of people and he is spitting straight facts
Tom, I am writing this through tears. I have felt the messages in each one of your songs, but this one hits me hard. I lost my dad to bone cancer during the COVID lock down May 13th in Florida.  The state swooped in, while my brother and I were on mandatory quarantine for two weeks, and stole my mother with an emergency guardian court case because she suffers from mild senile dementia. We lost our father our inheritance and our mother all at once. We are now fighting the state of Florida for custody. In the mean time they have liquidated all of Mom's assets for pennies on the dollar and forced her into a nursing home.No visitors, stuck in her room wearing a mask. My poor mom is the victim in all this.. She lost her best friend of 49yrs, her family, her dog and all she loves. When life kicks ya in the teeth, it kicks hard.
Time is not only your friend but is also your enemy. Love and cherish the time you have and spend. It is the most VALUABLE community a person can have.
Spot on Tom!! I spoke on this topic 4 years ago, big ups man!!!

I'm not crying, you are! Damn this song hits on a different level.
Tom man, I needed this song today! Thank you man
this song brought tears to my eyes I personally known people close to me who have passed away from cancer even at a young age. I hate it and its been 4 years and i'm still not over it
i cried and proud some one had to say it.... @#anonymous     ,333
Excellent song love it.  Just found out February of 2020 my dad lung cancer. He had a lung completely removed and had to get kemo can't even tell hes the same person he is 52 but looks like he is 90
i can see the message behind the song and i can see why he done it but he could've made it sound better because then it'd more catchy meaning more people should eventually hear the song spreading even more awareness around the world
Another great video by nova and song by tom.
This song is heart wrenching for me. I’ve lost a few family members to this disease. The words are beautiful. Thanks for this video. ❤️
bra faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaax
Another amazing Awesome song. Oh and where do we go when we die nowhere we're just dead. LOL yeah you could like live the healthiest way and  you still get cancer he is right everything is carcinogenic you can do the cleanest eating and live the holier-than-thou lifestyle. And when he mentioned something about cigarettes and alcohol. To be honest with you humans are just chasing the next dopamine hit... whether it be cigarettes alcohol drugs sex p*r* buying the next new toy addiction to spending
Damn this hurt so bad. Thank you for this song
The cure for cancer is in nature
Yup...okay, that hit me right in my heart bone. My mom is a breast cancer survivor. She's also the strongest person on Earth because I say so. I drop my tears for anyone and everyone who has fought this battle or had to fight it with a loved one. Thanks for touching the feels. Be safe, be good, be you.
Bro u just went deeper than any "contious rapper"  has ever went.. I think... seriously. Thank u for the love brother. People need that so much more than they need money, cars, and clothes. Thank u for who u are
4 time cancer survivor here.  Stage IIIc Intransit Melanoma.  6 surgeries, 2 rounds of chemotherapy, one round was a year long.  I've been in remission for 8 1/2 years now.  Thank you for this great song Tom.  It really means alot.
When you create hope & strength in a song & rise above.......... LEGENDARY.
hooks are always cringey tbh
real talk
I wasn't ready lol. ...  I have had autoimmune illnessess diagnosed since Navy in 91.  I have received a lot of new " labels" in those years. One last year was " an acceptable amount of cancer cells" that we now must monitor. So every four months I must endure the anxiety of blood work that might show that doomed unacceptable level. I was told with humor that if cancer was money I had like 30cents out of a dollar.   Anyway these lyrics can't be more true. I REFUSE TO STOP FIGHTING ALL OF IT!!! I will always hang onto the hope that all of it will have cure. We ARE WARRIOR STRONG!  and you don't know faith until that's what you cling to. I have rituxan infusion for rheumatoid arthritis sjogrens dercums fibromyalgia and co-morbidities. I go every four months for eight hours then two weeks later for eight hours. I've learned to steady myself but I still have guilt. I may need infusions for many many many years ( I can hope) but I've already come to realize that my guilt for that isn't going away. Because some beautiful souls have been lost in the two and half years I've been going. I send my love out to All of you. Each day we have here is a good one even if it didn't happen the way we wanted. Take care of each other! #HANGOVERGANG #NOVAROCKAFELLER #TOMMACDONALD
if there's something deeper than feels, bro you just hit it
My mom was just given till the end of the month to live. Good bless you bro.
Bro why TF would people dislike this,  I get it if u don't like the song u do u, but it's about cancer why would u dislike
Great song Thomas McDonald. Thank you.
This hits so deep. I love it so much that is connecting with world around and speaking up on the real problems in the world.
This song hit me like a truck, my dad died of cancer in 2016 and I still haven't gotten past it. Thanks. Love you tom
This is like... wow. You are such a talented man, Tom.
I had cancer a year ago at the age of 33. Great video man. There are so many people who can use this message. Much love man 💙
Wow just thank you.
No hair, or hair, that beautiful GORGEOUS  one, was still thinking, and that's what it takes, history. U are no child anymore. But there are hundreds of millions going through what u already know...
I lost my mom in 2007 to cancer, I love this guy!! He speaks nothing but facts and truth!!!
Nah bro, understand gene mutations, they are all different.
Truth...
I just lost my dad today to stage four lung cancer!! I'm so ghost right now!! I don't know what to feel at the moment!!but please continue your legacy your music don't let anyone stop you for being who you are! I would be able to cope with out you brother!!! Thank you for everything!
PLEASE READ IN FULL. I'm always greatful to see so much hope from Tom in every video he makes, but since he has so many eyes and, as far as I know, professes to be a Christian, I need to do as he does and be honest about the beliefs of Jesus' teachings. As a person on this earth I can respect that the reality of loss and death is never easy to deal with emotionally and socially, especially since it has, to some degree, been commercialised. As a fellow Christian, however, I know that the wages of sin ARE death, this world is not our true home regardless and it is always better to be spiritually minded than physically minded. All of this is already proven in His word and we must not turn from it. Also, I found someone who put this interesting link  https://youtu.be/X-jRLBrwVf8   in their comment. It's about a Swedish health company called, "H.A.M.L.E.T.", as I understand it, and apparently they have achieved a 99.8% success rate with curing people who have cancer from a survey of 1,000 people, but they can't get past "Big Pharma" to get enough funding for some reason. It's worth looking into I'd say.
Such a beautiful, inspirational song about such an ugly sickness.  Thank you Tom for being brave enough to make this.  Lost my Aunt when she was 47.  😪   #HOG #CancerSucks #HateCancer
OKAY Tom you dont need to make me cry right now.... I love your music and you are the best no matter what people say. this song is just some of the many  you make showing how much you care! all the facts you spit is just amazing. I have now downloaded this song keep it up #HOG
Pretty good but I know where I'm going when I die, maybe you should read the Bible. I do love your music
I have a brother who survived cancer and a brain tumour I happy he made it through
*Tears* nothing but tears bro Thank you for this, not just for me but everyone else touched by cancer
Hell yea Tom thank you for this.
This song is phenomenal, what is extra touching is the comments. Love to everyone. 🧡🤍🖤 This is what we needed. Thank you Tom
Who else is crying
I'm glad i found you!
It's a money racket.. too lucrative to cure. Why hasn't anyone investigated those raking in money for research for corruption?  Seems most of my family has died from cancer. Every year they want more money.. the treatment is highway robbery and inhumane.
Cry thinking about my mother in law uncle and grandpas ,,,thank you Tom even though I cried
I love the person and artist you have become keep it real Tom. Been fan a very long time and i know you got more and it will be good love you bro .. keep on keepin on !!! 🤘🤘🤘
Rip my late wife... Thank you Tom... <3 keep doing it brother! Bless!

Thank you so much!!!!
♨️❤♨️❤💯
I posted this to my Facebook.  I received a message saying a friend of mine lost a cousin yesterday to cancer.  She thanked me for posting.  So I’m thanking you good sir.  Thank you for you words and your time.
TOM! Look up Royal Rife... man was a genius, and cured cancer a long time ago. Of course his findings were discredited and said to be false. But he took 100 terminal patients and cured their cancer.
Damn!!! Your lyrics are amazing. Hands down one of my favorite artists! Tom keep up your honest lyrics. This one hit home!!!!!
They make more money treating it than curing it.
This is amazing. I can only hope that those who are affected by this horrible disease hear this and know they have the strength to kick cancers ass!! Thank You.   😪😭🥰😇❤💙💜
awsome track bro
W0w tom macdonald what a wonderful song.
Definitely a strong message
Damn
My god this song is powerful. I cried remembering watching my mom suffer from this. Powerful 😥
This is beautiful! I personally went through a battle with cancer last year T-cell Lymphoblastic lymphoma. It was by far the hardest thing I've ever had to go through mostly because my wife and I just had our first baby 3 months before finding out I had cancer. For me the worst part was not being able to work and provide for my family. But thankfully I am in remission now and I'm finally able to work! Honestly if it wasn't for my family, friends, god and my sense of humor I don't know if I would be here today!
Stage 4 tongue cancer warrior here brother, thank you 👊
Wow .. amazing well written and well delivered.. Great video too. 3 minutes of goosebumps
6 time cancer survivor right here and this is my foundation channel   thanks tom ! great track ! would love to send you fuck cancer merch
As a cancer survivor it warms my heart to see this. This will definitely bring alot of smiles and help alot of people who need it with everything there going through, thank you Tom!
I lost my mother at the Age of 7
This is why I love Tom, he speaks about real issues. It's an honor to know you exist and that my brother and I got to meet you. Love the music <3
I can not remember the last time a song has brought me to tears
Death is not the end have faith
My mum died of cancer when I was 18. This really touched me man. Thank you for putting this out. 😞
My mother died to cancer on the 13th of October last year it would have been here birthday today.
Thanks Dupont..... thanks US GOV for all of it .. the Genetically engineered wheat, the fructose syrup.... The pigs, cows, chickens filled w/ steroids, antibiotics.... Thanks for killing the people i love .... Thanks for leaving me helpless while i watch them go through hell & leave this world one by one. Tom MacDonald is an Artist ... singing on the REAL
For a year I had a mystery illness. Fatigue , burning skin, horrible neurological symptoms (anxiety , Panic, depression, racing thoughts, you name it)  went to tons of doctors and had tons of test. Researched everyday for a year and ordered a $100 hair test to find out I had heavy metal toxicity. Been treating myself and all my symptoms are disappearing.
Tom is the antidote to the 2020 mentality! Keep it up big dog we are all proud and have the upmost love and respect for YOU!!
Thought he was gonna shave his head
Thank you for this to many people in my family has been touched by this already thank so much ❤❤❤❤
Bro that was amazing I felt every word and got me crying

Thank you
Beautiful
This is absolutely beautiful
This hit me hard.. my mom died in may due to cancer.. 💔
Bro ✌💛👏
I’m not crying you’re crying!
I needed this song though. I’ve watched so many family members battle cancer including my brother and I’m currently going through test after test because they think I have it. You’re so right it is an industry they can’t afford to lose. This song brought me to tears.
Seeing my Auntie for last time tomorrow. 😩 Cancer.  My auntie gave her life to Christ last week. Still, she is crying. We all are. Tom, there is something after this.
Ur so full of bs. Make this clip just for likes
fire
there is no one cure for all cancers. because of what cancer is, damage to a certain part of the dna inside cells that causes them to grow uncontrollably, some things that work for one patient don't always work for other patients with the exact same type of cancer. cancer isn't a virus or a bacteria it is your cells multiplying uncontrollably creating masses of flesh inside you called tumors, if the tumors keep growing they strangle the other organs they are growing through and or around. the point of cancer treatments is to shrink tumors. either to the point of eradication or to where they are small enough so that they can be removed surgically. our immune systems actually are able to stop a lot of non aggressive types of cancers, but not all cancers are easily stoppable, the ones that make it past our immune systems are what we have spent a century and billions of dollars developing treatments and surgical procedures for.  even if there were a cure all for cancer that doesn't mean that cancer would be eradicated, millions of people would still get cancer and require the cure. as mentioned above it isn't a virus or bacteria that can be wiped out like small pox. as long as there is dna that can be damaged there will always be cancer.  my sincere condolences to all those who have lost loved ones to this illness.
Life changing lyrics!.
There is no cure for cancer when it is being intentionally caused with radiation from radars(weather, military, cell towers.. etc.) and also radiation from household items and things found around out homes such as smart meters, wifi routers, and microwaves.. we are literally being bathed in radiation on a daily basis which is accumulative. There are chemicals in everything we touch in our daily lives such as the artificial ingredients foods we eat every day, medicines containing cancer causing ingredients which are prescribed and given to the masses.. there are many things that case cancer and we even as individuals are exposed to multiple of these a day. It's a wonder how any of us are even alive.
Dang you dope bro! You talk about real stuff other than these fakes out there and you expose the bullshit out there. Great job!
I wish cancer had a face. I’d ask it to step in the ring with Mike Tyson. It took my mom and father in law at a young age. To everyone out there, my heart bleeds for you.
I Love what you speak man ! There isn't a song you put out that I dont like ..always looking forward to your new songs
When cancer became the new Aids thats when Aids became treatable an beatable smh. If anyone is fighting cancer please look into bitter apricot kernels and also drinking huge amounts of carrot juice. Stop eating carbohydrates and sugar guys. Look at the food pyramid and flip it up side down. Thats how you want eat as far as the pyramid go. Cancer loves sugar guys dont eat any sugar. Fuck the fast food. That is refined carbohydrates in the end its sugar. kernels are very controversial so do alot of research im not saying these are cures.. i just wanna arm you and give you starting points so you can look all this up and start your own path to learning about Cancer.. Thc, cbd and cbg oil are also great things. Drink water high in PH. cancer loves an acidic host..  an acidic host is breeding grounds for disease. You wanna turn your body into more alkaline. Last but not least look into Dr. Sebi. I lost my mom to cancer and it fucked me up. My mom was my road dog, my best friend, my everything. Im still recovering from her loss. After she passed I wanted to study cancer and know everything about it and try to help ppl if I could. Now I'm not saying any of this I mentioned is a cure. I am not a doctor I am just a regular guy who has done alot of studying. What I can say is everything I've mentioned shows promise at least thats what I've read. Tom hats off to you brother. This was a great song and you were right I cried. I lost it when girl buzzed her hair. Im the one that buzzed my moms. I hope this helps someone or sparks something in someone to do research and spread the word and help someone else
I lost my Mama to cancer Xmas 2016. Gone sober for October to help raise money for Macmillan cancer charity.
Beautiful song about a terrifying reality. Keep this up Tom. You're an inspiration and a motivation for all of us. How is it that only you can make me bob my head to the beat with tears running down my face? Fire bro! 🔥🔥🔥
I lost my mom to cancer, she fought till the bitter end she was the strongest person I know, thank you Tom this song resonates with heart
Awesome bro very touching  I love it
Thank you ..
Tom MacDonald is a new age saint. When something is real.....I mean REAL, not just really sad, you can tell. He seems like he truly cares, and we need more of that. Don't give up, I know you're strong, show them your fire.
ERW water man. We are water and cancer feeds off acidic environments. As you said our environments toxic so is the water we drink that we need to live. Easiest way to make someone sick is to pollute the very substance they need to survive.
❤️
PLEASE READ.  I'M BEGGING YOU.  I have tried for 4 years to try and get anyone to listen.  Lund University in Sweden discovered the cure for 40 different cancers, including the hardest to beat cancers 4 years ago.  They recently did a 1,000 person trial on persons with bladder cancer, and achieved a 99.8% success ratio.  Now they are out of money again.  So they cannot do the next trial. They have held lectures to raise money, and all the pharma companies just walk away.  It is called H.A.M.L.E.T. ""Human alpha-oleic made lethal to cancer".  I am tired of fighting for it.  I even contacted a few cancer hospital administrators and was just pushed away.  I promise if you really research it, you will be amazed.  Another reason it has not gotten the notice it deserves, is because all the YouTube videos on it are in English with an extremely thick Swedish accent, making them impossible to follow.  It started out with just 2 professors who made the discovery.  3 years later, an investor came in and created a company called Hamlet Pharma, but they are small.  It is taking them forever.  They still need a lot of money, but more importantly, ATTENTION.  I discussed the findings on FB w/ authors of cancer treatment books, and they never bothered to research it.  They just assumed it was another false cure.  But it is as real as it gets.  Every cancer death we have today is a needless death, because people will simply not take notice.  Here's the link:  Maybe you can take the fight from here.  This program needs a tireless fighter.  I've pushed for years and just can't push anymore.  I would highly suggest finding someone who can speak Swedish to make the translation easier, and even fly to Sweden to meet with Catharina Svanborg personally.  Good luck....   THIS IS THE CURE FOR CANCER:   It's sad this brilliant professor has to travel from place to place trying to ask for money to get it off the ground.    . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jRLBrwVf8
Lost my mum 4yrs ago the 26th of this month to cervical cancer thank you for this song Tom
Name me 1 other guy talking about this shit rn, who says what he says bcuz he speaks what he feels? Tom and of course Nova...why y'all gotta keep giving me feels too?
I lost my mom 8 years ago from cancer.
Thank you Tom, you are amazing!
What makes you so different, you base your talent on truth. We appreciate it!
When I was born I had a bunch of issues with how I was using my hands and how I was holding my head, my mom took me to 25 different specialist they all said nothing was wrong. When I was 21 months old I was diagnosed with a cancer called pilocytic astrocytoma and allot of the sergons didn't except my case because they thought I was just gonna die anyway. I only had 10% chance to survive and the doctor said if I did I would be paralyzed for the rest of my life, I have been cancer free for 10 years and I am not paralyzed I do MMA. This is a lesson to listen to your mom's
This song is fucking perfect
What an awesome powerful song. Thank you.
😭😭 my papaw is dying of cancer they told him theres nothing they can do that he needed to go home and die
I've lost a few family members just in the last year to cancer.... two more just diagnosed in the last few months. Thank you for this song.
Radiation oncology nurse - thank you Tom. I see the fight every day. These patients DO have fire. They inspire and impress me everyday with their resilience. Good work sir. Keep it up!🥰💓
That was amazing thank you for being a genuine person
You are the most amazing artist ever! Thank you for all you do you honestly have no idea what your songs and videos  mean to me and how they have helped me in so many ways to cope!
My aunt just past from cancer this mad me cry i miss her so much
How do people hit the dislike button on a song so powerful?!?!?! I'm so confused on how you could dislike someone so bad that a message like this could go over your head thank you Tom for all the work you do to be the person who can stand in the eyes of so much hate and still spread positivity and so much love♥️❣️♥️❣️
This made my wife cry as well as me ..see she kicked cancer ass but the treatment she got ..gave her skin cancer i wasn't with her in her first battle but im here now ..she shared it with her fellow survivors ..thanks Tom. Been following you when i heard white boy and you have only gotten stronger love you man
As a cancer survive of Breast cancer and chemo, thank you thank you ❤️
No one will probably read this too far down comments but just waiting to hear if we start this journey with my mum we find out tomorrow.  I dont know what it is with your music, you seem to say the right things at the right time for me and my husband.  2020 has seen alot of bad things happen to many and we have had more than our share with 1 major op for me 1 breakdown for partner 1 brothers leukemia has returned 1 mum diagnosed with leukaemia 1 dad diagnosed with diabetes 1 mum possible cancer diagnosis and it goes on but through it all tom and nova and all the #hangovergang have been there to pull us along and given us the strength to get up each morning and live. So from the bottom of our hearts please keep doing what you are doing it's been a hell of a  ride thankyou ❤❤❤
Holy fuck dude this is amazing.
🖤❤🖤❤🖤
You are awesome.  This was awesome.   Thank you.  😢❤️

The reason they don’t wanna give the cure is they wanna get rid of the human population.

Thanks for making a grown man cry.
@tommacdonald I myself caught cancer and worry every day it will affect my son or come back to me this song hits home just like everything you do love the most much love
Oh wow, nice
The timing of this song couldn't be any better.  One of my brother's  is going thru all the steps to rid him of it now. Its taking a toll on him for sure. I sent him this song in hopes it gives him strength.  #F~~kcancer,
I’ve been trying to say this shit for years, doesn’t make sense.. good job tmac
There is away off this rock alive. Name is Jesus let him take your worries away.

Awesome video man
Awesome!!
I DROPPED 30 SONGS I WROTE OR SPIT OFF THE TOP IN 1 MONTH  GO FWM AND RUNNIT UP🚀🚀🚀🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dang Tom, this is true music, true rap. Hip Hop was meant to bring us up and not down the way main stream hiphop does so much respect man.
Thank You.... Nova and Tom Thank You.
Thank you for this. our son passed away this morning at 7:00 from a dipg brain tumor. he was 4 years old. he has been fighting for a few months now and when we heard your song it hit hard. We love your music. Amazing.
This is Inspirantional
The hard fact always finds it’s way,,,, thanks for telling the hard fact bro,,, I’m sending love and prayers from Africa- Gambia 🇬🇲 to everyone beautiful soul out there in the world that needs it♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏🏽
WHATS FUKUSHIMA I DONT RUN FOR THE CURE I FIGHT THE ONES THAT GAVE IT TO ME I WAS GIVEN 2 MTHS TO LIVE 9 YEARS AGO TODAY, AML LEUKEMIA THE FIGHT IS THE LIFE
Thank you for this song my brother died at 41 from bone cancer.
Holy shit this hit me hard because my mom had cancer at age 14 and she's a miracle that's she's alive I just don't hope it comes back
I have lost most of my family to cancer...I'm positive they have the cure but they make more $$$ off death than healing us
One of my friend has cancer and passed away
This actually made me weep. Every word is true and it's sadly a horrific experience. I appreciate your talent for wordsmithing.  Thank you Tom, Nova and all that involved in bringing this to fruition. Bravo sir! Bravo.
The tears this song makes me have, is so cleansing to my soul.
Damn this gave me goose bumps all over. I felt many parts of this song! 💯💙🎶🔥
I heard the song earlier today, but it’s much much better with video of course, this was amazing as always ty keep up the good work, u and nova always bring it, and keep it 100 u rock... great job nova
Thank you for this
Appreciate you brother. My sister just went through breast cancer and we are still fighting strong. Would be cool if we could stop the pollution of our bodies and prevent cancer but you’re right the medical system makes wayyy too much money off cancers existence than they would without it
Damn, this hits close, I had cancer and the age of 6 and had it for 3 years and it was a really hard journey to go through but I made it
I know this is sick because I’ve seen what happens when people lose loved ones to cancer, but I used to wish I had cancer so I would die but it gave my family time to process without it being sudden like suicide
Thank you so much for this, Tom!  I've lost my Mom, Uncle and several friends from Cancer.  There's a family history, so I'm always worried about it.  I quit smoking more than 7 years ago now, but I smoked for a loooong time.  Who knows what will happen.  All I know is I've got a sick tat that says #FuckCancer  #HOGFam4Ever
Absolutely amazing I loved the lyrics of the song from your CD and now with the visual it brings your words to life❤️ Fuck Cancer!
This gave me crying cancer It really touched me
Very awesome track and incredible video... Tom yoi hit grand slam with this one bro...thanks much love
By far this guy has my most respect an amazing human
That this is reality
Thank you for always speaking your truth. Thank you for this song.
😪🤮makes me sick
I lost my best friend 2 years ago to stomach cancer, it kills me everyday but im so amazingly grateful for Tom addressing this nd shit, the best of luck to anyone going through it or know someone that's going through it, and RIP to all of those that lost the fight ❤
This one was rough...
I lost my step-dad this summer due to cancer. It was a quick transformation. In the span of 3 months he went from 200 to 140. RIP Scott.
This song as amazing my dad has it
People if you start thinking you will find the answers.Questioning sheds light on it.
Honestly if i get some huge disease just let me die lmao i aint feeding the machine. Ill either get through it or die.
240 dislikes!! Wtf!! Keeping shit real!
I just lost my uncle to cancer. He was a cowboy and damn it hurt so much seeing him suffer at the end. He refused meds other than for pain. It sucks and it hurts, but this song speaks truth. Well done Tom and Nova.
My brother passed from cancer at 18, it cost so much, my parents are still paying the hospital bills,the cost are insane, as if it’s not bad enough, to go into debt that much, sad, hopefully one day, something will change
You are a fucking real G my bro ❤
All I gotta say this song hits home as I might have brain cancer
I lost my aunt to cancer and you speak the truth
Add a link to donate to st jude or something
this made me cry. ive lost half my family to cancer. god bless you
Thank you for this. Cancer survivor myself!!
We love you TOM Keep up the GOAT work!
This is fantastic yet again, I found you from "people so stupid" and have been following you on here and FB,Inst.. Been effected by this song more than any other, thank you Tom... great work ..
Run from the cure..(Rick Simpson) dad started his this week with a quickness they got him started but he has to wait months for a medical marijuana card. How does that make sense?!!.. good thing it's everywhere now ;)
I dislike all your stuff if it has no dislikes even if i like it couldnt do it this time
Damn. You keep putting out amazing videos with TRUTH
Thank you Tom and nova. This helps me a lot. My grand father is currently fighting prostate cancer and my grand mother unfortunately was taken by breast cancer a couple of years ago..... Y'all got me in tears man. Beautiful song.
Damn Tom you never disappoint man. I feel bad calling you a rapper, because you are truly an artist and put your heart n soul into every song. Rapper, producer, and manager, this guy does it all himself and I feel people don't give him enough credit. No one's got shit on Tom MacDonald 💯 keep up the amazing work man, you touch souls
Ohhh bro this this is truly amazing song will touch alot off hearts 💕 this 😪
lost my grandmother to cancer 5 months ago and then lost my father to cancer 2 months ago and now my uncle was just diagnosed a couple weeks ago it seems like its inevitable i hope one day we are able to end this.
May you live forever So that you can speak the truth to the world .....remember you will always be loved stay strong brother
My cousin died of cancer in 2017 after fighting it 3year
I lost my dad to cancer and i can say this song means so much
Thank you, my fiancé and mother of our two young children was just diagnosed with leukemia at 25 years old and showed her this song. Helped a lot.
Very important song brother! Prostate cancer at age 45, I’m 49 now and still standing! To those still in the fight my prayers for you all! Thank you Tom for yet another critically important song !  Love This guy!
My mom passed in Nov last year from her second round of breast cancer. She was ready to go after being stabbed by needles and just the pain alone. I couldn't even see her old self in her face anymore. I have the mutated genes she has. I have 3 daughters and I'm almost to my mom's age when she was first diagnosed. I don't want my ladies to see me fall like that.
Thank you for this song! Like most people, I, too, have lost my grandpa to cancer. He was fighting for years and I watched him wither, but I am glad I was next to him holding his hand when he passed away in the hospital. But his pain ended there, for which I am glad. Everyone should try to be kinder to each other and make sure you spend time together with your loved ones. You never know when they are gonna go, cherish them.
Tom, you are literally the single most talented artist I’ve ever seen. Every song is amazing and the rate you keep producing them is insane. Keep up the good work!!
Well done this song has hit me hard becouse i just lost a uncle 2 weeks ago tomorrow due to stage 4 cancer so amazing Tom well all ur musice is amazing keep up the good work
Omg so sad heart breaking Tom love ya 😢💔💖
awesome song/video. One minute and I have tears in my eyes.
Powerful AF we are..
Y would anyone dislike stuff like this I prolly will never understand.   Anyone going through this needs encouragement and to know win or lose there is a light at the end of their long struggle. If you are fighting this battle stay strong and if you are helping someone through this fight stay stronger. YOU CAN BEAT THE CANCER!!!!
WOW this one gave me chills thank you Tom
I just got diagnosed with It for the second time. And my father in law just died Sept. 29th from it thank you bro.
Great song brother hands down no contest! Speaking from one of the people who has lost multiple people due to cancer this one hit me in all the heart strings brother. You did an amazing job and I love all your music, keep up the great work and keep striving to set standards and always be Tom!
You are truly an amazing artist. And Nova is hella talented. Much love and positivity ya’lls way ❤️💪
A forever fan and advocate of you tom I am now..... I believe you and see you. Your heart is rare. And thank you for this video. Your energy transferred  to me. Namaste
My mom died of cancer 10 years ago, it still hurts to think about. This song hits hard, in a good way. Cancer has a cure. Keep speaking facts tom
Who can thumbs down this song its so uplifting.
Man I don't even have words, what a great job you did.  I lost my dad too pancreatic cancer the day before my 23rd birthday.  Man, this song is some real shit,  thank you
I myself am a survivor and have lost several special people in my life due to cancer. Just found out my friend has it and this came out at such a perfect time!! Thanku
❤😢💗💗 Again another masterpiece. Sad truth. Emotional. Brought me to tears. Hit close to home. Your so raw. What makes you so great.
such a good song with such a good meaning
**stands** 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Tom MacDonald is the greatest rapper in this generation and if you disagree well i hope you brought a headgard
This hit me hard. Awesome work Tom.
This guy is special and anyone who says otherwise is a mug.
You made me cry Tom, you bastard =P
Just saw my albums arrived. Can’t wait man. Wow
Yeah, my mom died of cancer 7 years ago. Her last words while my whole family watched her pass were "this sucks"......
Thanks Tom! This is long overdue for artists to speak on this issue. I have chronic pain and autoimmune disease and can completely relate to this! It’s a daily struggle to keep fighting the pain and get through your day. However, I’m always shocked at how much I can take. I feel like the lyrics to your bridge came directly out of my soul! I wish I could give you a hug!  The timing of this being dropped is Divine as well, this has been a really hard few months for me physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, financially, if anything could go wrong it has... so I keep looking for the blessings in my life and I am extremely grateful for everything I do have and my amazing husband and family. Take Care Tom & Nova! 👍🥰💕
🔥real shit always shines
you know we have a cure........ But why is it kept from us ??  power over us is what they want! great song Tom thx for caring for the unknown!
Dude this hit deep my mom just bet cancer
Nailed it on the head!! Truth and love it!!
This hit me straight in my feels man keep up the great work ..... lost to many people and family members to it ....
Keep doing you Tom you and Nova ROCK!
Amen
Amazing song with a beautiful message. Awesome work Tom. Love your music.
Amazing song. I have lost family members to cancer had members survive it and have 1 actively fighting it. Fuck Cancer is all I can say.
Well this made me tear up. Cancer hits so close to home.
Maybe the best song you've released so far. In my opinion anyway. Keep up the good work Sir
This hits close to home.  I hate cancer with passion. Fuck cancer.   Thanks Tom.
Facts. ✌️
I found out 2 days ago that I have liver and bowel cancer
If an artist doesn’t make you think are they really an artist ?  Great job as always brother.
this is so beautyfull and meaning full , thank you Tom
I’ve lost several important family members to cancer through my life I don’t talk about it much ignore the images of what the devil did to my grandmother and grandfather specifically. Seeing that is what made me realize there is a Jesus Christ who cares to not let us suffer beyond what we can handle. Thank you Tom..
Dude...
How relevant 5 days ago I found out my grandpa has grandpa
Damn it who cutting onions?!
I got when I was 16 2 yrs poking and prying when I said im done and started smoking I stop hurting idk if ima die soon but ill never go back to those meds
Thanks, Tom. That was beautiful.
RIP Papa Bob. 💔😭
My mother had breast cancer. Thank you tom.
Best rapper ever
This is such a beautiful song on so many different levels.
This song hits different ive lost so many people to cancer im only 19 and have lost like 10 people just to cancer my aunt is currently fighting cancer we just found out like 2 days ago so it is sort of weird that this video came out now
❤
Fkn YASSS ❤️❤️❤️ so proud of you!
"People So Stupid" is the greatest song ever written in the history of civilization.
Wow, just wow
Fuck sakes. TOM!!! YOU HAD ME IN TEARS IN THE FIRST 15 SECONDS!!! I lost my grandmother to breast cancer...  As always you have absolutly blown me away. You never fail to amaze me with your ability to rap, and go hard, and then turn around and sing something like this that is absolutly heartfelt and touching, It is seriously no surprise how or why you have the amazing g fan base that you do standing behind you! Your awesome!
I just wanna let you know I appreciate this song. I'm an AML survivor. Not long ago I was goin through all chemo n crap to get it in remission. Then I had a bone marrow transplant so still goin through post-cancer stuff. Im sure others an fans like me will appreciate this too. Keep it up man.
It's sad the way we fight/pay to stay alive. They don't want a cure for everything because it's not as profitable
I lost my dad to cancer when I was 25. He was my best friend. This shit hits home hard 😤😢
My mother was 45 when she passed from brain cancer & I was 20. I’m turning 45 this December and my health isn’t the best. I appreciate you making this more then you know. My mom was my best friend.
May not be a cure but I know it helps I've been researching it for months
Tom McDonald please read this
I watched my aunt battle leukemia for two years until it went into remission, just for her body to start shutting down from all the medication and treatments. Fuck cancer.
Thank you for this, Tom. I was diagnosed 11 months ago lost my insurance a month after I was diagnosed and can not get treatment.
I have what may be a cure
Rest In Peace Beti, September 3rd, 2020. Thanks for this Tom
233 dislikes what the fuck y'all don't like about this?  Love your work man keep up the good work
Thank you so much for this song alot of love for you Tom!
To anyone who disliked this video. I hope you never have to feel the overwhelming pain, caused by the lose of a loved one! RIP to all those lost and missed!
Coca-Cola causes cancer cause dementia two levels below battery acid
I lost my mom to lung cancer, lost my dad to brain cancer, recently lost my best friend to ovarian cancer.  I miss them so much, i would give anything just to be able to spend 1 day with them again.
Thank you Tom!! Cancer sucks 💯💯💯💯
Not a single half naked woman,flashy car, big ass house or stack of money in sight, just 💯 honesty, and pure heart.  Tom you are such a special human and an incredible artist 🙏 thankyou from a fellow Tom 🙌
Thank you for making a good track.
Thank you Tom! This song was amazing and touching. I know the stress of families that had someone close get cancer, including myself. Personally my father and two family friends had cancer.  You make perfect songs with a message and that is why I will always be a fan!
You legend Tom !!!!
Love the song. This will touch alot of people.
Found out I had Leukemia in 2011. My brother gave me a Stem Cell Bone Marrow Transplant in 2015. I am now in Remisson, out of 5 of my friends I am the only one on that Cancer floor that made it. I still stay sick but my immune is getting better every year. Never give up the faith or hope God with bring you through it. Thank you so much for this song. God Bless .
Why does youtube trend 6ixe9ines trash everytime he drops a song but they won't trend Tom MacDonalds
Absolutely the reason I started following your music! So much greatness in this one!
100% FIRE And TRUTH !
david foster wallace is rolling around in his grave
God I get goosebumps every time I hear his music
This is a banger thanks Tom for this you just made a bunch of peoples day with this day
Another 🔥 song
😭😭❤️
My Mother passed away in 2017 from cancer 5 year battle. your song speaks truth.... they told her she had 5 years before any treatment what so ever.  it’s like they told my mother her death date. So was that a way of saying we can only poison you for this long. then your body will give up? All the money all the Research and all the advance treatments. And you’re being treated like it’s the first cancer that was ever discovered. I Can’t have my mother back but I can pray for all of you that have family in this situation or friends RIP MOM 🙏 great song Tom 👍
Damn. This song is powerful. Good job, bro.
Bless bro I love this but if I get it I'm glad that someone who i care about doesn't have to go through it. I've  been told to stop smoking or I would have mouth cancer in 12 to 18 mouth. Xx
This has a big message
This song actually got me in the feels.. cancer is a serious thing. And it's sad to watch people go.  Like it's the most awful thing to have.
Nice song making doctors look bad. good intentions from a fucking idiot.
This hit me very hard. I have lost 5 family members to cancer. It’s so hard to watch someone go through it. Just to sit by and know you really can’t do anything to help them. It crushed me to my soul. To lose both my parents within 5 months of each other to cancer.
I found out yesterday dat my friends 5-7 years old sister has I think two tumors on her kidney
Damnit Tom, my feels 🥺😢
My grandmother died of cancer this year this hits hard
Love this song man it hits hard I've lost so many to cancer.
Man. Got me all up in my feels.
The phucked up thing is they do have a cure but they're not going to make any money off the cure. So they sit and watch people suffer like it's some game to them.
I was diagnosed with cancer recently in lymphnode in my chest. A upper mediastinal lymphnode. It is a simple surgery. But i don't know how i am going to survive missing work and the hospital costs.  This song really hits me hard.
Hard! have lost my dad from cancer at 7 years! Very good! I hope you gona be hear, it's a powerfull message...Good Movember
I need help to keep fighting  💜💜💙 You are really good with the TRUTH
Love your music since day 1 I've heard it. This song is amazing and really touched my woman and myself as she just finished her treatments and we find out soon if her cancer is gone. Keep bein you homie we need more real people and artist back in our world! ✌🏾
Goosebumps aye yo tom if you see this I feel you could make a fire ass song called goosebumps
U are the best at saying what needs to be said when no one wants to say it or talk about it thank u
So fucking true Tom
What kind of heartless ass down voted this video?!
🦅
i love tom i think hes an amazing artist....but this song shouldnt be  sung against....theres a reason why we all call the fucker c...in my opinion with trillions ov love tom...this word should not be sang about...beating it...living it... gettin over it ,..it dont matter, its a word thats killed millions...an it doest belong tapping your foot to...
Thank you for making this.
Always keeping it real!
Great song thanks tom and nova
I didn't cry, what are you talking about?
Thank you💕
Im 5 hours late😭
I lost my friend and mentor to cancer, he was a big part of my life since I was 13 years old. We shared the same birthday, he was my karate instructor and a person to help keep me calm when it felt like the world was crashing around me. Not a day goes by that I don’t think of him and not a day goes by that I don’t help but think why couldn’t he be saved.
I've have been dealing with Ewing's Sarcoma for a little over a year now and so far after dealing with chemotherapy, having surgery to remove the tumor and going through radiation, so far, I'm doing okay, however I'm not in the green light just yet but I know that I'm gonna get better soon. My family, friends and I still are praying and waiting for the day when I finally get cured.  Oh and Tom...thank you for the song. It's good to know that others like me can listen to a song like this and feel that we'll be strong enough to make it. So again, thank you for being such a great man.  EDIT: Also, to those who are facing against cancer or to those who have family and/or friends who are dealing with cancer, stay strong.
Sucks I can only like this once
Damn...
I lost many people i know to cancer and my grandmother was one of them thank you for making this it brought all the good memories of her and how damn stubborn that old lady was back to me and i can't tell you how much it means to me again thank you
The cure is a well planned vegan diet
Tom , this song is bringing me to tears. I am fighting stage 4 colon cancer.  I will fight it to the end.  This helps renew my fight for life..  I love   Your music Tom, keep it going..  Hangover gang!!!
Cancer has several cures. You can look up the patents
This hits home hard man cancer took my grandma my brother and my mom and watching them fich cancer gave me what I need to fight addiction all they way up till my mom passed I respect you even more as a human being just for making this song man
It's all a bunch of bullshit! Where is all the money going? Pockets getting deeper...there is a cure but greed takes priority! They are killing us with the food and cigarettes! I hope all of these politicians and doctors and everyone else who has chosen greed over cure gets this horrible disease and suffers as much as my pops did!
This brought tear to my eyes man, Hits close, please keep it up man
Cancer had taken most of the people I hold dearest, One day I too like other will have to stare death in the face, and even though the Grim Repear  will come for me, Ill drag that son of a bitch with me for all the hell and sadness hes caused me and others
I'm a 2x leukemia survivor, its fucking hard!!
Deep...just shared with a close family member with this struggle and not getting answers from doctors.
This video is harsh man, teared up right away... Thank you. For bringing music that talks about real issues.
This really is one of the best songs you have made
That hit so close to home bro you don't even know. non hogkins lymphoma just over a 4 year fight cancer in my intestines 13 surgeries in all 2 rounds of chemo in the 4 years that grabbed the heart strings hard in remission since October 2017
This song literally brought me to my knees, it hit me so hard. My uncle beat the cancer, but the surgery he had to have led to complications which killed him and his memorial is today. He was such a positive force in my life and the most reliable father figure I had, and he fought so hard and after everything, he's still gone and the world is worse for it.
Dealing with testicular cancer right now. Just found out yesterday, that even though they removed my left testicle; hoping that would cut out my cancer, it's still getting worse, growing, & spreading. Elevated from stage 1 to a high stage 2. Gotta start chemo within the next 30 days. No way around it I guess. Gotta do it to try & fight & hopefully recede it. FUCKING SUCKS. I'm scared. But, I've always been a fighter. So, I'm tryna keep a positive mind & warrior through, like I always do. LOV3 this song. Really 'preciate you for making this. You the man Tom
🥱
Why you gotta make me cry tho?? My grandmother had cancer 4 times.
"There's no money in healthy people.  And there's no money in dead people.  The money is in the middle: people who are alive,  sort of, but with one or more chronic conditions..."
Thank you Tom for this video.. My best friend had cancer for more than 8 years and passed away 2 weeks ago.. It was hard watching him suffer.. He is a beautiful soul and a very wise person.. Cancer made him understand a lot of good things.. But took him away too soon.. For all the people going through cancer, I wish you find your way to heal and hopefully we can get rid of the cancerous pharmaceutical industry who do not see us as people.. The true healing process has been kept hidden from us and the powers that be are wanting to kill us.. Seek alternative treatment and let's take back our powers
Lost both of my folks to cancer😞 This is a powerful track, thanks Tom🙏🏻💯
🥺
This hits so close to home. My best friend died from cancer 2 years ago. Only 16 years old. Through most of middle school he had to battle  the cancer. Having to travel from norway to germany to get treatment. And the thought that in some years there might be a cure that would have saved him. If only the cancer had developet later he might have survived,
My dad, the strongest man I've ever known, my rock, my hero got cancer in late 2017 (throat, tongue, lymph and tonsils) ....they said that he beat it!  3 months later it came back but to his liver and ribs, prostate.  They said he beat it,  6 months later they said its returned and is now in his back, T3, T8, T12-13, T-18, Postural sacrum ,Postural ilium ,Liver (2spots), Poster femur, Rib multiple ribs,Humerus cancer. in March 2020 they said
Thank you for make this song
Tom always says the truth
Wow. I was just diagnosed with cancer 2 weeks ago. This hit hard.
Bad news😭
Thank you so much for this emotional trip Tom. When going through what seems to be the hardest battle in the world and not knowing if your going to wake up and see tomorrow. This is why I love your music because you are real and honest with it you give it to us straight and what is crazy the truth always hurts but I would rather be given straight then with a lied curved blade place under my neck. Again thank you for what you do. Much love my brother.
😔
My mother was diagnosed 3 months ago....thank you brother
The message behind this song is so powerful ..
Wow just Wow... ❤❤❤
Maybe this will get people to stop throwing that word around so loosely
damn tom this is deep.
I feel like they won’t release the cure to “help” with world population.....think of this way if everyone survived a sickness the world wouldn’t have any space....... No one deserve to die..and if you serviced cancer congratulations, I love you!❤️
I share something on my facebook page like once a year. Shared this proudly...Thanks again Tom
These messages in these songs though is something people should take seriously
My mom has cancer this one hit home🙏🙌
Fruits and vegetables ONIONS
Tom Mcdonald cares
This hits home for me. I was diagnosed with cancer 6 months ago. You truly are the best keep speaking truth brother.
Powerful fucking song!! Cancer is honestly the only damn thing I am scared of in this world. It isn't racism, heart disease, obesity, etc and damn sure isn't covid-19. But not matter what you do, no one is immune to cancer, so many people are getting rich off it and in my opinion there is a cure but it's population control. Thanks for song Tom!! Always keeping it 💯. Much love bro!!
My mom died from lung cancer 3 years ago. I know there is a cure. They just make way too much money off of cancer. They will probably never release the cure.
FACTS 💯🙏
Balls man , my wife lost her uncle at 3am today from pancreatic cancer after a 2 year fight.
Goddamn bro, that was pure emotion
Tom u always do better and better
Mans an artist
The governments gonna get em
This song touched my heart. I was 29years old with stage for breast cancer. I have been in remission for almost 10 years now and I just last my mom 2 1/2 years ago doe cancer of the stomach. It ended up taking over her whole body. Thank you for this song.
Now two of my favorite songs are titled Cancer.
Powerful, love this. You never fail to impress me, I wish I couldn’t relate to this but I can and you couldn’t have said it better. 👏🏻
Shout out to Canada's boy Terry Fox
This shit hit so hard... my best friend (only friend in the world) just found out she has cancer a couple of weeks ago. She's getting ready to have surgery in a few days, I'm scared, she's scared, her family I'm sure is she scared. If I could I would rather have it instead of her...
"There's a cure that they refuse to make"  That's the most honest line I've ever heard
Saw this on ArtofKickz reaction and man you got me. And your right, big medicine is a scam and Doctors aren't taught to cure, they're taught to treat. I've never met a doctor that says he's going to cure me of anything. Only that they're going to treat illnesses. And I know what it's like to lose someone to cancer as my father and maternal grandfather both lost that battle, as did my once future mother-in-law.
I lost my grandfather before i born, but he was only 51. He could still live. Thanks for this song. Its really good.
Beautiful song
Well said Tom! I believe they've got cure at the end of the day it's all about £££$$$$ I believe if we stopped donating ''surprise'' they're hv a cure. Another classic from Tom! I'm proud of you mate.
Omg this shit hit so hard
September makes 4 years cancer-free. Only cost me my reproductive organs. Not an easy choice for a 31-year-old with an old lady's cancer and no children. UPDATE       I can't stop listening to this song.
Power in words  Tom your one of the most gifted poets of our time. Powerful words tugging on our hearts and minds always.
Who the fuck hit the dislike button. Tom you never fail to amaze us with your music. Love from the UK.
Wow that's an amazing song with an amazing message someone needed to hear everytime the chorus came on I cried man I tried not to but it pulls on your heartstrings keep making meaningful music Tom your awesome
I have cancer. I been through chemo. And doing radiation now. I've been lucky. Others aren't as lucky tho
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ deep bars bro but so true 🤘 keep spitting the truth never back down right
Sound.. there is a certain Hz that causes cancer cells to die without all these chemicals. Cansema can be made into a paste that removals cancer. It binds to the cancer and causes your body to reject cancer.. (warning: it's going to hurt because the infected skin is being separated from the good skin)
Beautiful song Tom, this is Grammy worthy man for sure! Hitting the heart strings man!
i lost my dad to cancer and i currently have cancer. i love this so hard. thank you. 🖤🤘
It might be one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.  Love your work, Tom.  Keep the spirits soaring.
I lost both my parents to cancer. I'm three years in remission. I "may" have won but the scars will never leave. I cried when I got the diagnosis and not since....Until now.... Thank you Tom.
Wow this hits so close to home. Cancer doesn't care who you are or what you do. I've lost one sister, one brother and one brother who has beat cancer twice. As you say: keep fighting!!!
Thanks Tom!!! This hits home and this definitely will make a lot of people feel stronger in their time of darkness! Much love
Love this song bro, 100/10🔥🔥🔥
Thank u Tom my mom passed last year a couple days after my birthday this song helps me
This boy has a sweet heart
The government has the cure but they make to much from people i swear
Tomorrow is the anniversary of my mom becoming an angel. Small cell lung cancer. Andrea Sue Kamits, say her name so it's not forgotten. F.C.
amazing song dude I can relate
Awesome 👏 I was 14 years old and held my paternal grandfathers hand as he died from lung cancer, less than a year later , after helping my mom take care of him, my maternal grandfather died of brain cancer. My senior year of high school a friend died of lukimea. My dad beat throat cancer, lung cancer and survived 5 heart attacks only to have his heart finally give up a few years ago. The lyrics hit on a lot of levels which is what you do so well and nova that was a good video and captured the lyrics well!!
I just lost my grandma who raised me to cancer and this right here almost made me cry
There are heaps of cures for cancer out there but none of them are from the conventional medical route.
My mom and my dad passed away 3 months apart from lung cancer and that was the darkest time in my life. I think about them every single day!!
Back in the day I worked bio-pharmaceutical as a non-destructive technician (welding inspection) for hygienic piping. I worked at a facility where they were working on 2 drugs , one smaller Nupogen, and a stronger one called Epogen. I'll let you know that the entire facility cost to build the plant was somewhere in the $238mm ballpark. A batch can only be 14 days, because they have to passivate the mixing tanks, and the hygienic piping. That means there is  2 batches in a month. 4 batches, that's 2 months worth of production at $80 a pill paid for the entire jobsite to be built.
Another well done song, that actually talks about real life what people are going though everyday and we are all affected with cancer in someway.  Have to say the video work was top notch well done Nova and Tom. Prayers to anyone facing this or is dealing with this in there life right now.
i lost my sister by another mother to pancreatic cancer. I loved her so much, I think of her everyday. Love you Carol!!!
'building a business on addiction, we are paying them to kill ourselfs, we are dying to keep living.' man this is a hard one, almost teared up one this one. keep telling truths Tom.
Cancer is part of the plan.
Maybe the villains are the super heroes. Because every that calls you a Villain but your a hero to me
That was awesome thank you Tom
Awesome
Thank you Tom for this! My mom just went threw this i watched her suffering it was so bad it made me suffer to. You are so kind for this song I can't help but feel weak sitting here crying and listening to it.
Is there nothing Tom MacDonald won’t do fo his fans?! Tough but real Tom. Nicely done
🔥 🔥
I can't even begin to describe how this song made me feel.... my wife was diagnosed with cancer last month. Thank you for this. You're an amazing artist.
Excellent Mate, you'll help a lot of people with this song
Str8 goosebumps bro
BRAVO...I FUCKING love it
Tom, I just wanted to let you know that a few minutes before you released this song on youtube my dad told us that his bone marrow tested cancer free. This is by far my favorite song of yours, ok all of your songs are amazing but this one touched my soul. Keep up the great work, much love!
👏🙌 fucking amazing
Another amazing work of art.
I lost a fellow brother who was 27 just recently. A fireman who saved so many lives in his career of fighting fires volunteering his life for those whom he never knew. Didnt matter you color age race he was their to risk his life for yours. It seemed weird when i saw tom just drop this cuz its almost like my friend told him about his struggle. He beat cancer and rang the bell but you are never out of the clear. When i got the news i couldnt believe why god would take such a loving soul from us and i still have no answers. All i can say is that he was the light to any dark room he walked into. Thank you tom for making this song. Dylan would have loved it and im sure hes listening in heaven. Keep your loved ones close and tell all of the first responders you meet whether stranger or friend that you love them. SAY HIS NAME 💪DYLAN SMITH❤️
Cancer sucks D I was 15 when my mom got it and  I just turned 22 when she passed going through all that time I never left her side she fought a long hard road there was many nights I laid awake listening to her cry herself to sleep because the doctors would not give her anything strong enough to take away the pain and it gets hard taking care of a loved one it takes a toll on you and them I watch my mom go from full of live to an empty shell and still to this day I have nightmares about the night she passed in my arms I’m sorry to rattle on what I’m trying to say is tell your kids of parents and even significant other that you love them cause you never know when it’s the last so my prayers go out to everyone fighting this disease and caregivers don’t give up and have a blessed day thank you Tom Macdonald for this awesome video❤️🔥💯💯
I swear if win lottery I'll give you all bc money isn't everything, this song touches my soul. I lost my mom to cancer three years ago the heartaches and pain is still there like yesterday, but I can't imagine anyone better doing a song that speaks to us  your lyrics are a blessing thankyou.  Keep up food work
In the last two months my mother and her brother have both been diagnosed with different cancers. Hers wasn't as scary. My uncle's is. So many tumors growing so fast...this is so relevant to my life right now. Thanks Tom.
Thank you soooooo much Tom and Nova! Grandma taken from cancer, aunts and uncles all taken from this. But "Dont give up and know your strong, you are a fighter!" Love you both keep it up guys please! Love from Ohio!
Love the video #TomMacDonald it did bring tears to my eyes, cause made me remember few years back when my mom fought cancer strong till the end, but sadly it took her, but still loved song
I know in general you receive allt of shit from lots of people for a number of your songs. But man you should receive nothing but praise for this one. Keep up the good work
Song couldnt have come at a better time man thank u I just sent it to her and her wife. She said one of the Kemo treatments felt like she was swallowing glass. So she stopped and now shesbon her own and its getting worse it's so scary to watch someone you love deteriorate
Thanks, this song home with me. I don’t have cancer, I have severe autoimmune diseases that are attacking me trying to kill me slowly but surely. My immune system has attacked my digestive system, destroying my colon, my gallbladder, my spleen and is currently working to destroy my liver and thyroid. I’m sick enough now that I need to have a liver transplant but due to my financial situation I have to try to fundraise at least $7100 to be qualified to be on the list. The hospital I am working with has given me till January 2021, basically 2 1/2 months to get the money so start trying to find someone else  to start the process again. I am working with the  National Foundation for Transplants  and thus far only been able to raise $2300 😔 I need help and have found no other help in sight . It’s so scary to be basically poor but make too much to be eligible for any real help. The US is a great place to live until you really need help and don’t have any connection because money means everything, and life means nothing if you don’t have.
h hh hhh hhhh hhhhh hhhhhh hhhhhhh hhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhh great song hhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhh hhhhhhh hhhhhh hhhhh hhhh hhh hh h
Thank you 🙏🏼 very strong song. That will help keep fighting the battles on cancer and the understanding of it and it’s heartbreaking complications
Bro my eyes are watering 💯🔥😭 thats so real it seriously ain't funny DAMMIT BRO 🙌🤘👊👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🤘🤘👏👏👏🤘
My stepdad died of bone marrow cancer...is truly a sad thing to see them go thru, all his pain and nothing helped..thank you for making this and sharing to the world, always so much respect!!!!
I cried I just got told after two years if fighting I'm in remission your my idol Tom keep doing you bro much respect 😍 anyone battling with it or who knows someone fighting it I'm always here to talk love you all stay safe
Tom is a rapper who calls out any and every problem and people call him corny when he spits the truth.
SPEAKING FACTSSSSS FINALLY SOMEONE SAID IT
Like the late and great George Carlin would say, “ They don’t give a fuck about you” sad to say but evidently true. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone, but at the same time we can’t pretend like this ain’t happening. It’s true, 100 billion dollar industry and we can’t find a cure, hmm 🤔 I don’t buy it, but great song my brother, truly had some tears to shed on this one because of the powerful message, keep being you, much love
Tom/Nova What awesome song /video as I fight
As someone who has lost people I love to cancer, this hit me hard. Thank you
My grandfather passed away 2 years ago from cancer thank you Tom
Wow..... That's deep af. Ur right... We've all been touched by it. 😭😭🙏
Love your videos and I played this song for my mom when I heard because she beat cancer and I wish I could have my grandma listen to it because she unfortunately passed with 2 types of cancer. Never let that fire extinguish
Damn this hit my feels hard Edit: thank you for making this
Very beautifull video Nova.thank you
🤧
I’m 21 and I lost my mother to cancer last year . She had it since I was 10 years old and she was a true warrior. Unfortunately it spread everywhere and she just couldn’t fight it anymore.. R.I.P Mumma I love you. We would listen to your songs all the time 😇
Perfect song for my girlfriends young cousin she needs it! Keep up the amazing work Tom! Don’t stop for anyone
You are Truly my hero for making this song i have been battling Cancer for over two years struggling to get treated you're music is a saving grace in a world that has begun to burn...at least I know with people as kind as you we will always be warm...❤
Thank You, nothing more needs to be said.
Thx for this song!! Amazing Tom again
Thank you tom. My grandfather got cancer last year. He fought it. Just this year it came back. This means lot.
My aunt has stage 4 pancreatic cancer and dosen't have long..... never did drugs never smoked I just dont get it man
Cut all the sugar out. Cancer feeds on carbs! Now pay me!
i dont agree with every song, but he puts out some of the most substantial content musically out of anyone Ive heard. He is dropping a lot of truth and ive seen a little hypocritical type things, but it seems like he mostly genuine.  I really hope I dont find out he has ties to intelligence like almost every other 'real' artist in the past...
I lost my grandfather and step dad to cancer my aunt also had it she was a fighter and battled it all the way shes alive and traveling the world be strong 💪 and spread love to everyone you never know who's struggling and who might have a week left to live you never know what someone else might be going through what demons they are facing. thanks tom ❤
Appreciate your work and this really hit home. Been 2 years my Father passed from lung and spine cancer, was there every step of the way till his last breath. It's never easy, but the old man always held his head high and never let it beat his sense of humor 🤙 Stay Strong.
I can’t stop listening and therefore can’t stop crying. . . Got my chest burning. You’re an extremely talented artist sir respect. 💜💯
Turn to Jesus.
Thanks Tom.this song is very nice.thank you
Not sure who will see this but I just wanna share a little about my mother who passed away from cancer. She was a loving and caring preschool teacher. She would do arts and crafts with all the kids on my street growing up. A cub Scout leader for many young kids (myself included)..I wouldn't be the person I am today without her.. I miss you mom and I love you.
My mum just won the fight against cancer.. I want to have a tattoo with the date  Does anyone have ideas?
Man another great song man keep it up!!!!
Thank you tom. Coming from someone who, nearly all of the funerals I have gone to in my life have been due to cancer... this means a lot. My sister in law passed away a year ago fighting this horrible disease, she left behind 4 young children. She was too young. Too young.
Omfggggg!?! What a fucking AMAZING SONG!! I have lost countless auntie’s, uncles, and even many more cousins to cancer and all its different forms. This song truly hit me hard and made me cry! 😭😭 I’m adding this song to my healing vibes playlist! (A playlist I created on Spotify of 13 hours worth of music that helps me get through the tough times! Thanks so much, TOM!  🙏🏼❤️
Damn
I needed to hear that, thanks man. God bless everyone.
That made me tear up. Great song ❤
Annyone else get that bnha ad at the beginning
* chefs kiss *
Man usually Tom doesn't make me cry but damn that hit me hard
Absolutely love it!
Thank you tom
DAMN......THIS HIT
Not going to lie man, this song hits hard. Never had a song bring me to tears before but you spoke the truth and this song just forced the water works. Thanks for everything you do Tom!
2x surviver! Thank you Tom!
Lost a friend before he turned 31 and I've got 2 aunt's who don't have to buy bras anymore. Cancer sucks!
Thanks for this Song......we lost the dad from my wife and we fight whit him day by day.....we lost Him but we know he love us for ever
Love this song! My wife 48 years old had colon cancer last year. It was the hardest time of my family’s life. The chemo caused heart problems but as of right now she’s doing well!
Thank you. Just thank you Tom.
I know you may not see this. But thank you for this song. My grandfather lost he's battle with type 4 lung cancer. And my friends mother is going through it now. It's crazy cancer patients has to have a lot of money in order to even see the "best doctors" and then there's no guarantees they will live through it. Cancer patients shouldn't have to pay a damn thing for medical bills or wigs but they have too. And I know for a fact they have a cure out there for everything. They just don't want to loose money to put it out. Much love and respect for this song. Thank you.
Man this song really touched me this shit was deep in my fam. I needed this song thanks man
This hits too close. Lost my 15 yr old granddaughter 6 yrs ago to childhood cancer and a sister 5 days ago. Pain is unbearable.
I have lost many people to cancer and I can honestly say I don’t want to know if I ever get it
RIP EVH
Thanks Tom!
Wow thought about my uncle during this
I lost 2 of the most important people to me to cancer hearing this song truly struck a chord with me and had me in tears. This is the pain and suffering that my family and I went through. This is truly something special.
Thank you so much for this song Tom. I lost my Nana to breast cancer and bone cancer 6yrs ago next month and this song has touched my heart so much it brought up feelings I forgot I had ♥️😢😭♥️  Keep doing what you do and thank you again for your music
Damn Tom 😪 Thanks for being real
Bro, you're not a scientist, not a doctor. You don't understand what you're talking about. If they can't find a cure it means they CAN'T FIND A CURE. How all this shit works it's too complicated for average person
I've lost my step dad to stage 4 lung cancer it hurts to watch someone so health go weak in just a few months. I'm happy u made this song💖 also it did hit home😩💖 but it's a powerful message💖✨ LOVE U Tom and Nova ✨💖
Brought tears to my eyes , my grandma passed away from cancer and my mom had cancer 😭 I love the song man
I love love love this 💖
My grandma and great grandma died from cancer 5 years ago
One more day with my mom an I'll leave here too.
Great song i have seen so many people even family die from cancer thank you
2 time survivor, and I'm pretty sure it's back. This time, I'm kicking its its ass on my terms.. RSO.
Good on ya MacDonald.... this will help people... may Yeshua bless you, may you find him as well. Seems you’re not far away....
Holy fuck I just teared Up for the first Time in 2 years. Keep IT Up, you been reaching and helping a lot more people than you think.
This... This right fucking here... I lost my dad. My absolute best friend. I watched him fight for 11 long years. He watched me get married and walked his daughter down the aisle. He fought and never gave up. And then lost 3 months before he got to meet his one and only grandson.. I miss my dad more than I have words to describe. Thank you Tom from the bottom of my heart
i cried while listen to the song. in 2016, he was 65, i've lost my father from cancer. he wasn't a religious man,so my mom accepted that we just listen to 3 songs that he liked at the funeral ceremony. i really think that music connects us, wherever we are. Thank you Tom.
Great song. Thanks Nova and Tom. As someone who has lost a mother and many others to this awful disease; this song is a great reminder of their fight and the system that lies and fails daily. Kudos my man! For those still fighting, keep up the fight.
That's my mom died from the shit 3 yrs ago. Ive been saying the same shit for years bro but what can we do. It's cause only the good die to soon.
Biiiig up! Youre king!
who dislikes this is cancer^^
Anyone remember Jason Vale? Cured his second round of cancer with apricot seeds and began to sell em’ afterwards for cancer patients. FDA sued him and he got five years in prison. For using the word “cure”. System is far more crooked and rigged than most will be willing to acknowledge because it feels safer to keep their heads buried. Thank you for another truth filled video, Tom. 🖤
Thank you, Tom. Beautiful. I have lost more people than I care to remember to cancer, and every last one of them fought to the death. Much love to you, doll
Thank you so much dude. I was diagnosed with brain cancer two and a half years ago... like I beat it but it was a scaring experience that I will never forget. I don’t know the exact brain cancer I had but I know it was a rare form of cancer that legit one doctor knows all about it in Melbourne where I live. Thank you
this hit home tom thank you my new life song
I don't say much.. but today I said good bye to my grandmother because she lost her battle with cancer. What a God send for you to drop this song today Tom.
I lost my Gpa to cancer & the doctors said the treatments would help but the radiation just drained what life he had left & I hate them for that smh I watched my Gpa go from painting landscapes, sunsets, sunrises & country sides to slowly losing his mind, staring out the window waiting to make his journey to the spirit world. This video gave me a lump in my throat & tears in my eyes.
Damn dude you wasn't lying.... I did cry some... Lost my dad when I was 18 to cancer and the date they gave him was my 18th bday he told me he wouldnt let that happen and fought 3 months longer so it wasnt on my bday then a month later lost my gram then a month later my pap  then I got it when I was 25 but I was lucky to be a survivor! You have no idea what I would do to have one more conversation with my dad! Im blessed every morning i open my eyes! Love ya man! Be safe! Keep doing you!
Spoiler alert this was actually on the gravestones CD but was titled f*ck cancer
your great Tom. Keep speaking for the people!
Tear jerker this song hit so close to home xoxo thank you for your music
Having watched cancer put an early end to both my parents lives this one really resonates with me.
I have no words. Just keep watching on repeat 💛
Infowars.com infowars.com infowars.com
Your music never disappoints me bro keep it going keep that fire going man May God bless you and nova for everything you do for us as far as the messages on everything deep up never change
Tom I just want you to know not every Christian is the annoying type that will annoy you about you about using marijuana. Some Christians have been born again and see with the sight of the Lord. Tom Jesus Christ is love. I can see his mighty hand in these words. What are you doing is right carry-on!!!
Man i just lost my job this really means alot is so many ways! Thank you Tom!
The doctors used my grandpas last wife as a test subject when she got cancer her hospital file looked like the secret service had ahold of it 3/4 of her records  were blacked completely out
✌️❤️💯🇺🇸✊
Bro, you are awesome.  Songs with meaning and perspective, thank you. Hope to meet you one day, think it your view could be enlightening
Awesome song man! Keep doing what your doing. Your music speaks volumes! You are one of the very few artist with a positive message or anything real to say at all.
Been Fighting every day for the past 2 years. Can't feel my hands, can't feel legs from my knees down. I struggle to pay for the treatments and scans.
Love you Tom - I know where we all go - to God - it won’t be easy when he shows us what we did to others but he loves us - we go to him - you will too
Thanks Tom. Great song. In tears bud.
Your winning.
Tom has a new song every week, he is working hard and I love it !
I didn’t believe his post about this song and now here I am crying❤️thank you tom!!
The truth
I honestly hope you get a lot bigger than even you can imagine, you have such a good choice of topics to write music about and you seem like it’s a near and dear issue with everything you sing about. You’re great at what you do and keep on keepin on, great song as always
The emotion you put in this song feels like this is something very personal to you. It’s nice to find something genuine for a change.
This one hit me really hard bro lost my mom two years ago still hurts so much 🙏🏻
This song will help alot of people deal with this situation n for that thank you for making this song.  You truely are a great artists. Another song that hit the feels.

Ive seen some young women and men fight cancer and win.
Another true, strong, emotional message! Just lost my momma July 2nd 2020 to lung cancer, killed her in 1 month, had to take her off life support.. It's hard.. thank you Tom!
Wow this is amazing the song hits home for everyone.  The video is spot on thank you I can't stop watching

Tom thank you for the song I I’m a cancer survivor myself and even though the song is a hard one for me to hear and I’m crying as I write this thank you thank you for your music keep doing what you do you’re the best
Thank you for bringing words to a very difficult topic. #TomMacdonald #hangovergang #HOGFAMILY
Unfortunately my mother already had two but besides that the cure is worse than the disease, it is fine now, but my father died 4 months ago with cancer or better with 3 stomach, lungs and liver cancers, it was  very bad See him disappearing day by day, it's a diabolical disease, my father took me, walks behind my mother, I have two .Colleagues who are practically waiting for death, apart from the k have also left, I have cases that they knew at the beginning of the month and by the end of the month they will not be here 😔 much strength for the warriors of .everyone in the world ❤️💪
I lost a really close friend last year to cancer, he fought it for 4 years, rest easy joe  <3
Let's find the Cause... To hell with thier" cure"
And who says rappers have to sing about drugs guns and money  Bitch no this was an amazing and powerful song and this is why I’m a huge fan  He takes real life things and makes them into an amazing song ❤️❤️ much appreciation
Hit me in the feels but I like it
This is amazing
Where we go one we go all. You speak the #truth you are a blessing. We have a purpose here on Earth. I know what mine is and you are living yours. Thank you 💗 thank God
You are such a awsome artist!! Have lost alot of family and friends to cancer and what you write is true keep being you and spitting that truth out in this corrupt world we live in!!!! ❤❤
Tom...I wish you the best
Keep making real music that means something. I love it. Sad and happy at the same time. That is life!
I just lost my wife of 35 years. She battled for 2 years first breast cancer, then to the brain then down to her spin and finally to her liver. She is the strongest woman I know, and the pain I feel right now seems like it will never go away!
Beautiful message. Well said Tom. Thank you. From a cancer survivor.
Not going to lie... my eyes were leaking on this one.  I'm a stage 3 colon/rectal cancer survivor.   I'm now 47 was diagnosed when i was 45 ... so I'm young with no family history of this.  When you look at the "stats" for stage 3 they say only 40% make it past 5 years.... I'm trying to be one of the 40.  I also lost a few friends this year from cancer.. 2 were diagnosed last year.  I am humbled all the time knowing how lucky I am.  I wouldn't be here without God putting all the talented nurses and doctors in my path.  The doctor didn't think I had a week left based on the blockage it caused.    #fightthegoodfight #nevergiveup
This was special right here bud, man this effects everyone .keep these coming bro your igniting a fire and your calling is stong
"we're dying to keep living!" Bro!!! I'm leaking
Listened to it three times and decided to quit smoking cigarettes
a family friend died of leukemia in 2013
I went through stage three cancer for a year and it’s the worst experience I have ever been through. I wasn’t afraid to Die. I know where I’m going after. I was at peace with my heart and my God for he has plans for all of us. A lot of people were freaked out to hear me say that but I know Gods love and peace and that’s what kept me through. Thank you for this song Tommy 💯❤️
Thank you for this my grandfather has cancer and I live with him and cherish every  day
WE ALL SAY THE SAME THINGS ... THE REAL PROBLEM IS LISTENING.  ONE DAY.
If there's a cure its not the hospitals fault, it's the FDA or even higher up where the answer lies. The hospitals  are just vehicles for the FDA and Big Pharma. Most doctors, nurses, and Pharmacists are just doing their best to save a life when it comes through the door.
I’ve been saying this for many years
Love and miss i grandma I have end stage kidney failure and im still fighting
I’d been actually dealing with the lost of aunt because of cancer February will be two years, but I lost my mom when o was 10 and I always turn to you Tom legit you keep me moving each day with you’re words. I’m proud to say I listen to you’re music, this song is amazing and hope you keep doing what you do best
Tragic to witness
Thank you so much for this <3 i just finished my radiation treatment for the tumor i have in my neck. now the healing has to start. because the treatment gave my mouth sores so i can eat. i cant speak and even have difficulty getting liquids in somedays. but i am a fighter!!!! will only get better from there. my tumor has shrunk so much doctor seems very happy with how much. now they can operate and remove it.
Tom man just to be honest m not fan but this is something that holds a lot of substance so thank you.
Fuck, this hits me in the feels bro. Lost my mom over a decade ago to cancer
I don’t ever post things on my Facebook page, but I couldn’t help but share this. Honestly Tom? God bless you.
Love bro nothing but love from me And yours homie.
The 210 people that gave this song a thumbs down are pieces of shit cuz the message of this song is amazing and so true. Again Amazing song!
You have such a good heart Tom❤️❤️❤️
I thank you again ..
I’ve lost 4 family members to this including my mother and grandfather. I have your albums so I have heard this song many time but...You made me go into the ugly cry with this video.
Hey man thank you for this my uncle has it and not looking good for him
March 23rd 2017 my mother died in my arms at the age of 53 from a tumor we knew she had for less than a week. Died in my arms in the same hospital wing she gave birth to me in. Every day it hurts. Nothing changes
Excellent
Omg tom thx for this video you help millions and millions.I dont have cancer but it must be really hard
You won't hear mainstream artists talking about things like this in their songs. Tom Macdonald got the game on lockdown! Peace and Blessings to all who are fighting the fight with Cancer or knows someone going through it 💯❤
Man this hit hard.  Grandpa just passed after 6yrs of fighting cancer    It’s true you don’t know what you can do until the pressure is put on you and you face challenges every step of the way
Cancer took my father my grandfather my godfather. shortly after my dad died I found out there are several cures for cancer that big pharma will not let the public believe.
As a survivor and former cancer patient. I would like to thank you for this song, man.   It's truly going to help a lot of people get through one hell of a tough time.
Love it! I have M.S. not Cancer but the struggles are similar. Thanks you for being you!
Thank bro.. I had the fight for around 10yrs ago.. And I Only pray for other ppl Who are fighting a Hard fight right now..  Keep fightig. You are strong. And you will beat it.. 🙏🙏
My grandpa died of stomach cancer last year. This hits different. Thank you Tom!
Can't believe people say this guy's corny      He's like the only rapper rn who cares about every problem in the world
Good stuff
Whos cutting onions!? Damn this one hit close to home.
Awesome song!!! I've wondered that same thing myself. How is so much research being done but little progress. Yet when they push an issue like this Covid crap they can make a vaccine and find things that help in a matter weeks and months.
Thank you for speaking 💯 this is some real shit right here!! God bless bro keep doing your thing man!!!
My story is too long to tell my friend.. you give me hope
I didn't even finish the story he posted I came straight here 🖤🌟💫
My mom recently got diagnosed with cancer. This really hit home. It’s really encouraging to see someone you look up to and admire make such a powerful video. Thank you Tom!
Crying on my lunch break at work. This came across my autoplay. My boyfriends dad was just diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer last week. The holidays this year will have such a dark cloud over them. Thank you Tom for this song today we needed it.
Damnit man...straight sad facts. Many tars rolled for my past friends that i lost and current friends that are goin through it now.
Look up  (The forbidden Cure on youtube) there are several cures for cancer, but big pharma can't make money off of that so they run everyone that comes out with one out of the country and discredit them!
My close friend died of cancer in April so this hit me hard...
I love this song bro! All of your songs are so lit man
Very touching video Tom we love it... Damn man this hits really hard man Idk what else to say but thank you for this wish it was made sooner but its great to hear it now regardless.
This is a super impactful song and truly hits home on many levels. I have personally seen the effects of this demon called Cancer and its horrifying. Thank you for making this song @Tom MacDonald. You are truly awesome and wholesome.
Steady dropping fire
***THANK YOU TOM****            I REALLY NEEDED TO HEAR THIS TODAY!
Nice to See Someone Rapping About Real Stuff. Keep it 100
They can make a cure for the coronavirus but not the cure for cancer
My Aunt got Breast Cancer. She's a fighter because she fought it & beat it! Now, I got the news that my Dad might have Cancer😭
#trending
I am 16 and i got 4th grade varicocele (dialated vein) in my left side (it swells scrotum and causes pain and discomfort) it's only treatment is surgery. I'll be getting surgery done soon. Will keep y'all updated. I slept with earpod in my right ear woke up with dead right ear hair cells (in short, permanent hearing loss in right ear) let me repeat again i am 16. These traumas made me stop uploading to my youtube channel which has been my dream ever since i got phone in my hands its been 5 years to that. I am mentally getting better and accepting it.
I'm not crying ! Your crying !!!
My aunt is in her last days of her battle. Yesterday she told everyone she was ready to go. My girlfriend's dad passed from it. Seems there is more to be made from the treatment and not the cure.
We need to get this trending
thank you for being back all the good memories i had with my grandfather thank you tom
Awesome song
this hit way to hard man fuck its and amazing song but fuck man
I'm dont understand the down votes.
Thank u for making this song i wish u would have made this nine years ago when my grams died it would have been the perfect song for her funeral  she refused the radiation treatment cus in her words i new what i was in for as im the one that did this to myself and she suffered  hard at the end
You are an awesome person Tom...one of my buddies mom has cancer...I showed him this song and he said it really touched him...keep sticking to what the rap community has been missing for a while....a message. Thank you again!
Fucking love this it is very powerful untruthful song
Hell yea this isn't jus about cancer,all those who understand it's about life Respect Tom
We love you Tom. You’re such a great person and make amazing music that always has a message and helps people

I like the line about faith
my cousin worked as a bio engineer for ici chemicals back in 1985 till 1989 and he said back then they have the rna dna restrutureing program to build 97,8 percent cures for cancers ,and that was back in 1988,he was angry about it not being rolled out to be tested,he was sacked in 1989 due to is very vocal stance ,18 mnths later he got testitcler cancer and died in 1991,the common cold virus stripped of its basic base structure and cancer markers put in its place the common cold virus attacks that cancer cells and kills them multiplying to kill all cancer markers,great song tom
Great song!
My great-grandma, my grandpa, and my grandpas sister died from cancer... My grandpa didn't take treatment because he was already in stage 4 and he watched his mom and sister go through hell to fight a losing battle. My aunt had breast cancer and won but there's always a chance for it to come back. I am so greatful for everyone in my life! Tom and Nova always killing it! Thank you guys so much for changing my life!!!
Bro 💖♥️💙💚💛💜🖤💘
Sidenote: would you ever do a song on child/human trafficking? I would give anything to see you rap the truth about that.
My wife just beat stage 3C cervical cancer. I don't know if our marriage survived it though. I still love you tho Mattie Anne. ❤️🖤❤️🖤. Thanks Tombo.
Thank you for this Tom. You got me in tears. That you dropped this on today of all days hit me hard. My Aunt who helped raise me struggled for years with cancer. I was only a kid at the time but I was there with her going to her chemo, when she was rushed to the emergency room, and when she needed help even to bathe. We lost her 20yrs ago on Sweetest Day. Much love to you for speaking out on this subject.
This really hit home because heart cancer runs in my family. Update and this is not a joke. I got told that my Stage 3 G. E. R. D. Can become cancer.💔😭
Damn man. 100% truth  Hit me in the feels!!
My aunt has survived colon cancer twice once at 21 and second time at 42 and the chemo and radiation from the second time did more damage and caused her more problems that  she still deals with to this day
my Mom has a brain tumor......this song helps a little
Powerful! Brought me to tears 💞
Man this hit home hard. My step mother is a two time breast cancer survivor. Thank you Tom, this was fire.
Lost my paternal grandmother to cancer about 10 or so years ago now, I forget how long exactly. It was second bout of it. First time it started in her ovaries, but she fought that like a champ. Then a couple years later it came back in her breasts. She fought bravely still, but I guess it was just her time. My sister and I saw her in the hospital a week or so before she passed. But that frail, gaunt figure isn't the version of her that I want to remember. All these years later and it still hurts. But at least I can and do take solace in knowing that she's no longer in pain.
Diagnosed 2019. Appreciate the fact that  your songs actually have meaning. Keep being you man.
Thank you for this Tom! My sister is a cancer survivor.  But she is a phone call away to see if it has come back.
thanks tom this means a lot.  my wife battled cancer and won. she’s my hero. i wish everyone blessings that struggle through this🖤🖤❤️ sending love from SLC UT
Thank you for this. I lost my gram on 1/16/18 to cml leukemia still having a hard time getting over it cause she was also like my mom. Fuck cancer and I hope one day there's a cure for it
It's actually population control. Ask Bill Gates and the Democratic party with plan parenthood! IT'S TIME TO GET AN EDUCATION AND FIGHT BACK!
Hey Tom I'm cowboy or josh whatever but my mom passed this last September 7 and she was the fiery  bitch i ever met terminal cancer attacked her so fast and I just bottle it because I'm a father but loosing my mommy really fucked up my head and your song really made it worse but you letting me face some feelings I just mumble and couldnt even really feel under control thanks buddy HMU cowboyupjd247@gmail.com
I lost my adoptive father when I was 9 I’m 15 now I’ve been pissed at the doctors at god at myself at anything and everything I can blame just so I could take my anger out on something I can’t count how many times I’ve punched my wall with tears running down my face screaming “why” he actually loved me my adoptive mom had been abusive my whole life and it seemed as if she didn’t care after he died I didn’t think I’d talk about this but I lost my girlfriend to cancer as well we started dating in 6th grade I lost her almost a year ago nothing has been the same I wake up wondering why it was her and not me she was going places I loved her more than anything I still do and I’m honored I got to be a part of that journey even if she never got to finish it i have a mural covering my whole wall that she made she’s still the greatest artist I know I never had the heart to cover it up I still have the ring I meant to give her for Christmas not as a gift but as a promise it’s hard losing someone like that don’t get me wrong she pissed me tf off and we argued a lot but I loved her it’s just you don’t realize how much those arguments mean every disagreement I fell more and more in love with her just something for everybody to note if he or she whomever you may love is perfect and truly agrees with everything you say and do not even the slightest thing annoys them they’re not the one for you and I mean truly never gets upset with you it’s ok to be afraid to argue but just know that won’t last forever so don’t take this advice and immediately leave them ask them what they really think give them a chance I’m sorry to say it and you don’t have to agree with me but it’s true I don’t need or want any apologies in the replies I’m not looking for anybody to feel sorry for me I just finally decided it was time to share my story thank you Tom for everything
their good quarterly profits depend on OUR bad health  you do the math ..................................
This was Great Bro!!! I hope this song will help so many!  🔥
If your song makes doctors release a cure im going to be amazed
I didnt have ugly cry written into my schedule for 1:00pm but here you are tom, posting the real shit. Ughh my fucking heart dude. Keep up your real shit Tom.
Tom this is your best song ever beautifully poignant ❤🇮🇪
Billion dollar industries will go down kicking and screaming and don't care how many of us they take with them....cancer, opioid addiction, alcoholism, etc etc etc... $$$$
Cancer cure is here, it's just not perfect yet: https://youtu.be/UZpHu0gl6LU
Love this song so much, glad to see the video for it. Thanks bro. ❤️❤️
My grandmother had cancer 3 times and it was hard seeing her drained from chemotherapy, but she's now cancer free🙏
I love you bro
How can so many ppl dislike a song about helping n giving ppl hope? Yall dis likers are wild SMH yall sad
If cancer was curable we wouldn't have billionaires dying from it, the truth is cancer is a word we associate with the collections of cells that grow uncontrollably and those can have multiple causes, even if we find a cure it won't be good for all types of cancer because they're different.
Your amazing bro. Your songs always hit the right times 🤙🏻✊🏻🤘🏻
This one brought out the tears Tom. Amazing track, bravo.
November 24th will mark two years since my mom died of cancer. My mind is fucked up watching her die. I'm the one who found her dead. It never gets easier. I've had many mental breakdowns because I didn't know how to deal with it.
Just over here sobbing. Don’t mind me. Thank you Tom. 🙏🏻
Had to listen to it twice in a row
The cure for cancer has been made but the cure to cancer is patent so no other medical company can sell the cure or give it to a patient and the cure is SALICYLIC ACID eat more food with this acid and u won’t get cancer
As someone who has leukemia i thank you for making this. It cheered me up and made me in a better mood today. Thank you Tom
Yes! 🙏💟 Keep the music coming! You always hit home for me and my family!
Thank you, Tom. I lost a great friend to cancer over the summer. He was a retired NYPD, First responder on that fateful day, as well as a veteran. He was #6 of his fellow brothers to pass from the same cancer they developed because of that day.
How, your timing is divine,my grandad just passed from cancer 6 days ago, this speaks to me, thank you.
🙏🙏🙏🙏amazing song
Damn Bro!!!! This hits hard for so many. This is just proof of your rise, the messages are clear and as long as you continue in the direction of your hearts songs you will continue to rise and succeed. Thank you!!!
Good job Trump is massively reducing the cost of drugs.
When you're healthy, you have a million problems.  When yer sick, you have just one.  Good song, bro.
Wild lettuce,  mugwart, amanita muscaria,  marihuanna only cures if you aren't a chronic.  Cancer is caused from bitterness cheer up please
Lost my dad to cancer 11 yrs ago miss him like everyday thank you bro this one got me good
Cancer is the real pandemic
I found out about 6 months back that one of my old best friends got cancer. He's still going through his procedures. I also found out a couple years back that my Aunt got cancer. For a while after treatment she started feeling a lot better and then everything took a turn for the worst. The cancer came back swinging. A couple months back she was given the time frame of only a couple months left to live. The part that kills me is seeing my Mom physically watching her sister slowly pass in front of her. On top of that hearing that my Aunt is planning her own funeral. Nobody should ever have to plan their own funeral. Especially being this young (late 40s). Sometimes I wonder if there is or isn't a cure. I mostly wonder where we go after this life. I've always grown up religious, but there's always been a part of me that was skeptical of whether or not there's a higher being or if we just mindlessly drift in an open abyss. Hopefully I never see the same fate as many of my relatives that have passed from cancer, suicide or addiction.
I have a cousin with cancer currently and have lost a grandfather and an adopted father to cancer. This hit hard but thank you Tom. Another great one♥️
Thank you for this one. Lost my fishing buddy(dad) last year to Brain Cancer.
It's home brother. My grandmother is a breast cancer survivor. But my father in law was not so lucky with his bone cancer. Best song ever. Much love Tom.
My uncle has cancer for the second time and had to have a kidney removed, and his hip replaced. All because of cancer. It’s been years, and he still has it...
What's the bet Tom gets a, Hollywood woke letter and is given a choice
My mom died from stage 4 cancer literally a month ago, I wish this song was made before then so I can have her listen to it 😢
Whew made me cry, so good! ❤And really applicable to a lot of struggles.
Never expect less from this man!!!! When he drops a song it always hits close to home weather you want to hear it or not.
3 years and 2 weeks. Lost my best friend to bone marrow cancer. Miss my bro everyday. Till we see each other again. Miss you Rob.
From 🇧🇬 Bulgaria Tom, my fella be blessed 🙏😇💋❤️🎊💐💐💐💐💐💐
Great song Tom.had cancer when I was 15 years old,I'm 44 now.never claimed I was a Survivor but I sure as hell am a fighter.thanks Tom.....
Thank you for your voice 🥺 God bless you and your family 😍
I just lost my mom this august to cancer. This had me in tears. I wish she could have heard this. Thanks Tom for making this song!!!
When I say this is why I love ur music. Just know that this is way more then “just music” this is a message, a beacon of hope, a ray of sunshine.
One of the questions is. Can you make folks feel what you feel in side? Yes my friend you can.  Good job
Thank you for making a song like this i lost my dad to cancer the music industry needed  someone like you so bad
Hang over gang forever! I love this one, I like how it really capitalizes on the cancer. I wrote a spoken word about cancer.. Well it was more like a rap, and I didn't have much faith in myself back then to rap; but I am doing things outside my comfort zone every day, trying to push myself! Anyways.. Another good one! I am glad I am a fan!   Peace brother! Your my fam!
Another amazing one. I have no words to Express how grateful I am for this song. My grandmother lost her fight in 1999. Didnt even see the century pass over, didnt get to see Christmas. She was such a strong woman, and fought till the end. This makes me smile through the tears though, because she lives on through hope. To anyone struggling with cancer, keep pushing. Your family Has your back, they love you. You are important, and you can survive. I love y'all. Be blessed.
I'm actually going through this my uncle has cancer stage 4 and the doctors just said that he's won't make and they've given up on him now
Tom thank you for this. This song and these lyrics are extremely powerful. You are an amazing rapper, singer, and lyricist. #hangovergangforlife
much love... to all that are fighting the fight ... #staystrong #fuckcancer
Goddamn it bro. That shit hit like a hammer. I lost my mom and dad to cancer. Keep doing it man.
This one hits close to home Tom. Thank you for all that you do.
wow Brother!!! after going through 2 strokes that changed my life forever this hits so close to home..may not be cancer but we all know its a death sentance eventually the big one will hit...powerful song Tom Thank you for it!
K
my best friend died from cancer...she would appreciate this
This hits hard because my grandma just beat cancer last year
Cancer is a hereditary thing I'm my family (my sister, grandmother, grandfather, and aunt all in remission) so I really enjoyed this one. Thanks Tom
Tom, this is moving brother. Keep making your music. I love all your songs because they have meaning. Fuck record labels and censorship. 🖕🏻🖕🏻 The shit you make is real. This brings inspiration to all. Much love and respect bro. Lol btw Ive turned a few ppl in the military on to your music.
My mom is currently battling Metastatic Breast Cancer... So thank you for this 1 bro!           #F@$%CANCER

Thank you Tom for giving the truth in all your songs💖
Lost my Big Brother, Mentor, Best Friend July 2 2020. He fought through Esophageal Cancer in 2018 lost about 100lbs from a tumor blocking his food passing. They removed the tumor he beat it, only for a rapid growing tumor to appear in his brain they said they got it all April 2019, February 2020 Cancer showed its face again in his brain fluid and moved down his spine he fought so hard.   My Dad pass in 2010 of lung and brain cancer and my Daughter lost her first Love in 2017 to brain Cancer as well. They have all taken apart of my soul with them.  May they Rest In Peace for the end of their Journey here on earth was very painful.. “Gone But Not forgotten”  see you all sometime soon #findthecure
It kinda sounds like jacksepticeye it singing to during the chorus
Love you dawg for real... You living my dream ..shit like this is real music... Speaking words to touch someone in the right way... Dont go perverted...lmap
Thank you, I feel the truth. God bless.
Damn...so im not addicted to cigarettes...but i feel like listening to this song makes me wanna just quit. And this is my 3rd time listening to it
I can't even read the comments.  This is why I try not to complain. Bc Ik there's people way worse off than me. My gfs dad had cancer. They removed his large intestines (Colin) his liver in his pancreas and they say as of now they got it all. But you never know. That's why they told him he's gotta come back once a year to make sure none came back.
My mom had cancer when I was in high school thankfully it was a type of cancer that can be cured she's been cancer free for over 5 years now and is considered cured by her doctors
my cus has cancer  he is 3
How heartless do you have to be to dislike this video?? 😖
Me dad has been diagnosed with cancer twice this year... Hell think this song is amazing
oh wow this song is so powerful, I've lost 4 family member's to cancer in various forms, this song is to real thanks Tom for putting this out. My grandmother beat it 4 times until she was to weak to fight it off for the 5th time due to the environment she worked in( Textile Industry)
Cancer took my Mom and Dad and its chewing on my oldest Brother right now! Cancer is relentless!
Nothing matters if you don't have your health all the money in the world doesn't help!
This is so touching
Deep message Tom keeping it real as always 🤘🏻💀🤘🏻
Shit, felt this.
Atleast you'll speak the truth. Mainstream won't talk about any of this. Thank you and nova for what yall do HOG
Tom, another message for the world to hold onto, what you do is amazing. Your music has more message in it than anything in the world right now. Thank you. -Truth
i don’t care if you love toms music or hate it,... not sure how anyone could hate on this track!
One year NED  from ACC 🤙  My cancer is rare enough I don't get a ribbon or qualify for many scholarships but public support is always uplifting
shared...
Great song tom keep up the with those fire tracks 100
Once "You don't know how to be brave.." starts I started pouring, man. I got diagnosed with Stage 4 Cancer from a Wilms Tumor about 2 weeks after my 8th Birthday, being Cancer free ever since, for 21 years, just a few months ago I went to the E.R and was told the found 2 masses. For about 2 weeks I was living with the reality that I could possibly have cancer again, I was haunted by it. Thank God it turned out one was trapped fluid and the other, though a Tumor (I go to get it removed on the 22nd) it is benign. Songs like this and artists like you mean so much to me.. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, Tom. God bless you, Brother 💖
I don't have cancer but I do have crohns disease which has no cure either. I relate to this song so fucking much. and it geta really really hard some days and I really needed to hear this today. thank you. HOG4LIFE
♥️ thank you having some survivers here in the family, you told it like it really is!
I literally just got home from the treatment center. I was up all night sick and haven't slept. Late stage, inoperable cancer of my venacava, lymphnodes and adrenal glands here. This has me in tears. 35 rounds of daily radiation treatments, months of chemo and immunotherapy infusions. I don't feel strong at all. Everyone around me is in denial; and when I try to talk about it, I get told that I'm not being positive and that I shouldn't be so negative about it all. When I'm just being realistic about it and the well known outcome of my diagnosis. I couldn't deal with the hair loss anymore, so I went and got a Tom MacDonald hair cut....buzzed the sides and back completely off and left the top to braid. I figured it'd be less of a shock to still have my bangs and some hair on top...and well the Viking braids kinda look cool...💇🏼‍♀️ They cancelled the support groups at the treatment center due to Covid, so I have no one to talk to who understands. I'm only 48 and I'm having to make funeral arrangements for myself and get my crap in order. Each day is literally living on borrowed time. It's like I'm watching my world crumble around me in slow motion and there's nothing I can do to stop it. The sleepless nights are the worst...constant puking from the severity of the pain and the anxiety of knowing my time is being cut short. It's wrecked me financially, physically, emotionally;  but each day I try. It's a good day if I can manage to get a shower and dressed. Most of my time is spent in bed, or the bathroom getting sick. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. Sorry for the rambling comment. This just really resonates with me and what I've been going through. *Sigh*  Edited for brain fog and fumble fingers.
I had a couple of family who had cancer this year and they died but they tried to stay here with me in the most loved place earth with me but they just failed but there here with me in my heart and there being taken care of in heaven but I know they visit me all the time this is the best song Tom thanks stay healthy stay strong and say no to drugs please I hope everyone out there is having a wonderful day I love all of you😭😢😇👏❤️❤️ Stay nice and humble!😌
Holy crap i am in tears my friend for 19 years just died mon from cancer my dad my grandfather and 5 other of my friends have died from cancer wow what a song oh rip my friend mark
I’m not crying... you’re crying. Thank you again Tom. 🖤 stay strong fam.
Yo this is amazing. Just found out my little cuz has cancer just 2 days ago and then you come out with this. Hits differently for sure. Keep up the work Tom. Much love
Amazing thats all you can say
this is astronomically important to the world right now. thank you tom.
Do you know how many people cried today hearing this? The # is probably unimaginable
hey tom, i just want to say you are in my opinion the best rapper in the world.  For real, this is not some biased opinion from a crazed out fan. I'm not even a die hard fan to be honest. Even more weird, i normally don't like rap. In my opinion, the beats are simple and repeatitive, the average lyrics of today are about how tough one is. Sure there are some great rappers who tell great stories.   The key difference tho is that they tell their own stories, tom on the other hand. has a talent i've never seen before. Tom can tell stories perfectly on behalve on people who can't tell themselves.  Tom can make a line relatable eventough we didn't know it was relatable before.  Thanks Tom, Keep going!
Musically another amazing song. The message like always hits deep but this one might have hit the deepest. I am sitting in my car almost in tears yet smiling and feel everyword in my chest. My family has battle cancer a lot and just really needed this pick me up today. Thank you Tom and Nova and anyone else who helped create this masterpiece.
I watched my pawpaw go through it. They told my granny he wouldn't have enough insides left to survive after chemo, but that was his ONLY OPTION. She d idnt want to lose him so they opted to do it. I watched as he coughed up what was left and he slowly died. He d idnt know what was going on at that point. I miss him every day and all I can think about is he could still be here. Thank you for your music Tom, you do us a great service.
Lost my mom to cancer a month ago.
Wow this song is truly amazing.. I love you Tom MacDonald and Nova Rockefeller..
Tom and Nova Thank you! ALL LOVE
Og fans will notice his teach became a doctor
THE MOST OBVIOUS IS THE LEAST OBVIOUS TO IGNORANCE AND GULLIBILITY...PFFT! Keep spitting the truth....even if fallen on deaf ears. Cheers/ peace
FACTS
Hey buddy, Gene Greenwood here. After 27 operations and being terminal for the 3rd time, this song resonates with me in many ways. No idea what the future holds ahead, but being in this space of life is very different from before Cancer. Everyday is a fight for a new 1440 minutes. Live the 1440 and help others, thanks for the video and song
Another wonderful one Tom! Glad to see another meaningful song that is well done. Keep it up you're helping a lot of people out there with this quality music.
27 years old and currently fighting stage 4 colon cancer, and I have a wife and a son. Thanks for making this song and I hope it helps others fighting this disease.
Great song!
The people that dislike this video are horrible human beans!! The greatest blessings in this life is health and ❤️
Love you man 💗
Everything you rap about this song is so freaking true. Its about time an artirst gets real about cancer. Keep up the amazing work you do. Tom you freaking rock on!
This is awesome.My husband's family has been hit by cancer a few times and I try my best to help him deal with the lose it causes.
How crazy.. I just found out about 12 hours ago my uncle a man who’s been like a father to me was diagnosed with leukemia... thank you Tom 🙏
Thanks Tom and Nova!
I have loved every song and everything about Tom Macdonald. After this one, I love him even more. My 3 year old son finished treatment for stage 4 high risk cancer in February. This song has so much meaning for us💜
Absolutely love this song took 3:40 minutes to describe what most people go through daily . Sending love from Ontario Canada 🇨🇦
Love the song bro it kinda hit close to home because I love my brother to cancer in 2016 keep up the great work happy for you
Thank you Tom and your crew for speaking TRUTH and using your talents to inspire awareness and positive change! God bless you all!
This is sad but true. Tell it brother.
Just hearing this will give some more power to fight
Thank you for making me feel better! 14 months misdiagnosed as mental health issues. Only 4 cases in Australia 78 cases in the world! 25 have survived and I was the youngest in the world aged 21. I'm so glad I had my daughter's before I had a emergency hysterectomy and was told that I had 5% chance. My tattoo is sign of life
2 years cancer free.. Thank you for this amazing song...
Wee done! I pray this reaches all who need that extra support and encouragement they may need to lift  their spirits..
chemo therapy is an attempt to break down the chemical in your body killing you but whatever. now ill admit that not looked  at correctly on every attempt, but is close to what should be done you have chemically break down the chemical density that causes your sickness. not always looked at that manner.
AWESOME!! 🙌🏽🙏🏽  We've personally lost many family/friends to these globalists tyrants profitable cancers and treatments🤬  And how sick and sad there's even ANY thumbs down on YouTube (very small number btw) WTF is wrong with people!!? OH I KNOW, they're MAINSTREAM TV/MEDIA DRIVEN EGO OR PAID OFF TROLL SHIT is trying to spread like their masters cancer all over this TRUTH!!   HUGE THANK YOU FOR ALL of Tom MacDonald's & FAMILY's HARD WORK ✊🏻✊🏽✊🏿 These global tyrants in control/trying to take over our world are nothing but COWARDS🖕🏽  THE WORLD WAKES 🙌🏽
I lost my mother to cancer and I just learned yesterday that my auntie back in Hawaii has cancer. Thank you for this!
Tom you just reached through my phone grabbed me by the shirt and slapped me in the face with this one 🤘🤘🤘🤘
Hell of a way to spread the message . Kudos
100% true
Firstly brilliant video and meaning (for those that think there can just cure it) there's so many strain's of cancer it's hard to cure every strain ✌️
If you can't see that tom is in pain while shooting this video then i don't know what kind of human are you
As prolific as any writer in generation!! Pac level surpassed!!
Thanks Tom! I can really appreciate this song, especially right now... I just lost my father inlaw to cancer 5 weeks ago from today... And it has been a really tough road for my wife. I'm sure she will appreciate this song as much as I do.
This song hits me so hard thank you
Who are the 43 people that don't like this?   This is personal to me.  Who doesn't know someone who has lost or currently has cancer.  I lost my Dad he had cancer.
Wow. Just... wow. My opinion is that this is the most important and impactful track I've heard from Tom. Not that my opinion matters, but absolutely stunning.
Damn. Bro this song was just. Amazing.
Tom you make me a prouder Canadian bro!! Eastcoast shootout to you..Represent!!
This one has hit home respect for making this song I've lost a grandfather and a bunch of cousins to it
The ppl disliked are the ones who are in denial of their reality!!! Be kind to one another you dont know what someone's going through!!!!
Thanks for that song very heartfelt!
Man this was much needed thank you tom macdonald
Boy, you weren't kidding when you said in your YT story this would make us cry. My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 right between Thanksgiving and Christmas. In 2014, she had a mastectomy because she didn't think she'd survive chemo and radiation, which she would have had to do for almost a year to shrink the tumor to a small enough size for a lumpectomy. She also had another surgery a month later because a lymph node was removed in the first surgery and it tested positive for cancer. Thankfully, no other lymph nodes that were removed during the second surgery did.  Things aren't great between us (my mom and I) right now, but I still love her, and remember the night she got the call that her tumor was cancerous. She and I cried harder than we did when my grandmother (maternal mom) died.
Thanks Tom. This hits home big time!
😢
My Momma said Thank you 💯🔥  SURVIVOR. Had cancer 4 times. "HAD"
Both my parents have cancer there in there 70s but it still hurts my heart. I cant tell you how much youve made me cry on this song cause I cant imagine if my kids got it........Love you Mr. Mcdonald Thank You for this Video
Thank you a lot for the song... my father hass cancer in his lungs This song helps me alot to have hope
Thank you Tom. Ive watched not one but two people take their last breaths in front of me from cancer. Never has felt acknowledged but this song helped
You know more than you should. Bet we could talk for days on the secrets they hide. Wonder if you know what I know or less.
Wow Tom, thank you <3
Lost my father and little brother to cancer, too many of us have a similar story.  How many have to suffer before we as a collective stop participating in the production of the very things killing us?
🎶🔥💯🔥🎶
I know everything he’s talking about lost my son age 4 to cancer. Definitely rings family closer. RIP to everyone who’s lost there battle. It’s been 6 years and kills me everyday
Sad but Awesome Video too bad its part of life for some.
Powerful bro
TOM.   Thank you for this.  You werent lying bro.   Here at work with tears rolling down my face.   Again, thank you .  This song will inspire many to stay strong .   💪💪
Amazing as always
My mom's going through this right now she's done with radiation and kemo and has surgery the 30th. The hardest part for her and us was her losing all of her hair. She's never cut her hair in my life and had beautiful long red hair. Thanks for the song Tom.
My son had Leukemia when he was 3. He took chemo for 3 years, he’s 10 now. And I lost my Dad to colon cancer May of 2019 (hardest thing I’ve ever been through) Thank you for this Tom!!! We all needed it!! 🤧🤧🤧❤️
damn tom you weren't lyin bro, you made me cry homie, can't even finish the video
My colleague's 3 year old daughter was diagnosed with leukemia last year & it's so devastating! Thank you very much Tom & Nova for this anthem for all Cancer Patients like Naura & Cancer Survivors/Fighters everywhere! Much Respect and 🧡 from Malaysia! 💯💯
Damn this song hits home...we all know someone whom has been affected from that damn cancer..
So dope!! Great message Tom! 🖤
I’m crying 😢 so what I’m not afraid to admit it
My 5 year old son was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer last October. His bill is almost at 2 million. This has been the longest year of our lives.
Ok guys not denying that Big Pharma is FUCKED.  But realize Cancer itself is a BLANKET term. HUGE blanket term. Any cell mutation is technjically cancer, and you can get cancer of literally *anything*. And EACH of those is VASTLY different. Only the most popular cancers get all the donations (like the Susan G. Komen breast cancer foundation which is awful in and of itself).  Just droppin' some knowledge.
Hell yeah Tom 👊🏼
I lost my bestfriend the day after thanksgiving last year due to leukemia. She had tried all clinical trials except for one...the last one that was available to her and it cost $550,000, even with insurance and govt assistance it was not enough, she still could not afford it. FUCK CANCER!!!!!!!!
My 3rd cousin died this past summer with cancer. This song would’ve been awesome if she heard it. She made a wish at “Make a Wish Foundation” she got it! She went to Hawaii for a week. She was around 15 years old. I felt bad for her.
Ive been shot at, stabbed, blown up, set on fire, and run over...im not scared of much...but i have 4 kids...and they terrify me...this song represents just one of the reasons i dont sleep much...thankx tom
Damn man, always a fan, this ones just different ❤️🔥
Amazing 👏
Anyone else having problems with audio
My daughter is in her 4th year of battle... thank you ..
That was pretty powerful my man Yeah all that money trying to keep you alive and figure out cancer.    F@&k cancer
Its so good to have a rapper with skill that isn't afraid to speak on EVERYTHING. Much love and thank yous for all you do Tom.    H.O.G 4 life
If they gave out the cure then they lose all that donation money, all the money for research, all that money from the radiation treatments, MONEY they loose it so they will never release the cure to public. There is a cure for a lot of different things that people don't think about but greed kills.
What a buitifull song,chills down my spine!
“We’re dying to keep living” Another deep track, love you tom.
And the actors are great at what they do
How do you dislike this song!? the people who thumbs down this song apparently has never had anyone have cancer close to them. Tom McDonald always speaking facts keep it up man
This is gonna be in my playlist fir a long time man this song has a message and I want everyone to hear it cause it needs to be heard tbh
Thank you tom. For the amazing  song like always  you make my heart sing
BEAUTIFUL😊
I had cancer twice I didn’t care that I had it but seeing your love ones get destroyed after you tell them then I started caring. Thank you Tom McDonald keep up the good work . Love your music!!
You can just tell tom knows someone going through this...hes on the verge of tears the whole time...
Beautiful song Tom, beautiful. Inspirational brother. God bless you.
Been there done the cancer treatments for 6 months and lived my life like I do everyday. I didnt change a thing just had treatments every 3 weeks for 3 days. You can't ever give up. I just saw pics from when I went through it a few weeks ago and I looked rough but when going through it I really didn't feel bad at all.
Love how adds for hospital are popping up during the video lol Great video as always Tom!!!
No one is going to heaven or hell. Just sleeping in the ground waiting for a better world coming very soon. Don't fear death. Fear God.
Lost my dad to cancer, both my grandmothers too. My dad hurt the worst. He had 2 different insurances but certain places didn't take them at the time so they just let him fade away. One of the worst things I've ever went through. My mom still cries as do I. Fuck cancer😥
Another Fire Song and Video Tom MacDonold I always supported you and can’t wait till someone really understand your message and watch you blow up more and more everyday
Will go viral such an amazing song🤙
Stage 4 bone cancer when I was 15 now I’m a Survivor 13 years later and still fighting life, head up and proud to be alive
I lost my dad and my godmother just this year due to cancer, have my dads funeral service tomorrow. Thank you for this
Bro this fucking song hit too close to home but it was good keep up the amazing work
Man, Tom right in the feels...great Video that was sad and true yet again your music is on another level I'm a fan for life bro.
They do have a cure they just can't make any money on it.
I love this
Great song 🙏🏽🙏🏽
I'm sure there's a cure but they wont give it out because it means they would end the multi trillion dollar industry
Make a country rap song next!!!!
I lost my mother to cancer in 2010 it and this song speaks home quite a bit it’s just amazing that but we put him to not really seeing anything out of it but it’s hard not to want to try to do better just we got to step up and do it thanks Tom
When you said on your post that today's video that it will make us cry, i knew it was this song. Everytime number 13 on my cd plays i cry and it's this song. I lost my mother to breast cancer 8 years ago and it hasn't gotten any easier. I love this song and everything you write bro. Thank you Tom and Nova
Thank you for this song my father is on a 6 year battle with throat cancer and it has now moved to his lung he’s going threw chemo and radiation again 4th time the first 3 years he had 6 surgeries thank you for this song seriously

Tom, thank you for this one!
I had cancer and this is just wow like hole this is amazing
I'm at 29k likes and 5k comments lol
This song really touched me cause I myself am battling cancer thanks Tom loved the song. XOXO 😘
Lost my dog and my grandma to cancer and my other dog has it man i tried my hardest not to cry
So true! Its insanity! Thank you Tom! Another true video as they all are! Amazing video! Keep fighting y'all! Remember we are strong together!
Depress me for the weekend yay!!! . Edit: nutrition is key. Not oil based pharmaceuticals. Potassium deficiency is covid-19. End of story. Not spreadable germ.  Fear not for I am with you.
Just lost my cousin to cancer last week.. This hit hard!!
That was a great song man
Amazing song and important topic. I had a severe melanoma in my right cheek and I got diagnosed 2010, at 18 years old and I was confused. Well, I fought trough it with the help of my family and with a strong "fight back" mentality. Now 10 years later, still alive and kickin! as a father of 2 beautiful boys, 2 stepsons, 1 stepdaughter and as a husband. I'm carrying my "battle" scars with pride and knowing that someday the battle might start again or not, remembering to never give up hope. Thank you for this.
I lost both my parents to cancer, and it was brutal on them. I full on cried watching this video. We all know that there’s a cure out there and there’s a special place in hell for those that hide it. Love your work Tom. Thanks.
You tryin to make me cry? Nailed it!
Omg you just made me cry 😭 God bless you and everyone fighting this battle.  Our little cousin was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, she’s just 3 yrs old but she’s a badass She is a fighter and always has a big smile even while she’s receiving Quimo so this song touched my heart.  Thank you for always write and sing about reality and not about booty shakes like other rappers, you and your wife are amazing!
You are fuckin awesome man!
Where’s the songs from flowers
Good job homes
My son was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of 3 he spent 2 years fighting for his life and came out on top after flat lining twice. He is my beat friend and my favorite hero id ever be able to meet.  200 grand in debt later he is now 9 and healthy as ever! He is the strongest person i know and for this i will love him forever! This song hit so close to home for me it isn't funny.  Tom you are a great man and you have had my unbridled support from LeeAnn's son ! H.o.G for ever
Tom mcdonald bitch!  GOAT!!!
Such a beautiful song, nothing but the truth, this video will be seen by anyone who needs to see it. And I hope this one explodes
Dude you just keep outdoing yourself. This song is rough, even more so when someone is cutting onions around here.
thanks for the music
Tom this is Myron my father died of c o p d and cancer my mother had a heart attack they both died in my arms and the only like it popped my grease I worked as a nursing assistant and I'm nursing home about a year-and-a-half then I work for hospice for 6 years and I've been up more than 600 deaths then I stayed on working trying to work in the medical film for another 14 years it took its toll on me and now I've got a wife that's got COPD. But my life isn't that bad and I try to help all I can I do what I can for my hello man it hurts for me to talk about this but that's a very excellent video all I can say we need to help everyone we can while we still can Tom and Nova are they seem like family anymore have a great day and may you be blessed Having the courage to put us on that like this you said that
💛
Thank you for creating this song!! My dad passed away when I was 14 years old. Stage 4 lung cancer. He has been gone 15 years now. Wish my kids could have met him. Wish I had more time with him. He was so weak. Thank you again so much from the bottom of my heart. Ppl needed to hear this song. He passed 4 days before my 15th birthday.
🔥
This song made me cry hardcore, I had cancer when I was ten and went through treatment, chemotherapy, and radiation for four years, my sister also had cancer two years prior to me, I have had friends die from cancer. This song is so amazing and hits everything on the dot!
No one else is making music like this!! You really are making a difference in the world even if no one else sees it!! Truly amazing Tom! H.O.G for life!!!
This song really hits home! I've lost 2 husbands from cancer. One of them took their last breath in my arms and left me with 2 beautiful children, a girl and a boy. My 1st husband left me with one beautiful daughter. To those still fighting, NEVER give up! I have been so blessed by my husband's. I wouldn't change it for anything. Thank you for the new release! Much love and prayers to you.and yours my friend.
This hits hard, my girlfriends dad has cancer and doctors told that they cant cure it
I've had to wait to wait to listen to this 1. My whole family has had cancer it runs in my family. My grandmother pasted away 😢 8 yrs ago and I was disappointed in myself cause I was almost a 2 hour drive away and I was on my way but I  just stopped on the highway had a brake down and didn't make it. Thanks for this song. Tom💗💞
#cancersucks
My dad was diagnosed with lung cancer and died on Dec 25th in 2016 I was 10 at the time and went into a deep depression afterwards and it took me 2 years just to shake it off and then i discovered you Tom and thought you were hilarious and speaking facts and your music has been really cool and it's really helped me I want to thank you for everything and this song really hits the feels
I hope whoever dislikes this song gets cancer.
Speak the truth, keep it 💯
2 of my uncles have died from cancer, this song really hit a nerve in me. One uncle fought cancer for 5 years and left 2 kids behind, my other uncle died after 2 months of fighting pancreatic cancer, he left behind 4 children. It was a struggle to see them suffering.
For all those who have lost there love ones to cancer I’m sorry and I hope your okay ❤️we are all here to support each other ❤️
Thank you so much for the song. Watching it and listening to the lyrics brought tears to my eyes. I am a survivor I am 50 years old with 2 children  Who are now grown but one was in high school and 1 was a sophomore in college when I was diagnosed. Come to find out I had had it at least 10 years with no symptoms. I can't tell you everything that's wrong with me but I've had 3 hip replacements all in 2019 and to this day I have not driven a car or been able to walk on my own. I do the best that I can. I cherish every day and remember that God has a plan. I am so tired of everyone wanting to get rid of God and that bothers me. Very great video I'm very impressed and how you handled it lyrically don't get me wrong the video was great but my kids had a face losing their mother and that's 1 of the hardest things that I had to endure. You hit every nail on the head. Bravo!
This song hits pretty damn hard in the feels. Tom, you killed, man. A lot of tears were shed. Well. Fucking. Done. Love and Respect.
420 @ 2:50 nice
This song hit home for my so much. If the video didn't get me crying, the comments did. For those of you who have fought, are currently fighting, will possibly fight or fought along side a loved one, you have all my support, thoughts and prayers. Its so hard and half the people don't even know how it feels or don't know how it feels yet. I lost my Grandma to Ovarian cancer on February 27, 2014. It was so hard to watch her go through it. I have never seen her look so frail and broken. It was totally heartbreaking. The cancer took her so fast cause she passed soon after her first round of Chemo. It was so sudden and still miss her to this day. Thank you so much for making this song, for making it respectful and making it so beautiful. Theres no one who could have done it any better then you. Thank you once again.
You weren't kidding when it would make us cry. It sure as hell made my big 275lb ass balling like a baby. I have a friend who unfortunately passed away 4 years ago on September 30th from Ewings Sarcoma. He battled cancer for 15 1/2yrs of his life before cancer tragically took it from him. He was a brother to me. He was only 38yrs young. He served in the armed forces along with his wife. I miss him so damn much because I never got the chance to say see you later to him all because my ex hid the information from me that my brother was fighting cancer again and this time he was not going to make it. His name was Jon Gee.
My fiance was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer, she just got the results of her mastectomy and she is cancer free 🙏
Mislabeled true title "F Cancer"
Love this song. It is going to help a lot of people.
I'm teary eyed and my hearts in my throat. I had cancer in 2016. This spoke to my soul. Thanks brother.
Thank you for this Song. I have cancer with no radiation or cure. I am a fighter for my family. I love your music. It touches so many❣❣❣
Thx bro much love , I’ve been avoiding going to see my dying mum because it’s so painful and I’m only just beginning to realise I’ve been making excuses, I am going to man up and go visit her , the way she’s been since we found out , I have never been so proud of her , thx again bro
Tom shave your head and I will
My 2yo is a survivor! She is a warrior! This song touched me. Thank you bro
Lost my best friend to pancreatic cancer in February of 2018. He kept being promised this experimental treatment, or that drug test opportunity. In the end, he died a withered and depleted man, shot through from chemo and cancer cells spreading to other organs. The last joke he made to myself and another good friend when we were visiting him in hospice was "I thought this was supposed to be peaceful". He said this between gasps as his body struggled to stay alive. He was the man who officiated my wedding, and who held a lot of people I know up. His lightness of character and easy humor kept us smiling, and still does. A large group of people gathered in his hospice room to listen to 80's hair metal and see him off the night he died. Larry, you are missed every day by many people. Fuck cancer.
Speechless..... Thank You!!!
Thank you...its been 2 yrs since i was diagnosed with a disease that can develop into cancer as well as losing 3 of my grandparents to cancer life has been very difficult lately and I really needed to hear this to remind me why I fight and sacrifice just 2 be here for my son
Damn onion cutting ninjas... My father is going through chemo right now. This song and video helps.
I mean, for a Tom McD vid, I would actually cut my hair!!!! Well done as always, Tom and wife!
Just wow. Absolutely amazing brother!!
Damn, no lie this shit made me cry.
My god this is just beautiful.
I loved this made me think of Mommy thanks for the tears bro can't wait to see you
😣🥺 this is going to help people struggling rn
My dad pasted 2 years ago, after 4 years battling stage 4 lung cancer. He was a fighter, strong till the last couple weeks. I myself am almost 14 years cancer free (no radiation or chemo had them cut it out). It worked.
Tom thank you, this made me tear up. Cancer tried to take me when I was 16 but I fought it for 3 years. After it was all said and done I lost my mom to pancreatic cancer 1 year before she could see me ring the bell. Life isn’t fair, but we have to keep pushing and pushing....I guess
This is the most important message ever this is going to help so many people Tom
Another honest song
Who the hell hits the dislike button on this??
This track is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯 wish I could like it twice 💯💯💯💯
Shit hit too close to home Tom!
He was right,     We were going to cry
Absolutely love this... thank you for using your art to promote strength and hope.    Need more of it
Tom u prick ya made me cry having think off all the family I lost from Gov made cancer  Loving ya more and more

Thank you for this Tom !!! I currently have stage 4. Breast cancer and been fighting since 2014 , this song means a lot to me personally! #HANGOVERGANG4EVER
Bro I dot get why they can find a vaccine for covid but not cancer like what it's been here longer but they found it for covid first
Thank you, Tom.
Imagine if covid was actually serious.  Then it would ne another thing to kill us
RIP Aunt Debbie and Uncle Scott. You both we're awesome. Love you
Ok, who let the Onion Ninjas loose?.....
I love love love this my sister has stage 4 liver cancer ☹️
Wow! This brought me to tears. I've lost so many family members and a few friends to cancer. Hits home. ❤️ My mother-in-law is a 2-time lung cancer survivor.
This song made me break down I lost alot of people to cancer alot of family it's something that scares the hell out of me I seen it take the most strongest women in the world down to nothing in a matter of 6 mos. Thank you for this song I love all your songs but this one got me the most
178 people support cancer
I've been waiting to see what kinda video you were going to make for this song!! I love it! My dad passed away from leukemia whenever I was 8 years old and I remember watching him for years going through the bone marrow transplants, the blood transfusions, then they told him he only had a month to live and whether he wanted to die at the hospital or home and he chose home..... and he still lived for a year after that! He was such a fighter as I watched him everyday and Yeah he may have lost but he went out strong! 🖤 I absolutely love the song and new albums are just as amazing, brother! HOG For Life! 🖤
I’ve lost most of my family to cancer. I’m terrified for my girls.
Thanks . Song really resonates.. my little sister died of brain cancer at 30 years old leaving behind 3 young boys
Lost both my parents from cancer this song made me hurt
My dad died of cancer in feb 19 and I’m now in school to become a immunity research clinic tech so maybe I can spare someone of what I felt. It’s still hard, some times I feel like I should have went with him. It’s like half my heart died when he did.   Beautiful song Tom!
Powerful!!
😭
Cancer is very awful. My sister is fighting it now! I don’t understand when people say we need a “cure for cancer,” when we need “CURES” for more than 270 +/- cancers. We need cures, not just one cure! So, I pray we find as many cures for as many cancers as we can! Much ♥️ Many 🙏 Granny Winters 😊
Love this! Fug Cancer.
You suck
Lost my mom November 2019- coming up on a year. I still see her when I close my eyes.
There are a few who doesn't want to be here, I'm one of those few.
My mom is fighting cancer, has been for two years, thank you Tom, please keep doing you, H.O.G. For life
My grandma survived cancer
So many conspiracy theorists in the comments claiming to know more than scientists and doctors. Same people that don't get vaccinated and think a chiropractor is a doctor.
Just found out recently my uncle has angiosarcoma he's older and not know good health to begin with pray for him
Its a trillion dollar industry and if you have the money you'll be fine, for the poor and less fortunate its population control they don't give shit, I lost my grandfather/best friend to cancer and it still breaks my heart thinking of him. Great song Tom, keep it up buddy.
Lost my uncle to kidney cancer after it spread through his entire body. That man taught me everything I know when it comes to fishing, took me to lakes across the state. Not a day goes by that I don't miss him. He was the cornerstone of my family. When he died, it fell apart. RIP Uncle Vern.
My cousin just got diagnosed recently with brain cancer  He served in Iraq and Afghanistan and when he came back he struggled with PTSD he had to go away to a facility for soldiers struggling with what they saw over there and now he’s battling yet again  He’s strong and inspires me everyday  I don’t know if he even wants the credit but I feel his story is important  Please pray for him!
This is awesome
You should have just hired a bald girl...
Tom MacDonald is the goat
As a cancer survivor in remission, this hit me right in the heart.
Thank you for this song ❤️
WOW. Absolute masterpiece Tom. This hits very close to home not just for me but for a lot of others as well. From the bottom of my heart 💜 thank you 🙏🏼.
You did make me cry because those stats r so true both my grandfather and grandmother have 4th stage lung cancer and we lost my grandfather in July
This is one of the most touching songs you’ve made. My grandpa died a few years ago from cancer. I watched him go from being perfectly happy and healthy to not being able to get out of bed. This song will help a lot of people.
just lost my aunt to lung cancer 2 days ago, never smoked a day in her life. She had custody of her autistic grandson, as both his parents died of OD, his dad just 6 months ago. He is staying with us now. this song hit close to home, thank you!
God bless you Tom..  'nuff said.
My grandma is in her 80's. She is fighting metastatic breast cancer and winning! I'm so proud of her.
From one cancer SURVIVOR....THANK U TOM MACDONALD. BEAUTIFUL
Wow sad song but so true. Cancer is a bitch
Imagine being this stupid and going out of your way to tell the world. :P
Amen brother I am a survivor kicked cancers ass 14 years ago
My kids love "Authority Problem".  I recommend his cds.
i spent everyday for over 2 years comforting my best freind and cousin through cancer. changing his gauze from the section of rib and lungs removed from surgery.  had him die in my arms one night cause i refused to let him die alone. fuck cancer.
This song hit me hard as hell. My best friend had brain cancer twice and my first love died from it. I shaved my head last year for my best friend when his brain cancer came back. Sent him a photo showing him my support. Our hair is about the same length. He loves how you're real with your music. I hope he listened to this today. He's a fighter and I'm glad he made it. It was hard because we almost did lose him.
This is the one that got me the most. I lost family and my right KIDNEY to CANCER.  I'm always checking the left because it can come back.  Thank you for all your music.
This one hit hard cause my aunt died of cancer back in 2011.
I don’t usually comment on your videos but man this one hit me hard I lost my father to cancer back in 2012.
Ok .. im gonna say it.. not surprised tom would make a song called "cancer" after he made that coronovirus song.. he's a keyword for the masses kinda loser... no real artist would make a song like this guy... hey tom.. thx for reminding us that cancer exists while trying to show your 'sensitive' side after being a ppl are stupid obnoxious wanker
Gosh this song hits me I lost my father in law last December 💔 😢 because of this awful disease
God this IS upsetting. I got an email notifying me of this video saying 'you're going to cry.' So true. And its so true that EVERYTHING is becoming carcinogenic. I have Atopy and perfume sets it off. It got me thinking. Why are people all spraying themselves with such a chemical cocktail?
Turkey Love You Bro.We are love this shit. Loves From Turkey !
My mom recently past from unknown cancer
I lost my mom at 19 and my dad at 23 to cancer...fuck cancer...thank you for this ❤
cant hate on this one, good job
I'm not crying, you're crying!
Damn bro this song really hit me I survived colon cancer still in remission but still a fight every day thank you for this bro every word is so true
"Nothing matters if you don't have your health, All the money in the world doesn't help". That line hit me hard buts its so true. Health is the greatest gift!
Love this so much man. I've lost a lot of family to this awful disease. Fuck cancer.
Why's the chorus drowned out tho
Frfr the could just kill it with vibrations
THANK YOU for this Im in Remission 2 years now I beat brest cancer stage 2 but now here we are and I may be battling again they think it's back in my brain. Fight I shall and WIN I WILL. from the 18 of us in my family that have battle now, won, and lost, their battles. Thank you again for this.
Thank you Tom!! Fuckn love you brotha!! I’ve been battling Cancer for 14yrs now and everyday is a blessing!! Your music always helps push thru rough days and nights!! Keep doing your thing my dude!! #HOGfamily4life #realtalk 💯💯
Felt it 😔
Thank you Tom this was beautiful. I lost my father to cancer in 2008, the hospital said they were doing everything they could to help him, load of crap that was. They said to my mum that they could help keep him be around longer if she could come up with $40 000 for a new treatment  but couldn't be sure if it would work. The rich get richer and the rest of us die with nothing. #fuckcancer #fucktherichandpowerful
I love you Tom McDonald ♡
My step dad just was confirmed cleared of cancer what a day for this video and song thank you Tom Macdonald for your music....
Sitting in the waiting room to see if my biopsy came back as cancer or not 😬🤞
Yes.  Meaningful shit.  I dig it.
George Rothman my grandfather he went to a doctor's appointment check up all good but the next doctor's appointment a mouth later they say he got cancer before he came in for his first  appointment they say they didn't see it before and it could be Cured but he die a couple days after his birthday sad 😢
Wonderful song and video.
incredible. no other words
Tom you deserve an award,but i know they hate you for speaking the truth they rather give awards to rappers doing music for clout.
CANCER F'N SUCKS 😢
Very cool song. Thank you for this.
Bro thank you! It really hit me in the feels. Cuz my mom :/ but she's in a better place.
Thank you
Fuuuuuck.... you just hit me right in the gut. Now I’m crying in front of my 7 year old son.
I lost my mom to colon cancer, it’s a fucking terrible disease.
Lost my mother and my Grandfather recently! This hits home. Thanks Tom for real life music!
I have watched my mother battel cancer for what seems like a life time and it angers me to no end when i see doctors use it to get rich and politions use it to get elected
Sugar feeds cancer..Eat  a carnivore diet see how it goes.
💛💙💜💚❤
This song had me crying. I lost my dad to cancer when I was 12. I’m glad somebody out here speaking the truth
Great song!!!!!!!
I lost my two year old son to leukemia 12/07/07.  Children's cancers receive the least amount of research funding. I've been to so many children's funerals. It just kills something inside you.
Luv it
Damn..  love this!
My mom's birthday is today she survived  leukemia  2 years ago but is suffering from long term effects the radiation  and her treatment. She's staying strong. Love you Tom.
How can Tom MacDonald make a grown man cry?
RIP Ethan Alexander Foreman, I miss you big bro cancer took you to early.
Liked the song, just learned about your music a couple of months ago. Good stuff. Cant wait for the next one!
The claim of good go to heaven and bad to hell is incorrect - none are good says God - all deserve death - it doesn't end here, read the bible to learn the rest. Everything the priest has told you is a lie. Everything the religious hypocrites told you is a lie. Nobody goes to heaven because they are good. None deserve it. It is a free gift to those who believe onto the name of Jesus Christ, the true and living God who came down and took the punishment for our sins. There is no amount of good you can do to earn your way to heaven, contrary to what many preach. Why? So no man can boast. God said we are all the same, wretched and unworthy. He makes us clean through Himself, God saves us because we are too weak to follow Him righteously. Don't ever feel like you are not good enough and God does not want you - in fact, when you do fail, turn to Him immediately. Each day is a new day. Don't let yesterday burden you today. Look to God. Read the bible. Stop listening to man.
Thank you, we lost my mom to cancer in 2017 she was 59.
Amazing song man
Fucker, Made me cry 😢
Damn. This is making me cry
nice im early
This is really appreciated, my man. My wife and I are helping her mother through cancer treatment right now. It's been over a year now and even though she's got lupus stacked on top of this shitty disease, she's fighting and God willing, she'll see the other side of this. I've lost my grandfather and grandmother to the same damn shit. I keep praying that something changes and we don't have to watch out loved ones wither away for much longer.
People who dislike wtf is wrong with u
My wife has lost three fathers to cancer, yesterday her mom was diagnosed.
I've been waiting and waiting and waiting to see you will you come back to see me I'll always be a part of The Hangover game my name is Ronda Jones I don't know what's going to make it by the time you come back into town do me a favor sing the hell out of this song none of us wants to die
Love ya Tom.  On behalf of my mom, my dad, my aunt...  thank you.  Love you man.  We are losing our shit about <1% chance Covid takes us while cancer is knocking down every month as many that will die of Covid in year.
Another great one Tom !
Tom you just keep amazing me! Thanks for this, a lot of people needed this!
😢🤟🤘
My grampy died last year after being diagnosed with cancer in every part of his body, 12 days after being diagnosed he passed away, he thought prostate cancer 13 years before and beat it but this time he sadly passed and he was the kindest man and so loving, thankyou Tom for this song
well i beat mine. lost friends and family to cancer. watch 2 friends manage to beat it. 1.5 years cancer free!!!
This really hit home for me I lost the only aunt I was close to lung cancer a few years ago. Definitely cried like a baby.
the year was 2012 for me to wake up to the cancer scam i lost my mum to it and started my research and found out its all a con big business its a 100 billion a year money train and nobody is gonna stop it its a fucked up world we live in and its people like tom that can open eyes to it im so pissed off that i only heard of tom MacDonald this year hes the only rapper i can honestly say is real id love to see him do something with harry mack both super positive rappers and both at the top of the tree
Why does it have to be this way?
🔥🔥
Wow.   Just....wow.
You have no clue how powerful a lyric can hit somebody right in a heart.... I discovered your artistry over a year ago .. Every song i listen for pieces of myself... This one... Yeah this one... Truth in lyrics by a honest artist... Thank for making me a member of the "hangover gang" A Music Fan... 💜
It's  to true i had a grandma  who  passed  away  from  ovarian cancer  and I truly  can get behind  every  thing  u said
Thank you. I needed this and im sure alot of others did to. Keep it coming
Any 1 else thinking he was gonna shave his head after seeing those clippers?
Over 100 dislikes on t This song.. really shows you the evil in this world to hate a man singing about curing cancer.      Sad sad sad shit.   Praying for humanity right now.
Wait this got me thinking tom did you just find out you had cancer
This song hit hard. 14 years ago my mother lost her the battle i was 13 and didn't understand that god did it and tbh I still don't understand it to this day. Thank you for making this song
Sitting here listening to you song about cancer and I have cancer stage 4 I don't know how long I have are concerts tonight in Indianapolis I bought front row tickets because I can't be here long enough the other tickets but I'm not going to be able to make it I have a death in my family in as much as I love you Tom Family First if anybody knows that you do
Dope I felt the emotion ❤️ from Georgia brotha!
This song touches me beyond belief. I’ve lost 2 cousins and my grandpa to leukemia. My sister has beaten cancer twice so far. My mom passed away after only 8 days of her diagnosis. Thank you so much for writing this song
Brother we're all going through something in life I'm 37 and I've got throat and stomach cancer forming as a mass. But it's okay and I know a lot of people are wondering how can I say this at 37 because I'm not going to quit till the end. I've done more in at 37 they're more than most people do in a lifetime. Semper Fi
I know 3 ppl that died from cancer.. My dad was 1 of them
I wana leave this evil world more and more everyday. Lord Jesus come!   I'm so sick of hearing about this dude singing EVERY SONG about he has demons and he fights them and people saying I'm crazy. I pray for yall deceived. Turn to the one true God Jesus Christ and your eyes will be opened.
Love it ❤️🙏
May GOD have pity on the lost souls who disliked this song!! Thank you Tom. Too many of us are losing family and friends. Much love to everyone fighting the Battle. Lost my (Step)Dad 11 years ago to cancer and Now im about to lose my Father to it! 😭
My mom passed away 4/14/14 from cancer. I watched her go thru chemotherapy and radiotherapy for almost a year before she lost her battle. I shaved my head twice for her, and would do it all over again. This song is so deep and hits home for me. Thank you for making this song even though I cry every time I hear it.
I guess the ones that disliked this video are big pharma employees 🤷🏻‍♂️
no life shaq did a wonderful reaction to this video. great song and video tom and nova. keep up the good work.
I lost my cousin who was like a second mother to me to breast cancer, she was a strong happy and brave woman then she changed and got more and more sick until it traveled to her brain. No matter what though she joked around maybe a few hours before she passed she pretended to die then woke back up and said “you aren’t getting rid of me that easy” it’s a dark joke but that’s how she was. Though the day we lost her was the day my whole family fell apart it’s not easy but her life here on this earth was the most rewarding thing on the planet. She passed 5 years ago... R.I.P Nicole ❤️
Cancer is when your own cells mutate and grow uncontrollably.   Some people are prone or susceptible from birth genetically.   Some people drink polluted water, breathe bad air.  The economy depends on selling labor class people tobacco and alcohol known carcinogens.   Sugar and obesity,  the economy depends on selling you addictive foods.
My mother is a breast cancer survivor. Prayers to everyone dealing with this awful disease.
As someone who HAS INCURABLE Brain Cancer... This TOUCHED Me... wow... **I UPLOADED MY REACTION TO THIS SONG ON MY CHANNEL AS WELL!!**
I don't care anymore i will start rapping taking about the shite were taking in a 3rd world country thankfully i am leaving within a year how can i show u my gratitude and respect i have for u i am crying and typing so if this dosenot make any sense then tell me to write it again love ur music man
Epic! 🔥🔥🔥  Speak Truth to power brother, Power to the people.  🔥
The most powerful song I have ever heard!! Absolutely beautiful!!!! All we have to do is fight!! And we will continue!! Much love!
Damn bro you gave me chills with this one like no other...amazing
🔥💪👏 Truth Teller
I’m convinced cigarette sales are gonna skyrocket when they release the cure for cancer. Cuz people will be like, “I’m not gonna die from cancer, there’s a cure for that now.”
Just to those of you in the comments... are seriously none of you bothered by the fact that he's leveraging the emotional reaction to one of the most deadly and heartbreaking diseases in the world for profit? Tom MacDonald just says what he says to make money from clickbait and shock value. Honestly I think this is even abit below him. Next it will be about starving African children, or the holocaust... although most of his fans probably don't even think that actually happened
My friend got breast cancer and after surgery, after chemo therapy, she has to work full time being constantly in pain so that the insurance can cover her treatment. And really, like you say after billions of dollars and years of research, maybe there is no need for chemo, I believe there is an easier, cheaper way to treat this, we just are not told about it. And even if there is no other way, the system where a person in pain has to work full time to get treatment is inhuman. I know there are worse cancer stories out there. And this song is very much needed because it is an eye opener. Thank you.
So great thank you, your awesome
What a great song!
I just got off the phone with my friend who’s brother was just diagnosed with Cancer a few weeks ago (he’s 35) and she literally just told me his insurance doesn’t cover chemo.  This hits especially close as it effects so many.
I think the solution lies in genetic engineering; they take out cells, alter the T cells, then put 'em back in . Btw the song When We Die? is a real good look at death...
I've watched this several times since you dropped it. The song itself hits me in my heart. The video you knocked out of the park. Well done!
My dad fought off stage 4 prostate and stage 3 non-hodgkins lymphoma. I took him to his last round of chemo 6 years ago back in February. Last night I found a lump in my armpit the same place his lymphoma started and ill be honest im terrified.
I really like the message of this song. But besides the message of the song, his execution was (from a musical standpoint) not very good.
Love you bro! I knew cancer and many other diseases are curable, family don't want the confrontation even many of our family members have lost their lives to the cancer scam! Beautiful truth, beautiful.❤
this is such an emotional song amazing work man keep it up!!!
tru
G.O.A.Tom MacDonad
And he does it again everybody he's telling the truth again that's why i like tom
Speechless!!! Gr8 song music with a meaning!!!
Brilliantly executed good sir. Simply beautiful🖤

Thank you!!! I’ve been fighting since ‘14.
I love this song. my grandma died in 2015 from cancer the chemo killed her alot faster than normal. that shit doesnt help at all. and the most she fought it the worse it was. I appreciate your music Tom Macdonald. keep up the great work
You hit a homerun with this one it's gonna help alot of people including me I lost 4 family members in the last 6 years from cancer so thank you for caring enough to make this song much love
The world we live in. More profit in treating than in curing.
Just had an aunt pass away from cancer not long ago that touches bro keep up the good work love ya tom
Hey man everyone is going to die so we have to stick to changing you steps and try to find your purpose just know God loves you and he knows and had hope for you and you just have to give jesus he will change you your heart and your spirit I know I'm a human I have my floss I'm still 14 years old but is trying to better my self. The main reason people get addicted is because they what to hide from reality in your head there's demons you have to figth they will try to torment you reminding you of you past and making making you do drugs and Rob kill and crazy stuff but y'all keep y'all head up my grandma passed away and that cut me deep but I tried to stay strong and all I know she's in heaven that comforts my heart every day      Sorry for my english I'm Hispanic and mess up sum times

This song made tears fall from this hardened man's eyes....I've watched what cancer does on a personal level. I watched a girl just starting her life fight and live with osteosarcoma til it took her from this world. I watched her strength unite a town and city. I watched a kid be a super hero. Thanks Tom for giving us this one. I'm dedicating this to the Angel Katelyn Norman. She will always be my hero and taught me what a fighter really is..... Much love and respect to anyone dealing with cancer personally or watching there friends or family fight and suffer. #FightforCure #GuveUstheCure #Kate #angels #heros
I got diagnosed with multiple sclerosis this year. People seem to know less about it than cancer. All I know is that everything hurts and I'm so so tired. People just don't understand.
My dad just Died if Colon cancer on September 4th. His doctors waited to long to do radiation after they found small spots on his lungs. It was too late once it grew. He was only 52. He was the strongest man I’ve ever known and watching him suffer was the hardest things I’ve ever been through.
If you just eat boiled greens, you'll be fine.  Trust me...and avoid foods packaged.  Don't get tattoos either
Bruh this was a song that was needed. The message in the beginning is so true. We need more people like you in this world, that sees through the bullshit. Thank you for putting this out there. I pray for those who aren't doing so good  as well.
Well done, Tom. Knocking it out of the park as usual. Thank you for all that you do.
Spread the word  #hangovergang
It's unbelievable that this song comes out just when my oldest daughter lost het grandma today not to cancer but to this covid shit.  Ty Tom it really helps to listen to these songs.
Thank you Tom!  This is one of the most powerful songs yet!  I lost both of my grandmothers to cancer and the things that they went through, I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy!
This hits me hard almost 2 years ago i lost mt grandma to cancer she was basically my second mom and i miss her so much
This is a really heart felt song
Thank you Tom this song is going to inspire a lot of good people fighting an unfair fight. Lost a good buddy to cancer last year he fought till the very end
As a cancer survivor thank you. God Bless
That was beautiful. Thank you.
Its times like this we need to be there for another
You are such an amazing person! My friends uncle died today bc of cancer. Its so sad.
my father has been fighting cancer on and off for 17 years, they gave him a year.  Very powerful song.  loved every second of it!
Damn Tom MacDonald bro you have really made yourself blow up with doing life an be 143k views 2 hours wow
To be fair, some of us know where we're going when we die, but the message of the song is solid.  ❤️
I want to know who the fuck had the audacity to “dislike” this video!! This is an emotionally powerful video!! I got a family member dying of Stage 4 Lung Cancer, she been fighting it for over a year and a half!! #TooLitMafia #HOGArmy #HangoverGangMember #HangoverGangForever #TLM #EmotionallyPowerful
This one hit close and reminded me just how strong my wife was and is... 2 years remission from a stage 4 and just confirmed she is pregnant which they also said was impossible...  Keep doing what you’re doing Tom...
Its all population control!!
Amazing ♥️♥️♥️
Fucking BEAUTIFUL song Tom!!!!
Enough is enough, this is a song.
Dam bro so far none of my family has cancer and im thankful but hope who ever does survives and is doing well this hit hard 😔
Beautiful! Absolutely Beautiful!!!
I miss you Aunt Melinda
Plz stop smoking 🚬 and the food you eat is a big  Contributor to the life expectancy you'll have. Its facts that animal products  Are the leading cause of death  Obesity heart disease,  heart failure Heart disease remained the top killer in the U.S. in 2018, accounting for 23.1% of registered deaths. No one is going to live forever but what we can do is give our time to the people and things that we love and  Cherish so dearly  It's scary you don't know where you're going to go when you die. Let's help put a stop to the  Senseless slaughter and suffering.   .You won't know how to be brave To choose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength Till you've struggled to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith Till you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take Till you realize you didn't break you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor, when you're tired, you hold tighter, you have heart
We're dieing to keep living so why are you paying for things that are bad and addicting, they built a business off our addictions paying them to kill ourselves again we're dieing to keep living, we try to beat it just know cancer is also from trying to keep our demons a  Secret its time you start making the better decisions.  Most of our insurance don't cover  The things we need to  Defeat it  And even if it can we might die from the treatment.  Somehow we fight it like we pretend we don't know or it dosen't exist fighting it prying, hoping  That there is something after this. This might be you one shot make the best our of it. Tomorrow is not promised to everyone. 🌍💗
What can I say? You're the most inspiring rapper of our time. Your every words in every of your songs give us hope. Keep it up bruh. There's still good in us as human. Keep the world alive and there will be no end. As we live and let the future live too. Peace 😊✌🙏
RIP MOM.😥
Collab with Upchurch when?
dude you kill in every topic that you choose to sing about you can sing you can rap and your real. I have lost multiple people to cancer and this song brought tears to my eyes. Keep killing it.
Another masterpiece by Tom ...
beautiful
I have been fighting this cruel and evil disease for far too long. Sometimes you feel like no one truly gets what I'm going through... and then there's this!!! I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for making this song. I cried... because it validates everything I feel and because its so beautiful and to know that I am not just another person you walk past. I'm not another patient file I'm a person fighting this beast of a bitch and I am not as alone as I feel. You touched me to the core! THANK YOU so much! I was a fan before this now I'm a fan for life however long that is. A lot people will be effected, inspired and moved. God bless you for being such an amazing young man! Much love ❤😊
Vaccines and population control. Look into the fact that vaccines use mouse DNA as the binder. Mice die from cancer it’s in their DNA, you inject that poison and change yours. Also what do you think all of the chlorine and fluoride they put in the water is doing to you?  Look at the cancer numbers after they started using the MMR vaccines, coincidence I think not.
Goosebumps bro. You have outdone yourself once again. HOG 4 LIFE
I love you the more and more every time you put something out bro, keep it coming H.O.G always 🤟
You said we were gonna cry...I was bawling.  RIP Momma I miss you every day.
Dam tom this video was deep.. I was in tears by halfway
This is the kind of music we need to go mainstream and get rid of mainstream b.s. I'm so glad I found Tom MacDonald and many more #respect #ATC333
🤍 powerful message🤍
Brotha this is so impactful! Def got me teary eyed!
Like you said in the live stream definitely one of the most important/home hitting song/video you have done...Thanks Tom like alot have already said this will definitely help alot of people out there.
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚 WHAT IF CANNABIS CURES CANCER? - There's a movie titled it shows research too.   Tell them Tom!  There are many solutions that don't work for big business to HEAL Cancer! 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
Thanks for writing this. I very recently watched my mom go through triple negative breast cancer and complete chemo. It was insane, all my college fund went to her, and in the middle of everything I fell in love
The 170 dislikes are the ones who know the cure (there’s probably more to come)
beautiful song, beautiful message, great work, hits home. empowering. good job and to those struggling god bless, and sending all types of love your way <3
Quite scary that an uneducated entertainer can shill a fake news like message to millions of impressionable young people. Big pharma and governments do profit from illness, yes, these profits are cycled back into the system and create more innovation and medicine. We have doubled the life expectancy in less than 100 years from modern medicine and have helped millions of cancer patients that would have other wise died. The idea that it's all a scam is just moronic. Use your head, stop following the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and think. We are living in the best time we have ever lived in and idiots like you don't even realise. You wouldn't want to have lived even 100 years ago let a known 500. I HATE FAKE NEWS, I'm surprised Youtube haven't banned or sensored you, its alarming!
I am a cancer survivor of two different types this song is pretty emotional for me. Tom ur an awesome dude!
Thank you..from someone with metastatic breast cancer!
You did a fantastic job with this song! My mom worked her whole life just to be diagnosed with breast cancer 2 years into retirement, life changes quick, Shits scary.
How can people dislike this?
this song made me cry a lot I lost my fiance last November to cancer I still cry myself to sleep because I really miss her she was my world I feel like I lost a piece of me that can never be returned I feel like a shattered soul I just want her back I hope she's proud of me every day that passes by I wish it could have been me that died she didn't deserve to die she was so caring and thoughtful she would always go out of her way to help people she would always help people with their problems before she would help herself Olivia I miss you so much babe and I just want to say I love you I just want to hold you one more time
Cancer comes from our diets.   The chemicals we consume can not be eliminated and form cancers.   Consume a organic Whole Foods diet, exercise plenty.   The 🔑 to healing is raw milk kefir. The bacteria from this counters cancer. They won’t let you know this.   “Raw milk is dangerous” they said... bruh I leave raw milk on my counter for two days before I drink it, of course it has milk kefir grains in it.   Anyways Tom, beautiful song. I tear’d up a bit. Best rapper.
Bless your heart, darlin. This is amazing and so very beautiful!! Thank you so much.
love this
Wow I’m not crying.
Your right cancer is non-discriminatory...it effects rich, poor, all races, all countries..they need to find a cure
Man this one hit hard... I wish I was the one that got it not my mom, and the 5 others in my family. If I could have taken them all I would. 💯%
Keep calling out all of the Bullshit!! You are our voice!!!
I just survived ovarian cancer 💗 they killed around 80 doctors in 2016 that had alternative cures for cancer. George merkl discovered an ancient elixir that allowed the body to regenerate -he regrew his heart with it!he was also killed....i wish i wouldnt have had to lose my ovary....
Tom, you're doing a great job! Do me a favor and take at least a few days off and dont worry about any of the bullshit for a minute. Something tells me you're exhausted as hell. Go forget who you are to the world for a bit and let yourself just be Tom the human being. We'll all be here when you're back around.   You probably cant just up and do that asap, but I really think you should put it in the plans. You've more than earned a break
I have never met you but you have just united ptentialls millions. You are a fantastic person.
I have to put this out there. I am a father of two and husband married to the same woman for 22 years and I’m in my mid 40s. A few years ago while I was dealing with recovering from an injury leaving part of me in the sandbox of hell then blindsided by my dad being diagnosed with ALS from exposure to agent orange while in Vietnam as an Air force para rescue medic. To be battling my own insecurities to watch my dad shrivel up from being a rock I believed would never go anywhere I learned to fake being some super dad/husband myself. It wasn’t until about 10 years ago that I was hit with serious health issues from old injuries and a heart condition forcing my entire family to massively lower our “standard of living” that somehow all that insight my father tried getting into me truly saved my life. It felt like my eyes were opened and instantly everything I thought was something major to worry about and quietly deal with vanished. My point is something made me realize first I truly wasn’t appreciating having an amazing family and yeah shit can happen whenever and life always throws big challenges at you but to find what it mean to have a fulfilling life really means. We don’t have our big house and pool or lake house and honestly don’t care. I still am told I’m a ridiculously stubborn ass usually but putting all effort into what will most likely give my family a meaningful life rather than just stuff has been driving me for years now and honestly even missing parts of my own body doesn’t even phase me but actually providing a future no matter what happens for people who I care and having my family all doing the same is all anybody needs. Especially now I hope no matter how insane things seem if it gets to you you’re not paying attention to what matters. Stuff isn’t going to make you happy and won’t have any lasting meaning. Remember there is always something more important we usually overlook in our hyper tribal society that money or bigger toys or chemicals will never fix.
❤💯💯💯💯💯💯
Another fire message Tom 🔥 good stuff
Wow! Tom, you're amazing!
Beautiful song and beautiful messge
To add they do have a cure but they won't make the $ from curing  People 😠😔
Brooooo I felt this one so much ❣️❣️❣️💯💯💯
My father died of Kidney Cancer two years ago, so this song has impacted me greatly and in near tears. Thanks for this amazing song and video, Tom! You are the man!
wow that's powerful
Honestly I did cry, my little sister had gotten leukemia a few years back, thankfully she is now in the recession stages and only going twice a year to get checked. I love this song and everything you stand for! From me to you I Thank you for standing up for what you believe in!!!
Appreciate this song so much..the chorus gets me personally because we have lost several in our family due to different types of cancer
Lost one of my best friends to brain cancer last year. My mom had breast cancer and is going strong. Thanks for the song!
Lost my mom when i was 20,1 month before my 21st. it tore me up she my bestfriend. this song hit me so hard. Tom.. Thank You.
This song came out as soon as my wife went into surgery...
Beautiful sad and true. There is other treatments people please look it up there is Drs in this world that have killed cancer over and over with non radiation treatments and won
Amazing as usual Tom.
Hits home bro keep on the damn thing your the man!
Yes it will
At the time of writing this there are 162 thumbs down, how can and how dare you over such an important subject. I guess they’ve never watched or seen a loved one pass from cancer. Rant over.
I didnt cry but great song. Keep up the good work tom
Preach bro. Lost my grandma and my uncle to cancer.  God bless everybody.
Thank you 🧡
And yet we are going to make a big deal and destroy the world about a disease that kills less then 1%. Smh
This is my new BATTLE SONG!!!! FIGHTING Cervical cancer RN......but at least I have a FIGHT SONG 😉 Thank you Tom ❤️
I lost my father to colon cancer a few years back at the age of 19, I hate having a pity party so I never really say anything to anyone but this song did hit home. I often wonder if a cure exists (or existed) but I do agree if there is one that there is zero incentive for those in power in the medical industry to release it, much more profitable to not.
Thank you Tom. You have seriously helped me understand. I had both parents die in a year time span but this song hits me hard because my mom died of cancer. I just always wonder why it had to be her. So thank you for making a song that pulls on my heart strings. Much love and respect.
Damn...this one hits deep
you sob you were right i did cry amazing as always a very amazing song i just lost my aunt from cancer last month an ive lost many ppl from it threwout my life this song was needed ty tom
Ain't this some shit. I get notifications of people reacting to your song and never get a notification about the song when it comes out.  WTF! Youtube
It's refreshing to listen to music with meaning. Thank you, sir 🙏
Tom McDonald I listen to I Love you songs because I can relate to half of them I've been to it and it helps me get to it so thank you so much for making your music it's amazing and inspiration to so many people around the world that need it you truly are one of the greatest rappers of all time better than Eminem keep up the good work keep up baking to go work and congratulations on your success you're the only rapper you're the only artist that deserves the credit when your credits do you deserve every little bit of the credit does your music touches millions of people's you truly are one of the greatest artists of all time so thank you so much for making your amazing music and keep up the good work
Wow.  16 yr cervical cancer survivor here. I can’t tell the level this song hit me. Thank you so much. You are amazing.
Powerful song!
JUST WOW! thats all I can say!
don't have cancer, but a messed up nervous system, constantly fighting the darkness and depression, added this song to my fight against the pain playlist, thank you so much, Tom!!!
Nice job Tom!  You send a good message even when the content is something we don't want to hear.
Absolutely beautiful
Fuckin good one brother, brings back good memories. 🤙🏽🤙🏽💪🏽💯💯 God bless.
A great friend of mine lost his battle earlier this year. He was the kind of person that helped anyone and everyone he could with a smile on his face and never asked or expected anything in return. Army veteran, volunteer firefighter, career EMT and security officer. When it hit, it hit hard and quick. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to visit him or say goodbye. To this day I ask, why him? #FuckCancer
Thank you for this. It gives so many people hope and faith.
My mom has stage 4 cancer. I can relate
This shit hits home dude it’s crazy my dad had like 4 different types of cancer over 7 years doing chemo radiation experimental treatments etc leaves the country for cancer treatment and within a year no more cancer and another year since it’s been gone still nothing has came back they have a cure but only care about that money they would lose
I lost my dad 8 years ago to kidney cancer it was a hard time in my life Tom thank you for this song it got me in my feelings
...
So deep... so many tears ... every video nothing but truth. Thank you ...
Man that’s a strong song brother. I lost my Aunt to cancer. I also had one of the most rarest blood cancers in the world. I made it through with the grace of god. Thanks you for the song.
My grandmother just got diagnosed and it kills me thank you for this song
is nova's real name nova
Look everyone in my family is dead, most of them never survived the cancer. Except my Sister’s Wife.. Thanks bud..
ive been thinking for awhile they havent cured cancer cause theres too much money in it. now we got covid so maybe theyll cure cancer.
Your right bud this is crazy how we donate all this money for cancer and no cure yet sad we can cure other stuff but cancer is still a number one problem in our lives
You are so amazing and awsome tom thanks for always speaking truth...
Tom this song touched me in ways that I didn’t even know I was holding in the feelings about. I’m the 52-year-old Nana that wrote to you before saying I was a huge fan of yours. But I didn’t tell you is I’ve had systemic lupus for 24 years which is an autoimmune disease where there is no cure for.  It made me have to retire from nursing and go on SSDI and five years ago I also got a double Whammy when I found out I had breast cancer. I fought my way through a double mastectomy almost didn’t make it but I knew my first grandchild was on the way and I want didn’t want to miss it. Thank you for this song and I really wish someone would write about the suffering of so many of us with Lupus because I’m the lucky one to have lived as long as I have lived with it.  That is if you want to call what I go through living and I’ve lost many of my Lupus sisters and brothers and they were only in their 20s and 30s. Just wanted to let you know how much I appreciated you and your beautiful song.
Man this song brought me to tears.
They definitely have a cure for cancer!!! It’s sad they won’t give it!! Multi million dollars a year just in finding it plus all the jobs and donations. Do you think our government is really just gonna give that up no. He so right 100% n its wrong of government!!!!
CANCER I miss my momma that lost her BATTLE TO CANCER in 2013 R.I.P MOM MAY 23,1953 TO NOV 23, 2013 MARY M. BRADLEY LOVE YOU R.I.P
Wow, that girl just shaved off her wig!
My dad lucky survived after having cancer 3 different times.
a lot of wise words & truth in this song..
This song couldnt have came out a better time in just under 2 weeks from today, it will have been a full years since my dad passed away from lung cancer
Damn this song hits home. My son had leukemia and my wife had ovarian cancer. Both are now free and clear of cancer but that was a a horrible 7 years we had to go through. I pray for all those going through this terrible illness. Be strong and have faith you will pull through this.
Dislike people on this video deserves cancer.
I was adopted by my grandparents they were in their 50's, when I was 2. My dad Was on board the USS Missouri during the Korean war, he developed mesothelioma when he hit 65, by 70 he was gone. He was kept telling his doctor that he couldn't eat anything because he jaw hurt, this was during treatment for his lung cancer. They managed to get almost get the cancer under control but it had spread to his lymph nods and by then it was to little to late. I watched the toughest man I ever knew as well as the only man I was afraid of (soft spoken yet when he got mad run much like me) waste away. I was fine until the second toughest man I know my oldest brother (uncle) gave me a hug and said "He is in a better place now."
My little sister having cancer changed my whole life. Happy she beat it and is still here with us
😢😢my uncle beat cancer a 4 year battle then  got covid and died a week later..lifes been hard thanks for this..
@Tom MacDonald THANK YOU FOR THIS!! My husband was just diagnosed this year & it's so scary 😔... You're an amazing artist & your art feeds our souls. Thank You for that.  Sadly i had not heard of you until this year.  I'm so grateful your art showed up in my feed on that one random dark day.  I began listening to you speak through your art & it spoke to almost every pain I've ever been through.  Thank you again for sharing yourself with us & i will forever claim me a spot in the Hang Over Gang... PROTECT TOM MACDONALD AT ALL COST... HE IS A RARE BREED OF HUMAN & WE NEED HIS VOICE, HE SPEAKS TRUTH EVERYONE NEEDS TO HEAR.

Wow Tom , you got me in the feels with this one!! Amazing song , as always.  I can't even think of the words to say about this song except WOW!!
This song hits home because I lost my dad to cancer 11 years ago and recently watched my friends 6 year old fight cancer and pass away about a month ago. Thank you Tom for making this video it was awesome I loved it
Thank you for this song Tom so sad. my mom had breast cancer but she is one of the more luckier one and fought it and is 11 yrs cancer free
Another great song. Keep bring the message.
my mom has it now
Good job bro
Thanks for this man. You are amazing.
I lost my wife in 2014 to breast cancer. She was only 34 years old! She died in our house, in our bed, in my arms. She was my everything! It's been hard raising kids as a single father. Good stuff here, bro! #HOG #FuckCancer
Tom, you speak nothing but the truth man. Lost my mom to cancer 3 years ago. I would give my last dollar for another minute with her. Keep it up man
How can a 160 people dislike this? To anyone else that dislikes, please elaborate for me down below.
Thank you Tom I have loss so many family members to horrible disease. You know I heard that there is a cure two people told me, but they refuse to use it...big business! Love your video and my prayers goes out to all those that  suffering 🙏🙏✌👍💗😢😢
health care is a private business entity, never let the doctors fool you, they only care about yoru money. I absolutely feel that there is a cure out there, they refuse to share it with the world sicne it is a billion dollar industry like Tom is saying. Its sad really.
A lot of assumptions about cancer, i think tom has little knowledge about cancer and how it works, i typically like his songs but i feel like this one was more so for the money
This shot mad me cry. My wife went through it and is still living
This will help hearts. Thank you!
Tom, I'm just a guy from all the way across the world, Libya to be exact, and I'd like to say that I appreciate your work.
Thinking about my uncle who fight to live after cancer..
Real. All I can say. Real
this will help so many people Tom Love you man ♥️
Not a banger but still appreciate your hustle and music
Wow just wow tom
My dad had stage 4 brain and lung cancer, the doctors said without treatment he had 1-5 years.  With treatment he could live at least 5, I advised no treatments but he believed in the medical BS and within 6 months he went from normal functioning to life support and died.  Radiation and chemo just to cash on his medical insurance.  The total bill for his treatment was close to a million.  We need to stop this insane thinking that we can't cure it and release the cure known now.  It's not rocket science but it's a immune system reaction and DNA issues.  RIP dad🙏 #HOG thanks for making this song💯
Thank you for this. My wife is a survivor my two aunts lost the battle and now I have a Cousin in the battle. My eyes water my heart fills with sadness and joy the emotional roller coaster is real. Live life like today is your last. Say I love you hug them often life is short.
What a blessing you are...
cancer or not this song hit on so many levels. this song made me think about how someone out there may have felt if i left the world when i tried  to years ago, it made me think about how i would feel if my son (the only family i had for a long time) was diagnosed.. i dont think i could go on without him. tom your music is inspirational but WHEN YOU MAKE SONGS SO HEARTFELT LIKE THIS DAMN IT YOU MAKE ME CRY
😥❤
This song is so true. Truly hit home. Lost family members to this killer. RIP to my family members.
You hit it out of the park again....
Tom that was a very touching video. Brought tears to my eyes. I had a scare a few weeks ago. Said they found something on my breast. I prayed hard waiting to do more test. Thankfully it turned out to be nothing. It's never a pretty sight watching people go through what they have to when they do have cancer. Thank you for all your amazing music bro. Love ya
Big tech is gonna censor this! They don’t want the masses to realize the corruption and lives they are costing in exchange for heaven
This hit home soo hard,thank you
Med beds are on the way. Thank you.
I'm in Love with this guy!!! I'm getting Goosebumps!!! And I'm also crying!!!!!
Tom all i can say is this song is the most important cancer song we all dont understand we should already have a cure and not a treatment that makes the host of the body weak and useless but it take the flame in the soul to allow you to burn through all the tears , treatment and even to walk or even move a finger   Tom you will change the world soon your really woke and spiritual I can tell there's this glow around you that evil cant take away your soul is at its purest form and keep it there
Wow....this definitely a strong song...hit me right in the feelers. I was close to losing my dad to cancer, he says I am the reason he fought so hard to stay with the treatments and I am so thankful to have a more years with him around. Thank you sir for all the good.music and positive vibes you release.
This is amazing Tom, keep it up brother
As a kidney cancer paitent at 47 bro this hits home in a whole diffrent way . tom ur the fucking man bro .u say what is real and what most people are to pussy to say . i bang ur shit in my jag all the time . keep up the good work bro and keep tellin the truth. Keith
This song hits home big time I've lost seven family members to cancer and I'm worried how many more might have  cancer they call it the down winders because of the stuff they've done in Idaho
I’ve been struggling with the thoughts and fear of death for a long time. When we are young we don’t really know what we are till your youth is gone. Life’s just a hour glass running out of sand. I loved the song man great message
But you’re a fighter! Good song Tom this song will touch a lot of ppl
This is and amazing song. I lost my mom to cancer. She was my guardian angel. This song brings so much love to everyone that is affected weather it be the person going through cancer or the family that is supporting them. Thank you Tom for another great song.
I was in a car crash and got a cuncusioon just days ago
For everyone who has cancer you are a survivor and you are strong. Your all loved and everyone cares about you. I know I do even if we haven't met.
I fucking love you so much for releasing this song Tom!!! This is stuff that I try to preach all the time, weed cures so many things by the system and has been proven to help with several types of cancer! People don't know about it though because big pharma has been hiding it for so long!!! To anyone reading this message that has to deal with cancer, I'm so sorry for you, but you are so much stronger than the cancer!!!  Don't let it or anyone take what you have in your life, there are more cures out there than radiation that are better for you! Always do your research before you put ANYTHING into your body so you know what's going to happen. As usual, this song is fire as fuck, and I'm going to be sharing the fuck out of it! 😁🔥🔥☯🤘
This is one of your best song and your right there is a cure they don't care about no one but money!!
Why dont we have more like buttons!!!!
No!, youre crying! Lol powerful man. Thank you.
One of the best song so far keep it up and don't give up
This so hard that some people missed the like button
GET SAVED THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. Amen.
Bro not only are you one of the realest,most down to earth, and most fire rappers in the game, you got hella heart!!! Much love and respect to you and Nova bro
I remember reading into cancer during my college years after I lost my brother to it and I think cancer actually can be beaten, but it requires nano-robotics that we dont have access to yet that can individually attack the cancerous cells that keep trying to divide and destroy their telomerase and the parts of the cell that cancer hijacks to keep producing massive amounts of it.  Thats why radiation is considered a treatement for cancer, because it outright kills the cells, but also hurts the healthy cells of the person who is recieving the treatment and potentially causing cancer in other places because of it.  But I am almost 100% confident that if we could get efficient and effective nanorobotics that we could target the cancerous cells and destroy what makes them biologically immortal and what makes them reproduce at such a rapid pace that it causes harm or death to the patients.  The biggest thing to remember is that cancer causes the cells to divide so quickly and so often that it causes the genetic coding to degrade and cause tumors or other health complications that end up killing the patient, but if we could find a way to make these cells non-biologically immortal by either harvesting their telomerase or destroying their reproductive cell organs before they have a chance to divide out of control, then there is a good chance we could use that telomerase to give ourselves biological immortality and let the cancer age itself out, flip the script on it.
I lost my Grandmother to Cancer, this song hits that spot </3
Tom you are an amazing person. My mom has been battling cancer for 3 years now.  This song will help so many people.
That made me cry 😭
My grandad just passed from Cancer leas than a month ago. Thank you so much Tom.
Totally didn't cry....love this song, really beautiful, keep doing you and making a difference ❤🙌
I'm 32 goin on 33 I lost my mom in 06 she battled it twice she lived 11 years longer than they said she would the first time....I love you mom and all you mom's fighting out there
Beautiful song bro. ♥ For those that might need it: https://www.cancertutor.com/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjkzfeJz66o
big pharma isnt about curing anything. they make too much money selling the drugs to treat  the issues not cure them. anybody know of any drug that actually cures anything?
This touched my heart my friend died from cancer she couldn't afford the treatment.
Thank you Tom. I lost an aunt to this battle. Pancreatic cancer to be specific. If only I could have played her this song, she would have loved it just as much as me. We love you man, keep doing you and being as real as it gets💯
What a shit day I'm having thank Brother 💪😎👌 keep the Truth coming love ya brother

Had a friend of mine lose his one true love to cancer last year, leaving him and their children alone to face the future.  Thank you for this, Tom.
This one hits home man. My 5yro daughters favorite songs during her treatment last year was "Everybody Hates me"  She is doing great now just hit 1yr with no additional treatment, but damn if I don't have tears on my face rn...
Beautiful and heart melting

How does anyone give this a thumbs down?????????! Amazing track! Honest! Raw! Real!!!!!!! 💯💯💯 on this one Tom!!!! #Salute to your honesty and authenticity!!!!!! I’m a huge fan! Keep keeping it TOM 💯 #HOG 👍😎
🙏😢❤ Wow! ❤😢🙏
It’s the songs he makes like this one is the reason he is one of my favorite people ever...🙏🤟✌️
Last year i lost my aunt due to cancer she had a little bump on her lip and she went to our local hospital to check it out and the doctors thought it was an infection,  gave her antibiotics and sent her away, she took them for a month and had no results the bump started growing into a large mass and she fell really sick couldn't eat or drink now my other aunt both my dad's sisters has stage 4 brain cancer and she's under hospices and they are saying that she may pass in a few days and it just fucking kills me, thank you Tom for making this song
My dad passed away 23 years ago from bone cancer...admitted on friday diagnosed on saturday and passed on the sunday...I believe every disease has a cure...and every cure is buried because the money will stop...Keep on speaking TM...Thankyou for this !!! Canada Love!!
💯hog4life and forever 🙏
My mom has stage 4 ovarian cancer and it was the scariest moment of my life when I found out. It all sunk it when her hair started to fallout and we had to take her to chemo all the time. She’s the strongest person I know and beat it. She beat stage 4 ovarian cancer and stage 2 breast cancer. Thank you Tom for the great song!
SONG OF THE YEAR!!!!!! HOG FOR LIFE!!
I want to thank you for this song, this song made me cry and realized some stuff about myself, because I have been living in fear, because im in the early stages of leukemia, and i have to get a bone marrow transplant sometimes this year, and I have to go to a different state to have it had, so im not going to have my family and friends around, when im having radiation done, and i have to have that done for 7 days straight, then have the bone marrow transplant and hope and pray it thanks..
I had to pull the plug on my father when I was 26 cuz cancer the hardest thing I ever had to do
hits hard husband has lung cancer but he is fighting hard
Tom this song hit too close to home ...my Mom is battling cancer for 2nd time!! I pray🙏 She can Beat Cancer agian! 🤷‍♂️🙏 I plan on making song too! God bless everyone!
Fr man fr whew keep up the loves bro fr
Had to swallow some grief during this one
Damn Tom 😭
Me and my wife watched her grandfather go through cancer we was their when he opened his eyes one last time smiled one last time then he just went to sleep then the long beep of that machine he was plugged into...... hardest thing I’ve done yet is try and comfort my wife as she lost the closest thing to a dad she had...
You have no idea how close to home this hits me! My mother was given 3 months if she didn't fight, 3 years if she did. It's been almost six years!  The chemo she has had has shrunk her "mother cancer" tumor to the point it can be radiated and gone. The other seven or more little baby tumors are already gone.   When Tom says "Don't Give Up," my mother is the proof of a FIGHTER. You CAN do it!
Thank you for this my dad beat cancer but it cost a fortune!!!! Still paying 10 years later !!!! Bullshit
Early gang ✌
To bring up the vibes a bit, today my grandma beat cancer! :)
I needed this man.. I lost my dad to lung cancer 12 twelve years ago as of yesterday
😢😔 fk m8 u sure the hell no how to open wounds that i fight like fk to keep closed luv your music man but this one got me to be 💯% honest....👍🏻👊🏻
As someone who lost grandpa bc of cancer, thank you for making this.
He heard it <3
Food 4Thought.☝🏽
Thank you for this. So many tears. My best friend died of cancer when I was 19, he was 21. Years later my Daddy had the most deadly cancer with a 1% chance of living. Thanks to his doctors at the VA and God, after many major surgeries and a year in hospital recovering, he is 10 years surviving. Miraculous, even his doctors call him their miracle man. Never give up hope or the fight. Love you Tom and Nova, you're bright lights in a sometimes dark environment, I so appreciate you both, and all the hard work you do to bring better days to all. 🙏🏽❤ God bless you
I dont who disliked it but they need some treatment for real
Everyone needs to like and comment on this to get that YouTube algo poppin lol. This needs to TREND!
Great song as normally with you brother .. keep making shit that is true as I am sure you will .. hmu
One of our best friends is watching her dad take his final breath today 🥺 Thank you for screaming the truth!!! ❤️ #FuckCancer
When we die we become high frequency energy free from Matter. Higher frequency is peace.
Love it
Thank you so much for this song Tom!!! My Grandpa died from cancer 7 years ago and not a day goes by when I don't get emotional about it also my Grandma has cancer but she beat it and one of my favorite actors Chadwick Boseman recently died from it too. I really got so emotional watching and listening to this song but it's really beautiful. Thank you once again Tom!
Tom awesome job, tank you for this song man i really relate to it
My 31 year old passed May of this year from Leukemia, no one in our family has or had it. She was a pet groomer I believe the chemicals caused it. I miss her every day
Thank you for the support Tom I love all your music iv been battling cancer for a year and a half I stay strong for my wife a daughter ...much love keep making amazing music
You should be proud T
Thank you for this song helps big time.
This is truly deep! Thank you Bro!  And if you think about it, Cancer is the true evil disease! Worse than CoVid! Think about it, for CoVid-19 there will be a vaccine next year! You might have to take that every 6 month but hey... Cancer...no vaccine! No nothing! Only prolongation!  Think about the diseases that have been around a long, long time now! Cancer and HIV being top of the list! And still, no cure! We need a miracle!
Mad props to Nova and Logan on this video.
Thank you  so much for  this  song  my bestfriend  die from cancer this  is  my new  fire
Thank you for this song helps big time.
Incredible! 💜💜💜💜
Lost many great people in my life over cancer the saddest part is your watching your loved ones fight a battle that you can’t help at all that’s what really sucks! Thanks for the beautiful music I hope the best for you mr Macdonald! ✌🏻
Thank you for this. I lost my grandma to cancer 3 yrs ago. She was more than a grandma.... She was my best friend. I miss her. I still have her house phone number saved as Nanna. I still can't bring myself to change it. I'm going through some shit i wish i had to talk to her about. She was good at giving advice. Rather you liked it or not.....she was probably right lol. I took care of her the last 2 months she had here. She made it know she was ready and to see her sister again. R.I.P. Betty Jo ❤ ❤ ❤
Hey Tom, my Aunt just passed 2 days ago from cancer... this couldn't of come at a better time. thank you.
Rip mom it's bean 10 years and miss you like crazy.
Another one that gets you right in the heart. Good song Tom. My mom got cancer so this song hits home. Keep fighting the good fight
Tom McDonald keeps attacking all the right things.
I’m a cancer survivor as well was diagnosed advanced stage 4, it’s been about 8 years since and during 5 of those 8 were a whole other hell, things are finally in a good place and I’m happy but I still feel the scars sometimes and as sad I get remember it’s also a reminder of we’re I am now and we’re I was this brought tears to my eyes for so many reasons we love you tom
I can't afford to be reading all these comments. Especially not after listening to that powerful song. Y'all gonna make me cry 😥😥
My mother passed away from liver cancer in 2018 so this song really hit me hard, thank you for this Tom, I needed to hear this.
Tom I've been listening to your music for a while now, just wanna say you are an amazing artist and seem like such a good/genuine person.
Made me cry foresure dude !! Love ya bro...⚡⚡Slumlove⚡⚡ 💗
I've lost friends and family to cancer and I've had friends and family survive cancer. Both are rough when you see a loved one suffer. It makes me sick knowing big Pharma has a cure but they and their insurance buddies wanna milk us for all we're worth along with the doctors who take the worthless hyppocratic oath. Funny how that word looks so much like hypocritical huh. I hope this song inspires people to keep fighting!
man I used to hate on you but wow this song is honestly touching
I needed this! Thank you.
Corn
What kind of disgusting vile human thumbs down a video as powerful and heart wrenching as this! 😔😔🥺🥺
✊🏼
Wow I love this it hits home Tom lost both my parents to cancer & my sister is fighting it each day. Thanks for the great inspiring & real music! The video is so real.
I watched a documentary the other day and there are cures but only for certain types of cancer, not to be a ❄️ but I just thought I should say, do what you want with this information
If there was a pill that killed cancer they would never make it available because they make more money treating cancer then they ever would curing it .
Thank you Tom for this absolutely beautiful song ❤️
Wow incredibly sad yet inspiring and beautiful song with so much truth in the lyrics and delivery... Music needs more Artist like u that actually have a message,tht r exposing the hypocritcy around us and most of all think 4 themselves..Bravo👏 man keep up the good work🙏
Your a damn good man Tom that’s no shit.
Lost both my parents to it, my Mom 4 yrs ago after a long battle with it, and my Dad just this past June, it took him in a little over a month. Both of them had beaten cancer once before but in both of their cases it came back after several years of being cancer free. I hate the shit with a passion, and often think the same things you mention in this song, and wonder how the hell they haven't found a cure.
🔥♥️✊
This hit me in the feels bro..! 😓 But thank you for the powerful message. I agree with one of the previous comments; this is gonna help a lotta folks. I've lost close and loved ones to cancer, some fo which they dont even know how to treat; experimental drugs and meds, radiation, etc... I hate "The System"; it's crazy how perpetual it is and we pay for it.. thank you for being the amazing Lyricist you are, and helping spreading these messages. 👏👏🙌👌
Deep and relatable, incredible.
I had a neighbor, well she was more than a neighbor, she was family, I had known he my entire life and she was the sweetest person ever, she was elderly and was diagnosed with stage four brain cancer, she passed away during the height of corona, her entire personality changed and she was in pain, bc of rona I wasn’t even allowed in the church for her funeral, she was family to mine and we loved her, this song describes the truth, thank you
Right in the feels!! 🙌
Well Tom you were right. I cried. And once again an amazing, heart touching song. I love you and please never change!!!
Cancer just took my best friend about 4 weeks ago
Thank you for this song! As a cancer survivor this hits home so hard for me! And even if you are a survivor cancer stays in your head, soul, and life forever! Again thank you for this!!
And you stole my haircut lol
Damn. That was awesome. Love the new video. Keep it up bro. I hope your music reaches the world. 💯💯🔥🔥
The is amazing
Who are the actors in your video? My mom survived breast cancer and I was there every day and every appointment taking care of her. That was 10 years ago.
HOLY SHIT from a man who fighting cancer and lost a few of the closest people to me to it this song on another level thank you Tom
Damn Tom.... 🐐
Bro this is so powerful for people🙌🏻👏🏻 Thank you for always talking about hard topics and addressing them in a powerful way through music🤘🏻🔥 #HangoverGang
Damn tom McDonald very deep glad I'm here to watch you do your thing fucking amazing
Dude Tom's the only dude on this planet to make me tear up from a song no matter where I'm at....what he does is a beautiful art.
I lost my grandmother to cancer over a year ago and have recently learned it runs in my family and myself and my daughter have a high chance of getting it... I bawled like a baby watching this, it’s going to help so many people through so much pain and heartache, thank you
It's been almost 2 years since we lost my mom to cancer.  Thank you for this song, Tom
My cousin had cancer a few years ago He beat it but now My uncle now has a Liver Tumor he got a few months ago And he now has heart issues And the cancer is making other things a bit worse Praying for him and others with all of these sicknesses
All I can say is I love it you make the realest music ever keep on keepin on brotha
Love this bro
My grandma is suffering with the big C atm and this has just opened my eyes a whole lot more you always speak facts bless up 🙏
Rip Grandad your the coolest person I've ever known!
Lost my wife june 15th. 5 year battle with breast cancer. Treatment gave us more time but to me it still wasn't enough.
The year I joined the Army was the same year My Grandad (Leukemia), uncle (Lung), and Mother (Lung/Brain) all died of cancer. I've lost half of my family and extended family to some form of cancer. This song hits deep. Thanks Tom
Daaaaaam ,😭
Whoever gives this a thumbs down has a sad soul.
Was waiting for this  5 minutes before it came out And I fell asleep  Now I’m late
Bro this video an song just Touch my Heart! Thank you for that!
This hit home even more so then most of your songs😥 . The last time my eyes watered like this is when my mom passed at 51 . The healthiest person in my family and the most carless beautiful soul I've ever met and likely will never meet another . You really find out the kind of man you are when you watch a love one deteriorate to nothing and die in your arms . But songs like this help you move forward and I appreciate it and I appreciate you man , thanks for calling out the murderers that just think of the money and not the cure cause she may still be here if not for such incompetence. Rest in peace mom you'll always be in my heart and the hearts of the loved ones that enter my life , everyone in my life will know how beautiful of a soul and woman you were you will never be forgotten🥰♥️♥️
19yr ago today i was 17 i lost my bestfriend MY MOM to cancer THANKS FOR THIS BROTHER KEEP DOIN WHAT YOU DO
My grandfather was diagnosed last year. He pretty much gave up hope and accepted he may die. He went through 12 rounds of chemo, a few surgeries, a drain, and many hospital trips and immunization trials. Despite everything, he’s doing well. Thank you for this. It’s so different from your other videos and I love this. Really. It gives me hope.
💯 real shit you saying in every song it's are dam government tom ppl and kids are going to bed without shit to eat and look what the government is doing we the ppl have to over throw all them out r house
Another great one!!!!!!!
This is amazing Tom we'll done
Here to claim my before 1mil
After walking my dog this morning at 7 pst, I fell back asleep and I dreamed of my grandfather who we lost to cancer three days into 2018. Tom, Nova... you guys never cease to amaze me. Thank you for this song, this video. It got me in my feels. 😘🤘🏻♥️  #HoG4Life
Family member was just diagnosed with cancer. Starts radiation on Monday.  Great song. Hits home with every word.
Damn straight facts
God bless you and your work brother
I’m not sure if this is a message from God, but my neighbor, a mother leaving behind 2 girls and her husband, just died this morning of Cancer, and when scrolling i saw Tom had dropped Cancer, and that’s a crazy coincidence. Really think it’s a message from God.
I love tom
You won't know how to be brave To choose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength Till you've struggled to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith Till you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take Till you realize you didn't break
Got me right in the feelings Tom!  I have never teared up from a song till now. Thank you!
Speaks the truth what a legend 💥💥💥💥💥🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Ive watched multiple ppl go through cancer, blood relatives, and friends that meant more to me than family. Some beat it, other, couldnt hang on. This hit me so fuckin hard. Beyond sad and pathetic big pharma cares more about the money for treatment rather than a cure. To all you watching this video, if you come across this comment. Keep fighting!!!!!! You have more ppl behind you than you know
Nova is so talented.thanks for the video.
My dad died from cancer and it was one of the hardest things I've had to expierance
At 1:22 Amen! Bless everyone!
Tom you hit this hard, my dad passed from cancer amd every word you said hit like ton of bricks....
Thank you so much!!! You got all the support!!! My family has cancer in our family. You are speaking all the truth that me and my family has been thou!! Thank you so much!! You are the best
Lost my mother and a friend both to cancer, thank you for this ♥️
toms next album should be called "Truth and Tears"
One of the few things I know can beat cancer is to eat lots of veggies, fish and take a walk in nature, away from any source of radiation. Secondly is to measure your acid level, flesh can go out of control if the level of acid are wrong and the cells will go crazy. Beaming the area in question with two different frequencies is said to help eradicating the cancer cells, but yeah... we all know someone. But are you really sure it's in the genetics and there is nothing you can do to prevent it from happening? Not on my watch!
When I was young I heard all the horror stories about the C word and thought nothing of it... 30 years later and I'm ashamed to say I've lost count of how many people I know who have died from this horrible disease... 2 just this year alone SMH
I lost my grandfather because of cancer two years ago,still seems like it was yesterday 😢
OMG in the email I got you said I would cry and you were right. I was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2018 but I was lucky. My pulmonologist had sent me for a lung screening and we caught it in stage one. I went for 4 cyberknife treatments and they worked. Now I just have to follow up with CT scans and blood work to make sure it doesn't come back. I am a cancer survivor. But this diagnosis put me on a path to becoming an Herbalist and what I found was that there is a cure for cancer and for the life of me I don't know why it is not being used. Well I do know why because Big Pharma won't make any money if everyone knew the cure. There are 4 types of medicinal mushrooms that have constituents in them that can cause cancer cells to self-destruct. They are readily available and they are eatable. When I read this in my lessons I wanted to make tinctures of these mushrooms and hand them out to every cancer patient I could find. I was so infuriated that this is not being utilized and people are suffering and dying. Now I am probably going to have to buy a bullet proof vest for posting this on here. LOL
Well done, keep putting the truth out there💛
Cancer and the medical system are screwed,  I lost my mom to them both. Thank you Tom.
I love this. Thank you so much Tom. The world needed this
Yeah to the 150 p.o.s's that gave this a thumbs down. Go look at your phone and hit that unsubscribe button. Because you dont need to know what tom has to say if you gotta dislike it. And tom keep grinding
You always on the truth🤔🤔
This. Lost my mom in January to cancer. She was diagnosed 10 months before that. They told her she had no chance but they kept pushing more treatments. You’ll do anything to save your life, even if there is no hope.
Hit me hard, at 14 years old my sister had cancer, i witnessed it at 15, she had a 11% chance to live. She is now 26 in remission for 8 years now. This brought a tear to my eyes
My friend died from a brain tumor when we were 16. My cousin is fighting cancer for the third time. A good friend of mine was just diagnosed with stage two Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Thank you for this, Tom.
Hell Yeah Tom!!!! Keep being real and speaking the truth when everyone else turns a blind eye to the shit. Man your music has helped me to find the strength to get back on my meds. And this song should be the CANCER AWARENESS ANTHEM!!!!!!!!!!
Last year my grandfather passed away after a 2 year battle against cancer. This is an amazing song and I really appreciate you for this one. Much respect
Thankyou soldier 🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸
Fuck, Tom your music is something special homie. You are a legend. Nothi.g but love from Milwaukee Wisconsin brotha
Well done
This is why Tom is one of the best. He speaks truth wether it’s good or bad. Things we need to hear and acknowledge. I think you touched a lot of us with this song. By far one your best! 🙏💯❤️
This has to be one of if not the deepest heart felt songs you have put out.  It put me to tears.   Keep up the work my friend. You are awesome.
This hit so close to home for me and not just for one person in my life... Thank you this is amazing ♥️
Thank you. I go for my biopsy monday. This is my second go around. The first time was breast cancer. This time i am facing lymphoma. Trying to stay optimistic but it's hard and scarey. I am 47. And terrified. I lost my mom to paratoneal cancer after she went through 4 rounds of treatments. Early onset dementia started and she just gave up after that. Cancer was back too. She couldn't do anymore treatments her body couldn't take it. It killed me to have her tell me she was just going to stop eating and let nature take it's course. She passed 3 days later. 2 days before her birthday. My dad died of lung cancer so i am triple negative and genetically high risk. Even though i don't show genetic markers.
I lost my mum to cancer last year and I’ve always blamed the doctors, they were more keen on sending her home to die than saving her life.
Very powerful dude...  one of the few rappers that actually sings about REAL things. Good on ya mate. Glad I found out about you
I have not donated to a single "cancer" fundraiser in almost 20 years...it's all bullshit. I am pretty sure we have the medical technology to do something about it. Problem is, there is no money in the cure, there is, however, TONs of money to be made in the treatment. Why would they eradicate their main source of income? They won't. Our healthcare system is fucked almost as bad as our country is right now.
Tom McDonald you sir are a complete and utter bad ass! It’s people like you that make this world a better place, be proud of everything you have accomplished because you deserve it all. I only hope that the rest of the world will see the message you’re bringing to the masses not only about this, but drug addiction and everything else that is wrong with this place we live in thank you for all that you have done I wish you and your family Only the best life has to offer.
Just brilliant
Yeah look there is no cure for cancer obviously, TomMac stick too offending people. Its what we need it right now, none of this "cancer" People follow you because you are not afraid too say what everyone is thinking. Stay on track and keep it in check
Lost my best friend of 25 years this year....he would have been 33 on Oct 15 2020....#fuckcancer...
Another  banger 💯 thank you man ✌
My mom has cancer and her treatment (routine tumor removal surgery) has been postponed months due to “covid” and “no elective surgeries” if it’s not “life threatening” ... but her cancer came back due to them postponing checkups and now they’ve postponed the surgery... exhausting. Trying to get her to eat healthy and take care of herself while we wait to get an appointment. Prayers to everyone’s going through this fight, especially if it feels like no one is helping. My mom is strong and I know she won’t give up.
My grandfather died from prostate cancer, my parents both have had skin cancer, just today I found out my boss has cancer. Numerous people I know, have all had it at one stage. My old English teacher beat cancer time and time again, but not all are fortunate. I'd give up my life if it meant, I could save kids with cancer. It's just all a game too big pharma, all about money, we have the cures. The pharmaceutical companies would rather treat symptoms and make huge profits at the loss of human life.
Wow I cried over this song. This song is going to reach so many people. Tom you make amazing music to help uplift people and to encourage them. My dad is going through treatment right now, and I hope this song helps people to keep fighting the battle they are going through.
Definitely hits home..😭
Good job Tom and Nova! Keep calling them out! Stay safe!
I’m not gonna lie, I usually don’t really care about those who have cancer, I’m usually just like “oh well he/she/they died, that’s sad but ok” but I feel like I’ll only care when I find out a loved one is risked to having it
Infact, I have an episode on my channel that shows my good friend's picture, he even managed to be part of commentary, and created himself 2 characters for my show. One of which, was from his comic book art that he created. Even though, he would hurt a lot, he was such an amazing and inspiring friend to me. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. He helped me see, so much more in my personal life. He also helped me stay strong for him, and as a former wrestling fan, he wanted one more good show. And on that show, his characters were winners, I do believe and then, not long after that, he made his goodbye to the public, and it was so unbelievably powerful and sad all at the same time. Ima miss my bro Todd. The little time I got to hang out with him,and know him for who he was, will never be forgotten, and will always be cherished.
Thats why dont vote for Democrat. They love seeing people die. Go right all day everyday. GO TRUMP!!!
What a beautiful song. My father survived cancer twice and I recently got to interview him for a school project and I wish I could’ve played this song for him during the filming process.
Damn Tom I felt this in my soul
I am glad you made this bc I am one lucky kid who survived cancer
Wow this speaks volumes and music from you has inspired me and those around me .... ironically lost my father one year ago tomorrow from cancer and this dropped .... it’s the truth cancer has touched us all in some way and there’s no profit in the cure .... been speaking that for years ..... thanks Tom and keep bringing the fire 🔥 on the mic 🎤
This song is Amazing thank you bringing this to my ears this Morning. My grandmother and Dad died from Cancer
I know you'll never see this... but thank you. Thank you so much
my mom died last year. thanks for giveing me something to relate to.
You weren’t kidding when you said “bring the tissues” Another song about another tough topic done well. Keep on doing what you do, Tom, because you are doing it well and spreading more of what this world needs through your music. We love what you do and can’t wait to hear what’s next.
Again, you hit me with those lyrics. ❤️✨
The only reason anyone hits the thumbs down is they have too many tears to see clearly which is which.
wow Such a powerful Song and Msg. This one hit home, I sit here everyday fighting, its all I know how to do. the fire inside that makes you fight for that next day or year or whatever Lets you know you are still alive. I Pray for all that are fighting this same fight as I am. God Bless you Tom. such an amazing artist. Love ya Fam. #HOG_For_Life
my mom just passed away 2 years ago from lung liver kidney heart cancer led to her brain and i never got to say i love you and goodbye thank you for your music Tom and Nova ps still waiting to buy gfbf album love ya guys HANGOVERGANG FOR LIFE
This was absolutely beautiful! I'm still new at making reactions and reviews on YouTube but as soon as I saw you drop this and I saw what it was called I knew I had to do a video! I've lost several people myself in my family to cancer and my grandfather has been battling it on and off for a few years now and he's doing okay for the moment thank the good Lord. This song hit me right in the heart and I really appreciate it Tom!
I fuckin love you Tom
Great song, hits home with many reading this now, unfortunately some of us will get it. Let’s not HELP cancer get to us, stop smoking, chewing, snuff or whatever, please stay healthy for you and your family. I had to learn the hard way, I hate seeing others go through this struggle... it fuckin sucks, it cripples you and yours, the complications afterwards are just as bad, make many people realize what’s really important in our short lifetime. Thanks Tom, much respect
I always wondered who the people are or what they think about when they dislike videos like this.
10/10 that simple
Honestly some of the most meaningful rap lyrics since Tupac Dear Momma
Fucking beautiful! You got me crying.
This song had me crying hard as fuck. Grandmother died of leukemia and I myself am trying to overcome brain cancer. So this hit huge to me
the amount of people my family has lost to cancer is sickening and we all know they have a cure for it they make to much to cure people
Whoever is reading this, you're a fighter...
I have to say I was on the fence on whether or not I like this dude but I got to admit I put him in my rotation.
I recently beat stage 3B Cervical cancer!! Stay strong if you’ve been diagnosed 💪🏻
Amen brother I have a ma on her 3rd round of cancer this time she ain't winning. I know others that have fought it my wife even had skin cancer and won that so far. So thank you thank you for speaking the truth.
Sad that songs like WAP are popular on things like TikTok and not things with an actual decent message.
Great song keep doing you tom. For those who disliked this you need to get a life. Do some thing with your self instead of being a waste of space.
G.B.O.M.B.S. Greens, Beans, Onions, Mushrooms, Berries and Seeds all are anti cancer. Healthy food prevents, treats and cures all known cancers.
We have to protect Tom at all cost
My mom and my grandmother are survivor's,  this was incredible,  very emotional and all sadly true.
My bf is going through the motions right now to get diagnosed with bone cancer and let me tell you what, this shit is scary. So many tests, so much blood work, so many x-rays. All for what?
Appreciate the song, but cancer is so much more complicated than the cure.  Killing a part of you to save the rest of you, and while emotionally I think we can relate, physically it is hard to comprehend.  Then there are so many types that don't all act the same makes the path even more convoluted.  We have made progress, but until nanotech becomes mainstream I am not sure we will have a widespread treatment option with a high rate of success.  I do love the live life message because it doesn't have to be cancer that ends you... life is chaotic.
Damn Tommy... Hitting the head of the nail again!!! Like alot of things gov, tech, pharm', they get all this money and they don't want to lose it even if they found things to fix the PROBLEM.. So they keep it on the DL or price it way out of the reach!!! And on the other hand my dad dealt with colon cancer and beat it!!! Thanks for the vid!!
Bro! I've been feeling like I'm fighting this battle alone. No one's been talking to me, or coming around, ever since I stopped making videos. It's hard as hell to keep a positive attitude when on chemo and you're feeling like crap. Thanks for making this song. It means the WORLD!!! to me for sure.
I didn't know how strong minded it takes to survive anything life threatening. July 17th 2012 I survived a TBI. Relearning everything taught me so much as a human being. I know choose to be a light in a very dark world. Thanks Tom!
Fucking banger and inspirational! Great job man,
.
dam
im not crying. an beautiful Tom just beautiful
Beautiful I was diagnosed March 2015
Made it about half way through before I starting crying had to pull my car over hit way to close to home for me with this one. Simply amazing Tom
Powerful words. Thanks for speaking out about it Tom. You are a voice for these people, bless you for that.
Thank you Tom... I lost one of the most important people in my life to cancer this year... Yeah im crying like a bish watching this thinkin of her... R.i.p. momma Kathy.....
I was 15...met the first girl to ever give me the time of day...a genuine ray of sunshine in what felt like a dark, uncaring, cruel world that wouldn't accept me for being different, disabled...she befriended me freshman year of high School...that first year was wonderful..we watched tv, played games, went for walks, played with lego's, talked about life, and where we hoped it might take us..She had such a beautiful heart and soul and mind....And then Cancer took it all away....Over the next handful of years, I watched her deteriorate...I kept her company, visited often..but she was almost never in school..  She got weaker, and weaker, and weaker...and all I could think of was how something that was supposed to be helping her was leaving her weak..making her weaker...  The treatment to kill the cancer killed my friend before she'd even turned 17... And we've known there is a cure for much longer, but big pharma won't give up that canceroush cash-cow...  THey took an oath to "First, Do no Harm"....but if you don't have the money to stay in the hospital, you get put on hospice, where you don't get the treatment you need, or the care you need...then your money runs out and you have to watch your friend die because the greedy pieces of shit in the Doctor's office have decided that they are now a business, not a necessity, and they can now charge whatever the fuck they want for this, for that, for every life-saving thing, they'll upsell, charge a literal arm and leg for it, or a kidney...  My friend didn't have to die....nobody's loved ones need to die to Cancer...  Cannabinoids KILL CANCER, and they've known this for 60 GODDAMN YEARS.  FIGHT BACK. IT'S TIME. COLLECTIVELY! FIGHT BACK AGAINST BIG PHARMA! NOBODY DESERVES TO SUFFER CANCER...and nobody deserves to have to watch their loved ones die, knowing there's practically a cure right under our noses that the Government keeps from us because their big pharma donors want it that way...
Tom you hit it on the nail head I have lost friend grandparents and my mom has Ben fighting it for 5 years😢RIP to all how have goin HOG for ever from LA 😢👣
Yeah I've lost all my family too cancer. Our governments allow companies to kill us because they get kick backs from those companies. Im not sure about Canada but here in the united states the reasons being it takes so long to pass anything. All the crooked politicans fighting for the companies filling their pockets and people don't know any better and just accept it. Sad really
2012 my mom passed away just a week prior I told her she was going to be a grandma. I always have wondered how things would’ve been if she never had cancer. 2005 she was Diagnosed with cervical cancer. I was 15 my little brother was ten that’s when our lives changed for ever and didn’t have a clue at that time. Our family was not perfect by know means dad was/is a carpenter mom was a Waffle House waitress so we was not rich but we were ok. With Mom getting chemo and radiation treatments she was to sick to work so now it was all up to my dad to take care of the bills. After passing the 9th great that summer I got a job paint house to help my dad out but he wouldn’t take any money just told me it was a big help that I could pay my way, so I didn’t go back to school I just could help as much as I possibly could with my mom but things got to the point were she was spending more time at the hospital then at home so I would stay with her at the hospital long story short cause I could write a book about how cancer can destroy a household .  Now I’m 31 married and four beautiful daughters and I’m scared to death or cancer cause I never want to put my family what my father brother and I went through
Wow I loved this ❤️ why do we spend so much to fight cancer if people are donating to it like where tf is that money going to use it to help the people who can’t pay for the treatment
THANK YOU FOR THIS! My dad lost his battle to cancer, he was only 48 years old. It was the hardest thing I've ever been through.  My sister had a tumor on her brain a couple months  ago (they were able to remove it).  My health is not great, I've had open heart surgery 5 years ago,  and I'm o ly 39 years old, and things get scary in life, and I worry about what might happen next? Cancer is so horrible, but my dad fought, he fought hard, and I miss him more than words can explain. It makes me angry that they didn't do more for him.....but, this song is beautiful, and it helps. Thank you Tom. Thank you for all your songs, and now this one is my favorite from you. To everybody fighting, going through, went through, held someone's hand , or lost someone to cancer,  I believe that tom is right, there has got to be a cure, and I hope it finds you. "You dont know peace, till you've had suffering". Best wishes to all....
Love you Tom been a fan since you released that song about gun control and what not your music continues to shed light on alot of topics people are afraid of speaking about. Thank you for creating the music you create it's so uplifting and not once have you sold out on you're fans the stuff you put out helps many people like myself who deal with day to day struggles and mental illness.
Great work again guys!!! The human experience, defeating all of the hardships of life and the beauty that the struggle exposes. Beautiful to be a part of what you guys do...and to live!
That was incredible. I love you Tom. This was one of your best yet. H.O.G. 4ever
As always song and video are on point bud. Love it 100% keep doing your thing!
You’re a Fighter ❤️✊
Literally the greatest rapper of our generation. The most heartfelt song I know right now. Much love to you.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 like always.
This is very heart touching i have lost both of my grandmothers before i even got to meet them or get to know them well and this still make me sad because i believe there is a cure for cancer even though some don't but if no one knew this what about the Research that came from a university in the state that they find a chemical combination that actually shrinks tumors 3 times their size well damn you would think that would be good right but according to FDA Said no because the chemicals used were not FDA sertifyied (spelling error) so the University had to buy legal terms destroy everything involve with it including the recipe for the chemical compound that so called shrinked  tumors so yeah this speaks the truth the system and doctors and every body doesn't truly care as long as they get paid what is the greatest evil in society money and greed will be the cause of the fail of are society so i hope for the better this changes but it probably won't sadly
I took my best friend to every Treatment, in 6 months I watched a strong man grow weak. It spread to his brain, "Im dizzy", That was the last text I got from him in hospice. He told me that he would watch over me when he goes. It was an hour after that I arrived to hospice and he was gone. Because he had no insurance they missed several things and he could have been here. I watched him in 6 months become more wise then most in their whole Lives. As always Tom. Great Video  Edit: Thanks to all the people who responded to my story, However mine is not unique. I wish it was. I truly belueve Tom is right when he says we just cant end it. Money is the root of THIS evil. God Bless.
I have to say . I always thought there was a cure from time ago. As i thought it was man made from the start. Just my thoughts. Not to judge anything
Lost my Uncle this year in the month of February because of Cancer. He was the best Uncle and a jolly good fellow, it breaks my heart everytime I remember him.❤
This song really hit home to me as i lost my 196om to cancer on March 19th of this year, Thank you Tom for showing the true feelings of the  family members and the person suffering from this awful disease, God Bless you  and Nova
Good message ❤
Try Jesus
That’s beautiful, Brother. My Brother’s mother-in-law had cancer and beat it a few years back but they lost her last month after a long time of illness. I know this song will touch many. Keep doing what you’re doing. Much Love and mad respect ✊
They will never release the cure. They make more money keeping us sick.
I cannot describe what this means to my family, to me, and so many out there. I've lost so many to cancer and watching them battle cancer is the biggest war I've seen. This song is just outstanding ❤️
We need someone like Tom Macdonald for president.  Tom Macdonald 2020
Thank you so much for this song Tom. It is going to help so many people and touch alot of lives.  I loved it the minute I heard it off the album. I bawled like a baby then and to this video. I lost my mother to cancer 4 years ago and still struggle with it till this day. Your music has helped me through so much in my life. From a 13 year opiate addiction to loosing my mom. You and Nova are the best! I just want to say thank you! I am hang over gang for life! Love you guys!
My mom just found a large lump in her left breast a few days ago, so how ironic you release this video today. Both my grandmother's beat breast cancer, along with my aunt but I lost 2 uncles to cancer. Our family is no stranger to this God awful disease, and now the scare is back with my mom. Thank you Tom, for once again exposing the truth in an industry that's corrupt, and there are so many aren't there? But the medicinal industry literally kills us, at a time we're fighting hardest to live! So much love to you, as always! HOG4LIFE 😎😍
This is amazing tom thanks man.
This is by far the hardest hitting song yet. So much truth and yet people still wanna sleep through it all. Just like this plandemic. They haven't isolated the so called c 19 strain scientifically or medically, because you can't isolate something that don't exist. Why do you think they have been pushing the flu shot for a couple months now? Because that is the only way they can get a positive test result. That's all they are testing for, the flu. Just like cancer, my stepdad had it, my aunt has it. It's all in the poison we ingest everyday. Including their so called vaccines. My daughter almost had to have a liver transplant due to a vaccine. People need to wake up and question everything, don't do what your told, you're not a slave right? Quit letting these elites, governments run and ruin our lives. If we don't stand together now my friends we don't have but a very very short time before they take this plandemic and go to the next level. Which will be the result I'm afraid. Millions upon millions of deaths will be the result. Don't take anymore shots from the words of these people and I promise you will see you don't need them.
❤️ Love u Tom Macdonald. 🤗
That's so strong man every line hit me and motivated me, you made my hell a better place thanks Tom
Good song man
❤️
The government has had a cure for years.
This hit hard ... Thank you Tom ❤❤❤
Rip
Bravo, Tom!!! Brought me a smile, thanks for this
Man Tom, you are the only one talking about REAL problems. You are empowering a lot of people and making them feel like they have a chance. Literally every other rapper just talks about drugs, violence and money thinking they are cool but they are really just sleeping in their cute little worlds they’ve created. You sir are an amazing person. Wish I knew someone like you in real life, much love brother.
Speeking the truth .. love your music so glad I have you to listen to when I need a pick me up .
I've had cancer and fight it everyday!  It will not take me!  I am happy to have met you and Nova and it means the world to me you think of your fans! And yes,  they have the cure!
Damn bro your to real GOD BLESS YOU MY BROTHER  can't hold back the tears of truth
Love it tom keep on your right what you said on your Instagram post
There is significantly more money in treatment than a cure. It's messed up and sad. Tom is always 💯 % 🔥
Rip Linda
That's a beautiful song made me sad
Brilliant! Thank you for this, definitely going to help alot of people! To everyone that has cancer, just know you have my prayers with all of us in the world even if you know or do not.
This hits the heart so hard lost a freind at 24yrs old of brain cancer and now my mother is fighting stage 4 lung cancer
Even if it's a song about cancer this kind of reflects my depression and I love it we can make it  EDIT: my great grandma also died of breast cancer in 2007 when I was 3months old
Well I for one know where I'm going when I die and that place is called heaven and that's for sure. God bless all who read this and may you find jesus if you don't already know him to be your savior. 😇😇😇
Man another great song!!! Brother I love your music and I’ve got mad respect for you. BTW I’m a cancer survivor.🤘🔥💯
The realist song ever made💯
Damn, you weren't kidding when you said we were gonna cry. This song's awesome. I also wanted to say, I'm not that religious but I grew up in a Mormon home. This would take forever to explain what we believe what happens in the afterlife but if you are battling any kind of sickness right now. I promise no matter what happens, you will be okay. You are strong no matter what happens.
Wow! This is deep and definitely hits home. My dad was diagnosed with cancer last year. Fortunately my dad is still alive and doing well.  Thank you Tom! ✌️👍👍🙏
💖You don't know what you can take until you realize that you didn't break 💖
Ugly crying and covered in goose bumps ❤️❤️❤️ your amazing
It's Sad that songs like this don't get more attention...    but WAP is sitting on top of the charts 😌
You can really see the emotion in your eyes, fucking powerful man... damn
My dad died of cancer when I was in high school.  Thank you for this it really hit home.
Damn this touched my heart, i lost my dad to cancer, it did not just effects the person that has it but the entire family too
I'm just gonna leave this here. How PET/CT’s Work: The PET/CT study involves having the patient fast before their scan and then get an injection of this radioactive sugar. They are then asked to sit in the waiting room for about an hour, giving time for the sugar to circulate around the body and be gobbled up by hungry cancer cells. Sugar is the #1 food cancer cells prefer to eat, so they load up on this 18-FDG like a kid in a candy store. Then the patient is brought back to the PET/CT scanner and are scanned from head to toe. Anywhere the sugar accumulates (i.e. cancerous tumors) shows up like a light bulb on the scan. https://integrativeoncology-essentials.com/2014/01/cancer-loves-sugar/
i lost my mom to cancer 3 yrs ago the insurance company fought her on the treatment for a month then the day she was to start chemo she went into the icu and never made it out
My pops pasted 6 years ago from this shit
Terrible song good message
I think we all needed this tom thank you for this man. With all the respect and love that I have
Thank you tom I've personally never lost anyone close to me from cancer. But I've had friends commit suicide because they lost someone to it.
Hey bro this one hits close to home. My mom is a survivor, also a huge fan of yours. Thank you for this one. She loved it
Tom you are best rapper alive right now keep up the great work
My mom's parents (grandma and grandpa, married to each other) BOTH got cancer bruh.   The grandpa did EVERYTHING the doctors said to do and wrote notes about the treatment. They gave him 6 months. He fought for a year and still passed away anyways. RIP Richard. His notes were so detailed that the doctors requested to submit them to the Canada government for "research."   The grandma got cancer and only did Kemo-therapy and is still living to this day. :/
Leave it to Tom to speak the truth and things we are all thinking.  Hell yeah amazing song as always.
Awesome!!  You the Man Tom. This going to reach a lot of people!!  Thanks Man!!
I have no words for this song, but thank you. My uncle passed away 2 weeks ago from Hodgkins lymphoma, so this is a little hard to watch. But thank you for another amazing song
Tom just spoke so much truth in this song. He is too talented and so aware of the shit that is going on in the world and he just wants to bring joy to everyone who are struggling right now. So glad to hear this. Thank you Tom and keep doing your thing!
Thank you for this, its about time someone did this its going to help people. I do believe they have a cure for cancer but keeping it from everyone, unless your rich
I thought you where talking about haters was going to cry . That's the most touching song I've heard from you. still 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you Tom.
So many feeling,so many true in this words.🙏 Thanks Tom 👍 HOG 4life
Wow. Thank you Tom. I wish my little girl could have heard this song. She would have absolutely loved it. Her name is Natalie. She was 9 when we lost her to brain cancer. She fought for 2 years. Thru 2 brain surgeries. She was so incredibly strong and brave. I miss her every second of every day. We did so much research, with so many sleepless nights. Unfortunately, it is like a business. I wish things were different. I hope one day, that things are. Anybody out there either battling themselves or for a loved one, I'm so sorry you have to deal with this. Stay strong and fight as much as you can. Much love to all of you.
🔥
You know whut lowering people  or sad thc for making this video because  my grandma had it but this bro for making this video
Another emotional banger.  This hits hard
Literally your most powerful song, very well done.
This is the inspiration the world needs your the best Tom
i know one thing if i was the one that finally made the cure , id never tell anyone but id save everyone for free... just run around giving people the shot the pills  how ever the cure surfaces...it only the right thing to do i don't need money not rich but i don't care the less money you have make realize money don't the man , the caring and giving to others and knowing you did the right thing..
My husband has cancer
My 15 year old girl cat is just recovering from mammary gland cancer surgery and needs to be cut at least one more time.
How can anyone actually dislike this song?
Thanks for this Tom my dad just passed away in February from lung cancer and it progressed to his brain. It really really hits home also hits home because me and him didn’t have the best relationship but he tried to in the end.  It sickens me that unless you have the money or are important enough you can’t be cured. Look at COVID.. Trump was just diagnosed and that same day was treated and had every possible helping agent handed to him and now look he’s walking around in good health....
I listened to the this song many times off Gravestones album and the music video hit me harder. Thinking about my brother my family lost 2 Christmas ago. Tom Macdonald is smashing the industry with his words. Thank you Tom. RIP Art😭💜
For cancer awareness I grow my hairout every year multiple times. Than shave it bald.
Thank you for this Tom ❤️
Just started my 4th week of radiation ❤  So many truths in this song. Thank you!!
my mom had stage 4 breast cancer and had like a 1% chance to live but luckily she made it. we love u tom. hang over gang forever
i was only 25 when i was my mother's caregiver when she had long cancer. it took six months for the cemo to rot her body away. she would brooze just sleeping to long on one side. i don't think there are words to express how fucked up it was and it breaks my heart that the only way some one else would know is to experience themselves. you want people to understand so you can get it off your chest but could never face some one else that has experienced it. so even after 10 years i carry this horribleness around with me never once repeating the horrible details just to protect people and myself from from what i have seen.
Good job man
Thank you for using your clout for something other than talking about sex, violence, drugs, fame, and money.❤️
Damn, bro, you went way deep on this one,  way deep !!! Keep up turning out the truth. Love your work Tom.
Putting the statistics up at the end would of been a nice stamp ending. This is a great song that will help so many people. Love what you do Tom & Nova
Love sent to all victims and family.
damn tom this is my new fav song love you bro keep up the good work
Keep saying the shit that matters my friend. Nobody else is that brave!
Great song bro.
You are one of the most eclectic artist out right now good sir, keep making the hits! This is a strong message and I hope it helps a lot of people through hard times. ✊🏼 respect
Tears drops
damn had me in tears ngl💗
Thank you Tom, I am a survivor and the treatment leaves you with life long side effects, they are horrible but I'm here to cook banana bread with my G Baby and get to raise a beautiful 8 year old girl so it is all worth it. The treatment almost killed me, but the old ladies at the Hope Lodge treated me like their grand child,, I would love to thank them all.
Once again you’ve done it again!! So true!! Government has a cue!! They would loose so much money if they provided a cue! What a sad , sick society we live in.
There has to be a cure for cancer that the government is hiding so doctors and  big pharma can make billions off the sick and dying.
This hit me hard man. Ty for speaking truth about this real pandemic. God bless you Tom! 👊
Interesting piece
IM NOT CRYING YOURE CRYING!!
Big Pharma are the biggest lobbyists in the US... More than double even oil companies, etc.
You wild for talking about this. Keep going g
Simple put Tom is a modern day prophet to teach us our own truths we have gotten to blind to see. A man can still spread the truth of our own existence.
By far your best song man.  This is going to be an anthem for a lot of people.
Wow amazing...I said on Facebook also but I take care of my special needs sister and she had stage three breast cancer and what a fighter she is she is so amazing she's an example to us all and this song touches me in such a way I can't even begin to express thank you for all your hard work.
My sister is battling as I type this. I'm not an emotional person, but you teared me up with the hook and chorus. Thank you bro. I'm calling her right now to tell her how much I love her.
This song is amazing and what I needed to hear today thank you ❤️
Damn
this hits hard my mom is dying of her second round of cancer rn and doesnt have long left to live and she lives 10 hours away from of me bc of what happened when i was younger and it sucks
This is a sad song and I have listened to the whole album, gravestones. I knew this was coming, a beautiful but sad song. Unfortunately for me, I know this through losing my 20 year old cousin who fought chemo twice. And my good friend who was like a little brother, who survived first time by having his leg amputated. The second time, he wasn't so lucky. But he was so full of life and even though he wasn't well, he was stronger than me and I'm not ashamed to admit that. Thank you for such a great song.
This is so true where does all the money go, there is a cure but they don’t want us to know as the result is over population and the government having to spend more on pensions etc
You can't hate tom
wow.
Fuck tom and nova you did it right you keep it going. you guys have what it takes to be free. I love you two, tom you are a good brother, nova you and a good sister. you 2  must show the world through your music that the truth is coming soon .its going to happen. you and everyone that you have spoken to is involved in the truth. you 2 have gave so many people the ability to open there eyes and hart to find the truth. Never forget where you 2 came from. God bless you and all that who sees the future. Q,ya just remember the future has not been written yet. You remember the day it rest . it was the day you and nova
Damn you Tom!! You made me cry again!!
I’m a new fan just stumbled onto your videos  about a.month ago and I got HOOKED! I’ve probably watched each of your videos at least 30 times. Love it brother only wish I’d found you sooner.
I see a lot of people saying how this hits home, yet people rather be rioting and looting over black lives... why haven't people busted into a courthouse armed to the teeth yet over equal medical treatment or affordable housing for everyone? Dumbasses did it to end lockdown... Priorities be fucked yall
Thank you Tom and Nova
Lost my grandma when. I was about 7years old to lung cancer and 15 years later im 22 almoust 23 now and just lost my grand pa to lung cancer aswel about a year ago this one hits hard i love this so so much i started crying 😢 i wish everyone going true this well and all the family’s that are heartbroken your not alone we stand together and  mourn together ❤️❤️❤️
One of the best songs ever written 😌
Trash. Even the choruses suck.
Honestly, thank you for this Tom.  Thank you so much.
I lost my Mother last year to Colon cancer! She was healthy one minute woke up from a nap one day with a lump & deteriorated from then on! She wasn’t a perfect person but nobody deserves to feel & look like she did the last time I got to see her. She looked like a holocaust victim extremely frail I was scared to touch her but I layed there by her side like I did as a child the weekend before she passed.
Tom your words are very powerful. God gave you a gift. No one is right or wrong in God's eyes.   But you put the words out there like a sword. To pierce a heart.   God bless you with knowledge all I can tell you is be you, do you.  Thank you for sharing that. God bless you and Nova y'all do an excellent job. God bless 😢😢😢😢💘
Thank you so much for this song! I'm a cancer survivor and it REALLY resignated with me. You said everything I feel and have felt not just throughout my cancer journey but also today, as a 7 year breast cancer survivor. Again thank you for making a song that speaks my truth ❤
Thank you for this.. ♥️
You were right, Tom. This made me cry. You're incredible, sir. Thank you for this.
Amazing song!
Man Tom you got me on this one, my brother has stage 4, I tell him every time i talk to him to stay strong.
I needed this thanks! Cancer is the true pandemic. We need to focus our  vaccine efforts towards a cure for cancer.
Hits the soul hard..yet another amazing song..youre doin amazing youve came up so much from the beginning proud of you man🔥💪💯
Those who disliked this vedio  might be they don't have brain  or ears 💯💯
Damn Tom, talk about a song that will bring your fans to tears. We all know someone or maybe are that someone battling with this disease, so many of us needed to hear this song. Thank you for this.
Thank you this means a lot I've had a couple family members pass from cancer.
Great words... facts
I lost my best friend to cancer 10 years ago. This definitely hits home.. my little cousin had bone cancer and she beat it thank the lord
Amen!! I have family w/cancer & have a great  possibility in getting it myself. But I try to stay healthy, positive and strong.  Love this.. #YOUROCKTOM #FUCKYA
Thank you, Tom. Thank you so much.. my dad died from cancer on the 28th of March in 2018.. we both loved your music and he and I would sit in his hospital room listening to your songs.. thank you so much for this..
Worst part of cancer is watching both yourself n people you love. Watched 5 people go thru cancer n none survived it. Growing up seeing person after person u love go thru it stays with you long time. 🥺
Over the last 10 years I’ve lost my mum , my grandmother , my auntie & one of my best friends to Cancer... It makes me angry but it won’t control me .. I carry on everyday for my wife & kids ...  You Tom are a real one   👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻
It's hard to listen to it because I lost my grandpa on 98 from colon cancer man I wish he could have fought harder but the doctors only gave him 2 weeks he lived 2 weeks and 1 day passed away on his birthday
God Bless Tom McDonald and all suffering.
Thanks brother, lost my father 3 years ago to brain cancer and mother 8 years ago to MS.
Tom you are a prophet and we love you brother! Keep telling the truth
@tommacdonald.  Man so many emotions right now from this song.  My uncle who has three kids who is 41 in a couple days is battling stage 4 cancer and was hospitalized 3 days ago.  Appreciate you man.  Needed this and will be passing it on.  Keep up the good work!
Wow Bro that was moving and I loved the placement of the Lyrics Shakespeare said “brevity is the soul of Genius” to be able to say so much in a short condensed song. You guys have a powerful gift & with great power comes great responsibility! I believe that you guys are impacting people in great ways, an i tire Forrest starts with a single seed!
I wish kids with cancer good luck hope they beat cancer
I have no words other than thank you for this. I am a 24 yr colon cancer survivor I'm 44 now. Your words hit to the core. Awesome song. Over the years I've been asked how did you keep pushing? This song you made is on point! Keep doing what you do thank you 💯💯🔥🔥
Tear jerker. Just lost my aunt to cancer.  She knew the treatment was killing her, because she's a nurse.
Bro, there are no words....👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
The medical community has a lot of flaws that we can discuss, but to say that they have a cure for cancer and that they refuse to use/release it is dangerous, ignorant, misleading, and dishonest.  If you don't care to learn about the complexities of cancer (metaphorical or not) then please refrain from propagandizing your own lack of misinformation.
they want all our money before we die
Just lost my brother to cancer last month. This hits really hard on the heart. 😞
they were bullying into an Esophogectomy, after 25 days radiation to shrink to make it easier for doc to butcher me.  wich would of ruined my last days. I acted like i was going for surgery, to reviece the chemo/ radiation. they told me if i didnt get the surgery, i would be on feeding tubes in months giving me 3 to 12 months...... i rufused the surgery!!!  so far gained back all my wieght back, eating great.....it felt wrong to munipulate my body that extreme in hopes to live a little longer...turned my will over to the care of God. i actually fealt special i was being pulled Home early, ultimatley God had other plans...strong n healthy  n most important spiritualy connected... Straight up, the Cancer has been a blessing in my life. my family needed my Cancer to love me again.....I just celibrated 6 years clean n sober september 23rd..... I said Goodbye to everyone on my 5th year, cuddled by Christ, looking foward to the upcoming supposed End.....God...well He just loves me.... decided to give me more tasks of this World
Bro this just made me emotional damn good video 👍
Speaking so many truths in your lyrics. Keep up the good work. So glad i was introduced to your music.
Keep telling em.
In under a year my 80 year old dad has beat two different types of cancer.  This is dedicated to the Elaine Roberts Foundation, just another teen who lost the battle, a statistic. She’s also a beloved friend, amazing kind and generous person, someone everyone could look up to; Elaine, Thompson High School in Alabaster, AL. Give to the Elaine Roberts Foundation to cure childhood cancer, started by her mom and friends.
This song is beautiful man for real it shows so much emotion from you as an artist and also to the fans who I know feel this track stay strong guys...keep up the killer work dude the video is amazing 🤙🏼
Amazing dude, gives me chills
Wow Thank you
Now think about all the suffering children that have had cancer and died, not to mention all the other people too (adults, relatives, etc). This is a war against humanity. And the f#ckers who have had the cure and refused to release it and even murdered other doctors and scientists to cover it up. This is genocide. Crimes against humanity. I hope everyone complicit gets held accountable and suffers a long torturous death like they deserve, just like they instilled on all those innocent children.
I had cancer at the age of 24, 30 years old now and this hits home. Im cancer free and just had a son, thank God things turned around but im absolutely convinced they have a cure and just dont want to lose the money they make from those who they infect. Powerful song
I like it. So fucking true.
Lost my sister and my dad 23 days apart in 2013 to cancer.  This song hits so hart it hurts
Healthcare should not be for profit
Yeah so many people affected. To much cost and profit to end it. Shine that light on it.
I’m literally in tears. I’ve known too many that have fought this beast and some that lost. You never cease to amaze with bringing the truth!! Keep doing your thing Tom we love you!!!
Damn dude
Sigh. This video gets a like..though heartbreaking . I have cancer running through my maternal family...and have been concerned all my adult life...only to have my husband struggle to survive 9 years before cancer won. Hundreds of thousands of dollars  of unpayable bill for most families.
I really hope this song catches on and goes viral. People need to hear it. Thank you Tom!!!
You did it again Tom. Perfect.
Beautiful and powerful, amazing song
Before my grandfather died had a quite a bit of heart transplants and level 4 diabetes. Love that man and miss him
As a person that will inevitably probably get cancer due to family history i approve of this message. Love your work my g keep it up.👍
lost both my parents to this decease they both fought it but lost the battle and this song really hit home made me sad but its really good love your music Tom even when it hit me home respect to you .
Speaking the truth, great song! Stay strong if ya have Cancer!!
My mom had breast cancer  and had to have them removed. My wife has MS and their is no cure for that either. I have a bone disease and their is no cure for me either. This song hits my family real hard so thank you for this awesome song @TomMacDonald
🥺🥺🥺♥️♥️♥️
Tom ANOTHER  GREAT song!  Great Message.bro..
this made me cry. I couldn't imagine either one of my babies getting this terrible disease .
Cancer sucks!! My daddy will never be the same guy again after losing his wife last year.  I e watched a friend younger than me slip away completely in only one year on daily Facebook updates,, and watched a friend lose her little girl and become a completely broken person... Cancer is terrifying to me because there's no measures to prevent it, and it doesn't discriminate.  All we can do is keep ourselves and our loved ones covered in prayer at all times. God please give us a cure for this... thanks Tom, for addressing it...
Facts bro🔥🔥🔥
Tom❤️❤️❤️
It's Bad song haha
This hit home so much, my Mom past away on the 2nd of May 2020 from Cancer. Thank you for making this song Tom.❤
They killed the man who can cured cancer. And thanks for this Tom. Two of my father's sister just died because of cancer 😭😭😭
Well .. let tha truth be told .. great song G 🔥💪💯
Damn Tom... Well done Sir.
That was powerful bro, I lost my mom and dad both to cancer in 2015. Yes, both in the same year. That song hit me right at home. You're the man dog, love all yours, and Nova's shit !!!
Tom your awesome! That was my wish. I wish cancer had a cure!
Thank you brother, just thank you 🖤🤘
Thank you brother. This song means the most. Lost my father and grandpa to cancer. It's honestly unfair and it don't make sense why they haven't cured it ether
My grandma is dealing with it now.
Oof, c'mon cancer is a by product of cells not having an end date or expiration It's essentially a breakdown of cellular structure which could be caused by just about anything... Blame the radiation from the sun, and the human genome for the difficulty... Oy ... OY
Fire track! As always a nice message! Big fan !greetings from Germany bro!
I see ya got that Mark Hoppus hook goin on 👌
At work just got a chance listen thank you for this song my uncle just past yesterday to cancer
🌼🤗🌻😇💖
I’m not saying I’m a fan, but I’ll stop hating on this guy. He focuses on some really important topics.
Damn bruh no one not one soul on this beautiful planet coulda said it better I've been listening  to your art for only a short time the first I heard was I hate hip hop the title caught my eye because I'm not a fan of much hip hop or rap untill I heard your music your art hit a light on I listened to the old rap like the late 80s into the 90s type ll n naught by nature shit Tupac biggie I loved that because it's real shit real life real pain n emotion real art real truth in their music and your music tom took me back and opened a new door and it's because of the truth n courage n emotions n pain it's real as real is an brutally honest I honestly have never in my 40 years here have been moved n lifted by any music until tom macdonald thank you brotha mad love to ya n much respect thank you I'm so grateful and honestly blessed to have had a opportunity to have experienced listening to an artist like yourself  it be awesome really to meet ya one day n talk bout life I'd love to go to a show and would I dont believe there will be live shows for much longer this world is wacked [ut anywho thanks again brother keep it real much love peace out
You win i cried
I appreciate this song so much cause I'm a 31 year survivor of cancer. I had kidney cancer when I was 2 months old and my left kidney was removed. This song made me cry cause I am a survivor of cancer. My grandma also died from breast cancer when I was in my early 20s.  #FuckCancer #HOG
Man this hit hard man one of my favorite songs yet man keep doin this shit man u are one of the realist artist out now fr
Wow this hits home. My dad has passed from Cancer so has a few others I know. Thank you for putting this out.
Another great song with so much meaning an truth “hangovergang” keep doing your thing
...like a baby.
There's a Cure. They are Selfish. They are Evil. Because of Money. God Bless Us All.                🖤
Realist shit ive heard man 🔥🔥 keep spitting that 🔥 That TRUTH  thats 💯💯💯 #fuckcancer
The deck is stacked against us. Why would Pharma create a cure when they make a fortune off of treatments and maintenance drugs? And why would Hospitals encourage doctors to offer more effective or quicker alternatives when they've already invested in all that expensive equipment and staff?
Ok. Ya got me! I thought I wouldn't tear up, but I did!
This is a great one. We just found out my dad has cancer and has been doing treatments for about 2 weeks. He just lost all his hair and he's taking it pretty hard. Thank you for the encouragement.
this song hits home for me and is very painful. I lost my mother and grandmother 6 months apart from each other in the same year to cancer. My Mother and My dads Mother in the same year. so both sides of my family.  So many things can cause cancer. For us we believe it was water pollution in our home town. we cant prove it though. Its sad that just about everyone has lost someone to cancer. Covid kills a small number of people. No mater how unfair and painful those deaths are cancer is so much worse. Nations shut things down over covid and ignore cancer. Yes I know they are vastly different. Cancer is not contagious, however its much more deadly and serious and pervasive. No real investigations make the news enough to change anything. we keep eating, drinking and breathing Poison and its literally killing people. I cant express in words how painful it is and how offensive pink ribbons are to me. I snapped one day when I seen a pink trash can by the road! Yes a Pink breast cancer awareness trash can! A TRASH CAN!!! I almost stopped and went to there door to scream at them how Offensive that is! But self control won out that day. Not long after I was at the store in the Office stuff area and saw Pink Bubble wrap for packaging. All this awareness crap is a Joke! We are all Aware! It does nothing to change the poisons in our food, air and water! Its a psy-op to make us feel like we are doing something! I get so mad when I see ribbons for cancer! I want to rip them off of people and scream at them. But those same people just dont get it. they dont realize they are brainwashed. Screaming at them would do nothing to change the way things are.  Thank you for the song Tom! You are one of many who are trying to wake people up and that matters to me! <3
I lost my Maria in 2010! I love you baby! I'm living my best life for you baby!
Great great great
9 years ago this December since I lost my Big Brother and it still kills me. This was Beautiful Tom 💯💓
As someone who has lost an arm to cancer, I love that you've made this song. Keep up the good work!
I really felt this song.. beautiful soul you are.. you're inspiring so many people..Thank you for that.. means alot ... Thank you Tom and Nova for never giving up on one another... ✌ ☮ 🌸🦋
Tom, I love your content, but as a medical student I have to disagree with your comments about how there is a cure. Cancer is so hard to beat because it is not a singular disease. Everyone's cancer is unique to them, and is based on which mutations happened to their cells. It is impossible to create a single drug which can treat every type of mutation that exists. We can create therapies that target an individual's specific mutation, but it is still experimental becuase everyone's immune system reacts differently.  Cancer does not come about overnight. It is the accumulation of thousands of cell cycles, mutations, and DNA repairs until eventually one mutation pushes it over the edge and the cellular checkpoints can't stop growth anymore. It is always a race to the finish where doctors are late to the starting line. The rest of your song and video were powerful statements, and I thank you for them. Please understand that us in the medical community are doing whatever we can to make cancer disappear forever, but it is a near impossible task. Thanks for what you do Tom. Keep on making great music!
It's a beautiful song. My husband has lost his whole family to lung cancer. My mother had breast cancer and is still alive 20 yrs later. It gives ppl hope and it's touching and inspiring words. Thanks Tom . We will share this song everywhere on social media.
I went teary cause I lost so many to cancer. I found the strength to watch, I glad I did. Thank you. And thank you for sharing and showing awareness 🙏 ❤
Imagine being one of the people that would downvoted this.
my uncle died last year on Cancer...
Tom is the best because he always speaks the truth only reason why he so unheard of is because all people care about is a beat money drugs and cars and girls not a song that has meaning to it we need more people like Tom and Ryan upchurch
You 127 dislikes are probably not good people.
@Tom McDonald My dad died from bone cancer. While he had it I did a lot of research and found there is a cure for 99.9% of all cancer. The reason it's not given to anyone is because " If the cure to it was given EVERY medical holder would lose billions of dollars over night! And they are the ones causing us too get ALL these illnesses just to line their pockets!"
You're always putting out the best songs I've ever heard. This one is a new favorite. I've lost two great grandparents, a grandpap, several uncles and great uncles, great aunts to cancer. My nana and other grandad are battling cancer. My fiance lost his uncle (his best friend in the world), and grandparents to it. Cancer affects literally everyone i know so this song I think will be able to help people everywhere 💕💕💕💕💕 I love you so much Tom keep being amazing
Another health problem thg at is like this, but no one notices as much a cancer, is type 2 diabetes! Most people think that those who have type 2 do it to themselves. But think about it. Why are more and more Americans ending up with it when they eat well and exercise?! That's how I got it! Both my parents have it and had it my whole life! So, I knew what NOT to eat and what NOT to do, yet all 3 of my older siblings and I ALL have it now! And its killing me! I love the picture this video is showing! I wish someone would do the same for diabetes! It is a BIG killer
I lost my mom due to cancer 4 years ago. Great song!!! Love your music keep it up!!
I love tom macdonald he keeps it so real it the truth why cure something when they more money keeping us sick the world we live in is so f'ed up
Love this Comment section ❤️❤️❤️
Finally somebody speaks the truth without holding it back and stand up for us
This song really hits me hard my husband just died in July of colon cancer.  Thank you very much for bringing this to people attention. Keep up changing the world.
Solid
I lost my mom to cancer when I was 16..we lost everything trying to save her. For those goin through this fight,  stay strong and stay together. You only have each other
I can't stop tearing up , I lost my uncle to cancer in March .R.I.P
It does hav a curse.  There a patent on it
WOW!! 😭😭😭😭😭
finally real tom mac donald
If you’d like info on RSO or you’d like to get some let me know.
Only rapper that raps for his fans. Your outlook on life is awesome and thankful you put it into music!
Don’t take this the wrong way brother but this is the best track you’ve ever done.  I say this only because of its message and meaning.  How powerful it is.  You are saying what so many others think and say but nobody listens.  You used your own platform to speak for millions.  For that I salute you Tom McDonald.
I lost my Mother to cancer.
Grandpa died from cancer in 2010 this hit me hard thanks tom
My father was a Vietnam vet. My and my brother took care of him for 10+ years. Got him to quit smoking and eating junk food.  He  had all sorts of medical problems. One of them was cancer.  Then he passed away from either  Chemo,Radiation. At end it was  Heart failure.  It truly funkin sucked watching my father weather away.   Great Video  Take Care  Be Safe  Stay Safe
Great,its so underrated

Loved the song b4 the video !! But seriously thank you man , it’s a breath of fresh air to hear the truth and to realize there are people who are write music about real life situations and struggles of the regular person .
Thanks for this My foster sister's grandma has cancer in multiple parts of her body...and has a very small chance of surviving, 2 years at the least, 5 at the most...i just met this lady not even a year ago, but i feel like she has been in my life since i was born, i can't imagine a world without her tbh...if it wasn't for her, i wouldn't have been blessed with the best baby sister in the world
Awesome vid...but you CAN know where you're goin when you die.
Damn Shit got deep quick.
Oh wow!!  That’s incredible. Thank you Tom for teaching to touch lives. And thank you to all who face the battle of cancer, God loves you and is telling YOUR story 💖 if you have cancer don’t give up hope, you are an inspiration and reminder of strength and love to those around you!  And Tom yes I did cry 😂
"Its scary cause we don't know where we go when we die."  💕😢  just got news today that my grandma's cancer is back.  You speak the truth. Thank you for sharing it with us.

That was amazing.. Thank you for making this song, not just for me as a survivor, but for all of us who have fought and won, fought and lost, and those who continued on with holes in our hearts for the ones we have lost.. I have lost 2 that i care about to cancer, and i still look back on my dear friends and smile thinking of them and cry some. When i first heard this song on your CD, i cried because i knew this was going to be a major issue with you, and you would eventually make a music video for it.. Thank you thank you thank you for doing this.. I wish I could give you , Nova and the new guy a hug, I really hope  people pay attention to the message you are trying to send and wake up..

Bleh he was right. I cried. I’ve had quite a few family members pass of diff types of cancer. :(  Great job Tom.  You’ve made me feel inspired, fearless, like a kid with ur songs and now sad. What an artist.  Ahhh!  I wish cancer would die. Literally.
Anyone else get emotional?
this man talks to much facts 💔
Man.....you never cease to amaze me with the depth of the songs you create. Truly talented ,fan for life.
RIP Grandpa, Miss you 🙏   Thank you Tom for always keeping it REAL!
Thank you, Tom. Not only does this touch on the fears that I have, but I relate to it because many of my relatives have fought cancer. Some have lost that fight. My girlfriend also had leukemia when she was about eight years old. We KNOW there has to be a cure. After this long they're only holding onto it because cancer and people's suffering that comes with it is a multi billion dollar business. I have supported you for about two years now, and I've loved all of your content. Please continue to open people's eyes and make the world a better place with your music. On behalf of all of your fans and all the people cancer has affected the lives of, thank you.
Most cancers are cured. Its just that the cure is extremely expensive and doesn't work for everyone. If a cancer has a 99.5% mortality rate, its technically been cured because the treatment has saved a person from it. Treatment is expensive because that's just simply what it costs. Yeah, it sucks, but that's life. No need to complain about it. Just be glad you don't have a disease that has 100% mortality rate that slowly takes away your mental and physical capacities and takes a decade to kill you like Alzheimers or Parkinsons.
Amazing
Fighter
I work in a medical dispensary in Colorado Springs. One of my favorite patients was just given  2-4 weeks to live  because her doctor missed the cancer.  My grandmother was just given 3-6 months to live with lung cancer. This song made my ass cry like a baby, but I'm hoping these phoenix tears will help cure them. Thank you Tom for this song, seriously thank you brother.
nice calm cam work nova👍👍
100% real as always
My grandma has stage 4 cancer. Thanks for making this man🙏
Best Wishes from Germany, great song that i like
Love it Tom & Nova!
my mother survived breast cancer 2016❤️
I lost my mother to cancer August 30, 2013. It’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to me and my family. Fuck cancer man. Thank you for this beautiful song Tom❤️
Wow having lost to many family members to this horrible illness I am crying . Thank you Tom as always your voice will be heard
You said before this song came out you will cry! and that was it I didn't know what the song/rap was going to be after losing 2 grandads 2 nannies and my favourite uncle you did it you made me cry thank you Tom McDonald and there is a haven❤
Tom your a magnificent individual.  Wonderful lyrics.  Had me tear up watching the video FUCK cancer lost an uncle to it and a cousin
This song hits hard...to those battling, keep fighting! Don’t give up!!! 🙏🏼
I was in my 20s my sister died age 21 1988 I've never got over losing her each day is a struggle to hold back the tears there was only us two our families had died before that
My step dad died of stomach cancer almost 2 years ago. It was the worst thing I have ever seen. He died 16 days after they found it. He is sadly missed. It's a horrible way to die. 😪
This WHOLE song has so much truth in it 💯 and straight🔥🔥💯 MUCH LOVE AND RESPECT FAM
Just wow bro. Thank you.
My mother passed form Cancer this year it is so unfair to her she fought so strong!!! Love this song thanks so much Tom!!! Love you Momma Fly High!!!!!!
No words jus Wow this is amazing 🤯❤️
You're beautiful!
Gotta keep us sick. $$$
Incredible Tom..This one hits home. Let's just say if someone doesn't appreciate the message, they're already dead inside. Cancer has a cure. I see the hospital bills and treatment costs. There is no way they will give up the cure. In the next decade, they are set to make a trillion dollars on cancer treatments. The entire west coast of the U.S. and Canada is heavily radiated from Fukushima. The government however turned off the Geiger counters along the west coast several years ago. By looking up individuals who do their own testing, they are seeing ten to twenty times the acceptable background radiation. Even higher during rainfall. It's ashame those in power look at us as temporary wage earners for their benefit, but could care less once you're retired, or have been disabled by the very poisons they sold and got you addicted too. You want to know something truly terrifying, THEY DON'T CARE. Now pay your taxes, feel oppressed, wear a muzzle, be scared, take your medicine, vote for who we say, and shut up. If not the democrats have promised to burn it all down. That is the state of America today.
Damn bro this one hit deep. Im a childhood cancer survivor and i felt the pain of that family. My dad had to go through it all alone as a single parent while i was sick. Good song and great video man
Way to pull at the heart strings tom!! 😟😢
Sad
Thanks for the tears bruv you always know how to hit a man right in the feelings!
My uncles dying of stage 4 lung cancer as we speak. Thanks for dropping this tom
Thank You! I miss our daughter Karlie so much she is a twin we lost her at 15 they are 18 now. A huge chunk of my heart is gone and I feel so broken. I feel like I should have done more!

Amazing!!!
i lost my mom and grandma 2 cancer
Love it bro!! I'm a survivor of cancer and I couldn't agree more with this song!!
Tom I just lost my daddy in April , he chose to let it run its course because of everything you talk about. He didn't want to leave everyone in debt for no promises extra time and at what level of life would he have that extra time in? I loved this song hunny. It made me bawl
Thanks for your Music.  It always hits the heart. I'm a survivor my sister is a survivor. My mother is a survivor.
Tom breaks the mold.  We need more people like him.  Fuck the mold.
I lost my dad to cancer and my mom lost her one breast from cancer and it's changed us and now I have multiple sclerosis and it's scary as hell.
Who are the people that dislike this??    Wtf is wrong with some people??
Such a beautiful song brother. Between you and upchurch y'all have helped a lot of people. Keep doing you brother.
It left me in tears. I can't stop. Thank you Tom and Nova 💔❤❤💔
Never give up!’!! Lit the fuck up
Thank you tom !!! You never seem to fail us
Love it had so many family and friends have it
Cancer is population control. They don’t want to release the cure.
Dude u are an amazing artist..we need more like u in higher positions around the world n jus maybe save ourselves from self destruction..everyone together moving as one is the cure all we need now..
Im in tears this song is so moving, so beautiful yet so true.  God bless you Tom.  My mom died of cancer, so did my grandfather.  Sad when the system is so corrupt that they could care less about the people.
I lost my grandfather 2 days ago from cancer and thus helped alot this couldn't come out at a more perfect time thx brutha love u and ur art god bless❤❤
This will definitely help alot of people bro
My brother this hits home so bad and have been saying this for years! My babygirl Aaliyah has Stage 4 Neuroblastoma ( rare form of childhood cancer)! My daughter was diagnosed when she was 3 and is almost 8 she was cancer free for a year and a half now well in March the cancer has come back and it’s not very good for her ( us) but we will not give up and we pray 100 times a day for a miracle. This song has me balling my eyes out , man there’s nothing worse than watching your child go through this and there is nothing we can do. We are devastated as a family but trying to hold it together for her and make her life as pain free and “ normal” as possible. You are an amazing artist with a huge heart thank you for writing this song! Her name is Aaliyah Carballo she’s 7 ( 8 ) next month she has a page on Facebook called Aaliyah Strong if you would like to check it out. But your music and a few other independent artist have been getting us through all these hospital stays and I want to thank you for that. I doubt you will read this book ( LOL ) but if you thank you brother this means so much that I can’t describe and to make things a lot harder my Beautiful Mother is dying of breast cancer as well so this song really, really hits home. Thank you #Aaliyahstrong ❤️🎗❤️🎗❤️🎗❤️🎗❤️🎗.    #Cancersucks    #theycancureitbutdontwantto
Great song Tom
I might not know a person that have it but I can relate
I shared this. Thank you for using your platform and your voice to say what needs to be said. #fuckcancer #rhec
Thanks man .
Tom your heart, passion, honesty and pure talent is an absolute testament to the fact that I think you are a living legend! Keep it up brother you truly touch a lot of peoples lives, and I can’t thank you enough for sharing your gift with this world
Your the best bro never give up your better than any rapper I listen to
This is one of the best and truest things I've ever heard from you
Touching
You are one of the most amazing people in this world Tom McDonald.
Lost my mom to cancer three months ago. I used to hate life since I was a kid always living with darkness in my mind. But seeing my mother fight till the end wanting to live, made me realize how fortunate I am to be alive and well.
OMG. I have NO WORDS for this.... Beautiful! I'm not crying, you're crying....
Thank you for this fight anthem! My husband of 35 years is fighting now just to stay as long as he can. This really hits home for us. THANKS again....
proud of you bro!
This is so fucking beautiful bro I love this thank you💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn bro so much truth in your work , don't stop the world needs your voice
Fire bro 🔥
Just lost my grandfather to cancer a month ago .... it's sad  Also lost both my parents to drug addiction you should rap about that Tom
Tom heaven is where we go when we die i can prove it and i can show how to as well
Hey man thanks. I love your music. I just lost my 51 year old mother she had breast cancer and beat it danced with me on my wedding then got brain cancer. She passed away the day my son was born. August 6th 2020. I had a good cry watching this. Keep up the good work my man.
THEY CREATED IT TO CULL WE THE PEOPLE BUT SHHHHHH
My brother died 2 years ago, throat cancer.
I love you man. Keep it up
i usually don't cry but this brought me to tears thank you Tom MacDonald
i felt that. i dont even know anyone who has it but i almost cried. its amazing how much emotion u give and spread it. i saved all ur music!
Appreciate tom🔥🔥🔥
Awesome song! The meaning behind the song is strong...
Please Don't allow the demons 😈 of this world to break you. Keep allowing God to minister to you and yours. Allow Him to continue to lead and direct your path.
I love how I just got information I got it and this came out the next day hahaha 😂 love the timing 😁
I lost both of my grandparents to this monster's "cure". Chemo and radiation are just legalized poison, there HAS to be an alternative, and i think they have had it for years
Cringe
my grandmother had brain cancer, I have multiple sclerosis and my father was one of the doctors that died from COVID-19 in March, and this video made me think of both of them and cry and smile with their memories. thank you Tom for that
Tom dude thank you for this man I lost my auntie in July to cancer I still cant believe she is gone
My brother would love this song
WE LOVE YOU TOM MACDONALD #HangoverGxngForLife
We got to fight it together
Man this hits real deep. I was diagnosed at 15 with stage 4 non Hodgkin’s lymphoma. My treatment wasn’t easy but compared to some of the friends I made in the hospital, it was a cake walk. This song will definitely help a lot of people get through the dark times of treatment. Thank you for writing such an uplifting song for the fighters out there. If any fighters are reading this, keep your head up and stay strong! I know it’s hard, especially the days that the pain is so unbearable you’re praying for death. You still have a long life to live. Whatever you do don’t give up! I love you all! #fuckcancer
Covid 19 is far down the list of dangers.. Can we worry about €ancer & car crash victims first!?!  RESPONSIBILITIES, COMMON SENSE & DIGNITY a few things society has gotten rid of! Focused on,    Squirrel!!  🙃 Safety 3rd!
THIS! THIS IS WHY I LOVE YOUR MUSIC! THANK YOU!😔🤘🤟🥰
Caught this 🔥🔥🔥 song on pandora at 4am on my way to work man. Definitely hits home for me in so many ways for so many family members.
Sorry to recomment but this hots hard thank you Tom.  Best song of 2020 for me
From the uk 👍👍👍👍👍
Who are the heartless pos’s who disliked this? Seriously, if you dislike Tom so much that you would dislike a video against cancer, maybe you should unsubscribe and stop watching.  Tom, awesome job to bring awareness and real talk about why we haven’t solved these diseases.
I am a cancer survivor 💜! Thank you Tom ❤
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Death is just another waking up process.  ✌️❤️🍄
Tom this one's so amazing.  It touches so many peoples lives. Thank you so much...I shared as I cried...so many lost senselessly. I'm sure they have a cure for cancer but they can't let it out...billions will be lost by those big pharmaceutical companies and they won't let that happen. Sickening.
BEST WORK .
This is good man, and a real truth bomb.
Keep going tom
I have a cousin that wasn't supposed to live past 6 from cancer. Went through radiation. Survived, has had tumors, seizers and hundreds of surgeries. And he graduated high school last year and is now having brain surgery and he's one strong kid. Love the song Tom.
This is perfect song for those fighting cancer and prayers for all that’s fighting cancer
This is the most meaningful song you’ve made yet! My grandmother has just been diagnosed with breast cancer and my mom had colon cancer (now cancer free). People don’t know how hard it is until you or a family member gets it. Thank you for this song.
Straight f...ing fire love it
Thank you man I know how it feels to be with cancer it's not a fun thing I've dealt with it with my grandfather I was with him every step thank you
Fuck you tom! I was trying not to cry today haha! Loved this song, thanks for supporting those and calling out big pharma
Awsome
I lowkey hope he does a similar song for abortion. How people are so careless about life.
This is deep brah!!
i had cancer this year and had my transplant and man i hope this was the only time, this illness is the worst and i wouldnt wish anyone such a terrible time. EDIT: and of course what a beautiful song, this helps alot since im still in hospital. Man Tom i wish i could hug you. This made me cry :)
Wow Tom! Thank you so much for this song! You are Beyond inspirational and I felt this song in my soul. I don't have cancer but I have lost people to it and I have a ton of chronic health issues like type 1 diabetes fibromyalgia anxiety depression BPD gastroparesis and GERD. Some days it's hard just to make it through the minutes or to even try to reach the hour mark so thank you for this anthem to help not only people who are affected by cancer but to have the chorus be an Anthem for anyone struggling with any health issue anywhere. Thank you Tom and bless you Nova for this song
Deep
I can't wait til you stop making these clickbait titles. Maybe then I'll be able to listen to your songs more than once.
If you’re reading this and is going through a tough time right now, there’s a light at the end of that tunnel.
I absolutely loved every f*ck!ng word of this song. Im so grateful to my brother in law for sharing it with me.   I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer last October... my journey has been quite difficult and at times just unimaginable.   This song ♡. New fan.
i have heart lung and intestine cancer i appreciate this song alot
FUCKING REAL AND TRUE .... WAKE UP GOVERNMENT OF THE WORLD . KEEP GOING TOM YOU ARE TRUE . TRY AND DO A COLLABORATION WITH CHAMILLIONAIRE.  GO TO A SO CALLED IM TRUE . THAT WOULD BE WICKED . KEEP GOING 💬💬💬💬💬💨💨💨💨💨💨💥👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Great song. There is no conspiracy. Cancer is much more complex than people think.
This song is sicc like the title🤮💪🔥
This rapper is so amazing 💥💥he always speak the truth,💥💥 this is the people we can support love you man💝💝💞
Wow, this song and mv are so well put together. Salutes to Tom, Nova, Logan Fulton and the actors.   My mother's a cancer survivor who went through radiation & chemo. I've seen what the pain looks like and I've seen what the bill would look like if not for full health coverage (cause even the difference between full and partial is ridiculous). Nothing about it is inexpensive.   Even still, in the end it is all worth it. Stay fighting. Prayers up to all 💯💯🙏🏾🙏🏾
My aunt is going on hospice today due to brain cancer.... Mom been on chemo for 10 years... surgery in November....
My grandma got lymphoma in march died in april. First close relative ive lost. I got her to go to the hospital 4 days before she died. This song brought a few tears to my eye bro great song.
Thank you for this song its home really bad have had a 5 year battle with non Hodgkin's lymphoma I'm very thankful I'm still here keep up the amazing work H.O.G. 4 life
Kinda let down with all the hype there was for this😐I mean yea it’s a amazing video but not what I was expecting.
my brother was just diagnosed with throat cancer 3 weeks ago .
Wow! This song is gonna changes lives in so many ways. You never stop amazing me. Thank you so much for being a huge voice.
Hats off Tom you are an angel brother you and your army are bringing so much light in a dark world my heart beats in time with yours. Forever grateful and thankful for your art 🙏♥️🇮🇪💪
Speaking the hard truth like always. This one had me in tears. Keep spreading the truth like wild fire! You are amazing!
this is real though you talking about a subject that reaches so many family's I fuck with tom fr.
Tom gets it.. "We get cancer from keeping all our demons a secret". Thats where all illness comes from.
Standing ovation sir . And to add I've always said they can beat cancer but the company who has the cure is holding everyone to ransom . Governments need to step.in and atop the big pharmaceutical giants from grossly profiting off sick people
This song brought my wife to tears she just lost her mom to cancer and this song made her smile and think of her mom i love it man keep up the amazing work your doing
This song really hits home . You are the best artist Number one brother Love you man keep it up
Right in the feels.
Oh my gosh. Like right on the first sentence i cried. Tom, i cried!! I don't normally cry easily. But You are amazing You speak the truth! You speak word! Love you Tom and Nova! You both are amazing!
No words...😪😪 just one of the best EVER!!!! #CANCERSUCKS
The treatment is more profitable than the cure.
Thank you for this man because it’s just what I needed to hear right now...❤️😢
Incredible song Tom, youre the realest of rappers!
Beautifully written and spoken! I lost my sister at the age of 3 to Leukemia, this song hits me in the feels!
Beautiful my guy.  Nice track
🎩 off to yo Tom. Real words spoken here much love, peace, harmony and happy health to everybody ✌️✌️ spread love.
Good stuff bud

Absolutely amazing song
Tom....you are a wonderful human.
This brought tears to my eyes because I’ve lost 3 grandparents and a mother in law to cancer. Keep doing your thing and keep making inspirational music. You’re awesome, keep it up.
Tom, you’re absolutely amazing! You rap on some real stuff. You and Nova are the best out! Wish I could get everyone to listen to you! Real is rare!
500 bucks in an hr nicely done
Great video. You guys are awesome.
Awesome... It's true they got the cure back in the 60s...
This is to my teacher, my school mother, no my mother that I lost due to cancer earlier this year 😖💔, thank you Tom. HOG forever!
Wasn't lying when you said we'd cry. I don't know about yall but I teared up a lil bit
If you read this, look up a documentary called "food matters"  they have literally used vitamin C in extremely high doses (500,000mg)  injected intravenously to shrink cancer to almost nothing then remove. Patients on death row to cancer came back and are now cancer free, however, its illegal to cure using these methods in the USA because it's not profitable for the medical industry.
This do be deep tho
Tom you’re gonna be the top, and I truly believe that. I’ve been following you on YouTube and Instagram since you had 40k on YouTube and you’ve done so many great things for this community and the rest of the world that hears your music. This truly hit different and will be an anthem for so many people fighting. Who knows your music could be the cure for them and the armor that they put on before treatments!!! Love you Tom
Bro this shit is fire. Definitely hits hard
Dude I love your music
As a 2 time cancer survivor at 33 it's really nice to see someone who cares enough to make art for something positive instead of rapping about fake lifestyles. Through my own research it seems the best way to fight cancer is prevention through education and self care.
This is amazing bro! Thank you !
Wow!!!!!! My mother died from breast cancer when i was 16...right when i needed her most!! I watched her fight everyday for a year...even gave up my senior year in school to stay home and give her pain shots round the clock so that my father could finish out his 30 yrs of work and retire...it ate her away and at 80 lbs. it took her life!! My life has never been the same. Thank You for this song...you never ever fail to inspire!!!! Love You Tom and Nova and i have never even met you.
Such a beautiful and emotional song Tom. I can hear the pain and testimony in your voice. I love it.
One of the best songs from the album. Cannot wait to see a video for satanic rappers, or disgusting.
What made you want to write a song about this? Was there a specific interaction that inspired you or was it something that’s been on your mind for awhile?  I ask because cancer nearly took my mother a couple years ago and I have a friend who lost her mom not long before that. We now know that on my mom’s side of the family, cancer is a fairly common occurrence.
Just look up Dr Burzynski in Texas.    that will show you what the government thinks about us having a cure.
Much love and respect from Mumbai India 🇮🇳
I have no words 🥺 This is something that people really don’t know who bad it is until they have a family member sick. And yes there videos and trining that shows you what cancer can do but one thing is watching those effects happend on a stranger , and another is watching the same problem but this time on your father or brother or sister you never know 🥺 I hope and pray that the people with cancer can finally have a cure I really don’t care if I have to donated my brain to find a cure because they suffer for something they never asked for 🥺 and worst is that a lot of doctors just want the money not the cure if they’re is one 🥺🥺❤️
This hits home because my uncle died of cancer and they turned his house into a doctors office and he had it 2 times and he survived it the first time but the second time he died from it
As someone who's mother has had cancer twice, this song really hit home. When I was 5 she had stage 4 colon cancer and when I was 13 or 14 she had lung cancer. She's still here but it left lasting affects that will stick with me until the day I die. Cancer is terrible in what it does to your loved ones and the ones who surround the one who is sick.
My mother died from cancer in 2010. Technically it was the chemo that caused her strokes that killed her. I was only 11. This song came out of left field but it hits hard with me
This song is something I've needed for a long time multiple cancers run in my family and I have cystic breast and bennie lumps in them and it's the scariest thing to me thank you for letting me know its gonna be okay
All I can say is just WOW!
justin bieber and Tom are making us cry these days 💔🙏
It hurts more people than just the cancer patient. My step dad passed my mom got cancer and now i wi stand to be alone. Why cant we get a fix. Im gonna be an orphan while i go to in house. Im 39 but i will be alone
Well, I was not expecting to get emotional. I lost my grandma on July 5th from stage 4 metastatic lung cancer. She is my best friend, and we were planning to have her be our flower girl for our wedding.   I'm also in the medical field, and I don't understand how there isn't a cure. Then again how can we grow synthetic skin in a lab, transplant organs, have robotic surgeries, but not cure a disease?
I loved this song when I heard it on your album 'Gravestones'.  Your lyrics & Nova's videos are inspirational & touching!  Amazing work once again Tom & Nova.  Keep 'em coming!
The amount of money used in research for a cure and its results have to do with the complexity of the many different types of cancers.  The pharmaceuticals that make it to market have to cover the expenses of each of the compounds that fail. For everyone that makes it through phase 1, 2, 3A, 3b, and do not get pulled during four, are several hundred. Once the drug has made it through the process the limited life of the patent is another major factor as to why the cost is so high. And finally, with everything we have developed we are approaching the flat of the curve, It is the law of diminishing returns. I am a fan, much like your Covid track, you can trust the science, there is no pharmaceutical company conspiracy. My mother has been in 30 remission of breast cancer. She had chemo, radiation, and a double mastectomy. I have experience in working for a contract research organization, a Masters of science in healthcare and would be happy to answer any questions with humility. This shit is painful I know.
My uncle has stage 4... this song makes me sad...its not bad....just hit close to home
3 years cancer free
God this realy brought me to tears . My mom has cancer and that was the hardest thing in the world to here. Thank you tom for this . You are a truly amazing artist.
Wish my fam got to listn to this hope there is something that wat keeps me going
By far one of his best messages
😞😞😞😞😞😞
Ur underrated
This song feel like it came at a random time but i love it. This is my favorite kind of Tom Macdonald.
Wow, as a cancer survivor this hits hard. Tears are falling. Thanks for everything you're doing brother it's very much appreciated!!
My pops died last Jan from stage 4 lung cancer, he was a SEAL during nam and my hero. This fucked up disease hits everybody sometime, all we can do is fight back and support each other. Thanks for this bud, it meant the world to me.
🔥🔥🔥😥😥😭😭 Thank you for this! It’s my new anthem while having a family member battling this ugly coward called cancer! 💜💜💜
Tom hit us with another truth bomb
I run a non profit for cancer research and educate massive amount of families about how our immune system actually can fight every disease but all the food we eat keeps our cells from communicating to fight and be normal.  You hit it right on the head  This is a beautiful song brother  We as in all of us have your back and we are so proud of the movement you are creating with all of your music.  You are SUPPORTED BY US
Let come together to hit half a billion views before next week Friday.... Omg😢😢😢 we pay for them to kill us
Im a mintute in and i already live it. Keep doing good brother. I love you❤❤
Thank u Tom ♥️
You were right!  I cried!
Best one yet!
Cringe
This one was hard to listen too. I have lost both parents, and 2 grandparents to cancer. Sometimes it feels like the ones of us left behind are the ones that suffer. Great song for those strong enough to fight.
I listen to the song as soon as it came out it was like 2 seconds when uploaded and i like this song its amazing
My wife pass away at 29 pancreatic cancer 3/11/18 #fuckcancer
Such a great song 🔥🔥🔥
My mom passed away from cancer in 2015, this hit home hard as fuck Tom, I appreciate you and how inspiring you are, my music will hopefully be as meaningful as this
Watching and being with my when he had cancer... I swear they have a cure but I guess if u dont have the money for it then screw it. GOD BLESS EVERYONE THAT HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT FIGHT! U ARE NOT ALONE! WE LOVE U! MUCH LOVE FROM WV!
Absolutely love this man! Hits right it the feels
This definitely hit home my mother has terminal bone cancer
This is the song right here my brother the most beautiful song that would touch anyone’s heart. Good work Tom very darn good work. I’ve always wanted to become a music artist my self but have no help. Keep strong and keep up the good work.
Amazingly powerful words!!
Thank you Tom 😭❤️
Tom MacDonald, I love you bro, but this hit me so hard.... my grandpa has Cancer and he’s fighting it but he’s struggling pretty hard. This song hits different but thanks for giving the message to stay strong and keep hope. 😭❤️
Hmm... get em!
Another great song and video. Amazing as always. I always look forward to ur Friday video releases.
Cancer develops even after death.
Wow, that hit me different. Great Job!
Amazing! I love it. You´re an absolutely amazing artist.
So true!!! Made me cry. I love it man. Great job my friend!! Much love from West Virginia
A cure would be worth Trillions of dollars. No profit motivated company would sit on it. Having a cure doesn't stop people from developing cancer. If anything a cure would make us all more likely to keep engaging in cancer-causing behaviors like cigarettes and crappy diets. There are hundreds of different cancers, all of which are your own cells growing out of control. It's not a question of spending money on research. It's how to we only kill the bad cells in a human, without killing the rest of you too.
Damn Tom Macdonald dropping hit after hit
Damn Tom, you and Nova are sooooooooooo fu@#ing talented.  P.S. Dr. Royal Rife cured cancer in the thirties. They discredited his work because there is no profit in healthy people.  Look him up on Wikipedia, they continue to discredit his discoveries, no big surprise.
It is insane. The amount of money and all this time, all this tech and they still haven't solved it. They need to work on cell replication. So they can actually replace the cells faster than they are destroyed and we need to stop killing each other with the most ridiculous form of "treatment" kill it with radiation only to die from radiation poisoning from excessive use. I would not be surprised if they did actually know how to cure it but didn't tell anyone. I mean, he really is right. You think about how much money is involved and how selfish humanity can be and it all suddenly makes sense.
Damn brother, I wasn't ready for that one right now ..my sister is battling cancer so hard right now ...I do appreciate it don't get me wrong it just touches my heart in a hard way right now  ...your unbelievable my man .. love you bro ..thanks
Beautiful..!!
incredible!
Hey Tom you hit a super soft spot in my heart My grandma died of lung cancer so this song it's phenomenal. You are the best rapper of all time they call Eminem the rap God well he's not a rap god compared to you you are the Rap God you are the rap angel it's not even about rabbits it's about you being the best lyricist keep on doing what you doing bud. Hangovergang 4life

My son loves you. He is a Cancer patient for 8 years. He's still with us.
Brother was diagnosed 2 weeks ago with stage 4. He is 30 years old so this hits home big time. Thanks
Lost my dad to cancer 1 month after I came home from my deployment in Afghan. I also lost friends in Afghanistan so yeah. Thank you tom. Means more than u could realize.
My mother has intestinal cancer that thanks to those drugs has lived with it from her 50 into her 60’s, almost into her 70’s. My father who had lung cancer got a new type of treatment they called it localized radiation where they target irradiated the cancer not his whole body. Technology can only advance so fast but it is getting better.
Respect Bro
If you dislike a song like this I hope you catch the Corona virus
I just love your music and messages.
One of the many forms of population control.
The thought of this made me cry because cancer runs in my family and I'm worried about my Mother getting it. Thank you to everyone who survived cancer. Really thank you
75k in 1 hour! Get it Tom!
Wow, you weren't kidding about crying! I lost my dad in 2006 from cancer, and every time he'd go in there was another place that he had it sprout up, there was no fighting it for him. So my mom and I had to be strong for him and "hide" what the doctor's said because he would have given up and instead of the 5 months that we got w/ him it would have been A LOT less. This hit home so strong that I'm still in tears! Love your work, both yours and Nova's!
😥 Thank you for another beautiful song ❤❤❤
U touched my heart and my inner soul through your lyrics.....So much truth ....❤️❤️❤️❤️
RIP Tom Searle († 2016) from the all-time-awesome #ArchitectsUK who was been taken away by cancer. "If hope is a prison, then maybe faith will set me free"
I fought it for 5 years and lost my left kidney then my health went to shit thanks for the video
This hits close to home. Great song bro.
Both of my grandma's lost their fight with cancer. I cried when I listened to this song this morning and I just ugly cried watching the video. Your team (you and Nova) are amazing. I love your music, videos always add another level, your spoken word gets me emotional every time and your ghost story had me sucked in. Thank you
I have  lost family to cancer Rest in peace  world wide to people passed to cancer 😇😇😇😇🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Another great song.  I've lost a few family members to cancer and now I have a friend going through a battle with it.
This song made me cry. Even if some good human being finds the cure, they'll be paid to keep quiet. Even if they don't agree, they'll be smothered and the cure made illegal except for the rich, influential people who may of found out about it.
This is an amazing song !  My mom died from cancer when I was 16 and this is super true and I can relate to this show so much thank you and keep the songs comming :)
As a cancer survivor and a fan you hit this so well. My kid cousin passed from this it's painful for the person and every one around. Keeping fighting tom much love
and again the truth is coming out of you're mouth Tom. when i listen this song i cry. beautiful song bro✌👍
Bro i have all your albums and have listened to every song countless times but I awear nothing sends a great song straight to the feels like a great video!!! You and Nova are awesome together keep up the great work !!!!H.O.G !!!!!
The sad part is I have not met anyone who’s life has not been affected by cancer and if ur one of the few who haven’t ur lucky
Tom, you are THE FUCKING MAN! An absolute real one for this, brother.  Thank you!
This song hit me hard emotionally, thank you @Tom Macdonald for making real music.
I'm fighting stage 4 colon cancer and this song helps to remember to keep fighting till the end, whenever that is.
I just lose my grandma to cancer 2 weeks ago..
Can I get an Amen for this song?
savage man crazy how pretty much all your songs hit home!
One of the most heart felt songs you have made so far keep up the awesome work you and Nova give the people what they need to keep fighting.  I have family and friends fighting different types of cancer at the moment and this really would help them push through and win that fight
Holy fuck this hits HARD!
Thank you Tom!  4 year breast cancer survivor here.
Man tom.  Killin it..  amazingly beautiful bro
💯😥
don't know how anyone can listen to any of this mans music and say its click bait. He puts  his heart and soul into every song he puts out and it all for us. The true HOG. That need to hear that we matter. That our addictions, and our mental health problems are not always going to define who we are.  I LOVE YOU TOM AND NOVA YOU TWO MEAN THE WORLD TO ME.  Even though I can't buy your  cd's or our merchandise like I would love to so I could help you even a fraction of how much you help me. H.O.G for ever
I needed this two years ago as dad lost his fight last year
the worst and most cringiest rapper in the game, Tom MacDonald, ladies and gent
Man. Without toms music I'd still be suicidal in a dark room holding a gun to my head screaming at a wall just HOPING someone would come along and make me hesitate.   Tom, it was you that got me to hesitate, and ever since your music has helped me focus on things that matter.   Now, I'm not a dick rider. 🙄😒  But. Thanks man.
You are on topics that need to be SPOKE on real shit
40%?? Numbers are not even close to that in Europe they are putting something in your food or some shit.
Lost my mum to cancer in 2018 after she fought for 2 years. This song reminds me of how hard she fought.....strongest woman I've ever known....
Awesome job
I recently lost my sister to cancer, this song hits a lot of the marks
Beautiful song man as always
Keep producing bro. Such talent you have.
Thank you for this song Tom, my uncle and my great grandmother passed from cancer, I will definitely be keeping this song close to my heart forever, thank you from the bottom of my heart, you are an amazing human
My father is a stomach cancer survivor, and its his Bday today , Happy bday Pops 🤙🏼❤️🔉🔉🔉, never relent keep fighting !
Jesus is the only way. I tell you that because we all need him. While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
Lost my favorite cousin  to cancer. I still run back the last Christmas we spent together as a family in the basement of my aunt's house. Best Christmas ever </3 He was always the light of the party. RIP Joshua </3
A father figure died from pancreatic cancer last year. Thanks Tom, this song is really powerful, peace love and blessings to anyone affected by this. Be strong.
Lost my dad , brother, grandmother to this god damn disease!😡😡😡
You were right, it did made my cry. What's even crazier, today is the funeral service for my amazing friend that fought for his life from pancreatic cancer. Took him after only 8 months of knowing he even had it. Fucking sad bro. But there are soooo many out there that are still fighting and needed to hear this song. Just love you man. 💙
dam tom.... that one hits me hard.... RIP Boomer/my brother.
I lost my mother in law to cancer at age 46. Six months later, cancer got my mom. Then a year later, lost my wife’s step dad. A month after, my father in law was diagnosed. I guess things like cancer is just a reminder that we are not ultimately in control. Please, cherish every single minute you have with loved ones. You never know when god will come calling.
As the wife of a husband who constantly battling heath issue... it’s very dearing to hear a song that’s inspiring. Thank you.  He is going through a medical diagnosis as you uploaded this video, hoping the good news and thanks for the encouraging lyrics.
You pack a lot of meaning into 1 song and I have been loving your music but this once hits hard mad respect man.
My sister fought for three years even trying experimental drugs and treatments she had cervical cancer that in the end spread through her body to her brain with a tumor even with all those treatments. She past at the age of 44 she was a CNA and worked her whole life taking care of the elderly in nursing homes and even donated her body to science to further studies into cancer research even in death she still wanted to help people and make a difference. Prayers for all fighting this fight. And prayers for those who help them fight I went through the fight with my sister as her care taker and know your fight to. 🙏
This song hit home bro 😭😭 wish they would have never took out Dr sebi
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏
Real tears man. So much love and respect. Thank you for this song.
Fuck that song hit me. Just got home from doctor trying to figure out what's wrong with my bod.
Curing someone and doing it one treatment is not profitable. Everything is about money! religion, government, medicine doesn't matter its about money
Wish i could like this 1 million times over. Damn good song and powerful video man
Shows you what happens when someone with no medical education thinks they know about disease. There is a lot of truth in this though. If you or someone you know has cancer, all my best to you in your battle. Know I am trying to help in whatever way I can. Signed~A medical geneticist working on cancer research. Love and respect.
I had a family I was close to die of 2 different types of cancer. I’m thinking of him right now. Thank you Tom!!
My dad lost his battle literally 3 months after his diagnosis.  Still miss him everyday. Died in the most ironic day ever 4/1/19.
Tell the government about all there shit tom.  HELL. Yea I love you. So tell ya girl the is for being there for you she keeps you strong. For us we love her to
My Brother past away in 2018 to lucimea  cancer he was the only one who helped Daughter when she got in fights.
This is powerful, thank you. RIP Tristian. He was only 3.
if i ever get diagnosed with cancer imma do like my grandmaw. screw chemo, imma live my life to the fullest til its my time=
If there was a "LOVE" button I'd hit that button for you man lol. F*cking AMAZING!!! Thx Tom. Honestly, your music gets better and better every time their released 🙏
First I didn't wanna click it bc mz mind comes back. Dad made it and mom is still fighting both parents at the same time and then "friends" who canceled their friendship bc I didn't got time for their bs. At the end they were toxic just don't wanna see that.  Now Only family, my girl her daughter and me.  Thank you Tom for everything
Hell Yeah! Love from Germany to you Tom and every HOG Member around the world. ❤️❤️❤️
Respect for this bro
This one hits deep. Thank you Tom 💙
Bro I love how real you are and how you talk about the type real problems of the world. I've lost so many friends and family to this thank you for showing heart and real. Never stop being you!
Thank you.....
Beautiful 🙌🙌
Omg this was so sad
Just truly an amazing person never stop being you man! Thank you
Good song Tom!
Yo Tom your the man bro. We all love you so much man. This song hit home so hard brought tears to my eyes. God bless you brother. Hangover gang for life!
Thank you
Amazing. Strong facts!!
God damn this is so good
Thanks Tom. You are truly amazing. We miss our Grammy one year and one day ago. R. I. P. Grammy. Watching from Florida.
Ok imma just say I can't stand the myth of "cancer has a cure they just wont give it"  Cancer is a category of disease not just one thing. Every type of cancer is completely different and the idea that people who have dedicated their lives to curing various forms of it are suddenly bought off to withhold the cure is a conspiracy theory up there with the antivax loons.   Seriously, please stop perpetuating this idea that cancer has a cure. That is like saying all broken bones just require an arm cast - there are 206 bones in our body and the idea that we can fix them all with an arm cast is lunacy.  There are well over 100 types of cancer and although they are all in the same category of ailments the idea that we have a cure for all of them is insane. We do have a cure for some - that is why some forms of cancer have a massively low prognosis and others have an overwhelmingly high prognosis.  So yeah, love most of your music tom but you fell for the ideocracy of blanket statements in this one.
My family and I found out on July 3, 2019 that my father had lung cancer. We lost him 1 month later on August 5. We will be burying his ashes tomorrow October 17, 2020. Thank you for this beautiful song Tom. Much love to you and yours!!!!
Your songs give me chills man. I had tears in my eyes while listening to this song. I freaking love that you rap about real shit and not girls and drugs like all the other rappers. Thats where you separate yourself from the others and I absolutely love that! Hands down my favorite rapper ever!!!! So glad I found you Tom. Your music has literally changed my life. Thank you.
I lost my grandmother to cancer last year It destroyed my mom and it hurt to see my grandma slowly dying. Thank you for this song.
Tom you are awesome bro
Cannabis oil it’s worked for millions of people
This is gonna blow up huge man, we needed to hear this
Dammit...crying like a baby,too many,too soon,still hurts no matter how long it's been
That was a great song Tom!!! I lost my aunt and my grandfather to cancer last year...i was very close to my grandfather and since his passing I spend about 45 mins to an hour every week visiting him
Deep! Almost every track I have heard from u has a deeper meaning, the world needs this!
Dam Tom this was Deep i lost a few family members to this BS. And your right no one is talking about it as much as they should. Love this video Thank you to you and the HOG gang!!!!
Thx lost both my parents, friends, from cancer. 🥰🙏
is this guy serious??  10 seconds in im depressed and outta here.  this dude aint my cup of tea.  i respect his hustle but hell no!!!!
Mad Love from Sierra Leone 🇸🇱🇸🇱🇸🇱💖💖💯Tom True Messenger From God... God bless you bro
My oldest sister won her battle 30 years ago she got Leukemia at 10. She lost a leg due to Gangrene because of it. They almost killed her 3 times and got her hooked on Morphine. She had to detox at such a young age. Then they said she would be barren because of the radiation, but she survived been in remission sense, learned to walk with a fake leg (she was so happy to have an ankle again a few years ago), and surprised everyone twice by gifting us my niece and nephew. So battle hard and don't believe everything the doctors tell ya. There's a reason why they call it a practice and not a cure center it really is just their best guess. Much love to all with hard choices.
You don't know what you can take Untill you realize you didn't break! Wow! Speachless. That line left me speechless
Good job bro. People need this. Thank you!
Man reading through some of these comments while listening to the song is brutal. I've never actually lost someone close to cancer, but I can certainly understand the pain and frustration. Prayers to all of u in the comments affected by this curse of a disease
Eat and live clean - that's the best you can do. Consume a cancer fighting diet like a whole foods plant based diet and help you body and planet at the same time.
Made me cry man. Fuck cancer. We have the technology and the cure. Release it.
Even if you do t like this song how can you give it a thumbs down he’s speaking truth y’all doubters need to listen pay attention the truth is in front of your eyes 👀
Legend
Amazing song, and it hits very close to home!! Keep making heart felt music..
I lost my grandma to cancer 2 years ago and my grandpa had pancreatic cancer about 8 years ago also so this really hit home lucky I still have my grandfather
Holy shit bro this is absolutely amazing!!!! Your such an awesome and beautiful soul. Thank you. God bless you.❤🔥

https://youtu.be/TCSUKIhjevo
Every one in my family has died of cancer or addiction. Every day I wonder if they'll get me too. Thank you for this inspiring song Tom
😢great song Tom
A lot of truth in those lyrics! I lost my stepdad a couple years ago to cancer.
THANK YOU!!! I'm 48 years old and was diagnosed with Triple Negative Breast Cancer on July 31st. I started chemotherapy within 2 weeks. I will continue with weekly chemo until January. Followed by surgery and radiation because the risk of recurrence of TNBC is very high. Your words and this video made tears sting my eyes. Again.  Giving up is not an option no matter how shitty the "cure" makes me feel. I fight every single day for my 3 children!!!! #cancersucks #findafuckingcure
And this is why I love your
💙
Supression of cures is a real thing. My father quit teaching medical school over suppression of medicines and natural alternatives that work.  Spent the last 15 years of his life helping those with cancer and other incurables.    I continue to help those that want to know. Thank you so much Tom for bringing this out. Much love to you and yours. ❤
I've got a family of 7 and I take all the stress so I have so many mental problems but it makes me happy to know my family is happy :)
Who are these people disliking this song?
Thanx for this Tom 👍👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you for this. I have just been cleared of the dreaded word. I am healthy now. For those who are still fighting please check out myycancerstory.rocks. It's not my site but this helped me beat it and I do hope it helps you. My hair is growing back in now. I went from waist length hair to none. It is now reaching to the base of my neck. I'm happy it's coming back but it's totally different than it was.
Tom may not be able to say I’m Sorry and mean it but I do..JW
I loss two grandmas and a grandpa so far to cancer. 💚RIP to the loved ones lost and prayers for those still fighting thier battle!
Such a beautiful song <3..
Thank you so much for making this song Tom! You are a genius when it comes to making songs with such powerful lyrics! 👌🏼⭐️⭐️✨🙏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🇳🇴🇳🇴
Hemp oil with THC is known by everyone to cure cancer and many other diseases and veterans lives matter too so why isn't it legal yet Mr Trump
My great grandmother just passed from stage 4 lung cancer...
Thank you ..
Damn bro that touched my heart deep  I have 2 childhood cancer Survivors in my house. Everyone fight on!!!
he might not be the best in his field ....but his work is definitely best in his field
Well, this song kind of hits the pause button for anyone trying to hate on Tom.
Love this song I'm 36 mother of 2 teenage daughters. I'm a 1 year survivor of stage 3 Triple Negative Breast Cancer.
Lost my grandma and great grandpa to lung cancer. Shits real yo
Everybody in the comments seem to either have cancer or have someone who battled with it. This shit is messed up 🥺. It's more rampant than I actually thought.  Y'all will be fine ✊. Great song, Tom
I Lost my dad to cancer last year, its the worst thing to see someone have to fight such a horrible disease, you see how much of a fighter people can be when they are faced with such a difficult battle! I hope no one has to go through the pain I went through seeing it slowly take the man I look up to most in the world but unfortunately it’s a horrible reality that many families have to face😭
And also HIV man
What a powerful song Tom. Brought tears to my eyes
😢... im a cancer survivor. I was given a 13% living rate. I lost a leg and some of my lung from the battle. But I've been in remission for close to 10 yrs now! Love this song! HoG 4 life
Fuck this Chorus is so good 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lost my mom to cancer, I battled cancer and won my battle for me and my mom. I love you Mom Rest in love 💙
Great video Tom!!!! Always speaking power to truth!!!! Lets keep them great songs and videos coming!!!

This song means a lot to a lot of people very good song very good words great job bud keep it up all your songs and everything like that have a lot of meaning to you actually do the real life words that people are struggling through very great keep up the good work bud👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Thank u @tommacdonald & @ novarockofella!! My momma died of lung cancer 5 almost 6 years back. & she was in remission & coming back but the radiation started paralyzing her muscles. & I was her caretaker. By the time I talked her in2 going 2 the hospital she couldn't even hold her head up & I had 2 feed her! She coded the next morning after she got 2 the hospital. They brought her back but after that they told her it would keep happening so she signed a dnr. Toughest time of my life but I wouldn't trade that year I took care of her 4 nothing. But great song love it!! I was in tears just hearing it!!👏👏💯💯😥😥💥❤
Youre Legendary Bro!! Forever a fan
😭 Doctors said my mother in law had 5 years but maybe longer if they start chemo and radiation...started chemo and radiation and she died in 3 months... fu*k cancer and fu*k these doctors...she could've lived long enough to see my daughter graduate...
My best friend died of cancer.  He fought till the end. This song just made my cry. Fuck I miss that guy. Thanks Tom.
😭😭
This sir is by far your best song strongest message.
I didn’t expect this from you & I am sobbing at my office desk.  Keep fighting brother. We adore you out here
Man this song hits home. Most of my family has had cancer.  Thank you tom for making this. I can see the pain you show on your face threw the vid. I hope you stay strong to man. Much love
F Cancer
They have a cure for all cancer i am sure of it. But only the 1% get it because if we all were allowed to recieve it then the doctors and pharmacy companies wouldnt make money off of us anymore....there is a cure for everything. But to the 1% we are not worth recieving the vaccinations because then they wont be able to take all our money and keep us all poor and struggling! To many of my peeps have died from cancer so i love this song. Thank you brotha
Sadly they won't "find" a cure because there isn't any money in the cure. I lost my Aunt & Grandparents to cancer.
Damn. Just.... damn.
Whoa didn’t expect to shed a tear this year
Well done sir.
Hold up how come people dislike this song?
Damn I liked this song 🙏
R.i.p Eddie S  you fighted cancer untill the end you were a great friend and i miss you so much.  Thankyou tom for the song hit close to home x

You were right... I did cry 😢 good song man. You always have songs that pull the heart strings and emotions right out of people. Keep killin it big dawg. You and nova are blessed..
I’m not gonna claim to be your biggest fan but I do take the time to listen to your songs here and there, but this song legit made me cry. I lost my grandmother to cancer 2 years ago and I miss her so much. Thank you for this song Tom.
❤️❤️
Wicked song brother. I felt that one.
You said we would cry.....it got water out of my eyes brother. Great song and video. #HOGARMY4LIFE
Thanks for rapping about truths!!!
I lost my mom of brain cancer in 2013. And i miss her daily. And i believe to my core they have a cure. But the sad fact is there is more money in treatment than there is in cures. THANKS FOR THIS SONG MAN
Ovarian cancer survivor here since 2017!!!!
This made me cry.
Wow. Amazing. I don’t think you want it, but this could be Grammy nominated
Amazing... can totally relate to this. Hits home for sure.
My dad the strongest I know was taken by cancer. I love u dad n my prayers n thoughts going out to those affected by cancer. Both mentally n physically.
Thank you for making this song!
The cure is not a profitable as the disease.. Evil fucking world we live in
Hi,   Cancer is a very difficult topic to talk about, especially in terms of "cures". Yes, heavy investment is made, and tons of research goes into it. Though, it's really crucial to understand that cancer isn't just one sickness, it's thousands of sicknesses. There's a large number of different TYPES of cancers, and to find the CURE to all of them, is extremely hard, if not impossible.   Alongside the large number of different types of cancer, it's also very important to understand the large numbers of causation factors that led to the cancer, as well as previous individual history and sicknesses of comorbidity in the patient. All of these variables play a role in creating a "cure", which unfortunately is very complex and in order to study all of these variables, a ton of more research, has to be done.    In addition, regardless of contrary belief, a lot of scientists and researchers that dedicate their lives to cancer research are often affected with, or are affiliated with someone affected by cancer. They would never "hold back" a cure, for any sort of profit.  I can assure you that.   That aside, I'd like to put emphasis on eating a clean diet (unprocessed foods, balanced meals, high in antioxidants), participating in consistent exercise and healthy sleep habits, as well as various forms of meditation to ease the stress in our lives. Although this can't cure cancer, it will for sure reduce your risk of being sick with it.   Would love some more positive and productive discussion, feel free to reply!
WOW...Powerful.  Thank you Tom!!!!!
Couldnt help tearing up. Lost my aunt to Cancer.. I knew she could have lived but those around her slowly weakened her and eventually she just didnt wake up. Almost lost my mother to breast cancer too... Not something I wish on anyone.
my mother had breast cancer 4 times. thanks for this
We all know it's all the chemicals in the food. Not to mention the ones we run into in our daily lives.
The song is great and that slow part at the end was awesome!
Thats deep bro. 100% facts
My dad died of colon cancer when I was 15. Changed my life forever. Such a violent disease to watch a loved one go through. He was such a good man. I miss him everyday. ❤️
Cool to see you branching your platform to drop some knowledge on some really important subjects. Much respect 🔥😎
79k in 1 hour good job man
my family struggled with cancer and almost lost my aunt
Dude....you are a true talent. I applaud you for sitting down and writing this song. And I applaud you for the level of success you have achieved. Next time your in Phoenix, should you choose too, ya boy can show you some cool shit the desert hides from the snowbirds
you did it again tom you reminded me nvr quit i really needed this today ty love you guys nvr quit please we need more people like you and nova
For every illness theres a plant, cancer exist in a acidic environment. What we consume makes it a good home for cancer. Dr.sebi cured cancer and got killed.  I lost my grams to cancer and a aunt . This was a good song
Powerful - Inspirational - Hopeful......one of your best yet and a wakeup call to the establishment. We want a cure! Stop the profiteering off of suffering!
I’m in awe that was beautiful and inspiring!  Thank you! 🙏🏼
Wow !!!!! Tom Your lyrics are unbelievable and so warming keep carrying on with the most unique ID lyrics ever. Made love
Dam this hurts inside, It's true..
I recently lost my best friend/cuz to bone cancer and I got to say this songs really hits my emotions hard. Love this song
Spring 2019 my dad got diagnosed with a sublingual tumor. Between 30yrs of smoking and major exposure to agent orange in Vietnam he was at high risk anyway. With a sublingual it is consider stage 4, even if it is caught early because it is inoperable. So they started him on chemo and radiation. He took the chemo like a champ. Used thc lemon drop candies to help with the nausea and was doing great. The radiation though. It shut down his salivary glands, irritated the lining of his throat. He was down to a cup of beef broth a day and some water. He went from 230 to 160 in a few months. His body consumed his muscles for protein to keep going. He could barely stand. He ended up having to go into a convalescent center, and the first 2 weeks there he was totally despondent. He required a feeding tube. I thank God for our priest. Father Joseph came ever day, talked with dad, gave him confession and communion, gave him unction, prayed with and for him. That started the process of lifting him up and helped begin the healing dad needed. He is now cancer free. But he will tell you that the cure came closer to killing him than the disease.  He never did finish his radiation treatments.
IM CONFUSED AS TO WHY SOMEONE WOULD HIT DISLIKE!!!!!!!! CAN SOMEONE CLARIFY WHY ???????
Bro bro bro 😥😥😥😥😥😓😓😓😭😭😭😭😭😭😭I'm speechless
I've lost half my family to cancer, thanks for your words brother, means a lot 🙏
Thank you for this!  I lost my mom to cancer in September of '90 when I was 8, and my dad to cancer in August of '13 when I was 31.  You are right, I believe they do have cures.  And you are also right, the treatments can kill; my mom went through it, and because of how it destroyed her, my dad would not.
I just want to know who are the 92 people that gave this video a thumbs down 🤷😠
Cancer is curable but it doesn't make money if you know that I mean
THANK YOU BRO🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 STAY STRONG FIGHT EVEN STONGER
Your a strong man Homie keep going And u are going to be bigger

I lost my mom to Cancer this past December.  She was denied everything she needed to survive an live another day. I absolutely hate this corrupt system we call Government now days. I stand for my fellow Americans but I'll be Damned to watch these ppl suffer for the benefit of Man. What happened to our neighbors are our equal. Nahh not anymore. Money, power, and greed has tainted all above..

My Dad is dying from bone cancer. Drs told him he might make it 5 years. I'm crushed and there isn't anything I can do about it.
Man love this song just reminds  me  of my niece who passed from a bone cancer back in 2018...
Ironic I was just diagnosed with cancer in January and have been fighting it all year the battles almost over for me as I win
I had Hodgkins Lymphoma at ages 6, 9, 11, and 21. It's still a struggle today. I love the lyrics of this song. Here is a song I originally did for the Hope Lodge where I stayed during my bone marrow transplant in 1998. https://soundcloud.com/ryan-hamner-2/where-hope-lives
Bro I got rid of cancer.... I was free from the pain and the evil within but todays the day I’m sick an now my prostate is a victim to this cancer ITS HORSESHIT! Sitting in this COvId situation mixed  loneliness it’s amazing how I go from great health with Perfect blood to WOOAH BABY!  Is it 5G or aliens I guess I won’t know but then you drop this song today and now I don’t feel so alone  —M.I.K.E—
This hits hard🙏💯🔥
Anyone that is not producing within the medical field needs to be fired. Insurance companies, politicians that protect them, the lobbyist, the &^#$% charities that promote awareness, so more people can watch the sick die. So many people exploiting the industry. Such a big ^%#$ mess, few can guess why it is not working. Its simple, tare down the crap they built up. Get the politicians and insurance companies out of the picture, we don't need their help, they are only helping themselves in the end.
Wow Tom. Beautiful <3
Bro this is beautiful, so much heart in this song and its absolutely amazing. Keep doing you man cause everything you do is gold much love
Best one yet.
It's wat more then just about money. That's why I think it's so funny how the democrats use abortion laws to scare us. It's population control. They need drugs, abortion,  cancer etc to help keep the population down. Why you thinl all those democrats broke citys stuck youngs covid people with old covid people? To kill off the most needy expensive burdon on the government
omg tom thank you for this song!  My moms been fighting forever against cancer!  Much love brother!
How does this video have dislikes!?!? Haters will hate no matter what I guess
That’s an amazing song and I will pray for all of those who need it
This song is so strong.  Thank you again
This is something absolutely powerful. You sir are one of the greatest men alive putting out music that not only has meaning and something real but also something that points lights to issues swept under the rug that no one wants to be seen. For never meeting you and only hearing your words you have so much respect for what you do from many many people. Thank you for being you and being a real role model for people in this world who are afraid to stand and be different. There are plenty of bullshit artists that only care about the money and how they can make more and corrupt little girls and boys to be obsessed with beauty and hoes and drugs and partying. Thank you tom mcdonald.
Tom you are my favorite rapper you always hit home hard. Hope this video becomes number 1 in views
Tom McDonald is one the best artist in the world his lyrics are so powerful keep. up the good work

TO MY SON WHO PASSED AT 6 YEARS OLD I LOVE YOU BABY DADDY STILL SAYS A BAD WORD TO THE (🖕🏼CANCER) THAT TOOK YOU HOME BEFORE YOUR TIME👼🏽🙏🏼... I PLAY THIS SONG FOR YOU... AND ONE DAY WE WILL MEET AGAIN 🙏🏼👼🏽😇🦅
What an awesome song to lift us up in the hard ass times we live in today! Thank you Tom, Nova and Logan! You are all such amazing humans and it shows in your work! ❤🥰❤
Sadly it’s because it’s actually illegal to cure cancer and disease in the USA. Big pharma runs this shit and it’s ridiculous. Awesome song man!
How could anyone dislike this.....
I am so ugly crying right now! I lost my mother in 2013 to cancer and in 2015 I was diagnosed with cancer! I fought like hell & became one of the lucky one's to join the survivors club! I will be 5 years in remission on Feb 5th 2021!
My husband is fighting rare form of brain cancer called Chordoma , inoperable and incurable , proton radiation was to buy him time 🙏
Fookin banger 🔥 never stop being real tom
I have 2 family members battling cancer
Video and song are heart breaking!!  Probably won’t be a chart topper competing against mindless fluff. Hits the mark so hard will be around forever just based on the strength of messaging. Exactly what music is supposed to be.
I bought your CD with this song on it. Watching the vidoe makes it more meaningful. It is nice to see the caring side of you through your song. Someone told me that same thing. That cancer does have a cure and that it is being hidden from us. That same person said the cure will be come public. I don't know when.  I  🙏 that is the truth. A lot of people need it. I love the video Tom and Nova.
Fucking love this
WOW MOVED TO TEARS MR MACD!! Thank you for putting lyrical courage out there for those of us who have been touched by this disease. Whether you have it yourself or someone close to you - your words have hit very close to home for all of us. Cancer doesn't discriminate but faith can be universal. Well done sir!
How does this video have 75k views but only 15k likes we need to bump these numbers up
The problem with cancer is that year after year our natural immune system is bombarded with crap ranging from the things we consume to the things we put on our body. Reason why cancer is so prevalent now is because our immune systems are too weak to remove cells that are mutated. If you have a healthy immune system, it will detect mutated cells and send the appropriate antibodies to deal with it. But because most people are some sort of immune compromised, the body has a lot tougher of a time to remove these cells. The body is an amazing thing when it comes to healing itself, but if you don't take care of your  body, how will it be able to take care of you?
Beautiful brother 👏👏👏
This is a heart touching song your best song ever. I love a lot of your songs. But no diss, to your other songs but they don’t even hold a candle to this song. People need this realization. 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Thank you bro😭
Another slapper Tom. Such a powerful message on such a tough subject. Hats off
I’ve got two things to say! First, Can this man make a bad song? Everything he makes is pure genius. Second, where is 87 people that disliked this so I can slap them!
Don’t know what to say..... other than ...thank you Tom!
My soulmate died from cancer and I miss him so freaking much.
I don't care what anybody says Tom is a genius he goes from making songs like people so stupid people so dumb to making this song like this speaking about the facts
My dad just passed away from cancer after a year and a half battle. This song made me cry but I'm glad you wrote it Tom. Makes me love the  moments I had with my dad even more.
https://youtu.be/aBvyKE2jKME

My oldest daughter fought brain cancer at 12yo. This track brought back ALL the feels man! She won her battle thank God, but thank you for making music with MEANING. Not just this one, but all of your music adds something to the world. Just got 4 signed CD's. Really nice touch too.  Wish there were more like you Tom. ✌
Capitalism and health don't do good together .
This song is nothing short of a masterpiece
I said it before and I’ll say it again, you and Nova are a beam of light that this world needs right now.
Damn this song made me miss my dad
My mom survived breast cancer, then as a result of her treatment she got stage 3 uterine cancer, while she was doing chemo I was diagnosed with stage 1 cervical cancer. We lost her to cancer 3 1/2 years ago.
Damn.  Hits home
Thank you Tom
Grandparents, aunts, uncles, mom, dad and brother all gone to cancer. Thank you. ❤️
Cancer has hit my family hard over the years. A total of five people in my life have died from it. The worst one is my father's death. He died back towards the end of March due to lung cancer. Now one of my cousins has cancer.
Grandma was the first one I knew to die from cancer. I've seen many vets struggle with it since then from Agent Orange to the Burn Pits.
This got me teary eyed. Beautiful, Tom.
As of right now, 89 people on youtube suck. My mom beat this shit but there are plenty of people who don't. Thank you Tom for another perfect social commentary on more of the b.s. going on in the world.
Dam..this was a tear jerker..big props Tom
Perfectly righteous brother
this one really touches home bro
I just got out of the vets office, had to put my dog down after a short fight with lymphoma. It's like the world wanted me to hear this right now.
Tom this song hit me right in the heart, I've lost to many people to this horrible disease peace and love brother peace and love
The people that dislike are literal cancer
Whose cutting onions??
Deserves all the love in the world
Anyone who have lost someone and listen to Tom McDonald songs ....i believe they  are resting well with the MAKER because i know the good people loves TOM MCDONALD SONGS
Hard hitting masterpiece! Very well done Tom! ****IN CASE ANYBODY"S INTERESTED**** Research Bee Propolis (red, brown and I think green) this is a natural inhibitor to cancer. There are ways to treat these big money conditions just by doing a little digging on the internet. Big Pharma and the Clinton Foundation back when the Clinton's were a thing, they were scrubbing the internet to do away with anything that would negatively affect their bottom line. There is a book called *THE VAULT* it has these such natural remedies in it and not for very much money, it can be found online. I will also say that cancer is not of God, so prayer against cancer would be putting the patient in agreement with the Father. Command that which is not of God to leave in Jesus Name and it will have to leave, don't give up or grow weary...too often this is life or death and there are times where we get blindsided when there was more that could have been done, what I am getting at is Jesus did say that, those who follow after Him, will be able to do any number of things He did and more...to include the raising of the dead, but don't take my word for it, look it up for yourselves.
So many of us know someone who has battled cancer if we haven't ourselves. "You are a fighter when it's dire. You are brighter when it's dark." Inspired. The ones who fight and the ones who stand with them. So true. God bless you Tom. You are reaching so many with your gifts and talents.
Beautiful Tom & Nova God bless ❤️🙏
My mom fought cancer and she won thank you for putting this out there for the people that win and for all the people out there that lose my heart goes out to you
This hit me pretty hard as I just lost my mother March 23rd to Ovarian cancer. Thank you for all you do and keep up the hard work
I dont understand how anyone could dislike this
GREAT STRONG WORDZ YO     WHOOP WHOOP!!
i hope the dislikes were actual victims that think it is insentive or god help us
Yet again!!!! Tom slays it!   I’m not surprised anymore.   He’s gonna lay 💯 down every time.   Just expect ppl.  He’s a beast! Love you tom
You were right. I totally cried! My mom and Sister-in-law are both Cancer Survivors!! Thank you so much! I absolutely love this and shared it everywhere!
I 1st heard this when i bought your  autographed cd's. It touched me, but when my aunt called me last week to tell me that there's nothing that the doctors can do any further for my cousin Jenny,    I listened to it again and BAWLED like s baby! THE WHOLE TIME! Thank you Tom for spitting the truth, for being my voice & my feelings! Thank you!
There is no money in it for Big Pharma’ to cure cancer. Their literary getting rich off the sick. Im sure the cure is out there, but it’s being suppressed.
Wow. 😢 I am at a loss for words. Much love for this.
Tom I don't know if you read these comments, but this is the first time I ever commented on a YouTube Video. I'm currently battling Cancer myself going through the treatments and bills and not knowing how long I do have and everything that comes along with it, so this song really hit's home. Thankyou so much! your lyrics even in all your songs speaks the truth, but unfortunately it falls on too many deaf ears.
Thank you for the inspiration Tom!
Wow
this really hurts bc one of best friends has cancer and hes only 14 and the doctors told him last year he has at most 15 years to live
I love you guys. Thank you
I just lost my grandmother on the 2nd and my grandfather on the 6th of this month both to cancer. I appreciate you more than you'll ever know Tom. Thank you. Ill never be able to repay you for what you've done and you don't even know man. You guys are gods sent
Bro I got fam who got cancer & had cancer & whoever got cancer they r fighters & they my fam
I will step up and take any of my friends or family place against cancer.
How do people even hate on Tom? He's such a nice guy and only wants to speak the truth.
Really love this song. The metabolic approach to cancer is so important, the Warburg effect is real. The genetic approach has failed miserably and is used to keep milking the proletariat for $$$$$$! Thanks pharma.
My goodness! Love this definitely have tears 😢 not many words I can say, much love an respect Tom. 💙🔥💯🎯
Lost my grand father to cancer. Took his life quick once it appeared. He the reason i love spicy food. He was my best friend bc i could call him anytime i needed advice and its upsetting that he went but ik there was nothing that coulda been done to help him. It was a rare cancer that doctors couldnt detect but once they found it it was too late. It sucks and my heart goes to anyone who suffers through it. ik i had hard times facing how bad shape my grandfather was. He was who held the family together and brought everyone together during holidays. Now that hes gone my family hasnt ever been more broken apart. Thanks Tom this song is sure to help alot of people in a time of need.
Amazing. I'm glad you choose to share this one with those who don't have the albums, maybe they will realize the albums are in fact amazing and worth every penny.
I had to watch my mother die from this. Hardest thing I had to go thru yet. Some of her meds were like $ 15,000.00 a bottle, I kid you not. It's horrible how they bleed you for every penny that they can before you die.
Love it
Love this praying I haven't gotten my breast cancer back
This is straight FACTS.
Tom McDonald is the best rapper alive!! Bc eminem died years ago and we are stuck with his clone!!
There is to much money to be made by keeping people sick. I guarantee there is a cure for cancer.
Thank you for this song Tom. #fuckcancer
This hits home hard for me. Thanks for your heart, I can feel the emotions in your song. Again, THANK YOU 💯💯
My mom she was my bestfriend!! Its been almost 3 years but it feels like yesterday!! The pain couldn't be more real!!! I will see her again!!!
Thank you for this song!
I love how you picked an oldie to make a video on, next can we have naz, or i dont rule the world
This. This hit home, started crying watching this. Thank you.
❤❤❤🥰
The financial struggles during the emotional and painful body struggles the image struggles it’s all so hard thank you for showing the world what’s really going on all the time. I did all my treatments But they can’t tell me if I’m cancer free because my insurance won’t do a pet scan it’s like $6000 unless I have some kind of symptom of cancer but how can I have symptoms of cancer if I did all my treatments but how do I know if I am cancer free if you don’t check me. Thank you for this beautiful song can’t wait for the next one.
I like the song I just didn't cry like you said everyone would
Great song
Where's the love button?    Respect!  🔥❤
Love it. had some family members die from cancer. not going to lie I teared up a little awsome job tom and nova
My mother is a breast cancer survivor and my sister is a previvor. Amazing song.
Lost my wife at a young age due to fuckin cancer.. the only saving grace was watchin my two kids grow up and see some of her traits in them. This song was like a boot in the balls and it made me cry... im not ashamed in any way... love the song
TOM BROTHA YOU SPEAK SO MUCH THRUTH. MY father in law passed to cancer and it was shit for everyone involved.
Man Tom that was strong; I wanna cry now. I know so many that have been affected by cancer in fact my mother in law and brother in law are both survivors thanks for this beautiful song
Thank you for making this... It's heart warming.  I lost my mother in 2011 to Leukemia.  Everyone out there, I know it's hard, but please, go on living for the sake of your loved ones.
Cancer stole my dad 2012 is a fucking bad thing to get this pice of shit thanks tom you are a very good Person bless you ❤ HOG4LIFE
1. Cancer is genetic because vaccines cause cancer ...they eff up our genes and we pass these genes onto the next gen. 2. Chemotherapy is the worst thing for cancer. Under 18 years old and you have NO say nor do your parents. Your body  is owned by the system.  3. "D" is for Doctor or Devil? Because most people are dying thanks to the narcissistic mainstream medical community who think they are mini gods.   4. There is a cure - stay away from these Doctors. Go to holistic Doctors who know how the body actually works.
Big Pharma
WOW
Tom Macdonald = The only rapper in the game saying anything worth listening to. FACT!! 💯
I LOVE YOU .... GOD BLESS YOU  ..... THANK YOU  .....
Umm the medicines to fight and kill the disease are really hard to make so yes it costs a lot .  the profit motive makes it impossible to stop.  Yes we are killing ourselves the way we treat the planet and ourselves.  This is a heartfelt exclamation tom.  Thank you for making it
Good job mate been waitin
Rick Simpsons oil or rso is known to kill 17 different types of cancer but let's keep cannabis illegal.
This hit a lil bit 2 hard. Grandma in hospital, coughing blood because of cancer. Cant visit her cus Rona either...
I was just coming to youtube with this thought...I need some new Tom MacDonald
So true. Sad business rip grandma miss ya lost her too Cancer 💔🙏❣️
Tom McDonald is the realest rapper 💯🙏🏻
85 heartless people disliked this song at the time of this comment

My brother was just given 6 months.. THANK YOU FOR THIS😪💯
Amazing track. Don't know how anyone with a heart could thumbs down this
Not gonna lie...I couldn't finish the video. As a parent, this hurts my heart.
I’ve been waiting for this music video since I got gravestones! Thank you Tom 🙏
Veganism is the cure....
Though provoking and real respect
Wow dog perfect timing in my life for this song.  thanks for keeping it real  it does help. we will always have your back too.
I liked this video as soon as it started and when it finished I wish I could give it 2 likes, your the best. You keep doing you man.
Damn tom. Got me crying on my lunch break. Felt that in my bones
Have lost too many friends to cancer. And know a lot who have fought it and won only to have it come back. I hate this disease.
Love it .... hands down
You kill every song!
I’ve lost 4 family members to cancer
Our medical community doesn't care about people, they care only about money. I refuse to wear pink in October just so that cancer "research" can make more money while more and more people die everyday. These are rackets designed to play on people's emotions and we all need to wise up!
You're a very good man Tom!!!
Wow... just wow... always putting out outstanding music. 👏 HOG
I lost my aunt to cancer 3 years ago tomorrow. This song hits home hard
Magnificent
You are awesome. Everything you write has meaning and clarity. My sister and are hooked on Tom Macdonald . I also think you're Sexy. I love your music!!

Absolute fire 🔥 what a message 👏
8 years ago, on exactly this day, I buried my mom because of cancer. I lost it when I heard the song on the cd a few weeks ago. I can’t bring myself to watch the video. Much love Tom.
I love this guy. Excellent song. Just excellent. 🤘🤘🤘🤘
My Mom bounced back from thyroid cancer a few years ago, and she contracted Covid while caring for the elderly. Shes survived again and again. She's incredibly tough.
Thank you Tom, just thank you
Thank you.  A good friend's daughter has CANCER.  They found out last month.  She is 2 years.  YOUR SONG WILL COME AT THE RIGHT TIME.  Thank you from Dresden in Germany.
so my grandma died a couple years back of cancer and this song hit me so hard in the feels because i was a kid back then and she basically always kept smiling whenever we were near. but now i think about it and you could definetly see that she was exhausted of fighting it. she was 55. R.I.P.
This man is a credit I'm such a big fan . TOM MCDONALD IS THE G.O.A.T
Crying
Great song!....i lost my sister and dad in the same year from cancer....keep up the good work!👍
My dad was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago. He's been fighting and we finally see some light at the end of all of this. My dad is the stro gest person I know. Even while going through it all, he still has a smile on his face. Love the song, hits that warm spot. Keep up the amazing work, and Fuck Cancer!
My little sisther has cancer :'( shes only 9
Stronger together
My sis needs this
Another kickass bomb mr macdonald
Thank you for this! I was diagnosed in 2013, tried to commit suicide 2014, started chemo 2016.. waiting for a possible clinical trial for my cancer it’s called systemic mastocytosis... and never been able to relate to a song about the battle ever before now! Thank you for my new anthem.
Well done
I love the song by the way Just a suggestion could you make a song about it MS ( Multiple sclerosis)
Another reason Tom is one of the greatest. He puts out music that inspires, cultivates, questions society, fights back, and he puts out what he believes in.  Keep doin you Tom, we got your six while you set out on a mission to be the greatest.
My father in law passed away at 45 4 years ago from cancer, only knew him for a year and that was the hardest thing I witnessed. He was a great man and pains me that he wont be there to see his grandchildren grow up, thabkyou for this song❤❤
Thank you for this song and video. It speaks to everyone on one level or another. I saw in the comments that someone referred to it as an anthem. I totally agree, it's a fight song for those battling cancer as well as the loved ones battling from the sidelines. As always it also hits on the tragic truth behind the cancer industry! Again thank you and much love to you and Nova.  #HOGFOREVER
This guy really shows the bitter truth of the world.very rare to see guy like him.great work brother  You are just amazing
THANK YOU TOM!  My older sister (40) is dying of metastatic breast cancer. I've been convinced they have a cure but they make more money treating it than curing it. I'm bawling buckets. Thank you so much. Edit: I've watched this three times and still can't quit crying. I don't want my sister to die
Fuck Cancer my dad just had go back on chemo they will never release the cure it’s bringing them a lot of money. Money is root of all evil
Tom you did it,you made me cry listening to this,from personal experience,thank you Tom for making the music we need
Not sure how you do it Tom, but you’ve done it again. Another stellar video and the lyrics are incredible. Keep it up brotha.
HCQ and alkaline water. Vitamin c and d exercise. Also tesla had a machine to cure it. Also look into Edmonton university Dca look up.
Great song keep it up tom 👍 👍 👍
Love this one Tom.😘
My mom has cancer, she has done chemo twice. Most recently they just put a stint in her chest.  It's fucking scary man.. I don't want to lose my mom yet
That current like to dislike ratio,  it's well merited with this record,  but still,  never  seen that much positivity on a Tom Macdonald video pretty much ever
!!!!!!!!!!GOAT!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow! I was NOT expecting this! Fantastic job Tom !!!
You weren't lying, I'm in tears. I've lost 2 family members and my best friend to cancer over the last 4 years. Watching them dying from the "cure" that's supposed to keep them from dying. The most difficult is when they go into remission, moods and sprits lift. Then it comes back like a runaway freight train. Thank you Tom. Love you brother.
Damn. Stay strong all! I've lived cancer, while I've lost loved ones to cancer. Stay strong and fight hard!!!
Kill it bro they don't wanna give us cure but they have it
👍😭😭💖💋
I lost my grandfather 2 years ago to brain tumors. The chemo killed him faster than the cancer would have. In just 4 months, i saw him go from walking, being a pallbearer at his best friends funeral, to becoming a shell of a person who didnt even look like himself anymore. I still miss him dearly. Thank you for this song. He really fought, but chemo kills more than just cancer cells.
Been fighting cancer for over 2years now, thanks brother you made me feel better, thank you for caring,love ya man
Thank you tom for this.i lost my sister in 2017 to this horrible disease.love them while you still can because you never know when they will be gone.
4th time replaying this
Chemotherapy only works on 3 to 5% of all cancer patients but the doctors keep pushing it cuz it gets such a big bonus and pay by keeping people on it something that only works 3 to 5% of the time
You are by far my favorite artist, I have  cervical cancer and yet its not far enough along to treat according to the doctors 🤷‍♀️
Thank you Tom man my best friend has battled cancer since a kid and he’s battling with it again as we speak. And I’ve lost 60% of my loved ones to this shit 😭.
Good song. But whoever did the make up on that little girls forehead should find another job.
One of my favorite songs on the album
thanx bro. that hit home tears n all.
Anyone that has watched a loved one fight this it's a crushing thing to see but it also shows you how strong they are. When you watch them stare down death and fight like a cornered animal you gain a whole new perspective on what real strength is. I've seen people fight it with treatment and I've seen people not get any at all for it and both sides of that coin were some of the strongest people you could ever meet.  For you who have lost someone, I'm sorry for your loss and for the ones fighting it know you are some of the strongest people on the planet and I hope for all the best for you.
YES!
We all felt every word of this anthem
One love
Powerful song...
RSO
Ive lost my Father to Cancer. Love the song Tom!! Oh and you right they shld have a cure but their no money in the cure! The money is in the medicine.
Honestly this song made me cry soooo good tom and nova 🔥 🔥 🔥 #fuckcancer  #hog #anthem
My uncle a few months ago died from liver cancer and 2 days after my dad died from an OD, needless to say I know how it feels to loose someone from an illness. Prayers to anyone who has lost a loved one and may god be with you.
That was amazing and yes I cried because I lost my grandma's to lung cancer cancer in 1996 and I lost my Aunt Angel last year. so yes just touch home. And it's a great anthem for those who are still fighting the fight. and ur lyrics are so true.  it's all an industry keeping people sick to keep the rich, rich.  it's like the world has Munchausen syndrome
My uncle was  diagnosed with cancer after he got done home for the Vietnam war and he has cancer today but it's clearing up and I have to have I surgery on my eye where the cut under my eye or I'll go blind 😔
🤙🏻
Take her for a ride in the Aventador and come be part of what Witness Riders is about.  We look forward to you, riding with us.
Amazing, man. Thank you so much for making this.
Y 83 dislikes....butt 😢 y....not cool folks
Just when I thought I'd lost hope for this world you come along with hope and truth and now look at this following bro you move ppl glad I found your music look forward to the next
I just say wow 🙏 . Love from india brother
my grandfather was recently diagnosed with lung cancer and my dads had skin and testicular cancer and my mawmaw had breast cancer and my mom had to have a preventative surgery for it. cancer has taken jts toll on my family and i wish the corporations werent so greedy.
Say No to Radiation... Ignorence and follishness is breeding ground for cancer.  Forgive.. And Forget... Then RSO...
Thank you for this song and video,  there is so much truth in what you are saying.. preach it brother
😞😞😞😞😊😊😊awesome tom as always 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Tom, I have loved all your music since the first song I heard and have had mad respect for you but this song in my opinion is the realest out there and the best song you have ever made keep it up bro!
I survived bone cancer when I was 15 and this song is amazing and relatable for someone like me
Just want to take a second to point out Tom has the most positive comments section on YouTube. Keep uplifting the people Tom wish there were more like you 💯
Thank you for creating this.  This one is your Grammy ❤️
When the medical industry is about making money not helping people.
I'm praying for everyone battling cancer right now I pray that you can fight that you have the strength to fight it that you may find some kind of comfort and strength
Thank you.
Thank you for this song Tom.    My remission date; 08/09/2009.

Song hit home for sure Tom I lost my dad to cancer hardest thing I’ve ever had to go through watching it eat him alive but he fought until his last breath! Thank you Tom for your music and messages
I lost my son last year to cancer on October 18th,  he fought it but it won out, I want to thank you for this song, I’ve thought a lot this past year about the very same thing you sing about, all the money spent over all the years and people are still dying from all kinds of cancer, thanks for giving it a voice so more people can start thinking and asking why we’re still losing so many lives to cancer.
Song so damn good I wanted to listen to more versus and shit lol. Amazing like always Tom and Nova. Love you two and stay safe.
Damn Tom, you squeezed my heart, which made my eyes water. So true Brother! Thank you and Nova

My uncle literally just got diagnosed with what is most likely terminal lung cancer a few days ago, crazy that you would release this now. Amazing song man.
Fuck cancer. This hits to close, took my dad from me, 9-21-17. His birthday is 10-30. Its a rough month, I thank you deeply for this
This brought tears
It is very easy to criticize the medical fraternity 🙄
Straight fire! 🔥
Never heard of you; my friend sent me this. It’s so true. Thank you ❤️ from a cancer fighter, stage 4 ✌️
Gave me tears brother...... I want a huge now...
Wao bro' :/ I feeling the pain.
Bro, that hit the feels man...
Love this song Tom. Thank you for bringing this issue to the forefront. There are a lot of people that really need this song right now. It's hitting me really hard right now because my husband is an ALL Leukemia survivor and he has to see a cancer doctor every six months to make sure his Leukemia hasn't returned. On top of all of that, four years ago today my husband's father lost his battle with stage 4 colorectal cancer. My husband and I wish he was still here everyday. Love what you and Nova are doing. You guys are an inspiration to a lot of people including me. Keep doing you. Love you! HangOverGang for life!🤘
God bless you Tom☮️💜🙏
Here within the first hour 🙏🙏🎶💯great message bro . Like of you agree
thank you sooo much for this my daughter who is 12 has been fighting for almost 5 years and will always be at risk to relap's for the 6th time with no treatment options left
Goddamn that made me feel some shit.. Wtf tom it seems like you get better by every song
Looking for a banger. .....  Cry like a bitch..... It's a banger anyway.  Love this on Gravestones but Flowers for the Dead is Fantastic as well.
Cried*......can't say much more...besides I felt that
Thank you for this one means a lot to me tbh my uncle just passed from that shit🙏🤘🏻
Damn this hit the feels
Thank you for this song my aunt is fighting Cancer for the second time I really hope she beats it again.
💗
Thank you🙏
The hardest thing in my life was to watch my little girl fight cancer.  Thanks be to God she is healthy and cancer free.
Thank you Tom. I lost my Mom to cancer. You’re right. She was fire and her candle burned brightest during her fight. I will always rage against the dying of the light
This man is truly a blessing. Helps us se the bigger picture
NOTHING you have put out has ever disappointed me. In my top 3 artist for sure
Wow I’m speechless
Made my wife cry , we all know someone goin through it . Love and prayers to anyone who is , stay strong have hope
I’ve Been saying we have a cure for years.. all about profit 😔
Bro goosebumps the whole time
Imagine being the POS to dislike this video
Wow bro! Wow! I knew once I saw that title this song would be hella deep. Every song you write Tom carries a major message and I can’t thank you enough for just being YOU. This song hit me hard bc I lost my grandma a few years ago to a diagnosis of cancer out of the blue. Never smoked or nothing. Miss the hell outta her to this day. This song can’t be anymore true. So Tom I wanna personally say THANK YOU. This song amazing, epic and beautiful. Keep up the awesome work my man!
This one broke my heart.  Damnit my eyes are leaking
"u won't know why u have faith til u look the devil in his face" all the words in this song Tom are coming from somewhere as if it's a message to the world. If you can't hear what is being said . Listen 👂 write it down ✍️ and say it back and think about what it means 🤔 💭 and let it register in your mind 🧠 sometime it may seem like this 🤯 because the truth is mind blowing .. cheers
Prayers for anyone fighting this , don't stop fighting
This was beautiful.
Hard to see the video thru the watery eyes.  Love ya Tom.  I’ve lost my dad, my mom, my aunt... I don’t give a shit about COVID.  This is the issue I care about.
Ok tom is it you or nova?
I hear your words my friend  my farther passed  away threw this ugly  word, carnt even say the word I hate this word
Great song. It takes people with money fighting a government not joining them. It takes people with money not a government stealing your money.
wow yep I officially just cried
Tom,   Thank you.
This is the Tom mcdonald I fuckin love not that other shit man honestly this hit bro Gonn a support u either way 👍👍
This video is so powerful!! Like you say in the song, everyone is touched by cancer.  It’s absolutely unacceptable that we don’t have a cure. My daughter was diagnosed with osteosarcoma (bone cancer) in 2000 when she was 8 years old.  Though she lost her leg, she is now 29 and doing great.  This songs brings me right back to 2000 and the terror of going through such a horrendous left-changing ordeal.    Tom thank you so much for touching on subjects that really matter!!  HOG Forever!!
My Girlfriend and mother to my child, lost her mom this Tuesday to Cancer...I really want her to hear this, in time...thank you Tom, your an amazing person!
Bro. This song hit hard for me 🤧
Thank you bro you are inspiration to all of us keep the good work going
Thank you Tom for this my wife was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer a couple years ago  out of no we’re at the age of 35 we have a nine-year-old daughter And our lives have been upside down and torn apart but on the upside my wife has beat cancer but we’re still dealing with the lifelong side effects people think just because you beat cancer you’re OK but your life is changed forever I just want to thank you for this song thank you for your music I understand you
I found out I had cancer when I was 24. Im one of the lucky ones they got it and Ive been in remission for 12 years. Its a genetic cancer so the chances of it coming back in some other part of my body is very likely. But I dont ponder on the thought or fear it. I try to live my best life and know that Im a survivor. Thank you for this song God bless you and everyone who suffers from or has a loved one suffering from cancer
The Song Is Wonderful And It Touches A Person's Heart Because Everything You Say Is True I Shared It With My Parents Because My Mom Has Throat Cancer Thank You For Being An Amazing Artist My Friend Told Me About Your Music And Since Then I Always Listen To It And Follow Your Music
Just found out my brother has cancer two days ago. Im scared and hope he beats this. Thank you for this I really need it right now keep us in ur prays he is a fighter he's got this.
Wow bro that hit hard 😪😪😭😭🤧🤧👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼much respect and ty
People I lost to cancer: My dad His dad(grandpa) My step mom Grandpa on moms side My father in law. This is a big fear of mine. They went from them to nothing. I miss them everyday. Life isnt the same without them.
There was a cancer cure found, it was published in several scientific papers then just magicly dissapeared..... fuck big pharma
Respect to Tom for keepin the message real. #Gravestones #deaththreats #ghoststories The AEGIS Alliance's Response to Tom MacDonald's Gravestones Song https://youtu.be/KJ8BYlaBJlk
That's beautiful man.my mom deal with that shit lately. Love your music bruh.hangover gang for life
I remember seeing your post on fb the other day saying how it will make you cry....fuck you for making me cry like a baby back bitch 😂😂 but on a real note, absolutely fucking AWESOME song like every other one! Hands down definitely became one of my new favorites (castle is still prob my #1 favorite) but this hit home hard. My moms been battling stage 4 breast cancer for going on 9 years and has been kicking its ass staying on medication and I gotta remind her sometimes “your a strong as fuck woman and too damn stubborn and hard headed to let any pussy shit like this get you!” Because for someone to battle something like cancer, and still kick ass and take names?! That’s one bad mother fucker!!!
Going through some bad stuff huh?
Definitely an instant classic, very real. Raw even.   I felt this song, Fight on, Everyone ❤💚❤
I've been dealing with too many friends and family lost to cancer over the years... Hearing this song has given me a sense of comfort that they didn't give up, they fought hard til the end
This song makes such a powerful statement! It’s so true and I can feel your passion while you’re singing it 💯💯💯🙏🙏🙏
cancer took one of my favorite yt content creator.. though we never met, ive always learn important things while watching him do his shit.. thanks for this :)
I was even prepared but still cried 😭
Just found out my Dad has inoperable Cancer. :-(
Top class again 🙏🙏🙏
Never stop speaking!!! Love you tom HOG❤❤❤
Tom MacDonald speaks so much truth, one of my favorite artists. Great song🤘🏼
This will trend high, calling it now
As a cancer survivor thank you Tom this hit hard
ALL I GOT IS PHAUCQN WOW <3 :(  :)
This is one of the best songs of 2020
Wise 🙏🏽 ❤️ shout out to you Tom
For anyone doubting, no, there's no cure, there are attempt and there are hundreds of variations of cancers. Im sorry but that's the only truths, we won against many types but we have a long way to go, prevention is the best we can do right now
This... this is amazing
My mom just died of cancer and damn this hit me so hard im crying  my eyes out
Nova and Tom, thanks!!!
(╯︵╰,) thank you Tom.
Tom you are a fucking lyrical genius. Keep making music man, big love!!
THIS matters
I'm in TEARS! That touched me so deeply Tom, thankyou.
Both my dad and brother have both fought stage 4 cancer. My dad died 3 days after Christmas due to complications from the Cancer treatments and my brother is currently in remission but he's scared 24/7 that's its going to return for a third time. I hate seeing my brother live in fear rather than living his life. Prayers up to those still fighting!!!  Edit: My brother lost his battle 8 months ago. It wasn't the cancer that took him... it was the complications from the Cancer treatments that took their toll on his body and he just couldn't come back from it all. I would give anything to still have him and my dad here with me. I miss them horribly.
If this song doesn't choke you up. I'll just leave it at that. Another awesome song brother
WOW...
Just shared this with 3 family members, I LOVE THIS SONG ❤️  😍 ❣️.
Dam.... I don't have it but my mom and grandma do they both have 1 but you put me in their shoes... thank you tom nova n  the man above for my mom and grandma
Another Great video. Keep up the good work. #HOG
Ineffable

This is so good tom! Thank u for this!
You are a great person Tom!
Lost my dad 8 years ago...Could have used this then...Love you all...
Thank you brother you are the real mvp love ya ❤️
Damn that hit the feeling hard having lost many great people I know to cancer.
Tom Macdonald doing work for all of us using his platform to exploit all the corrupt shit that we as a society don’t have a voice for. God damn Tom i appreciate you and nova for all the work and words you give to us to keep moving forward.  Keep up the great work bro 🤘🏻
thnk you so much tom!!!! i feel much better. and i can not wait to show this to my mom who has stage three breast cancer and stage one kidney cancer. i hope this encourages her to fight harder cause she has nearly given up.... thank you SOOO much tom!!!!! HANG OVER GANG FOR LIFE!!!!!!
This song represents why I love Tom! Music with purpose and meaning is what we need and why Tom can succeed when others fail! Huge shot out to you and Nova!
Straight up got a 32 year old "straght white male" bawling his eyes out. Beautiful song sir. Beautiful.
Tom you have such a big heart brother! This straight up has me in tears.. my grandfather died because of cancer and I too have had these thoughts! I love you dawg you are the absolute truth ❤️
Lost mom to breast cancer when i was 10. 1 day at a time. Gotta make em proud. Amazing song.
"We get cancer from keeping all our demons a secret" damn man.... hitting home again. Thank you, Tom. I'm gonna see to it that we Link up someday, we have way to much in common not too!
Tom, it seems to me that this song hits you more then most of yours do... i hope whoever it may be that is suffering has the strength to go on and continue to fight... and everyone else who has or has had someone battle this disease please stay strong and never give up. Individually we may be weak but together we are STRONG!!!!
Another beautiful job. ♥️
Love you 🔥
My grandma passed away from cancer 4 years ago. This song really hit home
My grandmother had cancer she kept fighting  for 4 years each time they gave her x amount of months left to live she out lived it  sadly she passed away last year this song really hits different than you tom
This hit hard for me as well. My grandmother passed from lung cancer, she passed in her sleep sitting in her favorite chair. My grandfather unfortunately had to find her the next morning and passed a couple years later from grief. He had ulcers on his stomach
I feel so sorry for those 69 people who gave this video a thumbs down,  I know what it's like to be helpless and all you can do is just watch your loved one slip away slowly , it's gut wrenching
Hey man as a 29 yr old man that is terminally ill and i have had 21 doctors tell me they cant figure it out. I have to sit everyday and watch my children wat h me die and its very sad but i could never afford the treatments i cant even work due to my health and get the basic things they need. Its inspiring to see someone speak of our strength. Would love to meet you before i die if i get that chance and the money ima make it happen.
Thank you making this song, it means a lot. I just recently lost my grandfather to cancer.
Thank you again Tom Macdonald your always on point brother, this song is going to get so many people through their rough ass journey having CANCER. You stated at your last "LIVE" this new song is the BEST song that you ever made. You are absolutely Fucking Correct my friend!! #hangovergang4ever #cancersucks #HOG
Protect Tom Macdonald at all costs.  For Real
and that moms diamond wedding ring is big enough to buy a cure for cancer
Good song people need this to listen to a lot of people have cancer they need something to keep there head up 💯🔥
Who the hell would diss like this video
Did it again brother you did it again! Keep em coming!
Thank you for this song my uncle died from cancer a couple weeks ago
Fire 🔥 video bro keep up this shit bro one of the only speaking on all the stuff that they trying to hide from us🙏👍
Song makes me cry
Absolutely love your music
Oh man this is so good. Maybe even better than People So Stupid.  Thank you for this Tom 🖤. My aunt fought mesothelioma for ten years and beat it. I cant wait to show this to her
i think they do have a cure but they are withholding the cure because they make alot of money off the sick people
O and I shared the shit outta this song, I put it on every platform I have  much love 💘 xoxo damn it  still crying... curse you Tom Macdonald
Love this ... amazing 😊
All truth!!  I still got goosebumps. Keep on doing what you do Tom and Nova😭😭🤧💖💖💜💜
Im going through Treatment now for Refratory Hodgkins Lymphoma.  My odds are not good. At most a survival rate of 30 percent for next 5 years. Thanks for this! Such truth. The feelings, fear and anger at the bullshit cancer industry!!
Thank you for this ... underneath the sad truth there is a inspiring anthem... Prayers and love for anyone fighting the fight and for those who love them 🙏❤️
I normally don't comment on videos even if I'm a fan or like it, but this hit me so hard cuz I'm a cancer survivor,  non Hutchins lymphoma,  lots of chemo and radiation, that my treatment almost killed me I'm 6' I dropped to 115lbs but I some how beat in so Tom thank you for this
My Mom and my Mother in law both said Fuck Cancer and are Both some of the strongest people I've ever known in my life. Never give up, Always keep fighting. Thank you Tom, This is the message that needs to be spread, with enough positivity the world can extinguish the pain and suffering. G.O.A.T Tom Macdonald!!
This hits home. My grandfather died after being diagnosed with cancer. The sucky part is the cancer itself didn’t take him. It was the chemo and radiation... thanks for the anthem that shows that this one thing is so devastating. HOG!!!
Wow
Got me crying bro
I'm not crying! You're crying.  Awesome video.
Well that was sad.....
Love this #fuckcancer.💯
Thank you straight up and right on
Thank you for this Tom so true. I refuse to go through chemo or radiation. I will just live the best life God blesses me with until He calls me Home.  Not going to lie this song made me cry 😢 love you Tom
My love to everyone who has been affected, I know how fucking bad it is, so my love to everyone watching this video
Thank you for being awesome.  God bless you.
Fuck Yes.
Wow amazing touched  by god
Damn man...that song hits you in the heart....
I lost my Mother in April, and my Father in May of this year, both due to cancer.. i live in another state and because of covid19, I wasnt able to be there for their last moments, or funerals except via video call, and its a reality i still haven't came to terms with or accepted... this song hurts, but in a good way, thank you for your voice on yelling the obvious and pointing out the corruption in our systems  ♡
Thank youu Tom I needed this I’ve been goin through a tough time recently with my aunt getting lung cancer keep up the great music Tom you’ve found a fan forever in me.
So there's rappers who cares not only for themselvs huh
This was totally true! Thank you!
Dam thats deep
Beautiful❤
❤️🙏
Lost my dad to Cancer
Great song...love your music
this is very very touching amazing song Tom #fightcancer
👏👏👏
It's been 5 months now. It still hurts.😢
I cried :'(
We luv u an  all the great work u put into ur art of music .
The cure is your immune system. Being healthy is the treatment. The body heals itself. 7-9 hours of sleep aligned with  circadiam rhythems, organic whole food nutrients, positive thoughts and emotions, positive relationships, movement/exercise, spirituality.
Wow man, I'm blown away!!! Great song and excellent video!!! 🤘
Thats hits home great job
Thank you
I thought this one was gonna be about tic tok... cancer
Sensitive topic well executed man. Keep at it
Wow
Words can not describe the way you put shit down. Make people think, call put bullshit. Keep these messages coming. Instead of worrying what others want to here. Your giving shit we need to hear!!!
Bro tom this brought tears to my eyes. My mother in law in going through her chemo and radiation now for cancer near her lungs. This is such a strong song dude. Your an amazing artist and person much love bruh!!! #HANGOVERGANGFOREVER!
god bless you my man! this hit home to so many! keep up the good work!
Wow amazing
#masksoff they are lying to everyone to keep billions into medical
Thank you for this 🤘🏻❤
Those who disliked this song went underground...What you actually want...Haters  This song is incredible 🤗🤗🤗 thanks a lot for making this...it's really GOD GIFTED for me..May those who are suffering from cancer get better very soon by the grace of Allah..Love you all💯😍😍😍😍
I absolutely love this song & video!
This is a beautiful song and hope it helps whoever needs it
My grandpa was diagnosed with cancer in 2018 thank the Lord it came back clear and he has had a heart transplant and almost died then when I was little and I’m 12 and he has a cancer for about a year and then it came back clear so thank you for this
I thank you for such a beautiful song. I'm battling sclc. I know the battle ahead is a uphill one but I'm never to give up. Again, thank you for this song. You keep it real and this is why I love everything you do. Keep it this way
Dam bro......I started tearing up. My dad died 2 months after this shit started. He had cancer and MD Anderson wanted to give him full brain radiation. 10 days straight. After the 5th day they sent him home because he couldn't walk couldn't talk. It hurt to see him like that. I went to visit him at his home and 2 hrs later he passed. I didn't get to know him very well..I miss him.
I love this. My father struggles with cancer and he has to work his life away to afford the treatments. Its tough but all we can do is stay strong
100 % if only we can make our leaders pay for treatments  and research as everything IS carcinogenic, from industrial toxic environment.. people don't get to chose what life they live, everything is owned by someone, from the company you work for to the land you live on, its about time we unite and dominate. Why should you have to pay for your right to live within this environment that has been made around you?  Maybe then the treatments won't cost as much and they might be forced into a solution if the cost is large.  I appreciate the efforts in this, I have done a lot for charity to give children with cancer a chance to do something before they die. I dont want likes or recognition, its about the people and families of those that need help. Pains me to even think about those people now with this virus around us to know there is little one can do that can give them a little bit of sunshine in their life. To all that have lost be strong, give support to those who are dealing with the same trauma you went through ... they need you. Peace love and light
I'm crying! That was beautiful
My uncle was diagnosed with stage 4 recently.... fucking hell tom why now ;-;
Sad that's true but we all do know someone 😢2:00-2:05 Best advice brother now let a fan tell you Tom you gone be singing with the angels cause this is just the beginning.
Tom, you a real one.
Omg Tom keep bringing us the truth. Thank you. Best wishes to you and yours.
"You won't know know how to be brave  til you choose to fight when you're afraid.   And you can't experience strength  til you've struggled to carry the wait. And you won't know why you have faith  til you look the devil in his face. And you don't know what you can take  til you realize you didn't break."  Wow... if this ain't the truth I don't know what is.  Amazing lyrics, thank you Tom!  My mother lost her fight with cancer almost a year ago.  I was never more proud of her than when I saw the courage, strength, and faith she showed while gracefully battling this awful disease.  Thanks for sharing such a beautiful message.  Nothing but love for you and Nova!
You’re an inspiration Tom!!! I truly love everything you do!! You have no idea what you music means to me, I don’t know where I’d be without it!
I wish youtube showed the people who disliked videos like FB does.
Amazing. ❤️  The world needed this song. Thank you.
I'm not crying, you are! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Awesome song thank you
not the hero we wanted....but the hero we need . this is gonna make so many ppl stronger the bridge lyrics were so real
Lost my dad in 1983 to lung cancer, I was 8. I live a lot of your songs, but this one will be special to me. Thank you.
Wow. I hope this song goes viral. 🤯
Love this song have a long time friend just finished her treatments for breast cancer this song brings out the feels for sure
Wow excellent song
my dream is to meet and to take a selfie with you,you such an amazing person who always cheers me up through music may God bless you my dear
Iv been saying this for years, that they probably have a cure but don't want to save people bcuz they make way to much money from it....& I'm 46 now and have 7 grandkids and to know if one of them get cancer at a young age, they wld let them die... it's fucked up, that IF they do have a cure & they let kids & other folks die from it jus to fill the pockets of scum that's behind it.. may y'all burn in hell....
Wow. Your awesome bubba.
Fantastic !  Jesus is coming to wipe every tear!  Buckle down Saints! Gird thy loins   And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.  We will be overcome we still gotta try!  but Jesus is the victory!  Thanks Tom great song!
Well done, Tom. I am a fighter and survivor of breast cancer and this song and video really touched me. I will be sharing it on my Breast Cancer forum website. God Bless.
👏👏👏👏👏
Sad
Stop hating he is saying a good message
I think it's something like 7/10 women get breast cancer and 8/10 men get prostate cancer or something along those lines  Edit: Sounds like a lot but I swear that’s what I remember lol
@Tom MacDonald -  Get yourself off of youtube, and onto bitchute and other platforms that won't censor you.  They might not get you today, but people are dropping like flies here!
Wow!! Four of my family members have had cancer, 2 have made it and 2 passed. Thanks for making this song!!
Love it, man. My baby nephew just won the fight with brain cancer. He was extremely strong. A true life super hero. Thank you!
“We’ve been paying them to kill ourselves. We’re dying to keep living”   Very deep song man. Beautiful words. This song will touch a lot of people. I admire the diversity in your music. Definitely shows your talent 🙏🏻
This hits home.   My father passed in July 2018 at 62 years young.  I still am not over it.   Just seeing my kids grow up without their grandfather just doesn’t sit with me.  All the doctors and everything he went through the ups and downs of this disease was horrible to watch.  He is in a better place now.  But I wish he was still here with us.
Love this song. I've been fighting cancer for 5 years now, I was diagnosed when I was 29. I refuse to let it control me.
Very powerful song, Well done👍
Vote TRUMP IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE LIKE TOM!
there isnt a cure for cancer  bc its different and unique to the individual. also, how is a cure for skin cancer going to cure a blood cancer? if there was a cure all, it would for sale.
Damn Damn Damn!!!!! My heart is literally hurting right now, what's unbelievably crazy is that when my mom found out she had ovarian cancer my oldest son took my idea and got fight tattooed on his forearm...dude it's too hard to try and type with tears and blurred eyes, thank God for auto correct!!!! Or this whole thing would have made absolutely no sense at all.. but you f#$$÷! Nailed it yet again, WATCH OUT HE'S ON FIRE 🔥 ...💜
Yes tom this is why your on of the best
Bro your so fucking good at what you do. I fucking love you brother!!!!!! I'm literally in tears listening right now!!

To someone who has fought Leukemia as a baby and won this hits hard
Yes tom this is why your on of the best
Both my grandma an grandpa had to use chemo. So this hits home hard.. the chills I get from this song reminds me of when I was 5. If you don’t even think of shedding a tear during this you got a strong heart. Bless you all❤️
Yes it is wild my family had no one passed from cancer my dad who didn't get drafted went and joined the Marines during the Vietnam war went and fought for our country came home had me and my sister and PTSD he had three purple hearts and 12 years ago cancer took him this was a man who know nothing but fight now my moms brother is fighting the same fight I am 50 and have no insurance or a way to even get checked believe after seeing how terrible this disease is I don't want to know I do believe they have a cure but the Cure would crush the economy we're worth less than a dollar think about it people
FREAKING NAILED IT AGAIN MY BROTHER!! Great message in this song just like always. Keep up Tom!
I lost my grandmother to cancer a long back. She was such a strong lady and she faught till the end. This really reminded me of her. Thank you
LOVE THIS!!  As always you say things that need to be said.  I think my wife has a theme song for the next year.  We are currently 3 months into a full year of chemo treatments, then possible surgery.  She is a fighter!
Thanks for serving humanity. So tired of the garbage music these days. Well done Tom! Keep it up!
Thanks love it
This hit close to home.  My wife had cancer but thank God she is now cancer free
Hits really close to home lost my dad to cancer on December 22 2017 miss him so much
I cried .. because so many have left us to soon for no reason . There is a cure for cancer . When my , ok let me start from the begining. I've lost 3 family members to cancer . My Sister Kim , My Mother Debbie , and My Uncle Jerry. When I found out my sister had cancer , I googled cure your own cancer. When I did I was overwhelmed by information on cannabis oil curing cancer . Now how do u get anyone to listen to that if it's Listed as a schedule 1 drug and said to have no medicinal properties .. this world is so backwards. For me to speak on everything would take a series of books . We need to do something about this. Somehow cheers
Wow. This is incredible
Dude, you bring tears to my eyes!!!!!!!!!! I had a HUGE brain tumour. I made it and now I build houses so family's can have a home. Love you man. So fucking much.
God this is absolutely soul touching, incredible job Tom. Beautiful song with a beautifully put message.
90 billion in donations is exactly why they haven't cured it. They need a replacement before they'll cure it. They'll never give up that cash cow till they have a new epidemic to continue to finance their livelyhoods.  I've had cancer twice, once at 25 and again at 30 so I think I'm entitled to my thoughts even if they seem a bit conspiracy theory-ish
Love that you made this man, I lost my great grandmother to cancer 3 weeks ago, this was her 4th cancer battle, she was a strong woman who lived a good 83 years
That reminded me the first time I cut all my hair off this is good
Tom MacDonald hits it hard again. Nothing but respect and love for you and the messages you deliver.
Miss you Mommy. You're still my guiding light. Thank you Tom. Lots of love to you and yours.
That's the thing tho their is a cure for cancer weed is proven to shrink cancer cells but what does the government do? Make it illegal. Instead of funding science to make a cure from It instead they fund police and military instead of education, youth services mental health services the system doesn't care about the people
Yessir if only music could cure it this would be the remedy Tom saddest thing is you even had to make a song about it. Hope for a better tomorrow
great song  I made sure I shared it on facebook
Absolutely beautiful! My husband and my family both have had to watch so many of our loved ones wither away due to this awful disease, brought tears to my eyes. Absolutely beautiful!
Amazing bro this song is so meaningful
Thanks man this hits hard. My dad is currently battling stage 4 pancreatic cancer its been a year since his diagnosis.
Why would anyone not love this message your sending out? Why because it’s not your normal hits? This message is amazing thank you so much for this! I hope this helps the many struggling with wether the fight is worth it or not! YOU ARE WORTH IT!
Man took the words out of many of our mouths, it makes you happy to know your not the only one who sees the world this way. You are amazing Tom, keep doing what you doing.
This song is absolute fire, most likely my new favorite song, Love you Dude
Just wow, go tom. Always a meaning that everyone can get behind, go man go.
All I can say is 😭😭😭😭😭 but to those who are fighting u shall win
Lost my Dad 12/20/09 to Cancer. I remember  picking him up when he fell out of the shower and other times.. Cancer is nasty, it takes its toll on EVERYONE while the Tabaco, Alcohol and Chemical companies continue raping their victims. Taking their victims money and esteem. I wish every day my Father was still here. I am 50 and miss the hell out of him. R.I.P. Dad, Love you
I'm a cancer survivor this hits home this is good
You're amazing, Tom. Keep it up, brother.
Truth be spoken
Thank you bro. My mom has cancer. I cry every time I play this song. I can't wait to listen to it with her
You're of a different breed Tom MacDonald. Very cool.
Thanks Tom the song had me and some tears the truth and it's very very sad thing to watch somebody go through it and suffer. Much love
Why the fuck would people down vote such a deep meaningful song?
Hits deep Tom, a testament to your writing ability. Brought a tear to my eye thinking about my cousin who was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago. She is still fighting and kicking cancers ass 💪. Beautiful work Tom #HOG
My father was diagnosed with stage 4 renal cancer last month it's incurable and this hit home hard! Thanks for keeping it real Tom we need more musicians like you in these dark times. I pray for everyone else who is going through this too. God bless 🙏🙏
Wow
Awesome! Thank you for this!!
I hope #TRUMP2020 wins and maybe he can dig into why theres no cure yet! Definitely has something to do with big pharma and politicians because with a cure they couldn't line all their pockets with money off the drugs they sell to keep you alive just a little bit longer!
WOW Tom this is deep!
Good song, my wife lost her mom to cancer years ago so this hits deep but in a good way
Cancer is an industry in itsself
Damn, man.
*Get your here before 1 hour ticket*
6 ppl came here just to hate..
Love this bro!!!  ❤️😭❤️
Omg dude.... My heart. You hit the soul everytime with that powerful s*** dude. Everytime.
Wow, 😭😭😭😭😭Best song yet. Love you Tom💞💞💞💞
My brother in law was just diagnosed with brain cancer and I wanted to send him this song when I got the Gravestones album. It would be cool if you sent it Tom. I can give u his Email address. Please let me know if you would be willing to do that.
This hits home have had few family members pass away from cancer and my fiance dad passed in 2014 it's a horrible thing to go thru u just wanna take away their pain and make them better! Thank you Tom for making this vid!
THANK YOU BROTHA!! 🔥🔥💯💯❤️❤️ REALLY NEEDED THIS
Another awesome song❤️🙏🏻❤️. I'm sure you reached a lot of people's hearts and also giving a lot of people more hope with this song♥️.
For the few people who see this, you probably know someone whose loved ones are sick, the medicine for dogs' heartworm if someone who has cancer eats the heartworm medication, it eats cancer cells  I lost my grandmother in third grade for almost six years and she  refused to take the opportunity to continue living. I remember that her last 3 days we had to force her to eat and drink water.   So please if you're reading this please spend time with your loved ones and cherish every moment you can with them because you never know when your next conversation will be ❤❤❤  Please like so someone who needs it can see this and I give anyone to copy and paste this anywhere ❤❤❤
Love it! 💙 💙
Thank you tom. Your a boss dont forget.
Claim u here before milliln vews "tickets here"
I lost my Dad 7 yrs ago. He was given 6 months to live with treatment.The cancer treatment radiation killed him, not the cancer. Miss you Pops. Stay strong everyone!

I am going through chemotherapy now, because of this evil disease. Third year in a row. Getting a bone marrow transplant next month. I can't wait for it all to be over with. It's a really hard journey. Thanks for this, Tom.
imagine unironically listening to this guy
Amazing as always Tom
I never imagined Tom McDonald would make me cry but, he accomplished it!! I lost 2 of the most incredible men in my life to that nasty disease and I am watching one of my bestest friends fight it while the poison is killing her body. Hope is all you have in those times and you try to keep faith but, we are only human. Much love to you Tom!!
THERE IS A CURE FOR CANCER! There’s a story that has been passed down in my family. My family has lived in Mexico for generations and generations. There was a man in the town who claimed to have a cure for cancer. And he went around giving it to people who were sick. Eventually the U.S. government heard about this and wanted to know if it was true. And it was. BUT. It was an all natural remedy. Meaning anyone could make it. They destroyed the formula and insisted on moving forward until they found a cure that could only be made in a lab. (Do they could make money). The man was told to be silent. He only told a hand full of people what happened. But the cure existed. The government hides everything.
Damn Tom, that messed me up a little. Thanks for this!
As a survivor of stage 3 colon cancer that had 84 tumors removed thru my entire body from my throat to my intestines I approve this 100 percent lost my grandfather to 3 types of cancer #cancersucks
Thank you for this. 3 years ago I lost my step dad and watch him fight everyday. Now my Father has pancreatic cancer.... thank you for this tom.  #hangovergang
This one hit different. I love it. Thank you we need this. I’ve lost a ton of fighters to cancer. Love you!!
Just speechless... Definitely need tissues and a hug😭. Don't give up people, Keep fighting.🙏💫
Such a heartfelt song filled with a very beautiful message..
I shared this on Facebook and Twitter, then I dm'ed it to a few people I know struggling with cancer right now.
Tom always making music that matters, thank you bro
Lost my mom to cancer so yeah this song hits hard 💔
Thank you Brother. Just lost my Mom in June to cancer, so this hit home with me.
😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪Song hits home hard.....I shared my bedroom with my Grandpa for almost 3yrs before he lost his life to Cancer...Dr. said he had less than 6mths when he denied chemo and said when the GOOD LORD is ready I'll be ready. He lasted almost 3yrs without Chemo.....
Hard hitting words 💔 its an industry built on pain and suffering.
Pretty sure everyone can relate to this some how. Fuck Cancer. Powerful shit Tom
GD. Just when you thought Tom had a lane, he goes totally off the track. Absolutely amazing Tom and Nova. You keep rewriting the script of what it means to be an artist. Thank you for keeping yourself independent so you can be you.
Every song is better than the last. You are a beacon of light in a world of dark. HOG FOREVER
I lost my uncle this weak to cancer, my mother's last remaining sibling. The man was a hero in more ways than one: he survived abuse and defended his younger sisters (my aunts) from their perverted stepfather when he was barely 12 years old; often getting severely beaten when he stood in the way,  he joined the army and served his country well, he helped jump-start a hospital in his hometown by acting as the COO, and he built an wonderful life for his family. He died surrounded by his wife,  children, and grandchildren with no regrets. "You won't know why you have faith, until you the look the Devil in his face" describes him well, as he was devoutly Catholic, and feared neither death nor pain. Thank you, Tom, for making this song.
I wish I felt this way.
Keep speaking the truth
Did Nova get a cinema camera? The tones and dynamic range are so good.  Keep it up #HOG
Omg man that shit heavy,  Straight fire again So true
When you said we'll cry when we hear this song I was 50/50 on if it would... but damn Tom im at work on a break and this song choked me up and brought tears to my eyes thinking of my dad, who passed from cancer
I lost my causin to cacer he was like a second dad he was funny and kind of an ass but i but love him anyway i wish i could go to heaven for a day and see him but any way thanks tom McDonald for making your music i can relate to.
God dam my dad just got the all clear. With his cancer. But with his age It could come back.
You are one hell of a inspirational artist! just speaking the truth!!   Keep doing you
Me: Sweet! Tom got a new video. I'll listen to it while I get ready for work.  10 minutes later, my eyes are cheeks are drenched in tears, and I can't get any make up on.  Thanks Tom! 😭 (JK)  I lost my dad to cancer 7 years ago. Sh*t ain't pretty. My dad was my hero.  Grateful for the time we had together, and I know he's at peace now. He was a God fearing man, and the most selfless person I've ever met.
Thank you Tom means so much I lost my nana 5 yesrs ago feels just yesterday loosing her to stage 4 lung cancer. My mother has rectal cancer and my mother in law has breast cancer. You speak the truth words of wisdom. Love to both you and Nova
What a good song bro i lost my aunt to cancer 8 years ago an i still miss her so thanks for puttin this song an i dont care who dislikes my comment but dude it really made me cry an i felt like i needed this song to help wit this the way im feelin fuck cancer
How could anyone dislike this?
Tom....hit home for real!!! My Dad who means everything to me has been struggling through this fucked up battle with cancer. Little back story, this man met my mom when I was 2 years old, married her when I was 6. No I'm not his biological daughter but he always treated me like his own. He adopted me when I was 8, gave me his last name, put his name on my birth certificate and made his daughter!! I was so proud and still am today! He was my saving grace, gods knows where I'd be today if he hadn't walked into my life. In 2018 he diagnosed with lung cancer....aggressive chemo and he was in remission in 9 months. But cancer wasn't done yet....3 months later they found a golf ball size tumor in the back of is brain. A year of radiation, more chemo and surgery to remove the tumor and we thought he was on the road to recovery. Nope....in August they found a few pea size tumors in his brain. He has been in aggressive treatment since September. This type of chemo effects everything. He can barely walk let alone stand, partial blindness (can't even read a text message), just mentally not there. Worst part....he lives in Texas me and the rest of the fam live in Pennsylvania. This man saved me and took care of me and all I want is to do the same for him. I have to be the strong one....my little brother (my Dad's biological son) is not emotionally capable of handling this. Of course they are blood so I'm not supposed to be effected like he is.....I'm a fucking mess but I hide it well. Sorry guess not the place to spew my shit but your lyrics hit me hard. Thank you!!! H.O.G 4-EVER
So hard trying not to cry and feel sad over something like this 😞
Got me crying man. Thank you for this song, I  lost my mom to cancer 6 years ago.
Get this to 10 million views sharing is caring. You can share to you facebook news feed aswell.. let's show tom some love!!!
thanks Tom.. after losing my mother 1 year ago this song pulls on so many strings and brings back alot of heavy feelings, in a good way. thanks for the music and keep up the great work
My aunt and mother in law battled breast cancer at about the same time. One of the scariest times of my life. To stay strong while with them was tough and I can only imagine what they were going through but I am blessed to say that they both beat it. To those fighting the good fight, you are stronger than you know. NEVER lose hope and NEVER give up! Thank you Tom for another incredible song.
🙏🙏🙏
I've had several family members pass due to cancer.  This song hits home hard for me.  Thank you for bringing up the awareness to such a horrible disease.
I was literally taking  break from reading and researching every link, blog, advice column and what have you in an effort to find some inkling of hope and info on coping with long term  grief . My children and I lost our super hero 3 years ago to cancer and the pain seems to grow new strength  no matter how much time passes.  And so many very possible, some proven real cures exist. Yet, we are led to believe they are dangerous or nonsense. Sadly, when your life is on the line it is hard to leap into the unknown and turn away from the spoonfed familiar professional advice of your doctor. Even when you know in your heart he is a slave to the medical industry himself, closely monitored by the Evils that be
love the song Tom lost my mom because of Johnson's baby powder ovarian cancer  3 years ago she was 65  Those people that don't like this song have no heart . they obviously lost no one to cancer. they wasted their breath  of life to tell you that they didn't like the song with a thumbs down truely( F) those people
All I can say is bruh... You legit just hit bullseye in my feelers. Having my father, who fought and beat cancer, I know this one. Thank you for this. It will help many.
I have been living with stage 4 Colorectal Cancer since 2018. I had 28 radiation treatments and 19 rounds of chemo. Best decision I ever made was firing all my Doctors. I'm still alive and thriving!
You weren't kidding about the 😭😭😭😭 My family is riddled with various forms. Thank you......just Thank you
My thoughts and prayers out to anyone fighting or losing loved ones from cancer 🙏🙏♥️ I have loved ones and friends who have won the battle and some who have lost the battle it sucks 😥 I try to help by donating my hair to locks of love for people who need it my last donation I sent 30+ inches of my hair cause it's the only way I could help others I wish I could do more I have family and friends who are still fighting the battle this song was amazing ❤️❤️ you and Nova are beautiful people you did a great job with this song and video ♥️ you never disappoint us with the hard work you put into your music and videos stay safe and much love to you both♥️
The government doesn't care... It's all about the money.
THIS SOME REAL SHIT! NOT CACA!  😷🇲🇽👍💪👏 LIFE IS A MYSTERY .BUT IT IS  BEUTIFUL. THROUGH PAIN AND LOVE. 🙏
I lost my son 5 years ago. He was diagnosed at 10. He lived to be 28. He was a fighter!  This one had me reliving those dark days. My prayers for all fighting this battle and those fighting with you 💔
Amazing song, I love it! U speak the truth in all ur songs! Thank u for the awesome work u do!!!!
✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻😢😢😢😢🎇🎆 my grandma passed away from cancer not so long ago
I have a brain tumor that they are waiting to remove because my insurance won't cover the operation until it's got me on my death bed. In the meantime, I could lose my vision any second and suffer severe headaches every day. We only found it because of the headaches I was having. I have spent thousands on doctors and tests and I truly feel that they just want to drag it out to wring more money from me. Family and friends don't understand the struggle because all we see on tv is people having things removed or immediately treated. That isn't always reality. Reality is "wait and see," and oh, call an ambulance if you suddenly go blind.
60 dislikes? Are you kidding me?
Amazing song bro! 💯
My dad passed 10 year's ago from tyroid cancer, love the song Tom
I come from China, I love you music！
Tom, you and Nova are Brilliant, you hit the hard topics and make make everyone aware of them, keep up your good work you make a great team, and this is a great message. Thank you.
Tom you have outdone yourself again my guy.  Keep making great music that touches people's lives.  Stay blessed my brother.  P s nova killing the video making game
Awesome video bro! Awesome! Never give up! God is there for us all. Sick or healthy Hes always waiting for you!
song hits close to home, lost many people to cancer past 3 years. keep up the good music!
My Dad's chemo treatment failed and was terminal. He took his ass to Mexico and found a treatment and lifestyle that defeated his lymphoma.....  The Hoxey treatment .... share this with someone who thinks all hope is lost.... they saved my dad's life... but it was thru diet and life choices with assistance of a tonic..... they have to want to be saved  and follow the plan or it won't work... I hope this finds someone who needs it
These videos are why I love toms music it's all true and heartfelt in some way other then drugs booty's and mumbles
I love you man
This is so amazing, powerful song
And this is why I am a fan Quality work
I lost two good friends from cancer 2 years ago Cancer suck. Thank you for this wonderful song Tom Macdonald ❤
My toenails just sliced open my leg I’m in immense pain all I wish for is the sweet release of breath no more.
My great grandmother died of cancer she fought her ass off and went in to remission just for it to come back. She said she was tired and just wanted to rest the next day she passed away.
Thank you for this sir. My mother passed of cancer in 2011. Drs never caught it. When they finally found it she was already in stage 4.
This song brought me to tears. You are an amazing soul, and I'm so thankful for the beauty you put into this world. KEEP UP THE GOOD FIGHT SIR!!!
Art bro

Omg love this song. You guys rock!! I gotta admit...I teared up a bit.
I absolutely can't wrap my head around the fact the people are disliking this......WTF!!! As usual an absolutely amazing song from Tom meant to give hope and tell people they aren't alone and people fucking dislike it. Keep coming with it Tom the true fans will be here and you're fan base is steady growing. HOG for life!!!!
I love you for making this Tom‼️❤️  My mom, she passed at the age of 34 due to cancer. I turned 14 yrs old on Dec 6th 2007 and she passed away Dec 14th 2007.   I just wanted to say thank you and I love you're music. I need you to continue! ❤️
Love it 9/10 beautiful song and wonderful message. Shared to FB. I'm in the hospital now. Nothing serious. But I have turned on 4 diffrent people to your music. Doing my part for the HOG army. Thank you for your hard work and commitment. Shout out Nova for another killer video. Love y'all be safe.
Lost my father 9 years ago to a 4 year battle with Bladder Cancer and my uncle was diagnosed less than a year after. This hits deep.  Thank you for your voice Tom. Ironically, that was my dad's name too.   Thank you, genuinely.
🖤🖤🖤🖤
Video has been posted for 40 minutes. 45 thousand views. Over 2 thousand comments. Over 10 thousand thumbs up. 60 idiots thumbs down but still came to see the show lol
I encourage anyone who gets cancer to look at alternative doctors as an opportunity, my mother decided not to do chemo and use an alternative doctor instead and she's at below 3% cancer cells.  (From 7%)
Brought tears brother, no joke.... Reminds me of the words I spoke to my daughter in the hospital a few years ago. She's a fighter! ❤️✌️
🔥🔥🔥🔥
WHEW! 3 year survivor here too! Change everything you have been doing. CUT OUT SUGAR and all PROCESSED FOODS, just to start!
I just forwarded this to ALL  my friends on Facebook. Pretty powerful especially in the times we are living in
My cousin got diagnosed w leukemia the day of his 19th birthday he spent 6 month in the hospital an was pumped e chemo almost died twice bc he got an infection an then got a fever of 104.3 they had to put ice all on him an then put him in an ice bath its was scary...one bag of his chemo cost 10k..his parents have great health insurance an it still cost them over 2.1 million dollars for his 6 month stay in the hospital but happy to report it's been 2 yrs he just celebrated his 21st birthday an hes in remission,thank God an modern medicine
My son just had his last chemo treatment yesterday. He has won this round .   Just buried one of my best friends from cancer 4 days ago .  This song is awesome thank you .
Lost my favorite grandpa to cancer, my favorite teacher growing up, on of my good friends is fighting cancer right now and less then 2 weeks ago lost a friend who had been fighting for 30 years. Song hits home bro
Definitely cried. 🥺 I miss my grandfather so much.  Good job Tom this was a really good one 🔥
Thanks for doing this song it's been on constant rotation since I got the new album this has been a struggle in my life with no outlet my wife diagnosed lost several members of my family to it one of my better friends
I like all your stuff Tom but this hit me on a whole new level. Thank you for your work. I've only dealt with a small thing of skin cancer that was caught way early on and haven't had a lick of it since, but I feel blessed that I'm alive today to hear the music you make. And I sympathize and empathize with all the people that have to deal with that terrible illness.  Thank you again.
Powerful bro. My grandma battled with cancer. My step dad is fighting it. My girlfriends dad is also fighting it as well. Keep speaking the truth. Eventually people will wake up to what's really going on.
This is deep man and it couldn't come at a better time. A friend whom I consider a brother found out Wednesday night his father has stage 4 lung cancer. It's crazy that this is the song released today. Thanks Tom, keep doing what you're doing. It's working.
Everybody can relate to this song so everybody should hear it and share the hell out of it
Bless you Tom.  Thank you for continuing to sing anthems of our lifetimes.
Just found out Monday my son has terminal brain cancer this song is so true but so hard to listen to
I have cancer and it true does suck I don’t know if I’ll see tomorrow but this blood cancer sucks I am only 17 and don’t want to die. Thanks Tom for making this love you budda
Very good job tom. My wife's dad died 5 years ago from cancer and this touched her heart. She started crying mid video. She says she loves it.
I've lost a good friend n several family members to cancer. Thank you. I can't believe 60 people disliked this.
Miss you pops,itsbeen 3 long years with out you, shits not getting easier without you. Me and the boys miss you,your my hero
damn good song Tom! Grandfather died from it a few years ago i think it was skin or colon cancer. Father had kidney cancer but the doctors cought it in time and removed.
This hits home an makes me cry my mom just died a month ago from cancer she was one hell of a fighter the doctors lie an give false home I miss her every day thank you Tom for making this an this is why I love your music cause you speak truth an facts an it raw an amazing. Nova did her thang as always .
Kemo = billions a year ... cancer will never be cured, and it's victims will forever stay a source of income
You have such a gift of clarity on how you deliver the facts and help more people understand that as $hitty as this subject is we have given so much and if we as people do a little digging find out that all the money and research there is a majority of the results that can't be duplicated. Which means they are just feeding us numbers and banking those dollars. Which are being run by phrama...
Amazing song Tom. I was looking forward to it all week and you never disappoint! So talented man. You and your girl
Tom... If your reading this, thank you.
This particular song here it's pretty close to my heart and I'm pretty sure it hits close to a couple of my cousin's hearts too considering we just lost my aunt like 2-3 years ago the breast cancer I thank you for the song man it really means a lot thank you Tom
Didn't show up in my notification box... supposed to get all notifications from you...
Thank you!! We need this!! Powerful words
I’m quitting cigarettes right now. Anyone else who is with me hit the button and comment below. We can do this
There is a cure out there but the government doesn’t want to release it because they will loose money!!!
"We are Paying them to kill ourselves, we are dying to keep living". Damn thats facts right there.
Tom Mac out here getting me chocked up when I thought he was going to drop something controversial. Still dropping that truth no matter what the content is!
Remember doctors PRACTICE medicine......NO MONEY IN A CURED PATIENT...They developed a MOUTHWASH 10 years ago that stopped All tooth decay with just two applications......It was DEEP SIXED and never heard from again
Here's to another awesome song! Keep up the good work! Love it!
I don't have cancer, I have diabetes, but ever since I was diagnosed with diabetes, I basically gave up on loving myself because I had a broken body. I can't imagine the pain and loss you feel when you have cancer, because I know cancer is much, much worse. With diabetes I can live, I can survive, but with cancer you won't know what day is going to be last, but even when I look at research and progress for my disease,  I get depressed because while my disease is much less critical, even this lesser disease has made no progress to a cure, just a treatment, and that's all the medical industry cares about, they care about money, not people.
So rad to here you use your voice for a purpose! You are a true inspiration! You are a gift to this generation and for all that you have given us, I thank you!
Thank you for this song I lost my baby girl this year. July week before her 3 birthday . Her name was Ashley . Love u music
This brought me to tears! Thank you Tom! Awesome song
There will never be a cure w/ big pharmaceutical companies in the picture...
I lost my Grandma, Grandfather, and Dad to cancer. This song hits deep. Thank you Tom.

This is truly a tear jerker. A truly amazing work, Tom and Nova.
100% truth
Tears man. Keep the love up and everyone will tear up.
I have lost 3 family members to cancer.
Beautiful piece of art, loved it on your album and love the video
Not all rappers are all about woman and money. Glad I got a rapper to listen to.
Not even laydbak can hate on this chorus.  Thank you for this, Tom.  Sincerely,  a cancer survivor. 12 years cancer free.
Just when you think you can not spit anymore truth! There it is! Thank you for being so real and telling the truth 💚💚
Cried watching this being a cancer survivor along with my mom & brother..... lost my grandfather, grandmother and many other family members because cancer .... thanks Tom
Amazing Tom!!! Thank you so much!
The cure for cancer has been out for decades now. But big pharma will never allow it.   There's also natural ways to cure cancer, AIDS, hepatitis, diabetes, and other diseases. Look into Dr Sebi, who was murdered, and also  Nipsey Hussle, who was doing a documentary on Sebis life, was also conveniently murdered before he could finish it.
Epic song. THANK YOU
Fuck bro you said this would make us cry 😢  my mom is fighting breast 🎀 cancer right now... thank for this song! Much love bro!
Yup definitely TEARS fuck man. 🥺🥺🥺💔😭
My experience lost both breast but thanks to GOD it's been 10 yrs she's still here other than what they call kemo brain she's going crazy and now my wife was just diagnosed with it and bad way your music hits real issues thank you for not being scared to tell it like it should be told
Damn Ninjas over here cutting onions in my house. RIP Michael Martin Santo. Love you pops. Fuck cancer. Finger on the pulse Tom. This is why we're here. Don't ever lose that.
Straight truth bro! Must respect Bro. Love from Northwest Missouri!!!
Keep going ,let the time flow ,I believe in you cause you're iron maiden , NEVER GIVE UP
Thank you ur just amazing bro 💥💥💣💣😢😢
My 3 y/o daughter has been fighting brain cancer the last two years. 5 brain surgeries, chemo, stem cells, radiation. Thank you for making this song Tom.
We lost one, a good one. We all miss you every day Joey Caraffa.
In April my grandma died from cancer it’s hard but I keep going
I didn't cry from the song, I cried remembering what my mom went through. I hope she can here this song from wherever she is now.  ❤
Tom you seem like a pretty tubular dude but honestly i bet you mom and pops even cooler. They would have to be. The visuals lived up to the lyrics. Thank you
Love you Tom
Cancer costs too much money to cure, thats why they keep it around
Love it too many suffer at the hands of this not just those who fight it are affected to watch someone suffer thorough it can leave you dead too
Omg im balling. Good shit tom and much love to you and yours! Prayers to all touched by this bastard cancer fuck cancer!
omg.... he wasnt joking.... this did make me cry...
My man !!! 👊💚💚 there you go again .....changing the world  . 👌🔥🔊🔊
Powerful song man I have lost a few loved ones to cancer its a hard thing to deal with for sure
Hell yeah Tom thank you brother brought tears to my eyes I know what it’s like to be a fighter myself thank you again
Tough watch but beautiful. Keeping it real as always.
Great song brother
He cares
Hey there Tom,  I probably one person you wouldn't expect as a fan, but here I am, 58 yrs old, and I thoroughly love the messages your songs have in them.  This song Cancer really hits a soft spot in me, I lost my father 3 yrs ago to lung cancer, and now my mother is suffering from kidney/colon cancer.   We are a religious family, and my mother being 86 yrs old, has refused treatment.  She knows she has lived a good life, and just wants to go home.  It's not easy to watch, but we fully get what she is saying, cause she doesn't want to go through what my dad went through.   Thanks for your music, your messages, you are doing a tremendous job!  You give us little people hope!   Keep going strong!  You've got this bull by the reigns!
Love it! So much passion
Cool, I really wanted to start crying at noon on a Friday.
Two things:   *Why TF does the doctor at beginning (blacl dude from white boy video) have Marker DRAWN ON eye brows??? *Why is makeup SO bad. . at beginning the girls wig and fake bald head is chunky on her forehead. Looks like I did this video
Good timing, just got diagnosed,  today
I've lost a lot of close people to cancer, and I married the strongest woman I know who beat gallbladder cancer 5 years ago (but lives in constant fear of it coming back). Definatly sharing and tagging people with this one.
Thank you bro!!! Not only for making incredible music but also for the messages that you send through everything you produce. Everything you come out with just makes me want to have a heart to heart with you just because you are on some real shit. Keep on keeping on brotha. Thank you again!!!
Thank you!!!! I lost my Wife of Ten years to Cancer. This brought a year to my eyes.
Tom, You Fuckin Rock Dawg.!
Nailed it brother.
This song means so much to me my dad is dieing from cancer so this song is amazing thank you
Don't see the Republican Party throwing the cure out there either..... You forgot to mention the cure for aids.
Thank you family🤕
this hits hard man.....recently We lost my Grandpa, Roy Wayne Eddings. taught my family a lot! taught me a lot.... the whole "Cancer thing" doesnt hit you IMO unless you see it take hold of someone that had so much life.  To those of you who are fighting, ill keep you in my thoughts, to those who have lost someone from this crap, i get it now more than ever. I love you H.O.G.!
Absolutely love your music!
Cure cancer and the world's overpopulation problem will double and we will just kill it off faster.
Thank you for this video! I was waiting all morning for it to drop. I have the new CD's but your videos always add that special touch. I hope this song touches millions like it did me. FUCK CANCER!
Me cousin is going through keemo therapy and he has cancer in his ankle I know this is nothing compared to what others have but he’s a good kid and he has a baseball career ahead of him he’s around 11 to 12 years old and he’s making a slow recovery so thank you for this song Tom means a lot
Thank you Tom. I have no other words but Thank you
Yes sickness is sad but it’s an important part of our evolution. At creation we could have been immortal but if we were immortal would we ever have got out of that volcanic goop? The answer is no if we were immortal then there would have been no reason to evolve and grow into what we are today. Cancer and other sickness force us to fight and to continue to evolve.
The name of the song changed? Odd. But damn this message has made me tear up ever since i first heard it as track 13 on gravestones! "F cancer"
When they discovered 30 years ago that resonant frequencies kill 60% of cancer cells..🤬
My grandfather passed away a few years ago from cancer.. still hits me once in awhile. Amazing song. Thanks Tom ❤️
Omg dude you have no idea. I have lost a bunch of people I was really close to over the last ten years to addiction and cancer. Glad you mentioned both in here.
Man this song actually hit home for me, last year my great grandpa passed away from cancer it spread to his bones and he couldn’t fight no more but he met his goal he wanted to outlive his brothers and he did he made it 4 days past his birthday R.I.P Grandpa I’ll miss you
What a powerful song. Have had so many family members Pass from cancer. My fiance's sister passed from breast cancer cause a Dr told her it was a clogged milk duct & not to worry about it, UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE. They found the cure for Aids, hepatitis, & etc. Joe Biden even said "if you elect him, he'll find the cure for cancer". So if he's not elected, he's not going to go it. So does he know something we don't¿ However, he's been in politics for 47 yrs & he couldn't have done it by now? Another amazing song by Tom & Nova  that speaks the truth. Thank you both. 🙏🇺🇸👍
This is a song that no one will ever forget. Thank you!
Beautiful song, thanks so much Tom. Keep it up, H.O.G. forever 💝
Better than a flow switch!
Hit home-  Hit Hard-  like whoa
Chills! You are a real life inspiration Tom! Thank you!
Thank you.  I dedicated this in memory of my Dad, we lost him February 17th to Cancer. He was a Fighter, Survivor, and now.. My Guardian Angel. Bless y'all ❤️
I hope this helps plenty of people like me I stopped drinking already and stopped smoking
Dont know why people keep hating if you dont like his music click off and live your life dont trying causing problems in others life's probably wont bother any tom fans tho sorry 😂 have a nice day
I love this song. My grandma has had cancer multiple times. This really hits home.
Man too bad you didn't come out with this few months ago uncle just died of cancer. he was actually liking your music I introduced him to your music....😭
Glad this has less dislikes than usual, maybe the haters felt it too
Maad respect Tom from farrockaway so many artists making the same type of music you a real 1 🔥✊🙏
Your best track yet
SO AWESOME
Absolutely love this Tom 🎼🎤
GOSH DAMN! EVERY WORD HE SAID WAS SPOT ON
❤️❤️❤️
Man! Not a dry eye. Incredible message and talent Tom. Full speed ahead!
Hey Tom,  At first... Very nice song, i'm struggling with cancer in family. Thanks for making this ❤️ loving your music and bought all your Albums. Will be there any possibility soon to buy your music online so I can listen to them on Phone? A lot of good songs of you are missing on spotify. "authority problems" as an example. Keep going on. Sending lots of love from Germany. 💯
Beautiful, absolutely beautiful bro. Never thought I'd describe your music using the word beautiful but it was brother.
This song hit very different very strong and put together song thanks Tom
Damn.... I wish my mom could have heard this
Love this!!!!!
This song touches right where it needs to. Tom, you are an amazing artist and your music touches more lives than you know. Keep writing and keep bringing people the strength and motivation they desperately need. I've battle depression my whole life, to the point where i was concerned for my life. And I can honestly say that your music is one thing that helps me every single day. Thank you so much for everything you do. You're fans love and appreciate you <3
Inspirational
Damn, dude. Amazing song.
Read the comments as I was listening to this song it made me cry a little bit hard hitting song
I will go out on a limb and say this song is the best song of our generation!!!!! Much Love HOG FOR LIFE!
You're an absolute legend, man. I think a lot of people need to hear this
Love the song and massive support to anyone who is battling this stupid sickness that we have a cure for but we won't give it to the public cause they making to much money. KEEP UP THE FIGHT WE ALL SUPPORT YOU.🙏
I got goosebumps,  how i needed to hear these words I'm currently fighting breast cancer... I LOVE z song . Keep thriving.
Awww Tom this was vert very sweet!. Really showing all of you through your music. Shout out to Nova. Love y'all both. What y'all do matters!
Lately I wake up in these awful moods being content but not happy and this song helped me realize I need to happy I woke up this morning and live life to the fullest! Thanks Tom and nova!
Of course they have they cure just like they do for HIV but why in the world would they cure if they cure you then that's gonna be your last vist to them but if they treat you well now that's gonna be hundreds of of thousands of dollars per patient they dont care that your gonna die its not about that to them its about how long can they drag it out before you die think about it the FDA is who approved what you can consume every day but yet it's also that same organisation that approves what drugs you can have in while receiving medical care so if big pharma has the FDA in their back pocket they can get the FDA to approve ingredients that will end up causing all sorts of medical issues then big pharma turns around and makes more money than our brains can even begin to comprehend each year off of the treatments of the illness the ingredients that the FDA approved at the end of the day morals have gone out the window to most people and most just want money people no longer care about other people if our medical field was nothing but people with morals compassion and empathy then the cure for all of these "incurable diseases" would be released tomorrow
I love this song and the message it portrays I just can’t listen to it for long man mad respect as always HOG gang forever ✌🏻.
You are something different Tom, wow. Holy crap.
Amazing!! I would like you to look up @team_jocelyn on TikTok!! This song deserves to be heard by her and her family. She’s a little girl with cancer, and just had another surgery and is fighting this very moment.
Great fucking song my guy
Just found out my mom has stage 4 lung cancer its going to crush me when she gone 💔 MY MOMS MY WORLD
You are a whole movement your one in a million this chorus speaks to every single one who's fighting one thing or another, I will forever love you sir your a worthy role model 🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤
Is that D Storm that is the doctor
1 word: inspirational! !
what a beautiful song. true asf tho.
Reading all the comments made me cry. Thank you Tom you're freaking astounding!
Lyrics: [Intro] Everybody knows someone who's sick 40 percent will get cancer, only half's gonna live Your mom and your dad and your sister stand inside a room And someone won't survive it, do you hope it isn't you?  [Verse 1] I swear that cancer has a cure but they're refusin' to make it They done like 40 years of research, 90 billion in donations We've been runnin' for the cure and wearin' ribbons for ages Why are people still goin' through radiation? It's crazy Hundred billion dollar industry, they can't afford to end it And nobody wants to die, our only option is to spend it We'd givе anything to stick around for just another second Give a fortunе to the doctors who promise they can extend it The profits are astronomic, the hospitals and the clinics Are fillin' coffins with dollars, it's awful, let's just admit it We're all human, we'll keep on fightin' 'cause it's how we survive But it's scary 'cause we don't know where we'll go when we die  [Chorus] Don't give up and know you're strong Show them all your fire The days are hard the nights are long But you are a fighter When it's dire you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor when you're tired You hold tighter, you have heart [Verse 2] Nothin' matters if you don't have your health All the money in the world doesn't help The good might go to heaven and the bad might go to hell But no one wants to leave here, you can tell And cancer touches everyone, it's in our genetics And our world's become so toxic, it's all carcinogenic We've polluted the water, the air, the food we're ingestin' It's full of hormones and poison, our population's infected They sell us cigarettes and liquor, built a business on addictions We've been payin' them to kill ourselves, we're dyin' to keep livin' It's the system, it's a prison, we keep tryin' to beat it We get cancer from keepin' all our demons a secret And our insurance don't cover the things we need to defeat it And even if it does we then we might die from the treatment Our best defense is livin' like we do not know what cancer is Fight it if you have it and pray that there's somethin' after this  [Chorus] Don't give up and know you're strong Show them all your fire The days are hard the nights are long But you are a fighter When it's dire you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor when you're tired You hold tighter, you have heart [Bridge] You won't know how to be brave until you chose to fight when you're afraid And you can't experience strength until you've struggled to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith until you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take until you realize you didn't break  [Chorus] Don't give up and know you're strong Show them all your fire The days are hard the nights are long But you are a fighter When it's dire you burn brighter in the dark You're a survivor when you're tired You hold tighter, you have heart ❤️
Best song yet!!! I love this!!!
😭
Thank you for this. My son was diagnosed with cancer at age 9. He's now 13, just getting off treatment and kicked cancers ass! This song really hit my heart and brought the tears. Everything these ppl and their loved ones goes through because of this horrible evil.
Thank you for this one, Tom. I lost my dad years ago to cancer and this really hits home. Yeah it's on the album, but if you ever had a song that needed a video for the masses to hear it, this is it. HOGFOREVER.
He didnt lie when he said we'd cry watching this, I literally love Tom for this. No ads on the vid as well, cheers to this King. #HOG4eva
I've never donated to cancer research bc it's bullshit when they kill people who find cures. Not to mention it's a product of our society, if we didn't live like we do we wouldn't have half of the illnesses that we do! And that info is always being actively suppressed. And don't even get me started on free energy.
F××× cancer! This song with touch so many people. Our family has lost a grandpa and grandmother from cancer and it never gets easier. Much love and support! HOG for life ❤
You always know how to make something powerful...You are A Great Artist...Thank You For Everything
H.O.G
I use to do janitorial in a cancer center, all I saw was upbeat people sitting in a chair getting IV treatment at the same time smiling and getting care from nurses along side family members. The sick are the strongest regardless of the conditions.
How could anyone dislike this song
There is a cure for cancer! FECO oils! I cured my cancer with it. My best friends brother did too. Google Darren Steve Miller from Granite city IL!! He helped Mike Tyson with making his oils. He helped the UK playboy model and virologist, Kerri Parker, cure her brain cancer too!! I'm currently working on a new version of FECO. I have studied cannabis for 24 years. I used to program rocket systems in the Army and now I had to cure myself! The VA ignored me and all of my issues!! They mocked me on record too! I went through he for years! Attempted suicide 6 times too! Spent many weeks in the hospital afterwards. I finally said fuck the VA and put my knowledge to use!! I am going to be showing the world here this next year what my oils can do!!! Follow my channel bro!!  I have commented many times and have yet to get a response. My wife has posted on your Facebook page too. Me as well.  I have cured mine! Others can too!! I lost both of my grandpas from cancer within 3 weeks of each other. I have a personal issue with this crap!! It has ruined my life and many others! Please look me up Tom!!!! I love your material! I used to play music room I've played with many pro bands. This is what I do now! I'm going to help people save themselves! FUCK the Government and doctors that follow the government's stance on cannabis!!!
damn this shit hits home so hard my mom has been fighting cancer and its not looking to good i just pray i get one more christmas with her
Thank you i have listened rwice I'm still crying so much truth
It's sad but true. They try to make us sick so we can pay them to fake fix it but really make you more sick so you have to pay more
Fan or not, how tf does this song have a single dislike? Man
That's Some Quality Music Right There* Great way Of Raising An Awareness.  Thanks Man
This!!! 🔥 ❤️ Be thankful for what you DO have. 😊 😌
Amazing! It has been fascinating & entertaining to watch your music mature in such a short time. Your lyrics are what we ALL feel inside & I thank you for giving us all a voice! Keep it up-the sky's the limit, brother!
The cure is an alkaline diet and plenty of rick simpson thc oil.
My grandpa just died from cancer
My dude... It's everything I've been saying, and will likely die saying.. But here's an addition and a sincere thanks and story. Please, guys. Don't get bummed or bothered I just.. I needed to unload, yeah? And fuck man. I couldn't find a better video or song to relate it to.  Ten years ago, a tumour ripped apart my fucking spine. Blew it right the fuck up. Ten years ago? This shit would've sunk me. Seven months ago..? It came back. Higher up and more aggressively.  Three weeks ago? I walked the fuck out of the hospital after surgery.  I have even more spinal damage, nerve trouble, and a mind that's fucking addled by shit I can't even begin to understand anymore. And as I'm writing this, I'm listening to the tune. And I can't help but smile.  You just gave the perfect fucking drop to the shittiest month of my life so far and I cannot begin to thank you enough, or to even really begin properly conveying it in any other way than the cliche fan post.  So here it is from the deepest darkest most fucked-spot of my soul and all its broken nonsensical shit. Fucking. Thank. You. SO. DAMN. MUCH. for this song. I know its in no goddamn way that way, but holy fuck does it feel so bloody perfect.  Nerve damage be damned, pain be fucking ignored.   I'm putting this on again and I think I'll play it for a few dozen goes today. I need this tune too damn much.  PS, Tom. I do not give a flying fuck what anyone says. You, my dude, are a fucking saint. Thank you for the boost.  I really fucking needed this.
I like the chorus💙
Lost my best friend, brother and dad to cancer. There is a cure but why would they legalize it when big pharma makes so much money? My brothers chemo meds were 15k a month.
I am currently working in a Cancer facility.  I also recently lost a close family member to Cancer.   Thank you @TomMacdonald for this song and video --  It will mean so much to those who are fighting for their lives against Cancer.    God Bless Tom & Nova.
We have all lost someone to cancer . It should be the sign to not smoke , drink (etc). But yet we still do because we want to forget
Thank you for this! God bless all who are fighting this horrible disease!
I love you man. You are everything we need. Some "I'll kick your fucking ass-songs" and then Songs like this. You are awesome 🙏
Ommgggg yessss I neeeeedd more of these kind of messages.
Absolutely Beautiful ❤️, Cancer runs in my family so thank you.  Some are fighting 😭 it right now even, others have lost there battle. And a few won there's.
What an amazing song ❤ Prayers to all those fighting this battle 🙏 ❤
Thank you for this <3
“We’re dying to keep living” holy fuck why did that legit hit me so hard....
For real their is a cure for cancer their is a cure for aids but their is no $$ in curing people only when you prolong death. The way the system sees it they pay $100,000 one time to be cured or $100,000 ten times to prolong death. The amount of money they have to pay the doctors, nurses, medication, equipment, training, and facilities they have to make more money to pay all of that. If everyone pays $100,000 total instead of $1,000,000 Total a lot of hospitals would go down. This doesn't make it right though it just means our system is flawed. The problem now is its so in deep in its self that to fix it would cause a lot of problems so it would have to be fixed gradually over several years. What's crazy this whole concept is basically our entire government at this point.  Great song keep up the awesome work
I just ugly cried i lost my mama to cancer  12-28-2014 thank you tom
Thanks Tom you made me cry.
Amazing song tom really beautiful
This made me cry cuz I have notches I can turn to cancer anytime
Genius!
It funny how people sleep differently.  I sleep on my side  my girl sleeps on her stomach and the rest of the world sleeps on Tom Mcdonald
How can anyone dislike this!? Brought me to Tears cause I lost my dad to it in 09' it doesn't get easier. Much love tom
as a cancer survivor myself... thanks for using your voice for us... love you bro
Thank you for this
love and miss you aunt gerri and uncle bill
❤
Known friends and family members battling through cancer some have lost their lifes due to it, some survived. Hits hard knowing some of them never got to continue on with their life.
This is incredible! You really deserve a spot in the Hall of Fame for the poetry you create and enlightenment you bring to the world. Keep it up!
Damn bro....the music industry NEEDS you. We as a country need your art now more than ever
Outstanding
God my whole grandpas ide of my family died from cancer my uncle has it and it's so damn scary cause I have a chance of it. I hate cancer thanks tom
My baby sister, Kina. Fought colon cancer for 8 years. Passed away leap day 2016, she was 30, a mom, a nurse, a crazy cool sister. I miss her every day. She would have loved this one, Tom. Thank you ❤
tom   thanks for creating music for those who actually need it not people getting fucked up in clubs   thank you Hangovergang for everything
You are truly an amazing dude! Thank you for all you do! Much love!!!!
Simply beautiful, thank you for this❣🦋💜
This brought tears to my eyes. My dad has stage 4 prostate cancer so it's been real hard for me to see him like that. Love the song tom❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
Last year in June my dad was diagnosed wit stage 4 metastatic melanoma that started on a mole on his back amd spread to his lymph nodes under his left arm. Last week he got an MRI ans we found out he has a mass in his brain that's bleeding. Thank you for this Tom.
My dude tugging on those heart strings. This is great.
As a survivor I say Thank you!
CBD may be the answer. If you have cancer and are going to die, it is worth trying, even if it does not work. At least you tried. Chemo is worse than the disease.
😭😭😭😭😭
I needed this more now than ever. Truly appreciate you for doing this one. Much love bro. 🤘
Thanks Tom. Im goingnin for a colonoscopy this afternoon looking to see if I may have cancer.  I pray for all suffering 🙏 Gob bless
My Grandpa Gord is dying of stage 4 lung and kidney cancer. They say he has less than 6 months to live. I have already lost a few family members to cancer. Such a bummer. Much love💚✌😎 stay strong everyone.

I love how Tom not only supports those battling with Cancer but calls out big pharma for holding back a cure. Its true Tom form.
Who the f**k would dislike this song???? Bro what a powerful and truthful song it is
Thank you.. made me cry.. I beat mine!! Pray it stays away..!!
Tom. Thank you so much man. My Aunt had gotten Breast Cancer 8 years ago. She beat it and is still doing great to this day. I just sent her this song 10 mins ago to show her two things; one: Tom MacDonald is a fucking legend and a blessing. Two: This song hits home for her. Thank you man. Everyone in my family loves you and appreciates you.
Thank brother for this. Me and my wife love it. I feel this. My wife battled breast cancer my nana died from lung cancer my aunt died from breast cancer my cousin died from colon cancer.
I know it sounds bad but the world cant get over populated it would get bad
I have family, I have friends that is effected by cancer. This song choked me up the whole time. Tom your music is powerful. Thank you.
One of the most touching songs you've ever put out. I'm proud of everything you do and love every word you say. YOU, Tom, are a fighter and don't let no one take that away from you
From the moment I heard this kn your album I hoped you'd release it for the whole world... this really hits hard... but it helps and is going to help so many people. Thank you 👏🏻🙌🏻💗
@Tom MacDonald - The world NEEDS more artists and lyricists like you. Your music is real and the pain and honesty is tangible. Keep doing what you're doing and spreading the truth. Thank you for doing what you do.
Been fighting colon and stomach cancer since 2002 :(  A rough ride.  Lost my colon and a kidney in the fight.  I keep getting told to be tough by people who don't have to deal with the same issues.  It's rough to fight at times but I try to not let it win.  I will win.  Great song Tom, as usual.
This was really touching, I had a friend who I knew from military housing and we parted ways and I got the news that he had gotten brain cancer and I was only 10 and he was to when he passed away
Thank you for this fight anthem brother. Definitely hit home and shined a light of hope for many at the same time!!
Awesome message and video
🙏
My brother died from cancer when he was 9 months old :(
This is why you have become my favorite artist. The messages you give us in each song are real and you talk nothing but truth! We need more of this! Not enough artists out there that are like you Tom! Thank you! Truly and inspiration! ❤
You did it again Tom <3
I lost the 2 greatest ppl in my life to cancer. Thank u tom for this song. Teared up on this one
This just gave me chills! Lost a few loved ones to cancer.
My Dad was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer the year after his brother died of the same thing. He's actually doing really good right now, they're taking a break from immunotherapy to give his organs a break. I know he's doing really good, but I can't help but worry, and be angry that they stopped treatment.
💪
Song is super legit.  Tom is the man!!
Speak truth to power....you have gonna have the powers that be...paying attention to you...the   Elite evil of the world can give you cancer(I think) be safe much love for this one Mac.
Moving, very moving

I'm not crying, *you're* crying 😉 Thanks for this beautiful piece of art, Tom and Nova. I've lost 3 family members to cancer and I'm about to lose 4th. Fuck cancer🖕
Tom, you use your talent and platform to speak the words that others are afraid to. But with this one... you’ve used your talent and platform to lift up those who are in a battle and it’s going to change peoples lives. You’re a true saint
Beautiful
I always said it Tom is out of this world dude Lyricism is undisputed 🧠

I first like the song, then I watch it.
Nova well done on video capture the struggle really well so well done mad respect
Awesome
Oh my!!! YOU was so right with this one!! It is so sad, touching and honest!! I have had so many in my life pass away due to cancer and what you said in this video is everything i ask, i question and everything i felt. Amazing job Tom!!! You keep suprizing me everytime 🖤💋
I lost my aunt and grandfather this year to cancer, my good friend is also going through chemo currently. Thank you for thinking of them, they deserve this support.
"You can't experience strength Till you've struggled to carry the weight And you won't know why you have faith Till you look the Devil in his face And you don't know what you can take Till you realize you didn't break" Bruh. 🥲
Cancer has a cure. The number one cancer doctor in america ended up with cancer and he left the u.s to get treatment. He never had to do radiation or chemo. This is one of the reasons my family loves Tom he tells it how it is no matter the back lash. I live in the cancer treatment capitol of the u.s and have worked as a nurse for 14 years. That is one of many industries that will never have a "cure"
I Am Soo happy you did this... This song is going to help millions thank you Tom💜
Just found out my dad is terminal cancer a week ago
I just noticed the dad in this is the same actor that played the security guard in "Straight White Male".
There are several ways to treat cancer naturally. None covered by insurance or promoted by the medical field. Thank you for this song!!! ❤️
I don't have cancer but I have lost to it. This song will not only help those who fighting cancer but those left behind in it's destruction.
Lost my dad to cancer 3 years ago now. He waited over a year to even get looked at once the pain started because he didn't have insurance and couldn't afford it. By the time he was seen it was already stage 4. He died a year later after going through surgeries and treatment that just didn't work. Nothing stopped it or even slowed it down. Love your videos man and a huge fan of your music and your lifestyle. You guys do it all yourselves and don't need the system to support you because your a true artist and your music is actually good and has a real meaning.

Love it!!!
I made it through cancer treatment and I've been in remission for 9 years now.  When I finished treatment I asked my oncologist what is the best case scenario that I have?  His response was 5 years, but the cancer will come back, it's just a question where and how aggressive will it be?  Well at the five year mark my intestines completely ruptured and I went in to the hospital where I received 5 surgeries and was put into a drug induced coma in order to heal.  So I don't digest food very well but I count each day that I'm here as a gift from God who I believe is the main reason I'm still on this planet with y'all.  When my doctor told me five years I laughed in his face and I said well we'll see about that.  My best advice to anyone going through this is keep a positive attitude it really makes a huge difference.  It's hard as hell to do but I believe that positive thinking and fighting with all my heart in addition to God's help is why I'm still here.  Lose the negativity in your lives you don't need it and you don't deserve it.  My sister passed away at the age of 50 from cancer, my grandma in her 70's, my cousin in her 40's.  Also my oncologist gave me some of the best advice I've ever received during my radiation (30 straight days and 14 points being radiated) and chemo (2 rounds because it spread to my lungs during treatment) he told me make big plans right now while you're in treatment to do one of the biggest items on your bucket list.  So while I was in this treatment I planned a 2 week vacation to England and thanks to that little Aflac duck the entire cost was covered.  I went and oh I had a great time it was everything I thought it would be.  After getting out of the coma I went to Ireland for 2 weeks.  Make sure you take care of not only your physical self but also your inner self, it can be a difference between life and death.  Much love to you Tom for making this song, it truly touched my soul.
This is the tom i fell in love with the true and raw emotion he brings is what the industry needs
Brooooo I needed this! Thank you! #hangovergang #survivor #fuckcancer
😥this is real💔
Love it Bro!
Such an inspiration to so many people u 2!! Thx soo much for the care u put into everything you do. I havent been a fan too long maybe a yr. But oh boy that last 2 months your music has been playing every day!! God bless and have a great day woot woot!!
#FuckCancer this made me tier up on my drive to work. The fact I have had to many family member whome beat it and lost the battle against it, plainly sucks. Tom MacDonald you hit this one on the head when you said your new song would make people cry. Amazing song dude. Thank you!
Speaking the F$@!%* truth bro!!! Keep up the great work!!!
Wow!  This just made many memories surface of my mother who died from cancer, I don't cry often or at all, but this made me bawl, due to the memories. I guess thanks Mr. MacDonald for that. Great song!
It's all true
🙏
Truth.. Nothing Matter If You Don't Have Your Health ✔️
Another real one from Tom.  This song hits the heart for all of us.
There are more than 100 types of cancer, and within those specific types there are multiple severities, this is why there isn't a magical cure all. However, some types of cancer can be cured and actually has a high rate of survival. We all have internet, there is no reason you couldn't do a little research before making an entire song that makes you look stupid. Oh, and there are thousands upon thousands of people who literally dedicate their lives to saving people, and for you to accuse them of having a cure but instead of helping people, they just watch kids suffer and die, is completely disrespectful, and does nothing but spread misinformation.
Damn bro! So powerful! Lost my grandpa's to cancer so this was heart hitting. Absolutely love it! I know this is going to help many, many people. Thank you Tom!
Love it Tom!
How could one dislike this song..... hurtbags.
Damn this song literally gave me goosebumps.
Dang man. This made me cry.  So much of this!! So much!! My mom had cancer twice.  Thankfully we still have her with us.  But cancer is only part of the sickness.  As you mention and we saw on the video, I can see my dad bagging the fist to the wall cause he was trying to do all he could to pay for the treatments. He had to BEG for the doctors to help and treat my mom.  I can fell the desperation on this video for those who are fighting this sickness and the system that supports it! thank you so much for this!! Just thank you for putting it all into words.
Literally crying tom 💓
Prayers go out to everyone suffering from this horrible disease and their families. Keep fighting and stay strong folks
Powerful my brother thank you for being you
As a 39 year old, two times cancer survivor, I love this song. I was blessed enough that the two cancers I had were "easy" or if your gonna get cancer then those are the ones you want to get, at least that's what I'm told. But no matter what type of cancer it is it's never easy and neither are the repercussions on yourself or family. Stay strong everyone and God bless.
Beautiful song. I used to work at the Montreal hospital Children in the hemato-oncology department as a housekeeper. Saw so many sick children suffering but never stop fighting. Thanks for that song Tom.
Do you reckon he has any idea how talented he actually is? Lol
Every breath we take is an atempt of SUACIDE ATTEMPT! WE ARE JUST TO BLIND TO SEE.! THE HOLE WE DIG FROM THE GREAD OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION!  we really have no clue what we have to look forward to from life.
👍👍👍👍👍fire as always
Amazing work man, keep up the good vibes!!!!!
When you see this... May God bless you (John 6:54, Luke 22:15, Matthew 26:28) watv.org
Good song bro keep it going
You will touch alot of people man i have had alot of family members that died from cancer and they are fighters just like you tom macdonald!
Not even gonna lie I couldn’t make it all the way through this. Lost my Pops to cancer 3 months ago and I still struggle everyday. He was my best friend. From the time we found out until the time he passed it was only two weeks. Didn’t even get the time to wrap our heads around it. Even tearing up just typing this. I’m sure once I can sit through the whole track it’s really gonna help me out.
I LOVE YOUR SONGS I AM HUGE FAN YOU MAKE ME HAPPY WHEN I AM NOT
Thanks bro. My son Hunter is a brain cancer survivor and also a fan of yours. We’re currently back home in MA from NC to visit my dad who is at the end of his battle with Leukemia so this really hits home. 👊🏻🎗
Powerful. My dad got Hodgkins back in the late 70's and cobalt treatments were the protocol.  He died a few years later cancer free but died of cobalt poisoning.  The cure killed him!!
Absolutely amazing
My wife's step father has cancer... definitely hits home. Thanks for this Tom!! You tha 🐐!
Your touching so many hearts, really never cease to amaze me. Thankyou for all the work you put in to make these songs for people who need this in their lived🙏❤
"We are paying them to kill ourselves."
Someone that I know died this morning @ 5:25am from Stage 4 Cancer... This song hit home! Thank you 🙏🏼
This hits home man, thanks
😭 my mom is dying of pancreatic cancer right now. This cuts deap You're right Tom... the nights are long...
Awesome video thanks for your great music
Love songs like this. Speaking truth to power and about real things that affect us all.
This song means alot to me tom my mum and sister suffer with cancer so thank you tom keep up the amazing work
If this doesn't hit #1 on trending then YT is rigged. This one and Piss Off The World is my favorite so far
Tissue box is almost empty 😢 Tom this Song and Video is so Beautiful.  Last year(2019) we lost my Step Dad (58 yrs old) to Lung Cancer , I took care of him everyday and took him to every appointment. Made sure he ALWAYS was treated with  Love Respect Honor and Dignity. Also in December of 2018 found out my Nephew who at the time was 12 yrs old soon to turn 13 in January 2019 has a Brain tumor the size of a small pear in the deep center core of his Brain. My Nephew went through so many test and treatments that he is doing better but not Cancer Free😞 He still has to go for Testing to monitor the Tumor because they can not remove it 😞 He will turn 16 this coming January. I want to Thank you for this Beautiful song, also a Huge Thank you to Nova Rockafeller  &  Logan Fulton for doing an Amazing job on the Video Much love to all of you.  Also my prayers go out to every and anyone who is fighting Cancer or has lost someone. My only advice is to stay strong,  know that you are loved😍
Another winner! Im not crying your crying  stop looking at me! Nice touch with the unicorn 🦄 butthole reference.
This is so good
Sad but so true
This song hit hard, I lost my grandma, mother in law and my step dad to cancer, I've been telling people for years there is a cure for this crap, my step dad sold almost everything he had just to pay his med bills,I was lucky enough to have the money  to buy his two bike that he loved, if I could I would take everybody's cancer put it in a box and take it to hell with me and I would respect the decision I made to help get rid of this shit, sorry for the long message. 😢😢😢
That was deep! Made me cry. My father is going threw the fight and we needed this song! Thank you so much for being you Tom and nova.
Never a disappointment
This is prolly the best song of the year from anyone out their. Tom you are an inspiration to most and I say that because if I said all that would mean the blind and ignorant would hear a loud pop and their heads would be out of their ass. Keep it up and do you, never waiver! Your amazing just wanted to tell you that just incase nobody else has. One day I would love to meet you and thank you for all the shit you have helped me through.
Love this video man. Your a good man and I love the message you send with your music. Im just a regular dude but I relate and I am inspired by the music you make, probably will never even read this. But I wanted to say thank you, thank you for adding positivity to a negative and dark world.
This song hits home not bc of cancer but PTSD suicide. You killed it Tom and you were right about even the toughest people gonna cry to this song!!!
if this song doesn't make you cry or misty eyes, we can't be friends.
I lost my sister to brain cancer 2015, and survived bladder cancer 2016. Cancer sucks!!
You are awesome
Bro I’m crying 😭🙏🏼💜
imagine disliking this video
Preach!!
If I get cancer and die they gonna play this at my funeral
Thank you. This song is fire. ❤️
As an adult in remission, went through a year of chemo when I was 12. As a metal head \m/ where music got me through a lot of my hard times, you sir, are a lyrical genius and are an inspiration to millions! Keep up the great work!!
Tom brother,  you have no idea how much this touched my heart. I lost my father to cancer at 15, my mother at 30, my sister at 27. Cancer has eradicated my entire family. Held my father's hand till he took his last breath, and laid in my mothers bed with her while she bounced back and forth between heaven and earth. It changed my life to the point of near destruction. If it wasn't for music and incredible songs I would have given up. This is a healing song for the broken. ###Give us the cure!!!  Much love to you Tom and Nova. Truly the best you are!!
Thank you for this song, I’ve lost friends and have friends who are going through this right now. My husband is dealing with it too
Got me crying like a baby!!! Beautiful
This one was Deep, it touched me lost family members to #HATECANCER... For everybody who goes thur this i understand your pain. Thank You Tom and Nova. Mad 🤍🖤 Love 4 you Guys. #HOG4LIFE 🤘🤟
I just lost a family member a week ago from cancer. Its disgusting that all the money, all the years of research and nothing because the rich get richer on disease.
To the 49 who felt the need to dislike a song like this eat a dick an die... Great song bro my sister was just diagnosed with breast cancer thanks Tom shes gonna love this!!
Deep
Very good song. Let's make this go viral
Am here earlier
About to share this with everyone I know. There is not one person in this world that has not been touched by cancer in some way. Thank you so much for this song.
“you are a fighter, when it's dire, you burn brighter in the dark”  I might need to get this tattooed!! I’m a cancer survivor and I pray for those who are fighting their battles. It’s not easy, and even when you win it’s still a struggle.
Love this 🖤
I lost my Dad and he lost his Mom, to cancer. He never got over my grannies death. But I made sure my Dads death didnt consume my life the way my Grannies death consumed his. Dont allow death to hault you from living. People who are reading this; if you lost a loved one due to cancer or anything for that matter, just remember your parents live through you. They are still alive through you. Allow them to keep alive through you. But dont allow that to determine your destiny. Live your life how you want and make them and yourself proud. Much love,   Thanks for the new song Tom, as always.  🙏❣
Wow brotha u really know how to tug at heart strings. Another great song and video. Keep up the good work and dont listen to the haters . You r a amazing artist cant for the next 1. #HANGOVERGANG
Fucking awesome video. Not only is this an awesome video but an outstanding message.  Keep it up sir and continue putting out the truth.
my favorite song off gravestones. so glad he made a video to it. tom can do it all. the truth 100%
thank you tom... so much luv from nicaragua!
Thank you for making this song. I was diagnosed at 18.. I’m 36 now, 18 years a survivor. This song meant a lot!

Damn
Been fight for a few years now you’re music is so insightful thank you for the song it’s beautiful. People don’t know how hard it is unless they are on the inside with you . It’s hard to have gas money for Dr. appointments once you pay all your co pays don’t forget the 10 pills a day to stay in pain for years I can’t remember that last time I was able to just feel ok I miss it thank you again for the beautiful song love you
I’ve been touched by cancer! But this is a powerful survivor song for anyone going through anything that’s my view!
If there is a person out there that knows how to cure it and won’t should be beaten to death I’ve lost too many friends and family members to cancer
My daughter had battled cancer this last few years. She is a fighter. This song is great. Thank you so much for this.
Yep. Your right. I fucking cried.
How can you dislike this?
The truth will offend people.. Maybe you should have done gravestones after this video... Lol
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Too busy crying. You did this justice.
I wish I was the one cancer took instead of my mom
wow, this hit home man...
Cancer is a real pandemic not covid
🙏🙏bless
😭😭3yrs ago lost my sis because of cancer 🙏those who are battling it my you get through it 🙏
This is amazing and sad because it's the truth and I know some people who have cancer it's sad that cancer touches anyone it wants too that type of disease of cancer should have already had a treatment to kill it in one day instead of weeks and weeks of people fighting and suffering from cancer Tom this will get out there no matter what happens everyone one of your fans including me will fight YouTube to get it to number 1 on the charts
Thanks Tom
Speechless!
Boom hits home
Its beautiful
Bravo...
Great song. The only thing, you can know where your gonna go when you die. Turn your life to Jesus. God bless America
Thank you for this from a woman struggling with breast cancer ❤️❤️
Amazing as per expected,  your special bro , always looking forward to what comes next with Tom ❤🔥
Lost my Mom, Dad, Grandmas, and Uncles to cancer. Thank you for this.
Thank you so much for making this it hits  home for me right now . my big sister is in the fight for her life
Wow,  gave me chills.
Great video! There must be something wrong with me, i didn't shed any tears ❤️
My mother is fighting this right now. You made me tear up. Thank you...
The good might go to heaven and the bad might go to hell, but no one wants to leave here you can tell
Why can't the fuckin leaders of our countries think this way?. God knows everyone else does. Thanks for this Tom.
Thats the tom that I'm here for!  Speak your truth!
Not gonna lie man this made me cry. I've lost a loved one to cancer, and this kinda hit home. Now don't get me wrong. The song is really good. What's sad is he's rite there is a cure, but it has to do with money. Why have someone pay? we'll say $1,000 for a cure. When they can slowly kill them with poison, and charge $10,000+ multiple times for some bullshit treatment that doesn't work, and then lie through their teeth. Telling you that everything is okay. When you can clearly see that the bullshit isn't working, all its doing is slowly killing your loved one, Keeping them in pain all the time, and constantly puking. The saddest part of all is watching them go through this as their body withers away knowing that there is a cure, but it won't be released because big pharmaceutical companies would lose money.
My daughter was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (cancer of the blood and bone marrow) at 18 months old, and hers had spread into her central nervous system. Now, 3.5 years later, my daughter is healthy and strong. It took 2.5 years of daily chemo, scans, labs, tests, spinal taps, chemo in her spinal fluid and around her brain, hospital stays, and crazy illnesses but she has made it!! In 4 more years, she will be considered cured. Thanks for this amazing song Tom. I’ve always loved your music, and this some hits home and it hits hard. Keep up the amazing work. 🙌🏻
Both of my parents died 10 days apart from Cancer, thank-you! Love you and Nova!
My Dad has cancer in his liver and the doctors said he would have 3 months to live but it’s been 9 months and he has fought a lot of terrible thing for me and my little sister but this is his biggest and hardest fight yet and he still fights so he can spend enough time with us and listening to this song makes me think of how strong and how much of a Survivor he is and what he’ll go through to just to make sure we’re happy. Thank you Tom for making me remember god bless you.
As touching and amazing as the song is, my Aunt passed away from Cancer and I have been saying the same thing for years that there is a cure and its all about money, that aside lets also mention what a great video done by Nova and Logan, I was blown away by the video alone, Huge respect for all of you.
Everybody argues about healthcare the problem with healthcare is the cost.
Tom you did another awesome video
How can any thumbs down this? Y’all crazy!
I seem to be having trouble watching this through my tears.
So beautiful Tom!!!! Love it,lost 3 of my family too cancer!🤘🤘💙🙏🏻
Music for the people not the industry!!! Love what your doing Tom!! Keep it up
Wow my guy this is not what I expected from you but damn it’s a touching song and speaks the truth! Good work bro I’m a tough fucker but it’s kind of a tear jerker!!
I was literally talking to my husband about this the other day, my sister is a 5 yr surviver of lymphoma, lost my dad 5 yrs ago to cancer. I was like how have we been fighting cancer for decades and still having to use chemo and radiation 🤔 but yet they are getting a vaccine for the uh care covid in Less than a year. 🤷‍♀️
You made me cry.     Shit fuck I'm at work.      Thanks bud your music does  so much so so much I hate cancer more then anything.
Woww just woww
Wow thank you for the reminder that we are made stronger thru the fight. Much love
Tom, you have an absolutely beautiful voice. Thanks for speaking the truth.
😍
Got me in my feels 😢😥😍😢😥
Don't mind me just crying like a baby
This song definitely hit home we just found out my grandma had about 2 months left it's in her brain and liver everywhere and a year ago my grandfather past away losing the fight love you man I was a addicted to crack and alcohol almost 2 years now and your music means alot to me
Wow!!! Thank you Tom!  Was not ready for this one.  I was 13yrs old driving my mom to chemo, God bless her soul.  She was a fighter but she is in Gods hands now.  Went through cancer with my dad 7 years ago.  This was his second battle.  Strong man and is living life still today!  God bless everyone battling this horrible thing and God bless the USA.
You titled a song the C word which is brave of you and this song will allow others to be brave in the face of adversity, Thanks Tom and Nova
who did you lose?
one year ago TODAY, I lost a youth kid from my church. She was an amazing kid. This song hit me hard especially since its the release date and also the anniversary of her death. RIP Maggi
Cancer sucks but I'm still here. Thank you
Wow tom mcdonald you impress with every new cut thank you man and thank you nova
Seriously chills and goosebumps this is fire truth and awakened ness 🙏🏼❤️❤️❤️🌹🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥I LOVE YOU MUCH LOVE LOVE THIS
Much love for this video/song!
Thank you guys for being conscious about your music and about the issues that you are writing about and for speaking truth about our society and how we treat each other and for reminding us all that there are other emotions besides anger light compassion and empathy for others if we could all just treat each other like we want to be treated things would be a lot better keep the fire burning love you guys
I was not mentally prepared enough for this song. 😭😭😭  What a powerful and heartbreaking message.  Thank you for putting yourself out there and writing such and incredible track.  Nova killed it with the video too!  Love you guys, 🙏
I just found out that my favorite person in the world has cancer and I appreciate this ❤️
However its kinda make me bump up to make song or lyrics that could make people thinking
You rock Tom... i cried.
Seeing everyone’s stories in the comments just shows the huge impact you have on your growing community. Reading through here made me tear up because It’s just so amazing to see how a song can bring together so many people and gives people a place to share their stories knowing they can have others to relate to. I could go on forever about the true beauty of what you’re doing. Keep going tom, you’re saving people.❤️
This right here is why your needed in this world. Wish I could sit for a half hour with you. I know I have story you need to sing for children sold on the black market
Powerful words Tom and another awesome song
Well, I didn't want to start my Friday crying,  but leave it to Tom to burst my bubble. Wonderful song!😢❤
This hits deep for me, thanks tom
Damn. I love this song. I lost my mother 10 years ago after she fought cancer for 10 and a half years. This song brings so many feels for me. I just love your stuff. Keep it up Tom!
I'm not one to sheds a tear but dam....TOM MACDONALD FOR PRESIDENT ...
I saw this guy on a YouTube ad which I normally skip but he hooked me... I'm a fan as this man speaks truth and we need more!!! GOD BLESS YOU!
The people that disliked probably had there family that had cancer and that why they hateing rip to them but if you hate then no rip for you
Amazing song. Love it like always Tom! As per usual Nova did a stunning job on the video as well !
Another hit as always Tom. Sad part is that there is no money in a cure, but they make a fortune off of treatment...
Thank you Tom, I got diagnosed with stage 2 Hodgkin’s lymphoma last year right before I was supposed to be deployed and it sucks but I’m making it through. Thank you Tom ❤️
How can anyone thumbs down this song?!
I cried like a Big ol BayBay!!!! This was a masterpiece
We all lost someone to cancer or will. Its a plague.
Thank you Tom for this amazing song. It means a lot to me and my family.
Wow powerful message. I lost my dad 4yrs ago to cancer and uncle on October 5th. Both very strong men fought it to the end. It runs in our family I'll prolly die of cancer too.
Thank you for making this song... When I was 18 my dad died at 3:36am Thanksgiving morning from cancer right infront of me... He was at home on morphine drip and bed ridden... Hospice did what they could but their was nothing we could do for him... We didnt have the money and even if we did the doctors said between the blood clots and the cancer, they couldn't do anything about either because of the other... I was holding his hand as he took his last breathe that day... I'll never forget the sound he made as he took his final breathe...  I had to hold it together for my mom and my sister, but a part of me that can't be fixed was broken that day.. I wouldn't wish that on anyone ever and I hope that one day no one will have to face it again.
I can see the love you have for people in your eyes. I lost my Mom when I was 7 to cancer... It really put down a dark road for a long time. I got past it, but haven't been positive about much until the last few years. I'm 34 now and still struggling but I have my wife and kids that always kept me going. I'm finally motivated in life, not just to survive but to strive. I have a goal and I'm working towards it. I hope it will pay off, not just for me but everyone around me. Thank you for the song.
We love you Tom! You are such an inspiration to me and everybody else that has found you. Hangover Gang for life!!
You start dying the day you are born. That being said, the Pharmaceutical industrial complex exists to fleece the American people with treatments and not cures.
Thanks for sending this video it's helping really really much because my grandma's in the surgery room
My mom died in June this year after a November diagnosis. I know exactly where she is. In Heaven, watching over her grandchildren. Miss you, Mom.
Lost my grandma to cancer about 4 years ago and it was after they said it was in remission but it came back and couldn’t stop it it’s crazy how it happens like that love the song keep it up🤘🏻
Fellow survivors, we are worlds stronger than the disease that tried to kill us. Rep your type and your success stories. 💚💚 Non Hodgkins Lymphoma, Sophomore year of high school. Right after I watched my little sister lose a leg and get new bone marrow. GRIND DONT STOP JUST BECAUSE WE WANT IT TO
Love you Tom!!! Keep it going!
Another awesome song and video you were right made me cry
Tears dropping still 2nd time through! My mom is a survivor along with many of my family and friends. Thank you Tom MacDonald love you bro!
i will never forget seeing my grandfathers actual cancer tumor and how it impacted him and the rest of the family. Good thing is, he never lost his sense of humor =) Rest In Peace.
Who put water in my eyes?!
👏👏👏👏👏.
In tears here Tom...Lost my momma 12 years ago this month to colon cancer...CANCER SUCKS...Love the song..
Always so Raw and Honest. Nothing but the Truth. No Sugarcoated BS. Love it. Keep doing what you do Tom 😎👍 Love it ❤️🔥😎
Oh my God the tears 😭😭😭😭 thank you so much for this! As someone who has had a cancer scare myself as well as numerous loved ones who have lost the fight or are currently fighting we needed this!! Forwarding this song to everyone i know, God bless bro 💙
Thank you Tom, the moment I heard this song on your album I hoped you would make a video for it.
This hits me close to home.  Just lost a couple of people who i hold dear to me recently to cancer. Thank you tom for making this one
Considering my son had leukemia, currently in remission, this hit me hard. Sitting here,  a grown ass bearded man, tearing up listening. Man this hit me. Thank you Tom, thank you so much.🧡
Great song Tom thanx from the Netherlands 🇳🇱
Brother died brain/spinal cancer.   Nephew died osteosarcoma.  Uncle stomach cancer--died.  You can beat cancer. My friend beat colon cancer.  But...if I get cancer, I will not do chemo.  It's a horror show.  Most of the cancers in my family have a low survival rate even with treatment. Because of the types of cancer we get, the chemo our family gets is harsh.  No one seems to tolerate it well.   I see no reason to go through the torture of chemo with little hope of anything but more pain.   Watching people I love go through cancer, chemo, hospice---has solidified my belief that people should have the right to choose death at a certain point.  At a certain point, they get to a place where no pain killer works, they can't walk, they can't talk.  Sometimes they slowly starve or suffocate because they can't swallow or eat.  Just no.
Powerful
Here before Youtube lowers the viewer count on this video.
i already loved this song on your album. this video is heartbreaking and good. tom your amazing!
I am at a loss for words. I am a fighter and the hit hard! Thank you ❤️
My dad passed away from cancer unexpectedly in 2019. This song means so much to me. ❤ I can't listen to it without tearing up. Thank you for this song. You're such an amazing artist. #hog4ever
Cancer is a way for the elite to control the amount of people on this earth.
The biggest difficulty with treating cancer is that the cells are not foreign to the body, so any treatment that targets the cancer also targets the organ that’s infected. Another massive reason why there’s no cure for cancer is that there are so many different kinds of cancers, there can’t be a blanket cure for all of them. They’re all unique and horrible. My dad has a type of leukemia that has only had a treatment within the last 10-15 years. He’d be dead without it and the pharmaceutical company that makes it subsidizes the treatment for him.
I spread every Tom song willingly on on any platform I can....this one...THIS ONE everyone needs to hear...I will learn the words and shout it whilst walking down the street!!! Thank you Mr. Tom my birthday twin amd fellow Canadian!! Always doing us proud ❤❤
Baking soda cures cancer. Search it
The UN classifies cellphone radiation as a class 2 carcinogen, same as lead...
Keep going in this direction, man. The chorus still sucks, but at least it's not just all about YOU and cringey AF, lol.
Thank you so much for this song I lost my sister when I was 9 to brain cancer and my grandpa to stage 4 esophagus cancer I wish  where able to fight through it I think about them every day
:)
I gotta say Tom my whole life I've listened to music not for the lyrics but for the music itself, however your song's are different I can't help but to dive into your lyrics.....your music is different (in a great way) keep up the great work man and don't worry about the haters we all have haters just know that more love you at the end of the day!
U two done it again tom u and nova are the greatest
This is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you so much. You captured the truth of it.
I fucking love this song. My mom survived stage 4 breast cancer, but because of the chemo they used (she was treated in the early 90s) she now has congestive heart failure to contend with. My mom has always been a huge inspiration to me because of her immense strength in the face of adversity.  Thank you for this song, Tom. It really means a lot to me and I'm sure it means a lot to many others. I hope that everyone fighting cancer hears this and is encouraged to continue fighting no matter what.
A bigger fear of ever getting cancer is your child getting it
I'm glad he made this song!🎶 So true and I can't believe nobody thought to make a song about it before he did! 😊
I lost my Mother and Grandmother to this horrible disease.  Thank you for this song, Thank you for nailing the emotions behind this fight, and thank you for shedding some light on the Big Pharma shell game.  They make way too much money keeping us sick to ever let us truly be healed.
Me and my brothers lost mum to this horrible disease 💔turn our world upside down. I’m also convinced that there’s a cure
Thank u Tom. Beautiful song. I wish it was possible to be able to use it in my advertising for my cleaning company.  We are a member of Cleaning For A Reason . We give 2 free cleanings a month to cancer patients and i just think this song is so perfect to promote that portion of our business. Keep killin it bro.
😢 this song made me cry! This song will help so many people!
Fuck this song hits home. A year to stop covid. Cancer is a hell of a lot more deadly and been around for a long time. Big pharma thinks there is no money in a cure. What they don't realize myself and every other person fighting would give  everylast cent.
JESUS CHRIST TOM!!!! OK admit it you're just trying to take the position as my Rap GOAT. and I'll admit that you're putting the work in
Bro. Cancer is one word. But the disease is like a thousand!
Amazing man, such an amazing song. My nana has Kidney Cancer and its been really hard on her and all of us to see. This song is nothing but the truth.
Only one word for this song: Masterpiece
my dad just died of cancer and u helped me get through it alone in colorado i know u wont see this but thank you
Tooooom!!! I honestly love this song it has a great connection personally ....MacDonald is seriously first of his erra
Man love this almost lost my mother to stage 3 colo rectal cancer. Thankfully she is in remission.  Much love from Texas
My mom and aunt survived lung cancer but their bodies were weaked by the treatments they both passed a few years after beating the big c. Prayers for anyone battling this or having a love one deal with it.
great message and lyrics as always 👍🎶🎶
My grandfather died from lung cancer due to smoking. It was odd and sad to see a once strong man become more and more weak.
Thank you for this. My wife’s father just got diagnosed with lung cancer and starts treatment next week. The industry doesn’t care who capitalizes off the billions but we are fighters. Continue to fight and prove the world wrong.
This is great man 🙏🏼🙏🏼
Fire as always. Your both beautiful souls 👐🏻👐🏻👐🏻👐🏻👐🏻
Dude this song just got me all up in my feels, my mom went through two chemo treatments and is a survivor, thank you for this song
This one is a tear jerker damn
Damn Tom you were right this did make me cry.
So true!!!!!!!!!!!! It’s a strong truth
Wow
Thank you so much tom this song means the world to me and my family. My daughter has A.L.L (Acute lymphoblastic leukemia) shes done so well with treatment and proves daily to me that nothing's impossible. Keep going with these amazing songs. H.O.G FOR LIFE
Truth in lyrics is what I love to hear
spreading love and hope....love yall
💜
a yooo 28,723
It's why I have doubts in God.... I understand that people get cancer because of lifestyle and environment.... but babies should not be born with cancer only to die.... after a few painful days that they will never get to even understand. They don't even have a chance to be babptised.....
There is a cure
More truth. Real truth. Thank you.
Very good song you are going to inspire people Tom
Amen brother!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Beautiful song ❤️
As per usual Mr. Macdonald you create a song that kicks everyone right in the feels! HOG for life!
True
💣🚀🔭🐧
my smaller cousines dad died of cancer, we spoil him, we love him, we say yes to almost anything he throws at us, and its mostly reasonable requests, that kids lightning in a bottle, so thank god it did not slow him down! only the young have potentiall!!! shout outs to all the personell that is on the front and offcourse to the patients that have unclear outcomes so we understand this desease better! what i admire is the fire in the eyes that a person has, usually very strong people with good character and strongwilled! they look just a tad bit wheatherd, but thats where the character shows up in the appearance... i mean they actually fought against the elements! lets not forget that! and having a past makes you interessting and if that past is cancer then you better not forget the odds of survival! so be proud!
Damn this hit home
Beautiful
*everyone in the comments* : Yeah, cancer is just a big business that people make money from, you're the man, Tom!   Tom Mac: Profiting off song about cancer...  🤦‍♂️
Bro all you said is true
Oh wow damn Tom you got me 😭 on this one! I have lost many loved ones and friends to this disease and know many who have survived and are currently battling CANCER. This hit me deeply.   For those battling, STAY STRONG & KEEP FIGHTING! For those who have beat it, IM SO PROUD OF YOU FOR NOT GIVING UP! For those who sadly lost their battle, MAY YOU REST PEACEFULLY AND NO LONGER SUFFERING!  MY HEART GOES OUT TO ALL WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY CANCER 😭💔   #fuckcancer
Damn it Tom! Yep....I'm crying.
Love it!
You are sooo good at what you’re doing, Tom.
I turn this song on on the way to work started bawling in my car. Cancers killed too many people I love
I love all your music its all amazing keep up the good work bro straight factssss💯, also my grandma died when i was 9 years old because of breast cancer memories will always live on.
Another banger tom. I only found you 3 weeks ago and you're my favourite music artist
Bro this shit hits CLOSE!!! My mom past from cancer last year at 58 and my pop's was told last week he has cancer 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Tom, it's very touching. I am going to go out on a limb here bro. I want to call what you are doing logic rap!? It inspires thought and invokes feelings. Thanks for your heart and soul bro!
I am 57yrs old, a HUGE Tom MacDonald fan, & I was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer on August 19, 2020 😪😪. You have no idea what this video means to me Tom ❤❤. You are so correct in ALL the lyrics of this song. Scared is an understatement 😪😪. The chemo treatments alone makes you think sometimes maybe death would be better?? It makes you so freakin sick 😪😪. But thank you Tom for your words of strength ❤❤. You're going to help a lot of people with your music. I really needed to hear this Brother ❤❤❤❤❤
Man I got bro love for you Tom! You are truly a lyrical magician. I love that you fight against all odds with big corporations. You are here to stay you have made your stamp in this world.  Good job “aeh”
I cried
Another great track tommy boi. Massive love for u bro ❤
Damnit tom. I'm almost 40 im not supposed to be balling my eyes out anymore.
Thank you Tom and this song is 100% facts as usual!
Go watch Forks over knives and eat a whole foods plant based diet that'll reverse the cancer. NO not a vegan one, those guys are crazy.
Love how you spit the truth 🤜🤛
He right i cried
Keep up the good work  tom😁👍
Tom has already been debunked
i just cried.........
This hit home hard. Thank you for this one!!!
Great song Tom I actually cried from watching it
Awesome song Tom love this
One of the best tunes you've put out! Love it
Exposing a 100 billion dollar industry and motivating people to keep living, all the while without cussing once. Tom MacDonald you are worthy of praise. Can’t wait to see what you come out with next!
Mom and dad both died from cancer within 3 years of each other , thank you Tom God bless you ,I'm crying
Well said
❤️❤️❤️
Thank you.
Remember. Stop waiting for treatments of cancer. Most cancera can be preventes. Eat healthy, exercise, etc
Best song ever every word 110% true all your family must be proud of you as all the fans are much love from the UK
Thank you for all you do!
How does anyone give this a thumbs down? 🤷🏼‍♂️
I forgot
Apparently you can make grown men cry, bravo. 5 years ago, she not even once smoked or drank yet she got throat cancer. She was just a pre-k teacher, it didn't care. First the throat, then the brainstem, then brain, we were so lucky to be there for that brief moment of clarity before... her 9 month struggle was over.  Thanks Tom & Nova,  RIP LAH
Thank you so much for this. I was just diagnosed with parathyroid cancer   just last Friday. Before Canadian Thanksgiving.  Its destroying me  and my family is distraught 😔😢   Its a hard battle... and I thank the world for people like you tom..   I also lost my father in 2015 to liver cancer.   Now im fighting 5yrs later myself.    Thank you tom ❤❤❤❤❤ we love you
Hey I’m early... NOICE
My dad has stage for cancer and every day isn't promised. Thank you Tom
I mean literally everything he said in the song is true and I think that Tom spend a lot of time researching  topics that he discuss  in the songs so he gets them exactly right props to you on that one loved it banger as  always
This right here Tom. This hits different. Thank you Tom.
Thank you Tom both my cousins have cancer.
Yo Tom this song is amazing. I've had five people die from cancer in the last 2 years pretty immediate family.
I've actually had this song on repeat cause it makes me tear up everytime. I have an aunt battling stage 4 lung cancer and I have had an uncle die of prostate cancer literally 10 years ago this year, im so appreciative of this song, it was much needed. Thank you so much Tom. You are truly an inspiration.
Genious.
I lost my dog this year cause of cancer an years prior this song is the truth
Wow man this hits hard for me . And you  did it agiain🔥🔥🔥🤘🏻
Your afraid but you fight I fight for my kid's never give up thank you for caring
I guarantee this song will help so many people get through the tough times
Super cool it's going to connect with a good few people.🤘🇬🇧
I’ve heard this song about a million times on the album... but putting a video to the lyrics just make it more real. Beautiful song. ❤️
I respect that you make songs that will definitely not be bangers but they mean something and carry a message. Keep telling these people about pharma and the medical industrial complex. People need to wake up. 90B in donations, huh?! 😳
And this is what makes him the best musician out there if you ask me
Thanks bro it means a lot my grandma died from cancer and this made me feel good
I think “growth” is the only word that effectively encapsulates the trajectory of your music. Well done 👍
Thank you Tom. Your music is always an inspiration and I love what you do
You are tapping the pulse on Americans zeitgeist.
thank u for this 💕💕 and thank u to everyone who allowed him to make a living saying the shit that they would never play on the radio
Bro this is amazing! I love it! My family had fought cancer like crazy! My father lost his battle to stomach cancer 3 years ago my grandmother step mom and aunts have battled and so against breast cancer! Keep up the amazing work!
omg I heard this on pandora this morning straight 🔥🔥🔥 the line your family in the room someone will get it and I hope its me because I don't wanna see any of my family go though this. so many people in my family have doe from cancer. it just sad 😥
Thank you 💕 for this ik how it's feels
Great  Message. Love your work my man.
Damn Tom. You gotta make me cry at work? Good fucken song though.
I love the fact that you always call out what's wrong with this nation and make it so clear that you paint pictures in everyone's minds so we understand in the best way. Between you and upchurch you guys have an army standing behind you and we will ALWAYS have y'all's backs through thick and thin brother! I can't express the appreciation and gratitude we all have for you guys. I think I speak for all of us when I say WE GOT YOU!!
I don’t wanna hit that thumbs up, because cancer has taken so many people from so many more. But, I thumbs up because Toms thought process is so similar to mine. Though I’m not as influential, that is why I use your music!
this gave me goosebumps............................................................................................... nuff said.
There’s def a cure but big pharma is hiding it
My wife passed away from cancer and we had a  year and a half year old son💔💔 this hit me hard it’s been a struggle everyday.. thank yo for this Tom!!
Made me cry.. bless
Tom this is beautiful thank you and Nova for all your hard work 🙏
Amazing song and video bro. You just gave everyone dealing with this a anthem
https://youtu.be/WQnYq5Q-4D8
My fiancé’s dad has had cancer for about 6 years and it’s been getting progressively worse. She gets really emotional over the thought of losing him so I’m not really sure if I should show her this song or not 😕
This touched deep I lost my dad to cancer 2 days before my high school graduation on June 18th 2009. FUCK CANCER
Thank you Tom you are the .3 of 1percent speaking truths I gave up on human race long time ago. Probably about the time you were born. I've been a nomad for close to 30 years. I wander hi ways of the most beautiful places to take time to take it in. Nothing but a backpack and the boots on my feet. I knew as a kid we don't have much time. Even if we were to magically get along. This race has made this planet unlivable. But the planet will live on. I just want to enjoy the beauty that's left. I definitely feel richer than most only threw my experience. I live on nothing no joke I have my health an hart to keep me going. Thank you for being you. Lizard
I just love this song!! Will definitely share with friends and family
I have a reptile friend who is currently battling cancer, the second time around. She's such a sweet girl, only 30 or 31, the doctors are basically playing with her. Not giving her stronger pain meds, she cries for hours in end from the pain. They jack around her appointments even rescheduling her while she's on the way because they failed to have an anesthesiologist in the office at the time. We are hoping some RSO will save her because it's just laughing at the chemo this time.. I'm hoping like hell it works, she would be a great loss to a lot of people..    I watched my grandfather lose his battle with prostate cancer in 2003.. my grandma died of cancer and a broken heart 2 years later. She gave up after he died and basically just let it take over. She wasn't happy without him.. they spent over 30 years of their lives together.. cancer is rampant and we all know they have a cure, just a patient cured is a customer lost..  Now I'm sitting here crying, thanks Tom lol.  Great video as always.
I went through cancer four years ago, 28 years old facing cancer was really rough. thanks tom for this song
To anyone that has it or know someone who Is or has I love yall keep up the fight many many prayers you all of you and your loved ones
Another great song about the truth
another great song
the audio is off to you rapping just fyi
fuck cancer!!!!  those affected YOU ARE strong and beautiful keep fighting!! prayers going out to all <3

I lost my mom to brain cancer a few years ago, I miss her every day. She worked everyday taking care of home bound people as a home care nurse until two months before the cancer claimed her I strive to have half her strength despite my disabilities.  Thank you for all your music Tom!
Wazzis? Someone has been added to the film crew? Curiosity is peaking.
Called mom after this one.
I'm reading through the comments and it breaks my heart. To anyone who's in a hard time stay safe and smile as much as you can. I hope you'll get past whatever it is. I LOVE YOU
I was Born with heart disease. I've had to tell my family goodbye 5 different times.  This song strikes deep for me.
Thanks for this tom ..i lost my father and a very good friend a few years ago to cancer and almost lost my aunt the same time ..ur a legend and a TRUE  artist
Holy crap refreshing forever since 9am hahah 🤙 keep up the good work Tom! Respect the grind
When you said it was gonna make me cry, I didn’t know it was like that... love you Tom. I’ve lost so many to Cancer
This was fucking beautiful, literally an amazing song thank you Tom. Glad to see you are well my friend
Damit tom why bro my uncle just died a month and a half ago from cancer
Man I have to tell you that this is one of the realest songs I have heard. You hit my thoughts on cancer 1000%. I love your music man. You and Nova just continue to kill this stuff. Gladly have your two new cds sitting with my medals in my closet while I have it all downloaded on my phone.   To everyone fighting the battle, “you are stronger than you think.” We are praying for you and love you.
Another real ass song. Thanks bro
I lost my grandmother to cancer. This really hits home. As does most of your music. Keep doing you bro. Your touching hearts.
Omg bro ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💯🙏.
I can say i relate. I lost my bestfriend, my grandma at 11 and it hurt. It just hurt.
So great so deep so lit
Coming from a two time cancer survivor I just absolutely love this song.
This one hit fucking deep! I lost my mom last year to cancer!  Thank you for this song!
You done it again Tom. Hit the nail bang on the head. Thank you Man.
Finally!! After all those hints! 🔥 👑
Wow. You really do have an unbelievable understanding....
My mom died of cancer the day before mother's day 2 years ago. She held on for my brother to come across the country and see her, she died that same day and I never got to say goodbye. This is the first time I've cried about it since  then.
good work bro
Tom!- I wish you all the peace you want! And I pray for strength to everyone fighting it...Amen💐🌟
Great song 👌 Love it.
This song hits the nail on the head!!! I was diagnosed with #kidneycancer last year and had my surgery 11/14/2019 and you have no idea what goes through a persons mind when you are told you have cancer.. I went through so many emotions and the hardest was “Why me?”  Thank you for making this video and song because it is true, that you never know how strong or what kind of a fighter you are, until you are in it!! 🧡🎗🎼 Keep singing the truth!!!
Thank you Tom, I lost my sister to cancer back in '07.  Even if you're a fighter, you can't always win the fight sadly.
Thanks man I lost my Grandpa from cancer during my mission it's crazy you never know when it will effect you!!!
WOW!!! Tom always hit the emotions hard. Thank you for being a voice that refuses to go silent.
Ay ay spread this🔥
This song made me cry! It touched my heart brutha!
Thanks Tom For this. Both parents are cancer survivors. New favorite Tom song.
My aunt (breast cancer) my grandma (melanoma stage 3) my mom (melanoma stage 4) .. the people in my life affected by cancer thank you Tom. Too many shits pure evil. More money to be made in treatment then curing it. Love ya guys keep up the grind
Your helping lots of people with this song Tom, Good man...
thank you Tom, having a rare form of kidney cancer this speaks so clearly to me
This is an amazing song tom i am a huge fan good luck in these hard times
Thank you so much for all you do Tom. This song truly is amazing! Being someone that comes from a family that cancer has beaten down, this is the most inspirational song I have ever heard and easily my favorite ever. So on behalf of myself, my siblings, and my mother, and even my children Thank you. You’re message is one the entire world needs to here.  F Cancer! HOG 4 Life!!!!
Wow this is awesome tom i love this bro, one love from nigeria 💙💙💙💙
Lost to damn many loved ones to cancer!
Having recently lost my auntie to cancer this song hits me on a different level. All I've got to say is that this is something more people need to listen to whom are going through that struggle. Keep fighting until your last moment, everyone love and believes in you❤️
Another 🔥🔥hit.
For once with Tom, I have to ask; how could you dislike this? This man is talking about people battling with cancer and not giving up. Those dislikes must be absolutely tragic individuals with no understanding of love and kindness.
Hit the nail square on the head with this one
Losing someone to cancer changes your view on the medical industry. Once you see the profit margins compared to the death toll rates. It’s undeniable that they make it about profit and not quality of life. Glad to hear someone say something about it that’s on a grander stage. Keep doing you Tom!
Snaps bro good song for sure.
I will keep fighting  Good song thanks
First 15 secs and it’s already powerful. Love you Tom.
You weren’t kidding when you said we would need tissues! Cancer took my Dad who I only had the pleasure of knowing for a few short years as I didn’t meet him until I was 21. Thank you for this song! As always you never disappoint!
Thanks Tom. Just had me crying my eyes out over my lunch
I love this. One of the hardest times of my life was battling cancer while going through a divorce. Tom feels life. Not many are like that.
Damn Tom you did it again
❤
😧 this hits home😧 thank you for sharing Tom❣️
This song just it home. My mom is fighting lung cancer now. She has been fighting for going on a year. Thank you Tom for this song.
My dad died of stage four lung cancer. A lot of people on his side of the family have died from it. Glad to have heard this song and I'll be looking back on it if I ever get it. Great job 🤘
Lost my dad to cancer.. Was a fucked fight. Love your friends and family. Make as many memories you can.
Absolutely love the new song!
My dad passed from brain cancer January 2019 this song hit me hard
Amazing bro! Just amazing! Feels, Chills and goosebumps! Everything you say is so raw and real! I love it
Who just opened the flood gate from my face....  Damn Son....
Fuck, wasn't expecting this, u right we all got tears in our eyes. Fuckin lovin it,lost my Mam to cancer, she was my best friend RIP love yah Mam 💞💞💞
I just found out my grandma has cancer this really helps
Positive message in a sad subject
My mom actually did have cancer, it sort of hits deep when I think back on it. But thank god she is still alive.
Tom. That was one of the most heartfelt songs I've ever heard. As someone who has been beside and taken care of multiple parents having cancer and losing the battle that this song gave me hope. I hope that it will help someone else like it has me. Thank you tom.
😭🤗😊💪🤟💜🎶💞everything u said was right on point  and  so true.....we are fighters.....💪💜...thank u Tom ...u say all the words and feelings that I seem to not get  out....your music helps so much....
🇺🇸💯🌊🐬⚓🐧
Its population  control
Gorgeous and heartbreaking
It's about damn time someone said all of this!
Dammit Tom. Got me choking up at work! I love you man! This song is amazing dawg.
he said on insta it'll make me shed a tear i didn't want to believe it but damn tom you were right
Good song
Thank you for this song! I have nothing but respect for you. Keep your head up. Much Love.
Nice song
Bro ur a legend I had so many people I know that die from cancer
love this MR. MacDonald, thank you. we have lost many of our fire fighter on our dept from cancer over the last few years. one engine is names after one of those fire fighter(sandy), her name is painted on the engine along with her ribbon for the cancer she had. Im on duty today and wearing my pink shirt. I have a daughter who has mitochondrial disease. we have found out through the foundation that hen these companies get the research money,  the research stays in house, it doesnt get shared. the UMDF is trying to get through congress that all research is shared by everyone no matter what disease they have. so people are not doing the same research and  something that didnt work for one disease may for for another. I hope this goes through. If mito is cured, it will crew a lot of other diseases as well.
even if you don't like the song you better not dislike this the message is amazing
good job i love it
WOW  Absolutely beautiful
Beautiful Brotha ✊🏼
Amazing as always and the message can be said basically for anything we have to go through in life.
This song is gonna help millions giving them strength ✊❤️💯. Much love to you Tom❤️🤞
I love this. Your such an amazing artist
this is something diffrent and i love it
Ironically my dad passed from cancer around this time. The day before Halloween. 😭
This is why I fucking love Tom Macdonald
I love this song.  Had two grandparents pass away from cancer
Dude. Its coming up on the anniversary of my cousin dying to cancer. This song hit me hard, man.
Damn
As a 32 yr old that was diagnosed this year thank you.
How are people gonna diss this bro wtf
Damnit Tom!  I'm crying...
Thank you Tom. My dad passed away this year from stage 4 lung cancer. He was the strongest man i knew. Survived vietnam, came back, made a family and lived his life. Im 29 years old. My dad passed on at 74. Thank you tom. I hope you read this.
Thank you man I needed to hear this.
This is the best song youve ever done its not often a grown man makes me cry thank you for this song rip Bruce White HOG
Damn! On fire man. Exactly the way I feel and think about it all, big up to you for allways speaking the truth man.
Not true I want to die this world became shit.  Btw I do like this song good job Tom
New fan here. I have just recently discovered your music and I have got to say it's fire 🔥  subscribed and following. Keep em coming.
You're awesome bro😊
Baffles me a bit that Tom supports Trump who is planning to remove all those pesky regulations for the EPA and FDA that would help reduce cancer risk... regulations protect citizens from risk. We need more. There’s a reason most food additives are allowed here yet banned elsewhere.
For anyone who has lost someone from cancer im sorry for your loss i can't imagine how painful it is
Your mom, your dad, and your sister stand inside a room. Someone wont survive it, Do you hope it isnt you... I have lost so much already to cancer in my family and now my sister is battling stage 4 colon cancer that has spread. She has been the strongest woman I have ever known through it all. Thanks for making this for them bro! They are fighters! Much love! #HOGFOREVER
You have an amazing gift w your songs and music I love listening because it's so true and relatable. Keep on doing you Tom H.O.G. 4 LIFE
I hated it as soon as I seen the title. 40 seconds in I changed my mind pretty good
Thank you tom. This is real. Prayers go out to everyone in the world fighting or who has fought this cancer.
Badass
I cried. I’ve been fighting since I was 9 years old and I’ve lost my dad, aunt, and grandmother all to the same cancer. Thank you for this video. We are warriors!
Ithank you.
This song right here going tears down my eyes this is one of the toughest songs I can't hold back my tears I know a lot of people that died of cancer fuck cancer I love this song Tom everybody got to hear this  I'm going to share the hell out of it everything😢😢😢😭😭😭
I'm trying not to cry. Damn it...
❤💔💖😪💜
Thank you for this and God bless you this means a lot to so many people you've touched more than just one heart with this I hope you know that and I hope you understand that you have built a family that loves and supports you Tom McDonald great work keep doing it we all love you
Thanks Tom for this song we just found out my dad has stage 4 stomach cancer Thursday he is fighting for his life he is a trooper this affects a lot of people
I'm a 2 time cancer survivor! Unfortunately my cancer is a rare one. I will fight it until it finally gets me. This song reminds me and the many others to stay strong and to keep fighting. Thank you for taking the time and all the great efforts into making this awesome song.
Check out Mickey’s fight. book and Brittany’sbattle.org
AMAZING JOB TOM MACDONALD. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE MAN. KEEP UP THE AMAZING WORK 🙏... GOD BLESS EVERYONE
My wife was just diagnosed with brain cancer in july. She has seizures in her sleep one night and had to be rushed to the hospital. That's how we found out. We just got married 2 years ago after being together for 13. The Dr said she couldn't have babies but it happened and our little girl will be 2 in july. Fingers crossed that radiation she starts next week kills whatever is left from her surgery.
All I can say to you is THANK YOU for this song! After loosing my dad this summer and my mother in law 3 summers ago to lung cancer and now my daughters best friends mom is fighting the exact same battle me and my daughter needed to hear this. THANK YOU!
There is no money in a cure Tom. Thanks for this song mate.
This hit me hard and made me tear up.. I survived Cancer of the blood  15years Cancer free.
This song is amazing, thank you for your powerful word, I am very close to this song, It hits home for me... Thank you once again Tom your amazing you and Nova both... Love you keep doing what you do best!
Thank you great song!
Driving home from work as this dropped but had to listen right away. Now I got tears remembering everyone in my life that didn’t win there fight. I did not sign up for this level of feels when I became a part of the HOG. Keep it up Tom!
Just cried my heart out..  thanku  for using your  platform  to help others. ..this was amazing. .thanku  Tom thanku  Nova  much love an God bless everyone  x
Thank You! I’m a Warrior currently in the fight for my life!
I'm going to watch it when I get home because the cafeteria is loud
There's no money in cures,  like you said there refusing to make it. they'll cure you if your important enough and have the cash. That's why some of the most evil people live so long.
Thank you for being brave and standing up for those who are suffering in one way or another. You bring strength to those who are feeling weak.
I just lost my mom last week to lung and bone cancer and you drop this song. Thank you Tom. I wish she could have heard this. R. I. P. Mom 8/3/1960 - 10/5/2020.
Loved this song.   I had cancer 30 years ago and obviously beat it but made friends during my 6 month stay at the hospital that died.  Its sad.    This song brought tears to my eyes.
The clock above the girl   said 420. I love your music tom.
❤️
Tom this song hits home , I lost my mother , her 2 sisters and her brother to colon cancer. Her other sister died of cervical cancer. This all happened in a matter of 5 years.
A beautiful song for a sad subject. I pray it helps many.
Thank you for this Tom this will help me and others like me fight this monster, much love man!
Thanks for this, Tom! Got out of the Navy  in April and was supposed to switch to the Army under an 11X option 40 contract and instead felt like getting diagnosed with cancer on July 6th before I shipped out was a better plan.
This is beautiful, Tom! Thank you. ❤️❤️❤️
Song goes harder than most.
Only forgiven people get to Heaven. Good news Salvation is a free gift. Ephesians 2:8-9 it's not by being good least anyone should boast... Listen to Steve Cioccolanti, James Tour, John Lennox, Jacob Prasch, Ravi Zacharias... Historically, Archaeologically and Eschatologically the Bible is concrete. If it wasn't, there would be no hope...

Thank you for everything you do!!!!! Real talk 💯  👏 🙌
Amen
Thank you so much for this song ❤️
You did it again Tom !!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😭😭
Love it
I love this song I listened to it with my disks I bought honestly
My grandma had terminal cancer and we're not sure she'll make it to Christmas. This song was amazing
Lost my mom and dad to cancer. My dad was 55. I'm 50 now I hope I out live him.
Wow.. That hits you right in the feels this Friday morning. Thank you. Great song. Keep it up.
We've all been touched by the devil's disease and the devil medical profit machine.. this is fuckin' beautiful and so true man. The only one's going to hell are the ones profiting off this horrible disease instead of curing it. And Imo and the shit I've seen and experienced in my life so far, let em burn. 🔥
Think your makeup job was a little off haha
Wow that's deep good job Tom !! That hit my feels good dude
Damn this song hits home so much. At any time now my grandfather is going to pass from cancer. Hes done chemo treatment twice and after the second time he decided he doesnt want to go through that anymore. I know they have a cure but they wanna keep us sick. It's crazy how you never hear about the important politicians getting cancer because if they do get it I'm sure they receive a cure for it.
Liked & shared! 💚
Thank you Tom and Nova
Damn Tom thank you. Keep at it. Sending positivity and prayer out to us. I'm sending it back your way. Thank you I needed this. I don't have cancer but I did just get out of the hospital. I will keep fighting! HOG FOR LIFE!
They have the cure. But they wont let go of the pharmaceutical 'stry. Too much money going in. We're taught to die the day we're born. Taught to fear asking for help but being forced to go into debt to stop the fear or told No because we're " a waste of money". Humanity is holding on by a fraying thread that keeps getting bullied by quick flames and scissors. Humanity is dying and the higher ups everyone looks to to keep their heads above water is now holding their hands over our heads to drown us. We are stronger as a people than the government ever was. But that's a taboo secret we're taught to deny because all good dogs do what they're told when they're told because the shelter is not a place for a new home. Its societies bullets, electricity, injections, judgement and hate putting humanity down one lost and scared dog at a time.  Welcome to the world guys, where confusion and deceit are part of life and everyone's fucking terrified.  -Jett
This song is so beautiful, and needed! It’s going to help so many, to stay strong and fight hard! Tom, I don’t care what anyone has to say about you negatively, you are what this world needs! SOME ONE WHO ISN’T SCARED TO STAND FOR OTHERS AND SPEAKS NOTHING BUT TRUTH!
F Cancer 💪🏻
(sorry for kiss spells tearing up) My grampaw g passed from cancer agent orange. He passed when I turned 18 and it was like he kept holding on until he felt I was ready for him to go home...love u poppop miss u everyday for 5 years... 😖  Be strong everyone. Tom macdonald makes music to help people if one doesn't realize it... Love yah tom. Thank you for keeping me on this planet with your music 💚
Keep doing what you do man
My sister went through chemo for years and years. Relapsed twice by the time she was 5 years old, and passed a couple weeks after she turned 6. We were fortunate to be able to have a princess party for her before she passed. She wanted to just be like you and me, and she fought for it every day.   Thank you Tom, I won't ever forget my sister ❤❤
How in the hell could 1 person give this a thumbs down let alone 27. That's sorry as hell. Great job Tom continuing to show diversity in your talent and skill set. Keep up the great music!

Thank you so much Tom... My grandmas birthday was two days ago and it's been rough on me and my grandpa. She was fighting pancreatic cancer for over 3 years and was only supposed to make it 3-6 months. This reminded me of her and how much of a fighter she was. Thank you so much for this amazing new song I'll forever remember my grandma hearing this amazing beautiful song.
Tom I love you and nova but you probably would of had better luck making me cry (again) with a video for the song that actually made me cry,  Naz.  Love this video but listening to you break up in Naz just about made me crash my car cause I was bumping flowers for the dead in my car when I first heard that song and it hella got to me. Shit, writing about it and remembering it is wrecking me.  Keep moving forward bro YOU got this!
Love you Tom ❤️
My mother had cancer in her stomach, and it was scary 'cause it was growing for years and no one ever guessed that, even with signs, cancer would be something she had. Thank God she survived, we were all so scared and some of us just went numb, we didn't know how to feel. I prayed with dedication for the time she had it, I'd cry at night before sleeping, it was scary and having to play strong and not cry when getting the news was difficult. I have two younger brothers and I didn't want them to be scared. I just thank God she beat it and she got the surgery to remove the organ it was affecting in her stomach. Thank you Tom.
Thank you bubba for this. I've lost 4 family members do to cancer.
Thank you Tom. I'm so thankful for all the songs you make. You are so passionate and really make your fans feel your songs. You don't just listen to your music ..you experience it. Much love❤️
This is a powerful message. My Grandma and a few others in my family have died from Cancer so this hit me hard.
My mother passed of cancer when I was 13! It was the worst long drawn out painful situation I have ever been in! I remember every terrifying step. I was too young man SHE WAS TOO YOUNG!
Awesome and amazing this is gonna touch a lot of people #HOGFORLIFE
Wow! Excellent..love it. Thank you Tom and Nova.  Bless you.
This hit home, hard.  Lost my little cousin last year to cancer
I was 9 when I helped my mom take care of her brother. He came back from Nam with a habit... AIDS... Remember  boys and girls, cancer comes from anything.
You are truly the master of lyrics, more people need to hear you

Damn, shit is deep 👏👏👏 love it tho
Getting checked in two weeks. Got me with that praying ya dont have it line.
You're a Great person!
I can already see Fountain Fanta guy hating on that. Won't say his name so I won't advertise his content in any way :D
Love this song man, it hits really hard my father is going threw brain cancer
One of the best artists I've ever seen... you're inspire me a lot and I really love that you have no shame to speak the truth even not that you know what happened to people who did it already...   Keep going what you doing and stay yourself brother!!!   Sending a lot respect Peace love and Harmony from Germany 🇩🇪 ❤   Hope you'll come around one day
Only Tom Macdonald song I can actually get behind.
Everyone, search “antineoplastons” in an unbiased search engine. You will find that there is a polish doctor that has a clinic in Texas that you can go to too receive treatment and the succuss rate is almost 100% the FDA blocked national clinics and the doctor spent millions fighting them in the 80’s-90’s.  PIN THIS TOM!!
My sister was born deaf and at the age 25 has no hair now due to cancer. This song is amazing
My eyes are welling up. Hits home for so many. Thank you, Tom. Sending lots of thoughts and much love to you all.
Just WOW... New record, this one had me in tears within the first 45 seconds
This is a good song. https://youtu.be/poyqB_DEqWo
This one definitely made me tear up. Thank you for your great music!!
My brother was a big fan of yours. We lost him to cancer last year. He had his leg amputated back in 2018 and seemed to be doing fine afterwards but it came back and infected his lungs the following year. He was the strongest person I ever knew. No matter what kind of shit life threw at him he always remained positive. I'm sure he would've loved to hear this.
We've got your back! We're here for you! Dont give up we know you're strong! ❤💚💛💜💙🖤💪💪
I've got to get 2/3 of my right lung removed from a tumor. Spent 3 months in a hospital already, and the first thing I joked about was "it's only cancer if it was covid I probably would have died"
Bro thank you 😭❤
Tha k you brother for this song. Lost so my parents to cancers.... Sister in remission from leukemia. Sister in law in remission from a cancer. Countless others so close to me. This song speaks volumes. God bless
Wow just when I find out I have this sometimes I'm so tired but I'll fight
RIP Susan Diane Hayes....4 years gone from brain cancer but forever in our hearts 💗. GOD bless and bring peace to all going thru this 🤴🌬️🌈🙏. Thank you for speaking truth on the"industries" attacking us 💯🔥
Thanks for this brother. My dad was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in January. The chemo is taking a toll on him but he keeps on fighting.
Cancer is a billion dollar industry, FDA wouldnt think of puttingboutva cure, they look at it as a moneyvmakervan population control. This is why it cracks me up that ppl still trust their govt
A mother figure of mine someone who has been in my life for 20 plus years has been diagnosed with cancer. This song kind of made me cry
Smoke weed everyday and eat RSO.
Damn man nothing but truth here
FUCK CANCER ... Today is my Lil sisters birthday--- she passed away from Cancer a few years ago... I needed this one bro ..! Thanks Tom....

You’re a legend Tom 🙏❤️
I'm not crying your crying...
My little brother just passed from complications due to cancer in September 2020. He was a fighter. Thanks for making this Tom. You're right, I did cry...
I love this, even though I did tear up. Another great song Tom.
Six years ago my father in  law had to get 30 radiation treatments for cancer. They cost $10,000 each and that was just for the treatment. He had tons of medical bills on top of that. Why would they cure cancer when they are making that kind of money? BTW, the radiation caused a stroke and gave him a different form of cancer that is incurable.
You never cease to amaze me Tom.  Thank you for touching this very touching issue.  Much love and respect to you.
Radiation is more dangerous than cancer is. My step mother had cancer and almost died from the radiation.
Lovely, certainly hits the spot.
Dam very deep💔😔
Thanks Tom! Much love! Rip Dad ❣💔🤬
Yep 👀 s watering. Have friends that have been there. Prayers for all that are battling this. Awesome TM

Definitely needed this! Dealing with kidney cancer myself. Always living in anxiety and fear.
Thank you for this video. Im getting a double mastectomy on Tuesday. I have the gene mutation for breast cancer. That cancer took my mom 11 years ago. I have a 40% chance of getting it. So im going to get this surgery to prevent the cancer. Its scary but I am a fighter. Thank you.
Scene at 2:56 hit hard
My sister has stomach cancer she gets so sick and weak from chemo they recently took her off chemo and put her on canbis treatment to try to shrink it but we'll see what happens they make her meds so expensive she's going in debt just trying to stay alive long enough to see her kids graduate from high school brakes my heart

Tom you hit home with this, I lost my mom to cancer as well as a lot of relatives and it needs to be said that with the amount of money the cancer society has been given you would think they would have a cure by now, it’s a Billion dollar Industry  #FUCK CANCER
Tom, good job!

💯 RESPECT !
wow Tom!!!
Thanks for this I needed to hear something been fighting for 3 years now
Yup, had leukemia. Blood cancer. It's not quite true though, people are fighting hard ti cure it. 20 years ago, mine was a death sentence, all they could do was make you comfortable. Now, its one of the most easily treatable forms of leukemia there is. The doctors, nurses and researchers are real heroes. And a big "thank you" from me to Pfizer corp, they paid for my tretinoin treatments for me when I couldn't.
Great song 💜
why are you shitting on the doctors though? They will use every method they know to try to cure you, that's the only thing they can do.
Wow. Keep Fighting. Your all beautiful to me!
Great Job!
This is gonna help me pull through my cancer, the words are literally perfect. There’s not enough people in the world who truly care like you do. Thank you 🙏 #HOG
Best bro ,you are all time best,love you from Nepal
Tom, man your music is some of the best and your messages are on point! It has helped me through plenty of dark spells and gives me enjoyment everyday. As a cancer survivor I've rocked this song many times. Hangover Gang for life!
I'm not crying, you are 🥺😢
Uploaded 2 minutes ago from when I viewed it and already almost 5k views!? Damn Tom, you're gonna kill the trending charts with this one, if youtube lets it on trending that is. They better. This was phenomenal.
Wow - just wow.  Another Anthem.
Never thought such a powerful message can be so fuckin cringeworthy....
You were right... tears.
What up!
Love this Tom!! Inspirational words and Facts about the scientific research, Big Pharma and health insurance companies ... Cancer really does touch all of us in one way or another. My mother had a mass removed which took part of her lower lung. Praying they got it all & next test is clear. 🙌 Much Love💗Love💗Love💗 #HOG #NovaRockafeller #111 #Familyst #GloatGangg #SwaggArmy  #SwaggFamily #MoGang #lyricalassassins
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My mother passed from cancer in 2001 when I was 12. Theres definitely a cure. Thanks for using your platform to say this
Tom Never disappoints. I have so much respect for him.

God bless! From the heart.❤
Liked the video before it started and this will help a lot of people. Thank you
As someone who has been left behind twice due to cancer taking the people I loved most thank you for this Tom. You showed the frustration, helplessness, courage in the face of terror, of the unknown. Thank you so much. You are a gift!
Really sad but its a good song.
Great song brother!!!
Best song ever Tom
Awesome vid! My mom liked it too (she had breast cancer).
This legit brought tears to my eyes 😢😢😢 THE BEST Rapper/ Musician i have ever listened to! Tom im lovin every vid you drop, please never stop! You inspire so many people to be more than they are and i hope you know this
Music with actually purpose!!
My aunt has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. My grandmother passed away from breast cancer but we never stop fighting it. Tom really thanks for this. This song is highly inspiring for us to keep fighting. Thank you.
"We been paying  them to kill ourselves" sounds right
Lost both parents to cancer - from the bottom of my heart ty bro
Thank you Tom for this,  you are a true inspiration to all of your fans.
You were right Tom. That one got me
Im crying. Idc
What happened to the F in the songs name? That's not a very Tom thing to do.  Great song tho
Thanks Tom.  I've been dealing with brain cancer since 2013.  I've had 2 brain surgeries, the first left me paralyzed for a while but I gained most of my feeling and movement back.  Was told they got it all just to find out 3 yrs later it came back.  So had the second surgery and chemotherapy and radiation.  Now they say I'm in remission but I definitely am not the same person I once was.  I try to stay positive but I can't do things I used to be able to do with my kids.  And it kills me how much I see it affects them.
You have the spirit of Christ within you and your candor is being true to who you are and living life to the fullest and not worrying about other people’s judgement because that’s Gods job. God bless you! Your music is beautiful and awesome and inspiring!!!!!!
👍
I miss you dad 🥰
Yoo tom McDonald  Nice music video 😇👍 respect. for life bro.. HOG for ever

My wife had cancer she was diagnosed with it on November 2019 she had surgery on December lost one of her ovary but then with couple weeks she was called again and said that the cancer was able to spread to her uterus and her other ovary. It kills me cause she always sad and all her emotions are confusing and Now I won’t know what a feeling of a father feels like I lost my little girls (twins) 6 years ago in a car accident my wife was 7 months pregnant 😢 so that’s what’s hurts me more this song is nice thanks Tom Macdonald

Thank you so much for making this video now I can share it
Beautiful song!
Cancer took dad in 2016, moms fighting through 2nd round of chemo. Hell has reserved seats for those that hide the cure.
Dude this is beautiful, and u were right, I honestly shed a tear  #hangovergang
This song hits home with me. I've lost a few family members to cancer. My Aunt passed away and my grandpa passed away from cancer. My mom was lucky enough to survive it but still had to go through chemo. Thank you so much for making this song Tom.
Your sicknesses are big business.
One of my best friends past away earlier this year due to cancer. The doctors did surgery and chemo and said the cancer was 100% gone...one month after surgery they said it came back and it took his life in 3 weeks... thank you Tom! This song was amazing and is going to help a lot of people, I know my friend would have enjoyed it! Much love! HOG for life!
My mom had cancer 4 times this really hit me hard.
True facts bro llllooooooovvvvvveeeeee u bro
Tom, you really had me with this song! I am working in a hospital at the labs and it drives me crazy like everyone is bitching about the china-virus. People are still sick, like really sick but they all have to wait in line becaus all our attention is on corona.
Dude been a fan for awhile september 3 2015 I had my left kidney removed due to small cell carcinoma stage 2 kidney cancer. This song will shed light on shit most don't know about.
True art from a true artist. Thank you!
Sending out prayers to everyone fighting cancer
Thank you Tom
Loooovvveeee this song!
This hit hard man, I’m crying right now thank you for this song
Holy shit man, that just hit me. Wasn't expecting such a powerful message in such a video. Tom, thank you from all of the people everywhere for being such an inspiration to humans everywhere.
I lost my brother 3 years ago to cancer when he was 42 years old. That was the day I learned what "worst day ever" really meant. From then on I have not complained about what's wrong, I have solved the problems.  I quit smoking, drugs, and drinking. Still smoke weed, but even that's less.   Wow, look at me sharing! Tom, you're bringing us together. That's magic in this day and age of thought control. Thanks 👍  If I'm honest I expected an anti-feminist song. But this was good bro.
Built a business on addictions 💯
Powerful.
This hits home for so many, thank you Tom. ❤ love this!
Who else was continuously refreshing to see it asap 😂😂
Lifes short we can only live and enjoy it while we have it
Sad but true tom much love tom
13 years ago cancer looked me in the face and said "bet I can make you die".I took the bet. Check out my avatar.
My dad wasn’t really in my life but he had like 4 different cancers and idk how he got through them all, he’s gone now from an OD. After having cancer multiple times and surviving for him to just pass to an OD. This world is a mess rn.
There is a cure for cancer it's a pill and this song is amazing man keep up the work 😭😱🥺
My dad past from cancer a few years ago he fought it three times and the last one ended up being terminal. Cancer blows. Thank you for this song
Why are people disliking this video? 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️

Another amazing one! I love this song
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💯❤️🔥
😢😢😢 Shit man, I don't know what to say except this is fucking 💔💔💔 but will inspire and give strength to so many that need it.  THANK YOU
Well, Tom was right. I cried. I couldn't imagine going through this world without hope of what comes after. After years of struggling, I trust the sacrifice Jesus made to bring an undeserving sinner like me into Heaven. I use to overcomplicate it but salvation is simple. Know you are a sinner and trust Jesus to save you from Hell. This is what I believe and I share it out of love, all glory goes to God.
I loveeeee it.... & yes they have a cure...its in seeds in other countries that aren't as polluted as our land. I just came out of the opioid epidemic after 18fg years and detoxed & the numbers of death by that is more then soliders that died in WW2🤦‍♀️😪💔....CANCER IS A WEAPON AND AS THE GREAT CHRIS ROCK SD..."THERE IS NO MONEY IN THE CURE...THE MONEY IS IN THE COME BACK"...All drug dealers know that...ESPECIALLY BIG PHARM🤦‍♀️🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳⏳BUT BEAUTIFUL SONG AS ALWAYS LOVED IT#HOG 4EVERRRRR🖤🎼🎶🎵
God bless everyone and their families
Thank you Tom great video of Adam saying it for years they have a cure for cancer they just don’t want you to know because big Pharma would lose a lot of money
God this hits so close to home. No one deserves to die from this disease and no on deserves to go through the pain of it either on both sides(patient or family)
Great song tom
Nice
I forget that he's canadian
Just whooped Hodgkins Lymphoma ass twice, 1st time I went into remission for 6 months, then it came back and with stem cell transplant and more chemo I’m completely cured now
Thankyou Tom MacDonald this song hit me in the feels both my dad and my auntie (his sister) died at 61yrs old due to cancer and watching my dad fight the battle was the hardest time I've ever had to be strong for. Cancer sucks and the big pharmaceutical companies will never release the cure as they make too much from treatment. This one made me cry like a baby. Thankyou for keeping it real brother 💯
AMAZING!!!! Had me tearin up though cuz I lost my mom over 10 years ago to metastatic breast cancer. I also just lost one of my great aunts to pancratic cancer on Oct 6th. I have lost so many to cancer in my life. It's hard but we get through it. Definitely gonna help people with this song. You guys ROCK!!!!
Ugh this made me cry! 😭😭😭
Great song man. There are cures out there but they are making a bunch of money on not curing it they will never make the cures known. I know one of them. It helped my wife and a buddy of mine. Its a root you make into tea
The mother of my 4 kids has stage 4 cervical. Its a very hard battle.Thank you for this tom.🥺
This hit me hard. I watched my little cousin at a yr old loose all her hair to chemo when she was 1
ty...fridays are hard foR me now b/c i lost my precious father on a friday(2108) to pancreatic cancer...LOVE THIS!
This song is beautiful and pulls at my heart strings in ways that words cannot describe.
Tom I love you
Beautiful. 😍💜  (I'm a Cancer (water sign) too. 😃✌️🏻)
Everyone who has said to have found a cure to cancer has been assassinated in the past, it’s a sad world we live in.
Another masterpiece from The legend
The devil most hated word ever he hates to hear & it turns hom away from people even demons got weak & leave , they can’t be arround any mankind who recites this verse (Allah! There is no god but He - the Living, the Self-subsisting, Eternal. No slumber can seize Him nor Sleep. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. Who is there can intercede in His presence except as he permitteth? He knoweth what (appeareth to His creatures As) Before or After or Behind them. Nor shall they compass aught of His knowledge except as He willeth. His throne doth extend over the heavens and on earth, and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them, For He is the Most High, the Supreme (in glory).
I brother past away almost 7 years ago from cancer E.J. Brownie ❤

One of my friends has cancer and has been going through chemo and all of that mess. It's really knocked her down hard. This song hit close to home and I'm definitely sending her this now.❤

Tom and Nova, Wow! Powerful song. As always love you both. Thank you for always being You!!!
I'm one of the first people to comment on this and I was one of the first people there was 21 people it's a great song tom macdonald
❤❤❤ Thank you for showing the struggle of cancer patients and their loved ones! I'm an Oncology nurse and deal with this on a daily basis.  It can be so heart breaking, but the fighting spirit in most patients is amazing!!
Hmmm
Thank you Tom I think you're a very underestimated person God bless you keep it coming
I watched a reaction to this song that didn't have the video. I really liked the song . The video completely connects you.
Lost my sister last year to cancer. Thank you for this.
The man does it AGAIN!!!!!Tom,brother,if you see this comment,take it to heart.Don't ever regret anything you did in the past.Your life and all you have done has given you the power to touch people in a way that no one else can.
This hits home ❤️ My grandpa and dad both passed away from cancer 17days apart from each other. I have family members fighting now. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You did it again bro. Nailed it. Much love guys!  HOG forever and ever 🧡
Such a powerful song bro, this song and video will touch so many 🤘🏻
I shared and marked it as an anthem to those battling because it is a song that I feel inspires one to survive and find the inner strength. GREAT song Tom! 👏👏👏
In the process right now. Just got a biopsy done on my lymph node yesterday because the doctor believes it's lymphoma. A really dark time. Just the thoughts have me super exhausted. This song hit a spot, dropped a few tears.
This one hit home in more than one way. Thank you Tom MacDonald! Hangover gang for life!
Wow 😭
Nice job guys!!! Careful with that Hope though we aren’t supposed to have that FEAR FEAR FEAR CONTROL CONTROL CONTROL!!!!
This song really touches the heart. I love you Grandma. Thank you Tom

Love this
We will fight to a cure my great grandmother had cancer and most likely my replacement grandfather does to we don't know yet but I'm praying
I'm speechless, it bought tears to my eyes. I support and love each  person having to fight this battle! Thank you Tom it's gonna help many people!!❤
NUMBER 7,238
😪😪😪Tom this was so true. So many thoughts and emotions that we do battle with when faced with these horrible tragedies. Thank you for saying it out loud! My Dad died of Lung Cancer in 2014 and he chose not to have treatment bc of money that would leave his family broke and in debt and that was with insurance. The few months he had left he didn’t want to be sick but instead spend those days and enjoy the time he had left with his family. That was so hard for us to accept but all we could do is respect his decision. Thank you. HOG FOREVER
Awesome! Sorry to anyone that goes thru this, knock on wood my family has been blessed.
Love this guy he’s awesome speaks the truth
Tom and Nova you guys are awesome !
My grandma is still suffering from the after effects of kemo therapy and another of other family members threw out the years with the battle this song hit my hear strings thanks tom
It's funny that there are probably people who are subscribed to Tom just waiting for a new video to drop so they can smack that dislike button. Talk about rent free.
You're just the best 💜 love how you speak the truth unlike all the rest conning everyone into being trapped in the system 🙌🏼 keep at it Tom, keep waking the masses, I bet your music is responsible for sending many down the 🐰🕳️ much love to you and Nova 🤍🌹
Great and true lyrics Tom, you're at your best! After I heard the song on CD I was wondering what the video was gonna be like, great work Nova! Keep up this amazing teamwork, you guys f*ck*ng rock! #hangovergang4life
Here 1.2k have watched
My mom went through breast cancer just 3 years ago its always a scary thought that the cancer will spread and it just gets worse... but she's now fully recovered and cancer free :D
i like how he thinks
I hope people actually listen too the lyrics...our whole system is basically built on people killing each other for their personal gain😪😪😪
Dang it Tom. ok you win. I teared up. Great song and video. Good job to you and Nova.
This song brought tears to my eyes. I know the song is about cancer but it hits on so many different levels. Thank you.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This one hit home.
I wonder what inspired him. What's the story behind this song? I kind of assume someone close to him just received a diagnosis... People usually don't start thinking about cancer until it hits home.
Thank you ever so wholeheartedly Tom for this track. Not knowing how this track hits home for me on such a personal level... My mother lost her battle to cancer a year ago this week. This track has has given me that one more breath in life... Thanks bro
THANK YOU  It’s your BEST song LOVE the chorus
Gave me cold chills Thanks 🙏 for this Tom... You are an amazing artist.. much love to you brother
Who else on this planet making music for Cancer patients, no one. Tom Macdonald is though.
Bravo!
Woah that a  great song n vidéo 👍✌️
Been listening to this non stop on the new album, and you guys killed the video 100%
“The good night go to heaven, The bad might go to hell” This is what many people believe but let me just tell you it’s not true. Whoever accepts Jesus as their Lord and Savior will receive eternal life. It has nothing to do with being a good or bad person. I know that’s hard to believe because why would we want to be good people if we know we’re going to heaven. Well when you give your life to Christ then you’ll  want to do good because the Holy Spirit is in you and will change the desires of your heart. Awesome song bro God bless 🙏🏻
This song is beautiful 😍
Hey man, i can't tell you how much i've been looking forward to this release and.. Tell the truth? It gave me goosebumps..  My dad died back in 2000 of lung cancer. I was like 8. I had asthma at the time, but it's fine now. I did sports, but i stopped. I smoke now. Like.. A lot. Im overweight and im trying to keep myself motivated. Im scared i may get sick of this, just like my dad. Im not scared of dying as much as leaving my moms all alone on this world.. I know she wouldn't stay.. But this f-in word keeps coming up in my head and it scarea me to death.  This song though?.. It might just be the cure man. I promise to always listen to this when im afraid or i feel unmotivated. I love you man, im so glad to have found you.  Keep being you and living the way you want. Those that respect it will always be behind you. Bear.  H O G BABY!
Yea it sucks they got these hospitals in Oklahoma most advance in usa but you gotta have lots of money to go there
Wow! I got chills. Thanks for that song. Personal and touched home for me right now.
Great video Tom!  Your songs always hit home and are so full of life, truth and real emotion.  Thanks for sharing something amazing!
Tom out here making another emotional banger 🤘🏽
Facts!
Holy shitt wow and amazing for real bro tear jerker for sure. Can we get this TRENDING H O G FOR REAL let's go.
My wife just hand her thyroid cancer removed.  Scary shit.
♥ prayers for all
This video hit deep. I couldn’t begin to imagine what I would feel if I found out one of my kids was diagnosed and fighting cancer.
😭😭😭 This one hit me so hard, Tom. Lost my mom to that beast in 2012. She was 55. My father and I laid on either side of her as she took her last breath. She was my everything, my best friend. My first 2 children barely got any time with her and my 3rd never met her. You said everything I feel and think. ❤
This is a terrible song
Thank you for this I am hitting my 5th year in remission from renal cancer and am drowned in a sea of medical debt but I am so thankful I made it through it and now I hope it never returns
Definetely holding my child a little harder tonight!
Tom when u die u go to hell unless u ask to go to heaven its not good goes to heaven and bad goes to hell its "Ask and u shall receive" straight from the Bible and the Bible is written by man inspired by God. You have a choose all u gotta do is ask.
You both have wonderful souls believe that!
Lost my mom last year to this shit
Thanks man, appreciate you for real. needed to hear this.
To all with health issues. I hope that the good days out weight the bad. Just because your having a bad day doesn't mean you alone. The struggle isn't only you that pain is shared. Doesn't mean stop smiling though.
8 yrs ago my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer. The treatment gave her a stroke that killed her. 6 months after her diagnosis she was gone.
Thank you, Tom 🖤
My dad fought Throat cancer 2 years ago and won. Fuck cancer.
Damn
The only people disliking this video are the doctors profiting from cancer “research”.
Wow probably the best thing I've heard yet and I love all of it.   More people  need to record truth like this thank you Tom.
Its amazing how lost Tom has gotten. This was a song that he wouldve done a great job at 5 years ago. Now its so obvious hes trying so hard to be relatable that he makes a song about something he doesnt have to deal with just for clicks and instead of actually relating to people dealing with it. This is about losing someone. Not some dumb conspiracy about treatment.....fuck you tom this is a dumb dumb song
Bro this dropped on the same day my aunt was just told she has six months cause lung cancer keep her in your prayers y'all. Update just showed this to my mom its her sister and she loved it thank u tom u made her day with this one.
Great fuckin job man!
Man I don't know what to say.
Tom, Thank You
My mom has stage 4 small cell lung cancer this shit hits hard
This song hits hard with me, my mom went through the battle with breast cancer this past year. It was a crazy hard road, she will never be completely free but it’s dormant and for that I am thankful!  Keep fighting y’all!!
Thank you Tom for this God Bless You
Ok yea I need to go grab some toilet paper because that for me in the feels 🤧😪 F Cancer - also I cannot wait to stream this in Spotify 🤘
You weren't wrong... I am crying.
I wasn't expecting anything like this from you. I have cancer right now.. Thank you.
Is the doctor the Sam guy who played the teacher in white boy
Hey Tom, not sure if you'll read this but I'll post it anyway. Do you think you can start adding captions to your videos? It would really help for people who couldn't understand a verse because of how fast you're rapping
no worse feeling than leaving my autistic/asperger's son behind with a broke down truck and 3000 in my debts.
Oh man did you ever make me cry!  I watched the cancer eat away at my grandmother and the chemo destroyed her. Breast Cancer. Thank you Tom for bringing a light in the darkness.
Cancer 🗑️
:( cant watch sad Tom this ealry in the morning but will click like  ;( no sad tom!!
Thank you bro!!! I've lost several family members and I'm a survivor myself....this hits home hard like I know it will for many.
Song is amazing and inspiring!!  Thank you Tom!!   My son was diagnosed at 15 with leukemia.  One of the worst moments in my life. He went through treatment for 2 1/2 yrs.  Thankfully he  survived and is now 35 with 5 kids.  Cancer sucks!!My prayers are with all those battling and their families..Stay strong!!
Wow😥
Quit worshiping lucifer because he is so weak , ayo tom Believe my guy im a fan i f with yo music it touches a lot but let me tell you that lucifer once admitted that this (Allah! There is no god but He - the Living, the Self-subsisting, Eternal. No slumber can seize Him nor Sleep. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. Who is there can intercede in His presence except as he permitteth? He knoweth what (appeareth to His creatures As) Before or After or Behind them. Nor shall they compass aught of His knowledge except as He willeth. His throne doth extend over the heavens and on earth, and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them, For He is the Most High, the Supreme (in glory).burns him & turn him away from you for a whole day , its a war my guy 🙏
Beautiful
Amazing as always
Good stuff man. Keeping us sick is the biggest business there is.
I love the message, but I can only listen to this song one time, it almost had me in tears, too sad to listen to every day
I won't pretend that this is something that can be cured easily, but I do wish that there was something more that could be done. Something that wasn't basically fighting something deadly with something deadly... but it's a beautiful song and one that I hope many people will be able to listen to, to help them gain just a little more strength in their battle.
Aint no other artist do it like you do and most never will great song bro 💯
Completely right sobbing like a baby. Loved it 🖤🖤🖤
Love this! SCIENCE AND HEALTH written by Mary Baker Eddy ...First published in 1875 is phenomenal in helpful recovery. Gratitude of you bringing Awareness of TRUTH you amazing Artistic geniuses! Tom McDonald and Nova!!
Like all of your songs tom # hangover gang love you all
Damn Tom...this one literally has me tearing up
cancer rates are high because of the inland above ground nuclear testing the U.S. government did before 1962, so not only is it a billion dollar industry that they can't afford to end, but they created the need for it in the first place.
TOM IM YOUR NUBER ONE FAN
Really good song!
Im not crying your crying
Amazing 🙏🏼🙏🏼
Yes
Beautiful song Tom, love your music. I hope that if you are reading this and either battling cancer or know someone that is, that they win that fight.
Lost a lot of friends and love ones to cancer. Thanks for this tom. HOG life 🤟
I dont know what kind of person would actually dislike this song. Thank you for making this song Tom.
Bro.... this made me tear up a bit. Good song Tom. Gonna share this now.
Great fight song! Thank you! 🌹❤️
Hell yeah
OMG Tom this is an amazing song I LOVE IT!!! especially since I've lost my mom to cancer and a few friends. It sucks I hate cancer.!!!
This is the one Tom. This is it
Apparently there have been a lot of cures over the course of the last 50 years but the Governments are acting all weird tryin to cover em up
Yes Healthcare is a problem
Tears, thank you , Tom!
Amazing as always man. Recently learned about you and have become a huge fan. You do what you want and speak on what you want. God Bless you for that.
The dislikes are from people that lost family or friends to cancer and got butthurt with this song full of truth
That's a great one, Tom! I lost my brother, mom, and dad to cancer. This one hits home.
Been listening to you for a couple of years now and didn't expect a song on this topic to drop. This is not to say you haven't made tracks on non-mainstream rap topics before but cancer is one that can bring us all together. You're a real one for this. Thanks. HOG
Like I've said before men don't ever stop doing what you're doing you bring the light to every life
This song is amazing.
Wow!! Amazing!! As a SURVIVOR this hit home to me! God bless you! I love your music more and more everyday. You are a truth behind all the ugly veil of lies. Keep it up!!!
My nan died from cancer least year . Thx u for this tom
Amazing!!!
Love this! I lost my uncle to prostate cancer in 2019 he fought hard . This song made me think of him ❤️😭
Well he said that we would cry
Thx for this as a fighter it hits home but its soo true im a fighter !! Thx for another great song as always !!
It takes a lot to get me to cry but Tom did
I bet the cure is in area f1. Goverment only want to cure the people with billions and dont want to help the people who are goin through stuff. And the government just pollutes all of our stuff just for the money cuz they just selfish punks. My uncle and grandpa just died from it so i know for a 100% that i will get it so thank u very much for the faith boost. 😊😊
Both of my parents passed on from cancer. You did a very good job on the song
Nail on the head yet again.
I'm a survivor and so are a few of my friends from childhood. Thanks Tom. Cancer Sucks.
“I have told you these things so that in Me you may have peace. You will have suffering in this world. Be courageous! I have conquered the world.”” ‭‭John‬ ‭16:33‬ ‭   Once you realize who is sovereign you will have no fear
Man this song hit home my grandpa passed away a year ago after a almost 4 years and it seems like everyone just excepted it and moved on shit hurts man 😭
I absolutely love this! Your an amazing artist. Dont ever quit. All of you with cancer, FIGHT everyone has a special reason to be here! You are ALL amazing!! 💙💙
Hi
Tom's always out here speaking the truth
3 years now my father passed away from cancer. This song hits hard in my heart. My father fought hard but lost the battle.
Love this, thank u. This hits home. Love how the clock says 4:20pm haha 😄
Thank you for this song. My grandma survived 2 different breast cancers and lymphoma all at the same time. She fought for 8 years and is in remission. However, my uncle was just diagnosed with stage 3 glioblastoma it’s in his brain behind his eye and he won’t survive it.  #fuckcancer
Man that song touched me I have lost many people to cancer. My brother has it now and just found out my wife’s mom has lung cancer. Really loved this song. Thank you....
Love it
I love it. I lost my grandma to cancer in 04 and she was my world. The anniversary of her passing is the 1st and it hurts every day still
Holy shit 😭😭😭
Amazing song and video.
And I am crying. I don't have cancer but 4 heart surgeries and 4 other surgeries and 2 years and they make more problems. It makes no sense whatsoever. So keep being real. You inspire more people than you'll ever know!
IM  SOOOO BLOWN AWAY  WITH  THIS ... ..YOU  PUT IN A LOT OF WORK  ON THIS  VIDEO  .. RESPECT  TO YOU AND YA  MISSES
Beautiful song, beautiful message, just like Sober. Thank you for making this. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I've known many who lived thru cancer, and know a few that have lost the fight. It's hard on the family and friends to watch their loved ones fight. It's not an easy fight. So many complications, so much could go wrong, and there is no sure bet that the treatment plan they make for one person will work on another. May people bolster themselves from listening to your words. May the see their own strength is stronger than they thought and continue the fight. And to those currently in the fight: stay strong, keep fighting. We're here for you.  I wanted to add - I lost my grandpa to Stage 4 lung cancer back in 2016. We didn't know. I had an inkling, but respected his silence. We believe he probably knew it back in the late 90's, but refused treatment. But we'll never know for sure. We just had 2 weeks to learn the truth, and say our byes to him, instead of suffering for possibly 2 decades wondering when the day would come, and dealing with the aftereffects of the treatment.
Damn, good one bro. Fuckin hell I really miss my dad, at least I was there to hold his hand
😭😭damn it bro shits to deep for me today I lost my grandmother who fought and beat that cancer twice but all those meds she suffered from Alzheimer’s and passed after ten years of  remission from the cancer
So many truths in that song. Lost my grandmother 7 years ago to lung cancer. I still miss her every day. Keep up the great work Tom.
Hi
😭😭😭😭
My wife lost her mother to colon cancer 3 years ago after a 4 year fight.... she was the most kind and beautiful I knew aside from my own mother. This song just made me bawl my eyes out. It hurt, but it also helped
My mom has cancer. This song means so much! Tom you're absolutely my favorite rapper ever! Keep it up!
Wow man... wow... Thank you
I love how people subscribe just to be able to dislike the video yet....subscribing does more to help than a dislike does to hurt. People are so godamn stupid
Great vid Tom and Nova!!! Once AGAIN!!❤❤🙏🙏 I already shared to FB!! I sent y'all a poem in PM see if you can finish it! It was written around 1987-88 TY I love all y'alls work!! Keep rocking!!
Thank you for this song tom my dad is going trow cancer stage 4 lung cancer he's not much time left here on Earth. So I say thank you for the song for all the people going trow the cancer right now
This shit made me cry man, every generation of males in my family have had heart disease and pancreatic cancer and have all passed shortly after seeking treatment. I’ve got a wife, 3 little girls and a whole life to live and it’s because of the example set by those who came before that I’ve elected to thus far live in blissful ignorance.
First song that’s brought a tear to my eye in a long time
Love it Tom!
Who has. Cancer
bravo
Amazing
I can't stop crying!! Your music is amazing!!
You're right when you said that we were going to cry my wife lost her uncle two cancer almost two years ago now her dad has it I don't know what to do I don't know how to deal
Lost my dad to liver cancer in 2015 and shit ain’t been the same since but gotta keep on keepin on !!! Doctors told him he’d live 5 months. He made it 11 months with no treatments. Fuck the system. They know exactly what to do to stop it but making the $ and allowing ppl to die is more important!
I just love all the emotion and passion you put into your songs. Keep on keeping on Tom. ❤
You speak the truth💯💯.loved you and Nova since the beginning 💜🖤💞🥰😍
I love everything about this song.. the lyrics, video, passion.. I hope you're doing ok, and everyone near and dear to you. You're a fighter. Stay strong Tom ♡
Powerful
My mom had breast cancer, I'm glad she's still here to see her grand kids grow up!!
I’m not crying, you’re crying 😭
FIRE~!~~~~~~~~~
This song hit me like a bus. Tom knows how to hit the feels
I love this song Tom McDonald it sounds very very amazing 🙏
Truthful.. sad.  Love it.. thank you Tom
Badass song bro. The meaning behind it carries weight. Songs like this is why you can't be stopped. Keep speaking the truth no matter what. Someone is always willing to lend and ear to you man.
Damn... all the feels in this
Damn that made me emotional..awesome song...but then they always r...I'm gunna go play this song to my cousin..she is fighting Ovarian Cancer..ty
My mother was misdiagnosed & died because of it. I know there's a cure.
Speaking the truth all facts another banger 🔥 keep it going tom
Beautiful song man
I lost dad and grandpa to lung cancer, my mothers had skin cancer 3 times and there's a chance I have a form of cancer...but I'm honestly to terrified to ask the dr.
My dad has cancer currently... This song brought me to tears. Thank you Tom for everything you do. I really mean it.
Thousands of views in seconds..... Your gone bro!!!!
Tom! I just want to say your an inspiration and your songs have helped me reflect on myself and I'm doing my little bit to help out make the world just a bit less shit.  I've got the new albums and they are great! I'm glad I got to know you through your music!   I'm spreading Hang over Gang shit through my friends and they love it too! Keep it up man your changing lives
Thank you for this. I just lost an Uncle to a 2 year cancer battle 3 days ago. This hit me hard....
A Beautiful song Thank you
I absolutely love this song and its message. This song is going to touch hearts and strengthen souls and help people get through treatment. Thank sooooo much tom macdonald and nova Rockefeller ❤
Keep it Tom , Special Place in Heaven for people who speak the Truth and make people feel good and not alone and do not spread hate instead of LOVE . So many of your songs have made me feel better after listening to .
Tom McDonald  your one great artist you aren't afraid to say what you need to say instead of rappers focused on a high or a drug or female when will there be more artists like you again this is hardcore gangster rap according to Tupac
Yo he be rapping about real life stuff I'm a new fam
Welp Tom you were correct I bawled my eyes out! Losing loved ones to cancer is awful but so is loosing someone from something naturally. But this is beautifully made and just wonderful. I love it as always!!!
If you put a thumbs down to this you can just go to hell...beautiful song
This is a awesome song, GOD BLESS you Tom and Nova
Oh my Tom! This will touch so many people who have been touched by cancer. Thank you for this!
Only put In the best way by the best!!!😌
You are never going to convince me that the mass influx of absolute shit for you to eat, drink, clean with, etc., wasn't purposeful. Somethings got to change. Governments all over the world are irradiating the oceans, the ground, and the air, and when our planet is no longer liveable, the same people irradiating the planet are the ones who are going to be leaving.
Imagine disliking this video...like really what is wrong with you
😢😢 🔥
This song is one everyone needs to hear. Lost both my father last year and my grandmother this year to cancer. This songs gives hope even if it's just a little bit. Thank you Tom!
Great song mate and so true as usual
Tom, this was hard to watch, but that's what makes it great. My dad died from cancer... this brings back all the memories and emotions - good and bad.  Thank you.
Going through it now.. Thank you Tom
There’s a young girl in my town who is currently battling and The Whole town and towns around are supporting.

Lost my granddaughter to cancer, and my brother is fighting it now. Hits in the feels.
Wow this one just made me tear up... You really are the realest artist i have ever seen... I love all your song they get me through the day. My mom has MS and i just played this to her and we both started crying. I just want to say thank jou tom. Thank you🙏🙏🙏
My bestfriend just passed from cancer. His chemo treatments weren't helping and the morphine made his blood toxic. Literally diagnosed then dead 4 months later. It started in his pancreas and move to his bone marrow, ended up in his brain. R.I.P tuggs
🥰😢
Damn my grandma has breast cancer nd this really hit different thx man
My husband is my rockstar! He had throat cancer. He's been in remission for 3 years now. Thank you God! May God bless anyone dealing with this awful disease and give you strength, courage and comfort. It's something that affects the whole family. Just stay positive and keep fighting!
No words just wow very few songs bring me to tears this is now 2 of yours that has made me cry like a spanked kid. I wish being the other one.
Thank you! Means alot!
My dad has cancer and he is the hardest working and strongest man I’ve ever met. Idk how he does it but I’m literally watching him go through radiation and I can see how much it is affecting his body. Radiation is killing him. I just wish I could live up to the man he is but I can’t. Thank you for this song. I’m crying, wishing I was half the man he is
Tom, keep pumping out these songs that you do. Send those messages.
Well done Tom, we lost my mother in law 3 years ago to breast cancer
Facts 💯
This song rn will help a lot of people at the age of 6  my sister was diagnosed with brain cancer I was 12 years old when I found out she had brain cancer
Dam bro you are the man done a hell of a job on this one an i hope to one day meet you.
I'm speechless beautiful song bro
Good song... but please tell me that the actress didn't actually cut her hair for this video! They just capped it, right?
Look at these haters!!! All they do is wait for him to post the video and immediately hit dislike without watching the video! The haters have issues!
The song is very good it is the truth they have cure they're not going to let you have it
this is the official "Tom has helped me through it" button
It's a money game. The cure was found in the early 20's but it was quickly hushed in order to line the pockets of big Pharma and the elites. They always play money games with our lives. Aids has been cured. Look at Magic Johnson
Is gud
Amazing job Tom, as always!
My sis in law  has cancer. She is now doing an experimental  chemo treatment.  It's her last hope. This song  is for her.
Legend!
I love this song before I even see the music video this hit so deep
Well Tom you did it again ❤️❤️ 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
You are my hero Tom, not only because your music is awesome, and relatable, but because you teach people that they can overcome anything and you root for them

火🔥火🔥火🔥火🔥火🔥火🔥火🔥火
Love it man! Lost lots of family to cancer, including Mom and Dad.
When I want to end my my life, I think about someone with cancer and I think to myself they wanna live they don't wanna die.. So I pick myself up a nd keep pushing I tell myself someone with cancer would trade spots with you in a second, keep going. 💞💞💞 to anyone out there with anxiety, depression, ocd, cancer or anything else that puts them In a fear all the time, you are stronger than you think, you don't know your body's true limits and even when you are done. Get back up cause you have one life don't waste it, go live it 😁😇
Keep speaking the truth bro and putting put amazing music.
Thank you bro. Runs rampant in my family. This time last year my baby sister got breast cancer, half way through fighting it the chemo caused 15 tumors in her brain and caused brain cancer. Still pushing cause we aren't quitters. I avoid the doc, im the only one in my bloodline without anything. Yet. Love you
Beautiful song
❤❤❤❤

Beautiful song Tom. Your words have so much  meaning and truth behind them. It's almost too much to fathom how open your eyes are to the struggles and pains we ALL feel. As always Keep on, Keeping on. Much love, H.O.G Family 4 life!

This song really hits home for me I lost my mamaw to ovarian cancer not a day goes by that I don't think about her
This song hits hard and deep.  Tom, you are a poet.  You breathe the thoughts and emotions of so many of us, and validate so many feelings and thoughts for so many of us.  Thank you for this, and everything else you do.
True to life sir
Fantastic as always.. You and nova never disappoint.. 👍
You were right about the tears.  Perfect video for this song.  Thank you Tom! ❤️
Damn I’m kinda early but all these other fans are hella early hahah.  Haven’t even watched video yet but already dropped a like.
You've got more strength then you know! 🔥🔥🔥 Tom. You inspire many and many more to come.
Can someone please tell me why we live in a nation where our democratic politicians deemed transgender priority over cancer patients? Edit: to clarify, I’m referring to medical billing/coverage and costs.
I never clicked so fast!! Love you Tom!!!!!
This might just  be my new favorite song of yours Tom. You consistently keep surprising me because it seems every song you make is just better and better never taking steps back. God bless and hope you and Nova are staying sane in this chaotic year we call 2020
Thank you Tom  for this but damn you got me in my feels. I love this side of you.
My dude Tom always pulling someone heartstrings keep up the good work my g
That hit the soft spot in my heart tom. I can't express the appreciation for you enough sir!! Thank you for blessing us with amazing music for our ear bringing awareness to things no one else does 🙏🙏🙏
Nope. Not gonna do it. Nope no no. Damn 😭
Woooww good video bro and message....
I’m predicting this will hit high on trending before sun down.
Man this one hits different I know so many close friends who have or had cancer
Wow, I've listened to this song a lot, but the video... wow, just wow!
There is a cure but they'll never let it go. It's more profitable to keep us sick.
You gave me chills once again. This better trend 🙂
I beat it twice already Once when I was 13 and again when I was 31
Beautifully done.  Live life to the fullest.
OMG AMAZING Tom MacDonald NEVER stop doing what you do. Your truths and your heart are such a blessing
Amazing. Great song. You just helped alot of people get through their day.
In tears right now as cancer has hit my family very closely and I have increase chances of getting it. It pushes me to live my life the way I want to Because it all could end in a second

What a wholesome video.  Respect my man 🙏
Another incredible message. Thank you.

Awesome video brotha
Talk about inspiration
Lost my mom to cancer & hiv Thanks for this tom!
Best video yet! Definitely most heart wrenching!!! God bless!
Oh man,  this is going to touch a lot of people!
Also im first
You should do a video like you did with Wish.  Have people that have been touched by cancer holding a sign with her name and a lighter or a match or a candle.
Tom is amazing. Every popular artist today except him (that I know of) got popular with a deal. Or a company.    Tom did it himself. Crazy.
Cancer is man made and they have the cure but theres more money to be made treating a kid with cancer than to heal one sad world we live in
I've beaten cancer in 2018 and can Just say 1 Thing: keep it up and never loose Hope. Great Song ❤️
I lost my mom to cancer. It is so sad they won't cure it.
A couple people in my family have or had cancer so this is real talk. 👍
This hit close to home thank you

Amazing
good stuff Tom man. I can see you growing as a person and a man.
If Steve Jobs died from cancer There’s no cure
Bro... Thank you!
I like that there was comments saying the song is good and fire a few seconds after the upload   Most times you need to hear a song to know if it’s good
I've been waiting for this 😁 Fun fact smoking is the leading cause of premature death. There is a cure Tom, it's called Ban 🚬
Love it.
I Have An Uncureable Lung Disease And A Brain Tumor It Sucks But I Have To Keep Fighting Everyday. Toms Music Helps Me Get My Mind Off Of Things.
I wish my dad could of been saved from cancer. But the cancer was to strong for him. I miss him so much. F*** CANCER!!!
My mom passed away 6 years ago. I was 18, and I’m still not over it.
Absolutely love this.
Like always your amazing brother
Tom I love u Man U a goat!!! Ur music is the best keep it up!!! 🔥🔥🔥
I’m 23 I had cancer 5 years ago. Made me senior year of school rough. Have Lost 2 grandparents to it as well in the last 3 years. Chemo is hell. It’s not only a strain on your body but it breaks you down mentally as well. I don’t wish it on anyone.
This one's deep Brother, love it !!
This was really heartfelt I love it, an awesome uplifting anthem for those struggling
Everyone stay safe 🥺
How will someone dislike this?
Love your music it helps alot
Best wishes to fighters ❤
❤️
Damn Tom .... Fucking deep bro. Great message young man. Love it homie!
We know there is a cure but “they” won’t use it.. no cap.
Thank you
Love it💕💕💕
One thing that helps is to have faith ask God to come in your heart and live the best that you can live
This shows how much Tom cares about the world
This is so real and woke. I been talking about this to so many people, why would big pharma cure something when "treating it" makes them so much cash
❤❤❤
Its not about curing people of cancer because a customer cured is a customer lost! *ITS ABOUT ENRICHING BIG PHARMA* These people don't care about you!
Welp now I am crying. Thank you Tom 🙏🏼
Real man telling real fact pulling me out of a whole I’m locked in
Wow my wife's mom died from lung cancer at 49 wqy to young  wish I could have met her had to be an amazing woman and would have loved to thank her for rasing such an amazing daughter r.i.p. me there in law
I love you 😘 Thank You Tom ❣️
This song means alot thank you for making this. HOG 4LIFE
Wasn’t ready the deep ness in this one.
It’s about time we stand up to big pharma! Good job Tom
Mr lyrics Mr Fact Factory Evil people are the one leading us but  in this world there's someone for everyone Tom McDonald is for us who want to know more about the world evil doers
Blessings
This song is like castle's it's for everyone, everyone one has it in their genes, so true
A little sign of light in these time of eternal dark! Keep up the good work and keep telling it how it is!
this song touches my heart because i lost my grandmother a year ago due to cancer. they said since she was 60 she wasnt going to be moved up and there were more important and i had to lose her infront of me. my hand was holding hers the moment she passed so Tom thank you for making this.
Of course as soon as my dad's going through all this cancer you had to come out with the song....thank u
This hits different
Facts love it
Thank you Tom for making beautiful music only 1 1/2 minutes in, moving song my guy

STRAIGHT FIRE YOUR A GOOD MAN TOM KEEP IT UP PLEASE YOU A VERY GREAT MAN
This shit hits home as cancer stole many family members, my uncle was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Thank you Tom. You got me in the heart yet again.
I’m dutch and cancer is a very common swear word. It’s also the leading death cause. The thing is, I remember many family members dying of it, and I still use the word. Basically we use the worst thing we can imagine to swear with.
I always drop a like before watching 💯♥️
This hits close to home!! Good job!!!! 👍👍
You and Nova were right.....I'm crying big *man-tears now......
Damn man such a powerful song brother! Great job

Song really hit home.  Mom has stage 4 cancer and been living with it for thr past year and a half. Shes been struggling  to find where to put her faith.keep up the good work Tom.
I lost my grandmother to cancer a while back and it kills me thinking about it bc there is no way they don’t have a cure for it yet. We can clone animals but not cure one of the biggest illnesses?!?
Goosebumps man. Keep telling the truth!
This song gives me goose bumps it is amazing
Now it's all about the covid, they forgot about the rest...

Thank you for this song. Powerful. I had goosebumps the whole time. I heard this song a few days ago on a mini road trip with family. I won't go into too much details with a son story but this got home for my family. 💛
A guy in the 40s or 60 made a cure and dissapeared a couple of days later
Damn I had 3 people in my family that passed because of cancer, thank you for this Tom
I honestly love what I'm hearing already, and having some experience with this kind of stuff it's better to fight than to just give up, keep up the amazing work tom, absolutely love you and your work

Let’s see what fire Tom spits here
Its all about money tom, if someone finds a cure for cancer, the large corporations buy it out and bury it for one purpose... its meant to have them put through chemo and other scans or whatnot and bill you for the rest of your life.
Happy friday!
