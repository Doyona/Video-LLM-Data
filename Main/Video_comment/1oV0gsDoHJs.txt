*72 HOURS ONLY!!!!* >>> THEBOYS.STORE <<< GET IT NOW!!!
I don wan eat diz
15:30  'hey throw some over here' dude throws foreskin at him
Coming back and reading all these comments like "remember when max wasn't vegetarian and would eat anything". Like he wasnt talking about being veggie on his channel before he even met George. Being vegetarian doesn't keep him from eating his own vomit, some people gotta get their heads checked lmao.
The Mexican food was so bad there was even an exorcism that took place
3:36-0,4:52-0,7:46-53,9:32-50😂,10:22-24,14:50-0
I can’t watch with the thing with painted nails
i thought they would ne drinking :(
oh fuck i had forgotten about the lettuce shortage
I'm having human cake flashbacks
Oh and it was like growing up with jackass again but your all my age 😂 so I'll wait till your burt Reynolds geriatric in age to try to meet yall at a con ❤ thanks for getting grog to FL can you guys get in ABC liquor stores? There is one everywhere in southern Florida!
How could max say to far 😂 he literally made his career as a fan boy throwing up on Chad and ean lol and eating hair cakes 😂or lighting donkey Chong on fire ❤ never regret these things man these memories we will carry with us always love you guys miss papa franku😢
IS THAT MAX FUCKING MOEFOE(cold ones because)!!!?? COLLABING WITH THE BOYS!!!? I love this collab y’all are the best   (Also love from America)
9:10 you want a tomato vegetarian boy 😂😂😂😂😂
If Eddie opened up an authentic Mexican restaurant in Australia he'd be making stacks
Funny how the vegan eats potato cakes soaked in MEAT JUICES, GTFOH😂😂😂😂😂😂
Max literally eats corn the long way.
Guys if you don’t say your username you can’t get into the giveaway you have to say your usernane
21:37       e a t   i t
i love you too
These videos are always relaxing to listen too through the years
The amount of nasty max and chad eat they put on a piss poor showing here
1:19 they should have said shit shop
26:50 I didn't know @thecityboys were there in the background.
throw back to mully and bbno$ and josh
I'm so late to this video but man I fuckin love mushrooms. I could eat a whole bowl of sauted mushrooms with just some salt and pepper.
3:52 WTF😂😂😂
Bring the cold ones back on the channel. Mac is so sexy.
30:10
This is hilarious the amount of lettuce recalls America has had and they’re making fun of Australia lmao
5:42 Did everyone saw that narrator didn’t even take a bite
Max being vegetarian but tried the burger bread which is soaked in meat oil and put on the pan where meat has been and then eating the chips that are cooked along with the fish 😂😅😅😂 my mate used to work there so i knew 😂 there were so many more in the video i could explain 😂 had me feeling so bad was shouting at the tv like nooooooooooo😮  I was in legit tears watching this 😂😂😂😂
Fact, they spent 16 minutes on one restaurant
I’m a fan of the content good shit, but honestly I don’t understand how you can keep a straight face when there’s a dude with painted nails
Bring the hoodie out again its so tuff
Juicy looks like Johnny joestar
11:48 I actually gagged
Gay !?
Maxmoefoe with the boys !!!!!!😮
You guys are pansies
Burrito 🌯 isn't Mexican, tacos are rhe star of Mexicans.  Tacos are Mexican burritos are somewhat American but are originally Arabic.  They call curious shwarmas . So tacos are Mexican and swarmas (bureitos] are arab
22:23 sounds like something max would do 😭
Why are their nails painted ?
Isn't it dim sum
I'm not being mean but I hate vegans
max is way more chill and hot than mulley(?)
You guys gave two of the people that made the human cake trilogy pause. Let that sink in.
Narrator is such a baby when it comes to food bro haha
@14:40 if max was a fortune teller he could have put it in his other pocket and started “left pocket dog $hit” IHAVENOTHING
28:55
No sounds like  "Nohe" Not "Neiwrighere" Your Canadian neighbor 😉
Max He’s sounds like adult rekid
16:57 ❤
11:49 😅😅😂😂😊😊
remember when dudes wer all painting their nails like idiots ahaha 2 years ago aged like milk
Saw the vegetarian. Didn't want to hear complaining so clicked out.
Don’t know why but this video made me want some beef stew
11:54
8:54 it’s a gyro they tend to not be rapped fully
11:51
11:37
I think max got ptsd from the cakes joji made him eat
I eat roasted peanut with rice 🤣🤣🤣
Them: “Dont order and your mom will die” Me: doesnt order and my mom dies  (This was a while ago i just noticed when rewatching)
i like how they called a greek gyro a wrap LMFAO
I saw two narrators but one of them have a beard
I feel like it wasn’t actually that bad ya know they just played it way up bc they were expecting worse
Burritos are Mexican American, same with hard-shell tacos
Guess I’m poor cause I’m not buying any of your overpriced merch man haha 😂
Idk why max looks so grossed out he literally ate hair cake before
This is embarrassing for men 😮 painted nails how cringe wtf is wrong with people ? Guys getting nail treatments 😂 ... Love the content and max but how creepy are these guys becoming 😳
I cant believe mully ate the squid that chad was chewing on...fuck sake man
Get a tripod and I'll watch it
narrator face 15:50
Me trying to eat and watch this was a bad idea
Me trying to eat and watch this was a bad idea
How am I a year late to this?
Im not a Mexican but im a Mexican food expert because I've eaten a lot of it in the past. That food looks all wrong . Im so lucky to have the best Mexican restaurant near me. I dont like bell peppers or tomatoes typically. But they cook it so well I crave it.
I've seen straighter gay qorn
21:59 the way narrator says Quac got me rolling 😂
Bro gotta calm down with the camera shaking and zooms
One of my favorite collabs on yt
15:20 lmao
For a vegan, Max seems to like Eddie's meat a bit too much 22:20
8 min into this video and i feel like i've watched more ads than video
do i have your word that my mom will die if i buy this shirt?
I'm mexican and I approve this message
The one and only perk of being a vegan, you get to pass on nasty food challenges.
Bros order octopus.. Are shocked to receive octopus.
are Australians even capable of eating more than beans/toast, vegemite/toast and toast?
still funny how mully always says swallow, but he always spit out anything just a tiny bit gross. Team gay!!
10:14
Finally, Chip Orb.
7:51 EDDIES NAILS????💅💅💅💅
22:00 guaccc 😂
Please play “Have a nice death”
Bro wtf is this 16:58
Very disappointed by Narrator. Out of all the boys, he's the last one I thought would paint his nails.
Good thing I waited 5 years to watch this
That wrap is a souvlaki but discusting
meaning of champorado: its chocolate with rice in it, eddie said its like a dessert for Christmas, but in the Philippines we eat it everyday as breakfast or lunch
Mexican approved ✅
10/10
the painted nails make this video gay
Whats the deal between Chad and Mully, first they share food, and then they are cuddling. Im not judging at all, just veeerryyy suprised.
Australians, better than the British worse than the Americans
Why is it like the avengers  autisticing for the first time.
Mully Eddie josh juicy narrator u love u all but im sorry Chad is barely tolerable and max is annoying i do not like them and i will never buy that hoddie u boys are genuinely 20 billion times better then them i don't mean to hate but id rather have a tinder date with an black market human trafficker.
17:40  by cheap they probably meant as in the meat and stuff in the burger is low quality
Narrator needs to start participating in everyone it’s getting pretty annoying, you were stationed in Germany. Time to stop acting like you were some hardass.
Why does every single Australian YouTuber know each other.
🍕 🍕 🍕
My names Max as well as
The way they VIOLATED the Gyro 😭✋had my heart crying
first time watching this boys channel you guys make chad and max look normal
Are dudes with fancy painted nails some kind of Australian thing?
FIRE ALARMS BATTERY
Chad is like mullys long lost brother 😂
That Mexican food looks like Greek food... But Greek food is actually good so that's just a whole different genre of food at that point
Slagga bagga Aussie slang makes my nuts tingle.😂😂😂😂
No wonder Max looks the way he does…
Mully is just harassing Max at this point!
Chad and Mully are so sweet together!
If you're ever trying to hit ketosis and you feel like you might break your fast watch this video. It got me through lmao
That sucked
The cold ones are boring asf. The only people who bring energy to this video are the boys
What is the point of narrator being in these? He doesn't try anything
If yall want good Mexican food outside of mexico come to Texas.
chad and mully bruhhh i love it
best youtube channel collab
“WHY THERE NO COB?!” I don’t know bro. I dont know😔
0:16 were are you talking about chad and max
Voiceover’s voice has worn thin
im super late to this now im a fan fml i would of copped that hoodie
I’ve lived in Mexico City and also Spain for many months out of the year for the past 6-7 years of my life and this guy is mad cause he try’s to act offended as if this food is anything from Mexico. He’s basically so far away he’s on the moon
I'm gross enough that I'd enjoy the food 😂
Chad should be the 6th member of the boys
I wanted the hoodie
FUCK THIS WAS A YEAR AGO
These guys let the intrusive thoughts win every time lmfao
Any guy who paints his nails opinion doesn’t matter
26:10 When the gang saw jackass 1 and yu  wanan make yur friend puke xd
Milky doing that made me laugh yet cringe and throw up at the same time 💀🤣
19:42 can we talk about how CHONKY that sour cream was
22:28 "they always accuse you of what they are doing."
Now we need to see them do a worst Uber eats with lazarbeam
juicy is gonna die from paper
Can I just say that those are comments about the restaurant Are years ago they could have changed on how they make stuff
this degraded theboys channel
So why is it that narrator cant stand seafood
U guys need to bring back that hoodie it to good for limited time only
"they probably put oil in the gravy too" Come on now chad.
13:02 Gravy😐
Gravy😐
The painted nails
Need the boys on cold ones
Fun fact, we aussies DID have a lettuce shortage, the half cabbage half lettuce mix was a real thing. Just in case there's doubters
I'm not gonna lie I was looking at that first burger and I would eat at least 4 of those rn
MULLY IS DISGUSTING
L
Are we gonna pretend we didn’t see Chad eat the paper with the gyro? lol
Chris trying to be a Mexican sounds like Adam Sandlers Zohan
My heart stopped beating 😊  for a while when you ate the octopus
If I could rate this 0 Stars I WOULD!!!
Why am I hungry now?!
the way Australians pronounce the words dim sum and Hyundai are equally short bus like and cringe. DIM SUM (SOME) fucking SUM, not SIM. jesus fuck.    Hyun Dai (HEE-YUN-DAY) not hi un daiya lmao.   even as an American I've not seen such hideous mispronunciation of very easy to say words.
welp my mum died what do you have to say for yourself
Why did I decide to watch this while eating 😐
i absolutely love the hispanic representation luv u very much eddy
Whenever this video pops up on my feed this thumbnail always gets me, with the weird limp wristed dude looking like a girl deep throating a Mexican corn… like wtf
I dont like the bandanna man but the rest of these guys really funny
First half made me wanna hurl, second half made me hard
mully is cheating on josh with chad DX im sad
Why is this video so lowly liked
11:16 bro Josh killed me  I laughed so hard
The cleaner going to kill themself 💀
America is coming for all that oil on Mully's face XD
thats a great collab because drinking a couple of cold ones with the boys
1:04 @mully uno reverse card
I have an extreme phobia of drains in any type of water. I also dont like water i cant see the bottom of. My time in the Marine Corp was often spent in various bodies of water so i can push that fear to the back of my mind. I can do that with drains as well if it were absolutely necessary. However, sitting and thinking of it makes me sick. The description of that food being in the bottom the sink was brutal. Im eating as i watch this. So gross. 😂
Why are y’all so gross?? Wtf
Narrator actually is the biggest scrublord.. How the fuck you gonna be scared of a dead fish but call yourself a cav scout?
23:21  Cause spinach is fuckin ass
18:40 he sounds like fake chinese accent not mexican
Anyone here in October 2023?
Wow great video! I hate everyone here except max and chad! Good job!
This video made me almost throw up about 15 times. 10/10
Had to stop watching after cringing so hard I got a cramp cause mully ate chewed up nasty octopus
i think narrator gets spoiled at home lol
Is max aware that him being vegetarian means he can still eat seafood.
I love dim Sims they all the best
I got so tired of "this isn't Mexican 🤓"
I love seafood ❤️
Narattor didnt eat the dimsin
are these guys gay?
SOMEONE GET CORNWOOD, THIS MAN JIST ATE CORN THE LONG WAY
Josh went straight for the bussy wrap and shot the after math out of his nose
yoo iz maxmoefoe
Quinoa black beans and spinach is crazy for a mexican burrito 😭😭😭  Ive only ever had pinto beans when it comes to my states (texas) type of mexican food
This is why men die sooner
the audible silence after every time the guy with the neon green beanie speaks
Is this guy actually vegetarian he be eating cheese
This video gives me vibes of a bunch of bad middle schoolers around a lunch table 😂
Dang. Saw this but My mom died a few years back. Feel like they cursed me from the future. Cheers to those without a mom. Hope those that don't know how it feels never have to know. 😆🍻
26:25 end cities in minecraft be like
Chad's "Mexican" sounds Asian 😂
Somehow the worst part is them being barefoot
Chads laugh is like nails on a chalkboard..just me?
I just took a bath, and I feel dirty just by watching this.
I dont understand narorator man had to eat mres but complains about food
why is mully gay with every male in this world
The best flavour of paper is the school paper with pencil marks
How do you know your gay....
You found my mom??
29:04 La oraćion de Eddie: En el nombre del padre el hijo y el Espíritu Santo! 🛐🙏
Oh god,the Australians are multiplying
This is the grossest video the boys have done
The fact Josh is so small he barely broke the table
26:26 When you kick a duck:
Omg was that @maxmofo
that vegetarian was kind of a beta boy....
Have you ever shitted so hard that you fell like your gun a barf? No just me? :(
27:41 dude what
Narrator needs to stop being a b When it comes to food Reviews. Why even show up. Do you think the guys like getting Tazed And shock Collard ?  No but they do it for the content You're not contributing if you're not doing any of the bits.
came back a few months later to tell you guys that florida ghost kitchen for mrbeast is now getting sued because of the quality of the burgers. so juicy did something 😂😂
Mully what can that mouth doo
I love narrator's expression when he said: WHY THERE'S NO COB!? that was hilarious
Eddie and Juicy with the matching nails
BRO THEY SAID MY NAME
This video made me hungry lol I had to pause to grab a snack
18:24 he had a German/Florida hippie accent
The way juicy says burger
Why these dudes paint their finger nails
Lmao the lunch table at school must have been crazy with these fucks
Gotta love peer pressure from the boys
Josh isn’t very funny
i hate this fake energy
Chad saying "IT'S NOT GOOD ESSE", made me hysterical
Now, do it again (Without Narrator)  this time.
25:08 THANK YOU  Its the same tortillas they serve at Taco Bell that white people love, its just eating a paper towel
burritos with quinoa and spinach? that's white hippie shit, not mexican food. no wonder australia lost a war with emu.
4:14 maxes scream omfggg haahahah
Never have I ever expected that anyone would out Cold ones energy "Cold ones"
How is Mully the most sanitary but at the same time the LEAST sanitary out of the Boys!? 😂😂
addie you good ?🤨 9:27
How are cold ones not part of the boys
Second restauranr have more oil on their food than america
That's what it's like when Amy Schumer squats over your face
max and chad please dont colab with them again.... this is as greedy as logan paule videos evry cut is an advertisement for the hoody cringe...
Chad an juicy great combo 😂
the perfect colab does not exi-
That Mexican guy makes me dislike Mexicans
Wow that Mexican guy is annoying
Narrator is the fuckin pukiest human I've ever seen lol
But my mom's already dead
your fcking AnimALS
I have hangover tummy and really want to drink some gravy right now 😢 Wish I didn't wait so long to watch thi
What a collab.  This works perfectly.
4:58 😅
I watched this and couldn't stand how "the boys" were acting . they have painted nails . They are all really rude and immature the whole time . They were disrespectful towards Max especially shoving non vegetarian food in his face . Max and Chad are to good for these people they are too immature . They don't eat vegetables like little kids
this has to be the most dangerous YouTube collab in history
22:06 that’s what good 😺 sound like 🤓
Australian Mexican food is shit
best unintentional out of focus I've ever seen @14:21
Why does ma floor line that in this?
ARE YOU GAY 🤣😂🤣
I love how 29:00 they have the chaotic blessing then at 30:00 literally 1 minute later josh gets thrown at a table
11:20 this man is a menace bro
i like how everyone said 0/10 then theres juicy saying im gonna swallow the head thought.
It's my first video and I could tell the Chinese ninja was Mexican because of the bullying level, then he said champurrado lmao
Juicys face when he was drinking the gravy was priceless 😭😂
Ngl making gaging noises while someone is actually about to throw up is so funny😂😂😂😂😂
“It’s a pocket pussy” got me dying
was going to watch this on my lunch break, but decided against that pretty quickly
21:42 neither is corn, bro doesn't even know his own culture, I usally don't care but it's not yours
Eddie barely ate, mully ate everything, narrator just keep hacking and coughing, max made a mess, chad ate everything, juicy just ate the paper and josh kept saying it sucked 😂
@10:22  that's a good answer
There’s no way they’re THAT bad
Please read my message you biatches
This is basically my lunch table at school
Bro please make more vids with cold ones 😭😭😭
Every time I watch these I can feel myself getting second hand food poisoning
12:04 😂 the mic cover
Ok let’s be honest juicy is literally a full ass toddler and I love him
When Chad was doing the Mexican accent he sounded more Asian than anything
One of these guys get Covid they all get cold
Isn't that bad or good cuz it depends where you order it cuz beast Burger isn't like made to taste the same every single time but like it depends are you order it at  bad cooking restaurant or not it's not going to taste bad all the time
11:59 bro I fucking gagged at this along with narrator
this is what i imagine ogres are like when they eat
w collab with maxmoefoe and chad
My man once ate human hair cake, I thought Chad could maybe suffer down an octopus or two
Max lookin like Steve brule
aint no way they confused a gyro for a wrap
You had me at cold ones
Anyone else watching this while eating and trying not to puke every time they gag?
the only person i would share food with is eddie
Seafood is the best food
21:01 🎉 you're welcome 🤗
I hate that I missed the merch.
NARRATOR IS SUCH A DRAMA QUEEN
Wait wait it’s boiling hot
Max being a vegetarian is wild, considering the shit he has eaten. Fucker literally ate a crayon in a recent cold ones episode yet wont eat meat.
10:08
“It’s like midget tossing” that line kills me😂😂
Probably not the best time to watch this while eating lol
I think it's funny. You can see the new YouTube edgy humor of the Boys and the old gen of Max and Chad a little clash. Max seems annoyed more than anything. And I think that's funny. Kind of a "been there don't that" kinda look.
Why was Mully so quiet near the end? Is he ok?
Max is me this entire video
11:48 why do women live longer than men you may ask?
Cold boys and the ones
Max clams to be vegan yet he eats dairy
I think The Boys and the Cold Ones should reunite and revisit the human cake.
Mully: "I FUCKIN HATE WHEN PEOPLE PLAY WITHT THEIR FOOD... IT MAKES ME ACTUALY PHYSICALLY SICK" Also Mully: "Spit it in my hand and let me try it"
💀 max and I are the same rn I couldn’t go through this whole vid without looking away and covering my mouth 😭 I was full on gagging
Hard to watch with how annoying everyone is. Besides max and Chad. They're content is great when they don't Collab
i love how blunt mully is😭
I love seafood which is good
The moment I realized they all don’t have shoes on😹
Dim sim😂😂
Together, they are called Crack the “Cold Ones” With “The Boys”
22:06
My mum didn’t die but she did shatter her leg and knee
The Amy Schumer joke... is the only thing that made me actually vomit while watching any of the boys videos. Thanks DubDick!
Some mexicans eat ants
I promise you I'll be the man to establish the Luke warm  ones
1:04 @mully      reverse card + block
Why does it feel like they've been friends since birth
Hey it’s the meat canyon merch guys
10:11 when the intrusive thoughts kick in
They boys are way more weird (in a good way) than those two. Hilarious
7:59 "ahlm-"
21:59
im watching this vid for the first time, my mom passed 10 days after this vid dropped. if only i bought the merch lol.
I like how max thinks all of the stuff is nasty when he literally eats glue
this is the most chaotic food review i have ever seen in my life this brings a smile to my face
I can tell what area they’re in just from the tag on the bin
I'm sorry but why was max even there, vegetarian and the food they are eating mostly meat. I hunt myself and that's the only meat we eat at my house.
Chads Mexican impression slowly turned into trey Parkers Asian impression
max wont eat this but he’ll literally drink glue….
Mully ruins the video
Bunch of gays
How did the blonde haired puss get so fat? He cries about everything and spits it all out and gags or pukes. What a fool.
I'm sorry its so funny how narrator always gags on stuff.
i want to see the boys eat the best rated food
that nigga muelly annoying
I dunno why but I'll always see Mully as the most disgusting one of the lads-
I'm guessing by the way Narrator reacts to different culture cousines that hes probably never had tried different foods other than Military food and American . Anyways , good video !
This is like the old generation meeting the new generation, it's fucking amazing
5:18 for the record- the red stuff is part of the filling, its not raw
Chads laugh tho 😂🤣
Fried octopus is god tier. Like the whole octopus. Goated
ahh, my dinner taste awesome while im watching this
I nearly threw up just watching this
This is the highschool table that mixes all the food
Mexican guy is so annoying
Am I wrong or was narrator not in the military? Shouldn’t he be able to eat pretty much anything by now 😂
0.53 seconds in the one guy from The Boys (sorry, am from Cold Ones) is speaking in normal volume  then Chad screaming AND IT'S A PATCH
Idk why but josh reminds me of blarg my shnoople
buddy has no place judging Mexican food. I bet his parents are from Ohio. Never in a thousand years would a "mexican" put Mayo on any traditional Mexican dish. HE'S A FRAUD
8:59 its a shwarma😂
"Dim Sum is the Australian take on a dumpling" is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard I'm dying
white guy only eats burgers i bet, idk why es on this show
Remember those days where Max ate a big sized krabby patty made by HowToBasic, sadly those times are over :(
not Eddie gets the worst rated Mexican food thinking it will be good
Well isnt this RICH.  max has LOST EVERYTHING that once made him a stand out savage.... y is he even in this video other then looking like hes about to cry AND SOOO UNCOMFORTABLE
This is like watching little kids react to any meal that’s not chips and nuggets. Gagging over a dim sim, oh please. 🤪
Very funny, but PLEASE show us the food next time, not just intensely shaky snapshots. Maybe like a 5 second spiraling cam up close so I can see the oily goodness.
I feel like every single one of them were those kids at the lunch table that used to mix all their food into one until someone dared them to eat it 💀
why is. NO ONE wearing socks or shoes
I relate to max on a spiritual level. Aside from the vegetarian bs. That shits gay.
this is 4months old and we in canada also sill had a lettuce shortage lmfao some places did not carry lettuce at all. but besides like lettuce for the big mac most places had none
Funny how they say it’s bad and Aus can’t make good Mexican food yet the video is them ordering from the worst places. What did you’s expect to happen 😂
Tripods exist guys. You don't need somone addicted to the zoom function and walking.
everytime they zoom in on eddies nails im like slay cause theyre so fuckin cute holy shit
Ohh!!!Champorado!!😃😃
Narrator eats the fish taco and starts singing korn
Make a shirt or hoodie that says cold boys
Again
Just spent 30 minutes of my life watching grown men play with food, im subscribed 👍🏼❤️
I don't like how comfortable they are. they act like they have been there for a while. 😐
pov the middle school boys lunch table rating the cafeteria food
Juicy was so jealous when eddie and What ever his dumb ass is named put there hands together AND HE HAD THE RIGHT TO BE !!!!!
27:41 "You're the only Mexico in Austrailia" killed me🤣
Juicy: *litterally jerks off the corn on the kob with the mayonaise* Also Juicy: too much mayo 20:59
I love Chad
I haven't gagged this much since human cake smh
Narrator: Why there no cob? 😂🤣
10:13 josh becomes a duck      Josh:Oh…Food Food Food? FOOOD
Drinking game: take a shot every time narrator gags
i have never watched anyone more funnier than the boys
Introducing a massive legend (Chad) and a massive pussy (Max)
does anyone know the first commetson the food were in 6 years ago 15 YEARS AGO AND 8 YEARS AGO
I love how these comments are so old
I don't see how people are vegan with good food like I bet you try it he be like mmmmmm
Nice bite Narrator 5:43 😂😂😂
I can’t watch another video with eating with milky 😂🤮
First video i watched with the Boys. i like em.
Why does narrator look like a cat coughing up a hair ball when he gags?
When he faked the Spanish accent it sounded more French
Bro the new jackass crew is lit LMAO
I think the boys are gay
They killed a fucking octopus for that... one of the most intelligent creatures...
How can Chad do a Mexican accent better than an American accent?
The Mexican food part was enough to make a Mexican bawl their eyes out 😭😭😭
Man, I regret not getting that hoodie when it came out. I didn't know who The Boys were so I didn't grab it. This video introduced me to them and well I was hooked. Ive seen many of their videos and not gonna lie they are a entertaining group. I hope they have another collab soon, and if they release another hoodie I'll be sure to grab one this time.
Ok dude in the headband is annoying
Watching this I wanted to puke
we get it.  Youre Mexican.
Eddie is on his own 😔 POOR eddie
Eddie eating hair, juicy eating paper, and mully drinking the oil from that burger but Narrator crying over a burrito and wont do seafood lol  WHACK!!
The cold ones: dim sim   Asians: ITS DIM SUM Me: *dying of laughter*
WE NEED! More cold ones with the boys this was the best video I watched in a long time yall make me happy
ngl my school lunch ladies can cook better than that-
21:00.
16:58
Vegetarian? That’s pretty gay bro.
Mully eating at 11:14 reminds me of a squirrel with a nut 🤣
Should get a British guy to make fish and chips
No wonder my mothet died
15:51 narrator looks like that gaging cat meme 😂😂😂😂
0:01 OMG my ear holes. Shut up bro. So annoying
5:43 narrator aint even eating it
These idiots don't know what a gyro is 🤦‍♂️
sick collab
Why do they keep narrator around? He doesn't fit in.
Damn, I feel bad for Gabby 22:08
19:00, he sounded German not Mexican.
YALL! I know the boys do the most disgusting and rancid things during these food reviews and my dumb self was eating my breakfast! I’m so stupid. It was only ice cream I had for breakfast, but I felt like there was freaking fish in it or something!
wth is a potato cake
💀
Best collaboration
I could watch them eat bad food all day
“Are you gay?!”  *cue thousands of flashbacks of years past with the vague image of a man in a pink bodysuit and Max in a wedding dress*
arent potato cakes just patato fritters?
crub pach
15:28 When Josh said that is not bussin it killed me😂
Chad: Explains why Australia is superior due to its fresh fruit and veg Also Chad: "Australia has a lettuce shortage"
The fuq 😂😂😂😂 chaos pure...
You should do a video of rating freezer dride candy
Breaking news the boys contract 18 unknown std’s after eating unknown meat
I love that Wyatt brothers laugh. ; )
I got my cold ones hoodie, by far my favorite piece of merch other than the sucker punch jacket
narrator is just theres no input from him
ethiopa man why
Max eats dangerous chemicals on the regular , gets grossed out by octupus lmao
Y did narrator call them chips
i bet narrator only eats what his mom cooks him
as a cold ones fan, i do not think the boys are funny.  and there are too many of them with painted nails
When the wrap came out. Josh: I dont wanna eat that. Eddy: Cmon you have to. Josh: *stares at it with malicious intent*. *literally a second later nose deep in that*
hey i have a hoody like that, weird...
Chad was not speaking Mexican 😂😂 he was speaking Ching chong😭
Chad was not speaking Mexican 😂😂 he was speaking Ching chong😭
Juicy and josh dub is a good combo
Damn the cold ones are so boring compared to the boys
Take a video about this , The world is now ruled by one community of people, the world Satanic elite, you can also call them the committee to meet the Antichrist and prevent the 2nd coming of Jesus, Trump called them the deep state, at the moment it consists of about 10,000 people, the main ones there are Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Windsors, Baruchs, they, their ancestors, descendants and other people who enter there have the mark of Lucifer, which, if they bring the antichrist and do not allow the 2nd coming, they will receive eternal life after the x hour, and the rest of humanity, for all the time that they have lived, they won't get anything, They won't stop themselves
6:01 that’s not how big a fetus is UNLESS ur fetus has been growing for 34 months
5:22 and 29:26 that’s, well, unfortunately what she said…😢
There is some good f****** tipes of fish
4:27 bro the reason mully wanted chad or the white guy’s chewed food more than eddie or the Mexican guy’s chewed food was because of this next photo and this photo: 16:57    HE’S IN A GAY MARRIAGE WITH THAT GUY
26:33
Trying to explain this with it being my first boys video, the blonde guy next to MaxMoeFoe sounds like an American SpiffingBrit
Good content
I would rather let my mum die then get the cloths
headband guy makes me cringe, so agro
isnts that fake army man
The students have disgusted the masters lmfao
bro I almost vomited myself fr fr
Honestly narrator tries to hard for to little
I find it funny vegetarians think plants aren't alive, like what makes them draw the line? The fact they can't speak? Just seems like he wants a categorie to fit in.
its the cold boys
Fuckin love chad when he's with the misfits favorite Crack head
what eddie did to mully in min 7:46 some kid did in the beginning of the school year
The "wrap" is a called a gyro and it’s Greek lamb or should be
always interesting to see big youtubers taste preference because like 90% of them eat like children. they are all narrow in what they like and are so fearful to try new things.
Of course I get a del taco ad right as their reviewing Mexican food
why Australians have such an infatuation with the R slur and yet find the word fuck offensive to the point of censorship is so beyond me. a country of absolute Troglodytes
the chips were yellow because the oil in the fryer was fucking nasty, cleaning a chip fryer everyday makes the chips brown and crispy, but dirty ass reused unchanged oil makes the chips greasy, and they look like playdough yellow chips
I swear Max and Chad carry your vids. No lie.
I like how I got an ad for DoorDash before this video-
the smell of old wet towel is bacteria so those dim sims were definitely covered in bacteria
0:06 12:25 13:39 16:53 16:55 21:38 22:07 23:55
“They chop off ants heads” DONT TELL HIM THAT HE’LL BELIEVE YOU😂😂😂
I eat paper towels everytime i watch the boys review food
5:44 clearly doesn’t take a bite
funny shit
Why live here if Australia’s food is so bad, go back to beautiful Mexico 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣☠️
aww cunts
why is nobody talking about how Max deep throat Eddie's fingers
7:08 bro wtf was that fucking laugh
this is just boring to watch. I get that gimmick is to hate everything but it just lacks imagination.
I do not like this boys but Max and Chad cute
The camerawork at some point actually made me nauseous
Max got hair cake flashbacks
Why is everyone hate sea food, it is good.
No lettuce?! Losers!!!!!!!! Ahhh hahahahah😆
This kids look inbreed.
its fuckin wild how max will eat basically anything on cold ones but is getting grossed out here so easily lmao
Dim sum is not Australian lol
Octopus(if well cooked) is like one of the tastiest seafoods
jezus... The dude who filmed this should be fired...
Dude why you gotta eat it out of his mouth like that for fucks sake literally felt sick watching
sorry guy obama couldnt make it today
I like yah videos but the channel name is cringy af, wouldve like to hear the conversation when yous came up with it
These guys are such pussies would have died if they were there during the cake trilogy.
11:47 my bad
5:47🤮🤮
22:28 no he just hung around frank too much and did too many cake videos so now he puts anything in his mouth
18:40 if chad didn’t remind me of cartman before, this accent does it lmfao! Sounds exactly like Cartland Mexican accent
Came for cold ones, stayed for the boys. New sub earned!
14:35 no mames jaja
I am greek and if that is gyros or souvlaki you know that shit looks horrible 😫
*me being a human garbage disposal* Y’all funna finish that?
im drunk as fuck and i thought i was on the cold ones chanel for like 3 minutes wtf
im not usually squeamish but holy fucking shit i am at the octopus part and almost about to vomit
That's small squid,not octopus
I like how both collabs on both channels each got the same amount of views
Would love to see narrator play bean boozled
This was the best culab yet
Flashback to the hair cake
Seeing people say yuck about the food you’d eat in Asia 😔 jk 🎻
my brother pointed out the collaborations with ya'll. personally the boys are my favorite and comfort youtubers as of now and cold ones are my brothers FAVORITE. and he came to the kitchen to tell me and i already knew so i stared like ""
Do mexicans always have greasy hair?
I'm convinced that Narrator has the pallette of a toddler with how much he 1) doesn't like most of the foods anyway, and 2) the way he fucked up that corn even though he claims he doesn't like vegetables
Feels overdramatized
I’m Mexican and that guy knows almost nothing about Mexican food
Josh:it’s burning my fucking sinuses bro.    Got me laughing so hard😂
7:26 When narrator says It tastes like shity middle school crap it tastes like shity middle school crap
Chad's mexican accent started to become italian
That blonde guy was so dramatic.. acting like a damn sissy girl
hating seafood if not allergic only stems from an early trauma. there are so many different tasting fish, some is really clean tasting white fish. it has no "fishy" taste at all
Nooo this is the kids
Mully aye bruh the freak u eating out of someone mouth 🤣
Octopus with the head is normal btw
Max is by far,the weirdest vegetarian I've ever seen
This is the best series
You guys should pay school dinner ladies to make you school food and review it. Cause school food is dog.shit :)
I will now refer to Max as “The Vegetarian”
Aftermath of bukkake
My soul left my body when it showed all of you were barefoot under the table.
the Mexican too he’s so annoying like we get it your Mexican wtf.
$80 is crazy it only cost $30 to make at the max
I had a MrBeast burger the other week and had to spend 2 days off work on the toilet.
Man Narrator, your stomach is weaker than paper.
cracking up a cold boy with the ones
why they didn't they name it just "cold ones with the boys"?
9:18 he don't fw no lettuce
The collab we needed but didnt deserve.
bunch of schoolboys at a lunch table being loud
I love how max with like drink glue but he’s a vegetarian- 🤣
Why are all these men painting their nails
They ruined my favourite food gyros god damnit
mully was a bottom in the pic
This is the most legendary colab ever
My two favorite groups together in one video.  Fuck it, I'd try a bit of all of that. Except for the quesadilla. Couldn't so much as lick that because cultural shit. 😂
The states don’t have to worry the lettuce shortage is cause everything there is fake😂😂
juicy is like if max was a stoner
Susan is tweaking I got like 3-4 ads watching this hopefully it didn't go to her
Max nearly puking smelling food but eats glue like nothing😂
Btw if you catch the first 6 times you can buy a jacket
I can't get enough of The Boys/The Boys extra, and than they Collab with Cold Ones? Sauced. I hope they do more in the future. What I wouldn't do to be a one video. Just once. Maybe just to meet The Boys. I don't really have a favorite honestly.
Never had to gag from a video befor xD gj guys
Play deadly twister with The Boys
Omg The Boys just made history with Maxmoefoe and fatc*nt all we need is JOJI
I feel really bad for whoever has to clean up all their shit
I regret eatting while watching this
10:22 thats vegetarian
So funny 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
The chaotic energy is everywhere!! It's amazing how Mully keeps eating stuff that's been in other people's mouths without flinching. Juicy's love for eating paper will never falter. Chad decided he wouldn't be outdone. And I don't think trying to feed Narrator seafood will ever be a big hit with him.
It's dim sum and it's not Australian
How does no one at this table properly identify the “wrap” as a souvlaki
Yes Eddie is the only Mexico in Australia
I got the hoodie but damn it took a long time the quality is insanely goodtoo
11:23 close ur eyes and let ur imagination take over🤣
holy shit the up close camera guy's giving me a headache
The boys, the best thing since women.
is that maximoefo?
I think juicy ate more paper than actual food...
22:20 made me act up omg...
The amount of ads for the mech was such a sellout
honestly the cold ones are just meant to be in the boys they are exactly the same
when Eddie picked up the nachos my head said "reminds me of my school lunch"
why are they all barefoot bro no
The old boys and the new boys
why there mo cob was legendayry
First of all dude crab legs are the best thing ever to taste in my mouth so if you say seafood is bad again I will kill you only thing bad is probably yes the octopus but otherwise seafood is god
Bro is vegan and eat fucking cheeze
I would eat all of the octopus
This honestly looks super staged
Mully just let's himself get hurt😭
This is a  masterpiece
is that mofo?
Guys aren't funny and the camera guy should end it all
Why is n narrator such a p***y with food?
My teachers friend edits for juicy
7:46
Consume trash we will
Who's cheese is that?  Nacho cheese.
Vegiterian...dont you mean...malnourished??
Why are they all barefoot 😭😭😭💀
More nachos do u mean more nacho
21:39 YAAAA 💀
3:51 Mully.... My guy..... WHY.
I've had a fever for the past 5 days, I'm 6 minutes in I can't continue. I will have puke all over me.
YOOOO MAX MOEFOE DAMN high quality vid
I NEED FRIENDS LIKE THIS!
YO! I don’t remember one of the guys stroking the corn like that 👀
Jokes on you idiots my mum already dead🤣
the boys started as normal then ended messy
I had my eyes closed in the first time I heard that voice already know that was max how
I’m literally watching this because I have seen every max and chads videos
You guys should def do Google translate Drunk cooking, that's shit would be hilarious🤙
Philipsolotvaustralia
this is a modern day recreation of the last supper
My gaydar is tingling
The cold ones one is funnier
I take it there's no way for me to get a bigger size on the hoodie?
Cold ones and the boys in the same room, it will be on fire in the span of 10 minutes.
T
I love watching these shit food reviews bc people genuinely gagging is the funniest thing in the world to me lmao
Those corns are Actually called Elotes
Bruh if i was YouTube i wode have band you guys bruh you wode have bind suude of making kan tend like this
Bro WTF!
Me personally I like recipe paper😅
The boys and cold ones best of both worlds
mully genuinely makes me want to throw up sometimes ngl
How tf do you get a lettuce shortage
Mmm barbacoa is soooo gooddd
When narrator took a bite of the dim sim he looked like a kid eating a lemon
Play farming simulator
I just got my hoodie and I wish the cool design on the back was on the front so I can see it.
Who eats corn like a Twinkie
I was eating while watching this.  Never again 🤮🤮🤮but good vid
is the cold ones whole thing just baised on ripping off the hot ones? I dont get it
Constantly gagging but god I love these vids
At 11:50 Mully really took the words “im thirsty. Refreshing” seriously
Dude before I told myself to go back I instantly knew I disgusted Chad and Max and they seem like their names need to be changed to Ethan and Nate bro
Alternate title: middle school boys lunch table
I warrior you're merch to school and I got bullied so I beat the kid up and I got suspended for a week.
Personally in my opinion they were annoying
What’s wrong with the MrBeast burger? 🍔😅
Bro is the whitest Mexican I’ve ever seen, from San Diego and think he’s Mexican I’m can speak Spanish guess I’m Mexican now
this will be my last thing i watched on my computer before i get hacked 🙃🙃
Who remembers when max ate a cake made out of vomit and pube hear from different youtubers with idubz and filthy frank and now he's getting close to vomiting to the sight of men being fed slop. What happened
Wtf is Max even doing there! He should never be in this video in the first place
Narrator obviously is able to like corn because it is a grain and not a vegetable.
I like how I’m watching this while eating lol
I FUCKING LOVE YOU MAXMOFOE!❤... and you too Mully I've known you longer
5>42 Narrator aint even eating it, just pretending >D
thats good video the boys🤣
WTF IS THIS CAMERA MOVE, tbh I couldnt focu at all bc it was so chaotic
kinda surprised how max is folding when he ate a cake made out of hair,vomit and and ingredients that you can only get from a human being
hold on IS THAT MAXMOFOPOKEMON!? 1:26 the one reading the paragraph
I preordered but haven’t beat campaign, can I still get this blueprint
i didnt buy it now my moms dead
if that was supposed to be a Gyro then it’s not gonna be fully wrapped. they never are.
Ever heard of a tripod? Wtf is this shitty, vomit inducing camera?
This was like eating with toddlers
Is that Howtobasic?
Octopus and dimsim are so bad?? Yet eating someone hair and vomit was not bad?? Lmao
I'm only 4 minutes in and mully looks like he's on something
"i hate seaf-🤢" 😅
Chad looks he could be Mully's dad!
26:49 how do u fuck up nachos? It's doritos and cheese WTF
Fan fics 4 mully x Chad (mully bottom of corse)
Wow.
Max gagging over this despite doing the cake trilogy blows my mind
Who is the guy with the glasses who acts like he's has severe aspergers
the rap is called pitogyro and that is nott a pytogiro thats its shit
Lost Video of the Last supper
Eddie: im not putting that in my mouth My mind:dont comment that's what she said dont comment that's what she said!
Y do aussies call it dim sim? Its called a Dim Sum. And y is the shiew mai white? its suppose to be yellow.
Narrator spoils the whole video
I’m gonna be honest I would’ve never thought this Collab would  ever happen
Eddie los burritos si son mexicanos, se comen un putero en el norte de México 🤠No son TEX MEX
F*****CK I MISSED IT
all I'm saying is... how many of us have been pissed off because we ordered a foot long from sonic....just to have the cheese and half the chilly drug off by the wrapper because some idiot smashed it..... is the closest to assault I've ever come...
Bro I don’t get paid in time to get one and those are fire
Nothin like a couple of cold ones with the boys
this is what i watch when my ED acts up
Maybe have more than one camera lol
I showed my dad this whole video. He’s never seen a single The Boys video, nor has he ever seen a single Cold Ones vid. He absolutely loved this video. He laughed incredibly hard when Max just starting eating the corn on the cob whole.
Ok so I wanted to get merge but it's like 100 dollars for a jacket
The boys:gay but not because if homie kiss u,it doesn't matter its the homie
dont watch this with an appetite
They called the shawarma a wrap it’s supposed to be open
Chads mexican accent sounds like the asian restaurant owner from southpark
some restaurants use towels to steam them. but they probably haven't changed the towels in ages
I was genuinely shocked to find out that Mully and anything4veiws are not the same person
😂😂 Lettuce shortage is the funniest thing ever.
whats with nail paiting? do they think they are edgy or somethin
I swear narrator just doesn’t like food
They r called potato scallops
I wanted the hoodie but it cost too much
Max is like the retired dad who did crazy shit in his younger years but now just sits around drinking beer in the sofa watching people doing crazy shit instead.
The Last Supper but better
Too much of a good thing.
I will physically hurt the camera man if he DOESN'T FUCKING STOP MOVING LIKE A CRACK FUELD ZOOMER ON A SWINGSET FULL OF NAILS
4:43 cutest damn thing 😂
Can we talk about how cute Eddie’s nails are? Like they look so good
"I've never seen a yiros with a yeast infection" LMAO
I’m getting filthy frank vibes
fat blonde girls annoying, the “burger master”
Mully can do anything now  He's kissed Josh😶 He's eaten Eddie's spit and booger😷 And now he ate Chewed up food😫... If mrbeast said to do any of that stuff to be in a mrbeast video... He would be one of the staff members😂😂😂😂😂😂
i remember when max would eat and do anything
I was eating muffins with homemade tzatziki so I could feel their pain
Mully is just Chads little brother
Chips are always yellow
Бедный Макс за весь выпуск съел только кукурузу и немного начос.))
I started crying when he dug his face into that fold 😂
Narrator almost threw up
Why is it trending for men to paint their nails these days?
"I'm gonna swallow the head whole" 🤨📸
i think it’s funny that MAX AND CHAD of all people are alarmed by how chaotic the boys are
Narrator still continues being the biggest bitch when it comes to food 💀
Do they have beef with Mr.Beast?
The dude with the headbands whole personality is being mexican
We need more Cold One collabs Also its sad that Max is vegetarian cause I would love to see his reaction too
Best collab ever
THE BEST COLLAB EVER.
Max knew immediately that if he couldn’t get chad to drink the potato cake oil that Mully was the next best option, there was no hesitation
max and chad just fits in so well in The Boys
i feel like theres a whole other subtext to all of this everyones missing. read between the lines and chads 'easter egg'. these guys are bullies. productions better on cold ones too buuuut the boys can say whatever they want as long as they outnumber them lol.hope the deal went 70/30 or something to justify the hate. drugs are bad mmkay
These guys are asking the guys from hair cake if mildly bad takeaway is gross man
NO MUM😭😭😭
‘Dim sim is Australian’
Mfs aussie and still calling potato scallops "potato cakes"
I just willingly spent half an hour of my life watching grown men play with their food.
Max looks so disgusted... this aint like the old days. That man was a human mixer for a cake. What happened
Why is no-one talking about them all being barefoot. I-
Yeah I'm poor what about it
The burger looks like the ones you get at 7/11 and microwave it in their microwave on setting 4.
I'm actually 100% jealous of you guys. I'd LOVE to have a drink with you all.
Now we just need Eddie to make legit Mexican food for them to test but say it's from a shit restaurant
I love max he always commits to the bit. A real man of the meme!
Good chaotic energy 10/10
fire your camera man
that Mexican man said sour cream is a mexxican staple?
Max has literally eaten vomit cake but gags over a snot rocket 😂
Everyone is finna throw up and Chad just like "It's not that bad, I'd eat it."
Don’t paint your nails ffs
Don’t paint your nails ffs
Don’t paint your nails ffs
My god Chad can actually read when he's sober
Asians like me do like eating squids and octopus like that one
what did eddie think of GYG?
Idk if it’s been said before but Josh legit looks like a male Joey King. Like aggressively like Joey King.
When they showed their feet and why I went and said, "for free??!?!"
anyone simp mully and chad-
they haven’t had enough gyros to know it’s not a wrap and it’s so silly
They rated the Mexican food a -Juan/10
WEARS THE SOCKSSS ALL I SAW WAS TOESS(16:37)
Yo what happened to Max, the dude used to eat vomit and hair
max ate hair and vomit cake but can't sniff a damp ol dim sim
i completely forgot these guys exist and just thought Max and Chad decided to make a new channel with some random dudes.
plz nomore chad and max
why did i think it was okay to eat my dinner while watching this…
Max looking lesbian af
The boys feels more for children to me then cold ones vibe 🤷🏻 anyone else feel like dat lol?
Gross lmaoo
Why is mully just a hairy ass baby bird eating pre chewed food 💀
That Restaurant uses so much oil that America is already planning to invade it
Oooh...Cold ones with the boys!!! 😱😱😂😂 collab made in heaven
Best video I’ve seen in fucking ages! ❤️
Does the cameraman have Parkinsons or something?
I love how squeamish Max is now lol
Mfw same people that ate each others vomit/hair
Just started watching the video but this first review was over 6 years ago I know places that change owners/change multiple times in 1 year yet alone 6 ahaha Back to the video I know it's gonna be great 🔥👌
Why are they so touchy?
The oil dripping part actually almost made me vomit in bed at 12:50 in the morning
S C A L L O P
How tf is a soda odd the restaurant doesnt make the soda
Had us all gagging
This is literally one of the greatest things I have ever watched. I need more of the boys and the cold ones together!
The boys and the Eboys need to collab frfr😂❤
Netflix presents the last supper
i love how josh called it gyros like we do, love from greece lol
Nice to see them give equal opportunity employment to cameramen with Parkinson's
Why the table set up like max is Jesus in the last supper
Max has a channel maxfoepokemon
Chad should star in Nacho Libre 2! 😂😂
narrator is kind of a pu---
Man just let juicy have his paper
loud LOUD have to be LOUD and FAST FAST and LOUD watch me I am LOUD and FAST
This video. Was fucking amazing. Im  GENUINELY surprised at chad and max's reaction to the boys. Cold ones are tough cunts. They gone soft
fineally some good fucking content
How THE FUCK is max almost vomiting.  HAS ANYONE ever seen his original youtube channel? Look at his videos from 9 years ago. Shit he did with filthy frank and how to basic. OMG
23:28 "have you ever had barbacoa before?" "Thats the thing squidward said" Ah a man of culture with the spongebob references
it’s so sad i ordered a hoodie one October 2nd and i still haven’t gotten it ):
How many ads. 20th fucking add 15 mins in
This should be the boys
The amount of times I gaged while watching this is too many-
Cold boys
They told Gaege to stop eating paper, while I straight up eat paper in band class
Seeing max grossed out is so funny to think about knowing he's eaten hair cake with cigarette candles
Man that blond dudes voice is fucking annoying. Speak normal bro, this ain't no movie trailer.
This camera man is fucking awful
I feel bad that they torture themselves for us
🤮🤮🤮🤮 not 🚫
I think Mully Is gay-
love your vids
When you don’t got filthy frank you get the boyssss
*lettuce shortages are high.*
Who babysits these futher muckers?  I’ve not seen this level of special needs in my entire life.
This was absolutly foul
This camera makes me nauseated....
I feel like Josh is a mafia boss
2 Mullys
For a person who ate the human cake, the vomit cake and other shit Max is really soft haha
k vbyx f
go dress up like dinosaurs
Nah how mully just straight up took the octopus
Eddies gorgous nails✨✨✨>>>>>>>>>>>>
Next the boys try the worst rated prostitute
josh is the older brother of juicy and mully and chad would be the parents and eddie is the Mexican uncle, narrator is everyone's favorite cousin and max is the neighborhood kid that was probably forced to be there  edit: (i wanna see max and juicy do a collab)
for 4 minutes i didnt recognized these guys until i had filthy frank flashback
The Boys, Max, Idubbbz, and FilthyFrank should do a collab and make another cake video
😢I lost membership
I shouldn't have watched this while I was eating.
max made mayo on the cob
love the content but eddy my horror man try dead space
wth dimsum is so good 😭
Hi
I find it funny how Max gets so queezy easily now. Dude literally ate a cake made out of his own hair and one out of his own vomit. 😂
This fucking sucks. This isn’t even Mexican food. They are so blind to good they usually eat. So fucked. I love cold ones and this is the worst thing they made.
i see new members i dont know who are they put they getting good show lol 😆
I love watching deadly twister with Chad and maxmofo. That was one of my most favorit vids that they made
this video is digusting an brought out my inner ocd an anxiety to being sticky n covered with grease, but i love you josh n eddie
8:07 based
26:33 yo screengrab this for josh’s toes
I love that Max has eaten a cake with hair, vomit, pubes, piss, toenails, chewed food, ect but won't eat mushrooms
when he said burritos were more texmex i died inside lmfao they from california
this shitty camera man causing motion blur is making my head hurt jesus just use tripods
THE PERFECT COLLAB I LOVE BOTH UR CHANNELS 🎉😊😊
The fact that noone has socks on is hilarious
The boy dangerous level  2000  Hasbulla danger level   99999.9
The cold ones group  after meeting the boys  Them:traumatized
Was it good? No I hate sea-aug 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is just fucking hilarious😎👍😂
The fact that rating was over 6yrs ago
Idk why but I just enjoyed chad saying “want some soap”
Chad just said that Dim sum is a take on Australians making dumpling lmao
Is this giving max flashbacks from eating HowToBasics Food
At 11:02 you can see all their feet😂😂😂
Only in Ohio
I think that the cold ones should be part of the boys
Cold ones with the boys
Man I’m gaggin watching this
Nah that fucking burger looks like shit
its called dim sum
So if we don’t buy it our mom dies hmmm must’ve bought one years ago
Jokes on you my mom is already dead lol
WHAT YALL COLLABED OMFG AWESOME
I’m from Florida
Hair cake vibes
Jokes on you my moms already dead😎
Honestly, when Chad used his "Spanish pass" he sounded like mole from Atlantis. XD
1 out of 13.25
Cold ones with The Boys. Nice
pls the boys never do any video with food, now I can't get food down my throat..... pls
BRUH! For real the rap looks like a fucking Pizza rapt like a rap
Ayy I'm here
"it can't be that bad the reviews are just overr-...oh"
I don't think the boys understand how Beast Burger operated before they opened a location. They operated out of "ghost kitchens." Basically, a restaurant cooked Beast Burger and their own food. The bad restaurant is to blame for the shitty Beast Burger, not Beast Burger themselves. MatPat made a great video on his Food Theory channel
Best video ever and collab 😍
Buncha crack heads
best collab bro
You know it’s good when even Max And Chad are caught off guard
nachos look microwaved, that’s what we call ghetto nachos
Cool to know whose gay by their fingernails.
Chad sounded like cartman
i two words, i frew up
At 8:32 markerplier😂
Every time man🤣🤣🤣😭😭 rofl
not my goofy ass checking the store for the jacket when this was posted 9 days ago
Gay boys
Im like juicy when im at school lol
Max should open more Pokémon cards😊
3:33 do the chip taste like octopussy?
Why tf is the first thing I thought of is the last supper when I saw them all at the table XD
BRO 26:24 IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN YOU HIT A PIG IN MINECRAFT-(The boys i have a question.what if juicy did not exist?)
Narrator u shoukd let the boys eat MRE’s
I stared to laugh so hard when he shot the food out of his nose XD
love the hoodie, but i luckily didnt have to buy it, mom been gone💀
why do I always watch these videos while i’m eating😭😭
Why did Josh’s “barf” sound like a pig ? While narrator eating the burrito
give max some Dahmer glasses and he's a murderer
you should do it with best cheap food
one of the best crossovers ever
EWWWW MULLY
The ad with mully 🤣  love you guys
Cameraman pov : your a kids birthday party
Eddie showing a burger in mollys mouth 😂 😂
Are they not native?
1:31 who writes that my mom does
4:24 ah Eddie wants to give Mully head.
Unclaim
funny as fuck.
i should've known that juicy would give the corn a handjob lmao
Bro why the hell fo you guys make everything messy its so disgusting
How did juicy know what chewing on a Condom was like 😅😂😂
the boys got so close with eachother they literally treat eachother like brothers its amazing
Should I be proud that this was posted on my birthday
why did i think it was a good idea to watch this while eating dinner..
Eddie "that meat is ....." Guy in purple shirt "what are you even saying"  Me thinking it would've been a great time for mully to chime in with a sort of joke like "still to this day we have no idea" 🤣
yuck and HOLA
"Don't buy it and your mum" Mully: "Will die" me: "ha HA she already did!"
Okay, I know it was to make people pause on the merch ad but... That Markiplier cardboard cutout.... *Slams credit card violently* I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK >:D
Juicy gave that corn a hand job
i almost made my goal of not throwing up for 4 years until i saw this video
Why is max vegetarian it makes life boring
wonder how r u guys not like DIM SUM
How are people allowed to sell this🤢
if you want to eat good Greek food. Come to Greece you wont find good Greek food enywhere but Greece
The mr beast is quite nice near me
How do you go from eating hair, cake, and Ramen with the devil to being a weak stomach vegetarian? 💀
If I have to pick between the shit in this video, and McDonald’s. I’ll fucking eat mcdonalds
I really wanna be part of the boys, o alright then the cold ones then! Haha i cant be part of the vlogs 'cuz i live in the netherlands...
i still stand by my theory that Mully is just some homeless crack addict that they slapped a VR headset on
the warp is called sovlaki
I can't believe you didn't see the eyes in the church left window
22:20 Max gives Eddie the “guac-guac 9000”
I like how mully says he feels so gay literally Chad and Mully
These are the boys who take the meaning “live life to the fullest” on a whole different level. ❤❤
This actually made me think about how Mully talks about how he used to be a certified chef and Eddie always talks about how no one makes legit Mexican food so I thought why not a Boys cooking challenge and have the Girls be the judges with some prize/punishment on the line
10:21 I just wanted to eat meh food.
Mully was like, don’t think just do.
It’s nice to see the boys on their best behaviour
When did post malone take off his tattoos to join The Boys and date Mully?😂❤️
JOKES ON YALL MY MOMS ALREADY DEAD.... 😞
nooooooooooooooooo
octopus when cooked properly is great
yay
That one guy who's "mexican" needs to stop milking it
Maxmofoe!?
Look men I. Sad to watch you guys hating on Greek it's not even made from a Greek person if you come at Greek belive me
Yo who is this camera man. Your focus pulling  is shocking I can't see shit XD
Copyright the other boys.. yknow .. the series for stealing your name.. Idk how to copyright someone
Wait a minute hold on for a sec 8:33 did I just see a fucking mini cardboard of markiplier?
that is not pico!
You guys should react to helluva boss just put in some warnings and you won’t have to censor anything😁
🤢🤢🤢
want to know one of the best foods God created on this putrid earth Comales best food ever
that first place literally got busted for serveing bait octopus and squid thats why it still had its head on literally fishing bait   look it up
Wait fat white guys can have dreads now? I'm asking the dude in the yellow, as a fat white guy who shouldnt have dreads.
Now The Boys have to make merch of Eddie as Jesus giving Nachos to the rest of the boys as the disciples 😂
Nobodys talking about how max was ordering a burger on the mcdonalds app????
When will reeked join
I hate how they keep ragging on the person with dietary requirements. Like, it's not funny, it's bullying.
juicy I would rather eat my own shit then eat a mr beast burger 😂
how did narrator survive the army?
mully bro i love you and the boys but the amount of times i saw a merch ad i had a full on stroke😭😭
I bought a hoodie was so excited the it was stolen by my neighbor I really hate my life right now
When's the next fanfic video?
Yes maxmoefoe is collabing  with the  boys my favourite  two channels
I never realized how much more chaotic the boys can be compared to the OG chaotic YT creators! I loved this collab so much
2 of my favourite ppl collabing with another 5 of my other favourite ppl. The best ppl combined. Almost like a deformed fusion dance
We need more of cold ones and the boys
Day 1 on asking the boys to play *these cards will get you drunk*
LMAO
The bad thing is i mad the mistake of eating while watching this video
The boys review but we have a vegan 💀
Narrator sounded like an Australian girl 25:56
We just watched the boys have a mediocre lunch with friends 😂
At 7:49 that reminds me of the pizza video
camera is so blurry. get a proper 60fps 4k camera.
U guys always find a way to make me smile I love your vids but kinda miss the old green gang vr vids 😀😀😀 they always put a smile on my face, keep up the great work❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
bruh juicy and max should be brothers
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
My Birthday Is On 8 Oktober
I’m surprised that nothing was thrown at the wall
3:52 reason why Mully keeps getting covid. Lmfao
shouldn't disrespect vegetarians like that.
let's be honest, even good dim sims are foul. I've never eaten them but seen how they look and smell.
Isn’t that  Max mofo
I remember when you guy were funny
heddo 👋
Max does not want to be there someone behind the camera is holding a gun to his head. 🤣🤣🤣
I can’t believe Max is gagging at this when he used to eat human hair and vomit in a cake with Filthy Frank
29:41 I was thinking the exact same thing of someone getting fucking power slammed into the table but I expected it to break in half
MULLLLLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYY EEEEEEEEEEEEEDIIIEEEE
If you guys came to souix falls I could make better nachos
Veggo team
I'd eat everything and love it
Mully has become like a dictator 😂
finally ly
28:56 best quote
The squid looks just fine to me lol
Not narrator looking like a gaging cat lmao
My grandma died recently and these videos are helping me smile through the pain. She died of pneumonia this morning actually so please send your prayers🙏🙏🙏
Here me out boys I need narrator to do a Seth Rogan impression and Josh to do Terrance and Phillip from south Park !!
Max saying don’t eat that to paper, when I have literally seen this guy eat a cake made out of hair toenails spit and piss
The boys should go to Mccamey Manor and if you make it to the end you get 20 thousand dollars
these food places need Gordon Ramsy
Who's the f*** is that
😂😭😂😭😎😭😂😞😋😋😋😋
4:45 awe what a nice family photo.
I'M SO HAPPY I'M CRYING BRO I GOT THE HOODIE IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES 😭
Bro this even made max disgusted and he does random weird shit
josh mully and there wifes or gf and move to usa for more of these hella funny videos
Ed really said "I'm giving you a Mexican pass." As if it was the n word
I love that max has eaten clay and glue  but won’t eat the lettuce
I have the flu right now and this is making gag even more the sickness😂😂😂
8:53 i think it’s a Döner we love this in Germany
I was in the bathroom when I saw this and this video helped
mully is gross
bro eddie said Champorado EDDIE IN THE PHILIPPINES WE ALSO HAVE Champorado  EVEN AT SCHOOL :)
nah just wondering but.... is that maxmoefoe????
i never thought the legendary Maxmoefoe would collab with the boys! jeez i haven't seen this guy ever since he did the howtobasic vids. Honestly they should try out HowToBasic's foods! lol
from what ive heard, most beast burger locations are good, its just a few that are bad, so i think the boys are being kinda unfair
I MIGHT BE GOING TO PAX OMGMGMGMGMGMGMMG IF KRISTY IS THERE THEN DUDE I WILL BE ON MY KNEES AT HER BUT LIKE IF NOT THEN ITS FINE
You guys should test your knowledge of different countries
Were is pax in Melbourne
chad is like if narrator and juicy had a baby
I love yall but my mom hates yall😣
Can someone plzzzzz tell me whats the beef between mr beast and the boys lol
WTF?  Drugs, man, drugs. This is your life. 🙄
Y'all imagine if they went to a hypnotist,what would they do?😂
Max is defs traumatised now
barbacoa is a type of meat from cows if im correct like ummmm longganisa which is also from cows but if barbacoa is not from cows let me know  l v
20:45 "Why there NO COB?!" I am dying
There not wereing sockssss
You need to try zambereo it is good.
This is crazy
the boys are soo funny but so fucking gay sometimes
After a long ass work day coming home and watching The Boys always makes my day better.
norrr clorerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Yall forget max is how to basic
26:24  Max and Chad reliving the wedding from Human Cake with everyone making vomiting noises around them
Dim SUM is literally a traditional Chinese dish. Lol that Chad said Australia 🦘
Josh: Oh no our table  Everyone: it's broken
5:14 zest ahh
Josh looks like Jeffery dahmer
Seeing this video reminds me of Max and Chad 's older days in youtube, their vibe is like when they made videos with Frank, Idubbs and howtobasic a nostalgic chaos.
Dumbest shit I’ve seen on YouTube in years.
"Potato scallop"
Bro I’ve been tripping balls and watching this made it even better but screw you for giving me the munchies
The way I constantly felt repulsed and disgusted yet surprisingly entertained reminds me of when I used watch Filthy Frank. This video has brought back so many emotions
Every time i watch the boys food reviews it makes me throw up but the same time watch them suffer food poisoning and laugh
My mom will die? But she is already dead been dead for 4 Years. Lmao I still love the boys though
Please do The Boys cooking with HOWTOBASIC
Hell yeah finally now They just need HOWTOBASIC
they are always sooo over dramatic in these videos its annoying
It looks like eddie has deidara's ring
The way Mully isn't afraid to eat seafood gives hope to girls like me with a messy downstairs.
get that veagn motherf*cker out chad can stay he is cool
Pause at 10:20 wat has mankinde become XD
Grilled occy is freakin awsome
I went to Australia for 2 weeks and found that they have subdogs
i want someone to looka at me like mully is looking at chad at  4:44
Thanks the boys i could not swallow my own spit after this vid
That food look delicious pov me eating it
IS THAT MAXMOEFOE
Chad I think looks like Jeffery 😭😭😭
not me gagging watching this video
8:32 bruh the little markiplier
Max: HERE COMES THE CHOO CHOO TRAIN
These people have their *MERCHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!*  | | | | v
Send me one you rich cunts xx
Bro they went off the hook with the pussy jokes
Put those grippers away
Max is literally having flashbacks to Filthy Frank.
Eddie how good is your mom's Mexican food be 100 percent honest
Is that @maxmoefoepokemon
26:01 Narrator racist??
Narrator: *Is a veteran* Also Narrator: *Vomits at the slightest taste*
bro im sorry but narrator keeps bsing everyone of these or other videos like this he fakes it 5:43 he litteraly takes a fake bite. im sorry to say but hes not boys material anymore
My girlfriend: he’s prolly out with another girl Me:
I bought the one chip challenge chip and all I did was lick the corner and I died
Perfect collaboration
noooo why did max do that to eddie that was so weird but funny im still laughing
7:10 chad laughs in reverse
These two groups actually work well together
28:55 had me dying 😂😂😂
i like how eddie is barely included in the video shoot
"Buy it or your mom will die" jokes on you my mom is dead but I will buy one
Maxfomfoepokmon?
This is nasty
The only channel to tell the truth of the Beast burger
Hello pech hello you are a  You are y
We loved this collab i want morr
26:33 Josh feet
YOUR HOODIE IS FUCKING 80 DOLLARS
Butter❤
Cold ones are annoying af.
i think this is the cleanest josh or juicy has come out of from a  food video
Chad started to go French lol
S
these guys make the most disgusting things funny to the point where i cant stop watching bro 😭
hi the boys i was wondering if u guys wanted to colab with nitro enterprizes we are some dum people that wish to meet u
Wow
I love octopus but that looked a bit questionable
Hey guys I don’t know if you will see this but all over the place i have been seeing loads of juiced edits and some of them are so funny. There are ones of all of you too but the juicy ones are so funny 😂😂😂
Ive been looking all day to see if the sweatshirts will restock. They haven't 😭
All I can think of is the boys x cold ones ship name cold ones with the boys
The weirdest part of the video is when it was revealed that they were all indeed barefoot. And I can only imagine the amount of footsies being played under that table 😂😂😂
All this gagging sounds like competition deep throat.
that first one has so much oil the usa is hunting it down
FANFICS FIVE PLEASE WE ARE BEGGING!!!!😭
🇵🇰❣️🇵🇰
I just was about to buy it cause I had school but I was an hour late I’m very sad you have no idea rn
Please go to best kebab in Scotland
Day  293 of asking you to add smashing as a member of the boys
I NEED THE SUCKER PUNCH MERCH TO COME BACK I WANT HOODIE AND BANDANA
What kind of problem does he have with seafood?
That’s funny he sounded like a German and Italian Mexican 😂😂😂😂
BRO TAG ME IN A COMMENT THAT ISNT ABOUT THE COLLAB
The Boys. Please answer me this. Why would you mute somone on Discord for saying HI to you? A paying subscriber of your channel. Can somone please explain this to me?
this is fucking disgusting i almost vomited
Eddie is the one friend everyone has who goes above and beyond for a joke crossing the line of funny and trying to hard😂 Doesn't take away the fact I absolutely love the boys dynamic and they all bring something to the table.
Im apart of the poor category ;c
MULLY WHAT THE FUCK!!!🤮🤮🤮
imagine if they have filthy frank
josh every food video
It’s not a wrap it’s supposed to be warped like that
My favourite series
You guys should try food from different countrys and review it :).  Start with Canada 🇨🇦 ❤
8:32 MARKIE MOO
Great recovery by Josh at the end there
Did Eddie just said chanpurrado? We had that in the Philippines here! It's really good 😋😋🇵🇭
The boys need to go to the museum of shadows
Boys, this Uber eats video has a DoorDash ad 💀
We all know what the sauce is😏
What do you think about it carl
Can mully be kicked from the boys for that
You should come to Gold Coast and Brisbane it's
bro my stomach started to hurt when they squeezed the potato cakes 💀
the funny part is im greek and our speciality is the gyro at somewhere 10 minutes and it looked really good
we can see the boys lacking with these vids, get some length in
Make a shirt where it says “the cold boys``
@coldones please take the boys to a decent meal
You guys in Melbourne?! I'm in Melbourne Glenroy
Spoiler!  There's a Easter egg! 🙏
13:10 Well, I dont think you guys need to worry about that place, clearly they have enough oil for the US to take interest in it...
react to dreams face
stop fucking moving the camera so aggressively
Yooo the boys back in Australia again I thought I would have to wait a year les goo
Poor narrator
Why is max so cute
Narrator was us army. How tf is he so squeemish with food
That tortilla looks like actually shit bro I'm so glad I live in Texas where we have actually good Mexican food
The first food Eddie was f*cking that sh*t up
Tell Eddie to go to Guzman e Gomez for Mexican food
why is it everytime i watch a boys video im always eating something and mully has to do something fucked up dam it mully im trying to enjoy me chickem tendies
why is juicy being shy rn? /.\
as soon as I saw this video I came
The best collaboration of 2022
I swear Josh's tastebuds are crying
These motherfuckers are funny but they do the most outta pocket shit😂😂😂
im ganna goet one for my birthday (oct 3)
5:48 narrators face😃
Not the yellow hoodie guy with the braids💀💀aint no way
Is it only me thinking Chad and juicy have the same felling?
the merch  looks cool  but miss the chance for it to say the cold boys
Best and funniest collab YouTube will and has ever seen
This video is just peer pressure at its finest.
i would deffently buy the new hoodie W's but im poor and i cant offer one.  also the burger is the only good thing i saw in the whole video
It's ironic how the Mexican restaurant had the best paper when they can't get their papers
22:28 this scene😂
Yessss
this guys have been living too modern of a life they cant even eat octopus they taste great bro what the hek??
Mully and chad are like two little brothers.
I hate max.... that is all
ew... Melbourne...
why is a boy wearing nail polish?
wow i have never seen mully flirt so hard before until i watched this
Good old boys! I love y’all! Been watching since 2020 yo.
This is my first time watching the boys food review. NEVER AGAIN 🤢, I love the boys but not this.
This video makes me think Australia is going to start the next coronavirus  pandemic
I literally have the same nails as eddie rn
we needed this
is it only me or middle one looks like Maxmoefoe
Wow
Eating food while you guys eat food is not the move 💀
Max saying no to being fed lettuce cause it’s gross but did human cake years ago
Yes
I got that hoodie, hell ye. Time to get beat up.
The dude in the purple pisses me off, I don't like vegans and I hate when people disrespect seafood
The shift of Maxmoefoe from eating absolutely anything put in front of him into someone who dislikes mushrooms is some Twilight Zone shit.
Max kinda looks like a serial killer
Chad: I worry about your mental health  Mully: Me too  Everyone watching: What mental health
Anyone else can’t stand Eddie?
The Boys and Cold Ones collab videos are just 1000% gold
No I'm the burger master I would eat it raw
PLEASE DO ANOTHER VIDEO WITH THEM AGAIN PLEASE
7:09 Why does he laugh like baby squidward
Spitters are quiters
Yes sir
The best Collab
Lol burritos are from Cd. Juarez 😂

Maxmoefoe returns

25$ for 3 pairs of socks
Bro it's a hamberber
Mully is Eric cartmens dad
Have not meet this guy before - josh 2022  To much mayo - juicy 2022

I really shouldn’t have watched this whilst eating dinner 😂🤣🤢
8:33 Why is Markiplier in the merch plug LMAO
0:42 why does dude have cornrows
My mom is gonna die because I’m poor because of you subscription
My favorite part is when max deep throat Eddie's finger

The boys on the trending list makes my heart so happy ❤
Love food reviews
The dream collab

This collab is outright amazing
Waht the heck did the guy think while he was making that gyros💀
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
MAXMOEFOE JESUS CHRIST
Mully asking if someone's gay is the most comical thing ever
Wow lame
was that markiplier
Aye yo is the cold ones just the nockoff of the hot ones
it just feels like a  cold ones video just without the edditing of prezo
Maxmoefoe `s postcard collection
more fan fic opertunities >:)
The reason why I don't like Emily or some people don't is because it's because he laughs that he bullies Mexican and he's also he laughs at every time someone loses or wins he gets mad when he's someone loses
Jokes on you guys my mom is already dead
Was your camera man having a seizure while filming this? Jesus Christ stop moving
Max looks like he’s planning something incredibly evil lmao
Oh this is the Collab I needed and wanted. This is hilarious 🤣
I’m Waiting For The 3 Days To Be Up So I Can Finally Di-

This video made ME fucking nauseous
I think the boys need to go to the mr beast restaurant
jesus crist this is fckd up
this collab works so well
Mully: are you gay, got me😂
At the end when the table broke I said "oh no our table" and then I looked at the screen and I saw you guys do the same🙃😆😆
I rather stick with the horror videos instead of the food video🤢☠💀
I just saw the tf2 spy in the comments
The way mully said he was gonna throw up in the end🤣😂
This is like the school lunch table every day
You should do the worst fidget spinners against a good fidget spinners I konw from 2016 but you should do it  the best fidget spinner is go bigger pill bug, fidget, spinner
Narrator narrator narrator narrator narrator narrator
3:50 is why i love mully.

Hey boys Do you think one day you could come close to Michigan one day It would be so cool to see you guys 🎉🎊

The Collab ive been waiting for
When he spat at 28:36 it was spine chilling...
Best hoodie by far
This is currently my favorite video ever made
I didn’t exactly read the title of this video before sitting down w/ my lunch and watching this
OH MY GOD
never expected this but i love it
Who is vegetarian I mean why anyway so you ate mayo then you ate an egg
When senpai eats the corn is that how he eats "cat"?😏
Mully at the end lol, "im going to throw up."
damn i havent seen max and chad since i watched filthy frank regularly...nice to see em still around!!
Champurrdo is da best
I’ve been fucking dying to see these aussies and us boys get to it🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧, chad n mully look like big chads Eddie doesn’t look right no more , sorry🤝🏼
I can't deal with ya'll sometimes lmao. So gross.
at 21:29 i started wheezing seeing juicy mayo fingers popping out of nowhere😭🤣
YES the colab we have all been waiting on drunk idiots and normal idiots
Eating and vomiting with max and chad? Hmmm reminds me of someone
You love to see it when the Modern Cake Trios from the Cake Trilogy meets the Modern version
Why does juicy know what chewing on a condom is like?
Im a mexican in australia
Is that mofpokemon come back
@10:15 when Eddie gets revenge with all them mexican jokes they be saying lol
1:27 how do you know what that tasted like??? Sounds kinda sus to me
Am i the only one who understands all of them
"7the to 9th october Melbourne VIC"  Will Mully be hosting a show of the make a wish incident there?
No I get pay on Friday 😭😭😭
this is what my school would cook
I used to watch max do prank calls
is this man British because what the heck is bruary
They burn the tables everytime after these videos
You guys should go to the Karen's restaurant or whatever it's called-
Hey, its Boys Food Review video. Let me eat while I watch because I will get hungry.  2.03 seconds later...: 😦😧😨😰😖🤢🤮😵                        😞😣😖🤢🤮🤮🤮
Mully eating things from other boys mouths again
Cracking open a cold one with the boys
Why tf is this hoodie $80.00 bro wtf
Hola chicos
This may be a controversial opinion but, the boys being messy is not enjoyable at all, it's just disgusting. the mukbang videos are my least favorite and most hated type of content.
i just bought it boyssss
1:34 is that fucking maxmoefoe lol
23:33 Juicy’s hand still covered with a mayo 😭
Max looks so lost after the disappearance of Firuti Furanku
So glad this happened
Literally the favorite two groups colab
why the fuck are none of them wearing socks nahh i aint subscribing
i just ordered the hoodie, lets hope that it gets to my country (aka hungary)
Remember when thr boys used to play vr
I’m pretty sure no one will see this comment, so that’s why I’m posting it here my parents own a food truck and it’s called na-cho bizness, you’ll probably never be able to taste it, but if you ever get the chance too I would really appreciate if you could stop. we live in Minnesota and I can give you more info if needed. I love the video and I hope you guys have a good day!
too sad i will never watch this because of the excessive amount of vomiting and gagging
The boys and howtobasic
Egg fella is apart of the boys Finally someone can read the full reviews
Fucking let’s goooooooooo
Almost threw up my prenatals
hi the boys
mully x chad 4:44
What did beast burger do tooo them 😂😂
smells like octopus pussy juice -joshdub 2022
I  always forget to not eat when I watch the boys
She died when I was 6
My mom is dead 💀 hahahha
I love how mully was just like: Are you gay?!
I’m so fucking happy you guys did a video together I’ve been watching both of your guys channels and you guys crack me up and make my day 1000 times better thank you guys for all of you do! Much love and respect! Just wish I could get a signed shirt from you guys that’s my biggest dream
You guys should try eating a bunch of Haribo sugar free gummy bears. I heard they taste great and “relieve” your hunger (if you know what I mean)
Best collab so far!! I needed this
The crossover event of the year
Wait this was 19 hours ago
They all have crabs
Eat more worst rated food please it makes me laugh when I'm feeling sad and deeply depressed🙂🙂
the table throw looked painful
23:23 Balbacua or Cow's penis and balls 😅 Great soup though again Filipino = Mexican
I could freaking smell that disgusting food, THROUGH my screen 🤮🤢
14:36 its Chocolate porridge or specifically rice with dark chocolate tablet melted. (Champorado is also a Filipino dish)
Damn, it's been a long time since I saw Max
I love how Chad and max the original chaotic YouTubers were intimidated by Jucy's personality. The guy who is literally is called "anythingforviews" was scared of Jucy.
This is the collab that i thought I don't need but hell this guys works good together Cold Ones being your Drunk uncle's and The Boys being your Stupid ass Cousins
Lol, they gotta be really good friends. If my friends did of the stuff they do to eachother, some fades would be caught.
Why are you all barefoot 💀
Eddie talked about Narrator not eating vegetables but ate the corn. In Narrators defense corn in not a vegetable but a starch.
you really need to work on the camera focus
were in Melbourne ill hop on a train and get done there and im in Berwick
I keep pinching myself to make sure this is real
got my exclusive hoodie. lets gooooo
Not the best video to watch when your really nauseous
8:43 as a person from the greek community i say im prety happy that the boys tried our original food however it was made from a shit place so idk its pretty sick if its made right
son unos caretas
Why so nasty again :(
If max ate mayo then he technically ate eggs
hi love you
$80 for a Fuckin hoodie 💀😭
"Why'd they put me next to the guy possessed by a Demon?" 2022
So devo….can’t afford the new hoodie but I want it SOOO bad 😭😭😭
Bruh, best crossover ever 😮😮😮
Imagine filthy frank making a cameo in the boys video
Eating food that someone else chewed on is how you get sick Mully over here gets octopus from Chad’s Mouth lol
i quite enjoyed watching this during dinner
im not getting the hoodie only coz u said u would kill my mum if i didnt get it. pls kill her :)  p.s: ima sue u i threw up coz of u
79.99 for a hoodie😭
8:32 Anyone else notice the cardboard cutout of Markiplier?
Seeing this video reminds me of Max and Chad 's older days in youtube, their vibe is like when they made videos with Frank, Idubbs and howtobasic a nostalgic chaos.
best collab
The demon energy
corn boy: its corn😡🤬🤬🤬
Damn
Ya
OMG THE GOD DAMN LETTUCE SHORTAGE. THEY OUT SPINAGE ON OUR BURGERS AT MY HIGH SCHOOL AND IT TASTS LIKE GRASS
Next time do "eating the best food" why not
Anyone knows why they hate Beast Burger so much?
meogw
More collabs
Hmmmmm this just so mmmmmm
I was thinking abt this collab last night my dream came true
Watched this when I was eating, common W
who tf is chad and max
Max seems like a normal person compared to everyone else   Edit: after watching the whole thing i would like to take back what i said...
theres enough oil there america is invading tomorrow. hope all aussies are ready for some freedom
FINALLY.
There should be a cold boys chennel
I thought the Guy in the Middle was juicy lmao
Why do you always release limits time merch when I got no money 😭😭😭
so i dont have to kill my mum yay
10:14
19:11 I just had corn cooked in a pan
10:13
10:12
Is it just me, or did Josh not gag a single time??
They were so not ready for Juicy and Eddie😆😅
Seriously you guys are really just recycling old content at this point. Please, as a guy that's trying his best to keep being a fan, please just make some new shit. I'm sick of seeing shitty food reviews and hide & seek in big open spaces. And don't even get me started on The Boys Xtra, Seriously are yall just gonna be posting tiktok reactions on there? Get a grip. If you wont put in the effort to make unique content just go back to making vr skits, damn.  Trying not to shit on you guys cuz I'm trying to stay a fan but this is getting pathetic in my opinion.
I LOVE THIS COLAB!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE COLAB AGAIN!!!!!
Noice
Bro I love champorado, it’s like chocolate rice soup and u put creamer on top and mix it in and eat it like that
I want more gang beasts
I knew this day would come... it's a nightmare come true
the boys are the best
Max 100% is having flashbacks in the video.
Juicy casually invented a new dish with that chip orb
Eddie try Guzman y Gomez if u haven’t already would be funny to see a Mexicans opinion on it
WE NEED BIGGER SIZES I AM FAT AND I WANT MERCH
I love that they are cpollabing
Yusssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss. Ssssssssssssss. Thnx.
Who is the guy in the middle
21:11 Perfect laughter
narrator: i hate sea foo-"casually turns into that one cat meme"
MY FAVOURITE YOUTUBERS ALL TOGETHER OMFG, I NEVER BOUGHT A HOODIE SO FAST IN MY DAMN LIFE
Chad gets the burrito eater pass from me
i got an email about the merch
The chips are yellow BC of the oil they fry it in
How effing dare Eddie call it corn on the cob and not elote .. I’m pulling his Mexican card lol
This is why i've never watched the boys while eating😂😂😂
Yeahhhh this collab is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Eddie: *abusing mully* Mully: *getting abused by eddie* Max: *the vegan* Chad: *the vegan chad* Juicy: *juicy* Josh: *well...vomiting. i mean wtf do u expect from that little fucking goblin*
19:28 - 19:42 Eddie Know What He Talkin Bout
Juicy is the glue that holds this family together
Can y'all get a up jacket with no hoodie
food
The Collab of the centure
Bruh the hoodie is 80 quid
This is the collaboration ive been wait for, for what feels like forever
Why tf can’t u do a meet and greet in cairns Australia
you know what i dont like about narrator he thinks about it too much
Max with the power move on the corn 10/10😂🖤
Did everyone else notice Eddie's nails I love them
i think The Eboys+The Boys would be pretty cool
Josh getting a double powerbomb on the table was the most unexpected thing I've seen since following each of the boys for the last 3 years
finally the aussies outnumber the americans😈
finally... another ubereats video
Juicy: *straight up j/o-ing a corn* Eddie: “He’s shaking its hand hand, man.”
I finally know why mully is so frocking fat it’s because his friend keep force feeing him😂😂
Max ate nachos with cheese on it when he's a VEGETARIAN
What was the make a wish 2020 thing about explain ❤
Narrator if you did your nails could you do mine please pretty please 🙏 I love the style of them
I swear, none of these videos can ever be normal. Still funny asf tho.
Chad and juicy are a lethal combination
my one word is nice👍
I don't know why u decided to eat while watching this video
Mully looking at yellow jacket guy like Nikocado looks at KFC
Im waiting for the food review with all the boys
The reason why we have a lettuce shortage is because the Floods destroyed many farms.   So no we aren’t “losers” it’s was a massive flood that destroyed many. I’m sure you Americans know about that now with this new cyclone.
prove me wrong the boys and game grumps would be perfect
Why are all the boys painting there nails now
Please collaborate more ❤❤❤❤
I wish I could but I can't 😭
Savior of this video is max and Chad
Yes
"If you don't buy it your.. uh.. uh, mom will.. die!"  Plot twist I want my mom to die :0
Bro for your next video you should find the worst rated hotel
**Gets out credit card** **Remembers hubs' mom already died, so no hoodie** **Puts away credit card** **Sad noises**
Love the collab,do more!!! However,the iffy/ shitty reviews on the Mexican food in Australia brings a brilliant idea to mind.   Eddie should set up shop and open a restaurant!!! No no square Tacos!!!   I'll come cook with him!
LITERALLY BEEN WAITING FOR THIS COLLAB FOR SO LONG
hey Eduardo i got a question for you.....        how do you like panini bread?
Narrator is every video of every cat gagging.
the collab we all need, is The BoysxThe Misfits. now that, would be one hell of a collab. absolutely perfect.
Nice! Eddie knows Champorado. I thought it was only in the Philippines but I guess it was brought in by Spaniards
10:07 the laugh.
The guy in yellow looks like Bray Wyatt ❤🤘
HAHA NARRATOR GAGGED LIKE THE GAG CAT
🐵 oo oo HOO OO HOO OO AAH AAH AAH AAAH
i regret eating while watching this
Real Mexican my ass Overexaggerating saying Torrrrrtilla, Burrrrrritooooo, and Pico De Gallo When was the last time you had a home cooked meal?
I CAN'T STOP REPEATING THIS FRAME 22:19
At the time Josh WENT FOR THAT... Burrito. At the back of his head Josh's discord server was HYPING HIM UP
its kinda weird seeing two generations of youtubers in one video.. even tho theyre practically the same age
I love octopus
100 dollars chill with the price
80 dollars wtf
Yes mother tree have yes
Cool                                                                                         Yeah but I do have are doing but I do have a are you off yes yes yes yes yes yes Noch
YEEEEEEEEES!!!!!!

“ARE YOU GAY” 😭
how did max shove those fingers in his mouth without gagging bruh☠
They all have their sicks off and they're all acting gay
MY 2 FAVORITE YOUTUBERS COLAB YESSSSSSS
All of my favorite Australians in one place
Why do I feel like they belong to be in the boys everyday
I HAVE BEEN IN MELBOURNE MY WHOLE LIFE IM IN GLENROY BTW
Let’s go

Legit the best collaboration 🎉
23:39 Who the fuck has a lettuce shortage? Had me dead
Max moe foe post card collection
Why does mully have to eat anything that comes out of someone's mouth
this video is how covid started
They should join the boys
You didn’t had to do mr beast like that 💀💀💀
Food food food
The collab no one wanted but still happened😂😂😂😂😂
best collab do more of these plz
bro best colab get more with cold ones
3:00 how the f#$% is an alcoholic vegetarian
At 20:56  there laugh killed me! 😂
This combined three of the best things ever, The Boys and Cold Ones, oh and food.
This is the wrong video to watch when you’re eating dinner😅 I was going so good until the potato cakes!
Please do more of these there my favorite 😂
Eddie not saying a single word for 3:05
yessir?
They should totally change mully for chad
I keep forgetting to not eat any food while watching them 🤮
If may mom see me watching this shit she would banned me for watching this shit for a 14 year old girl
Just bought the hoodie 😎
MAX YOU NEED TO POST
MAX MY BOY
MaxMoefoes POSTCARD COLLECTION
the greatest collab ever
Who is that guy
Eddie has inspired me to try the Valentina salsa picante and I have no regrets. It's flavorful not over powering, spicy but not painful. I love it!!! Thanks Eddie!!!
Josh looked like his girl made him eat her out and she didnt mention shes on her period
Do a colab with the sideman pls
Fun fact corn is a fruit
we need more of cold ones and the boys!!!!!!
Thank you
Lmao bro best collab
I think my mom is suicidal she wouldn't let me buy it 🥲
DIDNT the misfits dare you to do the dyed milk challenge or something ??
to late my mom dead
This is giving me hair cake nostalgia
Juicy is possessed by a goat 🐐 🐐
Haha 🤣
The content of this video reminds me filthyfrank with his ex best friends
@mrbeast is crying
Josh didn't have any time today
Imagine their threat about our mom dying was real lol  I would be an orphan then...  fun
😮😁😁
Hahahaha so funny
Well then, I'd never heard of Cold Ones despite watching a whole lot of Hot Ones.  So they just got another sub.
I can’t believe the boys collided with Max mofo Pokémon
commen cold one and boys W
My dad was in the navy back in the 80s. His ship went to the western part of Australia. While there, he and some other sailors found a Mexican restaurant and tried it. He said it was the nastiest Mexican food he ever had. So my dad can agree with Eddie  that that is not Mexican food. Fyi, my dad and family is white and even we can recognize good Mexican food.
My only complaint is all the camera movement makes me nauseous. Otherwise I loved it! ❤
Mully is SCUFFED for that shit😆😆😆💀
Yet another reason on why transitioning into a woman will make this world better, I dont have to be associated with these fucks
What you ganna say about poor people?!?!  🥲
Maxmoefoe is so funny, glad you guys did a collab
Finally!¡
I never expected this this is amazing 😮
Cold ones  What can you say about poor people huh?  The poor people watching this: c'mon just say it we are waiting
it wasn't a good idea watching while eating 😀
So happy to finally see Mully and Australian Mully together ❤️
There ain’t never gonna be a lettuce shortage in the US
Here is an idea eat worst rated restaurant food vs homemade food to see which one is better.
THE MEME EATING CRAYONS
Chad telling mully I worry about your mental health while sitting next to Juicy who's been covered in cheese and butter and sprinkles 😂 maybe PB&J next and trapped in the troll hole
The nachos weren't good because it's nacho cheese
This is literally where you watch Food Porn
There's gonna be Mully and Chad fan fics now aren't there
E
this is the best collab ever created
Anyone think they should review the highest rated restaurants or just a fancy five star restaurant?
Jokes on you my moms already dead
THE BOYS WITH MAXMOEFOES THE LEGENDS ARE HERE!
“Your the only Mexico in Australia” -Josh
Awesome 👏
Who is the ugly guy
Not juicy getting sexual with the corn😂
finally
MeganTheeStallion be like: 15:49
And all of the boy don’t have shoes or socks on sad
What did juice grab 29:09
finally 😫😫😫i’ve been waiting for this
Me just realizing Josh has no shoes or socks on
I love how the boys reunited and started to eat garbage and be sus at the same time amazing 🤩🤩
The boys you should make a amungus video
Those yellow fries look my school lunch fries
I love how the boys and Cold ones are the most calm then we have narrator looking like he finna puke his guts out
my birthday is on october 7th
I had to eat my dinner whilst watching this... I am no longer hungry.
gabby needs to step it up
Balls in jaws, thoughts?
Was that markiplier they were holding in their promo? 😂😂
I’m sooo happpy it’s the collab we all are happy with and needed
Juicy’s squidward joke didn’t get the love it deserved
I wish I could get it (the jacket)
yooooooooooooooooooooooooo
i have been watching before the begning of the boys channal and cant go to pax met but i just want to say thank you so so much for the great ride and i know you probly wont see this but i love you all - jack
You know it’s bad when Eddie’s gagging. He can handle most of the weird crap they eat😂
1001
People that don't know about the crab: 🤠🤠 People that know about the crab: 😖😖
NO FUCKING WAY!!! YES BABY !!! I'M CRYING THIS IS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE!!! 😭😭😭 I never saw this collaboration coming so freaking EPIC!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊
"is it good?" "It's not mexican!"  Wat
Let’s fucking goooooo!!!
OKAY, i love that the boys have painted nails
THE GIRLS NEEDS TO DO THIS!!!!!
Ha! jokes on you my mom is already dead (im gonna buy it but still)
WHAT A W COLLAB
Lol, happy place, happy place
i think that u need to know that on the last day of school for term 3 i did a shoey with pepsi
Honestly you can't go too wrong with potato cakes (fritters/scallops). But they really tried their best.
The Boys meet The Boys? The real question is ARE YOU BETTER!!!!??
How to get food poisoning: watch this video
Real old oil = yellow chips
This collab is just a match made in heaven
Just bought the hoodie 30 seconds ago
maxmoefoe

All my favs in a video together 😭❤️
Yo Why am i hard?
This is my favorite and best YouTube collaboration to ever be created!! I’ve been laughing my soul outta my body watching max open Pokémon packs for years!!! And been doing the same watching josh/Molly og VR vids evolve into the boys!! So this collab is absolutely LEGENDARY!!!
@mrbeast they like it
its dim sum not dim sim
Holy God those 2 are annoying .
more content with the cold ones and the boys please
I wish the boys could do like try not to make each other laugh like one of them  has their mouth full of water and the rest try to make that person laugh. Look I'm trying okay, that's the best way I can explain it.  .... . .-.. .--.
Y’all should try pepperoni rolls if you can find them. They’re really fucking good.
Do more collabs with cold ones
Why do I love seeing vegans look at a steak as you eat it infornt of them.
7:58 WHO HOLDS A BURGER LIKE THAT
Every time I eat something and watch a boys video I know I’ve made a huge mistake.
This reminds me of me and my buddies middle school cafeteria days.
mully and chad look like cousins
FINALLY. Knew this was gonna eventually be a collab.
I love max and chad!! What a callab lol
Bro the dude looks like bray Wyatt from wwe XD
Go to a haunted asylum with them
I knew that was gonna happen because I saw anythingforviews was in the house party
Lets go more food poisoning with the boys yet again
All the other boys: rates the actual food.   Juicy: rates the paper packaging.
Wow u guys did it u made me throw up some how
Juicy was extra juicy today.  Mully had rape vibes with his food feeding.  And the vegetarian was super, excited about eating Eddie's fingers.  There was a lot to unpack.   Just like yer mom.
Why I’m watching this while I’m eating🤣🤣🤣🤣
25:05🥰
Owner:  Yes we sell a variety of Mexican food  Customer: cool what's there  Owner: burrito
Hairy dwarf thrown through a table and proceeds to recite “oh no, our table it’s broken.”  While having the stance of a hungry Vietnamese midget with his peculiar dogs out in the wind.
Max was reliving his filthy frank PTSD through this video
Yea yes
I love how Eddie played off shoving that fucking Gyro in Josh's face as "you went for it" BITCH! You shoved it in his face after he did it!
Can we all agree that like all of them are not 100% straight like they might be like 78%
The boys videos literally make my day better bro
Just Josh being juicys dad lmfao
OH MY GOD A COLLABBB
atleast finger the guac with the middle and ring finger like a proper finger bang cmon
Best collab I’ve seen in a while
As someone that likes these types of foods, this looks gross.
Grog master chad turns Mexican and rubs toes in potato cake oil.
I think that's French accent
I need this
Aaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Mully. Why? Why?
Narrator being racist to my Mexican Ancestors to my family and my Mexican country🤬🤬🤬 Im Mexican American but agree with Eddie🤠🤠🤠 how could you narrator i seen your good videos and shout out to Mully i hate poor people
I wanted the hoodie but 80 bucks hellllll no ill make my own
Human cake was definitely and still is the disgusting video then this one
Max and Chad feel like they've always been there, they were just edited out in post for every other video.
Josh needs to take that chokeslam through the table better
LETS CLAP FOR JOSH NOT GAGGING!!!!
Hehehe
I'm sooooo glad I wasn't eating while watching this  😂😂😂🤢
Tell @eddievr that forbidden green card is mine 🖕
It corn
They experience worse than that food they eat
Cold once are so familiar 😕
As a British person... the fish and chips disrespected me and I feel offended.
this is the best crossover of all time.
the boys play mini golf
Maybe you guys could play some games, too. (And resurrect Max's dead gaming channel)
I saw the girls going to PAX but I didnt see the boys?
When narrator gagged it reminded me of that one meme of the gagging cat lmao
*72 HOURS ONLY!!!!* >>> THEBOYS.STORE <<< GET IT NOW!!!
Pussy like the first food bro octopus is bossing no cap
Hii
Ydududhdjffjhf
Best video best creators fastest like I've ever done
Josh and Gaege sitting at the end are my last brain cells
Sea food is not Mexican food it is Japanese you Mexican stole the food from America  America was founded before Mexico
Chad and juicy have the same energy
Eddie and narrator are learning to only wear plain shirts to these things
I just went through a hurricane I want it so bad tho 😂
Why did Juicy actually look ready to throw hands with Eddie
They’ve never seen a Florida man until they met juicy
The food reviews are always hilarious but make me nauseous lol
This is what the last supper would have looked like in 2022
Those fries form together like my school brownie 🤨
There all not wearing socks ?
Day 1:eat the largest burger
My favorite creators All together 😢
at 22:18 in the video made me laugh so hard bro xd
I love how they treat Max like a disabled kid
I wanna rub my 🐓 on it also
❤
3:50 I might through up
I never expected this Collab but here I am , and it's a good one
Why the fuck it’s the merch $80
Finally the collab
Max has toned down a fair bit since doing the 2L milk challenges 😂😂😂😂
Narrator can’t say crap about anything. Man wines about everything. Must be army strong huh???? Hahahah
2 decaded of the boys but  where papa frank
Not the octopussy!
I discovered cold ones not too long ago and I was thinking about how they should collab with the boys. I basically manifested it
I regret clicking this video while eating
Could you not get the hot ones on?
The energy this collab brings 😂
Chad and Mully kind of sound the same
THIS IS THE COLLAB WE ASKED FOR WE WNATED AND WE ARE SO HAPOY IT HAPPEND!
I like how Narrator starts to gag before he’s even started chewing.
Vid idea: the boys eat the best Mexican food
Vid idea: the boys eat the best Mexican food
is this bad that this made me hungry 😳
Wtf! I would have never expected this fuckin collaboration this is fuckin insane
Bro i fr expected them to put their feet into eachothers mouth... Im worried about the next one 😭
This is the collab everyone wanted and needed
Masterpiece
The crossover we've all been waiting for!!!!
mully that was gross
Why does max look like a bootleg narrator and chad look like A bootleg juicy
Max was traumatized from Hair Cake and turned Vegetarian.
The wrap seems. *Smacks lips* 💦 *MOIST!!!* 💦 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love this!
The Amy Schumer joke lmfao
I love this lol narrator is halarious 🤣
Fucking Discusting
Mr beast just watches this and be like fuck you too
even max and chad were surprised of Juicy's chaotic nature.
"Cold Ones" should be "worst ones"
Max literally saying ew to an octopus when literally he ate slime, fanta with glue, and a carbonated raw egg with glue
I love how narrator gags but we have to know that some of the things in had in the army was worse then this.
No joke those burgers look much better than the burgers at my school The burgers in my school are more dry in the African desert
This is like both of my worlds colliding
Dude I'm so happy rn both of my favorite  yt channels are collabing. My proudest tug
Chad: I worry about your mental health.  Mully: Me Too   Me: Me three. Oh wait there talking about Mully not me😅
Give me more
i needed this
When i clicked i thought it was the cold ones channel not the boys
Who is this guy that's somehow "joined" the boys...... He's so annoying 🙄
If you don’t like seafood, you are trash human being
26:27 LMFAOAOA THAT SOUNDED LIKE A FUCKING PIG ☠️☠️☠️
Who is that in the middle?
Ya know it hilarious that these companies that rated one star are better at making burgers that a restaurant literally named beast burger
Did anyone else notice that Narrator said WE’RE okay, bro got venom inside of him
The girls and boys review different type of alcohol 👀👀
Narrator forgot his Tabasco
Would of bee better without the other 2 clowns
Not me discovers that he is holding a cardboard figure of Markiplier 8:32  me: 0_0 wt*
you all should come to the UK even tho i am 15 i will tour you around the best places but you all should try our fish and chips the British are the only ones that can make a good fish and chips
I can already see the new fan fiction
Food review with 'The Girls' when
Narrator at 22:01 with that guac guac 9000 with the suction cup
Ok, I can’t be the only one who is saying to themselves, “In The Boys TV show The Deep eats an octopus, and now The Boys from YouTube eat an octopus” 😂
Someone should make an anime aboit juicys last 2 brain cells going to war against each other like 1 brain cell is actually smart and he's the good brain cell and the other is evil and dumb as shit and he's always finding a way to beat the smart brain cell in the dumbest ways possible so the dumb brain cell always gets through to juicy hence why he's always acting dumb as shit all the time
we needed this collab
Looking like the last supper over there. Max as Jesus and Mully as Judice
I saw this Collab from a mile away
😂😂😂😂😂😂 bro i love how juicy can eat from the trash and says mmmmm yummy
DAMN $80 okay, i understand is a collab but $80 is alot for a hoodie $60 is more reasonable but $80 damn, too much for a hoodie
WHO da fuck is that MF’er 😂 first impression
Way to make @YourNarrator miss MRE lol
Eddie was so quite
Chad and Juicy have the same energy. It’s wonderful.
I’m eating food why y’all eat and I almost threw up from this video😅
AHHH MY GLOUSSES I CONT SEEH
Wait.. did seriously nobody realized that eddie got his eye patch off?! (And also i think it was in a video but i didn't see it)
Yep
Yes!!!! if only Papa Franku was there. That would have been the cherry on top....i miss him
“You are the only Mexico in Australia” 💀
im so proud that they are supporting local small businesses  {this is a joke}
Always a treat when you guys upload
Ok mully is freaking guy dog wtf was that bro God I am visibility cringeing
U need to collaborate with Gordon Ramsay
Narrator gave it away a few videos ago I was excited cause I love cold ones
Finally! Been waiting for this collab for so long
Been waiting for another video of y’all rating food
I’m suprised this didn’t give Max flashbacks to the krabby patty
corn isn't a vegetable, it's a grain
I think narrator would trade any of that food for the worst mre ever made
3:50. How milky got civic again!🤒😆
Mullys the type of person to wash his hands and calls it his monthly shower. That mfr is gross
Foooooooooood
Never would have guessed Chad would be feeding soup in a million years lit
Poor mully
I want the hoodie but I don’t got the money
the best collab ever
This is the best colab
now this is a certified epic moment
I hope Gabby didn't watch this
i never knew i would live to witness the legacy..of eddie getting finger eaten 😅😅
Never eat while watching them eat....
Dutch chips are always very yellow
Is that maxmowfoe?
Chad just went: ah yeah 'merica
Mully is fucking vile as always and it hasnt even been 5 minutes
“I’m worried abt your mental health” “ me too”        Same mully same
I'm so fanboying right now two of my favorite channels teaming up to do the greatest thing of all 😁 FOOD 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
The US of A will come for the first restaurant due to how much oil it has
No I've been waiting for this video since y'all had that party and said that you just got done filming with Max and them for cold ones and ever since then I've been waiting and now we finally have it yeah yeah yeah
I don’t have the money for the hoodie :(. It looks soo awesome! Really would like one
Tbh the intro reminded me of those videos you would make in 2007 and stumbled upon them years later lol
12:38 They clearly don't know Juicy lmao
ALL THE TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT!!  WTF
08:50 That’s a wrap, boys!
How they know what a jock strap taste like?????😂😂😂
Who the heck is the cold
I've gotten food like that and threw it back at the peron
Colabing with a vegan didnt kniw the boys where capable of this
Narrator`s nails are ✨fabulous✨
These groups should merge
I had a dream of watching this a month before it was even uploaded
no one needed the cold ones
I just ate 😂🤢
Jokes on you my mom died in 2013
The collab everybody wanted
My two favorite YT channels in one video?? Mully and chad belong together
How fast Mully said “no it’s not” got me for a solid 5 minutes.
Hi
i wanted to vomit
Is that Max Mofo Pokémon? It sounds like him and looks like him is it him
Bought the hoodie,
YOOOOOOO THE BOYS
The crossover I’ve been waiting for never thought it would happen
Who the hell are the cold ones never heard of them
This is the crossover I’ve always wanted
I swear, the camera swinging constantly is gonna give the cameraman CTE... Or does he already have CTE and is a bit "special"?
The camera movement in this makes me nauseous bro
sidenmen colaeb
I have been waiting for this and it’s finally here🎉😂
Narrator, racisst, gone sexual?
YESSSS FINNALLYY EPISODE 3!!!! I WAS REWATCHING THE OTHER ONES AND IT WAS SO FOuouNNYYYYY

I've been waiting for the collaboration
The guy in the purple shirt sounds like maxmofoepokemon  Edit: holy shit it is.
Hi
🎉
Gonna watch this while I make dinner so I feel better about myself
Mexican grandmas always put a hair in their food makes it fire
Why do you guys hate mr beast so much
Thought it as Barbara from Stranger Things S1
the rap at 8:59 it called suvlacy and it a type of rap with pitter bread and usely not raped well so it suposed to be like that
I'm here 😐
Lol
I’m so happy they made this because I thought the original was good And then the one with juicy narrator and Eddie was good so this is amazing
Why was Max here when he's barely participating lol
Why does the merch cost so much the new hoodie cost like $80
Someone is missing here, wish he showed up with a pink costume.
Got my membership back finally
Max is looking like he's going to through up but let me remind you of the hair cake
I saw the thumbnail I came
THAT IS FUNNY
Oh god this video was funny but chaotic 😂
Not Mully getting called out about his hate for poor people less than a minute into the video💀
FINALLY
Yeet
Boys when is fan fics 6 day 34 of asking
I am surprised that Narrator the one who probably had to eat MRE for years reacts this much.
Me when 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Im the 648th commenter
Just discovered this group thanks to Max and Chad. This content seems solid, the personalities really sell it. Subbed
My 2 absolute favorite YouTube channels collabing finally!?! 100% bought the hoodie. Well my BF did, for our anniversary ❤❤❤ I’m so fukkin stoked!
This video was hilarious 😂
Lol this is gross...but, I can't stop watching. 😂
Is no one gonna notice in one of the merch ads chad was holding a markiplier cut out
my goofy ahh guestions myself everytime i watch you guys when im eating
Why did they have jack in hand
Juicy lubing that cob up😏
Next testing a 1 star restaurant and then a 5 star restaurant of the ame brand like a 1 star Mcdonalds vs a 5 star Mcdonalds
I remember that guy making vids with idubz and filthy frank😭, the good old days
Max looks like Sean Schemmel the English voice actor of Goku. 🐸
Dude that is greek food and I'm from greece the unwrapped one was gyros the favorite food of greek people
👍 great vid
all we needed was this, and only two people were missing from this video.
Ayeee wassupbruh
The second restaurant put a tortilla on a dish and called it mexican 😂😂
sickk
i love the jacket at the beginning. i really wish i had money to buy it. even now i wish i had money
You should try Honduran food  I want you to try it because that's where I am from so please try it
Hey are you going to do the brushes again please get some ideas to do the brushes 3D again
Dang I’m pretty early but I’m broke So I can’t buy it
Omg i can almost smell it from here
Maxmoefoepokemon
Two of my favorite channels. I wish there was more of these
I’m now going to go and beg for your merch lmao
this video is the definition of FOUL
The Boys with The ORIGINAL Boys aka The boys with filthyfrank idubzz maxmoefoe and chad
Simpson's more like dimpson's
I'm CORN-y right now.               Please laugh
Yes……..just yes.
ඩා
this video alone jus made my whole day
We need a collab between the boys hasbulla and lazarbeam and between you and me i just want to see lanan getting beat up by hasbulla
damn im sitting here with some hot coco infront of a fire  and watching the BOYS! Les gooooooooooooooooooooooo
Hay jos  ya cohlab with col 1
Hey guys is this corn😂😂
nice
I can guarantee prison food is way worse, it's so bland, we would have been exited getting this food.
i ask my mom if i could buy one so we are not poor and she said we cant afford it because we are poor  im crying XDDD
Now we need the boys,the cold ones, and the hot ones
Never had sour cream on Elote before 🌽
I hate how Narrator always wusses out and never really tries anything
Narrators taste buds are so sensitive it’s hilarious
I was eating. Was
< 3
i challenge the boys to go one food review without feeding each other or wearing the food
Yay I'm the 7th thousandth like.
Maxmoefoe went from eating human cake to straight vegetarian  What a character arc
I just finished a Cold Ones video and what a whiplash this one is! Two Aussie Legends in one vid! The crossover of a century!!!
You guys should do a spicy vs sour food for your next boys video
It was a mistake bringing a vegetarian to a fuckin Boys shoot
I'm dead I can't stop laughing 😭😭🤣🤣
MRE's taste bad.... so the fact that narrator gags means it's even worse
you guys gotta make a video where eddies mom make them actual mexican food like some birria  some quesadilla's withe barbacoa some stuff like that
Pov: the kids in the back of the class
juicy is being juicy
I would have bought the hoodie but you guys dont have Klarna as a payment option, you should add it just saying ❤ Id love to buy all kinds of stuff from your store but i sont have the money to pay it all at once 😭💔
Cool
Man these Boys videos have gone in to a decline as of late..  they have turned from entertaining to fully random and annoying. Lately it appears they are struggling for content and will just do about anything to just get viewers
Internet challenge?
Damn it you guys make me want hamburbur
2 of my favorite channels! Definitely buying that new merch
oioioio
Funny
Hi
Its crazy how this got this many views and like in 59 min1
Chad and mully are soulmates
No filthy frank :(
Lets go
hello fight eachother
Yo narrators face just wants to collapse in on itself  when he tries anything gross
This collab is amazing and the new merch of the boys looks really cool
I've never been so simultaneously disgusted and amused at a video lmfao
BRO NO FUCKING WAY 2 OF MY FAVORITE YOUTUBE CHANNELS
He sounded like he was trying to b Japanese not Spanish lol
STOP MOVING THE CAMERA SO F$&KING MUCH! ITS SO OVERDONE AND UNNECESSARY! Keep it in one place for more than half a second. It doesn’t make the algorithm have an orgasm or anything it just makes the video into nothing but listening to words because you can’t see a single view long enough to stay engaged.
epic video collab was so cool
The Boys x The Cold Ones, one of the best collab ever known
YES FUCKINH FINALLY
Made my day :)
The chips will b yellow because they coated it in chip batter
I’m early
Do tis again with those guy was funny as hell 😂😂😂
When you want but are to young to get:
Mr beast is typing…
The Boys and Cold Ones in the same video!? Dreams do come true!!!
Haha
Please review Honduran or Salvadoran food please I am from Honduras and I wanna  see if you like it
:)
16:56-16:57
Ladies and gentlemen: the cold boys….          Or the ones…. You tell me which is better.
E

Josh went in it so fast
IS THAT MY 2 FAVORITE GROUPS COLLABING????
When are The Boys going to collab with the Goons?
Not that early
MAXMOE FOE?

Just like mrbeast and coryxkenshin mully gonna be abused for forcing meat in a vegans face
Yo, the guy with the beard from the cold ones,why does he look like he's from a old tvfiltyfrank video ? Bruh 🗿
The boys never disappoints me
its a great day to watch the boys videos
i honestly would have never expected my 2 favorite youtubers to collab and its the best thing that has happened to YouTube
Bro now you need to collab with swagger and the misfits
Dutlniv tioogattlyg

I bought this hoodie and my mom died
Why my stomy hurt😢
500th comment
11:51 certified Junji Ito moment
It's always nice to see the boys with special needs colabed with "professionals"
Who is the viking and the  nerd
Lol mully has to be the most disgusting out of the boys, even juicy.
Eddie: “yeah I’ll bless him.” Starts throwing food at juicy and talking in Spanish  Juicy try’s to stop Eddie and some how ends up just falling on the table 😂 for all you wonder were it is here is the time stamp 29:02
Later on the Boys would end up doing a WWE Wrestling video
I’m finally early
hola
Yo
When feeding someone is your love language
Fuck yes ive been waiting for this collab
best fucking collab
The one collab I’ve prayed for. But never thought would happen
The best Collab everyone has been waiting for..
Mully was dead silent the whole video unless he was bullying someone lol
i would like Gordon Ramsey to try this
The boys : NARRATOR!!! NARRATOR!!! x10  Narrator : 😀🖕😀🖕😀🖕

Welcome to the men. Welcome to the men, Welcome to the men
juicy is getting more aids🥶😓
Can we get a video where the Boyz play with knives?
Mully: if you don’t buy it I will come to you’re house and beat you’re mom  Me: okay that’s not a problem I mean it’s just normal for mully so ok
So we need more of this???? Or is it just me 😂
We were on such a good streak of videos without pukeing, what happened boys?
damn im eating it
match made in heaven
Max: puts Eddie's finger I his mouth Mully: are you gay ?! 🤨
Yes finally the collab of my two favorite channels
Soon as they said that guys vegetarian I clicked off if you don't eat meat gfto this world pussy
𝙵𝚄𝙲𝙺 𝚈𝙴𝙰𝙷
10:21 bruh what's he doing already and then Josh got sneezing Lol
The collab is cool but if I see Eddie or Mully Force feeding other people or smothering the food and other people's face I'm gonna unsubscribe, They both act like babies from the food everywhere and making a mess
Throws it across the room "It's barely even wrapped!" Yeah that kind of happens when you use it as a Frisby.
honestly this is the best collaboration ever. Cold ones and the boys are the most ironic shit I have ever watch. thank you for making me laugh every fucking day.
Shit was mad funny 🤣🤣🤣
