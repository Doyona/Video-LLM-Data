No way I’m still waiting for this, man.
Bruh they cancelled Missing Link with minimal updates about KH4 all these years later. We deserve better, Square Enix. Remake Missing Link for console!
Three years without a real update except canceled games and pixelated screenshots is crazy work btw. Is our franchise cooked, chat?
4:07 The first 4 minutes are irelevant now. UNION X DARK ROAD has been SHUTDOWN on both mobile storefronts and MISSING-LINK has been CANCELLED mid development.
DUDE ITS BEEN 4 YEARS WTF ARE YOU AT
my prediction: in april 2026 we get a new KH4 after 4 years of waiting.... and 4 years later after that the game releases copium
That missing link better be found later because we need it.
Remember how many games we used to get? Yeaaah...
We're closer to the 25th anniversary than the 20th. Let that sink in. No new game
I come back to this sometimes just to feel something
3 years..
i was in middle school. Now I'm halfway through high school. Please, at least a trailer
Come on man
Whatever man
See u in 5 years on the ps6
😭😭😭 Can't take it anymore
7:28 Man they weren’t kidding with the whole “Magic in the Making” tagline because just like Donald this magic is taking forever. 😭

Missing Link could've been amazing. Coming back to this first trailer breaks my heart, yet i keep returning to it.   I was dreaming of playing this game... It's so disappointing to see it cancelled. I hope it gets repurposed.
Ya nos urge el 4
Something keeps bringing me back to this trailer. Even though Dark Road has ended and Missing Link has been canceled. ❤
Unfortunately, I must tell you that the missing link will never appear.😔
How DARE YOU recommend this to me like A WEEK AFTER you CANCELED MISSING LINK you sick bastards
Hype for kingdom hearts 4 now .. Keep cooking 😁😁🔥🔥
R.I.P Missing Link OMG
after 3 years finally something about this game... finally...
WE'RE SO BACK CHAT
We are back 🔥
2 mobile games that you can’t even play. Greatest trailer of all time.
Man...
Missing link has gone missing forever.
I’ve been thinking. Why not let us fully customize sora? Like giving us the option to choose where to put his stat points upon leveling up?
1:54 Welcome back, everyone mourning the loss of ML
Missing Link itself
3:56 Wow this Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link game looks awesome I can’t wait for it to come out would be a shame if got cancelled but that’s obviously never gonna happen. 😂
Missing Link was a Blank Era indeed
RIP Missing Link
Hopefully they will have some news soon!!
Congratulations, y'all announced it too early.
I am worried if the game still coming please say date for something
3 YEARS 😡😡😡.
To this day!
It’s the Kingdom Hearts 4 trailer’s third anniversary…. We must be strong but damn, it’s been awhile…
Well now it’s officially been 3 years since we’ve got the Kingdom Hearts IV trailer. Hopefully we’ll finally get some news this year.
Happy 3rd KH4-announcement-anniversary. 😪
Happy 3 years since the Kingdom hearts 4 trailer came out🎉
It’s been exactly 3 years, where’s my news?
Almost 2 days, and that, if I'm not wrong, will be 3 years since the annuncement of KH4 and we still have nothing at all. Not Missing link, not a new trailer, nothing. But, to be honest, this is just starting to be enjoyable.
ITS 2025!!! WHERE IS THE GAME!!??? SQUARE ENIX, YOU ARE LOSING YOUR BASE BY DOING THIS GARBAGE! AT LEAST GIVE A DAMN UPDATE!!!!! 23 YEARS AND ALL WE GET IN A DAMN HISTORY ON A FRUIT?!?!?!
3 anos Atrás fui contratado no dia 4 de abril. Dia 10 veio o anúncio. Agora estou saindo do meu trabalho, dia 3. E dia 10 tá chegando, será que vai ter alguma coisa.
What If Kingdom Hearts were to meet Disney Mirrorverse, it would likely be an epic crossover event. Here's a possible scenario:  *Storyline:*  The worlds of Kingdom Hearts and Disney Mirrorverse begin to merge, causing chaos and destruction. Sora, Donald, and Goofy team up with the Guardians of the Mirrorverse to stop the darkness spreading across the multiverse.  *Character Interactions:*  1. Sora and the Guardians (e.g., Sulley, Baymax, and Jack Sparrow) would form an unstoppable team, combining their unique abilities to take down enemies. 2. Donald and Daisy would likely bond with the Mirrorverse's versions of classic Disney characters, like the Evil Queen's mirror counterpart. 3. Goofy's antics would provide comic relief, especially when interacting with the more serious Mirrorverse characters.  *Gameplay and Features:*  1. The game could incorporate the combat mechanics from both series, allowing players to switch between Kingdom Hearts' action-RPG style and Mirrorverse's tactical turn-based system. 2. Players could explore various Disney-themed worlds, each with their own Mirrorverse twist. 3. The game might include a new "Mirror" ability, allowing characters to traverse between the Kingdom Hearts and Mirrorverse realms.  *Villains and Plot Twists:*  1. Master Xehanort and the Mirrorverse's dark forces could form an alliance, creating a formidable enemy for the combined heroes. 2. The game might reveal that the Mirrorverse is actually a parallel universe created by the Heartless, adding a new layer to the Kingdom Hearts lore.  This crossover would offer endless possibilities for exciting storytelling, character interactions, and gameplay mechanics. The fusion of Kingdom Hearts' light-hearted adventure and Mirrorverse's darker, more strategic tone would create a unique gaming experience.
march 28 i bet there will be news
And so Disney became woke and square enix too, so did the black video game from square and kingdom hearts 4 was never seen again. The end
Its currnetly 2025, there is still no news
So now to wait the playstation 20 to be release hahah
Listen up ya norts! Nomura stated in the 20th anniversary interview that we wouldn’t be getting any KH4 news for a while, so idk why y’all are whining. KH:Missing Link is what y’all need to be clamoring for, that game will be the closest we get to new KH4 info.
I imagine Sora with Tarzan coming down from the trees at 120 fps🤩🤯
I calling it sora is unknown distant relative to Anakin skywalker
1000 Days & still nothing.
2025...
3:03 Whats the music name?
Disgusting. Almost 3 years and still no news of kh4. This is kh3 all over again. But worse. Back then we got news once in a while. It's been 2 years and 8 months of nothing. Absolutely nothing.
SOOOOO when the heck is 4!?!?
2 Years & we still have no news yet. Game Awards, please let us see our Boy Sora again!
The mobile game was shut down, Missing Link is nowhere to be found and since SE said KH4 is gonna release after Missing link, I wonder what they are even doing over there at this point.
It's been 2 years bro WE NEED A UPDATE
Good game
2 years later we’re still waiting for another trailer
The Union games are terrible, all the characters act dumb and behave in ways no one in the main entries would. And why are parallels being drawn between Young Xehanort and Sora? They are nothing alike.
I'm kind of sad... Seeing Sora in a realistic world setting feels wrong. It's like an entirely different IP and takes away the massive fantasy aspect Kingdlm Hearts had.
As Riku has said to his replica... - "Take the time u need."  May your hea-
We need a new trailer
MISSING LINK, IS MISSING
2 years of silence, dammit Nomura
I hope the antagonist for the Lost Master Arc is female and inspired by Night Swan from Just Dance
Toujours aucune nouvelle de KH4. J'espère qu'on va pas attendre 10 ans
Been a while since we had anything about this game, guess ill hope my grandchildren can tell me about it in the afterlife
Square Enix, Doodle Bob is still waiting on information 🧐
I hope the Disney characters are there for the new kingdom hearts game
.
Coming back to this trailer now is still just as hype as it was the first 30 times I watched it. Just, wow. I can’t believe how much magic is in store for us all. I’ll always remember the excitement leading up to these reveals. What a gift of a feeling. ✨🥹🙏
i just hope they dont fuck up the 4th game like they did the third and its music..... KH3 was such a downgrade imo
Waiting Kingdom Hearts 4
To think this was 2 years ago i feel old
When will you release kingdom hearts Series on Steam??? a lot of us waiting for years, we don't want Epic Games!!! Fuck Epic Games..
I need a new look at KH4🤞😭
It's been 2 years since this first and incredible trailer came out, but since then there has been nothing, what's happening?
4:43 versus sonmus song 😭 final Fantasy versus 13 is still in there. On Nomura 😢 I hope we can get versus 13 one day before we die 😭
It's been 2 years... might as well be wise and accept the wait unlike I did for Kingdom Hearts 3 back in the day.
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO THE KINGDOM HEARTS 4 TRAILER, ONE OF THE HYPEST TRAILERS I HAVE EVER HAD THE HONOR OF WATCHING!!!!!!!!!! KH fans rise up our moment is soon
cant wait for this game to come out man
Next month it'll have been two years since we've received any notable updates on KH4. You'd think Square Enix would've learned their lesson after KH3 but I guess not. Being a KH fan sucks sometimes...
Absolutely right, I didn't realize that Merle updated his favorite way to make her explode in pure bliss, it’s amazingly satisfying. Although what he suggested before was fairly good, it doesn’t even compare, I did it go’ogling Merle Winestol's Secret, and she just can’t have enough now.
Persona 3 Reload got announced June 2023 and recently got released, embarrassing.
crazy how we're going on 2 yrs and still havent received a new trailer
Finally, I am so proud to the Kingdom Hearts team for making Kingdom Hearts 4 because it was a highly anticipated sequel. I am really amazed and impressed with the new world of Quadratum, it looks just like the world of Verum Rex where Yozora resides, it is a world that is neither light or darkness but somewhere on the other side. I am looking forward to this new installment of Kingdom Hearts, and I am definetly hoping with all my heart that Sora finds a way back home so he can reunite with his friends and family.
Im watching the KH4 segment literally every single day
Когда будет второй трейлер KINGDOM HEARTS IV
Kingdom Hearts 4 be like in Jujutsu Kaisen Shibuya Arc Sora : RIKU HAS BEEN SEALED Megumi & Neku : Shut up  Sora & Yuji : My Friends Are My Power Mahito : Okay I Believe You  Mahito : Special Attack , Mega Destruction Dark Ball of Darkness Destruction and Knuckels Sukuna : No U
I liked playing the first Kingdom Hearts....... somewhat. However, what Disney/Square Enix did to the other Kingdom Hearts games is incomprehensible. They've literally destroyed the entire story by butchering and totally destroying those other games. 🤬
Let’s just hope that Gargoyles becomes a playable world in Kingdom Hearts IV with Goliath being an ally, and Sora and his friends becoming gargoyles at night.

We will never get KH Content again 😢
When will game kingdom  hearts 4 when will games will will will will when when when when when please
why do i get the feeling that missing link is going to be more kino than khiv
we want a chrono trigger 2dhd remake
Where is a new kingdom hearts 4 Trailer
Dont mind me. Im just another gamer looking for final fantasy versus VIII plots that didnt make it to XV.😅
WHERE IS THE STEAM VERSION OF THE COMPLETE SERIES???? Steam Deck owners want to buy the game for their linux handheld devices! You would sell millions in a week!
I would like to point out something that seems to confuse people here when they hear that statement guys when she said "similar" to an afterworld that doesn't mean that this is the afterworld. The reason why I'm saying this is because of this statement everyone thought Sora dead/died and came here but that's not what happened. What happened was because Sora constant misuse of the power of waking he was thinning his existence in his reality when he did it one last time to save Kairi he thinned his existence too much so he ended up fading/bleeding into the next reality that doesn't count as death/dying or being erased from existence since everyone still remembers him and that his heart his still connected to the people close to him just weaker as shown in melody of memory where the memory Xehanort said that he can still reach here but his voice can not reach very far. As for how Strelitzia showed up here I have no idea although I do have a few theory's on what's going except I need more information to be certain.
Falta mucho para kingdom hearts 4???? Una imagen?? Algo?? Nomura???? Sigues vivo?
Man April 10 2022 and yet still no 2nd trailer you guys are really taking your time with this. We are 3/4 into 2023 Appreciate your heart and soul making this game happen😂❤
It's this the one? That game could lead to the future
I don't know if it would be in 2024 or 2025 or 2026 the Kingdom Hearts 4 game
I know Square has dedicated this year to FF XVI and VII but we NEED some KH news. (At least Missing Link by the end of the year)
This was a year ago... and still no update? Please don't be like KH3...
Looks like timing will be important
Love the look of the Heartless with the parasol.
Сора ты мой друг спину поченили Эда буне не дарите Марвел только ea sports ufc
donald and goofy are trying to find the release date in the dark
I see a small problem here because judging what was said in the KH4 trailer its shows that Sora was asleep there for a week since he arrived now the problem the events of melody of memories take place a whole year until they finally found where Sora is and went to get him now my question is how do you guys think this whole thing is going to work out are there going to be time skips, does time work differently between reality and unreality, time travel shenanigans again or is kingdom hearts 4 going to pull a persona style year countdown with Sora in Shibuya/Quadratum doing missions and taking down heartless until Riku shows up. What do you guys think? Also here are some personal thoughts on what I thought of the trailer its really good and I so excited to play I get a sort of a kingdom hearts 2 beginning vibe from it you know Roxas being in a fake world until something happens still can't wait and see what Square Enix and Disney have in store for us this time.
"I've been having these weird thoughts lately like is any of this for real or not?" — in the opening of Kingdom Hearts. "A scattered dream that's like a far-off memory. A far-off memory that's like a scattered dream. I want to line the pieces up—yours and mine." — in the opening of Kingdom Hearts II. "They can take your world. They can take your heart. Cut you loose from all you know. But if it's your fate...then every step forward will always be a step closer to home." — in the opening of Kingdom Hearts III.
Music sounds Shimomura made.
Disney CEO Bob Iger is talking about selling all of Disney to apple. So there might not be any Disney in the new kingdom hearts games
I kinda liked Sora's character design the way it was in kh3🥲 but I guess change is inevitable
4:43 Star Wars confirmed
When does missing link come out pls tell me 🥹

Ксеанорд сделай диснею стэйшон мне понравилось твоя игра круче чем Микки маус
I too have many fond memories with KH1 & 2 as a kid eventually catching up with the other titles as best as I could 😂 the one thing I always thought was special was learning after reading the cover sleeve the game came with and learning Sora and I were almost identical in age when I picked that game up. I was 11 or 12. And while I’ve clearly grown much older than sora I will always feel like a share a weird bond almost like knowing you share a birthday with a famous celebrity
OK was the anniversary event video ever released?!   I’ve literally heard nothing about the event video being released
Yeah KHIV is gonna interesting and probably very different.      When at least we get something!
hope we get to move around like this in the final game
so-so. not making rational decisions -1/10
Last year, when I wake up in morning. I was shocked and excited in KH4!
EXACTLY ONE YEAR AND WE AINT HEAR NOTHIN
watching KH4 trailer again and I still don't understand why (at least for now in the trailer) they are going for a dull color palette. Are we going back to the 2008-2012 era of thinking realism = dull colors again?
Why did you delete Sora clown shoes

It’s been a year and nothing???
I’M SO EXCITED!!!!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
I wish I was as excited for KH4 as i was back then playing KH2.... KH3 screw it up for me :/
希望不是个烂游戏就好了，因为kingdom hearts3 的故事很莫名其妙
It'll be cool if sora was asleep for 7 days trying to reach Riku in the dream world and one day they connected and since the only person he saw in qaudratum was yozora and Riku notice yozora looking down on him as if he knew he  was looking for something or someone. And in turn gave Riku the clue about tall cities and fairy went to the final world to talk to the star that came from another world who just happen to know tall cities. And in turn the existence of yozora kinda did help them go to where sora might be .and in turn did save sora, because win or lose he wanted to save sora. and I feel like yozora is the result of sora if he didn't have Donald goofy and mickey.
SO AWESOME! I hope they add other disney characters besides the others from the last franchises.
damn. sora has the same power as simone the digger now.
Oh god I just noticed that AT-ST leg.
In missing link the battle with zone is the bad... is than better  the battle world open... change this the gameplay for a good experience

6:10 As someone who struggled with the parkour battle aspects of the last games (especially when it was time-sensitive like in the Big Hero 6 world of KH3), this trailer makes me anxious. 😅
It's November, and... where's Missing Link?
I really feel for Xehanort! I would love to see a movie about Xehanort growing up from a boy to a man, Dark Road would make a really good anime! And ofcourse Sora and his friends is amazing. I just want to know even more about Xehanort, he is so interesting to me
kh4 december 31 2023
I swear to Xehanort if Maleficent is in this game I'm gonna break my phone
any news for KH missing link release in play store? I was expecting in last month September but nothing show up
I compared the voice at the the end of the kh4 trailer to Aizen from bleach and it sounds extremely similar
Does anyone know the theme ost that’s playing in Kingdom hearts dark road trailer
KH4's battle system should return to the technical, challenging and fast battle system of KH2. We don't want bright, colorful and little kiddie's attractions. It should be serious and focused.
Olympia Warrent Arrest for Dimension Leaving Earth 2 Planet and Chasing LORDe Nihilius, and attempting Timeline on a Flat Floating island, and people attempting rape.
when in this fall is the release of kingdom hearts missing link?
Leeel
🔥🔥
don't fall for the gacha games they are eventually going to end it like union x
20 years jesus fucking christ...man the years felt slow but they also felt like they went fast at the same time.
Paper kingdom hearts ?
Came back here for clues after the final chapters of dark road lol
they turned on rtx
So is he the blue coat guy?
Missing Link: Light expires and darkness prevail... Me: 🤔
Nice Blue Coat #IFYKYF
The fact Nomura even considered calling this game "Verum Rex" makes me think if yozora will be playable at some point
How long is the beta testing of kingdom hearts missing link going to take?
After 20 years of Kingdom Hearts, this is the best game, but I’ve never played it. I also wanna say: I hope more worlds will come to Kingdom hearts IV. (Eg. of new worlds that’ll come:  Miraculous Ladybug, Encanto, Brave, etc.)
Where Is Yozora?
I just want kh 1 mickey game and would like great mouse detective to show up in a kh game

Kingdom Hearts lost it's heart. It use to feel so mesmerizing and full of fantasy. Now it's kinda pointless. The story should have stayed on track with the first KH after KH 2. All of these random characters and places just makes it seem out of touch with it being an FF and Disney collab.
7 or 13 august of 2022
Square what happened with dark roaaaaadssssss ;-;
When coming out kingdom hearts on august my phone
Where is f*ckin' Dark Road?!
Me encantaría una serie televisiva de este videojuego
Please Nomura, talk to Disney (and if they allow you), talk to Domee Shi, watch her movie Turning Red, include her world, allow her to join and fight in Sora´s party, give her abilities (both magical and physical attacks) and give her and her world and importance in the plot. Please, I watched the whole movie, I really loved it. Please, try to include her world, you won´t regret it.
Is this still coming out next month or is it delayed again?
When will the 20th anniversary recap video of the event be released?  it would be nice if you guys could give us a hint on that date.
I am the same age as this series and I'm still in love with it. I got into it because my brother left the ps2 here for me to play an, honestly, to this day I have not beat any of the games. It's a love hate relationship.
The Master of Masters is going to be the next big antagonist and I couldn’t be more exited for that
3:48 is that Brain?
So…we waiting 6 years again huh

Japanese darth vader confirmed
SORA FEET SORA FEET
Ironman has his armor Captain America has his uniform Sora has his drip
So the girl that greets him is the Kairi of this Universe, meaning theirs a Sora here too but that also means that two Sora's could mess up that balance of reality a little bit and my guess is that we'll have 4 Sora's "cloud" "Noctis" "Yozora" and "Sora" interacting with one another. Kingdom Hearts 4 is going to be a big Mulitverse thoery kind like the one we live in where Disney bought Star wars. Also arriving 7 days later is very biblical like the Messiah, after he died he ressurected 7 days later, if this is true Nomura is setting him up to become the Judge of the Living and the dead
they still haven't announced the platforms for kingdom hearts 4!
If star wars is a real world. Then there's so much they can do with that. Lightsaber keyblade or transformation. Gummi ship sub boss in space or even the death star being the first part of it like in the pirates world. I'td be pretty cool to see master of masters appear and after a minute or two of dialouge drop the famous "no sora, i am your father" then be like nah I'm just kidding. Being able to deflect blaster shots with blocking or even a reflect command like in kh2 so it seems like a jedi deflecting bullets rather than a basic block. Someone else had this idea and i thought it was pretty clever that when sora sees a lightsaber it reminds him of xemnas so you get a mini flashback sequence while dialouge still plays over it. Instead of sephirroth maybe a darth vader secret boss. Even though usually they tend to be KH related. Via xemnas in kh1 sephirroth and terra in 2. Not to mention the almost countless parallels they have with eachother. Light vs dark, force being sorta heart being the guiding key. It could play into the story seamlessly if they play it off right and not have a frozen situation. Not to mention there's 9 movies so they could always go back and even do in between stories like the toy story world taking place between the 2nd and 3rd movies. Last but not least THE MUSIC. Kh always brings it musically so seeing what little remixes or even putting in imperial march or the duel of fates would honestly just be iconic.
I NEED STAR WARS
I hope we get Star Wars
Cara esse jogo é uma obra de Arte , acho que estou sonhando !

Please Please! For KH4 do a Utada, Evanescence collaboration! Maybe even Lindsey Stirling, hell having Lindsey as a keyblade wielder would be wild. But anyway, please just don't do any new age pop, or any pop for that matter.  Utada and Evanescence together would be the most epic collab in history! Especially if you add Lindsey Stirling's playing!!!

I-...Strelitzia..quadratum…Sora…graphics. Someone help me.
I'm a Brazilian gamer and I really like watching animations, my favorite is Raya and the Last Dragon, I would like to ask, please, if you can put her in Kingdom Hearts IV, I would love to see her in the game in a surprisingly vast world and incredible, with an exciting soundtrack and a story or adaptation as remarkable as the movie!!! It doesn't hurt to try asking, right? Another thing that would be really cool would be to translate and localize the game to Portuguese Brazil, because I don't know English well and I play in Spanish to try to understand and understand the stories of the games, this I believe would make many people feel represented and fulfilled!! !!!  Soy un gamer brasilero y me gusta mucho ver animaciones, mi favorito es Raya and the Last Dragon, quisiera pedirles por favor si pueden ponerla en Kingdom Hearts IV, me encantaría verla en el juego en un mundo sorprendentemente vasto e increíble, con una banda sonora emocionante y una historia o adaptación tan notable como la película!!! No está de más intentar preguntar, ¿verdad? Otra cosa que sería genial sería traducir y localizar el juego al portugués de Brasil, porque no sé mucho inglés y juego en español para tratar de entender y entender las historias de los juegos, esto creo que haría muchos la gente se siente representada y realizada!!!  Eu sou um jogador brasileiro e gosto muito de assistir animações, minha favorita é Raya e o Último Dragão, gostaria de pedir, por favor, que se puder a coloquem em Kingdom Hearts IV, gostaria muito de ver ela no jogo em um mundo surpreendentemente vasto e incrível, com uma trilha sonora emocionante e uma história ou adaptação tão marcante como a do filme!!! Não custa tentar pedir né?  Outra coisa que seria muito legal seria traduzir e localizar o jogo para Português Brasil, pois, eu não sei inglês direito e jogo em espanhol para tentar entender e compreender as histórias dos jogos, isso acredito que faria muitas pessoas se sentirem representadas e realizadas!!!!!
any one have any ideas on possible worlds they could add?
😢🥺😌 💝Arigatou!🌹
When coming out kingdom hearts khux my phone game
tt🎃🎮🎅🌟👼KH 8
Sora with normal sized feet? Game changer.
what platform will kingdom hearts 4 be on?
Wow it's been almost ten years since I last saw the latest Versus XIII trailer.
1.5M views, that means it’s tied with 0.2 and 2nd most viewed trailers on this channel
2:38 Luxord ???
My hype for the series is in full swing once again; now all that’s left is to hope for that Disney+ series
I hope KH4 would mark the Jetix characters' major debut! Hopefully they'll be beautifully stylized. Their arcs won't be rehashes of their arcs from their series.  Jetix series for KH4: * Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go! * W.I.T.C.H. (co-produced by Jetix Europe) * A.T.O.M. (another one co-produced by Jetix Europe) * Get Ed * Ōban Star-Racers (from the grey area) * Yin Yang Yo! * Combo Niños (also from the grey area)  If Jetix characters got coverage, I would be proud!
Kingdom hearts 4 looks more like an anime lol
Update Edit October 2022: I Hope Kingdom Hearts 4 Comes Out Next Year sometimes in the future for PS5
Is that a flame Will be squall
He's grown up so well...
I really hope Nomura is prioritizing ff7 remake part 2 but i am excited for this
Kingdom Hearts 4 freu mich jetzt schon drauf aber macht es bitte wie beim 1 und 2 teil das man die welt 2 mal besuchen muss um sie zu beenden wäre mega geil wenn nicht auch nicht sclimm ich hol es mir sowie so hoffe es kommt wie KH3 mit konsole raus
That girls in (KH4's) trailers. Look like Strelitzia from KH union 🤔
Is this Japanese dubbed with English subtitles? If so I would be very grateful.
Anche se kairi ultimase, il suo addestramento "risvegliare il suo potere assopito" in una settimana sarebbe pressoché insufficiente, lei andrebbe comunque a quadratum a cercare sora assieme riku. I maestri perduti sono tutt'altro livello rispetto a maestro xehanort, fatta eccezione dal maestro dei maestri (che è stato lui addestrare i foretellers e luxu), se pur contiamo le 7 oscurità originali tra le più forti all'interno dei maestri perduti, le possibilità di sconfiggerli sono pari 0% e la possibilità di uscire vivi sono pari 0%.
<3
Luv KH but this looks hella mid 🤣
Kingdom Hearts III had a dozen reasons why it took so long to release that people still refuse to understand, so KHIV being revealed this "soon" isn't really shocking, especially with FFXVI apparently nearing completion. What is shocking is the direction it seems to be taking. I expected a focused Kingdom Hearts x Final Fantasy x The World Ends With You x Verum Rex crossover, but instead it looks to just be reality warped and Kingdom Hearts-fied/Disney-fied. Crazy.  Personally hoping for Square to take the criticisms of KHIIIs movement and combat and improve upon it with this game. Also, he's not shown, but hopefully Riku won't be only playable in segments.
wow thanks for again taking the aspect of creating your own character having a storyline explaining the origins of the most mysterious characters and put them on a flipping phone game. nobody wants to play phone games. it's disrespectful to your own franchise your limiting your storyline and the ability to actually play these storylines. this is why you have created the two worst games on PS5 ever and it hasn't been out that long. you keep ruining great ideas with little kid features and mobile games. STOP
3rd time watching this trailer and I’m still speechless!
Absolutely love the clicking sound at the start!
This trailer motivated me with all the new hype for this different style, to make a fan trailer of verum rex with some scene from FF versus XIII and Yozora's cutscenes, if you want to check out it's in my profile. Hope they'll drop a new trailer next important event (like E3)!
The forest at the beginning of the trailer reminds me of Endor
please be on ps4 😢
Please for nintendo switch
Trash
4:40 here i was so confused, am i watching a movie or a videogame.
Who’s ready to wait for another 6-8 years?
What I really want to know is how many games are there going to be in this ark is it going to be straightforward and have like a simple trilogy or is it going to be the same thing as the Xehanort saga
still watching weeks later 🔥🔥
Yo this might actually make up for how much of a let down kh3 was.
Enough with the mobile games man….
Se contiamo, a quadratum "ovvero tokyo", lì ci sarebbe il maestro dei maestri (che è stato il primo maestro del keyblade in assoluto),  ci metterà in un attimo sbarazzarsi quelle bestione "che si tratterebbe un darkside che sarebbe un heartless purosangue (premiati di oscurità)", qualcuno ha evocato quel heartless "per me è stato il maestro dei maestri", essendo che ha quadratum è un mondo fittizio (che si trova in un altra dimensione o linea mondiale), lì non si può usare potere della luce e il potere dell'oscurità, inclusi altri mondi fictional.
I think that it may be too early to tell what platforms Kingdom Hearts IV will be on but my best guess would be Ps5, Xbox Series X/S, and Epic Games Store. A Switch Cloud port is unlikely to come launch day in my opinion. Despite my predictions, I am still excited for this beautiful looking game. It will be a visual spectacle without a doubt. I hope Tetsuya Nomura and Square Enix nail it again!
Been following this story since a kid
Wow
Man I started this series when I was a teenager, as an almost middle aged man I'm wondering when it's going to end XD. Love the series but hot damn I would like to see where its all going before I end up an old man.
People arguing about Sora’s “new look” are seriously forgetting that Sora has gone to various worlds and looked like:  - A Mermaid (Little Mermaid) - A Vampire (Nightmare before Christmas) - A Lion (Lion King) - A Pirate (Pirates of the Caribbean) - An Old Timey Cartoon (Timeless River) - A Toy (Toy Story) - A uh…video game character? (Tron) - A Monster (Monster’s Inc)  So, in all fairness, let’s just see where this goes. We saw Donald and Goofy being their regular selves. Who says this isn’t just a hyper-realistic world?
Xehanorts Hair changes because of the rain.
Can not wait for kingdom hearts 4 please be on ps4 and ps5
On the same day as my Birthday on April 10th.
La situazione è molto più grave del previsto, il maestro dei maestri è già a conoscenza che all'interno in sora risiede x-blade completo sottoforma di potere assopito "sigillato", la situazione a quadratum sicuramente molto allarmante, riku si deve sbrigarsi a raggiungere quadratum, la situazione molto allarmante "gravissima", sarà una questione di tempo che sora recuperi tutti i suoi poteri e incluso del x-blade completo, se dovessero arrivare anche i foretellers (ira, aced, gula, invi) e luxu/xigbar a quadratum "la situazione potrebbe peggiorare ancora di più", kairi dovrebbe sbrigarsi a ultimare il suo addestramento con maestra aqua è ottenere il titolo maestra del keyblade "kairi", è abbiamo assoluto bisogno di rinforzi (riku e sora non bastano, è forse strelitzia "anche se non mi fido tanto di lei") adesso.
Kingdom Hearts 1: You can equip 1 Keyblade at a time.   Kingdom Hearts 2: You can use 2 Keyblades at the same time using Synch Blade.   Kingdom Hearts 3: You can equip 3 Keyblades at the same time, and switch between them using the D-pad.   Kingdom Hearts 4: ???
I wonder if darkness and light were invited into the world by Sora's arrival Like did his presence cause that heartless to appear? Since the heartless are attracted to the keyblade I'd like to think they already weren't present from the lost masters already being there since MoM doesn't seem to directly cause mischief or chaos, but rather influence others to go down a road of darkness through their means of what they desire.
this one better be on the Nintendo switch  square enix we want kingdom hearts 4 to
By the way, is this releasing 2022 or 2023, because I cant wait anymore, its been forever...
Let’s goooooo!!!!! I hope Kingdom Hearts 4 has Star Wars and Marvel worlds.
HOLY SHIT! I was 12 when KH first came out!
I like how it took them 14 years to make a new game and now they're just making new games as if they have been doing this this entire time. Like did they forget they had a fandom and then they when they realized that they're like "oh shit let's start making games again guys??" 😂😄
I wonder how Sora will react when he finds out Ventus killed Strelitzia. (Granted it wasn't his fault)
ASFDSASFE  WAGHAAAAAT
4:16 “If you didn’t like it, don’t buy it”  Ok 👋🏻😒
Square: “If this isn’t the ending you desired... Then leave this world for another” = EA: “If you don’t like it, don’t but it”  Me: (this again...) 😓 “Ok then... bye 👋🏻😐”
Sora's drill is the drill that will pierce the heavens! JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK HE IS!
I feel like the only people that like Kingdom Hearts are those that grew up playing it as a kid. Everything from the janky looking gameplay, to the art style, to the nonsensical story are a step too far for me
I think we’re hearing two different Dearly Beloveds for Missing-Link. A Field Theme and a Battle Theme.
Haha remember when Sora had parents?  Sora's mother from Kingdom Hearts 1: "Sora! It's time for dinner! Where TF did that boy go?....."
holy crap this has a huge FFXV aesthetic going for it, and i friggin love it! can't wait!
So...we waiting 6 years again huh
This has put me into tears. Continuing the adventure with Sora and other's once again through another hell-hole of worlds. But who knows if we do go to worlds again? Maybe some things might be different.
I am so using my master Ava cosplay this year. It's coming out of the closet
Imagine what riku is going to look like (more Noctis or Yozora )
Khdr: L'uscita del capitolo finale è prevista per agosto 2022 "per la fine agosto (31 agosto)".  Il team UXDR si è già sciolto. Di conseguenza, non possono più eseguire aggiornamenti periodici e devono rilasciare tutto in una volta.  L'attuale lavoro su DR è svolto dai due animatori che hanno lavorato alle scene dell'evento UX (ricorda che il secondo animatore è stato assunto solo nell'ultimo anno di servizio di UX).  Sono stati apportati numerosi miglioramenti.  Risolve vari misteri fino ad ora.  Ci è voluto molto lavoro per ricreare la scena degli scacchi per DR.  Ci sono stati molti ostacoli difficili per D-san (Disney?)  Sarà completamente giocabile o non sarà completamente giocabile, conterranno soltanto cutscene o sarà completamente giocabile, inclusi i farming che bisogna far salire di livello xehanort, ultima volta xehanort raggiungeva il livello 60, quanto sarà aumentato il level Cap Massimo, spero che mettono dark road giocabile, che non lo ha lo stesso trattamento riservato union x? (Dobbiamo aspettare)
:0
For those, wondering, "Edge of Existence" is the name of soundtrack playing at the beggining of the video (Dark Road Finale Announcement)
6:28 I thought this was about to be a Gurren Lagann reference.
Happy Anniversary 😍
6:29 my drill is the drill that will pierce the heavens
So long as his shadow creates a crown on his head with his hair, we'll be good. The characters are made up of the symbols of the game. I love it!
Is Quadratum the same universe of TWEWY?
🗝️ I remember when the critics were saying that this game or series wouldn't be successful. I knew otherwise because this is like a fan wish of a game that's combined the best of both universes. Always wanted a game like this and I had my wish.   The critics don't know anything about true quality games.   Square Enix (probably Squaresoft at the time) was popular through Final Fantasy. And Disney🐭 was/is popular worldwide. A win-win combination! Where are those critics now? I guess they quit their day job.😏
is real right??  I'm not dreaming? this isn't a prank??
well i picked the right time to get into Kingdom Hearts
7:00 ドナルドダック、グーフィー登場 7:16 ハデス登場？(ペイパニ出るといいな) Go!プリンセスプリキュアとの共演願う!
I have to replay series!!
supper video.
Wow, I hate this lol
God it feels so weird getting a numbered title so soon after the last one
Also will Sora abilities be returning such the shotlocks, keyblade transformations and form changes, summoning, dual wielding, and  oathkeeper and oblivion. Also what about DLC will Any of those as be this added in this game?
There is one problem I actually have a PlayStation 4 not playstation 5. Plus will this game be available on PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox one and series. and what about Nintendo switch ever since Sora made it to smash this game should be on switch.
I just want to point out to anyone who missed it,    the guy at 5:47 does not just hop out of the car,   you can see what looks like Nu dark sides tendrils pulling him out.    This gives me hope that along with a more real world styling we may also get to see a darker version of the KH we know.    And before anyone makes any darkness jokes,   yes KH is sort of dark,   but we havent seen any normal people getting actually hurt by heartless since that random guy in kh1 turned into one in the middle of traverse town.
Mis mundos que quiero ver incluidos en Kingdom Hearts IV:  1: Endor (Star Wars VI: El Retorno del Jedi) 2: Toronto (Red) 3: Imperio de Kuzco (El Emperador y sus Locuras) 4: Springfield (Los Simpson: La Pelicula) 5: Radiador Springs (Cars) 6: Nueva York (Los Vengadores) 7: El Espacio (El Planeta del Tesoro) 8: Atlantis (Atlantis: El Imperio Perdido) 9: Antigua Inglaterra (Disney's Cuento de Navidad (A Christmas' Carol)) 10: Portorosso (Luca) 11: Tierra de los Muertos (Coco) 12: Danville (Phineas Y Ferb: A Través de la Segunda Dimensión) 13: Miauni (Star VS Las Fuerzas del Mal) 14: Free City (Sustituto para La Red) (Free Guy) 15: Kumandra (Raya y el Último Dragón)
I just figured it out... that place is the world for TWEWY she said is like a afterlife and isnt that game for them a afterlife
Oh wow I didn’t realise!! Whoops I can’t wait now!! 💕
6:09 Feels like "Rules of Nature" should have started playing around here :)
Should have made the trailers in English. Not that hard since all production is done at the same time.
Why Missing Link won't be playable even on console like ps4? Why??? Genshin Impact did!!!
Oh yeah KH IIIIIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSS BAAAAAAAAAAACKKKKKKKK
Can someone help me? At minute 4:16 / 4:17 the voice actor reminds me of a character, I know this voice and can’t remember which Character has this voice. Pls help it drives me crazy 😭
Give it to Square Enix and Nomura in making the most expensive jrpg franchise in existence. What other studio gets an almost full access to decades worth of IPs like (potentially) Star Wars and the entire Disney movie portfolio? I’m here dreaming of a Mary Poppins world one day!
6:25 alr who let sora watch TTGL?
Man, KH4 looks so real it's almost.. uncanny. I guess I'll wait and see how this goes but I sure did not expect that! Now I'm really looking forward to playing through KH1 again soon.
現世が舞台みたいですね‼️楽しみ いちお全シリーズほぼやってます☺️✨ スリープバイスリープは最後の敵がどうしても倒せん😂 そしてまだ３をクリアしてない😂アナ雪で止まってる❄️ また廃人にならなきゃ　緊急事態ならんかなぁー😂
Not gonna lie, I REALLY hope there’s at least one reference to what was revealed in the KHUX Finale in the Dark Road update/finale—there’s so much freaking potential, Nomura!!!!!!!
Who is voicing Sigurd!?!
HYYYYPE!!!! <3
My second time watching this video! Even after almost a week I’m still in awe by what has transpired!
It's a continue after Kingdom Hearts : Melody of Memory. Riku is reaching there so there should be 3 playable characters: Sora, Riku, and another one I forgot his name, looks like from another game. It's also signifying KH will start a new era : CROSSOVER WORLD like Tower of Saviours X Demon Slayer.
Sora finally do not need to borrow shoes from Mickey Mouse. HE IS AFFORDABLE TO BUY HIMSELF A NIKE SHOES!
AYOAYOAYOAYO
This is the ultimate surprise!  Sora!!!!!💜❤️👏🏾
4:43 Is that the back of an AT-ST Walker foot???
stop making phone games. stick to console/computer.
I don't know what to say but I hope the best for this series 🙏 😆😆
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY 😆😆🔥👑🥳🥳🥳
Yeah the visuals look amazing, but so did the ones in KH3 but it was boring imo (I can't describe why though). The focus was stunning visuals and retelling Disney stories instead of tight game mechanics like in KH2/DDS or unique content. Anyone else think the same or was KH3 your favourite in the series?
When in this year will kingdom hearts missing link come out?
Still wanna see "Once Upon A Time" version of "Captain Hook."
Star Wars - AT-ST’s foot on upper right 4:42
Graphics are amazing, but what happened to all the black flames when heartless materializes? It's all just threads and cotton.
the part of the florest is probably the naboo florest from phantom menance!
I was somewhat disappointed with the third episode so, here’s to hoping this one will pick things up!
Who was that guy that jumpscared Donald and Goofy?
Giga drill Breaker!!!!!
Square just dont make us wait for another 10 years for kh4 please thanks
Worlds I want to see: Princess Kilala Gargoyles the Animated Series Mighty Ducks The Animated Series The Avengers Star Wars Episode 4 "not 7" Characters I want to see: Mozenrath Mirage, Chaos, and Mechanicles from Aladdin the animated series. Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin fighting The Giant Chicken. Please I shortened the list.
Woot Hades confirmed to still be in the series. Which means so is Hercules.
I think Star Wars might be in Kingdom Hearts! The forest in the trailer looks like Endor, and you can see the back of the AT-ST's foor (or what looks to be)at 4:42!
Can't wait to buy this game after ten years🙂
And does the EX bar mean that drives are potentially returning but with an added twist
Hopefully Rikunis a playable character
Bro esos gráficos ya son de final fantasy , si el KH IV es asin , la verdad es que no lo compraria
I might cry. I might actually cry. Growing up with the KH games and now, at 21 years old they’ve made another. I cannot possibly wait.
I hope   dark road  finale  really  gives  us  xehanort   true  reasoning  for throwing  the  words  into  darkness , I'm not  buying  that  reasoning in kh3 , and missing  link  why could  they just make  it  a  console  game to  hold  us over  until kh4  releases. i  would have bought  it  or make it  free to play on both mobile  and  consoles
Watch this comment become history.
"If this isn't the ending you desired- if it brings you despair-  then leave this world for another your options are endless"  Translation: We get it. Not all of you liked KH3's ending. Get over it.
Least we don’t have to wait for another 13 years now. Maybe til 2023 or 2024. Hopefully mid 2023 I’m expecting.
I honestly think Missing Link is being done a major disservice being a mobile game. Lots of KH fans skipped Union X and Dark Road because of that, and with the fact that the graphics of the game actually look pretty solid, I honestly don't think most mobile devices will even be able to run it. I think the best course of action to even give it a chance at survival will be to put it on a console, like the Nintendo Switch.
WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is it Hades at the end ?
WOW
Looks like they came up with a catchier replacement for "Now In Development" lol
He knows giga drill breaker
Can some tell me who this narrator is
No more big shoes... 😩
strelitziaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  i screamed so loud during her reveal i'm so happy !!!!!  i hope this means she gets to fight alongside sora (maybe we could also get time to play as her?????!!) makes me wonder if "death death" in kh world just means having your soul/self/etc. shifted to another plane/universe which acts like an "afterworld" (in this case the modern world) or if what happened to strelitzia and sora is more akin to being isekai'd and them both being reincarnated in quadratum is a lucky coincidence
didn’t expected kh4
Even if all the world's I want too see don't make it in. I still am hyped to see what the game will be like. Can't afford any of the new consoles right now so that's a bummer. If I had to choose it would be Nintendo. Because PS5 is just too expensive for me to buy. That's why I enjoy let's plays from other people so I can at least enjoy the story. I know it spoils things for some people but there are those of us who just can't afford it right now. But I will still keep up with the series. Old fan staying true the best I can.
Name of the soundtrack it’s super awesome
Seriously tho these games are some major doo doo ass.
Would like to see Ozwald Rabbit too.
Best game since my childhood I played on PS2 KH games
Anyone notice the AT-ST foot from Star Wars @ 4:43 top right corner. Lol. Star Wars world confirmed???
does ANYONE know the ost for the dark road trailer? It sounds so familiar :(
People arguing about Sora’s “new look” are seriously forgetting that Sora has gone to various worlds and looked like:  - A Mermaid (Little Mermaid) - A Vampire (Nightmare before Christmas) - A Lion (Lion King) - A Pirate (Pirates of the Caribbean) - An Old Timey Cartoon (Timeless River) - A Toy (Toy Story) - A uh…video game character? (Tron) - A Monster (Monster’s Inc)  So, in all fairness, let’s just see where this goes. We saw Donald and Goofy being their regular selves. Who says this isn’t just a hyper-realistic world?
I think that was Hades at the end. Sora is in the Afterworld after all.
Both little kid me and adult me are SO excited right now! 😁
Both little kid me and adult me are SO excited right now. 😁
I can't stop watching this lol but the 2 hooded figures one is the master of masters but is the other one luxu why'd he come to quadratum
I wonder what the next trailer is going to be
Is that flame guy in the end of the trailer supposed to be Hades? I heard rumors it is him, but some tell me, is it him?
whos more excited for the new ultima weapon!!!! i know i am
This. Is. So. Beautiful. Wow… I was not expecting to see this. I literally grew up with this series ever since my dad randomly suggested this game for me at a store when I was only about 10 years old. I never imagined that it would not only take me on a tremendous nostalgia journey but become such a big memorable part of my upbringing. I am all for this. This blew me away. I never even knew Square Enix already had this in development. They are full of surprises and this just happens to be one of her best surprises I’ve ever come across.
UE5 will be on this game i really want this on xbox kingdom hearts 3 graphics were insane for a 2019 game
I hope Sora doesn't really end up looking like that eww
I wish this game could be like the 2nd one. That one was by far the best, best game play time, overall great game. I hope to see Kairi fighting & looking for Sora. We need to see more female representation man 😭👏🏻
Am I the only person that hears the beginning of somnus at 4:37?
I didn't expect to get these trailers so soon after the event, I'm glad they did it. ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN!!
MARLIN PIE & CEROBLAST are my sexy ass asian wives :P HAHAH I, HAVIER RAVEZ am the greatest guilty gear player of all time :P HAHAHA superman = WALKING SUN :P HAHAHA
Was that Hades in the end?
A main-numbered game directly following the last one, without any spinoffs in between?? Madness!!
Bro kingdom hearts is growing so much its amazing with final fantasy mix too
HYYYYPE! 😭
I'm So Happy 😁😁😭😭🥲🥲🙂😄😁 Sora Is Still Alive 🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️    May Your Heart🤎 be a Guided Key 🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️🗝️
Worlds/Characters I want to see: Kim Possible,Lilo and Stitch, Recess, American Dragon, and The Proud Family as part of one world/ The Disney Afternoon Avenue with Tailspin, DuckTales,Timone and Pumba, Darkwing Duck, Mighty Ducks The Animated Series, Gargoyles The Animated Series, Gummi Bears, Bonkers, Goof Troop and Chip n' Dale Rescue Rangers as part of one one world. A boss fight with Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin fighting The Giant Chicken. The Chaos God from Disney Adventures.  Mozenrath, Mirage, Chaos and Mechanicles from Aladdin the animated series.  The Phantom Blot as The Wizard Blot. Captain Hook from Once Upon A Time ABC channel series. The Incredibles The Avengers Star Wars Episode IV Malificent Up Cars  Wall-E Finding Nemo
I'm not hyped. Probably because of Disney's pro stance on grooming kids to have gender dysphoria.
Olympus returning and star wars aaand maybe something else dude lets gooooooooo
5:43 yooooo lightning McQueen in KH4?
So, in case anyone is foaming at the mouth in regards to what is in store for the series going forward, it appears that these past entries have story threads that set the stage for the Lost Master Arc: +X/Union Cross/Unchained/Back Cover +Dark Road +III +Missing-Link
I would wait 3 to 4 years to for kingdomheart 4 nex gen graphics upgrade this looks like spiderman graphics
I can’t believe Nomura chose to make kingdom hearts 4 first instead of Verum Rex! I’m so disappointed! Hopefully I’ll be alive to play Verum Rex 8 years from now!
KH4 IS GETTING STAR WARS FINALLY!!!! 4:42
Okay, was that Hades in the darkness with Donald and Goofy? Sure looked like it, but idk...
I was so scared this was going to be a "Do you not have phones?!" Type of announcement
Sora if he real
WHATS IN THE BOX!?
its hades at the end
when does kingdom hearts 4 come out?
Verum Rex when?
7:27 Is that.. who I think it is? Dr. Strange?

Kingdom Hearts 4 has unexpectedly been revealed. 5:06 Also, I’m still shocked at how adorable Strelitzia looks.🥰🤗
……. You didn’t even finish the last arc. Please let someone else write this story. Honestly square I’m sick of you ruining your own properties.
Happy 20th Anniversary Kingdom Hearts🏰👑❤
I don't want to wait more 5+ years to play this :(
"If there are other worlds out there, I wanna see em all"
So glad I grew up with this series and not Fortnite season 1
Nomura played mario odyssey got to new donk city and said hold my beer.
I hope they make the FF characters prominent again.
I love this game already but Sora's threads needs work I recommend giving him Noctis gear from final fantasy 13 versus and just add Sora's colors to it, he'll look great in it.
I love visiting Disney worlds!
This is the secret trailer for GTA VI
QUADRATUM?! This means yozora will be in this game? oh man, please make it happen!
No Goofy or Donald. What about king Mickey?!
I really hope utada does the song again for KH4. I would have it no other way. Also, I hope Sora is able to return to his friends. I don't want to play a new main characer :c
When are you going to release this on steam ;_;
20 years and Sora still can't go home lol
cringefest trash
Whats the ost for the first game?
SAYONARA sora s clown shoes youll be missed 2002-2022
Where is Sora?! Why is he looking so different?! Please change it back!!!!!!! 😱😱😱😱😱
⤴️ GET YOUR META ROYALTY 👑
The real story💯   https://youtu.be/1JF4mnTVG8Q
Definitely not done with Hercules I assume with blue fire/red fire at the end which presumably is likely to be Hades behind Donald and Goofy.
Can't wait for Kingdom Hearts 4, it's in the new world and Sora abilities are even cooler, the graphics, the motions are insane, looking forward to the storyline!!😍😍🔥🔥
I don't trust kh ,square enix and Disney anymore, kh3 was a rushed fail ,kh is getting split into to manny side mobile and platform games just to understand the story, square has an attics department (fake job ) witch is hiring woke ediots to censor everything that offends them, and Disney is grooming kids so yea not supporting this 2 companies anymore
I'm still in shock at how amazing that trailer was! Lore implications, visuals, gameplay and so much to speculate without giving to much away! Can't wait to see how KH4 comes out! And as a lore junkie I will definitely be testing out the mobile game and making time to watch Dark Roads finale!
This better not be a freaking *SOny GAYstation* exclusive. I better be able to see this on a Nintendo system as well *DAY 1 AT LAUNCH!!*
Can’t wait 😝
It is plausible Hades would know where Sora could be 🤔
The nostalgia of playing kingdom hearts 1 and 2 I loved it so much one of my favorite childhood games I'd spend endless amounts of time traveling to different worlds.... as a 27 year old man I kind of feel out of touch with my kid side as too me not playing kingdom hearts 3. After seeing this   MY CHILDHOOD FUN HAS CAMEBACK  FINISHING KH3 today
Hades at the End no doubt.
4:42 I’m sorry is that faqing AT-ST leg I see in the forest wait is that Endor
Am I only the one thinking KH4 to be multiplayer like monster hunter? 😂
AT-ST foot at 4:43?
Moment of silence for the ones who couldn’t witness this stay safe everyone
Me and kingdom hearts were both birthed in 2002. Me and Sora have literally grown up together. While I didn’t play the game till I was around 8, seeing this man grow up and get dripped out along side me has been a journey. Cant wait to finally play a more serious Kingdom Hearts! LETS GO BABYYY
I didn't expect to get these trailers so soon after the event, I'm glad they did it. ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN!!
Sora’s feet😭😭😭😭
“Your minds made up ?” Is such an iconic line in the series.
I'm so curious of what the new theme song for Kingdom Hearts 4 would be like. I am getting excited just thinking about it.
Hopefully they learned from 3
Yes, Kingdom Hearts 4! Let's go, I really love this franchise. Did not expect to see a small gameplay, it looks really amazing.
When you say, "I meant to do that," I totally believe you.
Kingdom Hearts 4 looks absolutely transcendental to the series. The gameplay transitioning from the cutscenes are so perfect. I think this is going to be the biggest leap the series has had since the original game back in 2002.   PS. @4:41 This is 100% a teaser showing Star Wars. This game is magically unbelievable.
I can already tell by how sora looks and the world he's in that this is gonna be a huge leap forward in what kingdom hearts can be and I can't wait to see it all unfold.
I've grown the past 20 years with the lessons and stories of the KH series held close in my heart and will now get to continue this journey of life getting to learn even more!
KH4 Looks sick! I'm glad Donald & Goofy are still around. 😭😭

Kingdom Hearts for PlayStation 2 will always be my favorite in the series
… release date 2032.
KH3 went to Epic to die. I imagine KH4 will do the same.
I was 8 years old when Kingdom Hearts 1 game out in 2001, now as a 28-year-old, still in love with this series and am looking forward to its future!
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE!!!!!!!!!!!!
“Your minds made up ?” Is such an iconic line in the series.
Travelling with hades in the afterlife to find sora. IM IN! just finished KH3 again last night. what a coincidence
I've grown the past 20 years with the lessons and stories of the KH series held close in my heart and will now get to continue this journey of life getting to learn even more!
Loved that I was completely surprised by this reveal. I thought this was just going to be an anniversary trailer with footage from the entire series. This was more than I could have ever asked for.
Maybe will now more details of kh4 in the recap video

Have y’all seen the KINGDOM HEARTS IV Reveal Trailer ► English Fandub?
KH4 Looks sick! I'm glad Donald & Goofy are still around. 😭😭
I can already tell by how sora looks and the world he's in that this is gonna be a huge leap forward in what kingdom hearts can be and I can't wait to see it all unfold.
the OST always go so hard when it's Kingdom Hearts like omg. Put this on Spotify fam.
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’ll never forget picking up the game in 2003 when I was just 10 years old. Putting that disc in my ps2 and playing this young spiky haired kid on an island with his 2 best friends will always be a memory of my childhood ♥️
BEST DAY EVER THIS ROCKS I LOVE KINGDOM HEARTS. DUDE the fact Sora is using his key blade like the lingering will did is giving me hella satisfaction
KH4 Looks sick! I'm glad Donald & Goofy are still around. 😭😭
I would love to see them turn Kingdom of hearts into an actual movie, this would be so awesome if they did it. I can't believe it's been 20 years that Kingdom of hearts been out and no one had ever tried to turn it into a movie yet.
I'm so curious of what the new theme song for Kingdom Hearts 4 would be like. I am getting excited just thinking about it.
SORA en el mundo real
KH4?! I was not expecting that at all when I woke up this morning! 😱
It’s really hard to believe that 20 years have passed since the first Kingdom Hearts masterpiece.  🔑 ❤️🙏🏻
omg  the music is iron man right?
You're a great listener.
SORA 4:50

I mean I'm super hyped for KH 4. However those graphic gave me mixed feelings.   Its still to early judge and alot of graphics arent done, but I really hope they gonna change Sora abit.
I cannot WAIIIIITTT!!!!!  I've got to get my pockets ready...
It’s really hard to believe that 20 years have passed since the first Kingdom Hearts masterpiece.  🔑 ❤️🙏🏻

Goty
OMG THANK YOU FOR THIS ❤
If 4:39 is a Star Wars level, I think seeing Darth Vader and Sephiroth face of would be one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen.
got dammit im going to have to actually play this one, it looks sick af
I can already tell by how sora looks and the world he's in that this is gonna be a huge leap forward in what kingdom hearts can be and I can't wait to see it all unfold.

You are glowing —and that's the least interesting thing about you, too.

looks bad imo
are we gonna have to wait another decade lol
KH4 Looks sick! I'm glad Donald & Goofy are still around. 😭😭
I can't wait !! 😍💙
KINGDOM HEARTS 4 BABY BRING IT ON!! Lol 💗
I can already tell by how sora looks and the world he's in that this is gonna be a huge leap forward in what kingdom hearts can be and I can't wait to see it all unfold.
It'd be so cool if the new game has worlds Disney bought. Marvel World, Muppets World, Star Wars World, and maybe dedicate the rest of the worlds to Pixar. There's already rumors that Star Wars is gonna show up what with the AT-ST foot in the forest.

Let the series die already. Nothing makes sense already

WE DID NOT HAVE TO WAIT 75 YEARS! YES!!!!
I really like Disney Kingdom Hearts 4. But, what date 📅 will release? August 2022.
Sora's feet are so small, it's distracting. Where are his clown-sized footwear?
this just make me wonder if this is going to be in development hell for 10 years
4:42 IS THAT A WALKER IS THIS FUCKING ENDOR
“WHY IS HE WEARING YEEZYS? WHAT IS HAPPENING.” — My Sister

thx u thx u  3 years since when but when this year becuase im buying if its as good as the trailer ill buy also which worlds we need to know
Thank you... BUT WHY DELAY DARK ROAD AGAIN! I'm losing my patience. Also, LAURIAM WE FOUND STRELITZIA!
Simply BEAUTIFUL! 😍😍😍
ost theme of kingdom hearts 4 part?
Supongo que KH4 será otra decepción
Damn this franchise i remembered kingdom hearts 1 such a nostalgic game. I'm 23 now. I remember playing this when i was around 6 years old wow
How is Marluxia's sister here!?
🐘 never forgot us did they. They remembered
Can't wait for buns' reaction to this
this dont look like kh anymore am a littel bit disappointed uff more like ff16 but thats not ff
Judging from what i know about the game (name of the protagonist, Disney involvement and enemies being called "heartless" which means Dead) i will assume that "someone' who Donald and Goofy were looking for is Hades: blue fire, stuck in fear when he is talking, when he rages fire becomes orange and he deals with dead ones... Without any spoilers can someone confirm my guess?
KH4 let's go!!!!! Sora looks awesome in that world. Been a fan since the first game.
PLEASE release the game either PHYSICAL OR DIGITAL and NOT CLOUD VERSION! In the nintendo switch!
¡POR FAVOR, saquen el juego ya sea FÍSICO O DIGITAL y NO EN VERSIÓN EN LA NUBE! En la nintendo switch
Brooooooo!!! This looks so amazing! I never would have imagined as a kid playing KH1 that the series would transcend in this way. I think it's a welcome change! Kingdom Hearts in real life! Ahhhh, I'm too excited. SO happy we didn't have to wait another decade to see the continuation of Sora's story this time!
I DONT HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 15 YEARS!?!?!??!!
Goofy: Cuz, can you bring Sora back from the dead?  Hades: Are you for real right now?
Was hyped for a Kingdom Hearts MMO, but iOS ruined my enthusiasm. Also, are all the attacks going to be based on those trophies? Basically just like X and Dark Road?
Ifrit
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Kingdom Hearts 4, the other two are meh but Kingdom Hearts 4 is definitely the best one.
kool. happy 20th
Meanwhile Sora's mother is still waiting for him to come home.......
Do not let Disney have their way and put controversial characters in this please.
WARP STRIKE!
❤️❤️❤️
Yeeeeeeessssssssssss
https://youtu.be/MmxQR1qr6r4
Oh. My. Garwsh. I’m so incredibly excited! This is absolutely incredible! Kingdom Hearts IV, Kingdom Hearts: Missing Link, and the ending of Kingdom Hearts: Dark Road?! I was not expecting so much to be announced at this event. Even though I’m not really into mobile games, I do make an exception for Kingdom Hearts (although I’ll probably mostly be in it for the story, like I was for Union x). But Kingdom Hearts IV is one that I absolutely love how it’s looking! I’m ready to wait another 6 to 47 years! (In all seriousness though, I hope it’s not as long of a wait as Kingdom Hearts III was. I love Kingdom Hearts III, but the wait between Dream Drop Distance and KH3 was kind of unbearable, lol). Either way, I’m super thankful for these announcements! Thank you Tetsuya Nomura and Square Enix!
Woow 😍❤️❤️❤️ Cool
Looks awful
They should've just announced it as Kingdom Hearts 4, would be more hype
Why was Donald scared in the end? Did he run out of zetaflares?
what platforms will kingdom hearts 4 be on?
Hopefully we don't have to wait another 5-6 years for kingdom hearts IV
So uuuh that an AT-ST foot cup in the top right corner at 4:41?
FAMILY GUY WORLD FOR KH4
Oh snap
Jesus loves you.🌷🌷🌷🌷
I CANT WAIT!!!!
looks so stupid!
WOW!
I’m so excited to be a part of the KH hype for KH 4! It looks so amazing and I can’t wait to play it, even if it takes a long time! I have watched this trailer so many times, I love it so much! Happy 20th Anniversary Kingdom Hearts! May your heart be your guiding key <3
Yawn Just woke up from a coma, been 10 years already? What? .....Bull s$&t.
am i the only one who wants the old font back?
The 10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners!  1. If everything is coming your way, then you're in the wrong lane. 2. Always go to other people's funerals, or they won't go to yours.  3.

Editorial: Maybe the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

Looks awful.
KH4 will probably release shortly before or shortly after The Elder Scrolls VI I'll guess.
Aki-dearest is probably losing her sh:$!
The only thing I will complain about is when the release date is or at least a release year
4:43 👀
I haven't seen Sora much, besides in the hauntingly deep and beautiful opening music [Sanctuary] by Hikaru Utada for Kingdom Hearts ll , where Kairi looks beautiful and is his girl I think! But the gameplay and graphics of this new game look Soo beyond me!! And Donald duck japanese baby voice at the end was Soo babyish and funny!! 😂  and exactly like his English throat nostril choking squeaky voice!! XD
ABC news Chicago means that they all boys dat look like gurls #Exposed
35# on trending? OMG!!!
Say it with me: LET 👏 It👏 COOK👏 Don't rush a thing. Don't release another trailer until it's almost time for launch. Don't make a bunch of bogus promises. Learn from the likes of cyberpunk. When it's ready, it's ready.
No steam release for the rest of the series yet? At least if it's perpetually on Epic Games Store say it explicitly instead of treating it like some weird state secret.
when does kingdom hearts missing link come out?
dreams and honour never forget
I don’t know how I fee about potentially waiting a decade+ for KH4….
So, am I the only one concerned about Aurora being around during Xehanort childhood, some 60 years prior BBS? Did the kids stumble upon the Book of Prophecy? Really curious about Dark Road finale...
Ending sosok misterius Goofy dan Donald ketemu Hades (Hercules). Api biru berubah menjadi api merah cuma Hades kemungkinan besar
The fact people are excited for KH4 after how shit KH3 was will never cease to amaze me.
This is amazing!! but pleaaaaase bring back FF characterssssss
4:38-4:45 sounds like Somnus! Nomura back at it again!
Wow , I HATE the realistic art style they tried here . Absolutely RUINED the game . Great job .
missing links trailer..... IS THE BOMB, ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS OF THE SERIES THIS FAR! HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE IT, IT SOUNDS BOTH EPIC, CATCHY, AND SOUNDS LIKE A CELEBRATION OF THE KINGDOM HEARTS SERIES PERIOD!
I never expected this... HOLY SHIT
Guessing what MOM meant at the end was that if Sora leaves this after world he will just straight up die and his heart will return to Kingdom hearts to be reborn. So Donald and Goofy will probably be finding a way to bring him back without killing him so they go to Hades.
That last trailer stands out the most, Darkside looks like he's more Final Fantasy than a KH enemy. Looks like KH4 will have T rating. Hopefully its available for Xbox One when it comes out.
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless them! Jesus died for our sins, rose again, and gives salvation to everyone who believes in him and follows his commandants!  Have a blessed day, everyone!! ❤
I never played Kingdom Hearts. Where should I start, and in what order?
Here's my analysis of 4's trailer.       MoM seems to be talking about how even though Sora saved all of his friends, if he's sad that he died he could try to return, but nothing would be the same.  We see lots of the Quadratum language. There was a 7 and 13, probably referencing, the lights and darknesses, so most of it is probably lore relevant. The full alphabet has not yet been translated sadly.  Darkside seems to be forming by using Darkness around him, maybe it's created by the negative emotions of the people.  The forest could be Endor, but nothing's really pointing to that besides it being a forest. Lots of people point out what could be an AT-ST foot, but it doesn't have the parts that stick out of one.  Sora's overall look should be the same, but he most likely only looks super realistic because of the World he's in. Almost every world gives Sora a new look, and while his overall proportions and hair are the same, his theme changes to fit the World. This world is practically identical to real life Shibuya, so he looks insanely realistic.  Strelitzia explains that this world is essentially like the afterlife, at least for her and Sora. That explains how she's here even though she died in Union X. Also, her hairclip has the roman numerals for 11 (iirc). I wouldn't be surprised if this was secretly important.  There are 2 building logos that are D-Eater and D-Dream, clearly referencing Dreams and Dream Eaters.   Darkside awakening takes place at least a little after Sora meets Strelitzia, since Sora now has his shoes on. Maybe they were going on a walk around the city. He seems unsure as to whether or not he can summon his Keyblade, so maybe Strelitzia cannot.  The "gameplay" seems mostly scripted. The UI has "Build", and Sora's grappling hook is coming from his Keyblade's keychain.  The MoM is with someone else, maybe it's Luxu.
Atlantis the lost empire and princess and the frog world will look nice for this game
Can't wait to talk about this to literally anyone I meet.
I don't like it. KH1 had the best space exploration building our Gummi ships I put hours into that and would not warp to worlds. I  miss the "grounded" combat of KH1, KH2 was pushing it a bit but now you might as well slap wings on my man Sora and call him Pit. Plus all the quicktime inputs now makes it feel like the fight is on rails but you don't even get that violent reward from something like god of war where after the guided experience you decapitate your enemy. "Face my Fears" was a step back and downplays Hikaru Utada actual musical talent for some....Skrillex? Ok. To top it all off to fully understand the story I need like 6 game systems and a light novel, or to spend hours on a wiki trying to figure out who is who in whos body and whos name is that backwards.  I'll play this game if its free.  No idea how KH3 outsold the others but we will see how this goes.
The announcement iz nice n all but I kinda need the game like thiz year
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
4:43 AT-ST foot! Star Wars f*cking confirmed!!!
There also looking for Sors again seriously every game they end up looking for him
But it’s literally the last abd the games were so good I think they should bring back the overdrive gauge and allow the form changes again like that they were better then the ones from most game
And I can also tell ya that that’s an at at or at st foot so who ever guess that is prob very coreect
I can tell you guys now that’s endor
Will Master Ava  get her Keyblade  wielders
Master Ava  and Sora  are  new World  and
finally lol!!🥳
The Lost Master Arc and Master Ava and Sora  mission  Will begin and P.S.  Ventus past  is  connected to past of Master of Master
Man, this is awesome. I still remember begging my parents daily to buy Kingdom Hearts 1 for me before Christmas in 2002. Can’t wait to be there on day 1 for this ❤️
I'm glad my grandkids will have something to look forward to.
Cant wait to play in 15 years!
If still no sephiroth, pass
I hate how small Sora’s shoes are…
Kh3 made me skeptical about everything. I want to be happy about this but I’m super nervous it’ll be just as bad as I thought 3 was.
To All Keyblade wielders  and  Keyboard  Master and yes Master Ava and Sora  have a new  Mission yes Master of Master  will Return
Boring video
Absolutely perfect
I'm looking forward to the new music that will be in the game especially new opening songs from Utada Hikaru! 😍
Tetsuya Nomura has not given up on creating Final Fantasy Versus XIII! So many parts of the KHIV trailer reminds me of the early Final Fantasy Versus XIII trailers.
This looks sick.
Só espero que tenha Português Brasileiro Please PT-BR
How did she alive
Nice finally in Star Wars worlds in kh4
KH4444444444444444444444
That forested area...  Strap in everyone, we're going to ride speeders through the forest of Endor as Ewok versions of our beloved trio!
The last thing I expected was a Giga Drill Break in this Kingdom Hearts trailer but here we are
⤴️Get your Meta iD now
This isn’t asuras wrath wtf is this
Dude, I am so ready for KH4. Though, I didn't realize how much Sora looks so much like Noctis.
1 word BEAUTIFUUUUUUUL! 😭
I thought it would take another twenty years before another Kingdom Hearts trailer
Me seeing the Title Card: "20th Anniversary?! OMFG!!! 😁😁😁🥰🥰🥰 Me watching the first six minutes: 😊😊☺☺🤗🤗 Me seeing the teaser for KH4: 😶😶😶...😲😲😲...🤩🤩🤩
I still can't get over seeing screen caps on Twitter and not putting it together this was part of the new game trailer. The graphics look pretty but it certainly feels like a different game to me at first glance. I really enjoyed the journey Kingdom Hearts took me on so I am down to play this whenever it comes it n-n;
Were people asking for this? It really looked like everyone was done with this series after how bad 3 was.
Took 10 plus years to make the trash that is KH3 and only 3 years for the 4th game?? Nahh I don’t trust like that
if u guys fuck this up im not buying 5
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
What a great surprise, kingdom hearts 4 looks beautiful, please release it soon.
Utada hikaru must be getting ready with another banger theme
🤯
Same fucking enemies. God they ruined this gorgeous series after the 2nd one
Yo it’s the kid from Smash Bros!?
KH + parkour, you better say sike rn!
Brooooo Sora's hair looks less spiky
…his shoes are too small.
Now let's hope we won't burn in nuclear fire before this releases
i came back here n watched this more than 30× times already
FINALLY
🥹
“Your minds made up ?” Is such an iconic line in the series.
See You In 2039 When Kingdom Hearts 4 Comes Out On The PS7!
Not even KH3 got me excited as KH4 trailer. I am impressed by all the changes. The game looks more serious & better graphics. This is a fresh entry that was needed. I hope they don’t keep dragging the same old stuff. I want new content, new characters, new story, not a summary or flash backs from previous games as they did in KH3. That game was just a filler. I like the route this is taking. I hope they focus in a brand new story (obviously I get that is going to be connected to the previous one) I also wish they don’t forget about Final Fantasy characters again.
This Darkside looks a bit different than I remember....
Can't wait to play this in 5 years
All I ask for is more Final Fantasy characters, and no more "disney attraction" summons.
How is this happening? Thank the powers that be!
Very hapy about KH4 I really am, but I don't know how I feel about more realistic looking Sora. I kinda got used to the old, a bit cartoonish style. Maybe that is just for a trailer though.
I am super happy for Dark Road. I am unsure about missing link. Action oriented phone games are NOT my forte. Might be the only KH game I don't beat.    KH4... it's brutally easy to tell that this game is still deep inside the development stages. 2025 release, but 2026 most likely. But I will be ready... even if I need a PS6.
Leta goooooooo baby!!
And once again. Can't play KH4. Don't have the money to buy the console 🥲
LET'S GO
Since Disney currently owns Fox (and Blue Sky), am I the only one who wants a *Robots* level in KH4?  “They want us to upgrade? Then, let’s upgrade!”
All these years gone by…can we please, PLEASE get Donald and Goody some new drip. Mickey gets a new look each game our boys deserve it
I’ve never heard Japanese Donald and Goofy VAs, and they sound almost like the English VA speaking Japanese. That’s pretty damn awesome.
Kinda realistic sora doesn't exist, it can't hurt you Kinda realistic sora: 5:12
Anyone know who called out to Donald and Goofy? I'm so curious.
I hope to God KH4 won't be more button mashing. KH3 was nothing but. Wait for the special abilities to flash up on screen and then use one after another. I miss the strategy and thought that went into the combat for original Kingdom Hearts game which made it more challenging.
Nomura has 0 respect for his fanbase. This looks horrible. Even Kh4 looks awful. Sora's design is awful. Sora is not from Tokyo. This is such a stupid way to move the story, and has NOTHING to do with Kingdom hearts.  RIP Kingdom Hearts. Nomura Killed it with the release of Kh3. Awful, unfinished, rushed game.
I called it months ago. A mobile game that no one will play, and another 5-10 years of waiting until any real KH mainline game comes out. Thank Square. This is why I didn't buy a PS3, or a PS4. And why I never will. I will pirate and play your games forever now, because you have 0 respect for your most devout fans.
I love how in the regular Kh universe it basically the original kh3 artstyle and then In quadratum it’s the ff15 one
Anyone else want to just talk about how small Sora's shoes are? Makes me want to quote the Simpson's.
Alguien me puede explicar que NARICES ES ESTOOOO!!!!!!! Buah como animen un juego así me muero. Ojalá salga pronto no en 10 años No se pero tengo la sensación de que no tardarán tanto como en el 3, del 2 al 3 no hubo ni trailers ni nada en tan poco tiempo
Very impressive graphics and lighting. This looks so good I thought maybe it is a CG pre render, then the gameplay part started!  We're finally seeing more examples of the current gen console power.
GRACIAS, DIOS!!! GRACIAS, GRACIAS, GRACIAS!!!! NO SE ME HABRÍA PODIDO IMAGINAR QUE PASARÍA ESTO AHORA 😭 CREÍ QUE MOSTRARÍAN ESA SUPUESTA SERIE EN DISNEY+ PERO ESTO???? ESTOOOOO!!!!???? CREO QUE NO PODRÉ DORMIR HOY POR TRATAR DE PROCESAR LO QUE ACABO DE VER ❤❤❤❤❤❤ GRACIAS, KINGDOM HEARTS🔥🔥🔥 FELICES 20 AÑOS Y QUE VENGAN MÁS!!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
THIS IS NOT A DRILL. WE HAVE CONFIRMATION ON A KH4! Seriously, this makes me so happy. This franchise and series of characters will always be close to heart.
While I'm glad in the sense that they are making KH4 now and not doing the stupid thing they did with KH3, after how bad KH3 was, I can't imagine actually playing KH4. They'd have to completely revamp their approach to storytelling AND gameplay.
Does someone get kind of Final Fantasy 13 Versus Vibes? Kind of?
just hope they put more color in the city. looks like concrete twon.  that jacket is kinda meh. Sora hair needs more gel. Hope that Firion and Lightning make into game since duodecim that pairing got me intrigued.  Noctis, ignis, promto and Gladio should make a cameo or be playable. since 3 lacked some FF blood when it released. other than that it looks sweet as f. too bad it gonna take 20 years to make😅😅😂
皆様お疲れ様ですこんばんはめちゃくちゃ最高ニャー😭チョーリアル感ニャー😭綺麗ニャー
After the awkward clusterf*ck that was KH3 I don't have high expectations for its sequel.  The graphics of the trailer are certainly a spectacle but Sora's new design is nearly unrecognizable, lacking any sort of silly adornments such as his comically large gloves and/or shoes.  I don't feel like waxing poetic about how the games prior were a cornerstone of my childhood but I will say that if this game doesn't turn out a lot better than KH3 I'll probably be done with the series as a whole.
MY DRILL IS THE DRILL THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS
Is kh good I mean can i buy the collection for kh and play the hole series  With 1.5 2.5 Or should i get the older version ?
I've come to kill Darkness.
WTF I THOUGH THEY SAID IT WAS FAKE?! ISNT IT??
My heart skipped so many beats when I first saw that IV
are donald and goofy looking for herc, hades or sora? I`m assuming they run into hades
I'm gonna pass out of mah god 😩
All those graphics, smaller shoes, an he still has flat hair.
https://youtube.com/shorts/UJeNr6WAxqs?feature=share
Can't wait to see Sora visiting the Lost Ark (Indiana Jones), Springfield (the Simpsons) and Tattooine (Star Wars). This is all thanks to disney!!! Thank you!!!
Hey did anyone notice that eraqus asked xehanort the same question that axel asked roxas when Roxas went to find sora and that xehanort said a similar response to what Axel asked roxas. Also the scene is similar to when axel asked roxas, "so, your minds made up?", To which Roxas replied, "why did the keyvlade choose me, I have to know.",  And in an angry way axel's response was, "You can't turn on the organization!". That reaction of axel is similar to when eraqus crossed blades with xehanort. And If I recall correctly axel eventually crossed blades with Roxas.
Haven't really enjoyed KH3 and this looks pretty much the same, guess i can still give it a shot but i have 0 expectations.
After what they did with KH3 I'm done with this series.
I love literally EVERYTHING about that KH4 trailer!!! SO EXCITED!!!!!
4:52 UNCANNY GRAPHICS! MY BRAIN!
It looks like Donald and goofy will encounter hades due to the fact that the only being that appeared in the kingdom hearts series that has blue fire for hair is hades. And hades blue fire like hair could be wiped out since It did get put out once before.
I hope they add the star wars world and the marvel world in kingdom hearts 4.
Too all the kingdom hearts fans who aren't able to be with us may there ❤️ hearts ♥️❤️💜♥️❤️♥️ be there guiding 🦮 keys 🗝️🔑🗝️🔑.
That forest shown is the Forest Moon of Endor
Mash Practice time😩
What game system will kingdom hearts 4 will on? I mean will kingdom hearts 4 come to playstation 4 and 5, Xbox one and series, and Nintendo switch may have problem compare to graphics issues Accept how it will unreal engine 5 work on Nintendo switch?And PC with everyone fan favorite more mods from the kingdom hearts community and also the super smash mod community will introduce Sora's new outfit from kingdom hearts 4.
The guy at the end is Hades. Blue flames when he comes, also red fire and he does have red fire from when he goes FEEL THE HEAT and it is the same voice actor. This is Unreal Engine 4 in the trailer. The game will have Unreal Engine 5.  Praise Donald and Goofy in Japanese
No. Fucking. Way.
So, Kukri is the bad guy, uh.
Sora for Smash!!!! Oh wait......... :(
They should try making the KH4 logo stand out more by making the V yellow do you agree?
Se viene Kh X y Missin Link que se espectacular. No puedo creerlo regresa tan pronto la cuarta parte espero que no me entre arena en los ojos ya suficiente con el final que me dejo la tercera parte :`v
4:42 Is that Aqua on the top right?
LETSSSS GOOO! KH4!
Why did they make Scalia as Caelum hit so hard!?
Oh my god!!!!!!! I can't wait to play kingdom hearts 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omfg!!!! Hell yes !!!
Looking forward for 2032
Missing Link looks like Pokemon Go. If this were a Pokemon game instead, I'd be convinced that's the final game. Dark Road is what I've been waiting for since Union Cross shutdown and KH4 made me squeal.
The Fourth Sequel of Kingdom Hearts 4 Will Be Coming Soon With New Adventures For Sora And His Friends May Your Heart Be Your Guiding Key ❤️💕💞🗝️🎊🎉🎈🎁💐
Kanye will probably release a new album before kingdom hearts 4
I was expecting the last trailer to be for Kingdom Hears 3.14159 or something but nearly choked when I saw the "IV"
*KH Dark Road Finale* Me: Oh cool. *KH Missing Link and KH4 Reveal trailer* Me: *SCREAMING INTENSIFIES*
Am I the only one who prefers they make a game for Switch ( like Chain of Memories for GBA, BBS for PSP or 358/2 Days for DS ) instead of insisting on focusing on mobile?
Let's goooooooooooooo!
That's the stuff.
OMF..G.THIS LOOKS AWSOME.
Cool now time to replay them
Can anyone that reads Japanese say what the command menu says???
Nomura just keeps pulling stuff out of his butt story-wise. I'm actually not excited for once.
Please. Enough with the cringey mobile game. Enough is enough, Square!
How tf are they coming out with 4 so soon? 3 practically just released (when you consider the gap between 2 and 3, in terms of real life years)
ok so, around 4:37 the music literally starts with the first 3 notes of Somnus, and the overall music for the khIV trailer sounded closer to versusXIII/ffXV than to KH, I don’t think that’s a coincidence. We already knew Quadratum was an Insomnia stand-in, but I really think Nomura’s building towards a full Versus XIII redo with Verum Rex, if not in this game, then a bit after, and this is just reestablishing its new universe. This is all too much 😭 WE WERE FED WELL TODAY BOYYZ.
Sora finally has normal-sized shoes 😨
Can't wait for kingdom hearts sigma beta alpha 3.9 and a half so I can understand less of the story unless someone says "light" and "darkness"
YESSSSSSSS
Kh4. Coming to you in 2032 on ps7.
Watch this game come out when the PS5 era ends 😂
🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻 sora!!!
Hell yeah! Can't wait to play KH 4 when it comes out in 10 years ^^ But seriously though, it looks amazing!
I can't wait to see Sora with a F*cking LIGHTSABER ON THE HIGH GROUND!!
When the trailer showed the city, I first thought I was watching the UE5 Matrix demo 😅.
If that's not Hades in these last few seconds, I'll eat my hat.
fei paw fei paw cha fei gay !  fei paw fei paw di lok soy !  IF ANYONE KNOWS THE NAME OF THIS CHINESE NURSERY RHYME PLEASE LET ME KNOW
Kingdom hearts is simply amazing
Here at 1,160,703 views.
please create a very good mobile game please 🥺🥺
Kingdom Hearts 4 release in 2048😂
Words can't describe how I'm excited I am for the next games in the Kingdom Hearts series and that 20 years later we're finally getting the 4th numbered KH title and Sora sporting his new look in the City of Quadratum.  Looking forward on what new Disney world's we might expect for KHIV and which one would return, but given that Hades' voice was heard at the end of the trailer confronting Donald and Goofy, no doubt that Hercules is going to return as a world, mostly the Underworld portion, considering that Disney world has appeared in almost *EVERY* KH game except _Dream Drop Distance_ and Nomura loves the character of Hades. Now beside Olympus returning here are my expectations on the Disney worlds we might expect to see in KH4 (subject to change):  1. _Frozen II_ (returning world) 2. _Toy Story_ (returning world) 3. _Aladdin_ (returning world; following the plot of the third film) 4. _Winnie the Pooh_ (returning world; optional) 5. _Zootopia_ 6. _The Incredibles_ or _Soul_ 7. _The Princess and the Frog_ 8. _Moana_ 9. _Raya and the Last Dragon_ 10. _Encanto_  11. _Coco_  12. _Lilo & Stitch_ (returning world but retelling the rest of the movie when Stitch arrives on Hawaii). 13. Star Wars (Did saw the foot of an AT-ST and what looks to be Endor)
I'm glad Donald & Goofy are still around
Man I hope it's on the ps4 kh4 so excited 😊
This looks like the FF15 Reveal trailer almost exactly down to the corridor in air and look how that turned out
as much as ill miss the more cartoony look this is freaking beautiful
Oh looks like we got a possible collab coming soon on wotv 🗿
I’m so EXCITED FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL GAME SERIES!!! KH has saved my life and I can’t wait to play with my daughter as she grows older too!!! I love how we can share the series and hype with others!!! ❤️ MAY OUR HEARTS BE OUR GUIDING KEY!!
This looks crazy good kh4
I’ll never forget picking up the game in 2003 when I was just 10 years old. Putting that disc in my ps2 and playing this young spiky haired kid on an island with his 2 best friends will always be a memory of my childhood ♥️
If that is who I think it is, why would Hades ever help them get Sora back?
It Hades
This looks great, but I wish disney wasn't acting sus lately
Il darkside demoniaco (heartless), perché è comparso di sua iniziativa (ma nei fictional world non c'è la luce e ne l'oscurità), la domanda com'è fatto comparire o evocarlo un heartless ossia darkside demoniaco, "lì in quel mondo non c'è luce e nemmeno l'oscurità", io credo che è stato il maestro dei maestri e l'altra figura incappucciata ha evocarlo il darkside demoniaco "forse all'interno nel maestro dei maestri risiede una delle tredici oscurità originali, ma tra le sette di quelle più forti (non sappiamo quanto siano potenti le sette oscurità originali tra le più forti, forse il loro potere è così tanto alto di aggirare le leggi dei fictional world "lì non si può usare il potere della luce e ne potere dell'oscurità naturalmente, l'unico modo
Not sure about the redesigns, but I'll have to see!
So, more changes to the Kingdom Key, like using it's chain as a grappling hook, and he seems to be able to harness the energy of the different keyblade's forms and  just release it,  like that drill form/Ragnarok combination he used.
"""""Gameplay""""" looks kinda bad tbh.
REAL LIFE SORA?! LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
6:57 We’re About To Arrive The New Age Of Kingdom Hearts! 🤩
I truly love what the team behind this has accomplished over the years. I have fond memories from the first game and every game in between. I guess I cannot sell my Nintendo switch now.
Disney in the background groping kids while you got Square doing the hard work
Let's go I am so excited for Kingdom hearts 4 😃😃😃
I can't get over soras design it's gonna take time getting used to it
0:16 what's this song called?
Yo its HAPPENING!!
Wait? Is this really happening? A KH4 in Unreal Engine 5? Really?!!!
Hell no I don’t like this!
Stop trying to make Versus XIII happen. It's over.
What the hell it’s just a retextured trailer of Final Fantasy Versus XIII from 2008 🤣
Ahhhhhhh SO EXCITING!!!!!!   OMG, So many new things, both new games look awesome! The new dearly beloved for ML sounds great! That High quality for KHIV ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I am still shocked that we are getting an announcement of KH4 this early wow what what timeline to live! Hope that Square Enix will make this a spectacular game and much more compelling story and hopefully they will add Marvel and Star Wars worlds (Light saber keyblade duels  Nuff said!) And hope that they will bring back Final Fantasy characters crossing my fingers even if they get characters such as Noctis from FFXV or Lightning from FFXiii I would still would be glad to have some sort of FF Characters to make an appearance
I've been a fan of Kingdom Hearts since the beginning and that's how me and my husband met! 🥰❤️ Our wedding was inspired by Kingdom Hearts, too! 💖💖 I couldn't be more excited!!!! 😍😍
Hades becomes a good guy?
Goofy's voice actor nailed it trying to imitate the tone and screams of the deceased Yū Shimaka
Kingdom Hearts for PlayStation 2 will always be my favorite in the series
4:42 top right- AT-ST foot
Out of nowhere a new numbered title? I thought it would take 10 years of spin off games to reach that point again. Surprised and hyped.
Wow 20 Years!! We really grew up with Kingdom Hearts and it just get's better!! LFGoG! Take My Money!
New kingdom hearts for Mobile yes yes yes yes
*WHERE DID THIS COME FROM!?*
If there's one thing Square Enix is good at, it's probably their surprise announcements.
Is this redemption or another let down?.. :/
Wow
Wat the hell is kingdom of hearts y'all talking bout dat computer game lollll
4:09 The lost master arc? does this mean sora is a keyblade master? (probably happened off screen or something) Or are they talking about someone else, and if so, who?
Hope this time will be more square-enix and less Disney..... Anyway I love kingdom hearts, every single game ....
I woke up this morning & thought I was still dreaming
Woohooo!!!!
Can't wait! 💙 Wondering if the soundtracks are still composed by Yoko Shimomura.
https://youtu.be/tnq3XiXEDM8
Who else he remembers that that red-headed lady was from the mobile game
i hope my grandsons will we able to play this game when it comes out
Well damn
Just please PLEASE Square don't f this up. 3 just didn't feel as good unlike kh2 final mix. The gameplay and story felt b tier at best. With exception to the 3 act. I'm still hopeful for this one, now that Square and Disney know people still like KH
wow please have the opening theme song be reversed and tell a story about about Sora and Yozora!!!!
Yeah, I'm done with Kingdom Hearts, time to close the book on that chapter of my life. One update for a mediocre phone game, another mediocre phone game, and a trailer that looks more like a tech demo than a KH game. This series has lost its identity.
Was not expecting this AT ALL. I just want them to take their time with this one...
never played a single game
KINGDOM HEARTS 4?!?!?!?!? OKAAAAY I WAS NOOOT EXPECTING THAT!!!! 😨
now to wait another 10 years for this game to come out LOL
Endor at 4:38. AT-ST foot
Wow.... 20 years. I still remember seeing the commercial for Kingdom Hearts on TV when I was 13, and my eyes growing wide.
Finally KH4, but Sora looks too real :(
Kingdom Hearts 4 looks so stunning ! The Game has to be running on Unreal Engine 5 ! I can't wait to grab the ultimate collector of it ! 💖💖💖💖
Yes.. is so obvious that Tetsuya Nomura is still pretty torn that he couldn't make and told the true original storyline of FFversusXIII game that was rebrand into the awful FF15 game. But now I think he's gonna tell this storyline through KH SAGA that's why YOZORA as the same style of NOCTIS and appears in the secret ending in KH3.
Yes!!!...now to wait until 2030 when it drops lol.
Everything about the Kingdom Hearts 4 trailer has Versus XIII written all over it and I love it. I've been looking forward to that specific vision of Nomura's since it was first announced when I was a kid. It feels like there's something Nomura needs to say and this might be his chance.
I'm absolutely sorry, but I can't watch the video until I play all of the Kingdom Hearts games on my Xbox to fully understand the story. Blind playthrough. No spoilers. ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS.
DONALD AND GOOFY HAVE FINALLY LEARNED TO SPEAK JAPANESE!!#🆗🆒🈂️🈁🈳🈶🈚🈸🈷️🈺🉑🈲🉐㊙️㊗️🈴🈵🈹🈲
Disney or square enix if you see this comment please put Oswald the lucky rabbit in kingdom hearts that all I ever wanted please
"KH-4FO' IS HUGE!!"
When will Dark Road is coming back
Take my money, please!
#TreasurePlanetForKH4OrBust
Considering that Square Enix has their own internal censorship team that reviews and can force changes to EVERY SINGLE SECOND of gameplay, it's a miracle Square Enix puts out new games.
❤️
The Lost Master Arc of Kingdom Hearts 4 yes Sora and Master Ava  mission will the beginning
Keyboard's
The guy that Donald and Goofy ran into could be Hades? The lord of underworld? That could make sense
Okay, this is gonna be cool.  Actually, no, I won’t even try to pretend to be casual; this is going to be INCREDIBLE!!
Let's announce non-cloud version for Switch! Oh wait....
I just want a classic Kingdom Hearts really, it seems too childish the recent ones.
Help from Hades i see ;)
im really crying.....
Can't fool me by calling Final Fantasy VS XIII Kingdom Hearts 4.
I somehow get the kingdom hearts 1 secret cutscene vibes from the trailer for KH4
I hope in like Kingdom Hearts 6 it can have a plot like Sora turning young again That way it can introduce us to Young Sora at least one last time
Wut??????
Im not crying you are😭😭😭
omg, Donald and Goofy ran into sans :0
instead of making mobile games, they should consider making a real multiplayer kingdom hearts spinoff for the fans... try something different, don't just try to rip fans off once again
Me at 5:42 *laughing* Chaos is exists. I knew it. I told you.
It's 10pm and I'm still coming back to this trailer still getting goosebumps  haven't been this hype since Arcane.
man 20 years............... was 20 20 years ago........................ i'm old & still love the series
Still no Final Fantasy characters!? Not too excited about this quite yet.
Is it just me or is there something off about this new Final Fantasy game?
Donald and Goofy are searching for vanitas
KH4
Kingdom heart   new Keyblade wielders and Old friends  Return yes Sora  and Master Ava  and Ventus past
Kingdom 4 Sora meet Master Ava  and New Missing   and  Master of Master
7:02 why do I get the feeling it’s not hades🤔🤔🤔
COVID 19 VACCINE IS NOT A VACCINE. IT IS POISON, AND A COMPOUND MIRCROSCOPE CAN PROVE THIS.  HEALING IN JESUS CHRIST CAN HEAL YOU. IF YOU SEEK HIM WITH ALL YOUR HEART..
OMG YES
It is curious that the name "lost master arc" should not be talking about sora, since he never became a keyblade master
Realmente la confirmación de KH4 me dejó impactado pensé que no iba a ser tan pronto.
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
I'm in tears. I.... This is so much more then I except to get. And that new dearly beloved in Missing Link. I'm in love with it!
There's going to be a Kingdom Hearts 4? Awesome!
THAT IS AMAZING
Looks like a Multiplayer mobile game. that has pc crossplay.
4:41 is that an AT-ST foot in the top right?
*sees the one guy taking a video of the Darkside with his phone*  YES!🤣
no release date on kh4, which means at the earliest fall 2023, and most likely fall 2024
can't wait to play kingdom hearts 4 in 2028
Well someone is a fan of Gurren Laggan with those keyblade drill attacks.
2:46 - 3:02 THE MUSIC😭♥️
Copy paste of my thoughts on another video about KH4:  5:53 Of course there had to be someone taking a photo in front of a god damn heartless monster. Also is that like a monster form darkside? Kind of shares similar characteristics.   Also 4:41 Ik some people are saying Star wars with that hoof thing but idk if it fits into kh4. Like even though it's more realistic, I don't feel Kh4 gives off the vibe of having disney worlds in it. Like will we be getting only Endor for Star wars? Just feels strange.  Some things I am wondering and stuff: She said afterworld so it's pretty mysterious. Also no shadows on the ground atm so it's still early it seems. And 2 hooded figures huh (edit: I forgot Luxu/Xigbar. So him and MoM)? Idk who the other is. And Donald and Goofy? Where are they and why do we have them appearing? Also what about the others like Roxas, Aqua, etc. do they not care or can't go there?  Depending on what platform it will be on like if it's on Steam, I will get it. Otherwise I probably won't. As for criticisms/problems I have with this trailer, here are some of them:  Sora has dipped a bit too far into Final Fantasy design. His goofy shoes are gone, his look being more like Yozora (like a blend of Sora and Yozora so maybe they combined into one? Idk.), his hair is less spiky overall, and his outfit being too realistic instead of having a Disney flair to it. I didn't come for Disney stuff, but it gave Sora a unique identity, being in the middle of FF and Disney design-wise.  This has mostly cutscene transitions rather than full on combat. Would have liked to have seen the combat in action.   If they are going to put a lot of effort into designing Quadratum's world, then the story might only be here? No disney or other worlds perhaps?
I am 37 years old now, and this series has been such a huge part of my life. I cannot wait for these games omg.
Thank you for this i have loved this game series for 20 years  . I have grown with the series along with the many lessons  . I remember when i had seen the official announcement for the game on tv when i was little . I received the game for my 7th birthday which was rocket power themed and i cried that day i got the game. Today felt like a very early 26th birthday gift and my birthday is not until may 17th and i would not have found people who love the game series as much as I do  . I also would not have my boyfriend who loves me and my love for this game series. One lesson i know that has stayed true is may my heart be my guiding key as well as my friends are my keys and i just wanted to say a big thank you to Disney as well as the creator of the series Tetsuya Nomura and square enix for creating my favorite video game series and cheers to many more years of this fantastic series. I'm currently 25 and i have loved this series for 20 years
So we have a prequel to KH before the keyblade wars I'm guessing, and Quadratum with a more Final Fantasy looking Sora (not that big of a fan of his design). Will be interesting to see more shown.
This feels so surreal....I love it though ❤💯💫
STAR WARS 100% CONFIRMEND FOR KINGDOM HEARTS 4
MY BOY IS ALL GROWN UP! 😭 He Looks so good!! ❤️❤️❤️
I'm- this- I'm so happy in a way idt anyone would understand
Was anyone else ready for Somnus at 4:38?
I hope this is available in ps4
4:41 top right corner. That's an AT-AT foot. This has to be Endor
I played kingdom hearts since first game came out it amazing to see how kingdom hearts 1 became something like this
大半の人がもういいよって思ってそう。  どうせ出るの5年後か10年後でしょ？
YouTube's most disturbing artist: https://youtu.be/nfUyZQf-Jdw
Thanks Square i will have play this game
Bro it’s the guy from smash brothers
This is a rant for the people who are less happy or generally anxious over all this potential "change" being thrown around right now.   I don't entirely get how anyone could take this as negatively as some seemingly are. Some worry I completely understand but good lord It's a single trailer and we don't even know the gameplay like--   And do people forget KH is born from taking massive risk? The original concept was FF + Disney and everyone thought that was insane then... Would SW really be THAT big of a stretch with how far we've come? And as Nomura made more games the FF character tie ins slowly faded out more and got almost entirely replaced by Nomura's characters which is... Fine even if it hurts me still because I felt like the FF characters had character development/importance with Sora and I don't understand how we didn't go to Radiant Garden in KH3 but I'm gonna go off rails so far if I don't stop there.  I can't predict what's going on behind the scenes or how much Disney properties and adventure to other worlds will be involved here because It's one freakin trailer and I'm not a wizard, But I can at least TRY off of my thoughts and feelings alone.     Compare Yozora to Sora in terms of what where and how they fight. It's quite literally like night and day and I think that's important to look at because Yozora is being represented as Sora's "other" like many characters have before except THIS time it's like a mirror of someone who is a true protagonist of their world like Sora that, in essence, Is a Final Fantasy character. And It's not like Sora isn't and hasn't been serious before... But, and this is just a hunch, I believe that Yozora has dealt with much more evil and serious problems over the course of his life.  I believe that this mysterious world Sora is in represents the SQUARE ENIX side of things being more involved this time and Nomura's strengths will shine brighter as a result, As the world may be used to put things into more of a balance like Radiant Garden once did and will help reflect how Sora has grown up further as a bonus. This doesn't have to mean Sora/Riku always have to be in the serious world and I don't think we should panic over the mere IDEA of Star Wars being in the game without even having an inkling of what's going on from one trailer (Though I'd be lying if I said that mere idea wasn't thought over in my head logistically and didn't quite make sense [Equips megaphone] *WHEN APPLYING IT TO THE USUAL FORMULA* )   No matter what it's gonna be a chaotic mess because that's how Nomura rolls in almost every thing he's written and helped write. At worst the characters development won't make sense/will contradict itself (Riku) while he simultaneously throws insane vague and or confusing plot devices (Lest we forget we long since passed the time travel line) and Nomura will add things to the plot that feel like they show up out of nowhere for the sake of sparking fresh and new feeling conflict (Insert RPG enemy group here).   Ever since Yozora started presenting himself like the original Noctis did in the old version of FF15 (Like in the car) I took it as a signal that Nomura was about to go wild. And since as people we have very different ideas you probably won't reach anywhere near having the same conclusions as me to feel more at ease and we BOTH know after coming this far there's no truly stopping even if you try to tell yourself there is (358/2 remakes and games across every console imaginable) I can at the very least tell you to just...   Buckle up.
I may be literally the only person on earth who is: But I'm excited for Missing-Link.  I came to Union Cross ridiculously late (after trying Chi or something YEARS ago on PC one afternoon - I remember playing something cartoony where I got a bracelet to gather Lux and literally nothing else except some Dwarves, I think...), and I started UC the last month the servers were open AND completed the game up to current before the final patch so I got to do it live (also maxing out the initial Keyblade to level 60 and posting a guide on Reddit for anyone else to follow - because some of that stuff was confusing; it's honestly one of the crazier things I've ever done in gaming, figuring out YEARS of gaming systems, Novas and ReNovas and so on, and making it all work with my rather limited crystal budget since the store no longer existed TO buy them with real world money to speed the process and I was on a time crunch...though I got all the way to the end mission ready for final patch in...two and a half days), and I actually thought it was a neat system when the "gotcha" stuff was put on hold (yes, I know it's "gatcha", but it's more like "gotcha to spend tons of money!")  ...and I've been thinking ever since it came down how it kind of sucks that there's not an online service KH game (even if I hope this is for PC because I hate trying to play an action-y game on a mobile phone).  I also love multiplayer, and I want to know what's going on in that gap of history we still don't fully understand.  Oh, and I LOVE the rendition of Dearly Beloved there, it rocks!  I want to pour over this section and tease out its secrets.  I know I'll never get lucky enough to be part of the Beta, but I want to play this so bad when it comes out...and I definitely wouldn't turn down a Beta invite if I got one.  So far, all I can tell is it looks to be multiplayer in at least some sense, uses little statue/amiibo things for attacks, and...maybe it's just part of the character customization, but there seems to be a Wisdom/Caster form ("classes"?) that floats and casts magic and a Valor/Physical/Melee form.  Looking at either side of 3:25, the red suited character before then is clearly a ground/melee fighter, but the one with the green hat and blond hair is floating/flying and seems to just be casting ranged attacks.  This could just be the metals they're using (let's be honest - we're all going to call them "metals"), but could also indicate that the game might have classes in some respect.  Not sure what the white robed character's focus is...  Granted, I could just be seeing things, but one character seems very floaty and mobile, and another clearly walking on the ground, and it makes me think of Valor or Master (ground, fast run speed) vs Final form in KH2.  EDIT: Note green hat's NORMAL ATTACKS seem to be ranged magic shots, vs the one in red whose normal attacks seem to be melee.  Note by "normal" here I mean "aren't using medals".
If SE has taught us anything these will NOT be anywhere close the the final visuals of KH4 it will change drastically. This is filler, don't believe their lies.
So anybody got predictions or hopes for Worlds? Mine is Lilo & Stitch lol
Kingdom hearts has been something that holds my family together for a long time and I've grown up with it. And am happy we are still doing so today!
wrong design for this kind of game, it's supposed to look cartooney, at this point idc anymore all the games I love were ruined so whatever
4:10 The Lost Master, ARC
GAWDDDD THANK YOU SO MUCH SQUARE 😭😭😭
Wait is it coming out this year
I love the KH franchise and am so happy for 4.
Did you guys see the AT-ST foot??? Star Wars in KH4??
Kh4 the meet it oh my new ps4 ps5 my two game disney action kh4 in are what tv 🎮
Я думал Square enix хотят ремейк аватарии сделать, но оказалось не так
Loved that I was completely surprised by this reveal. I thought this was just going to be an anniversary trailer with footage from the entire series. This was more than I could have ever asked for.
He’s a grown young man he isn’t a boy anymore
You can tell this game gonna be built different cuz no one is falling backwards in the trailer…
I have been crying since January 2019, this is a go people, THIS IS A GO!!!!
Let's hope for a Homer Simpson Summon that strangles an Enemy. Oh and Peter Griffin of cause.
STEAM?
SORA HAS NORMAL SIZE FEET!!!!
I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, rejection, or pains of loneliness and self-doubt. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of the pains of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9
Another reason to live
the gameplay of KH4 feels like they only spent a month preparing everything for this trailer and they will have to spend AT LEAST 5 years to come close to finishing it.
KH4? Why not keep the chain going and make KH3.8 or 3.5 or some other random decimal?! 🤣
Omg, I started crying when Sora was running in to fight the heartless! My litte Sora has come so far! :"( <3 <3 <3
❤😍
lol they gave him Noctis's hair style
OMGMMFFMNF KICKING AND SCREAMING RIGHT NOW  THIS IS NOT A DRILL AHAAAGSGSHSHS😟😟😟😟😟😟
I feel like the KH4 trailer was a jumbled mess of a bunch of previous anime/video games.  Sora going after the heartless looked like Deku doing his first smash, the atmosphere is very The World Ends With You like, and I got serious Gurren Lagaan vibes from the Keyblade drill piercing the heavens.
Love the beginning song makes me hype and gives me goose bumps
And so the Kingdom Hearts IV hype train begins...
つまり、俺たち、ソラと同じ空が見える、ってｺﾄ?!
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤
I hope that there's more Final Fantasy emphasis in this title. It's been 20 years that Disney's characters overcomes FF's
this looks unecesary
"Magic in the Making." Is that the gonna be the new "Now in Development" meme?            But no, seriously: *OMDFG KHIV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
Shrelitzia HAS return!!!!
I never realized how close the Japanese voices for Donald and goofy were to the American version lol they sound just alike
Love these vids
4:42 Is that what I think it is in the top-right corner?       STAR WARS CONFIRMED FOR KINGDOM HEARTS!
Damn! Sora looks like Yozora. Now I understand to Rex xD.
Bro this shit got me at the edge of my fucking seat 🔥🔥🔥 KH4 looks amazing. I'm really looking forward with the direction the series is going. Nomura you fucking madman!!!
KH4 looks so… beautiful.
I love how the whole KH community is calling KHIII 2 KH4 is not KH4 because it clearly says KHIII
Lets go boys KH4 is finally confirmed
R.I.P Sora’s OG shoes.
Huh so Donald and goofy are looking looking for sora in a dark area, suddenly there's a blue flame that turns red as the voice gets upset... hades?
Please Disney, let Oswald be in the series this time. Allow Nomura to use the lucky rabbit.
Whondering what Hades will do in this chapter ... any guess?!
Sad to say, but absolutely not hyped...  Again a bunch of meaningless spin-offs ahead before the 4 to make the story even more confused and to go through again and again the same worlds and pattern ...  And for kh4, so we're  starting a new scenaristic arc right.. means few answers and more questions. And  coming from Square Enix , I wouldn't  trust anything I see from their footage... Wait and see
OH MY GOD!!!!!😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩
WHEN HE SUMMONS THE KINGDOM KEY... 6:00
can anyone tell who the voice is that attacked Donald and Goofy?
Wasn't expecting to see KH4 but I'm happy that it finally exists! I can't wait to see more
Ay Yo? Kingdom Hearts 4?! Releasing In 2032?! Well If Kingdom Hearts 3 Took Long Then This One Is Gonna Be Even Longer
The animation is A1
Anybody else unsure about the artstyle?
KH4 Let’s get it. What be cool too is if Square Enix made another Deus Ex game
YES YES YES YESSSSSSSSS ITS HERE KH4 IS HERE
I'm a bit stunned. I was not at all expecting to see anything like a KH announcement for two new games today - in particular, KH4 (!!!). It looks incredible!!!   Also, I love the idea of bringing KH elements into a more "modern" setting. There have been worlds that were cities, but nothing like what is shown in this trailer.
WHAT NO FREAKIN WAY 🤯
I personally want Kingdom Hearts 4 to include worlds based on Zootopia, Moana, Coco, Raya and the Last Dragon, Luca, Encanto, Turning Red, Gravity Falls and a mini-game world based on Phineas and Ferb or Vampirina. I also want to see a really funny scene where Sisu (from Raya and the Last Dragon) accidentally swallows Sora whole and vomits him out. Lastly, I want to see a scene where Sora and Raya do an epic handshake similar to the “epic handshake” from Predator, and I want Sora to be a Bobcat or Lynx in the Zootopia based world. I can't wait to see what Kingdom Hearts 4 will have. People need to spread the word about this!
Me and kingdom hearts were both birthed in 2002. Me and Sora have literally grown up together. While I didn’t play the game till I was around 8, seeing this man grow up and get dripped out along side me has been a journey. Cant wait to finally play a more serious Kingdom Hearts! LETS GO BABYYY
I can’t believe where getting a Star Wars world in Kingdom Hearts. Hopefully we’ll get a Muppet world.
WHAT IS THE BLUE FLAME THO
KH4 YES YES!!
She says Quadratum, isn't that a world inside the Verum Rex game from the toy story world? Are we gonna have to team up with Yozora to figure all of this out, oooohhh I am excited
RIP CLOWN SHOES YOU SHALL BE MISSED 😭
Look way better than kh3 did
At the end of the video we saw Donald and Goofy looking for Sora and than Hades showed up right behind them.
20 years since the first game, and we are seeing Sora in our human world. My excitement for KH4 is out of this world, pun intended
great...Square Enix teasing KH4 SOOO fucken early...see you all in 5 years on the 25th anniversary.
Are Donald and Goofy in the Underworld? This would make sense since Sora might have died and his soul is now with all fellow fallen Keyblade warriors. And he might be resurrected? Dude, so many questions!
That's dead-to-rights Hades at the end holy frick
They're never getting rid of Darkside are they?
"Say fellas, did somebody mention the door to darkness?" ~ I liked how they showed Sora's feet to emphasize the more realistic proportions in the new world lol. Interestingly, this new world seems to takes into consideration actual irl cultural customs (Japanese/Asian) like taking off your shoes indoors, KH4 is really blurring the lines of reality! Also, Star Wars world confirmed !?!?!
New Facts about KH4: Sora is Now 17 Year old!!!Officially True! 2-Sora is Wearing a New Red and Black  Jacket! 3-The is Quadratum is actually,Shibuya,Tokyo,Japan!!
Sora has normal shoes. WHAT?!
4:42 stat wars??? At-st?????
They kinda blew it. If the third one was even kinda decent everyone and their grandma would have played it
😭
👎
I'll come back to this comment the day Kingdom Hearts IV releases!
Please, don't be like KH3 <3
I am literally crying I am so happy
6:44: Great, now there’s 2 of them.
I really wanted a Disney plus series but this is really cool!
Give sora his big shoes and more spikey hair back
Beautiful
I knew it!  The graphics are good but it doesn't look like Kingdom Hearts at all... this is the Versus XIII wannabe that Nomura wanted but couldn't have because their bosses tried to have their own GTAV (that ended in failure) and used Kingdom Hearts to turning it into something else. The same situtation happened with Metal Gear Solid V and Final Fantasy XIII, everyone blinded by the quality of the graphics but not understanding what is happening in front of them. Yeah, I'm going to drop Kingdom Hearts, too bad because I really used to love this saga, man, I'm even a Chain of Memories and Coded defender and imported both Final Mix and Re:Coded (in full japanese the last one) for PS2 years ago when Square-Enix didn't give us the final editions of their games. I'm starting to realize that it wasn't that bad that they saw us as 2nd class customers.  First the censorship (that stupid "Ethics" Department) and the ugly western-look like character design crap that ruined the Final Fantasy saga and now is time to say goodbye to Kingdom Hearts because Nomura can't deal with his Versus XIII trauma and is obsessed with Sasuke, Gackt and boybands. And I'm not forgetting the boring emo drama that ruined Parasite Eve with The 3rd Birthday. If they change Dragon Quest too I'm done with Square-Enix, they're a shadow of what they used to be.
WTF YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I'm most hyped for more Strelitzia!! Glad to see best girl (from KHUX) get more attention.
This time as a person who enjoyed playing KH games in the past, I don't want to raise any expectations about this one as I wasn't even expecting a release of a new KH game!  It's probably better not to lol.
Sora finally grew into his shoes 😳
But is no one excited for missing link it looks fabulous for a mobile game and is what we need for a sequel to union x so excited to have a cac in these graphics can't wait to play all of them
Is that supposed to be Sora? Not sure if I'm a fan of how he looks in this game got a more final fantasy type look
4:42 if you zoom in at the top right it looks exactly like an AT ST foot
Jesus christ just give up already this looks horrible. How are people expecting this to not turn out bad? Why do people keep falling for this hype crap.
Strelitzia is so adorable.
Well this is going to be interesting for sure the first trailer was amazing but i really wonder if the entire game does play in Quadratum if thats the case it's a big gamble the iconic disney worlds are a very Important part of the series it's hatd to think of a mainline KH without any disney worlds 🤔 well this is the first trailer we all know how long it took them to release KH3 after the first trailer... at best i say it will take 5 years before the release probably even longer i hope we get more than mobile sidegames to hold us over
why boss no make animal crossing villager sounds?
4:42 AT-ST babay !
I can't believe how much I reacted to Sora wearing no shoes. At least we know he had normal sized feet. And now normal sized shoes? He looks good! Wonder who that was at the end with Donald and Goofy. I thought Hades at first, but I dunno.   Maybe because of the flames it might be Genesis? lol. That'd actually be pretty cool, ngl. But I know its not him.
I was not ready for this I already teared up when I saw sora on the sofa THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS CREATING SUCH BEAUTIFUL STORIES I CAN'T WAIT!!
Please let that be Endor so our memes of Star Wars in KH be real
How are they going to crap on the franchise this time?
KH4 = FF VERSUS.  YOZORA = real noctis versus 13 vision.
I LITERALLY SCREAMED MY HEART OUT WHEN I SAW SORA LYING ON THE COUCH I WASNT EXPECTING THAT OMGGGGGGG I need someone to pinch me
Is this gonna be for Disneystation +?
I squealed so loud when I saw Sora, nearly made my dad crash the car from the scare. 😂
My boy Sora’s all grown up now
Please, for the love of god, take KH away from Nomura. I can't stand these terrible convoluted stories anymore.
No exclusives please Square and bring back FF characters.
They made him a real boi!
Just, from the bottom of my heart - Thank you <3
Guessing Goofy and Donald ran into Hades while trying to find Sora in the underworld.
They gave Sora a Final Fantasy facelift.
Another Kingdom Sharts game 🤮
Sora but in real life new york city
The only reason I bought a PS4, 8 years ago is the KH3 possibility. If this is a PS5 exclusive, no matter how much I hate the Ps5 looks, I may actually be considering to buy it.
Just turn 40 now,and I'm still fan on Kingdom Hearts this very day!🤣
The time has come again for the wait for Kingdom Hearts.
OMG I'm so excited for Kingdom Hearts IV when is it releasing?
I've learned that it's always the title that has the IV in it that is usually the best. Time will tell.
Subscribe to Tonbak Tutorial Enjoy https://youtube.com/channel/UCp1vj4sT1561sYBBZzca2nA
I'm still dreaming right?
Looks like Sora, has become a Real life Human Character Protagonist,in his own Final Fantasy World!!!
4:08
This game better have the star wars world and marvel world too as well.
PLEASE tell me that Donald and Goofy aren't so desperate to see Sora again that they would make a deal with Hades!!!
I'm so curious of what the new theme song for Kingdom Hearts 4 would be like. I am getting excited just thinking about it.
I love kingdom hearts, but please make it good this time
I wonder how many people click away because the first half is Union X, before revealing actual new console gameplay
Finally getting a decent looking kingdom hearts game for smartphone🥳🥳🥳 hell yeah!
This looks like trash
7:01 I like how Donald is using his staff as a light source it looks cool
_Oh my gosh, I just realized Donald and Goofy are looking for Sir Auron._
It didn't take them 14 years this time either.
Who else loves basketball and this dope game
emotional damage
3:09-3:19 ... soo, outside of scala ad caelum, we get what appears to be kingdom of corona and maybe the keyblade graveyard in Missing Link?   (What other worlds and heartless can we expect to see in that game?)
shout out to that red chevy cobalt
kh4 a few years ago it's just a meme but... please tell me it's just a meme
A moment of silence for sora’s clown shoes
I'm guessing one of the upperclassmen is going to be named Verdandi, following Skuld and Urd's names.
It's gonna be _so trippy_ going from hyper realism to KH-cartoon verse.
SAW STRELITZIA AND SCREAMED!! SO EXCITED!! ❤️❤️❤️
why can they NEVER do the announcement videos with the good voice cast?
Strelitzia! 😍
Finally some news! SO EXCITED. Realistic Sora omg 🤩 So it’s him like in Pirates of the Caribbean but in modern clothes now! But his hair looks different? It’s only been 7 days in that world so I don’t think it could have changed so much in that time. Anyway, I’m glad we have our powers still. Sora finally doesn’t have to start all over lol. Sliding through the building was amazing!  And logo font change? I wonder why?
See you in 84 years when KH4 is released. 🤣
Calling it: I don't think that was Hades at the end of the Kingdom Hearts 4 trailer: I think it was Yozora, there to "save" Donald and Goofy, effectively bringing them to Quadratum with the new artstyle
NOOO I REALLY THOUGHT KH4 WAS GONNA LEAVE OUT DISNEY AND RIKU AND JUST FOCUS ON SORA
Omg, I just watched it going into my birthday! The announcement for KH4 is a perfect present!! :D I was literally crying out of joy!! I cannot wait
This is gonna be good! Let the Lost Master Arc begin!!
Its incredible to just read these comments and see so many hearts kingdom hearts has touched, this franchise is everything to me man 😭
ok its a shit game kh4 is shit  i love 1-3
🔥 🔥 🔥
Just so everybody is on the same page… that was Hades (Lord of the Dead) at the end, right? Weird they feel the need to put Olympus in this game… Coliseum back finally?
Welp time to wait 9 years for this one
KINGDOM HEARTS IV IS IN THE HOUSE, BABAYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!! WOOOOO!!!!!!!
7:17 Sans confirmed
We can all agree that they never disappoint us with their content 💛💛💛
Awesome Kingdom Hearts 20th Anniversary Announcement Trailer.
Cant wait for this game to come out in 2032 lmaoooo
Can't wait to not give you any more money an pirate it. Since KH3 was BULLSHIT
What crap is this. Genshin impact has put you to shame 🤣
My guy Sora be looking a lot like Sion from The Bouncer now
Nomura, why did you give Sora Noctis' hair?
I've grown the past 20 years with the lessons and stories of the KH series held close in my heart and will now get to continue this journey of life getting to learn even more!
Y'know this Master of Master is giving off Tobi vibes....HMMMMMMMM.
En francais svp
Aw yeah! LET'S GO!!!!
I thought this was fake when i saw it in my recommendations.. wtf yall.. HOLY SMOKES!
東京が舞台ですね再開発前の渋谷とか新宿とか映っているソラが続投といいおしらせでしたアプリは2個いらないから早めに４お願いします
How long as it been since 3, and 4 *already* looks *this* good?!
Gigah Drill Breakuh! at 6:30 a.k.a the drill that will pierce the heavens
OMG MY CHILDHOOD! THIS LOOKS AMAZING
😭💙 Been a fan since I was 8  I'm 28
The real Final Fantasy XV that we've wanted all along
I look forward to my grandchildren playing this for the PlayStation 12!
<3 Yay , I’ll do another theme song cover if they do another one .
I'm not gonna Lie,This is the First Official Trailer of KH4!!!Where is Sora Wakes Up in the Apartment of Shibuya,Tokyo,Japan and where he finally see a girl, and to tell him,in what World where he is now!!
So this is the first day of Kingdom Hearts being announced, I'll come back here when it realese
Coming up 2027
Imagine showing someone this trailer back in 2002
Oh my god! This is exactly what I've been waiting for! I can't wait for Kingdom Hearts 4 now! It seems to take place in modern society this time. I know no announcement date has been placed yet, but I really am gonna have to grind in order to finish all the Kingdom Hearts games before KH4 comes out!
Go play Chrono Cross if you want to know what a Square game was like before Tetsuya Nomura lost his mind.  CastleVania Symphony of the Night OST Baroque Guitar MV (Lost Cathedral) https://youtu.be/KyBRZSNjIFs Gundam Unicorn Guitar Anime MV https://youtu.be/zy7aLeW6Ek8 King of Fighters 15 Nameless theme Guitar MV https://youtu.be/m97jSqxIg0w
I'm gonna fucking cry, im both so excited for this and sad im gonna have to wait till 2025 to play kh4. But shit man, its really been 20 entire years of Kingdom Hearts, my love for this game has definitely been the most consistent thing in my entire life
His shoes are so tiny...       R.I.P. clown shoes, you will be missed.
Finally... True Final Fantasy Versus XIII.
#3 on trending. Does my heart proud.
Are you sure you guys wouldn't rather release like 8 spin-off games before releasing another numbered sequel?
I'm going to be the odd one out and say I don't like the new Sora design. They're removing his iconic spikey hair and replacing it with hair that looks like Noctis as a kid. Please keep the long spikey hair, he's not Sora without it!
Don't forget the French dubbing this time
Everyone who sees this: You’re beautiful, and never give up your dreams, you are on this world for a reason!🙏❤🙏❤
Sora is officially looks more like Final Fantasy character.
発売日は2030年かもなー プレステ6がハードだったりして  オンライン対応だったら6Gかも
Another 10 year waiting until release for KH4!How Square keeps hype on there games years before they actual release!
KINGDOM HEARTS 4 Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯WORTH THE WAIT
is this real or am I dreaming?!? THX YOU KH + NOMURA <3
Surprised we didn't have to wait a decade for KH4 I am seriously excited for this game! Everything about it looks amazing!
I wish I could be as excited as everyone else but unfortunately after 3 I just don’t care anymore.
I’m down for round 4. 5. 7. And 11.
A Kaiju-sized Heartless. Who's next, Godzilla?
Thank you for bday gift Square Enix 🧡
Cloud gotta.  Come back this is full final fantasy mode
please dont turn out like kh3, focus on the storyline already
Glorious
Wtffffff this looks 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yeeeessssssss!?!
This dearly beloved about to go crazy 🤭
Can someone tell who's the character narrating in the trailer?
To think, when i was a little potato, I found Kingdom Hearts by accident and now it's been 20 years since and I'm still here for the ride. Man how time and hearts fly.
Man- You'd think the military would react to a giant monster pretty fast...  But hey, Kingdom Hearts 4!
My only request. Get rid of the attractions and bring back actual summons.
i think i will been dead time this game due come out
Nomura really isn't giving up on his Versus 13 dream is he ? 😂
OMG this was way more than I was anticipating and seemingly out of no where. When it just kept going my happy tears just kept going. 😅
This will be selfish of me but I was really hoping that this would've branched into it's own game because this trailer is basically Final Fantasy Versus. I loved KH1 and KH2 and BBS but I was just hoping for this to kind of become it's own game without the Disney elements, kind of like how Nier Automata came from the Drakengard series. Again, my selfish wish.
It's too bad Square Enix doesn't bother to put effort into supporting Nintendo fans properly with the series.   Cloud gaming needs to die.
DAMN SON
AHHHH
Man it took 20 years for our boy to get normal shoes, a somewhat normal haircut AND NO BELTS that it feels weird
I really want to see riku !!!!!!
Você pode pesquisar no universo inteiro por alguém que seja mais merecedor de seu amor e carinho do que você mesmo, e essa pessoa não será encontrada em lugar algum. Você, você mesmo, tanto quanto qualquer um no universo inteiro, merece o seu amor e carinho.  Buda
Uhh....holy shit.. .... This is freaking crazy. .... I guess their just announcing Kingdom Hearts 4 out of the blue like this...  .... wow.... I did not expect to wake up and see this today... But yeah- Freaking Awesome!
What I'm getting from the Japanese vocals isn't translated in the English captions, sigh
hey this looks kinda cool. Too bad I didn't really like kh1
I'm screaming and crying and screaming STRELETZIAAAAAAAAAAA
BEST DAY EVER THIS ROCKS I LOVE KINGDOM HEARTS. DUDE the fact Sora is using his key blade like the lingering will did is giving me hella satisfaction
made my week
STRELIZA!!!!!!
I didn't expect to get these trailers so soon after the event, I'm glad they did it. ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN!!
Yay  I can't believe this happen in the morning yay me and hyper potions comment on this too yay for them
Thank you, even though it just an announcement. I am really happy.
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith. /                               /                                  / /  /   / /
👂⏰🗣️Mathew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luke 3:7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Luke 3:8 Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to  say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. Flee eternal hell🔥 repent of your sins . There is forgiveness  only in  Jesus Christ, no other name is given under heaven that man may be saved. He  died and is now risen at the right hand of God and he makes intercession. Only in him my Lord Jesus Christ is salvation found.  Rom10:9 👂 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼. Jesus Christ is God in the flesh. Came  to destroy the works of the devil.  God commands every man to repent and  beleive the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Flee eternal hell🔥.  He saved me from all my sins and forgave me. I have eternal life only because he died and now is risen at the right hand of God and he ever lives to make intercession for us.⏰🥰😊🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼⏰⏰⏰👐🕯️🙏🏼🥺👂⏰🗣️ The way is narrow and difficult the way. Enter you at the straight gate. If you say you are a Christian but are living like an unbeliever or a devil. You more than likely are not one , you are deceiving your self and other. But there is grace to the one who comes to God through Jesus Christ 🙏🏼.  It will be the end of your self will  and sinful passions, but at the end is eternal life.  There is no sin that Jesus Christ can't deliver you from. So go to him and quit hiding your sins , tell him, repent of them and turn from them.It says beleive the good news  and repent .  He did it with me the chief of sinners. Now I am walking in victory by grace☝🏿☝️ alone. 🙏🏼❤️...
FUCKING A YES
I'm excited for 4 but I just want to know when to sign up for the phone game
I can’t believe this is happening right now
I’m not buying this. Everyone is forgetting how terrible KH3 was? This series should have only 3 games. Kh1, Chain of Memories, and KH2. Everything else is complete trash. I guarantee this game will be trash as well. Look at those organization 13 cloaks. Seriously? Again? It’s gonna be some trash writing all over again.

A New Antagonist That's Not Xenohart Or Any Members Of Organization 13 (It's time for us to move on from The Xenohart Saga)  #10. New Disney Bosses Like The Headless Horseman From The 1949 Disney Adaptation Of The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow, The Giant From Mickey And The Beanstalk, And Bringing Back Judge Claude Frollo From The Hunchback Of Notre Dame (Making it to where you can fight Frollo as a boss this time as opposed to a Candy Rainbow Fruit Bat)
KH music never fail :x
Man you suck Disney. I love Kingdom Hearts but not at the expense of you blatantly having an agenda for child grooming. If anyone here has a spine they will not buy this until this issue is resolved immediately.
I wonder if the people who hated kh3 would still be hyped for kh4
Lol when I saw the video link I said I guess there is a fourth in the making. It’s looking good by graphics. I’m excited
I'm excited about Kingdom hearts 4 but when are they going to learn that we don't want mobile games
I wonder if Sora will become the Lost Master wandering from world to world, reality to reality. Or maybe he has to prevent that from happening.
I'm not gonna lie. The best thing about Missing Link is that Remix lol
"If you do leave this world behind. don't expect to return from which you came"  am i overthinking this or am i not understanding what this means?   Does this means that this game might be an open exploration game where you can choose between worlds but since he can't leave this one then he get an alternative ending where he doesn't go back to it's original if he does?
KH4 looks so realistic and like non-cartoony anymore and lowkey I kinda hate it like I love big eyed big feet sora 😭
Oh my gosh!!!! this looks insane!!!! So realistic, I love it!!!!
So I guess this is a good moment to play all the games (I have the 1.5 + 2.5 remix in PS4 but I haven't started it yet, I only have to buy Kingdom Hearts 3)
im still sad we cant actually play union x.. id be happy if it was single player without certain events and things..
Gonna wait the official release till 2078 for PS8?
Give us a proper version of the KH saga for switch, we crying for physical games at this point
This feels like KH3 all over again. Not a good sign considering how that turned out.
I'm so excited for it. Never played a kingdom hearts game. But this looks amazing.
Omg I didn't see this coming
His face just doesn't look right to me
If Zootopia gets in this game, my reaction will be; OMG!!!
I will be honest I'll wait 10 years if they give the 4th game more time then the 3rd. KH2 will still be the best till then
Never played it
Goofy speaking Japanese makes me question my own level of intelligence.
Is that Hades at the end?
Thank you for the great video this really inspired me to keep working hard and believe in what I create. Whoever's reading this I hope your goals also work out. - Tom's Audio Show
holy moly! another crappy mobile phone game that requires you to spend 100 bucks her week to compete lol. great. the franchise is sadly dead
KH4 MULTIVERSE,NORMAL WORLD 🌎
https://youtu.be/MmxQR1qr6r4
Remeber of Brazil this time
There better be ff characters. I want the hardest sephiroth fight to date in this one.
Hey yall 🙂 how yall doing? 💪💯🔥🔥 if anyone wants to do a collab I'm down to I'm not that good but I'm trying 😂 I appreciate yall reading this and hope you have a better day then before reading this much love y'all 💙💪💯🙏🔥💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Even the haters gotta admit KH4 looks INCREDIBLE.
Can we have it in spanish?
Ah, yes. Everyone gets a grappling hook gimmick these days~
I'M SO EXCITED LET'S GOOOOOO
6:52 OH ME VENGOOOOOOOO
4:42 The top right 😳
20 years later
This is f'n sick dude!  Probably 2024 at the latest is when I think it will come out
So I have questions, is that girl Strelitzia? Was that Darkside thing a Heartless or something else? Was that forested area Endor from Star Wars? Who attacked Donald and Goofy? It sounded and looked like Hades
I might be the only one that doesn't like the way sora look or what happened when he ran towards the heartless, I just feel like it's not kingdom hearts at that point
A ver que waa sale primero, Kingdom Hearts 4 o el Digimon Survive.
10/10 best game already. Sora has a grappling hook
Wow! Has it really been 20 years motherfucker dude. I’m 21 and still remember playing this at a really really young age
I love the concept but the unrealistic CGi anime art style in the photorealistic environments looks really, really awkward.
Will this also feature at least 50% lgbt+ and black people? #BoycottDisney
Holy hell, Kingdom Hearts, you revived my love for you 💕 🖤
EU NAO CONSIGO PROCESSAR ATÉ AGORA
this seriously has been the best day i’ve ever woken up to in a long time, happy 20 years to my favorite series of all time. excited to keep on growing along with it and with everyone!
5:06 So we not gonna talk about *Strelitzia?* She Bruno now or something?
AAAAA EU VOU ENLOUQUECER
Can we not have mobile games for any of this
Brah. As Kingdom Hearts being my favorite video game series, I'm so excited for this!!! but please PLEASE don't have us waiting 5+ years for this! 5 years is an insane amount of time to wait for a game much less 10 years!!! 3 years would be ideal, maybe 4-5 if the game needs to be delayed.
https://youtube.com/shorts/vQEr5XoMdpI?feature=share
So excited 💖
So no Union X collection?
Tomorrow!
Lightning Farron, someplace in Europe after beating FFXIII-LR: ugh there’s monsters appearing in Japan, guess I’m gonna have to do a modeling tour over there to find out what’s up. HOPE! FANG! GET UR ASSES IN GEAR WERE GOING TO SHIBUYA!
The vast majority of us waited our entire lives (our youth, specifically) for Kingdom Hearts 3. Yet, we are NOW in the timeline of discussion our predictions on Kingdom Hearts 4. This is all so surreal, but I’m indescribably happy. This is such a great news on my birthday. May your heart be your guiding key!!!
OH SNAP
First two trailers had me like: ugh enough of this prequel stuff!  Last trailer: ooooooh boy this is gonna be interesting!
IRON MAN AND SORA VS DARTH VADER AND BOBA FETT WHEN?!?
that ending though, what did goofy and donald find, or rather what found them?
I'M THRILLED ABOUT KH4!!! I hate that they made the mobile games tho
Is that an AT-AT foot at 4:42 ?
Eh im not gonna let CGI and cool trailers get me too pumped anymore...I'm expecting to be disappointed
Better have Sephiroth in it!
The plot thickens.. yes even more
Now this... is what you call INNOVATION!! The absolute evolution of this series is outrageously incredible
Hey, uh.. Y’all notice Advent Children Cloud was a trophy that Missing Link dude used?
This is amazing!! My favorite series as a 9 year old kid
Honestly I would drop the Disney shat and go just full Final Fantasy or Square Enix games that way they don't have to deal with Disney and their IP identity crisis.  I always wanted them to expand the Final Fantasy world and not Disney.
Glad to see there is a 4th installment thought I was looking at a fan made one and I really wanna see how kingdom hearts link plays out in the series like the other side games have
I’m about to lose my god damn mind.
Yes, Kingdom Hearts 4! Let's go, I really love this franchise. Did not expect to see a small gameplay, it looks really amazing.
This Might be a Good Spot To Find Some Ingredients!
Good to hear kingdom hearts going to have the 4th part. Buy I was expecting a TV show in dinsey+.
PLEASE! BRING BACK HALLOWEEN TOWN, RADIENT GARDEN! AND ALL THE FINAL FANTASY FIGURES! SPECIALLY SEPHIROTH BATTLES! KH3 MISSED A LOT OF STUFF!
GET REAL:
I am here for the music
KH4 looks insane 🔥🔥
I can't wait to play KH4 with my great grandkids
geforce leak was real 😉
HOLY CRAP IM GOING IN FREAKING SANE RIGHT NOW IMMM SO GODAMN HYPE KINGDOMH HEARTS YESSS !!!!!!
WHOOOOOOOOA!!!!!! SICK!!!!! I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO SEE ALL THREE!
Cant wait to kingdom hearts 4 in 2032 🤣🤣🤣
A list of some of the things I hope they improve from KH3: 1. Better voice acting and no more cheesy lines 2. A LOT less floaty fighting mechanics - the KH2 fighting was almost perfect 3. BRING BACK DRIVE FORMS and get rid of some of the broken drive keyblade systems that honestly become repetitive and boring. I remember grinding out the Valor, Wisdom, Master, and Final forms to unlock skills and abilities that made KH2 a lot more fun. 4. Fix the summon forms! KH3 had some of the most broken and OP summon systems 5. for the love of god don't add too many Disney rides and special attack meters, this quickly makes gameplay repetitive and boring! 6. The gummi ship exploration and missions were almost perfect! Please work off KH3 gummi ship gameplay, that part was loads of fun  I hope the community adds to this list and the development team sees our critiques from the last game and improves on it. I love how they listened and fixed some of the fighting animations in KH3 after the update but it is still way too floaty.
This tells me everything I need to know, which is that I won't be watching anymore trailers from here on out.
20th anniversary??? Gosh
More gatcha, no thanks
KH4 looks stunning! How they continue to evolve the franchise with its fans is a work of art! I was in 1st grade when I played KH1! Now, I'm a doctor! <3
So awesome I can't wait for this game☺!
Damn Sora has got some crinkly and mighty feet
Nice wishlist version of final fantasy
Did Donald and Goofy run into Hades (from Hercules) in the end
Thanks Square Enix  Thanks Nomura  From the bottom of my heart ...  Those games motivated me through life to never give up , i attempted suicide back in 2014 jumping off from the 5th floor of a building and i can clearly say if it weren't for this game series i wouldn't be here anymore The story and gameplay had certain problems but sticking with it is rewarding us with the best gift ever I am now 22 and the stories you guys made will always have a special place in my memories
HES SO PRETTYY OH MY GOD LOOK AT HIM
Certainly was not expecting photorealistic Kingdom Hearts, or for Sora to still be the protagonist, or any Kingdom Hearts at all so soon really, but I'm open to it if it's this different!
Now begs the question... When can we expect Kingdom Hearts IV to release? I genuinely hope it releases sometime this year or early 2023.
BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Square Enix, PLEASE make the fighting mechanics a LOT less floaty. KH2 boots on the ground was the way to go!
Cool, they didn't  retcon the ending. Sora is still dead.
Who wants KH4 to be an experience like Elden Ring? Not really become a souls like, I love the KH like style, since KH has also redefined the genre, but i mean in the exploration.  Big world, vivid and full, nice interactions with side quest lines, hidden places to explore, nice main quest with many approaches to it. I can still deal with the more linear style KH has, it pleases me and helps me in not getting lost (as I am right now in Elden Ring since I have some trouble with focusing in open world games hehehe)
okay I'll prepare my patience, a game like this is impossible to wait for a while
My only complaint about kh4… his shoes are small
Hannah Montana's world annouced. Finally!!! 😍😍
Who was the person that Donald and goofy saw. Let's go!  I want names and phone numbers lol
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💜
My only minor nitpicking complaints for this is that I don't like how Sora looks. He looks too realistic and doesn't look like he's from Kingdom Hearts. I miss the cartoon-y anime style he has from the previous game. Heck, his shoes looks normal now and doesn't have his clown shoes anymore. I just hope he just looks like this just for this world he's in only. And I don't like the logo. It looks too simple and doesn't have that stylish font.  Other than that, this game looks so awesome and I can't wait to play it!!! I AM HYYYPED!!!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT 🤯🤯🤯
Kingdom… Heart… 4… Just shut up and my MONEY!
Oh God, we don't need to wait so long for kh iv, not like' kh 3 that sooooo long to wait.perhaps can play it soon
SO HYPED FOR THIS!
This trailer is SOOOOO GOOD!!!
I’m so pumped to see what happens next I can’t wait to see and play it 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This will be lit
LETS FUCKING GO
So... Mandalorian area in KH4?
i did NOT know they'd still be able to use disney characters!!!! i am intrigued
4:42 STAR WARS CONFIRMED, AT-ST FOOT!
I hope we get a Zootopia and Star Wars world for KH4. That's something we need.
The animation is insane. They about to make the opening a live action.
Ayooooo KINGDOM HEARTS 4 BABYYYYY
Super excited! Also, is my boi doing the Keyblade whip like Lingering Will?!
I am electric rn don’t touch me ‼️
BEHOLD! Sora with regular freaking shoes!!
hell yeah
This fucking sucks
I'm pretty sure they're gonna focus on realistic looking worlds in this one, due to the advanced graphics they're now using, just like they mostly focused on Pixar and 3D Disney movies in KH3. My bets are on Star Wars, Marvel and maybe live action Disney movies like Maleficent or remakes, and I have to admit I'm not so happy about it... But I guess we'll have to wait and see! Anyway it's always good to know Sora's back. Because it means Riku's not far behind!!
THANK YOU NOMURA YOU GOD
Either this is a 10 day late April fools joke or I'm seeing this is a real. Okay reality time........ How deep are the claws of the "Ethics department" will in this?
SANS IN KINGDOM HEARTS?!?!?!
And so they milk ya'll again... Behold Kingdom Hearts 3.5 and then later down the line Kingdom Hearts 3.8. Oh oh! Birth by Sleep 2. and finally after 4-5 years of waiting a KH4! and repeat!
Jesus, has it really been that long already?
Ya'll scared me for a minute, I thought this was gonna be some chibi paper mario lookin bullshit.
MEU DEUS EU NÃOQACREDITO GENTE EU TO PASSANDO MUITO MAL EM CASA QUE ISSO MEU DEUS É ISSO MESMO???? TETSUYA NOMURA PODE EXPLICAR ISSO??? TEREMOS OU NÃO UMA CONTINUAÇÃO VULGO KH4????? gente que LINDO kkkkkkk BOBA
It would have been more fitting if the real world scene took place at Disneyland Tokyo.
am i the only one that didnt thing it was sora in the kh4 trailer??? he looks so different
Alright guys, see you in 5 years when this baby is out
Maybe we will go to live action Disney worlds this time.
They announced it on my birthday im so blessed one of my greatest gifts
I am already missing Sora's shoes, haha. You will be missed! ❤️ Also- super excited for further updates! ❤️
Imagine instead Dolan and goofy finds a DS bonfire.
Well...now i need a new pair of pants.
KH4 looks so good
im old
Its such a shame that the character designs for Missing Link are stuck in a mobile game that uses KH3's terrible floaty combat. They are so cool and look more like industrial revolution era FF characters.
Please give sora back his old kh1/2 hairstyle
I'm not crying, you're crying
Hope KH4 will also be for the PS4 and have Kairi be playable for more than a boss fight.
im not cryinig your crying
I hope I don't die before this game comes out 😅
I'm still glad Sora finally came to Smash!
Who want to fight said heartless
For the love of God please do not take 10-15 years to drop kh4. It looks soooooooooo awesome! 😭🖤
Shatter all expectations.
Just hope the PC version doesn't end up as an Epic exclusive again. :-/
So we all just gonna gloss over the weirdly hyper-realistic forest place and not mention how much it looks like the moon of Endor?  Especially with that weird cone thing that looks like at AT-ST foot ? (Upper right corner at 4:43)
Another mobile game... NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Well, see you all in 2028 when KH4 comes out 😔
6:26 Giga Drill! lol (But seriously this looks so cool!)
Ребята, будет ли он на ру локализации? Игра то идеальная
It looks so good, but now I'm afraid that the Disney worlds will clash too hard with this realistic style
sheesh!!!
my mind is so confused. thats sora, but it doesnt really look exactly like sora.
Everyone needs to hear the kingdom heart song @Purplexxer did
Pues como sea como el 3 ya paso!
Disney should include characters from  pixars A bugs Life. 🐜🐜🐜🐜  AND also from Coco. 💀  Now that they bought Fox include worlds from Thumbelina and Anastasia. 👑
KH4??? EVERYTHING LOOKS SO FINAL FANTASY LIKE ITS AMAZING 😱
The mobile games look terrible hope kh4 comes out soon SORA!
Boy I sure look forward to my grandkids play KH4 in 50 years.
I'm way more excited for kh missing link than kh4 tbh
I can't believe it's real! We now just have to wait 10 more years for it to release lol.
Hope Kingdom Hearts 4 comes to the Switch.
Kingdom Hearts 4?!!! What?!!! Wow. Is it going to take another 10 years before we get the game? ;)
I still think kingdom hearts 3 was a let down I can’t believe people are gasping at this.. looks like kingdom hearts SFM demos
Where can I find full versions of the songs used in these trailers?
4:03 Kingdom Hearts IV? 💜
Rtx Off: okay cool  Rtx on: WAIT GO BACK
My favorite trio is back
I think hades is at the end
oh my god
Sora looks alot like Hope from FFXIII
When your ip is the horse that is still dead
Star Wars AT-AT walker leg at 4:42. Would love to see a Marvel world too, as well as Treasure Planet, Incredibles, Jungle Book, Atlantis and Brother Bear! What worlds would you guys like to see? Can't believe we all woke up to KHIV!!
But damn the graphics tho they look to real I though it was a movie 😳
So is nobody gonna talk about how we’re getting a Star Wars world?
Que seja Dublado em Português do Brasil!
This is beautiful, just building up more for us KH fans, definitely wasn't the news I was expecting right now, but boyyyy I'm am happy to see it. Blessed square enix and happy 20th anniversary to this masterpiece of a game.
I'm gonna be smart this time and not buy until I see what it has to offer kh3 was a very big disappointment
So excited for KH4.  The top 5 worlds I would absolutely love to see are as follows:  Lilo & Stitch (tropical islands) Wreck it wrelph (the internet) Cinderella (with the town) Toy story (With Zurg as villain) Fox and the hound (great beginning world)  I know some of these aren't likely, but I would love to see them.
Have they ever released a trailer with Donald and Goofy speaking Japanese?
I have obtained the status condition: V I B R A T I N G  And it will only go away once the game has dropped  (Seriously though, development team, take your time. A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is eternally bad. I can be patient I'm just so excited)
Soy el mas feliz del mundo se viene Kingdom Hearts 4 😭😭😭😭
Idk why I’m happy and sad at the same time 🥺😩 I’m glad that there’s KH4 but I dun really know how to feel about the Final Fantasy art style 😩
There better be more worlds based on 2D Disney movies after III's 3:1 ratio of CG to 2D based worlds. There also should be a world count similar to II after III having half the world count to its previous two mainline entries.  I also want worlds based on Atlantis and Treasure Planet. I really, really do.
yooo is that an at-st at the top right could we possibly get Endor
BLUR FAMME STA REACTION ZIO PORCO
It’s really hard to believe that 20 years have passed since the first Kingdom Hearts masterpiece.  🔑 ❤️🙏🏻
HOLY MOTHER OF DISNEY! I was totally unprepared!
Now that it was confirmed that the bs Rey storyline is now non-canon we COULD see Ahsoka "The true chosen one" make her glorious return to help out  sora an the gang after seeing that small Starwars hint from that forest scene.  LESSS GOOO!
Unnamed world Based on "The Jungle Book" for Kingdom Hearts IV?
Hope they wont make the same mistake and release game 10 years after announcement ;D
This is why I want paid skins in smash, I would gladly pay for this outfit
Nevertheless, I anticipated that the new saga or two would come into play. The real trick is try to get in and make to story better before Kingdom Hearts' current convoluted story line would end up ruining the franchise's reputation beyond repair.
So no kingdom hearts on steam?? 👎
holy shit sans
real works kingdom hearts… meh! 🤷🏾‍♂️
I won’t even be disappointed if it comes out in 2030 because holy shit that looks fucking epic and I want the game to have that exact same feeling
Man missing link looks like gacha galore with the magic attacks figures.....😭
WHAT
It bothers me that they're just retroactively making Xehanort into this misunderstood quasi-good guy now. Like, you can't just pull something like that out of your ass after spending 20 years portraying him as the main antagonist of your franchise.
Not traditionally a fan of mobile games, and still haven't caught up on the complete story. But still, as an early fan who first played HK2 on the original PS2 version: all of this news is super exciting!
6:46 Who is that guy next to the Master? Luxu is in the realm of light
YES lets goooooo!!!!!!! Amazing, looking forward to it.
As a huge fan of the series, not really hyped for this at all. The series peaked in 2, and after that became a jumbled mess. It ended in 3, not neatly, but it did. Let it rest. It feels like it's being milked for all its worth now. Plus KH doesn't really fit this realistic vibe at all. Feels so out of place. Might as well be Final Fantasy XVII.
Am I the only one who doesn't really like the more realistic style they're going for with KH4? I hate how with modern consoles, every bit of stylization or cartoonyness is getting shafted for the sake of Making things look realistic. KH3 had the perfect visual style that blended well with the Disney characters while still being in high definition. This Sora's feet aren't even big.
God I'm so glad I've stopped caring
A Dark Inferno/ Dark side fusion!?
Who else is looking forward to playing this in 2042?
Strelitzia lookin' pretty cool though she's still super mysterious.
I can't wait to play this when it releases in 2028.
Also can't we just be done with Sora already
I am going to cry
Can't wait to play it in 2037
Where isssss yozoraaaaaaaaa
God.. probably a 2027 release date xD.
Was that Hades in the end? Blue flame, mention of the "afterworld"...Wonder what everyone else thinks.
don't mess this up, please!
I really enjoyed that was a surprising trailer I Really can’t wait
First Sora in Smash and now we have KHIV?! WHAT A GREAT TIME TO BE A KHFAN!! 🤩
oh nice he has converse as for his new pair of shoes!
5:04 OMG!!!! That's Lauriam/Marluxia's sister, Strelitzia!!😱
Really hope all of KH4 looks less photorealistic than what we seen so far. Doesn't feel very KH, it feels more like FFXV. Heartless and Organization walking around Not-Japan? Super weird as hell
KH4!?! THIS NOT A DRILL!!! THANK YOU SQUARE!!!
Oh. My. God!!!! Dude I’m so ready for this
KH IV for me seems like the redemption for the cancellation of Final Fantasy Versus XIII from Tetsuya Nomura san. Mind blown. Redemption really well-done Tetsuya-san!! 🤯👏
Now this bring me back to 2013 when we saw the first kh3 trailer, I can't wait for 2035 to see this kh4...
cuando llegara kingdom  hearts a switch mexico ?
AHHHHHHHHHH
Looks like trash
more???? Hug.....
Now lets hope it release before the 25th anniversary xD
OMG THANK YOU FOR THIS ❤
How do I become part of the closed beta?
kh4 is probably going to be a shitshow like kh3
Also is that Hades at the end?!?!?!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Yall ready to wait 13 more years?
the おい、どこにいくんだよat the end was so cool lol
How fuck  nombra just knocked the wind out of me😭😭
Started the video feeling with extreme disappointment, ended with extreme excitement.
IS THAT AN AT-ST FOOT AT 4:42?!?!?!?!
Is Strelitzia the one who greets Sora?
Um why was my comment removed? It didn't say any rude?  Anyways I'm 50/50 3 left a bad taste  hoping they improve on the gameplay and story, don't take 5 years just to release it,Disney relaxed a lot and let  Square go to work, story not being a mess
So either Kingdom hearts 4 is gonna to be on PS4 and PS5, Nintendo switch system, Xbox one, and last but not least everyone fan favorite PC where we come up future mods making. And Sora new outfit from kingdom hearts 4 should also be super smash ultimate mods.
As long as this is on Xbox day one I'm super excited.
I am high as fuck and oh my goood this Is so amaziiiing!!!!! I am so hiiiiiiiiiigh!!!!!!!
KINGDOM HEARTS 4!!!!! YES
OMG?!?! Kingdom HEARTS 4 already?!!!! Out on Next-gen PS5/XBOX Series X consoels/???? 2028???? 😮
KH4 😳😳😳😭😭😭🤩🤩 and the tease of Donald and goofy in the end 🤣😭😭🥺😱😱
Kingdom Hearts IV looks clean... or should I say...  Simple and Clean!
What is the music used for missing link? I never played KH but that track sounded pretty good.
Yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I can't wait till KH 4 comes out 2030
What a great surprise
4:41 finally, star wars
I am HYPED for Kingdom hearts 4! It looks amazing so far. I can't wait to see more in the future
O HELL NAH SORTA IN DA REAL WORLD
Kh4 looks so… uninspired. It looks like they took the stock UE5 assets and assets you can download online and slapped it together. The city just absolutely does not feel like kh. The only thing that did was the main character and the bad guys.
Sora rocking the drip
Best birthday gift ever!
Can’t wait to play in 8 years! !remindme@1/1/2032
I can’t emotionally explain what I’m feeling right now….. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
epic exclusive - downvoted
Looks amazing and is nostalgic to see the characters back and grown but holy KH3 got me brain dead that i have no expectations for square games anymore.
OMG Sora's BEAUTIFUL 😍😍😍
All I gotta say is they better include some square enix characters. KH3 was somewhat disappointing without them.
My expectations are completely blown away! I knew there was a KH event but was expecting just a dark road release date and maybe some funko pop figures and pins. Glad I was completely wrong!
This would be good it it were original, but since it's strayed far from what it was, it's not as appealing. Then again, I've never played the games in my life, so what should I say about it?
When the "KINGDOM HEARTS IV" title popped up I went from smiling and being excited to almost yelling LOL Looking forward to all of this
Porfavor no otra vez con la organización XIII ya paren con eso, busquen otros argumentos.
4:43 This might be a good spot to find some ingredients
Good news this morning! 👀
Giga ....Drillllll....Breaaaaakerrrrrrrrrr
Let’s wait for another 6 years 🤣
But what about Donald and Goofy? Where or who are they looking for?
OMG THIS IS WHY I LOVE KINGDOM HEARTS THIS IS ABOUT TO BE EPIC
Hope you guy don't crew the story too much like with kh3 and... did I just see a final fantasy versus style game play??? Really hoping it blows my mind!!!
Thank you for the video! You have a very interesting channel! And I am 20 years old, unfortunately I am disabled, I live with my parents. I never had friends in real life, like in relationships, I spent my whole life on the Internet. And if you suddenly feel bad at heart, I made this comment only to wish you good health and mood. Rejoice and communicate with a friend. remember this comment. Go ahead! I'm waiting for this. Good luck!
Seriously, it's amazing 😍 but I'm I the only weirded out by soras new design 🤔
4:42 that is an AT-ST
Hype, but kh4 looks really early in development. Still hype though
Woah. Sora in the real world. Also is that Donald and Goofy going to Hades because of death?
6:29 Sora: "MY HEART IS THE DRILL THAT WILL PIERCE THE DARKNESS!" Simon, somewhere: "That's not how the line goes!"
Hades is the gate keeper damn!!! I thought we were done with the disney stuff
Yo KH4 looking clean though
I think the artstyle could change through the course of the game. I know it sounds weird, but if you look at the models of Goofy and Donald, they look exactly like in KH3. I think the artstyle and look of Sora is bound to the world he is in. Maybe if he storywise finds a way to go back to his own world he will look like we know him. But I don't know if that is possible because, that would require two engines, for example Unreal Engine 4 and whatever engine Final Fantasy 15 and so on use.
The trailer LITERALLY BROUGHT ME TO TEARS SEEING IT! I’m so fucking hyped for a fourth
That gacha game looks pretty cool
this means the invidia leak is real and were getting ff9 remake and dragons dogma 2
Started playing this franchise when I wasn’t even a teen yet. KH3 came out when I was 20 and now I’m 22… wow time flies man. Gonna be playing this one so much when it does come out. Please let it be fully complete on launch 🤞😭
DAMN, JOJO AND KINGDOM HEARTS ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THE SAME YEAR????? IM SO GODDAMN HAPPY!!!!!!!
I hope hope hope friends could join to help with battles!! 🤞
Just got extra moist with that KH4 video
KH4 IS FREAKING REAL!!!! I am so HYPED!!!
Holy   Shit
Bro but for real tho hades been in all the games now. They have to be doing something for him.
KH4. your in a city. IDC sora need to team up with the avengers.
👏👏👏 very nice ❤️❤️❤️ Can’t wait for all of it!!
Already two new KH games? This is so surreal.
Kingdom hearts spider man edition
The person that Donald and Goofy are looking for has to be Hades....that blue fire gives it away!
Alright, that giant Heartless looks a bit too much like Chaos from Dissidia.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!! . . .  I'm so happy 😭!!!!!
Well, looks like Nintendo have to wait again for launch Zelda BOWT2
i'm super happy that KH4 has been announced don't get me wrong but i'm also worried if the entire game takes place in quadratum exploring Disney worlds is what makes kingdom hearts so special
SORA BECAME REAL
This new Final Fantasy looks good.
anyone remember when they said they would bring KH3 to the newly released ps3 systems, yeah those where good times, well only 15 more year wait and we will be seeing this on the ps6 or 7 what ever is out at that point. cant wait
WAIT W H A T !?!??!?!
BEST GAME IN THE WHOLE WORLD
Well, this was unexpected.
When the end of Melody of Memories said that Sora was in a “world between worlds”, I did not expect it to be real life
what happen to Master of Master voice?? Where is Tomokazu Sugita??
4:42 AT-ST foot! Top right!
I don’t like how they want to make all their games look like Final Fantasy 15.
Ok i know that i have the groundwork for a more consistently structured lore based Kingdom Hearts anime series to be made thanks to KHI, KHCoM, KHII, KH358/2, KHBBS, KHCoded, KHDDD, KHBBSV2, and KHIII, with a bit of Union X, Dark Road, and Melody of Memories sprinkled in for good measure, though nothing that references any visits to the disney worlds mentioned in those games because again more consistant lore. I ain't putting up with implications of the interactions with the isolated worlds having been done an infinite amount of times...if Aqua, Terra and Ven met cinderella during the events of her movie, then Cinderella will be 10 yrs older during the events of KHI. I guess i could incorporate ideas from the live action movies like why certain disney villains turned to the darkside, thus leading up to the animated movie events... But i don't know if i should save that for backstories involving the implied Disney Verse Keyblade wielders and mentors or not. Though then again the destruction of Daybreak Town could have spread to a number of other keyblade schools or masters thus forcing them to seal their powers away by severing the connections between worlds thus creating each world's respective hearts. Like let's say Pedro Madrigal from encanto was a wielder and he sealed away his home from the encroaching darkness at the cost of his life thus creating the candle which acts as the heart of the freshly severed world of the Encanto. At least until Mirabel comes into the picture and her kidnapping when Maleficent is searching for the 7 maidens who oddly enough seem to represent the 7 heavenly virtues thus explaining why Wendy Darling, Mulan, and Ariel didnt fit her criteria because they already had the respective virtues that they represented. And wow am i getting sidetracked. But Seriously people if you dont get Kingdom Hearts worldbuilding vibes from the events in Encanto, i would be shocked.  My point is lets see what KHIV has in store and will it help enhance the ideas and changes that could help bring the KH series to life with more consistant lore, or if we should just scrap any idea of having Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Max being Sora's world traveling companions throughout the series? Time will only tell. Hit the like button if you want to support my endeavor to bring KH to life as an anime. Or head to my deviantart of the same name to check out some mockup character concepts. I could always use the support and perhaps the constructive critism.
This is real?
Oh My God Kingdom Hearts 4!!! Upcoming On Nintendo Switch!!!
sora took 20 years to become an isekai protagonist despite looking like one since the first game in the series. All jokes aside I'm hyped as all hell for this.
🤣 please even if they make more games after this let’s have some conclusion! It’s been 20 years and nobody even knows why Sora was having those weird thoughts lately lol
Please add Final fantasy characters in this one please
My man took not being able to make Versus XIII *way* too personally.  But we eating for it, so HELL YEAH
So Happy seriously !!!
Interesting Still a shame Union Cross is a mobile game, the style *really* doesnt fit the story going on over there I have, no idea what the 2nd one even looks like... another mobile game? Please no, my phone can't handle 3d games man, and battery life is garbage 4 looks . . . interesting. Looks similar to the hype trailers for Versus and Rex, but, history may repeat, so just gonna patiently see how this goes.
GIGA DRILL BREAKEEEEEEEEEEEEEER  This drill attack is a fucking direct refference. The footage is simply the same, lol.
KH4? More like Kingdom Hearts: Into the Human-Verse
*begins pissing faring and shitting at the same time*
So cool! Although I’m out of date/haven’t really kept up with Kingdom Hearts since I played 3 and I forget how it ends.   Could anyone possibly give me a refresher I’d appreciate it:)
Is that Hades at the end?
Is it sora???
No doubt the off-screen character speaking to Donald and Goofy at the end of the trailer was none other than Hades (from Hercules). 🔥
unbelievable hype. if the game is more than a press triangle simulator then I will be happy. kh3 just didn't feel like kingdom hearts to me. this looks promising
ALREADY?! HAS IT ALREADY BEEN THAT LONG?!
OH MY GOSH FINALLY OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!!!!!
Muito feliz com essa surpresa, agora Square, espero que não cometa o mesmo erro e dessa vez tenha legendas em português br
the clothes sora is wearing are a totally different cut and style  and it doesnt look like him. i cant describe it tho. its like he looks older and younger at the same time
NicoB is gonna flip his shit.
Is KH4 using Unreal Engine 5? It looks SICK right from jump!
Kingdom Hearts Odyssey
Bro, the craziest thing about this trailer isn't even that the game is being announced. It's the Shoes!!!!! SORA'S SHOES ARE SMALLER???!!!! WHERE MY OVER THE TOP BIG FEET!!!!?????
Was that Strelitzia?
Holy helheim yes!!!
Another fucking mobile game? Holy shit how lazy can you guys be?
I honestly hope that they change the engine for KH4. KH3's design felt outdated with the invisible walls and stiff animations.
This looks absolutely terrible. What even is KH anymore?
Here we go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This looks great!    I can't wait for this to release in 2030 on the PS7! I'm hyped!
I can't wait to see sora sing we dont talk about bruno
Ngl I was half expecting Donal to look like an actual duck after seeing sora
Everything about this is amazing!!! Endor?!? MODERN SORA!?!? MOM?!? LETS GOOOO LIKE THIS IF YALL WANT THIS SOONER THEN 6 years from now
Sorry the last game was built for noobs and sales, Kingdom Hearts died with part 2
Bro. I have no words. This is next level.
Welp, by the looks of it, it looks like they threw the charm KH had out the window. A realistic modern day setting is a huge buzz kill..hopefully that's just a small part of the game
Kh4 I’m so happy I’m gonna cry now I just gotta wait 3-6 years for it to release lmao
I just woke up and its the best thing to wake up too.
Yo lets Go KH4😁
I'm glad they teased Kingdom Hearts 4 because if it was just 2 low effort mobile games I would have been upset.
i hope thats kingdom hearts 4 is having a german voiceover like the 1st and 2nd game
STRELITZIA!!! I. CRYING!!!!
You made a full new game for mobile running on UE4 and couldn't deliver a decent physical port to Switch, what a joke.
KH4..
Ight so that’s def hades. Donald and goofy are def gonna find their own way to sora lol
Well I hope you ladies and gentlemen are ready to wait an eon before kh4 comes out because there's no way it comes out in this decade
Sora with a grappling hook is something I AM TOTALLY ON BOARD FOR!!!!!!!
So Kingdom Hearts 4 is essentially FF Versus… alright. Can we at least get rid of the black coats? This is getting tedious now from a guy who’s whole schtick is design.
Bro this will be out once I get married and have kids
I love the new art design for KH4, however, I'm scared at how Disney characters will look in it. They made it work for pirates of the Caribbean but this is a whole new level!
RU TÔ CHORANDO VAU SE FUDER  POR FAVOR, KINGDOM HEARTS 4 EM PT BR, PLEASE
Union x Dark Road looks like a South Park action scene
At 4:42 you can see an AT-ST foot at the top right. Star Wars (Endor) confirmed.
HELL YEAH ❤
Man. There's no better time to be a Kingdom Hearts fan than now.
Sora has NORMAL SHOES?!?!?!?!!? He's got actual fucking DRIP? Hello? Sora the Drip GOD!!!  I would've had Kairi be the first playable character and have her going to Disney worlds, and then when you play as Sora you go to FF worlds.
KH4 Looks so damn good Sora looks so damn good everything is damn good
4:41 ...AT-ST foot?
Holy shit!
*Throws wallet at screen* Just take my damn money already! 😂😍
Omg this is Sans, kingdom hearts X undertale confirm
Where's Verum Rex?
God....I wish I felt something. Anything. I just feel. Empty. Even anger would be better.
When you think is just another event and it isn't!!😍😍
this will be kingdom hearts in 2018
Everyone: OMG KINGDOM HEARTS 4 Me: No Steam ports for Kingdom Hearts? No one likes Epic Games Store
If this comes to pc and it's epic shitstore exclusive I'm gonna be disappointed
I was 8 years old when Kingdom Hearts 1 game out in 2001, now as a 28-year-old, still in love with this series and am looking forward to its future!
OMG! Seriously, I was not expecting a mainline sequel to be announced so soon. My body is so not ready!
The best game series, ever. Take my money
I genuinely wonder if they're going to just keep Haley Joel for the role since Sora's visibly getting older or if they're going to finally replace him with someone new? It'll be interesting to see. It was so good to see Donald and Goofy again. It's exciting, but from the way it's looking, they may not get to reunite in this game until the end or not at all. I'm excited to see where KH4 leads; The Lost Master "Arc" immediately gives it all away that we're gonna be seeing a whole new trilogy based on these guys so that's a thing to think about.  How many spinoff games will we see THIS time, I wonder? It'd feel wrong if KH started to have numbered games more frequently... Something would just feel off about it. Not against it, but man, it'd be weird to live in an era where KH's main titles actually release in a steady, few year timeframe.
IS THAT HADES AT THE END?!!?!! SOOOOOO HYPED FOR THIS!!!!
well done!!!!
man, i just happen to look if there was any news about kingdom hearts and now i find that KH4 was revealed today...
KH4?! LET'S GOOO!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MEEEEE!!!!!!! Thank you for not making me wait another decade for more news on this game series Nomura. And also Sora's new design looks so good. I want my boy's new kicks sooo bad.
this is looking incredible. thank you for all you have done, and all you will do
Verum Rex do be looking fine. Thank Nomura.
Can't wait to see how this goes bc this a really amazing franchise I love it and love soras new look this is gonna be good game I can bet glad to see they are making another one
Was having a terrible day until I saw this
WAT!?!?! BRUH, I WASN'T EXPECTING ANNOUNCEMENT SO SOON!!! This HAS to be a PS5 exclusive.
Omg are they bringing Hades back? omg is he in Yozoraworld?
W!!  💜💜💜🔥🔥🔥🔥🗝🗝 IM SO PUMPED!!!
keyblade can do giga drill break now
For those who Don't know the girl with Sora is Strelitzia from Union X. She was killed right before the keyblade war started which is why she is here.
Sora just got reverse isekaied. lol
They finally letting nomura in control!!!  Thank you Disney
KINGDOM HEARTS 4 beginning soon ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️💯💯💯💯💯💯 Happy 20th Anniversary Disney Square Enix Kingdom Hearts ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🔑🔑🔑🔑🔑🔑🔑
Epic
Honestly the biggest shocker is that Sora doesn't have gargantuan feet
I just love how it implies Donald and Goofy tried looking for Sora in the Kingdom Hearts equivalent of hell
I'm actually a bit turned off by the hi-resolution character models of KH4.
I need that new version of Dearly Beloved from Missing Link asap.
cool, another disappointment in the works. I can't wait for them to focus on flashy bullshit like graphics instead of a coherent story and satisfying gameplay integrated with said story. I can't wait to be able to close my eyes and mash x and beat the entire game 😎 with all due respect, I don't trust you to make anything after what you presented us with over a decade of development for KH3. I don't care how it looks. kingdom hearts was never about graphics. make the game good. whatever time it takes just take it. for fucks sake redeem yourselves and maybe I'll buy this game. otherwise it will remain a forcibly forgotten memory in the depths of my closet like the rest. your fans deserve so much better than what you have given them, your characters deserve the same respect.
Now that Sora is in the real world I like how the art style changed to the Final Fantasy type. Now we'll wait 7 years for 4. This is so cool, it's like a new Chapter to KH and it took a darker route
Nomura is getting his Final Fantasy Versus 13. He just had to take a long and convoluted road to get there.
Sora is a full final fsntsy character now!!
“Your minds made up ?” Is such an iconic line in the series.
And just like post kh1 there is another mobile game you will need to play to get the whole story. Hope it doesn’t use cards again. But hey we got 4 now, maybe I won’t die before seeing the end woo!
Yooo can't wait for kh4!!  It's gonna be awesome.
I was like if this is a late April fools- but im extremely happy for whenever this drops!+
Not sure about anyone else... This is just my take.  While the Dark Road material was a nice thing to see, the rest of the trailer in my personal opinion was VERY underwhelming.  The mobile game Missing Link, other than the potential of new characters being introduced, looked really poor.  The KH4 Trailer was in my opinion rushed and contained almost nothing in terms of things to be excited about from a hardcore fan perspective.  It's just some gameplay with Sora waking up (yet again) to Darkside and some danger.  We will see what other info comes out but as of right now I'm not as stoked as I thought I'd be.
am die thank you foreva ❤❤❤❤😭
I don't care what anybody says Kingdom hearts 3 was simply amazing and was definitely game of the year for me,  so I'm extremely excited for Kingdom hearts 4 because this looks like a proper evolution of everything I wanted!!
Is that hades at the end?
LETS FUCKIN GOOO
I'm gunna come
Holy shit, this looks a lot like FFXV animation, which was amazing. Please let us get a more Final Fantasy-oriented KH this time, PLEASE, and maybe instead of a bunch of Disney/Pixar worlds, we get some anime worlds like Eureka Seven and Attack on Titan. I'd preorder that shit even though I was slightly disappointed with KH3
I was expecting a Rick Roll with this trailer, but now that I know that this is for real, I haven’t been given another reason to cry tears of joy till now. Take my money NOW, Nomura-San!
Just woke up to this lol holy S**T I’m so energized 😂 who else?
What about having the game on PC? And with that I mean Steam. Epic Store doesn't count since it sucks.
Now way the actual game will look this good
Please fix Sora his face. Hate how he looks in this trailer. Also the world is a bit off with realistic looking buildings and low quality looking people. Also there is a graphics downgrade when the fight starts. + add cool worlds like: Ducktales, The Mummy, Star Wars, Jungle Book, Finding Nemo. With Unreal Engine 5 it is possible to make look great.
Loved that I was completely surprised by this reveal. I thought this was just going to be an anniversary trailer with footage from the entire series. This was more than I could have ever asked for.
Can't wait for that 2025 release date
Hell yeah. My childhood game is still full of life and it makes me bally to see. I hope this games comes out  In the near future because waiting for KH3 took so much out of me. But I know in the end it will all be worth it.
iamsi011010100111010010101010
ok but guys I was not expecting to see Sora’s feet today
So KH4 takes place in the real world now? There's so much potential with this!
HOLY CRAP KH4 looks even better than I could’ve imagined!!!
I never knew I needed Japanese goofy in my life until now
Controversial take tho: As beautiful this teaser is and how much I love Kingdom Hearts, I think Kingdom Hearts as a franchise needs to rest already. But I guess Nomura still hasn't gotten over his FF Versus 13 idea which can be clearly seen in this teaser alone. But yeah either way, it looks amazing.
I wonder if the Kingdom Hearts series will still use Mickey Mouse a.k.a. King Mickey in their newest Kingdom Hearts game later in the future legal wise? I mean… does Tetsuya Nomura and Square Enix know that Mickey Mouse might almost enter the Public Domain someday on January 1st 2024, in case the Disney Company that helped co create the Kingdom Hearts Disney Crossover video game franchise with Square Enix and Tetsuya Nomura 20 years ago has not yet renewed their (shall we say) ownership rights to Walt Disney’s co creation that Walt Disney made with Ub Iwerks about almost a century ago now🧐?   Like what will happen if there’s no King Mickey in KH4 if KH4 comes out around that very year the Mickey Mouse character enters the public domain in the beginning of 2024 after that? Because that’s what I’m starting to worry about, because for once in my life, I hope the Disney Company remembers to renew their ownership rights to Mickey Mouse so that Disney and Square Enix can still use him in the Kingdom Hearts franchise that’s co owned by those two companies later on🙏.  Wait… should we hope that Disney renews their ownership rights to Mickey Mouse just so that he can still be used in Kingdom Hearts 4 as King Mickey later on🫤, or will King Mickey still be fine in KH4 even if the main Ol’ Mickey himself will inevitably enter the Public Domain on January 1st 2024 someday eventually?  Will we still see Mickey Mouse in KH4 as King Mickey whether or not he’ll enter the Public Domain on January 1st 2024, ahhh my brain hurts🧠😵‍💫.
Kingdom hearts for life!
>kh4 >quadratum See what you did there Nomura.
MIND BLOWN! Well done Tetsuya Nomura.
Sora and Strelitzia are alive !
“You get a grappling hook! And you get a grappling hook! Every game series gets a grappling hook!”  Thank you, Bionic Commando.
Nomura will have his Versus XIII, whether Square likes it or not.
Hyped for KH4 but that setting looks so bland and boring, better not look like that on release
1:24 roxas & axel reference
KH4 looking more like a ff game... love it. Cant wait for Riku entrance
Square enix has too many upcoming games 😱
Y'all think we'll be able to explore Quadratum?
4:42 AT-ST foot in upper right corner
Hell yeah baby, kingdom hearts 4. Can't wait to play it in 10 years
hades is back!
FeelsStrongMan
Cannot wait! What a wonderful morning!
Aw shit, here we go again...
I like Sora’s new design, but I’m gonna miss the old cartoon look he had in the previous games. I can’t wait to see what this new game has in store!
I WAS SO SCARED I WOULD NEVER SEE SORA AGAIN!!!!! 😭😍😍😍 I’m so happy!!!!!
1:56 I really love the Dearly Beloved :3
that voice, is levi from AOT
LET'S GOOO!!!!  I'M SO EXCITED AAAAAAAAAA
I did not expect to be woken up to Kingdom Hearts 4. I’m not even halfway done with Dream Drop Distance yet!
Thank god I didn't kill myself last week
STRELITZIAAAAAA
Where's Hikaru Utada's New Master piece!!!??
YOOOOO WHAT THE FUCK 😮
Darkside heartless look like Dormin (SOTC)
Wow I’m crying 😭 I can’t believe they’re coming out with KH4!!!
Kingdom Heart 4 with Unreal Engine 5 is INSANE 🔥
Man. . Fuck yall. I loved KH when I was 12 years old. I am about to be 30. Yall took literally an entire childhood and adulthood to come back out.
I hope so much they will use different languages for the synchro. 3 in english was not really cool and feels wrong, after the perfect german voices in 1 and 2😅
at a buffet, i personally sneak corndogs into the buffet so others can enjoy them. I hide 6 corndogs in my jacket pockets. it then, is a joy for me to see other patrons of the establishment eat my corndogs thinking they were part of the bufffffff
A FRIGGIN DRILL!! A GURREN LAGANN REFERENCE!!!
7:20 .. What? Hades? Is that you?
Best morning I’ve woken up to 😭
OH GOSH FINAL FANTASY LOOKS GREAT
I don't play these games, but damn this looks beautiful
I'm so geeked! I can't wait! I wasn't expecting this at all!
Yeah boiiiii
Can't wait to play this in probably 20 years!
Let's goooo!!!!
Hell yeah! 2 phone games I'll never play and VS13 again! Thanks Nomura!
*ALERT ALERT, THIS IS JUST AN OPINION, IT IS NEITHER RIGHT OR WRONG, BUT MY OPINION. TRAVERSE WITH CAUTION*  I can handle Star Wars being in KH, but man, if they put Marvel worlds in the game, or any superhero type shit, I'll be disappointed. Haven't been a fan of superhero movies since I was little, and honestly, I think current ones are super outlandish and too unorthodox for something like Kingdom Hearts. It just doesn't fit for KH in my eyes. The presentation part of the KH4 logo at the end of the trailer sure did sound like it was becoming some sort of a superhero/Marvel title with that score being played. I really hope it doesn't actually come to that.
OMFGGGG!!!!!
This is just like a fever dream, can't believe it man
So how many years? Ive been this series since day one in 2003. Now im 31. Lets see, will i play it, or will my children?
Why does this game look exactly like Sonic 06?!!
KH4 HYPE IS REAL
MY DRILL IS THE DRILL THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVEN! GURREN LAGANN!  Wait wrong movie...
THAT IS ENDOR HOLY SHIT YOU CAN SEE THE AT-ST
The long awaited installment is also here, following up KH4  Square Enix really knows how to hype up things and keeps on make us crying
4:42 Was that an AT-ST leg? Saw someone mention it in another vid.
I cried tears of joy waking up to this! Amazing! Such beautifully done graphics, can't wait to see the final product. I do hope we get selfies as an option again I quite enjoyed that taking fun photos. Please let this be released on all gaming platforms. I would love another cloud release for the switch since I don't have any other game system. Been playing them all via cloud and they have been great!
"if you dont like this ending, then leave, you have endless options"  Nomura speakin directly to the player on that one lmaoooo
If Kingdom Hearts IV exists in modern Japan, then Dearly Beloved must have a JPop mix to it.🥳
One word: *Beautiful*
j'attend le nouveau Kingdom Hearts avec une impatiente de fous
WHAT IS HAPPENING!!!!! I'M SO CRAZY EXCITED!!!
is the game in the middle also getting a console port?
Yeaaah KH4 in the making!!!!!! Im so glad my grandson Will be able to play This game as soon as it lunches . ( My Son is 7 btw )
hell yea! this game looks epic
OMFG
LETS OMEGA FUCKING GOOOO!!!!!!!!!
We all gotta start saving up for a ps7 so we can play it in 20 years
I'm so happy! We will have KH4! ❤🥺
Here we go
I hope they don’t drop the ball on this game like they did with KH3
Omg.... ITS TIME FOR ME TO DO THE KH LEGACY BONUS EPISODES!  New saga has been confirmed
I love seeing how excited people get for this series. Like, I know some people don’t get it, and maybe they never will, but for us who grew up with this franchise, there are few things that stir up the same level of passion that Kingdom Hearts manages to. I’m glad to see that has never faltered. I can not wait for KH4
Sora Is Back From Smash
nao se empolguem tanto, lembrei que kh3 foi anunciado em 2013 e saiu em 2018...
After the trash that was kh3 can’t say I care about 4
Did sora die in KH3?
I see sora still wears a size 30….. Excited for Kh4 tho
OMG THEY FINALLY                   Gave home shoes that fit his feet
KH4???? AM I DREAMING??
He looks like Sora Bieber tbh 😅
This got me trembling this morning. One of the best announcements for KH. The finale of dark road, and another mobile game, and oh baby.. KH4 is here. So soon, so unexpected, but absolutely can't wait.
Woah! This was a pleasant surprise!
Wait, did they just casually throw in a Gurren Lagan reference in that fight?
I thought there isn't anything new this 20th anniversary, soit was such a surprise!! also, goodbye mcdonald shoes sora
Are we not gonna talk about the Dearly Beloved arrangement for KH Missing Link?? It sounds amazing!
Hopefully KH4 doesn’t come out with a really trash story like KH3
Oh great, Kingdom Hearts Versus XIII
KH3 sucked, its cool they are continuing the story but I was just not hooked with the last installment, hopefully they get it right like KH1 and Kh2 when it comes to the story
Meh, that's about it. Looked like nothing but a bunch of QTEs. I'll reserve judgement but after the massive disappointment of 3 my hopes are very low.
I'm happy for those of yall are excited, but I don't get how you can be after kh3. It wasn't atrocious but I don't really hold out hope for 4 after 3s story and how simplistic the form changes were or how the theme park rides were basically all the same thing.
I was about to fucking scream if they only anounced a shitty phone game but they saved it with kh4 gameplay. Sigh now we just have to wait ten more years for that to come out. On a different note Idk how I feel about Sora's design I thing he merged with yozora Which is a fucked up plot point in itself. I just hope it's good I don't want kh4 to be another batman or spiderman I want it to be Kingdom Hearts and the fact that sora changed so much worries me already.
Please don't make the dialogure cringey in this one like the previous titles. Seriously the dialogue and voice acting for KH3 seems like it was written for an audience of 12 year old with long pauses and awkward attempts at comedy.
Kingdom Hearts 4... See you guys in another 13 years...
Cant wait to play this in 2038 im so hyped guys
WOWIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that´s definitly not getting a switch port natively!
When I saw that title I went nuts!
we have disney final fantasy versus at home u mean  Kh4 In Quadratum  Square :of course my child Sora is now an adult
ambasing 😫
Um... Missing Link is supposed to be for Switch right?  Oh COME ON!!!! No one plays the phone shit, we just wait till things like X Back Cover to happen.
It’s happening, folks! Kingdom Hearts IV!
so we have a gachalife kh adventure, a mobile only 3d game that will most likely kill any and all battery functionality, and a game where the cartoonish look of the past installments is thrown away (aside from Donald & Goofy).  I know everyone and their grandmother is excited for another installment to Kingdom Hearts, but if this is what they're bringing to the table, they clearly didn't work hard enough.  The Disney cartoonish style was what made the first 3 games so endearing (no I'm not lumping KH3 into that mess.  I'm going story canon, so KH 1, CoM (not RE:CoM), and KH 2).  KH 3 started to deal away with the cartoonish style in favor of more cartoonish attacks, like they did in 3D.  This, along with the story falling apart, made me *LOSE* my faith in the KH Franchise after KH2.  The only one that's sort of kept the same aesthetic and storytelling was BBS and that is considered Prequel to KH1 as it's what gives Sora & Riku the ability to summon their own Keyblades.  I know from personal history that graphics do not a game make.  It's 2022 and people in their younger ages (25 and below) still enjoy Pac-Man, Pong, Galaga, and other classic titles from the 1980s and before.  Heck, even Mario Maker has the original NES style that people still love and adore to this day, and it's been almost 30 years since release (1985).  It can make a game look more pleasing to the eye, but when your previous installments heavily lent on a cartoonish style, and you're going to transfer to more realistic graphics, you should do it gradually, or make an entirely new series altogether.  Sony, if you listen to YT comments, my hope for your future installments is that you realize that graphics do not a game make, and go back to that Disney cartoonish style from the first three games (again, not lumping KH3 into that).  You can futz around with the story all you like, since we're already dealing with time travel thanks to the ending of KH3...  But messing around with graphics just because it makes it look better immediately detracts me from purchasing it.  Matter of fact, I'd rather play KH1, CoM, and KH2 again than any other installment into the franchise at this point, including the 3 mentioned in this video.  Now, I'm not saying that what they're doing is bad by any stretch.  TO ME it's a bad idea, but I'm just a normal consumer and not one of the developers or someone in the corporate ladder.  What I am, though, is an investment.  They are investing time, money, and effort, into making something that the populace will purchase and enjoy.  If the populace does not buy, then they attempt to fix what they did wrong.  What I'm trying to do is to have them dedicate more time to things that actually matter to the series canon, instead of just making it slightly more aesthetically pleasing to look at.
Can't believe it aldy 20 year.. Congratulations to all the people that stick to this game since it 1st release
Actual gameplay looks trash tho
Voice fr KH4 please
Why does 4:41 looks like the river from encanto
I SAW THIS ON INSTAGRAM THIS MORNING- I legit lost my shit with over the top fangirling because this is my first time waiting for a KH game and I’m SO FREAKING EXCITED. I mean look at this! This game looks gorgeous!
Fcku you Nomura i ain't waiting another 15 years for you to release KH4 next time you announce a game do it a week before it's finished  Y'all can mark my words this shit will be out for the PS9 in 2035
my god. and i haven't even finished re:mind
I'm so happy, I could combust into flames right about now!!   All I would like to see is maybe a KH Fighting Game, but that's just wishful thinking haha.
_Giant darkness monster attacks middle of city_ Sora: _Aw heck, here we go again._
Finally Kingdom Hearts is really starting to play around with its meta-aspects. I hope Smash-shenaningas make at least a little easter egg appearance in the story.
Was not emotionally prepared for so much. I love this world you’ve all created. Thanks for keeping magic alive for all of us 🙏
YyyyeeesaaaaAAASSSS!!!!   YEEES!!! YEEEAAAAS!!! We got more KH games and KH4!!~
First off, I'd like to mention that I am one of the biggest fans of the Kingdom Hearts series on the planet.   Next, I'd like to say that killing Sora broke my fuggin' heart, man. I was not happy with the ending. It was very, very sad.  And now, of all things, you think to CONTINUE his story, from the afterlife? I am offended.  This hurts me. First you kill off the best character in the series, and then you reboot him for another cash grab of a game. Will I be buying this game? Yes.  Not because I want to support you dragging one of my favorite characters through the mud just to get a few more million dollars.  But because I love the story and need to know what happens.  But still, not cool.
Don’t let this be like 3 with barely any worlds and content and you have your self a deal
yo, noctis with brown hair? nomura's addiction to the noctis hairdo is getting out of hand. riku and yozora was enough but this is just getting wack. i hope this is just world specific.
whoa sweet, KH4. Can't wait for the game to come out in 12 years
What? No Yozora?
See ya in 10 years

7:18 - Hades?
🚮🚮🚮🚮 Our Childhood meant NOTHING TO THESE PEOPLE……I’m DONE KH3 WAS COMPLETELY 💩🚽 …..We waited 10+ Yrs then the DLC was also 💩….Now this crap where the heck is Sora, Donald, and Goofy??? Why is Kairi a key blade master who can’t defend herself after training? How come Ventus and Roxas never had that weird “Dude you stole my damn face conversation”…Who was driving the car at the end of the game 🖕🏾🖕🏾
I dunno what to make of this. 😕 I feel like they've exhausted certain story arcs & concepts. They should just move onto something else or go back to the first game's logic and keep it simple. They try too hard to explain everything when it's ok to leave things mysterious because of the classic Disney-magic system they use. We don't need to know in-depth details of how Pinnochio became a real boy or the nuances of the fairy godmother's power, or why mermaids exist. We can get by with simple surface-level information like what the first game offered. What we're here for is not to hear about the magic but to experience it.   I wanna go to cool worlds and see & do cool things. But the story is so lost and overly complicated now that I just feel tired whenever I see a cutscene -- which is so sad since they used to leave such a cool and powerful impact in the first game (and even in kh:com & kh2).  I think KH3 revealed to everyone undeniably that the writer(s) have written the story into a corner. And how many times is Sora gonna fall asleep or have his memories compromised? It'd be cool if perhaps Sora is supposed to be their interpretation of the fairy tale: Rip Van Winkle. ✨ But I don't have enough confidence in them to expect that. So it just seems like they're reusing the same ideas they used for the most popular games in the kingdom hearts series -- either to trigger nostalgia or make desperate attempts at recapturing the "magic" the series seems to have lost.  Overexplaining and making things too complicated for the majority of the audience is what took the magic away. If they can accept that, then maybe they can come up with some semblance of a solution that can save the series and put it back on track.
So much to look forward too. It’s a great time to b a KH fan. 💯 👑❤️
Sora: dies  Donald & Goofy: let's go talk to the dickhead God of the world (at least my guess is it's Hades with the blue flame going to hot red)
KH4 is happening! Can't wait to for it! My friends are my power!
Yozora is a future version of Sora from Quadratum
I havent even playd 3 yet because Ibam waiting for a steam release.
Awww yeeaaa now only 6 years left
I don't want Donald and Goofy to come back, damn it lol
6:11 IT LOOKS LIKE METAL GEAR RISING!!!! THIS IS EPIC!!!! I'M SO HYPED!!!!! I CANT WAIT!!!!         (anyone who's going to reply "dont get your hopes up" guess what! I liked kh3!!! and also, my notifications are turned off so you can't say a single word to break my spirit!!!)
trailer spoiler warning of me screaming!              AAAAAHHHHH SORA LOOKIN LIKE NOCTIS!!!!! AAAAAAHHHHH MARLUXIA'S SIS IS ALIVE!!!!!!
FUCK YEEEEEEAH!!!
Do you think they told Nomura about KH4 before announcing it or is this the first time he's hearing about it too?
Who would have known that a lil ol game we all picked up as children 20 years ago, would have created this massive culture of love and passion? I still remember rushing home immediately after school to play. I was 9 years old man. wild.
Who plays these mobile games? This looks better than the rest but I'd rather just actual games... Man...
Now is not only a Disney x Final Fantasy crossover, now we have sans  P.S: Grettings person from 10 years ahead seeing this trailer when the game finally releases
One the best news to wake up to this morning 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 my childhood game gets a part 4  beyond excited 🙏🏽🙏🏽
Thought he died? But I bet nobody cares.
Now let's pray to all the deities in existence that the story and combat aren't literal garbage like KHIII. Been playing the series for 20 years and am really hoping for a return to form.
NOMURAS REVENGEANCE
Great to see Kingdom Hearts 4 announced! Hopefully we can get our hands on it quicker since it wasn't revealed long after KH3, three years after release. After KH2 it took about 7 years until 3 was announced in 2013.
So.. next trailer in 8 years?
Ahhh... see you all again in 20 years
発売日が決まってから発表をするべき
I grew up playing this game and watching it grow as I do is just magical ✨✨
Meh... not excited at all...  If this fourth game does not fix the stupid, convulsed and full of missing opportunities narratives of all the games, specially the third game, im gonna save my money. KH3 was the last hope i was having for the franchise to fix it.   I'm not hyped at all with the anouncement.
Our core for more Kingdom Hearts in our lives has been answered.
LET’S GOOOOO! I miss making KHUx content, this is super exciting!
Them graphics!!!
2 GAMES
Remember guys, six years when three was announced.
Honestly I was dissatisfied with kh3 so I have no hope for kh4
Kingdom hearts 4 confrim3d. I have to keep living now. Bet. Let's go
I am glad Sora and Strelitzia are sane decent humans who don't wear shoes indoors
Now all that’s left is to wait till 2057 for it to come out
GET ALL THIS ANIME NONSENSE OFF MY SCREEN, MY BOYS GOOFY AND DONALD ARE *COMING HOME!!*
Honestly, I’m totally speechless and REALLY EXCITED for it.
Maybe this one will be written well. Regardless, what a surprise.
Don’t fall for the hype, 10+years for 3 to be a let down. Just for them to just come and slap us in the face with … two Mobile phone games and a kingdom hearts 4 they may take another 7 years.  No Hype and keep your nfts!!
I really hope this game fills out the lore of Kingdom Hearts more. Its always just felt like lore in this series has been sparse.
Oh woah!  KH4 looks so good! So happy to see Sora again! Happy 20th Anniversary Kingdom Hearts!
KH3 was announced in 2013. I really hope we don't have to wait 6 years for the game this time.
I really hope this isn't like KH3, in the sense that it was announced way too early and was hyped way too much.
Yes just fucken yes I loved all the kingdom hearts up till the 3red where it was abit more childish but still enjoyable.... but this.... this is going to be something good I bet and u better believe I'm going to play when it comes out and I buy it
Let's just hope this doesn't turn out a failure like KH3...
Trying to be hyped but man KH3 left me with such a bad taste in my mouth. I'll just have to wait and see how this turns out and keep my expectations in check.  Also the part of me that's a cultured man is totally ready to see what becomes of that Dimitriscu Heartless in the cultured realms online.
This almost made me cry ❤
Is this real and not an April fools joke?!
no please we don’t need to give kh the ff7r treatment
Awesome!!!
THIS MEANS WE WILL GET ANOTHER TRAILER WITHIN 5 YEARS LETS GOOOO
Is it me or does kh4 looks like it’s using UE5? If so it looks really nice
Is nobody gonna talk about Sora's non oversized shoes?
IS THAT MY BABY STRELITZIA???
OH MY GOD DUUUUUUUUUDDDDDDDDEEEEEE I STILLLLLLL CAN"T BELIEVE THUS I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT THOSE REAL GRAPHIS SORRRRRRAAAAA AND YOUR GIRL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! KINGDOM HEARTS 4!!!!!!!!!!
Bruh, all this stuff being announced especially KH4 got me all hyped up for the game, plus I love how the game looks realistic, smooth, and clean like Square Enix using a new engine.
4:42 is the foot of an AT-ST. WE'RE GETTING STAR WARS EVERYONE!
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS DONE WITH THEM, THEY *PULL ME BACK IN.* KH4 LOOKS FUCKING AMAZING. 😭😭😭😭
>zero mention of Wood They arent even keeping to the established Canon
And it didn't even take 8 to 9 years I'm so proud ❤️
SNORE,SNORE,SNORE
I think Normura should make a clothing line I’d buy it
It is such a gift sent in the morning surprisingly. I look forward to seeing my childhood friend Sora growing up exploring the new world in a new style. I can't wait 💜
GIVE ME A DATE, SHUT UP, AND TAKE MY MONEY
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MORNINGS OF MY LIFE
Korean Donald is so poggers
after KH3 my friend... really worried..
The biggest surprise is that we actually see Sora's feet.  That is a small detail, bu that i something that you only notice once you become aware of things... kinda similar to the idea that Sora ctually has a mother.
KH4.This is really impressive tech there. Looking forward to it
bruh im crying im so happy
TIME TF OUT
Please do not take more than 10 years to do this new game and also include worlds based on Final Fantasy in this new game.
Yeahhhhhhhhh! Baby! Finally!!!
Yeahhhhhhhhh! Baby! Finally!!!
Ummm. Is this still a Disney thing?
Ive been having a lot weird dreams lately..... but nothing like this. KH4 within a few years can't wait!
Announced during the 20th anniversary, probably released on the 25th. Can't wait!
I cant believe it we only had 1 side game since 3 and DLC for it I am impressed this is much better then what happened between 3 and literally everything else
I just want reaction commands back pls
All I wanted.... was them to not pull the same shenanigans they did before KH3... with the millions of games in between 2 and 3... THANK YOU FOR LISTENING!!!
So is it Sora or Yozoro?
Holly cow the art is so beautiful 🤩
Over time Sora’s gotten taller, but his feet have gotten smaller 👀👀
I've yet to play KH3 so I don't really know how the events of this new KH4 come into being but it just looks . . . weird. It doesn't feel like Kingdom Hearts it just feels too . . . real world (I suppose that's the point).
Wow kingdom hearts 4
The scene where Sora is running to the heartless gives the feeling of solitude. He's the only one running towards it, because he's the only one who can deal with it.
Please make it lut for ps4 🙏🙏
KH4 🤔
Wow the animation is absolutely stunning!! I don't know much about Kingdom Hearts but I'm already loving with the direction they chose this time for the next installment 👏🏻
Oh my god hades killed goofy
Everyone else: *Excitement* Me: OH MY GOD!!!! SORA HAS NORMAL SHOOOOOES!!!!
Pelo visto não vamos esperar vários anos dessa vez haha. Tecnicamente falando, o motor gráfico já é bonito... Então não há necessidade de tanto tempo e até mesmo licenças para ser aguardar.
De acuerdo... El primer tráiler ya me tenía atento... Pero con el segundo... Se robaron toda mi atención, está increíble :D  Edit: Me preguntó que tipo de juego será missing link... Uno de esos juegos pequeños pero divertidos entre número y número... Un gatcha? Solo estoy feliz de que salga para moviles  What? Sora en ultra HD además de tener el pelo de yozors... What?  Kh4!!! Tan rápido? Wow, esto es demasiado, iré a desmayarme un rato :'D
Sora looks so similar with Hope, kawaii
Omg u have me crying over here SORA MY B0Y UR OKAY omg
Strelitzia: Hey, you. You're finally awake.
Keep these graphic because they’re better graphics than kh3 and is that Strelitzia 😭
When I tell you I’m literally about to jump out my skin
I expected a 3.8, so I'm really hype rn
Disney? The LGBTQ representation will be insane!
MY HEART IS ON FIRE! LETS GOOOOO!
WHY IS KEY LORE STUCK IN MOBILE GAMES, SQUARE FREE ME
Let’s just wait a couple ten years and we’ll get kh4
But before we get that we obviously have to get Kingdom Hearts 1.75 and Kingdom Hearts 2.986 Quadruple extreme completion mix. And of course everybody's favorite Kingdom Hearts 3.56/7  2nd power x82 and a 1/2 days final proud critical completion mix the Snyder cut.
4:42 AT foot. Endor world confirmed!
4:42 is that the feet of an AT ST from starwars? Top right corner
Any speculation on who that was at the end?
Where they looking for Auron?
Im fucking crying what a wonderful pre birthday announcement mine is tomorrow
Idk about this one, since kingdom hearts 3 was a let down, despite of how good it looks. Just like Sonic Frontier and Pokemon Scarlett and Violet, I'll wait till I see it being a good game.
20 years of this nonsensical weeb bullshit
At 4:42 top right corner, that's the foot of an AT-ST from STAR WARS!!!!!! Change my mind
Cool can't wait for the new games and KH4 but please don't make it more into Final Fantasy and keep it KH. Hurry up and bring out KH on Steam.
I don't care what yall say. I liked KH3, minus the attractions feature. I'm looking forward to KH4.  The only thing I ask is that we get a good mix of FF and Disney.
WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!!!
Mobile game
Man... I could never bring myself to finish KH3 is was so boeing... But still a Very nice visual direction to watch on youtube
WHERE IS JUST A PANCAKE
Non-Disney World I hope to be included: Coraline Worlds I hope to be included: Brave, Moana, Turning Red, Robin Hood, Inside Out, Encanto, Atlantis, Treasure Island, Lilo and Stitch (Hawaii) Worlds I hope make a cameo/summon: Oliver and Company  Any more worlds? Yes!
Sora is Spider Man Now!?
Bro a KH4?!?! TOTALLY  NOT expected when I woke up today!!!!!!!!!!
Hopefully we get more Original/Final Fantasy worlds rather than Disney worlds 🙌
So anyone can just get a keyblade now eh and sora looks so different now
I guess the leaks were right lmao
So... The Nvidia leaks were telling the truth after all. I'm shocked.
Ohhh wow omg lmaooo dude wtf 😫 this is tooo much 👍🤟👊
OMG the grafics looks so GOOD!
but... KH on Steam please     👉👈
Man this better be good.
I miss cartoony sora he looks yo real Nomura has a habit of always putting characters in fucking Tokyo
-May your hearts be your guiding key (Sora, Kingdom Hearts)
HOLY MF SHIT I NEED TO CATCH UP... THIS LOOKS AMAZING
HOLY SHIT!!!
Hades, eh? I'm definitely interested.
Ok I believe you
KINGDOM HEARTS HEARTS FANS EATIN GOOOOOOOOD!!!
Other than KH4 which so far looks okay. And do mean just okay.. But everything before it makes Kingdom Hearts feel not speacial anymore. To many things being incorporated that no one really asked for and doesn't do what Kingdom Hearts use to be any justice.
Whe you realize that Sora has normal sized feet
Will we be able to play? Or are we going to press only one button to hit automatically?
Why does this shit make me cry
Can’t wait for the game to come out in 15 years!!!
Also, Master of Masters is Deadpool 🎉
I'm not crying, y'all are crying
maaaaan i was hoping they'd leave the disney worlds behind considering how HEAVILY they're building their own world and stuff.  ALSO WE DONT NEED MORE HOODS  WE DON'T HAVE A LOST OF SUSPECTS, SO HIDING IDENTITIES DOESN'T DO ANYTHING!
I’m in shock I can’t believe we are getting 4 so close to 3 I thought I’d be in my 40s before it would be announced!?!
Oh dear and I just put these boxers on today.
Out of all the worlds to get Isekaied to…
First time seeing Sora's bare feet!? And wearing NOT CLOWN SHOES!?
AW HELL YEAH NOW THAT WAS AWESOME
They really looked at the graphics for the new final fantasy games and said ‘mmmm lemme try’ JDJS   I can’t say I’m not excited
SAITAMA!
Kh4 confirmation makes my birthday awesome! 😎👍
And will I get all my medals back in Union cross because I was top 30 and I spent hella money
IM CRYING 😭♥️ ALL I'M LEFT IS TEARS. IM SO GRATEFUL TO YOUU
HYPED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hope that kingdom hearts 4 has the gameplay of 1 &2, the longevity of 2, The Music of 1&2 and the animation of 3 because the 3rd one sucked so bad. The story sucked so badly and made no sense. But fingers crossed you know? Just gotta hope someone will listen. Judging by this trailer looks more Final Fantasy then Disney now.
I’m so freaking hyped
I just woke up to a series of texts.... Damn. I wasn't expecting this😱😭😱😭😱😭
Man I woke up to seeing this trailer and it indeed made me wide awake!! I scream so loud seeing KH4 🤣🤣
SPIDERMAN will be in this game watch
So 2 app games with a release date, 1 actual game with no release date, and we see the two most annoying side kicks in history at the end, neat
HOLY MOLY
When I see KH4 word I though I still dreaming, damn what a time to be alive
7:00 - "Fight side by side with Dolan and Goobie"
Now we have to wait til PlayStation 7 to play this
I played KH when I was in 2 class 😂  Doing my PG right now . Time surely flies
OH MY GOOD, JESUS CHRIST , ITS FINALLY COMING. THE ERA THAT WE GREW UP WITH! ITS COMING BACK, Its Beautiful.
Okay but like, am I the only one who doesn't like the new look? KH has always been more cartoony and it blended well with the disney worlds. KH3 art style was a perfect balance of good looking human characters and the cartoon nature of disney imo. :/
Well then...... That's one way to celebrate kh 20th anniversary  Announcing kh4......noice 😌👌🏽
Oh man the key chain is a grappling hook 😮
STAR WARS????
Awesome, but sadly hades was at the end which means that they’re gonna keep pushing disney, at first it looked like they finally were gonna embrace full on Final Fantasy. Still grateful for a new Kingdom Hearts nuntheless, blessings 🙏
Coming out in 2030 lmao...   Very excited for this, but seriously, lets not do another stupid ass 7 to 8 year wait after being announced.
Omg I’m freaking dying over here and I’ve waited a year for this
Ummm still waiting for steam release
Everythings looks so damn, cinematically beautiful here for Kingdom Hearts IV here. I seriously can't wait to see the finished game myself in the future here!
Now just to wait till 2050 and maybe the game will come out...
For a moment i thought we were getting a multiplayer KH with character creation on console. But instead we’re getting a mobile game (meh) and KH4. I’m perfectly fine with KH4 instead
Holy crap! Y'all we back on the hype train and it's more crazier than it was before! I love you guys! Let's gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!  Also Strelizia though?!??!?
So, how long do you guys think it will take kingdom hearts 4 to come out?
If this game comes out in 2024, Justapancake would have predicted this.
🤯Yeah I get it I get it. But this better not distract from FF7 remake part 2
Ok but can we talk about Missing Link, another multiplayer game it seems but this time it's actual combat! I'm so excited! The amibo looking attack system put me off for a sec but I genuinely can't wait to see how this takes the kingdom hearts series
To launch such a good looking game on mobile... 💀 KHIV looks pretty amazing visually, BUT, i really don't like how Sora and Stratchiayella or whatever is her name look different compared to everyone else. They have photo realistic bodies/skin but anime hair, it just looks so odd.
Kingdom Hearts 4… KH ain’t for kids anymore lol. That giant heartless boss was crushing cars! Murder 100%
This is just amazing. I am literally smiling right now.
gross flow motion
You know... After the wait for KH3, I sometimes thought "Could I really get excited for Kingdom Hearts 4 or would the magic be gone..." HOLY FUCKING SHIT KINGDOM HEARTS 4 WOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
IM SO HAPPY ❤️
What the fuck is that Missing Link shit?!?! And of course it's gonna be important seeing how Brain is there. Fuck Square
SORA LOOKS SO GOOD IN THE FINAL FANTASY ARTWORK!!! I’M FUCKING CRYING INSIDE!!
Can't wait to explore Quahog see the Peter Griffin Summon!
BRO THEY GAVE SORA REGULAR SIZED SHOES 😭😭
Let’s go, kingdom hearts hype
Can't wait to play KH4 when it releases in 2028.
YESSSSSSSS, I'D BEEN DREAMING OF OF A 3D MOBILE GAME AND I NEVER EVEN DARED TO WISH FOR KH4 SO SOON, AND BOTH ARE BEFORE MY EYES THIS DAYYYYYYYYYYYYY
KH4!! LETS FUCKIN GOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
Sora's feet are too small. 0/10
GO SORA!
Yeah let’s get it!! So damn hyped!
Next i hope Square brings a video about FFVII Remake Part 2
KH4. I’ve ALWAYS believed it was real and now LOOK at this! 😮😳
Finally😭
Absolutely epic and I cannot wait! Sora's feet keep getting smaller and smaller with each new game though 😭
I mean the jumping from car to railing animation look clean as hell. Cant wait for this
LOOK AT THESE GRAPHICS! KH GIVES ME FFXVI VIBES WITH THESE GRAPHICS. IM READYYYY 🗝❤️
I wonder if the UG and Neku, Rindo and friends will be apart of this
It went to Disney to full on anime with a little bit of Disney
HHYYPEEE
No Family Guy or Simsons, no buy!
ON A FREAKING SUNDAY??! THE LORDS DAY?
Lol the end is definitely hades
I dunno what to think. Why they made it like ff7r
6:01 Is this a Drakengard True ending reference 🧐?
I LOVE IT IDC KINGDOM HEARTS GETS BETTER AND BETTER ESPECIALLY QUALITY
Again with the full quick time events? let's hope not...
So Donald and Goofy go to Hades in Olympus to see if he can help get Sora back? That looks like Hades’s fire
I hope they explore more of the Square Enix side this time around. Sora looks crazy good
kingdom hearts is overrated
Give us Yuna in this graphic beauty. Bring back the ff10 characters it will bring up sales!
OVERHYPE TRAIN LETS GO!!!
Troll
See you in 5 years
after kingdom hearts 3 let me down I won't spend a single cent on this one... I lost interest...
The Lost Master Arc  Hmm, I wonder who it is.
I get the feeling that the guy with the flames in the end of this trailer that surprised Goofy and Donald is Hades.
I was so tired last night... and I wake up to this!?!? HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN ASLEEP!!!!?
I am SO ready for KH4 even though it's probably years away yet 😭
OMG WE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING KINGDOM HEARTS 4!!!!!!  I CANT COPE! Omg
AHHHHHHHHHHHH
i cant edit to play missing link
The environment looks bland af.. Sora in Sims world?
Best way to wake up im shakeing
At what point does it become weird to get excited. Like people who were around for the first are now in their thirties!!!
Ugh this 2d art is a aaste of time
I can’t find an English one whos at the end?!? I need to know!! If it was English I could hear the voice but..
This was amazing and on my birthday to! Best birthday gift EVER!!!!!
Man, this series has gone to shite starting with Birth by Sleep, I'll stick to playing the first 2. Still can't believe the stupid mobile game is part of the story.
OH MY GOD!!!!!!! THIS IS REALLY COOL!!!! KH4 AYOOOOOO SORA SO COOL MY BOY IS GROWN UP!!! LETS GO I CAN’T WAIT  “TOW GAME MOBILE AND KH4”
HOW Many Times I Woke up And then Just See an announcement For Something that's So Exciting To See , Not that I'm Complaining :)
What is the song for Union x dark road?
WHAT?!? I was just thinking about possibilities IF a fourth one was in the making. Had no idea it would come true😲. Oh man the possibilities now; like literally I want to see Encanto and Wall-E in this, I got goo story arcs to help 😊.
Man. 20 years. My first game was recorded. Forced a friend in highschool to give it to me
No one mentioned ue5? I think that’s huge and oh man she’d some tears
Correct me if im wrong but, is that girl Strelitzia?
I am never good at wake-ups on the weekend, but my brother just sent this to me and I've never been more hyped in my life. THOSE GRAPHICS!!! AAAAAAAA
I’m crying, omg…..
you guys are delusional to think this is going to be good. another clear case of milking a franchise for money, this shit gonna flop. Who wanna bet?
Didn’t expect that to come 😯 Its seems KH became more FF
Cool kh4 is announced I wonder how many years it will take to make this one I'm guessing 30
YESSSSSSSS
Amo con toda mi alma ❤️ porfavor considerar más dificultad y personajes imposibles de derrotar. Los amo y Gracias! 🤍❤️🖤
Sora looking older and FRESH AS FUCK IN THAT CLEAN SUIT
Oh god the missing link music is so good
Please, just....let me hit Darth Vader with a big freaking key.....please Nomura.
Noooo puede ser kh4
How is everyone this excited after KH3 was absolute dogshit?
*Still images:* OMG it's so photorealistic *Game camera moves:* 🤡
Fans: wow a KH4! Hardcore fans: yall ready to play a shitty mobile game for 100hrs to understand it???
AHHHH
Damn Sora looks fine!     Also first look at his feet lmfao
IS THIS IT STILL KINGDOM HEARTS 4!!?? IT LOOKS SOO AMAZING!!
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😟🤯
Well, can't wait to finally play KHIV when I'm 40. I was already out of High School when KHIII finally happened and put me in a glass case of emotion!
What
coming in 2035 lol
Omg what?!!!!! Seriously I was NOT expecting a KH4 announcement today!😄
I have never played
I JUST SHIT MYSRLF IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE
Alright People I'll see y'all in 2032
God, realism doesn't suit KH at all. It looks so drab.
Orange haired girl HAS TO BE STRELITZIA IM BETTING ON IT
Happy birthday everyone
I had a kind overnight shift and was about to go to bed and then I SMSA’s this trailer now I’m sitting down replaying all of the kingdom heart games
Yesssss finally after such a long time❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hmm; is that Hades at the end Donald and Goofy are looking for? A blue flame; and then a red one as they get scared.
I'm sooooo happy!!!!!! And I have so many questions!!!! WHY DID XEHANORT GO TO THE MIRROR? WHY DID XEHANORT TURN EVIL? HOW STRONG IS MASTER ODIN???? WHO ATTACKED DONALD AND GOOFY AND WHY DIDNT THEY FIGHT BACK???? ARE THE GUARDIANS OF LIGHT UNDER ATTACK?? but also MARLUXIA CONFIRMED TO ADVANCE THE STORY CAUSE OF HIS SISTER, LUXORD CONFIRMED TO BE FROM QUADRATUM, NEW MAGIC, QUADRATUM CONFIRMED TO BE REALM OF DEATH  AND MORE WORLDS FROM THAT REALM, LOST MASTERS ARE IN THE REALM OF DEATH AND HAVE THE POWER TO LEAVE WHEN EVER THEY WANT TO, AND SCALA AD CAELUM EXPANDED MAP COMING SOON 💯💯💯💯 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
wait, Kingdom Hearts 4 just got announced?! and this soon?! awesome! 😺😸 and another Mobile game too?!
Crazy
Hoping its better than KH3
Sora using the Mickey chain on his keyblade as a whip is fucking genius
Around 4:41 is that an AT-AT foot? 🤔🤔🤔
Not gonna lie I was legit worried Sora wasn't going to be able to summon the keyblade when he was booking it to the darkside cuz it's qUAdrAtUm
It's really really warming to know that i'll see more Kingdom Hearts stuff and still be growing up with my favorite characters! I love this series so much
Hyped
LET'S FUCKIN GOOOOOOO
Amazing. 😁
If you were to let random A.I. generator write the plot then spread it out between 10 different platforms you get Kingdom Hearts.
Sora with normal-sized shoes. It's just not natural.
Very happy, just hope this isn't another case of announcing too early like they did with Kingdom Hearts III.
Please have the power creep in Missing Link be not as crazy as Union X. Preeetty pleaseeee
Hyped for all of this, I’m just saying that better had not been Hades talking to Donald and Goofy 😂
4:43 is that an AT-RT foot? Star Wars confirmed?
I did NOT just see a trailer for KH4!  That’s impossible! It has NOT been 10 years
Hopefully Quadratum/Shibuya lasts until mid-point after which Donald & Goofy wake Sora up or bring him back to "reality". I would imagine the game will be in linear segments where we jump from each guardian groups in their places. Also Neo Twewy gang for first world please lolol Rindo can mistake Sora for Neku or they can both look for Neku together lolol. Anyway, here's to hoping they haven't turned it into Nier/FF7Remake in terms of colour wise, I like more vibrant colours in KH... Still hyped and anticipating for a release date.. prob in 2024 spring?
So we're getting a KH version of Twisted Wonderland and two parkour simulators?? The level of bizarre fits the franchise perfectly.
I wasn’t ready for this today. First Sora in smash now this? Mind blown!
Kingdom Hearts 4, coming in...........................................................someday
Is it just me or does that forest look like Endor and at 4:41 is that the foot of an AT-ST in the top right corner?...
Even the dev team was like, “the logo needs a modern touch” kinda wish they kept the old one from all the other games!
Omg it’s so intense seeing all this kingdom hearts content. It melts my heart!
*Foaming at the mouth*
This is beautiful, I wish they release it soon, don't wanna wait like 10 years for it.
BE PREPARE FOR STAR WARS AND MARVEL IN THIS NEW GAME BOIS
This gameplay is so clean it brings me back to ffXV trailers, wich is kinda scary to say the least...
My boy got regular shoes on now.. 😢 They grow up so fast.. 😭
I can't believe it!!!!!!!! NOMURAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
So what's Normura's fashion fetish going to be this time? Kingdom Hearts 3 was all about plade.
Potential Spoiler timestamped below!       4:42 Upper right hand corner you can see what looks to be the foot of an ATST, making this world likely Endor, so Star Wars confirmed?
So a shitty mobile game and KH4 twenty years before it releases.
HOLY CRAP KH4 LOOKS SOOOOOO GOOD ITS PROBABLY ONLY GON A BE FOR PS5 THOUGH
My favorite Disney world: Tokyo
Kh4 oh my god I can’t believe it
Can't wait to play this in 2035
Will kingdom hearts 4 be on Nintendo switch?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEK
Geez Sora must have been asleep for like 3 years man's look like an adult
Honestly was not expecting any of this. I thought it was done for good. Pleasantly surprised. This makes my heart so full. Here’s to 20 years and more! 🎉
As always, the music is impeccable
Hopefully they’ve taken notes on what not to do from KH3 lol
I so wanted a kingdom Hearts for mobile 😔
Ok so when is the release..... 2040?.
Yeah I’m not gonna lie, I’m not interested. The plot has become a jumbled amalgamation of 💩. It’s like ru Paul announcing another season of drag race. Yeah there are the ‘tistics that are gonna engage regardless and that’s okay. I’ll save my money and mental space.
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Nothing about Steam? Well, will pass on that too, until it is available. I have waited for Godfall, I have waited for Borderlands 3, I have waited for Maneater... I will wait for this too.
1) Nomura has basically just decided that KH is going to become his replacement for Versus XIII because he just can't let that go. 2) I don't think FF characters are ever really coming back...
HOLY $h!t Was not expecting this, now I DEFINITELY should go back and do that bonus fight in KH3 😅
so sora is in GTA now?
Love waking up to this news!!! Just imagine with these graphics how amazing a fight against sephiroth would be like????????? AND MAYBE ADD STAR WARS??? A fight with darth vader will be a dream come true.
10 yrs from now kh4 will still be in development haha
Yay the convoluted fever dream continues 😂
Oh my god I for sure wasn’t expecting this announcement today of all days!! This new entry looks so sick and the graphics look beautiful! That grappling hook was so dope!!
Well, talk about making sure someone is wide awake! They gave no warning at all about this! They just suddenly slapped us with a KH4 trailer early in the morning and went on their merry way! XD  I feel kinda bad for the other two games though. Not only are they mobile games (which has a huge stigma to them), but they were WAY overshadowed by KH4!  Here’s hoping it’s for precious gen consoles too! PS5s are still incredibly hard to get in my area. Well, outside of scalpers who sell them for over a thousand online.
HOLY SMOKES! I WASNT EXPECTING THIS TILL 2030
Hopefully there will be FF characters this time around so it doesn't end up being a disappointment like the 3rd game.
BROOOOOOOOOOOO IM LOSING MY MIND
I’m literally tearing up right now
i am SCREAMING
Wait, that looks like an AT-ST foot at 4:42.
Holy shit! I can’t stop smiling
I'm thinking for Disney Worlds in Kingdom Hearts IV: Most Likely: Moana, Raya & the Last Dragon, Frozen II Maybe: Toy Story, Pirates of the Caribbean On Strange Tides, Zootopia, Wreck-It Ralph
LETS GOOO THIS A GREAT DAY
Traigan los juegos de móviles al español, porfa mi gente mi raza AAAAAAAA, TENGO EL HYPE EN EL AIRE
Who do you think is it that Donald and goofy meet? It looks like hades again maybe.
I can't wait to play this game and it'll only take 10 more years! 😍🤣
Here's hoping this game doesn't  take 6 to 13 years to come out...
Any idea who Donald and Goofy were looking for?
KH4 will have more worlds based off of the movies that Disney and Pixar released in 2021/2022
Sora looks incredible! I'm so excited for this game, can't wait to see all the new worlds!
As someone who's only played KH in English, hearing Donald and Goofy in Japanese killed me. It was soooo accurate but hilariously different, like they learned Japanese in-between 3 and 4, even though obviously they'd always spoken it in the JPN vers 🤣
F*CK! ALRIGHT GUYS! THEORY TIME!  Who do we think is the guy at the end with Donald and Goofy!?
It looks like Donald and Goofy were looking for Hades to see if Sora ended up in the Underworld.
You dont just walk thru Hades without TALKING to Hades Donald xD
Omfg😭😭😭😭nobody believed me there was a KH4 🥺 The graphics look amazing. But Sora looks different from his cartoony look.
OKAY BUT STRELITZIA ???
About the last scene with Donald and Goofy, and judging by the blue flame, i think it is Hades. Makes sense that don. and g. look for Sora in the underworld, right? I m so glad with the announcements
Can't believe it, they made real life apart of the kingdom hearts lore.
Um ok good morning to you too
Oh no, Sora is growing up! My boi!
Omg omg omg omg omg omg omg I almost lost my mind I woke up to this and sora is an adult yoooooo🫣🫣😓😱😱😱
Sí sabía que volvería
It's happening! It's happening folks!
I say this as a lifelong kh fan… this series is fucking trash this reveal is trash and the games will be trash. Call me a hater but having a complicated plot doesn’t make it good it makes it look like a studio miliing a cash cow and a director who once had a vision throwing away the series. I mean seriously kingdom hearts 1 and 2 were instant classics and are some of the best jrpg action games of all time and now this series is a shell of its former self and offers nothing that any other big budget jrpg already gives you. I like how it even says “if this isnt the ending you wanted go away” like what a slap in the face to people who were dissapointed at how badly kh3 wrapped up the story. Instead of being a long awaited conclusion to a beloved series its a launching point for a new 5/10 jrpg action game with a nothing plot. I didnt mean to be so negative Im just finally done with the series I think. Nothing that I loved or found interesting about the original is in this series anymore:(
KH4 with Unreal 5 *chef kiss!
I'M *SCREAMING!* 🥰🥰😱😱
I wonder...🤔
They gave sora converse
Complimenti Maestro Nomura, sono felice e soddisfatto
donald and goofy almost sound the same in Japanese i love it i can’t wait for kingdom hearts 4
While I’m super excited for KH4, can you please AT LEAST port JUST KH1 natively on Switch?
Strelitzia's back!  AND KHX is coming to 3D?!  I can only handle so much hype Enix!
Sora goes to the real world dude
I’m not crying. You’re crying……
I did not know this was today, and neither all this...especially KH4. Wow, it definitely looks stunning, and for the next-gen, it's gonna be dope. It's crazy it's been a lot of years ever since KH was released and love Sora's design here...shows how much he has grown up.
KH4 and KH M.Link thanks Nomura and Square Enix!!!!! And Sora is cool.
MY BOY IS ALL GROWN UP
Fans: Drop off the series  Kingdom Hearts: Alright, enough of that _(Casts MAGNEGA)_
OH MY GOD
I hope along with this game we will get a Verum Rex game as well where we play as Yozora.
Please give us zootopia world XD
KH4 looks like Final Fantasy Versus XIV. Looks fun to play but I'm hoping it's still got some Disney crossover wackiness.  Which is funny cuz sometimes KH3 felt too Disney... maybe I just want them to hang out with Cloud more.
I can't believe Kingdom Hearts is a 20 year old game...
I’m conflicted. Even though it’s absolutely beautiful, I don’t exactly know how to feel about the realistic graphics. Doesn’t beat that it still looks incredible. I’ll get used to it though
✨⭐✨💞💖💞💖💞💖💞💖💞✨⭐✨
Damn 20 years? this game really growing up with me lol
OMGGGG
is nomura capable of not making each game worse after 2? "oh yeah i play kingdom hearts for the realistic cities and monotone colour schemes"
Guess I might be in the minority here, I seriously hope Final Fantasy characters make a return for 4.  I dropped KH3 within the first hour after hearing there were no FF characters or interactions with them. I mean KH started/is(was?) a Disney and FF crossover game. That's the reason I picked this game up back then.
Normal-sized-feet Sora will take some getting used to
Kingdom Hearts Missing Link, Main Character check, Outfit check, and… new Keyblade? Is it Starlight the Keyblade of the Daybreak Town fellas?
OH MY FUCKING GOD KH4 LOOKS SOOOOO GOOD!!!! My body is ready
Please let the OG KH2 team make this one 🙏🏼
I just want to know what’s in the box
PLEASE tell me we'll get german sub titels for the android/iOS Games 😭
AINT ONOWA YBOYY
All for 1, 1 for All!
WHAT TIMELINE AM I LIVING IN, THERES NO SHOT
So No new disney world's 😔
KH4?@@?@!!?!!?!?!!!!
KH3 ruined any excitement for any future games for me personally. Like I genuinely don’t know how to feel about this, and it just bring up more questions than hype. What’s the point of this new realistic look? And WHY THE HELL are we still dealing with people in the black cloaks???? Like seriously can we move on to a new threat/enemy. I thought the Xehanort saga was over 😓
The reason he's summoning Smash Brothers trophies is because *its* all connected!
See you guys in the year 2026!
Llorooo de la emociooon , un anuncio verdadero de un kingdom hearts IV OMG!!!!!!
First two mobile games announced looked disappointing. Then honestly, for the rest of the video I had no idea that was Sora. Despite seeing his keyblade. Had to read the comments to figure out who that was. All the colors were so muted and the hair was less spikey and the shoes were smaller. Very confusing
Sora has finally become a final fantasy protagonist
no puede ser tan buen aniversario
The gang is back together! Sora, Donald, Goofy and James Woods!
Eh, wasn't a fan of 3.  Had a lot of cool stuff in it, but it feels like the franchise is moving farther from what made it interesting.  This may turn out interesting, but nothing really grabs me here.
I'm 30 and I'm looking forward to play kh4 when I'm 40
IM SO EXCITED BRO. FINALLY MORE TO THE SERIES
lmao why the preview feels like a final fantasy game
eventhough I enjoy the gameplay of KH3, I consider KH3 to be a BIG failure in story and character development, please square enix don't do that again. Hoping the best for KH4!
Gotta admit its real special to see Sora growing up along with the fans who started playing when they were kids. So hyped for this gaaammmee!!! 😭😭😭
kingdom hearts 4?!? I thought we would be waiting for about another 3 years for news or something like that. But let’s hope this game is good!!
what worlds are you guys hopin' for, I'm putting Cars on my wish list
OMG KINGDOM HEARTS 4 IS REALLY HAPPENING! ANOTHER OUT OF THIS WORLD ADVENTURE AWAITS!!!! SO EXCITED OMG!  😍😍😍💖💖🌈🌈🌈
Had to keep checking that it wasn't April fools. I'm excited for Kingdom Hearts 4 and more convoluted Shenanigans ❤👌
Can’t wait for Kingdom Hearts 4: Gurren Lagan edition
I THOUGHT I WAS OUT BUT I WAS FOOLISH TO THINK NOMURA COULDNT PULL ME BACK IN. THIS LOOKS INCREDIBLE LETS GOOOOOOO
I love this … but at this point Square Has far to many flag ship titles that are labeled “in development”  I feel like they are stretched extremely thin and it’s showing in their titles. Literally the only quality title that they have released in the last 4-5 years is ff7 remake everything else wasn’t good , as much as it pains me KH3 was Bad in comparison to previous titles, ff15 was a mess technically, avengers was abysmal. Now they have FF16, FF7R2, For-spoken, and now KH4 in development 3 of which have no release in sight… it looks like they don’t know what they are doing… but I’m a big fan of the company and I hope for the best 🙏🏾
A friend just sended it to me. I would have never expected to see a teaser trailer of f*cking Kingdom Hearts 4 😳
This took me by surprise, I was swearing I would have like 10 games with weird names before a KH4 like it went from 2 to 3.  I'm just sad that I probably won't be able to play, I'm sure this game will be exclusive to the new generation and I intend to keep the PS4 for a while longer since the PS5 around here is still very rare and expensive.
I can't believe it
While the graphics for Missing-Links seems very phone mmoish.  I don't think that's what the final product will look.  They did say it was in closed beta testing, so I imagine the graphics will be updated atleast a little bit by the time it's done.
Dude I just woke up expecting nothing and suddenly this is the first thing I saw on my FB, this is just AMAZING
STRELITZIA!?? OH MY LORD!! <3
Release Date: 2028. No but seriously a new KH trailer just made my day, I'm glad the franchise is still going!"
Great, more trash!!
Time hear more Face My Fears!!
ANYONE KNOW WHO DONALD AND GOFFY WERE TALKING TO? Don’t recognize the Japanese voice acting
Advent Children part 2 looks good
Is that hades?
See you in 30 years, KH4 o/ 🤣
Whoah, can't wait to see the florida anti-lgbt bills world 💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟
Now we wait 10 years for KH4 to come out.
KINGDOM HEARTS 4!!!!!!!
As much views and re-uploads these reveals gets, I’m kind of surprised these so-called “KH fans” don’t ever bother subscribing to the official channel.
OMG IM SO HAPPY THIS IS ANAZIBG OMG
My goodness, KHIV looks unreal (pun intended).  But while the artstyle is drastically different (I assume is because of the world properties of Quadratum.....  oh no, how will Donald and goofy look?) The animations are still true kingdom hearts animations. Looking near identical to kh3.  I'm happy for that, that helps it still feel like a KH game.  Also, when Sora does that grapple with his keyblade, I originally thought it was just a transformation using the Keychain itself, but when Sora grapples onto the car near Darkside's head, you can see the Keychain just hanging there and the grapple chain is just coming out of the same spot as the Keychain.  Seems to be purely a magic ability and not a transformation.
LETS GOOOOOOO QUADRATUM VERSUS 13 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wonder if we are still going to have Disney worlds
0:
SCREAMING!!!!! YESSSSSS! I'M SO EXCITED!!!
i was on toilet 10 minutes ago
wow day 1 buy no brainer😁
I have said for a decade that we have been ready for a KH mainline style combat system on mobile, and we are finally getting it! <3 I AM CRYING
Sora really made it out the hood big time
Kingdom hearts 4 looks basically like the bouncer remixed, Donald and goofy turn out to be mascots at Disney world and Sora was just a lost child in the park, this honestly looks dumb so far.
Either that Hades at the end or Auron
KINGDOM HEARTS 4?! *faints*    Edit: Thank you Nomura :")
Leettttsssssssss freakkkkkkinnnggg gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
7:16 Why did my Undertale mind immediately go “Sans” on a Disney game
At least they showed the mobile games you have to play to understand the story in the same trailer this time
...it begins... again...  is it just me, or does Sora kind of resemble Noctis with that hairstyle...?
Star Wars AT-AT Walker at 4:41 - 4:44
So is KH franchise stepping away from Disney???? Hopefully they do!!!
This i hope.  - Still in PS5 gen ... (Maybe most hardest. :P ). - Don't change Hardware - Software - Model ... etc too much from this use too make KH3. - Hope can feel this update , fix some weakness. Like feeling when play KH2 and think to KH1.
Was that Hades at the very end with Donald and Goofy?
AAAAH KH4 I'M GOING TO CRY I WASN'T EXPECTING THIS TO DROP THIS EARLY  BUT HECK IF I'M READY
HOLY HEAPING DARK SEEKER SAGA! THE NEXT ARC IN KINGDOM HEARTS BEGINS!!!! I am so excited!!! It looks very promising and DARN my boy Sora is growing up more and more!!! 😭
Jesus christ, yall are fucking trained dogs. KH3 was absolute dog shit and you're now hyped for 4? Same fucking people who were excited for Star Wars back in 2015.
Sweet Jesus,finally the real kingdom hearts three!
*SE:* Sorry, Nomura. You won't be allowed to make Versus XIII. *Nomura:* Fine. I'll do it myself. *SE:* What? No, we just told you you WON'T be allowed to— *Nomura:* I'll. Do. It. Myself.
DID NOT EXPECT TO WAKE UP TODAY TO A FACE FULL OF KH4.
Please don't take 7 years. Please don't take 7 years. Please don't take 7 years. Please don't take 7 years. Please don't take 7 years. Please don't take 7 years.
I hate KHIV outfit like i did KHIII.. Bring back the og KH 1 or KHII outfit
I want to hear the mising link dearly beloved full music.  It almost have the same vibe as Pokemon sword shield gym crowd cheers.
Ok got it Gacha lookin game Empty world mobile game  Sans being bought by Disney
I’m so freaking pumped I love kingdom hearts so much!
Ah... Bliss....
Hades is back
The funniest part of this whole reveal is also finding out that the guy who voices Donald Duck in this trailer also voices Akiyama from Yakuza.
4:33 this is similar font style and transition effect as from versus 13 trailers, is it not??
Seriously another app. My phone cant hold what I need and games. Kh4 looks great, quick time events, and several kh3 abilities are shown.
*SORA WITH FREAKING DRILL FORM GURREN LAGANN, LETS GOOOOOO BABIEEEEEE  , 👶*
6:30 Are we now crossing over with Gurren Lagann too? Cool!
Now the waiting game begins! Can't wait to play this!
My child hood self just winked at me.
Dr. Strange at the end of video???
Absolutely phenomenal trailer. (spoilers)       1:37 To start, the final chapter of Dark Road is going to give us some important details for the plot going forward. Especially the details of Young Xehanort and the Master of Master's conversation. That's promising.   3:54 I wasn't expecting a new mobile game, set in Scala ad Caelum, right around the time when Brain woke up and saw that statue of Ephemer. This is going to be interesting. Kingdom Hearts: Missing - Link.  ...  4:14 And the part that everybody was hoping for, with extra.  4:56 It's a new style, and it looks pretty good. I can see the similarities to FF7 remake.  5:05 Yeah, I figured she'd be showing up eventually.  5:21 We can see that ordinary people are going about their ordinary lives in this place. Or at least, they would be if not for the Heartless.  Overall, I liked what we got for the upcoming developments.  No sign of Yozora so far, but that could change in the future.  And I couldn't help but note that Sora is now wearing more realistic shoes.
Most impressive
Ohhhhhhhhhhhjjj myyyyyyyy Gooooooooooooood
LETS GOOOO!!!!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO!!!!! KINGDOM HEARTS IV CONFIRMED!!!!!!!!!!!
Kingdom hearts has been with me my whole life and honestly....is my only personality trait. Seeing sora grow up with me is so nice. Wish i could be more like him tho🤣
So excited for the next chapter!! KH really has come a long way!!
J GOOFY
Shibuya meltdown!
LEETTSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
OMG, the Missing Link announcement being for mobile was really disappointing, but then, seein HER in the next trailer, that was pure and warming happiness
That was quick for KH standards
im in total shock that i had to watch it 5 times. im incredibly in shock this is amazing
YAY, Crappy mobile games!
we definitely need more MOM screentime..excited for it!
Holiday 2035
Yay a Mobile game! And KH4
Are Donald and Goofy looking for Hades in the end? I’m not sure that’s how you’re bringing Sora back boys but I like the energy
...........I was not expecting to even see KH4 in this LIFETIME after how long 3 took.  You mean we're not gonna get a million interquels before we get it this time?
Worlds we need to see in KH4  Moana  Wreck it Ralph Breaks the internet Inside Out  Frozen 2
Awesome! 🙌🙌🙌🙌
As an unironic fan of both Kingdom Hearts and FFXV, this has got to be the greatest thing I have ever seen in my life.
Lol I don't think I'll still be around when KH IV will be released in 2035. Sad
What is with japans obsession with combining every story to our world?
Thanks for making my morning! My life’s been pretty tough lately but this certainly helped
人の命は永遠ではない もう20年… 生きてる間にKHのストーリー完結を望むよ
Was that Hades at the end?
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE ALL IM ASKING IS MAKE THIS A WORLD WIDE RELEASE!!!!!
THANK YOU SQUARE SOFT AKA SQUARE ENIX FOR THE TEARS OF JOY I LITERALLY JUST SHEDDED, THIS WAS MUCH NEEDED FOR MY DEPRESSION!!!
✌🏾🌎… Before this video hit a million BUTTON
The DEARLY BELOVED from Missing Link is GODDDDD. They always know how to step up that song each game.
Everybody moved
Wow, Tetsuya Nomura is DETERMINED to make Final Fantasy Versus XIII, even if it means subsuming the Kingdom Hearts franchise into his vision. That aside, why is Sora's hair so different? Obviously his hair has been a little different in every iteration of him, but it's always been easily recognizable. This hair doesn't look anything like the others. You know what I mean? Does anyone else think he looks like Hope Estheim from FFXIII? Are we sure we're not being clowned on again and this isn't actually Sora but another Sora clone of some kind, like when KHII came out and we were confused about Roxas? Does Sora just not have any hair gel in Quadratum? This is all just to say, if it is really Sora, I don't like the hair. I also may be in the minority, but I like big-shoe Sora and will be sad to see that go. I want to play as an anime Disney boy, not a kid in loafers. The graphics look really good. It looks like they're reusing some animations from KH3, so Sora will probably control very similarly, which I am fine with. I am extremely pleased that they seem to be wanting to make the Disney villains (like Hades) relevant again? Please? PLEASE? Can the Disney stuff actually be relevant and the Disney villains be involved in the larger plot, like in KH1? Better yet, can Final Fantasy characters share equal relevancy with Disney? Whatever. Anyway. I guess I'm excited by this news, but I'm looking forward to seeing more. And I'm curious how long this will be in development, considering I hope and pray they reuse as many KH3 assets as possible. See y'all in hopefully less than 10 years. Side note: I love the logo! I love that they managed to still make it look like the usual pillars.
HELL YEAH KH4 and with non Disney characters in the scenes and cars Means CARS IS FINALLY BEING ADDED IN THE GAME!
EVERYBODY STAY CALM! STAY CALM! THIS IS NOT A DRILL! I REPEAT: THIS IS NOT A DRILL!
STRELITZIAAAAA
Honestly it’s cool and everything but they should have ended the series on a high note
Kingdom Hesrts vs.13 is looking great!
At first I was like "oh nooooo, another phone gaaaaameeee which is going to have important loooreeeeee  and then I'm hit with that zetta flare
You guys should fix kingdom hearts on the switch cloud version sucks
Googling "Kingdom Hearts IV" Google: Did you mean "Final Fantasy Versus XIII"
Legit this looks like an FF game and I'm here for it.
You guys should fix kingdom hearts on switch cloud version it sucks
Holy crap an official story recap? Maybe I'll finally understand anything in this series!
IM SO HAPPY ABOUT KH4 THAT THIS MAKES ME WANT TO BEAT OFF!!!
Is this real?! Are we dreaming?! KH4 ANNOUNCEMENT?!?!?!
WOWWWOOOOOOWOOOOW
What a good way tô woke up! Thanks! And please come to Brazil( I mean, seriously, let me play missing link too )
Here's hoping we don't have to wait over a decade this time around.
a little sad that soras hair isnt as spiky as the other games and I will miss it but he looks so cool! and the game looks amazing so far! i am very excited
Please release it in PS4 😢
Anyone else feel weird seeing KH set in a realistic city...not sure how I feel about it.
I'm excited! Also, Sora looks like sht.  Why switch to the FFXV aesthetic?
Okay, I have 3 hours before I go to work, so I can rewatch this about 24 more times. Let's go!
It’s so weird seeing sora with regular shoes and no gloves lol
I don't know how i fell about this. I am curious if square enix/final fantasy characters will return for 4. I enjoyed 3, but it felt like it was missing half it's heart so to speak as a Kingdom hearts game without them.
At the end it's Hades ( again )
I hope there is a FINAL FANTASY character in KH4 😍 Because, in KH3 there are absolutely no FINAL FANTASY characters 😥
OH MY GOOOODDDD THE HYPE IS REEEAAALLL BABY!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
OUT OF THE FUCKING NOWHERE!
See you guys when kh3 releases in a thirty two years
KH4!!!!!
Finallly another co-op kh game! edit: it's a mobile game fuck
6:56 _If you let me say...._  _LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!_
XIGBAR JUST GIVE ME XIGBAR
Nomura te quiero me corrroooooo
IT LOOKS SO GOOD! Great way to start my day today.
This is certainly a treat
I just need Sora to be told about a blonde warrior who showed up Quadratum and you go looking thinking it's cloud only for him to walk out going "Who's Cloud? My name is Jack Garland."
Believe in the me that believes in you sora
Well, Sora's body size finally catch up to his shoes XD
See you guys in 2034.
This must be a dream!
La vie trop hâte !!!!!
Looks amazing , but guess I’ll be 64 by the time I can finally play it lol.
I just hope we see more Final Fantasy characters in KH4
I had no idea I was gonna wake up and see Sora in his Noctis phase!
Well I'm hyped - hopefully this one won't take 14 years to come out.
Nomura san 🙏 Thank youuuuuuu 🤗  You do it sooooo good making our dreams come true 🤩 im so proud of Your son Sora im sure he will do his best 👌 he is already best 👌 Im feeling your love to ur characters 💖 keep going 💪
holy shit
It looks great and all, but I’m hoping it doesn’t end up being too different from the classic games.
im sorry, wait, we don't need to wait a WHOLE ASS DECADE FOR THE NEXT MAINSTREAM TITLE TO THIS SERIES!?!?! what nonsense is this????
Any Kingdom Predictions? That blue fire is probably Hades, so Hercules could return. For Returning, Frozen II (And have Sora be in the story more!) Mini Worlds:  Winnie the Pooh Finding Nemo Soul (with the Ratatouille treatment) New Worlds: Mary Poppins Pocahontas The Incredibles Phineas & Ferb Gravity Falls Moana Coco Encanto Star Wars  Marvel Mario (Switch Exclusive, because Sora is in Smash. And only if it’s not Cloud)
OH MY GOD! Kingdom Hearts IV looks AWESOME!
This looks awesome! I hope to see more soon!
sora finally use normal shoes.. xD
Sora looks soo UNREAL! The Unreality is so real its surreal!
Was bored out of my skull until Donald and Goofy showed up, at which point I freaked out. All that turgid keyblade war arc stuff can't end soon enough and the initially realistic look of 4 was a massive turn off. Good to see my old gaming pals are back as well.
I’m so excited for kingdom hearts 4 what the fuck
lets be real, that doesn't even look like game play, it looks just like the first kh3 trailer, they got the engine running, but in comparison to the final thing this is gonna look like a pre-alpha, so lets just sit down, and wait at least 3 years, and if it really comes out before the second half of 2025 ill eat something gross idk
Good morning lol
IS THAT AXELS VOICE AT THE END?
Omg, I can't wait to play this in 13 years!
Now we are talking. kH4 may be unreal engine 5. Stunning visual of an realistic Japan world. Now its a deal!
KH4: *passing an alleyway in the city*  Donald: *scratching forearms*  “ThiS SeeMs LiKe a GooD SpOt To ScoRe SoMe SmAcK”
After the massive disappointment that was KH3. Here's hoping KH4 can fix the things that went wrong with 3. I.e. More side content, optional bosses, more fleshed out stories for worlds. Etc.
I just can't tell how beautiful the gameplay is, I'm so happy that Kh4 will be releasing this year.
Can I please have TWEWY characters in Kingdom Hearts 4? We’re in Shibuya
Were all SO shook 🤣😂 Dear god lmao
😍😍😍
Yes yes yes!!!! So thrilled!!!
I can't wait to see the full game in a trailer before it comes out again.
40 years from now we shall see kingdom hearts 4 and its HD final remixed  brought to us on the iPhone 40.
I’m happy to be alive watchin this thank you lord🙏🏽
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Oh, I could never play that first game. I'd have far too much fun just letting the enemies kill Xehanort repeatedly. :D
That forest…IS THAT ENDOR?! Did I see a AT-ST
Bruh. I'm going to be in my 40's by the time FF7R is finished. FML.
Square really make us wait forever for KH3 to come out then drop KH4 is only a couple years WTF
I own the All-in-one package... I've spent like 12 hrs on the first one but I always forget to put the disc in and play. It's really a fun game I just end up turning on my computer instead and then lose the whole day.
Definitely not expecting this
I WAS NO EXPECTING THIS. PLEASE MAKE THE FOURTH PART MORE CHALLENGING, LOOKS PROMISING AND SORA LOOKS AWESOME
KH4 huh? Damn! Can't let our boy die out so easily yet huh? Get hype! 😅😁
Time to wait for another 10 years for it to be released
5:00  So soras feet are normal now, he just likes wearing clown shoes.
Final fantasy versus xiii became a reality !
Really hope this is an improvement on KH3, wont be pre-ordering this time, will wait for reviews and gameplay footage first.
AW SHIT, HERE WE GO AGAIN!!!!!
I think that was Hades
AT-ST foot at 4:42? Star Wars confirmed?
Was not expecting a hyper realistic Kingdom Hearts.
MY FAVOURITE GAME EVER , At the end is that hades ready for revenge , I’m already excited  I KEEP WATCHING THE KH4 teaser trailer it’s so good that I wish there was a demo Rn or the actual game because when the actual game comes out I will get it and the missing link too.  "However if you do leave this world behind don’t expect to return to the one the which you came” what’s that mean Does that mean sora can’t return to Kairi and Riku and where are they and why am I getting multiverse vibes and marvel related stuff and Star Wars even   This was amazing and I’m truly hyped but I still have one concern , does that mean there’s no Disney plus series sadly I really wanted one   But KH4 and everything else looks stunning and KH4 look a lot different to the other games.   That missing link looks like fun
Donald and Goofy teaming up with Hades! Lets fuckn goooo!
Hyped
Here's the hoping we get more final fantasy characters in this one I really love the blend of Disney and final fantasy and was very disappointed that  3 didn't have as many characters in it
KHIV AMAZING! Sora looking good. I like how he has no shoes then goes to the normal shoes. Goodbye clown shoes. Also, I think Donald and Goofy are looking for Hades at the end.
Ok see you in seven years
Estuve Aquí
please don't mess with me. This looks too good to be true
I just woke up and this is what i get? A heart attack and fangirl screaming?! Yes please!!!!
So moist right now
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes 🥰
I played KH back in the day, and this is the perfect time to announce another title to the franchise! 👍
Rip Spiky haired Sora, you will be missed
I'm so proud to be a fan of this amazing series
If this would have aired ten years ago, I would have said "Awesome! A new KH! What story might it tell? Which new and old Characters will appear? Who will be the new antagonists? Which Worlds will we visit? How will it be connected to the older titles?" But with all the changes they made to story and characters since Dream Drop Distance, I lost my passion and interest. It seemed like nothing in the world of KH had any weight and everything could just be altered, when it contradicted ideas they had for new games. To make half of the original KH characters more important than they actually were in the older games, by giving them a new backstory or turning them into completly different characters and making most of the villains just misguided good guys, who were deceived by a greater villain, felt hollow. When I watched this trailer, I felt nothing.
Say you didn't want to pay for Disney copyrights without saying it lol JK it looks good!
A new kingdom hearts game announced on my birthday best day fucking ever
I'M SHAKING DUDE I CAN BARELY TALK PROPERLY HOLY SHIT
I was about 5 years old when this game changed my life forever it’s still one of my favorites to this day and it changed my childhood to be just a little bit better than the reality I was facing everyday thank you sora and square enix for making such a masterpiece
Oh my gosh!
I’m pretty sure we were all disappointed with the mobile game announcements at first...    And then we saw some Kingdom Hearts 4 gameplay and we were all excited again!
KH4!! aaaaaaaaaaaaa totally unexpected!
Wait! Is it real?
Ayo...I think star wars is in this trailer yall😬
Bro I really hope the game is on PS4 too and they don't go next gen exclusive, well I hope the release it on PC too
I woke up just a hour ago and checked YouTube and found kh4 this is the best news of my life
You just caught me out the blue with this good stuff
This is the last straw in reviving Just a Pancake.
Just when I thought I was out... THEY PULL ME BACK IN.
KINGDOM HEARTS 4?!My boi all grown up 😭
Man idk… KH3 was kind of a mess. I see it in bargain bins at Target for like $10. I hope the KH4 story has better writers. KH3’s pacing  felt so forced and weird. Ever since KH3 I really try to curb my expectations with this franchise. Hopefully I am proven wrong…
Holy shit! holy shit!! holy shit!!! (○□○)
I wish Missing Link was on console and PC
That was not actual gameplay, the final product may different, just like ff xv, very different with demo
EVERYONE! KINGDOM HEARTS 4 HAS FINALLY CONFIRMED! OH MY GOD! 😱😱😱😱 WE WAS BEEN WAITED FOR 3 YEARS AGO SINCE THE KINGDOM HEARTS 3 WAS RELEASED!
Wut
Hope this is much better than KHIII
THIS IS WORTH THE WAIT.
It feels like a crime to see sora wearing regular sized shoes
Cautiously optimistic about KH4.
OUR BOY'S GROWN UP. AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
Well I'm on that game and I'm new to this!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sora’s grippers
I pray KH4 won't be PS5/Xbox Series exclusive. I hope I won't be forced to buy a PS5
Don’t know what I feel with the looks of Kh4 sure he looks less cartoony since adapted to what world he is in. but feels  weird being in a city and all. But just feels wrong. Can’t explain it. I still wil try it out.
Who asked for this? The whole fun of Kingdom Hearts is traveling to different worlds. No one wants a grey realistic human city world. 😭
Maaaaaan WHAT??! Omg
I just woke up to this and I'm shaking!! This surpassed my expectations for sure!!!! Happy 20th Anniversary Kingdom Hearts! Thank you Nomura, Disney, and Square Enix for making this spectacular franchise!!!
This has been the best day in 3 years. LETS GOOOOOOOO KH4
yeh... shit hapens
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. The new character designs are fucking beautiful
Thank you so much Square Enix and Disney! Definitely happy waking up to this news. Extremely unexpected. Can't wait for this to come. If Square Enix approach to Kingdom Hearts is anything like their Final Fantasy Series we are going to be welcoming a lot more.
I'm gonna need a couple more towels for what I just saw.
I can't wait to play this on 10 years!
THE STARS HAVE ALLIGNED AND THE 13 HEARTS OF DARKNESS AND 7 OF LIGHT HAVE DONE BATTLE
This is ff15 remake tbh lol
You got some balls square , considering how many people hated kh3 myslef included and how you many people you pissed off with final fantasy 7 remake also myself included
kondom heart 4? yeah probably going have to wait for another 15 years
KINGDOM HEARTS 4!?!  MY BODY ISN'T READY 🔥🔥🔥
Strelitzia still young but she's older than Xehanort and Eraqus. Is the time in Quadrantum like the world of Darkness? Also, if his friends find the way to return Sora to the KH world, how much time will take? Will be Sora Younger than his friends too?
5:20 On the building, "D-Eater" and "D-Dream".  The return of Dream Eaters?
5:05 Strelitzia spotted. Poor Marluxia's never gonna find her there.
finally, SMALLER SHOES!!
THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BROO THIS IS LITERALLY JUST PRE-RENDERED WTF IS THIS MOBILE AD
I’m crying right now, so excited for this.
Lol, something feels off considering the gap between two and three....
THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD'VE WAITED 15 YEARS FOR. THAT'S WHAT THE FUCK I'M TALM BOUT LETS GO BABY
No i'm not going through this again it looks the same kind of jank as kh3 first trailer so im starting bets i say at least 10 years if they are dedicated
OMG KINGDOM HEART 4 OH MY GOD serious WOOOOO I goin to cry😭 Is that guy suppose be new Sora in a city COOOOL
Nice design, rather than KH3 Sora which looked so childish! Bet its only on PS5 😅
You guys turn KH into scarlet nexus.... 😐😐😐
Much like a Nobody, this series is a shell of its former self.  Doesn't matter how pretty you make it.
Meh, I'll wait for 'Kingdom Hearts 4.92 Endless Title of Infinity While Sleeping Kudos For You If You're Still Reading - Remastered'
OHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGOD AAAAAAAAAAA  I CAN’T FRICKIN’ BELIEVE IT, IT’S ACTUALLY KINGDOM HEARTS IV, I’M LOSING MY MIND RIGHT NOW OH MY GOOODDDDD
I'm ready. To be disappointed
With the way that Sora was moving around to get to that heartless, I feel like he could end up in Marvel and meet Spider-Man. I'm hoping that's the case!
The only thing that interested me was the giga drill breaker
In all honesty I cannot wait for darkroad to finally start. So square take as much time as you need to complete the fourth entry since with how elaborate the story will go now things will be so much different than the previous games
OMG,I am excited for the future of KH 1.I only played KH UX for a bit and didn't even play DR,but the dark road stuff looks amazing 2.I have never been more excited for a mobile game more than I have about Missing Link,it looks like there is going to be customization, several world from the KH series (like Union X),and a story that might connect a lot of pieces from the story of the Xeanort Saga and maybe hint at stuff to the new saga 3. Kingdom hearts 4 looks SICK,I love that there are new parkour elements, darkside look awesome, the quadratum looks like it could be an open world hub, and the graphics look STUNNING.
Can't to play the 2 KH mobile game. :D
Another 10 year wait for an potential disappointment. KH3 wait and performance left me sour
Can everyone please stop setting games in realistic world settings. It's not fun, it's not cute. The real world requires zero creativity.
Alright I’ll see you guys in 4 years
Square Enix: Sorry, Nomura you can't make Final Fantasy Versus XIII" Nomura: We will see about that...
Missing-Link = Pokémon Go
Sora has finally made it into the real world ಥ‿ಥ and the clown shoes are a thing of the past
🥳🥳🥳
I thought Kingdom hearts 4 will be announced in 9-10 years. This was unexpected.
Well I’m super excited thanks square you’re the best
OMGGGG
In gonna assume that it'll either get a PC version via EGS exclusivity or not get one at all because Japan.
I don't know if anyone noticed how similar Kingdom Hearts & Naruto are to each other OrganizationXIII Akatsuki Madara & Hashirama Xehanort & Eraqus
OH MY FUCK HYPE HYPE HYPE IM 5 MINUTES AWAY FROM CARDIAC ARREST HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
Hoping kh4 is good, kh3 was a bit disappointing
My gosh the graphics 🥺☺️🤩😱
They really got us hyped up this time don't they? This is freaking awesome! Not only do we have a confirmation of Kingdom Hearts 4, but a new mobile game and a new chapter for Unchained X. I knew they would do something special for the 20th anniversary. I'm so excited!
Well someone in square Enix wants to be churned out kh4 fast
From ‘02 to ‘22 Kingdom Hearts has come a long way. This was my first game as a child In 2nd grade that I could comprehend Ever since then, it’s been my #1 video game & series.(souls/Borne games #2 lol). I’m happy & proud to be a KH fan 😭
Those stockings of Strelitzia are the best of this trailer
Kingdom hearts 4 al fin,esperemos que salga nuevos universos de disney y pixar,esperemos que salga universos de marvel y star wars.
I hope Kingdom Hearts 4 keeps these ultra HD graphics in the game. This looks so good.
Yo imagine if Donald and goofy came to this world walking around as a a normal duck and dog lol
That beginning of the KHIV trailer sounds so like Somnus, plus interesting how Nomura 'Noctised' Sora. He will be getting his Versus XIII after all! ❤️
"Why is it always phone game"  Also KH3 on steam, where you at?
My heart.
😱😱😱
I’m a little bummed KH4 isn’t  partially kairi/Riku looking for Sora. I want Kairi to have her own game for once. Maybe it will be, but this trailer didn’t show any of that. I hope KH4 learns from the mistakes KH3 made.
WHHHHHHHHOA
Okay, I'm up for the day, le- YouTube the fuck is that? WHAT DO YOU MEAN KH4 IS ANNOUNCED? HELL FUCK, NOW I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO BED, JUST TO PASS TIME FASTER!
Kingdom Hearts meets Disney Infinity.
Oh shit.  Alright.
I can't wait!!!  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌟🌟❤️🌟🌟
I’m crying 😭♥️ I’ve loved this franchise so much since KH the original in 2002. I have loved every journey since. I cannot wait!! Buzzing right now!!
The best morning EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
While KH4 looks very good, unfortunately  after playing KH3, I have major trust issues with Disney.
I got my Keyblade, I am ready
05:15 Sora has a normal human feet
Ooooo exciting. I'm guessing PS5.
PISSING MYSELF RN
"If this isn't the ending you wanted- of it brings you despair- then leave this world for others" (paraphrasing).  I think I will. Last decent KH game was BBS.
I'm happy KH4 is being actively worked on this quickly but Imma wait until we see real gameplay.
Wish they would stop putting essential lore in freaking phone games but still excited about the new game.
My main question is what will Roxas and Xion etc be doing in these new games
Whoa, this is huge.
Wow, kingdom hearts 4 looks so fricking amazing!!! I have never been this excited seeing a trailer. Holy heck haha. Hyped for days now!!
I wasn't expecting Kingdom Hearts 4 this soon!
Love it - but didn’t see any square relatives (again)
shakn n cryn rght now
The KH4 trailer reminds me a lot of the FF vs 13 trailer and that game was scrapped and repurposed for FFXV. Hopefully this time we’ll get to see KH4 realized and not  delayed to hell and repurposed.
KH4?!!! LETS GOOOOO
Is this how they put MCU in KH?
Bro, I am crying. I was waiting for this game for too much. May your Heart be your guiding Key. ❤️
Yoooo look at his normal size shoes :D
Also very much looks like 9th gen exclusive.  Hope everybody got their PS5s.
Nomura's still salty about Versus XIII I see
DO YOU NOW WHEN KINGDOM HEARTS WAS JUST ABOUT FIGHTING DISNEY VILLAINS💀💀
If Kingdom Hearts 4 adds Marvel and Star Wars universe, I’ll love it more. No doubt that KH4 will be on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S
This looks awful. This series has long overstayed its welcome. Square Enix desperately needs new blood, everything has this Nomura-esque stink, from how the character looks to this sterile design. Just fire everyone and hire new people, please.
Everyone waking and seeing this announcement......  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh😍
Honestly if they had no Disney in the 4 game, I will be perfectly fine. I'm 26 not 6 anymore. I can literally play a whole Kingdom Hearts with neither Final Fantasy or Disney. Kingdom Hearts is more special to me then either then those two.
im hella excited for this I cant wait
Omg IM SO HAPPY😭😭😭 byeeee
THANK YOU NOMURA
If I find out that FF characters are again nearly entirely left out of KH4 I will not buy it on principal. And i don't even play much FF
Well this appeared 13 years earlier than expected. Still, I really hope they dont make the same mistakes at KH3, aka making it way too easy, having repurposed content (Frozen's world), and having a story that's essentially non-existent/irrelevant up till the final stage
My body is ready
ok.
Are you fucking serious; how is there still not a Steam release?  Fuck Square Enix and fuck Epic Games, so sick of this bullshit, no wonder so many people pirate.
Hope KH4 comes out so my grandkids can play this game for me... I'm currently 35 years old.
Triste game is Insain cant wait 20??
After the mess that was KH3, I hope they can do better with this game...
Did anyone notice that the girl who was with Sora kind of looks like Ryne from Final Fantasy XIV?
Ah, Sora has become Noctis too, along with Riku and Rex lmaooo
KH4: Isekai Edition
So the question is, who are Donald and Goofy looking for, and what exactly is the blue flame a reference to?
5:56 - Wonder how the Keyblade Wielders are going to cover this one up.
Looks like for KH Missing Link, I might need to buy a much better phone and/or tablet.
Sora died and got reverse isekai’d into Tokyodratum, I freakin’ love it lol!  The graphics and gameplay (at least in concept) look insane!  And as always, more questions arise the deeper and more expansive the story gets lmao, classic!
Uncanny valley Sora.
It's been 20 year. I hype for the more mature redesign.
Please less Disney stuff for KH4
Kingdom Hearts 4???? I feel like I'm being shat on rn
Find out the guy you like, likes someone else oh well KH4 and Sora's Graphic gahhhhhhh instantly better now 😅
I just woke up now all tired and sad cuz i have an exam next day but this ...... this just made me whole year
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
Like to believe Sora entered the real world why he looks normal
*STRELITZIA AND THE OTHERS ARE ALIVE??!?!?!?!?!!!!!!!!?!!!*
I'll wait the 20 years out takes 😅. But for real in a timely matter. WE HAVE THE TECH TO MAKE A GREAT GAME WITH GREAT QUALITY. DO NOT RUSH THE GAME.  I'm also looking forward to the new IOS/Android game
looks boring, it's not 2004 anymore
Will be 24 this year and this game still has a place in my life to this day from when I was 8 years old.
Kh4???? I- I wasn't expecting this at all wha HYPPEEEEEEEE
Not expecting and kingdom hearts 4 announcement especially in this new direction there going for but i actually really like this direction. Can't wait to see more about this game in the future.
This shouldn't be. They should've ended the story with 3 instead of dragging it on. Disappointing
I'm sick of these movie type trailers it means nothing. Show some actual real graphics and gameplay not this garbage.
Bro I think my house is gone because this whole video was fire 🔥
😢 ESTOY muy feliz 😊!! * no pensé que fueran a sacar un nuevo KM... Gracias gracias
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh im freaking out right now  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
This is awesome considering it’s took them over 10 years for kingdom hearts 3 to release.
Giga... Drillll.... BREAKKEEEERRRRR
Uaooooooooooooooooooooooo
I hope it's for Playstation and Xbox and so any platform user's can enjoy
And so.....it begins again
YO WTF SORA HAS GROWN AS SHIT
Yesssss!!!!! Omg yooooooo I'm ready I'm definitely ready yesssss hahahahahahaha
IS THAT A FUCKING AT-ST FOOT AT 4:42
KINGDOM HEARTS 4 LETS FUCKIN GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Im sorry Kingdom Hearts FOUR?
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
Man kh4 looks absolutely stunning
The freaking glow up for Sora!!! I’m so pumped for all of this!!!
3 wasn't that great so tempering expectations.
Actual Kingdom Hearts IV?!! This is wild!!
KH4 Set to Release in 2037 lmaooo🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I actually don't mind that there's a new mobile game. I just want Nier Reincarnation to be done by the time it releases; can't play 2 substantial mobile games at once.
I quite literally grew up alongside this series, so seeing this kinda “update” is crazy cool. Honestly a slap to the face to go from 3 to 4 so quickly.     I’m scared but kinda excited bout this
I FULLY CRIED WHEN I SAW SORA
I am HYPED!!! Lets! GOOOOO!!!! 💙💙💙🗝🗝🗝
Something something drill something something pierce the heavens  Anyways, whoa KH4 and it's like kaiju edition apparently lol
This is a dream come true. What a masterpiece this will be.
See y'all in like 8 years
If Kingdom Hearts is a TV series, the numbered games are best thought of as Season Finales.
Looking forward to what the English dubbing will sound like. The visuals look very nice. Hoping we will see Yozora in this game. Happy Birthday to Haley Joel Osment (Sora and Vanitas) and belated to Jesse McCartney (Roxas and Ventus).
Holy shit, just saw this in Twitter and had to double check. There is AT-ST foot at the 4:42.  STAR WARS IN KH4 LETS GOOO!
5:24 ソラ達にとっては死の世界だから、その関連で冥界神のハデスが最後に出てきたってこと？
4:06 KH4 Trailer
See y’all in 2030 when this comes out
Sooo is KH4 going to focus on Disney again or no because THATS the only thing that matters with this series. KH3 was a letdown and they threw away Maleficent who was the main villain in KH1.  If the whole game is set in the real world it’s a HARD PASS
I guess we'll just have to wait until all those three new games get release and then we might get our answer😒
5:58 and Sora's not using big clown shoes again!
Sora made it to New Donk City
I don't care how but please let there be Cloud/Sephiroth in this game!! Game looks amazing!
I need to complete the All in One package now. I’m still in the beginning of the first game
Here we go again.
I see Nomura still feels a way about Versus XIII... Hope he gets lucky this time.
I know SE is making their games more edgy and "modern" to appeal to the GenZ, so I'm not surprised by this trailer but.. All I'm hoping, is that KH4 is more Disney then KH3. I hope this game isn't serious and dramatic all the way through, and still has it's goofy and light-hearted moments just like the older KH games.   Setting that aside, the game definitely looks great. But looks isn't the only thing about a game, so I'll just have to wait and see if my hype grows more with every trailer released.
THE CONNECTION HAS BEEN MADE!!!
Puñetaaaaaaaa
DARK ROAD IN AUGUST.  3D SCALA MOBILE GAME.  3D MODELED BLAINE!!!  STRELIZIA'S NOT ONLY ALIVE, SHE'S IN QUADRATUM! (Joins the Party?)  REALISTIC PROPORTIONS, "KINGSGLAIVE"-LOOKING SORA (Almost didn't recognize him with normal shoes...)  THE KINGDOM KEY HAS A PROPER FORMCHANGE AT LAST! (Lingering Will's whip, anybody?)  THE SINGLE BEST LOOKING DARKSIDE HEARTLESS TO DATE!  TWO HOODED FIGURES. Obviously, one is The Master of Masters but why would the other one be hooded...?  SOLO DISNEY GANG GAME. (Woo! Hades is back!)  AND SORA'S ONLY BEEN HERE FOR A WEEK. What that tells me is that he either beat Yozo at the 104 building and he woke him up a Week later, OR he's still on the run from him... Either way, he's gotta make up a whole Year here without returning to the others for Riku (WHAT'S HE GONNA LOOK LIKE?!) to come get him out...  I LITERALLY CANNOT WAIT FOR ANY OF THIS!!! NOMURA!!!!!
I WOKE UP TO THIS IM TOO EXCITED OMG KHIV??
His journey is not over yet.
My man, this was a ride
5:06 But the one thing that Kingdom Hearts drop the bomb is "Sora meeting Strelitzia" like how is she here
omg can’t wait to see this be released in 2027 😍
Glad to see James Woods will be getting another paycheck
I hope Gravity Falls and Star Vs comes to KH4
8 años minimo....
興奮して今日寝れないかもしれん
New Spiderman looks good
OH MY FUCKING GOD
<3
YASSSSS!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
THE FOREST IS ENDOR, THERES A WALKER FOOT IN THE TOP RIGHT CORNER  LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO
Did sore turn his keyblade into a “GET OVER HERE!” Whip.😱😱😱
OOH MY GOD
Ff13 collab??
So awesome and weird to see Sora in Final Fantasy style graphics, which is definitely going to be amazing!  Spoiler Alert, I just know that the guy behind them is going to be Hades
I really don't want to get too excited cause we probably won't see KH4 for another 10 years... but I'm excited.
I thought sora was gone forever I’m soo happy
Ill be back when its done in 10 years.
KH versus 13
Bruh Donald and goofy are stuck in the smash bros reveal void 🤣
Just hope that KH4 can bring the series redemption after KH3 failed.
My brain is bleeding and my balls have been drained
button remapping or no buy
🧡🧡🧡
I’m really wondering; did they just go really hard on the realistic graphics or is this on Unreal Engine 5?
KINGDOM HEARTS IS BACK BABY!!
OH MY GODDDDDDD
KH4!?!!?!? Eso sí es empezar muy bien el día
Hades??
I really hope you don't mess this one up Square Enix... KH3 was very underwhelming for multiple reasons.
Nomura be straight-up ripping  on Gurren Lagaan now, SMH.
4:42 THATS THE FOOT OF A WALKER FROM STAR WARS AT TOP RIGHT
Bruh
HYYYYYYPE!!!!
Im crying already i dont think i csn handle the game guys
Kingdom Hearts 4: Sora comes to the real world - Final Mix 3.7/ π Days - Definitive Edition XL
This better be on Xbox Series X & PS5, I need to see my boy Sora in 4k 😤
Oh I can’t wait for the disney worlds hope there are like 15 worlds or something please Nomura make it happen please !!!!
Kingdom Hearts 4 Versus 13
Can’t believe it! KH4 looks so good! The present day setting, Sora and Kairi’s new look, how they look more realistic, that freakin Heartless!!! This has gotten me pumped and can’t wait to see the final product. Also can’t wait to see the other characters (especially Yozora).
What a way to wake up on a Sunday morning! I’m excited to play this!😍
Well I’m crying at perfection again
When I watched the KH4 trailer... I can guarantee my heart went straight to "Nuclear Bomb Alert."🤯 it's really fun and now I can't wait for KH4 to come out.!!!😘♥️🗝️
I DONT THINK I HAVE EVER BEEN SO ENERGIZED WAKING UP AND SEEING THIS IM SO HAPPY!!
This is a birthday gift I didn’t know I wanted.  Thank you, Disney and Square-Enix!
So many questions are running through my mind and yet I don't even know the answers to them
HOLY CRAP!!! Kh4!!!! I hope we don’t have to wait another thirteen years.
i was 12 when kingdom hearts came out now i'm 32 and now they announce KH4. Oh, the nostalgia running through my body
KH3 was a disappointed; Square and the team please bring back this beloved series to the epic game it was!!!
My boi Sora finally got them fitting J’s and a glow up 😭 he look like he got his crap together and has a 740 credit score
Honestly didn’t look that good but we shall see how it plays out🤷🏻‍♂️
Well shit time to do another 100% play-through again 😂
3:58 and what exactly is Kingdom Hearts missing like does it show us on how Scala ad Caelum was created
Really didn’t expect this today but I’m so thrilled! 😁
Kh4 in less than 10 years since  3??? I don't have to wait until I'm in my 40's to play this? No deluge of pointless releases on competing game platforms? Wow. I must be in the Sleeping Worlds. Someone use the Power of Waking on me
Every new iteration of Sora looks more and more like a final fantasy character and less like a scrimblo disney character, it's great.
YOOOOOOOOOOO KH4 LOOOOOOKS FUCKING AMAZIIIIING WTRFFFFFFF AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Why is he real
If im not wrong the fourth option in the command menu while he is fighting darkside says build? BUILD!?!
I was 7 years old when I first played KH , I first played it when I visited my friend in another city and he actually gave me his copy of KH1 (something he jokingly confessed he sort of regretted years later lol , which I can totally understand) and it was one of the first videogames besides Pokémon I fully completed for myself, from Beginning to end which started a 20 year long love for this series I am less than a month away from my 27 th birthday and this series still holds such a special place in my heart. Thank you Square and Disney for all the memories , til this when I hear simple and clean I am transported back to that 7 year old watching in awe at the crazy graphics at the end of KH 1 when Kairi leaves Sora at the Door to Darkness  Here's to another 20 years
People recording on their phones when a giant monster shows up is pretty realistic also..soras new design though 😲 his hair looking neat
wow....that was fast. I was hoping we could now play as someone besides Sora but the modern look is pretty cool, I'll admit
This was a nice surprise to wake up to this morning! haha
Somebody start the 6 year count down!
Steam release soon please!!!!
any japanese around can throw a hint of who is the one at the end?
... Ok
For all you guys who've stuck around with the series, seen its story grow and fall in love with its characters - the announcement is finally here. It's time for Kingdom Hearts 4.
Got it memorized?👈🏻🔥
🖤Kingdom hearts 4:Versus 🤍
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Si ya hay gente que se aburrió por la espera de KH3.
KH4 looks like the FF15 we wanted but never got 😭
Yes!!!!!!!!!! I can’t wait this is going to be epic
20 years for that master piece to come out..
Hope KH4 coming PC too.
you can save the handheld bs.. just give me the main course! Excited to get back in reins for Sora's journey🔥
so that was clearly Hades from Hercules at the end of the KH4 trailer (blue flame, turned bright red...classic Hades)
Not gonna lie. The beginning Music of the KH4 trailer reminds me of Somnus from FF15.
Looks like Sora from Wish. Really ugly character design
its took almost 16 years between kh2 and kh3 please let it end here. let them be together already.
Sora has a Giga Drill Break now, i stg
Not a fan that it's so hyper realistic tbh, but it'll probably look better as they work on it
OMG!!!!!!!
To think I bought this game as a seven year old because it had a cool anime cover. 20 years later it still has me hooked
1:00 and what exactly happened to all those new characters
Not what I expected to wake up to this morning, but I’m ready for it!   Let’s go baby!!!
Seeing Sora's feet and then him wearing normal shoes is so weird after the Disney clown shoes he wore! That and his hair looking actually sane!
Ok, a blue flame that turns red, Donald and Goofy are afraid of him, and a deep voice? MY GOD THATS HADES. Donald and Goofy are in the underworld!
*Sees Sora's Feet*  HACHAAMA/Gura/Mumei: hehehe A fine addition for my COLLECTION..
WAS THAT GIRL STRELITZIA!!!?
I'm so hesitant to be hyped. KH3 was all spectacle and no substance until the last section of the game, retconning the PERFECT Sora dying concept. We could have shed Sora, or left him in the darkness, have a new trio rise, be told stories of Sora from the current 9 keyblade masters and then reveal Sora later on in a trilogy. I hope this game has substance.
See you 13 years later
didnt expect this.....goshhh
Woah, I was expecting to wait another 14 years for KH4
don't do this to me. please, square I am begging you, do not make anymore things to waste my paycheck on anymore, please have mercy on my bank account.
Wow I wasn't expecting that
Taking all Bets, Taking all Bets, put your money on KH4 Release Year, All bets are on Boys!
Sora is now spider man
Hole shit 😱 KH4
Kingdom Hearts 4 looks awesome can’t wait to see more
I was 9 years old when I started playing kingdom hearts and it made me so happy before now I'm crying of seeing Kingdom hearts 4 trailer and falling in love with the game that I cherish with all my heart ❤
Tunggu 13 tahun lagi
0:43 Has anyone ever stopped till notice the new characters kh dark road
HADES?!
HOLY. CRAP. Did I just see UNREAL ENGINE 5 SORA??
I hope the final game looks at least as good as the reveal trailer this time. Cool stuff
Pause at 4:42. That is literally the foot of an AT-ST. On the planet Endor. STAR WARS IN KH CONFIRMED!!!
*TANGINA NAMAN MATUTULOG NA KO E*
5:40 IS THAT CHAOS?!
IV??!! I was not expecting this at all!! Absolutely cannot wait to dive back into this world again
Nitip jejak
Well honestly I have mix feelings about kh 4 after disappointing kh3 but am excited as well….. I hope sora is mature and a bit edge
AYO
I am SCREAMING!!!! SORA IS BACK BABY!!! Well…. Sort of 😭 oh my god this was all too much to handle,  I’m in a pool of emotions 😭😭🖤
FOUR!
This trailer got me off guard. Guess the journey is not over after all.
Oh wow we didn't get ten side games before iv!?
KH4 BOIIIIIIII
BRO LOOK AT MY BOI ALL GROWN UP I CANNOT CONTAIN MYSELF TIGHT NOW!!!!
Are we just gonna ignore Sora doesn’t have his overly large clown shoes anymore?
It's sooooo beautiful 😭😭😭
Super HYPED!! Happy Anniversary Kingdom Hearts! I can't believe it's been 20 years!
I REALLY hope Sora gets his Happy Ending FINALLY!
This franchise is going in such a strange direction. Barely even recognize it next to kh1 and 2. Kh3 was already not the best. Skeptical but hopeful
Hopefully, KH4 video game will be going to be developed in a shorter time than KH3 & have a better story. Given typical Square Enix habits when it comes to releases of mainline FF & KH-related video games, I won't be surprised if this game might be released at the almost end cycle of PS5 Pro & Xbox Series X Pro or Ultra (whatever MS gonna name it) as well as the beginning cycle of PS6 or Series X's unknown successor, IN 2026/2027 😂😂😂!!!
can we actually have final fantasy characters in kingdom hearts this time around thanks. 3 was a disappointment please do better.
FF15 I HEAR NOCTIS AND THAT MUSIC IT IS FF15
Holy s hit. I can't wait to play this in 2033.
So tired of mobile games. But that end game 🔥 🔥 🔥
Welp time for u guys who dont have the next gen consoles to start hunting. I highly doubt its gonna be cross gen this time around. But did not expect this surprise 1st thing in the morning
It feels surreal having a kh4. Definitely wasn’t mentally prepared for it when I woke up
MY HEART OMGGGGGGG
Bros this is extremely exciting
YES!!!! KINGDOM HEARTS  4!!! AND A NEW ONLINE KINGDOM HEARTS GAME!! LETS GOOOO!!!!!
Axel Donald and goofy trio?
DID ANYONE SEE THE FOOT OF AN AT-ST AT 4:42 SORA IS GOING TO YAVIN 4!!!!!
I'm gonna get Minnie mouse pregnant in this one
It’s too soon to announce kh4…
Que lindo es despertar, entrar a YouTube y ver esto, que ganas tengo que salga KH4 para jugarlo!
Oh my fucking god, its happening  Curse goober and dolan models incoming lfggg
I KNEW DISNEY CHARACTERS WOULD APPEAR IN KINGDOM HEARTS 4!!!
Encanto world.  Let's go!  🇨🇴/🇯🇵
HOLY SHIIIIIIIIII THAT'S AWESOME
I CRIED!!!
I’ve never clicked on a video so fast 😱😱
The biggest question is why does the guy in KH4 have the kingdom key
Kingdom Hearts 3 reminded me of Kingdom Hearts 1/Traditional so Part 4 is going to have that Part 2/Experimental influence can't wait
I just woke up, the last few years have been nothing but darkness, and I almost was lost to it. But this is the first bit of light I’ve felt in a long time . . . Kingdom Hearts 4 . . I cannot believe it
Realistic Sora with normal shoes does exist and can't hurt you Realistic Sora with normal shoes:
The Kingdom Hearts Resurrections
I am here for Cloud Strife Emo Hair Sora and Kaiju Darkside
5:05 Strelitzia!! She is really beautiful, gorgeous!!
I am happy we are getting all of this, the Dark Road finale, a new game showing what happened to Brain and KHIV with realistic graphics and a girl that looks like Strelitzia!? I really need to see if it’s really her.
Fucking hate KH
Last time I felt like this they announced Sora for smash.
That new sora's mmhhh....
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY FUCKING MONEY
The massive Heartless design is brilliant. All I can really say is holy shit!
Kh4 oooomgg
I still haven't played the first one yet...
so sora getting Ieskaied to our world after dying again
*HAPPY 34TH BIRTHDAY, HALEY JOEL OSMENT: THE VOICE OF SORA*!!!!🥳🎂👑♥️🗝*       *And Vanitas😅   #KINGDOMHEARTS20THANNIVERSARY
HOLY SHIT!!!! SOMEBODY GIVE ME A MOTHERFUCKING TABLE TO FLIP!!!!
KH4 GOTY
YEEEESSSSSSSSS
Can't wait to see where the next good spots to find some ingredients will be...
I can't believe it's real. that's amazing thank youuuu
This is awesome
Kingdom Hearts IV when? I really want to see Riku on the mission to find Sora.
yall gonna make the pc remakes have native ultrawide support as part of this event right?
They looking so beautiful
Cant wait for any of this content! Amazing news! 😍
I’ve been joking about this to myself all this time, but it’s real. Kingdom Hearts 4 is actually happening. What do I even do about this?
Who is the guy, donald and goofy are looking for??? HADES? or a FF character like Auron or Cloud 😳🥵
I would be so invested if it wasnt for KH3, man the games have sucked way too hard post 2010
you know It's based on real world when people still bother to record the whole thing before running away
From Disney… oh, is this a child groomer simulation game?
After how garbage KH3 was, I can't say I'm even remotely interested in playing KH4.
They really did done go and flash Strelitzia being done dirty, ya gutsy bunch.
Here's hoping they make a more mature game. I've got whites in my hair now. I don't want a kiddy game.
I'm very curious to see where kingdom hearts 4 takes us. I'm hyped. I also laughed when I saw that Sora actually has normal sized shoes 😂
Shut up shut the fuck up i started crying ive been looking forward to this for years fuck what the fuck
my soul left my body
Yes
I screamed!! Present day Kingdom Hearts 4 my heart ❤️ ❤️ 🤎🤎 I'm ready to battle the darkness!
I am so fucking confused but I'm so excited!!
Bro sora learned how to change his base keyblade like the lingeringwill did(or terraif you want to be specific).
Hades??
4:42  STAR WARS?!?!?!?
I don't think I've ever screamed louder than when I saw Strelitzia.
Boy I'm excited for this!!!!!
...anticipating to see how the story will grow! And to see sora again, may it be in a different setting
I need this game O_o
Mobile games aren’t hype. Going for more realism in KH4 visuals is disappointing.
NOMURA'S REVENGE!
Although we’re never going to get it, kingdom hearts 4 looks insane
Adoro essa franquia
I hope that this means it's a next gen only game.
KH4?!?! After 17 MORE spinoff titles, 6 more filler titles, KH4 freshly announced for the PS9! yay!!! TBH though, there's so much twist and blah blah, I just don't even care about KH anymore.
I cried, not even gonna lie. Y'all each have a wonderful day.
For the love of god Nomura. Fucking drop organization XIII already. He needs to stop using the same assets to make the story any more convoluted. I swear, if kh4 is going to be 5 different games across 7 platforms just to tell a single convoluted story, I. Am. Done. KH's story went to shit after kh2, maybe even after kh1. Please make a coherent story with characters we actually care about and stick with them?
Just when I thought I was out, they pull right back in....
I KNEW KH4 IS COMING THIS EARLY WOOHOOOOOOOO (Better be available for PS4 or else)
4:42 Look at the top right, people are saying that looks like an AT-ST Walker's feet. Star Wars world confirmed?
THEY'RE FINALLY MAKING KH4!? WOW I DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN RIGHT NOW!
We won’t see this game for 10 years lol
Holy crap   His feet are finally a normal size
I don't care about the mobile games but excited for Kingdom Hearts 4!!
I hope we get a Zootopia world or at least have Judy as a summon.
Crying from excitement! 😭😭
PS7 Exclusive.
Ooo So donalnd and Goofy were at the bottomless pitt of the underworld looking for Hades? Mmm intresting.. wonder how this duo will find their way back to Sora.
So, Quadratum has Final Fantasy-esc look to it (no surprise, I've, and a lot of people, have already theorized it's based off Final Fantasy Versus 13, a.k.a. Final Fantasy 15), Sora has a more FF look to him, the Darkside had a more FF look to him, Strelitzia is alive and hanging out in Quadratum, meaning Lauriam, and maybe Elrena. should pop up, and Donald and Goofy have run into a character they're choosing to conceal, but is connected to blue flames (Ardynn, perhaps?). I can't wait to see more of Kingdom Hearts 4.
Let's all give a HUGE Round of Applause for Kingdom Hearts 20th Anniversary/Birthday! 🎉🎈🎂🎁🍰🥳🎉🎈🎂🎁🍰🥳
Looks like KH went FF on us
Oh my God  Another 10 Years of Wait
Watch were gonna wait until 2026 😂
You people are wack. This looks terrible. Lol
Was that fucking Strelitzia
I can already see my ps5 blowing up
Hades at the end 100% Who else is represented by blue fire turning red
It's the month of Ramadan and I'm fasting so sometimes I hallucinate due to hunger so in sort I need to know is this real?
Man I'm not regi I ain't even started KH3
We will meet in 2027 Kingdom Heart 4 ! 🥲
Needed to rewatch a few times... does that for real say 4?
Is the kh3 remind dlc gonna go on sale?
Oh my God, what happiness, you can come!!
Damn I’m almost 30 can’t believe we are here boys.
Ah yes more random spin offs and other stupif shit please nomura dont make the same mistake as the xrhanort saga
5:05 is strelitzia!!!!
I never would see Kingdom hearts 4 taken place in the present times, this looks amazing 👏
i'm old
i hope the world plots arent as lazy as kh3
.... see I kinda liked the cartoony style due to the disney influence. While KH4 looks awesome with those graphics, its not a kingdom hearts game anymore. Its a Final Fantasy game with KH elements at that point.
This is Kingdom “Death Strading” Heart 😻😻
This is THE best news to wake up to on my birthday
Kingdom Hearts becoming less Disney and more Final Fantasy
Was that... SANS at the end  with the blue Fire?
hmm
Beautifull, amazing... great way for Kingdom Heats  :D
Donald: Sora's dead. We need to get to the afterlife to help him for his next journey.  Hades: So I get to kill the both of you?  Goofy: Well, uh... Yeah?  Hades: This is... *Starts chuckling terrifyingly like he's just won the lottery* Great. The only way this could be better is if Hercules was offering himself up on a silver platter too.  Goofy: Donald, I'm starting to think this wasn't that good of an ideal-  Hades: *Speaks again before Donald can voice his agreement with Goofy* Anyway... *Has a savage smile on his face as his hair lights up in yellow and orange flames as his skin reddens* TIME TO FEEL THE HEAT!  *Donald and Goofy died horribly that day as they wanted to, unfortunately they did not end up in Quadratum.*  *They instead ended up in Shibuya and had to play the Reaper's Game with Riku who got yeeted there by Yozora.*
"Looks to be a slightly Older Sora in a Different style"
6:00 Holy moly, I got goosebump when the keyblade shows up
Insane !!!! 😱😱😱😱
So.. this Quadratum is like the mirror world of TWEWY? I was hoping Sora stuck in Neku and Joshua world, I hope Tetsuya-san put them in the game..
I think that's Yozora's portal in the end  or Yozora's teleport passage whatever you call it
I can’t wait for both KH4 and Missing Link cuz both look so good and I definitely see more of the Final Fantasy influences graphic wise for the series going forward 😊
Woke up hungover but all that cleared up when I seen the headlines of KH4 reveal trailer! I may not have to wait until my grandkids kids are born to play this!
4:42   Is that the foot of an AT-ST? That is Endor from Star Wars Episode VI
i'm hoping that the recent vision for KH caught it's stride after 3. i'm probably one of those people who will always buy KH, but i'm hoping Square Enix can move forward and improve on what was given in KH3.
Oh wow this all looks like so much fun can't wait!!!!
Did not expect a Kingdom Hearts 4 trailer this morning, nor did I expect the long awaited return of Dark Road and a new mobile game. Things are looking exciting! BUT ALSO BRING BACK DRIVE FORMS FOR KH4
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
Kingdom hearts 3 was horrible it felt too easy early on and all clumped together hopefully this is different
I'm not a fan of kingdom hearts, so I don't know if that was someone else. BUT WAS THAT FUCKING SEPHIROTH AT THE END OF THE VIDEO?!
So freaking awesome!
Was not expecting a trailer for KH4 from this, let alone one that looks THIS BEAUTIFUL. Legit looks more like a FF game, which I'm not against. The art style is drastically different but that sick, more realistic Darkside (and everything else) is just insaneeeee. I'm hype af. Although not excited about another freaking mobile game... and the gameplay looks lackluster from what we could see, looks like some very similar gameplay to Re:Chain except instead of cards, we use trophies. But I guess we'll see. Edit: Also who do you guys think is the fire guy at the end? My guess was Hades considering the blue and red fire, and that they're going to him for help since he's a GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD/AFTERLIFE AND SORA IS DEAD AND IN SOME SORT OF AFTERLIFE. Man they love having the heroes start their journey at Olympus for advice and help lol.
That shot of Sora running and summoning the keyblade!!!!!
YOU MUST BELIEVE IN SORA !!!!!! Kingdom Hearts 4!!!!!
NOMURA CABRÓN
Doesn't seem like the world that Verum Rex guy came but i liked a lot what i've seem. Super on the wait for IV!! 😆🤘
💀another crappy half baked mobile game....like come on bruh mobile devices have the capability of doing way more than that but  they don't take advantage of its hardware
yeah, I need to actually play the games
Wow. They actually did it. These mad lads are doing a KH4. 😮
Treasure planet  and turbo worlds?
He's beautiful 🥲🥲🥲
Imagine what kind of Disney stuff is gonna be in 4. What if we get Bruno warning Sora about something in his future? Or what about Sora and Luz doing badass parkour across the Boiling Isles while fighting against Heartless and Emperor's Coven Scouts? Or maybe we'll get Sora running around NYC with Alex and Justin and learning new magic and fighting moves from Jerry? The possibilities are endless, man!
Me: "Man, Kingdom Hearts is such a silly and cheesy game, I can't take it seriously, why was I so obsessed with it as a kid? I'm into more serious and mature games now."  Also me when KH announcement: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-"
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Kingdom Hearts 4?! This is so exciting. I’ve been waiting for a new KH game to come out for the Switch. That’s NOT a cloud version
😨😨😨 I only became a Kingdom Hearts fan in early January of this year……… but even after FINALLY playing/experiencing KH1, Chain of Memories, 358 Days, KH2, and Re:Coded SO FAR…. as well as me currently starting my very first playthrough of Birth by Sleep as Ventus…………………. my hype levels for THIS PARTICULAR GAME (AND my burning desire to complete Birth by Sleep, Dream Drop Distance, KH3, and Melody of Memory JUST IN TIME for this game’s release) are THROUGH THE FREAKING ROOF!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  KINGDOM HEARTS IV… We did it guys. The time is FINALLY HERE… to bring Sora home… ONCE AND FOR ALL.😊😌😉
yo me pregunto de cual se fumara Tetsuya Nomura cada vez que le agraga algo a su franquisia interminable weon.... este juego si es que brilla por algo es por su Jugabilidad pero entender su historia que no tiene ni pies ni cabeza loco te puede terminar dando un derrame osea.. para mi KH es una saga en la que Lucran sacando juegos en distinta plataformas y ya. pero seamos sinceros todos ubieramos querido que la saga terminara con el 3 yo a la fecha sigo esperando que el DLC Remind baje de precio porque pagar 23 dolares por un pasillo de 1 hora 30 es estafa,,,
Kingdom Hearts is definitely and totally one of THE Best of the Best Square Enix Games there is from my Childhood Years! Absolutely Love this SO much!
I wasn't excepting wake up to this surprise. As a hardcore KH fan I'm so hyped right now!!!!
LEST FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO IS KH4 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Yo wait, has Sora completely mastered keyblade transformation?  Like, can he turn it into whatever the heck he wants?  Because he was stretching out the chain like a grappling hook, he turned the keyblade into a drill and launched it off, I really hope there's more of that, imagine all the crazy stuff Terra did in kh2fm as lingering will
The only time they had to add blackie is through some shitty 2d game. Way to pander to the lowest common Square Enix. Show dem Libtards and wokes that you care, even just a little.
IM FUCKING CRYING THANK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Yesss. Thank you.
YAY!!!!!!!!!!!! This is Awesome!!! As soon as the Part 4 Game of Kingdom Hearts comes out soon, I'm so going to enjoy playing this! Happy 20th Anniversary/Birthday Kingdom Hearts!
If they're gonna use unreal 5 for this, it's gonna be one sexy game
Better not be another versus xiii for the next main kingdom hearts game. That's what the gameplay looks like, lies
I can't believe SE really put Two mobile games announcements before the other tent pole games.
Damn kh3 already came out huh?
6:25 "THIS IS THE DRILL THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS!!"
First thing first we need a french dub version... Donald Reignoux is Sora and I'm missing him since KH2 goddamit !!
Is that dark-erside lol
Time to wait for the next "Collection" game for a console that will include another phone game to fill in gaps in the story...
I hope KH4 is a maturing of the franchise, i love kingdom hearts but playing 3 made me realise that its getting stale.
KH4….wowwwwwww
......well considering how long 3 took to come out, how much it sucked and how ridiculously convoluted the story has gotten with each new entry.....forgive me if i'm not too "hype" for this
I shit myself when I saw Striletzia. This game looks beautiful! Can’t wait for the team to finish up work on these games! Happy 20th Anniversary KH!
Holy crap!!!!!!
Stretlitzia!
Is this for real? Where tf is the Disney?
Donald and Goofy are looking for Hades :)
Has it been 13 years already?!  Glad hades is making a comeback.  Giga drill break reference is dope. Sora ages a lot in seven days.
Kingdom Heart 4 Nintendo Switch
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
This is awesome! Kingdom Hearts IV here we come!
Sora doesnt have big shoes. wtf 😂😂
you think this might be a marvel world?
THANK YOU
Bro this series is going off the rails😭 I’m so excited
“May Your Heart Be Your Guiding Key”
What an announcment to wake up too!!!!
So we have new Kh X on mobile, well done🤝
I thought this was just going to be mobile game bullshit but then SORA ON A SOFA
Phone game ? NANI ?
I thought I left this godforsaken series behind but here I am being hyped again for KH4. See you guys in 2026 when it finally gets released!
I CAN'T WAIT KH4!!!
Shoeless Sora… this is too cursed release the game NOWWWWWW
FOR GOD'S SAKE! WHERE ARE THE STEAM PORTS?!
Can’t follow this stupid story. Never buying another again.
HYPEEEE!!
I am so excited for KH vs 13
If we gotta wait a few more years and get more side games it will be worth the wait. KH 4 looks amazing.
I need to finish the first game now.
Is there a chance that cloud and sephiroth will appear in KH4?
KH 4!!! I can't wait to watch people play it on Youtube!!
Is this Hades at the end? 🤔
Oh my god an 3d kingdom hearts apl game
Kingdom Hearts IV is too big to be announced from nothing...
Please port Missing Link to consoles. I can't stand touch controls. T_T
I just woke up and saw this!!!!!!!!! Wow
Worlds I'd like to visit: Coco Moana Toy's Story (yes, again) Encanto Cars? Wreck it Ralph Zootopia
Am I the only one who lost it when _Strelitzia_ appeared in the KH4 trailer?
I just hope KH 4 wasn’t announced too early if the release date is 3 to 5 years from now.
I see Nomura is going hard for his Versus XIII ideas - which I like. I noticed the design and concepts are much darker this time around, as if KH is "growing up" so to speak. Hopefully PS5 will be available when the game comes out. Also, it was nice to see Strelitzia again.  However, can't say I'm thrilled about mobile game(s)... It's Nier ReIncarnation all over again. I understand mobile games are popular in Japan, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  The future of KH looks promising at least. Curious to see what new trailers will bring.  Edit: 6:28 Reminds me of Dark Lance in Nier Replicant
So they used Unreal Engine 5 for KHIV Sora look realistic not all cartoonyish.
I wish they would TRY to remake 358/2 Days and ReCoded for new systems..
I have a reason to live again, LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
KH needs to die before it gets more shity..er.
Kingdom hearts in real life bro confirmed. My mind is blown. This was a crazy 20th anniversary thank you so much. Nomura, square, Disney, sora, Donald, goofy, prodigyxcd, the gamers joint, hmk, Kingdomace, niorlilbomber, soralam1. We're blessed to be fans of this amazing phenomenon series.
Based off this first world having actual humans in a regular world they can now do Marvel and possibly Star Wars!!
His shoes are regular size!!!!
Yeah KH IV😍 ....what a nice way to wake up
So is it canon Sora lost... or..?
KH is very special to me. When KH3 came out, after waiting for so long I felt it was incomplete, story and gameplay wise. Hopefully with this installment Tetsuya Nomura can do all he had in mind.  Ps- Wasn't that voice at the end of the teaser trailer, Hades?
is KH4 running on the same engine of 3? it looks identical to when you visit the pirate of the caribbean themed level where everything graphically looks realistic though here it looks better... maybe reused assets from KH3?
KH4 letsssssss gooooooooooooooooooo
“Everything is connected”  Sadly have no interest in playing a 2D side-scroller version for kids as “the finale” of anything.   But W O W KH4 looks SO GOOF… GOOD*
Why when I promised myself never to play kingdom hearts again after my personal hate for kh3... WE GET KH4! And it looks good!?
Yes just yes
this was a shocker, did not expect Sora to be wearing NORMAL PEOPLE Shoes 😂
Well hopefully it won't suck ass like 3 did
I can see them adding Marvel/Star Wars properties into this easily with the new visual style.
See y'all in 10 years when IV actually releases
I really had to double check to see if this was a video I missed from April 1st😫😫
Wake up and see a new game play look for KH4 😱 and look even more beautiful 😭
KH4 ???!?! I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD BE ALIVE TO SEE IT
Where Yozora at
too bad we can't like a video twice, cuz I would've liked it 4 times
Was that Axle at the end?
THERES NO WAYYYYYYYY!!! IVE BEEN HAVING THESE WEIRD DREAMS LATELY AND THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THEM
LETS GOOOOO KH4
AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!! New kingdom hearts arc!!!! Oh my god!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩
😍🔥 yessssssss
I AM SO HYPE KHIV BABYYY! And damn does it look good. And Yoko just friggin hitting me in the feels again with her badass score.
can't wait for KH4 when it releases in 2030
see y’all on 2056 when KH IV drops
boring
HIS SHOES ARE SENSIBLE OMG
KH4; featuring more parkour and Attack On Titan style fights
My mind right now, :"OH MY GOD. OK this happening. Every body stay calm. Stay calm. Stay the Fuck calm!"
Oh it is great to be alive. This looks stunning, haven't screamed for a game trailer since quite a while
When will the KH series be on steam?
That phone game looks mad stiff but kingdom hearts 4 look amazing, my only problem is I like how cartoony kingdom hearts used to be, the more defined and real the graphics get, the more all the characters look straight up Japanese or like this trailer makes sora look more anime boy in real life than ever
The ride never ends
Let the wait begin... So when do you think we can expect KH4? I say at least 2025-2026.
YESYEYYSYSY YES THANK YOU THANK YOOOUUU KH 4 WOOOOO ✨✨🌟🌟👏🏾😭💙💙💙
OH MY GOD
I can't believe what I just saw incredible!
Time for more immature Sora, forced Disney worlds, a lack of FF characters, and an incoherent story. Honestly after the garbage pile of KH3, I’m not even excited.
Your turn Atlus where’s persona 6
I haven't been this hyped since the KH3 final trailer😭
Not just normal sized shoes and feet, but I'm hoping Sora is taller, because he doesn't look like he's grown much.  Otherwise I'm hyped, now I just need to get a PS5.
I’m really taken aback rn, when a photo of Sora I thought it was a joke after googling it and watching this video about it I’m still in disbelief that this is real, can’t wait to play this in 2024 lol.
Ok then
🤯😁
Got all this time to release 20th anniversary but cannot release kingdom hearts 4
Can we have the french version please ?
kh4 looks like shit with this photo realism
What I can’t believe is that Sora has a nicer apartment than mine!!!!
BRAIN IN 3D RENDERING! BRAIN IN 3D RENDERING! HELPPPPPPPPP!  And Strelitzia!!!! We finally see her!!! Oh man, Sora just straight away attacking the Heartless... Chronic Main Protagonist Illness for you. That animation and use of the Keyblade was _smooth_ !! This is so _HYPE_ !
*I cant wait to see Roxas New face !*
OH MY GOD ! ! ! !
WE DIDN'T GO TWENTY YEARS JUST TO FIND-OUT SORA DOESN'T HAVE MICKEY-MOUSE-SIZED HYPER-FETISH-FEET. WHERE'S MY DO-OVER?!
Wtf is happening? 😳
Yozoraaaaa!!
Yo the graphics look so cleannn 😫😫
Kingdom Hearts 4 !!! <3 Thanks you so much !!!!!
Yo his chucks aint goofy no more. We can actually see his feet and they fit the shoes proper.
that is an amazing Darkside. I think now since we're in a more realistic place, we can see what they look like in a more real world setting, cause that Darkside is ENORMOUS.
Maybe they should be faster. rather then giving us a kingdom hearts compilation that a bunch of fans could have made over and over again
Sora's looks grown asf in this trailer! I love it!
Haaaaaa i KH4 new story wohooo
the KH4 trailer is probably the coolest thing ive seen this decade
KH 4 was announced quicker than 3 was.
Can't lie. KH4 looks dope. But damn, they couldn't give my boy Sora some overly sized shoes? That was his thing!
I'm so glad we've moved onto a new arc.  I also thought we were done with the black coats. I want to set fire to the store selling them to all the KH villains.
Was that Hades at the end? Sounds like something I would’ve understood if the trailer was english
Hopefully kh4 won't take ten years to come out like kh3
Son of a bitch got normal shoes
who do you think the guy with Donald and goofy is
This man has normal clothes!😱
Thank you, Square, for keeping my love for KH alive!
I don't want to play two mobile games, Nomura.  At least dump them on Switch
Sora has the drill that will pierce the heavens!!!
This is gonna be tricky to play out the story, but I'm ready.
I'm taking a look at some of the spells being used, little trophy like icons that match key memories from characters like donald casting thunder spells and terra utilizing a physical attack skill. Then you have multiplayer sections- I think shown against the darkside in the keyblade graveyard. I don't know what Nomura is up to, but I know Sora is back in some regard- now how about the skyscraper then? Didn't expect the ios / android game, but it will look quite cool.   I did not expect quadratum to look the way it did in this trailer- no mention of the world ends with you at all. That giant heartless though looks new, as well as the abilities sora can still use in this world. Then the organization is back at it again, I wonder what happens when Sora leaves quadratum?
He has normal sized shoes finally
I wish the new main character wasn’t Sora tbh. His character has been written so poorly recently that I believe they’d be better off with a new protagonist. Sora can still make appearances and help in the story/gameplay. And I think you should be able to play as him, but he shouldn’t be the focus anymore. After the disaster that was KH3, I’m extremely concerned for KH4. The missing link game looks more intriguing to me. Seems like we may get to play as a CAC.
OMG! We finally see his feet! They aren't jumbo size after all.
KINGDOM HEARTS IV?!?!?!?¡? PLEASE DO IT PLEEEEEEEEAAAAAASE
I love Sora's modern-yet-still-fantasy new look
Though an early development stage footage, but already I'm liking how this is turning out. And those two go to Hades of all people for help? This journey has really made them crazy.
If there is a PC version releasing day and date with the console versions, I'll play the everlasting fuck out of it!
Guess I will keep waiting for a steam announcement ~.~
LETS FUCKING GO!!!!!!
I hope there’s till a good chunk that’s visiting Disney worlds lol
7:16  Looks like Hades would aid Goofy and Donald in finding Sora in KH4
Wow! Just wow! Kingdom Heart 4???
🙂
0:41 So... the Disney stuff in Dark Road is another Book of Prophecies/Datascape conjuration? 1:23 Reminds me of when Axel asked the same question as Roxas was leaving the Organization. So now, instead of fighting with cards or medals, we're fighting with amiibos. STRELITZIA!!! Epic.  Demon Darkside (or is that supposed to be the "Karma"?); Keyblade grappling, leaping through a collapsing building... Who is the playable character supposed to be?  He looks kind of like Sora, the situation command or whatever sigil is his crown, and he has the Kingdom Key, but looking at his face, he doesn't look the same.  Are we being introduced to a similar-but-different character like Roxas in II?  Is he an alternate version of Sora?
That stupid mobile game killed this franchise.
how?
I thought this was KH4 multiplayer 😅
Skip to 4:04 for second trailer.
😍😍😍😍😍
No lie. This's like ff15 fake trailer from E3 2013
SOO FUCKING HYPED
I’ll be watching on the sidelines. I dont have high hopes.
and now to wait 10 years for the game to release
That single blue flame. Could it be.  Sans Undertale?!?   Jk. But what if.
I demand Noctis as a party member. I DEMAND MORE FINAL FANTASY BRING CLOUD BACK. SOMETHING!!! THIS ENGINE LOOKS TOO GOOD NOT TO HAVE A FF CHARACTER IN IT
Is this my beloved Final Fantasy Versus XIII???
I not only watched my boy grow into a man but I grew along with him ❤️
This is what literally motivates me to keep going in life..
Oh my giddy aunt...KH 4 is coming!?
Sora looks more like a girl than ever before XD But I am simply struck of how beautiful this looks! Its whoa..now I really have to get a ps5 XD
KH4 looking wild and I'm loving it.
So the last voice should be Hades from the Hercules? I remember his flame always come with blue color. But turn red when he is angry.
Brah I hope they didn't snip this man's creativity again. Idk if I should be excited or upset to see Donald and Goofy at the end. I though we were gonna get the final fantasy we were promised 15 years ago.
KH4? I'll see everyone later when it comes out in 10 years using Unreal 15
I really hope they bring back the Final Fantasy characters
I thought we were gonna get a bunch of side games before 4
7:24 That's Hades, right?
They are going to milk this series and drag it out forever and still put important story law on temporary mobile games. This is not fun. This is tedious & Square has learnt nothing from the past 20 years. This series is never going to end. It will never have a satisfying conclusion. This is ridiculous. This is a cashgrab for consoomer's delight.
So hyped!
OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS REAL!!!
Maybe Donald will actually heal us now
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I woke up to a KH4 trailer! I thought it was a joke but OH MY GOD ITS REAL!!!!!
This is terrifying,, I’m surprised a lot of people are liking this. It’s feels like a whole different game. Am I going to have to play the whole FF series too?? I love the Disney aspects and the childlike wonder of the game. And now it seems like a dull grey world with sora as the only thing reminiscent of kingdom hearts. And his shoes are gone???!?!? But if the veteran players like it I guess it’s good.
I hope the combat ain’t over the top like kh3 . Take it back to kh2 will be perfect
August for Dark Road? That’s nearly a year delay 😂 I better know everything about Xehanort’s life man.
I'm going to listen to Dearly Beloved till Kingdom Hearts 4 comes out
Happy there’s a KH4 ! Disappointed it’s gonna play like KH3 …. Floaty floaty floaty🥲

This is giving me heavy Uncanny Valley vibes. Sora looks like a japanese cosplayer.
IM ALIVE NOW
SORA IS SPIDER MAN NOWWWW
I don't know why but after this video my interest toward KH became less I mean i don't even feel this is kingdom hearts anymore :/
Alright boys and girls I will see you all in like 3 to 4 years hopefully.
Seeing that KH4 was real was the best surprise to see in the morning ever!
Is it going to be out by the 30th anniversary? It looks interesting but I can’t let myself get excited for another KH game ever again. The wait between 2 and 3 was insane.
Sora kinda looking like Noctis 🔥👌
The real question is when will it come out.
I think I'll stick to 1 & 2. Not keen on that generic unreal engine look.
Sora will be in the MCU confirmed.
I am super hyped about KH4 but they really need to quit doing these danm mobile games, union cross was fun at first but its miroctranstions where of control at first , then it became super generous but it was so long and drawn out and the contant battles got repetitive and boring wich sucks cause it was one of the best and most important stories in this series. They messed up an opportunity to make an amazing KH MMO on console or switch. Missing link looks super good I just wish it would he on switch as well as moblie and please don't let it be full of mircotransactions like they did to Union Cross
Wow! It has been a while.
The last kingdom hearts felt incomplete and lacking . Hope they do a better job next time .
Never left to chance
Wow I was expecting the next console game to be a non-numbered game, but instead we're actually getting Kingdom Hearts 4! He'll yeah! Plus, Strelitzia is going to appear as well!!!!
Dude why did they make Sora look like a Japanese cosplayer. And the world looks way to gray and bland. Also I'm guessing that was hades at the end and Donald and Goofy are trying to see if he knows how to get Sora back to life.
Nice to see kh4 but really stop it with the mobile games please
YES! MY BOY IS IN SHIBUYA FIGHTING WEIRD DEMONS, YES!! AND HE HAS NORMAL SHOES! IMAGINE THE SMELL!
Dang!!! This is so exciting 🤩✨ Man, I need to start playing the KH games again so I can get caught up! 😮
I want to go outside and scream, this is fantastical! I'm so happy they're supporting the franchise like this instead of another long-term hiatus!!
What if Nomura is the Master of Masters
YOOOOO THIS IS CRAZYYYY
Weird. I thought this have a million+ views by now.
Nomura be like "I will have my FFversus13 game whether you LIKE IT OR NOT!!"
LETS GOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i cry so hard
Can't for kingdom hearts 4 in the next 6 years
plz make a global server. Had been missed the mobile kingdom heart for a few years already
Holy shiiiiit the graphics are fuckin amazing 👏 😍 🙌
Duuude I cannot wait to play this in 10 years!!!!!! 😅😂😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
KH4 looks incredible! How does this game already look significantly better than 3 in the visuals department!?  And tbh, I'm equally excited for Missing Link. Even if it's a mobile game, it actually looks like it's a proper translation of the real-time KH action, instead of a turn-based or active-timer battle like X and Dark Road.
Was getting really impatient and hungry for anything new from Kingdom Hearts, so I'm glad we finally have some news and some very exciting reveals. Missing Link and Kingdom Hearts 4 look incredible and if ML really is voiced, then all the better.  If any future mobile games look or sound like this one seems to instead of the last couple, then I'm all in. Curious who Donald and Goofy meet at the end of the trailer, why it scares them and just where they are.
YouTube Algorithm on point today.
FCKKKKKKKKKKK AAAAAAAAAA I AM SO EXCITED ABT THIS
How the hell is Strelizia alive?
YAY WE'RE GETTING A 4  OH I'M SO EXCITED
Did sora just use giga drill breaker???
This looks absolutely insane!!! I was not expecting to see this this morning!! Happy days!! We've all grown up with this game (mid teens to mid 30's here!) and I genuinely felt like a child at Christmas watching this trailer! It looks incredible!  Bring it on KH4!
Yoo wtf! KH4?!?! Nahhh!! Wtf!! This better redeem part 3 lol
KINGDOM HEARTS 4!!
wait wasnt that hades voiceactor? or am i tripping? I must be tripping cus they actually just showed footage for KH4 without having us to wait over 10 years.
Did Sora made a Giga Drill breaker ?! My boy as come a long way. 👆
Woke from a bad dream to get this to Brighten my day :).
Who the fuck are all the new characters too much for ppl who only play the main games
BEST BEWS I'VE HEARD ALL MORNING!!!!
MY BODY HAS NEVER BEEN SO READY
Will I get spoiled with the Re-Mind story if I watch this trailer?
Wait was that light at the end Hades?!
I AM SCREAMING ,IM TOO HYPE
Thos gonna be ffxv all over again
This all looks fucking awful...wtf
Enter the real world! my guess for PS5 only this time. Graphics almost match the FF7 remake! I can wait this out, even if it takes years, I'm loving what this next one will look like.
Will there be more microstansactions than chocobo gp?
That's great we're getting Kingdom Hearts IV but it better not be another 10 years because that'll be unacceptable. And if y'all don't release these Kingdom Hearts mobile games for Systems  I get Japan plays alot of mobile but the others don't it's stupid to make Missing Link on mobile when there are consoles users who want to play especially when story is tied to both the core games and all the spin off. Kinda disappointed really
Wow. Some anniversary. A conclusion to a mobile game no one plays, a new mobile game that's another blatant cash grab, and a trailer for a game that now looks like every other action JRPG. What a load.
I hope they make more Disney worlds.
Will Sora become trans intersex non-binary queer demisexual? Cuz otherwise I'm not sure if Disney will be happy with this.
OMG!!! IT HERE IT HERE!!!
Limited to specific regions? That's worrying.
NO WAY!!!!! KH4
And now 12 Years Later we can Play KH4 xD
It is a ways away, but still hyped.   Also kind of wishing Square would break away from the mobile scene. I know it's a growing market, but I am so not for it.
I'm over Kingdom Hearts.  KH4: Uh, no you fuckin aren't.
Portuguese-BR Location, Please...
OMG!!!!!!
I AM SO SO SO SO EXCITED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Think I'm gunna cry
Exciting stuff, but that KH4 trailer brings back memories of that early Final Fantasy XV trailer that was later revealed to be almost entirely CG. I'll believe it when I see it, but I really doubt that the final game is going to look that good.
What
Can’t wait to see what worlds KH4 has, looks amazing already 😍 also that choral version of Dearly Beloved is just ❤️❤️❤️ god I love this series
This would cinder your PS5 and scorch your XBOX Series X.  I can't wait to play this on PS7.
THE HERO WE NEED!!
Huh... Didn't expect that.
WW3
BEGGING for the addition of more TWEWY characters tbh
I can't be the ONLY one who's disappointed, right? Anyone else? Even a little? Please? To me, the best part of this trailer was the Dearly Beloved remix, seriously, that remix is godlike, but I can't be the only person who feels like that, right?
Sora looks gorgeous!! I can’t wait to see how Riku and Kairi look in this new world 🤩
Esa no me la esperaba
The mobile games ill watch a youtube lore video on and for kh4 im so mixed on whether i like <:(
You guys are too fast, im still struggling with KH1
KH4 looks like what people wanted for KH3 which is more of the final fantasy style and influence since most of us that started with KH1 have grown up and away from the Disney/Pixar stages of our lives.
After 20 years and we’ve finally seen Sora’s feet, hallelujah
OK KH4 hype aside... KH Missing Link looks dope. Like an upscaled polished version of Days
Yooooooo!
ugh I'm still vehemently against Mobile titles being absolutely integral to play to understand what happens in a mainline game.....
HOLY SHIT KH4 IS COMING OUT AND WERE GETTING A 3d FREE ROAM KH FOR IPHONE????!!!! BRUHHHHH
omg since there is no gummy ship they'r gonna focus on a single world that's gonna be awesome
This is so great. I will always want more Kingdom Hearts.
WAS THAT FUCKING HADES
Kingdom Hearts 4? Man, I'm still stuck on Limit Cut.  Also, Sora just looks wrong to me. Where's the pointy hair?
hope that it will aired soon, and donald and goofy is seen to be at the underworld try and find sora.
Why does Sora look like a recolor of Noctis lol
Missing Link not on the Switch? Lame.
Everyone says Sora looks like noctis, but the fits, shoes and hair always gave me tidus vibes
This is the best birthday present for a Kingdom Hearts fan. Thank you Nomura-san!!!
So we can all agree Sora's WELL beyond Keyblade Master, right? ALSO HE LOOKS GREAT! Though... Hades is going to be a big player, huh?
Omg the chills from watching this, I am super tired excited can’t wait to see king Mickey again 🥹🥹🥹and the rest of the gang….. Best news ever
We must Protect Sora at all costs! 🙏🏾🖤
This blew my mind. KH4 and Sora wearing shoes with a NORMAL size?! :O
I’m sorry I woke up to kingdom hearts 4? Am I dreaming rn someone pinch me
That sounds like Hades at the back… then again, he did say it was the afterlife.. so it made sense for Hades to play an important part in this.. I mean… blue flame, red flame? Come onnnnn it’s gotta be Hades XD
Man that is messed up in the best of ways! <3
LETS GOOOO!!!!!!!!!
This is 2013. You're watching a Final Fantasy Versus XIII trailer. Everything is fine.
I hope they dial back the Diseny stuff for Kingdom Hearts 4 My only complaint with 3 is that there was too much focus on Pixar/Disney and the main plot got pushed way back to the end. Hopefuly not this time.
Sora's evolution to becoming noctis
Kingdom Hearts 4!?
https://youtu.be/-SBuWV-NUi4
See you in 10 years ❤️
This is getting ridiculous
WE WIN
Yeah absolutely no shot that gonna be on the switch anytime soon😅
キリショー…？
The gameplay you see is using Unreal Engine 4, but the final version will be in Unreal Engine 5. This is some fantastic news!!
If I only think about how much this saga means to me I start shivering. I was almost 10 years old when I started,  now, at almost 24, I'm still here. I'll follow Sora everywhere, because this franchise saved my life, and it still does everyday.  Thanks Kingom Hearts, Thanks ❤️.
Kingdom Hearts 4 huh?  Please promise me there will also be some worlds based on older movies and not just the CGI films.  Not that I hate those but y'know.  Still at least some movies that could be covered like Jungle Book (original, thank you.).
I want the shoes Sora is wearing.  That Is something I thought I would never say.
What a way to wake up to a new looking Sora! This freakin trailer made me cry AHHHHH!!!!
7:18 I thought that was a will o wisp from Brave then the fire Bursts then we see hades. But rn, I'm so fucking hyped!!!!
Was that hades at the end?
When the hell is it gonna come out 2030
Am I going to have to play the KH3 DLC to understand what is happening in KH4?
No one's noticed how Nox Arterna is playing.
I really hope this wasn't announced too early like KH3 was and made us all wait six years
KINGDOM VERSUS XIII??
was that a drill? will it pierce the heavens?
Kingdom Hearts: The Bullshit Never Ends
GO DAMN WHY BRAIN KINDA 😳😳
Bruh kh is now photorealistic im crying
WHAT THE FUCK DID THEY DO TO SORA
Finally my boy got some normal shoes
What a great way to start off my new day! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Kingdom Hearts 4? I'll be  sure to have it memorized.
This was awesome! At least for me but..I kinda feel that Sora might be an "infinite adevnturer" meaning he can travel anywhere, whenever, as mentioned he has "endless options", he might never have a proper place/home, he can never stay forever in one place as the price for using the power of awakening (?) or whatever he had to do during KH3 to bring everyone back. He actually messed up the time and space and now he's body can or very own existence is lost in time and space hence giving him the ability to travel worlds but can never return or might be hard for him to return - most specially when that black hooded guy whoever he is said that leaving Quadratum doesn't mean he'll get to return to his original world.
HOLY SH*T HOLY F*CK
I have been born again in the cleansing flame of a new kickass Nomura trailer. We're feasting today.
This guy sleeps for 7 days and rushes off to fight a colossal heartless titan. Didn’t eat didn’t brush his teeth none of that
Amazing. Can't wait to see the upgrade on Unreal Engine 5.
KH 4 is CONFIRM!!!🤩 I’m si exited!! Sora is alive and there is the MOM! (Master of Master)🥷
O MY KINGDOM HEARTS IV is coming 😱😍 This grafic is so beautyfull 💙
These graphics are so good it’s making me anxious HAHA
I am just impressed that it didn't take 30 years, and 15 spin offs to announce this.
SORAAAA!
**AND SO!! THE WAIT FOR KINGDOM HEARTS 4!!!!!!** **BEGINS!!!**
Sora is looking more and more serious here than he was in KH 3 as his always more happy and goofy but now his more determined here.
Really big hopes and dreams but I'm very cautious after the way KH3 ended up
Guys I love this trailer but Im confused, is Sora older? Or its a canon redesing of the character, here he seems like 2 or 3 yeras older than in kh3
I got a weird feeling about all this with all that happened in those two years (the end of union X and the ryhtm game and now those weird
I guess the only way to find out where dead people go... IS TO ASK THE LORD OF THE UNDERWORLD HIMSELF!!!!
Can nomura stop making everything look like noctis? 😑 he's lost his touch.
Kingdom Hearts 4 that should have these worlds:  The Incredibles Moana Wreck-It Ralph A Bugs Life Brave Zootopia  Treasure Planet Ratatouille  The Proud Family  and much some possibilities
LETS GO!!!!
This is the most badass Darkside design ever
STRELITIZIA?! HOLY SHIT SHE'S ALIVE!!!
IT'S HAPPENING!! YEEEEEEESS!!!!
Honestly if its gonna be the same as KH3, I dont want it
I an so so so happy
MY DRILL IS THE ONE THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS !!!!
Kingdom hearts 3: Disney game Kingdom hearts 4: Square Enix game  Kingdom Hearts 5: Full on crossover  Kingdom Hearts 1: remake
Damn ost of kingdom H missing-link is soo good!
Not buying until we see more gameplay. You did this with 3 it’s not happening again.
I AM SCREAMING INFINITE TIMES 😭😭😭
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Will comment this again lol, I can't wait for KH 3.14159 and a Half Day Redux Re:InvigoRate by Sleep while Dreaming a Draft Destiny version. Jokes aside, will be keeping an eye and attention for this.
This is a half joke but I can’t wait to play in in 5-7 years 🤣🤣🤣😭
So hyped for KH4 but I just need the story to actually be decent and coherent. See you all in 10 years...
lol each one looks like shit
Stop Nomura pls, throw him away from the brand
Hell yeah the final fantasy versus 13! Lol just kidding xD
drive forms might be back and that's hype
Please tell me that was not sora…. It looks NOTHING like him
Well hopefully this one relaeases with at least half the stuff it shows off instead of missing majority of it.
you know? after the shit that they pulled at KH 3, I really can't be hyped anymore. 20 years of essentially blue balling it's fans just made me hate KH, even though I was a huge fan once.
I’m really excited. Even though I’m not the biggest KH fan, I’m really excited.
Kh4 coming in 2030
Woke up with Covid, got the KH4 trailer…. Is any of this for real… or not?
LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
I gona cry ! When is it ?!
FINALLY KH4 HAS NOW BEEN REVEALED!!I gotta say, Sora looks really cool and great to see Donald and Goofy at the last part of the trailer, also can't wait to see how Riku, Kairi and the others look like. This makes me happy!
So within the next 5 years hopefully🙏
Turn upppoppp, see y’all in 2030 for kh4 😅😅😅😅🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I really REALLY want this game to be good. I love KH
Can’t wait for the release of KH4 in 2030
OMG KH4?! WE WILL NOT WAITING A LOTS OF YEARS?! THIS IS A MIRACLE BRO
After looking at KH4 imma definitely need to get a PS4 (assuming it does come to PS4) bc all i have is a switch and theres no way it can run that,So i guess this means imma have to get a PS4...
Please don't let KH4 really look like this...
KINGDOM HEARTS 4 BABY YES!!!
Kingdom hearts IV release date 8/9/2030
FINALY! I've been waiting for Union Cross to have an update!
This game is gonna be trash just like KH3
Sora what happened to you
5:05 STRELITZIA is ma gurl, ya diggg. 😍🥰🤣 Fall in line, behind me boyzz lmao
WE GOT KH4!!!
who had thought that we dont have to wait for kh4 a decade. i hope it will lead the story of sora to a nice end.
AAAAAH HE HAS A GRAPPLE!!!
Coming 2053
Legit surprised by KH 4's announcement! It looks like the long gap between 2 and 3 is not happening again 😁
I was like dam more mobile games... but the final announcement got me hyped
DONALD N GOOFY TRYNA ASK HADES FOR HELP TO BRING BACK SORA >>>>
That kingdom hearts 4 trailer blew me away, but I’m trying to keep my hype in check. I learned from kh3 not to make my expectations too high. Still enjoyed that game but would have even more if i kept my expectations in check. I can’t wait to get more info, this looks incredible.
Who's is at the end ?
I can't wait to play this in 10 years
Omg 😍😍
I feel like a nuclear thermal explosion went off inside me just by seeing this.
Kingdom Hearts Versus XIII 👌
Okay now I need to search for a PS5. Wish me luck.
Yaaaaawn
Started my KH journey since i was 17 , i am now 30 ….Thank you for the core memories 🥺💕
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Imagine if that was Hades at the end, making sure they don’t mess with the afterlife too much
It’d been to long…. I wonder if I still have the power to summon a keyblade still.  *raises hand to the air*  *keyblade forms*….  Heh. I guess my time isn’t up, as a Veteran KH player. No matter how “terrible” the game is, we true KH players will always appreciate the work and time you put into this complex story.  Keyblade wielders! Raise your blade up and form a connection!   We must believe <3!
Been out of touch with games for about like a year or two. Honestly thought I wouldn't feel anything with these releases, but I'm so damn happy that I'm tearing up that we're getting a KH4.
That waterfall scene looks like where Luna Freya's mother was killed.
Look at my boy :,) he’s growing up LETS GET IT!!!!
WHAT. HOLY. WHATTTTTTTT
Twewy 2.0 remix final mix 2 the game
Today was a really sad day for me But this Little YouTube Pop-up Made my year IM SO HYPED
Some people there are in winter but the others still didn't catch up.
My inner 10 year old boy is smiling after watching this. I’ll never forget staying up playing KH1 on our pull out couch bed. Such a special franchise for me.
Its a shame we havent seen anything for Kairi at this event
KH4 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Fans: Kingdom Hearts 3 needed more Final Fantasy characters Sora: Look at me I'm the Final Fantasy character now
Genuinely thought it was a late april fool when I saw KH4 trending with pictures from this...
Trailer for KHIV starts at 4:07… Oh Nomura
Can't wait! Hopefully we don't wait another 14+ years again for the game. But I did like all the in between games!
Honestly I thought it was over at 3
WTF have I just witnessed on my work break 😮😯😲 sooo epic can't wait 😁😁
Never-ending-series ...
Yoo my body sora has gotten more drip now
I’m legit crying rn, I thought for sure 3 was gonna kill this beautiful franchise.  So excited for this next chapter in my favorite story!!!
WOKE UP TO THE BEST NEWS EVER!!! KINGDOM HEARTS IV!!!!!!!!!!!
AOH BOY, I CANT WAIT O MY PC EXPLODE BY PLAYING KH4
I hope the flaws from KH3 are fixed in this one. One main one being that we don’t have the whole game following the pattern of “plays for 5 minutes, forced to watch a half hour cutscene about people we don’t even care about. Play for another 10 minutes, forced to watch a forty minute cutscene we don’t care about. Etc”
Goddamn, Nomura sure taught me a lesson about keeping my expectations low; DON'T DO IT! ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN!
See I’m glad they showed a kh4 trailer or else I don’t think anyone would care about a phone game that’s using kingdom hearts 3 assets. So hyped for kingdom hearts 4 though!
オー！マァイ！ギッッ！！
Is KH4 about to have multiple play paths and endings?
Hype levels rising!!!
I’m so confused. Why is sore in a modern day world?
Dude i am crying right now and they are making the fourth kingdom hearts i cant wait to buy it because it looks so good Nomura You're The Best!!!!😭🔥✨
KH4 honestly look pretty damn amazing here. I just hope they make the combat more fluent like in KH2.
I hope kh4 is better unlike kh3
NOT ANOTHER MOBAGE NOOOOO
hope KH4 game come out before 2025 though lol
OK this has got to be the biggest joke ever..... kh3 was the last one..... ever...... that was told to us...... now, we have to wait in agony for...... kh4 which looks even better than kh3.    Wow..... just wow.
I hope to God that we will not have to wait 7 years to play this, as there is no release date I'd say 2024, but no matter how much time I have to wait I will be there for it, another thing I hope for is that it releases on pc simultaneously with consoles, because no way I can buy a ps5 in the near future
He’s been in that world for seven days we all know the dream he was having he was dreaming of smash bros
Gameplay on KHIV looks crazy
Greatest birthday gift
A star walks into a black hole but doesn't seen phased.The black hole then turns to the star and says, "I don't think you understand the gravity of this situation."
4:54 Sora's hair is fashioned a lot like Yozora's. Sora is Yozora's true form.
*wheezing* SORA IS BECOMING FINAL FANTASY BOIS, I EXPECT AND DIDN'T EXPECT IT
This was not on my 2022 bingo card but I am hype!
I did not see this one coming. Hope to see more updates soon.
All aboard the hype train! \o/  What a pleasant surprise, thank you Square Enix :D.
Am i the only one that's... weirded out by Sora new design? Heck, before he whipped out his keyblade, i thought it was Yozora or a new character! I always thought Sora of a mixture between Final Fantasy and Disney, but now it looks like he went 100% Final Fantasy. The world looks amazing, but i really hope it's not the only world of the game, even if it's massive. Also, that's definitely Darkside and i hope the Heartless also get a different design this game. Don't get me wrong, im excited we're getting KH4 and the game looks visually appealing for a first trailer, but we also have to remember that KH3 first trailer was also visually appealing, so we can't expect the game to be 100% like this. P.S: Why do i think the final figure at the end was Hades?
IM SO HAPPY- IM LITERALLY SHAKING MY EYES ARE WATERING- OMG IM SO HAPPY RN I CANT WAIT! I CAN'T WAIT!
I still have no idea what the story of this game is
THE MAGIC OF FRIENDSHIP IS THE KEY!!!!!! I’m so happy that KH4 is finally coming soon!  Happy 20th anniversary Kingdom Hearts!
Can we get the japanese voice this time and not the bad english one ?
Absolutely beautiful 🤩🤩🤩🤩
KH in a hyperealistic world....  Wait and see I guess.  SE your track record so far is pretty abysmal, please don't fuck up KH.
HOLY SHIT!!!!
Incredible.
This isn't a dream, right? RIGHT?
Ooh... Sora looking more modern mature and taller!~ the years really do catch up huh~ if Riku ever comes he might be like 20s already~
So dark ifrit claimed the red regalia and cute noctis is getting it back 😎
Please that this don't take 10 years to release! 🙏
OMG....... OMG
My boi is finally all grown up! It brings a smile to my face.
WHAT THE HELL GURREN LAGANN???
I was about to sleep and I see this
this filled my Heart...WITH LIGHT!!!  Happy Anniversary, Kingdom Hearts!!!   PS: Is that girl Strelitzia?
See yall in 10 years
I just shit my whole organs out. Bravo!
I can't belive we're getting KH4 with out at least 3 inbetweeney games of separate consoles LOL!! WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE YOS!!
Nomura said "I will have by protagonist run through a building during a boss fight!!!"
Oh goody! More convoluted plot lines!
So this afterlife sora is in is supposedly Square Enix? The world Sora was in before was basically a world full of the disney worlds. If my theory is right you'll likely see FF15, FF10, FF7, FF13, The World Ends with you and maybe FF9? It's just a theory but have you ever wondered where some of these Final Fantasy characters disappeared too? If Wakka, Tidus died after KH1, Seifer is mentioned in KH3 to have gone on a "Warrior's Journey" by people in the town, Zack is hinted to have died after BBS, Auron was already dead but Hades just took his soul we don't know what happened after that. What if this isn't the only afterlife place you see as Sora you can also travel to Zanarkand and Besaid, Midgar (Maybe I think Hollow Bastion is supposedly suppose to be a reference to Midgar), Cocoon from FF13, and I haven't played FF8 or 9 as of yet (or 6) so I don't know if those would make sense, however this is a modern world like Zanarkand, like Midgar, like Cocoon and it is obviously Insomnia Sora is in.  It's only a theory but if they did that it'd not only make sense as all of the Final Fantasy characters homes dis appeared (unless you wanna say Destiny Island is Besaid but come on No) and they have a serious problem with just disappearing these aren't like the disney characters that side back and just watch most of the FF characters are fighting and can or have died out there. Just my take would be cool, also KH4 BABY LETS GO
Oh boy cant wait when its out in 2056
Sora can use a Giga Drill Break now!? In all seriousness the keyblade chain transformation and powers look so cool
2040 release date !
Not sure how I feel about the direction of the series at this point. I'm glad other people are excited though.
Wow can't wait to play this in 2080!
My only hope is that KH4 is NOT a PS5-exclusive game
THIS IS THE BEST THING TO WAKE UP TOO WTF
My gosh! I was definitely not expecting Kingdom Hearts 4 to be announced, and it looks so amazing! This is by far the best looking game in the series and I’m already ecstatic about how the combat looks. Can’t wait to play it - in probably five to six years given Square’s track record
First Sora in super smash bros ultimate and then the twentieth anniversary event concluding with Kingdom Hearts IV within six months. *IT'S TOO MUCH*
I was not ready for this!!! They turnt this up crazy ! 🔥🔥📶
6:24 GIGA DRILL BREAKUUU!!
My fellow keyblade wielders all over this world.....UNITE!!!!
There's a Final Fantasy versus 13 vibes in that kingdom hearts trailer.
KH4!! THIS ISNT A JOKE!! MY HEART !
Who is that at the end with the flames?
Donald and Goofy ahww yeahhhh
So, this is what it feels like to be a KH fan and learn of a new game…. I LOVE IT!!!!!
LET'S GOOOOO
i hope goofy is still around
Who is hyped for Squeenix's  Woke Hearts 4? Because I'm not.  and I have all the older games.
I hope KH4 doesn't take 13 years after the previous game to release like KH3 did. It's looking great so far though!
HOORAY! So hyped! KH4 looks stunning! So amazing! And Missing Link too! Hopefully it comes to pc since I don't think my phone can handle it. But I'll cross that bridge when it comes to it.   Dark Road in August. Okay. First time playing. Eager to do so!  And hey. I just wanted to send a message to all you who are developing KHIV, take your time. Don't rush things. I can wait. Hype!
After the wackness that was KH3 the only way I can be hype for anything KH is if they  bring back og ff characters again. (yuffie, squall, aerith, X-2 friaries, etc...)
all these games can not wait for all this lore
NO ONE WAS EXPECTING THIS AT ALL
I’ve been a KH fan for many years now and I have not been able to make any of this new stuff makes sense. With sora going to the real world and all that is just so confusing
WHAAAAT ?! <3
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
Yesssssss
I'm crying right now. Thank you ❤️
Wow! This is so amazing, the trailer blowing my mind. So really exciting!😃😃
Don't get so excited.  We're  probably gonna have to wait another 15 years for it.
I want to see zootpoia and cars
Kinda don't like how Sora looks de-aged, but damn that alpha shit looks good.
So much info... ALSO MY BABY STRELITZIA OMG!!! Also the new mobile game looks lit. Also Also Just... Dhudhdbdu
Wooowwwww!!!!! ♡♡♡
WE ARE NOW ENTERING KINGDOM HEARTS SHIPPUDEN!!!! 😱🤯
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
KH4? Well, I guess I'll see you all again in 14+ years when it's actually out.
Wthhhh so realistic sora!! Gahhh perfect way to wake up lol
Please not more of the cinematic and floaty kh3 combat, i could feel it in my bones just from an action sequence...
Dude what the!!!!!!!!
So Sora Versus 13 Confirmed?
Please use marvel and stars wars ip in KH 4 don't be stupid and not use Thanos and Vaders at your disposal Disney and square
And then we wait for 5 years for kh4 to come out to be released on the ps5
😱😱😱😱😱 it looks so awesome
bello
The way Sora got up to that giant heartless with the parkour...was *CLEAN* And *SIMPLE* 🔥  Edit : Had to add in the "Simple" to make it official lol
Kingdom Hearts is Final Fantasy now:
I just….please make this story driven like the first 2 we’re. 3 was such a huge let down. Focus on kingdom hearts this time please and not disney attractions 🥺
I need to know Quadratum is a spiritual successor to FF versus 13 universe, so I wonder how much of Nomuras concepts for that game is gonna be seen in KH4.
hell yea!
Hello I will be spamming the replay button hope you don't mind :))))
That music tho
MoM really said "if you ain't happy, just isekai away"
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!
I think… at 3:34 we see a Cloud statue being summoned and it looks like the character executed an attack based on Cloud?
ma che è sta cacata
One can only dream that they use the Multiverse of Madness to introduce the MCU into Kingdom Hearts. Which could be a possibility they are introducing "realistic" worlds into the game.  It may never happen; but we can only hope. 😅
That boss fight reminds me of that early FF XV gameplay trailer with Noctis running through the city and then fighting Leviathan. It looked too good to be the actual gameplay and then in the final product it was nothing like the trailer. Hopefully that won't be the case here
Great! now we only have to wait 15 years.
Ffs, mobile garbage and probably another 10 year wait
I have this feeling: Quadratum in a world in another reality and KH is famous about Disney worlds, would be great add worlds that are Disney-acquired (Marvel, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Avatar, Simpsons, etc.), but maybe I'm dreaming
Unversed zipper on "MoM" coat!?!
Nomura, I'm tired
TAKE. MY. WALLET!!! I MUST HAVE THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS!!!
"If you escape this world dont expect to return to the one you came from"  Could be a subtle hint at another game with mainly square enix-worlds, which makes me very happy. After all what the devs had to endure (compared to the quality of the worlds) during KH3s disney world production, switching to square enix worlds was the most logical thing to do.
How many years will it take for the game 3 ,4 or 5 years
Sora has the drip! Square Enix, when are we getting the Kingdom Hearts Clothing Line? I mean, you all have shown that Nomura and his team can design some great stuff.
Finally kingdom hearts 4 and it's wonderful😁
You’ve been asleep for seven days. “Yeah, I had this crazy dream where I was fighting a plumber who could shoot fire from his hands, and a talking blue hedgehog.”
aaaaaaaaaaaaaa sora tá vivo😍😍😍😍
Yesss, Strelitzia! 💖
Dos they recast Goofy? His Japanese VA died last year...
This is further from the point then KH3. Please, Disney, Square, stop enhancing graphics instead of story  😥 Such a fun series
I was not a fan of KH3 but my god this looks stunning
So NOW they start to number those Games "correctly"? Whatever :P  Also why so many Phone Games? Just release them on Switch. Would be better,
Celebrating my birthday today! this is an awesome present!  Thank you square & Disney!
Is that sora 😮???  This is the NEXT LEVEL!!!
hopefully its not garbage like kh3
IT'S TIME!!!!! 😆😆😆😆
HOLY SHIT
So... No Kingdom Hearts on Steam?
Awesome!  Too bad for gamers that dont know KH Union X story. I hope there will be much more final fantasy in KH4, especially from a fantasy based on reality.
Ok kh4, see ya in 10 years
not another push triangle to finishing.. pls
FINALLY!!!! CONFIRMATION!!!! I'M SO EXCITED!!!
does this mean no Kingdom Karts
I’ll wait another 15 years for this
When you walk away
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Let's go!!!!!
While Sora is stuck in Quad. Donald and Goofy visit the underworld, seeking for help from an old friend with blue hair 😂
Dude Sora looks so sick! his new design might be up there with his KH2 design.
If it's in the real world, it would be interesting to see if they'd incorporate more realistic artstyle crossovers, like FFXV, or heck, the MCU and Star Wars.
OMGGGGGGG
Stop it. You guys made my inner child cry, I can’t believe I get to see KH4 so soon after 3, I never thought after waiting 10-12 years for 3 I’d get to see 4!!!!!
Bro I'm crying rn holy shit
See you in 2032 !
Now we wait 20 years for KH 4
I can't wait to have  play the 2 mobile games to understand half of what is going on by 4
I have already watched the KHIV segment several times & each time I just get more hyped!
7:17 Hades is that you ?
I’m in love with this! I just imagine a mix of persona with kingdom hearts! Imagine sora living daily life having to say the city from heartless AND having to find a way home
help work real "Unreal engine 5" Epic games > Kingdom heart 4 (2023 & 2024) . my power history 100% future.  Kingdom heart 4 : Epic games , Xbox , PS5 , future Nintendo switch Thank you . work UE 5
WHAT
I trust the vision.
When I see Strelitzia my mind screams:   WHAT ARE YOU UP TO NOW NOMURA?!!
Kingdom Hearts 4 looks amazing!
I'm not crying, you're crying! We're crying together! Excuse me, why does this trailer for Kingdom Hearts 4 look like that first trailer for Final Fantasy 15?!?!? And Donald and Goofy are just, "Where the freak is my kid?!?!"
That is some very ambitious upgrade for KH4 I really hope the final product looks as good as that preview or better. Hopefully we won't have to wait like we did for KH3 though lol. (But it would be worth it for that kind of polish)
The beginning at 4:37 sounds exactly like Somnus from FFXV.
I just know the music finna hit different in 4
May your heart be your guiding key..
YO, kingdom hearts never cased to amazed me. I'm also excited for the announcement for kh4. The new style for sora look really amazing and the clip of the gameplay for the game is smooth ⭐❤️👑
LETS F GOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Bro Life has meaning once again! The journey to Kingdom Hearts has started in the name of Kingdom Hearts 4!
Time to rise again, Justapancake. Your people need you once more!
So 2 money-grubbing mobile games and promises for a new game in the future. Given how the first kh3 reveal trailer aired in 2013 I'm not gonna get my hopes up for this.
I'm seeing it and still can't believe it🥺🥺
♥️
3 killed the series so hard, hopefully 4 will make it right
Dude sora is all grown up
finally a realistic KH phone game 🥺 So excited for KH4!💖
FINALLY AFTER FOUR YEARS OF HARD WORK AND WAITING...THE LONG WAITED GAME KINGDOM HEARTS 4 IS HERE!!!!!! YASSSSSSSSSSSS "let me face let me face let me face my fears"  *keeps singing~~*
The musics for KH4 are still kicking ! Thank you Yoko Shimomura !
It took 20 years to actually know that Sora has normal feet. Finally left the clown shoes at home yall.
Omg Kingdom Hearts 4 😭🤩
Man I hope they improve the NPCs because they look plastic as fuck. Sora and Darkside look awesome though.
I'm not as hyped for this as I should be.
Sora looks more realistic then before
I just hope the new look is for the new world. And that he will have a more cartoon look for the kh original world
See you in 10 years everyone
Amazing 🥰🥰🥰
meh, kh3 was a big disappointment, do not pre order. and without localization, not buying at all
Was that Hades in the end?
You would think they learned that publishing the story on different platforms isnt the right way to go, but nope. Still more bloat to understand the story.
So Hades is coming back? Hmm...  Honestly my personal hope/crack fanfic idea is for Joshua to show up in the underworld or Quadratum. That would be dream as a KH fan and TWEWY fan!  Also we now have a cgi model for Strelizia and Brain, maybe we'll finally get Back Cover X part 2!!!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Man I thought we were gonna get like 3 remakes, 12 spin-offs and 50 prequels before we got to this point.
idk how to feel about it tbh
WHAT Kingdom Hearts 4 YYYYYYYAAAAASSSSSSS I am DEFINITELY HYPED for this and when are they gonna do Kingdom Hearts Nintendo Switch without the cloud version👑🖤👑🖤👑🖤👑🖤👑🖤👑🖤👑🖤👑🖤👑🖤👑🖤👑🖤👑🖤👑🖤👑🖤👑🖤👑🖤👑💖👑💖👑💖👑💖👑💖
NO FUCKING WAYYYY KH4?????
Please don’t make us wait 14 years! I am so excited that I’m crying
Please have porter Robinson help make the main song!
This is insane. So stoked for KH4!
Someone please make a Smash Bros Mod that has KH4 Sora!
I don't know why but Sora having normal sized shoes is the absolute weirdest thing I've seen in KH so far  And that's saying a *lot*
KH4 LFG
I just can't believe they've announced KHIV without doing a bunch of random filler games. I'M HAPPY but i'm surprised
I'm so happy my stalker is alive. I was so sad and mad when she was killed. Strelitzia, my heart...
So what is Missing Link? Didnt exactly understand from the trailer. Is it like a multiplayer KH game?
What the fuck I didn’t expect a kingdom hearts 4 for atleast another ten years
KH4 looks so good!😭🔥
Sora finally lost all his baby fat and bby looks like a mini Cloud~ I'm so hyped for Kingdom Hearts 4.
I do hope it doesn’t repeat the mistake of KH3 over advertising. It does look quite amazing. It’s like the Final Fantasy XIII: Versus that we never had.
I hope these games have Apple TV support because I can’t play these in my little phone screen
Holy crap holy crap holy crap
I am not sure if I like this.
Sora definitely 18 now 😂
This series has really shown how much hard work has gone into this series, and this gets even better when you learn it's the English voice of Sora and Vanitas's birthday (Haley Joel Osment) while being the day after the birthday of the voice of Roxas and Ventus (Jesse Mccartney). Can't wait to see what the future holds for a series near and dear to my heart 😁🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉
О дааа!
Adventure awaits us!!!!!!!!
Idk...The footage seemed very uncanny-ish, Kh 3 perfected the disney x FF look without compromising either styles, The new style "Realism" doesn't look 😬 good enough...Like they already dabbled in that style in the Pirates of the carribean and it worked wonders. Hopefully the footage is just a super early development footage (As said in the vid) and not actually reflective of what the game is gonna look like at official launch with minor filters to hide the uncanny feel.
I want Nomura as a playable character
Kingdom Hearts IV! THIS IS NOT A DRILL!
yes! yes! yes! thank you! i'm so hyped rn 😃
5:13 many years later I can finally confirm Sora doesn’t have big feet
Looking forward to 2030 release . And for the love of god have the obvious MMORPG you are making for PC as well as Phones .
PS5 only? I do'nt have ps5... PS4 or Steam pleaseeeeee!!!!!!!!
I can believe it but I can’t believe it
Dear Nomura, PLEASE STOP MAKING THE MOBILE GAMES CENTRAL TO THE STORY OF KH Sincerely, everyone.
Soooo we dont have to wait a decade and a half for it again?   Good no more Spin offs then  Its finally happening
Now THAT is a classic SE trailer for the books. Versus XIII is reborn? I'm all for it!  I hope KH4 is a lot more contained within Quadratum and still make an awesome story out of it.
So… kH4 in about… a decade or so?
GENUINELY SO EXCITED MAN.
I AM LOSING MY MIND
KINGDOM HEARTS 4!!!!
I wanna cry. Hopefully I won’t have to wait 5 years. But only hint who Donald and goofy were looking for? Blue flame…
All i want is a level based on the boiling isles and I'll be happy
I wonder if Realistic, Final Fantasy XV looking Sora will only be for the Yozora world.
It’s crazy that’s the Sora from kh 1.. they grow up so quick I’m hyped
who are the one at the end? that talks to dolan and gooby?
the new font looks so uglyy 😭 i hope its not a permanent change...
Kept my expectations low and Nomura said "fuck that noise!"
Reserving my spot here before all the overseas people wake up and see it.
Kingdom Hearts 4 will never be on switch, unless it is a cloud version, which will suck ass.
Given, its only a trailer, but from the looks of it, they finally cut the ties with the original concept completely. Kingdom Hearts used to be a mash up between Final Fantasy and Disney, now it looks like its own completely unique thing (with a cameo or two). The problem is, in the past, the further they went from the initial concept, the worse the games have gotten... so take that as you will.
Im gonna splooge
wooo!!! now I can wait another 7 years before the game is finished!!
Yes yess YESSSS
i am so pumped for Kingdom Hearts IV
dang Sora looks like Noctis
LMAO NOMURA STILL SALTY ABOUT FF VERSUS 13 HE JUST DECIDED TO MAKE OBE AND NAME IT KH 4 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
SORA LOOKS SO CUTE OML
Safe to say that now elements of both The World Ends with You and Kingdom Hearts has now been blurred.
We lived to see Kingdom Hearts 4
Do you have so many brazilian fans, please give us subtitles or voices in portuguese-br. include us on the party
I'm ready for 20 more years of Kingdom Hearts. ♥️ I was having a shitty day and this trailer totally changed that.
OMGJIGDSHIGFJJ YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
The new game looks very interesting. I can't wait to see what it's all about.
I’m super duper excited about this for years I’ve always wanted to play the kingdom hearts franchise but I never ever did my older brother on the other hand has both one and two growing up and now since the first three games and third games dlc are available for the switch I can finally play them might get them as a early birthday present for myself and I have played the mobile game before on some of my older smartphone cellphones and I just redownloaded the mobile game now to start from scratch again so I’m very very excited and I hope four sells well like the first three and I hope In the fourth one we get newer Disney worlds and newer characters as well maybe a raya and the last dragon world exactly just a thought everyone 😊😇🧡💛
Okay im paying attention
Did Hades scare goofy and Donald at the end? I wonder if they can persuade James Woods to reprise the role for the English dub
KH4?! I was not expecting that at all when I woke up this morning! 😱
I can't wait for Kingdom Hearts 4🤩
🤯I'm I Dreaming !?🤯 This Is Real Right ?
Was greatly disappointed by KH3, and after being excited by this trailer I’m worried about KH4. Hopefully, Square Enix doesn’t ruin this game.
why i've dislike that: 2/3 mobile games, that nobody asked for
AAAAAAAAAAHGUUUUUH??!!!
Currently in development; We meet again.
"get real"
6:29 GIGA DRILL BREAK!!!!!! 😆
Thats gotta be hades at the end right, kinda a shame it wasnt in English coz it would have been super obvious lol
Wait a second. Is that...IS THAT STRELITZIA? 😲😲😲🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Hopefully it's not a massive disappointment like 3 was
Did anyone else AT ALL notice STRELITZIA!?!?
OH MY GOD KINGDOM HEARTS 4 LETS MFING GO!!!!!!!
is this ue5
So happy for this but I expected a Steam release for the older games
KINGDOM HEARTS 4! FINALLY. I hope we'll see Noctis there :З
welp, back to watching this trailer on repeat for the next 5 years
Can't wait to see how this one takes *10 years of development hell* like the last one   God, Nomura is a hack
7:16 That has to be Hades.
YOOOOO
The new kh4 graphics could imply that we could be dealing with the worlds of the more recent Final Fantasy games as well; 7 remake, 13, and 15. Also, notice how Yen and Ansem called the the universe the “world of fiction” in kh3. What’s another word for fiction? Fantasy! So I’m expecting Final Fantasy to play a stronger role this time.
PLEASE BE ON UNREAL ENGINE 5
Jesus oh my God 😱
PLS DO GERMAN VOICES AGAIN Q_Q
So it looks like Donald and goofy are looking for sora I’m the underworld to see where his heart/soul could be and hades probably knows
W O A W H A T
New head canon, Sora's mom is Rinoa and Leon who was trapped in Traverse Town since Sora's birth is his dad and knew instantly that Sora was his son which also explains why their names are similar.  Also Squall changed his name to Leon because Sora knew his dad's name.  All because Sora looks like squall does at the beginning of FF8.
Can't wait to play KH4 in 2050!
First sora gets welcomed into SSB now we’re getting a new KH game 😩blessed to be alive 💯
There will never be a day that I am not hyped for more kingdom hearts!!!! KH4 looks so sick already!!! Can't wait to see how it changes and evolves during development!
podemos hablar de lo raro que se ve sora y el número 4 del logo ??
He looks more and more like the noctis, the king we never have but nead <3
... Why does the gameplay look like the literal first trailer for Final Fantasy XV?... (Back when it was called VsXIII)
Ok, now I must buy a PS5
SIIIIIIIIIIII SSIIIIIIIAIIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSAAA
Disney's definitely going to include their new Marvel franchise.
I wonder what "THE LOST MASTERS ARC" gonna be? Will the 5 Foretellers, MoM, and Luxu a.k.a "Freakin" XIGBAR will be the main antagonists of the series? The "7 Black Pieces" at the KH3 epilogue will be revealed soon. LUXU as XIGBAR still gives me goosebumps.  I'm excited for this new installment. #KH4
And of course we get another mobile game that you can bet will have important plot points. Did they not learn why this is bad storytelling when they made Union X?
The avengers better be in kingdom hearts 4 lmfaoo
I would have never expected something this soon!
So excited!! But while KH4 graphics look great, they don't give me KH feels at all. Like if it isn't just for that world, I think it's going to look weird when mixed with Disney characters. I'm excited for the game, but miss the old art style.
Best. 4:05
Cant wait to see the 358/2 days group be in this ff art style.
KH 4!!!!!!!!!!!
Why does the music sound so generic for the KH4 trailer though
This reminds me of FF Versus XIII/ FFXV. Loving the realistic look but I the Disney characters will look kind of out of place.
Well no Disney Worlds for this game...
*24 year old me crying* 20th😩😩😩 we grew up together Sora!! You’re doing great sweetie!!!
when u cant design the enemies: make it all black and uninsteresting design.
Kingdom hearts 1 and 2 were the first games i finished when i was a kid, thank you... <3
KH4!!!!!! AHHHH
so.. Sora just arrived.. in Japan?
THAT WAS A GIGA DRILL BREAKER!!!
Kingdomhearts 4 sora dead
I still remember this first time I saw the commercial for KH1...I was 12-13 and absolutely captivated!! I'm almost 30 now and still captivated by KH!! 💜🗝
Can't wait to play this in about 6-8 years!
Man we aren’t even gonna get this shit til like 2024 to 2026
OH MY GOSH THIS IS HAPPENING
Kingdom Hearts Done Took A Step Outa The Disney World Into REALITY Now.  As *A KINGDOM HEARTS FAN* , I'm Glad They Are STILL Continuing The Storyline.   My Advice For All The Newcomers , PLEASE Play At *LEAST* Kingdom Hearts 1 & 2 Because I Promise You , This Game Is More Than Just Disney Charcaters And A Kid With A Keyblade.  🙏
Excited to have Korone reprise her role as Goofy
Ugh
Sora is a brown-haired Noctis
Kingdom Hearts final fantasy????? 🧐🧐🧐😳😳😳😳
But cannot say I'm siked about the missing link kh game being on Mobile devices as there is a extreme opportunity to put it on switch but so be it I'll still play it. I'll Also play Dark road because kh story is best
OH SHIT BRO! LIFE IS WORTH IT AGAIN ! LOOKIT MY BOY LOOKING ALL REAL AND SHIT! OMGAWD! I NEED WATER!
NO WAY THEY ACTUALLY DID IT THE MAD MEN ACTUALLY CALLED IT KH4
Versus 13 is back alive in KH4!
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE!!!!
PLEASE BE AVAILABLE ON PS4!
KINGDOM HEARTS IV IS REAL AND IT LOOKS GORGEOUS AYOOOOOOOO
Literally screaming at 5 in the morning! Ugh this makes me so happy, I was worried I’m not going to lie, but we eating good KH fans! Let’s go!
I don't want anything to do with those iOS/Android games. Kingdom Hearts 4 trailer starts at 4:07
I guess Switch won't able to play KH4... now my only wish is my phone will able to handle Missing Link.
Nice to know KH4 is coming but i'm not hyped until i see ACTUAL gameplay not a pre-rendered looks superb cutscene
He’s now in the real world?!
Estoy tan contento!!!!! 😭🤩
Kh4 is going to be absolutely insane 🤯
KH4 already?
Ahh man 🙌🏻
we never asked for this  -kh1, kh2 (not kh3) fan
Kingdom Hearts IV? Is it really real?
I just really REALLY HOPES that kingdom hearts 4 will be launch for ps4 too (since the price for a PS5 here in my country is too much expensive.) and also that it don't take too long for them to make (but since they are using a new engine since KH3 I believe it'll not take too long~)
They showed the seven missing upper-classmen! Looks like we will be seeing how everyone died (besides xehanort and eraqus since they were rescued by master odin)
Our boy Sora has come a long way from his small little island.
Omg it’s really KH4 I’m soo happy 🥲💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
Inb4 “Epic Exclusive”
Looks kind of mid. Not really excited after playing 3.
Looks like Donald and Goofy go to Hades for help
I'm so excited for this this literally made my day I love all these games and this entire franchise
KH4 …… dear god, we have reached ultimate glory
Yessss!!!!!
looks like garbage
AEEEEE CARAI KH4 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
HAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHA
Holy crap that all looked so damn clean!!! UR5?? It had to be
FF Versus XIII looking good~
Looks good but not a day 1 purchase for me after KH3 I can wait for all the dlc to drop
Welcome to Shibuya, it’s buck wild in here
Excited but also not excited for the hours of story on youtube i need to catch up on because I couldn’t get into the mobile games
Now we have to wait 5 years for this come out
When I tell you tears came to my eyes!!! 😭😭😭
My gooooooooooooooooooood I cant actually believe Nomura dropped this on us!! aaaaaahhhh!!!! a part of me knew that sooner or later we were gonna get probably another KH game, but THIS soon of an announcement?!?!? I.cannot.contain.the.hype. it looks so freaking gooooooooood!!! guess Ill start saving for the Limited Edition Playstation that will eventually come out with it haha
How does this have 12k views and 14k likes?
I wonder what Disney-worlds they’ll add to the 4th. Maybe Moana, Coco, Encanto, Princess and the Frog, Brother Bear, Turning Red and Zootopia?
The way I don't care about the story anymore but going to get Kh4 for the gameplay......man.....that's looking real good.
Yes a extreme development in Sora appearance. A worthy kingdom key transformation no second form duplication, this is so awesome! Can't wait to see Riku and Yozora I'm Quadratum
YESSS!!! I can’t wait for Kingdom Hearts 4 looks amazing. Would be awesome if they added at least marvel or Star Wars in it, but they might not though
Can someone take ketamine away from Nomura?
To be honestl missing Link could be realy fun! Especialy with multiplayer. (Granted we dont have much to go on but it looks like a solid mobile game.)
It’s weird seeing Sora without big yellow shoes.
i dont know man, Kingdom Heart 4 Gameplay's Trailer similar to Final Fantasy Versus ( Final Fantasy 15 First Teaser/Trailer )   why do i feeling like KH 4 gonna be canceled and changes too much differences than the trailer
BRING IT ON!!!!! I am ready for Kingdom Hearts IV!!!!!
I'm sobbing omg!!!! It all looks amazing!!!! Streletzia my baby 😭😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
When will the English version of this came. I hope Namine will be in Kingdom Hearts 4.
OMFG
Broooo wtfffff this is what I woke up too?? KH Hype is back baby LET'S GOOOOOO
wait a minute *SORA'S FEET ARE NORMAL SIZED* ??
Wait a minute. If Sora is in our world and our world is considered an afterlife… could it be possible that the other Norts are there too? Cause I’m now imagining Xemnas working at Starbucks and Ansem as a store CEO and I’m cackling! 🤣
Anybody noticed how Sora has normal normal shoes? Like KH3 tried but these are actual human shoes!!
Sora just pull off GIGA DRILL BREAK!
My God, i'm crying so damn much... Finally, finally a KH chapter/New saga with some FF stile. Maybe KH grow up (like us), after 20 years 👏🏻
my brain just combusted
6:55 FUCK YEAH!!!! NOW THAT'S MORE LIKE IT!!!!!
Doesn’t look like Sora... hopefully the gameplay is more fast over flash. No disney rides please. Transformstions would be fun though.
I’ve tried to get into this series and have failed. KH4 looks amazing maybe this is the one.
YOOOOOOO!!! WHaT A GOOD MORNING GIFT!! AND AHHHHH THE GRAPHICS!!!
Don't do this! Don't give me hope.
This doesn't even look or feel real. THANK YOU NOMURA
Guys we got Strelitzia in KH4! But it also makes since she's there bc of the "afterworld" thing she spoke of
whats up with the strong empresses on the dude with the phone  5:55    5:20
GOD DAMN
I know the game is still in development and things may change but it worries me how slow combat looks. It takes Sora ages to get to the Darkside.
"I'm only crying cuz I never dreamed,  it'd take this loooong"
WOW!!!🤩🤩🤩 AWESOME!!!🥰🥰  Now, I can't wait for see a sneak preview of the final chapter of "Kingdom Hearts: Dark Road" in the updates, "Kingdom Hearts: Missing Link" as a new story and "Kingdom Hearts 4" in the beginning of a new story arc, "The Lost Masters arc"!!!  And it looks just like Hades in alternate universe? And she's survived and alive? And Sora are in Quadratum? And everybody is coming back for more? Well, it's all connected and that was only the beginning of "Phase 2" of Kingdom Hearts story, which take place after the end of "Phase 1" and "Phase 0"!!!  And also, I can't wait for see "Kingdom Hearts 20th anniversary event" as a recap video of this event, which is coming later this date!!! LET'S GO AND SEE THEM ALL!!!  HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, KINGDOM HEARTS!!!🎉🎉🎂🎂
HADES IS BACK!!! Which means Olympic Coliseum may be too!! My favourite world. I cannot wait!!!
I just woke up from a nightmare and saw this. I think my days been made
HOLY FK, I CAN'T I AM CRYING HOLY SH*T
If KH3 wasn't the worst game I ever played maybe this could be exciting.
heh. KH4. See you in 7 years, I guess.
What happen to sora ?? 😭
MAKE SOME NOISE FOR MY GIRL STRELETZIA SHE’S FINALLY BACK BABY
YES YES YES.
Did I seriously witness a KH4 announcement before I turned 50?
YEEEEES LET'S GOOOO
OMG Yes!!!
FUCKING SPEECHLESS
視聴中ワシ「あースマホゲーかぁ…みんなガンバレー（寝落ちかけ）」 6:56のワシ「あーKH4出るんだぁ〜…… 　　　　　………キングダムハーツ4！！ 　　　　　　（眠気消滅）」
Final Fantasy Versus XIII sure has come a long way
With the insane success of Kingdom Hearts 3 we can finally see that Disney and Square Enix is finally putting some real resources into this game. We all thought it was going to end with three but no my good sir, Kingdom Hearts will never end and I'm okay with that.
Kingdom Hearts!
YEEEES
This story is gonna be crazy as all hell, I hope the can go back to kh2 fluidity the gameplay was the best in the series imo
All of us as fans are already having a field day with hype on this
Can’t wait for the spiderman world
I honestly hope this art style is only for kh4 or atleast bring in the Disney to quadratum i just don’t know how to feel 🥺
Kh4 omfg my day just got 10x better. This looks sick.
Can we just skip Sora and Create a new story yet?
KHIV LETS GOOOOO
The hype is real
I will never be able to know the story of the mobile games. T_T
don't those boy voices make you cringe? like, fk, can y'all dudes talk a bit away from the microphone? it's like their intention is to ear fc me with their tongues. hideous.
The girl is Strelitzia right? The one who got assassinated in Union Cross? KH4 hype and that Missing Link mmo hype is REAL.
What's the final boss of FF7Remake doing in the KH4 trailer? Ah no sorry, Nomura has finished the fantasy, he uses the same concepts for each of his games, sorry sorry.
Sora looks realistic like a Final Fantasy Character just like Cloud, Tidus and Noctis KINGDOM HEARTS 4/KHIV LOOKS SO HYPE AND OUTSTANDINGLY GOOD VERY IMPRESSIVE TETSUYA NOMURA!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
DON’T BELIEVE YOURSELF! BELIEVE IN ME! BELIEVE IN THE ME THAT BELIEVES IN YOU.  lololololol
thank you, Square enix ,youve made my day.
Alright, see you guys back here in 2028
We have sora-spiderman-noctis lessssgoooooo
Screaming and crying in pure joy at the same time and I have work in 30 minutes help.
😭
YOOOOOOO
I don't really like the art style. It looks nothing like Kingdom Hearts. More realistic graphics do not automatically equal better.
So…. 2033 or 2043? Since your track record on main title releases recently is too long from announcement.
The most jarring thing about this video is that Sora is finally wearing normal sized shoes.... I don't know how to cope with that
Why does realiatic Sora exist oh God oh fuck
OH MY GOD KINGDOM HEARTS 4
It seems like KH4 will be running on Unreal Engine 5, so hopefully the development of the game will go smoother for the developers and it will be interesting to see which new mechanics they’ll be able to incorporate in this new installment
Omg 💕
"are they RLY doin kh4 w/o the rest of the kings fools?!" *gets to the actual end* Oh, word? Oh those are my boys.
OMFGOMFGOMFGOMFGOMFOMFGOMFGOMFGOMFGOMFGOMFGOMFGOMFGOMFGOMFGOMFGOMFG NO FUCKING WAY!!!!!! OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOOMG WE DIDNT HAVE TO WAIT 14 YEARS FOR KH 4 OMFG OMFG OMFG IT LOOKS SO FUCKING GOOD OMFFG OMFG OMFG OMFG OMFG IM SO FUCKING EXCITED I DID NOT EXPECT THIS TO DROP AT ALL OMFG OMFG OMFG OMFG OMFG OMFG THIS IS THE SECOND BEST DAY OF MY LIFE (BEST DAY WHEN IT COMES OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
Normal fans: I'm so excited about KH4! The hardcore KH fans: ...and Sora FINALLY HAS NORMAL SHOE!
This is so fucking gorgeous
Hold up! Is that a drive bar!?
I've always loved the pureblood heartless designs so I hope that giant darkside looking thing is a sign of more of those things to come, also, I want to face invisibles again.
Who's going to turn into a boat or goat this time? The new villain? Goofy? Donald? Mickey? Or maybe you?!
oh man, i cant wait for KH4 in 2030 HYPE!
Please Square, make KH4 have Marvel worlds, worlds based on forgotten classics like Atlantis & Treasure Planet, and of course, *OSWALD.*
"Magic in the making" basically means "Now in development", and seeing as Kingdom Hearts III was announced as "in development" in 2013, and didn't come out until 2019... Well, I'm not going to hold my breath.
Missing Link looks interesting but if it's another gacha game I think I'll just watch other people play the game instead
FIRST TIME IN AWHILE I SCREAMED FROM HYPE!!!  Kingdom Hearts is back bois! 😍
I'm hyped for sure, but I'm also confused. We defeated Xehanort already, who the hell is running Org 13?
We’re gonna have to wait another 3 years for kh4
fingers crossed we get an Atlantis or treasure planet world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cool, you should be able to play this in 20 years.
Governor DeSantis confirmed as the last boss, get HYPED.
YOOOOOOOOO!
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  ITS HONESTLY SO HARD TO BELIEVE THAT WE RECEIVED KH3 3 YEARS AGO!?!?!
Bro I just woke up and I’m on the verge of tears😭. I seriously thought it was fake and that we were never getting another one😭
Please someone tell me. Was that hades at the end of the trailer
So weird seeing sora without the Big goofy shoes lol
HOLY FUCKING SHIT KEKSJSJSKSJSGSHS
Apparently the trailer is in unreal 4 and the game will be in unreal 5.  If true hype
Hopefully they realize the story is dogshit awful and streamline it but I'm happy the best part of the games (Donald and Goofy) are back!
Oh boi...can we pls stop with the spin offs in between on different devices that add little to nothing to the already convoluted story that not even Nomura has a grasp on...it's getting old and annoying. Can we start having a coherent story again pls?
Sora is all grown up
I'M CRYING SO HARD RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
LET GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
another reason not to end your life early
The Time Has Come! Execute Order “Save for PS5!”
TBH changing from "Now in Development" to "Magic in the Making" is really Disney-esque and has more flair to it. Disney PR surely knows what they're doing.
Anyone recognize the voice of the blue flame? edit: ahhh Hades
Je suis pure hype
NOMURAAAAA
KH4 looking like "Kingdom Hearts Versus 13"
KH4 coming 2034.
I don’t know how I feel about Sora looking so realistic
si aspetta la reaction di blur
I’m so excited for KH4 to disappoint me like KH3 did!!
HOLY SHIT THAT TRAILER I SAW WAS REAL?!
yeeeeeeeeaaaaAAAAAAAAAA!!A!A!AAAAAAAAAA!A!!A!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YO WHAT
Bro I’m crying after seeing Sora all grown up 😭
seeing sora and heartless in what is Basically Just IRL Japan is fucking insane to me . put them back in toontown . (it do look dope tho!!!!!!!!!!!!)
NO ! Ok !? NOOOO!  I've had enough of this series.... Kingdom hearts 3 was a Horror !! And Nomura is at his worst creative moment.
So….my next question is….is that mystery character a Disney character….an original kh character…..or a marvel character….and they don’t have to use the mcu they can use all of marvel comics if they wanted to.
THIS IS WHOLE NEW LEVEL , OH MY GODDD !!!
Wait WHAT?!
KH 4 looks very sick! Sora's lookin very fine and the graphic itself is beautiful. Well done Nomura sensei! 😭
https://youtu.be/ruWLOMJdy58 wow!!
Kingdom Heeeeaaaarrtttsssss!!!  Fill me... with the power... of HYPE!!!!
日本人おる！？日本の動画ではコメントできないから、ここにコメントしてみた！！！
Okay here’s my guess, Donald + Goofy are looking for Auron
We've arrived at a point, when KH has finally decided to hit a more mature story-line head on. I love how the trailer puts emphasis on Sora's connection to the concepts of "Crown" and "King" and showing that both the Master and Luxu want Sora to choose as stated in "The choice is yours once more" -- likely referring to how Sora chose to use the Power of Waking to save everyone from the fate written in the Book of Prophecies i.e when the whole "Darkness prevails, Light expires" appeared after they were defeated. It also aligns with the Falsus Rex and Verum Rex that we've gotten. Taking ownership of the Destiny and choosing it as the True King.
This is by far the best thing I’ve ever woken up to!!!!
Sora : "MY DRILL IS A DRILL THAT WILL PIERCE THE UNREALITY!"
NO FUCKING WAY
Does this mean I need to get a PS5 now? Seriously though, hot damn! This shut me the hell up. I was just thinking that it is too soon to announce another numbered title yet there it is
sora looks so sexy ahhhh
I’m lost for words
Still waiting on Kingdom Hearts on Steam pleasee
Oh good. A new storyline and yet NOTHING STILL MAKES ANY GODDAMN SENSE.
HOLLY MOLLY THIS IS ITTTTT!!!
oh..............my...............God................
IM CRYING OMG SQUAREEEEEEEE
None of this probably make it to final product on PS7.
This ... THIS IS INSANELY GOOD NEWS! THANKYOU KH TEAM!
Damn, Sora is looking like an actual Final Fantasy Character now, also that's probably Hades in the end. The blue flames, the slightly jokey/sarcastic tone of voice, and a red-orange like flame when pissed.
woooooow tanks square enix
Kh4 looks like a movie
Would love to play KH4 on the PS7!
Hehehe, honestly, i wasn’t expecting a announcement for KH4 to come this soon, but then again, considering of when KH3 was first announced, i guess it makes sense, a lot of interesting things is heading our way and can’t wait to see how they’ll turn out.
plz we need general grievous as boss and playable character Lol
Cool, but since you fucked up the series with 3 can't say any of this is worth doing. Good luck dragging people back I guess?
I was today years old when I found out I needed kingdom hearts in a final fantasy like style =
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS OMG YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES IM READY YES PLEASE I'M CRYING OMG
The only reason Sora was barefoot at first was to show he has normal sized feet I'm betting.
Super hyped to see Strelitzia and Sora!!
So... a 3D version of Ux aaand... Sora is still abussing the power of Waking. Dude even the black coat figure knows better and they are no Organization XIII... unless worlds in Unreality work different?  (Also anyone that has not played Ux and Dark Road is gonna be hella confused.)
I'm tearing up dawg
That came out of nowhere man. I'm currently having a bad time my computer files lost. This just made my day. Thank you.
Ohhhh I see. So they’re making what FFXV was supposed to be as Kingdom Hearts.
7:17 sans?
See you all in another 20 years
LFG
I hope we get gravity and time stopping magic back
Wait, so Sora had regular-sized feet all along? Mind blown.
冒険の続きだあああああああああああああああああ！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！
KINGDOM HEARTS 4 IM SO HAPPY!!! IM GONNA CRY HOLYFFFFFFFF IT LOOKS AMAZING
That is Strelitzia in Quadratum. I need to know more!  And the number seven again, the number of days Sora has been in Quadratum for.
MAN. KH4 HAS SUCH GRAPHICS I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE A REAL-LIFE-CONNECTED GAME
Don't get too excited; all they showed was a heavily scripted reaction button boss fight and the "real world" city setting which doesn't fit the theme of the series at all and makes it look like Final Fantasy 15.  This series died with the mediocrity that is KH3 and it just needs to be buried and left dead so they can stop tarnishing the legacy of 1&2
4:55 Sora wakes up. "Whoah! I had the strangest dream. Cloud and Sephiroth we're there, but also some weird people. There were plumbers, a hedgehog, vampire slayers, a bear that used a bird as a weapon, even a box guy mining and crafting."
o-o FF graphic kh eh
I am crying so hard right now😃 Because I can't stand its beauty!
literal chills
Fucking Sora, always sleeping..... goddam teenager!!
If Sora looks this good, can't wait to see Riku and the rest.
Omg.....now I have to replay EVERY single KH game leading up to this.
I got literal chills watching the reveal trailer for KH4, Sora looks soooooo good! Although I'm not sure who the girl is, have we seen her before in the series or is she new?
Wow!  Kingdom Hearts 4.. Can't wait to play that game in 2030 🤣😀🤣
*cries In kingdom hearts* this looks beautiful Omg
Ayy the know how to treat KH fans up in here ma boiiiiiiii🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hyped
Still waiting for a Steam release
AAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
I would like for Missing Link to come to Switch, was hoping for confirmation on something OTHER than mobile, but whatever... Also 4 is looking very, very promising, something about the parkour reminded me of the first gameplay teaser we ever got for 3, great stuff! Let's hope it doesn't come out in a decade this time, lol.
Ooooooooooooooooooooooh my goddd…. This looks fucking amazing I’m speechless… omg wow they FINALLY DOIN KH JUSTICE 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
6:46 That's definitely Luxu & Master Of Masters
WAIT WAAAAAAAAAAAT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Is the stage of KH4 in Shibuya?
Can't wait, when KH4 comes out at the end of the life cycle of the PS6
BRUH, "THE GRAPHICS" OF KH4 ARE TRIPPING ME THE F*** OUT!
KH4 giving me drakengard/nier vibes
Wait.... is that Hades at the end? I don't know who is his Japanese voice actor. If anyone knows then please tell me if it is him
I have no idea what the hell kingdomhearts is or what it is about and this real world stuff going on is not really helping me out either.
6:29 Sora went "Gurren Lagann" on a bitch!
Kingdom hearts becoming proper Final fantasy game
Too much, it's all too much! Where do I even start unpacking this? Dark Road: Yeah alright. Missing Links: Are the little statues part of the attacks? I hope I don't have to wear that hat. I want details on the closed beta. Kingdom Hearts 4: The graphics are impressive but I'll need to get used to it. The parkour looks awesome. Darkside's makeover is really intimidating. I'm sure Disney is still part of it but you'd never know it. I can't freaking wait!!!
I just HAPPEN to be awake for these announcements! 💙 👑💙 Kingdom Hearts fan for LIFE. The road to dawn.... to the next era of Kingdom Hearts. #KH20th
Now I’m going to get to the bottom of the Master of Masters, when I watch everything! 🙂🙂😁😁 😇😇⚠️⚠️
But that is a three at the end
I DON’T NEED SLEEP. I NEED ANSWERS!!!
Anyone noticed they revealed Sora’s FEET! This Is the true announcement!
I can't believed that, Missing Link LOOKS THIS GOOD ON MOBIILE XD.   Still gonna hope for Union Cross to be remade if possible.
"May you're heart be your guiding key" Master Of Masters
Your hearts will guide away from the world you know now never to return! Just like Sora
UWJSJAJJSHDVVDVBSNSJSJKAKAKAKWJDHFHFHFHHFBEHEHFYAAAAA
Ok, how many decades until release?
Hades at the end? welp another 5 - 6 years waiting :D
Nostalgia has been struck in my heart. Too bad I’m old and have kids and a full time job, otherwise I’d love to attempt at playing these storylines. I’ll just continue to watch through the window of the internet as my childhood slowly passes by…
two mobile games 😴😴😴  To most us older then this series gonna be super ancient when KHIV drops hard pass KH3 was meh i assume so for this combat was a major downgrade from KH2 what the heck happened but hope summons and not some cop out of disney rides are "summons"  the sora downgrade too tho i know y'all flexing them UE5 (i assume) gains but still can only imagine riku don't mess him up too man!
More likes than views! lol
What is the release date for KH4??
The hidden character is obviously Ades. He kept Auron from the "underworld" of final fantasy X
Wow that was fast. Considering how many years we need to get KH 3 trailer. However the gameplay in KH4 is kinda sus and i'm goin to lower my expectation for it
😦
Can't believe how excited I was waiting for that final part of the trailer. KH4 looks like it's going to be sick and we have our boy Sora back. It's finally been announced it's happening. Missing link looks like it's going to be interesting as well.
I always thought KH3 was just a dream until it was announced and released years ago. Now this is just phenomenal.
Is this a dream? Am I even awake?
This feeling I've missed is so much. To get the chance to feel happiness on this level again I can definitely wait.❤ Also IV was described as an ark...so here's to Kingdom Hearts V and so on!
Truly amazing 👏🏿
So thrilled!
Thought the 3 was the last chapter? Uff, now i have to get the entire collection to don't miss any connection, before trying this. And i still lack a strong pc and last gen consoles -.-
PLEASE MAKE HIS HAIR SPIKEY AGAIN AND MAKE THE HUD PORTRAIT AGAIN OTHER THAN THAT HIS DESIGN IS PERFECT
AHHH IM SO EXCITED I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW AMAZING THIS IS! THANK YOU SO MUCH!
Sora's grown up it'll make a man cry looking at that it's like everyone in the game has grown up with us players, may our hearts be our guiding key 😁✨😭
what
So excited! Woke up to an Instagram post came here so quick! Can’t wait!
Look at that amazing graphic and design of Sora! Simply beautiful
very scripted fights can be great with a rich and dense story along with them, kh3 didn't have that kind of story (to me) so i hope the devs will have learned what was great and what was missing in the previous game. Like a more "arcade" and "snappier" combat
Um dia feliz ❤️
Best announcement all day!
Let's get a redesign for Donald and Goofy, they need the drip too!
LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Bruhhhhhh A Sigard Game I'm Down For That... he looks boss and KH4... Let's Go #TeamNoSleep
If quadtratum is an afterlife of some sort does this confirm there will be another twewy crossover?
RECONNECT
This vid made me bust more than porn ever could
This looks sick as hell. Just hope that they fix the combat because its becoming a lot more hectic than it used to be  in the old games. They really need to make it so that you can access all the moves at a single button combination press. If bayonetta, gow and dmc can do it then theres no excuse for it not to be  done in kdh.
Nice time for 10 years of waiting
After the disappointment from kh3 I’m not convinced
Nomura knows that you can’t advertise a mainline kh game without the goat hades
OH MY GOD IT'S HAPPENING EVERYONE STAY CALM SJSJWSBJSSKAAJAA
BITCHHHHHHH MY GOD I WAS CRYING THROUGH THIS WHOLE THING LETS GOOOOOOO KINGDOM HEARTS IV HERE WE COME 😍😍😍😭😭😭
Looks... so so. Kinda intrigued especially since it's based in japan. Wonder how they will incorporate the disney worlds into it
7:16 Hades!?
6:29 Gurren Lagann????
I never would have thought KH could look so good in a more realistic art style. So fucking hyped.
Wait, If Sora is on the other reality, Quadratum, then the disney world that will appear in KH4 will also in different reality as well ??? ...
what
Yes!!!! Kingdom Hearts IV ❤️ The design of everything makes me so hyped for what's to come. That Darkside like enemy looks so amazing! And I am so hyped for Strelitzia's return!
So we have -Dark road continuation of the story -A mobile game in Scala ed Calaum  -Kh 4 with Budget Increase Darkside -A Donald&Goffy Spin oof  Daym Kh doesn't communicate much but they deliver.
Oh my god.. Older Sora. Please he's so grow up now, it makes so emotional. And that thing, that darkside.. Man it's so fucking cool omg omg LET'S GOOO
Honestly not a fan of the graphics of KH4, KH was starting to lose its identity with KH3, but now the artstyle is just another FF game, hopefully it’s a “kingdom shader” concept where he only looks like that while in quadratum.
WHEN YOU WALK AWAY YOU DON'T HEAR ME SAY
Omg KH4.... I had a 🍖r
i thought it will take lots of years again for a sequel. I'm glad i was wrong! Definitely gonna wait for this one!
This truly looks amazing!!! I can’t for it to be delayed 7 times and get to play it when I’m 38
LETSGOOOOOOO KH4 INCCCCCCC
So what I see is going to happen with kingdom hearts 4 in development wise that gameplay in Quadratum will be using unreal engine 5 for that realistic looks. Probably all their original characters will be using that engine so they look more final fantasy like. And the Disney aspects be left in unreal engine 4 which is already there it seems in the last scene with Donald and goofy. If this is the case I hope development takes a lot less since they can make the spectacle and amazing graphics for one world as the core focus then the rest in unreal engine 4. So we get that Disney charm and then the realism final fantasy charm as well. Since unreal engine 4 for most of kingdom hearts 3 had that cartoony feel like they had in the past and I guess with kingdom hearts 4 looking to move past on Disney stuff they want more that realistic feel with cars, people, cities etc. So I wouldn’t be surprised if we see reused worlds and assets so we can get this game in reasonable time. Then the highlight can be Quadretum and the unreal engine 5. Can’t wait for this!!
They have literally just turned Sora into FFXIII Versus Noctis at this point.
My heart is beating so fast right now. I actually can't calm down. I'm too excited for everything! I'm so happy I was born in a world that has Kingdom Hearts!
OMG !!! but for real tho, hope KH Missing Link is for PC or console port.. the graphic is a bit of waste for android or ios
Too much Final Fintasy. If we love Kingdom Hearts, it's because of all the elements, even the cartoon-like graphics: it was a stab to my heart to see Sora with that graphic style.
We’ve come a long way from some kids on Destiny Island.
Another 10 year countdown.
IT IS HAPPENINGGGGGGGGG!
Hopefully they take their time and do this one right, 3 was really good but kinda messy as hell as well. Excited for more Kingdom Hearts! Happy 20th anniversary
AHHHHH IT'S REALLY HERE!!!!
Fairy Godmother was right the hole time! Dream's can come true it we believe!!!!!!
Happy
ok let's see. 1. mobile game don't care... 2. mobile game don't care... 3. Kingdom hearts 4...!  STAND AT ATTENTION!
Wtf im hyped af for kh4
*Welcome to Kingdom Hearts IV, how can I help you?*  Hi, yes, I’d like to order Treasure Planet, Moana, Encanto, Incredibles (not sure which, maybe a “what-if-sequel” setting?), and Soul, please. Oh, also a side-order of an Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cameo. Any circumstance will do. Thank you!
I can't believe they already announced KH 4 with gameplay!!! 😭😭😭😭😭
I AM FREAKING OUT
Plot twist. It’s going to be another 20 years before we get this game. 😂
I was not ready for today
Another example of a franchise being milked to death.  The main series should have ended with KH 3, but instead of giving us a conclusion with a happy ending where sora is finally with Kairi , we just get a bullshit cliffhanger.  All so we can get more spinoffs and sequels to a franchise that has a linear story.   For the love of all that is holy end this.  Make 4 the last one.  Start a new franchise, make something new please.
May your heart be your guiding key
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 aw ya sooo stoked
First time I hear Japanese Donald and Goofy, and god DAMN do they sound almost identical to Tony Anselmo and Bill Farmer.
Eh, ill wait until after its released this time with how much of a stinker 3 was over all.   Which dosnt matter to much for now considering it wont come out until 2030 anyways.
These graphics......yes, I confirm that my computer will smoke, fire and will not support this game at all lmao 🤣🤣.
Looks cool i'd cheer more if i wasn't sick
4 is so a animated thing.. its not gameplay.
KH4!!! PLEASE DON'T BE A NEXT GEN EXCLUSIVE! 😭
This Sora looks so much better here than in III. It's so good to see him, Donald and Goofy again.....is that Strelitzia?!
3:02 No way!! I predicted that there could be another KH Mobile Game though but... Is this an Open World KH Mobile Game!? OMG! 😲😱
Plz be better than 3,pretty plz.
Bless everyone at square Enix 😭
Se les han ido de las manos poner el mundo real jajajaa, pero me alegra sabee que ya se ve algo de kingdom hearts IV! 😍💗
fuck yes
Wow it looks gorgeous
OMG IS THAT Strelitzia!!
Sora Giga, drill breaker
Kingdom Hearts IV: After Smash Bros.
Yooo Ezio Auditore in KH?
Bro I've weebed so hard right now KEEN AS A BEAN!!!!!
I better not see any damn Disney rides.
yikes
YOOOOOOOOOO
WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE 😭😭😭
BROOOOOOOOOOO WHAAAAAAAAAT
ITS TRUE!
O MY GOD
I was not prepeared for hd Sora holy hell
Really Donald and Goofy you go to Hades for help i get why but that's very dangerous it's for Sora i suppose
I wonder what will come out first, final fantasy XVI or Kingdom Hearts IV??!?!
Well, this means that fans will not have to wait over a decade to see the next big game! That's cool!
Feels kinda weird that we are not having something like Kingdom Hearts III ~Birth by 358/2 Days~ Final Re:Mix  or something and straight up going to the next numbered title. Anyway, it is really exciting seeing that we are having KH IV right away.
LETTTSSSSS GOOOOO!!!!
Why is Olympus collosioum the start again...
Please, less disney. KH3 was heavy on the advertisements. Didn't nomura say there was gonna be a lot less disney in the next one, if at all?
Well KH3 was…..disappointing in many ways especially the story. But I’m still excited for this!!!!  See you in next decade 😅
I HAVE JUST WATCHED THIS 4 TIMES
REALISTIC SORA!!!!!
Just don’t make it too long again just like KH3
Is that Strelitzia!?
Woah! Anybody else Downloading Kh3 Again and playing all the way through Just from the Hype of this!?
Bruh, Sora looks so good in the final fantasy graphics!
I’m so glad that Darkside got an upgrade
Bruh really cannot let 13 versus go XD.
YES!!!!!
OHHHHH MY GOD!!!!!!
Oh man looks like we dont need a vessel after all. I'm just so excited but please take all the time and don't announce a release date if the game is not ready

I always wondered how sora would look like if he is in ff7 remake/ff15 shader and now its real
OH MY GOD KINGDOM HEARTS 4, EVERYBODY CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN
Stop, stop, it's already dead!
Oh my god! Im so glad I wasnt spoiled for this!!!! This was the best surprise this year! Thank you for not making me wait 20 years for KH4!!!! Im so happy!!!
My fangirling and hype to Kingdom Hearts has rise again after 2 years break from the franchise 🥹🥹
KH4 looks beautiful 😩😍😍😍 I was so young when this started
I can understand everyone’s excitement and all…but PLEASE LOWER THE HOPES IMMEDIATELY!!! We are legitimately repeating history by having a KH mainline game get announced too early, having it get lost in development hell alongside FF7 Remake, and having to wait for possibly 3+ years for world announcements, SOLID gameplay, etc.
OMG! The design of Sora in KH4 it's really weird, he has lost all its features of big shoes and cartoon look
And of course there’s the one idiot videoing on his phone instead of running
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
6:30 GIGA! DRILL! BREAKER!
i'll spend $1000 on kingdomhearts 4.
I can already tell the ultima weapon is gonna look AMAZING in this game based off of the IV. looks like maybe a greatsword with an offhand dagger or gun perhaps??
Strelitzia?!
When do we play this event or dlc?
WOWWW
So sora in the modern world still kept his design outfit but more realistic style than his cartoony version shit looks fireeeee
Dang, that graphical update sure is nice. But at the same time, a part of me wonders if it's all that wise; since a lot of 0games pre-0.2 managed to get away with reusing assets with minor touch ups and that seemed to save a lot on development time. I understand they had to start fresh with KH3 because PS2 graphics weren't gonna fly on the PS4 as well as they did the PSP or 3DS; but are those KH3 graphics and models not still acceptable at present? I always thought the longevity of these things was one of the strengths of Kingdom Heart's artstyle.
Holy shit! I wasn't expecting IV to be revealed so soon. This means that we won't get handheld games inbetween on different systems aside from the mobile games which I am glad for. More time to work on console main entries and to get them out faster.
Versus Kingdom 13 looks great.  But I'm gonna NOT think about it for another 10 years again.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
They finally ditch the cartoonish art style to realistic
DARKSIDE HAS EVOLVED !!!
Was that Hades that met Donald and Goofy?
I think everyone who’s seen this so far has liked it well deserved I have been playing kh since I was a kid and I’m so thankful to see what it’s become
WHAT THE WHAT?!
YOU BETTER INCLUDE TURNING RED IN THIS GAME
Am I the only one who is surprised to see Sterlitzia here?!!!!
Wtf is going on. I got tested positiv today and its still one of my luckiest day. Thanks for that Square <3
Why does kh4 feel like digimon. The real world colliding with disney
Ugh crack😩👌🏾
I hope there are some FF characters this time around
The gameplay looks shit like kingdom hearts 3, but its still in development, not getting my hopes up again so I'm not burned, but I hope the plot is more interesting and we get more answers
IF they actually focus on the story this time, the hype train is ready to start
Listen after she finishes her line at 5:21. Is that Sora's voice that says "mm" sort of as to acknowledge what she's saying?
As great as KH4 news is, I'm more excited for Dark Roads. I assume that's the last update for it? I only saw the like..first 5 or so cutscenes before I decided to wait for everything. And hopefully Missing Link explains what happens to our boy Ephy after UX. I assume the PC will be a new keyblade wielder since ours in UX...yeah.
KH4 release................. 10 years later
This look so awesome 😍, I honestly think this new arc maybe Sora Vs the keyblade masters. However that's a theory.
Oh damn 😍
This looks absolutely amazing!
I dont know what to say as a fan of this Franchise. I Played the games over and over. But KH3 was a little but kick. I dont know what to think about the 4th now after i saw this. When this is so more in Realism. Please then do more FF stuff.
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
LESGOOOOOOO
Why are Sora's shoes so small
OMFG WISDFJDG;LKAJSD;LGKJA;LDSGJ I CANT BELIEVE IT
Kingdom Hearts IV see you in 2033 on the PS8
i'm glad today is not April 1st.. and it's real !
I just hope 14 years isnt how long it takes to get this title.....
Damn sora new look i hope kh4 comes out soon
I know everyone is hyped. But I just feel like it’s not gonna be that good. But I honestly didn’t like kh3 either and this looks and feels the same
KEYBLADE WITH CHAIN
yessssssssssssssssssssssss
What the helll !!!!!!! Streltizia ?!!!!!!
I'm soooo excited for this 😍😍😍
Are they using unreal engine 5!?
KINGDOM HEARTS IV!!!!
Please, have some final fantasy characters in this one
SPIDER MAN AND TREASURE PLANET WORLDS IN KINGDOM HEARTS 4?!  DISNEY INFINITY KEYBLADE TOO?!!  PLEASE?!
Pls, for god sake don't make magic as dumb as in KH3. KH2 and 1 had good magic.
LETS FUCKING GO!!!!!
So is Hades gonna appear again? The last voice line looked like it was spoken by the Japanese impersonation of James Woods.
sora got noctis'd
OH. MY. GOD.
Dilo baity, dilo
LET'S GOOOO!!!! 😭😭😭
Kingdom Hearts IV will release in 2042
Bitch WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTT OH MY GODDDDDDD

Super excited, I'll see you all at the 30th anniversary when KH4 is released for the PS8
Bruh they just revealed Strelitzia like that
WAİT WT-
To get it confirmed THIS QUICKLY is just.. Wow Wowoww
Wait but it hasn’t been 10 years yet? Dam looks like the world might actually get better
Ive been having these weird thoughts lately... like is any of this for real.... or not..?    What an amazing thing to wake up to. Kingdom Hearts 4 is confirmed guys. I've been waiting to say those words but I never thought it'd be this soon. Thank you Nomura and Kingdom Hearts team.
THAT WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!
The most bizarre part of all of this is Sora with normal sized shoes.
Yesssssssss!!!!!
Thank u for giving us the forth game sora looks cool
God I hope Fullmetal Alchemist is at least referenced in KH4.
What the hell is going on here.
This looks incredible! But this should have been a new franchise.
OMG That Kingdom Hearts IV graphics looks AMAZING.... AHHHH ! ! ! !
“Let your Heart be your guiding Key.”
I hope Kingdom Hearts 4 will be on switch too.
The hype for Kingdom Hearts trailers is BACK!!!
Is there a person willing to catch me up? I thought 3 was the conclusion.
OMG THIS IS SICK!!! KH4 Looks so amazing and I’m so hyped for it!!!!!
Dang, those graphics 😮
OMG ITS HAPPENING
LET'S GOOOO
...I guess this is wasn't supposed to be aired 9 days before, right? :0 I'm speechless.
Strelizia looks so good in full 3D render!! I always loved her design and I'm glad she's finally showing up in a mainline KH title!
Release 2032
Omg that’s sora
Now we wait for Kiryu Kazuma appear in the game. Just kidding, So excited for the game!!!
I was about to say square Enix is back on they bs with all these side projects no one cares for. I don't have it in me to be playing these side games to get context anymore, BUT they showed that beautiful kh4. Thanks square enix for not putting us through that stuff yall had us go through b4 kh3 came out. *Knocks on wood* please don't go through development hell. Let's all wish for a great and easy development for this game
You guy's made my morning LFG KH4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A choir version of dearly beloved and it slaps
NOW PLEASE DON'T LET US WAIT 8 YEARS AGAIN!!
My jaw was dropped during the KH4 reveal!!  So when he's in the world of Quadratum, his hair will have a more realistic style?
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
Where Verum rex?
I'm... disappointed. Frankly. I was really hoping for a Days remake. I was hoping for anything but a Kh4 announcement because it's way too soon for it, but whatever.
If this is where we get star wars and marvel worlds imma nut
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
So I'm guessing that secret cutscene of Sora ending up in Shibuya or whatever (with Riku and Yozora present) is him ending up in the Quadratum? So then that means the other two would be there too?
HOLY SHIT THE GRAPHIC!!!!!! My laptop melts just watching this trailer
Kingdom Hearts 4!!!!!!!!!!
can’t wait till this comes out in 6 years
Kingdom hearts 4 coming 2030
Was that actually Sora this game is just a complete change to anything weve ever seen before!?!?!?!?
Now I really gotta finish bbs
See you 10 years later
Thank Namine.
I’m so proud of Sora. After 20 years he’s found a fitting pair of shoes
The world is starting to turn
HOLY FCK
That Nvidia leak wasn't wrong....
I just know this is gonna make the story so much more convoluted and I am so ready. BRING IT ON KH4 HERE WE GO!!
Yaaaaa let's GOOOOOOO
Hate to be that guy buut.... another mobile game over something that utilizes all characters that we won't see or play as from the past saga? When I think of a 20th anniversary, I think of a project where I'm utilizing all my past characters in a way where people can enjoy them. Thank you modders for giving us things we ought to have gotten some time ago.
SORA REALLY HAS SIZE 17 FEET
SHE’S ALIIVEEEEE
LOOKS LIKE REACTION COMMANDS ARE BACK BABY!!! HOW I MISSED THEM! HERE WE GO KH 💙
Dangg, its really been a while from kh 2 to kh 3, and now we got kh 4 news
HOLY ******
Having only just got into this series as I must have been living under a rock I'm so excited 🎉🎉🎉
Ohhhhhhh Baby!! This is it. Get ready and buckle up. Tickets for the hype train are on sale and your all invited Ladies and Gentlemen.
Ooh kingdom hearts 4
Wait... so Sora has regular sized feet? HE CHOSE TO RUN AROUND IN THOSE CLOWN SHOES!?
DONT FORGET GUYS, ITS COMING OUT YEAR 9999 ;)
I LOVE KINGDOM HEARTS!!!! IM SOOOOOOO HAPPY OMG!!!!!!!!
The eternal waiting for a new Kingdom Hearts game has returned 😂♥️
Kingdom Hearts IV lesgooo
You know the biggest surprise was that they actually used a 4 for the title and not 3.2
Release in 10 years
bless your heart nomura and everyone else working on the series, i'm excited
I‘ve been having these weird thoughts lately.. ..like is any of this for real or not?
If you die in Kingdom Hearts, you get sent in to the real world  But really though, I'm so excited!! Sora and Strelitzia look so amazing!! I can't wait for more KH4!!
Can’t believe this is exactly what I wanted for the next kh
My, how very, very interesting, i will look forward to this.
Perfect! This is what we actually needed.
Kingdom Hearts 4? Never thought I would see this happening.
Damn! Sora got that Final Fantasy glow up!
KH4 trailer was simple and clean, pure magic!  Yet another new reason to keep on living in this world full of darkness.  Hope it doesn't take a decade for it's release. 😅🖤
Tremenda belleza 20/10 y god.
Its been 20 damn years.
OH MY GODDDDDDDDD, The Lost Master Arc aka Phase 2 already looks insane. God I can't wait!!!!!
WTF SORA IT’SO BADASS MAN !!!!!! Kh4 it’s real guys KH4 !!!!!! Thx square !!!!
LET'S GOOOO!
I can't even make jokes I was not expecting this hype bomb *KH4 is a thing and it's coming!*  And 2 mobile games, too... which I know I'm gonna play, Missing Link does not look half bad tbh
wow for mobile 😍
Damn.... I wish this has PC release
I'm excited for Kingdom Hearts 4!! But am well aware I won't see it for about 14 years 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can't wait to play this in 15 years on the PS8
OMG Hype 💜
Sadly as a Final Fantasy Fan, I am torn... Sucks that Kingdom Hearts is Partially owned by Disney... Currently planning to boycott anything Disney due to them coming out as Pro Child Grooming... Sorry I can't get behind a company like that.
actually using the keyCHAIN and the hook being shaped like a heart, that design is SO GOOD!!!!
Ok, I wasn’t sure how hyped to be for that last one because I couldn’t tell what it is. Believe me, it was phenomenal and beautiful, It’s just that IV didn’t even cross my mind because, well…you know. Figured it was “Sora and the Forgotten Land” or something, but nope. It’s IV. It’s happening and I am hyped!  What was the gap between this game’s announcement and the third compared to two and three?!
WE GOT IT how comes the hard part waiting for it to release so as we say May our hearts be our guiding key
I hope Sora isn't in Quadratum for look because man does he look super generic there.
Is this even Sora
I BELIEVEEEDDDDDDDD !!
It's a MIRACLE! Oh my God, I'm so happy!!! I have no words!!
Can't wait to play KH4 in 2032 on my brand new PlayStation 6
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
where is kingdom heart on steam ?
Kingdom Hearts 4 in the making!!!! which means we probably won’t see it until 2035🙄🤦🏾‍♂️
Marluxia and Larxene will be major players in this arc.
HELL YEAH
5:04 THE RETURN OF THE PRECIOUS ONE!!!
The FF Graphics of Sora and Donald and Goofy Disney animation is just amazing... man, now we explore FF worlds??
MY GOSH IT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND STUNNING!!!!
KH4 let’s gooo!!! Please contact Hayden Panettiere from now to voice Kairi (if she’s in this game) and please give us the KHI or KHII nostalgia this time! Make us proud Tetsuya!!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏
So hyped for this game still gonna miss thos big shoes of sora :/ (hoping he still get’s some other clothes like kh1&2&3 haha…) + hopefully they don’t spoil the entire game with trailers as they did with kh3
Quadratum???!! Bitch that's Tokyo
OMGGGGG
Square Square listen This all takes place in a realm outside the KH normal world. So How about Oswald the lucky rabbit? Eh? EH? CMON AT LEAST THAT
I never would've thought after all this time we'd come this far
I have no words to describe how remarkable it is , I simply have no words 😍😍😍😍😍
This is exciting and kinda sad. I hope they’re not away from the magic and charm the first KH games brought. And still no FF characters in sight 😭
Hype!!
I hope this franchise goes on for long time cause 3 made me feel like it’s coming to a end soon
Holy shit, we're getting a new Kingdom Hearts game!?!?!?
So if forespokens traversal is as good as it look, I'm 100% looking forward to how sora will move in this game.
I can't believe this Kingdom Hearts 4! Omg omg omg!   It looks like a Final Fantasy game!!!   Yes!!
Our boy all grown up now 😭!
I hate the art style for KH4, I hope it's just that art style for that world.
What a time to be alive
Fuggin' sicc
I cant breathe... after the wait for 3 I was buckled in for another but then this out of nowhere... WOOOOOOOOOO!
I can hear Hades voice at 7:22  That blue flame too...
And how long would that take?
Well, this looks like a horrible direction for KH to take  thanks for the shit ideas Nomura
Okay.... 4 has me intrigued
Coming 2030
Honestly surprised we're not getting spin off with Aqua and Kairi before KH4
SUCH GOOD SHIT!!!!!!!!
Please dont mess this up like KH3. More Sidequests, more FF Characters and for nomuras sake i want the olymp back
Hopefully we get a more mature sora
As a fan from the very beggining, since I was a 3-4 yo kid (now 22), I could say a lot of how this looked to me and how I feel after watching it, but at the same time, I have no words, I'm speechless, and I think that says everything and a lot. 😳❤️🔑✨ Beyond excitement. 🎮
RIP, Sora's Mickey Mouse Shoes 😞
IM SCREAMING AAAAAAH CANT WAIT … GUYS THE GRAFIC , AND WE WANT DONALD AND GOOFY AS CHARACTER PLAYABLE
I was never interested in the mobile games, but KH4 looks incredible! Super stoked!
fuck yeah and that  dearly beloved update remix 👀❤😂👍👍the god of the darksides 👀
Looks amazing! Certainly didn't expect Strelitzia but I guess they're both in this afterworld, which probably also why Donald and Goofy are looking for Hades.
I just hope Kingdom Hearts IV will have better physics since it's set on a more realistic world
This is a -fantasy- Kingdom Heart based on reality
If you unironically buy KH4 after the utter shit that was KH3, may god have mercy on your soul.
Ah, Kingdom Hearts 4, eh? Neat. See you in 5 years
7:18 undertale
HOLY FUCK.
Sora with no shoes…. What does this meannnnnnn???!!!!!!!!
Originally when I saw Sora's new look I was a little bit sketchy, but now, I really like the possibilities this brings, and am so excited for the future
Am i dreaming or is this real?🤯⭐️
I only found out recently that Kingdom Hearts and myself have the same “anniversary” day. 😂 March 28, 2002! I turned 20 this year, and now I finally get to experience the launch of a new KH game! This is my favorite timeline— I can’t wait to see how great KH4 is!
I’m ready for the next instalment of Kingdom Hearts series.
This version of dearly beloved is sooo sick!
The start of a new era. 'Magic in the Making', indeed! 😍  My heart is so full of love, awe and pride as another epic chapter begins in my most beloved series. 💓 Kingdom Hearts has been an irreplaceable, truly special part of my life for so long, and will forever be. It has been an immense, heartfelt pleasure to grow alongside this masterpiece of a story and characters that I dearly love and root for with my whole heart. Lots of love to the entire KH team and KH community for all their hard work, dedication and passion these past 20 years. This family is home, KH is home. ❤  Happy 20th Anniversary Kingdom Hearts, here's to many more unforgettable, beautiful memories, magic, and wonder. 👑💛🗝
Kingdom Hearts 4 Hype starts NOW!!
LET'S GOOOOOOOO!!!!!
6:25 THIS IS THE DRILL THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS
when it took a while for kh3 to get off the ground (due to technical and legal work) thus I felt really old when it finally did came out  due to that though, the transition to kh4 is much more smoother and quicker because the dev team already has the tools needed to make kh4
i have mixed feelings for this. i meam, i still mad for the trash we got on switch, but this makes me happy
What if a part of the reason Sora looks different is that Quadratum is again different ley line and his clothes and appearance got changed. Hence his new attire.   Plus Streletzia said he arrived in Quadratum 7 days ago. So does that mean Sora was away for like a whole year in between ley lines and then appeared in Quadratum not that long ago?
Love it! Can’t wait to play it in 5 years!
holy frik number 4 yaaas!!!
GUYS, ITS HAPPENING, ITS ACTUALLY HAPPENING, IM NOT CRYING YOU ARE!!!!!
Sigh... great now I gotta request the whole week off to beat this and Platnum the game thanks alot!
I LOVE IT AHHH
So long as the gameplay holds up and it's much longer than what KH3 was, I'll still give it a go.
who else shed tears ?
All aboard the hype train to dissappointment 2.0 Visually it looks a lot like FF7R, and the "gameplay" reminds me of DMCV. Which it surely wont be as good as. But hey, at least Dolan and Gooby are visiting Hades.
The song used for the Kingdom Hearts Missing Link trailer is fire🔥
i can't wait for PS 7 to come out
Kh4, probably for ps5 & xb series, looks sick. But common, two new games for mobile?! We need a exclusive new KH for the Nintendo Switch :((
A surprise to be sure but a welcome one indeed!!!!!!!
Are Donald and Goofy in Hades??? XD
When Spider-Man inspires KH
KH3 was a 10 year wait and a let down so I’ll just wait and see
sorry after all the bullshits I won't pick up the hype just a Blizzard meme............... don't you have phones!
Man the gameplay looks like ff7 remake when sora came to defeat the enemy 😳
No more comically large shoes😢
Not here for another mobile game( I'll watch the YouTube video with all the relevant stuff when it's done) but KH4 tho🔥
SANS UNDERTALE KINGDOM FARTS 4!?!?!?!?!
IS THIS A DREAM?????😭😭😭♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Dude I nearly fell outta my bed. It looks amaazzzingggg
STRELITZIAAAAAAAA!!
WOWWW
Alright Men what 6 Disney world are going to this time
Donald and Goofy are looking for Auron !
ANDHCHCBDH 7BCHCD CBHDD JDNJSNJSJCNJSNIASNIDNDISNINS OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD YEYSYEYSYSYEYEYSYEYSYEYSYYSYEYSYEYEYSYESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS I’M NOW EAGERLY WAITING FOR THIS GAME I’M SO SO HYPEDDDDDDDD
Everybody here is hyped for the game and so am I, but am I the only one thinking "no more clown shoes" Like they have normal feet now compared to before
Be honest we didn’t expect KH4 for at least another 5 years. 😮‍💨
Watching that new game, I can already tell it's PS5 exclusive. Meh.
The way they managed to make KH4 look like the most generic game, glad I lost interest after the mess that was KH3. This looks so bad on top of all the f2p crap.
They all looked kinda bad.
I randomly wake up at 7:30am, hop on YouTube, see this video and remember KH is 20 years old so I click to watch it, and lo behold KH4. I woke up to do my exam thats at 9am...
GIGA....DRILL....BUREEEEKAAA!
Man I so love this series but all these spin off games are making it so complicated to keep up with the lore. I couldn't keep up with the mobile game cause it became impossible to pass things without paying money. I am excited for the console game but I feel like im gonna be left in the lurch trying to learn what I'm missing
Wtf that's Noctis with Sora's head
Did anyone else's heart sink upon learning that Missing Link is a mobile game? I just hope it'll be one I can actually purchase this time.
While i think we can all agree that the graphics look amazing, i think it is sad we stray further and further from the original artsyle.
And still no Steam release of the series....
Lol Sora no longer have oversized shoes
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
STRELITZIA !!!! YEAHHHH SHE HEREEEE! MARLUXIA GO GET YOUR SISTER!
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
I’M Y’ALL SCREAMING AND MY FAMILY ARE LOOKING AT ME LIKE I’VE GOT OUT AT THE ASYLUM LMAOO.
SORA LOOKS SO GOOD, IM SO HAPPY ITS KH4
holy fucking shit
It makes sense including Hades. After all, Quadratum seems to be some kind of afterlife for KH characters and he was shown to cash in souls from multiple worlds, not just his own.
NOMURA'S WILD RIDE NEVER ENDS
Es el momento ideal para que anuncien un anime para Disney+ contando la historia del primer juego! C'mon!
Dammit Nomura!
DID KH4 REALLY JUST GET ANNOUNCED!? IM LOSING IT 🥹
STRELITZIA
MAGIC IN THE MAKING IM SURE HADES WILL HELP BEST DUO FIND SORA AND YEAH KH3 STYLE MODERN SAME LIKE FF15  NEW ARC LETS GOOOOOOOOO
6:29 GIGA.... DRILL... BREAKAAAAAAAA
Is a stylist design to look like shit?
No wayyyyyyy wtf
God I hope we get Kumandra (Raya and the Last Dragon) and Encanto in this game. Imagine exploring these worlds. The possibilities are endless.
I just woke up and saw this, oh my god hype!
This looks incredible 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Missing link looks like it should on consoles not mobiles
Treasure Planet or bust.
YOUHOUUU IM HAPPYY
Ghostwire tokyo w/ sora mod
Okay so that's definitely Hades at the end with Donald and Goofy, this question is where the hell are they? It's either The Realm of Darkness or The Underworld possibly. Though the Underworld isn't pitch black from what I recall, whereas RoD is in certain parts.. Hmm...
This trailer had everything, gameplay, action, drama, quadratum, strelitzia, Sora's actual feet size
I seriously have no words to describe how happy I am! I joined kingdom hearts when dream drop distance came on the 3ds and I've stayed with the series since then! KH4 looks amazing, and I feel like I'm dreaming! Can't wait to play it!!
Kh4 looks amazing. OMG
Wow wow wow wow wow kh4 looks amazing the graphics look stunning
Great now I must wait 10 years I will be 40 by then, and probably lost interest on games
WE NEED THIS.... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!
Been waiting for a realistic Kingdom Hearts game for the longest time and this fulfilled my every expectation and more. Thank you Nomura and team! Seeing Sora grow up with us is an amazing feeling.
SO EXCITED!!!
Who's the guy with blue flame scaring donald and goofy in the end? Is it hades? Im not familiar with their japanese voices
I did *not* expect it to switch to gameplay footage at 6:08 😭 It looks so good?! Sora’s outfit is great! What is this Gurren Lagann?! Bayonetta?! I’m so excited
S P I C Y  A S  H E L L
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
toccus sto aspettando la tua reaction @blur
GOOD GOD THIS WAS WORTH STAYING UP FOR
Well shit...
KH4 YEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSS
The iOS ganes sucks, why are they still doing games for pones?
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!  Ah man am I glad to be a part of this journey.. Kh4!  Woo! 😭😍 I did NOT expect to see something on it this early though- and did you see those graphics?? FfXV anyone? SO GOOD!   That mobile game looks hype too, can't wait :D
2027 release date let's hit it
Oh man while KH4 is still pretty far away on their development, I hope we get to own a PS5 soon. Or probably wait for their KH4 PS5 limited edition bundle?
There are few things that can make me as happy as a child in a candy store. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS! WE'RE FINALLY BACK BOYS!
This is gonna be awesome. I wanna be part of the closed beta. Was that Hades meeting with Donald and Goofy at the end?
I love kingdom hearts 4 it looks so super really good The graphics and the style just like final Fantasy 7
Still getting ffvs13 vibes, this makes me happy.
Espérons que les jeux soit en français cette fois !
Holy shit!!!!
KH4??? We really got kh4 trailer???? omgg im soo happy!!!😭 realistic sora looks soooo good!!! cant wait, hope they dont hold the release date for too long.
Well, we’re going back on the hype train. Let’s GOOOOOOO!!!!!
Oh my fucking God, KH 4 ! 😳  Shut up and take my money ! 😍
KH missing link...... that girl in green attire...... That looks a lot like Freya isn't it? don't you think i'm letting it slide SQEX!
I can't really play the games because I don't really have any console or the money to get the game for PC but can't wait how all this will unfold... Also, What are Goofy and Donald doing with Hades?!
KH4 look awesome!!. I'm wait excited
This is the 20th anniversary that this series deserves! I can't wait to play every one of these games!
was that MoM at the end???
INCREDIBLE !!!!!
Wow, sora actually has normal shoes now
KH 4 better be good enough to compensate how messy KH 3 was.  ...but dat graphics tho 🍗👌
Ina must be so happy right now!
the last time a number title got announced we didn't get it was 6 years lol
KINGDOM HEARTS 4!!!!!! YESSSSSSS
1 thumb up for Kingdom Hearts 4, 2 thumbs down for the phone games
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The one thing I love about the KH4 trailer is Donald and Goofy asking Hades for help
OMGGGGGGGGGG
PEAK FUCKING FICTION
Today's a great day already! KH4 is happening I can't wait to see more of it! Let's go!!
me vuelvo loco
Dayum Sora became Korean guys 😂
Nomura desperately trying to make Versus XIII a reality he turned Sora into Noctis
BRAIN!!!!
AWESOME JUST AWESOME MY HEART! 💙💙💙KH4!!😭
Why does sora look 21? Haha. Super hyped for this though, can’t wait to see and hear more!
Nomura will not rest until FF 13 VS becomes a reality.
6:09 this moment is real gameplay!? 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Really awesome can’t wait. Really looking forward to seeing the new Character’s in Missing Link. Also...MAN finally I’m so glad Sora found a way for his Kingdom Key transformation. In KH3 I found it so awesome how Terras Keyblade could keyblade transform, as well as the other keyblades Sora weirder they could transform, but his.... kingdom key, was always just plain...an not that interesting, mabe it was in the first game but at this point his keyblade should have a second form or evolve.  Hopefully he gets his keyblade armour soon as well. An I must say I’m not a fan of his new look.....he doesn’t even look like Sora, for second I thought he was Yozora or a young Yozora or something. But who knows mabe he just looks different in this world, but everything else was great.
LETS GOOOOOOOO
I didn't mind the mobile games but they had like 300 or so stages with only 50 progressing the story then they just shut it down. I just hope they don't call back to the games that much because I'm not watching/reading a recap of those lol.
Somehow I knew KH4 was the Verum Rex game. But what is the new mobile game? Is it an MMO? Is it Union X with redesigned gameplay? And what are those new worlds we’re visiting? I saw Rapunzel’s Kingdom, Castle of Dreams, and Enchanted Dominion, but what are the others? Is that factory from Newsies? Or better yet…HAMILTON?! This summer, I. Want. Answers!
OMG,THIS IS HAPPENING GUYS!!!!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
So I'm guessing you if die in the KH world you enter Quadratum or something?
Spoiler warning       I KNEW STRELITZIA WOULD COME BACK SOMEHOW!!!
All games in french language!
やっばーい‼️ 唐突すぎて叫んだわ🤣   発売2024、25年くらいだといいなぁ🤔
I AM SHAKING WITH HAPPINESS RIGHT NOW OMG
THIS IS AMAZING!
Looks cool
Whoah! ✨🤍🤟🏽
YOOO.!!! WHAT THE FUUUUUH.!!!
No words. just perfect news
I hope James Woods would come back to voice Hades in this sequel.
We’re getting another mobile game! LET’S GO!!!
Was that a GIGA DRILL BREAKER?????
feels surreal that we do not have to wait for ages for the next Kingdom Hearts numbered title
It is surprised that there's no 7-8 spinoff title before kh4
See ya all in 5 years when KH4 gets released.
Thanks, I hate it. I hate the new look.
Donald and goofy going to hades the lord of the dead to bring sora back from the afterlife is a pretty good idea lmao finally soras feet are cannon.
I don't understand. KH X Dark road was a game and they closed it last year. Now they're going to release it once again?
Strelitzia! I’m so happy to see her! Imagine how Sora will react when he learns she’s Marluxia/Lauriam’s sister!
I LOVE U NOMURA
4:04
OMG OMG OMG OMG
darkness ?
I can't believe it I'm shaking omg
THE G-FORCE IS REAL…. HOLY SHIT 😳😳
Just can't wait for Just a Pancake new video
what the fuck
Who scared Donald and Goofy at the end? Is that Hades?
Wtf is this real? 🥺😯
Please release KH missing link for the switch
I'm hoping 4 will be better than 3. 3 was terrible
It looks amazing... woah
Holy shit soo good
6:29 TENGEN TOPPA GURREN LANGAN REFERENCES LETSGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Better than I could have imagined
THEY ACTUALLY ANNOUNCED KH4?! 2 titles and the rest of "Dark Road", all in one day, that' a lot!
Hmm, I'll admit that I'm a bit skeptical about KH4 from this. Not in love with Sora's design or the realistic approach. Like I get it, it's a different world and we knew we'd get something like this from the Yozora thing. I'm just not sure that Sora really fits it the way someone like Yozora does. And if he's not going to fit the new aesthetic fully than I'd rather they didn't try halfway.  I guess what I'm saying is that I hope it doesn't take place for most of the game in Quadratum. I mean, we all winged about KH3 without any Final Fantasy, but I think it would be a lot worse with minimal Disney.  Of course these are early days and the other worlds are likely just not yet ready for display. I hope so, otherwise I might be relying on Yozora to keep me interested in this one. Nonetheless, I'm hopeful that the magic will still be there in this title.
Right I desperately need to get a PS5
YA KINGDOM HEARTS IV!! Can't wait for it to drop in 2030!!
Hooo boy Kingdom Hearts 4 see you in 2028
Am I blind or it looks like they reused the port royal model for the black coats?
I was here in the first hour!
I quite literally have lived my life alongside this franchise, this series. I'm only a month older than the first game, and I cannot believe how far it's come since. KH4 WILL come home when it's done, no doubt. What a beautiful trailer.
Strelitzia MY BABY!!!!  Nomura!! for the love of christ stop scrambling my brain and my heart!!!
I’m here at work and I’m having an INTERNAL MELTDOWN!!! New GAMES including KH4 🎉👀🎉💯😤🙏✨🙏💯 I had low/mid expectations for this event so this was a GREAT AWESOME, WONDERFUL surprise!!! 💖
OMG, are we FINALLY going to get Disney characters showing up outside their own worlds? Please fucking god Nomura!!
Kingdom Hearts 4 having the Final Fantasy 7 Remake graphics looks dope, and this is just the development footage it'll look absolutely stunning at the finish product. Hyped so much for the Lost Master arc.
I've been having this weird thought lately, like is this KH4 trailer for real? Or not...?
But please stop with that crazy shit of mobile
ストレリチア最高。。。
Guys, sora's outfit is the exact same as the artwork featured in KH 3 when you finish it in critical mode. This means that then that artwork, was a secret preview for KH 4.  Plus the characters in the artwork (roxas, Axel, Kairi and Riku), could have an important role in KH 4.  NOMURA I LOVE YOU, I WILL PATIENTLY WAIT FOR ALL THE ANNOUNCED GAMES.
Was I tripping or did we really see Strelitizia in the KH4 trailer? Hmmm that's going to be really interesting
KINGDOM HEARTS 4
NOT ME SQUEALING LIKE A DAMN BABY!!!!
twewy vibes already
Kingdom Hearts Multiplayer Nintendo Switch please!
WHAT THE FUCK I HAVE JUST WATCH :O
I was just thinking last night weres kingdom hearts 4! Never got around to playing Re: mind but I'll get on it asap.
is this kh 4 just ff versus 13 in disguise?
YO
LETSGO! KH4 HERE WE GO! HOPEFULLY NOT 10 YRS IN THE MAKING!
6:54 I could NOT see the V for the longest and could’ve swore it still said KINGDOM HEARTS 3 until I seen it on cynical page I’m dying laughing lol
El de moviles mejor para Nintendo switch!
IV ?!??!?!?! 😍😍😍 wanted a remake for 1.5/2.5 but still I'm happy
That was amazing. 😭  Also, was that...was that hades?
Is that Donald and goofy dealing with hades in the underworld?!
KH4: FALL 2030  Not before. Calm down guys 😂
God i love ALL of this. Only 1 issue.. Where's my boy Yozora! Haha
Hades at the end, AND STRELEZIA?? GIRL, YOU'RE ALIVE???
YESSU GUYS!!!! KH HYPE IS BACK!!! But hmmm a few things, I love the direction of the new dearly beloved of MISSING LINK!! previous dearly beloveds had various themes (Melody of memory = Jazz, 358/2 days = longing feel with flutes, 3D = orchestra) but missing link’s dearly beloved is like…a school orientation cheers? Kinda fitting since it takes place in the age where the dandelions are rebuilding the world after so much mistrust previously. Implementing a college team bonding cheer-like dearly beloved was a such a ingenious idea!
OUR BOY SORA GOT REGULAR LOOKING FEET NOW GUYS HYPE AF
Now we wait another 15 years till release 🙏
WHEN YOU WALK AWAY
CHEERS TO MANY MORE ADVENTURES
LETSGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
So 20 more years till its released?🤣
where riku
Not gonna lie, I legit thought that this was going to end with that Missing Link game. I wouldn’t have been surprised and I would’ve been fine with it, but I guess even they knew that would royally tick off the more hardcore fans.😆
Man, 2031 is going to be great
This is so amazing! The hype is real. Thank you Nomura, Square Enix and Disney!!
😍😍😍
Ah, seeing Sora once again fills my heart and joy. And the new game being set in Quadratum, I can only imagine how much the story progresses from here on out (still wanna see my boy Ventus again tho). Kingdom Hearts is BACK!🔥
WHAT, NO, IT’S TOO SOON, I NEEDED AT LEAST 4 YEARS OF MENTAL PREPARATION FOR THIS
Wait what? We don't have to wait 10 years for a sequel? This feels like.. HYPE!
When the first game came out…I was 11/12. I played & completed 1-3. Crazy how I’m 30 now. Long live KH. Im excited!!
Darkside got tires of being mocked i see.  KH IV LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
its amazing how to kingdom hearts looks like its slowly maturing as well in terms of story telling, like how its fan base is getting older with it.
I wonder what twists and turns we’ll see In Kingdom Hearts 4? But no doubt only time will tell soon enough
Is magic in the making another way to say in development. I really hoped we would get the game this year 😞
Please just don't make the shovel ware IOS games canon again
Let's just hope this doesn't take another decade to be released!
I hope we have final fantasy characters in this one and many worlds!!
Donald and Goofy went to the Underworld to ask help from Hades, them he appeared and attack them!!! Oh my god!!
Omg the Nvidia leaks were right!!!,?
*NOMURA TE COMO LOS HUEVOS*
LFG!!!!
STRELITZIIAAAAAAA!!! Omg, I can't believe she's actually alive!
In germany we say: Kingdom Hartz 4
Finally 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
kh mobile game looks neat but my phone cant run that shit  please consider a pc or ps4 release
I hope kh4 for 2024 but I wouldn't be strange to be reselease in more years later
I thought he was Yozora but then i remembered the color of the eyes and I realised he was Sora!!!
Why didn't sora look like this in kh3? He looks WAAAAAY more mature now like he did in kh2
Another mobiel game? Realy Square?  not anyone has a mobile that good that they can play so much games on it.   And as much as the hype get me again, i dont know. The KH3 animation was already, too "real" for me. I liked the old grafic they had in KH2.  Now it looks realy, real. Sure it looks awsome. Reaöy reaöy awsome. But after KH3 and MoM, i´m skeptical.  If it comes to the story, that too. I dont realy like that they built up. After different worlds, time travleing, world of light and darkness and so one. They came now with parallel universes, the world of "fiction". I dont realy know what i should think about that. It is, too much in my eyes. The crossover of Final Fantasy and Disney were more then enouth.  But it now become more and more chaos in my eyes. Sure i follow and show what comes. But like i say. After KH3 and MoM, i´m skeptical.
time to survive pandemics and worldly disasters again to play KH4.
This...doesn't look like KH. Why are square games becoming more "realistic" and less fantasy? This looks more like a modern FF game, granted too early to say anything but mixed feelings on this. Was already massively disappointed in KH3...
Everyone STAY CALM... KINGDOM. HEARTS. FOUR. !!!!!!!!!!
cool
my dad gave me kingdom hearts 3 two years ago on my playstation. i never played it but now i picked it back up i love it so much its absolutely amazing to me.  i just need to ask my dad about KH4 😩
Well, how is strelitzia still alive I wonder, also darkside definitely looking more edgy this time around xD
Look at sora’ feet…
AHHHHHH OMG!! I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE!! TWO NEW GAMES!! THEY LOOK GOOOOOOOOD! I LOVE KINGDOM HEARTS!! SO GLAD I GOT TO SEE IT GROW! BEST DECISION TO PLAY IT AS A KID!! ♥
I’m shocked! I don’t know what to say but… WOW FREAKIN AMAZING!!! SPECTACULAR KINGDOM HEARTS 4!!!! TOO MUCH HYPE!!! SORA LOOKING MATURED TOO… OUR BOY SORRY YOUNG MAN GREW UP!!! HAPPY 20th ANNIVERSARY KINGDOM HEARTS 🖤🗝
Wtf kh4 really?
KH4 looks good. Loving that Sora has the ability to pierce the heavens.   Question is it going to be another 10 years before we get it and hopefully with how ps5s are that it'll also be on ps4.
Nomura is soooooo salty that they removed him from the FFXV project. “Fine, I’ll make my own FF game”
I had to double check today's date and make sure April Fool's had passed. KH4??????
So 2028 release
Okay hear me out, the person Donald and Goofy are talking to at the end is either Hades or Dr. Strange
Einfach nur krank!!!
Is that Hades at the end?
Oh… OH YES! Kingdom Hearts 4 confirmed!
Quadratrum is based on what happens when you challenge Disney's lawyers
This is it. The beginning of the second arc. I still think Sora looks weird in Kingdom Hearts IV, but whatever, I'll get used to it. Anyway, were Donald and Goofy just trying to get help from Hades or was that someone else?
😱😱
I can't man dudeee  no stop omg yes thank everything.. LOOK AT MY BOIIIII. LOOK AT HIS NORMAL FEET BRUH WE UNREAL ENGINE 5 IN HERE! LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!
Holy KH4 is so gooddd 😍
YUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!! THANK YOU!!!!
LET'S GO KH FANS THE TRAIN IS HERE !!!!
I'm happy KH IV got announced, but I'm afraid it'll be released in 3-5 years from now or even longer... I hope I'm wrong
INSANE
ABSOLUTELY LEGENDARY
I think the biggest mystery solved is that SORA HAS NORMAL SIZED FEET
May heart be your GUIDING KEY
definitely a PS6 & Xbox Xfactor 1 launch title
My god…. When I said I think the Disney worlds would be gone for 4, I didn’t actually imagine it would be that true wow… I’m so ready lol
See you all in 2035 for KHIV
fuck i'm so excited dude, PLEASE COME OUT SOON AND NOT IN LIKE 2050 :(
We love you NOMURA 😁😁😁
Is KH Missing Link going to be made in stop-motion and talk about a bounty hunter finding a talking gorilla?
Wow, I can't believe y'all letting Nomura trick you again after KH3. Getting invested, feeling excited. Can't wait to see him let you down again.
Let's fucking GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I'm so happy they're already onto it. I don't wanna wait another 15 years lmao.
What is the OST from the Dark Road?
I'm so used to so much filler titles that I wasn't expecting a direct sequel. This is great. 😅
I got goosebumps from the KH4 trailer!
normally I would be over the moon but the hype for kh3 killed me inside. :(
😍😍😍
Master of Masters : Morning 👋🏾
hey yo that cloud trophy tho.
完全にファイナルファンタジー化してて草
Super excited about KH4, but... No Steam port? Come on Square.
Geez I didn't think we be getting Kingdom Hearts 4 so soon LET'S GO!!!!!!!
OH MY GOD
i still can't believe this is real and how awesome it looks, I'm speechless!
WE ARE ALL GROWN UP
My only thing with this mobile game is I was DEDICATED for a while, but there were so many twists and updates that I couldnt catch up so even if I were maxed out and I was at a high level, I was still weak and lost every fight. Please slow the updates next time :’)
REALISTIC SORA LET'S GOOOOOOOO! I don't know how Akidearest will react to this
I REALLY CAN'T WAIT OMG IM SHAKINGGGGGGGG SO EXCITED
Lack of release date just tells me we'll be waiting a couple years for this 😥 hopefully the other games bring some nice story to watch to fill the wait.
Sora has aged & is a grown man now.
Man Sora became a Final Fantasy character
Holy……..
Another good day to be KH Fan :)
Awesome
Is that ue5?
Leeets go.
I can't believe Sans Undertale is in KH4  And god I hope they don't put NFTs in these
Dont frick this up Square enix, let the director focus at one game at the time, unlike with ffxv and kh3
Nice now we just have to wait 14 years for it to come out
Yeeessss!!!! Phase 2 is going to be wild on so many levels!
It would be amazing if we have the gameplay like that in KH4, hopefully it doesn't get nerfed like FF15
I thought this is banana was gonna play
YOU CAN SEE HIS FEET
Holy shit this was unexpected. I wasn't expecting to another kingdom hearts game so soon but I'm happy we are getting it.
Is Kingdom Hearts 4 gonna be on Nintendo Switch?
Giga Drill Breaker
at the end with Donald and Goofy i think that they are searching Sora in hell, and Hades ask them why they're here (because Hades don't know that sora disappear) 🤔
EXCUSEEE MEEEEEEE, SOMEONE IS GETTING RAISE
Is it seriously gonna be made by the b team again??? Too many qte
I CAN'T STOP REPLAYING THIS.
I see that they finally stopped trying to make sense.
These graphics look INSANE! This is a HUGE step forward for Kingdom Hearts and I am excited to be here to witness it! HYPEE!
YES!!!!
Strelitzia alive?!
I never thought I would see the day.
cant wait for the 30th annivesary to get maybe a release date
Its so werid seeing sora with average shoes
I can't believe I live in a world that has kingdom hearts 4 coming out before I'm 20. This is definitely a pre-order.
Why does sora look like noctis
Modern FF style Sora is *french kiss*. Really hope we get to see FF characters since they seem to be going down that route with KH4 and ‘Quadratum’.
LOOK AT OUR SON ALL GROWN UP!
Donald and Goofy are definitely looking for Hades because he is the god of death, so they hope he can give them answers. I love this disney envolvement in the plot (:
Amei esse finaaallll!! Que gráfico lindo!!!! 😍❤👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
YESSSSS
Seriously new art style.... Going for realism is trash
F*cking AMAZING!
So beautiful 😭😭😭
Why It dosen't have the cartoon style 🥲
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
we're gonna be seeing Magic in the Making for like 10 trailers now.
What a beautiful thing to wake up to 😩
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG !!!!!  JE RÊVE S'EST PAS POSSIBLE !!!! ಥ‿ಥ
I’m surprisingly more excited for what Donald and Goofy are doing. What if they’re in Olympus because they’re looking for Cloud or Auron? What if we actually get an adult Zack in KH Style?
Therapist: Realistic Sora isn’t real, he can’t hurt you. Realistic Sora:  Jokes aside, KH4 looks hype. Let’s just hope it doesn’t take another five years to come out.
holy fucking shit and i thought KH3 graphics couldn't get better
MAY YOUR HEART BE YOUR GUIDING KEY! 🗝
These are exciting times!
This giant Heartless has such a distinct hairstyle... Oh boy...Here comes the theories...  Welcome back Kingdom Hearts!
There's only one way to react  LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Dude I really woke up at 4AM for no reason and I was rewarded with a Kingdom Hearts 4 trailer for my terrible sleeping habits. I can’t believe this. Tearing up rn.
When KH3 ended I was like "OK.... I get it.... the game is short because the studio wants to move on from kh and they spent too much development time on it" then 4 gets announced..... Honestly... what was the point of kh3 been underwhelming..... if you planned more games?
CAN I CURSE??????????????? OH MY FUCKING GOOOOOOD THIS CANT BE HAPPENING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IM SO EXCITED WHATTTTTTT
What about disney lol. That gigantic heartless was just epic. 25th anniversary: Anime adaption?
Do you know when the 2 new games for coming out
OMG!!!😱🤯
Release date tho?
Yes, scrubs this is the Final Smash bros character and what a legendary addition he was.  That guy at the end is totally Hades from Hercules!!!!!
Is missing link a mobile game
Sora is stupid
The only thing that's upsetting me about this is that it's most likely gonna be on ps5 and I don't have one 😭😭😭
Need Steam release!
I can’t believe it.. is that Sora?!
im crying and laughing screaming feel like imma have a stroke I'm so EXCITEEED! Kingdom Hearts has impacted my life soo much and this here has made it that much more anazing!
KINGDOM HEARTS 44444444444444444444444444444444444444
Boo mobile game but that Dearly Beloved
at 6:29 is Sora doing a giga drill breaker?
Is that the EX Bar being back??? Pleaaaase Square, please make it happen
Nier replicant enemies looking ass Lmaooo Can't wait
I really hope that kingdom hearts 4 won't be bad like 3 was where it was unfinished.
I'm so hyped AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
The fact that there is always Olympus in the numbering title is an important world for Kingdom Hearts, isn't it? Google Translation
LESSSSSS GOOOO🔥
☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 KINGDOM HEARTS 4
KINGDOM HEARTS 4444
To quote Phil: I got 2 words for ya— absolutely insane trailer!!
OSWALD THE LUCKY RABBIT????
I'm TOO excited for this new chapter!!! It looks so epic and I feel like the series can really travel freely into new territories with everything Xehanort wrapped up.
Oh my god. The series isn't done yet.. im going to cry
What are the chances kh4 comes out in 5 years
O... My... God.... it's amazing!
OH HELLL YEAH HERE WE GOOOOOO!!!!!!
Please let Yoko Shimomura be the composure
I can't believe Kingdom Hearts 4 was announced so soon after 3! I thought we'd have to wait until, AT LEAST, 2026! I'm hoping we get worlds based on "The Incredibles", "The Princess And The Frog", "Zootopia", "Treasure Planet", "Aladdin And The King Of Thieves", "The Lion King 2" "The Avengers", "A Bug's Life", "Christopher Robin", "Atlantis: The Lost Empire", "Kim Possible", "Star Wars", and "Inside Out".
Wait.. are they visiting Hades lord of the Underworld in order to try and get Sora/anyone else back from the other dimension?
This could be a chance to redeem yourselves for giving us KH3 15 years later  Please don’t mess this up!
MY WEEK IS MADE. I AM VIBRATING IN MY SEAT. HOLY COW THE HYPE
That reference to XIII with Sora going through a building huh? Im onto you Nomura
SO EXCITED!!! THANK YOU NOMURA!!!! #KHIV
Wait is that Hades in the end?
Definitely predicting the release date for Kingdom Hearts 4 04/04/2024 it really makes sense for this game to drop within two to 3 years
Damn so Donald and Goofy are trying to ask Hades about how they can get Sora back from Unreality?
You either die a Disney character or live long enough to become a Final Fantasy character
AAAAAAAAAAAAH I'M SO EXCITED
Was that Hades in the End?
Kingdom Hearts 4 Sora looks so mature and grown up and I'm all in for it. This franchise is what keeps me going through my day. Thank you!
Donald and goofy were looking for hades
Good god this is gonna be INSANEEEEEE
K...  King... Kingdom Hearts 4 ??  Oh my god... I'm in tears right now 😭  I've been waiting this since I finished KH 3...  Thank You Nomura-san 🙏🏻 !
What the fuck!!! I can’t believe this shit.
PORCODIOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Sora's hair should be spikey it looks weird with it not
Oh Hey Sora's Shoes are normal now!
The hype is too real rn. A final fantasy KH game.
nomura really wants us to play versus xiii huh? looking forward to it.
Is that Bruni at the end :)
well, I wouldn't expect this Release on PS4🙂😌
Love the kingdom hearts 4 announcement, even if it looks too much like final fantasy. Hate the mobile trash though.
This has truly made my entire week, I am so excited for new Kingdom Hearts! The graphics look stunning, was the nature shots all created because that looked like real life and I am just amazed. Gonna rewatch and cry again I think
See you guys in 13 years where Nomura is having a ganja time deciding which FF characters are supposed to be in the game
TRUST NO “GAMEPLAY”
Let's go!  Honestly didn't believe we'd get a KH4 trailer
Damn KHIV makes KHIII looks like childs play..
Woah,slow down there buddy, not so fast
Now's a GREAT time to be a Kingdom Hearts fan!!!!
kH 4. Sora became Noctis
WHO ARE DONALD AND GOOFY LOOK FOR?!
Watching this gave me goosebumps! Kingdom Hearts has always been my favorite game series been playing it since it came out and to have watched it evolve into watch it is now is amazing! Loved how the games grew with us over the years! I'm so excited for what's to come!
WHAT THE STRELETZIA! (I don't know if it's right) WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE
I JUST CAN’T!…. 😱😱
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT BABYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!
FLOATY NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD
So damn excited now  The last man must be Hades
next gen exclusive.
I really want to play the upper version kingdom heart Like kingdom heart 3, DLC, and other But the only console that i have is Playstation 2 And i can't buy any other console even a computer
OMG OMG ITS HAPPENING!!!! LETS GO KH4!!!!!!!
This is the next step in Kingdom Hearts, and this is only the beginning. The Oath to return and he came back strong.
LETS GO BOIIS! Actual numbered sequel!
I'm gonna pass out!!!
why does missing link have to be a mobile game :(
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO STRELITZIAAAAA
7:18 is that.. HADES?!?!
This looks pretty bad. Especially that terrible scripted gameplay.
Whoa, I get that lore-wise the character design shift makes sense but man is it trippy lol
KH4 Looks sick! I'm glad Donald & Goofy are still around. 😭😭
when you think that a worse KH cannot exists after the third one...oh god.
If Donald and Goofy make it there, they're just going to be an actual Dog and a Duck.
My lord Nomura
Kingdom Hearts IV 👑🔥
See u in 5 years (again..)
LIKE IS ANY OF THIS FOR REAL OR NOT!!!! AHHHHHHHHHH
I'm so confused yet loved this so much, sums up Kingdom Hearts tho
I said I felt like a kid in a candy store.
IVが出るまではミッシングリンクを楽しんで待つとしますか！
Square Enix.... please this time... the japanese dub for the worldwide release, not only the english ! Why KH is the only game who doesn't have Japanese dubbing in the West ? Even your minor games have it.
IT'S LOOKS SO GOOD!!!!!!!!! OH MY GOD!!! I'M SO GLAD WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER DECADE TO PLAY THE NEXT MAINLINE GAMES!!!! YEAH BABY!!!!!!!!!!!! LET'S GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AHHHHHHH
2025 if were lucky
The graphics for IV look gorgeous!!! I am now even more hyped for this than I already was!!!!
I wonder who donald and goofy are looking for at the end? Herc again?
Thank you so much Nomura, I am in tears right now because just look at that kingdom hearts 4 trailer ommmmg 😭😭 Take as long as you need for his one! I can tell it’s gonna blow KH3 out the water! And thank you to the fans you’re all amazing the love we all have for this series has gotten us this far!! So thank you all!! 🙏🏾
Hades at the end I'm pretty sure
Wow this is going to be interesting can’t wait 🔥🔥🔥🔥
THERE IS NO WAY
Take my money
This is too much for me, too much hype man
KH4 looks interesting, the mobile games however 🤮
THE HYPE ITS HAS TAKEN OVER!!!!!!!! LETS GOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! LOOKING FORWARD TO THE WAITING AGAIN!!!!!!
THE TURKEY HAS BEEN RESURRECTED I REPEAT THE TURKEY HAS BEEN RESURRECTED, goddamn it is at this point that I am happy to be dedicated to kingdom hearts as a series CAUSE GODDAMN THAT DEARLY BELOVED DURING MISSING LINKS IS SLAPPING. BELIEVE AND QUADRATUM LOOKS AMAZING also sora feet reveal finally now we can see if it is his feet or just his oversized shoes!!!!!!!
i literally cried we are all screaming bruh im so proud of square like my mouth is still open LMAO
Curse my horrible sleeping schedule also I’m beyond excited kh future looking bright as hell!!!
KINGDOM HEARTS 4 LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!!
KINGDOM HEARTS 4 AHHHHHHH!!! I CRIED
I don't know how to feel about the new artstyle but at the same time I can't wait to see and hear more information about this game, KH4 is here!
THE HYPE IS REALLLLLLLLL!!!!!! I NEED MORE!!!!
Increible 😍😍😍😍😍
NOCTIS WHERE ARE YOUUU
I hope cloud and sephiroth joins kingdom hearts IV one day as it would be awsome to see them again, but I am very excited for KH IV
This was disappointing. The visual aesthetic of quadratum was unappealing. I won’t say anything about how sora looks because he’s always looked different when traveling to new worlds. Everything up until sora was boring phone bullshit everyone said they don’t want. I only got excited with what ever donald and goofy were doing. More of that shit please!
Kingdom Hearts 4, can't wait 😍❤️
HYPE!!!!!
Thanks
Make it into nfts
Holy shit Holy shit Holy shit Holy shit!!!!!!!
This shit looks *IMMACULATE!!!*
Trailer 1: Cutscenes of a failed interim game. Trailer 2: An actual interim game. Trailer 3: A game that looks like it should be an interim game, but is actually a mainline game. Trailer 4: Probably an interim game.
please say sike
I just hope that Quadratum is only one world in KH4, bc that realistic art style does not suit the series.
OMG OMG OMG HYPE I can't even describe it
Troppo figooo
THIS IS IT! LOOK AT MA BOI, LOOK AT THIS WORLD! EVERYTHING IS 10/10 ALREADY!!!
YO SORA FEET PICS LETS GO!!!
1:27 so true Xehanort
Ahhhhhh😳😳😳
It all looks so damn amazing! Cant wait to see more. Great work so far!
KH FANS EATING A BUFFET RN
just  hypii
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
if u guys make kh4 EPIC EXCULUSIVE ı gonna beat you all and you guys never gonna be walk again
WHAAAAAT WAS THAAAAAT? AM I DREAMING? OMG!
KINGDOM HEARTS♥️
6:16 Holy S*it, why does it feels like FFvs13 before it became FFXV ..?! Nomura, you genius !!!
"If this isn't the ending you desired--if it brings you despair--then leave this world for another." THEY KNEW WE DIDN'T WANT THAT ENDING!!!
I love kingdom hearts!!!!!
From seeing this game first on the GBA to now its just amazes me on how far we've come in video games in general this looks so fleshed out hella hyped for this!
They done put Sora in real life
What have I just witnessed Give me a Black Box edition
Older sora looks like roxas / ventus and noctis. Well it's makes sense with those two
No way this is real. I know it's on the official channel but no way this is real.
Nice ❤️😎
i need to relax. im too shook from this.
Seriously this is the most excited i’ve been for a game in a while. Kingdom hearts is the best game/game series i’ve ever played. Grew up with the games so i’m so excited
KINGDOM HEARTS 4!!!!!!!! STO MALE, GRAZIE GRAZIEEEEE
Is that Sora or just a cosplayer?
I'm so happy for a new sequel but... I was at least hoping for an announcement for the KH collection to come to Steam
The darkside heartless looks like a demon and I love it. I cannot wait to play all of these games.
Oh yeah baby, THE HYPE TRAIN STARTS!
THIS WAS AMAZING!!! THAT KH4 TRAILER MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS DREAMING!!!!! OMG!!!!
AAHAHAHAHSJDJDRN OH MY GODDDD. SORAAA! HE REALLY DID WEAR SKINNY SHOES 😭😭✨✨
LET'S FUCKING OGGPOGGGIOPOOOOO
Holy shitttt
AHHHHHHHHHH 😱😱😱😱😱😱
Holy... Sora looks so much older! This has me so hyped!!!
Ngl I had no idea that said IV I was confused as hell
kingdom hearts 4! no way! just no way!!!!
Sure KH story was already wild but if the theories are right (which this trailer more or less confirms) things are about to get even wilder
OMFG IM SO DAMN HYPED!!!! KH4, SORA AND STRELITZIA?? My mind is blown. It looks so beautiful. Also, wonder why Hades is so pissed at the end xD
NOMURA, YOU MADMAN!
KINGDOM HEARTS LETSSSS GOOOOOOOO
I'M CRYING 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This feels like a fever dream.
I could care less about the mobile game, however I’m really excited for kingdom hearts four. I was really worried for Sora there for a little bit. Hopefully they go back to the Disney worlds art- as I don’t see how goofy and Donald would look in the final fantasy art format
Thank you ❤️😭😭😭😭
I AM SCREAAAAMING
I'm cautiously optimistic for KH IV. Everything else I don't care about. I still want a Kairi game that isn't a whatever Melody of Memory was.
REAL
THANK YOU SO MUCH 🙇🏻‍♀️🙌🏻😭😭😭❤️
This is too much, I'm gonna cry 😭 KH4 probably isn't coming out for another 5-10 years (being generous here, let's be real), but god is it looking fun
I’m LOSING MY MIND!
LET’S GOOOOOOOOO
Was that...... Hades?.... again?... man they really love Olympus
Kingdom Hearts 4 yessssssssss! I wish I can see it soon! I AM SCREAMING RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!
OMG, now we know what Soras shoes contains! His feet! normal shoes too! holyyyyyyyy hahahah
Sora looks uncanny but it is in development.
Yeah!  Kingdom Hearts IV officially announced
Man I love this series so much. Everything here did not disappoint one bit. Missing-Link looks sick it's what Union Cross should of been.  Kingdom Hearts 4 omg where to even begin. It looks absolutely stunning  Happy 20th Anniversary Kingdom Hearts here's to another 20
Yesssssss! Waking up to this made my day. I can’t wait. Oh my god!!
Square please stop it with your mobile games 😭
This is insane!!!! Kingdom hearts 4 with this art style is wild, I am so excited
BROOOOOOOOOOOOO
Already pumped to see 4 in English and hear the new voices
Kingdom Hearts.
I'm crying
Kingdom Hearts 4 though :D
Let's get this to number 1 trending, THE HYPE IS SO REAL.
Porca madonnaaaaaaaaaa
キングダムハーツ4楽しみ!!
SORA WITH REGULAR HUMAN FEET???!!!?
Im so happy ty square enix
amazing
This is AMAZING!! I have to catch up playing the games up til this point!
Screaming crying throwing up
Oh man, my hands are shaking a little. How exciting is this!! Happy Anniversary Kingdom Hearts and thank you so so so much for this!
KINGDOM HEARTS 4!!!! LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
WHAHHAAHHAHAHHAHjcnidjTTT
I'm so excited for Kingdom Hearts 4! My best friend unfortunately passed away without clearing Kingdom Hearts 3 but I know she would have been excited for this!
I was holding my tears in the kh4 teaser omg
Y’all I cried so much
THIS GAME LOOKS INCREDIBLE!!! Sora got a hair style change, and new shoes! Lol namine looks really nice too! This is is so lifelike! Can’t wait to see what happens as the game develops!! Haven’t been this hype for a while!! LETS GOOOO!!! It’s been quite a ride the past 20 years. Here here for more!
Man, I might seriously be having a heart attack over here
I am absolutely speechless. The future doesn't scare me at all <3
Kh4 is looking sick! Take all the time you need I will wait for this masterpiece
My only hope for this games is for ( and I know some will disagree hardcore with this) stars wars to be a world  The Nobodies ship Gummi Mission in KH2 was just star wars anyways yknow. But imagine having Sora, Donald and goofy explore the Death star dressed as stromtroopers  ( you don't need any of the main characters to show up imo)  Imagine fighting Darth Vader in a KH game that would be amazing
ITS HAPENNING OMG AAAAAAAAAA
This is incredible. Like holy shit
This has to be one of the happiest moments in my life. This is so surreal oh my god.
Dude I was expecting like spin off kh games maybe a Disney plus announcement. But holy shit I did not expect Spoiler   KINGDOM HEARTS 4 🤯🤘
Holy fucking shit dude this looks amazing!!!!
O dios...por favor que el kingdom hearts 4 termine también saliendo en el ps4
Yooooooooooo! Sora on Quadratum? With Strelitza???? Hellooooooooo??? And the finale chapter for dark road would be on my birthmonth!! This is so hype as fk!!
Kingdom Hearts on the Steam Deck 💙
Finally it’s finally here kingdom hearts 4 long live  kingdom hearts  May your heart be your guiding key
Great! See you in 2028 when it comes out!
Nomura still salty regarding versus till this date if the last one is any indication guys🤣
I loved everything but seeing Donald and goofy really made me happy glad to know they’re still gonna be in the next game
I ACTUALLY CANT BELIEVE IT looks awesomeeee
Kingdom Hearts has been ruining SE games for 20 years now. I wish Nomura had gotten sacked instead of Sakaguchi back in the day and maybe the company would still have a bit of style left in its games. Alas, here we are.
Nice but it's just me or it something weird about Sora's face?
I am here for all of it
Did they just kill Donald and goofy?
Kingdom Hearts 4.... WOW So the hype begins..👏🏽🔥
What a day for kingdom hearts! Unreal
YAY! Final Fantasy versus XIII! I can't wait!
too bad kh 3 was ass
Yo someone ask nintendo to add KH4 sora to smash right now
ONE OF THE BEST DAYS OF MY ENTIRE LIFE. YES.
THIS IS NOT A DRILL. WE HAVE CONFIRMATION ON A KH4! Seriously, this makes me so happy. This franchise and series of characters will always be close to heart.
OH MY GOOOOOOD I CAN'T WAIT OHKGDGLDTOETIDMJFHLZTISKHCNVJHLFKGGKEHKDGKDJFSIFSUF
I can‘t wait for the 8 spin-offs explaining the story between KH3-4 and Kingdom Hearts 3.81 releasing alongside Kingdom Hearts 3.5 Remix. <3  Best story of all time!!
You know the KH4 footage kinda reminds me of something...
Let's go my fellow keyblade wielders!!!!!! ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
zzz
STRELITZIA!!!
I am so excited for waht's to come May your heart be your guiding key. Thank you
I've been having weird thoughts lately (more like now) Like is any of this for real or not? (Cause this is just to damn Exciting)
Congratulations to the GOAT Tetsuya Nomura and to each individual fan for the past 20 years!   The future looks bright!
Kingdom Hearts 4.....KINGDOM HEARTS 4, AM I DREAMING? OR AM I SO FREAKING HYPED FOR IT? LESSSS GOOOOOO
Was that Hades at the end?
Yes ! Yes ! YES ! Some news !!!
HYPEEEEE!!!!!
Now please let this be the excuse to have square enix worlds
Honestly, I was very disappointed with the story aspect of kingdom hearts 3 but this looks really promising!
Man I wish they told us what system Kingdom Hearts 4 will be on. PS5? Xbox Series X? Come on Square Enix, tell me!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nicob is probably questioning reality like the rest of us after that last trailer
Looks like we're finally getting Versus XIII.
Hypeeeeee
How cool, I used to always play KH on sundays to boot! How serendipitous :)s
KH4 ANNOUNCEMENT AAAAHHHHHHH
bruh momento
Absolute chills can't wait for KH 4
Sora got his shoes on incredibly fast
dadmelo todo pa LLEVAAAAAAAAAR
I cannot put into words how excited i am, KH1 was the first video game i played and have grown up alongside the series. This is truely something magical, Kingdom Hearts is everything to me
DAMN, I got goosebumps all over my body...
For sure that was Hades at the end. Unless...
I can't wait for this!
OK, I swore to myself that after Kingdom Hearts 3 I would be done with the series. But after seeing this, I might reconsider and give this another shot.
*i might to play this series again* hmmmmmmmmm
AHHHH OMG THERE WAS STRELITZIA😭😭😭 or alteast someone who looked like her qwq
I am a grown ass man crying over this right now.
KH4 IS FINALLY HAPPENING!!!😄⭐️👍✨💫🌠🗝
The future is lay bear for all to see. Rejoice, for it seems bright.  Mobile not really to hyped for if I'm honest, the added lore is welcome though. Kh4 being announced is great and looks absolutely amazing.  Though I'm sure it'll be quite some time before we'll see it. 2023 to 2025 MAYBE. But who knows.  Though who was that at the very end with Donald and Goofy?
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!
Until the next 10+ plus years. See you until then
At this point I refuse to believe that anything great will come out of this series since the fuckfest that 3 was... Still gonna keep an eye on 4 though just in case.
Being a die hard fan of Kingdom Hearts I and II, It is difficult to be excited about this after the disappointment Kingdom Hearts III was, but we will see how this turns out.
Kingdom hearts IV
Sora goes to the real world, dude
I Hope Kingdom Hearts IV Might Have Meet the Robinsons World and Star Wars World.
HYPE IS REAL!!!! I LOVE KINGDOM HEARTS♥️♥️♥️♥️
PLEASE FOE THE LOVD OF GOD do not make this games development as long as KH3 😅
my stupid brain is still in doubt iS THAT SORAA???!?!?!?
OMG😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 SO HYPED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😱😱😱❤️❤️❤️ #KH4😭😭
I soo want this game now
So happy This is one of the Best Ramadan gift we can get this year
I'm kinda worried about the art style of Sora. It makes me think they'll be using live action Disney remake movies in this one.
I wanna scream so bad
What the hell was going on whaaaat omg yesssssss
KH4 wont come out until 2025 yo
Today is a good day my fellow KH fans fuckkkkk, 24 years of age and this shit still aint gotten old. Gonna do an entire KH play thru leading up to kh4. Much love to all the fans and everyone in this beautiful community!
Older Sora seriously looks like the Noctis Nomura wanted. THIS. IS. IT
OMG!!!!! IV!!!!!!!!
Wow, KH4!? I can see that being a 2025 game now
My life is complete
AAAAAAAAAAAA
I can already tell by how sora looks and the world he's in that this is gonna be a huge leap forward in what kingdom hearts can be and I can't wait to see it all unfold.
Can't wait for KH4 to come out!!!!
Holy crap look at sora he’s now an adult
Wow. Just. Wow
Wow I’m hyped
Kingdom hearts 4!!!
Finally some new content😭😭 and my boy Sora😭😭 Can't wait to play all of it😭😭😭 KH4😎
YES YES YES YES YES  Y E S.
There is another Disney character who uses blue flame: Bill Cypher
May our hearts be our guiding key 💞
Omfg kingdom hearts 4 let's go
KINGDOM HEARTS 4!!!!!
not a fan of the art style in quadrantum if I can be honest. but still hyped
It’s FUCKING LITTTTTTTTT
Well shit, time to play all the games again
AS THE LOCAL KHUX SIMP MISSING LINK IS GIVING ME L I F E
7:17 IT'S THE GHOST LIGHT!!!  Cars in Kingdom Hearts 4?
It's hades right?????
Didn’t think Hades would be essential to the plot
they didn't show a release date for kh4, and I honestly am very happy about that for some reason.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
KH 4 BOYS LET’S FUCKING GO!!!!
OMG KINGDOM HEARTS 4 IS F**KING REAL THANK YOU NOMURA!! 😭🙏🏾
I didn’t except to see kh 4 this year that’s hype
Impresionante kingdom Hearts IV y que pasó en Scala caelum
AAAAAAAH I'M SCREAMING!!!!! KH FANS WE EATING!!!!
Was the one at the end Hades?
OMG!! KH4 HYPE!!!
This is the hypest shit of all 2022
I am so flipping happy right now! Kingdom Hearts IV is COMING!! Missing Link looks great too!
Wait I was not prepared for this yet!
OMG IM SO HYPED IT LOOKS AMAZING ITS REAL I CANT BELIEVE IT WOW  I smiled throughout the whole thing. KH4 and the mobile game look so good wow.
I'm excited. I just hope i'm not forced to play the mobile games to understand KH4
I have literal tears in my eyes oh my god
IS this fake?
HAPPY 20TH ANNIVERSARY TO THE KINGDOM HEARTS FRANCHISE!!!❤❤❤❤😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
If feels good to be back on the hype train with you guys
Gacha aja awas lu ye!. Wkwkkw
Broooo what did I just watch
THIS IS INSANE
No se va a ver así ni de coña
He's still salty about ffvsxiii I see, he's turned Sora into Noctis.
That mysterious blue flame at the end...Is Hades going to get a bigger role and be outside his world? (Other than Hollow Bastion in KH1) If so, that's insane, but welcome. I loved how the Fairy Godmother played a role in ReMind and MoM. More Disney stuff being important really helps with the whole crossover aspect of the series.
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE!!!!!!!!!!!!
KH4?!! WHAT IN THE HELL DID I JUST WITNESS??? OMG I'M SO HYPED! LONG LIVE KINGDOM HEARTS! ❤
Bro this is insane, I ain't get goosebumps for a game in a while, we did it bois we're finally onto the 2nd phase of this amazing franchise.
So im assuming Donald and Goofy are trying to use the underworld to reach wherever Sora is since that very obviously has to be Hades with the blue fire
Every game in this video looks unfinished as fuck
F ME IN THE EYES
When that IV appeared, I got the same level of uncontrolled hype and anticipation when the 1st Kingdom Hearts trailers came out for the original PS2 release. Nomura you spoil us with that next gen tease.  Damn it sure does feel amazing as a long time Kingdom Hearts fan!  Dem chills from that signature orchestral music.💕
Nomura legit said “fuck it I’m making kh into versus 13, who’s gonna stop me?”
Donald and Goofy got roasted.
Wow. I can’t believe we got a look at Kingdom Hearts 4. And look at Sora. He looks so different. I’m losing my mind.
Omfg I screamed at KH4, guessing my cat waking me up was a good thing lol 🔥
Right when I think I'm done Nomura pulls me back in dammit 😭😭😭
IM SCREAAAMIIINNGGGGG
OH MY GOD, KINGDOM HEARTS 4!
FUCK YESSSS, THEY ARE AMBITIOUS WITH THIS!!!
7:17 HEREEEEEEEEEEEEE'S HADES!!!
Kh4 omg
Oh yeah GTA san quadrantum
I’ve never been so HYPED before in my life, thank you Tetsuya Nomura and everyone of the developers for your hand in making this masterpiece of a series
🔑キングダムハーツ大好き🔑
Those graphics and our girl Sterlitiiza ahhhh!!!
JESUS FINALLY AND GOSH THE CHILLS IN THE KH 4 TRAILER TvT
yoo sora looking drippy
I want to play Kingdom Hearts 4 now 😍😍♥️♥️🔥🔥
KINGDOM HEARTS 4 Comfirmed!!!! I thought i had wait until i'm an old man for this game. Thank You!!!! :)
Everyone is sleeping on Hades having an important role? Is that even hades?
SANS????
I litarally am crying Right now
LETSSSSSS GOOOOOOO
We out here baby 🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏 Let’s go!!!!
Is this for real, or not? OMG
HOOOOLYYYY
Oh my f-ing god… (sorry for the language) but what did I just watch???!!! Can’t this come any sooner!!!
YOOOOOOOOOOO
KINGDOM HEARTS IS THE GREATEST SERIES TO EVER BE CONCEIVED BY MAN!! LET'S FUCKING GOOOO!!! ❤️💙💚
Ok so who’s buying my kh4??
When
Nomura really said "You fucked up my Final Fantasy, so I'll just make it in Kingdom Hearts" huh
Sora Donald and goofy are all back I wounder how is the blue flame is a dragon 🐉
WOW, THIS IS INSANE!  NOMURA, THANK YOU!    THIS GOT ME ALL FLIPPED UPSIDE DOWN
the mobile games looked like hot garbage but kh4 seems interesting to say the least
KH4 SORA LOOKS!!!
So sora matured and he will create his new keyblade in the new world. Interesting
I just dropped to my knees at walmart
When I said there would be a KH4 teaser, I freaking called it! The game took itself to a next level and now we in modern day Tokyo. 😁
I can't its too much I JUST CAN'T...  It looks too good, this is too much for my poor heart. OUR BOY GREW UP SO MUCH! I know what I'm going to do after my finals, it looks just... undescribable!
OH MY GOD IT'S HAPPENING :')
The fact that one of my favorite female characters is in this world with Sora and they’re both realistic instead of the cartoon style man oh man boys and girls shit as a 25yr old this game is like a family member that I hold dear atp
Too much all at once
Chills throughout my entire body, we ain't ready 💯
Sora’s character model for KH IV looks more and more like Final Fantasy Versus art. I wonder if it’s because of Quadratum…
I'M SCREAMING
I get the gist of all of this except for the blue flame
let's go ♥
VERSUS 13 LET'S GOOOO
I’m super excited to play this game when it comes out
やっっっっば
MAROOO
its 4am and im literally shaking im so excited for kh4!!
Let’s fucking gooooo! I wasn’t expecting that. I knew something told me to stay up tonight. I felt it in my gut.
Holy crap
KH4 looks so weird lol, wtf was that.  it'll be interesting to see what that was about
Can’t wait to play KH4 in the year 2030
WOW THIS IS VERRRYYY VERRRYYY VERRRYYY COOL I LOVE IT SO MUCH
I'm still trying to comprehend everything I just saw
Did this just happen? Is this real? I’m having an out of body experience
Nice, see u all in 8 years when the game is out
Sora is horrible
Kingdom hearts 4 hype. Wonder if it's next gen only hmmm
LETS GO. YYEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH.
KH IV! Can't wait for it!
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Quadratum.... Land of the Death.
PLEASE CHANGE SORA'S CHARA DESIGN
KH4 IS A THING AHHHH
i hope we can customize an avatar like we did in khchi and khux :). im super excited for whats to come
OH MY GOD!!!!!! YOOOOOOO!!!! KINGDOM HEARTS 4!!!!! SORA IN QUADRATUM!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't like at all this realistic aesthetic.
This switch in art direction is sending me to space. I loved it.
HOLY MOLY IT IS HAPPENING YA'LL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Okay…chills. That realistic heartless. Wow.   Also…wondering who Donald and Goofy are meeting with. Seems like a guy with fire )clearly XD )
OH MY GOSH…
It makes me extremely uneasy seeing Sora go from looking anime to looking realistic, and it’s probably going to look even stranger standing next to Donald and goofy
Was that teasing hades at the end ? Blue flame turning red?
Sora got reversed isekai
I think I could cry tears of joy
HOLY FUUUUUCK
THIS IS EPIC 🔥😭
Put sho minamimoto from twewy in kh4
I hate the effects in KH3, everything looked more realistic in KH2. I mean if you want to hit the enemy with the Keyblade it doesn't really look like you're going to hit the enemy. Everything looks so artificial in KH3.
I'm getting a bad uncanny valley from that last trailer
I'M CRYING SO HARD
I'm so excited!!!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO
Kingdom hearts trailers will always get me hype man
YOOOOOOOO
What did I just watch!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh hello, edgy version of Kingdom Hearts
Now THIS is beautiful for sure! Here's to 20 years y'all🍾🍾🍾
Omg!!!
You madman.... He's doing versus within kh..... I love it!!
I'm ready for this. I hoping it's more like 2 than 3 tho
Holy shit another kingdom hearts trailer that made me all misty eyes. This series is amazing. Can't wait for kingdom hearts 4!!
My brother who passed away in 2014 showed me this series as a kid. i love this series so much and cannot wait to see the future of kingdom hearts for both of us 💙
OHMYGODD WHAT HAPPENED TO SORA'S PANTS????!??
oh my god
OH MY FUCKING GOD
7:17 Hades. My theory. But OH MY GAWD ITS ALL BEAUTIFUL
Straight Up HEAATTTT
kingdom hearts 4 oh shiiiiiit
Kingdom hearts is back in the light!!!
Revealed on 10th of April, does it have to do with Sora being stranded on the 104 building in Shibuya (battle vs yozora)? 10/4
YOOO OH GOD

We're all excited for this anniversary event. More Lore and Stories. And some plot twist. Good Luck Keyblade Wielders. "May Your Hearts Being Our Guiding Key"
