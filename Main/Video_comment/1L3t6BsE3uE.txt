Sweet little swimming pool with no water xx
I love Olive and Mabel.  I had successive yellow and black Labs, so I feel like I have a vested interest in their happiness.
Brilliant!!
The juice and smoothie bar 😂😂😂😂😂
You can watch these a year or so after the first time and they just get better..! The way the dogs sit there for minutes on end staring at Mr. C. Wonderful to see. Also looked again at the 3 of them " playing " cards....! They age like good wines.
Absolutely refreshing video!! Thank you so much 😅😊
Love this !! Brilliant. They are so cute and you are amazing with them.
So fantastic.
i know i'm late but these are fukkn hilarious
Well, it’s New Years resolution time again. Will Olive & Mabel keep up their workouts and catch the squirrels? 😄
🤣
😂
Fascinating 😅
All the sticks lined up against the wall, lol.
Dogs 🐶 make the world a better place ❤️
🤣🥰🤣🥰
Always a joy
Nothing on YouTube makes me as happy as this❤
I wanna join!😊
COVID lockdown would be good with these girls.
Oh how I love these dogs
Where have you been all my life. I am in love!
😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
Fantastic work it brings a smile to me with every video ladies, an keep up the good work Andrew
Somehow I missed this 3 years ago. But the humor is timeless. 😊
Still hilarious after all this time. Olive’s patience was wearing thin: Enough already get to the end of this and hand over that ball.
Fabulous,
❤oh wat fantastic dogs you have. If. Every I need a laugh or something to cheer me up I look 👀 at these.2  I live in the middle of the 😊 Fells. Used to lots of walking up them . But am disabled now. And takes me 10 mins to walk about 250yards please give them a bonio each for me. X
I would always take the yogurt classes.
Such cuties! ❤😂😊
The selection of sticks neatly arranged on the rack killed me😂
Platinum package all the way!!! 🦴🐾💕🤣🤣🤣
Maybe, someday, I will run into you. That would be fun. All my do does is “Squirrel” ….Serioussly, though, I love your humour. I will spell it, your way so the dogs understand. Love your channel!
It never ceases to make me smile and laugh
😂😂😂
Pure genius.
wonderful, you really make my day, love you all. thank you.
😂😂😂
A. Cotter, ur running commentary is the best comedy.  There isn;t a show with you and Mable and Olive I wouldn;t watch doing anything or nothing.  ur brillant and cute and funny
Can’t beat Mabel’s wagging tail!
If I could like these a thousand times I would.
No matter how many times I watch this, it makes me laugh out loud- the brilliant commentary along with the most beautiful Olive and Mabel- thank you!
😂😂😂
Revisiting, love to the family 👋
Darling!
😂 thank you, Andrew!  Please thank Olive and Mabel too❤️❤️❤️
Sign me up for the silver
I love rewatching these!
Ha ha ha…Lovely.  ❤
Mr Cotter is so creative!!
Happy New Year! Hoping for another joyous filled one with Mr. Cotter, Olive, and Mabel! 😊
They are so beautiful!
Mabel is in the pool chillin. 😂
We don't have a juice or smoothie bar set up for our pack after their runs....we think now, we may have to up our game!!
lol....Did I just spot the slightly torn cloth rabbit? Star of earlier clips :)
Excellent!  Platinum it is!  😂
Brilliant. I did actually laugh out loud at the ‘standard rack’ of sticks!
“A bit of housekeeping...” 😂
So so cute Olive and Mabel:).
Oh Mabel. Not a single thought going on in there ❤
I thought you were amazingly professional here Andrew, so good you should be on the telly, until I figured out where I knew that voice from. In my defense, I don't live in the UK and haven't for nigh on 30 years. The case for the prosecution is that I do watch a lot of rugby highlights.
"An hour of downward dog.."   I laughed till I cried.
I love the little tail wag when Mabel is in the pool.
I just love these videos, they cheer me up in a sad world. Please make more.
“…it is just a bucket and hose…I’ll grant you that.” LOL.
I hurt myself laughing, i really did "Your basic silver package £100 a month, that's basically just me holding a biscuit in front of your nose on a treadmill" LMFAO
Thank you for posting these delightful videos.  I think we all need something to smile about these days and Olive and Mabel are winners for me!  ❤️🐾🐾❤️
Just Brilliant
Olive and Mabel as a slightely vacant look this time😊
So clever. I love the spa...
I just love, love the dogs. I had a yellow lab.years ago and still miss her,these videos remind me so much of all the fun we had. She was my best buddy after my husband died, we did therapy visiting at a nursing home and they all knew the dogs name ( Abby) but not mine.
Harmony Spa!!!....just love it x
I fell off the side of the bed when you showed the sticks, seriously you Scot’s and your no warning ⚠️ sense of humour.  Mable and Olive if you need any help to break up that Platinum Package. Lawyers for Dogs 🐕 will help. 🤗🇦🇺
Doesn't matter if I've seen these before, I'll still watch them cos I know it will make me smile!. I don't think you realise how much mirth, smiles and laughs you and your doglets have bought to the World! Good on you all!. More please.
A classic British humor………..
Why do I feel a doggy gym contract makes more sense 🙄??
I see you found the swimming pool 😂😂
The juice 🥤 and smoothly bar 😂😂
Thank you Mr.Cotter
I love these two!
More
I have a theory as to who's disliking these videos. It's all the evil squirrels Olive and Mabel are chasing.
Taken your clothes off and bringing your own equipment.
I love all the sticks lined up in the corner Lol
Anyone who just doesn’t ‘get’ dog ownership surely does now . Those dear wee faces !
Keep fit equipment , a pile of sticks leaning against the wall !
i am black. black people are only 12% of the population.
You're barking mad.
I think I speak for everyone here (except any cats who may be watching) that we need to see an 'Olive & Mabel: The Motion Picture'
Thanks for uploading. Love your work. Olive & Mabel are amazing 🤩
Any plans for new episodes? I miss you three!
This guy is a genius.  Just what I need right now.  So funny.
So funny, my dog would be just like this beauty on the right haha. Dogs are the best 😃😍🥰
These videos make my day!
That swimming pool is on the same level as the TumblrCon ball pit... if anyone remembers that!
The sticks... I'm absolutely loving your humour.  Truly ingenious.
The balls is how they get you, now you're stuck with the platinum membership😖
❤️
Mabel looks positively depressed.
Such an amazing video, have you registered your dog on the monkoodog app? its specially designed for dogs and dog parents, you can create your dog's profile in it. It's amazing as it has everything related to dogs. When you select your location the app will show nearby pet shops groomer breeders trainers vet clinics all related to dogs. You can connect with other dog parents nearby your location also. You can track your dog's vaccinations, deworming dates, growth charts. you can check it out, it is pretty cool!
Brilliant! Love those bunny photobombs
Brilliant!
Where have Olive and Mable gone. I just watched this one for the second time, of course it was as good as the first time. But would like to see some new ones.
This is pure genius
Best thing to come out of lockdown
❤️❤️❤️ 😂
Wonderfull support after my beautiful golden lab Taio died.thank you,Nicki
They knew biscuit!
It must have taken way longer to put the props together than it did to make the video. Thank you for your creativity and your obvious love for your beautiful dogs. You dear man are a star 🌟 🐶🌟
I've just discovered Olive and Mabel. They, and their friend mrandrewcotter, are wonderfully delightful! I look forward to many more videos.
Great!  Very entertaining.
Totally brilliant! Thank you.
I just discovered you yesterday, but am having a lot of fun watching and introducing others! Thanks!
Your videos are absolutely gold. I can't get this silly smile off my face and I love it!
You are hilarious have you written for a comedy show at one time
I love your videos. They make me smile!
How do I sign up for this gym? The sticks had me dying 🤣
Just SOOOO  so funny!!!!!!
Incredible ... I am laughing out loud all by my self and it feels soooooo good!!   Love Olive and Mabel :)
😂😂😂😂😂
Just an hour of downward dog!!!!  I,love the man best !
Pure Gold, love it when it got to Mable and the 'swimming pool' lololol
I can’t believe how happy I was to see the green rabbit was rescued from the old house!  🥰🥰🥰
I just love your videos! Keep them coming. Isn't it about time that they get their learner permits to drive a car? It would be easier to chase the squirrels!
The "platinum package" was amazing, such enthusiasm! .... This rubber ball *HUUMGH* <wags all round>
This is my new favorite channel!!!!
Delighted to see Olive and Mabel running the course for this year's Boat Race .. Cotter and Cracknell only bit part players in this .. loved to see Olive having a good old role in something very dubious on the banks of the River Ouse... Great fun
Mabel has her own little fetid pond pool with an inch of fetid water she can wallow in.  Doggy nirvana!
Thank you for bringing us some great subtle and hilarious posts!! Wonderful work.  Quite good...”such a good boy, yes you are,”😀😀😀💯🦴🦴🦴🥓🥓🍪🍪🍪
😍🙌😂🤣
nice voice, nice accent...i would have the same expression as Olive🐕
Made me giggle, thank you! I was just having a cry, then watched this
I just love these videos.
The expressions on the dogs' faces are just so good! They're taking it all in, so watch out for payback one day. Soon.
❤️
The juice and smoothie bar was posh. I wish that my $200 USD/month gym had such luxe
I just laughed so loudly my 95 year old mom asked what happened. I love these three.
You had me finished at " I can see you've already taken your clothes off- which is pretty inappropriate". Sensational stuff! 👌
Labs rule !
New here and have fallen in love with pets and master.
I love the sticks!
Who doesnt want to catch those damn squirrels
It doesn't matter how often I watch these - they bring me such joy!  Thank you, Olive, Mabel and Mr. Cotter
That's basically just me holding a biscuit in front of your nose on a treadmill! 😅🤣😂
I’m here for my “Olive and Mabel” fix. Withdrawals are getting pretty bad.
Simply love Olive and Mabel!
oh those faces....
Leg lifts...
Yeesss your back
Had a “ruff” day and just watched this.  Definitely helped lower my bp and make me 🤣😂🤣.  Thank you!
I just love these! 😁
Do they have any plans to team up with Tesla Tedd ?
They took off their collars in the "locker room." Awwwwwwwww. Those different stick sizes!!! So cute!!!!
I love the 'Labrador Laser Focus' at 1:26...   Olive almost took a chunk of Andrew's hand.  :)
Very clever!
God I love these two!
Great video!  Couild do with some laughs.
You are the best!! Love this!
This is how they sell it. Works. Even O 'n M went for the rubberball formula, while I grow FAT....much love from France.
(
I loved the sticks! 😄😄😄😄
♥♥♥love♥♥♥
Lockdown stir crazy!
Every time I come back to watch these, I want to thank Mr Cotter personally. He has such a lovely sense of humor and we all benefit from his creativity.
What animal is disliking these ....;) get it
Remember when “inappropriate behavior” was a real shameful thing? Yeah, me neither here in America. 🥸
I am in withdrawal since this last one. I need more videos! I know I know creativity can’t be rushed. But I Need another hit !
I’m going to send this link to my clients in my newsletter this month for motivation, once again you’ve made my day thanks for the giggles
Irrelevant, I know, but how much I love Mabel and Olive,  can you you find a way to comment on  ALL of the Scotland home  rugby games? I always feel a bit hard done by, if you are not there to explain,  when the opposition has its cronies to do us a  disservice. England  6. Scotland 11, or is it 13, it should ( Have been so much more,  thanks Hoggie.
I love Mabel and Olive!  Adorable and entertaining.  Andrew Cotter ain't bad either.....tee hee
“What ? You physically can’t do that? not with that attitude” 😂😂😂😂😂😂❤️
Brilliant beyond brilliant...is amazingly cool!!!
These are just brilliant and hysterical. I know you say the dogs are the stars, Andrew, but without you and your great wit and humor, it would be just two cute dogs among millions of other cute dog videos. You have great comedic timing. So much fun too. Thank you and please keep them coming. 😁🎤🐕🐶🐾🤣
They are the sweetest dogs just love how they listen to Andrew so intensely
I love these videos!!!  Thank you for the laughs :)))))
Cannot wait for the next post pure comedy genius x
Do you think your book will ever be available on Audible in Spain?  I would rather listen to your dulcet tones than read about Mabel and Olive’s exploits.
Never laughed so much. So funny.
Love it!!!!
I love this man and his dogs!
When they wag their tail in unison they are too much for my weak heart to handle!💕💕
Wonderful, adorable please keep them coming  xx 🐿🐿
More please!!!🤣😂
Good puppies.
Glad to see the rabbit made it home! Envious of their swimming pool - it's more than most of us can access at the moment!
😀❤️🤗❤️🤗
Absolutely wonderful—makes me smile every time! Thank you for sharing and adding narrative to the conversations and thoughts we all have with our fur babies now and again!! 🐾
Freebes always make the deal!
The funniest yet! More please.
Is it true Black Labs Matter ?
So funny! Their expressions are priceless ☺️ Lovable Mabel and Olive -- I just want to play with them and enjoy a cuddle! Lovely video, thanks 😊
Hahahahaha
Please never stop[.
Totally love it 💪💪
Brilliant.
the commentary before olive and mabel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8AYtT2gIBw&t=6s&ab_channel=ScottishRugby
Love love love. Lol💚💚
Shouldn't they be wearing masks?
Another must see from Olive & Mabel & of course Andrew.
Oh my, I'm rolling with laughter. Thanks
Good
Oodles of cuteness 🥰. Love this so much!
Hahahaahaahaha! !!
Mabel, she just LOOOVES the water 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 Amooooreeee 💜💚💙❤❤❤❤
hahaha
Brilliant, I got your book for Christmas, thoroughly enjoyed it, I laughed and cried in equal measure at the antics and sentiments within it. I’ve encouraged others to read it, it’s made me miss our long, gone dog all the more...❤️
I love these girls so much — thank you, Andrew, for sharing them with us!
1 minute and 48 seconds of pure gold 😂😍
Well needed mate Thank you
The wag at the end while standing in the swimming pool was the cutest thing ever xD
One of our dogs has hydrotherapy and I've just learnt that she can take a friend so I'm looking forward to doing a couple of lengths each week.
Thank you Mr. Cotter for yet another enjoyable video.
I. Want. The. Platinum. Package. You get salesman of the year, Andrew.
So funny!!! Many thanks for all that you do with Olive & Mabel! Cheers from Montreal!
Olive & Mabel are pure gold!  Such a great gym owner to have those nice, hefty sticks lined up in the gym!!!
I live for each new post.
This is soo hilarious, you have some imagination and creativity 🤣
Brilliant! Never fails to make me smile!
Thank goodness the toy wasn't left behind in the move. Lol
"No, you can't bring in your own equipment. "  The plaid bunny(?) made it to the new home! Yah! That parting glance at the old homestead and bunny was on the floor - I teared up. crazy, I know.
It's just so lovely! 🤗
Brilliant, they're absolutely gorgeous. Love these videos xx
"yoga is downward dog for an hour" - I'll sign up for that.
Olive,any tips on underarm flab please?Oh and by the by..that pool size ?Platinum Level...seriously?? Honestly.. can't see it happening pet.Maybe tiime for a wee note to Management.. but use Suggestion Box..you know what 'him up there ' is like!
The 65 people who downvoted this have crimped and desolate souls......
Love it! ❤️❤️
New Year ,new body...I like your Get Up n Go attitude gals.You are an inspiration..Seriously I think you look just great anyway..did you REALLY have to go to the expense of the Platinum Package tho when all that walking has kept the Christmas binge eating in trim anyway? You felt like a January splurge?Oh well we are all only human right and ya..you are absolutely spot on..You DID spend money on the on-line dating so ya it makes sense.. what with Valentine's Day just around the corner n all.Proof you can still mess up but move on and value yourself moving on again.(Pity those damn biscuits are sooo  tasty tho!)Best of luck in all your 2021 adventures Olive and Mabel..may all your fitness dreams come true.Keep the Covid Stone at bay at all costs!xx
Omg they are so very patient while Andrew explains the equipment and plan options !
Brilliant! Never ceases to make me laugh. I love the sticks in the gym equipment!❤️
I love Olive & Mabel.  Just watched the 60 Minutes Australia segment about this owner and how videos started with Olive & Mabel.  Truly, so heartfelt and love how he loves his dogs!
I just love those two gorgeous doggos... and your commentary is wonderful, keep up the great work ♥️♥️♥️♥️👏👏👏😂😂😂
😂🎖👏🏻
Oh,, Mable when you mention biscuits. ❤️💕🌎🌻🌹🐱🌈💜
Who are the losers that gave this 👎🏻?
Makes my day.  Thank you for making us giggle.
Laughed so hard coffee came out my nose when I saw Mable in the pool!! 😣😳🤣🤣🤣
Hilarious! :)
Labs have the most expressive eyes! They are adorable. Fun video!!
These two never disappoint! Love you all.
Haha I just love these, the girls play into your hands every time!!
Somebody's spending too much time in gyms! 🤣
Mr. Cotter you are the best and far more entertaining than perhaps you realize🇨🇦
Platinum package for 200 a month?  200 face and hand licks!  Maybe 200 fine pieces of yard waste?
I'd like a membership please!
Not with that attitude 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is it almost time for the food bowl speed challenge rematch?
I can't believe he scammed his own dogs!
The best.
Gorgeous Labs
Disappointed no smoothie bar.
My boyfriend was watching soccer and I got excited because I recognized the voice from the guy who does the olive and mabel videos!
Oh my god. I’m dying😂😂😂
Keep us updated!
Can barely stand the banter! So dang funny! Love these girls and their clever Dad!
I joined a gym for the new year! I’m hoping to lose $30.00 a month...
The smoothie bar 😂
Just hilarious as always!
Thank you ❤
I’ve missed you both so much. Hopefully 21 will bring lots of posts. Happy New Year girls. Xx
Yoga...an hour of downward dog........totals xx
Another hit 👍🏻🐾😂🐾👍🏻 thanks again Olive, Mabel, and Andrew Cotter! 🥰
Great way to start my day (of staying home)  Thank you Olive and Mabel and Mr Cotter. Brilliant
Love your voice x
I was so worried! Now that the three of you have a book out, I thought the girls wouldn’t have time to keep up here. And, we all know that someone who wants stardom, is always wanting people to notice them. Once they have become big stars they just want to run down to the Piggly-Wiggly and shop without anyone taking their picture or film them on a cell phone shopping the paper goods isles. (“Just watch her! She is picking up the jumbo pack of potty paper! What is the matter with her that she needs 16 rolls of toilet paper?”) But the girls are back. Thank goodness!
they have both decided their kindly human friend who provides the food has gone mental but as long as he gives them the rubber balls its ok.
As the owner of two Labs myself, your videos are gold! The facial expressions are so... Labrador!
Omg give them pets!!!!!
Genius video ....keep up the good work . All The Best & hello from New Zealand .
You are amazing funny 😆 I love these videos.
Mabel's expression !!!?!?! 😆😇😅🤗
I laughed so hard at this video! Thanks for brightening my day.
Sending positive thoughts and prayers as you go through another lockdown.  Here in the USA/Philadelphia we continue to just try to stay sane counting down to 6 days from now, and watching a new Olive and Mabel is just the way to do that.  I just love your video's!!
I just love your videos, the dogs and you narrating! Please more!
I'm so very GRATEFUL for your silliness. Here in Northwest PA our congressman voted against the election. Very sad so thank you so very much.
Thank you made my day.
Priceless🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I click on a movie called "home gym" and suddenly all my advertisements are about running shoes and protein shakes. Don't tell them I'm a lazy dog.
Mr Cotter, Olive & Mabel I salute you! I have missed the sound of your voice booming out of my telly come rugby time and your two best friends are amazing... so patient until the RUBBER BALLS APPEAR, GIVE ME THE BALL...GIVE ME THE BAAAAAALL I WANT TO STAND IN THE WATER! 🤣👍👍
Thank you, Mr. Cotter, Olive and Mabel--I'm smiling for the first time in a while! xo to you all!
I love the way they stare at you.  Great stick gag as well.
Haha thanks for the laugh 😛
😂😂😂😂
💋
LOL!!!! thank you.
When will the audiobook of Olive, Mabel and Me be available in the US? I want to hear that lovely Scottish accent regaling me with stories of your squirrel-loving Labradors.
I have to said that your dogs look  sad eyes, unhappy, any connoisseur can see that.
I’m so happy to see these 2 again! Your commentary is so great!
Love to see new videos! They make my day. Thank you for all of them!!
Always the laughter! Thanks all!
Glad you are back. You brighten my day.
Another delightful and heartwarming video to make my day! Thank you so much Andrew. You are helping me get through this difficult time in our world history.
Platinum it is! Great stuff :)
Platinum good choice.
https://youtu.be/2D_cBxcZSH8 Would love to see you add commentary to this video 😂
That is hilarious!  Love the pool - the girls were more enthusiastic about the freebies I have to say!
love love love ... love these videos, thank you Andrew, Olive and Mabel xx
Fabulous to get a tour of the new gym.   Olive and Mabel are certainly going to enjoy their platinum memberships.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What good girls!!
A masterpiece.
Thank you sooo much Andrew, you, Olive, and Mabel have made life during the pandemic SO much more enjoyable💕
Babbbies 🥰🥰🥰
Getting in shape will def help with the online dating.
The harmony spa!!!
I wish life was so simple that a rubber ball could bring such happiness...
I laugh and laugh when watching your videos. lol--the sticks!!!! My labs do downward dog all the time. All labs live for food, walks, balls, and water.
Love, love, love these videos 😂😂😂😂😂 omg thanks so much for the belly laugh, just what I needed!
Well not with that attitude no
Hilarious.
😂😂😂💙💙💙
Laugh! I nearly fell off my wallet.
Olive and Mabel try another gym. Love from Ballarat.Australia.
Looks like my gym! Keep up the good work!
Sweet babies
I love you and really live them. Mr cotter you rock
Dumb question: which one is Olive and which one is Mabel?
are you the funniest person alive?  I laugh out loud and make everyone watch your vids.  And you love your dogs.  Those sticks along with the weights.....a dog person
Mr. Cotter...are you for hire? I have a jack Russell with attitude about everything!🇨🇦
Such is lockdown, the appearance of the woollen rabbit toy has pleased me more than perhaps it should have.
What a salesman! 🐕🐈‍⬛❤️❤️
Love Mabel going straight to the pool and I see Olive is getting a few grey hairs, bless her. Adored the book, btw.
No one minds putting on a little extra  f-LAB with Olive and Mabel! 😁🐶🐕
Congratulations Mr Cotter on your Mastermind win! The Pets will be fit in no time at all.....🐕🐕👌
Hahahahaha
M
How can 40 folk not like this 🙄
So is the shower area the pressure washer in the corner
On an above the entertainment value of these postings .... it is just heartwarming to see such content and well looked after doggies. Well done Mr. Cotter.!!
I would like to buy these 2 dogs and bring them to Canada
love to you guys....HAPPY NEW YEAR & HAPPY NEW WORKOUT!
Sublime!
I’d love me some O&M merch. Actually, OM 🕉
Olive and Mabel you are to be commended for your exquisite behaviour... ...and your "free weights" are brilliant...🇿🇦
I’m excited for the girls! This gym comes with the most impressive juice bar, free weights, and balls!!!! My dogs get the same boring park every day. And not a stick in sight 💔 Happy 2021 to you and the girls! I pray it will bring much reason to rejoice.
These videos are glorious 🐶
Andrew you are an absolute shining star in the midst of all the darkness the US is going through. Thank you!
Everyone should read this guys book. It’s sensational.
one of your best
The man is a genius. Brilliant start to the New Year. Well done Mr Cotter 😅😂😅
Thank You for the laughter & entertainment you bring into our lives while sharing Mabel & Olive with us. I love how you do these. So truly Grateful 💜
@mrandrewcotter You have no idea how your videos have helped me through a difficult time. Thank you so much!
Brilliant!!!
Absolutely love this ! So special !
They've already taken their clothes off lol. AWKWARD... 😂
Hysterical.
Comic relief. Love 🐾🐾🦮🦮
Could I make a request for your Christmas video to be uploaded to YouTube please Sir? Happy New Year! To you & those lovely girls ❤️
No, you can't bring in your own equipment...I splattered tea on my computer screen....your fault :-).
The Free Weights selection of sticks - genius!
Soaking those paws 🐾.  Love the sticks.  😅💙
PERFECT! BRILLIANT!
Having owned Labs before these 2 are brilliant ambassadors of the funniest breed on the planet, thankyou for letting us into their world 😂😂😂
I needed that! So funny
Thanks for that smile in dark times!
Adorable. Wonderful ladies. ❤️😘👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️
It appears I too enjoy the “silver package” as my personal trainer employs a similar motivational technique but uses a Jaffa Cake.
We LOVE YOU GUYS esp now in America with our crazy 45
Mabel's face!! She is trying so hard to figure out what the heck you are talking about! (By the way, your book is amazing - I haven't laughed so much in a long time!)
Me thinks they got conned!
LOL! I love it!
Grrrreat!
😂😂😂more videos please. Xx
Brilliant more more  please!!!!!!!
$200 a month   Olive and Mabel DONT be sucked in   It’s highway robbery   When he isn’t looking steal the sticks   Then run run run away with them 😀❤️
´Catching squirrels’ is a great goal! My chocolat lab caught two, and a ground hog just to show off. Luckily I had practice screaming ‘drop it’ so everybody lived to tell the tale! 🤣
Delightful as always. Thanks you for sharing these wonderful videos with us.
Morning yoga with these two! Or would it be doga? 🧘‍♂️🐶
In fairness, the biscuit and treadmill combo might work on many humans. Not me, though. Course not.
This just makes my heart so happy 🤗
😂😂😂The dogs are looking at you as if to say What’s going on?????😂😂😂
Brilliant! 🤣😂🤣
200 what a month? Tail wags? 😹
😂😎 Home schooling next 👍
Thanks guy's, sign my pup up for the platinum package, looks pawsome! 😊
🤣😂🤣😄😄😄 can’t stop laughing!
Melody.......we had a yellow lab years ago, lived to be 15, would eat anything.  Like when we’d only had him a couple of weeks as a pup he was on antibiotics, and ate the lot and the cardboard box overnight.  And later scoffed two layers of Dairy Box chocolates, including the little paper cups, while we were out of the room!  Never had any problems.
Hi girls🐕🐕
Such beautiful labs😍, they’re such a pleasure. Thanks for the videos!
I see you've taken your clothes off already,  which is pretty inappropriate 🤣🤣. I say that to my dog when his collar's been taken off to loaf the inside of the house 🤣🤣🤣
Ok..this is funny..
That was a wonderful way to start day 307 since the first covid lockdown. My dog Lizzy tells me she would never fall for for that ball trick. But then she is the only dog that doesn’t care much for balls anyway. Thanks for the smiles
And by a mile, still the best thing about this pandemic !!
Excellent! 😂
haha. catch the squirrels =D
No matter what I'm doing, it's immediately put aside when a new Olive & Mabel video is posted. You and the girls are the whole (platinum) package. ♥️♥️♥️😂😂😂
Thank you so much Mr Cotter - you have brightened our day and your dogs are beautiful.
These videos make my day!
H just the breath of fresh we all needed thank you!
That's pretty much me in the gym.
I DIDN'T THINK THIS ONE WAS VERY GOOD!!!!  And then I watched it a 2nd , 3rd,  100th time...  The timing, sharp witt & labrador clown faces are pure addictive genius ....
Ahhh thank the heavens for Mabel and Olive, my day just got a whole lot better 👏😃
Love the lost toy made an appearance
All they hear is “blah, blah, blah, biscuit” “blah, blah, blah, ball”. They’re listening very intently though.
Olive and Mabel are so cute
Adorable! I really needed this today. And Mabel's soft toy- is that her favourite one? I noticed it in her mouth in your new column. 😍😍😍 This whole video was just precious and hilarious, thank you!
I’d join any gym that they work out in, I love the rack, and platinum level perks... my own black four-legged dog Poppy would like to sign up too for platinum
Every one you make is a gem. How is that possible?
So happy to see that today. Keep em coming ❤
I love how Mabel hangs on your every word. She's just about to speak English, I can tell.
Your videos bring me such joy!!
Ahhhhh adorable!! I so missed them these last few days
I’ve just had one of the worst conversations of my 15 yr. marriage and you made me smile.  Girls, don’t use the gym, keeping us happy is exercise enough (but get Cotter doing some free weights, here?)
Yay! Bunny made the move! A fantastic rescue mission with an epic soundtrack would have been amazing, but this works too.  Subtle yet effective.
It's clear to see that you love them to bits
I needed this. We all need a lot more of this, please.
I love to see a new post from Olive and Mabel.
Love it a new video from Olive & Mabel & Andrew. Nice  Labrador Gym....equipped with sticks, water& treats, & balls...Now you need to include a nap/relaxation areas & assorted yak chews
We've got 4 maniac rescue dogs and without  them, Olive and Mabel, after last week's magaterrorists horror, I'd be drinking 24/7. God protect President Biden. #25thAmendmentNOW
The sticks killed me, and then the downward dog comment, hilarious....
Does anyone else crack up when they see Mabel's nose up close? Don't know why but I do every time.
OUTSTANDING 😍😎😊😂😘
The sticks shot: pure gold😂😂😂😂😂
I think The Fetid Pond will be a groovy name for a pub in the After Times
Omg these just keep getting better!!,, Edit: just noticed the stereotypical house music in the background haha nice touch.
Little Mable, is definitely growing up!
This rockets to the Top Three, well DONE Olive and Mabel!
The “spa”...just a a bucket and hose! Don’t be fooled ladies.....lockdown may have gone to your Dad’s head,!
These videos are priceless. Thank you so much Andrew. As the world is going on lock down, are you guy one pause (paws) for a bit lol ;)
Ahh. I needed that today! Thank you!!
What's wrong with the Harmony Spa? Well it is just a bucket and hose. 😂😂 Love Olive & Mabel & their human, Andrew. Hogmanay!
The last one seems very important. :)
If you were to die today, would you know you're destination?  The bad news: The Bible says we all fall short of the glory of God.  Romans 3:23 “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;”   The Good news: We have an advocate, God in the flesh, AKA Jesus Christ, who gave up glory and became a man, who died for all of our sins, past, present and future.   1 Corinthians 15:1-5 King James Version 15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  5 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:  The VERY GOOD news: If we believe the gospel, that Jesus died for our sins, we will have eternal life, in a place much better than here, without suffering, without pain, in paradise   Dont take pride in all your luxuries you have here, because you cant take it with you to heaven. And if you could, what good is it if you're burning in hell? 🤦‍♂️  Make no mistake, Jesus is coming soon.
they are so cute
You’ve saved so many ppl’s sanity with these lovely girls 🧡 thanks so much
Classic high pressure tactics (smh)
The classiest commentator I've ever heard.  Love it  :)
Hilarious! Great work!
I hope Olive and Mabel don’t buy the Platinum membership and use the gym once and then never go again like someone I know who definitely isn’t  me.
Awww, you went back for the rabbit  :)  So that is your new digs.
Love the rack of sticks 😅
"You can't bring your own equipment" 😂
💕💕💕
Love this, love this so much! "Basically just me holding a biscuit in front of your nose on the treadmill."
Make sure they know there’s no peeing in the pool!! Never could do the “downward dog” myself. It’s rough on the lower back!
Thank you for making me laugh today😅
SQUIRREL!
darling the dogs are lucky to have such a funny guy. soft ball. they can be the out fielders. thanks. like the accent. from an infj
Thank you, all 3, so much for briging us so much simple pleasure!
Hilarious!  It took me a moment or two with those sticks in the equipment rack. 🤣.  I think these guys are going to be like most of us.  Their interest in gym membership is going to wane by the start of February.  They'll prefer to be outside in that full size fetid pool they've been known to frequent and, yes, just chasing those squirrels!  Old habits die hard! 👍😃
Wonderful stuff, Andrew, thanks for bringing Olive and Mabel and your supervising self into our lives!
Ha ha brilliant!
Oh how I needed this. Thank you, Olive, Mabel, and Andrew. Some things are so necessary. The U.S. is in near despair, and I only get comfort from lovely animals. Thanks again.
They'll be bored by February and want to cancel by March. That's when they'll be hit by a huge cancellation fee that they didn't spot in one of the claws. 😉
I love how they look at each item u talk about. They r so sweet. Thanks as always for the smiles.
I love Mabel's facial expression though the video, like she if sitting in attention 🤣🤣
I wish I could put on my bunny slippers and walk around in their heads just for a few minutes...thank you for brightening an otherwise nearly intolerable day in Oregon!
Love this! Keep them coming...
we need olive and Mabel more than ever, thank you!
Look at the wee faces.
I wonder if there is something wrong with me   . I love watching these videos a bit too much.
Oh god I love these 🤣😂🤣 highlight of YouTube and indeed the world...
Happy to see the stuffed rabbit didn't get left behind after all.
Brilliant, can I sign my two up as well.
The best rugby commentator around 👌🏉🏉🏉🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Make sure you get a full membership fee upfront.
Superb 10/10
Love it!
Absolutely fantastic! Do you accept cats to your gym??😂😂😂
United States loves your doggos ❤️ at least we have that going for us! 🤣
Love the tail wag at the end.
Who down votes this???
"Thumbs up" is simply not enough!  Brilliant.  Banish the Winter Blues with you three.  Thank you so much for being there
😂
Genius 😂
Downward Dog😂😂 Smoothie bar🤣🤣 Every line is genius. Please just give up the day job (if it ever comes back) O&M  are the best
Your videos always brighten my day!! ❤️
Harmony Spa 💙
They were listening so intently!
Welcome to your new home and happy new year
Life is so much better with Andrew, Olive and Mabel in it!  Thank you!
Laughter and joy is what we need right now and Olive and Mabel bring it every time! Thank you so much!
Nice to see you and the girls are settling in, and that the rabbit wasn't left behind.
Love it!! 💕💕💕🇨🇦
Get those Squirrels - GET'EM!!!
Olive was looking especially shiny & beautiful. She must have come straight from the beauty parlor. 😍
My mother loved your channel and seeing what your girls got up to. She passed away in August 2020 (leaving behind a yellow lab called Daisy and a blonde Frenchie called Maggie) and I find such comfort in enjoying something she did. I’d often here a comment about a new video when we spoke and was lucky enough to watch a few with her before she died. Keep up the great work and joy you bring to others. ✌🏻❤️🐾🐾
JESUS IS COMING SO SOON Y’ALL! Repent and trust in Jesus alone! Jesus is the only way! Lemme know how I can pray for you : )  God created the world good and perfect, but we as humans have rebelled against that by sinning. Every single one of us has sinned. And just like on earth te here’s punishment for breaking the law, so there’s punishment for breaking God’s law: death and eternal separation in hell. BUT HERE’S THE GOOD NEWS: out of God’s deep and unconditional love for us, He sent His one and only son to take that punishment. Jesus is eternal and never committed any sin, He is 100% God and 100% man, and He just loves you ever so much. He paid the price IN FULL for our sins, so that we don’t have to. We owed a debt to God and Jesus paid it. And He rose 3 days later proving His sacrifice was accepted. Now all you have to do, is repent and trust in Jesus alone!!  God is so good! He has pulled me out of the darkest place, and sharing the good news of the Gospel is in the hopes that He can help someone else too : )
With that kind of attitude 😂😂😂
I think that the ladies will enjoy the pool even more once it's had a chance to develop a more stagnant character.
Aww! Olive and Mabel are back! 😍😍
Am reading the book & love learning how the girls came to be the famous Olive & Mabel stars.
I hate gym membership strong-arm tactics!  I always cave too!
Thank you!  I needed that today.  It’s one of those days where the even  Harmony Spa looks relaxing!
Love these two 💛🥰🐾
The Pool, it get's em every time
Juice and smoothie bar. Priceless.
You physically can’t do that? Well, not with that attitude, no. 😆😆😆
Too funny!
I’m going to put this video on a loop to keep me laughing because the world outside of this video is too depressing.
Love love love olive and mabel.  Superstars
Those faces are PRICELESS!!   Andrew, you are awesome!!! :)
How are you and the pups enjoying your new home?  I have a 13 year old rescue dog 🐕 and he is popular in the neighborhood.  He and I really enjoy your videos.  Please keep them coming.  K.
They should visit a nudist colony next!😙
Awwww, it's good to know that their New Year's resolution is to cath the squirrels. 😉❤🤣
I love the way Olive is clearly not impressed but Mabel is so focused on the T&C’s 😀
I have never joined A gym. I will pay top price to join olive and Mabel in yours.my cindy would love the pool.
Hilarious 😂
Love it!!  Now my boys want to join!
They are beautiful
Absolutely brilliant 😂
"Well not with that attitude, no" Snorted out loud at that.
The Platinum Pawkage, what every discerning dog chooses! 😳😜😂😂
There is a comment to be made here about balls being the Platinum Package that finally tempts the ladies, but I'll refrain.
I have the same Harmony Spa at home - maybe I should consider charging membership fees, too!
I look at these videos from Olive and Mabel's perspective sometimes, and it cracks me up to imagine what they're really thinking.  "WTF is Andrew saying?  Why am I just sitting here?  Am I getting a biscuit?  Whenever he holds that phone up for a long time, I seem to get biscuits."
We want to know what New Year diet Olive and Mabel are following to complement their new fitness regime. As important influencers their choices could be very persuasive. My Labrador, Cleo, loved the big bottle of 'Canine' she had for Christmas
Love it! Love it! Love it! 😍
BRILLIANT 😂😂😂😂
Love, love, love this. Thank you.
More More - they make me so happy.
I laughed out loud at...everything! Sign me up for yoga at 8...is that AM?? Oh maybe not...
I love the branches of wood stacked in the free weights lol 😂
Wonderful, healing laughter, pleasure, joy.  Love and gratitude from San Diego, California.
That stick bar! :D Totally worth platinum membership.
And that is the attitude and carefree enthusiasm of most people who start the gym on a new years resolution. Brilliant
😃
Mojo, my choccie lab wants in as well!
The weight rack with the branches...
So cute
Obviously Mabel went straight for the pool. She has that natural swimmer's physique!
love it
The rack of sticks in the free weight section is too funny.
Thank you for always making me smile xx
The eyes say it all.
Do you have 200 a month to spend? If so, you both must have great jobs and one sensational boss!
Love when they finally get the rubber balls there tails go crazy hahaha
I wish I had such a luxurious gym!
need to join plz...…...membership info would be appreciated!!!
One of the bright spots in my life, videos of Olive and Mabel.
Good on them - I can never catch the squirrels :-)
Thanks for bringing on the new laughs. We need it so bad here in the States.
“It’s pretty much just an hour of downward dog.”
thank you for some laughs during this difficult time.
I have to pause as I'm watching so my laughter doesn't block the next joke
I’d go for the platinum package. It’s a no brainer!
Make sure they actually show up at the gym! I love the way they react when they hear the word "biscuit".
Rabbit made it!  Love the ending on this one, too.
😍 glad you are back And spot on video for the new year....
Mabel's an olympic swimmer!
Wonderful!
Wonderful
Now that's my kind of gym 😂 oh and loving the book 🐶🐕
My pulis are keen on the freeweights but requests more hurdles 🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺🌭 and sausages
What a nice dog park you created!
they love their balls! the word biscuit went down well too :)
"Not with that attitude, no."
Mabel and Olive always brighten up my day 😂, thanks to you 3 !
Another classic. Thank you all for making me lol🤣🤣🤣
How we need Andrew Cotter, Olive, and Mabel here in the states. Thank you. You made our day.
Dear Olive and Mabel, don’t do it. I paid a£400 for a year to a gym with a swimming pool and I went twice.. most expensive swims I ever had. XX THANKS for the giggles xx
Brilliant!!
Brilliant !
I love the weights! Various sizes of sticks!
Don’t do it Olive and Mabel! You know you won’t be able to keep it up and the gym will make shed loads of bones from you
The Harmony Spa..😀 weve all pretty much fallen for that one...bucket and a hose.. brilliant
You are hysterical ❗️I want to boop their noses ❗️❤️
Can I send my little dog over I think he’d like to join Oliver Mabel he needs to lose 3 pounds. I think your plans great. I do love the idea of the downward dog.  😂😂😂♥️♥️♥️♥️🐾🐾🐾🐾
I love the tail wags as you explain.  Once they get the Platinum Package explained, joy explodes!  They win again.
Olive, Mabel oh no! You've fallen for the platinum! It's the old bait and switch. First the flashy rubber balls then in a week tired deflated balls with no bounce. Negotiate for biscuits up front.
Thank the lord for olive and Mabel ☺️☺️
Olive and Mabel what would we do without you , say fit and well ,sending love ❤️🐾🐾
I love you! <3
Love this. Hope you all enjoy the new gym.
Thank you for a fun break in a miserable time in the US
Olive and Mabel make me smile. Bless all of your hearts. 🇨🇦😉
Brilliant, keep these coming please Andrew, as boy do we all need a laugh these days, love the different sized sticks lined up.The other week I heard you commentating on the radio on I think rugby, all I could think of was “where’s Olive and Mabel” then I remembered you were doing your proper job 😄thank you for the videos and laughs.
Harmony spa 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Still laughing!
Absolutely fabulous!
You got me at the different length sticks leaning so neatly against the wall. 😄
A thousand thank yous for the joy you bring in to my day
Will there be a supplemental chapter to go in the book about this one? ;-)
Sounds like a gym I would love to join!
Mabels face
This made my (difficult) day much better, thanks, 🤣👏🏻
LOL..Ah I see you've found the swimming pool..enjoy :D
These clips just crack me up.... I like the idea of the juice bar and the swimming pool.... ☺️
Dear Andrew, I believe you are due the Nobel peace prize. If they ask, I will nominate and if given a chance, vote in favor.
Brilliant.....love it 😁
Excellent,  need Olive and Mabel  to brighten up these days ❤❤
😂😂😂
So so soooo sweet, thank you Andrew, Olive and Mabel ❤️
'Well not with that attitude, no' haha!! So brilliant, I really needed this today, thank you for making us laugh in these awful times, beautiful dogs.
Mate...can I borrow your pressure washer?
Delightful video!
Absolutely brilliant, we get our new chocolate lab puppy on the 30th , really carnt wait 😁👍
Need a “tree wall” for climbing workouts. 😄😄  Good to see the toy made it to the new house.
Twelve squirrels  disliked this video.
...meeting like-minded people... how WUFFLY for the girls!!  Happy New Year to Olive, Mabel and Mr Andrew Cotter...
Everybody should look at these videos, it would improve the nations well being immensely. Just seeing there’s a new one puts a grin on my face. Those sticks lined up, genius!   I love the comments below as well. There are some very witty people!
Great vids Thankyou well needed at these times
So glad you have you back !!
Joy.
Why 11 thumbs down? Who couldn't love these videos. They're little rays of sunshine 🥰🥰
Class act👍🇦🇺
My lab is showing some interest. Wondering whether cats are allowed, she's a bit of a snob
If they don't adhere to the hygiene rules, will they be kicked out?
I’ve Been having withdrawal symptoms ... so glad you are back from you Christmas holidays
🤣👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
“Non-marking soles...” - no chance with a dog. Please bring your own mop, and no farting when doing the downward dog - what do you mean it’s better out than in?
Standard rack🤔😂
Fab! 🤣
You bring a big smile to me on a grey, wet January morning... thank you ! 😀
“Non marking soles” and there’s some visible paw prints behind them 😀
Andrew, thanks so much for that! Very funny. Everything sounds even funnier with your wonderful accent.
It seems to me that this was filmed with a new, or different, camera. Perhaps the lighting is different in the new location.
Mr. Cotter, you and the ladies are absolutely delightful! I certainly hope that when you are forced back to your previous employment, that you do not give up this filming of yourselves. You are bringing such delight to your viewer's lives.
Made my day seeing this. Thank you 🙏
This makes me happy. Please do more more more
Lol such lovely dogs x
There was a definite twitch from Mabel at biscuit ..........
Can't help but laugh..love you guys! ❤❤❤
After the week / past 4 years we've had here in (what used to be the democratic country of) the United States of America,  Olive and Mabel are the perfect tonic. But throw in some gin, jusssssst to be sure . . . 🍸
Hilarious! Brilliant! 😂😂😂 Bless Mr Cotter and his beautiful dogs! 😁
Had me cracking up Andrew!!!!
🤣🤣🤣I’d like to sign an join that gym, too! No, I don’t like chasing squirrels.🥸
Anyone else hoping for some O & M merch?
So great to see the girls!  And Andrew being so smooth selling that platinum package!♥️♥️😄♥️♥️
I love Olive & Mable💕
Love, love, love your dogs and your posts.  So disappointed:  I ordered your book from a 3rd party on Amazon.  They said it was coming for days,  then said it was delayed, then said they were sold out and my money would be returned.  Boohoo.  I'll keep checking back--I'm hoping it will come back to the U.S. soon.  You guys are a national treasure!
So wonderful to find Andrew, Olive, and Mabel in my feed after watching my country face destruction at the hands of a vile, bloviating madman and his evil minions for the past week ( well 4 years, but whose counting)
I've been anxiously waiting for you guys to get settled in from your move. Glad to see you back.
Thank you so much for the new video Mr. Cotter.  Your fans in America really need something to make them smile after the horror of last week. Your beautiful girls are just what I needed today.
Needed that :) . Thank you @mrandrewcotter
Every time I see this lil duo and the commentary, I fall out in stitches!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Does the platinum package include complimentary belly rubs?
I’m die’n😂
These two are already so fit from hiking and running! That must be why Olive has such a shiny coat? I've never seen so shiny a Labrador, she's beautiful.
I would join a gym if I were allowed to chase the squirrels. Unfortunately humans don't get that package option.
Love the rack of fetching sticks!!
Absolutely BRILLIANT!!! ❤
In the crazy times of the US, THIS is what has maintained my grip on SANITY.  Thank you from Des Moines,Iowa.
❤️🐾😂. Thank you!
i want to sign up in this gym! it has the finest clientele!!
Great!  Your videos are uplifting during this time.  Thank you for keeping us sane
Classic hard sell on the gym membership. I hope they maintain those sticks properly and the girls wipe them off after use. Only polite thing to do, ya know. Thanks for a bright moment and chuckles to start off '21 Mr. Cotter!
I love it, “I see you’ve taken your clothes off already, which is actually pretty inappropriate” hilarious!! 😂
Okay folks. I think Andrew is single. Snatch him up y’all
Mable in the swimming pool is adorable!
Your videos and now your book is what has helped me survive this year.  I not only purchased an e-book for myself, I bought an autographed copy of the physical book and bought the book as a gift for three of my friends and am considering getting the audio version just I can hear you read it aloud.  Thank you to you and all the furbabies out there for being there for us every day.
U.S. citizen here. Thank you for giving me a laugh once again. I really needed it! 💕🐶🐶
Absolutely brilliant! Thank you !
After this last week in America, I needed that, thanks.
I’ll take the platinum plan!
You've already taken off your clothes.🙈 you've found the swimming pool.😁 sweethearts .❤❤🐶🐶
I reckon the ‘girls’ will struggle  -  after all how can one improve on perfection ? 😍
I would like the platinum package too please !  😁😁😁😁
They're so good!
Lol
Thank you Mr Andrew Cotter for giving us a moment of humor it times like these. And thank you Olive and Mabel for being totally focused on this project.
Omg. I am dying. Best video yet. Thank you, sir. Your friends across the pond sure needed this! *Hugs*
They were both such good girls! Waited so patiently for those rubber balls! LOL!
THANKS OLIVE AND MABEL, I NEEDED THAT LAUGH TODAY!
Whoa!! That split second between 1:31 and 1:32 when the black dog’s eyes go freakishly wide as she lunges for the ball...
The currently (5) 👎🏽 were lazy cats.
Love these pups!  Mr. Andrew Cotter is too humble to ask you all to click the "THUMBS UP".  So I am asking for him.  CLICK THE THUMBS UP!  It helps the YouTube algorithm and gives him "credit" that is even more important than "Views"!  :-D
You are so funny 😂
The best
😊
My Lab wants in.  One look at the stick line up and the pool did it for her.
Sign me up for the platinum membership
Not overly impressed with the pool - but look out squirrels - the girls mean business 😳🐿🐿🐶🐶 #platinum
Thank you, Andrew, Olive and Mabel....I needed this after such a bad day!  😂🤣
I want to sign up for the spa
Was there a cast change?  The white dog looks different.  Just like the Darrin change in Bewitched.
Oh dear that’s a rip off, you’ve been done Olive and Mabel 💕🐾🐾 😀
"Wear non marking soles" ... Lmao
Yep, sign me up for platinum as well please. Well, as long as Olive and Mabel are there.
"Thank you" x a million...under two minutes and my troubles just drop away and I can laugh and be happy! 🙏👍👏😍🤗❤️
The swimming pool is so much nicer than the fetid pond. The girls have definitely moved up in the world.
Andrew has over vlogged to the point where the permanent ' set ' in his selfie stick arm made him look like an Olympic Gold Medalist in the one armed handstand in a bucket of starch event, which was yet another hurdle for him to overcome, following the upheaval of moving He thought there was a possibility of having to give it up and suggested tentatively that he had a plan to generate gym membership funds by making replica car tyres out of cheese but needed their advice. " You need to tread Caerphilly Andrew " they said. It was just that when he was 10 years of age he remembered curling up ( being Scottish he'd got curling off to a T ) inside a tyre and being rolled downhill.It was a goodyear .Olive and Mabel have affectionately nicknamed him Spud cos he's a commentator (which has left him with a bit of a chip on his shoulder ) and were doggedly determined to convert the garage into a gym as he was sedentary to the point that they thought he was just bone idle.They gave him a lot of stick over it and exercised their right,as HIS personal trainers ( with insider information that the local gym had sadly brought in the retrievers because of financial difficulties ) to lick him back in to shape.Having had a 7 day break from commentating - he called it a Scottish Respiratory Disorder ( a wee cough ) they unfortunately were barking up the wrong tree and Andrew seized the moment of confusion,turned it to his advantage and realized that in a 400 metre hurdles event neither Olive or Mabel would get over the finishing line as neither are lap dogs, despite liking to take the lead ! Because of broadcasting schedules they are also  quite phased by participating in track and field events at such an undogly hour.It's clearly a bone of contention between them so let's hope they don't weight too long before Andrew is vetted by his two adorable K9 coaches Olive and Mabel and given the all clear to get on the rowing machine They tried to inspire and encourage him by commenting on how good he looked in his 80's shell suit but sadly that went straight to his head and made him feel as popular as a chalk salesman at a snooker tournament.Trying to drown out their persuasive hounding of him by switching the vacuum cleaner in to carpet mode so that the noise of the powered roller beating the carpet would distract them failed completely. Hot under the collar from concealing his latest secret from them he revealed the truth - he was addicted to telling bad jokes.He asked them where do Spanish cats go for solitude and when they said " dunno " he replied " Catalonia ".See what i mean ! Quick as a flash he remembered his rowing training course, he's had intensive training for it for nearly 10 minutes and when the rowing instructor asked him to sum up the training course in one word,He said " Oarsome " .Having released enough Endorphines to fill an Olympic swimming pool he Mabel and Olive are feeling on top of the world now and the only thing that's getting them down is........ GRAVITY !  Having pushed through the pain barrier Andrew has become so zoned out and convinced that his high intensity regime has prepared him for the ultimate challenge - tying his OTHER shoelace.As with all top athletes he understands the importance of nutrition in sport and has been secretly doing a PhD in Sports Nutrition ( being a commentator ) and has reluctantly disclosed the footage of his latest research seminar with his colleagues which has left him feeling a bit blue and rather alienated.He's the one holding the vegetable.   https://youtu.be/TBRCZLzn5pM
Excellent! Platinum it is!
🐶🐶😃😂😁😀😊 Love it Love it Love it and Love Olive and Mabel, thanks again Andrew and Stay Safe at the Gym, Stay Safe Everyone 😨☺😊
Wonderful!!! 😊 Thanks!
HAHAAAAHAHAHA!! Too many hilarious moments to mention--I enjoyed each one!! Thank you once again!!!! <3
The "juice and smoothie bar" (water bowls) was hi-larious!
I soooo look forward to your videos!   This one was hilarious!
So cute ..👍💕
Brilliant. Keep 'em coming please🤣xxx
Paused at the right moment at 1:31. Love Olive's face 👀😍😜🐾
The sticks🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Mr Cotter, how do you keep from laughing, those sweet faces watching you intently. Now, I expect to see a work-out video with the 3 of you next.
4 dislikes? Insane. These pups and Andrew are priceless. 😁🐾🐾👏👏👏
OMG, so glad the three of you are back with another video to make my day!  Thank you for always putting a smile on my face!
Perfect timing! Thank you, thank you, thank you xx
Mr. Cotter dogs are so funny.  The comments are good too.   Hugs to all three. Virginia in Ohio USA
A gym. Open in lock down? The Police will be notified immediately!
Sign me up for Ladies Day. 😊😊😊
Absolutely charming thank you to Andrew, Olive and Mabel😃
Hilarious ! Thank you so much
Aww.... Happy New year guys, so lovely to have you back. Those two lovely ladies don't need a gym membership they're gorgeous as they are. C'mon now, a bit of body pawsotivity wouldn't go a miss. Love the ripples in Olive's coat❤️🐾🤗
Mr. Cotter, I think you just pulled a fast one on those girls. But that's okay...it was to the benefit of all of us. Much love & gratitude from Kentucky in a weary U.S.💙🌿💚
Again, Andrew, you’ve sold me (on the membership with Olive and Mabel)!!  It was definitely the play-balls that did it!  Quite the salesman, you!!  JDBurns
Covid & the cold make me rely on YouTube exercise videos. THIS was the kick I needed not to skip today's.  If Olive and Mabel can workout inside, so can I!
Brilliant. Love this xxx
Platinum it is 😂
I love the ear perk at the mention of biscuit.
From America 🇺🇸 thank you for the smiles!
Mr. Cotter this is one of my favorites.
Love it!
Bunnie is safe. Well, relatively speaking.
Nice gym 😃😎
Too funny.
Thank you! As a gym membership dropout, I love it!!
Next thing Olive & Mabel will be spamming our instas with Boombod detox tea sponsored posts
Guide dog Michelle is enjoying the videos and book! Big woofs!
Facilities second to none there ladies. The swimming pool is particularly impressive.
I have missed these so much.  Such healing medicine.
Love the stick rack. 😂 Olive’s coat looks curly. Did she just have a dip in the pool?  Lily’s in for the platinum package as well, though her vet has recommended Kong 🎾 balls, because the felt on Penn, or Wilson tennis balls caused some wear on one of her teeth.
200 a month!? Outrageous!
Haha! This was the best! Happy New Year! 🥳
Swanky swimming pool haha 😂
I love Olive and Mabel 🥰 thank you Andrew, for making my day.
Awwww Mr Cotter. You have outdone yourself this time. Such cleverness & cuteness all at the same time. I am laughing out loud and want to hug all of you. Can I be in your family? It looks so cool & fun. Lol ......💞💞💞💞🐶🐶🐶🐶
Mabel looks so disappointed to start with 😅 Love these two, or should I say three 👏👏
Free weights = assorted sticks :D You have outdone yourself with the script and props this time!  Lovely, thank you!
This one really got me 😂😂😂🌟🤣🤣✨
Thank you , you really do not know how this has cheered me up 👑🥰🐾❤️👍
Perfect!
Welcome back Olive, Mabel, and gym owner Mr. Cotter!!
LOVE
I would only be hanging out at the smoothie bar!
New Years fitness resolutions? Go for it ladies! 😂❤️😂
👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻
Genius! They signed up without the monogrammed towel sweetener! Nicely done sir. I suggest you get yourself a fox costume. Oh, yes.
Better than Netflix
Just brilliant! Well done 😁
I know you are looking for alternative revenue while in lockdown, but selling gym memberships?  Loved the free weights, and the juice bar area.  🤣
I love those 2 ... well done Andrew on another brilliant video ... had a good laugh
These videos were the only positive thing to occur during the Covid19 era!!
"Pretty much just an hour of Downward Dog." BWAH HA HA HA HA!!!
The glittery eyes at the mention of a biscuit...........you had them locked in then, excellent marketing tool Mr Cotter.
Seems like your move went pretty well then. Glad to see it.  Like your new gym facilities.  REALLY like your yoga mat!
Even my ears perked up when you mentioned biscuit!
Please Mr. Cotter, please never stop. 🐶🐶💜💜😘😘
The swimming pool!!!! It’s like the pond situation all over again... 😂
Ladies, can I just say one thing. Don't bother joining a gym because; let's face it, as well as being expensive, exercise I mean is just SOOO undignified, apart from catching a squirrel or two of course. Much better to have a nice walk with Mr C, playing with a ball and then back home for a light lunch🍗 😋.
Brilliant and hilarious! I just finished your book and enjoyed reading the backstory and behind-the-scenes lives of these two lovely ladies.
❤️ Hahaha 😂🤣 omg, they are so precious even when you’re insulting them!  Go figure. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Another fantastic video! I’m reading your book at the moment and loving it. You have a real talent for comedy! Can’t get enough of the three of you!
😮 A Juice Bar!  We don’t have a Juice Bar at our YMCA.  Just a couple of vending machine selling highly inappropriate sugary sodas and sports drinks at an outrageous fee!  Sign me up!
They are so precious the way they look at you!  Very funny video!
200 a month and only one rubber ball! Sign me up.
Missed ya'llllll
Hooray.!! The gang is back. Lockdown depression has been lifted. That looks a very much loved bunny, not personal equipment.!!
The juice and smoothie bar 1:02 🤣
Genius as always. Ps congratulations on your Mastermind win, saw it on TV the other day!!
Absolutely made my day,(here in the U.S). Thank you. ☺
These short films of Olive and Mabel have been a real lifeline. I always look forward to a new video coming out. Thanks for giving us something to laugh at. Bravo!
Their faces are so cute 😂😭❤️🐕🐕
Thank you thank you. Another  hoot. 😂
Oh yes! Here we go....2021! 🥳👍
Classic!  So good to see the girls and hear your voice! Thank you! Keep well.
Where did you  get the cloth rabbit? I think my pupperoo whould love this
Luxury pool🤣🤣🤣
Thank you so much for yet more delights and even better on a manky Monday!
Lovely 😍💋 💝💖❤️
Love this!
Ah ha! I’ve been duped, bloody brilliant! The kids play their part so well, I was anticipating the signature! I guess that’s a bit of a leap, even for blue bloods!
Hilarious! Burst into laughter... Just what I needed after a day of hard work!!!! Still laughing 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
Glad that these two bonny faces are gracing our screens again.😘
The juice bar looked great! Haha!
These videos never disappoint! Love them all!
Need lovely 😍💋 💝💖❤️
Another Chef- d’oeuvre!
Should have sold them the diamond package. Girls always go for diamonds.
They are so beautiful 🤩🤩
Freaking hilarious!! I see you found the swimming pool!! Miss my lovable labs!! Thanks so much, needed that 🐶🌞💗
Welcome back lovely ladies, missed you both so much.   Book was great, eagerly waiting for more videos.
Impressive stick, er, free weights section.
Glad to see that no rabbits were left behind! As the last video on YT was moving house. Lovely happy Hogmanay to Olive and Mabel and Andrew. Many thanks.
Oh my smiling heart!
Thank you from the States.  We needed a dose of Olive and Mabel!
Thanks for the  video. From  JDS in AZ
Do they need a personal trainer  ??
Bless you and thank you for the loud belly laugh!
😂😂😂cheered me up 😘😘
So clever!
Just... Delightful ♥️
Looking forward to updates on their progress on the treadmill!
Welcome back Olive and Mabel, oh and you too Andrew !
Oh joy of joys, you 3 here again and jollity abounds, love it! 😂⭐️♥️🏆
Good things come to dogs who "weight."
I love it - biscuit in front of nose on treadmill! That might work for me too! Thank you for continuing to cheer us up!
Excellent work Mr Cotter! Will there be any spin classes for O & M ? ..... asking for a friend.
I see you’ve found the pool...ha ha!
I love their expressions and sudden intense focus at 1:25 when presumably they spot the "platinum package"...
Thank you for another laugh out loud video.  Also just finished your book. EXCELLENT!!!!!
How will they find time when they're busy with their dating app ?
Welcome back, Mr. Cotter!
Dogs are so forgiving....
Ps. Mattdoesfitness needs to rate this sick setup
Two very attentive ladies...all they wanted was rubber balls 😆
Olive and Mabel are back!!!....no sign of a Spin Bike but the weights area is classic😀
This has just put the BIGGEST smile on my face. Thank you so much for sharing these beautiful girls with the world!
Rack of sticks to run after, very good cardio!
Just what we needed today, Olive and Mabel ❤ Thanks Andrew, stay safe..
The freebies are never worth what you pay up front! Sad to see celebrities squander their wealth so early on in their careers like this! 😪
Just finished the book Andrew , thoroughly enjoyed it . We have a member of the more frenzied branch of the family but there are definitely  some strong familiarities 😊
You never fail to impress with Olive and Mable what,  I’ve spelt your name wrong? I can see you’re going to be a awkward member...
NOW this year is off to a swimming start! What is life without Olive and Mable?
thanks for a moment of something resembling "normalcy"... 🐾💜
Love it 🥰
Hi Boys 😍💋 💝💖♥️❤️
Is that the new garage - sorry gym?  I see the stuffed rabbit made it.
Just make sure they clean the equipment after each use. I needed a dose of you and the girls. Thanks!
I just spit out my drink when you showed the different sized sticks. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 You sir are a creative genius!
“I’ll sign for your. You’re pretty busy”. 🤣
I would give my life savings to know what dogs are thinking when they are being talked to  -  and appear to be listening LOL
:)
Is this part of the new year's resolution? I'd like to see a follow-up video, please. Will they make it to the "catching the squirrel" level? The suspense is already killing me ; ) (edited because of unforgivable typos)
Wonderful😀😀😀thank you🇨🇦☮️
Excellent gym services Mr Andrew!!
Amazing!  So good to see we're keeping our weight down during lockdown.  Thank you Andrew and Team for a good laugh.
they really twitched when you said biscuit
Those faces are so darn cute!! And always the content is a good laugh😆😆
Andrew, you're a genius.  Thanks to you all for bringing us some much-needed laughs!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Loved every single  minute of your content
Don't do it ladies. Gym  memberships are such a rip off. Just keep trying to catch those squirrels! ❤
Thank you Olive, Mabel & Andrew x
Comedy par (paw) excellence.
😁 joy
“Downward dog” - love it. 😂
I wanna hug them dogs so bad 😭
Hahahhaha

I thought this was actually going to be a tour of a home gym but I was pleasantly surprised
