the breaking down of bloodline has started from here..?
Cody Rhodes vs jey Uso  Jimmy Uso vs CM Punk  John cena & Kevin Owens vs Roman Reigns vs Sami Zayn
This is aging so well!!
Crazy how this finna play out again 😂
Jimmy is finally getting back into it
Jimmy should do this again
starts off "i always got you" from jey to roman, ended "i got you" jimmy to jey. good stuff
I gotta do this
Jey Uso And Roman Reigns: (Talking) Roman Reigns: There Ain't No Day One No More! (Shoves Jey In The Face) Roman Reigns: There Ain't No Day One No More You Understand Me? Get Out Of My Ring! (Shoves Jey Again) Jimmy Uso: (Super Kicks Roman) Michael Cole: Oh No! Jimmy Just Super Kicked Roman! Pat McAfee: Jimmy What Did You Do? Jey Uso: What Are You Doing!? Jey Uso: Why Are You Doing!? (Grabs Jimmy By The Shirt) Jey Uso: (Claps His Hands) Why Did You Do That!?  Jey Uso: Hey! You Can't Do That! You Hear Me? Jey Uso: We Gotta Be Better Than That! Jey Uso: Why Did You Do That!? Jimmy Uso: Listen To Me! Jimmy Uso: Listen To Me! Jimmy Uso: Listen To Me Uce! Jimmy Uso: I'm Doing What You've Should've Done A Long Time Ago! Jimmy Uso: I Got You! Jimmy Uso: (Super Kicks Roman Again) Michael Cole: Oh My God! Jimmy Uso: Ahhhhh! Jimmy Uso: Ahhhhhhh! Jimmy Uso: Come On! 👇
Last time this storyline mattered
Jimmy should win a championship
Kick heard around the world
Tears........🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

Big brother  lil brother  Twin don't matter  if u know you know
Look at how good Jeys acting was before HHH’s insistence to bring him down to the Yeet Man.
They legit dropped the ball on Jimmy after this
Yeah but still made no sense for jimmy to come right back two months later to turn on jey
Heymans Reaction to seeing Roman get kicked was priceless 😂😂
😮Go yeet
The OMG from Michael Cole just added more severity of the second super kick
So technically it should've been Main event Jimmy because he was the man who started the thing right?
That primal scream Jimmy let loose. That was cathartic for him.
Let it out Jimmy
Jimmy uso such😂😂
Jimmy your soul coming out you scream to hard you good yeet😮😮😮
"I'm doing what you should have done a long time ago!"Man,that hits hard.

This was so good they totally runied Jimmy by trying to push Jey
Roman stinks
this was peak bloodline. after this and the whole fiasco with jimmy turning on jey and the new "otc" arc has really devalued the storyline, but this was when it was absolutely perfect.
Big Jim told that the biggest moment in your career is because of me.  It's hundred 💯 true ☝️
• "Im doin what you shouldve done a long time ago"  My favorite line... gave me chills
Lol
Wwe is fake but fun
Beta eu  vou gritar
oTc and Jimmy bonding ❤
I can’t tell if that kick was real or fake
If this would have been in America the crowd would have been even more insane
Jimmys eyes say it all "Don't. Touch. My. Brother!"
But they messed up big time when jimmy turned on jey for nothing
This was the most satisfying scene of this storyline
Sucks we didn't get jimmy vs roman it was set up perfectly.
Roman sold those kicks well.
This is the Jimmy we need.  “The Screaming Jimmy”
My my times have really changed now.....
Jimmy say he the only one left who sticks to reigns. He forgot about this moment 😂
Still doesn't make sense
Jimmy and Roman have the most weirdest relationship in the bloodline    When Jimmy returned in 2021, he was against Roman, then he eventually joined Roman, then he was the first out of the usos to turn on Roman, then he went back to Roman     It’s like they have a love hate relationship,
to this day that “I GOT YOU” followed by the alpha scream, it’s GOLD
I'm here after jimmy returned to help Roman 😂😂😂🔥💯   anyone else here?
Jimmy uso did wit este ele
If Jimmy returns, I want to see him have a successful solo run like what Jey is currently enjoying now.
that was a primal scream heard around the world i felt that as a sister
Damn this is history for you
0:51 I got you
kamu seharusnya sudah melakukannya sejak lama
This where the bloodline story peaked
0:52 0:09
😢😢😢😢😢
Roman had it coming it was only a matter of time. 😂😂😂
Too bad this moment meant nothing afterwards
0:15
0:58
They dropped the ball by having Jimmy turn his back on Jey
Jimmy should've had a successful solo run after this.  Instead, they made him comedy relief and flop every week which was stupid.  His 2k rating fell considerably also.  Dude is far too talented to flop.  I hope he comes back, gets revenge on the new Bloodline and becomes ruthless.
Jimmy's Samoan War Cry woke him up
Jimmy USO love Jey USO that is why he destroyed Roman reign
Jimmy snapped and the Scream/Roar was emotional
Bring back THIS Jimmy
amazing
1 Year Ago Today 27th May 2023
USOs need to reunite
Why’d You Do That’s 0:25
and you pwople say saudi crowd are always dead smh
Coming back to this now hits different. Why oh why did they ruin jimmys character by having him randomly turn heel again and join the bloodline not even two months later. I’ll never understand it
The Usos always were mistreated by Roman. Can you really blame Jimmy for the 2 superkicks?
I don't know why roman always gets betrayed by his own family
"Ahhhhhhhh hhhhhhh, COME ON!"
Romaan reings is a timid man
Not even a year later and Jimmy is still in the bloodline and Jey is not.
Gave me goosebumps
Jimmy should've stayed outta the bloodline. He was always the one to have Jeys back no matter what, and always stood up to Roman. Now he's just Romans lap dog.
Jimmy gud job
all this rage and still joined back roman like nothing happened. Jimmy is mentally confused fr 😂😂
this the jimmy Uso that needs to be on display. not the punching bag version.
still don t get why jimmy  re joined  this moment was a waste
Still never made sense for Jimmy to turn back. Wwe ruined a perfect moment
Gave me chills
so are we just going to pretend this didn't happen and jimmy and roman are cool again ?
Thats the kind’ve older brother we all need. Lol
Womp womp
Came here because Jimmy said in the promo he accepted Jeys challenge "I told you i got you" nice call back to this
The Crowd exploded when Jimmy Turned on Roman 10 months ago.
And then we flushed all this great storyline down the toilet because we just NEEDED Rock v Roman for the championship
Jimmy Uso Standing Up To Roman Reigns Just Made More Invested In This Storyline Until He Joined The Bloodline Again
So we’re jus gonna ignore the fact that this happened and now jimmy and roman are cool again
WEATHER YOU LIKE OT OR NOT JIMMY USO IS THE ORIGINAL 1. HE LOOKS AFTER HIS BROTHERS. BIG USO
This is the best moment in WWE history
Meant nothing, Jimmy came back to heel
great Story,but Bloodline still not done.
That "I got you" was just like a brother doing a favor for another brother
Still can't rock with Jimmy rejoining. But this was epic.
Only for him to rejoin after all that
This moment now feels like nothing after Jimmy got back in the Bloodline
That is a special moment to remember for a long time in the WWE to remember to come since 2023 and beat Roman reigns in Money Bank and pin Roman reigns from Jey Usos and Jimmy Usos was a special storyline in the history as a team together and the greatest tag team of all time winning tag team championship and Main Event paperviews for a long time just like your legendary career family amazing job and congratulations Jimmy Usos and Jey Usos will be a Hall of Famer very soon 🎉🎉❤ all the blessings memories and the fans is very happy to see the greatest superstars of all time greatest wrestler ever 😎 proud of you and a great dancer celebrating birthdays all the best wishes to you lolay and responsible and important and special people well done when you retired we all will say thank you and God bless you congratulations 🎉   to you and your family our favorite WWE wrestler of all time greatest to make history breaking records that is a moment
1:02
I can't believe they wasted such a good moment all for Jimmy to turn his back on his brother.
Roman sold the hell out of that super kick
Crowd reaction was awesome even the microphnones couldnt handle the screams in the second kick
Jimmy screaming after the kick is so charismatic
0:54 YEAHH 0:56 YEAAAAH
Usos send up
This moment was a waste now that Jimmy is back with Roman why did they bother with this script ?
Nigth of champions Titandron
Johann Saldivar Román Reigns wedding propes kiss jimmy jey uso pual heyman titandon
And this storyline went...........nowhere after this, Roman just forgets about this apparently
Sorry kids, watch on 0.25x slow he just touched his feet on his head, it was an act
roman reigns has jimmy has in the hell in the cell and took it the head jey he said i quit jimmy has he promise
Awesome moment.....and then summerslam happened
Nah that kick was personal 😂.
0:09 OHHHHHHHH
I use 2 like cartoons
Then they ruined this after summerslam.
One of the best face turns in WWE history. Which of course, was completely undone by having Jimmy betray his brother Jey. And now, he's once again Roman's lackey.
Jimmy went from that to stabbing his brother in the back and wanting back in 😂
That “I got you” hits diff when you got an older bro. Loyalty over anything
What was the point of Jimmy abandoning the Bloodline when he ended up coming back anyway! Such a waste of time
Over milked story line now , was great at the beginning
This went nowhere
Jimmys i got you hurts more now knowing they did absolutely nothing with it, all that character development for nothing
👏👏👏👏
How jimmy is still in the bloodline after this..they jumped the shark without even jumping
The fact that we didn’t get Jimmy getting a world title match was so disappointing. I get Jey was the main part of the civil war,but imo if they’re gonna go with heel Jimmy then he needs to be a loner that’s just cold and menacing. Shows no mercy and isn’t aligned with anyone of the bloodline.
This is the moment the storyline peaked. Now it's back to being just another boring storyline. The return of CM Punk and Randy Orton is going to be more interesting than the Bloodline
awesome moment. we now seeing its just downhill from this and when the bloodline civil war match
Great moment ruined by dumb storytelling afterwards. Man is back with Roman like this didn’t happen
what a waste of time all this was 4 months after this jimmy comes running back to roman
why did jimmy kick roman in the first place when he joined the bloodline again
Undoubtedly the best storyline of modern Era I mean basically since they went Pg
0:54 That scream from Jimmy, just told the story. All the emotions from Jey becoming the right hand man, to him aligning with the bloodline, all exploded right out.
SUCK THAT KICK😂😂
BEST STORY LINE SINCE THE MEGA POWERS EXPLODING
And it meant nothing
My My times have changed....
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jimmmy uso:AHHGGGGGGGG......AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH😂😂😂😂😂😂
The way when Roman Reigns said there's no  day one no More 🤣😂
People who had a wrestling game and played as roman  when they heard the streak was over the switched to jey and in the game they out roman out for 15 or less or mores week then like
Looks like the tribal chief has no tribe anymore, it was only a matter of time before someone kicked Roman Reigns back to the time when he couldn't cut a decent promo.   Actually even today he's not very good at promos even though he's improved a bit since back when John Cena used to own Roman Reigns in terms of mic skills.
Giving what’s going on with The Bloodline currently this moment has kinda lost all its impact. Unless they do something with Jimmy and Roman REAL SOON this was just a waste.
Wrestlemania 2024 - Roman Reigns (Undisputed WWE Universal Champion) vs. Jimmy Uso 0:52 😂😂😂
Crack number 2 of the bloodline
0:51 AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Roman Reigns & Solo Sikoa blew their opportunity to become the new Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champions, didn't they?
Yeah, and now somehow Jimmy is back with the bloodline, which makes absolutely zero sense, and Roman is pretty much acting like this didn't happen
Jimmy uso is right doing what you should have done a long time ago
He had super kick Roman Reigns in the face twice
How the hell jimmy started that and now he's in the bloodline
And now all of this was for nothing
This moment was ruined by poor booking
BRO DID THIS FOR NOTHING🤣🤣🤣
Annnnd we wasted this
Jimmy kick Ronan reigns
No one remembers this match for the match they remember it for Jimmy super kicking Roman!!!!
😢😢😢 why 0:03
Then he went right back to Roman 💀
Tribal Chief sold the hell out of that second kick
Now Jimmy has turned on Jey and join Bloodline again. Messed up storyline
It's so dumb that Jimmy later turned on Jey after doing this.
QycuniPercente Right now WWE WWE WWE Jey July Jey July Jey Uso WWWE WWE
0:07
Oh yes kick his face because everyone hates Roman Reigns including me.
It sucks because this video doesn’t feel the same after 4 months
Jimmy is getting fat
Eish the usos attitude
Don't touch the twins
This Bloodline storyline has gotten so wonky since then. Jimmy turned on Roman and now he’s back in the bloodline. This storyline is well past it’s prime now
Cinema
Looking back at this moment now makes me sick. What was the point of this moment…
My name. is Roman😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Roman the best
This is where I lose interest in this whole story they’re trying to tell.   Jimmy turns on Roman first, than costs Jey the match, than wants back into the bloodline
Never been prouder of Jimmy.
Who is here after payback 2023
Only for Jimmy to turn on his brother anyways! Because he didn’t want Jey to by like Roman. Stupid storyline in the end which keeps going lol
Ishan Chavan kehta hai KYA?!! Fardeen Sheikh kehta hai Hey Bhagwaan yeh kya kar diya tune? Piyush Kapoor kehta hai Kya baat hai?
I didn’t notice before I love that Jey said “ we’re supposed to be better than that” just giving extra layers to the story and jimmy following it up with “I got you” and delivering the final blow so that his brother wouldn’t but…..we see how that turnd out in the end but it was still good lil piece to the story
Who's here after Jimmy Uso Heel turn.
Jey vs Jimmy coming soon
Momment was runied
And then jimmy became corrupted
0:52   ~
All for the WWE to backtrack this amazing moment. What an L.
Jimmy’s scream gave me goosebumps
Thank you Jimmy
hey  Jimmy  about  your  throat  or brother  got mad  about  that  finger  let you  know  is now
This is the part of the story that gets retconned
And here we are, a couple of months later and all the character development jimmy got was just flushed for shock value
Michelle Rodriguez did WHAT to Drew McIntyre?!: WWE Night Of Champions Highlights
Coming back to this after summerslam hits different...
I bet everyone $50 that Sami Zayn was happy for what jimmy did to Roman
Quede demasiado confundido luego de saber lo qué pasó con la pelea de Román reigns vs jey uso, no tiene sentido ni lógica xd.
Who’s here after he betrayed Jey?
K Jimmy USOs super kick Roman and jey uoso but jey USOs super kick roman and solo
This was one of the greatest moments in wrestling history and they've crapped on it already.
NoC: Jimmy Uso betrays Roman Reigns  SummerSlam: Jimmy Uso betrays Jey Uso
The Tribal Cheat This Championship is tainted . Roman cant win cleanly . Even if he does now because wwe will probably try that . It doesn't matter . He cheated guys who had him beat until interference struck again . He's not the Tribal Cheif . He's the Tribal Cheat . Psthetic .
Like everybody saying this is all for nothing what was the The point in turning Jimmy face just to turn him heel again I mean don’t get me wrong I’m all in for an Uso feud but what’s the point of turning him heel again after he just turned face hart broken I loved The USO’s 😥😥😥😥
All for nothing. So disappointed
Jimmy did all of this for nothing 🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾
so this was all for nothing? smh man..
Aged like milk.
This is all just Illusion as of now. ☝🏽
And now Jimmy finally fell back in Line, and The Bloodline is reunited and stronger than Ever. Jey is Out. ☝🏽
Who came to watch this again after SummerSlam ?   "I'm doing what you should've done a long time ago... 🔥" I guess he meant it's my time now... 💔☝🏾 It'll be your own family sometimes.
he has lot more explaining to do now that he helped roman retain against jey
Well, this aged VERY POORLY.
So like. What was even the point of this now?
And WWE ruined it by having Jimmy turn on Jey.
Delete this off the platform it’s now meaningless
So turning on Roman was All for Nothing.
Jimmy​ Betray​ Jey​ Summer​Slam 😢😢
I come back to this for the  scream
Mil respetos para Jimmy uso ☝️
Nice❤
What would have the usos do if they would have won
Wait where was this night of champions?

I want jimmy uso gimmick to be pyschotic maniac who hunts on champion.
Mui bien echo no aguanto que humille así hermano
I wonder how will this script end.....Writer is really giving us hard time digesting things... BUT the storyline seems pretty interesting though
😮
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jay was holding it in for😅dear life (jimmy) I got u 😅too funny
The story line is incredible between this, the usos represent each other n love how tight these 2 are
Yooooo when did wrestling become good again?
That scream from Jimmy was genuine! All that pent up rage and frustration was let out finally in the biggest way possible. At that point in time.
Jimmy screamed "Listen to me" and the crowd stopped chanting to listen
Bruh whoever helped the Usos with their acting deserves a MASSIVE thank you. The fact they are able to do story work without a mic and just "candid audio" through the cameras is the hardest stuff to do. I'm so excited to see where this goes.
When roman is off the roids he becomes Rowman the water buffalo
Jimmys scream after that 2nd kick, he KNEW he was free then!  Great storyline..
In The Rocks voice: Roman the number of people that heard that Superkick was the Millions!   Fans: Millions
The crowd’s reaction + Jimmy’s scream = simply perfect
Oh😂
0:46 that's true ... Jey should have done this a long time ago .. this is Jey's story ... And Jimmy is trying to do whatever it takes to get his brother to the top and protect from roman and the big snake Paul Heyman who is the reason for all of this
Jimmy had finally reached his breaking point.. he damn near decapped Roman with that Headshrinker kick.. fam went full fledge Headshrinker 😂
“ I’m doing what you should’ve done a long time ago” 3 weeks later “so guess what you out, and I’m out too”
Roman ಇಸ್ ಬ್ಯಾಕ್
0:51
Love it when he told his brother I got you and super kicked Roman again
I just noticed since Jey is the 2nd youngest brother out of 3. Jey has more gray in his beard than Jimmy or Solo. All that grinding and hustling really is taking a toll on the man.
0:09 0:46
if only this happened with an actual audience.. this sounds like tna-crowd
WWE-thank you for giving us one of the best storylines in years. This was a very wonderfully crafted story and it made 4 people (Sami, Jimmy, Jey, and Solo) stars.
I can't believe that Roman didn't just "Hulk Up." What a dummy!
Who else is watching this after Jey kicked Roman
Listen to the crowd I've never heard that in years that just gave me goosebumps
Who got the biggest reaction jimmy or jey
"Oh my god" that was pure gold from michael cole
I'm proud to be a wrestling fan
well he did it now 🤣
*L🤣L*
Who's here after Jey did the same thing to Roman on WWE Smackdown tonight?
"I got you" 😢  I am enjoying the hell out of this storyline. I hope it ends with Jey defeating Roman for the title at SummerSlam
And now jey did too..
Whole full circle moment cause Jimmy wasn’t going for this who bloodline thing in the beginning 😂 and bro not going for it now
Super saiyan Jimmy!!!
Roman is trash
I like you uce
I love you Jimmy you did a great job uce
I would have thought it would be Jey to pull the trigger
Goat Jimmy Uso
Kind of wish we always saw the crowd - while reactions aren’t as wild as they used to be it’s still nice to see the immediate cheers if there are any
Jimmy's scream was awesome
RELEASE THE KRAKEN !! 😂😂😂.. WELL, AT LEAST HIS CHIN GOT ACKNOWLEDGE !! 🤷🏾‍♂️
Fitting since Jimmy originally acknowledged Roman to protect Jey, that he protected his brother again. Such good stuff
0:47 0:56
I gotta respect Jimmy for super kicking Roman because Roman shouldn’t pushed his own cousin Jey 🤷🏾‍♂️

We'll witness the biggest Face Turn of Roman Reigns when everyone from his family will leave or betray him... It started with Heyman it will end with Heyman... And we'll have the privilege to Acknowledge Our New Big Dog ❤️🔥
Good
Amazing
Jey ❤️🔥
Jimmy Uso: My dawg Sami was right all along!!!
I want Roman reign to give a nice lesson to Jimmy by beating him so hard…
Greatest storyline ever in wrestling
Nice
That's great karma returns to roman reigns 🎉
Faaarrkn McDonalds....lovin it....good entertainment right there people,brilliant 🤟
The emotions i felt as soon as i saw Jimmy yelling after those two kicks made me felt like I was going to cry, I felt his pain through the torment he had in the bloodline when Roman was snapping at him every time
Jimmy kicked Roman the first time for Jey…  But that second one? Nah, he did that for himself
Wait I thought its live wrestling 😢😢😢😢
Suuu Messi better through
Great
Nice video
Awesome
imagine if this kick happened at backlash with that crowd🤯
That 2nd kick was legit jimmy wanted to kick romans head off😂😅😂
Jey Uso = acts wild but really quiet Jim Uso = acts quiet but really wild. You got to see the hints when they turned on Sami, Jimmy starts and Jey will finish it.
DAMN! Jimmy got them double tap J'S on!
Dislike both reigns and usos... they absolutely do not deserve the champion belts... they kicking eachother is the best thing to watch
Imagine Jey winning 2024 royal rumble and Solo winning 2023 Money in the Bank and have it all culminate at Wrestlemania 2024 in the main event against The Tribal Chief. WWE have  a chance to make a megastar out of Solo jush like how they did back then with( Randy, Lesnar and Batista)
Nice
Damn man. Why can't WWE write storylines like this for everyone? It's not hard.
Nice video
The KICK heard around the world
Goosebumps bro especially after that second kick...he put alot of thought into the second one and made his decision 🔥
That was epic
Tears of joy 😢
Bloodlines break
I’ve been waiting for this
vonjy tahina 0 seconds ago finally, I start to like watching wwe wrestling again after the too repetitive scenario
This story was outlined beautifully 🔥💯🔥
Nice video😮
Roman finally got what he had coming to him
Nice video
Roman deserved that one 😂
this is best storyline all time
Lifetime of all time
I like to hear what Sammy Zanes thoughts on that display as a spectator... Not of a storyline. KO aswell.
Magical reality
good
That scream, tho! That was a scream of freedom!
Solo tho i felt for u man
Wonder how this plays out bc this is like Hulk joining Hall and Nash it just don't get old. I'm just as hyped as the first time when i watch it over
Jimmy needs to cost Roman the title at some point
😳😳😳😳😳
I got goosebumps when jimmy kicked him.... 4 Million views wow!!! in a week
Very very goooood
The look on Paul Heyman's face PRICELESS!!!!!!😅😅
Roman Deserves It, He Sucks!
J'attendais ça depuis 🇬🇦🥳🥳🥳❤️ jimmy
💛💛💛💛💛👏👏👏👏👏
This was magical One of the greatest scene created.god bless you .amazing
I must’ve watched this 100x This is one of my favorite moments this year so far! 💪🏼😤
Usos ika poonakaalu loading eee 🤬🤬
I hope it will be Roman Reigns (with Paul Heyman and Solo Sikoa)  vs. Jimmy Uso (with Jey Uso) for the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion at MONEY IN THE BANK (2023)
Good for Jimmy and Jay now they can go back to the original Usos 💕❤️❤️💕
They betrayed,and they will will be banished from the family, including their children...
Who cam reply that kick 1000 times😂🤷🏽‍♂️🙌🏽
Jimmy rocked Roman so hard, he got to meet his ancestors.
This Peak WWE 👍👍👍👍
this was one of the best moments of WWE for a long time! Hope Roman will fall.... every week the same, he sitting backstage and relax with the title & people should watch this xD Now we got more action again & after he do this to Roman i like the Usos more then the whole time before ^^
That superkick was awesome! hahaha i love this stiryline
braxtonlaburay
i lov you
Roman is so insane drowning in his own power. Literally his worst enemy
Perfect reply 👌👌
That second pop rivaled Sami’s pop at the rumble
Pure Samoan came out of jimmy right there
Kicked Roman out of the ring 😅😂
0:45 "I'm doing, what you should've done a long time ago! I got you!"
Classic storytelling.
This officially has more views then samis betrayal, incredible.
Smack down should be a good one tonight.
Roman sold this so well, i can imagine all the Usos in the back with Sami and Kevin having a blast looking back at this enjoying the storyline they are putting out
That primal scream he let out when he superkicked Roman the 2nd time. That's a couple years of pent up frustration released in 5 seconds. We've all felt that one time or another when we've kicked a door, punched a wall,  screamed a tangent laced with swears and blaspheme. Clark Griswold from Christmas Vacation would be proud.
🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥
Finally Beginning of Bloodline Split !!!
Call every member from the Anoa'i family overrated & overpushed all you want, but their natural entertainment skills are undeniable.
I love this story mirroring itself. Jey joins the bloodline to protect jimmy. Jimmy betrays the bloodline to protect jey.
I know it's all story but Roman is a bully
This story line was great but it has ran it course. Hopefully it will be the end soon
That "OH My God" from Michael Cole after the 2nd superkick is legendary
😥😥😥😥
Usos have enough, Roman deserve that.
0:55 Now thats a primal samoan yell
When Jimmy yelled after that second kick, i felt that shyt! That was a hell of a release!
This already has more views than Sami’s betrayal and that happened months ago now.
This storyline proves that Cody should have won at mania.
FXCK YOU JIMMY FXCK YOU JIMMY FXCK YOU JIMMY FXCK YOU JIMMY  🤬
Tomorrow is going to be war.i don't know what roman reigns will do.
This was absolutely amazing.i can't even believe it.
The Bloodline is done.
Nice nd greatest kick of all time 😂
I thought it was going downhill but man.. it has turned into a saga of Homer in the epicness.
😭😭😭😭😭end the bloodlin
He did it for The Rock ?
I just watched it and wow
😓😓😓
i replay this 10x at least a day on repeat it just so satisfying
bye  tribal chief haha
Nice
He deserved it. 💯
This must be what sweet bliss feels like
Miss you Shield 😣 come back shield
That’s the “that’s the last time you abuse my brother”
Jimmy roaaaarsss 😤😤😤
I got brothers I would of done the same thing for my brothers too.
Sweet jim music
Sami hit chair at the back of Roman Jimmy superkick at the face of roman
Love how, after Jimmy says, "Listen to me" the 3rd time, the ENTIRE STADIUM goes completely silent to hang on his next words "I'm doing what you shoulda done a long time ago, Use. I got YOU!!" and then ERUPTS after the second superkick.   Some of the most EPIC dramatic storytelling WWE has EVER pulled off!! Masterpiece story line!!!!
😮😮
Roman deserve jimmy super kicks😂
I come back to this video everyday still hyped up when Jimmy kicked Roman.
I love it
Ok....it's a 2 on 2 situation. I'm not putting the belt on either Uso. We drop the universal to somebody and we transition to a tag team program. This booking is stupid.
That foo is a sav 😮
Great storyline for sure.
Man up Jey. About time Jimmy.
Jimmy, the ultimate protector…he took all those pie faces and the second Roman layed his hands on Jey…he snapped 🔥
For the people who think bloodline saga is over or about to be over .. it won't be over any time soon! The day some tough dude beats roman is the day bloodline will officially end! And im sure that there are couple of months still left for that to happen! Oh and if solo dethrones him then it will be a banger!
I honestly thought Solo was gonna do it cuz he's so quiet no one would have seen that coming and solo are uso's brother . Solo should have done it and could have been a big push for Roman and Solo at summer slam . Usos are a TAG TEAM . Solo a singles wrestler makes all the sense
Roman had it coming
Can’t stop rewatching it. It’s been along time coming I been waiting and wondering which Uce would pull the trigger
Honestly speaking that's a great work from everyone. Jey was totally shocked, Heyman knows that things are going to be worst now, Jimmy has exploded and gave everything he was holding since all these times through his 2 super kicks and Roman the Man who is responsible for all these things.  I love Roman Reigns but I should accept the fact that this is what he deserves.  Greatest story telling ever and great heel work by Roman...
This is awesome 🤟🏼🦾
If premature ejaculation would have a face it would be roman reigns.
Can't wait for things to erupt on smackdown tomorrow night between usos & reigns
Roman sold those super kicks perfectly👏👏
Dam
0:09..0:53
This is how WWE drama works.
"I'm doing what you should have done a long time ago." So true.
Wwe fans: yeeeeeeeeessssssss
Romans time is now tik tok tik tok tik tok
Perfect
it's about time
them screams from jimmy WOW
Joe Anoa'i got what he deserved and it should of happened a long time ago  ❤
Jimmy Turned Into Godzilla After the Second Super Kick
Jimmy Uso Vs. Roman Reigns for the WWE Undisputed Universal Championship. Mark that down cause it’s coming.
Romans who life,past, present and future felt that kick 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Next week roman destroyed usos definitely 😂😂😂
These are OLD SCHOOL.STORY LINE UP bring something New
Iam full happy...😂😂
Sami Zayn planted the seeds & called it that segment with Jimmy 3 months ago when he told him about loyalty & finding a away out he got into his head & look where we're at very soon Jey will join & they'll probably say Sami was right about Roman amazing storyline telling.
Who would know how over the Usos, of all ppl, could be in 2023? Proof that when you inject a good story into the mix even if you don't believe certain performers can "act", it adds so much more emotion and importance.
I can't believe this, Unexpected movement WWE NOC   History movement Uso destroy Roman
Chills
"Jimmy what did you do???" One of the best lines during this segment
Finally a face turn from The Usos ❤
roman sold it good
Wow
Welcome to the Phase 4 of Bloodline Saga. Bloodline Civil War! Let's go!!
Honesty I was impressed that Jimmy had the guts to do that
Thanks for this video wwe ji
I was genuinley hoping roman and solo would win the belts and then we would see the bloodline go to war with each other for the belts
Bravissimi jey e jimmy usos
That roar of the crowd when jimmy hit that second kick 🙌🏻. Almost as loud as when Sami hit Roman with the chair.
Jimmys face at :15 lol priceless. He finally couldnt take it no more, had everything built up inside him and just completely lost it and super kicked roman. The emotion the drama it had it all.
Relex boyz this is only for triple  tag team champions match
Roman really sold that superkick to the face. He rolled out the ring and everything😂😂
lol Remember when y'all were mad af about Cody losing, saying the WWE didn't know what it was doing anymore...Looks like ya proved ya wrong once again
this is sooo good, i wanna re-watch the twilight saga😆
جمي بطل wwe  جي بطل العالمي في سمر سلام
everything went perfectly.
This was amazing
Is this his (Jimmy) Shawn Michaels moment? I remember growing up watching the Rockers and thought Marty Jenetti was the main the guy until he put him through the Barbers window💈   He went on, alongside Sherri and rest was history!
Shield is going to reunite soon..
Dolphziggeler wasted for WWE
Noooooo 😩
Nice kick damn tribal chief went flying out of the ring
It's about time Jimmy Uso fight back to protect themselves from Romans . WOW !
Good 👍👍👍
AWSUM
When Sami turned I watched it about 200 times. Now , Jimmy turns & I can’t stop watching it. Every single moment is pure cinema. Long term storytelling. & it isn’t even over!
Love to see enjoy it❤❤❤
Good for Jimmy!!
Finally the WWE has a modern era story line that can be called one of the greatest. This actually still all about Roman. He’s broken up with multiple groups dating back to the Shield.
It's about time
That scream bro was from heart
It was the I gotchu to jey from jimmy for me
I've watched this over a several times already. He kept his emotions close to his chest this entire time, and he just EXPLODED. PHENOMENAL and it's make me happy.
It’s about time!
I knew it was a reason jimmy always been my fav uce
Roman sold those two kicks absolutely perfect
😮😮😮😮 omg 😂
Now that the more I think of it...the more I want it to happen... I really want to be Cody to win the titles against Roman but a part of me is saying that would it be fitting that the two people who started this whole Bloodline thing (Roman and Jey) will be the ones fighting for that Championship with Jey winning it. It will be a poetic ending to an incredible years long storyline. 👌💯
Nice
JIMMY USO TOOK OUT THAT PIECE OF LEUKEMIA OF THE WWE WHEN HE SUPERKICKED HIM NOT ONCE BUT TWO TIMES!! THAT WAS AWESOME !!
Jey should of done that along time ago and i am glad that he snapped cause I would off snapped aswell told what to do all the time by Roman reigns 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I can't describe the amount of goosebumps I got when he said "I'm doing what u should have done along time ago. I got u!"
Roman Reigns got what he deserved.😈😈😈😈😈
My jaw completely drop 😮
FINALLY BEEN WAITING HOW LONG FOR THIS 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Brothers for ever that ist so ❤
Ive watched this so many times lol seriously one of the best moments ever. Its literally theater, a play in a wrestling ring. This honestly might be the best storyline I've ever seen. And im not some little kid, im 30. Been watching pro wrestling for 20+ years. Never seen storyline with so many layers and anticipation. They changed the game. This should be the new standard.
The USOS!  This storyline and its execution by everyone involved has been pure gold!
The End of Bloodline Break Up
Man not the family but all good things must come to an end 🤔
After this, my thoughts are that Roman will lose the titles (at some point) then solo and Heyman will turn on him, then Heyman will be mentoring Solo kicking off a feud with Roman
I wish Jey super kicked Roman instead of Jimmy
i feel like this is going to be a work… like I don’t know how yet but Jimmy costing Roman and Solo the tag titles will be part of the plan all along… idk how lol but it is
Y’all…the BL isn’t done YET this is a tease for Jey to turn. I can almost see Jimmy and Roman happening at M.I.T.B. End of the match Jey trying to kick Reigns and misses and hits Jimmy. Roman pins Jimmy just off the super kick to show how powerful Jey truly is in the BL. Then after the match Reigns makes Jimmy get on a knee or something and put the one up and then everyone hugs it out! Jimmy turning right now isn’t catastrophic enough…their stalling fellas. Think about it… BL reunites on SD after Romans title defense against Jimmy to an array of boos from the crowd and FINALLY the BL will have legitimate heel heat for the tease turns. THATS when we see the downward spiral throughout the fall and Jey turns on Roman FINALLY in WG in November. It’s PERFECT! Then we have a 5 month build for Jey Roman at 40
Gonna be hard to top the bloodline. I believe in Triple H.
Was that from the wire
Roman vs Jey at Wrestlemania with the gold is a money making match
0:17 jimmy’s face looks like he murdered someone
Maybe its the storyline . But just so everybody knows . It was roman who put the bloodline and Sami together . Sure the storyline portraits roman as the underdawg but roman is always the big dawg . Nor to forget we all love roman no matter what .its all his hardwork that paid tribute to the forgotten usos, sami and ko . Nobody loved when ko defeated john cena , nobody lives sami before the bloodline saga . Hats off to triple H .
Es impactante como cayó al piso y el resto se quedó atonito, un gran luchador
Well done Jimmy 👏👏👏 long time in coming, Jey should've taken a leaf out of his brother's book and done it along time ago...
So 🤔... This Is End Of Roman Reigns Wwe Title Steak The Usos Will Not Help Him Every Match Cause Already Betrayed
The real tribal chief we acknowledge jimmy uso
I love that part were jimmys like I got too!!! And than that second superkick 😂 that was supposed to be jey but he wasnt ready to leave yet but its gonna be so satisfying when he does
aye man.. stuff like that needed to happen man..love this storyline but ot was getting boring
Roman thought shi was sweet😂
I love professional wrestling so much.
I swear I've watched this like 10 times
As a brother I feel him 💯 percent when a brother says he got u...He got u
Jimmy  snapped
😮😮😮
This is the BEST storyline I've ever seen!
😢😢😢
Jimmy had the same expression after kicking Roman that Dean Ambrose had when the Shield reunited - pure adrenaline!
I loved every second of this moment.
Super bloodline na finish pannirunga
Ab friday ko usos ki kher nhi
That scream after the 2nd kick, so good. Like a weight lifted off his shoulders. We've all been there.
I never been so excited for Smackdown.
Non credevo fosse possibile godere con un video di wrestling... Eppure eccoci qui! Finalmente! Dagliene pure un altro!
Undoubtedly the greatest moment in jimmy usos career
통쾌하다.
I am one of those attitude era lovers, but got to say The Bloodline story has been brilliant, fans love it too. Would like to see Sami take the strap, would be awesome
Are you not done telling the bloodline story. I want something new
Why Jimmy why You son of a B Tell me why 😭
That must have felt good Jimmy.😂😂😂😂😂😂
USO kick brok on his head so Roman angryed
"professional" wrestling fans cherishing a predeterimined "sport" have to be the saddest most pathetic fanbase of all
"professional" wrestling fans cherishing a predeterimined "sport" have to be the saddest most pathetic fanbase of all
Yes 🥲🥲
Triple H best for business <3
When he said I got you and kicked him then the scream Jimmy is turning into a savage
Good job
Ive always liked Roman as well as Usos and Solo but this was necessary…its how you continue the storyline.
I have watched this clip multiple time ...awesome
People always thought either jimmy or solo would betray Roman..but it always about Jey
YESSSSS!!!! THE MOMENT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR. The cringe is over
I swear Jey was about to break character again 😂
Very soon 100milliom subscriber family❤
good jay
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Don't get mad at me but what Jimmy did was kind of the right thing he did
🎵  Jimmy kicked Roman and i don’t care Jimmy kicked Roman and I don’t caaaaarrrrre🎵🎵
Both are roman reigns copy cats.
That last kick was cool 😂😂😂
Who's excited for Smackdown tonight?!
It's always the quiet ones, the bullied ones....when we finally get tired of being bullied and pushed and finally snap.  This is what we seeing right now.  That man has snapped....he is the one everyone should have been worrying about.
Roman deserved that, because he misbehaviour to uce, good work by Jimmy 👍👍
Come on ous 😂😂😂 that is a most beautiful super kicks I ever seen in my hole life😍
This Saturday Will be interesting 🎉
😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
Wooow Jimmy bravo 👏
Now roman is losing trust😢😂
Best bloodline
Super
Honestly Jimmy's kick is not enough, they should make Jey & Jimmy both superkick on Tribal Cheat's face. I really can't wait this happen anymore longer
😡😡😡
The thumbnail is basically a hair and sneaker commercial in one.
"I got you!!!!!!"😢
Roman is nothing without jemy and jey
Unbelievable jeff
When we said "just give us a story to get behind and we'll support Roman" WWE went really really far above and beyond. This might be the best story in pro wrestling history.
Executive it perfectly. .😮
Roman renz namber 1.
😂😂😂op
shame on you ooso
Jimmys all alone maybe she would team to samizayn
My fav is jey. But Jimmy did the right thing
Yess good👍👍👍👍🤟👑jimmi
Good punishment
Finally bloodline ends as they come to their senses... I hope the fiend ends the Reigns of roman💟😂
How the jey was looking when jimmy kicked Roman. Jey also wants to do that😂❤
Super boss
Se lo merecia por mamón
3 long years. “It’s over”
I’m doing what you should’ve done a long time ago. Hits hard 😢
Roman Reigns deserve at super Kick 👽
Should of been Jey taking that shot!! Lol
RIP Bloodline
Bkl chutiya WWE bc
Roman Deserved that
EnD Of an Historic Era 💔
Roman reigns deserved all the punishment he could get including getting superkicked I may not like the usos but I respect what jimmy did to roman
Roman by himself
Roman deserved it
Serves right to roman and he was toying usos from star 😂
Thank you uso
If Roman gets hit by a car on Smackdown soon… we know who did it😅
Someone must've given the WWE a crash course on subtle story telling cause they've nailed it this whole bloodline fued. Jimmy calling his brother by his real name in hell in a cell, the dialogue without microphones, and wow the body language. When Jimmy kicks Roman you can cover Jey's face and tell he is shocked and scared of what Roman is gonna do... 10/10 just incredible
I will say poor Roman he can't stop being betrayed by people 😢😂
Even as it's coming to an end, the Bloodline storyline still continues to be the best storyline in wrestling today, and one of the greatest in history.
Very good
Jimmy will face the worst.
Roman chapter is finished
Porque tuvo que terminar así, y ahora escucharé la música like crazy de Jimin 😅
When bro said " I'm doing what YOU should've done a long time ago " on God I felt that
O gaha
One of my favorite wwe shows of all time was awesome. I've been watching wresting ever since I was 7 yrs old. Im 54 years old now.
Wow 👌👌👍👍
I was waiting for this moment 😂
Interesting.   Who's goes where.   And new tag teams.  And who becomes BUDDY'S
AMAZING, I was waiting for this moment a long time Jimmy 😏👏👏👏
Bloodline story masterpiece 🔥🔥
I love the bloodline and boy this got me out of my seat fucken awesome bring back the day ones baby
He deserved it I don’t like how Roman be treating Uce 🤣
I love how Paul Heyman was like why 😂 and this was better than Sami hitting Roman with the chair.
Paul Heyman love em or not he pitch the whole bloodline story to begin with and look at it now he made WWE watchable just because of this
🕺💃💃💃yaaay am so happy
Jimmy uso thank you for kicking Roman reigns I've been waiting for you to do that for a long time I love you you all you you always be the greatest tag team it to ever lives in great performance I just hope one day I can meet you and please be safe ❤
Jimmy was feeling ucey
Thank you Jimmy
As Soon As I Saw This I Said GOODBYE BLOODLINE!!
Its the primal scream at 0:57 that gets me EVERYTIME. You could feel how badly Jimmy needed to release that anger
It’s the “I got u” for me✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
I love the screen at the end that was motions and energy built up
Only reason why Jimmy super kicked Roman is because you all forgot Vince has a reputation of breaking up tag teams and factions thanks Vince for ruining another great storyline
Almost feels like Rikishi moment, "I did it for The Rock", Jimmy snapped and took hold of the moment and his anger he's been keeping for many months finally released.  Owens and Zayn was correct, the Usos are leaving the Bloodline, leaving Roman with Heyman and Solo.
Man, the scream from Jimmy on that second superkick you can feel it. For the first time in years he feels free, liberated.
Jimmy did the right thing jey should have done it a long time ago plus I get Roman has gotten stabbed in the back but he really deserves this one if he wasn’t for the usos especially jey he wouldn’t reach a thousand days as champion
That's why you dont disrespect family the amount of help Roman got from the Usos to retain his titles and then to treat Jey like that as a brother I would've done the same thing
I loved jimmy’s “I got you!” Followed by the kick. And after Jimmy taking Jey away while saying “we got to go. We got to go”. He knows what he did. He knows what it means. And he is fully prepared.
قلبى يقفز من السعادة وانا اشاهد هذه العصابة تنهار
About time
The way this story has played out any one of them Solo,Jimmy or Jey could have and would have good reason to turn on Roman.
:)
Is Paul face after the 2nd kick that has me dyin hahaha
Jimmy screwing Roman here is the equivalent of him winning a championship I feel like. So much emotion and passion!
The Samoans have created pro-wrestling magic! Most over segment across the shows, matched only by Rollins-Styles programming together.
I waited a long time for one of the usos to stand up for them self’s to the tribal chief. It’s ok guys remember family fights sometimes you need to give a boot to the face of your cousin when he steps out of line he said we ain’t day ones no more lol get that boot to the face who do you think you are talking to family like that lol.
That could have been a WrestleMania moment. ❤
تحي  جمي وجاي❤❤❤❤❤
Say what you want but Face push=superkick He deserved it
Roman Reigns: There ain't no Day 1 no more you understand me!?  Jimmy kicks Roman Jey: Why would you do that.  Like Roman didn't put his hands in your face twice🤣🤣🤣
Best WWE storyline in the past ten years. Sick AF. Took a tribe pun intended but they all did their part.
Jey screaming "Joe"! to Roman was absolutely awesome
The yell from Jimmy at the end I felt that
Good or bad, Jimmy only did these things for the sake of his brother. Best story telling I've seen in ages
It's been 3 days and I've already watched this clip a dozen times, this was magical ❤️🔥
I expected Jey to do this before Jimmy. Looks like Sammi too his balls. Jey is not Main Event Jey anymore. Falling in line was in Jimmy's book.
That superkick felt soo good and I didn’t even kick him
Finalmente. Jimmy ha capito che Roman gli usava e li disprezzava. Si è sbloccato. Ora si deve sbloccare Jey e Solo
Jimmy aveva le palle strapiene e dopo l'ennesimo gesto dii disprezzo di Roman lui si è sbloccato 👍👍
Telling another grown man I whooped you then I’ll whoop you now is crazy… they should have fought then and there
all fake and stage wrestling is fake
I bet Roman was having flashbacks to Seth standing over him with a chair
This made The Night Of Champions worth watching the whole night. I told my girlfriend that it was going to happen tonight and she didn't believe me at all.  She couldn't believe what had happened, she was like how did you know it was going to happen. Finally the Uso's can put that idiot Romain and now maybe the Uso's and Owns and Zayne can be there own Stable.
This is awesome!
Roman did a great help with Sami Zayn.  He resurrected a burned beal and brought it to tack time  belt of Smekdan and Raw
Thrash
Jimmy is a perfect big brother. He took the same abuse Jey took but when Jey took it Jimmy said oh hell nall...family or not nobody messes with my lil bro😂😂😂😂😂
Best promo in WWE history. Everybody was on the edge of their seats!😊
How far roman has come man 🥺goated storyline
Way to go Jimmy USO  Showing Roman you're not scared of him 💯%👏🏼👍🏻
The way Roman knocked out of the ring with Jimmy's Superkick was hilarious 😂
What if this was a Chair shot on Roman's back.....??? What if Jey Uso will do that...??
As always WWE never disappoints!
💥💥💥💥
Now wwe is talking..now there is something in bloodline..hubris
i think jey or solo will do that jimmy did that storyline is great.
As an elder brother he should respect his brothers but he didn't so he deserves it
I really enjoyed that. Well done Jimmy uso😊
Fall of Roman Reigns started
The best thing about this is we’ve still got 2 more potential moments like this! The double superkick from the Usos and the Samoan spike from solo! And after that we need Roman to lose his mind, beat them all half to death until we hear “if you smellllllll…..”
Jimmy face vs Roman heel at money in the bank! Then I’m guessing usos vs Roman and solo at summerslam
"Why'd you do that!?" Roman was roughing up Jimmy's brother.  Me against my brother, my brother and I against our cousin, my cousin and I against the stranger.
Im not sure if im the only one who feels this, but i reckon Jey will turn on Jimmy next. Roman will somehow manipulate Jey and turn him against Jimmy. We'll see im hoping that wont happen but got that feeling.
Michael Cole🔥😎
I can't stop watching this, Roman Reigns poked  the bear too many times and the bear finally snapped!
Brothers Betrayal 😢
I guess cody was right in a way at least
Perfection at its Finest....LOL
I got you.
Super
About 20th time i have watched this and that second kick goes down is the most satisfying kick ever. Up there with drew in royal rumble 2020 to brock
The moment i saw that happening i got rears in my eyes and said " It's so beautiful"
Turn the playback speed down. You're welcome.
not fair They got to see this out of America live but the states had to watch on ppv!
I Acknowledge My Tribal Chief JIMMY USO 💯💪🏽
Face turn Jimmy Uso
Roman deserves it,i just hate how Roman treats the bloodline and I think it's coming to an end.good job jimmy✌
That second super kick was crazy 💀
It’s about time the whole reigns bloodline thing is boring I stopped watching them months ago
It sounds like Jimmy was in pain
Thank you jimmy ❤
I just watched the whole almost two hour video of the entire bloodline story just to come back to this and watch it repeatedly! This without a shadow of a doubt is the greatest storyline wrestling has ever done! It all makes sense, and it all comes around full circle! Roman Reigns has always been an abuser, and he beat Jey Uso into submission and treats him like a dog. Jimmy Uso only joined to protect Jey, and now he has finally had enough of seeing both his brother, and his family be abused by this power-hungry dictator. This is a beautiful moment and I could really write a whole essay on it. It will be watched and studied for many years I am sure! Better than anything Shakespeare ever put out.
اخيرا دا اللي بيكتب السناريوهات عقل الحمد لله
this is good thing about usos🔥🔥🔥
F**king love it!!
The way yelled at the end clearly was tired of roman
Now its Jey's turn!!
Why do I have to drag one of these men into chaos as of late. 🤦‍♂
😂 night 💤 night 😂
It's a over time
Roman has to see this coming , well not from Jimmy but JEY  but geez a loo who knew Jimmy turn on Roman,  I always thought Jimmy very loyal to Roman but Roman Empire finally crumble... I'm guessing the Uso not taking Roman B S no more, enough is enough... bullying your own family members far too often can put you in a compromised  position or in a dangerous territory... so as everyone can see .. Roman got what he deserved ... getting too greedy with all the titles he can have, leave no room for the  Uso, this lead up to the ultimate  betrayal...n good for the Uso for finally break through the Roman reigns  wall... n congratulations  to Sammi n Kevin for retaining their undisputed tag team championship....and so a new chapter begin a huge feud starting with the Uso, Roman,  n solo..all family feud begin....it will be epic...stay tuned folks...as Kevin Owen n Sammie prediction  was right that the tribal chief family will fall apart....n  Roman family desserted him...in night of champions....sum up Roman dismay...of the betrayal by the Uso..?well done story scripted line, one of the greatest betrayal in history of WWE ...
My favorite part is when hes like "I GOTCHU!" And then proceeds to look like he instantly regrets it but also looks like he just released a lot of stress at the same time. I can't wait til Friday.
Don't worry Jimmy is just not feeling very ucey.
USO fan for life them bros are the ish!
So glad the ousos hv stood up to R. They don't need him. They r gr8 at what they do .
0:09 0:52 That pop man amazing❤
Clone wars 😆
God…this entire Bloodline saga…  It truly has been the greatest storyline WWE’s produced in years. This had been coming for a long time, and the execution was just flawless!  I cannot wait for SmarkDown.
Now that's Ucey
People change
love it
This was such an incredible moment. I didn’t think anything would top Sami betraying Roman, but this completely proved me wrong. Like always, the crowd was absolutely incredible. Imagine this happening during the pandemic times.
This was cheesy AF
Should have been done age's ago
My heart broke for Jimmy when he let out that pent up scream of pain and agony, this storyline is literally a masterpiece. WOW
Only way it would’ve been more epic if Paul Heyman caught one to the face RIGHT AFTER Roman!!!
Either being a part of it or the builder, he's always the one to get betrayed 😔
I got so excited when this happened
الواسو التوأم ، مع بعض اقوياء ، لايحتاجون رومن رينز..
It's shield all over again
Now thief Chief Roman he identified himself as an illegal player
I liked it very much
Pure catharsis. Perfection
That was awesome the usos are better on their own
Adrenaline came out of my nose
Wow this is #14 trending on youtube really shows how much people actually care for wrestling ( I think Jimmy was the one to break it up but jey is the one that is going to end it but dont forget solo....🤫
ITS ABOUT DAMN MF TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jimmy said don’t touch my brother 😂😂😂💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
0:09 I love it ❤❤❤❤❤❤
It was just a matter of time The Bloodline are no more.
Finally ,this neded too come too an end it was becoming so boreing😊
I hope this happens to the judgement day when dominik turn on Finn Balor and get mysterios family back together because a lot of dominik fans hate him that’s why the judgement day used him to turn against his father but for me it’s better that Rey mysterio and Dominik mysterio back together
I feel like Jey should’ve sold it more. Really bug out
Super Jimmy  your my favorite
Why jummy uso attack roman
And next time roman rengs loos the wwe champion
It's because of Jimmy and his bro..Roman survived the longest holding the belt
The Best betrays of wwe
This could get layers now because Jey stuck with the Bloodline for Jimmy and now Jimmy's turned so everything Jey threw away is for nothing. They could go a lot of ways with this. For example, Usos vs Roman and Solo but then Jey turns on both. Resentful of his brother for making his sacrifices worthless. Or keep them together.
Good Jimmy
"So gay" - Randy Orton 😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂
Roman deserve it.
Now it's time for shield please wwe will on high level when Dean will back😢
Even though they are twins And until this day I still can't tell them apart and they sound just alike 😂😂😂
Not jey saying the government 😂.
Yesss finally 😂👍
OMG
Sarà purè il migliore ma nn si può essere schiavi per sempre!!! Bravo Jimmy HAI fatto bene
we missed the shield
Who’s in support of what jimmy did to Roman kiss my comments
Roman is doing too much 😅😅to his younger brother I like what jimmy did to him
The way Roman fell out the ring as the crowd roared was brilliant.
I've been waiting for this moment ever since Roman started using his cousins to win.
Jimmy released all his anger now 👍🏻
I don't blame Jimmy One bit He was tired of Roman Reigns Abuse
Jimmy to Jey, I'm doing what you should have done a long time ago- man that was epic.
When is Roman said “ you are no day one no more” at that moment I knew a super kick was coming
Served him well he deserve it
,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👊👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👊👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👊👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👊👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👊👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👊👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👊👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👊👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
☝️☝️☝️ 😂😂😂😂😂😂
He had it coming. He only has himself to blame. Oh I love it. LMAO.
Sometimes you gotta kick your cousin in the face it happens 😅
This JUST MIGHT BRING BACK THE ROCK since they are all FAMILY
I still come her to watch this
Now frustration is blasted ! Game on 💥💥💥💥💥
"I'm doing what you should've done a long time ago" and the long time ago was 2020! Outstanding!!!
I like it 😅
And best academy award goes to paul heyman for his Best acting🤣🤣🤣🤣
End of bloodline
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The reason Jey never hit Roman is because of the deal they made back in 2020 at HIAC. If Jey said “I quit” he would fall in line. Roman choked Jimmy out and forced Jey to quit. With Jimmy he never wanted to be in The Bloodline and only stayed for Jey. Now that Jimmy super kicked Roman puts Jey in a tough position. Either side with Jimmy or stay with Roman.
That moment Jimmy powers up gives me the chills!
All the best jimmyy fire
The second kick was a 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Listen to your brother Jey
Roman and seth damn sucks
Let see now Roman Reigns destroy usos badly
He did the right thing 💯💯
☝️☝️
Roman really deserve that for messing around with his cousin
Its so satisfying to see roman gets superkick from jimmy😂
"there ain't no day one no more now get out of my ring!" *Kick
Much love to Jimmy Uso for stepping up to Roman Reigns I like when he told Jey that "I'm your brother I'd never treat you like this" that's brotherly love right there they deserve better!❤
This was such a beautiful thing to watch happen.  That 2nd kick was pure orgasmic. The funny part was the look on Paul Heyman's face.
Bloodline for the HOF
I've said it before and I'll say it again, Bloodline's history is one of the best in WWE history. Everyone's evolution is phenomenal, Sami from comic relief to big star, Jey started doubting and ended being Sami's loyal friend, to Uso loyal to Roman no matter what, Roman from representative tribal chief to arrogant, manipulative and disrespectful, Jimmy went from friend to foe of Zayn , loyal and now the end of the Bloodline. Everyone gave an incredible
End of bloodline
At both superkicks i was like BAAAAAAAAAAAAANG
wtf did he do
Wow, how do you guy's watch this stuff???
I told yal Usos gonna turn on Roman and cause Roman and solo to lose to Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens y'all didn't believe me
Roman is always Betrayed by His Loved Ones 🥺🫀
The bloodline is screwed I'll tell ya that
This is what we were waiting for......cracks in the bloodline
Jay uso and jimi best
And, Jay smiled again and tried his best conceal it.😂
Boom headshot 🙈
"Satisfying Moment"
This Reminds Me Alex Riley
I am very sad 😩😩😫😫😫😩😩😫
Guys i think their fight each other is fake in order to take the tagteam titles from sami and ko like when heyman and roman reigns did to brock lesnar 1 year ago.
ROMAN DESERVES THAT HE USE TO DISRESPECT JIMMY ABD JAY USOS💔
this BETRAYAL greatest more than samy zayn and seth rollins betrayals, the emotions, the anger, everything done perfectly. it's absolutly going to be the BIGGEST BETRAYAL in this DECADE
Hell yeahhhh
He Deserve it ☝️
0:50  " i got you" - i felt that
Highlight of the year
I can't believe that this would happen, I knew it already that jimmy had enough
Jimmy did what we expected! Well done
That's why we used to see scripted WWE, scripting at it's best 😅😂❤❤❤
Jey usos janata h ki ab Jimmy ka bachna mushkil h isliye to Jimmy ko rok rha tha ab SmackDown mea kya hoga intersting
Heyman knows his place 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
Its right time to breakup
Fake show fake scripts fake mves all is fake but no-one believe
wow very good
Soon Jey will turn on jimmy & at wrestlemania they both face eachother
2.8 mil in 2 days that says a lot
Wow😲
Lol i knew they were gonna eventually have ot go theyre own way
If it was jey who did this bro would probably break character again lmao
So true. Jimmy saw that Jey was the "Right hand man" & should have pulled the trigger long ago. They always had each other's backs & now it's going to be interesting to see now that Sami is right how they react to him
You know what? You completely f'ing lost me at the end of WrestleMania.... and now, you may have gotten me back. Bravo.
GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LOL @ Jey's initial reaction to the look on Jimmy's face after the first kick at 0:17 😲  He nearly broke character AGAIN!! You know it's a great storyline when the characters are enjoying it too😂
Look, I know this is all pre-planned, but DAMN, the look on Jay's face after that 2nd (took long enough to build that one up, FP Jr!) Super kick... P-R-I-C-E-L-E-S-S!!!!🤣🤣🤣💩💀☠️
This is going to pump up smackdown
One of the best storylines wwe has done. Long time coming.
Yhhhhhhhhhh jimmy losing this feud soooooooo lets go solo
Am so Happy too see Dog condition 😂😂
The DOG was treated as a street DOG. Cool
We are looking for solo didn't expected that
Cú đá vào mặt roman có cảm giác tuyệt vời
Please Don't show Roman as over powered wrestler Many wrestlers should have chance to be wwe champion Like Braun strowman(The world war Hulk) and please turn John Cena into heel character because before retirement he should Become Wwe world Champion to break ric flair record so please do ladder match for WWE universal hand world heavy weight champion ship.
Uso Bro's🔥
Jimmy is quick to anger, Jey is obviously holding in pain and won’t release it.
Dang, ive been gone too long. Product went to trash about 5 solid years ago. Guess ive been missing out as of late. Brock is a face now, and this is what has happened to thufferin thuckatach?
Roman said do something so jimmy did something
Jimmy had to do what Jey can't do! He realizes the truth of all the facts that Kevin and Sami told to him and he just wanted to protect Jey. Jimmy literally had enough of it. "That's it I'm done with this Uce! I have to do what was not done a long time ago" and the Superkick says it, that's the last time Roman will lay his hands on Jey. Jimmy loved his brother and what they did to Solo was an accident. They're brothers! Jimmy is the new boss and the real "Tribal Chief". That is Jimmy's ring now! Jimmy still shocked at first but the scream says, "Well deserve!".
Without usos in his corner Roman won’t be able to hold onto the title as long as he did because most matches was due to the usos saving Roman from losing
Ooh, cant wait to get there. Wish i didnt see that spoiler because i am not caught up.  I love the emotional pageantry of this show and how it clicks into american culture and basic human values.
That 2nd kick was everything in the making followed by the scream. Jimmy nailed it. Those raw emotions made that moment even bigger especially how he pushed Jey out of the way the 2nd time yelling “I got you”.  That’s 2 opportunities Jey missed out and looked confused.
When all this happened, Jimmy deliberately super kicked Reigns, i was like, what just happened & there was fire inside rising in me. Jay seemed confused, not sure if it happened right but Jimmy was for sure had it all & again super kicked Reigns, with the saying to Jay that what he should've done long time ago, he has just done that. Jimmy said right. All the time, it was Jay who would get insult, showing down by Roman & even i had thought that Jay will revolt but it was Jimmy whi did this all. Now we've to see, when Solo turn against Reigns.
Jimmy is right
Can’t wait till Smack Down This Friday
It's great to see Jimmy release his emotions out. It was a long time coming 👏
Would have been better if they both beat the brakes off of Roman
This is what it's all about!! This is Pro Wrestling!
The roles reversed now. Long time ago, Jey done it. Now, it's Jimmy's turn.
Fast x in theaters now playing
Jimmy why do tha Roman is king of wwe and your brother lot of love from Nepal 🇳🇵 wwe family 👪
Jimmy 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
People knew Jimmy and jey because of Roman,he has given them spotlight..this is how they repay by kicking on the face,time for Roman to be baddest heel❤
"Jimmy, what did you do?" OMG Corey Graves...shut up!!🙄 Watching The Tribal Cheat getting superkicked...I can watch it over & over...😊
I would roman deserves that just to be superKicked   cause Jimmy knows what’s right for his   twin brother and to what Roman did to JeY very long time ago and Jimmy wants to do the same thing as Roman treated JeY that’s why Jimmy wants to do that
Jimmy opened that can of Austin. 3:16
Awesome love Jimmy can't stand Roman can't wait to see it play out
The greatest storyline in WWE history
The arena , the people wanted it " one more time" they get it!!
Traitor
WHOOO CAREESSSS
It’s about dam time
Jimmy express his emotion and rage after being humiliated was delightful to watch.
This isssss mindblowingggggggg🤯🤯🤯🤯 oh man! I can't describe...... Loving every single bit of it maann.... Got goosebumps
Good Job Jimmy Bro... Well Bro...
Wrestling storytelling at it’s very best …… loved it!
Give this trio an oscar  or something
His title reign and undefeated streak are numbered. Jimmy seeking revenge on what he did to him is just epic. Jey still doing the same gestures when Sami smashed the chair to Roman in the Rumble.🤣
Just normal stuff in WWF!
Jimmy got that Dog in HIM!!!!!!!
Superfly would be proud
It was bound to happen. Years of bullying and torture by Roman. Glad Roman is getting his butt handed to him lol everyone knew the script was heading this way. Only way it stays fresh.
The Bloodline is coming to an end
I've watched this over a hundred times already.  The super kick we have all been waiting for
I feel very happy..... We want old roman reigns
Jimmy simply had enough of doing Roman's dirty work. I don't feel will go away quietly though. Just when you think this civil war is over it keeps adding on many different stories.
They're family ...  But y'all know all fake
I KNEW IT‼️ ITS JIMMY TIME💪🏾 I MEAN IT‼️ HAVE JIMMY DO IT🤙🏾
The bloodline story is one of the greatest story telling ever. Roman reigns got superkicked by Jimmy. Jimmy done all of that for his brother Jay. Brilliant stroyline. I think in summerslam jey uso will challenge roman reigns 🤙💫🔥.
Jimmy been my daeg,kets go jey!!!!
Jimmy did what he should of a long time ago Im glad he did
About time
The moment jimmy super kicked  roman made me do the old finger snap more than 5 times......long time coming and roman deserved it........soo EPIC
Jimmy's face says it all. He's had enough. That scream at the end to top it all up.
Best story  in modern era
He reminded Roman that when it comes to my brother. I am his damn keeper!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Salute to Jimmy Uso 🫡☝🏽
Yaaaaaa way to go jimmy 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉.   You just gain my respect 🫡
He should of been like “You gotta be better than that! You gotta do it like this” *proceeds to super kick Roman even harder*
why jay always conflicted tho he needs to make a decision and be ok with it lol
woooooo❤
Roman ringhs and cristiano Ronaldo in sudia arabi 😂😂
Watch it be like a A Train situation where Jey surprisingly is the one to stay with Roman despite getting treated the harshest.
Wow
Loved it every week more please
☝️☝️ The Bloodline ☝️☝️
Oops!!
Jimmy good job brother.
Nice kick
I'm STILL in shock!! I havent seen an event like this since Macho Man and Hulk Hogan fought in the hospital 😳😳😳😳😳
Moment of the year
Was SO overdue already but glad it finally happened. The repercussions are gonna be interesting to see this week.
Joder, es Cine!!🚬🚬🚬🚬
It's about time 😊
Cody: A chief without a tribe. Jey is gonna leave you (Jimmy is the first to turn on him) .  Sami to Jey: You choose to take Roman Reigns' abuse every single week. Roman has been manipulating you for not just weeks, not just months but years. Sami to Jimmy: You don't have to go down with the ship. You and Jey deserve better. Kevin: I'm looking at the hearts of the Bloodline. What would the Bloodline be without the Usos. If they can't see that Roman's  just using them to stay where he's at they deserve everything that is gonna happen to them.  Roman: ACKNOWLEDGE ME!!! I'm the greatest of all time. Me: Dude if it wasn't for the Uso's your reign would have ended a long time ago.
My jaw dropped once I saw roman getting dropped by Jimmy uso the bloodline is officially over it won't be long until roman is no longer champion
Love them or hate them, but they were the only reason for the change in Sami Zayn's character, from a jobber and booed guy to the loved champion!
Prediction: This Friday, Roman asks Jey to look for Jimmy but Jey fails to look for him. Then Roman abuses Jey then Jimmy comes out and challenges Roman at Money in the Bank. And at, Money in the Bank, Jey turns on Jimmy and shockingly sites with Roman causing Jimmy to lose the match. Then Cody beats Brock at Money in the Bank, giving him enough redemption to challenge Roman at Summerslam. At Summerslam, Jey turns on Roman, then Jey and Jimmy distract Roman allowing Cody to hit 3 Cross Rhodes on Roman, then Cody finally finishes his story.
Finally standing up for himself
Second superkick........greatest
I will never forget Roman putting Jimmy in the guillotine to make Jey say i quit... I've been waiting for this day for ages... TY JIMMY
Ty Jimmy...
Jimmy's guttural yell at the end sold me ,
They did Jey vs Reigns for the title already. Let’s do Jimmy vs Reigns at Money in the Bank
Cinema.
Yes finally they betray Roman i hate Roman
Am I the only 1 who watched this a 1000 times & still wanna keep watching lol jimmy & jey the ones roman & solo the twos. ☝️
I see one of the usos takeing them belts off roman Sence the rock can’t
Tribal cheif getting too big for them boots
About time man 😂😂😂
I’ve watched this like 35 times now lol. I love it
It is fake lol
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes bout damn time
Man, the way most of y’all are hyping this up, it seemed like I missed a huge storyline! I fell off of Wwe years ago, but have been subscribed for years despite falling off from them and just would watch clips and highlights whenever I got a chance or whenever they uploaded. Kinda wanna see this from the start.
The best thing is this was the same event that jey uso went against Roman for the title and 3 years later it’s not much different
I gotchu.  Jimmy Uso 2023
Love how he made sure that legit connected
0:09   0:52
Jey’s face at the end 😂
Finally, Jimmy did the right thing, he put Roman in his place with his super kick to end the bloodline with two kicks, one from Jimmy and the other was for Jey to kick him too, but Jimmy did it for him.
I don't wanna see any of you stupid bloodline fanboys crying and dying in the comment section you understand me😂🤣🤣😂
Give Paul some kicks too
Jimmy wait that time too long now.... He doing what Roman deserves
A four way fight for the title would be a good way to end
That has to be one of the best storylines in a long time
WWE have created one of the best storyline of the modern era with the bloodline. I like it how it has not been rushed but been built up and there's plenty of other family members that could yet be involved. Brilliant TV viewing.
beautufull.!!
U undaStind me ?
Wwe creative team is messing up the product! It would have been more shocking to see Sammy betraying KO! Here's why, Kevin Owens and Sammy Zane are on different lvls and I get it thry trying to spike up the product! But Sammy joining back the bloodline and having his own beef with KO would be a much better storyline. Roman never came to Sammy for help so why Sammy's betrayal to the tribal cheef hasn't picked up steam!? Because it was bad business, who would you pair with Owens perhaps a ridle but Sammy blends well with the bloodline and ever since he left the bloodline he's been a solo act that will fade very quickly putting wwe ratings in gepordy. Don't know how, but they should pair them back together soon before wwe in itself falls on its face , wwe don't have anyone like Roman
Make sure we give credit to Roman & Heyman for this brilliant storyline as they are getting ready to start the bloodline civil war I bet some of you are so simple minded y’all don’t realize Roman pushing the Usos & Solo to they’re max potential before he leaves for Hollywood solo will be the next solo but he’s taking Roman spot when Roman leaves for Hollywood
Hell yeah 🍻
Childish
One of the best storylines in WWE history. Hell ..one of the best storylines in wrestling history.
The push to Jey was Jimmy pulling the trigger for him .
Not too often I get played like a violin. Well played. Whoever is behind this storyline deserves to be the first writer in The HOF.
It wasn't the kicks. It was the screams after😤😡🤬🗣
Jimmy's way of telling Roman, AKNOWLEDGE ME!!!
This. Is. AWESOME!
Funny thing is, it was Jey who told a story with his face. Jimmy was the quiet soldier who took it. And he finally exploded
Go back to the very beginning, the way Jimmy and Jey were practically forced into the Bloodline after Jey and Roman's final match. Look at Jimmy in that. Look at him now. Everything Jey did, everything that brought him into the bloodline, it wasn't loyalty to Roman, it was loyalty to Jimmy. And now, Jimmy knows that he has to return that loyalty, come what may.   That "I GOT YOU" is pure catharsis for Jimmy, as much as the screaming afterward is. No more gaslighting. No more bullying. No more manipulation. Jimmy knows that at this point, they have to free themselves, and he's willing to burn it all down to do it.   Roman's most powerful weapon was the fear of him as a deity-like being, that Greatness On a Different level. Jimmy looked him in the eye, kicked him in the face, and said 'I'm not afraid of you anymore."
"The Bloodline saga" will be remembered as one of the best storytelling in wrestling history
It was long time coming🤣
I have a feeling solo will turn against him
the bloodline will be missed 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Finally the bomb explodes
I love it it makes me laugh
Roman really needs to stop turning his back to people 😂
0:07
Can I just say that Heyman was in the background with golden expressions
Dammit WWE This could be the BIGGEST story in wrestling HISTORY! MY GOD THE MONEY YOU'LL MAKE! He'll, I'm getting YouTube TV again just to see where this goes! A GD GOLDMINE!
The only way to keep these 2 in line now is to show Roman’s dominance by putting the world heavyweight championship around his waist.
I felt Jimmy's WAR CRY in my soul!!! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING STORYLINE!!!
Oh My God the story begins now
That second super kick after the 'i got you' best storyline in years, shame wwe have wasted so many storylines over the years
“IM DOING… WHAT YOU SHOULDVE DONE…. A LONG TIME AGO. I GOTCHCU”
That was really satisfying
Jimmy is tribal Chief 😂🎉🎉 day 1
What A Short Woow Jimmy❤❤❤❤
Jimmy And Jay❤❤❤❤❤
It’s time for Roman to call up xyon quinn from NXT to join the bloodline
Jimmmy❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The adrenaline rush was crazy when I first saw it this is the type of energy wrestling fans live for 💯
Wooww Superb Jimmy❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jey carried them in 2019 now it's Jimmy favour back pure excellence
The look on jey face says a million things gwaan Jimmy🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Best storyline in wrestling PERIOD
❤
Everyone is very happy for Jimmy cause he satisfied himself But No one knows how much hard work need to be a Big Dog. It's oky Roman. That day isn't yours but Jimmy don't know what he just did.
Roman ന്റെ അണ്ണാക്കിൽ 😂😂😂👌
Will Jimmy's super kick at NOC go down as 'Super Kick Heard Around The World'?🤔
i really cant describe what i felt in that moment. I really dont know how many times I saw that.
Jimmy NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE
Best  quote of thi year. "I'm doing wat yu should of done a long time ago! I GOT YU!!!   (Enter Superkick to roman here)""
قشعريرة
Roman deserved every single piece of that too
Don't y'all be shocked if jey stands by roman and turns on Jimmy.... And it might just happen at the next ppv... It's gonna build up later like it's a feud between roman and solo vs jimmy and jey. Then just when u think the Usos are gonna get the victory, jey gonna pull a Harlem heat moment and turn on his brother... Then u will see brother vs brother at a huge ppv, and that's when the rock will eventually step in to settle the family feud.... That's just my prediction....
Isn't This Kind Of Iconic 2 years ago Jey USO superkick Roman Reigns in the face when Jimmy USO returned Now 2 years later NOC Jimmy Does It And Now Next It's A Matter Of Time Till Solo Does It Too Also This Was The Same Event We're Jey USO vs Roman Reigns Took Place How Iconic Do You Think This Is 😊
My respect for Jimmy Uso📈⬆️⬆️⬆️
I knew this day was coming
WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT Jimmy USO  Super Kicked  Roman At  WWE Night of Champions
I'm so glad this happened. I'm very proud of the Usos. Nothing against Roman but it's time for them to be family again not a chief & his servants.
bloodline finally imploded I'm sure it wont happen but I would absolutely love to see the old roman reigns
I wanna see dom betraying rhea
Ugh new problem with bloodline 😩 😭
Nice happened😂
I liked it when Jimmy Uso widened his eyes after he kicked Roman, because it makes it look like it was his biggest risk of his career.
Jimmy done what most ppl wanted to see great job Jimmy 👏 u got my respect again. Am sick of roman story its so dam boring.
Bruu jimmy just snapped 😳 👏
Jimmy To Roman: "Welcome to the USO Penitentiary!!! it's Not Paranoia it's the USO!!!" 🤟🤟🤟
Roman had it coming
Roman deserve 😂
Phenomenal storytelling.. we are witnessing the end of The Bloodline. Hopefully one of the brothers, preferably Jey USO takes the belt off Roman
Man for the first time in years I feel so great again, the abuse was too much thank you Jimmy you should have done that a long time ago
OMG Yes !!!🎉🎉🎉😂 this is so great Suck it Roman 😂😂😂😂😂
Finally! 🙌😭               Now, just when we think it's over, watch they continue to milk the whole Bloodline thing for another year. 🙄💀
I am doing what you should have done. I got you uce🥶
WWE Hands down the best story in a long time and everyone in it plays their part very good.
YESSSSSSSS, YESSSSSSSS,,,,FINALLY  !!!
This was okay but it would've have been more better if it was happened before at WrestleMania 39 or at some unexpected time before
Bloodline is emotion no 1 storyline hats off to every single character of it Roman jey jimmy solo paul and sami they just killed it bloodline video brought views in millions and Bloodline always trend on social media platforms we the ones ☝️💯🔥😍❤
The amount of times I’ve rewatched this since it came out is unhealthy
Finally it done,, tnx usos❤
What was he thinking 😮😮😮😮😮😮
This is the best Saudi event in recent years. Thank you Triple H
Love this ❤
Main Event Jimmy....
0:09   0:52  The revenge super kicks 👊
YES!!!!!!!!!
Roman deserve this kick
Whoever created this storyline deserves an Oscars
He disrespect We The Ones and finally he got the rewards.
One of the best thing happened after ages!
I Love Roman and Attitude 🔥🤫😎... It's not sad that Jimmy kicked Roman, it's sad that Roman was so pissed off in those days. 😢
Omg finally
Did Jimmy do it for the Rock?
Oh.... 😂
Tribal Hog got Betrayed  💀😂
Reigns sells this perfectly
He surely deserved that kick 🦶 Well done Uce ❤
they are more hip hop blacks than samoans
Paul face bruh😂
I can see the whole Samoan family turns on Jimmy making him the black sheep at Roman 1000 championship reigns and Rock comes to set things straight
Same reaction shown by Jey when Sami hit Roman with a steel chair ...
👍
Glad to see Jimmy finally getting the big spotlight. He had get like an extra ever since the Main Event Jey Uso run. Kind of hope to see Roman vs Jimmy at MitB.
Nice story 🐱🤣
We all love Jimmy but soon he will acknowledge the Tribal Chief. It’s just getting started 😂☝🏾
هههههههههههههه رومان يستحق ذالك واكثر انه مغرور كبير
JIMMY NEVER FORGOT HOW HE CHOKED HIM OUT TO BEAT HIS BRO .
The best moment of all time I felt the anger, the adrenaline rush no matter how many times I see it I still feel every single time
This storyline deserves a box office movie with an Oscar award
Just like Cody said it would happen 😅
That is great from the USO, Roman thought its Solo who can do better. Without the USO there will be no Bloodline.
Best part of the night ❤
Jimmy vs Roman which one is right?
Do remember that Jimmy is the one who superkicked Sami back at the Royal Rumble as well!!!
❤❤❤very good roman attitude over
I speak for everyone on this ABOUT DAMN TIME!!!
I laughed so hard 🤣
0:56 FELT THAT IN MY SOUL
Amazing storyline ! Can’t to wait to see what’s next 🤙🏻🤙🏻
I like that fearless kick heaaa 😎😎 Jimmy is fearless gay I like that gay yheaa
Jimmy 😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖Wait for nxt roman step 🤝🏻
Finally like this i love... Kwkwkw
People hate Vince, but it was him who wrote this fantastic Bloodline saga.  All the memories like Sami joining and leaving, Roman's abuse of the Uso's and now this powerful moment.
Roman had a huge fan following but his attitude reduced his fan following
Seth × Jimmy 😂
This is old match
Love jimmy
I watched this 1000 times lets gooo somebody had to
Sami’s right all along
Good super l am happy ha ha
Correct jimmy you are really correct decision attack roman( 2023 year ), to bring back in year against 2020 year. So, finally broken BLOODLINE....2023 year
He got betrayed 4th time 💔
One of the greatest storyline of all time. From formation , to Sami's inclusion to Bloodline at their peak to Sami's betrayal to Jimmy's super kick,everything superbly executed . Honestly hope this storyline never ends but it looks like its about to end. It will be interesting how it ends?
Its satisfiying to watch this over and over again.
Finally 😍
I love this
Paul's face after
ohhh great now jeys gonna go missing again and is going to be forced to choose between jimmy or roman😂😂😂
Thank U jimmy
haha big dog,yu got it bro
This storyline just EXPLODED right in front of our eyes aye
I LOVE JIMMY
If Roman was in No DQ or an extreme match against anyone for the titles, one chair shot or anything to his jaw would finally make stay down and shut the F up
First royal rumble now night of champions
Jimmy superkicked Roman because he was on his way of becoming the Marty Jannety of the team.  Jimmy went to business for himself.  Jey Uso will have his own redemption arc, Jimmy just did not want to be the weaker link.
He deserved it
Yeahhhh Jimmy 👏👏👏👏👏👏See when you disrespect your cousins they will turn your back on you . We not going take no more Roman ✊✊✊✊
I love the final kick delivered by Jimmy usos🙆‍♂️.Roman regins deserve it.
Finally, thank you jimmy. Someone has to put him to gos place.
The screams he let out after the second kick sounded like they were bottled up inside him for so long.
Yeah not today Vin Diesel. Jimmy taking care of family problems.
Jimmy kicking Roman was the equivalent of him taking a bullet for his brother... Wow. 10/10.
“I was mad at Sami because he did what I always wanted to do from the beginning.”
That's phenomenal from Bloodline,all of them have made it like saga of emotions runs among family and friends. Ending was ice on cake
The bloodline story is a masterpiece of storytelling. Simply for it's ability to elevate forgotten stars like the Usos and SZ & KO
On ne trahit pas le sang jymmi
Storyline Gold Usos 🎉🎉🎉 Next stop RAW then Smackdown
“Hi waitress, yes can you please serve me another pot of hot tea because this is real good.” 😂
Já estava na hora do Ronan aprender uma lição
ABSOLUTELY, the best storyline I've ever seen!!
Im glad what JIMMY did. Roman deserve every BIT OF THEM KICKS!!!!🎉🎉
It's the "Bro, I got you" before the kick, that got me!! Some of the best acting right there!!
Best ever storyline.. The bloodline. Miss u bloodline
This is what I waiting for finally the usos turn on Roman
i can replay and replay that moment over and over again, i get chills.
He will take revenge for sure
Bravo
Hmmm ❤
What's crazy is Sami told Roman this would happen. For a really smart guy roman is very dumb. His bloodline was tearing apart and he didn't even know it. Also, Sami Zayn called his shot this time. He said Roman couldn't have the titles.
Aey, listen to me! Listen to me! Listen to me,  Us!   I'm doin'.... what you shoulda done.... a long time ago! I got you!
Jimmy USO definitely win slammy award 4 OMG moment of the Year.
Jimmy almost kick roman head off his shouder wit those two kicks 😂
He did it for the rock
I thought jey would kick roman riegns but jimmy did a good job
The perfect example of when you just can't take it no more
The biggest sweet chin music of the 21st century 😂
Totally did not expect Jimmy to attack!!   Of course, deep down, Jey is glad that happened!!  Storytelling at its best
Super jimmy uso good😂💖
*"I'M DOING WHAT YOU SHOULD'VE DONE A LONG TIME AGO!"*
😂
Main event jimmy uso ☝️
Roman didn't live Jimmy. Next smark down. Real any one family numbers cheat any time. Easy Don't trust any one..............
Jey to solo I'm your brother not him. Jimmy to Jey I'm your brother not him,😂😂 poor roman but he deserved it tbh
“Get out of my ring”
🥺
The outsider's (mine) perspective: This is getting out of hand: now they are three of them!
This clip alone is better than double or nothing. Smh.
The amount of emotion Jimmy had built up in him letting it all out at the end with that scream
😂
I GOTCHU BOW!!!!!!
Finally!! My dream came true
I always said The Usos turning heel alongside Roman never made sense after everything he’s done to them in his beginning reign as champ I’ve been waiting on this for years lmao
I predict Jimmy V Jey
THIS.. IS... GOLD!!!! ⚡ ON A BOTTLE.
Yes about time
About time
The crazy thing is, we thought Jey was going to turn on Roman
Roman got what he deserved
Finally something good …
I don't watch Wrestling any more but Yes I do keep an Update on The Bloodline, Pure Cinema Love it!!!!
Roman selling the superkicks was absolutely beautiful
Jey's character is my favourite, so complex!
Samy Zayn was right when   he said "there's cracks in the bloodline"
IMO Jey is the actual main character in all of the Bloodline storyline
This or Sami's steel chair hit?
To all my brothers and sisters in Christ advancing God's Kingdom, please know that God sees your work for His Kingdom. Don't let anyone discourage you. What you're doing is right and good. Just make sure that your spreading of the Gospel is in love, no matter what. Y'all will be in my prayers. Jesus Bless ❤️🙏
The Tribal Cheat getting superkicked TWICE...THE best moment of the evening & well deserved...ACKNOWLEDGE THAT!!😊 He deserved a 3rd superkick!
It was just a matter of time he has manipulated the Usos against each other for far to long I get it's a story line. But without the Usos roman wouldn't have lasted this long as champ and to treat em that away is his fault now all he has is solo and I can't see solo going against his father yea maybe his brothers but not his father rikishi is a elder and the only reason roman might of had a advantage when they was younger could be cuz rosey  imo
Merecido
l have been waiting for this to happen its twins to action
Chills gonna be hard for them to top this storyline
Sami started it  Jimmy followed    Jey will end it......
Love u roman
Man roman reigns can't turn is back on anyone, though he would have learnt that by now😅😂
2nd kick was phenomenal
Yes !
Best part of the entire night
The whole bloodline/zayn storyline has gotten me back into wrestling after not watching for 10+ years. This storyline has been so much fun to follow
Don't trust anyone😢
Finally!!! I've been waiting for him to kick Roman 😂 he deserved it lol
The fact that this video was trending throughout all YouTube amazing to me. Everyone even people who stopped watching WWE were waiting for this.
The look of intensity from Jimmy he.looked just like his father Rikishi, if Rikishi went to a buffet and they were out of meat and dessert.
And another cinema level storyline by papa H
My dawg.
Roman Reigns vs. Jimmy Uso. For the Undisputed title. Money in the Bank 2023. Make it Happen.
THIS IS NOT OVER ☝️👑
I watch this 100 times just can't stop watching it
Best moment in 2023
I thought sami and bloodline was storyline was peak but this right here climbing up the ranks
Jimmy did what should have been done a LONG time ago!
This right here is peak storytelling.
About damn time
I love how this storyline is going!
This Storyline  has been  building for quite a few weeks now and   obviously the Clues were  quite obvious , The only thing I was not sure  about is  how they  were going to work it.  when it came time,..  Love the way they scripted  it with having  Jimmy & Jey  accidently taking  out Solo with a double Superkick meant for Sami,  before  turning on Roman ,.. with that  said ,... LOVED Paul Heyman's facial expressions & reactions as he was standing outside the ring in the background ,   the looks of shock, and hands over his face was hilarious
Finally it's about time
We The Ones
Finally the bloodline and roman family is over goodbye
Jimmy nailed the moment perfectly!
They watch to much anime
Somebody PLEASE Tell WWE WE WANT JIMMY TO BE THE CHAMP.    HE HAS TO DETHRONE ROMAN.HIM OR THE ROCK. BUT WE DON'T EVEN NEED THE ROCK YET.
Roman reigns trash
a mad man unleashed
That's was best work for roman and his fins 😅😢😂
This is just why  I still watch WWE, the Bloodline... Remove the bloodline, I'm off... Great skills by all of them...
Jimmy uso never support Román Reigns, he want another opportunity
Owsom ❤❤
Quite frankly roman deserve that
As it was scripted, well done.
Finally!
This is what I've been waiting for! My jaw dropped when I saw this. Time for the bloodline to crumble. Roman's title reign is going to come to an end. I can feel it. He's just taken away too many opportunities from other superstars and he can't win without interference. It's someone else's turn now.
The best bit of this was the priceless look on Paul Haymen's face, he is an absolute legend.  One of the best things that has happened to WWE is Paul Heyman
Roman deserve this😂
😂😂😂😂
well done Jimmy he deserved this
There was 3 times i jump of my seat watching the event 1st one was of sadness when the EST lost her champion 😢 2nd one was of Happiness when Sami came warning Saudi dress and then speaks Arabic 😁 3rd one was of utter shock when Jemmy Kick Romen, twice 🤯, if the 1st kick was on rage, 2nd was 100% intentional
The script writer needs to get an award ❤😂😂😂
i love it thats how a real man should act never let anyone treat you like they want it was time to get your revenge congratulations jimmy
Loved it.. F*** roman reigns.. overhyped idiot..
I only have one word to describe this segment, goosebumps!
ROMAN BE LIKE: HUME TO APNO NE LUTA GAIRO MEIN KAHA DUM THA...
I wonder why Roman's legacy has betrayal all the way. . .I think a universal championship between roman and Jimmy is up
Jimmy was the key all along. I'm so mad I didn't get to watch it live, I would have gone completely nuts
Mind game wwe
😡😡😡😡😡 roman 🤛🤛🤛🤜🤜🤜🤜
To me that's  the greatest moment in the history of wrestling
Heard the kick from New Jersey
Good shot Roman deserved that ❤Jimmy best of luck jimmy from 1000 days roman use the Usos brothers love you from Pakistan ❤be happy
Jey acknowledging Roman to protect Jimmy from his wrath, and now Jimmy superkicking Roman to get them—especially Jey—out of Roman's grasp after years of abuse. CINEMATIC.
Cinema 🚬🚬
Fast x was a good movie a lot of action
Ya storyline is turning pretty more interesting..but being a fan of Roman its difficult to digest those kicks on his face..definitely jimmy vl get enough punishment from tribal chief 😍😍
Good jop Jimmy Usso
Who here can't help but watch this video here over and over again
Can't believe what I'm seeing in the comments. This isn't acting. These guys are really out here fighting for their lives and taking real body hits. Jimmies cry was a call for all guys to get out of their seats and kick their own head of tables and to start the revolution of taking down the patriarchy. The era of WWE societal change is here and we must ride this wave all the way til it reaches it end and we'll pick up the pieces of what is left of our socieity. Don't call this acting but what it is, THE GENERATIONS BLOODLINE!
This is wrestling.
Slow burn is the best burn for storyline payoffs.
0:09-0:52
This storyline operates on another level and will live for ever in the hearts of the fans ❤
How much more could he take he finally snapped
If someone do this to my brother in front of me, I would do the same as Jimmy. You did the right thing.
›    I am doing   Which you should have Done  A long time ago  I got you                     Jimmy uso~
I was never this hyped since Rock vs Cena at WM 28
Jimmy did what Jey should've done a long time ago . That's  all . 😂
the instant goosebumps i got when jimmy first kicked the heck out of roman. thought he was gonna regret it after, but when jey attempted to walk towards roman, THE LINES HE DROPPED DOWN WAS JUST POWERFUL. the rage, the anger that he's been bottling up all these years being roman's “errand boys” and the abuse. HE JUST COULDN'T STAND IT MORE ENOUGH. he did it for them twins, he did it for himself, most especially he did it for jey. i'm telling you the first kick was out of instinct. hurting jey in front of him was out of the line for him. HE DID IT FOR HIS TWIN. AND THE SCREAM AFTER, YOU KNEW IT WAS A RELIEF FOR HIM THAT HE FINALLY STOOD UP FOR THE TWO OF THEM. SO SO POWERFUL. smackdown's nothing without them! can't wait for furthermore! kudos to wwe and the bloodline!
Good work roman over
This is one of the absolute greatest face turns I’ve ever seen. Deep down, Jimmy was never a bad dude. He did a lot of bad things, but all in the name of keeping his brother safe. He knew he couldn’t take Roman, but he knew his brother would suffer if he tried to fight him. His interactions with Sami looking back were so brilliant - we all thought he’d finally bought into the Bloodline’s methodology and just used Sami’s need for validation for their own means. Now we know that he truly loved Sami because he could finally drop the act, he could be his true self with another person outside of his family without consequences. And now it’s become clear that he and Jey are in the firing line no matter what they do, he’s dropped the act and kicked his emotionally abusive cousin square in the jaw, and it was so, so satisfying to watch.
Jimmy has always been so sexy to me......now its on a million ❤❤❤
Finally 🔥🔥🔥
슈퍼킥 맛있다~~~
That super kick is in the Mt Rushmore with Shawn Michaels. It will definitely be remembered....Great sell by Roman!!!!! He dropped real hard! Lol
THIS.  THIS IS CINEMA. THIS IS SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT. THIS. IS. PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING!
Usos are the greatest tag teams last decades... They deserve to be alone, not a dog, to tribal chief
Whole bloodline stuff have been sublime. The minute bloodline was looking a bit weak then boom.. The rush the adrenaline.. Wwe are doing some of the very best stuff in the recent years long may it continue.. And paul Heyman's expression at the back 😂 the guy is a genius
Why does my boy roman reigns always gets betrayed
Yessss finally the bloodline is crumbling down
"HIMMY" Uso has arrived
They played Jimmy too well. He kept his emotions close to his chest this entire time, and he just EXPLODED. PHENOMENAL.
Rip Jimmy and jey😢😢 Roman Will punish you 😮
Roman reigns got what he deserved
Jimmy kicked Roman Reigns like he did it for The Rock! Rikishi was that dude
This was and will be remembered at the best moment of the bloodline
very best for brother and brother.... Alghamdulillah God bless him
This video already sitting on 2.3 million in 1 day🤯And White kids behind their keyboards was saying the Bloodline story boring😂
💔😥
The Pure Emotion after that 2nd Superkick!!!! My word that was perfect! Tick Tock
😱😱😱

Kicking him not once, but TWICE! What a golden moment!
Twin
Paul Heymans reaction 😂

Wow
Thank you, Jimmy, I acknowledge you ❤
Very very good performance usos brother ❤🎉🎉🎉 let's celebrate 🥂🥂💐💐
Now that the storyline was getting stale, it's the perfect climax for an epic stroyline. I hope they end it perfectly, without anymore twists.
Roman Deserved this...bcz he Don't Respect his cousins but He use always them...
BLOODLINE☝🏻
fake or real ?
Pls WWE don't finish the story of bloodline and Romans character that's a perfect heel...
AJ STYLES is the man to take those championships off of Roman
Everybody expected Jay to do this, but it was Jimmy all the way!!!!
😂😅😂
Well Job Jimmy he deserved that❤
New story to begin😂😂
Romen deserve super kick 😅
People might act like they don't like Roman reigns,but we reality they love him😂. I want the tribal chief to be our tribal chief for another 1000days
I known for every time because this is wwe, every think happened in wwe.  I hate bloodline and also hate too roman 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
The kicks followed by Jimmy screaming afterwards in a pure release of tension. Brilliant.
Night of the Bloodline
Time to shine jimmy🔥🔥
That no right every one cheat roman first seth second sami zayan and now jimmy I am sad for roman
Love that screeming, so powerful
Roman deserved it😂😂
This is 2010 Randy Orton script 😂
BEST THING GOING IN WRESTLING!!!!
Absolutely amazing. Can Usos win his titles as well?
Goosebumps... Finally an awesome moment for us wwe fans... I watched this video  more than 20 times...  still giving me goosebumps...
Bruh I swear, Jimmy is the one to be quiet all the time, well I guess he's keeping all that anger for so long he snapped!
Jimi love jay a lot
Wow wow I'm also Roman fan .but he deserves this .Jimi is a amazing player.
Well done finally he standed up to romans BS
Yes...yes...right 100 % right.
Roman Reigns deserved it, he does not acknowledge anyone even his team but he wants everyone to acknowledge him!! Jey served him right!! I expected Jimmy to join Jey in that
Jimmy very good play
Ooh mercy!!!
That's what I wanted to see good job jimmy
awesome to see that uso finally took care of there business, they are bros that all they need,
Jimmy screaming after delivering that second Superkick man that was priceless you literally could feel the anger and rage he had against his cousin.....fantastic acting👏
Jimmy looked really badass
U R Great Jimmy USOS
"I GOT YOU"❤️
Bloodline no more Roman reins sucks
I'm proud of jimmy uso❤❤❤
that's Soooooo Sutisfying
The rock wyne johnson is death lama nk mampus wyne johnson ni
I got that joker laugh on me right now... this feels good.
Jimmy Is stupid Roman will destroy him for this
Jimmy Uso is more than a man than Jey Uso
Best Super kick I have ever seen 😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
Brilliant fight ever which each other😂
they made it soo good. jey didnt play a huge part in the act but him saying joe instead of roman just made it feel more realistic. masterpiece
I used to hate the usos but damn lately I really like these guys!!!!
''Im doing what you should have done a long time ago''🔥
after betrayed Roman need to do something bigger 😈💚💚
Please jimmy Respect our tribal chief 😧☝💙
I’ve told some people in my group that The Bloodline storyline is coming to a end in 2023. And the cracks are already forming. But high praises go to Jimmy for FINALLY stepping up and pulling the trigger by turning on Roman. I was shocked and the group that I talked to were shocked as well. And it all started at Royal Rumble. Can’t wait to see the fallout.
Roman empire push jimmy to insanity
That's what I'm talking about jimmy
Jey still acting like the abuse victim who is so used to being abused that he can't stand seeing his abuser get what's coming to him, will pay off so well in the end when he finally lashes out against Roman too.
That explotion of emotion is so beautiful. This storyline is crazy. A perfect way to break the bloodline.
❤❤❤
Everyone is happy 😃 😂😂😂
See the 😅 on my face when he kick him. Even I know it was going to happend and how was going to do it
Naomi should be the tribal chief then lol
Although the Super Kick was great ..Would have loved to see Roman getting chair-shoot again
This video should be the most liked video ever in wwe
Yes jimmy 👏👏👏👏👏
The sound of those 2 kicks are gonna be the sweetest ones in WWE for the next few decades.
This is sick
Finally ❤ Uso now will get better storyline
I'm I the only one not surprise??? Because I know everything is scripted in wwe.
Super usos❤💯👏
Himmy Uso
I’ma Jus Wait Till A “Movie” Of This Drop
INDIA 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 LIKE THIS STORY!!!  MONEY IN THE BANK ROMAN REIGNS AND SOLO SIKOVA VS THE USOS!!!!!
Now it will be some interesting to watch wwe...
🥲🥲🥲🥲😭😭
He snapped! I like when it happens in the right way.
Thankyou Jimmy for representing  millions watching..KO was right Roman Reigns treat you like the appendix ..you are the heart of the table..He needs you but you dont need him
I watch this like 10 times I love a good  storyline Roman deserves this Roman ego cause this happen good one Jimmy
Paul's reaction at the back was like helpless father 😅😅
😄😄
Jimmy will pay for what he did .... waiting for SmackDown live
payback hahahaha..
Its true that Roman is A dominant athlete of all time But Remember After today The Beginning of THE END has started for the BLOODLINE After USOS betrayed Roman
YES YES YES!!! ☝🏻
Subhanallah alhamdullah allah hu akbar la ilaha illallahu muhammadhur rasulallah
Jey you will lose your brother next Friday. Congratulations!
Most satisfying thing ever😊
I hope the Tribal Chief Brutally punishes him! 😂
I hope they don't mess up this storyline. The fact that it was Jimmy who did this..... beautiful.
Love it's movement thanks wwe
Roman is always betrayed whether he is heel or babyface. From seth rollins to sami, jey and now jimmy.
what
very crazy
Finally the moment I have been waiting for
Great turn by Jimmy. Long long time I was waiting for this moment 👌😍
"I'm doing what you should have done a long time ago"
After long time got Cold in my heart .🙏🙏
The bloodline only solo and roman 💔💔😣
Love Jimmy
That scream from jimmy explains it all
The first super kick was out of instinct to protect his brother The second super kick was the shot he can’t take back
very good
Worst storyline for bloodline.. They making powerless romans..
OMG can't believe 😢
Beginning of the end of bloodline at last😅
Very Nice Big Shot Jimmy Roman Ringes Play Boy Lost man😂
A good shot for using them to protect the title.
Roman stays getting betrayed
Roman Reigns deserf this
Bloodline is broken baby
Jimmy didn't superkick because roman pushed him , Jimmy superkicked Roman because he pushed JEy .
No romandiss you friend
Roman wouldn't be able to hold the title that long without the Usos.
i love how time flies. from a terrible face to the beloved heel
To be fair, Roman did deserve it. Ric Flair never treated the rest of the Horseman like that. Hell not even Hollywood Hogan treated the rest of the nWo like that!
THE HEART OF THE TABLE
Time  is up  Roman  Reign
👍👍👍nice
I wish bloodline could have survived more😢.  I don't know where this storyline ends but Roman vs every other member is gonna happen, and who know after fighting solo, the Rock would come finally.
If Jey doesn't get an acting gig after this then I don't know...
Booo Roman Reigns.👎👎👎
👏👏👏
Fantastic Mr.Jimmy Sir.
What a twist! I thought it would be Jey, but I'll take Jimmy doing it too! In the words of Daniel Bryan, "YES! YES! YES!"🤣🤣🤣😁😁😁
Finally
❤❤❤ love from 🇧🇩 bangladesh
Jimmy is the older brother and he got sick of the older cousin Roman bullying them.wonder what the youngest solo going to do
I just loved those two brutal kicks of Jimmy. I acknowledge Jimmy Uso.🤘
Jimmy uso angry man
This is the beginning of ending of Roman reigns,he only used his tribal,his bloodline to keep his titles for 1000 days.
Imagine what Roman did 1 years before ...they got bullied by tribal chief everytime ...now payback time
Waiting for the day when solo turn on Roman.
That kick was for all middle children in family's with elder sons.  On par with a Stone Cold Stunner to every Vince who treated their employees like garbage.
I just got hard no wonder people watch this😅
After a long time there is something good happening in wwe
this was just #2 on Trending for a moment
🧨🧨🧨🧨✨✨✨🎉🎉☝☝☝☝☝
Yes Yes
Roman Never Wrong   Foult in Other Members 😮
🎉🎉
Not feeling ucey.....
Bloodline 😢💔💔
Its just so satisfying everytime  bloodline breaking up part by part.
That "listen to me, listen to me Us, I'm doing what you should have done a long time ago, I got you"...damn....that's love and reassurance from the brother side of things
The storyline gonna very interesting
Why always Roman get betrayed
nice acting😂
Jimmy releasing his pent up emotions.Great storyline ❤
Great story, seriously.  Jimmy is just now seeing what Jey saw months ago.  But, while Jey was talked into coming back, Jimmy had enough.  Also great how they made Roman shoving Jey what finally triggered Jimmy.  You can do all that to him, but NO ONE messes with his brother.
And just like that Roman reopened the USO penitentiary 🔥
Just  whaaaaaaaat ? And whyyyyyy ??😱😱😨😨🤯
Just image 4 years of frustration exploding and producing this much heat in the environment
IS A WAR coming . . what if Jey  Jimmy & Solo⚔️⚔️⚔️  All Team up and then . .  The Big Dog  put back together the  shield 🛡️🛡️🛡️
Yes Roman got wht he deserves beautiful kick by jimmy....
Jimmy Uso did it for Rkishi.. And Rikishi.. did it for the Rock.. And the Rock did it.. It doesn't matter if the Rock did it!!!!!
Pure Cinema!
Fall of Roman Empire
Roman Reigns 🔥
My adrenaline was through the roof when Jimmy the true Tribal Chief superkicked Roman
Finally, the end of the bloodline 😪
Legend.
jimmy is gonna challenge roman for the undisputed wwe universal champion then hes gonna be the new tribal chief and head of the table solo and jey can be the tag team champs too
Roman controlled the real bloodline,now the main bloodline is here 🎉❤😊
Jey uso is a puddy
The best ever tag team of wwe the Usos.... Even far far better than KO n Zayn. They deserve to be champions...
Sure, Jimmy Uso was angry about Roman putting his hands on him, but when he turned his anger on Jey, Jimmy didn't think twice about kicking him. Before The Bloodline, Jimmy said that he would always be his brother's keeper. Well, he just proved that.
Good
That’s how you ride for your twin !!! Gang
Jimmy so good 👍
This was very satisfying 😅
I'm so shock
Yes 🔥🔥🔥🔥 I’m here for Jimmy 😂
What makes this moment even more cathartic and captivating is Jimmy endured that same level of abuse, but snapped when Roman did it to Jey for the first time.
The Bloodline story is better than anything AEW has done all year so far
They trending number 2
Jynmy usos top
Good job 😂
This is long overdue. Roman Reigns has  become a tyrant. It is either his way or nothing
Well delivered usos 😂😂😂😂
Well Jimmy and Jey uso should return now in there old Samoan theme they had in 2015
Best long term storyline I have ever seen! It's like a movie!! Man this is amazing 😍👌🏻
I hope tamina returns in a favour of usos
I seen it coming
Still think they pulled the trigger way to late.
Well. We know who the Tribal Chief is now.
Wooooo once more
Kya baat he 😂 maja aa gaya
2 mil views in a few hours...seems like Martin Scorsese's film trailer to me.
that second super kick. then Jimmy rawr like a lion. all that anger. he wanted to let it all out. he had enough of Romans BS
This Part of my life....This little part its call HAPPINESS🎉🎉
I think my favorite part in this is how he flops out of the ring like a fish.
And I thought that the Writer were on strike ?
one of the most shocker pulledup by the bloodline story. i got the goosebump when jimmy kicked the ist superkick to the roman face. it was like the omg moments
Roman Deserves 😂
Roman had it coming, ITS TRUE
Roman deserved it
Best best best best best moment of wwe
About time, Roman got what he deserved. Jimmy thank you for doing what alot of others wanted to do to Roman
Wwo very enjoyable movement 😂😂😂
Jimmy getting fed up with with his twin being abused and takes matters into his own 🙌. I loved the push and the I GOT YOU !
That’s a good punishment for roman reigns
I just thought Jey and Jimmy gonna go for double super kick when Roman was down but..    Superkick from Jey is coming folks..
After Bryan vs Authority this is my fav storyline from WWE in past 10 years..
AND STILL THE UNDISPUTED WWE UNIVERSAL CHAMPION, ROMAN REIGNS 🏆⚡🐐
This storyline will be awesome
Now is the time to make a great buildup of the bloodline story and then bring in Rock at the next wrestlemania (end game)
Should do a long time ago 😂😂
Now it's getting interesting
Chills from that scream
Crowd exploded 🔥
Jimmy felt those kicks deep down from within and his scream released a lot of frustrations and emotions we may not know about with in the family. I don't think he's that good of an actor that scream was guttural.
I think bloodline well finish 🥺🥺🥺🥺 so sad
I'm watching for the second time just to see Paul's reactions lol
Usos 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm not 🚫 a jay I'm jimmy bro 😎
Thats the best part of the whole match
This is the greatest stuff wwe has ever done
I predict that Rikishi will be involved in this bloodline storyline, just not sure how.,  Maybe to try  to get the bloodline back together as a family . I could also see the usos themselves breaking up somehow due to infighting on either staying with the bloodline or not, kinda feel like Jey wants to stay and Jimmy already demonstrated his out.
Rip  Jimmy
It's a long time coming...
Proud moment lets go jimmy🎉🎉
Man, screw the bloodline. No one disrespects "The Usos"
“We Did it for The Rock”
I can smell someone is cooking 😅
I hope the wrestling industry takes note that long term story telling is still beloved by wrestling fans. 🤘
Jimmy Uso Was Underrated In Bloodline Storyline But He Perfectly Play His Role In This Segment 🔥👑 Now He Looks Like Next Level Jimmy Uso 🌟
Dead crowd ☠️☠️
Amazing storyline. Will be interesting to see how Solo Sikoa reacts eventually.
Bloodline Imploded, best storyline ever.
Jimmy Uso time to be in the spotlight was a long time coming. I love Roman but he deserved those super kicks for disrespecting family
Serves Roman right for abusing his family
This is so satisfying 🤣
Content n the story telling is the king this line is proved once again by wwe in 1 day 2 million view for this video this proves how much people love the story of bloodline thank you hhh
Night of champions was a bit dull to me but this moment/match and the Gunther match made it worth watching.
Jimmy is gonna get a rough beatdown after this💀
"I'm doing what you should've done a long time ago"  Man Chills. Literally Chills ! This is Art
Ah.. The satisfaction is beyond words
Roman is the GOAT performer!!  The way his face bounces off the canvas after the first superkick!!  Its the little things he does
He the one
I honestly dont understand how people actually think this is great storyline...i mean it was a great storyline, one of the best for sure, but after wrestlemania it went down hill & just got repetitive...How many times we gonna see someone from the group "come to their senses" & go against Roman? Lmao is Heyman next too?
Now what I predict will happen Jimmy will get a title shot and Jey and Solo will interfere and help Roman as always but Sammy and Kevin (I hope) will subdue them and befriend Jimmy Uso
Roman deserve this 😂
Why uso why he is your brother😢
Jimmy's intensity has me sold
Im feeling uss baby
Respect u uso u love your real brother roman is not your brother he is just part of the family now the three usos brothers solo jimy and jey  will destroy roman
The best storyline in the history of professional wrestling
Jimmy Uso did best for business Roman Reigns title will be end
The Tribal Fraud deserved to get kicked in his face
now the bloodline broke up it seems like Roman is upset and Roman is going to be the big dog and not the chief anymore this is madness
Jey almost laugh😂
he deserve this f##### kick 😉
Incredible. Basically when enough is enough. Sami was right about Roman the entire time. Roman has become the narcissist he truly thinks he is and that was enough. Don’t be surprised….if Jimmy was talking to The Rock. Because we might get Rock-Reigns at WM.  The Bloodline has imploded.
The world has acknowledged Jimmy USO for his contribution at Night of Champions and this man will not only be known for this contribution but the commitment to his brother ☝🏾
😮😮😢😢😢😠😠😠
I was expecting to see Roman and Solo as the new tag team and in a re-match they would lose all their titles  as USO betrays Roman and new money in the bank would take his other titles... Gzzz this story is end of everything no fun story lines
Jimmy sold that perfectly...the quote to Jey, his facial expressions, the screaming... amazing performance
Good job 👍
This was the best feeling ever... Jimmy turned on roman, then jey and solo should turn on him now as well.. Roman should be dethroned now
I loved this 😍 what a kick to Roman
Wrong story Roman Reigns loss match
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savjjr
This is perfect, while a lot expected jey to make that move, jimmy finally let his emotions out and made the right, long-waited decision, the “ i got you “, the way he confronted his twin and told him he should have done that a long time ago, respectful to his brother but yet so real. Finally roman getting what he deserves.
The real Samoas usos❤️
I was literally shocked when Jimmy hits the first kick to roman .... I didn't expect that to happen , even in that match..but the way wwe manipulating the story,it was perfect !  Well done WWE ! Jimmy also done a great job there !
YESSSSSSSS🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The end of the bloodline !
That was effing awesome. Jimmy may be my new favorite wwe superstar. I haven’t popped for anything from wwe in a long time like I did for this. He’s gonna be over like Rover as a face 😯
😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡🤬uso
Should've done in MITB so the MITB winner can cash in....
That second kick was just...
Go Jimmy 🙏🙏 yes yes my bro 💪
Lastly usos show the meaning of wwe to Roman,,,the real game..by amazing kicking..
Very good👍
I have been waiting for this moment for a long time finally its happened 👎🏻
I would also have done it if the head is so greedy
I hate the bloodline😢😡
The End                  Bloodline
Acknowledge that Roman, two boots to the head 🤣🤣🤣🤣
One more superkick from me 😂
😂😂😂 theatre drama
Roman reigns make us Piss!😡😡😡
loved this
Loved the expression of Paul Heyman
When Jimmy said I got you. I felt dat 😢
Finally there script against Roman like that 🤣🤣🤣
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Ya era hora 😁
Here’s 1000 days ruined all my God
Roman is now 1000 days champion. But out of those 1000 days, 800 days or more he is the champion because of the Usos.
And just because of that, Jimmy Uso become the hottest star in wwe.
Man oh man!!!
Good riddance now the usos has to team up with sami amd ko to take out the solo and roman
Paul Heyman looked so shocked by what happened he don't know what to say
Sad for Roman 😢
Bout time!
That was a long time coming! Jimmy Uso did something that Hey Uso should've done a long time ago. Roman Reigns deserve every bit of it! Good job Jimmy!!
Wow wow what an act 😂
The greatest storytelling in wwe history...  And it's not even close 🔥🔥🔥
I am expecting Jey or Solo to turn on Roman not jimmy...😅Now this storyline is become epic
This should trend #1
Bro slid on my Tribal Chief !
And yet they backed Reigns up when he  started feuding with Sami, only to turn on him themselves later.
I was expecting jey to be the one to do this the entire time it kept building up. The fact it was Jimmy Uso to super kick Roman not once, but TWICE...was amazing. This is easily the the best story line ever to happen in the WWE.
The second kick from Jimmy was lit 🔥🔥
Jey is gonna bring down the Bloodline
But isn’t solo their own brother too? So  the usos doesn’t love their youngest brother? Why they left him with roman? No way solo fighting their own brothers to help roman. 😮
I dont see why anyone in these comments and in the wwe universe is surprised by this we all knew that this day was coming sooner or later
Changing gears for a second, the way Roman mushed Jey is reminiscent of how the Miz mushed Alex Riley, causing Riley to snap and beat the Miz out of his clothes!😆😆  …but Roman had that receipt coming though!😆😆
Nice Kick 😂😂
Yes yoy are the tribal chief indeed
YEAHHH BOYYY😂😂!!!
That's how you feel adrenaline in the soul
if someone were to mush brother's face even ONCE I would that to them
This kick to me meant WAYYY more than Samis chair shot.
When he said, I Gotchu and kick the tribal Cheif it gave me goosebumps.
Jimmy uso sucks
Jimmy will pay for this kind of selfishness ⁉️
Roman fans eerily quiet rn, as if they suddenly realise how toxic his reign has been.
I thought this whole time jey would be the on to snap and boy jimmy brought the heat
Wrestling better then movies 😢
"I'm doing what you should've done long time ago" phenomenal
everyone liked that
Very good, Jimmy, no more undermine
At the end when Jey was calling to Roman as Joe (his real name, obviously) made it hit harder. Great storytelling with The Bloodline.
And this is called Cinema🔥🔥the storyline,acting ,high drama,pure emotions,the betrayal,the buildup..
Triple threat tag team championship next.
this bloodline story really made sami , kevin , usos , solo and roman stars
I was never much of a fan of the usos. But dam this story line got me hooked the way Jimmy sold that like”I GOT YOU IM YOUR BROTHER NOT HIM” followed by 2 superkicks just made it so good
What a kick ......listen that sound 😊
Only a matter of time...great story line written.kuduos to all involved..
roman was like "WHY IS IT ALWAYS ON ME WHEN MY TEAM BREAKS UP???"
I thought Jimmy's eyes were going to pop out his head looking at Roman I mean he was so angry it wasn't even funny although I'm sure that after the match they al probably went out for dinner or maybe breakfast
Long term storytelling at its best. I don't know who writes their story, but that person has to be treasured.. Lot of props to all of them involved on screen - top tier acting by all of them; you can feel their emotions. Roman being the perfect antagonist, Jimmy having had enough screaming it out was "God mode"
I know the story is fake but man it's still entertaining 🤣
To WWE Creative -One of the best things you have done after very long time
Roman got what he deserved  just a matter of time before Jimmy snapped
Now that's a SUPER kick!
That’s so damn awesome
Nothing got me happy than dah scream from Jimmy when he gave the second kick to Roman, I enjoyed Dah so much Dah I screamed with him dammmmn……..Roman had it coming he doesn’t appreciate anything The USO’s do for him.
👏
This is on the same level as Sami Zayns turn
He had the same look on his face when the cops pulled him over for his last DUI.
I love how jey already went against Roman and got put in his place but jimmy hasn’t so he is more rebellious jey wants to be on his brothers side but he’s torn because of Roman the long term story telling is crazy
I figured it would be Jey not Jimmy that would do that but either way I'm glad it happened Roman finally got what he deserved and hopefully he will lose a belt soon too
He called him joe
Long term storyline @ it's best... Great work
Jimmy betray roman
Absolutely  Speechless 😶😶😶....
hmm surprise
3 years of pent up anger. Roman is getting what he deserves for humiliating his cousins since the start of the decade. “I got you” and that scream after the second kick was everything
That scream that he let out. It felt too real, like it was actually cathartic to let out all that pent up emotion from years back.   Everyone in this story deserves major props. It has everything - drama, excitement, comedy, heartbreak, sorrow and passion. Adding Sami was a stroke of genius that finally allowed them to have an exit strategy for the story but they did so in a way that was organic and natural.   We haven't seen long term storytelling like this in a while and I'm glad the fans appreciated it while it was happening and living in that moment too.
Jay Uso and Paul Heyman was in a state of shock after Jimmy Uso superkicked Roman Reigns. Jimmy had enough of Roman's disrespectful verbal abuse. I see a tag team matchup of Roman Reigns/Solo Sikoa vs. The Usos
😂 That was a superkick from the universe 😂😂
The first true crack in The Bloodline.
Why...🥲💔💔💔
nice acting
Why can't everyone have a storyline this great?
Super  I am happy
Thanks jimmy you did a great job
WWE 👊 superstar Sami Zayn performed Umrah 🕋 ahead of the WWE Night of Champions 2023 event in Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦 and described it as the ‘best experience’ of his life ❤️.
Nice Acting
Rat
Best storyline and execution I've seen in WWE in a long time!
Finally, wwe pulled the trigger!! They kept us engaged for so long, made us wait and allowed us to become a part of this story! We all became Jimmy Uso at NOC!!! One of greatest wrestling stories ever told!!
😓😭😭
Finally, now he can lose a match as he has less goons
roman reign best friend is not uso only dean ambrose i love this funny guy is most perfect friend roman reign
Finally!
Wow I was wondering win this was going to happen
loved this...
Jimmy Uso owned the LOUDEST SUPERKICK IN THE WORLD
This Is awesome Jimmy 😮
"I got you." POWERFUL.
Top three storylines of all time
Roman regins deserves it!! They helped him and he is not seeing that !!
This story line is going to get GOOD NOW LOL 😆 😂
I've been waiting for this for sooooo loooong..... Thanks @JimmyUso
I jumped from my seat when Jimmy super kicked Roman!
Jimmy never forgot it was HIM on that guillotine lock that made Jey say I Quit.
Awesome
KARMA hits hard, isn’t it ROMAN?
Jey is my favourite character, so layered and complex! The abuse made him feel unworthy of breaking free. Roman used his twin, loyalty and family to mold him like he wanted. What's fascinating though is that no matter how much he was manipulated, Jimmy is always his first priority. Now Roman is a psycho and he could get him to turn on Jimmy or maybe by being free Jimmy could help him free himself..Can't wait!!
I loved every sec of how this broke down
Bro we all thought Jey was the one to superkick Roman reigns but nope
The Bloodline storyline is meant to make Jimmy Bigger people don't know that yet. Imagine Jimmy being a champ, telling every opponent that he had to face his biggest fear. Jimmy fears Roman Reigns so now it's up to him to either face him or lose his brother forever. Moral of the story - you can always chose to face your fears or run away and fear forever.
I just notice something when jimmy super kicked Roman jimmy got the heel side of his dad and jey got the good side of his dad at night of champions last night and if i know Roman he is going to put hands on jimmy this Friday on smackdown just you wait
Ehhh. Puerto Rico fans were better
If I had to choose between having this moment happening again and my future, damn let it happen again. Absolutely want the world to enjoy this
It's should have been do it a long time ago and super shot by Jey usso🤨🤨😡😡😠😠🖤
It was about time babe
I'm doing what you should've done a long time ago....
Honestly if I really had my way, I would have Rakishi, Rock, his daughter, Afa and Sika basically everyone that is alive and around. I know there are some other people in the indies and do a whole huge Civil war angle. People switching sides and spying. It has never been done before. Nothing is as destructive as a civil war.
That moment when jey is worried and concerned for his brother cause he knows what is coming for him…
Damn It Jimmy is my hero
I LOVE this story line lol
be friends 🤷🤷
Freaking hot cheetos. This gonna be REAL  good
This enitre bloodline story brought back old feelings i had for the show as a kid in the late 90s early 2000s.  The emotiom Jimmy was epic.
👏👏👏👏
Friday is gonna be absolute cinema
Ggood........beautiful
শেষ
After Roman sounds like Seth's part "Do you understand me?" *Chuckling* and then there was Jimmy Uso, used to superkick on Roman and he has enough of the Tribal Chief. Therefore, Roman is a WWE Universal Champion/WWE Champion/Undisputed WWE Champion. Who's gonna challenge Roman for the double WWE titles? Cause he's was TOO POWERFUL to use for his titles!
That's a long time overdue
Roman treates his kuzen jimmy and jay he thinkes he the man number 1
This seems like Jimmy uso is about to take some time off. He is probably going to get smashed for this and then solo and jay are going to be roman’s resident lackies for a while.
Wow ❤❤❤ USOs ❤❤❤
In today's WWE I don't mark out for stuff..But this moment had me marking out like a kid again. So satisfying
Jimmy fought Roman ,anyway so no shock here.
I need to watch months of WWE to understand what led to this
It should have been done before already. I don't vibe with Reigns but Usos are doing great!
This is what you get when humiliate too much to someone
People expected jey and Jimmy was the swerve
About time!
🔥🔥🔥😍👏💪
It's still real to me, dammit!
It be your own family😊
long overdue.... Jimmy first to strike Sami and the first to strike Roman... strike first talk later... 🔥
UUUUSSSSSOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
No need to argue this is the best storyline WWE ever made in history.
Roman reign has been through enough getting hit twice by steel chair and betrayed by his cousins.
A brother's love is something that can't be described. It's a strong bond
When I saw jimmy kick Roman I past out
So sad broken to bloodline
Jimmy's had enough!
This hits different for me because my life is like this storyline right now..
what a weird soap opera
He did what needed to be done! The fall of the empire
#2 on trending!
TRIBAL CHIEFS AROUND THE WORLD KNOWS YOU FKD UP USO!!!!!!!!!
"keep your hands off my brother!"
OMG!!!!!!!!!  GET THE SUPERMAN PUNCH!!!!!!!  NOW!!!!
I haven’t got chills in a long time from watching WWE.   THIS!!! Is how you tell a story 🎉
The look on Jey's face when Jimmy super kicked Roman said it all. He looked at him like what the F did you just do. Jey didn't want to leave Jimmy had to force him, jey knows how dangerous Roman can be when angry. Even when they were at the ramp jey was still in shock and was fearing for Jimmy's life. Jimmy has been holding a grudge since he suffered that submission move in the hell in a cell match. He played it well when everyone was focused on jey even when sami turned on the bloodline nobody suspected Jimmy to be the one to turn on Roman.
The bloodline is over.
What a pay off
2 million views in one day... that's how you move the needle anoai style, we'll Jimmy in the world title main event at money in the bank
Ludicrous..   people are going to believe Roman and the Usos have turned against each other.   But it's not true. When and if The Freak goes against Roman for the heavyweight champion belt..  The Usos are going to help Roman win that title..  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I almost super kicked my dog after this
New member is going to join bloodline
Bloodline💔💔💔💔💔💔
The way Jay looked at jimmy after  that second super kick
I'm still in shock😮
U can tell jimmy is beyond tired of roman reigns and definitely tired of being treated like trash.
Jimmy just super kick roman 😂😂😂😂
Jimmy and Jey best tag team in WWE in the modern era. Great story line. Can’t wait to see where this goes
#2 trending, 2 million views in 1 day, give Jimmy both reigns belts , and bring back the nobody's b*tch shirt
This is wrestling poetry ❤️
Jimmy finally snapped i though it was go be jey but it makes sense and jimmy saying he got jey was so cute ❤😢😊
I've been looking forward to watching this for the rest of my life.😂😂😂
How dare him Super Kick my Tribal Chief?
It's about time!!!!!
This is awesome what the usos did.
Feel bad for Roman but he brought this upon himself by mistreating The Usos
Tht second super kick was damn nasty one
the story within this thousand day reign is why it’ll go down as the greatest in history
Jimmy super Kicked Roman to the YouTube trending #2. Jimmy is sure tribal chief
All story line for the Wwe cousins wouldn’t fight against each other their uncle the Rock wouldn’t agree with this 😂😂😂😂😂
The biggest pay off of all time! I can't wait to see what will be the next phase for the Bloodline. The next big question is who will dethrone Roman Reigns now?
Not sure which one was more poetic. Sami's chair shot or Jimmy's kick. Both will be remembered for years to come.
Roman deserve that double super Kick 😊
One of the moments of all time. Proud of them for growing some balls
Sienten lo  qué la Roka esta cocinando
That was awesome
The only way to DE-THRONE the Tribal Chief is to have Jimmy take the Universal Championship and Jay take the WWE Championship.That would be the perfect ending story to the Roman Empire.
Rarely do you see something to do with wrestling on trending
هو الل وصلهم لكده
Jimmy literally kicked Roman's head out of his head
Chills smh.....this story is movie worthy
Bloodline storyline was the best storyline ever that created by wwe, it start with jey fight with roman for tribal cheif, untill now
En efecto esto es megacine 🍷🗿🚬
Jimmy The head of the table.
I've always imagined that Jay is gonna turn on Roman but Jimmy? Damn that was a surprise I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it irl😂
Imagine the MOMENT with crowd of UK tour or in MONTREAL, they literally would had fired the roof.
Moment of the year?
The sell on the 2nd super kick is legendary. Perfect execution
This has to be fake
Over/under on how many times we replayed the second kick right before he says "I got you" and the scream. I'll say 10.
I swear when Jey said "You gotta do better than that!" I wanted him to then say "You gotta do it like this!" Then super kick Roman's head off. Lol would've been even more of a classic. Big Roman fan, but he had this coming. Lol
i dont think that scream was part of their script 😂😂😂
Jimmy Uso was Fed Up with Roman reigns bullcrap he had it coming Nomo bloodline
That scream man. I felt that.
the fact it started with jimmy using his left, and then the right, the right foot being jeys kick, paid it forward, looking forward to see whats next.
Super kicked the part timed out of him 😂💀
Now saudi crowds are getting better on every ppvs .....
Wtf just happen
Wow
Nice script
Wwe give who ever wrote this story line a raise ong they earned that...epic in every!
😂😂😂 I can’t stop watching this is to funny
And so begins the rebellion!
The "I got you" is going to be a t-shirt. Watch.
Another great PLE, can't wait for MITB now!
Good kicks
We are always going to remember the year 2023 in WWE. Every show this year has been a banger. And now we going to London for MITB!?
This is not a betrayal, this is liberation.
Can we also talk about Paul Heyman's face after those Superkicks to Roman?
Thank you WWE. This was my new favorite video!
As they say, "There comes a time when you will understand your position, or someone else will come to put your arrogance in the place that belong"
I got chills when this happened
I think today match is classic. Last 999 days... People are boring. Because of 999 days are same script RUBBISH.
🤗🤗🤗
The tribal sheif is going to smash the usos 🙂
That one felt good 👍🏽. Jimmy did the right thing lol 😂😂
Amazing moment
So glad The bloodline is disbanded sort of, maybe Jimmy Uso could beat Roman he knows the ins and outs of him maybe just maybe...
LETSS GOOOOOOOOO
It's sad that I already saw this coming
When Jimmy hollered that's all the frustration he was holding in.. I felt that.. well deserved Roman... Acknowledge that
They should've pull this at wrestlemania rather than sacrificing cody to reigns
Roman over sold the second super kick, Jimmy barely hits him and Roman threw himself as if he actually kicked him 😂
R we seeing end of Roman Reigns from now onwards,buz he wants to be with her family.😯😭
Jey actually looked scared. LOL! Jimmy went full Rikishi on Roman.
I’m happy he did this. Time someone put the Tribal Thief in his place. 💪🏾💪🏾☝🏾☝🏾
The Bloodline had so much more to accomplish. Adding a female member, giving Solo a title. I love how they've taking their time with this split. It's great! But im sad too 😂
Y'all ever noticed that Jimmy never actually outright acknowledged Roman?
Finally Jimmy USO has took his life back  would love to see Jimmy wrestle reigns without any interference from jey or Solo
Awesome,  they finally pulled the trigger and dealt with Roman  and him and Solo get some 😅😂
Worse storyline in the history of wrestling.
Roman Reigns is about to be hurting as the protection goes away on either Raw or Smackdown that with a interesting next story with a complete break up
Oh that was so damn good.
I'm gonna call it now  Usos v solo and roman at summerslam solo turns on roman and joins with the usos when roman doesn't know then fast forward to the royal rumble and solo wins to face roman at mania but when the entrances happen solo walks out with the usos and roman is weak and then solo wins and dethrones roman
Roman is finished.
It was about time
My brother’s keeper💪🏾
Look at Jimmy, everyone loves Jimmy! Look at that smile!
THEY NEED TO WALK OUT TO THEIR OLD USO WALKOUT   Where they come out together and do that transitional anthem and then their music. That was sick.
Remember it was jey who originally clapped reigns with a chair. Remember it was Jimmy who came to jeys aid and stopped roman from further hurt and told him enough was enough he ain't have to  keep going. Jimmy always been that dude 💯
All three sold this perfectly.
Thanks for spoiling that 👍🙄
Paul Heyman is in control of this entire storyline that’s why it’s so great
Jimmy uso vs roman reigns 🔥
Beautiful 😢
I think wwe is pushing jey vs roman... Bec Jimmy and sami always remembering jey what he needs to do.. Jey is the first one who's against roman to all of these and now he got forced by roman to follow the line in I quit match by hurting his brother Jimmy I think it's time jey to finish what he started...
Perdón por tanto cine pero así es The Bloodline champagne 🚬
And Paul just stood there at let solo get pinned, and Jey called out to Roman and called him (JOE) did anyone else hear that
Jimmy being the one to do it is amazing, all the signs pointed to Jay from the start
It was due for a long time UCE
This all started at night of champions now it’s ending at night of champions
Wwe if you would have done this in Puerto Rico you would have caused a damm earthquake in that island with the roar 🦁 of the people. They a have bigger venue , more people and still the Island of Puerto Rico is # 1 so far this year !!
Long time comin lol
the best time to be wrestling fan
Say what you want but jimmy and jey should've delivered the superkick
A sigh of relief. 😜
The betrayal is too good it made it to #2 trending.
Usos vs Roman for WWE universal blabla; they can use freebird rules
did Roman and Solo lose this march
emotional males (feminine trait) combined with testosterone. This is a recipe for dangerous humans. You guys push this as normal, and you are creating the next school s hooter, the next car jacker, the next armed robber, the next domestic violence suspect. the average male growing up watches this and thinks this is the way to act in real life.
what a moment l Can belive jemmy dis that ❤
The fact that Jimmy was the first to embrace Sami to super kicking to now actually listen to him is still mind boggling to me.
I can't believe this!
My buddy died  last night on the 1000 day. He predicted all of this. To bad he didn’t get to see it 😥
Damnnnnn 😂😂😂😂 awesome jus awesome
POR FIN POR FIN DIOS MIO NO MAS EL LINAJE LO QUE TODO EL MUNDO QUIERE VER NO MAS ROMAN REINGS COMO CAMPEON POR FIN POR FIN
The Best  Shot.. I have Heard.. After a looonggg time. 😂😂cheers 🥂 baby uso
I felt the anger inside Jimmy with that scream 🔥
Take This Big Dog 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Failure 😆😆
Well jimmys definitely feeling ucey after that 😂😂
This entire storyline was never about Roman and his titles, it’s more than that, it’s about The Usos- the brothers who would do anything to protect each other from Roman’s abuse. At this point it doesn’t even matter if Roman will hold on to the titles for another 1000 days. There’s just way too much respect,love,emotion and agony poured into the Bloodline story and I can’t wait to see where this goes. Thank you Trips for giving us this cinema level storyline🥺
😢😢😢 very sad
Sami Zayn broke Jey remember I don’t give a damn what the Tribal Chief said. Kevin Owens broke Jimmy  together they’ll break Solo because Solo is there waiting for Roman to put his hands on his brother again
🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👍🤝
Why do I find this so attractive 😂😅
😢
I have been waiting like 8yrs for this moment.
THIS IS CINEMA!
What's the name of the song at the end?
Heat,Pure Fire! But some things haven't been said. 1. The Usos just caused Solo Sikoa his first Title.2. The Usos didnt turn on Roman, Jimmy Did....Jey wasn't with it....
*What everyone has been waiting ✊🏿*
I'm doing what you should have done a long time ago       - Nobody's Beach
These two can sell anything and everything I felt that emotion pend up rage and brotherly love and it's about time they broke free of the tyranny of Roman Reigns
beatifull
Roman Reigns is an unstoppable force and he just met the unmovable object jimmy USO
Bet Roman will be eating out of a straw after that one good on ya Jimmy😂
He cleaned Romans clock twice
Finally the Roman Reigns era is about to come to an end and I couldn’t be more happier😂😂
About damn time! 🎉
Cody was right about the Usos and Roman Reigns it will be a match as a handicap match as the the Usos tear up Roman Reigns on a live show
The Ucey... has been unleashed!!
Jimmy uso is gonna fight roman reigns and get the universal champion
I Felt this !!! ❤
Story lines and the wrestling is terrible
Best wrestling storyline in DECADES. This is why Roman went over Cody. The Bloodline has to crumble before Roman falls.
The way he screamed after that second kick, and the line "I'm doing what you should've done a long time ago" was goosebumps inducing. At this point it's not even acting, very few times has wrestling felt so unscripted. This storyline should go down as a lesson for scriptwriters and wrestlers alike, just like Savage vs Steamboat at Wrestlemania 3 was the standard tutorial on how to have a perfect match.
Jey looking at Jimmy like “man, he’s right”
Younger bros be watching and feeling like heroes . Older bros be watching and tearing up knowing jimmy, the little bloodbro, respects jey enough to sacrifice themselves. Now thats a true bro's bond. I GOTCHU!!!!!
I always thought it'd be Jey that would lose it.   Jimmy broke first. Roman going after his title was too much for him to stomach.
Roman cross line when stop respect Usos.. they not employees of him 👎
USOOOOOO LONG
“It’s me and you now” Daaamn!
So triple threat match is coming soon... The uso vs roman+solo vs sami+owens.
Jimmy Uso has finally got guts with Roman Reigns and it was overdue for last night
man's savored that kick
You have to give the usos credit now
Jimmy Ucey kiss Brandin Stephens.
At McDonald's 🍟 I'm loving it! 😆
IS OVER
The bloodline was ended
What If this Moment take Place in WWE Own arena in USA?? Audience Goes Wild with Huge Pops!!!
Qui il discorso è che, o che era già tutto scritto che doveva finire così, o è stata una sorpresa per tutti, la cosa strana è che avrebbero dovuto chiudere tutto a modo loro, polliciata o svenimento, invece hanno sottovalutato tutto, che succederà? Sikoa sfiderà Reings e vincerà? Seno'  sfideranno gli usos?
☝🏾☝🏾💔💔🥺🥺
☝🏾🥺💔
☝🏾☝🏾🥺💔
Jimmy is right should have a long time ago
THE   DOWNFALL   OF   BLOODLINE
Man it SUCKS to be Roman. Man's getting betrayed by everyone including his family.  First Rollins, then Sami and now Jimmy..... 🥲💔
A question, is it possible to give the board of the Emmy's a recommendation for an award, because they NEED an Emmy for this! This was INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Protect his brother
I told you before that The Usos (Jimmy Uso & Jey Uso) will split from The Bloodline. Sami Zayn already left Bloodline to reunite with Kevin Owens. Very soon Solo Sikoa will turn on Roman Reigns to join The Rock and Paul Heyman will be advocate again.
Sooo satisfying
Epic, it took long enough to happen.
This was a PURE MASTERPIECE.....  had goosebumps after the 1st superkick and literally felt the scream and rage of Jimmy after the 2nd one.....  HATS OFF TO THIS STORYLINE. Its truly a Blockbuster turn for the BLOODLINE I truly acknowledge this....... ❤ This would be remembered as one of the wildest moments in modern wrestling era .....
Okay if this did not give y'all the highest climax level of Goosebumps sigh idk what else would Love it tho
Great moment for putting up Jimmy in this moment.  It really was Jey's story all along. He's the heart of the Bloodline.
Best script so far
About time
We was waiting on it to happen
Jimmy USO will soon be one of the greatest baby faces of all time after this.
It’s about time Jimmy kicked Roman Reigns and it was a long time coming 😅
"I'm your brother not him -  I got you" Jimmy usso❤
That scream from Jimmy Uso was RAW emotion
This storyline keeps on giving.
Man Romen Is gonna kill Jimmy next week on smackdown 😅
I understand being the younger sibling! You get tired of being bullied!!
Finally
I'll bet u fans jim.corenet vould kick the pics out Paul heyman
You could hear how Jey was concerned after the first kick, but the look after the second kick and Jimmy’s roar of pain and rage shows the reality of who Roman Reigns really is because of Sami’s words.  Plus, from Jimmy kicking Reigns not once but twice, he didn’t just do it for himself, he did it for both him and Jey. If I was in Jimmy’s position and I superkicked Roman, I would feel relief from doing it. Although I would love to give one more to Roman. Can’t wait for SmackDown! ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
This goes to show without the uso Roman will loose
Paul Heyman definitely not on same levels Bobby the brain Hernan definitely not same levels Jim coronet give me an f break
"I'm doing what you should've done a long time ago"          THESE WORDS THAT I USED TO SAY SINCE 2020 AFTER JEY FALLED IN LINE🔥🔥😈😈
Theresa's classy Freddie brassy etc bobythe brain heenen pull Heyman aintveven onthexsame levelasfriken manager as Jim corenetvgivecme a f break
Finally🎉I've never been so damn happy
Bloodline is over wooooooooo🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Mi boi Roman finally has been betrayed this some good stuff ngl 😂
Jimmy vs Roman reigns at SummerSlam for the World Title
Since roman debut How many times he got pushed...got main event..title opportunity...title reign(instead the longest reign in wwe) Why he got so many where others superstars like AJ,nakamura,drew,seth,sheamus,bray,lashley didnt get much though they r far more capable than roman i think.... Roman is also good But opportunities should go and run everyone equally
Like I'm surprised people are still shocked about jimi's actions
So happy this happened
Greatest WWE storyline ever
This was so intense so intense
What Jay should have done a long time ago indeed
OMG,JIMMY USO SHOCKED THE WORLD
I forgot fans was Bobby Hernan mouthofthe South forgot paulelerring and o yeah the shirt Jim Cornette which fricken Heyman never got to as manager
WWE please save Sasha Banks from all people, anyone, step for me, please help her, listen to me.
I figured Jimmy was gonna snap but it played out a little different than I had expected. I think the way WWE executed it was far better.
Good job Jimmy.  Roman treated you guys like servants. You needed to kick him.
Wow all i say is Wow😮😮😮😮
The show last night sucked but the ending was masterfull
FINALLY
The Usos gonna come with a backup soon.. It's gonna be the people's champion. New tribal chief. Gonna be electrifying ⚡
There's boby the brain heenan James j Dillon the mouth of South Paul never got to that level
این حرکت  نتیجه احساس و تحقیر بود
roman had it coming brilliant story written with gold
Then we're Paul Heyman from there hahaha who cares traitor to leaner who cares
HELL YEAH UCE
lettttssss go!
this is awesome.... i wud love if they include rikishi on this saga aswel... cz its a turmoil now in the bloodline
All respectable Samoans before Roman never acted like some head of table yet they were as mighty as they come. This should have done a long ago but WWE has no other dragging storyline. Instead of individual success they were all minions under him.
I don't believe reigns could take solo he trained by his pop relishing new world champ solosakoa
this is awesome.... i wud love if they include rikishi on this saga aswel... cz its a turmoil now in the bloodline
It's about time 👍
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Solo is younger more stamina trained by pops r rekishi
“I got you!” And 2nd kick. 10/10
I don't believe reigns could take solo Samoa in a street fight
this will b the most liked video on this channel
So fake how long did Roman just sit there waiting for that kick 😂😂😂😂
Jimmy was ROARİNG after the second kick. Coolest thing ever!
This story make sense for the Rocks return now
Roman put a lot of pressure on them. Look at Jimmy's body language.
Solo aintsaid to much if solo wasntvpresentvdrewxwould be champ ifcusous wernt presntvreignsxwould be champion  solovs tribal cheif for undistupedchampionship no damnusous Roman solo has his brosxthecusous in his corner
I can't stop watching it😮😮😮
Jey next please ❤
Finish the story at SummerSlam ❤🎉
The Bloodline will soon collapse to HELL
FINALLY - in The Rocks voice.... SNOREman Reigns, BOREman Reigns, Tribal QUEEF
After a PPV that had good but not great matches, this match and the aftermath were a great payoff.
“YOU AINT NO DAY ONE NO MO!!!”
This week smackdown is awesome
So much emotion! I love it!!!
😍😍😍😍🙌🙌
There's gonna be consequences for jimmy uso...
This to lead us to jey uso dethroning Roman Reigns
Roman "We aint Day 1s no more" Jimmy's Foot enters the chat...... Roman's chin exits ....,.

So satisfying to watch 😀
GOD CREATED US TO LOVE US AND EVEN THOUGH WE SINNED AGAINST HIM HE DID NOT ABANDON US,BUT MADE A WAY FOR US TO BE RESTORED TO HIM THROUGH HIS SON JESUS;WHO DIED IN OUR PLACE AND IS RISEN...TRUTH.PRAYING IS TRUSTING THAT GOD HEARS YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HIM AND MEANING WHAT YOU SAY...LETS PRAY,LORD JESUS I BELIEVE AND WELCOME YOU INTO MY LIFE,AMEN.*READ AND SPEND SPEND TIME WITH GOD DAILY,PUT YOUR TRUST IN HIM*ASK GOD TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HIS WORD*ALLOW THE HOLYGHOST TO LEAD YOU...I LOVE YOU BUT GOD THE TRINITY LOVES YOU UNCONDITIONALLY.
Best thing I seen on wrestling in years!!
Literal, " You Deserve It" To Roman🔥
He actually kicked Roman in the head for real
This is a masterpiece! The tension, adrenalin, the perfect moment. I like Cody, but man i would love to see those belts on Jimmy. ☝️
I've been waiting for this 👏🏾 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Damn super kick was felt
It's about time, jimmy got tired of the disrespect
0:16 What did he do? He snapped. Never thought I'd say thank you.
This is sad😢
“I did what you should’ve did years ago”
I feel sorry for him come Monday
Told you it would be satisfying as hell 😂🙏🏾
Uso is back
Knw one like to be bully for too long on that's a fact 🔥🔥🔥😅😅😅
Don't think ifcreigns pushes Solis face solo would hesitate anymore than Umaga would to spike  his alss
Good job Jimmy
Jimmy just snappped
PAYBACK FROM HELL IN THE CELL OCTOBER 2020!!!!
Jimmy jaytwins bros tight they benknowineaxh other since day one   reigns what about solo
Royal Rumble 2023 - Sami betrays Roman (Now) NoC 2023 - Jimmy superkicks Roman 😠
Yo, that second kick.
From " I dont give a dam what the tribal chef say " - Jey Uso 2022  to " I AM the TRIBAL CHIEF! " - Jimmy Uso 2023
Good to story' WWE , yes roman loser crymore fans roman cheating 🤣🤣🤣
Finally 🙏🙏 we needed this and I’m so happy it was jimmy. Would love to see jey win the universal and jimmy or solo hold the US title that would be so nice
I watched that like 5l times Jimmy Jay fsmilybben lookingeamchother since born  Wlalsallwlays around each other bros beautiful mofo noway
Should've superkicked Haymen too
Good jimmy
Love the bloodline buy Roman had this coming
Hold this W WWe
Romans like: "My Dawg?"
There will be HUGE consequences! And HELL TO PAY THIS FRIDAY ON SMACKDOWN 😢
The “oh my god” is one of the best calls of all time
Thank you at last
THAT was Ucey :)
Que Bueno ya era tiempo que alguien le ponga un hasta Aqui al Patan ese de Regins
This is one of the best storyline ever
That scream tho…
We can all agree that the bloodline has officially dissolved
Well, I know you shouldn't bite the hand that feeds you, but Roman should've treated the ones he feed with more respect. He didn't do that & it came back right in his face.
so what🤷🏻‍♂️no usos by he’s side y’all forgetting Roman gots other family members wrestling in the independent industry only takes one call 📞🤙🏼😂… we the ones Uce ☝🏼💯
It’s about time haha
The slapping the hands, and the wannabe gangster talk has turned me off with this angle. They are millionaires, not people from the street, stop talking like it.
It was 100% pure pleasure
Did he say “I got to” or “I gotchu “
This is one of those WTF MOMENTS and i love it and I knew everybody including myself knew that the usos was going to turn against their tribal chief their cousin Roman Regins
Is this the start of the faceturn or was that on smackdown?
Thats how its suppose to be 👏👏👏 That's how Usos should have done long time ago when they hv won the undiputed tag team champs.. and Jey shld have known this and help his twin bro make more chaotic stories aft that.. that will be a mark to remember in All of WWE History and GOAT UNDISPUTED TAG CHAMPS
Roman Reigns should’ve known better to put his hands on Jey. Jimmy wasn’t gonna stand there and watch his brother be abused!!!
It was 100% pure pleasure
Love you for that auperkicks Jimmy
I'm done watching WWE full of scripts now the end of the Roman reigns family in WWE lol 😮😮😊😊
Jimmy didn’t turn on Roman. Roman turned on The Bloodline.   Why doe he push Jey like that. That ain’t what family does
Goldberg gostou muito disso
Jimmy pulling the trigger first makes so much sense. He was never loyal to Roman. He did what he did because of his brother. That first super kick was pure instinct. Someone abusing his brother took him over the edge. You can even see it on his face, like, "wtf did I just do" before snapping back, standing up for his brother, and showing he has Jey's back. Amazing.  Edit: I know 100 likes isn't much, but I don't think I've ever had a comment get this much attention 🤣
All of these guys (Roman,Jimmy,Jey, Sami and Paul) are great in ring and on the mic but they are really good actors. They have made this storyline seem so real. The little facial clues and things have made this seem more like a movie than any storyline I've ever seen in my years of watching WWE or WCW
Nahh family breakups ❤️ I’m with jimmy tho  Talofa  Lessh go uce Samoahhh all the way baby
I've been waiting for this for a long time
🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🥵🥵🥵
The shocker is when Jey finally kicks Roman in the face
The kick heard round the world
Loved every segment of it.  I love the tribal chief, and regardless of when and where it ends, I like the buildup to the end.
Jimmy: "I did it for The Rock."
Sorry but I can't get over how bad those "super" kicks look...
I GOTCHA U AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH: that scream was rage being let out …
CINEMA
Would've been so good if both them super kicked Roman the 2nd time!!
Could you imagine if roman drops the belts to the usos
Sami gonna be happy
Scénariste  MC Mahon
They don’t show it here, but after the kick, Jey was so torn. You could hear him trying to call out to Roman by his government name.
Thank You Jimmy!!!!!
I knew it! After the Sami Zayn saga, the bloodline has been a time bomb ticking
i think it was a terrible move for jimmy if i could spit on ya i would! family ain’t family if you gonna do roman like that
Jimmy as Universal Champion  Jey as WWE Champion
Oh
I loved every moment and every movement of those super kicks
That was hella dope!!! Wwe Merch Ts  “I got you!!”
I have Seen that coming
Still in 🤯
Oh.. my..  fkg Sami😠
👏🏾👏🏾
Some twist! 👏
Jimmy,those 2 SUPER kicks had to come from Samoa 🎉🎉🎉🎉and it felt jus sooooooooooo damn gooooooooooood
There's nothing like brotherly love, and I don't even have a twin, just an older brother.
the acting by everyone in the bloodline has been S tier
Nobody ask me how many times I've watched this because my answer is gonna change everytime
Dammmm
Finally.
Love what Jimmy said to Jey. "I got you" then proceeds to kick Roman again. I'm glad WWE went with Jimmy doing the kick. Sort of a little twist. Can't wait to see what's next!  Big Jimmy is here!!!!!
About damn time Good job bro💯💯💯
Make this into a movie. This is cinema
Yesssss
❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉😢KEEP RIZNN 2 DAHH THE TOP USO,GIVUUMM ALL YOU GOT,BACK ON THE TOP SHELF, THE DEN CHECKING IN 🎉🎉🎉😮😮😮
The you don't touch my brother type of relationship
I always thought it would be Jey but having it as Jimmy made it all that much sweeter. The road to RR dropping the belt begins here.....
FINALLY ugh. My house erupted over this. We were so sick of how Roman treats them.
You know jey wanted to do that for a while now
Long overdue
Hell yeah
WHAT DID HE DO?!?!??!?!
This is cinema
I love Jimmy ❤️
Wowow Jimmy I like it Roman is nothing out of uso bro 🤣
Goosebumps
Definitivamente es cine Thi is cinema
who's the tribal chief now?
That mother f**cker Jimmy got my respect
I literally jumped outta my seat after those moments. This story is getting freakin' intense now.
One of the best storylines in this era easily
Jimmy unleashed a samoan rage on Roman
I thought jey would pull the trigger
the fact that they are all actually related makes this soo much better imo
Is Jey going have to choice a side? Roman or Jimmy?
Ha bene ymmy e che cavolo mi è proprio piaciuto
Happy Jimmy finally got a backbone
FINALLY the Usos can stop interfering during Roman's 3 Title Defenses per year.......
From Romans stand point he was defending Solo. He looked up and saw the Usos Kicking their brother and that pissed him off.
Yes end of bloodline
One of the storylines in years since Austin was around honestly they've been on it over 3 yrs the build up suspense and breaking it's more to come I can see solo turning as well
I saw it live, had to just come drop a like and watch it again
Jimmy was like - the first kick was for me. The second kick was for my brother. What crazy is Jimmy is the one portrayed as the calm one. When the calm ones snap on you, you deserve it.
Jey calling Roman by his real name made this so much more real! LOVED THIS!
That's what I was waiting for!
Bloodline......Flatline.....About time! This was awesome to watch! One of the greatest faction splits imo of all time!! The story was laid out perfect
The “I GOT YOU” and super kick were AMAZING
Jimmy becomes new unified champion in the future
Jimmy stood up to the bully for him and his twin.
The sad part that lead up to this was that Sami Zayn noticed it and it came to light from that point to this.
Jimmy had to ROAR at the end, all that abuse just exploded raw. RaW is WaR
Ask Roman reigns I’m coming up to him for his universal championship in the tables match
That pop wouldve been a lot louder if it was in the US
I can't stop watching this! Finally!
Sami was right all a long
Can’t stop watching this. My least favorite member of the Shield.
I can’t stop watching this. Simply awesome!
Finally some love for Jimmy Uso!!!
cinema
The story is gonna play out with Jey uso ending Roman. Its only right because he was the first one to have a rivalry with Roman. They were brainwashed by roman. Sami made Jey the bullying in Roman. Jimmy made him realize the disloyal in Roman. Solo is gonna leave off of Roman either disrespecting him or physical contact with him and we know Solo wont take that.  That's ll leave jey to finish the bloodline story since it started off with him.
HE JUST SLEPT ROMAN REIGNS....
CINEMA🍿🔥👌🏽
The Bloodline storyline, one of the best ever.
Awesome Jimmy!!!
No one has ever seen this side of Jimmy.
I'm doing what YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE A LONG TIME AGO! it means 3 long year ago when Jay want to beat Roman for the universal title.
It's About Time
If this happens in puerto rico. I dont know if i can hear the commentator.
Imagine Jimmy dethrones Roman
And we thought Jey and Sami were the vital ones to this story  Jimmy Uso said “hold my beer” 😭😭
Paul heymans face is just priceless. He really sells the shock and disbelief.
It was along time coming they are twins they have a bond that can't be broken even there are arguments between them. Roman destroyed this on his own Ko or Sammy Zayn had nothing to do with this. Solo choose a side.
I have been watching wrestling for over two decades and this one moment was by far the best moment I have seen. Props to WWE creative (and to the Bloodline) for pulling it off.
This was crazy good. Emotional. And that scream after the kick? Brooooo
Damn! The bloodline drama keeps getting better and better. First the Same betrayal and now Jimmy. Can't wait for Raw Monday
This has been a movie from start to finish & it’s only progressing on even more & more better & better ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ outstanding work by all involved 👍👌🤝
Being 22 years old I never make sounds watching wwe now but last night I actually screamed when this happened😂😂
There you go Jimmy Uce❤
I want Jimmy's boot whooooof Should be kept by WWE as treasured item😂
I dont get why it was jimmy when it was jeys loyalty questioned but im all for the piece of 💩getting what was coming🤣👏👏👏
You know the last 3 or so years has really probably not been good for Jey's mental health, when you think about it.
That was amazing story telling!
Only thing that could top this all off is Jimmy ending romans title rein, that's what should happen but prolly won't
Just whao!
Wwe is coming back
Jey : You can do Better than this..!  Jimmy :*kicks Roman second time even harder...*
electrifying moment 🥲
THE BLOODLINE RUNS DRY
Roman vs Jimmy at mitb, roman vs jey at Summerslam then possibly roman vs solo at survivor series a year on from the bloodline standing tall in war games
I could watch this all day. I hate roman reigns.
Men bilgandim kotgandim shunaqa bolishini
Jimmy scream means that was a breath of fresh air and it felt damn good to finally put an end to this torture 😂🤣
Was an accident
Finally!!!🙌
FINALLY THEY WAKE UP, I GOT CHILLS SEEEN THAT KICK, BUT THE SECOND ONE WAS JUST EXPECTACULAR
Now its just a matter if Roman is going to acknowledge that he lost the match,  or blame Solo so it'll be Solo and the Usos against Roman 😏
The ending is coming and it's going to be great.
Nooooooooo 😢
well done jimmy you just got big balls i salute you
Paul Heyman INCOMPETENCE on FULL display for ALL to see!
Meh. Roman has been given his 1,000 day reign, and predictably, they're moving on from it. Only 900 days too late.
Every time I think I am going to tap out on the stupid Bloodline story something like Jimmy Uso being the one to snap happens and it draws me back in.   I am glad they finally pulled the trigger.  They were running out of reasons not to.
The shield
RIP Bloodline. 2021-2023.
Long over due USO!!
This is the start of the bloodline breaking up
The “ I Got You” was perfect!!
I want jimmy vs roman inside hell in a cell !!!!!!!!!! 😠 😡
Roman always got Betrayed , from Seth Rollins to Sami Zayn , now Jimmy USO
Jimmy always stood up to Roman Reigns
Yes finally!!! That's what roman gets ......they getting tired of him
Jimmy and jey gonna turn on eat other
Every faction eventually turns on its leader. Nash turned on Hollywood Hogan & formed the nWo Wolfpack, Evolution turned on Triple H with the thumbs down segment "👍👎" and now this.
I like how Jimmy looks like he committed murder, just like rikishi running over stone cold😅
This match happened as I imagined,  Finally!!! Thank you Jimmy ☝️☝️☝️
You go Jimbo!
Best WWE story
I thought jey was gonna be the one to snap
Shuu
Boringg. There go the Usos. Buried. Thank God cody and Aj are coming back to AEW. Bring the usos w you, they cant get a w to save their lives
I thought J was gonna come to his senses and  deliver the second kick all in all Top Tier
FINALLLLYYYYYYY
Started as cousin versus cousin then got each other's backs to forming as family to winning championships to sammi in the trenches of the bloodline an the bloodline having cracks of their own because sami was their probably to Finally Jimmy has had enough of the bullying from roman an stepped up to defend jey
I love it because yah their family but you dont mess with his brother 😊
I’ll say it, this is arguably the best story WWE has ever told. And I mean the entirety of the Bloodline. From the start with Jey vs Roman to now.
I am so shock about jimmy uso just superkick
Lets gooooooo!
The uses ☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼
RIP Bloodline
Jimmy shut him up omg 😳 lol
Концовку можно смотреть бесконечно
Then now and forever 😂😂
Nobody's b*tch as he said two years ago
Main event Jimmy 🥰
Bro jimmy telling Jay "I GOT YOU" then kicking roman in the head again is one of the greatest moments of all time
They played Jimmy too well. He kept his emotions close to his chest this entire time, and he just EXPLODED. PHENOMENAL.
“I Gotchu” - Jimmy Uso
You f… up uce ! Whyyyy !? THIS IS FAMILY UCE ! Noooooooo ! 😢  I hope our Tribal Chief is gonna whoop your a** Uce ! You're gonna learn who the Tribal Chief is ! ☝🏼🩸
This was so worth it
Even knowing it was coming, this was the BEST moment in a long long time! Well played WWE, well played.
Literally the best moment of the whole show 😂
a strong PPV .... HHH must maintain creative control ... it has been a good couple of years in WWE
Jimmy uso did the right thing
You deserve it 😂😂😂
This was incredible
I'm just conflicted over who I want to dethrone Reigns, take the titles, Sami, Jimmy, Jey, Cody or Solo
So Jey is just some hapless little punk who won't stand up floor himself lol
"I'M DOING WHAT YOU SHOULD OF DONE A LONG TIME AGO, I GOTCHU!"
Oscar Worthy Storytelling 👏
This is a movie, incredible
This was long overdue because the storyline was getting old.  Finally, the eventual happened.  Sooner or later, and hopefully sooner, the Bloodline breaks up.  Good riddance!
I can hear Tony Khan crying now 😭
The Usos and Bloodline are saving SmackDown. I haven't been this excited in years!
People been hyping over main event jey uso.but jimmys just as good! Doing what any big bro would do when they feel like they and their lil bro are being taken advantage of. Top tier promo from jimmy
WWE you are awesome
Mr. President, a second super kick was just hit. I repeat, our tribal chief just got hit with a second super kick 😢
If we don’t get an “I got you” t shirt I’m going to be very disappointed
😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 0:08 😂😢 Heyman Road done 0:15 When you thought it was the best you ever seen      😮Jimmy no.... 0:51😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
best storyline ever made in all sports entertainment
Jimmy knew that it was no turning back after the first superkick .... but damn im glad he pulled the trigger 🔥 and its only a matter of time before jey does too
Kevin Owens: “I’m looking at the heart of that table” just hits different now
He did the right thing I was sick of him treating them the way he was
"Im doing,what you should have done along time ago. Aaahhhhhh!!!!"
❤ hello Jimmy, 🎉 you are standing and stepping up!!!! 😅 Jimmy you are great!!!!
The usos deserve it 😂❤
Roman need to Jimmy back in his place, I had enough of him falling out of line.
Seeet about time WWE do something right now next week they will screw
Finally the Usos brothers when back to show the world who the Usos really are this is what I called the real Usos and I love it
Jimmy, if you see, I felt the pain behind them words uce, you did the right thing.
When Jimmy yelled I am doing what you should have done a long time ago at Jey I totally agreed with that statement
Splendid moment
Finally szczurline is going to the end
this was incredible. hows this though, wwe over here pushing jey and jimmy to main event status as a tag team! you got main event jey and the tribal uce jimmy ( sorry it cant be head of the usos lol.)
Big Brother Jimmy saying To his Little Twin Brother Jey  I Got You  The Usos are Loyalty to each other. I Love The Usos.
I also realized something roman dedicated that match to the wild Samoans *laughing* boy are they pissed off
Let's face it. People thought it would be Jey 😅 but can't wait for Roman to smash Jimmy and Jey to have enough jump Roman
And now it’s the tribal chief the wise man and the enforcer ☝️☝️☝️🔥🔥🔥 that whole thing with Roman yelling “ SOLOOOOO!!!!” I saw it coming that Roman would give solo his push in wwe
That right jimmy send this piece of trash to lala land
Literal chills
And here, I thought Jey was gonna be that guy. Well, either or, it was BOUND to happen. Thank you, Jimmy!
Seems like jey would've done the same thing. ANYWAYS Congrats to MY Tribal chief 1000Day Title Reign.
Pure definition of a Brother!! This was good!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
WWE DID THE BEST DISICION TO COLLAPSING BLOODLINE
Dasurv
He really said , "hey you can't do that"
This was literally 23 hours ago and I still can’t believe this actually happened
the look in Jimmy's eyes I never saw him this angry uce 👀👀👀👀
Jimmy was right for super kicking roman twice Jey was in shock Jimmy will talk to Jey and he'll be alright uce 💯💯💯
It's about dam time uso
Jimmy I'm proud of you I knew this was going to happen I wasn't sure which brother it was that was going to do it
WWE bad I don't want you, I don't like you, thumbs down 👎🏼💔😭😢
I’ve watched this 10 times already the excitement from it never gets old
Jimmy better than Roman now jimmy now on heel😡 rn
I’m glad this moment finally happened I’ve watched this clip so many times..Putting my ones up for Jimmy☝️
This is beautifull
We all Thank Jimmy for finally Ending the Bloodline!! I can’t wait for Raw
Whatever y’all keep doing with this storyline and whoever started this, y’all back there need to take notes and work this style into the REST of the stories. This has been phenomenal.
2 super kicks from Jimmy was enough to make me forget about all of the other matches.
Roman is going to ask Jey to handle Jimmy in front of the bloodline. To show his loyalty. Jey is starting to look like a coward right now. But he won't touch his brother. It's coming. The reaction will be unbelievable. It might garner a pop that reminds me of stone cold.   That's how you know a story is being told right.
Roman forced their hand for 3 weeks. Jimmy had enough Uce 🎉 🦶 must see Tv Monday night .
is about time
Jimmy : acknowledge me
Solo and Roman vs The Usos next.
Yes 🎉🎉🎉
We knew this would happen, just didn't know when. Solo can still turn on Roman as well. I can see Jimmy vs Reigns for the Universal title and winning it.
Roman used jimmy to get jey to submit to him at start. So it works out
Roman Reigns and Jey USO and Jimmy USO, family what happened Problem why!! 💔😭😢😔
Trust WWE to somehow find a way to make Brock Lesnar the number contender out of this story 😂
Those two screams by Jimmy after that 2nd Superkick? Yo, I FELT THAT down in my soul!
Good. Now The Usos won't interfere anymore during Romans's matches to help him win
CINEMA 📽️🔥🔥💯
total annihilation
Jimmy finally did get his payback since that “I Quit” match when Roman choked him out
About time
Super kick heard round the world
The scream after the second kick was a relief he needed
The rush I got when Jimmy finally snapped and super kicked Roman. This is the greatest storyline in recent memory. Maybe a future feud between Roman and Jimmy will start
I’m glad Jimmy did it💯after sitting back and watching his brother get  manipulated by Roman for a whole year sitting at home, He knew what he had to do to protect his brother and that’s why I look up to Jimmy because he’s forever his Brothers keeper no matter the trials and tribulations they got put through Jimmy always had Jey’s back since he  cameback!!! It was only a matter of time before he cracked!
THE BLOODLINE 💔😭😢😔
FINALLY something different happening to the stale Bloodline storyline! I really hope they don't screw this up and make the USOs apologize and act like everything is good again..
Damn, after all this time, this was how he truly felt. The emotion that this man felt that was hindering in his heart. Shoot, I would have felt the same way if someone had done the same thing to someone close to me. The storyline, the drama, how everything was choreographed was perfect for the last couple years.
Jimmy be like : no one touches my bro 😒
I Cannot believe WWE pass on Jacob Fatu man is beast like Umaga same with Alex Hammerstone he look like a young  Brock Lesnar
Well there goes the bloodline
HUUUUGE POP
Il était tant que roman connaisse le vrai visage de ses neveux 😅😅😅
Amazing.
Shoulda happened in montreal and have Sami win the title. Imagine the pandemonium.
This was wildly satisfying,I hate Roman Reign’s character
Jey should of super kicked Roman too.
Best thing I ve seen in this now a days wrestling 😂
Finally!!!!
finally, finally pass
:17 those wild Samoan eyes on Jimmy
We all knew this was coming it all started with Jey Oso and when he didn't win  the I quit match. Against Roman Reigns he started winning all his matches with his cousin's Jimmy and Jey Oso by his side. And this is where the bloodline come from and sense the I quit match Roman Reigns been calling himself the Tribal Chef and wanted everybody to acknowledge him. Then Paul Heyman started kissing his butt like he did with Brock Lesnar and then Sami Zayn betrayed his friendship with Kevin Owens. By joining the Bloodline along with Jimmy and Jey Oso brother Solo Sakura. Which made the Bloodline tighter and more dangerous than ever. Winning non-stop matches but it all came crashing down cause Roman Reigns starting bossing his cousin's around plus Sami Zayn. But Sami Zayn was the first one to Break from the group. Cause he got fed up with his abusive power and that what caused the Oso's to lose the tag team belt's at WrestleMania 39. Against Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn but he was the first one to predict that they would lose the tag team belt's they did. Then Cody Rhodes said everybody's gonna leave Roman Reigns starting with Jimmy and Jey Oso and they did at Night Of Champions cause his abusive power was to much. Now we have Monday Night Raw on Monday. I'm happy this happened cause they didn't need Roman Reigns anyway and Roman Reigns didn't need them either.
Loved every moment of this
Jimmy never wanted to be part of this alliance in the first place, he was eventually convinced by Jey. Can't wait to see what happens next.
YOOOOOOOOO WE SAY IT COMINNNNNNN
Wow!!! This feels like good wwe from when it was actually good!!!
The Usos are future Hall of Famers without a doubt .
Is is just me or did anyone else hear Jey say “We gotta do better than that?” Could he have meant the turn was meant to be better but Jimmy pulled the trigger early? Maybe they had a plan already 🤔 0:31
😂😂😂 Roman  Reigns  fan  are crying  all night  last night  😂😂😂
I know the story isn’t over yet but I sure will miss The Bloodline.
FINALLY THE BLOODLINE IS OVER! THE TRIAL CHIEF JIMMY USO!☝️
History will repeat itself. Jimmy Will experience of what Jay went through with Roman.
😂😂😂❤❤❤🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
my god the years of frustration let out in one moment. The wild eyes. The bond between two brothers.
I'd guess Roman's gonna destroy Jimmy which will lead to a Jey vs Roman feud
When the oldest sibling had enough of the parents bs:
The SuperKick of all super kicks!
When Roman and solo retaliate I guaranteed it’s going up this 1 love jimmy
Jimmy dont give a damn anymore. He had enough of Roman's abuse and controlling behavior. It maybe a suicide mission, but he's not gonna stand around and let his brother get shoved. The warnings from Sami about Roman, sunk in his head.
Championship match jimmy vs Roman
I honestly thought we were going to see jimmy vs jey for a second
The facials here…Paul. Jey. Roman. But Jimmy though… 💰💰💰💰. Incredible
This is GOOD, and I’m really hoping this all leads to an incredible, electrical reunion with THE SHEILD!! The WAR TO END ALL WARS - THE SHEILD VS. THE USO’s
That guttural, primal scream after the 2nd superkick 🥰
"i got you!" Badass line
I would kick my cousin upside the head too if i got that treatment.
“I got you”😢
YAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSS UCE!!
I am disappointed in Jimmy uso
This almost competes with the shield betrayal
After Shawn's kick on Shelton, now this is one of my favourite kicks just for the moment and the context.
I hope we get Jimmy vs Roman next
Jimmy is the ONE!!☝️🤨 About time!!
THE POP!!!
The swerve was great, thought Jay would have been the one to pull the trigger
BOOKING OF THE YEAR!!!
Jimmy’s screams after the second super kick, you can feel and hear all that rage that was building up inside of him.  Amazing storyline by WWE, kind of makes me wonder what WWE has in store next after all this is done with.
The shield regresara
Making Jimmy the one who pulled the trigger instead of Jey is nice decision Jimmy has been in passenger seat this whole time. he basically just background character during Jey and Sami conflict and now he take the driver seat and become more relevant. jimmy deserved to be in the spotlight just as much as Jey
This is the best thing that happened at night of champion 😂😂😂😂 those super kicks was A class
Roman's face rolling out of the ring he can't believe it
The worst part in all of this is that we have to wait 6 days from night of champions to smackdown for the next part
It’s jimmy realizing that Jey was right all along and they should’ve betrayed Roman a long time ago. That’s why he says “I got you” like he understands now
When he kicked him while he was down my jaw literally dropped lmfaoooooo
As much as the Bloodline has been about Roman it has been equally about Jey Uso
sitdown roman reigns
FINALLY!!!
i was in tears💀
Slammy awards Most Shocking Moment i calling it early
Even if it's the colllpase of the Bloodline ,Thank You The Bloodline for making me Watch WWE
Hope solo don't sour on his bros, hopefully he spikes roman for not helping him.
USA should take notes on how to react to the shows:  ✅Cardiff, Whales ✅Montreal Quebec, Canada ✅San Juan, Puerto Rico ✅Jeddah, KSA   And i know London will not disappoint for Money in the Bank 2023
I want jimmy to win the undisputed belts now
I dont even watch wrestling anymore but this was amazing
The first one was reactionary, the whole "get the F out of my brother's face" thing. That second one was completely meant.
The Bloodline story continues to get better and better!
Now that this went down, it’s gonna be Jimmy vs Roman for the title at summerslam and jimmy’s gonna beat him. What’s better then one of ur own taking the title from the man that’s held it for over 3 years? Say what u want about Roman. This is the best storyline in the modern era of wrestling.
To be honest they were winning the titles for Roman not for themselves. In a storyline sense
I thought jey was gone get a kick in after he said you gotta do better. But they best story line tho
The Bloodline had collapsed
Roman had the bloodline. He had a foundation. Now his foundation has fallen at his feet just like the Shield did
💔i bought nearly shredded a tear
"I got you"
Who needs main event Jey Uso when we can have main event Jimmy Uso. I like where this is heading
Never thought it would be Jimmy to turn thought it would be jey
That “ i got you”…had so much brotherly love behind it
No WWE this isn’t the 200th time I’m watching this what do you mean? 🤥
Jimmy Uso Is Like Ive Had Enough! Its OVER!
I like it 😂
Jimmy Uso pulling the trigger on Roman x2
Paul shocked 😂
Jimmy looking angrily at Roman wow.
The super kick was the only good thing bout this match
Jimmy uso like that was long overdue .
Omg poor jey .
I knew only a matter of time Jimmy USO is gonna snap.
I like  that  Finally Usos come to the realisation
Roman allone îs so weak even în woman champions he wil never win nothing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Such a good twist. We all thought it would be jey but nope, Jimmy
Jey a straight punk 😂
Yeassssss jey a punk
Oh my god this is top tier.
The best part about this clip was how well Roman sold that Super Kick! That man slid out that ring like hot butter😅😅
Bless you Jimmy
This was my favorite part of the pay per view  I love Paul's reaction to this lol
Best moment in the usos carrer
Paul Heyman reaction was PRICELESS
I think it's the sign that the Rock could return to WWE
Again and again it's a waste to break a team like this they have all for them and now, it's maybe a classic yet but always see betrayal in every team it's kinda annoying, and in the Bloodline?? Bruh they were the best thing in WWe
This could all be a swerved though, to make people think the BL is done anything possible in WWE. But for now I'm liking it believe that 😂
Time to end the Chief
Congratulations to Jimmy Uso, I've been waiting for this for so long,Roman Reigns has manipulated their mind❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Thank you so much ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤No Usos no Roman Reigns❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ good bye the big dog❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
About Damn Time
F him up!!
I like where this is headed, my question is where Solo goes with this. Does he stick with Roman or follow his brothers. My gut says he goes with his brothers but WWE has always swerved when they should go straight so..... Yeah I am expecting to be shocked by Solo's decision to leave or stay.
Please Jimmy VS reigns match. I want reigns finish his causin 👊👊
Best story line since stone cold Vince McMahon
Thank you Jimmy Uso for this epic moment love you great time watching Jimmy Uso attack Roman Reigns 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This storyline alone is getting everyone involved into the half of fame.   Watch 10-15 years from now when they talk about the early 2020s for WWE it’ll be all about the bloodline story.   A legacy is being created right in front of our eyes and this is a true “what a time to be a live” moment in WWE story storytelling.  This is WWE's redemption ark after years of fans criticizing them.
you have betrayed your entire Samoan family and made a stupid mistake, Sami has manipulated you, feel like he is your brother
Most overrated champion ever its annoying at this point how he only has won every match with help from usos or solo
What would’ve made it even better was having Roman get up and third time and then Jimmy ready to do it a third time and hesitates, looks at Jey and then Jey says F it and they both super kick Roman together.
I hate WWE but I got to say this the best storyline ever, even it's a stolen one, but nevertheless I really enjoyed that kick to the face.
WWE BOOKED THIS REAL GOOD
Jey's concerned  face was brilliant
The Usos are "The Ones" ☝️☝️☝️
This was amazing!!! It was totally unexpected and I felt every emotion coming from each character. Now it's time to get Solo involved. Possible scenario could be onSmackdown Roman doesn't acknowledge his loss and say that Solo lost and not him.
I’ve been replaying this since yesterday and I have not gotten tired of it watching 1000 times lol
That was awesome
I haven't watched wrestling since 2006. Because it was getting goofy af and i was tired of HHH having a boring reign. But this storyline got me fully invested again
The Bloodline gotta be nominated for an Oscar and Emmy after this
Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens won a prize greater than not only the tag team championship, but also greater then the Undisputed Universal Championship….. they have officially destroyed the bloodline
The 2nd superkick gave such a no regrets, no turning back feel to this. The 1st superkick may have been spur of the moment, the 2nd superkick was the release of everything pent up over the last few years
Seriously jey like really
Roman Reigns & Solo Sikoa blew their opportunity to become the new Undisputed WWE Tag Team champions because they're not the ones, they are the zeros.
This is awesome
This was bound to happen in the end as we all knew. It just took a while for the bloodline to turn heel on Roman Reigns 😅
I got you!!!
That time is coming up
They gonna drop a interview like they daddy 😂 I did it for the rock  I did it for the the people 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You gotta love jimmy
Love it😂
Hopefully This story line will be in wwe 2k24
Yes, yes! Way to go Jimmy.
He should have done this long time ago! 😅
SHOULDA kicked out a couple his damn teeth
I'm just sad that I have to wait a week for more. This bloodline story has been the most amazing thing to come out out of WWE for a very long time and it shows no signs of slowing down.
If WWE can put this much effort into this story, why can't they create more compelling and deeper stories involving other wrestlers?
Maybe HHH did the right thing at WrestleMania
yesssss jimmy u did it u stand up for u and your bro
Its about time.....good for jimmy
It's about time fr nice job Jimmy
I have a twin brother! ❤I 🎉definitely get it, lol 😮
First Sami Zayn and now Jimmy?
The best storylines yet !
Peep Paul Heyman in the back being the GOAT of facial expressions
Let us not forget that he did it for the rock
It’s about time this head of the table was gett’n old n gett’n on my nerves
R.I.P Bloodline
"I AM THE TRIBAL CHIEF!!!!"  ~Jimmy Uso.
This is what happens when Vince isn’t in charge of storylines 😊
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Can't believe what happened with the Tribal Chief tonight... like absolutely nobody expected THE Tribal Chief to superkick Roman Reigns.
Yess the usos deserved
The way I jumped from my chair and screamed should be studied. The shock, the excitement, the devastation, the relief. Man, I had so many emotions running through my body that I can't even comprehend them all. Jimmy's anger, frustration, and resolution. Jey’s confusion, distress, and concern. Jey screaming “JOE!” as he and Jimmy are leaving. Roman’s palpable devastation at everything Sami and KO saying came to fruition and the loss of not only his cousins but the match he dedicated to his father. Omg. CINEMA AT ITS FINEST. These gentlemen need an Oscar.
Paul Heyman's expression when jimmy super kicked roman was priceless 😂😂😂
Give roman the credit he deserves,he sold that second kick flawlessly.
this shoulda happened long ago.. roman reigns is a bully to his cousins
Finally Roman got what he deserved
The Bloodline and his members are the best storyteller's in the last 20 years of WWE, quite possibly the best storyteller's of all time, everybody who's booing Roman now, will miss him a hell when he leaves, and its sad think that this can be happen sonner.
I WANNA START A GROUP WITH MY BROTHER CALLED THE JEWSOS. WE'D BE JUST LIKE THE USOS, BUT YOU KNOW.......JEWS. SHALOM
Jey will be the last to turn on Roman because he is loyal.
WOW!
Don't kill me but we could see an NWO black and white vs NWO wolfpac situation here
Bro jey got his solo run, now its jimmys turn
Big brother finally protected baby bro
Omg 😳! Jimmy USO Needs to turn face
When Jimmy says I got you and then kicks Roman again👌👌
Ungrateful judas!!!!
When he pushed jey then he said I got you then superkicked roman made it better
I feel so bad for Jey, 3 times now his heart has been broken within family. First when Roman and him fought back in 2020, then Sami, Now jimmy having to deal with roman.
roman deserves it.
Heyman’s faces when roman got superkicked😂😂
Bro that scream came from the Pit of Jimmy soul
I just want a clip of only Paul hey man’s facials that alone is gold
bloodline story started with Roman vs Jey and gonna end with roman vs Jimmy
Jimmy Uso Gave His Superkick To Roman Reigns And The Fans Are In Loving It Huge Reaction
I'm glad it was Jimmy to be the one to finally betray Roman. The focus was so much on Jey to do it
id actually be happy if solo join the usos and leave roman he is now annoying and bossy
yes jimmy u did good roman cant just control and bully yall like tht  roman now the bloodline is nothing without u 🤣😁
""The mad titan had to be put down""
THIS IS CINEMA, hand them their emmy/ oscar...everything RIGHT NOW!!!!
Jimmy is the one who stuck up for Jey in 2020. We’ve come full circle.
Great job Jimmy try and team with jey,sami and ko
Welcome to the penitentiary
The next thing that happens roman thought that jey was jimmy and he superman punced him
Cool 👍🏾
I  though he said to Jey "I got you" but now realised that it actually "i got TO". Makes more sense for Jimmy to say so.
"I GOT YOU."
This moment is so incredible! Jimmy deserves some credit for his facial expressions as well because honestly he had a top tier performance. I'm so excited for Smackdown now.
The "i got you"  The 2nd kick 0:52  The scream   I felt that
Roman: there ain't no Day One no more! You understand me?? Get out of my ring!! (Pushes Jey's face) (Jimmy superkicks Roman) Jey: what you doing man?? Why you do that?? Hey you cant do that, ya hear me?? We gotta be better than that! (Fans chanting "One more time!! One more time!!") Jimmy: listen to me! Hey listen to me Uce! Im doing what you should have done a long time ago! (Proceeds to kick Roman's face and send him rolling out of the ring) Jey: okay, now I get what he means Jimmy screaming happily like a mad dog
Finally yeses you go Jimmy!!
"I GOT YOU" loved that
That reaction was amazing in saudi but nothing beats the San Antonio reaction when sami zayn hit roman with the chair
I think Jimmy should end Romans championship run
Now imagine going forward jey sided with Roman still and Jimmy had to get help from zayne and ko to snap him out of it causing a 3 on 3 Match
I gotchu!❤
I don't say this much...  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
😃😃😃
Jimmy should have kicked roman reigns along time ago sorry roman reigns fans but he has to go
The crowd reaction is the best, I was screaming on top of my lungs when it happened😱🤯
Roman reigns really acknowledge that superkick. 😂😂Lol
I have watched this like 50 times 😂 25% speed on that kick is a beautiful thing! Horse face is going DOWN!
Thank You Jimmy !!! Acknowledge JIMMY ! ❤❤
Roman has been mistreating his cousins for far too long. He needs some discipline
Welcome to the Uso penitentiary
BOUT TIME!!!
Just what I have hoped for happened f you roman
I just love how much of a view spike this has compared to the other stuff
I was so worried he’d regret doing it but then he hit that second kick and screamed 😮. What a moment.
Yes I love to see it no more Bloodline 😭‼️
Woso
So usos v/s reigns and solo will be on the card next
🎉🎉💪👍🙂
I like how every member of the bloodline has the moment to shine and has a part to play in the storyline and that its not just about Roman. I don't foresee the bloodline to just split from here, there can be much more storyline development from here. And Solo Sikoa hasn't had his moment in the bloodline yet. I actually do not hope for the Bloodline to implode and split from here yet.
I hope this isn't the end of the bloodline😭
I gotcha u 😅😅😅😅😅😅
This was so satisfied ❤❤❤❤❤
The end of the bloodline is hear
I legit geared up at this
This kick made Jimmy face and freakin over
Thank You Jimmy
This was the best wrestling moment in years ngl
Jey:what are you doing                           Jimmy:something you should have done a long time ago
The loudest pop since Sami hit Roman with that chair.
The superkick heard around the world.
Wow just wow
Jimmy protecting his twin, his true brother!
The Primal Scream Of Jimmy USO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✔️
This was a good video from WWE wrestler 😮😮
A well told story man. This is rare in wrestling!
Finally Roman getting it
Jimmy with the famous Samoan Scream afterwards. Definitely want to see all 3 brothers destroy Roman
3 years in the making a true long term great storyline
Jimmy channeling his inner rikishi" i did it for jey" the bloodline did it again first sammy n jey at mania now jimmy crazy good
Romans down fall, I love it
About time 😅😅😅
The aftermath on Monday is going to be LIT
This made me emotional...This is story telling Worthy of an oscar 😣🌹
These super kicks were as satisfying as Sami hitting Roman with a steel chair.
Jimmy Uso has snapped and kicked Roman's face that Jey should've done  a long time ago. And thank GOD, Jimmy did it!
Jimmy wasn't cool with the disrespect too Jey at all
They going to mess around and get me back into wrestling. 😮😮😮
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG YESSSSS!!!!
Holy moly 😮😮😮
Himmy USO took care of business 🫡
Himmy USO 😤
Been waiting for this moment. Finally,  Roman got what he  deserved
You cannot let your own family members disrespect you family or not!!!💯
W Jimmy uso
Jimmy you did the right thing💪🏾💪🏾
Pure Cinema.
Oh my god.....
Their ancestors heard that War Cry after the second kick.
The tribal chief deserved this from Jimmy. You can't disrespect old men like he did with these guys
Watched it 10X still loves it
Roman deserved it, he should see it coming 😊
THANK YOU JIMMY❤
Thats low even fir jimmy..kick him from behind..coward
instant classic, I've already watched it at least 5 times
Riskishi is so proud
Roman Reigns deserved that after the way he had treated the Usos
Two super kicks for the price of one Roman reigns aka tribal chief got a deal right there lol😂
If everyone remembers Jimmy in the beginning didn't like what Roman was doing with jey & everything else he was doing so comes back full circle to how he was feeling all along standing up for himself and his brother to Roman
Amazing
Definitivamente, esto es cine 🚬
Like why would roman just sit there and take another kick when he was clearly conscience?😅 he should of blocked the 2nd one and then went to attack dude and then uso brother rekick him..
Idk why that second kick, was so chefs kiss. But God damn was this perfect cinema. Top marks wwe, top marks.
“GET OUT OF MY RING” 😂😂
congratulations 👏 jimmy don't let it go roman reigns if jay wants to stay on his grip that's his problem roman reigns has no respect for you this puppet
It should make sense that Jey should dethrone Roman. Believe that! The Usos are about to become bigger than ever.  Down since day one ish is a code for real.
Now jimmy knows that sami is true roman is a manipulator
Yo what am I waking up to? Got to love wrestling!!!
So much acting in Saudia Arabia 😂
I been waiting on this 😂😂
I felt madness when I shouted Jay ............
The faster you realize that all this was Roman's plan,the better.. Usos never betrayed Roman
When this happened I gasped so hard and all I can say was JIMMY!!! Lol Love this storyline so much!!!!!
I've never reacted EVER how I did after that first superkick last night. The audible gasp made my wife ask if I was OK 😅 Felt like such a long time coming after seeing this begin behind closed doors in 2020 and now seeing it play out at it's peak is exactly what the product needs, emotion, raw emotion and nobody would have thought 10 years ago that it'd be the USO's who would bring such emotion and you certainly wouldn't have had Roman as such a dynamic, key piece of the puzzle back in his hound dog Babyface days! Bravo to all involved and to WWE for real long term storytelling. Now to have Solo pick a side and watch it all implode and for Cody to cash in at SummerSlam 😂😂🎉
If anyone can take down Roman reigns it's gonna be solo
The more this goes on, the more it’s clear this is Jey’s story
👏👏👏👏👏 Bout time
Hope Jey stays with Jimmy and doesn't betray him for Roman
I love Jimmy, Roman treats them like trash
WWE NEEDS to win an award for the bloodline storyline. Hollywood give WWE an award. Actually give everyone in the bloodline an award too for their acting. Best storyline in decade!!!
DON'T EVER COME AT MY BROTHER. 🔥🔥😆
"I got you"😢
YESS FINALLYYY !!
I knew jimmy would be the next one to snap on Roman because jey to weak
Roman used Jimmy to make Jet say I quit and feel trapped so he freed him Jimmy kicked Sami after he betrayed them just when Jey had opened up to him And again he kicked Roman when got in Jeys face and said they ain’t no more day ones
It might just be me but when I watched it live, the pop from the crowd wasn’t nearly that loud
0:43
Finally the bomb exploded
It was so nice he had to do it twice 😁
Jimmy is right jey u should've done a long time
Enough is enough after 2 years we all wanted this 🙄
Jimmy uso tired of roman just like us its painful😢 watching him bully his cousins man 😅😢
the greatest angle in pro wrestling today and it's not even close.
🫵😆🖕😂 Ha Ha Sucker's The Bad Man
와!!! 지미 넌나의영웅이야!
Absolutely amazing
Watch WWE blow it by making this some "trick" so everyone thinks the Bloodline is falling apart but in actuality..."Theyve never been stronger."
This is pure Gold! ❤
Why would YHU do dat……. I wanted to do it but IKTR?
OHHHHHHH that was so sweet to see ! Finally Roman getting whooped like he deserves. Oooh yeah !
I am your brother not him. Taking Jey with him after kicking Roman and leaving Soloa back 😂
too little too late though
i guess the "head of the table" got dethroned lol
The Saudi crowd did not deserve something so good
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 THIS WAS CRAZY
This is a catastrophe🙈
The first kick was great but that quick build up to the second kick was GOLD. I GOT YOU
Crazy how Jey went from "Why you do that??" To "ok cool bro. I don't want smoke" 😂😂
The big brother standing up for the little brother. A big change from how the little brother was standing up for the bigger brother when Jey Superkicked Sami. It has all come full circle, and it was a beautiful moment to witness.
Best storyline in the past 2 years, writters really pulled this off.
bout time....i know its all a fake story, but in the story, bout time. this is the only thing i am following in the wwe.....and after its over, im done....
ROMAN REIGNS vs. JIMMY USO
The Bloodline still consists of Reigns, Sikoa, Heyman and Jey (for now). They haven't fully imploded. The Usos might go to war with the rest of them though
If Solo joins in on this betrayal and we get Roman Reigns vs Brock Lesnar one more time and this time the Usos and Solo cost him that championship, I will keep begging for AEW to move to Mondays.
End of tribal cheating chief hahaha
About time
Thank you Jimmy!
Paul Heyman has the best reactions to stuff.. his face when Jimmy kicked roman.. priceless
The Bloodline story is a masterpiece....how it all ends is anybodys guess, I would imagine The Rock has to be involved in some way when it all comes crashing down and Roman can ride off into semi-retirement.
Is this actually real
I love seeing Roman getting attacked for some reason.
Ι just cant stop rewatching this. Imagine how much i will rewatch his dethronement
One of the best moments of all time.
Cody was right about Jimmy leaving like Cody said a man without his family, A Roman with no more reigns,a chief without his tribe.
Finally 🎉🎉🎉
This is normal, they're one family 👪 👌😂
This is peak story line work right here
jimmy called himself the tribal chief knew this was coming lol
YESS
Pleasantly surprised by the Saudi crowd. They were into it. The first Crown Jewel I saw they were deader than JFK
I suspected what was gonna go down last night when I was watching, but wasn't sure if WWE would pull the trigger until I saw solo standing behind Sami and the usos getting ready for the double super kick. When I saw that I tensed up like " how bad is this gonna get with the time left?" LOL. Beautiful moment and the only real surprise for me was that it wasn't a double kick to Roman by both Jimmy and jey
Best part of wwe of the year 2023😂😂😂😂 I was waiting for this moment.
Jey: Am I not my brother's keeper? Jimmy: ... Yes, I am.  *Jimmy superkicks Roman*
Best storyline in wrestiling history, hands down! I can't wait to see the next SmackDown!!!!
I just wanna see rikishi have segment with Roman
Jimmy USO betrayed Roman!!!!
I haven't been this excited since the Stone Cold and Mick Foley Era
I haven’t sat down and watched a single episode of WWE since 2019 but I’m deeply invested in this story line on YouTube😭 really  thinking about coming back
thank you jimmy, roman reigns has been toturing the usos now its their turn to do that.💯
Amazing finish. Part of me was hoping they would 3D Roman but I get why they aren’t rushing Jey.
The layers of brotherly love and respect Jimmy showed was epic here. As the little brother, I can confirm this had me choked up. That “I GOT YOU!” Was perfect!
I think Roman and Jimmy should has a match.
Sami S tried to warn them and tell them what was going to happen but they didn't want to listen
About time paper chump roman lost again so weak
I feel for the Uso Brothers all the pain and the suffering that they had to go through and the way that Roman been treating them ain't right even your own family members will betray you when you least expect it
Yesssss
I wish it would've been Jey that turned but I admit  that Jimmy's acting was phenomenal. I love how tortured he sounds when he lets out that primal scream after the 2nd kick. Even the dialogue leading up to it..." I'm doing what YOU should've done! But it's ok, I'VE got you!!"
Long time coming
That cathardic scream after the second kick. Storytelling at its finest.
Jimmy uso is a dumb idiot
Here me out, This is WWE's Cell game Saga. Jey is Gohan and Jimmy is setup to be android 16
I feel so different about the usos now! This is great!
The bloodline twists are the best in all of wrestling today. I just wonder how long  can the Bloodline last now, the USOs were soo important to this group.
I have been waiting for this moment to happen
About time.
I got you 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jey should be the one to dethrone reigns
The Bloodline's divisive moments...
The end of bloodline hahaha
Bloodline Storyline is the best storyline going on & it keeps getting better.  It was excepted Uso's would unintentionally cost Roman & Solo but what happened next wasnt expected. Most of us felt Jey would be the first one to turn on Roman but it was Jimmy.  That is the end game for Jey to eventually turn & would be final part of Bloodline Storyline.  Still plenty of layers left
Seems like an extreme way to say "I'm not playing any more"....
"i whooped you then, i whoop you now" Jimmy having none of that...
He deserved to be kicked twas too much for Jimmy 😂😂
we all know Jimmy did what he had to do. This was the right thing
Jimmy finally freed Jey from Roman in this moment but I’m afraid Jey is going to show serious sign of Stockholm Syndrome in the coming weeks.
--empire topple by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That’s dead, forever --. Lol this quote is perfect for this situation
Corey graves saying jimmy what did you do , princess
Jimmy and Sami has done the one thing Jey should have done, hit Roman. Return to Main Event Jey so he can beat Roman to be the new Tribal Chief
I've seen this coming
Finally it happened!!!!!!
Bro my heart dropped in silent 😦
hell yeah!!!! 🤪
0:56 THE SCREAM OF AGONY & RAGE of Jimmy Uso
Foking Epic!
jimmy did it right because he was under so much pressure from roman reigns
This is what the WWE fans have been waiting  for. Not just the bloodline implosion but whole storyline was executed brilliantly. It’s things like this which gives many fans hope that WWE still cares about long term character building and storytelling
What a moment! Main Event JIMMY!
The story is so good
I wish I could put more than one like on this.
YEESSSSSS GODDAMNIT YESSSSS
I bet Roman STILL can't believe this! He's the one who pushed them one too many times, and finally got what was coming. With Jimmy's scream, it's like he's finally letting go of his aggression and anger that's been building in him all this time when Jey was playing peacemaker.
Bloodline crumbled finally
And you know stuff like this will continue.   Simply because Hunter gets the business and will find ways where the die hards go “yea I see where this goes”.  Then a full 180 switch
Bro that was headshot momment if ther ever was headshot momment in WWE
Roman sold the hell of that super kick
That shows you how much superkick  can mean, even though it`s called "overused". Maybe it is, but when it`s right place and right time - superkick still the GOAT move.
Lmfao!!!!😂😂😂😂
Thought I’d be his brother but still that was awesome
That first kick was for Jey. The second was absolutely for Jimmy. CHILLS when that boy screamed yo.
The best story in wrestling  continue 👏🏆🎉🎊🥇
I found it so dumb to make roman out to be a coward who throws away the uso after they secured his title every single time
First one was for Jimmy. The second was for Jey.
So is Jimmy heel or baby
Jimmy or jey should be the one to dethrone roman
It's about damn time this happened, Jimmy was right, Sami was right, Kevin was right, Roman was just using the Usos, Jey should have stood up and superkicked the taste right outta the Tribal Chief's mouth a long time ago.
What Jimmy did was the right thing to do he has had enough of Romans abuse over the past 3 years, Roman really bloody deserved IT.  I'm so glade jimmy kicked regains head off😁💯
Ayoyo apa sudah jadieyyy?😅
The scream he let out was nothing but pain💯
Its so freaking good to see Roman get a beating ! 🔥
Lol Jey is DayDay in Next Friday "You don't got to live here I do!!!" 😂😂😂
Would like to request bringing back the Samoan tribal version of Usos, that would be great. Then they could challenge for titles.
he got what he deserved!!!
Loved it 🔥 long time coming
I can see jemmy as the new undisputed champion soon
Had they done this PLE in the good ole US of A, the roof would've blown off!
Seeing that kick felt good
I hate roman on his greed and using usos to maintain his championship for all that long then betraying them and treating them with disrespect
I knew it! I can tell by the signs of confusion, betrayal, melodrama, and more. One thing, I have learned about twins they always stick together and have each other backs! Big time!
Romans needs to back off he is making kids legends...now hes fighting with sami and ko he should be fighting with drew and brock thats why seth will surpass him
Es cine señores
ABOUT DAMN TIME!!!!!!!!!
I'll tell what he did. He pulled the trigger 😈😈😈😈
Bout damn time
it's that scream afterwards from Jimmy, like he's finally free!
Jimmy uso turn heel on tribal chef Roman reigns
Roman deserved it
At this point jey backing roman up whilst his brother tries to stop the pain they both get put through by roman is genuinely annoying.
This is like a drama you’d see on HBO. Just a lot of beats to this as opposed to just good guy v bad guy. Bloodline saga is easily the most compelling story in wrestling this generation(or however long it’s been since Ruthless Aggression era ended)
Funny people were actually commenting how boring Sami and kos title reign is , what an awful awful take
knew it was over last night when jimmy called himself the tribal chief. wow wow wow.
I can't wait until the next Smack Down!
If someone made a 10 hour version of the superkicks alone, I'd watch it multiple times. The emotions these guys draw out of you is insane. Definitely one of the best storyline in years.
People who aren't surprised   👇
The bloodline story is just getting started
The bloodline wasn't suppos to end now. After this segment the bloodline is over 🩸☝🏾💔😭😭😭
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It good for roman
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Wow wow Jimmy... Best decision ever.
Wrong place wrong time, the pop would of been HUGE had it been in the states
Wwe forever. I dream to be part of the Creative industry. Here made in Uganda. Africa 🇺🇬🔥 or attend any wwe event. Someone to make a dream come true
The moment Jimmy became a hero, his roar was something else.
Joe Anoa'i can't sell to save his life
That 2nd super kick was weak af why the bend, should've really gone through
Finally
As awesome as this is we sacrificed big up in coming names like Cody and drew for uso vs Roman part 2 3 years only to end up exactly where it all begin so lets be real here where just recycling old storylines at this point there nice to relive but by no means impressive because it only proves why Roman should have lost these titles long ago by other names so this is double edged sword yes its nice to see but its just a rehash of something we already seen 🤦
OH Yeaaah
That in no way is acknowledging your tribal chief😂
It's funny how Roman forgets he has hit the 1000day mark all thanks to the Usos....yet he treats them like rubbish; khudos that kick should have been delivered 2yrs back👏👏
Roman 😂😂☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
When the kids are tired of the stepdad 😂
I was upset the Uso made My man upset but more mad when Jimmy kicked him in his face and cost him the match.
Bruh this story linens crazy !!!!! Stopped watching wwe like 9 years ago but I had to watch this story line caise this shiiiiii is crazy!!!!!
It Was Just Some Superkicks Nothing Special
One of the best storyliines so far, thumbs up to writers! Jimmy and Jey never disappoints, the way they deliver their characters is just flawless, especially their emotions. Thumbs up!
“I’m doing what you should’ve did a long time ago, I GOT TO” felt that on another level 💯
😡😡😡😡
😡😡🤗
I got you❤
Jey’s having flashbacks to the beating he took last time, what a compelling story.
Roman needs the usos they don't need him lol
I was hoping for this finally lol the usos I acknowledge you lol yay Jimmy do it again lol
Yes Jimmy, this is good,  You guys should have done this long time ago. Roman Reigns is too proud and enviouse.    At first I like Roman, but now 👎
He should have kicked him harder 😂
Oke time to bring Jey Main eventer come back
Jimmy Uso is finally stepping up for himself and he wants to go on his own...major respect
Goosebumps everywhere even rewatching this. The " I gotchu" line👌
Hilarious 😆
Paul Heyman's face when Jimmy Uso did what to Roman Reigns.  Night Nite Roman 😆🌙
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Is this storyline still going?
He's gonna regret that 😳
Pictures before a desaster
I knew jimmy was always the main uso he was the i e that should have faced Roman when him and jay did that match a few years ago. But that was so awesome to his brother I got you then kicks Roman toooo sweeet
Sami, Zayn and ko are trash
Usos vs. Reigns & Solo Sikoa at SummerSlam?
exactly what in the hell did i just watch?
Jey is shocked. Wow!
Nooo ending roman, finish him 😆more super kicks 😝😆
Brillant. Roman deserved it
The Superkick heard around the world Jimmy finally pulled the trigger. Now let's see if Jay will join his brother or stay with Roman?
First one was a reaction.  The second one was personal
It still sucks. Drew should have won in Cardiff! Sami should have won in Montreal! Cody should have won at Mania!  They fu**ed up for a Jimmy Uso vs Roman Reigns Feud! It's stupid
Throughout the build I called it that one of the usos would superkick Roman when the ref was down. That superkick just felt so good to watch.
Holy balls this is nuts.
That is sad😢
Watch hw Roman goes down😂😂💔💔
Very good
Seth Rollins smashed Roman Reigns with two chair shots Jimmy Uso smashed Roman Reigns with two superkicks
One more time❤❤ Love from Kenya 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
I just like it
Finally
What a feeling to be the man all around the world but on your very own island it mean nothing.. Roman, enjoy your 1000 days cause your time is up..
Sammy was right all along...... Roman was going to ruin the bloodline all on his own and look what happend? 😅 now going forward the story needs to be where does Solos loyalty lay? because I'm sure Roman will keep Solo around so he doesn't lose his title but the min he tries to abuse Solo is the same min that Roman has no one left to help him and he will lose the belt to someone like Cody later on down the road when Cody and Lesnar stop feuding
🥇☝🏼
That's some real brother's keeper type of move tho.
JIMMY NOOOOOO!
K.O and S.Z paid Jimmy 😂 can't no one beat the tribal chief
Roman is the boss
Up there with Batista putting HHH through the table
YES YES YES YES YES
That superkick gives me goosebumps
I can believe what Jimmy Uso does to the Tribal Chief...but then again it's been a long time hasn't it?
The Bloodline has exploded. We all knew it was happening eventually
Yeah, honey, this is what I've been waiting for
I've watched this more than 10 times today, tbh it's satisfying to watch Roman get wrecked like this 😂
I loved the whole show but this was probably the best moment of the whole night 🤩
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 my prayers finally happened Danko The Twins
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 my prayers finally happened Danko The Twins
That is awesome Jimmy uso turn on Roman Reign at night of champions
Thank u jimmy uso
A 3 year journey
Story telling on point.
JImmy should be the next wwe champion. With this he has now become the no.1 contender.
E finalmente uno dei fratelli USO che si e dimostrato vero uomo e ha capito di essere solo un schiavo di Roman che senza loro non e nessuno
It's been a very long time since wrestling gave me goosebumps like that!
Jimmy done a big mistake,He didn't think on his feet fast enough i promise you, you could tell after the 1st kick he regretted inside but the crowd made him feel he did the best thing ever, he wasn't there to betray Roman to begin with?This could break them or destroy them
Nobody has ever made more stars than Roman reigns. Made several people’s careers
I love this
Damn!!!!!!!
ROMAN REIGNS IS ONLY A DIESEL 2.0...... THE ORIGINAL IDEA FROM VINCE
I knew that Jimmy uso was going to superkick roman I could tell when roman pushed him in his face
About time usos did that
Betrayed by *Seth* Betrayed by *Samy* Betrayed by *his cousin* Who else 😂?
Wow it was Jimmy in the end
The end is nigh for the Bloodline
This is the start of bloodline's downfall
Bros forever
Goosebumps
All this started because the rock didn't show up and we got the trial of Sami zayn.
Its about time Jimmy did this, take that Roman
Seeing it live was so awesome
I never forget had me tears that year choking his brothers out an using them like puppets. Now I’m happy for these brothers to go on they own. Cause I have to say without it they can just set they own plans an forget Paul an Roman
My favorite face turn it was way overdue
When will wwe give up with storyline BS. Why is Roman still champion for? 🤦🏻‍♂️wwe is dumb
Roman reigns ❤❤❤❤❤☝️☝️☝️☝️
The Head of the table has been beheaded by Jimmy with that superkick 🤙
Why not Jey
this storyline is the best of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jimmy doing what him and jey should have done all along
Jimmy's scream was soo powerful he finally letting out that frustration
Ok back at the elimination chamber Roman was lucky that Jimmy didn't see him push Jey's Face
Pueh ati aku🤣🤣🤣
Sometime after the fall of the Bloodline, I’ve got a feeling that Jey Uso will turn on his twin. And whenever the WWE decides on it, the Usos feuding will be one of the MOST EPIC feuds in WWE modern history
Jimmy did that for Jey just like Rikishi did it for The Rock.
Jimmy said it himself. He should've done what Jey hasn't done. This was coming, but I just didn't expect it all to implode too soon.
The bloodline story is like the only entertaining story in wwe right now and I love this
Do the Usos apologise to Sami now and say he's right?
Jimmy take his pride and shove it straight to Roman's tribal posterior ☝️  He spits facts, he does what Jey should have done a long time ago. And frankly i was expecting Jey to be the detonator, so that's a great twist in the storyline.  Props to the 3 men.
The Usos finally realizing Roman Reigns is an absolute idiot about Damn time
that roar from Jimmy after second kick *chef's kiss*
I realized jimmy doesn't hesitate to superkick anyone first Sami now Roman
Sami is right jey should have just blasted him with that steel chair at elimination chamber
This is legit one of the greatest moments in wrestling history
Jimmy took out sami first and was the first to take out roman love it
I CANT FOOKEN WAIT FOR FRIDAY!!!
im proud with u jimmy,,,👏👏
I always thought it would be Jey to turn on Roman and attack him.
Roman deserve that kicked 😂😂😂
Enough to make a grown man cry😭
This is what I was looking for a years
I like it 😂😂. The end of bloodline
When the quiet one finally loses his patience and composure.   "I'm doing what you should've done a long time ago!"  Nicely written.
I feel like jey always trying not to laugh 😭
I loved it
Now we will see another chapter of the Bloodline. As Solo shifts from a background character into a main character into the story, how will he decide what to do. With the Tribal Chief or with his Uce?  Now, we ha e 4 main characters in this story. Love it.
The only thing wrong with this moment is that they didn't wait til MITB so I could have seen it live
DAMN!! Over 1 Million views in less than 12 hours 😳😳
I get that there’s a reason this didn’t happen at Wrestlemania but this is easily the loudest pop in Saudi and might’ve been one of the loudest of all time if it happened at Mania. Regardless, incredible to have watched this play out weekly
The end of an era
Jimmy protecting his little brother
Mah Gaad.... The made it seem so Personal 🔥🔥🔥 wwe storylines are so Extremely intense.... But Extraordinary 🔥
I love that ❤❤❤
Well it’s about time bloodline going sideways
I can understand why jimmy delivered multiple kicks to reigns. He was tired of the abuse
He did it for jey!! Rikishi and rock
Jimmy tells Jey "I'm gonna do what you should've done a long time ago!" even tho Jimmy stopped Jey from attacking Roman multiple times in the past.  This storytelling has been flawless so far, but I'm hoping this is just addressed soon.  Jimmy being the aggressor and Jey being the conflicted one seems to have occurred too randomly.
Finally! Classic WWE! This is what we all needed!
This is truly the ending of The Bloodline 🧔🏻🔴🔵🏆👬🏽🔴⚫⚪🧔🏽🛣🏆👨🏼‍💼☝🏼☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽👍🏽☝🏼🇼🇸🇺🇲 at Night of Champions 🌙🌎🌟⚫🏆🌃🏟🎆🇸🇦.
The best 2 thing that happened in wwe last night
I thought Jey USO was gonna do it
All I can say is that I swung my fist in the air when that superkick landed
I love WWE again. Roman is about to be The Rock Baby face now. Watch!
"I'm doing what you should have done, a long time ago. I got you"
good ~~~
That second superkick hit different.
Jey vs Jimmy at WrestleMania 41
"U should've done this a long damn time ago!"
Lot of people that watch him kick RR i bet don't know this but the USOS contract with WWE is up in early 2024 so this is the start of the end before they go
This was on of my favorite ppv's so far  epic!
Don't be surprised when one of the bloodline member wins money in the bank suitcase and cash in on main event of Jimmy vs Roman Reigns at the same night
Jimmy Uso has just become the most respected guy on the roster
*Sponsored by Nike*
I've been watching WWE since Hulk Hogan.  This, hands down, became the best storytelling in WWE history
Roman ihanet eden 3 kisi oldun jimmy sana yaziklar olsun, o sizi yucelti , sizi biyuttu , seth sami simdide jimyy hepiniz onu kiskandiniz , roman reigns o bir kraldir❤ o kaybetmez ama usolar kaybetti artik sizi kimse kesmez
I knew this three weeks in advance very obvious
Give it to Sami the Master of all manipulators, Jimmy should challenge Roma for the undisputed championship, sami and Owens should help him to win the belt
Finally!!!!
Best moment of a otherwise horrible event.
This was along time COMING!!!   ( AM DOING WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE A LONG TIME AGO) Preace it JIMMY!! THANK-YOU 😂🎉
Jimmy did the right thing to superkick roman
And then Jey is the next to superkick Roman on his 1000 days celebration
my jaw dropped fr
Finally!!! Absolutely Amazing!!!!  The Uso's way better off without Roman R.
About damn time
This was absolutely 💯% satisfying! The bloodline has officially crumbled!
Nice kick
I've always wanted to see Jimmy get a singles run like Jay did a while ago... He deserves it
About time!!
That was awesome j8mmy
Roman is gonna get Revage anyways
I love how the spotlight was on Jey and now it’s on Jimmy.
Im so proud of Jimmy USO.
This is how you end an fantastic PPV with an excellent storyline
Jimmy went rouge, and gave Roman a reminder not to mess with the Usos.
If WWE would let The Twins be this savage all the time the would be Untouchable. They would be The GOAT of Tag Teams.
I called this four  days  when I  said  the bloodline was coming to ended because I  know it was going to happen four days ago  it just  all hit the fan at night if champagne ended on pay view
1billion percent agree with Jimmy what he said to Jey😂
First time ever that I have cheered the Usos. This was great.
Boo
☝🏼🐐
UNBELIEVABLE!! I feel SOOOOOOOO USY!!! 😝😝😝
DO IT AGAIN! DO IT AGAIN!! *SUPERKICK HIM HARDER!!*
Roman just collapsed after the last super kick
Such a boring storyline
The push jimmy gave jey was so hard before tge last kick 🤣🤣
Best storyline since the Hart Family feuded in the 90’s!!!  Jimmy did the right thing but is gonna pay hard for it 🤔  Still getting goosebumps when Jimmy says: I’m doin’ what YOU should HAVE DONE a long time ago!! 😏
This is history right here
Shame this didn't happen in the states the pop would have been so much better.
I was watching Night of Champions thinking "omg, what".
Finally!!!!
Roman deserved it
This is the greatest Family Story ever Told, the Twists, the Emotions, the way it turned everyone involved into Legends & held the WWE for 3 years. All the PPV, Hype, Fights, Acting & Story telling put into it has been very Worthwhile. We have witnessed History & we might not understand until these guys are retired & we will remember an All Timer Story.   This is Greatness
The best , I was literally hoping for this before the event started 🤣I was so happy
reigns HAD IT COMING.  HE VERY MUCH DESERVED THAT!   MUST'VE FELT GREAT for Jimmy to FINALLY DO THAT.   WELL DONE, UCE! 👏👏   ☝
The Bloodline story has been phenomenal and still going strong. What a moment!
"Power slap is destroying the WWE in viewership" ~Dana White
MAXWELL JACOB FRIEDMAN > roman reigns. Straight facts!!
Cinematic graves
It’s about time!
Roman Reigns: "Acknowledge me!" Jimmy Uso: "Acknowledge this!" (superkicks Roman)  This is how the Bloodline is falling apart.
HE GOT HIS MEDICINE ROMAN REGINS&YOU GOT WHATS COMING ALSO BRAD supports USOS
BRO, THIS MOMENT!
Jey Broke Character at 0:21
Devastating. I just can’t right now I’m done. Kayfabe or not I’m in total shock.
Roman reigns hic bir zaman kaybedecek olmaz, ama jimmy sen kaybettîn
Jimmy what's wrong with you? And what with you at all? What came into you? 😮 It's not you, you're not like that, you should have listen to your brother, you supposed to be better than that and be above and be smarter and mature as an older brother or just walk away
YES!
0:53 old man roman!! Lol
❤❤The greatest story that has ever been told, and the fact that it's not rushed and allowed to "be"! Is just Awesome!" This is how you WWE! ( Now secure the thing with Disney and give the Marvel Universe the Heroes it actually deserves! The men and women of the WWE!)❤❤
Brihhhhh the way I started yelling when this went down.This story is epic.AEW take notes.
The first kick was emotion  The second kick was clarity
Jey Uso should be out getting movie/TV roles. The man has carried this whole feud going on 2yrs with his acting.
0:55 jimmys roar was so powerful man god I love this
It begins! Bloodline: Civil War!   Solo will be the one to ultimately overthrow Roman (with help from his brothers). But it will ultimately be Jey who ends it all and sends Roman into exile. This entire saga started with Jey and it has to end with Jey.
thas like 3 times roman been on the receiving end of a betrayal he didn’t see coming LOL
0:52 MOMENT OF THE CENTURY
You two get ready to face the dog 🐕 when he wakes 😅
Jey come on kick your superkick😮😮😮😮
haha  nice
He put the Big Dog to sleep. Magnificent!
Great storyline. I love it
Roman reigns ❤
Always listen to your brothers
0:48 him yelling to get his rage out is so real man. Dudes been waiting to kick Romans head off for a minute.
The Bloodline: Civil War
“I GOT CHU”! 0:51   I believe
Why everyone betrays my tribal chief????
SummerSlam main event WWE Undisputed Universal Championship match  Roman (C) vs Jimmy vs Jey vs Solo  And the winner of the match anddd NEWWWWWWW WWE undisputed universal champion Jimmy USO!!!!
About time..... I ve been bored of roman for a long time hopefully he will be off tv for a while
The downfall of the bloodline
Jimmy like a man possessed
Jimmy jimmy jimmy jimmy lets goooo
I saw this coming and I loved it because roman deserves it 🎉🎉🎉
That scream....wow
One day Roman said to Samy " U BROKEN MY FAMILY.." is not true..the reality is that Zamy knew the situation in the BLOODLINE..and as KO said " THE USOS ARE THE BETTER PART IN THE SAMOAN'S FAMILY" anD in this emotional sequence..it denotes how much popularity has burned in Romain the stages of the loved one he was..SO..even if you are the head of the table..you can't treat the family like puppets..Jimmy's action demonstrates how much the BLOODLINE is arrived at the end of the line..!
Jimmys scream after the super kick was everything
At last!! Freedom to Usos!!
My favorite part was I got you  Super kick that was so powerful
0:51 I gotchu! 💥
More satisfying than Sami and KO won the belts 😂
OMG 😳 jimmy's face says it all  Is this the end of the bloodline?
Bloodline is cringe. Here for the fall.
Reigns and Solo vs Jimmy and Jey Jey turns on Jimmy Solo turns on Reigns and joins Jimmy Reigns and Jey vs Jimmy and Solo Slowburn Jey breaking free from Reigns... Reigns vs Jey at Wrestlemania where Jey ends Reigns' title reign!
Poor Jey.  He's always getting put in bad spots, & the middle of everything.
Man what a moment!!! Absolutely shocking, the moment Jimmy Uso super kicked Roman Reigns, I got legit chills, this story has been building up for 3 years, excited to see what happens next now! The next chapter should be amazing 👏👏👏👏
The bloodline is officially over man, why so soon!
Finally, the bloodline is broken ❤
That scream, that reaction and the way he superkick to roman....😮
Finally it happened. Goodbye bloodline, and good ridance.
😂😂😂😂 that was a good superkick glad someone did it roman Reigns though he couldn't get touched and someone got him with a superkick
Beautiful
People liked this?  3 months too late
WrestleMania 40 is gonna be insane
King Back 😅🌍
Yes yes yes
YOU'RE DARE!? 0:24
Glad Jimmy finally gettin his turn to shine and is he shining bright! Amazing storytelling by all involved
Me and my lady jumped off the damn couch when it happened  I thought jey was going to kick him too
Roman is my Favorite. But  Jimmy Uso is right.....great storyline.....instant classic
Jey He finally realized what I had to do and got out of Roman's manipulation, I was happy
FINALLY🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Heyy....why did wwe band the video in our country 🇮🇳🇮🇳
NO WHAT 😱.. Absolutely a pure moment of WWE in 2023..
I find myself getting back into the WWE every few years just for a ne particular guy or storyline. Well done WWE, got me back again with this storyline.
Really good performance
That was the bomb
Finally, now who will Jey side with?
Absolute storytelling
Красавчик так держать давно надо было дать ему
And the academy award goes to..............    This reminded me of why i fell in love with wrestling
Please let him end this ridiculous run
OMG😮😮
" I would never treat you that " that is a true brother from Jimmy's heart ❤
Who didn't see this coming?
One of the best storylines. All-time!
I would love to see jimmy battle Roman for the belt and beat him!
One of the all time great storyline, they got this one perfect.
My aunt and i were happy af when we seen jimmy kick roman hahaha usos deserve to be on their own instead of taking orders from bossy cousin reigns
Yes yes yes!!!
Let Trips COOK!
Lol you messed with the other side of his soul man
Don’t mess with twins brother
That's what I'm talkin about Jimmy uso Roman reign deserve that
The end of bloodline....,
This made me the happiest dude alive. I was so happy Jimmy finally said something to Roman. Been treating them like gum on his shoe for too damn long
Jimmy knows that when he said he's the Tribal Chief there's no turning back from it.
This is awesome,,big up Jimmy uso
0:09-0:52
It’s your funeral jimmy
" I am doing what u should've done a long time."
(dont want to take away from how great ... well everyone in this story has been... but really Jimmy)  but I have to say .... I think there is a chance that OTHER THAN SAMI .... overall the fans are with Jey the most .... this story keeps getting BETTER ... not one good show then they screw it up
Okay that 1st Superkick was shocking... but that 2nd Superkick..and I lost it....😂...it was crazy yet so satisfying!!!
Roman enze anayambo pusa😂
"Listen to me, Uce: I'm doing what you shoulda done a long time ago! I got you!"  Full circle moment right there. Leave it to The Bloodline to finally make the Saudi shows worth something and not just a glorified house show.
I love this storyline. 😂😂😂
question is (I always assumed long term he's stay with Roman and short term he will) .... WELL I ASSUMED that Roman would start seeing that he's wrong ... get "too weak" than Solo + Paul would turn mega heel and take Roman OUT (giving Roman time off to sell the beatdown and come back as a face)   What IF long term ... Roman goes too far attacking Jay and Jimmy and SOLO TURNS FACE, protecting his brothers? .... I think i'd lvoe to see this go EITHER WAY
Its joever
Jey uso was still laughing lol he can't keep a straight face no more
Finally! That was so satisfying to watch
Jimmy to Roman: I'm the Tribal Chief now! 😂
Damn, I missed it
This is good. Never been a fan of Reigns, but this bloodline story has huge potential.
CINEMA!!!! PURE CINEMA!!!
This is the absolute best example of just because its predictable doesnt mean it wont be good, this was amazing
I love you my Tribal Chief Roman Reigns always and forever! Safe journey y’all ❤️
This was exactly what I expected but 100 times more amazing🎉🎉🎉
Either jey or sami or jimmy deserve to dethrone roman reings cody rhodes with his stupid story have no place with this story .please wwe  dont give that spot to cody
Finally jimmy kicks Roman about  time uso done with Roman
finally the bloodline is over
Treacherous dog!!!
GOOSEBUMPS!🔥
This is wonerful long time coming.
After 3 years Roman should lose the titles and take a much deserved break , Hopefully losing them to Jimmy or Rhodes will make sense
Damn, Back to mid card & face paint for my bros 😭😭🤣
At the end of the day Jimmy and Jey are twins and there is no bond on earth stronger than that. Uso's were always loyal to each other first and foremost. Roman and even Solo will always come in second when it comes to Jimmy and Jey's loyalties.
we already know ehats next roman vs jimmy at money in bank
Hopefully this leads to Jimmy vs Roman at the next PPV. Jey showed us what he can do in the main event spot so now it’s Jimmy’s turn.
En efecto, es cine 🚬
now I'm really excited to see what happens next this is storytelling at its finest
bloodline game over roman
haven't been this happy about a move in a whileee lmaoooo this was crazy
Himmy Uso got that dawg in him!!!!
We never had to sell out for Bloodmoney!  - everyone loves the Acclaimed ❤️✂️
The Superkicks heard around the world
It was heard all around the world  this was awesome 👌
Aknowledge Him!!!!!!!!!!!
That scream from Jimmy......Ultimate RAGE moment!!!
When this happened I yelled STOP PUTTING JEY IN THE MIDDLE.
Wow 1.1 m view in just 9 hrs
I KNEW IT! I PREDICTED IT! JIMMY AND JEY TURNING ON ROMAN HAS BEEN MY PROPHECY SINCE THEM JOINING THE BLOODLINE!
One way or another Roman had it coming, and I'm so glad it was Jimmy that did it! Smackdown is going to be LIT this Friday! Hopefully Jey will superkick Roman next and then soon after Solo will join his brothers and Roman will be all alone...
Now THIS IS ENTERTAINMENT 👌🏽
Finally roman lose
How the table has turned.
Im happy :)
It Was Only A Matter Of Time B4 The Uso’s Turned On Roman!!! This Is Gonna Be Epic!!!!
I think the rock will help the usos also there going to be two bloodlines one lead by usos others by Roman
The way roman rolled out of the ring had me dying
Jimmy was the one who kicked Sami first, Jimmy is also the one who kicked Roman first.   I guess Jey isn't the hothead after all huh
I loved too see that, even though as a fan of "Reigns". Can't wait for next week "Smackdown".
I always thought it would be Jey because of their thunderdome rivalry Edit 2th April 2024: i guess i was kinda right
Jimmy did it for The Rock
Bout time Jimmy hit back
About time
WHAT A MOMENT I WAS SHOCKED 😂😂😂
Samis prophecy is true! THE BLOODLINE is crumbling little by little!
FINALLY!
LFG JIMMY USO
This was incredible. I havent gotten in a good yell in a while but watching this, I did!
I like how Paul Heyman scream in despair on the corner. 🤣
I loved this ending best ppv in a long time this bloodline story had so many layers and seeing it unfold has been awesome….. just can’t wait for the next part of the hall out 😊
Jimmy the tribal chief ☝🏻
I don't like this💔
Hey Roman..did you ACKNOWLEDGE that kick to the face..🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jimmy still pissed of for wwe 2k23 89 rating one less from his brother 😆
👏👏
Never you trust any bloodline...  brotherly why
This it’s going as the biggest end of a faction🤝🏽 nice push from Jimmy uso
Good i was waiting for this many times
About time....
What a ppv 👏👏👏
I knew one of them was gonna turn
Just like what Sami zayn did to Romam Reigns, Jimmy uso did the same. Does that mean Jey will be M.I.A. again?
I yelled in my room saying YESSSSSSSSSS!!!
This was incredibly satisfying.
I hope the Usos get separated in there own brands, they are very good in story telling.
Chết mẹ Roman rồi! Vừa lòng tao lắm =))
Good job, The Uso. You two the real chief. Salute...👏👏👏
I want Roman to lose the belt, but overall the bloodline storyline is the best in years
Omg I cried when jimmy super kick roman
Way too emotional to be a tribal chief
I've noticed that Jimmy has bulked up a fair bit, maybe he will be the one to dethrone Roman
very good
Красавчик усо давнопора завас счетроман 3года чемпион малоемусупер усо уважуха👍👍👍🤝🙌🤲🏼🤲🏼🤲🏼🤔😁😁😁🤣😆👍👍👍👏👏👏
Remember when we thought Sami is gonna get betrayed in the Bloodline storyline?   Nope, it was Roman that got backstabbed. Now we wait for Solo and Heyman to turn their back on Roman
Yes yes yes
Let's keep it real Jay has fought Roman reigns . . Before for the championship belt . . and Jimmy have got into it with Roman as well . . They got alot of heart . . But Jey jimmy Solo . . Can't fight each other . . No matter what  Not at this point . . 🤦🤦🤦
This is awesome. 🔥🔥
Perfect 😢 ☝🏼
I knew someone was about to happen when the ref got knocked out
Yeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssss JIMMY❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
To see how everyone is rooting for Roman downfall just proves that he certified himself as a pure villain. That's what the story was meant to be . Everyone is wishing for his downfall right now that means that the fact that he turned heel really worked and he will go down as one of the best villain ever. Just perfect. Ain't nothing I gotta say on this script just 💯💯💯. The bloodline best storyline ever. They won everything to the highest peak, now they lost everything mostly Roman. Am a fan of Roman Reigns but for sure is that when you're the villain in a story, your end is not far and the worst thing is that he's the villain to his own family. Man this story is just pure gold
If they end the bloodline will roman stop wearing red
i think this brought me back to wwe
I was expecting Jey to turn on Roman first. Damn this storyline is good eventually it will only be Roman and Paul Heyman left.
I can’t think of a better story on wrestling history then THIS RIGHT HERE
Man. This is just so good.
The obvious happened
This is probably the greatest storyline in WWE history 0:48
Very nice Jimmy ! Let’s do it 👍🏻👍🏻👍👍🔥🔥🔥
i saw it coming
0:09 0:52
Yes yes yes.
I haven’t been this excited for an ending of a match since no way out 2004
this was the best i will never forget this moment jimmy had of enough jay  should have done long time ago it all good lol two superkick and expression was master piece.
about time
I have to admit I was beginning to get sick of the Bloodline saga but when they keep putting out amazing work like this I get pulled right back in.
I feel like jey wanted to laugh when Jimmy started yelling after the kick
I love Roman but its about time the Usos took back there freedom.
That yell after the 2nd kick is when you knock out the Bully in front of the whole school. This has been a great story. The "oh my god" was the icing on the cake of the moment
I love it 😂😂
I love the way Jimmy screamed after the 2nd kick. Bloodline is hands down the best story in years or even decades
I see a good storyline....
SETH FREAKIN ROLLINS  le dará  jerarquía a  ese titulo se acabó el  aburridísimo  y ya quemado reinado de  BIANCA BELAIR  pero  lo mejor  cine  del mejor  JIMMY  USO   revento  con unos super  kick  al jefe tribal  acabo  con su dictadura y  lo que  le dijo  a su hermano  solo hice  lo que  debimos  hacer  hace  mucho  tiempo  la guerra civil en THE BLOODLINE  comenzó  ver a ROMAN REIGNS  humillado destruido  y que  SAMI ZAYN y    KEVIN OWENS  restregandole  su Victoria  en la cara  a la cabeza de la  mesa  y que  seguramente  de alguna forma intervendrá  en esta guerra  por que  el le va poner el  último  clavo  al ataúd de  THE BLOODLINE  esta historia  se puso  increíble  y  necesita  un final  épico
I was wrong to be upset Cody didn’t win
If this is not 💯 entertainment I don't know what is. This Bloodline drama is way better than Fast X.
Jimmy had enough. Jimmy observed everything that is happening, from Jey being forced to quit to this one. Jimmy did that for Jey as Jey did for Jimmy long time ago. It all come back in full circle.  10 out of 10, Ucey moment for me indeed!
i'm very happy jimmy did this, i wanted this to happen a long time ago too, roman reigns is a piece of trash
I knew this would happen because remember what Sami said to roman   You know its over right
I could see Jey being the one to take down Roman he'll finally fully turn and itll be him and Roman at Summer Slam and Jimmy vs Solo
The question for me is where does Solo lie? Does he support his brothers? Or stay with his cousin? Bearing in mind the usos kicked him, solo seems like the type that will give a receipt no matter who it is
This is it
The best actors in wrestling today are the Usos and Solo then Sammy followed by Roman and lastly Kevin
HIMMY USO.😤
Happiest day in the last couple years of wrestling
You don't assault someone pushing again and again and not expect nothing back do you? 😂 finally the kick that makes things more interesting than ever
Oh yeah oh hell yeah
I've watched this clip a bunch of times lol they still know how to get a reaction out of us. Love how he was like "I got you" before the second kick
Jimmys turn for a title match
Reigns should acknowledge those kicks delivered to him
The Usos have had enough of constant torment and abuse! Almost 3 years of hell!!!! No more!!! Solo if I were you, betray Roman Reigns!!!!! You too Paul!!!!!
This outcome in the tag match was completely predictable. I said in a previous comment before the pay previews that bloodline was going to crumble due to the fact that reigns wasnt defending his titles and in a tag match with solo. Are we sure triple h is really head of creative cuz wheres the unpredictable endings that we'd expect with triple h in control of creative. Cuz this has vince written all over this.
This was amazing  jimmy kicked the living hell out of roman
Yep, Jimmy didn't forget Hell in a Cell 2020
Its about time that Jimmy super kicked him cause nobody likes him it doesn't matter if Roman is a God
rights jimmy
(Rock voice) Finally…👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
My brothers who don’t really watch wrestling, saw this with me and even they were shocked and excited watching it.
Here’s my question: Why did the crowning of the new WWE World Heavyweight Champion at the beginning of the show???? 🤷🏾‍♂️
Finally😮‍💨
It's about damn time the Usos started going down their own path but man I'm just super hyped for next week's Friday smackdown now
Man I wish I could've seen the Anoa'i family's reaction And The Rock's haha
Heres A Hint, He Shouts Alooooha On The Microphone, And Starts Playing His Uklayle, And Sings A Very Old Tale Of Happyness, If You Know Now On Who I Speak Of, Look Up Into The Heavens, And Point To Him.
Bout time somebody did something. I like Roman but god damn let Rhodes hold them belts for a min.
“I got you” *super kick* yeah this was an all timer 🤞🏾💯
0:56 is it just me or was jimmy screaming "DIE"
I really hope jimmy is not taking the leader spot. Cuz main event jey uso deserves it more
I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING!!
Yeeeeeeeah finally its about damn time i been waiting for this to happen
Yessssss yesssssssdssssssssssssssss
We all thought it was gonna be Jey. Jimmy literally snapped like a twig. Good stuff
i kne it would happen
The Bloodline Champange 🚬🗿
Cool 😉😉 Hello from Germany 😉👍
Finally
Shot heard around the world. I haven't said this in years, but I can't wait till SmackDown!
I'm doing what you shoulda done long time ago🤣🤣💀 that's was cold line
Possibly the most intriguing and intense storyline of recent memory. People are saying The Bloodline is Crumbling, I feel like there’s much more to come and this is just the start…
Finish business 😆
DAMN Jimmy USO with The SuperKick heard around the world! This Storyline comes full circle at WWE Money In The Bank. It’s going to be The USOS vs The Bloodline, Roman Reigns and Solo SIKOLA. That Match will mark the end of The Bloodline cause I think Solo is also going to turn on Roman Reigns and choose his brothers or he’ll just go off on his own.
Myself, my wife and my aunt/caregiver were all watching it and we went NUTS!!!!
love it!
Usos debuting in 09 meanwhile debuting in 12 so yeah
Holy Sh** Jimmy You're my Tribal Chief Good job
😂😂😂
Now time to bring in Xyon quinn
Jimmy breathing 🔥🔥🔥
Lets goooooooo🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯
Swerve… thought it would be Jey kicking him, not Jimmy to start ending things with the Bloodline.
The question is, is Solo siding with his brothers or remain loyal to Roman?
Looks like the bloodline is no more
But Reigns is still The Head of the Table and also WWE champion.
Finally 👏👏👏👏
Jey is gonna beat Roman huh
they are a good actor, but not athlete
The first kick had me in shock. The 2nd one had me jump in anticipation and pure excitement lmao.
I am so happy that the Uso's are listening to Sami, Kevin, Matt, and Cody and standing up for themselves because ever since they first joined the bloodline, Roman been using them just liked everyone else he have done to do all his dirty work.
Does Evey One Want The Truth, Don't Ever Support And Be Brainwashed And Terrorized By A Bully, Family Or Not, Do All Of You Want A Ginormis Truth, I Have A Message For The Brothers Fatu 1 And 2, Pass It On To Them, It Is In A Form Of A Riddle, No, Not Matt Bro, A Riddle, A Fun Clue, Ask If They Are Good At Solving Them, Tell Them The Following, Look Up To The Sky, For If You Have More Then Just 1 Query, Then Ask Upon A Magestic King Of The Past For Answers, Then, Look Forward, And Seeketh And Forsuth, For A Missing Piece Of Earth, I'm Seriously Not Joking, Please Pass This Down To Them, I Stronfully Insist It.
The second superkick was so satisfying
This whole thing with the Bloodline and the supporting cast make such a beautiful movie to watch all on its own.
About  time good  job uso
nice kick jimmy.. roman suck
The Tribal Cheat getting what he deserved...beautiful!!😊
They been here for u all this time now you reject them not good man
This storyline right here is what I should have to say amazing. The dramas of the family a’noai is still hotheaded topic. And I’m sick of it. Roman reigns sucks definitely! I’m not follow him anymore and I will never knowledge him. I do acknowledge the first ever world heavyweight champion of modern era, and his name is Seth Rollins. Just like what Sami Zayn Canada said bloodline is collapsing or I should tell a better bloodline is bleeding.
At this point its only this vs mcmahon/austin for greatest long term storyline ever in wwe. Feuds is a different convo but this is up there for pure storyline
Good job Jimmy
It’s the bloodline revolution
Bruh the way Roman just fell out the ring has me weak😂😂😂
Bout time
AEW의 패배!!! 🤩
Roman reigns had it coming
My favorite WWE moment since hurricane beat the rock.
This was THE match of the PPV. Perfect storytelling, amazing choreography, and enthralling drama. Jimmy's second kick to Roman gave me chills. That was months or even years of bottled-up anger being released when he screamed at him. So far this has been WWE's best year in a long time for storylines.
yes ok🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟👍👍👍👍👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Jimmy Uso was kinda acting like he was drunk in my opinion
True television gold!! We are truly witnessing history with this storyline. Decades from now, there will most assuredly be DVD’s and documentaries made about this storyline. I’m so glad I got to witness this entire storyline in my lifetime. The pop Jey gets when he finally turns on Roman is going to be an instant classic!
Jimmy Uso the REAL MVP
go Youtube : are you a good person . The author of this video is Living Waters.
Good job Jimmy
End Of An Era
"I'M DOING WHAT YOU SHOULD'VE DONE A LONG TIME AGO!"   It all comes full circle.. The best storyline and the best faction in the WWE hands down... Gonna miss these kind of moments when it's all said and done..
There were 6 of us gathered around the TV watching this match and when Jimmy hit that first superkick on Roman it was sooooo loud in my house!  On the 2nd kick it was twice as loud.  NO ONE saw that coming tonight.  I admit I haven't been this glued to WWE since since the Stone Cold McMahon feud, and frankly this one to me is far more intense.  Just wow......!!!!  Kudos to the writers, performers, and huge props to Roman Reigns for keeping this story so intense and personal.
Peak cinema right here
Damn I almost turned Super Saiyan from the screaming when Jimmy hit that second kick.
I only liked the video because I'm tired of Roman Reigns 🎉
It was so nice roman reign become a person with bad ambition did not suppose to own the uso any more
I Hope JEY Win's the Big ONE!
Roman Reigns deserves all of that
Damn hes really snap it, keep on goin
I'm gonna miss the We The Ones Titantron and with them on the Bloodline, but still, the adrenaline that I feel is 🔥
MAINEVENT JIMMY
I just wish the 2nd super kick is a double super kick from both of the USO'S that would have been MAGNIFICIENT!
In my POV, the only way to end the bloodline is The Rock turning heel and dethrone Roman to proclaimed as THE TRUE TRIBAL SAMOAN CHIEF, making a way for Roman to turn to babyface and disband the Bloodline for good. It starts by Roman, it ends by Roman.
This was so well done.
To quote Bobby "The Brain" Heenan when he said this at the end of Spring Stampede 1997 however I'm going to change the names. "Come on Roman you messed up everyone else's life now let's see you put it back together"
Yeah it's scripted and all....but the storyline...and the emotion in all of it....totally real...
I did what you were supposed to do…I gotchu 👟💥🙌🏿💯😩
Jimmy Uso vs Roman Reigns
The Rock needs to come in and set the bloodline straight
And you know your brother's right jimmy take that bloodline bulshit off come back with the face paint old Usos with the haku oh my God man for reals come on HHH don't fail me man 😠
It’s going to kick off after this
Can someone please explain to me what is going on?😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
It was so beautiful I had to watch it again and again and again and again as Farooq would say Dame 🤣
Now we need the Uso's vs The broken bloodline
Now the fun begin 😂😂😂
While Jimmy flattening Roman with a superkick was satisfying AF. The only thing I’m waiting for is Roman and Jay FINALLY going to war with each other. I seriously want Jay to beat Roman…title or not. The bloodline story can only end with Jay beating Roman.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👍😍
About DAMN Time!!!!
We were expecting the Vloodline to explode soon. But Im pretty sure most of us never expect it would be Jimmy who pulled the trigger hahaha What a shocker
🔥🔥🔥🚀
"im doing what you should've done a long time ago"  damn that line got so deep
I’ve been waiting weeks for this to happen
When jimmy scream I’m your brother that hit 😂
Roman Reigns is the 🐐
It was good.    Is what happens in Saudi Arabia canon for WWE?
Time to blow up the Bloodline! They need a rebuild
NICE AWSOME YESSSSSS
Have a feeling this is just a miscommunication. Just like The Shield and Kane back in 2014
I was waiting for this superkick for a very long time!
So glade Jimmy had the sense to do it all that needs to happen now is get Jay think the same way he is the usos will never break up there brothers and as Jimmy said he got Jay
I’ve always said it had to be jimmy because him & jimmy never had it out since day one
Jimmy tried to protect Jey from HIAC years ago and Jimmy got put in Guillotine now this is storytelling
😡😡😡
JEY DINT KICK ROMAN DUE THAT HE WAS FEELING A BIT UCEY 😂😂
Roman now really2 mad!!
the greatest story of the WWE ever is the bloodline story.
That scream from Jimmy after the second kick. He owned this moment, cannot wait to see what happens next.
Main event Jimmy Uso perhaps?
When Jimmy screamed after the super kick it was like a yell of relief and letting out all his pain I felt that yell in my soul
FINALLY! YYEESSS!! And so it begins dawg! This storyline is looking good and I can’t wait to see what happens next!
Wow this is awesome
I love this
amazing storytelling yooooo
Jimmy  💪💪💪                                   roman reigns 👎👎👎
Funny how they keep swapping back and forth over who attacks him(at least teases it), also how did Roman manage to both sell and not sell the first kick?
An Incredible Moment.
I could watch this video over and over again. Just like Romen was champion for 1000 days, I watched the video 1000 times.
About time.
It’s gonna come full circle if jey ends up fighting Roman again than it’ll probably be Jey vs Cody
This story geting good did not like in the beginning but things are heating up the super kick Jimmy
This was down right awesome
RR should get superkick....
Having Jey be the one trying to keep the Bloodline united under Roman's rule and speak out against these acts of defiance is such an intricate aspect of this storyline. He was the one so adamantly against Roman's new demeanor and behavior in the beginning, but now he's the one trying so hard to get back into Roman's good graces.
Good
Jimmy Uso HOF 🙌
Someone wake me up when Cody gets a shot at the belt....
the scream jimmy let out after the 2nd superkick gave me chills
I can only imagine when Solo  has just about enough of Roman .
WWE is fake
The bloodline is over
About time someone puts roman in his place
The way Roman slithered out on the floor. Awesome, Jimmy, Awesome.
About bloody time
Roman vs Jimmy for the titles
I've watched wrestling since '91 and seen a lot of great stuff, but The Bloodline story has been the best thing I've ever seen because it's delivered on a consistent basis for several years.  A+
I DON'T BLAME JIMMY ONE DAMN BIT
OOH GOOD EPISODE ALL THE TIME
Been waiting for a year
YES!!!!!!! FINALLY!!!!! BEST MOMENT EVER
I CANT WAIT FOR THIS TO BE IN THE BLOODLINE STORYLINE FOR WWE2K30
Y'all remember when Jimmy told Roman "i am my brother's keeper"?? That hits different after this🔥
Jimmy: "I'm doing what you should have done a long time ago"  The superkick heard around the world. Damn right Jimmy!!!
Con todo respeto pero la wwf ya nos esta cansando por que por el asuto de el linage si Román rey no tiene el apoyo de los uso nk yebaria prácticamente 3 años de campeon y si no cambia de campeon se van a perdidas dígamen si me equivoco Dios los bendiga 😊
1 more time 1 more time 1 more time 1 more time 1 more time 1 more time 1 more time 1 more time please
First Seth, then Sami and now jimmy
Roman's arc ☑️ Jey's arc ☑️ Heyman's arc ☑️ Sami's arc ☑️ Solo's arc ☑️ Jimmy's arc ...
Looks like Roman is about to loose his titles
Best wwe Storyline
We all thought it would be Jey! But Jimmy is the one that snapped and stopped taking the abuse from Roman! This is just cinema!!
Another biggest wwe betrayel😅 This year two already
THIS is how you build a long-running storyline! sincere kudos to Creative for writing this and to all involved for playing it out so believably and awesomely!
Wow did that just happen😱😱😱
now i found a reason to lk this guy
Let's goooooooooooooooooooooo
Long live the king!
The Bloodline Will Disbanded
Jimmy vs roman
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Good, now finally Roman’s “plot armor” is gone and the interferences in his match less likely.  Time to drop those titles soon.
It reminds me that this year royal rumble ..That jimmy were the one super kick sami while jey getting upset and hesitation about them..
The only thing that wouldve made it better if jimmy wore the shirt that said nobodys fool. Jimmy did a damn good thing.
Does this mean that The USOs are no longer on The Bloodline?
When jimmy USO kicked roman this whole world moved
YES!!🗣️🗣️🗣️
Yes
About time
thankfully jimmy didn't say 'i did it for the rock',..just like his father,..
Arrivo della bestia e vicino westermia 40
🔥🔥🔥🔥
It is high time
The table has turn..
This is on the New York Post. Great storytelling👏🏿
Thank god, this head of the table stuff is wack
Damn the storytelling all these guys deliver 🔥
This was freaking incredible!
I wasn't surprised. Too predictable.
Roman Reigns deserves a Life Sentence in the Uso Penetentiary
The best part is Jimmy's reaction on the second kick actually felt like he had been holding back pain and anger towards a abuser he finally stood up too
Poor Roman. Always being surrounded by traitors.
this was crazy to see in person
Yeeeeeeeesssssssssss
Roman is going to Hollywood, so they have to do something to end the Bloodline
roman's abuse of power ends as the usos had enough of his abusive behavior.
Woke my son up for this one
finally Jimmy can't take it anymore lmao
I Acknowledge Jimmy Uso
Jimmy is now the Tribal Chief.
One of the best moments that will go down in wwe history jimmy finally sees the light.
Roman vs Jimmy and Jey Uso in a gauntlet match for the WWE Championship and Universal Championship separately.
finally he betrayed whether the bloodline will disband
Now that is perfection...
Seki seki
Jimmy snapped.
Great job of selling the superkick by Roman.
Yeah not shedding a tear here or anything... A love story.
Jimmy vs Roman Reigns For the undisputed titles next
I called it on Friday Night about Jimmy being the first to crack 😊
Damn I loved seeing Jimmy Uso FINALLY super kicking Roman Reigns overinflated head in.
Brazzers logo in the thumbnail would make this a very different video
Don’t disrespect my brother
I got such a adrenaline rush,  been waiting for this for so long
The best would have been if jay did it and continued to argue
Bro Romen got owned😂
The Super Kick Heard Around The World!  🤯🫨
That Was powerful
He did it, for Jey
Goooooood
I’d pay good money to see Roman get 1D’ed by the Usos. ☝️
The USOs sa we the ones. Well Roman jimmy USO say you the one now
The greatest wrestling storyline of ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!! Roman! Solo! Jimmy! Jey! Cinema GOLD!!!!!!!!!!! All future 2 time hall of famers!!!
That was good
Who would have thought Jimmy was gonna be the first to turn on Roman
The fact that I don't even really watch wrestling anymore or care for it, but I am fully behind this moment is awesome!!! Epicccccccccccc
Oh man. I can’t wait for this Monday’s Raw
He defiinetly had it coming it to him lol
This is what we've been waiting for
part of me wanted Jey to MAYBE kick Jimmy
This moment was wasted on this crowd.
Hell yeah!! Finally 😂👌
I truly love it my boys the usos don’t need Roman
They should have jumped him
About time
Go Jimmy!! Have rikishi come and stink face him too
This fills me with such joy DOWN GOES THE TRIBAL CHEAT DOWN GOES THE TRIBAL CHEAT!!!!
Roman deserves it
Bro the pop 0:53
HIMMY MF USO ALL DAY
WWE is all lie
Am I the only one who kept replaying Jimmys second super kick to Roman??
Main event jimmy
😮omg😮 beautiful moment
Roman is selfish he deserves it
The Bloodline Is Coming To A End Finally
This may have just got me back into wrestling
This is perfect development for Jimmy he was always a Psycho, when Sami Zayn join he was buddy buddy with him then as soon as he betrayed no hesitation he he superkicked Sami, the Minute Roman Punked him out he didn’t take any of it. People were complaining that he want getting booked properly but he was booked perfect.
“I’m doing what you should’ve done a long time ago.” CINEMA
I'm just waiting for Randy Orton to come back
Best storyline in a long time hands down.
HISTORY MADE.
Stupid guy jimy usos
Finally WWE are creative
Someone’s in trouble 🥴😂
How are you guys so interested in this fake soap opera garbage LOL?!  Go watch MMA or something. This some bull jive
Jey was on a level of restraint i never could accomplish. I'd have kicked at least someone.
THAT was awesome!
I don’t blame him you ain’t about to keep mushing my brother IN MY FACE Roman got life fuked up!!
That was Jimmy’s way of saying, “Get your hands off my brother!”
T y jimmy uso
yes!! I love it!!!!
0:08, 0:09, 0:10, 0:51, 0:52!
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A tear jerker...we love you Jey, you and Jimmy are the strength. Jimmy showed Jey not to be afraid anymore. From Grandma and my two sons
The bloodline storyline is the best thing in all of wrestling right now. That was amazing.
That rage anger from Jimmy i felt that ❤ the way Jimmy Super Kick the hell out of Roman's face it's like me want to do it to him for years for being a cheater chumpion. Now he got his death wish you don't piss off The Usos  🔥🔥🔥he literally deserve that beating 💯 The Bloodline is coming to it's end
Roman probably gonna drop the titles at SummerSlam then either retire or go Hollywood
2023 don't look good for roman Reigns. Sami Zayn blasted Reigns at the rumble with a chair shot and Jimmy USO super kick Reigns twice. The Big Dog better Slow his role.
This Story Just Keeps Getting Better...Dont Think Its Stops Anytime Soon!
About time 👊👀
Props to Paul L. and Paul H. for crafting such a masterpiece of a story.
Roman lấy được đai và giữ được đai là nhờ bầy đàn chứ bản thân anh ta cũng không có gì xuất sắc lắm. Tôi thích Jimmy ra tay như vậy để lão ta hiểu được sự đời!
Thank you for a great storyline, HHH!
Roman really "Acknowledged" that kick to the face 😂
That was a great build to an already broken team. Now its the other brother that's doing what should've been done. Every since Roman disrespected the true 1Day.
After the Bloodline imploded, Jimmy or Jey will finish everything they’ve started 3 years ago. Once they turned on their cousin, Cody will be the one to End The Story. And finally, The Rock will return to WWE once more and put an end to the Historic 1,000 Day Reign as WWE Undisputed Universal Champion. 🇵🇭
About time
RAW and Smackdown are MUST SEE next week!!!
Roman reigns deserve to be kicked in the face..way to go jimmy...Roman is nothing but a bully period.. now they see the true Roman reigns.. he has let that belt get to his head...way to go k.o Sammi zayn
헬로우드님 일하고 계시겠죠? 싱글벙글
And now, it’ll be beyond awesome, Sami got his, then it was jimmy’s, and when jey finally does it, that will be the deciding factor in Roman losing the titles, which if I had to guess, will be summerslam. By how this story is playing out, the timing makes more sense for it to happen then than wrestlemania next year. What a journey. Still can’t stand that over pushed, over rated, spoiled brat that’s had more in this business than freakin hulk Hogan, but he’s played his part in this story well. Sami, Kevin, the usos, solo, Paul, Cody, every body’s been great, but the true main star in this is jey, and it’s been since fall 2020 this moment has been coming, and the pop will be enormous
Jimmy did the right thing, Jey should do the same
This felt so good to see
Honestly the USO's brothers would be a good villain in a Fast & Furious movies
Also, GET JEY A MOVIE ROLE ASAP
Wow haha we all saw Jey again do the clapping while saying what did you do huh!?
Lol 😮
❤❤👍👍💪💪💪💪
You've gotta think that Jimmy is gonna be cooler with Sami and KO now, this is exactly what they've been telling them they should've done from the jump. Either way, this is easily going down as the greatest storyline in WWE history.
Roman Reings 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn are right! They warned them to turn on their former master of the Bloodline! 🇵🇭
Apparently superkicks are more effective to roman than Sami. Interesting.
They can just handicap roman reigns and take the titles for themselves.
A Bloodline Civil War is coming! Believe that....
Use this post as like counter for people satisfied with Roman getting kicked in the face by Big J
I wasn’t impressed by tonight’s PPV…
This shows you that no matter how loyal you are to your family sometimes enough is enough when you're done getting taken advantage of.
And here i though it was gonna be Jey to strike first😮 The question now in my mind is how is Solo going to react
From Roman putting the guillotine on Jimmy to make Jey quit in Hell in a Cell to Jimmy with two super kicks in Jedda….  One thing that WWE do every blue moon is a compelling long term story and the Bloodline is the standard of long term storytelling that will be the first storyline that is worthy enough to be considered for induction into the WWE Hall of Fame!! Job well done to the writers and most importantly…. the men who were involved in this three year program  Roman Reigns Jey & Jimmy Uso Solo Sikoa Paul Heyman Kevin Owens Sami Zayn
Haha😂 😂 Yes ! Now Just Looking Forward To Jay USO Being The Next One To SuperKick Roman’s Head Off His Shoulders !
They breaking up and payback. That's last 2020 at Hell in the Cell.
My heart shattered Mt bloodline is cracking
Jey should of done it along time ago
can't even describe the adrenaline rush I got when Jimmy kicked Roman. This was absolutely amazing.
Should have gotten more close ups of Paul's face he's so good at selling
0:46 could not agree with jimmy more
That was a certified hood clasic
Let's gooo, finally, The Bloodline is broke!!!
Was about Tim good
An Eye For An Eye from Wrestlemania 39 Night 2!
He deserves what he got from Jimmy
Wow
Imagine if he did that on Roman's championship match with no DQ so Roman's loses the title.
This is cinema.
Will it was bound to happen sooner than later I suppose
And the Bloodline is officially over and so is Roman's title reign
I knew it was gonna happen eventually
The roof will explode when Jey finally kicks Roman
He stood up to him that’s what he did to him
This is now in the history books for WWE 🎉
That's what we want ❤🤣
I can’t stop watching this Jimmy is a real 1 can’t wait to see what happens next
I’m glad I started back watching once RR was being used correctly and this Bloodline storyline is nothing short of amazing! Not since the Attitude Era or Ruthless Aggression have I been so satisfied.
The Fall of the Bloodline
The look on his face after the 1st one. The primal scream of rage after the 2nd one. Wwe need to make this Boodline saga for the last 2yrs into a movie!
In the words of the Rock.... "FINALLY!"
The scream got me. The smiling and gentles one are always the most dangerous
The only thing that would of been better if they hit Roman with the 1-D
☝️
0:51 dammit Jimmy what are you doing
"I'm doing what you should've done a long time ago. I got you." That line was so well thought out because Jimmy did it twice instead of letting Jey do it because he wanted Jey to see that 2 people were now sick of Roman's abuse. He was the one that started this with Roman
It's Official that's the Babyface Jey and Jimmy we know since their 2010 debut on WWE The Usos is turning on to Roman  😍😍😍❤❤❤💯💯💯 Holysh*t!!! The way Jimmy Super Kick the hell out of Roman is satisfying intense 🔥🔥🔥 Damn!!! Jimmy is literally pissed off to Roman for years that's 🔥🔥🔥😈 Roman now got his death wish 😈 Bloodline is done it's crumbling now Bloodline is falling apart betrayals break ups. Roman is gonna be dethroned soon  💯 wait until Solo will Samoan Spike Roman soon and Paul Heyman will leave Roman too.  New WWE Undisputed Universal Champion will be crowned soon 👑 and its on the way 💯
Finally
Now the bloodline all are break out
If they fight I got jimmy
CINEMA
It's about time!!!
The usos vs roman reigns and solo sikoa at summerslam
Jimmy had the balls to do what jey couldn’t
I was like welp goodnight everyone 😂😂😂😂
JIMMMMYYYYYY
I loved that ish lol sport entertainment
Enough abuse was enough. Good job jimmy even after you got a second dui.
What A moment wow, Looking forward to SmaCkdown
One and done
The 1000 day this the end of Roman Reigns 😭
I am so glad my bf got me into wrestling just in time to experience such moment
Idk why jey was mad, Jimmy wasn't gonna take the abuse from roman no more
This puts a smile on me
All Time Classic 🏆🐐
That was a certified Banger right there but the way Jay looked at Jimmy after he kicked Roman the second time I hope Jimmy knows what he's ready for cuz he never had to take that beating like Jey Uso did
next time  WWE Championship 💪💪👌👌👌💯💯💯
Now that's the real Jimmy i can see
why do I feel like Seth eating popcorn back stage watching
Don't put your hands on HIS MF BOTHER AGAIN!
I have been totally waiting for this, now new movies to be acted😂😂😂😂
Everyone loves jimmy 😎 but just don’t push him too far to the edge 🤬
I can’t wait till Monday!!
Roman Reigns deserves it!!
Now it’s time for Roman to loss the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship titles at Summerslam. For Real this time.
Goodluck to you Jimmy solo and roman revenge on you
The bloodline had ups and downs but there's one thing that never changed and that's the usos' relationship, i love them so much i hope they never separate them, they are the goats!!
This.... Is..... Cinema!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
😆 🤣  the Wiseman face  lol : Jimmy why you do it (I did it for the rock) lol
Up until now, Austin vs. McMahon has been the greatest storyline imo. This being because all the greatest storylines touch on angles that are universally relatable.  With Austin and McMahon, the low blue collar rebelling against the corporate tyrant struck a profound chord with the people. We all universally identified with it and lived vicariously through Austin. Just as, if not moreso universal, is the liberation of breaking away from chains from the hold of an abusive person in your life. Every WWE fan who's had to live through that personally no doubt felt this moment and Jimmy's scream in the depths of their soul. The Austin v McMahon story no longer stands alone.
You can only abuse a dog so many times before he bites .. today Roman got bit
I wanna cry cuz of how good this is. THIS IS CINEMA. This is literally hands down the best storyline of the last 2 decades comment if you disagree
Just as i expected hahahaha 😂😂
Jimmy ia right. He just did what Jey should do it long time ago.
And now the Usos will go back to being irrelevant
Padan muka kau lahanat roman, eksenn lebih..
THIS STORYLINE "THE BLOODLINE" ITS THE BEST STORY IN 2 DECADES... KEEP THE STORY ROLLING🙄🙄🙄
THE BEST PART OF THE NIGHT.
OMG 😱😱😱😱 SIIIII TE LO MERECE AQUEROSO ROMAN REINGS
Jimmy did it again he tired of his cousin treating his twin bad
That scream he did … hell I felt that
Nice
Surprised now omg
Jey’s character is so layered, he's been through so much! He is the most loyal of them all and now he is torn. His actions ultimately show that nothing is stronger than his bond with his twin: He said i quit for him, he came back for him, he kicked Sami to protect him. Jey can't betray Roman that easily though like Jimmy for obvious reasons but when he overcomes them it's gonna be cinematic 💯 ps: the way Jey kept shouting Roman's real name "Joe" after the kicks was heartbreaking, made it so much more personal!
The bloodline is over just like 619 with his son😢
They’ve always focused on jey the most. I’m glad Jimmy getting his shine. Now we need solo to turn his back on Roman too
Nice my man destroy roman
😆😆😆se termino el linaje ,la familia
We all know Jimmy really did it for the rock
Finally 👏👏👏
Love the look of intensity Jimmy had and the confliction of Jey
Jimmy was right. "I would never do you like that! I would never treat you like that! I'm your brother!" Roman have to realize that the usos are his family not sidekicks.
I knew the bloodline would crumble. Can't wait to see the fall of roman. Yeah...
Without a doubt the greatest storyline in my lifetime
Felt so nice he did it twice
That was the most meaningful super kick in all of wrestling
Bruh the main even lock down penitentiary is up👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
This is how you tell a story
As surreal as the first kick was it was the second that really got me out of my seat. Damn amazing writing. Just when I thought this story had become stagnant it turns it up
big smile on my face night is made
Finally didn’t expect jimmy to do it but he’s had it coming
God bless you ❤
ok ok wwe is watchable again
Roman deserves it!!!
I knew they were gonna cost Roman and Solo the titles..
Revenge For Guillotine Him Back 2 Or 3 Year's Ago... MAY 28, 2023
Good job ❤❤
Crowed sucked compared to Puerto Rico
Now jey needs to get his spine back
Reigns over here having flashbacks
Would be better if Jey controls BOTH Jimmy and Roman and says something like "You're still the Tribal Chief but you won't last 1000 days without us, you need us"
When said I got you and then super kick roman again. Beautiful.
FINALLY!!!
NO 🐋
How it feels to chew 5 gum 0:01 0:04 0:05 0:09 0:22 0:26 0:41 0:44 0:52 Stimulate your senses
Very good
This is the BEST 1:11 WWE clip EVER 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 watching on repeat!!!! Would love to see WWE Superstars reaction to this!!!
I got goosebumps when Jimmy said “I got you”
Oh man I could watch this all day... 😭😭 Its just so damn EFFIN beautiful! THANK YOU JIMMY
A emo loser
0:09 GOLD 0:51 GOLDEN
My only question for anyone is what’s gonna go on between Roman and solo🤷‍♂️
This is the best moment of Usos' career!  We've been waiting for this!🎉
About damm time!
Jimmy, you are an evil loser and you smell like dirty old socks, and jealous of Roman reigns because he’s better smarter stronger than you because you’re just wanna be
Jimmy uso's 💯👏👏👏👏👏🤙
I loved this but this should’ve been Jey’s moment. He should’ve done it first.
Incredible, he gave him a double up......the used to be my homie used to be ace, now I wanna just slap the taste out your mouth.......
He keeps thinking of himself but not his family
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Heh I mean the head of the tables deserve that it is time for the usos to be the GOAT of the wwe
WWE why why
The end of the Bloodline
Long term storytelling, brilliantly executed by any standard! Two years of Jimmy, who by virtue of an injury allowed his brother to be victimized by Roman, now stands tall and starts to repay that debt.
"I'm doing what you should have done a long time ago," enough said. What a moment!
The moment Jimmy realized Sami was right.
damm uce
Jimmy Hair on his face added the extra effects this storyline needed!! Genuine Entertainment
I watched this live…..salute to WWE 🔥
ONE. MORE. TIME 😳
Ooooohhh!!! That's gotta hurt!!
Am I really the only one who is heart broken by this? 💔💔💔
Jey saying " why you do that " like a kid was phenomenal
Masterpiece 🔥
it good for Roman cause he over doing it😂😂😂😂🎉😊
Can we talk about Roman’s selling ?
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you Jimmy, acknowledge that Roman!
Hhh is a genius
ABOUT DAMN TIME!
Perfection itself! And I hope Roman's thousand-day rule ends
Final The Bloodline has end
Saw that coming a mile away
Its good jimmy wouldn't let him disrespect him n his brother like that
AHAHAHAHAHAAHAHA 😂😂😂😂😂
Fue lo mejor que pudieron haber hecho los usos this is numbers 1!!!!!!!!
That's What I,m Talking About
this story telling and Roman Reigns title reign (no pun intended) is hard to do in today's modern wrestling and keep it interesting because of how long it lasted not since the 80's has a storyline lasted as long
Well deserved😂😂
Sometimes u gotta do what you have to do 🤷
Yes yes yes yes yes
Bruh that first kick I felt it... But that SECOND kick I really felt it..
Best part was Sami Zayn of Syrian decent walking in and match in Saudi and having everyone cheer for him.
Roman reigns 🤣🤣🤣
Jimmy hell yeah man
It's about time
Full circle moment, when Jimmy first joined he didn't want any of Romans bs but soon fell in line. Now he comes to the realisation he was right all along.
The Superkick heard around the world
Letgouso
triple h is making a crazy story come true
It's about time Jimmy uso did what he did, proud of him. Enough is enough.
Wonderful ❤
Thank you Jimmy
Jey:watcha doin us  Jimmy: listen to me us im doing what you've should've done a long time ago.
Wow 😅, wwe becoming epic again
good bye bloodline
0:57 Damn. That scream from jimmy uso 😮
Yesssssssssss
About time.
WELCOME TO THE USOS PENITENTIARY BOOMAN REIGNS!
My guy said "i got you" and kicked Roman in the head
In the words of Borat: wowwowiwah
First it was Seth, now it’s Jimmy 😂
It’s Happening  Bloodline Civil War
Wow. I knew this will happen but didn't think it went much more than I've anticipated
I’d do the same thing if somebody put they hands on my brother like that. Bloodline be damned. This story is great! Glad it didn’t end abruptly at Mania
Yessss finallly!!!!!!!!
I haven’t seen something this cathartic in a LONG time.
Finally por fin 😅
Now I can ACKNOWLEDGE THAT! UCE BABY!
Best moment of the night 👍
Jimmy should be Champ. He just knocked Roman out.
😲😲😲😲
If you are a ref calling a Roman match you have a 99% chance of taking a bump 😂😂
When jimmy yelled out all that frustration
I can feel Roman’s wwe championship ara ending
Just when I think I'm out...they pull me back in... Best storyline in any company in Years
Roman sucks!
Since there’s so many rumors of Reigns taking a break, I hope it goes down like this:  Build-up a fight between Roman and Jimmy for the next PPV, Jey has to stand by the ring and watch, Roman looks to seal the deal, Solo comes in looking to support Roman but takes him out. Now Solo is in charge and Usos follow suit. The writing is on the wall for Solo taking over in any case.
Yessss!!!
This storyline makes The Bloodline still better 😂
Roman Reigns made a mistake because he messed up with a Samoan twins. You don't wanna mess up with Samoan.
That Scream was the Highest Rated Level of Emotion 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is Cine 🚬🚬
Noooooo😢 poor Roman. He deserves better
Silly little boys 😅
Nice
Michael's "OH my god" was phenomenal
Whos here when jimmy said "I'm the tribal chief" in smackdown and i didn't expect that he meant what he saying as for that he superkicked roman reigns, well how should jey respond when they accidentally kick their solo and having emotional damage when everything changes when sami zayn strikes roman first
Finally
Nice!!!
Love this❤
The Roman Empire is starting too crumble
Just loved this
Now trips pulled the trigger this was the beauty of this he could’ve easily kept this going for a bit longer but he surprised us.
Certified ALLAHU AKBAR moment in that head towel wearing nation
It's been a long time coming for that from the Usos
This was needed!
It been building up to this Roman treating jimmy and jey like they are trash like jimmy say he is the tribal chief
Roman Reigns Deserves It. 🔥🔥🔥   And Congrats to Kevin Owens And Sami Zayn for Destroying The Title Names Roman Reigns And Solosikoa.
I’m glad that jimmy did it
Look at all of you idiots cheering the story now after crying so hard after Wrestlemania.
now that was UCY!!!!!
YEAHAHAHAAA the bloodline imploded ✊😂✊😂💔❣💔❣
Ooooh Friday is gonna be insane. Roman is celebrating his 1000 day as champion that night, the usos burned all bridges tonight, solo still dazed and confused as to how TF everything went down and wants answers, sami and Kevin still champions and damn its all gonna be hell. Can't wait
The first time Jey shock look brother Jimmy very...very Angry😲
Now we need Jimmy to Break the Universal Title so it can be retired.
This needed to happen 😤
That face Jimmy makes when he realizes he probably just messed up tho
jimmy 🤬go to hell
jimmy is in a big big trouble for sure
Finally the Bloodline is no more Jimmy USO made sure of that super kicking Roman twice LoL 😆😆
The super kick heard around the world
Damn, that scream by Jimmy I felt that.
What jimmy told jey is 💯true!!,jimmy doing what jey should of done a long time ago👏🙌🙌
jimmy you're one of the best but what a horrible superkick
Finally.. a triple power bomb would have been the icing on the cake but I'll take this.  Great story telling.. be funny if the family Exiles Roman on smackdown.
Roman i fw him but Jey needs to wake up
Paul Heyman looking on with awe
Got the biggest smile on my face ever. Well done Jimmy 👏
Finally
This is confirmation jimmy secretly wanted jey to turn on roman.. when he seen jey fallback in line he said he will do it himself 😂
Going to be the most watched video in wwe history
Story telling at its finest😊
Man, I lost it when he kicked him the second time. This was pure Wwe magic!
Just when I was out…they pull me back in!
I'm so pissed that I missed this, I thought it would just be spear, kickout, superman punch, spear, 123, Roman wins again. But instead, WWE doesn't treat Saudi events like house shows anymore and throws this at us.
Well I just became a huge Jimmy fan.  The "I GOT YOU" Then pulls the trigger a second time. NO HESITATION. All for his brother.
LETS GOO JIMMY
The first kick was… okay finally, thank you. The second kick… just like MC said it “OMG” is the best possible reaction. Shows that nothing was a mistake and he is sick of the disrespect. That second kick was so much more deeper than the first.
Very good
I'm doing what you should've done a long time ago. I got you!!!❤🔥 Not that's a true brother right there folks
The Rock needs to come back and put Roman Reigns in check. The Rock is the real Tribal Chief 🤷🏿‍♂️
Ok the first kick was great but can we agree it was the second one that made us all cheer the most! The second one was the real F*** you to Roman
I hate that these God awful Saudi shows are cannon now. That actual real impactful story developments happen in these morally wrong shows.
About time!
Cinematic Magic
Traidores da pátria. Pagarão o preço.
Never see Jimmy look crazy like that
Now the rock should return and handle this
That boy Jimmy had enough of Roman
Jimmy is the mf man!!
These guys are going to be freaking superstars, people love them they are an amazing talent and I can't wait for the day they are superstars and headlining Wrestlemania.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾
Big F U to Roman , thank you ! 🖕
The crowd🔥🔥
Bravo eso fue hermoso
Way to go Jimmy, Nice super kick to Reigns 😂. Jimmy has more balls than Jey ever does. Atleast Jimmy super kick Reigns twice
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This is cinema
He had it coming
This....this right here is GREAT story telling
FINALLY
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The beginning of the end. Hate to say "I told you so", but....told you so.
So this is it? No more "bloodline"? Wow so after all this time NOBODY in the whole roster defeated them. They NEVER got their comeuppance. They are the ones who defeated themselves. Bravo.
I said Jimmy was the one. The jokester is the most dangerous when pissed off💯💯👊🏽👊🏽
BOUT DAMN TIMEEEE!!!!!!!!!
The second kick is called Avada Kedavra
This moment will live in infamy...Roman, you asked for it
GOAT STORYLINE CHEEEEEEEEHOOOOOOOO
I knew it this will happened
😆😆😆 the tribal queef
Perfection
Seeing jimmy kick roman was worse than seeing seth rollins betray roman 😭
Finally
HE IS, THE TRIBAL CHIEF
Jimmy Uso just became HIM & we need main event Jey back 🩸☝🏾
Had to happen
Jimmy common. Why did you do this?
Come on! It's me and you now! It's me and you now! We the ones, not him! I'm your brother, not him! I would never do you like that. I would never treat you like that. I'M YOUR BROTHER!    That ish had me all in my feels.
Finally,  this was so great.  More more
passing the torch to jimmy i guess instead of cody
I see a new champ on the horizon
Best storyline
El fin del linaje
I can't even describe the adrenaline rush I got kicking Jimmy Roman. This was absolutely amazing.
Haven't watched in years is it good again?
First Seth.  THEN Sami.  NOW Jimmy.  (Next Jey?)   Roman Reigns is gonna have trust issues and be a paranoid man FOREVER.
Very dramatic
Yea Roman done time for vacation
I don't THINK SO! Jimmy and Jay better get their butts back in line! We need the full Bloodline to celebrate 1,000 days of the championship of our Tribal Chief!
I knew this was gonna happen ever since what Jimmy Uso did at smackdown last night
The Tribal Chief isn't supposed to lose matches, that's almost like losing respect in the bloodline.
Just like in wwe evolution it all came down eventually
That was spectacular but would have loved to see the 1D
That's what he gets and for not defending his titles once again, it's called night of champions,  the champ is suppose to defend SMH,  I approve of Jimmy doing that but it's bs that he doesn't defend the titles
Yes! Yes! Yes!
My god, Finally 🔥 🔥
This is the greatest storyline ever
Jimmy uso the nee tribal chief we dont care if he has no titles
This is awesome
Roman Reigns time as champion are numbered now that the bloodline is cracking
Long time waiting man nice Job usos
Storyline of the year by a longshot!
I honestly though Jey would to the 2nd kick, we finally got what we wanted tho
Roman had that coming since he antagonized Jimmy more than one occasion before NOC. Jey is in another tight spot again since Sami hit Roman with that steelchair and Jimmy mostly kicked Roman in defense of Jey
The best part is Jimmy USO kick Roman reigns face and Jey USO did the say! I think this the end of The Bloodline.
I like Jimmy's Actions To Stop Roman Reigns' Stupid Behavior.
The “I got you!” was Jimmy giving Jey’s superkick to Roman since he couldn’t do it himself. I love that.
This is why the Bloodline kept winning. Bloodline is only weak to Bloodline.  It's like Dragon type in the first Pokemon.
I saw this coming a while ago although, I thought it’d be Jey who would snap but He seems to be the glue holding the Family together, 👊🏾🇳🇬🇺🇸
Cody was right!!! We wanna see the downfall of the bloodline!!!
I told y'all Jimmy Would turn on Roman
The super kick heard around the world !!!!!!!!!
yeah
The Earth shook tonight
¿Por que el vídeo dura 5 horas? I love this..
YEEEES
Just beautiful… fall of Roman
“I GOT YOU!”  brother’s keeper
DOWN SINCE DAY ONE
That 1000 day celebration on smack down is about to hit a little different now 😂.
That I got you hits deep ❤. But I been saying this since day one, if anyone is going to dethrone Roman it HAS TO BE JEY!! There is no one else that makes sense to do it
Wait so when was this?
Jimmy says that’s f####### it I’m sick and tired put up with his bs I should’ve done that longtime ago so f#### him
I ain’t get to watch NOC but I love to see things like this happen.
So glad this finally happened. 🎊
YEAA JIMMYYYY i love roman but bro was treating his own family like dog over a few titles....serve3s him right and i hope sami n ko won,
YES YES YES 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally! Some retribution! Lezzggooo Uce!;;
Jimmy usos a lot of courage and stopped being a slave to his cousin Roman Reigns who always wanted help to stay as Undisputed Wwe Universal Championship because alone and he couldn't handle Stealing without manipulating his cousins ​​physically, emotionally and psychologically... If it wasn't You "The Usos" Jey Usos & Jimmy Usos Roman Reigns alone would not be able to remain as Universal Champion and even the WWE Championship would not pass even the first defense with both belts, Different from you "The Usos" Jey Usos & Jimmy Usos you're there every wwe show your cousin is there every ten shows a week he's only there one or two and once in a while two or three premium live events and then he's out for two months...I respect the ones more The usages that were present in the weekly shows than Roman reigns himself... But the wwe needed Top Babyfaces Tag Champions and I hope they have more top babyfaces on the mid card besides seth freakin rollins because you can see that the wwe is bloated with overly unnecessary heel fighters ⬆️☝🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Bout time
finally dream come true!
I’m not buying it. The bloodline is known for fooling everyone. Remember Jey fooled us and now it’s Jimmy’s turn. This is a set up to get Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn right where they want them and that’s to win back the tag team titles.
Let’s go uso 🎉
I wish jey superkicked him too
Considering Roman Reigns ego & mistreatment of The Usos recently this was bound to happen .👍🏽
“I’m doing what you should’ve done a long time ago”
It's gonna be roman & solo vs the usos
While I knew this was going to happen from the beginning it still was awesome to see it!
Dammit I was hoping Jey snapped and they hit the "1D"
classic
How to get cheers from fans? Just superkick the head of the table lol. Roman...acknowledge the cheers buddy.  0:09  0:52
A three year storyline and it’s still amazing
I knew it was going to come to this the moment Roman reign said to Jimmy you going to obey me You don't say that to a grown man like that not to get your head knocked off
niceeeeee
They didn't even seem to care that they kicked Solo in the mouth! 😂
now watch romans next match againts brock lesnar or somebody he gonna lose cause theres no more usos
What just happen😱😱😱.
Looooooong over Due!!  Tha Roman Empire has fallen...
Yeahhhhhh get em Jimmy!!!
The bloodline is the end na na na hey hey hey GOODBYE
Lo mejor para los negocios 😎
Ayo tell me why this lowkey was emotional 😭 😅
The biggest swerve here is that it was Jimmy who pulled the trigger. Everyone was like.. Jey gonna turn on Roman, Jey gonna turn on Roma..! Jimmy dropped him like a sick beat 🤯
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
You see the way Jey just stood there. Man is going through a lot of trauma man💀🥲
GOOD Roman got what he deserved
Long overdue !!!
Poor Jey.  How much more betrayal can he take?
FINALLY IT HAPPENED
WOW!!!😮😮😮
long time coming , solo have a choice to make
"Listen to me, Uce. I'm doing what you should've done a long time ago.  I got you."  I love this story.
Wow....just wow 👌
Jimmy is the real Tribal Chief now. He's the upcoming Main Event Jimmy. We acknowledge you Jimmy!
THANK YOU JIMMY
Finally!!!!! 😁😁
*I wanna see a Last Man Standing match now!*
Jimmy relief and Paul like noooooo what u doing.  jey Just standing there conflicts can't wait for Paul to say something like that was an assassination attempt on your tribe chef
Finally!
Finally  yesss
THANK YOU JIMMY THANK GOD
Successfully Betrayed Family 💔💔💔
Honestly, he deserves it, he deserves it. Also they should I listen to Sammy🎉
Can't wait for smackdown on Friday
No offense....this should have happened in the states...it would be a better reaction
Thank you I been waiting a long time for that it's been a long time coming. Now it's Jey turn Sami changed the game 😂
Happy 1000 Day and break up with Jimmy uso I don't know what happened next
Like i said before, they didn't need roman, roman needed them
I wonder what got a bigger pop? Sami hitting Roman with the chair or Jimmy doing the super kick?   Also I had figured Jey to do it so this was a nice surprise.
This is cinema
I enjoy Roman but the USO’s have been it for me the last year I love watching them.
Next thing you know he will slap solo soon hes had enough. Samoan spike coming for roman.And the undisputed titles are gone soon as the next money in bank cash in happens.Roman only won the titles and kept them because of the usos always helping.Then i think roman will turn on heyman.Which we all know who will come to rescue heyman.But who knows this storyline was gold but id love to see jey win the undisputed champions that be gold
At this point, if Rhides gets his rematch against Reigns, Jimmy has to help him, too.
Jey gonna kick Roman soon & be happy asf after it & relieved
The best storyline I’ve seen in wwe in well over a decade. I’d put it up there with the HBK/HHH/Undertaker saga.
Y E S !!!!!
i dont know how i can thank jimmy😂😂😂😂
Jimmy is the person we always see cheerful.  But when he was angry, he was the first to attack.  We all expected Jey to strike first.the same thing happen when sami betray the bloodline
Jimmy is going to lose to Roman at Sunmerslam.
Got to love the story line jey leave the bloodline comes back for Jimmy them Jimmy drops Roman and say I am doing what you should of done a long time ago but will jey leave Roman now because he couldn't do it before
epic!!!! now when the triabl chief goes to Italy, he can't just roman reigns all over the place as he pleases. He will have to watch his back
He should've beat him into a pulp. 😏
“I got you use!” That was tight
Back then Jey saved jimmy from roman's attack  Now jimmy saved the Usos from roman's abuse.
Greatest moment in the history of this sports entertainment.
Get a doce of your own medicine 💊. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's what I'm talking about
Maaannn jimmy said he had enough. It’s his time in this story
About time
The bloodline breaking up is better then the shield breaking up don't you agree
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!
Roman deserved that Super Kick for Good, that's the Script said...
This was so predictable since what happened on Smackdown and last few weeks, finally and thank god Bloodline is over
A few years back Roman and Jay USO had a feud. They fought at Hell in a cell and Clash of the champions. Jay didn't give roman the fight he wanted. But Jimmy USO will. SummerSlam roman Reigns vs Jimmy USO undisputed champion match that's gonna be good
The drama
The debut of Sokoa Sami becoming a superstar, Heyman doin Heyman The Usos rise to main event.   As a tag team at that, Roman becoming GOAT.  The Bloodline story and everyone involved, had elevated so many wrestlers on the roster.
En efecto esto es cine 🚬
Its been a loooooong, long time coming,  but i knoooowoowooooo.  Change gon come.   😂😂😂😂😂😂
드디어 블러드라인 분열이구나 ㅋㅋ
The fallen of bloodline 😂😂😂
The Usos are about to have the greatest face run the rest of 2023
Best ever brothers for life
" you not gon hit him "  " Why? "  " COZ I'MA HIT HIM!!!!!!! "
Jesus Christ ....this hurt me watching at home!!! I literally said noooooooo wtf jimmy wtf.. SMH I'm so pissed the bloodline is falling apart
This is why WWE will always be the top company. When they deliver its epic
Que bien que bajaron de sus nubes ha roman reigns por que el siempre gana con trampas y ayuda el que si no me gusto que perdiera es bianca belair ella siempre ha sido una campeona honesta no como asuka tuvo que recurrir a las trampas para ganar el título
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
And now we will think back and remember Brock Lesnar was the true greatest 😂❤
Poor Jey.. Traumatized again..
And I thought Dominik Mysterio betraying his dad was surprising
Yes Roman reigns suck
The end of the bloodline  finally 🐵
DA BLOODLINE IZ BROKEN!!!!!!!
Jey finna have major ptsd 😭 “We don’t do that, we gotta be better than that.”😭😭 He just want a happy bloodline🤣
Words cannot explain how happy I am that this happened  It needed to happen 😊😊😊😊
FINALLY
Saw that coming before the match.
"I got you!"
Roman sold the HELL outta that second super kick.
this is cinema.
Yessss
Yes yes yes yes yes thank you uce
I’m glad that the usos slowly transitioning to face
The best long term storyline since kane n undertaker
It's the ROAR after the second super kick for me... I felt it in my soul.
He did it for the rock
love it I acknowledge he got his teeth damn near kicked out his mouth
Spectacular!and I'm so glad it was Jimmy.
I guess Roman wasn't "FEELING UCEY"? This storyline might not get topped for quite a while, if ever. Simply amazing!!
Let's go Jimmy ❤
Sami was right haha
Cinema!
THIS IS CINEMA 🎥
Good
The moment I've been waiting for Jimmy uso versus Roman
That scream he let out was months of visceral emotion
I knew this was coming
I love that with Jimmy: I AM DOING WHAT YOU SHOULD OF DONE A LONG TIME AGO I GOT YOU  Showing that no matter what i got you bro we aren't taking this no more
Honestly I though Jey would the first to do so
I honestly didn’t think they could make this any better but they have. I truly see Jay finally reaching his breaking point and costing Roman the belts at Summer Slam
A Historical moment that will be talked about for years to come
Damn jimmy on fire💥💥💥
This moment got me like 😳
Boring
I think it goes without saying but.  Usos Babyface turn confirmed.
Hi there what's up 😍😍😍😍
best part if night of champions
Crazy Face Turn,....
Dope
Its time to end the bloodline storyline.  It was bound to happen sooner or later
Wwe tells dis to Roman he deserves it and I will knock you out
Bruh I saw this coming from the beginning, but it’s still way too satisfying ☝️☝️☝️
let’s gooooo
I want Jimmy's head!!!!!
Love it
finally 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Acknowledge me!!!! Okay Bannng!!!! 😂😅
Epico....
I KNEW IT 🙉🤣🤣🤣🤣 it's over super kick twice go to sleep Roman
I think they should have done this to cause Roman’s main titles. It’s going to be much better to the segment. What do you guys think? 🥶
Most Shocking Moments in 2023
Because Jimmy is Hard enough
Jey is a real one
That second kick has cemented Jimmy's future with the Bloodline. And the way Roman just flopped out the ring afterwards was just perfect.
watched this live on peacock, and I can say that I hated watching it more the second time.
The fact that it has come full circle to this moment is really a testament to his good this bloodline story has been.
Good for a storyline but maybe this shouldn't have happened, I mean the bloodline held it down as the best while they did and they being family made it even better
Good choice
This definitely out shone the heavyweight championship earlier..come Smackdown..1000 days celebration is gona be interesting, Jey's turn to turn on Roman...
The first kick was for his brother , but that second kick was for him
LMAOOOOO
The Bloodline storyline is pure cinema.
Jimmy's rating on 2K next year 93 OVR UCE
😮 he sounded relieved but conflicted at the same time should he have done that I don't know but I feel bad for Naomi Roman Reigns do the provider of the family he does his work as well but Roman put him on not at the beginning of course
Mean while ppl watching Jersey shore n exc.. Man Wwe where it’s at story telling fights n the bloodline! let’s go triple h!
"I'm doing what you should have done a long time ago!" Beautiful! Absolutely beautiful! I wasn't expecting the betrayal at Night Of Champions but I'm certainly not mad at it.
You love to see it.
It’s about time 😂
Worst thing about this is that we have to wait all the way until next Friday to see what happens next.
Jajaajajajaajq bien caraj..
Longterm booking is the way to go i hope someway wwe can continue this with all bloodline members and keep itt going its a hit 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Roman had it coming
First kick - dont mess with my brother  Second kick - screw you roman we quit
Good job jimmy
Finally!!!!
😮 for Naomi how is he going to provide for his family now that they're out of the family
Also it’s the small touches they add to this. Paul’s reactions always help. Then Jey yelling Joe at the end was perfect. Subtle but gold
I wonder where Solo stands in all this
Wonder which uso is going to take the titles off roman. Its clear as day hes going to lose the title's to an uso
This what we call..  *"EMOTIONAL DAMAGE"*  😅
“I’m doing what u should’ve done a long time ago” it was all worth the wait 🌹
I did it for the rock
0:09
The moment when Jimmy said "I got you" was everything
😮 at this moment he knew he f***** up
Jimmy did what everyone thought jey would do
It’s about damn time
That was COOL..
😮 oh that is not good those boys have screws themselves well at least one of them out of the family
Yesss! Jimmy is the man!!!
About damn time!
MAIN EVENT JIMMY USO
“I’m doing what you should have done a long time ago”… Daaaamn straight
No way this isn’t the best storyline in wwe history. The layers and depth to this is wild. It’s so many twist and turns but they all make sense. This is awesome
It's about time one of them turned on him
El fin de Bloodline, como debía de ser, ver como golpean al Bultazo tribal
Jimmy did the right thing don’t act surprised
LISTEN TO ME UCE! LISTEN TO ME! LISTEN TO ME UCE!!  I'M DOING!! WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE!! A LONG TIME AGO!! I GOT YOU!!  Then Baaam!! The Drama is everything here man!! awesome Storytelling
👍🏼
FINALY !!
0:01 certified classic moment 0:14 the meme
That’s how WWE build its superstars. Put them into one big and good faction, then blow them up while having character development in each members separate path.
not the bloodine
Jimmy did what a big brother pose to do. It was messed up they still left they baby brother tho but this is excellent writing
I'm doing what you should've done.. a long time ago... I got too...
Ive said it since survivor series when its all said and done this can go down as the greatest wwe stroyline ever
Finally, finally, jimmy Jay was never going to do it but I’m glad he did it
This was nothing short of perfect. Without the Usos, Roman's days as champion are numbered. The Island of Relevancy is sinking into the sea, and the Head of the Table will soon lose his crown without his precious Bloodline.
Y'all can have Jimmy super kicking Roman.... Paul's facial expressions are always what gets me 😂.
Finally usos man up …
The Bloodline storyline STILL on its peak!
Roman deserved it
I love the fact that Jimmy didn’t do anything when Roman was in his face but has soon has Roman was in Jey’s face shoving it all bet’s were off for Jimmy
Genial :v ya era Hora
And this is why he has a special handshake with Sami
It was 'bout time
Bloodline is over l
Jimmy got GUTS to finally do this to Roman… about Damn time!
One of the best storyline 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Well at least one had a set!!!!!!!!!LOL
YEEEEEES
Jimmy really disappointed me 💔 he suckkkk !!! I give all the credit to roman reigns all he wanted was to doing it on his own along with solo
The Bloodline will be disbanded.
Jimmy is the goat bro
Yesir finally the Usos step up. This is what I’ve been waiting for a long time
Aye roman's selling to the second kick tho
The kick heard round the world is what ended the bloodline
I only wished he got super kicked more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bout damn time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Paul’s reaction is priceless 🤣
WOW.😮😮 Never expect it. I guess Roman was pushing them way too long. Jimmy wanted to do it and kick him twice. My guess is that Jey and Solo might make a choice between Jimmy and Roman on one of the Smackdown episodes.
The End of the Tibal Chef. This is Awesome
Definitely doing down as one of the greatest storylines in history jimmy is no longer Romans slave the only reason jimmy stayed in the bloodline was because of Jey in the first place
When i saw the first super kick and roman got up i thought jimmy was a dead man but the secoand was o dead man kick for roman never
Good do it again
It was bound to happened but didn’t expected jimmy the one to turn on joe
I was waiting for Jey to super kick  Roman to 😂
Cody must be so proud somewhere as he was the one to predict fall of bloodline after he successfully got Sami and KO along.
This will go down to history.
Remember when Jey said that he was asked "which one are you?" For years we couldn't tell them apart, now they don't even look like twins. The hair and faces are completely different. When the time comes, I wouldn't mind them being pushed as huge singles stars. This is the time to do it while the new talent is developing.
Who's the tribal chief now??? 😀😁😆
🗣️I’m Doing What You Should’ve Done A Long Time Ago. Words can’t describe how Jimmy feeling right now.
Jimmy has just just changed the story. What a classic!!
It's unbelievable, this confirms what i have said since months ago, it's a betray
family storylines are always so fking satisfying
I saw this coming I knew this was gone happen
The pride the fire Thank you Jimmy!!
Sami Zayn: Royal Rumble! Now Jimmy Uso: Night Of Champions!
MADE MY DAY 😂😂
Yesyes isn't children Roman
As if the bloodline saga wasn't great enough.  Here they come with even more. I am loving this saga. And ya mind blowing for sure. This episode killed it... and ya they definitely sell it. Love these guys... ❤
I love that. Can't stop smiling
Thanksgiving is going to be interesting at the Uso home this year…
Roman you deserve it!🤪
IM Doing What You Should've Done A Long Time Ago!   DAMN Jimmy
This was perfect story telling thank you triple h for the amazing story
Oh no this is bad
I thought this would of happened at WM this past year. Better late than never I guess
Moral of the story is have a backbone stand on your own two.
the usos need to be the ones to take the titles off roman that would be an amazing ending to this story
BEST STORY LINE EVER
Đả dì đâu
F grade
From chair shot to superkick.
Main Event jimmy!
Am I the only one that rewatches every Bloodline segment multiple times to take in the expressions and reactions of everyone including Heyman? They all do fantastic background acting.
one of the best endings to a ppv ever i loved it
" IM DOING! WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING! A LONG TIME AGO! I GOTCHU!" (Then airforce one to face the face of Roman)   wow! Lol classic
It is certainly and certifiably "on" now.
About time. The bloodline is over. Roman is nothing but selfish.
I have been waiting for an eternity for this!! 🖤👏
Jey looking stupid now. After all this they suppose to kill roman
now the downfall of bloodline, jimmy would win the universal title and jey will win the wwe title
I’m not mad at Night Or Champions at all🔥💯
Damn chief you be aight lmao 😂😂😂
Top momentos mas satisfactorios de la historia  No.1 0:52
I don't watch much wrestling anymore, but I've watched this story from the start, and this has been superb throughout. Reigns winning at Wrestlemania doesn't look so bad anymore.  Superb again from all involved. Jimmy turning, Jey conflicted, Roman selling. This is a once in a generation story. Enjoy it.
This Is Karma......and you know what they say about karma man I feel sorry for all Roman fans.....just kidding I don't haha
Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
i like this movement 😮
NOOOooOoOoOo Poor Román 😩 everyone betrays him
Whoa
first
What’s crazy is that This all started at Clash Of Champions 2020 and now it ends at Night Of Champions 2023 RIP BLOODLINE 2020-2023
Roman when the usos go there way Roman gonna hire the Authors of Pain to handle the Usos
It's best for bizness
jimmy has the right to do it cause i dont want see punk cousin like that. i will do the same
About damn time.
That's right!
In the beginning, we didn't expect this to come from Jimmy.
Rishiki smiling somewhere, I tought him that " I did it for the ROCK"
Nearly threw my phone with excitement 🔥🤣 we was waiting fa this, big bro finally took charge and stepped up🤣🤣
Only if this was in Puerto Rico
YES YES YES !!!!
Jey stayed to protect jimmy and jimmy betrayed Roman to protect jey. Damn this is good.
The bloodline war start for here
Roman sitting there acting just waiting to get kicked in the head
Oh wow! I didn't see this classic WWE betrayal coming 🙄
They just follow the script, nothing real in wwe
OMG, Finally!
Hell to effing Yeah! So damn satisfying, gratifying, and self rectifying... RIGHTEOUS! CLASSIC!
And Roman did the same thing that the Usos did they put it on Roman and lost the match and couldn't get the job done then Roman put the match his father and his family and he still didn't get the job done either so now Roman needs to be the one to Apologize to his family for putting that match on them when his team didn't even win so Roman needs to apologize for putting that match on his family but i knew the usos wasn't at home i kept saying over and over way before the match came i was like man bro there's no way the Usos was gonna miss a wwe event like night of champions i knew they would be there Because i knew Roman team was gonna lose because it wouldn't make any sense for him to win because he's a part timer champion so that wouldn't have been fair towards all the other tage team's if Roman team had won that today but thank god for jimmy turning on Roman that gave Kevin and sami the advantage and they did it all on there own too and before there match sami was complaining to kevin that there title run would have ended today but kevin told sami before there match that he didn't go threw all this just let go of what they worked so hard on achieveing and i can tell sami and kevin they liking this title run with each other and so am i. And i like there title run so far better then the Usos title run i hope sami and kevin gets the push they need to carry them Undisputed tag team champions Because they came a long way just to get those tage title's they both really did and i hope they stay champion's because i like them together as champion's!💯❤
OMG THIS WAS A GREAT ❤
The Best storyline with soo much life lessons,things that happens in family and around us. Thank you WWE we learn as we’re entertained too 🥳🎉🎊  One day my dream will come true to wathc the show live at the grandest stage of them all. WWE Forever
"Im doing what you should've be done a long time ago" those words really hit
About Damn time
This is the reason why I love WWE
I can't wait to see Jimmy vs Roman
Whoever came up with the bloodline in the first place deserves to be in the Hall Of Fame themseleves.
Wow
Everyone's thoughts: "IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME!"
This storyline is up there with the greatest honestly.
Im glad Roman lost. Now the titles
This was a 🔥moment
The shiled will return
Jimmy: superkicks Roman  Roman: so you have chosen death
Yeahhhhhh no more tribal cheat.
Summer Slam we have a problem!!!!!
Paul Haymen : I gona take long vacation after this....need to come up with new storyline...
Jey forgive but Jimmy never forget
Jey vs roman at money in the bank I'M CALLING IT NOW
ITS BEEN WAYYYYY TOO LONG SINCE IVE REACTED SO HYPE ABOUT SOMETHING WWE!!! THIS WAS CHEFS KISS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That was crazy. That was this absolutely crazy. I knew that Jimmy and Jey Uso would turn on Roman reigns. I knew it all along a someone need to explain on Monday night. I’m just totally shocked what I just seen. I went right through the roof. Roman reigns, have some heavy explaining to do against Jimmy
Sniffs..... And it was in that moment the Usos became awesome again. 😭😭😭😭😭
That’s the type of ending we’ve all been waiting for. Emotional drama works!
That is good for the asshool Roman
I like how they are doing this it’s like Jey will be the last to betray Roman
Finally
THE KICK HEARD AROUND THE WORLD
Should've done it a long time ago.......🎉🎉
So good
Now, this storyline makes more sense. Roman Reigns repeatedly, abusing the Usos brothers who were doing his dirty work and helping him retain his championship, finally, they had enough and turned on him. What would make it better is if they helped Roman Reigns lose his undisputed Universal Championship.
0:48 Jimmy tell Jay should have done during Royal Rumble 2023 instead Samy Zyan take a chance
Think the USos had enough of Roman they now face I hope as I love the USos
Holy s**t😱😳I thought it might be Jimmy first cause it’s more unexpected Jey was usually the defiant one but damn that will stick with me for life hell yeah 😂👍
After tonight there is no more doubt the bloodline will come to its end
Soon Roman gonna lose his titles
Give Jimmy USO a chance against Roman reigns
Im doing what u should have done a long time ago
Woooooooooh
Omg
Nobody: ...  Jimmy Uso: Let me do it for you...
You see Jey face he was actually smiling but wasn’t trying to
It should have been Jey and to hear Jimmy tell Jey "I'm doing what you should have done" is Jimmy high? He was the one that convinced Jey to bow to Roman came out begging and gave Roman all the leverage he needed. And now he has the audacity to say that to Jey nah miss me with that
Same story as Evolution betrayal, Samy Zane betrayal, Usos betrayal, ermm what else??...in WWE brotherhood and family all about betrayal...best legit brotherhood in WWE...Eddie and Mysterio...period..
The best storyline that WWE has produced since the Austin-McMahon rivalry.
My boys
Roman & solo vs Uso's next PPV. Solo turn on reigns. Jimmy or Jey get the pinfall. And finally pins roman after 3 years but he keeps the titles? Everybody comes out strong 🤷🏾 Only if lol
Yes about time yesssssssss he deserve it
Finally!!!! This is The Epic Scene that i wanted all time
As I smell a match between the brothers, notice how Jey basically backed off and let Jimmy kick Roman again without hesitation before Jimmy pushed of course.
I love that its one family just performing and having so much fun together
Acknowledge the Tribal Chief, JIMMY USO!
What is Roman going to do? He can't handle both Usos jumping him. And Solo isn't enough.
That thunderous pop was insane💥
The Pop from the 2nd Kick was wild
Oh, yeah. That was long past due. Roman Reigns have been abusing the Usos brothers for so long, using them to do his dirty work. Finally, Roman Reigns got what he deserved!
the best storyline in years.. great work fellas 👏🏾🔥
Like The Rock says: "FINALLY"!!!!!
Honestly, I'm sad it's coming to an end. The bloodline has been the best thing in wrestling for about 2 years. But this payoff has been too sweet so far
Guess the Bloodline's over.
😮😮😮😮😳😳
When will this storyline end
Yesssss! Finally Man!!!!!!!
Wwe were clearly waiting for roman make it to 1000 days before making this happen
What a beautiful moment 10/10
The Uso got tired of Roman Regins abuse
Jimmy Usos New Tribal Chief When?
I enjoyed this from Jimmy❤❤❤
I don't think WWE can top the Bloodline storyline  its been superb the last few years from the fued with Jimmy vs Roman to the Bloodline formation to adding solo and adding Sami , then Sami flipping on Roman  . The only ways I can see this going a extra mile is if they add Jacob Fatu who is Jimmy , Jey , Solo and Roman other cousin who is a beast in the ring at MLW . Add in Tamina or Nia Jax who is also the cousin of these guys , Nia Jax actually got real heat with Roman she cussed him out on Twitter and I don't think it got resolved .   The #2 storyline is Cody chase for the WWE title but it dont have that emotional high for me right now , like the bloodline storyline . I just dont see WWE surpassing this and it scary to think at some point it will have to end . But right now im enjoying the ride .
Thank its finally over
Now this is cinema
I remember t Roman Reigns Attack Jimmy Usos at hell in a cell 2020 after Beat brother Jey At I quit match
I didn't even know wwe still existed lol Hella garbage
About time but Jay seen to worry to  attacked roman
A spear would have been great
Its Gonna be No.1 on top 10  shocking moments in year end 2023
Take that Roman pos tribal chump
Thank you JIMMY 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
0:43“Listen to me uce! I’m doing what you should’ve done a long time ago!” Truly cold words from Jimmy 🥶
I felt so happy that the Usos did that
LMFAO "I GOT YOU!"
It's ok for Jimmy to say it but everytime Sami said it to Jey he got punched in the mouth for it.
Finally Jimmy got his time to shine
The look on Jey’s face most definitely said “I wanted to be the one to do that”. Jimmy did it for him 🔥
predictable and boring
Jimmy had enough. I bet he felt million times better getting all that out. Hope Jey woke up, finally. What Jimmy do??? What a older brother does, protects his younger brothers.
Sami Zayn be like right now:  “There’s always a Plan B.”
🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The dissolution of the Bloodline has been the best storyline in WWE right now.  First Jimmy. Now only Jey and Solo remain before Roman is all alone.
Jimmy should do it more early
Man the Bloodline storyline is one of the best storyline that WWE has done
That was hilarious I'm glad Jimmy did what he had to do.
That was crazy!
I actually enjoyed this show...especially Asuka winning
The Usos had enough it. The Bloodline have completely destroyed. Everything is disintegrating right before their eyes.
Finally...the bloodline is over 😂😂
Paul Heyman like 😰
Roman is going to have mental break downs In the coming weeks saying IM THE MAN ITS MY WWE!
I jumped up, clapped & squealed like a 10 year old when he hit him with that first kick😂 then did it again the second time!😂😂
The Bloodline is breaking apart. I know ill end at SummerSlam
I'm 32 years old and was watching is on peacock alone.   Believe me When i tell you I POPPED like i was a kid in the arena once that 2nd kick landed!
I thought Jey was gonna join in and they were gonna do the double superkick that woulda been even more 🔥🔥
Roman is done the bloodline is done and jimmy is a man now
I never expected it to be Jimmy.. jesus.. Reigns 1000 Day Celebration next week isn't looking so good.
Roman reign and the bloodline added a totally different dynamic to what has been a great win for the wwe. Unfortunately I just don’t see where to next for the wwe cos what they have is a bigger problem then most would think…where to next?
Don't worry Jimmy,Dwayne is the real The Tribal Chief...
I'm literally shaking from the adrenaline
Milking it
ya era hora
Handicap match. The usos and entire locker room vs Roman and paul heyman. And stone special guest referee 😂
I…  Hate…  Roman… 🎉🎉🎉
I’ve been waiting for this!!!
Disbanded
Serves roman right from day 1tryma be the head of the table in the bloodline pretty much just bullying and using his cousins to his advantage 🤦🏾‍♂️ cause let's be real here if it wasn't for the Usos ,solo and sami getting involved in damn near all of Romans matches he would've lost them titles months ago Rs 🤷🏾‍♂️💯
Anybody who can't tell the difference between The Usos now needs to have their eyes checked. Should've had them checked since Main Event Jey if I'm being honest.
That was Great!
Finally. Send Roman home. He is not worth watching every week. With the same blah blah blah slow talk.
MAIN EVENT JIM LETS GOOOO
😱😱😱 WTF
Finally
I know what Jimmy's "Listen to me!" reminded me of now. Doctor Octopus when he regained control of his arms in Spider-man 2. Listen to me now!
*The End Of The Bloodline...*
lol and people watch AEW instead of WWE
As a Roman fan and Uso’s fan im hurt.
Wait a minute no when Jay was wanting to kick Romans head off Jimmy was the one stopping and now all of a sudden Jimmy's like I'm doing what you should have done a long time ago all that said I love his storyline
Jimmy is gonna challenge Roman for all 3 titles, both WWE championships & head of the table. Jimmy will be the one to beat Roman with Jey's help. Solo is gonna leave Roman soon after.
The way Roman sold that second super kick 👌👌. Sensational!!
First  we had the punch heard round the world when Rey punched Dominic  now we have  the kick heard round the world. Way  to go jimmy.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I feel like the crowd pop wasn’t as good as it should’ve been because of the location of the show
Roman ego finally got the better of him and he got what he deserves
ITS ABOUT TIME USOS.
The payoff is here. And it is so sweet.
0:43 "LISTEN TO ME UCE,  I'M DOING WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE A LONG TIME AGO ... " 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
BOOKER  BATTING  1000  on  this  one;  every  match  mattered  and  delivered!  Watched it twice back to back!
Finallly the Bloodline may be done for good. It's the same crowd noise when Asmi hit Roman in the back with a chair
omg....
I just love this
JEY FACE WHEN JIMMY CONNECTED WITH THAT SECOND KICK
Nunca me imagine esto de jimmy,pense que el que iba a atacar a roman era jey porque como lo trabata y demas,pero me re somprendio de jimmy
This whole match was just satisfying.  The only thing about the ppv that annoyed me was Cody surviving the Kimora lock for four minutes with a broken arm. 🤦‍♂️ Thats not how it works. 😂
incredible, absolutely incredible
This is mad emotional bro. Jimmy is finally beating down on his brother’s abuser and Jey is conflicted because of Roman’s gaslighting.  I see Jey vs Roman at SummerSlam.
😮😮😮😮
I knew this was going to happen 😂
Yes yes yes 😂
That was future iconic time
"I'm doing what YOU should've done a long time ago!"  This is one of the greatest storylines of all time.
The Bloodline is not ending, it's just about to begin!  It'd be more interesting!  Family Feud!
Yes Jimmy,you are the man💪
Stunning storytelling
Waited so long to see Jay snap on Roman then Jimmy is the one to do so! Epic!
Yes..finally
0:52  Jimmy Uso is the one ☝️   I’d like to see Jimmy have a singles push and I’ve said this for a while
This was even better than when Sami hit Roman with the chair shot! I’ve watched wrestling all my life and this rite here made me feel like it was the good old days! Got me adrenaline pumping! WWE have made some poor booking decisions over the last decade but this Bloodline storyline is a masterpiece!
About Damm time!!!
Look the story telling of it circling right back where it’s first started.
The second superkick is gold. The acting, the way Roman sold it, the rage from Jimmy while doing it.
Those two super kicks were satisfying👌👌👌
Just like Jimmy said. Main Event Jey Uso should've done this when Jimmy intervened after his match with Roman. That was probably the angle they were going for but COVID was going on and no crowd so it would've felt lack luster so they finally went with the Bloodline and then Sami Zayn push happened but man oh man glad they decided to wait even longer to do this! 👏
Crazy fause everyone thought it would be Jey ..... But it was Jimmy instead... This is some of the best work WWE has done in years
Jimmy se canso de roman reigns!!! Jimmy YES!
Jimmy usos words ”I’m doing what you should have done a long time ago” will always stay in my head
I could watch this all day
Bro I don't even watch modern WWE but that pop gave me goosebumps.
He had it coming 😄😄😄😄😄😄
Jimmy spoke FACTS💯  I'm doing what you should of done A LONG TIME AGO🔥🔥🔥🔥
FINALLY!
Big brother jimmy protecting Jey 😂
Pick a lane people....first you say WWE needs long term booking...then when you get it you find every single ridiculous way to turn it into something negative...even when you get what you want you find something to complain about.   Then it's always the usual "attitude era was better" nonsense.....jeez then just go watch that and leave the other people that enjoy watching this in peace lol
Sometimes you gotta show cuz what's up.
It has been a long time coming! Nice one, Jimmy!
Finesse
Okay, now i cant wait on next week smackdown
I GOT YOU BAM WAAAAAAAAA CMMOOOONNN  Was epic
MAIN EVENT JIMMY!
There both In big trouble
The best Twist in WWE
I'll give WWE this, that crowd did pop pretty good...
That's gonna be a WTF top moment i know They should add
The Bloodline is Over!!!!!!!!!!!
The way i was screaming! This storyline deserves every love that it gets!
Best thing ever happen
Who knew in 2023 I would witness the fall of the roman empire, this bloodline story over the last few years has been some crazy wrestling Shakespeare thing, best thing in TV & can't wait to see it live at money in the bank, what a show 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Main Event Jimmy
This has to be the best storyline wwe has made !! I can't wait for Monday night raw!!👏
Roman Sold That Kick 🦵
I bet Brian Last and Jim Cornette just watched and rewatched that exchange and said the best part was the look on Heyman face. No one sells like Paul.
Peak cinema 🚬🚬🚬
Roman been getting under the skin of Jimmy for weeks, Jimmy lost it in  give the Undisputed champion a dose of wake up call.
WHO ELSE STARTED TURNIN UP WHEN HE KICKED ROMAN ⬇️
Good job the Usos and goodbye Roman😂
A perfect example of one of my favorite sayings: A dog is THE MOST loyal creature on the planet. But you're only going to kick a dog so many times, then you WILL get bit. 😂😂😂
wow 😮😮😮😮
RIP the bloodline
The Usos turned heel on The Bloodline.
Awesome shot Jimmy Uso!!! 🖕🖕💯😃🎉
Finally Jimmy snapped been waiting for this
I love it FINALLY should've been done a long time ago
HOORAY!!! The Usos (Jimmy & Jey) are face turn!!! 🖕🖕💯😃🎉🎉
The Tribal Chief gets deserves this.
We thought it was Jey who will superkick Roman but it was Jimmy!!
LETS GOOOO this is so satisfying!!!
BIG 😂😎😂😎😂😎 MY FACE!
0:52 - THE BLOODLINE IS FINISHED!
I never thought Jimmy was the first one to betray the bloodline
Corey: “Jimmy, what did you do?”  Jimmy: “Something that Jey should have done years”
This is Cinema.  Such great storytelling.  I decided to say it, while all of you Doofus Devotees get the lube.  Don’t forget to grab a towel too 😉
Wow
Wow😅😅
Jimmy vs Jey at SummerSlam please!!!
Now jimmy needs to bring his shirt back ain't nobody b****
I'm 34....i grew up during the attitude era,,and the new generation era, I'm trying to wonder,, is the greatest story ever!?
About time!! YES YES YES YES!!!
OOOO URE 🤣
Roman sold those kicks like a boss
He had it coming
Ay por favor si todo estaba planeado para que pasara eso todo está planeado como si fuera una película sabía que iba a pasar esto que uno de los usos ya no iba a querer estar con Román rey ahora que sigue el que traiciona o roban ring la tenés que pelear con uno de los usos disque hermanos
Kick him again
He deserves it. The only member of the bloodline that ever deserved to be the tribal chef was Jimmy Uso
I can’t feel bad for Roman because he knows how Jimmy is yes Jimmy and Jey may be twins but they are different l. It only took 3 weeks of disrespect from Roman for jimmy to snap it’s taking jey 3 years.. Roman was asking for it. No one should be surprised that Jimmy pulled the trigger go back to 2020 jimmy never took disrespect from Roman lightly… NEVER.. he only joined because he wanted to be with jey and jimmy was willing to sacrifice maybe himself if that meant getting jey out of this abusive cycle with Roman
Finally I can watch wwe I was so bored of Roman being super G but now I can say it’s getting better
YES TODAY IS THE BLOODLINE EXTINTION. >:3
Only thing that could have made this better would have been for solo to stop them then grab part time champion by the throat and Umaga his @$$ to oblivion.
Sami Zayn… the master strategist for The Bloodline’s downfall
Main Event Jim USO!!!!!!
Jimmy's scream at the end was DEEP
Yh bloodline down
The end the bloodline
Should have made the bloodline win the tag titles and have the usos vs Roman and solo as the way they turn
Ya era hora que se revelaran😅
It was time for that storyline to end anyways
wow i completely expected Jey to turn on roman NOT JIMMY cant wait to see what happens next🔥🔥
Bros got to stick together once again is what i see ,they was forced to the team by losing to roman but together they can leave the team
Haven't seen a payoff to a storyline like that in WELL over a decade. Kudos, that's how it's done. Only reason I even wanted to watch NOC.
Yess yess yess
I saw that coming a mile away
👏👏👏👏OMG... AWESOME! It's been a long time coming.... it sure has, way to go Jimmy!👏👏👏👏
I knew it! I knew Jimmy was gonna snap! I love being right!!😮
Finally
Jimmy: i did what you should have done long ago! 👏👏👏👏👏
Boy that felt good
Kenny omega and the young bucks are best: 😮‍💨
Certified hood family classic.
0:09 0:51 Finally  Get him Jimmyyyyyyyyyy!
Jimmy hit the kicks. But Jey is still THE story in this whole thing. Everyone else including Sami have just been sidekicks.
Jimmy vs Roman mitb10/10 match that needs to happen
Talk about the kick heard around the world.
The kick heard round the world
Why they have jey acting like a lil bihh.. when he was a badass a while back.. he was conflicted with Sammy.. now Roman 😆
Jimmy USO is definitely the real Tribal Chief
LISTEN TO ME!!! LISTEN TO ME, UCE!!! I’M DOIN’ WHAT YOU SHOULD’VE DONE A LONG TIME AGO!!! I GOT YOU!!!
Oh that was AWESOME!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Hell yeah jimmy uso
Top 10 anime betrayals
Cena was right about Roman being able to spread energy to everyone involved with him gotta acknowledge that fr
Yep I knew that was coming lol
I acknowledge my tribal chief, JIMMY USO!
Awesome!
It’s ashame it’s been going on this long I think it’s completely garbage I grew up watching the attitude area and I’m so thankful thank u Vince this storyline now a days I’m sorry just sucks no creativity at all
Rikishi should be the special guest referee for a potential Bloodline civil war between Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa vs The Usos
The look on Paul Heyman's face with his lip poked out was almost as good as the 2 superkicks 😂!
Ohhhhhh here we friggggin go!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
as much as i love the saudi crowd, this should've happened in america at an event like summer slam
Instead of going after the tag titles and *LOSING* Roman should've just put his undisputed universal championships on the line. Now look at this The Bloodline is slowly crumbling down to the ground in front the whole world.
Jimmy just became the biggest baby face in the company
Finally, i have been waiting for that kick for so long. Feel so satisfying, though should have come from Jey.
Families always fight🤷🏾‍♂️
Enough is enough
The pure excitement that ran through my veins when Jimmy did that super kick. TOP TIER
Jimmy big bro awaken and said i had enogh finally he took action and stop roman non scens
Finally!!
But the problem remains: if they were going to do this less than two months after WM then they should've just put the title on Cody.
Honestly one of the Usos should be the one to dethrone Roman, they have been amazing. I don’t care which one. They’re both great.
WTF?!😮 It's now termination! Night of Champions is now being tawnished and turned into termination
Roman said there wasn’t day one anymore, jimmy said hold my earrings I gotchu bro
SIMPLY AMAZING
Knew it the Bloodline is no more and the Usos are faces now and will leave the Bloodline
0:53 O...M...G😂😂😂
I love this slow build. First sami at royal rumble, now jimmy, I’m just awaiting the time jey turns on Roman
Now Jimmy is the TRIBAL CHIEF!
Best storyline in yrs
finally the bloodline is over
Now, the Bloodline is breaking up, Solo is going to defend Roman at first, than he's going to snap at Roman and side with his brothers. Solo challenges Reigns and wins the titles.  Solo is your new Tribal Chief, book it!
This should have happened in a real wrestling town. That  pop was small
That was awesome that should have happened a long time ago Roman deserved it!!!
I told ya, roman dug his grave and he is gonna be all alone by himself and lose his titles
Cinema/10
Just some very poor creative writing by WWE..
Jimmy. I want to say something. Are you a real tribal chief 🤴? Will you defeat Roman Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion?
Oh well deserved  never treat ya family like a pawn u will be chinccheckmate uso style
LETS GOOO!!!
The look on Jimmy’s face said it all. Him coming back to watch his brother Jey get manipulated by Roman and then having to put up with his ego since 2020. Jimmy been wanting to do that for the longest period of time
That was so good it sent shivers down my spine.   The best part was the twist. Having Jimmy do it instead of Jey is brilliant for Jey’s story. Now he’s seen 2 people in his life that didn’t stand Roman’s abuse. So when the time comes for him to finally stand up for himself; you know it’s gonna be glorious!
My respect for Jimmy right now: 📈📈📈📈
Adrenaline rush .. Jimmy just nailed it .. Roman sold it like a pro Uoss
I am my brother's keeper! 💯💯
Roman has reached a level no one has reached since the attitude era, he’s at that point where everything he touches turns to gold, cena didn’t even reach this type of mode. Him and the bloodline are incredible.
finally..
Bloodline storyline is carrying wwe so hard rn. I love it!!!
Tears loved every second this was marvel avengers level wow! Jimmy Jey its your time. You have surpassed tag team belts. You know what belt im talking bout. This was amazing!
“Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three.”
Good job E
Happiness! After months it’s finally happened!! bloodline is FINISHED!!!!!!!
kick for you troble chief match
The stories and build up have been excellent
The best storyline in professional wrestling in the last 15 years, nothing else comes close to this!
Tribal Chief who?
Hell yeah 😂 this is the moment we all waiting for
This story line has been the best
When Jey saw Jimmy superkick Roman, his reaction was the same reaction when Sami hit the Chair Betrayal.
Finally!!
Oh, boy!!! That's something I assumed Jey would have done, but Jimmy doing it is something that will forever be etched into WWE classics. It is such a gratifying moment. Roman had it coming.
FINALLY🎉🎉🎉🎉
I think it was correct time as roman attack both jimmy and jey at night of champions 2020 when he wrestle  jey🎉🎉
Finally
"Joe!!" We are so freakin' lucky and definitely undeserving to be witness to such art.
Sami has been right all along
Jimmy USO is here!
Okay this was awesome! 👏🏼
I have watched the evolution of Roman Reigns and The USOs over the past 7 years. This is by far the best story build up I have ever seen. That 2nd super kick with that primal scream of all Jimmy’s anger this whole time being pushed down.
I waited a long time for this. This is the beginning of the end of the bloodline.
Now I guess u can say the bloodline or whats left of em heh has a uso problem
About damn time!
Epic storyline. Now nobody to protect Roman from Cody. Cody should beat Roman and Solo in a handicap match for the belts.
so rikishi will come back or is it the rock and promote some movie
Is this a re run ?
Undrataed lor chris 😂😂😂
Best storytelling in WWE history. RIP Bloodline
He made his brother Quit by choking jimmy out. So now this is quite fitting and satisfying. Thank you Roman for not leaving wwe after wrestlemania
usos is turning baby face  that super kicked is damnn good
That scream at the end said alot
Woow 😀
"He's our cousin, You are my brother" is what this says to me. Great story telling 🎉
Yeah roman i don't care who you think you are you don't talk or treat someone's brother like that you sorry piece of trash
Jimmy Uso had enough of being pushed around by Roman Reigns
Thank you Roman and Heyman. For making Jimmy and Sami legit today. Without this storyline they wouldn’t be this interesting 😊
But still Roman dude may hold the titles for 2000 days watch the space.
To think after all roman vs jey at HIAC it took till all this for jimmy be the out man, again. 😅 Roman  sure as hell didnt learn his lesson after he did that at Sami.
It was the best omg moment, but was too late to soon
Watch. Roman coming in Thursday. Forgiving the Usos. He’s the tribal chief and he understands the turmoil and given the situations he would’ve done the same. Haha
What a great story telling. Jey got his main event legitimate from covid. Solo is built up to be a monster so now Roman needs to make Jimmy a big deal. Plus roman losing today on his 1000th day reign makes perfect sense. And now this story makes him power hungry for tag titles and taking his cousins spotlights.   This just get better and better.
The SUPERKICK HEARD AND SEEN AROUND THE WORLD 🌍 😮
Jimmy’s primal scream after the fact and Jey just standing their shook  Can’t hate on The Bloodline. Even with things winding down and coming to an end.
Finally!!!!!
When this ends, the USOs turns face..which means the street profits must Join the newly formed hurt business with Omos ii think WWE postponed the reunion until the bloodline crumbled
The end of the bloodline and the manipulative Roman reigns ...
An enthusiastic 👍
Yeessssss unreal! This is amazing the story telling for this is just next level!
JIMMY IS THE HEAD OF THE TABLE!!!!! BOUT. DAMN. TIME!!!!!
I swear Triple H is a better storyteller than half of Hollywood at this point. Let's not forget the Bloodline have been breaking up for over 4 months and each turn still gets a colossal pop
Jimmy finally snapped, down goes the Bloodline..... Jimmy knew , Sami was right
Loved the full circle moment... Roman used Jimmy to get over Jey wayyyyy back when (feels like forever).... best storyline in a long time.
Dame ⌛☝️
Just incredible and a classic moment  Period
I felt that second kick in my soul, the I got you  and that scream at the end was about as pure emotion as I have ever seen in pro wrestling amazing story telling by all those involved.
Wow
Yes this was amazing my prediction came true jimmy uso finally put roman reigns in his place that's exactly what needed to happen love you jimmy uso and your brother ❤️😊😊😊
Honestly just pissed I wanted the bloodline to stay together I wanted reigns and solo to win this just reality but when they get the rematch I hope reigns and solo get the titles!
Man...they definitely gonna talk about this on Friday
Love is 😅😅😅
Đánh hay lắm
Why didn’t they do this with jet
0:09 jimmy what took you so long to kick Roman in the face man finally😂 😆
认同我😢
Aaaaand there goes a million views
Just what Roman sparked himself… pushed family aside and wanted to do everything himself, got too greedy… The USOs were already boiling, steam hot, a Volcano waiting to Burst 💥. Slight moment forgot the USOs came as a pair, took eyes off one… in a blink of an eye…. Jimmy hits Roman*** Jey in shock.
Gotta love the Usos coming to their senses slowly. They might take down Roman with KO & Zayn. Would be great to see. Going out of this whole Story with mutual respect and maybe gratitude that they are now free from Roman.
That  fell good 😂😂😂 FINALLY ROMAN deserve it
Heyman reaction priceless
0:51 Jimmy pushing Jey before kicking Roman was everything.
About time
Long-term storytelling at its finest.
I wonder what The Rock is thinking right now
this is what I was waiting for!
Roman deserve from that super kick 😂
Hope they’re going to have Roman lost the title soon! Get tired of watching him with the title.
I don’t blame Jimmy.
Man many years from now this storyline will looked back amazingly and people will be nostalgic one day as this is one memorable ride
That “I got u” was the chefs kiss!!!!
I'm gonna have to hurry and get home and watch this wrestling event sounds like it was really good and what did I just witness from Jimmy Uso 😮
Jimmy had gutts superkicking Roman Reigns twice
😊
How they made the second kick even better than the first is mind blowing
Ya era hora que se revelaran los usos contra su jefe después de tantas humillaciónes..
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS SIRRRRRRRRRRRRR OH YEA THIS IS THE GREATEST STORY LINE EVER TRIBAL CHIEF JIMMY USO ROMAN DONE BROUGHT OUT THE DOG IN JIMMY AFTER THAT FACE PUSH ON SMACKDOWN LOL
I love me some roman but he had this coming for years but the sad part is  jey and solo will turn on jimmy
“IM DOING WHAT YOU SHOULDVE DID A LONG TIME AGO!!!” My favorite part
Should have happened just after Wrestlemania with Roman loss, but better late than never
I think Jimmy said it best *super kick* "i'm doing what you should've done a LONG time ago" *super kick* just ~chef's kiss good~ the role reversal between jimmy and jey is just beautiful.
Why am i crying??
I already called it since Roman berated The Usos for an impromptu ambushed on Sami and KO. At some point in the family tradition, one member of the family will snap and reach their limit. From the perspective of Jimmy, he reached his breakpoint and finally snaps. Manipulating your own family member for too long will make you reach your breakpoint. Jimmy starts to see Roman's manipulation. I was expecting for The Usos and Solo superkicking Roman in the face, but Jimmy superkicked Roman proved enough. Shattered Bloodline has begun
I guess Kevin Owens & Sami Zayn were right after all…
Ending for Roman Reigns
First SZ with the chair  now Jimmy with superkick to Roman
Those that loved the Bloodline hate this. But me that are tired of the Bloodline, me included, loves this. This breakup of the  Bloodline is long overdue!
We all thought it was gonna be Jey betraying them back in 2022. Glad WWE is being less predictable and keeping this story line must see 👍
Honestly the best storyline ever
It was bound to happen jimmy just had enough
Maybe KO got a point, he really was one of the Bloodline's errand boys.
That was awesome
That was so good.
I loved ever bit of that jimmy and Jey are free now
Man got Dominic betrayal vibes times infinity! 👏😁
Ahora si se puso bueno ❤
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes 💪💪
😢😢 no!!!!!!!!!!!! What
He deserves it for pushing the uso s around
That scream from Jimmy after the second superkick was awesome
In jey usos mind he is thinking your right
Now that was SUPER!!!
Roman deserve that super kick!
Remember a few months ago when we thought it was gnna be JEY who betrayed Roman lol
Himmy Uso
WOOOOO YEAHH BABYYY THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING THIS IS WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT
THE MOMENT HE KICKED ROMAN I ALMOST PASSED OUT. THIS IS THE GREATEST MOMENT OF 2023 NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
Finally!!
Happy Birthday…..JERK!!!
Couldn’t get to watch the ppv, where was Solo in all this?
Yessssss!
....About damn time!!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I love me some Rome, but he's wrong AF at how he's been doing his cousins, The Usos.
Oh yeah and I saw 1 of the comments that said I literally screamed When jimmy super kicked Ronan me too bro
Yes
Roman will lose the championship on the next Pay View .
Sammy zayn was right all along the bloodline has collapsed its over
This storyline has redeemed the WWE.
“I’m doing what you should’ve done a long time ago.” Jimmy never forgot Hell in a Cell.
This is cinema
Everything is now perfect the bloodline has Everything is now perfect the bloodline has now imploded The USOs Have ended a rain that has lasted for 3 years the No jimmy has ended something that has lasted for 3 years jimmy has ended romans winning streak Buy super kicking him and give him Sammy and Kevin the chance to end it with Solo all I can say Is The bloodline is no longer full Together To be completely honest The cracks in the bloodline They were obvious We all knew that Jimmy Didn't give roman the titles it was clear roman Gonna get super kicked When I saw it I dropped on my And I cried Well I didn't cry But to be honest History cannot be restored The bloodline is over and last solo counts But to be honest We Ones More like we are done Because The USOs ended the bloodline for good
It's all crashing down.
He deserves it.
Whoa! I Can't Believe Jimmy Uso just did That... 😨😨
Nooo!
Jimmy Uso is HIM
Best storyline in the history of wrestling.
Bout dam time somebody put the bully in his place
Beautiful
And done with The Bloodline 😅😅😅
Ma endlich....die Story zieht sich schon viel zu lange.....es wird Zeit das Roman abgelöst wird.....
I knew it!! I was right! Jimmy has turned on the big dog!! 😆✊🎉🤜🐕‍🦺
"I got you" - Jimmy Uso
I knew Jimmy was gonna turn on roman reigns but I just didn't want to believe it looks like jimmy had the whole thing planned by himself
WOW! I never thought that it would be Jimmy that pulled the trigger. I always thought that it would be Jey but I guess that also makes sense. Can't wait to see how this story goes from there.
😂⚰  I called it. Knew it would all come to this on day 1,000 of Roman's Lame title reign. Night of Champions was pretty much mid and predictable.
Ufffff how many times i rolled back to see these sweet superkicks.... just beautiful 🫠🤧🥲🥳🥳🥳
Calling it rn but Jey's gonna be the one to dethrone Roman. Bloodline storyline started with Roman vs Jey and its gonna end with Roman vs Jey
Sami and now Jimmy turning on Roman are one the greatest moments in wrestling history!
I am from Korea everybody scream!!!!!!!!!!
Jay uso will pay the ultimate price for this . His disloyalty to the Tribal Chief will be worst than former honorary uso. Betrayal at its highest. The stage is set for one explosive event Jay Uso will crash + burn on this. He is on his own. But maybe he will get some respect if the fight is decent.😂😂
I love Roman reigns matches just for the Paul heyman reactions alone
What!? I can't believe Jimmy pulled the trigger this means the Bloodline crumbles. With the to much abuse Roman Reigns has done to Jimmy and Jay they had enough
USOs the real ones 👆🏻
Jummy Uso has been unleashed.
Jimmy Uso ... The hero we wanted
This is the beginning of the end for The Bloodlines for Roman Reigns and his title run!Roman Reigns the count down and you’re days of being WWE Undisputed Champion is coming to an end very soon whoever wins Money In The Bank someone cashed on you beats you and takes your WWE championship away from you!Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
It finally happened
I predicted it only thing is I thought it would be both of them that kicked Roman
This was not post to happened today the bloodline is imploding
Honestly this should have happened months ago when Jey ditched the bloodline for a few weeks
Imagine if Jey was the one did the second super kick. That would have been nuts.
Jimmy did the right thing that's his brother
Why is night of champion in the day time💀
ONE OF THSES DAYS THIS IS GOING TO BE WWE2K SHOWCASE THIS IS RAW💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
About time.
Roman vs Jimmy at the next PLE.
Emotion on full display
Well done …jimmy finally see that he was wrong all along an now and jay was right the time when he taken on Roman , funny jay it’s the other way around now 🤣🤣🤣 a hope jay have jimmy back ‼️💥
Roman deserved it. About time.
Bloodline is now flat line because that era is dead 😂
This is one of the greatest betrayals I ever seen!
Jimmy said that's strike three. You can't just let another man keep mushing you in the grill. Love the bloodline but this was due. ☝🏾
YESSSSSSSS I hope solo doesn’t come to Romans aid
I told everyone it was going to be Jimmy that changes the game I said it in previous comments 💯💯💯💪🏾
You see the look on Romans face when Jimmy kicked him what do you think he's thinking about what you going to do to Jimmy anyone know? And I love that looking Jimmy uso's eyes like he saying to Roman Reigns like I've had enough of your BS we had enough of you Roman Reigns I love that face Roman made and after the second one priceless and Paul Heyman in the background his face priceless
Instant face turn! Feeling Ucey Roman and Solo?
Good
The bloodline is fallen apart
This was so weak. I hate what they've done to the bloodline🙄😓
I felt that scream frfr
It's about time. I'm sooooo happy. Usos are better as the usos
Wow.. congratulations brother uso`s betrayed the bloodline 👏👏
About the FRAK time!!
This man is like Dj Khaled. ANOTHER☝🏽🤣🤣🤣
That was bliss. Watching Jimmy go Super Sayian after was dope too.
It’s cinema
No way 😳 I im lost for words
Great acting here. I love it🤣🤣🤣
Only thing that could've been better is if jimmy threw in "sami was right"
Oh no I'm guessing Jey will stay loyal so we're gonna have Jey vs Jimmy now aren't we? Come on WWE either do something like the LWO joins the Bloodline so it's like the new NWO or just put an end to this group once and for all
This is beyond epic!
지미가로만을슈퍼킥으로공격이제어떻게된지는알수가없다
Damn. This is literally THE greatest storyline the WWE ever has done for me. So many intricacies and moving parts, but it all works and all so good. Kudos to everyone involved. Chills
Finally!!! It's now Jimmy that pulling the trigger now and realizing first hand!
I never cheered and laughed so hard in my life 😅😂
Yes sirrrrr best story ever
Never thought it would be Jimmy. This is brilliant!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
We all saw that coming and I don't blame you Jimmy
I’m so glad
TERRIFIC!!!!!!!! LET’S GO THE BLOODLINE IS RUNIED!!!! 😂😂😂😂!
I actually jumped up & cheered in my room! Jimmy with the win! But now I see it like Roman is going to annihilate Jimmy & Jey will be forced to fight Solo to save Jimmy, but at the last second Solo & Jey turn on Roman & destroy him
So what’s Jey going to do now? Honestly should’ve had both turn on Roman but they shouldn’t have hit Solo, the whole point is Solo should join his brothers
This is some pretty good story telling best build up since taker and Kane
Jey should have followed up.
This Bloodline story has been on going a couple of years and as a wrestling fan who gave up on WWE A LONG TIME ago, I do check highlights. And just from highlights, this is arguably one of the, if not the greatest story that WWE has put together ever. The twists and turns and just when you know it A, they give you C. And to have Jimmy do the flip on Roman and the primal yell after the 2nd super kick, it’s the small attention to details that makes or breaks a story. And I am sorry. Vince McMahon of today could NEVER come up with anything this long and thought out. And now you just took a one lane highway and gave it 10 off-ramps of material for the future. Brilliant and Roman, while at first during his suffering succotash era I couldn’t stand him, he has made himself into 🐐 talk status just from his heel work. And if I get this all from highlights, I can see why fans that watch constantly are losing their minds.
Yes, yes, yes
Yes!!! Finally
Waited too long for the Usos to betray Roman, it's carried on too long.
''im doing what u should have done a long time ago''
What do you mean, what did Jimmy do? He just destroyed the Bloodline.
Would have been a bigger pop if it wasn’t so predictable
Just think they want to destroy the bloodline to build up Zayn Owens and Rhodes... WWE will be out of business with those 3 clown midcarders trying to carry the banner
It's  about time Jimmy see the light
♥️♟️🎭
Jimmy fights for the title buhh loses badly then jey comes in n win thts how i hope it goes down🤙🏾🤙🏾jey deserves it
When he yelled “I got you”
It was about time
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Everyone was expecting Solo to be the one to turn...Jimmy going first is the brilliant move since he was the one hurt to make Jey side with Roman, and do so reluctantly.  Jimmy and Jey were always the ones saving Roman, then Solo joining to do the same, but not once in this entire saga did Roman help the Usos. At some point, Roman is going to turn his back on the family, first on the Usos and Solo, then on Rikishi, and then the ones who deemed him the Tribal Chief, Afa and Sika, basically saying, "You all are no longer relevant in this family...I am the the One, I am the Tribal Chief, and you all are banished.  The only one in this family that matters is me!" Watch it happen.
Dude this was crazy asf
(Daniel Bryan voice-over): YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
Man...Jimmy busted a nut with that kick.
0:53 😁😁😁😁😁 Yezzirrrrrrrrr!!!!
HIMMY USO THE REAL TRIBAL CHIEF ☝🏾☝🏾
To be fairly honest, Roman had it coming. The endless abuse out of him towards his peeps was too much to bear and it finally boiled over. Good for Jimmy 💯
Jimmy is a traitor. Roman Reigns treated him with respect and this is how he treats him?
FINALLY!!!!!!!!
Y’all Remember when Jimmy ain’t wanna join the bloodline when he came back from injury ?
YES!!! YES!!! YES !!!YES!!! YES!!!
jimmy uso just became legendary !!!
Man i popped huge on that “I GOT YOU UCE!” Final superkick and that primal release he got
I am so happy 🎉❤
What just happened bruh did Jimmy superkick his own cousin?
en la vida no hay que tener miedo esto es probar que no hay miedo
Its official Roman Reigns vs Jimmy Uso
The superkick heard around the world
I feel liked everybody called this to happen…
I got you uso ❤️ that was the highlight of the night
Story got fired up now
They just messed everyone up they thought it was gonna be Jay but flipped nice what a way bring this story to life.
Jimmy is always the one to make the hard decisions, first with Sammy now with Roman
The crowd was waiting for that well done jimmy
The way jey was looking at jimmy when he kicked him again. 👌
Somewhere is Sami zyan:😁
About time
Sammy was right about roman chop the head of the snake  and make a  boots with it
❤ it
Jey acting scary
I always thought it was going to be Jay
CINEMA
I'm glad it's finally over betwen them they could go back to being them
Jimmy should’ve said “since that night in Hell in the cell” because long time ago mean a lot of mean different moments
Woah!!!!!
The whole world knew this was coming
All I’m gonna say is it had to be done, Jimmy Uso was tired of the disrespect
The  tribal chump had it coming to him 😊😁
"🗣I GOTCHU"
Damn that was oddly satisfying.
That was the best thing I've seen all day thank you for the video 👊👋💙
Finally 😂 I've waited so long for this moment, thank you Jimmy Uso 👏👏👏
Awesome!!!!
Good they lost bout time jimmy kicked that pile of garbage in the face
Jimmy new champ
Man Jey don't know what to do or who to trust anymore
Look at the lunatic wise man side of the ring
"I'm doing what you should have done a long time ago!"  That hit hard. Goddamn!
I'm happy that someone finally did what they should've done to Roman a long time ago.
That pop was Crazyyyyy 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Omg
Finally
Cody was right! FINISHED THE STORY!
About time
Now Roman going to lose his titles for sure
It the end for romen
THIS IS WE NEED!!!
The Bloodline died the way it lived.   With a great segment that took twice as long to play out than necessary.
I like it 😅
As Brazilians say, “that was amazing man”
This was absolutely perfect.
Best part of the show
That “I gotchu” was so cold bro. What an event, what a story.
Dat was gud
This was gonna happen we all knew something like this would have happened
Esto es cine ❤
"What are you doing?!" >> Best line ever😂 First to Sami and now to Jimmy! Jey Uso really underrated, interesting to see if the Bloodline implodes completely or they'll drag it out til' next year😜  What am I saying? Of course they'll drag it out😏
And the bloodline is gonna be crippled
This raises a few questions  1. The state of The Usos, who will Jey pick? 2. Sami's involvement in this, if any at all 3. If Jey does pick The Bloodline, who gets The Usos theme?
Usos mad cringe ngl
Who won the tag team championship?
About damn time!!!!! I think HHH has finally come to his senses!!!! I think he’s finally gonna end the bloodline once and for all!!! 🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞
Stuff like this is why WWE will always be head and shoulders above AEW.
I saw it coming
Just when you thought the Bloodline storyline was starting to lose steam and momentum, it gets you hooked again. All of it has been cinema. Kudos to Hunter and everyone involved in the creative bringing this storyline to life. This is legit the best story in pro wrestling right now and easily the best storytelling WWE has done since Punk v Cena.
Ima say it. This whole show was better than Mania🤷🏿‍♂️
YESSSS FINALLY
Brilliant storyline the ending looks good.
Bout timmmeeee (kick his head off) yes now this is WWE
so summerslam is “der untergang” of the bloodline eh? roman should write _mein kampf_ before that.
Wow, the moment  was amazing 👏,   WTG.
I started shaking as soon as he nailed Solo because I knew what was coming next. He's the oldest, so I'm not surprised he made the first move.
Roman Reigns deserved that.
Jimmy: IM DOIN WHAT YOU SHOULD'VE DONE A LONG, TIME, AGO  I hope they go back to black and white
I honestly thought, up until the start of this week, that it would be jey that eventually did it, but I have absolutely no problem with it being jimmy
Even Michael Cole ain’t expect the 2nd one!
0:11 Yup,there’s no turning back  now for the usos
I cheered so hard when it finally hapoened
Cine señores, cine
Volvimos a los viejos tiempos que espectacular ❤❤
Now, that was Ucey
We all knew it was coming but oh my god what a moment, this will go down in history
Roman deserved that, to damn bossy
The fact that Jimmy said I'm doing what you should've done a long time ago...full circle moment
OH YEAHHHHHH!!.. YALL BETTER QUIT PLAYIN WITH THAT BOY JIMMY!!!🔥…. REAL ONE💯☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾
Awesome ❤️
The fact it was two superkicks, one out of instinct…the next to truly cut the ties between the Usos and Roman…god it was perfect.
Trash
About time.
jey is always breaking character lol
At this moment, I was speechless
JIMMY USO IS HIM
Yesssss jimmy
No Regrets Jimmy Uso
It were and was and you can all see it coming 😮😮
Jimmy for WWE Champion
Sami finally got through to them
Jimmy finally coming to his sense now
love this
aluta continua
One of the greatest superkicks we have ever seent. ❤🔥
Them Samoans start screaming and venting rage it's time to get the hell out of town usually!  Hows the head, Roman? Lol.
Royal Rumble 2023: The Chair Shot Heard Around the World Night of Champions 2023: The Superkicks Heard Around the World
when jey said “you’re better than that” i thought he was going to pop him with a killer one
Don't worry Tribal chief. There are some who understand that your career has been built around chairs to your back. What the head of the table has done is unmatched. Sami couldn't hang with the Bloodline so he backstabs and gets praise for it. Roman gave specific instructions he didn't want help from the usos today. Everyone discounts the facts just to jump on a hype train built off twisted memories only showing the bad of the Bloodline and not everything they accomplished together. Sami? Abused? A grown man? Nah. He got elevated and didn't know where he was at. Because of Roman, the tag titles were your main event. Stop d riding the crackheads that are KO and Zayn who got countless opportunities to face Reigns instead of the others in the locker room they care so much about. Could've elevated more people. But you clamored for the same people saying you want change. Explain how that makes sense. Who really deserves that W? Only a select few who can handle what follows such a historic Reign. Ziggler can carry the hype, Orton could've, or Styles could've. Now look what you've done to AJ and the Bloodline. I guess H listened to the trolls for once to see where this goes😂
This is long term storytelling...
Solo n roman x ko n Sami n the usos 3way for the belts watch
Remember when the rolls were reversed and jey was fighting with Roman and now Jimmy perfect story telling
I love what Jimmy did....i just got an amazing feeling when Jimmy superkicked Roman....lolzzz finally 😈😈😉
One of Kishi kids finally whooped that a## 😅😊😂I been saying it was going to be jimmy  the whole time 😊
Am I my brothers keeper..?? Yes I am...
I'm SO happy for this 🎉
The best storyline history of the world wrestling federation
Se veía venir
Bro, Jimmy superkick Roman to the point where he got that man on his knees and rethinking about life.
Absolutely loved it. Main event jimmy NOW!!!!!
Ohh I love watching it over and over again...  May Roman Reigns's reign of terror ends soon!!!
OMG 🤯
finally betrayal
I have never felt such this way even when watching TV shows 😂
That there was a payoff.
HOLYSHYT!!!! 😮😮😮
IM DOING WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE A LONG TIME AGO!!! DONT WORRY I GOT YOU US❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Welp know champion on the line better be Brock Lesnar the Usos is not here so Brock will be champion very long time and listen I think roman is a big fat cheating couse he always need his cousin it's a shame that John Cena didn't win at summer slam
Crazy how full circle this all has come. I just knew light hearted Jimmy would be the one first one to lash out at Roman
Fuxxkkkkkkkk yeaaaa!!!!!!!
For a second I thought they both bout to do a double super kick
COME ON JEY, YOU AND JIMMY NOW LESSSGOOOO
HIMMY USO HIMMY USO HIMMY USO !!! I GOT YOU !!!!!! HE GOT THAT DAWG IN HIM !!
for me this is epic
Well i can finally tell the difference between Jimmy and Jay. Jimmy is nobody's b*tch.😂
Watching Jimmy superkick Roman is the best WWE moment of 2023. 😂
I knew it Jimmy turned on Roman
What Jimmy says to jey in the last part?
I would attack too if I had a psychotic relative pushing me and my brothers.
Roman's nightmare is already happening,  and if he loses that unified title Solo will turn on him for sure
😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧this is it......the end of the bloodline.
Do it five more times!
Yeeess🎉🎉🎉
I knew it was gonna happen! I was patiently waiting for it. Yes Sir!
Yes about freaking time the bloodline downfall has begun
Anyone that has been following this storyline know this was coming because Jimmy never wanted to be in the bloodline. Jimmy just took up for his brother
The end of the bloodline
FINALLY! That fool Reigns will soon learn a very hard lesson about respect! Glad to see Jimmy finally look at Reigns for who he really is!
Jey yelling "JOE" a few times after Jimmy kicked Roman just added so much to the story. Complete chills from all of this. Man Smackdown's going to be a lot of fun.
Only thing that would've made this sweeter would've been if Jey Uso joined Jimmy in that 2nd kick to Roman.
Nice one Jimmy glad you can see what Zayn sees
I've watched this 10 x and still ain't done 😂😂😂 this is 🔥
Roman and Solo should have won. KO and Sami are boring as Tag Champs
That second one was personal 😂
Expectation: Jay will betray Roman first.  Reality: Jimmy did.
W jimmy
Sheesh! Goosebump moment right there! As much as I wanted the bloodline to to crumble at WM40 for a monumental event, this’ll have to do
The best storyline in a very long time. So many different ways that played out to this conclusion
This is the best part of the ones, breaking away from the bloodline!
I knew it. He finally snapped
Roman washed out to Sea (ring side) via 2nd super kick.
3 years in the making ✅.
I wish jey should have it that 3 yrs ago
FINALLY
This definitely a WWE classic moment to treasure
Bloodline civil war at summer slam
These last 3 years have been some amazing storytelling! Roman has elevated everybody around him. There are some some great babyfaces because of his feuds. Jimmy and Jey are about to become babyfaces along with Sami and Kevin, and that's dope asf!
I loved it !! I love Roman he had to be one of favorite guys since Triple H retired but this was beautiful just the story telling bc idk about y’all but I grew up where somebody idc who it is mushing you in the face is beyond disrespect.. and it seems like Roman took his position too far and the uso tryna be family an help him lightly and made them week and I had a feeling after the first time he mushed jimmy I saw that look on his face an then the stink with the tag titles … watchin NOC tonight it was one thing to mush jimmy but then you touched his brother again ! He didn’t forget about a few years ago when it first started .. don’t forget Jimmie only joined because jey talked him into it …so to finally see jimmy snap was beautiful!! A man can only take so much as we saw with Sammy am now jimmy .. my dad always said don’t let somebody piss on you an tell you it’s raining which has been the case with the bloodline forver !! To finally see this outcome was amazing !!
It's about time
The second kick was emphatic to an ending.
And people said the Bloodline story should’ve ended at Wrestlemania…
0:56
Super kick mon part time wrestler  roman
Harshy!!what do you want to talk about??😠😠fight"(fight!! )Lesnar momentum
No Jimmy
Jey is STILL the one to dethrone Roman
Roman Reigns got what he deserves right there by Jimmy Uso he pushed his cousin too damn far and good job Jimmy for taking a stand against the bloodline. I can't wait to hear about this from Roman Reigns after Night of Champions on both Raw and Smackdown of what he just witness and what he's got to say about this.
This is kind of insane
wwe might bring me back 🫣
I think Jimmy did the right thing. After getting pushed around I would have done the same thing.
Well damm
I know this is supposed to be serious but Jey face after the second kick was hilarious
GOLDEN UP
BANGER
The kick heard around the world
0:09 Jimmy USO KICK ROMAN REIGNS'S FACE  JOEY STYLES:🤯😱😱OH MY GOD!!!!!
😮whoops that's a No No ...😢
That reaction almost blew out the ring mics like Sami's did.
Thank u and he right  for doing that
Jimmy usos  vs  Roman reigns  for the match  at summer slam or money in the bank  🦾🦾
The self destruction of Roman reigns begins
The end of The Bloodline...
I love it!!  USOs finally came to their senses🎉❤
This was so unexpected 😅 & I absolutely LOVE it!!!
Im waiting 4 this 😍
😮‍💨 SUB ZERO BRUTALITY 🔥🔥🔥 USOS 💪💪💪 NO 🧢 THE TRUE DAY ☝️s
This has always been Jey Usos story.  I still believe he will become the tribal chief.  He is showing the wisdom but he knows it is time.  When Jimmy gets hurt, he will step up.
Exactly what we've been wanting and waiting for thank you !!!!!!
Solo and jey are going to the same
Moment of 2023. no discussion😃
I always thought that jey would snap first but surprisingly it's jimmy
After seeing jimmy uso superkick roman reigns, think back what cody rhodes stated.
yo sabía que me uelia a traición
I am happy this happened 😅😅😅😅😅😅
It's been a long time coming!
WOO HOO!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉 THANK GOD FOR JIMMY USO
good usos
Finally   I screamed  from the top of my lungs when he did that   Finally finally good riddance
He should've kicked Paul Heyman face too
One of the best moments to ever happen this year
The Original Bloodline with the Usos is done ❌. To help Roman The Bloodline 2.0 should have Xyon Quinn & Tamina to make the group whole 💯💥⭐⭐⭐⭐.
Cinema.
I FELT THAT KICK!!!💯💯💥
Should’ve been jey
Me personally I think Jimmy shouldn't have done that cuz his tribal chief told him  clearly not to show at night of champions and they did so Roman has every reason to be angry. Plus alot of people hate Roman buh me? I've loved the guy since day one bruh😭😭😭Plus L Jimmy and hail your tribal chief Roman reings ☝️☝️☝️☝️
YES JIMMY!!!
I really enjoy watching..finally Roman getting a whack from there Usos..thanks Jimmy
Yes the bloodline imploded at last
Why's nobody talking about Roman's Official 1000 Day Undisputed Title Run Record ? ☝🏽
Would of been good if when Jey said "ya gotta be better then that" they both superkicked him
It was honestly kinda predictable
Jimmy Did For The Rock
As if the first kick wasn’t great the second one was too satisfying
Now that is a SAMOAN 💯💪
Yeeeeeeah!
Jimmy grew some balls
Roman Reigns tiles is coming to an end
Told ya, kevin and sami were right all along.
Roman finally got what he he deserved when he did to sami
I could watch this all day....
Jimmy Main Event Uso 🔥
I bet jimmy is going to be with Sami
I knew it. If y’all remember jimmy wasn’t down with it in the first place so this makes sense. Great job Wwe
I thought he said “you gotta do better than that” 0:35
This was 🔥 fr
That lil smirk at the end tho
Guess that was feeling Ucey😅😅
Finally!!!
I knew it  I knew it I said that the bloodline will fall 1:11
jimmy was always my favorite. roman deserved it anyway
Roman deserve that man by treating his cousins that way.
1000 Days have been officialy Reached ☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽
About damn time that one of the Usos do something about it !! As much as this whole Bloodline Story was fun , it's about time that it ends and that The Usos re-become a dominant Tag Team on their own !! :)
What a big W to end the night finally the bloodline is finally crumbling down
I knew this was coming.
Jimmy tryna get that 91 in next 2k game 😂 nah fr I thought Jey would do this
I like Roman but he deserve that 😂. Man ain’t no way you going keep treating me like a little boy.
You know it's funny no matter what the WWE does you got people say they knew that would happen.If the ring catch on fire I bet people would say that they knew that would happen.
I was shook lol
Yes Yes Yes
I genuinely threw my sofa cushions across the room 😂😂😂
And we stil with the yes movement
No need to feel bad Roman, You and Solo fought like True Warriors. We The Ones. 👆🏽👆🏽👆🏽👆🏽👆🏽
Should have continued till Roman bleed.
This is one of the best moments in WWE history. When Jimmy screams “I’m your brother” it made me think of my little brother. I would super kick the world for him.
That been brewing for yrs
Paul’s face though! 😂❤
😮😮😮I did not see that 1 coming, but the bloodline is really in trouble, but what will happen now to them?
Jimmy Uso aka HIMMY USO: “Listen to me uce I’M DOIN’ WHAT YOU SHOULD’VE DONE A LONG TIME AGO I GOT YOU (Jimmy pushes Jey out the way to superkick Roman) AAAAAHHHH AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!”
Jimmy will pay with His Life for this on Next Smackdown, just wait. The Bloodline will absolutely crush Jimmy. 👆🏽👆🏽👆🏽
I'm so happy!!! 😭 FINALLY!!
Remember Jimmy was never in the Bloodline for Roman. He was in the Bloodline for his younger brother Jey. He always looked out for Jey since day 1.
Vengeance is coming!!! Solooooooo!!!!
Roman Reigns had that coming for a very long time.  I'm glad that Jimmy Uso did that to Roman Reigns. That was awesome.
Yes this will definitely boost the ratings it's about time!
Im glad Jimmy did that
I have watched this at least 10 times plus the live show
Absolutely Perfect execution
Should've happened long time ago
Lol 😂
I think Jey is going to turn on Jimmy and stay with Roman
Everyone (and I mean, EVERYONE) thought Jey was gonna be the one to attack Roman out of frustration, but then, Jimmy came in to remind people that he still exists.
Roman Reigns welcome to tha USO PENITENTIARY!!!!!!!
I KNEW THE BLOODLINE WAS CRUMBLING 😱😱
I kept on reversing to the 2nd superkick 37 times to see how satisfying it was to see roman getting his head kicked away from the table 37 times.😂😂😂😂
I blame The Rock
Jimmy Uso kicked the SOUL out of Roman...twice. Jimmy got mad at Jey and TRIED to talk him out of this almost 3 years ago...it didn't work...UNTIL NOC.
“Ah yes. It’s all coming together now.”
Omg is this real?
jimmy did it for the rock😂😂
Good job Jimmy kick roman riengs
If Jey turns on Jimmy....I have a feeling that's where they are headed with this
Remember Hell in a Cell 2020 when Roman Reigns hurt Jey Uso
And Friday Jimmy called himself the tribal chief oooo booii this is about to get crazy
Where does Solo stand in all this tho?
I love Jimmy now
So it’s coming full circle where the whole bloodline story was about Jey defeating Roman cause Jimmy ain’t the one, Solo plays a interesting twist, but Jey been the one this was all about
Jimmy had enough of Roman pushing him in the face. When Roman saw him standing up to him, he knew he was in trouble. Jimmy isn't Jey.
For some reason, I felt the roles in the Usos were flipped......but damn,.....it finally happened.....
Finally the story isn't going in a circle.
0:17 almost a character slip by jey?
Man I can't decide what was more satisfying, Sami hitting Roman in the back with the chair or this moment.
Great match and drama in tag main event 10/10 classic,rest of ppv 7/10, well-done Seth new champion.
Upload the whole thing WWE damn
This feels so great now that Jimmy superkick Roman Reigns, and Jimmy is right he told Jey that he should of done that along time ago.
About time.
Im hard from that
I wonder if Rikishi had anything to do with this!! 😀 😀Rikishi needs to return on Smackdown next week and reveal he was behind Jimmy turning on Roman!! 😀 😀
Yooo this is beautiful I love it such a amazing story
Paul's face the whole time is cinema.
My guy jimmy uso!!!
Thank You Jimmy.❤️☝️
Jimmy uso just kicked the head off of Roman reigns😮😮😮😮😮😮
The Fall of Rome‼️
I felt relieved when he kicked him for the second time
Yesss Jimmy My Dream Came True it’s about Time
Perfect use of camera and announcing. Jimmy was perfectly hidden behind Roman so you couldn't see the kick coming. And then Michael Cole with almost nothing over the top but just OMG. Like he couldn't believe what he witnessed after the second one. Great job WWE
Every once in awhile wwe really knocks it out the park
People need to start conveying a good storyline without all using the same word.  At wrestlemania everybody said it was “electric”  Now everything is a “certified classics”  Get a thesaurus guys. However I do agree with the sentiment, it was one heck of a show.
I used to pray for times like this
This run the usos about to have about to be epic
I think jey should betray Jimmy then next ppv do jey solo Roman vs Kevin Sami Jimmy
Well done jimmy thats whats we call shedding the weakness like terry silver sheded his weakness john krees
Thank You Papa H
This is what I was picturing all this time USOs
Jimmy the Billy Goat
Im glad WWE gave Jimmy the moment, that is amazing Jimmy , he's the brother of Jey so he can't stand no more Roman bullying Jey anymore
And i thought bullet club was the only abusive of this kind of meta 😂
Bloodline stories are what keeps me drawn to WWE for the most part.
GOOSEBUMPS
I don’t quite understand the evolution of this storyline though. In the beginning it took Jey to get Jimmy on board with everything, but then it was Jimmy trying to keep Jey from unloading on Roman. So then basically out of nowhere they decided to have Jimmy as the brother that was going off the rails so to speak. Remember it wasn’t that long ago when Jey and Solo were about to kinda go at it. But Jimmy was there to help reel him in. They need to make up their minds, it’s like the freakin’ writers can’t tell the difference between them or they’re just stupid. It just doesn’t flow accurate.
What the Frick just happened😮
HELL TO THE YEAH. GO JIMMY. .
i like that  jimmy is right
Beginning of the end for THE BLOODLINE!
😮😱😶‍🌫️🤐😳🤯🫨
Yup Jimmy is dead when roman gets his hands on him
Usos!!!!!!!!!!!
well... there goes The Bloodline. 😔
Priceless !  Just priceless.
He said i gath you❤
I hope Vince McMahon is sitting down taking notes.....this...this right here is how you build up character development
Ive said it for a year Jimmy was the guy to be forced to acknowledge Roman He would be the one the end the bloodline officially
Yes
Man.. ok so Jimmy is gonna challenge for the head of the table this time around… This Storyline will go down in the HISTORY BOOKS.. But it will end With Solo becoming the head of the table!!!
This is the BEST move wwe could do rn
head of the table...😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 uhaaaaaaa much enjoy
I was disappointed about the squash match with rhea. Matches like that should not be in pay per views at all. But this more than made up for it. I loved this match.
We all saw that coming with the way Roman has been treating The Usos!! They’re falling apart
This is it folks this is it:)
Use me as a superkick button
I guess you can say that's Roman Reigns late birthday gift from Jimmy Uso 😂😂
The Bloodline is Over!!!
I actually yelled "FINALLY." THE Cracks have become a canyon.  The fall has begun. Roman's gonna at least pass Pedro's record but I give it until summerslam. When Solo turns, It's a wrap. This story has been insane and its crazy that it's finally at this point, The full decline of the bloodline.
The thumbnail looked like one of those clickbait accounts 😅
I saw this coming
Such a beautiful thing.
The Bloodline story has made EVERY PLE feel like Wrestlemania!!!
Just like Randy Orton with Cody Rhodes and Ted Dibiase
I screamed with Jimmy, damn it I wanted this outta jey but I’ll take Jimmy v Roman for the belts
I CANNOT BELEIVE IT,, OMG ,, SMASHED IT... WE KNEW USO'S PATIENCE WAS GONA RUN OUT. BUT OMG THY CUDNT HAVE DONE THIS BETTER . LOOK AT THE EMOTION ON ALL THER FACES.. WWE  JUS GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS, MY HEART RATE JUS WENT STRATOSPHERE.  THANK U , THANK.U.  TC JIMMY JUS ACKNOWLEDGED U😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
Yeah Jimmy
THe Bloodline will be no more by the time Wrestlemania comes back around, so Cody can have a legit 1v1 match for the title(s). Say what you will about Roman's reign, the storytelling for the last 2 years has been outstanding.
Jimmy: Betrays Roman Seth and Sami: first time?
Jay!!! This is what you should do long time ago!!!!  P.S. Jimmy is the least expected choice to betray Roman so good job WWE.
The storytelling my god. Jimmy screaming after was brilliant. AEW really trying to compete with this 😂
That “ I got you” was real
No lie I thought it would have been jae good job throwing me off WWE
Por fin
Every single Bloodline storyline in WWE looked as if it would lead to Jey betraying Roman, but it ended up to be the least likely Jimmy Uso.
EFFING FINALLLY.
It's about damn time they stood up
YES!!!
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Yes hit him a next one 😂😂😂  Should of happened long time
Ain't that kick in the head 🤣🤭
The first Super Kick I was like:  "You out uso"!!  Then the second Super Kick came along, I was like:  "You dead uso"!!
Booooo Jimmy
FINALLY.
That was awesome I bet the crowd went nuts that was a treat that’s a rare moment there
Jimmy decided he's had enough of Roman's BS
To be honest I didn’t not see that coming 😐😐 now there’s one question who will jey uso choose between jimmy uso or the tribal chief roman reigns?🤔
This is fire 🔥
This makes the years of Smackdown being "The Bloodline Show" all worth it. That first superkick was self defense, the second was a personal choice 😂😂
This storyline deserves a Emmy. The bloodline and everyone that was involved including Sami Zayn and Paul Heyman
it makes sense for jimmy to snap first. he was rebellious towards roman at first. only reason he put up with him was because jey
Imagine what Jim Ross has to say when he's in commentary
Tnks jimmy ❤❤❤❤
Esto es cine ❤
Jimmy you really showed what Sami said all along Roman is doesn't care about you guys  Thank God Roman is done the end is coming very quickly 😅
anybody getting the Debut Version of the Usos vibes but as Heels now
About damn time!
That was awesome 😂
The WHOLE BLOODLINE deserves EMMYS
YES THANK YOU JIMMY
Iam sorry but I like Roman. But he deserves that.  Cause he was getting on my nerves.
Yes but haven’t when seen this story already??? I mean didn’t Roman beat both twins just to become tribal Chief in the 1st place . Yes the story is a remix to it but it’s still the same story . I didn’t see anything different except championship. But some how is still Great to watch. Great job with the writing
Glad this happened Jimmy was the original roman victim in the story ❤
👌👌Es cine hdspm 🚬
If you don’t understand the definition of situational irony, watch this story line from start to finish, we all thought that jey would be the one, but it was Jimmy who as roman says “pull the trigger” 💯
Now this is going to become viral. 😂
This storyline needs to culminate with Jey winning the Rumble
Was really hesitant in believing that Jimmy would turn on Roman and at the back of my mind had always thought that Jimmy was just playing along to make Sami believe that their are "cracks" on the bloodline but daaaaammmnnn, this is another icing on cake with this whole storyline, this whol Bloodline faction and storyline are really doing wonders for guys like Sami Zayn, Kevin Owens and now Jimmy and possibly Jey too 👏👏👏👏
Finally!!!
Everyone in the bloodline is going to go on a power trip because they want to be Tribal chief. Might just be a bloodline fatal 4 way for the titles….
Finally Jimmy Snapped 😂
I knew that when it happened, it would have been because one was defending the other. I'm so proud.
If you look closely you can see this isn’t real but in fact just poor acting
this segment was 4 years in the making. and it was executed perfectly
Ahahaha couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy!
😯 what...?
Those not invested in this storyline are the same morons who believed Liv Morgan was going to be a main eventer last year, and who think trash Cody is a legit main eventer. This storyline is the ONLY reason to tune into WWE. Cody is either well on his way to being a mid-carder or being handed the title, but not earning it. This lame no quit Cody angle has become a joke
I thought Jey Going To Super Kick Roman but in stead we see jimmy super kick Roman 😂😂 I am ready for this coming Friday
They did it at a Saudi show 😐 they could care less
This will be the most viewed video of NOC 2023😂🎉
Triple H - Thank you!
I got you! Aaargh! We takin it back to Roman vs. Jay I Quit Match. Only reason he quit was to save Jimmy.
시원하다^^
Jimmy was over Roman’s bs
No, I would like to see the Usos join impact wrestling to me. I think they will work better over there thumbs up.
Jimmy what are you doing!?!?
You go Jimmy . you did to Roman     what jey should have done a few years ago.roman did respect you or Jey Roman is a user and taker
This is amazing
DAY ONE ISH 🔥☝🏽 never forgetting this moment. Hell of a ride for the Bloodline but this whole storyline has been golden since the pandemic era. Can’t wait to see what happens next !
Those screams of frustration and release after the second kick is everyones feeling. LFG
Jimmy was looking for the right time to do this and the right time is here when RR was harassing and humilating  Jay,  emediatly  jimmy reacted because he is  tired of RR and for a minute I thought Jay was ganna end up doing this but jimmy did it ...Thank you Jay I got you bro and jimmy kicked RR again..the best story line of all time and I'm 41Years 0ld , i stoped watching wwe when Eddie guerrero passed away so this story line brought me back..i love it. ...
@whatculture Golden up please
This is why we love wrestling. Storytelling at it's finest.
I think Roman dies for a second.!
Greatness
Shoulda been Solo. But this works too.
I literally cried when he super kick Roman Reigns
Aye usos fight each other sometimes. That's family. It's gonna be alright 🩸☝🏽
You got to do better than that
Wow!!!!!!
Roman... You knew this day would come... The sheer delight from that superkick is beyond words! Brilliant storytelling. Jimmy is the Tribal Chief, Jimmy is the Bloodline! Well, you know Cody said it best.... A Roman with no Reigns, A Chief without a Tribe... Oh, things are getting warmed up!
An amazing story that went on for such a long time. Congrats to the writers of this one. Incredible face turn for Jimmy USO. The 2kicks to Roman topped it all so Smackdown should be interesting on Friday
Poor Roman 😔 Always getting betrayed
NOOOOOOOOO
I did it for the Rock! Rikishi
Anyone else notice Roman fell down the same way when Sami hit him with the chair at Royal Rumble?
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
I like how Jey is still conflicted and he was still trying to see if Roman was ok after the first super kick. On another side note the USO's do not even look like twins anymore. Remember when Jey said people would say, "which one are you?" This Bloodline storytelling and character development has gave each USO a new identity and presence. Just tiny things I noticed after Jimmy super kick The Tribal Chief into oblivion 😂!!!
Finally this happened
And here we thought Jey was the only one who could shine in this storyline. Jimmy is showing his brother how it’s done now! EPIC!!
i called this months ago when Jey was still iffy of Sami...Jimmy needs his own thing, he's overshadowed by Roman/Solo/Jey and has never had a spotlight and i think he's got the chops to take on Roman for the title
Like I Said Months ago, It just a Matter of Time before The Usos Betray "The Tribal Chief" Roman Reigns... Jimmy Uso started the Ball Rollin', Especially after the Way Jey Uso was getting Shoved and Slapped around, Jimmy Uso says, "Enough is Enough...
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jey can't defeat Reigns multiple times last time for the Universal title, maybe it's time for Jimmy.
Solo will dethrone Roman and take the seat as the head of the table. Hes been strong in everything he does and will be more ruthless than roman ever was
Jey can't defeat Reigns multiple times last time for the Universal title, maybe it's time for Jimmy.
We had main event Jey, now we got main event Jimmy. I’m here for it
Oh Hell Yes I'm so happy to see of Osos stand up to their so called chef😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
it’s crazy because we all thought it would be jey who would do it first
Just waiting for Jey to snap next 💯💯
IM SO HAPPY HE TURNED ON HIM
Am l the only one who thinks this is the best storytelling of the modern era
This is full circle moment jimmy saving jey from the abuse once again with a huge difference of outcomes… can’t wait for money in the bank and summerslam…
0:07 0:09 0:52
That scream from Jimmy after the second kick felt emotional frfr
Crowd chanting 1 more time makes this soo good
This won't be good for Jimmy, because you see that he's Just taking his brother down with the Ship, because Jey knows what's gonna happen to him if he's close to Roman, he was Trying to control the Situation with Roman, but by that moment Jimmy superkicked Roman, and Jey was Trying to redeem himself, Trying if Roman is alright, but Jimmy Just didn't want to hear him out, but All that I can tell is that Jimmy Will crash the celebration of Roman at Smackdown, and Jey Will try to stop him, Mark my words, this A good time to be a WWE fan, can't wait to see Smackdown this Coming Friday.
SHEESH!
When he kicked his face i was shouting across my living room
The New Head
❤❤❤❤❤❤
3 Years in the making
When did it switch from jey to jimmy being the one annoyed with Roman?
Let's gooooo
0:09 0:52
Finally the chain broke and the armour was penatrated
I screamed so loud Jimmy did it!!
Love the bloodline and it sucks its coming to an end, but it should've been Jey. Jey should've hit the superkick on Roman and then an emotional Jimmy followed with a superkick to Roman. I mean the whole build up between Jey and Roman for it to go down like this...
WWE the usos FACE!!!!! roman reigns HEEL
Feel bad watching this
And now the story line gets bad. Why can’t we simply have the bloodline again a new crew around Sami the clown?
Y do I feel accomplished after watching this
Jimmy's face turn.  That's what Roman gets for punking him and his brother
I THOUGHT SOKO SOMEHOW TURN ON ROMAN &ROMAN BECOME A GOOD GUY AGAIN&THEN LEAVEWWE.
Gay and fake
worst storyline ever. I hope all three of them get fired soon
Yeeessssss I know that felt soooooo Good 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
0:09 YES YES YES Kick his head off Jimmy
Finally I've Waited For This ❤❤❤🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥Jimmy Thank You
I love Roman he's My favorite wrestler but When you push a person to far this is what is gonna happen it's the beginning of end now
This is hard to watch
About time. Reigns is a little bitcj.
YEESSSSSS FINALLY
Jey been going through all sorts of emotions these past months
Jimmy: I'm doing what you should have done a long time ago, I got you
I can't believe what I just witnessed,  but then again it was bound to happen
Life is hard for Jey Uso
I feel bad for Jey it’s like deja vu to him with Sami and now Jimmy
Jeddah were chanting one more time,one more time 😅
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES Jimmy 😂😂😂😂😂
Seems like they wanna pull the plug on Roman’s reign (pun intended) promptly upon reaching 1000 days.
Sami said the truth
Lmfaooo why this got me hype af
Another Twist to this great STORYLINE, a real SEASON FILM😃
FINALLY
Finally !!!!
Cody was right when he said the Usos would betray him
Even before the bloodline Jimmy did not like what was going on,  on the other hand, Jey had so much dog in him he was willing to die before he gave up to roman,  Jimmy saw that and came to save Jey,  but during all that time to now, Roman started putting his hands on Jimmy,  Jimmy ain't like that,  this was building up for a long time, cause last time Jey had to step in on Jimmy rushing roman.   Did you hear Jimmy SCREAM in pent up frustration after?
When he said "I got you" I about died 😂😂
Just sucks that wwe is planning to keep the belts on Reigns going into 2024 smh
If you keep poking at a bear, the bear will bite you
Got tired of being a puppet
Rakishi probably happy and sad all at once
Jey's reaction cracked me up!!!!
Tremendous storytelling, if you didn’t grow up fighting your family member and your brother had your back from your other cousin etc very relatable that’s what make this storyline so beautiful man good job by all parties involved. family fights happens it was a time I was arguing with my older cuzzo and my big brother jumped in for me just like that.
Prayers for you guys prayers for you guys the head of the table and the bloodline you can get through this with Jesus help family always sticks together
Roman needs to thank Triple H (and whoever else helped create this storyline) The USO's and Sami Zayn. The character change for Roman was the best thing to happen to his career (outside of the shield) him going heel worked PERFECTLY for him. The bloodline storyline was great and The USO's don't get enough credit. They are the reason the bloodline is as affective as it's been, without them there is no bloodline ahaha. BUT give Sami Zayn his flowers, the bloodline storyline was starting to get downhill a little until Sami was added to the storyline. Don't forget, what we're seeing right now with Jimmy/The USO's, and the bloodline is a direct result of what Sami put into motion.
He got acknowledged 😂😂😂😂
Its best for the bloodline that the usos go on their own
The best moment of the entire night and LONG overdue 🎉
Well Roman did tell Jimmy to do something. Well…. Jimmy did!
Esta parte de mi vida está pequeña parte se llama felicidad 😂 por fin coñazo ya era hora estamos harto de lo mismo 😂😂 pero que felicidad tengo Diooooos mío 😂
Long Overdue 🥊🔥🥊🔥
Who else had to play this numerous times over
😮
We knew it was going to happen just didn't know when
I watched this video over a 100x  today 😂
I guess we'll be seeing Jimmy Uso vs. Roman Reigns for WWE title at Money in the Bank, Jey Uso got his title shots a few years ago.
About damn time 😂😂😂
Cool
Bloodline no more and Reigns no longer the champ
YES
Talking about a jaw dropping REACTION! Jimmy did that to Roman! Lest to say that the Bloodline is on MAJOR LIFE SUPPORT!
Mano eu fiquei com a mesma reação do jey
Mano eu fiquei com a mesma reação do jey
The way Roman took that 2nd Superkick was 😘
I love this I love jimmy energy I thought it was gonna be jay but hey I’m all for it
Great story!! But it’s over
He took his head off
Step for history this fight 😂❤❤
Yes thank you God yes
I said it to myself... uso's would "try" to help but hit roman then Solo.  Called the story b4 it happened.  Great story tho, loving it.
Yeaaaaaaa😊
😢😢😢😢😢💔💔💔💔🥵🥵🥵🥵💔💔🖕🏾🖕🏾
“I’M DOING WHAT YOU SHOULD’VE DONE A LONG TIME AGO!!!!!” 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lmao and believe the fact that lots of IWC fans moped after Roman retaining at WM saying it was boring.. this is boring to you? That just made this so much better.
That was a crazy build up because I know a lot of us thought it would be Jey to strike first
Jimmy Uso did what he had to do, he's done being pushed around
Finally we all knew it was coming
About time believe in that
The gutteral scream Jimmy did after the second kick, you know that's been building and weighing. Cinema, NGL.
ONE MORE TIME  ONE MORE TIME  LOVE IT
Wow this is real,well done Jimmy 👍 finally Jey always put up with Roman fot Jimmy Now Jimmy ended it...
Finally
0:09 The perfect call
Ist kick Whoooooooa. 2nd kick AYYYYYYYY
Just awesome the whole match I was waiting for this to happen
The consequences are coming soon
Michael Cole: “Ooohh my god” 😂😂😂
😳😳
Friday night is going to be lit
About time someone put Roman lame in his place!
The super kick heard around the world!
SIUUUUUUU
That was So Cool the way Jimmy kicked that bully Roman Reigns
Yes!!! Jimmy did it!!
Bumba claat lol
That was awesome and long time coming
Jey’s just upset that Jimmy beat him to it
The primal scream after the second kick, like he had been holding that in this whole time, was a magnificent touch
Looks like WWE is going to push Jimmy Uso as the one to dethrone Roman
Yeaaaaaaaaa Jimmy!!!!!
This was better than Rollins betraying the shield 😂 facts!
Bloodline  explosion 😢
What a great ppv, definitely didn't expect Brock to win and we got a new woman's WWE champion, and a face turn from the Usos
This story just keeps getting better bravo wwe
😱😱😱😱😱😱
he superkicked him twice did you not see???
Who knew this was coming?
Roman is a modern Triple H b**** 😂
🔥
And people were saying it was stale
I'm still rocking with the bloodline till its completely gone like jimmy I get yall have issues but really two wrongs don't make a rite, and jey face told it all, I just wonder what solo thinks of all this
I knew it it'd gonna be this feeling
I yelled in excitment fir my son who was downstairs and scared my kittle grandkids in the process. They all think im crazy now 😂! I was so glad to see Jimmy stand up!  That line...  "I'm doing what you should have done a long time ago..."
MAD TING
ahí se ponen más brutal la pelea
But WTF ?
I so needed to see that
To anyone saying they're tired of the bloodline, or it's gone on too long, just remember they've been the BEST thing going for the last few years. This is easily one of the best stories WWE has ever told.
🤦🏾‍♂️joe going to hurt them boyz
Omg so glad he did tht 😊
Hell yea!!!!
that second superkick of jimmy gave me goosebumps
Yesssss!!!
This was wack asf 😒😒
Legit. With timing, length, and impact….this may well be the best storyline since Austin/McMahon.
Al fin!!!!!
Yesssssssssss
Oh man...setting up a triple threat match now.  Roman vs the Usos.  And then each of the Usos will pin Roman at the same time, split the belts.
Both usos are so talented and would be great solo competitors
Yes,yes,yes
And it all comes crumbling down. All that's left is to Sink the Island like it was Atlantis and Take The Rest of the Chief's Gold.
Wwe is on absolute fire w this storyline man omfg🔥🔥🔥
The journey begins 🔥
I’m pretty certain everyone saw this coming. Already knew the usos would interfere tonight. Wasn’t expecting it to be this good though
I GOT YOU 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
😮
ACKNOWLEDGE THE USOS ❤️
Well Done 👍 Jimmy USO
0:09 OH MY GOD🤯 I WAS RIGHT THE WHOLE TIME!
Remember…Jimmy never wanted to be in the Bloodline in the first place. He was trying to free Jey from Roman’s control.
YES！YES！YES！
finally the uso are free
Now ain't that a (0:09, 0:53) {double} kick in the head.
The Bloodline if officially Over😢 it’s been a good ride Fellas. but man Was Jimmy’s super kick so satisfying lol
Wtf when was this!?
A man can only take so much abuse before they snap. I honestly don't blame Jimmy for doing this I would have done the same thing too. Congrats to Jimmy uso for having the guts to do what needed to be done. Roman deserve this kick from Jimmy uso.
YESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!! THANK YOU JIMMY MY BOY!!!!!!!!!!🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾
I love Jimmy.
I’m glad Jimmy did this! He deserves better
I can't remember the last time I watched a WWE Pay per View. I had a great time watching it with my buddy (his idea). I felt so good when Jimmy super kicked Roman.
Roman deserved every bit of that.
I still say it's Solo Sikoa that's gonna end Roman's reign (😁) Come the title match with Cody, they'll come to a stalemate, Reigns will be expecting solo to Samoan spike Cody but solo will switch & hit Roman with the spike leaving it open for Cody to hit the crossroads & become the new champion.
Finally
I was saying man this Bloodline storyline is getting old they have to do something big soon and to their credit they did. Can't wait to see what happens next honestly
About damn time
This was the only good thing about this ppv. It should have been free.
That I got you....mannnnnnnnnn🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
HOLY 💩  Guess Jimmy Uso TRULY is Nobody's B!TCH man The Implosion of  The Bloodline ☝🏿🩸 is going to be generational Y'all
Yes! it needed to happen
Time to take Roman ro the Uso penitentiary
yh no he dead
the bloodline story from the start has had me hooked and it keeps getting better with the betrayals. Still waiting for the moment when Reigns loses the titles
I bet this video will reach one million viewers or more!
the way i screamed YES at the top of my lungs when this happened
NANi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jimmy USO being Dominik Mysterio LAKAS TAMA JIMMY 🔥
Usos : the HEART of the table.
I gotta say this was well written, just needed to have the right chosen time for this to blow up
It's always a pleasure when they use Roman as a punching bag.
Now that was awesome
Shield better reunite, would be the best moment in WWE history
Jey laughed at jimmy face before...he said what are you doing
That had to feel good...but when it's Jay's turn??? U just watch...
That scream was primal!!
Jimmmmmyyyy yeah my boy
If wrestlers were ever going to get Oscars everyone involved in The Bloodline should get one, The USOs and Roman are legitimately amazing actors.
Jey will heel turn on Jimmy 😢
Thank you Jimmy ! That's all I wanna say.
חרא על רומן ריינס
The best
was not expecting JIMMY to do this i thought it was going to be jey
This is the best storyline of all time 🔥
Cinema
Cody Rhodes beat him for two titles
OH HELL YEAH! It's finally about time that the one-half of the Uso's finally step up and take down Roman. Let's not forget during the 2020 pandemic episode where Jey tapped out from his cousin Roman and said "I quit" before Jey's twin came to his rescue.
there is a saying every man has their breaking point well what jimmy just did not once but twice is a perfect example
“I’m doing what you should have done a long time ago", cold.
There's only so much one person could take before they eventually snap.
Yes yes finally this is what I’ve been waiting for. Finally the bully gets put in his place
So Monday it's back to normal
Yesss yessir this is so fun to watch
Jimmy delivered the final blow.
The most satisfying Superkick I’ve ever seen. Ive replayed it over a dozen times now.  Well done 🔥 Excellent storytelling.
....Boodline best storyline in wrestling in last 25 years
We have waited forever people finally we have it
Thanks Jimmy, he deserved it.
Honestly? I didn't feel anything at this moment. Maybe others did and more power to them. But it should've been Jay who did this and it should've happened at Wrestlemania. They butchered this entire story just to give Roman an arbitrary 1000 day long reign
Honestly what an ending!! Loved it, what a 2nd super kick to Roman that was!! 💪
Total foolishness how can you betry you cousin
I had an orgasm after that kick, and another after that low kick 😂
I’m really loving the in ring storytelling whenever Sami, KO, Jimmy, Jey, and Roman 🔥🔥🔥 it adds so much more to the matches for me ❤
Two superkicks👏👏👏bravo Jimmy
Roman reigns had it coming
“I’m gonna do what you should’ve done a long time ago!”   *kicks Roman to the next week*   My god what a moment!!!
Family falling apart! Love the storyline the writers did.
Never liked the usos super kick. Doesn’t quite have that Samoan style like rikishi or umagas had
YES! YES! YES! YES! I'm so excited 😂 congratulations Jimmy Uso for being the tribal chief.
Theres always a plan B
Nice bro!
Tonight wasn’t cinema, folks…this is professional wrestling at its absolute best.
The volcano had erupted and his name is Jimmy uso
Imagine if Paul turns face. Lol
I don't get excited much for Wwe programming these days but this....  This is where it's at. Between last night on Smackdown and right now the stuff with the Usos and Roman is what's happening.
Jimmy hasn’t forgot what he did to him 3 yrs ago
are we final getting a jimmy vs jey match???👀
Now we taiking …now that’s wrestling
I've been waiting years for this ngl
My jaw dropped. 😮😮😮
The usos thus far have the best acting when it comes to this storyline the emotions they put in just proves how great they are
yes yes yes yes yes
CM Punk owns the Bucks!!
This should had happen in Summer Slam
NOOOO!!!! THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!!! THIS IS NOT GOOD!!!
Legend has it Paul Heyman is still standing there stunned
Words can't describe the smile I have on my face because of this!!!
Finally!  Something to shack up the WWE Universe!!!
A very long time coming, must have been damn hard for jimmy to do this but in the words of Michael Cole, "They may have lost, but that had to feel good" And I quote Kevin Owens "Roman!! You Know it's over don't you." And that phrase couldn't have described the look of loneliness on Romans face any better.
And some fans wants us to miss out on this classic because of Cody   What a storyline so far
JIMMY USO IS HIM  Start calling him HIMMY USO
DAMNNNNNNNNNNNNN🫢
Predictable
This going to lead to Roman and Solo vs the usos
New respect for jimmy
I thought they’d wait to summerslam or survivor series.
Finally
I never thought I see the day the bloodline broke up
The whole Bloodline storyline has been a rollercoaster. Loved all the twist and turns!!!
I think we have an idea who can dethrone Roman.
Four words. Hell. In. A. Cell.
finally
Sami and KO finally got to Jimmy head and Jimmy knew it was time. The moment that Jimmy threw in the towel to save his brother to this. Jimmy finally snapped. Now I can't wait until Jey does too when we see a beat down on Jimmy by Roman. Again...this Bloodline story has been amazing since 2020.
this is cinema worthy.
Welcome to the Uso Penitentiary Big Dawg 😂
How are the elders going to take this attack on roman?
The fall of the bloodline is coming
I knew it!!!!!!!!!!!!
It’s about time
The crowd reacted like when Tyson fury knocked out Wilder
😊agalera vai a loucura kkkkkkkk
Jimmy USO did to Roman Reigns what all of us wanted to see happen a long time ago. Roman Reigns put in his place. So damn satisfying! The Tribal Clown is not invincible. 😁😁😁
The Bloodline is finally over.
Yea … I thought Cody would win the belt at wrestlemania but Summerslam looking more likely
Finally the moment we all have been waiting for the bloodline turned on Romain
"ROMAN SUCKS"
The Bloodline is done.
I don’t want the uso to be cool with Sami and ko after this that would be one mistake considering Sami still betrayed their trust
I was yelling loud asf when he did that before he hit him with the second one I was yelling hit him again !!!!!! Lmao
The Bloodline is over.
welp they ruined a great thing but roman vs jimmy gonna be fye
Crazy how jey fueded with reigns jimmy came vack now its jimmy turn  Bloodline coming to and end
Roman Reigns is going to be so mad and also hurt this Friday on Smackdown.
Its about damn time
damn jimmy , i can feel he was so satisfied!!
LOVED seeing that!! 😆 Roman had that one coming for a LONG time! 😊   Oh, and **SPOILER** alert….      Congrats to ASUKA & SETH “FREAKIN” ROLLINS on their respective title wins!!! 🤩🥳👏
When WWE decides to bring back the attitude era iconic drama. I love it 🔥🔥🔥
I’m glad they went their own ways too bc Roman thinks he own Shii
Jimmy finally had enough and broke. Now for the brothers to move on to bigger and better opportunities, and Roman to take the vacation he has been wanting to take.
Best moment of the whole ppv
Did they win the belts
The Usos is gonna get lots of love again
Thank u papa h great storytelling
Jimmy and Jey should got there rematch at night of champions to face tag team champions Roman and his tag team partner shouldn't haven't get a match for the tag team championship's someone needs to take Roman both championships need a new champion
This shocked me more than when Sami hit roman with the chair
Aint gon Lie When Jey Said “Gotta do better than that I thought they was gon do a double kick to him🤣🤣
The Pop would’ve been a lot louder if it was in Puerto Rico 🇵🇷
Yes...! Finally, The Bloodline will no longer be together...😂😂😂 You got served, Roman Reigns... This is your ego & your ego will over... Game Over...🤣🤣🤣 I was loved Roman, but now ... I don't know how to say... Bull🤬
Thank god I’m tired of hearing that cheating part timer saying acknowledge me BS
He should have been did that.
This feud is going somewhere they better not mess this up 😂
I love it!!!!
jimmy laid the smackdown on roman. usos the reason why the tribal chief kept those tittles.
Good job Jimmy
This intensity of that scream from Jimmy! Long time coming!!! 😱
Bloodline civil war arc begins.
Jimmy's guttural scream after he super kicks Roman for the 2nd time was the cherry on top. Years of pent up emotion of having to put up with Roman's gaslighting and abuse, all coming out in that scream.
Jimmy's truly "nobody's B*tch"
🤯
Jimmy finally in the same level as Jey if not further.
And then the world got shocked!!
Well,well,well soon Roman will lose his belts
Well f**king done Jimmy
It’s about damn time Roman realizes jimmy has had enough
give him a singles title
Jimmy putting himself in the same level as Jey performances with this.
Guys I like what happened to the head of the table ,jimmy finally shows up to prove Roman as nothing
Bro the crowd pop sounded identical to Sami’s chair shot (love how they popped again after the second)
Jimmy should have taken out Heyman too.
Take that! 😂😂
MAIN EVENT JEY USO
That was so satisfying to watch.
It's happening
In all this I love Jey trying to protect his brother. He knows first hand what Romans anger and wrath can be like.
Yesssssss💯💯💯💯
This is getting better and better!! As the words of hhh… “The story continues “…
nice kick oso they deserve it
Thats some GOOD storytelling
Finally!
I heard Jey say “you gotta do better” and I thought he was about to out do Jimmy 😂
I knew things would transpire this way.  Predicted that The Usos would interject  themselves into the Tag-Team match but mess things up.  Enraging Roman to where he subjects both of them to "Tribal Chief" punishment and causing all that pent up frustration to boil over where Jimmy retaliates after years of mistreatment and humiliation.  What a moment, well executed.
USOs started romans run. Maybe the usos will end Romans run🤷🏻‍♂️
YESSSSSS Its about Time🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
See the look on hawgjaw lmao
As Sami Zayn once said in his best promo: „ROMAN, YOU ARE GOING DOWN!“
What a moment!!!
I guess Roman found out he's not the only Samoan with a temper.
0:09, 0:52
This was the most incredible thing I have watched. Roman got exactly what he deserved. I hope Jimmy and Roman have a match for the title belts and Jimmy defeats Roman.
That "I gotchu" was deeper than the audience think. Jimmy letting his brother kno this time around he got his back 💯 loving this
Lets go!!!
The blodnine 👋 maybe  sumerslam or money in the bank  the usos vs Roman Reings and Solo Sikoa
Lame
Jimmy Uce I acknowledge you
God damm it F jimmy!
I'm... I'm not sure how to feel about this... I was thinking Jey would be the one pulling that trigger.
for some the end made me so happy
It’s happeninggg!!!
I love them both, but this is why Jimmy is my favorite.
The way Jimmy Uso goes crazy and screams after superkicking Roman Reigns was absolutely an insane moment of 2023.
😅I can't wait to see the moment when roman will finally kick both jimmy and jey out of the bloodline for sticking their noses where they didn't belong and costing him and solo the victory
This is definitely going to make history
The superkick heard around the world. This storyline is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.
So jey didn’t give a dam what the tribal chief say and jimmy becomes the Tribal chief
All I gotta say is, this is one hell of a story told by all these men involved and I love it!
Why jimmy uso and key uso
Roman's selling is top tier ☝️
Thank god this horrible story line can finally end. They had to make an entirely new belt because they have a garbage part timer champion holding both for no reason.
Could she see your cheeks baby
Woo Roman saw stars lol
First Sami zayn, now Jimmy Uso stabbed roman...... yessssssss ‼️NO MORE BLOODLINE, thank goodness....
I was shocked at this and said it's about damn time
“Im doing what you should have done a long time ago!!” - Jimmy to Jey
Roman really deserve that💀  No seriously like he really did              Like no joke    ….
Well Jimmy has FINALLY got to his breaking point I said that Jimmy is not gonna let Roman Reigns get all tha Spotlight
Jimmy is going for the belt, but I see the "Rock" being being part of this too.
When the usos debuted they were generic as hell. Years later is crazy how they became one the greatest tag team.
In the words of the THE ROCK Finalllyyyyyyyyytyy
Disgusting 🤢 I blame that scumbag Sami Zayn tearing apart a beautiful family 👪
I ACKNOWLEDGE JIMMY USO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That's some good fake fighting
I love this video so much, I ran it back several times already😁😁😁😁😁😁. The way jimmy screamed at the end, I felt that
Yessssssss
It’s about dang time
I knew it was Jimmy who was gonna snap.  Good stuff.
I'm indifferent to this until Roman loses those titles.
Yes!!!
Why would you split the bloodline 🙄 y’all dumb
aew can only ever fantasize about telling storylines this brilliant.
NOW THATS WAS UCEY!!!
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
WWE should keep backstabbing Roman until they can run a "Top Ten Roman Betrayals" list.
YES! YES! YES!
Whoever wrote this bloodline story needs to be inducted into the wwe hall of fame when this story is finished it just keeps getting better and better…I’m so happy to be a wrestling fan this made my weekend even more epic thankyou wwe
Can’t wait till Jim review this
I was speechless when Jimmy did that to Roman
FINALLY GIVING HIM A TASTE OF HIS OWN MEDICINE
Rome has fallen.
BROOOO I LOVVEE THIS SOOO MUCHHH.PEOPLE THINK REIGNS IS FULL OF HIMSELF BUT NAHHH..HE JUST BEING THE TRIBAL CHIEF AND THIS ALL JUST FAMILY AFFAIRS...I LOVE HOW LOYAL JEY IS TO THE TRIBALL CHIEF...THEY FAMILY MUST STAY TRUE
"I Got you!" than hits Roman with a superkick, love it
When I saw this I was screaming a lot because I knew Jimmy is a smart person to pull the trigger and I felt his pain after that scream for 2 years
It finally happened
Wait What? WAIT what? WAIT WHAT? wtf...I always thought Jey is the bad guy of The Usos...But Jimmy? Hell yeah....someone must had the balls to break roman's slavery.... now i cant wait for the next Raw episode 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.
When Jimmy saw Jey getting push around that was it, he was done with the tribal chief.
The most compelling story ever told, we all thought it would be Jey but it was Jimmy who turned.
🙂😀😁good roman deserves that he's nothing without them the real tribal chief is the rock
Jimmy: (To Jey) I'M DOING WHAT YOU SHOULDA DONE A LONG TIME AGO!!!!!   This was definitely a long time coming 💯
I love it man .
You want to know why this is so fire cause Jimmy turning on Roman is motivated by the disrespect he sees Roman give his twin brother. A lot of the choices that we see The Usos make throughout this storyline as individuals seem to be motivated by protecting each other... we finally see a moment where Jimmy had enough and snapped and it's only fitting that he tells Jey "i gotchu" right before doing so... what's even deeper is the fact that them Samoan boys really created a storyline to put each member of their family over in an unselfish way... throughout their entire run we all seen the spotlight shift from member to member as well as those who they feud with. What we are seeing now is Jimmy's time and we're here for it.
Hahahhaa aids or what
“The revolution will be televised”
The new Tribal Chief ☝🏽
It’s the I Got You! For me 🥹
I SHOULDN'T HAVE OPENED YOUTUBE BUT THIS IS SIIIIIIIICK‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Jimmy is tired and now he wants that smoke❤❤❤
Consider that Jey was forced to join the Bloodline because Roman couldn't beat him in an I Quit match so he attacked Jimmy instead and forced Jey to quit to save him. Then consider that Jimmy was forced the join the Bloodline due to Roman's manipulation about Jey, when Jimmy initially wanted to fight Roman from the get go.  So Jimmy turning first makes a ton of sense.  Roman used him twice to get to Jey and he'd had enough of watching his brother be used.
Let's not act surprised by this....
Literal goosebumps watching this unfold
MAIN EVENT JIMMY USOOOOO!!!!!! But now what is gonna happen with Jey and Solo?
Shades of Hell in a Cell 2020.
Uh oh.
I just realized that Roman should never be in a team again because all of his break ups of teams ends with betrayal
Eso selo buco mi jefe rival aserto ke el lo preciona
First jimmy, second jey, third solo. Fourth Paul heyman is going to show his true colors and leave Roman after he loses the wwe and universal titles at mania.
Smackdowns finna be a great episode
i was happy about Roman ate jimmy ‘s super kick but twice that i want see this make Roman stay shut the fk up i don’t knowledge you roman! you are soon lost your stupid title after 1,000 reign title! i’m want that Usos leave roman’s side and Solo too!
I told my girlfriend that I it’s going to happen
To be honest this gimmick kinda play out for too long and overrated.  Man I hope they bring back the old usos back to life. Bloodline is just boring.
Jimmy let’s go!!! I bet people remember jimmy now
HIMMY USO!!!
Jimmy kicked Roman this might mean that Roman could lose his titles very soon
This payoff alone makes wrestlemania worth it?
Thank goodness!
All that anger built inside of him
usos vs roman/solo MONEY IN THE BANK ?
Burn down the tribal chief
i know im doing some insane fantasy booking but imagine if wwe make a deal with new japan to get the Guerrillas of Destiny to come in as the usos replacement in the bloodline :P
Jimmy didnt forget that roman use him to make Jey say I quit. Well done Jimmy
Yessss
Finally!
Jimmy is literally his brother’s keeper ❤️‍🔥
Solo were you at?
Heyman is surprised? You know, if he were such a wise man, why didn't he counsel Roman to stop pushing the Usos away? He's just as much at fault as Roman. Hell Roman's whole reign exists because of them. To take a page from his book, didn't he inform Reigns that it would be better having them inside the castle pissin out, rather than outside pissin in? Without a tribe, what is he the chief of? Nothing.
Did Jimmy Uso betrayed Roman Reings?!
Best part of the night
OMG
A lot of people been asking and now they have received what they been hoping for a long time
That is the end of the bloodline dose this means the usos will join back with Sami zayn
Jimmy should rename his superkick "the chef's kiss."
Rewind it, I swear it gets better and better every time
The new tribal chief rises
Reigns remains The Tribal Chief but he's no more an Uce!
I really thought Jey was gonna
Without Jimmy, Jey & Solo always interfering in Roman's title matches he would've lost a long time ago.  I hope Jimmy brings that up on Raw or Smackdown
Roman son hunos animales
It’s about BLOODY TIME ROMEN RAINS GOT HIS BELL RUNG AND TWICE TO BOOT BY HIS OWN FAMILY ?. You can only push someone to a POINT BEFORE THEY PUSH BACK ! AND JIMMY USO IS GOING OUT ON A HIGH ?.
Jimmy❤
I literally jumped from my chair and flipped myself all over my bedroom after watching this😱 i knew something was going to happen to the bloodline at night of champions
Hopefully the Roman Reign of Terror ends soon after this.
Knew this was gonna happen he had it coming good on u Jimmy now this is what i’m talkin bout 🔥🔥
my god how i loved this
I freaking love roman but i love usos so much too so he deserved that and I’m not mad🤷‍♀️💜
It started when choked jimmy 2 yrs ago and it dhould end with jimmy.. Remember Jey surrendered to Roman tonsave Jimmy. It makes perfect sense.
I have been waiting for ever for this
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😮😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Hahahahaha Hahahahaha Hahahahaha 😂😂😂😂😊
It’s just like what Sami Zayn did Roman reigns at the Royal rumble and ima glad jimmy kick Roman in the face now it can just be the day one
I can't for smackdown it's going to be wild
I don't really know what to think about this match, after all it's just scripted but it could bring many emotions.. I really like Roman Reigns for his history, agility and his character and i'm sorry for him even though he was the villain all the time.
Roman reigns drive jimmy crazy to the point where he get tired like real talk
That's why he is the tribal chief
0:07 ¡ get out of my ring !
The "I got you" from Jimmy holds so much burden. That superkick was the ultimate relief.
Great long term storytelling
FINALLY!!!!!!!
When this happened, my adrenaline surged, and it was like God finally answered one of my prayers!!!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! The Bloodline is finally breaking up and Roman finally gets what he deserves.
I personally it's a bit too early for Usos to betray Roman. Play it out till Summerslam. Build on the tension and have Paul Heyman raise the tension further
As a brother, that "I gotch-U" just hits differently
2 things because WWE is so predicable...Jimmy will really leave or its a twist and he's staying.
FINALLY FINALLYYYYY
Hey Hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay is very funny.
This is Long Term Booking!!
Genial
Wrong crowd for this though
It couldn't have happened to a better guy🤣
I had a feeling it was coming I’m not surprised this is going to be one hell of a rivalry ❤❤❤❤
Roman vs jimmy for championships  😂
That first kick was out of anger, the second one was PERSONAL
Paul Hayman has the best facial reactions in all of TV. He looks like 3 ghosts just showed up at his house on Xmas eve or something
Mejor tarde que nunca jimmy logro alejar a su hermano de roman, que sigue ahora.i
Wow the story finally curved. Finally jimmy
Too bad the guy in the truck got the wrong angle so we didn't see that moment.
Main event Jimmy Uso
Everyone talking about roman and jimmy rivalry what about solo that got super kicked 😂
The heritage of WWE !
FI👏🏽NAL👏🏽LY👏🏽
Let the Uso Penitentiary be opened again, and let its first prisoner be Roman Reigns.
It was a matter of time before he exploted. This is getting good. I love it.
Dude…. Sami was right all along and jimmy just proved it right there
I love it
Well down jimmy u step u the man must fealt good step up to your kuzen hell yea
Finally
I ended up burning the sausages i had on the grill outside because i was watching this storyline unfold and the bloodline implode before our very own eyes. Yes, yes, yes, yes... Jimmy finally did what Jay should have done. Between Sami having his moment in front of this crowd was also awesome!!!!
That’s my favorite part 🔥🔥
Brah, the writers and the story lines with the Bloodline is absolutely amazing. I’m a longtime wrestling fan since the late 70’s till now and I’m loving what I’m watching right now. 😍👍🏼
Paul Heyman’s expressions are priceless
JIMMY WARNED ROMAN HE'S NOT JEY!!!!!
You gotta give it to Roman, a great storyteller, I acknowledge him
Whaaaat ?
I've got one way to describe that super kick and that is AWESOME. Jimmy literally sent Reigns out of the Penitentiary with that Kick.
The crowd reaction was awesome!
WHAT DID I JUST WITNESS THE BLOODLINE IS GONNA BE BROKEN
Roman bout to get Jimmy's A*S
Yes yes yes yes finally Roman got what he deserves
Give solo titles thanks to USOS
The plot thickens!!!!
All Romans fault.
I so love this!!!!!!  Bro said I got you!!!!!!! This storyline is EPIC ❤❤❤❤
Damn that was a surprise right there Sami Zayn was right all of long
WWE please don’t screw this up. We are tired of The Bloodline.
Jimmy for the universal championship and Jey for the WWE championship 🔥🔥🔥🔥
THIS IS CERTIFIED WWE CLASSIC
Let's acknowledge Jimmy USO for what he did
Jey now jimmy 😮 it all leads to Solo doing the same thing and then we might see The Rock after all 😊
The Island of Relevancy is sinking down to Davy Jones’ locker, and Roman has no one to blame but himself. He pushed and pushed and pushed, until Jimmy snapped.
The bloodline no more. This is for when Roman Reigns put Jimmy Uso in that submission hold to make Jay quit.  Now Jay and Solo nee6to get on code because immediately bloodline is closer than distance bloodline.  Coming from the same loins is stronger than some relative not directly bloodline. If Solo ho against his siblings that will create more chaos and divisiveness in the bloodline.  Roman Reigns wouldn't held the titles the long if the the bloodline didn't helped him retained the titles.
Omgggg 😂
about time i called it
Superkick Destruction!
Finally something good
Finally. End of the bloodline.
One more time jimmmnyy
He’s gonna regret that I’m guessing
LETS GO
Roman Reigns had it coming 😂
Park Heyman is the best😂
I love this good for Jimmy I'm happy what he did
I like how Roman Reigns not only sold the kick but the sadness and anguish from the betrayal. He wasn't even shocked, he was just in despair
Roman had it coming! Bloodline is no more!
Good about time
I have watched this accountles times.  I hate Roman the way he disrespects the usos
This saga and story of Bloodline deserves an Oscar, because it is worthy of Cinema. Thank you Triple H! This PPV Night of Champions was spectacular.
About time
Dude I know I CANT BE THE ONLY ONE who has REWATCHED jimmy SUPERKICK THIS MAN OVER AND OVER LIKE YESSSSSSS😭🔥 Master Storytelling at its finest
This was truly epic. Even Paul at ringside, going "Wh- wh- why?!"
This is pure greatness. Roman is becoming one of the greatest storytellers of all time. When Jim kicked him the second time, I just felt like he shot the king. Wonderful. This is why wwe is the best show on earth.
THE BLOODLINE IS CRUMBLED!!! Lesss Gooooo
I definitely thought Jey was gonna do this a long time ago, but aye “what are brothers for”
Jimmy’s true he should have done that a long time ago
Could you imagine the POP this would have been in the US?  It was great there, but would have crazy loud here.
i think jimmy has snapped.even jey couldnt believe what he did.jimmy WILL  regret it come monday .because remember they also superkicked solo and aint no way solo will forgive that
Honestly Jey’s reaction n how Jimmy is looking like he exercising demons after that kick. How cathartic it was for him. Their growth and evolution has been impressive
" I got you"   Goosebumps right there
Jimmy is out of his mind for doing this cos i feel roman reign is gonna punish em and now we are gonna see the ferocious part of him i assure you.
LETS GOOOOOO JIMMY DONT GIVE A FU** BOUT NO TRIBAL CHIEF THAT SECOND KICK WAS CRAZZYYY
It finally happened
Yes great Job Jimmy
Main event jimmy and jey uso are back with bloodline crumbling.
WWE finally got a good storyline
Jimmy just turned super saiyan mode!!
Looks like I was right
« IM DOING WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE A LONG TIME AGO!! » that hit HARD
I like how Jimmy was the one to finally break when most assumed it would be Jey. I'm surprised Jey still feels conflicted and was shouting at Jimmy for doing it. That second kick topped it off!
That was a Wrestlemania moment, that was the moment for the ages. The Bloodline just came crashing down and the second kick to Reigns and the scream from Jimmy after was just pure emotion pouring from him.
The best moment of 2023
Oh my, my. This is intense, I've watched 4 times and am going to watch it again.
IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!! Roman disrespected the Usos one time too much, a gor 2 superkicks .. the storyline has been epic, now it gets even better WOW 💯
This is all I can say.  THANK YOU JIMMY!!!!!!
This definitely the greatest. Let’s have a conversation about Roman & the Usos being top 50 all time
The bloodline is end roman no
I’m surprise they pulled the trigger on this at Night of Champions. I thought that they would do this at Summerslam but I’m here for it! I haven’t popped like that for wrestling in an extremely long time. The Bloodline story is so damn good!! I miss having genuinely exciting stories happen in WWE!!!
Take that B**ch Roman!!!
Yes it’s about time
Bro
Jimmy uso had so much anger that he got angry and kicked roman in the face
Those just primal screams after the second kick, man.
Jimmy Legend Uso 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
And yes Jimmy is referring to 2020, it started with Jey and not it ends with Jimmy
Roman deserve this, and all you hardcore Roman fans know it lol.
Jimmy & Sami did something that Jey couldn’t do since day one where things all started at
So glad that the Bloodline is finished.
MONSTER POP.
They r gonna get in trouble cause they just did that to the tribal chief
Thank you Jimmy. Thank you 🙏 The Usos will split the WWE Championship and the Universal Championship
I mean now it's official. The bloodline is done for good. Jimmy has had enough. He's not like Jay. He's going to stick up for his brother and he's just had enough Roman and now this gives opportunity for somebody like Cody who's been trying to get back into title contention against Roman to fight his way back to him
I wanted Jay to do it whose with me
I literally screamed "FINALLY" when Jimmy super kicked the life out of Roman. Years of story telling built up to this moment. Its on the level of Ciampa vs Gargano back in 2018. Along with Jimmy screaming "I’M DOING WHAT I’VE SHOULD’VE DONE A LONG TIME AGO!” was bone chilling. I thought it would have been Jey who did it but I wasn't prepared for Jimmy to do it
Finaly
They had no other choice but to attack him
Jimmy: I'm the NEW Tribal Chief now! 😂
Hey ain't slick lol he told Jimmy he has to do better than that after that first kick 🤭 and jimmy saying I got u uce
about time! screw Roman lames!
What did i say now roman vs jimmy at money in the Bank please  wwe Listen to me that will be great. The Beginning of the end for the Bloodline Has arived
I said it. I said that Jimmy would be the one to do it. Errbody said it would be Jey.... nah fam. Jey's already broken. Hold Jimmy's beer, he got this
I was here live. The whole place was shaking from every screaming and cheering
yesss!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣 uceeeee
I KNEW IT!
OMG.
Cool laid back Jimmy done went crazy.
Should've been Jey to pull the trigger on Roman. That could've brought the bloodline storyline around full circle
deserved
LOVE THIS STORY LINE!!!! Instant CLASSIC!!
Rikishi’s  sons are good
Perfecto Jimy usos
Jimmy is a whole menace to susiedy😶😶😶😊
Jimmy uso finally did the job. thank you!
I'm screaming!!.. The 1st kick was insane, but the 2nd kick made me jump out off my seat. LETS GOOOOOO!!!
Man it's going to make me want to watch Friday SmackDown. It's going to be good. God is going to be so much to talk about the bloodline now I mean for good reasons because now Jimmy is going to be fighting against Roman and you know Jay is going to be on the side with Jimmy. He can't he eat siding with his against his own twin his brother
Heyman in the background 😭😭
This is pure cinema
Finally 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Took long enough
YES
Dope. Jey got like some Stockholm syndrome stuff going on. Jimmy finally seeing through it
100 out of 10 this is probably one of the best stories WWE has told
Really, this is no surprise to anyone and if any WWE fans were surprised then you aren't a real wrestling fan. As I have said months ago they were waiting for day 1,000 of his reign to end it all.
Jey uso vs Roman reigns. Summerslam. Reigns wins but cody cash in to become new champion.
Looks like the Bloodline has finally snapped, cracked, & popped like Rice Krispies Cereal known as Jimmy Uso superkick Roman Reigns after slapping Jey Uso's face & now ready to leave the Bloodline. Hashtag for Jey Uso in the style of WWE Hall Of Famer Bill Goldberg known as Jey Uso leaving the Bloodline after Sami Zayn & Jimmy Uso IS NEXT!
I CAN SMELL... The end of the Bloodline right here
This storyline is pure perfection everything form the emotions and the crowd popping of when jimmy super kicked Roman . This will definitely be talked about in years to come
Roman reigns' ghosts are coming back to haunt him
Watched this about 3 times🤣🤣🤣
What a masterpiece!
Finally
6 words: C I N E M A
Good
That scream Jimmy let out at 0:56 had so much emotion🔥 It really felt like all his anger and frustration from being used by  Roman came out at once.
I loved that Jimmy made his decision while Jey hasn’t yet. This will put Jimmy in the same position his brother was in a few years ago. Just the roles will be reversed
usos got sum to do roman gonna be angry
Weather yall like or hate agree or disagree with what I'm bout 2 say  Idgaf  1. There's gonna be hell 2. If a family member or a friend  Or a stranger disrespect me  Or crosses the line  They gonna get got  That's my Tough love  That my Wrath 😈
YES
Perfect storytelling, brilliant ending...what a storyline the bloodline has been
About time.
I hope jimmy uso doesn't turn back after this.
Just wish Jey would have joined in on the 2nd kick but this was amazing
Backstabber
About time. The bloodline has to be the worst faction in history
The bloodline is ending
Jey for years been mentally tortured by roman when jimmy wasn't around , Jimmy the older twin knew what time it was and never forgotten at all , i felt that I got you part because he his the big brother of both jey and solo , just let cody be Roman at summer slam it be picture perfect as a storyline can get
This storyline just keeps getting better and better
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Good night, blue cheese.
Everyone but Jey be standing up to Roman smh
We all thought it was Jey who would do it and Jimmy came in sleeper cell status.
I think it's safe to say that this is what we ALL wanted!
This gave me chills and deserving of two amazing back-to-back pops
The only thing that would've made this better is if Roman lost the championship at WM. His downfall is going to be swift.
Jey vs roman did Jey win? Let see if Jimmy can end the title reign
Only thing that would’ve made this moment better is if Sammy pinned Roman
Its about god damn time
I don't wanna hear no more about Romans title reign being boring,stuff like this has solidified this as one of the greatest title reigns ever.
What a beautiful family moment.  Jimmy's turn to battle the TC.  Now this really gets interesting
I knew the bloodline would collapse like this
Heyman in the back. What a master of his craft. All these guys, this is the only thing im keeping up with in wrestling these days, reminds me of the old days.
It’s about damn time
it was jimmy's story all along!!! i had a feeling it wouldnt have been jey and it turned out to be true!
Are Kevin Owens & Sami Zayn Still Tag Team Champions?
And the award for best turn in wwe history goes to Jimmy Uso
I suspect Roman is going to blame not only Jimmy/Jey but also Solo for the L. Solo will soon be turning away from Roman as well. Just a matter of time. And, if Solo truly loves his brothers more than his cousin, it will happen sooner than later. Keep watching…👀
Jimmy Uso would've end up like Sami Zayn
Everybody always assuming it's jey but I'm starting to believe Jimmy is the true one to finally detrone roman it's obvious
THE SUPERKICK HEARD AROUND THE WORLD! FINALLY!
This whole storyline is epic storytelling whoever wrote this laid this out needs a raise the only thing I would have done differently is do this a month earlier at wrestlemania to give cody redemption and make this moment a wrestlemania moment but none the less still awsome
Bien conchetumareeee
I wasn't expecting much from this event but man it was good. And the ME wasn't the best match but the story was on point. Now I really want to know what's gonna happen next.
Yeah yeah we need the old uso back . Roman your nothing .
THANK GOD HHH IS RUNNING THE SHOW!!!!!!!!!!
Probably there best storyline since 2002 .. but it’s still no where near the attitude era or wcw days
This was entirely to predictable...as I was watching the match I knew exactly what was going to happen and how it was going to happen ...could've been a better approach like the brothers turning on each other
Looks Like There Is No More Of The Bloodline!!!!
About time, this storyline needs to end and Roman needs to go away
Wow. I haven’t marked out like that in ages
0:41 "LISTEN TO ME, LISTEN TO ME, *LISTEN TO ME USE!* I'M DOIN. WHAT YOU SHOULD'VE DONE. A LONG TIME AGO! *I GOTCHU!!!"* _- Jimmy Uso_
As the days go by and they keep telling this story, it gets better and better and I’m having a really hard time keeping these alligators down lol. But no jokes aside, I’ve said it before this storyline needs a HOF slot on it’s own it’s been THAT GREAT
Injustice leads to justice . Roman has enjoyed a title reign over injustice so let him see justice
*Cinema. Absolute cinema.*
Sami get all da credit for this one
Long overdue! Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy!! lol 😂
Oh my God nooooooooooo
Jimmy Uso just snapped
People are gonna go haywire as they usually do especially when it just happened but idc what anyone says too predictable and a little bit too early. Wasn't exactly shocked and long term I think it'll be a mistake.
“I’m doing what u should of did a long time ago” I GOT U! Smack down finto be one hell of a show this week
OMFG🤯🤯🤯🤯
he should've done that when he returned from his injury in 2021. but better late then never, right? well done, Jimmy, the REAL head of  the table
Epic
This STORYLINE just gets better and better. When u thought it was gonna be Jey, it was Jimmy! I'M DOING WHAT U SHOULD'VE DID A LONG TIME AGO! I GOT U! The Usos just gave themselves another push. Mannnnnnnn. When he screamed...bruh goosebumps. Haven't been this invested in a story line since Daniel Bryan. (SuperKick ×2) Roman selling everything. I remember when Roman couldnt even talk on the mic, now the dude is by far the biggest heel of all time!
Weeeeeh all the Tribal Queef Fanboys crying in the comments News Flash, Us: Y'all are the casual fans up in here, not us. Coz if you were real fans & not a bunch of Aesthetic Chasers, you would've realized by now that this was all about elevating the Usos FROM DAY 1!! Reigns 1000 Days Reign of being Champion, has been super kicked off the Island of Relevancy
Yyyeeeeeeessssssssssss tribal chief jimmy uso☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽
I was hoping for this and it happened i hope they join zamy and ko
I’m not a uso fan by anything but I loved this omg Roman deserve everything he gets you go jimmy
Well done.  To all involved. Heyman spicing it up just with his facial expressions on the outside.    So many memorable moments of this entire storyline.  Appreciate it now.  It'll never happen again.
Acknowledged them!!!!!!!
Did the crowd chant "alqaraf almuqadas"?
About damn time
Whole time I thought jey was the wild card but it really is Jimmy 😂😂
all time best superkick🎉
This is awesome 🎉
It's about time..... roman needed that 🙌 👏
This storyline is 🔥🔥🔥
Esto ya no es cine, es una obra de arte 🚬🗿
The Bloodline has disintegrated
Yes yes yes it had to been done hats off jimmy
The moment we all been waiting for
The best storyline bro 😂
No tribal cheef can go between brother love
Well it's about damn time
Ric flair voice "wooOoooOooo"
After jimmy gives the second super kick to Roman, you hear jimmy yell all the frustration,  anger and hurt he has been keeping inside for a while. Sometimes you don’t need words to convey a story. Amazing performance by Jimmy.
🤣🤣🤣 Roman Reigns had this betrayel coming for 3 years now I never thought Jimmy would lose it thanks to Kevin Owens.
That’s what you get Roman Reigns for been selfish 😂 you can’t eat your cake 🍰 and have it.
That scream after the second kick was feral and dope
Triple H said the story was going to go somewhere and it was going to be told very beautifully and he wasn't wrong
Was anyone else watching this footage on repeat multiple times?
Yooooooo, I knew Jimmy was gonna turn his back on Roman Reigns
Whatever it takes. As long as this FINALLY starts the end goal of Roman losing, I'm all for it. Thanks, Jimmy Uso.
NOOOOOOOO
Incredible loved it
Ngl....Roman had this coming
I just keep rewat hing it, it was perfect.. just this storyline deserves to be on monday and friday
The betrayal was absolutely fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well done jimmy!!! Finally this storyline is about to have the bigger POP and I’m ready for it !!!!!!
Best moment of the night
FINALLY BEEN WAITING FOR THIS TO HAPPEN
The arena exploded. The most controversial ending of a storyline. Now this is one hell of a ending of a storyline. The Bloodline is over.  Credits to Sami Zeyn who start the whole thing. Can't wait for Friday. The celebration will be absolute smash! It's time for Roman to lose.
9 years later roman reigns gets betrayed lol
As Cody said, There's cracks in the armor. Holes in the scales. Because of Sami. And it showed big time here.
this is story telling champagne
En efecto, es cine 🚬
Finally, the Bloodline is over!!
THIS IS CINEMA!
ITS HOGAN WITH THE LEG DROP ALL OVER AGAIN!!! 😮.   ok not really im over exaggerating...  BUT IT ALMOST FEEL LIKE THAT MOMENT IN TIME!!  (jim ross voice OH MY GAWD!!"
Rip The bloodline

Jimmy Uso your next heavyweight champion
I QUIT MATCH ALL OVER AGAIN !!!!!!
OOOOHHHHH MYYYY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDD YESSSSSSSSSSS
Beautiful JIM What took you you so long ?
i just freaked out
Its the scream at the end for me yes.....that second kick needs to be on reply....snap back to reality.
Awe superman punch is gonna be all alone lol
Jimmy, Jay, and Jacob Fatu anyone?
main event jimmy has arrived
This should happened maybe 500 days ago the story is too long and become boring… it’s good story but 1000 days with less than 30 title defend and less than 5 clear win without help really too same… poor Seth wins a no main event championship 😢
Bout time Jimmy USO
Bien muchachos hagan su propia historia
Jimmy is realizing that he's telling his brother Jey that he doesn't want to see Roman using him as a punching bag anymore and Jey feels pretty clueless right now
This is the end of the bloodline. Roman losing is just the beginning
Solo will turn on Roman and then Heyman will mange Solo
"I'm doing, what you should've done, *a long time ago!!"*
YAAAAAAAAASSSS!!!! IT'S ABOOT DAMN TIME, JIMMY! YA FINALLY SUPERKICK THE 98LB HEAD ROMAN REIGNS! TWICE!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Super kicks are so disrespectful 😭
CINEMA
Finallyyyyy
Dood that was so insane when I saw it the usos finally swapped best thing of night of champions
Roman Reigns got kick by the Usos lose the match  solo sikoa got kick too by bloodline Roman Reigns not very happy put it was good match Kevin owen and sami Zayn the winner night of championship WWE
Superkick Party!
Im gonna do what you should of done USss A long time AGO!....I Got You!....🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jimmy Uso said that Tears it
Much deserved
The screams from jimmy is healing
Yamete kudasai uwu 💕
Well there goes one of the best thing wwe had. They going to take another decade to make a good storyline and faction.
Best thing my eyes have seen 😅😅😅😅😂😂😂hell yea!!!💪🏽🤜🏽🤛🏽✊🏾👊🏾
And all of these will come all together with the Rock
Paul Heyman's emotion is 10/10 throughout all of this
😨😨😨😨
I would have done the same thing for my brother, no question.
I was secretly waiting for Jey to do it but I had the same reaction as Paul heyman after it happened
BIGGEST MISTAKE OF HIS LIFE! 🤯🤯🤯
Solo is about to go ape$#!+ 😅
I’M BEEN WAITING FOR JIMMY TO TURN UP FOR A LONG TIME!!! LET’S GOOOOOO UCE!!!!!!
LETS FUKN GO!!!!!!!!! ☝️
Man .. Saudi did not deserved this moment
He did it twice😂😂😂 Jimmy vs Jey at SummerSlam🔥🔥
This is HISTORY
That look on Jimmy's face after the first superkick and him telling Jey this is what he should've done a long time ago was icing on the 🎂
I barely watch the product these days but check in from time to time and this storyline is something else. And Jimmy USO, kudos son that was one of the best moments I have seen in years. He had his moment and he absolutely nailed it. God I am hyped after seeing that.😊
The thumbnail is awfull
Jimmy true tribal chief
That was pure emotion from Jimmy.  Loved every minute of it
Let the games begin
That's the brother Jay turned his back on a friend for, the one Jay tucked his tail between his legs and humbled himself to protect, sticking up for his brother and taking no guff any more.   All this time we've been praising Jay for his work put into this story and Jimmy just stepped up and said he's no Jannetty.  Day One Is H!
Sami zyan prediction went to spoiler real quick 😜
Lets not forget the true hero of this match and thats solo. Bro just got abused and took all that smoke. True MVP
Jimmy has put himself into my good books he should be the one to dethrone Roman for one of his titles
Jey so tired of all them mofos! He can't win for nothing😂 My poor Jey. The psychological damage he's been taking is insane. They bout to drive him insane! Jey still the one that everybody in The Bloodline counts on, though. He just needs to quit them fools😂😂😂 I love this storyline!
Jimmy Uso is least a beast inside of himself. Look at Jey look so shock
KO and Sami watching the madness unfolds 😂😂
The storytelling of the bloodline has been absolutely perfect.
This story can go on a long time with  twist. Best story ever told in wrestling
Baby face turn for Jimmy and jey
OMG Jimmy Uso had enough of  Roman reigns using the Usos😮
Moments like this right here are why I love pro wrestling. This is the most fun I’ve had watching wwe in a long time.
I was cheering for Jimmy It's about Damn time they stood up to Roman. Did anyone hear Jey scream "Joe!!!" as Jimmy was pushing him up the ramp?
NO I WANTED ROMAN TO BECOME THE BEST UNDISPUTED TAG TEAM CHAMPIONS!!!
And THERE IT IS!!!✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿 🤘🤘🤙🤙👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I knew one of them was gonna snap. Highly interested to see where this goes now.
Jimmy's climb to the top begins
Man Roman Reigns definitely did cross the line there hitting and shoving Jey then Jimmy comes up behind Roman and super kicks him Sami Zayn was right about the bloodline falling apart man what a turn of events I knew it was bound determined to happen sooner or later and Roman Reigns definitely got what he deserved and then Jimmy super kicks Roman again
he said "there aint no more day 1" and  jimmy took that personally
Love it ❤
I’m with Jimmy 🔥🔥
YEEEEEES FINALLY!!!!
Perfect history..
FINALLY
He snapped !! 😂🔥🔥🔥🔥
rr pushing them tooooooooooooooo far. jimmy rocks!
One Kick to the End of the Bloodline
I knew this day would come.
Brilliant.
Good for u uso and jimmy use do it too
I know when Jimmy let out that scream at the end, it felt so damn good.
I acknowledge you, Jimmy Uso!
Crowd is sleep 😂😂
Loved this so much bloodline story is the greatest wwe story ever idc what nobody gotta say
I love it! Jey has.stayed with Roman because he's been afraid of what Roman would do to Jimmy if he left, but now Jimmy has had enough and Jey knows whats going to happen next and he's terrified
BEST WWE MATCH I HAVE EVER ENJOY 😉 😊 ❤😊 ROMAN REIGNS EGO IS JUST TOO MUCH.  LOVE YOU JIMMY ❤
GOOD!! Jimmy Uso earn my R.E.S.P.E.C.T
That's what's up ❤❤❤
It’s about damn time 🤡🤡 Roman deserves it
IT TOOK THEM SO LONG
Awesome that's a good story line
We're all happy that Seth got his well-deserved belt tonight. But when this happened, I forgot about the rest of the night and was only looking forward to Friday now 😂. Oh ya, can we please get a thank you, Asuka, for taking the belt from Bianca finally. 😂
PROUD OF YOU JIMMY! PROUD OF YOU BOY!
Hoy ganó el Wrestling 🚬🗿
I’m glad jimmy didn’t take the bullying anymore by tribal chef
But even though roman was wrong....Jimmy was worse...everytime the uso's get involved,everything just turns into a mess for the bloodline.
Probably what Kevin said to the uso got in Jimmy's head and realizing 2020 what roman did to them
I’ve always liked Jimmy more than I did Jey, and Jimmy is right he did what Jey should’ve done in the first place
Hell yeah yeahhhhhhh
This is how you slowly get your fan base back, WWE. You better keep it up cause your product is stale.
Awesomeness!!!!! 😲😊👍👌😎✊👊🍁
Who won the tag titles though
Such much emotion in that scream.
The writers for this storyline deserve a giant pay rise because this has been the most compelling thing WWE have ever done in recent years 👏
jey will become universal champion , the man who got beaten by roman reigns and will beat roman reighns
CINEMA.
Jimmy is officially my hero!!!!!!!!! All you Roman fans can suck it 😂😂😂😂😂 now we can see how good Roman truly is without help
Jimmy always has his brothers back but not his uncle Roman
🫢😬😮😮
It started with Jey! It should end with Jey!!!
If this includes the word "cucumber" at ANY point, im out.
YES YES YES.  ROMAIN TOO ARROGANT.
About damn time, bloodline is slowly imploding
Romans selling is somthing els.
When Jimmy told Jey I got you and then proceeded to super kick Roman again was absolute perfect story telling.
Seems that someone is waking up
We all knew that was going to happen.. Jim or jey will take the title from Roman.. and Cody go take the belt from Seth
Imagine if, at the end of the story, both brothers leave with the title 🤞🏾
ahhhhh carambaaaaaaaaaa
After Sami stepped up to Roman at the Rumble. The USO twins always be gettung put down by their cousine. Things be building up and Jimmy's been like, "Fine... Ill do it my self!" Its about damn time!!!
Roman vs Jimmy at MITB 🔥👏
YAAAAS …Jimmy OMG!!! I love this. Roman is a bully not a leader and he put his hands on Jey in front of Jimmy for the last time. I could watch that last super kick and Jimmy scream the roar of someone overcoming their oppressor over and over again. F that guy the USO’s don’t need him
He spoke facts 💯🥳
Can we just talk about how great this card was? It felt like such a big deal, and it's not even one of the big four! Lots of great matches, stellar storytelling in the main and co-main event.. it was a delight to watch.
I'd be lying if I said I didn't replay this video an unreasonable amount of times. Jimmy seeing Jey just getting bullied and finally having enough will go down in history as the greatest face turns of all time.
This should've happened at Wrestlemania with Cody winning both belts.
This should've happened in the US, the crowd pop would've been INSANE
Sami and ko and Cody predicted this don't know why yall shocked it was going to happen eventually
Long over due
Down Goes Roman! Down Goes Roman! Down Goes Roman!
This was almost as big as the Sami pop at royal rumble. This is what GOOD storylines do. Invested fan bases will go crazy when a moment happens! Look at the infinity saga in marvel for example.
Cinema
Best part of the night jimmy kicking Tribal Queen but very underwhelming show , GUNTHER is a certified baddass and makes every opponent look good as he looks GREAT!!
Good job Jimmy, Roman  taste Your own medicine
The greatest Storyline in the modern era has been transported into the next and perhaps the most powerful level. From Roman’s return at SummerSlam 2020 to Night of Champions and to the continuation, The Bloodline Storyline is more incredible.  Give them an Emmy or an Oscar! ASAP!
Best of 2023🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊
Letsss goooooooo
Well done WWE
If Randy returns and reigns is still champ ima need that legend killer gimmick back against god mode reigns
The beginning of the end of Romans reign
The shock to all shockers!!😮😮
Jimmy just let it all out, WE AIN'T NOBODY'S BXTCH UCE!! My favorite occurrence from the PLE... PERIODT
0:09 0:52
Holy phucking shxt! This is unreal!!!   Is Jey gonna turn on his Bro for the first time in their Pro Wrasslin career? Or is Reigns gonna push him one step further & he finally snaps..  " Stay tuned for scenes from the next episode of Dragon Ball Z! "
Himothy Uso
This ONE for the BOOKS!! Undeniable CLASSIC!
Now cousin are fighting each other’s. What’s a SHAME!!!!!!
I knew it was going to happen one day the usos were already on the edge all it took was a small push either way w night of champions
Finally, the end is nigh.
That's what I'm talking about right there that is good it's overweight Goodbye💯💯💔💔
I Said this was going to happen last week 😂 & Seth was going to win so he can be the face of raw & roman the face of smack down
Long live JIMMY 😊 for the joy he just gave me 😂
How many Stars for this Match?
I saw this wasn't good on The Usos part do that to boss Roman Reigns.If was The Usos don't show up at work when Roman Reigns and Solo and Wiseman Paul Heyman there.He not going to be in good mood next week.
this is the absolutely most amazing, intrigueing , and breath taking storyline wwe has ever created
About time
Wow wwe really starting to pull it out the bag everytime now it's feels like old times again.
Porfin
About god damn time!! Cant wait to see what the next chapter holds. This video is gunna go down in the books as a classic.
This is FREAKING PEAK. This storyline blow up sky-high. Another LEVEL
Yes Kevin owen and sami Zayn the winner the winner night of championship
So freaking long overdue awesome work jimmy
Greatest Betrayals Of All Time.
Looks like it's just the table cause the head got kicked off 😏
@TheOscars  @Hollywoodreporter  @WillSmith  @LoganPaul  @JakePaul  @WWEGames
The Bloodline Civil War Begins
Idk if Roman seen stars or the whole galaxy after those kicks
This split had to happen after Roman lost his title. Excitement aside, the timing was too late.
🎉set up mach
Endlich 🎉
I’ve been waiting for at least a year now.
This will sit right above Rollins heel turn 😱
Totally shocked,but Roman had this voting, no doubt.
Nah can’t blame him would’ve done the same if he lays hands on my brother
Es cine gente
I am confused by Jey's reaction. Why didn't he join in to kick Roman's face?
AMAZING
Brothers always got each other's back
It was the inevitable for months and it finally happened. All stables implode and eventually end. From DX, The Nation of Domination, Evolution, The Authority. I can go on and on. All things must come to an end. It was bound to happen. Not surprised it happen. It wasn't just a matter of IF the WWE was going to end it, but when and it it finally happened. THE END of The Bloodline.
🥺🥺🥺
So good 😊
Jimmy Uso is right
Paul Heyman face 😂..
Doubling up was the 👨🏿‍🍳👌🏿 😁😅
I feel the scream from jimmy 😮‍💨🤌🏽
Yes jimmy kicked Roman
This is WWE! Perfect!!!
I keep rewind it, finally it happened
That boy jimmy got fed up
Everyone knew this was gonna happen!
I really love the way Jimmy kicks Roman head off his neck
Absolutely beautiful and love it ❤❤❤ the Usso we’re tired of Roman antics and being manipulated
Jimmy unleashed
they finally imploded
Welp guess he had that a coming
Omg 😆
Roman Reigns had this coming for a long time, the bloodline is officially dead 😏
Roman as always ends up being betrayed !!
The I got you did it for me i yelled like YEAAAAAAHHHH!!! THATS YO BROTHA!!
this was too obvious tho💀
Jimmy 👎 roman reigns and jey uso
Hell yeah!
The bloodline is broken up
The superkick would lay people out 20 years ago.  Now it doesnt even finish them.
I thought jimmy would screw roman over but I didn't think like this. Amazing storytelling. This is gonna start a feud between jimmy and reigns however garra that jey will try to reconcile with reigns and then will realise that jimmy and sami were right. Hope we can see jimmy, sami, KO and jey all on the same page by next week, if not just the first three and they all devise a plan to get jey on terms
Now I see why the Usos dropped the belts to Zayn and Owens.
Danggg
Well, the bloodline officially has a carotid artery lol 🩸
I guess Jey forgot what happened to him in 2020
Jey can only take so much, he's been tugged by everyone and Roman started this whole "reign" off him...his emotions are gonna put a end to all of this. Square one back from the beginning.
Thank God NOC was in Saudi so I could watch this masterpiece happen live in the UK without having to wait until 1am
Certified superkick right😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 yes WWE.........🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think Roman just met his new challenger!!
I knew one of them if not both of them was gonna snap eventually. Roman has really abused them both since they lost the titles at Wrestlemania...
🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 this is cinema
Yes yes yes...  Roman would not be champ if it wasnt for the constant interference and cheating.  No more 4 on 1. Best thing to happen in wwe in forever.
It’s official. The bloodline is over. Reigns get ready to defend U’re Undisputed Championship Titles against U’re own Cousins.
Finally yes
HELL YEAH
He got what he deserves for treating his bloodline members like trash
Jimmy got that DAAWWWGG IN HIM
The second kick and the yelling all to stand up for his brother! Perfect storytelling!!! 👏👏
whelp nothing has changed, roman always gets betrayed by someone. poor roman
And story loading
Bro i don't know how i knew it was coming but I still felt shocked
I froze it not better than when sami turned on Roman but good
sami was right all along,the bloodline is crumbling down
Thank you Jimmy!!!!
LISTEN UCE IM DOING WHAT YOU SHOULD'VE HAVE DONE A LONG TIME AGO I GOTCHU UCE *PROCEEDS TO DELIVER A PERFECT SUPERKICK  MAGNIFICENT STORY TELLING 👏
통쾌하다 블러드라인 해체 시작했구나 로만도 타이틀 내려놓을때다 섬머슬램에서 도전자나 머니인더뱅크 우승자에게 타이틀 바뀌었으면 한다
Rocky you gotta talk to your little cousin!!! Somebody gotta straighten him out
Finally
1 GRAMMY FOR BLOODLINE❤
Heyman be lookin like his world just collapsed in on him
Well this was a long time coming, the bloodline has officially ended
"I did it for The Rock."
😮😮😮😮😮😨😨😨😨😰😰😰
Bloodline still sucks. They should have ended the bloodline months ago.
Damn!
I think Jimmy finally understands why Sami did what he did
bet that felt good
Corey graves need to stop over Exaggerate all the time talking about "Jimmy what did you do" like it isn't obvious🤦🏾‍♂️😆😆
Now we Will see the real Roman
Goated!
This story remind of the Evolution story as far as how good it is this is really good 💯
Paul Heyman’s facial expression barely changed throughout this whole moment
that was crazy
Thank you this bloodline bs is over
Perfect
Beautiful...
This certified wwe classic is gonna be remembered for a long time
Let the civil bloodline war begin now!!!!!!
Been waiting for it, but I thought it'd be Jay that finally gave him a reality check, that "head of the table" went to his head; "absolute power corrupts absolutely".....😐
dang crack
The Bloodline Civil War has begun
es demasiado cine
And they said this storyline won’t have layers, this is CRAZY Jimmy kicks Roman not Jey wow
Thank  god
Predictable as always gimme some wrestling goddammit
Love it 😊😊😊😊😊
I don’t blame jimmy I hate how Roman be treating them
the feeling i got when he super kicked roman is something i don’t even think i can describe, it was amazing!! can’t wait to see what comes NEXT
The adrenaline rush my body was in the moment I see Jimmy superkicked Roman is understandable. This is no question one of the most classic and iconic moment in WWE history
When Jey said to Jimmy "You got to do better than that!" I thought he was going to superkick Roman too lmao
The BloodLine is over
Before the Bloodline, there was Day One-ish. Usos wore gold since Day One-ish. And for Roman to tell Jey that there ain’t no Day One no more like that? Like he can tear down what the brothers built? Day One was never the problem. Roman was the problem. Wonderful moment in an exceptional story.
Its about time he had been treating them wrong
Too bad it's not going to do anything to Roman's stranglehold over the belts.
The satisfaction I felt when that Superkick connected with Roman's face was unreal + the crowd pop 🔥🔥🔥 UNREAL!!! W JIMMY
Thought jey was the one to turn on roman first but yea go jimmy
imagine Vince still micro-managing creative or being head of it. do you think these golden moments will happen? Hell No.  Well done, Trips. Well done.
The Bloodline nation is in shambles
Jimmy did what Jey should’ve done a long time ago
This is a piece of art
FINALLY
I’ve been watching wrestling for better part of 30 years …. I think I can say this bloodline story is best storyline
I screameddddddddd when Jimmy super kicked Reigns. This is awesome. The tension and feud has been coming for a such a long time. Jimmy is so tired of Reigns controlling the bloodline. It's time for something else. Let's go!!🎉
Looking at the comments sections, I can tell everybody, who's watching wrestling now is only 20 years old to say this, the best story line ever in wrestling history 😂 kids
For those who didn't noticed, after Jimmy superkicks Roman, Jey even said: "Ya gotta do/be better than that"  THAT WAS LIT ASF
FINALLY THE MANS GOT KICKED
A double kick would’ve been better but I’ll take that one lol
"I'm doin' what you should've done a long time ago"  -HIMmy Uso  God level storytelling 🔥
It's about time Jimmy well done WWE
Needed to be done
Whyyy
Yessssssss yessssss
this is definitely a major change in the bloodline. Jimmy Uso kicking Roman Reigns is the most craziest, adrenaline rushing thing I’ve ever seen in wrestling history
Roman deserved it
DELETE THIS!!!🙄😤
What was the song they played with the recap(the tag match) the song talking about everyone wanting to be the goat
This should happen the raw after mania oh snap the bloodline cracking
I love it!!!!!
👍👍👍🤩🤩🤩
This is the first time i've been unable to wait for a Monday Night Raw this year.
MAAAN I WAIT THIS MOMENT FOR SO LOOOOOOONG, TELL HIM JIMMY, TELL HIM!
And now weve gotta wait until Friday. Sometimes I hate the brandsplit
If you're excited about what you just watched, give me a hell yeah!
This moment right here…
Each member of the bloodline getting their time to shine. First Roman, then Jey, now Jimmy. Next will be Solo and that will be epic
Jimmy or Jey or both them should be the ones to dethrone Reigns and send him to Hollywood.
Bom trabalho jimmy
Gracias jimmy
He kicked him
Now this is where the fun begins.
I just can’t get over what we just witnessed an hour ago. Jimmy went UCEY, that’s right I said it, UCEY on the Tribal Chief. Good for you, Jimmy, you SUPERKICKED Roman’s teeth down his throat!!
To be honest it kinda hurts to watch the bloodline fall apart but it also kinda feels good to watch it but i like Roman and it would be nice to have a record for the longest title run in wwe and undisputed title run and after that then Roman could drop the titles
Bout time
Finally the end is here
Jimmy just took Jeys Place at the table.
He really super kicked him... I'm in shock. Did this really just happen... ???!!!!
its come full circle
the bloodline is now defeated and done for
Jey has watched Sami betray Roman ,now he has seen Jimmy do it. They both done something he shouldve done a long time ago.
YES! BOUT TIME!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This is Cinema
“I’M DOIN WHAT YOU SHOULD OF DONE A LONG TIME AGO”   Amazing
I knew it all along 😂😂😂
This entire PPV was actually so entertaining.
Se acabo el linaje al fin reacciono jimmy
The real Tribal Chief has been revealed, it's Jimmy Uso!
Bro I was sitting on the toilet watching this and once jimmy super kicked Roman I jumped up off the seat😂😂😂😂
Omg the family is breaking up😔😭
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Oscar worth performance from jimmy
perfect
Yessssssssssssssssssss
Why Jimmy? Why? And the winner for best heel turn of 2023
This is an incredible moment for the wwe fans
The scream of Jimmy after superkicking Roman was so epic.This will go down one of the greatest moments of wwe history.
Jimmy USO vs Roman Reigns at Money in the bank! That's where Jey gonna turn on Roman Reigns. Then it lead to a Tag team match between USOS vs Solo Sikoa and Roman Reigns at Summerslam. That's where Solo Sikoa gonna turn on Roman Reigns.
Roman desserved every bit of it
Yes, get rid of this Tribal Chief snooze fest storyline
Thank you Jimmy! This is what Jey should’ve done but didn’t because he was trying to protect Jimmy!  Thanks Jimmy!
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yessssssssssssssss Usos turns on Roman
Damn😮😮
Bring back the right hand Man jey uso!!
🤼‍♂️ Royal Rumble all over again! 😄  ... And Jey screams 🗣️ the same Way to Jimmy like he did with Sami! 😁😅    🌟 Perfect delivered!! 🍽️ Thanks WWE! 🤝
YESSSS!! 😳😳😂😂😂🙆🏽‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️
Dude yes!
To be fair Roman Regins did deserve it tbh ✅
Smackdown finna get me ROCKED
It's ABOUT time!
I can't wait to see where it goes from here
YESSSSSSSSSSS
WTF 😮
A heroic betrayal we've all been waiting for since January this year has finally happened HAHAHAHAEEEE
This is awesome 🔥🔥🔥
this is facts what he told Jey
Long time coming
YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!! MY FAITH IN WWE HAS BEEN RESTORED!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤
Leg slaps still a thing? 😂
😂😂😂
"WHEN IT COMES TO THE USOS, I AM THE TRIBAL CHIEF"   - Jimmy Uso
CINEMA.
“Doubling Down” Jimmy Uso!!!!!!
Royal Rumble: Sami hits Roman  NOC: Jimmy hits Roman The Roman empire is falling..😅
predictable this would happen.. Kevin and Sami benefit once again from everyone else getting involved..
About time
Yesssssss!
Yes yes
Can't believe the bloodline storyline can go so long and they still find a way to make it interesting!
This makes the story interesting. Doing what they need to do.
Time for the USOs to get payback on Roman for the embarrassment on smackdown
FINALLY ‼️
"JOE!"😂
I do not know the significance of Sami’s (& KO) entrance but it seamed to mean ALOT with the live crowd in Saudi Arabia!  That’s why I love the WWE UNIVERSE, when the world already has to much division, LEAVE IT TO WWE TO BRING THE WORLD TOGETHER! ❤️
Yes bro very good
Thank you Triple H and whoever else is taking part in presenting this masterpiece to us.
This is how you get people to watch the upcoming shows. I pretty much never watch non-PPVs, but I can't wait to see the fallout from this situation. Roman's about to go nuclear on The Usos
Trouble in paradise
Chimbaaaa marik🤩🤩🤩
Super kick 🦵. Now they can live in their own spot light
...AAAAAAAAND the dissension begins.
Roman has screwed up again.  First, he manages to cause Sami to turn on the Bloodline even when he ensured that Reigns kept his titles.  This also eventually cost the Usos the tag titles.  Now he has lost at least half the Usos and will likely eventually lose Jey as well.
Yo Paul just outside confused as a mf!! Well jey is about to be gone for a week or so like he did after the royal rumble ! Jimmy gonna fight solo on next week smackdown!
Jimmy just had enough
Acknowledge This 0:52
Not gone lie the way the cam was angled made me think jey was gone kick roman too 😅
WWWE JIMMY HAD TO STOP ROMANS ABUSE TO HIS FAMILY HE KEPT PUTTING HIS HAND ON HIS COUSINS AND HAD TO STOO HIS JIMMY IS THE REUE SAMOAN WARRIORS
jimmy a savage i love it
Sooooo does that mean they are uninvited to Romans celebrations on Friday 😂🎉
I acknowledge you Jimmy good job
Acknowledge This 0:09
This was the moment I was waiting for 😍😍😍
This is a storyline that has been incredibly addictive to watch.  Best storyline for a long time.
YESSSSSS FINALLY THE DOWNFALL IS REAL
Grazie Dio che ci hai dato Jimmy usooooo
Who won the match?
Yeah dat more likim
FINALLY
They are going to finally get Roman to be a storyline babyface because the sympathy he will get from the crowd when he loses everything and Solo turns on him. WWE may get the story driven face Reigns they wanted but Bloodline Reigns was needed
Long time coming....tribal chief or not, treating family like they are your subjects goes only so far.....scripted or not scripted there's a breaking point....great story telling..."HHH and Heyman"...🙌🏽
Man that primal scream jimmy let out!!! I felt all the pain being let out.
THIS IS AWESOME!!! X3
Time has come. A very great run!
Yooooooooooo!!!!!! Dude finally snapped 🤣🤣🤣 "im doing what u should of did a long time ago" lmao 🤣 he aint lying!!!! Jimmy wildin
roman had it coming he disrespected jimmy
YES, YES, YES.
OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!!!
They should've of double super kicked him and let Roman take the pin, it wouldn't hurt him to lose in a tag team match.
HUGE spoiler to put as a thumbnail... I thought the event was at night 💀
I cant stop watching Jimmy kick Romans head off!! LETS GO JIMMY!! USOOOOOOOS
Sami Zayn was right all along.
This has been crazy!!!!!
Forrrrrrrr theeeeee TWO TIME?!!!!!  Wow
Bloodline Civil War is here
So I guess it's Jimmy that will dethrone Roman then instead of Jey?
This is karma because roman regin arogan
Yessss jimmyyy ❤❤❤❤❤ and thank you jimmy!
I knew the Usos was going to turn on Roman Reigns.
I don't know how to put in words how happy I am roman stains lost.......jimmy is my favorite uso now srg
I meant put him in his place
It needed to happen.  Enough was enough.
0:52 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊
Jey: We cant do that Jimmy: nah bro I GOTCHU  Jimmy: Does it again  lol
Uceee is on fire 🔥
This is the end of the bloodline 💔
Finally, they dragged this out for far to long.
Its about dam time 💯 let's go Jimmy now Jey its ur turn you know ur brother's right u should have done it long time ago
I'm not gonna lie roman deserved it no wonder jey uso still want to be the one even though they lost 2 times in a row but jimmy had put In his place at night of champions
0:09 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊
What a time to be alive. The Bloodline moments this year alone deserves recognition beyond wrestling.
Attention Vince: keep your old crusty paws OFF of this storyline. Don't let CR anywhere near that title!
Most likely jey will turn on Roman eventually it’s gonna be the same way with Sami he’s gonna do to Roman Sami was right all along
Thank you Triple H
I was waiting for the moment that they both was going to super kick Roman after Jimmy did it
Boring and played out  Racist also Appropriation of black culture
He didn't deserve one but more than two
Hell yeah Jimmy
yeah!!! about time now tell your brother to get with the program and stop being a punching bag
😢and the bloodline is no more.,..
the bloodline's crumbing
I love how jay isnt surprised or shocked, he just knew it had to be done…this is going to be interesting, hats off WWE, good job!
It’s like payback since HIAC 2020
that was the best part
Damnnn...all good things come to an end ☝🏾💔💯
One thing I can say about Jey he’s loyal ash
I love how after Jimmy superkicked Roman the second time, he was screaming like Solo 0:57
"I'm doin wht u should've done a long time ago" he's been waiting on this moment since the "I Quit" match
When Jimmy hit the second one, GAME OVER.
That just happened!!
Lmao Paul’s expressions are always hilarious 😭😂
Oh my god he kicked him twice
One of the best moments in a hot minute! I loved every second of this!
Roman need to learn to not turn his back
I knew this was going to happen
this was great finally someone standing up to roman his own family
He did what he should have been do a long time ago 0:48😂
Can’t wait for jimmy yo get bodied Friday
Wrestling's most dysfunctional family.
A tribal chief without tribe! Bloodline without family 😅😅😅
Legendary Moment Today!!🔥🐐🐐❤️🙏🙏🥇🥇💎💎👑👑
The catharsis of those superkicks.
Main Event Jimmy is the real Tribal Cheif now✊🏾
Freakin awesome!
“I got u” really hit for me 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
The usos are the ☝️
Come on now jimmy USO why would you do that to my tribal chief ☝️👑👑 like that
Roman is a bully
0:52 Music to my ears
😧😧😧😧
Roman get hit with a Steel Chair by Seth By Sami Now a Superkick by Jimmy.  Roman is Goku. Always let his guard down🤣🤣
See... Without the help of bloodline Roman is just a loser 😂 cant even win a match.
Jimmys acting is top tier, that crazy look in his eyes, incredible, certified instant classic
Holy smoke 😂
Thank you HHH for being a great storyteller inside and outside the ring.
certified hood classic 🔥
The second kick gave me goosebumps!!!
Himmy Uso
Show Stealer
i was so shocked that Jimmy attacked Roman i was like oh snap Jimmy what have you done
Omg ❤❤❤
Jay was going to attack him too. Listen carefully to what he said “you gotta do it better than that and then he was about to attack him before Jimmy pushed him away and kicked him a second time
dis is a certified roman doodoo moment
Oh... my.. God!!!
Once again a masterpiece in storytelling, and it's not even done yet, Jey turning on Roman will be even more amazing.
THE BLOODLINE IS BROKEN!!!!!!
Top 10 storylines of all time in my opinion.
Don't Care. Reigns is still champion
I no this was going to apen  😂
It's done 😢
I speak for EVERYONE when I say that final kick from Jimmy caused a rush of excitement 🤣!
That's what I've been waiting for, one of The Usos fighting back at Roman Reigns.
It feels so good Jimmy is tired of the disrespect 🔥 🔥
The look on Roman's face after his loss...was the same look on Thano's face after the finger snap by iron man...words can't describe.
The best storyline in the Modern Era.
They did it. NO way!!
Man I'm a Roman fan but that kick been a long time coming wishvit was Jey still
The usos are goats! I love their bond and i hope it's the only thing Roman will never be able to break!
This should’ve happened a long time ago
Roman's gonna finally lose when Jey kicks him
oooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmfffffffffffffffffffgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
THIS is how to do a storyline!!! I’m at the edge of my seat every time I see this story play out.
Roman gonna bring in Zilla and tell Zilla and solo to take care of USOs
Jimmy screaming in the end... Man they had to stand a lot of stuff from Roman.
The Bloodline is on history Book🙏🏼
Oh hell no the Usos are done to the ocean obscurity with the both of em ☝️🩸
That's what I'm talking about my usos ..... roman reigns deserve it
Paul Heyman is the GOAT. His facial expressions are priceless for the storyline.
The bloodline is crumbling and I love it
can almost put this on a loop and watch it over and over and over and over and over again
WOOOHOOO!!!
Jimmy unleash now put the us title on him str88
I KNEW IT!!! 😂😂😂😂 LOL!!! I knew it would happen!!! What did I tell ya?! I said before, win or lose, in this tag title main event: It was only a matter of time of who turns on who! I knew this would happen! One of the Usos turning on their Tribal Daddy!    .....but I wanted it to be Jey. 😂
FINALLY
Thank you! WWE this is good for business, the face of jey when jimmy shout out try not laugh 😂   Best ppv of the 2023
Greatest storyline ever in wwe history I can’t remember that far back so don’t quote me on that 😂
''I'm doing what u should've done a long time ago''
we love you Triple H
Omg😮
🔥🔥🔥
Cody was right usos gona leave u. Next is Solo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The uso free at last
I know that will be happening
FINALLY!!!
Well, I guess my time is up too at Wwe. See yall around the way. I'm OUT.😂
0:09  Jimmy Uso Superkick To Roman Reigns  0:52 Jimmy Uso Superkick To Roman Reigns
Words cannot describe how GRATIFYING this moment is. It was only a matter of time because it had to be done thanks to Sami. It's just what Jimmy said, he did what Jey should've done a LONG time ago and this is pretty much payback for what Roman did to him years ago.  He can enjoy his 1000 day streak all he wants but the Bloodline is cracked and the Usos is on their own! What happened today marks the beginning of Roman's downfall as champion but the beginning of Jimmy & Jey's relief from his grasp.
OMG😮
Thank god Jimmy Uso pulled the trigger. After what Roman has done to them, The Bloodline is done for!
The Best
The look on Jey's face says it all😂
This is one of the best things that has happened to WWE
Jimmy  needs a belt off that one
And then everyone who has a roman in their life smiles
That second kick and yell. So good.
I really can't wait for next week smack down 🔥🤞🤔
I love it been waiting for that but I thought Jey would be the one to do it
Hope this leads to jimmy vs roman at money in the bank
w rizz
Jimmy can't win against roman that's a fact unless he gets help from ko and Sammy
Jey was the first bloodline member to join roman he will probably be the last one to betray him
Roman and solo sikoa vs the usos at money in the bank, then again at summerslam and solo betrays roman, survivor series roman vs Seth, royal rumble not sure yet maybe aj styles, elimination chamber might have Bobby lashley and other stars, wrestlemania maybe the rock or hopefully not Cody rhoades
Roman & solo gon destroy the USO’s and jey was scared
Jimmy jus saw red.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
WHAT. JIMMY USO SUPERKICK HIS OWN COUSIN ROMAN REIGNS?????!!!!!!!!!!!
Finally jimmy uso did it that’s how it’s done he took all his emotions out super kicking Roman reigns
And that's Ladys and Gentleman is the end of The Bloodline.
Finally!!!!
Why did i had a feeling it was gonna happen at night of champions? It was about time one of the usos snapped and turned on roman reigns
This was a master piece who else saw this ...
I like everyone else saw this coming, but when it happened, I lost my mind! 😳
Damn I knew this was gonna happen  what y'all think about this?  Classic huh?
Usos Face Turn 50% Complete! Now all we need is Jey Uso to turn face next later!
This is the most sastifying face turn. Roman did a good job deserving that punishment after humiliating Sami and the Usos( especially Jey).
Jey should have done that with him
So did Roman lose any of the belts or No??... 🤔💭
Let’s Give it up for The Writers ✍️ this is Amazing Work 👏🏽 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
LA TRAICIÓN DE LOS USOS FUE LO MEJOR DE TODA LA NOCHE. .... TODO MI APOYO PARA LOS USOS..
“I’M DOING WHAT YOU SHOULD’VE DONE A LONG TIME AGO!”  After watching this, I can assure you that Roman and Jimmy are gonna start their feud. We all knew this was gonna happen and we called it.🔥🔥🔥 The biggest storyline in the modern era and it came down to this.
I swear,some of this comments are like piped in crowed noise
Jimmy  did something I will have done months of going because I will not let one of my cousins bully me and treat me like I'm a piece of trash.  Jimmy did the right thing.
Thank you thriple h your the best
We just witness the *DEATH* of The Bloodline 👀👀👀👀👀
All I got to say is it's about time
it has began!!!!
I love how they don’t try to make jimmy and hey turn on eachother but show they twin instincts
"im doing what you shouldve done a long time ago" jimmy finally snapped
10/10 five stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Heads will roll for this.😰
Excellent noir movie written by WWE and Bloodline.
The second kick was so satisfying
The Bloodline is over 😢😢
Wow... Did NOT expect Jimmy to be the one to turn on Roman! But this inner feud in the Bloodline has been a long time coming, and I cannot wait to see how it turns out!
Thank F for that
Now Roman is gonna try to divide the usos! He is gonna try to manipulate Jey by telling him Jimmy is jealous of him or something like that..Angst incoming but i believe in the usos 😩
Roman reigns awesome best good going great love
This is  a cinematic masterpiece
that's what samoan should be....
Cinema
Somebody get the Tribal Chief some milk
He did what we all want to do. Because he got us. THANKS FOR STAYING UCEY!!!
One of the reasons is Dominic will remind Roman of Sami .😊
I hope  the  uso Partner up with Ko and zammy zayne.
I'm happy Roman still have 2 titles still on his shoulders and roman didn't lose Solo did so is not roman fault I'm happy though Roman doesn't need Tag Team titles only cares about those 2 titles on his waist
This is the same one who first attacked Sami and didn't hesitate the quite ones are always the most dangerous.
Come on 😂😂🎉🎉🎉
I love Roman, but "Am I My Brothers Keeper" hats off Jimmy! There will be CONSEQUENCES!
I don't think this is the end of the Bloodline could be a start for them all to be getting face turns and they've started with Jimmy. Bloodline hasn't had a face run yet so they get turned face over a period of time. they could still get many more storylines from the bloodline
It's just crazy man
Kkkkkkk os irmãos usos atrabalharam o Roman 😂😂😂
The usos will never be split because they are the entertainment of wwe it would be a big mistake if they were Roman and the bloodline are now history solo will now be a solo fighter and can see him kicking Austen theory’s head in to will the title from him theory needs his gob closed and fast
Just when you think they couldn't do any better....
Omg this was a 10/10
I've gotta point something out here , if you notice, the other moments from NOC , the thumbnails of those moments are well defined , while the moments with Roman, in the thumbnails it's just a blurry mess
Jey uso laugh of jimmys face.
It was finally time
Months ago i read that this wasnt Sami's story but Jey's. This supports that notion more than ever.
Present 22 minutes
Any other person would’ve done that if that was their brother
About time jimmy sticks up 4 himself now jeys turn
Who does Solo side with? I can see him giving Roman a viscous   Samoan Spike but I can also see some tag matches between the two sides.
Well that was a OOOPS!!
MASSIVE W JIMMY!!
Jimi loves his brother
THIS IS THE MOMENT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR....And more to come 💯
I LIKE THAT
I'm stunned and excited
This is so sastifying. After Sami tried to convince them.
Failed bad Win
It’s about damn time!!! 👏🏼🙌🏼👏🏼🙌🏼
Easily the best PPV i have seen in a long time!
Omfg he did it😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It ain’t over. Roman will kill Jimmy. Snaps Jey out of his trance. Jey will end Roman. It started with Jey and will end with Jey.
All this needed was a barber shop window to throw Roman through.
I thought jey was gonna be the one to kick him
The bloodline is done 👍
Where's does WWE go from here, it will be hard for them to ever top a storyline this good. In todays wrestling, storylines usually can't go over a couple of months, this is going on for like 2 years and still strong.
Roman reigns need it that
I have a feeling Jey is gonna turn on Jimmy now
yall saying predictable now after the fact while yall had been talking about either jey or solo being the first to turn on roman BEFORE NOC.  now THAT was predictable.  wannabe fans predicting outcomes all wrong before a show then claiming it was "predictable" AFTER the fact.  🙄🤣EVERYTHING is predictable AFTER you seen it.
That felt sooooo good. Sorry for reign. 😮😮
por fin grandes noticias ya e la hora
Himmy USO
Finally the tribal chief has taken roman down a notch I can't wait to see Romans entire life crash and burn at summerslam
I'm reviewing this for the hundredth time. And every time it's awesome.
jimmy is the reason why roman and solo lost
Jimmy going back to his ain't nobody b**** gimmick.
LOVED IT! 😂😂😂
Will Jimmy be the next universal champion
I'm almost speechless....the double super kick to Solo ok that was an accident...but a double super kick to Roman while he's on his knees from his own cousin ?.....I can't go on anymore 😪.Great Show by the way.have a great & safe memorial weekend everyone
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
Pure Cinema
Predictable and boring
All you fans that cried about Roman winning at mania, do you see now why it was the right choice. The bloodline IS wrestling, they’re the best thing in it.
Yessss
Jimmy has officially flip out 😂wow he finally got em okay 👍👏
Betrayal 😅.
Like Jimmy said before... He's nobody's B****
I was jumping up and down off my seat as soon as Jimmy kicked Roman in the face in excitement But every knew this was going to come Sami was right it was all Roman's fault that this happened Now this has just end Sami and K.O. story with the bloodline and started a new story between usos and Roman reigns Wonder what SOLO SIKOA is going to do because he may go to usos side as brothers but maybe Roman's as the usos did super kick him This is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 (amazing and brilliant)
I’m soooooo glad Roman got kicked🤣🤣
That second kick literally broke sound barrier with crowd lmao
remember usos are the 1st ever who pinned roman in wwe main roster.
jimmy is a samoan and i heard that in samoa family is first
Reigns has brought numerous people to the table as the top guy. One of the all time great runs
This Storyline is absolutely Amazing! Jimmy did what Jey couldn't do, the Bloodline is Over and this is pure Cinema! 🔥
I'm so happy that Jimmy uso finally kicks knock the hell of Roman reigns 👊💪👍👏👏💯
😮😮
Una obra maestra
Epic Face Turn from Jimmy, that was epic. Jimmy Uso Vs Roman Reigns.  0:09 - Super Kick to Roman  0:52 - 2nd Super Kick to Roman
Finally Jimmy u did what needed to be done
When Jimmy superkicked Roman, it was so damn good I was shocked as hell.
and jimmy better return to the bloodline
The catharsis in Jimmy's scream at the end. Wow.
This is fantastic
I was a big fan of roman reins but he diseve that he keped pushing then around
When I watched the match live ,I was like WHAT THE HELLLLLLL😮😮
I Guess The Bloodline Is Over
Jimmy vs Roman for undisputed wwe universal champion
Roman had that comming to him for years now
THIS IS PEAK
Jimmy ain’t forget about Roman choking him out that get back was inevitable
What just happened why did jimmy turn on jey
So now it's jey turn to do it cause think about it Sami did it jey watch him and did nothing now Jimmy did it but jey didn't do anything so I see what wwe is doing waiting for the right moment the right time for jey to finally snap and do what he was supposed to do a long time ago or maybe I'm wrong what do you think 🤔
I started watching wrestling since this storyline begin and I'm still here at the end. THIS IS THE GREATEST AND THE BEST STORYLINE EVER. THANK YOU TO THE BLOODLINE
Epic as hell.  Roman sold that like gold.  Usos were perfect.
Bloodline's story is the best of WWE we've seen in years
jimmy better say sorry
It makes so much sense that Jimmy would be the first
Jimmy literally enjoyed hitting those superkicks on Roman lol!!!
Tribal Chief first hit by SZ chair and NOW Jimmy Uso punch and kick at Saudi Arabian! So many dramas 😂
and this, THIS is how you finish an ending
Why I thought Jey was gonna kick Jimmy's face in 😂😂😂
Oooh yeaaaah you saw it and it feels so goooood just ask jimmy
THE RIGHT THING
Yes yes yes yes
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This Is Cinema!
Jimmy better than Jey when betray roman
Jey should have pulled the trigger after
Roman Reigns New bloodline Will be with the judgment day minus Dominik Mysterio.
Yes usos and attack Román Reigns
I might go back to watching WWE after this !
finally, the great payoff.
Eren yeager: jimmy you gon let this man disrespect yo brother like that?……kick him in the face big bro
Triple Threat Match for the WWE Undisputed Universal Championship:  Jey Uso vs. Jimmy Uso vs. Roman Reigns
The end off the bloodline has begun
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Good job guys 😂😂😂
I never seen Jimmy got so angry at Roman Reigns.
What… on earth… did I just witness?…. 😧
Oh ive been waiting for that
I was not expecting for Jimmy Uso to turn on Roman. I really expecting Jey to turn. That was surprised me when Jimmy turned on Roman
HIMMY USO that’s his name
Who the main character n this story 🤷jimmy?
Here you’re here
sad but had to happen smh
Bloodline storyline is the best on the modern era of wrestling. Something that Impact or AEW can imitate but they can never one up.
At this point 0:08 became the most memorable turn in history
Finally. Jimmy and Jey can be the tag team were meant to be.
LETS GOOOOOO
The seed has been planted! Jimmy listen to Sami and the Roman Empire is going to crumble.😁
Lol the tribal trump look silly 😅😊
pense que el que iba romper con the Bloodline iba se Jei hasta solo pero jimmy? que acaba de pasar 🤯🤯
“i gotchu”❤
Wwe step it up! And jimmy is right that needed to be done on so many levels 👏 thank you jimmy ❤
Emperor Palpatine to Jimmy:The time has come Execute Order 66
I’m starting to see the trend now, first it was Sami, then Jimmy, solo will be next to turn on Roman and in the end… Jey will finally turn on Roman…
This is way more better than waaathever film in Netflix 😅😅
Jey Uso: Man I don’t give a damn what the tribal chief say.  Jimmy Uso: I am the tribal chief
Jimmy will be destroyed in next friday smack down or monday night raw by tribal chief with 1000 days celebration I’m so  Excited what will happen 🙃
All comes to the end,including the roman reigns's bloodline with the usos and solo sikoa
It looks like Jimmy Uso, can not take it anymore of his frustrations. I am happy for him. He superkick to his former Samoan Family Member Roman Reigns.  I will say this though : This Friday On SmackDown !, They're will be consequences, I guarantee it.😀👍
NOOOOOOOOO. YOU WILL REGRET THIS JIMMY USO 😠😠😥😥😥
You can tell Jimmy’s pain! he finally let it out after 2 years of suffering. It relates into a real life story with the family.
If you thought that was the most awesome babyface turn so far this year... GIVE ME A HEEELLL YEAH!!!
Why wasnt this on peacock
Jimmmy thx u
Goodbye Bloodline
That pop was something amazing🔥🔥🔥🔥 but nothing beats the pop sami got after he hit roman with a chair
0:09 0:52 Wow
Jimmy was in the shadow of his brother Jey and it's nice that WWE gave such a spot to Jimmy
This storyline keeps getting better and better Jimmy vs Roman at Money in the Bank
I can see the usos splitting up and go there own way for singles title run or something.
0:09 0:52
Calling it now. One of the Usos is beating Roman
It's Bout Damn Time Jimmy Finally Had Enough He's Leaving Thank You Lord It's A Miracle The Bloodline Is Officially Dead Finish Over!!!! Sorry Roman You're Days Is Coming To The End!!!
Yesssssss🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Yeeeeessssss Jimmy!
I did it for Jey. - Jimmy Uso
And.. Roman and the Bloodline does it again... 🍿🍿
😮‍💨
NO WAYYYYYYYY
jimmy is good a actor
Bye bye bloodline told y’all
still sad to watch
Jimmy to the rescue. Love to see it.
Jimmy said "screw this" and superkicked Roman twice. Jimmy's Nobody's B*tch gimmick is coming back.
10/10. Beautiful
Jimmy: I’m doing what you should’ve done a long time ago.
Thank you jimmy uso 🎉🎉🎉🎉
The usos have returned of the version of 2012 - 2019
Roman Reigns vs Jimmy Uso confirmed
Yeah, that's the ☝️Jimmy 🔥 🔥
What he expected  he shoves his  family  in face  im glade got actually  what he deserved  you  keep pushing  your family  and so  happy  he fin lost  what of most  make sense  storylines ever  goood for Jimmy  and real good kick to face
The bloodline is done for good this time
This moment was better than Samu Zayn and Kevin Owens title reign!
You gotta love everyone in the Bloodline
I did like how the other twin told his brother on doing what he should have done. Because back at Hell in a Cell, Roman took advantage of his compassion and used it against him that the other twin had no choice but to bow down to him. Like Sami, he is getting very tired of being mistreated.
Storytelling At The Finest I’m Just Waiting For Jay Attacks Roman
This is simply awesome Finally There is no roman reigns without the USOS
Absolute CINEMA
I'm speechless, Jimmy got guts super-kicking Roman down like that
The bloodline is always incredible! Roman Reigns continues to give us a beautiful story,thanks WWE. I stand with the bloodline. What a masterpiece
😅😂😂😂😂😂
Ohhhhhh heelllll yeaahhhhhhhhh!! Main event Jimmy
Someday please someday release a video of backstage after the match. I wanna see what they did after the match, did they hug each other or whatever. I just want to see.
And of course Roman wasn’t the one to get pinned
"You're just mad that you didn't do it first"   Now Jey is triple mad he didn't even get to be the second to do it.
Jimmy Uso tells his brother Jey Uso that he's gonna do what he should've done since Hell In A Cell 2020 and betrays Roman Reigns to eviscerate him. 0:39. 😁. In the end, Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn retain the Undisputed Tag Team Championships to defeat Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa. The Bloodline is coming down.
This is one of the greatest moments in history
Jimmy whyyyyyyy you did that 😱 omg.❤
I been said jimmy was gonna snap back n 2021
The beginning of the end of the bloodline
bloodline imploding
Very good decision Jimmy, atleast you have the guts to do right way
Hell yeaaah
Roman deserve it
PAYBACK FROM HELL IN A CELL 2020
Roman really needs to stop turning his back
Jimmy did what he had to do to roman reigns, roman  has been controlling them for ever and it has been time Jimmy couldn't let roman hit jey again so Jimmy had to super kick roman
predictable but STILLLLL FREEEEKING AWESOMEEEEE :D
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Lmfao halarious 🤣😂 way to go, Jimmy!!!
Not a chair shot to the back, but still satisfying
If only the women's division gets a storyline liked this, been saying it a while this storyline is  a masterpiece.. We just entered the end game guys..
About time
Long term story telling at its finest! The “I’m doing what you should have done a long time ago” really hit the feels
Jimmy being the big brother and snapped
Roman pushed him too far
I wonder what's going to happen with the championship celebration??
Goosebumps. I really hope it ends well for the Uso's. I kinda want them both to take those titles away from Roman, but it won't happen.
Is this the end of the Bloodline?
SmackDown is going to be very interesting…
This took time and planning, even if one thing was off the whole thing would have been for nothing. Roman seeing the Usos superkick Solo, just to get kicked himself by Jimmy who snapped from all the pressure built up, visible from the Royal Rumble 2023 post main event scene. It's just cinema!
The fact he did it twice !
To those who support Jimmy usos  super kicking roman reigns  register here
0:15 Jimmy what did you do 😨
An unhinged Jimmy Uso needs to be as good as Main Event Jey!
Jey is gonna snap and man oh man he's gonna unleash years of built up rage
Tired of his brother getting pushed around.  Usos against the Bloodline.  Main Event Jey and Day One Jimmy
Even if Jimmy was the first to super kick and brutalize Sami after his betrayal, I must say I love what he did. Hope Jey opens his eyes too.
I never wanted the bloodline to crumble. I hope you ***holes are happy.
😂😂😂😂
That was nothing short of beautiful. Hey Roman, WELCOME TO THE USO PENITENTIARY!
I jumped  so high when this happened
Fanally
I give clash of champions A+ amazing show very good storytelling
If this happen at Puerto Rico, imagine the crowd 🔥🔥🔥
This Friday gonna be crazy
Cinema
😂😂🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Hell yeah
Is good fore business
Bruh why does the thumbnail look so bad 💀💀💀
Jimmy Uso finally free from Roman Reigns brain wash control it took 3 year's for this moment & I'm so glad that Jimmy Uso did what he did
Jimmy And Sami both did what Jey should of done
F*cking finally!!! Thank you, Jimmy! The REAL Tribal Chief IS Jimmy!
That was so satisfying to see
That kick and scream by Jimmy was full of resentment and hate!!
Jimmy was right this should’ve been Jey’s moment since 2020. Best Bloodline cinema 🎦 Jimmy and Jey will be remembered for this.
The Best Storyline in the Modern Wrestling!!!
FINALLY!! let's go Jimmy.
I'm gonna cry now I DIDNT WANT THIS TO HAPPEN
Jey's character work has been STELLLLAAARRRR...... Jimmy vs Jey uso.... With Jey turning on Jimmy then Solo and Roman Vs USOS with Solo turning... Then summer slam Solo Dethrones Roman ‼️
This storyline just EXPLODED right in front of our eyes The most compelling story WWE has ever told in the modern era
For a while we thought it was gonna be Jey since he was close to Sami and maybe even Solo..but it was Jimmy the guy who appeared to be the most loyal..damn thats something
The Bloodline memebers Is about to turn rivals
I loved how Jimmy stood up for his brother saying you won't pie face him again and this is the 2nd time that Jey said why did you do that?
Merecidazo
Jimmy is right Jay should have done that 3years ago
Yessir Jimmy Finally 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Omg..its happening for real! ❤❤❤
Pls don’t split the usos up!🙏
Why sami roll out ring from he was still in the match anyway sami Kevin got the last laugh now
Honestly i expected this since last year
The Bloodline is dead and gone no more tribal chief good luck Acknowledge me Bow Down to Me .
Jimmy finally did what he should've done a while back
Roman kept pushing and pushing
Esto se va a poner feo
That scream by Jimmy😮
😔
Seeing Roman take not 1, but 2 superkicks from Jimmy was one of the most satisfying moments of my life. God I love this storyline
Forever has an end, and you will face the fate for the greater good! He deserves for making his historic title reign.
This moment was amazing
Jimmy: acknowledge this!!
This is beautiful
Boy I've just been jumping around my room like a kid watching this video alone. I can only imagine being in the crowd and reacting live. I LOVE THIS STORYLINE 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thanks to the USO
About time Reigns got what he deserves . Jimmy doing that was priceless . Reigns empire is crumbling .
Im doing what you should've done a long time ago
The Bloodline is crumbling to the ground...
FINALLY!!
Oh my god I knew it .
Roman's "Reign" is coming to an end. 😁
Is this really surprising come in it’s wwe anything is possible plus Sami zayn has been telling them for months that they are just being used and Kevin owens said it too
I KNEW IT!! I KNEW IT!!  I KNEW THIS WAS HAPPENING!!!
BYE BYE Bloodline Stupid Jimmy
So happy 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
* I'M DOIN YOU SHOULD'VE DONE A LONG TIME AGO... *  I Believe that was 3 years Ago , when he got injured before came back ...  Even though I don't like THE USOS.. But Jimmy Has Finally gets Berserk 😡.. it's not just Jimmy wants to Rematch Against Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn because he knows that he could beat them..IT BECAUSE OF ROMAN REIGNS AND PAUL HEYMAN DIDN'T TREAT ANYTHING EXCEPT ONLY TRIBAL CHIEF   and NOW HIS FINALLY UNLEASHED 😡🔥🔥🔥.. HELL....HE COULDN'T FORGET THAT " PART TIMER" ROMAN REIGNS BY GUILLOTINE CHOKE BEFORE JEY USO SAID ' I QUIT ' ...  JIMMY USO GOT SUPERKICK BY NOT ONCE ..BUT FREAKING TWICE ON ROMAN REIGNS TO HIS FACE...  I ACKNOWLEDGE YOU JIMMY USO.. YOU FINALLY KNOW UNDERSTAND AND I UNDERSTAND THAT HOW YOU FEEL
Jimmy uso did Great job 👏 ❤😊
Jimmy is gonna be the NEW HEAD OF THE TABLE
Pauls face 😂😂😂
Jimmy USO Is A BabyFace Once Again Damn First Sami Turn On The Bloodline Now Jimmy Damn 2023 Is A Hell Of A RollerCoster Ride🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nobody touch my twin like that 😅😅
Thrilling!!! Stories like this in Wrestling pay off & feel even more satisfying when millions of fans lost their minds over that one moment 😌🙏🏽💯
ABOUT DAMN TIME
I have waited so long for this moment
The “I got you” words should become merch
Wow!😮
Even though the whole storyline was somewhat predictable it was executed to perfection and is great long term storytelling
This was the wrestling version of Vader throwing The Emperor to his death
2021 Jimmy I aint nobodies B 2023 Jimmy   told you I was nobodies B but seriously everyone knows the face mush you only get one of those you do that twice what happens nextbis your fault and plus Pauls expression 😅
Up there with Sami hitting Roman with the chair at The Royal Rumble this was another incredible moment that was picture perfect bring on Roman & Solo Vs The Usos.
I felt that yell from Jimmy 😌
Anybody notice paul heyman crying😂😂😂😂
Roman Reigns new bloodline will be Solo Paul and the judgment day
we all want to see Usos VS Roman & Solo at SummerSlam
Yooooooo WWE lit rn ngl
Bloodline, run the wwe.
Tbh Roman kinda deserved that for all the times he bullied and manipulated the usos. If I was jimmy I would’ve did the same thing.
It has happened 😮
FINALLY! Roman got a taste of his own medicine, great job Jimmy!❤
nice knowing you jimmy
Jimmy- I'm doing what you should've done a long time ago. Shades of when Jimmy tried to get Jey to leave roman before the whole bloodline thing.
It's gonna be roman vs jimmy at money in the bank
This is totally amazing!
Sami was pals with Jimmy, but it was Jey who stepped up for him and we all thought Jey will eventually turn on Roman but it’s Jimmy at the end. This is CINEMA!
Jimmys eyes tho.
very entertaining;
This is the fault of Roman
What a shocking moment 😱🥶🔥
Yesssssssss I been waiting for thiss
Hell yeahhhh
This is one of the best wrestling stories in thousands of years.
Roman should.of won the belts smh.     Sami and ko suck
The Greatest Storyline in WWE History
Jimmy uso did the right thing
Jimmy turning on Roman was so satisfying, a long time coming. Can't wait for Smackdown next week.
Jimmy USO is awesome you have balls thanks wwe.
Yo Will there be full match night of champions today?? Pls someone answer

DEYM 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
“I’m doing what you have done a long time ago” Jimmy Uso. This betrayal was epic 🔥🔥🔥
it's over! the bloodline's era on top has come to an end
So many people keep saying “lol the bloodline was the best thing to happen to tv, have fun watching mid every week” like that was gonna happen either way with Triple H pushing the younger talent lmao 😂
About time yesssssss
YESSS
Jimmy uso A Goat For Doing That He knew What was happening 🔥🔥🔥
Love to see it!
First they will do Jimmy vs Roman at Money in the Bank for the titles and than they will do the Usos vs Solo and Roman Regins at SummerSlam in a tag match
Go Jimmy 😂 finally
Daammmm....The bloodline is over!!!
We Are Slowly Seeing The End Of The Bloodline
Too bad it was scripted. Put that lazy part timer in his place
They messed up the angle though
It's finally happening! the crumble of the Bloodline! (I've been waiting to see how they'd pull it off, I'm no hater)
brrooooooooooooooooooooooo
He should've kicked Jey 😔
Main event jimmy is finally happening i guess
So just repeating what they did with Jey
The Beginning of the End.
The "kick" heard around the world. 💥
This ain’t wrestling this is CINEMA at the highest level! Love this Damn storyline
Finally they actually do it. They’ve been teasing that for so long.
I am speechless right now
Me and my dad went crazy when this happened, also when solo got super kicked also 😂
Hell yeah Jimmy about freaking time aw this was so great Jimmy telling Jey I always been there for you we can only count on us  I can't wait for Friday bruh + the match ,the ending 10/10 for me.
Himmy uso ☝🏻☝🏻
Best storyline in WWE
Never was a fan of bianca, bloodline, and cody but this event overall is probably the best I've seen. Every single match is 10/10
0:09 0:52
Unbelievable!  Which side is Jey on though?
No
And just like that, the bloodline is no more
Wwe hood classic
Acknowledge the new tribal chief!

Jesus Christ!  How does the bloodline get back on its feet?
The bloodline is now falling
I AM SO HAPPY!!!!! Finally!!!! Jimmy did what needed to be done
0:42 Paul Heyman's Face like Crying 🤣
Welcome to BLOODLINE: Civil War
That kick to solo means War 🤣😂😂🤣🤣
I can't even describe the adrenaline rush I got when Jimmy kicked Roman. This was absolutely amazing.
FINALLY IM SO HAPPY CUZ I BEEN WAITING FOR THID
ITS JIMMYS TURN TO SHINE!!!!!!!
Jey isn't mad at Jimmy for superkicking Roman. He's just mad that he didn't get to do it first.
YES! YES! YES! YES!
Now is the time WWE to turn Roman into a face he's been a heel for a bit and he did a good job with it.
Wow just wow
2015: Seth Rollins attacked Roman Reigns and destroyed The Shield 2023: Jimmy Uso attacked Roman Reigns and destroyed The Bloodline
crowd reaction was intense
That'll do, Jimmy. That'll do.
This is one of the best things that could’ve happened to the uso ever
Yesir finally
YESSS When I was watching this I screamed so loud and I am in public so it was kinda weird 😂😂😂 BTW W SAMI

Bout damn time!
It feels soo goood to see finally Roman getting a kick in the face from Jimmy, now hoping that the Uso’ s get together and fight against Roman and Solo.
I COULDNT BELIEVE MY EYES funny thing I had to watch it again to make sure it was real
Man, this was done so beautifully props to Solo, Jey, Jimmy and Roman Reigns for this storyline i look forward to seeing SmackDown now things are about to get wild
The Bloodline is CLEARLY divided.
Jimmy Uso did what Jey Should've done a long time ago
Yes my man jimmy
It was long overdue
Absolutely the Usos finally see the light
Thank You Jimmy USO
Finally the beginning of the end for Roman reigns and his championship Fr 🔥💨🧸
At frickin last The Usos are done with Roman!
Jimmy Uso: I AIN'T NOBODY'S (BLEEP)!!
HELL YEAH BABY

This makes the ending to Wrestlemania worth it… Cody’s time will come
Good god ALL might.
He deserves that
Epic

What a twist this was Epic
Reigns and Solo vs The Usos at Money in the Bank confirmed.
The End Of Bloodline !!!
I get it why jimmy did it
Do it
WWE MASTERPIECE! This is Jimmy time!  The Bloodline is DEAD!
😂i knew that was gon' happen😂
And like i said before the bloodline is over....
C'est bon pour lui
I'm sorry, but this should've been in front of an American crowd
YESSS!!! I KNEW JIMMY CAN COUNT ON IT
This is Cinema storytelling since the very beginning of this group in 2020
The bloodline will go down as the greatest story ever told in WWE
FINALLY
DAMN!
Jimmy Uso is arguably the more charismatic one of The Usos  He could totally work as an individual babyface
LETSSS GOOOOOOO
So Sami and ko won?
"You're (Jey) not mad that I hit Roman Reigns with that steel chair; you're just mad that you didn't get to do it first." Sami Zayn March 17, 2023
JIMMY did exactly what he should have done a long time ago👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽
Jimmy!☝☝
Everyone saw this coming from 2 weeks ago but for the bloodline to end this way is perfect
Yesss
This is cinema.
I'll say it again. The Bloodline storyline has been the Best storyline in WWE History! 🔥🔥
WOOOOOOOOWWWWWW!!!!
YES! YES! A THOUSAND TIMES YES!
The Bloodline is history💔💔
Turn face
First
Yeeeeessssssssssssss Let’s go
The S.H.I.E.L.D
Jey is back in the same spot that he was in from The Royal Rumble 🤣
Waited for a night of champions so long so I could see Roman reigns the undisputed tag team champions with solo but no😭😭
OH MY GOD!😲 Jimmy Uso just stabbed Roman Reigns in the back! And I assumed the Bloodline is no more!
I knew Jimmy was gonna turn on Roman
Jimmy uso superkick a Roman Reigns 😱😱😱
An iconic moment. It was time for Jimmy to break free of Reigns' manipulation. Main event Jimmy soon
ROMAN REIGNS IS MAD LOL
the bloodline is over now 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
It's about time this happened
and still the undisputed tag team champions Kevin owes and same zan
Jimmy shouting at jey “IM DOIN WHAT YOU SHOULDVE DONE A LONG TIME AGO…I GOTCHU” just proves this is the best story WWE has told since Bryan’s run 2014. Usos 100% deserve a singles push if they were to ever break up.
Well Jimmy's out of the bloodline now
The bloodline is imploding!
These two have come along way from the face paint. I love this story !
Jimmy vss Roman in mitb then do Roman vs Cody at Summerslam with Jey costing Roman the titles
Right now Jimmy's like 'FINALLY'
Good now Roman has to lose the belts
0:09 What the Hell!!!!! Jimmy Uso superkick Roman Reigns? Why?
The Bloodline has officially crumbled
Introducing Jimmy Uso, Future Money in The Bank Champion
Jimmy snapped dem eyes tho!!!
wwe because they do that wwe is no longer the same wwe ruins everything good and makes the bad big
Finally what a show
Finally The end of bloodline. Thanks Jimmy.
I can’t believe but I saw it coming I don’t even know what to say
Well roman kind of deserved it this time not gonna lie i cant believe i liked such a diabolical bully 🤦‍♂️ 😡 zinger 🖕🏼 burger😂
How about that Tribal Chief  Gonna Cry 😂
Ngl i think people are going overboard with praising the story.  It feels like massive recency bias. The story hass been pretty good as of late but a lot of it sucked before sami joined.  The story overall is pretty good but to say it's the best is really pushing it.
Finally
1st
Finally
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
First
You should be a shamed of your self jimmy 😢
💔💔💔
Early
About damn time.  You can only disrespect the Ones so much
Acknowledge Jimmy!!☝️☝️
Acknowledge Jimmy uso everyone
It's Jimmy's time! All that's left is for Jey to get on the same page. Shades of Royal Rumble tho when Jey said "What are you doing?"
I clicked faster than EDP replying to a 13 year old
The Fall of the Bloodline 👀
YES|
The trigger was finally pulled.
This is cinema
Finally, that pop was loud af!
I KNEW IT 😂
Another Betrayal to Roman
