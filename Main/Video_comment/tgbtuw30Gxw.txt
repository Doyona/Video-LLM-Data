Bright, High Mids, Bite, Cut... whatever you want to call it...  is your friend in a Band.   Ignore the internet Yanks and their assertion of warm and wooly tone.   Clear Pick Attack is what you need.
Katana Gen1 50w.... issue... the Speaker just could not handle the volume.... it was really mid biased, nasal, box-y, and the speaker would distort before the amp was even trotting.    I hope Boss have improved things on the 50w Gen3.    I see hundreds of Katana Mk1 50w for sale on Guntree.  Rarely see a 100w 1x12. As for Mk1 100w 2x12.... I think I'm the only guy in Australia who ever bought one, never see them on Gumtree.
To anyone who cares.... I bought a Katana Mk1 100w 2x12 when they first came out.  I still have it. It's done 100's of rehearsals and gigs...  and is my #1 when I just cannot be bothered faffing around with either my Vox AC30 or Fender Blues Deluxe.   It works. I use it only as an Amp, not the effects, I have a good pedal board.   I've been looking at the Gen3 100w 2x12, only for the sake of it's "new speaker design"....  I have alnicos in my AC30 and Blues Deluxe...  hard to beat them for that Stratty or Tele Chime.   But if the GEN3 can get there... I may well upgrade.  Only watched videos so far... nearest Shop is 180 miles away (Livin the fly-ridden dream of the Australian out-back).
I have to say that was so funny to watch my wife’s snoring and I have the phones on in bed at 76 nearly pissing myself at the humour and the understanding between you both 🎉but really I’m desperate to get a guitar & amp with jazzy clean sounds help
Replace chorus with berringer and budget sorted
i am playing a gretsch g2101 ive swapped the stock pickup with a lolar p90 dogear pickup im plugged into a caitlinbread epoch ep3 boost plugged into a supro 1970rk keely custom with a ibanez ad9 in the effects loop for slapback delay i have the amp plugged into a extension cab that is a epiphone valve jr 1x12 that i had the stock speaker swapped with a 8 ohn celestion 12" vintage u.k. 30 . give me some pointers can you similaye it?
Wow! Absolutely wonderful! Thanks yet again. Wonderful experiment. Explore improvise to your heart's content
Kraze videos
Great advert for the store. Smart. This was interesting.
Danish Pete snd Lee are my favorite YouTube duo
Katana sounds way better 👍
Artist guitars are great value.  Shame it's not possible to have them in shops at a similar price.  Oh and Positive Grid
Long & McQuade here in Canada has or had the purple classic Vibe teles a few years back and may still
"You were once a bigshot player living the rock'n'roll dream, and now you're stuck here making commercials with me." 🤣😂 DAMN Captain, that's cold-hearted.
Pete's been thinking about this insurance job all day, seems a bit fishy to me!
You should do this with the compromise of buying everything at the end
Staff member showcases some gear that hasn't sold as well as anticipated.
Surprised you did not take a mini TS, but the king is a good idea ! Perfect daily training rig also. Love it !
I bought a Bugera v22 but I hated it. The sound was too harsh. I even put a Fender cone in it which improved it slightly. After deliberating for some time and I opted for the Blackstar Silverline special 50. Much better than the Katana (which is good) but not quite as sweet sounding. Probably because it has the Celestion G12 v type cone. Why did Blackstar stop producing the Silverline? Shot themselves in the foot.
That was a little Tom Jones intro there at the end, huh?
Man… that Custom Shop sounds thin. I mean I know that’s Pete’s favorite sound, but it’s just an observation. Crazy.
Squire sounds better
I think this kind of video would have been way better in the older ‘browsing the shop’ Andertons style. Whoever is the unlucky touring musician, I want to see them try a few amps and ‘hear’ what they hear as they play and explain. You wouldn’t have to stay in the shop for the whole thing, set the gear up in the video room like when you’re doing pedal shootouts, let them play and make up their mind, switching back and forth. Looking for new gear on the internet is fun and everything, but being in a guitar shop cash-in-pocket ready to spend is the best.
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!    THIS WAS AWESOME!!!!    I WAS FLOORED, WHEN YOU SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THE "BUGERA V-22",... WHICH I JUST BOUGHT ONE, A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO!!!   I REALLY DO LIKE IT, TOO!!...
Used blues jr + used player strat
I would go with the ToneX pedal, a 50 watt katana with foot controller and boss expression pedal for wah etc and  a FGN T style J Standard
I tried that Katana in a store.. I found it to be very cheap and plastic feeling right down from the control knobs to the cab.. It sounds very processed which could be that it tries to do so much but only really achieves them in part.. It is ok for the bedroom rock star or the budget player which of course this video is about....
@5:55 if Pete slapped the violin rosin outta Lee's mouth, I wouldn't have been surprised...
You guys must have some Sweet deal with Katana. Because I have tried/purchased them in 3 versions now and they are shit. I don’t get all the hype. I would take ANY tube amp over the Katana and the that Infinium 22 is a hell of an amp. I hate the 5 watt version and loved it. Lost lots of respect on this one.
I’d do a kemper premium player, and a 400 pound guitar
Gonna send in my c.v so O can avail of the 7 pound staff discount on every grand spent😂❤
a live rig under 1k.... I would legit get a modeling unit for half and spend the other half on a guitar. Modeling has gotten real good nowadays.
I keep coming back to these episodes for the vibes. Oz is so underrated as an audience member and commentator.
Gotta appreciate the effort. It must take some time to set up all of those mics and stuff even if they're most likely pre-wired and ready to go offscreen somewhere.
Sooooo funny that a year/18 months ago Andertons remembered the Bugera Infinium line all because Lee went on a holiday… I bet Bugera have been churning them out since!
Was this filmed in 60fps by any chance? Or is my phone breaking. Looks sooo weird.
Every time Lee says “interestingly” I hear “interesting Lee” 🤣
“No talking now Pete.”  The best thing Lee had ever said.
The “I get to pay my own petrol comment” hits hard 😂 13:34
Bugera sounds so much better than the Katana. Only a beginner would care about the thousand digital fxs from the Katana.
1:30 EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
Where is danish Pete from? Germany?
How much is tax in England,?
Can a britt please tell me the difference between pound and quid?
But does it go to 11? 🤔
Through shitty iPhone speakers, the Boss sounds like it’s playing a recording of what’s being played. If that makes any sense. 😂
neck pickup on petes tele comes through with like more overtones and fullness for sure.
❤
Danish Pete, Im buying  Mesa Boogie amp today. Whats your word on how the perform? Im not sure about the model but its a head and perfect shape for $600 (contingent sale) I value your opinion. If I dont like it I'll be looking for you. (Just kidding of course)
I would just have gotten a multi FX unit, a Sire T7 and a Katana 50 since you're not playing an arena and don't really need mega amplification...just sayin'.
The Behringer Hell Babe is underrated!
I would go with playable Tele and a UADFX Dream today as my rig. In fact, I did exactly that.
Interesting to look at prices a year on and see that the Bugera seems to be holding its price rock steady.
Burgera just blows the katana away.
Just saw Pete's Westlife Solo. Damn. He is probably to good for Youtube Guitar Videos. :)
If you don't like Danish Pete, you have no soul.
Lot of allergies there, plenty of sniffles.
Similar ... but as soon as he switched to the Katana I preferred it !
Andertons has the benefit of having some the clone and far east pedals for sale in EU vs us in the US. Sweetwater does not have the lower budget pedals besides Behringer. Still made mine under 1k using Sweetwater's offerings.
I actually preferred the sound of the Katana
Mine would be:  Guitar: Squire Affinity Telecaster Black Amp: Katana 100 MK II Pedals: TC Electronic Polytune 3 Noir; Behringer CL-9; Boss BD-2; Behringer HD-300; Behringer UM-300; TC Electronic Flashback 2; Behringer UC-200.  This all assumes Andertons would donate a PSU, patch cables and 2 guitar leads.
Lee laying in Pete’s ear what to like and what to choose 😂😂😂
Isn’t danish pete the coolest guy?!! Love these videos! Plus I learn all these British sayings! Butter on my biscuit?
All these band under a grand, and rig under a grand should be shifted to 1500 i think with the enormous inflation we saw in the last few years.
great vid, fun to watch, best from brooklyn  from romford
Cap can’t keep his hate for solid state in
$1000 to play a gig. There I said it under 10 sec
A Fender  Super Champ X2 would be a great choice.
Really enjoyed that. Pete acted as if he was seriously picking the rig with only a few hours to go before the gig! Magic stuff!!
Waiting for someone to throw a wrench in and get a modeler instead of an amp. Blow the minds
Nice to hear a shoutout for my trusty Bugera V22. Can confirm it does well with teles.
I definitely like the Bugera better. The Katana just sounds a little muffled to my ears
What if it goes out of tune? Lol
That katana sounds amazing! So open and articulate.
i miss when you guys would walk around the shop and pick out stuff!!! being a poor Ameriburger those were the only chances I could see what the store is like! but who the hell knows, maybe I can make it over the pond to Andertons before the collapse of society around 2030 or so. couple years left to make a move lol
That Valeton wah reminded me of John Frusciante, who uses an old Ibanez wah.
I think the Squire one now needs to be needs to be modified to the inch of its life, like Please, brownie strat I think that will be a good video to do based off the purple one, the original one
Pete can actually spend about 1,020.00 because he has my 20.00 for a "Let's Start at 12 "tee shirt I ordered months ago that he's never sent to me. The email at his "store" keeps bouncing back to me as an invalid address so I'm at a dead end. I wrote to Anderton's, they said (on my second note to them) that they would help me sort this out but since then absolutely nothing. No response, no update, no tee shirt, nothing. I figure that since I'm all the way over here in America they know there's nothing I can do. Maybe he'll use my 20.00 to buy new strings for this rig's guitar.
If the accident happened in front of the store, why is he buying through the online store?
That V22 is one of the best affordable valve amps out there. I've owned one, and turned up power amp wise, it's really good for the Imperial credit of the realm. Takes delay and reverb really well in the FX loop, and put a Tubescreamer in the front, and it speaks.
at 26:46 when he plays "the chord" and that familiar goosebumps moment happens when the tone is just nailed.
That Bugera kicks butt…
I disagree with the premise of this video! The Purple Tele cannot be destroyed. That’s just impossible nonsense. I just won’t believe it! 😅😂
The spanish inquisition does not work that way, it only comes when you least expect it!
Pete is clearly a player who has had his share of technical difficulties at gigs
would love to see a bassist do this. just because the amp is going to become such a large part of the budget that it may pose some interesting questions.
embarassing to turn up with a squire???
The Squier just sounds amazing.
I would not get the Squire. I have one. I had it set up by a great Luthier and all that. Thing doesn't stay in tune for one minute. Grab a Sire if possible
Great video! And amazing to hear Petes ideas on putting together a rig FAST and why he differs from other approaches.. also somehow expecting Pete to play Delilah.. but the video was made before the "scandal" so it shoukln't matter....
PRS Silver Sky and Yamaha THR10 II would be my go to for under £1,000, and you still walk away with £100!
I think that when buying a Fender guitar, the Player series is the line where anything more expensive than that doesn't mean better in terms of sound. It's more like a matter of taste after that imo.
If you can't find a quality guitar, amp and some pedals for under the equivalent of $2000 Australian dollars, you don't deserve to be playing guitar...
I wouldn't struggle with one pickup. When most of the guitars come with 2 or 3 pups.
The Squier sounded best, but very close.
how did Danish Pete drive off in his write off car that had been hit in the accident?? LOL!
"KILL HIM!!!"  😂😂😂
I would just get the Bugera and the King of blues and forget about it.
Katana all day long.
Damn the Cardigans - been trying to think of that band names for weeks now. Cheers! Good Olé Days!
One could likely dial the Katana in to sound more like the Bughera than what you’re hearing here. Obviously not the same, no tubes. But you could get a more similar EQ curve with a bit of effort. Katana tends to be a bit more “hi-fi” like a studio monitor or keyboard amp almost, less like a classic guitar amp. Katana is kinda made for using with a bunch of pedals for tone shaping. If you want more of a classic amp sound, throw a Celestion in the Katana. (Theres an Andertons video about that right?) Depends on what kind of music you’re doing. Blues or classic rock, go for the Bughera.
“We digress” and “No talking Pete”  The Captain valiantly trying to rescue the other 34 and a half minutes.
Hell of a rig for 1000 quid.
I have the Bugera V5 , put in an 8 inch Eminence 820H speaker and Genalex Gold Lion tubes . AMAZING ! I bet you can drop a 12 inch Eminence Swamp Thang in that Bugera V22 and some Genalex Tubes and that amp will really come ALIVE !
Do this in the store please.
I wish he would have chosen the Catalyst over the Katana,  I've heard both and was amazed of the tones the Catalyst was delivering.
Thanks for the fun video. I found the Kat’s built-in pedal sounded better than the external Dirt pedals I tried.
1:35 any boss pedals will be completely oblivious to the car crash.
Someone should look into why all of these accidents happen right outside of Anderton's ... just a thought 🤔😝
No tuner?
Pete, those shoes are proper. Love them. Proper shout.
This was cool, great fun!
Wow the Capt tried hard to steer Pete away from a t style guitar. Let the man make his choices
The digital number display, upper right corner.  Is that a tuner display?  My local shop had one like that forever ago - disappeared X years ago not sure why.  I CAN NOT find one on the internet.  “Room tuner” “Large display tuner” why can’t I find anything?  I want an always on, read it across the room tuner.  It doesn’t have to be the most accurate thing in the world - I get there’s limitations.  It just needs to be better than my $hitty ears!  Help!
It would have been a travesty if Pete couldn’t identify the sound of his expensive guitar he soul bonded to against those cheap ones hahah. Phew
It would have been a travesty if Pete couldn’t identify the sound of his expensive guitar he soul bonded to against those cheap ones hahah. Phew
I have literally stopped the video at the hint of a solid-state amp.   Not interested  in going any further.   I watched the rest anyway and there's great stuff there. Let's just decide that 2023 is a year of prosperity and stop doing the 1000. rigs.  You've dove it to death.  Let's have some moderately priced rigs 2 or 3k  and what is the most amazing rig you can make up?   I'm interested in that.
What about the power supply for the pedals? Only a brief mention that it existed. Please talk about those too. They are so needed with overdrive pedals. They aren’t cheap either.  Can’t see Pete going on stage without one.
I got the artist katana 100 with the upgraded waza speaker last year and it is so nice. I swear I'll never go back to valve. Only exception is if I get rich and famous but there's really nothing better south of $1000
That Katana sounded a bit meh, I was wondering if I made the right choice going Marshall DSL rather than Katana, glad I chose the Marshall now!
You picked the wrong Katana. The Artist was made for this.
Pete's reaction when T' Captain suggests he might want to go for something OTHER than T-Style!!! LOL!!
Just get the guitar and the HX stomp. Use the rest of the money for the after party 😅
ME:Just get a Fender Tele (or strat) and a Helix.         Done next video
I came here to listen to danish pete play ….
You have something in stock? Wow
I'm going to have to disagree with Pete; the Katana sounds better than the Bugera to me. But that's just a matter of taste. The pedals sound awesome. There's a reason my bank manager keeps calling me about payments to "Andertons". (And I love "I almost just need a G chord", and Pete just goes to an E. 🤣 Attitude: right there.)
i rememeber danish pete as the mesa boogie rep and he had a waxed moustasche. or maybe it was all a dream....
I'd be interested to have Pete's option on my 1974telecaster which is slightly modified, with a brass mighty mite six saddle bridge ( ala Keef Richards) and a overwound Kent Armstrong bridge pickup.
Cool video! but, if he was on his way to the gig he would have to go through the store to find the equipment, not order online and wait several days for delivery.. I know its simpler to use an ipad or whatever, but its more fun when you guys film inside the store. Just mention in the video that we can get it all on your website..
Quilter SB US to the house. Done
you should do one of these videos with dave simpson
The bugera v22 seems a great value for money combo. Even if Pete seemed reluctant to say it was much sounding 😂. But to think you can create a rig for that price. When I’ve spent literally thousands over the pst few year. Definitely considering a bugera for the studio. For the youngsters who don’t have a valve amp this is a great place for them to start. Might even be able sell a few for you!!
I would 100% go direct, simplifier Dlx or something.
The Katana just can't compare to the V22. Great to have Pete and the Capt. so much better than former times.
The Katana 50 doesn't have effects loop. That's why you want the Katana 100 if you have effects pedal.
Katawna is SO bad. I got one and can’t play it.
Now I want a purple tele.  Gotta stop watching these videos...
i remember danish pete as a mega boosi salesman when he had a 1970 pron stache
I would use that 1000 pounds to walk to the nearest bar and drink away the sorrow of having lost that purple Tele 🤣
My go :  - Pacifica 112J - Valeton GP200 - HeadRush FRFR112
Why does the style of this video remind me of a Faulty Towers episode…
id buy a sire guitar and a line 6 modeling kinda amp
Way to nail it Pete!  You da man!
Can we get a Pete’s licks video!
For me, I'd go with the Squier Paranormal Toronado for 315, the Roland Blues Cube Stage 60 for 619, and a tc electronic Spark booster for 59, and use the built-in reverb in the amp. Grand total 993 GBP at today's prices on Andertons. I guess I'd borrow a tuner from someone at the gig.
What?  Danish Pete can't get an EPIC DEAL??????
Nice to see that Pete can find a purple Tele for a very reasonable price that he liked playing. And it seems like the katana would have the Effects he was looking for other than maybe the wah pedal or something like that.  But now that I think about it, I guess the scenario was structured in a way that required that he get some pedals so Andertons could feature some pedals 😂.
What a great rig for just over 1k! It's a great time to be a guitarist.
I bought a hellbabe.  worst musical purchase I ever made.
How about modelling amps? there are some really good ones out there
why not use the catalyst 100 on this.. Clean headroom,, two programmable channels...
I own a few ultra high end clean amps but I have been using the mk1 katana head into a milkman 2x12 cab. Thing sounds amazing. Throw in a Klon and it’s a perfect setup
Rock bugera, hardrock/metal katana
Wait ....how he can get back to the car when his back is crashed ???? LOL
I would’ve gone for the dream 65 instead the amps pete used
"i'm a low to high kinda guy" that hit home for me :D
"It puts it in the basket" is my favourite bit from this video 😂
Guys shopping in the store is the best part about these videos.
Tbh, not enjoying this format, yes we know you have an amazing website (which I use alot) but I miss the walking through the store and picking and trying the instrument.
At this point I don’t even pay attention to the video’s concept or objective, I just watch Pete’s playing to steal all the tricks haha!!! Love your playing Pete, keep rocking 🤘
When’s the Captain’s £1,000 rig?
For the gain bits, the Bugera was way better than the Katana!
It seems to really upset the Captain when people don't go down the humbucker/blues route. Like he doesn't recognise other forms of music exist.
Same tele but with a Mustang GTX100. Save yourself 132 pounds.
I learned so much about pedals. (Deep bow).
Katana 50, all day
Great work guys. Thank you. I would like to hear a comparison of the fender gtx series to the models they are reproducing. Again, outstanding channel guys!
Can you come & play for my birthday Pete? Pretty purpke please?? 😂
Question- which Katana variant are you using on the clean? I prefer it 'ON' which I think is closer to a VOX as it has more middle, and takes pedals very well. But I'm using the head with a custom 1x12 Vintage 30 cab.
Let's face it. That Squier is an unofficial Danish Pete Sig model. Nobody was doing purple until recently except him.
That Behringer wah sounded aces.
A lot of people don't realize that Danish Pete was in that one band that had that song. The one that went bombedumm dum dum bedumm.
can we ban people guests going for the Boss Katana, in fact ban them from using modelling amps
I'm just focused on Pete's shoes. I was looking at exactly the same ones on the Nike website the other day. They look great. Going to have to get them.   Also, I think the Bugera sounds way better than the Boss. It's unfortunate, since I wanted to like the Boss because of it's versatility. I would love to get one if it's a good recording platform. It just sounds a bit too digital for my tastes though.
Who thought the custom shop Tele sounded the worst
These type of videos always end-up with a Squier and a Boss Katana. No real surprises. It would have been fun to see someone pick a Yamaha revstar element or an Ibanez Az essentials for a change.
Man that bugera was amazing
Dear people who can speak fluent English. It’s not the same as speaking idiomatically. Being fluent is not the same as being able to speak like a native. I am done.
I'm not the biggest fan of the price point anymore it seems like the amp is always the two same amps for these videos. I think these days you should raise it to 1400 to 1500 quid. I think that's proper for a really good rig instead of these damn bedroom rigs. Cut a couple more lawns and make some more money for something proper
When Pete said he thought the Katana was going to be better, I laughed. I went from a Katana to that very same Bugera, and there's no way that wasn't coming out ahead. It's not my main amp, but it sounds great so I blend it with a DSL. I get just about any tone on the planet with just a few pedals. I loved the Katana when I had it, but after A/B'ing it with the Bugera it was no contest. Just like this video.
man i thought that sire sounded killer. i’d choose that over the CV any day.
Anytime I am trying to build a rig on a small budget, I always just go straight to the Mustang GTX or the Katana with an HSS Squier Strat, and a Boss GT-1. So it’s great to see some other combinations that are interesting.
Danish Pete is awesome. Sold me on one of those cheap Valeton EP-1 Surge wah pedals for my small board. Just what it needs. Only $58 on Amazon right now. Thanks, Pete
so how about a blinfold guitar test but then swap the pickups?
Sounds like the katana was in the acoustic mode
Why do you guys not physically go round the store anymore? That was much more fun than watching you looking at an iPad...
I would never do that, if you only have that money to spend and you want to invest your time in the guitar and music, for sure you are poor and do not have much money to invest cause you have other bills to pay and food to put on the table. I instead would do this: Line 6 Hx stomp (Live and Record) (599 Euros); Harley Benton G112 Celestion V30 (169 Euros) (You can upgrade with another to do stereo in the future); Harley Benton Custom Line Thunder 99 (99 Euros); Harley Benton ST-20HH Active SBK Bundle (158 Euros); 2x Harley Benton FPC-10 Flat Patch Cable (2,90 Euros each), Harley Benton SpaceShip 40 (55 Euros) Boss BIC-5 Cable (20,30 Euros). Total in Thomann store=1106,1 Euros (With new prices given the inflaction cause one year ago everything was cheaper). I think you can't go wrong with this, you have everything and can upgrade the guitar and try stereo with another 1x12 cab without spending much money in upgrading in the future. PS: You can invest in a experession pedal and control HX Stomp expression effects too. At this date and hour £1000=1145,73 Euros, soooo, with the rest of the money you can grab some IR's and record like a pro or use the cab sim on HX Stomp and instead invest in a DAW of your choise that meets your budget and/or upgrade your patch cables for the pedalboard conections. I assume you have a audio monitor or headphones, if not i would trade the Harley Benton Custom Line Thunder 99 for a monitor or headphones, and in the future when you go for stereo you can upgrade with the HB Thunder 99 you ditched and buy another 1x12 HB V30 Cab and a cable. You can always ask a friend for a guitar when recording or try in your local store a deal.
Bravo Lee, the is retailer genius. Happy Holidays to you and the Andertons family
Choosing a Squier FSR Classic Vibe Thinline Telecaster for £299 (astonishing value for money) would have freed up an extra £70 for the amp / pedals...
Loved this. Rare to get such a concentrated wadge of Pete wisdom.
From the way he zeroed in on what he wanted and the thought-out reasoning behind it, one gets the feeling that Pete has done something like this before and has some experience with just this scenario.
Katana has more than one delay...
Bite your tongue about the purple tele and running up the boot
I happen to have the same Bugera and CV purple Tele from Andertons.
I dont know what or how the english pound system works but when you start with 1000 and then deduct guitar price 369 you dont get to 641 in the USA please add subtitles for the two countries separated by a common language  In UK 100 miles is a long way and in the US 100 years is a long time?  Bloody fn hell !
P.S. That Valeton mini wah/volume pedal is in my crosshairs. I'll have to wait until boxing day to pull the trigger, but I think that has to happen. (thanks Lee and Pete)
I think the Bugera v22 was a great choice, but I think a Catalyst 100 should have made the list. I have one, so I'm biased. But I think it takes pedals brilliantly. (thanks Ross) I only use the clean and crunch models with my Lightspeed (thanks Pete) Bad Horse, (thanks Lee, klon clone shootout), Joyo Sweet Baby (thanks Shane), OCD (thanks D&M) TC Spark, (thanks Pete, D&M) and lastly my Plethora x5 (thanks again Lee) For me, everything sounds spectacular through the Catalyst.
I would choose the Bugera V22 as well I had one and sold it like a dumbass and really wish I hadn't.
As a Chicagoan, I feel attacked by Pete’s fake accent
These videos were more fun when you guys just went through the store grabbing stuff off the racks. Watching you guys browse your own website is kinda boring.
This was a fun video. All those years of demoing gear really paid off for Pete.  Also "PRICE CHECK!" 😄
Tone is in the fingers - ultimate proof !
The bugera sounds very "AC/DC" hard rock
Damn Lee and Pete. I want one of those Classic Vibe Purple Teles now 😂
I've nearly bought a Bugera in the past and I was really rooting for it, but the Katana actually sounded much better through the basic audio set-up at work - just a better-balanced tone. I'll listen again at home and I'm pretty confident the result will be different. I guess that's why using a variety of speakers is so important when mixing!
Pete is so super expereinced it's great to hear the way he approaches things as a "proper" gigging player rather than a "youtube" wannabe. He knew exactly what he wanted to achieve and what the best way was going to be. My guitar teacher is a proper musician like Pete and I'm always in awe of his incredible experience. Only years of proper gigs can give you that.
Sorry boys. Big name stuff to start is too costly.   Tone is in the hands 1st and in the amp 2nd. Everything else is seasoning to taste.   Gonna say 1k Fender blues Jr + Harley Benton guitar and pedals.
Not sure why the need the decibel restriction, it's gonna be mic'ed and sent to the P.A. anyway Just use one of them DSM & Humboldt Simplifiers
Another great video. What about a Boss IR-200 amp and cab simulator (or similar IR solution)? You guys reviewed it - tiny footprint, tons of options for changing tones quickly. Of course, I know pretty much nothing about live gig rigs. Would that be considered a rookie "cheat" move by The Captain and Danish Pete? Haha - probably, but seems like an IR pedal would be the fastest and easiest pick and even costs a bit less than the amps. Just curious if it's a viable choice or if I'm missing something...
This small dent in the lacquer makes Sire sound less bright.  🤦‍♀️
Bought a Durple this week  - my wife has wrapped it for Xmas for me!!
Bugera wins that 'shoot out' for me!
These hypothetical tragic scenarios. Never cease to make me smile! Haha. Love Danish Pete. 🙏
Pete would have gone with a 1970s Kay or Satellite Les Paul copy, Line 6 Spider Mk 1 and a Boss Metal Zone, but only the Metal Zone was in stock.
Lee went on "damage control". JUST LET THE MAN BE HONEST!
A Spark amp into a cab via a soundcard plus the guitar of your choice= very inexpensive gear for not too sucky sound!
My heart breaks every time Pete placed his coffee mug on a table.  Because there's no weird sound of glass breaking, and it's disappearing or teleporting to another place.
There’s an undertone in this video that seems to suggest Pete isn’t getting paid enough to cover the rising cost of his commute. Time for a strike!!!!
The Bugera is more lively because it's a tube... LOL
Love your show and both your humor.  Great guitar show and so informative 👏
bugera win
This was fun. Guitar and amp were quite predictable. The pedal choices were the most interesting - what does an actual working backup back-up musician need and can rely on. Not some rock star fantasy rig. Real "this is my job" attitude. This is also a great "don't care if it's stolen" rig for someone who has a house full of rare and expensive gear but wants to play gigs down at the pub.
Bugera sounds better to me.
Flight cases?
I had the Bugera.. Decent clean channel albeit a bit bright. The dirty channel was utter garbage with the reverb being poor as well.  Eventually I sold it and bought an old 90's Fender Deluxe solid state amp.
NGR I absolutely love Pete’s banana yellow G Shock
"Employee Discount" LOL Great video guys! Please take it to the drum room and lets hear it with a drummer and bassist...
Surprised no ones just gotten a cheap Helix Stomp and ran direct into front of house
13:43  That's not true! Pete was paid in *EXPOSURE!* The most highly sought after currency just after "money".
I play fiddle mandolin acoustic and electric guitar. How about a rig for me?
The major lesson here is don't take the captain with you when shopping. 😂😂😂😂👍👍👍🥃Respect to you fellas
This back-story is hilariously f***ed up 😂😂😂 couldn’t have just said that there’s an emergency gig and he hasn’t got anything with him other than £1000?…..
Clearly he had no Boss pedals on his original pedalboard if everything got destroyed
Excellent video! Cheers from Chicago / USA!
Momma told me not to come - 3 Dog Night classic
It may be December but it's always snowing when pete is here.  Love the videos!
now this was in the top5 informative videos you have put out - ever! Not because of the final products chosen but the things Pete takes into consideration. Thank you for that!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!  Pure Gold!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Thank you Danish Pete for your brilliance.
Is it me or has the Captain hit a couple of lines before this vid? Great vid btw. fun to watch!
Sounded like some funky wah wah from James Brown's killer album 'Little Caesar'. Had my feet tapping and my head a bobbing.🙂
Bugera sounds soooo much better, and like Pete said, "it's organic sounding".
I was so excited to see this and I am not surprised he went with the Squier Classic Vibe, but his approach was different enough from everyone else. This is a great series. I want to see Captain Lee do it, but he might be last.
You can put a $100 guitar in some peoples hands, and they still sound like a Pro. Pete is just one of those players.
Gretsch and a Katana and I’m good
Which finish does the Anderton's purple cover on CV Teles? Burst?
I'm sure this has been answered before, but what is the seemingly random 3 digit number generator on the right hand side of the set?  Edit: nevermind it was answered in the video literally 5 seconds after I posted my comment. It's a decibel meter
Any Squier and a Katana artist series. Done.
Don’t forget the plectrum !
Please do one of your year end xmas party videos this year.
for me...the Bugera sounds better!
In 30 years Danish Pete gets a Senior discount!
What? Destroyed the purple tele? Victory Amp? Sounds like a purplish nightmare!!! No😢
Silence of the lambs
I much preferred these videos when we got a little tour of the store too! This format is fine but walking around the shop gave us the opportunity to see Andertons which is great for people not near Guildford/UK! You'd always spy interesting gear in the background too!
I don't know why he chooses Pedals anyway? Could have saved on them big because all of that is built in into the Katana at least. And saving on Pedals would have given him the opportunity to choose a Boss Katana Artist, which because of its different Speaker, would have sound more similiar to the Bugera.
What cab setting is the katana on? That makes a big difference to the sound and pedals
Great video guys hello from El Rito, New Mexico USA 🇺🇸 🎄🤘😃
I take year breaks from watching Andertons because the more they are in my Algorithm, the more my bank account shakes.
Haven't been able to play for 3 months thanks to Tennis Elbow. Hearing Pete play makes me happy 👍
One of my favourite amps is still by far the Yamaha THR5. So versatile!
Who was that purple telecastered man???
I thought the Bugera sounded boxy and nasal.  Katana was more full range with clearer top end.
No background ! Your at the mic...  And strangely enough, sing like Steven Tyler...  Just run out like Rory...
Everyone seems to include the Katana in cheap gear shutouts but Nobody ever picks the Fender GTX100 Amp to include in a shootout. When you figure in all the on-board effects the $499 or so price is more than cheap enough to include in any gear shootout. The tube Amp may still win but I think the GTX would more than hold its own against the Katana IMO,
That was great fun.  Cheers!
I've got both amps and I'm gigging with a Katana head 100 mkII.  The Bugera sounds better here because it is plug and play. The Katana needs some tuning, especially the global eq and the speakers from the combos need some breaking in.   If you set it up, the Katana can sound quite a lot better then the Bugera and it is much more versatile as well as being lighter.  Without setup, like you did here, the Bugera wins.
Bugera V22 is a great clean platform, does not distort on the clean channel and takes pedals great
You guys gotta get the new Hiwatt solid state in there. It's truly a nice amp!
Bugera, hell babe and squier winners
Those shoes are fire Pete!
Lol Lee...Let Pete choose what he wants.
Just starting this one but if Pete ends up getting the marshall origin then I will be upset
There’s something about the valve amp that just sounds more complex and interesting
Squire CV Tele punches way above its weight, I’ve had one and regret ‘upgrading’ to a different Tele. For me personally the Katana was very compressed and I much preferred the Bugera. Maybe the Katana could be adjusted so it is not so flat.
"But it's a colour that only Andertons have ..." -- Yes, but purple sounds better. You can't argue with science. 🤣
I really want to believe that the strings on the CS Tele were very very, very, weary. Because boy did the Squier sound bettere to me.
I guess maybe I’m a little bit of guitar snob. So I have never even tried a Squier. But, it really sounded good.
i love a good cheese danish
It would be fun to see all the same guys do a 2,000 or 2,500 rig
bugera sounds better 4 sure
Great vid.  Hello from belgium.
I have that Bucket Brigade delay and I kinda hate it. Pete plays one and it sounds great. The pedal might not be the problem. 😐
The Behringer Hellbabe is a good wah for £50.
Memory is a funny thing. I thought the Bugera sounded warmer and more pleasing to the ears. I just hope it lasts. I had two Bugera Tri Recs that died untimely deaths and I had to take em back. I couldn't get another one cuz Mesa Boogie sued em because they copied the triple rec circuit and it actually sounded better than a Mesa.
Hahaha the random "kill him" shouted from behind the camera when the non valve option was selected got me good!!
Brilliant guys, really enjoyed that one! 👍
Confused. Are you saying Anderson's at the start of the video? Anyway, good video.
Bugera needs more respect, there amos are killer these days
The "Goat'" 🐐
Gents, isn’t it “Angel Wing”?? That’s got to be a typo…
purple Tele shows not available in the US... Poo      I've got the bullet one, kind of want the classic vibe.
what?? no chords???.
Lee & Pete, please do another Christmas Day Hot Sauce/Brussels Sprout Challenge. I enjoyed it immensely. It made my Christmas.
why  not the 100 watt GTX please?
Can you buy Fulltone and keep the Ranger CS and MiniDejaVibe production going?
I'm absolutely gutted y'all can't send that purple Squier Tele to the USA. Great choices, Pete! Love the series. Also, Justin Sandercoe needs to be on this series!
Such a great series. I don't normally put too much stock into amp comparisons via sound over YouTube, but based on this demo I am stunned how much I prefer the Bugera amp here. It shouldn't surprise me given that I prefer tubes in my hifi system as well, but if I was making the calls here it would be an easy choice for the amp.
Pete, Pete, Pete ..you are slipping. You didn't buy any picks to throw out to the girls!
The evidence is out there, he made the gig on time! https://youtu.be/l1sC9hms1vk
Don't censor yourself fellas. You're making it easy for "them"
Maybe a future building upgrade would add a few rows for an “audience.”  Charge a few quid.
Love the channel and content. I can't believe you guys still, after all this time working together, have such a hard time not speaking over each other. It's impressive how much it happens, assuming by accident. Must be a British/danish thing.
I enjoyed this experiment. Hearing Pete’s thoughts about replacing his rig on a budget was fascinating. The gig is tonight. There’s no time for learning anything new. Go with what you know. Very cool
For my money, this absolutely killed. Well done. I’m thinking about getting that bucket, brigade, and king of blues
the amount of stick rabea and matt got for using marshall dsl40... jebus, the amount of videos that have been made with katana...
I bought a Catalyst 60 recently - traded in my Blues JR and I think I got the better end of the deal
Here is my rig for under 1k off the Andertons websites right now. Silver Sky Se and a Mustang GTX 50. 599 + 375.
"But I gotta *_dance_* now!"
I don't know if I should be proud of this, but I'm much better at using the Andertons website than Pete... 😭
Purple telle for the win
We need to start doing cables and power in the cost of everything because people may not have them or they may have been destroyed in crash
Pete fronting Tom Jones at the Driftbridge Hotel eh?
The Bugera sounds immense! Would definitely be my choice over the Katana that sounds like an "average" amp to beginners/home players! I would consider the Katana tone in a similar way that I consider PRS pickups... Just average! Nothing offensive but lacking a lot!
It's not unusual to have a tuner as an essential pedal but I don't see one.😄
You guys need to get Pete to design a signature edition amp or multi effects.  Limited edition Andertons. With guitar lessons Andertons Channel!
Bugera by far
Love these what if vids. Thanks for the upload. Pete definitely knows how to choose a good sound on a budget.
Squier CV, Bugera and a boss SD1 and it’s settled. Or Epiphone LP jr., Peavey Bandit and a tone city king of blues. Sweet video!
I love how guitar players play two totaly different brand guitars and go WOW, these sound different, I think it's the rosewood fretboard I'm hearing
Pete is simply the greatest guy
It's nice to see that inflation hasn't yet completely killed off the chance for finding decent deals on a good set up.  Just this month I bought a Squier brand for the first time in 8 years. It was a Jazzmaster, because I already have 2 Tele's. Merry Christmas
I feel like you guys could do a series where the Captain picks out a rig for a guest and then they have to try it out.
I'd give my house to play like the Dane, well, almost.....
Great video. I have only one suggestion. IMHO the amps sounded so good with the room mic that you guys should always add a little of that mic on the videos. Afterall the majority of buyers will play these amps at home.
Really enjoyed this.
In comparison the Bugera sounds so much better for my ears. Espacially with gain. Great vid fellas
The bugera was hands down the better sounding amplifier of the two. The katana was thin by comparison.
£1000 and no tuner? I hope he stays in tune all night lol
i started with a katana 100, then got the Bugera V22 as my first tube/valve amp, and now I run them both in a budget stereo rig with a PodGo as the preamp with my analog pedalboard in its loop. It's a pretty sweet setup tbh
Before I even see what he picks off of the website, I'm gonna guess the guitar will be a Sire.  Edit: Damn, so close!
Nobody's gigging without a tuner boys!
Pete, you are the best. I really enjoy seeing someone who makes the internet suck a bit less!!! I am a fan my guy! Long live Andertons, too. CAP10 is a legend too. Now just get Rabea to stop by more! Just a wish…
I have to say, this video is excellent.
Surprised Pete didn’t go for a Victory DP40? I guess they’re “free” when it’s your signature model? Then you’ve got a grand for everything else! 😂
Pete’s Tele sounds thin as…
Squier classic vibe tele (purple) Fender champion 100 , Boss ME-80.
That squier classic vibe is the standout of this video, if money wasn’t an issue I’d buy one now
A Katana 50L (for loop) would be an instant buy. Let’s make it happen.
Bugara sounds miles better to my ears. The katana is too harsh.
Pete, You've got nice collection of Casios.
My band supported TJ on tour. My stage monitors alone were 20kw - so you might not need much volume on your stage amp after all. :)
Well TBH, I think you gave a real interesting option about using the PA system mic up. Interface - Scarlet Mono - 99 pounds, comes with plugins Software - Bias FX2 Pro- 99 pounds (or whatever you may like) Guitar - GRETSCH G5655TG ELECTROMATIC CENTER BLOCK JR. IN BLACK GOLD $750
Forgot 9 volt or power supply for those pedals.  AND the amps were not EQ'ed for a similar clean sound, ERGO the pedals are not going to sound the same through them.
Guys you have to do a video of you both choosing 1 Guitar 1 Amp and 1 Effect...The Both Of You Please 🤜🤜😀
Bugera all the way. Could give two 💩s about all the features. Sounds like 💩.
I wonder what power setting the katana was on and if setting it at a lower wattage and cranking the clean would have gotten the two closer in terms of tone.
You are becoming boring and old by the day........Tom Jones......pop guitarest....let's get back to rock man
I am not a pro by any means, but I have tried the Katana and Line 6 Helix and they all sound okay, but nothing like a decent valve amp. There is just something about them that feel digital and not as good as a valve amp. Some bands get amazing sounds from them live but for me at home the helix just sounded like a digital thing that is too complicated  to get a natural sound out of it without messing with parameters called negative tesla phantom gain and increasing the global interactive -2000k radiation control.
The Sire headstock annoys me…
#FreeTheStaxMaster.
Gone through a whole herd of cows milking this concept
Perfect video in all aspects. Also most ppl do shop online now..
That Classic Vibe Tele sounds terrific! (Well, Pete's tasteful playing gives it a boost.)
It would be awesome to hear what Pete was thinking without the constant speaking over him.
Pete is a great guitar player..
A couple of years ago I bought a Fender Player HSS strat and a Katana 50 MKII for under $1000 and couldn't be happier.
I’ve been using a Katana 100 mk2 for a couple of years as a clean pedal platform.  I loved my hot Rod deluxe but it became unreliable.  So far the Kat is plenty good for my average playing.
No way, an inexpensive purple Telecaster into an inexpensive tube amp. Such a surprise.
COME ON THE BUGERA, FAB GIG SET UP PETE.
this was great! reflecting on what Pete said about law of diminishing returns, it`s a great point! .I'd love to see an episode where you add more and more expensive components to the entire rig (instrument, amp, pedals, cables, etc.) and compare the quality of the sound by price range. I truly enjoy watching your videos, keep it up!
no reverb? no fun!
I was wrong, I guessed he'd picked a G&L tribute asat in that pricerange
"It puts it in the basket!"  A Silence of the Lambs reference in an Anderton's vid?  WHAT?
Will the same principles apply if I just want to buy this as a Christmas present for somebody? I don't necessarily want to be rear-ended in broad daylight outside your shop in order to qualify. Please advise.
Pete, I think what Lee is actually telling you today is he would refuse to extend you any credit beyond the limits of what you have in your wallet when you walk into his shop.  Some friend *he* is, huh?  That's a joke 😊
I would buy a spark amp 80s strat Greco , tokai or 77 E S Anderson strider MIJ Strat
Love Danish Pete.... and the Captai! Best you tube duo ever
The Bugera sounds too boxy to me!
£631.00 left to spend surely ?
he dont consider multifx
Great ep fellas
Put a good speaker in a Bugera and it will shine!
I have a purple Strat behind my back, delivered 2 days ago and i have to wait till xmas eve to unbox it! It's killing me....🎸🤘🎸😆
The Katana 100 does take pedals better, as that has an FX loop and the 50 doesn't if I remember correctly?
Captain ya gotta stop influencing as it came across why have ya gone for the tele style etc, you gave a scenario of him and his gear had gone, so HE picks what's best for HIM.. not you.. I thank you :) much love
One question from non - british: if you work on some shop (not as YouTube star) how much you earn a week or month? Ís this one thousand a monthly pay and after a gig fridge will be empty? :D
Burgera is ice picky in comparison in my headphones.
Love this series!!
A rig without a tuner and spare strings should be disqualified 🤔
Please god can we get past the Xmas videos. How much money do you need.
............join our club!
Nice rig! Audio is not in sync btw...
Surprised the Fender amp was not considered
Orange Super Crush 100 Combo amp Squier Classic Vibe Telecaster Bunch of pedals Win!
Next one Danish Pete eats 1000 Danish Dream Cakes (Drømmekage)
My guess..classic vibe...Katana...tone city....( 2outta3.. Brugera sounded good  actually)...
We'll know Pete is really famous when Tom Jones name drops that he once played with Danish Pete.
Yes! been waiting to see Pete do this one
Love the video concept, can we please have Dave simpson choose a rig under 1000 and his ultimate rig if he had a choice ( no limits )
He should have picked the LANEY CUB-SUPER 12 15W for the amp
DP could get a 10W practice amp, dime it and sound glorious. Unparalleled dynamics.
Do we assume Boss pedals survived the accident?
I love the show guys keep it up
How much Purple can you get for a grand?
Pete seems like a pretty cool guy and an awesome guitarist
insta like
I understand you are trying to plug your online presence but the older videos where you would go through the store to find equipment were more interesting as you got to see more.  Still love the videos though so keep them coming!
It always amazes me that not only is Pete fluent in English but he speaks as if he is English, with all our slang and stuff.
"Choose yer' Rig" a nymphomaniacs tale, lol.
Birthday party for the Captain
Squier with the purple tele!!! They know!!!
Danish plums
Yessir
Danish Pete always knows what’s good! 😎👌🏻
