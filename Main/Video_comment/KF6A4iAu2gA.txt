the arsenal
Vamos barcą 💙❤️
4/5 of the Spanish teams progressed to the next stage as group winners: outstanding!
Why would anybody choose john terry for something like this he is a two timing backstabbing trouble maker who has no idea of loyalty
Where’s Jarvo?
Yes Arsenal ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
Arsenal FC are the Dark horses this year in the CL. I think they could go far.
how tf do city always get the easy route lol copenhagen
They need to blindfold the ball drawer
I see they put the ball of Man City’s opponents in the microwave again, before the draw
Why is John Terry involved? ...😮. Wheres
No one talking about how psg got the easiest first place team 💀
Who did Liverpool get ,, city for life stay mad
And cue the city got the easy draw type cr@p...no rag fans will say it, its the luck of the draw,if your not in the ucl? Stfu
Man city always be getting easy draws ☠️😑
JT looks drugged up
Just clicked  this to see who Liverpool have got and I forgot we are not in it!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤩
I knew City would get Copenhagen. Saw that coming as soon as Copenhagen qualified.
Man City again with an easy Draw
15:25 Porto v Arsenal COYG🥰❤🤍
Which teams can face each other in the semis?
Not to see my team on the list is embarrassing
It's arsenals year won it so many times haven't u 😊😊😊
Who did man u get 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who did Aldershot draw.
I would've so wanted to see a PSG vs Man city, but both of them got the easiest draw they could have gotten from their respective pots... 🙄
4:00  Stream Starts
Imagine getting someone of John Terry's ilk to present this. A man that encapsulates all that is wrong with football. A 1st class nobber in all aspects.
Always helping the bigger teams
Only two games have much jeopardy....but it's becoming an elite vs elite, money vs money competition. Love to see Sociadad win it, after Arsenal that is....fingers crossed.
I thought that guy came out and said thanks peado to the host 😂
I thought the guy with the glasses was Ranieri😂
brah idk why but how come it looks like all those games were set up lmfao
rigged
Porto! Could have been better, but could have been worse. Rather Porto than PSG or Napoli.
Well, City & Arsenal couldn't have wished for better draws.
Arsenal fans crying cos they got Porto and Porto are previous winners 🤔 20 years ago they won it 😂😂😂😂 arsenal fans borrowing victim hood from Liverpool fans at the moment
Why were Madrid unable to play 3 teams from separate countries
Really like Leipzig this season but Real will have Vinicius back then
Why couldn't PSV face Real Madrid?
All dead games to watch
UTV
Typical mancs buy their way through games as normal
Arsenal > Porto Barcelona > Napoli PSG > Real Sociedad Inter > Atleti Dortmund > PSV Bayern > Lazio City > Copenhagen Real > Leipzig  ... Quarters are going to be mental if all the favourites get through!
Coyg!!!
Come on Arsenal! ❤
I wouldn’t be surprised if PSG find a way to bottle against Real Socieodad
Terry publicly wearing the footballers' obligatory Patek Aquanaut...just to stick two fingers up to the average working man!
Who has Chelsea got next season lol 😂
They need to do this whole CL draw again as I didn’t see who Man Utd got??😂
Who did united get ?
Please explain why Copenhagen can only get man city and not real. Copenhagen is not on the same group and association with real.
Stating clearly firstly, that John Terry is considered to be honest, and nothing insinuated here of any rigging, but in the interest of transparency, think that Terry, or any other drawer,  should have been required not to see the balls being put in the bowl, nor watch them being mixed around. There is always the possibility, with not looking away, that any eagle eyed drawer might spot a home team ball. Highly unlikely in this case, but nevertheless possible. This is a UEFA shortfall in planning. ps for clarity, other than patriotic supporting UK teams against foreign opposition, I do not support either Arsenal nor Man City, and presume neither does John Terry.
All the City Haters crack me up😂😂😂 rent free in their heads !!
february srsly?
Saudi money working again.
This used to be  for the Champions of each country then changed  to the Champions league  with 2nd 3rd 4th 5th runners up....its a money spinning joke
The draw makes no sense literally no gain for topping a group and why can't same country play each other...so corrupt
Can anyone explain why PSV couldnt draw Real Madrid
Every one knew City was gonna get the easiest draw, this is becoming routine now. Add another charge to their 115 for this 😂
Should be all names in hat,this keeping teams apart makes a mockery of a champions tournament.
sociadad have a good chance against psg
Vamos madrista ❤
Hala Madrid! Bellingham will carry Madrid to a champions league trophy.
I said it few days ago. Manchester City will get the easier opponent because they pay the way
What a ridiculously complicated, overblown affair. 16 teams to match up, but about 100 balls, in 8 different bowls? 🤣🤣🤣
Good draw, some weak teams paired together so blockbuster games to come but Atleti-Inter will be fun
Where is man utd ?
John Terry... Lock up your grannies, mums etc
Copenhagen Man City isn’t an easy game
Saying Man City get easy draws is a myth
Who did liverpool get??
I'm surprised Real Madrid didn’t get a bye...
Predicted these before, ironically the only one I got right was citys🤣 just somehow knew they were gonna get copenhagen
The way they do this draw is designed so the big names can’t really meet til further in the competition, it would be much fairer if all where in one pot
Im saying munich or city are winning the ucl this..as a spurs fan i couldnt bear watching Arsenal win it
I recon real madrid and Bryan Munich in the final
ofc City get the easier tie
I knew it city would get copenhagen LOL😂🤦‍♂️
COYG!!!!
According to this comments section, every team has the easy game
Arsenal Porto, Inter Atlectico, Napoli Barcelona 🔥🔥🔥
I knew city were going to get Copenhagen the moment Copenhagen qualified😂
This will be an exiting champions league year!
Why couldn't lazio get man city
To clear up any confusion, Man City couldn't play Lazio because Leipzig had to get Real Madrid due to them being German and in Man City's group and Copenhagen being in Bayern's group which meant Bayern had to play Lazio. Therefore, Man City had to play Copenhagen.
Let’s be honest here: football is and has been dead for years now. Not only do the richest teams always get the best players, coaches, managers, stadiums, brand deals etc., but they also have the most bribery money.
Arsenal will lose to Porto
Arsenal 🥳
Quarter Finals prediction: Arsenal, Napoli, Sociedad, Atletico, Dortmund, Bayern, City, Madrid
There will be a lot of big games that I can’t wait to watch. Porto isn’t a bad draw for us but I can’t wait for the ucl r16 to start. Can’t wait for inter atleti, arsenal Porto and Barca napoli
I missed it 😑
Arsenal are crying after realising they will face Pepe 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who have utd got ✌️🙄
Are both legs at the Emptihad too!!
Lazio can’t face City or Madrid. Why
Real Madrid with the easiest teams every year 😂😂😂
Come on Arsenal !!! 🫡😉
Arsenal will win the 2023/2024 UCL
PSG GET AWAY
Did John Terry have his strip on!! 😂
Wow psg inter napoli is there but city got copenhagen????
More footie
Skip to 14.45 for actual draw
Watch city get Copenhagen
The bitters saying it was rigged.
Inter vs Atletico and Leipzig vs Real Madrid will be great games
Why couldn't Lazio get madrid or city?
If all the obvious teams (the big clubs) win their matches. The quarter finals and further on into the ucl will be very entertaining. Only big games.
City with the easiest draw, what a surprise 😱😱😱😱😱
city gonna run it back
Not even hiding it anymore
They aren’t even trying to hide the fixing anymore 😂
No hard feelings but I can say it was a good draw
Barca already lost😂
Draw in full  Arsenal Vs Porto  City vs Copenhagen  Inter vs Atletico  Real Madrid vs rb Leipzig  Barca vs Napoli  PSG vs real sociadad  Psv vs Dortmund  Lazio vs Munich
man city and psg oil money in works again the beautiful game is ruined
Arsenal and man city getting the easy games
Everyone saying it’s rigged because they didn’t get the draws they wanted 😂💀
This was so rigged
City always getting rigged draws
why PSV could not face Real Madrid?
ez draw for bayern
Barca gone😂😂😂
GONNA BE A GOOD COMPETITION 🎉🎉🎉❤
Mancity vs Copenhagen
Why was Real Madrid blocked off for every club at the end
Inter - Atleti looks the tightest tie there. The rest fairly favourable for the bigger names
AWESOME
Common Arsenal😍
rigged
Can’t wait🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
