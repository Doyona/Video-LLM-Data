The best pack!🐇
I wish you guys added bunnies as pets you could have!,But I love the whole pack it’s like a dream I can finally have a cute farm
I'm not sure if I'm the only one who is trying to figure out the voice of Harold. I'm thinking Warwick Davis but I'm not sure. Does anyone know???
manure is the word for the waste product produced by farm animals. Then you can compose it and create fertilizer. The non-word shiz is wrong. Companies like electronic arts aim products at children and developing minds. Teaching words that are a devotion of langue is damaging. This negative impact is irresponsible. Either ban all under 25 year olds from your contact or use a dictionary. Wrong words are a waste of time.
Please bring back the burglarsssss
I have always wanted to raise animals in Sims. Pets didn't gave us chickens, hens, roosters, cows, sheep etc. Very good to see EA and Matrix made that childhood dream cometrue. The unicorn seem to have disappeared but the Cow Plant came back limao.
i dont understand how they organize their packs, the horse pack should've been part of this pack same thing goes to parenthood and growing together smh
this is the last good expansion pack at EA released. the rest are garbage. growing together doesn't even feel like a pack, it feels like you need to pay $40 to get the other half of the base game you were supposed to get.
I don't have access to my email to get the verification code please someone help I lost so much
Don't buy this! 2 years problems with this game! The animals disappear and others problems with no corrections!
The last good Sims 4 pack ❤️ each pack released since then is horrible, buggy mess
Not the Sims 2 burglar music for the foxes lol
3:56 ist this an actual lot in the game or did someone maybe rebuild this and upload it to the gallery?
AMO TANTOOOO
Please bring pigs
Who is here watching this after being disappointed by the horse ranch gameplay trailer?
I was sooo happy and super duper excited for this pack I love farming, and animals, and more importantly growing your own food
Whats the name of the house used in this? 😭
cows are way better than llamas!!
As a brit, I loved this
Note: the only person who can do a Richard Ayoade narration is Richard Ayoade!
Hello im Harold,YES IMA LLAMA
NEW PACK IDEA:Royal Family’s (you can become a royal family/queen/king!!)
I am laughing when the voice actor is a llama They should add: - Playable Llama (added to household) - Llama as a teacher (HSY) - Llama can have a job - Llama can have skills - Llama can ride a bike - Llama can die in many ways (not like neglect like cats & dogs)
They should’ve add horses😡 in this pack
Dw I chose you (white llama) in my household
What do you play this game on? PlayStation,  Xbox or computer?
one of the best expansion packs
THE HOB still cracks me up :D
Llama: the animal shed is a great place for a romantic gesture   Me immediately: IT'S STARTED IN THE HAY-LOFT A CREAKIN! WELL IT JUST STARTED IN THE HAY!!
Simple Living is too much trouble for me, even in a video game.
This is so cute
graphics look sooo dated
Bruh my cottage living pack won't show up in my game :(
I have an idea that people will actually like! Can u make it so we can control animals without mods or money? It can be a little gift update :) And if u want add maybe a “hunt” option when your playing the animal if u click on it :> ( definitely not Warrior cats challenge- )   Edit- I’m not meaning this is a bad pack btw
Doesn’t harold sound like smallishbeans? or is it just me.
Bonjour est-ce qu'il peut avoir des pack gratuit sur Xbox one svp
Need a Sims 4 carnival expansion pack
After buying and downloading this pack. I have soo many glitches on the PS4 and no fix. Wtf man
This looks so cute!
Very beautiful content new friend here. Thumps up
Im so sad I can't get that bike 😢
😍👍🏽
even though this was 6 months ago i just wanna say how nice it is that the sims 4 is trying to improve
okay..hear me out.. sim 4 Bon Voyage. That expansion pack was everything, and i need a modern update of it instead of this....
Para cuándo en Nintendo Switch?🥺♥️
PLEASE. Can you bring a height difference to the game? Other features that make people different. This is the biggest deficiency in the game. Everyone is the same height and weight. Please we would love for this feature to come!
Wtf simulador de mexico 😱
CADE O CAVALOOOOOOOO
Me wants to build a cottage but feels unmotivated  Me watches trailor IM GONNA ONLY BUILD COtTAges FROm NOw ON
Dear The Sims 4 official, i really want to share ideas for your next expansion, i think everyone gonna buy it since we need a view after two years covid19. When your sims had a lot of money every-things get boring, thats why you should make us spend the money.  1. How about add more travel place referring to real country? romantic city like Paris, Unique like Santorini Greece, and more country people “goal to-go-to”  2. Make a Hotel in country you made, with different price and services with call (restaurant,…etc) casino?? 3. Made a Visa for sims. As accomplishment, as a traveller (you should make it as a trait). 4. Expand the job, as a travel blogger/vlogger, model, or singer who can work in other country, make it business trip for other career? interchange student?   Sorry i’m just Big Fan, hehe thankyou EA ♥ 🎄🎅🏼✨
Harold: *Appears* Me: Caaaaaaaaaaaarl
There's even petitions to bring the Sims 2 back on Origin or just bring the Sims 2 back in general other people want to play The Sims 2 I haven't played The Sims 2 like others have they are millions of people joining The Sims Community everyday
I know this is going to get a little hate but can we just talk about how EA took the Sims 2 off of origin like just because the Sims 2 is better than the Sims 4 doesn't mean you have the right to take it off I mean technically you do but it's money either way please get over it and please bring it back at least for a week at least. I rest my case
Ima get this and mass produce lamas
Can we get a roaring 20’s in the sims 4 pls 💗
Is it still broken or are they done fixing/patching it?
Still no horses 🤠
This is amazing I love this pack (I have it)

Hello sims! I have one idea for a sims pack, You dont have to do it its just a suggestion :)   Pack name : School life    Details: Its a Expansion Pack. 39,99   Infomation: You can go with u kids/teens to school now. You have 2 different primary schools and 1 high school. You can go with them and if you have 2 kids you can control both.  every 10 days you have a test and you get to learn 3 days until you have it. If you learn good you have a very good grade.' ( A , A+ , A- ) if you have thise your parents will give you a hug If you learn normal you have a normal grade ( B+ ,B , B-  ) if you have learned moderately for the test you have a change for ( C+ , C , C- ) if you learned bad you have a change for ( C , C- , D , D- , D+ ) if you have this your parents will talk about ur grade. if you didnt learn you have a ( E- , F ) Your parents will be sad and will talk with you about it.   You also have more activities after school. I have now - Acting & Scouts. Some more activities. Soccer - Basketbal - Gymnastics - Art .    Soccer practice: monday/wednesday/friday. 16:00 - until-  18:00 skill : sport  basketbal monday/wednesday/friday 16:00 - until -  18:15 New skill: Basketbal  Gymnastics monday/wednesday/friday/sunday Monday/wednesday/friday= 16:00 Until 18:15 sunday = 10:00 until 16:00 skill: Sportivity skill: Wellnesday skill (only if you have spa day)   Art Monday/wednesday/friday 15:00 - until - 17:00 skill: creativity   Primary school 1: simfalonia school. You learn : Math - history -  Art - Geography - simglish - Music - Science - Biology .   This school is a normal school If you misbehave your parents get called or you get detention. If you misbehave very badly you get suspended for 3 days. If you have low grades you stay in school until 16:00 everytime you have school until they get better. if you have very low grades you get tuition in your home and a tuition teacher comes in your home to help you with homework. if you have super super super low grades you get sended to Simlodirca school. If your skipping school a teacher calls you and gives you a warning and calls your parents (thats already in the sims)    Scedule:  Opening: 8:00 Math: 9:15 - until - 10:15 Geography: 10:30 - until - 11:00 pause: 11:05 - until 11:20 biology: 11:25 - until - 11:55 history: 12:00 - until - 12:15. Pause 2: 12:20 -until - 13:05. History: 13:15 - until - 13:30 Science: 13:45 - until - 14: 25. Simglish: 14:30 - until - 15:00   every friday Music replaces Biology. Every wednesday Art replaces Simglish.    Primary school 2: Simlodicra school. This school is good for kids who need rules and need to learn how to respect people but everyone can go to this school. you have a uniform. if you join this school you automatically get the choice to have tuition or not If you misbehave you get detention if you misbehave very badly your parents need to come to school and you get more homework and you need to go to school on saterdays for 2 weeks. if you have low grades you get a tuition without choice and you need to stay longer in school. if you have very low grades you cant go home for 2 days. (the people who like you will be very sad for 2 days) if you have super super low grades you get taken for 1 week and cant go home. if your skipping school your parents will get called and (if you have parentship pack) they can give you house judgment.     You learn: Math -  Histoy - Art - Geography - Neat and rules - Science -  Biology -  Simglish.  Opening:08:00 ( if you're late, you'll have to catch up on time after school ) Math: 08:30 - until - 09:30 Geography: 09:40 - until - 10:10 Biology: 10:20 - until 10:50 pause: 10:55 - until -  11:10. History: 11:10 -  until - 11:40 Science: 11:50 - until 12:15 pause 2: 12:20 -  until -  13:00  Science: 13:10 - until - 13:25 Simglish 13:35 - until - 14:05 Neat and rules: 14:20 - until - 15:30..  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ School details:  if you put your mouse over the SIM, you maybe see a label. if the kid is in your class the label will be blue. if the kid is in a other class the label will be red.  Labels: - Bully - Quiet kid - Populair kid - Funny kid - bullied kid - crush ( you can choose that one) - or kid without a label  You can choose who you wanna be friends with but it will be hard to become friends with the populair kid or the bully.  if you make a mistake with the populair kid, your reputation in school is ruined, you can only be friends with the quiet kid/the kid who get bullied or kids without a label or you try to make it up and if it works youll be unlabeled again.  If you make a mistake with the Bully you will get bulied and your label will change into (bullied kid) If you try to make it up and it works you will be unlabeled again or (opportunist).  If your around  ur crush your sim will be Perplexed or happy or scared. if you make a mistake around ur crush you will be embarrased.  you also have new interactions with kids  : "tell (the_name) who i have a crush on". Be careful that you tell the right people!! some may betray you and tell someone and before you know everybody knows.  "gossip about bully"  But look around you, They maybe hear it!  "tell crush you like them" if you tell them there are changes:  1.they reject you nicely. 2.They reject you meanly. 3.They reject you meanly and tell the whole school. 4.They like you back and then you have a boyfriend or girlfriend (but with no romantic interactions if youre a kid) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Thats it and you can also remove some of my ideas or add some!! I love ur game and i hope you have a good day! stay safe!! please copy so the sims sees this
Mrs. Crumplebuttom?
Hi Sims team sims is like my fave game I love the bella goth backstory but sometimes I wonder why you did not carry it on in the sims 4 I know sims is an ultimate world but bella goth had such a interesting backstory I would love to know what actually happened did the caliente do it what about don lothario has he carried on his ways also sims 4 should have more drama and better reactions from sims I know this is a lot to ask for but imagine how the gameplay would change I also know this is nothing to do with cottage living bye the way the cottage living has the cutest animals and I love the sims 4 it's a fantastic game but if u add some of these things the game play could be so much dramatic and emotional I'm not an expert on this stuff I think everyone wants dis to happen also I really hope in a couple years you will bring out sims 5 if u do please but pets in the base game This is way to much to ask  if added Like lore and being able to sew someone like if a sim fights you its illegal so you can sew them sorry for this extremely long comment I love the sims I just miss drama and backstory thank you sims team for giving earth the best game ever 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Can someone agree with me on this topic  We need an pack for each country and state like florida california  And imma keep on saying this into someone agree💚
i see you eggplant
Dear the sims, can you listen to my idea can you plz let people on apple or Samsung because I’m on mobile and I have wanted the sims 4 for a very long time thank you
Companies and developers out there, PLEASE! give us sims like game that not only for woman children and mentally retarded.
No matter what expansion EA adds, sims 4 is sad boring festival of stupidity! too easy too silly, EA you really learned to forgive yourself :)
Just wondering if u can do a baby update, like in Sims 2 and 3 u can take the babies anywhere but in Sims 4 they stay in a crib, it's okay if u can't tho 😁
عرب ؟

I’m having trouble placing the frost your house tall double door on a diagonal wall because it keeps adding these two small windows on the side of the door. If it didn’t have the two windows it would fit on the diagonal wall. Please tell me how to fix this

Where is Nectar Maker Carrer?
0:29
but pigs? 🧍🏽‍♀️
Where are the horses?????
Why tf are there llamas... BUT NO HORSES? This makes no sense to me whatsoever..
The Sims Dev Team stopped caring about their male audience a LONG time ago. They seem to only care about Women, children, and the LGBT-LMNOP-ETC groups. They want me to play the game like a middle aged wine Aunt doing the things she never got to do in real life. We can't get any Cool packs because Maxis is too busy pandering to niche markets.   Can we atleast get something for everyone like the Sims USE to do? We don't even have a pool table! Can we get a Man Cave stuff pack? Or maybe a Heros and Villains Expansion pack with new careers, occult options and new interactions (Maybe we could finally get burglars in the game). Or a Cyberpunk themed pack with glowing neon clothing pieces and futuristic hair styles and build items like futuristic sliding doors that make that woosh sound. Anything other than another pack made for female simmers.  They have made the game so lame, tame, and boring, console players are just stuck with it. They talk about diversity and inclusion so much yet they alienated a majority of their fans with these choices smh The game is now Estrogen driven and the male Devs are Male feminist Soy boys who go with the flow instead of challenging ideas and trying to be innovative and do equal things for straight male simmers.   The game is also still a buggy semi broken mess that needs major attention on console. That is all.  Dag Dag!
Boże cudowne muszę to mieć kocham was <3<3<3<3
I want to harvest the meat
Guessing this is the third-best DLC after Seasons and PETS. How many years did it take them?! Sims5?6?7? We are midway toward 2022. Just saying.
1:48 yeah... cooking... that's the dirty activity lmfao.
they really targeted this pack straight to the lesbians huh
What the hell is a Henford and why is it on a Bagley. Why couldn't you just name the place Henford? Nice, simple, no verbs, easy!
My game says I have it but when I try to play it says I don’t have it?!?
They should of just added Farm animals in Brindleton Bay(because it’s country and farm themed) but no EA have to make more overpriced packs so people can but so they can have fun sadly we wish that all the packs were free but sadly greedy EA ruined that and it will never happen😔
From where did you got the cd.
just eggs? i expect the fox leaves with the chicken XD
0:41 It seems like Jim Pickens is everywhere trying to spread his belief (Cult)
You guys are amazing! ♥♥♥
These graphics look so fkn ugly, why don’t they release a ULTRA TEXTURE PACK.
no pig?
Stardew valley: the expansion pack
I bought the game today but I don't have the three bonus objects in my game. How does it work do have them ?
I want THAT house from the thriler can someone make one
zajętego gnoma nie ma w wersji pudełkowej - przekonałam się na własnej skórze wczoraj kupiłam dodatek w empiku i niestety okazało się że nie dostałam tego zestawu   ;-(   EA to cios poniżej pasa - oszustwo..........naciąganie by nie czekać i kupić dodatek - a prawda taka jest że tego zestawu zajęty gnom nie udostępniliście ludziom co kupili w pudełkach.
SIMS The 4.  telefon
Can I say something there was a food that gordem remeys has made is anyone aware
IMHO next Sims Game should be outside Earth, something like building a  Colony on Mars, building a sustainable colony and trade resources with Earth. Would like to see  underground maps and minable resources. New Jobs like miner, scientist, maintenance, security, pilot, builder and have new jobs as the colony grows. Something more dynamic and with a significant research tree where jobs really matter.
the sims 2 burglar music triggered my fight or flight-
ok so like the fox be gone isn’t in the game….
Remember when this was just a stuff pack for Sims 3 for a couple of bucks? I miss sims 3 unfortunately EA is holding everything for ransom if I want to get back into it.
I bought this game in a box today and don't have the bonus promised. I feel scamed. You you did not say that the bonus is not in the physical edition. What I should do now? if you said about it, I would buy it in digital version.
Just gonna put it out there, this would've been the perfect pack for some kind of fairies
everey time i try getb somthin it says connect and i cant
I pre ordered mine but it's trying to make me purchase it again. When I click on the help option it pulls an error message. How can I contact ea?
installing it rn
I would have loved to have horses too, with this pack, but oh well
Please add horses i love horses
I am getting super inpatient how much longer do we have to wait i have been waiting since midnight for it
sims it's possible to have sims 4 on mobile gratui pleaseeeee
will you guys ever make the sims 4 free again origin?
Next pack: my first kid stuff 🥱
I didn't realize until his video yesterday that it was Babish's sim cross stitching in this trailer!
Дорогие наши разработчики игр симс сделайте пожалуйста дополнение с транспортом,и хочется что бы вы сделали ещё дополнение гости к бабуле что бы игра была более реалистичной
Pfff... still not as good as The Sims 3 and upcoming Paralives of which release date was announced 10 years ago. I still refuse to play this game and ofc any of its new expansion and will continue to play The Sims 3 while waiting for Paralives. Yes my TS3 save game is bloated and laggy af now but still it's better than TS4 because 3 > 4, simple as that. And yes Paralives appears to dominate TS4 once it comes out because I have more freedom creating my character and I can build my house with much more details and then just ... well, look at it. Anyway TS4 bad TS3 good.
Okay, but this is so cute???
FINALLY! your stepping up your game sims 4! THIS will make big bucks
я щас заплачу от счастья
anyone who got it who can reccoment or nor reccoment? please :D <3
Noice
Lol im playing it rn because my time zone and location is set to a early playing on Xbox soo im the first Xbox player to play cottage living of course im not gonna spoil it
This is very European vibes
hope the fps drops get fixed
The washer and dryer from laundry day stuff don't work now.
Yeah that’s cool and all but burglars? When???
Sims 5 lets go !!
The moment this come out I’m buying it !
Только не говорите мне что на эту игру до сих пор выходят дополнения
Next expansion please showcase the horses,  its damn obvious that you ignore the fans idea about horses for sims 4
I love you guys , such a dream come true... makes me want to cry
Whoooo is the cute guy at 0:25 thoooo?
Still no horses 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Lmao @ every livestock tender Sim being dark-skinned.
Finally, Harvest Moon remake in Sims 4 version👍🏻
I can't believe they finally added llamas
loving request.<3 could we please get more fun stuff in our mailboxes? like coupons, flyers, upcoming events in game, prank cards, money from friends and relatives ect. i would also like to order more fun stuff and grocery (food like whole cooked rotisserie chickens, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, and also ingredients) delivery boxes and food delivery from my sims computer!
When are they going to set up an electricity system? With cables and socket currents I'm already tired that everything works with wireless electricity
AAHHHH i am so excited! 😩
3:59 THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE BOP
Now that we have cow, and we have alien abduction. We should have cows get abducted too. lol
Nothing more aggravating than people calling out ea by being nitpicky brats rather than commenting on the company and games actual flaws
"Proverbial cow shizz" Lol
Me encnto el trailer y lo deseo comprar pero no tengo dinero
People be out there complaining about horses, but these were the same basic bitches who complained and wanted a farming pack.  Tbh, I'm excited, because this is something they haven't done before. I don't care about having horses, personally, if I want to ride around and look after horses, I would play Red Dead Roleplay (RedM.)  I'm excited about the gameplay potential and honestly, something that isn't american. The only issue I have is the fact that there is no door with a built in letterbox to accurately represent the UK. Legit, the average person isn't going to go outside in the pissing rain to get their mail, lol.
i loooooooooooveeee it
I can't wait for this! I will definitely use the family cooking and the groceries functions. Great base game update as well :-) Counting down the days.
Mark Corrigan the llama
It’s trailers like this that remind me I can’t build for crap.
I have a Favour to ask can you extend the sims 4 Ps4 discount because I get money at the end of the mouth it would be much obliged
How much storage does it take up! 😰
We want the horses baaaack!!
This is so cool but I would like that you include horses in the game too!! Like in the sims 3!! It would be so nicee and so coool
hi how do i put dlc to the sims 3 thanks

FINALLY THEY ARE GONNA ADD BUNNIES!!!
Omg, *its* *a* *talking* *llama*
The map....it must be a good one😭
Freue mich schon übelst digga
I love this so excited when it comes out !!!! 😁 I can hardly wait to play it
this voice actor destroyed Morgyn's lmao, sorry not sorry but he's awesome
Hmm this comments mighty positive I’m alittle worried
Please, add horses to the game and I don't need anything else to be happy 😍
I want pigs; (
now to find out if the maxis gallery will put out all those townies of sims that you don't see when watching the game changers LPs, like the pink-haired person with curly hair at 0:25 / the couple at 0:34 / the cheese-hair blond and girl with pigtails at 0:39 (and the guy agnis is yelling at) / all the sims during the Canning segment at 0:48 (the blond looks trans??? :eyes: ) / the family at 1:07 picnic / and all the other faces just not seen walking around 1:20 kid / 1:37 couple / 1:40 lady / 1:44 cherry dress gramma / 1:52 family / 2:04 "gran gran" XD / 2:46 (her outfit is wild but she's so pretty haha) / and don't forget the carrot guy from the other trailer
I started with the very first game at around 8. 21 years later, I still love the game and cannot wait for this dlc!! ♥️
It's ridiculous that fake bakery that you can only see a window...you from the sims 4 have lost the ability to captivate us...besides an expansion with only 3 animals !! do you stuff your creativity and money in a hole??? for God's sake stop just putting a shitty bar downtown in all the worlds you create!!
Midsommar vibe
No horses!????? And why not!? Why only chickens and cows!??
4020:is there sims 5 yet  the sims:nope 9402:Iis there sims 5  the sims:nope nope  the human died never playing sims5:
Please add a pack with horses ! Like a stuff pack or something 😭😭🥺🥺
can you fix the nifty knitting glitch where my sim can only frog projectd. I have tried multiple times to get my sim to knit. she spends 50 simoleons on a project and the action automatically disapears. she is not able to knit and only able to frog it. Ive tried this on rocking chairs, couches, and beds. PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
😍😍😍 the pack I will buy in a long time
Realise it sooner
Love your game play it every day
I'm just curious are these expansions/game packs developed by third party developers? They're really churning out sims 4 stuff which is weird because it's an old game so clearly it's still making money and quite a bit considering the pace new stuff is coming out. I'm surprised how much I enjoyed Home Decorator(or whatever it was called). It was good. I didn't like the star wars thing, it was very meh and bland.
Are you guys ever going to fix the Get Famous Expansion Pack? Why would I buy more when the ones I've bought are broken?????
This is what I've been waiting for!!!!!!!
Harold the Llama has got drip…
Harold the Llama has got the vibe
I was excited until I learned that the cows are basically just objects that are tethered to their barn
Why only Llama can speak a real-world-human language?
I am about to be a cottagecore lesbian
harold is beautiful
Wow shaking the burn is possible too nice
COW SHIZ🤣 IN A SIMS TRAILER🤣 take my money right now
Please make a chicken with my name tenchou!!!!
Where are the horses? No horses on sims 4 so far! Shame
I think you should make a baby pack for more clothes hairbands and like when you age them up they walk
me who has been dead on the sims community for over a year  this pack:**exists** me:"i'm back ho"
The animals don’t move…
IM DYING FOR HORSES!!!!!!!
I love the fact they expanded upon the foxes from Cats & Dogs-
Now all we need is horses
The fox is like the burglar okay we’re getting somewhere
I'm so excited bro
i am still waiting for horse XD
Does anyone else have like 15 mods that are literally this expansion pack but are going to get this anyways, or is it just me?
That's amazing! 🤩
You survival ends here We've come a long way from nowhere to prove, we were fit for survival Felt it all in my soul, told the world that we've made our arrival No more simulation, answered to the call Final destination, destined to evolve Is it human nature, the need to have it all From the start screaming I won't fall Feel it in my blood, deep inside There's nowhere left to run, nowhere to hide The day this all begun I made my mind I'm in this to thе end, one last ride Onе last ride One last ride One last ride One last ride We've come a long way to here, but, we'll never forget, where we started Can take out, all of the light but, I'm not afraid, of the darkness Searching for salvation, made it out alive Fighting for my name, setting fire to the sky Is it human nature, to live before we die I'm coming home, for the final time Feel it in my blood, deep inside There's nowhere left to run, nowhere to hide The day this all begun I made my mind I'm in this to thе end, one last ride Onе last ride One last ride One last ride One last ride I'm in this to the end, one last ride one last ride We did so much, more, than just survive one last ride Feel it in my blood, deep inside There's nowhere left to run, nowhere to hide The day this all begun I made my mind I'm in this to thе end, one last ride Onе last ride One last ride One last ride One last ride I'm in this to the end, one last ride one last ride
não vejo a hora de jogar
Wondering what weird stuff people at WW will come up with 🍆
Games 😲😳 wow
I spent an hour creating 2 sims and my game crashed so I had to restart and now I’ve wasted an hour of my life just because of a little bit of lag because it can’t save when your creating characters and because it crashed everything froze and I couldn’t move anything.
CAN I BUY IT WHEN IT COMES OUT
The way the llama shouted: "Ya all!!!" 🤣
Off grid/No more auto food/farming/Animals/Pets/sell or put food in contest ............   WE GONE FULL CIRCLE !! FINALLY AFTER 7 years !!
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
Love it! 😍🤩🤩🤩
Cockin bull torture😏😏
I *NEED* this pack when it releases.
1:30 Catch me getting hyped for natural-edged ponds tho??? hELLO????
Welp let me go ahead and empty out some space on my pc
The sims 4 é uma decepição.
How big of a pack will this one be? Is it the regular, Stuff or medium? It feels weird & fake to see other animals in this game's world. Even though this series started in 1999 (I think, maybe The Sims was released 2000), we haven't seen much verity in different sorts of animals. I'm way into animals & farming/gardening, so I hope it will go along well with Seasons & Pets.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
good bye 40$
This looks really cool but it’s expensive 😭
EA..to lazy and money hungry to make horses…modders…create horses
aaaaaaaaah I would love to get it but i don't know if it could run on my laptop... i mean,, i have all expansions except seasons and the one with mt komorebi and it runs kinda ok but i dont want to spend money only for it not working for me
I cant wait
waiting 24/7
I'm really excited for this but also trying not to be to optimistic since we all know what the sims is like..
Regardless of how this pack will turn out, this trailer is the most Epic one The Sims 4 has ever made haha. I can't wait to get the pack.
MAKE SIMS 4 ON MOBILE DEVICES!  I AM DYING TO PLAY IT BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A LAPTOP OR PC OR PS4
still waiting for horses lol
Im I the only one that calls this pack Cottagecore??
Call me when you have an open world without loading screens
Русские вы тут?
BRUUUUUUUUUUUU LLAMAS DON'T GIVE WOOL ALPACAS DO
Gonna start saving money from now 😢
This is a morbid thought, but I'm wondering if you can use the cows and chicken as meat...
JUNE 22 COME FASTER 😭😭
*The Sims:* _I doubt they will like this pack again, so let's throw in a llama._ 😉
You have NO idea how long I've waited for a mod that removes fridge shopping!! I can't believe they're actually making it a feature. I'm so afraid EA will ruin this pack but I can't stop watching and hoping!
Yet again this feels almost like a stuff pack at this point
AAAAAHHHH 🤩🤩🤩
I am so naming my cow tater and my llama harold. no ragrets                DONT BE SHY RELEASE IT EARLY
Lol they really do go overboard trying to shove every demographic in
looks like a modernized Harvest Moon
WHERE ARE THE HORSES
I'm really impressed by the voice actor on this. He did well.
can the sims have a reptile Expansion pack?
CHICKENS
This is all great but still no horses…😭
OMG I love it 🥰 😱
i love sims 4
I have LGR rewiew flashbacks...
i made my own "country living" neighborhood without the need for this pack
2040 :  The Sims have uploaded a new video  *The Sims 4 : Dictator’s life expansion pack*  Seriously though, I like them adding new cool ideas. I wish they added a war expansion pack. It’s like get to work style type of job, where you do goals or maybe even storyline, you’re a soldier in a camp, make new friends there and fight enemies. But that’s highly unlike Sims 4. I doubt it will ever happen. However I would love it as I always wanted to do a proper soldier Sim. Or a basketball player with actual sports careers expansion pack.
Hi sims makers i play sims 4 on PS4 i have figured out that u cant use mods and i really want to so pls can u add them to PS4
No horse?
Looks like my top Chef, Pat Pattyfuck, will have some more supplies to work with for his Pattyfuckers and Pizzahrea chains.
They coming up with no new ideas
This is the sims 3 or the sims 3 free play on mobile
I'm seeing loads of different mushroom plants and I'm excited
Please please please add Werewolves next!
Okay I can food IRL and you're telling me I can can food digitally now? I'm delighted
Fix the crashing
3:08 D-did I hear that correctly?
Estou muito animado para essa expansão, esperei muito por esse tema ♥♥
What about sims 5 though? Multiplayer please? And these packs are too expensive 40 each??
i’m still excited but it’s literally so hard to look at how much worse this is than arnie’s farmland trailer
Preorder bonus on eneba?
Please
Add a werewolf pack already
why do I feel like all the lesbians are wtahing
Will there be baby llamas 🦙 and cows 🐄? Can they mate? How many can we have on our lots? Can we add them to different worlds? The vacation ones?
So we're getting burglars... And they're foxes. I guess I'll take it
This is the most beautiful expansion pack I've ever seen. The detail is stunning! 😍
I hope this actually good. I quit this game a year ago
puaj, detesto las llamas
This is awsome, thank you very much for the packs lately! They are rich in new content and gameplay. I love graffics and themes as well. And if i can wish for sth, please, add music festivals, bands and horses and orient culture inspired  worlds (India, south afrika or safari, Spain, Israel Jerusalem etc.) in the future. 🙏😁
First pack I’m about to preorder
JAMS ARE BACK!!!!!!!!!! <3
If you are a 1D fan the lama Harold hits differently
i saw your new summer event, it means a showtime expansion is near?? 👀👀
"Let's assume you made the horrible mistake of buying another pack  unfinished and full of bugs for 70$. Back in the days, you would have to sell a finished game, i really missed thoses times, no wonder WHY no best game warranty on those packs, you can't get a refund even if it's unplayable.
Yall. It feels like they actually put effort into both the trailer and this one. The level of excitement for myself right now feels on par with sims 3 packs.
😍
sorry but the graphics are horrible ....
Mega ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh how i want to believe
Llamas, cowns, bunnies, chickens and pumpkins but still no horses. Lame
I- im scared.. is this actually.. what we asked for?!??
Tbh, this is what i wanted. The ability to make it so ur fridge doesnt have food and u have to go shopping for food makes it super realistic and makes game play harder which makes it more fun for me. I want them to add these options that make the game harder but keeping it optional for people that dont like the challenge like laundry day!
I am… impressed? Only time will tell if that will last. I hope so 😁
Ngl I was half expecting him to say, “CAAAAAAAARL!”
hi hello my sis loves the sim 4 and shes asking if you can make those houses in the back ground interactable because my sis said "sis you see these houses look this ones really cute but you cant go to it because its not apart of the game" so all im asking is in a fucher (sorry dont know how to spell it)update is that you make back ground houses interactable.BTW love what you do
I love llama's 😍😍😍
The best pack ever :D
We asked for it but I'm sure ea messed it up in some way and then we are left with the things being only kinda what we wanted
This just makes me wish that Pets had horses.
I'm in love ❤️😭.  A certain buy for me
Really happy with this gameplay trailer because now i know i won't buy it!  The Animal shed and Chicken coop are a NO for me and the animals are the biggest selling point of this pack. The fact that animals spawn from that and from that only is truly a mistake made by the Sims team as i don't see me plopping these 2D, 480p sheds in my builds, it would ruin the aesthetics of my builds and would not match any of my high graphic, realistic CC. If the animals were able to spawn from sheds we could build on our own i would have bought the pack instantly. So unless a modder makes a mod through which we can plop a tile or something on the ground for the animals to spawn from and then build our own sheds to our own liking and design around it, this one is a hard pass for me. Also don't get why the inside of the shed is a black hole to begin with in 2021 with all these graphics improvements, powerful laptops and the millions EA makes and THIS is what you produce? really?   Arnie managed to make animals (horses, pigs,sheep,rabbits,cows) appear on their own without being tied to an object, allowing you to build your own shed in their vicinity so i really don't understand why the sims team continuously drops the ball. Why a Llama? in the UK? you barely see them! Horses are much more likely to be found in the wild in the UK countryside. It's becoming downright shameful in 2021! The sims team is really unfriendly towards mature and seasoned builders as nothing in this game is made with architecture and individual gameplay in mind. Lots don't perfectly line up to sidewalks, line of tiles closest to sidewalks/egdes are not buildable, parks lots are randomly placed in the middle of nowhere, lots are too small or not enough, nothing works unless you are a 9 year old who doesn't pay attention to detail.   Sulani for example is one big mess which could have been so beautiful but the lots are placed wrong and the private island in Sulani should have been a bigger lot allowing you to build on the entire island and a bit of the water around it! Instead you can build on half of the island only? WTF? The sand in Sulani is also not white enough, it looks like a dirty western European beach and not that of a tropical island. For those of us who like building driveways, garages etc. in the SIms, there are only a handful of lots for that in all the worlds combined and only 2 of them are 64x64! I keep having to delete houses in order to build a new one!   At this point i want the sims to release a pack with only worlds! Stop trying to make gameplay, you SUCK at it! Modders are much better at it so leave it to them! Just like apple does, you can take the courtesy of notifying modders before a patch with the new coding! This will allow for a smoother transition for players who use mods and CC which is a large group that has stopped playing because your 'way too frequent' updates keep breaking their favorite mods and without mods they don't want to play. Make a world pack with 10 worlds covering all types of land, seasons and cultures and pay attention to detail so we, the builders can actually have something to work with! IF you won't do that, allow us to build our own worlds like we could before! We know you have the coding and knowledge to create a world building tool but you are afraid people will stop buying your packs when you give us that! I voted for a brazilian beach town long ago and still have not seen another tropical world aside from sulani! We need more tropical worlds because not all of us like cold and snow and fall and winter. Del Sol Valley is not labeled tropical and does not even have a beach to access!   Stop launching new gameplay and fix bugs from previous packs which we already paid for! improve the game first before you do anything else! IF a competitor comes by with a similar game tomorrow, you will be bankrupt within a week!   Once again, a big disappointment!
Please do not make Anybody! with a British accent say y'all again. My poor ears...
I would die for Harold the Llama and his wonderful sweater/glasses combo
"Hey can we have horses back"  "Best I can do is cow"
So all of the animals are considered objects and are tethered to the buildings, just like with babies? Okay
AT LAST! creative and unique addon. not simple ctrl+C/V from previous generations - well done :) Clever with that farm life i must say, and those competitions? nice.
Okay but the fridge thing is very exciting
I need this pack 😍😍
Make a car please
Voice actor? The guy that did you've been framed?
Was it that hard ? Like we ask for this for years !!!!!! FINALLY !!!!
I can't wait
yeah thats cool but we still don't have werewolves
I would love if they would add the possibility to have an animal sanctuary instead of a farm. You could register as a sanctuary and it would be your job to take care of the animals, to build a relationship with them, to raise funds and to have donation partys. They could even include the pets pack with options like taming cats and finding new owners for strays.
Nobody: 3:41 Is that a golden chicken??!!
I don't even like jam irl
Do I only obsessively play the sims for about two weeks and then not touch it again for months?  Yes. Am I going to buy this expansion pack anyways?  Yes.   Edit: Also, RAINBOW COW RAINBOW COW RAINBOW COW.
Why is no one talking about how after September 2nd you don't get the bike, gnome and lighted tree.?? Why can't these items just come with the pack all the time, EA really are trying to get us to buy this one 😐 other than that the packs looks not too bad
Still hope to see horses or maybe the ranch expansion pack where they could be available 🥲
❤👍🏻
Че? Блин, вроде загородная жизнь, а лошадей нет!
3:09  thats it
Not gonna lie, those cows look cute as heck.
Hopefully they fix the gardening bug before this pack drops. My plants are STILL reverting back to soil even after repairing. On multiple saves. With or without mods. It's honestly annoying.
amazing but where are the goats tho
Are we all going to ignore the fact they released a cottage living expansion pack without adding horses? There is a freaking lama but not horses? Why no body complains about it? Why this issue is not in the top comments???
Ah $40 this
Finally Lamas
Omg 😍😍
This looks GREAT for the Decades Challenge as you can take away the fridge always being stocked and live off of your own food for real
So they're adding fox burglars before they actually add burglars, which were in the base game of every other Sims game? Okay
3:09 they knew
oh no not again another pack that i don't want that's 4 in a row now.
If anyone is interested in canning but doesn't want to buy the pack icemunmun has a canning mod. Just look it up
Thats my birthday :'( wish I can get that pack. :(
A wildlife or zoo pack with a lot of animals would be great
Can't wait to have the ＯＲＩＧＩＮＡＬ Milka milk.
When I buy this pack, I'm going to get a llama and call it Harrold.
bruh we want the sims 5
Still waiting for horses but i definitely won't look a gift horse in the mouth.
...I might start playing TS4 again..
3:08 this what and what story continues 😀
Can't believe this is a real trailer lmao
Kiedy konie będą w tej grze
Finally publishing not some shitty franchise with probably including some enjoyable gameplay!
Horses ... WHERE ARE THE HORSES ?!
this is the prettiest !!
Ummm were the hell are the  horses !?
All the Sims 4 Players who use CCs to make they're house and sims a cottage core aesthetic place: I have been summoned
im not sure if its just the team that creates EP's (expansion packs) but i really like the direction the sims seems to be heading, even the humor in this trailer is next level, the eggplant 🍆🍆💦 joke was good ;)
horse I need a horse
Класс!🥰
Ni llamas ni conejos pueden llenar el profundo agujero de mi decepción . Estos animales ni siquiera tendrán jugabilidad. A mi siempre me ha gustado recrear mis familias favoritas de los sims 3 en los sims 4, a mis sims ecuestres hace tiempo que los tengo hechos, pero a este paso nunca podré jugar con ellos porque les falta la mitad de su personalidad, y lo más importante, los caballos.
As a British person who lives in the cotswolds...the sims have created the modern village I am familiar with, including the pet rabbits.
I like it but where are horses, sheeps and PIGS?
I think this time EA read all the comments and made this pack
CAN THE LLAMAS SPIT ON SIMS 🤞
did this llama really say that or am i going coocoo
I can’t wait for this pack!!
You forgot to mention the bunnies.
うわーっ！！！！ほしい！！！ はやく遊びたい〜😆💕💕
And now EA: Do this is Sims 3 for us grown ups. Or make a Sims 5, with everything that's good with 3 AND 4 without making it look like a cartoon for children and pump up the game feel!
my sims game doesn’t have sound and EA support couldn’t manage to make me fix it but i’m still cautiously excited for this pack. maybe the base game update will even fix my sound issue 🤔
This should be a game pack… there’s not enough gameplay for it to be a expansion pack in my eyes.
Yes yes yesss
greedy developers
Comments a new
This is so cute! The animals, canning, stitching, the ponds yes 🥰 just yes 🥰
Only preordering because of Harold, the llama
Omg I cant wait EA. Dont disappoint me this time
Will there be horses, sheep, pigs and goats? That’s all thats missing from this pack other than that this is perfect
the sims 4 stardew valley expansion pack
im cautious of hom excited to be but im literally grinning from ear to ear so idk
I wish the llamas had been in the more thematically appropriate Jungle Adventure. At least let people make residential lots in Selvadorada so I can have a little mountain llama farm!
It bugs me that the milk isn’t landing in the bucket. I know, such a slight detail but nonetheless. I’m hoping it doesn’t break console saves. Every other pack (only certain consoles were/are affected, I had the worst luck with the xbox1 s, not so much trouble with the Xbox series x tho) breaks my save files. (I know how to fix and avoid error code 22, that’s not what I’m talking bout when I say “breaks saves”). & console doesn’t have the options of mods either. (I play it on both console & pc) . Okay- end of slight jumbled rant lol.
I'm liking the CAS items.
I love this video and this game in general  But has anyone else not been able to login into there origin accounts after the summer event thing?
Im literally dien I WAN T THIS RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS SOOO COOL EE✨
We Stan Harold
Adorable! I only wish there were pigs, but we can't have it all!
the fox sneaking in gave me flashbacks to el bandito pls
" Sexual themes " ....What?!
OMGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i am SOOOOO excited for this pack definitely my favorite one so far
I want horses. I want sheep. I want goats. 😫
Sims meets harvest moon
This is the first expansion pack I have been excited for in a while!
Do a gymnastics theme one
The Grim huggin llama looked sweet...
welp my laptop is smoking. ima need a gaming pc.
How is this a gameplay trailer???
Better late than never on that “Simple Living” lot trait. The endless food in the fridge and charging every time has always peeved me.
Woah this is actually relevant and lit
7 odd years and still no DLC with horses, this would have been the perfect one to have horses on ;-;. Still looks super cute though
MissGerbit, este sería un pequeño guiño para ti que me imagino te hubiera encantado! 🙌
now.... I can make shrek more realistic in sims 4😩
Why am I crying
This pack will mark the return of LGR.
Please give us more information about the adorable bunnies <3
I’m just hoping for new voices for the Kids 🥲
damm this one actually looks good.
Sims, WHEN WILL WE GET HORSES???
so [still] no free standing pillows? c'mon Maxis...  this pack looks fantastic though 💛
avoid pre purchase guys, you will face glitches and bugs and very boring gameplay, and the sims team won't fix or update it.  at least some bugs get corrected after 1 month.
why some black hole - a burrow as a cowshed? You couldn't give a solution like in a game like the zoo planet? so that the animals can be seen as they go to sleep. Nonsense black hole ... I was counting on a cowshed in which you can still see your pet sleeping ......... is the llama and cow sleeping animation such a difficulty for you?
I have a question can you guys make the packs on pa4 a bit cheaper like come on $53.49 like what do u think I’m made of money I could feed my whole family for that much seriously
Players : We want horses !   EA : Here are your lama and your Skittles making cow
Okay, so... The eggplant part, anyone? xD
I think i saw a beef wellington there and i dont know how feel about that with the Option to have Cows.
yes yes yes!
I'm sad my PC is broken I cant play this
I NEED TO RUN A LLAMA FARM IN TS4
Why no horses? Why? This pack looks amazing but my heart is broken because they just had to leave something out that we had before.
And animals!!!!!
I'll be cooking and gardening and fishing to my hearts content
Ok we already have cottage living soooooo....... When the Sims 5
WHY IS NOOME FREAKING OUT ABOUT ANIMALS!!! LIKE- OMG A CHICKENNN.
0:40 Our favorite love hater!  Mrs. Agnes CrumpleBottom!   ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
A yes another dlc good
It'd be really cool if sims had accents based on the worlds they live in.
Kto polska? A tak wogóle wreszcie się doczekałam tego dodatku
You had me at talking llama ❤️
I’ve never been so excited for a pack in my life!
does the cow move from that one spot? like, free walking? i noticed it was always kind of in the same spot lol
this pack is the ultimate wlw fantasy
I have literally no money to spend on any sims pick, why am I watching this?
IAM SCREAMING OMGG AAAAAAAAAA
Will cows and llamas be more than animated furniture?
cottage living irl: virtual cottage living: *_OMG SO FUN_* 😍😍👌😊😁😁
Bring out Sims 5 you cowards
They need to chill with the prices, £35!!! That’s a weeks food shop. Ridiculous.
Im glad they arent doing Sims 5 and instead keep building on Sims 4
Put the sims 3 on chromebook
Why this video has warning for sexual content
Best pack EA has done in a while
Sims 4 stardew valley expansion
Yeah still passing. As cute as the trailer is. You arent giving much that isnt already provided by the other packs, and pretty much nothing i want in my game. To be honest i was hoping for the werewolf pack you teased us with a few months ago.
I been waiting for the sims to have more animals
Man one thing I wish is for you guys to be genuine (unless it's EA doing this)about your prices. I go to see the prices of the stuff packs to get a couple but they went up to $10 when they used to be $5. So now I only can get one. I would so buy much more if the prices were actually fair😟 It might be EA but if not I would like the prices to at least go back to where they were. I love the new expansion pack but I know for the moment I'm not going to be able to get it because of how much it is aaaaaahhhhhh🙃
Can you please put horses in the game?
Im only here for the chickens.
wait. did I just see a pond?
Where The horses😭😭😭😭
This actually looks like a good pack... I wish every other sims 4 back looked this good
Wait no rabbits? 🥺
OMG this is amazing!!
AHHHHHH I LOVEEE ITTT
Yet they can't add horses
Can you make the sims 4 open world so we can have cars already...
But- where are the fairys, werewolves..? :(
If this pack is as good as laundry day I’ll be very chuffed.
It feels like the graphical fidelity Is decreasing. Apart from the Sims themselves, this looks like a PS2 game.
Looks like i wont be eating for 4 months again
I LOVE IT!!
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THE CHILD COOKING!?!?
I've been calling this for years but I was always been shut down by the sims community, whose laughing now huh?! Huh!?
Yay more DLCs!!
IM SO EXCITED
Ah yes it's the Ireland pack
I wonder if the makers behind the mods actually get something from EA stealing their ideas... Like icemunmun for example. I love her chicken coop and canning station, so I really hope she gets something from it.
This is what Americans think British people live like haha
So .. digging with filling of water finally?
All I can think about is the terrible graphics... Like, what happened here?
They're targeting A Specific Generation (Gen Z)
2:23 WHY ISNT ANYONE TALKING ABOUT THE FUCKIN DUCKS THEIR SO CUUUTE
This looks awesome!!!!!! I love the uuuhhhh what’s it called. The embroidery! And the jam! The pie 😍 the cows! This looks great. The llama is definitely dirty minded.
/motherboard
Лошадь где
i really just want the cows tbh
This better not disappoint 😂 im so excited
Why does this feel violently suspicious?
Simmers! We've come full-circle from the Llama Topiary in the Sims 1 to a real-life Llama in the Sims 4. This is awesome!
cant wait for it
I love this but everybody's gonna continue to think that cows make milk by magic and in reality they need to have a baby so we can steal the milk
WANT IT NOW
Oh god, this looks like all the stuff I've missed in TS4. I don't wanna get back into this damn game, arrrgh
I watch this like 3 times a day
This looks so fun! I love the little baby chicks, can't wait to get farmin <3
the town looks like shere in surrey. i hate it
Really appreciate this very transparent trailer, it lays everything out nicely. Thank you! I’m excited for this pack :)
0:25 wtf the cutest guy ever! What happened to EA?
When will Legacy edition players be abe to get the latest expansion packs?
Now I can live my stardew valley life once again in the sims lmao
Some harvest moon fomt vibes lol love it
I love the idea but Sims 4 has such a horrorfull, tacky grafic, I stay with Sims 3
Next time I would like Snoop dogg as the narrator please 💕💕🤣🤣
Where are horses? Many players have long wanted to build their own equestrian club, but ... Okay, we do not lose hope, probably
Wait did i see a lake/pond tool?!
So cows can’t have babies
I am a Chinese player, EA company's inaction is really very bad, in your battlefield 1 game, a player of Hollan42 unscrupulously opens the plug-in（hacker）, but you don't do it, as a game company, this is your way? It's a terrible company that only sells games, not after sales
Wow, Sims finally caught up with Minecraft.
yup....i’m getting this for my birthday
I pre-ordered this pack! I can't wait!
Omg yaasssss
Как только вышло дополнение ферма с patreon , разработчики сразу спохватились  и начали выпускать нормальные дополнения , только так до них доходит , что нужно выпускать качественный контент, по-другому не понимают
Looks very charming. May have to give it a go.
Do u NEED cats and dogs to buy it not just for it to work with the pets? Cuz I’m on Xbox and can’t get cats and dogs.
The only thing I can think of that would've mad this pack an absolute must-buy, would've been if horses were added. Kinda sad they weren't, because I feel like with the addition of cows, horses don't seem too far-fetched. BUT this is good, this is really great!
So it comes out July 22nd...but I have to wait until Sept 2 to buy it to get bonus stuff?
Okay but will sims have British accents?
The graphics are shockingly lazy and look very dated. EA you’ve lost your spark. You care more for money than your fans
tbh i just cant wait to get bunnies in the sims! i love bunnies to much lmao
is it just my game that's been doing this, its done it to 2 of my sims family's but when my sim travels to a festival or anywhere in the snowy escape world it brings me to manage worlds then i got to play them again and go to where they are and it takes me to manage worlds again and idk how to fix it but that juts keeps happening and its really annoying cuz I cant play with those sims.
I’m dumb with preordering but- if you preorder does it come straight away? Or does it come when it’s been released? O,o
The sense of humor... 😂
Where are horses? TT
What the animals die too?!
Theee kid can have a cooking skilll?!!! Wooow
Would any of them animals 💩
Lmao-
I wanted to recreate the house of babe the brave pig and made the sim granny and all but THERE IS NOT PIGS I'm super dissapointing
How to pay bills in new update!?
Wait I actually really like this one
3:09 I can't believe that was said in an official Sims trailer. And it's not even...wrong to say.
RAINBOW COWS!!! RAINBOW COWSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All I can picture is David Mitchell. I could swear that's him voicing Harold.
I CANT WAIT
I want a demon chicken in every household of mine from now on
PLEASE add horses 🥲🥲🥲🙏🏻
I enjoy the video but there's things they come have left out! I'm tired of people trying to push their way of living on everyone to be like them.
"There's over 34 designs" So... 35 then?
Give us sims 5 already
I want it .. NOW ! 😭 Can't wait to play this Gamepack 🥰
Omg give it to meeeeee, the trailer is fantastic, I have 30 chickens and now in Sims I can have some too, I'm in love xD
De Sims 4 Familie van Zanten,Linda Wagenmakers,Stanley Burleson,Familie La Bouff en Charlize Theron Landelijk Leven.
it’s released just a cottagecore pack
I'm still 🤨... I bet the map is tiny or the most stuff we can see in the trailer ain't possible
i am so excited for this! as someone who has grown up in the middle of nowhere, england, this pack looks amazing and so homey to me. cant wait to get my hands on it!
Are we really gonna ignore what harold said at 3:09 ? I'm still pikachu shocked here.
I don't see any horses. Imma head out.
That cherry dress tho🥺
Alright, I need it
I own all the packs..need this one now.
I AM SO FREAKING EXCITED!!!
probably...
This actually looks good.
This is now my favorite gameplay trailer now. And this llama is my favorite narrator
Anyone else already start building lots ready for farms ?
Muito fofo, só podia estar mais barato aqui no Brasil
3:10 “Dont fly the coop just yet, this cluck and bull story continues y'all” In case anyone was wondering what Harold was saying
POND ??
What about rabbit !?
Beef Wellington????? I see a Hells Kitchen lot in my future!!
Want to ride a llama!!!
Hopefully I am alive by the time The Sims 5 is released.
Don't be shy release it early!
I'm excited to watch my favorite YT Simmers take this pack and turn it into an LP.
Horses ? and Cars?
soooo… no horses ?
So we can now live in Midsomer, when do the murders start?
This is the pack I’ve been dreaming of
OMG! I haven't touched Sims 4 in probably 2 years, but this is probably the one and only pack that could get me back into the game. This looks so good!
The Lamma dlc looks amazing
what happened to the rabbits?
I hope this is as cool as it looks!
not another bar
Sims 5 is coming. This is it. Anyone else get “farewell” vibes?? And it comes out the day of their gaming conference where they’re supposed to announce something “Big” and in the Summer of Sims announcement on their Instagram they mention something odd with a very vague description… we got the packs.. we had the live event.. now? OUF
honestly, even if I hated the gameplay I would still get this just for the world. lol
The EA A.I has become self-aware, send help
Can you make so you can have more family members like 15
Ok, the different flavors of milk part made me smile..lol This looks like fun, it would definitely give me a reason to enjoy gardening again..
This…actually doesn’t look terrible
bruh I just want the bunnies
All I want is that angry chicken. It just looks so amazing please
Can't wait
Im sooo excited for this!!
So keen for this
Man I have paid over a grand to EA for their "Gameplay" trailer to have a disclaimer that not all images appear in game Imao
this looks so good but I wish they added horses😭😭
So excited for this pack!!
This...looks amazing! 🤩
I can’t wait
I've been waiting for this for weeks I cannot wait for this pack!!!
Very disappointing the bunnies are just sims pleasing slaves that bring them luck for farming or some gifts... not just actual pets but slaves... sad... I really wanted actual pet bunnies in the game
im crying
My mind after seeing the talking llama: "My tummy was making the rumblies only hands can satisfy" *ONLY OG'S KNOW* lmao
Why are people so excited about this expansion pa- OH MY GOD THEY HAVE CHICKENS AND RABBITS
This looks like the greatest Sims 4 pack since Seasons.
Sim2 remake
SO excited! My chickens will finally MOVE! edit: WOW...I can't believe how toxic this community is. I thought Dead by Daylight was bad...
I cant wait omg
Simmers: can we have a different narrator for the gameplay videos? EA: yeah! Here’s a llama lol
¡Es la llama que llama! ¡Contestenle!
This was definitely the best Sims trailer I’ve ever seen. 😍
yoooo this is showing promise I like it!
llamas and rabbits have been the theme for a while now so it’s about time they actually appear
Britains finally being represented haha Just seeing the food got me excited! Crumpets! Beef Wellington! Shephards Pie! Toad in the Hole!! 2:16
AGHHH IM SO EXITED
So  an we have egg without mods now?? Pancakes too??
too much inspired by story of seasons..even the festival
Wow, I might just have to redownload the Sims 4. First pack in forever that seems interesting.
This looks amazing!! I can't wait
CHERRY DRESS
Kids can cook?! :D
Emmm... This is Polish Sims YT. Why all write in English?
OMG DID I HEAR A SIMS 1 EMERGENCY SOUND EFFECT FOR THE FOX?
I pre ordered it June 22nd and I cannot wait to play thissss
3:08
Its all I ever dreamed off
Como puedo descargarlo
3:25 swiper, no swiping!
finally, the farming sim for the end times i've been waiting for
so I assume the clip of the toddler playing in the pond was just a clip from something else. I don't think they can actually do that. They are really hyping this up. I doubt the cows, llamas or chickens are any different from cats and dogs.
I can't wait to get this look so fun with the baby chick's there so cute
at 46 seconds there is a new toddler hair
POND TOOL 😍
Id like to know who voiced the Llama
Can't wait omg!!
AHHHHHHH THIS LOOKS AMAZING
new harvest moon series look so good
Just that? For 40$ im so sick of this... There are so much simple stuff that you could have to this pack, stuff that already existed in sims 3 which means you should be familiar with it and how you can make it, also the world literally looks like GT's world nothing new AND give us grocery store stuff for gods sake Edit: NO BREEDING!!!! atleast give us the opportunity to breed just one little animal and when one of the parents naturally dies we can breed one again
FINALLY PONDS AND ANIMALS 🤯🤯🤯 in the sims 4
Why is nobody talking about how they built a lake, like we get water tools now?!!!
What an absolute unit, Harold the Liama.
THE BABY CHICKS OMG I'M MELTING!! AND ALSO WE HAVE SWAN?!
A POND A POND finally
3:26 is it a way to say robbers are back ? 👀👀
Throw a glass jar into a boiling pot... makes sense
Am I the only one who has noticed the light pink hair color, I'm confused😅 0:25 or is that just a blond swatch
Cottagecore itself
can you guys fix the cc chairs not working 🧐
I'm getting stardew valley vibes over here...
So Stardew Valley DLC? Love it!
So I have never bought an sims pack before and I just got 60 dollars from babysitting (it was a weekly payment) and I thought what the heck and then I saw this pack and I was like I have to preorder this, and it has been on my mind ever since.
Yay more overpriced meh
I have never been so excited for a sims DLC as much as I am for this one.
There is always beautiful buildings in trailer but not in the game...why?
Haven't been so excited about a Sims pack in years <3
This feels like Stardew Valley 🤩🤩🤩
i'an not the bigest fan of sims 4 but this pack just might make me buy it
That's it soooo beautiful!!!!!!
The voice over was really annoying
Can't we just say "Swiper no Swiping"
The lama dissing the cow is hilarious
y'all are really going to give us a fox burglar before actual burglars, huh?  idk....looks good, won't get to optimistic though. Eco living looked great too...
This looks amazing! I am very excited 😁
WOWWW AHH
HORSES ??!
This game has become nothing but a money pit... Sims 3 and Sims pets on ps3 and 360 was far better than Sims 4 and wasn't nothing but a money pit with. Sims 4 the game basically was gutted at the start just to get more money out of the game and call it DLC... I will never buy or play Sims again let alone a game from EA period.... Thanks for ruining it with being money hungry.
The script is good, the voice over actor's voice doesn't match the nuance of the script. Maybe they should've just used a game changer from the UK to record the narration. Plumbella would've been a good choice. So, this pack will hopefully satisfy the whole farming crowd, though I doubt it because simmers will always find a reason to complain.
Will there be a farmer career? If so will any of the university degrees help with this? If they do, what ones will help?
I love this oack already and The bonus content 👌
So cows and llamas are like babies? Objects???? I mean still happy tho
Great job on the trailer, one of your best if not THE best trailer in years.
Ponds are finally here !
So all of the new animals are objects, right? They're all permanently attached to the rabbhithole objects we see here, similarly to babies, correct?? Meaning if I wanted to have a herd of cattle, I'd need at least like 7+ animal sheds to get the illusion that I have fully fleshed out cows in my game, because only one animal has been depicted next to the animal shed at a time unlike the chicken coop. Just making sure I'm understanding this correctly. This just seems like a rehash of the Sims 3 Milkin’ it Dairy Coral to be completely honest with you.
I'm SO excited, you finally did it! Can't wait ♡
I wish they had bee keepers & hives
Wicked whims update for this gonna be lit
And.. what about the rabbits?  Update: found out rabbits can't be pets!  Please change this!  Many people have rabbits as pets and I would love to have a rabbit as a pet instead of them just being wild with domesticated colors.   This is so disappointing.. I'm not buying.
I hate Origin it’s really strange!Pleeease do something else but not Origin
Wait... the foxes steal eggs? What kind of bullshit is that? Foxes steal chickens
Is this how Americans think Brittish people talk?
Waiting for a Secret Spy or Super hero expansion
I’m buying this stop playin
If there aren't a thousand glitches & sims actually route properly.........this has the potential to be amazing.  Cautiously optimistic
I'm shocked 🙀
Are those dreads I see
eikö yhtään suomalaisia kommentoijia, olenko ainoa?
I'm just so excited to play this!
I havent been so excited about something in such a long time
Sooo.... Stardew Valley update?
This looks so cute I'm very excited
Soooo canning and the food, chicken coop and even the cow and the thing with the fridge are all existing functioning mods by icemunmun and the srsly’s cooking overhaul mod...
They should rebrand it as SimFarm, not The Sims 4
Wouldn’t it be cool if you also have the cats and dogs pack the dog could guard the chickens from the fox
Where are horses?😭
The Sims 4 but Stardew Valley
Anne with an E vibes    🥰
So cute and interesting
2:37 why...
Ik heb hem al gepre-orderd!!!!!!
Cow-plant Jam, Yummy? Bird-nest Jam, is that a forage item? I hope the gazebo @ 0:33 is a buy/place item. I think that is new buy/place water/wishing-well @ 2:23, I like it! I like the tractor tire planting pot @ 0:34, and is a potting bench and gardening shed? Honeybee Window!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @ 1:01  HEY! Cool! They make a inglenook fireplace @ 1:18, but I was hoping for Parlor Stoves. I hope we get a Parlor Stoves kit. I hope we can warm ourselves at those stoves. I don’t know their name but they stay on 24/7 to warm the house, water or something.  In the first Cottage Living trailer, I can see stone retaining walls used in the village, I sure hope that is a new land scaping tool for us.
Omg finally
I love himm
Lets just hope that this pack is actually worth its asking price, i'm normally a pessimist when it comes to sims 4 dlc but i'm optimistic about this pack as it seems to actually have a decent amount of content and gameplay that also appears to be of good quality, i'm just hoping that the legend known as LGR reviews this pack as the guy makes great reviews and speaks honestly about these packs.
I am suer excited yet worried lol, this is gonna make for a bomb gameplay! cant wait
I haven't touched my  Sims 4 game  for about a year, but this just peaked my interest to play again possibly. Lol
0:40 Forget the animals, the absolute queen Mrs. CrumpleBottom is making her return to pester our Sims. xD Haven't seen that old hag since Hot Date.
I love Harold 💚💚💚
That shot of the grim reaper hugging the llama. 🥺 My heart!
all the british foods are making me so happy. look at that low poly yorkshire pudding. yes i WILL make my sims eat this constantly and feel weirdly emotional about it thank you for asking
I AM MOST EXCITED FOR THE LLAMAS OMG
Now I need a mod who introduce in The Sims a stardew valley items in game
2:17 What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you see that beef wellington on display?
Why is this the best expansion? 🤩🤩🤩
OMG CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY IT!!!!
Ponds? What?
Swiper no swiping. Swiper no swiping
Where did the sims 5 go?
Yes oh my god yes!!!!!!
I preordered it I can’t wait 😝 this is prob gonna be my fav pack in game wow 🤩
I'm in love ~
Sold! Horses next?
🔥🤩
Looking forward to this. Very interesting pack, I love this idea, and I think people have been wanting to have a farm sort of life in the Sims for quite some time. I'm very intrigued.
Berty Botts Beans for the Cow........WOW!
I can't wait... for Kevin to play this one, haha
It's weird Harold doesn't speak Sims language
where are the horses?
I hope we can at least Download Harold's Family, even if we can't get Harold, Himself.
The trailer: 😱🤩🥰 The gameplay: 🥱🤔😴
Horse? 😪 [*]
When I wanted a farm pack this isn't what I meant but ok
How can you play this game? I would choose bankruptcy or this game
Ok, but apparently you can't have more cow's, like in the sims 3 with the horses: a barn and then you add as many as you want and even breed them! You only can have one barn per animal and in front you have your cow, when you want more you have to add every time a new barn and you can't breed them to have babies! pretty lam! Not worth the money! And what when you don't have enough space to place such a barn???
Swans??
So excited about this! I love playing sims as ‘off grid’ and now this gives so many more options!!!
I hope in this one they fixed the issue with bugs where you had to constantly entertain them. Otherwise, i`m not gonna spend hours stuck in animation loop - cows and llamas won't be living for long,byeeeee
good guide... i guess...?
3:09   Wait-
3:25 Swiper :D
All of this for the modest price of... 40€ ! The price of a full game, just for basic, non revolutionary gameplay. Thank's EA Games !
Finally a farm
Why you do not dubbing the trailers anymore with local languages?
ARE WE JUST IGNORING THE POND THEY MADE AT 2:40 ? WILL THERE BE ANOTHER TERRAFOMING UPDATE???
Finally, this game is now better than before
I have never been so excited in my life
Ok, I love this pack, but cows don't just give milk, they need to have a baby for that. How are we getting eggs and baby chicks, but forgo biology with cows?
You can make jam with a cloth top, I want this expansion pack because it’s literally my fantasy
This will be the BEST pack
Wow there's black hole in the shed
I have never been more excited for an expansion. I even downloaded an app to countdown the days, JULY 22 COME QUICKER PLEASE
Im dying miss crumple bottommmmmm
omg
I  N E E D  T H I S
I am...cautiously optimistic
so.. does dat mean.. icemunmun's canning station.. chicken coop.. n cows will b obsolete??
This is the absolute best pack after snowy escape
I can just say.... aaaaaaa! I wasnt into this, but now i am, fully!
Cant wait🥺🥺
Literally cannot wait for this!!!
Omg I've been waited years for this pack in the sims 4. I miss the horses, but everything I wanted is here ❤
I can finally live my hobbit fantasy in the sims
This does feel like a GP... World + 2 interesting objects (cow/llama shed + chicken coop). Feels like a third of gameplay is missing, like having a horse range with an in-world track to ride/race horses. And like a tractor to tend a large field. That would have completed the farm theme for me.  And they're literally just rubbing it in with the fox alarm and music when we don't have burglars....
Can't wait 😍😍😍😍
Wait, wait.... WE CAN BUILD ACTUAL PONDS NOW?  Like, we don't have to disguise the edges of pools or fountains with rocks and grass anymore?
3:09 are we just gonna ignore what he said there or...?
WOW!!! I'm fascinated by this!
EA cycle once again
Are you going to fix the glitch with Snowy Escape? Still cannot go on a mountain excretion :(
actually a pack worth its price??
hello The sims, I love this game, and after years of playing with it I wish there were horses, it would be great
Lo temgo reservado desde el 20 de junio🥰
This is worth it simply for the English food 😌
"Let's assume you made the horrible mistake of choosing cow." the nerve lmao
1:30 The Ponds is Back!
SOOO EXCITING! I am ready.
Wait… is that Mrs Crumplebottom?! 0:40 LORE!?
I’ve never seen anything more British but also more relatable to where I live! Yay!!!!!!!
Iam so ready. Cant wait ❤️
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I was NOT expecting a llama death in this trailer i am traumatized
Is Ea Making The Sims 4 Better Now?
So we don’t get thieves but we got swiper no swiping lmao okay
omg PONDS
I need this already lol
Ok EA now horses please
i love the sims ,and i hope to play this newgames
THIS IS NOICE
Give us a supernatural expansion pack or  showtime expansion pack pleaseeeeee. I want to be able to transform into an actual werewolf or perform in a concert
As soon as this release. I am legit finally going to be able to own a llama without my family telling me no. Thank you, Sims, 4.
My daughter grew on The Sims 3 and all its' packs. The gameplay helped her express herself in ways I couldn't have imagined. it would be so nice to have a new pack in Sims 4! Always refreshing! 💜
how muchhh
i- yes
I SAW A POND MADE FRO TERRAIN TOOL!!!
0:24 RABBITS!! KRÓLIK!
swiper no swiping!! swiper no swiping!!
Крууууууть!!!!👍👍👍👍👍👍
What about horses? Were adding horse riding animations too hard ☠?
What did that llama just say 3:09
0:59 I like the fact that they actually open the jar, it’s the little things for me
This looks the best pack ever
haha cook and bull torture
one of my sims would be perfect for this lifestyle so sims im praying you dont disappoint me
Why no horses😭 there were files for them in the game…🥺  Expansion pack looks great tho!
I’m suspicious 🧐
When the chicken coop has a more pleasing folk gothic gingerbread theme than we can even build in build mode. Lol
Not bad not bad
i just love the VO
the sims community: can we please have gameplay trailers that aren’t just YA women narrating? ea: you bet. here’s a llama
I know this is minor but I was hoping for a butterchurn.
As someone whose favorite animal is llama, you have my complete and undivided attention
3:09
lo único que no me gusta es que en español llamaron a Henford on bagley como Villa Gallina... o sea super cagado XDDD
The narration felt like a family-friendly version of Peep Show.
Wait, can we adopt the fox into our household???
И опять нельзя будет играть от лица животных, моды качать?
Oh god the grim reaper hugging the llama 😭😭😭😭
No corn🌽?
if we want to have more than 1 animal we will have to have more than 1 stable this is ridiculous
This gameplay trailer is so "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous with Robin Leach", and I am loving it.  :P
Yay😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆👏👏👏👏
ye ok harold i love you-
yo why is this the BEST sims trailer i have EVER seen
This look so fun! I only have complaint with the picnic basket part. The way they handle the animation is so lazy. Can't they at least have a sim use their hand to open the lid
This Will be my favorite pack
Oh you don’t have enough money to buy this type of house? Just play it as a video game.
Wait, D-did EA just… MAKE SOMETHING GOOD!!!!
all look so nice nice nice omg i to buy it nowwwwww in sims 4 omg
When they had the foxes as a little burglars I just thought “swiper no swiping!”
I’m so excited!! Already pre-ordered it!
Sims give it to me for freee eeee lol 😂
I love the fact that you can cross stitch because I, in real life, love cross stitching.
why is there so many dirty jokes in this one video😭😭
everyone SHUT UP! now, let me buy this pack.
IS THAT MISS CRUMPLEBOTTON
I’m not trying to complain but it’s just funny that they make the fox sounds like a burglar 😂
Horses. Horses were sooooo good in Sims 3. How hard was it to include horses in this expansion pack? Knowing EA, we'll probably have to pay for horses to be in the game in a separate Pack. I hate it here.
Love the pack!!! There Is one thing missing for a farm animal is a horse please do a pack with horses.
This is all great. but THERE'S THE HORSE???
They got Swiper The Fox in here???? Let’s go!!
I would die for Harold the Llama
Wow. Amazing.
I can't get past "garden to tabes" ... 🤦🤦🤦
I love the diversity shown with the various sims and families!
wowTHANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO THE COMMUNITY even tho I did not ask for a farm pack for the longest time watching this now I sure am buying this!
Theory: thief fox is a hint for burglars in the future
Can you slaughter the animals?
harold.... theyre lesbians
Dr. Gluon as a Chicken is love! LOL
WOW 😍😍😍😍
Ngl I wasn’t even mildly interested for this, until the Llama narrated, now I’m cautiously excited (But it’s coming from EA so I’ll play for 2 days if I get it then get bored)
Am I the only one that noticed Agnes Crumplebottom
3:23 Drgluon finally gets a fez in Sims
lol xd random llama omg epic baconz
Só faltou cavalo 🏇
I love being able to play with animals now! But in my game I'd only treat them with love like they deserve and not drink their milk, nor eat their eggs, etc.
Omg Drgluon is getting his wish of a Fez in the game
Please be good PLEASE BE GOOD
Harold sounds like he’s impersonating Richard Ayoade
I'm so excited for this.  Farm to table and RABBITS dghshagahh I'm so happy, I really hope that they depict them accurately where they implement them more like cats/dogs than as barn animals and with create a sim customization, I NEED my babies to be living cozy in my dream house.   I also hope that they don't portray domesticated rabbits as wild rabbits because the trailer only showed domestic bunnies and they were all outside.
😻🔥🔥💖
i like the part when the black person was growing crops just like they're meant to, can't wait to do the same to the 2 other black families in the game
KIDS CAN COOK!?!
i never understood the demand for farming in the sims (except for chickens, which are not uncommon in backyards in north qld), but this looks really good. i don't play sims 4 anymore bc i get bored after an hour or so, but small village family-life is right up my alley. i'm cautiously optimistic, i'll wait to see if the inevitable bugs (bc ea seem to be allergic to playtesting) make it completely unplayable, but this might be the first pack i buy at full price in years 🤔
EA, please compare and contrast the like to dislike ratio on this vs Batuu. Learn from that. We're here because we know how great this franchise can be. Don't abuse that.
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
the sims community: can we please have gameplay trailers that aren’t just YA women narrating? ea: you bet. here’s a llama
This looks so amazing! 🤩
I ask you for a minute of your time to help me fulfill my dream of being an artist for the short time I have left in life I have cancer and I am disabled without friends why I cannot leave my house because of the bullying that they do to me why I was not lucky enough to have a good physique but I love myself as I am because that was what I got blessings and God bless you all
SWIPER?!
Now if I could only get mods to work😣
The one pack we all agree on that’s gonna be worth our money
Anyways, Join Team Cows!!!!
It would be cool if cowplants and cows could have some kinda interaction together
I'm preordering this today :)
I love that The Sims 2: University Cow and Llama rivalry lives on within The Sims 4: Cottage Living
Dnt lik the animal shed, wish there was a pen so i could make a barn but at least we get animals
Well done sims team <3
More trailers like this please. Informative and not trying so hard to sound young and hip.
What, is Mrs. Crumplebottom gonna come back?? 0:39 And kids can cook now?? Kinda hopeful for this And I can't wait to see how CallMeKevin will manage to chaos chaos in this quiet little town lol
I'm genuinely interested to see the interactions we can have with the cows/sheep. I LOVE that they can be dressed up and shown off. I wonder if the town fair/market is a pop up event or if it is available to schedule on the calendar.  Overall, these 4 minutes made me super excited for this new pack, I have high hopes.  Plus, i'm a sucker for any pack involving new animals/ minimalistic living
THE POND TOOL RETURNS 😭
F I N A L L Y llamas
wow!!! it's the first time that the sims added a lot of different kinds of animals that you can interact with <3 <3 <3
OMG OMG OMG OMG I'm going to convince my mum to buy me this for my birthday at September. Luckily the bonus content ends on my bday (sept 3) for Australia
1:22 いかついおっさんがクロスステッチしてんの可愛い
Im sorry but woohooing in a barn for animals thats DISGUSTING
The world looks gorgeous -- I have a couple of Sims that would probably like to live there if given the chance. :) And the lot challenges intrigue too. I'm looking forward to finding out more!
Im really excited I already pre ordered it  with this pack i can finally simulate my real life. Now all I want is a color wheel for hair (we have no purple shades but two pink and two blues 😩) and to be able to change Sims heights
I have never been so excited for a sims pack!
So you're telling me we get burglar alarms for chickens but not sims 🥺
The fact that Harold has a very rural British accent makes me even more excited
I've never felt more uncomfortable than I did hearing a British Llama say y'all.
I love this, but can you update so we can have horses too? :)
cute!
would they dress the fox as a burglar when they KNOW we want them back if it wasnt a hint? i would love to have it as a lot challenge. i mean not every "storyline" i make fits burglars but i REALLY want the option ;-;
whatt i wanna this pack so badly and naming my chicken ramboo!!
yasssssss I can't wait
You get a Sims 3 Store Content. You get a Sims 3 Store Content. Everyone gets a refurbished Sims 3 Store Content.
When it says "not all images appear in-game" what exactly is it referring to? Are we seeing things that won't be included in the pack?
I’m sorry is that the demon chicken from fable? 😂
EA Just.... Just..  🥴the F*
Rabbit are you there?
I preordered it! :)
Not a single dislike. Sims you finally did it.
My only question is will any of the new items produced in this expansion have any true $imolean value like Dragon Fruit or will the items produced by utterly worthless like the items in Eco Living? I never use bee hives or bug houses or make faux meat cubes because I could never sell enough of them to make a profit in retail. Am I still gonna have to rely on Dragon Fruit and a Lice Cold Freezer once Cottage Living drops, or will Milk, Eggs, Preserves, or Cross Stitch actually earn me some real $imoleans? If those items have little monetary value I'll lose interest in using them pretty quick.
They better have some sort of immortality treat like they do for the Hamsters. My blood is literally pure Irish farmer but I still ugly cry when i see the cows go. Go talk to some cows it’s free therapy and they are under appreciated.
WE CAN MAKE A POOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
EA WHERE ARE THE HORSES HOW DARE YOU
Where is the cute bunnies? :C
I Want own all Animals. Look at that cute cow 😱
오오 농장팩 농장을 원한다
🦙🦙🦙
They should’ve had Mumbo Jumbo voice this 🥸
This could probably be the best pack ever !!!
I'm gonna play this pack singing "city dweller, successful fella" lol
this pack comes out on my birthday and i'm really excited for it!!
I am...cautiously optimistic
Love Gummy Bear
i love the llama's posh voice :D
This is going to be my favourite pack! 🤩
I can't wait to replicate the Great British Bake Off.
This looks awesome!! but Bruh they have taken so much inspo from arnie it’s embarrassing
This was a different style of trailer but honestly, I really liked it! Makes me look forward to playing more than any other dlc has before! Really can’t wait for this ♥️
Please bring back burglars and generations the right way!!!
Hopefully gardening will be fixed and our crops stop turning into dirt piles. That bug popped up last year with the patch before Eco living!
I can not wait to lilsimsie renovate this entire world
Muito legal, mas as expansões no Brasil são caríssimas. Bora mudar isso aí....
I hope there was a horse there.
Can we get an online mode?🥺
Yes
2:37 NOOOOOO NOT THE GRIM REAPER CUDDLING THE LLAMA IM GONNA CRY
so exciteddddddd
It's really coooooool!!! Now we want Generations!! And much better babies!
i get the sims 3 vibes, and i love it.
“Min, profesh, the HOB” This llama is hipper than I’ll ever be
I hope they have hats for the llamas 🦙
One word "Marvelous". I'm looking forward to the expansion pack. 😍😍😍😍😍
Was that a new hair swatch it looked like a pretty pastel pink color
That Fox Rlly Said "Swiper No Swiping"
Im so happy :')
“WHEN YOUR GRAN GRAN COMES” ARE WE GETTING GRANDMAS 😆😆
This trailer was everything I needed, and more! Cannot wait for this to come out so my Sims can get their hands dirty, might even have to send the grandsims to the country for their school break. 🌿
This pack looks nice, but I’m not holding my breath. This same company released kits, this same company is being sued around the world for scamming its customers.
When the fox appeared with the old sims 2 burglar theme in the background it brought so many traumatizing memories lol
How has no one mentioned the pink/blond hair yet??? It kinda seems like there’s some more color swatches in the trailer
KIDS CAN COOK?!!
Mmmmm I waaant 🥺
So this is basically Sims 4: Britain 🇬🇧😂
why did they not add horses?
why is he british....
I'm so excited for this, oh my gosh. 😭
For once, I’m not mad at this one.
i see rabbits in this trailer and the other one, we better be able to create rabbits in CAS or ill be very disappointed and sad
Hes a lama nota girraffe?
the audacity to use the burglar sound
* Hands you an eggplant jam * ;)
I LOVE all the alliteration that was in this video. Very poetic. Big props to all those involved in the writing of the script for this! 👏👏
I cant wait to have wicked whims on my farm.
Hello Harold, I'm Carl. Can you come help me can these human corpses?
My biggest question: CAN YOU ADD THE FOX TO YOUR HOUSEHOLD?
Where are the horses 🥲
The animals so cute, i cant wait to play this expansion pack
We wish us bugfixes...
3.08 😭🙏
I NEED TO GET THIS NOW!!
A llama just told me how to play the Sims 4
Correct me if I am wrong it’s been awhile since I played sims 3 or 2 but when the Fox appeared that’s the robber theme…right?
But the big egg plants🥴🍆
When you have this beauty of a world with awesome views... they couldn't make the sims sit on the floor to have a picnic? With, you know, a nice towel and all... I would love to make a romantic picnic in a ruin. The pack seems pretty fun tho. Bunch of others nice features.
I think it's time to stop milking this game. It's been SEVEN YEARS.
Did anybody spot the strawberry dress??!!!
I'M IN LOVE YALL
3:08 THIS *WHAT*??
OMG 😂
Good time to play in the 1800's without any electronic or modern devices 😅 cant wait to see the new items.. so excited 🤩✌ i hope they have hay to sleep on 😂 and an outside wooden tub
Im sooo getting this one 🐑🐄🐮🐖🐔🐓
Harold is the star we all needed
this looks so good! i honestly forgot how much i missed having my sims go to the grocery store (like in sims 2 and 3)
Is no one gonna talking about how me can make our own ponds?!!!!!!
im just excited about the yorkshire puddings
THIS is how you do a gameplay trailer!
Wait so the new animals won’t be in our household?? More like a hamster? :(
this gives me discover university vibes i like it
How come in my game the town is never that full of sims and the townies always look like psych ward escapees.
I don't think i've ever hated a voice over so much in my life lol. The almost swear words were so... uncalled for? Also, the rapidly changing clips in the beginning are a little epilepsy inducing... maybe include a clearer warning for that next time?
Is it weird that I'm more excited about pond tools than new skills? Hahahahah
OMG
Eye spy with my little eye: Dr. Gluon chicken!!! <3
I’m not that interested in this pack but I like the direction of this trailer. I didn’t feel like a toddler watching this
Cottage core lesbians are screaming 😫
Best trailer and I'm so excited for this pack!!
I was really hoping for horses but this pack has potential 😫
I love it
They added the strawberry dress but made it sims like
I can see off the grid work really well with this pack
So will the chicken police show up to fight the fox? That would be so funny.
I want horses
I don’t think you understand this will now be the only pack I need to play the sims
Yea im excited. Looks like this pack is jam-packed 😉😂
OMG OMG EUEYGEHEHTAHSGSHSHS THE TAVERB HELLO OMG THE COOKING OMG
I CANT BELIEVE WE’RE GETTING C O W S
Okay, granny needs to retire here, she just aged up. This actually looks super fun,  I really really want a chilli cook-off lmao
Was this voice-over done by Mr. Maker? (if you know you know)
So good
We're all pumped but I'm terrified that this is gonna be shipped out, full of glitches and bugs just like DHD. I really hope they didn't make that mistake again.
“Let’s assume u made the horrible mistake of choosing cows” AHAAH
Thank you so much for bringing this to us! I know what I'm getting for my birthday now 😂
This pack is my favourite! ❤❤❤
No lie, I'm actually  excited  for this
Reminds me a bit of North Wales. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
omg i cant wait to try it on sims
Where are the freaking horses
Sims meets Harvest Moon. Perfect! ♥
I am trying not to freak out but I am freaking out
HAROLD IS LITERALLY A LEGEND.
What I miss about the sims is the CHAOS. It's all happy fun living now.
pond tool like the one from sims 3!!
Putting Agnes in this pack was the weirdest idea you've come up with since the rebranding of Olympus as The Sims 4, like, she was meant to be an obstacle, interrupt dates and hit Sims with her bag, not walk in high heels and a formal dress in mud and manure miles away from the downtown, it's like putting cheese and vanilla on a steak, you're just blanking another Sim's personality (after Broke, Dreamer, Pleasants, Goths, Calientes and Lothario) and putting their caricature just to have them in this game
Okay but what it this buy by sep 2nd to get these items thing?  The bike and the tree look beautiful but does that mean I can only get them if I wait 1.5 months to play the pack?? (Also I don't understand why they would do this, that seems.. kind of adverse to their own goals?)
Omg is Devon Bumpkin in this as a sim?! If he is that’s so cool! But damn, please someone confirm this, I’ve seen a sim that looks like him a few times throughout this video, same hair, same glasses, same facial hair lol! It looks just like him, hahah.
Yay I can be a hot peasant
I absolutely adore this gameplay trailer.  And I can't believe the sims said that 1:42 lol.  This pack looks amazing, got mine preordered!
The Sims is coming to the British side of Sims and culture. Thank you EA for coming to our side of the world.
And horses?
the only pack i’ve ever looked forward to. Can’t wait
I knew canning would be implemented sooner or later. I bet when we voted for being able to wash clothes, canning was a super close second :D  Also... That trailer was perfect. I love Harold.
We already know Rag to Riches on James' channel is going to be goodddd with that new lot challenge trait!
Awright. Ye''ve sold me - but, sims devs EA Games, please travel a little further north from our beloved neighbours in England.    The next pack should be - CROFT LIVING! Imagine, adding to this already delightful xpac, with Highland Coos and Highland Doos (wait, you've already got the Doos - or in English - Pigeons) So how's about some Wild Stags, which there are plenty in our beloved Scotland.  The mountains (or Bens as we call them) the Lakes (or Lochs as we call them) and Rivers (or Burns as we call them) are stunning.  You could call the world Glenleithen which is essentially a mix of the real village of Innerleithen and many other villages starting with the word Glen.     Croft Farming is a way of life in Scotland for many farmers.  You can find at your local pub, a Ceilidh going on (in the more Northern regions of Scotland) and let's no forget the Highland Fling (that's a dance btw, not an actual fling) You can check out the Scottish Highland Games Association for more inspiration on what we do for exercise (we literally throw trees for fun or as it is called locally - Caber Tossing)   And who can forget our Bagpipes, Haggis Neeps and Tatties, Cullen Skink (bleuch, don't tell them I said that) A full Scottish Breakfast - yep our diet is scary and our weather is real bad most of the time, raining most of the time but we make up for it in our beautiful landscapes.  The choices are endless for making new dishes.    Finally, who could forget our Scottish Highland Dress which would be great in CAS (You don't know how long I've been waiting to marry my sim self off to my fiance's sim self in a proper Bonnie Prince Charlie kilt outfit) - Neck tie, not a bow.     I can't wait for this pack, but I am also concerned with the lack of Sheep and Horses.  CROFT LIVING would be awesome to tie up those loose ends ;) Sul sul.
Everyone sleeping on the fact YOU CAN NOW MAKE ACTUAL PONDS
I love cows and that's almost all I have to say.  I can't wait for this pack, everything about it is just awesome :)
Can’t wait to see what Paralives does. I’m bored of TS4.. 😴😴😴
GIVE US FARIES
Omg canning!
Did I just see they finally added a natural POND TOOL?!
Hi Harold! You're frigging adorable! 💖
This pack actually looks really well done
Am I the only one wondering how the cows will be able to give milk? Will we impregnate them ourselves or will they arrive that way?
Am I the only one who's VERY skeptical about this pack? It looks good but I just have a feeling that this pack is just gonna be a buggy mess that your just gonna play for about an hour and then get bored of. Ima hold off on this pack and I hope many of you do the same till we see ACTUAL gameplay and not some curated bullcrap.
Et les cheveux :( ????
cool, but we still want horses :c
Aaaah i llove thiis!
I have one main question, what will the foxes in this pack do concerning the 'foxes' in pets? Will that cause an update to pets if you have them both? Like if you have  afox in pets, and then get Cottage living, will it get more of the fox traits you added in CL?
Omg I love it 😍😍
Наконец-то озеро!!!!!!не бассейн, а именно возможность сделать его. И коровы и ярмарки. Наконец-то!!!
This is like a whole other game
Swiper no swiping😝 ‘Was in my head when i saw that fox with a burglar outfit on’
Wait. Did I see a red British Telephone booth? I hope that it is in debug menu!
I’m still surprised there’s No Fairy’s in this !!!
Awesome pack! So excited for this but no horses?
I’m so excited!!
OMFG THEY BUILT INTO THE GROUND TO MAKE A POND AAAAAAAA
*can we adopt the bunnies*
God, the entire place screams 'Southern Tory Village'
I always dreamed to have a home full of foxes, i would add them to my family one by one
Can’t you just... release it a little early ;) I CANT WAIT THIS LONG! It looks AWESOME!
POND TOOL, CANNING!!!! OMG!!!! I'm a milkmaid and farmhand and NEVER expected the sims to have my job, BUT HERE IT IS???
As a Brit, any reason the Sims are serving a Yorkshire pud on it's own? Normally part of a roast! The rest of the meals looks great. My favourite, and anyone whose ever tried one is crumpets. ALL THE BUTTER ON IT!!!!
2:53 OKAY BUT THIS IS SO FRICKING CUTEEEEEEEEEE COWS EYES ARE SO PRETTY AND BIGGG AND THE CHICKS? THEY ARE TOTAL CUTE
I laughed threw the the whole thing! When does it come out on ps4?
IM GOING TO BE SO JEALOUS OF MY SIMS THEY GET TO LIVE MY DREAM COTTAGECORE   WHY AM I SCREAMING
why is no one talking about the fact that we can do a cowplant jam 😭
It has a llama, i don't even have to watch the rest of the video, take my money 💰
I love harold.
i cant wait for this pack!!!
and  still no fairies
R.I.P. my 5 Rossitas, my lil' chickens where killed by a fox😢
Excellent!! Necesito dlc de Feria parque atracciones
I can barely pet and feed my two cats in time before they escape from the house so we'll see how this goes. Jokes aside this is the most excited I've been over a sims expansion pack in the last 20 years.
EA let’s charge it the same price as the base game 😂😂 sadly that’s not even true anymore it’s more than the base game now. I swear these dlcs make no sense how much they are
when are you guys going to make a good game again
I’m so excited to turn “the HOB” into something from Midsomer Murders
why did i cry tears of joy-
To nie będzie za darmo the sims 4
Alas Charles the evil chicken have returned!
WHAT5
did they work with icemunmun when it came to the canning and cows? because the way they’re describing it, it sounds exactly like their mod.
the bulgar music made me tear a bit. I miss old the sims
Szkoda że nie ma koni
can you have multiple animals in one shed? or if we want both a cow and llama, we have to buy two sheds? .... bc that would suck.
Omg I can’t wait!!! 😍😍😍
This looks cool
From all of us British simmers, his accent is really really bad 😂 pack looks fun though!
Since it's coming in my birthday I think I should receive it as a gift, EA. I've never been SO EXCITED for a pack since Seasons came. Omg. I can't wait 22 days.
Such a cute pack. The chicks are adorable most. And really can we dig ponds?? Or is it already in the game within terrain editor??😲 I am just waiting for a farming pack forever.. Why did you announce it early like a month ago almost? You could've just announce it on July 15th so that we don't have to wait this much!! 😂🤣  A long time after Sims 4 release finally I can say "THANK YOU EA" ..
I'm gonna use this to build a cult compound complete with slave pens.
When animals can get "burglers"but sims can't. 🙄
H O R S E S!!!!!!!
I honestly don’t have enough money for the sims but i don’t care. I normally don’t buy packs as soon as they come out but i’ll make an acceptation for this
I'm actually getting teary eyed--I think this will be the best pack ever. It opens so many doors for different types of gameplay. So sad to realize the animals will age and die but I love the realism! Thank you Sims Gurus!
Wait are we actually going to be able to make ponds??
Im so excited
Наконец-то годнота.
오!!!!!
Harold Edward Styles... I already love it 💚😂
swiper no swiping
I came for the food. I am not disappointed.
Looks fun but like..what about the bunnies? I need to know more about the bunnies!
🎶 “Look at you, pink cherry dress, I Really am impressed! I love it when EA listen to what we say! Can you hear the llama’s call? We’re gonna have a ball! I love it when you ‘Su-Su,’ my way!” 🎶
I want horses!!!
Wow, this looks amazing! I've never preordered a pack before now! can't wait for the 22nd!
THIS LOOKS AMAZING
Besides the expansion pack and the content (which is absolutely amazing) the trailer is killing it!!!! Well done Sims team
OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH
WHERE ARE HORSES YOU COWARDS
I NEEED THIS PACK EA YOU REALLY DID DELIVER WITH THIS ONE
My goal is to make this town the plot of Shiki but they all live after the takeover
what about rabbits ?
I already have a family or 2 that would be perfect for this pack
Harold is the sassiest llama which makes me want to get this pack and name my llama harold
When I saw the first trailer I thought this looked more like a game pack than an expansion pack, but after seeing the gameplay trailer I can now see that this is expansion material. I love cottagecore and I am so exited to be able to have to get the ingredients for recipes instead of all the ingredients being optional to have.
So I’m guessing the llama will be the icon of the pack
I was gonna buy on release date but now I’m pre-ordering
The sims: you had my curiosity, but now you have my full attention
CANT WAIT ‼️😩😩
Oh a good trailer for once
I'm officially a fan of Harold
3:08
This is pretty much everything I wanted.
i cant wait i screamed and my mom said what the hell is rong with you and like i need this pack it looks very very very fun
This pack, Eco Lifestyle and Seasons would go beautifully together. I'm beyond excited!
if you had the abiltity to animate llamas why didnt u do horses
Cows aren’t customizable!! And we can only have one. Wtf
ONE cow? Just one?
3:09 i saw what you did there
I think we can all agree this is the best sims 4 game play trailer ever
Ahahahhaha BEGONE THOX
BEEF WELLINGTON  GORDON RAMSAY'S KITCHEN NIGHTMARES IN THE SIMS LETS GO
Who is he can we see more of him please? 0:25
I have always been a sims fan. Just never got into 4 because I couldn't justify the money on it. I wasn't bitter and still had very fond memories. Jump ahead many many many years later. I saw the first trailer for this pack. Bam I got rehooked and have been slowly buying all the other packs to catch up. This one just looked SOOOOOOO AWESOME and fun. You magic devs brought me back. Thank you
A LLAMA?!? HES SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD!!!! 😱 Yeah, weird... 😓
This is just beyond adorable omg I can't wait to play!!!
This pack might get me to play the Sims again lol.
Could we buy it on amazon?
When they call out the bottomless fridge lol
Interesting fact. Llamas don’t have teeth in the front of their top jaw. Only molars and fighting teeth in the back. They use their bottom front teeth like a shovel and scoop up grass as they graze. Harold here, has apparently stolen someone’s dentures lol
It's really nice but I probably won't buy unless it includes fairies somehow lol
Wow
I can’t wait till this pack comes out I’ve never been so excited for a pack! I’ll be buying it ASAP!
Ohhh hurry up EA!!!!
I’m just here for the llama
0:26 am I dreaming or is that a pastel pink hair color
EA Game's a quebradora de tabus 👁👄👁
The Hob, Reminds me a lot of the hobbit's shire in LOTR
The animals look's so cuteeee! Cow especially 🥺
WHY NO HORSES
Harold the llama has my heart
the PONDS 😳💀
i am an embarrassing level of excited for this
Whoa., nice town and can't wait to live in the country side
The first pack I’ve been excited about in a long time looks really cozy and fun.
I’m excited about the pack but kinda wish they would’ve put cross stitching in the knitting pack… room for something else. Other than that exciting!
harold sounds like mr collins from pride & prejudice lol
I'm pretty excited for this one!
he protecc he attacc but most importantly, he spit on snacc
Omg, so excited! And love the voice actor🤣
🍆 🍆  👁👄👁
But how are bugs going to ruin the gameplay? That’s what we really want to know
This is my pack my asthetic is cottage core I am so frikin excited
I swear this is the only one I would buy at full price 😍
That's cool and all but, who asked for this?
IM SOOOO EXCITED 😩😩😩😩😩😩
The biggest fear of my childhood is back: the burglar music.
No Fae...?
i am so excited for this pack
Wait We can build ponds now whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat??????And Fish in them!!! I saw the sign :)
Love it! are we gonna get horses with this tho?
Daw the lama is soo cute! Tho I wish they added horses to.. it’s the perfect pack for it too they could of had trail rides.. n competitions.. races and stuff.. I’d also like to have fairy’s too as a playable sim. Maybe werewolf s for Halloween.
This actually looks really great!
My dream lifestyle! The world design looks so beautiful and I've missed canning so much. Can't wait to play this.
Do he have grocery? A grocery store?
this- this is an expansion pack yall !!! it looks awesome!
Time to start a new legacy 😃
Omg I’m glad I preordered this game pack lol
Okay at first I wasn’t really sure about this pack. But this looks incredible! I’m so excited!
DID I JUST SEE THEM MAKE A POND?
Can. Not. Wait!!!
I have little faith in TS4 as a lot of the packs have been abysmal, but this pack looks really good ... however, I know that EA loves to twist their marketing to make it seem like you can do certain things that you actually can't, so I'm going to wait for a review from LGR first before I even consider buying...
But can we finally keep bunnies???
cadê os cavalo porra
Loved Harold the llama
Aaaw this is so cute! ❤️😍
I want this so badddd
FINALLY!!! A pack that I can't wait to get 😍😍😍 everything looks so lovely 😍😍😍
So happy to live out what I want to do In real life. Y'all did good
so hyped for this, and such a great trailer, love the voiceover and the new british food!! finally my sims can eat crumpets and toad in the hole and everything else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please don't make me regret this, i'm so hopeful :')
This is literally the dream pack I’ve been asking for! Only thing missing is horses💕
Can’t wait 💚
this looks so good, good job ea team
Wow! 😍😍😍
the sims community: can we please have gameplay trailers that aren’t just YA women narrating? ea: you bet. here’s a llama
Okayyy this expansion pack looks worth the money 💳💥💥
An English version of Sims 4!
Waiting on sims 5 👀
Omg so excited!
The burglar sound during th fox tho, EA WHY YOU TORTURING US, JUST GIVE US BURGLARS!
Alright, but where are the quails?
I just pre-ordered the dlc, I cannot wait
Other than the entrance to the animal shed this looks really well done
POND. TOOLS.
Looks good and everything, but we are going so far from the original sims game. The whole vibe is just so different, guess we'll never experience what we have 10+ years ago
What about pigs and horses?
I’m so excited!!!
Where are the horses 😐 ea still sucks idc not paying 40 bucks for this
I can’t wait for this curly hair
I love the new pack! And horses whoud fit perfect! Its just an idea, but I cant wiattttt!!
now if you got get together and this pack WOW
imagine if fairies were included in this pack
WAIT, BEEF WELLINGTON. COWS. NO AUTOMATICALLY FILLED REFRIGERATOR. MEAT. MEAT!! MEEEEEEEEEAT!
Wait so if you buy this pack before September 2nd you will get the tree, bike and the gnome?!?
Can the pc game work for Xbox one?
We can build ponds now!!!
Thank you for putting canning in this pack and not a kit!
SO ADORABLE! Can't wait to get my hands on it!!
0:0-3:50 super hyped 3:51 wait, is that it? I think that sums up my feelings on this. Looks like another Island Living/Snowey Escape to me
can i have a cow in my apartment
ARE THERE PIGS???
UUMMM I will buy this simply to be able to make crumpets and beef wellington
Time to make Llamas with Hats in the Sims
WHERE ARE THE HORSES, STEEPLECHASE AND EVENTING AREAS! PLEASE make some of those things too!!! 😫
I pre ordered this,before I saw this trailer, and I am so excited for this pack, it looks incredible. I see Devon Bumpkin sat at the picnic table at the start of the trailer hahaha 😁💖
Am i the only one exited about A RIDE-ABLE BIKE LIKE OMFG I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SOME KIND OF TRANSPORT SINCE I GOT THE SIMS
The narration gives me monty python vibes
Wait a minute…. I see a well…. Can we gather water from a well?? 2:21 right side in back
I think we would have been better off with a zoo expansion pack ....  Yay for negativity 😅👍
It's so weird when EA actually gives us exactly what we asked for.
So this looks like a Game Pack. It's a farming and living-off-of-the-land game. Looks fun, but it doesn't affect and expand all the worlds.
I would die for Harold 😭
It's giving me the all the boring homestead things I want my Sims to do in the country style that I love! One step closer to Farming Sims.
Where are the rabbits 🐇?
Aden? Aden is that you? Fancy meeting you picnicking here
I wish royalty came with this.
Harold is a god among men
Omg the llama is soooo cute!
me: ok but THOSE HAIR😩✋🏻
I'm not crying, you are crying.
YORKSHIRE PUDDINGS?!!!!!
EA's becoming more and more.. risque shall i say?  😂
I can't wait. This is right up my alley. So cute!!
I’m so beyond happy they went with cottagecore with farming :’)
THIS IS SO AMAZING, I CANT I DIDNT KNOW I WILL NEED THIS PACK, BUT YES, I NEED IT AND IM GONNA SPEND NIGHTS FOR PLAYING THE SIMS 4 WITH THIS PACK
Someone message Call me Keven, Jim & Turg need a lama.
THE HUGE FLY AMANITA MUSHROOMS 🍄
The fox has a burglars mask but we still dont have burglars
Я ВЛЮБИЛАСЬ!!! СОВЕРШЕННО!  Зачем мне свой дачный участок когда есть прекрасное дополнение для Симс 4!
This is the first time in years I actually want to play the sims again... it looks amazing!
This is the best trailer we have gotten I’m so excited ❤️❤️
THE SWANS
This is cool but i don't think it is worth 50 dollars let alone an expansion pack.
This reminds me so much of the westcountry in the UK. Like, fully like home.
Best Pack Yes
I NEED. I'm broke....
Now let’s just pray this pack works on release! 🙏🏼
0.41 is that Agnes?
“Let’s say you made the awful decision of choosing a cow” This message was in collaboration with the chickens from Chic-fil-a
Too bad you refuse to put this same effort into fixing bugs.
Being British, I really like the whole look and vibe.
I look forward to this. This one will probably be my favorite EP and I didnt even want farming hahaha
Simmers: we want horses  The creators : DiD yOu SAy lLaMas
This is so cool. Best gameplay trailer to date sims team
Harold is my new spirit animal
EA might be improving...I want burglars though...maybe next update since you have swiper the fox hahahahahah!
Sims goes harvest moon and animal Crossing in one expansion pack
Bruh this is so COOL congrats the sims
I am SO HAPPY to finally have chickens 🤩🤩🤩
Jam making is my favourite in person past time so I can't wait to make my sims do it too
I finally get to make my country folk.
It looks so good! I’m so happy!
LMFAO AH 3:09
Swiped the Fox in the sims confirmed?
The Sims: CANNING !! Me: *silently opens mods folder and deleting icemunmun's canning mod*
I am VERY EXCITED for Paralives.
And remember: not all images appear in-game. Keep low expectations, always keep them low with the Sims 4
this just reminds me of the british country side
Oooh merci, il est déjà pré-commandé pour moi mais au moins ça fait plaisir, ça aide à patienter, cette petite vidéo 🤩👌 (si seulement Nintendo faisait un peu plus de pub pour les futures mise à jour d'Animal Crossing New Horizons, comme vous le faites, même si on paye pour avoir plus de contenu, au moins on n'est pas oubliés chez les Sims et EA 😉 merci !!)
Is story progression coming with this expansion patch?
Let's go cottagecore lesbians~
If I’m not mistaken this trailer (the narration) is referencing Richard Ayoade’s Travel Man series
Seems boring but I need a new world to get sims pregnant in😂
I'm so sad my laptop is broken right now :( Hope i can play this very soon.
I’ve not been this excited for a pack, ever!
Just another disappointed add on
I WANT THIS RIGHT NOW
"Tipping for joy"? ...Was that a hint? Can mischievous or mean sims tip cows?
The fox! omg his little mask and sweater lol
3:09 w h y ?
Horses sold separately :(
0:40 mrs. crumplebottoms?
Oh how badly I want to play with this!!!!
Now this feels overwhelming and shallow. Just like any other sims 4 “expansion”
That was amazing
Harold where do i get the bunnys man :( all this sounds good but b u n n y
caaarl!
Bunny :0
Very nice EA!
Omg wow! :D
I love how British this pack is 😂
Please don’t disappoint with this ea, I haven’t been this excited about the sims 4 in…ever
Ahhh i am so excited for this pack !!
The best trailer for an EP i've seen in a loooooooooong time! Im excited, y'all.
Where’s the horses!😭
So cute, and the world is beautiful!
Please remake the sims castaway. The Playstation version 🙏🙏🙏
I hate to say, but EA, you have my atention
I'm in love 🥺
1:07 🥺🥺🥺such a cute family
Wow amazing
Just imagine they added meat from cow 🤣 that would be such a battleground 🙈
3:09 is my favorite part
the bar is so low
This actually looks…………amazing
omg i hate voice overs
Looks cute, regardless of sims stealing 2 ideas from Icemunmun, lol.
احبك Sims😘
Is that moss from it crowd 💀
Omg the foxes! Yorkshire pudding! Farming! My need for an English Town vibe with my sims is finally met
I never buy packs until they’re on sale but this… I may have to make an exception for
"Fine! I'll give you the wool on my back" Harold is a treasure
My favorite pack! Simmers mention too much the cars...THIS is what i want.
I cant wait to play thisssss ahhhhhh
Awwww i love lamas😍😍
Looks fine. I have the feeling it’s gonna be hella buggy though. Let’s see how you do.
this may actually make me buy the Sims 4
Stardew Valley in the Sims here I come
I randomly got reccomended this when I haven’t watched The Sims 4 content for a year or two now, I clicked because I saw a Llama wearing shades and a rainbow scarf
As someone from the middle of nowhere in the English countryside, where the nearest shops/markets are in the nearby village, all I can say is that this is so on point!!!! I'M SCREAMINGGGGGGGGG
OMG Thank youuuu
why does the lamas voice reminds me of uk frank gallagher
Cozyy
Simdew Valley
Thank you!
Living in a cottage is my biggest dream Can't wait to beg my dad to buy this for me
this is what we need for a long time very happy they went with this concept
just bring us the sims 5
I DONT WANNA WAIT AHH
They should have named this pack: ✨ the virtual animal abuse pack ✨
Good pack for my old farmer sim well it’s gardening but now it will be farming
The update we've all bee waiting for
I am not capable knowing the fact that farm animals die...
3:08 excuse me WHAT DID I JUST HEAR HIM SAY? Did I hear that correctly 💀
The cottagecore and farmcore communities must be having a field day (esp with farmland mod out too)
Mrs. Crumplebottom!!!!!!
Love it 😌
please EA, Maxis! Can you FOR THE LOVE OF ALL MIGHTY GOD, make a FUNCTIONAL juice blender for TS3, as the one it has in TS2?! I already begged to many modders but they say they can't. PLEASE, EA! I don't play TS4 but I'm addicted to TS3 and 2 for LIFE!
Me: not sure if I need new expansion pack  Harold: *exists*  Me: yep I need it!
I love it I love it I love it I can't wait!!!!!!
If we are not able to befriend an actual fox (not just a dog reskin) I’m gonna be dissapointed-
I CANNOT WAIT 😍😍😍
Yay 💚💚
Will no-one ask if we can finally make ponds and a board for fishing??? Omg Before it was bb.moveobjects abuse and honestly boring... If some water idle physics added to pond surface, I'll buy the pack for that alone!
Love how it says "Not all images appear in-game" whilst it's a GAMEPLAY... Lol
This is the pack I've been waiting for. I really don't care what else we get now lol
I cant wait for this ahhhhhhhh
2:19 My favorite part!
YAS 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I’m just gonna have a cottage farm of cows and chickens, raising them to compete in the fair
See that like to dislike ratio? That's how it's done EA. *Boots Batuu back in its box*
ok EA I usually hate you but this time just shut-up-and-take-my-money.jpg
The thing I got the most excited for was the cherry dress why am I like this
i've never been so excited to own cows and chickens in my entire life!! it looks like such a fun gamepack 🥺
Awe.....animals
I can’t believe we can ride cows And stuff This is gon be so cool! ☺️
I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS PACK OMG
I love this. ❤️❤️❤️
FOR ANY SIMS FANS WHO ARE SICK OF EA'S MONEY GRABBING, THERE IS A NEW GAME ON THE HORIZON CALLED "PARALIVES", check it out on youtube. I'm not a goddamn bot I'm just really hyped about it.
swiper no swiping!
Take my money now
I want the LIGHT TREE I WANT THE LIGHT TREE I WANT THE LIGHT TREE I WANT THE LIGHT TREE
Am I the only one who is not excited for this? It feels like they only showed animals and that’s about it, and the cats and dogs in this game are already a hand full.
Whenever I first saw the trailer, I lost my fricken marbles. I still don’t think I’ve fully found them….
the children cooking should have been in parenhood
This expansion is looking to be the gratest!
Cue the Llama song from Milo Murphy's Law
Its everything what I‘ve ever wanted in the Sims. Love everything about it 😍♥️
CHICKENS!!!! 🐓 🐥
Beautiful pack, now playtest it until its it's perfect!
I am screaming!! I have been wanting this pack for so long. I just wish they added pigs, horses, goats, sheep and ducks
No because I’m crying
I love everything about this pack. Thank you!!! <3
Finally, my cottagecore dreams can come true
Yep I called it. There’s a ‘ cherry dress ‘ that is clearly very inspired of the beloved strawberry dress.
I can't wait for this pack!! This is what I have been looking for, but I wish you could make a barn for your cows, and order your farm animals through phone or computer. but everything else I am excited for!😊✨
So can we buy food ingredients now or not?
Anyone else stuck with Legacy Edition but likes watching the new trailers even though you can't have the packs?
Does this mean all the gardening bugs are finally fixed after 7 years? Or are you going to leave those in and and make this pack 50% worthless and frustrating to play?
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I didn't see too many features in this trailer tbh. knowing sims 4 they'll showcase every last feature in the trailers and livestreams- "sims can now high five each other! picnic baskets come in 5 swatches!" Other sims games would have so many features, you couldn't fit them in the trailer, and the player would be left to discover on their own. who knew sims 3 pets would end up giving us plastic surgery at the hospital? I hope they really fleshed out the cottage living gameplay features. I've also been liking the trend of introducing core gameplay features like sentiments and likes/dislikes. hope they continue that
Did I see DevonBumpkin in this? 😂
I'm so excited for this! It reminds me of where I live in the UK.
i am sobbing this looks amazing
Genuinely so excited for this pack, like it just FEELS like such an upgrade. Love it, love the aesthetic, love the hinted actions, love the canning, love the needlework- LOVE it.
Do I want cottage living?  no. Am I going to buy it so I can buy a llama?  yes.
finally!!! picnics!!!
No pigs?
It’s giving the Sims 4 Stardew Valley Expansion 😂
Loove it!! 💖💖💖💖😍😍
what about the rabbits??
so so excited <3
YASSS
Ansiosaaaa!
This is quite possibly everything I ever wanted from the sims
I’m just excited to make a farm house and put a big family in it. And have dogs to of course, that’s a necessity.
so cute but I wish it came with Horses🥺🥰💕
Are we talking about couple? They're so sweet 🥺💖. And i love the Lamar 💖
Not much gameplay shown. All we know is that you can bottle stuff and sheer llamas. Cool and now, wish it showed me. Eh, I'm buying it anyway lol.
I’m buying the pack just for Harold the llama 🦙
I HOPE that if I activate simple living I will have to HAVE the ingredients in the fridge in order to cook and not just pay for the dish. I want that realism and I can't find a mod that does what I want
The Sims 3 is still the best one.
I can’t wait to start a new closely-knit family in Henford-On-Bagely :D
I for sure hope that Harold is a part of the game.
Bravo ! Bravo! WEEEEEE!!!!!!
I've been saying garden to tabes since this premiered and i can't stop. I'm actually hype for a sims pack and it feels wrong lol
Anyone else getting fairytale vibes from this? Personally, this is the perfect pack to do a Disney Princess challenge with
I feel as if the "plants big enough to make you blush" and eggplant was intentional
How cute is this?! 🥺😭
Beware! "not all images appear in game." On the outset, I like the "look" and the "idea" of this pack. I love a small English village and the idea of strolling through the village talking to friends or shopping or just relaxing at the pub is very appealing. I'm pretty sure there won't be many "open" shops to visit but if we can window shop or there are other "outside" things to do and places to visit, then I will be okay with that. My favorite town is Strangerville because it feels like a small town whereas other packs gave us a shopping center to visit and there was no intimacy that Strangerville and HoB seem to offer. My only issue with Strangerville was that there was not enough town lots to build on and add my ideas for shops or restaurants or places to go in the town proper. I have a feeling that HoB may suffer from the same issue. I know there are four lots in the town neighborhood but I also know that two are GC made houses and one is a pub. I would be hard pressed to demo any of those but that leaves one town lot. Not much. All the objects and clothes look great. So happy to have a new robe for guys. I like that we finally have new wallpapers that add character. Love the big flowers, leaves and veggies that can be on the walls. WOOHOO! A new woohoo spot in the shed. Cowplant jam what must that taste like? Didn't see anything about gardening together or did I miss it? FOX-B-GONE? Well at least my eggs will be safe. I hope there are more than two outdoor shops to visit. Even two of the same stand would make it look more full and make it appear that you have more than one choice.  If there is only one of each, what happens when we want to run the food stand or the seed stand? They already have assigned NPCs to run them. Can we place our own stand down somewhere to compete or do we evict that NPC? This was a cute video but it didn't really answer any questions but it did create a few more. We got another overhead view of the "magic?" neighborhood. It looks great but it also looks empty which, in this game, equates to useless. Unless there is something special about that area that we know nothing about yet, what will make it worthwhile to have in the game (we now know that it's not about magic or fairies)? If it's just background world filler, I would rather that neighborhood to be dropped and more lots added to the remaining two neighborhoods.
Oh my gosh! This just might be the best EP yet!
I love how they say already “not all images that appear on screen are in-game”
The best sims pack yet. EA actually did something _good_
this was made for the LGBTQ+ community and no one can tell me otherwise
I wonder if it's just a coincidence, or they're going to modders or something. Fame, candle making, canning... all mods first.
Ok this is not a gameplay ._. At least I hope it looks like the video .-.
Just preordered it! So glad your listening to our requests!
Yess! I am soo glad they have the fend for your own food idea! I missed that from the Sims 2 or 3 on playstation when you would have to go to the grocery store and buy or grow the ingredients for recipes. Makes it feel much more realistic. I am sooo excited for this pack!
this is possibly the most original expansion they've made for sims 4 (besides that bizarre recycling pack). this one actually looks like it has the replayable factor
I’m so happy that Llamas are finally in the Sims 🥺
Sims was like: this fox shall be named Swiper and we have an alarm that’ll tell him Swiper no swiping
Why is the Llama British? Not only that he's posh? Posh Llama
So ready for cows and llamaaasssss
Umm do my eyes deceive me…. PONDS!?!?!?!?
they've put the sims 2 burglar sound to the fox animation,,,,,,, speechless.
Good voice actor
Im so excited, but also don't want to get my hopes up. 🥺🙌
YORKSHIRE PUDDINGS!!!!!
This is awesome! 😁
I promise you, this whole video can be taken out of context.
Can't wait!<3
EA fix origin will you?! I wanna preorder this but it won’t let me login! I uninstalled and reinstalled but the login message hits me with “unable to log on at this time. Please try again later.”   Anyone else with this problem?
Okay but tell me more about the bunnies. 🥺
okay but there're the rabbits
looks pretty boring.....................
Having off the grid sims is going to be so much more fun now
I'm waiting for youtube to start recommending me that this pack is another disappointment. I hope not but yeah. Maybe it's time for some medieval stuff?
i'm so excited for this pack, it will be so cute and relaxing
Did they just threw a whole jar of jam to the pot?  Oh dear god...
I am so excited!!
I want this so freaking bad
ANXIOUS!!!!!!!
Dear Sims team! This is amazing! Thank you so much for this content. I have a question if you could answer. Has a vet student I'm really interested to know if I'll be able to care for this new animals in my practice in game. Thanks <3
good
Aww I was hoping we could have foxes for pets.
Tbh you should’ve included bigger stalls where like 5-8 animals have place but now I have to place 8 separate small stalls if I want many animals and you should’ve added animals like pigs too
CottageCore: The pack
This looks awesome, but I really hope they patch Dream Home Decorator before this comes out.
this is the best pack ea chose to create make since island living, the first time i'm actually excited for a sims 4 thing in a long time!! finally somenthing that actually caters to fans and that we've been asking for it's been while
where are the pigs!!!!!??
3:09 um...sims based?
idk how I feel about this
Sims team got tired of bein upstaged by modders, huh lol
LAAAKKKEEESSSS ??????
I wanna keep the fox as a pet <3
The pack is so cute and cool! But the narrator sounds like the guy from Wallace and Gromit XD
Hopefully the wood swatches match
this is the most excited i’ve been about a new pack in ages!!
Ayo Swiper no swiping.
AHHHHHH
This honestly looks so fun and I’m so excited to get this pack. 😭
Okay..but this pack is rly starting to appeal to me
BRING WEREWOLVES AND FAIRIES BACK PLEASE!!!!
Yasss I’ve been waiting for those kind of animals my hohle life
So is that fox coop alarm a little teaser for burglars one day?.......🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔!!!!!
Ehhh… why cant we have more than 1 cow🙄
Damn EA will you stop trying to steal my money 😒
I love this pack!!! I feel like we are finally getting a pack that's worth the price. They didn't show much of rabbits in this trailer. Hopefully, the rabbits would end up giving us a surprise. I don't want that to be a sign of a lack of gameplay in rabbits.
I am definitely buying this omg
Horses tho...
I love it :)
IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS DEFINITELY BUYING
hello lgbtq community
I haven’t been this excited about a pack since Island Living. WOW. 🥺😍
hesitantly optimistic abt this one...
Omg that trailer was everything!, and it was hilarious 😂 you guys did amazing!. Looking forward to having this pack, probably will be my favorite by far!. 👏🏼👍🏼💙
Im sold the second llama show up
The lesbians are foaming at the mouth right now
Thanks for the subtitles

Is Jim Pickens gonna give up his old ways and settle down as a farmer? Nah he’ll probably hijack a family and make them human livestock
Harold is my spirit animal
Nooo why would yall make us woohoo inside the barn,the poor animals eyes 😵 thats their home
Im so excited..... you day Yorkshire pudding? Ugh yes please 😍

Omg... WAS THAT A LAKEEE?! EXCUSE ME?
Cool
3:09 Jschlatt?
0:25 pastel pink?!
Never forget: Maxis implemented Fox thieves before Burglars in an almost decades old game.
Is there literally anything that doesn't exist in basegame or one of the previous packs in here? Except for farm animals as objects bound to their barns/coops?
Not the Sims making me cry with how beautiful it looks...
21 MORE DAYS. I ALREADY PREORDERED THIS. 😃
Did y’all see the strawberry dress that had cherrys instead
Amazing i can’t wait!
As soon as the Sims 2 burglar music came on, I SCREAMED.
wait we will be able to do our own lakes now?! OMG Im so exicited about this new pack :O
IM BUYING THIS
Reminds me of wales or the cotswalds
time to live out the folklore lifestyle i’ve been wanting to for the past 11 months
OMG WE CAN MAKE PONDS!!! NO MORE SHITTY FOUNTAINS DISGUISED WITH ROCKS!!!!
I'm so excited AAAAAAAAAHHHH
Ok But Regarding Foxes, what if we have a pet fox from Cats and Dogs...
Ok, I'm intrigued!
Me iba my head : Im so ready to build my ranchito
NOW 💳💳💳💥💥💳💥💥
Loved the llama narrator. As a born and raised English person this looks amazing .
That was an extremely solid and facts filled trailer! I'm so on board with the dry British humor. 😅
*$30* Sims 4 Cottage living < *$15* Farming Simulator 2019 Plat Edition
its so beautiful!! thank you sims team!! <3
Ten dubbing skojarzył mi się z Alastorem z Hazbin Hotel xD
I'm calling it right now, this is going to be the best expansion pack ever made from The Sims 4 team.
I really need this new pack
Ay a proper pub finally
OMG! I'M so excited for this paaaack
Why does this sound like British Ben Shapiro
wait did I see a pond ?!!!
This look so cute. 😫
COWS BABY COWS
Is it just me or do the bunny's sound like Togepi? 💕
I’m getting All Creatures Great and Small vibes here
that aubergine thou ;)
So I can either by a barren EA expansion for $30... or the Platinum edition of Farming Simulator 2019... for the price of a 25% off Game Pack... A game so massive it has its own eSport.. Yeah I think I know which is worth it and what people should buy
This is everything I’ve ever wanted😭
Can WE INTERBREED ANIMALS NOW??? New scientist career.
that pond tool thou
*rubs hands together* time to live out my cottagecore lesbian fantasy
Waiting for Kayla to upload a video about this
the voice over was kind of annoying but this was very informative
This just made me want this pack even more🥲
3:09    what did he sayyyyy??????????
Solo puedo decir  wow
one like and i’ll buy a laptop just to play this 😂
Это прекрасно ≧∇≦❤❤❤
*"Not all images appear in-game"*, could they be more specific? That could literally mean all of it 🤦
This trailer is great, so exciting!!!
0:46 AHHH THE TODDLER HAIR!!
POND?
ahhh i hope we will get an update where we can purchase a second home bcs i would like to have a second house in country side. overall very excited for this pack
cc hairstyles... 🤔
TAKE MY MONEY!
Would it be considered cannibalism if a cow plant eats a cow though….?
Are Tropico and Sims set in the same Universe? lol
Remember kids, all the content will be done after a few hours and will add nothing to the rest of the game certainly not depth, but you are gonna buy it anyways!
IM IN LOVE
AGNES CRUMPLEBOTTOM!!! Shes bacccckkkk omgggg
i love that the fox is wearing a sweater and eye mask LOL
OK, BUT WHY NOT HORSES, C'MON!!!
Ah, they’ve got cottagecore lesbians on the team now
PICNICS
The sims 3 tinha tudo isso incluso no pacote de expansão pets. Toma vergonha na cara, EA empresa mercenária!
What about pigs and horses?
So it’s 8 chickens per coop? Can I place as many coops as I want? Omg that’s the chaotic mess I’m here for 😂
I'm actually really excited for this pack!!
the dream pack is coming😫😭
What about the delivering food to the home is that still accurate? I wish that would be part of the update as well.
I NEED this!!! ❤️🌈🦙
For the first time in a long while, I'll be buying a pack on release day disregarding the worry about new bugs that'll come with it
IM SO EXCITED
this trailer feels longer than it should be
I actually feel happy and excited about a pack, well doneeeee!!!!! This is what we need
I'm in love with this pack ❤❤❤
As Simon Cowell would say, it's a yes from me
Idk about you... but Parrot tell me about Cottage Living
I screamm!! this is looks so real to be true 😭😭😭 but i couldn't get this pack soon bcs i've to save money😥😭😭
the mallard ducks, the swans, that fuckin signpost, those grey brick buildings!!!!!! i may have grown up in the place that was the heart of the industrial revolution, but i've been to plenty of local villages too and this just screams english countryside, i'm so happy to finally have something that's not an american simulator <333
Not the Llama saying blush while showing those big eggplants 🍆 pfffft
This was such a good voice over - good job on the trailer!
thumbs up for the llamas so cute thumbs down for horses replaced by llamas and cows as in Sims 3.
WEVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS
OMG I AM GOING TO PASS OUT I LOVE THIS PACK
It looks so amazing!
Ah so excited!!!
This is a really awesome pack!  I knew there was a reason I pre-ordered it!  I love the dairy coral and chicken coop from The Sims 3, and this brings those things back even better!  I just hope that when you milk cows and harvest eggs, you also have the option to sell them.🐄🐄🐔🐔🐓🥚🥚🥛🥛.
i haven’t been this excited for a pack since university!!
Good job EA 👏🏼!! Im actually impressed..
When gran arrived, they were all asleep after very long preparations for gran's arrival.  > A very Sims moment
1:44 please tell me we're getting a strawberry swatch of that dress
still let down that we are not getting horses in this pack
At last! A real llama in the game
Can the cows and lamas have babies (not with each other obv :p). Would be so cute!
Sooo if a sim makes a chicken dish, will 1 of the 8 chickens die? I'm genuinely concerned 😂
fox-be-gone is definitely a burglar hint. it’s coming soon. WATCH
This is the weirdest gameplay trailer ever 🤣
This pack is now a want, it’s a NEED 🥺
yes yes yes
For the first time, I preordered as soon as this was announced. This is everything I wanted plus more! I. Can. Not. Wait!!! ❤️❤️❤️
the video being more than 3 minutes.
Would be so cool if we could get not only fox burglars, but human burglars too 😆
IM SO FREAKING EXCITED OMG
I cant!!! Wait!!!
Столько всего что даже страшно
Sims 4 has gone to the lowest of the low. It has MOBILE adverts. Oh dear...
I was so hesitant when this was first announced but this looks like a lot of fun
You can make Yorkshire puddings?😌
Meh.  Im just glad simmers will stop asking for farming on every pack.  I'll wait for a sale.
The Grim Reaper hugging the Llama made me audibly gasp.  My heart!
Eeeek its so amazing
This is the best trailer yet voiceover wise
MISS CRUMPLEBOTTOM IM GOING TO DIE
i need this
One thing we all need to agree: the marketing team for the sims is amazing. They really make we belive in EA even after all those years of failure and bad decisions.
Love it, love Harold 😂
IM SO EXCITED
This is everything I've ever wanted in the sims 😭 COWS! I CAN'T WAIT 😭😭
PONDS I SAW PONDS MAKE YOUR OWN POND AHHHHH
So it’s The Sims 4: Harvest Moon
OMG that melody when the fox appears!!! Burglar!!!!
I just hope thorne bailey wont randomly show up in my small village
is it weird i’m most excited for the chickens-
Do vampires get any other kind of food besides salad??
Wow, that fridge lot trait is going to be great for my freegan character. They keep getting snacks from the fridge and becoming sad because they had to pay for it.
Wait a second... Is the sims community actually excited for a new pack?
So we get Burglars back?...kinda lol (i love that the fox wears a mask >_<) Why is this the siliest theyve been in a pack in a while? I love it.
Am I going to live out my medieval fantasies through this pack? Hell yes.
Why is no one talking about lot challenges?? We are getting a whole new trait feature for lots!! It might even be a base game update!!
3:08 ..... THE WHAT NOW?
All your packs are sht
I wish they showed more of the bunnies, like they are going to be a new pet you can make in create a sim right? 🥺 I just don’t want my hopes to get up about them and then they end up just being animals among the world :((
ANIMALS, PONDS, FARMING, COTTAGE CORE. WHAT ELSE COULD YOU WANT??!! I'm not exited at all nope
YAAAS THE SIMS ARE GETTING IN WITH THE COTTAGECORE GAYS WE SEE YOU ♥️
I'm a little upset that they included chickens but didn't include rabbits. I thought rabbits would be included and it was the main reason I was planning on purchasing Country Living :(
RAINBOW COW RAINBOW COW RAINBOW COW
i want the tree with the rabbit hole so bad
I thought Cottage Living couldn't get more exciting and then you put a Llama presenting the pack!! This is probably my favorite trailer ever! 🤭 I can't wait for farm live!! 🤩🥰
this is SUCH a tiktok pandering pack 😅 but im totally here for it.
I feel like the fox was a burglar hint. So far I really like this pack 😊
WE ARE FINALLY GETTING MORE ANIMALS THAN JUST CATS AND DOGS WOOOOOOOOO
But i want to play now 😭
See EA? You can listen to your customers and make games that everyone loves, so just keep doing that instead of following your own ideas of what the simmers want to see ^^
ok, this trailer made me tear up fr, i love it here :)
They’re selling you the same thing over and over again in different shells. Yall fall for it so easy 😭
Let’s see what this expensive dissappointment is all about
THEYVE GOT YORKSHIRE PUDDINGS!!!!
Looking good!
I LOVE HOW BRITISH THIS IS
harold is an icon
Can’t wait for the stable, horse, and skunk mods
I SCREAMED WHEN PICNICS AND NEW TERRAIN TOOLS WERE SHOWN
So we finally can build a pond in sims 4!!!
omg i love it
SWANS
I Love it!
Quando vai lançar the sims 5?
This looks incredible. I'm so excited for this pack.
You said LLAMAS?!!!! I'M SOLD!
I need this right now!!!!
What about the bunnies in the trailer?
cute...but im not too impressed because I've been playing a lot of Sims 3 recently and I can do a lot of this in sims 3 with some dlc.
A cottagecore pack?! Yes, please
I'm so excited at how English this is! EVEN YORKSHIRE PUDDINGS!!!
this is the most entertaining trailer so far 😂
im broke bcuz i bought all of ts3 the other day but i wish i could at least get agnes crumplebottom in my game because man i really want her
Ok I didn't know I needed this!  The Sims team is finally getting back on track. July 22nd can't come fast enough! So excited to play this
AHHH im most excited for the simple living lot trait, I've always wanted to let my sims only cook food only if they have ingredients so this will be really satisfying for me even if its a small feature in the pack <3
i wish it were coming out sooner, it’s impossible to wait 😖
Yesss! A pack that actually we want!
CANNING
Looking forward to pirating this! Get rekt, EA!
So amazing!! 😍
I love Harold
Congrats Sims Team for finally doing something about the enternally full fridge! I love that this adds more realism to the game. It'll make Rags to Riches even more challenging
The shade against the cows LMAO
what are we so mean to cows for? Now my lots will be filled with cows idc about llamas
Coooool
Lesbian Living seems like a good pack! Nice!
@amandabb
what about the rabbits!???
cameron tucker is shaking
The fact this trailer is narrated by a LLAMA makes me so glad I pre ordered this pack.
For the first time in a while, I'm actually excited for a sims pack!
1:06 Did I just see @DevonBumpkin
I`m so excited <3
This looks cute I would get it. too bad it'll probably be 50$ like every other sims 4 expansion pack a little bit of a steep price but for this expansion pack it might just be worth it
Grim Reaper cuddling animals is a mood.  Also I cannot wait to enablefreebuild the Ruins. It's already nice as it is. But it can always be better.
I just like the llama’s narration😁
OMG we have a burglar fox😂
Dios mío que berenjena mas grande.
ok but why there are coop burglars and not actual burglars that break into houses to steal!? i meannnnnnn come on xD
IM in love
This is basically the first expansion that I'm willing to buy immediately at full price.
I cannot wait to play this! Outdoor retreat and get together have been my favorites for the outdoorsy and European style world and now I just get to add on to my sims stories! :)
YAY 🥳🥳🥳
Is that a pond?! Like, a proper pond? Not the fountain tool?!
😂 and I’m so exited
I don’t play the sims 4 anymore but I gotta say this looks amazing and the gameplay already looks pleasing
Love it!!!!
Bro this pack might be my favorite one they’ve ever made and it’s not even out yet
Kudos on adding animals!!!!!!!!!!!! 😍✨✨✨✨✨✨ So the fox in the hen house is an egg connoisseur. Ovivores Foxes is a new non-violent twist to the whole " Fox in the Henhouse ", I must admit. 🤔 But I would have like to have been able to ride the LLama about as I would a cycle. Well We'll see how the livestream goes. I do have high hopes for this pack. The more group/ singles activities will make game re-playable much longer. I would like to ask for muilt-Sim games in the yard that last longer then two secs - like the soccer ball practice played between three or more Sims with "luck", fitness, wellness and even a soccer level to be taken in for scoring to determine the winner, with rewards titles like twenty game winner, 50 game winner and so on.  I have the trailer scheduled. Thank you for listening.
can we slaughter the animals?
IM GONNA START CRYING I CAN MAKE COTTAGECORE LESBIANS IN THE IN THE SIMS NOW
Can’t wait to see the new animals do the same cycle of animations and being stuck to 1 area, exciting
I haven’t played the sims at all for a long time and this genuinely makes me excited to play again.
Куда ж без женьшеня в трейлере. 🙄
I really love that you can order it over a month after it comes out and still get the bonus items. That should be enough time for me to watch the Simmers give their reviews and know what I'm getting into, and get $40 together.
0:16 this is me. this is exaclty me. I had never felt so seen
We all know LLAMA stands for...  Long Live  All  Maxis  Art  ^__^!
so is agnes crumplebottom now canonically british in the sims 4
I’m so excited. But I know I need to be realistic with my expectations 🙌
I can’t remember the last time I was so excited about a pack
Still missing horses
There's a Fable 3 reference in this trailer
This looks like so much fun!! One aesthetic complaint though: I wish the cow/llama home entrances weren’t pitch black. It just looks off to me. I wish they were more like the chicken homes where it sort of fades and looks more natural.
This is literally all I've ever wanted for the Sims and it doesn't even feel real lol
I’m so so excited for this
Ich freu mich so hehe
I’m sold. Take my money EA.
Nice played, EA. You have listened to the community and give them what they want. This pack looks promising and very complete, I hope to you keep doing stuff like this.
british life simulator
왜 심즈는 라마를 좋아하져? 심한테 엄마가 라마라고 암시하기는 욕인뎅
I've never been so excited for a Sims 4 pack in ages ♡♡♡
Cant wait for this! Now sims can finally live off the land. Combined with eco-living and even knitting its gonna be really fun to let Sims make everything on their own.
Sims Jeremy  Clarkson? 👀 if anyone hasn't seen the series and are major into all this, 100% recommend
YESSS
WAIT- so we can make real looking lakes now? I've been waiting this for YEARS😭
3:23 I'M SORRY...WAS THAT SOUND WAS I THOUGHT IT WAS?!
i am unbelievably exited!!! 😍😍😍
hell yeah!!! i preordered and i’m so excited for it to come out! 😁
I'm gonna trust in the fact that we didn't get much told about rabbits. The pack looks promising, but I'm wondering if it's enough to be worth it.
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
I'm so excited oh my god
Really didn´t like the style of this trailer but I am so excited for the pack! Next up horses please, equestrian living??
Huge congrats to the writing team for this trailer! Chuckled and smiled all the way :D  Looking forward to this pack <3
I truly enjoyed this trailer! It was so different from other trailers done in the past.
It would’ve been good if you made a Yorkshire or southern English voice type for this pack, seems as it’s an English village pack
I want to live there in real life :)
3:25 The Sims 2 burglar music!
LETS GO LESBIANS LETS GO LESBIANS
As vegan player I’m looking forward to have my animal shelter in the game 🥰🐮🐔🦙🐇
The city looks so cute 😍 cant wait !
Jam making, the animals, the village, the farm lifestyle, this is everything I've ever wanted
LAMA
FINALLY! Something fun...
Looks like a fun pack, but it's being held back by recycled animations, focus on emotions and the insistence of doing trailers in English rather than Simlish.
ahhh yes, this is the sims quality I pay for
What about rabbits? They will they be available as pets?
Something tells me I need cats and dogs for this-
This is so so so cute, this will be my favorite expansion for sure 💖😭.
This is Harvest Moon in the Sims4 🤣 Fantastic job!
the countdown begins!!!
Kylie: IS THAT A CHICKEN???    Sorry I'm excited for chicken
1:02 a trans character :D
The two gays with the adopted black children 🥴😂 Please, I'm screaming
So basically icemunmun's Harvestables and Canning Station, KawaiiStacie's My First Farm Animal and Brazenlotus's Retail Produce Stalls..
Still didn’t fix sims eating for 6 hours and drinking for 5 hours.
so the sims 4 harvest moon
Esperando pacientemente a la reacción de Mprin
i cant wait to waste my money on this
The only thing that would’ve made this better was fruit trees. Imagine having a vast orchard of apples and peaches 😍
So… kids can help cook 😃
THERE ARE BUNNIES 😱❤️ instabuy !!!! 🐰
IM SO DUCKING EXCITED FOR THIS 😭😭😭
Oh yes let me buy this and add it to the pile of expansions I have purchased and not played
Fingers crossed it comes out with no bugs.
This looks great but I have a feeling like yet again this pack is actually going to be a huge disappointment when we actually get to finally play...
a pack that we actually wanted? wow.
Agora sim a Fazenda Depressao vai funcionar !
This actually gave a lot of good information, good job Sims team!
The y'all 🤣🤣🤣🤣
3:20 Charles the Evil Chicken Is Back!
adding the simple living trait to every household now...hell yeah. i've been using a mod for it (SCCO) and the problem is, it can't actually restrict sims still going to the fridge and just...purchasing ingredients for meals, it just makes it more expensive. so it being native? hell to the yes. RESTRICTED PLAY PLS
Man, I hope this is good! We’ve all been left disappointed by so many mediocre packs.
Вау..
Finally, Bri'ish sims!
I hope there are traits and aspirations that come in this pack... Honestly they should add like 4 or 5 with this pack, so many amazing options they could go with.
Fantastic! We can do water again! :D Love everything about this pack!!
MY NAME IS CORDELIA GIVE ME MY COTTAGE BACK
Yes! Let me start my Legacy challenge here! My child can grow up in the country side, but leave their hometown and childhood love to pursue University and live life in the city. Become a successful designer only to return to the countryside to fall back in love with their first love, get married and start a family in their hometown.❤
Preordered!
Amazing can’t wait!! 😁
Why y'all sleeping o  the fact that we can FINALLY make proper ponds? 😭
Crumpets, Yorkshire pudding and toad in the hole!  Jesus I might just eat the new expansion 😝😝😝💕💕💕
This looks good
Basically the whole pack lol not worth it
First expansion pack/add-on for the sims 4 since the base game that I preordered!!!
The amount of dirty puns in this omg 😂
I just wish they bugtest before release this time... It looks good, but there are issues with every pack lately, and I'm not about to spend 40USD on damaged goods (again)
pond tool pond tool pond tool pond tool  POND TOOL!!!
Love the FEZ for the chicken! =)
Am I the only one that doesn’t like the commentary, what happened to simlish, don’t assimilate the sims plz
Can't wait to play the new harvest moon game
How’d they get ALL the Sims to look at each other while in a conversation 😂😂 Mine never do that!
Thought you could sneak devonbumpkin at 1:10? We see you Aiden!
So we get burglars then, just not the human kind :D
Someone deleted my comment >.> But anyways excited for this pack!  I guess I leaked something 😂😂 unless it's just hidden somewhere! BUT HELL YEAH! I CANNOT WAIT!
DID YALL SEE THE PONDS
My anxiety is screaming right now
YES
I N e e d   t h i s
This whole trailer was wholesome and comfy and I loved every minute of it 🥰
Join us for a full deep-dive in our upcoming livestream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGnkwx_e8eo
they used the burglar sound effects from the sims 2 in the fox scene... except there are no burglars in the sims 4
41 mins ago? thats pretty early.
1:03 is that Devon Bumpkin :o
I. Want. That. LLAMA!
I got out of bed almost immediately so I can watch Harold on my bigger laptop screen.
This is what seasons and pets should’ve been like
The male sims in this trailer😎
Harold, what an absolute Legend!
Anyone else got like peter rabbit vibes from this pack?
That chicken is wearing a FEZ😍😍😍
Lo ame!!!!
the aminals are so cute 😍 and there is fox! can't wait to have my Sims in cottage living!
The llama is fabulous. Best pack ever! 🥰❤️
Best pack trailer ever
3:24 There's the burglar sound!!!! We are one step closer to get burglars!!!!
the cow looked so cute omg
Why does Harold sound like Philip Schofield 😂😭
THE SOUND EFFECTS LMFAOO
PICNICS!!!!!!!!!
Harold was my dad's name. He died July 3rd. Is this coincidence? Or a sign that this will be a good pack?
0:33 what a shrooooms ))))
pls add body hair in cas. it would be weird if people living off the grid are all hairless
I DONT HAVE ANOTHER SPACE ON MY PCCC😫😫! PACKS EVERY MONTHHH!  p.s really cool pack tho love the farm style 😉
The other trailer suggested the Llama could drive off the fox but that's not here, was it 'movie magic' in the last trailer or just left out from this one?
This looks so good. I am so happy omg.
I already pre-ordered this pack
We need burglars back, it's always fun when you fight them or get them arrested.
... is this really the sims? I haven't been this excited for an expansion pack.. ever!
PONDS! FINALLY!
Excuse me sir Llama man is that a pond
I made an inhuman sound when i saw that off the grid and simple living were *SEPARATE* from lot traits.  SEPARATE, I TELL YOU!!! 🎉🎉
This was a really cute trailer! I may not like The Sims 4 dev team but this was so good!
This is so cute, can you have a picnic on the ground?.
I take issue with the Yorkshire pudding being a standalone meal. That's not how we eat it. It's usually part of a roast dinner.
Comecei a amar lhamas
OH MY GOD!!!! YORKSHIRE PUDDINGS 😍😍😍
I JUST WANT HORSES. PLEASE. HORSES.
Omg im so excited!
lets go lesbians lets go!!
WE HAVE FINALLY POUNDS GUYS
♥♥♥
THEY ADDED YORKSHIRE PUDDINGSNS
my vegetarian side needs this pack
love it!!!!!!!
Meet Harold: He’s an icon, he’s a legend and he IS the moment.
Well, at least it's not a cartoony Barbie voice. It would be nice if there were accents in TS4 or TS5. Or more diverse voices in general. Voice slides ain't it.
OMG more things to do!! I can't wait to get this pack only for the canning station and picnic basket!!
I don't know which sims game it's from, but the burglar alarm playing when the fox comes is iconic
Welp, time to start saving money
In the year 2077 we will get sims 5
3:09 now why would you say it like that...
Can’t wait to see simsie watch this!!
The fox alarm makes me think that we could be getting robbers again
BRITISH LLAMA!!
One of best description script I ever see since "Stay Weirder" Series  Also, God bless modders. Not just one, but all 😁
I'm actually excited for this pack, can't wait to get it at half price
Kind of weird, I think Raccoons also raid coops. It be odd there wouldn't be a star Llama like the Mr. Mayor cat.
Love it so much and have one request. I want nut trees for making ice cream like Pistachio, Chocolate Almond, Black Walnut, Coffee Hazelnut, Pralines n Cream, Butter Pecan, and Pumpkin Caramel Swirl with Toasted Almonds.  Thank you.  You can call this line of ice cream Cow Bell instead of Blue Bell.
omg omg omg this is so fineeee
3:12 what did he just say?! Seems the Sims still has some madness after all
So two rabbit holes with 3 animals. Jam as part of already existing cooking skill (as confirmed by a guru), big vegetables and a picnic basket that you can't use on the floor and the thing recycled from knitting. Is that it? A lot of build/buy and cas and small portions for live mode.  This is why TS4 lacks and always feel so empty despite dlcs. Live mode is generally neglected! If the latest game pack felt like a stuff pack, this expansion feels like a game pack.
Looks kinda like The Village from The Prisoner TV show
Did anyone else notice the pond that wasn’t made with fountain or pool?! Are we getting ponds back??
can’t wait to see all the bugs hidden within this pack 😍😍
omg I can't wait for July 22nd 😥
Did I just see LASAGNA?????? 👁👄👁
OMG YAS!!!
I CANT WAIT!!! GIVE ME NOWWWW
The eggplant joke- 😂
I cant wait to play the pack
Okay this looks good. I was skeptical but I may have to preorder lol
Can’t 22 be here already😭
Harold the British llama😌
Will it be possible to have a pet chicken? 😂😂😂😂 I NEED
Who made the script to this. can i marry you perhaps. love it! (also we want horses implemented-)
Looks boring
I SAW A WATER TOOL I SAW A WATER TOOL THIS IS NOT A DRILL
This give me major Stardew Valley vibes and I love it
The fox coming to rob the coup makes me wonder if there will be a basegame update (re)introducing burglars... 🤔
finally a pack i can look forward to! also love the mention of yorkshire puddings! <3
WAIT YOU CAN WOOHOO IN THE BARN
Finally. A llama in the llama game :')
Я влюбилась в этот набор😍😍😍
FINALLY
Take my coin !
Yeah they made this for the cottagecore gays
Okay, I have to confess that I'm completely in love with Harold 🥰
what about rabbits? 🤭 there was no explanation about rabbits! or the singing birds from the first trailer
3:09 YOU CANNOT TELL ME THAT WASN"T DEFINITELY INTENTIONAL
Jam making, fox, farming 😳  Looks great, can't wait!
0:53 this is my lesbian desire omg
Those eggplants though 👁️👄👁️
As a Yorkshire boy now living in London - this is like going home :)
Is it just me or they should either overhual the Sims 4 assets or make Sims 5. Sims 4 looks like an old eye sore at this point. too dated uggh!
That’s it . Once this comes out  I’ll be naming my lama Harold
Dayum, lots of pets
I can own a cow and idk why this makes me so happy
Вооо, это интересно, не то что этот Star Wars...

Bella & Mortimer Goth as a village couple, knocking on your door giving you homemade jam is a whole other level.
I can’t express how excited I am for this
so basically, sims 4: cottagecore
WHAT ABOUT THE RABBITS???
Y’all are clowns 🙄
Every each video makes me even more excited!
Bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I need this now and now
Think I may be the only one not exited for this pack 🤣
OH MY GOSH
wow I love it
I’ve been wanting something like this for years!!! Now We have farm animals and build a nice country home too!!! Definitely getting this!!!!
Merci pour les sous titres !!!
Im shockingly impressed 😍😍😍😍
This is harvest moon sim ver. BTW, I LOVE IT ❤
Jim's Jam is open for bussines back again! Our Dear Leader will be happy!
I thought we are getting bunnies 😭 They were in the trailer, and this video. But I'm still happy about this pack, and think I'm going to buy it
Jams 🥰 new recipes 😋 dreamy picnic 😍 yeah
Nice, new bugs and even worse frame rate drops.   The best pack you could do is a serious patch.
Ahhh I’m so excited
Beef wellington?!  * chef Ramsay has entered the chat *
do you need cats and dogs?
Finally we can fulfill the cottagecore lesbian dream of raising chickens and baking pie with a tiny girlfriend dressed in florals and lace 🤩✨🏳️‍🌈
It looks so fun but I wish they would talk about the bunnies
O dear I can't wait to play it
Happy birthday to me! I love you sims
does anyone know if i’ll get the bonus content if i buy the pack in a build-a-bundle? i was planning on bundling it with the new interior design pack when it comes out but i dont know if that will disqualify me for the bonus stuff.
eeeeeee
I've been waiting so long for another real Pack with animals!!
am I the only that picks up a lot of innuendos in this video?
Hoping the empty fridge trait brings back the option to grocery shop, especially with farmers markets making their debut
I disapprove the preorder objects
This pack comes out 2 days after my birthday so I have the perfect excuse for my parents to get it for me 😂
Another place to woohoo
I miss having to restock the fridge so that's cool
41-42 was that Jim Pickens at the bar?
I haven’t been excited for sims in a couple of years but I am very excited by this!
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳Cant wait🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Can your lot have multiple challenges going at once? Like off the grid and simple living? I wanna play sims on hard mode
so happy there's no horses lmao  get rekt
Amo esto 💕
hi harold
This I think is their best pack so long
They brought back burglars in the form of foxes
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈
you can create fox-burglar version but cannot create an actual burglar?
Plz plz add fairies 🧚‍♂️🧚‍♀️! The will go sooooo well in this pack!
Magnifique !😍
Guys im crying this just... beautiful
I'll be getting that sassy llama asap! Love his attitude 😅💛
FINALLY I CAN HAVE MY COTTAGECORE DREAMS
I'm in love with this pack! It might be my favourite one now!
Lo necesitoooo ahhh
i am so excited to play this omg
This trailer is so bizarre AND IM HERE FOR IT!!!
I like the idea but graphic texture is so low! Look at the chicks! And what did they think when they were making black of the barn’s inside. It is more beautiful than the other lazy packs but this one also a lazy work!
Finally a pack that has tons of gameplay! I am not a builder and a lot of the other packs didn't have that much to do before you got bored. I am so excited!
But why tf no horses?
This is the most excited I’ve been for a sims 4 game
Ducks and swans!!!
I feel excited about a pack in the sims 4 for the first time in years!
YES YES YES YES YES I WANT NOOOWW ... LOVE THIS SO MUCH !!!!
Omg this pack has so much! I can wait to have a Llama! 🤩🥺
Does anyone know the voice actor? Sounds familiar I think
The Sims 4 is the best game how dare you guys want Sims 5? Look how magical and fantastic this looks! We always wanted this and now they give it to us ...People always said they didn't wanted the Sims 5 but look now..Just a reminder whoever wants the sims 5 is not a long-time player. Sims 4 has so much more to do !! -babies                                         -horses                                       -more challenges                                       -a cars pack                                        -open world                                      - upgrading toddlers and babies let's not forget teenagers                                       -more objects, walls,floors for a house                                       -heights                                         -upgrading adults and older people                                         -romans and greeks pack?                                          -magical creatures (remember the unicorns?)                                        - Zoo pack                                        -...(comment more suggestions here under)
Fans: We want burglars back!  EA: Best we can do is Swiper the Fox.
0:25 ARE WE GETTING NEW PINK HAIR OR IS THAT JUST THE LIGHTING
2:11 HOLD UP kids can cook now?!?! 😲
i love this pack so much i can't eait to play it 🥰🤩
3:09 WHAAAAAAT???!!!
The britishness of the innuendos are on point 👌
definitely need to create harry styles when this pack comes out and make him have a watermelon farm
Simple living lot trait looks dope; super hyped!
Although it does seem like we're getting the plantsim update or fairies in this pack, it looks cute. too bad Jam making is tied to cooking skill like how candlemaking was tied to fabrication
The haircuts>>>
there’s ponds?!? am i the only one seeing that?!
LOVE IT! LOVE IT! Love it soooooooo much 😍😍😍 i can NOT wait any moreeee! 👏🏻
😍😍😍
i would buy it if it weren't 600 :/
this looks fun & i enjoyed the witty, alliterative llama banter. thank you.
I’m so excited for this pack. Finally
when you though that woohoo in a rocket was weird, maxis said, have you ever tried doing it in a barn?
I am so looking forward to this! Been waiting too long for a pack like this! Can finally create an English countryside
Love it 👏 Love it 👏 Love it 👏Love it 👏👏👏👏
SO READY. THIS MADE MY DAY
*the BEST pack.*
acho incrível q the sims 4 não aparece um ladrão no jogo, mas agr vai ter uma raposa ladra man
can you make more expansion packs?  i want a world where there's always spring, same goes for summer and autumn with each their activities, clothes, jobs, cultures and traditions that fits with it (the country where i live we have tullips in spring in volendam and i can name a few of other things too so we have spring climate)  maybe even make an africa continent, i remember on instagram where egypt got showed, it turned out i got too much hoped up on instagram but since sims 4 is still in the running i want a world where it looks like africa (in general) with africa clothes, more lots options, clothes, hairstyles and even jobs (i know we have morroco as kit, i'm aware of that but i want an actual world)  i would definitely like that!!
SWANS??????
This is the first time I have been excited for the sims 4 in a while!
I love this 😍😍😍😍😍😍💖🌹💕🤗🤗🤗Thanknu EA and sims creaters 💖😚
WAIT..... GROCERIES!!!!
They've done a good job with making it look British...I guess the only really pathetic thing to point out is how we don't really have fruit pies like in America, only meat pies, and we say 'shop' instead of 'store'. I couldn't help myself. sorry.
At this point I've accepted that I'll likely be disappointed regardless. I REALLY like want this pack though
This gamepack goes perfectly with the knitting pack and ecoliving 😍
By far the best thing The Sims has ever done! Thank you so much
WATERMELONS!
3:31 Swiper no swipping 😂
Americans be like: “what’s a Yorkshire pudding?????” 😂😂😂😂
Who's the Llama voiced by? It reminds me so much of Richard ayoade/moss from it crowd
The HOB is a good acronym for the name of this Sims 4 World. If you forget what the village's name is, just call it Harold's-Our-Boss! I love that llama. Might aswell get the Expansion.
So no gameplay about rabbits? Come on guys.
Fun fact: Llamas actually don't have upper incisors (the teeth at the front of your mouth) so the llama having upper incisors is not only inaccurate, but also a bit uncanny when you're someone that works with llamas and alpacas :P
CHICKENS!!!!
Why did the choose to have an enlarged eggplant in their garden. AAAAAHHHHHHH LORD JESUS SATAN I REPUKE YOU.
I need this in my life so badly!
I love that we'll have to literally live off of the land, not just off the grid but actually need to find the food.  So fun!!
I showed this to my bf and he was all for it
Honestly, I was expecting way more
WHERE ARE THE HORSEEEEESSSSS
*I remember harvest moon.*
I will buy this and love it! THE NEW TERRAIN TOOL OMG IXMSNHDHDHHDH I'M SO HYPED
DAMMIT I NEED THIS PACK! I GARDEN IN THE SIMS TOO MUCH TO NOT HAVE IT
Make the future in the sims 4 again!
I CANT WAIT I CANT WAIT I CANT WAIT! I haven’t been this excited for a pack since university came out, I’m so proud of the sims team this time! They listened 🥰
I can finally be a cottage core lesbian :D
That one sim at the picnic table looked a whole lot like Devonbumpkin
1:32 Was that a... PLACEABLE POND!?!?!?!?
*Sees a natural pond being made*  *COUGHS UP BREAKFAST*
I'm even more excited about this pack with all these details to ruminate on. Can't wait!
I cannot WAIT another three weeks for this pack 😭… The build/buy, CAS (the little toddler braids omg, and the TWISTS are a look!) and gameplay all look so good I just want to build my perfect lil cottage life! Don’t want to get my hopes up too much but this looks like an epic expansion pack.. thank you sims team!
Wow this with a really good trailer😃😃😃
The fact i love to put my Sims in cottages just says how much i freakin need this pack!!and instead of putting the alarm for foxes,they should've put "swiper no swiping,swiper no swiping" instead LOL!
THE FEZ! The chicken has a fez!
3:28 thank you for not using the burglar sound from ts1 lmao i would've had a heart attack 😭
Those reactions to the lettuce conserve makes me think we're definitely getting liked/disliked food
Was that Sims 2's Burglar music I heard? 👀 Hint at the eventual return of Burglars???
Raposo não pegue raposo não pegue!! Foi mais forte que eu
canning...? really?
Yes! New woohoo place!
my lesbian sims are gonna THRIVE
I saw Bangers and Mash as a plate OMGGGGG
i can't wait!
Aaah i really cant wait to play with it, everything looks amazing 🥺
Any Stardew Valley vibes, anyone?
Is it just me or does the lighting look a little weird?
Tellement pressé d'avoir ce pack ! Et de créer ma propre famille à la ferme 🥺
I love Harold
Speechless 😶😮
"Don't fly the coop just yet, this..... 😳..... y'aalll"  Me: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 That caught me off guard!
sims team i think this pack is really cool and i’ve been waiting for things like this but i am BEGGING you to go back to the old style of trailer cause these ones where a sim/llama talks to the viewer are SO awkward
I’m not someone who wanted farming and I probably won’t buy this. But I gotta say, this pack looks incredible !!!!! I’m excited for everyone who buys it and I hope it lives up to your expectations !!
WAIT STITCH WITH REFERENCE???
UM GROCERY STORES ✨💕
the toddlers hair omg- adorableee
Horses...shaking my head
Triste que os coelhos não poderão ser controlados, tipo eles são domesticados hoje em dia... mas, a gameplay parece um tema interessante para jogar por um tempo, até enjoar... Cadê os cavalos EA? Não basta o presidente roubando, vocês também estão querendo arrancar dinheiro desnecessário dos nossos bolsos? 😓
I want it now. 😭
Voice is too awsome!
Cow Girl!
First time in awhile I've been excited for a pack. THANK YOU EA.
1:30 A pool! FINALLY!!!
This pack has so much stuff and playability to it, it looks great!
Cannot wait to turn off the unlimited fridge and have some realism 😁😁
Jam making, cross stitch, cows, Llama, chickens, fox, family cooking, pond tool, everything most simmers have asked for-is ALL coming in 21 days time!!! Cannot wait!!
1:31 Custom Water, please be in the official version.
​having wanted the chicken coop, canning table, and cows from the sims 3 premium store and never being able to get them i seriously have like 10 years worth of excitement rn lol
I'm so excited for this pack but I hope this isn't another dream home decorator that it's just nice to look at for 5 minutes and I never look at it again! But great job, I love Harold! I love how the world looks and the build buy and gameplay looks very promising!!!
10/10 trailer 👏👏👏
Best thing about this trailer honestly? The fact that they used the Sims 2 burglar music @ 3:24 ❤️❤️❤️
Did I hear the sims 2 burglar music, or am I crazy?
Did he just say "cow shiz"..?
One of the first in 547 XD
SWIPER NO STEALING!! 😂
aaand que the lilsimsie post
this is indeed a very necessary pack i’ll hand it to them
Good stuff
If I can play with foxes or cows and can interact with lakes I'm going to be the happiest person in the world 💛 I'm so in love with this new expansion.
ive been thinking about this pack ever since the trailer was officially announced. i am beyond excited, it’s been such a long time since i’ve been THIS excited for a sims pack. i’m talking since the sims 3!!!
It's so cute! I really like this trailer.
time to live out my cottagecore dream through my sims
sims harvest moon pack! nice job EA!
So excited! And I hope we get burglars and alarms soon in the base game, if this pack has fox burglars and fox alarms 😂
Ahh Beautiful :)
OH MY GOD 😍
yeah ok im paying full price for this o ne
Tipping??? can we tip cows like in Sims 3? to get MILK SHAKES? That would be sooo awesome   July 22 hurry!!!!!
Sad we have no horses and fairies but I like the other stuff
Oh my God this looks incredible I’m close to tears
Did anyone else notice the strawberry dress? 😳
IM SO EXCITEDDDDDDDD
What a lovely trailer!
AVATAR                                                                                 IS BEST                                        OK
I love it sooo much! ♥ :D
so excitedd!! if only they add horses, this pack would be perfect!
llamas having beef with cows, we love to see it
3:25 Wow, they actually brought back the nostalgic sound when someone trespasses (in this case a fox). This is gonna bring back nightmares xD
AMAZING EA
Can you have multiple lot challenges going on at once? I'd wanna do simple living and off the grid at the same time to get the full old timey cottage experience 🤔
3:09 DID HE JUST-
YORKSHIRE PUDDINGS!!! The best food ever
I've waited for ponds for so long omg🙌  will there be functional bridges too?
i haven't really touched the Sims 4 since before the Star Wars pack, but i'm sold! i hope it's as good as the trailer makes it look!!  <3 <3
OMG THIS IS SO CUTE
its IMPOSSIBLE to not get this pack, just look at the chickens 😩😩
IS IT JULY 22ND YET
Great for decades challenge.   Very excited
Juste ENORME !!
Do you still need sims University to be able to ride the bike?
💳💥💳💥💥💳💥
Did you guys saw the foxes animation and song played when they come for the chickens and the upgrade to protect them with alarms? BURGLARS ARE COMING BACK TO THE SIMS!!!!!!
Best pack ever
A petition to launch cottage living earlyyyy!!!!
This looks amazing omg
😍😍😍
YAYYYY
THIS IS AMAZING
I would die for this lama
I love this omg
I'm not gunah complain alot but I wish there was some like fake inside to the barn or some kinda door the whole disappearing into darkness looks so weird
I want this so bad!!!!!
I’m looking forward to this one.
I CAN'T WAITTTTT....OUT ALREADY!!!!!
The voice over is so annoying. Overdramatic and not natural. Kinda british accent too which is really annoying.
honestly was that sim based on Aden? aka devonbumpkin?
Brooooo I freaking want this pack already 😭 I want to play with it, I want my llamas 🦙
This looks like so much fun!  YOU CAN MAKE YOUR FRIDGE RUN OUT OF FOOD OMG
This gives me Hobbit vibes and I like it!! ♥️
"My, what big eggplants you have sir".
Harold: "This is the animal shed, this is where the animal eat" Me: :D Harold: "Sleep" Me: :D Harold: "And die here of course!" Me: D: Harold: "And this is the perfect place to have a romantic gestures" Me: :D
I’m going to play out my Wuthering Heights fantasies. Heathcliff gets the land AND the girl now!
YESSSWWW
This and Peter Rabbit part 2...coincidence. I will consider to buy this seeing my TS3 got so many glitch now, I have to re-install TS4 back..
I"m unable to wait 21 days for this to come out
That reaper clip absolutely **hurt** me
"Is cottage living the lifestyle for you?" YES, IT FRICKIN IS!
Im eating jam
omg
Australia Voice very cool 😎
I'm so excited
1:08 is that DevonBumpkin? :D
that accent is shite
Diddly squat farm shop here we come
I only play TS2, but I got TS4 for free a while ago. And I'm considering buying this pack. It looks so fun!
How cute! I’m so glad I preordered!
As already knew about all this stuff already
Well I know what I'm doing for the rest of the evening
Thanks you all so much! The cow is so cute I’m crying ✋😩
I love the sims 4
MALE CLOTHES STILL SUCK WHY
This might be the best pack yet
this is.... AMAZING
IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS PACK
Yes. *pulls wallet out*
PARALIVES LIVES
Love it! 💚
amazing video  :)
lol
is that the aMaazing?
Is the fox a hint for burglars?🦊😲
Are you saying we can WOOHOO where the cows live💦👀
Why are the textures so incredibly fuzzy?
Male simmers: EA has been introducing new packs with female sims, we want representations too!  EA: hold my male llama
I hope the quality of the milk that the cow gives depends on their mood that would be cute
This was so cute…
So how is that with the foxes going to be? Are they just NPC-animals that you can access or do they cooperate with Cats and Dogs?
Was holding out for fairies to be mentioned... it’s a shame that now they probably won’t fit into any future packs so we may never have them
Omg we do get pie competitions! YEEEES!
This is a pack I’ll definitely be getting without it being on sale! 😊
"Let's assume you made the horrible mistake of choosing cow." the nerve lmao
Disappointed that cows are once again portrayed as milk machines that automatically produce milk without being pregnant. Hate the spread of misinformation.
So I know I'm in the minority on this, but it really feels like cut content from Eco Lifestyle/Seasons (living off the grid in the country). Excited for group cooking with the update though!
You gonna tell me you can only get Chickens, Lamas and Cows? What’s with Pigs? :/
I bought this when the trailer came out. I’ve never pre purchased a game, that says a lot. Can’t wait to play (:
it’s great to see so many classic British things I grew up with now represented in The Sims! ✨
That burglar tease 🤔🤪
@lilsimsie
Omg I can't wait the animals are so cute its alot I seen that I can't wait to do with the kids I'm excited to have real pumpkins we can plant and eggplants too
RAINBOW COWS
Harold is all of our new best friend. He is an icon and needs to protected at all costs
I'm SO ready for this!!! As soon as it comes out, I'm throwing my money at my computer because I NEED A FRICKIN CHICKEN

It's going to be my favorite pack after Seasons ❤

I never preordered any pack on the day that it was announced and I'M SO DAMN HAPPY I DID! Canning! Cross-Stitch! Cooking and gardening with the kids! Ponds! Cows! Lamas! Chickens!

Love how The Sims has been more interactive with us this Summer then ever! This has been one of the biggest things I’ve missed about this franchise so glad the interactivity is back! 💚💚💚

Since the video is named "Llama tell you about cottage living", does that mean we have llama stuff in The SiMs now??? I mean other than some cheat code or maybe even modification.
*This will go down in history as the best expansion pack EVER.*
booked the day off work for this 😎 my dream ep!!
I keep forgetting this pack exists.
What a pleasant b-day Surprise
How about Llama spits on this sims4 garbage and proceeds to talk about Sims 5

Excited for this! We also need bands, more sports and (Italian) generations😊
I can't wait 7 hours 😭😭

Please fix DHD 🥺🥺
I can't play the Sims because I'm waiting for this pack to come out. I don't like the long wait. I won't be able to play until it comes out, because any game play I do is unsatisfactory!
