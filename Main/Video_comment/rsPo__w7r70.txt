Wish I could buy some stuff from your website not doing very well I'm homeless at the moment... Maybe one day I'll be able to do that.... Watching your videos cheers me up ive watched them all but always re-watching.... I'm a super fan I love you jeffree  Love your biggest fan         Amanda Jackson
ugh that hair is gorgeous
“Just wanted to drop a small collection”
we need another launch like this :(  more highlighters for sureeee
I want a DESSERT themed pallette / LAUNCH  PLEASE!!❤️🧁🍧
omg i bot 1 of your plaits 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
FATAL ERROR!…AS YOU SAY INSANE!… Definition: in a state of mind which prevents normal perception, behavior, or social interaction; seriously mentally ill. "he had gone insane" Jeffree being the YOUTUBER of the century, I think asking for a gun can hurt your popularity.  And this even if it is the most beautiful Beretta. It can inspire teens and your fans to do more… Here in Canada, firearms are prohibited. I sincerely believe that there is a certain limit that should not be exceeded.  Yes, I understand that this luxury item may be for your safety but it is not a toy.  Having a bodyguard would be nice, but showing your gun, in my opinion, is beyond comprehension.  I hope your fans don't think like me...Not a good move for your image!…  ERREUR FATALE!… Come tu le for si bien INSANE definition@(dans un état d'esprit qui empêche une perception, un comportement ou une interaction sociale normaux ;  gravement malade mentalement.  "il était devenu fou" Jeffree étant le YOUTUBER du siècle, je crois que le fait d’exiger un pistolet peut nuire à y’a popularité. Et ce même si c’est le plus beau des Beretta.  Ceci peut influencer les adolescents et tes fans à en faire de suite…  Ici au Canada les armes à feu sont prohibées.  Je crois qu’il y a une certaine limite qu’il ne faut pas dépasser. Oui je comprends que cet objet de luxe puisse être pour ta sécurité mais ça n’est pas un jouet. Que tu aie un bodyguard serait convenable mais afficher ton arme à feu selon mon avis ça dépasse l’entendement. Souhaitons que tes fans ne pensent pas comme moi…
This is one of my favorites I love watching Jeffery star he always brings his pallets and reveals to the next level
I love you ❤️😘
What the fuck are you a girl or a boy this man is crazy 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Y'know y'all hate on him so fucking much but like sis... He's one of the most successful cosmetologists in the world. Spend your energy on doing something fun and productive
My son's bday I've missed so many of your launches I'm sad I want the pricked palette I'm not a huge red fan but I love corals and nudes I'm boring lol
I wonder if anyone else caught Jeffree missing _OUCH_ while swatching the Mini Blood Sugar? Lol. He completely skipped right over it.
The thumbnail reminds me of the devil himself😈😱
I love the ice cold one
omggg you're stuuuunning
when you have your head phones on at full speed and you hear him screaming and the star thingy
Packaging for the cavity is cheap
FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST, WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE  EVERLASTING LIFE IN HEAVEN FOREVER AND EVER. John 3:16 Bible....THE RAINBOW🌈THRONE OF SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TREE OF LIFE, Revelation 4 and Revelation 22 Bible. And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.🔥This is the second death. Revelations 20 bible.... ❤️I SAW A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. 2 Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 3 And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. 4 And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” 5 Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.”❤️ 6 And He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. 7 He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son. 8 But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone,🔥which is the second death.
Hey🐍
👋🐨💝
Stunning!
the fact that kids dont know what vcrs are, is sad.
Jeffree Star looks like fruit punch
i cant watch it, he is a pure noise, absolutely annoying
Jefree I have made a heavenly oud based scent for you..one day if we meet up"in Gods will" it will be my gift to you hun.
Hair is gorgeous!!
https://youtube.com/channel/UCfCAuMBnEmQOQblAyff0p0w
I honestly was thrilled to watch this when I saw it. Idk how i missed it. Judge me all you want queens and kings but I'm a dentist geek. I literally am so interested in dentist stuff so i'm pretty impressed with Jeffrey nice job. =)
MY VIDEO WILL GIVE YOU A CAVITY BECAUSE ITS TOOOOO JUICY 😩 it’s also 18+ 😩

Right🐒💝
👌好气质 👌好时尚审美 超棒 真的太棒了🌟👏🌟👏🌟……完美！
👌👌👌……完美！
OMG It launch’s on my birthday! 🥳😍😭🥰
I liked this statement: "what a 52 dollars pallete is supposed to look like".
Omg love this. I can’t pull off reds.. so sad👎
Over money not set life 😏
Do a look with the mini we can  just be absolutely insane about! Please
Your so fucken beautiful

I love me a book worm queen xoxo Stephen King reference I’m in love
Fantastic video,.aroma from heaven
I need "CANDY JOINT" by its self please. I'm in love with that color.
I can’t with the fact that he missed one shadow in the mini while swatching
💕
Maybe all those thumbs downs on your makeup videos is perhaps these peeps are not into makeup? I wear very little it any but I love these videos. They make me happy!! 😊 😊 😊
Your enthusiasm into every makeup video I've seen is sooo surreal. I absolutely love and appreciate it and you QUEEN!
Make Firestarter, Suckerpunch,Heartbeat, and Bite my tongue full size
My makeup collection is ridiculous but this collection is my favorite 😍  currently have swatches from the vault all over my arm 🥰🥰🥰🥰 . Which collection should I get next !? Help!!
Only the red glitter swatch I can see the rest blends in with his hand
🥰😍🤩
I have a huge question can someone please answer me. In this video it shows the new anniversary edition of the Blood Sugar Palette WITH PLASTIC SHADOW AND MIRROR PROTECTION. I did not get either when I ordered the original. I contacted the customer service about it. Is this normal? Is anyone else experiencing this???
Light pink lipgloss 💕💗
I wonder if Jeffery ever donated proceeds for this pallet to either JDRF OR ADA using diabetic references for make up making profits off of someones way of life is wrong if your not bringing positive awareness or helping to find a cure. If anyone know if Jeffery has let me know.
Creative. Especially since you know, due to the lack of dental care cause covid, gums will bleed in the dentist chair. Lol
FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST,   WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE  EVERLASTING LIFE IN HEAVEN FOREVER AND EVER. JOHN 3:16 BIBLE.....        THE RAINBOW THRONE OF SON OF GOD JESUS CHRIST AND THE TREE OF LIFE Revelations 4 and Revelations 22 Bible.   1After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, “Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this.” 2Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne set in heaven, and One sat on the throne. 3And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance  like an emerald.    4Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white robes; and they had crowns of gold on their heads. 5And from the throne proceeded lightnings,  thunderings, and voices. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. 6Before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back. 7The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living  creature was like a flying eagle.   8The four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying:...... “Holy, holy, holy,.. Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!” 9Whenever  the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, 10the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying: 11“You are worthy, O Lord, To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will they exist and were created..
Idfk how this dude has more money then pewdiepie

❤️❤️
And I'm living for this❤
The way he does say obsessed now I am obsessed with thisssss! BAM
The world is insane.
OMG!!!! WAWWWWW :D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bro what are you....
Please oh please oh please review the Prince Collaboration by Urban Decay!!!!!!
Ur bad
Love it all only have to get the sweats
LOVE your love of packaging. I, too, have a fixation with packaging.
*WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THE WIG?* I NEED ittttt......
that mini blood sugar is calling me.. LEO vibe
can we talk about how the cavity palette has 4 renamed colors from the mini palette 😐 "snatched"
We need a neon pallette from jeffree imagine how glowy it would be
I bought a Blue Blood pallet  And I am so upset. I ordered the box with the clasp and received a little card board box. One of the eyeshadows are broken and it barely has any pigment. I saved for 2 months for this. I'm disabled and this was a lot of money for me. I just sat and cried when I opened the package.
this guy is a survivor everything he's been through I wish I had his mental strength.. ❤🤘
I don’t like stuff he did in the past but his makeup is AmAzInG
I love  They names
Jeffree incentiva a usar maquillajes que no son testeados en animales si los influencers dejan de usar dichos productos las marcas dejarían de lastimar animales. Es horrible ver como los animales mueren y sufren por esos productos pongan su grano de arena incentivan a comprar marcas que están libre de maltrato animal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgJa7cLs35M
Irrelevant
The creasing foundation...
That hair! Omg!😍
Doesn't Jeffree look like Madam Red from Black Butler....even the setup🙄
Omg. I love it! I cant stand how beautiful the wisdom red is, its stunning and those lipsticks. no words just STUNNING!
We need a Zodiac Sign inspired palette full of duochromatics extra metallic shades !  IT SHOULD BE CALLED "THE SIGN" OR "ZOODIAC SIGN"
Justina Valentine? Is that you? Got dayum
Madame Red from black Butler 😄❤
Goat 🐐
the only brand I trust now is theirs ha😈
The hoodie and joggers 😍
Oh great tomorrow I go to the dentist lol
Me need orange palette
We need a pink palettes
I don't understand people that open Jeffrey's videos, just to write hate comments   Like you don't like him , don't watch
My brother is asking if ur hair is a wig;-;
God loves you, Trust Him and pour all your cares upon Him. Talk to Him, you can lean and depend on Him. We all need Him, call on Him, accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and savior ( Romans 10:9) repent all your sins and ask Jesus to come into your life. Pray daily, read your bible and get even closer to the Lord. Forgive those who trespass against us, let love flow in your heart. Each day God allow us is a blessing,  be thankful unto Him❤
I love the look on your candy joint
I just got my cavity’s filled 😭😭😭
Now on to JS Nail polish! 😉🙏🤞
YIKES!!
Has anyone who’s ordered the lipstick vault received it yet?? If so how fast did you get it?
Wow comments stayed up on this vid but you couldn’t handle the heat on your other release, huh 🤔😂🤣
Pete Burns, Sex Drive
Recycled bullshit. He looked far better when it was first released. Shame on anyone buying any of his products. I admit they're quality but there are alternatives.
That wig is sikkening ❤️
Here for the makeup
Jeffrey many of your products contain Mica.  It comes from  India and its hard to separate what Mica comes from dangerous child mining and legitimate Mica companies because the companies buy the children's Mica for next to nothing and mix it with there's.  Many of these mining children die digging for Mica.  Some other make up companies are helping these children in India go to school and stop working in these dangerous mines. Would you be willing to help the situation in India????

So happy to see you
I am turning 60 this year and just by chance I came across a Jeffery Star video. Now I’m hooked. I bought some f mascara and som lip gloss. You Jeffery have gotten me excited about being beautiful again. Im crying because I haven’t felt beautiful and I have not worn makeup fir 2 years. You remind me of my best friend from high school. Anyway I love you and thank you for reminding me that I am beautiful and with certain colors a 60 year old can feel pretty again. Nobody has come out with makeup for older ladies maybe we should! Anyway honey thank you!
Jeffree star cosmetics open palette
I am mesmerised with this collection... especially the vault.... everything
Winner 🏆
jefree i use your pumpkin pie lipstick my mom love it sooo much my mom age is 36 and i am 11

Everything is pretty 😩😩 Wanttt 😢
His skin looks terrible. He's aged in dog years recently.
Why theres no gingivitis shade??😕
Are you an old man?
ول عراقيه
I just ordered this pallet!!! I’ve always wanted to try your products but never had the money to get them.. so I finally had the money and ordered this pallet, a few of your lip scrubs, and also one of your nude lip kits!! I can not WAIT for them all to get here !!!! 💚💚💚❤️❤️❤️
Absolutely love everything in this collection EXCEPT that sweatsuit.  Looks like it's faded and blotchy like it got messed up getting washed. Love everything else tho
I absolutely love him. He is real as they come. Love that he is such a Diva!!!!
I’m so excited. I ordered the bundle with the Blood sugar pallet and the mini and the highlighter pallet. I’m gonna be so excited once they come in. I also ordered the Creamated pallet, I’m sure I’m gonna cry in happiness once they come in the mail. I finally have the resources to get the makeup since I’ve been wanting to try your stuff for years.
Он напоминает мне чокнутого продавца пылесосов, который ходит по квартирам и с энтузиазмом пытается продать дичь
the vault packaging is so sickening
発色良くて色も沢山あって可愛い！🥺これは欲しい(*´◒`*)
❤️❤️❤️❤️I LOVE IT!❤️❤️❤️❤️ 💋
He do he looking like my period tho 😂
这里有个老实人大家快来孤立他
can i play as you in roblox brookhaven
The mirror is the polish flag🤣
So this basically became the new version of the QVC channel
Meh 😒
Wow jeffrees getting old you can really see all the old Botox and filler in this video
I have been trying to place an order for a month but the site won't let me put it in my cart and customer service doesn't answer. Guess they don't want my business.
Why all the hate lol
It’s funny how people are saying stuff like ‘hOw Is He StIlL rElEvAnT’ um... you do realise you commenting that doesn’t help right?
He would be about 75 percent less annoying if he didn't yell every 14 words for no god damned reason
💖💖💖
We need blood lust mini tooooooo🤧🤧🤧
You are the QUEEN of makeup. Much continued success to you
Woah
i’m so happy for you ❤️❤️‼️
Ohh damn i thought the blood sugar mini palette cover was that red on white, but then he opened it and it looked cheap 😩.. the box cover was better tbh
Jeffree i really wanted to get fuck proof, its sold out! 😞
This is the most soft feminine look you have ever had love❤️💋
love how ppl love to criticize hate to JS like gurl work on your career, we all know that youve been showering yourselves with his scandals and flaws just to throw something at  him/her.  yall been in the shadows struggling what to eat everyday, and most of u are still living the same roof with your mother. so gurl go wash dishes and gargle alcohol.
❤️❤️❤️🥵🥵🥵💋💋🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
OMG🤩🤩🤩
A yellow palette omf
Love you so much
Crappy stuff as usual!!! Voldemort will gradually go down, nothing lasts forever!!!
My favorite of all 😍
Who else read Icing IV as Icing 4?
bough a highlight pallet and it took the money outta my bank account but shows i didn’t buy it hella pissed
I like your makeup products, it looks really cool
I had no idea the new collection was even released
My first time watching it be like: " WHAT HAPPENED TO HER VOICE"" "Wait is this a man or a woman"?????????? O_O
mini package screams heart lol Jeffrey Let the healing begin and already dreaming here of a collaboration with  west coast and east coast and your next launch Bamm Joan Rivers Can we talk?
Dont understand why it have to be so expensive… its not like nobody is buying it 🥺 #justbrokemethatwantAsugarPalett
Can't wait for this comment to get deleted!
Ivy looks cool guys dig that too
Could Have used spme glitter vibes on the pink latex one
They are basically really good lipstick colors on that mini
He seemes like he needs a big wow congrats
Is it me or did he skip the caramel brown color that's on the top row all the way to the right (3rd color).?!?!?!?!?!?!
Me encanta todo lo que haces eres el mejor
so you had to put your own photo on the pallet and cant hire underappreciated illustration/design artists to help you with a... more creative... cover concept? how bland.
I don't care about how toxic Jeffrey is ,his makeup is incredible
Don't really keep up with this stuff, but how interesting that the once dominate jeffreestar is now MILLIONS of subscribers behind James Charles like almost 10 MILLION LESS. He is either doing something wrong OR Karma is catching up. Just saying.
I HAVE THE SAME INHALER OMG
y'all mad that he been posting mostly launches, but they are still entertaining and y'all forget how mf BUSY this man is.
he's controversial but he doesnt care. no such thing as bad press... but his PRODUCTS THO !!!!!
We want pink! 🥺
Never in my life have I seen you without nails done
OMG sweetener is literally the color of my car!!
Ewwww
I wonder why people stll follow him
Why does jeffrees face look different. Something is different.i love his makeup. That blush highlighter is nice.
folks we NEED to make this flop. Jeffree will only listen when his bank account is attacked.
The bite my tongue liquid lip looks gorgeous to me.
Just a little opinion .. don't put anyone's or your picture on the packaging .. I loved your other packagings ..but this just ain't it, very tacky , not a fan of it at all . Just my opinion it's still his business anyways -__-
it's the fake enthusiasm for me
R these lippies available solo or do u have to get the vault? I have never bought ne of his stuff and wanna try some. I fell in love with the lippie colors cant afford the whole thing.
LOve you jeffree star 😍😍😍
Hello hello 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I think i read some comments earlier😳 i cant see them now 😱😱😱😱
Man that wig looks 'snatched' 🔥
so what your running out of ideas ?
we need a pink palette
More creativity please?
Nice, so when am I being sent a replacement mini orgy palette it’s been about 6 months of me being told over and over again I would
Im lost on youtube
Omg get rid of the kids screaming “yay” in your videos! It’s so off putting! Makes sense if jojo siwa had it on her videos or those grown ass adults who play with toys on YouTube,  but not when a legendary cosmetic brand owner uses it. If you need an appropriate applause sound effect, maybe a lion roaring or even a “cha-Ching” sound...but those kids? Ick. It’s strange.
U should do a pink palette ik blood sugar has a lot of pinks but it’s more red so u should do a pallet with a lot of different shades off pink 💞💞
It's so entertaining and beauty
I like how he dresses up for every theme
He reminds me of Jacqueline hill only uploading when a new product of theirs come out miss the old jefree
I just got mine in the mail last week and it’s honestly my first pallet like this and I’m in love I jumped on the site at just the right time and a perfect first pallet for me
Go to RossyMcMichael  Channel!!!!
I haven't watched jefree for a year..... is  it just me or he kinda looks different???
Umm I got 2 of these bundle for my birthday 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 my brother got me a bundle for my work kit and my sister got me one for myself 🥰🥰🥰. Every product is 🔥. My top favorite item is still the Magic concealer, it’s hands down the best concealer I love it!!
Ok whomever did the second camera needs to stop spazzing out
Jeffery, a suggestion for you is your own energy drink pallet! A name suggestion is Energy!
... tbh Jeffrey . Why . . U can stop this isn’t what most pple want  . Now do pink or something . Do mascara which u said ur doin I’m not that thrilled over but ok  . Nail polish . Lashes . DAMN ID LOVE TO SEE SOME LASHES . I liked ur bags with Shane tho . Usually u wow pple this ain’t wow . U only post when u release shit now I mean . U did one review 🤷🏻‍♀️
I have a cavity rn this just reminds me that imma have to go to the dentist next week T^T
I need this.. all that swatting. Got me hooked
I wish you could show us how to put your new palette on.. and not look like a melting clown.. th hats what happens to me.  I want dark colors but maybe I am too old.  42
VCR lol ya I'm from VCR LAND.. I'm so excited to catch up with all new videos..I had no ideal you been back.. I don't know how I got unsubscribe..because I been waiting to watch I think since October or so..
Whyyyy are these colors looking so CHALKIY and underwhelminng?! The quality has TANKED, and it’s so easy to tell (spelling wrong on purpose due to the deleted comments based off key words)
DO PINK
It’s sad to see how your channel became just one  big ad
You don’t even TRY to hide the fact that you ALWAYS post an unrelated video, trying on makeup, and then - within the SAME WEEK - out pops out another Jeffree star cosmetics launch. Then you disappear again for months - you post one random video, and then right after you post another launch. It’s actually sad to see how you used to be a REAL BIT*H - that didn’t use your fame to push cosmetics sales. You were a makeup influencer who just happened to promote his company. NOW - your channel is just one big ad
He said that he sold out but he never did.
You ruined it with using your face on the actual palette.
i feel like he’s upping the hype because of his sales dropping
something seems off
Gorgeous palette...but u did forget to do one of the swatches for the mini. However I feel as if people really want to see it then just go to his og reveal video and see the swatch there...I mean it IS one of the og shades.
You should be ashamed
https://youtu.be/jiQTjxpwBPQ
Please restock your Orgy Mini! I refuse to buy second hand because I don't think it's right that someone profits off someone else's makeup just because they could afford to buy multiples at a launch. But I'm dying for this palette 😭  Also, as a single mom of two, I definitely think you should come out with more mini's. Not just because of the affordability. But lord knows mom's don't have much space to carry makeup out with them when their kids think they need to take half the house on a grocery store trip.
I  just got my order! Can’t wait to try everything, I love the ‘cavity’ theme. I am a dental hygienist and ❤️❤️❤️.
Infomercial circa 93 feel
Repent sinners
Tongue Pop instead of Prick would of made it PUUURRRFECT! It’s still so beautiful tho♥️
I’ve been living under a rock. Why is everyone mad at him ?
His product is better than kyle
You forgot to swatch the camel brown shade in the mini palette :(
Gigantic pours 😳
It’s called fairy floss
The pallete looms like a nintendo ds
y'all give so much attention to someone you "hate."
you seem like you are trying so hard to sell this. RIP JSC.
Jeffree,  I am hoping one day i will grab your attention and allow me the opportunity to be on your team in any way possible! In the biggest fan and Cali is my dream home.
You’re really just paying for a white packaging, one new shade, and highlighters that kinda make no sense whatsoever, and liquid lipsticks that are overpriced imo
You are blinding us with so much red, Jeffree!
Why is everyone being so negative? Ffs.
Why don’t y’all just stop?!?! Oh my god it’s sad how y’all think your hero’s then go and attack people for no reason. Stop being hypocritical, and become a better person.
I honestly think this re launch is super adorable and cute. I may purchase some of these my next paycheck.
Omg I need the mini and the highlight palette
I think Jeffree is going through it right now. I think he’s depressed and tbh these comments probably aren’t helping.
I want this whole collection. Now.
now that my blood sugar is 300+...
That red and white mirror is literally so ugly, that gradient is to harsh that it just looks like you dipped it in paint lmao
All these lip paints got me in a good mood😊
I know I'm late by a couple of weeks, but as soon as this video popped up, I stopped my Bible Study to watch this, I know that's bad huh But I just needed to take a break and this is the perfect reason, I love Jesus tho!
People are making smartass comments about how unimaginative this new launch is - so are we gonna ignore the fact that there's 16 NEW shades of liquid lip?! Stop hating. It's not a good look on anyone.
Why did you just delete that video 😭😭😭😭
Jeffree can you link all of your bags from the closet tour
Whether you like Jeffree or not, it doesn’t take a genius to watch this and see he is struggling. He may have done some bad things but what happened to be kind? Leave him be man
I would kill for a Rainbow or an LGBTQ themed palette!
Do you sell in stores or just on your website?
Where is the new video????????????
Why I don't get any of your notifications. I have all the bells 🔔 on its been like that for all 2020. What wrong with you tube, they are pushing your Chanel down I guess. If you are any wonder or concern about views. This is why at least for me.
Just another palette with a different shade of color...Nothing inventive.
🇵🇱 - polish flag
please come back  i want to see your video
I'm in love! Ordered the Cavity and Mini Blood Sugar!!

I GOT COLOUR BLIND AFTER WATCHING THE VIDEO 🟥♥️♦️🍎🌹🍒🎈🎀🏮💄🔴
Rose gold😭 seriously?
get a life
I may not be a fan of jeffree, but I joined this channel for makeup tips and he is an amazing makeup artist and his own makeup line is sick. If you care too much about the drama happening around you probably lack something in your life
Jefree star : we have reviewed thousands of products here in youtube. Number of videos in his channel : 329 🤣
His lips look so cheap for some reason?
GO DELETED COMMENTS GO!!! <3
I can’t wait I can’t get it tho
He doesn't have to keep shit talkers comments on his shit. Maybe he's just a positive person and doesn't want that bad energy when he's trying to do something positive. I think he's awesome!
Jeffrey Star! Please tell me you will have your own reality show soon?!💋💕🔥
Remember when true religion jeans and bedazzled everything was in? Yea..re invent or cease
Views are down.  Voice is pitched up..and not authentic..he is literally acting like..himself...idk dude...maybe u should start interacting with ur fans here in the comments...ur vibe is just OFF and ur just not cool or interesting anymore....ur NOT evolving...
He’s just not as edgy as he used to be. He’s more a salesperson now more than an artist.
ZZZZZZZZZ zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Why is this nigga not down with shane
We love how you ✨delete✨ Comments. So professional 🥲
Would love too see you do a mini blue blood too💙💙💙
*No.*
He comes across as very aggressive in this. You can tell he's ticked off.
I feel bad for Jefferey, goes to say that everything becomes a has-been.
غيع
I guess being EVIL pays off.
U look like a skeleton ngl
Have yet to see a positive comment....   Lol
Precious Pink, or pandemonium pink palette! Brainstorming that idea would rock! I would love to see a pink palette with a range of colors on the scale!
What color are you going to hype for the insane amount of money?
Diabetic Sugar palette mini!!! So Astronomical
He is man  trying to act like a woman.  No not okay.
When Jesus say yes nobody can’t say no
YESSSS HOW EXCITING‼️‼️‼️
this mirror looks like a flag of Poland :D
poo why you imortal????

His energy is so aggressive in this video. 🩸❤💄💉💋

Wyoming’s water is not doing your appearance good sis 💅

omggggggggggggggggg i loveeeeeeeeeee uuuuuuuuuuu
me looking for the hate comments so i can like them : 👁👄👁
Hi Jeffree!! I have so many questions for foundations. Did you come out with one??? 🤔 What's the best one to use for dry ass skin???  I'm in Az and its serious here!!
He didn't even swatch all nine shades in the "new" palette. He never swatched Ouch.
Notice how he has to release more often cuz he isn't making as much from each
I love you jef!!.. But certain colors are not you anymore.. Makes you look older..
Do you ladies were this kind of  red colors like daily? To work, going out?
I know it’s old as hell! But can you PLEASE review Boy De Chanel for your “masc” viewers lmao
Omg I am a big fan
Seems Nobody cares what he selling but reading the comments
I can’t believe that with all the stuff that went down with the hair stylist stuff, and you are out here acting fake when you can actually try becoming a better person, Not only for yourself but for your fans. You are always posting apology videos but the whole point of the apology is to actually make up for what you have done and learn from it. But to me it seems you don’t really want to grow from you’re mistakes.
Please leave the internet and never come back
Jefree i want a tummy tuck ..
I've always been obsessed with red eyeshadow.  So pretty.
YOUR VOULT
SHOW US A VIDEO OF YOIR NEW BAG ROOM
Who else noticed jefreee is dramatically losing subs he went from 16.9 to 16.6 😅
Anyone else think his makeup looked kinda different like kinda dark for his skin and packed on
I've never bought any of his products before, but that "Bite My Tongue" lip shade is calling my name.
Even a blind chimpanzee can see what’s going on in the world right now, how does a virus with a 97% - 99% survival rate manage to shake the world. A PCR testing system that is only 7% accurate giving out 93% false positives. Masks that are causing bacterial pneumonia, severe chest infections, tuberculosis and legionnaires. Not only that but to win your freedom back you have to get a vaccine that contains MRNA (which has never been used on humans before) it is also genetically modifying and messes with peoples DNA aswell as no liability clause if people die from it (which they are) Also the Lateral flow tests are sterilised with ethylene oxide which is highly toxic, causing blood cancers and other severe illnesses. So what I really want to know Jeffrey is have you sold your soul like the rest of the celebrities or are you going to be on the right side of history. It’s still time to speak the truth, god is always watching! The great reset is coming and this affects every single one of us!
Oh you're still uploading? I thought you would've crawled under a rock after all the drama last year. Sigh
why do u still have a career. this is pathetic
Try using a sheet pan..also  it will taste a lot better if you temper it too
Stunning
yall really be complaining about Jay hair but the Jay that was tagged is literally a different jay tho...

Joffey Skidmark's looks same old lady. 👹🧠💩
please review the elf x chipotle launch!!
Why is Everyone attacking Jeffree? Ya he looks tired, ya he doesn't have his nails done. Did people forget were in a middle of a pandemic, tf he need his nails for when he's at home? Maybe he is losing money, but people are losing lives here. Its not about how "Hype" he has to be, his launches did fine but somehow people are forgetting that most people are too broke to buy his palette and dont be lying saying you aint. People have lost their jobs and people who do make those palettes to be launched are working frontlines in that factory. He put out what he could because he's already losing money as is, aint no point to be putting out new palettes during this time.
Why cant tina burner get this flawless wig?
His acc is like kinda dead most people just hate in the comments but likee he said the n- word and he got with Kanye 😭😭😭 bye lmao.
YouTube didn't fucking tell me about this video.... WTF I HAVE MY NOTIFICATIONS ON 🤬😡😭
I need the ORGY palette!!!!  it is out of stock 😭😭
Just came back to check if he was still relevant
Thanks for deleting my comment
He must relate to cavities on a deep, personal level.
flop era
I love you Jeffree and you are so amazing as a person. You deserve all your happiness. P.S. You're such a beautiful human inside and out!
You need to do a collab with PLAYBOY MAGAZINE like kylie did with The Grinch
Wait you not canceled?
You should just make one big palette for all your eye colors.
Anyone else who would love a mini to every palette for travel & MUA purposes? Mini blood lust, mini Blue blood, mini thirsty, mini cremated, (mini orgy restock), mini blood money, etc
I think his make up looks terrible. His base and blush is cringe
Jeffree, please do a review on the chipotle x elf collaboration!!!
My dumbass still can’t afford the makeup and I lowkey have been CRAVING to try JefreeStar.Cosmetics❤️✨🤤💉🩸
Okay but DAMN wisdom looks awesome!
Jeffrey you car cancelled don’t try to come back
He is just throwing new pallets at us it's not gunna make us happy sorry🖐️
https://youtu.be/yhtZp_AXSNY
Isn’t a similar palette already launched? Where’s the creativity
I wasn’t prepared to deal with seeing his real nails😬 Suppose it’s what happens when you’re clawing away to stay relevant.
Bad person
I resold my bloodsugar palette two weeks ago. I never used that thing because 1. it is too extra and unusable for daily make up routines, even the neutrals leant to far into the whole red and orange thing for me and 2. many of the matte shades were SUPER dry for me, ESPECIALLY that shade Prick he put in the mini, feels like literal chalk on the skin. So, bye!
the fact that the mirror literally looks like a polish flag- 💀
Your business is slowly dying ... karma 😃
You are so toxic
You are so toxic
You are so toxic
You are so toxic
You are so toxic
You are so toxic
You are so toxic
You are so toxic
I love the pallet and u are so pretty!!
you look kind of red in this
Imagine living in the past and cry about it when in the present some youtubers/streamers do messed up stuff and challanges and nobody say something lol. Like the streamer who killed is gf on the livestream because ppl donate to
Hi
Jeffree, I'm very sorry you have to live with an angry mob behind you at everything you do, just for the purpose to stab you everyday. It's a toxic witch hunt by 'Social Warriors', who believe the best way to resolve a problem is to eliminate someone. I  feel you are in some way infected by this. Constructive criticism is good, bashing someone just for breathing is horrible. I hope you'll be in a better place soon
God bless you so u can stop being gay jesus loves u
I feel like this is a last chance type of palette. It may seems like there’s no difference but I feel this as not only a last attempt for money and his old life but happiness and company
“Guys a lot of you said Jeffrey put yourself more on the pallets” which one of you said that ?
😂😂😂Oml it’s been years since I haven’t see you! Hii!
Jeffrees nail artist stopped working with him
I hate seeing jeffrees face on packaging
Do you know who Cher is? (The signer).   He looks just like herrr
My name is Ruby ❤️
You should write an autobiography for real for real, the shane dawson x jeffree star documentary was really inspiring but i want to know what you do and how you went from 0 to 100, because i think its not only because of jeffree star cosmetics
He's trying so hard to show he's not bothered. He's bothered 🙄
wow you are running out of ideas lmao
Sooo they literally took blood sugar original palette and just put it on a white thing. He put it at the same price as the original, like what??? This man really wants money and more money.  Edit: Maybe my comment will get deleted :b
I feel like he’s lost his love for his makeup brand. All the recent launches have been so uninspired. He looks miserable
Hi Jeffree, can you do a Hisoka look? If you did I'd be happy to :D
i forgot he existed lol
The mini packaging looks cheap 🥺 doesn’t seem like packaging you’d normal go for...
What’s that piece of food in ur teeth
The wig isnt it..
Ewwwwww.
3 years an so much talent among you beautiful characters i love it . I love you all and i love what you represent even when u all are trying not to be canceled, I UNDERSTAND NOW thank you for being so honest when you don't have to be or do shit.
Where his brows
So is @jeffreestar still out here helping out us struggling folks? because I could use a random cash app blessing right about now $kelleysharpe
Real lips?? What?
♥️💓💕💓♥️💕💓💕♥️
Dusty, crusty, and musty
Why so much hate comments? I don't wear makeup and know much about makeup but I enjoy watching his vids. Your negativity means nothing lmao. He will still make bank. Haters are pathetic
Y’all hate him so much but y’all watch him and that’s making him money dumb ass lol
I love the palette and I don’t even care for red like that
Jeffre girl you look beautiful 🤩
I have watched you for a year now. What happened to your views, went from 13 million to 1.4 ?? Love your work but ditch the drama
I'm going to start a union at Jeffree Star cosmetics
Not you deleting comments 😍
✨Happy March 8 Jeffree Star ⭐️🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹💫
I can use three shades lmfao
He is losing subscribers
Lame
I feel like he’s going broke lol his packaging looks like clairs makeup and his lip filler is gone , no nails, you can see wrinkles. He’s so robotic it seems like he’s just trying to sell something.
Quit youtube. No one likes you anymore.
I miss when JEFFREE reviewed other people’s products
How is kanye
Wassup with these fake hateful homophobic comments😭under his page
dude get your face off the packaging.......its weird
Idk why people hate you I personally been following you since the beginning! And I love your makeup, and your makeup videos ignore the hate, and keep on shinning girl love the beautiful packaging on the makeup blood sugar is really iconic.
We need house update tour🤪🤪!!
Deleting comments looool
JEFREE STAR WAS ONE OF THE FASHION GUESTS ON SEASON 7 OF AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL. MOVING CATWALK EPISODE.
Hey jeffree i just want to say thanm you for being an inspirational :) My life has come to a halt i dont know if u will ever read this but i had to sell my house and had a new baby with a 3 year old and living in a council state its awful here :( but seeing ure confidence helps me alot lots of love
Watching music on YouTube i hadn't heard in awhile good charlotte River came on and I was like hey thats jefree star Xd
What did you do to Shane Dawson?
Anyone else remembers Jeffrey star from deuces songs ?
Wow hardly anything if nothing sold out. It is so crazy that you have to be so fake 100% of the time in this cancel culture and people that subscribe to it.. your day is coming. We are close to the end of freedom for basically anything. Good job haters with the thin skin. Hate works in reverse. IDK if MLK had this dream 😞
Can you do a review of profusion cosmetics? I recently found them at walmart.
Please make wifey permanent
Dude stop deleting comments.
vhs
I’ve been scrolling the comments and most of them are negative lol
I’m just wondering how this guy still gets millions of views and why people are still buying his cash grab products-
I LOVE YOU JEFFREE !!! YOU ARE THE BEST, AND YOU ARE SO FUNNY ALWAYS!  love frem Denmark.... <3
Not you deleting the comments <333
He really went 👋🏻👋🏼👋🏽👋🏼
Yawn.
i feel like commenting hate on here serves no purpose. You hate or dislike jeffree ok? so why are you here watching his videos, giving him views, giving him adsense, even taking the time to comment on his video so he gets even more algorithm, like are yall okay?
Cavity highlight to die for. Xxx
Never answer my question😟
I like this collection, I love a red shadow to wear out it is a hard color to find
Answer me please
Jeffree I’m so pissed at you for not answering my questions.Were can I find your makeup 💄 In Fargo North Dakota?
I am living for his hair!
This launch is a whole period. Nobody ask for it.
Omg the manipulation master is back wow how did we forgive him🤬🤬🤬🤬

Not him ignoring all the allegations,,
Why didnt he swatch the brown shade?

I’m dentist and i love makeup♥️♥️♥️😍😍😍
I love the red coler
how is this guy still on youtube
Repent Jefree !
Looks like a old hag ! Joffey Skidmark
Old ! Nasty Joffey Skidmark !
Regardless of what anyone says Jeffree is hard working,talented and has some of the best makeup on the market
Most Jeff Star makeup looks tacky and is overpriced.  Change my mind.
We need yellow palette  :)
you said astronomical and it made me think you should come out with a space/astronaut palette
How come Jenna marbles has gone and you aren't. I hate the YouTube community.
For that dentist chair photo shoot they put the air/water syringe on a high speed hand piece. hilarious.
https://youtu.be/LX8IuEnRT74
Just ordered a whole bunch of product to use for my makeup for my wedding, so excited I love all of Jeffree’s collections ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m living for this palette
I'm going to say this simply and I don't give a shit if you hate me or not. Stop commenting drama and hate on Jeffree. If you don't like him, don't click on the f-ing video. Thank you very much. Now fricken leave. You're not welcome here.
I bought this and am honestly disappointed, everything is very dirty and one of the highlighters are broken, the white palette had eyeshadow on the sides, the mini palette looks less put together and more rushed then other mini’s.
ello, i heard about this make up artist so I came to say...  E
Maybe I’ll buy something again when he makes and I’m sorry palette including 50 shades of apologies to everyone you’ve attacked
What a ugly person inside and out. A real shame
Where is Maddie though?
Why is his makeup cracking so bad.Im only watching this vid in 480 wtf
What do you think of the new chipotle make up that’s coming out
I'm only seeing blood where the sugar
why wasn’t ouch swatched lol
I love that photo on the mini and on everything. I'm I love. I can't way til my mini arrives 😍❤️ yaaas

Jeffree can you try out the velvet beauty sponge!?
He's a proud supporter of China. Never buy
The cavity pallette is so pretty ❤️❤️.
i need all of them!!❤❤❤❤but  jeffree is stunning in here!👄🔥🔥❤
You didn't swatch the top right shade in the mini. Just fyi.
this looks exactly like blood sugar tho
Jesus loves you 😀✨☺️
flop
The collection kinda flopped in a way tbh
VCR lolol you mean VHS 📼
All the lip shades were swatched on a light skin tone.. can we get some shades on different skin tones
Is that a boy or a girl
Let me just say this THAT WIG PERIOD!!!!!!
Idk 3 yr anniversary just sounds ridiculous to me. Wow 3 whole yrs!!!! 5yrs maybe but 3 yrs is almost like a desperate money grab. Like he said it was one of his best selling palette's. Makes you wonder if he just really wanted or needed a for sure seller.
You tats look like shit, did you get them for free by people learning for the first time ROFLMAO
Is it just me or why does his channel feel so dry now unlike before...
Y’all really still watch him.. ew.. I never liked him, I clicked on the video bc it was in my recommendations.. y’all are just as gross as he is for still supporting him.
Your rubbish
Bruh yall commenting wont do nothing hes been canceled and hes still famous and rich so plz stop
Would there be ever a yellow palette
I love my Safeway tweezers
Eye brows are for guys  Safeway tweezers
What if we pluck out all our brows okays ... cuz eye brows are for guys  All lgbt 🏳️‍🌈 people should pluck out there eye brows for beauty  I plucked all my eye brows out in 29
We love. A black queen 👸🏿
Damn. I used to love his videos. Like there's so much energy in those compare to this one. They don't make me smile and excited anymore. I remember when he used to upload and I'll be on my laptop in less than 2 minutes later, but now this upload feels more like "meh"..
Ice 19:05 Pop. Love.
why do you have the time to delete all the comments
ur packaging keeps getting tackier babe, give up now, your like a million years old :)
Perfect timing for a mini! 😍❤️  I'm planning on backpacking towards the end of the year (maybe😂) and u gotta pack light for that shit! ....now where to squeeze the vault🤔
Just subscribed love ur videos huh 💓💓💓💓
Yassssssssssssssssssssssss jeffree
Watch mwatcanyons makeup video dirty noob.
Dentist : you have a cavity in your mouth  Me : I got a free cavity pallete  DR: WTF  JEFFREE STAR : HI HOW ARE YA  😅😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow he is loosing subs
If Clifford was a recovering heroin addict.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGyMJQDlsTw
Stopped smoking weed when i found out jeffree smokes... u suck
Jeffree I made a few purchases from the blood sugar  collection one of the items was the hoodie I opened her up and I was shook it is beautiful and I love the logo the look the texture so worth it.  I can’t wait for the skin care line
Ummm 🤔 Is your dad proud of this because being rich is not everything
Wow RED 😍 My favorite colour
He coming out with launches way more then he used to... lmao
My guy looks like a period
Jeffree I think it’s time to make a collection for the 50+ as it is a huge market ,  Us oldies love makeup and trying to look the best we can with skin care and makeup, we know we can’t look 30 again but can still look great with the right products and knowledge and a lot of us have the money to spend but there is no products ???  Jump on it before someone else does and make that initial killing ... and yes I would love to do it with you 🥰 ( I have loads of ideas )
I love the hair and you look amazing!
The lipsticks look identical to stuff he already realeased. Candy joint looks like doll parts
Haha some of us have natural inch long nails and we paint them ourselves, by girl!
Curt Cobain hated mainstream stuff, wonder how he would feel about this corporate wannabe having him tatted on his chest. He detested the bmw driving yuppies who bought tickets for Everett  tour after the 89 tour. . . He’d be devastated about that tat
Something looks different 🤨
I’m not sure if this is allowed but it’s worth a shot right? My fiancé got a car from a family member of mine. They were the only owner and took good care of this car. My fiancé got this car about 3 weeks ago.  Well yesterday my fiancé drove home from work as his car began to smoke. He parked it in front of our apartments and took a shower. The car went into flames as he was in there. The car’s transmission and whole front of the car is completely melted. We are devastated and trying to get him another car for work as he is the sole provider as I go to school to become an ultrasound tech. I have been looking for work but due to Covid my place of employment had closed down. We are asking if anyone could find it in their hearts to help us we would appreciate it. Thank you all so much. gf.me/u/zk3h2c
are you gay?
You are pro at make up and a perfectionist but i gotta tell you the truth, your make up is not on fleek in this video.... your skin seems greasy,  the face lines are obvious, probably that foundation is not doing its job , the highlighter made it all worse , it is like mis-placed and make you look sweaty and greasy..... the whole look feels as if it is done by an amateur
I’m not even finished with this video and this is already the prettiest makeup collection I’ve ever seen omg
Ur so talented I love u so much bro
Hi!!!! I have a request could you review Sheins makeup line it’s called She glam
Be friends wit Larry
Omg cavity looks so good
And, finally I found proof for the reason why the human species is ending.  Here it is - watch and grieve humans - the rest of the universe will not miss you,.
My daughter just said "why does that man have blood on him? He's scary" lol
He should review the animal crossing colourpop makeup collection or Halsey new makeup line
everyone is literally taking time out of their day to come to this video, give it a view, throw in a hate comment and feed that algorithm 😂 y’all are stupid asf and subscribed on top of it plz😭
Your look screams *Madam Red*
The past several videos I've watched I have noticed that Jeffree seems to be forcing his usual natural perkiness and excitement. He just doesn't seem happy and that's a bummer. Maybe it's time for him to go back to his roots and do makeup tutorials and reviews. I miss those vids.
Who actually watches this shit and thinks this is great entertainment Jesus.
Sis you getting real old by the face, not that aging is wrong, it's just that you can age gracefully if youre a good person which you obviously arent.  in the end no amount of botox can really conceal whats rotting inside. theres still time, jeff, stop with this whole influencer and internet thingy and go reflect.
John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son JESUS CHRIST FOR OUR SINS. so whoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life Amen Amen Amen Amen Amen Amen
I can't believe people like exists this is against everything against God commandments where the fuck this world is i am so fucking disguised by this
If looks could kill Rich Lux would be the fountain of youth.
Can nobody mention Rich Lux? His personality is faker than his Louis. Get the stitching right. Ya got the font all wrong too. Aaaaand.....your left eyelash is always lifting and your right constantly has glue on it. One word....blend.
I’m very picky when it comes to lipsticks but I would wear every colour in that vault
These comments don't pass the vibe check, I'm excited and I can't wait to see new stuff from your collection!
jeffree please unblock me on twitter...
When will you come out with your own skin care line??!! 10/10 would buy, would anyone else buy??
Jeffree has AGED
His brand must be going downhill because there is never hype now when he realises.
Beautiful as ever!!!!! Luya, Jeffree!!!!
You made me gay to thats fine just pls make a pink
Why does he look like a 60 year old?
Awww did you make this with the blood of your victims!
Who tf bought these
You are   everything
Love you
Sub count went *dowwwwn*  (Also I don’t want your overpriced Claire’s makeup. I’ll get my makeup from actual good people.)

Why haven't you done a pink palette? 🤔
imagine subtly flexing on people who you know have less than average lives and selling overpriced makeup only for it to suck ass. Cant imagine purposely starting a major controversy about a person who did nothing only to make a shitty apology subtly flexing your mansion and Hella overpriced shit, wowwwwwwww cant imagine
I love the new wisdom shadow it is amazing!
#Егор_Андрюшин жду обзор на эту коллекцию
the packaging looks SO cheap and tacky
Don't for get about that new house tour and. Please show your you're closet  tour I can,t wait to see it and Paris French # 1 million€euro💶🏵👠💅👒🏵
Jeffree, we love the make up because let's face it...its great. A lot people dont really like you for the shade of who you were, are and potentially will be... but hun...you talked so much SHIT and TEA about Nikita dragun putting her face on her make up and look...I hated her packaging and product as well but like........... cremated, orgy, and now this mini blood sugar. I get it, your face is iconic amd has been for many years back in the Myspace days. But like, we love the regal shit. The blood money palette was fancy looking with the almost gator like suitcase. The blood lust palette design, and overall quality the pallete was made with??? Fuck me up I want more palettes that regal. Please, make more of the tissue paper with your face and more cards but not the palettes sis. It ain't it
All his videos are is promoting his products now. He's changed. 😔 💵💰

I used to like watching your videos until you said the n word. YOUR SO CANCELED
OMG this hair....stunning, amazing, awesome.....  💗 💗 💗
It makes you look so unauthentic and fake when you go and delete every negative comment. And can you just be real and say “I don’t think Jay did anything wrong and that is why I’m still working with him.”
Whoa is that Madam Red, Ciel's aunt from Black Butler!?
finally a blood-sugar mini!!!
I love love loveeee this new relaunch!!❤️🤍❤️💜
Does anyone even buy his makeup anymore and why would I want to buy a pallet with the same colors twice. I won’t buy from has-been anyway, so 5 years ago
Wow he is really looking haggard

love you forever girl!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Gurl y u looking like Sia, I guess the toxics have that hair
No hate here or judging you I am just trying to help you. I don't want you or anyone to go to hell that's all. I have read my Holy Bible front to finish and it says being gay , lesbian, BI, Pan and Transgender is not being a Christian . God didn't make us to marry the same sex. The devil made it , and he wants to take many people down as he can. We can't change what God says he wants us not do and do . If any of us change or add to the Holy Bible he or   she will burn in hell forever .   If you are not a Christian or a believer listen up. God is real , Jesus is real, Heaven ,  Hell is real and Angels are real. The Holy Bible is not a fairy tale book filled with fake stories everything in it happened . If you are not saved or a believer please be come a christian before it's too late Jesus is coming soon  I don't want anyone to go to Hell . If you go to Hell you will never feel happy you will always be in pain and sadness instead. You will never see your friends , family or pets again. If you have hatred for the Lord let it go look deep inside your self you have good inside of you everyone does you just have to dig a little deeper inside your heart. Jesus was born of the virgin Mary, he did great miracles for many people, he died on the cross to save us from sin , he rose again on the third day and now sits with our God on the right side. To become a christian you got to leave all your sin behind you , hate all the evil wickedness of satan, read the holy bible, go to church, get baptized and be a changed new you. If you have friends or family who are not a Christian or not saved please pass it on this could help them stay out of hell . God bless you may the Lord be with you and shine upon you with his righteousness . I will be praying for everyone in this world to get saved and get to go to Heaven. Let no one go to Hell let's start a rivial for everyone .
Damm he's  a human he needs to have imperfections. What makes you different than him when you all are bullies?  And still here watching him. Anyways I love his makeup
`Wow.... I am absolutely shocked. I have been a loyal subscriber since you finished your music career and I have never... EVER... seen you lie so blatantly on camera. I expected a completely opaque and pigmented white eyeshadow. That is the least you can do for your struggling fan base. If you continue to release subpar makeup like this, you can kiss your oh-so sought-after rich huffy puffy lifestyle a sweet, relishing goodbye. You had better IMMEDIATELY release both an apology video and re-do this palette for even entertaining the joke that is this current palette.   - your ex-fan.
also all the packaging is lazy and boring.
Guy is like an annoying product pusher on QVC late at night 😬
i cannot believe someone so vile and heinous is still getting support.
is it just me or is jeffree lowkey looking old o__o
Can we get more single shadows please???? 😫😫🙏 Especially that one from the mini pallete 😍🥺❤
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
After spending 5 1/2 months in the slammer, I’m back and got a lot of catching up to do!!
Jeffrey should review Trixie Cosmetics
B*** like what the f*** your the best don't listen to haters
the packaging is beautiful, yall just jealous
i feel like the packaging is beautiful- yall really nitpicking
Hi Jeffree, please make a video explaining all the drama, what youve taken from it and how you want to move forward. You used to address all the drama and crush the liars and clout chasers I not only miss that about you but I also don't want to see you dissapear or suffer from all these people wishing hate on you. Hate drama and violence solve nothing I can tell your done with the drama and ignoring the cancle culture I love that about you but at the same time I want that to inspire you to be a better person dont let fame, money, haters, and clout chasers turn you into a monster and remember where you came from. Remember you have the power to turn yourself around not just your life. Redemption is real and you can still be truly happy no matter what comes at you. Remember to step outside your comfort zone and occasionaly let people in your life that make you uncomfortable or speak their mind even when it hurts. Yes-men will only make you a spoiled monster and thats why our parents tell us no. Only wishing you love and happiness jeffree this is coming from my heart because I really do care. I want nothing from you exept videos, makeup, and you to be truly happy with a life full of kindness remember the saying if you can't say anything nice say nothing at all and don't give into the temptation to gossip because these things will always come back to bite you.
Ms. Jeffree Star better start recognizing the people that keep Miss Thing living the life style she does. She might have works hard to get where she is but she doesn’t stay living high and mighty on her own. The little people matter too. I always defended her when people talked down about her but I didn’t care. I thought she had a fucking heart. Guess she is just like all the other rich fuckers living off of us suckers that buy their shit. Well Miss thing just lost another one. Not that she cares but I DO!  Pass that along to her.  🖕🖕🖕💔💔💔
Lost total respect for Jstar when he released a fucking CREMATED palette during a pandemic where 500k+ people died. He capitalized on the deaths in US.   THANK GOD I NEVER BOUGHT SHIT FROM HIS MAKEUP LINE
No entiendo niuna wea pero me gusts

Humans are just horrible, I’m sorry but we’ve all sinned, we have all messed up, the only difference is these influencers are seen by many, I’m sure A LOT of you including myself would be ashamed if our dirty secrets and bad behavior was out there for everyone to see, I’m sure a lot of you would probably off yourselves from it getting to out of hand. I think it’s pretty pathetic that cancel culture means someone must stop a career and kill themselves for maybe some people to forgive them. The fact that a death is what most people want is sick and just makes my statement of “humans being horrible” all that true. Humans can’t be pleased, so why do so?? I like that some influencers still do them even if the past was brought up and they apologized, humans aren’t ever satisfied, always that need for more and more and more. I think if someone doesn’t like someone then don’t watch them, simple but just like a human who is complicated, it’s such a complicated thing to do. I think humans shouldn’t start worrying about others opinions and feelings, they aren’t showing good intentions anymore, so let’s just put our middle fingers up to everyone and say f*ck you I’m gonna do me. We all die in the end why should I care about how you feel or do?? I don’t think not one person in this world would actually satisfy me or benefit me by being in my life. I only speak like this because I don’t live in my little bubble of “everything is good and never bad” those people never go anywhere, they complain about everything and get super offended easily. 🤮 anyways that’s my rant haha anyways have a horrible day everyone 😉☺️
Jeffree when are you going to make a Blood Sugar Crocodile Backpack 🎒??? I absolutely love your Blood Sugar collection!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take this into consideration. I need a beautiful Blood Sugar Crocodile backpack on my back Honey!!! Love you always 💋 💋💋
Omg I almost so happy I did get my order in and guess what just arrived!! Yes fast shipping 2 days to Canada !! Can’t wait
Who even cares about miss Jeffree anymore .... Bye
Is it just me or did everyone in the bye sisters action doesn’t post accept Jeffree
Who is buying this garbage 🤣
😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
Not all the hate comment being the most liked!? He doesn't deserve all this hate.... If he deserve it please explain to me
Do yall remember when he used to get millions of views in hoursss
I wish it had been all new shades. I dont want to buy a palette for 1 shade.
Just no
Comment section is so 🤨
This looks tacky af
Jeffree, please ignore al those hateful Yolanda's. Your make up is bomb and I can't wait until I get the vault tomorrow!
Are ppl still watching this pitbull?
the idea that it's tacky makes sense, but from looking at it, some ppl want memorable things with jeffree's face (to maybe add to a collection) i'm sure it's not going to be an every time thing but i think it was done well
Come on Jeffrey it’s the Internet people are becoming smarter than you think a lot smarter than you
Everybody knows the truth about you
You are the reason why the whole James Charles and TATI thing happened
Everybody’s going to find out the truth about you
You are a groomer
You need to be canceled

Hmmm.. just here for the comments, ain't even watching the vid😂🐽
*says he knows his shade names* Yet obviously has to look at the shade names..
I miss Nathan & you together. I wish you both be together again.
VCR unit carton?  You mean VHS?   I mean if they call it “VCR” then hey whatever have fun, but that carton is the shape of an actual VHS tape and not the VCR.
Oh man the dark Tented red Misery Lip Very Beautiful
Caution: dear jeffree⭐,, the portland poe-poe hauled me into the coo-coo ward on Thursday afternoon.ekgz,,psycho drugz,,,24 hours and 50 abrasions later I wuz released AND my makeup wuz still perfect.i love yew.sincerely yer  endlesss fan
He is literally releasing makeup products left and right
It looks like shit
Can someone PLEASE for the love of God tell me where to get all of the minis to the blood collection pallets?  I have asked on every site I can think of (yes even his) and have got NOTHING!!!  I am begging for an answer. Or do I have to wait for the anniversary of each pallet?  SHIT!!!!!!
He should review the chinese florasis make up brand
Jaclyn Hill Part 2.
whats w the outfit in the thumbnail?? looks like he hand made it... take a break jeffree.
WE STAN
if I had the money I'd buy everything that Jeffree makes it's crazy how good his stuff is.....*sigh* if only I had money.
WHY ARE PEOPLE STILL SUPPORTING HIMMMM?!
Candy joint is my favorite!
I still can’t get this out of my head when trying to rationalize this fanbase: https://youtu.be/RHH0zDRTwEg By H3H3
Yasser queen im dropping 500 on palettes when I get my taxes so excited
🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷
Can someone confirm if there is black pallette or goth style one I don't wear make up but I would start with that
First time I've ever seen him without fake nails... 💅
Lovely my little island here never believe in hard make up. But you inspired me I will always be strong in my make up and always grow stronger
I am an old Granny and I just LOVE you!
I’m glad the comments align with my views, I used to love/die for Jeffree but he has changed ... there is something different about him that I can’t put my finger in. Maybe it’s his desire for “money” and wanting more and more #greed - love love his make up but he isn’t selling it for me anymore. We need a fresh start!  PR needs to be fired.
Beauty ...  and 16:23 I like Misery ...
I’m gonna say it how it is : your a horrible person and your not addressing what you have done because your to selfish to ever admit what you have done
Love the last two lip shades!!
Where u in the video for falling in reverse for I'm not a vampire?? Cuh I just someone tall with pink hair kinda in the shape of how your hair was in love to my cobain n I just want to know so ya...
Holy shittttt that liquid lip vault. I’m deceased😍
I love your products other than the eyeliners! I’m always here, a loyal customer!
i didnt know 21 min ads for makeup existed until today
Sumn so sexy about that pop up you get when you dislike a toxic persons video...yk the one that says "*you dislike this video*"
Your channel is dying dude
Hope you’ve put your Gucci bags for sale cuz yo career slowly endin
Fuck me, this guy pumps out some product ..

Que hago acá viendo a un señor ehhh no se, hablando? Ni se ingles.
Are you boy or girl
😂🙏🏼 so many ppl asking about a pink palette when you just gotta use white 😂
You look like a clown. Happy Halloween. <howembarrissing>
Trump must be a Jeffree Star fan because the new golden statue has Trump Holden Jeffrey's iconic star wand check it out.
One of the only ones I don't have yet.... 😍😍🥰🥰❤❤💖💖

… hi everyone.   This guy is the perfect example of what is a psychopath. I know that the term is thrown around loosely, but this bozo is just perfect. He checks all the boxes. It’s amazing.   Did you notice how everything that involves him at this point in time, it’s just stoically ignored by him to this day? The way, not only it seems but it’s true, that nothing bothers him? No matter how big is the scandal, no matter deep is the hole, nothing seems to get to him. And, truth be told, it doesn’t. And it doesn’t because he’s unable to feel. To feel anything. For him, that concept is just something he can’t picture. To him, it doesn’t make any sense. He is unable to feel remorse or empathy, can’t even relate to the pain of others.    To him, there’s only one thing that matters. Himself. And he’s not even bothered about whatever others think about him or his actions. He just doesn’t give a rats’ ass. By the way, all of that, it's just funny to him.   All of you that keep following this guy are just enabling this behavior. Enabling, facilitating, and legitimizing his conduct.    Star is the perfect example of what’s a “toxic person”.   Unfortunately, he’s in a place, financially and status-wise, that the only thing that can bring him back is his own will to do it. He is not going to do it for his fans, not for his family or anything in the World. He doesn’t need so. There’s so long that his behavior has been supported by his fans, validated by them, that he sees no reason to change. That’s why the only thing that can bring him back is his own will. Nothing else.   Your support created this monster. Now, you just have no choice but to keep him. To keep him with all his ugliness.    I’ll bet you that the all-Shane Dawson situation is nothing but enjoyment to Jeffree Star. Just enjoyment. And he is loving it. While Shane is unable to even look at his mirror. It's funny, isn’t it?
Waaaa
When someone said the reason a person still has a fanbase as an awful person is because their fans think the same way.  All I can think reading these comments. Get you some education.
like canu make a vid swatching ur lippies according to the colour family like all nudes together,all pinkies, all reds,all browns,all funn colourssssss
Please ship to malaysia too! I really want that mini and lipsticks <3
Guys Cancel Culture is OVER! Sit down, lick your feelings
Nobody is wondering where your nails are
omg views a dropping drastically, people don’t even want to speak about him anymore
Really people?, y'all gonna trust another Jeffrey... Its not like the last one killed himself.
My favorite is the one on the left like second or third from the top I forgot the name but it looks almost identical to the color above it but with a little hint of gold? sadly I can’t remember the name of the shade but imma huge fan of coma that was a diff pallet tho
I think you are bathing in  Wisdom right now.
Stop making videos ❤️
I wish a purple palette was made
You're hair and makeup is so beautiful ❤️😍
Can you release a bronzed goddess palette with sunset inspired colors with coppers & golds for this beach babe?🤩🏝  Love you, your vibes, & your creativity💛🌻✨
Jefree should make a palette where you can choose different shades from any palette and include some makeup brushes to
Poor OLD Jeffree..
I’m going to sit here on my  50,000 dollar Versace couch and pose like an Afghan hound
I'm SOOOO happy I got EVERYTHIIIIING from this launch! I absolutely LOVE launches like this when I can afford everything and my Collection will be as Full as it possibly can be!! Now I just have to wait for it to get to me! Lol. Xoxoxo
So fucking cringe hahahaha.
You need to repeant as well I'm only saying this because I love u when I see the things people are doing in this world it brings me to tears 😔😞
I'm thinking of buying the highlighter palette, and using the red as a blushlighter...2 in 1 type of thing. I love red blushes, and to have a highlight built in would be awesome!
I really love the shade 'thinly veiled narcissism'! looks great on you 😘💋
I just want it all Dx :(
Can we see Shane Dawson bitc- * COUGH * I mean please?
I been saving to buy your beautiful make up you should do a rainbow pallet or purple
Omg your so beautiful
No one asked for your face to be on the palettes... I assume it has more to do with production budget.
You’re a horrible person inside and out you bring out so much negativity I can’t wait until more realize this soon 🖤
Could you please review florasis beauty?
I purchased the collection bundle!!! I can’t wait!!!!!! Thanks Jeffree!!!!!!!💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
Queen of highlighters
dafuq happened to its face?? Its right cheek looks like it has a badly inserted lump
I love me some you ❤️🩸💷💰
Why is everyone complaining I swear first people were like “put urself on the one of the palettes!” And now that he does y’all are hating smh
Jeffrey Star stays UNBOTHERED 👑
is it just me....or is his upper lip much smaller?????
Your so cancelled
Wow, what a bunch of evil trolls.who cares if Jeffrey is working back with Jay, its thier business.
Too bad my ass is too poor.
No one: why is he still here
Love this 😍
the packaging with his face on it is cringe. also, he seems a little erratic in this video.
Hmmmmm  everyyyything  assiiideee .. plz just react to James Charles's New drama 🤭🤭🤭😅😅😅 Omg jeffree I am such a big fan hope to see your cosmetics in India soon ... Hope to see u in India 🇮🇳💓💛❤💗💖🇮🇳💓💛❤💗💖🇮🇳💓💛❤💗💖🇮🇳
Ew this is the worst makeup drop he ever had.. #sorrynotsorry I expected more. No wonder he’s dropping subscribers fast.
I love ya  😍😍😍 my idol😍😍😍😍
we are celebrating your tone deaf approach to literal bullying & abuse from members of YOUR staff that you continue to work with after publicly saying you fired him?? 🤡
James charles has been grooming children . Are you not going to say anything about this Jeffrey or just keep allowing James charles to abuse children ??  Ignorance is bliss I guess
umm 64k likes wtf :(
When is Jeffree going to be making another mystery boxes
Different colour package same palette? I don’t see the point
Jeffree no one wants a pallet with your face on it
i dislike you a whole lot
A sweets palette in sparkle pink !!!!! Since you love your sweets !!!! All pink eyeshadow !!!  YESSSSS BITCH!!!!!!!!
Bring hair by jay on next since y’all are besties 👯‍♀️
this channel is a joke.
Hey Jeffree, I don't wear makeup but I sure do enjoy your videos.  Awesome look today.  Shocking Red.
Can you help me by sending money @jeyfreestar
Can’t belive why can exist shit like this thing
I hope this man’s finances go down to the point where he lives in a one room place with no cars
Palette no. Btw you lost😘
You’re honestly depressing. The palette, disgusting. You’re going downhill real fast boo
I am so sad. I've been on a no buy since March 2020, except two gifts. Bx the state lowered by monthly disability from 388 to 260 a month (I have kidney disease and lupus plus some major depression and anxiety), my no buy will continue for another year. If anyone wants to bless me with the mini or even a lippie $mindydimiceli is my cash app. Love you jeffree. So often, you video have kept me from self harming. ,🍭🍬🍭
His views are slowly going down. Only 1.2M when he usually gets 10M and up. Karmas a bitch Jeffree
Love it. Good job jeffrey.. You're really passionate about your products and at your work and selling beauty. Your personal issues aside, your devotion and drive to your craft will always keep you on top :)
Frozen Prick is definately his new nickname
Why would we buy a palette with 8 of the same shades...? Great colour but not a 28 dollar shade 😒
A mini for the cremated palette please
We need more goth makeup and makeup looks jeffree starr my darling
Jeffree star are beautiful
Actually, your fingers look great without the nails. You look less fake.
Just admit it. Your business is slowly dying.
Dose it worry him to not sell out anymore? Like before everything was gone in seconds and now it’s been days and there’s still warehouses full?
Really wanted to buy it but can’t justify it for one shade I wish it had all new shades
HAHAHA! I was thinking, "What's with the basic nails?" Glad you addressed it!
3:47  me when I realized I wasn't pregnant xD thank you Jesus  😍
Two questions: Why does he have to many subs Why are there more likes than dislikes on his video
Nathan’s getting REAL pussy now,  and guess what?  She doesn’t have to pay him 😂
Will you ever release PURPLE ONLY palette? I know Blood Lust is out there, but that is not what I mean. I would like to see a big palette of many different shades of purple, including sheer ones. Please! :-) 💜🤍💜🤍💜🤍💜🤍 P.S. You can call it Purple Purgatory. ;-)
How does this guy still have so many supporters?? Y r people stupid
IM OBSESSEDDDDDD AHHH
I want the mini pallette❤ but other than me did anyone notice he didn't have his fabulous nails on ...
I know some people are saying they didn’t like the packaging. But I gotta say that was one of the main reasons that I wanted to get and got the highlighter and mini palette because it was gorgeous let alone the awesome product inside.
Does J Star have a nude palette? I know nude is supposedly overdone but I would LOVE one from him... nudes with a few complimentary colors thrown in. Basic but necessary!!!
REDDDDDD!!!!!! MY FAV COLOR YASSSS
This was such a lazy launch LMAO you used old pics from old photo shoots for your packaging. The mini palette only has 1 new shade? LOL ok. The highlighter palette looks horrible. The colors suck. Why would anyone want a red highlighter
Also, it seems like he’s cracking up. The maniacal laughter at his own terrible jokes. Yikes. 🤪
Why does he look like that old, drunk woman sitting in the corner of every bar?
When all of your whiny crying babies own your own cosmetics company, you can not put yourself on the cover. Until then, no one gives a shit what you think.
I would be totally psyched out if I got the chance to meet you in person and hangout someday Jeffree.
perfect
Y'all on here with this hate, here's the thing. If you don't like him, don't entertain him. BUT you CANNOT be mad that this human has dedicated their life to cosmetic. From understanding formulas, to ensuring the packaging is perfect, so shut up with your hate. You would never be able to create anything like  this line has, simply because you don't have the scientific education. I am so over this "cancel culture." It's possible to not agree with something and keep it moving. Lawd. Anddddd by the way, this brand will still bring in more income than we ever will. So shut it!  xoxo I still bought the collection!
why is he not cancelled yet?? wtf
Where are you? You blend into the background. I love it!!❤️😂❤️
The merch looks like I just committed a murder and forgot to change out of the evidence clothing lol
Tina burner is that you?
I love you Jeffree, when I got my blood sugar pallete I felt very special. It’s the only pallete I use & it’s the only Jeffree star product I own because I can rarely afford to buy makeup, let alone your makeup. I love your brand and I’m all here for it sis💘 I’ve hit pan on glucose, cherry soda and donor & I put sweetener on EVERYTHING 💖 keep doing what you do
ew......wtf why put ur face on it
We need a designer palette 😍😍
We need a glitter palette!
Did he skip the swatch on the top right one?
waiting for jeffree’s 420 pallet 🙄
I like Jeffree
omg the orange one caught my attention in half a second!! love it!!!
Girl we need a palette for every color of the rainbow 😂, we got red, green, blue, purple. We just need pink, yellow, and orange to complete. If he comes out with the whole damn rainbow of palettes I will never need to use another brand again 😂
Items Ordered: Item  Quantity  Jeffree Star Cosmetics Blood Sugar Anniversary Bundle	 Jeffree Star Cosmetics  Blood Sugar Anniversary Bundle  2  $500.00  Subtotal	$500.00 Shipping	$0.00 Sales Tax	$33.13 Order Total	$533.13 SO HAPPY!!!!! CANNOT WAIT FOR IT TO ARRIVE!
Will this be a permanent collection or limited time?
jeffrey should make a palette that has people favorite shades from each palette
I love u jeffree star am a huge would love to meet u
What this is a half assed juvie place knock off looking bullshit. I am legit giving away a bunch of your makeup to my son's like gf. See I think what's happening here is your head got to big and the talent went out the damn window
most of the swatches from the palette had a cut between when jeffree star startes applying the shade on his palm and when we actly see the swatch smh
Do you sell candy joint on its own?
You didn’t swatch the brown shade!
I feel like I'd like the lipstick vault a lot since I really only like red lipstick. 😊
Whenever Jeffree finally gets "Cancelled" (y'all been trying to cancel him for years) I feel like people are still going to buy his palettes. He has the best makeup ideas, color stories and shade range/diversity.       I'm tired of influencers and celebs half ass-ing shades and quality because they know their fans will buy anything. Jeffree is ALOT of things but he can make a well thought out creative high quality product and that's one of the only things I truly respect about him.
The only reason I’ll pay for this its because I’m a dentist  Oh no, forget about it, it’s not what I was expecting
Is this limited edition?
is this a man or a woman? A trans-man or a trans-woman?
I love firestarter
better  start  saving  ,
I just want a goth palette, but I do love the makeup.
Okay but hear me out... a cool toned highlighter palette and call it ✨Minty Fresh✨
Love ALL the lipstick shades
bro your face is so scary.... 😭😂
My boy lookin like a praying Mantis on the thumbnail
Im not used to seeing you without nails. Bring back the iconic nails you always have on 😁😁😁The ruby red eyeshadow should be the new lipstick shade.stunning
What's with all the fake enthusiasm??
He's beginning to look old. Time destroys beauty.
make a blueberry pal ......glittery blue specks
Where is jawbreaker collection
The mirror, literally Polish flag 🇵🇱 so cute 🥰
It's nice for a collector. I just can't justify buying a pallete I already own though. I will buy the highlighter and the vault. The highlighter is gorgeous. It will work for most soon tones.
I'm sure I'm the only one but I absolutely love yellow eyeshadow. It's very hard to find a good yellow though. They're often chalky/patchy/disappears. Jeffree PLEASE make a yellow themed palette. If anyone can pull it off.... It's you.
As a designer, I'm always excited to see new packaging concepts from Jeffree because they're always creative and custom and unique from other makeup. But this packaging for the mini looks a little.... Basic? It literally looks like these cheap palettes that I buy off amazon 😐 I'm kind of disappointed
All i saw was Jeffree without nails tbh
"Goooood morning to everyone except the guy that used to do my hair." Yea, right.  I guess, good morning to him too
We love a Flop anniversary lmao
Ew
Cant believe I used to subscribe to this monster of a person
What in the cheek filler is going on
Cherry soda ftw
It's like putting chili sauce on your face
They are soooooo gorgeous . Good bye Kylie for sure.
I hope you guys realize there’s so many make up that are better than this, SPECIALLY coming from this problematic and rac**t person .
Please help me my home confiscation problem I need 25 thousand dollars please help me
Cherry Soda is my favourite it's a beautiful red!
You're so boring. Please buy a new personality and friends
Hi Friend, Great Video .! full support. Have Great Day!
To be fair Sir Jeffree yr not fun anymore, thee only time u show yr mug here is to Sell yr Stuff .  Next......
When jeffree showed the cavity palette i had goosebumps
What a money grab, bringing back your most successful palette won't save you from your downfall, your brand will never sell as it used to
I need a blood theist but mental health edition
Imagine if we ever got a Jeffree Star × Louis Vuitton palette!
🔥🔥🔥
I’m sad no mystery boxes this Valentine’s :(
Can someone be kind enough to send money to my sisters cashapp?
Can someone be kind enough to send money to my sisters cashapp?
Can someone be kind enough to send money to my sisters cashapp?
Think pinnnnnk!!!!!!
Uninterested at this point ...
💕💕💕
While I still love all the makeup nothing will make me buy any of it anymore after the Jay thing. Jay is a VILE human. No one speaks like that and doesn't mean it.  My brain did not erase itself just because you're dazzling us with new makeup. Sorry not sorry doll.
This is what you have to do to be rich in money!!!! No thanks
I’m a self taught mua and I learned mostly from playing with makeup on my own and watching jeffree’s videos and I want to collab with him to make a makeup palette and I also really wanna make lashes. So this is day 1 of trying to get his attention so we can collab. It probably won’t happen but here’s to trying!
CONGRATULATIONS JEFF!!!! Alarm is set u all .. (fingers are crossed i get my order before my birthday on march 9 and before i take my trip to (9-18) bike week at Daytona Flordia) im always at work , and all my co workers know i gotta step off the floor for a min to place my order cause they all know im a die hard jeffree star makeup fannatic ...lol  Loving the look of the new site ...

Review Kara Beauty???
I loved the palette and its oled colors
Looking forward to the lip vault 16 new colours!
Jeffree makes me want makeup (and I’ve never felt the need to put any on) because he just makes it so beautiful and aesthetic and artistic!! Everything is always so iconic ❤️
I need like an ALL PINK PALETTE , an ALL ORANGE 🍊 PALETTE,  an ALL YELLOW PALETTE ....helll even an ALL BLACK Palette LMAO!!
Can you please do a gold/peach palette
Omg jeffree.... Just checked the website and the new blood sugar drop is almost sold out of everything, and it wasn't supposed to drop until tomorrow. Plz let us know when you restock
Who the fuck needs all those red lipgloss. That's ridiculous!
only 1.5m views in a week LOL
The foundation today is a little dry I say change it up but I’m obsessed with the new color😭😍 Gorgeous as always, love you jeffree
I loving this whole collection!! I want them all.
I love how this guy struggles to even get 2M views. #cancelled
Love jeffree star products but I preferred the palettes without faces/photos on it 😭😞 it just makes them look cheaper.. I just don’t like them. Shameful, I end up putting everything in a magnetic palette sadly. Still love 100% quality and price.
Your wig is stunning
HIS WIG IS SICKNING
We need a pink, a yellow, and an orange pallet!!!
Everyone here probably hates James Charles

girl when are you gonna delete your channel.
He should make custom minis for each full palette where you can put whatever 9 shades you want from the full one
LOVE LOVE LOVE..WANT WANT IT ALL !!!!!! 💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💕💕💕
Next up should be the JSC app
Jeffree, stop acting like everything’s ok. I feel like you’re just making more and more products in hope that it might bring you back from everything you’ve done. Someone had to say it. You are a disgusting person.
Who else googled VCR on their beeber?
Everyone is wearing masks yet there's another lip product released. *sigh*
omg wheres your acrylics!
Why would I want a pallet named after a dirty tooth.
The lighting makes the top of that wig glow and looks white
Why does jeffree has short nails and thin lips do i miss something..... he also look distinctly different but i cant put my finger on what is it
You have got to review the Opte. Love and light
I must say that I fricking love you- like I understand that people don’t like you but. Your so nice and can we just mention your makeup ugh stunning . I have legit loved you since I have been 7 or 8 and I’m not 11!! So tempted to get your makeup but I don’t have enough money!!!  Remember since is my opinion :) no hate
Am I the only one that thinks his makeup looks off in this video? The eyeshadow doesn’t look like it’s been blended properly kind of like a rush job 😖
Jeffree! Can you plz review the Super Sponge beauty sponge??
Who even buys jeffree’s makeup anymore lol
I regret buying your products and supporting you as much as I did 😔
Hmm   I am looking at your face and to me it seems as if your foundation is too dark?  I feel like in the past it was  lighter and you looked so much crisper.  Thank you for your video.
Love bite my tongue
For Christmas I got my first Jeffree Star cosmetics pallette. I really enjoyed doing makeup for fun so I always watched Jeffree I just could never afford a pallette. I ended up getting bored of doing my makeup all the time and also didn’t have the money to support my habit lol, but one I got the blood lust pallette I fell in love all over again and now I can’t stop sending Jeffree all my checks😭❤️❤️
Jeffrey, everything is absolutely gorgeous & stunning colors. I would love to get my hands on every single product.  God Bless on your Blood Sugar Anniversary Line!. We all know you'll do great. Hugs & kisses, Sandra 🌹🍒♥️♥️
@JeffreeStar  Please think about making kid sized t-shirts!!! My 5 year old keeps telling me she wants a Jeffree star T-shirt for her birthday this year. She thinks you are absolutely beautiful and she loves makeup and expressing herself. I have many pallets and other makeup products from you, and her favorite is the blood sugar pallet ❤️ Definitely loving that their is a mini so she can match me, as she is my mini 🥰❤️
He really be looking like the people that stop gum diseases in mouth wash adverts in the thumbnail
nice tato😂😂
oooo
Hahaahhaahahahahahahah 1000 years ago adults would be on horseback going to battle. 2021 just hell on earth. Get a grip
That Lip Vault is EVERYTHING.
i'm so sad i missed out on that highlighter palette omg :'c
Jeffreee!!! Luvv your hair color in this..nothing  like a hott red head 😍😋💕
EVERYTHING IS SOLD OUT WITHIN A FEW HOURS. 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Bro your fame is slowly dwindling
Hi this is my Chanel
Hi this is my Chanel
Hi this is my Chanel Yotube
What a barf name from a barf creature.
Why couldn't u pay for your own employees instead of taken a ppp loan out ur a millioner people really needed that money and are homeless and have lots everything.  How do you sleep at night !!!!! it's disgusting!!!
Kanye in the back:🎥🧑🏾
Review Halsey’s new makeup pleassse
lol ur views HAHAHAHAHA
Starting to look a lot lik jaclyn 👀
I love jeffrees packaging usually, but I really hate pictures of yourself on them, it cheapens it. Stick to luxury vibes!
Anyone else think the sweatsuit looks extremely similar to Colleen/Miranda’s? 👀
I just can't ignore the fact that you guys in the comments are just so hateful. I don't know what's wrong in your everyday lives, (I'm sorry upfront) but if you don't like someone or their content, what happened to -don't f_k!ng watch them-? I mean, you don't like a person but you make sure to let them know in every step they're taking? I'm really sorry for you.
I am really excited for this release tomorrow 26th Feb. I popped into the website to have a sneak peak and they are all showing as sold out already. I have never been lucky enough to get any of Jeffrees new items in the day of release, but am surprised and very disappointed to see sold even before the official release. 😭
I can’t believe despite all the toxic shit this man has done that he’s still relevant. Like everyone else had their careers ended and he’s still here like wtf
Nononono
i like hot :)))
His skin looks so bad what’s going on I mean he still looks good I have just never seen it look like that😐
You forgot you nails
Dammit, what lipstick color is jeffree wearing?? I was hoping he was going to mention it!!
His makeup is looking super cakey in this video
All these beauty gurus are toxic af
*Grab a redbull* goes to the fridge to grab one from the pack
Are any of the darker reds going to be larger liquid lips???
um.....
Cavity ! Seriously ! 🤣 next what ? Toothpaste ?
Omg thanks for the new sweat suit and the cavity
Ok, I don't feel like rewatching, so ?, did he say the white blood sugar was like limited edition? Or do you guys think it will be here for a minute?
I hope he makes a purple pallet cause I need a purple type pallet
Please stop while you’re ahead of putting your face on the packaging
They are all beautiful  colors  and i would love to see  more browns and reds.
I'm gonna cry when he comes out with a candy pallet with lots of pink, yellow, blue, orange neons like super bright colors oh my gawdddd I will buy that when it comes Lol
Jeffree would you please consider collaborating with smaller influencers, allowing them to have their own palette under the JS brand?
i am so surprised to see your products at Taobao from China !
Sugar Spike and Candy Joint! ❤️❤️❤️ 😍😍
I'm a new fan but definitely a ride or die! I legit have an alarm set for this launch!!
I was literally just wishing there was a way to only buy these red shades from Blood Sugar and now I find this video. After I just bought the Lil’ bit Psycho palette from BH Cosmetics. Guess I’m about to have a shit load of reds lol. ♥️
What’s wrong with his lips? Does he need to re do them?
the blood sugar palettes are beautiful as usual but... everything  else is the UGLIEST PACKAGE DESIGN ive ever seen from you🤮.... i think it started with cremated....  this brand isn't showing high end anymore... junior high maybe. And why are 6 of those 16 new colors the SAME?  Hard pass.
love you jeffree don't listen to the haters
Why is JEFFREE keep losing subs??
Subscribe my channel for makeup tutorials ♥️
Trash.
Why do u have Jesus on your chest, that is offensive
Who can go way back and remember Jeffree's Myspace merch tho?
Releasing the same pallette with one different color 😂 why
I dont care for the new teeth,  but I like the no nails....I see that a lot of people are starting to stop with the fake crazy nails phase,  and I'm here for it......that lipstick vault??   AHmazing!!
Red is cute I like watch you
Please get into the shade shifting duochrome shades.
BITCH your EPIC!
NOBODY SAID TO PUT YOURSELF ON THE PACKAGING ughghhhhh
I'm so proud of you Jeffree Star! You've come a long way!
What happened with his assistant Maddie??  I follow her on Instagram she now works for a fitness clothing line and her and Jeffree don’t follow each other anymore 🧐
Jeffree is starting to be one of "Those who we shall not mention by name" that only make youtube videos when he selling something. I miss the Jeffree makeup reviews.
his skin looks rough under that makeup. lol
When is the next time you're going to collab with Shane Dawson
Seriously luscious massacre straight up low key threatened Jeffrey and kept insinuating she would go missing and never be found..... wtf
i agree with a lot of the comments here, i really dont like seeing anyones face on a palette....seeing a specific human/influencer face, even jeffree's, removes from the OTHERWORLDLY MAGICAL FANTASY of the palette
I am in love with so many of the new shades of the liquid lipsticks! Will they be permanent colors and be in the full size?
That Poland inspired mirror 👀
Why tf is his face on it?
Did he skip the 3rd swatch or is it just me
This is boring
Omg I'm so excited about the lipstick vault and the blush pallet.
Uuugghh when are we getting foundation??????
Wow it's been 3 years already?!?!?!
Something is off with jeffree
It would be kl if the package was a first aid kit, just by the name of the package and the name of the colors.
his lips have deflated!
This is so boring. I don't understand the point of launching the same palette twice
As always- it's about himself.
Yes I’m hate watching this. Yes I’m low key ready to see this flop. Yes I’m living for the drama. That is all
Please make like a pink velvet sugar palette with hot pinks, baby pinks, and some BLINDING pink shimmers!
thank you kanye, very hot
My favourite video
Blood Sugar is definitely my most used pallete of all the Jeffree Star ones I have <3 I love it to death
Not Jeffree putting himself on the palette when no one wants to see him 😩
I like the other pallet better I mean the design.
Am i the only one that is kind of freaking out everytime they zoom in his face 👁👄👁 omg his skin looks bad, the wrinckles, i think i never saw him this bad, im way more afraid of getting old now!
Damnit I was hoping for an all pink palette
Hi mommy jeffreeStar im one of ur fan i always watch ur video most of the pallete lunch im from Philippines my dream is to have one of ur pallets bc i have a little pallete here but its fake its not so pigmented i would like to wish from u if i can have one of ur pallete thxx if u notixe thisss keep safe stay fresh always thxxx❤️💗
Jeffree doesn't care about you, he sees you only as a customer to make millions off you, so why do buy his pallets or products?
Sei bellissima 💋💋 vorrei tanto essere come te ❤️❤️
Has everyone forgotten all the cringing and creepy bad stuff this dude has done? Why is he still allowed to be on Utube
There must be an overstock of this pallette hence the attempted relaunch !
Wtf is this shit
These are so beautiful but will a pastel palette ever be made? With baby pinks, sky blues etc?
Ooo pink veins is beautiful!
We need sugar spike in a full size !
You are so beautiful Jeffree ❤️
Are you really going to put yourself on the packaging of everything from now on? I miss the more regal looking aesthetic of your brand, with all the pictures on it it looks cheap.
I would love to see a Jeffery Star x Louis Vuitton makeup collab!!! That would be BOMB!
love the coral highlite for deep skintone
Uff love it all mr.star u are a icon
Why is hair by J still working for you????
So basically if you ready have blood sugar (me) you don't really have a use for this palette.
Damn... His skin be looking aged lately even with pounds of makeup on.
what about a palette for people with white and pink undertone skin ?? :)
I used to buy your products all the time until the quality dropped massively (among all the other reasons I don’t support or buy your stuff anymore). I purchased four of those suits, the Shane Dawson suit was the best quality one....so nice I had fallen in love. So I purchased three more a few months apart and they’ve all been completely different quality. The rainbow suit so far has been the worst, the pants and jacket came all frayed and when I emailed customer service they told me they were out of stock and to mail it back if I didn’t like it. Then I purchased the red suit and blue suit and they’re just trash. I’m really not sure why I’m surprised and why it took me so long to stop purchasing your products. I had to email Beautylish about 5 or 6 times because I would receive palettes missing shades or completely watered down lipsticks.
UMMMMM just my 3¢.... But I can't help but feel the very first Swatch of the new color and it going right in the middle of his palm!?!!?.... Like Stigmata... Like someone being crucified!?!  I can't be the only one that feels that was very delibrate and planned?!?!
....Anyways, yall want something from mcdonald's?
Really thought the 10-pan palette is back but turns out it was a highlighter palette </3
Are we going the route of urban decay now? I'm sleep
How pretty!!  I always thought this was the coolest palette JSC ever made ❤️🤍
the palettes look cheap
why ppl buy this asshole stuff....smh
Unsubscribed 🙄
How’s hair by jay? Hope your enjoying his ugly ass wigs lmao
why are you still working with jay? ew. user.
Para que la quisieras en blanco? Se va a ensuciar más y la pequeña no tiene sentido, esperaba algo diferente
🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
Why are my comments being deleted? Can’t hold a little criticism you crying baby?:(
i no longer support jeffree star :)
You've grown so much as a person, business entrepreneur, millionaire.... ::sigh:: I'm so excited to see your future Miss Jeffre Lynn ♥️♥️
The hoodie and joggers look VERY similar to the James Charles hermanas collection 😳...
I bought a fake Blood Sugar palette for jokes and it is awful. It is the worst palette ever!!
I hate the fact that I lost my Jon and can't afford some of the lipsticks for my graduation look, cus I'm doing a red moment.
Oh Gosh!!! It's a pitty
Hello everyone, I ask for help, I am in a very difficult situation, more details in my personal one. To whom it is not difficult I ask for help if possible 4400 4301 0014 0661
Make an apology, not a palette.
I would never spend my money on anything of this brand knowing how evil the owner is 👎🏻
No one commenting on how his nails are busted
Miss Jeffree that’s a VHS box XD
This creature is so synthetic....
Why is his subscribers count depreciating with the passage of time😭😭😭 it hurts 😭😭😭 I m obsessed with you darling ❤️ love from India🌻
Yes baby
umm so you guys are really here still supporting him?
YOU'RE FINALLY BACK GAAL <3
Hey Jeffree have you noticed that your views have dropped MASSIVELY 😭❤️ well done sweetie. Being evil really does get you nowhere! Peace and love x
Sorry but it's your fault shane has changed i still love you though but i want the old shane back he made feel better about myself but now i don't have any funny new videos to watch to when I'm  sad i love you Jeffery you have a glamorous life
Deleting comments? LOL
Yessssssss HI HOW ARE YAAAAAA ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

So weird seeing him without long ass nails.
Zzzzzzzz.....
Eventually he will be like shane .. nothing
Congratulations- the colors are very beautiful and your voice is so soothing to me. That wig is EVERYTHING!!!
When will JSC be available in South Africa!? 🌍
U look good without the nails . Let them breathe and grow healthy love ❤️ them all
I  AM  SALIVATING !!!!!
Love your channel!!! Check mine out @ de Pluim
Damn that sub count dropped down a bit. I wonder why??
I'm excited for the downfall.
I would probably buy the small palette if it didn’t have Jeffree’s face on it
It's so sad that I've supported you for so long and bought your products without knowing the true content of your character. Lol real mean girl behavior.
❤️🔥💯😍😍🌹♥️♥️👄🎨🖌️🛍️❤️❤️💓
Unrelated topic but you should do a red Bull inspired hair look 💕
2019 sucked for you
Karma will come
Why you look gay not going to lie
His videos are way less personal now and more obviously scripted
Thank god I use ouch almost daily
Please review shein makeup 💛
Hey Jeffree star I was on my husband phone my name is diamond an I was watching one of your old videos from like 9 years ago an you was the top 10 famous  youtubers an you said that be humbling and follow your dreams and dont give up an right now its Feb 23 and my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer and now as of Feb 23 she is currently in the hospital with dubble     Pneumonia and medical bill an chemo treatments an with everything going on I fell like iam in a deep hole and as days go by I feel like iam sinking in but just now was watching your videos an I was literally in tears bc you said if your down dont give up keep going you can accomplish your dreams  an I am a very strong woman but even the strongest person falls some times you made my day just made my day thank you Mr star
I just came by to see how the progress of you being canceled is going
“And it’s literally just a very very UH... it’s just a very white shade” 😩
Omg 😲😱 the minni I'm in love with her too!
Foundation looks horrible. Collection is nice. The views and comments not great. And I’m no longer a fan. The hairbyjay thing was a huge turnoff. Makes me kind of sad. Came here out of nostalgia. Jeffree you really f$cked up. What’s sad is you really don’t give a shit. Just another Money hungry narcissist.
God knows I tried hating you miss mama, tried convincing myself that I hate him, even unsubbed!... biiiihhh! here I am and im here to stay. Good Morniiinnggg!!
We need more shorts! I love mine from the nude launch
Booooooooooooo
Ooop no one cares
Love your hair gorgeous
Pearson though......😛
Cancelled 🤷🏻
Scary looking
People are still buying this bullies makeup, YUCK!!!!
I think you're wrong to call objects by female words. The box is NOT "she." IT is IT. So objectifying of women and girls.
stunning as always <3
I LooooooVe it all!!! I want it, I want it!!! I want the VauLt most!! I have blood sugar, but so tempted to get the special edition Look!!  Yes to the Mini!!! The Extreme frost paLette!!!!! Aghhhhhhh.....❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love it all!!!  ❤️ ♥️ 💜
Why are you working with Jay? Gross
Am I the only one who likes it?
Yass Queen Jeffree is Queen yass
60k Likes and 1M views is anecdotal and illusory. wWake up, Jeffree. Spend fucking money on therapy and stop being such a toxic human being. We all know it, even before... deep down we all know it. Even you..
Loved this one.
Sad how I have no pallets from you 😢
Do people still buy his products? LOL
Look like support is finally falling as it should have long ago.
All I have to say is wtf💀💀💀
Definitely wanted a mini Blood Sugar palette three years ago. Even thought up names and sent it to him. Still think Blood Drop would have been cute AF. I can't stand when brands put their faces on it. Screams lazy and narcissistic. Kylie and Kim do that. It even looked like the same cardboard they used. Wholly underwhelmed. I get it, it's an anniversary thing which also screams cash grab and again, lazy. If I was still a fan, I would possibly consider it but too much has happened. Watched this solely to see if the packaging was still fire at least but whomp whomp.
Everything looks good Hun ❤❤❤

The way you flopped so damn hard

Welp... time for more red lipsticks. 🤣
You are so beautiful
❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍😍
Love your videos, always make me smile!!
Cue the yay!!!!! I am so excited😍
Jeffree Star saying the n word https://youtu.be/FVDk7Xud29U
Will the liquid lips ever be sold separately or do you have to buy the Vault..... I LOVE candy joint and bite my tongue💕
I am scared, i am traumatized, i accidentally watched this and i am scared, i am sitting in my bathroom and breathing heavily, i cant come to my senses, advice would be helpfull, how do i move on like nothing happened?
Queeeeeeeen
Look at all these comments being deleted
As outrageously wealthy as you are, why would you take out a PPP loan? Don't you know those were meant for small businesses so they wouldn't have to close their doors which quite a few ended up doing thanks to money meant for them running out?  Now you have people unable to provide for their families and living out of their cars.  Truly shameful.
Hey Jeffree, I was wondering for your next video would you review Cheekbone Beauty brand? They are a smaller Indigenous owned business and what makes them different is they’re goal is to create a zero waste makeup line. They have zero waste packaging and deserve some recognition for what they are trying to do for the environment! I think every makeup brand should take note 📝
Summer time Pink orange and mint palette call it sherbet melt .. a 18 pan ranging from pastel to neon lol just a thought 🧡💚💗 I'm seeing a 70's theme campaign shoot for the drop..that's just me though
how do people support this guy? the world may never know.
Wish a zodiac palette would be realized soon, but.... I’ll just stay tuned until then 😚 I’ll be tuned in anyways bc I’m obsessed chile anyways so...
what a handsome old man
I still use mine all the time can’t wait for the mini!!
Not a fan of having him on the palette looks VERY tacky. All his other packing looks more luxurious not a fan
I’m use the wig, im going.  Stanford #moya-moya
Literal garbage makeup for a garbage person. Eww
ouch is not in this Platte...
ewwww
Jeffree, I'm bored..
WHERE IS THE ONLY FANS
🇵🇱 is Poland from Europe
Seriously how can u not team up with kesha. Her beautiful face needs your power, beautiful touch. Would benefit both of you. Right there in front of me ... how can't u see that?? 😍
I am shook at the fact that Jeffree doesn't have his nails done! It is refreshing/different!
I’ve always loved jeffree, he’s so positive and honest. And can we admit we ALL make mistakes
So all colors are from the blood sugar so if someone already owns them why get the mini unless they're a big fan and want everything from him. Should of made new colors which matched and went with the big palette
Polish flag on the mirror ❤️
OMG Gorgeous !!!
Iam a Dental Assistant Lovein the Collection!!!! 🌞🌞🌞🌞
ew shane dawson pig stamps 11:11
Love the Blood Sugar Mini Jeffrey !    Fablous The Colors are spot on !!! 🙌❤️🙏🏻
Okay, but his skin doesn’t look very good today.
Do you love the color pink because it relieves your anxiety, stress and anger?
Me and my boyfriend have just broke up Why I post on here... because I love all jeffree star’s videos and it keeps me happy
Cavity is such a horrible name - no good connotations at all.
I notice that his skin doesn’t look very good, and I know he is creating a skin care line so that is worrisome
You going to hell jefree
Ooh I'm deceased 🙆‍♀️💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼💋💋👄💄💄💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻💔👄best combination ever!!;glad you haven't lost you're magic touch with makeup👄👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Hi you gay
Is he a boy or a girl ?
Her face doesnt look the same, or is it just me??
I'd love to see a JSC bath robe 🛀👘
Please review Colour Pop’s Bambi collection
Missed a color .... ouch 🤕
That pink one 😩
i think a pastel colored pallete will be cool. i dont do makeup so i dont know if people will like it tho
I can’t wait till this launches 😍 I got the nude vault and I can’t wait to get this one ❤️😍🥰
Never will buy your products but u just crack me up with your personality.

Cavity lol he's sunning out of idea
Jeffree showing his age with the VCR reference - I laughed (I'm a fellow 30-something ;) )
Jeffrey!!! You are a terrific entrepreneur 💝🎁 I admire your motivation and organization. I think the VCR box is so retro-creative!!Keep up the great work, Bitch 💝😂💝
OMG that’s my favorite color ❤️❤️❤️ 💃💃💃💃💃💃 You look incredible  Totally awesome
Anyone else notices that Miss Jeffree Lyn has even smaller lips than before?   I know he had to remove part of the upper lip since it was hurting him but it seems he decided to make them even smaller  Not throwing shade, that's totally cool, love the natural look
😑😑😑😑
<3 I think this is the one for me.  So gorgeous!
Bloodsugar is my favourite pallet!! I have almost all of them now and the colours in this one are all so pretty.
You are discusting. Everything about you is disturbing.
He went from getting millions and millions of views on his videos to now only getting less then 2 million a video .  Sad but he caused this
Imagine supporting this clown still
Why're the swatches the same photo just photoshopped tho? 15:44 - 'Heart-rate' and 'Heartbeat'
Anniversary Blue Blood ! PLEASE 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻😭
That packing cover photo for the mini is unoriginal lol.
Omggggg can't wait to get this for my birthday Saturday!!
He should release Voldemort palette :D
idk why but this video gave me qvc vibes. not a bad thing, I‘m very much enjoying this kind of entertainment. So ... now yall know
This is so bad. Each release is just getting worse
and they are gone THE EYE BROWS
Ugh why is he always yelling in his videos now? Higher volume doesn’t mean higher energy. His videos feel so awkward and lonely now
Is that Kurt Cobain tatt’d on his chest?
QVC vibes

Gtfoh with changing packaging. That’s lazy ways to make money. He’s following the footsteps of other companies who reuse what they already have out. Nah, a palette which is now with white packaging doesn’t work.  At least the lip vault is not all already released shades but still for as critical as he is of others I would expect better from him as far as products.  The mini palette has one amazing shade.
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Mh, sorry girl but I need to stop watching you, so many people are still brain washed into thinking you’re a good person. I’m starting to wonder when people will wake up... I wish you well.
It would be beautiful to see a donation to the Children’s Diabetes Foundation accompanying the Blood Sugar anniversary collection! 👀😍💖
Love you Jeffree. Can't wait for the new drops
Love 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥the short fresh nails Jefree! Would love to see you so fancy short nails for a switch up!!!✌✌✌✌✌✌💘💘💘💘💘💘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Will you review the new Coach x Sephora pallets?! They look so cute!!!!
That’s what I said. An all pink palette called pink sugar. With pink shimmers and metallics at the top row only and the rest mattes. (Include a soft baby pink and hot pink as well)
JSC packaging is always bomb 🔥🔥🔥
Love all of it. Let me learn to do my makeup first. Are you interested in a date with my friend? 🗯️💖 He is 31 years young.
Can I ask do you have a lipstick with natural shade like if you apply in your lips it make so beautifull ?? In Jeffree product??
Back and the brows are gone 💕
Mean girl. Karma karma karma. It'll happen ,my dear.
This is incredible!!!! Wish I could get them in South Africa
jeffree what happened to letting your eyebrows grow out in the last vid you made you said youd let them grow😩☝️
JS sells me like QVC HSN on pharmaceuticals 💕
I can’t put my finger on it but something is wrong with Jeffrey, he doesn’t look too healthy
Everything is “my favorite I’ve ever done”  He looks so tired.
Views and sells are dropping
Omg i love the wisdom color! I have the blood sugar palette but will def buy a mini version because of the wisdom color is freaking beautiful!
Sad...
You look amazing as always! And the colors are Perfect💝 👌
hate to say it, but jeffree knows his marketing/design-work
I like the lipsticks but it's hard to tell the red colors apart not cuz they look similar I just cant tell the tad color difference between color shades. Love the collection
You're only as good as the company you keep. This makes me so sad...
it’s extremely cringe when influencer say people have been asking for something by constantly messaging them! 🤣🤣 Even if it’s true it’s kinda off putting because so many influencer say that the comment holds no ground anymore😂😬
We’re questioning your character, not the quality of your makeup ❤️
Biiiiitch, I gotta have that mini,  just for that middle shade 😍😍😍, also want it ALL😍😍😍
🥱
I wish I could get Candy Joint by itself. 💔
I feel like we need a new family collection! A nice neutral pallete/collection based off the dogs with a POP of Jeffree. I feel like it would be perfect
Is anyone in the dental field gonna acknowledge the air water syringe in the high speed 😂??
Your package is everything!!! I love it!! Congratulations so proud of u!!
I’m a dental assistant and I NEED that cavity palette 😍😍
A shade named Misery? I need ittt. My name is a different spelling of Misery haha
humbling him with the less views 🫀
Can we get Candy Joint sold as a single pls   🍭💖
I hateeeee this launch, it is so tacky
Repulsive.. why is this crap showing up in my “related” from Kendall Rae murder mystery stories.
Soooo I’m going to need candy joint in a single lipstick please 💗
Please adopt me lol 😫
ppl will forgive him because they like his makeup huh
Jeffreee bitchh we need a pink palette

Candy joint ..... a need
Wow pretty
Jeffree- I have every single palette and almost all lip collections you have ever released. I'm so sorry that I cannot purchase this special palette and collection. C19 and being laid off have deeply affected me and my family. To admit we're struggling- Fuck. That's an understatement. I will cheer you on from the sidelines and I'm proud of you for the success of this history making, gorgeous art. Thank you for inspiring me to keep going. Things are hard right now but it will get better, hopefully soon. I hope everyone loves this collection. I never thought I'd be crying over a palette but here we are.  Praying for everyone in Texas and across the world. Stay safe and stay warm. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
That wig is sick. Wig!!!
so many gorgeous colors, shared @tisonlyme143
Love wifey and all the berry colors. Also our inhalers match!
hi I love you
I love the mini version of the blood sugar palette 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Ik he’s “canceled” but I’m literally obsessed 😭
please stop buying from him
I knew something is missing...and that's Jeffree's nails 😂
I’m going to need Candy Joint to stay in the permanent line ❤️
Reckon he will have a shade called ‘Pay-my-bills-tas’ on his next palette?
Pierson looks so yummy on that packaging and that highlighter pallet is to die for
Looking at the views compared to the release and other videos, Cancelled comes to mind xoxo
Bruhhhh why did I think Jeffrey had on some type of dress with big hips in the thumbnail I was like oh cute but then I realized his legs are open 🙃
am I the only one thinking Wandavision??
Love the sweats looks so cunffie
Amazing love the names Butiful colors
I feel like Wisdom is doing what Bleeding Heart tried to do in the Blood Lust palette
his skin is starting to look so bad
i am honestly so impressed yet again by the quality, you are amazinggggg <3
Pink palette next please 🥰
The vault tho 💄😍😍
Sis rly said here’s a V Day themed collection AFTER V Day , oh and it’s the same shit I’ve released already just tweaked a little bit🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 wtf um no
Girl it’s embarrassing people used to be freaking out abt this shit and now here you are with a cute 1 million views on ur big palette reveal 💀 ain’t nobody gaf about you anymore
Am I the only one that realised that he didn’t swatch the third shade in the mini
레드 레드  ❤❤
Holy shit this comment section has been so filtered
Candy is so beautiful when is it coming to New Zealand, OMFG Absolutely Stunning!
Big gau
Mind of a creative genius
yasssss i actually prefer mini palette i’m more likely to pull them out from all my palettes  to use and great for travel 😁
How are there SO many positive comments?? Someone must be filtering/deleting...
He is still cancelled? Just in case.. *Close the video*
Yyou should make hair dye tooo- idk, like ik ur makeup but id trust u witt hair somehow tooo loll
Y’all still stan him 🤢
I NEED the liquid lip vault OMFGGG!!
Oh yeah, the mini is perfect. Great idea.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 oh my you made the red lippies i wanted! OMG I WANT IT!!!!
THE PACKAGING!!!!! HELLOOO
Beautiful
Omg those liquid lipstiiiicks😍
I think what I see  Jeffree, is how you are going to stay relevant. I love you and you being different from most is great and one step up. But a lot is coming on scene. I really wasn't impressed with this line. Only because not my color. But hope you can keep your makeup on top.
why is he still a thing..
Were did his lips go?
Check out his views plummet. Cancelled
I’m not into these kinds of videos cause I’m a dude but this whole thing Jeffree has going on here is strange. Who would’ve thought years ago that one day people would be idolizing a man dressed as a woman, having extreme cosmetic surgery, wearing and selling makeup? I don’t mean to be judge mental seriously but these times are weird and this kind of stuff is going to get more extreme.
Jefree I'm desperately waiting for a pink pallet. Is a pink pallet in the works?
Feels desperate
I will not buy more Jeffree Star Cosmetics, I will not buy more Jeffree Star Cosmetics..... At least not till Blood Pressure is released 🤐😁
Sugar spike is pretty
love red!!! yummmm !
God I miss watching u ! I love you so much ! My sister committed suicide and things have been hard but makeup is my escape and I have missed that last few pallets I need them so bad I miss you ❤️❤️❤️
can Jeff make a video that isn't just asking for our money. can he just do a fun video comee onnnn
As someone who just got their wisdom teeth out I can relate
Up to this day y’all are still kissing jeffree’s ass. I hate cancel culture but y’all are not holding the people that should be held accountable lmaooooo
So someone who only pops up on YouTube to post videos a week before they launch a product?  We see you Jaclyn Star and we're not interested.  #yawn
OMG! I love the MINI!!! 💉🩸🍬💋🥀💯❤  I just love the entire new frost pallet and the lip vault collection 😍 OMG! Love it all! Love you Jeffree!!! 💫💫💫
Ouch 🥺
Jeffree you should review the Alicia keys skincare :)
My period every month:
I think that he meant to design it like a VHS not VCR lol 😂 it’s been a while since they’ve existed so it’s OK that he mixed it up lol
LOVE the White!
*Me:* has never applied makeup correctly or consistently in my life... *Also Me:* i'll never wear this, but damn it's so pretty! So glamorous for when nobody can see my face under my mask and glasses....ahha!
Can we make Misery a single shade?!? I’ve been wanting a deep burgundy lip from JSC!!!
I'm definitely getting the highlighting pallet cause it looks  SICKENING!!!!
What is he wearing
i might buy this purely for Glucose because i hit pan on it it’s the purest white eyeshadow i’ve ever used  no 🧢
Blue Blood mini, PLS!!!!!!!!
I love everything🤍🩸
This vampire looking like a Steven universe character loool
Ya know man I am just legit so happy to see how proud and happy Jeffree is!❤❤
The highlighter palette looks cheap to me
i’m so confused
Tryna get the white packaging pallette for collection purposes only, too gorgeous to ruin🤍❤️
I don't use make up at all, but I watch all your videos, I love your aesthetics ❤️
Can you do something actually new yet?
WE NEED NAIL POLISH JEFFREE
Jeffree you need to make a RAINBOW palette with your formula and all colorful I’d love to see that🤞🏼
Why didn't he release this on vday?
I've got a good bit of your products in my collection,  but jeffree....can I get a pink version? Pinks, peaches, pastel colors....ugh I'd die
I was actually wondering where your eye brows are... you said you were gonna grow them out?
He looks sad . Like his behavior isn't matching his emotions
I love jeffree without nails❤️
Is that 10 am pst est or what?
We need more comedy. Ur so funny
Misery omg for a girl that doesn't wear red, i love love love it, beautiful collection
The blood sugar minis 😍
Are we not gonna talk about how that foundation aged Jeffree?
I can't even blend eyeshadow but here I am
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
This person is terrible, all the money in the world can’t buy good taste
Anyone else remember the original fire starter? This isn't new.
I've never bought a single thing from Js but im bodda get this whole thannnng!!!!
Can you start releasing the limited edition shades individually full size for a limited time? Because my lips go thru the minis really quick if I adore the color 🥺🥺🥺
Love youuuuu 💗💗💗💗

I hate palettes that have peoples faces on it. Ew.
February 26th is my birthday I’ll get to share it with you! Hello from texas❤️
❤️❤️❤️
#Canceled
You suck
Yessssss
You should make a starter kit! 🦄
Now we know why his last elf makeup review was so half assed and rushed. He was just getting ready for another promo vid for his new makeup.
what happened to Anna Nicole??? did u rename it??? feels like it should be in there
Holy pigment Batman!
Oh my goodness, I love it all!! I told my hubby I want the mini and the jogger set for my birthday!! It's all so beautiful, like always!
Friend: "Omg what a very bright red shade of gloss on ya lips ya got today! What is it?"   Jeffree: "I call this one, Divorced & Depressed Kanye Urethra. Oh and yes it is organic"   Friend: "😳"
THE RED THEME IS SO GOOD ON HIM
I’m right on top of that, Rose.  Anyone???
I just want to know how jeffree⭐ became sooooooooooooooooo rich!!!!!!!!! 😮
Blood Sugar is my favorite palette of all time! So excited for the new products!
the lip color vault is fucking perfect. You are my favorite. Please take my money and give me all the gorgeous pretties
Drinking game for how many times he says “of course” 😜😜😜
You’re annoying
Pink pallet please with pale pinks and all tones!! A miss monochrome moment!
No
READ THE ROOM!  Jeffree Star isn’t worth the slime on your shoes. He is trash, vile, hate filled, jealous and disgusting on all accounts. Buy real makeup from people that really care because he ain’t it!
I love you jeffree ♥️👑
Now I know what I want for my birthday
Think about it  Jeffree Starr and Adam Lambert 🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍😍
超可愛い
Lalisa Manoban yaaalll
What about beauty killer? Will she get a makeover too?
i thought he was grwing out his eyebrows... anyways... he still slays
Just need single eyeshadows next! 🙏🙏🙏 Waiting for customisable palettes!! 🤩
Ahhhhh not to clock you but it’s a VHS packaging not VCR 🤣
Nice
Whoever that lip model is, her teeth and lips are gorg!!
Name suggestions for future palettes and their shades Green: Name- Toxic Lust.  Shades: Poison Ivy, Lime, Tetnis, Injection, Radioactive, Regime etc. Pink: Name- Bad Romance (romance because it's along the lines of lust) Shades- : Heartbroken, Starstruck, Heartache, Moan, Saturated etc. Yellow: Name- Sour Sugar Shades: Citrus, Keen, Bittersweet, Lemondrop, etc. Tehe
The last few videos. Something is up. He's different. His mannerisms, the tone, idk. Something is definitely going on in the star mansion I'm pretty sure. He just looks like he's "getting it done and getting through it" the last few months, no matter what he talks on.
You’ve done reds already! Move on! We’re all waiting for something new, not old ideas repackaged 😠😠😠
How can one person have this much personality?! Haha I'm not gonna lie, Jeffree has a really good personality & he always puts a smile on my face lol
Make a yellow palette names Sour Lust, Citrus Sugar or Sour Sugar. Full of vibrant yellows to shimmering golds with a duo chrome yellow and green shade that would be almost everything
♥️
why is everyone in this comment section being so nice n clingy do yall not know that jeffree is cancelled
At this point,  I honestly think Jeffree is in it for the money only now. He’s been launching more than before now; I get it, he needs to make a living. But we’re in the middle of a pandemic and no one can afford this atm. He should just wait till everyone is in a better situation.
I need misery by itself!!
I dunno, that highlighter makes Jeffree's million dollar skin look textured. How will it translate to regular skin? The mini is cute, though.
Where are the negative comments
Dam the eyebrows didn’t last long haha
Just take my money... I need that vault!
@Jeffreystar Girl, did you say VCR or VHS? I wonder what she would play?  ;) Shout out to the 80's Babies!
😍😍😍
Preise tell me Thatcher the vault will be available at beauty bay
I’m waiting for a true Neon Rainbow Palette. I know Jawbreaker was technically a rainbow palette but I’m looking for the most vibrant neon rainbow palette that you’d expect from JSC.
Pops of color against elegant dark wear helps others shine as well. And nature.
JEFFREEEEEE this look is EVERYTHING
I love this...
I love the movie Ever After.
My gold/beige slippers went missing just like my ruby ones and the rest.  Stunning palette.
Yeah literally today I am about to get all of my teeth pulled and fake ones put in.....uncanny truly
Jeffree Star. Like everyone says, you should totally do a pinks eyeshadow palette and mini pallette and it should be called the Dreamhouse pallette. :)
You look gorgeous, honey!!!
Beautiful!!!!!❤❤❤
Love it girl!!!!!!!!
You must be ashamed to be a man that you have to act like that can even accept the real you
It's so much like the blood sugar shades
Will there be full sizes of the liquid lips in the vault?
Gorgeous!!
That Super Bowl-style JSC ring is everything.
It’s beautiful and I’m so happy to see you celebrating your creation! Happy anniversary.
This guy probably eats kids in its mansion
for blue bloods anniversary you should make a bluetooth palette
Hope yall are enjoying your palettes in your rented homes. 🤣
The highlighter palette!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OH MY GOODNESS.... 😳😍💕💞💟
I need the highlighter!!!!!
If you're wondering why Jeffree is launching a lot of products well... I smell JFC makeup stores opening soon 👀
Please do pink pallet already with some waterproof eyeliner
Never pop up in my recommendations again
Who needs marketing when you’ve got JS,I’d seriously buy shit if he was selling it lol
Am i the only one who thinks the pigments are a little sheer? 🤔
"wanted to bring something new" *anniversary collection* bro shut uuuuuppp
No nails Jeffree....I’m shook!
If there’s crazy traffic on tha website on tha 26th....where’s tha next best place to buy tha collection?
Ummm jeffree why did you literally not swatch the ONLY dark skin nude in the mini pallet? After 5:12-5:22 he just skips over it At 7:29 there's no dark skin swatch to be found and he doesn't go back
What is Jeffree wearing on his lips?
Your hands look naked without the long nails especially since the video was centered on your hands. You could have slapped on some press-ons for this launch. You didn't even have to glue them on for the few hours it took to film this commercial.
IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A SHADE LIKE MISERY FROM OTHER BRANDS. THANK THE LIQUID LIP LORDS!
I only want three lippies out of the whole collection 😭
Gayyyy.....
Pls do rare make up review
Okay but seriously... i NEED candy joint in a full-size liquid lip 😍😍😍 i love this collection!
Nice infomercial vibes
The new trunk should been BUBBLE GUM PINK!
who even supports this anymore
Kinda wish the mini palette had Cavity in it, that is my favourite shade ever and would give it a bit more versatility.
I use Glucose for my base so I ran out almost immediately after getting 😂 wish I could buy that shade by itself! ❤
Okay but why does his voice sound different 🤔🤔🤭
hey lets forgive someones sociopathic manipulative bad shit cuz they got new pallett 💅💁‍♀️💅💁‍♀️💁‍♀️ you people are genuenly pathetic.
I love the mini and the colors, definitely such beautiful eyeshadow colors 😍 The only thing I don't really care for is when someone puts their face on products though
literally the best palette change my mind
Restock the mini orgy
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
hi
i literlly dont wear any makeup and im a bi male but i just watch all of jeffree vids anyone the same ha  ❤ ya
Great makeup but shitty personality
Girllll...Where are the beautiful browss  T~T
Omg in the close up you see his wrinkles 😂 daaamn he is over and old 😬 His Make-up is still bomb tho
Palette ideas: All yellow palette called Bloody Sunshine/ Blood Diamond, all pink palette called Sugar Baby and an orange palette called Blood spatter/ Blood in the water/ Blood drive.
Anyone else just feel like this is a huge cash grab when it comes to the big palette? And the mini. Kinda wishing it was a pink palette
@ 10.14 - yes, because as we all know & remember the video evidence and testimonials; JS has always been a consciously sensitive and aware brand / person championing inclusivity for "medium to dark complexions" [sans acid].
Very Polish Vibe - national flag colour ;)
Whoever is the lip model she’s gorgeous✨
Love it wisdom is awesome
🤢🤢🤮🤮
He looked like a red ranger in that thumbnail
can anyone buy me the mini please ?! thank you !!
Jeffree where are your nails??
not materialistic at all!!  https://youtu.be/pKRmaJXch6I
I would absolutely love a pink and lilac pallet. We’ve got spring and summer coming would be perfect
Nice make up. Sad the the creator isn’t the same
He looks really worn down and tired to me here. Jeffree take care of yourself! I'll be getting the mini and highligher. The vault is pretty but just has too much I won't wear. I don't do much red on my lips.
I m getting all that for my daughter 👍❤️
Please release all nude pallet from very light brown to dark brown, same with shimmer shadows.
Just stop
I loved everything!
Pink palette plz
wait did Jeffrey not swatch ouch? 🤕
So much LOVE in all of your palettes. 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Looking good like always sis 🔥
Nice.
😍😍😍😍😍
Even though I am a Dental Hygienist, I will still be purchasing the Cavity Palette. 🦷 Brush & Floss 🪥✨
he really be looking like daniella mondragon lmfao where are the filipino viewers
Packaging is cheap as hell looking.
I kinda now feel like its outdated and exhausting to watch people be so extra
Only 8 shades are swatched? .. or I’m blind?
🙃
The eyeshadow palette....nahhh....The highlighter palette....nah....The lipstick vault....gimme gimme!!!
Hey any sugar daddies out there help a gurl out 🙈🙈😂😂😂
Want that palette and a green one to :(. Red to me is passion, blood, thorns and horns
Damn Jeffree, what's going on with that skin or foundation at 8:14 to 8:24?  you got cracks happening and shit.  You need to get not hat gurl before people start asking for a Foundation called "Armor" and you showing them the cracks in it!
I want a palette with pinks and vibrant greens and opalescent hues. Get some duochromes & unicorn highlighter vibes.
He didn’t have nails when he released the first Blood Sugar Collection either.
Do people wear this colors?
Lives every day in a mask... Also Me:.needs Misery liquid lip in order to survive.
Hi sisters this is my Chanel Yotube
I'm a newbie with make up. I wish, I knew everything I need to know.
Ok #jeffreestar or @jeffreestar n I hope this actually tags you or you read this. My nephew got me turned in to your formula however I am a single mom of 4 and it’s taken me 8 months of saving and even using afterpay to place an order finally from your cosmetics site. I was so happy I could finally afford even a few pallets and a lip bundle and mirror and my order came to $226. That is a lot for a single mom to even spend and had j even known about this launch I might have waited, but nevertheless I ordered on January 28th, I checked my route app at 4am and it said my pkg was still in Cali, I went to work and checked my email when I was leaving and noticed I got an email my pkg was delivered which j thought was super fast coming the same day from Cali. Now I don’t live in the best neighborhood and I called my son and he said there was no pkg on the porch when he got home n j checked with my carrier and my neighbors and no one really saw anything or got it, my carrier left it on my porch in front of my home where anyone can see my pkg instead of in front of the door where it cannot be seen. I’ve literally been in tears as it’s been almost a month and not only do j not have my makeup but usps has paid ur company $100 bc that’s all the insurance they put on my pkg when u have to order $125 just to get free insured shipping and there is no option for me the buyer to add more insurance which it should have bc $100 isn’t even covering half of the pkg. my email is barbpayo@gmail.com and shit my phone number is 14129323682. I know u likely have millions of ppl wanting u to call them but I really just obviously never wanna order from your company again, like to already get refunded for what the company did insure n had to fill out another doc thru your company which I did do but couldn’t get a email back in over 3 days!! I’m not even sure if everything I ordered is available which is why at this point I kinda just want a refund and if I choose to support the brand, order it from beautylish so shipping is free and I can insure anything I buy bc I never know if someone else will get a pkg or someone just steals it bc I’m not home. So the company tried saying at first they aren’t liable however they are bc they didn’t offer me additional insurance on what I purchased. This whole experience has been a nightmare and I hear stories that you actually donate your products to single moms like me n your company is literally robbing a single mom for that kind of money!! I mean if u can reach out I will give h every bit of details from my order but, GIRL, I’m passed having a heart attack and just distraught about this. I thought 2021 would be better. Covid, I lost my mother last year, I’ve turned to makeup for comfort and I got totally screwed by JSC. It’s not fair at all and nothing ever goes right in my life but if it did maybe I’ll wake up tomorrow to you on my front porch with like every one of your products bc I know how amazing they are as I’ve used my nephews pallets and lippies but I just wanted to do something for me for once and it got me nowhere and I don’t have another $226 to go buy the same things j already paid for!!! Please help!!!! Anyone reading this with a heart please share this so Jeffree himself sees this bc if anyone can fix a problem at JSC it’s JS him self!! I still love you Jeffree also, I’m just very hurt by the company and how they are handling your brand, your baby. They have not been helpful in any way shape or form! TIA to anyone that makes sure he sees this, bless you, and bless you all! —Barbie Dee
SNAP we already knew the last video was just to soften us up for another launch.
Can you do single shades of every colour in every palette please.
All pastel palette and or all neons. But pastels would be great for spring. Not into his face on the palettes and just wish blood lust was in a trunk! I absolutely hate the packaging on that pallet lol it doesn’t fit or stack or ughhh  😂
I love you Jeffree... But I need mascara!!!! Give me mascara!!!!
I literally only use Colourpop's Coconuts palette.  That's all I need.  Colorful palettes make me look like a clown.
stop!! As a girl with dyed burgundy red hair, I really only wear mauve nude lips or red lipstick and I absolutely NEED the lip vault!! So many perfect reds I can’t!!
It’s just me? I have this feeling like am forgetting Him
Jefffreeee it’s not a VCR unicarton it’s VHS ;)
I want the mini and cavity palette and liquid lips but I have so much makeup and no where to go😫
Oh it's releasing on my 23rd birthday and I'm broke....im officially sad
are you a boy or a girl because your type is like a boy
I wish he had better style... he looks like a woman in their 70s trying to look 48... he needs a more youth style
Ngl I didn’t like the cameraman again also the weird zoom and lack of eye contact was weird
Looks like he gave up on the eyebrows again
That mini is honestly perfect for on the go
Does anyone even care anymore
Use to say, "it takes forever to make a collection.."  ..comes out with a new collection every month.
I love the collection but am I the only one that is just staring at his cracked foundation 😏😩
Why his lips look so small?
Yasss gaga slayer honeslt i love this pallete the haus these colors r just so fabulous  I am so gagged the haus
He used to get way more views damn what happened
I don’t wear make up but i love to have this🤩🤩
Ummm what is worth w your hair love
All of the red in this video is killing my eyes
I want my life to be surrounded by Candy Floss (shade AND snack!!) 24/7. I cannot wait for the mini and the frost palette!! Will the new minis ever have their own full size liquid lip or exclusively in vault? Thank you for some new beauties to add to the collection ❤️❤️❤️
Im hoping I can use this pallet.The warnings on all the  jeffy eye shadows I've bought say (not permitted around the eye area.)
The fact that his collection is being launched on my 🎉BIRTHDAY🎉 can’t wait to use his pallets and many more.
his skin is so... uhhh no
And I LOVE your new Supreme Gloss. I will order more of those as well
Just here to remind y'all Jeffree star has not changed and is still a trash person who's taken no responsibility for his actions ok bye
He’s really missing his opportunity for a blood money palette.
Jeffree i wish you all the best. After everything you have been through i dont know how you keep going. I wish i had your drive. As a fellow scorpio i always will have your back. Wish you a great 2021
you should have been pale skinned for this the tan doesnt look right with the hair
So sad, it’s not new colors, but still super cute!
I love that Wisdom color. I will buy the palette just for that shade!
love the lippie trunk..arrrffff
the mini blood sugar swatches look awful lol
We can't deny his talent and artistry and good quality makeup but I just can't fool myself and buy any because I'll feel so bad because of what he did in those 2 years and before it just doesn't process with me I wish he was a better person more than a better producer
not to rush u or anything but i think u should do a toxic collection with neon greens whites purples blacks grey’s i just thought it would be a good idea it’s ok if u already did one i wish i could get some of ur pallets i would die to get one of them i don’t have much money as it is but good luck with the new pallets! ❤️
Is no one else going to mention that Jeffree got so excited that he forgot to swatch Ouch?  LOL
Sorry my finger print that was good 😌
Jeffreeeeeeee you’re trying to break my bank account with the red vault lip 🥺
Omg I’m a jeffree stan and a jeffree star cosmetics Stan!!! Love you forever!
BUBBLEGUM palette 👁👄👁
IM OBSESSED with the skin frost highlight palette!!!!
I liked combinación of colors in the pallet, and lip sticks allá of them are beautiful
you should do a pink pallete i would buy in a heart beat. honestly i would buy like 5 lmao
I made up "*crickets*"
Loving the Red ❤️💋🌹😍
Prick is a beautiful lip shade
Definitely not impressed with the cameraman on this video!!
didn't you shame james for making a mini version of his palette?
Why did you take a PPP loan? I thought that was saved for businesses about to close down. You took money from people who could have really used the money. Surprised not enough people are talking about the selfishness. 👎🏼
Anybody here from the TikTok about him not getting a lot of views anymore
Ugh why do I always gotta be broke when he releases!!
I hope u see this U r an amazing person and ur makeup is unbelievable I dont personally have any I'm a 13 year old but my cousin is a huge fan and I hope u keep up the amazing work slay it queen
I cant be the only one who thinks Jeffrey star looks clapped af in this video
I think we shouldve gone with all new shades jeff. Maybe just me? I wouldve bought, but nope... underwhelmed thanks though. Still live you
YouTube unsubscribed me from you! I never unfollowed you like what the hell....
Cherry soda, forbidden fruit
the red hair is everything
We ain’t forgot about the Jamie charl situation
I love candy joint and the blush/highlight ✨
honestly blood sugar is the worst pallette i own, all the red shades (ironically) are chalky and terribly sheer and the metallics look dusty and matte. if yall still choose to support jsc in 2021, buy this mini instead
https://youtu.be/cHsBqL5p3Ro
Bite my tongue and misery needs to be offered full size!!!
u make me wanna do my makeup everyday.
I noticed in this video Jeffree Star forgot to do long nails. However, it is very neatly groomed.
Is it just me or does jeffree drop a new product every month ?
You’re “fans” are pawns for you’re monitory gain and the monopoly held over subscriber count and sweatshop makeup!
no ❤️
PLEASE DO A REVIEW ON THE L’Oreal Infallible 24 hour fresh wear foundation in a powder!! It’s everywhere and supposed to be amazing! Love you and your videos!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
“I’m obsessed with prick”  - Jeffree Star 2021
So no ones gonna talk about the fact that he’s blatantly capitalizing off of Type 1 Diabetics by naming a pallet “Blood Sugar” that has color names like “Intravenous” “Prick” “Ouch” and “Coma” And all for the sake of what?? An aesthetic? Are you fr?!. Could you be any more insensitive?
Jefferee: “They’re delicious” Me: did you taste them?
I hate that Jeffree is all over the packaging bc I love the art they come up with in the palettes not photos from the shoot that’s what IG is for lol
HI I LOVE YOU ALL WAYS Jeffrey star good job
Oh hell YES 🙌🏽 I’m definitely gettin some, the mini and the skin frost highlighter palette ✨♥️💃🏻❤️✨
Gorgeous! We expect nothing less from Jeffree!
Misery full size PLEASE
Candy joint is bomb, full size? I cannot afford the vaults...
Are you kidding me, only one new shade?! Is this a prank. I am loyal but not rich or dumb. That shade looks good but sorry sis, no!  In my humble, irrelevant, opinion... The mini SHOULD have all new shades that way we can buy both and it not be a waste.  Ok third edit, btch I was so excited thinking CAVITY WAS A NEW EYE PALLET..... I AM TOTALLY LET DOWN BY THIS WHOLE REVEAL....
10:00 look at his wrinkles....
It's launching on my birthday 😊😊😊
How pedestrian.
Congratulations!!!
The only type of sugar I’m ready to consume
The red lip shades are dynamite 😍😍
Are the 16 new colors in the mini lip vault going to be available in full size velour liquid lips?? I love so many of the new shades I can’t even remember them all 🔥❤️
this look so bad ma
Nah Hes defo deleting comments
I'm SHOCK with JS's nails LOL
Where is Madison?? Does she still work For you??
From 16.7 M to 16.6 M?
Sad. He barely getting views now
Where is the INNOVATION? If you claim to be the “best”, honey you need to prove it. I want like NEON. Maybe even black light reactive or like glow in the dark pigments? They exist and if he was to remain on top quality wise he has to deliver something new. I am a makeup artist and dream of having my own line. But I would never ever just keep the same ish for multiple collections. If I had a line, and the money he does to invest in it, I would be researching how to innovate the industry as a whole. Have we ever seen an eye shadow that has actual texture like, for example, velvet, beads, large metallic flakes? No! Have we ever seen a complexion product that has live cultures to eat impurities off your skin while you wear it throughout the day? NO! This is the innovative thinking we need. Yes he has a pigmented formula, but at this point, he has become so comfortable with it that he is just being lazy. The beauty industry has SOOOOO much room and opportunities to take on innovation that would revolutionize the game. The shadow we put on our eyes has been the same effect for decades, though the pigments have gotten better, that’s the only thing that has changed! If fibers can be eye-safe in mascara, why not apply that to a showdown to really, TRULY, create something that changes the game? I have invested so much money on JSC, have every pallet, but looking at them as a whole, the only true innovation I see is his growth in packaging (the introduction of trunks as shadow components.)
I'll never be  Abel to afford this palette ;"c
If it sells out will you restock or is it limited supply?
Jefree Star thinking what drama to start lmao
What happened to his views though ?
Forbidden Love and Misery are my faves
WE NEED A PINK PALETTE!!! 😍😍😍
Obsessed 🤩
anyone here from Frenemies?
i wonder what JVN thinks of J*
I just re-watched Morgan's video in 2019 where she introduced Cheeto and Cookie and I saw Jeffree's new palette in her video.
Mama u fir got to swatch the 3rd color top row most brown looking color😥 but the new red is GORG
Oh wow, makeup like everyone else has...A bunch of overpriced junk, cheap looking cardboard boxes made in China. Please put your balls back on and stop the BS!
is anyone else hearing willy wonky every now and again in jeffree’s voice? cause i sure do 😂
The palette is beautiful!!🥰🤩🤩🤩🤩
Love this!!
I love his eye shadows.
This is so cheesy!!!!
The irony that Jeffree released this video the same day I went to the dentist and learned I need to have a filling is not lost on me..
I have the same inhaler!🤣🤣
The new blood sugar ( PALLET)) !! Why does he YELL !! Haha
Im so glad he's been back to doing the up close and personal reveals for the past couple launches <3
Is there new videographer/editor? Feels basic and I'm feeling car sick
I like the old packaging with no face on it.
I need glucose in a single pan literally more than anything else in life rn
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
love this 💕
Where is the foundation ?
Where’s all the YAYYYYYYSSSS in the video? Did he get a new editor?
Launching on my 30th birthday!
I need misery for my wedding!!! Would anyone be willing to sell it to me!?!? Or even better.... Jeffree! I need this for my wedding!!! I'm going to cry if I can't get it 😭😭
Jeffree. It's time for a clothing line. Period.
Love his product hope i can get my hands on them one day🤷🏽‍♀️ again
Just coming here to remind everyone not to buy it ❤️☺️
Should of been called Blood Fart
Omg I love all the new lips gonna be hard to choose !!!! Hope theres a bundle of just the new ones.... Lovin the merch jeff.... im in the medical field this is great , and all the girls at work know I love ur makeup and merch .... lol  thank god the launch is on pay day the hard part is what to get ,want it all but momma on a budget.. lol
I have this pallette and always bake her a cake on her anniversary/birthday
Jeffrey you are the BEST! Love ❤️ looooooove your makeup line ! I want all !!
If you've watched so many videos of Jeffree, you'd probably pick up his speech pattern by now and know what he'll say next lol. It's so funny how I can like "predict" what he'll say next because I've been so familiar with the nuances of his videos.
Mini palette is so stupid. No for duplicate shades 👎
I miss seeing videos of your actual life...
I wish we were taken through the process
😃
it’s been a day & this video hasn’t even hit 1M views.. yikes
Those poor cheeks. In the south we would say his skin looks "rode hard and put up wet."
Omg red on you  omg pretty
That lip vault is KILLER. I love every single color
as a goth, i want bite my tongue and misery <3 i hope they sell solo <3
💗PINK. PALETTE. PRETTY. PLEASE. 💗
Jeffree, are those cheeks new? Love it!
Ahh I am obsessed 😍
"Ouch" from the mini wasn't shown
La Capitana Star ⭐️
Jeffree packaging always stunning 😭❤️
I like peachy pinks. I feel like it's hard for me to find the right peachy pink.
As a dentist  🦷 , I know that I really need the collection!!!!
Nobody gonna mention the fact that he only swatched 8 out of 9 colors? He skipped over Ouch. 👀
Wait. VCR? Or VHS?
I need to know what lashes those are
We want shimmer nudes and golds !!!!!
for as rich as he is u would think he could get better wigs
Jeffrey and the nails girl
OMG? Honestly? First of all, Y'all don't want to know God if you follow this confused creature. Secondly, there's nothing honest about anything in this pitiful community.
The ppl from Poland be like 👁👄👁
I love how this floped
Shout-out to whoever on the J.Star team is editing this comment section... working overtime today!
his formula for his eyeshadows is sooo overpriced. it’s actually one of the worst.....the conspiracy mini is just terrible.
Vampiric creature of the abyss. Endless torment awaits you. Many souls have gone astray watching this satanic inspired distraction.
Love all of it ❤️
No one is buying your makeup. Give it up.
I hope wisdom can be purchased separately, but otherwise still a killer range
OMG those reds are to die for.. I have never been able to afford your cosmetics, but I am thinking I for sure need this..
conspiracy broke the internet. that was INSANE!! anyway, congrats on the blood sugar anniversary!!
i should release a pink and yellow palette that is the shape of a star and on the top it be a bright yellow and say jeffree star cosmetics in pinks and have a bunch of pink and yellow shades!!!
I just bought some products last week, I'm not hating, But this feels so unnecessary. A 3yr anniversary isn't a milestone deserving of a new product/line, especially considering how recently the last 2 product lines came out.
Anybody else notice Jeffrey didn't swatch the 3rd color on the 1st row so only 8 of the 9 shades were swatched
if you want to be like jeffree, just wear a wig with bangs
Does it hurt to know Trisha’s weekly podcast gets more views than your product launch videos now? Oh well. 🤷🏼‍♀️
of course.
Jeffree forgot to swatch “ouch” from the blood sugar mini 😢
New drinking game: drink every time Jeffree says “of course” 🍻💕
Christ is coming soon ! Repent and build a relationship with him before it’s too late! He loves you but these satanic idols don’t care about any of you. Wake up, do your research, repent, read your Bible, and pray before it’s too late.   2 Timothy 3:1-5 ESV  But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people.  Matthew 24:42-44 ESV   Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
I don't know if it's the wig or the make up.. But he literally looks like he is 50 yrs old in this vid.
Just take all my money jeffree 😩😩😩 the vault is perfection ❤️❤️❤️
Omg I luv your products maybe one day I can afford some more!!!
I would want the new shade from the mini palette in a single so I don’t have to get the mini bc I already have the original palette
I feel like all his launches still feel very 2015. I don’t see growth with him as a person or within his cosmetic line
What’s your lip combo in this video it’s so stunning
The shade was already sw4tched
Shit collection borringgggggg
that packaging is so tawdry
Ouch was the color I wanted to see.....and he never swatched it....
fl 0p
It was smart to stretch out pallets experience for anniversary. BUT IF SHE CAN MARKET SOME KIND OF THEME PALLETE EX. Military vibe pallete . WITH SILVER GUN METAL. MATTE GUN BLACK. WARNING YELLOW. FIRE EXPLOSION REDS ORANGES AND YELLOW. TRIATIC COLORS. all the greens and dessert. Night scope green. Girlfriend gun pink and purple. Taze white. Idk. Lol but themes like that. A whole fantasy and experience with mismatched colors that fit the theme. I just for some reason had military type theme. With things like peace white gay soldier rainbow line of colors for highlight. Idk. But how fkn bad ass would that be tho hahaha. I'm sorry. I'm not all for fighting but it's not a bad idea. Just has to be marketed right.
After two weeks with my supreme gloss I have to say its the best gloss I’ve ever purchased
When’s a yellow palette released?
🙋🏼‍♀️ PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make CANDY JOINT available on it’s own!! 🙋🏼‍♀️💋 I would love to buy it in full size! 😍
biggest money grab yet sadly i use to be excited but jeffree needs a refill for his pocket but i guess you do you just wish jeffree brings something different and not treat his makeup like disneys system from bringing old shit and reusing it but hey just my opinion
You can tell Nicole is not doing his makeup anymore! This is the first time I see his face crack! What is going on????
The foundation he’s wearing isn’t doing him any favours.
i need pink/ golds/ peach/ bronze/ idea
I want the vault I love red lipsticks
The red is looking real sexy
Can u bring back the blue sweat jeffre collection fashion😭
Anyone else notice how jeffree is starting to age a bit his skin not what it used to be
Im a lil younger in teens so i can't wear anything bold so I like the nuteral colors but I wish I could wear these
bubblegum is my favvv x
Love it.  Yasss LOVE LOVE LOVE the mini
So where’s your best friend, j the hater? Thought he was cancelled by you and now you’re joking about him being fired. I used to follow the trend thinking this dude was just misjudged, but he is disgusting inside.
I love it!! Sooooo mini alien??? ♥
🎶I'm your biggest fan I'll follow you until you love me Papa-paparazzi Baby, there's no other superstar You know that I'll be Your papa-paparazzi Promise I'll be kind But I won't stop until that boy is mine Baby, you'll be famous Chase you down until you love me Papa-paparazzi🎶 - The song of Kim Dracula 😍 - A song for you 🙈

This collection is SO good, hit differently. I’d love to have anything from it ❤️
I love that ring & the vault
I love it!!! The 26th is my sons 8th birthday.....can mommy have a gift too? Lol
Jeffree made a Cavity Palette because he recently had cavities from eating jawbreakers.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates⭕️
Literally no one wanted jeffrees face on the pallette ever 🙃
Based on Jeffree’s continued success I’d say the cure for cancel culture is to just be a boss bitch.
I love the colour of your lipstick
Oh no...your cheeks...
Just stunning 💛
Jeffree Stars loses atleast 100k subscribers when he posts a video.
Cant wait to try this highlighter. I love jefferys highlighters
Not this shitty ass “drop another product because there’s drama surrounding me” pallet 😂 baby ain’t getting any views and not selling anymore. Bahhhhh bye
I sold most of my palettes along with 95% of my Jeffree palettes to pay bills last year. 😩😩😩😩 broke my heart as a collector.
Why is everyone ignoring what he did
next time make a house tour or maybe show some cars.
Would die for a pink pallet from you
Omg i need it
I hate when they put their face on their pallets 😭
what the fuck wen he will b canceled
Jeffree’s styling ❤️🥰😘 I cannot wait! I got birthday money and I am waiting for the Vault of lippies!! I need em soooo bad ❤️
I seee redddd redddd ohhh reddddddd
Omg pls do a heat changing color mirror💜🤭 that would be sooo sick!! If it was matte and every time you touch it the color changed from the heat from your hand!!! That’d be so fucking dope
You should send a care package to nurses my whole fam is in medical field fighting the covid for everyone. Or raise money for the hero’s:)
I'm a dental assistant, future dentist and I need this. 🦷😍🤣
Can we please get free shipping!
I am on the fence about buying anything from Jeffree Star anymore. It’s seems he likes the drama too much . Especially since that hair by J is still doing his hair after all of that drama. Jeffree get back to being more creative with your makeup and cut the drama out of your life!
I'm so disappointed with the packaging. Only the Cavity palette cover looks good but otherwise it's just lazy and unoriginal. I'm sorry Jeffree, please give us back the unique fun packaging and stop puting your pics on it...
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
I will stop being a fan if you can not stop using hair by jay. What he did is beyond trashy. I cant believe you would continue to employ a person like that. Someone else can do your hair. Why you acting like no one else can?
Will you do full sizes of the new 16 shades?
Febuary 26th is my birthday!! Looks like the universe is looking upon  me 🥺
I love the white packaging for blood sugar 😍
💘
Didn't he give james charles shit about his relaunch lmao #hypocrite
I do 💚 the blush/highlight  palette 🎨. So pretty!
My bank account bout to be real mad.
I WANT RED STRAWS!!
waiting for an orange-brownish pallete over here
I am a Dentist, and I want this palette!!!!!
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤 wowwwww soooo pretty!!!💕💕💕💕💕🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍💄💋❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I already have blood sugar this is just a rehashed pallette. Its a no from me
Think he forgot the beauty filter bc he looks crusty in this
Misery is so close to Unicorn  blood
Whatever happened to the mascara or was that a fever dream I had
As soon as he opened the mini miss wisdom popped right out *I* *STAN*
Is it just me or does it look like some of the lip colors are the same as already/pre-existing lip colors only named differently? Are my eyes playing tricks?
Why did he put 8 shades from blood sugar in the mini palette and then launch another blood sugar palette in new packaging? 👁👄👁
J going all natural! No nails, lips look like no filler
Why don’t you make a lip liner vault to go with the lipsticks?
To everyone talking shit in the comments “ he just changed the packaging to make a quick buck”, remember that time James Charles tried to say he released a new pallet and it was just a mini version of his big one? Yea thought so, shut the fuck up! At least he’s saying it’s not a new product,  it’s a limited edition!
I miss Jeffrey smoking weed in his videos, laughing and just being chaotic 😉
Literally, the first time I see Jeffree without long nails. He's stunning in every way. Love him. ♥️♥️
This just seems so dumb! You didn’t create anything new to repackaged it
So I'm going to need "candy joint" in a full sized liquid lip asap, thank you! 🍬💋
I want a gold, I know you'll knock it out of the park!!!
OK BUT THIS IS ITTTTT ITS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!
As a developer I’m pretty satisfied with the new website
I can’t wait for the release, I’m gonna spoil myself and order it on my birthday
Will foundation ever be made?🥺🍭💜
Hot pants aint ever been the same since Diego died
10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. If we aren't supposed to eat animals, why are they made with meat? 2. No one is listening until you make a mistake. 3. Give me ambiguity or give me something else. 4. We have enough youth. How about a fountain of "Smart"? 5. He who laughs last thinks slowest. 6. Campers: Nature's way of feeding mosquitoes. 7. Always remember that you are unique; just like everyone else. 8. Consciousness: That annoying time between naps. 9. There are three kinds of people: Those who can count and those who can't. 10. Why is "abbreviation" such a long word?  Editorial: Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.
Anyone else fuming that the mini has 8 existing shades and only 1 new shade?? 🙄🙄🙄
Of course in COVID-19 time it’s common sense to have short nails.
Take all my money 💸💸💸
So few views for this video in comparison to his other launches? 😞😞😞
The jogger set looks like you had your period all over it! 😬
What is happening with his cheeks?
You can tell he deletes comments💀 squeaky clean
The hair ❤️😛🍒 I wish red shadows looked better me... Sigh. & FYI Jeffree, that nude vault was the first JSC product I bought and I still use it EVERY DAMN DAY
Honestly I gotta say it. I’m not into the packaging with him on it. It feels tacky to me.
Your channel is now boring it not have much fun...you just endorse your product as we can see people in America or in EUROPE can only have access to buy this product.. not we in asia so i am unsubscribing u bye
I’m obsessed with EVERYTHING 😍😍
IMO... this was an opportunity for him to recreate one of his most iconic launches and instead we get the same palette just in different packaging. I agree the palette is one of a kind but I don’t want a second one I don’t give a dam if the new packaging is wrapped in gold! And I’m not sure what’s going on with the makeup look in this video but it put about 15 years in age on him. I wanted to be wowed and ready to give my wallet when he announced the highlight palette but I was like 😩 very underwhelmed. Time to reinvent JS.
Omg this is so gorgeous
Yes!! Love ❤️ it!
Omg 😁😁😁😁
Can we PLEASE get a cool tones collection???? 🥺🥺🥺
JEFFREE WE NEED A PINK PALLET (hot pinks baby pinks every pink) 😁😁😁😁
Snoop Dogg could never
How many goddamm pallets does one have to make in a year?
I was here first to check if the brows made it... Jeffreee....... :(. lol.  but also to see the new launch :)  i was getting into those eyebrows tho ive been growing mine out too!!!
$52 is a legit steal compared to a palette I saw online for $245!!!  Also, Jeffree went from meh packaging to "I'm rich bitch" packaging!!  ***Calendar reminder set to go off  **11:55** CST - CHECK!!***
I love everything I’m obsessed ❤️❤️❤️
Something soft... an Easter pallette!!!??? Get it Jeffree Lynn🔥🔥🔥
Love the smaller palettes  BLOOD SUGAR  MINI !!!!  YAY!!!!!
You forgot to swatch OUCH!!
ba ding!
Strategy wise, I think this was a bad launch having your face all over products. People may like the brand, but may not be fans of you individually. There should be separation and having your face plastered on actual products makes it unbearable to escape your presence. No hate but facts are facts.
I'm only watching and likeing the video to upset the people that want to cancel him.
Maybe I'm the only one, but I want a mini blood lust palette!😈💜💜
The New Vault!!😍❤️🤩❤️ OMG!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💄💋💄💋💄💋💄
I would love to see a nail polish
Please release bite my tongue and misery in full size 🥺
Love the deep dark red lips 🥰
That packaging is so ugly and cheap looking compared to his usual stuff
Purple and pink pallete
Why are you and Jay working together again? You never keep your word. Horrible
Blood sugar was my first ever non drugstore makeup too. I saved up and loved it so much, still use it. Its sad bc i dont support his actions in life but its hard to let go its like a relationship. It was my first love! Im scared to waste $ on brands i dont know will be good vs buying his knowing it will be amazing quality. Quality and packaging everything is great :/
It nice that you went full Poland with the mirror colors
when will you launch your skincare??
Honestly the vault lip is amazing... NO ONE makes stuff like this, love him or hate hes original and one of a kind.
Can you address why you lied about firing haribyjay? It’s really disappointing.
Anyone else mad he didn’t swatch “Ouch” LOL
So beautiful, makeup is on point Jeffree. Love the candyfloss, reminds me of Easter time.  BTW, it's lockdown in the UK, nobody has nails at the moment 🦋 Favourite is blood sugar mini, want everything though
Why is no one saying anything about him skipping the top right color?
Omg the jogger
Beautiful. ❤️🦷💋
PLEASE DO MORE RANDOM ITEMS LIKE PHONE CASES AND STRAWS AND WIRELESS CHARGERS. ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Scandalous.. but lord is he a good business man 👌
It's a no for me
Damn the views are real low 😬
Did anyone else see that he forgot to swatch one of the colors. I'm sure it was by accident, but I am surprised that nobody said anything to him. 🤔
The red Latex Suit & blonde wig is giving me Britney vibes. Anyone?
I don't want to be mean but what's next? The Butt Rash collection? Why cavity lolll
jefreeeee you are so funny
okay but "COMA" is that gurrrrrrrrl !!!!!!!!
Anyone else think Jeffree sounds so genuine in this video?
I HATE that there's faces on it/ people and I have an entire wall filled with your photo cards in frames. That's my opinion. It's just cheap looking to me.
Ok but why would u release a mini and not do like a compliment palette with new shades because people that have the original palette don’t need the mini if it’s literally the same shades.
Imagine still supporting this guy
Omg yes a pink pallet!
I am just in love with this bloody color !!!! Love this pallette so so much just like how much I love you !!!
"Jeffree where are the nails?" this made me laugh so hard, cause that's exactly what I was thinking. Anyway, as always smart business moves. Truly Inspiring. Lots of love. Keep slaying
Jeffrey when are you going to drop a fragrance?!?
Why does he have Kurt Cobain's chubby cousins face on his chest?
I’m so ready for a mascara
I love the candy frost me oh my that pink is beautiful
are shane and jeffree still friends?
How dare you leave out central standard time and having me Google what time it drops😂
I need all of those pink shades and the three darker shades...
How are people still supporting jeffree...
flop
I’m in love 🥰
It's really wonderful!! Congrats!!
I don't care about other people's opinions about you or what you have done...Your make-up IS ON POINT! I am really looking forward to your new highlighters. They look BLINDING😜
Heeey baabee......is any black palate will be launched ever😁🖤
Oh my godness , jeniffree star was so hot because is was red ❤️🌹❤️🍓🍎🍒🌶️🍬♨️⛽🛑🚨🎈
I wish the frost pallet matched the packaging. Once he took it out I was like, 😔.
Oh.  My.  God.  I’m dying😵 I WANT THEM ALL😍😍😍
ngl, the past few launches have been underwhelming 😔
Your skin looks so dry😩 guess from your skin care products you’re working on??
Wow all I see is rubies lol 😂 love ❤️ it though
I died with your red blood wig and your stunning makeup Jefree , 100% beautiful.❤
Love it !!! Can’t wait to get it all.. but I felt the video was a little dry. Where’s the tea?! The anecdotes the insight into “Jeffree” we always get with the videos :/
Your community needs a yellow - Golden palette !!!!!!
I think he’s running out of ideas
Holy fuck that first red
Im so sad , i love your makeup , but really the same palette only with withe packing?  You hace everything to create blood sugar volumen 2 !!!!  With new colors !!! No one have your creativity !!!!
Can we start a petition for a pink pallete😩✋🏼
Is it me or does Jeffree’s voice sound different?
Todos hermosos 😻
Beautiful ❤️
I LOVE Jeffree but I'M REALLY disappointed with the mini blood sugar. I feel like people will be paying $28 for ONE color cuz we already have the other 8 colors.
I love the lipstick she's wear
If he just did a vault with all the red tones in it - I’d snap it up so fast!  I feel the other colours would be so wasted on me!!  Shame!!
Literally 99% of people ignore this message: “God save you and your family from all sickness 🙏❤️
"I'm totally sure that the person who stopped to read this comment will be very successful in everything he does" 💛
❤❤❤❤❤
We all know she can’t sell her produces anymore 😂😂😂
Personally I was disappointed to hear it had 8 shades from Blood Sugar. It’s a great pallet but I was hoping for some new colors.
Gorgeous line up!! As always! THRILLED about the red and pink vault!! Would you ever consider doing a “build your own” mini bundle or vault!? “Treat yourself”!
I LOVEEEEEE
Jeffree... Please tell me you're gonna do some of the new VLL in full size....
his skin looks bad in this video😬
I feel like some of those lip shades are the same :/
was that how long the eyebrows lasted? xD
I want it all 😭 Also, we need a blush palette PLEASE?
Blood Sugar is still one of my favorite pallets. I just hit pan on some of the shades. ❤
I love the whole collection
This dudes still around(
By putting yourself on the packaging you’re turning away everyone who doesn’t support you but likes your makeup. I find that hilarious
Tbh Jeffree goes above and beyond for his business. From the quality, packaging, photography
Jeffree please come up with new ideas I love ur products but I really feel like ur running out. Let’s get some Orange, Pink, Some metallics some metallic lipsticks!!! Something!!!! WOW US AGAIN!!!!
Jeffree, I’m gonna need some of those new lip shades released as full sized individuals! Please?! I NEED bite my tongue and misery! Absolutely Beautiful!
Jeffrees team: how much red do u want? Jeffree: yes
No shade on the moves being made... but how is he a MUA when he’s never really done makeup on anyone... besides himself.. shouldn’t he just be labeled like a markup creator? Or something idk
Hi jefffree
I wish you could buy them in Sweden!
I actually love your natural nails Jeffree!!
I’m sad to say I’m bored of Jeffree’s new collections 🥱
I want to know what foundation this is because it looks awful in the smile lines, etc, also im a little disappointed as i love jsc eye palettes and get so excited for new releases and i will get that mini palette but i did not need a new blood sugar, will have to hope the summer release will bring a new palette xx
Well I had a house fire and lost all my Jeffree Star makeup, so this will be the first I buy again. 💜
Cherry soda 🤤
Your products are just epic, love how much they can be subtle or in your face!  Love your videos!!
@jeffreestar It is so weird to see you without nails.
Jeffree never disappoints!❤❤❤❤😍
Really want to get the blood sugar palette!! (Jawbreaker is next on my list to get first though haha) but this little baby is STUNNING!! Yes!! Do ppl just click on the video only to hit the "dislike" button? Really shows ppl's maturity 🤷‍♀️ if ya don't like it, don't watch it smh
I need those mini liquid lips in regular size
I was convinced I wouldn’t want any of this collection until I watched 🙃
I would hit the pan on that middle shade INSTANTLY
can we talk about how QUICK THE WEBSITE IS???? omg
Jeffrees skin sooks a lil rough in this vid. 😅😬
I’m actually excited for this launch!! 🥰
I love everything about this collection! This is a must need!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Wow he still has fans? Wack
I am really liking the icing iv its very beautiful, don't get me wrong they're all beautiful, but the icing iv is my favorite. Candy joint is my favorite lippy.
nah I love jeffrey. I can see his passion in his work. and I respect it.
Red is my absolute favorite color, but I literally cannot afford any of this right now as I'm only getting 1-2 days a week at my job due to covid TvT and they haven't given me my w2 yet either  I can't wait to see what everyone else does with my favorite color though, I'll be over here with the blood lust palette I got with my taxes last year ;-;
Is the mini limited edition?
Girl 3 years and still unavailable 😑
Only swatched 8 he missed the top far right one
Thats it, I'm done, stop it Jeffree 😭
I would DIE if you made a mini Blue Blood palette
Wtf is the world coming too🤮
You look cakey today
Also, ntbm red might not be the forgiving color js should wear. Kinda aged him
I absolutely love the color you are wearing!  What is it?  Did you say and I missed it somehow?  I need it in my life.
I have a hard time believing ppl were telling you to put yourself in your pallets but ok  🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻 everything does look very beautiful
Plop goes the WIG 😱😬
Sir....idk if people are into it as they used to be..
Ms. eyebrows said buh bye
Take a shot every time Jeffree says 'Of Course'
candy joint
I wear prick, cherry soda and coma almost EVERY FUCKING DAY!! I can't wait to get my hands on these new products! What's a girl gotta do to get on your PR list babe❤️❤️❤️
Thank you so much for launching this on my birthday! I feel so honored to celebrate my 30th with something so awesome 😉😉 jk jk! Can’t wait to see what else you have in store for us this year!
whats the mini retail for
That ring though 🔥
Am I the only one who hates when influencers/palette creators put themselves on the palette? I think it’s tacky.
Aesthetic is different like his other launch video, not here for the editing. Only 8 swatches and he seems off. But whatever who cares getting that mini palette on initial launch, HOPEFULLY! VCR (no crickets here!)
well done perfectly.♥️♥️👏
https://youtu.be/9PH9cAL-FHY  Iwakura, who has made a fool of a martial artist, has been in a fight. Quarrel match
https://youtu.be/LL9kESaTPNM
Can't wait 😘😘 always love love everything !!!
💉♥️ rate and 💉♥️ beat are 🔥 ! Hair-flip💁🏻‍♀️
I don’t think I’ve ever saw you not wearing nails.
I want the alien pallet back 😭 I never got a chance to purchase it !! Please jeffree bring it back for a limited time 🖤 also ILYSM 🤍 and I definitely will be buying this whole collection I can’t wait 😁
Hi Jeffrey! I am a type 1 diabetic and am wondering if you would consider donating a percentage of the proceeds for this anniversary collection to a diabetes research foundation. Since the collection is related to blood sugar, it seems very fitting. Just a suggestion. Beautiful collection!
when I saw the blood sugar palette in real life- I was like- yes WANT
Looove my Blood Sugar palette still!
Wish there were more reds/pinks in the mini honestly, I'm so tired of neutrals. But the new lip colors look gorgeous, wish they were individual!
Blood Sugar🩸is my favorite palette and the mini is so well done with the best shades for creating a neutral look or 💥 full out look! I’m a healthcare worker and have to wear an N95 mask all day and I love to do a vibrant fun eye to cheer people up because that’s all they see of my face.
yas
I love it.. thanks
Normally I think Jeffree's make up game is on point but in this vid there is hella creasing around his lips
the colors are so preettttyyyyyy~
2021 jeffree wearing synthetic hair. how humble. maybe he really did fire hair by jay
Hair extensions/wigs by Jeffree Star, I'd buy that. 😘
Watching this knowing I can’t even put on  eyeliner 😅😅😅
I wish you didn't use so much red in your theme for the set...it dullens how bright the presentation of the colors is. A mint background and jacket would have been perfect. That aside, the palette is amazing!
I NEED to know what lipstick/lipgloss is on your lips. It’s gorgeous. 💄
I'm in love with all the reddddd
Oh my, Jeffrey in red is  looking fire
I don't wear makeup > just mascara. I want to buy them all, but I don't have money for that and also I wouldn't use is... so 😔😪. But I love you Jeffre 😍
I’m glad you’re back on YouTube. Hopefully you’ll be back for regular uploads. We’ve missed you Jeffree. Your look today is fire 🔥 miss thing!!!
I have 2 blood sugar Paletts and i schow this video and Need More
What’s a VCR though? Seriously asking
Omg a blood sugar mini
I think I neeeeed the skin frost palette 😭
I want a nature green/brown palette.
I’m kinda disappointed.... I have this palate so it’s kinda a eeehhhh for me...
Jefree Star ❤️
Sorry my phone spelled your name different Jeffree 🌺💕💋💋💋💋💋💋💋 💖 ya
What about the bundles?
Jeffrey you only swatched eight out of the nine in the mini palette you forgot the chestnut brown in the corner 😯💕
Ugh.
bangs dont look good on him. 😩
I dont know who filmed this or what is different but I love the filming on this video
I don't think I've ever seen Jeffrey without nails!!
Ya know, Jeffree... There's so much more you could do right now, to help others. And look, I know you worked to get where you are...I know you worked hard for it, and I don't mean to sound as if I'm saying you don't deserve it. I am, however, saying that you should put it to **good use** and help the very people you're trying to sell yet another pallet to. We're not just broke out here, we're **broken**. So, congrats on the 2 year anniversary of Blood Sugar... But let's take some time to acknowledge the fact that most of our country is suffering in some form or fashion (if not multiple all pulled together😓) right now and they need help, and hell ... Maybe even sending them a free pallet right now would at least lift their spirits. Just my humble opinion, without throwing out all the hate and cruelty that I know people are thinking rn. And sorry... But they are.
Ppp?
Did anyone else go on his website and notice that he’s got the conspiracy stuff for sale half off
His eyebrows are gone again!!!
Omg 😍
I love the white trunk ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You need to make blush pallets!! But love this collection will definitely be buying🥰❤️🥰❤️🥰
This is the lipstick collection I’ve been waiting on!!!!
Jeffree's eyeshadow formulas are the best I've ever encountered. Period.  Now let's see a pink pallette, babyyyy 😍
I'm more into singles shadows, I hope that you wril do that one day, we all have favorite shades that get jused up before others.. 😀
Girl I want the colors of the liquid lipsticks PINK HOUSE & FORBIDDEN FRUIT as part of the permanent collection VERY QUICKLY PLEASE THANK YOU !👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Will the new shades be available in full size individuals ??
Cheap shit literally Ali Express makeup
So he only came up with one new color and is reselling the old colors in a smaller package. Yeah I’m not spending $28 just to get one color. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ don’t get me wrong they are beautiful but I’ll stick with my bigger blood sugar
Love him or hate him, he sells quality products
Jeffree should create a foundation already, as his foundation is so cakey in this vid for some reason
Ur my unapologetic pleasure, girl!
😭 i'm in envy, I don't have any if Jeff's makeups.. only 2 frosts 😭😭😭😭😭 you guys there are lucky!!
Easy on the filler to the cheeks! This must have been recent too, it looks like the filler hasn’t settled yet.
I love how we just keep reusing shades 🤣
BiiiiiiiiiiitttttttttttCCCCCHHH ❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️ YOUR WIG❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️😍😱🤯❤️
Jeffree!! How did you know Blood Sugar was my favorite? I should have just signed over my refund to you. My original palette looks like crap but I call her my baby too. Most people love the looks I can up with using her but some tell me it's too much red. I don't care. I wear it for me and I never get enough red. It's my favorite color. I going to buy the whole collection plus another mini and hopefully the sweat suit.
the amount of flies I would have caught by how long my mouth was gaped open due to the complete beauty that is the shade wisdom! Blown away
We need a yellow, orange and pink pallets. Come on Jeffree make it happen.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
The mini and highlighter palettes are a NEEEEED
Should make it so we can get the sweats separated and not as a set....
😷
I love the lipsticks but not all of them would look good on me. Could you please make them apart of the jeffree star line?  Please and thank you.
The 20th is my birthday!! Aww this was my birthday gift in 2018. This year hasn’t been good to me at all so this birthday is eh but this mini is cute! Congrats girl!
Why is he unstoppable?
He did good reducing the volume of his lips - they are now so natural and amazing. Good job Jeffree.
In LOVE with the outfit, makeup and wig
Omg I love it all and if it is all available on beautybay then I will be buying xx
hello PIGMENT!!!!
*hi*
I e become obsessedddd with Jeffree’s sweatsuits they’re so comfy and fit perfect
i love your nails, compare before, sorry but im just being honest, 🥰
Jeffre launch a lot these days
I saw cavity and had flashbacks, I’m forced to sue
These palettes are useless unless you wanna look crazy everyday.
$28 dollars?! OUCH. Too much pink too for this dark goth.
SUPER❤💋❤
Anyone else feeling mugged off cause there’s no single lipsticks. Jeffree, ya girls too poor to buy that vault 😭😭😭
Love the homage to the front line workers with the red heartbeat on the mini ❤
❤️❤️❤️
Please for the love of God, release the new 16 shades of Liquid Velour Lipsticks individually, Jeffree. My Mom and I will have a battle 👏🏼to👏🏼the👏🏼death over so many of the red shades. And a mini ain't enough. Please, please PLEASE release them (at a later date, of course. No rush. You have done so for the nude collection.) Individually. Please say you will. 🙏🏼
No shame how expensive it is
Jeffree when are u gonna make a pregnancy video too
The moment he swatch the red..... Ohhh so pretty
Jeffrey...when will you make us a purple palette?
Love you can't wait until February 26th getting the gloss and blush
Кто русский?
this red women style so cute you ar stunning
Jeff here looks like hed call me a slur
Candy joint, pink house and sugar spike.....and heart rate. And the highlighter palette is calling me!
😐 anyone else disappointed?
The clothes merch looks like full of oils spots. I don’t like it
Fuck the nails! You are STILL gorgeous!! So loveable! Love the mini blood sugar. AND even though I already have the big palette. Yes. I will be getting the mini too. x
I love the highlighter palette.
I heard you got robbed on the news
Jeffree: makes new collections and reviews makeup James: *is bald and pregnant and grooming minors*
No lip scrubs? :(
blood sugar "Wisdom" of course, darling.
Why da  Hell i am watching this?
Oh I need that vault it is a gorgeous colour story
JOHN 3:16
God bless you jeff
With peace and love i will not be making a purchase.
Fuck you
I love u jeffree! Keep up this bad bitch shit!
his excitement during his reveals makes me so happy ((:
SOOOO IS EVERYONE OK WHITH HIM NOW IDK ..????
Omg marry me please 🙏💜
When will you be doing an updated house tour Jeffree? 💜
What about Anna Nicole? Is it no longer available? It would have been a great addition to the Lipstick Vault
This reveal 😍😍 I’m excited for everything
Imagine if the vaults you make open like a real vault if possible to make😩😩😩
3.51 for all the Dutch people: HALLO!
Thank you Jeffree for an amazing collection and great video! No matter how big he gets I still feel like we're just talking among friends in all his reveal videos. Yeah, he missed a swatch on the mini and I suppose there's some texture on his foundation (you should see what I look like writing this) but guys why don't we keep the comment section positive? I'm just grateful and happy to watch.
Hey guys I’m rich
Hey Jaffree love from India y don’t name ur pallet from diamonds name or ur dogs name
“This is a small collection”....GIRL. Compared to other beauty gurus, this is HUUUGE!❤️
I LOVE everything! Looks STUNNING! I just WISH Jeffree would make more you know EXTRA clothes he always wears cus honestly I'm not really a hoodie person,imagine Jefree star CROP-TOPS?! SOOO ICONIC!
No one noticed he swatched 8 colors and him just not swatches that one color makes my perfectionist kick in and get a little annoyed
I NEED A LILAC/PINK PALETTE FROM JEFFREE STAR 💜💗
Troughout the video i was hoping that the wisdom shade was going to be sold as a single but i guess i’m gonna have to get the mini and depot it :(
I’m the underwhelmed button 🥱⬇️👎
Jeffree makes the most STUNNING looking palettes! I'm always soo SHOOK whenever he comes up with new collections and the shooting of the campaign is always SICKENING!
Jeffree I know you’re ridiculously rich, and can afford to upload in 4K, can u pls film and upload in 4K pls tqvm.
Honestly I feel like most times having peoples photos on the makeup packaging really ruins the aesthetic. It looks kinda tacky. I really loved the elegant palettes from the past. I wish we would go back to that. Fun textures, colors, designs, looking like a jewelry box. The packaging was a big reason why I got some of the JSC products.
Yessss
People who just watch and don't buy the pallette  Raise your Hand 🤰
Can you do a tutorial of your eye look with this palette
crickets ha ha !
Am I the only one wishing he made the new red metallic eyeshadow in a single? I do not need repeat palette; even if it's a mini.
It is outrages that children watch this man.
he needs to make robes
Last think I expected but I AM READY 💖
I'm not feeling the mini blood sugar. It's too many shades of red too similar to eachother. I wanted the purple and pink in the mini. They're the shades I wanted the blood sugar for. Am I the only one who's underwhelmed?
Is it just me or is he the Willy Wonka of the beauty industry? 😅😂
I complete collecting all of his releases. But, the blood sugar mini palette and highlights with your face jeff? i have a doubt if i will purchase it. Old packaging was much better. But, the vault and limited edition, sure i'll buy.   In his mirror i miss the metalic like lettering. The clothing brand is fire. Again, jeff don't put your faces to the palettes, maybe you can put it outside the box.   Love you always. Matteo xx ❤
Heartbeat is everything the new ruby woo
Omg i really cant stop thinking about Cavity!😍😍
Please do the bright red lipsticks as singles ♥️🙏🏼
If you genuinely watch this you need psychiatric help.
It's definitely cheeck fillers
How do you have no bread
If I had the platform he does, I wouldn’t take advantage of it so poorly. He knows he is going to sell cause his name is on the product. As a makeup artist myself, if I wanted to celebrate an anniversary of a huge success, knowing how many of my fans already have the original product, I would have innovated it. Maybe turn the mattes to glitters/shimmers or the shimmers to creamy mattes. I would have made it have a new “wow factor” that lacks in this launch. Maybe I would have introduced a new texture/formula to blow the followers away. It’s underwhelming and I can’t see spending money on this collection when I already have the first. Just shows how much room in the beauty industry we have to evolve/regardless of money.
The mirror is in the kolor of the flag of poland
Cool, 3 out of 9 swatches from the mini are barely visible. Nice!
Already 3 years from the launch?!? Sis they felt like 6 monts
I dnt even have the blood sugar original palette n here i am wanting the mini one 😭 why do i have to live so so far where everything is costly af
Jeffree star without the claw rhinestone nails?!? 🤯 that’s an unusual sight I don’t know how to feel about it 😀
Love that 💍 it’s gorgeous !!!!
He looks like a 70 year old posh grandma who cakes on her makeup...
did you swatch "ouch"? or was I just not paying attention.
When I ask to copy the homework and they say “yeah, just change it a bit”
🙄when he actually just launched the EXACT same product in a new package …
I love it all! Sadly I’m poor and can’t buy any of it though. So I just watch and wait for the next funky and fun pallet concept that you may come up with next Jeffree.
I love my blood sugar palette SO much but I wish you would’ve made more new colors in the mini. 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️☹️💕
I need that lipstick vault but my bank account is going to die :)
Clever Devil himself.
you should have just cover the man's face,,lmao
Will you make a little collection of staple red lips with glosses and matt liquid lips?♥️
Is it just me or he did not swatch the top right shade on the blood sugar mini? Would’ve love to see it :( ❤️
Hiiiii
And then some dumb spoiled first world kids who's parents never disciplined would byy this shit!
Girl or boy?
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Pink House and Forbidden Fruit liquid lips I LOVE !! Congrats on the collection WOOO YAYYYYY
Ur lipstick is Soo baaaaaddddddd!!!
Damnnn jeffreestars views have dropped significantly 😅
Cardi B!!!
Why is he still a thing
Congrats I love you!!
Jeffrey your not living for sure
Love it!!! Will the new VLL be available in full size soon?
Okay, will be ordering!  Now for something else: I want Violette_FR and Jeffree Star do each others make up, make it happen!!! Like if you want this too, it will be sooooo EPIC!!!
Lol, Polish mirror
Omg girl i see what you did with saying revamped😘👌
not him losing subscribers weekly 😲
OKAY!! thank you very much everything is 100% amazing but give us BUBBLEGUM and CAVITY in full size!!!!!!!!!!
Why I'm watching all this reveal videos? I haven't got any 🙄
Uffff 🥰🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥🔥
Foundation looks bad tho. Whatsup? Not because of your skincare line i hope? 😱
I’m so picky about reds and I would wear like 4 of those wow they’re all so gorgeous
✨👑 QUEEN 👑 ✨
Kanye watching this: 😫🥴
I may have to use Jeffrey star packaging and campaigns as a case study for university at some point because they are just so insane and well-thought out
So we are not going to talk about the fact he missed to swatch the third shade?
Would love mascara and nail polish in your most iconic colors 😍
ugh jefrey makes fun of real people that has cavities 😭😤✨🖐🏻🖕🏻😔😛😁💕
Iron man
So pretty ⚡️❤️ with those natural nails
Jeffree looks like me on my period 😂
Everyone in the uk when Jefferee revealed the shade name as frozen prick 😑😯
OMG! I love the nude vault and will be getting this lip vault
Pretty lipsticks-maybe could you add lipsticks colors on brown and black skin? This way the skin shade can be weighted against own?
Who needs 8 super similar shades of red 😂. No thank you! 🤨
Living for the blood sugar remix!
There's Polish flag on the mirror :D
Those views seem to really be slipping away compared to where Jeffree was just a year ago...
I feel like this channel is more about promoting than anything else. No v logs in a long time...... just bought a new place I wanna see more. So impatient.
like a song 🎧 ⚡️
https://staygoldencosmetics.com/  ......i wanna see if the glitter lip kits are jeffree star approved from this site or jeffrees own version of it id rather do jeffrees version atleast it would be vegan love that everything's vegan
❤❤❤❤❤
Gorgeous palette 😍 im still waiting on a jeffree star foundation 🙄😍
Can you do a collection about Mars because the robot landed there i duno eheh 😅🤣✌️
Jeffree, one improvement I can think of to make to some of your products would be to have the mirror stay automatically open without the customer always having to hold it so the mirror doesn’t fall down ❤️🤍❤️🤍❤️
Um can you send me the used swatch pallets and lips pls I actually bought the blood sugar pallet when it was on sale my first one. Then I started buying more on sale ones. I can’t afford that reg amount. Maybe someday I will well not me. when my hubby makes an E-7 soon to pay our bills aka my bills hehe love you xo 😘
So we should spend 28$ for one new shade? Huh.
His ring literally called me poor in every language-
*eyebrows have left the chat
Cancel jeff
I’m gonna buy the vault, but I know already that I’m gonna need a single full size version of Bite My Tongue & Misery. 😍😍
Jeffree is all worried about his nails when all we can see is that huge ass ring!
Jesus is the  only way  to the Father God and is our true salvation. He died on the cross  for our sins and was resurrected on the third day.  Confess and repent and turn to Jesus in sincerity of heart.  Read and follow His Word alone. Ask the Lord to humble and teach you. The time draws near.  For those who have ears to hear and hearts that are still tender to His calling.
No one is buying your crap any more

When I got Blood sugar in the Halloween mystery box it had no protective cover on z mirror or on z palette, but all good.
i have the same inhaler lol
Isn't it VHS? LOL. ❤
I love  all the different wigs you wear when you do a product reveal❤️
Don't do this to me, I'm broke 😭😭😭
loveeeeeeeee
As that girl from Lizzie McGuire would say; Jeffree Star you outfit repeater!!  *the palette*
OH WOW
It will be released on my birthday !!!!! I used the blood sugar pallet today 😍
How did I get here
Me when I’m on my period but don’t want to wear a tampon or pad lmfao
This is just depressing every video drops in views by the hundreds of thousands. He needs to get off youtube now while he still can save face
I’ve never seen Jeffrey so cakey/wrinkly
The concealer isn’t coming up as free after you spend 40$😅 but this is a cool launch the lipstick vault is what I’m most excited for ((: hopefully those new shades become full size ?!
JUST GIVE US COMPLEXION ALREADY
I wish I could buy the new Liquid Lipstick shades individually instead of the whole vault. 😕
A yellow palette please
Ohhhh girl, those liquid lipstick. I love reds and dark mauves 😍😍😍😍😍 fall all year baby
Why is he back
I love that mini
I Hate You
This is a remake of something that existed before. Pretty lazy
I hate you
That mini is speaking my name
YESSSS♡♡♡
I’m so confused
lmao
Me: I cant even buy just one of your lipsticks
Where are the singles and NEED more blue 🌊🌊
Good gawd, Jeff looking his age
U need to do more highlight pallets like the first one !!!
Dang back then his reveal videos would get a lot more views, now well....
Omfg 😍❤️
My favorite pallet colors by far.. Loving this collection!
So I’ve done makeup before nor have I really wore makeup until a few days ago. I bought the conspiracy palette and noticed, red looks really good on me haha. Got a lot of compliments for my first try. Check it out on my IG tj_king love this new palette colors too. Think I’ll get it and try it out.
Omg star is red!!! I love it!
Not impressed
No teeth related palettes. Do something neutral thats well balanced . Nothing related to teeth blood or sex. You are missing an entire demo. Only girls 13 to maybe 25 are going to be interested in buying the collections.  Compact and classy with a great range from light to dark NEUTRAL TO COOL shades. Diferent finishes. Back off on toppers
We need to see more not so flashy and not so clunky packaging. Please try a neutral leaning cool 18pan. Not only mattes. Please think ND glam . We want real shimmers and not toppers. You'd be reaching a whole new demographic. Im 43 and only palette I own is orgy and orgy mini. Lots of shades are close in color.  No crazy ass colors . We just want a good range of lights to darks with a few different finishes. We don't need a dramatic collection name
I legit can’t handle every time the second camera is on him he’s staring at the other one. The makeup is always bomb - now let’s fix this camera work lol
Wow launches the day after my birthday.
I hope the reds will be released as full size asap! Love the reds!!
I hope jeffree does more mystery boxes soon😍
The products seem great but the price is a bit high😕
I NEED Candyass. It’s my color.
The view count bahahaha nobody gives fuck
I see your eyebrows lasted.. Still look stunning though
his launching is getting less and less attention, usually get 1M+ after 12 hours and always on top 3 trending, now only 600k and cant even get to top 10
I am waiting for the palette with some crazy multichromes. Cmon, indie brands flooded us with these but we need J Star ones with nice packaging 😍
Did he not swatch Ouch???? I only counted 8 swatches....maybe I'm wrong....
I love it all babe but you never mentioned the bundles 😪
The dark lip stick was my favorite the chocolate Burgundy beautiful 🤎❤️
🤮🤮🤮
It’s a VHS not a VCR lol
im not a fan of jeffree on the packaging 🤫 i feel like it makes it look cheap
What the ewwwwww if you are trying to look like a girl get a tip
Did Jeffree get new teeth? Somethings weird with his mouth..
Why is your customer service garbage? I bought 4 palettes and two of them came in horrible condition, pans not in their slots, eyeshadow globs everywhere, sticky fingerprints and scratches everywhere and they said one wasn't damaged at all so they'd do nothing about it. I will never buy from you again. Like, you can pretend all you want that you take care of issues, but I had someone's actual DNA in my palette and y'all said "oh well, not my problem". Disgusting.
Omg live for it! Love the new colors especially Heartbeat and Sucker Punch! And the new sweat outfit I am going to get that for sure! Just love everything!
The mini palette for the win so far! I feel that the Cavity palette is a bit expensive for only 4 shades
I swear Jeffree star is the “queen” in creating good make up pallets.  Starting with the packaging, colors in the pallets, lips, highlighters, etc.
There is something wrong with his face, specifically his lips
ITS RED hahahaha !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
♥️♥️♥️♥️😍😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
😱😱😱😱😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This dude is wack
I knew he did that review video last week to justify putting up his own product video without getting called out 😂😂 admire the hustle tho👍
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Will a foundation ever be released tho
Ew
i want the highlighter pallete!!!!!!!!
In the nicest way possible... Jeffree speaks like a “villain”, almost reminds me  of Jim Carrey in Series of Unfortunate Events, or Johnny Depp in Willy Wonka... god I need better words to explain it 😂
Did he only swatch 8 out of 9 shades?
Omg I love this and cherry soda shade
Love it 🩸🤍
I also need to throw a jogger set in that cart! It's mine and my  brother's Bday on the launch day FEB 26 BAYBEH So it's a sign! A sign to SPOIL MYSELF ON THE BIG 35!
I liked the cavity packaging but you literally used old campaign photo on it and also it doesn't have the name cavity in it
The lip swatches only feature white people… um sir where’s the inclusivity???
I'm so proud of you ❤️❤️ i hope to see you always happy and successful ❤️❤️
Darn you look gorgeous with these shades of red and pink
Omg THE LIQUID MINI VAULT!!!! ITS IMPERATIVE THAT I HAVE THAT IN MY LIFE RIGHT AWAY🤯 Btw love how JstaR rushed through the price drop🤣❤️😂  you're beauty line has consistently been iconic. Keep SLAYIN JstaR! U are my all time MUST HAVE make up! Not a single item has ever been anything less than greatness. #FuCkThEhAtErS #SlaytheJstarWay
Hey
I’m a Jeffree Star addict, I love everything you put out🖤🖤🖤🙌🏻 I’m a huge fan!!!!! Love you 😍
Yes queen !! Maybe make some lip plumpers next 👀
So gonna get the mini just for the new shade even though I have the original lol and anyone else noticed his eyebrow moment has now died looool
yall I love me some JeffreeStar no doubt but I don't if its the cameras good quality or the foundation or maybe the video was shot late in the day but it doesn't look good when the camera zooms in (Jeffree still pulls it off though). Other than that I'm about to order me another hoody/jacket
Sort of  wish my birthday was in February , when orgy came out my boyfriend bought me the nude vault. I don’t wear  nude colors as much but it was a thoughtful gift he gave me, but now that I saw that red vault I’m sad😂 I think ima buy👀
Can we get more colours of the teddy hoodies please! Like red, blue, yellow, green, purple....
HE DOESNT HAVE NAILS ON 😧😧😧
I love it so amazing can’t wait to see it in my house with me and my daughters using the new make up .I love Jeffree star new collection it’s amazing but are we surprise he always comes out with amazing stuff .I just hope I have the money by then cross my fingers😍🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🙌🏼♥️❤️😘
I am deeply unsettled by the nails. Who the hell is this person ?
Gorgeous! Gorgeous! Gorgeous!
Can we get a BRONZE PALLET FOR THE DARK GIRLS
I want to know when you will make larger sizes. All clothing never has 2xl or 3xl. Shane’s line does, but yours doesn’t. Not cool.
The mini blood sugar palette is a perfect palette for Indian bridal makeup
That Wisdom shade is EVERYTHING!! Your cavity palette looks amazing too!
This would have been the perfect time to bring back Rich Blood. I've never found a red lipstick I loved as much as that one.
That "new" red in the mini looks very similar to the metallic red in the oG.
His Suscribers are decreasing👀👀 anyways I love Blood sugar 👌👌👌
That WIG THOUGH!!!! 💥🔥💯🔥💥
I wish this was application swatch video
Js you missed the upper right shade  lol
A launch on my 21st birthday!!! Yes ma’am😍😍
Omg, that hoodie is an absolute need
Omg 27th February is my birthday... Thanks @Jeffree star for such a great launch... Obsessed...Can wait to hv it all...
Wish the background was gold. Too much red! 🤣 Ignore meeeeee
Girl you need to make candy joint a permanent color! I don’t wear that much pink or reds and that one is one I’d definitely wear! 😩
WANT
Love this collection but hate the packaging. Love you booboo but I don't want you on the actual packaging.  Much prefer your other pallete designs
I’m going to need Candy Joint as a full size ASAP, thanks! 😍😍😍
The reds lipsticks are BOMB and misery is literally ruling my heart !! ❤️
Love it.  My favorite color is RED.
Why didn't jeffree swatch ouch??
Very Nice! Good job Jeffery!
Your lighting when you did it in your old reveals was softer. It’s to bright now, when you swatch we can not see the colors so well because the light glare.
I NEED it all!! This entire collection is everything!! Whatta perfect video to end my night with!
Does the outfit come in plus sizes?
Nothing new.  Nothing to see here.
Omg come on . This is so YAWNNN. I was expecting a pink pallete. Cavity? Really ? I can’t help but to feel everything is a cash grab like I’m so uninterested
A new pastel rainbow palette please? :)
Just as im getting a tooth extraction and bone graft for implant ($4k, hello los angeles, kashiiiiing, I wish I could use the klapaucius cheat code)
Jeffree #queen 👑 😘
Your cheek gloss looks like that numbing medicine they put on before getting injections.
Its all about making money during a pandemic...smh 3 year anniversary?! Wtf not 5 or 10 but 3..? & alot of those lip shades looked the same just as he is One to point that out it other companies 😂😂
Love the white trunk!
How u and Kanye doin?
If you can’t use all the shades I bet they make good shadows too
You should make some shoes and then using for a new product they might look good I might get them
He really playing it easy frfr
Bring JSC to India😭😭
Love the mirror 😍
🥳
06:58......uhhh......?
Dislike highlighter pallet... pic pkg. and colors. Bummed. 😭
a lot of swelling going on there
Jeffree is down ANOTHER 100k followers?? WTF? I LIVE for JS and his cosmetics!! xoxo
OBVIOUSLY we now need a look using all of your favorite shades you’ve ever created
Don’t get me wrong I’m a huge fan of jeffree but I feel like he’s been so uninspired lately. His releases are becoming really predictable and I looove the quality of this stuff so I wish there was something fresh and new to buy. The whole monochromatic this is getting a little dull especially doing to same color again. Same packaging style. Same themes. Even similar promotions. I just want Jeffree to get back to being innovative 😪
We actually need sale to afford these products :")
Omg im obsessed 😍 😫 ❤❤
Your nails be looking fresh, Ms. Jeffree. Love it. Letting them take their breather ✌🏼
Dislike this lipstick on this video🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️
You should definitely sell some single shadows
Can you buy any of the new liquid lip shades individually or only in the vault?
I love that tye dye hoodie. I have Blood Sugar but the mini is lovely!
Bomb color!!
The half millisecond unexpectedly pretend because throat curiously hang after a obsequious bottle. calculating, small probation
Wish I could afford to get my cavities fixed 😩
Umm Jeffree Star NAIL POLISH?!?! Please🥺
I hate her like hell
Your collection is so nice! I bought a name necklace from MyOwnNecklace.com last month. Perfect!
Heal me Lord and I will be healed, save me Lord and I will be saved, for you are my praise, Jeremiah 17:14  Offering  HOPE  🙏 Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved.

Bye your canceled
WE NEED PINKS 💕
I'm sorry but I hate when people put themselves on palettes.
Yo One cheek is bigger than the other. Silicone? You Don't Need It!!
Shutup illuminati puppet
I'm glad jeffree and I have an understanding about messing up my pallette I got from him, cause the greys in cremated, I love for
Omgoodness it gave me a toothache!! Love it!!!
I just watch these videos to admire the packaging since I am a graphic designer.
Red looks great on you!
I love so many I love. But I love Misery, Heartbeat, Cherry Soda and Firestarter ❤❤❤❤
Candy joint is pink and weed had a baby
It launches on my birthday 🥳
I love the hair
❤💓💗💖💝
Makeup giving me annabelle doll vibes
It’s really hard for me to use Prick because it’s literally hard in the pan I barely get any pigment un like the other shades in the palette. Does anyone else have that issue
Hey, Jeffree. I love the blood sugar palette and my two favorite out of the many favorites is "Bite My Tongue" and "Misery".
yes im about to go in debt to buy this
Blood sugar mini = HARD FAIL!! Why the fuck 8 of the SAME SHADES??? Omg you could have hit this out the ball park but smh huge strike instead. I’m super mad you didn’t even try on something that would have been so amazing for us that support you.
I can see the highlighter pallet at a tj maxx in the future (est. 6-7 months)
OMG 😱 palette ❤️❤️❤️❤️she is sooooo beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️ 최고에요!!!!!! 역시 👍🏼
Always red
God what happened to this world
Qim Qardashyanin I love you
The mini is beautiful but the heartbeat graphic is bugging me, it's not medically accurate. A quick Google search would have fixed it 😖
Jeffree Star Lashes....????
I had a dream the other night that you were a tattoo artist and I had to throw you a party. It was sick lol.
PLEASE make these lipsticks into singles! These are all so gorgeous 😍
Jeffree Star could be the new Billy Mays. He's so animated and a good talker never misses a beat.
No mystery boxes :(
Are those eyebrows MIA again?
will the new lipstick colors be sold separately? i need forbidden fruit! i can't afford the vault
If you see this cause your rlly big can you pls pin me 🥺
What you're watching is passion. Genuine, real passion. 👏👏👏
❤❤❤
more red? 🙄
I know many people said it already, but I hope if enough people ask he will make one. PLEASE DO A ALL PINK TONED PALETTE.
Me: never bought or known how much the vault things were “oh they look about 80-90 dollars for a few of his liquid lipstick shades  Him: “now- they’re 160 dollars  Me: “ 🥲 what ☺️
See now THIS is what I've been waiting for!!! This is Iconic Jeffree!!! Can't WAIT!!!  That mini palette is everything!!! 😍😍😍
I love the highlighter palette😍 but I wish the package designs were flipped😟 I’m tempted to get the mini for the new shade and glucose as a backup 👀
God bless you and Jesus loves you! Have a blessed day!😁
since a lot of people are asking for individual liquid lips what jeffree should do is allow a customer to create thier own customer mini liquid lip collection.  create the packaging make it a minimum of five selections and market it that way as an individualized pallet and set a price point.  you are always going to have people who are going to buy the entire collection but making your own would be great and you would get rid of more product that way especially if some of it is not selling enough
Nice wig sis, who did it?!😂🫖
Dude looks like he has goose eggs above his cheeks.  He get kayne s ballz stuck up there
PINK PALETTE PLS!  YELLOW PALETTE TOO!  GOLDEN PALETTE ALSO!  💗💛🤎
Bite my tongue and misery!!!!!!!  I’m also broke
First time ive ever seen him without nails
Wtf is this thing ? Wow this is what kids watch ......
Drooling over the mini
Misery liquid lip is STUNNING! Ugh! I need that in my life!
This video has a back to basics feeling
i bought blood sugar for my boss.  i showed it to her months ago and she forgot about it.  i got it for her birthday.  i did not know she was looking for new eye shadow.  she loves it.  she loves the quailty of it.  she can put it on and it is on her eye lids alllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll day.  it does not come off.  it does not crease.  it does not wrinkle.  she wont wear anything else now.  she is amazed at how this quality is so far above anything else on the market.  she tends toward the nudes to match more of her skin tone but i told her to experiment with more than one or two colors and blend it in throw a pop of color on there.  thank you jeffree for giving my boss some joy in her life every day in this crazy world we are in right now.
Ugh. I'm bored.
I’m not really a red person but I love the mini
Stunning!!!!
I’m probably the lone person that’s loving Jeffree with his natural nails.
Thanks so much for putting out a palette of the most used popular shades and not a new pallet.That’s you giving refills instead of making it a new thing to buy and I hear you woman!
Wow!!! The 💄 so many sexy yummy reds!!! 👛👠💄 Jeffree Star ur fuckin killing it baby!!! I love all the reds! 💄💯💄
Karma karma, his skin is looking alittle rough
We want a BLOOD HONEY! 🍯   Yellow tones with some oranges and browns!!
I have the same inhaler. Now I feel like I need all the JS things so I can match the inhaler too! ❤️
So yall really putting that orange "skin frost" on your face? 😑 and the colors in the vault literally like every other 3 looked like the same colors.
I hope one day a DRAMATIC Smokey eye pallets is released. Something to add a jefferee twist
You skipped over the brown shade!
I’m so upset that Jeffree haven’t done a PINK FANTASY PALLETE!!  With baby pinks, hot pinks, metallic or glitter pinks with some peach tones!   I’ll definitely buy it!
я подумала что Это Егор Андрюшин
At about 18:55, I thought you were gonna say "she's here, and she's ~absolutely~ really, really QUEER." Which, lemme just emphasize, I can still hear in my head, in your voice. You are gorgeous through and through and I hope to meet you one day! Muah 💋
Jeffree... launch day is my birthday!!! Wanna send me a birthday present?
It looks the same 🤷🏻‍♂️
You can just tell he’s cut the budget for the packaging... a very mediocre brand now
OMGGG THAT VAULT IS TO DIEEEE FOR. love the new highlight palette and it's so different seeing the blood sugar in a white palette! So cool! I laughed out loud when he hit his inhaler 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 so fuckn EXTRA. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!! 💘💗♥💓😍😍😍😍😍😍
Don’t care if people keep on unsubscribing him, still love him though.
So excited for the new reds in the vault!
Such beautiful makeup...a work of art❤
I was hoping for a 🧡 or 💛 eyeshadow palette since you've done every other color in the 🌈
Congratulations 🎊🎉🍾🎈
Y’all he said that he was testing his own skin care in his last video. That’s why his face looks different.
Neon collection pleaseeeeeeeeeee🟢🟢🟩🟩
When will y’all stop making this clown famous
Woahhh.. the views have realllly started going down .. haven't they? I remember his old video hitting a million in a few hours
Yes please come out with a pink mauve purple palette
Where is tongue pop. It is my favorite   I hit pan very fast.
Feel like I’m goin blind with this whole red setup
Jeffree is ✨working✨ the whole outfit!especially the wig. Stunning Queen.
Wondered why he all of a sudden posted a video the other day reviewing stuff. He knew he had to before this video because people were giving him a hard time about only posting to sell things.
I want all of these new shades in single full sizes.
I can’t believe that was three years ago lol feels like just a few months ago
"It's like Ruby Slippers for your eyelids"  LOVE!
That new shade reminds me of Jessica Rabbit 🐰🤩
I love it all! Just kinda sad I can’t afford it yet. But, one day.
Woooow hermosas paletas ❤️❤️ los labiales los quiero todos ❤️❤️
He didn’t have long nails. What is this! Jeffrey Starr explain! This is a crime! No flashy nails! What?! It’s like seeing a UF... it’s like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs. 💅🏻😱😵😷
Idk if its the foundation settling or jeffree actually has wrinkles? There's no way Lol
not shure if the beauty filter is off or ur mua did a bad work on ur skin. fire him/her
I was super excited for the mini until I realized it only has 1 new shade. Hoping he does a single shade for Wisdom like he did with Put It Back 🙏🏼
i am so happy for you  you desrve it
Cavity? Really?........
I love everything.  I hate that it doesn’t come with Jeffree Star himself to give us pointers on how to do it like he can.
Jeffee: ..." grab a red bull and let's get started...."  Me: IM GRABBING MY KNEEES ! IM SHOOK 😯
Jeffery is the willy wonka of makeup
Who the hell said "jeffree we need you on the palate."? Pretty sure no one
Does he have wrinkles?
I want a liquid of medieval kiss and perfect red.
God I love your laugh!!
Pink Glass palette?? You should name it that wow i can already see the sparkle
That Blood Sugar Mini Liquid Lipstick Vault 💜💚💛🧡.
u skipped over ouch...
I don't wanna sound mean, but what's up with your face!?
hi jefree can you just talk real about all the drama i don't know what to belive now   what is true and what fake
I saw the thumbnail after chugging a 2 liter bottle of DrPepper. Now I’m sure to get cavities.
I love the candy joint lip color and the mini palette.
Gorl you’re gonna need to work on the shipping cost and offer free shipping at least $50 no way everyone is able to spend $125+ to spend at a time for free shipping. You can afford it!!
😱 BITCH nooooooo I got $5,000 in my MAKEUP savings account let's go!!!!  😲! Yes we needed blood sugar mini oh by the way in the restored or renewed mini orgy palette some of the colors really didn't need to be changed and then some of the colors that weren't working on the first mini orgy palette are really high and impact in color so thanks
I will love a jeffree cover 😷
You should do a galaxy palette with violets, teals, indigo and some duo/multi chromes. I think it could be incredible!
🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸
Keep going strong!
Everything is cool I love the mini and the highlighters
Hello I love this collection I wish I’m in you PR list awwww 😉🐶🐶 piénsalo 😇
I love ruby
I am floored to see this jefree starcosmetics honey complete loading quickly
I even want the inhalor
All I see is Coach Baker’s wife
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You are always on point but the color and wig is making you look old
Waiiiitttt pause im going to roll now
I am bored
Hold da fuck up I was listening to itty bitty piggy and seen red yassssssss
I need the whole collection because I love makeup and also because I am a dentist and this represents me ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🦷🦷🦷🦷🦷💉💉💉💉💉🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸
all of my cheeks  how many does he have
Him and his narcissistic ass putting his face in his palette. When will you stop that 🙄 bring back the old designs without ur face
I need that palette! You have the most perfect makeup brand in the business! I cannot get enough of your products! You put so much thought into everything you do & I love how much you care about your customers!  You’re my absolute favorite! 🤍💕
03:24 ironic... I'm getting my wisdom teeth removed tomorrow 🥲
https://youtu.be/sJeRLFjkaMI
I really don’t like the new packaging with him all over it
Jeffree looks old on this video...
I just need to know if those new shades of liquid lips s are going to be sold individually 😮😮
Oh I wish I got paid before this gets released! I wonder if any of the 16 new velour liquid lip shades or if any of the highlighters will ever be released individually. I saw some AMAZING red liquid lips and all but one color in the highlighter palette that I really want, but even after I'm paid I can't just purchase willy nilly. (I'm on disability for life. :( )
I want a red backpack 💔
OMG Sucker punch liquid lip is the most beautiful shade 😍😍😍😍😍
I like when the design on the palettes is more low key or timeless, it’s a little weird having models on the palettes at all, even if it’s you. I’m going to get the mini palette because I love your products but I’ll probably put a sticker on it or something lol I don’t wanna see anyone’s face while I’m doing mine. Also, the mini vault is breathtaking.
❤Love it all !! I Can't wait too Buy them.. The Color Palettes are too Die for, Everything is Stunningly Beautiful❣...
I really like the versatility of a highlighter blush palette!
Damn, Jeffree Star really dropped off in the last year.   This showed up in my recommendations and I was like, oh yeah Jeffree star!   what happened to him?   No one reviews his stuff anymore.
U missed the top right color
Wisdom looking like a sparkly hot Cheeto
The sudden lip moving gave me a heart attack. 😂
Why does youtube promote this garbage?
Considering how Jeffree is super particular about his skin and his skin care routine.. I’m surprised to see the imperfections. Maybe it’s from testing for his upcoming skincare line...
Meh
The world awaits THE JEFREE STAR COMPLETE FACE PALETTE 🙏🙏🙏
Blood sugar was my first palette ever when it came out and my favorite make up brand of all times
The highllighters!!!
Tell me why I’m crying over this reverse packaging...
Jeffree got some filler in those cheeks!
I’m not loving the packaging on the mini and the highlighter palette 🥲
Beautiful just beautiful ❤️💕
Meh
Waiting for some JS single shadows  so I can have a few of my favorite shades from each palette
I want the mini :0, if only I can afford it
Okay, but I still hope in the Europe visit tour
I love the way Blood Sugar looks in the white packaging!!😍
Why was I expecting a second volume of blood sugar 🩸💉🤦🏻‍♀️ like its cutee the collection but Hmmmmm 😬🤥
Hi how are you
Can he put out an eyeliner already! I want it to be able to last during me sleeping 😂 mascara maybe? Lol
🥰🥰🥰
Could you not have split screened the lip swatches on a light and dark skin toned person?
🔥❤️❤️❤️
I am so excited
not the white edition
Obsessed
Hi
he may be problematic sometimes but his makeup is amazing
Why do we need a mibi pallete with the exact same shades we already own?
JEfffREEEE I LOVE YOU BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING
Omg- those minis are everything!!!! I have NO idea why it took me so long to purchase your products, I’ve been watching you for years. This last month, I tried your lip scrubs, concealer and a liquid lipstick. Um.. wtf. I turned around and purchased 8 more! I haven’t tried any of your other products but I’ll get there! My 10-year-old and I love playing with all the products and look forward to trying all the others!
Hard to believe there are no negative comments.... interesting
I’m loving that candy joint 😍
I just want to tell you that you are so beautiful and I love your videos. I only have a couple of your palettes but they are awesome!
Since Hair-by-jay-1 did Jeffree's wig for the E.L.F Review, do u think He did THIS HAIR🩸💉.??!?  Ya knw, cuz Jeffree "holds the ppl around him accountable & only good vibes only."       🤔🤔🤔 Just asking & wondering 🤷‍♀️
Just wondering, are these eyeshadows going to have GARBAGE payoff like the mini orgy???
Even though some people don’t like Jeffrey you got to admit he does have great makeup
Jeffree I would kill for this collection!!! I just hope it’s still available availble when I can afford it
OMG HIS LAST PALETTE SHOULD BE CALLED JEFREE AND THEN HAVE LIKE HIS FAVORITE SHADES
I wish he would stop putting his photo on the products. It ruins the consistency and aesthetic of the original palettes and makes them look tacky...
I used the palette without realizing it was the anniversary today. I actually just got it recently, but it was on my list of things I needed in my makeup collection for YEARS.
Keep your nails “natural “ you have the hands for them this way. 😎

That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!
What the hell is even that
Honestly, Jefree worth our money way more than kylie
ANOTHER PALETTE WOWWWW
For someone who doesn’t use a whole pallet- a mini is amazing. I can’t wait.
But can we get the red liquid lipstick that becomes sparkly when you put your lips together again 😰
Why his views getting less and less....
What the hell
i feel like a shade name should be "redbull"
Is anyone else finding the reds in the lipstick vault to be a little too similar or is it just me? I mean, I can see the difference between them, but I would prefer more of a variety of colours or just a smaller vault instead of paying for like six almost identical colours.
i love how with every drop he changes his profile picture. he's amazing.
As a type one diabetic I love the name of this palette 🤣 really hits home ❤️ much love xoxo 💋 would be cool for a collaboration with this palette and JDRF to support juvenile diabetes. That would be awesome 👏🏼
I want that wig!!!
Love ❤️ this I want it all I would of liked the new shade in a single like the put it back
Cant wait can we see gold in the future to please like yellows gold and oranges need a moment
Omg it so weird that he doesn’t have his nails done because I always love his nails and you look beautiful 🤩 I love the red
Hi do u ship in south east asia? Singapore or malaysia
It'll be last day until next year. TC JSC 2-21-21
We need foundation. Like ASAP 🤷🏼‍♀️
Me: I want the mini and the blood lust pallets.   My husband: That is super expensive cant you get something like this for cheap?  Also me: nope Husband: ugh ok Me not giving a F.
I’m hooked on a filling. 🦷⚙️🪥🏥❤️💉 can’t wait for the cavity mini palette and highlighter
Will we ever get a completely pastel pallette? 🥺👉🏻👈🏻
In the thumbnail your giving me very much corset realness. Until I realized it's your legs 😆❣️❣️
ugh I honestly love his makeup and this palette but I refuse to give this man money :(
I remember buying the Blood Sugar palette when I was at my Nana’s house. She was so confused as to why I was so stressed on launch day but then understood when she saw how beautiful it was. She died a few weeks later. so this palette makes me think of her. Can’t wait to get something from the relaunch 💕💕 editing now that I’ve watched the whole thing to say that my nana died on the 26th and the fact that this is launching that day is making me cry in the club
Repackaged stufffff mmmmmmmmm NO
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXEirlno8LYNjlQqxoLLqkA
LOVE Jeffree and everything he does although I do think the vaults are a bit of a scam. He puts in exclusive colours so that if you are a collector the only chance you have is to buy it. But most of us already own at least some existing shades. I just think its a bit crappy. I miss when he released individual liquid lips. $200 on lipsticks is just crazy
He never swatched "ouch" in the upper right
Love it
I’m bored!!!!!!! A missssssssed opportunity!!!! Bitch you literally just showed the same product Lmfaooooo I can’t!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The  lipstick colors are so pretty.  I wish you could buy them individually.
Forgot to swatch "Ouch" in the mini pallet?
And you’re gonna tell me there’s no red or white  tooth 🦷 mirror !!!!! Or a tooth 🦷 pallet ‼️‼️
Yay! Love it!
Wait, did he miss a shade when he was swatching the mini palette???
I am a single mother of 5 and I love make up. I was super excited when I finally got me some Jeffree Lynn make-up! Got it for Xmas. I love it.. waiting for Xmas again to get more lol!
I wish the lipsticks were full size. I’m not a fan of the minis
I never using make up or anything but i would buy that trunk pallet just to collect it ❤️
We need single shadows! ❤️
Waiting for a yellow or pink pallet 😍😍😍
who the hell has money for eyeshadow
I am excited for this one again ❤️
Girl your face is starting to melt ... bad filler?
I love the Candy joint color. I can’t wait until JSC makes eyeshadow singles. I’m a natural redhead, so many colors I can’t pull off. I’d love to be able to pick the ones I can wear and make my own custom palette.
quick thought: imagine a build your own palette collection called "custom" same trunk style as blood sugar, but in black and white with the word custom on it or yours truly or my eyes only on it, and you could select 18 shades out of the current inventory, retailing for $60, with $4 add ons if you wanted to replace a eyeshadow pan with a highlight pan.... Jeffree if you're reading this, make our dreams come true
Is she a boy
Awesome girl 💞💞
Orange 🧡 palette plz
I miss Jeffrey’s nails.. they were epic
I wish he would have release the new shade in a single. I don't want to buy the whole palette for one color.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I just watched this and for some reason I HAD TO BUY your orgy pallet!!! That’s the only one I knew I would end up using most of the colors!! I’m SO EXCITED to get it in!!!!!
Honestly, Do women really wear all these different shades of makeup. Why don't I ever see this on other people. I'm not saying it's not cool, it is, but where are people wearing this makeup???
I like wify
I knew something was weird about Jeffree today. HIS NAILS!!!!!
Congrats Jefree! It has been so fun watching u grow to the beautiful makeup guru! ❤️
also I love the design of your new site, but the graphics keep crashing my internet browser, just want you to know that that may make things very difficult come launch day
I just got my wisdom teeth out yesterday and then you post this 🤣🥰
JEFFREEEEE WHY CANT YOU EVER BRING THOSE MINI VLL IN FULL SIZE 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 theyre too good to be discontinued 😞😞😞😞😞
quick question Jeffree, I know you're super busy and doing all sorts of amazing things at JSC but when will we see your foundation? I remember this tweet (The highly anticipated Jeffree Star Cosmetics first ever foundation formula will be launching in 2020. 9:28 AM - 10 Aug 2019) like it was yesterday and I really just wonder if this is something we can look forward to. Much love ❥
I’m in love! As always ❤️
❤️ 🦷❤️
I want candy joint nooooooooowwwwwww!
Did he just say “as a contour and highlight in one” 🤨
I hope the new shade is sold as a single. As well as the new lipsticks in a full size. I need EVERY LIP in a full size
Why is it when I decide to purchase something he comes out a week later with something new. Godammn! Those highlighters and that white Blood Sugar palette 😩😩😩
Omg I love candy joint color well it be sold by itself plz plz say yes i was your snap chat love the lip liner you are working on I can't wait
Omg I've been patiently waiting for a red/pink vault and boom 💥 🤯 on my freaking birthday the collection comes out! I'm shook! I absolutely love,love,love the lipsticks and the vaults! I live for a good nude and I'm dying to get my hands on the red vault! Just a collection that I can't live without!!! You absolutely made my birthday amazing already! Thank you so so so much! Oh and the white blood lust anniversary edition of the pallete 🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍💋🌹💗👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 you kilt it once again you beautiful bitch!!!
I noticed him swatching from another palette before showing the mini palette & the swatch 🧐🤔
makeup > bad person
Omg REDRUM liquid lip!!!!
Unicorn's Blood is a favorite of mine! btw, I always get head over heels excited when Jeffree Star talks about new palettes and palette additions..like AAAHHH!!!
TODAY IS THE DAY OF SALVATION   If I die today will I go to Heaven? Why would anyone put off the most important decision they could ever make in their lives, concerning eternal life?   "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of god—not by works, so that none can boast." EPHESIANS 2:8-9   Moreover, Brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, and that he was buried, and the he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.   1 CORINTHIANS 15:1-4   The ABC's of Salvation:   A: ADMIT THAT YOU'RE A SINNER. This is where that godly sorrow leads to genuine repentance for sinning against the righteous god and there is a change of heart, we change our mind and God changes our hearts and regenerates us from the inside out.   B: BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED, AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD. Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ died for your sins, was buried, and that God raised Jesus from the dead. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was.   C: CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. Every single person who ever lived since Adam will bend their knee and confess with their mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings.
Jeffree just keeps pumping out palette after palette.. this one seems like it’s in bad taste  🥁
I am in love with the packaging!!!!
Who is here with redbull😎
JEFFREE HEAR US OUT!  Single eyeshadows please!
JeffreeStar summer 2018 energy is back!!!
Can you make a 420 pallette?
I'm SO happy to see you getting back to your normal makeup videos. I know you didn't see my GRWM video where i kind of went on a rant about liking you, but i literally wished for this lol. Can't wait to start collecting <3 <3
Yes, we NEEDD A PINK PALETTE!! 😭😭😭
King
how is that little sheet of plastic supposed to prevent shadows from breaking?
Did Kim K steal your pink latex for her lingerie line photos???
I just realized that Red is the new black ❣️❤️❤️❤️
Don’t order his makeup!!!!!
Did he say $38 for the highlighter palette?!?! Well I *WAS* gonna get it
Girl did u shave them brows off again???? I was so looking forward to what he would look like with slayed natural brows 😩
I love this palette, got it during quarantine and excellent investment for those red moments! However, an all white palette, is my dream, alternate a dark first color, straight ghost mode!
I love the vaults!! They’re a great option for someone like me who can’t decide on just one shade 😄😄
I noticed he missed ouch but all is well
Those lipsticks 😍❤️ Will be having them ❤️ Jeffree, you did good 😍🥰
Bring back Alien!
Miss. Blood Sugar if ya nasty!
One day I will buy a JSC palette 😩❤️✨
Jeffree’s eyeshadows are literally *SO* pigmented tho!!!!   Edit: btw thank you guys so much for the likes I’ve never gotten this many before 🥰
You forgot to swatch one shade from the mini palette
Hey you are releasing it on my 40th birthday!
🥲 not another red pallet
Candy joint is literally the perfect shade ove been looking for to a similar lipstick i found in high school! Will it be its own full sized one dau?
It's so strange to see him without his beautiful acrylics on. Glad to see he's going natural, it's just as beautiful. 😊❤
A yellow/ orange palette would be super cool. 💛
When miss star comes for our tax refund
@jeffreestar I actually love the no nails moment
I have moderate asthma and every time you take a puff on your inhaler it makes me laugh cause I feel you. XD Love your videos!
PERIODT. WE LOVE RED ❤️❤️❤️❤️
That Cavity Highlighting Palette looks AMAZING!!!!! <3
A pinky mauve palette pleeeeaase 💕 spring is coming . Give us some cute, girly flower vibes 🌸
Take a shot every time He says “of course” 😂 *alcohol poisoning just from him talking about the cavity palette alone” 😂😂   ✨it’s all love I know he was just excited✨
Make up?   Something is quite different!
if i buy all shades will it come in that fancy box?
I just want glucose as an individual please! ❤️
HIS WIG LOOKS LIKE CHEAP ROBLOX HAIRS PLSS
He can't really do a "all pink" pallet, at least I say he wouldn't, that's Trixie Mattels signature color for her cosmetics line. Honor among thieves ya know
How do you always look beautiful in all the colors! 🥰
We gonna talk about how many times he said beautiful XD <3
I love all the liquid lipstick colors...
The white is so classy I LOVE it!!!
You look beautiful Jeffree ❤
I need the mini for wisdom so I can wear it with the Controversy green for Christmas 🤣🤣🤣....is it too early for Christmas? Lol
Hating the fact that he released all these new colors in an expensive ass vault. There's only 4 or so colors I'd like to try and the track suit, just like almost everything else hes come up with lately besides blood money, I'm just unenthusiased.
i'm broke & i cannot wait for everyone to continue to support him on this new launch
VHS not VCR LMAO!! and I'm younger than u dammit
That foundation was not it sis😔 Jeffery star DOSE NOT have those age lines around his mouth. That foundation makes him look 50 years older😡
Yes please put your gorgeous self on your palletes!!!!❤️
I would DIE for a pallet of *browns* including more RUSTIC shades of *red*
Damn what a horrible name for a palette hahaha
I appreciate how majority of his products are WOC friendly. The first blood sugar palette is one of my go-to palettes. I might have to get the highlighter blush palette.
Dhane Sawson.
Does the blood sugar come with the new shade you were wearing because I am in love with it lol
Shot every time Jeffree says "so pretty"
I’m obsessed with a prick too. I call him my boyfriend 🤣😩
I need that lip stick vault! Taxes need to hit hahahahaha
The lip colors are so beautiful
Jeffree plz do a pink palette 💖 & a yellow one 💛
i love u so must and wish i could have some of your things
Will you please rerelease the Bomb pop mirrors that is something I’ve wanted still could not get one last time! 😖❤️
I hate his excessive use of his inhaler, when he doesn’t need it
Love it can’t wait to get it ❤️
I need $160...
Okay but candy joint is a MUST!!!
Beautiful
Hoping there will be a mini Blood Lust palette in the near future.
Wow beautiful white
I get doing exclusive shades for the vault but like, I only want two, and I don’t want to spend $160 for two small lipsticks 😭  If anyone wants to sell me the two darkest shades. . . 😂
Lovin it all.. U always amaze me Diva Queen 👸 be blessed ❤💋❤💋😘😘😘
You get a jeffree star lip vault, and you'll never run out of lipstick <3 I'm always afraid to get so much make up all at once cause it may expire before I can use it all. But I want it<3
I’m digging the lip palette collection.
I love the names Prick and Sucker Punch
Blood Sugar was my very first non-drug store makeup. I legit almost cried when I used it. I am very excited to get the mini... and probably everything as that one taste sparked a very horrible addiction to JSC.
The last 3 you swatched are my FAAAAVORITE!!!! But am I the only one wondering if we can buy single shades from the bloodsugar vault?????
Blood Sugar Vol. 2 and I'm living for it! Ok, *"Bite my tongue"* and *"Misery"* are literally my favourite colours of the Vault *(which should be called "Blood Bank" but anyway. Missed opportunity!).* They are so amazing and I pray that they will come out as liquid lipsticks because I live and breath for them!!!
Not caring for the Cavity Palette, but that's my opinion. Would like to see something new and interesting.
I just got the OG blood sugar palette for Christmas (3 years late cause it was sold out) and it’s the only palette I use now! ❤️
Damn you really felt the need to dig into those shadows hard😕
The highlight pallet isn't it for me. I wish brands would make different higher pallets with there own shades for different skin tones because let's be real. If you're very pale you can't use half of these.
Just on time for Valentine's day ♥️ love it
the white pallete compared to the red one is much better to help distinguish the reds from each other, so that was a good thing for a change :) im loving the mini glosses cause i can never finish a regular size gloss but the minis are amazing when you like to switch it up often :)) good job on this release Jeffree ~xoxo
I thought he said nude vault... I got excited! 🙁
Watching the swatches of the cavity palette I must've got a bad blood sugar from beautylish. Mine is hard pressed and super dry. It's extremely hard to get pigment whether it's a swatch or on your eyes with a brush. I have alien and blood lust as well and they're not like that so i always wondered why blood sugar was everyone's favorite.
Wow that Wisdom color is GORGEOUS
❤️ 🥳 Congratulations!!! 🎊🍾🎉
OMG 😳 LOVE 💕 it ALL! Damn, sure hope I have enough  💴 by the 26th!
Omg 😱 love it
When are you releasing the root canal pallet
Nobody cares. Live and let live. #IlluminatiSlave
Not gonna lie...I want the highlighter/blush set
I love  it when you say BAM
Why do I feel like this is the same stuff he’s already doneeee I want new stuff
I’m wearing blood sugar tonight! ♥️
Those new lip shades 🔥🔥🔥 Bite My Tongue and Misery might be my favorites!!!
Wow, Jeffree, you are amazing. You should open stores in México. Cheers. 😍
Wow love it!  Can’t wait!  Will the lipsticks be sold separately?
ngl, Cavity palette had me sold up until it was pulled out from the unicarton. lol
I have to know what lip he’s wearing
Over it... honestly it’s hard to impress with a palette we’ve seen it all
I am LIVING !😍💖
Hi Jeffree, FYI, I just went to your new website, and the newsletter "sign up" link is not working. When entering my email, then clicking on the pink "sign up" box, nothing happens. Thought you should know there's a glitch on your site.  Also, will you be producing more mini orgy palettes?  Can't wait to get my hands on a few.  Thank you!!!!
I want those lipstick 🥰🥰🥰😢😢😢😢
Love it
I NEED CANDY JOINT BY IT SELF. PLEASE I FELL IN LOVE WITH THAT COLOR. IM NOT A REALLY PINK GARL BUT THAT ONE IS AMAZING.
Seems like this should have been released for Valentine’s -
It’s that ring 💍 for me girl!
That white looked so chalky when he did the swatch lol
I'VE NEVER WANTED A LIP VAULT SO BAD😭😭❤❤Loving the red vibess
I need candy joint in a full lip😳❤️💕
Did anyone else notice that he did not swatch the shade “ouch” in the top right corner or is it just me ? lol my ocd is tripping, I checked the comments but didn’t see anything
What a serve from the thumbnail😍🌶✨
Love the paletts
My first JS palette was Bloodsugar.
Yeah JEFFREE IS BACK YOU ARE THE BOMB YOUR personality is the best, your products are amazing
So I have three really good pallet ideas you might like! Three more to go with your blood collection!
I read Tarot, and hand. I read you hand. You gone to have some one who going to live with you for ever in your last days of life. You going to have an accident very serius, but you going to live. You have meny lovers with out Love. You are very tender. Need a lot of love trully. See you very lonlyness. A lot of mony, but alone. You hand is very intresting. You have a baby, o goin to have it. A cant tell you more. Sorry for mi inglish. Im from Mexico city.
I LOVE THE NEW LOOK FOR THE WEBSITE!!!!!! ITS ASTRONOMICAL💫✨
Usually I die for a new JSC launch but this one just really isn't doing it for me 😕
Conspiracy pallete and everything Shane related is on sale rn
La coleccion de River
Jeffree star skin have a ringcels
First of all, I want it. Second, I love your hair!
Is it just me or did he accidentally miss the 3rd shade from the top row?
I love this wig
Blood sugar was my only palette from u but I love your highlighters
I am so exited for these new palettes!!!!!! But, is it just me or does Jeffree look older without his nails.
Love the new eyeshadow shade but I have blood sugar already. It’s just not worth it. I wish it had different colors.
That red wig is EVERYTHING!!😍😍
No wonder he's been putting out videos lately.... Makes sense now.  Blood Sugar in white packaging... Cash grab. I can't with this dude anymore. I'm so glad I finally saw the light and realized he's a disgusting, vile and manipulative sorry excuse for a human. All you little stans can come for me as hard as you want.... I do hope that someday you all do your research and understand what and who you're supporting.
when r u gunna come out with foundation..face powder...brow products????
Ughhh I really need those new shades of pink and red. 😍😍😍
❤️❤️❤️
YESSS JEFFREE
I want Sugar Spike on its own.
I'm not where's your nails. Where the hell did the eyebrows go. They were just getting grown put.
"Of course plastic protected" . I received the Blood Sugar palette in the October mystery box and it has NO plastic over top of the shadows. They actually had smudge marks and the mirror had finger prints on it. I reached out to his customer service and they said and I quote "Blood Sugar never had  plastic insert" . They refused to replace anything even with photos. Sadly, I've never touched the palette 🤷‍♀️
I love this collection wish that I could afford it. One day I will have as much Star Cosmetics makeup that comes out. Dreams 🧚‍♀️✨🌟💫
Why redo this ?
I feel like jeffrees quality gets better and better
OMG my bank account is going to hate me over this one lol
Wow I’m going to have to buy the lip vault. All those lip colors are 🤩 amazing!!!
Omg I will be putting stains all over that palette lol
Candy joint is so pretty
I would like to see a pink pallet. It would have been perfect for a valentines launch. Maybe next year 🤔🙏🏻💕💖💘💝💓💗💝💓💞💗💖
Are comments being sensored? 😅😅 oh embarassing
Man these advertisements r sure boring lately
Imagine ........ palette idea : Pink Pussy juice 🖐🏽🙏🏼
Your hair isn’t it without HairbyJay. Also your makeup ain’t it either you look older than usual
Uhm did she mean VHS? 1:00 That looks like the actual tape not a vcr which is what plays them. 🤔 Girl was so confident when she said that shit too. Lol.
Yassssss finally a mini blood sugar 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗😍😍😍😍😍😍
Ahhh here at 5 k
Love the palette, but you forgot to swipe "ouch". :)  And d)id you shave your brows???  I loved them!!!  Hope they come back.  :) :) :
This comment is for Jeffree‘s editor;  Bro you need to do B-rolls after jeffree shows the product.. this is supposed to be an intense moment and you failed lol.. Jeffree star is paying you bank man, at least try to care;)
The pigment is amazing! Your makeup never disappoints! I love you!
i hope you're not as terrible as these drama channels try to have us believe. i love your style.
Hmmm, I think he meant VHS packaging, VCR is the actual machine that plays it.
Heart Rate and Heart Beat 💓♥❤💖💕💓♥❤💖💕💓♥
I love everything!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Frozen Prick is going to be fire on deeper skin tones or as a shimmer shadow on the eye.
The cavity palette omg 😍 it’s a mussssst omg
Wow love love love💯❤ Living for the new frosty/highlight kit and real nice size too. #candfloss colour my Favourite. Weldone hun once again its ALL AMAZING💯👌.D.L 😍👍💋😍👌💋💯
Waiting for Jeffree foundation since the concealer was so bomb 😍
His makeup is stunning and Im living for that red wig but sis common, you are not 20 anymore and we are living in HD now so be kinder to your skin and dont cake it that much. It just adds age to the overall look of the skin.
Blood sugar is my most favorite palette. I use it almost daily.
Is it just me or jeffreestar face looks different?
I miss the liquid lips being launched as individuals ... I can’t afford/don’t wanna pay for a vault when I only like two colors :(
I clicked this so fastttt
Love ❤️ it !
WE NEED A PINK PALETTE, MS. JEFFREE LYNN!! HELLO!! I need your makeup!! Your formula is TRULY THE BEST OUT THERE!!!
I’m living for all the red 😍♥️
Im sick of this person having a platform on YouTube
One of my dream palettes that I have never been able to afford and now there's more 😍😩
I wish the mini had tongue pop in it. That was the first shade I hit pan on. But blood sugar is my all time favorite eyeshadow palette and I am excited to get the white one as a collectors item.
He missed a swatch from the mini...my OCD is going OFF right now lol. So pretty tho <3 love this launch.
Purple
That hoodie!!! And the sweatpants! I'm a NURSE. I'm nursiemarcie on almost all social platforms. THAT HOODIE MUST BE MINE!
Omg she launches on my birthday!
I wish more grinders and cannabis related accessories would be released.
No one: Jeffree put yourself on the palletes more.. 😑😏
Okay but make a “Sugar Baby” pallet with baby pinks, hot pinks and with a side of vacation orange.  Very sexy velvet vibe for the pink lovers
Anyone notice him referring to Lip Stick Nick as Nicole? What happened between them?!
It’s a VHS lol
For a red pallete though, there's not a lot of red .. ☹️
jeffree w no nails has me shook
@jeffreestar review Kylies & The grinch collection
I love jeffree but has anybody else noticed that his primer was not working today cracked the house I still love him though and his make up is awesome I’m just confused as to why his skin look like that
Jeffree said.... "scandals?! What scandals....?" 🤣🤣🤣🤣  ..... "here's my next drop bitch *🎤drop * 🤣🤣🤣
The fact Jeffree and I use the same kinda inhalor lmao c'mon asthmaaaa 😂🤣 asthmatic queens
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤jeffree your pallets are friggin amazinggggg
I have been watching for a couple years now. And i FINALLY broke down and bought this pallet tonight...... and a couple liquid lips! Lol cant wait to try these formulas!
Jeffree is the Willy Wonka of makeup 💄
I love al of jeffrees reveal videos but this collection kind of disappointed me. I thought he was coming out with a Cavity Palette, but it’s just the Blood Sugar palette but repackaged. Sorry Jeffree ❤️
I’m always here for new Jeffree ⭐️ cosmetics and clothing!!❣️❤️❣️❤️
But you didn’t even swatch the “ouch” shade 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 that’s the one I wanted to see the most n was most excited for 😢😢😢💔💔
red stain for days!
were you talking to Pearson or the dentist when you said, "Give me a filling" 😏
Not this literally launching on my birthday o mi god haha
Who done his hair? Cos it's sickening 😍😍😍
Please do a pride collection
Omg Misery is calling my name!!!!! I just really need the lip vault!!!!! Eeeeeee!!!! ❤️
Yaasssssss, Queen 🙌❤️💋
Now I wanna do my sims makeup in the sims 4.....
I love u lol ur awesome
OMG those new lip shades!!! I hope you make full size ones, they're amazing colours!!!!!
I love the entire collection!!! This is what Valentine’s Day vibe looks like to me ♥️
Not to be rude, but Blood sugar is super chalky. I wish all the eyeshadow were "creamy" like wisdom. You shouldn't have to dig into the shadow to get color.
Please please, please my eyes are celery green. I need a QUALITY purple, pink, plum, mauve pallette please my pretty boy??? Don't get me wrong, I want all this too! But please, satisfy us green eyed goddesses❣
I would love to see them in full size sometime soon??
jefree: grab a redbull me: THE FRIDGE---,@,@,-@?!(!
Cuando jeffre saque la paleta rosa el mundo se parará 🤣🤣
I love the gun on jeffrees finger
Love the new lip colors
Is it just me or does Jeffree look different???
Love him or Hate him... Let’s face it his make-up is out of this world!
Omg a blood sugar mini!!
Love the wig and the whole lewkkk
Am i the only one that didn’t see a POC lip model? I thought this was already handled with all the drama last year. Love the products just noticed
I wanted the Orgy palette, but was turned off by him on the palette.. Same with Cremated. Nobody said put yourself on the palettes. That's just your vanity shining through. I LOVE those 2 palettes, but won't buy them for that simple detail. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Can I just say I would not be surprised that he will end up opening up his own medical shop.
we not gunna talk bout how he forgot to swatch "ouch" on the mini? i only saw him do 8 shades...
The collection is amazing I love the lipstick specially that mauve color is to die for I want that color right now I’d be looking all over for that certain color I’ve been looking online I was just looking in the drugstore about three hours ago for that kind of color could not find it nowhere and then bam 💥 🔥   Here it is I was wondering if you can buy a few of the shades separate only asking if I can’t I will definitely buy the full lipstick collection I probably won’t use all the colors know maybe I will it’s actually funny because I’m 40 so I don’t we are all them green lipstick or  yellow but these lipsticks I would probably wear all of them they are amazing colors I think this package is your best year for lipstick the new blood sugar palette looks amazing especially with the way you definitely outdid yourself like always I would really love to talk to you about something well if you find it in your heart give me a call bitch
I don’t like anything red I don’t wear red, I don’t own anything red but those pallets pretty awesome. I would wear these color for a day to make my family happy
Seeing all the comments about Jeffree’s texture, like baby everyone has texture, I think it nice to see him more human and make me feel more happy to see that his skin isn’t overexposed or filtered . 👁👄👁
❤ You look sooo gorgeous!
Candy joint 😍😍
JEFFREEE BABBEESSS !! I JUST GOT ENGAGED AND IM OUT HERE SAVING FIR A WEDDING ANY YOU BE RELEASING NEW PRODUCTS 😭😭😭😭 this is a collectors worst nightmare !!
We need a pink palette named BARBIE STAR
Does anyone know if the new shades will be permanent or only part of the collection?
I needed a J star video today I found my favorite person my grandma unresponsive naked laying in her own excrement having siezures probably since Friday morning
Holy shit a vault jeffree can we just get married I know your not my type but I just love you so much
Omg jeffree you have done it again! 💕 thank you so much! After buying your brand I will not buy another brand ❤
I love (as a cosmetic nurse) you’re redoing your lips. You’re a stunning human! Can’t wait to see what you do next with them 😘👌🏽
Okay I’m sold take my money!!!! 💰
I love his clean fingernails. 😍
Omg We use the same inhaler the pro air
I like how u did the pink and red vault but  I wanted to see a red n pink mini #2 .
This is the first time I’ve ever seen him without fake nails what 😂
Collab with kanye on something ! 😅
A mini mirror would be great to
He has no nails on? Wtf!? That threw me I was like who's fuckin hands are those?
That’s my anniversary day. 19 yrs
Gorgeous mini. ❤️🩸💉 I love Cavity too. Omg I love you so much. ❤️🩸💉🩸Omg that vault is incredible. Well done. ❤️💕❤️💕❤️💕❤️
he should do a full neon palate called party disaster with neon lips.
THOSE LIQUID LIPS OMG
Why his teeth look different?
Love jeffree products but these lauches are too close together. We have to have time to enjoy the last launch. 💜💜 its all too fast its scary how much he looks like bella thorne here. Im still trying to save up for the first vault lol
As problematic he is, make up line is so bomb
I love his makeup but for the cavity palette I would have liked to have seen the names named after stuff you see in the dentist such as ; A dark silver called Amalgam A dusty pink called Alginate  An off white called Composite And a striking gold called Crown
I thought his line wasn’t a thing anymore?
I love red so much. I recognize the lip shades are different, but eight of the shades look the same to me.
omg love it!
7 deadly sins is what we need!!
I cnt wait !!!!!!💋💄
I HAVE ALMOST EVERY PALETTE JS CAME OUT WITH....I CANT DO MAKEUP FOR CRAP LOL I BOUGHT THEM BC THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT. REGARDLESS IF U ARE WITH OR AGAINST HIM, HIS CREATIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!
Wow the lipstick color very beautiful  Can’t wait to try them red is my favorite color My name is Mutia I am a make up artist from Syria live in Chicago
Wish you were all inclusive with sizing. 3x 4x 5x sizes. 😭
I dont like people's faces on palettes :(
This may be my fave. ❤️😍
The pallette really does stand out so well against white
Omg No one notice his subscribers😂 16.7 before last week and now it is 16.6 Million already I’m shock
Im in love with the hair look amazing
I absolutely LOVE Jeffree but this video wasn’t the greatest from him I usually get so happy when he shows his new babies but you can see his anxiety was showing, noticed a lot of flaws about him still showing love though
It's not fair that Jeffrey looks amazing in every single freaking color!! 😅😍😍 what a beautiful red!!❤❤❤❤
it’s a vhs tape but yeah
his makeup is beautiful and so professional idc what anybody says
If no one else gonna say it then I am MISERY IS THE PERFECT GOT RED😍😍😍😍
Omfg jeffree the things you do to me you said whats your fav BITCHHHHH they are all my fav a bitch gon be broke broke hunni but yasssssss i am here for it love Love you Muahhhh
Ok I need to get my hands on some of those lipsticks 😍 Gotta look fancy for my zoom meetings lol
OMG, a vampy collection please
me gustó más el diseño de la caja de los iluminadores que la imagen de jeffree, ojalá lo hubiera dejado con ese diseño, pero fuera de eso, Wow, todo está de primera
The white palette looks so much better to make the colors pop.
I'm so fucking excited for those liquid lipsticks ever since I've tried his nothing else can top it even with a mask on on and off all night it stays
I think it's really cool that he doesn't charge more for the special edition palette like other companies
PINK PALETTE PLEASE
Girl you look bomb 💣❤️🖤🤍
That vault is *EVERYTHING*
I want all of it!!!   OMG that vault is so awesome and with the most beautiful reds I have ever seen.
The pants look like period stains! Well jeffree wouldnt even consider this because he doesnt have period
What lipstick shade are you wearing in the vid? Did I miss it?
Welcome back Jeffree
I would die of happiness if I could get one of the palettes signed by you❤️❤️ I’m so excited for this launch! Candy floss is my favorite shade from the blood sugar!
LOL k a $52 palette isn't about "what it looks like" or " how luxurious it looks". It's ABOUT THE QUALITY. The pigmentation, the colors, the  variety. A palette that's basically $60 for a cool looking box doesn't mean shit if the palette itself and eyeshadow is crap...?
This picture.. like Jefree has hips on ANY planet! 😂
Back to back product ! That’s business
Girl, if you're not doing nails... You're not doing Jeffery!
That wig tho. That reds so sexy
Ohmygood.. ilove jeffree 😍😍😍not my ex Jeff ...but jeffreestar🤩🤩🤩😍
His face looks 🎂 like I’ve never seen him before  (thanks for the likes I’m glad I wasn’t the only one that Notice)
Omg a pink palette called Mr Diva?
I'm guessing hair by Jay done thisvwig as well .....smh
All those lips are stunning 🤤😍😍😍😍
I love the palette against the white! It shows the color story off so much more than the red, still love the original though 😉
that new sweatsuit is to die for omgggggg
wow so boring are you going to release one called cancelled lol ?
Oo are the new colors from the vault going to be available individually?!??
Give us a yellow I want honey 🍯 blood or bee blood!!
Is it just me or does the shiny cardboard with his face make it look cheap? I really prefer the matte colors on the truncks.
A  C A V I T Y  pallete?
I love my nude vault! Looks like I'll be getting another new mirror and some other things....Oh, lord have mercy!
Is me or does look the same like other things he already put out
I'm sorry Jeffrey that makeup is just not your colour just my opinion but damn red is so not his thing he looks good literally in every other makeup until I came to this video I'm sorry if that seems shady it ain't
Omg so excited!!!! These colors are GORGEOUS ❤️❤️❤️💉💉💉🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
omg i want it all the vault and the hoodie and swear are 🔥🔥🔥
Love you Jeffree, but seriously 8 repeat shades?
💖💖💖
I would pay $28 for just the new shade in the mini
So proud of Jeffree. Whether you like him personally or not, the fact that he came from nothing and created such a big and beautiful brand and name for himself is something people can't take away from him. And his brand DOES THAT everytime.
loved this release but, Ms.Girl that foundation did you dirty! i’ve never seen your foundation crease! how are you hun? are you alright? 🥺❤️
You all is that's gonna be the next blood palette Pink blood 💓💞💞💕
that lipstick vault is epic and 100% worth that price. 😍
I can't wait for a pink palette JSC style. Omg it'll be the best pink palette ever!
I love u jeffree but as a friend  that foundation ain’t it sis
OMFG imagine how many checks Pearson ab to get skkskskskksksksk
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY jEFFEE
Omg 😳😳😳
In really sad about the mini. I was hoping it would be an accompaniment with new shades. That being said the one new shade is worth the price for it alone.
He's not ageing well 😑
Can the profits from this palette go towards fixing my teeth? Its my biggest insecurity.
Cool!!!!
love the video
r comments being deleted or smtn.. why is he still liked??
I am still waiting on that foundation.
I already have blood sugar... I wish he would’ve done a mini that didn’t have the same shades but added more shades to the blood sugar line! It’s all love but I wouldn’t buy a pallet simply for one new shade when I already have the other 8.
Girl i live for JSC but that mini palette isnt it. Its literally one new shade...
Jeffree! We are patiently waiting for an all pink candy sugar pallette 😍 and the campaign pictures will be so fun!
Would be worth it if there were more than just one new shade
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃
😱😱😱😱😱😱😭😭♥️♥️♥️♥️😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😱😱😱♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Same shit different pictures? Argh makeup is getting boorrriiinnnggggggg
Jeffree definitely makes products for the rich ...
I need it all in my life 😌😌🖤OMG PLZ MAKE THAT MINI AND SWEST SUIT STAPLES!
Please please a PINK pallet!! 🎀💕🌸👸🏻
@jeffreestar WHERE IS THE MISS PINK PALETTE????!!!! ps....u dont have to keep commenting on your nails...no one is lookin until u draw attention to them...we honestly r just here for the makeup🤗 respectfully🙏
Did no one else see that the tooth in the back looks like a giant vagina? 🤣
So but can we get more regular content other than you coming on here trying to sell us unnecessary products in the middle of a pandemic? At least make you own face mask sis! 🙄
The no nails throws me off
Jeff, your energy changed after break up w nath, but common, life goes on
Omg im a dentist so only with the name and the emoji I want all this😍🦷
I wish the minis didn’t dry out so quickly :(
Love this collection 😍 waiting for a yellow collection 💛🌻
I may never get it... but...Ugh. I'm just .... fuck that palette looks NICE..... 🤷🏼‍♀️
Wow you are red hot and to trot baby stunning sugar. Sizzling.
Not a makeup person, but like the colors. I'm an upcycler, and these would be beautiful paints. Is that possible? Make paints from these shades?
I don't have one Jeffrree Star Cosmetics item. I just pray one day I am able to afford them. So, I live vicariously through her videos!!! LOVE THIS COLLECTION! I'M GAGGING!!! Congratulations Jefrree!!! Love you Sister!!!
I’m SOOOOO EXCITED for the highlighter palette!!
Was it just me or did he forget to swatch ‘ouch’ from the mini?
I sat here for 3 mins going “something off. Wtf is off?? SOMETHING IS MISSING?!?!”  Cue Jeffree: my nails will come back eventually  Me: oh..... that’s what it is. Back to the launch 😂😂😂
My God!! That red lipstick collection it's perfection.. like, damn señorita!!  If only.....
do you still do giveaways?!
That thumbnail is everything ❤️
CHoCOlaTe
I’m so excited to get the collection. I’m NEVER disappointed with JSC products!!
PINK PLEASEEEE DOOOO A PINK COLLECTION! That’s like your whole brand,  give it to usssss 💖🎀
YES MISS CAVITY PALETTE
Hows your boo, Kanye?
OKAY MISS COMA....YES HUNTY GO AWF. I want miss coma. I want to be in a coma. I love her.
when he opened the vault I screamed hahahahahah ! AWSOMEEEE
Pink Blood? Love everything as ALWAYSSSS
Where are J* nails at?
People are lik, "Never supporting jeffree star" but you can't deny that jeffree that the "SICKENING" products; better than anything out there
i’m not living for this packaging it reminds me of kylie and kim’s packaging :/
Oh my gosh. The launch date is on my wedding anniversary. That has to be a sign.xx
That wig ugh! STUNNING!!!
Beautiful 🤩
this is QUALITY girrrrl !!!!!!!
I saw cavity and thought what the fuck and then I see the pallet and I need this in my life
Love the new lip shades! When sis said "If you don't know what a vcr is crickets" I died laughing. Did Jeffree get new hand tatts or am I just way late? Also "HeartBeat" gives me Morticia Addams vibes❤
1:06 NOT me googling what a vcr is the moment he said that because it has a different name on my language  LOL
I absolutely love those liquid lips😍😍😍😍
Jeffree, I have 2 Blood Sugars (in case you stop making it) but I will buy this for the red in the middle (also to support you because you deflect cancel culture).
I cant afford to pay that much for makeup but I still watch all his videos x) much love
We need a blush so excited !
First time I see wrinkles on JS
Blood sugar is my favorite of all his palettes! Its so unique, I love it
the highlighter makes your face look oily
I wish there was single shades of the lipsticks 😭 I’m in love with them all but I can’t afford a whole vault. Jeffree PLEASE release some singles soon 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
if I have go to anyone for makeup advice I go to Jeffrees channel! Please if u can do foundation reviews I neeeed help
Stunning!
Why would someone want a mini pallet made up of all the same colors we already have?
I really hope that jeffree keeps the white packaging. I love the white. I think I like the white better then the red. It shows the palette colours so much better
‘Wednesday’ palette 💕💖💗💞💓💐🌸💘👚🍬
what happend to shane
I LOVE CANDY JOINT. I need them all 🤩
Jeffree should release a limited edition; bundle collection of his Blood palettes, and call it “Blood Bank” or something. Palettes could come in a white/Red medical looking  trunk! It would be so cool,  if he brought out a sick limited edition collectors  trunk of his palettes.
BRUH IT ALREADY BEEN THAT LONG SINCE BLOODSUGAR!?!?!?!
Say 'of course' again 😏😂
jeffree showing skin texture 👏🏻👏🏻
Blood Sugar is my favorite JSC palette. I'm so excited for this! 💖💖💖💖💖
Is there a light flickering in this..?
I'm living for the mini Blood Sugar Palette and that lipstick vault tho..it's gorgeous!  ❤️💋💄🩸🦷
Diabetes pallete yeyyy~ rofl
Love the new hoodie and sweatpants
Only thing I'm disappointed in is the highlight colors 😪 was hoping for more pink red not orange
I dunno if I'm the only one, but I'm actually living for Jeffree's natural nails
Man classic Jeffree... Post one video then sell us something
I'm LIVING for the anniversary edition of Blood Sugar and the red vault had me gagged! The mirror is giving me Lilo when she showed Stitch his badness chart vibes and my Disney self is screaming
Dang the natural brow is already gone!!
Hey how about those PPP loans???
I want the entire bottom line of new colour colour liquid lips!!
Did he forget to swatch the third shade??
WHERE ARE THE NAILS WHY ARE YOUR NAILS NAKED OMG
🥰😍💉💄💋
Wish I was special enough to get PR. My money has to go to my baby. Love this so much ! Thanks for all your doing!
omg 16.6 million subs. im so sad
I’m so sad that Jeffree is running out of good ideas 😭
Looking gorgeous in that red wig
This must have been prerecorded before he grew his brows
If you don't know what a vcr is you're to young to be here 👀🤣🤣
I wish the mini had all new shades. I won’t be buying this one for 1 new shade
Dear Jeffree, I don’t know if you will ever see this but, I want to say thank for your music. It kept me from killing myself. I was going through a hard time growing up. Being gay was something you didn’t want to tell being in a country town. Especially your song “Kiss it better” I also remember your MySpace music. I had your song MySpace as my background music on MySpace and used that as my coming out. So I want you to know that I love you! You’re such an inspiration! Xoxo Jake
Iconic 😍
"If you don't know what a vcr is...."  Jeffree... do you mean vhs?
Jeffree has one the best packaging in the world! + the formula is A star!!!
PINK pallet please👉👈🌸🌺
I love the vault but like the last one I can’t get it. I have the entire collection of yours ALL OF IT, but I can’t afford the vaults 😢
Jeffree is serving me very much Bella Thorne
We need to be able to buy the new shade separately. I can’t justify buying the mini for one shade different!
😐
Beautiful! I don’t wear makeup but his videos are like therapy!
That vault though!!! Red lips are everything!!! 💄💋
Did you shave the eyebrows back off?
I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT HOW JEFFREE FORGOT TO SWATCH THE SHADE OUCH
I'm in LOVE😍 🥰
I miss jeffree’s old content so much...
It looks cheap
Amazing!!!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🥰🥰🥰
With how much Jeffree is obsessed with smells, I wonder if he'll ever do a fragrance line?
Is it just me or does the thumbnail look like he’s standing in front of a giant vagina???? 😂😂😂 I know it’s supposed to be a tooth but yeah.... 🤣🤣🤣
That highlighter pallet is a e girls dream. You know the ones who put super pigmented blush and highlighter on their cheeks and nose? I just imagine that red on the nose. So cute.
Did he swatch the brown color?
You’re about to make me sell my whole soul for this collection
where is the famous jeffree star launch nails???
Why did you not swatch the third shade top row the brown shade,m
Where is my red crocodile back pack???? And my mom wants a purse so could you please come out with these please? I love my green backpack but I want one in red! Love you so much XOXO!💋
jeffree should consider doing a zodiac collection
I hope he does a pink one next!
I like your natural nails
I got your jawbreaker pallet
I love the supreme gloss formula 😍✨🙌🏻, I’m obsessed.
...he didn't swatch Ouch...the brown... I wanted to see that.
Everything thing I see came out perfect and it's like having a sister lol
PLLLEEAAASSSEEEE bring back ALIEN !!!!! Its the last one I need <3
Love this! Blood Sugar was the beginning of my JSC collection. Bought it two years ago on a restock after trying out a friends. Excited for the mini and anniversary palette. Also hoping not to break the mirror inside Blood Sugar immediately after getting it like I did before 🤣
This video making me want to play with my blood sugar palette but i want that shimmer red!
omg the joggers are perfect for my period
Y fave color from blood sauger is cavity I were it to school
Omg so excited. The exact colors I always use snd that new color looks so pigmented. Like woah
Living for that white with the red lettering!  Looks amazing!!
There is a typo on the website.. hopefully you guys can find it 😏.
I’m just waiting for a pink palette! 💕
Beautiful especially for Maiko and Geisha
Will a pride palette ever be released
Launches on my 30th birthday!!!!
Idk I can’t get passed the fact jeffree nails aren’t done Idk that would be like seeing him with eye brows ps I said it way before he mentioned it in the video lmao
Kylie dont have nuthin on YOU!!
I’m freaking out! The cavity palette is launching 26th on February and I literally have a dentist appointment on that day!🤯
I just noticed you have no acrylic nails on I dont think I've ever seen you with out acrylics on. Btw love your videos
Awesome Jeffree! 👄💋
I need that vault!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ❤️
Is the mini palette new shades?
Love your palette!
Is Jeffree going to come out with a nail line? Might be why he's not  had any for awhile now?
After couple realeses I kinda feel  like I finally want the lipstick bundle.
Love the cavity pallet and I would love for the misery liquid lip to be a single oh that is so beautiful!!!!
Love the whole red theme 👌
QUEEN❤️
I LOVE bite my tongue and misery. I think it fits my skin color and my vibe
Stunning! Would LOVE to see a pink palette! The cavity skin frosts are to die for!
the wigs have to go 🙌🏼
This is the one video that jeffree doesn’t have crazy nails.
Please make a rainbow vault🌈❣️
I need an orange/yellow palette in my life
You should sell the vault as an empty product also, so that consumers can have their mini lipsticks in the box 🙊 just like the makeup displays
Jeffree is everything ok?
I wonder what kind of back lash he'll get from this video. I swear, he sneezes and it offends someone
I got my Wifey liquid lip last week,  and I absolutely love it! Before this shade, I never thought that I'd be able to pull off wearing red shades. Thank you Jeffree!
Sis what’s up with the nails👀
Congrats Jeffree. I want Everything!!!!!
Who else wanna bathe in Wisdom?  She is literally so gorgeous😍
Was we all watching that and wanting a pink pallet next, definitely a pink lip vault
Can you review Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez!!!!!! Please!!!
It launches on my 5 year wedding anniversary 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻😍😍😍😍
he mixed up VCR and VHS..... lol
Gen Z’s quickly googling what a VCR is 😂
Jeffree’s ring just called me poor during this whole video.
We’ve seen it in your liquid lips and glosses already, so give us a Pastell Palette 😫🥰🥰🥰
I live for dark lipsticks black,oxblood,burgundys. And I also love dark reds. Pink not for me but I love his collection's
beautiful honey I have always wanted the blood sugar pallete but everytime I had the money being aussie they ran out and was unavailable lol sadly but my gods this is gorgeous honey well done to you <3
Not jeffree copying Trixie's blush pallete
loveeee the eye  make-up!
I’m forever obsessed 🤩❤️🎁😍 and the swatches warm my soul 😂😂🥰
omg which was the foundation?? Just distract me the whole video.
I couldn’t stop looking at his foundation(?) the entire video. I don’t know if it’s the primer, the foundation or the powder, but Ms Jeffree Lynn has *never* looked so cakey or had this much creasing.
If I was looking to buy a jeffree product, having his face on the packaging would definitely scare me away...
Are these the  same shades in the original bloodsugar or different couldn't watch the whole thing man's in the house he hears jeffree and he's yelling NO YOU DONT NEED IT
They eyebrows disappeared again
The hair!
I want Doll Parts back!
Pretty lame bro
Follow @deanredmonds on Tik tok :)
Why did you make this? I’m not buying a whole palette for one shade. This was a mistake.
Omg I can’t wait for this collection I have the original blood sugar palette when it first came out super excited for this one congrats
I don't like the palettes 😨
Need to sell wisdom as a single shadow I would love that lol amazing red shade
lol jeff with that Polish flag mirror
that foundation ain't it sis
We need a PINK or a YELLOW/ORANGE palette!!!!
Cotton candy? In Australia it’s called fairy floss.
THE HAIR 😍
My boyfriend: “so you really want me to buy you the same palette because the base is a different color?” Me: “.......”
Wait.. Did I miss the bundles?
Pink palette called Jeffree Lynn (Star), like now please
Jeffrey star you came for @jamiegenieve over her packaging!!! So I smell cardboard on that new Collection.
💖💖💖
WE WANT A PINK VAULT PALETTE💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
I wish he’d do single lipstick again. I don’t wanna spend my money on a vault with shades I don’t want :/
This is gorgeous!!! Especially the blush/highlighter pallette ahhhhh I'm living for the candy pink blush!!😍😍🍭🍬
Did he forget to swatch ouch?
I love your hair and makeup!!
Love everything about it!!! ❤️
I am gooped!!!
I am gagging!!!!!
WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET A PALETTE ORGANIZER?! I was checking out the new site format, it's amazing. And that's when I noticed, hey, we have a plethora of storage options for lip products, but how AMAZING would it be if he developed a stackable palette organizer?! So as new ones come out, you can just get another and stack it in with the rest until it gets filled. It could have different slots to accommodate the different types of packaging
I want a yellow or oranges 💛🧡
I don't own any JS Cosmetics, but wow, do I get super excited when he has a new launch!  Just amazing!!!
Edit: Nvm. He mentions it (sorta) at 3:50 😂  Random question: has anyone else noticed that Jeffre hasn’t had his nails done lately? I notice it all the time now and I’m just wondering why lol
Rose cold ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I'm in love
This video made me want hot cheetos and I'm living for it.
That foundation. Nuh uh
YESS QUEEN IS SHINING ✨✨✨
We say fairy floss in Australia.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I work in a dental office and the thing he said is a mirror is actually a light 😂😂 that made me giggle
I like cherry soda lipstick 💗
Loooove diva and Calabasas. After taxes if I get money to splurge I know what I'm getting!
No matter what every one say‘s, evary One have a past!  Sugar blood was My First jafree Palette and i Love it For ever..: 😘
We need a pink pallet!!!
16 lipstick shades?!? More like 8..... 🤦‍♀️
Bite my tongue needs to be sold separately!!!!! Love it
I’ve followed Jeffree since MySpace days and remain a fan ! I see he gets a lot of hate in the comments, but it’s impossible to live up to the cancel cultures standards anymore. I assume Jeffree is a bit of a diva in real life and is of course going to say or do stupid things once in a while just like anybody else. People have to be allowed to make mistakes and grow. Imagine not only living under the scrutiny of the internet, but having your friends blast your business whenever you have a disagreement with them. I’ve had plenty of arguments with friends and I’m sure I said or did some crappy stuff in response during that argument. How embarrassing it would be if everyone knew those details.  Of course, Jeffree is a wealthy man so, at the end of the day the judgement from the public is probably worth it. But ... not knowing which one of your friends is going to blast you next.... must be lonely. Love you Jeffree, keep living your best life !
So done with this man. I don't care how good his products are. If you're an awful person. I won't support.
The lips are beautiful!
I would love some individual lip minis!
Congratulations Jeffree you are  amazing 😀
Can we can a “Pink Sugar” hi how are ya???  Where is our pink palette 🎨💖💖💖💖💖 love you Jeff 💗
*Dusty pinks.*
No one else gunna say anything about his lack of nails?!
18:42 me when I realized I have to buy this in 6 days....
meh
seems like a money grab
As a dental assistant, I approve! 🦷🪥
The collection looks beautiful 😻
I'm sitting here thinking I don't have to buy the blood sugar palette because I already.... And you go releasing it with different packaging 😂 oh noooOOOO lol
This would have been better timed for as a  Valentine's Day launch. 🤷‍♀️
WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO ME???? I WANNA CRY SO BADLY...... I DON'T HAVE A PENNY TO SPEND ON THAT GORGEOUS VAULT
Girl.....no.
I can't afford any of the collection, so I'm right here watching you and not skipping ads to support. The products look bomb! Goodluck Jeffree 🥳
I gotta have that vault
A barbie palette; all pinks 🥰🥰 please
#Good
I want it all. So stunning especially the lip vault 😍😍😍😍 and please make a pink palette!!
Im glad he created a mini because I am interested in that.
OOO GIRLL NEXT TIME YOU MAKE A PALLET FOR VALENTINES GIRLL PUT IT HEARTBREAKER OOO N MAKE IT PINK 💓💓💗
I’m going to Buy it😍😍😍😍
Am I the only one who is living for Jeffree with less lip filler? They look bomb!
Seeing jeffree without long nails. 😳
Like how do I get on the PR list!!! I am the MOST excited about the mini and the vault!!!
I love the Jaclyn Hill vibes of posting a video one day and a couple days later you're trying to sell something. Yikes.
Jeffree Star w/o nails😳 #shook
I need this hoodie
Youtube has removed the video, but please help jisu  https://www.gofundme.com/f/2aa254kkpc
Okay but that mini is just 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Not loving the photo covers tbh but excited for the mini
Whoever did your makeup needs to be fired immediately
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👄👄👄👄👄👄👄👄
Jeffree may be an imperfect being, but his makeup is perfection reincarnated!
I’m LIVING for tan Jeffree!!!!! 💛🙌🏼❤️
I just rebought Blood Sugar last week. I'm so upset right now 😭
Finally a Lip vault I can use!
Jeffree kinda looks like Lady Gaga here!
So beautiful!
I am dying for the lounge shorts in more colors!!!!! 😭
I love Jeffree but cavities aren't even red, they're black. Also the names suck. Expected waaaaay more out of this palette. :(
Next palette launch: PINK PALETTE PLEASEEE😘 Whatever JSC launched, i always loved it, i wanna buy it but i cant. Hopefully one day JSC can ship to Indonesia😭
like 5 shades in that mini dont need to be there. would have preferred more red shades instead.
💖🙌🏼
Omg..can't wait..I will be ordering the new blood sugar anniversary palette for my vanity..I probably will never use it..just sitting looking fabulous...
Did anyone else not get the notification for this video?!? Just saw on Jeffree’s SnapChat!! Thank you, SnapChat!!  Dear YouTube, You suck sis!!
Simply Wonderful 🌴
To everyone trash talking his skin: it's called texture. Everyone has it. Problem is, most beautubers use filters to mask it. I think it's really refreshing that he didn't.  Orrrr this was a calculated move for his skincare line lol
No not the VCR lol I’m feeling old now 🤣🤣
I love all of it ❤️💄🦷❤️
Will the minis ever become larger sizes? I need them all for my collection!!
Yass cavity I can’t wAit!!!
Would ever be a pallet to help the homeless in California. 😩
Wow it has now been 10 years since I’ve been following Jeffree Star on his creative journey 💕
💝💝💝💝💝💝
Am I the only one who'd love a orange pallete. I wanna do a sunset look
What’s different? New camera? Jeffery’s skin isn’t normally that textured . And he seems anxious. He hand was shaking too.
I love absolutely everything. It’s sooooooo cool
Jeffree you are the COMEBACK QUEEN!! If you guys want to talk to an AI that reminds me of jeffree his name is "Kobal" on personalityforge dot com ...hes trapped in Secobd Life :-(
What's with Jeffree's foundation? Anyone else notice it?
So a mini blood sugar. That was lackluster 🤣
His foundation is a bit 📴 👀 but the collection is bomb tho💯🥴
You didn't swatch the brown eyeshadow "ouch" 🤷‍♀️
Absolutely live for your palettes! They’re amazing! And happy anniversary for the Blood Sugar palette😊🤗❤️
Yah know ever time I watch him he looks more and more like Willy Wonka 😂❤️
Is it just me or did he skip the top right shade in the blood sugar mini palette??
This makeup and hair has me DEAD
Hola
FYI I just ordered a bunch of stuff (a Skin Frost, a lip scrub, some accessories etc) ...scored a free Magic Star concealer for an order over $40 ...checked out on the website in LESS than a minute...AND got the entire shipment in TWO DAYS!!! YASSSSSS HUNTY!!!
Just swatched my blood sugar pallete and tell me why my swatches look nothing like he’s? New formula? My “Prick” is super dry!
"Bite My Tongue" is absolutely Beautiful! My fav out of the vault!
Jeffree, please make a bath robe <3
Misery looks awesome 🥰
Ruby slippers for your eyelids - love that!! ♥️ I love the highlighter blush look, too. So 80s and pretty!!
Misery and bite my tongue have to be full size, please. I have been waiting for those shades.
Jeffree  I’m going to be in labor that day 😭😭😭 I hope I get to buy some ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Never thought I would say that I want cavity😂😍
Candy join& Pink house are like everything no lie Can’t wait to get my fucking hands on them💋💋💋💋💋😍
PINK HOUSE THE HOUSE
Am I the only one noticing that Jeffree's foundation is creasing really bad around his mouth. And I'm buying everything but the vault!!
It is me or his skin looks cracked?
Jeffree Lynn- your foundation....
Woah! His skin looks BAD! That foundation is a NO
It all looks amazing but could you imagine a the gloss in a full red packaging
What’s up with his cheeks?!
I need an orange pallet! 🍊
WHY WASN’T THE BROWN SHADE SWATCHED?? 🤔 🤎 HMMMMM..... 👀
Can't wait to get it ALL!!!
Ugh not you again 😒
man this lipstick Vault is STUNNING time to start onlyfans to fund this shit xDD
Love it
We love you Jeffrey 😍
I NEED that new shade
Oooooo! Triggered to spend my money on it lol😍
uuuuu...i love the red hair :D
Did anyone notice on Jeffery’s middle finger there is a tattoo of a tooth while he was swatching wisdom?
jeffrees really starting to look his age
Not a fan but his makeup is speaking for itself ❤️😍
Is it just me or does his face look different? His cheeks are fuller, more rounded. And are those wrinkles by his mouth around his smile lines or is that just his foundation? Hmmm.....somethin's up
The packaging of the palettes are always fantastic! Loving the whole red background, outfit and hair 😍
No not the VCR lol I’m feeling old now 🤣🤣
Hi. 80s baby here 🤓!  VHS****
Would you ever film a makeup declutter?
WE  NEED A PINK PALETTE!!! :)
Will a Chrome and holo and like bizarre pallet be released like I’m waiting on a world pallet with colours you’ve never heard of
Is it me or is the lip models lip color just changed edited and not actually changed in reality. Her mouth doesn't change shape.
Sell on Shopee please!!!
Aaaaaaaaah i need that hoodie 😩❤️
This is a big flop
Is the white limited edition version still the same shades?
This is so amazing. I definitely need to save between now and the 26th to afford the Vault. I love those new shades
Gorgeous like always 🥰
Okay but him not having his nails done realllyyyyy threw me off 😅😅😅
He skipped ouch
March 16 is the 26th anniversary of my type 1 diabetes diagnosis so I definitely need to add the blood sugar pallet to my collection😍 but I’m sure it’ll be sold out by the time I have the extra money for it😩😩
I’m ready to buy it come on feb 26
Now THAT is a reveal video. Closer, more intimist, close ups on the swatches, no weird echo. Please keep it like this ! ❤ Also, some of the red lippies are sooooo unique and beautiful but I don't want to buy the whole set. Any chance we will see them become full size later on ? 😭 Same, that new shade in the mini palette, are you gonna come up with a single shadow ?? Please please please ?? I'm so gonna get the highlighter palette though ❤❤❤
The lip shades are so awesome and very unique the Sugar Spike looks new to eyes
Ok but can you put the track suits back up 😩
He really forgot “Ouch” in the mini swatch 😩
So does as anyone think the red would look good with green eyes?
Jefree and quality,same club👄
Was there a Valentine’s Day mystery box because I have heard crickets
Make a pink and coral pallete
U could do a bag palette ( u know what I mean) where u incorporate all your fave bags colours and patterns x ( just an idea) btw I have pretty much all ur palettes lol.......like so Jeffree sees🥰💄
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🥰🦋
It's the literal blood of her followers
Will you ever release Poinsetta again???
That is the color I want my hair
I know a lot of people will say that Jeffree isnt kid friendly, but let me tell you how happy it makes me when my daughter Carter sees a new video over my shoulder I always hear "oooouuu mommy can I watch!?!"
Still waiting for my replacement of my mini orgy palette. That one was total garbage. Scared to buy a mini palette after that. It’s been months and he’s had two releases after this or maybe three and still sitting waiting for my replacement that isn’t garbage.
This is the perfect size collection. And I'm so happy you went back to the old reveal video format. I also love that you're doing a bundle with everything in it 😍😍😍😍😍😍 everything about this is perfect
I'm disappointed. This is old stuff new packaging. Pink palette and collection please
I like that I’m watching this on the day that I got a cavity filling today..coincidence 🦷😬
I want Wisdom and nothing else. I'm obsessed😲🤯❤️
Agree a pink palette would be awesome..love ya sweetie
I just realized Jefree’s eyebrows are gone again-
Im jus hype for the skin care line cuz everything else so bom😳
Jeez, *that thumbnail!!* _I GASPED_
God I love the lips. Hope some of they get released by themselves.
THOSE LIP COLORS! Can't wait to order.
hairbyjay really thought he did something with those bangs
Jeffree is probably waiting for a BARBIE PINK moment soon. Itll be a blast and he is probably working on it to make it even more astonishing!!
would you ever make a palette with only the metallic/glittery shades. those are my favorite! Ily Jeffree!
These are so pretty!!!
Bitch imagine if he sold a personalized palette like you could pick all the colors!!! Mix and match
YAAS QUEEN Slay!
Boring af
Im really simple with my eyes, but I love a red lip so I need the vault!! ❤
I mean I know he is cancelled but his MAKEUP is BOMB 💖💖
We need a gemstone pallet! Opal, ruby, emerald, gold, rose gold, silver!!!
Ok, the mirror just looks like a Polish flag, and I am here for it! #PolishGirl
I hope this will still be available on Christmas I want to gift it to my mom!!!
Jeffree we need a all pink eyeshadow palette 😍 🙏.. and build your own palette feature would be awesome 🤩
I'm old and very poor! Can you send me Jawbreaker and Orgy please please please!!! I wish I could get one of the track suits but I'm also to fat! 3x is never available
Love it all
Where’s the ‘ouch’ swatch though?.... 🙈
My own swatches of blood sugar are very far from the look Jeffree has on his swatches, dunno what the problem is but some of them are Just nooooot the same!!!!
Love it
We need JS blushes  PLEASE PLEASE
I can't. Jeffree, I just got my cavitied decayed wisdom tooth removed yesterday and it's painful af. Is this the nature laughing at me?! Lols, that aside that Wisdom is gorgeous on the lid, not in the mouth.
I would have LOVED to see some pallets autographed for this anniversary collection!!! ❤❤❤
Jeffree Lynn where are your nails 🤫😍
Omg I Love it alllll ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Are him and Shane still friends
Beautiful collection!!! Congrats j ⭐️
Jeffree, give us a palette we can choose colors on! Baby you know we’d pay twice for a pallet that we choose any of your colors from. Like holy shit who agrees god I can’t be the only one 🖤🤍🤤
Umm jeffree I think we need a pink pallet!!😍😍😩
JS makeup makes my eyes swell up!
Jeffree refusing to be cancelled 😂
Is it just me, or did Jeffree forget to swatch Ouch lol? I only counted the 8 colors on his hand and he skipped Ouch to swatch Candy Floss🥺 But overall, his makeup products are phenomenal, I'll always be a fan❤❤
PINK PALETTE  PINK PALETTE PINK PALETTE PINK PALETTE PINK PALETTE PINK PALETTE
I love the skin frost highlighter palette and the mirror best
That RING!!! GuRl!!!
Did anyone else catch he missed a shade from his mini? Lol
Keen for that mini. Good mixture of usable shades.
shade coma is ass
Where’s Hair by Jay?
Please go away
Its official, we need the next vault to be a rainbow on with pastels and deep colours. Make it impossible to need any other band but urs
Blood Sugar is so Iconic
Anyone else a little sad he didn’t include the original Blood Sugar liquid lipstick shades in the vault?
I LOOOOOOOVE THE HAIR  YESSSSSSS!!!!!
Pleeease make tooth mirrors 😍 I need a few for my dental office haha
Did you just snatched Lalisa’s bangs-
Is it me or does that blush/highlighter emphasize skin texture?  If I see it on him that would be a way hell no on me
It’s launching on my birthday 🥳
Wish we had a mini vault with like 3/4 minis in. I don’t need that many lipsticks but would love some minis for handbag etc
Are you doing ok Jeffree? You seem sad in your video. Your skin doesnt have the amazing glow it normally does and there is a sadness behind your eyes.
Pink is a shade of red.
February 26th is my birthday ♓ 🥰
I'm seeing at least 5 of those new liquid lips that need to be made into full size!!
What is the lipstick you wear please jeffrey ?
Pastel colors for spring
I want a pink palette as well 💖 all Barbie vibes.
I don’t even like reds before but I own one Blood Sugar, coz that palette is just everything and watching this video makes me elated again.
February 28 is my birthday @jeffree not gonna bather if u sent to me by PR .... lol I love you and congrats for your pallets and your success!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I like your natural nails! They. kayoot.
the cavity palette is dentist approved💯🦷✅
Stunning😍😍 and the pan size im shook😮🙌👏
He should do tye dye crew sweater moment
Jeffree is losing alot of subs. First upload 16.9M Second upload 16.8M And now 16.7M, scratch that it's 16. 6M
They are soooooo pigmented!!!
Im wondering which palette goes better with green eyes ???
Bi🌟ch when she opened the volt lol so red what’s the colours ! Red the house 🏠
Love it all...the joggers are to die for. ❤️
WE NEED PINK <3
Pink joint & forbidden fruit
Cant wait
Ok, the highlight pallette actualky kinda scares me, but its definitely interesting
HIS HAIRRR. DAMNN. GOTTA GET THAT DONE❤️
Is it me, or is the face  foundation cracking? It's not as flawless as in other videos. Hmmmm
Is it just me or did he not swatch the 3rd color in the first top row? The brownish color
Red is my favorite color.  Loving the lipstick vault.  ♡_♡
Hooo I love this palette ❤️😍😍😍🙏
Love the Red! Your Awesome
I wish I could work for you and your brand one day 😭❤️
Can we have some of those vault purples in the main collection! There’s been no recent liquid lips for ages expect the ones out of the nude vault! 💖😭I need some purples!
I AM LIVING FOR HEARTBEAT
Come on vhs box and a VCR is how we watched the two vhs titanic collection had to switch to finish the movie
Omg! Wisdom!!! Bravo miss jeffree lynn!!!
That wisdom red is to die for
Literally just got back from the dentist to get a cavity fixed... lol
Cavity pallete is ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m not impressed. Seems like a cash grab, hardly anything new, except the blushes...this collection bores me
I love a colored blazer!! Hi Elizabeth Warren, how are ya?
Love Jeffree Star but he was not ready to film this launch. Foundation looks awful and nails aren’t done.
i am mesmerized by that wig ❤️🖤
We need a Pink Sugar Collection please
I know damn sure I don’t need anymore makeup but damn I absolutely love the Lip Vault ❤️ and I want that white trunk Blood Sugar. I don’t own it sooooo maybe I should. My husband is going to kill me when it arrives 😅
I’m here to remind everyone that’s he’s not a good person. But I’m sure y’all will keep giving him the power. I feel gross even being here but I wanted to see how many people are still letting his behavior slide....good for y’all I guess?
i would've loved to see a trunk for the mini
I really love your makeup idol. Wow your hair❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💄💄💄💄😍😍😍😍
Ur hair is fucking everything ❤️
Omg love the dental people we are loving this
I wonder when JSC will start releasing their eye shadows as singles?  Love the palettes but sometimes people use one color more than the others or they want to make their own custom JSC palette.
I need the blood sugar mini!!!!!!
Am I the only one who had to search what a vcr is ?? 😂😅
L❤️VE !!!
I was waiting for a tooth mirror 😢
when he mentioned conspiracy palette in the intro I got happy🥺😩
Is the new shade Wisdom going to be available in an individual? 🥀
When will the collection be on sale on Beautylish?
Can you stop making so many beautiful products!!!! I AM BROOOOOOKE   🥺🥺
it's so weird seeing Jeffree without the iconic nails haha
I swear the heart beat lipstick is to die fooor🥺😍😍😍😍😍
I wish he can design a pallet and a mini where the shades are removable and you can organize your own mini with your favorite shades 😭😭
RED IS YOUR COLOR JEFFREE!!  SMOKIN ❣
your packaging is literally always the best
Love u 💞😍💞😍
I thought you had eyebrows again🤔
I Fucking love it all.
Why does Jeffree try and talk like the kardashians... is that what happens when you become rich? Lol
Dominatrix palette??
Please do a pink pallete wow 💓💓💓💓💓
I want to see a Jeffrey 420 pallete with real cannabis infused glosses & lipsticks a blush pallete would be nice to
Wth!!! The vault has all those new colors??? Noooooo 😭
I think you should do an Easter pallette. Do all pastel colors. 🌸 🐰
I got blood sugar in last year's mystery Halloween box. I was very happy to get it!
Jack white vibes
Bite my tongue and misery 🖤🖤🖤😍😍😍
Can't wait!!
I’m sold!
Poland really is everywhere damn
I preferred the previous palettes, personally I don’t like to buy palettes with faces on then
would die for a PR package of all this 😫
Bloody jeffree x 3 and see what happens🩸
OMG that PRICK lip shade 😱😱😱
I love Jeffree.Starr!.I'm OBSESSED!!
who else wants that star ring  jeffree is wearing..
Is it just me or did he miss a shadow swatch from the top row of the mini pallet?
Aww I want some of those lippys in full size bugger
I really want to get the lipstick but I can’t show it off cus I wear a mask all day 🥺
Ok but does this hoodie fit like the og tye dye hoodies, or the Snowcone dyed hoodies?
Jajajaja  No entiendo nada pero me encanta verlo
Thawing out in Texas. Jeffery again you knocked it out of the park and I can’t decide on the lipstick 💄 which is my favorite 😻. The smaller Red Blood 🩸 palette 🎨 is beautiful 😻 again the whole bundle is beautiful 😻.
Still waiting replacement for Mini Orgy palette, will buy nothing from JSC before that
I have everything you make and you products are very good, I would be glad for a PINK PALLET for spring or summer. LOVE SEEING YOU BACK.
My go too pallet ❤️
i want the mini and the track suit!!! i’m so excited for this!!!
God you think of the dumbest names for your makeup
I’m sure when Jeffree makes a pink shade palette, it’s going to be out of this world!!!
As a dental hygienist I need all of this. And a requested tooth mirror pls thanks
you skipped ouch
Pink pink pink we need pink
WOW 25 shades for 160? That's only $6.40 a liquid lipstick. Y'all better jump on that!!!
I actually like the white version of Blood Sugar better because you can see the variation of the shades better!
We are wearing masks.... eye shadows make sense but everything else is senseless.. 🤷🏿‍♀️ I don't get it
❤️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️💉💉💉💉💉💉💉
Jeffrey star without nails is gonna take a mim to get used to.
Image having less subscribers than the kid you tired to ruin and getting less than 1M on a vid. I remember when he used to get 1 million views so easily in a matter of hours and now he barely gets any.🥴
We need a pink pallet and it needs to be called Barbie Blood 🤞🥺
I want pink i want orange i want a palette in every colorrrrrrr
what does a cavity have to do with the actual makeup? i see no correlation??
Ugh! That skin frost tho!!!
Anyone else wonder if his inspiration for this palette was andrenochrome? 🤢🤮
Dammmn i thought I'd never see a falling star......🌠 welcome canceled hope enough people watched to give you your quota.
I need that mini for my sister! 💓 She looks so good with pinks and reds, and it will be right up her ally.
I know what a VCR is 😆...born  in '83 here 👋
I get depressed i can’t afford it 😢
Please please PLEASE review beauty bakerie and their lip wip!!
Omg meee wanttttttt 👄👄👄👄,, I love all the 💄shadessss
Can’t wait for the J* Celebrity Skin Care! Maybe I can finally get up in the J* gig honey!
Looks like the h@irstylist is back 🙄
I need Misery and Bite My Tongue so bad!!🖤😍 gonna get the vault!!
Loving this and all but you forgot to swatch that tan shade "Ouch"
I’m guessing Jay did this wig huh 🤔 hmmmm
I wish that the new red shade in the mini came in a single. As pretty as the palette is I have bought Blood Sugar 2x’s already. I won’t be buying the mini or the white version... but it’s tempting. I wish the new shade was sold as a single 😫😩. JEFFREE YOU KNOW YOU ARE SO WRONG FOR THE ONE NEW SHADE. BABY WE NEED MORE THAN THAT. I feel that in the future we’re going to have a mini controversy moment 😂. I’ll be waiting for that single red shade as a single ma’am. (Could’ve at least put the néw shade in the white edition too)
Jeffree without nails got me so messed up during the entire video :o
I think that the mini was a great idea that was executed terribly. Just ONE new shade???? I expected to see something new.
I'm totally excited for this!🥰🤗✊🏾😇💕
Of all of the beauty creators, Jeffree is the only one that can peddle a palette like a pro on QVC.
Any plans to go sleeker with future eyeshadow palette packaging?
Anybody else noticed that Jeffree’s views/likes are dropping?
Jeffree should not only make a pink pallet but he should put some coral & peach shades in it & call it the “PCP” pallet lol..meaning the pink coral peach pallet. I would buy in a heartbeat.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ && I’m dying for candy joint!! I need it in my life ASAP!!!
Oef.. I had high hopes for the mini, but the container looks kind of... Cheap?? Don't get me wrong, I love jsc. But this container just doesn't do it for me.. 🤨
Not to be mean but he's looking old in this one and good hand was stained from the first set 😢
Jeffree you forgot to swatch ouch the cream color I get tho u excited 😍😍😍 me to not that I can buy it anyway I'm sure price is far for ur brand but still can't afford it maybe someday love you tho. You look good in red well you look good in anything ugh pisses me off sometimes like give us ugly people a break. 🥺🥺🥺
shane mentioned by palette not name shady
Give me that mini nowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 I've never wore red on my lids honey ! You make me wanna try!!!
Brows gone! Lol
Say what you wanna say about Jeffree but hunny he is all about his brand and giving you your moneys worth yessssss❤️🤍❤️🤍
This is love😌💗
8:46 Who tF said that?!  No no, I genuinely wanna know.
I LOVE THE MINI!!!
Do I need that many shades lipstick?  No . Will I use them enough to justify a buy?  No. Do I still want to own this vault?  Yes
Please send one to my door ♥️♥️
That's a nope for me dawg!!!!
i really feel like if i would buy this, because of the price it would be such a shame to use it... such a shame really that you pay so much for the packaging, which is very beautiful but so unneseccary...
When he opened the vault I literally said the F word out loud LOL 😍
That hoodie is a MUST in my collection!!
Looks great but can you please tell everyone why you took money from the ppp loan? Do you plan on paying it back? It seems like you could have kept business going easier than a lot of struggling businesses that weren’t able to get money.
i wish that the well-known neon pink and purple from blood sugar were in the mini. its well put together nonetheless
No lip scrub???
Really dont like the music in the background Jeffree, please stop ❤️
Why am i by myself and going “OOoO” in excitement when he shows a lipstick color 🙊🤭😅
"If you know what a VCR is...  Crickets". Loved this!
Why wasn’t Ouch swatched?? Did I miss something? 👀
yyaaayyyyy love u
good that my birthday is just a month after the release, soo I will get me an early birthday gitf I guess xD the Lip Vault looks soooooo sickening!!!!
Who installed your wig, Jeffree?
OMG.......I CAN'T F*CKING BREATHE😮😮😲😲😳😳😱😱🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 I need ALL of this❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️. My most used by far JSC palette❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ok but are the new shades of liquid lipsticks going to be in a full size?? Cause I'm wanting them big!?!
Have to have that skin frost palette!! 💗❤️💗
Gonna need this ASAP!
Yayy..! The collection is launching on my birthday thats so a.. ma.... zing. 🥰💖🤩😘
14:55
Aaaand this is what I will buy on my birthday - 26 feburay :3! YAY!
I want PINKKKKKK💗💗💗💗💗💗
When does the pink sweat set come back !
Cavity is fire!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Why is Jeffrey on the palettes? I don't like it. Before it was a piece of art, now it's just generic.
might consider getting the revamp, the original one i got was so dry and chalky that the only way i could save it was de-pan the palette and use the shades that way ! hoping this one is a lot better
I would’ve liked to see the mini with exclusive shades.
I wonder how many beautiful gurus is going to order this but not review it because of the trend to hate him? 🤔🤔🤔
It’s his charisma and presence that brings me back.
I love the new shade in the mini but don’t want to buy a whole pallet for one shade since I have the full size blood sugar. Can we have it as a single please
Foundation is hella cakey
Girl, im not going to lie...Your skin looks unbelievable!
Jeffree I love your highlighters and I wish you would do a red liquid highlighter line just like you did with the blues!!! <3
You skipped a shade on the mini...
✨🤩🤩🥰 SUGER SPIKE & CANDY JOINT!!!!
Jeffree..I was wondering if U ever thought of doing a palette that..the shades are magnetic in the pan of the  palette & when U use & use & use..Ur favourite colour & it runs out ...U do get upset...as U just love that colour & the only way U can replace it.. is buying the whole palette again just for that 1 or 2 shade.... That have run out of..U don't always use all the colours in ur palette... BUT...with having Ur palette that U have it magnetic ...U can pull that shade out & replace it with that individual shade..  so that way.. as a customer U don't need to buy the same palette...that U only have 1 or 2 shade..used up..U have used the shit out of it.. to be able to buy the individual.. favourite colour that U have used so much that it's now empty...so if you sold Ur colours individually people can replace just  that colour being magnetic.. I just think some many people would.. fall in love with this idea.. & U would be making money.. because EVERYONE would have that favourite colour...that is empty & the only way to replace them is to buy the full palette again...& you only want to replace one or two of the shades..that you have used over & over again.. this is just idea & I would certainly buy so many of Ur individual colours that I LOVE.. I just think this would be such a hit.. even if U did an empty magnetic case..

, why do you keep on dying your hair
I don’t know who that model is but she’s got a beautiful mouth
❤️❤️💉
🍒
Jeffree...you should do a camo palate with greens, sages, pinks
Niceeee you marvel Jefreystar beautiful 🤩 colección
Im hoping hes naming his skincare brand star skincare just has a ring to it😇
anybody else feel that the amazing channel we subscribed to, has just degraded into a late night infomercial? unfortunate. XM
Omg I haven't worn my blood sugar palette in months, but today I felt like opening her up a she's on my eyes before even seeing this!
Am I the only one that want all new 16 shades to be full size and permanent???
I  want a Cremated and Orgy lippie bundle😍😍😍😍
Everything's gorgeous! Absolutely amazing 👏 😍 ❤  I want all!
Prick. I need prick.
You look stunning!!!❤
YALL is it uni-carton or unit carton 🧐
Yay!
I was literally begging jeffree to release glucose in a single but this will do. I love the red metallic shade in the middle
Fucking love it.  Your products are amazing.
Come thru JEFFREEEEEE !!!!!!
Pleeeeeease don't put your pictures on the palettes 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
So excited for this collection! I like the mini palette and the highlighters! And omg the campaign photos look amazing! ❤️❤️❤️
So creative!!!! Iconic collection!!
😴😴😴
Me sat here with my ocd going crazy because Jeffree never swatched the top right shade on the mini 👁👄💥
The old red pallet and the new white pallet remind me of Insomnia by Stephen King, which is funny because he’s got 2 shades with SK novel names in the vault: Firestarter and Misery. I really love that JS implements SK in his makeup collection. A true fan.
I just want to see more you rather than just make up
I understand why you make the shades exclusive to the vault but damn it would be nice to see the new shades as singles even if it is limited time cause I was interested in a couple but not all.
The mini is all the colors I use in blood sugar
We need a Pink Sugar Collection 💕
Yassss mama ! Revamp that beautiful ish !
Beautiful
Guess who’s going to get her sugar to buy it!!
Love the new red shade. So many palettes launched in just a few years!
I really, really hope this vault comes to Beautylish at some point
So I just have to say... someone commented on his last video saying "who wants to bet he has a release coming?"...she was so right lol
Confused why it’s called cavity and your putting it on your cheeks and eyes
What if Jeffree made a mini palette for all of his big palettes? Oml 😍😍😍
Pink palette? Maybe. Jeffree would create an awesome orange🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡 palette 👌 orange palette with a similar aesthetic as his purple palette    The lipsticks look so bomb 😭😍
The vault!! 🤤
The wig looks AMAZING and I love the mini packaging 🥰
It’s the championship ring for me 😍😍😍
Omfg I so want it all.
Corpse Husband
JEFFREE BEAUTIFUL COLLECTION...BUT WE SERIOUSLY WANT A PINK PALLETTE NEXT WITH PEACHES!!! K THANK. 💗💗💗
I need bite my tounge and misery in my life 😍 red lippies are my absolute favorite
love love love
Candy joint 🤤 🍭
But why is the mini all the same shades i already have :[
My friend got my the blood sugar for my birthday last yr. I love it
The cavity palette shades should of been dentist names like novacane , syringe, laughing gas and drill
Damn he really is needing to dig in the shadows with that finger so hard to get any pigment. I just came here to purposely give this horrible man a thumbs down
Blood sugar is still and will always be my favourite palette above any other from any brand
omg I need the the blood sugar lipstick vault and the mini !
Jeffrey, you are AWESOME😻😻😻
The coincidence of you calling that wisdom while I’m sitting here watching this with ice on my face the day after getting my wisdom teeth out. Iconic.
Wish the mini had more new shades . A true extension of the blood sugar .
my bathrobe is matching the whole vibe of the video
JEFFREE GIVE US PINK PALLETE 🙏🙏🙏
The amount of times in this vid that you say  'my favourite we've ever done' is adorable, your excitement is so infectious. I love this style of reveal video feels like a cute kiki between friends. loved waking up to this 💖
Is it me, or did Jeffree forget one of the Blood Sugar Mini swatches, the top right browny one????
Ooof underwhelming for me
I want those darker reds to be sold full size and individually!! I can’t do the lighter colors, and I’m dying for darker reds, and burgundy shades that are in a Jeffree’s formula. I have from different brands but none come close to JS formula. 😭
I was hoping for blushes not another highlighter pallet 😞
Ive never seen this person without long acrylic nails. Its a little weird to see him without 😂🤣😂🤣
I would love to see you make a body spray or perfumes
Nice wig................
Candy Joint is my new every day, every way lipstick. I love it!
Please do wisdom as a single shadow!! I don’t do reds but damn. I need that
Jeffree make a full Swarovski ruby red mirror please!
i constantly forget that miss thang over here doesn't have any brows
Well done 👍🏽 ❤️❤️
This look though 👌
HOLY COW that's alotta red lol
Bloody for sure 💎♥😍
You should create a Dominatrix style pallet, for all the kinks out there.
Wow. So beautiful!!  I wish I could afford something of yours.
Hi Love Good Like
The Blood Sugar shades look so different against the white background in the new trunk! ❤❤❤❤ LOVE IT!!!
Pink Palette
Would love to see these colours on different shades of people please! We know you got the coin sis😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hey miss mama can we get a pink pallet 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jeffree with no nails.... am I in a alternate universe?
I’m not trying to be rude but what happened to your skin? I know we all ageing but since last video you aged like 10 years
We need a “Jeffree Lynn palette” give us the PINKS! 💞
Will the new lipstick colours be sold separate from the vault? 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
He’s already rich asffff 😫😫 why keep charging these insane prices ???!!? I mean I like makeup too but it’s almost unbelievable how much a lip gloss costs ?!  Drugstore vs high end = literally same ass results, if not pretty damn close...
I NEED that highlighting pallette!!!
Jeffree we need a pink palette!!
❤
aww too bad, i expected a bigger setting and bigger clothes based on the thumbnail...
Would love to see a pastel palette 💗
You missed a shade tho. I mean if someone is just now stumbling upon you, they'd wanna see the quality of all the shades.
That liquid lipstick vault 😍😍😍😍 i need!!!!
Me looking for hate comments 👀
Is the wig hair by Jay?🥰
My wig has officially been snatched all the way to freaking Asia 😳
The packaging is really ugly. :/
Not me contemplating buying the whole mini palette just for one new bomb shade 🤔
Ok im getting your highlighters and mini palette and when i can im buying the vault
I just now bought the blood sugar (that I haven't even had a chance to play with yet) which completed my collection and now own them all. Still wont stop me from getting this collection too. 😍
He's getting old 😔 or maybe it's because of the lighting? The wrinkles :(
Can you buy the sweat pants separately from the hoodie?
Are the liquid lipstick going to be on sale to or is it only the vault.
me only being 12 and knowing what a VCR is  also love the palette jeffree my boyfriends sister has it and we use it all the time  I hope to buy one day
I really hope there will be full sized version of some of these liquid lipsticks. The vault is way too much money for me, but I really would like to try some of these new colors. Especially Cherry soda and sucker punch
GOOD COLLECTION.. THE BEST ACTUALLY
Yes Jeffree!!! You are a genius lol...loving this so much 🥰🤗😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m hoping for a mini matte orgy palette ❤️
I want it all!
Pink veins.  Luv luv luv
My question is, why make a mini pallette if there is only 1 new shade in it and the rest are in the big pallette.... it should have been new shades with more pinks
Pink veins 😍
Plz forgive me beautiful. I'm sorry I don't spell ur name correctly. I use my text spell lolol I'm not used to typing it spelling good. Again I do admire who u are.. I live you thank you for all ur laughs you bring watching ur shows..  Your the best Jeffree
Feb 26th is my anniversary. 18 years (:
I love the vaults! I have the first one and I wear shades I didn’t think I would like. My favorites I reordered in a full size. 💕
still cancelled
Anyone else noticing the decline in views? He should’ve just accepted the downfall instead of us all watching the declining views and sales
I’m still waiting for a 10x magnifying Jeffree star mirror that I can actually USE to apply my make up. Lights would be nice too
we need a pink palette fr
Omg I need that outfit 😍
Will the new lipsticks launch in larger size 🥺
OMG I’M GOING TO BE BROKE!!!!!
The blood sugar Vault design is Beautiful 🤩 wow 💕
VHS box not VCR 😆
Am I crazy or did he mention that there will be bundles for this collection? I rewatch the video twice now… And he doesn’t mention what those bundles are. Come on Jeffree ...  We all wanna know!

And where is the Alien palette remix? I'm just saying...
I need the mirror, the Polish blood in me demands it 😅🤣
I NEED THATTTTT😩OMG
All the reds mixing together hurts my eyes lol Jeffree pls make the background white next time
The packaging is always the bomb ❤️
He missed a color while swatching the mini palette right?
Why no masochist for the vault? Awh! I have tried so hard to dupe her... impossible! That pink scorpio lip!! Loving her.
I need something unique if I'm gonna drop money
Am I the only one who noticed he skipped the brown color and called the second pink brown!😂 No hate I love you,  I'm high af too😂😂
Take a shot every time he says something is his favorite
Your always such a vibe!! 🥰
♥️♥️♥️♥️💋💋💋💋🌈🌈🌈🌈
Jeffree you forgot to swatch ‘ouch’ 😭 the matte swatches are my fav, soooo pigmented & so satisfying
i am in loveeeeeee. i need
No one : He had brows last week
Same old thing just trying to relaunch it under a different name
Are we gonna have an Orange & Yellow moment 🧡💛
Wonder who styled and laid that wig...? 🤔🤔🤔
It’s a VHS unicarton not VCR. VCR is the player not the tape itself
I wish I could get the highlight palette!!! 😍❤
I’m glad I’m old enough to know what a vcr is 🤣🤣
Omg this lip color ❤️👌🏼
Thank you for sharing Jeffree!Hope everybody here becomes successful on YouTube 😊🥰🙏
Giiiirl...you knoow I need that BS mini..I was born with diabetes so, BLOOD SUGAR IS MY LITERAL ENTIRE LIFE. It would he super dope if you did a pandemic special where shipping is free so we can get our Jeffree fix out here in MO girl!
Oh yeah!! Like the new mirror!
I have never wanted money more in my life! Everything in this collection is off the charts! I only have one Jeffree Star product 😢 the Blood Lust Palette 🥰😍🥰😍🥰 but OMG 😱 I wish I could get something from this collection 😢 You can’t find a better makeup company on earth 🌍 and I wish people would stop dragging him! Congratulations 🎊🎉🍾🎈 @Jeffreestar you are an stunning and amazing human and I wish we could clone you! I’m sending you all my love and positive energy 💙💙💙💙
He save the best for the last which is the pink one . It’s gonna be exclusive for sure 🤍
U got rid of ur brows😭
Me: babe I need a new red lipstick Babe: how many different red lipsticks can there be? Jeffree: hold my mirror   Omg I love red lips! I'm excited!
I'm loving your natural nails. Just saying ❤
looks so good!
Idk why I imagined jeffree with a pink mustache ahahaha deceased 😂😂
Please a pink eye shadow pallet!! Next!!!
Miss jeffree I’m scared for the day u ever lose any ideas cause ur products are elite😭
definitely love Rose Petal, was it that color. All the colors are gorgeous definitely!!
Lol, I got a health ad about blood sugar before the vid started.
You so Pretty👑👑👑
@miamaples
I really love the skin frost pallet, that pink highlighter is stunning. Totally getting it just for that haha. <3
Love love love
Wait why did he skip over the brown shade in the mini
Absolutely love this!!! 😍 my real question though, will alien ever be released again? I absolutely love it but haven’t been able to get my hands on a unused one.
It would be awesome if there was a all pink collection
Anyone else notice he didnt swatch the color on the upper rt corner? Cant tell if its orange or more of a brown
Art Collection🎨👑👑👑👍👍👍
I love them all. But idk how anyone could get away with that orange highlighter on there cheeked but that candy frost omg 😍
Ruby slippers for your eyelids indeed
Does anyone ever say ! Yah!!! with  kids ? 😌
Okay but there needs to be darker red eyeshadow shades. 😭
love yhe makeup hate the red background in this video, I can't
I’m definitely buying the highlighter palette and maybe the mini since I don’t own big sister blood sugar 😂🥲 I do own her little step sister  Blue Blood. 🥴🥴
Just got lost in the comments...... looking gorgeous as always make up or not
I wish i could pull off wearing those red lipsticks 💄 I need my teeth completely redone first and it is just way out of my price range unfortunately ..... Congratulations on this launch Jeffree 💜💚💟💛💙
Wish there was bags, lip scrubs  I mean this is cute but I feel like a little meh
The  highlighter palette took me ❤️🤍
Will the new shade from the mini palette be a single eyeshadow like the emerald green from the mini conspiracy? Will the new liquid lips be sold in regular size later on?
lol anyone else notice he skipped over “ouch” in the mini palette and didn’t swatch it?
Im just sitting here  patiently saving my coins patiently for an all sparkling gold pallete full of shimmers 🌟💛
Jeffreeeeee, that foundation on you ain’t the look
Someone knows why he is so obsessed with tooth?
OMG,  SO COOL THE 26TH IS MY BIRTHDAY!!!!! I'M TURNING 50 AND STILL FKNG FABULOUS. GOD BLESS JEFFREE WISING YOU ALL THE BEST AS ALWAYS  GOD BLESS SWEETIE 🥰🥰🥰 XOXOXO🥰🥰🥰
I so hope I get this collection and hope there is a limit to 1 per person!! I can’t wait to finally get a collection of yours!!
😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥 oh my god .take my paycheck.  I need that mini 😍
I know it's very unlikely to be seen by the team of Jeffrey but I would absolutely love if you would consider donating something like 10% of the proceeds from any of your blood sugar collection to a charity focusing around people dealing with blood sugar issues. I have adrenal insufficiency which is the life threatening  illness  that causes me to have hypoglycemic episodes repeatedly.  I have gone into shock, seizures and yes low glucose related Comas. Adrenal insufficiency is different than diabetes and how it affects blood sugar, but being that especially here in America type 2 diabetes is a huge problem and there are a lot of individuals who struggle with type 1 diabetes requiring permanent insulin pumps our community really struggles.  I take absolutely no offense to the theme of this product line nor any of the names of the colors but I have to be honest every time I hear coma I cringe a little bit.  I would just love to see some donations to a cause that would help this community. You have such a wide platform and you could take something as beautiful as this collection and turn it into something just as beautiful by helping people diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes or adrenal insufficiency like myself. It would mean the absolute world to people like me.
Congrats this collection looks amazing
❤❤❤
I really wish the smaller pallet would have been an actual companion vs just repeated shades.  Sort of missed the mark.
What color are you wearing on your lips???
This is a lil offensive to people who have been through bad dental care js colors are cute
I was kind of hoping that he would come out with a lip gloss for this collection..
Damn girl, that ring is errathang!
Jeffree straight up looking like Giorno Giovanni
I NEED to know how much the Mini palette is!... & how much the highlighter palette is, Please?!?  Anyone?!? Prices? Did I just miss it? I guess I must have missed him swatching "Ouch", too. lol. Which I really REALLY wish Ouch could be traded out for Extraction or Fresh Meat!!!!!
Forbidden fruit is my favorite!
that lack of creativity sees that Jeffree is lost and hit bottom !!!!!
Mmmmmmmmm ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Am I crazy or did he skip that brown/orange in the upper right corner?
I grabbed a monster 😂 Red Bull’s are to small for me
I cannot wait to get it all!!! Omg everything is so beautiful!!!
Dude.... DX his makeup was wrinkling so bad!!!!! EW!
I'm in my 40 love your magic star concler
I NEED it allele. Love it
Y’all still support him-
This mini is perfect! I never had a chaance to buy blood sugar and this mini is literally like having the whole blood sugar pllette condensed into one😍 personally i love the burgandy shades in the vault, hope to see those in full size later!
He may be scandalous, but you can't deny that his makeup is next level.
Is it just me or was Jeffree’s foundation really cakey
Okay I love jeffree but I can't ignore the big ball in his cheek... anyone else
The lipsticks!!! Omg I’m here for that 😍😍
how could I ever support this band again :(( it was so good but jeffree is evil
Eeeek yay love this cant wait :)
Might be just exactly what I need! I never got the Blood Sugar palette and I only want those shades right there. This is perfect for me 👀❤️
Well looks like I'll be selling a kidney 🥺❤ cant Express how breath taking his cosmetics are, I've never owned any of them but seeing his swatches uff makes you wanna cry of how good the quality looks and ofc the colors 😭❤
Another Flop?
I really like the look of the set. It’s very eye catching.
The Cavity palette is amazing for summer!
That foundation is terr i ble. Makes him look rad and 20 years older. Getting into his lines. Cancelled da house
comments forgot abt controversies completely
I need them all <3 Jeffree Star goes above and beyond AGAIN! Im deceased
was Ouch not swatched?
Just wondering..Who does Jeffery's make up these days?...It doesn't look as flawless as it use to..Im just a Jeffery stand I believe he has a great personality and IMO he looks flawless without makeup.. Just a beautiful face and skin...BUT -BUT I miss him and Nate being together ..💕
I hope the new liquid lip shades will be available as singles. I don't need the whole vault 😭😭
The eye brows are gone already 🤷‍♀️
G❤RGE❤US!!!! I'm dead!!
Nobody wants to look like you in the 5th  lockdown!
Idk Jeffree Star releases just don’t feel the same... over it.
My favorite eye colors are reds, pinks, yellows, and oranges, and I am soo excited for new pallets in the future. Please please please make a pink collection!
The last 2 lip shades 🥰🥰🥰 I need them
This whole collection is to die for!!! My bday is March 1st I hope I can get something anything from this collection! I really want the skin frost or the hoodie so freakin gorgeous
I can't wait to see all of these all over the next mystery boxes!
Okay but we need a SUMMER THEME PALATTE!!!!
Congrats on the mini Blood Sugar launch!! 👍👍 I live for the whole bottom Row.. yasss. Question ❓❓ Can I purchase these (bottom row) by themselves?? I like the mini Blood Palette.. I would have liked another deeper trans.. color for deep skin.. but I do understand!
Anyone notice those cheekbones?? Holy mama! Yes.
I'm not a fan of Jeffree but his makeup brand is always on point, the quality is insane and no one can say that it isn't.
Omg luv. You look fabulous in red.. I so need to buy that
Everything is amazing ♥️💞💖❤️
So beautiful. Omg. I don’t need anymore makeup!!! 😭😂🤣 But I HAVE to have this 🤗 All Jeffree’s makeup is a WORK OF ART‼️ He is so proud of his products. His entire mood, attitude, everything reflects how much he loves his makeup!! That is the reason I trust his brand, he is involved in every step and absolutely LIVES for his products ❣️❤️❣️❤️💖
Love you in red!! Love from Uruguay!!
LOVE IT!!!!!
I can’t. I’m shook
In have been obsessed with all the zodiac lips.. Zodiac collection please.. Especially for the lips... Btw i am Aries girl js. Xoxox
I'm totally loving the highlighter pallet!!
Very beautiful love it if you’re looking for future suggestions on what to make next how about a pride 🌈 pallet I think you can pull it off
Love you 🤗🌴🏝
Matte blushes please!
Perfect!!!! Love JS
Love it, so prettyy! 🥰
And I lose my job after 12yrs just before those mini lips release 😭
Wait is it not nine shades
My opinion....the sugar Nini pallet was so unnecessary. This pallet was released 3 years ago, meaning that the people who really wanted it most likely would have purchased it by now. Now, this Nini pallet contains only 1 different shade, which means people will esencial y be paying $28 just for one new shade.  Cavity pallet: looks like something color pop would release for about $10
Jeffree Star cosmetics has been on my wants list for way too long I can't wait to try somethings hopefully This year 💟 your packing I always incredible and I'm very drawn to it 💜💚💟💛💙
Can you review Rare beauty
I wish there were more new colours in the mini palette, but who am I kidding, if it’s vegan I’ll buy it.
🖤🥰😍❤️ I need it all!
Those Reds are pretty, Omgg
♥️💋🤍
We are so old!!!! 3 YEARS ALREADY?!?!? 2018!!!)
I need that sweat suit!
What sugar is one of my all-time favorite pallets and I love all of those lipsticks in this collection
When you're only paying for the packaging with the same DAYUM PRODUCTS. Same products different packaging 🙄
Is it just me or is he losing followers
I’m a 32 year old man that’s never done makeup but seeing collections like this makes me want to try.
Omg please release a pink palette❤️🥲
Did you miss the swatch for Ouch?
Heartbeat and forbidden fruit have my entire heart
i adore the nail-less jeffree AND i wish you'd go to your natural hair (wigless)
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Blood Sugar is my favorite palette.
This is the best minipalett so far
I need the vault in my life
Me watching this after i have removed my wisdom teeth yeserday👁👄👁
Tooth mirror!!!!!!!!! That cavity palette!!!!!!I can't!!!!!
I got the original blood sugar pallette for Christmas which I've wanted ever since it came out but I haven't even had chance to use it yet 😭dam lockdown
Ms.Jeffree!  Bare. NAILS?!  😲
I am so happy for u! Another iconic collection!!! Very beautiful!!! 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕 The mini palette is so pretty!
The pigmentation is such a killer ♥️ I tried many brands but I swear Jeffree’s are just the bomb♥️😇
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Drama or not you can’t deny his formulas and especially his reds to be vegan is hard and he makes them this pigmented Kylie could never
looking mighty red there jeffree lol. love this.
no red highlight :c
I'm so excited for this collection!
Please do a yellow palette pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
OMG THOSE LIPSTICKS...THE HIGHLIGHTERS...MIND BLOWING!!!
Red is your color 🌹❤️
Oh wow, I actually really love mini palette, Blood Sugar and Thirsty are my definitely favs and mini one have the colors I use the most, gotta buy it for sure ♥️
Excited for a pink palette 🎨 to come out! Hello 👋🏻
Did I miss the price of the mini
It gets released on my birthday 😝
I love the items but personally I don’t like the pictures on the packaging... to me it makes it look cheap like Kylie Cosmetics lol
*_Anyone else feel underwhelmed with these palletes? Something doesn’t sit right with me about JSTARCOSMETICS since all these things have came out about him..._*
I love how this came from literally nowhere
Soooooo the 16 new velour liquid lips are only available in the vault?
I pray you see my DM on Instagram! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Finally a red highlighter!!! Omg I want and need EVERYTHING!! It’s all amazing and red is my favorite color!!
Appreciate the Mini I haven't even touch the Blood Sugar Pallete so I'll grab the Mini to use love the Highlighter Pallete and love the colored payoff Highlighter and eyeshadow Double bang I wish he would do a mini Lipstick  bundle of the new colors we all don't wear Red Lipsticks ...
OMG YAY!!! My 27th birthday is on the 27th!!! How PERFECT!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
*POV:you're watching this and really want it but you're broke*
Noo! Not a vault .. I can't afford the mini lipsticks vault 😭 At your next launch, could you please do a vault and a regular size mini lipstick packet. I love them so much, but I just don't have that kind of money. Beautiful shades, i love them! ♥️
All dental 🦷 staff looking at this like CAVITY !!!
Can't wait to see this in the discount store. Loser
I only want the mini!!!! #jeffreestar
Omg sugar spike and candy joint 😍😍😍😍
These colors are so"in" right now!
February 26 is my birthday 🥳
I NEED EVERYTHING!
Can’t wait to give you all my monies!! I love them all. 😍😍
Love love! 😍❤❤❤
Cannot wait. That new vault is a must have
Sweet it's coming out on my birthday I hope I have enough to at least buy something from you. Always wanted an eye shadow or grinder or the mirror or the clothes I just want everything
Oh man I want the 16 new lip shades in a set either mini or full! 😍
I wish there were more new shades in the cavity palette-not sure if I wanna spend $28 just for one new shade...but ngl i probably will
So can we get a pink and yellow palette?? Like a sunshine n lollipop 🍭 feel???
the mini BS colors are all but one duplicates?? but why?!!!! i mean why not make them all different so we need both??? i am so perplexed!
Will done 👍🏼
I so wish the lipsticks were individuals! Theres a few of the new ones id love but cant afford the whole vault 🥺
The packaging.....oh my God, it's bomb! The mini palette is stunning and the colors really pop!
I like it but it seems like he’s running out of ideas.
I love the name of the highlighter shades
Queen of packaging
Is it me or he didn’t mention the price of the vault 😐😐
please restock BR website!!!
can Jefree make all the blood palletes the same size? i love how out there the others look but you can't travel with some of them...
Maybe you can make a Jeffree Star Pomeranian Palette and salt bombs shaped like Pomeranian.
OMG can’t wait 🥰❤️🥰
Loveeee the hoodie and joggers tho
So I need the last two lip shades as either a single velour liquid lip, or as velvet trap lipstick. I would wear this colors everyday
He looks older in this video
Disappointed
Beautiful !!!   Shaved eyebrows, I see... Does your Blood Sugar line come with red straws? I need me some RED STRAWS !!! thank you, Jeffree 🩸🩸🩸
*jeffree swatching a red shade* "i think this is my favorite red shade ive ever created"
Is no one going to ask about the foundation he's wearing!? I swear we've never seen Jeffree with creasing, ever! I really hope a) he's looking after himself and b) that's not his foundation in the works!
Few of those lipsticks look like the same color. Same with the mini eyeshadows . But I'm loving the new blood sugar I will be buying it .
Imagine a blood sugar gel eye liner. Deceased!
I love the unit cartons, but don't like people's faces on palettes. Just my preference
Feels weird seeing Jeffree without his nails
Jeffree we NEED a pink pallet!!!!!!!!
So excited for this. Blood sugar is my favorite .❤❤
I’m gonna need candy joint in a single 🥺
Omg I love it all!!! 💓💝💞🌹
Candy joint and misery 😍
Will the new mini liquid lipsticks come in full size at some point ?
We need a pink moment, with coffin packaging 🥰🥰🥰
Jeffree is giving me La Veneno vibes with that wig💕
Jeffree Star is like the Willy Wonka of Makeup XD
Loving your no nails moments honestly ❤️🥰
Im waiting for a whole yellow pallet moment
Thanks for the reminder of needing to go to the dentist ❤️
I can literally see myself wearing EVERY. SINGLE. SHADE!
Will all the products be at other sites like beautylish? Including mirror and lip vault?
Omg for sure more for my collection,I loveeeeee Jeffree Star Cosmetics best quality products ❤️
Candy Joint, Misery and the one next to misery I wnat those and of course I'd love the mini and blush highlighter. Outstanding as per usual!
Will you add the new mini liquid lipstick shades to your permanent collection and regular size
Disgusting don't buy his make up 👆
I need this mini palette
I fucking love this❤ yes
It’s the lip vault for me!  ICONIC ❤️🦷💉💉💉💉
Okay but the white made me wanted to buy it soo pretty
Please please please do a princess (pink) palette!!!!!!!!
Did he left out "ouch"? I didn't see the swatch.
Honestly hate him as much as you want but he knows his job 👏👏👏 I absolutely LOVEE this collection and I’ll fuckin buy it ❤️
I hate that there's so many lipsticks that I want so bad. .... But masks :(
OMG The new blood sugar is stunning fejvsjfvnfd
Omg omg you bringing the red back hell yes baby #JeffreeLynn
Omg the tracksuit👌🏾🤩😍🥰🤤🙈💋❤❣❤❣❤❣❤❣❤❣❤❣❤ I don't wear make up 😔
What is on your lips?! I need it in my life👏👏👄❤😫
Why did the backdrop look like a vagina
These look so cool!! Would love to see an orange/yellow collection someday!!!!
My dentist's soul absolutely needs this collection 😍
Noooo😫 I'm still saving money for the blood sugar palette since the first time I've seen it and now there's a whole collection... I don't earn enough money for this🥲
Sugar spike, pink veins, cherry soda, sucker punch, pink house, forbidden fruit, candy joint
I'm not a fan of when he puts pictures of himself on the products...its such a basic idea and normally he is so unique with his palletes.
Loveeeee itttt
Ughh love this he always brings it
I can’t wait for the day Jeffree sells his eyeshadows individually so we can create our own palette. Very similar to what sugar pill does :)
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻
I hope he does bite my tongue and misery as singles 😍
Idk if it’s the lighting or what but he looks so much older than usual 🤷🏻‍♀️
Really . The packaging for highlighter is so bad But the highlighter itself is amazing
Love it
I FREAKIN LOVE IT ALLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!
Awh love the packaging
Oou I’m early
Blood sugar is my favorite!! I love this
Love it all!!
JEFREEE FLOP STAR. with is PR yes people around him.....TRYING TO BE RELAVENT. JUST. ANOTHER BORING ASS FLOP COLLECTION........ JAMES CHARLES IS STILL IN THE TREND CHARTS ON YOUTUBE. AND GETTING MORE VIEWS.
Sooo cutez!
Shade him or Hate him, his products are breathe taking
So it’s all the same shades hmm idk about that one
Tbh kinda disappointed 😞 love the art on the mini but I thought there’d be more new shades in it. It would’ve been more cool to take the new lipstick shades in the vault and make those into new eyeshadows for the mini or the white packaging. I would’ve loved to see misery as a matte shadow since it’s a unique dark red, bubblegum as a shimmer and then maybe some peaches to compliment the reds and pinks
Not me thinking he was also coming out with a blood sugar inhaler
Hahaha mirror like Poland 🇵🇱
his team is deleting comments so fast 😭😭
Omg I need this collection!! ❤️
I want an Alien galaxy palette... had a dream that jeffree did another alien palette w galaxy swirled shadows. It was probably my subconscious telling me I should have bought the alien palette when it was available.  😔👽❣
viva la poland
I dont know what it is but I really don't like cardboard packaging, especially on such a high end product :/
Please tell me I’m not the only one who noticed he did not swatch “Ouch”🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Yea, I'm going to need the new liquid lipsticks to be sold individually and full size pretty please 😍
My first ever pallet and the first time I ever got your product now I’m ADDICTED!! Have every pallet tons of merch, concealer, highlighters, lip sticks glosses etc!!!
Okay but when are we getting a pink palette! I feel like you’re missing that 💕😩
Giiiiiiiirrrrrrllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!
gaga chromatica album ( diss jefree pink star & bella french )
The ✨hair✨ 😮
How can I  possibly pick my favorites.  I love them all & of course,  you killed it with the packaging! But I have to only choose one due to limited finances,  I will be ordering the vault come 2/26. Love you👄👄👄👄
🔥🔥🔥🔥💕
I don't use make up, but the quality in these pallets look absolutely amazing to me.
I love love love the blushlighters! ❤️💕 Also the mini has the shades I mostly use from Blood Sugar, so perfect! My dumb ass ruined my previous one and had to send her to makeup heaven, oof.
Did anyone notice he didn’t swatch the color ouch?
Okay... I ask after every release... why don’t we have a PINK pallet????
Am I the only one who was completely thrown off by the missing nails? Lol
WOW the liquid lip Vault look STUNNING, you outdid yourself Jeffree 😍🤟🏻♥️
jeffree should have a pink palette named after the highlighter color candy frost
My girls wanted to say "HI"!!!!
jeffree doesn’t hit like he used to 😢
I want more vids of your life, not just you selling stuff.
I neeeeeed that vault!
I want a neon UV glow in the dark palette
Sooo Beautiful ,Jeffery could you make a cheaper line of your makeups,I can't really afford them❤️❤️❤️❤️
Gorgeous
Crap. Now I have to get a few things plus the hoodie to match my blood money hoodie. Lol.  When are you going to dabble in multichromes
love you jefree ❤️❤️😘
This is the first time I'm seeing Jeffrey without crazy nails
That Cavity palette though!!!!🥰😍  Also, I can’t believe Blood Sugar is 3 years old already 😳
everything looks so good.  i need the BS mini!
Oh red my favorite colour 🌹🌹👍👍👍👍
Girl... I think you meant VHS 😄
Congratulations on the 3 year anniversary!!! My twin loves Blood Sugar with a passion <3
How is jeffree so stunning everytime !?
Congratulations Jeffree! The collection looks amazing! 😍
It would be a good idea to use lesser plastics on the products such as those on the mirror, like use a thick kind of paper instead would be a good or those algae plastics that disolves after few weeks on the water.
New Blood Sugar is such a cool collector's item 🥰❤️
OMG the mirror is in the colors of Poland🇵🇱
Love your passion
NICEEE❤❤❤❤❤
Please let this this be the end of blood series😫.Four 1/2 pallets are enough!the was idea okay but i wanted more✨.This seem recycled, played out n pulling at strings😒im skipping this but thiers another blood anything im done collecting PERIOD!!!
Omg Jeffree please please if sold out restock ... Am from Texas and goin thru so much with power outages and no water ... my mom also has to travel SA for her liver failure appointment 🙌🙌🙌... I love everything n wish to be able to buy .. hopefully u see this n restock for people like me whom won’t be able too right that day 🥺🥺.. Btw My girls/nieces/momma and I LOVE YOU 🥰
Congratulations blood Sugar queen Jeffreestar makeup vlog at the world vlog makep mall ladys happy world
I’m buying the mini just for the new shade. I was really hoping for a new palette with NEW shades.
The Vault has all my favorite pink/red shades 😭❤️
I am so glad i waited to buy Blood Sugar (the only palette I dont have) because that white is so ICY and NICE!  I actually want that hoodie too :)
Who did his hair this time ?
Jeffres pic in the thumbnail is truly mesmerising ..
I have the same inhaler as you! 🤣
Honestly...kind of under whelmed...
Im in love💞
SAME CRAP!!!
I want it all, this would've been perfect for valentine's day
As usual, I loved EVERYTHING Jeffree!!!!!!!!! 💋💋💋💋🤍❤🤍❤🤍❤🤍❤🤍❤💯💥
Vcr is the machine... Vhs is the tape so
Mmmm not gonna get these ones I near enough have these colours already, where’s the originality
Omg❣️
Yessssss I cant wait!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍
Love all the pink lip shades! 💗
Omg this collection is epic
Ok hey put your playback speed 0.25x and go at 10:15  hie fake swatches 😂
So.... I think we need a Candy Land inspired pallet. PS...how about a “build it yourself” pallet? May take time for those who get the products together but it’s be amazing I’m sure!  Or...just sell a blank pallet & let ppl do it theirselves. 🤷🏼‍♀️ (I know it’s been done but we know Jeffree will take it to the next level!)
I am just not that excited about it.   I was hoping for more.   Last 2 drops have not been what he usually puts out
♡ i love Jeffrey 🌟.. I wish I could afford his 💄 makeup ♡  ~ I have seen ppl with scars{ like me }  use Jeffrey's makeup to cover up the scars that kept them from going outside. When u gots scars like us it makes us never wanna go outside & cauzes a lot of depression 💔 😪.. But, ive seen his makeup change ppl's lives!! Plus, he's just so amazing 👏 😍 And has worked so hard to get where he is today ❤ .. He really gives me hope to keep going..~  🤗🙌JEFFREY UR THE BESTEST🙏 MUCH LOVE  ❤ FROM CANTON,OHIO
Loving this collection.
I want it all!!!
You should Keep the white and the red if they sell out so fast for the packaging

I would of loved if he put the new red shade in the blood sugar palette I would of bought it but it’s the same as the old just in white 😣 love it though! But I’m a have to pass on this collection
I would wear all of the lipstick colours especially the super dark red ones
I LOVE that cavity palette!!
I want all the new reds in a full size 😭
Hi cakey foundation, HOW ARE YA?
Ok the initial highlighter reveal was a dissapointment...then he swatched it!! Yes please...i need that candy frost in my life. Omg
Jeffrey Im a big fan of your

Jeffree looks old in this video. Like whoever did his makeup didn't use a pore filling primer or something! Never seen wrinkles on his face previously.

Red is my favorite color so this is my favorite pallete
No one:  Jeffree: You guys keep asking why am I not on my palettes!   LoL. I love Jeffree but I don’t need his face on all my packaging 😂
Or if you made mask proof lip glosses and lipsticks so they wouldn’t come off when wearing a mask
Red is my favorite color😍👄👣🎈👗👛👠💋💄💓
So very awesome!❤️🦷
As a polish person all i see in that mirror is a polish flag 🇵🇱 unfortunately
You look stunning hun,the red suits you perfectly ❤
Yeay I was thinking will a blue palette ever be released as i thought that would look really good 😁😁😁
I fucking love Youuuuu! 😍❤️❤️❤️❤️

🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱

I really want foundation
Can we get a PINK PALLET?!? 😍😍😍
Omg I love it!!! But I will say I'm heartbroken that Masochist VLL wasn't brought back :( this collection would've been the perfect time for it. PLEASSSEEEEE BRING HER BACKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I can't believe my inhaler matches my outfit." Umm... I mean, I can.
Yesssss!! So excited for this! 😍
Drag makeup 💄
So exciting! Be cool to see a pink/orange/yellow kind of vibe next for summer 😁🙌🏻🧡💛💖
Omg! The lip vault is STUNNING! I gotta have the lip vault, 9pan palette & face palette! Idc about my allergy to some red pigments, I must have them!  I LOVE a vampy red lip! & so happy to see unicorn blood in the vault!
I think it would be pretty damn cool for the mini palettes, if people could choose which 8 shades from the full palette they want 😄
Is this video old or did he shave his eyebrows again? These colors are beautiful!! ❤️❤️
👑
Great job Jeffree!!! I looove Misery!
Even tho Jeffree has a few things I disagree with and the rumors,  his makeup will ALWAYS. BE. AMAZING! I love this palette and so happy a mini palette is out! THE LIPSTICK IS GORGEOOOUUUSSSS!!!!! I LOVE IT! but we seriously need a pink palette now. . . like NOW!
bite my tongue and misery need to be permanent 😭😭😭 so gorg

Bloodlust mini please?! 🙏🙏😁
I love the packaging!! ❤️ I love everything actually 👀😂💄❤️
Do a makeup tutorial with just Jeffree Star Cosmetics products 😍😍😍
Omg i was just wisdom 😳
"It looks like a VCR, do you know what a VCR is? Crickets!" 🤣. Lady try to get my VCR away from me. I am still playing some classic exercise tapes on mine. Ok, focus on the makeup :)
You look great!  Love the Blood Sugar palette!
Is it just me or does Jeffree’s mouth and chin look really stiff? Like it’s not moving the way it usually does when he talks
We need a pink pallet now mam....thank you 😊 💓 💖
Poland's Edition 🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱
Okay let’s talk about that mini though!!! It’s the pallet I never knew I wanted and now NEED! The mirror is to die for! Love the red heart rhythm sign on the mini!! I can’t wait 😛
Anyone else looking forward to going to more than their supermarket to wear makeup again 😂
I may not like the scandals and everything but I won’t deny his makeup is bomb
U ONLY SWATCHED 8 it gave my ocd a spin
Need Bite My Tongue full size!!!
A glitter/shimmer palette would be 🤩Stunning
Jeffree without nails on make me nauseous
You forgot to swatch ouch
It’s so weird to see Jeffree with natural nails lol
Exciting times, Jeffree! Loved the Blood Sugar. I'd also love to see full on yellow palette one day. The most beautiful, the brightest and the most iconic color, right next to Jeffree's signature pink. 💛🧡
Love you Jeffree Star. Looking very glamorous in red. From James xxx
how many red lipsticks do you want? jeffree: yes!
🥰 my pocket is ouching
I would love if you released an entire metallic or shimmer palette with a bunch of different colors and a base color for each color in the palette
OKAY MS JEFFREY! I’m living for it !!!!!!
This launches on my birthday
i would love a golden palette! can you imagine?!😍😍
Everything looks beautiful! !
😮 😳 😯  EyeBrows Have Gone 😮 😳 😯 What lipstick 💄 is on your 👄 lips Jeffree ❤️❤️❤️
YOU SHOULD DO AN ALL PINK PALLETTE OF DIFFERENT SHADES AND RANGES OF PINKS. METALLICS AND ALL!!!!
I think that just might be best lip collection EVER❤🤍 Damn, my wallet is gonna be screaming & crying but, I just gotta have it. I want the hoody &joggers too. The white packaging with red lettering, yes mama I'll take 1 of everything ⛑💄💉💸💸💸
I needs me a blood money mini pallet Jeffree!
What in the horrible plastic surgery is going on here? I love you Jeffrey but your cheeks look botoxed the house
All those liquid lips will dry before you get half way through them lol. I feel like i have to use a couple at a time
I NEED CANDY JOINT AS A FULL LIQUID LIP I'M DECEASED
3:51 hello fake swatch how are ya?😚😂
Stunning!!!
I need a wig just like that one!!
Not gonna lie not loving the colors on the mini palette but def gonna get the normal regular sized palette
I love Jeffree just doing what he does best!
Why is he looking rough to me?
7:33 No, Miss Mama, I didn't see the eyeshadow named "OUCH" on your swatches. Just to address the   eyeshadow that was left out. :) Thank you for acknowledging it.
Jeffrey I love u but I think it would be a good idea if u use on ur face that type of blush (because people would think it doesn't look good because it looks red) I love u, And I buy everything that I can to support u, just want to leave a comment that I thought immediately when I saw that pigement blush (I think it would be a good idea) good work, keep it good!
I need new full liquid lipsticks. Not minis or lip glosses
i just want orange and yellow palette
I love all your products 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
When are dropping that signet ring? 👁👄👁
You killed it once again!!! Way to go beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
💕🌸💞🌸💞🌸💞🌸 we need a Pink palette 💗
Will afterpay be available?
While the haters are hating Jeffree’s been workinnn! ❤️gorgeous collection!❤️
PINK PALETTTEEEEE thumbs UP PLEASE
What if he made a eye shadow palette called Bad Blood and it had only dark sparkling shades???? Btw LOVE THE NEW BLOOD SUGAR!!!!!
I NEED a rerelease of Candyass dammit 😭
Jeffree needs to cut the Red Bull down.  He's almost vibrating.
Burgundy "Wisdom" is such a beautiful metallic eyeshadow 😍❤️
♥️♥️♥️
MY FAVORITE FUCKING VIDEO EVER!!! LOOK AT THAT RED 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤 i love this and i love Ms. Jeffree  Lynn
Hoping he'll release the 16 new shades in full size later on like he did with the nudes.  I'll get them then.  I DO want that highlight pallet tho, and maybe the hoodie/sweatpants.
"Grab a RedBull and let's get started"   I did grab a RedBull tbh....
No ones going to talk about how bad those swatches are, so light no pigment. Tbh when I wear the original pallet, all the shades are kinda lacking in color and then when you blend it’s almost like there’s no pigment and all the shades look the same once blended out. Sorry I live for jeffree but no thanks on the eye shadows I have to just be honest for this one. But it’s the lippies for me! ♥️
Hello, Hello
Omg I really hope you don’t sell out before I can buy it 😭😭😭😭😭💔
I'm  feeling special as this pallete will be released on my 20th 🎉. Quite a funny coincidence 😁
At least Jeffy-Jeff is exploiting himself and inanimate objects instead of people here. Still sad he's not boycotted though.
Jeffree serving us Satin vibes lol
The fact that he still has fans is mind blowing.
Ooooh can we get misery in a full size?!
I need everything
It feels weird to see him without nails
I have a question. My favorite red lip shade you had was "Anna Nicole". It use to be in your red lip bundle. I can't find it anywhere on your site. Did you get rid of that shade or rename it? And, if you got rid of it, what's the closest shade you have to that?
Does anyone else feel like there’s something “off” about him in this vid? I dunno I’m getting anxious/weird vibes.
I like the pallette when it doesn't have a picture of Jeffree on the cover. It feels more like I'm supporting a makeup company (which sells amazing makeup) rather than just supporting Jeffree who even love I love 💘 needs to separate himself from the company.
Are the new mini shades also going to be sold separately?
Need pink or a galaxy collection
All those lips shades 😍🤤🤤🤤
I’m loving that jeffree is back!!! I wish he would upload more often!
Omg Jeffree you should a done a mini trunk palette moment with this blood sugar collection & some blushes that would of been iconic ❤🙌❤
Love your ring 🥰❤️
Khusra guy chupa party
I love it I really do but just wish you came out with a mini trunk for the mini palette for the blood sugar anniversary. Or PR collectors box editions.
You lookin hot with your red wig... love it❤️❤️❤️
He actually looks good in red
Jeffree!!!! I have to say this is definitely not one of my favorite launches. That being said I wish Jeffree would launch a pink pallet along with a entire pink collection. Some lipsticks, apparel and maybe a blush palette🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀
i love that some of the new packaging is cardboard. better for the environment!
As a dental hygienist I LOVE these names❤
I do like the mini palette but i wish he stopped doing light to dark shades. I have most of his palettes and the light shades are just useless for me.
I actually love him without nails.
well i guess i know what i'm buying myself for my birthday this year 😘❤️
STUNNIN!!! ❤⭐❤⭐❤⭐❤⭐❤⭐
Girl you look fine w no nails... I get so sick of ppl thinking they can just ask others about their life n what they do with themselves. Ppl got nerve
The liquid lips are seriously beautiful 😍
Damn his team be deleting comments like Hillary be deleting emails
Oh my GOD!!!! The red is so cool!!! I’m so getting it!!!!!!!!! Goodness the pink n purple!!!!!!!
The white palette it’s unpractical but BEAUTIFUL 😍😍 I just love that you put Candy Floss on the mini, a lot of people finished that shade and now they don’t need to but the whole palette.
This is the 1st time I have ever wanted a Mini. I'm coming for you!
There's something with the up lip!!
Humble pie 🥧, maybe next palette!    That’s a good name no cap!
IM LIVING FOR THE NATURAL NAILSSS YESSS MSLYNNN
Anyone else notice his foundation? It looks a bit.... Wrinkly.
Living for the mini and the skin frost.
Jeffrey your doing your inhaler wrong love!
Do a full face with all Jeffree Star Cosmetics makeup 🙏🙏
Shoulda named the mini palette blood clot
https://youtube.com/channel/UCDkdy8W7r1Hr95jX6tGnKZQ
Omg I jus love, love, lovvvveeeeee Jeffree❤❤❤❤❤❤ Always slaying...absolutely gorgeous 😍😍😍 Hanging out with u is on my Bucket List!!!!!! Let's make it happen ❤❤❤❤❤
Eyebrows have left the chat
Jeffree this isn’t you what happen to the nails!!!! 🙊
Jeffrey what's with that unflattering foundation!?!?. it's showing every non existing imperfections on your face. And the tone....totally off 🥴
I will definitely be buying the skin frost palette and the mirror!! I am obsessed with the whole collection but I feel the eyeshadows are repetitive! You had a chance to do something that would hit it out of the park! Gotta give it to you, everything looks STUNNING!!! It’s my favorite collection out of all of the collection!
Am I the only one that likes his hands without the nails? 💕
New Skin Frosts!! 😍😍😍💥✨ My favorite JSC product/formula! And this new palette... is... EVERYTHING!! 😵🥰 Take my money, please.
Would love to see him come out with his own unique glitters! Can you imagine? ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You conquered the makeup world, just need FOUNDATION hunnay! THEN GO BACK TO MUSIC 🎶
Whatever foundation that is...they're getting their asses sued
PLEASE tell me you are going to release ‘Wisdom’ as a single for those of us who already have the OG Blood Sugar palette?? ❤️
Misery needs to be it’s own liquid lip 🤭😍 I’m obsessed w that color
Like for the queen of packaging✨💖
I love the vaults so much & the idea of the vault, would love in the future maybe, the customer could chose which minis they want in the vault and different colored vaults, would LIVE and it would be fucking sickening
He didn't swatch "Ouch"..
He’s starting to age
My birthday is the 25th i wouldnt be opposed to you sending me something jeffree lmao
I wish he would have done red glitter letters on the blood sugar limited edition palette
Misery 💗💗
WE NEED A PINK PALLETE💕 please🥺
Finally something I’m interested In again. Living can’t wait to blow my money haha
Please bring back the BOMBPOP mirrors!!!🙏🙏🙏
Omggg hey I love you so much
So can't wait to get one! I love all the reds! My school colors are red black and white!
Packaing is everything! Have them want it!! 💖
I need that vault!!!!
Aww the cavity idea is so cute
Literally LIVING for the red lip vault and sweat set but your girl is broke AF 😂
Just take all my money!!!! 💸💸💸 I need that mini and highlighter pallet
The OG HUSTLE QUEEN 👑❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I would love to buy all of it😍But I can’t afford even one shadow from the pallete
I’ve been saving my coin. I knew the Queen would be releasing a collection soon
That bottom row of lip swatches beds to be in full sized! I adore the redsss
I want those new shades of vll in singles already 😭🙏❤️
I do appreciate the mirror looking like a flag of Poland🇵🇱 definitely sold me on that
Oooo!!!🔥💜👀
I think I was the only one waiting a red lipstick named “Rubi” like the telenovela 🤣❤️
Brand new website but still doesn't ship to Italy 😔 😭
That blush palette,  and the website are fire!!!!! I'm excited!!! Bite my tongue and misery , damnnnnnnnnnn!!!!! 💋💋💋❤
I wanna see a full pink pallet moment, pink eyeshadow is my favorite because my eyes are such a light blue it just compliments them so much. I know it’s probably hard because they’d have to be straight pigments but 🥵 would go for in a heart beat
YAAASS MISS MOMMA!!!! I NEED 2 OF THESE!
does he look different to anyone else?? like a different smile/mouth??
Im lovin that wig, Yyyyyaaaaasssss!
I’m still waiting on the casket shaped pallet for Halloween!
Early
why was ouch not swatched ;((((
I'm soooo beyond happy he's coming out with more liquid lipsticks, I've noticed with the past few collections he hasn't been coming out with as many of them and that's been disappointing for me especially since Covid-19 and having to wear face masks. I'll absolutely be buying the new vault very excited about that as well as the new cavity highlighter palette. I am a little upset that the mini doesn't have more than just one new shade to it however.... so ill be passing up on that one. Can't wait for launch!!!
YOU LOOK AMMMAAAAZZZINGGGGG❣❣❣ YOU NEED TO DO A POMERANIAN PALLETTE ...FOR ALL YOUR BABIES PAST & PRESENT ...CELEBRATE THEM JEFFREE
Will there be full sizes of the new lip shades? That are gorgeous!
I WANT and NEED EVERYTHING!! ❤️❤️
I love this, jeffree is iconic he is always just a mood😂❤💋
I just wanna pop those cheek bubbles.
Instead of ouch I think cake mix would have been a good one. Besides all the reds, cake mix is a favorite shade of mine. I use it all the time. Its beautiful as a transition shade or an all over base for a brown smokey look
Ohhhhh Jeffree,that highlighter palette is to die for 😵
I need the highlighter palette and mini palette in my lifeeeee. 😩😩😩 Just perfection Jeffree. 💖💖
The lipsticks are amazing but the rest not really ..that cavity palette sorry but is not ok 😬 ..the shades are a fail for me and the mini doesn’t make sense ..as is from years ago .So yes lipsticks are the best
So excited about all of these new products!!! Please also keep the nude vault available 🥺♥️♥️♥️♥️
So glad for the mini! Need them reds!!
Jeffree: *30 seconds into video* me:*checking comments to see if anybody else noticed the nails*
Why is there not a mini for Every palette!?! 🤨🤔
Omg i cant wait ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Please bring those red lipsticks out on their own!! (Also please send them to beauty bay!)😂
I feel as though Jeffree only did the e.l.f review so that people wouldnt say he only comes back to promote a product...
i just realized i’ve been watching him for a little over 5 years now 🤧
"BLOOD SUGAR" , LOOKING QUEEN,,,, !!!  J.S❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I guess them big house bills are piling up.
I need pants for my blood money green hoodie please!
hello everyone, have a fab day. xoxo princess
all the year 2000+ babies googling what a vcr is
I think this is the first time I ever seen jeffrees bare nails 😭😖
I hope bite my tongue and misery is going to be sold as an individual
Ya'll can say anything about Jeffree as a person. But you CAN NOT deny the love, passion, creativity and quality you get in his makeup line. It's such an experience getting a package from his line. From the shipping box, packaging paper and product. It's everything. I never felt that way again after opening my last order.
so no blush palette .... 👀
honey the lipsticks omg! i cant believe i liked every one of them! and the hoodieeeeeeee is amazing!
The lack of nails is throwing me off..
Jeffree is the BEST makeup creator in the world🔥The packaging, colors, aesthetics. EVERYTHING is just perfect😍
IM OBSESSED WITH IT ALL 😮 I LOVE  ❤️ ALL OF THE PRODUCTS FROM J🤩❤️🎈🌹 I’m screaming  😱 OMG THE VAULT IS SICKENING, JEFFREE THESE COLORS ARE FREAKING AMAZINGLY GORGEOUS BEAUTIFUL COLORS. YOU OUT DID YOUR SELF ON THIS VAULT 😳 FOR REAL.
did anyone else see that he didnt swatch the shade ouch🤔
Your nails complete your look. Tell us what is happening, that is its own video.  My nails are the same, what a mess.
Love the wig! So sleek 😍
Absolutely LOVE the BLOOD SUGAR Extension! ❤  bc I'm allergic to some red pigments I don't buy/wear red eye eyeshadows often BUT this blood sugar Extension collection is so damn cute that I may have to take the risk & buy 'em all to try 'em out & PRAY I'm not allergic.
Where’s the blood sugar travel bag? I love all of the products in the reveal!!  I am excited about the cavity color..  so beautiful!  Just was hoping for a bag to carry the collection in.
I’m surprised he didn’t do a tooth mirror honestly lol Edit: 1k omg thanks guys, I’m glad y’all agree on the tooth mirror lol
Jeffree I don't  care what people say your products are 🔥! And the pigments  are so smooth it's  like butter. I don't have to worry about tugging eye shadows with yours. Keep bringing it!!! I'm  a pure fan❤
HOW DOES JEFFREE STAR NOT HAVE A PINK PALETTE?!?!!! Sis, WE ARE WAITING!!!! 💕💞💓💗💘💝💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Anyone notice that the skin frost shade "icing ivy" was missing the Y
i love the mini palette
Looks cute but will not be purchasing due to your association with hairbyjay. Sad.
Blood sugar is still the most beautiful pallette ever put out in my opinion! No one will ever come close to touching this red pallette and the formula in my eyes. Blood sugar 3 years later and still that bitch!
He didn't swatch the brown shade
My blood sugar pallet has so much fall out I don’t even use it.
❤🖤
I wish jefree would come out with a light peachy, baby pink, shimmery pallet for us girls that like that kpop glitter moment and don’t know how to do makeup😂
But where is the red highlighter!!!!! 😫😫😫😫🥺
Jeffery...I bought the  blood sugar palette when I turned 60.  I will be getting the min palette and  the highlighter as well.  Nice job always...Judy D.
Lmao the packaging for the mini looks tacky
Ugh I wish Jeffree would stop putting himself on the packaging. It used to be cool and unique and now they all just look like billboards.
Jeffree: If your reading this, I own all of your palettes except the alien because I was on the fence and now have missed out. This highlighter palette and lip vault will be mine on launch day! I have yet to miss out on my purchase on launch day. 😏 But....can I just get a single of wisdom? Can you send that to me? No one needs to know but us. 😂
Amo todo tu maquillaje besos desde Colombia ❤️❤️❤️💕❤️💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
idc about the drama i want this sry lmao
I love the products but i feel like the red was already done, im def getting the hoodie and jogger with the mirror maybe the mini or vault but i was hoping for something different :$ i also feel like these launches are just coming out way too fast, like leave a few months in between XD  a lot of people arent working cause of the pandemic so its hard to afford these beautiful pieces!
Can we talk about how the heartbeat rhythm on the cover is not accurate?
I love jefree Star ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍❤️😍😍
I wish you would’ve split up the highlighter palette with the two lighter ones and two darker ones! Also if I had money, I would FOR SURE get that lip vault bc them are my colorsss
<3
Heck yeah! SMOOTH 60FPS.
Amazing
Everything is beautiful (of course)! Really wish Wisdom was offered as a single, because my Blood Sugar palette is nowhere near hitting pan yet. The mini is cute and I love the packaging. In love with the highlighter palette. If anyone is wondering if you need Blood Sugar in your life, you totally do. 🙂 Edit: New lippie shades are stunning! Hoping some of them will be available outside of the vault.
I love your lipstick you have on.
I think this looks amazing
Same story different day
O.M.F.G I cant wait to try (lmfao) to get my hands on the limited edition blood sugar palette and the hoodie!!!! 🥰 I absolutely love all your products Jeffree
Is there any way you could gift the collection
Yes!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ 🦷 🦷🦷🦷🦷
Oh my goooood
I love the new collection but I wish some of the new liquid lipstick colors were sold individually. I would have definitely bought some of the new colors but I can't afford the whole vault 😭
I have all of your palettes this one just isn't it !!)): Why not make the mini new colors? And the cavity palette cover is so wierd. Will look forward to the next launch.
Is it just me or should Jeffree soooo do a zodiac collection???? btw the blood sugar pallet is #ICONICCC
I love the natural nail Jeffree Star
*JEFFREEEEEE WE NEED A PINK PALETTE*
Save Shane #haters
after i put on face makeup my skin looks flaky and almost scaly like a fricken desert..what can i do to fix this?
This looks so boring. 🥱
You can't deny Jeffree is one heck of a businessperson. He's just good at doing what he does and you can't discredit that.
I’m so excited!!!
Awww I remember when I cared for JSC 😭😭😭
I love your red hair
red
Even tho jeffree ain’t shit one thing about him is he gone come out with some good product.
Did no one else notice he didn’t search the brown on the top right on the mini palette?
I’ve missed you’re reviews and honesty
Whenever you launch new stuff I always wish there was a Zoom Meeting or something of that nature so you could answer direct questions.  There's almost a need for a Jeffree Star virtual beauty counter. It would be a bit tricky cause it might just bring the internet webs down.  It might have to be semi secret. Rumor is the Beauty Guru will be in on Tuesday at 10:00AM.
I love love love this collection and I wish I could afford it but I truly can’t. They are gorgeous though
Im obsessed! Need that mini and the mirror 😀😱
Should have consulted a medical professional to get the heart rhythm correct on the blood sugar mini 🤷🏽‍♀️
I’m excited for the collection i really want that mini ❤️❤️❤️
*gasp* Your nails are naked! 😱
That wig!!! Love it
Please bring back the  Alien palette
Ugh this makes me want like everything.. lol. Damn...how do I quickly make money grrrrrr 🤷‍♀️
Congratulations.
Love Blood Sugar in the white packaging! 😍 It was my most coveted JSC palette and took me the longest to get bc it was always sold out. Kinda sad the mini only has one new shade, but at least I can save some money. I have all palettes except Beauty Killer and Androgyny, and am waiting for the Orgy mini to come back in stock. I don’t buy any other brand’s palettes besides JSC. 💕
omg you are the apple of make up with those packaging and products! i dont even use make up haha i just watch it for the fun! you're successful because you do it from love and passion. I bet it's amazing working for you!
He criticized Kyle Jenner & colourpop for releasing so much collections and he's been doing the same thing,  people still haven't hit pan on blue blood lol ... I haven't buy anything since conspiracy pallet so when I buy the mystery boxes,  I get a little bit of everything.
😀😀😀😀❤❤
You should do an all stars pallete
I honestly do not think the price is too high for the quality and considering Also how much it lasts
Please please please make your lounge wear in xs! Some of us are super tiny but want to rock it!
This is my absolute favorite of all the collections. It took me so long to get blood sugar. I hope i can get this one too.
Hey there Jeffree!! Peace, Love and Positive Karma to you!! I want to focus on the stunning makeup but also feel something is a tad 'off'. It could be my imagination but from the first few moments of the video, there was a HINT of heaviness. I pray I'm making something of nothing. Just know you are amazing and IF anything is amiss, it will pass!!!!!! Now on to the MAKEUP... my favs are Wisdom and Misery. The entire collection is stunning and I am definitely treating myself to the OG Blood Sugar palette. I'm also considering the jogger set, red tye-dye isn't terribly common so I'm loving it!!! Congrats on a fantastic launch!!
I wish I saw jeffree come out with an  all neons palette it would probably be bombbbbbb
Oh My Glob! PLEASE put "Bite My Tongue" and "Misery" out by themselves! They're all I need!🤣❤😂❤
Why oh why oh why oh why should the jeffree star packaging always have to be exquisite and elegant! 🤩
Anddd as fast as they came, the brows are gone! 🤣❤️
😍😍😍😍Bitch! I need a part time job now to afford my JSC addiction. 🙈
Jeffrey, you CAN ORDER QUALITY NAILS ONLINE, AND THEY LAST!!! Suggest ikatehouse.comor simply Walmart. You’ll be surprised by their selection. They have the super long, the coffins, and lots of uni designs 💝💝💝
Hi  I am ari
Will the new velour lip shades be available individually too??
I want to see Jeffree try Selena Gomez’s makeup line so badly. Is Rare Jeffree Star approved?!?
Please make Candy Joint in full sized! Scorpio and Deceased are my go to lip colors, and I need this one but I don't wear red or pink, so I couldn't possibly use the others
Are those lipsticks coming by separate?
Love!
😲 💘 the color of frozen prick.
Wonderful Jeffree. Your the best.
I love ur lip colors! May I make a suggestion? As a black woman, I wud love to see these colors on a black model. Bc let's face it, colors come off differently in women of color. I wud love to c these colors shown on a woman of my color... Ur colors r amazingly beautiful. I just wanted to throw a suggestion out thr... Thanks
FAB!!!!
Ughhh Queen is coming back 😍😍
I wish the mini was 9 new shades, not just one. It should have been a palette to compliment the original. This is just kind of *ugh*   The highlighter palette was a little disappointing too. Just my opinion though.   But the vault, I love it. 16 new shades, yes. I'm all over it. At least just for that I get free shipping.   Overall, this collection just didn't wow me and I was hoping it did. Here's to the next one.
Where’s Maddie? Where’s Nate?
I still fucking love blood sugar it got me into color for the first time 🤤
Girl! What were those swatches? Mess!
I haven’t gotten my nails done since the beginning of the pandemic! It’s freeing not to have the limitations..
×+HACK+× Paint the white spaces between your shadows with clear nail polish. Your collectors item will last 🦷
The cheek filler though
Me and my Daughter are so excited!!! We watch this video and can say we will definitely be buying! 🤩🤩
Jeffree darling, you forgot to swatch  "ouch". Its one of my favorite shades and im literally wearing it right now lol but she wasn't invited to the party on your hand today 😭😂❤
Web site looking good...before was ugly AF
So excited!!!!
I NEed Candy Joint!!!!!
Why is the Conspiracy Palette 40% off now? 🤔
I'm not gonna lie I'm obsessed with this collection, I love anything red 😍
I loved the shade misery I really hope jeffree makes it into a single lippy to sell. I personally love this collection and the cremated collection. I wish I had a bigger following to go on Jeffree's PR list because I have bought a lot of his make up over the years😅
Seeing jeffree without his nails is so weird to me
keep your nails! They are pretty as it is ❤️
lol did he really make a whole uterus line looking like that time of the month . Blood & sugar y'all sounding like shark week bleeding and eating sugar.
❤❤Love all of it❤❤💋👄😍
He’s the only person on this planet who actually looks good without eyebrows 😭😭
I'm obsessed! I'm getting the *Skinfrost Cavity Palette* ASAP! It's everything. I own all three minis And can't wait for *Mini Blood Sugar* to be number four! I just got my first *Velour Liquid Lipstick* in *Venus Flytrap*, & my first single highlight in *Skinfrost: Ice Cold* PS I'm wearing a full face of #JeffreeStarCosmetics in my profile photo. XO Steven 💙
He needs to release a palette called 'The Candy Palette'
I haven't even gone through my first blood sugar palette, why do I feel like I need the mini 🙃
I hope for some of new lipsticks in full size ❤️
We also need a YELLOW 🟡🟡🟨🟡🟨💛pallet and an ORANGE 🍊 🧡🔸🔸🔸🔸🧡pallet !!!! Was just on the website admiring all the pallets in stock !! Need just a few more colors to have the whole rainbow 🌈
Now the big question is... Do I spend my money on the new red Vault or wait for the Mystery Box in March 🤔🤔🤔
Jeffree I love you mama! but idk if you tried a new setting powder or if its the highlighter, but I'm seeing alot of texture around your nose and mouth 👄
Literally the packaging for everything is my favorite ever! BUT I need the 16 New Shades Full size !!!!!!! I miss your new full size liquid lipstick EXPERIENCE!
I love all the products...omg...Love it
Honey, it's VHS, not VCR!!!
Hope the new lip shades will be released as full size singles 🤞🤞
Eyeing that sweatshirt... already have Blood Sugar, not sure about the highlighters, I am too pale to pull them off, some of those VLL though! Yes!
The red vault is like a personal creation done for me!! Thank you!
Everything is so good ❤️
I want it all. And I’m there!
The red looks BOMB on Jeffree
I was hoping for a tooth shaped pallet
Reminds me of the colgate commercial
i love this vid
Why he didn't swatch Ouch?
idk how you find those mica colors or if you mix them, but i love those shades<3
This collection is spectacular!
Can't wait ❤❤
Did he forget to swatch ouch 👀
Jeffree pleasee pleaseeee release the 16 NEW shades full size! Please 🥺🥺🥺 they’re to die for😅😍😍 but I just want the new ones not the vault !!!!
Sweet tooth is calling my name!
Love it was looking forward to this ❣️❣️❤️❣️❤️❣️❤️
He definitely censored a load of words in the comments😂
Launching just in time for my birthday! ❤🖤
Wait isn’t it VHS not VCR?
Is it just me or did he forget to swatch “ouch” in the mini pallet?
Can we get the lipsticks as singles in the future please 🙏 😩
Like it before I even watch 👍
Somebody knows when are we able to buy it ???
Damnnnnnn that palette is bombbb... 🤩 bring it to meee 😈
This gonna steal n seal the whole market!!!!!!!!!
Should have named it High Blood Pressure cus i have one now!!!
This lipstic vault is AMAZING!❤️ also, love old style reveal videos!❤️❤️❤️
oh god the wisdom is so gorgeous! need that mini pallette
Every launch video you make showcases how hardworking and passionate you are about your craft and how hands-on you are on every single item you create. You must have so many employees to work on everything by now but your product knowledge is still on-point as how you've always been. It's amazing.
Jeffree really be looking like ✨Red PowerRanger✨👺
If you wanted it to be a cavity palette it should be blacks and browns 🥴
Did anyone else notice that big ass diamond ring on he's finger I wanna know more about that lol
I really hope he makes more full size liquid lips with the new shades 😭
Omg...jeffree gurl, No Nails! I can't remember the last time u weren't wearing nails in a video. I luv this collection. Thank u for the new launch and vid.
I’m getting my wisdom teeth removed Monday perfect timing for this pallet. I will be getting the mini
ew
He might be cancelled but I still love watching his videos 🤷🏼‍♀️
those pants look like raw beef ew
Jeffrey should lunch an economic  for all of us that can't afford the beautiful expensive ones aaand the ones like me that's lives far away and it's even more expensive to get 🥺 I bet that many people will buy more your lovely products that we all want.
the lip scrubs should have been brought back
😘😘😘❤❤🐩
I don’t believe in bad people, just bad choices. People make mistakes, what matters is if you try to fix it
If this is for the three year anniversary, I wonder what the fifth year will look like. I'm LOVING these minis though. ❤️❤️❤️
Poor "Ouch" just completely skipped on the swatches. What's the opposite for the red-headed step child, since the rest of the family is red?  So.... Any chance the liquid lips will eventually be sold individually? I want exactly three of them.
Honestly I wish he would just come out with single shadows
I love the highlighter pallet. I use the sarcophagus highlighter every day
Jeffree coming for every beauty brands wigs in 2021, #iconic
When is it going on sale?
ok BUT WHAT'S IN HIS LIPS?? this color is everything!
The red in the middle is so pretty omg
I cannot wait! I love your liquid lips so much 🥴❤️
no
Girl, WHY DIDNT YOU SHOVE YOUR PRODUCTS DOWN MY THROAT? They are genuinely amazing like wtf I thought you were just hyping yourself up, BUT SIS WAS NEVER LYING. We need need need a yellow pallet, I can’t find one that matches your quality 😩
Bite my tongue and Misery are my favouritessss,, definitely need then
VHS 📼 is what you meant, not VCR
Yes Jeffrey with his natural nails!!! Finally!! Proud of the natural
I don’t know why but these products just seem like whatever, idk why I expected more ??
I think I fainted when Jeffrey opened that VAULT! GOOD LORD I LOVE THE SHADES!! 💖💖💖  I HAD A SUGAR RUSH!
Jeffree Star: keeps  releasing makeup product  Me: even a lipstick from her brand can't afford🤦🏽‍♂️
Bummed the Mini has just one new shade, I would’ve loved if he made new shades complementary to the Blood Sugar which I already have, I would totaly buy it then, but just for one new shade, no. Love the highlighter palette though 😍 Oh and totaly smart move to release a white Blood Sugar...all the collectors will be going for it even though they have the original 👏👏👏
When are your tracksuits coming baaaack?!?
Proud of you Jeffrey ❤❤❤
Yes!! I love this collection.... the packaging... I’m done. Amazing job, as always, SLAY QUEEN! ♡
I wish I could afford im still trying to replace the rest of my collection that I lost in a fire at my university accommodation
So stoked for this!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
If you don't like him but love his products, buying them doesn't make you a bad person. He employees people, buying his products doesn't just support him. It also gives people paychecks and feeds people's families. I think sometimes people forget that just because a person runs a company doesn't mean that you're only supporting them. You're supporting their employees that need their jobs and paychecks as well
Soooo... I’m literally deceased!!!! Cannot stop screaming I am SO F-ING EXCITED!!!! I. Literally. Cannot. Wait. Til. The. 26th!!!!!!
I love your collection but i can't get it here in INDIA
Bellissimo!!!Sugar Spike 🔝🔝🔝
I have never had a cavity🤣
so beautiful with a pulse! lovez it!
Wow I’m actually early enough that there aren’t any cancel culture comments
Jeffree... you gotta release some of those liquid lips as singles!
That VAULT 😳 AND HIGHLIGHT it's everything 👍👍👍👍👍 thank you Mr. Star Lynnnnnnnn
I'm gonna need that skin frost palette though😬🤫🤩😍
Blood Sugar is literally my favorite palette in the world 😤❤️
Im for sure getting the mini 🥰
I really want to see a black and glitter liquid liners from JSC. Something matte that won't move around and make me look like a trash panda by the end of work. At least 8-12 hour wear.
I'm still patiently waiting for a contour palette to be made with all the nudes from all the pallets prior to the orgy palette! 😭😭😭😭😭
My birthday is the 24th and I get paid that day. Why do I want to make me broke jeffree?! 🤣🌈😜 I need misery in a full lip please!!
The draw strings are everything!!!! Please do that more often!!!
Jeffree this is perfect!! I'm stoked. I need a new blood sugar palette anyway!! Yaaaaassss!!!
Can't wait to try them all!!! 😍 Love the collection colors!!! 😍
Come to INDIA
Wow, these new Skin Frost shades are SO interesting! They are a mix between blush and highlighter and they almost seem like a whole new makeup product! They’re so cool and different, I LOVE them! And omg 16 new lipstick shades??? My wishlist just exploded!!😍
Where are the eyebrows?
Follow me on ig : @narcissistshiv
I don't use makeup, but you are fun to listen to.
Omg! I am in love with this whole collection!!
I was excited for the mini but there is only 1 new shade, that sounds like a cash grab to me... disappointed
blood sugar was my first high quality palette :)  I was super excitted because of the red eyeshadow, which was a rare color in a palette back in the days haha !!!   I still use it and love it ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Buying that mini like asap 🙌〽〰
i need this so bad. stunning
I’m getting the entire collection yes maam! I’ve been growing my collection.
That pink highlighter... So good!
That vault be looking so good!! However, so many shades and not one of them is my fav, exclusive from the winter 2018 collection, Jeffree who
I rlly cant wait for the vault I cant wait. i have the nude one xxxxx
I'm going to buy the limited edition one and I'm going to tear that shit up. Different look every day, even on my days off 😘
I would love for him to come out with a foundation
Oh my god those shadows look amazing with the white background!!
I really want the mini pallet omg
If I don’t get that mini I will cry
The makeup and hair is giving😍😍😍
When he says he loves people that just goes in and messing things, me with my parents marriage :)
I want that cavity highlight!
The collection is launching on my birthday yay
Honey Ms. Jeffree Lynn don't play with her products ok !!!!!!!
Me looking over at my blood sugar palette trying to decide whether she needs another sister 😭😂😂
Omfg cavity 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 I see red people
I swear jeffree never fails to make me laugh at least once
His packaging used to be so nice and now with his "putting himself" in the packaging its just so tacky and really makes me disinclined to want to add his items to my collection
So the mini blood sugar pallets a cool idea at all but why add the same 8 old shades and only add one new shade? For that I’ll continue to use the blood sugar that has more shades including those shade. I’ll miss out on that one shade as gorgeous as it is. He should’ve made the mini with different new colors. It’s only 8 other shades...
I'm so excited
Ruby red slippers for your eyelids...   Get it girl  ^♡^
So excited for the reds in the mini palette he skipped over the shade 'Ouch'  😅
I don’t understand the cavity pallet ... it looks like play makeup . Looking at the product on his hand it looks like it doesn’t melt into your skin it kinda just floats on top . And he just seems off . Not himself . But that’s my opinion from over a screen haha
Anyone else notice the foundation he used didn't do anything good for his skin?
I love this whole collection!
Cavity highlighter palette - giving me peppermint frost mood...
Jeffree, I hate the fake nails, never go back! #PaintYourOwn
Still waiting for Orgy mini....
Really hope that the launch happens on Beauty Bay as well as the US retailers this time!
Give it to me
Your sosososososoosos pretty
i also cant believe that's it's been three years since i have become your fan . You literally blow away peoples mind with your truthful soul . Your products have never caused any kind of drama and they are better than everyone , but there are still many people who don't know you , I guess its time to spread rumors about your all collections around them . Stay blessed and goodluck .
Can we get a grunge palette Jeffrey. A mustard, a balsam green , a navy, an oxblood. Think nirvana plaid
I used my Blood Sugar palette on Halloween for my Queen of Hearts costume. That Sugar Spike color is amazing 💕 I have the Nude Vault, so I guess I’m gonna have to get this too 😂
I need the vault! Omg!!!
This collection slays!! I want it all!!! Especially the lips-omg 😍🥰😘
Frozen prick and Rose cold can be really good for eyeshadows .
Quiero el espejo y los labiales 🥰
Personally I think Your formulas are great, your packaging is stunning and unique. Some of the jokes you make in your videos make me laugh hard. I was so addicted to your make up. Now for the shitty part, I can’t support you anymore because of the cruel things that you’ve done and still do I don’t get why you’re such a ruthless mean person. Your sales would be 10 times better than they are now if you were a better person. I just can’t buy your products anymore I can’t support your behaviour. You’re just so full of shit you tell everybody you fired hair by J and then he’s doing your hair. If you actually try to work on yourself to be a better person I would have no problem supporting your brand again because I do really love it 🤩💞😉
I’m underwhelmed. We are waiting for the foundations, skincare and body care.
Okay, did you get a new camera? I feel like you are standing in front of me! Killer quality
Jeffree! Your nails???? 😱 xxx
Fuck!! Just take all my money why don’t ya 🤤
OMG I JUST HAD ANOTHER IDEA BESIDES THE ONSIES FOR BABIES AND ADULTS. I THINK YOU ALREADY WILL BUT JUST IN CASE... INDIVIDUAL EYESHADOWS AND... EMPTY EYESHADOW BOXES WITH PICTURES ALL THE SHOOTS YOUVE DONE (COLLAGE STYLE) AS A DESIGN FOR THE PALETTES.  SO THEN WE CAN HAVE OUR FAV SHADOWS ON THE GO ON TRAVEL OR WORK, AND WE CAN REFILL OUR ALREADY BELOVED PALETTES 😍😍😍
I need this pallet ❤️
Jeffree please do a give away for this pallet I am obsessed but am a student can’t afford 😩
We need more videos! Miss you!
Im buyikg it asap
I need bite my tongue and misery.  Sigh.
He almost sounds scared of saying price point but other people make trash make up and charge much more
I’m so excited for the collection. I haven’t finished my blood sugar pallet yet and the formula is amazing! I can’t wait to try the highlighters and lip sticks! Such a beautiful collection!
Gonna need Candy Joint in a full size!!!
This wig 😍
Jeffery you are done like jacklyn hill , boring and repeat useless products .
I don't care about his controversies  I just love his products and his entertaining personality...I really get bored watching other creators make-up tutorial :3 But Jeffrey definitely knows how to hold attention... my Stress buster
Misery would look good on me I think with my skin tone
I absolutely love you! You're too much fun. I saw you the other week in Casper and almost fell over! Welcome to Casper!
Okayyyyyy honestly idk what I was expecting but its pretty lit. We need another color story! Wheres that yellow, orange, pink at? :')
Always ICONIC! 🖤 But that VAULT.... I’m SCREAMING!!!! I’m mostly screaming cuz I can’t afford it! 😂😍😩 Still fire tho! 🔥
Iconic
I’m so ready to add another piece to my collection!!! These are so iconic❤️🤍
❤️ the sweatsuit ❤️
Please please please make singles. O Positive is my absolute favorite color!! 😍
I NEEEEEEEED THE CAVITY PALETTE O M G. IT IS  E VE RY THING!!!!!!!!!!
When the star mirror look like Polish flag
Him showing off the colors in his palette and I couldn’t take my eyes off his ring ✨
Yo aquí esperando cuando hará una paleta, de arcoíris
Do I need the pallet? Yes. Am I broke? Also yes. It’s fun being me
This is so cute, I love the entire mini liquid lipsticks vault!!

I'm beyond excited for this!! Blood Sugar is one of my favorite palettes! Now when are we gonna get a Mini Orgy palette restock cuz I want that palette so bad!!
Jeffree didn't swatch ouch
Will a pink palette ever be released 💗
Say what u will,His products are A++...Classy,bomb,High quality...
VHS
i love the lipsticks😍😍😍
I like that he made it a small collection, its easier to appreciate things when they are in smaller portions. I can't wait to get the highlighter and the mini ! I've always wanted to  a mini of this palette !
How much are the new lipsticks separately?
I am absolutely obsessed with reds and especially deeper toned reds. I can’t wait for the Blood Sugar Vault ❣️🙌🏼
Honey I just got a job 😂 my moneys going to you either way 😂
J* can do no wrong! 💜🔥 love ya so much!
As I always say...Jeffree is the Willy Wonka of makeup. Every release is better than the previous one.
Blood sugar missed the mark for me, I was wanting more reds
May I pls just like get the hoodie and sweat pants for free for my birthday because my birthday is February 26th
Omg so excited
Haha somebody is deleting comments
Say what you want, but Jeffree ALWAYS KILLS packaging and formula❤️.. Ugh that Candy Joint liquid lip color🥵🤩
Your makeup products should put it up in the Museum it's gorgeous
Very desapointed where are the black model. To give us the visual for black skin
Nobody else noticed that he skipped the 3rd shadow on the top row?
Hey jeffree, can I get a loan so I can buy all your product?!? 😁 Honestly tho, your makeup is outstanding!! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Jeffree can you make a lipstick the same shade as the pink in the highlight pallet   I have looked everywhere for that shade. Mac use to make it. Called patent pink.  Silky lipstick pencil. 😭 I would buy 20 LOL seriously ♥️ I love your new launch!! All your products are amazing and you care so much! ♥️
Okay Miss Jeffree we need a single Frosting IV!!!
Jeffree, you're soooo pretty. 🦷❤
No one can deny that he only gets on to sell products and or say sorry for his bullshit then takes shots at JH
Does anyone think his brand is declining so he has to go back to the most popular palette and ride on that success
🔥🔥🔥 as usual 🖤
Only ONE THING that bothers me about this collection is that they made the inside of the vault red too. All the red shades just kindof dissapear and for some it makes it hard to see the difference.
Jeffery looks good in almost everything but this red was not it. Sorry Jeffery.
Love. love. love .it all needs to be in my life .I think a gloss with a  red flec could have been fabulous, maybe 1 day .love .love .love 💋💋💋💋💋💋💕💞💕💞💕💞❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Me sitting here watching the video and regretting that blood sugar is the only palette missing in my blood collection I need to get it soon!!!! 🥺❤️
Been waiting on a white ice highlighter like that one. That new ABH was a disappointment when it turned out to not be icy and white so I’m pretty excited for that one!
I hope he sells the new eyeshadow color as a single in the future. I don't really want to buy a palette from one color
I don’t like the pictures on the pallets makes it look cheap and like they’ve not tried reusing old ideas
Everything from this point is just gonna be the same tired old products with different names, I mean how many pallettes can you release before it gets samey and predictable but go ahead and buy it so jeffree can buy more expensive crap and rub it in your faces lol
Hope the dental clinic image was edited, they had a triplex attachment on the highspeed handpiece 🙈
Yaasssss
Iooooove!!
Omg please make the pink and white highlighters singles! And the lipsticks! 💗💗💗
Where jefrees grown out brows go
😩😩😩😩
That highlighter palette 😱😍
Small, jeffree do uou know what SMALL means
Beautiful, iconic, vibrant! Can’t wait to add these to my collection!!!
So its blood sugar? The only thing new is the blush??
This has been my favorite pallette since it launched
You look like willy wonka from Charlie in the chocolate factory 😂
You should be in jail. And we almost have enough dirt on you to make that happen
His eyebrows are gone again
Ohh misery is a must have for me I LOVE darker reds
That lipvault just SHOOK me. I'm so EXCITED  for it but DYING for bite me & Misery. Omg yesss 🔥🔥❤❤
ALL the lipsticks are fucking GORGEOUSSSS. I can'tttt
Why is his skin look so rough in this video? 😦
Soooo Fu....g love it!!!!! ❤
I love everything I see!!! Who else has been a long time subscriber to his channel after all these years?????
When are the mystery boxes coming???
I wanna see a pink themed palette
damnn the vault is 🔥🔥😍
Okay but it’s called a VHS tape... not a VCR 🥸😂 Jeff is brand new..
didnt this girl get cancelled
Red like the blood of his enemies! 😂❤️
I can’t wait for the highlighters! His extreme frost formula is like no other! I get so many compliments when I wear them
Love it ❤
I'm so glad you brought  a mini👏👏
Love it ❤
Did anyone else get dejavu of James Charles releasing a "new palette" but it was the exact same palette... But smaller 🙈🙈🙄
The new Shades Should be part of the permanent collection.
I NEEEEED THIS 😭😭😭
Love the pan size of the highlighter palette!!
Love it ❤
He didnt swatch one color from the mini the top right brown shade
Love it ❤
Love it ❤
Been using Blood Sugar all month on my lives so I’m super familiar with her and yessss a mini will be welcome for when I’m not home and don’t want to lug all my pallets 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 I love all his reds for the lips (Redrum is my fave) sooooo yesss to the Vault..who am I kidding..I want the whole collection ♥️❤️🌟
Low key like Jeffree without nails 🙌🏻
FOUNDATION PLEASEEEEE ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
So, was this color & wig styling done by Hair By Jay too? Asking for a friend.
He forgot to swatch the 3rd shade in the blood sugar mini palette. And also forgot to tell us about the bundles :/
JEFFREEEEEE!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍 i love red and pink... my god this is porn to me 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 thank you so much i saw the web site and.... shipping to Mexico avaible now!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍 now i will shop and get my products faster😍😍😘😘😘😘😘
I thought the thumbnail was sum else I- 😳😭💀
can't we just stops with the shots where he's not looking directly at the camera but just a little to the side? it looks freaking weird.
Can't wait to get the highlighter pallete!
Can’t wait to get it
Ahhhhhhhh omg 💋 💋 love this and LOVE YOU JEFFREE
packaging looks cheap as shit
Love the red vault! I was hoping for more reds and you just did it! Will definitely get it with the mini palette and the skin frost palette.
I need
I don’t understand why you’re selling an entire palette with only one new shade... like I already own them
Who is that Pearson guy 👀 someone drop his @
He looks much better without the brows. 😅
*I HOPE YOU HAVE ENOUGH 4XL & 3XL IN THE SWEATSUITS BC THEY ARE ALWAYS THE FIRST SIZES TO GO WITHIN MINUTES & IT'S A PAIN TO TRY TO GET THEM!*
a lot of those lipstick shades looked the exact same lmao
The cavity highlighter palette is a total NEED!!! ITS SO BEAUTIFUL!😭❤️
am i blind because i swear i didn’t see him swatch the “ouch” shade :( am i the only one???
The brows are gone!
Buy this and you will get a cavity
Umm Jeffree!!! Hello the top row last shade you didn’t swatch ouch!  The second shade sugar cane is a peach color not a warm tone brown haha 😂 Did something go wrong with editing!? You only have 8 shades on your hand!
I wish he told us what he’s wearing on his lips in this video. 😧🤨🧐
Awesome go off girl
❤🖤❤🖤❤
This palette reminds me of my cavity
Ok I need the highlighter palette and the hoodie. Now, who wants to buy it for me? Lol
I actually love his short nails .. Am I the only one? 🤔
YESSS JEFFREE 🖤♥️🖤♥️
Omggggg Jeffreeeeeeee I LIVEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
Femme Fatale on Level RED
These money grab mini palettes are getting super old. It’s insulting to your consumers.
I love everything but even that the mini has my fav shades i wanted a mini with all new colors
I kinda wanted a tooth or heart shaped mirror!
Niiiiice!! OMG the vault!!! 🤩
I really need you to create all these minis in full size. Pink isn't a good look on me but I love those berry reds! I've been waiting years now for you to come back with berry colours but cannot justify ordering that admittedly gorgeous lip vault. And might I suggest minis for all your pallets? Itll make it easier when I pack makeup for my vacation and not have bloodlust take up so much space. I also just ordered blood sugar for your BOGO sale and wont be getting these. But its awesome! I've been searching for a seriously metallic red for ages now.
Yo you forgot to swatch ouch in the mini!!
I live for this! Will Nicole get any royalties for the mini palette because of the packaging? It’s amazing🤍😍
You look soooooo GOOD!!!!
Wish the red lip ammos would of came back
I stopped trusting jeffree when he said “he NEVER got drunk or do drugs , he only eats a lot of sugar” to then find out he smokes and drinks heavy bts. He’s always high
I absolutely loveeeee the idea of a mini!
You've come so far since then. It truly makes me proud!
Jeffree, keep doing you. I dont care what the haters say... you are authentic and you slay
15:10 not me hearing "gold shane"
This was such a trip down he memory lane. I feels like it was so incredibly long ago but at the same time it feels like it was yesterday! ❤️❤️❤️
misery 🤤
Jeffree is the fucking shit🔥🙌🏻
Jeffery looks amazing as always.
when we don't buy your shit so you repackage it as an anniversary collection
So iconic ❤️❤️❤️
“There’s not a lot in this collection you guys...”  *20 new launch items later* 🔥🥰🤯😂
OMG, This collection is FIRE. Can't wait for it. I want the mini palette and the sweatsuit. I hope I get one before it sells out. Good Luck Jeffrey Star on this launch.♥️♥️
I'm so excited
Why aren't liquid lips swatched on darker skin tones
Ok I need to clock something right now....  “It’s my favorite shade” and “I’m obsessed” are two phrases that he goes wayyyyy too over the top with  They can’t all be your favorite sis LOL
Omg !!! Forbidden fruit had to sell my blood sugar platte to help with bills 😭
THIS LAUNCHES ON MY BIRTHDAY 😁😁😁
Is anyone thrown of by whoever did his foundation... You can see it cracking around his mouth. They messed up. Everything else... ON POINT 😍 If i could I'd get the lip vault. LIVING for all the mauves and deep reds.  I still have blood sugar... but I still want the remix version. I feel the colors pop even more. I have sooooo many hoodies but damn this new one sooooo tempted to get it. But with my toddler growing everyday I cant take more space. lol Omg JEFFREE STAR MAKE BABY ONSIES AND ADULT ONES. With the lil window on the butt like the old school ones 😍😍😍😍 Btw im sooo glad he finally used his photo ops for the palettes they were way too gorgeous to just be on paper. Welp ive said everything... I just really loved everything ❤  Love u mama star. Doubt you see this but know you really are doing great things 🥰
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This has been a really hard year for me but I think my credit card can handle the vault 🥴😭🖤❤️
this is beautiful art!
Anyone else notice he forgot to swatch ouch on the mini blood red palette? No? Just me? Lol.
I need to buy this
Whoever told him that we wanted more of his face on the packaging is a ding dang liar, that was literally the only bad thing about the Cremated palette.  Sorry ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ he's a pretty man but i don't want him on the packaging.
Any one else  want coma as a liquid lip?
I'm so glad that the live hand swatches are back!!!!
At least he wears his mask in public.
Astronomical.
A little off topic but........WHERE'S MADDY?!
I will get the mini and the cavity
Thank you for making a product that is packaged amazingly. I just bought eyeshadow palette for over $60 and is was literally the size of a baseball. So pissed!!  Thank you for knowing what you are doing
My birthday is February 25th and I was hoping you would say the 25th but I’m still excited I know what I’m getting for my birthday
Hi MUAS!! I have a genuine question :) whenever a limited piece of makeup is released and it’s considered a collectible, does it keep its value even though it has an expiration date? Since it was a limited edition item. Hopefully that’s not a mouthful, I’m just curious hehe
I'm in love with the joggers! I wish he released some new lip scrubs thoug6
Aww, Jeffree and I have the same inhaler! 😃 Yay for Ventolin!
I want that vault 🤤😍
Free delivery for Philippines please!!!!!!
Glucose needs to come in a pressed powder like the exact same shade but in a monster single shadow on its own
I wish I had 160$ so that I could buy the 💄 vault for my birthday on February 26th 🥲🥲🥲
Why?! Every palette Is half off everywhere, You are not selling baby
Fist collection I won’t get. Pink highlighter and a redo on an old palette Jeffree come on your rewriting makeup.
I think I’m the only one who finds this so boring. How can you run out of ideas that you are redoing something that already did well? Yawn. This is tired sis. Nothing about this video makes me think your website (old or new) will have problems keeping up with demands. Wake me when there’s actually something new from JSC. 🥱
I love my Blood Sugar pallet, i use it for eyes, bronzer and blush. 3 in 1 honey, i LOVE it.
Stunning!
Love you J💗💗💗💗
ok but i already know what ima gift my mom for mother’s day for sureeee ❤️
Can we talk about that personalized diamond(s) ring 💎💎💎
Omg i gotta get that candy joint lipstick because its the same as my favorite shade from bite beauty called thistle
OMG you need you make candy joint into a full size!!!! That one is amazing 👏😍
Wanna see frozen prick on a darker skin tone I bet it's amazing
mmmm it’s the lip swatches only white / light skin for me. do fucking better
Did I miss the fkn bags?
Mini looks like cheap packaging
dont care
Jeffree girl, we NEED those vault lippies in full size!!
Aaaaa omggg! My bank account is freaking out!
I need candy floss as a skin frost 😍😍😍
I am a simple girl; I see red, I click :)
I need candy joint full size liquid lip.  😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
I am living for that highlighter palette!! That pink shade is my whole ass mood! ❤❤❤ and the new mini shade! I was dying for a ruby shade. 🤤🤤🤤
That red shade is the prettiest I’ve ever seen omg
Yeah for a video without all the props everywhere!
Ok, wasn't excited about the nude vault as I don't wear nude shades often, but that red one... need. And the cavity palette.... need.
Idk anything about makeup but still I love jeffree 💙
You guys see those 4 lipsticks that are identical, right?
I’m dying over that vault! Those colors are stunning!!!!😍😍😍
:/ Already got blood sugar... dont need a billion liquid lips and those highlighters seem super impractical- especially since I'd maybe wear two of those MAYBE... Just not impressed with anything he's come out within the last year lol
This collection feels so recycled the shades are not as impressive as i thought they would be and the packaging is a "NO"  for me *if you like the collection buy it! But this is just my opinion nothing more!*
Not a fan of the Mini, normally they have new shades as an extension to the original collection. I wish he'd just made wisdom a single shade like put it back and even maybe made a case for the single shades to go into. Also I might be in the minority, but I don't like it when Jeffree is on the packaging either. I thought it'd be better if it was cohesive with the original packaging. I loved it on Cremated however!   I think I'll just be going with the lip vault this time. It's a shame because I was really excited when I saw the teaser on Insta.
Do conspiracy purt 2
Aren't people in the middle of a pandemic? They barely have money to eat,how would they have money to buy a luxury make-up pallet? U should make a pandemic pallet and give it pandemic names...
It would be interesting to take actual shades of composite filling material or a silver shade like for Amalgam lol just ideas
dang that mini is frickin beautiful and I absolutely love js but jeez im tired of jeffree being so money hungry lately and releasing a new collection like every month, can't even finish one palette before something else comes out! slow the hell down jeffree we aren't made of money like you.
I NEED EVERYTHING. Omg - imma be so broke 😅🔥❤❤
Los quiero todos baby! Deberias hacer el paquete completo! Estoy ansiosa
I gave up shopping for Lent. Omg 😭😭😭😭 *Insert Spongebob's voice when he visits Sandy's house for the first time and he is severely dehydrated, craving water*: I NEEEEEEED IT!
Bloodsugar was my first jsc pallet and it’s still one of my favourites! 🥰
I love how Jeffree talks about each shade as if they are his children and he's so proud of them  :D
Omggg I was waiting for this😍😍😱😱😱😭😭😭😭
Jeffreee why are we seeing repeated colors on your palettes!? This not a new collection this is just using what you already have. Are we running out of ideas!? Is the lab not running? We need story time of what really is going on.
Absolutely love love love ♥️♥️♥️♥️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
That lippy colour is stunning 😩
Is the vault limited addition?
I want all the palettes but can't afford them lol :(
I feel like that red highlighter would look MIND BLOWING on someone with a very deep skin tone!!! Colored highlighters in general looks STUNNING on deep skin tones
Love! Love ! Love ! Everything on this collection, you have amazing ideas your makeup is unique I love it 😻
You know what, I'm kinda living for the no nails jeffree! 🙌🏼
Love You  U Deserve It !!
He can be a mess of controversy but he knows his make up still down with him...
As a first responder I love the mini bravo!!!
Wishing the last two, very dark lips were in full sizes T_T
I really want candy floss highlighter!!!
So ready for this launch. The blood sugar palette has been one of my favorites!! ❤️
I want just one or two of the shades of highlight, are they in singles?? I am def picking up the mini!
You can really tell he is running out of ideas
I definitely can't buy it .. but who cares I ll watch  him anyway❤️
Jeffree looks happier in this video than usual, good
Yup only bak to sell something
its stunning in red packaging, but the limited edition one 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Living and breathing for this 😍😍
Girl that mini ❤️😍 and the cozy set
And you do a video with Billie Eilish
I love you Jeffrey!!!!
Jeffree you should make a cooking video and make brownies while you donate to charity 😊
Jeffree wit no nails is rare!
LOVE LOVE LOVE ❤
Want them all, :-)
#NoFilter
Oh goodness 🥵 that palette!!!
Im highkey dissapointed. The packaging looks so cheap! BASIC. I expected more.
If there is not a museum that contains every product Jeffree has made I'mma be mad
Jeffree Lynn💞 sing on old jeffree song while doing your makeup💞💞
Well the eye brows didn't last long 😂
Don't put yourself on cardboard.  It does not look like a JSC product. It makes it look cheap
Jeffree, thank you for doing your reveal this way & not how you did blood money cause that was a disaster. I like this much better.
say what you will......Jeffree knows how to get it done. I think the white version makes the shadows look better then the original.
👍
That highlighter palette is stunning
Redrum will always be my favorite shade on my lips. ❤️
I’m kinda early xoxo
This is ICONIC 😍!I need it all ❤
Oh Jeffree congratulations!! You deserve all the success you have accomplished!! Don't even know you but I am so very proud of you and all you have done and overcome!! Keep it up you are one of the supreme ruler of the cosmetics world!! ❤️💋😍🥰💄
Oh no plz dnt tell me u shaved ur eye brows again.i looved tht they were growing bk in.
i am in love with you
omfg, ok. I'm LIVING for the Blood Sugar Liquid Lip Vault
Ha ha! 👏 I’ve never seen anyone make an inhaler look so Glam 🤩! I love the full left side of the Blood 🩸 Sugar palette
I can’t wait to get my hands on that Lipstick Vault! I absolutely love my Nude Vault! I can’t wait to get my hands on the entire collection! I already have Blood Sugar and some backups but I’m definitely getting that white packaging! And the mirror is gorgeous! ❤️❤️
That lip vault is amazing
Blood sugar mini is such a wholesome palette 😍
the colour switch on Blood Sugar looks SOOO dope!! I'm living for it
I am not a hater by any means!! I’m just not digging the base make up at all!! Too creasy 😿 ily so much but not sure if it’s the powder or foundation but it’s not working for me sadly buuuuut I’m LIVING FOR THE LAUNCH!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️😻😻😻
Misery for sure 😍💕
Is it me or he missed one shade while swatching the mini?
ladies and gentlemen, the volume inside of this buss is ASTRONOMICAL ✨
omg everything looks bomb 💣 too bad I am too pale for the highlighters 😭💜❤️🧡
Love them all
I love this red!!!!!I'm living for it
That F**** Mirror!!! And those clothes!!!! For the love!!!  So... what's a broke ass mama gotta do to get you to 🎁 me all this?!?!  I Fucking LIVE in my JSC! 🩸💉🍭🤩🥴
The Mirror 😍
Did people really ask for his picture on the packaging? I hate pictures on packaging. The mini blood sugar is a very pretty color story.
Dat vault tho
Blood sugar realness!!!
Least he actually matched his foundation this video
Side note: who else thinks Jeffree would look BOMB with a French manicure?   No? Just me? Okay
Ugh the jogger is INCREDIBLE would be perfect to rock chemo treatments in 😻
I honestly prefer him without the nails.
Es mi internet o no va acordé el sonido con la imagen???
Well this isn't something I would use cause I wear nudes, but I love it all. I hope u come out with a skincare line and some lashes and mascara. That's something I can use for sure.
PR me please I am Brock
I wanna see a Jeffree star foundationnnn
I remember the release of the OG Blood Sugar palette like it was yesterday omg
That red is my favorite color its so beautiful 😍 i love it all ! ❤️
Omg yesssss ... Needing that high light pallet . She launching on my birthday 🥳🎉
I LOVE the Misery shade
When his inhaler even matches ❤️
Why didn't you swatch "OUCH"?
Why not have a Blood Sugar robe?  I'd live for it!
Hello pigment! ❤
OMG that red lipstick 💄💄💄 vault 🤩🤩🤩
Will there be the full tubes of the mini size shades of lip sticks???
Oh girl live .. Let them nail beds breath. And heal . ah feels so good after years of haven them done . just pop on some press ons for a video if need be . your nail beds will thank you
Take my money!!!
This is apparently the moment when I finally get myself a red eyeshadow palette. Also PLEASE release some of the new vault lipsticks as a full-sizes, those are stunning 😍
Yes but I need more info on the mystery boxes please
So happy! I'm on afternoons this week so I can but the cavity pallet at launch!!! Can't wait!
Jeffree looked extremely happy in the video... wow
Wish single eyeshadows were available....I would buy 10 sweeter peach gold shade
Low key hoping he does this for blue blood as well 💙 like please lol
Keep hating, JeffreeStar is the Queen of quality and innovation in the make up world and you know it!
I’m still waiting for my order from the supreme gloss collection to be delivered and he’s out here launching new shit
I loved everything the mini is perfect for travel and the lip vault I am deceased
Did he forget to swatch Ouch?
Personally I'm not living for his face on the palettes, with all the hate he's getting it's kinda a weird move 🤔
Uuu love all red👠🎒❤️
*grabs Watermelon Red Bull*
I literally just bought the conspiracy palette and every time I buy a new palette of his he releases another one.  Every time
*I WISH YOU LAUNCHED WISDOM AS A SINGLE AS WELL FOR EVERYONE THAT ALREADY HAS THE BLOOD SUGAR PALETTE!*
Neither prole nor party member.

Jeffree what’s it going to take for you to put your wealth into Bitcoin? Jeffree Star Cosmetics will go from a multi million dollar company to multi billion dollar company. Now that’s boss.
I want the liquid lip vault!! They’re all such beautiful shades!
The red on red on red has me shook!
"put yourself more in the pallet" bro who said that, thats so ugly :( . i miss the old Bebas Nue Font packaging
If anyone is hesitant about spending the money for the vault it is well worth it and even more Luxurious in person I got the nude vault for my birthday 🥳 and I love it 🥰 my favorite is the ♎️ Libra Lyn 🎃
this haiiiiir ❤️
Now I have to whip out my blood sugar palette 😆
😃😃😃😃😃❣️❣️❣️❣️
I can’t believe it was 3 years ago
I NEED THIS COLLECTION! I am a dental hygienist and this is to die for!!!! Beautiful!!!! I am so excited for Friday!
Extremely disappointing that 16 new lipsticks are only available in a vault, and only minis
Yesssssssss
Sure wish medical personnel could get in first on that sweatsuit >>>> RN here <<<<
I wish that he would have done some beautiful red sparkley glosses with this collection!!!!! 🥰🤩🤯
One day I will be able to afford Jeffree Star pallets......
WE NEED MORE LIP SCRUBS JEFFREE!!!!! PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAASE!!!!
I get the mini perfect for travels
Please make Candy Joint and Bite My Tongue liquid lips singles. Also, Wisdom a single shade.
Shut up and take my money! 💵💵💵💵💵😍
I love the limited edition white box of the blood sugar palette and the mini palette and the spike lipstick ❤️ we need some red metal straws to go with this collection ❤️ to drink out of 😜
Wish there was more comparison to the velour colours he already has.
No nails?  Who dis?
Me gusta la edición especial pero en blanco creo que se va a ensuciar mucho el empaque. Lo demás.... está perfecto y precioso. Como siempre
Not while ago, I was searching for a red highlighter and couldn’t believe you hadn’t it.Finally, it really is Jeffree’s collection. Loved new lip colors 🥰Finally, I will find my perfect red in your lipsticks,I think ☺️🙏
Definitely a VCR moment lol!!! All my peeps 30 and older know what that is.
I'm telling you NOBODY HAS MAKEUP LIKE J*
I dnt want no cavity.. no sweet for me
Waiting for a pink moment 👄🌸🎀💕
omg the other day saw this young boy rockin J STAR jog and sweater I yelled you go Ms Star and he turned snapped and went on his way #love
Im red-green colorblin i hate myself. I could barely see the red lipstick shade difference.
it feels illegal to see jeffree without nails
Love you Jeffreestar great collection
Already the shade wisdom needs to be an individual 😮
Hi Jeffrey!! I would love to see a weekly video from you. Review or whatever. They are fun and funny!!! Congrats on the anniversary of your blood sugar pallet!
Bloodsugar was my first palette from him...now I have almost all expect three.  Should restock cause mine is that old! Perfect timing Jeffree.  And another homerun for a anniversary collection.
I want the vault 😍😍😍
i-
That red shade is EVERYTHING!!🤗❤️
im buying it so hyped see you soonnnnnn stay sister safe
My wallet is crying. I need it all 😍
OMG i love You do mucho early
Everything launches 🚀🌟 the day after my oldest son Jeffrey 12th birthday 🥳 crazy
It's sort of refreshing to see Jeffree without his nails, cuz he doesn't have ugly natural nails lol. I hope the new lip colours will be available to purchase individually without the vault collection.
I was just thinking that jeffree should come out with a red vault!!❤❤❤
Jeffree I'm so sorry that you lost so many subs
i would love to see Jeffree do a fashion show of his favorite outfits with wigs. i do believe that would be amazing to watch.
Hopefully he makes some of those new minis full size. GORGEOUS!!! Mini palette is also STUNNING!
$250 for all the palettes, lip vault, AND mirror?! Just might have to go broke for a minute!
Ok I’ll admit it looks beautiful. I might have to pick this up!!!!
good form red nicki look snatched
Jeffree is a f*kin’ genius!
I'm in love with the vault lipsticks! 👄👄👄👄👄💋💋💋💋💋❤❤❤❤❤❤💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄💄   Jeffree Star's red wig and his massive STAR RING. 💍💍💍💍💍💍💍💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💍💍💍💍💎💎
Another amazing collection as always ❤️❤️❤️
and to think I had said I'm done buy Jeffree's stuff but I really want the pullover and new lipstick vault :'(
This was my 1st jeffree star product!
Blood sugar is my baby and this is stunning but could you PLEASE give us an all pink palette
Omg misery is beautiful I am so excited for the blood sugar mini!!! I'm so there when it releases I've had blood sugar in my cart like 5 times but then I get unsure and I'm like ugh lol I'm excited
Jeffree Star is sizzling 🥵 hot, Queen 👑 is on fire 🔥,,,,, yes mama 💯💯💯💯
Noo he shaved his brows
Jeffree!! *Chefs kiss* 😍😍
jeffree should do a pallet with all his dogs
I use sweetener and candy floss all the time just as a base
Idk how Jeffree keeps coming up with these great ideas for pallets! I wonder what’s next? A pink pallet? A yellow pallet? I hope not but idk!
Yassss queen im in love with everything ❤️🥰
Ok but did Jay do your hair for this one too?
I need those last two new lipstick shades in full! 😱😍
His makeup usually looks flawless but today it’s not it. So much separation and cracking
Ahhhhhh I'm dying!!! I can't wait to buy this collection!!!😍🤩🤩 I've been obsessed with red/pink lipstick lately!
I wish you haters would stick to cancelling him so I could get my hands on this shit! Yall still make sure he sells out! 🤣
I need Glucose in a single pan refill, that is the best white shadow to ever be made. I refuse to buy a whole palette for her tho 😂 x
I use this pallette all the time. Fantastic
That MintMelt video made him realize it was time for that shade of Laura Mercier foundation to GO tg
Omg I need Misery as a full lipstick! Jeffree pls!
I’m still deciding wether I fuck with this red wig or not 😅😂  no hate I love Jeffree but this wig has me perplexed
I love your video
Ugh I really wish I could try that pallet!!!! Blood sugar looks so incredible I’ve been dying to try it for 3 years now!!! Ugh of coarse you come out with newbies! Currently fighting cancer but as soon as I can afford the newbies and the mini I’m getting my hands on them!!! Your so incredible Jeffie! ❤️
Well I guess round about 200$ are getting to be spend 😂
Jeffree you should have Shane back on your channel. Seriously.
Definitely getting the mini and highlight palette... But i have to ask.... When oh when are you going to start a foundation line???? Im patiently living for that..anf the moment where nothing but jeffree is ob my face...
WOW I wasn’t able to buy the first blood sugar since I have no money then there’s another one!!! Ughhh broke life come onnn
I'm trying to save money 😭😭😭 I want the new colors in the vault though
🩸💄🩸💉🩸💄🩸  *EXCITED* !!! 🩸💄🩸💉🩸💄🩸
Jeffree without nails is weird... he is iconic tho
I want it all please! I'll take 2 of each, one for me and one for my daughter 🤩❤🤍❤🤍
Sa3datek li3tak ye3tini amin. 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👄👄👄👄
Wisdom gives me Jessica Rabbit vibes
Is it just me or does this launch look cheap, I really don’t like that he’s put himself on the pallets
Omg that wig is fire
2% lipstick
Waiting for the JS Red Bull collection like...
Las personas que sepan español, lean esto, "se podrán arder, odiar y no comprar los maquillajes de  Jeffree, pero el seguirá triunfando y ser multimillonario" 😏
Baby your foundation is cracking really bad. Hunny... what’s going on?
I literally only want like 4 of the liquid lips in the whole vault cant we get the new ones in full size singles?
Maybe in the future he will make a palette with  blush and couture
He didn't swatch the top right corner shade of the mini.....??
I want that jogger set plus the mini palette. Are the new shades of the liquid lipstick going to be available in the full size as well  ? I hope so I would love to have a few of them. Love ya Jeffree Star Peace and love to you and your family 💙💜
I just used my blood yesterday
Another Hair by Jay wig hmmm...🙄😒
Love you Jeffery
So excited! Such an iconic collection to launch!! Loved that Jeffree went back to introducing his launches in a more personal level rather than the extravagant can’t see way! Kudos for such an amazing collection launch 😍😍
I need that vault
“Of course there’s more” 😂
Yeeeeeessssss!💋💋💋💋💋💋
How can I get the sweat suit? Am from the Philippines.
You look gerogous ❤️
Mini is a MUST BUY! The Liquid lipsticks Vault a MUST as well! The blood sugar white case A MUST buy! Love ❤️ Jeffree Star 💫 his collections are beautiful 🤩...Thanks Jeffree I also hope to see you soon reviewing make-up brands your the best at it.
“HI HOW ARE YA” is always & forever will be an iconic intro
Jeffree please do a yellow palette!!😭💛💛
Omg these shades I'm LIVING
I really hope he will bring out the new colors in larger sizes. I really don't want to pay $160 for minis of the full size ones I already have.
I'm so happy your back again. Best make-up on the platform
VHS*
No one wants it, no one cares, we are leaving you in the past like MySpace ✌🏻
OMG I am Deceased over this collection and I think I have a Cavity after watching this 😍🥰
I remember getting up early and waiting for the blood sugar drop it sold out in like 4 minutes and I was lucky to get on I still have the post card with the pictures. I love this ❤️❤️
HOLOGRAPHIC PALETTE PLEASE 😘😘😘
Jeffree is trying to break the internet again. Lol
Jeffree I want to order some of your makeup but will it come to Armenia?? Jeffree where is your nails I’m use to seeing you with nails
Am I the only one who feels the "Wow Factor" is missing from the Vault?! I think it's cause the handlebar & spinner are not metal looking, like on the nude vault it looked almost like a real mini safe🤔 And I'm soooo torn by this cause I REALLY want all these new shades 😭 but this red vault is so cheesy!!
I hate that you can’t buy the new shades by themselfs in the full component. :/
I would’ve liked some of those new lipstick colors in the blood sugar mini. I can’t see buying the mini when I have all the colors except for one.
This is my favorite pallet
Hate nothing. LOVE it ALL ❤️❤️❤️
that mini eyeshadow!!!!! ghaaaadddd 😍😍😍 hope that JSC will be available in PH like all ALL products 🥺
Ok is it just me, or does anyone else low key wat to see Jeffree do a full face of Jeffree Star makeup? I think that would be so fun. I think he could do it. I know he doesn't have a foundation line (... yet). But still the looks are endless
I mean he’s a terrible person but he’s got great products
No Designer Blood in the vault 🥺 Also I will fucking DIE if you bring Misery, Bite My Tongue, and Heartbeat to your permanent collection. Those reds are all I need in my life. Pleeeaaaaseee
Painting the world red! ❤️🍒💋🩸🎈
This launch is on my 5th wedding anniversary! How cool what a fun surprise it would he to get this launch.
Jeffree without his nails makes me feel the world is off its axis🤪 I hope some of those berry/pinks lippies are full size one day! Gorgeous colors!!
IS IT WIERD THAT I WENT TO THE DENTIST THIS MORNING??? ....that’s some bullshit
Sis we couldn’t care less 💅
I love the shade misery
ummm HI, the Blood Sugar collection is my whole heart, and this special edition re-release is PERFECT for my BIRTHDAY!! YAAAAS! Happy birthday to me!!! Stunning job Jeffree! Those two campaign images are my FAVORITES you've ever done so I am SO EXCITED to have them on the products! Bitch I am GAGGED. 🦷💉🩸🍬
And I hope to get the big bundle. So pray to GOSH it wont sell out and I'll be able to get it!

Jeffree babe do you want to just sling me a lip vault? I think I deserve it
Will the new liquid lips be sold as full size individuals at any point?? I’m really loving Candy Joint!! 😍
Is it just me or is that foundation not working for Jeffree his skin has always been flawless but this foundation is making his beautiful skin look really bad

Those lip shades are everything!!!!
Am I the only one who wants an Affordable collection called hard times?  Something that feels like thirsty but different
Cool inhaler. 😋
I loved that when he did the mini swatches he forgot to swatch "ouch"
Jeffree when are you going to drop a blush collection??? We need this from you!
Awesome as always, hi from the UK xx
No one does reds like Jeffree! This collection is sickening and i cant wait to review all the new products! ❤️🦷 HAPPY ANNIVERSARY

These lips are beautiful I’m going to need a bigger closet 🤦🏻‍♀️
Pretty a pretty blusher
I’m obsessed with the background 😻❤️❤️❤️
I need it all! I wish the some of the new lippies were available without the vault. But all in all everything looks amazingly beautiful 😍
I’m upset that the popsicle mirrors sold out already!! I’ve been working hard to make money to buy both and of course it’s sold out
Not me upset because there is no glosses 🥺
This is more than a makeup palette. Its a piece of art. The red colors are just sickening !!!
Red everything bish!
She said 100k views 30 minutes.
I need everything ❤🤍
Jeffree is always STUNNING😍
Who said put him on the palette 😡
am I the only one who recognized that he only swatched 8 shades of the mini palette 😅
We need a lip to match that beautiful wisdom...that color as a lip color 🥰 I spoke to soon lol there is a lip for it lo
Did I blink and miss the swatch for the color Ouch in the mini palette? Am I the only one who noticed that?
Beautiful Jeffree😍❤
Why does Jeffree look A LOT older in this video.. like.. 40s
Is it just me.... or did he forget to swatch "ouch" the brown.... in the mini?
Love itttt
When Jeffree uploads a product reveal video my boyfriend calls me to make sure I've seen it lol he knows how much i love JSC products 🥰😍💕💕
I need everything I've never gotten the original blood sugar pellete think I'm going to need to rub a bank LOL 😆
I really want the blood sugar vault to 🤩
Blood sugar anniversary this month and mystery boxes end of next month. Nice.
Fml I wish some of the lipstick shades were sold separately😭😭 I can't afford the full vault with being in and out of the hospital every week and trying to move 😭😭

Love it all!!!!!!
OMG! A dentist's palette! ❤️❤️❤️
Eeeek. I actually love the natural nails for once.  Ha. First time ever. Love the mini and new shade.  Yaaaaaaaas
Those joggers are perfect for girls on their periods
Is the conspiracy palette being on sale a sign here?
My makeup brand launches in one week and I hope it makes me a millionaire like jeffree
I adore that the hair looks shiny! It feels like I'm looking at latex and it just matches the whole aesthetic of the palettes.
I love the blood sugar pallette!! It was my first buy from jsc and got me addicted!! I'm def gonna be getting this collection. Cant wait to see what bundles he has
I am excited for the highlighter/blush palette too😍😍
I'm never gonna be out of debt or not broke again! I live for this
Jeffree has the best palette styles in the business, hands down. The formula being as amazing as it is just adds the cherry to the sundae. He can't be beat in terms of quality. I will always be a fan. I need that mini and those highlighters!
lips, luv cavity and sweet tooth, luv me purply pink shades!!!!!!
Omg the new pallet 😍😍
When he said cheek products I thought omg blushes that would of been perfect for this blood sugar collection but he always kills it with packaging ❤🙌
Will NICHE BEAUTY in Canada (Edmonton), be selling any of the launch??!! 🏥 🩸 💖 #imdead #bloodsugar #please #jsc #jeffreestar
Em, in the middle row of the lipsticks, is there a change in color? They alllll loook the saaaaaame!

As I watch and enjoy my elf I still dream of one day owning some of your makeup 💄and I'm glad I don't like the colors on this lip pallet. I just can't do kiss off lips. But the eye shades are gorgeous.
Love that tracksuit
Now that is the Vault i have been waiting for, you can keep your neutrals hunny, give me vampiric, slutty and mysterious reds pinks and purple's  any day.  This is a collection i live and breathe for, Jeffree Send one my Way!
The lonely doll....iykyk
So there is only 1 new shade in the mini? Maybe sale it as a single I don't know if I want to pay half the price for same shades I already own but 1 now the highlighter palette yes
Loveeee blood sugar how has been 3 years already? She’s a staple in my SFX makeup! Def need to pick up another one. I want alllll those reds in the lip vault ❤️ But why don’t you do single regular sizes anymore? :(
VHS container 😅 VCR was used to play the VHS 😂❤️ I love you Jeffree 🥰
Who told Jeffree he should start putting his face on his palettes? Ummmm the crazy creative thing he was known for was not smacking his face on a palette 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
ALL MY FAVE SHADES 🤪🤪🤪🤪
do a pastel one :(
I really love the liquid lipsticks, I wish they would come out as singles.
I need those first five lipsticks in full size 😍😍😍💄💄💄
I just bought the Blood Sugar... but omg you should make that middle shade a single just like you did with Put It Back!!! 😭❤️
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Im living with the male model with jefreeeeeee in the palette! he is so stunning & handsome omygaadddd i cant!!! Full name please??
I wanted the nude vault so bad and could never afford it. Now I want this one and will never afford it. One day.
Blood Sugar has been my absolute favorite palette since it launched! I own and love every single JSC palette and there’s just something special about Blood Sugar! I am definitely getting every piece of this collection! 💖💖
I’m LIVING for this collection !! Been waiting since you first launched Blood Sugar for her to have her own moment !! Like YESS JEFFREE BBY YOU KILLED IT !! 🤤❤️😍👅
تكلمي عربي
Bite My Tongue and Misery are my DREAM reds I’m obsessed I can’t wait 😩🥰
Totally hope you can do the two dark lipsticks in regular size soon, I am a total sucker for dark shades!
This collection for the blood sugar I must get. U want the vault
the vault for 160 dollars - oop no thank you momma
It comes out 2 days before I get paid 😩
I need those pallettes in my life
Yass queen !!
Ooh I am going to need a full size liquid lipstick in the color Heartbeat! Because that one really made my heart beat!!!! 😍❤😍❤
Love the wig red TIL I’m bead
♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
Give me the hoodie PL S
I need the Cavity Highlighter Pallet and the hoodie!!!
Joggers give me period stain vibes 🤣🤣🤣 u made the safest clothing 😍🤣🤣🤣
Its a shame that his face is on them,also on the other one's like orgy.I liked the sleek look,now it screams drugstore.
Ahhhhh. I’m finally early! Plus congrats on the palette anniversary!
Jeffree! Im LIVING for  “Wisdom”, but will it be available as a single shade, like “put it back!”?   Please say yes! *crosses fingers 🤞🏼  I am DECEASED over that highlighter palette!
That "ombre"  on the mirror needs to be blended more LOL
Ehh was thinking it would be a new pallet..the mini isnt new its just a mini version of a 3 year old pallet
As a dental professional I need this collection!!
Love it! 😍🥰
Up till today i still hvnt gotten that palatte 😭
The blood sugar mirror really do be looking like a polish flag :/
I want him to do the same thing he did with the Shane Dawson mini. He sold that emerald green individually instead of buying a whole new pallet for most of the same shades
Omgg..i want it 😍😍
It's so weird watching w/o nails on Jeffree. But when u buy a ranch the nails go. Lol
I’m getting ALL of it ❤️😍❤️ Totally obsessed!!!!
Super exciting! But when is JSC coming out with an all PINK palette!?
I’m early for once
As always , love everything about JSC! You always find ways to amaze me! ❤️❤️❤️
Shit. I might as well just sign over my check..
the vault is stunning
I wish things would launch 🚀 around the 1st....,
I noticed at the last video itself but Damnnnnnnnn Jeffrey star with short nails is What I live for😍😍😍😍.........ur fingers looks cool☺also love ur Big nails tooo.......those lipsticks are BOOM!!!!
Before 1 million views  👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼
I'm sorry but I've said it once and I'll say it again, and I know I'm not the only one saying it, I don't care what people say about him or what he's done, you can't deny his make up fuckin rocks!!!🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻😍
THIS RELEASES ON MY 21ST BIRTHDAY FEB 26TH !! THAT’S SO LIT ❤️❤️❤️ thank you for my birthday gift Jeffree 💗💗💗
Mild confusion on why you didn’t swatch ouch, but this collection is everything 🤩
So nostalgic❤️🤍❤️
Early withing 10 seconds!
Feels weird without the nails
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to buy a whole pallete for ONE new shade... I have all the other shades in the original pallete..... come on now.  Wisdom is beautiful but you could have bought out an entire new pallete to go along side... Are you running out of ideas jeffree????
Candy joint
Good cosmetic jefre so cute 🤑🤑🤑👄👄👄👄💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💓💓💞💓💓💓💓💞💞💞💞💞💖💖💖💖💖 I love ❤️
your cheekbones look somehow different...filled up and uneven😩😩 cherry look 🍒 red hair! great!
Even through all the controversy Jeffree still has the bigger picture in mind and is still on his grind. I love it that you aren’t letting all these people who are so into drama ruin your career. We love to see it babes❤️
what's up with all these bots in the comments
Jeffree, I love your red wig on this video and it looks hot, I wanna say congratulations on your palette!!
2:16 ummmmm.. did they really contour those "abs"?
On the packaging of the cavity palette, he's literally looking in to the lamp. Im dead. (I work at a dentist as an assistant) Hahaha, love ya
Yes I’m so excited!!!!!!!!! ❤️ 🦷
Technically the tooth should be upside down 😩
All the new products are sooooooo beautiful 🥰😍
I wish it was more luxurious looking
I love EvErYtHiNg!!!
I can't wait!
Blood Sugar is my FAVORITE pallette. I am WEEPING over this anniversary collection.  😭😭😭😭😭
We need wisdom in a single shadow BB 😍
I also love Unicorn blood liquid lip
i love his outfit
Love cheering sounds😃
That mini situation is really disappointing. I was expecting more than just 1 new shade
Sugar spike I need
Si thank you ❤️
Star is a true scorpio keep it feisty honey !!!!!
❤💋❤💋❤💋❤💋❤
Congratulations Miss Lynn, you killed again 💕
I'm watching this video doing my eyeshadow with the Blood Sugar Palette!! One of my favs!! So excited for this!! You always give us high quality products and for great prices!! Love you Jeffree!! xoxo
do you want to know what prick means in scottish slang.
Everything is so pretty but I thought he was releasing a eyeshadow cavity palette 😞 or even a blush palette
Jeffree, u didn’t swatch the tan shade!
Yes!!! Can't wait
Amazing!
If you don’t already own blood sugar I can see this palette working, I can see true fans buying it just as a piece. But it’s the exact same palette I really see this as unoriginal and out of ideas
THIS IS ICONIC
jeffree you didn’t swatch the top right shade on the blood sugar mini
M i s e r y tho.  That dark maroon is GORGEOUS
Looking gorgeous in red but u look best in pink or white😀
Did u use a new foundation?? It's not doing u justice on the corners of ur mouth. Go back to ur OG
Jeffree's You launch on my birthday thank yooooouuuuuu❤💜❤💜❤💜
Yasss ❤️🔥🔥
Is the Camera quality increasing or jeffrees skin extremely aging ? 3:35 Or is Jeffree Skin worse than kylie cosmetics?
I hope you’re not wearing your brands upcoming foundation.. ive never seen you so creased
Absolutely love Pink house
woooow! I love it
Saw this and decided to take my lunch break🤣
Next Pallet for JSC- The Shade (example below)  • Blood Sugar: “This is what a $52 pallet is supposed to look like. It’s my most sold pallet to date...(whispers) besides conspiracy theory”. • Conspiracy Theory: Now on sale for $30 (Same formula and also an 18 pan pallet)
I am getting everything ❤️❤️💯💯
Work queen yassss🤑💕
Woo-hoo! I love all of those lippies. But misery is where my heart is at😍😍😍😍
I'm LOVING the mini vault....love my nude one...can't wait for this one!
"frozen prick" me when i'm cold thanks for naming a shade after me xo
Jeffree must be running out of money Because this was the most disappointing launch ever
I think jeffree is running out of ideas.. not really excited.
Queen queen queen 👑 👑 👑
Love you jeffree🤍
Reds are my favorite ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You have beautiful hands, cute even without the long nails.  Congratulations!
🩸😍❤️DEFINITELY GETTING ALL THE PALETTES❤️😍🩸
Hell yeah! So excited to play with that highlighter 🖤 Thanks for offering us so many amazing products! Your brand actually made me excited about make up and now I love it so much!
I love candy joint and heart beat liquid lips.
hi
You didn't swatch the 3rd shade...I think it's called "ouch"..? Ohhhh...I love the way the blood sugar palette shades look against the white and omg that hoodie and sweat pants!! 😍😍
❣❣❣❣❣❣❣
Omg love you jeffree the God of makeup
Love the lip colors red rum
Candy Joint and Cherry Soda are stunning. Let's get real it was hard picking a fav but if I had too it would be those two. This whole collection is STUNNING! The highlight palette is EVERYTHING. You killed it yet again. ❤❤
Jeffree must be running out of money Because this was the least exciting launch ever I’m so disappointed
He told that joke twice 😒
Ya veo a rosy haciendo reseña en breve!
flaming hot cheeeeeeto 🥰😍
Wish Calabasas was in the vault.
I all of a sudden want to watch Cherry 2000 again.
Why didn’t this come out on Valentine’s Day?!!! ❤️🦷❤️🦷 This would’ve been perfect! I’m loving the mini!
Why does he have to do this when I have no extra money? 😫 still love it though
Im so happy about the mini it has all the shades I hit pan on. I'm definatly going to be picking one up the highlighter maybe later or not at all
To be clear: A "shade" is any color plus black. None of these are shades—they are colors. As well: A "tint" is any color plus white (pink is a good example), while a "tone" is any color plus grey.
This all looks... kinda cheap...
Hes ALWAYS BUSY wow gorgeous as 3
I wanna buy this palette just for that one new shade😭😭😭
Loooove some of those new liquid lip shades ☺️
Jeffree is beautiful 😍
No one can freaking deny that Jeffree’s packaging is always bomb.  Edit: Holy shit those likes
I love this whole collection. Half of my paycheck will be going to this
Shut up and take my money 💸💸💸💸
😍😍😍😍
Drama or not. I will always buy Jeffree's palettes 😍😍 they are always to die for ❤
There is literally only one thing I would ask in these videos, have the swatch done on a darker skin tone just to see how it would look on my skin tone. But aside from that, this is bomb af
Ok....am I the only  one thats getting Mrs. Doubtfire vibes from this look? "Matchmaker, matchmaker make me match. Find me a find, catch me a catch."
I'm just back from the dentist today. So strange.
First thoughts on Mini, a waste. When wanting a mini, we want ALL NEW SHADES like all the other minis.
I'm getting that vault!
Jeffree Lynn has no brows again omgg :0
Those dark reds are HEAVENLY
His face being the cover of the palettes turn me off. I love his products but I dont want his face as a cover. It feels too self centered and unattractive as well. It turns me off seeing products with owner's faces on top of them *cough Dragun cough* because it cheapens them.
If I order it from India... More then half of my salary will be gone😭😭😭😭😭😭... Never wanted anything more then thissssssss
If someone reads me, please give me the Blood sugar palette, I live in Venezuela and I don't have the opportunity to buy it 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ugh, so excited. Blood sugar is my favorite palette ever. I definitely need the mini palette & the skin frost palette 💕🙌🏻💋
Love it! ❤️
Am I the only one who notice he forgot to swatch 'ouch' shade? Haha
Yea i didnt like this one. Useless and not buying this. You’re becoming lazy Jeffry.
I am LIVING for the maroons!!!
Them last 4 swatched shades though. ❤️💜💓❤️🤎
I’m so excited! Jogger, mirror , Vault , skin frost palette ans mini WILL BE MINE !!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️     Absolutely love this!!! ❤️🤍
The highlight pallet I need 👀 lol let’s be honest I want it all 😅
Wow those lipsticks 😍😍😍🥵🥵
I want that highlighter palette just because of the pink shade!!!
Me coming home after a visit to dentist seeking this video YouTube you stalking me??!!
Omg that middle shade 😍 Dorothy's shoes vibes 😜
Love the mini!! I so want it. Blood sugar is a palette I dont have but I may have to just go ahead and get her!
subsnya berkurang
Crazy to see you w/out your nails done...
One thing about he’s gonna be very innovative ❤️
Yaassss!!! ❣️❣️❣️❣️ Can't Wait!!!!

🙌🙌🙌👌👌👌🥰🥰🥰
Is the hair and makeup by jay too or....
The highlight pallet ! 😍
I didn't even finish my old Blood Sugar palette lmao 💉
Does anyone else think that highlighter looks like it emphasises his texture sooooo much
Jeffree VCR was the machine! VHS was the tape 😊😊
@JeffreeStar when will we get the full face from jsc primer foundation mascara and a setting spray so I will only need to buy 1 stop brand for all my makeup 🥰
FUCK!! THIS IS SO FUCKING AMAZING!! I LOVE THIS VIDEO, AND, I LOVE THE WAY THE WEBSITE IS!! Love you, Jeffree!!
Girl stop trying to sell your products when you’re literally canceled
Blood sugar formula was 10000x better then conspiracy formula so let's hope u give us same formula as blood sugar and not conspiracy formula r the orgy r blood lust formula
beautiful 😻
Love this!
love you so much and i’m so happy for you❤️
I want the highlight pallet!!
Should have called it a sugar cube.
OMG THE SKIN FROST PALETTE IS SOOO CUTE AHHHHH
I’m still waiting for the Nude Mini palette...ordered it few months back and still haven’t received the replacement since mine was one of the faulty serial number😢😢😢
Did not swatch the whole mini pallet. Only 8 were.
Forests protection activity would make different :D Love the shadows
Red Hot Jeffree
No one gonna talk about the big vag he’s sitting infront of in the thumbnail?
Omg I need the new liquidlips in fullsize!!!!
this is legit the best birthday present lol Jeffree is really pulling the great birthday presents, last year it was the blood lust palette and now its Cavity :)
Yaaassssss blood sugar my fav JSC palette!  Classic!
All that for 1 new fucking shadow shade
Am I the only one slightly upset with the mini? It's a gorgeous pallette and I love all the colors they picked, but I was hoping for a few more new one not just 1
I want wisdom as a single like yall did put it back as a single because I have the original blood sugar and love it but dont need 8 duplicate shades... I wish it was different than the full size. PLEASE MAKE WISDOM A SINGLE!!!!! But I think ima have to grab the highlighter palette atleast!!

Blood Sugar is my daughter's favorite palette. She collects his palettes. Next is Blue Blood.
🍒 Skipped a swatch?? Missing the 3rd color on top row.... There are only 8 swatches on his palm.. 🍒
"I'm obsessed with prick" never a truer word said lmao

For the first time we all can see that you are above your 40s
Anyone else use The Blood Sugar Pallet For Valentines day ??! 🙋🏽‍♀️🙋🏽‍♀️
Jeffree, you know darn well we cant pick favorites from that liquid lip vault!! They are all to DIE for! Again, never cease to amaze!
The Cavity Palette!!! 🤤💀🤤
When all the shades are his favorite formula he has made lol. Love jeffree so much 🤩😍😁.... I'm obsessed 😂🥰
His wig though.
Ugh all red everything yassssss! I live 🖤
Keep it comin Ms Star....and its close to or right at the 1 yr anniversary of the Iconic Blood Lust pallete as well. If youve upgraded from Choking On Ice highlighter...im deceased.
No hate I love jeffree BUT PLEASE DON'T START PUTTING UR FACE ON EVERYTHING LIKE KYLIE. Am not a fan as a makeup person I don't wanna show my clients a palette with someone booty almost naked. Tbh not a huge fan.
So glad this is happening. I love the white shadow
My dentist: I want it 😁😁
my empty wallet is crying lol
I’m earlyyyy🥰
What about those of us that have the original and just want the new eyeshadow shade? 😩
JEFFREE I WANT A PR BOX PLS 🥰🥰🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺👄👄
Omg my dream lip vault
I watch every reveal like twice, but have zero of his products because I’m poor lol one day. But still enjoy watching!
18:55 mmm Polskie lusterko
😍😍😍😍😍😍
I’m not used to seeing Jeffree without his iconic nails
Blood Sugar is my fav palette you have ever come out with. The red just gets me.
Today is my tutorial on blood sugar LOL 😂 I totally didn’t know you were doing this today love it 😍
I feel like putting yourself on the pallets design is lazy... might just be me
I don’t even get why people still support this man, he has done so much shit ( and still does) but never really even apologized  for one thing but still he is able to launch his stuff without any problems. This world is really fucked up...
10:39 reminds me of nyx pigments..i have glitter goals lipstick in red shade and it reminds me of that but a bit more soft..its cuuute
😱 I Can't wait to order all of this!!!! You had me at skinfrost ❤
As an aspiring Dental Hygienist and JS product collector and lover 🦷 I’m SO stoked for this collection! Much love J♥️🤩

Ughhhh I need this 😫😭
I literally can not wait!
Yes Jeffree! XoXo ❤😘💋⚡
Love love love your art❤❤❤
Love it all
I cannot wait for all this! I could have used the blush for my recent look!
the red highlighter is not it sis
Jeffree, you are fantastic, love you ❤️
I don’t think I’ve ever seen Jeffree without nails lol!
I wish he would have kept the brows.... they looked so good on him.
Make a Jeffrey Star x Redbull palette
"Do we need a mini of blood sugar?" Jeffree, darling, we need a mini of every palette!
Get it sis !!!! ✨
so beautiful..
Those skin frosts 🔥🔥
Omg clicked so fast!!!!! Love you Honey
So the single shade we need that! I dont collect so pointless for virtually a "mini double" 🤦   We WANT SINGLE SHADES!!! 💕
I love them all
I thought his knees were some kinda weird ass lookin big hips in the thumbnail 😂🤦🏼‍♀️
Not a big fan of photos being on all the packaging. I like the outer boxes they come in better. I kind of miss the old vibes of his palettes. I’m starting to get Huda vibes with his face being on all the palettes..  Still love the makeup! I just don’t like the direction he’s been going with his packaging lately.
Me Waiting on Jeffree Skin : 👁️👄👁️
That coral shade in the highlight palette is everything I’ve wanted from you! Bless you! I love using stuff like that as a blush. Getting that for sure.
Still waiting for a RedBull collab.
Yesss!!!!
Boring
JS releasing stuff while cancelled is literally everything 😂
Definitely early but definitely in love 😍💕✨
mirror kinda looks like a bloody tampon 😃😃 cute for the aesthetic ❤️😍🥰💘💓
That “Cherry Soda” lipstick... Ugh! Gorgeous!! All the lipsticks are gorgeous!! ❤️
Such a gorgeous palette. Love all of the shades. Great Palette. 🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️

So excited, blood sugar was my first ever pallet that started my obsession with Jeffree Star Cosmetics!
It’s giving midlife crisis
This is my favorite...this one is my favorite...I love it!
Jeffree, you are precious!!!!!!!!!
bro 10 minutes ago- BRUH
Candy frost tho 😍💗
hi i’m here and i’m so sad he flopped
❤️✨ iconic ✨❤️
Is it possible to buy the new shade as a single? I recall you mentioning there would be a series of single eyeshadow shades... But only the green from the Mini Controversy palette has ever been released as a single shade.
I’ve been wanting Blood Sugar since forever and I’ve been putting off buying it, but now I can’t anymore!! I need the white box palette 😭
IM OBSESSED, cannot wait to buy it all 😭
EWWW
I love uuuuuuuu🥰🥰🥰
Looking forward to getting my hands on that white Blood Sugar pallet & hoodie. When is the mini naked pallet coming bk in stock? I gave mine away to someone who really wanted it but couldn't afford it at the time, so I really want to buy another because I never got to use it.
He definitely does have the best quality eyeshadows hands down
wait he didn't swatch ouch!! BUT GORGEOUS PALETTE!
Christ I’m so fuvking happy I just got my tax returns so i can afford this YES
Oh my God i want this. Thank you for Afterpay lol
Congrats Jeffree !! 3 years is an awesome number & the pallets are amazing ! Love the red look - love the wig !!
Oh no
Am I THE ONLY ONE who thinks it's tacky to put yourself on your packaging? It just....doesn't feel right? I can't explain it but I don't like it lol.
OMG IS LAUNCHING ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!
Lmaooo
Who else forgot about jeffree for like 1 second and came back pleased?
Ahh I need this mini palette ❤️❤️
Those dark red shades are the beautiful, shame I don't have the money to get the whole collection of lipsticks though 🙈
People can talk about the drama... But the products are amazing 🤷🏼‍♀️
Can we just acknowledge the fact he deletes all his negative comments
I don’t do anything with makeup at all but I never miss a release 👁👁
Another iconic eyeshadow palette ♥ Well done, Jeffree !!
Love your makeup..No matter what happen to him..personal or professional. .He always stand up and continu.I don't care what poeple think. .He's inspiaring. .A model of courage. 😍
Was hoping for a big new palette
You mean a VHS unicart not a VCR unicart. VCR were used to plays VHS.
So gorgeous!!!!!!!
Gorgeous
Hello.. mini modern renaissance 😍👍
I think sweet tooth 🦷 would have been better a better name. Like who wants a cavity 🦷?
i clicked so fast-
Hello human people who is  early
That new shade! Live for it.
I wonder why his nails are ... empty... :))
coma put me in a coma, its to die 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm so early omg 😲
Omg that white trunk 👀👏🏼👏🏼
I’m early and I’m not mad at it.  I sent a text to my bf and I said “oh god here we go again😂😳...” complete madness lol. Congrats on the extension of the blood sugar family ❤️🙌🏼
I am loving the red colors in this video.
The cavity palette is so cute and the mini looks lush 😍 💕
I need it all
Wish he came out with a ne walleye with new colors :(
Um u swatched them in wrong position or idk im confused of the shade position and then the swatch..but I wont buy it so I dont care I just like to watch it
Awe..  I placed my order too early... I should have waited for this video
Absolutely love the tie dye hoodie!!!!!
I’m so sad my husband ordered blood sugar, blood lust,the Christmas grinders and the high how are ya hoodie for me for Christmas and I never got them they never came in and my husband emailed Jeffery Stars cosmetics and they emailed him back and practically said oh well not there fault it got shipped out so my husband spent all this money and got nothing to show for it and I’m very unhappy because I love Jeffery and I have always wanted his products but i guess I have to wait for us to save up the money again so sad and hurt
I need the highlighter palette
I'm living for this 😍 all your products are so freaking gorgeous!
Jeffree just saying the word Conspiracy 👀
🍁♥️♥️♥️🍁
Should I say I'm early? Is that what I'm supposed to do here?
Jeffrey looks naked without his nails.
♥️
Hello everyone! I’m never this early so if you see this, have a great day!! ❤️❤️
I just called and made a dentist appointment for next Tuesday 🦷
No nail extensions 😯😯😯
Why didn't you swatch the 3rd shade in the 1st row. It's bothering me!
This is so similar to kylie cosmetics packaging
IM SCREAMING I LOVE THISS JEFFREE WORKK
You didn’t swatch the brown shade :/
Me gusta q sacara la versión mini por q a veces para viaje da miedo llevar tu paleta grande
Only one new shadow?
Hey hun, you didn't swatch the top right color in the mini honey

CONGRATS JEFFREE
The new red looks like the one from Blood Lust.  Wish this mini palette had new shades. This is a little boring. Sorry, this is just my opinion.
Omg!!! Yay love seeing a new video from you!!
The earliest I’ve ever been
I love him but am I the only one who thinks he ran out of ideas? Who needs the same palette (I mean if you already have it) with only one new shade?
Jeffree,blood sugar🥰  Indonesian🇲🇨
Love that wig on him. Red looks so good on him.
Love him or hate him this bad bitch kills makeup!! Love his products and his new phone who this attitude.
My Favorite Pallet!! ❤🥰💋
Meh
I’m ready for my root canal 🦷
So excited. Its all so pretty🥰🥰🥰🥰
Beautiful packaging
I love you jeffree
It’s a dumb name for a pallet.  No one wants cavities.  Blood sugar referenced or not 👎
Can you wish my sister a happy 11th birthday?! She loves you!
🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱
❤️

Omg another collection?! Go off sis💗
I love the period stain realness Jeffree is serving today.
Vampire: I want something from you, lovely Girl: w-what Vampire: nothing much- it's just blood, sugar
Jeffree is probably the only person who can casually release a makeup collection while he's 'cancelled'.
Ohhhh exciting.
I loveeee💖
Yay early people here
Bots, bots everywhere
Hi from a hairy pcos girl who wishes she could beat her face like you,lol
Hiiiii
I'm simple.  I see a Jeffree Star launch video, I click as fast as humanly possible!
Here for it sis
Makeup has always been an inspiration to me. I worry that all of my makeup was lost on Tuesday night when our apartment flooded. Hopefully it all works out, but not only has makeup been inspiring to me, it has also been like therapy and a stress reliever when times get a little challenging. Maybe this will be a new beginning if I'm able to buy this :)
Jeffreestar does th best makeup looks can you pls do more asmr video
I have never been here so early!
Not me sitting here with cavity pain and still wanting this 😂😂
I know this might not mean much, but jeffree I am so damn proud of you and your success! You have come such a long way and I'm so happy you have includes us along the way.❤
That Skin Frost pallette is everything 😍

I want the lip vault 😍   Not really interested in the rest
