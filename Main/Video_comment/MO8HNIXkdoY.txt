7:15 he cut the fucking bike
If the Police Officer went up the other escalator, the criminal would have turned round and run back the same way he came, leaving the cop trying to run down an escalator going up.  No win scenario. Crim played it well. Or was lucky
That "where ya going" from the cop always makes me laugh 😂
Least the first bloke didn't break his ribs 😂
Niko catching a stray 😭
3:10 they rolled so the electrical silent alarms didn’t go off as they were too short
5:10 They probably keep all the worst vapes at the end so either way didn't get away with much.
“I don’t know if I can show that. He’s just been squished” 😂😂😂
Yo will I work for a vape company hit me up and I’ll get your vapes made brotha
at 1:26 the door was plastic i fit doors /windows for a living
Why are you all so concerned about his finances he’s got more money than all of us. Also if you don’t like his videos don’t watch
I literaly almost died from laughing too hard in this video
That vape shop that got robelbed is in boro town, whole tiktok just full of the shop being robbed of vapes 😂
I don't know if they named it terapagos just because of the new gimic but if they are gonna do something with it, i think it should be pure normal and its tera form should change depending on the item its holding, like the plates with Arceus or the memory thing with Silvally,
0:13 he just wanted to quickly test it to make sure he actually wanted it
The employees are right there on the top right 5:20
2:59 the store owner, actually had the money in another safe, the safe that they got into was a decoy safe
Bro looked like he ate the 2 body’s ☠️
Fun fact the vapes one was in Middlesbrough Will Will love that 😭😭😭
These commentators.... ugly inside and out .... dark entity inside
The trolly has madgetsbin them to stop the trolleys being taken out the store.
The cleanest thieve here is will.  Stealing our money with this mid content
Will I would have run away too in Newcastle, some dogy smackheads on northumberland street
I swear 3:40 is Serbia, like, Lav and Jelen. Of course mans gonna try amd steal cheap ass beer
That vape clip reminded me of a buddy who did the same thing before vapes were existent. They had display of the different chewing tobacco when he was 16. Kid from our highschool chased him a block caught up with him so Jeff picked him up and body slammed him into the concrete threw some chew pucks at him and ran off.. Jeff died of sucidie 10 years latter
WE WANT LOVE ISLAND
Hello there mate

BRING BACK THE AIRPORT VIDEOS !!!
So. When are we getting will and James watch love island 2023?
you know it’s fucking sad when the best criminal is a fucking two year old
4:43 you gotta love Czech cops 🤣
10:22 This dude actually got fired from his job for recovery of stock because he left the premises to persue a 'shopper' Like what a load of bull, this is why its so accepted to nick from shops
at 7:09 is that surrey quays or am i buging
Ring doorbell one is obvious fake.
Willne describing a garage
The reason they were rolling on the floor was so they didn’t set off motion sensors
I’m a misunderstood moron personally
RIGHT, hello And welcome to my new reacts video because i need money for the bigger more interesting videos. (Comment for the algorithm) also looking forward for the next big (challenge) vid!
Please hurry up and make a vape company. Also can we get YMS3 merchandise while you're at it?
5:04 is that Kon? That looks like Kon.
I mean vaping is bad but so is crypto scams. Soo you do you
love island series coming soon ?????????????????
It's always nice to see Mikey
3 uploads in a week? Didn’t know it was December already Will!
Don't vape!
Willne reacts>>>> Sdmn reacts 🤩
Some people ripped an ATM out of the co-op near me a few years ago...clean out and away it worked perfectly
Will love island just stared so when will and James watch love island
I love these Robbers getting a dose of Karma
He’s just trying to get money to pay for James being in his love island videos
will you are a criminal
will and jim watch love island surely has to comeback
Moron or genius …. ‘Double glaze glass door’ nope will it was plastic love 😂🤦🏽‍♀️ bloody love that he knew before uploading tho
They’re rolling on the floor not to trip the burglar alarms
Got handcuffs on your jaw
Can we get the full story of Mia's phone? 😂
Clearly someone's never robbed an art gallery. What's more suspicious, someone calmly walking out with a painting, or someone running for their lives?
No way the clip with the guy running away with a phone and the door locked is where I live it's in dewsbury west Yorkshire, the guy was let go wasn't arrested and the shop he tried to steal from put out on Their fb page saying if anyone in these hard times needs help all anyone has to do is ask.
Ffs will, can you atleast TRY? Or tell us if theres a big video coming so we know you might actually need the money
The cop reaction from the thumb nail is when he walked into the gas station seeing Asian Andy dressed in only a American speedo paying at the store clerk, Was a great live streaming moment.
The 2nd last guy was a rapist
👌🏿🔥
The thieves who were rolling were doing that to not set off the motion security system. Since they knew the model of safe and how to drill into it, they probably had inside information. Considering they successfully robbed the place, them rolling on the floor absolutely worked. Definitely a genius move and the owner is capping by trying to call them stupid.
That bike is worth $8000 Canadian
They rolled because they misunderstood the angle of the camera and thought they'd be hidden by the counter/tables
This... Was a video😂 take the money and post main channel soon please❤
Only a jordy would say "there good thieves"
The reason people don’t intervene with the thug bike thief’s is because they’d get into more trouble than them. The UK policing system is a joke, should be allowed to grab them and use the angle grinder to remove some digits.
Bro said I hope he murders someone wtf 😂 6:06
Will and James watch Love Island please!!
Wills recycling old videos. He’s done this exact video before
4:53 no joke thats in my town and theres a dedicated tiktok page with videos of people stealing vapes from there lol
will need to be skint more often tbh loving the daily uploads
Can we change the title of these video to “look how gullible WillNE is”?? It is annoying how stupid Will is wen it comes to recognising what is real or fake. Will, are you dumb bro?
at 6:40 that's called a garage its a place where you put a car
"we've got the bud light, cause we're not homophobic" 😂😂
when ur dads in the video
Will get the love island reaction with James back
People used to break into my primary school all the time for some reason and one time they tried to kick in the door and their shoe got stuck 😭
Where are the love island reactions. 2 episodes in already
At least his opinion about convertibles is completely perfect
Must be a good main channel video coming soon. Three videos almost back to back. He needs the money
Daily slop
“How the hell did they get in the safe? That’s smart, they’re good thieves”
can't wait for main channel vid funded by the add reveniew on these videos
I worked in an arcade and can confirm I would take any opportunity to chase someone because its more fun than not chasing someone. One time I caught a guy and didn't know what to do so I just said "guess you know you're banned?" And then walked back as slowly as possible
In America it’s way worse to try to stop a shoplifter. Just let them steal or you’ll probably get sued
you should have reacted to the one in dagenham, they robbed a pharmacy and then decided to do a getaway on a mobility scooter....
this is will's attempt at funding the purchase of a submarine
I was just wondering where this fella has gone, there he is!
3:13 IS GUY FROM SERBIA OMGGG 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤣🤣
Not agreeing with lgbt does not not mean I don’t think they should live, and boycotting budlight does not mean I want homosexuals un alived, I just don’t agree with their pseudo reality and don’t want it to be spread around
Love your videos
the 2 guys roling on the floor look like Simon and maybe Harry 😅
Will i gotta say finally a react channel that has the good clips and not the dogshit repeat ones.
*Will watches a video about criminals*  Also will: I thought that was his car 😭😭😭
*Kids scared he’s gonna get shot for accidentally swatting himself* Will- there’s definitely dead bodies in his room 😂
Lovely video will      Just kidding twat bring back eboys
The 4th one he saw a statue and thought it was a guard 🤣🤣
