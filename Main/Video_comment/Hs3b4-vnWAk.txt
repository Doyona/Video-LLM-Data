The they said free refills tho
I sometimes put the iPad in my room when I’m on the toilet
He forgot the opening of a can of coke
I did a similar cheat sheet in college (an accounting class). The professor was so mad! He said, "I said you could have one sheet but that's not what I meant".  I didn't feel bad about it because I had asked him about an internship earlier and he said "That's only for the best students". I just stared at him. My GPA was good. Thats when I knew PROFESSOR ROWE didn't like me very much. I quickly changed my major. Take that professor Rowe!
"When they look at the blue side they see the red pen, whe  they look at the red side they see the blue pen."  Me pov: HUHHH????? BLUE SIDE CAN SEE RED PEN????
The greenland thing is denmark btw
Should've just studied at this point
What kind of fucked up country makes little kids wear facemasks to school?
When they look through the *blue* side they can see the *red* pen When they look through the *red* side they can see the *blue* pen  Me: *how?*
Nice work mate 👍
nah but why this bro has cheese as his go to snack
TAKISS
It red to red and blue to blue 🙄🤯
genius man on earth
That cheat sheet was genius
Back in the day, a student would use a photocopier to reduce several pages of  notes then arrange it so that it would fit on a single page.
Imagine trying not to get caught cheating with the first one
the 2th one is stley
but who owns Greenland
This might be a ripoff of someone else's video since I saw all of these in this exact order the other day, either that or this is the same person
Cringe
𝓗𝓮𝓱𝓮𝓱𝓮𝓱
𝓑𝓮𝓽 𝓽𝓱𝓲𝓼 𝓲𝓼 𝓬𝓸𝓸𝓵
S M A R T 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
The last kid is a master of semantics. Gonna be a lawyer, that one. 😅
that paint one is just plain stupid and would look like crap
I hate this
Genius Lmao
"When they look to the blue side they see the red pen- Hol' up somethin' ain't right
When u look through the blue you see the blue not the red XD
than his mom beat him
That last one reminds me of my childhood, eating milkshakes on the linoleum edge to the living room. We couldn't eat over the carpet for fear of spills. No tablet, but it's not like you're going to haul the TV into the dining room.
I did the cheese thing but nice, but with a cookie….
Yo little homie was smart with the tablet/kitchen one lol
I love how the teacher actually marked "not greenland" right.
The last kid "beat the system" but got beat for doing so
Who say kids was dumb!
He gets a cheat sheet
Bruh who just eats cheese by itself
That first one, got my dyslexia fucked up
+1 is bad trust me
No that’s nasty who the fuck eats cheese out of the lip balm container 🤢🤮
NOTHING GENIUS  here just scammers and liars now and future.  stupid video. get a job bud this sucks
blue side for red side for red, thats bs
The kid had light mode on 😂 😂
You are a dope a bullshitter and a liar.
no that answer is actually wrong, the question asked for a country and "not Greenland" is recognized by no countries
The teacher: Why are you wearing 3D glasses to class?
That sample wall kinda looks good 😂😂
Greenland is its own country now
Legend has it, the kid with the blue/red notes still failed the test. Ha!
Smart cheese put who just eats cheese
The same thing has beed Done by Indian Great Mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan FRS of two colour writting
Me and my siblings did the last one EVERYDAY
Bro yall able to bring cheat sheets to test?
mad tonka
Bro how does he have permission to have a cheat sheet
TIMMY SPIT THAT OUT GLUE ISN'T EDIBLE
For my college finals I had the same teacher for 3 different  subjects who made it mandatory to bring a cheat sheet to class. One legal sized paper, single sided, and it would be counted towards your grade. Luckily, I took a lot of notes in all my classes, so when I went to make the cheat sheet I had everything I could ever need. Most people were trying to write as small as the could or typing it in say size 9 font, though most of them said they were having a hard time reading even that. I am blessed with some serious near-sightedness, so I typed up all my notes onto the paper, smallest size the program had. I even colour coded per unit, and then colour coded specific lines to do with a topic (ie world religions class- Judaism was surrounded by blue, but then "major God/gods" would be listed in red, important dates in green, and pillars of said religion in purple. Same would happen for all other religions studied). Exam came around and I got the exam perfect, and when I got the grading back she joked and said she had to use a magnifying glass to read my cheat sheet, but said it was the best one she'd ever seen
Blue light shines in n red and red shines in blue but he said it the other way around lol
Denmark for anyone who doesn't know who owns Greenland
so they're just going to allow you to bring 3d glasses to class?
1 PAGE CHEAT SHEET?? LIKE WTFDD
the cheese balm kid is a hero.
technically greenland does own greenland it is a country thats how they work it is just a part of the danish kingdom
The last one
I guess we're allowed to bring 3d glasses into a test now
Don't have 3D glasses?  Here's a life hack: paper has two sides😲
I've seen the kid in the living room and kitchen so many times now its getting annoying
No kids are suppose to eat in class.
If only I was allowed to cheat on test. I was giving F when they found out
I think he’s eating Takis
bro why the 3d glasses? just write on the back of the paper
About the cheat sheet, write it on a möbius strip..
ONLY was aloud to have 1 cheat sheet he was lucky to even get a cheat sheet
Allowed to cheat
all fake shit. Nob
This is stupid. A genius would know the capital of Greenland and a genius wouldn't need a sheet sheet...
It's Denmark
it was a glue stick btw
They could just put wallpapers on then
i bet that was for science olympiad
*FINALLY* someone actually says the red side and blue side correctly!
Wait what about his room for the last one
No one gonna talk about the kid eating chapstick flavored cheese
"This student was only allowed to have one sheet cheat sheet " In my school were they don't allow anything except a pen : WTF
How do u see the red color looking at the blue glasses and seeing the blue color looking at the red glasses
the guy who replaced glue with cheese probably got the idea from 5 minute crafts lmao
Switzerland owns greenland(pls don't woosh me)
Mike                                                                                                                                                                                        Cox
What kind of school would ask their students to cheat? That's just....  I want in..
The amount of effort we went through to pass tests that didn’t matter
The last one was 100000000IQ
Ew… warm sweaty.. cheese… in a tube of chapstick with probably more chapstick stuck on the side
Here's a good way to beat the system leave  poop skid Mark's on the  toilet seat
Bro look through the red see the red writing look through the blue se the blue writing!👀🔴👀🔴👀🔵👀🔵
"not greenland"  *angry danish noises*
That's not how light works
The second one isnt really beating the system
Relax your eyes dud
the 3D glasses, the color red shows the red writing and the blue shows the blue writing on the paper, its not red will show blue and blue will show red
I can't decide if cheese lip balm is cursed or genius
They didn’t beat the system. They worked within it.
Why didn't he use the back of the page
Denmark own greenland
Let me tell you something, if you get caught with cheat sheets in romania, you are fked for the whole year
No… look red = red look blue = blue
Thank you Davidjustinn for actually saying what happens on the 3D glasses. I see Youtubers say through red lens you see red pen, blue lens, blue pen. Luckily you actually said what it is.
The first picture is not genius. He's just an asshole
I replaced a desk chair's arm rest when it broke with a TV wall mount brace successfully and my parents yelled at me. A kid put cheese in a chapstick bottle and is deemed a genius.
Wait overwriting shouldn't work
As a teacher, I wouldn’t have a problem at all with the cheese lip balm. The only time I ever keep students from eating in class is when they make it a distraction by sharing it with each other instead of paying attention. This would likely not happen with the lip balm.
The last one is epic
Why cheese
Your boreing
You still do those
If the student can only have one sheet how come he said red on one and blue on another?
The food and tabet kid could have been comfy if he'd beaten the system a little bit harder
you've got it wrong
HAHAHAHAHAHA! Amazing 🤩 but not true though is itv
Difficult math problem... Me: Not infinity. Professor: A+
Dude, the red side lets you see the red part and vise versa, you got it backwards
These are stupid, and wouldn't work. I'm down thumbing this video.
On that last one, it can be beaten by the parents just saying “no eating on the floor” or “no eating while on devices”
denmark
Last kid beat the system and got beat by his mom after
That cheat sheet is next level
Yes use red side to see blue side
What fuckin system
A bonus question in HS Biology was "what is your blood type"? I basically answered "Idk I think it's B" and got credit lmao
I see the word " genius" has changed its meaning!
Yeah these have been told about 20 times already from what I have seen. Get new material guys. Seriously
Yo I really thought of doing the colored cheat sheet thing a few years ago but was too lazy to write that much to need it anyway. I instead wrote a program to convert text into my handwriting for printing
What the people who did that to the apartment didn’t know is the land lord is not living in it they are they have to live with that eyesore of a wall
"only one "??💀💀didn't even know this stuff existed
Wtf is a cheat sheet
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don’t get how Americans get to have cheat papers during exams
Whats che che
what the hell is a cheat sheet?
Stop speaking into a small microphone you douchebag
All that work they should have just studied.
Ya so true you are allowed to have a fucking cheat sheet so believeable
order a free water and fill the cup with any soda you want.  that's what the get for making us fill our own drinks
ok but like the last kid... now that's smart on another level
Yeah I’m my school no 3d glasses
I once did a test in Biology asking me to specify types of "sponges" and i just said Spongebob and i got it correct lol.
Greenland is actually owned by Denmark
Why does this guy look like he's on the verge of tears for the entire video?
Covered the wall with paint strips? Ever heard of wall paper?
Man whyyy
Denmark owns green land
The first photo is clickbait. Thats a photo of someone taking advantage of the bring your own slurpee cup day before they had proper regulations on it.
sience
If I was that kids mom I wouldn't even be mad lol
The one page cheat sheet would be 1 page regardless of pen color. Hello!
Do you know how expensive the paint strips are. Would have been cheeper to paint the walls and taken the fine
My dad's landlord was a real asshole so before he moved out he and his roommates painted the whole interior flat black, then they took the light bulbs. He said it was so dark in there he couldn't see his hand right in front of his face, lol.
You guys are allowed cheat sheets in tests??? And they say they have a bad education system
When you look through the blue you can see the red ink and when you look through the red you can see the blue ink? What!?😵‍💫
Your telling me non of that pen smudged?
The thing USA things is that Denmark own Greenland fun thing we dont, Greenland own Greenland, they are just part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and are in need of the money we can give them to survive. Other than that they are idependent. They are a part of out democrasy but they can vote to get out of itl Thats the reason why when people asks to buy greenland we cant, its not up to us, its pretty much up to the inhabitants of Greenland if they want to get away from Denmark or not.
Simple , know the rule and play by the rule 😆
That kid is going to end up paying taxes in 2 states....
Imagine the test if the notes were that lengthy...
Him: "If you look the blue side you can the *RED* side and if you look the red side you can see the *BLUE* side." ME: "WOW EXPLANATION!"
I aint tryna eat that much cheese
The kid really beated
"Not Greenland" -Smart Kid
That chat sheet, though
You can she the red pen looking through the blue part?
Funny
Denmark owns greenland but greenland have their own control of their place
I did that too
That teacher is a legend 🤩😎
landlords have every right to deny their tenants wanting to paint the walls
Riririri
Last one my god
how many people want to eat CHESE in school
Ummm… the teacher beat the system not the student with the cheat sheet. The student just fell for the most classic study technique in the book.
Well the Greenland one is not kid beating the system Its just the kid being dumb and the teacher giving points for it being fun
These people geniuses!
How fat do you gotta be to have to sneak in a lip balm container amount of cheese.
Stupid
The teacher who marked it right is an absolute chad
Green land us a part of denmark:)
That paint strip idea is perfect for my room rn actually, I can use blue shades
Love the last
Ummm blue ontop of red wouldn't be seen by either.
That kid is going places
Who the HELL'S MOM wouldn't  allow  food in the LIVINGROOM?!?!?!?
They lit 🤣🤣
I wouldn't classify any of this as genius
Who people actually not know the country owns Greenland is its obviously norway
Why was it the opposite lol
Bruh American students are so lucky why in my School there is so many rules I can't even bring a watch to school
What school allows students to even have a cheat sheet?
Why cheese
And why was he allowed to use a 3D glass
ali
Denmark owns
They understood the assignment lol
This videos is copied from spanish!!!
I'm from greenland
the last kid
Denmark own Greenland
technically, all glasses are 3d glasses
WTF
The land that owns greenland is denmark,
When they see through the red side they can see the blue side and when they see the blue side they can see the red side🤨
That last one is just amazing
No the teacher only gave him half credit idiot
Plot twist :-nothing cames in exam that was written in the cheat sheet
The cheese glue stick probably happened in Wisconsin
Red cant pass through cyan filter  dum
Content like this kills my brain
:o
Did you copy Luke Davidson or did he copy you cause he did the same thing as you did
The country owns Greenland is America
"I'm sorry but you aren't allowed to paint the walls here"  "Darn. What about gluing literally hundreds of pieces of garbage to them?"  "I'm sorry you felt you even had to ask. Of course you can do that! Don't know why you'd want to when wall paper has been around for over 200 years. But be my guest!"
that boy is a genius 🗿
And then his mom beat the shit outta him
The country that owns Green land is denmark🇩🇰🇬🇱
Only 1 page of cheat sheet allowed. No 3D glasses allowed
Ya'all  were allowed to have cheetsheats? I am from Europe and my teachers would say ,,whell, you should have studied" It is all in fun wverybody lol, I have really sweet teachers. 😊
Last kid is a classic snack kid he got the Takis lol
It’s actually blue to see red and red to see blue
Not Greenland like bro
It’s Denmark
I love how he said “they” instead of just assuming if if they were a boy or girl
My kids do the last one.
Denmark
Disgusting
the student should have just used the mobius strip cheat sheet
denmark 4 life
Is that kid eating Talkies?????
Hey I did the 3d trick
Is this the "banana bread at work" guy? Hell yeah.
Funny how your stupid enough to believe this shit
Him:when he used the red one and he can see the blue one and when he used blue he can see the  red one Me:commonsence
It’d been easier to just learn the material instead of making that red and blue notecard
GREENLAND IS DENMARK
“Not Greenland” is no country I have ever heard of. Do they speak English in “Not Greenland”? ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER. DO YOU SPEAK IT??
Is no one gonna same something about the fact he said blue to see red but red to see blue, o think meant to say red to see red blue to see blue
Last time it was a she that brought a cheese stick 😐
I think you should stop copying Luke Davidson
Never happened
You guys can wear 3D glasses during exams?
Then another with purple then green then yellow and he bring multiple divert shaded glasses
Ok dude, stop with the annoying annunciation of words. You didn't do it before.
The..the..the cheese? Just at that point is it worth it
Jesus loves you!!!!
Only one of these was genius jus saying
imagine if he forgot the 3D glasses lol
For the first one, just use the front and back side no need to do red and blue type stuff
Who doesn’t do the last one???
The Last one beat the system for real
No food in the living room no iPad in the kitchen
If u look at the tablet you'll see that it's actually pokemon
Greenland is owned by denmark. Its easy, on some maps it says greenland (denmark)
Lol that that little boy one!!!
Why wouldn’t they let someone paint the walls…they pay rent so they should get to make their home better.
Mannnn I alr no that the cheese it obvious
He just ate cheese
They let people wear 3d glasses during test?
I am wondering how the student is smart to do this, but not to remember some of it.
HE WAS EATING TAKI'S, YEAAAA
Subscribe
W teacher
What am I missing? What did it matter what color pen is used? And why would he need glasses to read it? I don't get it.
I don't think the child who filled his lip balm with cheese was a genius. It shows ingenuity, sure, but that miniscule amount of cheese must have been so disgustingly warm and sweaty by the time he decided to sneak it.
Is it me or people keep saying the same content
I think bro doesnt know colours
Imagine getting caught eating cheese out of a tube lmao
If you look through the blue you can see the blue pin If you look through the red you see the red pin like are you stupid
love that youtube has become tiktok, now i can delete TikTok
The kid at the end is definitely my favorite. 😊
You actually beat the system too. By making content of others and say it's your content.
The last one is a meme from 2014 lmao the nostalgia
The last kid:try me bach
I said don't recommend  Why are you still here?!  Help  Mom!  Ahhhhhhhh
The people who didn't paint their walls are gonna have nasty black surprise in a few years if they live anywhere humid 😂
The interesting thing about the cheat sheet.  If you wrote the cheat sheet.  You were able to pick and ask the questions.   Professors. With insight.
Look like ice cream is for the day for this day I could for to get some ice cream today
OMG SO SURPRISING LIKE I CANT FUCKING BELIEVE THIS OH NO SO SCARY SO SURPRISING  IM HAVING A FUCKING HEART ATTACK
In singapore we cant it in class so idk whats wrong with the class thing
the last one lmao
Agreed
The tablet picture unlocked a memory. Growing up my sister and I shared a room.  When my parents moved into a bigger house we were given our own rooms. But we weren't used to it and slept in one another's rooms. One day our parents told us we had to sleep in our own bedrooms. Since our rooms were next to each other we decided we would sleep in the hallway with just our feet in our perspective rooms. My parents thought it was the funniest thing & took a picture of us. Pretty sure my mom still has the  picture somewhere.
lolk
The 1 page cheat sheet doesn't make any sense, just write on the other side
What kid is that desperate for cheese in class?
I did what that kid did when I was younger. I wasn't allowed to bring my iPad into the living room and couldn't bring food outside of the kitchen... there was a carpet seam... so I just laid on the seam!
The paint one would just look tacky
Did no one realise at thhe beginning he said this doo doo
The one page cheat sheet just unlocked core memories lol
Seems the kid who brought the cheese in his lip balm must of been watching groom groom, 5 min crafts, and their stupid hacks!
These are going to be our future lawyers or super criminals.
What system?
These videos are shown rapidly over and over in so many short videos by many you tubers 😒
I just like people just keep coping each others tick tock to make it there own
i live in the country that own greenland
The kid at the end 🤣🤣
What was the guy doing with the sand pit though
That kid deserves an A on every test he ever takes
"you can only bring one page of formula sheet"  Me knowing how to make a Mobius strip, where to buy A0 paper, and have red/blue 3d glasses : I accept your challenge
“Content creators” are just recycling videos done a thousand times
are they really a genius if they need more cheats than anyone else
I literally have the same socks as the kid in the last photo😳
That kid at the end. That pic was taken so long ago. He’s at least 19
Bro can’t you just write the notes on the other side of the paper ?
If i did what that kid did on the last one.i would get my ass beat for disrespect
Are you tat desperate for cheese?
Whats a cheat sheet tf? Im from europe
RIGHT THIS IS A LUKE DAVISON RIP OFF!!!!
Aaand now I know why Trump tried to buy Greenland from Denmark.. at the same time I’m still baffled over how many people in the comment section, actually thinks that Denmark owns Greenland..
Why are you allowed any cheat sheet at all
Writing ✍️ in 2 different Inks and wearing 3D glasses do not work lol
how desperate for food would you be to put cheese in a glue stick 💀💀
when he looks thru the red: 🈹️ when he looks thru the blue: 🈹️
I think the Greenland question was meant to be answered like that as it is not really who owns it (Denmark) but that it is not a country by itself
Do you people have cheat sheet allowed in school in America.
Bro it’s censored what did they kid say
Bro who ate cheese 🧀 In class not smart at all
I was once told by a teacher that if I didn’t write a cheat sheet then I’d fail the test (for some reason even though I didn’t need cheat sheets) so I took a piece of paper, wrote the simplest equation example based on what we were learning at the time (I can’t remember what it was) and said “There’s my cheat sheet”
My mom said no food on living room and my dad said no tablet on the kitchen
Lol the point goes to the last child.
He isn't a genius if he didn't know Denmark owns Greenland
So like..are we sure that's lip balm? Because for some reason it looks more like a glue stick to me..
Get out the video.
Who tf would want to eat straight cheese in class
Basically regular people doing small things
The kid who ate snacks in class was pretty smart but who tf just eats plain cheese like that
1st doesn't work because youll spend too much time squinting
That last on is actually very OP
The paint strips on the walls confuses me
The cheese in lip balm was my cousin 😂
Denmark
Denmark owns Greenland
I’m a teacher, and you better believe I would have given that kid with the cheat sheet 5 extra points for being so creative!
But he could have used other side of the page.
First one is common in Indian students.
But Greenland isn’t owned by anyone but themselves. But Greenland is in a partnership with Denmark . But Denmark doesn’t own them✨
who are these all not genius at all tho, more like “why tho”
Pretty sure if you look throug the blue side you will see the blue pen tho
The kid eating in the doorway is a genius
bullshit you would still see both colors at the same time. the way you hold the mic is gona make me block your page. Can't stand your crap. nobody wants to see your face
I only understand the student not Greece one
Should have used purple for the 3rd
Doesn’t Denmark own Greenland? Or am I mistaken.
Who beat the system, and later on got beated😂😂
They did
Why the hell did the supervisor allow them to carry 3D glasses stupid
That first one is amazing
Bro, why you sound like the "there was no way guy" from family guy?
Anyone saying that the kid with the cheat sheet didn’t even need it never took a class like physics which has a million formulas
This video dropped my IQ
What’s about the 7-Eleven slurpee
OK I would have been soproud of my child
Landlord be like “ok, now take them down. And repaint this wall that you probably screwed up with all this adhesive.”
Bro  Tf is a cheat sheet
The paint strips one sucks it looks so wierd
Actually +1 means you lost a score, lol it's wierd
The 3D glasses hack wouldnt work. You legit can see blue and red pen on your paper. Even if u overlapped it- it wouldnt work. The glasses would still pick up the some of the colors. And if he wrote it down in the colors and overlapped it- itd only work if he cut two red glassed together and then two blue ones. The amount of writing he did his eye would hurt from winking the entire time.
Imagine being so hungry that you fill a chapstick tube with cheese to sneak into class
How da hell
Paint strips?  These “geniuses” never thought of wallpaper?
Hahaha my mom did the thing with that paint strips
Not genius just retarded
Wotsurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrp
The 3d glasses one is actually really dumb
Greenland is owned by Denmark
Danggg
Why cheese out of every food?
God I hate these cringe-ass vids
Cheat sheets are allowed????  Damn 😩😩
The guy in the first pic is a genius, I should do that too
That’s literally what wallpaper is for
Bro is teacher that dumb that aloud 3d glass in class
Wth was that in front of the kid?
Bro who cares
Some effort but still very little
Well that’s just trash, cya later I’m going if this shit.
How is using the paint strips “beating the system?” It looks awful.
Wtf dude?
The last one is so cool
The dude that brought a ladder to get into any place
Something about how he reads... It's like he never learned emotion. I can't pin point it.
Ah yes non entertaining no effort comtent.
nah bc half my class does the blue pen red pen notes sheet🤡😭😭
Fake af
I was allowed a cheat sheet on a notecard and woke the notes in the form of my a question because we couldn't have obvious answers to said questions.
This guy's a simpleton. All he does is make videos of him explaining videos, like I don't have eyes
Nobody gonna talk about how the drinks fountain image didn't make it into the video
Yeah schools casually allow students to wear 3D glasses to exam. Oh wait they don't even allow a sheet but nvm.
It’s Denmark 🇩🇰 , Greenland 🇬🇱!
“When you throw the red side you see the pen but when you look in to the RED SIDE you see the blue
The chap stick one probably took more time than it was worth, just eat before lol
Cheese 🧀😌
1st one the teacher could take the 3d glasses and he cant cheat no more 2nd one just paint the walls bozo
When I was in hs (2000s) we were still allowed to listen to music during tests. So I started voice recording the study guides and burning cds. Track 1= chapter 1 and so on. My friends and I kept it pretty quiet and not super obvious. After grad we told some people and it got found out/banned the next year 😂
The cheese kid won
I had classmates that printed test notes in tiny print and got very strong reading glasses. Very effective, but yes, these were generally the high achieving students who would have gotten an A. I used a minimalist approach and either used the most simple form of a formula for physics or just names, dates and places for history.
Shit video
Two of those were in part two already
It’s all fun and games for the kid at the end until he holds a Cheeto and reaches for his iPad whilst his mum is looking…
Genius?
Stu-
I sometimes do the last one
U guys are allowed cheat sheets in america? 💀
That last one is such a tb to when life wasnt as chaotic as it is now.
The first idea is cool but I’m color blind
Our uni actually knows about that so it is not allowed and they look if the cheat sheet is written in two overlapping colors
After that kid's father said he is now allowed in the house
I did the eating at the edge of kitchen and living room thing as a kid
Denmark owns Greenland btw
That last kid will become a member of society. Probably an annoying one.
just buy wallpaper
How about the kid during the pandemic who changed his profile pic to the loading wheel so as the teacher thought he had technical difficulties as he skipped class.
Anyone notice when he said blue side you can see the red
Have the second couple heard of WALLPAPER??L
In filipino we call that pilosopo
Two colors is rookie numbers
I feel like most americans actually don’t know who owns Greenland lol
That first one legit takes more effort than just studying
The Greenland teacher is a legende
That kid that said not Greenland was a genius
he could of just wrote it on the other side
Kids have it so easy in school nowadays. Allowed to bring a cheat sheet like wtf HAHAHAH
You shouldn’t eat in class anyway
lol u copy luke davidson funny man
The lazy will always do twice as much work without knowing
⚠️⚠️DONT IGNORE THIS⚠️⚠️JESUS IS RETURNING SOON! YOU CAN TURN TO HIM AND BE SAVED! JESUS LOVES YOU, SPREAD THE MESSAGE!!⚠️✝️⚠️
Bruh sneaking in cheese through lip bomb, imagine just seeing someone eating that in class…
Damn that kid smart
does anyone notice that he say when you look at the blue side your supposed to see the blue but he say'd red
You can also do a Mobius Strip so you have only one side that is double the size. Search it up if you don't know what it is
I have a lip balm thing at home rn, i think im gonna fill it will mini eggs or something lol
Damn this would actually be pretty funny but to bad I saw these jokes the day I was FUCKING born.
Probably cuz Greenland is a territory of Denmark..
#1 is not how it works!
You are serving your life’s purpose
Wow you used the same facts multiple times
OK MY AMI NOT ON HERE? lol sorry!
Lol favorite was the living room in the kitchen that was really funny and really smart at the same time
But for the last one I would’ve sat on the side with the carpet
I did the last one so much lol
The last one looks like me when I was younger lmao
Landlord said they could paint the walls. LOL. How could this be forbidden for anybody?
I hate that USA do things like cheat sheets like come on
Imagine walking around with a tube of cheese in your pocket😂
You mean red side= red pen and blue side= blue pen
hell nah that cheese one kinda nasty
Genius people who beat the system: This guy sits and poorly reads CRAP while posting other people's photos.
So you’re telling me 3D glasses in this video, operate unlike any other.  Look through the blue side to read the red ink?   Do you think a blue tinted lens makes anything blue invisible?  And vice versa?  Even if they were by some miracle the exact same shade as the ink, you’d still both sets.  It bothers me how many of these lists, or facts videos contain things which are completely untrue.
Last one is the most impressive.  Something I would have done.
Imagine the teacher just confiscates the 3d glasses
Ok what test needs you to write 2 whole pages full of notes? If you have to write that many notes to memorize then you probably learned nothing in the class.   My math teacher made us write our notes on tony ass cards so we would actually have to remember the material and not just refer to notes.
The fact that you are allowed a cheat sheet in America is just ridiculous
The last one i didn't get it
the paint strip thing was fcking ugly and stupid
Really cheese tho?
Gn
Teacher: please take off those 3D glasses  Student: sorry my vision is blurry  Teacher: proceed to your test sir
*Genious people like me who beat the system* Part 9.
Be honest who else is just scrolling through shorts right now 💖💖💖
Same as luke davinson
Bruh I’m tempted to do the cheat sheet thing now 😂
Why is there and add on a YouTube short. Wtf
why no tablet in the kitchen?
I wanted to hear about the guy filling up the pool with icees lol
Man does not know how 3D glasses work
If your notes are that extensive on one page, you have just studied and cheated yourself out of cheating.
Ohhh TGE kid eaten takis or something else-
Cheese????
For whatever reason Denmark owns Greenland Europe sucking off of the world and they always done
Denmark owns greenland
That student is a genius
Greenland is owned by denmark
That's not how 3D glasses Works what are you stupid
One page of note but says he made one page in red and another in blue. How does that make since?
Haha, will this is cool
Lol
You’re a snitch stop making these videos
CHEESEEEEEEE CHAPSTICK
I DID THE BLUE AND RED INK FOR A CHEMISTRY QUIZ, MY TEACHERS WAS FURIOUS AND I FAILED MY CHEM-FINAL CAUSE THE DUMB BITCH TOOK MY NOTES 🤡
We had the same one page rule, and a kid in my class legit made a möbius strip effectively giving him two pages to write on
😦😦😦😦😦😦😦❤️
Our professor used to allow us to use an index card, for a cheat sheet, so I would take the biggest index cards available. 😂 I got an A.
The last one his mom gon say no eating on the floor💀
The third one sounds like a troom troom video
I can say That my country (Greenland) is owned by Denmark and us, yess it's kind a confusing but we own ourself and Denmark.
bro couldve written on the back
Tablet kid operates with higher intellect
Yep my son wasn't allowed to eat in our front room because we got a new carpet, he sat in the door way so he could watch tv
But why CHEESE
ROBLOX TEAM!!!! its OKEH not to be OKEH (titan cry😭)
I think is Dania how has Greenland
POV you searched up who owns Greenland
Imagine just snacking on chapstick in class
So nobody is going to talk about the psychopath putting cheese into lip balm like bruh just eat a decent breakfast or something
Cheese wtf
What he need is a cheat sheet long like the one from the court in the US
3d glasses don't work like that.
Where's the guy with the swimming pool and slushy machine? I know, click bait.
If you need that much of a cheat sheet ur gonna fail.  All my engineering tests were actually open book.
Cheese? How fat?
The answer to what country owns Greenland 🇬🇱 is Denmark 🇩🇰
It's Denmark. The Not Greenland question, I mean
That last kid is the best one!!!! My kids will not be watching that!!!
Nice but we’re this takis 😏
What do u mean system there is no system u weirdo
The 'not Greenland' one reminded me of a question I got in history. The question was something along the lines of "Can a child explain the current political climate of [my country]?" I answered:"No, because if I can't, a child couldn't either." Not only was it marked correct, my friend gave the same answer. A couple years later, my brother had the same test coming up and I told him to write "No, because if my brother, [my name], can't, a child couldn't either." Sadly, I don't know if it was marked correct but knowing the teacher, I'm hopeful it was
Too easy
It's not a mistake ✨ ITS A MASTERPIECE ✨
Bol
What sort of test allows for cheat sheets? Is this why America is so dumb?
This video made me delete YouTube
What country owns Greenland hmm I know a country owns it…it’s called ‘a country’ I’m right no matter what
You said he landlord wouldn’t allow them to paint yet they did it anyways, what are you saying?
Awesome and amazing
Dude u copy Luke davidson
Fun fact: Denmark owns Greenland. And because Greenland is so large, Denmark is in the top fifteen biggest countries in the world by land size.
I would do the last one but 1, my parents always go threw the kitchen and living room, 2nd, i have a cat and dog
You said if they look in the blue side they see the red pen if they see the red side they see bluepen
Putting paint stripes up isn’t genius it’s just pure stupidity
No
who tf eat a nob of ceese cause i like mines like cut like cheddar cheese
Boooring
He got the colors mixed up with the 3d glasses
Hello everyone....you will see me everywhere
Denmark owns Greenland
I believe none of this besides the last 2
Ayo he's eating takis?
You know no one has done this
The tablet kid is an old one
lol TF
Smart
Lamo is that tali’s for the little kid in the last one
I don't even remember how many times I've done that last one
Dang the first one is actually very smart
CHEESE
The cheese one 🤢
You should add yourself to the list. You've figured out how to make shit content and somehow profit from it
I thought he was only allowed one cheat sheet
The ink one is so clever 🤣
Weird question is the kid eating takis    LAST VID
I love the idea with the paint strips maybe I'll do that in the future
That paint strips house is next level amazing
Senior year we were given a full page (the back cuz the front had stuff on it) to write whatever we wanted to help with the final (excluding like flat out examples). We were even given time in class, so I proceeded to take the whole time period going over each unit and writing any information I would need. People thought it was extreme, but I only missed 1 question on the final sooo lol  Also for anyone planning on doing something like that I would turn the page 90 degrees per unit, so I knew where the material would be and I wouldn’t have to look too hard.
Ha
😱😁🙂
That kid at the end😂
Tom lehrer made the jello shot to get around a no alcoholic beverage ban on naval base!
why is no one talking about the first one with no commentary
Can someone explain to me what is cheat sheet 🤨🤨
Y'all allowed something that calls "Cheat sheet"  what in the non asian world is that
This dude said blue pen twice
The last one got me!... He's a genius despite being a kid... Einstein reincarnated as this kid 😂
That cheese in the lip balm is fucking nasty😂
My young brother thinks he’s beaten the system, I told him to “stay out of my room”(cause every time he’s in my room things go missing), this guy, proceeds to put his body(from the knees up)in my room, stating that “i haven’t set foot in your room” to which I would reply “no, I said to stay out of my room, that includes the rest of ur body as well”
Its kind dumb that  the teacher marked it right bcs imagane this sommone gives me an math question asking shat is 87×98 and i say not 35 so is that right? No it makes no sense like the teacher
They were ALLOWED to have a cheat sheet???
Our teacher asked us:"How did africans get in America? And I said:" By boat"
The red pen and blue pen thing is not very smart because you won’t know where everything is so if there was a test you don’t know where the right subject is
You can not see blue when you look on the red side or red on blue side
The cheese one is nasty
That last one tho like genius!
who tf is allowed to have a cheat in an exam….
The 5 minute crafts one 💀
That Yong kid is going places
The guy with the cheat sheet could’ve just used the other side of the piece of paper
Denmark owns greenland island
Did u see blue wii remote in the last one
The last one could just take all of it to his room
The kid!
They are not genius...you are just dumb
But how did they write the cheat sheet in the first place? How could they see while writing it
What is the music in the background
Ayo 😳
Last one is a timeless classic
A hint is not an answer. It’s something to get you to an answer. But they let it slide prob gave them a laugh.
Not Greenland is Denmark
Ooo for the paper one, use both sides too.
I thought Dustin diamond was dead?
THE CHEESE ONE
Hiding food  in a school item smart
would 3D glasses work ???  😂😂 think not
Never before has a genius existed without a touch of madness
https://youtube.com/shorts/zhvh8UOJMiQ?feature=share .
Blue side red pen red side blue pen
out of every food in the world, he had to put in  *C H E E S E*
e
Children always find the way😂😂😂
Go in your room child they didnt say nothing about bedroom lol
Hiding cheese like, i cant even see it that was cheese or not
Jesus the amount of times of heard this exact information is to many like what the fuck is the point of all this I remember the kid with the tablet and the snacks from years ago if your gonna do something like this at least get new material
Red is blue and blue is red
I have actually done the last one before 😂
The kid who said not green land:we gotta do this more often
that kid didn’t beat system he followed the rules he left the food in the kitchen and the tablet in the living room
The kid in the last one was in the living kitchen
ladies and gentlemen, *we got him*
P1:Oh what’s one plus one  P2:not3 P1:plus one point for you
Actually when you look at the red side you can see the blue pen and if you look at the blue side you can see the red pen
Is copying someone Spider-Man about who it is
The last one has the same energy of " but I'm!not in your room
The last one is what my cousin did
Why does this guy keep saying beat the system when we're not even robots?
Amazing
Denmark I believe owns greenland
The 2nd one was bad just bad.
Future genius people who will later be incarcerated for “white collar” crimes…who write books about how they were enabled by society as children…who are millionaires when they come out, because they live in a state that allows for them to profit in prison from stories about their crime(s), and/or they are recruited by the CIA upon release.
The one u said that is u look the blue side u can see the red pen when u look to the red side u can see the blue side WHATS THE DIFFERENT
I know the first one
Denmark owns greenland
The last one is me every day😂😂😂
I don’t think thats how 3D glasses work lmao
That cheese snack is a whole you tube thing where 20 ish girls act super cutesy for kids and teach them how to be intentional degenerates
I like all of them but, the little kid was the best I could see my grandson doing that. Lol
Im pretty sure the first one wouldn’t work because one color of text had to come after the other, and therefore cover up the first color?
And 3D glasses are allowed in an exam?  he was allowed one Page cheat sheet ...  Yes, very believable...
ayo he said it wrong the first one he said you can see to the red part of the glass and see the blue pin seeing the red pin and the red pin seeing the blue one he is logic for real
The student that did that is really a genius but what did the teacher say when he pulled out a pair of 3D glasses that's mind blowing, and kids have been doing the bringing food in a nother package forever bro like sense the early 2000s brah
The People of Greenland own Greenland. And is a part of the country Denmark.
What system?🤔
Greenland is owned by Denmark
Who the fuck allowed cheat sheet
Who allows a cheat sheet in exam Like on purpose
The last kid was Sigma male
bruh Denmark owns Greenland , I can't be beat in geography
Meanwhile in our engineering exams we are not allowed to carry the calculator lid inside classroom.
What system
LOL look at the caption but when you actually watch the video there's not even the dude holding the bucket of ice cream in the video 🤣
Imgaine writing down the cheat sheet and getting counfused cause you cant the fucking writing cause the other color is overlapping it. But then you probably just wear movie theater glasses but even then
The last one is same as my brother
FNFqe Ae
I was gonna do that
Blue is red and red is blue?
Uh I don't like this
Very fake and illegal and that’s not how pens work
Blue and red on a paper, rea blue 3D glasses? Wtf hahahaha when you understand math but dont understand color annnddddd you did not know that you can write things in the other face of the paper
The parents beat the system with the last one “You’re only allowed to eat at ten dinner table”
School limits students so the teacher giving a mark for it is him/she promoting creative thinking. Btw just dont mind the thing about school limiting students, we all have our opinions
Cool
I’m England you are not aloud to eat in class anyway
Oh no, our system its brokrn
But in the last one what  if his parents said he had to eat at the table🤔🤔🤔
Ok👌🏻
The last one thoo
It wasn’t marked right. It was given 1 point.  There’s a difference
With the kid who put his food in the kitchen and his tablet in the living room if that were me I would just take it all up to my room LMAO
Davidjustinn:If he sees through the blue he could see the red text and if he sees through the red he can see the blue text Me:THE COLORS ARE INVERTED the universe:THIS GUY DEFINES ALL LOGIC
The first one is similar to my class. I ended up writing really tiny with all the information from the school year on it, and didn't use it. I got a 98%  It's my final It was barely useful
Copied Luke david
The kid was that hungry 🥺🥺
I thought if there was a mark on a problem, it is wrong
Denmark owns Greenland
Man this guy copied luke davidson
Too easy
I have heard pple allowed to take calculators in the promised neverland _out of our land_ *BUT NOW CHEAT SHEETS TOO?* _THATS LITERALLY A CHEAT SKILL_
Am I the only one who doesn’t get the first one. I don’t see how that’s cheating the system your just reading notes?
He looked in the red and saw the blue side and looked in the blue side and saw the red pen??
for the anti eating one, in 2020 and still now, id bring a snack like crackers or goldfish and when the teacher wasnt looking, id put like 8 in the filter part
The last one is genius only in summers tho   (lol)😂
So 2 sheets? Not that crazy
at that point, just study..
I think we all had that one kid in our class that ate cheese out of a chapstick tube 😂
3d glases red can see blue and blue can see blue
i once wasnt allowed to go outside because my parents were out and my friend came he couldnt come in i left the door open i stayed inside and he stayed outside and we started playing with cars lo
I know that kid who brought the cheese lip balm stick got their inspo from 5 mins crafts..
That rule is stupid no tablet in the kitchen and no food in the sitting room what a dumb rule
But what teacher let's u bring a cheat sheet
George: that's my glass
The last one was awesome
You're really copying Luke Davidson
Who has an empty lipbalm stick?
A genius person should invent a machine that keeps full grown men from talking as though they're constantly asking a question.
Do American kids need food in lessons that bad they eat it out a lib balm container
who is your teacher? the way you speak very similar among this fun facts content. do you guys read same book how to get rich on YouTube or something
But when I do it I’m called a smartass 💀
Im interested in the beginning with the pool
Shoutouts to the teacher who accepted "Not Greenland"
Probably Greenland as a part of them work
Second one, Denmark owns Greenland!
LOL that kid on the floor was so funny
But it is greenland
Wow
I have saw all of that before
Who the fuck brings a stick of cheese in to school to eat in class
The last one would work BUT my chest would start hurting and I would get so uncomfortable
Out of anything he bought cheese
This is just r/maliciouscompliance
dude i've done that the cheat sheet
Kid wins
Jesus Christ loves you
how does that make sense if he looks through the blue he should see the blue
Sorry I’m from England why do you get a cheer sheet and when do you get to use it?
I babysat my toddler granddaughter. The rule was no eating on the carpet. So we had a picnic on the kitchen floor. Then I get told " she was not a dog, and did not eat on the floor".
The last one I did before
Who wants to eat cheese in class
Denmark owns grenland btw
He saw red with the blue side and blhe with the red side ah yes L O G I C
Denmark
I don't think the teacher would let the student have the 3D glasses tho
YOOOOO 10000 IQ
The cheese in lip balm 🤢
Tbh the paint strips look really good
Bean faces reply on this comment and like too
Mmmm red = blue and blue = red hmm right o think yaas (NO AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH)
What do you called the glass? ( I mean the name off glass that have 2 colors)
Then they didnt use the chest card at all because he couldn't read either color
The amount of time it would’ve taken to do the first one you might as well have just studied
Genius people who beat the system, "puts paint strips all over wall"
how are y'all allowed to bring cheat sheet
These shorts are so entertaining they always make my day better💕
What the heck
Colours wrong way round
The cheese chapstick thing wasn't that.   The Lil girl who did that just did that cause she liked eating cheese.
And now i know the real reason why Americans are bad at geography...
These shorts are so entertaining they always make my day better💕
The last one is a certified hood classic
BIG brain
Yo, if I was the prof of that first class I would deadass ask to see the cheatsheat afterwards not because I was concerned about cheating (if they did that they learned the material) but because its awesome
"so when they look to the blue side they see the red pen and when they look at the red side they see the blue pen" hold up-
So not many people know Denmark owns Greenland?
this guy has the most punchabks face
There was this one time? At band camp?...
That kid at the end is basically my sister
The one with the painting is kinda dumb
Who allows cheat sheet?
Who actually knows who owns Greenland
Your videos are literally trash
Of course the times when you could bring   cheat sheets
Wait if people write cheat sheets they already know the answers 😂
Who allows chest sheet???
sorry but smart students study instead of writing all those shits in the paper.
Welp not sure how I got here but I make great music 🚫🧢 see for ya self 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
Yo if they write it t Then they know whats the answer
Well actually🤓 thats not true
Honestly if I was the guy with the cheat sheet I’d prob not need it since with that much planning I’d prob remember it like the back of my hand
He didn't beat the system because he wasn't using full screen. 🙅‍♂️🥶not drippy.
Wait... you can bring 3d glasses to a test.
These are big brain
Wow as if I can’t understand the pic myself, you have to describe it for me
Which school where allows cheat cards????
That lip balm one is straight up a troom troom skit
I played this song in the background for a concert 3 weeks ago. Mozart at the north pole is so fun to play (clarinet)
The last one is only genius if you have no dog
I actually be doing the last one😂
Cheese lip balm Nope bro
“When they looked through the blue side they saw the red pen and when they looked through the red side they saw the blue pen”… that’s not how it works blue sees blue and red sees red….
‘He was only allowed one cheat sheet’ that’s bullshit you’re not allowed any
What the fuck is a cheat sheet?
Cal
Wait y’all allowed to have a whole page? I get half a note card!
Done the last one alot of times.
Cheese
3D hack only bested by the "lip balm" eating kid 🤣
No one is taking about the chapstick muncher?
So you're saying that when the student looks through the red side he sees the blue side  but when he looks through the blue side he sees the red side🧐😐😑
Why was that kid so desperate to eat like  4 inch long piece of cheese in class
Greenland belongs to Denmark. Whether the drunks wants it or not
The kid wasting straight cheese:
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABT THE WALL DECOR?!? ITS SO CREATIVE AND SO COOLL!!
You're so monotonous.
None of these people are geniuses. Stop throwing that word around.
Yes the blue lence see red red lence see blue
The cheese stick kid just didn't get loved enough.
HOLY FUCK WHAT A FUCKING LAD 🦫
The last one has all of my respect
Why does everyone sound the same in there videos
Who tf is tryin to sneak cheese in class
Bruh how can u look through the red side and see the blue (same the other way round)
Hate this guy my videos are better
whole driveway. She made up this rule because she didn't want to shovel the sidewalk and driveway that she owned even though my car was parked on the street. So the next morning I came outside to leave and there was snow on the sidewalk and driveway. I didn't want to have to shovel all of that because after all my car was parked out on the street. So I walked to the end of the long porch and stepped off onto the grass covered with snow, walked across the yard hopped over a street sidewalk and walked across the street and got into my car and avoided the whole shoveling ordeal because after all I was parked on the street not the driveway. She was mad because I out smarted her.  The paragraph I just wrote connects to the one below this comment so read the comment below then read this behind it.
One time I was living with a lady who owned the house. She took me outside and pointed at the sidewalk that was attached to the porch and said if I seat foot on the sidewalk I would have to shovel all the snow off the sidewalk. Then she pointed to the three car driveway that was attached to the side walk and said if I set foot on that 3 car driveway that would have to shovel snow off of the
Lol that kid i thing was me lol
How to make videos for reprobates should of been the title.
Man forgets the denmark exists
In what world is a chapstick sized amount of cheese worth sneaking anywhere?  And why cheese?
The last one is not a genius 🤣🤣 tho. Just take it in ur fkin room or does the house only have a kitchen and a living room
The colored glasses block the same color ink so you had it backwards. When looking through blue side they would only see red ink
If he looks through the red side won't he see the blue ink coz the red ink will disappear with the red side?
You say beat the system i say no logic loops
I did the last one
Spend time studying ❌ spend time writing down answers in 2 different colors and barley being able to see what they say✅
"they only allow one page cheat sheet" THEY ALLOW CHEAT SHEETS?!?
Could have just said drnmark it would be much easier
Bruh the last one 🤣
Too easy
Smart pure genius
During a spanish class once i hated it so much i lost interest in doing the course, the teacher wouldnt let us use our phones or get distracted but because i was absent most of the time and began showing up, he pretended i didn't exist and i basically gained immunity in the class... i don't know why i got immunity but he absolutely was weak and nobody liked him. That immunity was short lived however as it only lasted a few months. When i returned the next year i was assigned his class again and he immediately kicked me out so i attended french class lmao
That’s nasty. Who needs cheese that much🤢
Just think about the 3D glasses one for a sec…
My teacher probably would’ve told me to take of the 3D glasses
The student could have just wrote on the back🙃
This is not Impressing
Bro I was allowed an index card for a in person essay. I wrote a 5 paragraph essay and made it .5 font. Fit the entire essay on the card. My eyes hurt the entire day after reading and writing it word for word.
Study the DAVID-WYNN: MILLER.
go outside homie
The thumbnail tho…. 😂
Actually Greenland owns Greenland. Denmark doesn’t own it anymore
Where's the thumbnail clip
I have that tab, it's an oldie but a goodie, mine is over a decade old, still works but sadly I can't use YouTube on it anymore because it's too out of date
I’m kinda beating the system enough bc my phone is glitching and when I screen mirror it,the tv won’t glitch
These are honestly not very smart
do you mean if they look through the blue side they will see the blue and if they look through the red side they will see the red side?
Yo
Da fuk is a cheat sheet
Noice 1.5M likes 😊
The student with the 3D glasses and the kid with the food and tablet are brilliant!
Hello all, I must be missing something, and I am hoping someone would be kind enough to help me out. The story about the students only being allowed a one sheet,  cheat sheet, so they wrote in 2 colors and then used 3d glasses... what am I missing? Wouldn't he or she be able to see the same amount of notes regardless?
Eww why cheese
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
When I was told I could only bring 1 sheet of notes into my exams I took a bunch of pages and scanned them into photoshop and shrunk them down small enough that I could still read them and just printed that document out, I ended up with 4 pages and 2 index cards worth of notes on that paper…
Greenland is part of the Danish Kingdom but it's governing themselves. Denmark do not own Greenland.
I guess they never heard of wallpaper before
Who is that desperate to eat cheese?
I wanna know what’s up with the dude with the ice cream 😭😂💀
The apartment one isn't that good because the room looks ugly
What a bunch of bullsh*t
I once wrote “something” in a fill in the blank question. Somehow that was marked right
cherrys can still have a bite
POV u saw this on tick tick
Who the hecc lets their students write a cheat paper.
Luke davidson did the exact same video first, but like, the EXACT one, same music, video content and probably even script
Cool stories n all but why do you look like you’re on the verge of tears
Not really genius at all
imagine doing all that for a fingertips worth of cheese
Why would you sneak cheese to school as a damn snack??
Wow a kid who has he’s iPad in the living room and food in the kitchen so glad you mad a video about that
Tue last one is genius!
Its all fun and games to beat the system until the system beat you back lmao
Nobody owns Greenland
God your annoying
Your copy of Luke Davisdon (not good)
Ur video are wack asf
That student is fkn pathetic, whats even the point of studying anymore? If you want to fit an entire chapter into a sheet of paper that bad, then why don't you just get a fkin Drawing paper roll at Online shop for 4 bucks and start writing your notes there from now on..
Cool stories but......your speech pattern is annoying AF. Lol
Cheese in the chapstick….genius
Lol
Did he say that backwards??
That last kid tho! 😂 I once punished my kid to a chair in the corner of the room and said “don’t leave this chair until I tell you to”. Damned kid dragged the chair all over the house. Had to respect that!
This is the laziest form of content ever. Taking famous stories and telling them without adding anything. Dislike
It’s all fun and games until the mom says you have to eat at the table
One guy from Romania just copyed your contend and translate it to romanian,his name is Vlad Vaida .... is that ok ?
Bro that last kid is my wife's little cousin
When I was a kid we had tall Tupperware glasses that you couldn't see through.  When I didn't  like the food I would finish my drink first then I would act like I was still taking sips but instead I was spitting the unwanted food back into the cup and  then I'd throw it away after my plate was cleared
The cheese 😂
That cheese must be disgusting
https://youtu.be/H8r32LI0qtU dis go crazy
those people were acting lazy so they’re not smart
Cool 😎
You see if my child was like that I wouldn't be mad i be happy that they smart enough to think XD and figure out solutions to a problem them selfs ;3
In college we also had a test where we could only use 1 side of a piece of paper. Some genius decided to not only use an abnormally long piece of paper but they made it into a Möbius strip ie 1 continuous side. Professor was so impressed he let it in
isn't it iceland
blue see red pen and Red see blue pen🤣
Who thought this kid cheese he had wisdom in him
Wow why am I having a Peter Griffin in a homer Simpson and a BART Simpson and Alisa Simpson in the future Rama/fox TV reality shows and Fox TV shows moments like these are the people that created most of our American things and if this is true this is exciting news if it’s not it’s boring
Bro this might be the dumbest shit I've ever seen
The cheese probably was old what if he forget to eat it or the teacher think he’s eating chap stivk
I would have been impressed by the first one if I was a teacher.
If u gotta take that much notes for a test ur doing it wrong.
Why don't u just clip on ur mic instead of holding it like a doofus 😂😂 And why the green screen?
Dude get a proper mic at this point.
What kind of school allows cheat sheets
@ the one with the paint strips: it wasn’t genius. It would be tacky if you wanted to hang photos
who tf eats straight cheese in class?
Who needs toilet paper when you have hands?
Denmark owns Greenland 🇩🇰🇬🇱
I was only allowed a one sided sheet of paper for notes for a college final. So I cut the paper in half and taped the ends to make a long skinny piece of paper. Then I made a Mobius strip by putting a twist and taping the ends.  It was allowed.
I've done something similar to this before in undergrad stats. My professor still talks about it til this day. When I was in grad school he saw me walking down the hall and called me in front of his class to explain what I did. Lol.
That cheat sheet 🤣 lad should've just studied
I want to give you a noble prize for finding these talents 😂
In basic training, this dude named groff got his parents to send him chocolate mousse in shampoo bottles. The drill sergeants were baffled that he wasn't losing weight.
If a student needs that much cheat he should just give up.
This one's my favorite
Rubenete gringo, guatafac jsjjsjs
The paint strip one is just stupid.
Bro but the paint samples are actually beautiful
That kid at the end the Goat 🐐 lol
Way to beat the system at an ice cream parlor place then once they've already scooped out size. Put it on a cone or a bowl for you say on second thought I'll have to they will have to match the first ice cream scoop so they automatically make it bigger
Excuse me uhmm I think in blue glass you could see red and red glass for blue ..
Only one page cheat sheet? ONLY!?! -cries in Irish school system-
Dislike
Bruh
Why don't you just write it on the back of the paper
The people who made the rules were probably like: Damn, you right. 🥲

Wait that kid was ALOUD to make a cheat sheet!?
I like how the paint sample room looks
Paint strips are actually so damn expensive, that they could of just moved out to a new apartment.
I'm destroyed right here
*DISLIKE HERE*
The blue and red pen trick won’t work, because thru the red glass the blue ink will appear black, so the writing in blue will be in the way anyways.
The last one tho…
If your a veteran or pioneer you know that some of these are pretty old
Who just eats warm cheese
Wait correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the purpose of the red side is to see the red pen and the purpose of the blue side is to see the blue pen?. Cus if that's true than he said it the other way around and if he's correct than just ignore what I said.
Guy walks into a frozen yogurt shop with a kids pool..  Employee:  sir, get out
smack my-
We ain’t gon talk about the first picture? Bro really brought a kiddie pool
The cheese one is just fuxking wierd
I love this, i just love rebels man.
What the hell is so genius of all this dumb shit
Allowed to bring a cheat sheet???
Could've picked a better piece
The kid who answered "not Greenland" actually got -1 point so the teacher didn't give him the mark like what the guy in the video said. Instead, the kid added a line to the (-) to make it look like a (+) making him even smarter and big brained that what he was thought of before.
That first one is sheer genius!!!
Who allows 3d glasses during a test?
This has to be the dumbest shit I’ve ever seen
The last one is a classic
I don't understand the red and blue. If he was only allowed 1 page cheat sheet couldn't he have just wrote with a normal pen? Or did he cheat the cheat sheet by having 2 sheets?
I want admission in this school
Why no one is talking about the wall painting.. The results looks really so satisfying 😭✨
He really sensor not Greenland
WOW
How did he see red in the blue side of the glasses and blue in the red side?
Did anyone not notice that he said that when U see in blue u can see the red and when u see in red u can see blue?
WHY cheese?
Wait you're allowed to bring a cheat sheet to an exam somewhere in the world? 😑😑😑😑
In fact who owns greenland is Denmark
The one with the food annoys me, cause there's a good reason why you shouldn't eat in class.
Gotta love these cheat codes
I love the paint strips one!!
Lol not Greenland is actually the term for Iceland which was the correct answer.
They could have put wallpaper up instead
"Nobody said anything about being able to have 3D glasses during the exam."
I call fake (or at least over exaggerated) on the blue pen/red pen one, because I actually did this for a design project once. Turns out you need a very specific shade of cyan to be successfully blocked out by a blue filter, and the one in 3D glasses is not strong enough. Also, good luck  finding a pen or printer that can print almost pure cyan, it's super expensive.
Or just study
For the last one, the kid could just eat somewhere that’s not the kitchen or the living room, like perhaps his bedroom or the basement, unless the only way to get to the kitchen is through the living room.
He sounds like the kid from UP.
The Free Refills guy in the beginning tho 😂
How about writing at the back of the paper?
The cheat sheet thing is pretty cool but doesn't have nothing on me being able to put 10 pages worth of notes on a single sheet of paper just by writing super small. A friend of mine in Highschool would kinda compete with each other who could save the most paper in his notebook. AP Biology was the best man.
Who has a carpet in there kitchen
THAT I IS PERFECT now i can eatign while watch youtooz
You guys get cheat cheats 🧍‍♀️
at the last one, it would be a nightmare if the mom said: “no eating on the  floor.”
They didnt beat the system, they are just smarter than you
I did the Glue stick with star burst once back in 5th grade
That is not how those work
Wtf! You’re allowed a cheat sheet!?!?!?
Hey I know a really good trick you can erase your notes even if you wrote them in like pain you can erase them with ironer
Wait, who is allowed to have a cheat sheet in a test?
https://youtube.com/shorts/1TzEN_3Nv3g?feature=share
No way he beat the system 😱😱👏👏
Epic
Remember when we were all little would come up with smart ways around the rules
That kid at the end was playing with fire
The kid is the maid of ginius😐
Are Americans used to being able to eat in class? In Scotland you get detention as default if you are caught. Nobody is allowed to eat in class here.
I did the first one for my exam and still got a 58 percent 😂
His voice 😬
Cheese 🤢
Sigma rule #14 Authority sucks
I think the +1 means +1 fault
RESPECT
They get a sheet they can use to cheat? 😂
Respekt. Video
I’m really hoping that the red and blue pen idea is 500% accurate. Mind blowing if it is lol 😂
He wrote all that for nothing🤷‍♀️I was allowed a one page cheat sheet front and back. I knew my stuff but just in case I wanted to double check my work, I went ahead and made one. I had 8 pages of notes for the class. All I did was go to a printer and selected booklet print, 4 squares front and back, scan and print, done. Had more time to study than going crossed eyed🥴
Nigga put cheese in the glue stick that’s 🤮🤢🤮
My parents basically can’t do “no electronics in the kitchen” because my dads work computer is in the dining room.
Ok but cheese????
Dude the first one is absolute big brain
Oh no who let this kid watch troom troom
God can you make actual content instead of searching up random shit. Your voice sounds like you are about to shit your pants
Whats the color cards on the wall supposed to mean?
Yooo this video is fire 🔥
The last kid is actually beating the sistem lmao
Yeah but why is no one talking about the cheese one
no one gonna say anything about the free refills one
They arent genius lmao easy🤣✋🏻✋🏻😅😂😐😳😳🙄
Little kid is REALLY SMART. Something my Grandson Aiden Would do. Sharp as a Knife!!
Some of these are Not beating the system, it's them being a smart ass
You and your videos are class-A suck!
the teacher from the first one, wondering why the actual fuck a kid brought 3D glasses to class:
You look like a cross between Zac Morris and Screech 😂😂
I hate to tell you this. But that's not at all how genius works.
If they can stick paint sample why dont stick wallpaper instead 🤥
When kids are taking lessons from 5 minute crafts
Well Greenland kinda owns itself. Denmark just gives them support and has owned it (I’m pretty sure that’s how I is)
The song that is being played in the background was put for us to listen throughout the whole lunch time in my old school and we couldn't talk until the music ended and then 10 minutes later they put it back on.
Cheese supposedly is really unhealthy though people love it, while pomegranates r
If the couple couldn't paint the walls, why didn't they just used wallpaper? Those paint strips are just "being petty", not "beating the system". Hell if they really want to be "1000 iq" just paint the wallpaper.  But amusing nonetheless...
Bruh imagine someone going to home depot to repaint their walls and all the samples are GONE 😭
Greenland is owned by denmark/Danmark
remember the hannah montana ep when jackson did the cheating thing but knew all the material by the end loool
Smart Asses finish 1st... Assholes 2nd...
Red makes blue blue makes red
That child is going places
Fucking stupid lies.
Ooomg that child is genius. I'm going to try hidden cheese lipstick now.
I LITERALLY did the same thing on a notecard for an exam xD such a good method
Yeah when they look through the red lense they see the blue writing & when they see through the blue lense they see the red writing
Man what.
These shorts are so entertaining they they always make my day better 🤯
Not Greenland 🤌🏽🤣🤣
If I was one of those kids i use it to my advantage
How the hell does the teacher not notice the glasses
That kid with his snacks on the Lichtenstein floor is a genius lol
What if everything the student wrote on the cheat sheet wasn't on the tes😥
Both my blue and red pen write in Black ink.
Oh no you did something smart here comes the belt
Part four sounded like "are poor"
the only smart kid was the last one
The last one is great.
How to make a video with very little knowledge
God loves us all and he died on the cross for us all
Who just eats cheese
Tesla’s is here at uwohu
The second one is better then regular paint LETS ALL BE HONEST :)
I mean the wall does look good
kid def turned -1 into +1 elohel
The blue/red why not just write half the notes in small print at top and half in small print on the bottom.
I once had the question of where is the "x" I had alrdy seen the memes. I mark the x and say here and my teacher actually marked it right.
Questions more like what teacher allows their students to have a cheat sheet
Probably that kid has more iq than Einstein      Jk
How fat are you that you can't survive class w/o a chapstick's tube worth of cheese ?!
Why does he talk like that? What the fuck?
Also Denmark owns Greenland
"Not Greenland" damn right 😂😂 kudos to the teacher too
Good video good luck and much love to you 💪❤️
genius no.. sneaky yes
That one page cheat sheet thing he looks so confusing and so messed up and all that stuff they would hurt my eyes look at it and all that stuff I’m one of those kids that have problems were if they look at something for too long their eyes hurt and they had problems with her head no where they have headaches and all that stuff and I used to have seizures but they went away whenever I took medicine for a long time in a lot stuff and I just I still have problems I can’t look at papers like that that looks so so complicated and if I think about stuff that’s really complicated for Long time like nothing about stuff it just makes my head hurt and it just it’s not good sorry that I’m rambling I just realized that that has been hard for some kids
Lol so dumb +1 is how some teachers mark stuff wrong and how does this guy get good views😂😂😂
Bringing cheese to class is not genius
My math teacher put a 10 point bonus question on a test when I was in fourth grade and said (*its not what you think*) so I wrote that down and she gave me the points
That cheese lip balm sounds disgusting
More be amazed rip-offs
Is no one gonna talk about the lip balm cheese?
The red and blue notes is actually really smart
Why cheese?
Like the last is very classic
The kid at the end! ....Epic!
The blue pen red pen thing was actually very clever
Okay but why is the last kid eating takis?
That last one with the kid. I feel like all of us did that. Show yourself, the people who didn't do this.
That was ez
I had a history teacher who, upon seeing someone eating in class, would always ask "Did you bring enough for everyone? Oh, you didnt? Well, that's quite rude to eat in front of all the others without sharing, isn't it? Please get rid of it." This was too good an opportunity to pass up! So there I am, loudly munching candy in class one day, and the inevitable question comes as to whether I brought enough for everyone? "Well, now that you mention it, Mr. Teacher, I have!" So I started passing candy out to all the other students and even put some on the teacher's desk. He just stood there shaking his head trying not to laugh. He never asked that question again after that!
The chapstick tube of cheese. Are you that desperate for cheese?
In case y’all are wondering, Denmark owns Greenland.
That is not how 3D glasses work
The plus 1 is actually marking it wrong trust me I’m in school
These people are also why new ridiculous and extremely strict laws are created everyday. I’ve seen it first hand in the justice system.
Cringe
Someone has been watching 5 minute crafts
No one's gonna talk about the first shot of the guy filling up a kiddie pool with slurpee?!?!  *GENIUS, MAN* !!!!!
My sister  luve you
Who the hell, would bring a lip balm with cheese innit to class??😭
Great video thanks for posting very fun
They aren't people they're gods
I love the kid at the end lol
If the student brought 3D glasses they would be able to see the blue pen through the blue side and the red pen through the red side
Beating the system  When the system is flawed Is called SYSTEM MODIFICATION
Well this all sounds like 100% bullshit.
First kid- Allowed to bring one cheet sheet Me- WHICH SCHOOL DO U STUDY IN KID?! TELL ME RIGHT NOWWWWW!!!!!
That is genius with the 3-d glasses
Well, technically the teacher asked which country. And the answer "not Greenland" isn't a country.
The cheat sheet one happened at my school (Franciscan University of Steubenville)
When I used to write cheet sheets, my handwriting was so small that Noone could read it. Then the teacher thought of bringing a magnifying glass. Still Noone could read it coz i wrote like a doctor. 😂😂   Ah! The good old days of my childhood... 🥲
Wow so cool

In which world are kids allowed to bring in cheat sheets
Kids are smarter then adults give them credit for !!!
That's a lot of ice cream
That one teacher who marked the "not Greenland" student one right is a legend
So genius😍😍😍😍😍😂😂😂😂😭🧔🏻‍♀️🤚🏻❤️❤️❤️❤️😍
I don’t think a cheese glue stick is beating the system my dude
Im tired of people saying greenland is owned by another country no its a agreement between countries imagin a country and it got brothers thats just how it is, it runs it self its not run by denmark
Use me like dislike button
He beat the system and his mom beat the shit out of him
The student with the notes sheet isn’t genius if they needed that many elaborate notes. Just dumb enough to spend more time writing notes then actually studying.
whdddjdahd
Some of these were stupid lol and unnecessary  *takes notes *
The cheese in the lip balm is actually 5 min crafts
The kid is the real one who beat the system
If someone hung up a bunch of paint swatches in my rental they better be taking that shit down too
Okay the paint strip one just looks tacky...
I probably would've gotten a better score than the first kid, literally any of the people who don't study would've lol.
3D glasses are ref and cyan but I guess it looks blue
1000 th comment
I did the red and blue trick for a note card. Made my own 3d "glasses" as well using cyan and red sharpies and tape. It worked.
Cool
This was stuff from 2015
That first one is genius
I still would have screamed at my son for the Last one. " stop being smarter than me " SMACK!!
Your voice is annoying!!! Just talk normal for christ sake!
They can bring a cheat sheet!?
The mom - Food is not allowed in the living room and the tablet is not allowed in the kitchen.   The boy - lies down on the floor in front of the door, thinking he's awesome.  Me - takes food and tablet both to the bedroom
The last kid was 200 IQ
Bruh the chapstick one is fcking genius
this shit is dumb
Where are all this people making this tiktok-ish videos coming from? Lol theyre everywhere on Youtube
DENMARK FUCKKK KAH AGTI UF KVK KCK K
Not gonna talk about that huge pool of slushy at the beginning????
Cheese? Gtfo. Kys
The last 1 was the only w
The fact that they were allowed to bring cheat sheets if i wear them i would bring a whole billboard
lie
thts all a ie
‰
look ‰ <>√π∆¶{}£€¥¢✓™™®©℅‰
That first is me
That kid is so smart
Kids* who beat the system
Lol good stuff
At my school, when a teacher writes 1+ it's out of 4+ and that actually means that not greenland was an awful anwser.  That kid is still genius tho.
They beat the algorithm
He/she could just write the rest at the back of the paper😢
Lol my daughter is like that last kid. When she was around 2 years old. She had an Elmo doll. We were laying next to each other and she kept purposefully touching my phone with her hand while I was reading. I told her not to touch my phone, so she grabs Elmo’s hand and keeps tapping my phone with his hand. When I reminded her not to touch my phone, she said “I’m not, Elmo is”. She was always quite the talker but this revealed that teen years are gonna be fun :)
Why are you wasting your time making these Videos.
Lmao that kid 🤣🤣🤣
The cheat sheet one depends on the class and how much ya had to memorize. I know for my zoology class he was nice enough to allow a little card. Never heard of anyone doing a whole paper tho, that seems like a bit much.
I hope that’s not the actual cheat sheet. Fuck that class that’s too much
tooo funny🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How about you just... study instead of making a elaborate cheat sheet tf
The fact that at the end the kid has takis   in the bowl and just playing on his ipad
I think i have a pretty cool story for this one! There was once this test that i hadn't studied a lot for and to avoid getting caught i brought a cheat sheet written in hieroglyphs (i know how to read and write a bunch of them). I ended up not using it because it turned out to be an easy test but i think it would have been pretty amazing if i did.
We all know the mom of that kid still grounded him even though he technically did what she said
Fact: such teachers are not found in india.

That's what my history teacher did once
The last video is something my son would do lol...
im so tired
Why all.these assholes have the same fcknh voice? Freak me out bro
❤️💯
One time I was told that couldn't     eat in my bed room so I put my tablit in the bed room and I sat down in the hol
That paint strip one is brilliant
Which country*
That kid is going somewhere man
Never understood why food wasn’t allowed in class. How can you deny a hungry child food. That’s not right.
Denmark owns Greenland
Cause when you use blue glasses you can see red and when you use the red glasses you can see blue 😂
Omg😂
Freakyass vatos
our physics teacher allowed us to have open notebooks while taking the test. still, the whole class failed except from the 2 good students.
Want a sneeky cider at work in front of everyone.. empty an originol lucazade bottle of its contemts and fill it with cider...  how will they know... how will they know
Why was he aloud to have a cheat sheet
Out of all the food you could sneak in to class the student picked cheese-
can somebody please explain to me why the boy is allowed to have his tablet in the kitchen. i get the whole no food in the living room but not tablet in the kitchen. please explain.
The first one is fake
What class is this were they get to take a chit
Who remembers when 7-Eleven had a free slurpee day where you could bring in any container and fill it with slurpee for free so people would be absurd and bring like a kiddy pool like the intro shows here that's why they changed it to like a free large or restricted the amount you'd get free
They were all shit
I new a guy who put his dip in his chapstick and could use it in school
Greenland is owned by greenland tho….
I wish my school would allow bringing cheat sheets...
“The student was only allowed one page of notes so he made a page in blue pen and another page in red pen” bruh I thought you said only one page
Okay I'm sorry for the people who actually like this video, but I can't help but feel like it's lazy. Since these kids didn't really beat the system, beating the system would mean like getting out of poverty against the odds, while from what is said none of them beat an oppressive system or actually went against something for what they believe in. Again I'm sorry it's just I get pissed off seeing this type of stuff because who thinks of this type of stuff when someone says beating the system.
That kid is going places 😂🥰
This is what downsyndrome sounds like.
He said he sees the red witb the blue side
You have to laugh at these Muppets holding their mics narrating their dumb clips.
By the way Denmark owns Greenland
Lawyer system part 4 lol
Bro ur just copying be amazed
Whete is the slurpee?
I think he meant the opposite The blue side he could see the blue pen the red side he could see the red pen not the blue said he could see the red pen and the red pen could see the blue stuff
1000 IQ plays
Cheese chapstick lol
The last kid 👏🤣
this genius eatin cheese out of a glue stick
Stop making shit up. Do something productive.
Yea, I heard a story about this kid who was told that he was only allowed to bring in a 3 by 5 note card for notes. They didn't specify units. The man comes in with a 3 foot by 5 foot note card. It is allowed because it was 3 by 5 like the teacher said
Why cheese tho? It’s not even a significant amount.
wow click bait genius
What was the green stick thing when it was the kid part bout no food in living  room?
Yea..why wouldn't u just write really small on one page an then flip it over?? 🤦🏾‍♂️ He's doing too much
The land lord thing. I understand because the colors renters pick are ugly
cheese?
You know for the first one you can just flip the paper over
They could have just used wallpaper
Anyone who watched Chicken Run knows this isn't beating the system.
Use red,green & blue so triple cheat 😅
The cheese one sounds like an old ass 5 minute crafts idea when they where at least someone bearable to watch
The last kid is the definition of smart from childhood 😂👌but he's so adorable 😍
Imagine starving so bad in class that you eat straight up cheese
The cheese stick lmao
The paint sample decor, my favorite. Awesome! ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
Why the fuck do you talk Like a robot?
Fu¢k the sh!tstem!
The cheese chapstick lol thays def a fat kid 😆
Who tf eats a stick of cheese in class
Cheese CHEESE
how to block this channel
Everyone’s done the last one
No just one point
Just use the other side of the sheet smh
He didn’t cheat the system the chief nothing is so you can learn he definitely learned when he had to write that out so small. And figure out how to get it all in. And he isolated what he felt he needed more work remembering. Jokes on him
Stop copying other videos
Stayed home "sick" from school, mom said couldn't have friends in the house, so brought PS2 and tv out to the front porch to play with my friends, when she got home I told her "you said I couldn't have my friends in the house"
The last one is a perfect example of parents giving up and letting their kid win
Ok I need a 3d glasses to see if it works
Oof consider system beat
He should of send usa because its shorter
Who tf eats cheese by itself
If you’re going to make a cheat sheet that intense why wouldn’t you just study
Ahh yes, the famous country, "Not Greenland".
My teachers would give me an F anyway because I worked ,,unprofessional"🙄
Awesome.👍🏻
Wtf is a cheat sheet ? Are students allowed to cheat in exams ?
Why do y’all talk like frikken morons.
And 3d glasses don't work that way
You know how absurd it sounds that they allowed 3d glassed inside exam hall?
The kid is brilliant
Hence proven:all lazy ppl r genius 🙂😂😂 Congrats ur a genius 😇😇
E
Too easy
So now just being mildly intelligent is genius?
We weren’t allowed to have mints in class in middle school. So I would replace the eraser in my mechanical pencils with white tic tacs.
The not Greenland kid failed I get number grades like him a 1 is bad
See the kid eating in the kitchen is big brain if my kid did this id be so happy hes a smartass
Wait wait wait wait you are allowed to fucking cheat on your exams wtf
Bullshit
brub they got a cheat sheet lol so unfair
🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
I used to do the last one all the time 🤫
Why are you doing your hand like that
Hmm wouldnt "people who exploited the system" more fitting
Doesn't Denmark own Greenland
this video should be titled as - genius people who beat the system by doing useless things and nobody cared
I’ve seen the same video clips about 20 times now
Honestly the cheat sheet student doesn’t need to take that assignment he’s already proven he’s smart enough with his genius.
STOP COPYING LUKE DAVIDSON!!!
Okay now I want to write in blue and red.
Stop stealing ppls stuff
Wow
i love your videos for like years..
Okay the one with the kid not allowing food in family room and the tablet's not allowed in the kitchen we did that all the time
Unemployment
The cheese lip bomb 😂🤣
Respect for the teacher for marking It right
Is that tone of voice mandatory for these videos? It's actually making me physically sick 🤢
If that were my son, I would be very proud.
Not genius just obnoxious thanks for that, how do i get a refund on my time spent on that?
YESSSS BIG BRAIN
The paint strips is stupid
Your voice kills my ears
glue stick w cheese? The OG cheese stick
...you know..you could...just...use wallpaper....very genius indeed...
It takes so little to brighten someone else's day. Yet it can leave them feeling happy for a moment, an hour, a day, or give them a sweet memory for life. Help someone in need (esp. the elderly), tell someone you care about they’re amazing, compliment the chef who just made your delicious dinner, post something positive or leave a kind comment on social media, even just smile at people around you... And it will make you feel pretty awesome, too. 🙌.
The word genius is overused. But some good ideas, here.
Guys don reply to people who say this 👀👉_____________________________________________________________________________.............aight 🤫👌
My dyslexia kicked in at the blue red pen thing
When genius is now describing non linear thinking it starts to lose its meaning..
My store charged $10-$20 for Bring Your Own Cup Day to fill a kiddie pool like in the thumbnail.
LOL 😁😀
No most of this is common sense
Naruto Wins😊😁😁
Nah my mom doesn't mind if I bring my phone while eating
am i the only who has never seen those kind of 3d glasses
Can we give that teacher some love
Lmaooo
So this dude just steals old memes then, that’s a pretty sad existence
The first one is a genious
Denmark
wow…good you showed us which is the red and the blue site of the 3d glasses…
Teacher pasted the vibe check
Mom: No electronics in the kitchen and no food in the living room! Kid: uses food in kitchen and tablet in the living room at the same time Mom: No, this isnt how your supposed to play the game
That last kid is so smart if anything I'd give him the record for beating the system better than anyone lol
He said when the person would look through the blue side they’d see the blue pen, and when they looked through the red side they’d see the red pen, but literally it would be the complete opposite 😭. If they looked through the blue side, they’d see the red pen and if they looked through the red side, they’d see the blue pen. This is because the color red would blend in with the red filter, and the color blue would blend in with the blue finger, therefore it wouldn’t be able to be seen. While the other color would stand out because it wouldn’t be able to blend in🤓.
They couldve also just used wallpaper but ok lol
The Moment a landlord forbids to paint the Walls is a reason to leave...
Cheat sheet allowed what 🙃
the last kid is going places not to the living room but places
There's something satisfying about those notes.
Wouldn't the red or blue ink cover up the layer that was below it?
Somebody else on YouTube already told these stories
Just to let you know the Greenland one was actually marked wrong for schools like that a 1 is the worst a 2 is great and a 3 is the highest you can get.
Lol that first one your dumb as hell bahah
You said red one you see blue pen and blue one you see red pen
Do people really not know that Denmark owns Greenland?
Dude with the pool fucking golden
Not really beating the system more like just being smart 🤧
You got a young genius on your hand
Um that first kid is wasting his time in school
My question is why did the teacher allow them to have even just 1 page of cheat sheet. Isn't cheating like, illegal in school?
Umm they could have just gotten wall paper.
My 5 year does stuff like that little kid. Kids are literally always scheming, lol.
The second to last one. The teacher is a W
I wouldn’t really call the second one “genius”
This is just doing to much
The first one is ingenius, nice
Wait til they figure out paper has two sides
I cheated the system. I wanted to log into my ps4 but my parents told me not to touch it until i ate. I had a camera attached that allowed me to log in with my face so i used it as i did not have to press a button to activate it.
Just wright on front and back
"Congrats to Everyone who is early and found this comment"
Every prof I’ve had allow cheat sheet has a rule it can’t be optically aided. Like no magnifying glass.  And usually other stuff like it has to be hand written.
Honestly that's a legendary teacher I wish I had 😭
It better be good cheese
The last one🤣
Everyone: talking about how smart the kid is     Me: that is the nicest teacher Ever she actually let the kids have a cheat sheet if my teacher saw that I had a cheat sheet I would’ve been suspended and she would automatically give me a 0
The apartment painting rule thing they were just dumb you can’t paint but they said nothing about wall paper 🤔
Not cheese chapstick come oooonnnn
Bro that kid for the test cheat sheet is a fucking genius
Teacher: Put away everything except for a pencil, eraser, and cheat sheet.  Student: Uhhhh...
Was once told I couldn't go to the restroom during class.. I pooped in the corner

Did anyone notice he got the first one mixed up he said if you look through the red you can see the blue
How to actually beat the system beat up your computer “not actually”
The country that owns Greenland is mine.
That one with the paint hue sheets just made their wall look trashy af
The country that own Greenland is Denmark
Smarter than that. A student was told he could bring whatever fit on a piece of paper to the final in his philosophy 101 class. He brought a philosophy major and had them stand on the paper
The first 1 outplay everything
Isnt it sri lanka ?
Danmark også bage er nej tak😂😂
If the 3D glasses guy is so smart, he could've just studied for the test lmao
Hey! That pain strips wallpaper is a good idea! Looks nice and probably cheaper too!
My teacher once told me we could have a one page one side cheat sheet. I wrote on both sides and made it into a Möbius strip. He actually allowed it.
Haha at last...
So you're like a clone of that former SEAL YouTube guy. All you YouTubers just suck content from each other, no originality.
"Don't lay on the floor"
The first one was actually really fucking smart
This shot is so regarded. Why do people look forward to watching this garbage
Bro why would a kid put cheese in a lipstick only eating cheese is nasty why won’t something else like candy not cheese and the lipstick is smart but I disagree with the cheese
It's all fun and games until the kid spills the juice on the carpet
Im sure the teacher allowed 3d glasses in class lol
As a parent of 4 the last one would make me proud 💪😎
The paint strip walls look actually good though...
Yo americans thats not how these 3d cinema glasses work.
The paint strips one is actually pretty cool
The first one is just big brain
Just an FYI, it’s Denmark lol   Who owns Greenland
3d glasses cheat sheet is awesome lol
Btw Denmark
Bruh who needs cheese that bad lol
Papa I dont which cycle should I buy. Mr beast(papa) : then buy all cycles in the store like they did in the apartment
That kid has some really good hand writing.
Can you please leave the internwt
I beat the system my teacher said I must finally learn to use my brain a follow simple instructions by writing it out 100 times then I wrote the word then put ×100
Dude stfu
Is that true in America? You're allowed a 'cheat sheet' in exams? Imagine how bless a Biology GCSE would be
Denmark owns greenland
*“Who else randomly started watching shorts and now it’s just a everyday thing?” 😎*
As a Dane, I find the Greenland one extremely funny.
Dude: genius people who beat the system The people: hmm yes cheese balm
that ain’t the system
Out of all foods to hide he chose cheese 🧀 😅
No one owns greenland. Greenlanders own theor own country, but it is part of the kingdom of denmark, hence not owned by denmark. Dupid murika.
Y’all still have paper test
Too bad the thumbnail wasn't included in the video
The first one hated his class mates copying his work when it was probably simple to do.
Kid needs to go touch some grass
These are all genius
A little boys eating talkies
Fun fact, Greenland is acturly owned by Greenland, But they have the same Queen as denmark
Is nobody going to say anything about the hundreds of paint strips
I mean my teacher asked me what's the opposite of opposite and I put not opposite and it got counted right
Beat the system until she says "No eating on the floor!" 😳😳
Whiw tf owns greenland?
For the first one imagine forgetting the glasses lol

Who lets someone use a cheat sheet during a test? Smdh. Lame
Nonbody owns greenland  Greenæand is a part of Danmark
how tf are they allowed to cheat
Malicious compliance
He was  allowed to have a cheat-sheet?
Call upon the LORD JESUS today!!!! don't wait!!!!!!...there is no hope elsewhere. Today is the day of salvation. ONLY JESUS SAVES. 1Corinthians 15 1-4 is the gospel of salvation.

Love th e little  boy  WHO  BEAT  THE SYSTEM!
Love th e little kid  WHO BEAT THE  BOY WHO BEAT THE SYSTEM!
Love it. Super clever
the kid: put ipad in living room and food in kitchen  me: goes to dinning room
The kid beating the system was the best. What do you say about that mom?!!😂😂
Love the paint strips!! Cool idea and most will ok the paint as long as you repaint before moving out. I’d always get the exact shade they were using this way it was ready to go.
The fact i know what country owns Greenland makes that thing funnier for some reason
Out of all things to put in an empty lip balm you put cheese 🤦‍♂️
If you told me the kid with the iPad was in my kitchen.....I'd believe it. That looks just like my house lmfao.
😀😂that last one is me...story of my life
BRUH
I filled a large soda with slurpee in a movie theater
I'm 600 comment
Heyyyyyyy
Isaiah 5:20 - Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
I would lie on the carpet and not the kitchen floor
I'm the last one
The assigment: who owns greenland Me: yo thats my country The kid: not greenland Me: oh god dammit
They are geniuses. They just know how to deal with rules
what's so genius about a kid pool and slushy
The thumbnail (first photo) tho
The picture about the guy taking alot of soda is really simular to the gisnt spoon meme
https://youtu.be/ZWkG7VHPDsQ
Dude cheese in chapstick Try to tell me that's not a fat kid
I only had one sheet of paper to use on my French exam...I copied my entire notebook on one sheet by just writing small
I like the song of the violent what is the name of the song?
every cheat sheet ive ever made i never ended up using, i either memorized it by writing it down on the cheat sheet, or i didn't even need what i wrote down
I think the cheese one takes the chee- I mean, cake, for me
A lot of thes are just why rules get tighter and how you just get your phone taken
I cant unhear the cupcake remix
But buying paint strips must be costly
My sons the same way about his electronics
The last kid is biggest brain
Im sure that the cheese in the gluestick guy is a real winner thanks for that one
+1 means you got it wrong
First one is a whole other level lol
Why the fuck are they allowed to have a cheat sheet for a damn test that’s stupid
I do the last one all the time so he didn't beat the system
The +1 means wrong
I did the first one
The first picture is god tier iq
The last one had a much easier solution. Go on another room, other than the living room or kitchen.
That kid tho
A genius is a person who consistently focuses their action, on a result their committed to.
We've all done the last one

The last one is the mom should say "My HoUsE mY rUlEs"
Guy: this kid snuck cheese in through his chapstick Teacher: Timmy why are you eating your chapstick? Timmy: uh....I drank paint?
I’m pretty sure the kid that was sitting on the floor the tablet was there because you’re not allowed to eat in the living room where he wanted to be and so he just did that but I could be wrong I’m probably wrong
By the way Denmark owns Greenland
People who buy gamestip
Everything in this video was clever, except the Greenland part, the kid never answered the question asked, that wasn't clever and deserved a negative, but good for the kid gaming a adult who clearly knows less than him or her.
"So, the 'genius' needed more cheats than every other kid?" - my daughter
CHESSE REALLY OUT OF ALL THE THINGS CHESSE 💀🤣🤣
That last one is something my daughter would 100% do.
He said “when you look in the blue side you can see the red pen and when you look through the red side you can see the blue pen” I think there is a mistake there buddy
Lol the last one had my family laughing soooo hard😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🦊🦊🦊🦊😅😅😅😂😂
Isnt it the other way red for red and blue for blue
Haven’t seen anything like these since Dangmattsmith
Someone please tell me why these people all sound the same when the make videos like this 🤷🏼
I actually did the last one🙄
I got $100 that the cheese kid was white.
I Think
Danmark do's not own greenland we just Protect them
Get your facts straight Your videos are fake and exaggerated and are debunked by others
The last one is simple to beat. Just go to your bedroom
The last one is what i used to do LoL
Noice
You're copying Luke_Davidso
I have a pair of 3 d glasses and I tried it and I can confirm it did not work
OOOoooOoooo Translation: picture at beginning is smart
my health teacher gave us a ridiculously  small sticky note and told us we could write anything we wanted on it to help us with answers. i studied the easy ones so i memorized them and the harder questions or ones i were unsure of. i got a good grade on that quiz.
Who the hell snacks on cheese in class
combine the first one with a möbius strip and an A3 sheet of paper
Source: trust me bro
Everyone talking about the video.  Me: Why is it SAFE to say. When would it be dangerous.
Not Greenland ?
Red and blue pen wouldn't work. In the blue lense the red ink wouldn't magically disappear.... It'd be purple.
They can see the Red Hen in the blue side or the red side on the red side like what
Was it so hard to write denmark
WHAT KIND OF TEST REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE 2 PAGES OF GIGA CHAD TINY CHEATSHEET???
The last one is not a kid... he's a God
A kid trying to do that eating and watching a video in the border of the kitchen and the living room might seem like a good idea but it's not going to be worth the beating afterwards
Omg epic
Its denmark btw
Lol
Ahh yes Not Greenland my favourite country
That kid I wish all kids were like that
That kid sounds like my brother. “I’m not in ur room!” *him right outside my room*
Dude, I need to know the story about the guy with the kiddie pool
Which school allows 1 page of cheat sheet, like u can cheat, just a little??
It’s not cheat sheet it’s probably a study guide
Why cheese.-. Like I’m hunger and I want cheese WAIT I’ll just do this 😂
imagine being allowed to have a cheat sheet xD
Mom: Dont eat on the floor
He mixed the color he said the red side will show blue pen and the blue side will show red pen
Y’know, I did something similar in 1st grade (I think it was first grade)   I asked my dad to wash out a empty glue stick and so he did, and a few days later I asked for mini M&M’s and I fit a few in the glue stick. The next day I got hungry in class so I got out my glue stick and I ate the M&M’s.
whenever you hear this horrible music just scroll
The 3D glasses kid don’t even need the cheat sheet their already evolved as ffff
Denmark owns greenland!!!!
What?
Tarumlüg  Programmierer der Master K. I.                                     ....
Denmark owne's Greenland
Bruh,this is so fucking stupid
K but honestly none of these is impressive
Denmark.
Did he just say "If you look through the blue side you see the red pen and when you look through the red side you'll see the blue pen" Dude like wha
Respect to the teacher that let that "not Greenland" answer slide
Question: what country owns Greenland hint it’s not Greenland  Student : not Greenland  Me : I think I know how they got the answer
Why didn't he just use the other side of the page 😭
Bro that kid eating takis
When I was in sixth grade, some kids would take empty glue sticks, clean them out and fill it with starbursts and sell it to other students.
Imagine you are having an *normal* day at school and you just see a kid eating glue
Ah yes the teacher wouldn't see his FUCKING 3D GLASSES
I’m sorry but what the fuck is a cheat sheet like I’m from the UK we don’t do that over here
"Oh hey I will be bringing those 3D glasses on the test" "Ok"
😃👌
I think we all did the last one dude
When they looked through the blue side they can see the red pen, and when they looked through the red side they can see the blue pen. Do you even hear yourself
Denmark is the original peber of Greenland, but Greenland have gotten their own government not Long ago
The first one he could had just flip over the paper
None of this is even remotely beating the system most of it is literally just going through a vigorous amounts of needless work to spite someone or make a joke
I feel like the not Greenland one was just the kid taking a red pen and writing +1 then taking a picture of it to say he got a mark for it
JUST A RANDOM GIRL LOST IN COMMENT SECTION🔥🔥🔞🔞
The fact that he said when you look through the BLUE side you see the RED pen and when you look through the RED side you see the BLUE pen
"If you look thought the blue side they can see the red pen and when you look thought the red side you can see the blue pen" Me:that is not how it works...
The kid at the end is the 💩
That kid didnt beat the system, he brought it right up to the fence and took a nap, which is a much more laid back victory
Dude I did something similar the first one (not my paper shown in the picture) but the teacher said you can use one piece of paper for notes during our math exam when I was in high school, freshman year.  It was math support since I struggled in math. So I went on google docs, and in the smallest font I could still read, used different colors, and completely filled out both front and back of a paper with everything we learned that semester and how to do those types of problems with examples. My teacher said this wasn’t what she meant, but the other teacher in the class room was trying say it wasn’t allowed. The main teacher said that she did say we could use a piece of paper for notes.. long story short I ended up being allowed to use the paper and only looked at it twice because I realized I remember a lot of the stuff that was on the exam. I was bummed out because I spent forever typing it all out and when we finished the exam we had to turn our note sheets in as well. I never got it back either 😕 it was a waste of time but it helped me study. I still struggle with math.
the 2nd one is just pointless, JUST USE WALLPAPER, IT'S NOT THAT HARD
I can relate to the last one by sitting at the doorway in my parents room watching tv while eating since I wasn’t allowed to eat in their room
If you need that much cheat you won't get far after that 😂
The fact that he could have but chocolate or melted Starburst but he put cheese 🧀 😅😆😁🤣
I wouldn't say "genius".... just sensible people who thought it-through.  Props to the kid half-way between the kitchen and Living room!   That reminds me of my own kids. But the teacher who gave "+1" for that answer is gullible.  That kid's answer is only akin to something like remembering the pattern "abbabbcadbb" for your next multiple-choice test... not exactly genius.
Dey
Bro he spent so much time on his cheat sheet that he could have spent that same time and energy just STUDYING
Low Key covering the wall in paint samples looks dope
I used to do the last one😂
That kid in the kitchen was totally me when I was young lmao 😂😂😂
I used the OTHER SIDE of the paper!
Tablet not allowed in kitchen and food not allowed in living room? Imma just go to my bedroom then.
Yo that last boy is just devious
“Not Greenland” Denmark: “no no, he’s right”
Genius
Bro everything is boring 😐
Fun fact: Last picture is probably older than 30% of tiktok users.
Nice. I have seen every one of these on other people shorts before. Thank God for copy and paste. Right my guy. Being original is so hard.
Can't they write on the other side?
Hey You, You Disabled The Comments On The Video What If We Detonated A Bomb In Mariana Trench. I Know Why You Did It.

The Video's Date Is 3rd October.
THE LORD IS KING FOREVER AND EVER THE HEATHEN ARE PERISHED OUT OF THE LAND PSALM 10:16
I would have gotten the belt for that last one
You can't eat in the class so you used a lip balm to store cheese.  Now well my school didn't allow us to bring lip balm.
Wait guys, you're being allowed to cheat in exam?
https://youtu.be/aEy_MKlJKPY
That Not Greenland one being marked up is while America's education system is so bad and their students dumb.
Alright AMERICANS I have a question for you guys. Who actually owns Greenland?
Did he just say  "They use the red one to see the blue and they use blue to see the red"  Bruh🗿
First one is kinda cap,It will make combine the two colors and render it useless lol
❤️
No
These "Genius people who broke the system" are in fact just the reason why the rest of us cant have nice things...
no theyre just effin garbage misfits mostly
Copying from other videos.
THE GREENLAND QUESTION IS EPIC
and legends say that last kid wasn't allowed in the home
With not greenland he didnt Mark It right, he just gave him the worst grade with a plus
"Congrats  to everyone who is found this  comment!"🏆
Why did you add censored -.-
idk about the second one
https://youtu.be/nfhJi9Jl4No
who reads this, be happy and healthy)
*Hmmmmm, Not Bad!*
I write really small so I'm usually the one that fits the whole study guide/cheat sheet on a 3 by 5 inch index card lol
Kelly white. Joclate hi kate
We have all seen the “super smart kid with his tablet and food” millions of times this is getting old
You know you could write on the back
The last one is a absolute classic
Bruh that cheese probably started to not taste good real quick
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
The kid: *brings 3d glasses to class* Teacher: No wearing glasses in class.
God loves you and I do too and he sent his son  Jesus to die on the cross for our sin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
Is this really beating the system or just being an arsehole?   I would define beating the system as having a nice rewarding life. Eating cheese in class or having a giant bucket of melted slurpies is hardly a win.   I feel sorry for these people and anyone else who thinks this "winning"
The cheese is simply unnecessary and weeeeeeird
The second ones kinda dumb
The teacher is also a legend for giving him the point. I know my teacher would just write, "LOL", and take off 2 points(true story)
Did anyone notice that he said when you look through the blue side you could see the red or is it just me
STOP USING WIRED HEADPHONES MICS!!!!!!!!!!
Nice but not nice as much nice want but trin'n nice
Geniuses with 500 iq are technically smart but truly talented.   "What makes you think?"  For one, they've read several books to obtain more knowledge.   Secondly, they create ideas that help the world and themselves.   Lastly, there aren't enough people with the same iq as them. That's why there's emotions.  I say we should spare all geniuses including the entirety of dev sisters and the people who voiced the English dub of C.R.K.  "Aren't we going too far from this?"  NO

Happens everyday, these people are heroes
Oh Wow! That's a lot to know.
I don't think the teacher gave him the point because of some teachers put the +1 to show one extra wrong question not one extra correct question so I don't think so
So we're just not taking about the first pic
The last one is a absolute classic
For anyone wondering, its Denmark(:

The beginning image of the guy with the pool and the slushy machine is something people do in my province on Slurpee day here in Canada. 711 a convenience store does this thing in every province, the province with the most slurpee sales wins a Slurpee day. Everyone in the province can go with any size bucket that has to fit on the machine, and for $2.00 you get all that you fill to drink.   Sorry if my explanation doesn’t make sense
Lol this bad vid (don’t respond)
The kid with the tablet and the food had me doing the same
🇬🇱:Hehe 🇩🇰:bro.
Profit
that teacher is very pog for giving the kid the point
Riririririri

Who would want to paint an apartment with you’re own money
He really said when he looked through the blue side he can see the red pen and when he looked through the red side he can see the blue pen what??
Why cheese
Mans got a bowl of takis 😂
In college when a single cheat sheet was allowed for an exam, I would use to 10 pages and shrink/print it onto one page, then go to the exam with one contact lens out (I'm extremely nearsighted). I could have gone much smaller, but that was a comfortable reading size. At that age I could read microfiche unaided, with some difficulty.
Bruh
Not Greenland... 🤣 He's my nephew.
Cant wait for Part 16
Lol.
(I have done these sins, and I’m still doing sins like idolatry, sexual immorality, and cursing. I need to work on this stuff. This proves I’m not perfect.) I want to ask you a question. Do you think your a good person, if so why? I’ll ask these questions. So, have you ever stolen, lied, thought sexually about a man, or a woman (you commit adultery in your heart), had sex outside of marriage, cursed, watched porn, acted on homosexuality, spending to much time on your phone,  using God’s name in vain (saying omg), witchcraft, or hating others (murder in your heart)? According to the Bible, we’ve done this thing called sin. What is sin? Sin is disobedience to God’s Perfect Law. And we’ve all disobeyed it. And our punishment is spiritual death, and an eternity away from God (Hell). And we deserve to go to Hell. Hell is a place where you’ll remember all the bad things you’ve done, and you’ll regret it. Hell is a fiery furnace that’ll never stop burning. The fire will NEVER be quenched to those who are there. They’re there forever. Hell is a place with no love. And God is love. There is no light in Hell. And God is Light. That describes Hell, and some people reading this is going to Hell now. But I’ve come to tell you the Good News that might turn you to repentance. Jesus Christ (Christ means: The Anointed One, not a last name), the Messiah, came down from Heaven, to Earth, to save us from our sins! He was mocked, rejected, persecuted… And He still died for us. He even gives you air in your lungs. Jesus died for you, on the cross, and three days later, rose from the dead! So that He might save you from your sins. We deserve Hell, but Jesus took it for us. Because of Jesus’s death, and resurrection, we can go to Heaven, and not be eternally doomed! But it’s your choice to repent. What is repentance? It is turning away from your sins, and turning to God! So, I ask you. Turn to Him, ask Him for forgiveness for rebellion against Him, and also ask Him to save you from Hell.  Also, don’t use Jesus as your escape ticket from Hell. It’s your choice. Repent Or Perish.

To paint the wall just get wallpaper-
For my college Algebra class, we’re also only allowed one page of notes for our tests/exams. So I just crammed things from a few chapters on the page😀 Definitely more helpful than not having notes, just like high school. I really hate high school classes🥲
Your move, Harvard.
The paint one actually looks nice as wallpaper
ACTUALLY THATS NOT A POINT ITS HOS GRADE AND ITS A BAD GRADE
I like the way the pool guy thinks. XD
Ririririri

The Landlord should sue them. It’s his place, they don’t own it so they don’t have any entitlement to change what they please without getting permission. They won’t be living there forever 😂

You make  good  videos.

When your teacher allows you to eat in class: *I am god* Like- we actually can eat in class as long as it’s small and not distracting-
Denmark
That one about covering the walls with hue papers seems to be a waste of money imo, unless they got all of those for free
When they look thru the blue eye thing they see red words. My guy wht?
I would simply write really really small and use key words rather than full sentences
Blue side with red pen and red so it was blue pen?

The amount of work put into this could have just been used to study but ayy who am I to complain about someone else decision
The classic loopholes, glitches in games or software.
Don't you hate it when your dog starts meowing because he tied his flip flops forward to fly on the ground so he can dribble the football on his head?
I hate parents like that i mean honestly let the kid have his snack in the living room you're going to clean the room weather it's dirty or not anyway or just let him have his tablet in the kitchen/dining room cause really why should someone have to be bored just cause they're hungry
Is sounds stupid
I know this is the wrong video but this guy stole kurgestats video and just disabled comments to try and cover it up so don't subscribe to video stealers
About the cheat sheet why don't  write it on one side then right  it on the other side
To easy

The kid learned that from troom troom
+1 is one wrong I thought
Hey I don't know you play poppy playtime
If were being honest they didn't 'beat" the system they were just being 'smart alecs'

That paint paper wall is cool and all except for (i know its for the gradient) how some of them have the dark on top
That last one I would be like “ok listen here smartass no more tablet”
Him: this student was only allowed to bring one cheat shee- Me: PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO BRING CHEAT SHEETS NOW?

First of all why are they even allowed to bring even 1 page cheat sheet???

Bruh the glasses he could see the blue pen with the blue side and see the red pen on the red sighd

Genius
FUCKING SMART

If i were to do any of those i'd have gotten my ass whooped
1+ isint right💀
The student that did all the writing on the cheat sheet probably didn’t need it. With all the work of deciding what to put in it, he probably just learned the material
Did he just say when you looked to the blue side you can see the red pen and when you look to the red side you can see the blue pen WHICH MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL
Why does the Mariana trench look like a banana
