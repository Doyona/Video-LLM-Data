*NEW VIDEO* This Ruined My Life https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-lV-VaQkQ0   I know this is probably not what you want... but I really enjoyed making it. haha hope you liked it!!! excited to start making more videos :))
At 16:48, he talks about his future and movies, and by the end of 2025, he is getting ready to film a pilot for a TV show. I love this for him
He’s not Mexican he’s Peruvian!! Chris stand up for yourself 😝
Why’d you say 2 vlogs a month on Patreon when you only do 1 :/ that’s why people are unsubbing. You may not be able to keep up just be honest about what’s going to be on there x
Great article
The lyrics are so touching.
The vocals are stunning.
This track is fire!
Brilliant work by the journalist.
watching this back in 2025 is so so sweet to see how far yall have come and the podcast! 🫶👩‍🌾
This track is fire!
This piece is very helpful.
The harmony is wonderful.

Great article
Music at its finest.
I get it Shane lol love you
The fake acting in this is sending mee 🤣🤣😭
And now he's literally banned from Chuck E. Cheese😂😂😂
So I used to work at a gas station and anyone who’s worked in food service knows that the company Sysco supplies to a lotttt of different restaurants, stores, gas stations, etc. and I’m almost positive Chuck E Cheese is using the same pizza crust we would use. And often the frozen crusts would come cracked or broken because they’re super thin and fragile and the boxes are heavy so the crusts are always a mess. So often we would have pizzas that would have a “gap” in the crust after baking. The chuck E Cheese pizza is just cheap, low quality pizza, with busted frozen crusts made by teenagers and people who probably dont care.
The pepperoni’s on the pizza don’t line up. It’s not the same pie.
I miss this channel so much, I don’t even watch the other one anymore.
21,829th comment
2:14 what was that 🤣 11:09 "o'reilly?" 12:25 lol they just go for it 20:25 lol the jealousy
ooo my god Ryland, so cute
Shane definitely misses the vag lol 😂
They definitely kept making the pizza look like that so that they’d profit
I loveeee this video so much. It is one of the funniest video EVER😂
I love watching at 17:10 knowing. Now that he has a full podcast family and set up, and so much love I just am so happy for you
Shane reminds me of rumble stilt skin however you spell it from shrek 😂😂
I mean if you look at AI and the questions it presents…. It could be compared to the same questions we have. Their universe being the energy that allows them to exist.
I love this video. Coming back to it  when I have bad days.
your not bi your 100 percent gay. you talk like a 13 year old tween girl.
33:13... KILLS ME
13:38 you sound stupid you and ridiculous. This is where I wanna click off because y’all are unbelievable to the point that who would even take you seriously right now. Y’all can do way better.
why do I just feel like shane's dream was symbolic of the fact that they were gonna get a surrogate and have kids?? shane is having psychic dreams... I mean look at him now!
4:27  Okay but Ryland saying “and does this include me in his new life” warms my heart. The fact he was more concerned about still being apart of Shane’s life than Shane being with a woman makes me so happy, that’s real love. Ryland doesn’t care what Shane does so long as he gets to be apart of Shane’s life😍🥰
10:48 watching in 2024 (almost 2025) and obsessed with the podcast!!!
Here in 2024 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
we need the squad marking the bottom of the pizzas like olive garden!
Same. When I was younger I always said there is no way I'm going to be around for 2022 or 2024, but now here I am. Still don't know how to feel about it.
Cut to two years later when his podcasts is all about growers and he has not interviewed a single celebrity
I’m probably Not the only person to say this. I’m just watching these videos!!  But, do they individually serve their slices of pizza? It’s kids place and kids normally get a piece. For their frozen pizzas do they just form the individual frozen slices and put them together.?
18:14 viewers are great I need another 🎉
you legit make my worst days the best
bi..... my merch! made me spit out my coffee, its so good.
Please do this again but ask for the pizza not cut I would love to see the outcome!
This how we know we all getting old asf 🤷🏻‍♂️😂ppl making up slangs about P🤷🏻‍♂️😂😂
Well, you have a podcast now!
The pepperonis aren’t lining up lol
Who doesn’t make mistakes nobody is perfect! Shane is genuinely a good person and idc what anyone says!
lol not the urgent care in the background
That whole crumbles exchange was hilarious 🤣
“parody” 😂
I just came home drunk and I’m laughing my ass out watching these again I love you Shane always have 2013
I worked at chuck e cheese, it was my first job at 16. I was a server and a pizza fell on the floor face down. The cook picked it up put it back on the platter and made me take it out to the customer 😂🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ A kid pooped in the sky gym and I quit on the spot bc they wanted me to go climb in there and clean up the poop
SHUT UP PEOPLE STOP CALLING CPS GAY BIT
the editing for this video is incredible
He said "Fat Friend" Ooh Quick.. Cancel Him. Banish Him. Coventry Is A Nice Town This Time Of Year
as a kid I used to think the same thing about not being there in the future
loveee the conspiracies
The simultaneous ´wow´ 😂
Being banned from every Chucky cheese in the world is such a flex
3:10 what’s kinda funny is around this moment I opened up my fortune cookie and it said “dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so shall you become” so basically rylands gonna get a pussy
“We’re gonna try NOT to get sued.”  20 minutes later: “If any pizza could get COVID, it would be Chuck E. Cheese.”
Why would we be in a simulation. Those theories make no since at all y’all are just paranoid and that’s coming from someone who’s had a generalized anxiety disorder since age 11.
The constant topic hopping is adhd core
10:47 and she was born
I know he had a lot of controversy and what not. But he apologized he took responsibility for it. People for get back then it was different. I love Shane and I’m so happy how far he had come in a personal level
You should go back to Chuck E. Cheese pizza now and ask them not to cut the pizza and cut it at home and see what it looks like
I worked at a pizza place…that pizza is still so suspicious
shane pls come back life is middle school level agonizing again we need u
11:42 SEÑOR PoOoOooo! 😂
I just adore you! I’ve been binge watching everything Shane Dawson! ♥️
I really want a 2024 update 👀👀 maybe send jerid and try it on the podcast
I miss their pizza, when I was a kid, I ate like 8 of them, they were so addicting to me. If I ever go again, I know I'll love it. I'm new to your channel with some videos I've seen. This was funny and had me smiling. The podcast sounds like a good idea.
Literally 23:48 the best part of the video:   Due to local laws we're not allowed to scoop up our pizza off the floor🤣🤣🤣  Do you want regular or stuffed crust?  Make it a mix 😂  Have a chucky day! It means it's the same day recycled over and over again  🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭
20 minutes for a pizza... if you're reheating left overs lol
Do people who leave hate comments not realize all they’re doing is giving him a view & boosting his algorithm, lmao there is worse people on the internet *cough* OJ *cough*
We know what you did zoo file
Uno is so old 😨
14:35 kills me!! Everytime! 😫😂
fastforward a year and he has my favorite podcast!!
Your brother is not very smart tbh
“We made it Chuck E!” 😂😂⚰️🐀🍕
This was by far the funniest video yet
38:47 "Because they're sooo Dangerously Good" is a shirt.
5:46 - i thought their clock has 3 birds and 1 chicken drumstick haha
This entire video was more daring than when you got canceled lol.
I love this video so much, Ive watched it like 79 times 😂
Still wanting to know what happened with the Little Debbie ice cream xD
Crazy how cancel culture doesn't actually exist. And all you need is enough money and fame to get a get out of jail card.
❤❤❤❤I love you shane❤❤❤❤
Shane you grew from your mistakes ❤You learned from them❤ don’t listen to all those haters who have nothing better to do with their lives 😅❤
Full circle moment! History has a way of repeating itself!
Lawsuit chat- 19:54
i'm literally crying from laughter with the whole pizza thing jesus christ
Shane is so happy to get rid of the house....which they never put up for sale
i laughed the entire time 😂
Chucky gonna sue him again 😭
So who won the lawsuit ?
I had chuck e cheeses pizza a month before the video came out and it looked recycled  What's wild is that after shanes pizza conspiracy video, the now looks like an actual pizaaa a perfect circle with stufed crust cheese and alligned pepperoni
I'm dying TPE BAHAHAHAHAHAA even I am gigglesnorting here LMFAO
I love u Shane and Ryland ❤ I'm rewatching your videos n Rylands
If his humor ain't 4 you, you can leave. No one is forcing yall to watch
do you have demon's souls remake?
Cant wait till i can get paid for doing  absolutely nothing!
watching this a year after it’s been posted, and the podcast was DEFINITELY meant to happen. i love you sm shane
He's so gross🤢
Ummmm
I think you have a angel in 1 ear and a demon in the other whispering what to do and what not to do.
Can we talk about the first minute of this vid here? What is your opinion, are we being 'played'?? I feel it could be a thing Shane is considering, cause I just saw the 'The universe is broken' vid and how does he respond to the 'let's get married today' situation... only evasive... is that the gamer doing that or are we 'just us' ....
Thank God that you decided to un-cancel yourself....been watching you for over a decade. These newer vids are so funny! I just feel like we are all hanging out and laughing our ass off.😂❤
Ryland trying to not get sued for 43 minutes
40 seconds we got a mood kill😂 scary music and shane crackin up in the bg
i would've done the same shit long ago
I like how Shane doesn't like to go into Chucky Cheese because of Chucky being a rat but he likes going to Mickey Mouseland.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Maybe they teach the pizza makers to make sure each piece is fully detached to make eating easier.
I miss you shane. Your videos helped me through tough times where I needed to just escape from all the trauma at home. 2014 and now I’m rewatching your videos in nostalgia. You were so relatable to me, it felt like I was watching videos of my friends because that’s sow relatable and open you all are. You were such a big escape that I needed badly in the past, thank you so much for helping me and others who must feel the same
TBH recycled pizza sounds good for the environment 🤷                 I'm all for it.
when the woman at chuck e cheeses said the pizza will be ready in 20 minutes and Ryland said " wow they're quick great it'll take us 20 minutes to get there" SHANE WANTED TO SAY it took them 20 minutes to collect the leftovers 😂but paused
Hey I support Chuck E. Cheese they reduce reuse and recycle 🫡
So no one’s gonna tell them 🅿️ means pimp/ing 😭😭😭😭
SHANE!!!! Go work at a pizza place one day and learn how to cut and box pizza
When they cut the pizza they have to slide it into the box and that can cause them to not slide perfectly.
why was this video so funny!!! i was laughing my head off all the way through
They responded about the shape of the pizza being round and said nothing about the pepperoni being cut entirely in different ways on the cuts of the pizza.
WHY DO WE STILL HAVE NO ANSWER ABOUT THE PIZZAS!!!! Former employees, old company execs? There are some many people that could explain it and we still no absolutely nothing.
Don't sell that house Shane it's awesome!!
love you shane!!!!
❤❤❤
This video is deliciously passive aggressive 😂
Ratatouille is cocking the pizza 😇
P
Chuck E Cheese does have good ass pizza, though. In high school (almost 2 decades ago…holy hell) my friends and I would skip classes and go to Chuck E. Cheese to get pizza lol.
why is the person playing my game so upset all the time
I love your videos so much 💗💗
I know this was forever ago and said already even after you posted this so I wonder if you did put of anger for them trying to come at you haha, gotta be careful with that..  anyway, The mouse is their logo obviously because they are well known to eat cheese, hence the name.  They don’t fit, because they rearrange the shape of the pieces once cut to make them seem interesting, different and an optical illusion and to rope kids in so that their parents keep going back to something so puzzling tto the kids, spending money, same with all of their gaming machines, plus they probably add a shitload of msg, it’s all a marketing technique and you’ve given them a shitload of free marketing without actually getting paid haha.  You could for sure look at it the way you have too though. It’s all perspective. Interesting asf. You definitely know you can make an impact haha. You should somehow set your videos as comedic content if possible so you can legally say whatever you want, jokingly, without as much risk.  Xo
Literally scream laughing at Santa's lil Conspiracy Ryland 🤣😅😆
I’m watching this for the first time and @8:50 I have not cry-laughed this hard in a long time! The honk comment and Shane’s reaction I’m DECEASED 🤣
You are the consciousness seeing, hearing and feeling. You are the experiencer which can manipulate the tools you have access to. Namely your mind and your body. Your body is also your emotional body as well. Your mind is the thought processor. However, while you can manipulate and utilize it's processing functions it contains an insidious feature. Essentially an autopilot mode combines with an artificial intelligence. The mind can, has and will produce unbidden thoughts and emotions. While you can manipulate the mind and create thoughts and emotions manually, the mind does so automatically. It is when a person begins to differentiate between the manual and the automatic that a person begins to have "self control". Jesus said, "Forgive them, for they do not know what they do".  This autopilot is the default baseline for the majority of people. Using cognitive defusion you can begin the journey of self mastery, or "enlightenment".
Can you order a pizza and ask to not cut it?
Other influencers: ...almost get sued by Chucky and will never speaks about it online ever again. SHANE: makes a video about the SAME THING and literally goes back to the place who almost sued him. 😆  wee love you ❤️
😂😂NOT THAT 1 SECOND DISCLAIMER IN THE VIDEO THAT I HAD TO LITERALLY REWIND AND STOP AND PAUSE TO READ 😂😂😂😂
it was so fun rewatching this now that you actually have your podcast that psychic reading was so accurate lmao. you should have tried ordering the chuck-e-cheese pizza as soon as the restaurant opens as theoretically, they wouldn't have any pieces to recycle since it's a brand new day at the opening so the pizza would have to be fresh. if the pizzas still look like they're having a midlife crisis I guess makes their dough explanation real or they're saving pizza slices from yesterday. I don't understand why they just don't do a behind-the-scenes of a pizza being made and shut down the rumours, so like there would be a genuine explanation for the pizzas looking wonky. Like they make it seem like they have something to hide which Is some weird ass marketing strategy
i used to fall asleep to your podcasts OMG
Too much worth commenting on that I don't even know where to start 😂 I'm so happy to see your new content back on YouTube though! My soul lit up like seeing old friends. Where are they moving to?
MayPat made a video debunking this if y’all wanna check it out 😅 I think maybe on his Food Theory channel
Shane and Ryland have come so far, married now and both themselves again 🥹
Ryland was so obviously uncomfortable about Shan flirting and yet... he still continued to do it... why?
Maybe a little too much info... maybe to much word vomit... maybe think before talking sometimes? I'm honestly just trying to help.
Watching this agen February 2023 they are married, baby thinking and a podcast so fun. Love these too.
Rylan ahhahhaha
I love all the love coming in these comments, in my opinion, Shane never deserved all the hate he received. The energy is still real and the Queen is not dead 🙏 Never give up Shane!!
Woah now look at um
I wonder if Shane's a giver or receiver lmfao
Classic Shane
Don’t you guys notice that Shane literally wore a shirt said ‘kill bill’ on it? Sza’s new song.
I missed you, shane, I was off the internet when you left because it wasn't the same. A friend of mine had to tell you, you dropped a few videos and the PODCAST. ❤️ I am so glad you are looking so goooood.
Them going to Chuckie cheese funny I love the outfits
Cool merch Shane
Shane flirting with the camera guy funny
I am all for that Shane starting a podcast
I think Shane and rayland are cute together
I cracking up watching this video those crumble cookies look delicious
Cool truck Shane this going to be a strange video
Thank you for the non stop laughing!!  ur the best please never let anyone stop you!
Wait shawn. Did u never see the food threoy video on this... it the dull blade cutter that causes this
It's funny cuz the same people hating on chuckee cheese pizza still go to Chinese buffets 😆 little did they know
I took my kids to Chucky cheese a few times way back in the day and I agree. If it was cooked as one pie it wouldn't be small big small small big big on pieces.
Your born gay not turned into one. It’s a chemical imbalance in your brain being attracted to the same sex.
A character in a game don’t know there being played😂😂😂
What if you request an uncut pie? Has anyone tried?
swear to god ill will never stop loving shane dawson
We are in a movie and part of it. Like a simulation but affecting the whole world. Be careful when people say “I’ve always wanted to be in a movie”.
Bi coastal bi sexual queen
Do you still bang cats
The emotional music when y’all are in the car talking about the pizza 😂😂😂 y’all are killing me
As a straight dude I admit. It’s adorable. I wish my girl back in the day was this real lol
Senior Pooh 😭😭😭
Pretty sure ppl mean something else by "p" 🅿️ probably has to do w/ why you were canceled
Bro zesty lol
And one year later, you guys are married! 🎉❤🥰
Honestly there is no reason why chuckes pizza is like that. Literally no pizza looks like that but only theirs. And notice how spokes people never explain why. Just how when people think craft American cheese is plastic, they literally said on their website that “Its not meant to be enjoyed by burning it”. No one said anything about enjoying it burnt, like that wasn’t the issue. They all hide something.
Even if Rylan was calling you a pig, this b*tch stayed with you through all the mud. He is a keeper. You better complete the marriage. lol
I love how Shane is strong enough to burst through the darkness like a Phoenix. Fk people. You made mistakes and your owning it but your not letting it own you. ❤
I MISS THE TACO BELL CAKE!
Yay  he’s back love ur videos❤
It would make sense if they cut the pizza into slices, sell individual slices and if someone orders a whole pizza, they take the leftovers (that hasn't been served) and make a whole pizza out of it.
Hey if that first open is true. My player needs to do better.
I forgot it takes Shane an hour before he actually gets to the point of the conversation. Curiosity cured again.
You gross me out
As a bi female who was a democrat and is now a republican, that line had me screaming ! 😂😂😂 missed you Shane
Lololol ❤
“Size inclusive!” Omg lol
“Preach, brother!” 😂
Shane's videos are so comforting and funny. Love you Shane 🤍
petition for tight pxssy energy merch
I love this version of you. You e healed. And didn’t lose the humour we love ! Proud mama bear here
The adhd level in this video hahahahahha
i stopped watching shane bc he stopped making videos for like ever n i already watched everything at least 4 times (literally every video) and now i have like a years worth of videos to catch up on
Shane .. You have Been Warned. I C U. We ALL C U. Once you've been Seen you can never be UNSEEN
ily
Food theory addressed this. Apparently the cutter they use is not that sharp and that’s why the pizza comes out crappy.
I’m 13 mins in and I feel like I did 200 crunches bc I can’t stop laughing! ❤
Hey Shane, remember this lawsuit?  https://youtu.be/YscBggZVsEg
This is the funniest vlog I’ve watched in a awhile.
These edits
My god the intro with all the talking is way too long.
When can I propose to Morgan
“Blended family” I love that 😂 can’t stop laughing ❤😂
The people "playing" our game are also being "played"
I think it’s Britney Spears and then I wake up and it’s Jamie Lynn  Ohhh fucccckkk That was perfect😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Ryland over here googling slang like a forty-year-old soccer mom. 😂 ⚽️ 🚐
I love Shane sm and I’ve missed his videos sm, I haven’t been in a happier space for so long and these videos have really made me happy ❤
u know who this mf look like lowkey?  dream😂😂😂😂
"It's in the beans" 💀💀
I love how direct and honest they are about their downfall LMAO
We need a behind the scenes Chucky Cheese. 🍕
Blended Family Pizza 😂
I forgot bout Shane, I've been so busy with life and working. This is the humor I needed.
I work at a dominos and that first pizza could’ve just been the cutter but it’s still a bit weird 👀 that second pizza is crazy and I can’t figure out anything that could cause that 😂
shane is a bear and ryland would be like an otter or something
I love how when Ryland is on the phone ordering the pizza, he is so not having Shane’s shit. 😂
A bear cub
This video was HILARIOUS 😂😂😂 I LOVE YOU
Also, the level of ADHD in Shane is insane lol
Does anyone else wonder how it's possible that Shane doesn't do stand up? I feel like he'd be incredibly good at it.
Shane Can Most likely be classified as an Otter or Wolf I think in the tribes
It’s in the beans 💅
I could totally see you with a woman because you don’t resonate loudly with the title “gay” man BUT if you say so.
Hey Shane, I know we've all made mistakes and I had to take a break from the drama. I've been a fan since the beginning. I'm back and I love you! Weird, to say but I love the person you are. ❤️🏳️‍🌈 I'm glad you're back!+
Lmao their outfits 😂
THEY MANIFESTED RILEY IN THEIR LIVES!
Crumbles aren’t that good.
I worked at Domino’s and we made everything to order too and yet we never get wonky cuts like that 😅 something’s definitely up haha
We get it and we made it!
ask for a uncut pizza
Maybe they just cut up a bunch of pizzas and lay them all out and take out the amount of slices the kids want after all kids don’t eat much. It’s when you order a full one they have to gather enough to make a circle from them all.
You havent been very active so I have watched your videos in a while but I have literally been watching you since I was like 9 (no I probably shouldn’t have been watching your 2009 videos at that age lmao) I love you !
Elope Shane! WEDDINGS ARE OVER RATED! I've been married for 21 yrs trust me!
This was hilarious!🤣
All psychics are fake 😆😆😆😆😆💰
❤️❤️😆😆😆😆😆😆👍
I know this video is like 8 months old but my God have I missed you. You and Ryland and ur beautiful relationship mixed with hysterical jokes and conversations.
you are a bad person shane. leave youtube. - a former fan😘
Omg its so funny i am from Laguna ca and born in LA and omg I seriously bought a truck and said to my husband MOVING TO COLORADO CHANGED ME LOL WE LVEU SHANEY POO BEAR LOL 😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I SUPPORT YOU
I could watch you guys all day!
"Before you know, you don't know" 😂
Shane sorry for what happened to you im glad youre back i missed you as much as i miss glam n gore and jenna marbles .   I want you to know as a matter of fact Shane Dawson   YPIRE ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT 😍  Btw swoop is a troglodyte and a B🤬tch
I wonder if its always been sliced weird or if its like a new thing cause i dont rememeber it looking like that when i was a kid i also cant remember the last time i went to one maybe like when i was 10 ??
Shane has to do like diary day when he just talks all day to the camera about his day :-)
NOT PIZZA INCLUSIVE 💀💀
Someone you know should go undercover and work there for a bit and let them figure out why it’s messed up
But how do they explain the mismatch pepperoni
We made it chuckee🤣🤣
I cant believe i made it” 😂😂
Señor pooh”! Hahahahaha dude i cant that was hilarious😂
I’ve been watching a lot of Shane’s channel videos lately and I so appreciate how authentic he is. He is genuinely funny and genuinely himself  which is admirable compared to most “influencers” quoted because I hate that word.
sorry but chuckie cheese sus
Hmmm if we are talking about conspiracy theories than the best one is that I can’t find any negative comments on this video 😅 Where are they😮😱
Somebody smack them niggas
So people just forget about mofos who got exposed? Wtf is going on.
"Bipolar"
The only thing that I thing would make sense as to why their slices shrink is if they the the pizza BEFORE cooking it
this comment section is so weird supporting a guy who’s said awful disgusting sexual things to and about little girls.  so bizarre to me.
Litterally using the same light up mirror to do my eyebrows while watching this 😂
I get it, yeah thought  off self long ago but guess not ha ha🤪😜
I sat down 5 minutes ago saying I just wanna watch for a few minutes then I’ll start doing homework then I looked at the clock and it’s been 5 HOURS
Oh so your a democrat?  Love the company you keep! 🙄🤮
As some one the as work in with pizzas sometimes when you cut the pizza you accidentally cut it wrong
You should flip the pizza over and see what it looks like that way lol
Shane's face expression when baldy was explaining simulation😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💯💯💯
Haha could imagine instead having a O’Rileys theme song do it as “Oh oh oh ohhhh Ryland, Auto Gay!” 😂😂😂😂😂
37:18 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I want Chuck E. Cheese to explain why their pizza looks like that then.
Shane looks so different now
We missed ya
Wtf happened to him
i’m three minutes in and this is the straightest I’ve ever seen Shane what’s going on💀
Why is everyone ok with him now? He's still a terrible person who hasn't taken accountability. He hasn't apologized for like- anything. He just said oh I don't even lnow that guy oh I'm so depressed so I'm gonna sexually abuse kids.
GET off the platform ya nasty. Go get therapy please
Why I love Shane. Just dying over here when it starts. Even before Chucky... Cheese.
When Roland is showing off his cup at 4:59 and Honeys ears are just in the background. So cuuuute  😩
Ryland is so boring he should have kept the out fit on you guys should have tail gated…
literally the only thing i can think is that they purposefully cut them in different slices bc kids and adults like different sizes.. definitely not though
Shane I’ve been watching your videos since the BEGINNING. Will never forgot how much you helped me. Will always love and miss all your videos. Thank you 💜
your film & tv agents name is one letter away from uti
I hate how they had to clarify that Emma didn’t send them anything so she didn’t get any hate :/ like wtf
No actually, if any normal intellectual human takes more than 2 minutes to think about it, there are a very finite number situations leaving a pizza THAT mismatched like it's urban art.  If u think about it, either every employee is an actuall moron and re shape peices by trimming them to explicitly mismatch them, OR THEY RECYCLE THEM. All the excuses coming from the company make no logistical sense. Maybe the people of the company are just dumb for no reason idk, but take ur time and think about it. Just think how many times does one natural excuse work? How many times does an employee genuinely struggle with an industrial pizza slicer so many times that it fucks up a pizza  E V E R Y TIIMMEE.
Idgaf I love u Shane
27:49 I dead ass spit up my soup seeing ryan in that all I could think is “omg he is really wearing that”
lmaoaoaoaoo love shane but tbh wondering if its because they were cutting them straight out of the oven...cuz most people buy them in slices...aaaand when someone orders a pie they just put the precut pizzas together?? possible?
Shane: Mentions interviewing Pornstars Ryland: Ok, calm down. Too much vagina Me: Now, now. He could be talking about interviewing Johnny Sins 🤣
Ppl still watch him lmao
Love this but chris missed the PERFECT JOKE because there's an urgent care in the background when they're at chuck e cheese 🤣
Omg I love GOTG ❤️  I have a double POP funko of baby groot and rocket and it's super hard to find those 2 in anything 😫
I get the whole 2022 thing, I fathom that in my little pea brain back in the day 😅
Marry Ryland already! he's sending you in your face hints..you can't miss those signals!
Go to a justice of the peace for the marriage then just have a big wedding reception where ryland can change his outfit every hour💜💜💜💜
Imagine playing a game we’re you choose to be an accountant with unstable income   Lol that would suck 😂😮‍💨🫢
Always loved ya. Keep your head up you wonderful human.
Try ordering one NOT sliced and then see how it looks and what happens when you slice it yourself. I think it would be interesting
I literally love Shane so much and I forgive him for everything (although I was never one of the people who tried to get him cancelled) please never stop making videos. You are the only YouTuber that GENUINELY makes me crack up!!
But In all actuality who is playing a game just to be on YouTube TikTok and Instagram all day and have depression 😳 we are more complex than a game.
God rn must be laughing
Lol" I'm not a dr, so just letting you know " 🤣🤣🤣
Lmao at 15:00 I 🤣🤣🤣
Shane looks great
“Digestional”
Can you please do a conspiracy video or a documentary on Jamie Lynn spears? Idk I feel like it would be some what entertaining to watch lol
I missed you so much🥲🥲🥲
i just have to leave this here, I get it bby
I feel like you guys are gonna break up... a lot of your conversations still today are very funny but very aggressive.  Shane used to be way more loving in the old videos to Ryland!!
I don't care about anything else except the fact Shane makes my day. I love him
Watch MatPat’s video on Food Theory
genuinely surprised people are acting dumb and like hes a good person 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Only thing I don’t enjoy is the gas-guzzling truck
Don't forget to clean off your phone camera lens before every use. I swear it makes a huge difference. :)
Food videossss
I prefer him to Jeffree if I’m honest his content is better but aside from that Jeffree is a lot more controversial and he’s the only one out of the two who went out of the way to cover all of his stuff up Shane is more real and authentic
I totally agree with ypu and your brother Shane love you from johanne from the UK 🇬🇧 ❤ 💙  I love you
the fact that he made it through the storm with chuck e cheese has me DYING😭
Ryland was definitely a stage mom in his past life😂
Shane and Rylands interactions between the other guy. Maybe I’m just thinking to much but I think ryland is jealous
I'm sorry but this shiz is FUNNY!!!
Can you please interview someone who used to be an employee and just blur their face? I need to know why the pizza is like this!!!!!!!
IVE MISSED THIS GUY LMAOOO
When Ryland said "tight" I died 😂😂
"27:07... just so people know what you're made of... just so people know _what I've lost..._ " hahahaha 😆 also 27:45 "back in LA... _lets make people worry!!!_ " hahahaha I cant!!!! Love you Shane, Ryland, && Chris!!
shane is who helped me through my darkest times and despite the stuff that happened and how i disagree with what he’s done i can’t just overlook that he’s basically saved my and many others life
You could save all that money from lawsuits by just not being an awful person,Shane.
omg the next video should be "whats in shane dawsons hard drive challenge!!" :DD
WAIT Shane knows he’s at goodwill😅 that’s too funny because I’ve been wanting to tell you my brother came home from the thrift store with a framed T-shirt of you from maddd long ago😂 for us to keep! And I was so excited! And I’ve been thinking how can I get ahold of Shane to tell him! But obviously you already know😂😂😂😂
do you still like little girls?
God is king and is coming back Jesus died for us god gave his only son so spread his word get right with them they love us
I AM CRYINGGG AT WORK 🤣🤣🤣 not the “HAVE A CHUCK E. DAY” 😂😂😂😂
You know I've never watched any of this content before and I am genuinely enjoying the dynamic everyone has. Shane's funnier than I realized.
what if you call chucky cheeze and ask them not to cut it
the vibe between shane and ryland plus the cameraman was weirrrdddd. i wonder if the psychic told him he'd end up marrying a woman.
The "psychic" stuff is something anything could easily fake just by watching one of Shane's videos lol. Sorry Shane but, obviously she's gonna know all that
Also I haven’t seen a single hate comment everyone is being supportive of you shane
Yo Shane imma straight man and if you would ever like to sell that truck I’ve been looking for one LET ME KNOW!!!🥹
Jarid is always a trip
Gay ?
I worked at a pizza place as my first teenage job, and yes when you cut pizzas... they can be different in width, but not the length like this pizza lmao! I had like two birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese when I was a kid in the 90's... I wonder if they were like this then lmao. They renovated the one here where I live many years ago, and I am tempted to order a pizza now. Haha!
why is shane always so dismissive of ryan and how does ryan put up with it, i know it’s all jokes but i would never be comfortable with THAT many jokes at my expense and i wouldn’t be okay with my fiance jokingly flirting with someone else
Am I the only one that wants “I’ll go home” quote back😭
WHERS THE TPE MERCH ??
Been watching Garrett's channel. You should reach out doesn't feel right its like when the beatles broke up at least you self reflected and realized we didn't give a f*ck about Jeffery star videos we just wanted paranormal content
Shane is really just genuinely funny. Shane life is too short to worry about what people think/feel just keep doing what makes you happy (and maybe Ryland too) lol
🎶O,O,O, O'Reilly's.... Auto Parts....Ya🎶
I don't think Shane and Ryland are still together anymore, because every time they're in the same room and speaking to each other there's some underlying cringy tension in the air😬
I can tell he’s a Taurus ♉️ no one gets us lol 😂
The person in our brain is our soul
I love the new cancelled dgaf Shane. Totally 🅿️.
Shane don't wear a damn suit.
I love Chris’s
Seeing the inventory of the conspiracy makeup really broke my heart. People are such sheep in this world ong. I’ve never stopped loving and supporting Shane. I have both pallets of Shane’s and I ordered them the day they came out. I love them immensely and they’re the only pallets I have (I’m a single mom and can’t afford luxuries for myself) and I wouldn’t trade them for anything.
It’s so crazy that boring people like this walk into a room as big as the Internet just to share how wasteful they are with food. And for what? Shane loves to talk about his weight all the time… All whilst wasting food. The homie really puts the Moron in oxy
… It’s so weird watching Elder millennials not be self-aware. This is all very forced. And a very specific brand of loser behavior. Everybody involved needs a therapist Heavy
Shane im here for everything but im 20 minutes in and if you don't get to the damn point I swear to god lmfao
anymore videos with Jeffree
For the pizza why it’s longer or shorter it might be because when stretching the dough they might stretch some pieces to long and some shrink so that might be why and sometimes after cooking and cutting it it’ll separate and that’s why there’s gaps I make pizza a lot and I will say my pizza does come out looking like that sometimes but it’s just a theory so nobody come at me!
what if they just cant freaken cut a pizza lol
THROUPLE MOMENT chris shane and ryland
Their comeback is such great news. Shout out to the negative people out there everyone's allowed to be alive. If you're stuck in their past go live there and don't watch.
Shane has no idea how much he really helps people. You make me really feel like I belong somewhere bc I’m literally so far out like someone help me LOL
Anyone think his psychic disclaimer could have been a jab at the Psychic Twins…? I don’t think so cause as he mentioned it takes a lot for him to trust psychics and he seemed to really trust them if he kept coming back (perhaps they lost connection after they said him & Ryland would only last 7 years? Curious what other fans who have noticed this think). And in my experience, I’ve actually seen the Psychic Twins predict quite a few things right even at times when the collective didn’t even know they were right (like how Trump wasn’t supposed to win in 2016 lol…). Thoughts?
I started to sneak his videos past the parents a long time ago in 7th grade. Now my mom watches them with me & my sis now that we’re in our 20s 😂 but his channel was very different back then & even more explicit but that’s what confused me about some of the controversy because no it doesn’t make it okay, but a lot of the films & shows back then were just like that. They would push taboos just for the heck of it without actually believing in the opinions it could seem like it was suggesting (i.e. Scary movies, any parody film ever, Beevus & Butthead, etc) so it wasn’t surprising that Shane a teen from that era would be influenced to want to make shock-worthy stuff whether it was right or not. Luckily, this generation seems to be a lot more level-headed than us (and I’m 26 so I’m probably the generation right under Shane—so weird cause I remember watching his vids when he was 22 & thinking that was so old 😂 he certainly has done so much more than I have at my age! Sad that all the controversy has kinda canceled that out) so y’all prob don’t watch that kind of entertainment & I don’t really recommend it, I never got why people liked it so much except for some reason Shane’s humor would be the only reason I’d put up with that style. Cause of enlightenment from my generation & the ones that followed that finally realized “hey this actually has negative effects” that’s what brought on all the controversy but it becomes like debates about other eras’ whether they get a pass because that’s how the culture was at the time & how people “fit in” or “stood out”. I think it should be a little bit of both as long as they acknowledge growth from it & understanding the wrongs and I think Shane has then a bit of understanding on other peoples’ parts needs to be given too. It’s an equal give & take. But anyways, my whole spiel is that since I’ve literally grown up with him it’s hard not to always care for him in the background as life changes for all of us. And I think that the core of his heart is good whether people want to acknowledge it or not (Ryland & his family wouldn’t still be there if it weren’t—if anything’s problematic it’s the hardcore Christian life his family had growing up that some prejudices could have come from that he was used to & subconsciously came through his work but I don’t think they were ever HIS views or intentions), he deserves to still be cared for and we shouldn’t feel bad to care for another fellow human being who also makes mistakes like everyone does.
I love you Shane lol
OK I 110% respect you and Ryland‘s marriage but holy shit watching you drive that truck was one of the hottest things I’ve ever seen in my life
In all fairness, sometimes when you cut pizza the crust slides under the cheese and can give it this same look. Although it normally happens when using one of those cheap home dull pizza cutters. That being said, you'd think a company who's business is making pizza's for large groups of kids high on sugar and toys would provide better tools for employees if that was the case.

Shane Dawson please seek God turn to God when you feel any form of doubt or negative emotions . The Lord will save you and show you the truth . He will help you understand.  Rebuke the devil in Jesus's name Shane
I’ve missssed youuu daddddyyy 🥹🥹❤️❤️❤️❤️
“Before You Know, You Don’t Know”
Pornstars?! Can you please get Dani Daniels on? She's so cool! She's actually very funny and social. Its not all about the porn and sexual stuff so she'd be a great guest.
I just moved to colorado, what part were you living in??
I miss his old videos but his documentaries are also pretty cool
Can I just say I have missed you so damn much!!!!!! We are stuck with you like your stretch marks!! 😁😂
I’m
Idc what you’ll haters say. Shane is friggin hilarious. 😂😂😂
Missed you soo much Shane 😭
“here i am, beautiful and unique in my own way. 😃 …and here you are. that. 🙂”
Sean followers who keep him on this platform are su coinfusing how can u support a man who has commited such vile things especially with children
coming from experience if they dont marry you after proposal of three years they dont want to get married and they are considering other people.
I love how positive Ryland is about everything ♥️
This makes me want to get a job there just to see what is up!
I swear I just got my wisdom teeth taken out and I can’t be laughing 😭😭 I love watching Shane’s videos so so much 😭💜
CHRIS CRUMBLES
It's the P for me 😂
Omg.. I can't stop laughing lmaooo
before you know you don't know LOOOL that got me xD Also Shane isn't fat. Everyone gains a little bit of weight its normal. After having my kids I was 40 pounds heavier. Just learn to love and accept yourself.
It's been two years since I've watched this channel and I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. I've really been going through it and I just want to thank you guys for making these videos, I'm sure you help a lot of people through tough times with your jokes and positive vibes, I wish you all the best <3
Missed you so much, watched you for years. You mean a lot to me. I love to see you back
Sheeeiiittttt
My ass turn in to an adult & haven’t watch you now am back
imagine thinking you can still be liked on this platform after what you've done.
source : trust me bro
I worked at Chuck E Cheese when I was still in school. And no they don't recycle pizza...they do however throw it away, even a whole pizza that no one claim. But if you have a cool closing manager, they do let closing employees take the unclaim whole pizza home 😁.
Do a conspiracy video on freemasonry and the illuminati PLEASE
i just got notification of this video n hot so happy,but then i seen how long ago it was posted like seriously oh well I im just so damn happy y'all are back i re did notification bell hopefully that'll fix it.YOU LOOK AMAZINGLY HAPPY MUCH LOVE TO Y'ALL 👏❤
bro i watched this man when i was 8-9, and uh hes the reason i love conspires theories and such so i am very Surprised to see him pop up on my recommend after i stopped watching him but im glad to see him again
No matter what Shane is my comfort person❤️
When shane opened the pizza box, all I could hear is Tyra Banks yelling "i was rooting for you, we were all rooting for you!"
Consult your doctor before you go to Chuck E. Cheese… lol it’s dangerously good…
The whole Chuck E Cheese segment had me in tears 🤣
u can really see a change in shane, im proud of him ❤️
Omg y’all rly went to Crumbl I work there and it’s not bad but it’s a struggle and I never made those that would probably be fun
chris crumbl
Best comedian ever the funniest guy 😍
I have missed Shane I left YouTube when he left. I’m back baby and I am super happy to binge watch Shane’s latest videos over the past 4 months 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻❤️❤️❤️ love you shane and ryland ❤️❤️
pushing 🅿️
Haven’t watched in years and I’m cackling y’all don’t even have to try lol
I skipped a major part of this video and I'm doing fine. Just saying.
i hope you both get married and have a family-only, remote wedding somewhere nice.
You disgust me.
I worked at Chuck E. Cheese for a short period of time and since I was a Gameroom Attendant I brought guests their food as well as watched the chefs prepare the food and I can 100% assure everyone it was not recycled as I had to clean up and I had to go to the kitchen regularly.  :) It gets hectic and that's probably why the pizzas get wonky.
If the three pizzas were $80 in total than each would be 26.66 repeated meaning 666 the devil so Chucky is the devil☺️
💗
They really seem sad if you watch it closely.
Are all these youtubers or whatever you wanna call them so fkn fake?
I know I'm a nobody and insignificant but just gonna say this now.  I absolutely hate cancel culture. Its ridiculous and stupid. Unless someone is legally told they cant make/create/produce something you can do what ever the hell you want.   I dont think it's right that the people who supported and loved "you" would want to stop "you" (and when I say you I mean in the general since. Not just specific to you shane)   In my opinion and in my head I think of you (shane) as a great comedian and creator. And because of that you should be able to joke about anything you want....except chucky cheese obviously. 🤣🤣🤣  You be you bo, dont let anyone or anything stop you from that. Love ya
40:58 spending 80$ on 3 large pizza 😳🤡 what's  going on AMERICA ?? Its only 48$ in KSA
My hubby does training if you wanna look fantastic in your suit 😍💪🏻
I kinda hate you right know..
I feel like Chuck E. Cheese could be making it weird so it's fun for kids?
Wtf is this bullshit?
Idk why Chuck E Cheese bothered suing. To prove a defamation claim as a public entity, actual malice must be proven.
What!!?? Shane likes the MCU??! Same!
I’m pretty sure the cutter thing makes sense. Since it’s an establishment/company targeted towards kids, their pizza cutters are purposefully dull (I think it might be a legal thing or there was an incident in the past). However, they are so dull that it’s cuts up the pizza wonkily. If you’ve ever tried cutting a pizza with something other than a pizza cutter (something like a knife), you know what I’m talking about. The cheese can get ripped up and since the ones from chuckee cheeses are probably coming fresh out of the oven, it would be easier to manipulate the dough shape since it’s so hot. You also can’t take away the fact that these are being made by teenagers who are probably just there for their summer job.
Wait... the camera man is gay now??
why dont you listen to ryland he so sweet you couldve have tasted banana one
I love this so much. I binge watch your old videos and this feels like you're back 😍😁❤️
What's the word of the day Shane??
Watching your videos makes me feel like I have friends but without the constant worrying of being used or talked about. Love you shane and friends! 💘🧸
"Due to local laws we're not allowed to scoop the pizza off the floor" IM HOWLING 😂😂😂😂
"We're back in LA! Let's make people worry!" 🤣💀
Omg I love you Shane 😂
Everyone volunteering for jhonny deep but shane dreams has me wanting to volunteer im down to be rylands sister wife lmao
SHANES BACK!!!!!!
GGPE gorilla grip p$$$$ energy
LMFAO 🅿️ > if I understand correctly the entire phrase was initially “Pushing P” which meant “keeping it real” I think, but people just say P now
Pushin 🅿️
Little Caeser's don't come out uneven like this
When you said if Chucky cheese would sponsor a dominoes commercial showed up hahaha 🤣
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdypKKKQ8uA food theory episode about chuck e cheese pizza
Theory! What if they sell half pies or individual slices, so they complete full pies when they’re ordered so as to sell the oldest stuff first 😅
Omg I know that psychics voice. It’s the one from real housewives
There's not a little man controlling you, literally and metaphorically. What your brain does is automate tasks for you once you learn to do something. Your brain holds your conciousness, and it's up to you to guide your brain into automating tasks and making decisions. Free will isn't really an illusion if you think about it, you just need to know how your mind works to take full advantage of it.  Side note: most of the things we do would be way harder without our brain automating it for us. Writing, reading, driving, *breathing*, it's needed for everything we do.
Are you stupid about the P thing. Like for real Im concerned. If you do know why would you make jokes about people accusing you of that
Watched Shane from the time I was in 7th grade. I just graduated highschool. While I think I've outgrown him and don't agree with his past actions it still made me feel a little bit better to watch this. 💙
Taco Bell is gonna need to give that brand deal back to you, cuz you're roasting their competition.
I really missed Shane's Energy 💕
OReilly or OReilly's Mandella Effect What do you remember?  A lot people I know remember it as OReilly's and they still call it that.
This is what young people watch- just wow 😳
It was the tailgate for me😂😂💕
18:10 manifest some bitches- ill go home
10:10 self destruct button gay
if anyone wears "TPE" merchandise. they 100% do not have the TP....🤣
Dudes?! Chucky cheese is a mouse not a rat and mice love cheeese, gets it babes?! Hahahaaa
maybe they cut half cheese and half pepperoni from two whole ones and the next people who order half get that other half thus the misalignment.  I dont mind they not aligned or from same batch...that place make great memories, and watching these video makes me want to eat there
Hmm....maybe "Bi-Pedal??!"🤷🏼‍♀️ 😁
I LOVE YOU SHANE DAWSONNN
hey can you make the purple hoodies available in smaller sizes again? I want it lol
you called it at the right time where you said this is where you lost the straight audience lolol
its called D.I.D.
2:00 The Jeffree Star Mannerisms for two seconds.
Come on. Admiral Byrd.
I missed you, Shane! ❤️🥹
When you all get the covid jab and thats what replaces your langhan cells in your skin to connect you to the cyber punk world
What pi@@es me off is the fact that I just wasted 43 minutes of my life watching this video...you're welcome guys 🤣 Love you both anyway. Wish you'd get back to your usual content though.
All the lost potential good funny content these past 2 years just because some overly sensitive Gen Z kids decided that Shane had to be cancelled.....over some dark humor...smh  miss ya shane.
Wait a minute hold up... It was the (Riland)- "I spent 80 $$$ on this!!" For me!!!! How much is one pizza?! Almost 30$$$$$?!? For scraps from previous guests to make a whole pie?!?! A real fresh large pizza with one topping doesn't even cost that for 1 large pizza!!! Chuckie cheese is straight robbing customers! 80 bucks for 3 pizzas! Rediculous!!!
i fucking love shane
Got 2:03 seconds in and already too much gay energy lmao
Love how Chris doesn’t correct Shane to say he’s Peruvian.
that pizza is definitely recycled, hopefully they don’t sue me🤣
Pushing P
“Made me republican, take off that mask” lmaoooo I died 😂
I missed you Shane. Been watching you from the beginning. never gonna stop💜
Still 100% believe that the pizza is recycled
It is SO NICE seeing the crew back together ❤ making jokes, living for it
A easy way to tell if they’re not from the same dough is to flip the whole thing over in box. The scorch marks will have patterns that line up on the bottom. Easy peasy.
This > conspiracy theroys
Ryland, I'm slow watching this but I hope someone commented and told you that Shane's dream just meant he wishes it was possible to biologically have a baby with you. ❤️
The slices don’t make sense
Is Shane still friends with Jeffrey?
The way Shane will always be my comfort videos no matter what
Did anyone mention that this conspiracy theory is featured in five nights at Freddy’s: security breach?
Can we go back to hating this guy? Thanks ❤️
I wonder if Ryland was genuinely trying to not get sued
Ryland if you ever feel like Shane’s kinda rude to you/disrespects you while he films for his channel it’s not just you..
Idc about the children but plz admit it Shane did u do anything to ur poor cats
As a person who made pizza at Pizza Hut o.o something ain’t right but we friends chuckie don’t come for me
Not the disclaimer 😂
36:41 I’m so glad they agree. How would that work? The employees would have to be lobbing off whole chunks of the pizza for that to make sense
The intro: I believe we’re in a mass simulator  Me: yeah full of idiots and pedophiles 👀
i’m so glad your back
Gods I love how Shane always makes things hilarious, I clicked onto this video thinking it was going to be one of the serious ones and it ends in a Chuck E. Cheese pizza taste test lmao
Judge me. I love Shane. Fuck if I was on video all day….
Okay 19:04 is a whole mood 🤣🥳🥳  we made it *plays Post Malone's celebration*
The way Ryland looks at Shane . You can see he loves him
Young BABY BIRD BATH
Where’s ur old camera man?
How do ppl still like him 🤢
If you cut the pizzas while they're still very hot, the cheese will melt over the sides of some of the slices and make them not come together evenly anymore
I can imagine Lori, but im nothing like that
So people have just forgotten what he did to Bobby Burns??
you should order a very strange and specific combination of toppings to which the chance that someone else had ordered it is extremely low and see how it comes out
Yes please find amazing foods and eat like you used to YUMMY also I think you should continue the Chuck E. Cheese conspiracy
I think Shane might be more straight than gay. I've always thought that. I could be wrong!
what the fuck is wrong with yall
2:00 xD im dead
I wasnt notified of any of his new videos!!!
I work at a (different) pizza restaurant and even when the guys have some trouble cutting the pizza with the “heavy cutter” it still lines up properly.
I was at the grocery store the other day and I seen frozen chuck e cheese pizza in the freezer section! Made me think of this video lol.
What happen to the other guy that use to film
Add me on Facebook. I'm in Champaign, IL. Let's fuck shit up.
Welcome home daddy
even if the story about the handmade bases and cutter is true how come the pepperonis rarely line up, they definitely recycle pizza
Love you Shane keep up with the videos missed you I think you're so great and honest loved the scary videos ❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Hi, just want to say that this is my first time watching shane after he left and i've thought about something. I'm a very clumsy person, and I say stupid shit sometimes, but that doesn't make me a bad person. I'm not justifying what i said in the past because what is wrong is still wrong but the difference between me and shane is that he was very famous and that meant that the whole world could cancel him like this. What he said/did was wrong definitely, but nobody is perfect and he stayed real regardless. I don't think he deserve to be cancelled indefinitely just like i shouldn't be cancelled either for some stupid shit i said. Life is hard, and yes he did make videos which are controversial but still, we all do that stuff, doesn't mean it is right to do so, or that one shouldn't be punished, it just means that regardless of the bad, he did good. And he's still human. No one in the history of Hollywood hasn't done something controversial,  even the most loved. Humans are bound to say stupid shit it's how we cope. Shane gave his fans a sentiment of being a part of a family even when your life was total shit. And for all his fans, me included, I haven't been able to find this elsewhere on the internet and that's why he's so special. Because he's relatable. I'm a mess, he's a mess but still, at heart we aren't mean or bad.
Be yourself! Growing is everything! (Ha triggered ) anyways just do you! Love you Shaaaaaaane
You should get sponsored by Cindies or Katz
🤣🤣🤣
fun fact that doesnt matter at all and nobody cares about: the roller coaster they show at 28:26 is called White Lightning at Funspot Orlando.
I feel they bulk make pizza and slap the pieces together, I don’t think they recycle them. But that is a weird practice to have. And the half and half’s look like they make a whole cheese and a whole pepperoni cut both in half and stick the 2 different half’s together. Still fresh pizza but it’s still weird 😅
"TaKe oFF tHat mAsK." 😈🤣🤣
The pillow fight between Shane & Chuck e lmfao
What if they pre-cut the pizza before they put it in the oven.
Shane I would love to be on your podcast I wanted to tell you that  you are my hero and that I am the 5th Female in San Antonio texas to get my Eagle Scout and I am Bi Queen like you
Shane… I’m so glad you are back. I were literally my childhood ❤️
shane the world needs you!!!!
Shane, your brother is going to mess you up to a point where therapy won't work anymore, if you ask me, the more you let him talk to you about these crazy topics.
I love you, we all love you, please never stop being exactly who you are
Jamie Lynn would be a horror nightmare 😂
Love Shane but why am I worried this video is gonna make him get cancelled again
https://youtu.be/mXGnPoNFO54?t=687
Yes... because no controversies or anything happened as a result of Shane and a podcast
i missssssssed your videos! CRAAAAACKUP!
WTF is the iron man image at the end??? lol
I love Shane so freaking much! I’ve watched him since I was younger and still love him I’m an OG fan & will always be a fan his humor is unmatched 🥰❤️
“If you’re watching this video, you get it.”    YES!
p mean percocet :p
I literally was cry laughing throughout the whole video !!😂😂 shaneeee i love you 😂 ryland & Chris are hilarious too 😂😂
This is like my 50th time watching this video but I CANNOT express HOW HAPPY I AM TO HAVE YOU BACK
Shane getting offended by Ryland's comments, but then "honking" in a room full of pig merch.
Won't get married... A few months later....
Then I guess I got a smart person controlling me and my senses lol
camera work is so shotty andshaky
I’m sorry, but if we’re in a simulation of some sort…. WHY DONT WE HAVE SUPER POWERS??? 😭😭🤣
Chuckie is definitely recycling pizza 🤮
since the day i started watching his videos he has never failed to make me die laughing
Y'all it's obviously on purpose that chucky pizza is like this because that created many controversies therefore they make their product unique even though it's as common as a pizza to get people to talk about it just like Starbucks does with the names and the wrong spellings they're made like that on purpose you might even argue that that's the best free publicity ever               Ik many people know that just wanted to put it out there we love conspirasies because it's fun even though it's so east to figure out the logical explanation
Ive watched this video so many times and If I didn't just spend a ton of money for a ticket to Hawaii I would be buying a purple pig sweatshirt. I still might get it and not eat. JUST KIDDING.
someone should call and order an uncut pizza from Chuck E Cheese
He should get a pizza from all the other pizza places and compare. See if it is just chuck e...
The fact I saw Chuck E. Cheese pizza frozen for sale in grocery stores during the lockdown was wild. Kroger I think?
I used to work for a pizza place, who’s name rhymes with “Flominos”. We used a regular round pizza cutter that you can buy for your own household. Only machine-type thing we used was the cheese disperser, which was like a cone. It dropped the cheese evenly on the pies. I wholeheartedly think those slices are not from the same pie at all, because the color of the crust doesn’t even match. I know there are oven variances, and sometimes one side will be darker or lighter. But That doesn’t look like what’s going on.
Shane desperately trying to fuse them together to not get sued
Conspiracy theories of chicly cheese with Shane Dawson 😳😂😂 33:10
love you! ❤ So happy to see another video! I love your sense of humor! 🥰
Damn... I remember watching you back when you were with lisbug and up till the breakup when I thought 'why the fk do they need to break up because he's bi? thats like me breaking up with a girl because I like women with big boobs more'.
This video has become a comfort video to me
ive worked in pizza for 8 years.  there is absolutely something wrong with those pies.  but like, you would think someone would have spilled the beans right now.  this is genuinely so crazy to me.
I think it depends on where Chuck e. Cheese is cause I had a friend who used to work there confirm that theory
It's obvious there are pieces cooked longer than others. & pizza when cut hot some cheese would melt in the crevasses! It's obviously not the cutter. I never liked their pizza. So glad grandkids grew out of going there! Even the salad is hot & gross!
I don’t understand why people insist on digging up dirt to “cancel” people… you really have nothing better to do?
Ryland holding the light for Shane while he's on the bean bag is like a mom recording her son's band recital.
I am so in love with Ryland! 🥰
Two and a half homosexual men discussing the extent of their vaginal interaction is PRECISELY the content I waited 2 years for. Lmao
6:21  Shane: I’m going to call you Chris—mas because you stole my hea- Ryland: Heyy!
instead of Chris Cringle...Chris Crumble
they’re like kids while rylands trying to order 😂
Shane i want nothing more in my life other than to meet you. that’s all I can say. i love you
they are already married 😂
I still have my pig merch and I love it boo 🖤☺️
The amount if ads is absolutely insane
Okay but WHERE IS THE KILL BILL SHIRT FROM I LOVED THOSE FILMS
if their pizza got covid they would be chuck e sneezes
16:13 these dumb funny moments are why I love shane  ❤
You should pitch a reality by series, you guys are so funny with out even trying to be! I literally watched you just walk around and talk on the first part of the video, and you had me laughing so much!! Kardashians who?? I wish I came across your page a long time ago!! ✌🏼💚🐷 P.S. I would totes listen to your podcast 💯 !!!  There are tons of celebrities who’ve had controversies and people will forget about it.  Anyone who follows you and sees your videos knows how you joke.  We all make mistakes.  There’s a new generation now who you can also appeal to.  You are talented, and I know you inspire so many of your viewers!!!! ✨🌟
My throat is tight. I do get it I also didn't think Id be here WE MADE IT.  Wow you really didn't want to get sued with these disclaimers lol. I have never eaten there and I never will EW. I did not like your food videos, but amen do them if you want. I don't even really understand why you were "canceled" and why you vanished.
My favorite depressive person.
yo if we in a simulation why can't my player make better fuckin choices
Plz interview Chloe Cherry on your podcast
Even though many people still hate shane, I believe he has changed and I’m not going to fight with anyone about it
I love growing up with you. Thanks for staying true to you dude!
do they just not know how to make a proper base? doe needs time to set and rise so something is wrong. it aint cutting the pizza that does thats
Make new conspiracy videos! Please bring them back!!! We need them!! Now!!!
SHANE!!! I NEEDED THIS FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS!! Sooo glad you’re back I remember watching the Chuck E. Cheese conspiracy video 🥹
I love shanes kill bill shirt
When I went to chuck E cheese in Canada with my friends we weren’t allowed to mention Shane and my friend who was wearing his merch was asked to change. Fucking crazy
I have laughed so damn hard watching this video.. Thank you Shane I needed this..
Still got my piggy shane your a different kind of inspiration. Love you man.
I can explain the pizza conspiracy 1v1, if you ever wanna know , reach out (:
I wanna watch all the marvel movies but like what order where do I even start that's some goals shit! I was proud of myself for watching all the Star Wars movies in order 1-9.
I love these random videos I love watching them on my break and just having another world to go to thank you Shane for having the courage and making these videos very weird title but thank you
Ryland is crying out in these videos.. & Shane is dismissing it.. I imagine it like that behind the scenes. I’ve been in relationships similar.. & Ive also acted like Shane.. which was me being uninterested in my partner. 🥴🙈
Shane you are my favorite YouTuber 🥰 you are so entertaining
I cried laughing during the whole Chuck E cheese bit. Like I haven't laughed like this in a while. I can't lie I freaking love you Shane
Ryland saying "It doesn't matter what it looks like it's good". Really reminds me of how I was brought up haha and was really light hearted and nice to hear.
TPE IS SOMETHING E L S E
Chuck E. Cheese literally cuts all their pizzas put them in one large bucket then builds a pizza Everytime. That’s my guess 😂😂😭
RYLAND U CAN’T SAY BROTHER TO SHANE
Lmfao chuck e we’re friends 🤣🤣💀
Imagine being a zoophile
I really want the money pants lmao
Shane could literally do a conspiracy theories about himself😂😂😂
Maybe they’re cutting the pizzas all on the same counter and messy about it so when they transfer them to the box they accidentally mix them.
Shane please do a video on bepop&bebe on TikTok!!!!
If gay as a personality was a person lol 😂
could be shapeshifters too and i worry ab that
i think its humans controlling us  with the simulation in our name
couldn't stop laughing throughout this whole video LOL. so good
He should do what he mentioned and order it and say not to cut it. When I’ve made frozen pizza and cut it wonky it still looks like the same freaking pizza. The pieces still fit together the way they should.
please make conspiracy theory on jungkook being princess diana i am going to shit on my new album and send it to you if you dont 😡😡😡😡
please make conspiracy theory on jungkook being princess diana i am going to shit on my new album and send it to you if you dont 😡😡😡😡
please make conspiracy theory on jungkook being princess diana i am going to shit on my new album and send it to you if you dont 😡😡😡😡
New game: Everytime Shane says "kidding" take a shot.
we missed you so much bb 🦋
WAIT I have a spirit guide named Christopher!!!! Omg twins 🥰
' Covid Relief  Fund  Went to Police & not People '  Watch the video  on    ' The Jimmy Dore Show  '
Shane just watching you grow as a person has made me smile so much  And I picked up my phone today sad and I put it back down with my syndicate in the moston according to you I think I swear we have the same mental assurance lol I cant with the  Chucky don't come at me because we're friends lmao 😂 I love u 💓 💗
Is he deleting comments or something? How have people forgotten what a horrible person he is and what he's done? Ridiculous.
Shane’s videos have always helped me get through the toughest of times🖤good to see you back
I want to get hired at Chuck E. Cheese for a week just so I can see how their pizza is made hahahahaha
"oh you look well" 🤣
Glad your back buddy
8:29 jump scare lmfao
Thoroughly hilarious and entertaining. MORE! :)
Our old shane is back finally
This deserved a rewatch. Comedic genius 😚🤣
Well chuck cheese pizza is crap

Idc at this point, I’m bored, and I need another conspiracy video.
they sell by the slice. of course there will be different pieces
Miss you!!! Love your videos ❤
Shane, I never canceled you, because you saved me from my darkest childhood times. You reminded me that life is precious and hilarious. I waited patiently until you knew it was time to come back. Missed you. I GET IT. 😉
I get it, we did make it
Keep your head up high Queen stay strong I love you
I love Shane but why YouTube is censoring
this is... odd.
hilarious
One thing about bisexuality that *some* gay people don't seem to understand: if a bisexual person loves you, that's what matters. They won't put a sexual organ before you. And if that bi person does it, then it's because the relationship is over. Not because they're bi.   Remember: straight and gay people end relationships too and sometimes it's because they want to be with someone else. This has NOTHING to do with the sexual organ of the other person. They just didn't love their previous partner anymore.  Let's avoid putting the blame for relationship issues into other people's sexuality. It's prejudice against bisexual people and it's devastating to a lot of them.  I'm not saying Rayland took the situation to this level, but his fear comes from a place of ignorance.  My interpretation about the dream: in some ways, Shane is sometimes reminded of being with a woman while he's with Ryland and that's fine. Shane loves Ryland for who he is. It's not about missing anything. It's about how gender is not the BS rigid concept that we're told when we're kids. And our brain don't accept the BS culture wants it to believe. It sees the truth right through it.
What is wrong with yall, y'all are literally going to pretend all the horrendous shit he did never happened
YALL SWITHC UP SO FAST I CANTTTTTTTTTTTT
Ew
Oh shit you back....
As Ryland sits there and downs the actual leftovers 🤣
Welcome back bitch we missed you!!!!!
Ryland is the best. He goes a long in any conversation. So lucky 😁👍
I'm so happy you're posting videos again I was depressed for this last year who cares what people say and who they cancel you're loyal fans will always be here and will enjoy any video you put out as long as you're in it! you guys are selling the house with the little Barn and your Mountain LOL if you move into Colorado will be closer to family that's awesome though
Shane I'm so happy to see you back to your old self! We've all missed this side of you!
I think they prioritized serving the freshest slice to customers who dine in and just order 1 to 3 slices only. What happens to the left overs are remade/reconstituted  to a whole pizza then packaged for pickup or delivery. They do this for 2 reasons, the in shop diner gets the freshest pizza slices every time and they also get the prettiest slices every time.
pls not them trying to figure out what p means
I just think of Trixie Instantly when they sing O’Riley’s them song
Shane n Ryland reminds me of Cam n Mitch frm Modern Family
To be honest, the wings there made me feel sick 🤢 & Shane's desperately trying not to get sued here 🤣🤣🤣
I think about Shane having sex with a woman - and I’m usually the woman - I MEAN WHAT NO I DON’T I HAVEN’T HAD A CRUSH ON SHANE FOR HUS ENTIRE YOUTUBE CAREER I MEAN SHUT UP
Hi Shane you probably won't read this but thanks. I really appreciate your channel. I do get it, I didn't think I'd be here either. Keep it up.
We made it 😆  Okay "this" is why I love shane he's so relatable at times.
Gross
not the urgent care behind the chuck e. cheese
I think it’s amazing you’ve come back from such a dark dark time the last few years. It’s a testament to human faith in resilience.
Imagine Shane went in, and then they said 30 mins and they threw these out
Where is the new video. I seen a post about it like weeks ago. What's up? I Hope all is well
There’s no way these comments aren’t being heavily censored, I refuse to believe that everyone is so happy to give Shane a free pass.
shane be honest did you change because of the joining illuminati video?
Ryland got hot
"She's like Sexy" 🤔
When you talked about Lori I was like "Oh my God, I remember her! She scolded me for having myo (make your own) sandwiches at crafty when I worked on 'The Chair' because it was distracting the crew! " Incidentally, Shane I doubt you'll see this, but I wanted to say it was such a pleasure working with you and you were so incredibly nice whenever we interacted. Remember freezing our butts off in the Heinz Field parking lot in that truck??? Yep that was me lol Hugs from Pittsburgh 🤗
i love you shane!! always been my favorite youtuber
Rylan’s hair is remarkably so nice I think it’s stunning love the new do!!
Can Pizza get Covid he is so funny I love you Shane!!!!
My boyfriend said they just throw that bitch around when they cut it
Ive never laughed more watching an entire video on YouTube. Classic Shane
“This is like a “where are they now?!” Rylan: DARK 😂😂😂😂
Shane: In my dream, your vagina.. Ryland: TIGHT 💅🏼😊
You got engaged when I started dating my boyfriend we had a kid and we’re getting married this October
Such a great video! Laughed the first 10 min straight! You seem so happy - And it’s wonderful and fun to watch! Go go go!!
Welcome back, Shane!
I laughed so so hard… I’ve been watching you Shane since I was like 10 years old and I’ll be 20 this year 🥲 I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
Do more Hang With Shane videos. those were fun to watch.
Love you Shane!! Watched you 4 years so glad you are back
Chuck cheese pizza is good doe
Omg😂 I'm dying of laughter!😂😂 Shane, you are too funny!😂 Glad to see you again! I'm sure whatever video you create, is always going to be a good one, I'm looking forward to it💕
"Made me a republican, take off that mask" lmfaoo 🤣.  I didn't know Shane was back till now
Rhyland are thé pizza like a i eat hot lunch infront of my friends
Shane always makes me smile. Which is something the internet usually doesn’t do for me.
Have a small family "come as you are" wedding, anywhere. That's what me and my husband did.
Idgaf I LOVE Shane always will.  Him and Ryland are goals and Shane is fucking hilarious and a good person and has helped so many.  I do NOT think he deserves anything but happiness.  I’m so glad he is coming back w videos.  We all need Shane videos
no
You should get a reading done from Tyler Henry, He’s on the show life after death on Netflix !!!!!! It would be awesome
:* memory
we get it. love you Shane.
Him continually badmouthing this establishment after already getting sued clearly shows he hasn’t matured. They already explained why the pizzas are like that and if they actually investigate the pizza and flip it over, crust shows the same cook color. He should srsly leave this place alone. Its getting annoying
Is it possible to order pizza and ask not to cut, just hole thing?
Shane’s hands are deff sweaty💀
The real conspiracy: they took you down because your conspiracy theory on the California "wild" fires was true.
What’s the camera man’s @ 👀
It's the Santa's little helper dress for me💀🤣
so many positive comments 😭
Pushin  🅿️
Ok I'm not asking to be rude but are Shane and Jeffrey on good terms with each other these days?
All yous in the comments ain’t right in the head, supporting this utter sicko  🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
nah cuz i hate shane but i can’t stop watching these videos💀
I had a dream last night n I woke up tryna find the coke that was in my pocket that I didn’t have which was only in my dream 😂 I don’t even do coke but I wanted to do it for some reason waking up 😭
i relate to looking like it i have a lazy eye and once a doctor asked me what i was looking at but i was just tired and my eye was looking at the fucking ceiling lol
i’m gonna learn video editing MY WORD and by the end of summer i hope to have the money for decent gear. i’m doing these videos, i’ve wanted to forever and half ass tried two years ago. this was the blue moon unannounced hour videography of shane i needed to find the will and determination.
You should have your own conspiracy show? The editing on these is 🔥 🔥
L
We love u
Are hate comments being deleted or?
WE MISSED UUUUU🥺💗
As someone who as worked at papa Johns those pizzas look normal
Why isn’t no one talking about Shane dreaming ryland had a vagina 😂😂😂😂
Shane, I missed you.
leave shane alone
I know I'm late, but legitimately glad that you're back, you deserve way better than this platform
it’s crazy how everyone in this comment section can just forgive the many horrendous things he’s said and done.
What are you doing on YouTube nobody said come back
I laughed so freaking hard this entire video. Shane is so naturally funny, I missed him so much 🥰💕
Christmas lol
It really sucks that no one in the comments watched Food Theory’s video on this. The pizza is like that because of the cutter, it’s a simple answer.
DO A PODCAST, ASAP! With video of course :D
Uno is getting so grown up! He's still adorable though
I missed you SO MUCH SHANE! Please keep making videos!
what if the doe isn't perfectly round when they baked it
I need more ghost hunting shaneeeee
gets sued so freeddom of speech isnt a thing anymoreee xD
you should bring it up to your therapist how you keep bringing it up and then say you can't do that anymore
Ryland gets on my nerves so bad
I am dying. I’m so I’m love with this video 😂♥️
Lol I loved the iron man bit
pls ill literally be a guest if you need one, I can wear a viva pinata costume iconic
i miss you shane 😂😂💕 you have me cracking up at work don’t stop making videos again love you guys ❤️
He should of said “Ellen” talking about tight pu**y lol!
someone should get a job at Chuck E. Cheese & spill wth is happening
T1he thing that made me hate shane was how he acts like hes poor, broke and homeless when he lives in a literal mansion and has more money than most of us will make on our entire lives. Being broke isn't trendy or relatable. It's just cringe, I don't care if he has more money flex it do whatever enjoy your wealth. The problem is whining and making satements like "I'm poor" when you arn't
Has everyone just moved on from the drama already?
Should’ve been your lawsuit fr
Fuck. I've missed you 🤣
love this content Shane!
convenient that there's an urgent care in the same plaza as chuck e cheese
I dont understand why people like him so much.. 19 million subscribers? Bizarre to me
Tpc 😂 periodt!
I LOST it at that Cee lo Green comment at the end. Like literally my abs hurt 😂😂
Ryland honestly made that pizza look so good I almost swallowed my gum LOL! I’m considering ordering a pizza to go today on my way home. Yay!! You promoted Chuck E Cheese pizza. That’s totally 🅿️. The part you said, “OMG, maybe their logo is a rat because they eat trash” had me rolling 😂 yet the pizza still looked good 🤣
And I miss your life hacks Shane bring them back ps you are one of my favorite you tubers we have a lot in common we both grew up poor and we were and are both over waight as a teen (im14) our favorite animal is a pig and you just save me and I feel a lot better now that I found a youtuber that I share things in common with love you 💜❤️💝
Shane this is shit you said in the chuck’e cheese video and I quote. “This is just a theory I don’t wanna get sued for this” like what the fuck
This is just great Shane🥰
🅿️ basically means keeping it real and being a real person. in my eyes i see it as being a positive, motivated person who wants to succeed and resch their goals and tries hard but also like keeping it real with people, not lying, and being someone that inspires people and someone who people can look up to.
Does Shane like not know trans men exist lmao
The ADHD is so fu**ing stong and im here for it bish. missed your ass THANK GOD UR BACK
Rylan is awesome and lovely and grounded. he deserves to be a happppppy human in a genuinely fulfilling partnership
I’m happy for Shane and ryland. It sucks that Shane’s immature and inappropriate comments in the past are still following him. Like we all say stupid Shit when we’re young. But they should feel like the can do what ever they want for themselves and their future
the jamie lynn joke had me screaming 😂😂😂
I’m so glad he’s back on YT
i do miss these random rants i will say
the real title: THE JAMIE LYNN SPEARS PROJECT
Will Forte vibrs
Shane is wayyyy too gay to be driving a truck.
Paedophile
I laughed every ten seconds.
i'm not sure how to feel about him coming back to youtube. i used to love him before everything came out about him doing all that gross shit i watched his videos every single day i do honestly miss him but at the same time its like do i miss you that much? what he did was not ok he should have go to jail for it i'm just not sure what to think i haven't watched the video because i'm scared all get hooked on his videos and want to watch them all.
We love you Shane !! We missed you so much 🥰
Everything i ever wanted. And dident know... Next thing you know , you dnt know. And im ok with that.
Bi yourself
me saying "same" 30 times throughout every video.
Dont you dare stop making content! please.... <3 i need these (:
The fact the Ryland doesn't care about the pizza ironically shows how much of a perfect match is he is for Shane XD.
This is my first time watching Shane since he’s been cancelled in a little bit nervous , but I always loved him ever since a little kid and I never seen anything wrong until somebody told me this is not right, i’m not gonna lie to you I do miss him
Pushing 🅿️ baby
He was playing with fire right here  😭
Shane should do stand-up
dang, I would love to spend a day with Shane! I need some more laughter in my life. Shane come to Denmark! <3
Can’t believe this guy is into kids yuck
God u remind me of bojack horseman omfg
Please make more Merch!🥺
3.8m views? Wow...
I can tell rylands salty about not being married 😂
Everyone deserves forgiveness. IF and ONLY if they are willing to 1. Take accountability for their actions, and I mean GENUINELY take accountability. 2. They SHOW that they have or are willing to change. Not say, SHOW 3. They give a true honest sincere apology. Shane has done all 3, therefore I forgive him and I hope everyone else can aswell
I’m so ready for the podcast❤️❤️
I don't trust Chuck E cheese...
TPE ? Barbara : Can’t Relate 💀
Waiting patiently for another Conspiracy Video.😭😭😭😭
Cancel culture is so cringe. The fact that you can’t joke anymore on the internet because the “woke” kids will try to “make the world better” like how about going after actually criminals? Not people on the internet who offended you for saying something. Bunch of snowflakes.
So did shanes and jeffrees friend ship fall?  Shane did so much for jeffree
I was thinking about the workers eatinf a few slices because they were making jt bigger than needed be lol
I didn’t know about this video until today why does YT not tell me omg and it did it with conspiracy video I didn’t know for several days. I also follow him on all socials and didn’t see anything. Conspiracy?? I see ryland’s stuff ALL the time!
Yay we made it! Lol ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
$80 for 3 large pizzas? That’s a total rip off, especially when they have next to no toppings on them.
can you sell a pair of your under wear again and see what they go for now lol
I need the shane dawson podcast, I haven't watched your videos in forever but watching reminded me of the genuine joy and laughter you bring me.
shaneeee i missed youuu
Honestly, imagine being a guest on Shane's podcast. The things I would bring up to him and MY THEORIES. Its just surreal. A real fantasy.
The fact that they tried to sue you when there's evidence of them doing this nasty shit baffles me
I worked at a gas station where the pizza cutter made it impossible for me to get even slices... so it is a thing
p actually could mean various abbreviations good and bad
Shame dawson
Close, but it’s deeper then that
Now we know who’s the top
ik about the stuff shane did, but you gotta admit, his content is still pretty solid
okay but are we actually getting the tight pu$$y energy merch bc like take my money damn it 💸
Maybe Chucky takes two separate pizzas, one cheese, and one pepperoni, and cuts them and fit them together to make one. But they are fresh, just not the same one
Bilateral, Bifercation, Biology, Bilary, Bipartisan,	Bind, Bingo	Big Bitter	Binge Bike	Biting  Birth	Bid Bible	Binoculars  Billion	Bicycle Bite	Bin Birthday	Biscuit Bishop	Bigger🤗
I just could not love him more than o already do omg
Omg I love all your video they always make me happy!
Please DON'T Stop Making Videos !!!!! You Are Sooooo Hilarious & I Loveddddd The Chuck E. Cheese Conspiracy Video..... I've Been Watching You Since You Dressed Up As Shanaynay & Other Characters Waaaaaay Back Then!.
can someone else control my simulation?? the one that is in control now is super boring, they make me just stay home, eat and watch Netflix
You could make a colab with skylife, you have the same interest in metaphysic but she's more into witchcraft. It would be fun for you to enter into thw witchcraft side of youtube. I'm thinking about it because of your last posted video that i saq before this one. You really have a talent of intuition.
I have came to the conclusion that something is seriously wrong with yall🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 now make more content please
WAIT! $80 for THREE pizzas?
I don't get how this is entertaining.
“Before you know, you don’t know”.😭
Wth💀
Peephole
Hey buddy I got lots of free time idk how much they pay you to delete comments but ur in for a ride better call second shift
Prdophile
Shane, this was absolutely hilarious😭😭I have an idea for you tho. You should go to the store and try Chuck E. Cheese new frozen pizzas that they sell now. And then see if the frozen ones are lopsided as well
I still love you mistakes aside. We’ve all made mistakes. What matters is growth. Good to see you guys happy. ❤️
The pizza is probably like that because u ordered half and half, so they probably use the other half for separate orders or something
I didn't realize how much I missed this.
It's OK Shane, I'm bi and with a man. I miss vagina too lol
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TOO. we want it all. god i missed you so much.
Oh gosh u have me crying laughing 😂 ahh how I missed you Shane 💕Good to have you back xx
i missed thissssssss 😃😃😃😃😃😃
More conspiracies Shane!!! plzzzzz
2:54 *lisbug: 👁👄👁*
2:20- 2:23 sir SIR, prepare for all the incoming 🐈 insults AGAIN (ppl need to get a life) Bless your heart you sweet clueless angel.
Rump swapping balloon knot loving debutante
🤣 before you know, you don't know
Yes!!!! I cannot wait for this podcast! You should interview your brother! Ive really enjoyed listening to him in your previous videos 💗💗
PLEASE DO A PODCAST!!!!!
Turns out all you have to do after being exposed for inappropriate behaviour around minors, racism and bullying is make a bad apology video, leave YouTube for half a year and then come back like nothing happened. Great job, everyone, fantastic to see we’ve all learned from the countless times this has happened. At this point, I’m convinced Shane could literally murder someone and a few months later y’all would be like ‘omggg shane!!!!! Missed u so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️”
I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time! Shane video always a good time
YES!!!!!!!!!!! SHANE IS BACK!!!!!!! missed you
I wasn't even suicidal and I didn't think I'd live past my 20s
"The lawsuit"  he doesn't talk about his legal things going on or anything about what happened, just goes on like there was no big deal thing that showed is true colours and just talks random shit "im back" like half of us didn't what you back boy. you can stay gone no problem.
So Shane has all this drama go down of how he low key but high key sucks and is a shitty guy and friend. Leaves youtube for only a year and comes back like nothing happened and like we don't all know he is kinda gross and shitty. But our queen Jenna who is literally the sweetest person and is the best leaves and we can't have her back. How does that make sense?
BRO O’Reily auto parts YEAH! It’s next to my house I can never get it out of my head.
Update from Tran! Ryland and Emile are dead. Abusers die. God kills them. Be scared if that’s you and you have raped someone (which includes hands and mouth on genital also making someone do that to you, or if you force someone to rape another).
I just love Ryland. He is so funny! 💕💕💕💕
Missed you Shane! Keep your head up! ❤️
I don’t care what you guys say I love Shane’s videos
Get the pizza, uncut, cut it at home and see what it does.
Omg I’m so glad you’re back! I missed you so much ❤️
You ain’t pushin 🅿️
Your new cameraman passed the vibe check
Welcome back Shane!!! So happy you’re making vids again!
Ryland has a vagina ...oh wait no he doesn't awww..lmfao
Shane I've always loved your videos. You make my day when I see a new video gets uploaded. I really want to get some of your merch to support you when I have the money for it. Then I can always have a piece of you with me. You are so funny and cool. Never take no ones shit you don't deserve it. Always keep a smile on your face and never stop being you. ❤️
Love this bro 😎
the cameraman laughs as much as Austin Mcbrooms  Mother
bring back the oh my god pig sweaters and t's and I'll buy out your stock
Ryland should leave Shane honest
Tight 😂😂😂😂
I'm honestly glad to have a pizza where the slices are actually cut. Even if it means cutting it before boxing it, causing the pieces to shift.
How am I just now seeing this??
"If your watching this video.. You know." I love how right you are lol
I missed this! 🥰
I’m not sure if I like all this V talk 😭😳….
You and Jeffree still friends??
why not just tell them not to cut the pizza that you want to cut it yourself ... then you will see if it is mixed slices from other pizzas or not
So when are you gone address your long history of pedophilia jokes and perverted antics? Also, don’t forget the part where you scammed your fans into buying a makeup pallet and saying it’s not for the money when it truly was.
After having watched several of your shows I know I would absolutely love spending hours on hours talking and exploring any and every conspiracy theory/UFO/alien/cryptic/psychic/ect phenomenon with you. As someone who has always wanted to believe and be open to and know more about possibilities that go on beyond what is set in front of us I know we wouldn't run out of things to discuss!!! That being said I'll get to the actual reasons I've sent this message, which in itself has a low probability of crossing your radar, but...   I would like to invite you and you fiance to come to Maine. I would love to put together a tour for the both of you that shows off the best of what this state has to offer while spending hours exploring all sorts of esoteric questions of our universe and how and why we're here as we go and around the campfires late into the night discussing all sorts of possibilities....   Why you might ask? Well, that's where it gets a bit odd. While I love showing off Maine and I truly love long discussions exploring the universe and consciousness and what it means to be alive and what may or may not come after that isn't my impulse for writing this. I'd like to help you and your fiance plan your wedding. Not in any payed or compensated form, just as someone who wants to see two people genuinely happy and I saw that in you two tonight. Weird I know. But it would be weirder trying to lie... so anyway I'll leave it there. If you'd like to chat more on any of what I've mentioned or just in general please feel free to contact me. If not I wish you nothing but the best, please keep putting out interesting content and don't ever stop asking questions!   The only people that don't like questions are those hiding behind lies  Best wishes, Jeff
“sorry its my lawyer” HAHAHAHAH he is so funny unintentionally
Shane! I would love for you to create something about all of the evil in the world, higher ups, cults?, satanists?, etc.
Ik this sounds bad but Shane got canceled BY THE WORST PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET
Ryan should go undercover as a chuckle cheese employee
The cause in the beginning of this video... OMG IVE MISSED YOU!!!!!!
T-tight B-bussy E-energy 💪💪💪
Ohhhh I missed you! As an old millennial- I too had no idea what “P” meant. And rubbed my temples the same way 😂😂😂 ironically too you had an ad about birth control that goes up the vagina.
I’m so happy your back Shane, you was my whole childhood, so nice to see you happy and smiling again be yourself no filter needed 😅💙
The cheese, sticks once out the oven and they cut it so it looks wonky sometimes any type of pizza from any place
I missed you so much! I myself have dark humor and it’s crazy how shit gets twisted just to cancel someone. Looks like that didn’t last long and I’m loving it and you!
how can u not love shane dawson
OK so my fiance is also a Cancer like Shane (bday is July 20) and we have been together for almost 9 years.. engaged for over 2 years (will be 3 by the time we actually get married). Don't feel bad Ryland, it just takes them a while to commit apparently. LOL
I would cut my tongue off to meet you I love you so much ever since fourth grade when I watched your parody of the story of my life I got addicted lol I can’t believe I’ve been watching your videos for about 10 years now I love you please never stop and please don’t die until I’m successful and get to make videos with you
I’m gonna de bunk your theory so when a pizza won’t fit In The box or is mis shaped the person who cuts the pizza will cut out the a strip of the pizza to make it match hense why one pizza could look perfect compared to the next as well as some people just don’t take their jobs seriously and don’t care to make the food look presentable but something to think about !
*Physic mediums talk to demons, open doors to them for control, a demon talking to ur demon to exchange information & ppl with discernment, like me, sense energy, know things when not looking for it, etc*
What a boring vlog
So glad you're back!
As someone who worked at Chuck E Cheese (for a year) specifically after seeing your first video, they make it themselves, even down to the dough! :) Pizzas are cut using a rocker knife and then just slid in the box from the cutting board, that’s why they always be coming out greasy. All in all, Chuck E Cheese pizza is probably fresher than most chain pizza places, and the only thing frozen about them are the meat toppings. Veggies are fresh, cheese and sauce are from refrigerator and the dough is made fresh!
Did ryland get sick
I missed you yaay
i laughed so hard thank you
Im glad youre back ❤️
Listen, Shane’s videos are awesome. Don’t hold the past against him. I’ve watched his videos since I was a kid. I enjoy them all still.
I feel bad for Ryland in this video, it really reminded me of my past relationship. I hope this is all just for the video, a character they both just display.
AGAIN I love the content of this video and I love you shane ❤️💜
WE MADE IT CHUCKYY! 🙋🏼‍♂️
shane hasnt married ryland yet? wtf...kinda wierd yo
Okay this is my theory. They bake two separate pizzas. One is cheese, the other pepperoni. This is how they prepare their Half/Half pizzas. Both are baked, they cut them. AND THEN they combine the two separate pizzas to make the order for half cheese and half pepperoni. And that must be why parts of the pizza don’t go together. So the slices in a way are from recycled pizzas. So then the left over pizza slices just get added into the next cheese pizza as an “extra slice” which is why they all look so *ucked up! Does that make sense?
My theory here is, say that they bake two separate pizzas. One pizza is cheese, the other pepperoni. This is how they make their half/half pizzas. Both are baked in the oven. They com
Urgent Care right behind Chuck E.Cheese??? It's an omen.
This is one of the funniest videos in a long time!! 🤣 😂🤣😂🤣
Im so happy you’re back!!
What lighting is that
So stupid funny I love it like how can you not   haha
🇵🇬
This comment section capping a lil too hard
Ok but why is Shane flirting with camera guy
Shane: I don’t why I’m filming this. come on in!  Me: god I missed watching this videos while eating Taco Bell 😂 now I can
Cant stop laughing at Ryland’s outfit😂😂😂😂😂😂
Do you hope its a simulation because you stay getting cancelled you barnacle
I haven’t laughed this hard in so long!!!
IM sure Shane would've won the case CAUSE EVERY GOD DAMN VIDEO THERE'S A WORD THAT HE SAYS "THIS CONSPIRACY IS NOT TRUE"
dawg....
Shane is the only YouTube I be cracking up 😭 he’s just too funny for me 😂
Shane is the most charismatic person on youtube imo.
I honestly wish I was Shane’s friend
I watched this during my treadmill work out and laughed the whole time out loud in the gym lmao I loved it
seeing how many supporters you still have is scary and alarming; you are literally the leader of a cult
I feel like This theory devalues life in a weird way🥺 we definitely have to train are brain 🧠  haven’t watched the whole video though.  Continue to watch😁
I think the pizzas look even
The chaos is so amazing. I have missed this so much!! 💚
LMFAO! you guys HAD ME DEAD XDDDD!
the way yall went from hating shane to just liking him INSTANTLY once ppl didnt bring up the shit he did really just shows how you guys dont give a shit abt what hes done and the ppl hes harmed  like do yall really think we forgot? how the fuck can you just make excuses for the shit hes done, its literally unexcuseable
Order a whole pie - no cut 🐭
Got a feeling that they might get their pizza as frozen individual slices and then put them together. Especially if they sell by the slice? I bet a company makes whole pizzas cuts them up and IQF's [ individual quick freeze's] them. So they aren't recycled that would break soooo many food safety hygiene issues! Many companies out contract their food to sell as theirs.
18.54 you know us so well shane
Yall are out here fucking defending him now?
Shane is a funny guy, but I think he should be more careful. The Mexican "Señor pooh" might not be such a good idea after everything that has happened already😬 you never know how people are going to react
I don’t know but my theory is that they also sell pizza by the slice or half pizzas and so maybe they make a bunch of pizzas all at once in a big oven or make them really quickly one after another and then take some of the pieces for the partials they make or selling by the slice and then sometimes if someone orders one they can combine those pre-cooked pizzas to make a full pizza. But in your original video they were definitely old pizzas
7-11 pizza would have Covid no lie
The pizza would make sense if it was half n half, like they make them seperately and put the halves together, making them so different. Like if someone els eordered the same it’s maybe easier?
"am i a f*cking bear?" KILLS me everytime
Hahahahaha!!!! You had me at Republican!
SHANE! I've missed you and your conspiracy theory videos so much! 💜💜💜💜💜💜🐖🐖🐖🐽🐽🐽 And if nobody has told you lately, you're doing amazing and I love you! Keep your head up! 💜💜💜🐷🐷🐷  Also, I feel completely pathetic for asking but I could really use a blessing if you could help in any way. 🙏🏻
Omg! Imagine a new Shane Food video?!? YESSSS
shoutout to Ryland for teaching me pop culture bc im 19 but still not with it at alllllll
I missed you...
Honestly I stopped watching Shane’s recent videos because I thought they were going to be boring but now that I’m watching them it’s actually very funny and interesting lol
Okay so I worked at chuck e for over a year and the reason why our pizza looks so jacked up is because it’s actually made from scratch dough does not come made me make and stretch it ourselves so forgive us for not always knowing how to make a perfect circle 😂😂
This video cured my depression
I have the og Shane merch 😎
Ryland has the "wtf I'm not even mad, just disappointed" dad vibe with Shane and it's sending me into orbit.
I really really missed you and the videos(': so glad youre back!!!
i have a kill bill shirt too shane
Maybe their trying to say how when they cut the pizza right when it comes out of the oven when it's still hot, so when it cools off they shrink at different rates??? 🤣
Why has everyone forgotten all that has happened, acting like it is okay for him to get away with it.
Shane is the only content creator I actually like He is authentic has a good humour and is extremely intelligent in how he creates his content
Three grown men talking about Rylans pussy 🤣🤣. ❤️. Truly missed it
Lmao !! So funny I love Shane!!
Please post more videos like this omg ?
Oh my god!! I've missed this soooo much! I love seeing Shane happy and laughing. Living for where you are in life right now! In the off chance you read this Shane, we love every type of video you make- because you make them. ❤️ p.s. would love for you to review scary movies!
I would so wear TPE
i love how spiritual shane has become yes
I love you Shane I’ve missed you
Don’t ever quit Shane keep on with your videos!! I missssed youuuu 🥲👏🏼❤️
Lmao I totally get it I am barely 21 and I didn’t think I’d make it this far either😂😂
Was anyone else shook to their soul when they got the notification for shane posting a video? My boyfriend and I were just like Yes Shane is back!!!!
Ryland is an icon. XD
when he made the first video my friends and I went to try it out. all I gotta say is the pizza slaps. idek if I care if it is smushed together. it’s good.
34:13 can you imagine the BEAST STSTION PLOWING INTO AYYYDUBBBS
Monster
Release new videos!! I’ve watched this one 3 times already 😂
Omg cant wait for the podcast. I love you and want you to be back in our lives. My wife says dido
Shane.... When is the Denver Airport Conspiracies video coming out???  I hope when you & Ryland get back to Colorado, you do a whole multi part series on them. ✅ 😉
I swear I have laughed so much at the beginning of this! Love all of them! 🤣
Crumbl is so damn good
No dislikes?? Must be a great video from the not-controversial-whatsoever Shane Dawson!
What about those track suits Jeffery was wearing in those pallet videos when you guys collabed those were hot
Meow
You know what mate, we have your back. I think you’re the only person I can name that can withstand cancel culture. It was not fair that it happened to you Shame, and your fans know that, and your fans are sticking by you, proof is in the pudding. Shane, you will be okay.
10:01 🤣
I just need this type of evergy every day. You hear that Shane???
I missed laughing this much
shane your  a bear
You paid like 26 dollars per pizza…. Holy fuck!
This makes me soooooooo happy!!!
I bought the black and white pig purse :) 🐷 🐷 🐷
Omg I had no idea you posted! I’ve missed you so very much! Love you Shane!!
I love your videos! Thanks for coming back!
Chirstallballs
They do serve single slices. They might shove whats left of other pizzas together, to make a whole “new” pizza. It still had not been served to another customer, but it might not be one SINGLE-MADE pizza (recycled).
You are so funnybshane
I LOVE HIM IDC
Could you bully your partner anymore?
Chuck E gonna retire after diz bit damn Shane lmaoo 😂
Um, are we doing this merch?? #TeamTPE
Id be upset if my fiancé was a little to happy to see Chris like he’s constantly putting Ryland in a spot, Shane you gotta know how this looks
Everyone talking about the past and his past videos. He’s not a god. He’s a human and jokes that cross the line now definitely didn’t “cross the line” back when. His content is great now. Focus on that💚
Wow you had me laughing out loud 🥺 just like old times. Good to see you healing and moving forward Shane.
Ryland was so funny in this one :')
i like how right behind chucky cheese is a whole urgent care
Ayeeee 2022 everyone waking upppp love u guysss🖤
I was VERY disappointed when you didn't ask for at least ONE stuffed crust pizza :(
I cannot breathe
SHANE! 💞 You have no idea how missed you've been. Cancel culture and all of these "woke" vultures are ridiculously pathetic & sad. The entire "holier than thou" attitude is sickening. You got me through years of hospitalizations throughout an entire decade. I fully believe that your humor saved my life.   You're so much more loved than you could ever know. 💛💛
🅿️
I MISSED YOU
ok no but why does the pizza look like that fr. like there are solid reasons why the pizza SHOULD look normally sliced up. other regular pizza places make half and half pizza's that look fine. but not chuck e. cheese apparently. should still line up to fit a circle. can't say "oh it changes in the oven or while cutting it" the pieces should still line up properly and form a proper circle.
Ryland was so over Shane with the traditional or stuff crust pizza 😂
You are a red panda
17:21 pls💀
I missed you sm
Im from Buffalo NY which is like known to have the best pizza in the country.. but i swear that Chuck E. Cheese and 7/11 have the best pizza for some reason. Idk why 😂😩
the funny thing is, i used to not think id be here in the 2020s <.< heh
Fucking love shane
The letter “P” comes from a song called pushing P lol
Shane! I need the sweatpants back in your merch shop! and I would love one that matches the green hoodie, a set like that ♥
We miss you shane
Glad to have you back!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩❤❤❤
Winnie the Pooh is a girl. Js lol
Get a friend to work at chuck e cheese, so you can finally know the truth
Christopher Robin and you were asking if you were a bear gay…coincidence?! 😂
WELCOME BACK BABY! I lost my shit laughing at this <3
Shane: why am always involved in drama 😩 Also Shane: ...this video  😂😂all love Shane. Obsessed w uuu😘😘😘
I'm sorry, how much were thr pizza's
Fast forwarded the entire thing.  Bye
You are so 🅿️ and your videos are 🅿️ to haha. I'm glad you are doing better and staying positive and you should adventure  Disney land! And just elope haha cheaper and also saves u the exioty
i think that they make the pizza then cut it and leave it in one of those warmers so when someone asks for a single slice they have it ready and there for you or if you ask for a half and half they just grab how ever many slices from each pizza then put them together. because if you have ever left a pizza out and reheated it it doesnt taste the same at all
Shane in a truck is crazy weird
I make pizzas and when you cut them they will sometimes move and therefore look uneven. Must just be the kind of dough they use and that they slide the pizza to put it on the box. Its the same pizza
Oh my god.. is Shane the Chuck E cheese of YouTube. A little bit wonky but he’s back bby, cause I’m here for it <3
Been with you Shane for 9 years so happy to see you back and loving life yasss queeen 🙌😍
Best way to really see if they do that is order a pizza and ask for it not to be cut.. and if they cut it well idk what to tell ya ahahaha I’ve never had Chucky cheese
We love you king 🤴 and MISSED YOU SO MUCH ❤️❤️❤️
Hey, okay, well... at least there is an Urgent Care right across the parking lot from the Chuck E Cheese, so after your "catch a ball" you can just go right to the Urgent Care. 😂🤣
OMG I want the money pants! how do I get the money pants!!!!
im so glad you're back !!!
Can a girl get a clown warning ⚠️ Shane lol
i miss this combo so much! welcome back
Being gay is a choice. Sexual lust is not love.
Minute 10:54 killed me!
I love the conversation you had with Ryland and Chris. It's exactly how me and my friends talk all the time. And I love seeing this uncensored side of you
Jesus christ died for our sins. Believe that he died for our sins and believe that he is god and he is kingnow when you can. Spread this message now when you still can.
Ok but why did “Señor Pooh” SEND ME 😂
Maybe they cut before they cook?
HES BISEXUAL?! wha-.
he is funny tho ah :(..
why do i love you sm :) lol your amazing !!!
This was fun to watch lol
THE CHUCK E CHEESE PART WAS SO NOSTALGIC FROM YOUR CONSPIRACY VIDEO ON IT
I’ll be a guest in your wedding 😆
I am convinced me and shane were best friends in our past lives
the amount of ADD is this video lol
*Before you know, you don't know* OK ICONIC
I want pizza now
Someone should sue u for that horrible hairline instead
Skinny shane!!!!
I wonder if it would all long normal if you asked them not to cut the pizza… then they couldn’t recycle 😂
I'm sad I didn't get this notification, but glad to see you back! Can't wait for more conspiracy videos.
Shane is a bear
Quit making Ryland jealous shane! I feel so sorry for him. 😁
The randomness and adhd moments just seems like he never left
So glad you're back. ^^ <3
I WANTED TO SEE THE LITTLE DEBBIE ICE CREAM REVIEW SHANE PLEASE
“Last time we saw him he was a bitch, now he’s a man” as he pulls up in a f150 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Christopher is my guide, doesn't give me much help. He helped me find a side table.
pushing 🅿
It would make more sense that they just have many orders of people only buying single slices instead of whole ones. After they make a whole pizza, cut it up, and put what their customers bought on a plate, they would still have the rest of that pizza left in the kitchen, so would make sense to add more slices to it when other customers order "whole" pizzas, instead of discarding the un-whole pizzas they have to always make a new whole pizza everytime people order.  If that's what they're doing, I like that because it minimizes waste, but I don't know why they don't just say that. Lots of restaurants have to throw out food when customers don't order enough. They use to donate it to the homeless here, but all places stopped doing that after they accidently donated expired food, so now they just leave it in the garbage and let the homeless take it on their own so they don't have to be legally liable.
💀💀💀💀💀
I was laughing from the beginning until the end of this video 😂 We missed u Shane! I am a silent fan, I started watching you on YouTube ever since your conspiracy theory videos I think way back 2015. When you got cancelled in 2020, I believed in you even more after you apologiesed & owned your mistakes. I always check up on your channel if you're back. I also love your 2021 halloween video that's why I am here, I was supposed to re-watch that because I suddenly remembered you, because the last time I checked your channel was December, but you didn't upload until Feb 2022. I relate with you in some ways, especially when you talk about depression & suicidal thoughts & all of that. Me too have been suffering for over 10 yrs. with depression, anxiety, & some sort of personality disorders. Suicide is also a constant thought in my mind. So, your videos are really like a therapy for me. I just want to say those. Although I know that there's no way you could read my comment 😁 Anyway, please continue creating more videos, it really helps your viewers. But don't be pressured, just do what makes you happy & be yourself as you always are. Love lots! Take care! -Cyndi from the Philippines.
🆘🔴SHANE PLEASE READ🔴🆘 How can I contact you ? Is there an Email or a number or literally anywhere I can talk to you? You dont even have to respond but There's something VERY IMPORTANT I need to show you . Its about Children in Tarrant County Texas who are being sexually assaulted ,beaten and god knows what else by their own mother ! I have undeniable Proof I can send you Im just begging for somebody to listen
20 minutes isn’t too fast for pizza, at round table our oven takes 5 minutes  and if we top the pizza fast enough, When I worked there I got pizzas out the door in 7 minutes
Shane!! 🤣🤣 you are hilarious we’d be best friends! So happy you’re back yeehaww
The fact that Chuck E sued tells me that they have some dark sinister stuff to hide. Their animatronic band they always had used to scare me so much.
Oh we get it 🥲
Your humour is awesome, Iove these types of videos as well as conspiracy ones. Much love..❤️
YESSSS
I’ve missed you so much! I’m so happy you’ve come back and you seem so genuinely happy. You were my whole childhood and I can’t wait for what else you’ll bring out!! x
The Queen of conspiracies is back!!!
Shane needs to be canceled like EDP was since they’re both into little kids. The only difference is that Shane was caught in a sting like EDP was. They both have history with underage girls.
Shane I was a huge fan for like a decade, but you never addressed the worst things you did. I hope you've repented to God at the very least. As much as I want to, I can't come back and support you without knowing you've taken steps to work on those things. I wish you'd finally address it instead of brushing it under the rug year after year.
Shane, what I love about you is you inappropriateness. Never stop. I’ve missed your light and warmth and totally inappropriate comments! Welcome back. Never leave me like that again okay? But also lol. Ryland’s tight lady bits. You guys are the cutest.
Never piss off the people who make your pizza. There are secrets under that cheese. 😳
They be cutting pieces clean off the whole pizza with each slice 😅🤣
Everybody finding love while Shane was gone but all I got was fatter and more depressed but now I can eat more and watch Shane again YAY❤️
Love u
You will never be an ok human being until you give the people what they want. Help people in need. You don’t get to be everyone’s favorite creator without giving back to the trans community, black community, and victims of SA and every little girl that you’ve hurt. Disgusting

MISSED YOUuuuuuu
Say ALLEGEDLY after every assumption or put it in the video that this is for entertainment purposes only and not to be taken seriously
Not Shane looking like vanilla ice
Shane, you were very much missed! ❤  This video had me hollering 😂🥰
This is probably crazy af to watch on shrooms 👁👄👁
honestly i love this type of video
Has everyone just forgotten and forgiven this man?.
i think his personality is so funny the way he calls everything out HOW IT IS. LMAO
I think there are four possibilities:  Either they bake all of the pizza slices separately, as in there are never actually whole pies, they just make every slice by itself and then throw 12 pieces together.  Or they do the same thing, but they bake quarters separately (to make it easier to put together into a circle), and then put 4 quarters together, and cut them up into 12 slices.  Or they do bake full pies, but then they cut them up into 12 slices right after, and then pass them along, and then someone else puts slices together into meals.  Or either of these—or they make full pies, but then cut them up into 12 slices—and then they put the thing in the oven again.
the urgent care being right next to chucke cheese lmao
welcome back shane <3 so glad ur back!! can’t wait to see what this year brings you!!!
Speaking of family how's your mom
I love it, i was giggling  laughing, 😃😂😂😂😂 love you 😘
Yassss Shane miss you sm 😫✨
I was sleeping in our camper van and woke up to my mom and step father going at it. I have been scarred since and hate sex lol I blame them totally.  This video made my day and yes I know I'm late to the video.
I haven't watched a Shane video in a few years and OMG! He never fails to make me die of laughter! LMFAOOO
You really shouldn’t make content that tricks the mentally disabled.
I love you Shane pls give us more content
Shane please order a half pepperoni and half cheese pizza and tell them to not slice it…. Slice it yourself and see if it’s really the slicing part that makes it uneven like they say!!!!
Geez - Chuck E Cheese trying to sue you or anybody on YouTube is (just an opinion) really really low of them - just pathetic. But their pizza is totally weird!🤣 - if someone says that their pizza is weird looking etc etc that ain’t a lie - it’s just straight up ‘public knowledge’ technically. 😹😹😹 Man, dem rats.
Ryland is doing a great work eating those pentagonal shaped bipolar pizza slices 🤣…. Love y’all guys 🤍
“Got a truck in Colorado n became republican”😭😂😂😂😂😭😂😂😂😂
We love our pizza, being somone else's garbage.
You should take the temperture of all the odd pieces vs. The fresh pieces...
I have not laughed like this in a while. Keep it up l O l.
i miss shane so much. this reminds me of this old videos. don’t let cancel culture bring you down, queen <3
Pause at 3:16
Please unpin that bullshit from your Twitter now. It's time to move the fuck on 😘
Is so good to see you back!, I would like to see less family members in your videos, It holds you back. Im saying this with positive vibes 💙
More conspiracy videos
YES PLEASE PODCAST PLEEEEAAASSSEEEE
Shane please give some money 😖🙏🏻
Dude  I can't go in the woods in the night in the dark.. I hear cra cra shitz the 3rd Bridge vid was epic
ummm who’s chris?? 😭
I laughed so hard!! TPE. And I can’t wait to see more videos.
I absolutely LOVE the conspiracy videos!!!  You do am amazing job on them!!!
Creepy freak
You do know that the cheese when hot will flow into the creases
But what does P mean and pushing p😭
7:49 cant lie, i was about to leave (as a straight man) and that just hooked me man
ryland blink twice if you need help
I haven’t laughed this much in a while🤣 oh how I’ve missed your videos!😊
I swear I'm watching a day diary of a thruple rather than a documentary.
I absolutely LOVE the chucky cheese pizza conspiracy!! Its just so fun to think about, i hate that they tried to sue. I wanted to go see for myself and also take the niece to play but put off by them suing tbh. Hes not the news he's a youtuber for fuck sake 😆
ayeeeee
ONG - Shane ! You Did NOT just poke at that Angry Dog ->🐁<- Again ? God I 💖U 😎
Welcome back Shane. Love ur videos!
They tore down my Chuck E Cheese in Arvada, CO to make room for shitty condos. I'd rather have the rat and his crappy pizza. RIP.
This is why white ppl should stay out of black ppl business P is for pimipin something they clearly don’t know about
i missed Shane :,)
I feel like all of his videos are just him and Ryland shopping and throwing their money around. They're annoying to watch.
Maybe it's just laziness and wanting to not let pizza go to waste lol...like they cut up pizzas to sell individual slices...if someone orders a whole pizza and they have leftovers they just put the individuals together to make a whole pizza...does that make sense?? 🤣
didn’t we cancel him? 😅
Yes Shane please do a podcast! I would so listen! I have been searching for a podcast to listen to and I would 1000% listen to yours!  Fan since 2009
Ha. I did a school project on the whole chuck e cheese conspiracy
I feel like one of the only Shane dawson fans that never lost hope in Shane I’ve always been a fan even through the controversies. I still to this day don’t know why people don’t like him because I literally only go on YouTube I don’t go on any other social media platform. But idk love you Shane stay strong please continue to make content I need ur content. I should add nor do I wish to know the controversies.
😆 I though ryland was about to kill you! 😆
petition for stupid videos like the old food videos
“We’re friends”😂😂😂, enjoyed  this video.
😂😂…”why is she green??…
they sell frozen chuck e cheese pizzas at my marianos in the frozen pizza aisle
How big are the hoddies I really wnated a mystery 2xl but it was out of stock so I've orderd the xl and I'm worried it won't look right I could not find the  measurements online, Great video I'm so glad you are back 🥰

Next vid Shane turns straight
I’m SCREAMING at the Chuck E Cheese disclaimer…the back and forth wording…I remember when Shane talked about this conspiracy YEARS ago - LOVE it
Wow. I haven’t laughed like this in so long. I missed Shane Dawson!
34:05 slick with not trying to get a lawsuit 💀
Y’all need to stop😂😂😂
awesome
this video wasn’t 🅿️ when they was talking bout 🅿️
It's bagged and boxed pizza like the school lunch kind comes in. I'm sure they have made to ordered toppings and fresh dough for unique orders.
I'm so glad I never liked pizza so when I was a kid I didn't eat it :)
Lolzz we made it! 😳
Oh My god I FVCKING LOVE YOU AND I WISH WHAT HAPPENED NEVER HAPPENED AND YOU NEVER LEFT ngl I missed you more than my dad
Shane, don’t stop making videos, especially the conspiracies. Even though many people left and are still not over your past, there are still many of us that want to see your content. So keep doing your thing 🙌🏼
U guys r sick
This has brought me back to the time when life still had some.... Life to it. Everything has been so serious and depressing and condescending the last few years it's so good to get back to this
I miss u guys shane fuck all these losers
Got it!!!! But I tried it on my daughter and little sis and didn’t work. Maybe it’s only on adults??? 😳
Skinny Shane u loosing weight awesome boo
Chucky cheese is gone now around where we live
Awe...I'll go to your guys wedding! Dont be sad. =(
I’m still confused as to why 3 pizzas is $80? Lol
i missed shane sm. it’s weird, i procrastinated to watch this. but i’m glad you’re back!
Tbf, I don't care what Shane has done. The guy is hilarious without even trying.
I was laughing so much that I couldn't breath for large sections of this video, lmao!!
Omg I freaking love watching your videos  🥺❤️ I watched them since I was in elementary school
So Happy to have just seen you're back! Your videos make my day 💜
Christopher crumbls!
Does Chuck E Cheese sell single slices of pizza to customers? If so, they maybe put all of those pre-made single slices and make it into a whole pizza. Thats the only thing i could think of that would make sense 😂  Im so happy to see you’re doing well, Shane! ❤️ your loved by so many!
I currently work at Chuck E Cheese we don’t recycle it’s just the dough depending on how it’s rolled or stretched on the pan😂
if you weren't rich you'd be rotting in jail
I saw you posted a conspiracy video and started crying now I’m watching anything else I missed I’ve been watching since I was like 10 and graduated and all my friends dispersed and it destroyed me to loose you… when you did the eye thing like yoou know what I’m talking about I felt that and I missed you so much Thankyou for being my friend again cause that’s what it feels like I’m crying now
In the beginning when Shane first pulled up in the truck and started talking I was thinking holy crap he changed and is some what "normal" now. Then a couple minutes later I was like, nope nevermind.
there is an urgent care right behind the chuck e cheese for when you're done eating
i luv uuuuu i miss u  m happy ur back
I know this might mean nothing but I just finished watching your brand new conspiracy video that ended with the tower of terror being turned into Guardians of the galaxy ride. And as soon as I resumed playing this video you said guardians  of  the galaxy……..
Holy ballsacks. I've missed your videos so much! Don't ever sabbatical us again 😭😂😭
shane, i just want you to know that we are so proud of you for coming back. thank you for making my childhood full of amazing videos. love you
Omg Shane I just love you so much! I literally laughed out loud at like 2am and probably awoke the household 🤣
shane always make people feel happier <3 thank you for your videos.
Taurus Ryland be like…,”can i have another Pepperoni?!”
Y’all, Chris is fine. Very sad that he’s gay and older than me 😢
Shane next time order the pizza not cut lmao just order a whole pizza so you know it’s fresh!!
UGH, forever and always Shane!! 🦸🏻‍♀️
Is this video hard to follow for anyone else? I feel like it’s all over the place
I've missed you so so much ❤❤. Don't ever leave us again 🙏.
Republicans love you though Shane just saying lol ♥️
im glad you came back i missed you
Man fuck it, everyone makes mistakes! I’ve always liked this dude. Everyone deserves second chances and I hope he gets it
i can handle all of the other fucked up shit shane has done, but comparing himself to the icon winnnie the pooh is where i cross the line. watch your fucking back shane
Please do a podcast i miss shane and friends so much
Hell yeah, he's back! I missed Shane's humor.
Bro the only reason why Shane is on this predicament is because of the ppl he has exposed but you know what we know the allegations are just an excuse to take him down because Shane is searching for the truth N by the looks of it he's finding them thus making him a threat
"Like" this comment if you want Shane to make regular Mandela Effect videos.
I found the Chuck E. Cheese's stuff so entertaining!
Missed you Shane!! Love watching your videos, they always make my day!!
Hi
Finally I'm glad to see your back
I think  it's time to become BILINGUAL! I'm learning  spanish!!! Oh amd shane u don't have to get married in a suit & u can elope! be like britney!!!! 👍🏻
Bro Iv been watching you since 2013 it’s so comforting seeing you post again. Hope all is well!
SHANE STILL LOVE YOU !!!!!
Glad to see you back, Shane. Thanks for being you. In all your ups and downs. Thanks for sharing.
omgggggg!!!! your voice is different :C
papa bear is back!
As someone who works at Chuck E. Cheese, at our store we for sure don’t recycle pizza it’s actually cause we use a rocking pizza cutter and it sometimes makes uneven slices if you don’t center it correctly
I can imagine when it's a half an half pizza, they make 2 tables pizzas at the same time (1 margarita and 1 pepperoni) and then take one half of the margarita and put it with one half of the Pepperoni. Things could get muddled when moving them into boxes or onto plates! Obviously doesn't explain the full pizzas but it could explain a half and half
Shane I just want you know that I love that you are making videos again because you were the first YouTuber I ever really watched and I love ryland too !!
As Chuck cheese files another lawsuit 😆
I wasn't going to watch but omg 🤣🤣 #TPE
you should talk about back rooms
The joy this brought me ugh I love yoh
Clearly not bisexual 😂😂😂😂
I would genuinely buy that house but I’m broke af 🤣
The disclaimer every time he says something about chuck e💀🤣
Love Shane’s outfits!
As a parent who has been to Chuck E Cheese’s soooo many times, I have a theory. They have a buffet. They are constantly cooking pizza all day. The pizza is fresh BUT it’s not necessarily always the SAMEA PIZZA. Imagine they have someone order a half and half. They have have a Pep and a Cheese ready so they cut in half and you get half of each. The rest goes to the buffet. It’s not “recycled” it’s repurposed 😂. I do not for one second believe it was previously on someone else’s table but I also do not believe it was originally all ONE PIZZA.
ew this was gross. yuck
this is such clickbait lmfaooo
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Shane... hate to tell you but most of the Marvel fandom is very gay (specifically for Brie Larson and Scarlett Johansson)
I watched this last night and then meditated on intervention, asking whoever was “controlling” me to intervene in my life. I just started this job and today was supposed to be my first real day but then my mom started throwing up blood in the middle of the night and I had to bring her to the hospital, therefore missing my first day…. kind of creeped out.
His disguise is so overt it's covert 😂
I miss your videos you need to come back 😣
Shane I thought I would say you look amazing! Don’t worry you don’t look like a pig, keep positive I’m loving the vibe!
“WE MADE IT CHUCKY!”  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’s been way too long!  I forgot how much your videos would just brighten my day and make me genuinely happy! I say new merch would be amazing
These are my favorite kind of videos 😭
Your humor makes my day so much 😭
Ok coming from a New Yorker that pizza is deff oddly shaped and you called them Out and they hiding now 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please upload regularly Shane... that would make me happy
All we want is u back making videos ❤️
Apparently the chuckecheese stuff is bc they have a blunt pizza cutter bc safety for children or whatever and it's super hard to cut so it like takes out big chunks in the middle of the pizza
🅿️
At the end of the day it's not a conspiracy anymore it's fact, and the pizza is still fucked up,I said it not you!
22:10 we too old for the internet love
A Shane Dawson video...... Basic (catchy) Title...hour long..reaches topic 40 mins in..spends whole 40 min prior rambling off topic asking what he was saying..reaches topic..video ends......with more rambling..haha
18:55 same bro same
10:00 omfg wig snatched
Maybe they cut the pizza before they bake it so the crust gets uneven?
Chuck e cheese has a standard and procedure for how they do things. But employees also have their own tricks and methods for how they do things. ..........😶
Shane congratulations on finding your way back. I honestly thought you would have crumbled but you found a way back to your feet. Good job sir. Now don't fuck it up!
Please just stop keep the legend that u were this is horrible
Missed you Shane !! ❤️ Your videos have always made my day can’t wait for u to keep uploading them .
its the urgent care in the background for me
We made it shane and we've all learned a lot. been here since basically the start glad to see you woke up 👁
I'm not even done watching this video unfortunately YouTube turned off my notifications for you I had no idea that you would actually uploaded a video I saw that you made a post saying that you were going to come back sometime last year but this is my first time I actually sent you a video after I finally saw a post on your Instagram and I decided to manually check out your channel on my own anyway I'm glad that you're back and I'm literally dying laughing I'm not even done with the video yet this whole video there's so many jokes I feel like I'm watching the old you from back in 2008 and 2009 you might not have planned to do this video but I like the randomness of it I like and the natural conversation and jokes it reminds me of the days you used to do random skits
Wait I’m sorry, there is WAREHOUSES full of the merch I’ve still been trying and failing to get my hands on ever since… WHAT? Then why is everything still sold out…
I missed YOU thank you for this video 😍
Missed shane’s videos 🥰 — welcome back!
Shane is always a great distraction, when you need a break from the simulation.🖤🖤
So Elope if you don’t want a wedding? Or have a really casual small family wedding and don’t stress about what you are going to wear? Idk just suggestions
Shane:  "btw in my dream... your vagina-" Ryland: "tight."  LMFAO 😂😂😂😂😂
SHANE: if you want to do good AND a podcast, why don’t you interview people doing good things in there community? Who cares about celebrities and their ridiculous lives who don’t make the world better but in fact breed self hatred, makes people feel their life isn’t good enough, body image issues and oversexualize everything and offer no healthy or happy ideas.  Be different. Make the world better by highlighting the better people.
they use a wonky cookie cutter!
PIZZA RAT! 🐀
Omg how’d he know people have his shirts to goodwill 😭😭 I work at goodwill and managed to cop one ❤️
I’ve missed upclose random shots of Shane’s face 🤣😭
HAVE A CHUCKY DAY!🔪
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6cM36Cm27U
SHANE ON DMT VIDEO PLEASE!!!!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏...
Biiiiiiii
Yeaa now we just need to get Jenna back on and maybe the world can go back to normal… or the way it use to be.
if u need help from Shane Dawson, u just need help!
cuz that's what the world needs, another fukin podcast!
yeah there's totally no quid pro quo to the Chamberlain coffee thing!😉
u know how pigs are known to HONK?😕
2 words Shane: PRE NUP!
have a feeling that dude would cut it off to stay with Shane!
ppl like Shane are Republicans, but they're too brainwashed by media to know it!
so glad to see you guys back this made my day im so happy :)
Please freakin do it!!!!! Pleeeeease!!!! Podcast, silly videos, reviews, haunted crap, everything!!!!
gave it to goodwill💀 called out . sorry shane
“btw ur vagina” “ tight.” - ryland
WAIT, WE'RE NOT MAD AT SHANE ANYMORE?! I can watch him again woooooo! Also, welcome back
My new modo!!! TPE!!!! 😎
Love you, Shane!!!
Like legit fucking got half of it. Like wtf it just came to me out of no where. Omgggggggggggggg.😂😂😂😂
Oh my God I havent laughed so hard in awhile. Thank you, Senior Pooh!
I'm glad he back tbh ... We all have done wrong for sure I've topped sum shit ... But I'm so glad he's here 😻 yay he's  back again ☺️
Ok so I think what's going on with the pizza is that yeah they might have a big slicer that isn't that great, Ive has to cut pizzas and keep going over them before so I can see that. And with all the pictures I'm seeing where half is a different size is half pepperoni half cheese. So I'm guessing yeah it's 2 different pizzas but they probably have a cheese and a pepperoni pizza and cut it in half and use the other half for someone else who wants half and half
I FUCKING LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!
And wait who makes 3 pizza in 20 minutes. Domino’s takes 20 minutes for a small
Who orders CC to go lol? This is like ordering strip club food to go.
I think that they sell just slices somtimes. If thats the case its probaly them taking some of the slices from pizzas that are incomplete and putting them together to sell as a full pizza.
80 DOLLARS FOR 3 PIZZAS?!
How did I miss this!! Finally you came back. Tonight you were gone for good
Shane, I enjoy every single video that you create. 💗 A Chuckie Cheese pizza is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get!
Why the fuck are y’all being so friendly  don’t forget the shitty things he’s done
Nobody wants a new conspiracy video 💀
All the disclaimers about Chuck E. Cheese had me dying 🤣😭
Man I would watch him do stand up!
"... losing the str8 audience......... OMG MARVEL MA R  V V V V EL!!!"  LITERALLY HAHA.
Shane: "We're losing the straight audience... uh MARVEL" I, a gay marvel fan: *ceases to exist*
I just watched the new Ultimate Conspiracy Theory video and whilst watching it thought 'I would love it if Shane had a Podcast.' Then I put this on after 😐😐
I love the truck Shane 😊
I remember gerit use to talk about marvel and shane didn't care, now Shane's the marvel nerd and Ryland doesn't care
pov the person in your brain keeping you awake at 3 am to watch this video
Fuck I miss the old Shane Dawson when he didn't give a fuck it was awesome
refreshing his channel every second rn
iM WAITING FOR NEW VID
WHERE IS THE NEW VIDEO SHANEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
well it's 5 and no new  video
Like 2 min left till new vid
Waiting for the new conspiracy theory 👀
Something I DO know about making fast food pizza... Is sometimes when you cut the slices, bits of pepperoni or toppings can come unstuck and jump off on and around the cut.  Not saying this is or is not the case with Chuky's but it is a thing that happens 🤷‍♀️
How can one fall asleep while watching Guardians of the galaxy that shit is fire the second one is so sad as well
Im bi to
Shane, Why are you being so rude to Ryland? Seriously! He’s so sweet and has an awesome soul. Count your blessings. Love you both. Fun watching your videos 🌞🌈💞
No fucking way these comments aren’t moderated somehow, no way this many people just forget about how fucking disgusting Shane was.
I love this video, we miss you Shane
Might as well just turn around and head to the urgent care in the same parking lot after eating that pizza.
Idc what anyone says Shane is and has always been my comfort YouTube, his videos made me feel happy when my life was at its lowest.
I’m so happy your back. I always watch your older videos with the squad and a part of me miss those :(. Welcome back Shane!
To play devils advocate maybe they cut it before they cook it? If not yikes
This was exactly what I needed. I love and miss you Shane <3
ok wait. when i was little maybe 5, 6 or 7 i would always think are we like dolls? bc we play with dolls and role play and stuff but are people playing us? that’s what i always thought
“We’re losing the straight Audience” 💀
I'm just here looking for your brothers channel
I love how there is an urgent care right next to Chuck E. Cheese and no one is talking about it lol
As I was watching your stuff from years ago, I was wondering if someone sued you for all the theories and stuff......
Love u baby
i’ve rewatched this so many times. new comfort video 👏🏻
SHANE WE FUCKING NEED YOUUU 😭😭
Im 10 minutes in and still have no clue what is going on 😂
Yo, I hated Shane for what he did in the past, but I'm still sitting here watching his videos.😂
"Oh it's looks delicious" was the best line !
Are you gay?
Wow there's actually people supporting this paedophile
If I was Emma if have an issue with how much they mentioned the coffee lol
Ask them to not cut the pizza when ordering that half and half and then see what happens 😂
Shane you are probably having those dreams because you want a baby so you inate reaction is to be “drawn” to female reproductive system. Your body is not stupid and knows the difference between assh*le and vag*na. 🌱😉
shane's video's have been the biggest comfort for me for such a long time. i think it's annoying how anything against him were things he never continued doing by his own will. all of the drama came afterwards while he was already a person who was changed by themselves for the better. love u dude❤️
I’m so happy
shane, focus on yourself, not what everyone else has to say. i’m glad your back babes<3.
Literally made my night! Missed you Shane!!
P
🌸
Someone did a video on the pizza too and it said it was like the pan then it gets all weird when they place it in the pan it messes up they just like fall
So funny!  And made ME want some Chuck E Cheese!  😋
We made it!!!!
Hey miss your videos
Yay you're back! Don't let the cancel culture and the monsters get you down!  <3 Diane (Kim's mom) PS You kids want more glitter? 😎
I LOVE YOU VIDEOS I GREW UP WITH YOU!!
sooo... ig yall just forgot everything he did huh.
when are you going to try to help Eugenia? after making that documentary with her, and seeing where she’s at now, not a good look for you to be doing nothing about it
🧍🏻‍♀️💀
“But in the meantime, here’s something you _don’t_ want”   Me: Interesting…
at this point i hate ryland more then shane.
always deleting comments right sis
Shane literally rethinking his life after opening the pizza hahahaha chuck E cheese conspiracy 2.0
I miss Shae Nae Nae
I find it really odd that you can’t find any negative comments on this video and all the ones that come up first are just people praising Shane for doing jack
“made me republican” lmaoooo 😂😂
What we wanted is for you to disappear forever, so yeah, entirely not what we wanted.
Shane I’m just wondering why have you been gone so long
I'm curious if they cook the pizzas whole and then when someone wants half and half.. the just slap half of cheese and of a pepperoni into a box and that's why they look like they come from two different pizza... just saying that would make sense but dumb if they do that..
They sell pizza by the slices lol,you ever thought that maybe they do put pieces together    from ones they have precut and not left overs from peoples table? Lol y’all insane.Theyre obviously gonna try to hide that too because it’s a way to save money that I’m sure is frowned upon.
Damn, I was really hoping someone finally got your ass for the pedophilia/bestiality/racism stuff, oh well, there's always next time!
Cant wait for your next conspiracy video. I will stan you to the end actually think your hot too hahah x
I watched this video high and got scared. Shane is such a narcissistic human…why are y’all supporting him
27:42
Order a pizza that is not cut and see if it still is misshapen  and just formed together with cheese
It’s the urgent care behind them when they try the pizzas for me
speaking of podcasts- i swearrr ive been relistening to them for the past 6 years like from 6th grade till uni now for god its gonna be such a treat to hear new ones!! (miss jessie tho :()
I'm so glad you're back, I really needed laughs friend🥺 Love you guys so much❤❤
“ it’s the same day recycled over and over”
I'm 3 weeks late i didn't get a notification but Im so happy he's back 😭 Watching this the moment i'm done with work
“Can I call you Christopher Robin” HAD ME ROLLING
he's literally wearing a weedshirt
gosh i'm so happy he's back!! he literally saves my day with his humor and laughter i've missed it so much! idc what he's done in the past he's owned up to it and said sorry for years what else can a human do? the whole cancel community is pathetic like y'all support way worse people than shane and even when u hate on em u still watch their content sooo..?☕️
💥Bi queens 💖💜💙💢
Is hard not to like Shane I been watching him for years. Sarcastic, full dark humor, relatable, funny, awkward. Now Ryland? Idk if just him in general. He is annoying asf 🤣trying hella hard to be someone he ain’t.
I’ve really missed your videos. Completely opposite of my cisgended life as a 52 divorced woman. Not even sure if I’m using this cis term correctly. But you make me happy!! Glad to see you creating and uploading!
Chris: I havent has chuck e cheezes sinces I was a kid.  Shane: and thats why youre still here.  😂😂😂😂😭😭😭
YOUR PODCASTS WOULD BE SO ICONIC (: I’m so happy you uploaded this video
I think Chris should get hired in Chuck E Cheese ('s?) and see what's the realiTEA.
🅿️
I still love you shane lol. I always have
ry is MEE , when it came to the pizza “ can i have another slice?” 🤣🤣🤣 man i just finished your vibes i love you 3000 🫂🫂
Oh man I haven't laughed like this in a month. Feels so good to watch Shane again 🤣🤣🤣
and put me on that wedding listtttt !!! 🫂
shaneeeeeeeeee , omggg ive missssssssedddd youuuuuu so so so muchhh 🫂🫂 im glad to have you back into my lifee . you really are #1 still 👑.
Thank you for coming back 🌸💛🌸💛🌸💛🌸
I love ❤️ it
Idc what everyone says I will forever love his videos no matter what
who thought not cancelling Shane was a good idea? Pedophiles belong in prison
The second pizza on the slices that has a gap on it, you can tell it came from a different pie because of the cheese that isn’t cut in between the slices. That means they cut it and added cheese or they combined another pizza and added cheese to make it look like it’s fresh
I miss you Shane 💚💚💚
Goofy ass 💀🙏🏾
SHANE AND FRIENDS!!!!!
I guess that’s just America
Eww
It’s Ryland for me😂😂👏🏻
he got cancelled for predatory behavior..not just saying the n word. Wtf are we doing.
Conspiracy videos about quarantine babies please, covid,  living in a simulation, anything! Miss the conspiracy videos
why are people happy ur back???
I wonder if for the half and half  They make two different pizzas and then just put two halves of two different pizzas
YAY SHANES BACK missed your videos so much
imagine fucking cats... so cringe
sued by cheeto
“Buyyyy my Merch” bitch that bag is 80 bucks no thx
Wait so is Shane back on YouTube?
your place is in prison, not on YouTube. why is no one realizing that he should not have a platform
Everyone makes mistakes and you’re the only one who would experience this much scrutiny because you were the father of everyone problematic in the world 😂😂 in a good way. And people just went way to far. You’re okay. You do you Shane. ❤️
hide your cats guys
I missed you so much shane
I’ve missed you Shane 😭 I was smiling the whole time watching this! You’ve brought so much light to my life.. much love
The one that turned you gay 🎤
Absolutely lit. Enjoyed this so much. This is how I remember you Shane. Glad you are posting again and just being you without any limitations or doubt in yourself! Growl bear Growl! Hahaha
nice to have you back Shane, even after the first few minutes of the video you seem so much happier. Im here for the non-self depreciation, we love to see growth, welcome back 🙈
I was hoping you'd never came back to yt tbh, what a shame  :/
Alt title: Ryland not having a vagina and Shane simping for Chris for 43 minutes and 22 seconds
Its been 3 weeks Shane. LETS GO BITCH
Vaginas are the first 3-D printers lmao omg i’m so sorry
Pushin 🅿️
Doe s anyone have a close up of the mermaid picture in the beauty room or know who it’s by?
Thank you Shane, I missed you! 🐷
here's a conspiracy theory: Shane's an alternate  😂😂😂
Wohooo good to have you back shane!
gay
You need to talk to Eugenia Cooney and help her
not me noticing the urgent care behind them after shane was like "consult your doctor before going to chuck e cheeses." 😂
The jokes are still funny🤣
I’m so happy your back, I love youu
The Disclaimer tho Thanks for coming back Shaneeeeee
Missed you so much your my favourite xxx
TPE!!!!!
I love how Ryland said he used to snort when he laughs n hasn't done it in a while. Even tho he did it in the beginning of the vlog haha 😄 Shane Always "honks"
I could.litterally just watch you guys do nothing n I'm still entertained . Also a missed opportunity- Chris Crumbles
Idk what the Shane drama has been, but I still like him
The thing is...he might not seem like a good person to a lot of you but.....his content is gold
Did I skip a chapter? What happened to the old camera guy? Loved him 😁
Feels so good to watch this video of Shane’s, I felt like I was watching his old videos. 🥰
how did we just forget about stuff he said about childeren and animals? bro you can't just get a platform after what you did being an adult.
I don't get the people who are canceling Shane, he isn't the worst and his mistakes could've been made by all of us. It's curious to me that people like Logan Paul and Co are still present on YouTube when what they did was way worse than anything Shane has done.  so to all the people criticism him, look at yourself and maybe think for yourself what Shane has portaited us all over the years VS what Paul family did. he changed throughout the years while others don't. most people in here hating on Shane are hypocritics.  mucho macho love for Shane and his family ❤️❤️❤️
I missed yall so much!
Iconic
Nobody cares
Idc what you guys say. You guys can bring back whoever you want but not Shane. absolutely not  Y’all need to do a background check on everything EVERYTHING he’s done  R*cist, kidlover 💀 They might forget  But not me
Video idea: Having a shower ?
We made it #2022
Do you want to reach out to Eugenia Cooney again?
Why would you disguise yourself in your own merch 🤣🤣🤣 when they all dressed up in his merch omg that got me 💀
I already knew the half and half was gonna be a mess😂
TBLG
All o’fuck.

"Christopher Crumbl" should be his nickname!
I love the urgent care right behind it

Yall made my freaking dayyyyyy!!!!!
I'm so glad you're back 😭😭❤️

Hahaha I’m here for this content 😂😂
HE DELETED A VIDEO FROM THE conspiracy theory... OMG!
I can not wait you til 3/15 for the new conspiracy theory video. I got goosebumps when I watched your reel on Instagram.
Is Shane problematic? Yes. Is Shane EXTREMELY entertaining? Even more yes.
CHRIS CRUMBLE
Needed this, like desperately. So glad you’re back shane❤️
So my dad worked at Chuck E. Cheese in 2014 so this information may not be accurate to today, but I think so. He said they never recycled pizza (and me and my dad are really close so if they did he’d tell me and I’d tell you right away 😂😭) he said that the reason it looks that way is because sometimes workers will get lazy and cook a full cheese and a full pepperoni and put a half of the cheese and a half of the pepperoni together for a half and half pizza. He also said the big cutter that you guys mentioned is true, and that they take the pizza and take the cutter and just constantly cut it until there’s a good amount of slices. So sometimes they do come out smaller or larger cause they just spin the pizza in a circle and cut it with a huge cutter. Hopefully this helped, it definitely helped me find out the answer cause this one was one of my favorites. 😂😭
How is this guy not arrested. He's a nonce
Please do a video on the back rooms.💗
This shit had me cackling
This honestly was very entertaining and I very much enjoyed this
My internet is too slow right now, but I will definitely be back to watch this. 😍
Shane we love youuuuuu!!!
😺😺😺😺😺😺
Thank you for posting again.. cured my depression for the moment ❤️
Señor Pooh 😂 good to have you back Shane
Poor Ryland
I love you so much Shane!💕
We get it and we made it bro
Shane awesome
We need to stop giving this man a platform
I just watched this  Me: 🤡
I love this trio
1 minute in and this is worse then when i shit my pants while barfing into a plastic bowl with a fever of 110. Worst day of my life but this is definitely worse. Man has the humor of a wet sock except for at least the sock can stick to walls, unlike his jokes.
PLEASE DO A SERIES ON DAVID DOBRIK LIKE THE ONE YOU DID ON JAKE PAUL
The fact that there’s an urgent care behind Shane while they’re trying the pizza 😂
Do a conspiracy theory on meet Dave a magazine cover of Brittany spears shaving her head in on there pls
Tbh my theory is that they make all cheese pizzas or all pepperoni pizzas, or whatever other kinds they have; and when someone orders half and half, they just cut half a cheese pizza and half a pepperoni and heat it up together. And sometimes they’ll have two halves of a cheese pizza left over, so theyll put those two halves together for when someone orders an all cheese; if that makes sense. Certain places have pizzas sitting out in warmers for a bit and when you buy a slice they just take it from those, so it would be kinda like that
Omg. Stopped watching Shane a hundred years ago... Came back only to find out he became the same fat man he was a long time ago. You should have never body shamed so many ppl in the past...
I missed him.
He's lost a heap of weight, def what he's eating is giving him energy inside and out. I wonder what happened with Jeffrey and him tho??? 🤔
I miss your videos I grew up watching you your amazing sending love
Honestly even when he was cancelled ive missed him so much, im glad your back shane. i missed seeing the family :((
I miss you
urgent care being located right by chuck e. cheese does NOT help their case
Missedu cuhh 💝
instead of getting you into a lawsuit let’s get you into that chucke suit
No p is pushin P 🅿️
TPE = Total power exchange
As terrible as he is, he’s never wrong
SHANE WE NEED A CONSPIRACY DOCUMENTARY ABOUT EVERYTHING GOING ON IN THIS WORLD 😭
the we've all been waiting for
the lack of hate comments saddens me
I’m just happy you’re making new content.. youtube is just not the same without you
baffles me how people just forget what he’s done and what he’s like. the moment he posts again and all of the sudden it’s like nothing happened. disgusting.
I’m new to this channel and i really loved this video but especially the haunted ones 🤩😁
Nice video 😂♥️😂
chucky cheese pizza is $30 😃  no.
I was good up until he made a joke about being a republican
YouTube did me dirty and didn't notify me that you posted a video. Well, I found it anyways. I'm looking forward to you slowly coming back. I've honestly missed ya. Even though you most likely won't see this (didn't get notified) you bring a smile to my face Shane.
Hi Shane  with a truck 💜.  Glad you are back! Looking forward to more content. Been toooo long!
As someone who worked there, if anything the employees eat your leftover slices in the back because we aren’t paid enough to eat, pay rent, and generally survive 😂
FUCK YEAH SHANE IS BACK BABY!!!! WOOO!! I love Shane's personality so unapologetically sassy yet humble and truthful about himself and his insecurities I can relate to that 💕💕
Love you and feel everything you’ve gone through! Put in the work but let yourself be free!! We missed you king!!! 🅿️
The part about Emma 😂😂
Is it possible that they make the pizzas.... Sell a few single slices out of the pizzas.... Then puzzle piece that sh*t back together when somebody orders a whole pizza? **still thinking about it**
It could shrink due to it cooling. Same idea as homes during  summer and winter where some doors get stuck then in summer oh its easy to open.
You were so worried about posting and thought everyone hated you, but Look, Shane... It's been almost a month. 3.4 Million views and not one single dislike. I've been with you a really long time, and I am so happy to see you thriving and loving life. Keep doing what inspires you!
So uh, why are you hiding the criticism? Already back to doing shady shit Shane
You gotta earn me back 🤨
Idk why but I like this video 10x more than your come back video and your last few videos !! You seem really you and happy here ! Love it :)
Y’all should go again and order an unsliced pizza and see if it’s actually fresh 🤔🤭
I died when Shane said "you gave one to Goodwill" cause i am currently wearing my Shane Dawson blue pig hoodie that i bought at Savers for $10 =)
Make the tight pussy energy merch today lmao
You’ve come back to save me just in time lmao
Maybe coz people order half and half they mix halves with other halves and that’s why they don’t line up
I am so beyond excited! I finally got the opportunity to order some of your merch for the first time ever! I have been watching your videos since high school and it’s kept me sane and always kept a smile on my face! I was so upset when you were cancelled and you stopped posting videos so I’m so happy that you’re back! I can not WAIT to get my handbag mystery bundle and I can’t wait to see your next video! Thank you for being you! 💖💖💖💖💖💖
oh it was so funny! shane you 're the best , that sense of humor you have is really a gift ! love you!
Shane you have me cracking up 😂 The one thing we do know is you’re getting the surgery come on let’s go!! had me rolling🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️😂😂😂
What is happening in Ukraine? I ask you to find out the truth and help
🥰
Nice family vlog!
“We verily created man and We know what his soul whispereth to him, and We are nearer to him than his jugular vein.” [Ap Quran, Chapter 50, Verse 16]
These comments have got to be bots lmao there's no way anyone still supports this fucker
yea phycics or whatever are real man. The bible warns against coming into this world of mediums and phycics and witchcraft. It’s 100% real just God warns us several times in the bible to not do so.
i missed you so much
Still waiting on more videos!! Miss you.
Chucky Cheese probably had something to do with Shane Dawson being cancelled
Glad you’re back now if we can just have Jenna Marbles come Back you two are my faves!! 👍
I can't Shane haha Hadn't seen you in AGES but I thought, hey I should watch that video that came out a while ago, saw that it's an hour long and thought well let's just watch a bit but here I am still laughing after watching the whole thing :D your sense of humor just cracks me up so much haha Love it
I wonder if Shane & Ryland ever discuss Shane's bisexuality & how it impacts their relationship?
this was funny. as for the pizza, doesn't it retract when it cools?
I love watching Shane, he's very entertaining. But the camera operator must have smoked a huge blunt before this. He WON'T stop laughing at EVERYTHING!
Dear Shane love your conspiracy shows you need to do one on rando nautica I believe the group Bohimian Grove are behind all the spooky shit that's going down they having some creepy experiences espesialy Jasko need to watch his shit
I love the begging of this video because it's a scene of a conspiracy theory video
I’ve said it and I’ll say it again Shane Dawson would’ve thrived in the stand up comedy world!
we love the new truck !!! (you coulda got a ram though man)
sex talk with shane 😂
I really missed Shane don't fucking care what the haters say !!! I live for Shane!!
When Dawson is a vile abomination against god
It’s giving forceful humor vibes and this is not what I came here for… sad
THIS IS SO FUNNY SHANE I WAS DYING LAUGHING THE WHOLE TIME!! so happy you’re back:)
It’s okay Rylan! I have been engaged to my man for 3-4 years ( I lost track of time ) lol. I love him with all my heart and it does not mean I won’t marry him. Wedding planning is just stressful along with all the attention. Shane loves you with all his heart and plans on spending the rest of his life with you. He is in no rush because he sees the long term life with you. This small moment is not long when we think about the 50+ years he plans on spending with you. Enjoy the engagement! You are absolutely enough and perfect for each other . ❤️
Glad you’re back!
Missed you Shane! Love you! You are the bestttt!❤❤❤❤
Instead of trying to sue Shane, they should fix their pizza. Shane literally tried to give them another chance and their pizza is still messed up. Shane even googled what's really going on and he still couldn't find an answer that made sense. I really wanna know what's really going on with their pizza lol
Shane! Look up Matpat's food theory about Chuck e cheese! He talks about this. Apparently it's all wonky because of their pizza cutter.
Been watching your videos since I was 8, I’m 22 about to turn 23 this year :3 I love you so much Shane
I really hope you don’t wait too long to get married with ryland
Love Shane, no matter what. I wish he would come back to LA for good.  That’s my hood in West Hills my Target and my WalMart.  “We’re Pizza inclusive!!!”  Hahahahah
P means money in British slag
WHERE DO I GET THAT BIG BEAN BAG PILLOW COUCH THING?
ohhhhh brother THIS GUY STINKS!
Shane I love you
I'm glad he is back
girl give us that conspiracy video or im never resubscribing
Yikes people really support this predator???…
Ok but why is that cheese pizza slice sooooo much smaller than the others
miss you shane!!
the video is hilarious ! love you shane !
If growth were a person
This was boring...... DISLIKE!    Need a new camera man..!!!
I didn't realise how much I had missed you until I watched this video. It's so good to have you back man. I feel like this was like catching up with a friend I haven't seen in years.
Moist
Love you Shane so glad to see you back in action.
Welllllll, I miss your poppin cookin days.
i wasnt subbed anymore because then i always had expectations of a new video.  i like to randomly check back and be surprised.
I have a lazy eye and can't wink for shit 😂
I love you shaaaaaannneee FUCK I missed you omg!! 💗💗💗
My theory on the pizza is that they make a full pizza of each. And then when you order half n half pizza they piece them together. I don’t think they’re recycled lol
STOP UPLOADING.
I call there reasoning for this bullshit. I’ve been to many pizza places and none serve deformed pizza like this. They can deny it all they want but no one is believing them.
I didn't watch the full episode cuz Ryland was cring at the beginning...he get worse longer into the video 😬😬😬
I definitely miss your food videos iv watched Every one of them
Confused and late… who the hell is Chris? 🥴
Reginaldo Erick
Omg I miss your videos so much!!! I'm so excited
shane pushin 🅿️ love his videossss
I missed Shane Dawson. I know the things were said about him were bad, but hey, we’ve literally given everyone ( famous) a second chance
ANSWER
DO YOU STILL LOVE LUCY
SHANE
I've missed him so MUCH. Being able to see him happy and making content again just makes my day! Thanks for coming back Shane xxxx
Yessss
I dont know if anyone is interested in this but i think you should make a documentary about nikado avacado honestly, i remember you made one about Eugenia with her anorexia. I think think it’s about time someone speaks up about binge eating.
I’ve been watching your videos since 2009 I’m so happy to see another video 😭
This really did make my whole day :) it’s so good to see him back, and seeing how much he’s grown, yet he’s still Shane :) we love you Shane and we are all glad to see you back!
I love Shane ❤️❤️😂😂👍👍he’s hilarious
shane looks kinda nasty ngl
I used to watch your videos religiously, it started back in my freshman year in highschool back in 2016. I ended up meeting a friend who also started watching your videos with me. We would binge and start from the beginning. Making slime, laughing so hard we cried. Bought your movie “not cool” binge watched it way more than I probably should have. Well my friend passed away in 2018. So watching your videos was a way I got to hold on to so many great memories. I was very sad when everything happened the way that it did. I was devastated feeling like another part of my life had died. When you made a video a few months ago I started to weep because those memories started flooding back. It was like she came back to life all over again. I don’t think you realize how much you’ve impacted lives. Even still to this day. I will always support you because I know that you are a good person. I feel it in my heart. I will always be here to watch your videos and support your creating lifestyle. And I will count down the day you start making films.  Love you Shane ❤️
I love me a long Shane video😩🍿
We love u shane I missed u so much
Literally a long cancelation & a pandemic & still talking about the same thing, Chuck E. Cheese’s pizza.. lol
What I need to ask is WHY do you people like conspiracy theories relating to a certain company. I don't think you realize how damaging those can be. I mean, RECYCLING SLICES?! Come on. Sure. Chuck E. Cheese filing for bankruptcy WAS inevitable, with the 2.0 rebranding, the pandemic and a decline of interest in arcade games, but YOU just sped up the process, and I'm TIRED of these. Next time, you should probably, CITE YOUR SOURCES!
People actually still support him 💀
IF I WERE RYLAND I WILL LEAVE SHANE FOR GOOD, HE DOSNT LOVE YOU RYLAND POOR YOU..
All the way from Saudi, thank you Shane for being you
🤢🤢🤢
why tf my video stop at 31:47 im tryina see the dang pizza
we did make it . ❤️
Been rewatching your older videos on youtube, glad to see you back. Couldn’t stop laughing:’)
ok but are you pushing p
the chuck E cheeze reunion is HILARIOUS 🤣
I needed this today, thank you.
i’ve rewatched this like 500 times and it gets better each time 😭 we’ve missed you shane !
Post more ! Love your videos ❤️
I fucking love you shane, you can make anythinga funny. But i cant sit threw another ghost series. I rather chop
Some 6 yr old probably sneezed on those pizzas
This is unwatchable dude. Like seriously wtf even is this video💀💀
Omg please call your podcast “Canceled anonymous”
Don’t care
Literally see only 1 comment talking about Shane's past "situation" what is this comment moderation?
Shaneee theyre gonna sue youuu
I missed you
You know what... Im not gonna lie here but if shane uploaded daily and had 17 ads I would be happy and watch every video just because I'm so fuckin bored
love how when ryland is dying in the back carseat from the chuck e cheese theres an urgent care center behind him
Im pissed! Ive been subbed to Shane since the begining and I went to his channel and I WASNT SUBBED BUT I WAS SUBBED FOR A LONG TIME. Why was it not subbed that's stupid. I'm sorry Shane i re subbed even though... I was subbed to you before. Anyways love you
Ngl the music and the honk of the truck went very well together lile i thought it was part of the music. Also thank god another video cause makes the boredom go to hell
doing ketamine and watching this was a trip
Nothing brings me out of a funk more than a Shane video😅😅
Literally made my day
Shane please buy the same pizza cutter Chuck E Cheese's uses and make your own pizza and cut it  to see what happens. Lmao
Nice track more manly 😜
Ngl for Halloween Shane could be Pooh, Chris Christopher Robin ofc, and ryland can be piglet!!!! 👀 (please tell me that’s cute or am I stupid)
Go back into hiding we don’t want you here except the ppl who for some reason accept pedophiles
I missed you 🥲
WHY DO YOU FORCE A SNORT AFTER EVERYONE OF YOUR FORCED LAUGHS?
I just found you that you don’t have your skit videos anymore 😢 where aunt Hilda, those videos were my childhood !
I've literally linked this video to everyone I know because Shane's videos have always been hilarious yet you still bring up important topics. ❤
When he said "a mix" I lost my shit
Pretty lucky for you the dislike count is hidden nowadays.
You know damn well you're filtering comments cuz ppl haven't forgotten your bs
you helped me through sm a couple years ago and i’m falling back into where i was then and i’m really excited that i’m gonna have my comfort youtube back:)
Help Pearl Harbor help me shane!!!!!!!!!!!
We don’t want these videos though.
Gross
shane is my comfort human
Hi guys! vlog idea! SNATCH GAME :) :) that would be soooo good seeing how you guys would play 😇
So either Chuck E. Cheese recycles pizza, or everyone showing evidence of it lied. Or a jillion people noticing and showing that Chuck E. Cheese recycles pizza slices is just a conspiracy theory by Chuck E. Cheese?
Shane didn't negatively affect Chuck E. Cheese's sales... people not wanting to eat recycled pizza did. So Chuck E. Cheese needs to sue everyone who didn't want to eat recycled pizza.
If a pizza restaurant doesn't want their unhealthy practice exposed on the internet for millions to see, then they shouldn't do that unhealthy practice. THEY should be sued by OUR government for the unhealthy practice.
I am fucking crying watching this right now 😭 and probably sound like I’m dying to my family 🤣
Shane I started waching your videos since I was 18 now I'm about the 30's with no instant of regrets watching your videos I really admire u!! You are the BEST!! So glad to have u back!
Ok, so l-let's say, hypothetically, for the sake of the argument, that, perhaps, I, Ben, were to ask you, Stacy, to the prom, right now. Now let me ask you, in that situation, would it not be in your best interest to say yes? I mean the answer is obvious, right? Now let's suppose, that in fact, I was doing so right now, in this room. Now, hypothetically, what would your response be?
This is me. This is the shape that let others recognize me as myself. It is my symbol for myself. This is, this is, and this is as well. Representations. Everything is merely a description, not the real myself. Everything is simply a shape, a form, an identifier to let others recognize me as me. Then what am I?
love you shane i’m happy you’re back :)
The outro of the video tho- AmAzinG
WE👏WANT👏MORE👏
They should use Randonautica for a video. I’d love to see Shane freak out over that. Couple kids found a body in Seattle because of that app,
Yes 🙏🏻🙃🤗 something fun to watch instead of news and Putin ... Hello from Sweden 💕
if we’re in a simulation the person who controls me must hate me bruh
I love this man for his imagination and the world he creates
I’m so happy your starting to make videos little by little again! Your videos help me so much when I’m feeling sad and need a little distracted from life! I love your sense of humor too it’s like mine so it’s even more enjoyable 😂❤️
10:22 I litterlly snorted at the same time as Shane 😂😭🐽
Is Chuck E Cheese even getting enough business to have spare parts?
Gets cancelled for things he once joked about on his podcast "Shane and friends"  Takes a long as break from youtube.  Comes back  "I WANT TO MAKE A PODCAST"  God shane all love but that had me DYING
Alright see y’all in a few months
i’m not glad ur back
Sooooo everyone forgave Shane huh 😀
You need to marry Rylan because he is freaking awesome and he puts up with all your craziness. You will never find anyone like him ever again. Oh and by the way you can tell he is totally madly in love with you. If you don’t marry him there’s something wrong with you
i can't believe there are still so many people that support this freak and are anticipating his return to youtube this deranged man belongs to jail
Shane!  THIS HAS TO BE SAID. you are soooooo much better than that dumb guy pengiunzo.
SHANE I MISS YOU!!! LOVE YOU fam. Have fun enjoying life 😁😁😁😁
I definitely missed shane. Tbh he knows his mistake and hes growing for them. It sucks that he has to be very careful abt whos name he talks abt. I love shane.
its good to see shane posting more
No one would miss you if you were to disappear shane
I laughed the entire video
I really do hope there will be more conspiracy theories coming soon lol. They make my day
This perv is still pumping out content? What a world 😅
the employee meant like the cutter they use is like a foot long n is looks like the blade of a guillotine. every other pizza company used a pizza cutter (the small round hand held one) so that’s why the pizza is so messed up?
Shane and the camera guy ship them now lol ryland like the third wheel
Wow so everyone just... forgot?
Shane please stop feeling like you need to take accountability for your comedy, I highly, highly recomend people like Ricky Gervais and Don Rickles and Rebel Wilson, Franky Boyle. So many more, they all make the most outrageous comedy and none of them have had to take accountability, except Franky Boyle and i highly recomend a show called Qi, Sandy Totsky is genius and Ghosts the British version. Please keep going with comedy, you have it in you. Theres also s big shout out to Youtubers TFIL, the overnight channel as some of their members have now taken to pubs and clubs doing comedy. Your a clever guy and i loved your series, admittedly i eant to see more diversity to, but keep going Queen, you and Ryeland are perfect together and im glad your doing the things that make you happy. In all faurness people dont realize also the reason you did those documentaries about the white Youtubers is cause how probalamatic they wherr becoming. So just goes to show its grilling white people in a way. So thanks for all your efforts, your amazing. X
your content is more for americans i think, i am british and this sort of content isnt my thing but every deserves a second chance.. glad to see you back.. i can tell you are a good person deep down
I can't be arsed to watch this entire video considering Shane's behavior around minors and animals, so to anyone who has seen it in its entirety: Does Shane mention that he's an empath?
He looks older now
Hey Shen,if you watch the pizza slices they are mixed up,they cut them and they chance slices order that is why they do not fit,look at the salamy slices to see that the slices are in random order
40:09 jokes on you, I have premium
I vote Chuck E. Cheese’s let’s Shane in the kitchen to make his own pizza and debunk the conspiracy
You guys are so relatable to the relationship my husband and I have. I’m watching this with him like omg remember when I had the dream that you had a vagina!?  It’s not just you lol
Please drop another video, somthing addicting about your videos. Idk if its the editting or your jokes im not sure.
Also buzzfeed has a video about this and they show the process of how it's done lmfao
You need to check the pizza with the pepperoni because it will cross over on 2 slices and you can see if they fit together like a puzzle… I don’t know if any of that was clear lol but yeah
Here's an idea, make a pizza, and cut it with the same kind of pizza cutter they use, and see if their reason is true because I think it is
shane dawson is a bad person tho
I'm so happy.. just gotta say.. I needed this and it's wonderful. Thanks Shane. Been watching you since the beginning, back to like ho-dini days.. yeah that far back. Well anyways, I missed you along with everyone else here in the comments. ❤❤❤
lol shark tank 😂😂
Weren't you canceled or smth?
I have missed your videos so much ❤ honestly use to get me through the day from the conspiracy video to the food and hanging out with Rylan videos like I'm excited!! YouTube has been boring without you
frumplepigskin
The last time I watched this guy he was taking his mom to Disney world or something...
Shane I'm not a follower nor familiar with you other than seeing portions of your in depth video on Eugenie....I want to like you I feel but word is out there your are not a cool guy and this video doesn't help.  Can you help me find something in you to believe in?
Y’all I’m sooo excited for the Shane comeback and takeover. MISSED YOU SOO MUCH SHANE!!!
Pizza
Do I agree with his past absolutely not but like you can’t stop people from continuing to make content like love or hate him he’ll make content. If you hate don’t support and don’t watch ect. If you do great. Havnt supported this man since everything came to light but this popped up on my ish and I just had to put my two cents in and … goodbye !
The pizza looks completely normal
It was amazing and I love seeing you so happy 😀
I MISSED YOU SOOOOO MUCH IM REALLYYY HAPPPYYYY
this … like most things you create has zero substance or effort. 🥴
You need to do stand up comedy!!!!
Perfect,  you're absolutely perfect!!! 💯 🥰nothing but love!!!
i have a theory what if we are parasites and we are controlling our bodies
please make more content you and your family bright up my life, idc about the haters.... ever since you vanished i missed you and your goofy jokes.
Did everyone just forget about what he did?.. huh.... this is why D'Angelo shouldn't have deleted his Shane Dawson video.
If your watching this video you get it. Lol yeah.
Fuck the fake people that left I'd attend your wedding 🥰🥰
Shane Dawson is hilarious 🤣
If I had a player in my brain… I don’t think they would want me to be watching conspiracies about ..  them
I always was a fan of shane and always will be
You should test foods with Covid tests. A dr in South Africa did it at the night of the plandemic, he tested, avacado,mango etc…they came back positive.  I was like what the actual fuck. Just an idea.
Chris laughs too much, it kinda feels like I'm watching a David Dobrik video.
Your pushing 🅿 lately
Shane ….Did you get funnier or am i just still drunk ? I’m dying at this whole video
15:05 *cancel IT* I DIED, LEGIT. IM DEAD-
So what happens when your lit ?
Why is YouTube allowing someone like Shane Dawson to have a platform when there's evidence (or was because it's all been deleted) of Shane's repetitive behaviour of beastiality, black face and paedophilia up until 2018.   Go watch YouTube Reuploaded's video the rise and fall of Shane Dawson
I know Shane likes to have time to edit his videos so even once he's totally back on board with doing them that we won't get them as often as with most creators.... but I'm very much looking forward to at least maybe 2 a month?  That wouldn't be so bad would it?  I've really missed Shane's videos.  I'm glad he's in a better place now.  Did Shane make mistakes as a young creator?  Sure... but so have a lot of people.  At least he owned his and has worked on making changes.  The "hoard" went way overboard with punishing him.  So many others have done worse and never answered for it.
YES BRING THE CONSPIRACIES BACK
I’ve missed your brother
Did Ryland just say that he paid $80 for 3 large chuck e cheese pizzas......
Can you order a pizza uncut?? And I’m glad your back 😊
Shane dawson, your amazing. Don't stop making videos please. I've been watching you since I was 12, im 22. That's 10 YEARS. You were my distraction through some tough ass shit. You gave me motivation to say whatever I wanted when I wanted. You helped me have confidence.  Sorry you got caught up in the drama. But don't stop!
Hair is looking healthy
like on God he talked about people doing stuff evading stuff despite who they are at their base core and given examples he legit is no better than the people he trys to expose it's just different when he ended up in the spot light
this a stunt everyone look at the comments he is liking only his friends/ VERIFIED people
Omg please replace the camera man… he’s so annoying. He’s ruining the new videos.
Look up murder with my husband podcast I think you should do an episode with them !!
CONSPIRACY VIDEOS!!!!!!!!!!! ❤️
enjoy it all!  make my days so much better!
37:44 ryland is a furry?? =0
Tbh it's hard to support knowing what I know now. I know that they're rumors but I can't get the thought out of my head, this video made me miss life before covid.
So u can get sued plz u don't like the place what happen to freedom of speech.
3.3 million views and only 164k likes. Thank god
Ryland is trying so hard , to make sure no ones is getting sued , over Chuckecheese . Or whatever you spell it )
SHANE IS PUSHING 🅿️
Chuck E. Cheese make frozen pizza now you can buy in stores. 😂
long break just to get striked
I literally watch these videos any time a panic attack is coming on to distract myself and prevent it from hitting. Thank you for helping me through the worst of my anxiety. I love this video.
I laughed through this whole video, missed him so much.
Shane, the stuff you said and did previously went way over my head because it was typical millennial humour. Gen z are a bit dumbfounded by our humour but I am also thankful for them calling people out I guess. Times are different. It's tough. So glad you're back shane you're so nostalgic.
Literally missed his videos! I would be so down with daily uploads 😂😂
I love Shane’s ADHD in this bro 😭
I like the change on the content make more of this!!!!
you'll be just fine with whatever you decide you want to do. looking forward to a future podcast :)
Theres literally an ad every 4 mins. After writing this, in this 3rd ad Im closing this video and am never coming back. Gave him a chance and he ruined it smh. Hes lucky the dislikes are blocked
Hey, Shane. When you start back your pod cast and interview porn stars, please interview Jenna Jameson (I hope she says yes). Her past is very sad also her health. I just really think it be cool and I can't wait for your conspiracy theories.
Still waiting for him to acknowledge that he groomed a little girl on camera.
love the editing style keep posting!
I make home made pizza all the time. One massive pizza at a time. Even after days in the fridge in gallon bags the slices still fit together perfectly. All pizza shops cut pizzas on a cutting board, so that doesn't work.
I have never been happier to see a notification on my phone
Love how he’s deleting all the hate comments lol. Can never take accountability
What’s the name of your psychic
Lol me waiting for you to cut back to the beginning scene with your brother!! 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀 Love you Shane!!!!! 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
How much you wanna bet Shane is deleting all the critical comments
When I used to work at a pizza place. I remember it would get crazy busy. Pizza almost falling out the oven. I would cut the pizzas super fast just to move on to the next. And my cutting skills were beyond terrible 😢 the slices were not even.

I love your brother but I don’t think we are in a simulation or a video game. I believe we are normal but we are going to be able to live through vr worlds like sword art online. Just because the science is there the proof we can probably use are brains and body to control.
Wondering. If you order a chuck e cheese pizza but ask them not to cut it. If they will still cut it or just decline your order.
Welcome back
i love how there is an urgent care right  in front of chuck e cheese
Shane I know you don't know any of us. I hope you get this but please help Eugenia cooney she needs help you helped her once but u got to help her again its gotten bad
Hey, shane I am not sure if you will even get this... but I remembered you helped Eugenia Cooney out but she has gotten really bad can you please help her again. I am not sure what to do. I just can't watch someone as kind and caring as her die.
I missed you :c
YAYYYY IR BACK
Wow
I remberd an old video of yours and went back to watch it and I missed you like literally I cried when you left but the account I used to watch you on got hacked but idc cuz your back!!!!
Is Shane new thing house tours ? 😭
Also, if you cut a pepperoni pizza and cut through the middle of a pepperoni, when you put the slices together the pieces of pepperoni fit to make a whole piece. But their pieces are completely mismatched. And the burn patterns on the cheese pizzas is the same. They cannot be serious 🧐
He’s BACK
It’s MORE like - returning to the scene of the crime 🍕
I really do love how Shane is always making jokes about stuff in his life. Lol sometimes humor is a great way to get thro life. ❤️😂❤️
I will ALWAYS love you & your work Shane! ❤️✨
i really wanted to see if i could move on but i was just so uncomfortable watching this. Also, the fact that i couldn’t see anything but extremely positive comments was very frustrating. even the best people get criticism.
If Chris needs a partner to also have arguments about whether or not our guests will all leave us for the wedding - tell him to hmu
they cut the pizza to early so it shifts and then cools
Also you're glowing Shane! Love to see you that happy, you both transmit good energy 🙈🤗💞
What is he doing back here on YouTube . Humanity is truly lost , huh? Oh , well…
Yessssssdss finallllllyyyy your back
Are you pushin 🅿️ tho? 🤔
Shane I missed you so much! But even after some time, I still love you. You're video is awesome and make sure to take the time you need 'cause the real fans will wait for you<3
I miss you Shane. I hope you will upload more
ew
This so strange bc I been think of Shane lately and I said I wanted a video and look now
But where’s the half and half ???
Is it just me or can I hear Shane talk like woody from toy story 💀🤣 love you Shane
1:25 Ik what I was thinking
missed this a lot actually!! hope you guys go to disneyland and do more adventure-type vids( also food reviews coming back right?? ) so excited for u shane<3
glad to see you back to having fun and making jokes
So, so happy you’re back!! I missed laughing with you guys. ❤️
Shane’s the best to watch while you’re stoned asf 😂
Love ya videos Shane!
IVE WAITED 3.YEARS. i love you
I don’t get people these days, so sensitive not like he doesn’t still make great entertaining content. He’s literally a legend.
Shane Dawson is the BEST
Do a video podcast too!
I haven’t laughed this hard in so, so long. I love you Shane!!!!!
I missed you Shane!!
Shane Dawson! I just watched a tiktok, I know I know you don’t get on it no more. Anyway I seen a very interesting conspiracy about how the old coins facing one direction and the penny being the only one a certain way. Well supposedly this years coins face a different direction. Idk kinda dumb probably won’t do it but pretty interesting to cover.
Great work!!!! Get to the top quicker > P-R-O-M-O-S-M !!!
The past is in the past I love this mans content
Love you so much <3 we’ve been waiting for you!!! :D and miss you so very much <3 I’ve been watching you for over 9 years now hehe
So he fucked an animal, groomed minors and did a bunch of other disgusting things and Ya'll are just gonna pretend none of that happened?!
I missed him so much
Watched it from start to end & laughed the entire time! @shane you’re great!❤️
Shane became Jasper lol
okay but where could i get that huge grey bean bag chair!? i’ve been looking for one
Everyone in these comments praising him and thanking him for coming back are just as pathetic as he is.
Stay gone
Omg you didn't learn the lesson ik laughing 😂 😭 💀 dangerously
❤️
He do not care
i’ve been watching shane since he started making videos. so what, probably over 12 years ago? y’all are gonna tell me  if you had a platform for over 12 years you NEVER would’ve made a mistake? glad your back shane, and clearly other people are too.
currently isolating cus i have covid and this video is what I needed. thanks for saving me from going stir crazy :)
the intro is so chaotic I love it
Wait where is the other camera guy???
Shane needs to make more conspiracy theories in reference to COVID 19, mass shootings in schools, ect. The psychic twins are being monitored by the FBI so they cannot post anything. Shane, however, can. 🤪🤪🤪
Gtfo of youtube
I just got really into listening to podcasts again after like a 5-year break. So excited for yours!
my GF worked at chucky cheese in 2004-2005 and the PIZZA THING IS TRUE
I MISSED YOU SHANE I JUST FOUND OUT YOU WERE MAKING VIDEOS AGAIN AND IM HERE FOR IT!
God I missed you
Shane's videos are still great no matter what! His sense of humour is cool!
Please go to Disneyland.🥰😭❤️
apologize.
you've made a mistake. confront it.
stop making excuses.
aint no way this mans haven't been smoking while in Colorado. The whole first half of the video he sound high as hell 😂
dude shane has got to up his adderall dosage because i’m 15 minutes in and he’s changed the subject 30 different times and i still don’t know what the main point of the video is

the pizza reveal had me rolling
After having 2 kids during the pandemic, i have found myself feeling so so alone, and I sit here and watch all Shane's old documentaries to make me feel better. I love you ❤. My 2 year old has learned the tongue click also 🥴.
Chuck E. Cheese said sustainability before anyone did
2:54 IM CRYINGGG
So I sort of remembered you existed a week ago, so I've been slowly watching your content after you took accountability for your actions. It's sort of like we now see 2 sides to you. Instead of how you were 2 years ago, where it was high energy camp "I'm a youtuber" *gasp*, I feel like now you have a genuine side that we see. I like that, I enjoy that side of Shane. You seem healthier mentally which is great, just don't propose on both knees again, that image still horifies me
It means they selling hella 🅿️ounds of weed or coke or anything type of drugs that what it means but people that don’t sell drugs thinks it means they a 🅿️laya or a 🅿️imp 😭😭😂
My ex worked at chuckie cheeses and I asked him this and he said no it’s not true
I DIDNT EVEN KNOW THE P THING WAS A THING
Lol yup, we made it.
🅿️
Did you seriously make your cameraman wear a mask? DB
🖤🖤🖤
everything I needed a more.
I want the bird clock in shanes house ; where can I get it !!!!
Shane, i have used your content as a source of comfort ever since i was in middle school. i love you endlessly and that will never change. you  are a pure soul with a pure heart. thank you for making us feel less alone i love you.
How is Ryland eating pepperoni. I thought gay ppl don't eat meat.
So glad that you haven’t lost your sense of humor
You’ll probably never see my comment, but on the off chance you do- thank you for coming back. I’ve been watching your videos since I was a teen. I’ve been watching you grow since Fred is dead! Lol. That’s a LOT of growth. I’m so glad you took the break to work on yourself and come back better than ever. Keep working hard because it’s paying off. Thank you for everything and every hard time you’ve gotten me thru. I’ll never forget when you said maybe instead of killing yourself, kill the part of you that you don’t like. I love you. Try to keep your head up.
So glad your back ❤️ keep your head up
Keep your videos coming Shane! Lots of people still need you! ☺️ Thanks for all the laughs for many years! 🙏🏼
Ok bro
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I WILL ALWAYS LOVE SHANE DAWSON
MORE CONSPIRACY THEORIES
Not the "what happened in your childhood" line 😂😂😂😂
wtf is this? You are aware the pizza looks all chopped up because they are sold by slice not whole pie.
He is soooooo back
you're great
The fact that i haven't laughed that hard for idk since i was born, speaks for itself!
We definitely made it lol. Maybe what that employee meant was because the cutter is heavy they move some of it around when they cut it and don't put it back together 100% the way it came out of the oven 🤔?
Yo if what the fist 53 seconds of the video is right…. That player is fucked up
*Chris breaks glass*
Guess who’s back  back again
I think everyone forgot all those pedophilic comments and acts...  And all the black face... 😐
Did they move back to LA?
Stocks go up in chuckee cheese because all of us want to see their mismatched pizzas.  🤪
Shane, I'm so glad your back. I've been watching your video for so long and you've always been my comfort YouTuber❤️
It's bc they don't make the pizzas half and half they're two separate pizzas lol they just put half of one next to the other
Thank god Shane's back. Honestly tho
hey Shane, kinda random but i was wondering if you can do a conspiracy theory video about the death of Michael Jackson? plz
I love u so much Shane. Thank u.
I AM NOW FRKN LAUGHING AT 2 AM
I'm glad your back. Thanks for the fun . :)
Shane definitely use to honk.. I don’t remember when he stopped doing it but it was a huge thing I took note of lol
I honestly don’t know how these pizzas come out looking like that I used to work at a pizza shop in unless they are cooking the pizzas without a pan I don’t know how this could happen
I just watched all the marvel movies too!
I feel Ryan is slightly annoyed 😅
sure in the past he has done some pretty bad things but SOME people change in my opinion
Yes bring the podcasting back!!! You had the best podcast ever ❤😭
I don't like Shane but his videos are always a good time.
Love all the content SHANE!!! Please do a podcast!! 💜💜💜💜
These comments gotta be fake💀💀
2:20 woah
If we are a simulation why does the person playing me make me lay in bed and smoke puff bars all day
❤
So glad you’re back Shane!!!!
Terrifying how a Youtuber can do truly unspeakable things, take a 4-months break and come back as if nothing happened.
Have on unexpected guests. Like Jordan Peterson, Yeonmi Park, Paul Stamets. That would be VIRAL AS HECK.
In love with your humor, Shane! So glad you're back  💕
Me who goes by chucky ( the killer doll not e. Cheese) not knowing how to handle shane saying my name multiple times. 😂😂🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Shoulda stayed gone.
Shane please release a conspiracy video or a scary video. Your vlogs are okay, but I miss watching a well put together video about a topic or multiple topics. 🙂
Why is he back he literally sexualized children:/
Shane.. oh how I’ve missed you. I cant wait for the podcast I’m PUMPED. Much love thank you for all the laughs<3
god i missed these videos, good to have you back shane :)
I really wish you would upload more... I truly forgot what I was missing.
all these ppl in the comments are white
youre not wanted
i’m SCREAMING over the fucking pizza what
shane midson
ur weird for the baby thing
The O'Reilly's to "Oh Oh Ryland" KILLED MEEE!!! 😂 😂😂
shane your so funny and talking on cheese really got you close to court
Maybe next time you order from Chuck E Cheese, try asking for a pizza that is uncut and see what they say.
I worry about Shane and Ryland sometimes IDK why
I get it “19:00”
Omg this was so funny!! The first half in particular had me rolling!! 🤣🤣
Laughing so hard right now 😂😂😂
strong strong clickbait omg
Hahaha P came from the song pushin p 🤣
Omg not Shane’s office being trap! Literally Ryland tripped in the same spot Chris did in rylands vlogs!!! Lmao run guys it’s a trap!! Love you Shane baby 🤣😘
Shane, Ik you may not read this but I made an acc so I can make this comment. Shane I’m so glad your back online I have been watching you since I was 6 years old I’m 12 now 6 YEARS!! Idgaf what ppl say about you. You need to keep going and never stop. I’m glad you are doing your vids again bc I love your vids and I’ve watched all your vids about 100 when you went afk… ILYSFM Shane never give up
This shits so boring
i would wear it
uno got big lol
I saw someone say they think Shane and ryland are gonna break up soon cuz of the way Shane was treating him so bad in this video… where are you guys getting that from when was he being rude to him??
Shane will be so successful if he gets into a calorie deficit looses fat starts making moneyyyyy witch he already does and be daddy
A whole different meaning to a RATS test 💀
Why is every comment welcome back shane we love you? I used to be Shane's fan too and not gonna lie I miss his content. But not taking accountability for his actions and staying off YouTube until everyone forgets his scandals doesn't cut it for me.
You definitely should keep the house. Seriously I would love to have a house like the LA one..... 🍕 Looks good.
I found your channel when I was a freshman in high school and to this day still your biggest fan! Love you Shane. Thanks for the LOLs <3
This is the hardest I’ve laughed in a long time. God I missed this 🤣
Please post more videos! We miss youuuuuuuuu, i miss you old food videos too but im so excited to see what you have for us!! Reviews, vlogs, podcast, eating, conspiracy theories, whatever it is IM HERE FOR IT!!!
We need a Joe Rogan, Alex Jones, Shane Dawson podcast
Missed you Shane!
Wtf is this?
Too much camera man laughter tbh
“I ain’t gon be there” lmfao phucken same

Shane pushing 🅿️

Yooooooooo Shane look way slimmer let’s fucking go! 😎🤙🏼
Shane I’m so happy your back on YouTube. my sister and I really enjoy watching your videos together. we rewatched all of your older videos and laughed our asses off <3 and I’m so glad your much happier now
I have something in Colorado you should investigate!!! It's a cult called the emissaries of Divine light and their headquarters is sunrise ranch located in Loveland Colorado
pedophilla
The voice in my head tells me to get up early and excercise but I don't, instead I open up til tok and aimlessly scroll while wrapped up in a burrito in my tortilla blanket.... So jokes on you player one 🤣🤣🤣
damn, some of y'all are real quick to forgive and forget.
God I needed this! Thank you 🙏🏻
Don't drink the koolaid I, mean dont eat the pizza😏
hi shane i am your biggest fan and i always whatch your videos... i have a youtube idea you can read your comments or you can whatch your first ever video...
we still love you
I want food videos lol
Yall can say what yall want yall KNOW yall miss Shane’s video.
you need to be held accountable for your actions
I seriously can't believe Shane made another Chuck E. Cheese video lol
Shane's laugh♡♡♡♡ I've missed it ♡♡
i am going through the roughest point in my life. about to go to mental rehab. seeing this post brought me so much comfort. Btw, when you crack a joke, you dont have to get scared about getting cancelled. i saw you say"no just kidding" you dont have to say that.
19:00 I get it
Shane is back . . . . !!!!!
Are you not cancelled still?
This video is so odd. It kinda hurts my brain and my heart. I used to love Shane's content but now it feels so weird
Dude dont propose if you dont wanna get married... Poor your fiance
I think they cut the pizzas before theyput it in the oven, that is why they look different when they come out
will forever love your content !!! ❤️❤️❤️
No ya in comments excedpting pedophilia ew that’s literally sick
Could you order a pizza from Chucky uncut? 🤔
Okay. We need a new damn video. Come on now!
People change and Shanes have taken his chance and used it for the better. Can’t wait for the conspiracy theories, I have been waiting for years, watching the same old videos over and over again.
fat
How TF did some of the people in these comments just forget about EVERYTHING HE DID
Thank you for being here for all of us fans!!! We have missed you, and you are helping us get through the tough times. Love you so much!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I love your videos Shane u are awesome 😎 and I like how u brought chucke cheese back lol 😆 hope there’s no lawsuit.
I get it. We did make it. Thankyou Shane ♥️
The person you hear in your head isn't actually you that's just your ego.. Highly misleading !
THE URGENT CARE IN THE BACKGROUND THOUGH 😂😭😭
L comments
They remind me of the couple in modern family and Ryland reminds me of Mitchell with eye rolls
I low key missed your videos. I enjoyed this vlog.
As a viewer from years ago, I shall say it again...Welcome Back Shane, I shall be doing Vids sometime soon and I Aspire to one day make a Video WITH YA! That'd be chill af! Love Ya and Love the Vids dude, keep up the good work!
I love Shane!
im so happy you are back !! u always have my support
Ryland is Amy Poehler in Mean Girls at 11:09 lol
P.s I didn’t watch the whole video when I commented but I almost peed myself. “Didn’t you used to honk”..”what…😳”  Bahaha I’m fucking dead 💀
Awe I love Chris he is the sweetest! I can’t imagine how much money he’s spent on crumbl cookies these past few weeks 😂 you look great Shane, and i know Ryland will think you look amazing in your suit on your wedding day!
Who can’t get enough of this guy!?  I’m so happy your doing better. You look great.  Love you always! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️☺️
I know this pizza was meant to be a comedy bit but I just found it stupid and immature is this really the best content you could think of ?
MORE VIDEOS PLEASE
with knowing shane’s past.. i did know small parts about it all but those times were where he wasn’t that grown enough and that mature, though it’s common, many many young yt celebs have had similar things to shane’s past and they’ve grown from it aswell and owns up to it, (tho not all do) what i’m saying is shane wasn’t the only wrong person for it. when things were coming back at him i still was a fan because he has grown so much after those years and does take accountability for those things he’s said and done.   i’m just proud he keeps moving forward knowing his mental state has had rough patches, he’s still going!   I’m proud of you shane, an i will always be a fan of yours!
I think the reason the pizza is weirdly shaped is because the employees eat some and the give it to people btw ily 🤪😎
Their pizza is good, just a little greasy. But eatable. 😄
You having podcast again will be great
bruh I dropped a spoon on my chair once and it was completely gone
hate shane if you will, you've got to be honest "we never got past a guest list because all our guests left (us)" is god damn hilarious
Bro said the n word and his apology is "depressed"
MAKE MORE CONSPIRACY THEORIES!!!
Stay out of YouTube
what I would give to spend the day with shane and Jeffreestar <3  So glad you're back !!!!
what happened to Ryland's left eye? bruised
missed u shane
Use this comment as the dislike button.
Who’s the camera man?
Why does he always try to make Ryland feel bad and jealous?
I like your brother please make more videos with him.
The cancelled anonymous podcast idea was a joke but I think it could be really entertaining. Stars that have been canceled or have fallen off or just lost popularity/relevance being interviewed would be so interesting. "Where are they now" type content but add Shane's humor, it would be so entertaining
ask for your pizza uncut, see what happens haha
this was great haven't laughed like this in a while not even my pills make me this happy lmao pls make more!!!!
I e always loved you. Even when everything was hot and everyone was against me I still loved you 💕💕💕
Why is he coming back like nothing happened? 🤢
Maybe the cut it before they bake it? 🤔
im sorry if you dont wanna hear this comment im an analytic andy shanes sub count goes down 55k a month i wish he still had 20m subs but never happining
You are still funny and I enjoyed this video so much. I haven’t laughed this much in a while. Thank you!!!
Reply to mamamax’s video and make a vid abt it. You need to be focusing on bigger things than this shit.
Shane's pronouns Chuck.E/Cheese pizza
This shit is hilarious
I really want pizza now
Shane and Chris are the type of friends who purposefully make your parents worry when they call to check up on you.
SHANE BUILD YOUR OWN PEEPS.! It’s a real thing. I had to tell u since u love PEEPS!!
It's pretty amusing that shane is talking about ryland getting sick from the pizza and there's an urgent care in the background lol
Love you and I’m glad you’re healing. 💕
When is the next video
Start asking for your pizzas uncut 😉
Wild how many people are ok with pedophilia.
My personal theory is that instead of recycling pizzas, they will cook two fresh pizzas, and switch a handful of pieces and place it on the other to form the messed up shape. At the end of the day, the theory brings more eyes to their business, it’s just a promotional scheme
"we made it" yes sir we did 😂😂😂
Definitely missed watching you❤️🥺
missed you so much! your videos, from the funniest to the darkest, always make me smile through the whole vid. youll probably get sued but i had fun watching!
I’m so happy to see you! Your videos were a huge part of my childhood
I feel so bad for ryland in this video
I grew up with you even if I probably shouldn't have because I was really young as in 3rd grade watching you 😭 now I'm sixteen and some shit has gone down! But I'm so happy to see you! Back!!
Missed u Shane
shane dawson for the love of god please stop
I missed laughing my but off no matter how I was feeling THANK YOU ❤️❤️❤️
That pizza looked good asf
you’re so not pushing 🅿️
I spit my drink when he said a mix to the traditional and stuffed crust 😂
When they log off you go to sleep
i would love that podcast 😭
what is this video about
My (then) teen girls dragged me to Chucky Cheese for pizza because of that video! Now they are in college and I still follow and love Shane!
Iv missed you so much shane!!!<3
I know this will get lost in the comments but I have a good ghost story that happened to me
Don’t forget that Shane is a P3dO there’s literal evidence (and to the people who will say I have no life, yes I’m aware)
I have and always will love this man ❤❤❤❤❤
Shane so dramatic
Shane whatever you enjoy making I enjoy watching I just wish you start making more videos I love watching them they make my day I love you so much I lived you before but I love you even more you’ve grown so much much love ❤️❤️😘😘
Ryland should've said "I gotta poop 🅿️"
Go away
So happy to seem him posting again
Why did i JUST now get this notification? :O
U GUYS LITERALLY DID BOOST CHUCK E CHEESE MORE BAHAHA after that video came out my friends and I all had a party there and got the pizza
i love you shane
Don't let Shane around nem cats tho
I get it lol!! “We made it” 🙌🏼
I’m soooo ready for that next conspiracy video OMGGGGGG
Colorado changes everyone (usually in a good way)
Ryland, he isn't manifesting vagina; he's manifesting life! Babies!! 2023 year of Daddies.
I’ve missed your documentary’s !!!
God I fucking missed you.
bro why wont you disappear PLEASE
funny how quickly yall switched up-  ',:l
I missed you LMAOOO
Since you've blocked his name from the comment section, I will have to say 'your ex-boyfriend who is obsessed with harry potter and wears glasses' literally CARRIED your channel for years because omg it's so boring now
I wanna hate Shane but I can’t
God I miss the kind of laughter I experience from Shane’s videos.
I still love Shane no matter being “canceled” he’s freakin hilarious 😂
Bruh- what happens if someone doesn’t have one of the five senses. Are they playing difficult mood? Like I’m curious.
Just get off YouTube already🤡🤡🤡
My goodness you have to be so careful when your famous/influencer to not be pizzaphobic if the fucking slices dont even match , chucky suck me
i missed you so much. :))
tbh i would love the food videos. I actually started watching you in that time, i didn't watch any of the old and funados videos xD i never liked that type of content. But in the food videos i took an interest cuz' it was just you and your honest to heart humor and food wich we all love, i remember it to be hilarious
pushing p
everytime you said CHUCKEEEEYYYYY?!
Welcome back man!!!
PLS WE NEED A VIDEO WITH GLITTERFOREVER17
gross cant wait for his next drama to happen.
He doesn’t deserve any of the success he has
Y’all are disgusting for literally defending this man.
Had a pretty emotional night and dealing with a lot at the moment. Literally watching this uplifted my spirits and my mood did a complete 360. Thank you so much shane. Warms my heart to see you so happy.
Shanes a bear for sure
I’m glad to see you back Shane. I missed you, I’m 21 now and grew up with your videos. I’ll always watch. Love the truck by the way!! Hello from Colorado as well~
Theyre not married??
...no❤
Omg I get it Shane lmao we made it 😂
The microwave videos!!!
I missed Shane's contents, especially documentaries like this! 🥺
If CEC really has nothing to hide Shane should go make a pizza there. After Shanes old CEC video came out I bet their sales went up. Really, it would benefit CEC and Shane to collab together.
Honestly we kid miss the theories back Like it's was cool Looking over it 🥺
https://youtube.com/shorts/kQWTdlskNes?feature=share
I feel like no matterbwhat shane does ill always watch his videos i just love his personality and thought today inwinder if he has posted any videos i hope you start posting more regularly love you and your documentaries💖💖💖
I love you Shane. I needed this video❤️
Can your camera guy not be so loud? Lol
conspiracy theories pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease
I'm pretty sure Chucky cheese doesn't make pizzas from scratch. They probably have already made frozen pizzas. They cut off one half half for the order and heat it, then put back the other frozen half in the deep freeze for next time.
How’d I not know this existed!?
If only we could get jenna to come back 😭💔
thanks for a great video i loaughed so great at all you guys do i loved it thank you
I need Shane back please!!!!
IM DYING W THE HONKING THING
I actually did find Shane Dawson merch at goodwill once....
Wait, are y’all ignoring he’s into babies and kids ????!!!
This has to be the worst @shane upload he has ever made 👎 Talk about total Nontent 😥
None of these comments seem real. 🤡 super sus
The old Shane's personality was priceless.
Okay I literally don’t care what anyone says about Shane, I’ve watched him for the longest now and this man will always make me happy 💕🥰what a queen
Am i the only one who thinks he looks a lil grey? Idk ily tho
Welcome back broski 👊🏽
I love the relationship Ryland and Shane have, its adorable the love and support they have for one another, even with everything that they have gone through together you can clearly see that their relationship has gotten stronger. Ryland u r the real MVP for real, wish u guys the best and im sure that great things are coming your way! luv u guys xx
Why are you back?
Shane you look phenomenal ❤️
I love watching his videos when I’m smokin
Ok, if I'm being honest, I love Shane. Sometimes he makes a little bit of offensive jokes, but people do it all the time when I was in school.... Shane is funny, and everyone can't take jokes, and everyone can't see he's trying to make a change, which is something, and something is better than nothing.
Shane u just always been so funny I can’t deal lol
We need more !!!
Why so many ads??
Listen I know it’s not my place to comment on anyones relationship but it really is hurting my heart to see Shane continuously make flirty jokes towards Chris while Ryland looks sorta?? Uncomfortable?
The joke about 2022 was close to home lmfao. I celebrate my birthday every year because I never expected to make it this far due to my mental health. Birthdays are a celebration of me not dying to my own mind
My wife and I love Shane but we don’t like Ryland 😂
Am I the only one who thinks Ryland is annoying 🙄😒 like fuck let Shane talk lol always interrupting and needing attention lol
Lol what they probably do is make the pies in advance, and then take slices from those pies and re-heat
As someone who worked at Pizza Hut and cut pizzas when they got out of the oven. They never looked like that. Pizzas don’t look like that why are they still lying 💀😭
I'll buy the house although I only have $175 to my name so maybe we can work something out
a ryland and shane disneyland vlog would be everything
This video is pushing 🅿️
Ahhh I missed you so much!
Sorry dude. I still hate you🥰
I’m so happy you’re back !
There is no recovery from all of this the best decision would to quit YouTube
I’ve grown a lot in the past ten years. It’s ignorant of me to think Shane hasn’t done the same.
Ryland is an old gay grandpa now.
Ugh! I missed your content
One word. FINALLY.
Surely most of these nice comments are just bots right? There’s no way he actually still has fans after all the controversial shit Shane has done. Not to mention his videos today are incredibly boring with no actual plots, his videos just consist of him doing nothing begging his fans to buy his merch.
absolutely not gtfo off YouTube
MISSED YOU SHANE
Every time I watch Shane video where Shane just say anything, I die of laughter. You have a great sense of humor Shane.
Ryland follows Shane around like a lovesick puppy and it's so cute ❤️ Great to have you back.
Please leave YouTube again
I would love if yous ordered a pizza and just asked them not to cut it and see what they give you.. 🙃
I genuinely enjoyed this… glad you’re back shane missed you
Shane, what about doing a podcast with David Icke?!  😮😀👏
I could watch ur videos on repeat u all are so funny to me I be replaying parts because they are so funny 😂🤣😂🤣
You the guy that likes kids
I hadn't laughed like this in a while I love this
I love shane don’t get me wrong but i’m not living for this video as usual when shane uploads
Yes Shane looking like the peanut guy from modern family at 27:36 🤩
is Shane, like, back?
My theory with the pizza: they're just terrible at making the dough to be a circle like other companies cause it sucks to work there and it's not as fancy. Maybe?
Come around more often. Less harder to forget.
Shane! You look amazing! Keep up the good work!
Pushing 🅿️‼️
Kind of irrelevant.. but I forget sometimes that Shane can drive 😂
the iron man thing at the end killleddd me 💀💀🤣🤣
Why does he still have a platform?
i cannot believe the amount of people who are supporting this horrible person. all of you are despicable.
We love you shane from TN
i really miss those videos where u reviewed the scary games and shit with ur friends, are u still in touch with them?
I AM READY FOR WHATEVER PATH YOU CHOOSE! :D TPE
Not y’all in the comments pretending like he did nothing wrong😳🙄 forgiveness is a good trait when someone EARNS it.
why a ford shane,, out of all kinds of trucks:(
Almost back to 20mil I liked this video showing everyone's sense of humor. Always makes me happy to hear.
each pizza slice is like a snow flake there all different and all special in there own ways
Oh great…. You’re back
The amount of bots bro💀
Sooo, I think what happens is they sell individual slices too. So they add the unsold single slices to make a full pizza. It's not recycled or from others tables but I wouldn't say it's "fresh" it's been under a lamp.
I missed you ongggggg 🥺🥺🥺
Conspiracy on this war
The amount of comment moderation and bots is the absolute worst I've ever seen. With the amount of evidence, especially his own words, there's absolutely no way that these accounts are real.
Didn’t we cancel him?
Yess bitch you’re back .. I love you ❤️
go to the fuxxing point, stop babbling endlessy without saying nothing
I needed new Shanes's video in my life
This had no business being this boring. lmao
The conspiracy theory in the beginning is so tired. The fact that our body is controlled by our brain and information is relayed by a bunch of neurons and electrical signals isn't a theory, its a fact. His content is turning into an excuse for the lack there of
He’s got ADHD
Universal Basic Income today! give homeless people your money today!
24:11
Wow not the same amymore.  2010s are really over
this video is making the flooding here in Australia so much better <3
i love you dawsy-poo  😍
Do a new podcast I miss the old one
I'mma need for you to watch Euphoria, and review it.
This is soooo CRINGE!!!!! I feel bad for Ryan :(((((((
My favorite era of Shane is coming back <3
Isn’t this the guy that was accused of creepy behavior?
I’d respect it if you were just acting normal in your videos. The fake energetic weird vibes in the vids doesn’t sit right with me. Wish you didn’t put on a face for the camera
Omg i miss this 😭😭 I've been thinking when shane will come back and yes He's backkk 🥺🥺
how bout let's try, "the imprisonment of Shane Dawson" next. Thanks 💅🏽
You have no idea how much serotonin I get when I randomly check to see if Shane has uploaded just in case and he HAS 🥺 still my favorite!
Does anyone else feel like Shane is being mean to Rieland? I hope they are doing ok
Eat? “NOOoo👀”😂
don’t worry idk what 🅿️ means either😀
I dont know what to say
Shane: We aren't talking bad about ourselves   Everyone: We know you better than that!
gah lee I missed shane so much!!!
Omg please bring back your conspiracy videos 🙌🙌🙌🙌👀
Shane you were never cancelled in my mind.
I FEEL THE SAME I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE IM IN A COMA AND IM PLAYING MY OWN GAME AND FAILING
I was having the worst day and I gave your channel another shot and it made me so so happy<3 I didn't realize how much I missed you
Lol who has at rat as their spokesperson.. Disneyland and chunky cheese 😂
I get it ;)
2022! Yay! We made it! 💀🎉🍾🙌🏽🎊🥳
Yuck
🅿️izza of chucky
Missed you shane! Love your videos
Why are you back?? Shouldn’t you be arrested
Uno is so grown up
Shane posting makes my heart happy
So many people fawning over terrible, aggressively dumb, lowest common denominator garbage...
Idc what he does his theories are 🙏🏽😫
I missed this!! Keep doing this and keep the drama away ❤️
tight 🅿️ energy
I would ask for it un-cut next time and see what it looks like😳
Let's appreciate the fact that there's an Urgent Care right across from the Chuck E Cheese. 😅🤣
I love seeing you happy.
See if they’ll leave it uncut next time!!
GLAD UR BACK!!
Recycling videos like that pizza, including the podcast idea. Man's is washed, looking for a quick buck, and no longer original. Sad.
man dis shi is hilarious, y’all gotta forget da pass 😭
Shane ur 🅿️ushing 🅿️ 💪🏿😈
are you all forgetting what he's done ??? He's so inappropriate.  He shouldn't be allowed views. Just go back and watch what he said about UNDER AGE GIRLS.
Let me say this, Chuck E. Cheese pizza looks weird because of the blade that used to cut it. Its a big rounded edge thing that is hard for the employees to make even slices with. There is video on the Food Theory channel that explains all of this. Google an image of that blade and see what me and that employee are talking about.
where are the hate comments....
Wasn’t christoper the boy he did videos with?
lmao y’all are sooo wrong about the P thing 😂😂😂
Shane: so when I hear a voice in my head..?  Me with 4 different voices in my head: Omg Im such a popular character. Let’s forget about the fact that there used to be 5 but one of them left me.
Shane you give off Alexis Rose vibes from Schiff's creek. Your manerisms are totally her and ryland gives off a bit of David Rose, if he were more self loathing.
yes I get you Shane!! we made it 💗💗
missed you so much
I'm surprised no one got offended by Shane saying fagg0t. Or the constant joking about him and Chris and vaginas. Lol. I guess it really depends on whoever hops on the cancel bandwagon and it has to be really specific to what you will get offended by or consider problematic behavior.
Love your back big fan
Hilarious but Shane have you ever taken a Psychology course?
you should have asked for half stuffed crust half traditional and see if they do it. if they do then its recycled
Tou should order a pizza and ewquwst that they do not cut it to ensure a full fresh pizza
in a way that guy talking about the conscious being the player to the big "game" (simulation) we are in. essentially ur soul, conciousness or what ever u wanna call it is a form of higher being, and they are playing this game as ur body/personality
We haven't forgot....
Wow I have missed you soooooo much!  You made me cry laughing!   I cannot wait for more of your videos!!!
How ive missed this 💕  cuddle up in bed and just watching longer Shane videos. He could talk about poop for 2 hours. And i would still enjoy watching it.
I miss you. I just want you to keep creating and keep trying to be yourself. ♥️
Shane  please don’t change love your sense of humor just remember you can’t make everyone happy people will always have something negative to say. You are funny and great miss your haunted storytimes
So excited too see a video Shane WE MISS YOU 🥰
I'm I the only one who isnt just going to forgive him because you miss his content what he did was absolutely unforgiving I'm sorry I will never continue to support him and I cant belive he just thinks he can just come back and forget everything like nah
That part where he started saying that pizza is trash or something but right away goes like "ok Chucky stop, Chucky~~~ we're FRIENDS" insert clip of pillow fight  xD But seriously though, Chucky E Cheese had the nerve to go after him when he literally SHOWED their pizzas FRESHLY ordered, not like, he spread baseless rumors or claimed something without proof. Them pizza slices not fitting be sitting there, that's evidence Chucky, u can't sneak your rat ass out of that conspiracy anytime soon.
Shane omg if you do a podcast do one with you and Jeffree! It would be iconic
I love you so much Shane please post more😭❤️
There are not a lot of interviews of Shane and anything about him is negative for some reason I was wondering if you would like to do a small interview with me
still not buying Chuck.E.Cheese reasons why the pizza is mixed sizes 😂
This was hilarious 😂 I can’t wait for the podcast
I love u sm
I don’t think I’ve laughed this hard at a video in a long time, the pizza reveal was funnier than it should’ve been
Soooo I thought he said he was uploading like everyday🙄 DONT PLAY WITH MY EMOTIONS!
Honestly  I don't even care about drama he went through or what he did I'm just glad he is back and I hope to see more and more content
Hi Shane, I enjoyed this video. Sending you lots and lots of love!
hows your animals doing shane
Lol image trying to come back-
I missed you so much! I know this is real sad, but you raised me
SSSSSOOOOOO HHHAAAPPPPYYY YYOOUUURREEEE PPPOOOSSSTTTIIINGGG AAAGGGAAIIINNN. We missed you.
👍👍
God I missed this so much
You spent how much money on the pizza?? 80 dollars?????
This is just another merch add. There are more important things going on in the world.
Please come back with some conspiracy theory videos 🙏🙏❤️❤️😘
As much as I understand him being cancelled, I still will continue to enjoy his well done, well edited videos. The same as I will still continue to read the books of Harry Potter even though JK Rowling said some horrible stuff. I am sorry but I will continue to support sth that is good and creative even if the person behind it did something wrong. Not supporting them as a person but supporting their work of art. Idk man
I grew up on your videos, and though life has literally thrown things at you left and right, I’m so glad you’ve stayed strong for so many years and continued making videos.
i love how pedophiles can keep their ability to post to their fanbase of kids on this wonderful platform
OMG IS THAT A DAMN TORTILLA BLANKET ?????
stay gone
Cancelled Anonymous should be the name of podcast and each guest is a "cancelled" celeb. I'll pay to watch dat. First guest aj.
Are we not gonna talk about how there wa a glitch in the system where ryland cut the same cookie twice?
Shane…glad you’re back bby ☮️❤️‍🔥
Why not a behind the scenes at Chuck E? That way we can see how heavy that pizza slicer is 🤣
Still abusing cats?
Lmfaoooo
i’ve missed you so much shane!! I’m so happy to see you posting again ❤️❤️
24:30 shane, did chuck-e make you say this 😳
I needed this. As a Chuck E Cheeses fan, I have ot say, Your conspiracy was rather disateful,but i iwll say your  videos are funny af. I agree withteh piza makers, they make it all by hand and dont sit it in a pan ahead of time so they probably have  a har time cutitng it since most cec pizza is basically thin crust slices of heaven. im2 and love cec a n sitll go/
Ryland holding those pizzas was so smooth. Lol. Such a dad already.
I missed you so much!! I just laughed my ass off. You are straight P bahahaha ! 🤪🤗
As soon as you pulled up in the truck I was just so happy I love you so much for being you❤
the most shocking part of this video is seeing you driving a car lol
the irony of the fact that there’s an urgent care right next to chuck e. cheese 😭😂
Please keep uploading ❤️❤️❤️❤️ we love you Shane. I haven’t laughed this much in a while
I laughed so hard, reminded me why i suscribed back when you were making crazy food. Keep it up!
Shane i’ve been watching your videos since i was a kid! i’m 21 now and we’ve seen sm of what you’ve been through. Glad you got yourself out of cancel culture! Missed ya!
It sure did look suspicious but I’d still eat the pizza 🤣🤣🤣
SHANEEEEEE YOURE BACKKK I LOVE ITTT
I am so happy to have you back
I missed this dude Soo much!! His self deprecating humor has me rolling and i honestly think he is a great person who made a terrible choice. Glad to see you back Shane!!!
Regardless, Chuck E. Cheese’s Pizza is bomb lol

shane’s very 🅿️
When ryland asked for another slice i just died 🤣🤣🤣
idk how you guys sit here and watch a guy who has sexualated minors talking about how you have sex and what periods are how to have babies etc. and recored it and made it a yt video, a guy who black faced and made many charecters based off black sterotypes, made fun of asian people, made a video about wizards of waverly place where he pretened to be the KID audience and was encourging the charecters to have sex, a guy who wanted to make a movie that included scenes of black homeless people eating poop, someone who litterlay got a so called therpist to secertly try to diganose jake paul as a physcopath and so much more, he is fucked up in the head and hasent even propley apoligzed or improved any of his behavior yet you guys act like nothing happened, digusting.
Stop joking with Christopher you giving Ryland a complex
Need more videos love your videos
Didnt u do a bunch of bad stuff
Yayy I have missed you!!🥰
I missed Shane so much. I was having major anxiety today and this brought me happiness. Thank you Shane !!!

No one talks about how ryland is funny asfffff 😂😂😂 he doesn’t even try … just being himself 😂😂😂

Shane Dawson videos are my comfort videos, I'm sorry but I just can't cancel Shane.
chris cross apple sauce
This forced humor and manic laughter are not it. It's time to get a new persona.
Hey ! Please make a video on Madonna Frozen Song decoding 😨

WE MISSED YOU SHANE ♥️‼️
Pushin P by Gunna
I don’t know why the person playing my simulation wants to sit here and o this mundane government work I’m doing right now but ok
I’m too high for this pizza part
I hope they sue you again creep
I love you
Idc I love Shane and Ryland
100% convinced this is why Shane Dawson was “ cancelled “ he had people against him because of all the troops he was exposing
I LAUGHED SO MUCH THIS VIDEO
They have to be making all medium pizzas…. And then like adding slices in to make it a large…
Cancel culture needs to end… bc your witty JOKES are so needed. What a light video that did exactly what it was meant to.. Gave me some chuckles about Chuck E. Cheese’s!
As much as working there legit fucked my mentally and physically I will say the pizza is fresh I can’t tell you how many days I went home with pizza dough ingredients stuck to my clothes. However there is no way besides the screen to shape the pizza and when you get a bunch of high school kids just trying to make money to pay for coffee and clothes they really don’t care about the pizza being perfectly round and they just barely stretch it to size and then toss  everything together. Then when they go to cut it people most of the time do just throw it on the cutting board smack some dusty garlic butter on the crust and  even though in training they say try to make even cuts you never have more then 30 seconds before the next pizza comes out so people just smack the cutter down and not care that the pizza has shifted causing the pieces to not be cut uniform so when you put the pizza in the tray they don’t fit together correctly. The pizza is probably the least fucked up thing about the place.
Howled laughing to the point of crying. Love your videos so happy Shane is back cant wait for more ❤️ im now wanting pizza 🍕🤤
I love you sorry
This is the content I’ve been waiting for!
Wow so funny I laughed so much hahahahaha you are so funny and I would never be sarcastic and lie to you because I really really love you. :/
I thought you were 'too poor' to afford all this shit??? Hello????
Ryland tried so hard to save this video
You gotta buy pizza from other places to compare it!!!
yay Conspiracy theories on the way 💚💥
Lol just 3 mil views in 9 days. His channel died, thank god.
Let us never forget the malicious action he had done., he's manipulating all of you
I just want a Shane x Britney seriessss
Wuv ya!
He should not be allowed into Chuck E. Cheese at all 😶
When you go on a hiatus and all of a sudden get that Shane Dawson notification...not even mad. Been watching him since the superluv days 🥰
Apparently you can now blame being an a..hole on being in the matrix
I FIGURED OUT THE CHUCKY CHEESE SITUATION!!!!! They make their dough and when they take it out the oven whatever it is they put it on a big cutting board then cut it, then slid it into the box ot the tray they serve it on. I've asked my friend who worked there and i kinda see it bc the pizzas in this video the pepperoni matched up (maybe it didn't before but all that matters is now that it does..)
Ok but the cancelled anonymous part, was pure fun HAHAHAHAHA
I LOVE YOU SHANE IVE SEEN ALL OF YOUR AMAZING CONSPIRACY THEORIES PLEASE MAKE MORE  💗
I need someone to explain this fucking pizza to me lmao
This is exactly what I needed ❤❤❤ hope you keep making content Shane, you've been my favorite creator for 8 years.   P.S. Where can we send you fan mail? 🙏
you should have remained canceled. and retiered. the way you hummiliate your bf is disgusting Shane.
I love seeing Shane amped up to go out to get takeout in LA. But I love the crumbles car videos in Colorado more.
LMAO UR SO FUNNY ISTG
The fact 🅿️ made it to Shane Dawson's video is 🅿️
I’m so happy you’re making content again! I’ve missed your videos and you need to know you still have fans who support you a hundred percent this cancel culture has gotten out of hand and some people can’t stand to see other people climb to the top so they knock them off before they can even get there. Don’t let other people take away or measure your success the real ones will always have your back.
I also really miss the old food videosss😩❤️ and if I could afford to by the la house I would in a heart beat!
Didn't Food Theory do a video on it already?
pov your watching the vid in ur room in the dark, and the psychic part came up and the whole room went dark
OH MY FUCKING GOD!!! SHANE! YOU'RE BACK!!!!! :) :)
Get Eugenia help.
I love you so much thank you for this I've missed you and I can't wait for the podcast. Btw  Chuckie Cheese now sells frozen Versions of their pizza in Smith's here in Las Vegas. My son got it he said it sucked. Love you boo❤️❤️❤️🖤❤️🖤🎉🤩👏👐👏
Iv bee watching your vids since 2008!! I’m glad your back !!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Really wish you would take accountability fully :(( I used to be such a fan
This is so yikes,everyone kissing up to your again even tho your a literal creep I can’t do this
I laughed my ass off. ❤️
First time watching you again since u got canceled, I hope we can come around from that and get back to normal soon.
Man, I am so excited! I know you have been through a lot of hardships and confrontations but your video content never fails to entertain me. I grew up watching your videos. I love how authentic and real you are! Don't ever stop. This is you.  :)
YES I BEEN WAITING FOR MORE CONSPIRACYS
SHANE WHEN IS THE NEXT EPISODEEEE
Me: I missed Shane  Gf: Shane?  Me: 🤨 Gf: Shane Dawson?🤔🤨 Me: yes Shane Dawson, what other Shane is there. There’s no other shane in the world.
Holy negativity... People must be trying to feel better about themselves for making rude comments on a video you shouldn’t even be watching if you don’t enjoy it. There’s enough hate in the world right now. Everyone makes mistakes in their lives, we don’t know the whole truth of someones life... Would you like it if you got negative and ignorant comments on your posts all the time?   Respect to those who show kindness to Shane, those who can tell he likes to joke around a lot and is a genuine, nice person 💓
PLEASE do TPE merch omg lmao
when they opened the pizza 🤣🤣🤣🤣 i love shane's reaction.
I’m sorry Shane. Since all the scandal and all the hoopla.. I truly loved you but now.. I see through your jokes and it’s honestly quite immature. Although you have such an addictive personality. I must part way as your antics have me ticked.
YAYAYAYAYA I’M SO HAPPY RN!
The pure chaos in this video 🤣🤣🤣 Lawd I have MISSED Y’ALL!!!!! 🖤🖤🖤🖤
*** NO IDEA IF YOU WILL SEE THIS BUUUUTTTTT 2 things 1 I too got engaged in 2019 Christmas eve to be exact and don't plan on getting married until 09|16'2023 so don't beat yourselfs up to badly about that buuut  secondly I have an almost 2 year old and you will never guess his name .. I named him Ryland then proceeded to purchase the Ryland Liquid Lip Just to say my son's name is on my lip stick 😅😅
Ok but I’ve missed you so much
I needed this video so badly!!! I haven't laughed so hard in months; please post another asap!!!!! Ya'lls sense of humor is amazing
So if we in a simulation and people are controlling us, what about those people, what do they do, how do they live life? Other than controlling a simulation. And why do we need to eat and drink water to survive. Whats the point of that. Whats the point of any of it. This why i dont like these conspiracies. They dont make sense. There is no point other than to say other people made you do something to take blaime of yourself in my opinion
Shane im not a big fan of conspiracy theories anyway. I think alot of your subscribers are that way. So you shouldn't have to worry when you upload videos that arent.
shane if you have any garbage you wanna get rid of im open for donations :)
Wondering why Shane feels messed up sometimes, ... hear his brother talking.... it all makes sense.  Stop listening to him!!
Spoiler alert: he gets a pizza ... that's all that happens
ain’t now way shane dawson doesn’t know what pushin 🅿️ means
This was exactly what we needed
That person in your brain is you though 😂
THAT *DELICIOUS* PIZZA WAS $80!???!
I am just so happy you are back ! I missed seeing you posting new videos. Just a great way to take my mind off of all of the things that cause me stress
23:27
37:18 The urgente care in the backkkkkk😭
0:03 no
love you!!!!
YESSS!!!! QUEEN IS BAAACK!! So happy shane!! Never change <3
Funniest video I’ve watched in a long time. Obnoxiously laughing rn
I love how you saw a psychic! That’s awesome and please let us know about a podcast!!! Do whatcha love❤️ Love you Shane🥰
I work at a Pizza place we make our own dough and we cut our pizzas on a cutting board with a big cutter and our pizzas stay round lol JS
Are you a top or a bottom?
i miss watching you as often as i used to and im realizing this now lol but don't tell the kiddos i said that
Shane brightens up my day, he's so funny!
y’all r so fake, one second the same people that r watching this r the same ones that canceled him lmao
Your discusting.
Love this vid can't wait 2 months for a new one😭😭
Me waiting on the tight pu$$y energy shirts 🥰😂
I like Shane. I feel like who am I to judge him and cast stones his way, like I'm so great and don't make mistakes, have huge personality flaws. All we can ask is that he does better just like we wanna do better. I forgive because I have been forgiven. God bless you Shane, keep up the good work❣️
at least he didn't drone this waste of time over 5 weeks like usual
Sometimes….its like……jus get to the point already!!!
pushing 🅿️ shane
Shane I hope you do a video on JSC skin care!!!!!!
I literally died laughing at “mixed” when they asked about the pizza crust🤣🤣🤣
get out already
It's such a shame that Shane is canceled because he is legitimately so hilarious! I was laughing my ass off throughout this entire thing 😂😂😂😂
For the half and half pizza, they probably had a cheese and pepperoni pizza cooking, or ready, so they cut both in half, added a little more cheese, put it back in the oven to heat it up and then put them together in the box.
Welcome back…..you are extremely talented and funny (and for some reason I feel like deep down inside of you, you know this too.) I don’t care what anyone thinks and I can’t wait to see what you do in 2022. ❤️ much love to you and yours.
I missed him so much 🤍🤍
ive been laughing the entire time
Missed you
i literally missed watching these videos😩 coming home and watching these and a good nap these vids would hit diff😩
Yes!! I’ve missed you on my feed!! I can’t wait for more!!❤️❤️
Please call is 🅿️odcast
If you’re gonna come back we’re gonna need those good ass conspiracy videos!!!!!! Lol🤨😤
We are so happy you are here
Do sell the house give it to me!!!
The entire first 20 minutes makes me feel like I’m hanging out with my friends😂😂
Yuck.
I do get it and we freaking made it ✨
❤️
We were literally watching the three part serious where I said  “How long ago was the last video? Shane Dawson posted 23 minutes ago guys…” we got excited 😂😂
I get it Shane 🤣
Let me tell you. I work at Chuck E. Cheese and they make the pizza fresh. I watch them cut the pizza straight out the oven and somehow. It still looks fucked up so idk 😩😭
creep
Shane’s a shitty person and I hate him for everything he did, but he helped 9 year old me through all of the shitty times and helped me realise it was okay to be bi and I don’t think I would have came out if it weren’t for him. I don’t like him but I’m so thankful that she did because otherwise I wouldn’t be who I am today and I wouldn’t be here today either. I didn’t even know being bi was an option before I found Shane. So yeah I hate him but I’m so grateful for everything and for keeping little me alive
😂🤣😂🤣🤣 freaking loving this. I missed your content!
Rylands eye rolling in this video is ✨ICONIC ✨  we missed you Guys !!!
Seems you and Ryland are possibly having some issues! Just the vibe I am getting!   🤔🤔🤔
You don’t deserve a platform
Do they precut it before cooking? If so it could warp like this….mayyybbee?
Shane pushin  p
Keep posting conspiracy theories plsss I never have anything to do when but working and I love binge watching your conspiracy theory videos😭❤️
Love Shane and his videos, seeing him in a good place is awesome. I miss the content where it was just Shane- too much Ryland tbh lol
How do y’all still like to watch this man🤣
“We made is Chucky” DEAD
For the pizza they could have it where they offer slices so they initially cook the whole pizza but then in cases they take two half’s and just remelt them together
I’ve missed the Shane energy so much! I watched every video ever made. I’ve been a subscriber for YEARS. I’m so glad to see you back and posting and can’t wait for any updates on the podcast. I still wear my pig robe DAILY!
Missed your videos Shane!!
Shane Dawson kind fell off 😞
Omg i missed ur vids and u huggles
“Chuck E Cheese pizza is a blended family.” ☠️🤣🤣🤣
Even what yoy do ill still watch the conspiracy theory’s ☠️
MY FAVORITE PERSON IS BACK!!!!!! this was so funny !!!! thank you shane for everything you do. you have raised me !!!!
First off love ya Shane and I took my daughter there when she was 2 and 3 n now she’s 5   They gave us fresh pizza and it looked nothing the pics   Maybe we jus have a good one on long island
You gotta keep on pushing 🅿️
I love having you back and laughing
stinky man
I luv u shane! I miss when u did conspiracy theories or those challenges back in uhhhh 2016 to 2018. Been watching u since shanaynay (kinda regrettable) but still I have supported u and Ryland for so long. ♡ Era
I really needed this today
This video really made my day. I can’t wait for the next one!
Really Super
Was painful to watch Ryland being subtly bullied and rediculed and shamed ike that .. wowwww
The pizza reveal got me anxious lmaooooo
the part when they open the last cheese pizza had me crying.. SHANE;  "but when they come together, look at how beautiful they are."  RYALND; "PREACH BROTHER!!" hahahahahahah
The fact that this man is still receiving support and hasn’t taken any real accountability whatsoever makes me lose with faith in humanity in a real degree not in a joking way because all the wrong and bad things he has done have not been forgotten by normal individuals and he has been going about like none of it happened anymore which is kinda sickening when you think about thoroughly. This just further cements the idea that if you’re big enough in the social media/online space you’ll never face any repercussions whatsoever for your illegal, disgusting, and or incentive actions and instead will be welcomed back with open arms. I for one refuse to forget because all the things he’s done require an honest response and accountability only after that is done I’ll debate whether I forget about it this or not.
everyone forgetting hes a nonce??
YOU SPENT 80 BUCKS ON 3 SUS PIZZAS ?!?!???!?
Yes Shane put in those ads🤣 I have premium so I dont care 😝🤣🤣🤣🤣
Maybe they cut it before they put it in the oven🤣
I wonder if they sell pizza by the slice? So maybe they put together partial pizzas to make a whole one…🤷‍♀️
I was literally watching another YouTuber review this and they were being quite gloomy and remembered how funny you were and had to stop and actually come watch your video  😂
I love Shane videos. We are 10 minutes in and I still dont know what we are doing 🤣🤣
I didn't forget what you did, why did y'all?
I’ve been engaged half of my life… I’m 36 now 😂
I got scared u was turnin’ into a farmboy, we’re happy to have u back 💕
Why does it feel like when his fiance brings up marriage Shane literally looks sooo hmmm idk that's weird
I could not stop smiling the entire time ! ❤Shane your sense of humor I always loved since day 1. Never stop being happy, you deserve it and Ryland is the best ❤❤
Oh wow I looked ip Shane and my fiancé is born July 19th they’re VERY CURIOUS BEINGS he’s also big on conspiracy and indifferent sense of humor like ohm my fiancé drives me nuts with his curiosity lol
Do they do it on purpose?  Hah Idk? Lol Soo fun to watch you. Happy your back Shane♡
I also do believe the simulation theory to an extent however I’m also a nihilist and people say they contradict eachother and some say they fit together
I love you Shane 🥰🥰🥰 please make more videos 🥺🥺🥺
I am happy  that your back and i never laughed that hard along time ago thanks shane watching u from Middle East since i was 7 now i am 21
Not gonna lie, I'm so glad he's back 👌🏻
This is home
Yay you’re back!!!
Shanes pushin P its from a song!
We love you, Shane! You are back!
Just look up the video of them making the pizza on YouTube. It's the slicer and the imperfect way people slice with their safety slicer. You can't tell me the pizza looks the same and isn't overly burnt and other characteristics that would indicate real tampering and reshaping but still different pizza. AND may I mention, it literally makes no sense that you guys say the pizza slices are left over and molded back together with cheese and toppings but then what, resliced again?! Do you actually know what that would mean and look like? You wouldn't just get misshapen you'd literally have slices of pizza that has 2 different make ups and might have a divide in it already. AND you'd have toppings left over in the pizza making it even more crazy and you'd taste it. This conspiracy theory is just that a crazy conspiracy theory. If you don't have common sense or think critically of course you'd believe it!
My thing is when you start a friendship with someone you’re accepting them for who they are and part of that is your past, if that’s something someone can’t handle that’s their choice to not be friends with the person anymore. But in these situations keep in mind the mistakes you’ve made, and then think of that mistake being posted everywhere for everyone to judge, that’s a thing you really can’t even imagine until going through it so cut people some slack. Ask yourself if this person has shown growth, why tear them down for a mistake they made years ago. Keep it up shane you have so many people who love you and the things you have to offer, you really have made this a better and brighter world for so many people, thank u shane <3
The fact we’re all trying to find the explanation for the pizza but nothing makes sense 😭
Love you Shane glad your back and doing well missed you so much been watching you forever I’m even gonna buy one of your hoodies on Friday 😊😊😊❤️❤️❤️
When he said, if you're watching this, you get it. I just kept nodding agreeably. 🤣🙈
Voice in ur head warning you is God not a ‘player’ controlling you we all have free will
“We made it, Chuck E!!!” I’m dead ☠️
I was DYING while Ryland was ordering the pizza 🤣🤣🤣 y’all should have ordered the pizza uncut!
We love Shane content, you’re funny Shane, real fans don’t care. Coming from the Hollywood fix tho, you CAN come back after being cancelled. Don’t let them shake you, proud of your progress
Shane, you are bi. Are you sure you want to get married? Ryland is a doll, but if you have kids it would be so sad to see you both go through a separation that would hurt so many. Does Ryland ever feel like he's female and want to transition?  Please. Just be very careful. Don't think it can work in your favor of having a woman on the side with Ryland's approval. If you have any doubts, please, sooner than later is as painful but you're all still very young to move forward.    Oh, just let me say, I am a Me2'er. You've learned the hard way there should be limitations on what is and isn't appropriate around children and young people.  Please, help those of us who have been traumatized as children by misguided adults. I've forgiven my abusers, but I will never forget how they ruined my life. I'm old now, and this is coming with me to my grave. Use your influence to bring awareness to this sensitive subject. You are masterful behind the camera, writing, and editing. Use it to help those of us who were taught to believe it's partially our fault and that it is an illness and rests on the abuser's shoulders. Though some would argue that point. The human brain isn't fully developed until we're mid 20-ish. I'm not saying wait that long to be intimate, but help those who pish posh SA see the damage they do to the innocent victims.   Best of luck, warmest wishes in all you do. 🌹☘☮ 💚
Glad he hasnt changed, still the same funny dude.
You are literally one of the reasons I'm not in a casket LMAO. Love you Shane <3
I’m so glad you are back :,) You bring me so much joy ❤️
I miss you. I’m so happy you didn’t let them win.
Oh my gosh! Shane I have missed you so much 💗💓
these Shane docs were the only thing I could ever fixate on adhd is weird asf but it’s tru so I’m truthfully excited ab this
I can't wait myself for more video! I am so excited! your video bring joy to my boring life!
I missed you!!!! And can’t wait for more videos!
The fact that no one cares that our PRESIDENT has done worse to children, but care about someone who literally has no impact on your daily life, is soooo confusing to me
SHANE! Invite Dave Weiss on your conspiracy docs!
“ and you realize you’re with Jamie Lynn “   LMFAOOOOOO
I wish we could trade you for Jenna marbles.
anyone ever thought to order one and ask them not to cut it
Yuck 🤢
I like shanes energy but I can get why some comments come off wrong or controversial. Like it’s funny but it’s not everyone cup of tea…
I laughed throughout this entire video. So glad you're back Shane and so excited for the podcast!!! :D
I have NEVER Been more happy to see a YouTube post notification in my life! I love you and missed you so much and seeing you thriving makes me feel so happy. I am proud of how far you have come and I have been hoping and waiting to see you again. Never fail to make me smile💕✨
I think I waited so long to watch this because I didn't want it to be disappointing or underwhelming (I've literally missed you so much) and I had really high expectations but let me tell youuuu, I am not disappointed or underwhelmed at all. The first thing outta my mouth was "god damn he's still got it!" I literally laughed out loud throughout this whole video. I am so excited for whatever you have next. I've missed this so very much. 💜
Crumbl should do a specialty cookie cake for your wedding 💗
Give up YouTube , you are not wanted bottom feeder!
funniest man alive idc
The iconic pig shirt is my favorite merch tee ever
I sobbed when i saw a new video coming up
yo same we made it lmao
Lmfao im to high for this 🤣
I missed you so much!!!
Wow it’s crazy that he really isn’t allowing any sort of negative comments. The only ones I’ve seen are in reply to some comments. I still think he should give a proper apology and help out the communities/ppl he hurt. I don’t forgive him but if he did something then I would at least somewhat respect him more and it would show that he is growing like he has said he has.
Hey so maybe do some research before uploading about anything, and I mean ACTUAL research. Like FOOD THEORY did . Matt Pat did a video debunking this BS Chucky cheese shit you keep going on about. That’s normal behavior for pizza when you cut it, you can literally look at pics from any other pizza place and it’s the same. And idgaf about chucky cheese, but if they go under because you’re trying so hard to grasp on a FALSE conspiracy theory and people lose their jobs then that’s on YOU. Maybe leave YouTube and don’t come back till you can ACTUALLY apologize for being a horrible person and stop making videos that you did zero research on.
Wait because about the game conspiracy… I have thought about us being “dolls” and people making us do the things we do
I been watching Shane for years and now I know why I'm gay
I Missed you this Quarantine Shane 😭, please never go away too long... your content helps me , now as an Adult, Depression has been really hard and you always light up my day.  Love you ! ❤ .. sending love from Houston, Texas !! My name is Dianey btw 🥰
Y'all need to watch this video high 😂😂😂😂
L
I can debunk the pizza. They probably make a bunch of pizza and when you customize it and  they just pull apart pizzas and put them together to fit the order.
P does not mean that
Shane I wish you did mukbangs
the first 10 minutes are straight choas and i cant breathe im laughing so hard
I missed you and im glad you joke about everything. I never thought you were a bad person.  Everyone has done stupid shit but that doesn't make you bad. You are hilarious and clearly 19.9 mil people agree
Conspiracy theories ARE MY SHIT and idk what u say shane is the og
I forgot how much joy Shane brought to me until I’m watching these new videos lol love u Shane!!
I need more of this in my life 😩😂
7:50 I'm gay and love marvel! Honestly it is getting more gay now with phase 4 marvel. Eternals is pretty gay, Wanda Maximoff is a queen and slays, Loki is a bisexual king... the list goes on!  Edit: Also the men there.. ;)  Thor, Loki, Peter (Tom Holland), captain america... ;)
6:50 "how romantic" gives me Wanda Maximoff vibes idk
can’t wait for you to come back completely 🤍
I’m all for chane if you get my drift 😩👀💖🙏🏼
It's probably the pizza that is out to long at the buffet,  you can tell by the pepperoni on the sides of the slice dont connect or match up
I wanna go to your wedding
I’m sorry but what the fuck
I could not stop laughing😂😂😂
So wait? As a comeback he wants to make videos exploiting his brothers mental illness? Gurl werk. *tongue pop*
Please do spooky 👻 videos again with a new crew.  Like the bloody Mary urban legend stuff when u did spooky boys.  I really miss thoughs.
0:50 my voice in my head says that this is bullshit
I used to be your biggest fan
You. Are. The. Worst.
I makes total sense bc i work at a pizza place in Ohio and not all our pizza slices turn out the same if cut in pie slices
They prob pre-make them and put it together for what ever order it is.
Shane if you don't want to eat the pizza but your fiance want it give half the homeless next time you buy Chuck E cheese pizza
WE NEED MORE SCARY VIDEOS
All the comments on here HAVE TO be fake... I refuse to believe so many people are SO brain dead that they choose to ovetlook this toxic person's behavior...
i miss you so much shane. i love you, as long as theres no solid proof of anything horrible of you currently, ill always be a steady supporter. no matter what <3
Nothing makes me happier then opening YouTube and seeing a new Shane video 🤤
You’ve grown as a person shanked and I never stopped supporting you 💕
I cannot believe grown adults find this entertaining.
Honestly I couldn't stop laughing from start to finish. Brilliant video. I never got rid of the Merch my dear. In fact just used conspiracy yesterday on my eyelids. 💕 Love these videos. Needed it for my soul.  If you're ever in Ireland I'd keep you lol you're so funny Shane. I've been watching you since I was a youth from the old sketches to who you are now as a person. Your journey. 💕 I do tarot and I see spirits. Love that you have a spirit guide called Christopher. Mine is seraphina. And Archangel Michael. 💕 Sending you love. And also love to Ryan, and Chris. ☺
New merch please!!!!
Thanks for such a thrilling and watchable video shane! Its so exciting when u say and do abunch of dumb shit no asked or cared for. Good job!
♥️♥️♥️♥️ love you always
I honestly miss watching you soooo much I am so sorry for everything that has happened I truly am happy to hear you voice again
Pushing 🅿️
I look forward to uploads everytime. Thank you for the distraction. I love u! You’re glowing sis 😝
My 23 birthday is Friday and I’ve been crying every single day, anywho. I’ve missed you Shane. Welcome back.
Fatty Mcpatty thinks he's not canceled
Literally tho, WE MADE IT 😭
The fact that he’s driving a truck got me fucking weak
My husband and I did a destination wedding in Hawaii and it was just the two of us and two other people... it was the best and the photos were beautiful and then we enjoyed our honeymoon right away lol. You can always do a small casual wedding anywhere and even keep it as simple as only close family and friends. It's so much better and intimate than large weddings.
we still love you shane keep making videos again!!❤️❤️❤️
Im going to get a job at chuck e. cheese just to figure this shiz out 💀😂😂
Yooooooo pls keep making content like this. Ur literally sooo fucking funny!!! U make me so happy 😂😂
Pushin 🅿️
Good to see you again Shane. Was wondering what happen to you. Stay strong Shane.
Thank you for posting Shane. I love your content (:
i work at a pizzeria and our slices aren’t…discombobulated they line up pretty well
I love that Shane is all over the place but can still get back to the task on hand by make it freaking hilarious  I wish we were friends.  I've missed you. have you seen your mech at the goodwill?
Why are you so mean to Ryland? Even if it’s you trying to be funny it’s super mean. Imo you’ve always done that, made fun of those around you to get laughs at their expense.
He said 😏 a mix lmfaoooo 😂😂😂
Why is the truck so dirty was he in the woods digging
He’s BACK
Omg you guys crack me up! I'm straight and still here! And all the merch ideas are great! Lmao 💜💜
I Don't care who you are, this man was part of our childhood. Shame on these people for discouraging Shane from giving us some quality content. The world can use a chuckle now more than ever. I remember the early 2010's and wish everyday I was still living in that time of my life, and that was partially due to Shane and a lot of the other viral Youtube videos that were being created at that time. If I can get just an ounce of my childhood back that would be great.
I love this i missed your content
I’m sensing some serious hostility ab the marriage thing between them lol
Wait is he not still with ryland?! 😭😭😭😭
I NEED THE TPE MERCH ASAP 🤣
Wait no… he did NOT spend 80$ on THREE PIZZAS 😂
Not Ryland the only one eating the damn pizza 😂😂😂😂
How do u feel about Eugenia Cooney
So happy you are back! Me and my husband have missed your conspiracy videos! I did watch this when you posted so this is just a late comment… (I never comment on YouTube vids 😅) since watching this though I have been rewatching your older vids and Ryland’s Vlogs. Can’t wait for the rest! 🤍
Me coming to the comment section to figure out what 🅿️ means 😂😂 someone explain I missed something
You SHOULD interview UFO people lol
Honestly you should name your next kid or pet as Chuck e. like that would make it impossible for them to sue you ! also absolutely love watching you guys again, I can't imagine how we made it through these past years without you ☺️
Was sitting alone in a restaurant tonight, just trying to enjoy my own company with a beautiful view and a nice meal... but some.pf the staff was treating me like a weirdo, kept asking if/when anyone is joining me. Then I thought: fuckit. I kicked off my shoes and opened my phone and watched and laughed along to this video while eating their mediocre overpriced food. I ended up having a blast.
21:21 Hermosa elección 😘 LIkeex.Uno de los mejores conciertos ❤   11:15  Staccy: "Hyper" 11:12  Sun: "Hotter" 18:00  Yoongi: "Butter" 11:12  Hopi: "Sweeter" 00:18  Joonie: "Cooler" 11:12  Amoy: "Monks"   21:22 Son unos de los mejores conciertos, no puede ir pero de tan solo verlos desde pantalla, se que estuvo sorprendente 41uh
I love you shane so glad you’re back !
Is there some drama between Jeffree, tana and Shane? Only asking because the tiktok on Jeffrees snap story has me confused lol
Is that the ocean in the back 👀
I seriously adore you Shane
i’ve been waiting so long for you to post again and i’m so glad that ur back
Thank you so much for the post shane you have no idea how many people use your videos to cope. You’re an amazing person so glad to see you genuinely happy and posting again!!!!
“I wouldn’t say that offensive stuff today.”  Proceeds to call Ryland an offensive slur and make him feel less the whole video 👍🏻 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
What the fuck is wrong with y’all.
it’s disgusting how all you have to do is go away for a while and everybody forgives you
So all of a sudden we forgot about what all he did?
he really put the 🅿️ comments in the video without getting it 💀💀💀💀
Hi honey I’ve missed you
Omg I’ve missed you
I don't want to support him from what he's done, but he was my childhood and it's so nostalgic
GLAD YOUR BACK WOW I MISSED YOU
Why the camera person and sean always flirt
I love chris lol
I love you Shane Dawson, will forever be my favorite YouTuber❤️
Omg if it wasn’t because you uploaded this video I had completely forgot I was subscribed and needed to unsubscribe and the first minute supported my decision....yuck...bye
That "spokesperson" said some people cut the pizza in different ways 😆😆😆 wtf it still makes a circle no matter how you cut it
WELCOME BACK SHANE💯😭😍🤌‼️
Beginning to sound like nsync at the start there with Ur "bi....biiii?..bi..." 😂😂
Omg Shane this was hilarious & we missed yooouuuu! 🤩
literally wish that was a welders mask he was weariing
Go to YouTube and search pushing P you’ll find your right answer my guy listen to it 😎
Okay you're going to have to stop doing that s*** we all love you here and of course there's going to be some assholes but for the most part you have a lot of supporters that love you and love your content whether it be vlogging or your content that you like to do so let's get the ball moving on the vlogs and your content love you buddy and so glad you are going to post right
I’m so fucking happy your back and even happier you’re awakening
conspiracy theory:  most of this is old footage :o
I loved every minute of this video I missed you sm Shane 💓
Welcome back shane i missed your uploads ❤️
I personally worked at chucke cheese in the kitchen and have made pizzas myself. THey are home made so sometimes whoever makes and cuts the pizza fucks up real bad lol. Thats why they look jank sometimes. But they are not recycled!
Shane making Rylan insecure in their relationship for 40min *straight*
Honestly this made me crave chucky cheese pizza and pizza overall😂but it’s always nice seeing Shane upload every once in a while
I love ❤️ this
I work at Dominoes and we can cut the pizza with two separate utensils, both of which would never cause a pizza to end up looking like Chuck E. Cheese's Frankenstein of a pizza.
Can you do a documentary on the mole people in Las Vegas?
Happy to see this man uploading again. A YouTube OG and legend. I've been loving his content since 2007ish
I’m so glad he posted again bc I love laughing at his videos 😂
This video is so cringe and disrespectful to Ryland.
They gonna break up
Next time order it but ask them not to slice it. That’ll be the ultimate test. They’ll have to make a fresh one.
Do u ever think that the people that cut them are just stupid
28:50 so much truth. We have a GIANT fall festival every year. It’s the class(ok entire schools) reunion nobody asked for. To put this shit show in perspective I graduated with a class of 63 people. Nobody asked for it. I need a face shield like Shane’s. Sunglasses only hide so much… especially with fire truck red hair 🖍🚒
The “take off your mask” would’ve been funny if they were actually wearing masks. He probably is a republican.
the only person that can get 3 million views on literally nothing at all lmao I love it
ew
Ryland 🚩🚩🚩🚩 babes you deserve better
So who else wanted a slice?
why are you back lmao the internet was better when you were gone
If you like crumbl you should try paderia bakehouse!!!! They have three locations!
Keep posting Shane get your creative mind working again and don’t focus on the views anymore. The real ones stuck by and still love you. 🤘
PODCASTS PLEASE
I’m sad that the video is over
Wait.. who wants a new conspiracy video?
The level of cringe is far too much 😐
I’ve always loved your content even when it was considered “offensive” I thought u were funny as fuck, ppl get way to “triggered” these days , your humor is GOLD I wish your old videos were still up that was my childhood bro 😅
I’m so glad you’re back. I missed you so much, Shane!!! ❤️
this was incredibly boring
Shane is back baby!!!! I’m so happy he’s literally my favorite youtuber out there. There’s always gonna be people who get offended by humor because it’s subjective! Keep doing you!
I worked for chuckE cheese in gilroy so this is hilarious and paxtis pizza also.  So most pizza companies have a already formed slicer to cut the pizza. ChuckEs doesn’t. Everyone has to slice own and the slicer is usually bent.
I hate everything Shane did but when i need something entertaining to watch HE ALWAYS COMES TO MIND
YES I WANT PODCASTS
Missed you Shane glad to have you back
15:02 i never knew this
Ryan just screams insecure lol
Were you by chance listening to "The mile high podcast"?? Kendall and her husband are amazing <3
I for one am glad you're back Shane....I have missed your silly personality. I hope you and Ryland have the wedding YOU GUYS want.
This was so funny.!! Shane your sense of humor just tickles me pink. Not like in a butt way. This video was hilarious thank you.!
So what is the P emoji?….
Aren’t pizzas always cut into 8 slices tho? That last one had ten?
Literally when that O’Reilly theme song came up I was like oh god my childhood. Kids and teachers would sing that at me in the halls it was so annoying 😂😂
It’s the smile on his face for me ❤️🥺 welcome back Shane again
Ofc you get the large pizza..duh.. have a great day Shane!!
We made it!!!! ..  yes we did 😂😂😂
Been watching u since second grade and I’m now a junior in college! I love u Shane❤️
Shopping for your merch at goodwill took me out 😂
My friends tease me, because I love Chuck E’s cheese pizza. It’s tasty! Don’t shape shame Chuck, Shane! 🍕 If Shane is a bear, that means Ryland is a cub. 🐻 🐻
Shane please come back
i love your videos im happy youre back!
Love how he laughs so hard at all his own jokes because...same.
Why is the March so expensive damn
i missed shane so much i’m so happy he’s back. Shane you’re hilarious :)
Ew.
As a trans woman I’m telling you that, that surgery joke was not funny okay
How old is this guy?  He acts like a 12 year old.  Holy shit this was bad.
feel like theres an insinuation that having a 'non tight' pussy is bad lmao. dont do that thanks
hey could have put a time stamp of when you talked about the law suit in the comments
ive missed shane so much 😭 i don’t even care about what he’s done in the past just love watching y’all 💗
i feel home again
Finally an actual good YouTuber came back to save me from all the bull content sprouting about. I want 100 conspiracies by the end of the week ty.....
Lool, was that iron man not copyright?
I missed you Shane. Thank you for being a content creator for as long as you have been. Thank you for always being the hero in my life.
I’m so happy Shane is back making videos I’ve missed him and seeing him in rys videos wasn’t the same. So happy you’re back Shane ☺️
I think interviewing regular people would be awesome.  Obviously famous people and influencers would be interesting but every day people and their struggles and happy moments would be very fun and relatable to watch.
Another conspiracy about Chuck E. Cheese: during the pandemic, people would order pizza on Uber from like Luigi's (or any generic pizzeria name) but the pizza would actually be from Chuck E. Cheese to make sure they would lose too many customers when the dinning room was closed
Shane posting just saved my hope for humanity ❤️
This guy needs to go away and stay away.
I've missed you. 💞
Pasquale’s Pizza is Chuck e Cheese
Nick DiRamio's commentary is 10 times better. I said what I said.
My wife loves you been watching since the beginning keep creating. You have saved her time and time again. Pulled her out of a dark and I thank you.
SHANEEEEEEEE ILY 😘😘
The absolutey personal sex talk in the beginning has me dead
i an incredibly disappointed in ANYONE who likes or supports him
Man I glad hes back 🙂
Shane I missed you !!!!
I’m so glad Shane is back!
Shane lowkey bullies Ryland
These fuck ass documentaries are getting TIRED!! We are not in 2018 anymore 😒🙄
So we're just gonna forget about all the disgusting things he's said and done?? I don't care how many times he apologises, there's is NO excuse.
I truly appreciate you and your videos, your a good person! I’ve been watching years and years and I love when you post new stuff x
Food videos!!! Yesssss!!!! I agree!! Any content you put out we want Shane.
I don’t think anyone wanted another conspiracy video
Chris is Toby Flenderson
Gonna start a podcast just to make money huh
His dream about ryland having a vag can be your mind thinking ryland as the “girl” in the relationship. Dreams have a lot to do with what ur brain thinks about throughout the days & since ur brain never stops working it carries those thoughts into ur dreams
Missed this
Please come back! 😭
What if they make the pizza, cut it while it’s doughy and then cook it and the reason they are all different sizes is because as it cooks it expands?? Idk sounds dumb
Ryland is like the drunk friend in the back. Hey hand me another slice. It’s good. 🤣🤣. Missed you guys
i love you shane we missed you you look beautiful
The fact that there are still people who support him is revolting-
You all are so ridiculous. Unreal. Desperate to have your favorite YouTubers, so as soon as they say "all is well now" y'all just forget everything this man has said and done. He hasn't done shit to help the situation. He hasn't done anything to show he's different, that he's an ally to the people he marginalized to say the least. The inappropriate acts he made children do for his videos, not a single thing said or done. Y'all act like all he did was say some bad jokes. Shame on all of you. Sad lost souls, one can only hope you will grow the fuck up. This man should have his platform stripped.
“All of our guests left”  Meeee with THE snacks on the table.  🦀🦀🦀
So apparently everybody's just cool to forget all the shitty things he's done? Come on guys
I missed u! So happy ur posting again!!!
Hiii Shane!! Missed ya! 🙂🙂🙂
What’s the word of the day?
Honestly I truly miss your conspiracy theory videos the most and would always make my day. Miss you Shane!
make the podcast pleaseeeee
Ryland isn’t 🅿️
It’s the 🅿️ for me
Please stop making videos
Tight throat energy
TPE
Is this the same guy who did all kinds of creepy stuff towards kids?
“Before you know, you don’t know”
This video truly made my heart smile! 💜💜💜
there’s probably parasites in the pizza
i was actually loling, luuuurvvvv
GO TO ST.ELMO COLORADO ITS HAUNTED AF 100000%
Shane is still my lord and savior idc bye...
I'm so happy your back on YouTube I love you! Thanks for making my day !
Use your new communication and try and reach out to Eugenia Cooney again. She’s not doing good at all, we’re all worried about her Shane
god I missed u sm
Anybody remember that this guy literally asked 12 year olds to twerk for him? https://youtu.be/eg52SJiT3r8 He should never be allowed to have an audience ever. He can live his life, fine, but why do we let people like this continue to have influence over minors?
low-key hate watching
why was this not in my recommended section wtf youtube
I’ve been going through a really hard time lately and being able to watch a new video from you has helped more than you could ever know. I haven’t laughed like that in such a long time. So happy to see you again! And Ryland always make me smile when he is in your videos too. Thank you guys!
*playing with keys* “what was i talking about?!”  FELT THAT.
Yessssss Queen I’m here for the conspiracies, I’ve been watching your old videos to pamper my conspiracy addiction
Me in the Chick-fil-A drive thru line today watching this. Shane says he's gonna do conspiracy's again. I scream and drop my phone. I made such a scene the lady at the recite booth asked if I was okay 😂 I have missed you shane please make more videos. Nothing is better then eating a snack and binge watching Shane's conspiracy videos. 👽 👻 🍕
Didn't know I needed this video until I saw it.  These videos always make my day.
So happy you’re back, but mostly interested that Chris is into bears.
Not Shane still blasting chuckecheese and saying sorry after every joke 🤣🤣 I love your humor! 😂😂😜
I hope you see this!!! Your pig mercy was on Netflix!!! Cheer season 2, one of the girls was wearing it and I was like omg pig that’s THE pig. I know this pig! So glad to see you back.
That jacket gold and black jacket looks cute on you Shane. I wish you would get dressed more..
What the f I thought you got banned from YouTube
please post more :( <3
Yesssssss almost an hour long!! Let me kick back and relax ❤️❤️🙌🏼
i'm ready for the conspiracy videos!
all you have to do, is fly the right colors and you are forgiven regardless, ain't that right shane? nice clickbait, since most of us were hoping you were being sued by a victim of yours
Shane should do a vid where he visits Jeffree. I miss them together lol ❤️
Shane you will always be my favorite I love you 🥺🖤
Boring……..
When ryland made the honk comment I was HIGHLY offended 😭
I forgot how much I missed your videos 🥺 I have had a bad day all day, now While watching this video I’m uncontrollably laughing and honesty feel better. Thank you
...we're really just letting this clown pick up and continue like nothing fucking happened?
Love that you are so uncensored now because you dont really care about brands 😅
Lets point out the urgent care behind you at Chuckie cheese. Just saying.
Son of a BI+ch!!! Anyone else get totally stoked for a very brief second with a ▪️Shane reply? I squeaked out a joyful yip… quickly realized it was a poser with no subs. I am crushed.
the amount of bickering and shade between them .....its tense
Pizzussy.
I need a Shane & Jeffree Reunion please! ❤
Hi Shane! I have been watching your video since 2010ish... I know it's not gonna happen but it would be nice to have old friends reunion?? I mean, you had lots of things in the past, maybe lots of them aren't talking to you anymore, but I think some kind of confrontation would be a good series. So many people were accusing you for being a bad friend (which has a point) but I think it couldn't be all bad, and talking about the time while you guys were friends, how they feel about you now would be something people want to watch.
🥰😍🥰😍🥰 Yay!!!!!! He's back!!!! Bring on 2022 Shane Edition! Yassss!
Don't agree with what he's done but, his humor is what makes me stay. Upload more please!!!
I was expecting so many hate comments, just being honest. But I am genuinely glad that's not what I see. Or maybe I didn't scroll enough. Which tbh, who does lmfao. Point is, I'm glad to see everyone welcoming you back and embracing you with open arms. People forget that you are human too. If everyone got their lives documented, 75% of the people "cancelling" you would probably have a much worse.... record.... idk the right words. You get what im saying shane. Welcome back. Ive been here since the beginning, and Im happy you're doing better. Please continue to bless us with your content, but always make sure to prioritize you. Without a healthy shane, what do we really have?
I'm so excited for you to come back 💓  😄 you make my day, never fail to make me crack up 🤣
shane should try making his own pizza
Colorado is a democratic state
Bring back the Shane Dawson conspiracy shirt! excited!
18:42 Dude, I do get it 🤣 I've never heard anyone else say that and for a brief moment, it's nice to not be Isolated in such a horrid reality. To actually have a moment to even celebrate and recognize making it here is an accomplishment.
no-
Matpat did a food theory on the pizza! It’s apparently due to the weird pizza cutter
thank you shane for posting
Its nice to see you so happy now loved this  video :D
Shane, I think it's great that you have a channel again and vlog. The energy that made you do all those crazy things in the past ended up poisoning and almost destroyed you, which made me unsubscribe your channel even though you are a very talented person, this made me really sad. Now here my honestly meant feedack to the „new“ you. With all your experience and what you went through you are a predestined satirist with good sketches in my eyes, but just in a mature and qualitative good way. In my opinion the new vids are too close to the old Shane again, which I don’t Iike anymore. I will gladly subscribe to your channel but I’d really like to see some improvement first. With that being said, I wish you much success on your way and remember I watch you 😉
You should do a docuseries with Britney Spears like you did with Jeffery, Tana, and Jake Paul. I feel like it makes way more sense than Oprah. It’s the chance for her to show the real her and be more comfortable. Plus it would be a great response to her sister going on Call her Daddy working with a huge YouTuber.
Yassss queen
I need Emma to watch this lmao
This was entertaining and I enjoyed watching but why would you get three large pizzas and not eat it 😒 such a waste of food. It wouldn't be as bad if you let Ryland order the medium as he wanted, but you made him get a large.
You did this to yourself lmfao
is ryland angry that Shane is bi? Wtf was up w the vagina comments?
You need a surprise wedding!!! Planned wedding are so played out.
Heres a thought.... is there a way to date a food item to see if it's all cooked at the same time or not...?
I don’t care what anyone says, Shane is obviously, visibly, more happy. :)
Put captions then put the video to 26:13
The only other explanation I can see is maybe its cut before its cooked for it bakes and rises in weird directions...but idek if that's possible
As long as u don't bring back wacky taste testing videos I'm good. I love supporting you! relax and remeber comedy is a safe space!
I love that he’s back.
Shane cures my depression.
Shane's reaction to Ryland pointing out how Shane used to "honk" was the funniest thing 9:05
Ok so what, is mine a multiplayer or something?
I missed you Shane!!!  I’ve literally never laughed this hard
I miss you
$80?!!?
So happy you’re back!!!!!!!!
Food videoss!!!
This is a super uncomfortable video to watch when you're a guy who actually has a vagina....
I’ve literally not been watching Shane in ages but welcome back!
I’m so happy you’re back, Shane!!! Hope you’re all okay! ❤️
🖤
Oh wow
yall know this pizza is frozen right and it is likely precooked and separates in transport to them and they just cook it in the oven to reheat it. thats GOTTA be the answer lol
Also I’ve actually laughed so much during this video Shane like you guys are effortlessly funny the chucky shit is so funny I can’t
15:04 😂😂😂
I love your video I’m happy your back on YouTube ❤️❤️❤️
my grandmother passed away Saturday so im late to this video, but this is the comfort i needed. i missed you Shane, and im glad youre back ♡
Shane I feel like our humor is literally the same and those that get it get it and those that don’t don’t-
It’s whoever is cutting it, they cut more slices than Pizza Hut or papa Johns does those have 8 slices and that looks like 12
When he said the 2022 joke I lost it because I fucking get it 😅🤣🤣🤣 we made it 🙂💥
king of youtube is back!!!!
YOUR BACK
SO happy to see you back boo!! 💓
i needed this content back in my life 😂
Shane come on.... Chris-Crumbl was right there 🤣
Would you do a mukbang Shane?
Welcome back big brother!❤️
Another video...
I’d eat it lol
I love that there's an Urgent Care next to the Chuck E. Cheese
I actually didn’t get a single ad in this entire video. No one wants to touch it ✌️😄 On another note, my family ordered Chuck E. Cheese to go from the store. It was a dead time, only one other family in the building. We took the pepperoni pizza home and it was mismatched but that kinda didn’t matter because it was delicious lol
I would listen to any podcast you decide to put our Shane! But I’m so hoping you bring Jessi back as your co host! You guys had such amazing chemistry. But I’ve been waiting for this podcast to come back for yeeeaaarrrrs! My prayers have been answered! Haha
Omg i missed this
The Rynussy.
Ask them to not cut the pizza
This was so freaking funny. I loved it. Thanks Shane 🤣❤
“I did it for a L-“ living ?
You should interview Bunnie XO if you do podcasts again I think youd really mesh well with her and shes a very interesting woman
I love the way while filming this video, Urgent Care is in the background! 😂🤣
Tbh the chucke cheese bit was funny but the fact that the intro with your brother was never brought up again was kinda disappointing. I get that intro  alluded to the podcast but that definitely should've been solidified by revealing your brother as the first guest or something other than just speculation.
we don’t want a new conspiracy video shane, we want you to get off this platform. i was your biggest fan for a really long time. just leave it.
I missed you shane....
Shane! You are hilarious and quick with the come backs!!
37:43 I can’t 😭😂😂
This is exactly what I needed! You can serve me this Shane all day..the pizza not so much 😬 (dont sue me chuck)
Your PR team is really pulling out all of the stops.
soooooo funny I've missed this so much <3
I would sooooo watch your podcast!!!!
The o reilly song 🎵 🤣😂😂😂
God I love you Shane
Shaaane! I am soooo happy that ur back!! I love u more than most people do!!!… i have mutiple fan-merch from u, and i love u soooo much.. but please stop with the clickbait-titles! Ur true fans will always watch ur videos, but I think that the clickbait-titles are beyond u at this point. We love u so much shane! Ur supporters will always have ur back ❤️
I literally got covid from here lnao
Shane, I am so excited for your content again i’ve missed you so much!
Wow so I guess everybody just casually forgot all the shit this musty dude has done?? Lmao perfect. I guess J ☆ can come back to?? Since y'all just be letting anybody back
I’ve missed these videos so much😭
Title sucks. Last little series sucked. Don't want to hear about Rylands vagina in this one. Nice try tho. Maybe next time. I'm shocked I used to like this channel. BTW that robe I bought ripped into shreds, still mad I got sucked into that marketing scheme.
I fucking love you man I’m over here cracking up with you guys through a screen lmao, I’m glad you’re back
The “where are they now” had me in tears 😂😭 I missed them!!
I love you so much Shane.  I work a high stress job, and I use your videos to relax and have me time. I feel happy and relaxed every-time I watch your videos. You make my day. I don’t know what I would do without you <3  you deserve all the joy and calmness in the world.
Damn you really fell off 🙌
The fact he has to disclaim emma chamberlain didn’t send them the mug or associate with them is so sad. Love u Shane
The urgent care in the background during the ChuckECheese part killed me.
If it ain't the "P" it ain't right.....lmao
This guy should be canceled
Do they sell the pizza by the slice? They do at Sam's and when you go up and order a whole pizza you can wait for a fresh one or have them Frankenstein a pizza out of the individual slices under the heat lamps. Just my thoughts.
I would so do an interview with Shane! Love all you guys. Thank you for entertaining and all that you do. ❤
Shane has never eaten little Caesars pizza Bc my location can’t ever cut a pizza right like they don’t cut the pizza like won’t tear apart or they make the slices so uneven
Lmao! Shane 🅿️ all got started because of the rapper Gunnar’s song ‘Pushin P’ personally I like the rapper DDG’s version better. But yeah it started from a song lol
Shane almost gets sued.  *does it again*
So happy to see you back!!!
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢 perhaps bisexual In public .. but this frickin creep oh my .. how is he not canceled ? Not sure. Y’all fans need to research this creep more ..like 20m of you follow him ? DISGUSTING
i havent laughed so hard like this in AGESSS im literally so happy that ur starting to post again rlly miss the conspiracy theories luv u
i miss shane so much people need to understand the past doesn’t define who you are today. I hope he starts posting up again❤️
Chucky Cheese should just stop giving them to people cut
Okay first of all there’s a line that doesn’t even match up with the rest of the pizza @37:33 sooooo lmfaoooo
I just missed Shane content in general I don’t care what it is lol
BRB ordering chamberlain coffee
Thank you for coming back you all been missed . conspiracy theories love them please do a few xox
I'm so so happy you are back!! ❤️❤️ Can't wait to see more from you!
Shane can you be a little nicer to Ryland or have you fallen out of love?
I am like chris laughing the whole time while watching the lovebirds
please fade back into obscurity
When Ryland is on the phone, Shane and Chris sound like cousins laughing while you're ordering food😂
My notification came in 6 days late for some odd reason but so happy you're back, Shane !! Can't wait for more. 💛 Love you !
Didn’t miss him, he can be happy and move on with his life without the internet. I’m still disgusted about what he said about little kids. I hate how he used rylands channel to slowly be accepted again in the media. “Isn’t it crazy to think of me having sex with a women” it’s crazy that you can talk about how hot little kids are & just say it’s for “shock humor”.
The disclaimers 😂
WHY IS EVERYONE SWITCHING UP DID WE ALL FORGET HES A TERRIBLE PERSON?!
I'm Ryland eating all the pizza not caring where it came from 😆
Shane, you a G.
DO CONSPIRACIES AGAIN WE ARE BEGGING YOU
nah nah go away
I WANT A DISNEYLAND VIDEO NOw
Laughed so hard! Can’t wait for more of your video’s 🔥
😍
I missed you guys!!!!!
Yes we get it 😂😂 that killed me
40+ minutes of absolutely nothing No effort no direction. Just wasting everyone's time.
❤️🇩🇰
Something about this video that literally cures my depression
Buy a chucks cheeses pizza cutter and cut a pizza
Yessss Shane I missed you looking forward to the new conspiracy videos 😊
Why the hell are you still here?
p is from a song called pushin P lol
This is simply amazing!! 👏 🥰 💌 On so many levels 📸🎬 Kind fights & Night lights 🌙⛅️
I’ve missed Shane so fucking much, the videos where it just feels like we’re all hanging out. I missed him
Shane, I haven't laughed so much in a long time, please do a follow up and order the pizza uncut!!
I loved this so much! Happy to see you back!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
No way you guys are letting this man come back to youtube with his bs theories 🙅🏾‍♂️
These comments are so mind boggling…
WHY! Why wasn't I notified about this 6 DAYS ago!?
Missed you so much. Your content makes my day so much better.
Um the clip of what your brother said at the start (sorry I'm like 5 mins in and commenting lol).. I THINK ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME. GAME. THE TRUEMAN SHOW. ALWAYS. But like.. obviously it's not, just reality sucks and I WISH I was just some sick game lol
I want some Shane Yaaastified  conspiracy theories merch!? I'd go broke
"at good will... Buying my merch" I screamed 🤣 I saved this video for my pamper night 💕
Yayyyyyyy more Shane Dawson 🥰👏🏾
You should have got one stuffed crust! The crust is the main wonky part, from not connecting-sticking out further
Honestly, I get it. Wasn't expecting to be here this long, but hey, it is what it is.
Does Chuck E. Cheese sell individual slices of pizza? That could explain why the slices are different sizes. They’re not necessarily left over from people that didn’t finish them but they take the pizzas that has the individual pieces taken out and piece them together to make a whole pizza???   SO glad you’re back though, I love seeing you in Rylands vlogs so I’m glad you’re back in your channel! Give us more videos like this too! I want this!!
During the panorama chuck e cheese dropped a bunch of songs its uh interesting lol
Go to Peter piper pizza instead. It's a better version of Chuck e cheese except the pizza is fresh & follows covid guidelines instead of reusing trash pizza
Yaaayyy your back 😍 good to see you happy. I'm a new mum and today was having a hard day & watching this made my day❤️
DISGUSTING
I have been away from the internet for the past few days and when I come back this is what I see!!! Pinch me! I'm so excited! I've missed Shane videos so much.
dear Chris, I love you that’s all
SHANE! I’m so worried your about to get sued again 😢 but no seriously your doing them a favor at this point bc I HAVE NEVER HEARD OR READ ADVERTISING FOR CHUCKY CHEESE since I was like 10yrs old and I’m 35yrs old!!! So they should be grateful 💜
so everyone forgot what he did now or something..
I cried watching this, I miss this so much
Whether u love or hate him u can’t deny his docos all slapped!!! I’m happy he’s back
So I’m wondering if you had a dream about Ryland having a vagina because you guys have been wanting to have kids. Maybe it wasn’t at all about you missing women, but more-so part of your manifestation to become parents? And possibly even a sign that it’s coming soon? (Vagina - Womb - Birth - Parenthood)   Something to think about. 😇
Do they cut the pizza before they cook it??? Like what
Always look forward to Shane videos 🙏🏻😩🥺😅😅😅😅
I love Shane but I wish he did videos like he used to i.e. life hacks and classic scary videos. Still loved this vid tho. Glad to see Shane uploading again. Can’t believe I’ve been watching for 5 years now.
I love this. I genuinely missed Shane.
“If you guys are watching this video you get it 👀” no because I do babababab 😭
Wait you spent 80 on those pizzas?? Lol
This is EXACTLY  what I WANT.... i miss you and your videos
After everything is said and done this video is hilarious
You know what shane reminds me of. A teacher who knows you failed horribly and he's like you're doing great sweety, but you have some problem areas. But nice hair. 🤣
Soo, I worked at Chuck E Cheese for a few months, ate there pizza, and saw how it was made (I never made any of the pizzas since I was 17). The slices are not shaped right (less than an inch) due to the pizza cutter AND the spiked roll that helps it cook evenly. It would sometimes roll into a not so perfect circle. It’s NOT recycled.  It’s fresh and good.
I love how the ChuckECheese is opposite Urgent Care 💀
I love this for Shane !SLAY😊
I’m sorry but where is the whole simulation theory video, it just feels like that’s what you advertised in the beginning..
for as much as i dont like him, hes like super entertaining and i really do wanna like him /:
10 min in and Shane shows up in a truck, says he dreams about vaginas, talks about avengers movies and wants to do a podcast. Too much straight guy energy here
The rambling on about the pizza in the car at the end was drawn out and annoying
Just wait till you come to terms with yes that voice is you,everyone else and god.We are ONE
thank you for being you!! Every video I watch has me uncontrollably laughing 🤣 I've been watching your videos since I was 18 I'm 30 now 👀. Keep being your goofy self.
We need a Shane Dawson podcast!!!
Lets not do the p thing lol😭😂😂😂
💖💖💖
Shane will always be my safe place
Ty for everything Shane
OH MY GOD I LOVE CHRISSSSS AHHHHH HIS PERSONALITY IS SHINING THROUGHHHHH I HOPE HE STAYS FOREVER
Love this sooooo much😻😻😻😻
"a mix." HAD ME OMG
Watching this literally put the biggest smile on my face this last year has been so hard and seeing you thriving and looking great and just in a completely better mental space has given me so much hope for this year ❤️❤️
9:55 - 10:02 KILLED me lmao glad you're back Shane
🅿️🅿️🅿️
Fav videos lol
i’m sorry but this man is insane
I missed this
Make a entire YouTube series about planning your own wedding, and have Jeffree Starr officiate the ceremony!!! That would be epic.
Omfg I’m actually screaming shitting pissing crying and dying rn no fucking way SHANE IS BACK I’m loving life rn
finally
😭🤣🤣 omg this was hilarious! Please upload weekly!!!🙏🏻
Can you please make another Mandela effect video?!
The pizza isn’t put together at Chuck E. Cheese, that’s just how fresh pizza looks when made. I know this because I watched an episode of kitchen nightmares and Gordon Ramsay was helping chefs make fresh pizza and it looks just like how Chuck E. Cheese pizza looks 😂
Its a no from me. Just stop here.
Hey shane, love your videos so much especially the conspiracy ones I just heard about another conspiracy called the hum, you should look into it its really interesting 😊 x
I like real videos, where you are yourself.  And you look skinnier!
So I worked at Pizza Hut and we would take it out the pan and put it on a cutting board 👀👀👀 but it would still line up
The jokes were hittin!
Not gonna lie, I had to take a step back from Shane for quite a while with recent events and honestly I'm mad at myself for; A.) Not being as openminded as I should be and  B.) Not going into watching is video positively.   I came to hate watch and I'm mad that I was smiling and laughing, but I realize people change. People grow from their mistakes.  When the video was over I realized I needed to try again.   Shane, I hope this year is for growth and prosperity for not only you, but for Ryland and all the people you interact with. I'm looking forward to seeing more from y'all!!
I wanna know WHY every employee gets so heated about this conspiracy 😂 like a strange level of angry
laughed so much, keep them coming 👍🏾
All I want is anything you create that brings you joy. You being you is the best!!
When he brought up the 🅿️- that had me 😭
I miss you idc do you bitch keep the ticc skin
this was so boring shane just quit already
AT THE IT PART I STARTED LAUGHING AND ALSO JUST HAD SURGERY! IT HURTS BUT I CANT STOPPP 😭🤣
I don’t care what anyone says,I grew up with Shane Dawson.His conspiracy theories and ghost hunting paranoia videos always made me think I could be a lawyer or an investigator 😊
Probably gonna get deleted, but you can use me as a dislike button 🙃
I'm sorry did Ryland say that three large pizzas cost EIGHTY DOLLARS!???
Late to the party but these were the vibes I needed today, thanks y'all~  Looking forward to whatever's next! 💙💙💙
I love this man so much   Never stop posting man please ❤️
i was having a really bad day until i watched this. i will always love you!!
You guys should have a pet pig maybe. Would be nice.
Had a courthouse wedding with 3 friends. 5 minutes and boom Done. I still cried
HAHAHA wow I missed these videos
I'm honestly so glad you're back your videos got me through a lot of hard times and they always made me smile and not surprisingly at all they still do <3
I am so happy you’re back!!!! I’ve always loved your videos. For years. Total icon.
Hell yea more conspiracy theories Babyy 🔥🔥🔥
omg i have the same thing with my eyes lmao i talked to the doctor when i went to get my eyes checked and he just said it’s a muscle defect
Taco Bell does weddings
I have missed videos like this!!! This is perfection!!!!!♥️ thank you!!!!
It doesn’t even matter what kind of video Shane makes it’s legit not ever not funny .
You dicust me
Literally laughed so hard! I forgot how alike our sense of humor is!😂😂😂 Thank you for this. I need a video everyday!😘
shane, i’m so happy you posted, i havent laughed this hard in a while, i needed this, i hope there are more videos soon
This is the Shane I love & missed. So funny & always puts me in good moods. Been watching since 2012 & never stopped. Love you always Shane. Never stop being you!! 💕
Chris is funny
It makes me uncomfortable how much Shane discusses sexual topics with Christopher. I feel like it makes Ryland uncomfortable as well. It seems awkward.
I've never been to chuck e cheese
Also if we going back to food videos ; waffle maker ???
Shane you have no idea how much you lighten up my day with your videos, I’m so glad your back!!!! Missed you!!!!!
❤
Awe I’ve missed y’all so much ❤️
I needed this. 45 minutes of non stop laughs.
A Domino's ad came up in the middle of them opening the pizza boxes ☠️☠️
Ryland shoving the butteknife in his pocket has me cracking up, this whole video was hilarious 🤣🤣
You da Man Shane ...3 amigos over here
clickbait title
PLZ MAKE TPE MERCH
PLZ MAKE TPE RNERGY
Pedophilia, beastiality, racism… y’all are still simping over him?
Watching your vids always puts me in a good mood! Can't wait for the podcast!
Why did YouTube send me a notification for this video 6 days after it posted
goofy
I’ve missed these kinds of videos!!! Shane always makes me happy
I love u 🤟🏼 and I’m so happy u are finally back 😂 we made it 2022 !!
I’m very depressed and this helped.
I really have missed this Shane. I’m glad he’s posting again.
Do you reply? ♡♡
I’m glad you took a break bc you look so happy and Chris is back to❤️❤️❤️
i love you and shane and missed you so much, you helped me through a lot in my childhood and i’m glad to see you making videos so i can watch you while i’m starting to enter my adulthood❤️
I do get it and we did make it 😂😂😂
🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️
I’m sorry but my honest opinion is, I thought I would give you a second chance because everyone deserves it. But I had to stop the video after the Mexican reference. I know it was just a joke but the humor you claim to have learned from just seems to still be there. There isn’t anything entertaining about you anymore. I mean no harm I just think I’m gonna have to pass on your content from now on.
OH MY GOD YOUR BACK!!!! 😊❤️❤️❤️
I hate that chuck e cheese got rid of the band 😭
Absolutely love that Shane is coming back.... But Chris needs to stick to The Sip, the giggling/Screeching is so Annoying!!
oh n remember when he in appropriately touched animals??
go to hell rot in prison
Loving your positive energy! So happy and very excited for your future videos 🖤👀
Look if that little person in my brain is the one responsible for this can I have a different one please?
we love you shane u don’t fail to put a smile to my face no matter the past ❤️
I want the money pants and the jacket please
Too early for Britney Spears digs.
i am so happy that you are back!
Order an uncut pizza !!
still watching shane is my guilty pleasure-
Hi
The Ellen show turned on when watching this
Absolutely loved this , you are such a mood this entire video lmao 😂 Love you so much Shane ❤️
11:51 14:48 #cancelIT
I missed this sm. These better be weekly I stfg Shane 🙄😂
Dumbest video ever
Shane, love you soo much. You're videos have always been a source of joy for me. You're the best❤️
I’ve missed your videos Shane !! I’m glad you’re back 🥺♥️ thank you for this, I really needed this. The humor, the vibes, everything. I hope you post another one really soon !!💕 can’t wait for everything that come next !! Love youuuuu 🥰❤️‍🔥 ps I’ve already watched this video 6 times. I just love that you’re back 😭
missed you bae
I love you Shane & Ryland just be you and never let these karens have any impact on you, I just can not get enough of you guys missed your videos so much! CANT WAIT FOR WHATS TO COME NEXT 😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰
Our cute little Colorado sweetie ❤️
Ok i have gut feeling that he is deleting comments
Okay Shane, on a real note. WE NEED MORE!! my belly hurts from all the laughing
It seems like the pizza cutter is used and when they recut over the lines they already cut, they more than  likely shave a little sliver off of a the sides of a bunch of slices. Those slivers are not given to you, hence the uneven slices.
Chuck E Cheese pizza is NEVA it fah me, I'm not sorry. It's way to weird.
Lmaoooo “preach brother” killed me
This is so chaotic but also everything 🤩 welcome back Shane ❤️ we missed you!
stop disappearing on us shane
I feel like because Chuck E. Cheese sells pizza by the slice when someone orders a full pizza they just put the single slices together and reheat it and that’s why it’s uneven
I relate to shane on many levels, but the biggest one is that everyone also hates me. lol
This is 🅿️
🅿️
Shane is pushin 🅿️
“get ready for daily uploads”  doesn’t post for 5 days
Video starts at 19:19  You’re welcome lol
I tried watching this and enjoying the new camera man and everything just... idk now I'm uncomfortable
Actually, I was hoping for far more maturity, not a small amt more.
Chuckecheese is about to come for yalll again 😭😭
we miss you so much, I can't wait for you to start posting more
I would be so into watching a Jamie Lynn docu series
looking forward to you uploading again <3
I'm really sick of Shane acting like he's a victim. I'm sorry after seeing what you did to those children..you don't get a victim card.
Shane being back on youtube makes me realize that better days are coming
hope all your hopes and dreams get taken away from you xx it’s crazy that this disgusting person is allowed back on youtube
At least there is an urgent care across the parking lot....
What a pervert...
Why
Shane really ain't into homeboy...not natural so..it's impossible to romanticly be In love when yall are the same sex
Literally just what I needed to get me thru today 😫😘 thank you shane!
As a Conservative Republican myself, I can appreciate the pick-up truck.   But it's a Ford so it's still pretty gay.   Glad to see you back man.
yayy me and my whole fam always watched shane
this shit has too much gay enragy
I wonder if you could order a pizza uncut, cut it yourself, and then see what happens....🤷🏻‍♀️
Plz make waffle iron videos!
The guy behind the camera fake laughing at everything these two say is cringe worthy. Add in Shane thinking everything he himself utters is funny and you have a recipe for losing subscribers. Try harder to provide actual entertainment. On my way out.
Shane is so off the cuff funny and the video editing always highlights his humor brilliantly. Love seeing you ease your way back into my notifications! ❤️
You made me crave their pizza, so I went and now I'm having my own :P
So glad Shane’s back !!! Screw cancel culture ! I got shane back now I need Jenna marbles back !!!!
Ryland is literally his biggest supporter and deserves the world!
“Señor Poooh!” Omg I can’t 😂😂😂💀
I had missed you Shane 😭
@ 27:52 Ryland looks like Millie Bobbie Brown from S1 of Stranger Things 😭😭
Shane you better upload more videosssss
Ryland is definitely a Taurus from start to finish, lol.
$80 for three large Chuck E Cheese pizzas? Nah. I would not believe more than $50.
TPE!!!!!!!!!!!😂😂😮‍💨
does anyone notice how much shane disrespects ryland in this video?
Shouting Shane does a series with Britney and her fam😂😂
Ok hun we soon get through this
I haven’t watched Shane’s videos in a long time & I laughed, I remember that I love him!
🅿️
I can’t wait to see more of your videos!!! I’ve missed you
Hey Shane I started watching you out of their young age I had a lot of access to the Internet and I just wanna say you made my childhood thank you so much I was told you stop posting so I never got to watch you in the last like four years but thank you
So, I kind of enjoyed this 45 minute video of you basically going, "I'm gonna do a podcast and Chuck E Cheese pizza is still sketchy," but... don't do it again.
pushin 🅿️
I love how a chuck e cheese is next to a urgent care 💀
I love you Shane
The way I’m laughing right now should be illegal 😂
You should have told your fans to call and complain and say they will never eat at chuck cheese if they sue you 😭
Do a podcast interviewing digital princess !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your manifesting Vaginas because your mind is telling you to do a podcast about digital princess !
PUSHIN P IM CRYING STOP IT SHANE 😭
"let's get you into that suit" Bwa hah hahahahah!! Ryland is so hilarious. I am still laughing!!!
Be careful Shane! I love you so please be careful 😂😂
if you still love shane you are anti Black...
wack
Excuse me did you say you spent 80$ on 3 pizzas from the garbage ?
"hey Chucky, we made it!"
I missed you Shane!!💙💙💙💖💖
We made it! 😂 I felt that so hard!
is you start making podcasts can you post them on spotify too
I’m so happy you are back! You help me so much with my anxiety♥️
YOU FUCKING CAME BACK AND ARE FUNNIER THAN EVER HOLY SHIT
missed you hope you’ll be posting more often ❤️
SHANE IS PUSHIN P 😭
leave. Youre everything thats wrong with youtube
Imagine them putting slices together from different pizza's tho. IF they have a default slice cutter that they use on every pizza, you would not even notice the huge gaps and differences in slices. So this still remains a huge mystery
HERE FOR TPE
I'm straight girl but love hanging out with gay guys because we can relate
I started watching this when he first posted it, it's now 5 days later and I'm finishing it lol
That pizza didn't have TPE (tight pizza energy) 😅 I laughed so hard during this video. Thank you for that. I can't wait to see what other videos you put out and I also can't wait for the podcast!
I am thrilled about a shane podcast. I’ve missed him.
I missed you so much and your content heaps, love you heaps Shane !!!
Are people turning a blind eye to what happened..?
Missssed watching you! Me and my friend had a day watching your new vids
It’s not fresh pizza. Little Caesar’s gets the same way if you order too far after lunch time. Fresh pizza is worlds away from that BUT is it better? That’s to the person. However I fresh pizza dries out  Dried out pizza shrinks
Thank god you r back...I missed you so much ..love you Shane❤️🥺😘
So glad you’re back Shane. Thanks for this and for being you ❤️
Ryland is me with my bf 😂
I am so happy that you decided to come back to youtube and your gonna get back into conspiracies!!! I’ve missed watching your videos so much!!!! I wish you and Ryland love and support through everything!!! I AM ALSO WAITING FOR THE WEDDING VLOG !!!!
I miss these sort of videos, so glad to see you back an happy !! Lots of love to you guys xo
I watched it half heartedly cuz of all the drama surrounding Shane, tbh the jokes about p**** and such were in my opinion in bad taste cuz of the situation.. Shane I really hope to see you do better in the future
Literally been having the lowest time recently. I'm a mum of two and struggling with everything I.E... life 🤣  But haven't laughed like that in a long time. Thank you 💗 love you Shane
First of all the 🅿️ is pushing p… the song. But as for the pizza my theory is that they cut it before they cook it.
Doesn't make any sense? If we are a game why TF would somepeople decide to play as an accountant doing taxes? OoOoOoh That's sounds fun.   Truth be told it doesn't matter, you are your own person with a conscience so that makes you real game or not.
Order one and tell them you don’t want it cut 🤣
Is Ryland high?
Yelling the word “f****t” when you’re gay is always cathartic af
Really needed this ❤
just please god dont do a podcast with Ryland
Use this as a dislike button. 👇
👏
So happy you are back. Loved this!! ❤️❣️
I'm so happy that you're back I've missed you so much! It's crazy to think now that you're in Colorado I have a chance of possibly meeting you!! I've been watching you for years and you've just totally changed my life, I love you!! ❤
I think you need to do a podcast!!! I loved when you had a podcast!!! DOOOOO ITTTT
shane you honestly make my day complete, so glad ur coming back <3
I love love love Shane Dawson !!!!! I don’t care what he makes :)
hi Shane!! you posting again is just what I needed. I literally freaked out when you said you're considering making another podcast! your last podcast show got me through the loneliness of my high school depression. thank you for showing us how possible it is to recover from being on the receiving end of what you received. you are strong.
You can literally see the half sliced pepperonis..
Was not expecting to get that notification
With the snippet at the start I've always said life is a simulation and in our head and I'm glad that conspiracy will be made soon
I laughed out loud a lot I need more
Not Shane Dawson or should we say his real name Shane Yaw trying to be interesting so we can forget about all the disgusting & illegal things he has gotten away with HAH! https://youtu.be/FfRsJgblnas
I bet Ned and shanaynay would know the answers to this. Bring back Shane and friends.
I missed this, and yes Chris is now called Christmas
Makes me so happy seeing new video from Shane, keep em coming 🥰
Просто интересно, какой у райланда айкью…. Потому что с момента его появления я не видел ни одного подтверждения, что не отрицательный……
Hilarious!!!! I am so happy you are posting again!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Welcome home king 🤴
clap if you care
This video is 🔥 lol
Shane‘s ✨new quote ✨when he gets ✨sued again ✨by Chuck E. Cheese’s is gonna be “if a pizza could get Covid it would be a Chuck E. Cheese pizza😏”
This video was the funniest omg I laughed throughout the whole thing
Why did this give the vibes of trying to get back together with an ex but it’s still the same… When Ryland said what did you think they were going to do..?change? that just sent me over the edge lmaooo😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣
Bring back the style of the old conspiracy videos plz
15:46 There is a person's head peeking behind Shane's shoulder
I have to wonder, if you picked up the pieces and rearranged them they’d fit. Maybe they purposefully swap two slices round for the drama
Well...I was excited for his return but this is the same old Shane.  I'm really disappointed.  I was hoping he'd mature just a tad.  The Ceelo crack at the end was what sent me back. Too bad what a waste of time which you could have reflected.   We want to see you, not a caricature of you.
First a picture of Jenna Marbles from behind and now Shane is back?! My week has been made 😂❤️
This video mad my day so much better. I was in a dark place but I started rewriting your videos and it made me happy again and thank you :)
I worked at Chuck E. Cheese and I was told to collect the left over pizzas and put them back through the window to the kitchen so they could be disposed of correctly.. just saying.
Is it all really that funny ..uggh
shading chuckie cheese on the down low
Me at 12:47 almost shitting my pants when he said Emma (as a person named Emma) not knowing he would say that 😂 I didn’t expect it lmao
Their reason is bullshit. I've gotten pizza from probably 30 different places in my life and none of them are messed up like that. They all fit together cause it's the same pie. I'm happy i've never eaten at The Rat
Love how urgent care is in the background
I can smell it.
@Shane Do have those Conspiracy Jacjets for sale? I had'nt seen that jacket before.  I WANT IT🙂🙂🙂
Shane, I missed you so much and I am so glad that you are back. Your humor literally gets me through the hardest days. I cannot WAIT for the conspiracy videos!!!
I don't know how everyone seems to have forgotten everything you've done! Your a sick horrible man and you shouldn't be allowed to have a platform https://youtu.be/V7rdPrOt6kI
Thank you for the conspiracy videos coming back I've honestly been checking more than I'd like to admit THANK YOU
I love Shane and I will never stop loving him. I never ever stopped. Shane is legit the realest person that has been on yt since it first got big. People are so soft and can’t get over themselves. Shane is baeeeeeee
bruh
omg i love pansies 🥺 my favorite flower 💓 keep uploading bae i love your hot sweaty stench 😍😍
i didn't even get this recommended to me. I had to search it up. Youtube must have seriously blacklisted him
I love the humor in this video
I love you
Y’all switch up so quick I swear
clean the pizza sauce off yourself please. One Love <3
We don't have Chuck E Cheese in my country but based on the pictures I see why are their pizza slices not symmetrical to one another? It really does look like they were just putting all the leftovers together to make one ugly looking pizza.
I love u guys
I missed and love watching Shane so much !!!
I saw Shane merch at the swap meet the other day. It was hilarious
Omg I'm so glad ur back 🥺🥺
So excited for you!!!
Next time I order pizza from them I will request uncut pizza lol
Love you Shane, thank you for making this video, you made my day better 🤍
8:27 He said: 👁👁
Three? Years? It’s been that long already ?
But also wouldn’t the crust be like that because they roll out the dough themselves instead of it being like a frozen pizza lol and then just cutting it weird?
Lmao 😂😂 shane is so funny one of my favorite people ever tbh
So…did Chucky come for you again? Hahaha
0:06 I LOOOVE that video with his brother 🤯
It’s so good to see you smile Shane 💜  Daily vlogs, food videos, conspiracy theories; I will watch whatever makes you happy to post!  You seriously make my day when you upload ❤️ Love you 💜💜💜
King is Back♥️🤗🤗
$80 for pizza wtf
Instead of Chris Cringle - its Chris Crumbl
YAAAAAAAAS 🥳
“He we are a blue state we aren’t repub” -Colorado
Omg hi sweetie, you’re doing amazing 💕 missed you !
i wish this video would last whatever. i miss you shane
❤️
I'm sad I got the notification 5 DAYS late!!! All that time WASTED WHEN THERE WAS A NEW SHANE VIDEO OUT!?! I'm ashamed. Watching is making me feel better though.  😌 yes yes yes yes YES TO THE PODCAST!
You guys should just elope and do an “after party.” Weddings suck. If I were to marry again that’s what I would do.
....so we aren't gonna talk about it? Aight.
After a long day !! I needed this 🤣
16:20 LMAO
😂😂😂
Are these comments filtered or did y’all forget this man did literal b@ck f@ce? 🤨
Oh crap this creep is back on you tube uck!
Ryland I know exactly what you ate talking about. He did it after every pig joke. I still want a pig backpack from Shayne. I love his humor. Crazy to think I have been watching him for 10 years
please contact euginea she’s so sick maybe she would listen to you, even though you used her as a prop for you videos
No because i definitely agree with Jared. I had a experience like this whole high, it completely changed ne
"oh oh oh  Ryland woman Parts"  😆
From the start I felt like the mob against Shane was extreme. I’m sorry but in 2009 we were all cringe and all said “offensive” things. Only difference is we didn’t have an internet presence. Also a lot of people on the cancel Shane-train were like 8 yrs old during 2009 and don’t remember how it was then.
Started binge watching shane dawson when I realised he uploaded this. Really helping me go through corona rn, thank you so much 😻😻😻
P.s WHAT DOES CHRIS LOOK LIKE?😂🤔⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Please marry him  soon I want you to to have a happily ever after.!! <3
So awkward watching this and I work for c.e.c knowing the pizza isn't mix matched 🙃
God your so handsome SHANE DAWSON 🤔💋💐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Next time ask for the pizza not cut or cut in squares
I worked at Chuck E. Cheese it’s the way we have to the pizza that make it look crazy
I could listen to you talk all day I am literally losing it laughing so hard 😂😂 tight throat energy got me crying
Y'all need to watch the Food Theory video on this.
Damn, come on Chuck E Cheese, fix yourself
Alright so I laughed my ass off let’s not have us wait three months for some more laughs because Im gonna lose my 🅿️
Don’t know where I’d be without shane and his videos. I literally love you
So we just gonna forget about what he did?...
wait did the chuckee cheese almost lawsuit actually happen or is it a joke
SHANE I got your March LOL can’t wait
Shane ! I also feel very indifferent about my self sometimes , I have high highs and low lows.  But watching you and Ryland has helped me distract myself for a little while. I love y’all , I know I don’t know you for real but I feel like we’d be friends.  Any stay positive always and trust yourself !  Creativity comes and goes ! You both got this!
I’ve been manifesting a podcast now we get it .. ⏳
Sigh. I'm always late to leave a comment. But Fresh Slice pizza is like that too and it's because they dont use pieces from the same pizza because some people order just 1 or 2 slices only. So when you order a medium or a large pizza, they might just be taking the leftover slices that are already in the window maybe? (PS I am Canadian and have never been to a Chuck E cheese but if they allow people to order by number of slices than ya).
😂 I love this content
So this is the guy that sleeps with animals and finds rape funny f you Shane
We want anything you make Shane!!! Love you🥰
I’ve missed you so much, Shane! I love you so much. Making my day every single damn time! 💜
It’s great to see him happy after all the crap that happened to him.stay happy man stay happy.
The conspiracy is probably one of the stupidest I’ve ever heard…. He’s literally just describing a metaphor as if it’s a very profound reality.
Loved this video. Can't wait for your conspiracy video and I am thrilled to hear you say Aliens... Yes!! There has been a lot of weird shit in our sky's Shane.... LOOK UP!!!
I love thisss, I lovess you shane
Were probs not gonna get another vid in like 10 years 😐
♥️✨🌼♥️✨🌼♥️ Glad you’re back
You know, you can just go to the court house. That's what my husband and I did. Keep it small, wear a fancy pair of jeans and a nice t shirt. If large formal wedding stress you out, you don't have to get one. Also, you can just like make a zoom meeting and invite people that way to your wedding. Their are so many ways to do a wedding now.
I definitely am here for conspiracy video hope to see those coming soon yesssssss
y’all I worked at Chuck E. Cheese for like a year the pizza is like that cause there’s a stoned 17 yr old making it in the back
I live for Rylans energy in this video😂😂
No seriously what the faaaaaack is going on with that pizza 😂😂😂😂😂
Omg it’s so crazy how I’m also thinking of starting a podcast and I’m a cancer too! This is my sign to actually start it😎
Ryland - my husband and I got engaged in 2004 and finally got married in 2010 lol
Iron-Pig or Pig-man
It being a simulation doesn't excuse you liking kids.
Could you just like request the pizza uncut 😬😂
How did any of you find this enjoyable
What if vaginas meant rebirth?
ryland is a flamingo for sure
What happened with Shane and Jeffrey I want to see them
i’m sorry but shane always came through when i was in my hard times, people make mistakes, i love  him
Yay! Awesome to see you back, Shane. Just do videos that you enjoy and don't get swept up with serious videos. It's nice seeing content creators having fun! I look forward to more conspiracy theory videos!
i’m pushin 🅿️
That’s why there is an urgent care in the background.  In case you get sick from the floor pizza
Y’all can definitely put me in the guest list! 💜 love y’all! Always making my day 😊. And I think you should definitely post the video of you speaking with your psychic! Let them haters hate cuz “WE MADE IT!” 🤪🤟🏽   P.s. I also love everyone who supports Shane’s channel.
I love that there's an Urgent Care right across from Chuck E. Cheese.
I love your galaxy pizza video, the spider part lmao
Pizza slices are sisters not twins
I missed this. But why am I not getting your videos ? I have to hunt for them. If the Tea channels didn’t talk smack I wouldn’t have seen this.
Someone should do a video of shanes camera man or camera men laughing or snorting lol
I am shane. He and I must be related. And Ryland is my husband. Lol I mean same personality
i forgot how much i laughed with shane lmao
Hes gotta be deleting comments
I'm so glad your back the fkn internet is boring without you!!! I love ryland but he's not on everyday! Lol sucks when your dying an bored an an nobody cares😔😔 so I'm happy your back I finally get to smile sum
A shane video? Finally man. I left YouTube when you did because it felt so... off.
Have we ever thought that because chuck E cheese sells singles of pizza + pizza buffet, that they just make fresh pies and then as slices get sold, they frankenstein fresh pizzas together when they get full pizza orders?
It's fucking cringe that he's acting like this at almost 34 years old
”Im a different person” entire video is filled with sexual jokes , this dude had a big problem .
It’s PUSHIN 🅿️ Shane 😂
Love it  Shane " I'm back baby"  Me " he'll ya mf"
I have never actually had a pizza from Chuck E. Cheese that was edible.    They have always been the worst pizza I had ever had.
Shane: We should have a podcast. We should have Lori on!! OG fans: Umm....👀👀👀
Soooo happy you’re back! 🤩 I’ll keep manifesting daily uploads or even weekly uploads. You’ve been missed. Never leave us again & please don’t make us wait months for a new video again. Love you, Ryland & Chris!
I wouldn’t marry Ryland either, he was annoying me during the first part of the video
damn baby my player is bad at the game 5 senses go crazy b
"Should we tailgate" is the most Colorado thing LA has ever heard
Nobody really wanted him to come back, we want Jenna Marbles. Go back to fucking pets.
This comment section is 90% bots
As a trans guy I have now come to the sudden realization that i need to find myself a guy like shane XD
OMG!!!! YES! Please do a podcast!!!! I am so into them now. Since I don't watch tv and it's getting harder to find good content on YouTube podcasts are my jam!!!!
Shane, I’m really trying to enjoy your content but you really gotta work on censoring yourself and tightening up your editing. I’m nearly 13 minutes in and I want to exit the video so badly
It wont load for me 😭
I feel like Shane and Rhyland have some issues 😭 rhyland is always passively aggressively talking about Shane watching p*rn, being attracted to women, not being married yet, like damn
YES PLS MAKE A PODCAST I LOVE THIS
Former Chuck E. Cheese pizza maker here — just to back up the theory — the pizzas are handmade and hand tossed so sometimes they come out as an oval opposed to a circle. They don’t use the traditional pizza cutters that is used with only one hand, they use a two-handed cutter. Cutting the pizza 100% evenly can be a bit difficult as mentioned in the video, yes this particular pizza cutter has some weight, also when the kitchen is ran by 16 year olds it can get very hectic and the pizzas would come out in all sorts of shapes LMAO, but never reused. The location I worked for at least was pretty sanitary and we did not recycle pizza :)
Why did Shane remind me of Cal Jacobs at the start😭😭
I’m craving pizza now.
The beard suits ryland so much
Everyone remembers what you did Shane.
Shane changed for the better. Ppl aren’t rocks they’re organic beings that notoriously make mistakes. If I can forgive my father for leaving my childhood due to his decisions, I can forgive shanaynay heck let’s forgive bon qui qui while we are at it and demolish systematic racism by educating ourselves and understanding cultures and how they came to be
finally, another shane dawson video
Omg ,I'm so happy to see new material with Shane ( your awesome Man, keep making videos ,I especially love his conspiracy theories. You are the buisness
god, i have missed shane's videos 😅🥰
my bf made pizzas at Chuck e cheese in hs and he said it's false at least at his :'(
I missed this Shane so much. I was laughing the entire video. I’m so glad you’re back. ❤️
I’ve missed laughing with you guys in your videos so much, so happy you’re back💜
Pizza thing is a myth, buy yourself a pizza rocker, cut a pizza, and I guarantee it’ll do the same thing, I’ve cut several pizzas and it’s done this
I hate how I watched a very problematic person do absolutely nothing productive in a 50 minute video, and ate up every fucking second of it… I am a part of the problem…
I get it🖤
i missed shane 😭😭 i love watching rylands vlogs tho
Shaaane, Shaaaaaane! If you don't like weddings, you don't have to have a wedding to get married! Please don't let this sit there, because you somehow feel obligated to plan a wedding. Just get married my dudes!  You deserve the ultimate best. Start acting like you do... and proceed to do so ~ until you believe it too! ♥
Review on the Chuck E. Cheese In store pizza 😵‍💫
U pushin 🅿️
The disclaimer killed me
I was scared for the chuck e cheese stuff FOR THEM
80$ for 3 per owned  pizzas is ridiculous
Shane you really should do a podcast. That would be awesome. It is so good to see you back.
NOOO GO BACK I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONE PLEASEEE GO BACK GO BACK
Anyone else realize that ryland cut the same crumble cookie twice?? Around 7 min in the video
Shane @ 32:10😶  😂
I always feel very conflicted watching these videos. Like, I know we cancelled Shane, but the nostalgia is winning. I used to really enjoy his conspiracy videos. I don’t know what to think.
Unfunniest and the least entertaining thing you have ever posted. In watching this I came to realize that you were never funny— but instead the people you surrounded yourself with and mistreated. Now that they have made the best decision in leaving you, you are left with dry, snore-inducing humor. I hope you do get the help you need, but I think it is time to consider retiring the camera. Best of wishes, though.
Omg podcast! Yaaaasss!
Why can't I stop laughing?
The acronym TPE already has a meaning. Yall might wanna look into that before yall start branding. 👀🤣
Big yikes
the anticipation starts @ 31:40 😭😭
Please review Jeffree Star Skin
tf y’all sayin weirdos
LMAOOO WE MISSED U
please get off the internet
Ryland in the background just nodding and eating pizza is a mood
Will always love you both ♥️
guys don’t act surprised or upset that Shane  probably has some virus that puts bots here 🤣 we know he does weird shit and we’re gonna love him for it.
WAIT I HAVE AN IDEA….. order them and ask them not to cut it and see what happens…
Is rylan getting jealous of the camera man
Boi if you don't get off this app rn
Shane is really out here liking and replying to bots lolol
I'm so happy Shane is filming again 💕 love this video I wish all the happiness for Shane and Ryland thanks for the laughs 😂 ,I'm excited for the podcast I loved Shane's podcasts used to listen when I worked lol
Chris is gay? I thought he was straight
This was a more if a reminder to unsubscribe
So if the pizza isnt recycled why the fuck aint it a perfect circle. Theres no way
my stomach hurts from laughing so much😂😂
I've missed your videos so much
10:00 OMG
I miss his characters like Aunt Hilda but that will probably get him canceled. 😔
It's like he gets funnier and funnier as he gets older. What a wise man
Shane is a perfect example of how my mind runs a million miles a minute 😂
My friends dad was a manager at Chuck E cheese and..... he admitted that they do in fact recycle pizza when I said ewww that's fucked up  he said waste not want not  And shrug his shoulders lol he said they save so mich money cause alot of pizza doesn't get eaten and why throw it away wjen they can just resell it he also said they   get away with it because they put it back  into the oven and the heat kills the germs  and burns any hair or other things that might be on it from interaction of other people tables lol   Idc I won't eat no recycled pizza cause skin flakes boggers eye lashes  and anything else can fall into the pizza at a kids bday party and the oven burning it off isn't enough for me to eat after complete strangers and dirty gross little kids lol  Also my legs don't match my torso either 🤣🤣
3:24 in the video. i relate so much Shane 🤣
Damn. That shit was ass!
This is wild to me bc my high school friend who passed away had a notebook of “impossible thoughts” and his first one was we were all in a video game simulation. He was also heavy into psychedelics tho so lmao
y’all should just have a party and have a priest there and call it a wedding
Everything your videos used to be and more! The same sense of humour the same creativity same mind same loving caring Shane that we all missed so dearly ! So much love Shane so glad you’re exploring new avenues that make you happy ❤️ Another great video that made my year !
Hi, I'm a viewer from Malaysia. I'm going through some difficult times where I have to be apart from my boyfriend until September. It's been difficult for me and I found your video. I'm so happy you're back cause when I watch your videos it lifted my spirit and I don't feel so empty anymore. I just wanna let you know your videos are more than just videos to me. Thank you so much Shane.
how does this creepy pos have a platform still?
Make a podcast with canceled alum!
Before you know ✨you don’t know✨
i still cant tell whether or not this guy is serious, we are not in a simulation
Oh I missed you! This helps after a long day💛
If you have voices in your head that aren’t coming from yourself something is wrong. That being said you can also make your conscience/voice in head come from another point of view. If it isn’t intentional than something is wrong.
Omg a podcast with Shane Dawson conspiracies 😪💗thank you
Ah this video is literally about nothing.
I had to take a double take because I haven’t seen a post in so long! Welcome back!
YAY SUMMER SHANE SEASON IS BACK
4 days late unfortunately, but this was very well needed. Thank you for existing Shane ❤️
It’s the Iron Man in the ending for me 😌 very 🅿️
so we're all in a simulation playing a game and my character just lays in bed & watches youtube?  Ain't no way
Sènor Pooh 😂
shaaannneee ilysm
Eating crumble cookies too!
this feels like a 10min vid
Now we need Jenna back now tooo
I'm so excited your making videos again I missed you!!!
Phuck Colorado. ...I've been here forever and it's truly a crap hole.
“TPE” MERCH PLEASE 🤣🤣🤣!!!!
i love shane’s series’ so fucking much omg
TMI !!!!!!.
Why does Chris rock the money suit!!!!???!?!
Shane is so FUNNNNY I LOVE HIM
I don't think that's the main reason you should be banned from a kids establishment
I never got a notification 😕
UR FUNNT
I’m crying I never stopped loving u lmaooooo
nah he’s totally deleting comments cause this is not it
Miss you Shane!!!
Can you please do a video of all your favorite documentaries I FEEL LIKE YOUR LIST WOULD BE REALLY GOOD DOCS
This brings back some forgotten nostalgia before it al went down and I’m here for it.
if we were in a simulation we wouldnt even think we were
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL
Yeah .... The reason why people find you repulsive is because of Chucky cheese pizza.  I'm fucking dead
EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE, all has dirt in their past. Your just won’t be brought to light bc your basically a nobody! Your not famous so luckily, if you weren’t caught then yours will be forever a dark secret of yours! Leave Shane alone he’s definitely a better person than 90% of all of you. And has made better of himself than all of you .
the fact conspiracy theories are coming back😭😭 they were my life for the longest time.
Ive missed  this shane
Gosh I missed this tho! I wouldn’t mind the daily uploads 🤣
bro literally molests cats
The tpe moment lmfao yes merch
You have no idea how much I needed this! My dad died recently and his birthday is coming up, so I’ve been going through some depression. I’ve been watching you for such a long time and I’m so happy to see you posting again! I haven’t genuinely laughed so hard in a while, so thank you! ❤️ can’t wait to see what the future has in store for you!
this is such a fun happy video! i love it! so excited to see new videos from you!
Glad your back bud,can't wait to see some new videos
Shane, you are fucking hilarious I'm so glad you're back
YES to conspiracies coming back YES to food videos coming back SHANE YOU ARE SPEAKING MY LANNNNG
10/10
You guys were on another level in this video and I absolutely loved it 😂
Oh jamie had me on the floor 🤣🤣🤣
Shane can i firstly say welcome back you have been missed. Hope everything is well love u to death. Keep ur head up 💗💗
It’s so sad everything has to have disclaimers and stuff😪
I am so damn glad that you're back, Shane 🤩🖤
Loveeeed this, I could watch these types of videos all the time! ♥️♥️
Feels like he’s taken the best from SDTV era and he’s remade himself into what we all got hooked on him for when we subbed over 10 years ago
25:39 I can't stop laughing at this
Shane we love you king ❤️
I was hoping to see just a little bit more maturity...  He could do "good" for others, if he were sincere, help EC again. I guess no more make up?
please god bring back Bo Burnham To the podcast 😭😭❤️❤️
"As long as Ive been pounding that fucking pu-" WHERES CHEETO
So happy he’s back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can’t believe Shane Dawson is back
You really, really should have stayed away from YouTube.
Welcome back. Check on Eugenia
Shane,, I fucking loved your old conspiracy videos. I get some hate for still enjoying your content,, but honestly if you started a podcast with some nights being conspiracy nights I would defiantly tune in.   I don't think people are shitty people forever,, idk if you're self-aware in privacy,, but I do think you're trying to change. I do hope you're aware of what went wrong in the past and are aware and getting help for it.
Its so weird think that i first watched shane back in 2009, was only 15, and went away from home to go to college, and now its 2022! Hard to believe its been 13 years!!!
Shane sucks
stoopppppp the disclaimer made me choke lmaooooo
Im sorry why are the comments being positive did we all like forget what shane did?!
SHANE i am so so glad your back you are funny caring and just overall brill dont ever change and let your inner queen shine forever more
i love shane but poor ryland😂
Ok but the title is kinda funny because of the controversy,but im sooo glad shane is back🤩
jeez :/
Love the video. Please don't take 7 years to make another one
You know, I did think this was crazy but then again don't they sell individual slices too? Maybe the patchwork pies are from them trying to use up the old first and whatever is left of one from selling individual slices..... not as funny to talk about but still tasty lol
he still "honks"
Shane is better now
His vids are actually very well made now
I am 14 minutes in and the entire video has been about sex... I mean at least your consistent.
Love new videos 🤞❤️
I missed you Shane 💖
ew
19:00 I get it.
I'm I just too stoned or did you change the title to this episode. 🤔  Can't figure out which is the case here 🤯
this is so annoying. the chuckie cheese pizza theory has already been debunked. i know it’s a parody but it’s not funny, it’s just fucking irritating. not only that, but everyone in this god forsaken comment section seems to be choosing to forget what shane did. it’s just disappointing.
Welp..definitely gonna be saying tight p****y energy from now on!!! 🤣😂
This is everything I want! Well, ya know in a Shane Video ;)  Can’t wait to see your Podcast come to life! And I bet you could get ELLEN to come on, ya’ll should DM her and Vlog it all including the response. Even if she says no, we can still see the process ;)
I wonder if anyone ever tried to order a pizza at Chuck e Cheese unsliced? That could be interesting. If they refuse to sell you a unsliced whole pizza that would be very suspicious... ...another conspiracy video?
Wow how much did they pay you guys to make this !,???
Did y'all forget what he did
my serotonin levels went up I missed this … 🥺 your videos made me happy
Omg iv just been watching the marvel movies
Marriage is overrated ... just do a ceremony under the stars ✨ like we do it in the forests off Australia
Yewww Shan Man long time no see ,  still lookin good....
Bisexual Democrat who sexualises – and speaks inappropriately to and about – children; what else is new?!   Shane, you’re a funny man but you’re a bad human being, and you’re going to Hell unless you repent now.
"You still have your odd shape but so do I". 🤣🙌 37:08
I saw a tiktok of an employee making pizza and cutting it wrong
Lovee you shane! Soo so happy to be watching you you hilarious personality <3 never dull your spark youare the bomb
Omg STOP!!! it hurts... 🤣🤣🤣it's been so long since I GENUINELY laughed this much for this long... Hmmm... come to think of it... Note to self: cancel tummy tuck, replace w/ 2 hrs of Shane Dawson videos/day = The REAL definition of bougie on a budget!!! YAAASS!!! LMAO
Shane subconsciously misses being straight
$80 on 3 pizzas 🙄 especially from there 🙄 idc what state u at, that's a rip off
Go work for them and find out.
I don't care what anyone says, I still love watching his videos ❤
To see ryland turn green with envy is priceless 😂
Shane: BI... BI... BI...  ME: Bicentennial!!! Hahaha
Omg I've missed Shane videos!!!! Couldn't stop laughing. Love it, keep em coming!
Ryland ruins every video....🙄😒
"We never get past a guest list because all of our guests left us."
Okay I’m not American and have never been to a chuck E cheese in my life. But I feel like this makes sense which is more logical. The reasons why The pieces don’t match is because they are from different pizzas but not in the way people think. I think the employees cook pizzas before people order them so let’s say they make 10 pepperonis, 10 cheeses and etc. so they arent constantly making pizzas cause when they are busy they don’t have time to make 10 pizzas right there and then. So they bulk make them before people order them and put them away and I guess reheat them? That’s why the pieces aren’t even especially when u order half pepperoni and half cheese. Cause it’s from 2 different pizzas. I don’t know if any of this made sense.
Lmfaoo Shane ily I missed ur humor in my life 💕 good to see ya
Ryland knowing the O'Reilly auto parts jingle is absolute conformation that he is a CO native. Damned radio/TV ad was so overplayed in this region.
Okay, I'm done. See you in another few years again. Can't wait to see you because you're screwing yourself over what the hell. What is this not okay
Love that Urgent Care in the shot while they eat the pizza
The camera man 👎🏽👎🏽
RYLAND HAHAHAH
funniest video i’ve watched in awhile lmao thanks for the content
"Before you know, you don't know." 😂😂😂
Haven't laughed this hard in awhile. Never fail to cheer me up Shane ❤
Shane…I missed you
Plz order an uncut pizza 🤔
you look so happy, I love ittt!!!
This was hilarious, I missed you!
Ok but I’ve missed watching your videos. Haven’t watched you for a year now I believe. It’s crazy!
Ryland is an otter
SHANE PLEAAAAASE DO STAND UP
pushing 🅿️
i actually went to chucke cheese today! tbh the pizza wasnt even that bad...it didnt look too bad and it tasted kinda nice 😳 the only thing i think they need to worry about is there security...bro deadass someone pulled out a gun during a fight. there were literally two fights in the span of 2 minutes, lol
😆 same. “We made it to 2022”
i love shane he has helped me through so much for the past year glad to see his humor has not changed!!!
Shane we have missed you dearly!! I’m so happy that your posting again! Don’t let the haters get you down. Your amazing!!💕
🤣always so effortlessly hilarious shane. Been laughing at your jokes since day 1. Hope you're going well 🥰
43 minutes of shane dawson trying to avoid a lawsuit
the house will be sold as "Shane/Ryland Memorabillia"
We miss you. The people who hated you never watched you or understood you to begin with. You lost none of your fans. You just found some haters. You can't like this comment because somebody will make a video about it I understand. Sending luv betch.
You can elope! My husband and I elope in Iceland. It was just the two of us :)  I am so happy that you are back Shane!
I’ve missed you so much!!! 🥲🥲🥲 welcome back Shane!! 🤍🤍🤍🫂
The deal or no deal music when you were opening the pizza box 🤣
Love you
Chunky cheese is most definitely not pushing P 🅿️. Also listen to the song “pushing p” by Gunna maybe you’ll understand better
I am dead lmao! Keep the realness and genuineness 👏🏼 Adam and Eve let’s go lmao  I love you both but Ryland has that tight pussy energy! 👏🏼🥰💃🏼
Been watching since literally your first video, your Shanaynay days. Love you Shane!!!
I wonder how derkslurp and shane would get along?
ITS the urgent care in the background when they’re in the parking lot FOR ME 😂😭 OMG Ive missed Shane
kinda felt uncomfortable to watch at some points
Love you Shane, thank you for coming back 💪🏻
So everyone should starting throwing away there plate in the garbage so they can’t do this 😭
I loved it.  I love that you're back and I loved every minute of it. I also enjoy the more vloggy lifestyle side of you from Ryland's channel.
I love how there is an urgent care in the background while they are in the chuck E cheese parking lot Lol
Ryland truly stood by your side in all of this.. if you don’t marry him istg
At 19 minutes.. 😂 yeah… we did make it 🥲
The "2022...yeah not gonna be there" Is what got the like for me on this video 😬😅😅🤣
Thank god your back! Please never leave us again Shane!
Ryland is such a  little cutie when he's waving by3
He tried so hard to have a happy ending with chucky
im 2 mintues in and i missed you so much. my fav bi, bi-costal queen. <3
At Ryland sayying preach brother instead of sister
making sure to only watch this once and not refresh so this gets as few engagement points from me as possible :)  and then negating that by typing this comment :(
Everybody knew about Chuck E. Cheese pizza or what ever he is being sued for . Super Irrelevant! YOURE DOING GREAT SWEETHEART KEEP ON SMILING
He woke up n said why is she green?! I died laughing! All about that TPE drop it asap! Love it Shane n Ryland it's so a thing, I think lol.
"if ur watching this video, u get it." YES SHANE OF COURSE WE GET IT.
This is why we need dislikes
Shane dawson channel is growing while onisions channel is dying no this can't be
At shane being the reasonf half the restaurant locations shut down in ontario
My ex used to work and Chuck E. Cheese and when i asked why the pizza was shaped like that, his response was “you try cutting a bunch of pizzas fast 😂” so yeah I guess it really is the cutter
Omg you guys I just figured out we have a crumbl cookie here in the heart of the South 25 mins from me I'm going immediately as soon as they are open...weeeeeee
idc what type of content you put out im watching ....all your content is excellent
Chucky Cheese is not pushin 🅿️
I missed you Shane
I just love you soooo much xoxo yay great to see you doing your Thang. Love peace and making magic
You made me not wanna kill myself in the darkest of times you awayyyys put a smile on my face fuck your past people are allowed to change and adapt ffssssss just really remember we all human baby

This video is P 😂🤪 welcome back ☺️ had some great laughs to this - thanks lol
Not pushing 🅿️ JK since Shane is back he is pushing 🅿️👍🤘
We miss you Shane love England XOx
Only Shane can have me smiling and laughing for 45 minutes straight!!
JUST SO YOU GUYS KNOW… SHANE SAID NAKED BABIES WERE SEXY! Fucking Google it. I’m disgusted and unsubscribing IMMEDIATELY!!!!!
I really appreciate Shane continuing to stand up and emphasise that he’s bi, even though his forever person is a man. Who you’re with doesn’t change who you are
Such an interesting video.. Welcome back Shane!
P is slang for Pushng Pressure(drugs), Pussy power,(from gunnas new album) so you are technically manifesting P as i'm watching this xD
Keep it real queen your amazing and I love you
I’m confused $80 for pizza and you can’t make a perfect circle??
the person sitting and controlling my brain is a pot head. fer sure.
Omg I needed these laughs
34:05 not Ryland calling his fiancé brother 💀
I also miss your old ratchet good videos 😁
19:00 we get it.. LOL
You should be a Republican… you’d make better choices 😊
No one would want to play the game of my life.  Sorry, but this theory is so far fetched
Oh my god what if he leaves him for Morgan!
Seriously can’t get over how much I miss you and I miss this
Thank you from the bottom of my heart I’ve been replaying all your videos and no here’s a new one to watch 30 million more times❤️ we love you and we’re ready for you whenever you’re ready for us
This is exactly what we wanted shane
Idk but I’m fucking pissing myself and I’m only 5 minutes in.😂
I bet Shane is gonna leave  for a woman give it a year
i seriously cant believe how people dont understand that people chnge. as disgusting as it was, dark humor was the NORM and it was acceptable back then. yall need to learn to accept that poeple grow and move on.
i miss his conspiracy vids :(
Cried laughing as you tried the pizza. You guys are so funny and brighten my day. Welcome back!
Shane.......u can LITERALLY make ANYTHING SUSPENSEFUL! I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE INTERESTED & ANTICIPATED what a F'N pizza would look like in my life! I have laughed thru this whole video! WELCOME F'N BACK!!!!!! I'M OB-SESSED!!!!!
I've been watching Shane ever since I was a kid, scary thought I know 😆, and he has this sort of sense of humor that can't be matched by anyone.
this reminds me of that one episode of icarly with the tech foot
That was actually a really great video. Welcome back Shane!! ❤
I missed this Shane , im glad you are back!
I’d love to see you talk about Scientology in a video!!
I couldn’t stop laughing 😂😂
It’s a mouse tho lol
So glad for Shane to be back. I needed all the laughs this video gave me today XD
Ryland in the Christmas dress has me crying and laughing so hard.🤣🤣🤣😂
Don't ever go away again Shane. People miss you!!
This feels so nostalgic. Like, 2016 nostalgic. I love it so much thank you for this
Literally everyone is a bitch , everyone gets offended over different things . What May offend me , May not be offensive to others . Stfu and say what the fuck you want Shane , there will be a problem either way so why not just fucking be happy and stop watching what you say all the time .
I love it and I love Shane suck a cure smile! Ad u back!
fuck why was that an actually funny video.. 🙃
I live for Shane Dawson but this is bullshit. Jesus is the one up there making sure we straight.
I love this video!
Omg when the were going on about 🅿️ I was thinking the TPE merch could use it!😂💀
You should do some tik tok recipes for your ratchet food videos!!
I am sooo FUCKING HAPPY that Shane is uploading again. I dgaf what anyone has to say or your negative feelings towards it. I couldn’t give a crap less about that. I want more videos so happy for you Shane
🥰 actually chuffed you’re back Shane!
Was he exaggerating when he said $80?! I sincerely hope he was 😂😅 (Don’t come at me lol I can’t always tell because I’m Autistic)
So happy to see you back💜💜 love your videos
This video had me laughing the whole time!!!
I love youuuu!
I hope ur next conspiracy video is about illuminate seeing how they are being exposed for andrenochrome and human trafficking the 13 families o Shane plz do it
emma is gonna sue next
They should’ve opened it upside down to see the bottom but still never gonna eat it lol
I havent laughed this much watching a 40 min video. Its good to have you back shane
This feels like a better Shane, one we didn't know we needed. You look great, love the videos. Can NOT wait untill the conspiracy theories and podcast ❤️
No lie! When I was 18, I got drugged at a chuckecheese in Columbia South Carolina. Craziest experience ever.
I personally don't care about conspiracy videos so I love this. Please make more vids like this!
“Made me republican😦”- had me dyinggggggggg
That first pizza reveal was shocking. 😂😭 I believe it but every time I see it I’m shocked by how bad it is.
I seem to be more fond of Rhyland as each video passes. It helps that he seems to be maturing well.
Exactly what I needed tonight! So happy to see you back again!
it is good that shane is back with his humor and all, but if you are back full time lika before disclaimers or not watch out with uyour jokes because a disclaimer is not necesary a fast pass towards not getting sued, just watch out from now on because people aout there are waiting for you to mess up.
Bruh there fried😂
Shane OMG! I've been watching your channel for years and it is so amazing witnessing your growth. I mean you sound so confident and you sound so happy! You aren't being mean to yourself and I love it and I love your channel and I am so happy and proud of you!!!
Dude just leave yt already💀
I love u again❤️❤️❤️🧡 I miss you! You not a bad person! I'm going to support you all the way and Ryan❤️🧡❤️🧡❤️
I feel like chuckie isn’t going to take this very well lol
Imagine they get married and Shane walks out in the chuck e suit 😂
Ryland eating the pizza trying SO HARD to not get sued lolol
Thank you, I haven’t laughed that much in a while!
I luv u even tho ur a democrat nothing could Eva change my love for u I'm forever a fan
I literally just DoorDashed some Chuck E. Cheese and got a half and half. I'll let y'all know what happens in about an hour 🤣🥴  Edit: Y'ALL. There were gaps in it. I wish I could post a picture. There were 3 different slices that were longer than the rest of the pizza, and the cheese was a different color. Tasted fine, but still sus 🤣
Did they just say that Marvel movies aren’t for the gays… because I’ll have to HEAVILY disagree
The amount of times I laughed in this video is actually astonishing. I LOVE YOU SHANE IM SO GLAD YOU'RE BACK :)
Please do a podcast with kendall rae!!!!
This is everything I needed
I seriously miss Shane so much !!! He has the best content no matter what it is ❤️
So happy for you I love you!!
I cannot wait for your conspiracy videos I’m dying for them omg that moment u opened the box I was like omg “garbage” 🤣 u should do merch with different pieces of your stuff “misfit Dawson cheeses” 🤦🤣
Shane ik thats not a face shield
CC -Traditional or stuffed crust?  Shane- umm mixed?  LMAO!!!!
I love your content. and on how the pizza slices don't match up can be from the cutting board they use. when i worked for shark dining at nova southeastern university. we used to get papa john’s pizza at the private school on campus. we used a cutting board to make the slices. an if the person didn't re-center the pizza every time you made a cut it would push the segments around. in turn making the slices uneven and not line up. so, the real test would be getting the pizza uncut and use the same kind of cutting board at home and see if you can do it.
Omfg I feel like I've just been hanging out with my besties for 45 minutes 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I needed this video and these laughs and this type of interaction and just everything!!! I've had the worst 2 days and I really feel so much better now and I feel like I'm ready to focus on my $hit 😁💖💖💖
I'm so glad you shared this video. I laughed so much 🤣 and it was so nice to see the Shane Dawson we all ❤️  @shane
First off it’s just what I want! Second this is so the IM BACK video!!! (I never left) but.. Papa bear is back ❤️ I miss this Shane! I’m so happy and laughed so hard. Thank you!
I still remember the videos you would make putting random stuff in a waffle iron specifically a fat barbie lol
Shane…… Take responsibility. You’re actions were wrong. “Good intentional” or not (let’s be honest, creeping on kids always. harmful. Never. Funny.) so. How about What I did and that norm that I promoted was harmful and wrong. Then actually stop doing it.  Never will any of what you did be okay. Never. Your mindset on all this is genuinely terrifying. Please get help.
I still want the Conspiracy pallette! I want to manifest a giveaway in a future video 😘💄
Glad to see you back and unbothered > not a bot
yesss i miss your podcast shane! definitely start a new one 🤩
You sound insane when you talk
Laughing as hard as I did watching you 7 years ago! Love that you haven't lost your touch. I started watching you at 11, I'm 18 now!!! You basically shaped my whole quirky personality.
Miss you shane. Plz be consistent 🙏🏼 your vids  brings me happiness
Jesus this guy is a horrible camera man. All these blurs and blurs like damm, just use auto focused at this point.
Always have and will always love you!  So excited for this next chapter!
Okayyy but WHEN the FUCK is the conspiracy video coming!!!! 👁👄👁
80$ for 3 large pizzas??? Wtf 😭
“Tight” 😂😂😂
I just rewatched the conspiracy series. I missed seeing videos like that from shane. And I finally had the money to buy the pallets 🤣
Exactly what we wanted, what we needed, what we live for-YOU! Loved it! thank you...
Im happy Shane is back he did a lot of growing and self healing and I applaud him for coming back and being the YouTuber he's meant to me🤗
My bitch is back …😭 it’s been too long
This is my 13th reason
missed you:(
Rylands outfit on point lol 😝
I really missed you, I can’t wait for more conspiracy theories!!! My friends and I were watching yours last night, LOVE THEMMMM SOOO MUCH.
I missed you!
Id love to wear some of shanes old hoodies tbh theyre so freaking cute
get off the internet you creep
Still love Shane but the republican crack wasn't all that funny....
I can’t wait for more of these so I can have something to keep me entertained at home so I can save money 🙂
Unfriendly reminder that you do not deserve a platform.
Shane! Come back to Colorado so I can see you at the casino!
make a video with britney spears!
I missed you Shane!! So good watching your video again
where are the hate comments lol
We are not in a simulation i think something is very wrong if you think were in a simulation
I LOVE Ry driving the truck
Laughed so hard. Enjoyed every moment
My theory for the Chuck E. Cheese is that the half and half pizza comes from 2 different pies, they put 2 orders together and split the pizza for 2 orders, it’s the only one that really looks like it doesn’t match.
Yo those pepperoni's don't line up right
I'm sooo glad to see Shane back with his great sense of humor!!! Definitely glad to have all the laughs back!!! EEEEK!!!!
I lost it at Señor Pooh 😂😂😂😂😂
New cameraman. Same sexualisation.
The world needs more Shane. ❤️
You should order a large pizza and ask for them not to cut it. If they don't recycle then it should be no problem. If they say they can't do that...then.... 🤔
Ryland: “Before you know, you don’t know”
The reason why it looks like that because when u ask for a mix pizza. They cook the whole pizza and cut  it in half and place one half next to the other half and then cut into smaller half. The other half is set out on the buffet for other to eat. 😘😘😘😜
I love that Rylans the only one eating. How could you not eat any pizza that’s right in front of you
😃me the whole video
You are like Pam Beasley with your 3 year engagement 😂😂
No bill shit I’ve felt this way before!!! Then again I smoke every weekend so it hits me too hard lol LOVE YA SHANE LOVE THE SIRIES!!!
The 🅿️ in the uk is the sign when they gave product placement. So is you “happen” to drink a Starbucks in a video your getting paid to do so .. but you legally have to tell people they’ve paid you. If that makes sense. 🇬🇧
🥰🥰🥰🥰
When Ryland yelped out "let's get you in that suit" I fuckin lost it hahahahhaha
Where’s Cheeto
i love this
I have missed this 😀.
I missed you so much Shane. Your videos bring me so much joy. I was cracking up throughout this video. Don't stop doing what you love!
You being a marvel fan is something I thought I would never see in my life😂😂I love it
Good to see your videos again. ☺️🙂 🧁🍩
RIP PETER MONN
I literally smiled/laughed this entire video! Love your vlogs like this!!! ❤️
Order one without it being cut!!
So glad to see your beautiful faces again! I know it must have been unbelievably hard but I’m so glad to see you smiling and laughing again.
I need to see Chuck E Cheese put out a video that shows them cutting the pizza to see if it still misaligns.
Honestly I grew up watching shane dawson videos especially the conspiracy theory videos. They were always a distraction for me because I was very antisocial.  And now that I'm a sophomore in high school I need a distraction. School sucks
Those legs don’t match that torso… you’re right.   I’m dying. Also, these mofos should’ve fixed their pizza cutting
The letter P means P for pimping so like pushin p, made popular by Gunna’s new song
EIGHTY DOLLARS??? Not even a rat can escape inflation.
Go to jail
I love this Shane plz the videos coming ur fuckin hilarious an add Chris an Rylan yasss!!
wow! so glad you guys are enjoying this guys' content considering he's a freak! welcome back i hate you lol
there's something creepy about him its scary. is it only me?
If there is any parent who still thinks being gay is a “choice” listening to ryland talk about vagina should tell you otherwise!! Hahah I love you guys!!
Um………… no
They scrape the toppings off and throw them together add new cheese and pepperoni. 😂
Im in highschool now and watched shane all when I was a kid (maybe a little too young at the time to be honest) but he really shaped my childhood and I feel like he really just puts out content that whatever  it is it's always great because he made it. His videos helped me get through quarantine  in 2020, rewatching all of them, because thier were none new to watch, him coming out with new video makes me so happy
I assume they use one of those long two handed pizza cutters? It's curved looks similar to the blade on a paper cutter. If so then I could see it being difficult to cut evenly
Is it a coincidence that urgent care right located right in front of chuckie cheeses??
wow subs is similar but view count is going down significantly. He needs to figure things out or he wont have a career on youtube like before.
My husband and I were together 5 years  and engaged 2, we only did it when we did because my niece and nephew were the best age for flower girl and ring boy, if not we may have never done it. I hate dressing up and the dress was so stressful. We are together 25 years now. My point is if you are happy and you the wedding is not important. That’s just my feelings.
I know what you’re thinking “last time we saw him he was a bitch… now he’s a man”. Hahahaha god I’ve missed you so much boo. Welcome back Shaney Waney!!!
OMG we need TPE merch 😂 This video made my day. So funny. My face hurts from laughing so much
Is it just me or has this type of “humor” really completely phased out? None of this is funny. It just makes me wonder why this guy hasn’t changed literally at all in the last 10-15 years on YouTube. Poor Chris, being sexually objectified by his boss. Truly so disgusting.
Love your filming again Shane, I stan for you. Love the chemistry between you and Ryland. Please invite me to your wedding. That's a idea you know have a few fans win a trip to your wedding! Come you can afford it! It would be great content and you just might meet some cool new people. Love you guys!
In TikTok, P actually means Player. You’re a P. Bad.. but in other contexts, it means positivity, etc… make it make sense!!!!
i am so glad you’re posting again. fuck the haters
All I want is a conspiracy video before WW3 starts. Here in europe things getting heated with russia. I dont wanna die without another Shane Conspiracy video.
Idc if it’s Shane sitting for 43 minutes straight talking I love it
i always love ur editing style no matter what the video topic is about. i loved this video!! cant wait for more (especially the conspiracies)
***Also create a new channel that’s both of you and start from there.  A new world.
I love how there long af 😍 I love Shane
I’ve missed you! This was great
Shane and Ryland, in my opinion I think you should get married in you backyard at the lake, when you already have your Alpacas. I think Uno, Honey, Cheeto and the Alpacas could have tuxedo bow ties and you can have just a tiny Wedding with your loved ones, so that you two feel completely confortable and happy in your space and with the persons around you on your special day. I also think you could mix an elegant and funny environment. For example you can have beautiful and sophisticated meals for the main event, and for the late party you can have food trucks coming. I hope you liked my ideas or at least made you smile.❤Hugs from México.❤
***Do a series on leading up to wedding, planning, etc… It would be great and you would end with GETTING FUCKING MARRIED!!!❤️
OMG, Shane I have been throw a tough month because of Covid and I was feeling pretty down, but watching your video made me smile, forget about everything for a moment and made my day happier. Thank you so much. ❤ Love from México. ❤
this video is literally 43min of shane trying to say he wants to start a podcast but getting side tracked every 5seconds and i loved every second of it
I love you
Stop saying it’s not what we wanted! So many of us LOVE all of your videos! I love all your videos and honestly conspiracy videos are my least favorite honestly. I love your chill, funny, vlog, thrown together, just hanging out videos 🤍
*5 straight minutes of Ryland being butt hurt*
11:00
Psalad
Im in for a P tonight Prosecco Pizza
I missed videos from you!!!!
A day before this came out I was watching Shane’s old videos about Chuck E Cheese and then 39 minutes before I got home from school the next day, he posts this lol
Shane is back!! Looking forward to your podcast
Shane is iconic. 3 days and 2.4 million views???
We all know whats going on and what they are doing. Less about you more about them feeling powerful. Fuck the noise, ive been your fan since the hair tutorial. We have so so much in common shane you wouldnt belive it. Seeing you come back really inspired me again like you did in the past. (lost hal;f my body weight in to short a time gang.) Thank you for being you.
there’s a song that says pushing p so i’m guessing 🅿️means money?
Why did everyone switch up on him🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Omg an occasional funky food review would be nice
Why is everyone so happy this asshole is back?? Did everyone forget what he did or something?
I saw a tik tok once a pizza employee idk what restaurant but they cut out a little piece to snack on and fit the rest together maybe thats a reason lol
Ive always wanted shane merch but still at 23 i cant afford it.
Gross. This whole video was more of Shane being his usual disgusting self. 😤  I thought he was a "new person". Well, same shirt, different dirt.
I want this man to be my father
I can’t believe Ryland wore that out! 😂
Omg. I seriously probably need to start keeping shit to myself to coworkers etc. but I have told people about the relative comments to  spitting food in a cup and stretch marks. I just- I mean I'm glad you don't hide stuff like that from us, because I relate so much and I would never have related if you wouldn't have said anything. So, a toss up here on my end, whether I should be as open or not to people in day to day life and social media but I'm glad you said it regardless. Not glad we've dealt with it, but it makes us have a connection whether you'll ever know any of us or me. That's why we watch you, entertainment and some connection.
He almost got sued by the chuckster and now he’s messing with em again 😂
Too bad Tana stole “Cancelled” as a title for a podcast!
So Ryland’s podcast is over for goood?
The ryussy
my daughter got her one and only ear infection after we played at Chucky cheese. My pediatrician told us never to go there. They don't clean their machines and play structures well enough. Maybe after covid, they have gotten cleaner but I doubt it. If they haven't fixed their pizza after the shit storm Shane started last time, then they are still gross and nasty.
So happy to see a video from you! It was very entertaining! Love you guys!!! Hope to see lots and lots more from you. I really missed you 🤗❤️
Glad your back hope you stay .Don't let anyone bring you down.
Holy fuck I missed Shane
If Chuck E  Cheese  is soo worried about this conspiracy and their reputation, then why don't let shane go "behind the scenes" and show him how the pizza's are being made. I mean, it would make a great video.
Am I the only one that thinks ryland reminds me of Linda from bobs burgers. In like the best way!! 🥰
This unironically made me want pizza
So happy you’re posting again, it’s like seeing an old friend ❤️❣️❤️
Beautiful and unique
i have needed shane to come back for so long this has made me so damn happy, glad to have you back, your real fans were always here for you through everything!
That was not hate he asked
Who’s recording?
I wanna know about the icecreammm
This was absolutely entertaining lmao
So happy to watch you doing videos like you used to!! Always cheers me up
Awww miss you guys
I missed you Shane
💖👑✨✨✨✨👑💖
Soooooooooo pissed I missed this video somehow
ugh i love shane so much. i missed him
Miss your vids big daddy bear Shane! ❤️
the dark humor, my favorite humor
The Chuck E. Cheese near me got shut down for awhile because someone shot another person over tokens. 😂
Missed you
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Yes!!!! I missed these videos 😭❤️
PLEASE DO A PODCAST WITH STEPHANIE SOO OMG I WOULD PASS OUT PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
i actually cannot stand ryland
I LOVE YOUR VIDS💯
I can't wait for the conspiracy video with your brother! If you want some more ideas, my mum is a medium and would LOVE to give you a reading. You can film it if you like, unless it gets too personal for you. But if you are interested, let me know. We are in the UK so it would have to be through video call.
I don’t like how Ryland immediately cut the Crumbl cookies into 2 pieces each instead of 3. He was lowkey ignoring the camerman, who literally brought the cookies :/
Shane I loved you since day 1! Yes.. since your hair straightener days!
I want a wake up call when you post your next video a notification is simply not enough
Yo loved it 😂😂😂😂
Side note though, i actually really would listen to a shane dawson podcast...
Dad came back 😭😭😭❤
gross. leave
I haven't laughed like this in a while - this is exactly what I needed, thanks guys
👑🖤
LOVE YOU SHANE!!!
Keep your 12 year olds alway from this man
LOVE YOU AND SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU BACK BBY!!!
What happened to his last camera man? The ginger hair man.
I love this guy!
Once you hear the podcast of Shane saying that babies and 12 year olds are sexy.... you can't look at him the same. Disgusting pervert and he needs to be CANCELED. 🤢
O o o o ryland has boy part ow
bro why are all the comments so positive like....
if the pizza thing is really recycled ill still eat it still taste good
meow meow
This was great, I laughed so much..
I love this I missed you guys this brings so much memory's and happiness
Name the podcast canceled Anonymous
Im so excited you’re doing videos!!!! Thank you for coming back for all of us!!
It’s very good to see you back Shane I missed seeing your videos
jesus i couldn’t even get over the intro for a while his voice is so annoying
More Shane eating videos!
Should do a documentary on Spirituality, hypnosis communicating with subconscious/higher self, manifestation, etc. To see if all that is real?
well deserved
You're right. It's not what we want. Stay off the internet. What you did WAS NOT okay. You havent learned your lesson, you hid until someone else got the spotlight. This isnt even hate, but you dont deserve a platform.
I’m still excited about the wedding
nobody cares
I miss Shane conspiracy…
😂👍
Well.. the skin in your throat is the same skin in the vagina lol
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL
My favourite thing about long Shane videos is the all the fucking around for like 10 minutes before the video topic even starts, it’s always filled with the funniest one-liners and quotable moments ❤️
Ryland eating the pizza is a mood, it’s not the world’s best pizza but like…sometimes it hits the spot, my local CEC made very congruent pies wh green my siblings were coming up and I’d eat a pie 😅
😆😆😆😆💀
I miss you shaaaaane! And thankyou for making me laughing so hard watching this! Lafff ya!
Shane! Okay so let me tell you. I'm at the part where Ryland is saying you won't marry him. So! My Fiance and I have been together for almost 15 years. We started dating at 17. He proposed when I turned 21 and finally at the age of 32 we have a wedding booked iv Vegas next month. At the same time though in those 15 years we had two beautiful girls. Own a home (in Colorado btw) I really hope one day I can meet you because I fucking love you both. Anyway marriage is just a small part of what life together is. So tell Ryland be patient because when it does happen it will be amazing.
ya’ll definitely banged.
lol, glad your back Shane
i’m so happy ur back
you look like Mrbeast
The pizza is wonky because of the pizzeria safety regulations for the employees. The cutters are not as sharp as they are normally to avoid injury. This makes the pepperoni go into the pizza when cutting as the edge is blunter than sharp
14:57 I’m fucking crying
This video just proved to me that Ryland is the best person for Shane. He's like his anchor. He supports him, but also makes sure he doesn't get exhausted by trying to bite more than he can chew. He's been with him in good times and in bad. Shane is lucky to have him.
Im so tired of not getting reccomended his videos and having to figure out he posted from tea channels (which i dont fucking watch). Makes complete sense
I miss your videos 😭😭😭😭
When Ryland started talking about the symbolism behind the flying pig and Shane looked so confused about whether that was a compliment or a drag I FULLY LOST IT for a good 10 minutes
I’m so mad that “all our guests left us” okay but who? Who are these fake friends? Tell me now? I need names…. ✍️ 📝 like that really brings out my Puertorican, brings out my Scorpio… like let’s go 🥊 Fuck ppl for real!        I agree with Ryland the wedding will be amazing with just family and TRUE friends. I can’t wait!! 🤍
No Shane it’s not a game lmao your mom believes in God God is the truth Jesus is the truth read the Bible and you’ll have all your answers trust him
Didn’t know that all I needed was to hear Shane talk about vaginas today 😌🤣
wait chris, tana's ex ?
Laughed so hard with the side comments of Shane and the pizza then after a disclaimer  this guy is hilarious
It might be because I am myself a very jealous person, but I had the feeling that whenever Shane joked about dreaming that Ryland had a V, or when he joke-flirted with Chris, or about not marrying, and dumping Ryland, Ryland did feel a bit.. upset or at least annoyed. Everyone knew they were just jokes, but, maybe it made Ryland slightly worried or uncomfortable. I was laughing and I found this video very entertaining, but felt a bit bad for Ryland. Side note: I think Colorado is the better place for S + R, they should sell or rent the LA house. I could never live in LA myself, too hot, too shallow, too fake. Just my opinion. Greetings from Germany.
Laughed so hard the whole video I’m obsessed with his vibes 🥺❤️ genuine entertainment
I sooooo fucking miss y’all. Excuse my French but you made my night. scream laughs non stop. Love yaaaaaallll. Aloha 🤙🏼❤️❤️😘😘
This is the opposite if what should be happening rn. I thought we had gotten rid of him
i love your videos tho me n my mom n lil sister always watch your videos especially the conspiracy ones
Make merch that’s not obviously your merch so your fans can wear it without being attacked 😭😅😅😅😅
Talking and making fun about sexual things feels just wrong because of his past.
That psychic could have known all of you from the media.Please check out Matt Fraser, America's Nr1 Psychic. He is on youtube.
no one is controlled by anything lol we do not own the earth, the earth owns us
this is whitemans way of thinking....study Canadain history n youll know what i mean
Barbara said “can’t relate” 😂😂😂😂 this video is actually hilarious do stand up Shane 😂😂😂😂
We miss you so much Shane, yes youve done some questionable things in your past BUT WHO HASNT. Please come back to Youtube full time, we need you more than you know xxxx
Are we forgetting all he did. This is a person who doesn’t deserve his platform
the urgent care in the same parking lot as chuck e cheese lmao
Shane 🤪🤪🤪so funny 😁 😂 😀 🤣
THIS EPISODE IS ALL WE NEEDED !!
We missed you Shane! And we are all so glad that you’re back! ❤️🎉🎉
Podcast!!  Yes please
That dream is very interesting. Tells a lot about Shane. I have this great healer/medium and she says that bisexuals are sexually confused (and so are gays btw,). I am not homophobic, my brother is gay and I have gay friends. My healer says that gay and bi people are imprinted in childhood either by absence of the father or some kind of abuse of them or the mother or the mother talking bad about men, etc. And you can have more than one boy in a family like that but only the very sensitive boys become gay or bi.  I don't care if I get haters for this and I don't care because you don't know my healer and I know it's the truth! Peace! Greetings from Switzerland. Love you Shane XX
WE MADE IT!
didn’t even notice the vid was 44 mins 😭 felt like 10
Omg all this gay talk Shane you need to Collab with watt the safe word they will help you with your inner gay kink names lol
Whoevers playing my game is a f..king sadist who likes to see me suffer.
You tube recommended your channel and new video even though you make fun of looking like Ceelo Green with a dark mask on. How do think this is ok?
You start your video with perverted content for what reason? Because your fans let you get away with it.
Re:Chuck E. Cheese Pizza…Do they cut the pizza before cooking it? That could explain the changes in size because it wouldn’t cook uniformly, and would bake the cheese on the slice edges individually as well….just thinking out loud haha
Shane- As long as it makes you happy, it's what we want!
Chuck E Cheese's has honestly been the name since  as far back as I can remember  and I was born in 1980.
if i hadn't been watching you in rylands vlogs and i didn't actually know what has been going on, i would be so utterly lost by the first bit of this video
the amount of positive comments here.... dissapointing.
why the fuk is this nonsense being promoted... dont pay to promote this garbage it's actually degenerate filth.
This really just felt like hanging out with friends. I appreciate the vibes <3
shane! we're happy you're happy. and thank you for coming back!
We love you and so happy your back ❤️❤️
But did you know that Chuck E Cheese tried to swindle everyone during the pandemic by changing their name to Pasqually's Pizza & Wings on delivery apps….
I choked on my water when he said “we made it chucky “
I loved this one need more tired of rewaching old videos we need new ones!
I love your videos no matter what you post your soul energy is the same Be safe I love you
Meow
do a documentary where u right ur wrongs to ppl in ur past. and genuinely mean it.
dying the whole time lmaooo
The amount of puns in this is fucking hilarious.
Anybody that thinks we are living in a simulation, needs Jesus in their life…🤦🏼‍♀️. Still love watching Shane tho. 😊
Why YouTube would suggest you to me only screams their algorithm is pushing absolutely everybody towards a screaming liberal…
We made it chucky🥳
I’ve literally missed this Shane ❤️❤️❤️😂
But I do want it
need more vlog style content like this
I'm DYING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I miss this...
Literally was dying throughout this😭😭😭
Bro chuck e.cheese pizza use to be so fucking good, where I live they fucked it up
You can make Chris’s nickname “ChrisTea”
IVE MISSED THE PODCAST SO MUCH!!! I CANT WAIT! SHANE IS BACK!!
Do one about your black face parties
have you read animal farm by george orwell? you know the pigs rule
18:58 - we get it </3 but also,,, <3
you’re literally the big brother i never had so glad you’re back literally grew up on u mistakes and all<3 alsooo i remember definitely hearing the recycled pizza thing as a kid i think even my parents said it lol
TIGHT PUSSY ENERGY MERCH IS EVERYTHINGGGGGGGGG
Funny I'm sure it wasn't the Republicans that tried to cancel u so hard lol  they diff ain't the reason why I'm sure u have to think of every lil joke b4 U post now
The same joke for 40+ minutes. Great.
Daily uploads and 17 ads…sign me up for daily shane!!! Thnx Chuck 🤣💕
It's nice to see you back. I missed your humor and sass. Excited to see what is in the future
SHANE I NEED YOU TO SEE THIS. I commented this on your alien conspiracy video it makes so much sense. What if the "men in black" are aliens. No features Black eyes and they could be the so called Tall white aliens that the one government guy explained. It makes sense
Legit order it non cut next time then see
this was chaotic but i loved it <3
“I see u at the meetings “ HAHAHAHA ❤️❤️❤️
Poor Chris,  no one  wants to walk in on their parents  🤣😒
Love that you're back Shane. Missed you much! Just do what feels comfortable for you right now! Can't wait to see what's up your sleeve! 🥰
Hey Shane, I just wanna say that honestly aside from Jenna marbles, you have always been my favourite YouTuber and I understand how you’re feeling and what you’re going thru. We’re not perfect, we are human. We make mistakes and ppl will talk, but I admire your strength. I hope to keep going like you someday, despite all the hate I deal with in my own life. Besos, for you and Ryland 🤗
The fact that shane really doesn’t try the pizza is hilarious
I have so missed this group and Shane try to not be so hard on urself idk since I'm not a gay man can't speak for them on this, but us grown woman love a man with alil meat on them for those cold nights *wink*. So don't worry I think ur sexy with just ur spunkiness and I'm sure some would agree. I would love to have someone like u as a friend and say screw what others think be happy cus those people don't know u from Adam so don't let their negitivites get to u because everyone has something about themselves they don't like.
Earth is this galaxy’s insane asylum. Welcome to my ward...
So happy you are back Shane! You were dearly missed! 💗🥳
I CANT BELIEVE CHUCK E CHEESE IS STILL USING RECYCLED PIZZA! THAT'S ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING! YOU CAN CLEARLY TELL THEY WEREN'T 1 PIZZA & THEY WERE PUZZLED TOGETHER! 🤢🤮
Seriously they should sue themselves for trying to harm people with their pizza. And the judge should throw this out, what a waste of the courts time. Since most everyone has eyeballs and also feels this way, not sure how they think they'll get anywhere
No matter what the nature of their relationship is, Shane needs to treat Ryland better
Am I the only one seeing an unhealthy relationship between Shane and Ryland? Seemed like Shane was being a bit of a bully
when I say I laughed for 40 minutes and it felt like 10. your videos uplift everyones spirit. we've all missed you Shane!
Umm 🅿️ most definitely is not positive AND there's no way you don't know what it means, so I think your just dodging it BUT just in case you really don't, it means p e t o 📂.
"There's a lot of things I want to do like Conspiracies…Porn Stars" Bahahaha 🤭😂🤣
Regarding your wedding.. you don't need to make it a big deal out of it (only if you want to). Have it in the grounds of your Colorado house, you love that property and you have had so much joy there already. Just have family attend and you don't need to wear a tux Shane. This is Ryland's and your wedding. This is your special day,  have it the way you want it... and take some video clips for us 😉.
Makes sense they like talking about pizza, I'm sure CP is his favorite
I love your videos Shane please don't ever stop uploading or listen to the haters!!
I love that Shane had an existential crisis for a bit after seeing the pizza was still wonky. Also the disclaimer omg legally responsible queen ✌🏻
SHANE - You know that there is a Chuck E Cheese in CO as well lol. Just in Lone Tree, CO actually.
Literally staring at a SKINNY QUEEN!!!
I don’t take my kids to our Chuck E. Cheese anymore because a woman shot someone at a birthday party there and then drove off without her kids.
honestly id love for shane to make another podcast
Im dying. Whenever tht disclaimer shows up my heart races. I can't believe you almost got sued....sucks u can't speak your mind
Was having a really rough day today but this video made my night, thank you Shane.
Soooo I think it's funny that I also never thought I'd see the days in the future 😅
"wait... in my dream, your- vagina"
so awkward
I’m LIVING for this content!
Wait, Shane has been uploading?! Why the hell did I not know this or get notified?!
BYE SHANE IS SO FUNNY HE SENDS
Chuckee cheese either sells pizza by the slice and makes up a whole pizza from different FRESH pizza's OR they precut the pizza before baking. There's no other logical way to explain shrinking to the LENGTH and how all slices look baked at different temperatures
Is anyone else laughing at the fact that they're talking about how the pizza may be recycled and there's an Urgent Care in the background? I can't stop giggling at that 😂
Lol they have so many people on TikTok that work at places and show it... I wanna see someone video them make these 😂 come on!
So good. Laughed the whole last 10 minutes straight. Thanks!
PLEASE START A PODCAST
love yaaaaa
we love you shane!!
Your giving me Alexis vibes from schitts 😂
that guys simulation theory was the worst ive ever heard
I love watching these at work man
The three of you walking around the house aimlessly, talking about literally nothing, had me laughing out loud so many times. I SO needed this! Thank you, Shane! (And Ryland and Chris!)
Just another clickbait, thanks Shane.
The nickname is Chrissss.
Okay but real question(if you should ever see this Shane), DO YOU HAVE JOGGERS LEFT IN YOUR STOCK!?! I need them all 🥺 I have 2 pairs and need them all 😂
Ahhh!! Yes🙌🏼 you can tell you’re being your most authentic self & it beautiful to see. And I missed this humor so much 🤣
Love this I couldn’t stop laughing my baby is asleep next to me Lmaoo and I’m trying to be quiet but it’s literally impossible I keep lol’ing. I can watch this 5 or 6 times in a row ❤️❤️❤️ so happy you’re back on your channel
YESSSSSSSSS what ive been needing you help my depression and always crack me up!
ku klux klan member
Little Caesars makes their dough fresh and in the store too and our pizza don't look uneven like that and its still round even if we cut not even some slices are smaller then others but its still perfectly round
“We made it Chucky!!!” 🤣
19:04 Sadly yes we made it 🥳
oh my gosh. how i’ve missed you shane!! you will always be my favorite youtuber no matter what
“Are you allergic to….. garbage???”🤣🤣🤣 HE’S BACK!!!❤️❤️❤️
Omg I laughed soo hard at this vlog. Thanks for the entertainment! 🤣😂
This is a joke. It would have been good if titled appropriately. Why the need to deceive
YA
This is everything I didn't know I needed! Love you Shane!! 🐷🖤
Shane everyone needs to know the details, do you be getting high before you vlog?!🤣
Yes we want new videos shane<3 missing the old camera man he cant be replaced
I have a crazy demonic attachment story from when I was little if you want to interview me sometime.
I don't know what I just watched, but it was funny and entertaining. 🤣
tf
“Putting your mouth or fingers in it seems straight” umm, sir, what about us women who like women, hmm? We straight now?
wow, this is fucking sad. I loved watching your videos until the sexist and disgusting comments came into play. IK you think it is a joke, but others take it seriously (like those who have been sexuallly assaulted (PTSD and shit) (ME!) This can be taken the wrong way shane...I would be careful.... This type of stuff is not necessary, I am not trying to be against you, but you should be for this offensive shit, Think before you say things man. I have always loved your videos, and this one offended me and showed me some true colors. I am not saying you are a bad person, I am just saying this stuff shouldn't be said?  Just out of respect of others.
This video was hilarious, I was laughing the whole fucking time! 🅿️ 🤣
Omg what if the employees are just taking slivers for themself lol
Interestingly I was just doing research on this about two weeks ago on glitch simulation due to unexplained video footage I found on YouTube apparently it’s related to the matrix, I never watch the matrix movie but it’s pretty wild idea.
WOW... some people really are "UNCANCELLABLE" smh.
ugh i love shane. this is the humor i missed 10:01
Shane you can have a tacobell wedding! It's a thing!
I have missed shane and ryland so much CANT WAIT FOR MORE
Wait what…He’s back finally
I love it Shane thank you! I had a rough day and really needed this. ❤️🥺
I will always 100% believe that chucky cheese will have old half eaten pizza because of the conspiracy videos lol
Shane, Shane, Shane. I love you. Thanks for all the giggles.
JAJAJAJAJA the finger thing
I miss the haunted vids!
I can name like five other things u SHOULD be sued for
Hope ur conspiracy videos arnt filled with the usually antisemitism
The laughing is so forced…
I swear everyone in the comments is high or being paid off this video sucked
Shane you better marry Ryland! He is out here risking his life eating that pizza so you don’t get sued! 🤣
I worked at Chucky e cheese in high school the pizza wasn't the bad part it was the salad bar 😭 little kids go up there putting there hands in it, it gets dropped on the ground and thrown back in. The smell of the salad bar was always so nasty. We'd have to leave the salad out from open 8am-11pm close that's all day just sitting out and being touched and dropped and put back in it was disgusting!!
Missed you!! 💜👏🏽🤗
In Raylans defense Shane did snort in the beginning of the video 🤣❤🐖 & other times throughout 🤔😆
I love you sm Shane I’ve been watching you for like 10 years 🤍
KEEPIN IT P 😂😂😂
He should’ve known he was gonna get sued😂
Ryland is so annoying. A thumbs down cuz the sound of rylands voice
Also more conspiracy vids plz!!
Shane, you make my heart happy.
Shane: Chucke don’t come for me   My brain: yeah don’t get murd- oh not the doll the restaurant  Also fun fact as a rat owner I can say that they really like low sugar applesauce (in small amounts), blueberries and mealworms  Don’t know if anyone cares but… yeah
nothing happened in this video. should have been less than 10 minutes long.
Does chuckie cheese take slices from a buffet to make whole pizzas maybe? So they don't have to make new ones. Seems possible.
Ahh I loved the video 💕
This video was everywhere, halfway still waiting for lawsuit talk
I honestly hate “cancel culture” and I’m so beyond hype that Shane is making videos again
No one gonna talk about the weird shit he said on the pod cast about naked baby’s and looking them up ?
Shame on you.
I’ve supported you to soooooo long and I’ve been waiting for your return. I’ve never stopped supporting you. We all do stupid stuff sometimes. Say stupid stuff. I absolutely love you and I’m proud of you! You have grown so much. You are an amazing person and never let ANYONE tell you different!!!!
Shane is sweet! Keep doing you Shane💞 I miss you
I say go for it!!! I love you Shane!!!!
I think this is the hardest I've genuinely laughed in so fucking long omg
Please do a podcast Shane!
Really hott that Shane is bisexual.... But..on the other hand.. I am totally going to miss you guys in the old house!!!!!!
This made me want pizza so bad
pushing 🅿️
Is the Chuck w cheese conspiracy still in videos? Cannot find it
Ryland seems high as hell in this video! Lol I get what he's trying to say though😂
Somebody has been working on his fitness. Shane is looking healthy.
I missed your videos so much!
lmaoo this man is either deleting comments like it’s his full time job or has some serious comment filters on  there ain’t a way in hell that this bitch’s comments are *this* positive 🤦 i can’t think of a singular person i’ve seen on the internet who genuinely likes him anymore
Missed you 😭 so happy you are thriving don't rush, stay hydrated
I adore him I love that he is back again! 💜✨🙌🏽
Shane Dawson: Mental health? Also Shane: No. Everyone else: totally same.
Never stop this is your platform.  And you haven't even launched yet.  The countdown is just starting your life is about to change not only for you but this who look to your content for help through their weeks and days.
I fucking hated you Shane.. like when all the  major shit went down..but tbh I missed you, been watching you for like 10yrs <3
Being an Independent is an amazing thing! Just saying! Welcome back!
love this Shane!!!!
I love you Shane but those voices are demons
Omg i just had a Crumble cookie today!! First time and OMG they were huge and delicious!!🤪
Hilarious who da hell gets banned from Chucky cheese. 🤣🤣🤣
Honestly I missed this so much! Thank you, Shane.
Omg if you do podcast  record it and post it here i looooove watching you 🥰
chris cant film worth shit
Pure “clickbait” 😩 but whatever!🤪
Oh how I've missed you Shane
Ur 100% getting sued
This isn’t content I’m interested in watching but I’m so glad cancel culture hasn’t ruined you and you’ve returned to getting on with your life. Just wanted to say that. Love you Shane💝
I've missed this chaotic energy
The simulation is capitalism, it's not that hard. Humans created this system, we know understand it's destroying our lives and the planet, and now we can shift the focus from consumption to actually valuing human life.
Use this as a dislike button lmao. I’m sure this comment will get deleted.
Shane, what we want is you on Youtube! Doesn't matter what you post, as long as you love it, we do too.
Happy you’re back, doing what you love.
Pizza is like sex. Even when it’s bad it’s still kinda good. 😂😂😂
Ahhhh love
U need to make tight pussy energy merch
Can we take a moment to appreciate Shane’s weight loss. It’s good to see him work on himself and that he’s just all around thriving.
So mine just tells me to eat and sleep all day.
I missed you 💓💓😮‍💨
Keep on shining Shane!!!
I missed u. :(
1:36-1:43 meee  but born and raised in Texas Lmfaoo
I’m just wanting for the day I get to meet this man anywhere :,)
This was nice but I don’t want only this random Documentary funny talks. Over the years it’s getting kinda boring. I want some old video ideas back or maybe something new. So please do more entertaining stuff what get me reminding, why I subscribed 11 years ago.
Laughed so hard with the side comments of Shane and the pizza then after a disclaimer 🤣🤣🤣 this guy is hilarious
I'm going to debunk the chicken cheese; I have never worked there but I've worked in Delis and large chains. What likely happens is that they either get it frozen (which would make the most sense) or they get them premade and they are fresh (which I doubt bc dough with oxidize.) But so they probably thaw out the pizza in a fridge or whatever and when someone orders they throw that together. Meaning of someone orders slices they will only cook those slices.. leaving them with some what uneven full pizzas. Bc why would they cook a full one of they have a full one in slices (or sections)
Ryland eating pizza is the cutest thing I’ve seen 😳🤣
Just like the old times! I missed you Shane! It's so good to have you back! 🥰
Yayyyyyy ur back ❤
Thank you Shane. I’ve been in a rough patch for a while now and this really cheered me up. People change and grow and there’s always something someone regrets or wish they did differently. I’m proud of you for trying and I’m sorry you have to see the amount of hate comments you get. Remember the important people in your life and everyone out here that you can make a positive impact on.
Pov: you’re watching Shane’s intrusive thoughts
Yes we made it🥺😂 soo happy for you❤️
I love you Shane!
So glad you are back!!!
do a catch up video with Molly Burke!  !   blind vs sighted worries and reactions etc.  how to be friends within the bind community xxxx deffo talk to each other
TPE
Loved every minute. You guys just hanging out and talking is so fun. ^_^
Tell me why I feel like I’m actually hanging out with you guys while watching this
This video is everything. I laughed so hard. Thank you 😊 so in love with the bling pig backpack ❤️
“Wow last time we saw him he was a bitch, now he’s a man” literally in a ford 🤦‍♀️
Chuck E. Cheese is charging 80 dollars for three pizzas????? I’m telling everyone they recycle their pizzas
We love a good snort. You js that damn happy you gotta sometimes 💀
I don't know what I was expecting when Shane came back but it wasn't him talking about Ryland with a vagina lmao
Truly needed this ! Thank you for making me feel better . I’ve been waiting. Truly appreciate you Shane.
I feel like they might cut the pizza before they cook it. Lolzzz I feel like there’s no wayyyy
im so excited for your podcast! i believe i listened to every episode of your old podcast as u were making them and they were my favorite <3
I was fully expecting the comment section to be filled with negative things. This is a pleasant surprise to see all of this positivity  ^^
Shane... chuckee cheese is... not chuckee cheeses ahaha
❤️ Shane!! I'm so happy to see you back making videos! About time! I've been waiting! Lol love you!!!
Im so honestly happy Shane is back! The internet can be so terrifying and people shouldn't have the power of pushing this good of a creator off yt for something they did ages ago! Shane has and will always be an icon and his videos are amazing and hilarious.
It would be so cool if he interviewed Mia Khalifia. I feel they have a lot they could relate on and both have inspiring stories
The part you guys are talking about IT had me laughing so much I almost choked on my food xD
Ok I absolutely cannot wait for the new conspiracy video
I'm saving up to be able to buy some of your merchandise can't wait  till I can lol lol
I love watching u everyday after work I wish I had a friend like u here in Kingsport TN cause I would be one lucky person if I did cause I think u are an awesome  person so hold u head up always be proud of who u are an who u touch to motivate  people thanks so much u rockkkkkk
I'm sorry but.... maybe you should get a camera person that isn't so annoying
Ok, the preview to the conspiracy video?  My "player master" or whatever needs to get their act together.   They said.
0:39 you all completely lost the plot.
Come on now Shane... enough of spirit guides and all that, give your worry, your pain and your hurt to Jesus, to God. Come back to your roots. Your humor is needed for others.
Did ryland say he spent $80 for three pizzas?! 😱
Stop shane joking about his cancellation is top tier humor 😂 god I have missed these so much
Loveeee this!!! I miss the only funny vlogs! You should definitely do the old food videos and more conspiracy theories!!!
“Before you know, you don’t know.”- Ryland Adams 2022
If anyone is curious and want a more depth reason why chuck e cheese pizza is the way it is, look up matpat he did a whole video on it
STOP IT IM LMAO THE FUCKIN REPUBLICAN JOKE AHAHAHAGA
I thought P means pissed 🤔
Eew. 🤢
I just got my wisdom teeth out and I’ve been soooooo bored. I need this lol
I’ve made pizza from scratch for years in a hot foods department at a grocery store, and it doesn’t matter if you cut uneven slices, that never made the slices uneven in length, only uneven in width. So I really don’t understand the logic of chuck-e-cheese
We haven’t gotten past the guest list because all of the guest left us 😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭
Try that cheese pizza with a side of their ranch. YUM
Yess!!! Just what i needed
had the worst day, and watching this video made me smile for the first time today <3 love you!!
I used to work there and never saw them use old slices. They didn't care how much pizza they wasted 😛 we would all make pizzas for ourselves on our lunch breaks. The only thing I think could happen is they make several pizzas in the back and people want combination pizzas. In that case they could have possibly combined freshly cooked pizzas to make a combination pizza. The oven can fit multiple pizzas at once.
Shane actually looks like he lost some weight. You look great Shane.
"Before you know, you don't know." 😅🤣
Much love from a republican ♡
1 minute in and all I have to say is, iv allways fucking said it, psychosis is your friendly friend, don't fear it work with it
idc i missed shane SO MUCH
glad you're making videos, this was funny :)
narcisist
I can't remember if you ordered an uncut pizza in the videos before....but if not you should absolutely do so...😀😃😁I love seeing you back and happy again
Hey man, don't watch your videos but glad an OG is back on YouTube. Good luck :)
I LOVE THE KILL BILL SHIRT
I feel so sorry for ryland with Shane’s jokes about their wedding, engagement, the dream and having sex with others in front of him. You can see how sad ryland was when talking about how they haven’t married yet.
Hope Shane's haters are shaking in their boots.
my only thought is all the pies come out fresh, but maybe they throw them all on the same area and cut them all at once and just piece all the fresh pieces back together or something
The whole P convo is exactly why AAVE needs to be left alone...
i love that you guys are sober and im drunk rn, and yet all of u sound like youre drunk
Great video Shane. I'm going to do a response video to this.
QUEEEEEEEEEEN
As someone who hand shaped pizzas hundreds of times for olive garden this still ain’t adding up
So nice to see you back Shane :) You look really healthy and happy!!
People really do a 360 💀
Shane, you’re not that big. You’re tall and broad, but you’re not some obese cow. You’re just a truck dude. Why doe you think trucks are that size?  Because people are.
Luv shaneee
ryland is so cute! being so supportive of shane and this video is so chaotic, it’s what i needed and missed 🥰
poor ryland
Shane please do the podcast
I love this video so much!
good job shane don’t talk about sexy babies this time
I don't care if the allegations are true, your conspiracy content is amazing
How does one have that much money but no successful skin care routine. I’m saddened 💔
You remind me so much of Kathy Griffin in this.
i feel like you guys should be looking at the crust underneath too! if they were from different pizzas i feel like they would have different shades on the bottom
Honestly missed you so much 🥰
This feels like home 🥺🥰
boy not you trying to edge urself back
whose filtering these comments
Shane please watch Scream The True Story you will love it!!
IDK, if it's just an uneven cut or uneven crust, it should still fit together. It will not make one bigger than the other. I could be wrong but...😏
is he living in colorado now or something?? i live in colorado springs 🥸
I miss your old food videos as well.
...watching Shane slowly rethink his relationship with Ryland🤣🤣🤣I adore you two.
Nah the pizza is recycled but the heat kills germs I’d hope and realistically they can fair up the prices for feeding me what someone wasn’t able to dig out the trash 🗑
Love you Shane
💙
This video is so far the best. It is so entertaining and got me laughing. Keep it up Shane, Ryan, and Christmas xx
YAS daily uploads PLEASE!!!!
I'm only 5 minutes in and lauged more than the entire week. I fucking love Shane, always will.
A lot of effort put into a simulation theory. But will you try to understand what Jesus died for our sins means?
Shane** fucking auto correct🤦🏼‍♀️
I loved it! So glad your back Shame
I needed this goofy/hilarious content today! ❤
buy…. MY MERCH 😜🤪.. 🤣🤣🤣
everytime shane says "backstory" he doesn't get back to the point for another 6 topics lmao. i love it
Okay hear me out , Shane have a crumbles cookie table at your wedding , and maybe even a cake made out of crumbles cookies … maybe that would get you excited about wedding planning Again
Shane, I'm just wondering what it would be like to be in your head because it seems like your thoughts almost overlap. They trip over themselves trying to get out. Also, you're awesome!!
I rarely ever comment on videos…. But your videos are hilarious. Please keep them coming.
Please continue to make more videos. Some of us have been watching you since we were kids! Miss ya Shane
Wow he’s the OG of YouTube. Those =3 day’s LoL when soldier knows best was the king of tech reviews,wow crazy memories
🅿️
How did I get a youtube notification for this when I'm not subscribed???
You shouldn’t care what you say. Everyone gets offended about anything. Do your thing and be great.
I so needed this. Loved watching this!! So enjoyed this and loved laughing with y'all.♥️ Can't wait to see more and see some podcasts! ✌🏼
Colorado do be changing people tho lol
You scream Bisexual!!
omggggg I loveee, couldn’t stop laughing 😭😂😂
Literally my reaction when I learned what 🅿️ meant ☠️
hes bi-the ocean
The Republican joke made me choke on my hot pocket 😂😂
I love how in the background of when they’re talking about the pizza slices. There’s an Urgent Care spot.
I MISS FOOD VIDEOS TOO
80$ for 3 pizzas!???
I MISSED YOU!!!!
Loved this so much!  ❤ you are amazing!
Do you make Chris wear a mask ?
33:20 no you’re not “like that friend” you ARE that abusive toxic friend.
Tf i will buy all his stuff 🥲🥲🥲💯💯💯
It was timeeeeee
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED!!  I LAUGHED SO HARD!!
shane is the only youtuber that makes me cry from laughing ilysm
Shane you always give me a good escape from my trauma. Very thankful you decided to post again.
I missed these while I seshed😍🥰
I love you both so much and can’t wait for more uploads 🥰🥰🥰
more like what i need!! i was ‘honking’ the entire time🤣 i love it🤩💖
Chuck E cheese pizza is fucked up and I refuse to eat trash pizza
I could not stop laughing during this video.. Shane you are truly a comedian/entertainer, and I enjoy watching you do what you love  because we love you♥️
Omg the pizza cutting comment had me in stitches! 😂🍕 The inserts of the pizza pictures too was the cherry on the top 😂
Shane, we LOVE to see you happy again 💙 not that you of course need us to say so, what you feel and receive from yourself and loved ones is enough, I am so happy for you.
Chuck E. Cheese makes their pizzas fresh, and it actually looks cut weird because of the device used to cut it. It's  huge and you have to move it in different angels to get it cut. It's not hard to understand that. They are a good franchise and one of the coolest places I've worked for
The first 15 minutes of this video is just awkward and uncomfy
Idc what anyone says but Shane Dawson will always be funny
All we want is more Shane. Make videos about whatever you want to.
Yes yes yes do a podcast!!!!!!!
19:00 ... yes.. I get it.
Yilan County Council in Taiwan passed a cross-party motion on December 24 to support the Universal Declaration on Combating and Preventing Forced Organ Harvesting (UDCPFOH). The motion condemns the organ harvesting by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and urges the Taiwan government to implement laws to help end the atrocity.    Chang Chiu-ming, a member of Yilan County Council, said a motion was passed on December 24 against organ harvesting.   When the 76th United Nations General Assembly took place in New York in September 2021, five nongovernmental organizations from the US, Europe, and Asia issued UDCPFOH on September 26, the last day of the World Summit on Combating and Preventing Forced Organ Harvesting.   UDCPFOH has been supported by parliament members, government officials, and leaders from many countries. They include Changrok Soh, member of UN Human Rights Council, and Thierry Valle, director of European Federation for Freedom of Belief. It was also endorsed by Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at New York University and the founding director of the Medical Ethics Division.   The Taiwan Falun Gong Human Rights Working Group has since contacted the central government as well as county-level governments in Taiwan, urging them to support this initiative. The Group believes that by raising awareness to the general public and taking further actions, leaders from around the world can stop the CCP’s organ harvesting through joint efforts.   During an ad hoc session held by Yilan County Council on December 24, the motion was initiated by three council members including Zhang Chiu-ming, Chen Han-chung, and Tsai Chin-hui. To fulfill its human rights commitment, the motion aims to support the UDCPFOH, condemn the organ harvesting atrocity by the CCP, and institute related criminal legislation. For specific implementation of this resolution, the council requests the county government to contact relevant agencies of the Taiwan Executive Yuan. With 25 cosponsors, including Wu Hong-mo and Yang Tree, this motion was passed in the council.   Chang said he was happy to see Yilan Council supporting the upright with this motion. Yang pointed out the CCP’s brutality of organ harvesting is anti-humanity and it is a disgrace to mankind. He hopes such efforts will stop the atrocity and promote kindness as well as traditional values in society.   All articles, graphics, and content published on Minghui.org are copyrighted.

This vid, 🅿️😆
Is shane still Friends with Jeffrey Star? I lost track - thank you for the Info…  Stay PPP:)
I will always love and support you!
The chuck e cheese where I live. Their pizza is actually pretty good.
I still love Shane so much and I'm so excited for the conspiracy videos
Welcome back we have missed u
I haven’t laughed this hard since the last Shane video and it’s been too long. Thank you Shane. My daughter is 2 weeks old and I will force her to understand our stupid sense of humor…
I needed this so much ! I missed these kinda videos and laughed the whole damn time. Love you Shane Ryland & Chris !!
This is very 🅿️ hahaha🤍🤍🤍
Damn this guy is the embodiment of "internet always forget"
Me currently wearing pink pig hoodie
I love that you want adventures! Just  ordered the baby blue tumbler can’t wait to get it! Glad your back ♥️
ask for a chucky cheese uncut pizza
Because of the cutter simple
Shane’s back and I’m here for it 💜💜💜
Keep more coming! Excited to see more conspiracies 🙌🏻
Why do I only watch Shane when I’m taking a shit 🥲😂😂
What happened to Jessie Buttafuoco? Did they fall out after the podcast? I loved their dynamic.
Shane, you are incredible and unique. I relate with all of your fases, it's so crazy. I'm happy to see you back on business. Lots of love, Pig King <3
this actually made my week im so happy
Wow I think this is what my mental health needed. Happy Shane’s back 🥳
I missed you so funcking much! You make my life happier! Hope to see more crazy videos, food videos, conspiracy videos but specially I wish to see more Shane videos. With your soul, heart and everything you are and have to show. Love you, guys. Hope to see this marriage SOON. hehe <3
Shaaaannneee 🌈🌈🌈💜
“2022, I ain’t gonna be there”! The girls that get it, get it. The girls that don’t, don’t!
no matter how often shane gets cancelled, i'm always going to come wandering back to the new videos 😂
This video was so fucking funny, I always know Ima die of laughter when I see you upload <3
Whatever happened in your break was good for you. I love the better attitude. Also all the jabs. 😂
Maybe the pizza maker is just hungry and they take lil slices out of every pizza 🤷🏼‍♀️
Yeah I missed you shane
omgg y'all need to go to Jeffree's ranch and film lol
You can order out from Chuck E Cheese?
Shane thank you for finally posting and stop doubting you content this is the video everyone wanted and didn’t know they needed it!!
this made me order 2 large pizzas from Chuck e Cheese
I'm sorry did he say 80 for 3 pizzas?
You guys need to get married you can tell Ryland really wants to spend the rest of his life with you. He seems to actually care about wanting to get married.
hello
FUCK! I FUCKING LOVE YOU! ❤  ITS BEEN A MINUTE! I MEAN IVE BEEN WATCHING IT SEEMS SINCE YOUTUBE STARTED! MISS YOU!
Avoiding marriage and gaslighting about the pig thing and playing on rylands insecurities are a red flag for me
Maybe the pizza is jacked up bc all of the slices are sliced? So that way little kids can grab the pizza without the dough sticking to the pan or the cheese falling off the whole slice 🤷🏽‍♀️ bc they seem like they are a bit over done, but not in a nasty way. It made me want to order a Chuckie E. Cheese pizza, but I live in Flint, MI and don’t want to get shot at.
LOL ok Shane is the definition of ADHD 😂 he thinks exactly like me it’s funny to see what it looks like from the outside since that’s literally me on a daily basis 🤣
cringe
I laughed so hard
I neeeed to know the name of that sectional lol pretty pretty please!
I cannot wait for your podcasts!!!! I freaking miss you so much dude ❤️
Shane I would for sure listen to your podcast! I only recently got into podcasts and they're more popular now than ever. I was actually thinking recently I wish you still did your podcast.
shane pls do a astroWorld conspiracy video abt how that shit was planed
Poor Ryland. Even tho we know Shane loves the hell out of him, Shane was really making him feel some type of way with the comments he kept making and u can tell Ryland felt some kind of way but was keeping it in. Also, if u don’t want a big wedding u could always have something more intimate with just the families and a few friends? Maybe even in your Colorado backyard 🤷🏻‍♀️
Yes the chuck e follow up!
Shane you need to stay cancelled. This changes nothing... I can't believe how many people believe your bs....
Haven’t watched you since I was like 16 and you’re still the same I freaking love it😂
in that case the person who is controlling us could be under a simulation too and the person controlling the person who’s controlling us would be under control too, this is a paradoxical ideology.
I never realized how much I missed Shanes videos until now. I have been deprived!!
Low key might try to get a job at my local Chuck E. Cheese so I can find out the truth for us all😂😂
It means pushin 🅿️
Shane I have not laughed this much from a video, I’m glad you are back, made my whole day 💖
Oh no
You know id literally pay to be at their wedding. That's a lie....I wouldn't....cause Im a broke bitch but still lmaoo so happy you're back Shane 🥰
So happy to see you back on YouTube!! I’ve missed your videos!!!
I've literally been watching Ryland's videos just to see Shane!!! I've missed his videos so much!!!! Welcome to Colorado, and really hope you keep making videos!! 😭❤️❤️❤️
What happened to Kate Yup?
Not to be dramatic but watching Shanes videos I feel like some missing part of my life is back
ILY KING
Poor Ryland omg lol!! 🤦🏼‍♀️
What if chuck e cheese is now just capitalizing off the conspiracy and cuts newly made pizzas up and then re-creates a full pizza out of different made pizzas. So people will buy their pizza Just to see if it’s fucked up 🤔
Hahaha omg this was gold🙌🏻 just made my day can’t wait to see more content from you Shane!❤️
Was there not an investigation/ inspection on chuckEcheese to see how they prepared the pizza. I mean in that they’d be able to see how the pizza gets like that… and if it doesn’t look like that. If they couldn’t replicate that look.. Then that would be suspicious???
Shane! It has been a very tough 6-12 months for me (following a tough enough 26 years of life) and this video had my fiancé and I laughing out LOUD. He was a huge fan of your earlier work on YT and I discovered you when you left your previous relationship. I was so touched by your relationship with your ex, the love that went into that breakup video, and I’ve been a huge fan of all your work since. Thank you for coming back. Thank you for stepping out of your comfort zone of seclusion and putting yourself out there for our entertainment. Keep it 🅿️ man.
"You can all judge me if you want but I do not care I have never ever been happier."
no way shane has lost that much subscribers
He’s back! His personality is coming back how he used to be!!! I love him I miss him.. so proud of you Shane, the haters will hate like they always do but you stay true to you, and it shines ☀️
Okay but a cancelled anonymous podcast would be so cool.. and you could get like Jenna Marbles. Y’all would be so funny😩
I could watch your videos all day!! I think doing podcasts again would be great! Just make sure your mental health is a priority. 💕
I missed u fr
Hear me out,  you start a podcast called "cancelled" and interview people in the latest drama.
Shane sell the merch ppl will buy I promise.
OMG! Ryland looks super adorable in the Santas Lil Helper dress!!!  Please marry him Shane, PLEASE just do a backyard ceremony with family. It makes it extra special that way.
yay shane!
Being 86’d from “The Cheese” is the P for me!!!
I looooooooooove you shane please dont stop making videos
If you’re watching this video you get it:     If that’s not the truth!!!!!! We made it!!!!! *sigh*
*"It's the lawsuit for me"* I was literally on the floor!! Glad ur back Shane and glad you ddin't ket the lessers get to you❤
Ask for it uncut  😏
🅿️
So happy you’re back shane :))
Just imagine Shane Dawson does a tell all series with Britney Spears. So iconic that would be everything
All I’m saying is that I miss the spooky boys….and also I’m so glad you’re back! All I want is what we used to have!! 🖤🖤
no wait....im in my 30's, i need translations. what does the P mean for reals???
I’m at work, just trying to casually watch this in the back ground. I AM SEVEN MINUTES IN AND I AM IN TEARS AND CANT EVEN WORK
Love this love ❤️ 💕
11:43 “señor pooh” 😭☠️
SHANE!! So happy you are back!! Missed you and you are a blessing in this space !
It’s so cute seeing Ryland jealous. So glad you’re back Shane. You’ve helped me so much with my Mental Health issues and Body issues. Thank you for always being there for me even though you’ll never know me probably. Thank you for being you. I’m so happy for you. I feel the suicidal thing, more than you know. I keep notes too lol. But just thank you. Take care 💙
I'm proud of Shane for improving. Good choice of mine for giving him a second chance people hate me for it and people have left me friends, family, ect. But hey, I'm at the point where I don't actually care.
Laughed so hard with the side comments of Shane and the pizza then after a disclaimer 🤣🤣🤣 this guy is hilarious
“Preach brother!” took me out 😭😭
i’m sorry, but get a new camera man.
OMG I really needed this video!! I haven't laughed so much in YEARS!!! Thank you and glad your back!!!
7:50 “MARVEL” LMFAOOO as a huge marvel fan, that talk made me happy.
Please go to jail so the world and youtube can become better places .
Saying this for everyone, me included: We love you Shane and so glad you're back!!💙
I currently have Covid. Watching this..... was this a fever dream? 🤣
F this sensitive a** society. Glad ur back
I can always expect my cheeks to hurt when watching these guys, thank you for the laughs.
I cannot breath I’m laughing so hard!!! Hahahahahahah 😂😂😂
MISSED U
CONSPIRACY👏VIDEO👏PLEASE👏
Not so bad for being “canceled” 🤣
Flip the pizza and have it so you can see the crust
Listen to Throat Goat by Kim petras
😳3:35😳
Welcome back 😊
Rylands outfit ICONIC
Ok… but why didn’t YouTube notify me about Shane uploading?!?!
Hard to watch.
So I showed this to my boyfriend who works at another major chain pizza place as a manager. And he said there’s no way in hell the cutter can do that to the pizzas. Even on the weakest of people. So Shane thank you for making Chuck E. Cheese stop disgusting behavior. You’re awesome
Ryland, $80 for that pizza?! 🙀
Ryland looking like a whole ass pizza man 😂😂
I have missed your sense of humor to things, which what I love about you. 🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍💕💕💕💕
what is the???)
I plan to haunt shit when I die just so I can finally meet my soul sister Shane
Conspiracy videos!!!!!!!!!!!!’!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Chuck E Cheese filed for bankruptcy.  You got “canceled” for years of gross behavior and learned nothing.
Was literally laughing the whole time. Love you and love that youre back. ❤
te amo
Idc what kind of video you put up, although we love a good conspiracy 🔥I’m just so glad you back 🥺💕
If you “hate getting married” his words, you shouldn’t have married or gotten engaged to Ryan. He is waiting for a wedding which honestly is sad, he wants to be married he wants to be husbands. If you don’t want that, don’t keep him waiting. Marriage is a big deal to some people.
shane ilysm
Shane, you had me literally laughing out loud in the middle of the office. I love you! I'm so glad you're filming again!
so many gays
yes i get it, but we made it!!
Next time ask for it not cut
stooooop i cant stop laughing. i needed this
Papa 🅿️ means like playa, i think lmfao
Shane, you had me literally laughing out loud in the middle of the office. I love you! I'm so glad you're filming again!
This is the funniest best content I have watched all week thank u Shane glad you’re back😂😂💕💕💙
Love the urgent care directly across from Chuck E.
i’m so happy you’re back i could cry 😭
This is exactly what i needed to start my day off good😃 so glad you are back. Keep doing what you are doing💖
TPEEEE
Before ya know , ya dont know
😂😂😂 he’s kinda funny
I think what happens is that they make a whole pizza if someone orders a 1/2 , they save the other 1/2 until someone orders the other 1/2 that way they cut down cost and there is no waste
I know the world isn't always kind Shane, yes you have made misbut they are the same damn near ALL of us have made! You are just in the spotlight. Please dont let the world keep you away from all of us who love you!
I missed this sm
Wait... 3 large pizzas was $80?!  Also I love the chaotic energy through this whole video. I usually don't re-watch videos but this one I have several times just to hear the interaction between you three. <3
I’ve missed Shane so much.
We LOVE YOU SHANE!
Because they’re special😊.       😭😭😭😭😭😭
its not 🅿 to not know what 🅿 is shane.
I was having an awful day I loved this glad you are back
Could not stop laughing 😆 love youuuu!!!!
I feel like people aren't grasping the situation that he was involved in properly. He fucked up, and it wasn't a minor offense. I feel like we need an explanation and apology before words of praise are given. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Who?
Shane is the top.
I loved Ryland’s podcast episode that you were on so much that I wanted you to be permanent but your own podcast is even better!! Can’t wait!
Finally. Now we need Jenna and all is well
Shane, you should really watch the recent Call Her Daddy interviews (Jamie Lynn!!) this doesn’t have anything to do with your podcast idea I just think you’ll like that interview!!
Shane, watching your videos always feels like hanging out with an old friend. Except I can just watch the video and I don't have to get a bra on. Lol
💕❤️💕❤️💕❤️💕
So wholesome 😭🤍
I missed you 🥺🖤
if it is the blade, I’d like to see the crusts of the pizzas lined up to see if it really is just that the slices have moved about
so glad you're back Shane !!!!
I love this man
I’m happy you’re back 😊
My boyfriend works at Chuck E. Cheese and the reason why the pizzas are all so fucked up is bc there are 16 and 17 year olds working in the kitchen and they don’t show them how to cut it right 🙄
The world needs your humor in it. Thank you for this.
The rest of the video is fine but THE BEGINNING. LIKE DAMN STFU
So glad you are back! We need new content I think we are tired of watching the older vids just to pass time till a new one comes out <3
Go to prison and stay there. Get some therapy too.
I love yall so much 3rd time watching this
Witch here... manifestation of the holy feminine symbols like vessel, wombs, and just fem energy is meaning you viewing mother. knowing you and ry are moving forword with planing for a family. Your subconscious is already placing ryland into the role of mother. This is just what I remember  for dream interaptions Ive done before. Hope it makes you feel ready and better.
18:50 yup normal i’m 18 next months and i never thought i’d get there (not in a ‘i’m gonna kms’ way but in a ‘wow im getting old who woulda thought’ way)
mmm no immediately no
So  the first minute shows how wrong you are huh? 🤣🤣
1% regular video  99% v@g!n@s
Tight badussy energy
Hey Shane do you may or may not see this but I just recently heard about the conspiracy of the Denver airport I believe you should really do a video about this it would be soooo interesting and you guys live in Colorado so yeah plz do because I’m really invested in what people think may be going on under the tunnels.
Y’all are still fun
I don't get how ppl could get pizza and leave some without eating it all or taking it home lol. Also I feel like everyone has some stretch marks they just might not know they do lol.
We made it 💕🌞
shane aint pushing 🅿️
I’m pushing 🅿️
the conspiracy about Chucky cheese pizza is absolutely NOT FICTION. it is 100% real.  Shane was not the only person who did a video on it and I have seen it myself in person.  There is no way that a pizza comes out of the oven like that.  come on
Chuck E Cheese is a joke. The disclaimer was at the beginning of the video. There’s no lawsuit to be had.
I feel like they don’t know how to cut pizza.
your editing is everything fucking literally EVERYTHING
and the Legacy Continues!
I’m just waiting for someone to make a compilation of Shane trying to not get sued by Chuck E. Cheese
no.
Ryland with the pig 😭😭😂
This was everything, I missed this Shane! Thank you for just being you and posting again ❤️❤️
wow deleting comments. not surprised
🅿️ means valid. If u ain’t 🅿️ u ain’t valid
Shane you are amazing i love Your YouTube channel
Love to see your face again! Can’t wait for more content Shane!
Hi I love you 💕
Eugenia Cooney is dying
Shane needs an old animatronic on his house.. ticked me off when they got rid of the robotics like come on!!! Lol 😆 Just find an abandoned one and take it home.. could be a whole thing.
I love Shane.    Love Ryland love Morgan love the whole family.       Shane u need to marry Ryland.  I felt sadness as u played around n I can tell he's just waiting.  I thought faggot was a insensitive word. I would never call my spouse that .
love your videos, i've missed them! we need more
when i was 6 i walked in on my mom and stepdad and now im a lesbian-
Omg I laughed so hard. I really have missed you!  It really shows this is something you love to do. And no one should have stopped you from being creative and filming. I’m so happy your back!!!!! Love youuuuu!! And get married!!!
My best friend and I freaking love you and Ryland and whenever you post anything we immediately tell the other about it! It warms our hearts seeing you post again and being happy and #thriving. (Also being her hype girl) she has her own channel (abigail’s cup of tea) and she’s an adorable book loving sunshine human and she’d die of happiness if you checked out any of her videos. Can’t wait to see more content from you!!!
8:29-8:30. Can i just 🥺🥺 I'm so happy to see you in a wonderful place
Literally laughed the whole video. SO glad you're back!
I mean man speaking facts
How are u even still in here 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Ryland has the same personality as my aunt and I luv it!💗
I can’t with this comment section - like everyone’s forgetting everything he’s done
I've missed you so much Shane! 🥰
Poor Ryland, man. Lol.
I’m ☠️☠️
Who is Shane Dawson 🤔
Eh I guess he's a cub/otter? A little older and he'll be a bear. I prefer husky guys myself
Love you shane!!! Any video you are in is what i want lol
i missed you wow
This made me so happy😊
I’ve never laughed so hard in my life I loved every second of this video 😂
This was fun! PLEASE POST MORE OFTEN
Shane literally grasping for straws with chuck e cheese has me cackling in my boyfriends car at 5 in the morning 😭😂
We’re BAAAAAACK BAAABYYYY!!! 🤩🤩🥳
good to see you all. i was worried something bad had happen.
Shane! We NEED that merch TPE!!! Haha that is hilarious! 🤣
not yall in the comments supporting a literal pe2do 😟
FYI, UFO'S are NOT a conspiracy anymore 😀. Watch 60 minutes Australia's latest video 😜.
This is so awkward and uncomfy
Imagine That. People are working shitty jobs to pay for rent and bills. And then anything left to treat yourself , maybe a pizza ?? Everything is a fucking scam in America. Fake Biz.
Ugh, Ryan is annoying.  He needs to chill about the wedding. Also, I'm noticing that he hates when he's not the center of attention.... Honestly, I'm happy to see Shane happy and wanting to film something
I laughed out loud on so many parts. Shane is a legend.
Shane Dawson and Roland are my favorite youtubers I don't care what anyone says to me love them both so much
I’ve been rocking with Shane since 2012. He’s been hilarious since and still is now. I’m here for whatever. Also Tight pussy energy I think is Def Ryland but Shane.. bb boy.. you def got right throat energy 😂😂 I think it’s fair
Please do a podcast!!!!!
its fucked up because it was hacked with a machete type of knife and fast and tossed in the box. But I missed you worked there in high school was so fun bunch of high schoolers cutting it up . Missed you so much you made me crack up
Miss u so much , glad u came back
I love seeing you happy and joking around.
I work at a few Pizza places in my time, and whenever you cut the pizza sometimes depending on the quality as the dough that business uses, after they cut it the pizza might shift and the cuts might be a little more deep than the rest. Next time ask him not to cut the pizza and you'll see that the pizza will be what you're expecting. Edit: upvote this post so Shane might see this
Ehhhhh.....
why are a majority of his comments supportive, it’s fucking weird
I have missed your sense of humor! 😂
My soul is happy watching this video,  thank you Shane for the light you bring, and the humor.  Literally can't get enough 🥰
33:00 LMAOOOO
Just ask for the pizza to not be cut. Then bring your own pizza cutter.
It is lovely that you are Back!
I miss u Shane. So happy to see you’re back .
You didn’t show the 3rd pizza  Now I have to sit here and wonder what it looked like Thanks Shane
I am dying to try those cookies but seeing all the posts on Instagram about how much they literally throw out each night sickens me.
uncomfortable to watch.
Omg wait shane and chucky should collab and make a pizza called the shane special with pork on it and the drink being diet a&w since the pig and a&w are shanes thing
I need a conspiracy about aliens!!!!
i missed you Shane!! pls don’t leave again lol
are these people a bunch of bots? this video fuckin sucks lmao
Love this can’t wait for more videos Shane! ❤️
As soon as you remember this man is 34 in a few months it just becomes sad and cringe
Just marry Ryland already 🤦‍♀️
It's unwatchable ! It gives migraines! It's about nothing ! There's barely one full sentence there that makes sense !
....you know damn well what people are calling you when they say "P" you're not dumb... You sexualized children... What do you expect??
We don’t forget, Shane.
i don't wish death upon anybody but if i did, this man would be the first person added to my list.
Yayyyyy he’s back!!
Shane this is the most I have  related to you. Ever!
I JUST LOOVE SHANES PERSONALITY....SOMTHING THE CANCEL CULTURE CAN'T CHANGE
LOOSE THROAT HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Shane snorts when he laughs just like me! I am not a big fat guy either!
We made it!
"if you're watching this video you get it" yes unfortunately, but baby we made it 😭
Ok... The opening... Facts proven (not)!
It’s official the snort is psychological
Good vid but not a fan of the fake laughs and trying too hard to be funny and quirky. It’s not necessary. Looking forward to the podcast.
Is that guy really your brother? From that 1 minute clip I’m really concerned for his mental health if he truly believes all that.
omg pleeeeeeeaseeeeeee make a video at disneyland
This was so good, i enjoyed it and it cracked me up!
It could be called "PROBLEMATIC PODCAST" XD Embrace it, and let the drama channels go crazy and cry about it..and since being cancelled is a trend you can invite all the cancelled youtubers and talk to them about it !!
I’m so happy your back 🥰🥰
🅿️
HAHAHAH "mixed"
JUST GO AWAY ALREADY
I've missed this so so much! My week is better already
Shane stop talking down on yourself Dammit
Shane's lawyer to the secretary "Shane is back and his mouth is moving...clear my schedule for the next 2 years would you?"💚👏🤣
Ryland called you a pig 🐖 🐽 lol
At least it’s better than Rylands bull 💩
Someone clearly just needs some coin
No one asked you to come back…
Shane is so shady it’s hilarious his humour is the best 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
hey shane i know you probably won’t read this but in case you do i just want you to know that the whole time watching this i didn’t stop smiling or laughing. just like i always did watching your videos years ago. you have such a beautiful energy that shows in your videos. thank you for coming back & for doing what you do best, bringing people happiness through your content 💜💜
“i won’t talk about myself”   proceeds to talk about himself nonstop.
Well whoever is playing me HATES MY FREAKING GUTS and has given right up lol
Hahaha all this vagina talk is what I miss from Shane idgaf what y’all think it’s fuckin hilarious 😂🤣 the knick knack Shane not so much 😂
Shane, omg! I missed you so much! So glad to see you still cracking jokes like you always did.
The camera man is a no for me sorry
Tbh this is exactly what i want... not another ghost related video lol
NOT CANCELLED ANONYMOUS IM CRYYYYING 😂😂😂
Shane knows the bisex struggle hahahahaha :D those dreams omg :D I've been there hahahah
I'm just so glad you finally uploaded again! It could have been a video of farts and I would have thumbs up that bitch 😂❤️
love you shane ❣️
Like do u not understand ??? We want u off youthbe for good. Not a new video.
im a gen z, but i dont know what that P thing means, it just suddenly popped up in my feed. Must be a rich person thing
I have not laughed this hard in so long Thank you Shane 🤣😊
I love how obvious it was to me that if someone took a lawsuit on you it was probably chuck e cheese
Missed my BFF Shane ❤️
Watching your videos always takes my mind to 2018-19, I missed laughing like this!!  Glad you're back. Also how is he meant to change and grow as a person if he doesn't even get a chance
This video was definitely worth the wait for a shane Dawson video!!! Shane’s humor and his energy cracks me uppp!!!! Love you Shane!!!!!
I reallly need this podcast to happen! I need to listen to something during work !!!
Yasssss omgggg i cantrt waitttt

This is what stays from a whole pizza they sell only slices from it. I know that. I am an Israeli. But they can sell it as a pizza that made special.
You are back!!! My life just got better!  ❤️

ready to see how this new and improved chapter treats you and how you treat it (:
She said cancled anonymous she said Ellen isn't coming to the meetings LMFAOOO that's how yk it's real bad
The thing is they don’t have to do that like it’s not saving that much money plus even if the restaurant is having a slow day they still have a mis match pizaa so unless they keep them their and recycle them for like a week it wouldn’t make sense why they would do it,, even in Saudi Arabia it’s the same thing. That being said because it’s put back in the oven for like 3 or 5 minutes it kills any bacteria so there’s hardly any risk. Also if they recycle a pizza and serve it then recycle some of the pieces again there’s no way it would be edible so it’s just weird either way you slices it’s just doesn’t make sense
I can’t quit laughing this was 🔥 thank you for random laughs
hold up... $80 for 3 pizza boxes?? ummm
I Thank God your in the world Shane 🌎 🙏 😁
You make me so happy, shane:))
It cost $80 for 3 pizzas?!
not gonna lie, everytime I pass by that exact chuck e cheese I think of how iconic it is bc you guys filmed the og pizza video there
I really missed you and your videos!
I love you Shane through it all from the start lol .. Rylan is a gold digging  cross dressing tool .. and I bet my life you give him anything when he cries ..
GO AWAY
I really missed seeing your videos, youtube isn't the same without you:(
If I can be REAL HONEST. I’ve watched this video 3x 😭😭 i still crack up so much 🤣🤦🏻‍♀️. I know everyone has a busy life but WE LOVE TO WATCH YOUR VIDEOS PLEASE MADE MORE FOR US. WE LOVE YOU BABBBBYYYY 😭😭😭😭😭
ugh but now I need to know the TRUTH behind the pizza
You are P P
Awe that's so cute Shane's brother is describing a human with 5 senses 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The geniusness of this video being a sequel to a video from like 4 years ago
Watching your videos always takes my mind to 2018-19, I missed laughing like this!!  Glad you're back. Also how is he meant to change and grow as a person if he doesn't even get a chance 🙄
I'll never forget when I first found your channel at the age of 10. So many late nights were spent binge watching your videos with my best friend on the weekends. I will forever cherish those moments. And- though you've never met me, you've been a huge part of my life from the age of 10 to now the age of 24. When you left YouTube, it was almost like I had lost part of my family. I can't tell you how many times I'd refresh YouTube, hoping you'd be back. You've helped me through the darkest of times and I've loved watching you grow with your channel. I look forward to many more years of binge watching your content. I don't think you'll ever fully understand just how happy I am that you're back 🖤thank you for many years of laughter, tears and for simply just being my safe space.
You groomed an entire generation
Love you Shane
Shane ordering Chuck E. Cheese “regular or stuff crust” “a mix” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Oh god not this again
Lmao
I’m this is weird but I live in cali up north , I order doordash and I order this pizza restaurant called Pasquallys and I just found out that chuckee cheese makes the pizza but it comes out perfect
Seriously.... the pizza is that way because it's probably sliced before it is put into the oven...the edges do not line up because of shrinkage. They probably slice it first, so maybe the toppings do not slide off (if using something like a plastic cutting tool that isnt sharp)  and maybe to save time.
I have missed your humor so much. 😭 I was smiling the whole time! Thank you for coming back. ♥️ Never go away again.
at this point, if you guys don't have crumbl cookies at your wedding, I will be very shocked
I fucking love you!! So glad your back 🥺💛💛💛💛
“chucky we’re friends!!” has me dead af every single time 😂
https://youtu.be/euq72pFKBRw, Shane trying to justify pedophilia!!!
Honestly Shane, I would smash 😂 but seriously best video I’ve seen !! I love your content! KEEP POSTING. We want to see that shit 💖✨
Lol good laughs 🤣 soo happy you are back 😄
It’s nice seeing Shane’s brother more now .
I’m late but let me grab my robe
I am two minutes in. I will edit after watching. So far though... I'm liberal and in Colorado and we don't claim him. I had such high hopes too.  Edit; Fast forwarded to the end because I got so fucking bored ten minutes in. No one actually misses your "ratchet" (more read as questionable content)... Do. Something. Worthwhile. Give us something to actually get behind and support. Some of us are old enough to know you can become better. So do that.
CHUCKIE CHEESE PIZZA ANSWER. The pizza is also sold by the slice. So when someone orders a whole pizza they just fill in the spot. Making sure the first pizzas that are cooked are the first pizzas sold. Instead of serving an entire fresh pizza they give you the older one and  fill in where they have sold slices.
P
Shane you are my comfort YouTuber I love you!! I’m glad you’re back I missed you thank you so much you have helped me through illness <3
So uhhh… when you gonna spill the beans about Trasha?? Cuz I know a LOT of people would love to hear the TRUTH.
Shane should pick one fan every week to interview for the podcast, or have a form where people can submit why they should be interviewed!! Feel like that would be interesting!!
This is halarious
This was so fucking funny lmao 🤣
Our Chuck-E-Cheese’s sells pizza by the slice so could they possibly be using those pizzas to make a whole…? I’m tempted to order a pizza tomorrow and see what it looks like. 🤔🤤
Gotta love the Shane fan girls that will flock to his uploads like flies on shit despite this being genuine NOTHING CONTENT. He acts all dramatic over….pizza? It’s sold by the slice you idiot. There. Video over. Sheesh 🙄
pizza pizza pizza gd im hungry
I love how you guys pick and choose which *pe do philes* you love to support. All of you guys deserve the incinerator.
I miss these types of videos and humor from Shane❤️ I love you guys !
wdym lawsuit bruu?!😂im too high to watch this whole video, i use to watch ur conspiracy videos tho🔥🔥
Shoulda went inside disguised 🥸
I love you!!! ❤️
37:10
I’ve literally had this same thought someone bout time do a video about it
I want those money pants so bad, I could die.
please stop posting <3
I love this.
HOLD UP EIGHTY DOLLARS FOR 3 PIZZAS?
Glad to see you back Shane!!
i am so uncomfortable
Just the other day, out of no where I had the thought “I wonder if Shane misses vaginas. I guess this answers that question 🤣
🅿️ vibes only 😂😍
If we are in a game simulation is the person controlling us also in a simulation controlled by a person in a simulation and on and on
love you, shane…and everything you create. thank YOU!
I missed this so much! I love all the positivity “🅿️” everyone is giving to you! You definitely deserve this, we all love you guys! Keep up the good work and just be you and happpy :))
honestly what if they just suck at making the pizza shape and cutting them?
So I live 10 minutes away from that shopping center…. Can confirm Chuck E Cheese was closed for most of COVID.
I had forgotten how fucking funny you guys are!! Had me dying!!!
I love you, that’s all I have to say
apologize and mean it bruh
It’s so awesome to see Shane acting like his old quirky self again. I’ve missed it.
The music when he says he is going to google it
Shane you would be the WORST PRANK CALLER 🤣 I can see it now, sitting beside you on speaker trying to prank call someone and you busting up laughing and getting everyone cracking up before the joke even 🤣
For the ones who didn’t think they’d make it to 2022! Keep on keeping on homies
This is everything I love that your back baby I will buy it all money pants and all and it will fit come on help a girl out. I would were them everywhere I'd die.
Imagine if you had returned the pizza and they just gave them to the next customer 🤣
TPE crewwwww , I started watching 👀  you because of the conspiracy theories.  I had a slight lazy eye when I was younger but it corrected itself.  Glad to see you back
How about talking to drew,Shanna,and alot of the old crew
Ryland is so cute!
Fucking cring.
19:06 ONG LMAOOO
Me when he said my name, Chrissy: 😳😯
Ok for all the people trying to debunk this pizza issue. It's so simple just order a pizza so specific that no one else would order therefore there probably isn't any pizza slices that specific to recycle. If the pizza is still odd shaped they probably aren't recycling slices.
Wait why cant the conspiracy inventory be sold?
Love you Shane
I get it!🤣
I missed your family so much I still love you and always will
Literally cannot believe all of y'all just gonna continue supporting this dude like nothing happened 😐
Y'all are sick on g
I think Shane you really need to make a vlog channel and show us you know this kinda side of you because it’s not just conspiracy’s that we want it’s you!!! We wanna see more of you and just have fun being you!! 🤍🤍🤍
Haven’t laughed at a YouTube vid in so long omg didn’t even realize how much I missed Shane ❤️
SHANE KEEEP POSTING YOU MAKE ME RETHINK MY LIFE IN A GOOD WAY
The remark about Ceelo Green if you put down your black face mask did not need to be included, did it? Included at the end of the video for what reason?
"Can pizza get COVID?" Bruh😂
I NEED that Conspiracy jacket!!
Chuck E. Cheese watching 👁👄👁
CANCELLED ANONYMOUS!!!
I’m ALWAYS so happy to see you! I know you ‘joked’ about being ooooh republican 🙉 & Im NEITHER BECAUSE THEYRE ALL CRIMINALS…. BUT, take a look around you & who’s trying to destroy your life over foolishness, nonsense, maybe a few youthful mistakes IF EVEN… all the hypocrite liberals/‘social justice warriors’ 🙄 who literally destroy everything perpetuating the LIES of the criminals in office (I just mentioned) who want division. Something to think about.  •It saddens me to see you bring up & support other people who literally will not associate with you anymore -again, over the ignorant, hypocrite culture of liberalism 🤦‍♀️  As someone who’s lived their entire life in a poor urban neighborhood that none of ‘the woke’ would step foot in to spend their money, it’s all so gross. YOU GUYS MAKE ME SO HAPPY & HOPE YOU GO VISIT YAKS AT JEFFREE LYNN’s SOON💙 Also, get back to old school videos! You & camera & conspiracy theories, true crime, AND MINI FOOD FOR CHEETO, SILLY MAKEUP PRODUCTS 💙💙 DEFINITELY DO ANOTHER PODCAST BUT NOT LIKE YOUR LAST ONE TALKING TO THE GOONS I JUST MENTIONED -YOU JUST SAID ‘CELEBRITIES’ WOULD BE ON YOUR PODCAST, NO!! NO! These are exactly the monsters who will turn around & stab you in back!! You’re brilliant with content -you can DO BETTER THAN ‘CELEBRITY & INFLUENCER’ hypocrites!! LOVE YOU & NEVER LEAVE US AGAIN😂💙
Nice to see you back.
OMG I'm so happy that you finally posted I cannot stop laughing I love this video
Um no. Everyone will see one day. Every tounge will confess Yahwehs name!!!!! Yall ain't gotta believe me I'm just forewarning you so your excuse can't be " I didn't know. "
P3d0
for me, this is better than a conspiracy video. just seeing you be yourself again makes me really happy! missed you so much (:
I want merch with red horse and bar dino on it. And the shirt will say "I make impulse purchases". jk love them thout it w funny
I cackle laughed in the fist 2 minutes
#PeaceAndLove

tell your camera man to stop snorting and giggling so much.
So happy I got the notification missed the videos !! ❤❤❤
Yay Shane :)
I miss these on God 🤣🤣🤣
Actually cried when I seen the notification 😭♥️ missed you Shane
Waiting for the "I am the only thing on my to do list" merch. 💜
No just no
Ugh, I am so happy Shane is back :)) his videos make everyday so much better <3
I speak in no uncertain terms when I say this is objectively not funny and the worse thing I spent 5 minutes of my time on.
Manager inside Chuck E. Cheese window: 👁 👄 👁
I like that there’s an urgent care right next door to the chuckee cheese lmao
Get the STUFFED CRUST!!  See how that one is, theres no way they could piece them 2gether like that! Im super curious bc ive never eaten at a Chuck E Cheeses - theres none by where we live in MN
I missed Shane’s little documentaries 😭 Idc what it’s about
I liked him better cancelled
🅿️ means player” lol like guys that get around a lot
Back in the day conspiracy theories were fun and mostly harmless, nowadays with so much misinformation and conspiracy theorists in high levels of government, they're not so fun and are pretty damaging. Please, please be careful with that content going forward.
Shane isn't 🅿️
am i seeing a fork mark in that slice of pizza?????
okay so is he actually back, back?? im looking forward to it. lol
i missed Shane’s humor. 😂
the last 30 seconds im dead LOL
bro he’s such an asshole to ryland
The oreilly bit sent me
My life is whole again. Not sarcasm
shane dawson is literally the worst type of person 🤦🏻‍♀️
So glad you’re back! I missed random videos like this!
Missed you!!!
the fact that ALL of these comments are supporting a man that has built his platform off of racism and pedophilia just shows how much of a joke cancel culture is and how y'all will let a man that has done inexcusable things
Fun fact i work at crumbl but in Georgia
Hopefully he finally finds himself, but WILL continue to make conspiracy videos
Be glad there is not a dislike button
Podcast yes x100000000000
can't wait for more catfker videos with youtube's oldest puffy-faced nobody!  You're my hero.
I missed you ❤️
P3d0
SHANE I'LL BE ON ANY AND EVERY EPISODE OF YOUR PODCAST.  Please drop it asap. AND INVITE ME ON IT WHENEVE.  I'd love the ability to listen to your voice regularly again and to hear about your life in general SO much. 🖤
L
He seems happier
Shane, no shade but use cetaphil moisturizer (the one from costco) it changed my life
Thank you for making this awful week 100% better in 43 minutes.
Señor Pooh 🤪
Shane! You can make anything. I will watch! ❤️❤️❤️ just seeing your growth and happiness has been so amazing! Can’t wait for more vids from you.
YES SHANEEEE YOURE MY FAVORITE
so we won’t talk about the whole mexican joke…? ok then
Marry Ryland. He is too good to not marry.
Shane’s sense of humor is so unique and only he can do what he does. I’m so happy to see him back. Hope he keeps uploading and making our days better. Love from a fellow creator <3
Maybe they make 1 pep 1 cheese and cut it in half, put o e of each half into a box and boom there's your exact half and half. The other halfs go out into a serving case maybe? I've never been to Chuck e cheese so idk what their set up is like. Also for the gaps its probably just from cheese melting down through the cuts.
A pizza could get covid technically except it would be called a surface contamination
Im glad there’s an urgent care in the same area as chuckee cheese
Kinda weird y’all are acting like everyone forgot why he left. Dude is creepy af.
The people in this comment section trying to justify what shane did by diminished the severity of it is simply disgusting. Anyone who finds children attractive is a beast!!!children aren't meant to be looked at in such a way!
There’s literally no excuse for that pizza
I believe the internet, and video games are proof The Matrix is real.
wait so y’all spent $80 on 3 pizzas at chuck e. cheese???
Pls do ur food videos
I have so missed you! I haven't laughed this hard in so long!! Glad you're back!!
I'm so glad you're back!!
missed you shane :) you look better and happier
Literally have not been more excited for new shane vids. Idgaf about you getting cancelled I’ll always be here 😂
Shane.. you def have adhd
Can’t wait for more! Had a blast watching it, laughed a ton & it helped readjust my overwhelmed & overstressed mood. Thank you!
You are a beast!
let's take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into the  content for us ngl...
So why not just ask them to not cut the pizza? Problem solved.
The only guess I have about the pizza is that maybe they cut it right out of the oven and slide it into the box, then the cheese starts to cool down and keeps the pizza slices where they landed when sliding into the box—or if they use a mezzaluna type cutter maybe it gets stuck on the blade and falls out of form?
Cause rats eat trash omggggg nooooo!!!😭😭😭😭
This video had me like 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I worked and managed a CEC for 4 years 🤣 its transfered from a metal baking screen onto a giant cutting board that has a handle, then cut with a 2ft curved blade that has handles on both ends. To cut the pizza you rock the blade back and forth a few times, then use the handle on the cutting board to transfer it into a box or tray 🤣 the raised bumps on the trays are to help cool it down fast so you play games, can eat it fast, play games and order a new one. Because we would never reheat someone's already slobered over pizza because eew 🤣 that rat costume is never washed though 🤢
I missed you. ♡
I worked at CEC in high school and was hospitalized from food poisoning.  I played in the ball pit after hours and it was so nasty.  Please keep your kids away!
It's like yall seriously forgot about all the reasons he was canceled. Shane clearly came back because he wanted to wait until yall forgot about all those thing we dragged/canceled him for. Yall are weird and dumb.
I will always lmao with Shane, we literally have the same humor 🤣
Bring back SHANANAY Shane!!
Ryland shining the light on Shane reminds me of Regina’s mom during the Jingle Bell Rock dance.
What's ryland talking about, shane still "honks" all the time 😆
I genuinely think you should do a “redemption” podcast… maybe talk to other celebrities ie tana and azalea banks and other celebrities that have been “cancelled” and interview them about how they’ve grown since their cancellation?? Show how people can grow after their mistakes… give an opportunity for the audience to be more forgiving and the cancelled person to seem more human!
Jesus Christ love you
is he filtering hate comments?
idc what has happened or any of the drama that ever happened for about an hour when watching his videos
I see no negative coments, I wonder why that is 🙄
oh Please call him Chris Crumbl !!!
pushing p pushing p
This isn't funny
if your reading this..... your a bear
I literally get so excited when you post videos. I'm mad I'm two days late 😬 I would love listening and/or watching your podcast 😍 You're so funny and I'm glad you're getting back into the game of making content.
Oh how I have missed your and Rylands vids 🥰
Shane please post more content I have been missing this sm
Lmao i swear if they try to come for you again my kids will never go there again, ps we never eat the food there😂🙈🙊
Proof this year is going to be great…Shane is back!
Shane’s not pushin 🅿️
Shane doesn't have anything to worry about Rylan loving it so much there is a urgent care in the same parking lot 🤣🤣🤣.
Wonder if Kanye West has reached out to Shane for a Cancel Collab yet, and Shane was like NAAAAH IMA NOT DO THAT but thaaanks
This comment section did not pass the vibe check 🤡
Shane your trying to hard  to be funny, that’s your old humour, a little cringy & I see that Rylans feelings look a little hurt a few time.  You may have to edit a few things.
Shane in a truck is a whole mood
Missed your videos! Please make more conspiracy theorie videos they’re my favourite and I miss them so much! Glad you’re back and doing well can’t wait to watch more new videos.
, i’m so glad you’re back
Depression curing content🥰
keep the camera straight, that whole shaky cam was making me sick and getting me out of the video immersion
PLEASEEE DO A PODCAST SHANEEE YES YOURE HILARIOUS TO LISTEN TO
Im so glad you're back :)
Chuck E leave me alone!
Loved every second of this video!!
ROTFLMAO! Thanks Shane, I needed this 😂😂😂
i love you
Haven't taken my kid to chuck e cheese since your video (and others) and I still won't. I've heard that rumor was before you even made a video
It's so goooooooooood to have you back in business. We ain't bored no more💪🏾
Shane is so funny. This literally turned my bad day around ☺
I would never admit to this if my parents were still alive but yeah , try walking in on ur parents and ur mom is giving head😭😭 i had to stare at the Sun for a hot min to blind myself and get that image out of my head😂🙈 no pun intended, but yeah thats y my vision is horrible now at 34 lmao
Shane … when I tell you I NEEDED THIS
Okay absolutely no offense to Shane.. But he is literally me when i’m high as all hell LOL…. I smoke consistently.    P.S. I’m kind of proud of “high me,” she cool asf.
We Missed You 💓
I need that conspiracy jacket at 19:37
That's why we meditate to separate from the person the voice in the  head, The thoughts.!💗💗💗💗💗💗
Ily Shane keep going ❤️❤️
Here's something I don't want? If Shane's in it I ALWAYS wanna watch!
SHANE CHUCK E. CHEESE IS ON DOORDASH
Love you Ryland you’re so adorable
😅 guys sliding pizza into a box isnt always easy and you definitely can't get a perfectly round crust unless it's already a pre-made crust 🤷‍♀️😅🤣 you should see the pizza I try to slide into a pizza box at work 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
23:05 the wall hang should be in your office Shane!!!!
Pls talk abt how they are legit trying to micro chip us !! With a stupid corona micro chip that lets you know if you have it or not WHAT ! Shane there’s so much stuff that you’ve talked abt in past conspiracies that are actually happening today pls talk abt them !
What hoodie is Ryland wearing at the beginning? So cute!
Omg it’s 14 on trending. Also do you still have the same P.O. Box what about in Colorado
Seriously though how the fuuuuuuudge does their pizza look like that? I really don’t want to have to get a job there just to fking find out. THE PEPPERONI DOESNT FKING LINE UP!!!!
omg imagine if Shane had that dream about Ryland having a vegina because he wants children so bad, so he dreamt of actually being able to make kids with Ryland
Its good to see you happy Shane!
this video is just all over the place LOLLLL, I love it.
This is literally unwatchable
OMG MY NAME IS CHRISSY
I love you so much Shane!!! I’m your biggest fan!! Like when you stopped making videos it broke me !! You have helped me get through a lot of shit, you raised my confidence !! I watch all your videos!! Fuck the haters I’ll follow you and support you forever!!!
Ugh, I needed the serotonin refill this week 🙏🏼 Thank you Shane, Chris, and Ryland!!!
Shane’s 🅿️ushin 🅿️ 😂😂
Watching you and Ryland no matter the content is so great!! Love your videos and seeing you happy! You’re such a genuine human❤️
ok ik i love this, shane coming back and everything..but no one can deny ryland wants to throw hands with chris FHDGSGS
🤍🥺🤍🥺 yaaayy love u all!
Jesus Christ is Lord. Please take your salvation seriously. It is all True. Read the Bible and do what it says. It's more important than you know.
Thank you for your awsome content 🖤
Also ngl the truck bit was pretty funny at the beginning
Shane how are you belong eugina Clooney now after she just got out of rehab? You’re never going to admit your wrong doings on that.
I honestly love these kind of videos
Not saying anything about whether I do or do not like anyone and I never promote hate but is your comment section being vetted or something cause like it’s good to see a lot of people happy about your content and that they enjoy it but NO WAY all the people who bring up your past just disappeared in one video lmfao
Yay! So happy for you Shaney!  As long as you're happy I'm happy!  Well done you for being so real! Love you 💖
here comes onision griping about shane next.
This was great!!! Enjoyed it so much!! Love y’all!!
Why is this being allowed most people know this is wrong
🅿️
We can be controlled by the Holy Spirit. The voices are demons though, alot of times! Be careful.
GLAD YOUR BACK!!!Fricken took you long enough.😂
Very surprised at all the positive comments on this video. I made it 2 min in... I hope he figures something out because in 10 years, YouTube is definitely not going to be supporting his lifestyle. I hope they bought land with all that make up money XD
INVITE ME SHANE IM YOUR BIGGEST FAN
Chris Crumble 🤣🤣
Omg, I haven't laughed this hard in a long time Miss you Shane!
You videos give me comfort. I’m glad you’re back Shane.
I loveddddddd Shanes old podcast, bring it back!!!! And make it just as dirty
Don't they sell pizza by the slice too?? It would make sense if they had cut several pizzas out for individual sale and when someone orders a whole pizza, they just put together what's out and already cut.
39:17 Shane: “I’m not a doctor.”  Me: “I am tho! 😂 it’s all about moderation and variety guys. Pizza is fine once in a while. Pizza daily is bad. Chuck E. Cheese pizza daily is problematic. 😂
This man literally black faced and shit but he still isn’t cancelled.. why?
Happy to see you creating again 😊💜
So glad to see you back. I'm actually not a big fan of conspiracy theory videos so it doesn't bother me. I'm just Here for you. I'm skeptical that it's not a conspiracy theory video though. I'm only a couple seconds and I know how much your brother loves conspiracy theories lol
I cant be any happier!!!! Shane is finally  back!!!!! Cheers to the conspiracy theories , we fkg adore you shane! Missed u so much we re over the moon to have you back, you rock
This reminded me of the Techfoot episode of icarly hahaha
🤢🤢🤢😐😐😐
Honestly 4got u guys were engaged lol
Omg the whole entire simulation theory I have recently also realized like I thought it was just me who also believed this wow!!! I live in Colorado Shane,  close to you and not in a creepy way I just recognize alot of your locations bc I am a Colorado native. I also work for one of the biggest corporations and highest paid owners yes Amazon... I work at one of the biggest fulfillment centers and and I whole heartedly believe Amazon also uses us a simulation. I have so many conspiracy theories just surrounding Amazon in general I think you would love to hear. If you ever want to sit down and chat I think you would be highly interested let alone entertained from my jaw dropping realizations and theories about Amazon. Let me know :)
can’t lie, i missed him and he rlly is a comfort youtuber for me <3
I love how he hasn't been here for a long time and yet his subscribes still adore him and pretend as if he was never gone <3 I'm one of those subscribers
Shane opening that pizza box like he’s a model on Deal or No Deal. 😂
im so happy right now i love this
Do us all a favor and go back into hiding cause I legit hate that people are allowing you too come back.
Lmao it’s so nice to have you and your snort back shane 😂😂😂 i missed you in my life! When you were gone and i was feeling down i would always go back to your old videos to put a smile on my face
Fricckkk I missed you so much. Don’t tease with me about those daily uploads, I still watch all of those videos over and over 💜
🅿️ is pushing p it starts for pimp😭
drop a fucking conspiraey video you will make mony in quartine
Can u do one at every pizza place to see the difference?
Hey, @YouTube pay Shane, I only like YouTube for him!
🐈     🏃‍♂️💨
Please keep uploading Shane. I miss your videos and it has been very hard lately to catch up on my college classes.
Omg, I missed you sooo much! Please marry Ryland already, he is your soulmate! Yes, I am a Republican! Omg 😁!
Did anyone else notice how he kept being mean to Ryland and played it off as a joke? I had a friend like that and it’s all fun n games but those back handed remarks/jokes build up over time and really make someone feel bad.
We not in a sminulation it is just god
What if they cut the pizza and then they pickup the slices and place them down not in the same order that they picked them up in so then it becomes mix match
https://youtu.be/aQcDWIRdDFY
27:49 omg Demi looks great here
Ur videos bring me seratonin! Please don’t stop making them
If you don’t hurry up and marry Ryland, I will.
26:46 why does Shane have Jlo’s old dress?
I was laughing so hard I started crying this is so funny I have missed you so much thank you for making my day better
please don’t come back please don’t come back please don’t come back
so happy to see you living your best life! remember you're doing great and fuck what anyone else thinks! ♡
17 THOUSAND comments and 2 MILLION views in 4 days? Haters better recognize. Haha! That doesnt happen for everyone's videos
We miss u dammit
Whole video fucking hilarious 😂
I'm by myself and I am dying of laughter.
Don't knock Republicans, my daughter and I (who is 21 and bisexual) have always supported you! The left canceled you, not us! Keep doing your magic!
Okay seriously, the camera dude laughing at every single word out of their mouths is extremely annoying
Thank you x
“Let’s get you in that suit” 37:43 lmaoooo I about died
I needed this video today. Thank you Shane, Ryland and Chris.
I do miss Shane and friends so much. Happy your getting into it again
I was dyinngggg at Shane’s face When he opened the pizza😂😂😂 chuck E was just mad you exposed them😂😂😂 because facts are facts sawettiieeee💁🏾‍♀️😂
Okay but Shane looks good? Like he looks like he’s definitely been taking better care of himself and he looks a little smaller.
This is one of the worst things I’ve ever witnessed

We missed you ♥️
I LOVE THIS. Wow Shane, so sosos SO PROUD OF YOU!!!!!! Love you guys so much. So glad to see you in such a great mood!!!! So real love it so much. Miss yas!!!❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏👏👏

Ryland: showing his IDGAF attitude Shane: are you the Chucky cheese spokesperson? Me: Pissing myself laughing so hard.

Omg pleaaaseeeee do a podcast, it is February and I need something ❤️❤️❤️
Shane literally having veitnam flashbacks when that pizza box opened .😂💀
i was laughing so hard during the whole video 😂😂😂
Honey Jamie Lynn is hosting the meetings 🤣.. that girl is not “P” she is “C”….
Ryland, I love you and if I was a gay man, I would marry you instantly. 😘💖
I haven’t laughed so much in so long! We love yours and Rylands videos! Can’t wait to see what is next! Also you guys made us try crumbl cookies and it was not a regret! 💜
Ryland eating the pizza anyway is a mood...God i can't believe the pizzas still look like that xD
Isn’t this the ped 0philiac? Oh right it is the ped 0philiac named Shane the keep your kids away Dawson, pretty f#%ked up how a ped 0 is even allowed a platform on YouTube huh?
I am so excited to see you!!!!!
Chuck E is also a mouse, not a rat.
I'm so glad you're back!!! Best content ever 🥰😍

You've been missed, Shane!!!
Okay. I worked at Chuck E. Cheese as a teenager. I was in the costume, and I was the one who took the tickets for toys. Now this was like 30 years ago, but the one I worked at made their pizza to order. I think maybe those pieces of pizza actually fit before it was baked, the cheese and dough rested or it was moved. But Idk 🤷‍♀️
they need to go to like Pizza Hut, Dominoes, Papa Johns, Little Ceasars , Costco/Sams Club and gets half and half pizzas and see if they line up or not then. Like does other places look like that? Like when I worked at Sams Club it looked like that and we definitely didn't switch the pizza slices around.
So they moved back to LA 😀
You HAVE TO NAME THE PODCAST SHANE & FRIENDS YOU HAVE TO
Man forget these ppl I loved Shane he did something back then and bring it up I hate this generation I miss the old Shane wish we had more content but this world is a mess then it already is
Yeah, the video no one asked for, and the YouTuber no one wanted back is back, the good side is I forgot to unsubscribe and thanks to this I finally did :)
Is that your brother Shane? I forget his name but it looks like him
I’ve never seen Shane so happy and confident in a video 💕 so happy that he’s in this new place in his life
I haven't genuinely laughed this much in a while.  😂
ngl i missed u lol
lmfao...video starting off about sex. may as well be sponsor or Adam and Eve XD btw the urgent care by chuckee cheeses lol..
Love this and you! I’m so glad you seem to be getting back to your element and being happy ☺️ can’t wait for the next vid
Gets accused of pedophilia and other offensive shit from past. First thing you know what will be fun going to chuckee cheese. Wtf creep
Trash
dislike
Sandals Resort wedding!
Also I agree with Susie W., your videos have always been my happy place in this world of craziness and with each new video that you make I can just feel how much happier you are and it makes me so happy just to watch ☺️ ILY and always will ❤️ (ps I cannot wait for your podcast!)
welcome back shane i’m so happy your back one day i would like to interview you when i’m older :3
This video was HILARIOUS 😂 can't wait for the next 1
please make a podcast it will be iconic
Bro I need you to do better
Loved it plz don't stop being you.
The fact that you continued on the Chuck E. Cheese conspiracy from a couple years ago made me so happy. Love you Shane!
Okay ummmmm I have missed Shane wtf!
glad ur back
2:33 you're bipedal (walk on two legs)
shane looks dead inside #pforpedo
I enjoyed this! Sometimes it’s nice to just hangout with Shane Ry.
37:30 I missed Shane so much and his humor keep it up dude :)
Why should he genuinely be allowed back on YouTube? His supporters are delusional.
If you only knew how many lives you have helped and saved the world needs Shane Dawson. Don't be so hard on yourself god made you who you are for a reason to bring joy and happiness to people. I just wish we could repay you for everything you have thank you Shane. By the way let me know if you ever need a body guard I'll knock the hell out of someone for you
Annoying
lol funny video
Loved it
I missed this.
I want pizza now🤤🤤🤤
ryland is actually the funniest person i’ve ever seen
Chuck E. Cheese started selling their pizza at grocery stores in the frozen section! I bought me a cheese and pepperoni pizza they were good and PERFECTLY round lol.
I still think you where only canceled cause the government was scared of someone with a big platform exposing conspiracy’s (mainly one that Appeals to a younger generation)
shane my pig hoodie is too big on me now because I lost weight can I have a smaller one ): i will literally send you pictures. I STILL WEAR MY SLIDES THO and people still compliment them ;)  missed you boo but im serious can i mail my hoodie back and get a different size
Love this love that you are not giving into what cancel culture wants keep it up
The pizza thing could be if people order by slice and say 4 pies go in the oven at once and a few people order a couple pieces then they could make a full pie from other pies but it’s all still fresh because it was all made at the same time but just mix match to accommodate people ordering by slice too say one person order two slices of pepperoni and a slice of cheese why waste the whole other half the pizza no that would create so much waste.. it can all still be fresh just miss matched
so happy to see you uploading again! i need these laughs
ive missed shane
CHECK OUT MATPATS FOOD THEORY VIDEO HE DEBUNKED IT COMEPLETLY!!
Can't you just go to the court house and get married then have a big wedding later?
This is just embarrassing
i missed this....
Use me as a dislike button
Love having you back!! ❤️
Shane you motivate me to keep making YouTube videos
23:00 Gotta go to the bathroom and It’s not 🅿️, it’s poop…
Yes yes yes this is what I’ve been waiting for this is what we’ve all been hoping for it’s my birthday week this week so this video made the entire week the cherry on top thank you so much Shane and good luck to you and your video making I’m sure everything will come out the way you want it for us!!!! Thank uuuuu so so much for everything!!!
It’s been forever since I’ve laughed this hard. Thank you Shane, Ryland & Christopher Robin😭🥰😂
❤️
I think I'll go to dominos or Papa Murphy's
omg pls make a podcast , xoxo
Christopher just doesn’t know what way he’s meant to react to half of what Shane says and I’m living for it. And ryland is just out here wondering what having a pussy would be like. Don’t tell me he hasn’t. Probably not before Shane’s dream but now for sure. And Chucky cheese looks lush sorry but then I’m from Uk so maybe my pizza taste is different. But I would totally demolish that in nanoseconds. Don’t care about the shape. It’s calling my name. Love u Shane and co. Good luck going forward and can’t wait for the conspiracy video. Xxxx
IM SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU UPLOADING AGAIN. I missed this so much 😭😭
I love everything you do Shane I wish you would post daily fr
Watching this feels like hanging with a friend 💖
You know what we need? MORE CONSPIRACIES
Missed you!!!
Its the way i need the conspiracy jacket
He has to be delet ing com ments this is insane
There you go   " “Ex-Chuck E. Cheese Employee Responds To Shane Dawson’s Conspiracy,” a YouTuber going by the name Payden offered a perfectly logical explanation: The chain wants its pizzas to have the same number of slices each time, which can present a challenge for rushed kitchen workers. Sometimes, after pulling a pizza out of the oven, he would start cutting it up only to realize that he had 10 slices instead of the 12 that he needed. “You’ll just find a really big piece of pizza and you’ll only cut that one in half,” he said. “Because of that, it’ll start to make a line that doesn’t end up anywhere and stuff like that. It’ll make all of these lines look all funky.” "
Shane I have an idia! 💡 Order a pizza and put a note in all the slices "If you find this note, we all know what that means".  Then return the pizza because you didn’t like it or leave some peaces in their restaurant. I love your videos and I’m so happy you are back!  We need your positivity!  💓
O-O-O'RYLIIIND~ HAS WEE-NIE PARTS! YEAH!
Made me smile and that’s all we need from u 🙌 because doing what u love makes us smile
seriously shane after all you've done and how you got your fame off the awful things you said and did, for the love of god stay off YouTube
SHANE!!!! your videos have brought a smile to my face on some days when nothing else could.  we are so glad to have you back and can't wait to see what you have in store for us!!! <3
Hey Shane I think your brother is mentally unwell. I'm glad that you validate his emotions though and make him feel heard. I hope he has a blissful healing.
We love Disneyland for the same reasons. Me and my boyfriend are both plus size and never fear not fitting
$80!? Chuck E.... No ma'am! Glad you're back!
My noob player must have had his device taken cuz my character ain't doing nadda
You’re right this isn’t what I want Shane.. I want you to never have a platform again
You need mental help All of the people commenting that they’re so happy that your back are either paid or delusional to who you really are
You’re sick Shane
You shouldn’t have a YouTube channel
I can’t wait to see you go to jail!
So… Are we just gonna be okay with him being back orrr..? Just forget about everything he’s done?
So happy to see you back on YouTube… missed you
If only Ryland and Shane knew about "P' as in the song Pushin' P,  they would have had the perfect oppurtunity for when Ryland had to "Pushin' P"
Shame is the best YouTube Hands-down! Don’t ever change 👍 always puts a smile on me and my Gf face
Whats weird is that when he said he did self reflecting for a few years i reasied i gave birth to two kids in the time it took him to get back lol
I can’t wait until you go to prison!
I'm 12 mins in and very very confused...
Who's Shane dawson
This is the content I need, I’m tired of these other channels your videos are different and entertaining
What is actually wrong with you Shane?
Omg, Ryland is me and Shane is my bf. Literally same body shape and personality, just different sexuality. But I love it💕
Cameraman is definitely high🤣
Me completely forgetting Shane used to be with a women even though I watched every video they uploaded
Love this ❤️
Thanks for doing the “Mystery Bundles” on your cool Merch!  I picked up 3 of them… Thanks! 💜
Shane why don't you just go in ask the employees why the pizza looks like that have them make you one that you watch them make fresh and see if it comes out the same exact way it could be due to how they put the toppings on how they cut it Etc, or why don't you just make three of your own pizzas from scratch and see if you can duplicate how there's looks? That wld make for a cool video ? Just an idear
If you do Harry Styles on your podcast I will watch every one of your podcasts
Before you know......you dont know!    Love it need it
Did y’all forget all the shit he did?
Why is she green 😂😂
Nice vid man
All I have to say is I love you guys and love watching your videos.

Me and my brother have been watching you since the beginning. I was so happy to tune in and see you happy!!!I was feeling anxious but I feel like a piece of home is with me(:
Thank you for the fun Shane!!
TPE in the house! 🤣❤ Take my money.
Chuck E Cheese should allow Shane a trial shift for one day in a local branch
“i won’t talk about myself”   proceeds to talk about himself nonstop.
Yea I grew up and this doesn’t entertain me anymore …. Bye thx for my childhood lmao
This video made my day
if you do a podcast, again, you should get Lauren on board.   she is the only one who can handle you haha. you two were such a dream team :)
Omfg!! I’ve missed you and your content!! I’m so glad you exist ❤️  thank you for years of sharing your life with us and the entertainment.
If anyone sees me watching this no you didn’t
there was a fucking Peter Piper Pizza commercial on this video as they were eating the pizza and I was so sure it was about to be a Chuck e cheese commercial and I was going to lose my mind
County Supervisor Admires the Courage of Falun Gong Practitioners Mr. Donald W. Weaver, sponsor of the resolution, was very touched after learning about forced organ harvesting in China. He said it breaks his heart just hearing about it. He called forced organ harvesting evil and genocidal.   Mr. Donald W. Weaver meeting with local Falun Gong practitioners  Mr. Weaver met with Falun Gong practitioner Ms. Chi Lihua and heard her personal experience of being persecuted while in China. He said he admires the courage of Falun Gong practitioners in resisting the persecution.  Ms. Chi and her husband Mr. Xu Dawei were arrested for making materials to raise awareness of the persecution of Falun Gong. Mr. Xu was sentenced to eight years in prison and was brutally tortured. He died 13 days after he was released from prison. Within 100 days of Mr. Xu’s passing, Ms. Chi lost her parents and older brother. Ms. Chi herself was sent to prison four times for her faith in Falun Gong and barely survived the ordeal.   Ms. Chi and her daughter holding pictures of her late husband at a candlelight vigil in Washington, D.C. on July 16, 2021.  Mr. Weaver told Ms. Chi that Americans need to know the truth about the persecution and understand the evil of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He said he admires the courage of Falun Gong practitioners in China and elsewhere for stepping out and telling people about the truth. He called them sparks of hope and encourages practitioners to continue their effort and not to give up.  Mr. Weaver believes that the most important thing for practitioners to do outside China is to expose the persecution and the CCP’s evil deeds in order to end the persecution. He believes every local government should pass a resolution like Fluvanna County has.  Finally Mr. Weaver said he very much agrees with Falun Gong’s principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance, and hopes more people can follow these principles in their lives.
I don’t know what I came across but it’s funny without a direction a bit of everything and anything unexpected, you should add a count of how many times MARRIED comes up 🤣👬
pushing 🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️
I am so beyond happy that you are back shane we all missed you!!
The fact that everyone in the comments is pretending that nothing has happened is fucking exhausting. Quit trying, we all know that what happened is messed up and using "lawsuit" in the title for clickbait is terrible.
I'm so glad to see you posting again! I don't care what it's about, I always enjoy your stuff. I don't really comment on anything but I really wanted you to know you have been missed and are loved ❤️
I LOVE U SHANE SM
Ryland is trying so hard to keep Shane from being sued... Again
not me constantly double clicking the screen to like it when he says a joke 😭😭😭😭😭
I’ve had a bad day and I wanted to watch this video. Had me smiling from start to finish ;’) thank you xx
So many adds in here so let's turn the sound down. You know what I think its time for a yt add countdown  Yt add countdown.
my crush is back
Such an honour to be apart of your channel and watch you grow as a person!! You’re so incredibly smart!! I’m so excited to watch all the videos you’ll make, I’m so proud of you, I’ve been watching since 2010!! I’m so glad to see you thrive! Thankyou for being you, never stop being you!🤍
80 bucks for 2 pizzas!?!?! 80 bucks?!?! Jesus California is expensive ad hell
This was soooo funny it really brightened my day, PLEASE make more like this!!!
No Shane…. Not the Ford😭
🅿️ means playa aka something positive
"Christopher" is Satan, but he probably knows that already. God said mediums, guide's, numerology, divination, astrology, yoga, tarot readings etc is witchcraft and against him. But so is being gay. After all him and Jeffree are Sodom and Gomorrah.. their words.
I worked for Chuck E. Cheese in Indiana and they most definitely didn’t reuse pizza lol. The dough is handmade so it’s not a perfect circle some sides could of been stretched more then another causing it to be uneven after it goes through the oven🙂
“Preach bother “ takes another bite 😂😂😂😅 I’m dead 💀💀💀💀
Shane is pushin🅿️ uploading
The brain is nothing but an organ, the mind is the control of your thoughts emotions etc..
surprised by the lack of racism, thought that was the basis of your brand.  but anyways please go back to being off the internet.  you don't need the money.
The pizza is like that because of the blade they use to cut it. It’s a rocking blade, and it’s very very dull. They use this instead of a sharp rolling pizza blade because of safety purposes (since they work with kids)   also since they cut the pizza at such high temperature, it’s very easy for it to move around and get super wonky
Plan a party at your favorite place, even if that's home, only invite the people you just have to have there, and enjoy life!
Somebody need to order a pizza from there and ask them not to cut slices  Then you see if it's fresh or not.
W video
Did Shane post??? Ooooo yes
You have opened our hearts to Chuckie again thank you! Also we missed you. Welcome to Colorado we are chill hear. Also …… google Chuckie Cheese in Aurora scary.
Not sure how I feel about a bisexual man saying a gay slur??
We made it Shane ✋
Shane. I fucking missed you. Thank you for coming back.
black face
A crumble cookie wedding cake.
fun video
Amazing video!!❤️
Make more conspiracy
Ok wait. Does chuck e cheese sell singular slices? Because then it wouldn’t be ass gross because the pizza wouldn’t have gone out to other people, but it’d have missing pieces from people buying individual pieces so they’d have to fill in those pieces? 😂
The only fat but replace the t with a g i respect
Shane’s podcast was my fav fucking thing in the world I literally quote shît from it till today. LONG LIVE LAUREN SNCHIPPER. Pls do a pod w her

When ryland said “let’s put you in that suit” 😭😭😭😭🥴🥴
Just remember, Shane that not everyone will accept that you’re back. Everything that was said about you was also said back in 2014. I’ve been watching you for a very long time and you’ve been my favorite ever since. I’m glad that you’re growing, I’m glad that you’re doing good so far from what I can see. You look great. Thank you for coming back.
Could CC pizza get Covid? Priceless, but please share the impending Cease and Desist filing. Lmao
I missed your content so much!
I’m SOOO Glad you are back!! And so happy you are thinking about doing the podcast again! You don’t know how much laughter and happiness you bring to my life! I die laughing every time I watch your videos lol. I used to listen to your podcast at work and explode laughing. People would always look at me like I was crazy XD. Pls never stop being you. you are hilarious!

We made it! Lol
I liked it when he wasn't there 😭
I posted a comment awhile back during probably darker times, and seeing the bounce back is so relieving, and satisfying, so I just wanted to say I TOLD YA SO, SHANE!!  The pig army never left, your true fans arent going anywhere!!!  Love you!!
It’s nice to see you back Shane I missed you
Great. More over edited garbage with no point from paste master clown
So happy you decided to upload Shane 😄😄
I'm an OG Shane fan, and I'll always be one. I cannot explain how excited I am to get a new podcast!!! 💗💗💗💗🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Dear Shane, I'm glad you're back on youtube :) I really like your vibe and your positivity. You also ave a fresh look in your eyes, I'm glad you're feeling better. May it only get better from here. ❤️
"Maybe that's why it's a rat, because rats eat trash" lmao that made me bust out laughing
Don’t quite know what this video is but all i do know is that i love it. I loved the editing of this so much. Such unintentional funny video i love itttt
I love anything you film. You and Ryland have become a normal part of my week since COVID-19 began and recovering from multiple back surgeries. I smile on darkest days.
L+ratio
you're still alive wtf
shaneeeee i fuckinf love you
37:07 HAD ME DYING 🤣 welcome back Shane
Something feels forced and not organic
I love this type of content and I'm so happy to see Shane back and doing well!
You are the best 👌  missed you 💖
Shane, you so Handsome in this Guccicloths 👍🏻❤️😃
lmfaooo yo that pizza is SO SUS
why’s no one talking about where is shane’s kill bill shirt from lol?!
I am surprised that after all the crap they got, Chuck E Cheese is still doing something weird with the pizza and they haven’t come out with a legit reason why their pizzas look like that. The pieces genuinely don’t fit or match up. It seems like a dumb thing but it is sketchy when it comes to something people are eating
“Before you know, you don’t know” 😂
Almost 2 M view so happy for you Shane.  (8th comment lol)
Fucking hilarious!! I laughed through the whole video. I would love this type of content mixed in with your conspiracy content ♥️
I can't believe we've let Chuckee Cheese gaslight us for three years
Please god no, don’t let this happen, he who will not be named can’t come back, please no
I want Shane to edit his own vids again this background music thing and the extra pics and stuff isssss new I guess but his own vision is elite
I missed Shane lol
I like how I’m not seeing hate comments ((:
No one will see this comment, but I cut a frozen pizza and it went crazy and didn't  line up back in a circle. Maybe they just cut the pizza haphazardly...
I’m just wondering why I didn’t get a notification that you uploaded a video, I got a notification for Rylands video today, and at the very end I seen what looked like a new video from you, and clicked on it, and here I am, but I like to watch your new videos immediately lol, but YouTube didn’t send me a notification!! Okay now I’m going to watch this and feel all happy inside for 43:23!!
Welcome back Shane!!!
Pizzas sold by the slice should not be included in orders. Bad pizza etiquette
I have missed you so much 😭😭❤️
PLEASE CALL CHRIS - CHRIS CRUMBLE!!!!!!
dont belive google p is essentially “player” yea idk
I don’t find anything interesting about this video
SHANE MFKN DAWSON
Please do a podcast !!! Love you Shane and ryland ♥️♥️♥️
these comments are so obviously filtered...
Please do not upload in another 6 months! More content
You are the best Shane
so glad u are back Shane!! <3 missed ur videos
make private videos, dont post them for everyone to see thats just embarrassing
love to have you back! you have such a special energy that has definitley been missed!
What happened to ryland?? ;(
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Ahhh you've been missed Shane!!!!  Happy to see you back!  Miss your conspiracy vids.
Ohhhh I love Shane <3 So happy for your next chapter

Missed you and missed this kind of content!!! :D
I loved this so much! The only thing is I hope you and Ryland get married one day!
the pizza doe is just rolled unevenly  i think
why tf are ppl pretending like you didnt do what you did
This is the dumbest fucking video I've sat through for 10 mins. What are they laughing so hard at it's like that shit Davi Dobrik does where every single thing that's said is so hilarious.
Shane is such an icon .He’s such a mood, honestly
Hahahaha i needed this
It's because they take two pizza's a put them together lol. You're welcome
This was a really refreshing video, thank you for this shane❤
I wanna cry. I miss this guy.
We dont have enough misinformation around, we need another poorly researched Shane's video... ffs. Shane, please, DONT make another conspiracy theory video. They're paaaainfully bad, no kidding.  btw, Ryland is GLOWING.
where are all the negative comments lol
Anytime I've made my own homemade pizza at home and I cut it and then transfer it to another plate, it always looks ratchet and mismatched too. So I kinda believe Chuck E Cheese!
Im so glad theyre back and this is the content we're getting😂❤❤❤❤
Intimate wedding,we are here for it! 🖤 Marry that man Shane,vagina or not! 😂
Love you!!!!
so happy to see you’re back!
I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, rejection, or pains of loneliness and self-doubt. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of the pains of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9
So HAPPY YOUR DOING THESE AGAIN!PLEASE STAY!!LOVE AND BLESSINGS TO YALL
https://youtu.be/hGKZAPmrsaw
So entertaining and funny happy Shane is back ❤️❤️
You know maybe they cut the pizza all wonky to make it look like "trash" to match the esthetic bc chuckee is a rat and rats eat trash!? 🐀🍕

KING OF YOUTUBE
👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Love you Shane!!!!
You should order one half and half and ask them not to cut it. Then cut it yourself.
as a cool person we say pushin p as the vibe
At little caesars when we cut it wrong it still lines up
So glad to see your funny ass self back on YouTube we missed you!! And Ryland!!
Meanwhile ChuckECheese starts bullying you in a funny way but like hardcore 😭😭
Welcome back dear Shane ❤️
Shane you look great !
😂😂😂
He said podcast, and I was like... “I mean okay.. I’ll listen..” but then he said, “conspiracy’s” and I was like, “ I MEAN OKAY! I will LISTEN!”  😂
OMG I HAVE MISSED U SO SO MUCH YOU CAME IN MY LIFE NOW AT THE EXACT PERFCT MOMENT THANK U SHANE<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<<3<3<3
I absolutely love Shane and all his content I could watch for hours
I MISSED U SHANE PLEASE MAKE MORE VIDEOS THESE ARE SO FUNNY
Lol Shane still got it tho. Like I watched this while working from home and I was laughing like it lifted my mood.
Chris just casually saying " I did walk in on them once"
i needed that❤️
It's nice to watch Shane again! That pizza looks glued together 😂
So badly want the podcast to happen!
I make pizzas everyday at work and none of mine have ever been like that love ya Shane
Why He Look Like Mr.Beast To Me?!😂
I’m so glad he back
I missed you. I adore you. That's all ❤️
Omg welcome back love your videos.
I can not wait for the podcast! This video made cry laughing and I missed that so much. Shane you are so hilarious and we really missed your content.
My husband and I will be married 3 years this year and we haven’t done an actual wedding we got wedded by one person legally took a few pics and went home. I’m Ryland in this situation but also no one would come anyways it’d be so small
I LOVE YOU K BYE
Shane, you had me literally laughing out loud in the middle of the office. I love you! I'm so glad you're filming again!
Shane likes little kids and cats 🤢
Why are you still here
I still hope you get a yellow lambo someday Shane. You deserve good things. &  we’ve missed you here on YT. Hi from me & my pig Summer 🐖
i have nothing against him but is shane dawson not cancelled though
Stop being friends with jeffree and I can support
You shouldn't be here anymore. Jenna should have stayed and you, Jeff, and a load of others should have canceled yourself.
P is from a rapper gunna’s song called pushing p meaning you are pressure, you’re lit, cool whatever the sense is.
wasting my time commenting but this is fucking embarrassing
The mystery is solved in this video about how Chuck E. Cheese pizza is made https://youtu.be/tb9S9urKgDM
Please let me hang out with you & Ryland! 💀
🅿
I got a domino’s pizza ad while watching this. 👀
Shane blushing talking about TPE 😂
Omg I haven’t laughed so hard in so long. I love you so much and that you’re happy
https://youtu.be/h2gDhlnJD7c
I wonder if y'all go order a pizza a few minutes after they're open and if the pizza would look different . Hmmm...I'm gonna try this out lol. 😂
I would give anything to be invited to your wedding 😂!! get married already!!!
I'm living for the "TPE" merch lol :)
I have loved you since like 2013, you look amazing and so happy. Happy to see you ❤️
I love you Shane, really missed these
The entire common section is cap
Bro. You’ve been so chaotic in the best ways for years. But this video has a whole new amazing positive chaotic energy to it. I can’t stop laughing and I’m fucking living for it. We love you Shane!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
it could be them making two different types of pizza at the same time so if some orders half they just put the two half together and ofc ppl order sliced they probably just mix n match the ones they have in the back and not used ones
It started off with some bullshit
Love you daddy Shane and so proud of you for overcoming obstacles and returning, missed you and glad you're well. Stay positive. Xo
Happy to see him again
Omg I have MISSED Shane and ryland together like this so much
Yes our controversial black king is back 🙌 😍 👏
pleaseeee video record the podcast
Shane this video is not very good. You probably know that. I don't mean to offend you, just to give you feedback. I feel you're overdoing it with so many sound/music effect in between pauses to make your comments seem wholesome. It's obvios you're scared of people coming at you but honestly you just look desperate. Your content back then could have been problematic but for the good things you did it was actually better because you were unapologetically you.  Honestly if you're gonna make this crap content (no offense) at least make something where you don't have to apologize every two seconds.
Great to see that Roland still has no personality. And no. I’m not changing the auto correct name change.
I've been in a horrible mental place rn and seeing Shane back just makes me happy for the first time in a long long time...❣
No don't sell the house.. why?????
This man is a walking L, talkin bout smashing babys💀
OK, STOP PLAYIN AND ADRESS THE ALLEGATIONS AND EVIDENCE AGAINST U!
SHANE  MISSEE U SMMMMMMMM
Yes!  We are so glad you are back!  Me and my whole family watched this together, and laughed the Whole Time! I Loved the video, and all your wonderful craziness with your sweetheart Ryland and Christopher Robin. lol  I can't wait to see more, thank You!
THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK :(
Let's be clear, your words and actions 'ruined your life' not your podcast. I'm not a Shane hater, just to be clear, and I do hope to see growth and improvement in you.
Definitely made me wanna order a pizza now 😅😅
OMG OMG I’m so excited! How did I miss this video yesterday??? Oh well I get to watch it today…
Love you Shane
I missed you Shane. Hope you're doing better.
Literally all I’ve ever wanted is to just hangout with Shane and Ryland all the time and going on their little random adventures. Like if someone asked me to go to Chuck E. Cheese on a whim id be like duh obviously.
welcome back shane! ♥
Soooo happy your back, I love seeing you in Rylands videos and now this!!!! YAY! Nobody makes me LOL like you!!! :)
that video was so good, I loved it! I laughed so hard! we are all so happy to have you back, we love you!! 💗
I missed you and you're humor so soo much!!!! Glad to see you back 💜💜💜
I just realized Shane has put content out again. I've missed him!!!
We know what y’all have been enjoying in Colorado 🥬
Thank you for POSTING i missed you so much i’ve been watching you for so long i hope everything is better for you manifesting for you that everything goes well from here because you have truly been through hell and you still came back thank you for being so strong ❤️
😂
I LOVE YOU
Omg Shane!!! I have missed you so freaking much!! I'm so happy your back🥰🥰🥰
Please do a video where you guys go to Disney!!!!
I’ve been wondering why there has been Ps everywhere too!
No leave you are not a good person and you shouldn't have a platform like this
Why are there so many bots in these comments wtf. They all say the same thing. sus
Nasty
Yes!!! Shane, welcome back
I missed Shane and his jokes soo much! Also Chucke Cheese must be running out of money if they wanna sue Shane NOW for a video he did about them 3 YEARS AGO?! lmao They mad cus he's right. ALSO I really can't wait for you and Ryland to get married and its like you've already BEEN married cus you have been living like that so I don't think anything would change but it would still be so cute and inspiring to call each other husbands.
Pleaseeee make more mukbang videos I need someone to eat with PLEASE 😭🤣
I don’t think I can verbally describe just how happy it made me to watch this. Even if it was you guys just screwing around for 40 min, I haven’t laughed that hard in a long time and I missed that❤️ thank you for coming back Shane❤️
the comments makes me happy
So happy for u Shane and I am so looking forward to seeing what else you create
Well, this was a whole lot of nothing.
Please make a podcast 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰   Also what if the pizza crust just rips when it's baked? When you make a homemade crust sometimes it rips when making. If it's high schoolers working maybe they are still learning and it bakes off.     Or   What if they make it before hand like Costco and they just pick pieces and put it on a box.  That would make it a sanitary way of getting the pizzas in the videos
😘🥰 love ya Shane :-)
I'm 10 minutes in and dying laughing ahha
I’m so glad they went back to Chuck E Cheese, I was literally thinking about Shane’s old video about it like last week
He looks like Mr Beast.
happy to see u back <3
Can we get a video comparing chuckie cheese to other pizza places?????
Yes we made it
Shane is absolutely hilarious. He is always cracking me up 😂
The amount of times I almost spat my drink out throughout this video from laughing.. 🤣 I love your videos, please don't ever stop making them again!
I missed him
Glad you reminded me to unsub!
Never have laughed so much! So happy you’re back!
also why is everyone literally just lying in the comments?- LMAO
did everyone just forgot all the shitty actions he did????? he legit didn’t take accountability
omg i love this !
Have a small wedding then! Just go to Vegas, go to a chapel, done
Ok so the iconic jackets in the background in your beauty room. Why haven’t those been released I want the conspiracy bomber or the one with the space ships and aliens behind it omg I loveeeeee it!!!!   Thank you for making my day!!!!! I love it so much!!!! Yessssss to the podcast yesssss to TPE and Ryland you are such a remarkable human and sooooo amazing to be such a supportive and loving person who had stood by your man’s unrelenting I love you bothhhh with all my soul.
Leave again
Señor Pooh 😂😂😂😂
Ryland is trying so hard not to get a lawsuit LMAOO “I’ll eat this whole thing” 🥴🤨
I work at a pizza shop and the fact that they doc the pizza on the pizza screen is very weird to me and cutting pizza perfectly even slices is hard to do we had a customer call because they thought a piece was missing cuz the pizza moved during delivery
$80 on 3 large pies of pizza?! wtf?!
Tight P Energy omfg 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I've been waiting for the best podcast to listen to and yours will be PERFECT
The disclaimer had me rolling the whole way.
I love you!! ❤️
He is back
About the pizza thing lol not that many people leave their 1/2 uneaten 🍕 Or do they? I take left overs home they're expensive js 😏 good video Shane
Glad you're back
I just STILL hate ryland
Missed this!!! Can't wait for more
These videos feel like a parody of your old content 😴
I was the biggest fan of Shane’s old podcast so I can’t wait to listen to the new one!
https://youtu.be/onlRUpNpAok
Love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Happy to watch! Missed You
Im so happy for this
The homunculus argument (the little man inside your head controlling you) has been defunct by psychologists for decades. Who could possibly be controlling the little man inside your head? There would just be infinite tiny controllers.
well chucky cheese might not but ik some wendys get their food they threw away out the garbage, serve spoiled food to save money and etc..
Love Ryland  being slightly protective of his man
When i tell you this video made me SO FUCKING HAPPY….i love these types of videos of yours as well as the conspiracy videos. Do a combination of a bunch of diff videos including this!! I love the laughing and jokes!! So happy to see you filming and happy!!
I’m literally going to Chuck E. Cheese for my nephews birthday tonight. Lol love this. Thank you Shane!
Go to jail, nonce
So funny how there’s no negative comments they must be working hard to delete them all 😂
We needed this
Shane take a trip to Houston again for the livestock show and rodeo the carnival food is the best. They are going to have a flaming hot Cheetos float.
On tik tok they have those videos of behind the scenes franchises & they prepare food.. chuck e cheese employees needs to do one 😂
can i be invited to the wedding pls
Only 10 minutes in and it’s so problematic 😂
SHANE!! :DD
I know this would never happen, but like......Jess coming back for a new podcast. They've both been working on themselves and growing as people, it'd be so great to see them back together and brand new.
Alternate title: Crusty has-been makes shitty, boring vlog.
Shane is shameless, how can you still upland videos after being severely cancelled?
Chris Crumbl? Like Kris Kringel 🤔
Dying at “Señor Pooh” 😭💀
Damn i miss having friends this looks like fun
I haven't continuously smiled like that from a YT vid in so long! Glad you're getting back Shane!
wrong
I teach the truth about the Holy Bible on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/add/mttracks. Support your fellow Hebrew Israelite on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/mttracks?fan_landing=true -MTTRACKS
Shane literally go somewhere
Anyone else dying about their being an urgent care right behind Shane as he says he's not a doctor 😂
ew
so just have ryland get a sex change and it's all good
This is the Shane I miss. Just stay away from jeffree…
Literally my favorite person to watch on YouTube 💜 definitely happy to have you back Shane! Can’t wait to see what 2022 has in store for you!!
So happy your back ❤️❤️❤️you tube isn’t worth it with out your Shane ❤️
missed you shane!
I have to be honest it was absolutely wonderful to sit here and watch you guys like I used to a few years ago and before that when I just first started watching you in what 2010-11? It was nostalgic and it was very refreshing The Nostalgia is strong with this one young Padawan LOL
Nonce!!! I should NOT BE ALOUD TO HAVE ANIMALS😠😠😠😠
10:02 I CANT WITH THE IMMEDIATE “faggot” RESPONSE THAT WOULD BE ME💀😭
Hello Shane. Missed you
😂😂😂😂
does he say anything in this video? or is it all rambling nonsense nonstop?
OHH SO LIKE SO I MEANNNN SOOOO LIIIKKEE I MEEEEAN SOOO GAY YEAH THAT'S WHAT IT IS CUZ illuSOO GAYminate.......... ZIMUNDA ETER
Love this video, the best content happens when you don’t stress over it too much to make it perfect
Ryland is high key telling the people watching this to comment marry him now Shane!
Ummm f*** you YouTube for not giving me a notification about this video!  Me and my partner watched Shane for 5 years and now that I'm single I'm still gonna watch all theses! We need more!
I haven't heard the word "iconic" in years. 5 mins in...
So happy you're back Shane! 🤍
Pedophiles back again
I'm so happy you posted this video! I laughed and smiled so much that I forgot about this badass headache that I've had for days. I love love love your sense of humour Shane 🤗 Keep these videos coming! All the best to you, Ryland and your families! Hugs from Romania ❤️
shane can you sponser us plz~love jamba juice
🅿️
They sell there pizzas at the grocery store frozen section now and my aunt legit went oh yum peoples leftovers and I SCREECHED 😭😭😭🤣
Can I just say I’m happy that you’ve stopped talking shit on yourself mostly! You seem so much happier.
love
Matpat from food theory did this while covid had all the restaurants closed for dining in and they still looked like this lol
disgusting
love u so much nonce <3 😍💕
why are u back? literally ur a weirdo and ur fan base is too for condoning what u did and allowing u back
I’m guessing filtered comments
you're still cancelled
My guy got painfully unfunny I can’t watch anymore 😭
the jealousy Ryland is putting out is hilarious
Ok I just have the say this real quick because I miss my grandpa so much and his favorite Disney character was Winnie the Pooh and so that really touched my heart when you brought it up. But then the one with the mariachi hat..my grandpa sang mariachi and we got his favorite mariachi singer too play at the last birthday party he had. So thank you, like I know you had no idea and don’t know me but I feel like I got to see a glimpse of him today!
It's great to see you back Shane. I was crying from laughing so hard. But boy marry Ryland already! He's working so hard eating that pizza & "loving it" to not get you sued by Chuck E Cheeses!
i was laughing the whole video through the end always therapeutic
im sorry...are we just ignoring all the predatory remarks hes made towards children...? And the way he treated all his friends...? This is why social media is fcked, everybody has lost their morals and no longer cares who these creators are in real life. If you support him, you are a part of the problem. Hes manipulative, he gaslights everybody including his fans and hes been EXTREMELY creepy towards children. bUT pEOpLE ChaNGE RigHt?? 🙄 once a creep, always a creep
But did u know that domino's and pizza hut have frozen dough. I've never tried to make my own pizza but that could possibly be it. The frozen dough helps keep the perfect circle also I belive they use a pan to keep the perfect circle shape
0:00 No we don't want it.
I really liked this one, it was an Old Shane mixed with new Shane, mixed with new ryland mixed with #Ryan. Also I hope that Chris is getting paid splendidly for doing the pod and doing this (not to mention the two hour drive to cookie crumble.)  congrats to Chris! (you'll find love again)
you should definitely make a apple podcast! it'd be worth the listen :)!!
I can’t tell if Shane is actually serious or not when he believes these simulation conspiracies. Like he acts so clueless and naive to things as a 34 year old man. Like clearly you’re not being controlled like the sims lmao
Best starting intro..I know some people were mind blown ,but it may just be true.When we die we may all just wake up somewhere else and this life we are in was just some sort of game and then we will resume our other lives before we stepped into this universe. I just hope we can locate everyone we me in this life outside in our life before this one...then again if your dead and they our still alive ,I'm guessing you have to wait until they die so you can see them again. My first question would be "how did you die/pass?"
$80 for Up Chuck Cheese Pizza ??? 😱
Then why can’t I change my avatar? I wanna change my avatar.
Why Did I Divorce my RUSSIAN WIFE??? https://youtu.be/Djoe1CyaqiE
Still canceled
I’m glad you’re doing so well, Shane!! You guys and Christopher Robin back all together on-screen was a good surprise to wake up to yesterday. 😊💙 My DEBUNKING THEORY as to why the pizzas are always crooked and weird looking is because IF they really do make and shape the dough in-kitchen, they might not always shape them into perfect circles since I imagine they’re cooking a lot at a really fast pace. (But no, real talk, they’re recycled, lmao.)
Nope.
Happy you’re back💚
Shane I love love love you and am so happy your back. I watched ryland blogs to see you. I just feel it’s really hard for ryland to step back and let you do you. He choose you to film with him but hopefully we’ll see more and not equal of you Shane. I’m here for you Shane.
lmao comment buyer
I died laughing at the shark tank idea and I loooove the shirt idea T.P.E!!!!!
Pushin’ P by Gunna lmao
Yes!!! ❤❤❤
i can see you walking on eggshells w every single thing you say, it shouldn't be like that. if people don't believe in growth or change then what's the point of anything ya know
Realised how everything they  talk about is mostly p !  Pushing P, pussy, pizza
welcome back shane! im glad your back :)
Really missed watching your videos. Don't let other people stop u from what u love doing.  P.S. LOVED THE VIDEO. keep it up :)
I’ve missed you!!!!!!
i love seeing you post shane. i love you regardless. i know you are good and don’t mean harm to anyone
let's take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into the  content for us ngl...
Funny how when he does come back nothing has changed about him at all and is continuing to talk about women like he did 10 years ago about a little girl. But it’s 2022 right 🤷🏼‍♀️
No one is going to forget what you have done
Legit DIED the entire time!!!
Thw queen arrives for us in his truck. UGH I LOVE YOU SHANE. :))
these high-profile youtubers are so f---- weird
<3
It was all very random, but it will nice to see you again. YouTube has missed you.
I won’t watch Jeffery star anymore but I love me some Shane Dawson and Ryland. HURRY UP AND GET MARRIED SHANE..   it makes it look like Ryland is head over heels for u & ur just not sure.... but Ryland can defend himself what do I know ❤️❤️
Yaaaaaaaassssss! Finally😍🙏🖤
shane dawson is my intrusive thoughs as a person/neg
missed u shane
I’m sure they have pizzas premade to take individual slices from when ppl don’t want a whole pie and then they just fill the gaps to sell the whole pizza. Very cheap move that avoids food waste
Shane maybe you shouldn’t get sued next time
"when i hear a voice in my head telling me dont go here and do this and that is that the player telling me that" no your just a schizophrenic
It's an embarrassment to have you in Colorado please leave.
Whoever is still mad at him being back, despite apologies and working on himself, take a loot in a mirror. Everyone fucked up in their lives, everyone hurt someone. Wonder how many of you apologised for it.
i cannot believe how easily everyone excuses pedophilia
god you also made my life ass for a week when you dropped a conspiracy about Hollister. They made us talk to every employee about your video. Lowkey so dumb
I didnt realized how much I missed your videos like this. U seemed happier. I'm glad to see u back at it again. 😘
It’s chuckie cheese didn’t hate you guys it would be cool for them to let you do a documentary of behind the scenes and let you make pizza with them and also dress up like chuckie lol
LETS GOOO SHANE your so cool
i loveee you
Before you know, you don't know!!!! DO IT.
SHANE DAWSON WAS MEANT FOR THIS SHIT. THE FACT THAT HES SO CONTROVERSIAL MAKES HIM EVEN BETTER AT IT
i'm glad you're back! haters incoming:
So happy your back!! Would love to see this podcast, a deepdive into conspiracy theories hosted by you would be amazing ❤❤
I will take any Shane Dawson content 😌
girl why are you back
RYLAND DESERVES BEEETTTTTTTTTTTEEERRRRRRRRRR
Please go away shane, get off the internet
I’ve already watched this one several times lol clicked so fast when it uploaded 😆😍💕
smiled throughout the whole video, you guys are too funny. love you shane!!
I laughed out loud for a good 12 mins. Shane this was hilarious please keep making videos!
Shane is literally me when I make my boyfriend call in orders too! 😆🤣
SHANE!!!!! <3
I’m so happy that Shane has come back. I hope it inspires other Youtubers who have left to come back as well
i love him so much i’ve supported him through all this he had to go through!
i need that podcast actually 🤣🤣
yay
Honestly love random talking videos like this. Had me cracking up. Living for it. ❤
I love their pizza 🤷‍♀️. Taking my 4 year old there today.
Hey rylands onto something small wedding with barely anyone are the way to go!
Shane Dawson tries crazy edible ASMR food.
🅿️ means good
I don't think it's a coincidence there was an urgent care also in the Chuck E. Cheese parking lot 😂😂😂  Shane, I loved this!! I literally laughed out loud the entire time. Thank you for coming back for us ❤️❤️❤️
me : checks if shane post everyday                                                                                                                                                                           shane: post                                                                                                                                                                                                                             me : runs around the room screaming
As someone who has depression i also didn't think I'd be here in 2022, i felt like that up until the beginning of last year. I'm now living my best life, getting the support i need and appreciating the things I have in my life.  For anyone going through the lows, you will get there and you will be able to live and not just exist ❤
WE NEEEEEEED A NEW SHANE PODCAST!!!!!!! IM LIVINGGGGG FOR IT!!‼️‼️‼️
11 minutes in and my face already hurts from laughing 🤣🤣🤣❤️ this is why I love you and I’m so glad you’re back
love that you’re back but the “awww poor me I was canceled :/“ jokes aren’t funny, just sad and out of touch
ugh I love seeing shane so happy  :') <3
Day 22 of commenting till I'm at 300 subs
are we really JUST NOW googling how Chuck E. Cheese makes their pizza?
This is so embarrassing for him
Nobody: Shane: We ArE BaCk In La BaBy!!! 🥴
actually Ukraine it's joke!  listening to u destroy themself nuclear weapons!  now want u shit weapons help! get your weapons debts!  use Ukraine people money pay back your weapons debt!
I'm so glad you're back 😊
Narcissistic homosexual.   Made it 4 minutes into this video.   Adios
Shane's new cameraman Chris, is hot.
you have to call him CHRIS CRUMBL!
I LOVE YOU
Shane you are funny
Does anyone know what the 🅿️ means!?
Joking about being cancelled is a very quick way to showcase you learned nothing from being "cancelled" but I guess he doesn't need to when, judging by the comments, nobody seems to care. Rich problematic yt's continuing to thrive. Hate to see it.
Shane clairvoyant yesss and talking about spirits 😁 me too! Call me ☺️ jp! Not really 😂
“made me republican” nahahahaaga
You want Ukraine to fight Russia! Why let Ukraine destroy nuclear weapons? Ukraine's original nuclear weapons are enough to confront Russia and do not need your weapons assistance at all!
roll call to see who disliked the video since we can’t see it
Why do you have a lisp?  Did you get punched in the mouth or are you doing it on purpose?
Missed you 😘 💕 💓 ❤!!!
Ok Shane is actually hilarious 😂😂😂
it blows my mind that he can have so many clearly inappropriate scandals with and regarding minors and then come back to do some random conspiracy video like everything's fine. and people will still watch and give him the views and ad revenue for it. It's so gross. he wasn't cancelled. he was exposed as an absolutely creepy man who should never be alone with minors. why does everyone keep forgetting that?
Shane u should go to the clown motel In tonopah Nevada there’s a cemetery nxt door
You are definitely deleting comments. And honestly might be paying for positive ones. They all sound exactly the same.
YES!! I wish you’d post more often lol
Why wasnt this in my recommendations sooner??...notifications will be on!
I LOVED THIS…..this honestly made my whole year so far.
I worked in a resort where they did that with the morning crumb cake. We had to bring the leftovers back to the kitchen and they would dump it back in the pan and send it back out so there is enough for everyone. The servers would talk so much shit about it but never to the managers face because we wanted to keep our jobs. But now that I dont work there anymore and am no longer a teenager Im like holy shit i can’t believe that was actually a thing and if they did it…you never really know what other businesses would
If your watching this video you get it! Yes
I love you Shane x
Loved the video Shane!
Yes you're right this isn't what we wanted... Just stay off the internet please!!!
🖤
Shane a few years ago: gets in a lawsuit with chuckycheese talking about reusing pizza Shane this year: going back to chickycheese to see if they learn their lesson
Not buying the "cutter" excuse, I briefly worked on a pizzeria once and never saw a pizza that looked like those!  Even if is half cheese and the other half something else, you can do it all in one since they are made from scratch! When you are cutting all the pieces would fit... Those pizzas still look delicious to me even with all the controversy 😂
Awe I love how much personality is in this video:))
fraudulent
I don’t care I’m so happy ur back! Literally smiling through this whole video
The fact that urgent care is in the background when reviewing the pizza made it even funnier !!! 😂
Went there for a kids party and the pizza tasted fine it was just super greasy and made me sick.
“I mean.. it ruined my life” 😂😂 I love you Shane do the podcasts pleaseeee
i’ve never laughed so hard in so long, i’ve missed you shane! ❤️
I was crying at some points with laughter. Ahhh our Shane’s back!
Check the bottom of the pizza
Colorado has been the best thing for shane. its amazing seeing the change..
Ryland is really the embodiment of gay, never seen someone be/look so gay in everything they do. He literally oozes out being gay lmao

His back ❤️ always be yourself Shane we love u that way
Ryland: “Let’s get you in that suit..” *stares off in the distance* 😂
so glad u r back....love uuuu Shaneee :))
Someone might have mentioned this already but my theory (at least for the 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas) is that they just make a full size for a cheese and a full size for whatever topping and then just put two halves together. The ones that are 1/2 and 1/2 look the most wonky and that’s the only way I could make sense of it
I am LAUGHING so hard I love it!!!!! Nobody else compares!! 😂😂😂🥰🥰
I literally laughed out loud so many times. Excited to see you’re back!
16:00 you sure she just didnt follow you on twitter
shane you deleting comments?
nope go back
Podcast with Morgan!!!!
Stop touching cats
Yes  !!!!!
Love watching any content Shane puts out ❤️ helped me live through my depression since middle school with Shananay. And won’t ever stop watching him.
“Here’s something you don’t want” gosh Shane I’ve always loved you. You never fail to make me smile ever.
Chuck E Cheese can only be mad at themselves  the fact that their pizza looks so bad people could actually believe it’s old pizza being reserved.
Stop
I've missed your content so much! Thank you for the laughs Shane as always!!
Sex is a Low Vibration Act Fullfillness comes from Inside you. YOU ARE A attention WORE
BEFORE YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW!
"I know this is probably not what you want" , you're damn right we want you to go to fucking prison mate.
Please do not ever come into my recommended EVER again. I unsubscribed from you for a reason.
Isn't this the third time youre bringing up Chuck E Cheese in a conspiracy video? NEXT.
i think you just need to be the new face for chuck E cheese
So glad to see this. I laughed so much. I have missed you and your crazy sense of humor. Thank you for surviving people who tried to cancel you. You should interview Jenna Marbles. I miss her also.
I have been patiently waiting for your videos to come back - 2022 is your year! I have not laughed at a video this hard in a long time :)
Yes! Finally we get to see your brother again! I love his YouTube channel until it got taken over by the other guy. Please can you tell us what happened?!?! I love his conspiracy theory videos!
oh to be Shane's cameraman😭😭😭
Nothing like 3 gay guys talking about v*ginas 😂😂
Hear me out, a full makeover video, stylist specific, someone who takes your measurements and provides a whole wardrobe for you based on your taste, lounge wear, filming/going out everything, We would love to watch that!
For as much as ryland has gone through with Shane, you would think Shane would act like he actually loves him
Shane literally no one wants you back, the internet was great without you!
8:55 the best part of the video so far hahahahahah
If you want to raise awareness for teens in foster care please reach out. I adopted my daughter and when she was an adult ❤️
THIS WAS THE VIDEO I NEEDED TO SEE LOL, Love It x
I actually love their pizza it’s really good
Maybe this year isn't going to be so bad after all. I wasn't expecting to see you pop up but WOW am I glad you're back 😭😭
Your whole brand is being a gross person but somehow a pretty normal looking pizza makes you uneasy.
no matter wat hqppend his still getting views and trending. hes content is actually entertaing. i hope he continues to post more.
We need an old rachet food video🤣 just one more🤣
I dislike you immensely and I hate that you're back.
Maybe you should try different foods or smack from different countries !
Shane, I have missed you! You never fail to make me smile! Keep being your wonderful self!♥️
nawh.
BOOOO TOMATO TOMATO
Funny video but my only issue is why was it $80 for three boxes of pizza???
“We made it, Chuckie” 😭😭 im dying!
Am I the only one who's always watching Shane's (and Ryland's) videos several times in a row? It just makes me so happy! :)
😂🤣 such a joy to have u back
Thank you so much for coming back I really missed you you really help me go through my depression back in high school thanks for being you and I hope sometime in the future you and I can meet up I know that’s a longshot though
I'm excited to see you're back 🥺 can't wait to see what you'll bring us 💗
Omg I missed Shane.
These pizza sizes are pretty sus..surely, one time the pizzas have gotta be fresh? How early do you need to get there to get one? This is the real pizza gate surely?
why is the camera guy laughing like he heard the most funniest thing in the world every 10 seconds? Nothing Shane said is funny!
I love seeing you getting excited to make new videos 🤩🙂
do a coronavirus conspiracy theories
I think I speak for everyone here in the comments when I say, we are all glad to have you back and we all missed you
Ugh this video made me so happy
Godfirst #whospink? MadeULook #6g
80 DOLLARS!?!?
Do a podcast !!!! Do it!!!!!
This was pretty fkn funny and I'm actually glad you have the creative juices flowing were even more honest and raunchy in this video hehe. When it comes to the pizza one motto to have is just "let the mystery be." <3
So happy to see this on my feed 👌🏻😂
I’m so glad your back!! ❤️
I’m not going to lie, I haven’t laughed that hard from a YouTube video in a long time. Thank you Shane, welcome back!
I seriously need at least 3 episodes a week on your podcast
😂I dont know what I expected but im so glad its not another dramatic video, altough ur conspiracy video looks good this type of entertainment is a fresh breathe of air. Thank u for the years of laughter Shane
Shane will always be my favorite youtuber idc how many times people cancel him😂 so happy he came back
You should have asked them to not cut it beforehand
I saw Honey and I completely forgot they had dogs so my first thought was "Holy crap its a wolf!?!?" Then I was like....I'm a dumbass
LOVEEE YOU SHANE!!! YOU ARE AMAZING 🥰💟💟💟💟💟💟💟
10:02 I died 😂😂😂
Yes yes yes it’s about fucking time...... welcome back Shane ❤️
Unless they're cutting that pizza with a machete, that explanation doesn't make sense 😂
you are the worlds antidepressants
i'm guessing all the pizza slices are different because people have 1 half with different toppings on sometime so the other half of that pizza stays somewhere keeping warm until someone else orders that side of topping and eventually you'll end up with all different slices getting mixed up somewhere, if there is somewhere they keep the slices for the next person? hopefully not the slices off a customers left overs though. It does look tasty, wish i could try a slice.
Everything Jared said made me feel so uncomfortable 🥴😂 still can’t wait to watch
We all needed this, we love you Shane keen on the podcast 💖
Glad to see you back papi
Who the hell is that scrooge of a "you" you keep referring to. I very much wanted to and loved listening to this.
The pizza was crazy lol
Been a while since we got new content! Whatcha selling this time!?
YES please start a podcast.  i loved shane and friends podcast. bring jessie back. i miss her too
There has To have been hundreds of not thousands of Karen mommies come back and say “this isn’t fresh pizza! These aren’t even, looks like you put random pizza parts with the other slices! I want a refund! You think I’m stupid to notice these don’t go together?!!!”
🥰🤩 I love this!🤣
I’m glad you realized your mistakes though cause everyone makes jokes and don’t realize
I just know hes gonna get sued but im here for it
Shane, you need to undercover BOSS that shit and get them to let you into that kitchen to see whats going on!!! Those cuts dont line up and I NEED to know what kind of janky ass slicer they are using! Glad you're back BB
🅿️
I love your conspiracy videos but dorky videos like this are my favorite and I'm so happy you made a new one😭
How I missed your videos! It had me smiling and laughing all the way through :)
PODCAST!!?? Is my dream gonna come true?? 😭❤️ I love you always Shane!
This video is what I needed. I love you shane❤️
Never Forgetti The Freak You Are Shanerino
Camera man needs to stop laughing
L bozo
You should go back to Chucky when they are fully open with people inside and then do a pizza review. I also think the pizza is Frozen so that's why it looks jumbled when you order half and half. They take half a pepperoni and half a cheese and slap them together. I suppose to a pizza restaurant that loads everything up on one pizza and then puts it in the oven
missed u SO much<33
wtf
it’s the chuck e. cheese disclaimers for me
I’m skipping this 🅿️ trend
Missed you!
Today’s serotonin maxed out from this funny video lol
I don't care what anyone says. I have missed you so much. You have always been one of my favorite YouTubers and will continue to be one of my favorite YouTubers. I really hope you do more conspiracy videos by the way
Sooo glad your back ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Food theory debunked the pizza theory
Beach wedding, no suits.
Most of the views are coming from fake mr beast accounts lmao
Omg my name is Krissy so I felt like you were saying hi to me hahah
Eurgh the beginning is ALWAYS a waste of time.
Damn! 80$ for 3 pizzas w. Cheese& pep, not even all pep!! WTAF😵 yall shouldn’t have gone back to LA!That CANNOT BE RIGHT!😳🤬🤣 also, ya should have gave it to some homeless.. god knows there’s enough in ur area. Much love yall
I missed you Shane! I have been watching you since 2009. And I am getting a very different vibe from you in this video, seems there's more positive energy from you here.   I hope you have been well and look after yourself aways!
A PODCAST?!! omg ive got really into podcasts lately so i’m so excited
We love whatever content you want to create because we love you.
It scares me how people forgive paedophiles these days the future seems dark
Ryland looks ROUGH what happened
IM SOOOOOO GLAD YOU ARE BACK SHANE .YOU HAVE BEEN MISSED
I told y’all his brother was a conspiracy theorist
Great to see you back on YouTube :). My wife and I watch you and Ryland and enjoy your videos.
SHANE DAWSON'S CREEK...... This is exactly what we wanted cant wait for the next video.  Here is one from my gang its old but maybe it'll make someone 😅 MICHAEL MCDONALD PARODY https://youtu.be/-PZmXA60aag
Still trending!!! 24 hours trending!!! I leave it playing on repeat on my TV 😜💜
Nooo this has me cracking up the whole time lol
I'm surprised Shane hasent taken up a new job as a priest that would be such a good job for him!!
I’ve tried to watch this like ten times but I fall asleep within minutes 🙈
I loved this!  Shane is hysterical and I’m so glad he’s back!
Just read Manufacturing Consent, Hegemony or Survival, Necessary Illusions and the books they reference, and shut up.
Welcome back Shane!! 🥰
I meann... you're 3rd on tRENDINGGGG
Can you order a pizza and ask for it not to be cut up. Then you’ll get your real answer
LMFAOOOOOOO love that you're back shane <3

I already died laughing in the first 5 minutes
Shane you are still so funny and are perfect just the way you are.
I CANNOT wait for this podcast Shane!
I like how much more aware of yourself and more genuine you’re being now. Through all the pain you’ve went through,  it shows you’ve done/ are doing the healing work. 💗

MOREEEE QUANTITY OVER QUALITY FOR US TBHHH GIVE US MOREEE SHANEEEEEEE
Please do a conspiracy on Meta!!!
I’ve had physic things happen to me over the yrs. I’m a Pisces & also jus had such a complicated life..I really wish I was able to tap into it more! It happens randomly but I wish I had more control. Shane♥️ I have to say how much you’ve helped me & so many others! The suicide thing hit home & I really wish I could talk to a physic that’s ligit! I’ve always wanted to meet w. A medium privately but hasn’t happend. Much love to u & everything you’ve done, goin to do & all ur endeavors! I believe so much in ya honey! Much love ❤️🥰✌🏼✌🏼💖👑💖
Needed that ! So happy you're back, love you 💜💜💜 I also can't wait for new conspiracy theories Edit: 43 minutes have never gone by so quick
Please tell me Jared isn't serious hahahaha
Wow, didn’t know he was bi, always thought he was gay. Ngl, I am oddly happy for him in that regard 😸
Damn I missed these SO much! Ur prob the only person on here that’s actually made me LOL literally! & ive always related to ya so much. Its cray how I’ve had visions that come to be real, I recently felt the need to call my mom & warn her 1day cuz I had vision of an accident on a well known rd where I grew up. She didn’t go to work the next day cuz my gmas cane fell down In Front of her also & she didn’t really have to go that day + she was freaked out! That afternoon, there was a tractor trailer accident on that rd where she would have traveled 😵
9:12 LOL Shane just snorted downstairs 6:45 when he laughed… I love when he does that…
Omg I have to go.. I live in Bethlehem I’m going to go soon for sure 😍
Conspiracy videos are my fav
I am so happy you are back Shane! :) - My lonely days are over XD
Every Video you do is making my day! Don‘t pressure yourself
The chuck e cheese stuff I can’t 😭😂😂
This is exactly what I wanted tbh. To just see how you're doing, listening to you talk about how you've been, going on a small adventure and laughing together. I miss your jokes. Thanks Shane! Welcome back :)
Fark the haters I’m just glad your back, your amazing and just because your seen by the public doesn’t mean they have to weirdly idolise you and put you down for being human and growing ! We all are here for you block the haters out !! COME BACK🥺
we need more conspiracy theory videos
I freaking LOVE Shane! 1:11 I’m dying
this video was so chaotic I CANT. im so glad ur back shane tho, ngl i missed ur videos
I think  you should script your content to avoid you know what I mean 😉
oh boy oh boy, if this is how you try to NOT GET SUED .... ROFL you're crazy, always have been, you just evolved your ways.  the podcast could be great! i'm excited for it. just please be mindful and careful what you put out there, because as we both know, those clips will be dug up in 15 years....
The banter between Ryland, Shane, and Shane is hilarious!!!
Daily blogs from Shane yessss👏👏👏 seeing Shane happy makes my happy I’m proud of you Shane ❤️❤️❤️
GOD I missed Shane
Shane you need to order a pizza and ask them not to cut it!  This will definitely debunk it!!
I'm so happy for you! I see a change in you. I've had something similar. Ppl who have dealt with pain sometimes have dark humor but I see a happiness in yours now. I think getting rid of toxic ppl has helped you grow! Love you ❤️ I already watched this several times
🤍
I really enjoyed this video - thank you for sharing 🥰
Jamie Lynn 😂 😝  Great to see you smiling and happy ❤️💜🌈
“The lawsuit of Shane Dawson” ..: “I had a dream that ryland had a vagina”  I’m crying 😭😂😂
https://youtu.be/SydS6x3Kq9Y
https://youtu.be/SydS6x3Kq9Y
Why don't you try, doing a round pizza, cut it on a different cutting board into slices and then lift the slices onto the cardboard box or on a plate and organise them .. dunt think it's that simple tbh... Bc pizza's not totally solid, the slices won't go perfectly next to each other. Sounds perfectly logical to my weird Finnish mind. EDIT: Omg, I shoulda looked and not mostly just listen to you guys.. so I'd seen the trillion Disclaimers 😆 Good to see you making videos again Shane!
i've never heard of a spirit guide being same sex before.
nope
I'm at 7 minutes and it already is the funniest vid ever xD
i love youu <3
Okay I’m gagging. I loved this video. This is the content I’ve needed!
how much u get paied to come back shane lol gg on making it back in the hollywoods
Omg I waited so long for this moment😍 It's so good to have you back❤️
i turned this off within 1'13" (1 min 13 sec) because i saw shane was still unable to understand others POV. tbh as a youtuber in this time and age its important to take a stand.and also be able to listen. ive been an avid viewer for a while, this video takes my ability to see a second chance in someone and relinquish it. please shane, recognize the people who are putting other adults at risk, not to mention the large number of underage followers you profit off of. i get that you can profit from viewership.... but what is your purpose, what do YOU want to say.
This is exactly what I like to see 😁 you look so incredibly happy ✨
I missed this type of content SO MUCH
Omg, Chris! I used to watch him and his friend on YouTube way back. Glad to see your back!
To be honest, I just miss the old conspiracy days. I actually did miss ya Shane
Am I the only one that thought it was O'Reillys? Auto parts?
Lol that’s not what p mean
Yh
I will forever be a Shane fan, anyone who judges him for making outta pocket jokes are hypocrites bc I bet they’ve said worse, I love you Shane 😌
You gotta keep that tracksuit!!! It looks boss!
I Wanna know what's on sale 🤔 👀
I feel so bad for Ryland honestly he deserves to be treated better
About time you came back,love the conspiracy videos ,much love from Australia.🦘❤
this was great 😂 love you Shane hope the great energy and videos continue ❤️
Bro have you ever tried cutting a pizza that shit does not stay close together
This video was chaotic and I love it
holy shit, new vid lets go
i havent laughed this hard in such a long time
Why was all the noises while Ryland was trying to make the phone call SO IRRITATING to me
I cannot wait for the Shane Dawson podcast!!!! It makes my entire day everytime you make a new video! So glad you're back
honestly bc of my anxiety i couldn't watch your previous one ;d but videos like this are fine and make my mood better <3 love u
Shane!!! We have missed you, idk if I was just really high but I couldn’t stop laughing throughout this whole video. I love this type of content from you, keep it up :) I remember listening to your podcast years ago! I never thought I’d hear you say you were going to do it again, but I’m all here for it!! Cannot wait for the pod!
I couldn’t stop laughing throughout the video, rewatching for the fun of it now 😭😭
I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time😂😂😂
&& YES! It's crazy about you having sex with a woman....nope. you cant. Unless it's Ry Ry.
my pizza theory : they never make the dough into a circle, if its by hand they dont have flatteners like other larger pizza chains that make it a perfect circle. they just have employs that dont pay attention to the shape and so its all lop sided lmao
You ARE a MAN. ish.
Welcome back ❤️💋
Tbh I would love a podcast from you Shane. I literally was laughing this whole video. I know you love creating the big projects but maybe a podcast could be something you do more regularly, could even post them on Pateron with how many views you get you would make good money per video and not even have to spend on brand partnerships. Honestly my favorite episodes of rylands podcast are the ones with you cause you bring so much to them in your humor and outlook. Ryland’s vlogs are so fun cause of your dynamic and humor. Just in your editing I was dying at the part where you guys gambled and were having trouble figuring out how much you won. So anyways just want to encourage you to keep going after your ideas and know you still have people who care about you and enjoy your content.
I’m just so glad your back! I missed youuu🥰 keep making videos, I don’t care if it’s conspiracy or not we just want to see you:))
I am slowly dying of cancer and im very hurt. This is cool though
Thanks for the laughs.
Lol I love it! But for all the ones who think it's real ,.....it's handmade dough so it's not perfectly commercial.
Idc what people say I’m so fuckin happy you’re back!
Love him or Hate him, Shane Dawson always drops bangers. NO CAP!
I love these vlogs.♥️
It was like u were asking for the law suit
😂😂😂
I laughed so hard watching this.  Thank you Shane!
The 2022 bit, I get it
I always knew you would make a come back. So, welcome back Good Sir 😎
I kinda feel a lil sad. There was awkward energy and I felt like Ryland was being made fun of in someway. I love you, but I couldn't watch it all. 💗💗
Lol are you kidding?  Shane snorted soo many time in this video! He does it so often you don’t even realize it lol
I’ll keep saying this but my biggest flex in life is I never stoped supporting Shane I went as far as to send him msgs letting him know he still had fans and we loved and wanted him back.,,. Every upload from him I smile and say thank god!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ love you Shane
I love you 😭🖤 I haven’t genuinely laughed or got on YouTube to watch actual videos in a while!! Missed you🥺🖤
I haven’t laughed this hard in a while, thankyou
I feel like I’ve reconnected with my toxic ex but I shouldn’t but I have ❤️😂
Thank you for still being here shane
i love how happy you are again. i missed your videos a lot.
SÈNOR POOH IM SCREAMING
Shane gets another lawsuit letter in the mail..
The camera person. They are standing in the way of a much better comeback.
Guys why do I low key understand Ryland’s worry about Shane tho..lol same sis
Thank you for coming back !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and i have ad blocker ;)
I missed you both so much! ❤️💛
I laughed so much, needed that...
THE QUEEN IS BACKKKKK!!!!

Also if your really selling your house  wyd with the bean bag😂😂😂 can I buy it from you?  😂 Jk 👀
Wow thank you Shane I'm really enjoy it . I wish you the bests . please make more video like this.
I missed you Shane!
After watching Shane for years it’s amazing to finally see him happy like he deserves! So proud of you Shane, I love the content, can’t wait for conspiracies!
It’s good to see Shane being happy like in his older videos. I laughed throughout the video.😂
Ok but why a grand canyon university ad !?😂😂😂💜
Conspiracy bullshit. What’s new
Lmao the disclaimer is scary
Love you Shane!! Pulling up in a truck like a real cowboy man haha
I don't think Chuck E. Cheese serves the leftover pizza of other customers but they do sell pizza by the slice as well as pizza by the pie... so maybe they just add the pizza they sell by the slice together with the pizza by the pie and that's why it ends up looking weird?
This was delightful and real. Glad to see you again.
Not me getting super stoned right before putting this on and the first thing spoke about is how we are living in a simulation and then Shane’s like you know when you wake up from your dream but you’re still dreaming but you’re not still dreaming also ryland has a vagina.   I can’t comprehend, I’m not even 5 minutes in 😂😂
Shane, istg I started crying from happiness when I saw that u finally posted again, I missed u so much.
Comparing his body to chucky cheese pizza has been the most relatable I’ve ever felt😂😭😭😭
maybe they cut it before they bake it??:D
I feel like.. by them wanting to take that whole thing to court... makes them look more ridiculous. Especially since it probably brought them business if anything. As the CEOs or.. whatever the hell types of people own Chuck E Cheese... I would be like "Whatever. Free advertisement."
this was sooooo funny
Shane I love you. So good to see you. Please make videos on the regular. I also wait for your videos.
I love your videos!  Your the best!
Literally smiled and laughed this ENTIRE TIME. I’ve missed youuuuuuu
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
love how there is a urgent care behind the chuck e. cheese…
Could the worker meant they remove all the pieces onto the cutting board and then put them in the box so some pieces aren’t in the right order.?
I love you and I’ve missed you!!!
ohh beastiality guy is back
pushing 🅿️
I have the exact same Face shield!
SHANE I missed your videos so much!!!  Please make a podcast I would listen every single episode!!!!❤️❤️❤️ I know they would be so interesting.  I’d honestly listen to you talk about anything though.
this was sooo funny!!! I love Chris!!! and Ryland makes the video so much funnier!! lmfao
leave youtube
What happened to andree
So like…I was definitely paying for whatever app Shane’s old podcast was on. And I don’t ever remember cancelling it…Did it just disappear?! Have I been paying for it this whole time?! 😂😅
Did Ryland get veneers? His mouth is moves weird. His teeth are white and the front two are not crooked anymore.
Why is my player filled with so much bs anxiety then
It’s… THE BEANS✨
I think the pizza is like that because they sell individual pizza slices & what is left from the pizza they put them all together so they won’t waste; and the half & half pizza I believe it is cut from another pizza then they just attached it together; I don’t think they make the pizza from scratch. They probably attach what they have together to create a customers order. Idk though but I don’t think it comes from the trash
I love watching you guys! Thanks for uploading Shane!!
How can you stand your own content?
so i guess shane and jeffree arent friends anymore. I wonder why hahahaha
I love your videos so much make moorrrrreee I miss you
Fire I would eat it
What is this video? 😂
I really needed this video 💜
You said we probably didn’t want this, but we DID. This is the funniest video I’ve watched on YouTube in MONTHS. Also, tight pu$$y energy is my new phrase because that is everything! I’m so glad you’re back! 🤣😍🤣😍
❤
So grateful to see you doing the things that make you happy always be you Shane ❤️🥀
See, now this clickbait crap is what turned people against you in the first place Shane. Learn you bloody lesson 🙄
Zoophiles and pedophiles should stay off the internet
15 minutes in and we’re still talking about rylands vagina 😂😂😂😂
I haven’t laughed like this In so long!! I miss you sooo much
Omg u had me Cracking up u need come back on YouTube ur to damm funny
The world does NOT need another conspiracy video Shane.
I missed you! I was literally smiling and laughing through the entire video. You and Ryland are literally everything! Love you guys 🥰
Yessss food videos!!!!!
So ridiculous❤️ love it
one time i came home w a 104 degree fever from chuckey cheese and went to the ER
You know how a hot bagel is all warm and delish but once it gets cold it kinda becomes a different bagel as far as texture. This can’t be just me. With this theory maybe CC cuts the pizza so hot that when it cools down to just regular hot it kinda shrinks and makes it look like it’s pulling away from the pieces. Throw in that weird comment on the employees not knowing how to use the cutter and you get weird jacked looking pizza. Thoughts?
“If you’re watching this video… you get it” HAHA god dammit. The OG subs feel the same way, fam. We made it. (for now lol)
I used to watch you in middle school , I'm ashamed of that cause that's super fucking cringe. Shane with all sincerity from a man who grew up watching you, DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT.  Eventually the youtube money will dry up, Ryland is kinda boring and his main trait is being your husband. So we both know the money's definitely going to dry up eventually. Anyway, work on the racism and too edgy jokes, maybe you can have some kind of redemption arch IDK. My guy I'm more disappointed than I am angry (not by much but still) you could have done anything to demonstrate personal growth. Then we get these videos that almost have no mention of any wrong doings. I know repeating yourself is annoying but, my god just disappearing and coming back was the worst way to do this. Donate to a charity, do some community service, say sorry... anything it couldn't have been easier.
I think it’s funny there is an Urgent Care behind them in the parking lot. You know- just in case….
what id they are just so hungry and cut thin elements of the slices off to eat themselves
I will gladly wait for a conspiracy video cuz I know it'll be worth the wait! But honestly anything you make is very entertaining and your editing  skills are awesome :)  its easy to tell how much you love making these, and as long as you are having fun doing it, it'll be incredible
i cant i love this LMAO
Ladies and gentlemen… That. 🤣
somebody get Shane an Oculus so we don't have to hear from him for another couple months
To the guy in the opening… so you mean anatomy ?
i lovvvvve you shannne
I had so much fun with this video. It’s such a 🅿️. 🤣  I just felt like I was chilling , being dumb with some friends and you should know that this made me feel so warm. And I really needed that right now. 💖💖💖💖  Thank you ☺️.
JFC first video in 3 months and already 2m views lol
Shane are you pushing 🅿️ ?
I was literally going to watch a video of yours because I was bored  and turns out you had posted
In the beginning of the video, when you discuss a simulated reality with your brother, is a good analogy of something that’s not far off from what a lot of spiritual (not religious) people believe and the so called “player” is called the higher self.  We are a collective consciousness having the same experience in this reality.  If we want to delve into conspiracy that some believe is actually happening, there’s people around the world who believe that there are entities who are trying to interfere with our intuition that help us out of this so called “game of life” and becoming aka enlightened beings.  The spiritual and physical go hand in hand.  I wish I was pulling this out of my ass but this information is all over the internet, books and ancient texts.  Think for yourselves and question all authority.
I missed your videos so much. im glad you re back :) you are my comfort person il your content
I remember getting the palette was so hard then I finally got it and I forgot my friend’s birthday so I gave it to her. Worst mistake I made🤦🏽‍♀️
Flip the pizza upside down and look at the burn patter from the bottom to see if it lines up
This was fun. :)
“if you’re watching this video you get it” i do in fact get it shane
Shane, you’re a bear, respectfully.
I think all this being kind of mean to eachother is foreplay and I love it! Its like ADHD erotica😅
Wait is he back?
I would love to help with your wedding....or at least come
Do you say hello?? I've missed you so much Shane i love you ❤️❤️❤️
What we should really be talking about is the fact that he really ordered traditional over stuffed crust. Who could ever… 😂
I’m sorry we did that to you Shane 😢 glad you’re back!
Yaaaasssw love you
I am going to make a podcast but idk where to start or what I need to anything >.<
HAII IVE MISSEDD YOUUUUUUUUUUU OMGGGGG ❤️❤️❤️💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💕💕❤️❤️💕🥰
Welcome back!! I missed you
Wait, hear me out, maybe they cut it into slices before they put it in the oven and that's why the pieces come out uneven
I reallt Like ur conspiracy and haunted location videos as a psychic medium I that stuff. ^_^ u make it feel more real than most
Chris is annoying
These chill videos are actually my favorites, love em
in the beginning when he put “I’m working on conspiracy videos” i started pulling a juice wrld
Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fuck yessssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!! Shane pod castNnnnnnnnn
Why haven't the FDA not been in to them.. Like what...
Shane is legit so handsome
why was that the shortest 43:23 of my life… apparently i need it to be 20 hours to be satisfied
I missed you so much! 🥺
sHaNe dOiNg a PoDcaST ICONIC
Chuckie  we’re friends 😂😂😂😂
Hey Shane are you going to have your podcast Spotify
BEING DOUCHY N TRASHING ON A PIZZA PLACE YOU TRASHED ON FIRST. SUED FOR A REASON
Yea no kids for them  ryland let him cheat you can do so much better and get a real family  you don’t need him anymore maybe there’s a reason y’all haven’t made it official !!
how is ur account not deleted yet
literally the first 45 seconds reminded of the movie "Inside Out" when they were talking about consciousness LOL
I was dying laughing this whole video. You are so funny shane! Really missed this content. Fuck the haters, everyone getting cancelled these days it’s ridiculous. Let people live and grow and thrive as they do, I say!
seeing just the notification that you posted mad me SO HAPPY. NOW GO MAKE A GHOST HUNTING VIDEO
I needed this and your videos back in my life. I hope they actually hit you up for a brand deal🤣💙
omg i missed u so much bestie
Bi-polar?
funny how everyone forgets
has chuck e. cheese LEARNED NOTHING
So fricken happy you posted shane xx
Ryland just says some shit and it be funny asf on accident
There is absolutely no way the world is a simulation. My life is way too boring 😅
When I was little, I would tell my mom that the pizza tastes like cardboard. So glad I don’t like that lol & I don’t like Burger King!
So it's a vlog without you actually holding the camera? :/
Seriously have not laughed this ha in awhile!! Love it!!😍
I feel like rylan is kinda hurting a bit 😮‍💨😅
WE LOVE YOU SHANEE 💕💕
So when is the podcast starting?
I refuse to believe someone is controlling my brain and just scrolling through TikTok and having an eating disorder
You were SO funny in this video lol. Your good sense of humor is back 100%, without anything bad from the past
I haven’t laughed this much since your last video! ❤️
I’m SOOO excited for your new podcast Shane!!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️
This and all of your videos are hilarious and entertaining, it doesn’t matter what you’re doing. Welcome back, we missed you! ❤️
I love this video. You guys are all so down! Thank you for the laughsss
The mentally ill needed you Shane. We’re glad ur back 🥰
A tight pussy isn’t a good thing. Your partner isn’t turned on if they are “tight”. I’m glad you all sleep with men, not women.
So you giving jojos shoes back or?? 🤣🤣
Are you guys breaking up? MARRY HIM! or me...whatever....
the way ppl just....alowed him bak
So, what Lawsuit is Shane talking about? I don’t hear him mention it once in the entire video, I hate clickbait. Especially from someone I love.
Shane, Drop a Link we Will buy That ENTIRE warehouse
@Shane Dawson I thought you would grow but you think cancelled is funny and continue not to change....do you hear yourself? You are gross...your topics are teenage humor at best.
I’m so glad ur back I love u Shane
Chucky cheese stuffed crust… I’d buy it. Lol
I’m sooo happy you are back!!! Can’t wait to see more videos or even podcasts!
Glad you’re back
Am I the only one who misses his classic DIY videos that he used to make from his kitchen and he’s have the Dick coffee Cup chilling in the background.
They just aren’t that funny anymore
Sending love to Ryland for being a good sport and Chris too. Glad Shane is back, parody is what I need in life. Just remember to reassure Ryland he is loved.
As someone who was a manager at CEC. we could have totally made a half traditional half stuffed crust lol
I love Ryland so much lol him eating the pizza in the car is so lovable
i watched this for like 6 times now, i really missed you shane!
Ryland eating the pizza being Chucky 🅿️
more nut jobs of america what a great country
Honestly, I think the new Chuckys looks way better. I don’t know WTF was going on with the old pies lol
Im the hate comment you’re looking for, fu(|< Shane
IVE MISSED YOU SHANE!!! ❤️❤️❤️
When I get any pizza for pick up I ask them not to cut it so no sauce leaks out in transport. It’s  a common request. You could do that for Chuck E. Cheese to ensure you get a whole pie.

This was very fun!  So glad to see you doing well and being more positive! You have so much value to add to the world and to the internet! Glad you are here! ❤️
Omg what happened to the fridge???
WAHOOOOOOO!!!!! 👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Shane and Ryland where are they now!? Not making candles like the Dolansssss
We love to see this
False, not everyone can hear their own voice in their head or imagine anything in their head.
p
ryland should get a job at chuck e. cheese💀💀
80 Dollars For three Large Pizzas 🍕 is A bit Much *
Ha ha ha. I didn't know you can drive 😁😁😁
MARRY RYLAND IN A CHEESE. DO IT
$80 for PIZZA?!??
i’m sorry…. $80 FOR 3 PIZZAS?!!!
Ellen, Chuckey and Shane, all canceled. I need that podcast.
Its perfect shane!! missed you and so happy you're back! ❤❤❤
So i guess the person playing shane's game is an a-hole
The people that claim they recycled the pizza when they worked there are either one disguisting employee or they are lying.
Oh so I didn’t dream this. Great! 👍
But you should order your pizza un sliced and slice it yourself
They only make medium pizzas so in order to get your large they have to add pieces from a different medium to create the large.
Missed you so much Shane. Hope that you'll post more often
We don't have Chucky Cheese here (where I live).  I'm glad you're back Shane. You guys crack me up!
Dis 🅿️
I miss you doing conspiracy videos those where really good videos u should upload more videos don’t let the haters get to u be strong Shane 😊😇
Hilarious as always!!
This was pretty funny lol
i havnt laughed this hard in so long ❤️
It’s not a simulation!!! We create simulations. The “player” isn’t a a player. It’s your Conscience given by God to know right from wrong.
why do people support this guy who harmed so many.. very sad.
The dynamic in this video was so funny 😂😂😂 I laughed so much
I used to work at CEC had to quit because of crappy management... So I enjoyed the slander! 😂
id go on your podcast.........i would talk alien abduction, energy fields around the  US........my murdered sister...........o yeah i got stories
I love Shane's dark, offensive humor. It just wasn't for YouTube. If he was a stand up comedian, he wouldn't have gotten canceled for his jokes. Maaayybe for shanaynay but that was just 2005 humor and we all laughed but obviously know better now.
I laughed so hard @ 9:58-10:10
“ before you know, you don’t know!” Lmfao
I love the long vlogs! I missed Shane! Please post a long video every week like ryland
This was great
I missed you Shane. The world Is back normal again. My laughs are back and stronger than ever!!!!
Ryland is so funny I love you!!!
Is it me? Or Does anyone else feel like Shane is giving off this sense of resentment towards Ryland?  I can't help but feel second-hand embarrassment. I would never want my future husband continuously, video after video, rolling his eyes at every comment or joke I made. Not in front of friends, and especially not in front of 20 million viewers. Ryland clearly adores Shane, and really puts in the effort to show that. Shane just shows anger, unwanting, and "can you believe this guy?" vibes. Really makes me sad.  I know Shane likes to joke, but I wish he would ease up a little bit.
Did anyone catch the $80 for pizza??? 😳
The new camera man is kinda annoying he laughs literally at everything Shane says...it feels so forced and fake
Awee Chris is so cute!! And handsome!!💞
You’re cancelled. Nobody wants this. So arrogant
Literally crying laughing at this. So glad you're back.
I want to go to Chuck e cheese and have a Shane Dawson themed party for my kids just to be petty.
Love you Shane Shane glad you’re back
I need the tight pushy energy merch
I missed these videos so much! Thank you for coming back!! Also was anyone else dying at the fact that there was an urgent care just right behind Shane when they were eating the pizza! I was just waiting for the dramatic zoom-in from Chris!😂😂😂 Love you both
Shane, marry Ryland already! He is the best fiancé you could ever ask for! He deserves the wedding of his dreams ASAP. Now that you guys live near family there is no excuse! You have the perfect venue in your own back yard!
Shane I am so glad you're back!!! You do you Bo❤️❤️ keep up all the good work and keep making awesome vids!
Bro is this the real shane
Maybe it would make sense if Chuck E cuts their pizza BEFORE putting it in the oven, so as it cooks and expands it looks ill-fitting...
I love the video
Listen y’all can judge me for this if you want, but I missed this
I love all ur videos!!!
Loved this video- Can’t wait to see your podcast!!! So glad you’re back!!!
I’m pretty sure they make them ahead of time and cut them and that’s why they look messed up. And if you order half and half they take half of cheese and half of pepperoni. And that’s why the slices also look like they don’t belong lol
🅿️= pimpin
I’m so glad you’re back! I missed laughing at your videos😭
"Preach, Brother." Killed me 😂
Man I don’t even care anything about everything! I love you fuckin guys! Y’all keep me laughing and that’s all that matters! Sorry
SHANE! You lost weight! Wtg ☺️
This fuvking channel i swear 😂
I’m not a dr just letting ya know - Shane Dawson 😂😂😂
Need more of your content you took to long of a break ☹️I literally had to search up ryland blogs to see you just Bc I missed your content
This is the old Shane I missed, but updated version. I’m actually glad it’s not a conspiracy video! Not saying I don’t love those videos too, because I do, I definitely just missed watching nonsense like this from you.
I love Shane’s humor! And have a Chucky day!
I miss the old Shane content but it's good and nice to see that he's happy continuing what he loves
Welcome back Shane! I missed you and am glad you are posting again! Your videos always brighten my day.
This was literally so good.
Bruh Shane is fucking hilarious and I missed this content
Welcome back Frodo 😌
Just a thought about the first 5 seconds...not everyone has a iner dialog. As in, that little voice telling you things in your head. It sound wired,  but check it out!  People with iner dialog vs people without iner dialog
is anyone else confused on the cars in the background of 11:49?
lol Shane describing how god put him together made me think that Shane is a human platypus :)  lol Love ya Shane
Yay he is back!!
Good video . Welcome back I'm glad you're back and happy .
I was so sad when "Shane and friends" ended!! Excited for the new podcast. <3 Love you Shane <3333
I miss those daily crazy food videos honestly make a different channel for them
no hunni it’s everything we wanted 💕💕💕
You make me smile. Your my friend no matter what
The simulation shit, no lol no, this is only a way to say we dont have a god/creator/allah
Is the kill bill shirt going to be the new pig shirt ?  I love you Shane you are looking really good I love the scruffle you look so manly in your big truck bear daddy 🧸👨‍👨‍👦‍👦
If you do have a small wedding Can I Go 😍😍💕💕 😊 I love you guys
Shane give ur house to me and my boyfriend, would be a good Youtube Ep just saying.
I don't know about anyone else but I've always enjoyed his raw humor.
You need to research George Soros and Hansjorg Wyss. Pure evil.
I would buy TPE merch lmao
Go away.
I haven’t been to Chuck E. Cheese in years like 40 years… But when I can remember they’re pretty fucked up with that loud music and a weird looking character shit. OK I’ve said my peace
I’m so happy to see you happy Shane ! Welcome back
Who else just excited for Nick DiRamios clip breakdown of this lol
Awwww…I want a pig mirror💕
W Shane
Thanks for coming back!!! Missed your videos 💜
Resting your throat, getting it ready 😜
I was smiling from ear to ear .. until Ryland appeared. Bad vibes we want to see you Shane not Ryland stop letting him try to steal your shine please. This is all about you, or the both of you. Not just him!
YES A PODCAST!!!
I feel like they should've asked for the pizza uncut... and seen what they did?
Hi Shane, so, i used to work in a chuck E. Cheese's in Mexico, and i can confirm to you that that's not a thing. It's just the way the workers cut and SERVE the pizza, i used to cut the pizzas right after they go out of the oven, put them in a board, cut them, AND THEN place them in a plate, the pizza it's still hot, the cheese it's melted, thats when you transfer the pizza in to a plate the pieces move, and that's why they look like that. We cut it, before we serve it.
🔥🔥🔥YES FINALLY 😩!!!!!!!!
I love that urgent care is by chucky E Cheese lmfao
Next Series: Shanaynay hood conspiracies.
The way I GASPED when you opened that box
Ryland - “ I didn’t put my face or finger in it but I put my dick in it.” Literally what every man (gay or straight ) says. 🤣
I want to buy your house but I can’t even afford a trailer here :,)
Tell me why this came up when I searched for the movie tusk. Anyway, so glad you’re back Shane!
It means it’s the same day, recycled 💀💀💀💀💀
We do live in the matrix, ...its called the federal and state government.
Anyone know if Shane still sells that pop socket that has the fire background and the Illuminati thingy on it?
This was so funny 😂😂😂
Ryland you're an otter
I wish I would have stayed gone
I love how Ryland gives no shits and continues to eat his pizza 😂
Disneyland video please
The iron man at the end 🤣🤣🤣
A podcast would be amazing!
where are all the mean comments
shane i’ve missed you so much!!
So good to have you back. Long, long overdue. Can't wait for the podcast  and more videos! <3
Things were so different back then with your old podcast. I used to listen to it doing home visits to see clients.
I hate watched this but honestly I'm glad I did cuz it was actually funny
We’ve missed you Shane!
Rich Lux should be your first guest on your new Podcast.
Yesssss I missed this shane!!!!
💜
I like the vlogs. I always enjoy you on Rylands channel.  Keep them up in between bigger projects. Vlogs don't have to be perfect, although I love the way you tell the story through editing. Just give it  to us raw once in a while, girl. 😆 I'm looking forward to the next big thing.
That disclaimer at the end about the pizza sounded like Chuck e cheese was holding you hostage..
You making videos is what we want! No matter the content you bring a breath of fresh hilarious air to everything you do! Love you Shane 🥰
Whats going on here
I LOVE that your back Shane! I LOVE your content, esp the conspiracy videos & hope you will do more of these. You seem so much happier, healthier and have shown so much growth. 🐷🐖❤️
This is the funniest video I’ve seen on YouTube in a long time 😂 So happy you’re back!
Shane seems so authentically himself for the first time in years
Hahahaha!!! I love this video, it’s so good to have you back and making hilarious content! I can’t wait for conspiracy and podcasts!!
Tight throat = Thrussy
Why do I find your humor so funny, laughed this whole video.
The amount of ads in the video are ridiculous but I watched them all bc I love Shane
The fact that ryland put the elf outfit on... Epic.. I wish I could hang out with you guys
I miss your food videos too!!!! And your conspiracy videos!
Hey Shane! Love you! Awesome video :)) Can you please share some love for Canada’s Freedom Convoy when you get the chance? We are fighting for love and for our rights up here and need all the support we can get ❤️🇨🇦🌄
I freaking love you
Ewwwwwww
I haven't laughed so hard. What a great dynamic. So fucking funny.
I am so happy to see you put out a video Shane, you're my all time favorite YouTuber and always will be ❤️ I laughed at a time when I needed it most
Ryland is never going to get married lmao. Sad day for you.
I am so with Shane's brother
Go away
🅿️
YAY! I’m so glad you’re back. Please don’t leave again.
Soooo happy he is back! His humor is 10/10.
Link to every bad thing Shane has done throughout his career everyone! :)) https://youtu.be/CbEQa9xf1vk
omg i’m so excited for the new conspiracy video ahhh
Hell yea Shane !!!! Ur freaking awesome !!!! 🖤👽🛸👻
no
Literally laughing so loud
pushing 🅿️ shane 🤣🤣
Lol 3rd time I'm watching. I am still laughing as hard 😂😂😂🤣🤣 you guys are so crack up. Can you pretty please do another haunted hotel with the squad?
Bring back the raunchy food reviews.. peak comedy of YouTube
There’s finally a reason to open the YouTube app again. Let’s gooooooo
Am I imagining this scenario or was ryland super uncomfortable this video because Shane was flirting with the camera guy?
LMAO im fucking dead. SENIOR POOH
When you’re doing videos that YOU enjoy and enjoy making, your audience responds better. I enjoy watching you enjoy and be confident. You’re still here for a reason Shane.
Shane, how the heck are ya? It’s been so long since I watched one of your videos…So so good to see you and see you are doing well. I use to watch you on the daily. I got off the tube for some time, just watching my cooking and shopping vids for the past couple of year’s. I will definitely have to stop in more often. Take care of yourself hun..I wish you well always!
Shane,I'm so glad you are back! You are iconic in EVERY way and this video is GOLD. thank you! Ps:I also love you because you're a Cancer,like ME! ♋️ ♡
SO SO GLAD YOU ARE BACK!  TIGHT PUSSY ENERGY HEY
Welcome back shane <3 our past does not define us and trauma makes us think and say stupid things sometimes.  Missed your content
This video made my day happy welcome back shane!
Check out this New Clip -thank you. https://youtu.be/d6JDzRfhexI
Legit in the middle of watching the pizza unboxing- a Pizza Hut commercial comes in during the video lol
We all know that pizza looked suspicious……
Chris: “I did walk In them one time”  Shane: 😐😦😭…”let’s try these cookies”
I work at Chuck e cheese and I have no idea why your pizza looks like that ours doesn't
Even the pepperoni that have been cut doesn’t line up on the next slice beside it.   😳😳😳
Also, what happened to the regular camera bloke?
Shane you’re glowing inside and OUT!! I can totally see your new confidence on camera and you look amazing physically :)
Lol ryland is definitely a twink lol in the gay world and I think Shane would be considered a bear cause the scruff and his size but like maybe a teddy bear lol cause he so sweet and soft
The voice in your head is because you are an empath and this is your life path. You have done all of what you have supposed to have done so far and you have so much to go!
Ugh it’s so good to have Shane back. Now all we need is Jenna to come back and my life will be complete 😌
Another conspiracy theory is that there is an Urgent Care or some type of Care facility near every Chuck E. Cheese location
Finally your back!
Yippee,  Shane is back. Missed ya 🤟❤🤟
what if y'all ordered a specialty pizza? because it would HAVE to be made as a whole pie??
Conspiracy and haunted places videos , please!
Buy
I love you! I don’t give a crap what ppl be saying about you. I’m glad your back! You are amazing! I would too like to see more conspiracy videos
I'm so glad to see you back doing what you love to do. You look so happy and in such a good place. Looking forward to your podcast!!!Sometimes life puts a moutian in front of you because your the only on who can move!
Finally Shane 😘🙏
I would love to do a reading for you Shane that would be so dope…glad your back! 💜👽🔮a

You're so happy now🥺
this is exactly what we want !!!🤩🤩 love you .
im actually gonna watch the conspiracy video cuz I love those
Good like
So happy your back😍
Cancel it 🤡🤣😂🤣 I'm dead 🤣😂
oh my god i missed shane
I WANT WHATEVER YOU GIVE US....💗❤️💙
Shane is pushin p
i love watching your videos they make me so happy
Not only did I want this I needed it, I’m struggling with overcoming an addiction and this completely took my mind off a craving, thank you, keep being you🌸❤️
Omg ~ blended family ~ that had me dyinggg
You so go back and ask for an uncut pizza to see what they look like uncut 😂
Chuckie Cheese pizza is gross! Glad you are back
I missed you but I miss your conspiracy theory videos more
I really liked that you are also trying other topics as well. It keeps the interest flowing...dont worry too much about what other people will think. Honestly many people nowadays are simply just nasty.
Yay! ❤️ He is back
i think it’d be so cool is chuckie cheese allowed you guys to be in the back for a day to make pizzas; could be a bit tongue and cheek but allow closure to the weird shapes!
Hey I used to work at chucke for 2 years and I can actually let you know what goes in the kitchen I’ve also made and cut them not lying I have the lanyard for it
✨señior poooooooh✨
“Made me republican jk” LOL
the food vids i would dieeeeeee
#bobsworldlevel
Maybe they slice it before they bake it? Quirky of them but like… maybe?
I LITERALLY HAD A DREAM LAST NIGHT THAT I WAS SO SAD THAT I NEVER GOT TO SEE SHANE'S OLD PODCAST!!! WOAH..
I love how a lot of you guys probably hated on him and the time things where coming out about him, and now kissing his ass lol. Saying oh am so happy your back or I never cared what other people said about you.Shane and others like him should never  have so many people still backing him up y’all are annoying. But I bet if it was some one else it would be different.
LMAO "wait..I could go in, if I cover my face you'd just think I'm Celo Green" 🤣😭
Not Shane pretending that he never made a podcast in the past and that whole era doesn’t exist… 😬😬😬 yes, this is a totally “NEW” plan and idea lol 17:16 - oh wait he does mention it 😂
Tbh. He's changed. And I love him sm. I'm so excited for him coming back to YouTube. I fall asleep the conspiracy playlist every night and wake up with the videos still playing.
I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time 🤌🏽💋
Im so excited that u have a new video... i hope u keep doin them... but i had an idea.... Ask for an uncut pizza and see if they do that.... that way you kno it's the same ??? Hahaha
I was having a terrible day and you made me smile and forget for a little bit thank you
SHANE I MISSED YOU!!! Glad to see you mentally and spiritually healthy. Hoping for a great year for you! Again MISSED YOU IN MY SUBS <33
What makes people want to watch this?
流光之城
I love Shane in this format, talking with the camera man and with some fun editing. I hope the podcast still transmits the crazy chaotic energy
$80 for 3 pizzas!?!
I saw Chuck E Cheese pizza in the frozen pizza section of my local grocery store! 🤣
HES BACK!!!!!!!!!!!! YASSSSSSZZA.
I'm here for @Richlux
i have been following shane since the beginning! i love all his content, even the older videos from almost a decade ago haha. we had a similar upbringing. he has and will always be my favorite youtuber!
You look GREAT
Came here to make sure people are being nice to my Shane Bear 🐻 😂😂 and saw you’re #3 on trending!!!! Yes!!!! Amazing!!
流光之城
I loved this video so much it’s so great to have you back but one small thing maybe tone it down on the inappropriate talk
So happy you're back!!!❤❤❤ you look and sound so happy and that makes me so happy❤❤
Love your idea for a podcast and I find it interesting that having a lazy eye myself, that I never noticed that you have one too.
I’m with Ryland, tbh. The pizza is delicious lol
All I'm gonna say is...you should've got stuffed crust pizza lol
Oh my god oh my god oh my god
Thank God u made a video, I miss u Shane!!!! Plz keep going. Ryland stop eating that awful pizza plz. I'm from NY I cringe every time u take a bite & say it's good OMG! 💗
Funniest video on this channel.
About time
Fuck you mean "the"? We all know you got about two or three lawsuits under your belt 💀😭
Thanks for the P
Legitimately missed you so much.
I love this haha. I’m glad your back!!!
I grew up watching your videos, always enjoyed your content, happy you're back, and laughing at you almost getting sued by a children's restaurant chain, it's very on-brand for you.
ryland watching the first 4 minutes of this like 😒 lmao
They have frozen chunky cheese pizza that you can buy from krogers
New podcast title: A little bit of a hot mess with Shane Dawson
Cringy as every
The president of Honduras has been arrested by the United States! The Chinese government should also arrest the president of Taiwan!
I’m in the hospital again and I was soooooooo thrilled when I saw a new Shane video…so grateful when your second home is the hospital.
Shaaaaaane! I'm so happy to see you happy! This video made my day!! You bring so much light to the world! A podcast from you will LITERALLY be my favorite thing ever!!! Love you!!
haha i miss the old p.o. box opening videos lol
Although I’m not a fan of all of your jokes, I’m so happy to see your videos again
se yhw yak
iconic
Not gonna lie, I laughed a LOT! 😂
Yayy you are back
Shane 💙 we're all glad you are back no matter what the video is
So glad your back...missed you love your videos
Shane looks great!!!
I smiled throughout the whole video; it ain't a stupid video, Shane, I found it wholesome and hilarious. Seein' you have the happiness you deserve cheers me up😊 So hyped about the wacky food videos coming back and the new SDPodcast, your old podcast has helped me so much in life❤️❤️
I love you Shane I miss you💛 I’ve been watching you foreverrrrrrr
My guess is that they have pizza’s where they take singular slices from to sell, and then add those together when people order. That’s all that my brain can assume so i don’t het turned off by their pizza😂😂
I really am into conspiracy videos tho if you really are planning on doing that in the future. One that is well thought out, clear steady commentary about different conspiracies
Haunted videos
This was painful to watch...
I love seeing how confident you are in this
i can’t remember the last time i laughed this hard. thank you 🙏🏼
I missed you so much shane
Shane pushing 🅿️
Needed this!! Thanks Shane 🖤
I wanna work at Chuck E. Cheese to see why it’s like that
Shane. Listen honey. I'm getting married in September. And we're getting married in the place where we met (our college library) with a total of 30 guests (immediate family and only a few friends... the people that really matter). And we're having pizza in the school cafeteria for like an hour after. That's IT. If you're having issues with the guest list... fuck everyone else and invite who YOU want there. DO YOU GUYS!
I loved this video so funny it’s awesome your back !
I love how there’s an urgent care right by the Chuck E. Cheese if you look out the window behind Shane in the car 😂😂😂
Ooo i love when Jarid hops on the video! One of my favs is the flat earth conspiracy
What a Humble Queen. 👑♥️
Ryland: I’ve gotta poop me, on the toilet: same
we’ve all have seen how much you’ve changed and your not that same person you were.
Four minutes in and I already love this too much
I wish Shane would do his old style conspiracy theory videos
Ryland trying to stop Shane from getting another lawsuit from them is so funny
This video made me realize how much I actually missed you Shane. All of us OG fan still love you ♥️ 🐷
Please please please make TPE merch! I’ll buy it
I’m just gonna say I love you so much Shane and I work at little cesars and I have never made or seen a pizza leave the store looking like that lol 😂
nearly died cause of laughing! you made my day !!!😍❤
Yasssss!!
You need Rich lux!
i love your food videos tbh HAHAHAHAHAHA
Shane’s face when you opened the box sent me to a whole other universe 😂😂
Missed you! So happy to see you back ❤️
😂😂🤣🤣🤣 I loved this
Do a conspiracy videos of suicide victims of x factor for the start.. 😜
The chuck e pizza still looks whack
Im so excited for the podcast
Shane I know it's not Halloween time ... but I fricken love when you guys do haunted content .. please do one !!!!!!!!!! 🙏
It's been a while since Shane droven a car but now  TRUCK I'm soo impressed  😁
Chucky Cheese actually needs to like step it up because they’re the only pizza place that fucks up the shape so much 🥴
I’ve never said nor thought one bad thing about you. Cancel culture is ridiculous. We all make mistakes. And in the 2000s it was common to see ppl use that type of crude humour, in fact it was popular. Ppl laughed then and the same ppl ten years later cry about it thinking they’re the only ppl capable of change. It’s ridiculous. You never deserved what you went through. I’m so happy to see you on the other side of that shitstorm Shane. Been a loyal subscriber for 10 years 🤍
Shut up
Love this and you
... *shane* ... *listen*
Maybe they only cook full pepperoni or full cheese and then take the two half’s and make them into a new one instead of cooking it together that way? And they already cut the pizzas and store them so they have to piece them back together?
Serotonin overload!! This video made me so so happy and I can’t wait to subscribe to your podcast
I love u  shane <33 don’t listen to any hate i still watch all ur old vids and r looking forward to see more conspiracies:)

I think I’m more concerned that they spent $80 on three pizzas than the way they look😂😮‍💨 they to be sus tho
YAY glad your back, keep it up
Me and the significant other love your videos! Please keep going! More frequent videos would make our day!
You missed out not getting the churros
I’m so happy
you're a predator
Weird guy
Where is the food video:(
it makes me so happy seeing you happy and smiling
We want more videos from Shane
Okay we’re fully over your cancellation now lol come back king. Just pls don’t make scary sxit
This dude literally milking his own pedophila for conspiracy/drama content...
i also got a pizza ad during this.. and DIED LAUGHING
Shane you need to order a pizza and ask them not to cut it!  This will definitely debunk it!!
But what does the E stand for?!
I’m dying. I love the non censored and the honesty
i get so excited every time you post.  i giggle like an idiot
No but can we talk about O’Riley had ONE L. NOT TWO.
ALSO YES PLEASE MORE CONSPIRACY VIDEOS I LIVE FOR THOSE.. sorry I will calm down now <3
love it
It has to be the dough they use, looks like it shrinks and settles after getting out of the oven maybe
The ADHD in this video is contagious. Don’t worry, I already have it :)
Ryland is just the best! Shane, you need to marry that man ASAP!
I would love more conspiracy videos Shane 😘 so glad you’re back
What a great video!! Loved it 😍
He is problematic but goddamn he’s funny
Holy shit it’s Jared!!
Drew should have been there to criticize that pizza with you 😢
I don't speak for all Mexicans but I am Mexican and the Pooh bear joke was funny I laughed ... The self awareness made it funnier. 🤷
You should do a follow-up on Eugenia, last I saw she could use some help again.
I'm so glad you're back doing what you love Shane! Looking forward to the podcast and more future content!<3
I just love everything about this.
Love you Shane ❤️
I loved this video so much Shane!!! I’m so happy you’re back on YouTube!!!!! ️️️
If you do a podcast can it also  be a video I find it useful for me to listen better 😉 👍
It’s the urgent care in the background across from a Chuck E. Cheese for me
The urgent care behind Chuck E. Cheese is iconic…
Love ya Shane, but I think you get a so sidetracked when you’re talking that I’m not sure I could listen to you on a podcast lol I would be like GET TO THE POINT
Just you being you is perfection
STOPP IM SO SCARED FOR YOU TO GET A LAWSUITTTTT
Totally had to watch this one more time. Amazing.
I haven’t laughed so much in a long time! So glad you are back!❤️ This made my week!
Loved the video. So glad to see you feeling so happy and looking so great. Keep pushing forward. XOXO
I am actually so excited to see another video about this 😂 brings me back to a simpler time 🍕🐭👌🏻
welcome home. where is Shaynay? we need her and D to show up again. seriously we need some smiles and laughter in the darkness we've been through.
Our Chuck E Cheese was shut down and turned into a Mattress Firm. Talk about doubling up on conspiracy.
Thank you for just being your authentic self
This was amazing 🤩 can’t wait for the next video. When you do what you enjoy it really shines through. I needed the laughs today, thank you 💕❤️
Dude I thought of an idea make a mark where you know that's the slice you had then return the pizza you bought tell them you ordered pepperoni not cheese or leave your left over slices on the table there and then get a friend to come to order cheese pizza and see if that slice you marked is in their box!!! That's the perfect way to solve this. Markings could be a pepperoni placement and or cut in half pepperoni and positioned somewhere or a super thin needle like line on the back of a slice
I enjoys your video's keep them coming  Love your tons
I’m so pissed! Lol where have you been
This is the Shane I have always loved to see, fun and light hearted! So glad you are back! ❤️
🅿️
It’s a mouse because mice eat cheese 😂 also $80 for 3 pizzas is so much
It’s just not the same.
Señor Pooh 😂😂😂
Bruh, a podcast called “cancelled anonymous” where you interview cancelled people and why they got cancelled would be so good. But also a conspiracy theory podcast, we need both 😂
I sometimes like to go back and re-watch D'Angelo's video just in case I ever make the mistake of thinking about fogiving Shane.
I freaking love Ryland
Did anyone else burst out laughing whey Shane asked if they did weddings?
I laughed out loud so many times. I support you and what you create! A podcast would be dope.
My life has been empty without you.... which makes me question my character 😂😂 jk Ive really missed you and I'm happy to see you're posting videos again!!!!! 🥰🐷
Bitch I fuckin missed you! Also you're looking like a skinny king
Love this!!! Brings back good memories of your vids back in the day :)
I’m all in for conspiracy theories videos
i've missed youuuuu
Shane u look great 👏🏽
LMFAO PLS WHO LET HIM BACK
Don’t give up my friend loved and will still always love your channel ❤️🙏
“i wanna do a podcast” because that went so well last time 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
i love this
Dude you have no idea how I miss ur videos- hoping that you are able to upload more often
I'm so happy you're back! I cannot wait to see the ideas you come up with. I loved this a lot, so many good laughs. 😅
OMG 😭😭😭 UR PUSHIN 🅿️
Pushin P frfr
Not gonna lie.. it's a bit of a shame that Ryland is kinda stuck with Shane. He is a good guy that's just easily influenced. He can do better. I feel like he chooses Shane for money tho which is karma so whatever lol
It would be harder to make pizzas out of scraps than to just make a new one
From watching his videos in 09 to now it’s crazy how long ago that was …missed his videos
Enjoyed the video and I'm so excited to see your new content and listen to your podcast. So glad you're back!
I've missed this
I loved everything about this 😂 so happy you’re back!!!
my favorite part of this video was “i’m really scared that you’re eating it….. because it’s so dangerously good”
JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU, AND I DO TOO. HEAVEN AND HELL ARE REAL!!
“It’s the 🅿️ for me” 🤣🤣🤣
WAITING FOR THE WEDDING🤌🏽
Shane I Love you I’m stressing out about my midterms and watching your videos makes my day a lot better. 🥰 hugs
I hope you make the podcast for YouTube this time kind of like how rylands podcast  is, so people like me will be able to listen/watch it, keep up the good work tho I love your videos
disgusting. delete your page
I cracked up. I missed these haha.
I love shane
For me, it’s not about the content. Your personality and just watching you is what I enjoy the most. Keep being you 🤍✨
Honestly I could see u both getting married in Las Vegas by either Elvis or something 🤣❤️🥰😍 actually THAT I want to see. Like a luxury Vegas wedding with Elvis?! FUCK YES! ….I’d say ‘I’ll go home’ but I’m literally at home 🐷
I really haven’t laughed like this in a while and it’s amazing, I’ve genuinely needed this since I lost my father in October. Thank you so much for always bringing a smile to my face no matter how much time is between your posts ♥️
PETITION TO BRING BACK SHANES FOOD VIDEOS
Love this video!!! So funny, this might be the highlight of my day 😂😅
Unironically I work at goodwill and I believe someone donated a conspiracy hoodie? I was shocked!
You. Can tell that ryland is a little upset bout  it still lol.
Gets sued again for throwing shade lol
I love this video, not much into conspiracy theories. We have enough in the world today.  But love the daily vlogs
Ryland I know your pain!!! Me and my soon to be hubby are having a hard time planning our wedding and for him it's the bipolar mode he has but been engaged sense 2018...
I’m just happy you’re making videos again :) You guys seem like you’re insanely fun to hang out with! <3
For the record, I’ve supported you 100% all the way through. Love you!! So glad you’re back!! 😭❤️😭❤️ I’m so happy
Yes bitch !!!! Love Shane lol
I’m soo happy that you are back!!! I can’t wait to watch all your videos again! Missed you❣️
The pizza thing makes sense because when you order half a pizza, you are probably getting an used half?
You’re trending AGAIN in a good way lmao
SO SO HAPPY YOU’RE BACK😭😭 i needed this serotonin back in my life🙌🏼
can you STOP CARING ABOUT SJW TWITTER TROLLS fucking FINALLY? More than 90% of your audience doesn't care about the offense police. Move on PLEASE. Look at PewDiePie, the more you care the more it affects you.
I worked at me n Ed’s annnd our pizza never looked out of place 😂 we made our own dough, placed it on the cutting table, cut it with a pizza cutter and yea it was all good. C.C. try again 😂
...
Okay but if a lawsuit is what gets you uploading  Imma find a reason 😭🤣
I love Shane but I feel like he bullies Ryland and I’m worried it’s not just an act 😞he’s kind of mean to him! His flirting with Chris clearly makes him uncomfortable, he makes fun of his gayness and simultaneously him not feeling comfortable in public being himself with a purse, etc. (in their vlogs), he jokes about never marrying him, and you can always tell Ryland is hurt.
Would love to see this dude behind bars LMAO
Oh I missed these! So glad to have you back! And yes I miss those good videos too lol 😂
99.9% of this video is just downright fucking weird i’m sorry
i love this and it made my day
not jamie lynn in the end lmao !!!
They precut and bread will shrink as it cools
These comments switched up real quick
Ryland's going to lose it when he finds out what P stands for lmfaooo
The Jojo shoes are always a hit😂🥺
The amount of times I fucking laughed in this video
This is not a joke- I got an ad with a flying pig in it lol
I missed you.
Shane I love you and missed you dearly
I'm so excited to hear about your podcast!!!! I miss your interviews SO much, yours were always the best!
I enjoyed all of this! Makes my day 🅿️ anytime you upload ♥️🐷
We all know that pizza is not fresh everyday😂 it just took Shane to discover it😂
Shane : I know this probably isn’t what you want.   Me barely 4 minutes in: this is absolutely what I want😂😂😂
You are definitely back
I don't care that you are "canceled" Shane i'm glad you are back
Coronavirus was first isolated from chickens in 1937! Then we'll see the bird flu in the United States! Who  give  people to eat bird flu chicken ?
So happy to watch a video of yours, can’t wait to watch some conspiracies!!!
I love you Shane. I’ve watched you since day 1 . You have grown so much! I love you:)
and missed u
i love u
😭😭😭😭😭SHANE!! I’ve been binging all your videos!!! So glad you are back once more! Missed you so much!
That pizza oh no!!!!
So glad to see you back!! ❤️
😋stay positive in life Shane.💖
Ok on the intro clip: I feel like we have to address it seriously because if you hear a voice that says “oh don’t do this or you’ll die or someone you love will die” that’s most likely OCD or anxiety and it’s important to call that out. Tho I know this is just meant to be entertaining ❤️
Shane you are everything !! 💙 keep doing what you do I love you just the way you’ve been I’ve been lucky enough to have seen you grow go through hardships and I love to see you overcoming obstacles in life can’t wait to see your new videos and I hope to see more of your smiles and happy moments with love one of your fans 😁💙
You guys need to make your own pizza and cut it, it comes out different shapes like their pizzas do 🍕
Yayyy love you Shane!!! :)
We did make it to 2022! Proud of us!
Shane! Has Chris ever had a crunch wrap?
talk about the selena gomez & keneka conspiracy
I love you man, I’m so glad you’re back! 😁
I have never missed someone I've never met so much, never unsubscribed
The pizza photos literally had me laughing so hard
Love you! You look great! Glad you’re back!
What they are probably doing is they are making the pepperoni and cheese separate, cutting them both, and then putting them together.
SHANEEEE you asking for them to come after your ass again 😂😂😂😂
I was going through Shane withdrawals I’m glad your back!
Anyone else find Shane talking about vaginass weird.. like we get it you had a dream but it but seemed like you and Ryland enjoyed making of female anatomy. I'm so tired of men bashing women for their bodies.
So you watched all of the Marvel movies?? THEY'RE SO GOOD!! Did you see the shows too??
I want pizza now
I missed you so much!
IVE MISSED YOU 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Bring back the galaxy!!!!
$80 for pizza😭😭😭 nooooo
i love how genuinely happy you seem now, this is exactly what we want. ❤️❤️ we love you!!!!
We have missed you so so much !!!!
I’m so disappointed he’s still spreading this misinformation.
I died this whole episode. I’ve been here since the beginning and I was always here for your humor. I’m a former manager of a pizza place and even if slices slid in the box they would still line up when pushed together. Welcome back Shane!
I get it
We love a trending queen
I love how chuck e cheese LOWKEY recognised ryland
Hi Chris! Love you and hope you’re doing well 💕😊 and thank you Shane for the content!
i find it funny at the end theres a urgent care in the background. IN A CHUCK E CHEEZE PARKINGLOT
Magnificent
THE GAMING SIMP
a minute in and it couldn't be any worse
His new content feels so much more real and authentic. It’s nice to hear Shane’s real voice.
Dog crossed the rainbow Bridge on Sunday. Your video brought me peace of mind and laughs. Thank you 🙏💔🐕🦋
Y’all still don’t know how they cut the damn pizzas! Come on bro! They aren’t using a pizza roller thingy FYI. It’s like a sword 🗡 that they grab both ends and twist the pizza as they cut it. Shit gets moved around lol goddamit.
Shane you better FEEL all the forgiveness in the cimments. Also angels told me to tell you to check out teal swans YouTube channel
The happiness I felt when I saw you posted a new video 😊
What does P mean?!!
Probably the best way to tell if the slices come from the same pizza is to flip it over and check the crust.
no one cares
SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU BACK AND HAPPY 🥰❤️
I love that ur back!! Podcast sounds like a great idea!
The Christopher three way needs to happen! Then put it on OF ;)
SHANE PLS GIVE US STRAIGHT PEOPLE UR THOUGHTS ON ALL THE MARVEL MOVIES
I really loved this vlog, you looked like you were having a lot of fun making it and it really cheered me up. Can't wait to see what you upload next ♥️
Okay but Crumbls catering your wedding…
The urgent care next to the Chuck E. Cheese 🤣
Looks like perfectly normal pizza. Have you never cut a pizza before?
shane, i’m dying laughing. you’re so funny and i missed you so much. don’t know if you’ll read this but, your my favorite youtuber, artist, comedian, tik tok star, instagram star. all of the above. my dream one day is to meet you. but anyway, i love you shane, and i’m so glad your back to making videos. <3
I know this is super off topic, but WHERE DID YOU GET THAT GIANT BEAN BAG????? I GOTTA GET ONE!!!!!!! Someone please tell me!!!  Shane, you’re my favorite YouTuber, love you lots!!!!!
Shaaaneeee you should also know that the pizza cutter as chuck e cheese is dull, as a safety precaution, so there's a lot of movement required to cut the pizza all the way through, often times moving the pizza vigorously.
Love u so much plz keep posting I love you love the positive vibes 💗always remember you are worth it you are a beautiful person inside an out love love love you and honey I love your soul an believe in you 💗
This was so bad I'm turning it off after 12 minutes because I would rather talk to my dad then finish this video
im not gonna lie - i did cut up your shirt and use it for rags :| I still like you I swear - no hate! I just felt really weird wearing it out bc of everything and it was  shanaynay and I just didn't feel the same way about it anymore - still love you shane!
miss shanes sit donw videos SO MUCH he should make a vlog channel for these typa videos cuz i just wanna get to the point sometimes
Tyson Foods, the nation's largest meat processor, said on Monday that it had detected bird flu at a facility of about 240000 chickens in Kentucky, raising concerns about the expansion of the epidemic.
I’ve literally NEEDED this, I haven’t laughed like this in so long I missed you
The internet forgets fast and completely
I don't care what the content is. I love it all! You living your best life brings me joy!
You should do a follow up on brittani Taylor
❤️❤️I'm so happy to see you back making videos I really missed them 💕
We missed you sm Shane ❤️❤️❤️
20 mins is the average time to make a pizza. All your doing is putting on cheese toppings and more cheese which take 7 mins at most and then it goes into the oven and the oven takes 5 mins. (My place has the oven set to 600 degrees Fahrenheit) so it generally doesn't take long
💜💕💜 love ya
😆 hilarious, love it 😍 we missed you!!!
can't wait to see what you have in store for the future! Love you guys! ❤️
Shocking: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=L-XhKnVeejA
Do a conspiracy video on the government using Covid as an excuse to seize power over us and people still believe that masks matter 😪
I laughed so hard....Glad ur back and doing good.
not the fucking URGENT CARE in the same parking lot as them lmfaooo
Bring on more Conspiracy vids please!
You guy’s are the greatest ❤️❤️
don’t care what anyone says, i’m so glad you’re back
Im so happy your starting to post again we missed you!
Lol 😂 I laughed basically all through this video
Great to see you again Shane! I'm glad you're doing so well. Can I ask some advice on how you're doing so well? What you did to start feeling better?
🤣🤣🤣🤣 welcome back, this was amazing
I absolutely loved this video! Please do more omg this is amazing! Much love ❤️
We didn’t need you back…
Missed you Shane!
I got so excited when I saw you posted a new video keep them coming anything you do I just love everything.... great having you back and glad your happy with your life xx
yes 😭 my fav person has returned
I feel like hes trying hard to be more sensitive with his jokes. I see you trying shane. I hope you keep uploading❤️ but i hope you stay true to yourself too.
ppl over here talking about chuck e cheese pizza conspiracies when that used to be my #1 favorite type of pizza
“Colorado changed me, Mede me republican.”  I diiiiiied 💀
I have missed you!!!!
Everyone makes mistakes don't let it keep you down I believe you have grew from your mistakes 💯 now get to the good stuff you got locked away in that mind of yours I believe in you Shane 💯
So glad your back :) you helped me out a lot over the years and missed you a lot❤️ I’m still so glad your back to doing what you love ❤️
I laughed the whole time 😂😂
Maybe you would have a guess list for your wedding if you didn’t treat all your friends like garbage.
conspiracy videos are very much something i am not into at all....I am an adult tbh and find them irrational. I originally was not happy about your return but this vlog was actually hilarious.
All these positive comments make my heart happy. So glad you’re back Shane! ❤️
I feel like the only way we can put the whole Chuck E. Cheese conspiracy thing to rest is if someone records them making the pizza and cutting it.
My Friend use to work at Chuckie Cheese . The stuff you said she literally confirmed you weren’t lying . She hated working there but loved the co-workers . So I hate this even happened to you Shane . Glad you are back posting ❤️
I needed this video!!  also Ryland's outfit made me pee 🤣
Did I seriously just get a SHANE DAWSON video in my recommended? What the fuck YouTube! No! And now I’m boosting the chances by commenting Fuckin’ hell
I can't wait I will be there faster then it takes to load really I'm there love you I can't wait you will be great
Go back and asked for a uncut pizza you only like a certain way cut you will do yourself see what it looks like
Omg I’ve missed your videos so much Shane!!!
You can clearly see how much Ryland adores Shane - he's willing to go out in public in his Santa's helper dress and Jojo Siwa shoes just because Shane asked lol 🤣🤣🤣 even if he did take it off - he literally left the house wearing it lol.
No thanks creep.
This was funny as hell I love these types of videos
Who wpuld jave ever thought Ryland would but on a damn santa dress
Not even 2 minutes into the video and I nearly choked to death on my dinner when I heard him say "Hi Chrissy!" unexpectedly lol
So glad to see you back 💌🥰  Chuck E Cheese watching this video-👁👄👁
Shane : “ What do ya say chuck E , What do ya say ? “  Ryland : “ Let’s get you in that suit “  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I feel so sad for ryland. I know Shane is joking around but I’m sure it’s hard for ryland to continuously hear how Shane misses certain things. And you can hear his sadness and idk I wish Shane would be more cautious of rylands feelings when saying those things.
I liked how you went to get pizza 💀
Oh my Gosh I missed you soooooooo much. I literally died laughing from beginning to end. Ahhh never leave us again xo love you 💗🥰✨💞
Really glad your back Shane you can post whatever makes you happy I would watch anything you post as long as you make jokes like usual
Shane   I’ve been here since the beginning, through the ups and downs the laughter and tears. Through the scandals and break throughs..  I’ve never seen you so happy!  I’m excited to see what’s to come! And I’m so happy about this podcast! I missed it! Just praying for more scary videos!!! ❤️❤️
So happy to see you guys happy and laughing. Glad you guys are doing good! Never been happier to see a YouTube notification in my life! Seeing that you uploaded made my day a lot better. Thank you. I will always support you no matter what, just like I have always done. ❤️❤️❤️
Republicans are awesome! I’m more libertarian
Absolutely love your videos ...Your so awesome and hilarious 😂. Your just so full of life and so sweet ... keep making great videos ...💗
Currently in a psych ward for my depression and suicidal thoughts so I get you babe 😂💖💀!
Yes to more conspiracies!!!
Come thru Shane!!!
The first guy watches the matrix once and think he understands reality
Now im craving for pizza
haven't watched it yet but i'm excited to, i love you and your content so much so happy you're posting again <3
“ P “  means playa, “player” according to the artist who started it, Gunna, now it’s a trend.
I love how you spiral, because uhmmmm same!! But in all honesty, I would love to see more of you, my husband even loves watching your videos when I am in the living watching an upload of yours. A conspiracy about how everyone's like waking the F up and quitting their day jobs and how sleep has been sooooo effed up since covid hit...like I literally don't sleep, now my son has trouble sleeping as well. A spooky video for spring would be epic! Love you Shane! ❤
Shane, I have asthma I can't be laughing like this. I about died 🤣😂
Am I the only one thinking shane is growing apart from ryland secretly.. He didn’t deny missing 😸 . & he wont marry ryland because his suit?
Hi I work In a hunts brothers and the reason why a pizza would have slice would shift is because or the citing then puting in the box  the slighes mover around and it is frustrating but it's still the same pizza
Coming soon: the lawsuit of Shane Dawson pt 2… AND TRYING CHUCK E CHEESE FOR THR THIRD TIME.  Sorry I had to hahahaha, I honestly enjoyed this so much
just a quick question; why are urgent care facilities in America always located in strip malls? i’ve seen so many and it’s always confused me. in canada it’s always just a hospital with a lil urgent care department can someone explain
Did anybody else have  a Domino's ad pop up 🤣
❤
This is exactly what I wanted.
Shane in the background when ryland was on the phone with Chuck e cheese 😂😂
Ryland was comedic gold during this video 😂
You're so enjoyable to watch
THE PEPPERONIS DONT LINE UP
Deactivate your account
I missed this old goofy Shane so much🥺😫
In the beginning of the video about the game thing it a movie already
I’ve had the shitiest few weeks and this was exactly what I needed. I genuinely haven’t laughed this month in so long. I have tears from laughing. Love u Shane. Thank you for this
UN PERREITO ECUATORIANO🇪🇨🇪🇨🎶  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah67FaBX-L8
Shane you are literally still funny as ever 🤣🤣 missed you and welcome back 😁
Shane please marry ryland I think it’s really making him feel insecure…
Sooooooooooooo, can you get sued for telling the truth??? (wink, wink .')
I love that Shane’s back ❤️
i literally love you 👯‍♀️
I think if you order a half cheese half pepperoni pizza, they make a full cheese and full pepperoni, cut them in half and put them in the same box. Like mix and match
We didn't forget
The funny thing is I really didn't expect him to be driving the truck lol
TRENDING!!!!!! Welcome Back!!!!
I haven't seen his brother since he first made his youtube channel. Cool guy with glasses. Had to look it up. Lol
“Chris Crumble”
Love to see you, Shane !  love the laughter!
Probably what happened is someone just ordered one piece and they have a bunch of mix match pizzas back there. It’s all fresh, but just missing a few pieces.
All the ''welcome back'' comments make me want to 🤮🤮🤮
Let's be real, I don't think anyone expects a Chuck E. Cheese pizza to be perfect lol. They don't come to mind when I even simply think "pizza." 😂🤷🏼‍♀
I love when your brother makes an appearance in your vids
Not gonna lie, I missed Shane and his goofiness
Did Shane go through puberty again?
loveeee
It’d be cool to do a series where you revisit old conspiracies!
I love this so much.
so are you guys gonna forget all about the racism, pedophilia, abt etc. ??
I’ve laughed sooooo many times, glad you’re back 😊
pushing 🅿️
You dont know how much I missed your snort and your humor 😭
Back for some more Clout huh? 💰🤑
PLEASE interview Jamie Lynn I know she would do it for the clout and it would be entertaining to hear her lie and then u could bring up all the reasons she’s wrong 🤍
The Jamie Lynn thing I CANNOT 🥲😂😂 we missed you and your train of thought
OMGGGG yass I’m so happpyy you are back this honestly made my day ❤️
✨Manifesting✨ 🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️
Aids awaits you
Shane done tell me after this whole time your gunna gunna fucking google it 🤣
P means money
I’ve been watching u since I was in MIDDLE SCHOOL (I’m 23 now) and I’ve always actually  laughed out loud to your videos. It’s nice to have u back 🖤
As a Philosophy student, I'm very excited for the conspiracy video!
Yayyyy you're back we love you Shane 💙.
This makes me so excited. I also never thought I would make it to this year. No idea why but that’s what I thought And poor Ryland, even though it was all jokes, seemed a bit startled with your dream
I hope for friends
I’d love to see more long conspiracy videos !! They make my day honestly and I just love them! Xx
I would literally die if you do a podcast all my time would be consumed by your podcast. Please do it
When you were talking about “in the future” I never related more
You don’t understand how happy seeing you post has just made me! A perfect watch before bed after a shitty day at work
Please do a podcast, we need it!
omg imagine a jamie-lynn video holy shit
my heart feels happy every time you apload. was literally having such a shit day today and finally had time to watch this video. you're so amazing and I love you so much. you my fav always and always have been. so so haoou you're finally back ❤
Now I gotta see you guys make pizza from scratch! Let’s test this theory!
Nooooo to the O. O'Reilly that is.
I just wanna be your friend my fellow cancer or let me read your zodiac chart🥺
I laughed so hard! At every single bit of this. I so get Shane's sense of humor, and I'm here for it. Why, because of been shitted on so much in my life, that whenever he said he didn't care what others thought and he was back, I felt that to my soul. Loved all of your outfits!
I hope the podcast will be with video🤗 like Rylands... I live it!
I missed both of you together. The fun was gone and now it's back.
L SHANE DAWSON
Laughing so hard I'm crying! Best video
Missed you shane ❤️
I love you so much Shane!! This has brightened my day!!
I don’t even care really. Im just happy to see you.
I haven’t laughed this hard since your last upload. There is no one like you Shane 😂🥰❤️
✨just because you say you’ve grown and changed doesn’t mean you have ✨
Omg, I really wish we were best friends 😂🖤
i hope u come back in full force.
Literally was cracking up every minute. Your kind of humor gets me every time. I miss these types of videos, not everything has to have a theme. Just you walking around your house and joking around with Ryland is entertaining enough 😁
The adhd in this video is living
Oh wow this was so boring and chaotic and uncomfortable. Shane is back at it again with sexual jokes again guys... Not a lesson learned.
I’ve missed your videos so much Shane! I’m so happy you’re back and finally doing what you love. You are so strong, I am so proud! ♥️
i enjoyed this
I used to love Shane n friends when I was like 13... i would love to hear what you have to share now
Shane you’re a genius, a very talented and funny human being, we’re not here just for your conspiracies, we’re here for you! I would loveeee to be your friend irl, you’re amazing
I love these types of videos they are my favorites!!!!
This is what i want, ALWAYS LOL
I was so depressed yesterday and today I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time. This made my day 🖤🌙
I have been watching you since "Fred is dead" I will always and forever love and support you! ❤️❤️
A podcast would make my life I miss you so much
Who told you to come back
we love this content :)
Oh, how I’ve missed these videos lol.  My friends sister & brother-in-law (K & B) are Ryland’s parents neighbors and so anyway, I saw pictures from when my friend and their daughter got to meet you guys a couple years ago, your mom was there too. It seemed like a lot of fun! Keep putting out these videos because I enjoy them every time! Glad to see you happy & to just see you being you!
“You guys get it” I do, I rlly do
Sorry but he who shall not be named needs to not be in these videos😅😅😅😅
personally i figured it out when i broke my hand, i got a pizzer and cut each slice with kitchen sizzers and even though it was a circle to being with when it came out of the over it didnt go back together.
Shane is free therapy
Hold up! $80 for 3 pizzas…???
I love your videos!!! You're hilarious and so are your friends!! Glad to see you back!!

Seems like he’s tryna get ahead of being canceled for the whole call her daddy Emma thing
why are all these comments so supportive??
I LOVE IT!!! I missed you so much Shane💛🥺 glad to see you and hear ur voice again:))
Wish I didn’t watch this, I feel so bad for Ryland. Dangling a future marriage is not funny. I watch Ryland Vlogs & the vlog might as well be called the Shane Seeking Attention show. Ryland and we deserve better.
Man I’ve missed this 🥺🥰❤️
I neeeeedddd more ghost hunting episodes! U should go back to the Stanley!
36:02 please tell me what you see in the background.
This is EXACTLY what I needed 💖
I laughed so hard watching this. I've missed you. 😂💕
YESSS I MISSED YOU SHANEEE
Shane's life: Accepting other people's theories as fact. 👌
There's an explanation... It's the slicer  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdypKKKQ8uA
i’m high af rn n my lungs and ribs hurt from laughing so hard
Ew
I missed this. I needed this.
I don’t think you understand how happy I am your back!! I love these videos and can’t wait to see the conspiracy videos x
Shane!!! I laughed so much ❤️ It’s the ✨🅿️✨ for me.
the “ p “ means pushing p, which means player, like playing people.
Bitch I would literally eat only dry toast for the rest of my life if it meant having the ENTIRE conspiracy/merch collection. I could only afford one of the makeup bags and it breaks my heart.
This was amazingggg I couldn’t stop laughing the whole vid😭🤍
So happy you’re back. Love watching your videos. Keep smiling xxx
LOL deserved
Not the click.bait title used knowing people still haven’t gotten answers to questions about how you’ve acted in the past.
I love Shane
so the Russia withdraw , Ukraine crisis it's ending!  America pandemic the end? America infection end? America debt crisis end?
This was so fun and enjoyable
I miss these types of videos from Shane🥺🥺
this sucks☠️
I felt it in my soul when Shane said about not making it to 2022 🤣 bitch, me too!! 😂😭🤣
Just “right pu$$y energy” for me the mercy is a must Shane!
YASS QUEEN #4 trending !!!!
You should be locked up and no one should let you out. Ever.
shane, do you have any idea how much we missed you? 🥺 so happy you are posting again
Omg i love you! Im soo happy your back 🥰❣️
Chuck E Cheese shouldn’t comment on this pizza fiasco. It only makes the situation more sketchy, when the employees or reps “comment” saying excuses that obviously aren’t true. “The pizza is made daily, in house” absolutely a bullshit. “The cutter is too heavy” OOOOKAY again, bullshit.
I really needed this today ❤️❤️❤️
This was the best!! Keep these types of videos comin!!
Let’s also talk about this video:  https://youtu.be/HFwzOfyqq8s  The pizza they made was PERFECTLY ROUND AND EVEN. #ChuckECheeseLies
HE’S BACKKKKK!!! YESSSSS🎉
I do not like the energy towards ryland in this video... he is so sweet and something about the relationship between shane and chris seems weird
Shane pls interview nikocado avocado
I love you Shane!!! So glad to see you happy and joking around
Not Jamie Lynn 😭😂
Legit when you posted your first video after the “ cancellation “ I cried happy tears cause I thought you would never be on the internet again :/
Look at the bottom to see if it’s baked uniformly 🍕
Was this video kind of pointless? Yes. Did I watch and love every second of it? Also, yes.
Yo! It’s like catching up with a friend!!! Good to have your dark humor back!!! ❤️
We miss you Shane and we love you 2022 is your year ❤️❤️
can’t wait for the vids i’m so happyy
If you do decide to sell the house, you have to do one last stay in the little room!
This is the Shane I love and missed yayyyyyyyyy :D
I just wanted to throw in ✨Saint Chris✨ as a nick name option 💗
nah get off of youtube
I dont think i have smiled and laughed so much watching a video in MONTHS lol Glad you are back!!!!
Omg the glorious chaos that is Shane is back. I love this video. I love your energy. Welcome back. Again. Xox
40:35 Chuckee, Ryland, and Jamie Lynn LMAO💀
Shane should run some clearance prices on your merch. Still too expensive or just the white pig backpack I want like make it real cheap bestie. Shane keep laughing it will all work itself out. Waiting for the next video.
LMAOO when he said "Cancel It" and showed the pic i was eating cereal and spit it all out LOL, made my day
So happy to see you happy shane ! You’re really blossoming and we can all see it! I love these silly videos that are all over the place ! Please do more, only if you’re comfortable ❤️🥰
At first when I saw the title of this video and the picture of Shane I thought something happened again and it was one of those tea spill drama videos lmaoo
I worked at a pizza shop for years!! Not the cutter I promise LOL
Hey Shane I figured out why the pizza looked like that ! So I always have a hard time cutting my home made pizza when it comes out Thea oven so what I started doing is cutting the pizza 🍕 before cooking it and when it comes out it looked like that on even lol try it out and you will see
It's the 🅿️ for me!
Order another pizza tell them to not cut the pizza. See if they will even agree to an uncut pizza
Loved this video so much, Haven't laughed so much in ages x
Hey Shane! I’m glad you’re back, i’ve been waiting forever for this video but I kept my patience because you whip up something entertaining and never disappoint 🙏
I could NOT stop smiling and laughing through this
Lemme tell you. I have not laughed this hard in SOOOOO LONG
43 minutes of nothing happening but freaking out over pizza and petty joke about not getting married fast enough. This is what passes off as content?
Ryland with the light “you’re doing great sweetie!” 😭😭🤣 I have missed this so much!! 🥺❤️🥰
I love you you should post more
Ily
I’m surprised you guys haven’t tried the Little Debbie ice cream.
The eye thing happens to me too but only when I cry… so I don’t 🤡🤪
Makes me so happy he's getting sued!
I haven't laughed this hard in forever 😂😂😂😂
U r so sick 😭 I need you off the internet
Shane… THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED 👏🏼
Is that the chuckee cheeses on fallbrook? I used to go as kid and my cousins dad played chuckie.
I loved this video so much Shane!!! I’m so happy you’re back on YouTube!!!!! 😭❤️❤️❤️
I loved this video.  I smiled and laughed the whole time.  Just what I needed.  By all means make more like this.  Welcome back!!🙂
I just want every day videos vlogs. Shane’s funny on the spot so he would do great on the vlog life.
literally nothing happens in the first ten minutes...
Everyone needs to *STOP* pretending like this guy Isn’t a -paedophile-  *STOP* normalising this sh#!…  What Is wrong with you kids?! WTF Is wrong with YouTube allowing this disgusting excuse of a human being, to still exist on Its platform?!
I laughed a lot. Welcome back!
Shane!! love you so much ! And it’s so great to see you doing so much better mentally!
...?
Hiii
I have missed you and your humor. Please post more Shane. Your humor really just brightened a really bad day for me ❤️
Yes please I would love to listen to your podcast!
I've missed you alot shane! You've been like a friend and a big brother for 10+ years
I'm so incredibly excited for your podcast shane!! Made my day to see you post again ❤🥰
glad to see you back shane
I love the urgent care in the background while Ryland eats the pizza lol
Shane!! The real you was all over this video so happy laughing joking and I loved it so so much I laughed so dam hard thank u! ♥️
I've been watching since I was 13; I'm in college now. I'm glad to see you posting again, even after all of the drama. The cancel culture sucks; it seems as though you have to get validation from everyone nowadays. Although some people were canceled for good reasons, you just needed to face music head-on and accept what you did, then take the time and reflect. I can see that you've grown a lot, and I am incredibly proud of you. Keep being you, Shane, because no one else can. Why can't some people understand that we are all human and make stupid mistakes? That's the whole point of life, right? Why can't forgiveness be a part of that? Anyways, I'm glad that you're back, and I cant wait to see what you bring us. Welcome back Shane
Okay so my friend used to work at Chuck E. Cheese and he told me he knows the answer for the weird pizzas. They make several and cut them all up. Since a lot of small children go there, they usually serve slices of pizzas, so there is a lot of pizzas in the back that only have a few slices taken out. So when someone orders a whole pizza, they put the mismatched slices together and reheat it as a whole pie. So technically…. you’re right. it’s just not served out to kids and then brought back, as least at his location
I love this Shane!!! Jus amazing vibez !!❤️
Wait... you have a WAREHOUSE of inventory?? Make a website and gimme please ❤️ we still love you shane
I lovvvve these random vlogs!
sooo many controversial things said in this video. you literally havent changed at all. no need to make jokes about your parnters body or race.
How can Chuck E Cheese have the audacity to sue Shane when he’s making such a valid point😂😭
Ryan never comes across well in Shane videos ..
Adam & Eve
I’m so happy Shane posted, the video is great honey keep up the great work. Also, I can vouch that I’d wear tpe merch un ironically
i missed shane’s humor
fred is dead is the first video i ever watched in youtube. i’ve been watching you ever since, at-least 15 years. i’m so glad you’re back 😭😭😭
Trade Sanctions “We do not want to attack China on sensitive issues like organ harvesting, but I really think we should, because organ harvesting is really a very blunt attack on basic human rights,” van Dalen explained. “It’s too much talking about trade, about money, and not enough about human rights and the rights of minorities.”  After being accused of committing genocide in its treatment of the Uyghurs, the CCP imposed retaliatory sanctions against European politicians. The EU responded by suspending its investment plan with China.   van Dalen welcomes this decision and hopes that such initiatives continue until the CCP stops its human rights violations. “We should use this as a whip stick to make clear to China that the violation of human rights is important,” he said. In fact, known CCP violations are not just limited to forced organ harvesting; rather, they involve a wide range of human rights abuses.   van Dalen warned EU countries to pay attention to what is going on in China. He emphasized that business people or medical professionals should be alert to the situation in China, especially the forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience. In the meantime, he has been working hard to bring this topic back to the European Parliament’s agenda.   Annick Ponthier, Member of Parliament (MP) from Belgium, attended the forum. In an interview, she said that such a message needs to be passed to the politician circle and that she would work on this alongside her colleagues. MP Ponthier believes that forced organ harvesting in China is also an important issue for Europe and that human rights should be safeguarded across political venues.
Luke 15:10 In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.  Matthew 3:8 Do those things that will show that you have turned from your sins.  Acts 3:19 Repent, then, and turn to God, so that He will forgive your sins.  Luke 17:3 So watch what you do! “If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him."
How comes Shane is not making any more ghost videos?
I used to work for Chuck E Cheese and I know exactly why the pizza looks the way it does, you guys -almost- came to the right conclusion. It’s not sketchy, and I’m pretty sure you and I are almost neighbors (hello Calabasas fam) so if you want a demonstration hmu! 😂 I guarantee I can show you why. It’s really simple. And may have a little bit to do with how they hire 🙃
Best way to get pulled out of depression! Thanks guys!
Did you know that when you take out life insurance they actually ask if you eat Chucky cheese…
Absolutely loved this! 😃 Haven’t laughed out loud so much at a video in a long time! 😂 can’t wait for your podcast and for you to start making more videos again!! ☺️
Love this Shane we sure did miss you
i havent laughed this hard in a long time!!! put vids out and ill watch them idc❤✌🏻
Haha I love ryland  Mayb the pizza is bi sectional 😉😉
I wore my Shane merch religiously hoping one day you would post and my prayers were answer this made my day 😊
My whole heart is filled with happinesssss!! I could scream. Its the comeback for me. You're missed and very welcomed back Shane!!!!❤❤❤
79 for a dead pig head purse ikyfl
Shaneeee we reallyyyyy need moree conspiracy theories! Lots of loveeeee.😩❤
i feel bad for ryland for some reason.
Biggest smile on my face right now!! Welcome back :)
Matthew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach his message: “Turn away from your sins, because the Kingdom of heaven is near!”  Proverbs 28:13 You will never succeed in life if you try to hide your sins. Confess them and give them up; then God will show mercy to you.
Yes can we get more Random Adventures like this....this was 👍
Oh my god I need to go see a psychic
all the people here being positive are gross. shane is disgusting.
SENOR POOHHH i am dead
Love you Shane ❤️ this was hilarious!
Wow it really IS Chuck E. Cheese’S!!! So with the S. Mandelaaaa
I AM HERE FOR IT, ALWAYS HAVE.
Absolutely loved every bit of this! <3 missed these shane jokes
So happy that you're back Shane 🥳❤
❤️❤️❤️
these comments look so fake 😂
2 Corinthians 4:1-3 1Therefore, since God in His mercy has given us this ministry,a we do not lose heart. 2Instead, we have renounced secret and shameful ways. We do not practice deceit, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by open proclamation of the truth, we commend ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God. 3And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.
Glad you’re back!!❤️🤗
These comments are absolutely morbid. What is the hell is wrong with you all? Shane is a monster and he will always stay a monster because of all the things he did.
Missed you Shane
Shane waiting until YouTube disables dislikes so he can post a vid
dude really thought he could just... comeback?
Your videos are one of the few that make me audibly crack up. I’ve missed seeing you be happy :) Glad you’re doing well and creating again
yeah....about the not thinking you'll make it to 2022 thing... the girls who get it, get it and the girls that don't, don't
I would want to run into you if you had a Disneyland adventure 🙈🤣 welcome all shane videos haha
YES THIS IS WHAT WE WANT, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT IS WHAT YOU WANTED TO MAKE. DONT FEEL PRESSURED TO ONLY MAKE SPECIFIC GENRE VIDEOS. I LOVED WATCHING THIS AND I WILL WATCH ANYTHING YOU MAKE, YOU ARE JUST SO ENTERTAINING BEING YOURSELF :)
Why are all of these positive???
cant u ask for the pizza to be .... not ...slized? :3
I haven’t laughed this hard in so long, thank you so much 😭 KEEP POSTINGG🤍🤍🤍
I love you
neededddd moreeeee
SHANE!!! I have missed you. I am so glad you are back. STAY HAPPY! We love you.
We’re promoting childish behavior once again. Way to go Bro
shane is so amazing i- i cant
🅿️
So glad you are back. I’ve watched all of your videos and I’ve missed them and you❤️
I literally laughed harder than I have in a long time! ❤️ you Shane!
Things I like about this comeback: -Angelika Oles' commentary to that  - - - - - - That's it. Nothing more.
I smiled and laughed through this entire video! Glad to have you back I missed you! I have had a real rough week and this video mixed with your humor gave me the mental break Ineeded. Thank you Shane glad to have you back. ❤ Chuck E Cheeses Pizza shape makes absolutely no sense..
This video is so P 😂
I am SO happy you are back. The world has become a judgemental place that offers no second chances.. media is becoming crazy and times are changing, for better and worse. You’re a good guy Shane, and I can’t wait to see what’s coming!!
i think its because chuck e cheeses often sells pizza by the slice so they probably give you pizzas that have a few slices sold seperately, and they just fill in the gaps yknow? like frankensteining a pizza, but not USED pizza
You should order a pizza and ask them not to cut it
Shane saying he has a list of videos but probs won’t upload for another three months
This is so 🅿️
*Okay, but TPE merch needs to happen 🤣🤣🤣*
Seńor Pooh took me tf out
Yes yes yes 1,000 times YES!!!  PLEASE DO A PODCAST AGAIN!
33:23 was literally you to drew 🤭
Omg I've missed this so much!! Please come back and just do whatever the hell you want cause I honestly would watch all of it! 🤣
Missed him so bad
You know what? I think I'm going to give Shane a second chance. He's made bad jokes in the past yes but it was over 10 years ago and I truly think he's changed. I'm also happy to see that I'm not seeing as many negative comments as I usually do. I love you Shane, I'm glad to see you back
pass away
OMGG YOUR BACKK IM SO HAPPY OMG OMG OMG OMG
yesss please give us more videos & a podcast you guys seems so much happier n a better space !! your new office is amazing & you don’t need to doubt yourself you’re amazing ❤️
SHANE, PLS STAY THIS TIME. NEVER GO AGAIN !!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Missed you Shane, hope you're doing great ❤️
I’m happy your doing videos again I hope we meet in person one day🥺🥺
I missed seeing you been here since you started!
This is so funny 🤣 love this
❤️
I love how Ryland went full annoyed mom mode when ordering the pizza
18:40 I get it 😩🤣😆  20:48 when mainstream uses AAVE 😩💀  20:20 "Chuck E stop!" 26:08 37:05 🤣  32:20 🍕 Shane turned into the Tin Man 😭💀
You guys should definitely get married at Chuck. E Cheese!!😍🙌🤭💍💍🐀🍕
Please please call your podcast Tight P***Y Energy
Maybe chuck e precuts the pizza before cooking them cos the pieces would cook unevenly and explain the misfits 🤷🏻‍♀️😂
Rylands feels are genuinely hurt.
Real pizza dough is misshapen
This video made my day! Totally needed this. Thanks Shane! ❤️
Omfg great ass timing!!!! I’m so happy you’re getting back into this. I’m getting lasek surgery in March. So I hope you’ll get the first podcast up soon, so I can listen to it during my recovery 😱😱😱
I HAVE MISSED YOU SO FUCKING MUCH THANK GOD YOUR BACK ❤️❤️❤️
Shane could do nothing and I’d watch him all day he’s literally so funny ! And him and ryland are the cutest🥰
Shane I really missed you! Please do not stop posting. You are one of my favorite YouTubers and I love getting a notification when you post.
To be honest, I think Chucky's should personally take Shane and his crew in to show him their pizza making process so that we can all see exactly why they are so misshaped and end it once and for all on a positive for both sides.  also though, definitely make more conspiracy videos :)
i would lke to see more accountability
SHANE! The nicest surprise ever. I’m so happy you’re back! I wish you and you’re entire family the BEST!  Btw, TPE!!! I’ll buy it. I’d totally buy tight P energy merch!
"... You still have your odd shapes, but so do I." 💀🤣
So disappointed in you honestly and yes I came here just to comment that
This is exactly what we wanted! Your goofy self! You seem happier and motivated and I cant wait for your podcast and for you to start filming more content again. Honestly this is exactly what i missed- just randomness and you being crazy with Ryland and "Christopher Robin". Also super excited for the conspiracy theory videos to make a rise again. 🍕🐷 👽🇲🇽🧸
The acoustics in this video is HORRIBLE!!!! I couldn’t do more than 4 minutes it’s so bad-
So happy to see you back Shane!
MY FAVORITE QUEEN ON THE INTERNET IS BACK !!!

The ego took over the body

I’m so happy to see you!!!  Thankyou for always being you, Shane 🧡
Ily queennnnnn
Yess omg I’m so happy your back
I heard this from a third party… The pizza is pre cooked, pre sliced, in a bag. The employees take slices out of a bag and warm them in whatever appliances they have (probably toaster ovens), and try to make them fit in a circle.  The employee who shared this information also said there was a real pizza oven that had a ton of dust on it, so it probably had never been used. Also, that person was actually under age at the time they worked there but wasn’t asked for id. They also said that employees are emailed to not be at work during specific hours and that’s when they refill the freezers with the frozen pizza. There are small slices because sometimes they need to cut the frozen slices to fit in the toaster.
I would love to see some conspiracies I’ve been obsessed with those lately. Also I’ve been missing Shane a lot❤️
Welcome back Shane!!
I want to sue you for playing me 😭😂 good vid tho!
i am SICK of you guys. forgiving him? he hasn’t changed. he never will
Trust me, we love these types of videos too!!
Another 30 minutes of awkward sexual talk.
I miss your old ratchet food videos TOO 🥺
I love videos like this, we want this too! This made my day!!! ♥️
Bipolar
Shane! I can’t wait for your new podcast!!! I loved the one you had with Lauren and then Shane and friends. You should add Chris as a co-host or a segment or something. You guys are funny and have great chemistry! I can’t wait!!! 😆
Shane I love you sooo much thank you sooo much for doing videos again and just to say you are the reason that I’m still here today I would come home everyday and immediately watch your videos sooo thank you sooo much luv you
10:04 LMFAOO hahahahaha
Of course I am always thrilled when you upload, however I much much much prefer these videos over conspiracy theories. They scare me, I cannot watch them haha
When I tell you I laughed, omg, I was CRYING! I have missed this energy so much!!! Shane , MARRY THAT BOY!!
shane can you do more ghost hunting videos please!!!!!
Conspiracy videos gonna be interesting in this new era 😅
At Chuck E. Cheese, just ask for a pizza that isn’t sliced👍. For safety reasons…. or something 😂
Shane u are the most amazing person, u have helped a lot of people though difficult times, me too. I love your videos and can't wait to see more of you and the guys. Please keep going even though those difficult times, just know that we all support you and we will always be there for u. Be the funny and thoughtfull person u are, and don't listen to those who say otherwise. Much love from Norway btw❤
Crying but not dying inside anymore bc you finally posted a video!!! I love y’all !!
Sooooo happy you are back. I was in tears laughing and wanting a banana cream crumbl all at the same time. It is a bit bittersweet you are selling your house that you were so happy to be in.  Welcome back!
I really don’t think he is kidding about the republican part….
Man seek help...:/
shane i love you #4 trending. this we needed 😘
Shane, do whatever the fahk you want, we’ll always love you 🖤🖤🖤
i was having such a shitty day and then i saw you posted and it instantly put a smile on my face. thank you shane.
I LOVE LEAN 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Love these videos shane ❤
It’s so nice to see a video on your channel again. I missed laughing with you guys ❤️ On a different note, have you seen Archive81? It’s a new horror Netflix mini series, I think y’all would like it!
Seriously though, it doesn't make sense that the slices don't match!
i love these types of videos please do more <3
This is literally one of the best videos on Youtube ever!
I’m so happy he’s back 😭😭😭
Shane is so freaking funny
1:28 won’t even lie. i was so happy when i saw you posted 😭
Ryland wearing the dress looks like eleven from stranger things
Seeing you back and happy made me cry. I sobbed knowing that the person who helped me out of a dark and scary time is starting to become whole again and do what he loves. Thank you for being you ❤️
❤️❤️
😂❤️
Your all about the p actually means your all about the money. It’s not a nice phrase like rylan said. Basically it means you will do anything for and dollar because your desperate.
Yooooo this video ☠️😂😂 oh Shane I missed you 😂💕
SHANE! I have a crazy idea. You should give your LA house away to a lovely, loyal, got your back always, dedicated, did I say loyal? Fan of yours… me. I’m that fan, you should just give me and my family your house. I make peanuts for money but I promise to continue using my pig backpack, conspiracy and controversy palettes, AND I will come to your wedding ;) lol
It's the cutter and the uneven dough that is made in house. Former employee
Remember when he did Black Face?
Remain blessed special person
Counter Theory what if we are all in an anime and when we hear those conscious thought maybe just maybe those thoughts everyone else can hear that's watching our TV show because an anime you can hear the anime characters thoughts sometimes so we could be in an anime
The urgent care in front of Chuck E Cheese 👁👄👁
Ilysm shane
I haven't laughed out loud in such a long time. :)
I am a 40 year old piggy housewife that needed this!!! Thanks for the laughs Shane!! I am so glad you are back and thriving!❤
New content!! HUZZAH!
We love a Marvel king
i would love to come to shanes wedding i stg id enjoy it
Oh my god! I missed this! 😭😭😭
Hey Shane, I just wanna say that I’ve always been a supporter of yours and love all the vids you make old and new glad to have you back
I have never laughed so hard that through this video 😂. Glad to have you back Shane 😊
I hate that you are so saddened with the beauty room.     I waited for so long for the merch . And still want it all especially that palette. It’s amazing. And everyone can screw off if they doubt that
Why dont you order one that's not pre cut and specifically ask for it and see what they say THIS IS JUST A SUGGESTION BUT YEA I THINK ITD BE FUNNY
I wanted to ask a while back you made a video of your house being haunted is there a part two to that video? Your video that was recently posted was funny and you made my day!
I have re watched this vlog like 3x now ❤️ so excited to have Shane back on YT! We’ve all missed you tons❤️
Your voice has changed You have kinda changed but I love Shane so it’s like whatever ☺️
I’m sorry but the constant “disclaimer” pop up freaking sent me 🤣
I just love you. Always have and always will and I am SO stoked for another podcast! I listened back in the day. Hell I remember when it was just YouTube and you had a call line where we could leave you messages back in like 2010. I left one then explaining how you’d saved me more than once. I just don’t have words to say how amazing it is to see you back
lmao the fucking urgent care in the background
I clicked on this video and a dominos add popped up….even YouTube knows the real tea about Chuckie
this video is so fucking funny. i never stopped laughing during this whole video!
I miss your food content🥺💕💕💕
tell me why i was CACKLING at this by myself in my room
"Traditional or stuffed crust?" Shane: "A mix." I was crying laughing.
Your videos honestly brighten my day, Shane. Thank you.
3 large pizzas cost you 80 dollars????????

Dangelo Wallace brought me here!!!! I love his and Shane’s collab together look it up!!!!!
Can you send me some twizzlers? I have none in my country
KING YESSSSSS
You should do a podcast for sure if that makes you happy. But, maybe on that gets edited or at least screened before release. I know you don't hold any truly awful views, but you do go down some rabbit holes with jokes, and I think you should have a safety net in place just in case. I want you to be successful.
i am laughing so hard at your sad little gremlin face in the thumbnail 😭
Shane  your  video  was  really   fun  to  watch  you should  do  more  video   ereveyone  well really  like  it  👍
I was watching your other old videos a few days ago awwww, thankkkkk youuuuuuuuu
I've been a fan of yours for like a decade, Youtube is so boring without you, i'm so happy to have you back Shane!!!! <333
I made it to like, 12-13 minutes and gave up. I can't believe I ever enjoyed watching this crap.
Ok but the Chuck E. Cheese pizza … have they actually been open for indoor dining to have pizza left by others? Some places in LA have still been takeout only
YESSSS. This video gave the the mega dose of Seratonin that my depressed brain needed! We love you SHANE, and I cannot wait to see more videos! (Going through some traumatic sh*t right now) and just the thought of the laughs and giggles your videos bring me every god damn time is just what I need right now. Thankyou for being you 💕  Ps: EMIT YOUR TIGHT P*SSY ENERGY TO THE WORLD🤪
You looked me dead in my soul when you said "we get it"
Omg from min 1 I was laughing so much that my stomach hurt thank you for that shane I laughed not like this in mouth love you 🥰
blended family💀💀 please
nothing says ‘i’ve changed’ like doing the exact same video you did prior to being cancelled???
Not the taco bell ad rolling before your video lmao so on brand
omg shane i missed your videos sm!!! glad you're making more :)
Maybe compare their pizza with another pizza company but order the same order with the same places
I was at a really low place since 2020 and I just wanna point out that your conspiracy videos and creepy ones have made MY LIFE, I come back to your channel every now and then to see how your doing, you seem happier and healthy<3 ty
Dude we like whatever you put out. You don’t have to feel restricted to just one type of content 😊
This was exactly what I needed today !!!thank you Shane …
SHANE !!!! Happy to have you back!!! Don’t worry about not having a conspiracy theory video yet because even these kind of videos is so much fun when I watch them and you are fucking hilarious and I love you so much so keep on doing whatever you want because I’ll watch it anyway I love you so much take care of yourself💜💜🙏🏻
This had me laughing hysterically 🤣
"doesn't look like the same pie" he ain't wrong
hilarious. damn i missed this. "should i give the pizza a covid test?" BRILLIANT
i never trusted this guy and it shows he's all talk must be a gay thing
I’m laughing through this whole video 😂😂 Shane you really made my day! 💛💛
This was soo funny
PLEASE DO A PODCAST SHANE!!
Get back to Colorado quick. Hate the fact your in LA. We want to see new life not old life.
conspiracy's and pornstars yes lol
Oh my fucking god, I am HOWLING , missed you
Ugh I missed him so much haven’t watched him in so long  He’s the funniest😂😂❤️❤️
i will never understand why the pizza looks like that
I LOVE the fact that I have the same sense of humor as him 😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️💐
Thats called auditory hallucinations or schizophrenia
I honestly don't care if Shane is ever canceled. He is a part of me growing up and that's the point, we all grow. We change and learn everyday. Keep up the good work Shane, I'll be here to support you.
I saw a UFO 2 wks ago and reported it. The Chief Director of Mufon emailed me and is calling to discuss the details on what I saw. This could be interesting!
i missed your videos so much, truly the light we need in this world
Shane:  Colorado made me republican! 🤣😂😅  Me with my MAGA loving history teacher who shows us Fox News every morning: -_-
Why you tube didn't notify me thi video when I have the bell on???
I can’t with the Chuck E. Cheese protection disclaimers lmao
This video has 🅿️ written all over it!
At the beginning of the video, I believe the same thing and think about it often. Weird!!
we don’t want you back x
LOVE THIS!!!!
Do the podcast. I love it and think about it all the time. Try not to censor yourself. We love unfiltered Shane.
Will we ever see your mom in another video again?????
I could understand the half and half pizzas being kinda wonky, cause maybe they just cut a pepperoni pizza in half and a cheese in half and then combine those 2 pizzas together to save time with orders. But the only cheese or only pepperoni still looking off is concerning😅😂  But loved this video!😂
Finally your back😂I watched all of morgans and rylands videos love u all💗💗💗
youre literally the funniest person on youtube i am NOT kidding
“A call from my lawyer.. I’ll call him from prison.” IM SCREAMING
Love the Republican joke-A Republican
Yes podcast 😩🥰
I never got rid of your palette, and I missed you. Cancel culture blows- growing up is literally evolving and changing and making mistakes and learning. Anyone who condemned you was probably far from perfect.   Glad you’re back and doing well!
MAKE THE PODCAST!!! Omg omg omg!!!
"due to local laws we are not allowed to scoop up our pizza off the floors" 💀
When Shane was sitting in the car talking about the pizza and trying not to get sued by Bestie Chuck E. It reminded me of iCarly the tech foot episode😂
I want more.
Is his podcast only on IG?
I face planted running to this video so fast
Just do more videos , please
The Queen is back 💅🏼
i haven’t laughed at a youtube video in idk how long until now
It's Pushin P y'all lmao, there's a song called that, that's where the trend came from
i missed youuuu😡
Hey Shane, I don’t know if you remember me but at the start of 2020, I’d commented about a conspiracy about birth marks and how they could be about how we could of possibly died in a life before. ANYWAYS I’ve missed your videos so much and I generally can’t wait for your podcast!! I missed you loads and your sense of humour is still the same possibly even funnier. I loved this video loads can’t wait to see the next one !!
I don't know what crumbles are but we need them in canada! I will totally jump off the wagon for one- or 6 of these!
i'm just sad YouTube decided to monetize him again. not a good move. not taking accountability.

Personally, I don't care for podcasts.  But if you post it on youtube I might actually watch it.
I’m so happy to see you making content again! I’m having surgery in a few weeks and I missed your videos
so happy haters lost. good to c you back Shane.
Love this video 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥵🥵
I'd go to your wedding!!!
Merch yes merch you need merch now
The world is healing, shane is back
This was low key a conspiracy video but didn't wanna label as a conspiracy video to avoid a lawsuit 🤣😅
maybe they cut the pizza and place them in the "buffet area" and if people order pizza, they get it from the "buffet area"...enough to make a pizza from the pizza already made. make sense? maybe lol at Sbarro pizza in the park meadows mall, they cook pizza and put they in a waiting area. sometimes when half the pizza is gone they throw it with another half to save pans. this is a long comment holy shit lol good vid
Maybe just a thought, order a pizza whole, with no cuts....? If they messed that up, then you know...   They just suck at making pizza
I’m going to be completely honest here… Back when Shane was at the peak of his career…which in my opinion was for years at a time. With podcasts, conspiracy videos, food videos etc. he was amazingly hilarious and brought great joy into my life and I looked forward to watching him every night after a hard day at work. It was literally therapeutic for me to put on a Shane video. Now years later, at 29 years old, this new video is unbearable to watch. That being said I feel that this style of video, his “humor” was of a certain time that just doesn’t hit now. It’s just a lot and hard to watch.
Always enjoy your content!
🅿️
This is the epitome of #awkward
Naaa ill stick to dominos little caesars rosatis
I LOVE YOU
Loved it! 💕 glad to be seeing your videos again!
Happy you are back Shane!
Cancelled anonymous is an amazing idea for a podcast.
So chaotic I love it,
Was Ryland going to make a P joke about Shane spitting and urinating in a cup near the end of the video? 😂😂😂
Lmao I loved the beginning, “until then” 😅
If they heat up that old pizza and serve it hot I'll eat it. The heat should kill the germs. Props for not being wasteful 😅 though in seriousness there should be transparency about stuff like that. I just really wanna eat pizza right now...
Please do a Disneyland video!!!!
love the fact shane isnt making dark/self-derogatory jokes anymore... hope ur doing well my dude x
Clickbait Title and thumbnail for this…disappointed
Before the crust cools, and "sets" it can scrunch up, especially if it's a bit soggy. Leading to different slices.
I miss the vlogs of you going to theses other YouTubers and changing lives with them or getting  beautified by them an other stuff
I laughed so much during this who video! I miss these videos of you just being you!!! Keep ‘em coming! Love you ❤️
Adopted from the third party 😂
Bruh why is this video so good
Shane listening to Rylan willing to eat the CC  pizza..... 👀😬😬😬 this is why we still not married
I’m dying laughing so hard at the pizza scene. He’s so fast with his commentary on his body shapes being different like the slices😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
👂⏰🗣️Mathew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luke 3:7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Luke 3:8 Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to  say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. Flee eternal hell🔥 repent of your sins . There is forgiveness  only in  Jesus Christ, no other name is given under heaven that man may be saved. He  died and is now risen at the right hand of God and he makes intercession. Only in him my Lord Jesus Christ is salvation found.  Rom10:9 👂 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼. Jesus Christ is God in the flesh. Came  to destroy the works of the devil.  God commands every man to repent and  beleive the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Flee eternal hell🔥.  He saved me from all my sins and forgave me. I have eternal life only because he died and now is risen at the right hand of God and he ever lives to make intercession for us.⏰🥰😊🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼⏰⏰⏰👐🕯️🙏🏼🥺👂⏰🗣️ The way is narrow and difficult the way. Enter you at the straight gate. If you say you are a Christian but are living like an unbeliever or a devil. You more than likely are not one , you are deceiving your self and other. But there is grace to the one who comes to God through Jesus Christ 🙏🏼.  It will be the end of your self will  and sinful passions, but at the end is eternal life.  There is no sin that Jesus Christ can't deliver you from. So go to him and quit hiding your sins , tell him and beg him to set you free from them.  He did it with me the chief of sinners. Now I am walking in victory by grace☝🏿☝️ alone
I’m so glad you’re back!!
Happy your back Shane don't make it to long this time ❤
Glad you back ❤️
I hate looking at this comment section and seeing so many people in support of Shane
I worked for CEC in high school lol and they use the long pizza cutter that’s like a seesaw! It jacks the pizza up if you have no idea how to use it & if you’re doing it fast. We didn’t blend pizza’s when I worked there!!
We adore you, fam❤️❤️❤️❤️
No matter the shape of the pizza the slices should fit back together?????
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates~🎈
As boring as always
Shane!! I love all your videos, as long as you’re happy with what you’re filming it doesn’t matter! most people just love seeing you happy doing whatever you love:)
I enjoyed it, I have also rewatched at least three times everything from the last five years. I think all the ones with Jeffree Star were outstanding. Looking forward to your future output.
shane i love you so much i’m so glad you’re back!! and i fucking love the kill bill shirt that’s my favorite movie😭 but fr i’m so excited to see what’s to come from you. ❤️
$80 for three pizzas? I hate California 😒
OMG I FUCKEN MISSED YOU 🤍
Chris Crumble
Shane!!!!
I really want to know what Chucky cheese would say/do if you went in there with the unbeaten pizzas and been like: uhhh I’m sorry but is there something wrong with my pizza? They don’t match at all. They give their bullshit explanation and you’re like: no but like… there are gaps and why are some pieces longer than the rest? 🤔
call him chris crumble
This is the content we are still here for 😁
the amount of disclamers madw me die of laughter
The queen is back
Shaneeeeee we’ve missed you!!! Please keep on posting content. We love you and glad you’re back!
You make my stressful college days so much better! xoxo I love you guys!
Shane: I’m goi g to sit down. You can sit down to baby  Ryland: EXCUSE ME!  Shane: you’re already sitting 😂😂😂
You be you. That's y I subscribed and stay subscribed enjoyed the video
I think the workers dont know how to cut pizza, so they just cut it all uneven.
lol its the chucky for me
so happy to see your videos again, shane :)
Ryland getting frustrated on the phone kills me lmao 🤣
welcome back SHANE <3 miss your vids i was watching your vids when you were still on the old house
I'm just so happy to see you on YouTube again Shane Iv missed you
Someone should order one typical pizza and then one super customized pizza and then compare the shapes
Omg.. when I can tell when you guys filled this based off the crumbl cookie options… lol
The podcast better be on YouTube and not whatever the fuck it was on before!!
WOULD LOVE A PODCAST (and a video podcast like The Sip would be fucking incredible 💗)
I love this new Shane ❤️❤️
Repulsive
I cried laughing the ENTIRE TIME😂😂😂😂 welcome back?♥️

I fucking love this humor and its 43 minutes, I cant  🤣
$80 on FUCKED UP PIZZA?  Great to have you back Shane!
I fucking love youuuuuuuuu
I 🖤 U Shane! I’ve been watching since middle school & I’m in college now (-:
“if you’re watching this video, you get it” i couldn’t agree more shane
this had me laughing out loud
37:23 check ☑️
Shane.... I absolutely LOVE your podcast idea!! I would literally listen to it over and over again. Your voice is so soothing 😌  I can really see that you're in a better place, it radiates off of you. It makes me feel so good. I am so happy for you. I am so excited to see what else you are gonna create in the future. I will be there every step of the way!!
I LOVE YOU SHANE 🧡🧡🧡
Why is it Shane and rylan being weird I feel bad for rylan
Bi, I'm bi, bi ,bi.... buy my merch  Amazing plug haha
Ryland is an Otter, Shane could totally be a Bear!! Nothing wrong with either! (Says the straight female from Jersey) 🤣
Shane’s editing remains unmatched.  So funny and quick! Always a fan
yayyyy im happy u uploadedd
I have always been a Shane Dawson Stan from his early years making comedy skits to his conspiracy theories and all through his cancel phases I have always loved him and so glad he's back and trending and the haters are quaking at the return the queen
HA!
I needed this today!
I used to work at Chuck E. Cheese when I was in high school. 2003-2007. The pizza used to do that when I made it sometimes. The reason is all about placement of the cutting tool. It’s a big like half sphere knife. So if you don’t slice it perfectly the pieces on one side may be smaller in another spot. Each pizza has a certain amount of slices. So you may not cut each one perfect. Also it’s a lot of teenagers working there and they usually don’t care if they cut the pizzas perfect.
I loved it Shane thank you i laught very hard
Okay but why did this make me crave Chuck E. Cheese pizza?
I love this video and love that you're here with all your soul and so glad you're making content that you enjoy that's what is it all about. Love you so much shane
i genuinely live for these videos. i love seeing them happy and at such a better state than before! love you guys.
Bitch I’m dead 😂
do a covid conspiracy video plzzz
omg we missed you so freaking much!! just happy to see you being your hilarious self💜
I believe in a shane redemption arc bc of this. I actually mimicked his sense of humor and I love/hate it LOL
We should get Gordon Ramsey on the case🤣
Maybe they cut it before baking it?
This isn’t what we asked for but good god. This is what we needed. Funniest video yet! Love it shane. Can’t wait for the podcast❤️
32:30 😂😂😂
Soooo, why did this video end up being sort of click-baity.... A recycled concept with random jokes and laughter.... 😓😓😓 #masterofdisguise lol
Lol Ryland meant the “least straight thing” you can do is have sex lol. Not the least gay thing, Lol. Cause the desire to eat out and finger is in straight men obviously but if you are gay that desire won’t really be there.
I miss these silly conspiracies! You have genuinely made my day better by uploading. Thank you, it's awesome to have you back❤
This is our wedding had me 💀🤣
How fun would it be to hear Shane interview formerly canceled celebs/YouTubers/etc. on his podcast?!  I’d listen to every episode.
“We are so happy you took a break, you seem much happier now “  Did y’all forget he took a break because the internet hated him?🤨 because he abused minors and make sexual jokes about r^ping his animals and asked kids to twerk. No matter how many comments he deletes, people will still remember him for that. Always
Dude you still sound like Acreep
I laughed so fucking hard. Glad you’re back!
MatPat figured out why their pizza looks weird. It’s the cutters they use and the fact they rarely sharpen them.
Lol  Rylan: these ones were adopted from a 3rd party….for sure  -me at all family gatherings-
I got a whole lot in just the first 5 minutes LMAO
Not Jamie lynn! 😭😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
trying to be logan paul huh?
Why is Shane sad about the house
Shane: "I'm gonna make a Chuck E cheese redemption video and show everyone how the company has improved the pizzas. Chuck E cheese: "Nope!"
SHANE I LOVE YOU IN SO HAPPY YPU ARE BACK THIS MADE MY WHOLE WEEK AAAAA❤️❤️💐💐💐
I missed you so much ❤️ you’re still the same Shane I loved when I was 10 years old….. I’m 20 now
God is real
This video is perfect! I love that you’re back! We have missed you!!!
Shane god bless you I use to think that god is real
Aye
SO EXCITED TO FINALLY BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN AND WATCH THIS 💖✨
OMG I love how you are exactly as odd as me!!! 😂 You rock, man! I enjoyed every minute of this video 👌🏻
Okay so no accountability cool
You say we didn't want this, but I promise we did. 😭 Cannot wait for the podcast!!!
@8:22 LAUGHED ME ASS OFFF!
shane almost getting sued by chuckie cheese, then doing another video making fun of them once again lmao
I love how there’s an urgent care right behind them
Bro aged 50 years
I’ll say, I don’t think the pizza is recycled but as someone who used to work at a pizza place (pizza my heart) that also sold slices sometimes we would just put another one on to make the full pizza, I think they just use slices that are already precut
has anyone here worked at chuck e. cheese and can answer this mystery for us
Shane I'm so so freaking happy that your back!!! I've waited forever. I've watched his shows since the first uploads and it's been a long and interesting ride. He grew up just like me and we're the same age so it was always like growing up with a wonderful friend. Plus omg marry Ryland I'm dying to see that queen rock a dress and I can't wait to see how you two do your wedding 😁😁😁
Swear Ryland is high as a kite in this and I’m here for it
So funny!
I not going to lie watching this made me feel better (after food poisoning)
the fact shane is the most distracted person i’ve ever seen 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Okay so they're different sizes as when they cut the pizza as its fresh dough and it'll have different densitys throughout the pizza so once it's cooked and cools each slice would settle differently once it begins to cool, causing some slices to be smaller or bigger than the rest.. plus I imagine the cheese would have contributed to that fact as you are cooking out the moisture so it would dry smaller than the cheese before and more firm contorting the size of the pizza and as it cools after its been sliced. And  it could contribute to the mishapen slices...also other stores have they're dough made in factory's while chucke cheese does it in store which could further effect the prossess as far as shape and densitys of each slice... its weird but can be explained. Glad you're back Shane 💞
Shane , your videos always make my day. Thank You 🙏♥️
Gosh I missed him. The energy he brings is amazing
I can not with that pizza !
I love everything you upload Shane!! No matter how edited, raw, specific or random your videos are they are always a joy to watch! I'm so glad to see you doing better 💛💛💛 lots of love from a fan who's been here since literally forever!!! Love u xx
Yes yes yes yes yes!!!!! I LOVE the podcast idea! Conspiracy ideas especially. But anything really. I'm so freaking excited!
Chris talks like kiki from 20 something Austin lol
So excited for the theory videos. :) I’ve missed you.
Loved this so much! Replaying 💓
This killed me 🤣🤣🤣🤣😭👌🏽😭 I cant, I miss laughing at a video. Finally no more eggshells
Missed these! Love all the positive 2022 energy!!
As a Crumbl employee, absolutely freaked out when I heard you guys love Crumbl! 😭❤️ So excited for you to start making videos again!
I'm enjoyng every single video content, it's really nice that you're back, making so much better 2022 with humour and laughs!!! :)
PODCAST PLEASE
Ok so they make frozen chuck e cheese pizza so I grabbed one once a few months ago and the dough was like cardboard we have me of those pizza cutter wheels and each time I went down the lines it wouldn't go through the crust so I used a big knife finally and it came out looking like if I picked it up from them so it's not "recycled" per say but there's something they leave out or put into the dough that makes it cardboardy
We love you Shane!! 💙✨🔥
Damn these comments must be extremely monitored.
hey shane i just wanna let u know that when u fake flirt with chris it could be hurting rylands feelings or making him feel insecure. of course i know nothing about how ur relationship actually is im only speaking from experience as my bf does the same thing with his best friend and it hurts my feelings lol. all love 💗 keep putting out vids!! :)
this brought me so much serotonin, your sense of humor makes me so happy
I would rather eat chucky cheese pizza than little Cesar’s like have you ever been to a little Cesar’s that’s wasn’t in a shady part of town
Yey im so glad youre back shane!!! Welcome back 👏👏
you're right, nobody wanted this
I love that I can tell when this was filmed based off the crumbl cookies 😂
So glad you’re back
I MISS SHANE
You are so incredibly imaginative Shane! Your heart and mind together have so much power. P:S people say I remind them of you all the time, lmao
GO AWAY
BOOO
Can’t wait for the conspiracy theories to come back!👀
I think what Chucky Cheese does is they make a certain amount of pizzas per day and ppl mix and match and also get a different amounts. Say like someone orders 2 pieces, and then someone else orders a whole pizza. They take the pizza that someone ordered a couple pieces from and took 2 slices from a new pizza and that’s why they look different. Does that make sense lol?? It’s kind of hard to explain.
If you make a podcast omg I’d listen omg yesssss pleeaasseeee i miss your content 😭❤️❤️
Loved and needed this today. Welcome back Shane xx
I enjoyed every minute of this video. I was cracking up the whole time! Love seeing you back and happy, Shane 😊❤️
Love ❤️ when Shane uploads 😭
Omg I needed this in my life!!
I love how there’s an urgent care in the background the whole time they’re filming in the Chuck E. Cheese parking lot 😂😂😂
Shane would you be willing to interview ppl that you wouldn't necessarily be friends with or ppl who are respectful but maybe have different views from you?
You had me dying when you said you wanted a mixed crust pizza, omg
I think the pizzas are wonky cause they sell slices. So when some person orders a pizza, they combine the pieces that are left from the pizzas that were ready (but with some slices missing cause they were sold individually). So basically, they don't make a fresh pizza when you order one since they already have all the other ones they made but with some pieces missing. It's not recycling, it's just more efficient then cooking it on the spot. Does that make sense?
Can someone sum this up for me, give me the cliff notes? Don’t feel like watching. Thanks sweaty
You could make a video of literally doing nothing and I will still be excited to watch it.
I constantly laughed sooo hard! Love these kind of videos Shane! ❤️
I missed you so much Shane this video definitely made my day.
This video is so funny omg
give us more!! 😁
I’m still very hurt by you Shane .. but I hope you are doing better mentally
I too hate weddings & am self conscious of being too fat for my wedding dress. I also don’t want a bunch of people I barely like staring and celebrating me. So my husband and I went to the courthouse by ourselves and got married then announced it to our friends and family. It’s been a year since then and I still don’t regret our decision. We made a day of us and our love and it was perfect!
I’m so glad you’re back💜 all is forgiven
I LOVE YOU SHANE!
I really don't care what you upload Shane. I'll watch it all
Shane we missed you so much!! You helped me through so much mental health when you posted all the time. Please come back more. 💛 LOVE YOU!
HECK TO THE YES to the podcast idea!!! 😍😍😍
Shane if you don't marry that man 🤣 sign the damn paper
Omg yay I’m so glad your back, so buzzing to watch :)
Shane has been a big part of my life since I was young, right or wrong I have been here, I love and support you Shane. I just hope you’re able to always love and feel good about yourself. Just remember the tough times are to teach and build you not to break you though it’s still painful but we got you.
Next video he rolls up in the F-150 with a maga hat on.
IDC what people say, you're fucking funny and I enjoy watching you. That's it.
@Shane As your biggest, biggest, biggest fan in the entire flippin galaxy, YES YES AND YES TPE QUEEEEN! Give me that podcast, girl, puuuhleaaaaase!
welcome back shane, we’ve all missed you! no matter what content you upload, i’ll always enjoy watching. seeing the notifi pop up makes my day, i’ve been watching you since 2013 or 2014. i’ve watched you grow, and im unbelievably proud of you. thank you for helping me through theses years, you’re my favourite person in this world. i hope you’re doing well, love you. 💗
$80 on 3 pizzas!?!?!?!
Yikes
I want more of these videos and also the food videos or vlogs😂 you guys are hilarious
to really test to see if the pizza is the same pizza,order one and ask if you can have it uncut and then see if it looks the same.
“Christina Aguilera is here, oh no that’s drama.”  *has mentioned every controversy mf in the past 3 weeks in the past 3 seconds of the video*
PAUSE! Feeling Shane right now on the whole wedding thing. My partner and I (straight, but calling a man of his stature my fiancee just doesnt fit lol), we've been engaged since 2016, it's now 2022 and we have yet to do anything with wedding planning. Beyond the fact that weddings are super expensive and we have to pay for it ourselves, and saving money just isn't an option right now....like we broke to the point we can pay bills, pay minimum on credit cards that are almost max, sometimes get a full tank of gas, and meal plan groceries...beyond all that being the center of attention just sounds miserable. I don't want to go into more debt so I can feed close to 100 people, I have a large family, pay for their entertainment to only just be told we make a cute couple. *rolls eyes* Maybe one day but ehh.... We know we love each other and would like to remain faithful to our partnership so....why the extra? Maybe if I had money to throw at it I'd feel different but for now we'll just keep chugging along.
Can we plz bring back the burgundy shirt conspiracy’s 😩
The outfit !!!! Priceless !!!! 🙏💖💖
All i feel while watching this is pure love, thank you Shane :)
I'm here for Shane bettering himself.. but him flirting with Chris is not it.. and it looks toxic. Even if he is "joking" you can clearly tell it's making Ryland uncomfortable. And that's exactly what a narcissist would do.. is do something just under the radar to hurt you and then claim that they're "joking" and make you look dumb for being sensitive.. Shane, if you're serious, get it together.
I get it.
You can buy Chuck E. Cheese pizza at Fred meyer in the frozen pizza section
Missed missed missed your videos! Podcast.. genius idea 🙌🏼
Whenever i am in Los Angeles, i will DEFINATLY try a chuck E Cheese Pizza!  Famous on Shane"s youtube channel.
When Ryland goes towards the third pizza quote that one was aspired from  a third party I died I died
JUST MARRY RYAN ALREADY - I will gladly attend hehe! Cute video
It pushin p🤣🤣🤣
I need more of your content!! I absolutely love you and I don’t even care that you got cancelled in the past and whatever! I need more content! You are so funny and I can’t get enough of you!! Love you Shane, keep up the good work ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So happy you are back on youtube. ❤🥳
Please bring back the podcast! It would be fun if its about spooky ghost stories or paranormal stuff 👻👀
WE MADE IT SHANE WE GET U
Do the podcast!!!! we want spooky ghost stories 👀👻
its always a good day when i get to see a video of shane also i dont even care if the pizza is suspect i loved it when i was a kid and i will eat just about anything as long as it tastes good XD
I love Shane’s honesty. None of us are perfect. We’re all just trying to figure it all out. It’s so good to see him genuinely happy.
Poor shane having to put up there disclaimer 😅🤣
Ryland eating pizza in the back of the truck is my favorite ryland
So happy your back! Honestly I’m excited for all content, don’t even take it super seriously we’re just excited for videos ❤️
This is my early bday present I am giving to myself watching Shane content all fuckinggg day 🥳🌮❤ #dayoff _vibes on da big screen for ma queen_
Good to have you back Shane!! For real! I was having such a shitty day and was so happy when I saw you uploaded!!! You could literally film yourself doing anything and I would watch it! Lol
The devil works hard but Shane’s lawyer works harder 😂
Please not another podcast lol
the chaotic energy in all of Shane's video is literally soulfood
13 mins in, no idea what the video is about or what's going to happen. But I am rolling on the floor and living for this rn!!
Why'd you feel the need to say the F slur, and even more than once
You should go on Tanas podcast 😂
The woke haters losing their minds bc Shane is trending like a G and not cancelled? I’m 1000% here for it.
Shane I get it and we made it!! 😂🥳🙏🏽
YES PLEASE TO THE PODCAST! This video felt so nostalgic and Shane you look amazing and healthy, keep doing what you’re doing♥️
I was just talking about how much I missed your YouTube videos yesterday and now I just saw that you posted I’m so happy you’re going to start posting more videos I can’t wait for your next conspiracy🥺
Glad to see you post again, this video was pure epicness! kudos to you! 😊
Yessss shane I'm excited for you i love you (sorry if that's weird cuz you don't know who i am lol)
🅿️
I love all your videos.... I was feeling very EHH today but then I saw you posted a video... not gonna lie I got up took a shower, did some chores I was not gonna do today and now I am rewarding myself with your video!!! I needed this today.... thank you Shane !! I love you.
I have Depprisson and i can relate to this video
Pls invite me to the wedding xo
Yay bitch welcome back! like a breath of fresh air I needed this. thanks for the laughs ❤️
Yall really need to help shane focus like get back on track cuz it'll help him with his forgetfulness. His stories and thoughts and opinions are interesting but his train of thought goes off course very easily
OMFG UR FACES WHEN THE PIZZA was STILL fucked up- I cannot lmao
They use a different tool to cut the pizza instead of the rolling one and it messes up the pieces it’s crazy
This whole video Shane is just flirting with the camera guy in front of rylan. I love Shane but damn if you’re not happy then just leave. No one will judge you.
The podcast used to be lit. You were a completely different energy on there. I would listen if you started another. I miss the old podcast gang.
Podcast I'd listen to "Cancelled" with shane Dawson. where you interview people who have been victims of cancel culture and how their lives are affected.
Your not even fat Shane there are people way bigger than you so imagine how they feel listening to you call yourself that.
Please go away 😄
it’s so funny cause I went to goodwill and literally saw his pig backpack there in the bag section
This absolutely made my day! Keep making stuff 😊
Finally!!! ❤️
You look so happy and healthy! 🥰
I love this for you 💕💕 I hope there are more to come x
LOVE THIS
Omg thank you for so many laughs! I can't breathe 🤣❤️
Missed you 💝
Chuck e cheese just has teenagers and other people who don't use a professional pizza cutter they just do it by hand and they suck at it so it looks like 3 different pizzas put together. Also the recipe to make a pizza there is like basically use the smallest amount of everything for the pizza. If u get a really good pizza from chucky cheese it's cuz your cook hooked u up.
YES, MORE OF THIS PLEASE. AND YES PODCAST YES
I miss your old food videos too!!
couldn't stop smiling all throughout :)
I've missed Shane. The amount if alleged  problematic shit he said in the first 10 mins of this video has me overwhelmed. But it's all still funny.
Joke material: What do two gays and a bisexual talk about in a room? Tight Pu**ys xD
In the being of this video it made me think of playing the sims 4 were we control characters and there lives.
I really liked this Shane
You're just such a joy to watch. Love you Shane!🥰
It's very sad that creators have to put disclaimers on the screen now because of some highly-sensitive people who are lacking a sense of humor😐
I saw you posted and I audibly gasped
Its the P for me
Im so happy youre back 💖💖💖 I would check every month to see if you posted again, and I was so happy when you started again. I hope youre happy, healthy, and feeling goid 😊💖💖💖💖
shane i love you so much:( u got me through one of the worst breakup of my life.. a couple years back & for that ill always be thank ful .Pls stay and keep posting videos 🥺
I missss the conspiracy videos
If you do need to put 17 ads in a video in order to upload daily, I'll sit through all of them ❤
THANK YOU SO FUGING MUCH FOR UP LOADING AGAIN KING OOP- YOU DROPPED THIS 👑 ALSO WHO EVER GIVES YOU HATE YOUR BETTER THEN THEM! I NEED YOU SHANE TO KEEP UPLOADING PLEASE KEEP UPLOADING YOUR BETTER THEN THOSE HATERS!
I haven't smiled from ear to ear in sooo long. Thank you Shane. I love you so much and miss you.
I love you Shane ❤️ Never leave again
The republican jokes right at the start c'mon Shane you know they'll cancel you for that.
Shane I get that all the talk about v*ginas was kind of a joke but if you think about it…it is a symbol for birth may it be in the literal sense of children or in a more abstract way a sign for new beginnings and the start of something. Love the video btw
THANKYOU FOR COMING BACK OMFG YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
jamie lynn LMFAO
IM SO HAPPY!!
SHANNNNNE 😩😩😩 i didn’t know this is what i needed today. got the notification that you posted while i was at work nd instantly avoided my responsibilities to watch. AND LET ME. TELL YOU. i laughed my mf ass off the entire time. coworkers walking by prolly think i’m crazy. maybe i am for finding y’all so funny 😭😭 THANK YOUUU and we miss you and hope to see more of you, 2022 needs it.
Wha-
It is so funny to me that Urgent Care is right across the street from Chuck E Cheese lmao its shown in the background when they are in the truck hahaha
43 minutes of happiness 🙏🏼🤩
Yes Shane's back❤️
I dont care what anyone says, I still love you Shane and its so awesome to see you back! You seem so happy.
FINALLY!!!!!!!!! You're back!!! YEEEEEESSSS!!!!
Shane I missed you omg im so glad you are back. I was laughing the whole timeeeeeeeeee! Keep up with the videos we still love ur content. Makes my day <3
i support ya an stuff but this jack black thing gotta go
boring
My bf is a chef who has actually managed several pizza places, and that's not from a pizza cutter. It's just not.
You need to infiltrate and get a job and see if when they cook the pizzas they come out like that lol
Loved it
Shane, i get it
Been LOVING the ryland vlogs. Glad to see you grinding on these long format projects, again 😈
Lmfao not the pizza againg 🤣 but it's so obv that they maked it out of trash🤣
I'm so confused lmao does every Chuck E Cheese know not to let him in? He goes to one in Colorado and they are like nope sorry no Shane Dawson's allowed. haha
Love this❤
Señor pooh 💀
TPE - 😆
Love Shane's humour had me laughing from start to finish... Who new ryland had such a jealous side? Just so you know its obvious that Shane adores you! He will marry one day! Love the video was awesome!
C ya!  Come on back y’all.
i’m sad that i finished this :(((
Missed you so much!!!!!!!!!
Why is every YouTuber I watch have a cameraman called chris
fuck cats !!!!!
So 💡 idea, what if you order a pizza from Chuck E. Cheese uncut? Thoughts?
Oh, no
I can confirm that a Chucky Cheese employee cut themselves and bled all over the pizzas and they served them.
The only way it makes sense to me that it’s not a “recycled” pizza is if they are a buffet and instead of making a pizza fresh they just grab however many pieces it takes to make a large pizza from the buffet…but isn’t that still sort of recycling…just not from tables but from a buffet lol
Welcome back Shane!!! loved the video as always!!!!
Does 3 large pizzas really cost 80 dollars in the U.S???
I'm so happy you're back! You've always been my favourite you tuber and always will
im actualyl surprised ppl are still supporting this dude lmao
Oh
This was by far the best, and funniest video I've watched in AWHILE. The p***y talk just had me DYING
This made my day! I laughed way too hard. Welcome back! You're amazing 💚
If there ever comes a “Tight Pussy Energy” shirt I’m going to need one.
‘Before you know you don’t know’ iconic Ryland Adams 🤓🙌🙃
Shane just brightens up my day!!
Not the Urgent Care in the background, while eating the recycled pizza 😂😂
such a skinny legend
Welcome back, Shane.  You went through some rough times (emotionally).  Hopefully you are in a better place.  You seem like a perfectionist.  Just get married already!  It will never be perfect, but you guys are perfect together.  Sending you love!
Glad your back you look so well I think getting out of LA was so good for your mental health hope you continue to upload.
I loved every minute. Haven’t laughed so hard in a while. Thanks Shane ! Looking forward to more content !
Not the chemical imbalance causing a lazy eye 😂😂😂 I am personally attacked 😂😂😂
🥰🥰🥰
Missed you so much Shane I’ve been laughing and smiling the whole video
Ahhhhh yes 🙌
Omg SHANE I’ve missed you ! I’ve been waiting for you to post a video for the longest time ! WELCOME BACK B**** 🥰🥰🥰🎉🍾
Enjoyed all of it. Nice to see you back on your channel
I think Chuck E mix and match pizza pies but from selling single slices and half pies lol i hope 😂 still i wouldn't even question it tbh 🤷🏻‍♀️
25:40 🤣🤣🤣🤣
i like the new shane
I used to listen to Shane’s podcast multiple times a day when he was doing them. And if he brings Jesse back on as a co host I will literally cry
All the cool nicknames Shane is making for Chris (Ryan’s Camera guy) are so creative and adorable
Don’t like your hat … sorry
Shane kinda flirted with Chris this whole video, and Ryland pointed it out every time
32:00 Shane you gotta go on a Saturday or something when they're busy.  There's nobody there, of course they're gonna make a full pizza.
Let's be honest we're not here for specific content we're here for Shane
So great to see you back again, we missed you!!
Pandemic got even worse not that your back
Wow has Shane actually posted after years of nothing? What an amazing happy day to see this! We don’t care what you post just post something for us fans! Love you so much Shane! I have never seen that many likes for one video! 90k already. So many people are and have been waiting for you Shane to come back to us! Lol 😂
i honestly need a series of Ryan and Shane just talking about anything UNHhhh style 😂
We need a new camera man this one is really annoying
Omg 🖤  I love how happy you look and joking around again. This video literally turned my whole mood around. I was having a crappy day at work. But this turned my day around. I smiled and laughed the whole time. It also makes me so happy to see you enjoying life, smiling ,laughing and making jokes. I can't wait for more videos 💋
Haha lmao I love it when shitty people leave for a year and come back like nothing happened because they know that they’ll still be able to make money despite their terrible actions
Ok this camera guy needs to go him laughing behind the camera is so extremely annoying
OMG I WAS LITERALLY WATCHING YOUR CHUCKY E CHEESE CONSPIRACY VIDEO THE OTHER DAY 😂😭🖤🖤 GLAD YOURE BACK, SHANE!! 👀🖤🖤🖤
Here’s a good debunking point. 😂 When they cut the pizza they have to cut it fast because they are probably always pumping out pizzas so when they cut it fast it shifts slices around as well as trying to cut all the way through the crust sometimes you have to go over it several times which can result in a small chuck being cut out.
❤❤❤❤❤
Poor Rylan can't live in peace and enjoy some chuckee pizza
Thank you for everything shane 💖
WE LOVE YOU SHANE 💙👍
Thank you for still posting things your interested in and continue to teach people like myself and others. Keep bringing your joy through your videos & I hope you continue to enjoy the journey.
God, I missed seeing his face on my screen 💙
Please don’t let him on your podcast.  Btw Nooo!  STOP THINKING!  You’re  trying to find excuses so you can Back out of the Podcast idea.  .
I'm so glad you're back. This was fun can't wait to see what's next.💚
can i come to the wedding
I have missed you on YouTube so much
To me it looks like the Pizza is cut before they put it in the oven that's what makes it looking so weird
had me cackling on a day i couldn’t get out of bed thank you! :)
Shane should make his own pizza to see how its made thooo 👀
I omg I was going to send you a picture on Instagram of a Chuck E. Cheese pizza from when I went Friday 2/11/22. The pizza is still suspicious!
I love this 💀🤣♥️
I missed your videos Shane, please upload more
Have you seen the Food theory video on the whole pizza thing? They disproved it for many reasons
I wonder if you order the pizza and tell them Not to cut it, if they would and then see how it looks when it's not cut 🤔
The light in this house is amazing.
If your watching this video..you get it...WE MADE IT. 😂😂
Shane is a predator just in case you forgot
This is exactly what I want!!! Listen I love your conspiracy’s, and more produced videos… but I really just love these Vlog style videos! I think that’s why the beauty community on YouTube has changed because we like vlogs/day in the life’s. They are more casual and easy to watch!
It's crazy how, two days ago, I was thinking how much I miss your videos. And bum, you post one, wow 😄
#wemadeit
Your tribe is still here, Shane. In fact, we never left.
Awh happy to see u Shane :)
I screamed at 1:41 when he said “take off that mask “☠️☠️
so good too see such a familiar face again! you look like you’re doing better and i can see it! YOU’RE DELICIOUSLY UNIQUE 🍕🥰
so happy rn, i never stopped laughing
20:30 although jealous Ryan is hilarious 😂 from one bi to another, no one "misses" the other gender lol it is more complicated than that, so he shouldn't be worried about it, work on that self love Ryan ❤ Shane loves you very much 🥰
I’d 110% listen to your pod cast!
Shane be pushing to much 🅿️ this man need a forklift
nope, still hate him
Why does it take him a half hour to get into the part that is actuallllllly about the title…
First 5 min in I can not stop laughing. This is exactly what I needed right now, I’ve missed you 🥲🥲🥲
The most in deph google review, Ever!
You are my hero, my best friend and everything that I could ask for. Shane you have helped me through the darkness, drawn me to the light and showed me that not everything is about being sad. I feel that life without you being a creator to teach people that would not be as fulfilling without you in it
RYLAND WITH THE SANTAS HELPER OUTFIT? I AM SCREAMING i cant breathe
I made dough  every morning at little Caesars  from scratch and it made a perfect circle soo idk about that answer lmaooo 😂
We ALL thought Free Britney was a Conspiracy!, and it was the TRUTH.
So happy to see this video! I could care less what the video is about, I low key love a random vlog from you anytime! ❤️
“Oh Oh Oh Ryland!” 😂😂😂😂😂
The thing is I’d not only buy a TPE sweatshirt I would wear it and not burn it on tiktok for views .
Suggestion: instead of a wedding cake… cater in Crumbl’s cookies. 🥰🥰🥰
OMG, I laughed so hard! Thank you!
Is he deleting comments or something? There’s no way everyone is excited to see him back after everything that happened
Shane I love you 😭💕 your old videos kept me going for that couple years thank you for being light and joy to my life
Not y’all forgetting everything this man has done 💀💀
don't go off the crust, go from the sauce, if you look they line up lol
Bilateral
HES BACK BABY
Pretty sure it seems like Shane isn't into Ryland anymore
Ryland is soooo cringe 😬
Yay your back!
IVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR EVER OMGGGGGGGG WHO EVER IS PLAYING MY GAME LETS GET A LITTLE MORE CREATIVE I WANNA HAVE SOME MORE FUNNN UGH
Anyone 23 and younger I feel so bad for, their souls minds have been so tested the past 3 years being  so young i know it's even harder..i pray they are happy, knowing life will get better and things will change . Hang in there young adults your time will come for true happiness🙏❤️😇
I’m excited to see your new conspiracy videos!! I can’t wait (:
It’s crazy how this opened.  I was joking with a friend about that
This had me cracking up the whole time 😂😂
“It made me a republican” is funny because it’s actually true that so many people fleeing democratic run states/cities are leaving for that reason
Made my day  hahahaha xx
10:48 if you do a podcast pleaseee have a video upload about it too 😔 I just can't keep focused with podcasts lol but a 1hr video? no problem 😂
i missed u sm
Omg I missed these types of videos so much! I’m glad you are back Shane everyone deserves a chance for redemption!
I say this with genuine concern and love.. your “spirit guide” is actually a demon and “real” psychics also use demons to communicate with the spirit realm. Good news is they flee at the name of Jesus, so please seek His deliverance from any evil covenants you’ve knowingly/unknowingly entered into. I was deceived as well. Just look up testimonies here on YouTube regarding new age to Jesus.
Girl wtf is this 💀💀💀
Food videosssssss! Do it
I miss the happy but dark humor Shane so much glad to see him getting back to himself.
Why has this guy from at least 10 years in the past popped back up?
In my opinion Ryland is annoying I really don't like him I try to like him but I just can't maybe his a different person when his not on camera but I hate his persona or the character his playing all he talks about is money and buying stuff his a material girl. 🤔
Subscribed to you and find out you posted through spill sesh. Stupid YT notifications don't work. But I'm here xox
lol it’s like everyone forgot he likes little kids
10:03 the noises that I made from that bit OMG 😂 I'M DYING
Let’s just say, ryland was pushing 🅿️ in that dream you had
I’m so happy you are back pls stay for ever and pls make the podcast happen that will be amazing you are so talented you will do amazing …
Not really feeling the whole Ryland is an F word, “I’m gay so I can say it” vibe….
Y can't u just ask them for a pizza without cutting it into slices... 🤔
Love the video but sell the dang LA house. Sell, sell! Colorado is it.
Ah man thus video was so much fun, so nice to see u on YouTube again shane!
I want anything from you. Literally EVERYTHING you do is absolutely amazing!
The sad music playing in the background is giving me life
Why is this in my recommended  What the fuck is this
This feels so nostalgic like the old Shane videos! I love it 🥰 glad you’re back
the way i was HOWLING at shanes face when they opened the pizza box hahaha
When he said "God put some things together. Didn't quite make a regular  person." It reminded me of something my doctor, who I love, said. "It's like when God was making you, he only had a regular size mannequin for the waist up and plus size pieces for the waist down and arms." (I'm a pear body type) And I've never related to Shane more. Hahaha.
Love from Italy!i love your video !!!
I'm glad Shane still has his sense of humor !
More conspiracy videos let’s fucking gooo
I absolutely LOVE your conspiracy videos! Would love more from you!!!
This is EXACTLY what I want and need in my life. I laughed the entire time!
Shane you have not lost your sense of humor at all- this was hilarious and everything the world needs.
Shane Pushin 🅿️
Shane is baaaack!!!👑 🥳🙌🏽 looking forward to the podcast!!
laughing so hard at the beginning rant, i just realized Shane has shaped my sense of humor from watching him all this years lol 😂 i missed your videos so much!
the genuine laughs and happiness i get from watching you is literally the highlight of my week ✨pure dopamine✨
Shane, I have missed you much! I am so glad you are trying to do thing's that make you happy, please never stop trying to make yourself happy! Love you tons!!!
No podcast... but, only it you do haunted houses while doing a live broadcast or  tell horror story's or conspiracies on the podcast.   I definitely see you doing that. Sorry I don't want to shoot your ideas...... just an opinion from a long time viewer.
Marry Ryland! Your backyard in CO is a perfect venue for a small intimate beautiful gathering! I remember one of the first videos showing it someone (the realtor maybe?) mentioned it had been used as a venue by some locals because of how whimsical and beautiful the backyard was. Between Ryland & Morgan’s decorating & design skills, your out of the box creativity and ability to execute & produce projects you guys could have the most magical wedding. Doesn’t need to be traditional, just needs to be what makes you guys happy. Including wearing what you want. You don’t have to wear a suit. You can have crumbl cookies. You can have whoever you want officiate it. You will end up loving whatever it is you guys do as a wedding because it’ll be your guys day. It’ll be exactly what you want, not what you think a wedding has to be. You’ll cherish those memories. Yeah weddings can be stressful, I went in with a I don’t give an eff mentality and stuck to my guns for what my husband and I wanted. We didn’t want a lot of the traditional things despite getting crap from people. We didn’t care. We loved every minute of that wedding it was amazing and I miss that day lol. It’s such a special day with your SO that is for you guys to promise commitments to one another and celebrate one of life’s most amazing experiences. Some things in life deserve a celebration, and we deserve as humans to celebrate and be celebrated.
I mean, can we just appreciate Rylands phone composure there 🅿️
More Shane! I’m so excited for the podcast ❤️❤️❤️❤️
this was acc very funny
I throughly laughed through this whole video and it enjoyed it so much!
Oh I missed you so much 🥺🥺🥺
OMG I love this already can’t wait for more 😂😂😂
You know what!!! I'm gonna rewatch all of his conspiracy videos
Hey Shane I've been a fan for years now. I grew up on you and miss your vlogs with Ryland and going on spooky adventures. This really brings back nostalgia. Please make more videos 😁 no one can force you off the internet
Until they come up with a realistic and provable explanation for why their pizza looks like that, then they shouldn’t sue you and I will continue to believe the conspiracy
Open https://youtu.be/DSGWYAO-yOw
Dude if I hit the powerball next week I will so buy your house lmao
I am so happy Shane is back with new videos, absolute loved this.
So happy you are back! You were missed!
Man how i enjoyed this video. Please do a weekely upload. Miss you. Just you being you makes my day a whole lot better. 🤗💕💕
When I worked there I really  struggled with  stretching the dough on the pan  and my pizzas always came out wonky 😅 and that cutter was heavy and would make my pizza move. But it was always made fresh. My boss was very very strick on cleanliness at our store.  And I think she'd die or possibly  murder (lol) if anyone would of even tried to recycle  the pizza. 🤣 . I love you Shane thank you so much for your videos  they make my day.
Miss you boo ❤️
OMG I LOVE YOU SO MUCH SHANE!!!😭❤ This whole video had me laughing🤣💀. I honestly don't care what kind of videos you make as long as your in them, I'm watching PERIOD.🤷🏽‍♀️ Your vibe is everything !🥰
Love you shaneeeee 🥰
The person in your head Shane saying " don't go in there" is called the holy ghost. God gave us all one to help us, closer we are to him and being a good person were hear it louder. 🙏❤️😇
I’m genuinely so glad you are back. Colorado seems to be so good for you. And it’s incredibly unfair that your past mistakes made you feel unworthy of your incredible talent for a while. Everyone has done fucked up shit, but we just aren’t in the public eye. I’ve been watching you since you started and I love seeing you thrive. ♥️ welcome back Shane.
Ryland scarfing down the pizza has me dead
*Resting your throat and getting it ready*   Was NOT prepared for that one 😂🤣
Shane’s face when he opened that box HAHAHHA
20:05 thank god , Chuck E. Cheese is protecting the children!!!
Yawn… I’m honestly tired of his woe as me, cutaway, whiny videos.  This will be the last time I’ll try to watch his videos.
When you did the first chuck e Cheese video, I remember seeing quite a few employees and ex employees say that the reason it looks like that is bc they do, in fact, consolidate the pizzas.. however, they don't make them out of pizza left at tables, they do it with pizzas that have only ever been behind the counter with employees. (Meaning that say someone orders like 6 slices, and then the next person orders 4, they need to take them from separate pizzas, leaving each with leftover pieces, then they would put THOSE together and I guess reheat it..?) Idk but the bottom line was that customers never touch the pizzas they consolidate. And tbh I believe it. Bc it makes sense and I just can't see a business of that size taking that kind of risk. And all of the hundreds of employees.. surely SOMEONE would've exposed them by now if it were true.   But yeah anyways I'm pretty sure that's what's going on. Although, the fact that they don't just admit and kept trying to make other excuses that didn't make sense is kind of shady ngl.
I’m so excited for your new Conspiracy video and the future videos!!! Much Love Shane ❤️
Not only do the slices not line up, but also the pepperonis aren’t matching up either!!!🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♀️
The Diet Shane lip balm is my favorite lip balm ever and I wish I could buy more because I’m almost out 😭😭
🅿️‘s in the chat
LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU. SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK
“Is that chuckie? That’s him!” LMFAO Shane youre hysterical 🤣🤣
I loved all about this video!
He’s backkkk😏🔥🔥This is great
Yay so cool!
Oh honey this is what I want 😁
I forgot how funny Shane is in video so happy he uploading I can’t wait to watch more
@shane I've been having a really hard time with the winter due to my cerebral palsy, and my depression and ptsd has been kicking my ass. I planned on taking my whole script of 2mg Xanax and this came up on my feed at just the right time. Thank you so much, I hope this helps get me through as you always have ♡
If the joke doesn't land just try another punchline and another and another...never give up lmao
The It eyes 💀
I fucking love this so much! Thank you Shane
So happy to see you back. Laughed so much during this video. Loved it. ❤ Can't wait to see whatever it is you choose to post, it will be worth it.
Everyone watching this: *completely appalled by the pizza and talking crap the whole time* Also everyone: "damn I kinda want a piece though.."
We should just return it😂😂
Bring back Farrah time
They could be taking half of a prepped pepperoni pizza and half of a prepped cheese pizza and cooking them together. I worked fast casual and did that before. It’s much faster than putting pepperonis on a prepped cheese pizza. Also transferring pizza moves it and cheese melts in grooves making it look wonky.
✨ soo quirky ✨
Using the crumbl cookie flavors of the week to know when the videos are taking place
I am so happy for you that you are back!! I would love to see more conspiracy videos ! :D hope this year back on YouTube brings you happiness and gives you opportunities ! ❤️
🐈
I really don't think Shane is Bi.. He only uses it to make ryland jealous
I got married in a normal green dress and leggings in our home, and our wedding cake was a Shrek cake. You can have any wedding you want 😊
More of these fun videos. I love watching you and ryland do random fun blogs.
sidenote, but chuck e cheese pizza is litterely like the top 3 best tasting pizza in all of America 😂
I love you Shane! Stop letting these shitty people get you down. You’re a BEAUTIFUL human ❤️❤️❤️
you should partner with them and film a video of them making the pizza
Shane pushing 🅿️ 😂
Christopher Columbus
These videos are my favourite.
People forget so fast. He didn’t take a break to focus on himself, he was hiding away from the world until the short attention span of the internet inevitably forgot about the horrible things he’s done
I love that a gay man is owning the word faggot so confidently and hilariously
$80 on 3 pizzas!?
love u shane
Missed you Queen excited for the new vids
I love this so much I missed your videos!
This is EXACTLY what we want. Love you Shane and your sense of humor. And, yes, please start a podcast!!
WE WANT TIGHT PUSSY ENERGY MERCH PLZ AND THANK YOU <3
Shane i miss you.. you Make My Day 🥰
God I’ve missed you so much. You have the best sense of humor on YouTube
suddenly, everyone forgave him for all the things he did. y’all are weird
I love how happy and light-hearted this video is. I've missed seeing Shane doing what he loves  so much, and I couldn't be more happy that he's back <3
I’m so fucking happy and proud that you’re back here 🙌
I love you Shane
I've been wearing my OMG pig shirt for 5 years. Proudly. I love anything Shane .
Shane you have not lost your sense of humor at all- this was hilarious and everything the world needs.
Love this thanks Shane ❤️❤️❤️
NEED MORE THEORY VIDEOS 😭
The Big Return to LA: *immediately goes to Chuck e Cheese first thing*
all you guys just forgot about what he has done, i would like to see how many dislikes this video has, if anyone can find out, pleae post on reddit.
i love how quickly shane's moods change bc that is literally what the inside of my head sounds like 🤣
the podcast sounds great. I would love to listen to your theories, opinions and just your funny conversations
Even being back in LA.. it feels like the hiatus to Colorado still did it's job. Shane still seems happier.  I mean HE suggested wearing those ridiculous outfits out in public lol I just couldn't see him doing that like 8+ months ago. It's the little things..
So. It could be the result of a dull cutting blade on an indented cutting board. If you mess up the lines you end up with cheese and bread sliding everywhere.   I've never worked at chuckecheese but if they had a dumb quality rule or  if they had to cut a specific number of "perfect" slices (aka without bubbles, uncovered crust, or were pulling slices from frozen packages and baking them) it might result in an uneven circular shape.   But that's not how you should run P Pizza company.  This is all speculation and I love our rat and pig overlord.
dude i getting shane energy so much in this video like what the fuck its so great to really really have you back ❤️ love you
shane looks so much more happier and healthier ! im glad that he took a long break to focus on himself ❤
YESSS PLEASE!!! More funny food videos!!!! There are so many things you could try from tiktok!
All this sex talk about women and Chris made ryland very uncomfortable, I LOVE Shane but he is not the best at reading people emotions of those in the room with him
I want to see a pizza (that turns out like this!) from start to finish if they say it’s all one pizza. SHOW ME THE PROOF 😂😂
Tbh I think you could post damn near anything and get views bc it’s you 🤷🏼‍♀️
I really missed him, so glad to have him back!!!!
🖤🖤🖤🖤
🤡😭🖤
Omg can you please do a video on where all the Rice Krispies have gone?! #conspiracy
I love how Shane has only gotten funnier! His sense of humour is different more matured, more intelligent just hilarious. And the whole thing about throat closing up because of communication issues is very true. I’m glad you’re speaking now
This was fantastic 😂
Zor
ihy
THIS IS WHAT WE WANT 😭 this editing is so good and funny. We can see how much you put into EVERY video. ❤️
Shane Dawson Saying the N Word https://youtu.be/m4ljGORmrVE
“can pizza get covid?”
Shane is like the Jim carry of YouTube lol
so cringe
So happy to see you!
I missed genuinely laughing and getting lost in a video
It's time for an Adam and Eve drop LOL shawn needs to go and get himself a pocket p
I do miss these like more simple videos of yall just messin around!
you’re literally so hilarious Shane always got me laughing and making my days so much better I LOVE YOUUUU
Thank you for not giving up on us!
THIS 👏🏼 IS 👏🏼 THE 👏🏼 SHANE 👏🏼 WE 👏🏼 ALL 👏🏼 KNOW 👏🏼 AND 👏🏼 LOVE 👏🏼
I had my sweet 16 at Chuck-E-Cheese. I’m 37 now so I don’t remember the food.😩
Shane we need new conspiracy theory videos right about nowwwww
I would like a Lot LoT for you to do conspiracy. 💋
I missed your face
🤍🤍🤍
My favorite person!! 😀😀😀 so happy to see a video from you
I think what happens is they only make the cheese and pepperoni pizzas separate so when someone orders half and half, they just add the pieces from the whole pies. If that makes sense. That’s my 2 cents.
I missed seeing you so much!! I got my dose with Ryland's videos. This was super funny as always, I just love your sense of humor ❤️
Ryland was sooo annoyed with Shane and Chris when he was talking to Chuck e Cheese lmao
Chucke we’re friends LMAO
I forgot to unsubscribe 😂 BYE animal abuser
It's funny how they don't even know that a tight vagina, means a girl isn't into it. And if it is "loose" she's ready for it and enjoys it
24:40 Chris's reflection gave me the biggest heart attack lmao I thought he was a statue and then he started moving 😂
I missed you Shane!!!!!
This is video is hilarious
Excited about your podcast!! ♥️ ♥️♥️
Hilarious!!! Missed Shane’s humour!
I already offered on Rylands vlogs to be your surrogate and we could have a weird open adoption and I'll take up residency in the house.
THANK GOD YOU’RE BACK. It’s been so boring and dangerous without you.
My thought is Chuck E. Cheese maybe sells single slices and then if they don’t sell all of the single slices from one they use them when someone orders a whole pizza maybe..🤨
Voices in your head is def mental illness. This vid is for fun but modern medicine is the answer
You're on fire Shane! 😆😄👏👏👏👏 I can't keep up with all the jokes lol You're too funny I swear
So glad you are back Shane! Your videos always brighten My Day missed you so much ❤️
34:03, literally sounds like cassie telling rue in euphoria ''You don't have to, just take it one day at a time''.
I would like to see conspiracy videos!!! I miss them tons
Never been so happy to have you back! Any video is a good video ❤️❤️
The outfits 😂😂😂love it
Idk man, his videos now are  just so incredibly forced and try-hard. I find him unbearable these days unfortunately. I gave the past few videos a chance, it’s just lame. Even the snippet of the documentary at the beginning, he’s still doing all of the same over dramatic tropes and using all of the dumb stock footage. The format worked in it’s time, it doesn’t work anymore. And his “funny content” like this video just isn’t organic. I just can’t look at him the same anymore, it’s not genuine
I'm so happy that Shane is back!! 🥳🎉
Holy shit I'm glad I have youtube premium
Shane I’ve missed you so much on your channel! Been getting my fix from rylands videos HAHA
This caused me so much anxiety. The cameraman makes too much sound sucking in breaths, the clothes rubbing noises are too loud and you are so all over the place when talking...I couldn't even finish the video it made me motion sick.  Honestly your cameraman sucks
almost want to cancel shane for perpetuating "tight" vaginas. wtf is this shane?!
I have not smiled this much watching a vlog in a long while! Now, I can get fab entertainment with Rylands videos, plus exciting girl talk with the SIP and now (!!!!) Shane, you are back and you are 🔥. Yes!!!! Please do a podcast! ♥️
Dude, I am just so glad you are back. I will watch literally ANYTHING you put out. Some of us are here cause we just love YOU regardless of the content.
❤️🤣❤️🤣
Why dont you just ask them to not cut the pizza?
YESSSSS this is what I’ve been waiting for the conspiracy’s are back babyyyyy !!!!
“A mix!” Lol 💀💀💀
I love this <3 Welcome back! :D
It was awesome CUZ it was just u being silly u!!! Anyone wld want that!!!!
Chucky Cheese definitely uses old pizza for new pizza.
is he deleting comments? omfg shane- this is petty. you made mistakes. take responsibility AND the backlash. jesus.
Ok but you were right to be anxious about Covid, it killed 900,000 Americans. I remember in the beginning (when I was already doomscrolling virology twitter 😅) and  you were the only person I saw acting rationally about it
This was so fun!love u Shane!
So happy he's back 😊
Wow
The way I fucking gaspwd
This is everything love you content
My voice is violent ;-; smh I want a new player
This. This is my happiness
Hi shane! I've missed you! I dont care what you post, I'll watch it. Same with ryland and morgan. Your energy is so much happier ❤
You have no idea how much your videos help me. Thank you for uploading ❤️
Pointless info 1. Chucky is a rat, because he's inspired by Mickey Mouse 2. They cut the pizza like a million miles an hour, that's why it's fucked up My microwave pizza pieces never fit together after I cut them  Enjoyed the video as usual tho <3
31:39 what’s that background music called ooo
yaaaas!! I LOVE that you re-visited the Chucky Cheese conspiracy! So funny seeing how you reacted exactly how I would! Hopeful and then completely not expecting what happens! ahahaha MORE!!!
This is great Shane!!!! Thank you for all the laughs as always 💜💜💜💜💜
I worked for Domino’s a couple years ago and I’ve cut many pizzas lol. The only thing we used was a large pizza cutter, nothing special. It’s not that hard to cut a pizza 🥴 unless you just don’t have arms or blindfold yourself while cutting
What we’re not going to do is give him Clout again
I will watch whatever you post
Yessss I'd love to see the food vids back 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Omg yasss conspiracy videos from u are life can’t wait love u so much and ready for podcast ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️☺️
I loved the video. Very enjoyable to see you just being yourself and be goofy. ❤️ The whole pizza thing, though ... Come on. You can clearly see the pieces shifted when they were cut, and they don't fit together as nearly anymore, cause the pepperoni and the cheese for pushed down and to the side when cut. I know you are smart enough to know this.
no bc the pizza looks soooo good
I’m so happy for this channel
Shane looks so happy
I know he has a very specific sense of humor, but I actually felt bad for Ryland during this video. He has always been so supportive of Shane, and to have to sit through him joking about having sex with Chris and wishing Ryland had a vagina was just awkward and sad. I love them both, but that just felt weird to me.
This is exactly what I wanted
"Here's something... you dont want" XD for the haters and the lovers lol
Just watched your video and let me just say I missed them so much! You guys had me laughing it was really good!!! 💙💙💙💙💙
Shane is back! ❤  All i need is Jenna marbles to come back and my life will be complete again
The intro gives off Paranormal Activity vibes lol
Shane your videos are my happy place 🤍
wait when did chrissy teigen get cancelled? why???
Glad you’re back, you are just so funny.
Awesome to see you!!
Pushin 🅿️ .. it’s a song by gunna
I adore Shane's sense of humour he is so quick witted I could watch him all day.
Love you Shane♥️🤗            Yes I’m a real Witch! Hit me up for that podcast🔮✨
It's good to see you back would love to see more conspiracy theory videos
I’m here for all of it!!!
Please I need an update on the demon in your house before u sell the house
i honestly could not stop laughing ! i absolutely loved this video and im happy your back. Dont think this is bad or people are not gona like it. youre an amazing film maker and honestly you just need your own network show js.
So happy for Shane, Ryland and his camera person(Chris I think) Best journey to you all Blessed Be
Glad to have you back! Your spooky videos are my fav, but your singing with headphones videos kill me every time!
I havent lought this hard in forever 😂
Yesssssssss i am ready, I need a new podcast in my life! And more conspiracy vids. Welcome back ✌️
But did you really fix it? I think an apology that isn't so vague and you just beat around the bush. Yes you learn from the past but. Hmmm did you really? I honestly love how funny you are as do other people but I think you should really apologize
I loved this!  This was such a fun and funny video!  More please!!
Hf I love you 😂😂 funny video
"If you're watching this video you get it" yyyeeaaahh.... 😬
Shane & friends podcast was my very first podcast. So I am so 100$ excited for you to start your new one.
I'll never support someone with history like yours u should never be near a kid.
I wish Chris would stop snorting randomly.  Grosses me out
I’ve missed you sooo much
I would religiously watch the pod
I will literally watch anything you post and love it you’re energy is just so contagious and makes my day better every time I watch you’re videos❤️
Had me cracking up! thanks for the laughs
Ayyye I was wondering where you went. I was like what happened to the gay homie that did the conspiracy videos and  bam notification. I stopped watching 2 years ago and got no notifications since 😂
Omg raylan dress in the xmas dress jojo shoes and conspiracy jacket lol omg why did it look cute and weird lol  Omg  You guys should have ate inside then pack the pizza back up it’s different when you eat in or have it delivered or take out
I’m excited!
I will never not love shane, God I missed him
12 minutes in and ive seen nothing but bullshit?? Content keeps getting worse and worse. Take accountability for your wrong actions and get tf off this platform.
Loved!!!! I laughed so hard.
I actually like these kind of videos more☺️
Ok Ryland is clearly jealous of the camera guy and I really can’t blame him😭😭
Omg Shane 😂 those legs don’t match that torso 😂 where does he come up with this stuff
Drama channels are shook because Shane is back and pull 1 million views in less than 24 hours and is trending 👏 👌  can't wait to see how they will start bringing up old things again.. welcome back Shane were here for it♥♥
SHANE I MISSED YOU
P = pushin p
Maybe they cut it before its cooked all the way.
I did not work at Chuck E. Cheese but I have worked at Casey’s before. We have made our pizzas as well and used the big pizza cutter that was like a huge blade that used both hands and went all across the pizza. If you weren’t the best at cutting it yes sometimes slices would be bigger than others but the crust always lined up around the edges and that’s with making our own crust
My mom's passing will be 2 weeks ago tomorrow. We LOVED to watch you together and I got us each a Conspiracy palette. Watching you today is so bittersweet. Thank you for being you.
A podcast with others that have been “cancelled”
I'm living for this
Personally I would be too insecure to take Shane’s jokes about being with other people I’m too much of a mess to think it’s not a joke 😂🙈🙈
I’m so happy to see Shane.
PLEASE PLEASE make Tight Pussy Energy Merch! I am begging you from my TP!! <3 <3
i wont say anything about their pizza cause i don’t want shane getting in trouble but like… man that pizza not right 😭
Why is there multiple accounts leaving the exact same comment, word for word.. Supporting you? Such a flood of positivity in this comment section.. I cannot find one negative comment which is extremely weird.. Especially for someone like yourself, Shane. Shady business.
All those ideas at the end, i am waiting for them! KEEP UPLOADING 😭😭😭😭😭
So, when you cut a pizza, aren't all the pieces usually the same size? Either they make random cuts for whatever reason and each piece has a different size or.......chuckle chuckle SNORT!!
WE MISSSSSSED YOU SOOOO MUCHHHH!!! ❤️❤️🥺
The entire conversation of the 45 minutes was hilarious
Ummm Shane , i don’t appreciate you flirting with the cameraman in front of our Queen Ryland 🍅🍅👎🏽
Are we really getting daily uploads??? 😄🤣
LMFAO omg Shane I love your videos and your humor 😂 definitely missed you !! I think we have very similar humor so I feel like I relate to you so much 😂 the Chuck E. Cheese review was so funny 😂
Please do not come back
Crumble cookie at your wedding, whenever it is 😂🙌🏻 glad your back!!🤍🤍🤍
NOOO this is SOOOO MUCH BETTER!!! Conspiracy videos are overdone now. like you said new year new you. This is what ppl want now, more of YOU being REAL not fake story's. Loved this! best video you've done since you've been back ❤ can't wait for more.
Ok but yes new merch? Please? Yeah
I love you!!
We want ANY Shane video!
9min in *brb gota switch my bag and put on my hoodie* ootd brought to the Midwest by Shane* I’m overjoyed to see you being creative! Repub comment hits home babe. 💙 ps-I’m a wedding coordinator hmu.. 😘
I was dead laughing the first 3 minutes 🤣🤣🤣 Shane so glad you're back!!
Dude the simulation thing is so true. Look up Neville Goddard. We are all rooted in creation. We are all connected to the higher power. ❤
About time (; we miss you. Need that podcast asap.
I love these videos. I love you Shane!!!
I think they slice the pizzas before putting them in the oven... that's the only thing that makes sense
I've missed you being silly, it's really cheered me up , and I've had a really sh***y day. Thank you ❤️💜
So glad ur back literally my childhood, teen years and now adult. Shit no wonder I'm fucked up.. KIDDINGGG
Yes Shane please do a podcast!!! ❤️ I miss your conspiracy theory videos so much.
Chucky cheese is better than dominoes ! Its p lol
I haven't laughed this hard in a while.
A true test for Chuckie: order 1 large pizza with olives and see if it is still different shapes and sizes. They definitely don’t have an abundance of pizza slices with olives laying around. If the pizza is still odd shapes there is a better chance that’s how it always comes. If it’s perfectly circular… you have your proof.
The beginning just killed me omg.. the first 3 minutes lmfao
This is exactly what I needed 😅😂😂😂🖤
You make my day😂
WE NEED CONSPIRACY THEORIES
I missed you so fucking much, you look so happy and so much better <3 so proud of you
You guys are so funny! Watching this made my day. Thanks! ❤️❤️❤️
Can we get a series of you going back and revisiting things that were huge for you on YouTube? Graveyard girl, Chuck E. Cheese, conspiracy palette with Jeffree etc.  and reflecting on it and almost making it a huge laughing with you moment.
So happy to Shane happy! Excited for more videos to come
Shane’s like I believed in you 😂😂 (nooo)
Your videos helped me smile in my dark days of falling into deep depression and alcohol abuse, please post more like you did a few years ago so I can enjoy them while in recovery 😊🤍
Shane's back. Shane's back. *little happy dance* 😊 😃
Let's get you in that suit!
I am so so happy to see your back at it. I missed your videos🥺
The nickname is soo right there! Chris crumble like Chris Cringle ✌
I would watch anything you put out I really can't wait to see more from you I miss it!
He should do the mind of Kanye west
18:55 yeah.. I get it lol
It looks like they cut the pizza and THEN put the toppings on before baking? Like...maybe that's  why they're weirdly separated and some have a "shrunken" appearance?..
I've missed this sm 🤧 💓
Glad you're back, BTW you made me want pizza thanks 😋
Here for a podcast  Not for the pr0n stars 👎👎👎
Like Sword Art Online Alicesizaton
I think I can speak for everyone when I say the food video Shane era was 🤌🤌
“If you’re watching this video…. You get it” nooooo I spit my fucking drink out lmfao oh my god. We made it ❤️
Wouldn't Shane be a Cub and Ryland be an Otter?
I f#*£8!? Love you guys!!! Love all the videos. You make me feel like we’re friends! Greatest ever
I know a lot of people may not agree with me but as someone who has been watching you since I was like 9 or 10 and I’m now 22, I missed your humor and random videos.
“I know you probably want a conspiracy video” no, we don’t want anything from you. Get off and stay off of YouTube, we don’t want any p3dos here
This video gave me so much fucking serotonin ! You have been missed, my guy. Please keep posting 🧡
😂😂🤣😅  🍕 me rei demaciado, welcome back Shane 🥳
I really don’t like Chris… I mean I think he’s sweet but he just laughed way too much when it’s honestly not even necessary
Ryland calling a snort a "honk" is one of the greatest things ever 😂
Awhh, if it makes yall feel better, I was engaged for 8 years ^^ You will find the right moment! And we ended up eloping in Tahoe because of similar worries as You, Shane :)
Shane if you bring back the fkn food videos I WILL CRYYYY!! DO ITTT!
Shane woke up and chose violance towards Chuck E Cheese
No way a conspiracy theory
I love and look forward to everything you post keep it uppp!!
Happy to see shane happy again
I need a ryland iml

If you make TIGHT PU**Y ENERGY into merch, I will buy it! Please do it!

Just woke up! I LOVE YOU SHANE!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
omg im so happy u guys r posting again i was dying laughing this video btw i think u guys would be super cool and good parents. =]
As person who works in kitchens and have made fresh pizzas. Cap. How does America get away with this 😂😂
I never comment on videos, but I laughed all the way through this video 😂😂
Missed you so much 🙌🙌🙌
I grew up watching Shane. I love him but I’m a little concerned for this podcast idea.. this whole beginning of the video was decently vulgar.
This was a conspiracy video and Also I want pizza now
Love you  💙💙💙
So he can come back anytime he wants but we still don't get our queen Jenna marbles back? Fine. Fine.
I feel like the trick for getting through to customer service is to either shout “customer service” or “real person!” Orrrrr hit “0” a bunch of times
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
guys, i just can't XDDD and umm.. Emma?
go away
I'm currently wearing my Oh My God hoodie as I watch this ❤❤❤ 8:48
Remember everyone Shane got cancelled for jokes so please never joke ever because its a trend to be upset about literally everything😂
The conversation with Ryland, Chris and Shane make me really uncomfortable
Oh hey it’s Jared

i love this video  i laughed so much
Listen, we just happy you uploaded! 💯❤️ we miss you
Welcome back💗💗💗💗
Yes my main man is back
not shane going : " I was cancelled and did self relflecting and I fixed it" WHAT DID U FIX? U JUST DROPPED THE F SLUR 10 MINUTES AGO
9:11 confirmation the Shane puts on the squeal, only to squeal 20 seconds later… ya’ll how can you not see through this
Is Shane gay or something ? Just asking
Isn't the logical explanation that they cut pizzas into parts when people order half/half or quarters and they put together the parts that are already made to make up new orders?
Yaaaaas! Totally here for the conspiracy podcasts 😁
What even is this video.
Love Shane's brother reminds me of my brother in law
?
Is it just me or does Shane look a little slimmer?? And omg I'm so happy u made another video Shane I MISSED UUU♥️
Dude honestly Shane comparing himself to pennywise killed me lmaooo
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 “if anyone would like to sponsor us”
Yessss 👑
It's 100% the content we want!! Missed you and your humour!! Glad you're back to the YouTube world!
YOU PAID 80$ FIR THREE PIZZAS!?!?!
Someone please link down the pushin P video 😂
GENIUS IDEA: Your wedding cake should be from Crumbl cookies. Period.
seeing the notification that you posted a video made my day, i love having you back shane 💕💕
I FREAKIN MISSED UR VIDEOS SOOOOOOOO GLAD UR BACK ME & MY KIDDOS LOVE U & RYLAND!!!
I just want you to know even though I’ll get lost in all these comments, I feel like your genuinely my friend. I’ve been here for a long time. And I am so happy to see where you are mentally and physically. I can’t wait to see more of whatever you decide to post, I’ll be watching. 💋
So are we all gonna forget everything????
Shane ❤️❤️❤️
love that Shane is back!!!
The first three minutes. Cringe 😬
I was hoping they’d be married in this silence of media but I just hope they find a good time to do it.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Savior, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all
Dude try and keep the camera still please. I feel sea sick watching this 😅🙈. Great to have you back Shane! ❤️
I love that I’m seeing you! I’ve watched your videos since before puberty and you are literally my love!!
I've never laughed so hard from a YouTube video 😂 Probably one of the only influencers with the same sense of humor as me and man am I glad you're back 🤣☠️ and I don't mean back as in posting videos, I mean back as in YOU are back. 💞
Just be yourself in the podcast! Im happy you’re back :) blessings to you and your new endeavors!
I love you Shane.

Welcome back Shane! 😊
Bruh ryland stuck by you this whole time, if you guys didn’t secretly elope yet you better do it soon before he gets tired of being bossed around Shane 💀
Youre wrong, this is totally what we want. This has been my fave video in a long time. ❤
Shane I would love to see a video on your thoughts about the new scream or just generally watching scream 1-5 and having a movie commentary
Adam's and eve would be the perfect sponsor 🤣🤣🤣
WE ALL NEED CONSPIRACY SHANE BACK, SO YES! ❤️🥲
Dont get me wrong, im aware of all the drama surrounding shane. I was very disappointed.  BUT FUCK ME AM I GLAD HES POSTING. i havent laughed in months, n watching tgis vid, i was in tears laughing.
The person playing me is an asshole lol like really dude I do stuff and am like wtf 😒
I always feel like I’m here talking with you, a friend, and I missed you very much. I am glad you are yourself again; it’s the P for me
I keep watching this for the O'Reilly Part XD
3 years, Jesus.
I love you and your video thank you for bringing some joy into my day!!
pushing p.
not shane dropping the f slur
Missed you Shane! You always manage to brighten my day <3
omg SHANE! I really miss you! Come back to youtube, Queen! ^.^
More videos please this was awesome
Shane:"chuck e cheese pizza is like family" Ryland: "blended family" lmao 🤣 😆
Shane being Shane ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Oreilly auto def needs to sponsor and I need that TPE shirt
When Chris almost did a nose dive up the stairs and Shane instantly worried about safety and here's Ryland "the oreo cookie is amazing" 🤣 I love these guys. Shane and Ryland remind me so much of myself. I'm so glad Shane has moved forward and stopped looking in the past and realizes he is loved and accepted by many for his true self. Screw the hate, and the haters be you baby always!!
I love this video and love that it's on the main channel!
Thankyou for 43 mins father
I can't cut a pizza evenly to save my life! I doubt they recycled pizza!
I love you 😂
https://youtu.be/MmxQR1qr6r4
not you showing up in my recommendations.  CHILDREN AND ANIMALS CAN'T CONSENT SHANE, stay away from the internet forever, thanks.
I wish you would do more videos shane :) I waited for my kids to sleep to watch this so that there was no distractions. And all day when I remembered there was a shane video waiting for me I got sooo excited!!
IDC what video you make I love them all!!!
yessss you uploaded 🤩
I am so excited to see you uploading again! I have been watching your content since 2008, when I was in middle school. A word of advice.. do not worry about what people want you to upload. Anyone who supports you will love what content you create as long as you are enjoying making it. ♥️ Much love to one of my favorite creators 😊
no bc I have seen the pig shirt at least once every time I've been to a goodwill/any thrift store in the past year
"I didn't think I'd make it 2022, is that not normal? Is that sad? ...If you're watching this video you get it." Haha I get it. 🌈 D e p r e s s i o n 🌈
Imagine a collab between Shane and Chuck e cheese.. this shit would sell in a heartbeat 😂
This is the best news !!! I was looking for the old Shane and friends podcasts and couldn’t find them omg Farrah Abraham time !!! I’m so so stoked !!!!
omg pls don't only get yes sayer on your team that edits your podcast because I don't believe that you wouldn't say anything offensive in this climate
Id take videos like this over conspiracy every day  hahaha😁
Omg i was not expecting this to pop up on my screen shane i so happy you are back i missed u so much i cant wait to go on this journey with you. I love you soo much❤❤❤
15 minutes in to the video and I still have no idea what the purpose of the video is. No idea why you talking about vaginas for 5minutes needs to be on the internet but okay.
It's this sense of humor that carried me through a lot. Just happy to be seeing more of you. Love ya Shane
Aww Shane I've missed you and your sense of humor so much! I've watched you for so many yrs. I think I've commented twice cause of my anxiety of people reading it and it sounding dumb as hell. ( Hope that's not creepy cause I just turned 40)😱..you are just such an amazing person with such a big kind heart. I feel like if we could ever meet, we would be bestie's cause of our morbid and weirdly big nasty way of thinking🤣🥰🤪 anyway, love you and always will!! Please don't leave us again🥺
So much love for you Shane! I’m so so happy you posted again and this video was INCREDIBLY well made! 😍 You work so hard to give us amazing content, thank you!  Sending so much love your way, so grateful for you and what you do. Never forget that you’re loved, you’re seen and you’re amazing!
😂😂😂😂
yay my 13 year old screaming! im28 now! YOU are my childhood lol
The beginning of the video about his new “conspiracy” video was such bullshit 🤦🏻‍♀️😂
PLEASE THE DISCLAIMERS LMFAOOO ?
I literally squealed and told my friend when I saw you uploaded!!! I’m so happy to see you back Shane ❤️
You gave me the weirdest pregnancy craving. Thank you for ruining my day lol
I’m sorry, but Chris doesn’t fit well with Shane. Shane needs a new camera person. I do not like his style of videography. It’s always so shaky and pans too quickly.
conspiracy theory      Has a ghost followed you around or just visited?
He’s back these video is so funny and made me so happy
Love you and whatever you make can’t wait to see what’s to come !

We missed you! So glad you're back <3
You know you have a problem when you watch this and know when it was filmed based on the Crumbl menu from that week......
I wanna see other pizza companies compared to Chuck
Literally so happy to see you again istg❤
I'm so unbelievably happy you're back! You have no idea!! <3
I missed this! More pls
You look so much happier i think that break was needed good to have you back !
change ur camera man or tell him to stop laughing sm its annoying
Shane Queen Dawson ❤
I lost it when ryland said “you used to honk” lmao what the fuuuuu😂😂😂
I didn’t want this video to end. I have missed Shane!
the king has returned
Iron Man Shane got me every time ♥
Oh i missed you haven't laughed this much in way tooo long!! <3
So happy his back !!! Please travel to do paranormal! Also Shane don’t hurt our ryland! That poor baby low key was hurt !
Wash your truck lol
I never knew someone could roll their eyes 8 times in 1 second but here Ryland is at 14:40 proving me wrong lmao
You’re my fave Shane 💕🥺
I feel so much better watching your videos. Love theories and all the laughts. Love from Poland♥️
I fucking LOVE you Shane
Happy to watch you and Ryland do absolutely nothing or do it all. I miss your old food videos too lol 😂
Im just happy you are still making videos.
Love you Shane
All my friends hate you I don't care you we're and still are my favorite YouTuber ever I've been following since 2015 or so and be mind I was in 6th grade ☠️☠️☠️ I'm a Senior in high school now and I'm so happy to see your content back
Gotta flip over the pizza and see if all the pizza is cooked to the same degree
Love it!
Go on Rogan!
I almost spit my coffee out just now when he said “cancel IT” 😂😂😂 I love Shane so much
Here for the Jamie Lynn drags 😄
Easy solution.  Ask for it to be uncut.
Idk ab their pizza but I got FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE FROM CHUCKE CHEESE AND IT ALMOST KILLED ME
time to get back to weekly uploads.
Yesss!! TPE all day long babyyy 😂😂 that was hilarious! I would love to see you doing more interviews/podcast shit. Brings back the mems without the drama lol
Podcast… yes please,  Also ryland! maybe the whole girly parts on you might be the whole baby thing, if you had one you would have your own little baby
you remind me of a friend i used to have that makes me wanna teabag a bear trap
I love it and missed you Shane❤❤❤ awesome seeing you again!
Super excited  for the  podcast  I don't care what ya'll talk about.  He's back!!!! 😀
Ryland doesn’t have stretch marks because he never grew! Just kidding! Don’t come at me! Shane, such a delight to see you laughing and being you again!
VEGAS WEDDING 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Hey person who is controlling me, could you increase my dopamine settings please?
actually crying at like 17:00 - im so happy you feel safe enough to come back i’ve missed you
You are honestly iconic
I just don't get it why you keep going with this pizza conspiracy, is just how they cut it 🙄so annoying
This made me so happy ❤️❤️❤️❤️
The question is, do the cut lines line up. The cutters are one big half circle so in theory the lines should line up from one side of the pizza to the other.
I am only 13 min into the video and i have been laughing out loud all the time! That is so so funny and chill. Honestly - really needed this today.
“chucke cheese is back… just like meeeeee” CRYING
OK I’ve made pizza and I’m noticing that all the ones you’re showing or half cheese half pepperoni and that’s why it’s messed up because they are cooking a whole cheese pizza and a whole pepperoni pizza and then they are cutting it on the cutting board and then they are taking half of the pepperoni and half of the cheese and throwing it in the same box
Glad your back!
Well I have another theory about the sizes of the pizzas....so what I was thinking was maybe they actually bake all their pizzas " fresh from oven" and when people order half and half they just take pieces from each pizza and put it together  and maybe that's why the pieces never really matches 🤔
Awww love you Shane!
Oh I missed the chaotic fun and sarcasm that this vlog entails! So glad to see you taking your time and coming back on your own terms! Although I do have to say, Colorado misses you!
This video was so great! Thank you Shane for coming back and reminding us how awesome you are!❤️
17H! #3 in trending!!!
Loved this video, so happy your back ❤️❤️
Meow 😸
I love how urgent care is in the same parking lot as Chucky Cheese.
Seeing you and ryland happy is exactly what we want to see. So happy you are making videos again, it made my day ❤️
I hate the camera guy
I miss u shane ur my highschool years ur content will always be the best
you're all so dillusional how can you all easily forget his past, just because "oh cute shane has humour like no one else!!!!" i seriously dont understand it please inform yourself on the things this man has done and STOP putting money in his pocket.
We want Conspiracy Theory videos Shane get on it please
serious wedding advice: SET A DATE!!!!!!! find a venue you like, see how many people it will fit, and what their availability is like. 100% easier to do everything else once you can start telling vendors and guests when/where to go. dont worry about how "wedding" it feels. we chose a bird sanctuary because it wasnt a basic venue, and it was so much cheaper than a traditional hall reception. using a wedding app helps to keep a list, and it populates all the things you could consider, and you tailor them to which ones you want to use. planning is the worst, part, but getting it set makes the rest easy.
Someone tell the cameraman to stfu
Ugh Ive missed Shane so much
https://youtu.be/onlRUpNpAok
:’)
Love you Shane!!!! I’m so glad your back and I can’t wait for conspiracies!!!!!!
Glad your back :)) x
The internet really loves seeing racists and pedos being platformed.
So weird I had a dream about Shane last night and he posted a video!
I get it.  The CA house is great (omg that BEDROOM!) and it holds some wonderful memories. But CO makes you both SO HAPPY..... it's like the CA chapter in your lives has ended so you can start a new one in Colorado 💜
The camera man makes me turn it off
You looked SO happy! And when you opened the box of pizza, I swear I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.
What do you mean this isn't what we want?! 43 mins of authentic Shane? Hell yes! I haven't laughed so hard in a while, thank you guys. Happy to know you're back!
Omg my excitement when I saw you had made a video!! Welcome back! You have been very much missed! So excited to see what videos you do in the future
Now I really want pizza.
Shane ur looking great!! Loving the video
Keep making content because I would watch anything you put out.
$80 for three pizzas?!? There’s the lawsuit
christmas is so funny i love him☠️☠️
I missed Shane so much!
Oh I missed him soo much. SO happy to see him happy, productive and creative.  Update : Fourth time watching this now lmao
Who else could just watch Shane for hours and hours? It could be about literally nothing and I’d be happy.. he brings joy and laughter into my life! ♥️
All of this "oh I should get to the point" should be... cut out of the video?
Finally you're back, its boring on here without you
At 11:10 all ryland makes me think of is the mum from mean girls ❤️
🍕SHANE! You and Ryland need to elope. Marry that man already. 💗🔥
YES DO A PODCAST PLEASE
Too funny!
Idk what “P” is but all Ik is that it’s new thing like “you’re pushin P” idk 🤣
1:37 Do you honestly still believe that democrats are better than Republicans at this point????  After all the mess they've created, and after all the disastrous policies they implemented especially against vulnerable little kids who still have to wear face diapers more than 6 hours a day and you still think this is ok you selfish hypocrite????   Keep up your virtual signaling it won't get you anywhere!  The SJW mob will be coming for you once again, it's just a matter of time.
I have watched you from the very beginning, and I’m so happy to have been apart of this fun rollercoaster right with you. I’ve always loved you, I’m so proud of all the things you have accomplished. And it’s been such an honor to watch everything you’ve done. I love Ryland too he is one of your biggest supporters and it shows everytime he looks at you! It’s a beautiful thing to see 🥰 love y’all! Keep it up great work, because I will watch it every time ❤️
I felt a way about the "it"* thing ... Sadly I can relate 😂
Keep going shane i love you so much and i missed you so much ❤️💕❤️💕
I love you so much Shane. Been here since the beginning. I wait for you to post everyday. I miss your face so much 😭
i'm just happy that you uploaded. please do post whatever content makes you happy 🥰 all the love and support Shane!! excited for the next vids to come! :)
I’m so glad you’re posting, I’ve missed you so much ! I’ve watched you for years and you helped me so much❤️
regardless of what you do, certain people are gonna pick you apart just cause they can.. so keep doing you & putting out what you wanna do!! 🤪🥺
Chris tries way too hard which sucks because I wanted to like him
We love you☺️💙😍
good to see u back shane
You guys ever see the videos of people cutting out a huge strip of pizza out from the middle and putting the pizza back together and cutting it like normal? This is what Chuck E Cheese pizza looks like.
Wait… when did the Mandela Effect switch back from Chuck E Cheese to Chuck E Cheese’s!? 😳 that “ ‘s” looks so out of place on the sign
Man I wish I had a picture we just had our sons birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese and everything was perfectly fine LOL the pizza was actually super bomb!
we love u shane so happy to have u back on youtube it’s been too long
Got us WAITIN’ damn, ready for that quality.
Love you Shane! Keep the vids coming!
If you're watching this, then you know🤣🤣 yes..I fucking know! I said the same.. Well I'm sure I'll be dead by 2022🤣 we made it lol
Any content is a must watch from Shane!!! Love you
Loved everything about this video. We just want more of Shanone, period! We will take what we can get! :)
I don't understand why this video didn't show up on my home page
I absolutely HATE cancel culture and I will ALWAYS stan Gabbie Hanna, Shane, and Jenna Marbles. Their sense of humor raised me.
well there's 43 mins of my life gone
Oh my fucking god I loved this so much and missed you so glad your back 😍
Chuck E. Cheese signature cut.
I loved this video! Also Chuck E Cheese is looking suspicious af, I've never seen a pizza so uneven before, what is their excuse? Sue me Chuck E Cheese I'm broke bitch
It's the word "finna" for me. Every other slang word makes sense to some degree but now they're just desperate and switching up random letters 😂
This is Shane, this is his humor and I love it. People trying to cancel him don’t get that this is the shane I fell in love with, I’m so glad he’s back and now I definitely will be logging on  to YouTube daily. I missed you and I can’t wait for all the new content you’re bringing. ❤️❤️❤️
Can I get a HELL YAH that Shane is BACK!
Yes!!! I missed your videos!! These creepy videos really get me thinking 😬
It’s great to have you back
MORE MORE MORE
Didn't know I needed this so badly 😭 🤣 🤩
💕💕💕💕
Oh my god we missed you soooo much 💗🥺
yaaaaaaaaaaaas 😍
Didn’t learn anything.
You should order a pizza and ask for it uncut and see what they give you
I'm just happy that you are happy and you are back. Your videos have helps me so much in my life! They always make me smile when I am down. I've missed you Shane. Thank you
This is crazy. It’s bringing me back to a simpler time. Since you were cancelled, I got a divorce and have been exclusively working from home… ALONE. Life feels so different.
Loooooove uuu!!!  You should open the pizza box upside down, so we can se the pattern on the dough 😙
If you're still curious about the Pizza... Watch the food theory video on it!
im shook
This brought me so much joy!
i've missed watching ur channel
SO HAPPY YOU ARE POSTING AGAIN!!
Señor Pooh …. lol 😂
Shane is the best friend I've never met. I really hope you go through with the podcast. I'm SO PROUD of you for pushing through everything and uploading again. I wish I could explain how therapeutic your content is for me, without sounding so weird that you would be suggest actual therapy lol. But I do love you, and Ryland, and I feel so lucky to have you back again ❤
I have missed Shane's videos so much. The conspiracy videos helped me through some of my darkest times of my life. I'm soooo happy they are going back
I haven't laughed like this in a while. Thank you, Shane. I really would love to hear more about your spiritual journey.
The person in control of my character must really like video games. Because he’s playing a life simulator just to spend all day playing video game. Lol
Start a Podcast please!!!!!
PLEASE make tight pu$$y energy a thing i need me a TPE hoodie rn
Why are u on youtube nobody forgot what u did bro :sob:
anyone else just keep glancing at the urgent care behind them in the chuck e parking lot?? 🥲 kinda ironic idk
Wait..... did I miss something? I thought the conspiracy stuff was doing very well. Why does Shane make it seem like something bad happened?
CONSPIRACY CONTENT LETS GOOOOOO
I miss the daily uploads of the wack ass videos😭 it was my favorite part of coming home from school.
I needed this, this brought me so much serotonin ☺️💕
It’s giving very much jeffree star. 😂
Happy to see him happy
I like the conspiracy jacket I want one
missed these so much
Bruh we want to see you in jail gtfo
Shane, I really still want you to make a horror movie. 👾
I feel like you guys should just elope! Ryland looks sad when the marriage gets brought up that it hasn’t happened yet. If you love him Shane, put your own fears aside and make his dreams come true for the both of you. He loves you for you, and just wants to be your husband!
I loved your video !! 🔥🔥🔥 it was so awesome 🔥🔥😂 really funny 😂 made my day 🔥
Shane. I missed u
Keep going Shane! We have 3 generations in our family, ages 14-65 that love you!!!
So happy to have my friend back!!! Missed you ❤❤❤
Mute Chris's mic! What's with all the noises he makes
Omg so funny and so glad you are creating again.💞💞
This got so fucking weird lmao I love it
I was NOT expecting the iron man at the end and I love it
we are losing the straight audience ... MARVEL!
Missed thisssss
couldn’t stop smiling the entire video missed you so much shane💗
Okay  1. I absolutely love your humor. I haven’t laughed that hard in a long time. Thank you for being here. Seriously.  2. Marry Ryland. Have the wedding. I’ll come. I’ll be a flower girl or the creepy uncle in the back who has had one too many.  3. I need honest answers as to why their pizza is like that. Like seriously. We’ve all used pizza cutters.. and even my first time using one, my pizza didn’t come out looking like that.. I made my own pizza once.. and while it looked absolutely ugly, it all still matched and lined up. Soooooooooooo????
8 on trending ???
I’m loving everything about this video. I’m so happy and so excited for you to be back. I loved you food videos and would love for them to get back ❤️🍰 and I’m so excited for the conspiracy video!!! (I’m I The only one that think Ryland looks amazing I this video!!??❤️)
missed you king
Start a new podcast please!!!! I’d die
P doesn‘t mean positiv. They probably meant the word Chris Hanson uses on his show so often…😕
"if you're watching this video, you get it" YES, yes i do LMFAOAOAOAOAO
Your videos make me so happy. ❤️
Omg words can’t describe how much Ive missed you soooo fucking much man ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love shanes humor
My dad yelled at me bcoz he thinks Im crazy bcoz IM LMAO ALMOST AN HOUR. LOVEYOU SHANE.
It's pretty cool seeing Shane be so interactive with most of everybody I'm kinda surprised he use to not really respond to that many people wich I get being a youtuber is a busy lifestyle and it's impossible to get to talk to everybody  plus people do have a personal life but I guess he's missed us that much that he's loving the fan interaction haha can't blame him he hasn't uploaded since last year glad to see you back bud I bet it feels great
It’s like “People of Walmart” but it’s Chuck E. Cheese in LA… 😂
Miss you Shane. Love to see you back!!!
No way they don't sue u again for this
1.6 million views in 16 hours.
Hi shane; I love you and im so glad that you're back 🥰🥰🥰
Honestly I cannot wait for the conspiracy video 💗 I love when you collaborate with your bro 🌈
shane needs to experience the flying pigs of cincinnati
Iove the idea shane. I'd stick to interviewing real people with crazy life stories. Celebrities are boring and have nothing good to say xx
Shane, I’ve been watching you since you got fired from Carl’s Jr. Since Shanaynay, Ned, hoe dini, S-Deezy & Fruitlupe(🤣still iconic). Your best video of all time was “evil lamb chop tried to kill me” 🤣.   It made me sad every time you posted an apology video. Not because you were ‘taking accountability’ or whatever. But because the woke cancel mob was at your doorstep. There’s a reason you garnished so much popularity from your old videos. YOU are funny & an infectious person to watch! Your loyal supporters know this and have grown with you over the years. We dgaf about trying to cancel you for some dumb thing you said 15 years ago. Please in this new chapter, stop apologizing. Stop second guessing. Be your authentic & weird & shocking self. Because that’s who we love! 💕 Welcome back!
https://youtu.be/E6LDoUBLlTs
Emma… send them a coffee basket!!! 😂
There’s just no way… I’ve cut pizza before too. I made pizza at Sam’s Club…. There is just no way that that’s what comes out when they cut the pizza.
I am dying lmao 🤣 my sides hurt!!! 😂😂😂 this is GREAT!! I love you both so much!! And I am personally SO frickin happy you are back!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This video is so funny
When you know all this already because you follow Rylands vlogs religiously 🙈
Shane love you but wow do you have to chill out and stay tf on subject you keep going back and fourth and it’s awful so hard for me to pay attention
This is everything I want. I love your conspiracy videos but something about this is so refreshing.
TPE ENERGYY IS DEFINITELY GONNA BE A NEW THING 🤣💯
YOU ARE LOVED
the ending is funny
someone tested pepsi for covid and came positive lol Love you shane!!!!
It's the 🅿️ for me...

Real sus that there's only positive comments here.
Watching in English class
Happiest I've ever been I miss you so much shane!!
🍕
So Happy I Seen This Notification!!! I Was Thinking Of Shane All Week! Now I Know I Was Senseing A New Vid LOL
watching shane after so long felt like coming back home after vacation lol
I would watch anything you create.
#3 on trending! Woot woot!
I love you so much! I'm so happy just to see you creating again💖
You'd love Ryland no matter what shape/form/gender, your love has no boundaries. Dreams have meaning. Or maybe you just wanted to know what his would look like, lol, talk about putting the snatch in snatched. I'll see myself out now lol
Missed you so much Shane , ily
I love you, Shane! Please don’t leave like that again. You cure my depression ❤️
🤍
new comfort video
I LOL’ed at WE MADE IT CHUCK E!!! Shane you give me so much happiness thank you for returning to the space.
is it weird that this made me hungry for pizza
I loved this! Thank you for making me smile today!
what was that???
Soooo... where do we find the podcast? I mean if you could do one today that be great... Lol. For real tho...u could talk or rant into the camera for hours and I would watch every second of it. U get me.
P means money darlin, like pounds x
There was a time shane was my favourite youtuber and now he doesn’t even cross my mind
We went to a Florida location a couple weeks ago and our pizza looked normal!
This video is so 🅿️!
Woowwww i couldn't stop laughing 😂😂😂
Omg I haven't laughed that much in awhile! 😂
I don't think I've ever heard gay men say the word pussy as much as you guys lmao
it makes me so happy to see you back. you seem to have reflected a lot and learned a lot. i used to watch you when i was at my worst and was going to end everything. now i’m still here years later and you still posting no matter how rare it gives me hope still. because we may have lived different lives and had different traumas we’ve shared some experiences. you’ve helped me grow and watching you grow makes me cry. keep growing shane everyday to be a better you till the end❣️
Shane this is such a 🅿️ video .. you made me so happy when I'm feeling like utter shit haha
Just wanna say when you cut pizza you loose a little bit of the surface area, which can account for the slight gaps. The best way to tell if it's two different pizzas is how the cheese/toppings look. Some would have a darker appearance, or half pepperonis missing etc  Also they hand roll the dough so it's very mismatched and I think it's likely the workers just don't care about making a complete circle. And that's the extent of the "bad cooking"
We want as much of u as u will give us!
Chuck E. Cheese pizza does taste really good
Cancel 'It'... Omg I can't 😂
The fact that Shane coming back is met with open arms.... at least. Going by this comment section. Preeeetty sure he's deleting comments lmao
Can we bring back that series where ryland dresses in women's clothes but he's like an alternative/emo girl😅😍😍
Welcome back, Shane!
Okay but the flirting with Chris was clearly making Ryland uncomfortable and he kept joking about it
Does anybody else find it HILLARIOUS that there is an Urgent Care right behind them when they're talking about the pizza? hahahahaha
The majority of the beginning of this episode is just shane flirting with his camera man blatantly infront of Ryland. 😳🤣
I still get sooooo excited when I use my Liquid Lip from your collection. It's something I'm very proud to own. 💜 You should be extremely proud of what you guys made bc it was absolutely amazing
Love this ,but I'm so glad there are subtitles I cant hear anything over the cameraman laughing !
I didn't laughed this much in a looong time 😂
More conspiracy theories
Here for whatever you put out 🤷‍♀️
I am here for any kind of Shane content!! Much love from a fan since the beginning!! ❤️
❤️❤️❤️yay!!!
Love your videos, I really missed you. For Chuck e cheese, maybe order and ask them not to cut the pizza. Then you will get a full pizza a not bits from others... You know? 🤔
I would definitely buy merch with Before you know you don’t know 🤣😂😂😂🤣
shane i’m so happy that you’re back i’ve been watching your videos since i was literally 12 and you and your videos are so important to me and i’m so happy to see you back on youtube thank you for you shane ❤️
Shane, I didn’t expect to be so hungry after this video! And it’s like 1am! I have many issues 😂🥰🌟👀🌈
We missed you Shane!! So happy your are back! You are so much happier 💜
Gotta say I was so hesitant to watch this video. But I laughed through the whole thing 😭
What’s funny is I know how long ago this video was filmed based on the Crumbl cookies you had 😂
Cannot WAIT for the podcast omgsh
Ok I missed how hilarious Shane could be loved the beginning ❤️
FINALLY!!!!! 😃
I don’t care if you hate Shane or not, you have to agree that his sense of humour is one of a kind and YouTube would never be the same without him 🥰🤣
Shane it is your wedding that means you get to wear what you want, marry that man and invite who you want. I'm renewing my wedding vows next December for our 20th I'm telling you I'm so introverted and don't like being around a bunch of people that will probably be about four extra people besides me and my husband
The Ironman mask ⚱️⚱️⚱️
OMG so excited that you said you want to do a podcast! I always thought you would be soooi good at that and I also love listening to things you talk about! Exciting!
Love you Shane...BUT LOVE LOVE LOVE Ryland most!!! But I love you too 🤣😜❤
Missed you, Shane!! 💕 - please make hilarious vids like this, god I was crying 🤣
00:15 How can the 5 senses be the controller's buttons if they are input and the buttons are output? This guy is the worst when it comes to explaining the simulation hypothesis...
Ryland looks beautiful 🥰❤️❤️love his hair like that
i love you!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don’t understand how people could dislike Shane or try to cancel him. He’s genuinely a good person and the people that don’t see that, don’t understand raw emotions and aren’t even fans so they mean nothing lol I’m so happy and proud of you Shane!! Keep killing it!!
Great upload, can’t wait for more. Even random ones
You did a podcast. You forget that your being recorded if you do it. Put trust in an editors to review it so you don’t fucking ruin yourself
I can’t wait for the podcast!!!!! I feel I am close and part of the fam bam even though we’ve never met. U are my level of dramatic and I LOVE IT!!! Sending so much love from TX!!!! Yeehaw
You guys should elope! That’s what me and my fiancé are doing next fall :)
Shane videos absolutely warm my soul !!! Shane you are legit my family ! Thank you ❤️
chris reveal plz
you should do a video on shifting realities for your conspiracy theory video
Thank you for coming back 😭😭🤎
Doeabthw "Rat" sell pizza by the slice by chance?? If so, maybe they take partial pizzas and add to it to make a whole?? 🤣🤣🤣
shane was lowkey mean to ryland
love you shane!! I hope if you’re reading comments, you see this one and remember it’s not always all bad. you’ve got this, we love seeing you back ! 😊
I missed you so Shane 😮‍💨🥺 happy to see you … I didn’t smile that much in a while 💋♥️👏🏼 thank u for that 💝 hope to see you very soon with new vids 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼♥️♥️♥️
I enjoyed it too Shane 😊👌🏽
There’s a video on food theorist about why there food is messed up
https://youtu.be/kUTRVI7KjZk 😊
Honestly I think we’re all just glad your back Shane. I really enjoy watching your videos especially the conspiracy ones.
$80!!??????
Elope in Colorado with your dogs!
Awh Shane I am so happy you're back with these kinds of videos, I haven't laughed so hard in a while! You always make me smile :)
great reminder to unsub
ask for the pizza to be uncut. if they refuse, you are probably on to something.
I actually liked this video, (a bunch of people did too.) I guess that's why it's #3 On Trending.
If there were daily adds with 17 adds I would watch everyone one and be like “I’m helping” the whole time 😂 I wish I was joking
No lawsuit here! Keeps putting up messed up pizza photos😂
The fact you’re still hanging on to the thin strand of what’s left of your career is so sad. And what’s even more sad is the yt girls who still support you. 💀
Please just marry ryland
Welcome back ❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️ the pizza is sometimes from different pizza but not recycled. They sell by the slice so I have seen them pull from 2 pizzas to make a whole. Also if you order 1/2 and 1/2 on one pizza they make one whole one of each (because they can sell the individual slices) and give you half of each.
I’d love to see some more mandala effects!
So so so glad your back can’t wait for 2022 for you💕💓
freak
I'm SOOOO happy you went back to Chuck E Cheese!!
love u shane
this man got a whole truck 🤣
Canceled Anonymous hahahahahah
👏🏻HONEY👏🏻 you could upload a 1 hour video of yourself talking about a pillow you bought & I’d pop some popcorn, grab a Diet Coke & be ALL over that. Keep being you. 🦙💛🐝🍯
Not gonna lie this is my 2nd time watching this immediately repeated it I really want some Chuck E cheese pizza you're welcome Chuck E cheese tell Shane thank you.   this video was so awesome ,I laughed all the way through it was just like I was chilling with my buddy Shane and his wonderful fiance and super christopher Robin.
WE ARE FRIENDS CHUCKY😂😂😂 love it Shane
I can imagine y’all have crumble instead of a wedding cake!
I loved this Shane!!! I can't wait to see more videos from u!! Whatever content u put out i will always watch it!! I am so happy to see ur back! ❤️
This is the content I love. Random but makes me happy start to finish. Keep it up Shane!
I missed watching you Shane so much. I can't tell you the last time I laughed so much. You are still the queen of comedy and I'm so happy your back.
Shane you have not lost your sense of humor at all- this was hilarious and everything the world needs.
So happy to see you!
20 min for pizza isn’t unusual for pick up. And $80 for 3 LARGE???? THAT’S ridiculous!
Im surprised I don't see any negative comments :o
How you still manage to be rasict trc
God loves you! Jesus died for your sins!
God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son for whoever believes in him can have eternal life. John 3:16
#3 on trending 😋
Blended family 🤣🤣🤣
YES FUXK YES
I was laughing from beginning to end. Loved it. Love to see you back and happy. God bless
I'm all for Shane coming back and like watching his videos but..... There's a lot of people that will be here just to drag him and it's a little weird that there's only positive comments. Haven't seen one negative comment.
Shane 😂 know he’s a man he’s hilarious
This was hilarious!!!!! Make these videos once a week!!! #MoreShaneDawson
IVE MISSED YOU OMFG! Stop
I’ve missed shane
Shane I love you so much at the end of August I almost took my life due to not feeling enough you have been an example that you can get through anything I’m so glad you came back to YouTube and your videos bring me so much joy
i missed your content bae!!!
Shane make more videos!!!!! We miss you
I'm soooo glad you're back around, I used to watch your videos everyday for so long and it saddened me to see you disappear, but I know you needed that time away for yourself, I really hope it made you feel atleast a bit better, we love you Shane and we missed you <3
At this point anything is better than nothing but we crave conspiracy theories 😒😒😒😒
Looking forward to many more videos Shane !  Can’t wait for more conspiracy videos
Or is he manifesting a Rebirth 🧐
I’m so proud to say that I supported acne through good and bad, when he was at his lowest I continued supporting and buying his merch
your black handbag & hats are so cute i need to save up 😭
HIS NAME SHOULD BE CHRIS CRUMBLE
Yes bestiee 😽💅
You should also make more ghost/ haunted videos. Those are really good and interesting that you made. Love the editing flair you have!! :) Stay awesome!! :)
Damn chucky, you did it again 😂😂
This is exactly what I wanted
❤️
You should hire one of the selling sunset ladies and make that a series!
You could make a video about absolutely nothing and I would still be laughing hysterically ❤️ y’all are awesome!
Shane and people around him are so funny and entertaining. I was laughing loud when walking on treadmill in the gym. Can't wait for the podcast 👌🏼
I MISSED YOU
*Groundhog Day sponsored by Chuck E. Cheese*
I have missed you so much!! Thank you for still being here and brightening my day.You have such a beautiful soul and it makes me so happy to see an upload.I have watched your channel for 6 years and you got me through the darkest part of my life.Truly thank you❤️
PLEASE DO CONSPIRACY THEORIES OF COVID/vaccine!!!
Ps. Chucky chz better leave u the fuck alone. We stand with Shane. If they try Shane again then boycott them. Bc they should feel lucky for all the PR from his video.
I missed your videos!!! Hiii!!
🌈I'm so damn happy to see you back!!! Thank God and it's been way to long! Love it🎉  But thanks for the small conspiracy. (CCP) BUT CAN'T WAIT FOR THE  CONSPIRACY VIDEOS.
How’s this for a conspiracy; if you order pizza from Pasquale’s…your get Chuck E Cheese pizza & merch…..
I haven’t laughed in a while . missed you Shane ♥️
you look so happy, I laughed all the time. So glad you are back with this amazing energy.
perfect way to start the way :) with a new shane video!!!
thank you for saving my day! its always fun to see you guys joking around :")
EXCUSE ME!! A PODCAST?!?!! YES YES YES YES YES YES
I am so happy that you are back 😊. You are like that kid in school that says he did not do well on a exam, but everybody knows thats not true 😀 but about your videos.
This was such a great and funny Vlog!!!!!!! Thank you!!!💖
I’m so glad Shane’s back I missed him and videos  I’ve been watching since he started I love him no matter what anyone says he’s amazing!!!!
It literally looks like they cut the dough in to slices and THEN added toppings and THEN baked it so it looks like the dough was rising as separate pieces so they don’t fit in a circle correctly??? Maybe?????
Have you ever seen or tried Randonautica Shane? Should give it a look and a try feel like it would be a great video
Shane comes back & is already #3 trending that shows how much we missed you!
Missed you shane 🖤
This video is sponsored by Chuck E Cheese.
hoho
"I've heard that.... it's in the beans" 🤣
I'm feeling really sick and I might have COVID, but this is exactly what I needed to feel a little better, I haven't laughed that hard in a long time
Lmaoo deadass. When he said we’re losing all the straight audience. I was about to click off Bc I got bored. But then he said marvel and stayed Bc I love marvel hahah 😂
Pushin 🅿️
Shane post whatever you want! This is your channel and who cares who watches?? I’m here for all of it and I LOVE it 😻
I mean ofc they're going to deny it even if it is true, but how do they make sense of this??? What would be s good explanation for why their pizzas look like this!??
Please make many more videos like this, i miss you guys, and i miss laughing with youguys!
I was dying of laughter the whole video
Go away again
💙💙💙
love watching shane be ridiculously disrespectful to ryland for 40 minutes. hard to watch. wtf.
So good to see my favourite youtuber happy and just living life🤍 I really missed Shane
I prefer this! This is great. I am a newer viewer and you are hilarious!
I loved it oh my god
Didn't you used to HONK 😂❤️
Yessss SHANES BACK I MISSED YOU!!!
😍😍❤️❤️❤️ Te Amo Shane!!! Love to see you back!! 😘
The only problem with this video is that Chris was very shaking.. no shade but it was very noticeable
Missed you so much Shane 💖
where you go “2022 never thought i’d make it just like you we made it we here together” or something i literally went BRO WE NEVER THIUGHT WED MAKE IT
So excited your posting again! Me and husband made dinner and watched your video! We laughed so hard!
P
Is it just me that has dreams where I'm secretly somehow related to the Kardashians or they're my sisters / cousins and I'm hanging out with them totally normal 😂 I'm always sad when I wake back up to my whack ass life. Also marry Rylan please!!
I'm so happy 😊
This is exactly what I wanted! Love your content. So funny!! Can’t wait for the next one!
ANY VIDEO FROM YOU IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT! :) I LOVE YOU <3
I'm starting my Wednesday morning with a cup of coffee & Shane <3 -- love ya buddy.
Shane lost so much weight! I love you Shane!!!!
THE IRON MAN AT THE END 🤣🤣🤣🤣 im weaaaaak
so glad your back mised you and your videos  watchin u puts a smille on my face hate all the things that people draged up reckon it was tottally out of line were all human and all make mistakes
It never fails. Shane makes me smile so much! Thank you!!
what if you did a podcast that incorporates everything you love  where you interview and maybe live a day like people and their lives that no one sees kind of a "life behind" you can do things from your conspiracies to like other underrepresented people or hard to see stuff like mental illness or drug addiction or being gay or trans in the bible belt. kind of like "life behind the backdoor" kinda stuff where you can  interview your friends and things you want to talk about. could make an icon like twilight zone door with your conspiracy icon on it..call it "though the backdoor" or "Shane's Backdoor" or something related but double entandre  that makes it funny...but im honestly glad to see you all reenergized and happy and ready to go back to doing the things you love
Missed you Shane love your videos 🙏🏼
I believe Shane truly loves Colorado; however, it seems like he is happier in LA? His whole esthetic seems more bright in Cali. Compared to other videos, yanno.
Nice to see Shane again! Welcome back 💕🇨🇦💕
finally you’re back!! the video was so funny just like old times 🥰
SHANE THE SMILE ON MY FACE IS HUGE. YOURE BACK!!!! 😭😭😭❤❤❤I HAVENT UNSUBSCRIBED OR UNFOLLOWED ONCE. 2022 IS A GOOD YEAR
i love how the pizza was obviously not all from the same pie but shane and ryland tried to hype them up so they don’t get sued 😂😂
I want whatever you post Shane! I'm easy to please 😎😎😎
PLEASE MAKE A PODCAST
SO happy to have you back, Shane and so happy to see you and Ryland both happy and healthy! 😄❤
missed ur videos. :>
please please do conspiracies again!
So so so excited to have you back 🥰 I have missed this chaos
A conspiracy video on simulation… keep it in the drafts…
I missed you and your videos so much. omg. Why oes he always have the funniest camerapeople??? Laughted so much in the first 5 minutes..... Love u. Missed u. You got this!
The fact that there's an urgent care next to a chuck e cheese says a lot lol. Get sick from eating the fucked up pizza and then literally walk to urgent care after lmfao
Hilarious. I love this still your content you make. Not everything has to be a big fancy video
I’m confused.    What is this????
im so sorry that i dont like him, the content he makes is good, but i still dont like him or what he did
love you!
Damn, guy playing my game is annoying AF.
I missed you!!!!! I’m glad to see you’re back! I loved this video and I can’t wait for more like it!!!!!
i’m so happy you’re back. i haven’t laughed this much from one video in so long<3
Omg, I Laughted the whole damn video. Shane your hilarious 😂.  I love the content. Can't wait for more. Podcast would also be a success 😊
this video is nothing but epic
Shane pleas e a request MAKE CONSPIRACY THEORIES HOW YOU USED TO MAKE THEM!! not in a rude way. I miss the simple on the couch guy
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Shane!!!! I’m so happy for you. You’re back❤️
What would happen if you orders a whole uncut mozzarella pizza? Would they give you an uncut one? And if you order only one "flavour" of pizza but sliced, would they all match? Is the issue only with the half and half ones?
Tight!
I swear me and Shane are the same person but he has money and hope.....
maybe the pizza gets cut before baking..
Freaking love u Shane, missed your videos.
The bacteria 😂 🦠
Luv you Shane, real talk, I wish you can make a serious reflective video on the whole cancel culture situation, may be write a book? Idk, it will show your growth and give a real insight into your life.
You need a crumbl cookie cutter! They sell them there at the counter
hi shane thanks for uploading glad to to see your doing well we missed you
there’s an urgent care right behind shane at chuck e. cheese 😭😭
I might be the only one that isn’t a fan of conspiracy videos or like scary videos but the comedy is so great! I found myself laughing out loud through most of the first half of the video.
i do miss shane this made me happy
Maybe they just suck at making pizza crust 🤷🏻‍♀️
All I have to say is   this video is "P" lol!
this video is so unfunny it’s honestly embarrassing
I'm just happy to see I don't care if it's something exciting or you just chilling with Ryland

We never got passed the gas last
it was the ''what does pee mean?'' for me
Shane is so talented I will watch anything he shares with us. Happy to see him back in action ❤️
Shane will not get married or engaged or anything else because he is the same personality that I have basically we do things psychologically that we know are wrong for a relationship so we do those things knowing that our relationship can’t be the corner stone of our relationship we will pretend and put fronts out that show we care and love them but that’s only protecting our bad side our evil side I don’t know how to make this any more clear unless he wants to interview with me and I ask him the hard questions guess what he’s not going to and guess what you’re not going to read this and find out that I would also answer the questions so what he hard questions are hard to find I have them all question is do you have what it takes to answer the hard questions most likely not
so lame now
Happy you are back!!
the QUEEN is BACK!!🥰🥰 Sending lots of positivity your way darling, we all missed you! Lots and lots of love from the UK 🇬🇧💖
…does that mean they won’t be having their kids birthday parties at Chuck E Cheese?
Kroger in Dallas sells Chuck E. Cheese pizza in the frozen section at Kroger grocery store. Y’all should compare the frozen pizza and the take out version 😂
Didn't ask
Why are u guys acting like Shane isn’t problematic anymore?😀😀
Well i'm going to be saying #TightPussyEnergy 100/day for a week
I’ve watched the first minute and I already know this is going to be stupid. The voice inside your head controlling everything is you. Shocker
I don't care what people say I missed Shane's humour so much, i couldn't stop smiling for 43:23 minutes made my day completely
Poor from u
I'm honestly so glad you're back Shane ♥️
This is EXACTLY what we want!!!!! Xxx
Ryland is so unintentionally funny! He's the funniest when he doesn't try 🤣
It’s Rylands Caucasian definition of “keeping it 🅿️” fa meeeeeee 😂😂😂❤️y’all are hilarious
You have no idea how excited I get when I see you've posted a video. When I watch you I feel like I'm actually with you 😩 Your like my best pal even tho you don't know me 😭🤣  also your looking great alot more healthier. Welcome back 🙏
Oh man im glad the show took a turn after that first minute. Ohh its good to be here 💛💛💛
I fucking love Shane…..love how risky he is…like he has a law suit against him and he’s still going after them!!! I love it
I'd kill for that kill Bill tee shirt 😍
I can't believe this video passed a lawer LOL also... I'd buy "before you know - you don't know!" merch.
Shane,  watching your videos years ago, got me through a dark stage in my life. I’ve never stopped watching or loving you.  I get your humor, it matches mine.  Love from Atlanta, a fellow bisexual 💜. Ps. I still have all my merch. Screw the haters!
Lol, I wonder if every store has picture of Shane on the banned for life list, you know like a list of bad checks written 🤔   OMG that is too funny. I wonder if when they are slicing pizza, if they may be cutting out pieces to eat in kitchen before it's served?
Mattpat did a video on his food theory Channel on why this happens, and its basically because the way they move the pizza from the oven to a cutting board isn't the smoothest so while it's still extremely hot it moves around a bit, and also the cutter they use is incredibly dull for safety reasons, and the force thy need to push down with to cut it also moves it out of place while it's still so hot and that force compressed the pizza in on itself a bit
shane im a random girl from england but i promise to be entertaining and cheap
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 i love it lol
LET ME TELL YOU I WAS CRY LAUGHING AT MARVEL THING
I was interested till I realized I’m too high for this
Shane, my mother has been making pizzas at her work for several years and never came out like this. It is she who makes everything from making the fresh dough to delivering it to the customer. There is no reason possible for them not to come out round and perfect. She does it all by herself for many people.  +  I love your videos, I cried from laughing so much
I feel bad you can’t look at all your JSC products and merch without feeling sad. You did that. You should be so proud of what you achieved! Because it was all so damn amazing! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Shane!! I’m so happy that you posted 😊😊 I’m 38 weeks pregnant with my first baby and I’ve been feeling so anxious and nervous lately. Watching your video took my mind off everything for 40 minutes today and it was just what I needed. Will definitely listen to your podcast and I can’t wait until you post again ❤️ love u and Ryland ☺️☺️☺️
I'm really not into conspiracy videos but I would love any other videos you do! 💗
My theory is that theyre cutting the pizzas all the way for kids to be able to easily grab a piece, pizza places dont completely cut it all the way to keep it from shifting in the box. Thats my theory on why chucke is different. (Tho ngl, doesnt excuse some of those pizza pics)
Wait that’s the name I got it, if it’s not already taken, Canceled podcast
i hope the worst for you
so disabled people without these senses are given the little brother controller.
Soooo great seeing new vidoes from you, Shane. More conspiracy stuff would be great. Chuck E Cheese pizzas are seriously suss. Thanks so much for the laughs, really needed them.
Love you Shane!I´m so glad you´re back :) You´re still hilarious! lmao
Pushing P😂
Shane come out of the anti masker closet.
Who said that we dont want theese kind of vids shane is better funny any ways🤨🤨
I appreciate you still making an effort to do the thing you love despite the haters
One of first YouTubers I ever watched and still supporting you to this day. Can't wait for more videos in future 👍🏻😁
so happy that your trip to LA gave you some inspiration to create again it's a full circle for you love that
There was a literal moment in my head where I told myself “it’s probably going to be a normal pizza. It’ll be good.” The CACKLE I had when you opened the pizza boxes 🤣 I can’t. I’m dead. 🤣  I loved this video so much, thank you for this 🤣💖
This video was hella 🅿️
Omg 😍😍😍😍 a podcast 🎉🎉🎉🎉looovvve💃💃💃💃
About time!
I'm happy you're back Shane. You're still my favourite Youtuber after all these years.
Yaaas! Been waiting with my partner and friends for this moment. So excited
i’m sorry, shane is so funny! regardless of everything, he definitely has unmatched comedic energy and it’s BOMB. stay mental sane shane!
Really glad to see your brother back too! Intelligent and interesting perspective
Did you ever think that maybe Chuck E Cheese got the ball rolling on you being cancelled?
Literally came one hour earlier to my office just to sit, eat breakfast, and watch Shane. PERIOD
The king of YouTube is back
I know you’re career is coming back together and you’re doing all these nice things and may think you swept everything under the rug but we didn’t forget and we’ll never forgive you.
Honestly feel you on the wedding thing shane. Im terrified to find a dress next month.  I want to get married,  but planning is so stressful without help. Not to mention the financial burden.  As long as you guys are happy that's what matters.
I'm soooooo happy you're back!! 🥳🐷 This was hilarious. At first, I thought you'd borrowed Jeffree's Chris!! 😆 I love the randomness of this video! Please make more!! 😘❤️
Ive been engaged for like 11 years...we have kids too.. N just don't care about the wedding either. Financially it actually is better, sad way of the world.
stay off YouTube shane
Just wanted to tell you Shane that I’ve prayed for you for many years. You’re very loved.💕
I'm recovering from what I think is food poisoning and this feels like my medicine. And I feel like shiiiiii! But this is  helping 😊   And no I didn't eat any pizza from that place.. That shall not be named.. no lawsuits!
The title has got to be a jab about the Snapchat articles about him 😂
Petition for ryland to wear those shoes more lol
I’m going to go against the grain here. Likely because I’m an older woman. I found the first part a tad vulgar for my liking but nothing I couldn’t skip through.
we need the conspiracy videosssss <3
“Someone” 🙄 said this was an awful boring video. What a bullshit hater because I love this video! Im so happy that you’re back 🤗
I love that there is a Urgent Care in the same place as Chuck E Cheese 😂
My player needs to man tf up
This was one of the funniest videos I’ve see in a WHILE! Of course it was the KING himself👑 so happy ur back! Can’t wait for a conspiracies, PODCASSSSTS and spooks and let’s not forget the potential horror movie making ?! GAH! Cannot WAIT. All the luv from Canada ♥️♥️♥️
Shane is pushing 🅿️
this was EXACTLY what we needed! welcome back :)
I'm so happy to see shane back!!! please keep creating anything I love it<3
I've been watching you since I was a kid and I've never stopped  I absolutely love u Shane and I'm so glad that your back. Much love ❤
I will watch literally anything you post and enjoy it thoroughly- for what it’s worth
Shane, no matter what video you bring out it always brings a smile on my face! No matter what you do you’ve got to know all of your fans will always enjoy it!! I have missed you so much
shane driving a ute is everything, he kills
I think other pizza companies use frozen crust? Maybe if they do make it fresh... people just can't make a perfect circle. Not that half the video is serious lol but just thinking.
Why are all these comments so positive?
I so love his humor. Makes my day!
In the last 12-ish years, many other youtubers have come and gone in my life, but not once have i gotten fed up with Shane. At this point, i don't think it's going to happen. I'm in this as long as he is. Here's to everyone's mutual happiness.  As for the pizza... maybe they just have huge shelves of pre-made stuff and then just grab random slices and heat it up on demand? Because the half and half pizzas are literally two different halves, it's not one pizza with two different toppings. So the other halves have to end up somewhere? Such a weird production choice though.
Why did this remind me of a Jackie and Deborah video!!?? Loved!
That Chuck E Cheeses 🅿️ tho…
The best notification i've gotten this year.
Shane I love you so much regardless of everything I always will be a big fan of yours and I’m so happy you’re coming back to yourself and making videos again 💛💛💛💛 I love your funny dark humour and your personality 💛
Yes SHANE whooo! "We made it Chucky!!!!!" Hahahahahaha.
Why not just ask the restaurant not to cut the pizza?
Is someone filtering these comments or has everyone just forgotten...
I missed you!! I love your vids and your energy 🤍
comfy old videos<3 happy that ur back shane
Still the king of youtube 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
missed ya shane
meow
I haven't laughed so hard out loud in a long time and it felt honestly just really nice! I am so happy you're happy, Shane!
It's so weird seeing you guys in the old house after seeing you in the new one for a while lol like I keep feeling like I'm watching an old video that I somehow didn't see at that time 😂 so weird. Glad you seem to be adjusting well! ❤
https://youtu.be/6F_FIfxPFs4
I love the Urgent Care across the street from the Chuck E Cheese! Lmfao
So glad you are back baby!
If they sel by the slice they could pre cut pizzas and then someone orders a whole one and they just add slices to make it a whole pizza
Definitely post the psychic reading recording!👏
OMG loved this!! I was laughing out loud!! Can’t wait for more and your podcast 😊

yasss shane daily videos with seventeen ads😉
*Plot Spoilers*: Shane and crew just go to Chuck E' Cheese's again and get some more Pizza,There is no lawsuit now you don't have to waste your time on a Click-bait title your welcome.
The fact that there is an urgent care in the background while they’re in the Chuck E. Cheese parking lot killed me😂😂 it just fit perfectly
So happy you're back on YT!!! You helped make it what it is!!! And there is wat too much crap content now!! So you are NEEDED!!😂😁 Glad you're in such a good space, too.  Happy for you❤️
Fuck this guy y’all really just canceled him like last year right
Wash the damn truck Shane lol 😂
Too much vagina in this video kinda annoying
I laughed so hard! He is so funny!

YASS!!!!
Hell yes I have my comfort YouTuber back 🥺👉👈
Y’all should definitely go to Disneyland and video it!
He doesn't even know how much we love him and how much we miss him when he's gone
Awww yay your back!!! I can't wait to see what you have in store for future videos
You have no idea how happy your videos make me. Thank you shane. Glad you're doing better ❤
I’m only six minutes in and just want to write down “Chris Crumbl (Kringle)” as a nickname nomination. 😁
you Look great shane. you've made my day that your back
All I’ve been craving is Chuck E. Cheese pizza during my pregnancy. I just like the crust flavor and crunch. 😋 plus the salad bar 😋🤣 damnit Shane now I have to go get some even though I just had Chicago’s pizza yesterday
Shane you’re trending! We missed you🤍
Shane, I missed you and your humor sooooo freaking much! I love this kind of videos & I am personally extremely hyped for the next conspiracy video. 👁️ greetings from germany 👋🏻
Why didnt they have you do a video of you working there or watching their kitchen for a day so they can clear their name
What happened to the other camera guy?
Okay but who orders pizza from Chuck E. Cheese
U really r kinda creepy
So happy 💕💕
I thought you were gonna call him Chris Crumbles 😂
80 dollars for 3 ppizzas????????????????????????????? good to see you back shane f the haters they always wanna take people off their high horse get back on and ride it till there about to bust then snap it off. love you byeeee

I'm sooo happy you're back, Shane!<3
Yay…. He’s Back 💞💞💞💞

I love your Kill Bill shirt ❤
Russia withdraw! how about let's make Ukraine attack Russia!  yeah , we know Ukraine president want that!  because G7 will give Ukraine more help!
Dear Shane Dawson :  You are a legend 🌹💐❤️
I don't skip the ads for shane and the gang. I just love you guys.
In 3rd grade we got Chuck E. Cheese personal pizzas for lunch and they were all moldy 😂
we probably want a conspiracy video....
Every time Chris is there, Shane hits on him and then Ryland gets understandably upset 😬 I didn't like how Shane called his own fiance the "F" word. I'm starting to think maybe Shane doesn't want to get married to him after all lol
honestly ever since you stopped making content I struggle to find something to watch on YouTube
Shane I love you and missed this a lot. There is no one like you. 😘
WE HAVE MISSED YOU SO MUCH
Why not just ask for an unsliced pizza
Omg I'm literally crying i love your potcast so much and I've seen every single one of them can't wait to see more xoxox
Love thie videooo 😭😭
Thank you for putting out videos. They definitely put a smile on my face for a prolonged amount of long time. Cant say that about many things these days. Best wishes to you mate!
YES THANK YOU I LOVE YOU. SO EXCITED FOR THIS PODCAST
this video made me so happy
Out of youtube jail I see
God please just stay off the internet 🤢
This video made my week. So excited to see you again 😭❤️
YAAASSSS bearsss
Just watched this video on the way to work and omfg I was dying of laughter
OMG SHANE HAS THE SAME RINGTONE AS MY DAD HAHA
My comments about cats keep getting deleted lmao
I love seen Ryland getting jealous 😂
I woke up and am now having the best day ever!!!! Im so happy your back!!!!!! I love you guys so much!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg Shane’s reaction to seeing chuck e cheese for the first time in forever was my reaction when I gave birth to my daughter : “omg this is so weird! This is so weird!” Ten times  “Omg did she see me? Can she see me?”
Ryland was like "we ain't finna get a lawsuit todaaay" 🤣🤣 I love you guys ! I'm so glad your back shane
Shane I love your vids and pls keep doing it fan from Philippines
This needs a pg warning
The end card!! I can’t I loved it even the fonts for everything being more relaxed!! I loved it and I missed you ❤️
My dreams came true another video of my hero! Love you soooo much Shane!
I love you so much Shane 😍🐷😍 I will watch anything you upload. Everything you do is amazing 😘 I've missed you so much, I've been binge watching ur videos since you've been gone.
“You haven’t done it in a while” as if Shane didn’t *honk* every time he laughed the whole video 😂
Loved it! I’m guessing it’s not really a mystery about the pizza, and Shane just likes to “parody” about it? Cause it’s obvious they just cook multiple pizzas at once all the time and put them together when people order, but they can’t say that cause then it goes against “fresh to order”. So it’s “old”er pizza but not recycled.
OMG Shane WE SURVIVED!!!!!!!!!!! And the repeated Disclaimer!!!! I AM DECEASEDDDDDD and you should've all 3 walked out in slow motion in the Outfits!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
❤
Glad you’re back 🤗 Looking forward to more fun times!!!
Watching this as a trans man is fucking wild lmao 😂 cis gays are wack
I have missed this so much. We're bringing 2017 to us!!
I am SO ready for more conspiracy videos from you!!!! Your conspiracy videos always bring me back to some of the best years of my life and I would love to watch some new ones from you:)
Bruh. Chuck E Cheese's still hasn't learned after the first time. You'd THINK someone with 20M subs exposing them like this, they'd change their ways and make an actual normal pizza. The ONLY way I'd be eating one of their pizza's is if it's not precut. That way, they HAVE to make it fresh.
Tight throat energy 🥸
oh my god shane looks so happy and healthy this was hilarious i was laughing and smiling the whole time😭so unbelievably excited when i saw he posted
It's this sense of humor that carried me through a lot. Just happy to be seeing more of you. Love ya Shane
Love seeing how happy you are lately and cant wait for your future podcast and new videos ♥️
Cinger fat
I’ve always liked the conspiracy videos & conspiracy deep dives. If you put those out I will definitely watch them!
We need more more more conspiracy videos brother 😀
Hearing Shane and Ryland talking about 🅿️ is exactly what I needed to start my day
shane pls never leave, you really are my comfort person and your videos give ME LIFE, love you <3
Lol this video had me rollin! I loved it!! Great to have Shane back. Can’t wait for more  conspiracies! 😁
it was the awkward "I'm not a doctor." for me. Happy you're back Shane!
This mans went down 5 mil subs in a year lol
Please tell Ryland not to let your dream worry him, I'm a straight female 🤔 (I think) and Ive dreamed of my husband having a V in the past. Just exploring my dreams 😁
Wow 1M views less than a say 😍😍😍love you Shane
🎤🌏MY music Deserves a listen🔥♾ Im Living In Jacksonville Florida as i Type This
Im so happy you Are back ❤️ my mental health really missed you 😂❤️
I am glad you’re back!  Looking forward to more fun videos!
the emma chamberlain mention lmfaoo
Those pizzas still look a little weird but I will say 20 minutes is totally normal to get pizza ready if you're not busy. I worked at a pizza place and it only took 10 minutes to make an order from scratch if it was a slow day.
Shane: talking about missing vaginas Also Shane: let’s go to the ✨beauty room✨
This was such a fun video!
🐽🐷
the HAPPINESS this video brought me omg
What happened to their old videographer?
Maybe they are trying to teach kids about obtuse and isosceles triangles! Baahaaa!!!
Chris Crumbl might work for his nickname.. glad to see you back!!
I hope you talk about your spirit guide and psychic experiences on your podcast!
OMG HIIIIIIIIIIIIII !!!!
Welcome back Shane ❤️ lol 💡 Chuck E Cheese collab making a pizza together lol why it’s different shapes. Haha I remember when I went to get a pizza and did a video lol because of you 😂 I drove 2 hours just to go to Chuck E. Cheese lol can’t wait to watch more videos!
Here we go. Another creator thats decieving a mass of their viewers lol
More conspiracy theories
You can have your throat stretched medically. 😵 lol.
Please keep putting up content. There was a time when your channel was the only source of happiness in my life. ♥️ I hope to see more of your videos.
I will watch anything you post Shane, don’t trip about anything :) also love the whole “blended family” thing because we all know CC is SUS
i love u
Missed youuuu ❤❤ so glad u r back. Love youuu
I think you are made for podcast land Shane. You will be wonderful at it <3
DYING for Shane to do Covid conspiracies, but I genuinely think that would cause a bigger lawsuit🤣🤣
I haven't laughed this hard in along time! 🤣 I've missed your videos and all of you guy!! ❤ can't wait for more videos to come!!!
Adam and Eve brand deal!!!!!!!
Love the video amazing 👏
Maybe they cut it before it's cooked . That would explain why it's different shapes . Some of the dough would shrink if it is cut before it is cooked .
What if the vagina was to represent like birth to new things? Like a new turn on podcasts? Just a suggestion
Shane - Hi Uno..  4:24
Don’t worry Shane you came back at the perfect time. Dislikes being gone means I can’t see negativity. That’s fine though I’m sure your a great guy.
I had a really rough day today, and this video cheered me up lots!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ We just love that you post Shane!! Can’t wait for Conspiracy videos those videos are always amazing.  Morgan should get her ordaining license you can get them online then she can be your officiant. Do a small wedding then have a bigger party. You guys, your parents, siblings, a few friends go to Cabo, Fiji, Hawaii wherever get married and have Morgen be the officiant. It doesn’t take much to get your license. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💍💍💍💍💍💍💍
that was hilarious, I was screaming all the way to the end. Lets just hope you don't get sued over this video, cause we need more amazing content like this. yikes.
Ahhhhhhh!!!! The queen is back 👑 😁
Shane so fucking funny gonna say just Google “why Chuck E. Cheese pizza so FUCKED UPP??? 😂😂😂💀💀
he should’ve talked more about the almost law suit I was waiting for the whole tea
The beginning of this video reminded me of addiction, I don’t know if u know much about it, it controls your brain and thoughts that the normal person wouldn’t have, it’s not just drugs and booze it can be food, sex, gym, work anything but it’s a part of our brain that makes us make bad choices, look into it, it’s crazy literally xxxx
I’ll admit I never really was a fan but watching this I’m a fan now changed a lot he’s really funny 😆
Love all your videos no matter what you post! It was nice to just sit back and watch a more relaxed funny video 😊
Pushin 🅿️
EVERYONE IS SO FUCKING SENSITIVE. I MISSED YOU SO MUCH SHANE! WELCOME BACK!!!!
I agree with the not seeing 2022, I had a lot of dark moments and it actually made me cry when you said "we made it" ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
they should order a pizza asking for it not to be sliced
So glad to see you back!!
nunca me decepcionas, Shane, little hi from mexico
Did he say $80 for 3 pizzas??? 😱😱😱
a podcast would be SO a cool i would listen to every single one ! xoxo <3
Eh. You're trying way too hard to win over the audience you once had. We aren't going to forget the weird/cringe things you've done, no matter how long it's been or how much time has passed. You're entertaining to watch but you aren't cool or funny like you used to be. Just being honest.
Absolutely happy to see you back 🐯💅
I just love that your BAAAAAAACK!!!!!! I Just  want to see more of your videos, any contents would do.... :) Love you<3
I've been waiting for this! Ugh, can you make more these please🥺. Love u both and also Chris his fam now❤️
Ive always been the type of person where I understand that things that happen in the past stay in the past, as long as those people learn to grow. Ive seen people do/say dumb shit, apologise, but go right back to doing and saying dumb shit but you can tell that Shane is a completely different person and its a completely different time to what it use to be and its so good to see how far shane has come and how much he has grown ❤️❤️❤️
Love it... so glad you're back😍
I'm republican...
Okay hear me out. You can order single slices while you're there. So I think they are using the other slices to make a whole pizza. Not from the customers, just from the partly used pizzas from the back.
43:20 I jumped through whole video and I'm glad I haven't watched. Not the vlog with clickbait title. Again shouldn't come back before Jenna Marbles.
I love waking up to a Shane video 😩👌✨ needed
Pushing 🅿️
Loved this so much cant wait for docu series, conspiracies and food videos :) ♥️
shane, do a small ceremony with only immediate family and close friends. then, if you want, do a reception with other guests. you can have it both ways
I honestly just love that you're back and loved the start with your brother! I'm intrigued! Missed you 💜
This is exactly what i want <3 Thank you so much
We did make it sis!
Dont tell me that you are returning to YouTube cuz you are going to cancel Jeffreee Star's Skincare launch.....
I can’t stop looking at that extra large slice of pizza… I wanna eat it. Gimme it
So excited to see you are back!🖤
Good nice video friends
Best thing that has happened all year is u coming back queen love you always !
Love you Shane!!!!
Name a happier day than when Shane posts a video of ANY kind after his moment of silence ❤️‍🔥
What 80$ on three pizzas omg that's expensive!! Lol
Waiting for Chuck E to comment on this video for a collab 👁👄👁
To funny!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Thnx for making me feel good !
HI SHANE!!!! MISSED YOU SO MUCHHHH.
I was so happy to wake up this morning and see this!! I have missed you and your laughter ( or "honking" as ryland calls it).  This made my day!!! Hope you never leave you tube again!!! Love you!!!
hay
thank you i needed you in my life ❤️❤️
I'm so glad your back!! I love your personality.
Im so so happy you are back! I missed you so much. And PLEASE do a Podcast again!!! I loved Shane and Friends, it was so much fun!
I hope you never stop doing YouTube
I’ve missed these kinds of videos from you ❤️❤️❤️
You are so funny
loved the video and love you🥺 glad to see you back
you have NO idea how nice it is to see you again!!! make whatever content you’re passionate about, we just love and miss you!! 🥰
who let this man come back
I love how you all bounce off each other it’s hysterical 😂❤️
Dude I’m not joking, I was stalking your theory videos and I only got to watch one, is was the one talking about this stuff !!?!?
Shane, I’m so happy to have you back! This video is so great. I’ve really missed cry-laughing at the things you say. Very excited for the podcast!! 💖
All I hear is SNORTING ..KINDA ANNOYING NOW
I love you
It was posted 12 hours ago and it has 1million views already. So happy for you, Shane!
As a former CEC employee I'm haunted by the haphazard way 20 something y.o. kitchen staff would murder the pizza with the seesaw cutter. Wasted a lot of good ass chunks. Still have nightmares 🤣
Shane may have done some questionable things but his content is too good…
this video made me so happy. love you shane ❤️
please post your podcasts i would love to watch
I’m so glad you’re back Shane MISS YOU can’t wait for your next video<3333333333333333333 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just keeping it real 🅿️ aside of all the hate he gets constantly. Every time Shane uploads a new video it hits top 3
Not all of us are Karen’s still love and want your videos 🥰
What was this even about Shane?
I'll watch anything Shane posts.
I cannot wait to watch this, in bed right now with leftover pizza. Best way to start my day! 🥰🥰
Welcome back shane !!
#3 on trending! Let's fcking go! 🤟
Missed him so much. May be the biggest supporter ever of a podcast or just about anything else he can come up with. Been with him since I was 12 years old. Always been there. Keep up the amazing work! Missed seeing videos like this. Just fun. ❤️
So we're all past the fact that this dude is creepy towards children and toxic?
🐱
Have you addressed the sex jokes/comments from when you were cancelled ? I’m an RN, advocate for women etc and had been a fan of yours for 3 years.  I thought this video had answers… but instead it’s clickbait and nothing too serious. The comments about women made me feel uncomfortable.
Welcome back shane !
Yes!!! Please start a podcast!! 🙏🏼💚
Iron man 🔥
i want to love and support shane but i feel as if he views his ‘cancellation’ as something that negatively impacted him as a victim, rather than people holding him accountable for building his career on racism. it very much feels like he still holds the opinion of, ‘people were mean to me for dumb jokes and i didn’t deserve the hate’ and he hasn’t actually learned and isn’t truly sorry, he’s sorry he got caught. like the fact he made a dumb joke about his mexican teddy, it’s not outwardly bad but like you’re treading on thin ice why would u make a joke about that.
Ok but I really hope you make that Little Debbie ice cream review 😂
so glad you're back shane! you're helping me a lot during these times. love you ❤️
I LOVE RYLAND 💘  SO MUCH!!!!!
I'm so happy you are bac
Never been so disappointed with a clickbait
I'm gunna call you Chris....mas...LMAOOOOOOO
I really want Shane to come back to his conspiracy videos, they were my favourite!
In Australia it’s O O O O’Brian 😂
You all make my heart so damn happy. Vag or no vag.  Question to ponder.....would ChuckE have a RATchet vag? #BeautifulRatchetVag #NewMerch 🤣🤣🤣😵
I love you so much! and Im so happy to see you happy!!!!!!
I enjoy your videos even earlier old ones there entertainment!
LOVE this! Thanks Shane for making a new video. Made my night.
Hahaha, my family is the Chucky Cheese Pizza that is scraped off the floor  for sure.
I missed your content so much and I’m so glad you’re back!!! Because you’re videos and ice cream were the only thing getting through school. Welcome back ❤️!!
Don’t care what the hell you’re posting…., I just love YOU!!! ✨😊
SO GOOD TO SEE U BACK
Yaaaaay, Shane! You did it! Not only did you make a come back, but you came back stronger, sassyier, more confident, and just handled it like the pro you are. Sooo thankful you are back. Love from a fellow Coloradan🥰
I love how people still sulking about Shane. Why are people in any form of spotlight not entitled to be people? Why are they personally responsible for how people who choose to view them feel? Get over it, just enjoy the video and stfu about sht no one cares about anymore
Or they know you guys and make this time a vip fresh pizza 😆
Crying over the pizza ordering 😂 Ryland was not impressed 🤣
lol your inner voice is the player. so the people that don't have an inner voice are just npc
Am I the only one who thinks hes mean to Rylan? Otherr than that it was a good video and had me laughing
Shane this made me so happy Thankyou so much I love you 🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️
This vid is like when I walk into TJ Maxx and pick up that cushion I didn’t know I needed, but now I couldn’t imagine life without it. Loved it 🥰
SHANE! Do “Cancelled” - the podcast interviewing those who’ve been canceled by society. That shit would be fire 🔥
Shane regardless of the content I am so happy for you ❤️ do you, you are an amazing soul ❤️ you should be so proud of yourself
Podcast called “The Cancelled”
I love that Shane is back!!
Internet reality television 🍿
Love you Shane, I get so happy when you and your family post because I know you are a blast and I missed you so much. Can't wait for the podcast, YES PLEASE!!!
Without a doubt the funniest video to date! I laughed the majority of the time 😂😂😂🇮🇪
"im not a doctor" ✋ BROKE ME 🤣
Love the podcast idea! Go for it! And I'd love to see more conspiracy videos! But what the actual fuck! You have to listen to a long advertisement before you order the fucking pizza? That's fucked up!
I think A LOT of people are secretly republicans. 😆 Let's Go Brand0n
Chucky cheese has frozen pizza now.
👑🙃💚
And the only time I have been at Chucky Cheese , I ordered salad.
I missed you my friend. I hope you continue to upload.
Ahhhhh! 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Sad to think because some people hated on Shane that he thought he was cancelled - like … we have been waiting for you. You can’t get cancelled when you still have a following like us.
Shane Dawson trying to tip-toe around the fact that Chuck-E-Cheese didn't do anything to try and fix the situation even 2 years later.
Shane Dawson ❤️ my first fav YouTuber
Dang you guys get harsh with your humor. That can damage your relationship even though it's a joke.
You're a legend mate, ❤ from Australia
I bet million dollars that Shane never touched that pizza😂🙌👏🙏
Pleaseeeeeee do more creepy conspiracies 😫😫😫I was JUST watching the oldies yesterday and it’s not the same of how many times I’ve watched them. We need moreee, we need to shit our pants shaneee
Jail
Can't stop laughing!!! I miss you Shane ❤ Keep the videos coming 🥰
$80 on some fuckin pizza 🤬😭🤢🤢
Welcome back Shayne!!! Missed you a lot. Looking forward to more uploads soon 🤍
A new shane video? My day has been blessed
I am obsessed with the long videos!! I love u Shane! You are thriving and looking GOOOOOOOD might I add!!!! Work babyyyyyyyy
I love it
So funny. Made me smile for 43 mins while at work. grateful for my job and the fact I can listen to YouTube, grateful for YouTube and how Shane is back xox
You and jefree need to do a podcast it will be iconic!!!
I dont even care what shane posts - i just love him in anything and everything, he is so entertaining. My all time fav is conspiracy though but again, over the moon with ANYTHING!!
You crazy 😜
God I’ve missed this!!! I laughed out loud multiple times during this which I needed! 💕💕
Yeees love this please MORE
Shane coming back is everything!! And yes the podcast would be awesome with all the other cancelled celebs 😂💀
The thing about Chuck E. Cheese pizza is how could it possibly look like that? I don’t get itttt. Even if the shape is wonky and they cut it uneven, the crust should still line up should it not? 🤷🏽‍♀️🤔
shane is like the friend u have in class that u cannot stop laughing with
We love you Shane ❣️ love from Nanny Star blue mountains Australia 🦘 happy chuky
Whether you like shane or not, his sense of humour is 1 of a kind! I was pissing myself this whole video
Dude literally you can only follow this if you have ADHD. I am home. thank you.
Yay so glad your back!!!!!
His inability to finish a sentence is going a little to far...a little overly quirky here. But in regards to ChuckE: Lots of people have come out and said, that they tried to ask for the pizza not to be cut, but the store refused every time. This just proves the theory even more. Their explantation also doesnt work for the pepperonies not lining up.
Missed you, happy your making vids again ❤️
Shane is back baby
i love this video!! you’re my comfort youtuber and i have been waiting for a new video to watch on repeat. can’t wait for the conspiracy videos ❤️❤️
Laughed so hard.. loveeee that shane is back.
LOVE
"before you know...you dont know" im getting this tattoed
SHAAAAAAAAAANE🥰🥰🥰
Oh. So you're definitely selling the house? Ok then.. 🥺
You should sue them 🥴
Omg i missed all the laughs and smiles and SHANE!! WELCOME BACK!! LOVE YOU XO
Ngl i don’t know how to feel abt this guy but I will admit this video was entertaining
Love u Shane🥰 im just happy your back.
I read the psychic's name as "Maxi Friend" and I'm js that's a great title for pads
...Bipedal
I'd love to see a video of Chuck E. Cheese making a pizza and it turning out the same.
How are ALL of the comments so positive?
SHANE please come back weekly I missed you so much.... you make me giggle
Could of sworn I unsubscribe from you a long time ago
It’s time to retire the fake forced snort Shane lol
As someone who lives in Colorado, I can say for sure I've never heard anyone say "howdy" in any way other than a joke or impression of someone from... somewhere else.  Having a truck can be nice though, especially when we're in the season we are now where it was 60 yesterday and today we have a winter storm advisory. And then it'll get up to being hot enough to melt the snow and it'll become a gross, slushy mess and then repeat numerous times until spring proper comes around. Then it does that again between fall and winter too but with more hot than cold. Our family gave them the name the "Early/Late Bi-polar Season" as if Colorado had some kind of brain controlling the weather.   That name actually came about with a family member with a bi-polar disorder of some kind (like a lot of mental things there's a rather wide and really hard to accurately use a lotta the time and I don't think she ever told me specifically what it is) said, "Oh hey, just like me!" when discussing the flip-floppy nature of Colorado's weather. I'm not sure if that also happens in the mountains but in the 3/4ths that is flat that's usually how it be.
No matter what Shane Dawson you talking about kids will never be okay you sick freak
Love this and love you so much Shane ❤️
I was literally laughing the whole god damn video 😂😂😂😭☠️☠️☠️
Dude takes 10mins to get to the point😐
Rats are cute and they love pizza.
LMAO
Those slices shift when the pizza is cut, right?
Shane, honestly - don’t explain yourself. You are a gorgeous man having MILLIONS of subscribers on YT. Remind yourself that you are a bad b*tch! If you upload a video, YOU UPLOAD A VIDEO. Period(!) Keep going, kisses
This was nice 😊❤️
The "cancelled anonymous" did it for me. I was laughing so hard
Shane! This is EXACTLY what we want! Just you, being silly, funny, happy! We've waited years ❤️ so so happy right now. I feel right back in 2018!!!! More like this!! Xx

welcome back Shane, we missed you a lot :) <3
Red dwarf had this theory back in the 80’s with their ” red dwarf” simulation game ;)
Thanks SD I love you
Love it Shane! Make more like this 😍😍
I laughed and laughed all the way through this video. Great to see you back
“ we never got past the guest list because all of our guests left us “ 😭😂
I love how chaotic your videos are. They make me feel less crazy 😂❤️
so happy to see you making content again 🧡
I'm just mad you chose classic over stuffed crust!🙄
I’ve been binge watching all the conspiracy videos the last few days 🥲🥲🥲 and now I get a notification there’s a new video giving a hint to new conspiracy videos?! yessssss
It's been so long needed the laughs ❤😂
Why does Ryland still act like a desperate gold digger? Is that his thing?
I'd watch daily uploads
wait....80 bucks for 3 pizzas? what in the actually fuck?
Watched this tonight and now me and the hubby are watch the conspiracy video xD I got him hooooked xD ❤️🐷
Ryland you think 3 years is a long time without getting married, I’ve been waiting 6 but it’s finally happening this year!!
What happened to the bedazzled fridge?! 😂
keep it up, shane! you still have supporters!
Yay, Shane is back! 😊 I needed some laughs 😂
Yes we want to buy your house
I fucking loved it - this is the Shane i love - you have me crying with laughter every single time!! So glad your back!
I’m gonna need a little debbies milkshake vid rn featuring their new ice cream
Yeah bring back Shane and Friends again that’s a great idea💀
Love the video. Just glad you feel better enough to come back.
You guys crack me up. Missed you guys 😊😀
😂😂😂😂 the whole beginning of this video… 😂😂😂 Jaime lynn
Oh I missed you 😂😂😂
YAYYYYY IVE MISSED SHANE VLOGS LIKE THIS SO FUCKING MUCHHHHHHH
I'm so happy
Shane you're a bear 😘
You don’t understand how happy this made me!! You’re back ❤️🌈
Yasss. Bisexual queens 💖💜💙
Thanks for the laughs.  I'm just 3 movies away from watching all the Marvel movies.  Then what?
🤣🤣🤣
why my discount code for ur merch no work😢 <3 <3 <3
I’ve just started watching it and OMG IM SO EXCITED
When Ryland is like what kind of gay do I classify as omg henny 🤣
wait shane u r skinny
Wait, what happened to their old videographer? I forgot his name
The disclaimer edits 😂
I got married in Las Vegas and it was wonderful. You can just purchase a package and don't really need to plan everything because they do it all. It was perfect. You can have as many guests as you want join you on your special day.
I love u 💕💕🥰💕💕
👑
I think they make the pizzas and pre cut them and then put them together
On the next episode of Shane after once again going after the Chuck E Cheese pizza again: Shane our prison adventure!
I'm so glad you're back
Peridot can’t wait to have your humour and laughter to be in my life
That was so funny.  Thanks for making the best videos. You and Ryland are seriously the funniest, most entertaining couple on YouTube.  Bravo! 💐
🤣🤣🤣 dark but dead true we made it 2022 🤣🤣🤣🤣✌️✌️
Saw this before I went to sleep and it’s the first thing I’m watching this morning nothing gets me more excited than seeing Shane ❤️
The beginning reminded me of the Lisa Schwartz era
Up at 3am watching this
Shane you were so mean to Ryan.did you ever consider Ryans feelings? Ryan deserves better.
$80!!! For 3 pizzas??!?!?  Can’t wait to see more videos ❤️❤️
Cancelled or not, i still miss shane amd his videos❤❤❤
Let's hope he has changed and has reflected. Everyone deserves a second chance. I enjoyed the video and laughed out loud. I missed that.  I'm looking forward to what comes next.
🤣🤣🤣 I fucking love you.
Shane why not order a pizza half and half uncut
Where were u shane we missed u sooo much
Dawlsons! check out our new ep! https://youtu.be/tmdr1ec2Z_w
Love
Just dont get law suit 😂
This is what I've needed. I've laughed my ass off. I'm so glad to see Shane in such a good place
And shane u did so well now u made me wanna order ChuckEE Cheese dw I'll consult my doctor before that
Bruh… Ryland talking about the chamberlain coffee and his pussy IM DIEING YALL
Can't believe i watched a 44mins video of Shane but i did.....n i laughed so hard It was the first thing i did after waking up and it gave me the 🅿️
Yes finally a conspiracy
WOW the Internet is so quick to forgive it's amazing
I love that all their comedy is so random!  Missed you Shane Dawson you popped up and I had to click
Dying laughing over the Pooh joke. I LOVE YOU GUYS!
Yass your back ❤️❤️❤️
Bye SHISTERRR
OMG you are soooo funny Shane :) :)
I just wanna point out that domino's rolls they're dough in store and it's still round
So nice to have you back!! Can’t wait to see what you start creating!! I loved your interview series, you met some amazing people, and learnt so much cool new people! 2022 is yours!! 👏🏻👍🏻😬
Omgggg Shaneeeeee, you were there for me through my darkest times in my life, and to finally have you back makes me so happy🥺🥺. I cant wait to see more videos xx
i missed this, i was laughing the whole time. missed you shane
I am really shocked they haven't been wedding planning this entire time and I'm also really not shocked....
🥰 .. aww, don't worry about 'that' dream. It was probably more representative of your new life in Colorado.. birth, new life, change, feeling re-energised etc.,  maybe even your subconscious telling you to pursue the idea of starting a podcast 🙌💪💞
Been engaged for 5 years, ain't no thing. Its a representation of our commitment, we 100% intend to marry each other but have more important things to spend money on just now.
No matter what I still love Shane
I missed you
im so glad your back on youtube ! welcome back ❤
IM SO HAPPY !!!!
We didn't forget.
I love Shane but what was this?? Never thought I would downvote one of his videos but here we are…
I hate that good people are getting canceled. Good to have u back Shane!🥰
Who told this man to get on the internet like we wouldn’t forget 😐
Glad to see you're doing better, and having fun playing around.  I love you guys, and love your videos too. Keep them coming
This is exactly what we wanted!!!! I laughed for literally 40 minutes straight. We missed you and are so happy you’re back ❤️❤️❤️ we love you
Cried laughing multiple times
Keep the content coming 🥺💗
I'll take anything ! I'm glad your back! I mean I still get the fix through Ryland and morgan but ahhhhh its amazing love you always have always will! ❤
YES 💗
LOVE
QUEEN IS TRENDING 😍
I liked the food videos but it's the waffle maker and microwave ones I miss, you need a place in the barn for these.
You made my day Shane! You are hilarious, you put me in laughing fits 🤣 I’ve been rewatching a lot of your videos and watching Rylands Vlogs. So happy you’re filming again and glad that you’re prioritising your happiness.
Soo P! 😂 Loved it!
We really missed all of you and also excited to see more videos 😘😘😘😘love you
Its probably because they sell pizza by the slice as an option
I just laughed so much and I love that 🥲
I am deceased. I’d watch you do anything <3
So happy you’re back ❤️❤️
You're BI-pedal, 🤣
Honestly i dont even care what ur vids are about, i am so happy you do yt again and no matter what ill watch it 100 times😫💕
chuckee cheese is not pushing 🅿️
I MISSED YOU SM YOUR VIDEOS BROUGHT ME SM JOY😭
So happy to see Shane's face😭😭😭😭
Please do a podcast omg 😱
I feel like my “player” left his controller at the table and went outside 😬
💛💛💛
Shane made #3 on trending, just goes to show how much love everyone still has for him. ❤️
Shane’s videos got me through so many depression episodes. Seeing this made me so happy. It’s just like the old days. I laughed so much.
hi all people reading the comment😍😘
Yes Shane please go to Disneyland 👏😁
YASSSSS
Vagina dreams, wonky rat pizza & fancy dress conspiracy outfit choices. What’s not to love about this, made my week! 🖤🖤🖤
The podcast could be called «Canceled» where you only interview cancelled celebs😂
Damn, I needed this. Was laughing the whole time. Missed you Shane, keep them coming.   Much love!
Someone get me up to speed because I haven’t really watch Shan Dawson for four years so is he getting a lawsuit or Someone has a lawsuit on him I’m confused
Shane you are literally my all time favorite YouTuber, I can honestly look back at the past 10yrs of my life and say there has yet to be a YouTuber to captivate me the way your content powerfully does. No other YouTuber whose videos can change my mood from a really bad day to.. this is okay with a smile. Thanks for being you Shane and never giving up on your audience/fans!
He probably thought his comeback was gonna break the internet but seems like he fell off
I LAUGHED SOOOOOOO MUCHHHH throughout this entire video! And in those instances did I remember how much I missed your vids 😂
Very happy your back 😊 hope there is a lot more videos on the way
Woohooo Shane!! We’ve missed you. We watch Rylands videos to see you in. You’re so funny. Awaiting the podcast eagerly
All "P" 😂😂😂😂 Chuck E. does have some bomb pizza! 🤷‍♀️😂
The Pepperoni on the Pepperoni pizza match up  🤔 the half and half tho 😒
It’s the 🅿️ for me
Welcome back! I've been having a tough week and this made it brighter!

Idk his video’s seem lower quality. Just plan what you want to say.
I'm watching this on the DL
I told myself I would dislike the video IF and ONLY IF there was a self-deprecating fat joke... took less than 1 minute...
yes
I see sadness in Ryland’s eyes everytime “marriage” is mention.
Welcome back Shane 😊🤗💕
ur finnier noawadasy
I have bad stretch marks too. I have been and still am to a lesser extent fat, and shat out 3 babies that I love 🤷‍♀️

Ryland watching movies is me 😂 except when it comes to marvel 😅
I was laughing so freaking much. I can't wait for the next video!
$80 for three "large" garbage pizzas? Lmfao ya'll must have some wild tax write offs.
And all is good in the world... Shane is back!❤
Before my girlfriend passed away, we would listen to your podcasts on long drives. It’ll be nice to listen to them again, she would’ve loved that you’re doing that
$80 for three large pizzas?!?!? Sue them
Missed you so much Shane!
So happy you’re making more videos again!!🖤🖤
Welcome back Shane... 😭😭💕
Shane having a dream about Ryan having a vagina
This video is hilarious! I enjoyed it so much 😂…and omg Shane I’d love to be in your movies 🍿  🎥 😉😂😂 I can play a scary tree! 💀😭lol
We miss you 😘
Spirit guides are demons masquerading as angels of light. Be careful, only Jesus can protect you from them.
Damn.. Shane is SO back..made my well first smile in 5 months.
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Just another person who really really missed this. Shane, you are reaching people just by being you and doing this video. It was my first smile of the day, thanks for the little escape. Keep going
So as a content creator ryland is ok and his opinions miss more then hit but the best part is seeing how big of a fan he is to Shane when Shane is entertainer mode. Just marry him Shane have a small big gay wedding somewhere tropical so you can wear a big white tropical outfit with your nasty chest hair popping out and embrace it lol
Let's get this bread
I woke up the household by laughing so loudly when Shane said he dreamt about Ryland having a vagina.🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm looking forward to your podcast. ❤️🏳️‍🌈
I’ve lived in Colorado my whole life, and watched you for years, since you started on YouTube, and when I learned you live in Colorado, I’m waiting for the day I randomly bunk into you!
Literally so excited for new conspiracy theory videos and or podcasts about all things mysterious, creepy, etc,. I’ve been here since Shanaynay and friends and sometimes I miss that but either way watching Shane in general makes me feel so nostalgic and he’s so funny and genuine 🥰
Shaneeeeeeeee glad you are posting again.  Greetings from Amabelle en Monica Belgium
This made my day! Thank you! 💕🙏
You’re my favorite YouTube since ever literally for decades
I missed Shane videos so much, so glad their back
Shane Dawson is back. Life is good
I can't picture Shane with a woman
Is this channel still demonitized?
Such an interesting video.. Welcome back Shane!
Positive vibes 🦋
I’m in my kitchen making myself a grilled cheese sandwich at midnight depressed beyond belief, and now I’m SMILING and LAUGHING. THANK YOU.❤️
I LOVE SHAME YOURE SOO FUNNY
Loooooove videos like this🥰🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I am living for this 😊😊😊 I was shook when I saw this to be honest
So happy to have you back. Full support every time. I have been following you over a decade and love every single minute
This video was 🅿️

Random: We in a simulation  Me : how ? What’s your source Random : trust me bro   😂
This is exactly what I wanted!
Thanks for the laughs Shane love the anyone wanna buy my trauma house 🤣🏠 🤣
The best part is that YouTube disabled the dislike button. 😎
Such a good video!!
Loved it. Loved it. Loved it. I want more 💯✌❤🇦🇺😁
How can you use the word fact when you haven't proven shit? Are all organisms also controlled by an alien?
Before I start just want to let you know I love you ! 😁😁😁😁😁😁
I guess no one can ever be canceled
This video made me so happy!!!
PLEASE THE IRON MAN OUTRO😂😂😂
Yes to the podcast omg omg omg can’t wait Shane! We love you
I am genuinely happy that you posted a video Shane !! You are literally my favorite YouTuber and to see you be a lot more happier and be the person who you want to be fills my heart with joy. Keep showing off the growth you have been developing after all the hardships you are still out here making videos for your fans so thank you Shane. I love you and hopefully many more videos to come !

It's so cute when Ryland gets jealous 😁😁😊
I love this video so fucking much. So happy to have u back

So happy to see you in my notifications again!!😁❤ Lol even tho I love seeing u in Ryland's vids,  I'm glad u were comfortable enough to post your own vid 😅🥰🥰 hope to see more cus tbh I'll watch anything from u lol love u guys ❤️❤️❤️🙏🏼🤞🏼
A lot of drama is going to happen with video fuck it let's go we miss you shane
Ryland giving off Kris Jenner “You’re doing great sweetie!” vibes
Maybe Chuck E. Cheese’s cuts the pizza before they cook it or something
I’m so excited - it’s 40min long - appreciate your work Shane ! Thank god you are back - YouTube was so boring without you …☺️
I loathe the fact that the people here turn a blind eye to the fact that Shane is the same man who was sexually exploiting children and animals, not to mention his blatant racism.
I missed you Shane! Welcome back, I can't wait to watch anything you make 🥰🥰🥰
Im soooo glad your back finally ive missed your content
this is exactly what we wanted!!!!
i love how shane is so open talking about rylands imaginary vagina that he dreams about but not about A LAW SUIT WITH CHUCK E MF CHEESE 😀
Shane is back!!!!! I’ve missed you!!! 💜 lots of love all the way from New Zealand!! Can I have your Gucci slides if your throwing them 🤞🏼😂😂😉
umm i’ve worked at a pizza place and the thing he said about the cutting the pizza and that’s why they look messed up is not true no matter how you cut it, it should still add up to a circle🤨
*Camera dude is annoying with he's snorting and laughing at unfunny things, this video was painful*
You seem genuinely happy in this video, I loved it, Thanks Shane! "Before you know, you don't know..."😆😆
Ryland is so sweet to Shane!! I hope to find a Ryland one day❤️
Shane pls learn how to produce!!! Ur videos will be much better and doesn’t feel like a half a** vlog 😅 we don’t want this we want well produced and thought out videos with a continuous flow. I would love for you to follow ur dreams with filmmaking but you gotta perfect YouTube before hitting the big screens
Omg can I just say that SHANE YOU REALLY LOOK AMAZING 💕💕
Where is Cheeto at?  Love him too
Haven't smiled that much in a while. Missed you Shane
Ryland was funnier than usual In this lol😅
PUSHING P
I MISSED YOU SHANE!!!
Shane or Ryland?? Who’s vlog depicts their true Relationship the best?  My vote is Shane’s
100% on simulation theory! 👏👏
not gonna lie i was giggling throughout this entire video
I havnt watched yet but is it chuckycheese? It all went down hill after the theory of them reusing the pizza lol its like chuck cheese was secretly behind the failed canceling attempt of Shane in 2020 🤣
You know I really don’t know how to feel about Shane right now I don’t know if he’s a good guy or a bad guy
We've missed you Shane, welcome back!❤️❤️
Ryland with a 🐈! Bahahaha 🤭🤣
Keep on posting videos please. We are all here!
Shane you look amazing!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Omg is 2:45am I woke up saw this and I'm cracking tf up.... I really missed your vids 🧡🤣🧡
how did everyone juss forget abt that
Aweeee I missed their randomness!!!!
So happy you’re back!!! Love you❤️
32:05 I'm screaming and laughing so loud, my neighbor came and knocked on my door asking if I'm okay🙈🙈🙈🙈😂😂😂😂
Happy Shane makes my day! Missed you sweet Shane ❤
Omg shane if u don't want that pink windbreaker Ryland chose pls i want it. Omg but like shipping is too much to get it to the Netherlands
It's great to see you back!
I’m sure there will be a handful of people who think this video is controversial and will came at you for it, but personally I love it this is such a genuine video that shows how happy you are and I’m here for it ❤️ I wish you the best with all to come in your life you deserve it !!
Not Ryland casually having a stroke at the end 😂
Omgg I love how you talk about something then one minute you change to talking about something els this is literally me i can’t finshe  a sentence 😂😂
I’ve been really in my feelings lately and you posting this video just made me feel really really happy. Thank you this video is exactly what I needed. I haven’t laughed this much or this hard in a long time. I really appreciate you Shane
Do a fucking video with emma.
I have a lazy eye toooo
"Chris...mass" fucking killed I off
This was hilarious
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!!!
I feel like I can speak for most of us, we want vlogs not podcasts.
The whole vagina story was funny but I know that a lot of gay partners fear that their s.o. leaves them for the opposite sex (if they are bi). Just saying, be understanding guys😅
I want my 22nd birthday at chuck e cheese.
HES BACK! OUR QUEEN IS BACK! 😁
So happy you’re back! And excited for all the content to come! I want the podcast and the food videos. Give it all to me daddy bear!
i enjoyed this and can't wait for more 😁
omg stop I love that they all dressed up to go to chuck e. cheese 😭😭😭
The conversation about making your throat tight made me realize men don’t really understand vaginas. Cause technically a Kegel is us “tightening our vaginas” and It’s really interesting to me
Not me already shaking my head agreeing and saying same when Shane says “If you’re watching this video, YOU GET IT” 😂😂
Omg you guys have me laughing so hard
Could Chuck-E-Cheese be like that because they sell a lot of half & half pizzas but the way they make them is by making a full pizza and then cutting it in half (giving customers one half) so they end up with a lot of half pizzas and that's where they get all those odd pieces to put together, not people's leftovers. Does that make sense?
ok but honestly where is their response XD
I’m happy shane is back but how come nobody is talking about how the pizzas literally didn’t match 😳👀
you back!
im so happyyy ur back <3 love
I love how there is an urgent cared placed in the same parking lot right behind Shane Dawson!!! U guys missed that hahahaahaha
i love this HAHAHAHA "ik this is probably not what you want"... SHANE U LOOK HAPPY AND YOU'RE HAVING FUN I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS
only like 3:50 mins in and i missed this lowkey 😭
this is my comfort chanel. I love you so much Shane
We love a good Chuck E. Cheese parody
we missed you shane!!!! lol you seem like you are in a good place, better than the last time we saw you! your spirits have been lifted lol  keep your chin up and keep making this funny ass content ... please! 🙏🏼 lol sending love 💖
i thought i was seeing things when i got this notif while at work, welcome back again :)
WELCOME BACK SHANEEEE
Haven't laughed out loud at a video in a while. I was sad when it finished. So happy to have you back!
Chuckie cheese better come for me because there is no way that is the same pizza. Went to 4 stores here and got pizza and not one of them looked like that.
All the shaking and constant jarring of the camera just made me grab my anti nausea medicine
I’ve been watching your videos for years and it’s so great to see this new chapter unfold! So happy for you guys and I can’t wait to listen to the podcast
Thank goodness...the world finally seems normal again xxx
Oh my God just please keep making videos like this… Totally off-the-wall, totally unexpected, just goofy and fun 🤩
10:00 😭😭😭 I’m loosing it
Order uncut pizza 🥰
I loved seeing you in Rylands vids lately, so glad you’re back! 🤩
This was really funny,it reminded me of the good old videos when Shane would hangout with his friends and make jokes
I miss your old food videos so much!! I go back and rewatch them all the time! They bring me so much joy. That’s how I fell in love with you and your channel 💕 so glad to see you again
The Emma comments are sending me. This video is hilarious. I'm not even halfway through but I've been laughing the whole time.
Yeah Adventure to Vancouver Canada babe
❤️❤️❤️
Thanks for making my day though I'm late to the party but love your videos can't wait for more
Missed you sm. ❤
Shane we want you, we don't care what you do
Shoot I miss the food review vids too
I missed you so much T-T
Omg Shane stop making us wait for new videos! 💀I hope ur videos remain on youtube foreverrrr
I love Shane but sometimes I wish he stayed on track when he talks about things. Lmao
This was hilarious lol. Shane making peace with one of his biggest conspiracy’s.
Omg is that JARED
👍🏻
You don't have to have a suit wedding! Me and my man just gathered some of our closest friends, no family, and got married at the court house. Then hosted 2 parties the following year <3 nothing big, like one with 40 people and one with 20, just cosy! + also had a photoshoot for wedding photos separate from any the dates. SO, marrying at the courthouse with just a few people were magically, just us!   Also, long comment, BUT SHANE, you seems so happy! Im proud <3
I hate you Shane, stay away from Youtube.
When you get in a scary lawsuit about a video and basically post a short version of the same video😭😂😂😂
Yall just made me want pizza 🍕  lol 🐷
so…
I love you Shane, I will forever and people only grow and become better. ❤️
too little too late, $$$ GRAB
Omg this is exactly what I want you being you !!! Laughing talking shit lol thank you! Can't wait for your next video !!!!! 😘😘😘😘
Yes Shane is back
Babyyyyyy eeee 🤣  I missed him so much
Easy watching enjoyable video! Happy you're back making content, in any creative way you do! Team Shane :-)
I LOVE HOW GAY THIS VID IS
So glad your back! I havent laughed this hard at a YT vid in so long. Sooo now i wanna go to chucky cheese in my hometown at see what happens 😈 interesting….
Omfg can’t wait for you to get back to conspiracies! I miss them so much!
So glad to see you back and so happy. 💕
Dont worry shane! I actually prefer random videos like this because theses kinda of videos are the funniest!
we really waited 3 months for this..
You’re back 😍
i’m literally gonna say tight pussy energy now. you have coined a new term. amazing.
The part where he thought his dream was real and that he should hit that, followed by oh no wait he doesn't, aww. Lmao.
The beginning of this video... Shanes attention span is like my 2 year olds. All over the place. 😂😂😂😂
wait omg!!!! TIGHT PUSSY ENERGY???? HOW HAS NOBODY THOUGHT OF THAT?!!!!!!
"you're dreamt you're with Brittney Spears but then you wake up and realize it's Jamie Lynne" lmao nightmare
I love how there’s an URGENT CARE in the back Lol 😂😂😂
TPE!!!!
I have been wanting to see a physic for a couple of weeks now and me and my coworker have been seeing signs to go see one and then you talk about your experience with one.
Shane looks so happy and refreshed & I’m glad to see it! ❤️
Out outro KILLED Me 🤣
so happy to see you posting again :)
Lol the way there is an urgent care center just across from chuck e cheese's
missed you shane ! but also i do miss the life hack videos lol brings back some good memories
It’s funny how sheeple switch up with the press of a button. I never stood behind the “cancel culture bs” but it annoys me to see people all of a sudden “I love this about Shane”, he is so funny now”, “I’m so glad he’s back”  6 months ago y’all were ready to torch his life over some sh*t that was entertaining back in the day. Sure it was insensitive, but back then nobody was as flaky as the snow on the ground… as they are today.  I’m glad the cucumber water drinking basic bi*t*es out there finally put the tea down to realize they are the problem. Two faced “fans” who just want to incinerate their “idols”. The people were always the joke, Shane just got sprayed by their lighter fluid
ANYTHING YOU POST I WANT SHANE PLEASE DONT THINK I DONT
Missed you Shane! Definitely excited for more from you
only youtuber who can make a 43 minute video feel like 15 minutes and have me cackling EVERY MINUTE 😭 this man is hilarious his humour elevates me
🤗🤗🤗🤍🤍🤍
It's so amazing to see you back making vidoes, Shane. We have missed you so much. Please keep making them!
Welcome back ❤️❤️❤️
Senior Poo
God i cant wait for the millions of expose videos that are gonna come out today
Chris: "You have tight pussy energy" I lost my shit. I have missed your videos Shane. I just love the chaotic energy from all of you.
I’ve been following along on rylands channel and I’m just glad to see your face even more! If I see any upload from you guys I literally watch it immediately no matter what I’m doing. I take you guys in the shower(that sounds creepy), driving in my car, cooking dinner. I’m sure I look like a lunatic laughing out loud by myself. I don’t care! Long story short I love you guys!!!!
Thank you so much for posting xxxxx
Glad U are back Shane
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
🅿️ushing 🅿️ 😭
900k likes in 9 hours, people are happy to see you again!
Well when a couple lives with each other for at least 6 months they can say they are common law married
I work in a pizza place we’re we make everything by hand like dough and sauce and such. A 16 inch just cheese pizza , hand tossed sauced and topped maybe takes 5 minutes give or take and an additional 10 minutes in the oven. Multiple pizzas can cause the cook time to go up but only by a few minutes. If we had a fully loaded oven and the oven is not at temp it can take an additional 10 to 15 minutes depending on what’s going in. If you don’t let it cool down right out of the oven, the cheese will cool between the pieces and make it look odd.  Also the pizza cutter they are using is most likely the one that’s the size of my arm. It’s just a huge blade with a handle that you rock back and forth to cut and if you can’t get a good pressure to evenly cut it can separate the pieces.
11:06 KRIS JENNER COULD NEVER
i thoroughly enjoyed watching this, welcome back ! <3
Yesss I miss your food videos love you guys
I had this big smile on my face the whole time. I’m so glad you are back
Omg please make food videos again
Literally audibly laughing the whole vid, so glad ur back
We missed and love you
The ongoing disclaimers popping up 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shane: Hiiiii Chrisy! hiii me: 😳👀😳
one of the funniest videos omg
Chucky: there's a sue again for me 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oh my goodness I been waiting for a video love you and Rylan so much keep up the good work guys 😄!!!
This is just a theory. Take it as you will. It’s not like Shane was the 1st one thinking about the pizza. Take all conspiracy theories with a grain of salt. Or don’t…up to you.
Welcome Back!
sending all the love to you shane!! good to have you back:)❤️
Wait but TPE merch like lettering across the front joggers and shirts I’m actually down for it
“Keeping it 🅿️, didn’t make sense” 🤣😂 I love you Shane
I've missed these videos so much. love Shane
Honestly what cancel culture did was more harm than good. I don’t exactly support Shane or the things he did. They were wrong, but now it’s on him to learn and grow from his mistakes. I wish you the best Shane.
Was so funny in the beginning when he was talking about jamie Lynn spears and I have the same name just spelt differently but I literally thought he was talking about me for a second but then I backed up and was like wow he said my name 2 times but was not about me
This notification is the Highlight of my 2022! Thank you 🙏 Missed you Shane!!!! Glad you're back 🥰
Really liked the video just having fun and messing around
i've been in quarantine for the past few days cus I have covid and I've been really fucking depressed. but as soon as I got this notification I cheered up. Thank you for this video shane, I really needed this. I'm glad to see you back on youtube!
this video was so hilarious i was dying the whole time!
cancelled
Shane rolling in, in his truck 🤣🤣 🤴 👑
❤️
Finally another video omg we’ve missed you !❤️
Pahaha I was just going to say..:P=Cancelled lol
Lol we made it 2022! You get it right lol??
SHANEEYYYYY WANEYYY!!!! i loved this video. i adore you. thank you for making videos, i really needed this today.
Uh 100% they did recycle pizza. A family member of mine was working at a Chuck E. Cheese during all the backlash. They had to keep it hush hush and tried to cover it all up with "new training". They definitely went back to recycling after the controversy calmed down. Yikes 😅
I loved every minute, cant wait to see more ❤️ ❤❤
The guy simulator talking is why we will become extinct 😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
42 seconds in and im like wth ???
I hate what the world did to you you've been my favorite youtuber since I joined
Wait it does say “Chuck E Cheese’s” ??? Has it always been that?
Shane Dawson you need to know…you are…handsome..brilliant…funny..YES YOU MADE IT XOXOXO
I 100 percent would watch yall go to Disney
Manifesting that Shane doesn’t get sued for this video lol. 😂 because this video comes together beautifully and deliciously unique. 😂
Shane’s sense of humor is so unique and only he can do what he does. I’m so happy to see him back. Hope he keeps uploading and making our days better. Love from a fellow creator <3
Shane on tight throat energy
Podcast but certain days are different podcasts stories. Interview someone on Monday podcast, ghost story experiences on Wednesday, and conspiracy on Friday. 😁❤️❤️❤️
Litreally anything from you is the best Shane
Can’t stop myself from skipping bits for the drama part
Please keep talking about suicide and suicidal ideation, people seem to skirt around it and as someone who struggles with those thoughts daily, it would mean the world to me
Glad your uploading again 💞 Yes, please do more conspiracy vids!!! Look into Missing 411 too!!!
The Kill Bill shirt 😍😍😍
The first 5 mins…………
I missed youuuuuu💗💗💗
Yesss!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽 we need a Shane in Disneyland vlog!
I think it’s safe to say anything you post we all like! Love watching your videos they always make my day better no matter what they’re about. Thank you for posting again please keep it up we miss you so much ❤️
Yesssssssss Shane this is you I loved it enjoyed watching every second much love and I hope you create more you are Iconic🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚+you are looking great and thinner keep on being happy because staying happy allows your mind to love yourself more and if your sad tell that feeling to fuck offfff it’s 2022 baby😘

Shane literally could do stand up comedy 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Oh my God I thought you'd never come back but holy shit Shane it doesn't matter what you post, it's clearly a passion project and it's yours and we love you!!
Ryland protecting Emma's career
Chucky cheese pictures don’t lie 🙇🏻‍♀️
i was laughing so much!! can’t wait for what’s next
The ending was perfect 👌
Wait did you drop in subscriber's?
I could listen to you all talk all day! Love you guys! I haven't laughed this much in so long.
"We dont have a guest list because all our guests left us "  MFs
Love you Shane! I look forward to watching your videos and Rylands every single week! Alpaca!  🦙
YAY unexpected Shane content!!!
Reality no mas.
Oh for the record Shane I'm here for anything and everything you post!!!!!
I would suggest making a podcast channel talking about your inner thoughts etc and have it private unless you feel like it would help others.   Obviously do what you love to talk about but maybe that could help with the pain you still hold on to.   Hope all is well shane! 💕
I MISSED YOU
SHANNEEEEEEEEE YOU ARE GLOWING
What if the pizza was from their buffet so that's why it's all fucked up
Ryland confidentiality saying 'I would have a good vagina' is a MOOD
Lol I love Ryland. I’m so happy to hear Chris ! Missed him on the last few podcasts
I bursted out laughing so many times.....it was awesome!!!!!
Shane lookin more and more like his dad everyday
crazy how filtered shane’s comments are. did y’all just forget what he did?
I think it's hilarious that they were threatened with a lawsuit but they still went out and got pizza for the video
even though the controversy I have been here or thinking about you Shane. your videos make me happy and Idk why. maybe it's your humor? but I'm so happy youre posting again and in Ryland's videos. cant wait for the conspiracy video and hopefully more to come. welcome back! <33  edit: IM SO DOWN FOR A PODCAST
I mean I would probably buy your house if I could afford it it's beautiful. But it's also in LA....
Shane, you better stop taunting Ryland. He loves you with all his heart. All from love. ❤ You guys had me cracking up on this video. You should go film the big wall of vaginas. 😆 🤣  Some are just nicer, tighter and better than others. Just like giving a bj... each woman is different, yet you men say you do it better... I always hold my own and beg to differ. 🧐🧐🧐😆😆😆 Too funny. But I wish you all the best on wherever life takes you and all your endeavors. PS. Can you make more videos of you and your brother on CT? I loved his analogy of human. Sending my love from Hawaii. Aloha...
Didn't have to click bait me man come on
Wait lawsuit? Oh Shiiiiiiiiiii..
i legit think i had a stroke at the end where ryland says he spent 80 dollars on that pizza. holy fucking shit
shane i just adore you
Should we return it 😂 best line 🍕
We really did make it though 🐷
I love this video. I love your energy! Thanks for entertainment
Missed you guys !!
I MISSED YOU!!!! 😭😭😭
Chuck E. Cheese should thank you for bringing in more business. Actually, that pepperoni pizza was looking really good.🍕 Welcome back!
I'm gonna start calling Shane The Skinny Legend.
I’m Literally obsessed with you

YYYYYEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
Okay, I say that if they aren't recycling pizzas, then they slice each slice individually, but that wouldn't make sense for the shorter longer slices
I really was happy to watch this!!! Always hilarious Shane
new year new me? but same old dirty jokes? lol! love it dont change for a f*****g person, screw the haters! get dem conspiracies out there!
Has anyone tried asking for a Chucky Cheese pizza that's uncut?
My colon hurts and Chuck E Cheese tried to push his penis in my painful a
Love you! Missed you! Glad you are back!
Shane we love you so much! My heart hurt hearing about your suicidal thoughts from the psychic. You seem to be doing great and I love seeing that. Don't ever take yourself away from us and your family especially. You've helped me so much with your content and I'll love you forever for that. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
T P E merch please!!
I don’t get it
So glad your back Shane! You’re so kind hearted and so happy you’re creating again!
I'm so mad YouTube didn't notify me you uploaded a new video!
My guy! A tight 😺 is the equivalent to a limp dick. Being tight is not the move
I'm so glad you're back!!
I will be looking forward to your podcasts
Glad ur back x
The disclaimers 🤣
I laughed alll the time. I love your video's Shane. I can not wait for the podcast!
This is so perfect!! Exactly what we needed, glad you took the time you needed to get here!
They gonna be catching Covid-19 with that pizza
"If you're watching this video, you get it."   PREACH
BAHAHAHA "im gunna call u christ-mas"
Glad you’re alive pahah
Nice job wasting food and buying food ur not gonna eat.
Did you ever wonder if your parents made you gay…like you saw this and ✌️
I wonder if maybe they preslice the pizza before they bake it.Thisthen allowing the slices shift out of wack.
I love the video, it really was about nothing but enjoyed every second. Excited to hear your pod cast for sure.... also super glad your back to you smiling and having fun 😀
I just watched 40 min of… nothing. Why is this on trending. Why are the comments so positive. I wasn’t big on the cancellation or anything but this was just genuinely so uninteresting. Even as a big fan years ago I just don’t get the hype on this so far. Also what was that intro????
posting this clearly 'poking the bear' at Chuck E Cheese speaks volumes to the reckless self-destructive nature Shane's living at this point. Good luck not getting sued ig
This made my heart happy 🖤
I like Shane, but can we have Jenna back too?
Loved the pizza update!
Omg I can’t believe I thought tight p- energy and .5 seconds later Chris said it. 😂
Shane! I needed a good time. Thank you for this ❤️
OMG - I haven't literally laughed out loud so many times in a video in such a long time!!! Thank you!!!!
No alert sent.  YOU TUBE SLACKING.  The only way I knew video had dropped was from the post from RYLANDS VLOGS.
I AM SO HAPPY YOU'RE BACK!
💚💚🥺💚 I'm so happy!!!
So funny that Urgent Care is in the background while you're looking at the pizza
i fr laughed so hard
It’s dangerously delicious for me.
I missed THIS💜
Again as I said on your last vid :  THIS IS THE ONLY THING KEEPING ME ALIVE RIGHT NOW
I'm confused
Shane ur not the only one that saw 2022 when younger and being like well I’m not gonna be there
Welcome back Shane.
I was dead ass dying laughing you made homework fun.
I will watch whatever video you make!!!! You’re amazing!!!! Missed you so much 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I feel bad for Ryland im dating a bisexual man I know how he feels  :/
That Ironman got me lol
IM SO HAPPY YOU ARE BACKKKKKKKKK🥺😭 I missed you so much Shane🥺
Oh boy...was really hoping that we were moving on from the past and not revisiting it 😕
I'm so excited for this podcast
Kill Bill shirt love it! 💕 Your OG fans get you shane do you man! 💕
Just so happy to see you doing well and thriving in Colorado and getting back to a good place in your life!! Just please remember to ALWAYS put your mental health before youtube or any other platform, the toxicity here, is not worth your happiness!! Love u Shane!!
Did Chuck E Cheese threaten you, Shane? Blink twice if yes. A minute later: DAMN, I KNEW IT Edit: I still think they recycle pizza. Literally no other pizza looks like that though. NONE. Not at other restaurants. Not when you make pizza at home. Not when you go to your friends for pizza. None. 😂
Why doesnt Shane wear his ring, but Ryland does?
i missed shane so much 😩
Thursday is my b-day I was upset then I seen a new video by Shane made my day 💯 better
Fuck i missed Shane so much!!!
This was amazing lmaaaaaaaaaao   Shane being P.C to prevent anymore cancelations 😂  jk jk  - from a 12+ year shane dawson fan, ride or die and canceled or not will always be a stan haha
When I saw the notification I RAN to the tv to watch.. then about 5 mins in I remembered I had a husband.. and that I was a house wife.. & I had to cook dinner.. so here I am at 12:40am enjoying this video. Love love love it! Missed you so much shane! Love you ❤️😘
Adam and Eve, durex and ann summers need to get in the chat
COVID 19 VACCINES ARE NOT VACCINES!. I AM BEING SHADOW BANNED BY COMMUNIST YOUTUBE TO SILENCE THE TRUTH TO KEEP THE MASS AT BAY UNTO SUBMISSION OF THERE AGENDA OF ECONOMIC RESET THAT IS COMING FROM ALL KNOWN, AND ALL PLANNED COVID 19.  THIS WAR IS SPIRITUAL, AND NOT NATURAL.  ANSWER. JESUS CHRIST
Keep making videos please ❤️🅿️
Get to the point.
Shane I swear I will FaceTime you and show you why it comes out like that lol I worked in a pizza place for 13 years!
I think Shane looks amazingggg. So much healthier, there’s a glow about him now and looks like he lost weight. Love that for him ☺️
Laughed with you whole video. Can't wait for more videos.
Love to see you back and doing well! I have missed your silly random videos! They were always my favorite!!
Look at someone paying a company to make sure there are only good comments on here. 😂 your other socials tell a different story. Checked Twitter lately? Just stay off YouTube
The irony that there’s an urgent care walking distance from Chuck E. Cheese 😂😭…👀
Omg yesss i hope the ratched food videos come back🤗
the urgent care right next to the chuck e cheese just.... makes sense 😂💀
I'm just so happy your making videos and just being you. You needed the Break Shane now you can come back Betta than Eva 😁😍 yeaaaaaa
I love how all over the place this video is in the beginning 😂
About time bro Edit: marry ryland! Life can be short don't waste time about the what ifs!
We've missed you beyond words Shane. Please upload more, you have no idea what positivity your videos bring to people like me who struggle with depression.
nobody cares
IM SO EXCITED FOR THE PODCAST WELCOME BACK SHANE❤️😮‍💨
This was funny. They shouldn’t sue you because your videos probably helped their sales go up.  I can’t believe that you paid $80.00 for 3 pizzas that were cheese, pepperoni and a half in half pizza. That’s the conspiracy as to why they are so expensive.
16:29 HUHHH
Chris’s voice has changed
The slices shift when they are cut and makes them look uneven
Pushing 🅿️
welcome back shane i missed you
the fact that theres an urgent care right next to the chuck e. cheese enough said
This video had me DYING. Brought so much joy into my life, thank you 😂
I want it all .. Shane I’m so happy you’re posting
Yay!!
I love Ryland, he’s unapologetically himself and I love that ♥️♥️
14:58 HAAHAHHA
Oml I love your shirt ! And I loved the video ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ
I haven’t laughed this hard at a video in a long time!!! 😂😂
I laughed thru the whole video welcome back
Is he trying to capitalise and make money off his fallacies?
I'm down for the podcast. I was having vertigos and when I woke up and saw the notification almost run in a werid way to see ya. I missed you so much
I've missed you so much <3 Thank you for lighting up my life to make me laugh and smile!
🅿️ 🤪😂 I'm dying 🤣  you guys are so silly
I came here for Shane’s brother , cut the crap already
Can we have your LA house? We’re a cute lesbian couple and we’re big fans. 🥰👀
Dam.... These guys still make me cackle😂
i’ve always loved and supported you. when you went through that dark period where you didn’t post, it was hard not having a source of light in my life. i’m so so glad you’re making a comeback, especially in such a positive way. i absolutely love you shane!
Lmao just died laughing when shane said. So your at goodwill. Youre buying my merch lmao
Ok.
I fucking loved this video. ❤️
Watching the ads all the way through for you! :) lol glad your back.
I’m so glad is still the Shane we know and love! So glad you came back! Don’t leave again!
fyi, i nvr unsubed... and I nvr canceled him.
Do a Queen Mary thing.
Shane.. Y’all always crack me up.. Love you guys..❤️
11:53 LMAO. WOAH-
Some people just think people can't change and mature overtime and it's so annoying..
Yessssss the food videos!!!!
Peep the urgent care in the background 🤣
WE MADE IT 🤪😂🙃
dnt sleep on Chuckie pizza its the best
I'm so excited for the podcast.  I'm so bored of the ones I listen to and 2 of my favorites stopped 💔
i will literally watch and enjoy anything u post! please keep posting. it helps me and so many other people
When I got the notification of your new video, I was surprised. I've always loved your videos and am looking forward to seeing whatever you choose.. podcast, conspiracy, whatever makes you happy 😊 ❤
I missed youuu
The truth about Shane dawson was
pushin P
Ryland in the background of this vid just seems like he’s on drugs lol or just simply enjoying life
Urgent Care in the same parking lot 🤣
The IT reference had me rolling. 😮‍💨🤣
Can’t wait for this https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Krla_UxRg
I fucking missed you Shane, I've been going through it!
Shane content is what we need.
I don’t care at all about conspiracy videos. Stick to the makeup. Shane glossin!!!!! Vlogs are good too
My life was so empty without you on my YouTube feed!❤️
this guy probably gets rid of all the bad comments
Watching ur video with my 3 yr old, only thing he noticed is chucky e cheese and now wants me to take him lol thanks
I love this video sm!! Cant wait to get another notification for another video .
I should go get a pizza tomorrow..🤔
this is exactly what i want
U have to bring out that black pig tumbler u have in your beauty room I like it js
Laughing so hard haha love you! TPE 🤣🤣🤣
EIGHTY DOLLARSSSS?
Shane u ever thought about doing stand up?
Order a pizza and ask them not to slice it and see how it comes.
*If you speak/understand Spanish* , and are really into conspiracy type of videos there is a YouTuber called *PARAFANTASTICO* and he's pretty good 🤗
I'm gonna assume that the pizza is recycled BUT not from anyone's plate or anything gross. In some places (countries), like where I'm from, we have the option to order single slices or a whole pie. I don't know how Chuckecheese does it, but I'm assuming if they have people ordering single slices. they would still bake the whole pie and serve whatever the customer wants. The left overs from that pie are still clean and not contaminated, so if someone orders a half and half pie, they would use that instead of baking another fresh pie when they still have some left from a previous pie that are still clean and edible. In short, instead of throwing away good parts of a whole pie away, they would still serve it, top it off with cheese and reheat it. Which I think, is ACCEPTABLE. Maybe the PR from chuckecheese didn't want to admit it since not a lot of people would accept it, and might think it still GROSS when in reality, it's reducing food waste. That is possibly why some parts of the pie aren't consistent in sizes, I highly doubt they would be serving pizza from someone else's plate or any pie that has any contact from a customer.
I love that you are back with videos your honestly amazing
7:16 OMG- 💀😭😭
I totally got the part of watching movies and being like well I won’t be there lmfaoooo
we know what u did you nasty man
Actually loved this. Welcome back!
Honestly if I had the money I’d buy your old house
Serious do you have that much merch?? I’m glad to see you back!! You both are keeping things real and I enjoy that about your videos!! Move forward Shane and Ryland!! :)
6:41 PF-
Shane gets pounded by men🙀🙀
6:21 💀
Shane slays😻💯💯😘😘
Disappointing clickbait
OH MY GAWD, I MISS YOUR VIDEOS SHANE!! I JUS GOT YOUR MERCH 'OLD OR NEW' I DONT CARE!! THANK YOU FOR BEING YOU!!!
Oooooo yes lol can't wait to watch 🤗
Who is this Chris sexy voice?
Tbh I don’t care what you do I’ll still watch you
the fact i’ve been here since day one. i love seeing you and me grow. thank you for never giving up <3
Ty so much for posting this shane. My depression is literally the worst it has ever been but this made me want to die less.
Okay I love how real this video was
Honestly Shane I’m glad you’re back I was one of the few people who still supported you through you’re break n I did receive negative feedback myself because of it but I still love your videos I wish to meet you cuz I think we would get along I honestly did something that I can’t believe I did n my one friend tried to control my life but now I’m free n I feel as if I can do anything so both of us feel like nothing n your videos helped me stay happy please make more videos of you being you no matter what Chuck E Cheese says you’re funny n I’m very glad that you’re back n even though you will probably not see this cuz I’m late to the party n there is over 10k comments already I jus want you to know that u still have this loyal fan no matter what as yes I watched you when shanaynay was still here with my sister n now I’m going to be in my early 20s so you know I’ll still be subscribed n watch your vids for as long as I live keep it up and stay positive because when you are then you know there will be at least one other person who will be happy too
Shane, I really would appreciate if you put some effort into your videos. Like this, the sound quality is crap, there is a camera person that is completely pointless, the video makes me seasick and the actual content of this boils down to about 10 minutes max. Like, I like you and I’ve been subscribed since Shanaynay days with various accounts but I’m not enjoying this.
10 minutes in & Shane feels so different and I love it. Like he’s not scared to speak his mind.
Did Chuck E. Cheese make you do this? Are you being held hostage? Blink twice for yes 😂
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Just another person who really really missed this. Shane, you are reaching people just by being you and doing this video. It was my first smile of the day, thanks for the little escape. Keep going
Love you Shane! Glad to see you back. 💜
In the first clip of the video, I have a question in theory: What if there is an actual person putting their voice into someone's brain like you're the only person who hears this voice and no one else does, however, this person can be using something like a device and we do not know if it is a mental illness that caused us to react to it? Because my theory is that if it is possible whoever created this device can be trouble and dangerous and live normally like the rest of us. I do not know that's just my theory, sounds crazy, but it is a theory of mine.
Shane looks skinnier😱
If I saw these guys wearing these outfits yuppp I would be like just another day in sunny beautiful chaotic Southern Cali💯🌅💃 This kind of outfit sight is as normal as seeing as a man sucking on a pacifier while wearing a tutu with fairy wings on L.A. metro 🤣🤦🤣   The normalcy in Southern Cali is sometimes oddly way to much woth the comfortably of oddities🌜😆🌛 -Mercy(sorry for the name confusion i am on my dad's phone at the moment)  P.S. I am 33 and you don't want to get me started with what doesn't phase me and what it takes to straight up weird me out make me give the WTF stare here in Southern Cali BAHAHAHA!!! 😂🤗😂
Loved, loved,loveeeeed the video💖 Welcome back babes🥰
Ryland talking about Shane not marrying him... Shane: I just don't like all the people and wearing a suit and blah blah blah to change the subject. Ryland bring it back up offering a quiet wedding with only close family... Also Shane: that's boring and non-romantic. CMON SHANE just marry the man and be done with it! Have a small one if it makes you more comfortable, but you'll both be happier once its done :)
plz being back the food vids. Make a new trend. You are still the viral queen. Take your crown back.
40:40 “if I have dige-diWOH👀 digest-WOO😟 digestional(?) issued ”
Ryland asking " Why is she green?" Killed me.
I just watched the other Chucky video a few days ago omfg❤️
Every 90's kid in Australia being shocked O'Brien stole the theme song from some place called O'Rielly
Missed you<33! Hope you’re feeling better n thriving!
It’s the Chuck E. Cheese pizza part for me lmao
i think it’s very fitting that there’s an urgent care in the same parking lot as the chuck e. cheese <3
Pizza Hut uses a big pizza cutter we don’t have that problem. never have I seen this happen and when we do half and half it’s one pizza toppings put on half and half never two separate pizzas so I would love to know what there doing for it to look like shit because if we even deliver a pizza to the customer and it looked like that we would have to remake it and would understand why to
Liked it before watching 💕 anything you post at this point is everything 😭
Rylands outfit I’m crying
Shane Dawson podcast would be AMAZING!!!
Yassss I love a 40 + minute video from Shane :)))
This is so chaotic and I’m here for it 🤣🤣
And $80 for 3 pizzas!!! I guess that makes sense if you are paying for multiple pieces of different pizzas…😂😂😂
Hooey and Pooey.
Haven't watched Shane's content in years and have been unsubscribed for a while but the preview of his upcoming video makes me wanna resubscribe! I've been so fascinated by the theory of life being a simulation for so long I'm excited to see his brother's take on it (I think that was his brother??)
Literally haven’t laughed this hard in SO long. Thank youuuu Shane 🤣😭💕
Definitely missed laughing my ass off watching your videos
eating dominos wile waching
9 minutes in and my gut hurts from laughing 😂 I missed you Shane!!! ❤️
Amazing video Shane!!! We'll take whatever you make! We all love you and ryland❤️
You seem so happy. So happy for you. Your a joy. Missed you
Shane coming back proves that cancel culture doesn't exist. The only one who can cancel Shane is Shane himself.
I got so excited when I saw that you posted a new video!!! Yay!! Loved it you guys are so funny!!! So happy you are doing so well and are happy again!!!
I appreciate everything you give to us 🥰
you guys are hilarious
Amazing AMAZING made my month ❤️
This was so fun loved how Shane was his true self and not giving af lol but Did ryland really say EIGHTY DOLLARS for those three pizzas???!!!!???!?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This was just so much fun to watch, i missed you, welcome back :D
This what we didn't know we needed and that why your in our lives Shane. You are a Master at bringing us new content we discover we didn't know we needed
you're literally my anti-depressant hahah short term unfortunately (whenever a video appears)hahah but good while it last
You should have checked if your odd shaped slices fit in your other pizzas. Maybe it something they do purposely , like a trend 😅😅
My god i love u shane !!!! I missed u so much!!
So did they give him back monetization?
Yay! I didnt expect this but i needed it! Great job shane!
I wish Ellen could be on your podcast
He's back!!!! I laughed so hard 😂. Thanks for the amazing content! We are here for it!!!!
This specific frame in this YouTube video has me fucking dyinggggg 8:30 lmaoop
❤️💕🥰 omg don’t follow this man lol 😜😘😍
I still 10000% believe the chuck e cheese conspiracy
Yay!  It’s about time you came back.
Ah I’ve missed you, Shane! It’s so good to see you in this type of video. You can tell you’ve really worked hard on yourself ♥️
Lol! Love the video. & im sooo happy to see you back!.. Something with you, just makes me feel happy.  Your humour and realness. Hugs! Shane. ❤🌟🌟🌟
im genuienly entertained by this and that concerns me so much
I missed you & your videos Shane ❤️❤️❤️
Get that damn truck a wash
I came to the comments to figure out what 🅿️ stood for lmao
Ur old food videos would be fun to watch again, I enjoyed watching this and laughed the whole way thru. This is the kinda content I need at 6 am :)
I'm so excited for what's coming this year! You have been missed shane, I was so happy when I saw this video <3 welcome back!
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Just another person who really really missed this. Shane, you are reaching people just by being you and doing this video. It was my first smile of the day, thanks for the little escape. Keep going
I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. I f****** LOVE YOU SHANE!
Ngl I feel home again!! Love his videos and humour this is the pick me up I needed❤️🥺
hello shane we missed you
AYEEEE!! I didn’t get a notification for this tho wtf yt
love thisss <33
shane, this is exactly what i want
Welcome back I was so excited
I'm not feeling P
Yes queen
That was so fucking great ugh i missed Shane♡
I'd love daily uploads with 17 ads from Shane tho 😭 🖐️
I miss you Shane. 😭 Glad you’re coming back!
Watching ryland cringe and get jealous of Chris is so interesting to watch. Like you never see his jealous side and it’s nice to see him show more interest in Shane than what we normally see. Really makes me see you guys as my peers instead of some crazy YouTube lifestyle. I live for intimate stuff like this
Hey Shane let me have the Titanic poster before you move 🥰
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life
Shane's camera guys need to stop chuckling behind the camera. Stfu! So distracting. Couldn't finish video.
Mm. I’m sorry. I enjoyed the vid, but you were really rude to ryland so many times. I’m bi too and I would never “joke” with my boyfriend about him having a vagina multiple times while he’s clearly over the joke. And then also joking about cheating on him with Chris. It’s..a lot. If I were you, I’d try not to do that anymore. You’re funny without making people possibly feel bad or preying on insecurities. It just made me a bit sad. And then you made a joke about making friends feel shot for a joke and you e literally done that for many years. So I don’t get how you almost acted like it wasn’t true. Anyway, wish you the best man
Shane check out food theory they have a good thoery/reason why the pizza is the way it is
Chris giggles behind the camera 😂
Welcome back. I laughed the whole time.  It's great to see you happy 😊
despite all the hate and cancellations, shane has always been my comfort youtuber. he just gives me nostalgia and I love it. i will always stand by shane (yk, unless he murders or R🦧 someone)
omg!!! Shane  i never laughed so hard..... miss you , I hope to see  more  :)
Imagine Shane doing a conspiracy theory video about COVID! O m g
I loved how u dressed up for chuck-e- cheese
ngl the whole video are funny
Before you know, you dont know
Can you acknowledge that ur basically begging the ppl who cancelled u to come back , bc ur still making it seem like it was ur choice to take a break
makes me uncomfortable that they all keep bringing up emma’s brand it comes across really weird
Love you boo it's all fun and games I think we know that and yass would love all your videos
When pigs fly they will get married, do more videos , interview YouTubers like Emma chamberlain. Love Shane and Ryland
This was fun, I've missed you guys!
Love you Shane!
Next time, ask them not to cut the pizza
Glad he’s back but is it just me or are these kind of videos now awkward or cringe? Hopefully it’s just me but I’m waiting for the conspiracy vids
We miss you Shane! Luv n light from bloody Harlan Kentucky! 🍷 💕🍷 💋🍷❤ Soooo awesome your back !!!
Don’t care what people say! I fucking love Shane! Still the original queen B of YouTube ! 😂😍
You should get married at Disneyland!
Please keep putting out content, you really are carrying us through some of the darkest times. I've watched every Ryland vlog that has come out with my room mate because ya'll genuinely bring us happiness.
Just leave again
I missed these types of videos 😂
Have you tried to turn the whole pizza pie upside down? You usually can see the different cook marks on the bottom of the dough.. it might make more sense
You were such a big part of my teenage years, I’ve been following you for such a long time, throughout all the changes I’ve always followed you. Happy to see this video. 🖤❤️
I was laughing this whole video! Love
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Just another person who really really missed this. Shane, you are reaching people just by being you and doing this video. It was my first smile of the day, thanks for the little escape. Keep going
Really enjoyed this video, Shane seems happy and it definitely comes across in the video! Hopefully more of these to come !
Welcome back Shane 🥺
Missed you !
I Took a public speaking class and in my class there was a Chuck E. Cheese employee who actually told us the same thing about the pizza cutters that they were really big and that they had difficulty cutting it in the same size so I’m not sure what to think
Shane literally invented YouTuber and Influencer podcasts I'd be so excited for him to return to making them
The discussion about the lawsuit starts at 19:09
I left my homework for this.. i love it ! welcome back, i missed you!
I still need an explanation why does the pizza look like this ??? It’s def not the same pie but what’s happening
Ah I’m glad I never stopped being a fan ! ❤️
I still have all my merch
Shane, it's SOOOO good to see you back on YouTube!! I'm an OG Fan and LOVE to see how happy and BALANCED you have become WITHOUT losing YOURSELF!!! I have checked your channel EVERY WEEK for a video since your last upload, and was EXCITED to see you posted... I'm so proud of how much you've taken the TIME (REAL FUCKING TIME OFF YOUTUBE!?!?!) to reflect and grow. Personally, I think this is a YouTube FIRST!! Many say they are going to take time to reflect, and they're back a week later (I WON'T mention any names... *COUGH-COUGH Logan, Gabby, and a few others a LITTLE to close to the story... Hint! Hint!)... I know I'm really a nobody... Just some lame chic on the interwebs... And we don't know each other personally, nor have we ever met... But It's been a real treasure to watch you grow from a kid trying to find them-self, to the authentic REAL person (A.K.A. Real Bear, or mouse?? LMAO) I see today. I'm a recovering addict with 9 years of sobriety, so I know what it's like to feel that everyone you know and adored has turned their backs on you, especially as your world crumbles around you. And the world isn't so forgiving... I lost my fiancé, my 3 kids, my job, reputation, and self-respect in such a short amount of time. And it's SO HARD to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and gain that self-respect and PASSION again. *** Oh, and about RYLAND... MARRY HIM ASAP!!! I've been married and divorced 3 times, twice before I was 22 and again before I turned 28... And the UNIVERSE can see you two are SOULMATES (too cheezy?)... I'm sure it was tough, and there were probably times you two wanted to MURDER each other, but you two stuck it out and made it to the other side. I have seen 35-40 year relationships not make it through an INTH of what you two have faced together. You, Shane, and that DARLING young lad, Ryland, were made for each other... You can see it when you two look at each other and even from the honey on your voices when you talk about the dumbest and most simple things... People search a lifetime for a partner who "GET'S" them. So, you put a ring on, NOW Lock It Down (Joking)... OK, OK.. I know this has become a novel... and I KIND OF apologize. HEY!! Maybe this message isn't meant for you or Ryland. MAYBE someone else needs to see it in your video and read these words... Maybe it's both... IDK, so ill leave you with THIS: From one HUMAN LIFE to ANOTHER, I'm proud of you. You got this!! Keep up the shenanigans! novel...
❤️❤️❤️
What I would do for daily videos from Shane again Omg ! I love love love your content !!! And it’s sad that we will never get back the years you were gone
Shane you should go somewhere haunted again but also try not to get anymore demons
When he said all of their guest list left them, I LOST IT.
I miss you Shane! 🤍 Also yes to the podcast, your old podcast with Jess was my favorite thing ever
Interesting that you are still trying to make content in a world where the only people who tolerate you are the ones that don't know you
wait why did he leave again? was it something bad or something?
I FUCKING LOVE SHANE DAWSON OMGGGGG
Love you guys so much great video! Give hugs & kisses to the animals for me!
This is fucken stupid.
“ do you want these regular or stuff crust” “…..mix? 🤷🏼‍♀️”   I’m dead 😂💀 I’m literally sobbinggggg.
Am I the only one who’s distracted that Shane didn’t get his drink he ordered 😂
This was the best video I’ve seen in a while.  I was laughing the whole time!
I hate him
Ryland does not have stretch marks, he has a tight vagina!
I have bad anxiety and depression but your videos always make me feel  better.
I swear you could make a video doing literally anything on the planet or nothing at all and its guaranteed to be entertaining. I needed this thank you for the giggles💛
Do a podcast ! I would love it!
Hearing you talk about the podcast actually made me jump in my seat! Follow your dreams, you will always have support alongside with you!! I can’t wait☺️☺️
nigga why are you back
I get it.
why are all the comments so supportive 💀
I was hoping for that 19.9 to change to 20 almost had it maybe next time.
Omgeee I fucken love you Shane!! You’re so funny and charismatic! Man I missed you! Welcome Back!
So glad you’re back. Love you Shane♥️
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Just another person who really really missed this. Shane, you are reaching people just by being you and doing this video. It was my first smile of the day, thanks for the little escape. Keep going
Omg thank you Shane so happy you are back you have no idea so you better not pretend like you do ❤
He posts it trends again cancelling is such a lie lmaoooo.
8:55 have me dying LMFAOOOOOOO this whole videooo
I think the Chuck E Cheese recycled theory is funny, but as an ex employee I’ve never seen pizza recycled. I’ve definitely seen gross things, but never reusing pizza (at least not for the customers). Most of their employees are teens, and the pizza cutter is a rocking one. Which makes it, imo, harder to cut evenly. I worked there for about 5yrs and MAYBE cut a handful of pizzas evenly.
Um yall just gonna forget what he did?
I am so happy you’re posting again! Anything you make always puts a smile on my face & makes my day!! You’re the best and always my fave❤️❤️❤️🥰✨✨✨✨
I think they make a cheese pizza and a pepperoni pizza. Then take half of each one to make a whole pizza when it is ordered half and half. The whole cheese pizza looked rather decent. 🤷🏼‍♀️💕❤️💕
Laughing in the first 2 mintues, missed your natural sarcasm and humor
🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️
surprisingly fun !!not woke shit  and some dark humor   loved it!
I love you Shane!!! Welcome back ♥️
❤
I know you are going to appreciate this saying..... I bi alot of shit😂🤗 Glad you back Shane. Why don't you make a documentary about suicide? Talking about it and guidelines to help people and so on shane?
$80 for 3 pizza omg that’s insane
IMAGINE HAVING TO GO TO COURT OVER A FUCKING CHUCK E CHEESE PIZZA CONSPIRACY VIDEO - dude that’s so funny
I ordered pizza from Round Table and the pizza looked shifted as well. So scary!
I missed this Shane!! Your hilarious!! thank you 🙏🏼
I loved it.
YAS SHANE LOVEE UR VIDS
🎶 Oh, oh, oh, oh Rylaaand... 🎶
Yesssssss conspiracy, alien theory podcast. 😬🤞🏽😍
Don't throw it away. Bring her back for the next customer 💁🏽‍♀️🍕 🍕 🍕
Yes second cmt but as a pizza chef-that girl is complete bullshit. The cutting process is done with a rocking back n forth knife to cut faster. Takes 2-3 seconds. Even with a standard hand cutter-3 seconds
Omg, I'd love to spend an entire week with you guys! You are all amazing! We love you Shane (and Ryland!)  Welcome back!!
Omg i love you shane. This video was honestly EVERYTHING. I laughed so much. Need more videos from you. #nevercanceledinmybook
YOU ARE #3 ON TRENDING CONGRATULATIONS SHANE!!!!!
Very well said Shane on saying good things about you and God and how we our all put together
Only 700k views in 7hrs ? :(
can't wait for your collab with coolguywithglasses!
Ok..but I would like Shane to sit down and have a conversation / interview with Jenna Marbles. The internet misses her and her content 🤍🙏🏼
Yes podcast!
It would be funnier if his shirt said kill Shane instead of kill bill
the videos i miss dearly are singing with headphones
This is exactly what we wanted Shane. This pizza was iconic 😂😂😂😂
Lol umm can i just say Shane... Chrissy Crumblz. You're welcome ☺
"Shane, the only way that I can figure out how you & Ryland got so rich is that you took your book money and heavily invested in Bitcoin and then cashed in. I am sorry to say, tired out Pig merch just doesn't have the sales volume to buy 2 mansions."
I literally haven't laughed this much while watching a YouTube video in awhile 😂
I've been engaged since the start of the pandemic and haven't done a thing.  I hate weddings and I have ✨anxiety✨Anyway, Can't wait for more content Shane!
Well I haven’t laughed like that since the last Shane video😂 welcome back
He looks so happy❤️ Omg i can’t wait to watch more videos🤩
found thru a google search, an ex employee said “Chuck E. Cheese requires all their pizzas to have the same number of slices. The magic number, in this case, is 12, but since the dough is made fresh in the kitchen, the pizzas don’t come out perfectly circular. When they start cutting the pizzas, there’s not always the right number of slices and some slices come out larger than others. To compensate, some slices are cut in half and rearranged to create a whole pizza with exactly 12 slices.”
Keep making videos 💗
Omg you made your first come back after being canceled!!! I'VE MISSED YOU SHANE!!!😭😭😭😭😭 This youtube streets are cold.
I missed this shane!
Shane I finally started my podcast after years of c*ckblocking myself haha anyway I'm just an agoraphobic-hermit, who lost her marbles & ended up doing stand up comedy.. CAN I INTERVIEW YOU SHANE? Your mental health fuckery is so up my alley haha for real you're an inspiration for all of us riddled with anxiety and depression.. Anyway I thought I'd take a chance and drop a comment, cross my fingers & maybe the universe will make it happen 💜 ETA my podcast 'Mouth Hole' is on Spotify & Youtube  Gahhhh wtf am I doing?
❤️ you Shane keep up the great work.🙌🏽
WOW AM I CRAZY OR ITS THISSSSSSSSSS REALLY LIKE HIS FIRST "OFFICIAL" VIDEO BACK ON HIS CHANNEL??? MINUS THE FIRST FEW HAUNTED ONES BUT "BABY" UM YA UR GETTING SUED!!! NOT A GOOD CHOICE UNLESS UR LOOKING FOR TROUBLE! LOOK OUT WHEN SHANES IN A "GOOD MOOD" YIKES ROFLMFAO

Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Just another person who really really missed this. Shane, you are reaching people just by being you and doing this video. It was my first smile of the day, thanks for the little escape. Keep going

THE DISCLAIMER BYE
I dread the watch time on this video when I saw it but I ended up watching it in one go. You guys are so entertaining.   Just a note on Chris/Christopher Robin/Christina, the camera is so shaky the whole time. Plus the random out of focus close up is a bit much. Love your humor too though!
i was laughing so hard by the end of this. i missed you Shane. we all did. thank you.
So basically hes rich now woo
I have laughed so hard in so long 🤣🤣🤣
Love your dreamy, star-filled office 🌟🌌💗
I missed his videos so much!!!
Conspiracy podcast with Kendall Rae since y’all both in CO now? 👀
when you said you are back you felt something I felt that
not gonna lie i  didnt expect the f150 lol
the not tease full drop - boom! im in!
It all depends on the employee how much pressure they put on the cutter as they cut towards the outer towards the crust and move that piece with the cutter! Sorry, just a theory. And becomes out of place 😂
I loved this :) you seems happy to film again and I’m glad you decided to upload it ❤️❤️❤️
That's so P! lol
A new podcast would be EVERYTHING. I loved the old one so much, I've been watching you since grade 7 (I'm 24 now lol) and whenever i'd have really bad anxiety or nightmares I would always turn the podcast on and it instantly calmed me down. Love you Shane, so happy you are back!!!!
So glad your back!! I have missed you. Keep going no matter anyone says!!!
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Just another person who really really missed this. Shane, you are reaching people just by being you and doing this video. It was my first smile of the day, thanks for the little escape. Keep going
https://youtu.be/6KyEef1P2ds
What a great return video! 🥰
The camera guy needs to stop snorting.  It's very annoying
It’s the Urgent Care in the same parking lot for me🤣 Definitely not P.
Chris Crumbl 🤨
Omg, please do more conspiracy videos!!! I miss them! Also, im glad you're uploading again😁
If you look thru the comments you see there's the same comment multiple times by bots lmao, they buying comments now
So how come my player is makin me depressed
Heeee'sssss back baby
That was a great video!
Laughing so hard at the pizza segment - after noting that an 'Urgent Care' was located across from pizza place.
The mouse on the building is watching you!
I need COVID theories now!!!
P means playa lol. Keeping it playa
Yay Shane please start making more conspiracy theories I love them

You’re so funny, I love it
Not for nothing, we will take whatever you want to do! Oh God, I'm happy to see you on your own channel.  Yes, for the podcast, yes!!
this feels like an old vlog cause you guys are in la
Thus says The Lord of Hosts, to all the sons and daughters of this, the last generation of men: You have all inherited the error of your fathers, you have altogether become like them! Behold, you have surpassed the sins of ancient Egypt, when I poured out My wrath upon them! Your wickedness has increased beyond every tribe, people and nation, which has dwelt upon the earth!   THIS GENERATION IS WICKED  BEYOND MEASURE!...  Thus great wrath is stirred up,  And My indignation has come to the full!  My anger is fully aroused and  Shall surely be poured out...  RECOMPENSE for all nations!  RECOMPENSE for all these churches of men  Who have spoken presumptuously in My name!  RECOMPENSE for all these corrupt workers  Who have done falsely on My behalf!...  I HAVE NOT SENT YOU!   And you, O peoples of the earth, I have seen how you perform every form of evil at your leisure! You cease not from reveling in that which I hate! Behold, you murder the innocent, day and night, and plot evil against your neighbor! You stand up for the rights of those who commit abomination, and clap your hands as wickedness is celebrated openly in the streets!... O MOST PERVERSE AND ABOMINABLE GENERATION, SHALL I NOT REPAY?! Behold, My body is persecuted in every land, and My bride is murdered at the hands of idolaters! My people are bruised and beaten, My servants slandered and hated without cause! Therefore I am come down to take vengeance, to pour out wrath upon this people for all their wickedness!... I SHALL IMPART RECOMPENSE IN FULL! For I am The Lord, He who stretched out the heavens and hung the earth upon nothing. I am He who created all these worlds, He who causes all things to be. I am He who formed man from the dust of the earth and gave him breath, and he became a living soul. Behold, I spoke all life into existence, yes, I am He who called all things into existence, saying, “Arise and declare My glory!” For all creation obeys the sound of My voice. Yea, the whole universe declares My glory, for I am He who commanded the stars to shine their light and the galaxies to take their form. Behold, My voice reaches across the universe, and reverence is spread out before Me. For I command the hills to bow down and the mountains to be brought low, and it is so. Yea, the whole earth trembles when I pass by, for I am great in power and My glory has no equal! Thus the fear of The Lord goes before Me, and obedience follows after Me, says The Lord. Yet you peoples of the earth have turned from Me, and have rebelled against Me days without end! Thus I call upon the sons of men, even all who dwell upon the earth, to repent, to turn from your wicked ways, to bring forth new works worthy of repentance... Oh that justice would well up like water, and righteousness as an ever-flowing stream.[1] Yet you will not listen, you refuse to hear! WAYWARD GENERATION! Yes even you, O churches of men, have run far from Me, seeking always to be loosed from all accountability as you build yourselves up in your own false glory, that you might receive praise and recognition from men!   Behold, in your arrogance you have  Taken it upon yourselves to preach  MY Word from the pulpit, polluting it,  As though My words were subject to you  And your own private interpretation!...  O most arrogant and deceived generation,  How long must I suffer you?!...  How long shall you attempt to rebuild  Babylon and raise up Babel?! For you have restored Sodom and Revived Gomorrah from the dead!...  Surely the days of Noah have come in!  https://www.thevolumesoftruth.com/ABASEMENT
Wish u upload more! Great video by the way! ❤️
I loved this video I love you so much Shane you keep me going I. Life I literally look forward to watching your videos whenever you upload!!! I watch old conspiracy videos weekly. I’m obsessed with you LOL can’t wait for more videos ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I blinked and I was 38 minutes into this video. Sad. But so happy you’re back. Love you Shane!
Exited to see you are back! Love all the content
This legit made my night
lmaoo pls make TPE merch
❤️❤️❤️
Thanks for coming back Shane! My wife and I enjoy watching your conspiracies and plus we thought if Chuck E. Cheese’s employees maybe couldn’t make a “perfect round pizza” why does the crust still not connect? 🤔 lol thanks for the video!
The Urgent Care behind Chuck E. Cheese ain’t no coincidence 👀
YES I MISS YOUR FOOD VIDEOS SO MUCH
I'm honestly shocked that Chuck E Cheese stayed in business simply because of COVID and nothing else.
Ryland would be an otter and Shane is a bear. 80 dollars for three pizzas!?.
Omfg I’ve MISSED your humour laughed so hard more please!
I literally laughed so hard this whole video. You guys are hilarious and I can’t wait for more!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼😭😭😭😭
Me talk to my spirit guides
Love you Shane! Welcome back
I haven't laughed so hard in a while, make more videos 😭🤣🤣
I missed you!
HI WERE THE PSYCHIC TWINS. IM LINDA AND IM …
You are so funny!!!
🅿️ means real af, like keeping it real, like that’s what’s up. pushing 🅿️ is a song but it ultimately means real. **edit : ryland literally said exactly what i typed 2 seconds after i typed it.
Glad your back!
I tried SO HARD not to wake my roomates up while watching this late af… I failed. I WAS DYING! Never knew how much I really missed Shane until he came back to what he’s meant to be doing in life, making humans happy. Thank you for this! I really needed it after losing my job thanks to covid❤️
Yessssss Shane you’re back!!!!
@chuckucheese we support businesses that RECYCLE ♻️ ❤️🤣
"Why are people still watching this guy", I say as I watch the video
I used to work at a pizza place in high school(it was a mom and pop shop). I’m wondering if they aren’t using enough flour on their dough for one. Without enough flour, sections of the pizza can shrink inward and form a different shape than a circle. Two, I’m wondering if they don’t perforate their pizza? Perforating it would somewhat prevent it from having a shit ton of bubbles on it and could stop some of the deformities. Just a theory 🤷‍♂️
OMG I laughed SO hard at this video! Too funny!! I’m so glad you’re back Shane 💜 you’re the 🅿️ 🤣🤣🤣 ok kill me now cuz I just did that 😳😳😳🤣🤣🤣 plz keep posting Shane! It’s been awesome seeing you in Rylands videos . Question why does his mom call him Ryan but he goes by Ryland? Anyone know?? .
Omg, the jabs at Chuck E. Cheeses is so funny and spot on! 😂
The iron man killed me at the end
Keep talking about your experience with suicidal ideation, I lost my best friend 8 months ago and he was just 19. We need more people speaking up who have been through it themselves. Please help start the conversations on suicide prevention. Don’t be complicit to the stigma and shame.
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I can feel him getting canceled again real soon…. Ugh
This is so funny. keep uploading!
Shane should get an Adam and Eve sponsor.
Everything you make I love! I'm just so happy you uploading! I can't wait for more videos & the podcast! Love you so much! 😍😀😂🤗❤👐👏
So In reality P
this made me so happy. welcome back shane :) ❤️ i cant wait for the new videos !!!!
Thanks for the new video, Shane! And I'm studying to be a paralegal, so I love suing stuff... Either way, I hope you win the lawsuit lol.
WELCOME BACK SHANE!!!!!!🤩🤩🤩 so happy to have you back!!!  I laughed during the whole video!! I cant wait for more vidss
😂😂 love it thank You for sharing this video with us. 👋💞😀. When are you guys getting Married??❤️💋😂👋💞😀💞💞❤️
This is more of a demand than a request but I require more conspiracy videos with your brother please.   Many thanks in advance.
I love how annoyed Ryland was getting with all Shane's inappropriate comments. 🤣
Why would u get 3 large when you weren't gonna eat it
I've missed this so much. I haven't stopped laughing since you pulled up in a truck
okay but some of the pepperonis don’t even match uuuuppppp!
conspiracy videos and food videos were the first videos of yours i've ever watched, i'm so so so excited for more conspiracy videos!
Shane I missed you so much!!! Youtube is not the same without you… You always make my day/night! Please consider making more videos 🥺💓
HE BACK BABYYYYYY LETS GO!!!
Ugh I love your brother
It's so awesome to see you getting back to what you love and finding your happy. You are so funny and you really cheered me up. I have been sick and stuck in bed for a super long time and everything has just been a struggle and I really needed this. Thanks for being a ray of sunshine today.
We love you Shane !!!!!!! Best day is when you post
Just a quick note, they now have a frozen pizza you can buy. We saw it at Kroger,or in CA Ralph’s .
Shane and Ryland!! You both look so good!! Very funny, but I just started, watch it take a dark turn lol
First-seeing Shane so genuinely happy and laughing is EVERYTHING. I love that for you, and you make me giggle beyond belief.  “In my dream your vagina …” Me out loud : “Was TIGHT AF!” 😂  ❤️❤️❤️ I had to pause n cmt bc 12 minutes in and I’m loving it. Idgaf about your past-it’s in the past. Anywho, I’m always uplifted by you and ryland too-but you n I are the same age, have VERY similar issues and thought processes etc. I’m comforted by your strength and I hope soon-one day I too can get healthy and better myself. 💜
"Shane, a hole is a hole is a hole, feels so snug around your man part, you don't need to explain. However, your maternal instinct kicks in, and you need a kid to shower that all over. And Ryland just can't fulfill that instinct no matter how well you two get along fantastically. "
DO A FUCKING PODCAST! Nice to see u back queen!
It’s great seeing you being creative again
To summarize this video... Shane Dawson  tries not to get sued by the Rat.
This made my day, I’m so glad to see you Shane. You have really helped me through some hard times and it’s good to get this surprise video during the hard week I’m having .I laughed so hard watching this , can’t wait for the podcast. 😄
I’m glad to see you back
19:04 “we made it!!“ Literally had me crying😂 we did didn’t we
Shane you still that bitch! Yas!
I get so excited when you make a new video!!!!
We missed you Shane!
Loved loved loved the video!!!! 😘 So glade that your back! Laughed my ass off the whole time!!! The funny thing is is when ryland was eating the pizza and he was sitting in the back I don't know if anyone noticed but the urgent care was right behind your truck I find that very ironic lmao! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
OMG you are actually back!!!!! I didn't even know you were uploading again. Welcome back Shane I am so happy your back uploading!
I miss Shane
I don’t know if you ever going to read this but maybe the pizza it’s not round because maybe is hand made try to make a tortilla and it’s not gonna be a circle 😛
i do believe that the pizza dough is just hand made and so it’s not perfectly round
I’ve missed you so much!!! I’m so happy to see you making content again. Lots of love, Shane and Ryland!
OMG I so loved the randomness of this video. So glad you made it.
Please make a conspiracy theory video on Covid Lab Leak theory 🥺🥺♥️🥺
why this human still have a platform? can we raise our own standart?
Chris Crumbls- that’s what you can call him 😇
Shane, hon, I thought the goal was NOT to get sued! Seriously, I love you and have always supported you. I love watching Ryland's Vlogs with you. They are so good! Welcome back to posting on your channel. You have been missed. ❤💚💜💙💛
Shane,  YouTube Needs  you please,  come back ..and stay here, bieeeaaacchhh...don't leave ...I mean is it that you're so rich now,  that you don't have to work at all ..come on,  come on , come on,  don't leave us hanging like a low hanging fruit ..that's not what we are.. We are desperate...
Welcome back shane can’t wait to see more videos
I'm just glad that Shane's back!
I'm a bisexual woman in a straight marriage with a cis male. I legit had a dream that my husband had a vagina a few years ago!!!!! Lol I never told my husband about it though cause I felt like he would act the same way Ryland did. 😂😂 So, now I'm glad I never told him about the dream. LOL
Yay!! A Shane video!! It sure was a wonderful surprise, it made my day!  I hope you decide to really do more conspiracy videos, those were my favorites. You should take us with you to that psychic too. I think that would be fun and quite interesting. Especially since you think she may be real.  Good luck with the podcast, I hope it all goes well and turns out to be exactly what you set out for it to be!! I just hope you don't put it behind a pay wall tho, cuz some of us are broke out here lol!  🤟 🤗 💜
Awe I missed you
So nice to have shane content in 2022 <3
Why did I read this as the lawsuit of dream?? 😭🤚
I haven’t laughed this hard at a YouTube video in a while. So glad you’re back Shane!🖤
the queen is back!!! I missed these videos of yours so much where yall are just chilling and conversing. I was laughing so much during the whole video! I hope theres more stuff like this to come
This is boring af. Mfs need to get outside more and do something worthwhile for the environment.
"A mix🤭"  omg I laughed out loud lmao
They definitely delete comments lol
You are.. my biggest fan! 🤘
we love you shane!!
I laughed so much during this, felt great! I've had such a hard past few months and this made me enjoy the time spent watching. So glad you're back
Does any of this seem offensive to anyone else?
Pleeeeeease do more food videos, I miss them so much!! <3
Shane romping around casually to chuck e cheese in a Gucci track suit 😭😂 i’m 💀. I love you Shane ♥️ I was so happy to see this video!
I’ve seen Chuck E. Cheese frozen pizzas at stores lol
Yesssss to a podcast!! 🤩 my favorite person on the internet ever!
You uploaded on my daughter’s 21st birthday and she was the one that got me into you. while she is out partying I’m watching your videos 😂loved it! Looking forward to more! 😁
this is one of my fav vlogs from you.
If the pieces were all from the same pizza the pieces across from eachother would be the same size and they are definitely not...
shane im realizing that i got my sense of humor from you but we havent had it in a long time. now i feel like like i got a friend back. i do watch Rylands videos but you hide in them LOL
I used to love Chuck E Cheese pizza….
Omg 🤣🤣🤣 you're stuck with me just like my stretch Marks.
- [ ] Time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of future sins if you repent of them once you commit them, so you receive the gift of forgiveness by following him. When you start you have to stop sinning, and follow his word and obey it. That’s following Jesus. Read your Bible!!
Shane should’ve flipped the pizzas over to see if their were any burn marks that don’t match. They can put cheese and reheat it to make the pizza look new, but the underside of the pizza would still be cooked a different color than the others I think right?
Really fucking missed u Shane love u keep posting we all need it
i already know the new conspiracy series will send me into a spiral lol
I was looking forward to this video,I'm so glad your back Shane can't wait for whatever comes next,sending positive vibes
Literally can’t put into words how happy I am every time you’re back. This was fun! Keep doing what you do best, Shane! 💋
I love you shane , your doing great sweetie ❤️ u cure my depression! Made me still cry but not from being sad but from laughing !

Your videos have always made me be in a better mood! Glad to see you!
Welcome back omg Shaneeeee

You need to post more!! I miss your videos🙌🏽🙌🏽 you always have me cracking up 😂🤣👏🏽
Love you Shane ❤️ thank you for the long video. I had a terrible day today and your videos always cheer me up.
My next comment some how ryland seems more straight than Shane
NOT SHANE UPLOADING THE SAME DAY I HAD A MENTAL BREAK DOWN 😭😭😭🥺  I love you 💕 Edit: thank you for clarifying the 🅿️ because I also had no idea what it meant lol
I miss your daily videos!!!! The food videos!!!! The conspiracy videos!!!!
I am legitimately laughing out loud during the entire video
Ok... I haven't had chucky cheese pizza for Like 7 years. Now I want some 😅💀💀
Missed you so big
When u podcast can you please stop giving attention to literal trash like tana etc seriously 😒  no clout whores please  MAYBE THINK LIKE LOUIS THREOU* A FUN VERSION 🤗
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
This is actually what I wanted a hilarious  Shane video. Don't get me wrong I love learning about conspiracies from you but you are soooo funnyyyy I wanna see more of it in-between conspiracy videos ☺️🥰
I love you Shane and I know you don’t mean it badly but I’m not so comfortable with the fatphobia
We’re so glad you’re back !! I’ve been so depressed the past week . I’ve even been suicidal. But I’ve watched you since I was 13-14, and growing up with you I always loved your videos , you have always helped me get through tough times in my life. So thank you for this !! We love you Shane ♥️♥️
Feels so good to see these two again!
Welcome back, the laughter and light you & Ryland bring was very much missed ✨
No matter what you post I will always watch..
Rylan would be considered an otter and Shane is a cub 🥰
"Here's something you don't want." You presume to think we don't want anything and everything you make?!
Your the freaking best. You and ryland are the best. Ryland is the best. Even Christopher Robin is the best. The subject matter was so funny. So funny. My daughter loves that place. She calls it chunky cheeses
You had such high hopes for that pizza 🤣
Glad you're back, Shane!
I missed these random ass videos so much. My gay best friend was literally exactly like Shane, the way he talks, acts, etc. It gives me nostalgia about when he was still here, but it makes me happy because it’s like I can feel his energy through Shane’s videos. Pls don’t ever stop being you. ❤️
pushin 🅿️
What happened to the other camera man ?
This video was soo funny, I love you guys.
LMAO
ChuckEciron
bi-polar
I am crying and laughing 🤣
Not even 20 minutes in and I’m so happy your back!! I’m obsessed! I love to see how happy you are!
Oh my god the pepperonis don’t even line up 😬😢
Take heed!! There’s always some sort of urgent care/express care  facility not far from a Chuck E. Cheese
Get off YouTube
I freakin LOOOVED this! I was laughing almost nonstop, I need that. Thank you! I can’t wait to see more videos come from you Shane. Looking forward to when you start your podcast too!
I missed this so much!!
The return of the queen Mary
shane’s videos have always brought me out of dark places so this was a notification i needed right now
this video made me so happy!!!!
I was having a rough past couple of months, but now our King is back!!
Honestly I'm just surprised you even posted a video. I don't really care if it's a conspiracy video or just a normal vlog, I just wanna see a video where u have fun again and be happy with yourself. I'm happy that I got this notif today. Unexpected but happy
Omg I love Shane. I want to be best friends
its the 🅿️ for me 🤗😄😁
Shane has that bi-manic-goblin energy that I can relate to. He's imperfect and relatable in many ways.
I get it!
It was $80 for three pizzas? Now, that's the conspiracy!
OMGGG Yesssss!! I’m so all in on a Shane Dawson Podcast!! The best part of what you do, is you and your voice..(did that make sense lol) anyway how you entertain with your voice is what I’m sayin and this is a great idea! Can’t wait!
The filmer has such good energy, I love him
L+ clickbait
i absolutely love shane sm
It's really sad to lose that interest you once have with a certain youtuber like Shane then try watching again but the magic isn't there anymore. i used to really look up to you Shane, but sadly, it's not there anymore
I LOVE how happy Shane is! He seems like he's in such a better place mentally!
A podcast would make me happier than anything ❤
queen posted
The way your making your comeback is iconic, this is how it should be, you let the people breath and slowly incorporate more of you over time. I ❤️ you Shane. Glad your back and safe. Btw can you put out a new book? I loved your last two😂
ew
Liiiiivvviiing for this notification
If it’s not pee, it’s poo OR IF IT’S NOT PEEG 🐷 IT’S POOH 🤪
I started laughing out loud when Ryland said “tight” 😂
Before u know U DONT KNOW lol
Conspiracy theory...Half the comments say exactly the same things...🤔 Enjoyed the video 😁
Enjoyed the video!  So my wife and I worked at Chuck E Cheese through and shortly after High school.  The pizza is normally a little off because of the large crescent moon saw shaped knife, with handles on both sides, that you have to rock back and forth to cut, and the person making and cutting the pizza are Unexperienced teenagers and most pizza places use a pizza wheel style cutter.  The dough/pizza is actually made fresh every day.  I will agree it’s not very good and the ingredients are bulk bought and probably the cheapest available.  I hope that helps.  I will add that my wife and I were both traumatized from working there. Oh the nightmares 😂
Can’t wait for more conspiracy stuff. This was fun
I hope I see his murch at good will for cheep. More for me
Ryland: “Didn’t you used to honk? and now this year you’re going to take off” LMFAO IM-😭😭😭
I’m not even half ways through and I liked the video already,  you guys had me lmao 🤣 I love it so far and want more , I’m going to miss your home! Love you all! 💕 🐷 ps I have my shopping cart 🛒 ready for check out for Friday, hopefully it don’t sell out by then 😬
80 DOLLARS!? For 3 large pizzas? I feel like that’s crazy expensive
i wonder if you could order a pizza from chuck e. cheese and have them not cut it and see if they will do that🤔
That was really sexy how you said Ryland name while he said he was your lighting crew
I felt like I’ve been holding my breath! Hoping for this notification all this time!! Im so excited!! I see that spark ⚡️ in Shane again and I’m EXTREMELY EXCITED!! Im honestly so glad he’s back and smiling! Uhhh I’ve missed you!!  So Happy to have you back!
Ahhh I love you guys!!! Thank you for brightening my day.
Dammmm um when you get engaged you should start planning cause it can take years!! For location availability etc IM GATHERING RYLAND WOULD HAVE STARTED so what's happening ?! I need pics already! I organised my whole wedding in 3 months! But that was stress
chuck e cheese had 3 years to make their pizza look better and they still didn't improve.
"Oh thats not normal!?" LOLOLOL thats what I was thinking too, like Pffftt I wont be alive! Here i am all alive & shit.
I LOVE YOU
Here’s a conspiracy.. He comes back out when they take the dislike button away lol
Yay! Shane's back!
LOVE FILLED RANT: Im a huge fan of crass humor, hence why I’ve been watching Shane for ten plus  years. That being said I hate how nervous it make me seeing him make joke about anything to do with touchy subjects (Example the Gay jokes) we live in a age where comedy is taken different due to the platforms. If you went to see a stand up comedian it was always part of the norm for them to use shock type humor, say outrageous things. I see Shane as a comedian and hate that his humor has been weaponized against him. To his credit he’s shown so much  growth in him humor and how to be funny without the shock value all the time. Okay rant over I love Shane and wish for his happiness & success ✌️&❤️
Podcast for sure Shane more money & I need to borrow some so I can continue my journey traveling in a RV around the United States!
Ha‼️
wait i didnt think this was a conspiracy vid due to the title!! LETS FKING GOOOOOOO
wait a damn minute
OMG Shane I laughed so hard I love you !!!
39:30 there's an Urgent Care right behind you lol

"Im not talking about....bacteria" lmfao im not even sorry 😂🤷🏻‍♀️ Shanes humor gets me lolin
I don't care what anybody says ! But SHANE is the king of documentaries period 💯 I always get excited when Shane posts ❤️
Omg i ran to the video when I saw the notification 😩❤️❤️❤️ it was 🅿️
What the heck yeeeeeeeeeeeeees

I love that there’s an urgent care right across from Chuck E Cheese
These random videos are my favorites! You are so frickin' funny!
Go to Puerto Rico and elope. Maybe?
😐🤨
i love this video. especially going back and discussing the pizza theory lmaooo
No Shane, you are not a bear! A bear is a older man like me with hair in the gay community and yes over weight!
Oh my fuck Shane’s editing is ridiculous! Like this youtube video is literally scored like a movie 🎼 so freaking well !!
Sadly my family caught COVID because of Chuck E. Cheese 😬😬😬
Ready for the comeback f the haters comedy was different back then and he realized and knows this idc
I- I do get it lol
Dude I love Shane hahaha
I haven’t giggled like this is a while.  😂  I missed the chaotic energy and constant laughs. I can’t wait to see what this year brings for you guys! 😘  2022 = T.P.E. (Tight pussyyy energy obvs)
please upload more!! you were definitely missed❤️ your type of content is a one of a kind & is always needed, never forget that!
No, really Shane u are my favorite YouTuber ever !! I really appreciate u and ur videos u deserve better and I am so happy knowing ur back on youtube ❤️
I’m here for this energy!!!!🔥🤘💞🙏 all Shane content is 💯 food videos, conspiracy, podcast!! We here for it all baby☺️❤️
He looks like he’s lost weight and seems healthier
Post more please!! Need ya
O'REILLY'S!! Im dead!🤣
Please make the podcast with video from the start it’s much more enjoyable to watch.
what got me was they were like what does 🅿️ mean and shane was like i don’t know 😧🤔
“We made it Chuck E!!” Lmao
i’m so happy you’re back omg.
This made my day so much better. I was feeling so overwhelmed, anxious, and frustrated with life... I dropped everything I was doing and watched the video. I'm telling you Shane, you sure made things so much better in that instant you dropped the video. Love you ❤
I missed you Shane! I love you!! I’ve been watching you since the Fred is dead video keep making videos you love😇❤️ because I love watching them
This is so cringey
Chris is adorable
OMG IM LOVING RYLANDs beard 🙌🏼
The Chuck.E Cheese disclaimer with the little music popping up every 2 seconds KILLED ME each time 💀💀💀💀 gotta keep the lawsuit away ☝️
Their pizza is because they have a buffet. If you get Pizza Hut pizza that has a buffet it's still the same way when it's busy. They don't use trash or leftovers they pull it off the buffet line that may have different pieces from different individual pizzas.
Flip the pizzas over and look at how brown the crust is and if the bottom is evenly browned…
Who is this and why’s it on my recommended 👁👄👁
Chris you going on a trip 😂 oreo cooky was good 😂 Ryland.
Good to have you back 😆
*Sh@ne is disgusting and disturbed.*
I don’t think I’ve ever clicked faster on a vid🤧
https://youtu.be/pVgclWl25FA
As an ex Chuck E. Cheese worker who walked out after 3 months i am triggered 😭
*Chamberlain coffee sales drastically decline after this video* *Emma sues Shane*
Lmao I forgot how these videos went on…  4 minutes in and he hasn’t said anything 🤣  just words
You don't even know how much effort it took not to break my voice from screaming when I saw the first two sentences of this video
OK first off LOVED this video! Im so excited for what's to come, you seem so happy and that make me happy! I was so excited when I saw you were posting another new video!
We missed you!!! And your sense of humor 💕
I’m surprised Ryland went out in public wearing that.
I love shane and have always defended him, I love him in rylands videos because in my mind hes being his real self… In this video I feel like he is trying to be funny and talking talking about sexual shit, and it’s just not it.
Ryland, he jokes about not marrying you. It’s not funny. It isn’t funny that he flirts w the camera guy either. Tf?
Sorry Shane! I have to take sides with Ryland when it comes to movie's! It is a Taurus thing baby!
This January was my 21st birthday and I honestly never even imagined making it to my 18th so all jokes aside... we made it 🎉
I would totally wear tpe merch
I'm super down for the conspiracy theories again!!!
I love the way that Shane's brother explains theories. The video about the flat earth is one of my favorites because of him. I might not believe in those ideas, but the way he explains everything and lays out the information..... just beautiful
This video LITERALLY made my cheeks hurt from laughing so much. Thank you so much for coming back 🥲
His conspiracies are never actually conspiracies. The one on pizza at Chuck e cheese was ridiculous...
Yes! Love this. 😊
Been a good long minute since the last one. Well...time to get real comfy and  be amazed once again 🖤
Welcome back shane!!!
❤️❤️❤️
Hopefully it’s not a three part series videos where the first two videos have nothing to do with the conspiracy. Literal clickbait I feel at times.
"Before you know, you don't know"
I fucking love this lmfao
shane got a new shirt wow jskdjs
W
god i miss your videos. this just made me smile 😊😊❤️❤️
Just get a micro wedding planner. You have the perfect yard for a wedding.. then travel together
Y’all chuck E’s pizza really is bussin tho 😂😂 but nawh I loved this video 😍❤️
I never laughed so hard! Crying on the floor🤪
What if why the pizzas are fucked because the employees cut a piece for themselves and try to put the pizzas back together idk 🤷‍♀️
This is exactly what I wanted/needed! I laughed so hard I was actually tearing and my stomach hurts, from the O O O'Ryland to the Jamie Lynn Spears in Cancelled Anonymous!!! BTW the original Chuck E Cheese video is freakin ICONIC & this was a great follow-up!!
P is a abbreviation for paper (money) making the p 👌 loving seeing you both again can’t wait for more and so wish I was able to meet you and Ryan you too got me though so so much after my accident which left me paralysed waist down…. Please keep uploading please 😘xx
This MADE my day. Gonna watch this when I get home 😻
welcome back :)
I have genuinely laughed so much in a long time! 🤣
Honestly I think the pizza only looks like that cause the 16 year olds who work minimum wage aren’t good at making the dough round. 😂
Is Ryland doing surgery over there in the box!
Should have asked them not to cut the pizzas too see how they looked🤔🤨
SHANE THIS SHOULD BE THE FUNNIEST VIDEO U MADE
Shane… HUNTY!!! I love you and I’m so glad to see this notification ✨  You’re one of the few YouTubers who can make me choke on my tea laughing lmao, no but seriously thank you for blessing us with more content. I’m sending you my SuperLuv 😉😭❤️
Good to see you on this channel again, been watching and enjoying y'all on rylands channel. As a former pizza shop employee I'm gonna make a guess as to why the pizzas look uneven, the cutting board they use called a "peel" to cut the pizzas on then slide them into the box post cut. We did this at a pizza restaurant I worked at (Marco's Pizza) and it often looked similar. This causes the slices to jam into each other and look a little wonky. It makes for a faster cutting process and less damage to your cutting table tho I guess.
Oh my God you have to get courtney love on the podcast
I haven’t laughed this hard at classic YouTube in a long time. Thanks guys ✌️
Ugh, I loved this video! It was so fun! Missed you, Shane!
You look so happy
Shiiitt Nooooo fuckin way those 3 pizzas were $80
I thought they were cancelled? People love them again?
Loved it Shane! Don’t disappear again! We’re here for you! 💙
Conspiracy Videos Here We Go! Yes!
Shane, dahling, I have missed you! :) <3
Genius, love the comedy!
You HAVE to talk to Dan Cummins and go on his podcast!! He's all about the conspiracy theories!
Hey.. I missed you, you made my night thanks! 💙
NOT THE MARVEL ENDING HAHAH
Shane: gets demonetized Also Shane: now I can say Vagina freely   I would too tho so no shade
Yooooo Shane's alive!!!!!
🙂
Chuck E Cheese: Sues Shane.  Shane: FUCKKKKKL  Chuck E Cheese: Make a video praising us and showing the pizza isn’t different and we won’t seek legal action.    Shane: DONE!!!
I laughed soooo hard welcome back shane 🎉
Thank you for posting! Most of us missed you!
I swear lol if u get cancelled again for this lol
If you haven’t checked it out yet then everyone should take a look at Shane’s Daily Booth! I feel like most people who watch him on YouTube have no idea about that platform
MatPat over on food theory did a video on chuck e cheese and they told him the reason why chuck e cheeses pizza looks messed up is because of the cutter they use to cut the pizzas. It's one of those rocking blades and is completely dull for safety reasons so when they use it, it messes up the pizza and makes it look like Frankenstein's monster.
Omg. I'm so happy!! we made it!!! Lol please make more videos
I missed you so much
Shane, you mentioned a good point when you asked Chris, why are you so nice? and said something to the effect of childhood! It does for me! People here in Miami do not like me because I am to nice! Growing up in foster care! You are always justifying wanting to be loved & liked especially if you were mentally & physically abused as I was for 17 years until I ran away at 17.
I love this so much!!!! Loved everything about it!! We back babyyyyy!!! 🐷
SHANE you just made my day better by posting this thx so much I missed you so thx for making more videos
i want chuck e cheese now.....
Seriously though watch MatPat's video about the Chuck E Cheese pizza.
Idk why but I LOVED Ryan on this video.he just came  across so down to earth and genuine.  No looking at the camera nor making a vloger voice. Loved Shane's attitude also. He was glowing. More please.
When Shane said when he was growing up he didn't think he'd be there for 2022 I felt that... we really did make it :')
initially i did not like this video. it seemed like shane has been pushing this “i’m quirky🤪” vibe really hard after he was cancelled but maybe he’s just happier now, i was entertained this entire video so can’t really complain about anything just my two cents
Hilarious! :)
you’re back! :D
Girl apologize to Emma 😭😭
Glad to see shane post... Glad he seams to be makeing himself happier, But I wont lie.. Not even a little... Everytime, the upload notification, itsself, makes me miss jenna even more..  I respect her decision, but im always bummed I dnt think I'll ever see another random video from Jenna marbles..
SciFi/Supernatural based podcast, yes.
❤️
Thank you for the video 😭 made my week a lot better!!
(Launchpad looks at drake and blushes looking away) (drake notices this and reaches for his feathered hand and grabs it looking into launchpads eyes saying) "launchpad.."
Shane is to crack the 20.Millions mark, c'mon guys Subscribe to Shanes Channel  because he deserved it
18:58 yuuuup Shane, WE GET IT😅
🤣🤣
Im only 14 minutes in and I was crying at the TPE hahaha
😂 on the guest list! They all left 😂 😂 😂
I needed this
Yes yes
Get married in that tracksuit. Gucci baby.
Dead ass I think I know why the pizzas r messed up.
When I got this notification it brought me back to years ago when I would get a notification sitting in class EVERYDAY and couldn’t wait to get home to watch it even if it was flat ironing a Barbie 😂😂
✌️
He’s still trying to come back
Recommendation save my day again I didnt expect this (~‾▿‾)~
Love the vids Shane!! I’ve missed you, been a fan for a decade and honestly fuck these haters.. be YOU and upload what you want to upload. It’s your channel, not theres. Makes me super sad you getting anxious to upload cause of the hate feedback. We understand but the majority of us fans love you Shane and love what you upload. Be you and do what makes you happy/comfortable cause us true fans will be too.
can yall tell morgan we miss her
I hate it I’m vomiting right now
ADORED THIS VIDEO!!!!!!!! LAUGHED SO MUCH!!!!!!! missed you shane!

Hahahaha omg I need to include ryland’s insightful quote into my future coffee table book
KING IS BACK
You like girls and boys, except you like your girls to be infants
Shane’s ringtone was Ultra Super Elective Arena by Lil Creamy?
I'm so happy to see Shane being his carefree, confident, conspiracy-driven self again. Keep up the videos! Best wishes to you and Ryland with your future plans too :D
Ugh this video made me so happy to watch. I binged a bunch of Shane’s videos at the very start of the pandemic when work closed for me, and I was so sad when the videos stopped rolling in. So so so glad they’re back 💙
OMG I have missed laughing this hard with you Shane!!!!
So excited, you’re filming and feeling inspired again!! You inspired me to start filming my own things even though I hate being on camera, but editing is so much fun Idc that I hate my own voice! 😂
Low key think Cornie should be your first guest. The reunion would be epic.
I love Uno!
The name of your podcast should be named “Cancelled Anonymous with Shane Dawson”
Missed you shane!!
welcome back, Shane. New year, new beginning. Everyone deserves a new break.
Welcome back :)

9:33 I just blew coffee out my nose!😫😂
Shane!!!  I love this !!  I missed you :(( Wow, seeing your growth throughout all these years makes me feel old. You’re my childhood hero and still are!  I can’t wait for the podcast. ✨  Thank you for creating more content QUEEN !
Can we call him Crumbles Chris?!?! 🍪
I had to look twice 😍😍😍😍 I was having a horrible day but this changed it so fast! Thank you! So awesome !! :)
For me this guy will always be shanaynay lol... Back when YT content was what YouTube really was created for. Can't keep up with the current times but wish him more happiness and success.
I’m a fiend for these, any time shane uploads I feel like an addict finally getting a hit 😍
I'm so glad to see you healing Shane ❤ your videos are always the best to watch when I'm stoned af. Feels like I'm actually hanging with friends 🥲
aw shane so glad ur back to making videos again!! cant wait to see what else videos u have coming up!! and i think u doing a podcast idea would be soo cool; i would defently listen!! WELCOME BACK Shane!!
Wayy less ryland plz. Cant stand that kid. No idea what life is. Has a face you just wanna back hand.
I’m only 9 minutes into this video and I already have laughed more at this than any other video I’ve seen in months. I love Shane so much😭
Oh my God the podcast name should be Out of the Closet
This video was so wonderful! I was smiling and giggling the whole way through! I am so thankful you are making videos again ❤
Reading the comments to see if Emma comments
I can’t watch Shane while being stoned cause omg😭
OMG I haven't laughed this hard at one of your videos in awhile. So great!
So much dopamine was created in the viewing on this video, thank you 😊
I'm sure this has been said tons so far but I wonder if staff is removing tiny slivers of it to have as snacks and hoping it passes off as normal yknow. That's a safe reason ...riiight D:
I love seeing the actual Chuck E. Cheese i went to my entire childhood 😂😂 Woodland Hills still has an old and broke ass Chuck E. Cheese
The real lawsuit is Shane almost giving Ryland the O'Reily Auto Parts theme song. Lolz
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Just another person who really really missed this. Shane, you are reaching people just by being you and doing this video. It was my first smile of the day, thanks for the little escape. Keep going
I am a new subby😀
I literally need a conspiracy video ASAP!
AM K THE ONLY ONE THAT RESIZED Ryland is not living for the flirting and I’m DEAD
Get uncut pies brother
i love how your future is looking
Wut
I’m 4 mins in & I can’t stop laughing already 😂 god, I missed you 😭🤍🤍
I think Shane should have a podcast where he interviews people who have been canceled before and he could call it “canceled”. Shane if you read this, you can have it for free! 😋

I am so happy to see you on your own platform again! I have missed the Shane videos and finally you're back and happier than ever!
ew
I don't expected that at all but i had fun!.🤷‍♂️
:0 my master has returned
ugh still so obsessed you are back
Love you
im so drunk watching this
I get it 😏
The fact that they haven't provided a plausible explanation is the problem. They just need to show an uncut video of someone cutting a pizza and it ending up all wonky.
What the fucking fuck?? You spent 80$ on 3 pizzas??
#1 Youtuber of all time!
Bi diet root beer 😂
#3 trending not bad! So happy to have u back love your videos!!
Open the dannnmmm box 🤩🤩🤩 then 😮😮😮😨😨😬😬😬 somebody’s trash
I'm just all smiles and laughing the whole video! Thank u Shane! It's been to long!
SO SORRY TO THE STANS BUT IMO.... AS A WOMAN.. It’s SO CRINGE WITH them 3 sitting there talking about their experiences with vaginas... yuck
so the creep is back.....well done start acting positive and some more creepy shit will come out in the next few months that will probably scar more kids..
I know I shouldn’t like Shane this much, especially after everything, but he’s so funny 😭😭
Your wedding doesn't have to be big, just a small group of friends and family, a small ceremony in which you exchange vows.
Idk I found this hilarious! Old school shane is back 😂😂😂
Like I said! Keep enjoying the journey!! It gets even better Shane!
God I miss this Shane feel good to watch you again
Either the majority of people did a 180 or else these comments get monitored heavily.
The funniest video I’ve seen in a long time
what the fuck
so happy to see you back and happy shane!! all the love!!!!
i missed youuuuuuuuuuuu
Wait— is this notification a simulation?
Sesame street sponsoring the letter P 😂
I have missed these sort of videos from you!  You are hilarious!  Thank you for coming back!
I do shop goodwill on the daily. You would surprised what you find for high end brand names.  But if i EVER find your merch at a goodwill I willnever hesitate to buy it. I don't care. I love you! You're my queen
As a kid I’d go to the chucky e cheese ? In flint, Michigan lmaooo. Imagine that shit
Love you!!! Say Hi to Ryland for me!
“i’ve never ate one or put my finger in it” iconic
This wasn't what I was expecting today, but it was honestly what I needed😂 you're definitely gonna get sued, but that's okay because now you have pizza! All kidding aside, I'm really glad you're making content again and I can't wait for the next video❤️
I was having a horrible past couple of days, but this made everything so much better ❤️ thank you!
Loved this I miss you and hope that you will be doing more videos please
Shaaaaane....I've always thought you winked well lol. Loved this whole thing and boi I would Listen to your podcast for HOURS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Before hearing the spokesperson giving such stupid excuses, i would have said that they just always make several pizzas, some people order single slices, so the employees just always take away a slice from whatever pizza. And if you order a half-half, they just take the leftovers (but still in the kitchen, not from customers), like one pizza only has two slices left, you go to the next plate theres 3 more slices, and so on. Probably give it a quick reheat and done. You know, like those small pizza places that have those huges pizza on display and people buy single slices only (which is super weird to me… i also dont slice up an apple and share with others. Dont fucking touch my pizza)
I loved this!!
If you got a Chevy you wouldn’t be a republican 😔
Omfg I was JUST watching the chuck e cheese video
I just found out this weirdo is on the P3D0-spectrum.   Yikes
We need a chuck E cheese finale where Ryland gets a job at Chuck E cheese and find out how the pizza is made
omg chris is iconic
OMG! When Ryland responded, "Tight" with no hesitation & so confident, I lost it. Lol!
The fitttt 🤣🤣🤣👑🔥🔥🔥 P FOR SURE
It's been so good to see you on here!!
Chris crumble! Lol
Shane you need to marry ryland already lol just do a courthouse wedding and then if you want later do a vow renewal ceremony and make it more "traditional". So glad to see you back!! Love you guys!
How Shane literally calls ryland a fâg and no one gets offended.  Lol
love this. haven’t laughed that much in a while. 🖤🍕
Shane you look skinny 😳
Lmao still recycle I have a feeling but I’m at the part u zipping up the jacket 🤣🤣🤣🤣 wear the conspiracy jacket goo head queen 👑
I love Christopher Robin!  #podience
Oooo a smaller destination wedding sounds amazing 🤩 wearing soft things that you feel your best in...surrounded by love 💕
the chuckie 🔪👹🦠🤪
soo glad youre back shane, love you and your vids !!
I haven’t laughed this much since you and Jenna marbles left the internet and the pandemic hit. Thank you for this ❤️
"Putting your mouth on it or your fingers in it... seems really straight" Ryland 2022
@shanedawson you should share that experience spiritual fr
i asked someone i know that works at chuck e. cheese and he said it’s bc the blade on the cutter is dull then sent me a youtube video of someone talking ab it lol
Yessssss Queen 👑 get this podcast up and going I’m so excited 😆 love you and Ryland
This was so refreshing. I missed this!
Aaaaaaand i still don't believe I single word
Shane will always be hilarious 🤣
Is ryland insecure with you being bisexual
I feel like the whole 5 min talking about pu$$y cracked me up so much since the last month when I found out I had covid.
We missss you!!!!! Come back already!!!!!!
“P” in the UK means money. Example “oh I’m gonna make bare (loads) P at work today”.
M happy u r doing what makes you happy ❤️
23:25 please tell me this was mocking the old Jackie video 😭
SOOO GRATEFUL YOU’RE BACK ON YOUTUBE SHANE ❤️❤️❤️
uhhh i guess everyone’s voice got deeper… except for ryland 😭
Why don’t you just watch a video of the pizza being cut! And a lot of the photos you can see that it’s one pizza. One main photo looks like they put a half of a pepperoni (that went together) and a separate pizza that was cheese (that went together) then put them together and added one extra cheese piece that was from a completely different pizza.
I'm soooooooo fucking happy he's back I mean that there's his past but the dude has content I FUCKING LOVE YOU SHANE 🥰❤️
SHANE... I laughed (and "honked") so hard at this! We've missed you... can you also tell Jenna if you ever speak to her that I miss her so fucking much! Like... it's YouTube comeback time. Fuck cancel culture!
"Tight Pussy Energy" LMFAO!
Lmaooo that is not what 🅿️ means 😂😂😂 it’s a song !!! Look it up 😂😂😂😂
Thank you for coming back! You’re only cancelled if you allow yourself to be! Don’t give up!
If you look up how Chuck E. Cheese pizzas are made and cut on YouTube, you’ll go oh.. and understand lol. I’m like they need to change their dang cutter and stop using the giant two handle curved saw cutter.
Shame: You don't have stretch marks to Rylan... No. ME: Not yet, but, after he gets that vagina and has a baby he will. LMAO
Please interview me Shane! I love my elf on the shelf!
I felt like watching this, I was suffering from some sort of neurological disorder.   Nauseating.
I’m actually laughing out loud, this video was great and I’m so glad you’re back!
Love this Shane happy you're back ❤
Yay im so happy to get this notification!!! I'm so excited to see more videos!!!
I missed your videos so much! Love to see you and ryland so happy and full of joy, rylands vlogs are sooo good as well, I am all for it!

Are you in jeffrey not friends anymore and do not do make up anymore just wanted to know I’m not gonna unsubscribe if you don’t or if you’re not friends with Jeffrey just wanted to know so of the update I’m gonna rewatch your video from A year ago or so don’t know
Welcome king
#3 on trending and it makes my heart so happy ❤️
Yay nice to see you back again Shane! can't wait for more conspiracy videos soon, but also this type of content is so fun to watch too :) keep doing what YOU enjoy the most.
conspiracy theory: chucky cheese dug up old stuff about shane and ellen to cancel them and shut them up about pizza.
This video was too short. Can't wait for the next one.
Highlight of my month 😭💗🙌🏻
Señor pooh 😂😂
Never comment on videos and I laughed so hard at this one. I been a subscriber since day 1. Absolutely enjoyed this video. ;) 😉
This video is everthing I could've asked for, oh my god!!! The iconic Shane Dawson channel references + a reboot of the ChuckECheese lore was perfectly blended with announcements of exciting upcoming projects + natural moments of being unapologetically yourself. This video is Shane's best video since he's been back.
Oh Shane. It’s so good to have you back. This has the same energy as your old toys r us video and I absolutely loved every second. You have such a healing energy, this completely made my day.  Love you ❤️
I’ve missed you so much you make my day looking fabulous as ever love you♥️
Wait, Doesn’t 🅿️ stand for Pussy. I also wanted to say that I’m happy you’re back because I really miss seeing you and seeing new videos from you. You’re so Fucking amazing and please don’t ever forget that. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🍀🍀🍀🍀
Ok... As someone whom cooks lot and has worked in multiple restaurants, when cutting a pizza, the cheese easily moves with the knife which makes the pepperoni look unaligned and not even. When a pizza has homemade crust, some make it not a perfect circle on purpose because it looks more homemade. Which makes slices not look even when cut. This is my assumption and answer from what I've encountered.
O M G
Excited about the new theory vids
Shane & Riley = Every girls dream BFF!!! 😌😌 …& I don’t just mean cause we have vaginas 😂😂
shane, babe. this isn't helping your law suit 😭✋
Love this. best ending to a crappy day. i was watching this and having dinner and i said this is the best night ever! which seemed impossible...till  you posted ! :) <3
Not the urgent care right across the parking lot lmao
I'd imagine those who are still around aren't sensitive "woke" tweenagers, so just be yourself and don't care, we know you aren't some monster if we still watching so just embrace dark humor, I don't think I need to say when to draw the line as I'm sure you're much more familiar with that line now more than ever

I love seeing you come back to Youtube and can't wait to listen to your podcast!
3 1/2 minutes in and Jesus Christ I missed the chaos 😍👌🏻
You always make me 😂
You should do a video with trailer trash tammy!!
Also while I was watching your videos I’m laughing the whole time and my fiancé comes in and was like “why are you laughing so much did Shane Dawson finally post another video” lol he knows
I loved this I laughed so much. I’ll be honest I e been hesitant to watch since the cancellation but after watching this video I remember how much I loved Shane in the food video/pre cancellation era, I used to watch every video. I missed that energy and this was a refreshing nostalgic video for me ❤️❤️❤️ much love and I hope to see more content like this 😁
I really enjoyed the format of this videos and found my self constantly laughing at the jokes. glad you’re back shane :)
wasn't expecting this for my birthday lmaoo
Literally laughed so many times from this video!!❤️😂😂 so so so so happy to see you back! I love your videos ❤️❤️
Omg this made my crappy day so much better I could not laughing and your smile is so contagious that my cheeks hurt
Ahhh I’m so happy you posted I literally started crying(possibly could be the pregnancy hormones) I love this types of videos please post more love you
the fact that there is an urgent care in the same plaza as a Chuck e Cheese is honestly so funny to me
The rylan twerking moment in the elf outfit 🤣
So so glad to see you! I hope this is just the beginning! Welcome back Shane!
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Just another person who really really missed this. Shane, you are reaching people just by being you and doing this video. It was my first smile of the day, thanks for the little escape. Keep going
“A MIX” LMFAAAOOOOOOOO
Soooo yes I want a shane dawson podcast… when I searched for it, all that came up was rylands (which I’m subscribed to) and a podcast titled “friends without benefits, not to deep”) 😂   Yes Shane.. podcast it up… please
Love it!!
I've never laughed so hard at a video! missed this Shane!!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️😂😂😂
Omg yes your podcast used to be my favorite!! So excited
So happy you’re back :’)  honestly it doesn’t matter what content you post just getting that notification gives me something to look forward to watching. WE MISSED YOU
I must say I didn’t realize how much I missed Shane’s videos as much as I did but I feel much happier now knowing Iv got someone to watch at lunch to make me feel surrounded by friends 🤗❤️
SHANE, we voted for an hour!!!!! 🤪
If a podcast is happening we NEED Jessie Buttafuoco back!!
Hey Shane iv been watching you forever and I love every single video you've done....I'm pissed af that people were trying to cancel you.....I have a song that has lyrics that relate to you I want you to listen to it and if you could please do a reaction video while watching it I know it might not be your type of music but it will surprise you zombified by falling in reverse
Is Ryland high in this ???
Do a podcast pls
Shane I love you so much it's so nice to watch your videos again. My brother took his life in September and life hasn't felt the same and seeing your videos just brings me back to childhood. Your videos make me feel light. Thank you for posting again
Talking about the conspiracy pallet. Are you and Jeffree still good?
Lmaoo I really missed Shane! I cannot stop laughing
Being in Ottawa, that begining truck scene was scary real right now, lol.
Just got done crying over my rude a$$ boyfriend.. 3 minutes in, I’m already laughing. Ugh thank u Shane. ❤️
I never thought I would see 2000 . I get it .
I’m dying. This is so funny.
I want that visor
I was laughing so hard this entire video! I love these random videos you make! You are hilarious shane! Love seeing you this happy! Please don't ever stop making these kind of videos..they just show the real you and ryland and it is great and wholesome to watch! Love seeing you happy again!
This was so genuinely funny and pure. Made my night. Keep it up Shane! ❤️
Did Ryan really just say three pizzas were EIGHTY DOLLARS?!?!
This video had me ROLLING 😂😅🤣 I ❤️ you guys
I think what there doing with their pizza is making them as wholes like whole pepperoni, whole cheese, etc so when you order a pizza that's half pepperoni and half cheese their actually taking half from 1 of the whole pepperoni pizzas & half from 1 of the whole cheese pizzas & combining them. I honestly don't know but itt sounds plausible & makes the most sense. I think if they were truly recycling food any ex-employee that was fired would've been all over it
I’m dying laughing, I missed you so much
i laughed so much at this. this is what we want
I’m happy with any content you post! 😊
I missed these videos so fricken much 😭
So happy and excited that your making videos again it's so nice to see your face and hear your voice again can't wait to see what's coming! Also your merch is amazing I have atleast 4 hoodies and your makeup pallets gave me a reason to wear eyeshadow and explore something new as a person who never wears makeup I absolutely love it!
I'm wondering if shane is still working on that movie? 🤔
lets be honest here They are recycling their pizzas and there is nothing Shane can do about it other than let us know
You need to interview Elizabeth April & talk to her about her Alien encounters!!!
Was not expecting a whole video about Chuck E. Cheese pizza…but glad Shane is back!!
I get it Shane didn’t think I’d make it to 2022 didn’t think I’d make it past 2018 tbh with ya. glad you’re back
Couldn't love this more. Was hilarious 😂☠
Oh how I’ve missed this
I love the Marvel/Iron Man image hahaha XD
Gonna be watching more videos been waiting for you to come back to YouTube
34:00 they’re sisters not twins
you're back baby!!
We have more than five senses.
chuck e. cheese pizza looks like little ceasers
I would definitely listen to your podcast bro!
Cats be like 😭
Who is this fantastic witty confident Shane? This is everything.
Is no one else screaming just watch matpats video on food theory?!? 🤣🤣🤣
yes!!!!!!!!!
Maybe it’s like IKEA and the pizzas are sent in pieces to later be poorly assembled.  Chuck should never allow 2 pieces of pizza to appear on the same plate.
Can't wait to see more Conspiracy videos, Shane!
I’m so glad your doing well and seeing you happy 😊 hope to see more videos we love you shane,Ryland,Chris.
Have always loved Shane. Glad you’re back! ♥️
shane you have to post more, i have anxiety myself, and watching your videos helps me with my anxiety, you all are so funny❤️
Channel your energy into a cringefest video with satirical laughter from chrisy- seriously? You succeeded and shown us you’ve learnt nothing.
😵‍💫
Welcome to the Marvel family Shane ❤️
I missed this so much lol super looking forward to a new podcast and (most importantly), CONSPIRACY THEORY VIDEOS! 🤩 also, I’ll say it so you don’t have to get sued: CHUCKY IS FULL OF SHIT 😂
A podcast but not with lizzie please
It's so wonderful to have you back. I love you, Shane! I'll always be a fan! :D Cannot WAIT for the podcast!
i definitely miss the old conspiracy video’s
Omg this kind of content where you guys talk is actually peak i loved it!! So funny feels like y’all are just chatting and you guys are funny so it works 👍🏼
Wtf
Shane always looks like an unmade bed.
Funny I was thinking abt Shane today and I didn’t know this was uploading
SHANE PLEASE DO A PODCAST I WOULD LOVE IT
Shane, you need help. Please get it. I hope the best for you and Ryland.
Ha ha 😂 I love the answer at 0:45! It was like, yeh fuck it why not.
Shaaane so happy to see you! Thx for popping up again! Kkk
This is the video I needed from u Shane I'm so happy your back😭🥺😍
Omggg this is giving old shane and im here for it
I was so excited for Shane's comeback but Ryland doing all that shady shit sorta ruined that for me.
I have watched Shane for years and love him and Ryland but... I don't see them interact with eachother and think "these two are in love" I see them and think "these two are good friends." I know being in a relationship is different for everyone, and my own experiences don't dictate what someone else goes through, but I just don't see romantic love when I look at them together.   I see platonic connection. There might be a reason why Shane hasn't married Ryland yet and it just might be because deep down he just doesn't want to and thats fine. Ryland is very insecure about their relationship anyway. Just about every video he is in he voices his insecurities and worries that Shane will leave him. You should never feel this insecure in a commited relationship with someone you're allegedly going to marry.  I want the best for both of them and hope it works out but I hope that if it doesn't no one gets hurt.
pig
Order one , but ask them not to cut it up, buy a pizza cutter .. bring it home and cut it yourself and see how that goes. For science
Do bisexual people only date other bisexual people or do they date gay people too? It’s a stupid question I know
I absolutely love you 😘

Pigs are very determined, intelligent creatures. They might be your spirit animal!
I loved every second of this content. Missed you so much ❤️
As a former event and wedding planner (in CO...hi neighbor)), your wedding should be a reflection of the both of you and your life together. Family and friends will have A LOT of comments and their ideas for you, but it's essentially worship Shane and Ryland Day and you guys should have things the way you want. If your ideal is a small intimate gathering or a big ass ballroom wedding, you do you. Also, don't pay more than 10% of your budget on a planner/consultant and never put yourself in debt for a wedding. I'm thrilled to see you post and I hope we see more from you. 💜
Yay!!! Welcome back Shane Dawson! Love you.
I'm glad to see you doing what you love ♥️
I'm so glad to see you back :) you looked genuinely happy in this and it honestly made me emotional
Cried laughing at the pizza reveal 😂 glad you’re back Shane!
I laughed so damn hard.  Pure magic thanks to the rat.  U guys are so entertaining
I was convinced all my life I would die at 25 and I'm going onto 27 and I'm still confused why I'm here - but honestly because of the pandemic it has felt like a huge part of me has died, I lost so much... So I'm gonna say my intuition was just on point. I DID die, just not literally. It's a small death.
Your conspiracy videos were the videos I looked forward to. I would get so freaking excited to see you post a conspiracy video. They were just done so well and I would be so happy to have those back.
Shane is so hilarious!! Love him for that :)
The one and only time I ever went to check e cheese my entire family as well as the family we were with got violently Ill the day after we went 😂 👀
Great video Shane! Glad to see you have a new happier outlook on life and are creating again. Been watching since 2010
PUSHIN 🅿️ PUSHIN 🅿️PUSHIN 🅿️PUSHIN 🅿️
i missed you so much.
I laughed so often and so damn hard during this video. Thanks for all the dopamine!
if i am a character and someone’s playing me can they maybe do a little better of a job that’d be great
seeing shane so happy literally warms up my heart so much!!! keep up the good work shane! ❤️
u were deeply missed
Hola soy Dora
People actually find this content interesting and funny?
Omg pleeeease do the podcast! I still listen to the old ones… the ones that haven’t been scrubbed from the internet anyway 😭
Funniest fkn video 😂 I haven't laughed like this in ages lmfao
You should do a podcast! I’d listen
I'm Soo insanely happy Shane is back. And excited for all his new content because for me YouTube was dull without him. Love you Shane ❤️
What if they cut the pizza badly voluntarily, and then misplace the bits from the same pizza but on the other half, just to keep the mystery alive?
3 minutes in and I’m already snorting
Yay he is back
Haven't laughed this much in a while! Please post more videos!
Welcome back😁
I FUCKING LOVE YOU ❤️
The ongoing conversation of Rylands metaphorical vagina is everything I didn’t know I needed.
Shane is soo confused about politics. Really.  He believes in republican based conspiracy theories,  and says so many republican things he doesn't even realize,  but claims he's democrat. Lol I think LA confused him with this. 😬 btw, being a republican is not a bad thing.  At all.
I get it and p.s I ended up getting COVID too
I can’t believe how much I caught myself smiling during this video.
Found out my Lil sister has liver failure,she's only 29. I needed this more than you'll ever know. Thank you,sir(s)! Ur timing couldn't have been more perfect. Haven't laughed this hard in awhile. Keep doin you,boo boo! Cya next video 🖤🖤🖤
Ahhh Shane is back! So happy to see it. You had me cry laughing.
Omggggg love u shane ❤️❤️❤️
Omg!!! So hilarious about why they use a Rat for the mascot at Chuck E. cheese. 😂 “Because Rats like trash”! 🐀 🧀
I remembered Rylands song y’all did 😂😂
ask if you can get the pizzas uncut
Hi Shane, I’m wondering if you’d talk more about how you reconcile your belief in Jesus with believing in psychics. I think it’d be interesting because I know your mom loves Jesus and you grew up religious. I’m not trying to be rude, just curious to hear that story. Thanks!
HELL YES SHANE
You had me laughing SO HARD 😂😂😂😂😂 OMG.....awesome having you back!!!❤
Shane finding a way to blame his behavior on someone who controls him as a conspiracy 🙃 gurl bye
Hey Shane, your house/walls kinda  cried when you  started to have  plumbing issues when you and Ryland moved to Colorado ☺
I LAUGHED the entire video. You and Rylands humor is so much like me and my boyfriends, we die the whole time watching you guys. Loved the video and so glad your back. ❤️
Shane, rock on!!! cool video. Glad you are in the mood to film again.  I would love to see you microwave a few barbies lol.
I missed you shane, please keep making videos
Welcome back 😊
I'm only 11 min in so far and of course Shane is hilarious I'm laughing BUT there is also some tension between him and Ryland that keeps making me back up O_O like daaamn almost as if hes annoyed that Ryland is trying to be in the vlog being a tad bit savage with the jokes and turning away from him when he speaks, changing the subjects and you can see it on Rylands face that hes bothered then he plays it off. Shane continues the vlog and laughing away with Chris then Ryland joins in then Shane goes back to rolling his eyes and kind of tuning him out/changing the subject. Definitely getting that "Rylands the new kid in school and Shane is the popular one joking with the friends trying to avoid him" a little awkward maybe there's some tension bts idk
I mean hey, some of us with 'gifts' aren't all that bad. XD Awesome video. <3
How is this the funniest video anyone has put on Youtube in years?
Literally made my day to see this on my subscription feed!!!! Ahhh I’m just so excited to see more!!! I absolutely can not wait! Woot woot!
i’m so glad shane’s back on youtube. you’ve been my favourite for over 10 years.
yes!! i love you shane. you’re podcast sounds amazing because I would love interviews with conspiracy theorists or other interesting things etc etc 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻😍😍😍😍
i love how in the background u can see that the chuck e. cheese is next to an urgent care.
I love this so MUCH! This is the gay chaos i needed today
So glad to see that your mental health is improving, we’ve missed you so much❤️ I love the conspiracy videos, but this was a nice intro to your new self! You have all my support Shane!
this is probably my favourite youtube video i’ve seen in a long time, this is incredibly funny and i literally couldn’t stop watching
I love a simple life
Omg I so missed your videos!!! The doctors think I might have cancer I find out on the 3rd of March and I so needed the laughs!! Please keep posting love from Arkansas
Can we have more videos like this. Cause this made my day!
YESSSSSSSSS IM SO READY
i woke up to this notification and thought to myself that i was going crazy but hell yeeeesss hes baaaack‼🤩also we need more conspiracy videos!!!!!🕵🕵‍♂🕵‍♀
Ohhh I love you so much ✨🖤 you look so happy and different. Just keep being you, do whatever content you want and don’t give a fuck about anything negative
Coming from someone who worked at a pizza place for years, the reason behind why those slices do not match up is complete bs lol that’s not a real thing! They just need to own up to it at this point.
YOUR NUMBER 3 ON TRENDING
i’m here for shane’s comeback
Shane!!!! I loved everything about this, my hubby and I were cracking up along the whole ride! Love you!!
I literally did give my Shane Dawson merch to goodwill
I missed you
I paused the video at the cheese pizza to see if the cutting lines would match up.. they don’t. How does that work…..
Quote of the year “before you know you don’t know” ~ryland
Shane <3
The "we're in a simulation" opener.... Eye roll!!!
Welcome back! I missed you!!
Very happy to see you Shane, I have been watching you since 2011!! And I'm proud to still be a fan 11 years later❤
YASSSS QUEENN pop off start a new podcast I love you Shane omggggg ✨✨✨
I missed your humor Shane! Loved that your back, kinda. Hahaha.. because you will most likely go away for sometime again.. haha
I’ve missed Shane. ❤️
this was HILARIOUS 😂 i loved this so much. Made my bad day better!
Couldn’t stop laughing…so happy to see you back and creating videos again!
Look at Shane getting inspired again! I stan!!!
OMG! LMAO! 🤣😂😂😂😂 Great video

I havent laughed this hard in a long ass time! I missed shane so much
who's the new cameraman?
Deliciously diverse
I hadnt realised I missed this
Wedding idea: You, Ryland, and  immediate family overlooking the Colorado mountains at sunset.
missed you dearly ❤
I've missed this so much! Thank you Shane!
I missed you king ❤️
I CACKLED when they opened that first pizza box
Maybe they cook numerous pizzas... then slice them....and maybe they transport them after slicing them...and they end up with multiple pizzas put together....am I making any sense at all? lol
Love Chuck e cheese!! I don't even care... mmm

Yasssss 🧡🧡 conspiracy videos 🧡 you are the best
every midwestern when the oriley ad came on - OH OH OH O-RILEY AUTOPARTS OW!
This put a smile on my face☺️
18:40 literally same
So. My 2022 has not started out the best. At all. In fact, it has sucked. But seeing Shane post again and getting a podcast started just gave me hope that 2022 can only get better from here. Thank you for being you 🖤🅿️
Yes, podcast, YES
This was the most fun ever
señor pooh
Ya'll really acting like nothing happened eh??
Bi....cycle, Biden 🤣
THANK GODDDDD WE FINALLY HAVE A NEW VIDEO
Yyyyaaaass !! So good to have you back!! Love the videos!
Would love conspiracy theories again
The kids are so brainwash have you guys forgot what he has done
Shane, you are amazing DONT let anyone tell you you are less then
Ask to get the pies uncut next time. Gamechanger! lol
OMG PLSSS bring pack your food videos. I loved them so much 😭😭😭😭
I'm dying laughing at this conversation in the beginning 🤣 😂
Yessssss💕💕💕💕💕
I've been trying to get Mr beast to do a video "finding the flat earth"  end the debate once and for all. He can get the funding to buy a drone to fly to the edge 🤣
Riden dirty in my truck
I LOVE YOU ❤️
Hilarious. 😂😂 I will say. I used to work at a Cici's pizza and sometimes when we had half and half pizza orders. Instead of making one pizza, we'd make both then put the 2 halfs together, and sometimes the crusts wouldn't line up. 😂🤷‍♀️
I miss you burning babies and playing with weird stuff!!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ new year new you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
“You don’t want to see this” umm yes, yes i do! This is everything I needed!
I love this and the outfits your wore to chucke cheese!! Please never never stop posting again!!! 🤣🤣🤣
This was a breath of fresh air. Missed you!
What most people don’t realize is when you transfer the pizza from the cutting board to the pizza box, it will look lopsided and weird if you weren’t used to the motion of it.  My first job was Pizza Hut and I sucked ass when they put me on the cut table. Uneven slices and weird placement in the box.
I haven’t laughed this hard is so long ! I loved this whole video it’s just like old times. Love you Shane ! 🤍 Glad your back!
The fact that you’re happy and posting again means so much to me and so many other out there who love and support you! So glad you are back, please don’t ever leave
Daily uploads for nonlegal purposes are great too!
Shane omg!! 😭 i missed these so much
Ryland that's not what the P stand for 🤣🤣
Thank you for the laughs 😁😁😁
Skits to be clear!!! Real Shame fans never cancelled him. It was the haters that love digging the past and make people feel bad and don’t let them grow… we were always here for Shane
Almost gets sued for Chuck E Cheese pizza conspiracy 4?? Years ago??  Makes another video calling out Chuck E Cheese pizza conspiracy  But its fineeeee….they’re FRIENDS✨   🤣🤣  I loved how chaotic this is. Straight up How I imagine your every day life.
Chuck e cheese is a disgusting place and tons of kids leave there with Hand Foot and Mouth disease
You are so needed on this earth 🌍💜🌍💕
Missed Shane’s videos can’t wait for more!! Shane is literally a vibe I love him
Omg I missed these videos so much!!
Before you know you don't know. The more you know
Welcome back! We missed you! 💐 Also please more merch 👏🏻🐷
Shane so happy to see you posting videos again
SO STOKED FOR THIS 😻
I miss the conspiracy videos!!!
Shane doesn't even need a conspiracy video to make me spiral into thinking nothing is real
Seriously can't get enough of your videos you are freaking hilarious sitting on my couch laughing 😂
Shane, you have lost so much weight! You look great!!
So happy to see you upload again
I was about to go to bed, but naw
I mean, could we just ask them to not cut the pizza before giving it to us??
This was hilarious 😂 ❤️
These leftoid white saviors are so embarrassing. L
Can you pls make conspiracy videos like u used to
I missed you 😭🤍
SHAAAAAANE❤️ Welcome back and glad to see you getting happier with yourself and what you want to do next. Can't wait to listen to your podcast 😁💗
🅿️ shane’s pushin p
Your podcast would smother Rylands… like…half the audience watches to get updates on you.
So the person playing my game has me staying in bed all day eating bags of chips? Is this a sick joke? lmao!
I think Ryland put together and uploaded  a video Shane intended as a parody and now in Rylands next vlog we will see Shanes reaction.
Omg had me dying here at work 😭🤣 “ we made it Chuck E”  lmao Love you Shane ❤️💕
Ok i like this shane lol.. Never watched him before but this shane is hilarious
can you just make a horror movie already
Okay but if they wanted to vindicate themselves it would be easy. All of their pizzas turn out this way so they just need to record themselves making it and and show that it turns out different sizes. Since they haven’t done that even with all the scrutiny they are under, I would think it’s because they can’t 😬
I went to my local thrift store and there was a Shane's merch in the woman's section
Omg this made my day, Lol thank you shane.
Please document the process of getting back to  yourself and getting the podcast going. We love your journey 💕
I love that you're not hiding your sense of humor despite people's judgement👏👏👏
you guys talked about chamberlain coffee so much , even if  it was in the context of tight vajayjays, that you really should get paid for it lol .
Thank you so much Shane! That was so fun 🤩
Please bring back the food videos, they were so much fun!
Any porn on your podcast would be a HUGE MISTAKE IMO
i wish the camera guy would be himself, it feels like the laughing is forced and it’s distracting
i love this video so much, it just felt nice and casual and fun like were all hanging out! ive been watching your vids since like 2011 and im rly proud of how far youve come, even if this is just a fun and silly video. ily shane and im glad that youre back ❤️
Always so 🤣 Shane I miss you bro
Now we just need Jenna Marbles back and all will be well.
the new strain is CHUCKY-19
I'm so happy you're finally back, I'm jumping up and down 🤪 I have missed you!! Don't ever let anyone affect you again.
Yesss u gotta do more conspiracy theory videos and food videos
can i just say i missed laughing as much as i do when i watch your videos.
WOOOOHOOOOOOO!!!!
Awkward moment… “it’s in the beans” lmao Shane is just so naturally funny. 😂
Lmao Shane dragging his feet on getting married is like how my husband was during our engagement. He proposed but then dragged his feet for 4 years when it came to booking a date. I eventually just booked an appointment at a venue, made him go, and told him we’re getting married on 9/14.  We’re coming up on 8 years of marriage now and he’s said multiple times now he doesn’t know why he dragged his feet for so long. He was nervous of getting married and having everyone staring at him..but we ended up having a tornado during our ceremony and everyone had to run for cover.. so the jitters quickly dissolved once that happened 😂
NUMBER 3 ON TRENDING💪💪
This was fun^^
shane is pushing 🅿️
so did u block negative comments?? im a little confused on this comment section
I’m sorry I lost it at “ senior Pooh “ we missed you Shane :)
This video has me in tears 😂😂😂😂that pizza still fucked up👀

Omg I needed this today
watch food theory
UFOS are a HUGE WASTE OF TIME
And Shane thought this was going to be boring no sir I missed you and I’m so happy that your having fun again making whatever you want love ya and hope the videos keep coming excited to see what’s to come
The chucky cheese pizza is killing all the things you guys say is just hilarious 😂😂 their pizza is fucked up I agree
I love you SHANE!!!!!! 2022!!!!!
I stan u Shane so much!!! So happy your back! 💛💛💛💛
Yes yes YES to the podcast !!!!!! ♥️💜♥️
I believe we’re in simulation too. Think of those birds falling from the sky recently!
I’m dying at the IT joke! Ugh i missed you so much. Your so funny!
Wait 80$ for 3 Chuck E. Cheese pizzas?? Ughhh.....😂😂😂
i love how shane just goes along w the fact that he knows so many people hate him hahaha that’s why i’ve always loved him.
TPE!! I WOULD WEAR IT!
I know what he did was wrong however i still miss him and his content hopefully this will bring out the new better Shane. Edit: I later watched everything he’s done he’s a literary monster
Turn the pizza over and check the crust pattern and see if it lines up
And after this video and all the talk of women’s vaginas and everything else you need to marry ryland like yesterday LOL for real!
Chuckie cheese pizza is a mash up and so were your outfits 😂
Yes, bring the podcast back!
With the pizza conspiracy at least with the half and half pizza, as someone who works in food (not at Chuck e cheese) we're not allowed to put pepperonis on cheese pizza and cook it for a half and half pizza, you have to make one whole cheese and one whole pepperoni and then take half of each pizza for a half and half pizza which is why half and half pizzas often look wacky .
Love you and love your content but I feel like the detailed sex talks aren’t necessary to any videos you make and it kind of just makes it feel uncomfortable. I understand humour may be a coping mechanism as it is for me too, but you could just cut it out.
We have all missed you and your hilarious videos so much!!! Hearing your laughter was the BEST part of my day. Love you Shane!
I need a tpe shirt
I’m so glad you’re back! You’ve always made life just a little easier! 💕
Right as the video starts...     Me: "Huh?"
I needed this in my life 😂😩💚
ID KILL FOR A PODCAST
Shane. 🥺🖤
Poor ryland just wants a slice of pepperoni and u two keep talking LOL. There’s no way it is used pizza. I actually thought maybe when they use the pizzas they had out being used for slices when people order just a slice. And when they get a pizza order they use those slices first so it isn’t sitting out. Lol 😂 that would make sense as to why they don’t add up to a circle. But seriously if they don’t put the dough spread out in a circle before cooking it then it won’t be a circle when they cut it. So that would be why some slices look like they are longer than the others.
Thank you. ❤
I legitimately laughed the whole time
Oh my gosh I laughed so much! Still a super fan!!
I cannot wait for more videos. I am so HAPPY you are back. Bring on the content Shane. I can only binge watch old videos so many times lol. And a podcast too!!! I cannot wait. WE LOVE YOU SHANE. Screw the haters. You kept saying this video wasn't what we wanted, think again. This is EXACTLY what we wanted. Shane back and better than ever.
Yes yes do a podcast !!! We would love it 🥰
I hope there’s more Shane and Eugenia videos. 💖
Shane. I love you and baby I miss the hell outta of you. But. Ummm. STOP😭 playing with Ryland. Lol. It’s he’s facial expression for me!! 🤣🤣. Marry that man Already. ❤️❤️❤️.
Ive always stuck with you and loved/love your videos. You are my favorite youtuber and always will be. Keep being you because thats what makes you special. Love you Shane :)
30 seconds in and it feels like home XD
Didn’t realize how much I needed this video. I’ve watched Shane for years and this is what I needed.
🥲
Seriously,  I thought there was something wrong with my YouTube.  Is this really Shane Dawson??
Hilarious stuff. Looking forward to watching you do small dumb ass adventures. ((:
Hahahaha I've had the WORST few days and I did need this  I really needed this. Thankyou. Plz keep em coming. The videos..... not the dreams? 🤣🤷‍♀️ 💯❤✌🇦🇺
I’m sorry 80 DOLLARS??? On three pizzas?? Girl..
Love you
the disclaimer edit killed me lmao
I miss you so much please post more videos 😊
You should interview Lana Rhodes!  I think her story is so interesting and she recently just moved away from LA too while pregnant  It’d be so cool to hear her journey and her plans and how her life has changed etc
Yayyyyyyyyyy HI SHANE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ngl, was surprised to see shane in a F-150, particularly one that dirty.
Thank you for this video 🥺😭😭
UM DID I JUST GET ON YOUTUBE TO SEE A NEW SHANE UPLOADDD . I am a very happy girl right now
So glad you are back Shane. I have missed you buddy
Love this. Lol the Chuck E. Cheese conspiracy was the funniest and I love that he did a follow up on this years later.
The people making it probably don’t put the dough in a circle before cooking it. So it isn’t a circle shape it comes out probably all weirdly shaped. And when they fuck up cutting it they probably throw out slivers of it so it’s missing some slivers off of it.
Oh no. We LOVE the Chuck E. Cheese content lol. You should know that Shane come on!!! 😂😂
This is everything I needed today, this week, this month, and this year. Thank you.
all the girls about to start buying emmas coffee
chuck. e: THIS IS THE SECOND TIME SHANE!! 💀
“[Colorado] made me a Republican” if you were smart……. 😀😁
HES SO HAPPPY
This video has me dying 🤣 and I'm only 10 mins in.
Yasssssss!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️
I rly loved this (keep the carefree content coming)
I very  rarely comment on videos but omg I was laughing out loud the entire time. Good old fashion humour. Love it
ive never had a chuck e. cheese pizza before 🤣
i 100% enjoyed watching this! I missed this kind of comedy. I really, really was so into Shane's vlogs from wayyyyy back. This is giving me that kind of vibes.
I love this! Definitely needed a video from you today♥️ Please Shane keep making videos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuJujvgFTpI Bro😳
I haven’t laughed this much in years! 😂 Shane you’re so naturally funny. All the puns and everything got me dead. And your self awareness.
YESSS I LOVE UR IDEAS ESPECIALLY THE CONSPIRACY THEORIE IDEA
I missed this notification so much!
It’s cheeses? Since when
My favourite person ever ❤️🥰
“I’m republican now… I’m just kidding” “Now take off that mask” 😂😂😂
Ryland, just start planning the wedding. Begin with making appointments with planners in CO and then it will start rolling and a date will soon be set. You really should have your wedding and reception in your backyard and you really need to hire the food trucks that you stop at all of the time for the “after party”. It would be iconic if you gave out Cumble cookies as favors.
EXACTLY what I wanted!
Maybe that's why he's a rat cause rats eat trash. Hahahaha I'm dying. Missed you guys !!
YouTube always trends the biggest trash.
OK ... why did I like Ryland's outfit it felt the 🅿️ for me ?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 is this how I find out my true nature at the young age of 32
Some people don't have a "voice in their head" what does that mean?
We don’t care what you post… we came for the content, we stayed for YOU. ❤️
PLS MAKE THE LITTLE DEBBIE ICECREAM REVIEW VIDEO!!!!
Omg I loved this video
So happy your back, your videos keep me laughing even during my hard times. Missed this !!❤️
i was actually dying laughing while watching this video it’s too good
Yet again I am here asking for more content with or from your brother. I love his brain, and his humor is 💯 Bonus points because he is cute…
80 dollars for THREEE pizzas?!!! In WHAT world. Holy shit
just have a wedding, ooo or elope that would make a good video
Omg so exited to have u back!!!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️
*I missed Shane🥺🥰💕*
Couldn’t be more straight and I’ve always watched your videos 🤣but btw I fucking love marvel!!
keep them coming shane!!
Omg!  my fav content creature is back. I must have died and gone to heaven❤️❤️❤️ I have missed you Shane
When I've watched this 3 times now because I've just missed it so much
I loved it! Its like getting to just hang out with you all. Btw, a small wedding is better then a big production. My husband and I decided on a wedding that was done at a chapel in Eureka Springs Arkansas. It was a all in one kind of deal. But because we had to travel, we didnt want to put everyone we knew through it. We had immediate family only. Then after the honeymoon, we hosted a party at our house that everyone came to, and shared the video. It was all low key and little stress. Please do consider something small. Its worth it. Because your marriage is about just you two. Not everyone else.
I would totally be into a podcast, really looking forward for it!
This video was soooo fucking hilarious lmfao love it
This is the best birthday gift I could ever get Shane Dawson posting
PUSHIN 🅿️izza
please stay!!! we need you! we miss you! we love you!!!!!
I about CRIED when I got this notification! Ahhhh you’re back 😭❤️
Trending!!!

I miss Cheeto

YAY, I love that you are back Shane😄. You give the internet life. love you guys.
It was pretty damn adorable when Ryland said yall were going to be married by common law, like ha! Too cute:)
Yesssss keep the videos coming Shane 🙌🏻 my husband and I love snuggling on the couch watching them
when she said traditional or stuffed ? shane: mixed😂😂😂😂
Rylands cracking me up lol
Why is it only 43.22 minutes? :(
🤣🤣🤣
Yesssssss Shane is back, so need this in my lifeeeeeeeee
I love Ryland just going to town on this pizza 😂😂😂
Jumbo jumbo vajina
Still a pathetic waste of space, no sympathy
I love the fact he sent this to his lawyer. The first 5 mins was something I would never send to a lawyer 😂😂
Let's get you in that suit hahahaha ryland
I missed you Shane! I had a smile throughout the whole video.
😂
Sending SO much love from Hawaii Shane❤️ I’ve always been a fan and looking forward to you videos every week gave me something to look forward too🥺❤️
I haven’t laughed this hard from a video in awhile! Hope Chuck E Cheese doesn’t try to sue him again after this video 😅😂. Keep up the great work Shane.
AHHH LOVE THIS
Chuckie said reuse, reduce, and recycle.
Please name the new podcast Hookers and Aliens.... Because why tf not
I like the truck. I like the attitude and I like how your doing from what i see dude.
Been a fan since the beginning -so happy to see you back making videos! Hope they keep coming! Missed you Shane!
IM SO GLAD YOUR BACK!!!!!!
SHANE! SHANE! SHANE! SHANE!
Shane trying crumbl video!
Fun fact Shane I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of a little in the game called five nights at Freddy’s but in its most recent installment security breach there is a reference to this Chuck E. Cheese theory  also to answer Chris’s question the main explanation that I saw from ex-employees was they use a special pizza cutter like you know how the pizza cutter at home you have it kind of wheels back-and-forth they don’t have that they have one that kind of rocks back and forth like a rocking chair when you cut it so they said that’s why it’s not like perfectly symmetrical
Omg omg I just noticed it’s #3 on trending 😱😱😱
i often think about the effect of being "cancelled" online by millions of people who are commenting for you to kill yourself, specifically for people who have video content of themselves talking for years. Everyone makes mistakes- if you don't support then stop watching- spreading hateful comments is not okay. these r my high thoughts open to discuss lol
MORE MORE MORE GIVE US MORE
I laughed so hard watching this… like legit tears . It’s so good to see Shane so happy.   Shane if you read this please don’t leave your fans hanging again- it’s one thing if you need time for mental health but don’t stay away because people want to “cancel“ you or any of that bullshit. Fuck those people, your fans love your content and who cares about the rest. I’m a stay at home mom and my days are so stressful and you just made my day. I was straight up laughing out loud so many times, like the entire video - you are a true comedian , naturally. You don’t even have to do anything, you just naturally are hilarious with your comments, facial expressions or hand gestures etc. You have a natural ability, it sounds stupid but you are helping people, you are helping me. Can’t wait for more content, keep up the great work and so happy to have you back ❣️
He was cancelled 2 years ago and still reached #3 on trending
We missed you Shane ❤️
Yay my favorite past time is back ❤️ We missed you so much 🥺
lmao I was actually panicking when yall were about to open the box of pizza right outside the chuck e cheese 💀
I can't help but rewatch 🥺 I really do love your videos so so much my older brother and I used to watch them all the time and he passed away in 2018 I wish he was here to watch and cackle w me today I love you🖤!
yay my happy place is back 🥺
Welcome back Shane! It is so good to see one of your videos again! SO excited for the conspiracy one!
Happy you’re back
I worked at Chuck E. Cheese and I have never watched them make the pizza but I have watched them cut them and the way they do it is crazy, also I had to wear the suit not fun
Shane is back! How exciting! ^.^ We've missed youuuu!
Yall figuring out the 🅿️ thing goodbye im crying omfg
i don't think chucks makes round pizza but that doesn't explain the gaps
I LOVE IT!!!!! WELCOME BACK SHANE!!!!!
Shane!! You’re absolutely amazing! You look so happy and refreshed!  Thank you for existing!
No I’m 6 mins in and it’s a mess I’m loving fir it  and I’m dying with laughter 😃😂😂
Colorado is a blue state… just saying
A new shirt? Wow this really is a simulation.
Never laughed so hard🤣
UMMMM i need a TPE Shirt. 💙💙💙
Get married and have a crumble cookie wedding cake!!
So excited to see Shane back and to see him happy :)
idk I feel like Shane and Ryland are two different people and they clash so much personality wise and Ryland isn't sensitive to any of Shane's triggers in every way even after he's spoken about it on the podcast.   don't get me wrong I love them both but they just... they've become cringe together. don't come for me I love Shane and Ryland but I'm starting to love them Separately as opposed to together. it just sucks cuz you know shane is not about money and I feel like all Ryland can talk about is money and spending money and being bougie and wanting big weddings big houses big cars big ass big that fancy this fancy that... idk .. I know no one cares about my opinion anyway. but it just hurts me sometimes to see Ryland putting Shane down or making Shane feel some way clearly on camera months after the podcast of him saying he feels like Ryland doesn't care about his triggers.  just after all this time I feel like theyve just become better friends than boyfriends.
Glad your back Shane!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hell yeah a video from my fav 😊
Shane stop I love this
Love seeing you and ryland, you guys bring me so much joy :) it’s like a little escape with friends 🥰
Ryland is so funny on this channel
Wait the camera guy is gay? When did he even come out? There was an entire video of them setting him up with that female dancer is that the same guy?
Genuinely, this video was so funny. I missed the laid back videos, less production and more intimate
do a wedding planning series!!!!!!!!
Shane is back I'm so happy! I missed him
Im not one of his subs, but i saw this in my recommendations and did not expect Shane's new upload after 3 months already. I Havent watched him for soo long since he got cancelled because of the cancel culture trend over a year ago.
Yaaaasssss
i understand that the pizzas were not recycled and the difference in sizes / misaligned toppings are due to the pizza cutter. But if that’s the case, shouldn’t they be replacing the cutter then? i know it would cost them a lot but it’s an improvement still. To me it looks like they just gave up on how their product looks. and they’re just going along with all the conspiracies because it’s publicity anyway 🤷🏻‍♀️
I haven't laughed this hard in a long time 😂 so glad you're back ❤
We love you so much. Thanks for posting. I need something like this these days.
We missed these types of videos from you Shane. Welcome back!!!
i am soooooooooo ready for a Shane podcast! Shane and Friends minus the weird stuff :)
this got me pissing and squealing 😭😭
The editing is too good 😂😂
Yay ❤️
I haven't watched this yet (I'm about to), but judging from the comments, this is GOOD TEA! lol ☕😊
I'm happy happy happy you are back xxxx
DID HE SAY $80 FOR THAT PIZZA
Couldn’t stop laughing. So glad you’re posting again! 😂❤️
The last 5 minutes of this video had me dying😂😂😂
Love you so much ❤️❤️❤️
I’m so happy ur back I missed u so much!!
I understand chuckle cheese getting angry but like why do they have to shape It that way??? Like they are just throwing themselves in the fire
I felt like I was just hanging out with y’all. Laughed so hard the whole time. Keep these up!
P
What would make the most sense is that they could be selling pizza by the slice and then when someone wants a whole, they grab the single slices and put them together so they don't waste the single slices and it wouldn't take as long to get a whole pizza out.
If only he noticed the Urgent Care clinic right behind him as he was talking about not being a doctor. Hilarious.
Missed you Shane!!!
RYLAND READING THE DEFINITION OF P OMFGGG
I was literally so sad when Shane and Friends ended. Definitely do a podcast! I would love to hear what you have to say now as much if not even more than I did then 💚
Thank you so much for uploading Shane 💗
i love this
Smiling again ☺️
This is my favorite Shane Dawson video with all the randomness
#TightThroatEnergy 🤣
This is such a strong 🅿️
Soooooo that's why i have always wanted to rob one of those money trucks... My senses and conscious was telling me to!
Why is this so much better than all of the boring stuff on Youtube right now?
I get it Shane 👀
We are defo living in a simulation, Chucky cheese was just programmed wrong 😉
This was 100% the best conspiracy episode! I laughed the whole time! I missed this Shane.
shane even the COLOUR ON THE LAST PIZZA ISNT ALL THE SAME, some of the cheese is more burnt than the other slices
The excitement I had when I saw Uno! And yelled oh my gosh UNO’s aliveeeeeeee!!!
SO HAPPY YOURE BACK!!!!! 🎥🤍
you should post more conspiracy videos like you did 3 years ago i’m constantly going back and rewatching them haha! so happy you’re back i grew up watching you
He's back and we are all here for it! So grateful!!
Can you do video with your podcast pls?!?!?
YES! Another podcast, can't wait!! 🎶Dunnuhnunnuh it's Farrah Abraham time dunnuhnunnuh God made a mistake🎶 😂😂

Since you guys live in colorado you could always elope!
🥺
Wow that would be so far out and creepy 😱
Yes. We get it Shane 😂😂
we made it!
Welcome back bitch!! 💓
Try not to get sued challenge
I had a pet psychic do a reading on my dog.  She said a lot of things she couldn’t have ever guessed.  Some of them guess by using items on your person or small things you say but this woman said something that was so impossible for her to know it shook me.  She said my dog was conveying to her that he really enjoyed jumping on the big blue round thing with all the kids.  A couple of weeks prior I had taken my dog to a relative’s house where he was jumping on a blue trampoline with all the kids. I’m am now a believer!
I loved this so much - both you and ryland seem so much more like your natural selves.. idk why that is, but i assume its because you guys are both just very happy in life, and not giving a f** what people think or feel about you. & honestly it makes the video sooo much better. & you are both so much funnier just chillin together not giving AF ❤️
Omg food videos pleeeease
People are just snowflakes nowadays. Like fuck. Learn to take a damn joke. There’s always someone that will get offended for anything
Please more conspiracies!!!!
Funniest thing I’ve seen in so long thank you
I LOVE YOU SHANE
LOVE YOU🤍🤍🤍
Someone’s never worked at a pizza place and it shows. Those slices were cut with hot cheese, the cheese oozes, cools, and displaces the slices. It looks the same as any other pizza
We made it 🤙
Love this! PLEASE bring back conspiracy documentary videos!!!! PLEEEEEASE!!!!!
I worked at a pizza place and honestly it's pretty easy to explain why the pizza looks like that, imo. If they didnt make their dough perfectly circular prior to baking, pieces can end up being different sizes. If the tool they are using to cut the pizzas isn't sharp enough or they are cutting too quickly, things can shift around and little slivers can end up missing (like if you cut a pizza at home and dont quite go over the same cut, you end up with little slivers missing). So i would say it's more common than people think for pizza to be a little wonky. MatPat did a video on Food Theory testing Chuck E Cheese pizzas, when they weren't doing dine in, and the pizzas still sometimes were a bit wonky. They can't be recycling pizza if no one is eating in the restaurant :)  I do agree that some of the pizzas floating around online from probably years ago have no explanation to why they look that way. But at least the ones they had in this video were honestly pretty normal
omgggg shane you’re whaaaat😩
Bring on the videos boo! I want whatever videos you feel like putting out. I loved this and I’m so glad you’re back ❤️
I laughed and smiled so much!
I might be too high for this shit 🥲😅
Ryland acting jealous was actually so cute. He’s like Shane is mine.
So much love from the 502 💕😈🦄
I peed while laughing
Ryland & the marvel movies thing has me cryinggggg😭😭 im literally him
senor pooh😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i wonder what they'd get if they asked for the pizza unsliced
You should’ve talked to Elon Musk or just watch some of his interviews
I really needed this <3 thank you for the laughs
I'm soooo glad you're back making videos Shane. I missed you making videos soooo much and I am glad you took time to sit back and reflect on everything so you can make more amazing content.
Bilingual
It’s SOOO good to have you back!!! We love you!!
I missed you so much
You can’t get cancelled if you don’t cancel yourself
If chuckecheese pizza got covid, it would be all the strains pushed together into one lmao
So basically EVERYTHING Elon Musk has been talking about for years and MOSTLY on Joe Rogans Podcast (BEST PODCAST EVER)
Hilarious, MORE PLEASE !!!  I Get you Shane . we fans <3 you!
Why is shane acting surprised like he doesn't know he snorts when he laughs lol
I have a lazy eye too it was way worse when I was born but you can still kind of tell
I was floored when you mentioned chuckie cheese pizza🤣😂🤣. The other day I was at my  local grocery store,and in the freezer section they actually had frozen chuckie cheese pizza. When did they decide to cover that area in the market??
I’m still so happy you’re back Shane!! I love your videos 🥺 thank you for still being here
Loved it🤗
I worked at Chuck E. Cheese and ours were never recycled. They were handmade, at least at the store I worked at. Couldn’t say about the others
This is the worst and most disorganized thing I have ever seen
This was soo funny, I’ve missed you so much
Ryland - “Preach, brother”  Why am I cackling
Lmao Shane looked like Edgar the drunk alien villain in men in black at 16:52
Welcome Back Shane!! This was funniest update ever! Chuck E. Cheeses still the place that haunts a pizza lovers nightmares!
When i saw his brother in Rylands vlogs....I knew!!! I love Shane and his brothers Conspiracy videos. Shane is a mood!!!!
HE’S BACK
Shane, you and Ryland could have a small wedding right on your property by the pond... Invite immediate family and close friends, wear comfy nice clothes (whatever you like) and have a reception right there after. Have Crumbl cookies and Chipotle catered if you want and Bam! A lovely, romantic wedding for you two that will be memorable and beautiful for you both while keeping it about your relationship and you two.  Also, would LOVE to listen to a podcast by you Shane!!!
I hate how funny you are
New you, New Queen
Love u Shane it's so good to have you back really missed you're videos
Shane I absolutely love you... I wish I could afford all of your merch.  💜
LOVE❤️🤣
Uuum is Shane merch canceled? Bc I carry my pig purse everywhere
You bring me so much happiness, I haven’t laughed this much in so long. So happy to have you back 🥰
I haven't laughed this hard in a HOT minute!! Thank you, Shane!!!
At 33:55 you can tell by the "burn" marks in the cheese and even the marks on the crust that the pieces actually do go together. They're just separated.
I love ya Shane!!! I just don’t get people that believe that we live in a simulation but think Jesus is not real!!!
but, but, i was going to bed....i was going to bed!! fine, 45 minutes later is fine i guess
Seeing a vagina in a dream doesn't always mean a sexual thing it can also be that a new project or idea is coming to fruition.
Missed you Shane❤️🥰 I’ve looked up to you for so long❤️
To answer the first second of the video.. no, nobody wants a conspiracy video.
SHANEEEEEEE SO HAPPY YOU POSTEd. KEEP POSTING NEVER STOP LOVE YOU P. ALSO, ITS THE LAWSUIT FOR ME :) ITS THE SHANE DAWSON FOR ME
This notification made me cry! Missed you boo!❤️ Better not leave again! Lol
Shane, don't ever think we don't want whatever you're serving us!  You always deliver and it's always amazing. Thank you!
Shane's acting like his personal relationship is a subset of drama from his last set of issues, is similar in holding value. Bless to Shane and his husband. However anyone with a brain stem can see this is fake asf
Can I just say we want anything Shane!😍😍
I got married in private with no wedding and no guests, and 10 years later I still dont regret it. Its YOUR special day.. spend it how you want.
Idc what you film and post, just don't dissappear again 💜
“If you’re watching this… you get it” 😳😭 dont call us out like that, i started laughing crying
I ate a crayon
He’s back
Shane : you see  me a goodwill buying my own merch  me : that’s a video
I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!! The end was a hilarious touch 😂 keep being you queen!!!!!!
Ryland did miss an opportunity there. He’s pushing 🅿️😭
4:19 is such a classic shane moment
At least there’s an urgent care across Chuck E. Cheese… you know.. just in case
The first 4mins already have me hooked already 😂  Shane is soooo epic
this is the shane that helped me through hella amounts of depression after coming out to nonacceptable parents. please keep making videos like this, i miss this shane! :')
I started sobbing when you said “because all of our guests left us.” I’m so happy you’re back and so thankful to see you just glowing ❤️
Watch the Mile Higher Podcast, it much better than what he’ll make. They also have other podcast that focuses in curiosity and darker stories. Support them! Not him
Love you Shane 💖
Have a cancel corner segment of your podcast and interview others whom have been canceled! (Ellen)
Welcome back Shane! I can't wait to see what all you have planned for this year.🙂💯💖🎉👍
I'm here for the podcast 🎉
I thought I unsubscribed years ago 😂. Thanks for reminding me
Pushing 🅿️
You sure are mean and dismissive to the person that kept you relevant.
Love this !!! Love Love love ❤️ just more more more 💗 I love when shane just randomly comes back !
Shane messing with Ryland lol
"tight pu$$y energy" 😭😂
this is so weird that he’s uploaded today, i literally woke up this morning feeling like watching some of his older videos and then this video pops up like whattt
Ryland panicking when he was trying to explain how the flying pig was symbolic KILLED ME😂😂😂
You all should go to Disney and do a conspiracy video thare

Pleaseeeee go to Disneyland and record it. That’s so comforting
💗
anyone else hear Woodys voice when u hear shane? XD
you’re the best, i’d love to listen to your podcasts!
I cried laughing this whole video. P.
THIS is what Ryland meant by saying Shane has been working on his own "projects" so he's been editing things on his own.   I just fed my kids lunchables for dinner so I could watch asap  😂 kidding but still so excited
Anyone else notice the URGENT CARE near the Chuck E. Cheese?lmaoooo
You sure are mean and dismissive to the person that kept you relevant.
Chris in the money outfit and Ryland in the elf dress has me DYING someone please make a meme out of that 😂😂😂😂😂
Lmao Shane face the entire time after opening the pizza box
chuck e. cheese is trash. "adopted from a third party" i died 😂
Still funny as hell❤️❤️
I need a whole video of you trying all of the Little Debbie ice creams!!!
Yassified shane has entered the chat:
I work on Papa John's Chile, I don't work in the store but I think the pizza slides are weird because of the cuttin. We had some similar cases but we change the protocol for cuttin and it was solved 😬
Gurl. At this point just stop making videos.
I like how Ryland keeps reminding him that they want to be NOT SUED. hahaahhaa.
not shane paying his lawsuit back in promo videos 😂😂😂
💕❤️💕❤️💕❤️💕
Shane....this content...it's soooo....AMAZING! I've said it once and I'll say it again, I can tell when it's something you actually enjoyed filming and creating because the experience I have as a viewer mimics those same feelings of joy and excitement. Keep it up queen!
Yes yes yes yes yes! Couldn't stop smiling or laughing at your silly self. Thank you. The internet needs Shane.
Omg I love your videos you really just made my day better I’m so glad your back and I’ll be in Colorado march 5th so hmu
pizza gate?
I'm wondering if you're aware of the Food Theory episode on Chuck.E Cheese. Either way it's awesome to see you getting back into what you love doing, Shane.
Food theory already made a video about debunking the pizza at Chuck'E Cheese. It's just the weird pizza cutter they have. It was good video you should check it out.
Omggg this video was amazing! I was laughing so hard.
What a nice suprise 💃🏻
This video, absolute beauty! Loved every second
80 DOLLARS ON 3 PIZZAS?!
So glad you're back. Really missed you, your videos always make me smile ☺️
YEEEEEEEES IM SO HAPPY 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Love you Shane ❤️
I missed your videos shane! I met you back at morphe in th mall of America and you were the nicest person in the whole world to me. I'd die to meet you again.
I have never laughed so hard!!! Needed this today! So happy to have an update on the pizza hahaha! Can’t wait for the podcast! Love you Shane! This content is so refreshed! So happy for you!!!
The pepperoni should be obvious, as the pepperonis get cut and match up on the adjacent slice.
"I'm gonna call you Chrissstmas, because you stole my ♥" (Ryland) "HEY, I don't have a Vagina!" LoL... I love these two... Keep them coming...
"A f***ot a squealing f***ot" im☠
Yayyyyy
And with that SHANE THE GREAT is BACK!
I watched all 27 marvel movies over christmas break too lmao
Yay Shane uploaded and brought he's brother back!!!!!! I'm so happy right now
Shane!!! We all needed this so bad!! Thank you for coming back!!  Keep making all the stupidest shit ever because it’s made by you and we love you!!!
I loved this so much lol Shane we MISS YOU AND LOVE YOU!!!!!
Thank you for coming back to us.💙
I love you Shane 💜 I’m so glad to see you back and doing well 💜
Shane I miss your conspiracy video wishing for you to make more 💓
I’ll happily watch your 17 ads out of support if you get sued 😂. Glad you’re back!
Omg I’ve been wishing for shane to have a podcast again <3 and I’ve never thought it would happen again! Good luck shane and wishing for the best of itt
please leave Colorado im tired of seeing you at target
It's the blade they use to cut the pizzas that's why they look like frankensteins pizza
I need the 'tight pussy energy' merch to be a thing!😂 💚
Shane’s brother is so interesting to listen to!  And Shane is so hilarious I missed the jokes sooo much
Haven’t watched your videos in a looooooooong time
Lol the pizza has changed and here in TX they renovated pretty much all of them!
Off topic but I don’t understand how Americans call them truck’s, we call them utes in Australia which makes sense 😅😅
I guess if you say it enough, it'll come true🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣#liveyourtruth🤣🤣🤣
We love you shane😝 anything you post will make us happy were just glad your back
Omg...the banana cream pie cookie was EVERYTHING!!!! My littlest turned 9 on 2/2/22 and wanted crumbl for her bday....minus the pb and choco chunk, they were to die for!!!!
I haven’t laughed this much in a while! Dang, I missed this!
Yessssssss I missed this Shane! Keep going! Your fans are still here!
Duuuuuuuude the moment you said "2022 i aint gonna be there" shit i felt that🤣🤣 didnt think id make it either. Glad to see you back shane
This made my day even better and I'm happy that you are posting videos again I hope to see a conspiracy theory videos
'I know you probably want a new conspiracy video' what we want is for you to take GENUINE responsibility for the disgusting acts you did- like turning the comments back on, having a livestream where people can talk to you directly about what you did or at least reacting to everything you did on your video instead of ignoring half the shitty things that have been uncovered. This isn't 'drama' or 'cancel culture' its crime and it deserves to be addressed way more than it has been.
Do the podcast!!! You're literally my favorite person ever. You can talk about absolutely nothing and I watch every second
When I talk about my spirit guide I always feel crazy but it’s true and I’ll never stop talking about mine lol I’m learning how to use my abilities to read people as well!!!
Shane’s videos make me happy. His friends and him are so funny and I especially ❤️ his conspiracy theory videos can’t wait for the next one!😎
BICOASTAL BISEXUAL QUEEN THE SCREAM I SCROME
Fly on drugs again lol soooo funny.  Glad ur BACK
“I mean it ruined my life” I mean you’re not wrong 😂
I love youre creative mind Shane! talking about pussies 90% of the video hahahahahhaah xDxDxD <<33 But seriously it can take ''50'' months between you uploading any videos and i will never stop being exited for etch and every one om them! <3 Keep it up (in youre paste). Big fan, and thanks.
Who gives a shit about everything else
Hear me out… Shane’s 🅿️ oddcast.
i’m not watching all that, someone please tell me who is sueing who
yaazzzz!!! more videos please shane!! love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
this made my day , you're both so funny
Wouldn’t hate a Republican Shane ❤️
Miss your funny content
you help me so much <3 never stop posting!
I low key love the passiv aggressiveness
You are the player, the game, and every single character.
This video was so entertaining and funny!😂
OMG do u now live here in Colorado?!😍😍😍😍😍
Why is there so much passive aggressive energy in this video. I'm worried
Shane is so fucking hilarious
When shane said hey its my lawyer. An ad poped up for a lawyer. Wtf strange
I honestly have a theory about the Chucky Pizza if you cut the pizza before cooking the slices will actually change sizes I used to do it all the time when I worked in a pizza place
This was everything!!! Hopefully we will see more of you guys being so happy 😊  I loved it. Had to watch it twice to see the pure joy in Shane's eyes 🥰🥰🥰
My therapist told me that it’s really common to not think you will make it past a certain age/year if you had a traumatic past. So you’re normal, Shane! As normal as any of us are.
This is a different side of him. I like it.
Ok here’s my theory in the pizzas… Chuck cuts them on a senate board with a big pizza cutter and then it gets THROWN in the box. The pizza slices get all displaced , then it starts to cool down and the cheese solidifies that’s why you can’t move them right back together 🤷🏻‍♀️ meh probably not. 🐀
Yay haven’t laughed in a while, missed shane
I am so glad I ate this edible tonight!!!!!! Shane i love youuu!!♥️♥️😂😂
So happy ur back ur one of my favorite YouTubers♡♡♡
Shane this is very special.
hoping the Americans got chuck e cheese ads on this video
Shane, I do like videos like this. You look like you're doing better mentally and physically. Right on man. Excited to see what you have in store for us this time. Hope you keep giving this energy.
Love! Your videos make my heart happy! Please don't leave again!
Best advice I've ever heard! " before you know, you dint know....." LEGIT LMAO
Shane! Just elope! Seriously. I did the wedding thing and it sucked. Would’ve much rather spent the money on an awesome elopement/honeymoon.
SHANE!!! You're so bubbly and happy 😭 this is what I needed today
used to work at an arcade (not CEC) but it’s probably bc they sell slices so they add extra slices from different pizzas (not other consumed pizzas) just to make a whole
Hilarious 😂 love the random goofy vids, think a podcast would be awesome!
Make a conspiracy theory podcast
Yeazzzz the queen is back!!!
If anything I think it makes sense that the pizzas that they do half and half they make a full pepperoni and a full cheese and if someone wants a half one of them they basically use a half from one and a half from the other. I doubt that’s what they do but it looks like that
Sooo thought 😂 it’s a mouse And recycled pizza that’s all imma say
I bet that Chucky Cheese sells also by the slice, so when they get an order for a whole pizza, they trade out their current stock of slices with the fresh, so that there is rotation and everything stays fresh and abides by food safety laws. Actually makes a lot of sense. But if this is the case, why not just come out and say it.....? Pizza def sketch, and no way there wasn't trade or three each pie
We want it all!! Love this. Thanks for blessing us with you!!
Wow i did not knowwwww that Shane was bi. Interesting lol😶
you should be Chucke Cheese for Halloween
❤❤❤
I loved this Shane seriously keep doing videos
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT WINNIE THE POOH!!!!????
So excited for your comeback. This is honestly the first video since everything happened where it feels normal again!
I found Shane during quarantine...so I wasn’t here when he was uploading regularly...sounds like the conspiracies are coming back with some new stuff and I can’t wait!!!!!
Hilarious. Love to see you back baby 💜
Yeah that’s god 🙄 he has everything planned out for us.
Looooove seeing new videos from you!!! Can’t wait for the pod
I was watching this at the gym and trying not to bust out laughing 😆
I’m so excited
Chuck e Cheese: what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.  I have eaten Chuck e Cheese many times and I’m still here. So! 🤷🏻‍♀️
Creep
OMG SHANE, my husband and o are so happy you’re here and this video is happening. Literally I feel like I’m dreaming. This is awesome. I’ve been dying for this kind of videos. I just wanna see you and how you’re doing and this is everything. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
i havent laughed from a youtube video in SOOO long. o mg.
i’m so happy your back literally made my week also pushin p by gunna is what u need to listen to
YES! I missed watching Shane's videos! This is a great surprise!
Everything leading up to  4:15 is GOLD. It could've ended there and I would have been more than satisfied.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I'm so dead.
Just so you know, Im so happy that you're back!!
I've listened to all the old podcasts multiple times. I loved the conspiracy theorie ones soo much.
Dude I love Shane 😭✋🏻his vids always got my laughing fr
Notice how ryland is in your videos but not taking it over he just kinda stays off to the side... unlike how you constantly jump in front of him or just take over rylands videos now constantly inserting yourself and just making it about you... you have your channel he has his... be polite in his vlogs like he does yours... oh and the hair use to be cute now it's getting so drastic that its giving me Donald Trump vibes... I'm dead serious not even trying to be mean... think of me as one of those people that tells you something about yourself that you dont want to hear but you really need to hear
I’ve missed you so much!!!🥺❤️
you’ve literally become 10x more funny 😭❤️
This was a fun video
I am beyond excited about this. Not only is Shane in such a wonder place right now but I’ve been dying for some deep conspiracy content. So proud of you!  Also there is a ChuckECheese in NJ where I live and the pizza is actually awesome. I went for my daughter’s birthday last year.
Yes to the simulation video
Real celebrities! Real Art! Not these YouTubers going on vacation after vacation partying. That’s not contributing to the environment, community & world!   Let’s start w/ jake gyllenhaal♥️
Legit giggled the whole time. I have missed thissssss Shane!! THIS turns that frown upside down. (Knee slap, BIG chuckle) 😂
Don't eat their food, great way to get sick and right now that's not good.
I'm just happy your posting again. I would watch anything you posted. 😁
I love this. It’s giving 2019-2020 Shane 😍
I needed this 😂.. you should really do more videos like this. like a day and a life their  so entertaining
So glad you’re back Shane!
$80 for THREE PIZZAS!?
i still own my oh my god shirt and still wear it. we all make mistakes. i did not see any reason so get rid of it. i missed you. glad you're back
This Video brightened up my day :) was waiting for it since you announced it on instagram
About bloody time too ❤️
Anyone else think ryland coming out with that pizza was hot d—-
Me whenever a family member asks me a question related to my future  5:06 - 5:09
Literally my spirit animal “if your watching this video you get it”
Was having a bad day and this is exactly what I needed!
Haven’t laughed this hard in so long! I love it! 😂😂😂
Ugh! 20 mins in & I've had to fast forward through most of it. I think Shane peaked 3 years ago....
SHANE IS BACK🥰😍😍😍😍
You should stay in LA
Shane, I get it
This actually had me laughing out loud pls make more this was so funny
I love that he is being avant garde like not afraid of being “cancelled” this is the best Shane.
Its so awesome to see your brother again
Meow
Yaaassssss 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
You can call him Chris Crumble, kinda like Kris Kringle.
The person controlling my brain: “lets make her watch this video so I don’t look sus”
i’m so happy ur back
I was laughing so hard I was crying!!! Need more videos like this in my life!
if we're in a simulation then why haven't i found the cheat code to be skinny yet
I thought he said," all the crubs " 😆 l
I laughed so hard during the Rylan describing Shane honking lmao i almost choked on my dinner 🤣😂
I want to be in your podcast!!! I'm a small business startup and I love you and Ryland. Please you can throw in some brown sugar in the tea
I LOVE YOU
You guys should make a homemade pizza with homemade pizza dough and see if it comes out all wonky like theirs does.
honestly if i were chuck e cheese is lean into the pizza thing & make them even worse & be like “it’s wacky & fun for the kids!!”
I'm 3 mins in and my day has already been made. Love you Shane
I wonder what would happen if you order the pizza and ask them not to cut the slices...
Yay you’re coming back slowly!!!! Love it!! Missed you so much
“This is our wedding” Ryland was NOT having that joke lolol
Ayyyy
Watching this was like visiting with old friends, never gets old ❤️
TPE shirts best be in the works
“This is probably not what you want”. UM this is exactly what I want! I love the random videos. I laughed so much! Please do more of these random videos. They’re not stupid, they’re actually very entertaining! And I’m so hyped for the podcast, it’s gonna be awesome!
A PODCAST WOULD BE AMAZING PLEASE SHANE
Man I missed this<3
I missed you ❤
Wedding idea. A tower of crumble cookies arranged in cake form as your wedding cake.
I thought "pushin 🅿️" had something to do with drugs. Am I crazy or just old? I am by the way im 38. I guess I could ask my 4 teenagers 🤣
This is so filthy and I love it! I feel like I'm watching Shane and Friends.
I definitely think you should ask for a whole pizza UNCUT and that will be the true test! Be like “haha sorry for a strange request, but can I have a pizza uncut cause it’s just for myself and I’m doing a eating challenge”
I enjoyed the shit out of this. Keep them coming. 😍
Pushin 🅿️
Hey Shane! Love you! That is all. 😂
Shane’s faces at 11:46  are giving Utica from Drag Race when Ru asks has she ever smoked weed 😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
I never ever EVER want to not have this Shane in my life 🥰 Seeing you so happy and free gives me life! I can’t wait to see what you come up with next.
Why did the title make me burst out laughing 😂
Omg Shane i love your videos! Im so exited your coming back queen 🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐽🐽
Before you know you don’t know....that has got to be a thing...please let’s make it the next thing LOL!!!
9:00 omg I loving this! Now you're going to take off ....lmao
Shane’s what made me start listening to podcast. You and Jessie were such a good pair: I hope you bring her back for a few episodes
Oh my goodness Shane! Thank you for this! Hearing you and Ryland today made me entire week! Ive been going through some depression due to weather and family issues. Literally was the best update today! Thank you so much Shane ❤❤
Rylands lying. Last time my husband and I had chuck e cheese pizza, my husband was on the toilet the entire birthday party.. and imo the pizza was card board

The fact Chuck E. Cheese tried surging Shane is hilarious lmfaooooo 💀 😂 and also I get it Shane I get it LOL “well we made it” 😅😭🤣
I feel like he's deleting negative comments...
Shane!!!!!! This video was so good!!!  Im so glad that your are back and not giving a fu*#! I love your sense of humor the darker the better!  I love your jokes from 10 years ago!   So start making a few videos a week!  Btw are you watching Rich Lux lately?  He is so funny!! I adore me some Rich Lux!  Mowthess (moses) bring me my water Mowthess!!!  So funny!  You need to do some videos with Rich Lux!  Do a Jake Paulesque~esh~ish series/ Jeffree series but with Rich Lux!!  That would be exquisite darling!!   Im so sorry where are my manners!? I'm Oliver Manpusse.. pleasure im sure...   btw have you seen Bridget Fonda lately!?   Gawd Damn I was Shook! Im mean literally when she walked by the ground shook!  Lol. Seriously though.

The hardest I laughed in a while. I miss you Shane
Why is everyother pizza round
Next time if you ever go to chuck e cheese ask them to not cut your pizza! I would be curious to see what the pizza would look like
I haven't quite laughed at a youtube video like this for a long time...

I could watch you guys all day long.
does anybody else ship Shane and Chris 👀 by Ryland
This video made me happy 🤣 welcome back
Everyone in this comment section is miserable or depressed. We all need Jesus, now more than ever.
You shouldn't have a platform 😌
this was the sequel that I never knew I needed
I forgot how funny shane is lol, soo glad he's back!!
i missed your videos so much im so glad your back im happy to see you shane. can't wait for more videos
Shane you seem so much happier and healthier,  and like you’re in a much better place.  It’s refreshing to see and makes me super happy for you.  Glad that you’re living your best life again because you deserve it.
Should someone explain that all marvel fans along with me that I know are somewhere in the LGBTQ+  community
Thank u Shane for posting it’s been such a hard year for me and seeing you post makes me feel so much better love u Shane  <3
I will definitely listen... especially the conspiracy stuff
Literally the only video that I would sit through an hour to watch 😂😂
I'm sorry you paid $80 for 3 large pizzas....Holy f*ck
YESSS!!! Please do a podcast again!!! Please put it on apple podcast, I’ll listen to on my walks!! 😍😍😍
Bruh I miss the conspiracy videos so much I love this his brother is so into them as well as he is!! It makes me so happy Shane’s back making videos 💖💖
Hey Shane! I know you’re never gonna see this comment but 🅿️ was created by an multi platinum Atlanta rapper named Gunna, and the term is short for playa (player) which means cool, real, etc. when you say it you’re supposed to say pushin’ 🅿️.
Oh bless. Ry, he’s been snorting this whole time 😭🤣
Hay! Don't joke about that, you're either a Republic or one of them dirty democrats, who try to sabotage America!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ((Oh, god damn it) but, I mean, do what you want to do, say whatever you want to say, as, long, as, it, doesn't, hurt, anyway, or, break the law (umm, forget what a said, never mind, (I hope 🙏🏻 the doesn't make me sound worse or like I'm one of them instead, man, not falling into traps is hard)))
I like how there’s a Pizza Hut ad on this video 😂😂
hopefully "chuckie" self reflected... AKA chris's EX!!! efff him btw
THIS IS SUCH A COMFORTABLE VIDEO
I was eating a Crumbl cookie as i was watching this video................
25:52
Should we tailgate 😂😂
I’ve missed your videos so much! I love you guys I’m so happy you are back! 💕
We love you Shane ❤️
“Rumor”
Wow I needed this video so bad. It was great to see the old Shane again. Just relaxing and laughing my face off to some Shane Dawson is the perfect night for me.   P.S     I hope they get married soon.They are so cute together. Love you guys ❤️
I cant wait for more conspiracy videos from shane. Those are my favorites along with his haunted videos!!! Youtube sucks without Shane Dawson!!!
Chuck E Cheese new slogan, “deliciously unique”
80$?????!
So funny!
Awwe Shane is back to himself,  laughing and joking around. 😂 I love it!!! 💕
I love you so ducking much Shane glad you’re back 🥰
Awwww Shane, I'm happy you're doing well and this video was just the right shade of wholesome and hilarious!
It’s good to see you posting again, Shane! Excited for this new chapter!
I think rylands a little jealous of chris
Never thought I would see Shane in a truck🤣
Wooo ur back🥰🥰🥰
WELCOME BACK !!!!!
Shane if you ever leave Ryland please let it be for me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No, you are the person watching the player control your brain. But, you have the ability to control the player therefore controlling the game thru the player.
i’m showing my friends this and it gets funnier every single time😂
Thank the Lord you are back! You look fantastic and a podcast is a phenomenal idea! Can’t wait to see everything you are now going to be doing again 👍🏼🥰
couldnt stop laughing during this, really felt like i was catching up with an old friend. glad to see youre posting again <3  and the "we made it part" was super relatable btw.
I can't take anything Shane's brother says seriously, I have zero respect for people who believe the earth is flat.
❤
Shane, local socal wedding florist here. Get married somewhere that means a lot to you guys, wear whatever the fuck you want, invite your family and closest friends, do a buffet and have crumbl be your desserts. Trust me, it’s worth it and you don’t have to do anything traditional to have a gorgeous, fun day
The only thing that makes sense about the pizza if it was a big blade and they constantly had to move the pizza in order to cut it and then they don’t line it up every time that they cut so each slice is different
I have totally thought about this so many times about the simulation of people lol.
23:54 why didn’t anyone say “no, Ryland! We’re just trying to order a pizza!”
80$!!!! Imo they don’t make to order. They make several pies of each topping and they’re fitted together. Each topping is part of a whole pie of its type. Takes a lot of touching of the pizza, even with gloves, to fit them together in a box. Yuck. Papa john’s makes to order, you’ll see if you order two toppings each on half the pie the topping might go over the half and the crust is of one pie.
When you do your podcast you should do conspiracy theories on Thursdays and call it Theory Thursdays!
Let me be the Andy Richter to your conan Obrien. I swear, my mom says I'm funny enough to be your podcast sidekick. You know what they say, always trust strangers.     Seriously big fan though.
I laughed so hard 😂😂😂 this is such a good video
💙💙💙💙
I missed you and your video's so much. This had me laughing so hard and I really needed this video. Thank you, Shane!
pleeeaassseeeee post funny vids like this more often!
This is the only problematic shyt I will ever willingly allow into my life and boyyy did I need it. It's been a long time since I laughed for 40mins straight
😂😂😂😂😂😂
bozo comin back wtf 💀
Take that shirt
You are a natural at it  ! Podcast will be soooooo amazing for you ! Especially if it has anything to do with conspiracy theory’s!!! Don’t let anyone or anything get in your way!
y'all need a tv show I love this random content
Shane u have really been looking good recently did you lose some weight it looks like you did and you over all look good and healthy. Also you seem like the creativity is back and I wish you well with all of it! The Colorado  move was good for you! You got away from the haters and it shows! good for you!! Treat yourself good - you deserve it
In case anyone was wondering, I counted 11 vaginas and 5 pussies.
The king is back!!!
This video is 🅿️😂
Also I would love to see a small video about how you was able to connect  and communicate to your spirit guide. Whatever information you have would be amazing
missed you and your videos so bad! so glad to have you back ❤️ love you
This was so much fun.! I love the silly and spontaneous videos. So nice to see you and Jeffree just having fun on youtube again.
When you know when they filmed this video because of the type of Crumbl cookies that are in the box 😂 banana cream pie was last week 😂😂😂
It my birthday today and this was a great gift Shane
Well then the guy that plays as me is an asshole
Do you think they cut it before they cook it? Maybe would make the gaps make sense
So happy to see this upload from you shane! Excited for your future endeavors. I will be supporting whatever you put out
Awwe I’m soo gladdddddd to see you ❤️❤️
What an absolute injection of joy and laughter at the end of my day. Thank you Shane. I have been watching you since your floppy hair and wig days. May God bless you in this new season of your life.
so we are just going to forget what happened??????
Go to universal too! You don't gotta worry about the seats i know from experience 😂😂
We are all so happy u r back. I laughed so much watching this. Love u Shane! Keep posting we r all watching!!!!
This is exactly what I wanted.  Cant stop laughing.
Here I am, beautiful and unique in my own way. And here you are…that.
Can we maybe start with more videos?  Loved the podcast but I'd rather see and hear from you, rather than what may be shocking or get views
gosh havent seen jared in a while im looking forward to it! so glad your back! been a fan since the begining! and a podcast would be amazing!
Omg, you make me crack tf up lmao😂😂
Lmao Ryland eating $80 of pizza so he doesn’t get sued with you 😂😃
❤️❤️❤️
shane is back ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ i love his humor ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Well have you seen the Chef puppet he not the best cutter lol .. Shane behave
So happy you are in my life again. Please dont ever leave !
Maybe Chuck e cheese uses slices from the whole pizzas used to sell single slices to customers?
I would class Ryland as an Otter and Shane is almost a Cub. Neither are uber hairy though :D I'm down for the UFOs and pornstars, let's go! (And Ryland's tight vagina.) Lol
Oh my gosh the title scared me I was about to get passed if some bogus stuff started up 😆
Thoughts and prayers for Ryland and his inevitable gastrointestinal distress 🙏🏻
40 minutes of shane YESSS
The way I missed Shane and friends is indescribable I’m so excited 🥺
After watching this... You hypnotized me to have pizza. 😵😵😵😵😋😋😋😋😋🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
Call him Chris Crumbl!! 🤣
I want a Disneyland video now 😹😹
the conversation shane,ryland and chris were having in the beginning. was funny asf to me. literally was in tears.
I’ve missed Shane so much ❤️can’t wait for the podcast
wait omg shane ur bi??
i hope u still want to make horror movies u would do amazing 🥺
I forgot how funny Shane was. Can’t wait to see your new content!! <33
so glad ur back :)))
I needed this today 😂
God I missed you!
Shane you look so good, happy and confident. Thank you for this video, I am so glad you are back xoxox
The disclaimers about Chuck E. Cheese is making this funnier
Yassss it's been to long ⚰️🔥
Yas Queen!! I've missed ur video's 💓
Shane trying not to get sued by Chuck E. Cheese for 10 minutes 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I missed Shane's goofy self <3
Honestly I was thinking they were combining unbought slices because of their "by the slice" option. So if they made a few cheese and pepperoni pizzas and people bought half the slices and someone orders a whole pie they might assemble one from that rather than letting it sit out longer or tossing it. I would be super shocked if they actually resold served pizza. Complete health code violation.
They said “let’s come back with a fun little transphobic bit!”
I missed this
It’s crazy how much nothing footage he just leaves in given the amount of editing he does. This 43 and a half minute video should have been 15-25 minutes max, and that’s with leaving plenty of nothing still in it. For instance, the whole part when they went into his temporary office?! There was zero reason for that. They walked in, talked about nothing, and walked out. Why did you decide to waste our time with that meaningless 6 minutes?! Even the entire part after that talking about Ryland having a vagina and Emma’s coffee… a whole lot of nothing. Nothing is happening. Until he starts talking about a podcast. I don’t understand why it’s so important to you to waste peoples time with so much nothing
You probably could have called it "The Lawsuit" as opposed to "tHe LaWsUit oF ShAnE DawSOn"  Lol. Love ya Shane ❤😚
the conspiracy jacket 😍😍😍
yo what
When Ryland said “honk” instead of “snort” 🤣
WHEN I TELL YOU I ZOOOMED OUT OF WORK JUST TO COME HOME TO WATCH THIS I DIIID 😭 IM SOOOOO HAPPY THAT HE LOOKS SO MUCH HAPPIER AND HEALTHIER. I love you Shane ❤️😭
You snorted while laughing like 20 times haha I love it !
My player is a shitti one
You want to do a new conspiracy. Do a conspiracy about the shit that’s going on right now in the world, global awakening. I’d bet you get canceled again because of the censorship.
Ima need a C.E.C. employee to post a behind the scenes vlog or something cus it literally don't add up! Bout to go get a job there myself just to get to the bottom of this ish! 😂
Gosh, Shane, I've missed your videos so much. glad you back uploading. I'm glad you're having fun making them. keep it up and keep  being you :)
Like how yall jumped on the move out of California ban wagon
The manic energy is so relatable
Flip over each Chuck E. Cheese slice and see how they look on the bottom maybe?
I like his brother. But some of his "logic".....  Hurts my last brain cells
The pizzas probably aren’t cooked inside of a circular pan so the dough isn’t going to be perfectly round, like most chain pizza places do it. I’m convinced that’s why! I enjoyed the video 😊
Ngl the Colorado comments were kinda offensive. You lived in a suburb of Denver. You kinda painted all of Colorado as country yet you lived in Denver. You don’t know Colorado. Shut up about it.
Shane be poking the bear, lol.
keep going shane dear ♡♡♡
Shane: disguise Everyone: dresses in way to make obvious attention 🤣 💗💗💗
How can they sue you for pointing out facts? Is that not just free speech and evidence?
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Just another person who really really missed this. Shane, you are reaching people just by being you and doing this video. It was my first smile of the day, thanks for the little escape. Keep going
Honestly i think its because they cut it when its right out of the oven & the cheese is so soft once it gets cooler then it hardens making the cheese might get into the nook of the cut. If that makes sense. So that could be a possibility
Best thing I've seennnn ...I love ur videos !!!! ❣️❣️
I just LOVE this, that is all. Can't wait for more.
We made it.💜
ive been really depressed lately to the point where im ghosting most people in my life except my mom and you made me smile the entire video. thank you
I have watched Shane Dawson for YEARS. This is THE Shane….makes me so proud. It’s the growth hunny, the growth!!! 👏🏻 👏🏻 I laughed so hard at this. ❤️
OMG I MISS YOUR PODCAST SO MUCH PLEASE START UP A NEW ONE
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH SHANE
Damn Shane would be so much easier to cancel if he wasn't so funny and YouTube wasn't so dry 😂
you lost so much weight!!!!!<3 baby looking hot lolololol loovve you shane
so happy to know that there’s more videos to come, excited for sure 💜
That made me so happy!
This was great!!! Hope to see you more!
We ❤️ you Shane! (& Ryland)
So nice to see you back! Also, will there be any video collab with Jefrree Star?
WHAT IF THEY CUT THE PIZZA BEFORE THEY COOK IT?!?! dunno if that’s been said before and it’s completely unorthodox BUT it makes sense…… RIGHT
The no way that shit was 10 years ago 😦
41:15 to 41:24 is my favorite clip of this whole video 🤣
I have truly missed your videos. Thank you for the laughs ❤️
I am so happy Shane is filming again! I truly miss him💙
Some trashy political jokes.. good one. That's why Republicans hate liberals. Yall are weak and sensitive lol
I have not laughed like that in awhile thank you Shane!
Does shane not know his conspiracy videos are the most viewed on YouTube when you search conspiracy... 50 million views people love you. Your here to tell the mass the "truth".
this is the content i’m excited for!!!!!!!!! love love
If he knows this type of content can put him in a very bad situation (legally) why he keeps doing this shit !? 😅  You guys should make a pizza at home and slice the pizza and see what happen, maybe the result can give you guys answers.
Welcome back king 👑
The fact earlier today I was watching his videos and then just now I checked again and he has a new video literally sent me
🅿️
so excited for this
Lmmfao...I laughed so hard...and how Ryland took that last slice piece  and he was like a kid...lmmfao 🖤🖤🖤 I've missed u dude...

I smoked before watching this and I can't breathe I'm laughing so hard! I'm so happy you're back Shane! I've missed you're videos

Bridgette Marquadt from Girls Next Door, Playboy fame, has a podcast about ghosts & paranormal things. She would be a great guest & maybe tick all your boxes. LOL!!!
Shane should do a podcast again
WE MADE IT LOL
This brought so many smiles to my face!!!!
I have missed this content!
Missed u so much shane

Fun fact, you can order food from Chucke Cheeze on DoorDash lmfao
TPE
The fact that is was just watching his videos today for the first time in forever and this pops up is just incredible
love love loveee yall energy ahhhh !! <3 can't waitt for the weddinggg. THAT WILL BREAK YOUTUBEEE 🥰🥰🥰

Omg when he said hey chrissy I was so confused for a second
This video made me so happy, glad to have you back Shane :3
0:30 that's Eren Shane don't worry hehe
Oh I lost it at the chuck e cheese bit ugh
Shane I have missed your vlogs, you are so funny. In a healthy self deprecating way, I was laughing so hard I snorted. So excited that you are back and looking forward to your future endeavours and you would be classified as an adorable bear.
have you guys seen the Crumbl ice cream?
You made my day, Shane 😂❤️
I cannot lie.... I have mixed feelings on Shane.
Podcast will be great ,I’m still want a paranormal video.
Omg!!! Queen!!! God we missed you. You look so good Shane! Stay positive and stay happy!
She is back!!!!!! We love it! This is what I needed again!
When he said most psychics aren't real, that was a complete bash towards the psychic twins lol
YASSS omg i miss shane and friends so much
Omg WE MISSSED YOU.. HUGS ALLLLL AROUND LOL & please for the love of god, marry ryland 😝  *love from Canada 🇨🇦*
I feel like we've all been through so much sh*t in the last couple years. It feels SO good to just feel these vibes again. Thank you Shane for coming back. You have true fans out here. ❤️
Very happy :) ❤️
Oh yay!! Little Debbie ice cream review!! It’s one I suggested!! I need to see this lol… can’t wait for your podcast and your conspiracy videos but frankly will watch anything you put out… I just enjoy all your and Rylands content!! ❤️ so so happy your back and feeling creative and inspired again!! I really really missed you ❤️
missed you:(
You should get the pizza and look at the bottom of the pizzas to see if they were cooked the same bc the ring on the bottom or the spots of how it was cooked and then you can tell if it’s different pieces of pizzas
This is what I needed today. So great to see you post again.
Like for Shane to start back doing Conspiracy Theory videos
This makes me so happy 🥲 I have been waiting so long for a new Shane video! I just wish it was longer!!! I get sad when the video is over 😂 Honestly anything you do Shane is incredible, don’t doubt yourself ever. Love from Australia 🇦🇺❤️
i was watching rylands videos before you stopped posting youtube videos before the pandemic; and when you started popping up in rylands videos more it made me so happy cause i missed you so much shane! love you both so much; and you be the unapologetic bitch that you are! we are rooting for you and i hope to see more videos you post this year! i love you!
Ryland is an Otter and Shane is a Cub. Gay-splain'd
I haven’t laughed this hard in such a long time! I’m so glad you’re back, Shane! I missed you so much! Ive always looked forward to your videos from the very beginning, but you look so happy and healthy now, taking a well deserved break was what you needed♥️ I can’t wait for your podcasts and conspiracy videos, and I hope you continue to make random videos like this, definitely brightened my day!!♥️
41:17 No shade... but omg what have ya'll been feeding UNO? lol He's so much larger than he was before.
That notification was a suprise
Some of these pics of pizza idk but  When I used to make pizzas sometimes  when u spread the dough on size will Shrink and sometimes u just gotta go with it  Then with it not sticking back together the cornmeal makes it dry out faster you’d have to put cheese back on it n put it through the oven
Rylan "had a pussy"LMAO fuckin Shane's hilarious🤣🤣🤣🤘💯
This is JUST what I needed! YAAAAY!!!! And a new podcast too?! Omg 😱 That would be EVERYTHING!!!! It’s about damn TIME!!!!! All I’ve been saying is that I wish Shane had a podcast!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Oh how much I missed you 😩
I laughed so much watching this. Love all your videos ❤️
If I owned Chuck E Cheese, I'd be pissed.   Shane likes to tempt fate I guess.
missed you 😣💛
Please make more of these Shane! Absolutely loved this video
me and my bf watched this n was crackin up the whole time …. missed ya shane <33
love this ❤️❤️
“It’s weird he always wants to talk criticism” Ryland saying what we’re all wondering
finally posting on ur own channel!!! love yewww shane!!! yeeee
the real way to tell if the pizza is jacked up would be to let it cool completely and then flip it over. If it would line up if pushed back together then shes good [bc I hope that theyre just pulling it apart to serve]
Twitter rn: WHY HAVE YOU LEFT YOUR CAGE
This was so funny I peed my pants 😂 I missed this just basic comedy stuff love yinz!!
This (I have no idea what it is) vlog? Shitpost? Phone dump? ADHD documentation is the most fragmented and bizarre thing I’ve ever watched.
34:07 its the "Preach brother" for me 😭
🤣🤣🤣 I am laughing so hard watching this 🤣🤣🤣
Bilingual, girl.
What happened to the other camera man? Where’d he go?
I bet Jason Nash would be a pod guest
Yes! It’s confident Sean!
The truck fits Shane so well 🥰🥰 and the best notification is seeing a new video up.
<3
It’s not 2018 we don’t want conspiracy videos WE WANT ANSWERS !
I miss Shane pls upload more
CANCELLED ANONYMOUS ☠️☠️☠️ I gotta say Shane, I have been watching and following you for many many years and your videos have gotten me through some very dark times and I missed them during your hiatus.  Just glad to have you back to turn to when I need it 😭
Shane I’m dying 😂🤣🤣 that was hilarious
I want c o s p i r a c y pleaseeeeee
It is possible that those pieces that don’t fit actually do if you slid them in but the toppings are covering up the air space in the middle?
My son is 14 and he attempted last year. It was the scariest thing that's ever happened. Mental health is such an important subject. It would be wonderful to see you bring more awareness to the topic I know it's often a taboo subject so people don't speak about it often.
I fkin love you Shane 💛💛🤣🥰
👍❤️
Is the cameraman Chris your old videographer
OMG I cannot wait for the New Conspiracy video! The Scary 1 Plus The Lawsuit - PURE GOLD✨ Shane we missed you!!
When he said with 17 ads made me realized this had no ads
The Chuck E Cheese conspiracy was the best and funniest of them all. They're crazy for wanting to sue. You prob brought them so much business of people wanting to see for themselves xD
I see what you did there Shane, uploading abt Chuck E. Cheese pizza on national pizza day 😂🍕
I fucking missed Shane, he’s so funny
PLEASEEEEE KEEO DOING CHUCK E CHEESE PIZZA UPDATES EVERY SO OFTEN PLEASEEEEEE
PLEASE SHANE my favorite shirt I’ve ever found at goodwill is your merch. 😂💕 I was so excited
I think it’s cuz they cut child’s size slices that it looks like that. I worked at a pizza 🍕 place for 3 years
this is good!
I missssssed your cute lil snorts ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Please ask for one pizza uncut 😂 I need to know.
This is exactly what I needed 💜 Thank you, Shane! 🙌
Shane please never stop making videos. All of them are my comfort place❤️
As someone who works with TPE (Thermoplastic elastomer materials) I will never look at plastic the same again 😳🤣
We are more than our thoughts and can control them and stop them from happening. Meditation is great but takes practice to fully experience. EDMR treatment is also great to help with your thoughts that aren’t yours all the time . You get triggered by a smell or experience ( car beeping ) and then those remembered thoughts and words from others are turned into your perceived thoughts 💭
This video makes me so happy, and you should keep the house!
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Just another person who really really missed this. Shane, you are reaching people just by being you and doing this video. It was my first smile of the day, thanks for the little escape. Keep going
we are 100% getting sued
Mandela effect just sent me to my grave 😭😭😭😭
These are my favorite videos!  Just wore my pig sweatshirt yesterday; in desperate need of a new Spiraling but still waiting for SOMEONE to restock sizes! Love seeing you happy! ❤️
Welcome back my friend. Great content
Soooo hilarious 😂
We all know if you come out with a “T.P.E.” Shirt it’s already sold out! I want one in every style!!! 💃🏻
MORE MORE MORE
As a parent I love their pizza lol at least in my location where I go hahah and I love their salad bar lol and they sell beer for parents lol
Fucking covid boosters
not what we wanted... but what we needed
I love seeing this side of you again!! Welcome back, QUEEN 🤴🏻
I love you guys!  Senor Pooh Y Todo 🐻
A conspiracy podcast!!!! ‼️‼️🥺 yass
I am so happy to see you back!! This was so much fun!! I can't wait to see what you do next.
finally
Shane You’re such a wonderful, smart, funny, talented man and I can’t wait for the future posts and podcast 🤯😘🥺❤️
loved it glad your back!!!!
Haven’t laughed out loud like that in such a long time! Keep these coming Shane!!!!
The lil Debbie ice creams are so good!
Shane send me some left over inventory I’ll wear it cause it’s p 😁🤣
So happy you’re back! 😂
I needed Shane's humour! Been battling depression for the past few months with suicidal tendencies and Shane has played a big role in my recovery. Love, from 45.5017° N, 73.5673° W
we missed you shane! ps: i'd sell a kidney for a spooky boys reunion :(
Second comment, because of how excited I am to see this video. More videos like THISSSSS. Vlog Shane. VLOG QUEEN.
I couldn’t stop laughing 😂 and please make that TPE merch
“Made me republican! Nah I’m kidding!” LMAO IM SO DEAD
Thank god I didn’t have to scroll for hours to find something to watch… instant click
ANOTHER PODCAST!? I deadass could cry this gonna be amazing I know it
Yes Shane! I miss the podcast, conspiracy theories, etc... alot of the old content because it was amazing! We miss you
At this point Chuck'e needs to start a live overhead feed, like cctv cameras in their kitchens connected to a massive screen in the dining area with the number of the order, from start to finish so that people dont sus them out 🤣
This was such a breath of fresh air. Shane is back and better than ever baby! So glad to get to watch you create again. 🥺🥰
This had some spit ur soda out laughing moments and then some gurllllll tread lightly moments laughing at u being cancelled but still around
👱🏾‍♀️💅🏾
I missed thisssss🥺🥺😫😫😫😫
I think this definitely is a sponsorship for Adam & Eve 🤣🤣👏
i haven’t been so happy in so long 🥺🥺
Dude when you said hi chrissy.....I was like whaaa.....who me😵🤯
Definitely not what I was expecting but I loved it. Excited for the podcast! Love seeing you happy and laughing again!
80$ on 3 pizzas, Ryland! There’s no way I will ever go to California.
Love that you are back !!  Keep posting you didn’t deserved to be cancelled in the first place… we all have done things in the past we aren’t necessarily proud of.. we live, learn and grow from lessons we have gone through! Keep going you are so funny and talented !!
43 MINUTE VIDEO YESSSSSSSSS
This made my day
so glad your video is back ,
I saw a negative tiktok about Shane so I hit not interested and checked your channel and you’re here
Missed this so much - thanks, queen!
I'm glad that he's himself now Btw Shane, the pizza isn't the same because of the dull hand blades due to safety and policy reasons
Collab with Kendall Rae! She lives in Colorado too and is into true crime! Also too, I heard that Chucky Cheese has a side business called Pascwalies. Like I guess Pascwalies pizza is Chucky pizza but more expensive. It would be cool to check that out too if ur able to.
I am so excited to see what’s next!!! You guys make my week with you and Rylandadams Vlogs. I love Ryland and Lizzy podcasts and now can’t wait to hear your podcast!!! Now all we are waiting for is the Wedding 🥰
Shannnee I want to go to bed and you posting your amazing content is keeping me up!! I guess that’s why they made coffee 😂
The emma part is hilarious
I’ve been really depressed recently.. Today was bad.. This video made me smile and feel joy.. The serotonin I needed. Missed you ❤️
pushing 🅿️ it’s a song😭
I don't think I've ever been more exited to receive a notification in my life.  I'm so fricken happy!!!
pushin 🅿️
You’ve made my entire day!! I LOVE any thing you’re in! It’s like my therapy 💯
Shane your the best I would watch hours and hours of your videos!
Chucky cheese and Quiznos both have rats in their ads. Quiznos may not anymore but 20 yrs ago they used hamsters. Needless to say I never tried Quiznos. My son loved Chucky cheese but only got to go 4 or 5 times as a kid.
i cant stop laughing ive missed shane
Ryland is 1000% gonna be the dad who tells the kids no when shane says yes.
Happy you’re back I laughed several times during this lol I don’t care what people say you’re funny af
Honestly I want whatever I can get. You could literally film your dogs shitting and I’d probably watch lol. I want any and all content coming from you! Lol ❤️❤️
I worked at a pizza restaurant for a long time.  The wonky slices come from taking the pie out of the pan, cutting it with a rocker blade, then transferring it back to the pan or peel.  Happens all the time.  It would actually be MORE difficult to recycle the pizza.
YES MY LIFE HAS MEANING AGAIN SHANE IS MAKING VIDEOS 😭😭🤩😍🥰🌹👍🔥🎉🎪🤳ok sorry for YELLING I'm super pumped. Love you Shane and this video was perfect I love when your just goofing off. Welcome 🤗😁 🔙
I’m a real estate agent in Beverly Hills and would love to help you sell your house! We could film the whole process!
Shane just makes life better!! ♥️♥️♥️ I realized how much I missed him with this video ♥️♥️
CONSPIRACYS! CONSPIRACYS! CONSPIRACYS! YES!!!
I grew up on Shane, since I was in 4th grade just starting to watch YouTube all the way until now as a 26 year old woman. When I say that I've never hoped for someone to grow a bit and to come back better the way I have for him, I mean NEVER....with that said, I'm liking the side of Shane we're seeing in this video, but I really will be keeping a mindful watch for awhile of his content and how much true growth and change I see. I'm rooting SOOO hard for you Shane....please don't let us all down!
This is crazy but when i went to your instagram of the podcast the comments were at 444 and i noticed the time you screenshotted was 111
I'm soooo happy I fan see your faces here on this channel too!
I don't care if it's 🗑️🤣 I am going to eat it... Because it's dangerously good 🤭🤭🤭🤭🥴😵😵😆😁😏🥰🥰🥰🥰
Yay Shane I’ve missed you so much please post more long videos they’re my absolute favorite!!!!!
Poor Ryland this isn’t going to end well. Shane disrespects Ryland so much sometimes I think it bothers Shane how confident Ryland is and always tries to bring that confidence down idk. I hope I’m wrong because I do like Shane but the disrespect is uncomfortable to watch
Yayyyyyy!!!!
This was the best!! Put the biggest smile on my face🥰
Laughing soooo fuckin hard! I love you Shane I love this everything you’re doing
I think you should have guests on the podcast who were or are getting canceled and interview them
Love to have you back on  doing a Pod cast.. your so good at it and ver enjoyable love watching you, i THINK I GOT THE WHOLE FAMILY Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee you ryland and morgon,, can,t waite for it
It’s the P for me 🤣
Can't wait for the new podcast!
Rachet a derogatory word and honestly shows you haven’t grown unfortunately.
THANK YOU SHANE 🙏🏻
Wow I forgot how much I’ve missed these types of Shane videos. So glad you are back ❤️❤️
I loved watching your ghost hunting videos!!! And with Morgan!!!
The scream I fucking scrome when my husband told me you posted. ☠️ any Shane content I’m here for it.
Honestly such a refreshing video to see, I had a lot of fun watching this
Ok hear me out.. I think the reason why the pieces don’t align is cuz when they’re cutting it shifts or they cut it out of the box and when it moves it shifts… the half and half one they might be cutting have a pepperoni and half a cheese and place them together causing it to not fit… instead of making it like that they probably do it separately idk lol
Finally you’re back
Thank you Shane for giving content
I love this shane!!!
THE PIZZA ????
I would love a podcast from you!
Idk why but I imagine talking to Shane in person with these edits. Like I would need these visuals while talking to him. Well, not need. Im dying  3 minutes in
Omg! You're back welcome back I thought you died bro.. good to see you happy once again and joking around
Oh chuck e cheese!!  I saw a frozen Chuck E cheese pizza at the grocery store and was thinking of you!
I missed this version of Shane so much. It’s so good to have him back. ❤️
I think it’s called deadstock. When you buy a bunch of inventory that doesn’t sell
24:47 Are you 🅿️ ???????
I worked at CEC and we never recycled pizzas lmao
I just started this and already know this is what I needed today. Thanks Shane 💕
never clicked on a video so fast in my life. i’m so happy you’re back! i missed laughing during your videos
So happy to come on here and see you posted a video. Love having you back and happy Shane❤️
My humor always aligns with Shane’s love it
Ask Ian Hecox from Smosh, he worked at Chuck E. Cheese😂
Absolutely love seeing you create again!! These laid back videos are the best!❤️
Hahaha loved this as usual ! Super cute! Ran to insta to sub to podcast whatever that will be! Fun vid! Can't wait to see more ! Much love
Your videos are such a comfort for me, this is exactly what I needed today !!
We only have 1 Chuck E. Cheese in Montana and it’s nowhere near me so I’ve never been but I have to say… the slices are absolutely do not look like they belong to one pizza. But it also looks delicious?
i would loooooooove if you had a podcast
Omg I love you
Shane I know that things were awful for a long time there but I never wanted you to kill yourself and hearing that you struggled with those thoughts saddens me a lot. Please know that no one wants you gone from the world, please stay strong, things will work out💖
I've been struggling alot lately battling a lot of dark thoughts. You have no idea how much this video has lifted my spirit. Thank you for reminding me to keep fighting because things do get better. It's exactly what my heart needed. Today is the best day I've had in a while seeing you so happy and having fun means the world to me 💖
I have not laughed in like this in sooooo long. Literally ugly, belly laughing alone in my room😂 Shane I MISSED you
At this point people should get over the whole situation of shane's past and move on, like their friends/familiars would've made the same jokes back then and were forgiven but famous people don't deserve a second chance?
Shane u r literally my spirit animal. What do I have to do in order to meet u?!
shane is so freaking funny i swear
Have you ever thought of doing a comedy stand tour?? I haven’t laughed so much in one video in such a long time. Ahhh I missed you shane. You are extremely funny.
I missed these laughs!
I’ve missed your videos!! Please make more! ❤️
This man is so disgusting
Lol, I’m just so happy I get to see you in another video. Like so happy lol. Love you Shane.
OMG I love Shane's Brother, he needs his own channel where he talks about theories
Can you please take jefree ghost hunting 🙏 👻💨💥💅👄for your next video series!!
oh god.. he still has fans and supporters???
“And that’s why your still here” 😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭🤣😭🤣🤣🤣
Hey Shane, Im going through some very tough times so I just wanted to let you know that this video made me feel so much better. I love your humour and just seeing you happy with Ryland and your friends. Even though your conspiracy videos are fun, these light-hearted ones are also very entertaining to watch. Im VERY excited about your podcast and new videos that are coming. Its crazy how one minute Im thinking about the worst yet when I watch your videos Im feeling like Im just hanging out with friends and experiencing this that I never could (thanks to my anxiety). Thank you so much for coming back, many of us have missed you!
lmao this was so fun
Imagine his next video is sponsored by Chuck E. Cheese
As a former Chuck E Cheese employee, the pizza cutter isn’t easy to use and is heavy af and awkward. My pizza slices definitely looked bad
I’ll watch anything you put up. You’re so funny your humour always makes my day
SHAAAAAANNNEEE. I have missed you.
Pizza Hut does this in my town so yeh it’s gross but they won’t admit it.  Seriously though is Chuckie cheese actually gave a crap about their businesses reputation they would not make janky ass pizza they would be all over the perfection. Also they can’t sue someone for an opinion and for posting images. As long as it’s not stated as a fact (witch you wouldn’t be able to anyway given their secrecy) it can’t be libel. It’s not slander if your giving a personal review/opinion on your own experience.
Omg a fucking podcast!!!! That's it!!!!! Yesssssss come back with a come back! Let's do it!
This video made me soooo happy❤️ I really missed your comedic vlogs😊 They always make my day!
Omg this whole video was hilarious 🤣 😂... so glad Shane is back.
Not gunna, lie I'm disappointed that this video was not 3 hrs longer. Thanks for this great video, can't wait to see more from you <3
Shane you didn’t podcast for 7 years Sir. It was 2013 to 2017. That not even close to 7 years
Omg Ryland you can't just ask people why they're green
You are literally so talented, so many people on YouTube nowadays throw shitty clips tougher and call it a good video. You’re so genuine, raw, uncensored and we need more of this in today’s society, everyone gets so butt hurt so easily for anything possible it seems like. Never give up I’m so glad you’re back. Whenever you posted my friend and I literally would make a whole night plan out of it. WE LOVE YOU. Ps. Marry ryland already
This video is hilarious 😂 I haven’t laughed at a video like this in a while! Thanks Shane!
I'm just happy to see you. Haven't even barely started this video yet and I'm already so happy. It's been a shit day and I needed this video. My favorite youtuber posting is basically the best thing ever
No because I worked for uber this summer and some grow man with no kids in a house that looked abandoned ordered chuck e cheese pizza as dinner... I was creeped tf out
We love you, Shane! Even that’s what we are not expecting, we love it!
Chuck e cheese pizza slaps, I'll eat that shit up any day
We neeeed moooore!!!! Love u
Can’t wait to have you back
The pizza portion of the video 💀😂😂😂
Bruh I CANNOT believe chuck E Cheese still does this
Can’t believe it’s been 3 years since the chuck e cheese video, honestly 2019 feels like yesterday
Shane’s reaction when Chris says “tight pussy energy”. I’ve been cracking up this entire time. 😂😂
I miss all the scary and conspiracy theory videos ! Binging all the old ones !
I loved this so much!!!
Yes Yes Yes, New Shane conspiracy 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
So glad ur back I really missed ur videos n humour x
Ngl, Shane seems so much more confident in this video. It cheers me up to see him grow like that omg 🥰
This is GOLD🤪 keep posting
Yayyyyy!!!!

THE GOAT IS BACK!!!
My heart is so happy I was having the worst day too til this :’)
Never thought I’d see Shane driving. 😂

I believe that Shane and his crew is going to make Chuck E Cheeses go out of business lol.
God its great to have u back Shane🤎! I was getting really tired of replaying all of ur old videos 😂
Shane Pizza Pizza 🍕 🍕 day....
He has not lost his humor! 😆 🤣 🤣 I'm dying over here💀
I’m so happy to be back here.
You should touch on the trails that took place in the court of public opinion against our governments for their “heinous crimes against humanity” the possibility of a new world order, and the plan towards transhumanism
is anybody else confused by the combed comment section
“ We made it Chuck E” has me in bits 😭😭🤣😭🤣😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 ima wake up my family from laughing for real 19:41
You’re videos bring me true joy. I missed them I haven’t laughed this hard in a while
I like the new Shane
Welcome back Shane! We missed you!!!!!☯️💟
Wow pizza 🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕 So delicious 😋😋😋
Wait....why did the beauty room make you sad??  And im not gonna lie....i actually love Chuck e cheese pizza 😂🤷
I've missed you so much! 💗
I’m so happy you’re back we all missed you so much ♥️
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Just another person who really really missed this. Shane, you are reaching people just by being you and doing this video. It was my first smile of the day, thanks for the little escape. Keep going
You look great Shane
All I wanna say is I've missed you Shane!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️ I'm so happy now your back ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is what I needed
Shane please just upload random videos like this, they don’t all have to be thought out. Great video either way
Oh my gosh this was so much fun! I was laughing out loud so much! It was just what I need to end my day! BTW…..where did you find your Birdie clock?!? I LOVE IT!
I’ve just started watching, that guy in the beginning definitely just saw Free Man lmao
Shane I love you
Ryland with a ✨vagina✨…  I could see that lol. Love you both so much ❤️
I love when you make come backs seeing you happy makes me so happy!  Also the only thing that I could think of is maybe they cut the pizza cold before they bake it and that’s why it cooks oddly
I’m not gay!!! My boyfriend is gay!! 😏 Shane you are amazing and it’s so good to watch you on YouTube again!
I've heard the cut out the pieces that bubble up really bad and replace them with extra pieces to make it "look" better
I love that Shane is back!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
I’ve had the shittiest week and this video was a gift from above 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
I can’t wait for the conspiracy video with Jerid!!!
FUUUUUCK yeah. We all needed some more shane.content
"everyother pizza" co. legit some people just cant cut pizza.
🅿️
Do podcasts about what you love....conspiracy theories, unsolved murders, etc. I think it will be fantastic! Don't make myths podcast about the same topic! Glad you are coming back! Long overdue! Great video!
..yikes
They probably just make pizza by the slice
It took them 20 mins to put the pizza together
we missed you so much ❤️ so happy to have this video
The "yes." After he realized his spirit guides name is Christopher. I kept rewinding 😂 Love this video the Jamie lynn part 😆
omg please do a podcast!!!!
So happy to have you back! Loved this video 💗
I missed the jibber jabbers of Shane lol. One topic to the next and back lol
I heard the words penis and vagina more in this video than I've heard those words all year long
Missed this so much.
The fact that I can timeline when you filmed your videos by what cookies where at Crumbl that week lol
More more more videos plzzzz!!
YES IM SO HAPPY YOU POSTED!! BEEN REWATCHING URS AND RYLANDS VIDEOS EVERYDAY
I worked a Chuck E. Cheese and it’s because of the cutter and the fresh dough. There is a lot of technicality to that job when it comes to the pizza
The bots in the comments 😭
i think watching this video was the first time i’ve laughed in awhile, thank you shane:) i hope you keep uploading content
You as Iron Man at the end is hilarious 😂
Ryland: “Before you know, you don’t know.”  Well no shit. 😂😭
lmaooo omg this is just what I needed right now!
Can’t wait to watch nick tear this apart 😘
Haven't laughed this hard and this long for a while.i miss this channel
Shane I absolutely Love you please make more video’s like this…
I would sell the house in bel on California for the fact that you can’t even go to Chuck E. Cheese without showing proof of vaccine come on now and to top it off you paid $80 for some nasty Chuck E. Cheese pizza you over paid.
His brother was always an hottie!!
No one else thinks it's really nasty how he treats Ryland? he doesn't deserve that at all. Don't pull that "it's a joke" crap.
Loved this! ❤️
you gotta do a podcast
I was so happy when I seen this show up on my feed! I missed this!
Shane I've missed your videos so much!!! This has made my year! 🧡
This is exactly what I wanted!!
Hilarious but very missed Shane!!!! 💗
Wait I miss the crazy ass food videos too🤣
lovw uuuu
the legend is FUCKING back thank you for always being my comfort and making me feel like we’re besties. Will forever love you Shane ❤️
Uhg I missed you so much….having you back seriously makes my days better lmao
I LOVE YOU SHANE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE can we have 1 video a month PLEASE
I used to work at Chuck e cheese and while this is absolutely funny! The reason they are all mix match and don't seem to fit is bc the dough gets hand stretched before the sauce gets placed (its never beautiful lol) and once it comes out it gets sliced seconds after pulled off the belt so once it's cooled down some it stays in the place it was left (giving some gaps).  Hope this helps!
Thank you for coming back. It’s so awesome to see how much happier you’ve become.
YAAAAAAAAAAAY SHANEEEEEEEEEE😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thanks Shane
Omg I love Shane's videos. Highlight of my day
i have never clicked on a video faster, thank you for this my friend!
I love how happy you are and confident so refreshing. I haven't laughed so much at one of your vids ever
You can't even imagine how happy I was throughout this whole video. It feels like older times and it feels like home and I love that, I missed you so much :")
I loved the video, unapologetic, uncensored, and funny as hell. So glad you're back 🔙
PLEASEEE DO A PODCAST OMG <3
Not gonna lie...I still eat chucky cheese pizza 😅🤪💞
I love the relationship Shane & Ryland have. They’ve been the target of so many disturbed toxic hateful incredibly immature hypocritical people & yet managed to not only survive it all, but thrive.
I feel like this may cure my depression.    PS: I know it won't but for 43 minutes it just might 🤞
Yesss I needed this video tysm Shane ❤️❤️
10 minutes in and im already in tears from laughter im so happy you are back xxx
40:40 omg I died laughing and watched this part 5 times 🤣😂🤣😂
Is this your brother? Where does he work?
Shane we need a review of Scream 5 from you!!!
Thanks so much for such a great video this is exactly what I needed today 😊
“It’s the 🅿️ for me” Ryland I can’t😂 also so happy your back Shane!!! This has been the best YouTube notif ever for a very long time hope your doing amazing!❤️❤️
It was the "you're resting your throat you're getting ready" for me 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Shane is back! I haven’t laughed this hard in a while
I think this is my favourite shane video, I’m just in constant laughter throughout the whole video. I’m so glad ur back shane❤️
you know how you can order 1 or 2 slices of pizza at a time at some places, i feel like they do that so they just have a bunch of miss matched pizza slices. that’s the only reason i can think on why the pie is SO FUCKED UP
I used to make my pizza Dough fresh daily and whenever I would make the pizza it would come out perfectly sliced to then was 12 slices
We made it 🤭 2022
in a way like the pandemic helped cec since now theres not that much people in dine in like early covid stages go to matpats videos abt it
Can't believe we're still on the Chuck E Cheese thing XD - honestly though, maybe it's from pre-cutting the dough before baking it? (like the dough is probably pre-made and frozen, maybe they cut it up before freezing...)
The Dream with Ryland was probably due more that they are talking about having a family. Ryland  is gonna be the best Dad/Mom Ever!   Shane is gonna be a great Dad too! Relax an go with the flow ^-^
Your back!   Seriously missed your content
I didn't think I'd make it to 2022 either so I get it. ❤️
😂😂😂😂 Shane your so bloody funny
Literally thank God, I’ve missed Shane videos😮‍💨
“It’s in the beans” 😂😂😂😂
OK so the Chuck E cheese thing is probably this is what they probably do because they  Sell slices of the pizza and when somebody orders a whole pie they just take all the slices they have and put them together instead of making a whole brand new pie so this way they don't waste all those extra slices maybe that's what they do I don't know
Shane, so glad to see you posting again! I just wanted to comment about the wedding thing and say that we had such a hard time with a guest list as well because for me specifically, a lot of friends and family members jumped ship when I came out and weren’t gonna come to our wedding for that reason. I was pretty depressed about it, but honestly we didn’t even have to worry about an actual wedding like that because we got COVID and our quarantine ran into our wedding date… so we just got married in a private little ceremony and it was very intimate 🤍 We’re planning on having a reception with friends/family when cases are down, but honestly you don’t even have to do that. So many people have been having like “elopement” type weddings with just them since COVID hit. At the end of the day, your wedding is about you two being happy and as long as you guys are there, you don’t need anyone else. I love you both, and I hope you know you’re not alone with the wedding struggles but you deserve to have your moment and it’s okay if it’s not exactly what you always envisioned because the world is so different now, but you have so many people online who still love and support you guys ❤️
I worked at CEC and we never recycled pizzas lol
Legit was driving and got this notification so went into a public pull out just to sit and watch 🤤😍
This video is so so good! I laughed and got excited about the upcoming . I’m so glad to see you smiling ! 😀
I loved this video today Shane. I have a question for you. What do you think of Bryan Hahn. I find his views very offensive especially because I am gay and he seems to be supporting the enemy
21:26 omg i remember the chuck e cheese video!
Shane I'm glad that you're posting videos again you are awesome and amazing I will always be on your side Don't give up
It’s the pepperoni not matching up for me
Hiiii
Honestly any content you give is appreciated. Your videos are a boost of seratonin 🥰 watching you feels like getting a long hug from a friend you havnt seen in a long time
Shane I missed ur vids so much 😭😭🥺 🥺. I'm so happy u posted it made my day 100'/, better!!!  I wish you all the good an best things in life . KEEP GOING STRONG!!❤❤😊
why do i wanna "sssssshhhhh" them lololol
Shane im so happy your posting
SHANEEE❤❤❤❤❤
I’ve missed you Shane
Im sure a lot of people went to chuckle cheese after ur video 😂
I know I watched a video of a worker actually making the pizza, I guess. He cut it and kinda plopped it on the serving plate and it did look all messed up. But...I'm still not sure.
If you do a podcast, will you be talking about topics related to the pandemic? Y'all seem quiet about it for the most part but I'd like to hear your take.
I used to work at Pizza Hut And Little  Ceasars,  the Pizzas look like a extra piece was cook out and then make to look like a normal pizza. Trust Me
Lmao.  My daughter loves watching yall together on Ryland’s vlogs so I let her watch…. 2 min in… yeah NOPE lmao glad you are making videos again!  We’ve missed you!
I rlly needed to see this shaneeee....It made me do so many crunches den laughing that I might get abs soon😂😂
Literally just watching you eat the pizza gave me explosive diarrhea
Pushin’ 🅿️ 😎
Conspiracy pizza 🍕 Queen is back💕💓💕💓 love when you upload
I’m soo happy Shane is back!! YouTube is heading in the right direction. Now we just need Jenna back and the world will be back to how it should be.

Thank you for the laughs . I cannot remember the last time I laughed so hard. I would definitely listen to your podcast❤
I’m so happy your making videos again!!!!! Your videos make me so happy and I just think your an amazing human!!!!  Keep being awesome!!!
The best youtuber is back …never been surpassed, never will ❤️
NGL this was kinda cringe
Shaneeee thank you for this video!!! ❤️I’m always here for you
ryland calling shane’s snort a honk - SENT ME like the flying pig.
Love and missed you so much! I truly hope you start a podcast! I’m so happy for you ❤️

Ooh man these are the videos I love watching!!!! I missed them! Welcome back!!!!
I love you !!
❤️❤️
You’re a cub babe.
God ryland I feel you there on the damn wedding 🤣
I'm not crying, you are
Shane I have been watching you for years. Like.., ShanedawsonTV years. You have helped me through so much by just posting. Yea you can be offensive but they are aall jokes and i know that. You amd ryland are my favorite youtubers and I can’t wait to see more of what you come up with. Tell ryland keep spilling the tea at the sip. I love you Shane! Don’t ever doubt you are loved. Oh and hi Christopher Robin 😂😂😂
Shaaaane ❤️
You look really skinny right now Shane you should have the wedding <3 <3 <3 ily guys
That was a BLAST to watch! It does make a difference when You just want to film something as opposed to "I have to do it". It was light (except the occasional heavy theme :P ), funny, had a feeling You had fun while doing it. I'm happy to see it <3
I'm at such a low point in my life, and it's nearly impossible to not feel better watching Shane. Thank you for continuing to entertain us on Youtube. ♥
Shane is a bear and ryland is a otter
Please marry ryland he is the best and you two belong together
Chris crumbles 🤣
Isn't this the second video Shane's recently posted saying he has all these ideas for projects and that he's gonna post so much content but then he doesn't really post anything? 😕
So glad to see you’ve changed shirts since we saw you last
THIS is quality content ✨✨✨
it's just so crazy, I've been watching you since 2009/2010 and even after all this hiatus to see you Shane in a vlog makes me feel like home.. Yeah I miss past contents, sometimes even the classic spoofs or old collabs, but it's so nice to see your new phases etc. One of my favorites in the past where interactive halloween adventures and collabs with drew.
Thank you so much for this and coming back, you came at a time I needed you most, so funny and entertaining. We missed you Shane!
Lol I miss watching you !! 🤍
I started crying when I got the notification for this video. I'm so happy that you are back making videos!!!!! Been watching you since March of 2008
Loooooooved everything about this! I laughed so hard! Glad you're back... keep 'em coming!!!! 🥰❤👏👌🏆
The edit on this video is everything! Shane puts in all the little details and that’s what makes his videos so good! We love you Shane! Oh and Ryland❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
WE MADE IT 💜🤍
This is reminding me of the 73 questions with Vogue parody video 🤣🤣 miss content like this
Hey Shane!
Small family wedding in your backyard in Colorado, this summer. It would be so p
Sooooo.....Ryland doesn't know he's an otter?!?!?
Ugh, just what I needed! Hour long video from my comfort youtuber!!
please do not second guess yourself!!! I LOVE your vlog styled videos! these ARE some of the types of videos we want to see from you  (:
My dad just passed away last week. This was just what I needed
Lmao "its the p for me".. that had me laughing so hard
Is a psychic just a therapist without any sorry of credentials? Also, remember when Morgan bought that crystal from a psychic?
I LOVE that your back! I missed the real Shane!
“I’m a bicoastal, bisexual, queen” oh how I’ve missed this ❤️❤️
I’ve felt lost for awhile now. Thank you Shane for bring joy back into my life! Always will love the laughs you bring into our lives😂❤️ only love and good vibes to you my guy!!
So happy your back you have helped me though many tough times I love you Shane ❤ 😍 💗 💓 💕 💛
Shane as it has me dying 😂😂
SHANE❤️❤️❤️🙌
L lawsuit
Yippeeeeeeeee! Welcome back! ☺.  I cannot wait to see you back in your element doing all the conspiracy stuff and all the weird stuff out there. I've missed your daft self.... I'm still waiting for those babies with u 2. Keep smiling....the world needs more Shane's. 🥰
We have all missed you☺️🥲
i cant believe i usef to watch this shit years ago
Yea im so glad your back and yes on the podcast I would listen and also watch you videos so please keep posting
SHANE'S BACK <3 im so happy to see content again, especially after a bad day
Did Ryan say he paid $80 for those 3 pizzas?! A cheese and a pepperoni pizzas at that! How much is it to take the family there for dinner then?! Sincerly,one very confused aussie :)
all jokes aside.. why is chuck e cheese pizza and wings SO GOOD
god i need this laughter lol, <3
I'm trying to think of some ideas of videos I'd like to see from you. This didn't hold my attention. Maybe a cooking or baking video.
So next get a job at chucky and cut the pizza. .....
Damn! I have missed y'all!! Can't wait for more!
All that talk about the Spears sisters next to the truck and no mention of the truck being named Britney. This is great. Love all the Chris nicknames especially Chris Mas. Also, since when do pigs honk? That’s called a snort, Ryland. O’Reilly 😂 This is becoming a running commentary. Oh my God, seriously Chuck E lawsuit. The whole trip there was hilarious. “Can pizza get Covid?” “I’m not a doctor.” I also miss the ratchet food videos.
IVE NEVER CLICKED SO FAST IN MY LIFE IM SO EXCITED
❤️
Love this!
TOO FUNNY
I am watching this instead of being at my grandma’s funeral💀💀💀💀
Shane = Bear  &  Ryland = Otter (welcome back Shane) 😉
part of me feels like the pizza is cut before its cooked so it shrinks cause if it was cooked and then cut, it would have bits stuck together still
🅿️🅿️🅿️
The secret word is MARVEL
What do Yall expect from an underpaid teenage worker who probably just got done with school and is cutting pizzas with a dull circle of a pizza cutter. It’s literally just a pizza.
chuck e cheese makes me feel sick
This was the content I was waiting for. I was cracking up the whole time lol. 😂
So happy you're back 🤍
"Give us 20 minutes" proceeding to spend the next hour deciding what to wear. Hahaha.
I HAVE NOT LAGHED GENUIENLY LIK THIS IN SOOOOOOO LONG HOLY HELL LMFAOO
feels like 2019 again
This is the Shane we have always wanted and needed. What a breath of fresh air. We love you❤️
I have worked at pizza places myself and I know others who have worked at pizza places and unless they cook pizzas n sale by the slice and then decide to replace 1 or 2 pizzas on a whole pizza when a large is ordered there is no reason it should be like that even if it's the knife, the cutting board, or a machine that makes the dough and it's not circled perfectly they r not normal. Shane is also not the only one who has done videos and it's happened in many states!!!
Omg a podcast!?!!!! Yes please!
What if you get Jenna Marbles as ur first pod cast guest!! That would be everything!!!!!
shane youre the shit!
SHANE!!! Please keep giving us content! You are always so great and so damn funny!!! You are one of the best!!! Glad to see you back, hopefully we see more SOON!! LOVE IT!! In the mean time I’ll see you on Ryland’s channel!!! MARRY THAT BOY ALREADY!!! 💙💜😊
pushing "P" is a thing now i guess like means pushing pimp or cash ,, i think?
I’m gonna call u Chris.Mas. 🎄
Shane doesn't even have to try to be funny 😂😂 I literally can't
Wait.. $80 for 3 large pizzas!??? 🤯
Love love love this !! 💜💜💜
I haven’t gotten through the whole video but did anyone notice he changed he shirt?
So happy ur back! Now if when can get Jenna Marbles back 2022 will be an amazing year!!
Colorado looks good on Shane! Love these videos!’
SO READY!!!
OMG I laughed so damn hard at this video. Just what I needed today. Chuck E. Cheese is the bomb, or I should say their pizza looks like it was hit with a bomb and didn't survive.
Told my husband now he has to get me taco bell twice this week. I always eat tacos with shane and ryland!
OMG I loved this video so much,it was awesome!! Before you know You don't know,and TPE i Have to have!!...LMAO  That has to become Merch. Shane,everyone has money worries and Im sure 9 out of 10 people have thought about S.. And if she knew who you were before you showed up...Well...and if not dont look behind the curtain,Person in another room telling her everything in her ear.... Shane i Love All your content no matter what it is,You are now and have been for 6yrs now my Favorite Person,my favorite Youtuber,Now even more so because of The Love you two share,it warms my heart to watch you... Shane your having dreams of vagina's because your brain is telling you that its Bad for your health,Your mental health because if Ever,It would break Ryland's Heart.💔😿 I Absolutely Love you Two,And Chris is Awesome,he fits in so good!🤩💖
Woooohoooooo! He’s back!
You know the sex change capital of the world is Trinadad, Colorado.....just sayin'......just in case!
I really liked this Shane.(: Welcome back, really.
Shane is a cub/bear ❤️
I'd love to see a podcast feature Lori !!!
My fiancé brought home chuckle cheese the other day and it was in an entire different companies pizza box ????!!!!!!????!
WTFF I MISSED THIS SIDE OF SHANE SM😭😭💖 good job!!!🙏🏻👼🏻
Is Chucky Cheese just cutting their pizza before they bake them and also the the crust isn't perfectly round when they start?  Baking them cut could change the shape.
I love this Shane and he looks so genuinely happy. Missed watching his videos!
Oh I hope it made you Republican! 🇺🇸
this truly made me feel sm better. i missed this sm
Since when does Shane have less than 20 million subs?
This made my night🤩
I don't know how to feel. . . I want to be happy your back but I also don't know If that's a good thing or bad thing😂
This was so much fun to watch! 😊
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH
so glad you are back
Lawd have I missed your videos! 🤗
I refuse to believe it’s made fresh it must come frozen and pre cut… at least that’s what I believe to make myself feel better 😅😅
What's going on is they are cooking tha pizza fresh and when ordered half and half they just cuts another pizza and put it  together. Nothing odd or strange about it. Doesn't  take a Guinness  to figure that out.
Haven’t laughed this much in so long. So glad you’re back! Missed you dude!
This is what we needed for 2022🙏🏼❤🖤
You don’t understand how much your videos mean to us! Seeing this being uploaded just made my whole day!
I’m glad you are back!!!! 🤗🤗🤗 can’t wait for the conspiracy theory videos!!!
CEC could get into a lot of trouble for recycling pizza during a pandemic.
Everything I wanted and needed! Thank you Shane ❤️
18:38 “It’s 2022... that’s crazy.. I can’t believe... I made it.” 😂😂😂 thats the Shane dark humor I’ve missed, glad to have you back Shane!
Best day ever seeing a new post from you!!!
I had the pizza thing done to me at Papa Ginos, (north eastern local pizza place). I took a picture of it and complained to them lol.
Can’t wait for that video
This made my entire day 💕🤣 I laughed until I cried you have no idea how much I missed you Shane! Seeing you happy makes me happy can’t wait for many more evenings relaxing in my bed after long 12 hour shift watching Shane vlogs 💜 makes my day every single time
I NEED MORE!!! 💃💃💃🤌🏻💋
I’m really happy you’re making a comeback. You’re very inspiring Shane!! I see that you’ve grown and changed so much as a person so I am very excited to see your upcoming videos.
We need MORE MERCH!!!!  Loving the video, old school happy vibes!
Yes, please someone explain the P thing to me. I teach 7th graders, and they said something like this to me. I need to be in the know!
I’m dying 😭😭😭😭 “Jamie Lynn get outta my bed”
shane please make more “stupid” (they’re not stupid) hour long videos like this they’re so entertaining and i’ve been waiting all day to watch this video, i literally planned my day around it😅😅
most i’ve laughed in a while i love shane
I couldn't stop smiling the whole video ^.^ Missed you guys!!
I actually laughed out loud so many times!
I re-watch you and ryland's videos every night. I'm talking back to spooky boys. you guys bring me so much comfort. thank you for being you <3
Omggg I’m so glad your going to be posting again I literally laughed so much missed you

Whaaaaat a new video, yeiahhh 🕺🕺🕺🕺🕺
Oh my God I fucking missed you, Shane!
his videos bring me the same comfort that they used to way back when 💕 never stopped watching you shane, just been waiting on an upload 💞
Yesssssss the podcast
the way y’all protecting emma chamberlains brand
Appreciate you can be unapologetically goofy haha.   Only wish good things for all of you! And honestly.  Wedding wise. If you hate this or that… then don’t do it! It’s your day. Who GAF what ppl think.  Make it what you  want!  And if the guest list dramatically shortened  bc of whatever drama. Then you didn’t want them there to begin with.  ❤️
Yay!! I have been waiting! So glad you posted Shane! ❤
I love you Shane, always have and always will.
" we made it chucky" had me dying 😭
Resting the throat for that TPE!
You should turn the California house into like an airbnb with special memorabilia!
I loved watching this so much! It felt so nostalgic, and I'm so glad you're back Shane!
GREATNESS,!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂🤣
I could not be more excited thank you for this I really needed it especially today
The excitement I got when I got this notification! 😬 so happy you are back! Love you Shane
Shane debunks covid, that's the video we are waiting for...
Ummmmm definitely do a podcast it’s something i think we ALL need ♥️❤️♥️❤️
LOVE THESE TYPE OF VIDEOS. Miss the squad!
We love Shane here
You are so silly! We really have missed you! I can’t wait for the upcoming conspiracy video and the PODCAST 🎉
Finally been waiting for this
I hope he brings back the podcast cause I absolutely loved when him and Jess had a podcast together and I was so sad when it ended
Yesss, you should totally do a podcast again!! I'm so down for that
this has literally made my day, missed u!!
The follow up we never knew we needed!😂 Love you Chuck E.!
I miss you so much
I missed you Shane! YouTube hasn’t been the same without you 💙💜
I literally was about to type I wish you would get a pizza again and you read my mind!!!....lol 🖤🖤🖤
My god life has been boring lately . Nothing interests me anymore . But as soon as you or Ryland make a video it has me glued to the screen ♥️ forever love you and all your content
I love seeing his brother in his videos 🥰
That conspiracy jacket IS cute.
Chuck E. Cheese - the blended family of pizzas. Also...at 40:56 - what could be more perfect to be next to Chuck E. Cheese than a friggin' Urgent Care? LOLOLOLOLOLOL
Did not expect that… but loved every minute of it… I’m still sticking to Papa John’s though!!!
Is it bad that I just want the comfort of days past. Some even reporting on a sighting of jenna 😭 I don't condone stuff but I'm just tired after the past 2 years. Lost a baby. 3 family members. And a lot more. Something to remind me of the days I'd get off work and couldn't wait for a hot bath and YouTube. The docu series stuff isn't quite that time. Spooky bois time Waffle Barbie   I'm a toothbrush  Marker mustaches
I worked at a pizza place and sometimes it was hard to cut pizza but the slices would still stay symmetrical 🤣
I love you and Ryland to pieces.   My heart is so happy knowing that you are back.
why was i watching the conspiracy part of the beginning of the video and i got chills and my eyes crossed and got stuck for like 7 seconds... but anyways im so happy youre back!! keep the videos coming! <3 i love you!
Not this
Excited for your new videos!!!
So glad your back Shane!!! 💖 also maybe next time you should ask them to not cut the pizza
Yes!! I can't tell you how happy I am to see you back. 🥺❤ I watch you as much as possible in Ryland or Morgan's vlogs but it isn't the same.
Tf is this
I would love to be apart of ur podcast
DONT LEAVE US AGAIN
WOOOOO IVE MISSED YOU SO MUCH I LOVE YOU KING
Thank you 🙏 1000 x over this made my day!
OMGGGGG HES BACKKKKK
Glad you are back Shane ♥️🥰
This is what I really needed right now. And if you get sued just know it was for a good cause, My Enjoyment ☺️
Shane, welcome back. I couldn't stop laughing my god...Netflix here comes Shane :P
I love food videos. I vote yes to future vids like that 😌
The best clickbait in years!
Yasssss to a podcast!!! And if you’re in need of a host…. Heyyyyyy 😂 let’s spill the tea, babe!!!! 💜 always glad to have you back.
Omg Shane!!!! You have no idea how happy I am to see this video!  I really want to tell you my story but I don’t know how to write to you… let me know please
....a....TRUCK!?!?!?
I literally got Covid yesterday and was feeling so sad today, and watching this has lifted my spirits so much, so I just wanted to say thank you Shane for just being yourself, this video is exactly what I needed and wanted haha <3
Please come back for good! We miss you.
Watching all the ads because you deserve it
We want anyyy videos from you Shane LOL don’t get it twisted it always puts a smile on my face and a little present for me since Valentine’s was not my day yesterday lol 🥲🤣🤣
Honestly u didn’t Chuck E. Cheese a favor after that video. I feel like everyone who watched that video went to Chuck E. Cheese and bought a pizza. So there sales definitely went up. And honestly after this video they’ll probably go up again cuz I want to go back and see. 😂 so they should be saying thank u and sponsoring Shane!
Shane, I love you but- this isnt gonna work. You can't just brush shit under the rug and expect no one to notice. Clearly a lot of people have, and there are some things that need your full attention, like addressing a certain something...
3:05 proof that personality is what matters
“A mix 😏”
Looks like he has a new camera man.. 🙄
The only time I come back into YouTube is when Shane uploads a new video 💯
“Biiiiii my merch” 😂😂
i laughed a little two hard watching this
I've been a huge fan of Shane since his days doing different characters and doing music videos but Shane is gem from above idc how many times fake ppl want to cancel him I'll be here to watch his videos every single upload.... thank you Shane for the great years of exciting and heartfelt videos I can't wait for more to come and that horror movie your working on I can't for it to come a reality ik it will be great
All your videos are amazing love you and keep up the good work ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
YES A SIMULATION ONE YAY
We call our friend, Chris, "Christobelle"...he loves it.
This video is exactly what I needed today. Feels good to see your video pop up 🖤
Yes please to all of the things!!!
🅿
I think it's funny that there is an urgent care across the parking lot from Chuck E Cheese's
So glad to see Shane and Jeffree coming out with new content that is positive and back to the old amazing vibes!!! 2022 just got a whole lot better. Let’s be honest, we all didn’t see these comebacks coming like this!
Can you please order a pizza that’s not cut at Chuck E. Cheese???? Then will know it’s fresh every time
Why am I attracted to Shane ….
You are sooo skinny,look awesome.
Lmao this is hilarious
Yes!!! YouTube Gods have answered our prayers!! 😂
Super grateful that Shane cleaned the finger prints off the pig neon light
this was great
I missed you Shane
Omg. Shane you are the funniest person on Earth. I was crying laughing this entire video. Love you so much. 💗
i miss your conspiracy videos!!! we need more💗
hey shane will you do more ghost haunting?
“We made it” hit hard
Uncontrollably laughing almost choked on my food 😂😂😂
I'm so happy to see a new upload from you again!
Chuckie Cheese has frozen pizzas in grocery stores here in MI. (Thought of you) do the podcast , and start it Feb 2/22/2022 and it’s a 2wesday❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️
We missed u Shane ❤️
"i have a tight pussy, take it from me" Ryland 2022
i wanna see you go back to the queen mary! it’s under construction rn and it might be interesting to see
I took my 4 toddler daughters and my husband to chuck e cheese for one of their 5th birthdays and we got soooooooo sick. like my kids were on the couch not moving or eating for days. we all got food poisoning and the flu. it was so scary. never going there again. we are all better but took like 3 weeks almost. loved the new video!!
that was great, glad you're back and feeling happy
I’m excited I was busy all day but Now I’m in bed watching this new vlog 😊 hi Shane welcome back
For sure Ryland is high lol bro same
Little Debbie who? 😂
If you do the Podcast, i want to be in it :)
I’ve not laughed this much at a video in a long long time, unapologetically you, glad to see you genuinely happy 🥰
Just another person who really really missed this. Shane, you are reaching people just by being you and doing this video. It was my first smile of the day, thanks for the little escape. Keep going! xo
Welcome 🏡 HOME !!!!!
I so would buy merch that said tight pu$$y energy .... Just saying
oh god he's actually back
Really didn't realise how much i missed these videos and vibes Glad to have u back <3
Little Debbie's ice cream flavors tasting! That was my idea ❤️ so happy you mentioned it
Such an entertaining video. We need more of this Shane! Chicly cheese stuff is so hilarious.
I googled "Why is chuck e cheese pizza different shapes" and the first answer that pops up was this..  ""When it goes through the oven, the pizza shrinks. It warps and depending on the amount of cheese or toppings there is variation in the size and shape, hence why the slices aren’t always the same length," she said. So relax and enjoy that misshapen Chuck E. Cheese's pie without fear -- it's probably fine."   .....uhm. what??????
Shane... thank you! This video was what I needed today! I appreciate you and See the positive change in your vibe! ❤️😍❤️
Love The idea of a podcast - hope that we will see more of you real soon shane. Its good to have you back, its time ❤️
I miss the Spooky Boys videos!
Wow not this dropping on my birthday 🥳
Give us the podcast!!!
Aye Shane wussup! Been a while, I missed you! ❤
Ryland is literally a Taurus mood 😂😂 hungry and not carring 😂😂 about what other people thinks.
I have been cracking up this entire video
Maybe   they  are bad  at  making  the crust  n it  is all different  shapes ha
I gotta admit chuckE cheese and the gang animatronics scared the crap outta me as a kid.
Obsessed with your content and all the laughs fr thank you
Haven't laughed like this in a while ❤
I’m only 10 minutes in but I’ve just realised I’ve been grinning ear to ear the whole time, it’s like hanging out with friends :’)
This has always been my happy place idc
I was just thinking that maybe Chucky Cheese sells their pizzas in single slices then combine the left over slices that way.
They’re back in LA?! What did I miss??
I missed shane so much ❤️ I laughed so hard watching this 🤣❤️
So proud of you Shane! You're right, this isn't what we wanted, its what we NEEDED!! Go little rockstar.
25:02 Have a Chuck E day ya'll!
The chucki Cheese pizza  thing had me dead 😂😂
I want anything you make Shane!!!
I Love Chuck E Cheese pizza!
I missed you 🥺
You’re technically married. You bought a house as a couple
Can't wait for the conspiracy video! But this one is really funny, though. Came out just when we need it.
Ugh, I don’t miss the middle school humor
Yessssss shane we need squad videos 😩😩😩
thank god shane, btw the cupcake cookies are cumbles are actually crack.
This went from vagina dreams to pizza lol haha I love the all over the place vlogs. 💞
I LOVE THAT THEY HAVE EMMAS MUG! 🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️🤍👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🙌🏼
LETSS GOOOO
Settle this with a boxing match with Pasqually Pieplate!
I refuse to believe that there are no hate comments on this video someone is deleting them or something
pushin 🅿️ 😩😩😩
Dead set laughing the wholeeee time. “  I love the cancellation jokes, Cancellation anonymous with Chrissy, Ellen’s and JamieLynn 💀💀
😁🍕🍻🐭
I'm so sad everyone ditched you...... They werent real friends!!!! You'll have a beautiful wedding either way. Youre both stunning
I died laughing the entire time 🤣
L
YAAASSSSSSSSSSSS SHANNNEEEEE
SHANE IS BACK USE ME AS THE YAY BUTTON
Love the vido , so fun watching you all have a good time laughing. Best thing that ever happen for Shane was moving to Colorado. It seems to have such a positive effect on both of your lifes.
This is exactly what I wanted. Also now I'm getting some pizza
I bet Shane still ate the pizza after the cameras went off
Yesssss we love a white pickup truck queen 🤍 I have a Silverado!
I’m so excited for the new conspiracy theory series because I’ve been looking into how the world is a simulation and I’ve been wanting watch more theories on it. I’m excited to know that other people think the same thing…
pls pls pls do a PODCAST! i would def watch omg i love u shane
Greaaaaaaaat...
Totally "get it"! lol.... oh man... yep!
Totally "get it"! lol.... oh man... yep!
I used to work at PIZZA HUT and the pizza cutter excuse is TRASH 🗑
Shane is everything
I missed you so much
i need shane’s mom tbh how is she
Highlight of my day
something is definitely off with the pizza, you make a pizza with a flat piece of dough display the pepperonis and cheese. It doesn’t make sense why the pepperonis or pieces to not fit together, if when you slice it all the pieces should match together.
I had to look at my phone twice and then yelled Shane!!! Your back!!!
Lmfaoooooo this was hilarious af 🤣🤣
And bitch a podcast wtff I’m sooo readyyy please make it happen
Shane!!! I love you!! I'm so happy to see you making new content, I've missed you!!! I also moved to Colorado, I love it out here! I imagine you're probably west of the front range, I'm in the foothills of it on the east. I'm so looking forward to all your new content, I just think you're wonderful 💗 Ryland too, I've been watching his stuff while you were on hiatus 😊
When Shane & Morgan post on the same day!✋🏽✨ I’m NOT LEAVING my house tonighhhhht ✨🤚🏽
I literally think this might be my favorite shane video.
This is definitely what we want!!! Fun and silly Shane! I loved this more then you will know!!!
So thankful to see this
Omg. I laughed out loud the whole time.  Thank you for this!!   ❤️❤️
Love love love from Italy, missed you
Omg the outfits!!! 🤣
This was so fun to watch LMAO
omg lmao tight pussy energy lmao that has to become a thing!
Yesssss I would love a podcast!!!
Just a theory but what if they just make it all on one big tray at the beginning of the day and then through out the day cut pieces off to make a circle. Is that dumb? Idk
You know chuckie cheese could avoid this mess by cutting thier pizza into squares.. js 🤷‍♀️
I've so missed the laughs you bring.  Glad you're back Shane!
I love Shane calling chucky cheese a blended “unique” family… 😬😬😬😬
Shane I cannot tell you how happy I am to see you happy! I’m so proud of you !
YO RYLANDS VAGINA JOKE HAD ME DYING!!! 😂😂😂😂 LOVE U SHANE!
Conspiracy theories and UFOs I'm here for it! ;)
The king has returned ! 🥰🥰🥰
Just keep posting. Always love to see your content!  Whatever it is 💜
Your backkkk yessssss xx
I'd love to see a day in the life or what I eat in a day video. You know those typical youtuber trends lol
YAYAYAYAYAY. Ry would be the twink, Shane is the bear. and my name is Chrissy so when you said that i was like "Who me". lol
I've always thought that like... If we were a dream when we're "awake", then when we go to sleep what if that's the real person waking up. Or if we're in a simulation, when we're awake that's someone playing the game. But when they turn it off, that's when we go to sleep. Sorry if this makes no sense, but I think about it A LOT.
Bruh, idk what you thought I wanted but I adore this more this please 🤣😂💀
Please show Ryland some love, marry him damnit!!!
I thought this guy was cancelled? Why are people still supporting him?
When he said, “mixed” I fell OUT!  😆😆👏🏻👏🏻🐭🍕 And then Shane’s face at 32:10 🤣🤣🤣
Can anyone say what this video's about? The title isn't telling me much and I want to know if it's something I'd be interested in before watching 40 minutes. Either way, I'm glad you're still posting videos and going strong despite the Internet being stupid.
I had chucky cheese pizza few months ago and I remember thinking about Shane’s video and I think they fixed it cause our pizzas looked completely normal
I’m also sad that you guys aren’t married yet. But also weddings are stressful & the past 3 years have been very stressful so I completely understand Shane’s hesitation to have the wedding. Here’s my advice: elope.
I laughed out loud like a dozen times. Love it!
Shane is back!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
We missed SHANE AHHHHHHHH😭😭😭😭😭😭
The giant cake videos were amazing
Ooh how I have missed you Shane.
🅿️ is “pushin P” means like something good. or not 🅿️ means not good or not “valid”
💕 😍I stopped watching another video I was INTO when I saw Shane posted !  LoL
🥰🥰
Shane's children book series...morally the story all chucked chesses pizzas cometogether even in their uniquely special way.
Ryland is so supportive and such a big sweetheart!!! #tightpussyenergy
if the only problem that the pizza come out wonky is the pizza slicer, they could just try another one, because no other pizza place has that problem...
Ahhhhhh seeing a new video from you just made my week!❤️ Love you Shane and Ryland I am super excited for more videos
the judas Lynn reference 😂😂😂😂
Yessss my happiness levels have just risen immensely. 😍🥰
Yes!!! 👏🏻👏🏻 so happy you are back
I’m so happy to see Shane posting again. All of his videos are funny and entertaining, I’m glad to see Shane be happy and well. I hope to see more videos soon!!!💛💛💛
Good. Less of ryland plz .
omg stooppp i love all your videos i want to see as much as i can!!! loved this one especially, you stating your own opinion, LET THE HATERS HATEEEE when did america get so damn sensitive like honestly. be you. its perfect. keep em cominnnn
When I first read the title, I was like "there's no way it's Chuck e cheese"  But then Shane was like "👀👀👀"
Not even 15 min in and I’m laughing my ass off. Shane I’ve loved you and your Videos since I was in middle school, 27 now lol. Forever support your comedy
So happy to see you posting content! 🥰
So excited to see what Shane will create😩❤️
Btw I miss ur food videos too ❤️❤️
Please make a tight pu**y energy shirt😂😂😂 definitely would purchase😂😂♥️
I missed you so much Shane! I still always rewatch the Secret World of Jeffrey Star series whenever I’m bored!!! Best entertainment ❤️
OMG I can't wait for the podcasts!!!!!
I love you dad
This oddly makes me want to get some chucky cheese
This banter is gold
Shane’s videos just consist of him deflecting and talking about 10000 different things except the point. This could easily be half the time without his rambling. I used to find it entertaining and now I just find it so all over the place …age I guess. I can’t sit through these series even though I rewatched all his other series repeatedly. 🤦‍♀️
Shane I don’t think you understand that we’ll literally watch you babble for and hour and be entertained the entire time. We love you!
If you wanna help someone my service dog needs surgery
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ he is so good!
I'm looking forward to more frequent videos!! :)
Honestly, you do quick snappy selfaware humor best. The laidback content might be a good choice to not get into more trouble lol. Although Chucky probably gonna be coming for you again after this. Im pretty 🅿️ about it.
Next video…Ryland in the ER…lol
we made it!!
So happy you’re back!!!
🅿️!
So glad to have you back, can’t wait to have more videos ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love you, I love you, I love you, Shane ♥️ ps, I have ocd so I have to say it three times... Cause it feels right 😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💕 Glad you're posting.
Is it bad that I LITERALLY watch these videos back to back over and over and over and over? I love em. I can almost recite entire videos while listening or watching them. Lol. I listen to them while I work too. Love you Shane. Keep it up. 😉
DO MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS
I know this is weird to say. But Shane you have helped me in so many ways, I needed this.  I love you!!
Shane are you pushing 🅿️
Woo hooo! I needed this right now Shane ♥️
A Shane Dawson podcast on conspiracy theories? So exciting!
I know I’m old enough to be your mom but I’m so glad your back. My daughter got me watching u in 2017 and y’all crack me up. Keep growing and just be happy.
I’ve been sick all day this made everything better 😭💕
I missed u king
Shane has a lot of friends who are hitting the pookie for sure... the stuff he talks about... pookie hitters talk about. I can't.
My grandma recently passed and seeing this in my notifications give me life. Thanks Shane for another iconic video series ❤️😍
I miss you Shane. So so so glad your back
I legit did a spit take when Shane said “yeah because all of the guest list left us”
Literally choked laughing at "tight throat"  😂😂
Shane, you’re kinda vagina slay right now
I kinda want to see shane work as a chucke cheese employee for the day and just slice pizzas to see if there is any difference
You need to get a job there and go undercover dress up in a disguise with a hidden camera.
I don’t care what anyone says that pizza is just not right 😂
Jesus Christ...🤦‍♀️ DO NOT PLEASE I BEG OF YOU, DO NOT START ANOTHER FUCKING PODCAST. It wasn't good the first time around, podcasts are tired, everyone started one before COVID and a majority of influencers shouldn't have started one to begin with. And for the love of God fire Chris I've never seen a shakeier camera man
Keep uploading Shane!! Miss watching you!! 💗
Go on instagram, see a pic you posted a new video. I ran to the bathroom, to get my shane Dawson robe and relaxing.
I’m so excited! I swear I stay checking my phone for you🥺
So glad your back… gosh I have missed you! Never stop making videos ever ever again lol
Can't wait for nick diramio to tear this apart 🤭
thank you I love you I love you I love you I love you
God I have not laughed this hard in a while
the fact there’s an urgent care right next to chuck e cheese 😂😭
I love this vid so much it reminds me of the old vids with your friend's
This whole video is a mess
“Back in LA, let’s make people worry!” 😂😂😂 dead - awesome video Shane! So much fun, glad to see you back
One what’s going on, bhahaha
I was engaged to my husband for almost 5 years before we got married and we have been together for 12 years now and our 6 year Marriage anniversary is coming up in July And It was for the same reasons My parents got Divorced when I was really young and I was scared of marriage and I hated how much wedding gowns and the flowers and all that stuff cost and all the stress that comes with it.  so we finally just got married at the court house and I wouldn’t have it any other way! BTW I love you Shane and Ryland!!! I’m a huge fan!!!
Shane is pushing 🅿️
Shane pulling up in that truck is the straightest he has been in 20 years
SHANE I MISSED YOU!!!
Always entertaining
Please do a little debbie ice cream review
It was the baby for me !
I almost pissed my pants more than once watching this video! 😂😂😂😂😂
Shane is honestly the loml 😂
I miss shane and friends with Jesse it was always so funny a comeback would be great lol
Where can I get that kill bill shirt it’s nice !!!
Shanes videos make me genuinely happy

Shane thinking of ideas for the podcast made me think of David Rose from Schitt's Creek applying to lease what eventually became the Rose Apothecary. "It'll be a General Store, but also a very specific store".  😂🤣
this is what i need after a long day of work i’m so excited to kick my feet up and watch it when i get home🥺
I agree with Ryland, you did make Chuck E. Cheese’s business boom!
I’m sorry but Chuck E Cheese is GUILTY lmaoo
My thought is that they cut it BEFORE they bake it and that's why it doesn't match up anymore.. perhaps
Christopher Crumbl or CC for short 😂  Loved this video you seem so so so happy and relaxed 😎 😊  Keep those videos/Vlogs coming Shane 💋 xxx
This is EVERYTHING and more I ever wanted🥺🥺u dont even understand we need more videos like this PLEASE
I love when you post and it doesn’t matter what you post as long as I get to see your beautiful face I been watching you for almost 9 years next month will be 9 years😁😁😁
?
Before you know, you don't know is my new favourite thing lol so thanks for that ryland. Haha.
Hype when he mentioned maybe doing the old food videos again,  loved those videos
okay ik Shane is vary controversial and has done some FUCKED shit, but these vid topics are too interesting not to watch.
I'm just excited that you are putting a video out! Hey Shane, you had to have hurt Ryland's feeling continuing to talk about vaginas. I felt so bad for him! The look on his face was heartbreaking.
Yes I will tune in as always been a fan for years
This was hilarious 😂
Maybe they cut them before they cook them??? So they spread differently
Also love that I'm not the only old ass who has to Google wtf emojis mean to the youngins.
Can I say the 28:00 ish mark is TRUTH SIS!
The most shocking part of this video is that Ryland spent $80 on that mismatched pizza 😬
This made my night! So funny and I'm glad you are inspired to make more videos!
I remember working at Chuck E. When the conspiracy video you made came out and I remember asking my GM what Coorporate planned on doing and he said “they’re gonna sue his ass” and I was genuinely concerned that it would happen because I loved your vids but everyone that asked me if the pizza was recycled was annoying as hell
The way my soul needed this..... Make content we fucking miss you.
Why is there so much vagina talk? Oh yeah, make merch and money.  About vaginas. Great. I’m out.
Shane how do you have so much money but can't upload a video in 4k
I’ll say it. Fuck Chucky!
WE MADE IT!!!!
Honestly I have not laughed so hard I’m months!
Please do an interview with Britney Spears and please ask her about the free Brittany conspiracy theory I'm still kind of curious if she got to see her son again
I loveeee the tight bu$$y energy here. Also taking back the power from those people who burnt your merch, they thought they done something.
PLEASE DO THE PODCAST!😍
The JLS drag tho!!! Drag her more Shane, drag her more!!!!!
Why aren’t we just spamming 🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️😂
The struggles of being bisexual are real, Lol. Definitely can be tough for some of us sometimes after very long term relationships especially. Sometimes you just miss specific things about a specific gender and miss how their body felt, etc. It is a normal thing, though, Ryland, it can pass or maybe allow a certain level of openness in your relationship that allows him to be with a woman with you every once and a blue moon, so there is open communication, no lies, no cheating or affairs, and both get to explain their needs to each other. Yes there may be hurt feelings initially about some things but if you really love each other, you can work through it! I’m not saying allow someone to CHEAT on you, cheating involves being lied too and betrayed. If it is only something you do once and a while together with someone you don’t really know who doesn’t really know you, that you get together with and leave and go back to normal. Sometimes this works and gets the desire out of their system, Though in some cases this can lead to them wanting it more, so you really have to know yourself, know how much you love your partner that you are willing to be that open and honest with them b/c you want them still and that you still love them, and know that you will leave it alone after and if you do that but after you feel you can’t stop thinking about it and you’ve done everything else and tried everything else, again be honest and that can lead to either allowing them to have more sex with the other gender if you are willing to allow that or you break up. Either way, you have to be you and do what makes you happy!
i havent cried while laughing in a WHILE. That’s gold! Missed you, Shane
How am I 2 hours late for this?!?!?
Chuck E be like, See you in court Bestie! 🤪✌🏻🐭
Your stuck with me just like my stretch marks  - Shane Dawson, 2022 😂😂
If we are in a simulation then I have complaints about not being in a 5”10 model’s body who can’t put on weight  at the moment
chucky kickin 🅿️😭
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I loved this :’)
What if they make the pizza too big and they take out pieces for it to fit in the box or tray? 🤔
im so glad hes back :,(
Love you King 👑
why is he so bad about staying on topic of the video
It's always the best day when Shane uploads.  I sat there smiling through the whole thing.  I can't wait for the podcast!
Couldn’t get through this video 😖 he’s all over the place
The part where Ryland called out Shane for having cold feet 🦶 🧊 and not sealing the deal on their marriage. Then again what’s the point when they already live together and Shane’s had all the goods. 🤷🏽‍♀️ He has no incentive to get married. I’m sorry Ryland. ☹️ Three years is BS Shane.
Watching this has been the most I’ve smiled in weeks. Thank you Shane, I’ve missed you 💗
Tight! 🤣🤣🤣 Yes!!!
I am so excited for your podcast.
conspiracy vid looks dumb af. wtf.
Omg, omg, omg❕  🐖  That was so funny! 🤣 We missed you Shane! This video made my day💜💙💚❤🧡💛
“Hey what is up you guys”  I feel it comin’😌
$80????????? For 3 lousy pizzas?!?!,
I love this! Thank you for making this! It’s so well done & edited! I love you ❤️ I feel the same as Ryland! My fiancé & I have been together for 8 years, engaged for 4 & still not married. We will probably also be married by common law before actually married. We also never got past the guest list. I have super bad anxiety, so I don’t really want a wedding, I just want to get married at the court house & call it a day 😂
What if they are making whole pizza with single slices ? 🤔but that would be pretty stupid
My birthday is on Thursday, so I am going to tell myself that Shane released this as a present to me
Shane bring back your milkshake videos !! Please!! Lol those were the best !!
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Shane, I have to say I admire your resilience and courage to stay true to yourself regardless of how many times and how many people try to throw hate your way and I can see how with time you've actually found the people who truly support, love and care for you. Thank you for being you and don't let anyone ever tell you anything otherwise
“OK so this video I’m going to talk about how I was almost sued by Chuck E. Cheese, and then we’re going to cement it!!!” Shane’s spirit guide 😂
so is he gonna actually talk about the lawsuit or just sit on the bean bg nd rabmble about nothing. Shane is the worst at clickbait
I've missed this and didn't know it until today!!!   My theory on the pizza....they precut it before baking and that is why there is gaps and uneven edges....now you have your next video...you're welcome 😂
Literally just thought of Shane Dawson and thought “I wonder if he’s posted a video lately” checks and his first one in a while was posted two hours ago 😂😂
I am sooooooooo glad you are back!!!  I've missed you and your content so much.  Way to go Shane!!. 🖖 live long and prosper.
*sees shane notification, keeps scrolling cuz it doesn't register as a Shane video, goes back up to look again*
Omg I am crying from laughing so hard like literally crying!! I needed this!
im soo glad that ur back🥰
Very funny video! Loved it! MAKE MORE!!! 🤩😍🥰😘
Watching Shane’s videos feels like a privilege ughh needed this 😩🤌🏻
Wow I got so excited to see this notification pop up. Welcome back Shane.
imagine if shane got in to fnaf lore
Really enjoyed this! Absolutely hilarious!
We love you Shane! So happy your back making videos I will always support you
Haven’t had this much fun watching a video in awhile! I love you and can’t wait to see what’s next! 😍
39:54 it would be the cheese touch 😅😂
I dont know about everyone else but i appreciate the follow up. I always wondered what happened with this
Why is the person controlling me so lazy
I  think a podcast is a great idea, start fresh.
Can I just say that I LOVE Ryland so much  ! You better finally tie  him down Shane!  Love the video and the vlogs ! ❤❤❤❤
Since I was 11 these videos have always comforted me :) keep it up
i feel like shane would like Ice Nine Kills
How do you feel about Tyler Henry ?
I’m happy you shared with us !! I’m excited for your podcasts.
100% DOWN WITH REFERRING TO CHRIS AS SENÕR POOH
Love you Shane!
Painfully awkward, get ur shit together Shane
pushin p 🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️
Best thing I've seen today. I ❤ shane.
IM CRYING SHANE IS SO FUNNY IVE MISSED YOU SM
Shane I am so happy your back . You have helped me through some tough times i can't wait to see more . Love you so much
"it's in the beans!" That whole surrounding conversation was HILARIOUS. I was CRYING I was laughing so hard!
shane is still my #1 favorite youtubers. idc what y’all say.
18:38 - 19:07 I felt that, we did make it!
This is really different
sooo.... ive worked for pizza chains... most generally.. the pizza is cut with a "rocking" knife and then slid onto  a serving tray or into a box.. pieces get wonky.. also, the cheese is hot and melty.. it solidifies into the cracks sometimes creating gaps... just so you have some peace of mind.. lol
I missed u Shane so much!!!! I wish u the best blessings, and I really would suggest letting all the negative "society trained" thoughts go and be happy
idc i love watching your videos no matter what they are about I just love hearing your voice!
Yaaaaaay!
I am so excited to have a new Shane Dawson video!! Welcome back, Shane!
Missed you on your channel 🥰🥰🥰 i needed this today
WE LOVE YOU SHANE FEELS SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK ❤️💘
Maybe not the best choice to start your comeback with sexual jokes after all the controversies..
12:17 😂
I’m cracking up 15 mins into video I already am laughing so hard have tears. Never heard this much talk about vaginas on a gay mans channel before ROFL 🤣 u guys are so funny
TPE
I could not stop laughing watching this😂Felt nostalgic af
Okay I need flying pig merch on the same level as the spiraling hoodies...ooh and maybe a flying pig purse...with little flying pig icons all over it...just a thought...love that your making everyday type of videos again...LOVE
It’s so funny I just ordered a pizza right before you started talking about pizza 😂
Okay your brother is so wrong 😑
I love this
Shane wearing a shirt from Kill Bill makes me happy because it’s my favourite movie
Haven't had a good day in a long time today I laughed so much  god I missed you  Yes yes do a pod cast we miss you so much 🤣🤣🤣🤣❤❤❤😘😘😘😘😘 I
Welcome back Shane!❤️
Lmfao off! Mire of this with a side of conspiracy! Exploring
Unfortunately you lost me as soon as you brought in politics!
Didn't know that I needed this --- so very much -- until right this moment!  Brilliant and hilarious!  Still laughing!
Holy shit how can they STILL be fucking up the pizza ewwwwwwwwwwwe thats kids and  🦠 lol
Watching this has given me so many video ideas that I couldn't think of the other day on ig 🙃
I’ve been engaged for 10 years (we’ve been together for 17) and we even have a daughter together, so I can relate. Honestly, marriage is ultimately about the relationship, not the wedding.  I’ve watched countless friends meet people, marry with a huge elaborate wedding, then divorce within that time, so obviously we’re doing something right.  We are still each other’s best friend, and 100% in love with each other too. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Pog
I feel like Shane has changed for the better and is going to make a huge comeback. I miss your videos. It’s so comforting to watch because they were the only thing that made me happy at one point in my life. I’m sorry for what you went through but I feel like it made you who you are today. I hope you’re doing okay! 💗
So happy to have Shane back.  The vagina stuff was a lot but I will always show up for some new Shane content.
Uhhhh did Ryland shit himself before or after eating the pizza😳🤣🤣🤷🏼‍♀️
You 3 are hilarious!!! Keep making these videos ❤️

My childhood friend literally found a *gun* in the ballpit at Chuck E. Cheese. It was on the news and everything 😂😂😂😂😂
Yes I love you don’t listen to anyone else you’re the best post more please
The moment that notification hit I swear an angel got their wings!!!! Wooohooooo missed this shit!! Tell my queen Ryland hey 👋
Idk why I remember but I swear to God when I watched that Chuck E Cheese video years ago there was a freaking Chuck E Cheese ad at the end of the video.
Ughhhh omg my happy place is backkk
Please make more
Kid toucher
Real quick Shane, the reason it's a rat is cause when the creator of the restaurant was buying a suit for the mascot he thought it was a wolf but it turned out to be a rat. So he just stuck with it
$80 on three pizzas???!!!!! Sheesh it’s not the lopsided pizza it’s the crazy prices. What’s that pizza made out of Gold?!?! Lol
Drop the exact minute he talks about the lawsuits?? Not down for a useless video
you should call you podcast cancelled anonymous 😄
😂 please post more
My mom was “Chuckie” at Chuckie Cheese in Norristown, Pa from 1981-1986 .  She said she remembered cooks re-heating pizza that “wasn’t used/served” but doesn’t recall it ever coming from the dining area.
Yo WHAAAAT SUPRISE SHANE
Love u shane
I literally just click this video and watch while I am doing my own thing, then after I watching I checked the comments and found out its 45 mins long?! Like with! I thought its only 20mins. Shane, please keep uploading, your vids are ray of sunshine.

Shane I am sooo glad you’re making content again!! I love you and the stuff you make. While you were gone for some long I watched you’re videos over and over to try to pretend you weren’t gone. 😂
YASSSSS THE QUEEN OF YOUTUBE HAS RETURNED!!!!!!
need a time stamp for the lawsuit, its been 10 minutes  Update: It's now been 20 minutes. Still haven't heard of the lawsuit.  Update 2: So the whole bit of the lawsuit starts at 19:13 and you get hit with it until about 20:17
I really needed to hear the beautiful and unique speech... Beautiful!
Your personal growth 🥺 wow. Welcome back, Shane.
I loved this more than I should have. Such a good escape🥰 always excellent! ❤️ glad your back shane!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thank you so much! This made my day better I laughed a ton
Please call him chris crumble
Wow i have missed these videos can’t stop laughing 😂
On the pepperoni when you cut it the cheese and pepperoni slides in the cracks so that could be why it doesn't meet up side by side.  An what if stretch the dough by hand? I have no idea just glad Australia doesn't have one lol.
Hellov
Awesome video
27 seconds in and that’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard
Oh boy, this is exactly what I wanted.😂😂😂😂
Shane, if u ask a pizza without cutting…? This ensures that the pizza is new.
Sorry shane buy the camera person shakes to much especially when he's laughing alot . It's hard to watch
I saw chuck e cheese frozen pizza at the grocery store last week!
Let’s go to Disney!!! Love your videos Shane!!!
No idea why this crap was suggested but tbh who cares about a lawsuit you should be in prison and your supporters by the grace of God are all sterile
What if I don't have a voice in my head?
I don't know how I feel about Shane but I enjoyed this video
Shane is hilarious omg
Omg how come i didn't get the notif...I'm late...but omg shaneeeeee💗💗
Did he say he spent 80!!!
broke the 6th and 7th wall with this vid
F*** The Bullsh*t! Don’t let anyone keep you from what you love!
I am always waiting for that 🔔🔔...but completely 😲😳😲 it was you...but I stopped what I was doing to see what's going on 🤔🤔🤔 she's@the MET Gala...I don't even know him😵🥴💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love you Shane! I swear you could make a video of you cutting grass and it’ll be entertaining 😅❤️☺️
😩Sinor pooh😩
Welcome back Shane we missed you
I COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING
When I tell you I cried.. I cried 🥺
I want a series on you following Jeffrees new lifestyles and on the ranch!
Love you Shane!!!!
This vibes in this are thriving
this was freakin 🤣😂.. 💜
I missed these videos. I was laughing the whole time
I loved it!!!!! Thank you
I would say what people were actually calling him when they called him a P but I think YouTube would delete the comment…
Glad to see you back. Cancel canceling people.
I want Shane back Ik what he did was bad but it was so long ago bruh
I FUCKING LOVE THIS!  Please keep posting! You’re content is why I come to YouTube, x
Have a Chuck E. Day should be Shane’s new merch
Did you know that Chuck E Cheese wasn't supposed to have a rat mascot, but he was actually supposed to be a fox but when they bought the fox costume it didn't look like a fox and looked like a rat and it was too late to get a new costume so they stuck with it
This made me so happy :)
Love seeing Shane so happy!!!!! 🙌🏼🤩
I have to poop.  Goes to bathroom to make a post using "P" lmao
This is the tea sisterrr
The fact that Shan4 “threatens” us with daily uploads and knowing it isn’t true makes me a little sad. 😢
Shane has two different personality’s on rylands vlog, he’s more confident here
Naw man I missed this
It looks like they break off half a frozen pepperoni 🍕 and half a cheese 🍕 and bake the frozen halves together when you order the combo
I was thinking about you today Shane. This is crazy.
Great to see him losing weight!
YAASSS Shane I’ve been a fan since back when you were dating Lisa! (I think that was her name?) Miss you dude.
Order a pizza and ask them not to cut it
heyy, you're back! it's been awhile. 💝
I think it’s funny that there is an urgent care right behind them in frame. So if anything goes wrong your covered in the same parking lot
People can say what they want, but I Shane's videos are the best. Enjoyed this video.
I was having a sad day and now I feel ok to go get food <3 I hope you have a good week
So happy to have you back Shane!
I love this new era of YouTubers. The OG ones like Shane, Jeffree, etc. where they all took breaks and worked on their selves and made changes for the better. I’m so so happy to see Shane back. I’ve missed him and his videos so much.
Awww Shane, you better marry Ryland soon! You made him so insecure because of your vagina dream! Lol…I love you both!
Wow!   I just finished re watching the conspiracy palette series from last year. And thought  “ I wonder when Shane is going to upload next?”  then this popped up! How crazy! 😂
😂
Shane you are hilarious!! Love your videos!
You may not see this and that’s ok.  Shane, I have been going through a really rough time lately. I was forced to quit my job as a para, was rejected from 3 school districts and I’ve been very depressed. I’m on the road to a new job, and I’m scared. Watching your videos takes me away from my shit and I seriously can’t thank you enough. I’ve been an og fan since 08, and I’m not going anywhere! Thanks for everything. ❤️🥺
Bouta hit 20 mil!!! congrats shane, and keep up the good content
You don’t have to wear a suit you don’t even have to have a traditional wedding. You can wear what u want do it wherever you want don’t even need guests! Do you whatever u guys want! Just do it already cause ryland is getting insecure and you don’t want him feeling that way. Lol
WEVE MISSED YOU SO MUCH
Based on the Crumbl Cookies, I know what week this was filmed lol I LOVE Crumbl Cookies! I go there weekly 🤤
Ryland's outfit is everything I needed... can we get him a maid outfit next time????????
I wanna know how people think this acc is demonetized when I have seen 4 adds in 10 minutes
I screamed when I saw you in my feed! Love you share! Miss you so much. ❤️❤️❤️
I love your videos  I’m looking forward for more  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ love the new you 💕💕💕💕💕
Yesss!!!! Love a Shane videos
Not even half way through this video and this is the Shane I’ve missed!!! Welcome back queen! Can’t wait for the next one!
I wonder if they make an entire let's say pepperoni pizza, and even if ordered half,  they cut it and put it with the other half? I mean I worked at LaRosas when I was a kid and we made the whole pizza half this and half that. But maybe...and with them making their own dough, idk! A thought! Weirdos tho!
I got sooo excited for this I immediately texted my sister “THIS IS NOT A DRILL SHANE POSTED 🎉💖!!!!”
Went to chuckecheese last week and told my mom about conspiracy and got mad at me. She loves it.
IM SO HAPPY YOU ARE BACK .
I wanted the conspiracy theories but I’ll take this while I wait 😂
This definitely made my day!!! Shane always makes me crack up 🤣
So glad you’re back. Can’t wait to see more videos! Thank you for being one of my favorite creatures since I was young
♥️
Glad your back! As for the Chucky Cheeses pizza have you seen the Food Theory video on it? It has to do with the pizza cutter they use
I AM SO DOWN FOR THIS NEW VENTUUUURRREE!!!!!! Can't wait to listen to you!!! ❤❤❤
LOVE YOU SHANE 🥰❤️
Ffs, is it really that hard to figure out that they're not using shit that people ordered, got, and didn't eat. They are putting together the slices that were always behind the counter, but when people order by the slice. Make 4 pizzas. Individual slices are bought. Order a full pie? They take the slices that are left, put them together as 1 pie, heat it up, and sell it to you as a single full pizza.
I honestly think its like they make a whole pepperoni and a whole cheese and if someone orders a half and half they smoosh em together. Even if it was recycled I'ma eat it.
This is what I needed
Welcome back buddy❤️ we missed you!
Question: if I have my labels correctly, isn’t Ryland an otter or am I mistaken
I laughedddd soooo hard my stomach hurts its lik im the ine who ate chucky cheese pizza 😂😂😂 i love shane i dont give af wht anybody says tight pussy energy periodddddt
I’m sorry he’s just funny
I don't know if I'm ready for this . . . I'm going to watch, of course, but I'm not sure if I'm ready. Wish me luck.
finally, a new video with Shane's brother is in the makingggg
Shane I love you please continue be happy with your self and doing thing you LOVE me and all your other true fans only care about seeing you happy
it’s amazing to have you back :)
wait what
God, I love Shane and Ryland so much. Their energy together is incredible. I needed this today.
Your food videos are amazing! We'd love to see you try foods, not even wacky ones just normal stuff. Think of the food delivery service sponsorships
I once watched Jenna have a nap  for 20 mins… I’d watch you pick your nose if it means we get videos again…… Love seeing and hearing you anywhere I can❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜💙💙💙
my fav gay creator is back love u shane always loved ur vids
Missed your videos so much. Like genuinely good content and laughs. Loved this video keep making them if they make u happy. You make millions happy watching 😊
When y’all were on the phone💀
<3
I work at Chuck E. Cheese lmaoo and I promise the pizza is not recycled they have fresh dough and they cut the pizza with the pizza cutter and it is really good lol try it shane!!
You're bipedal Shane! That's another "bi" word!
THE KIDDIE FIDDLER 😭😭😭
Yayyy!!!! With all the sadness with the YouTube news that has come out recently… this was just AMAZING!! I laughed so hard and it brought so much joy to see and feel how happy you are now. Hope you continue to put out these videos cause they bring so much joy to so many!!
Look up IT THINKS by Decode Your Reality on YouTube and it explains the voices in your head
Loved this btw. You should order a Chuck E. Cheese pizza un cut.
Are you kidding me Shane!? Ryland is a Catch. Marry that man already.
I’ve missed his videos 🥲
Ryland had mad jealous energy in this video lol. He was doing a lot to try to seem cute and nice and complimentary to Shane and did not like the positive attention Chris was getting.
I broke my toe whilst in the middle of watching this
You know everything is getting too expensive when 3 pizzas cost $80
Say ‘chunky cheese tried to sue shane.’ Three times in a row fast. New tongue twister. 🙊
🐀 is going to sponsor Ryland lmao.
Just want needed to unwind 🙌  hoping he does some giveaways from that Makeup Room 🤩🤩
Senor Pooh. 💀
Haha The this is a parody when we know all of this is real
Please don’t wait another 3 months to upload another video.
DO A FUCKING PODCAST PLEASE OMG
WE MADE IT, CHUCKY!
It's weird thinking about you having sex at all.... 😱
🅿️
Some of the pizza slices are definitely adopted lol
Wasn't expecting this video
*sees notification* me: " okay , lets do that "
It’s sad how they have to tiptoe around the chuckee cheeze jokes Bc the pizza was in fact literally definitely recycled
i haven't laughed this hard in a while, thank you 😄
missed opportunity to call chris “chris crumbl”
We made it 🙌
I miss the food videos
The Pooh from Eugenia 🥰
I'm excited for Shane's comeback yay!!!
yes im watchin just to clear my head
I missed laughing this hard lol
So happy to see you posted Shane! I can honestly see such a positive change in perspective within you. I’ve been watching your videos for years and I’m so grateful you’ve pushed passed the negativity and continue showing us your amazing personality ❤️ your videos seriously have me dying of laughter! Just wanted to say thanks ☺️
You really ordered 3 large pies and didn’t even eat it 😡🤬
Shane saying the F Slur made me… uncomfy
Use me as a dislike button.
The way I laughed in this video! Welcome back Shane!!!! You truly put a smile on my face! Can’t wait for the podcast and the conspiracy video
Missed u and loves the video❤️ I WOULD LOVE A PODCAST
No but imagine being the person who got Shane or JS*'s games? Omg Tuber Simulator... :'D
As someone named Kryssi.....I loved that you told me hi!!!!
i genuinely haven’t laughed this hard in so long, missed you shane
You are the best 🥰 welcome back
When you said high Chrissy that I totally felt like you were talking to me...LOL...
Literally on one of chuckee cheeses posts they posted on their page after your conspiracy video said our pizzas are like snowflakes each one is different.🤣😂🤣
Oh Shane ❤️ loved this episode, didn’t realize I was going giggle so much over Chuck E. Cheese pizza 😆😆🙈
It's the Urgent Care next to the Chuck E Cheese for me.
Shane I promise you, I am never ever eating at Chuck E Cheese ever, and it is in fact your fault. But, I am glad you informed me before I die because of old pizza bacteria ♥️
Looking forward to the podcast, cannot wait! 😁
Is  Ryland ok?
Shane we are ALL here for your content because you are looking so damn happy and it’s amazing!  Keep living your best life and bringing us more videos like this!!!! 💜💙
Anyone else terribly bored watching this? Like I kept waiting for the intro to stop but then realized I was 30 min in.
I'm so happy you uploaded!
I WOULD DIE IF Shane gets a new podcast!!! I loved the old ones so bad and I still thrive to find some of them somewhere to listen to
You are glowing Shane…. Your self work you have done is not going unnoticed and we are so proud 🥲
This is the gayest 43 min I’ve ever watched of my life. 😂
The whole simulation thing loses me when all the horrible things in life happen. Why would that be part of your game?
Y’all switching up real fast
THE KING RETURNS ONCE AGAIN
Shane, I want the podcast and the FULL psychic reading! I'm here for it all!
Why is it that no matter what he posts it always slaps like I had to pause a couple times just to finish laughing
am just so glad that shane is back. hope he keeps posting. also, where can I subscribe for the podcast channel?????
"We made it chucky" hahahaa. I'm 7 1/2 months pregnant and peed a lil watching this video. Ahh thank u. XO
Yes! More!
okay shanecuhhhh
Love this video.
Shane acts like a girl at a slumber party prank calling a cute boy lol
a destination wedding with family only. You don't have to share your special day with the world. It will be way more intimate that way.
All I have to say....Ryland is always fuckin shit up with his stupid ass flashlight 🤣😂 His attempts at "better lighting" EVERYWHERE.....just has to go Shane...it never works.....literally makes the situation cringe everytime.... 🤣😂 Please stop him NOW!!!!!. 🤣
Shane aint pushin 🅿️
This may my day thank you so much Shane
At the beginning when they're talking about the simulation and the guy in the brain. I'm just shoveling my face with mac and cheese thinking why 😂
I think that there are psychics who truly do have an ability to tap into people but I also believe that it can only be done through the work of demons. I know that sounds extreme but it’s true. Every day we are fighting a spiritual battle whether we realize it or not. The Bible warns against sorcery for a reason, it opens dark spiritual doors and can even lead to demonic possession. Though I think a lot of psychics have good intentions, they are also playing with fire. I don’t recommend playing with them. Jesus is the only One who gives true satisfaction for the soul. Nothing else.   On another note…I love you Shane♥️ I literally prayed so much that you would start making videos again. Happy to see your beautiful face 🥰✨
We haven’t seen your brother in a while!
This is giving Malibu’s most wanted vibes
This video was exactly what I needed today. Uncensored, unapologetic, and HILARIOUS Shane. I laughed so hard I cried. It feels like home & cozy to see you again and we miss you. Keep being you!! ❤️ So excited for the next conspiracy video!
I've been waiting a long time for him to post and I've become a huge fan when I discovered him four years ago. The thing that's so weird is in all this time I have not had one single dream with Shane in it even though I wish I did and last night I finally did dream about him. Here's the kicker. I don't remember the dream.
I think what happens is someone wanted a half and half but they only had a full cheese and a full pep cooked and so they made a quick fix and put the halves together
The letter peeeeee stood for pet-o-fi*es silly goose. (Messed up spelling on purpose)
We want to see what ever you want to release you could talk stupid stupid shit about nothing and I would watch out of complete support 👏👍👌 as a straight father of 3 who is also more republican leaning (only because I belive in the 2nd amendment hard core) I belive weed should be legal my mom is gay so I belive in gay marriage my some of my favorite people alive are gay / bye anyway the point I'm making is its not what you release, its that you are who you are while your doing it the jokes the foul mouth Diggs we love that not your conspiracy videos
Ok Shane I love u but if I can give positive criticism if you could go into the video actually talking about the topic instead of wasting so much time on whatever that has nothing to do with the topic. We love your videos
I love you Shane any of your content is great !!!! Funny and please never stop filiming your the best so loved !!!!! 😍😍😍
I've missed these goofy videos!! The documentaries were cool but I love seeing you guys just have fun and do silly things and joke around🥰

Glad to have you back

I haven’t laughed this hard in a while. Thank you Shane!! 🥰💖

Shane.. thanks for being your beautiful self. Would love to have you come visit in Montana and stay at my shitty apartment!! Lol would love to take you to the lake, river, hiking and fun outdoor activities! I know you’ll never do that but what a fun idea huh? Lots of love from Montana 💜 Heather!!!!
I am so happy to have you back ♡
Can you and @joeycamasta collab???! That would be iconic
Omg I was laughing out loud!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀💀
this was truly a masterpiece, welcome back
*Chuck E. Cheese gonna bully you with a cease + desist soon queen* 😂😂😂
Omg when he said chrissy i personally thought he was talking to me lol
I love that there is an Urgent Care right behind them in the Chuck E. Cheese parking lot
Shouldnt be aloud back on the platform sinful man

Yaaaasssss welcome back ❤️
I love that you posted this,  I couldn't stop laughing! And I'd totally buy and wear a TPE t-shirt. I can totally imagine people saying "oh,  what does TPE stand for?" And their faces when I tell them! 😆 Don't let anybody take away your voice. You have so much to say,  and so much to give.  So glad to see you BACK!
what if you asked for the pizza uncut? 😏
OMG PLEAAAAASE MAKE MORE FUNNY VIDEOS IM SO HAPPY
Rocking pizza cutter + employees that don't use it properly = f'ed up Chuuck E. Cheese pizza.
I'm so happy you're back and absolutely GLOWING! I can not wait for the other video, Shane!
Shane: won’t eat that!  3am: Shane eating the pizza…
More more more I have nothin to watch please do more do more lol
Ryland don’t worry I was engage for 4 years before we got married ! I promise it happens and when it does it was worth the wait ❤️
best birthday ever!!  i get a shane video on my birthday.  this made me very happy!
This was so funny
From many many years ago I know that Shane is going to almost vanish and is not going to be famous like before . Even though I like your old conspiracy theories videos
I’m sobbing! We have missed you sm!😩 This is everything.
Shane may have said and done some dumb shit but this video is giving me so much nostalgia to simpler times and I'm happy he's back.
also i used to work at Chuck e. cheese for 6 months and we didn’t recycle the pizza but staff would walk by pizzas that haven’t been sent out yet and just eat the toppings. shit was foul
Honestly, I just love you Shane & your energy 🖤 I don’t even care what kind of videos you upload, it just brights my day when I watch. The joking, the laughing. Always so wholesome 😊
Why are y’all acting like this man isn’t fucking disgusting
Yayyy so happy to have you back Shane we missed your videos a lot!!!!!
I didn’t know how badly I needed this
Shane, you were not a “different person” back then. You were still Shane Yaw. You said those things. You did those things. Take some accountability for it, then grow from it. No more excuses.
Oh my God it's a new Shane Dawson video! Rescheduling ALL tasks for tomorrow.
Shane said I didn't want this. But he lied
so we're all watching this before chuck e. cheese sends an assassin after shane right?
VR could be a concept too
Irrelevant king
Ohhh how I missed this 💞
I need that on a birthday card  “Last time I saw you, you were a bitch… now you’re a man! Happy birthday!!” Lmao
I LOVED THIS SOOOOO MUCH.
His content is so cringey now. I can’t get over it.
them trying to figure out what pushin 🅿️ means it so funny 💀💀💀
I wanted more!!!! This video was so fun!!!! Welcome back and hope you keep it up. More fun and silly videos please!!!
Missed you Shane. ❤️
"Take off that mask" ssksksksks
Yay!!! I was so happy when I got the notification, love you shane!
hey.🙂
YES OMG I MISSED U SO MUCH SHANE💗
never would've thought emma chamberlain and shane would be in the same video
I really missed this! Just a question though about the pizza, is it possible to get it unsliced?
I literally got to comment again. That was fucking amazing. I lol'd the whole video. Missed this. I have been feeling down the last few days and I just laughed them away. Thank you.
I love the fact urgent care is behind Shane the whole time they're eating the pizza! 😂
Lololol I died at 'a mix' of crusts
Love It!
I missed you so much pls post more! ❤️💕
It’s Shane being back for me! That’s so 🅿️ ❤️ yayyyyy Shane’s back! Love you Shane!
10 minutes in and I have already laughed out loud multiple times on public transportation
YASSS he's back
24:27 not sure if intentional or not but that's Chris. He's super cute btw. 😍❤😈
had to click wdym
We needed this. I needed this. You needed this. That is all. 💕
Omg I haven't laughed so hard in a long time! I ❤️ Shane he's the funniest yet so down to earth person.
Yay! So excited to see you back again. Have missed your content.
Who else is so happy to see Shane glowing and looking happy and healthy!!! I'm so happy to have Shane back !! I missed you QUEEN QUEEN QUEEN !!!!
It was like getting a message from an old friend when I got this alert.  Super happy to see you again!!♡
Are the half and half more odd cause they make two pizzas then just give u half of them both rejoined?
cant lie, i still rewatch shane videos pretty much on the daily. his humor will always make me happier
I worked at a pizza shop and we made pizzas from scratch. I have never had any problems with pizzas being misshaped. I don’t know what’s going on there. 🤔
nah it alright dont worry yourself luv ya shane
Omg Shane you’re back! This video is pure creative shane vibes!
So fun!
Shane, what the …k , Yet I still enjoy seeing it
shane trying not to get sued through out the whole video
✨Sending creativity vibes ✨
I cry when your video is over.. I never want it to end.
I need to know where to buy that fluffy beam bag!!
Gosh I love shanes videos 🥺
Yay 😇😇😇😇❤️‍🩹🥲
Yassss shessss backkkk *mouth pop  Ily Shane ❤️❤️
Okay but cancelled anonymous would be a good podcast name
Blessed for your content
Stg I forgot ab you dude
I love how I can finally see someone who rambles just as much as me about absolutely nothing lmfao 🤣 I love every Shane video!!! We need more!
Does anyone know a video of the new pig mystery handbag bundle with exclusive so I see what I'm missing????
1:25 2:15 shane has always been goofy as fuck and I love it🤣❤
I missed you, Shane❤️ so good to see you and Ryland being happy :)
I’m so glad all of us collectively as white people have forgiven Shane ❤️
So happy to see this! Miss you!
It’s about time oh my gosh
0:27 That’s called having “intrusive thoughts” which is not uncommon. 🙃
I missed you so freaking much
Chuck E Cheese on the podcast 😂
"before you know you don't know" truer words have never been spoken omg hahaha
Never mind not cap
For real Shane, if u did another collab with Jeffree it would be just like the 1st time! Sell out in mins and crash the internet, all of it!!!!! I wish that would happen again!!!! I have the entire collection and love it! And cherish it always! I think JSC could use that too cuz they haven't been selling out since covid! And I love Jeffree and all his products, but he could use that pick me up! No pun intended and i am not trying to be disrespectful! I mean this whole heartedly!!!!!
Ryland meant “snort” not “honk”😂 and I completely understood what he was trying to say lol love you both🤍
I have never laughed at a video more ❤️ so glad to have Shane back
Shanee!! Welcome back baby!!! "it was the visiting the chuck E cheese again after almost getting sued for me" Loved the Ironman Shane outro at the end so cute! Can't wait for your next conspiracy theory video.
YES SHANE!!!!  The king of YouTube, everything you create is treasured by all of us!!!!!!!
I wonder if the pizza looks like it’s from the same pie when flipped over. Different markings on the back possibly?
Y’all watch the ads all the way through so that our boy can get paid 😎🖤💯
Can u just come back for good now please!!! I miss and enjoy your content!
I needed that so badly today. Also, go back to the play place that shall not be named and ask for the pizza to be not sliced. Or like only cut into quarters
I laughed so hard actually at The pizza scenes!
Most random video ever and I love it
Oh yay, wasn’t expecting a notification for a Shane video, but I was here for it 🙌🏼 Welcome back ✌🏼
Cap
3 pies came up to 80 dollars 0.0

I'm ready for a PODCAST!!! WE ARE ALL READY FOR A PODCAST SHANE!
I love you Shane x
Always loved ya, always will.
i wonder if the pizza is precut before it bakes or something?? i dont understand how the slices do that… lolol
Shane . Honestly thank you for being you and just not giving a poop. I dropped everything (even my donut) to watch your videos . I love you and your family ❤️ thank you
Here's something you don't want - ehm Shane you couldn't be more wrong there😂 there's nothing I wouldn't watch that you upload hahhaha
I think they cut the pizza and then put it in the oven
So excited to see you uploading. ❤
HE SAID THEY'RE SELLING THE HOUSE
Ok y is ryland in the backseat of the truck me after I eat pizza.
We’ve missed you Shane! Nobody’s perfect and we love you just the way you are❤️I’m so happy that you are happy and getting your groove back into filming again ✨
We want moreeee!!!!!! Yesssssss
Omg you come back I was waiting for so long
THE QUEEN IS BACK 👑
It’s always a special day when Shane comes through.
I GET IT HAHA
Didn't Food Theory thoroughly debunk the Chuck E. Cheese pizza slice mystery over a year ago??
All I want is for #TimDillon to befriend Shane!
i love you shane. people should give you a second chance❤️
It’s the “we have five senses” for me lmao… it just shows how uneducated people who believe in conspiracy theories are 😬 they r still fun to talk about tho
Your sense of humor >>>>€
Wait did him and Ryland break up?
I JUST LOVE YOU ALL XXOO
I've been having a hard time lately and I just laughed for 40 minutes straight. Thank you! Glad to see you back!
Love you and your videos
I was genuinely happy when I saw this notification- for Shane and me both😄 PS Ryan needs a new phone camera from the looks of his pizza footage in the car. His is terrible…
I heard your laff Shane, yep sounds like what Ryland said lol lol 😂 love it tho ❤️
Shane I’m highly disappointed that you didn’t think to call him chris crumble. You were so close with Christmas. Anyway you look great. I’m glad you’re thirty and thriving. Let’s be friends.
So blessed to have you back! ❤️🙏🏼
I needed this dopamine boost this morning
Love you shaneee!
I swear I love the comfort of this video. Like how everyone seems so chill and themselves. I missed you Shane ✨✨😊😊✨✨
I’m so happy you are back❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I know I speak for MANY when I say.. "We've REALLY missed Shane"❤❤❤❤😉
I freaking love yooouuuuuu
Glad u made video and waiting for day I run into u in Colorado that would awesome!!
The fact that it doesn’t phase Ryland is giving me so much joy.
shane is def pushin p
Guaranteed Shane has ADHD lmao 🤣 He really has so many distracting tangent thoughts and I relate so hard every time he tries to backpedal to a previous topic of conversation
I loove seeing Shane's face on my recommended! Also, side note- Shane is looking soooo fit! Also side note #2- 2022, WE MADE IT! 🥳🎉 No accomplishment is too small. . That's FACTS! 💯
SHANES BACK IM SO HAPPY!!!!
was that pizza made of fucking gold for 80 dollars
The fact that Ryland thinks the word for *Snort is *Honk was cracking me up
THIS IS SO GOOD 😂
did you lose weight?
I love you Shane, but I can’t help but feel horrible for Ryland when you tease him about the wedding. He always looks so sad when you make fun of it. 😔
Shane is trying to get a vlog on a trial or inside a jail. You´re doing amazing, sweetie!
Loved the video!!! Keep the house!!!!
you ever think they cook the pizza, cut it, freeze it and then re heat it...
This felt like the good video days. Keep em coming. This was great
Yes!! Love you Shane!
Love you. Do more videos...
The notification had me shook
❤️❤️❤️
I love this typa Shane it feels real
Damn, man. It’s nice to see him back. People suck, we all fucking make mistakes, I know I have. No one is perfect. To completely want his ass deleted off the planet over shit we thought nothing of 10 years ago, is bs.
Couldn't wait for a new video and now it's here..love you Shane..so happy to see you happy
Señor Pooh TOOK. ME. OUT!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I LOVE SHANE!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Loved it 😂🤣
Yesssss your finally back, we've missed you so much. I bought the pink pig hoodie for myself for my birthday, it's my 1st and only hoodie. Loving the preview of the life simulation video, can't wait for podcast.
As a person in gen z… I don’t get the whole 🅿️ thing either 🤣💀
So many cuts. My adhd is thriving
Yo this is funny 😂😂
I miss seeing you and Jeffree together!!! Please make that happen soon 🙏✌️❤️🥰😘
Ryland put the knife down lmao 😆😂😂😭
Not saying this in a bad way but any body else forget this man exists?
Awe Uno looks older
shane pushing big 🅿️🅿️🅿️ this year
i've laughed so man times watching this video
Everything about this 🤌🏻
i really enjoyed this, you dont know how long ive waited to just sit down and actually want to watch something. i MISS 40 minute shane videos. i would sacrifice my left a** cheek for this weekly
Omg finally a notification I’m happy about ❤️
Shane is my type of funny 😭🤣
SHANE YOU HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN AND ORDER AN UNCUT PIZZA…. Pleaseeeeee!
For real though, if we WERE in a simulation, why would the "higher-ups" let us continue to talk about it?
Been waiting like 3 years for Shane to come back😍
I'm conflicted about this.
Shane’s brother gives me anti vaxxer vibes
Omg I missed this.
Shane needs like a patreon for his podcast. Screw all those companies that just ruin people’s lives over night by firing everyone **cough** full screen **cough**
PLEASE DO A PODCAST OH MY GOD!! Love y’all🥲
Omggg I love this video it feels like Shane is officially back I’ve needed this dark humor to get me though these recent dark days
LOVED THIS!
I love that there is an urgent care right across the street haha!
I've been sick in bed unable to move all day, but seeing that you posted has officially made my day brighter.
Brb... Gotta go throw my dollar general pizza in the oven!
always feels like i’m stepping into another world with any shane series or video love them every time
Been waiting for something new. Excited 😁
Amazing didn’t realize how much I needed this
Dude I bought all 3 colors for the mystery handbag that's on sale now for $79. With a exclusive and no exclusive in any order!!!!!! I feel so scammed and ripped off 😭 I am disabled and have to buy with buy now pay later and didnt get everything I was suppose to,,
I kinda like the vibe of this video.
48 seconds in. Fuckkkk yessssssss.
You guys should just elope and then have a party to celebrate your love ✨ 🎉 🤎
Yay a video, I don't even care what its about
I love this comment section I love the positivity
I’ve missed this so much. So glad your back❤️ Love seeing you so happy❤️
I really hope you'll keep both homes... it's the nostalgia for me.
Oh you've made my day Shane!!!! Loving that you're back!!
So excited to watch this later. It feels like Christmas! Man I can’t wait till I can watch tho! Did I mention I can’t wait to watch this?! Lol
I clicked so fast my phone got confused. I missed you so much.
Always so happy when you post.  It's like hanging out with old friends.  Now don't be such a stranger! ;)
👁👄👁2seconds in I’m so fu*king excited!
the amount of people so willing to forget what this man did because he “feels familiar” is why people like this don’t learn to be better
My spirit guides name is Shane! U are MY goddess!!!!! 😘
Of course it's what we want! We just want more videos by SHANE! Of course I am sitting here not believing what I saw in this one...Chuck E Cheese? Again? And WHY are those slices so different! lol I'm just glad the one we had down the block got closed down 5 years ago!
I genuinely missed this.
Idk I'm definitely not the same POS I was ten plus years ago, and we learn that things we laughed at when we were younger weren't funny. I'm so glad to see you uploading videos. I'm here for the growth. ❤️
He's baaaack
ok slay!!!.
My mom calls it Chuck E. Disease
I’m eating a tub of enlightened ice cream and dying of laughter lol thank youuuuu 😂❤️
Bout damn time we get a conspiracy video so looking for this the only conspiracy YouTuber I watch
Omg yes Shane, I get it. Plus, so happy to see u back! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Tell my conscious to pass the controller because its f**king up.
NOT CHRISSSYYYY 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I missed this Shane
Omg I love you Shane so much!!! You are just naturally funny. I missed you making videos
I missed this so much! Eres lo máximo!
Maybe the workers are cutting pieces off and eating them and making the pizza slices all different sizes.......
YES you really released it Tuesday! I've missed your videos so much. Your guys personality and randomness really makes my day❤️
They use an old fashioned pizza cutter that’s why it’s like that
Man it's been to long but now I can see why hope everything is going decent behind all the drama I missed chilling and smoking some dank to some dawson content
"I know this is probably not what you want.." anything with you in it is what we want ! Thank you !
that's P
I’ve missed this!!😍
i‘m so glad you‘re back, i’ve missed those type of videos so much. literally comfort content 🥺
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yes yes yes 100% yes on a podcast. Omg yes. I also want a video on scary movies! You’re favorites, least favorites, reviews, or break downs. I think people would really enjoy your opinions on them!
Eres lo máximo!
Wow u drove bck to CA. Cool. Also...you look thinner shane
waiting on the daily uploads with 17 ads
I'm looking forward to Shane's conspiracy theories. They are addictive. A podcast would be the cherry on top
I am sooo happy to see you post a video i love and missed you!!! The queen is back

shane!!!! My favorite <3 I always miss you
You shoulda ordered an uncut pizza
I don't know if this means anything but Shane and my mom have the same ring tone
New vid from Shane? I always want that!
That chuck e cheese employee is lying! We cut ours the same way and theyre ALWAYS A PERFECT CIRCLE
This video was worth every minute. 😂 I need more. 2022 we made it lol I didn't think I'd make it either. Love this.
I'm so relieved that you're back. I can finally see what new and exciting content you've created ❤ I've been watching you since the beginning and always enjoyed your sense of humor and strength for continuing to move forward in life. I hope you, Ryland, Morgan, and all the fur babies are happy 🥰
love u Shane! you have got me through dark times and your so funny, couldn't ask for a better YouTuber. You are amazing keep up the great work ❤
what the fuck
Lmao that trash comment was pushing it XD
I can't wait for you to upload alien and conspiracy stuff again!
i’m hoping you don’t get sued 😭
Finelly here we have a new shane video. Miss it / You so much ! THX for this! You allways makes My Day ♥️
I was cracking up! Thank God you kept it real and not all PG. super funny!
SHANE RATS EAT CHEESE. Common how do you not realize that. I mean I get it it’s easy target to say 🐀 eat 🗑
Honestly, I needed that video today. I had a shitty day at work and as soon as I saw a video dropped from Shane I couldn’t wait to watch. I haven’t laughed so much in a long time. The video really cheered me up to a point my face muscles were killing me. Thank you!!! I can’t wait for more. Random vlog videos.
youve gained weight... yikes
Lmao “it’s the warehouse of inventory for me” 🅿️
From what I can gather it seems like almost none of the old people shane knew will hang out with him anymore for a really dumb reason . That shows true colors and they will miss out on the success.
I love you so much 🤍
Just a thought: get with Chuck E. Cheese and make a pizza and cut it. See what it looks like. 🤪
Shane is hella funny !! I’m sorry but Ryland was hella annoying for eating the pizza before it was time. Super annoying 🤦🏽‍♀️
Would love to see you have a podcast! So glad you're back!
I want pizza now. Not from Chuck E. Cheese... but pizza.
It’s almost like the pizzas are cut before they are topped and baked, so the slices rise and shrink up differently in the ovens?
Shouldve flipped both pizzas over to see the underside. You’ll be able to tell from the markings on the bottom (differing colors and patterns) -pizza cook for 7 years
This was so chaotic
Oh ew haha
Yesss so happy you’re back! this was so funny!
Guess who's back Back again Shane’s back Tell a friend…
Don't care what others say, I've missed you Shane! 💜
amazing!!!!!!!! love you
If anything you gave them so much more business!
Omggg I totally forgot about you uploading a video (I have a mom brain🤣) and I’ve been cleaning today. I finally sit down and I see that you uploaded a video IMMMM SO HAPPPYYYYY 🥲
I miss you guys so much 💖💖💖💖
Around the 10 minute mark I noticed my mouth was feeling weird/tired and then I realized it's cus I had been smiling the entire time!
The Chuck e cheese things is so fucking funny I’ve been working there and we just cut the pizza all kinds of fucked up 🤣🤣
I’m so happy ur back
Dude, I’m 100% in on the CC conspiracy. It’s legit insane
#TPE yaaaas!!!! 😝
I need the number to the sidekick
Shane ❤️
I always enjoy the content you put out! 😊
I could not stop laughing with the whole Chuck-E-Cheese bit 😂😂, so glad to see you upload again! ❤️
I was super depressed today not really feeling anything and then I saw this thank you Shane
Shane is it safe to come back lol…
It’s the world that’s catching up to you, Shane. All love! Looking forward to many more videos and podcasts :)
This was what I needed
not the O'Reilly auto parts jingle getting stuck in my head 💀💀
ryland lights on shane makes me think of kris jenner "you doing it amazing sweetie😂😍❤️
I can't wait for the new conspiracy videos love the video keep it up
Would gladly take a free “inventory” sweater lol
Chucky cheese pizza is the new taco bell wings
Shane, I would love to see you do a video about discrimination that larger bodies face.
I've gotten my family hooked on Cumbl cookies and it's all Ryland's fault! 😆 They need to be a Sponsor for one (or all!) of your channels 🍪
Loved seeing you back in such a relaxed and fun way! I was laughing my butt off the whole video!
I'm sooo happy you make videos again !!!
This was a great unexpected surprise! Missed you Shane! 🥰
Shane, you'd be considered a cub.  Ryland is an otter.
Yaasss!! Please make merch that says " Before you know, you don't know". I would buy that in a heartbeat❤️
Im genuinely so happy mr.shane dawson is back making videos
This video is everything!😂
Absolutely YES to the food videos I miss those so much!
Wow never expected Shane to make vids like this.
This was so P. 💀💀💀 (did I use that right) lol
Thank you Shane for coming back this old lady loves watching you too 💜💜💕
A simulation is one of the least likely possiblities
I Missed  You  Shaaaane💗💗💗
@Emmachamberlain  5:25  Why haven’t you gave them a PR package of your coffee they love your coffee
This made my heart smile <3
Shane is just trying to make fetch happen, and by fetch I mean cancel lol
Shane is so fucking funny.
I really live this like ‘old’ style with a new twist!
Welcome back Shane!! Love your content it is always fun and informative. Stay strong!!
MatPat did a Food Theory episode and debunked the whole Chuck E. Cheese conspiracy a year or two ago. Go watch it. They don't recycle it, they just use a janky utensil to cut it and it screws up the pizza in the plating process.
The disclaimer is TAKING ME OUT 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This was so unexpected!! Thanks Shane! I love it!!! ❤
Señor Pooh was my fav😩😂
I saw CC Pizza in the grocery store last week!  I vote for Ryland and Shane to elope on 2-22-22 - clocks ticking - better get to it!  LOL 😆
I looooove this vlogs! And I'm so excited for the new projects! 🤗❤️
I would love a shane podcast!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏 and i would buy tpe merch all day!! 💯💯💯💯✊✊✊✊
The iron Shane at the very end SENT me! 😂
Yes a podcast
Its been eren the whole time
We actually didn't want anything from you. You should honestly stop making videos and get help.
After the week I have had (hysterectomy then getting Covid the next day) this video has made me feel so much better! Love laughing with you!🤣❤️
hi Shane. Thank you for this video! Helped me maintain my sanity today 🤪
I love you so much 🥺❤️ you make the dark days so much better
Finally he’s back missed u Shane
This video is EVERYTHING.. Takes me back to the Shane we feel in love with!!!
As soon as his flat earther brother popped up onto the screen talking about simulations I clicked off lmao 🤣
Yeah no, can't, not into it anymore, it was either boring or annoying or both, just couldn't get into it. Watching the doc on him making his movie and "winning" the contest,, and seeing the real him behind the scenes and how he treated people and was so arrogant, that's all I can see now. Maybe he has changed? I'm not interested in finding out.
I missed ur vids
#freebritney
"And I put my finger in it" - that's what Chris said lol
missed you dads :)
All I can think is Jenna Marbles when she  sang, "this pizza's fucking recycled, this pizza's fucking recycled." 😂
Aww oh how I missed you ...lol
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING. GET SOME ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS.
do they not sell individual slices? maybe that’s why it comes in all shapes like they probably just end up putting the pieces together ??
Good lord, yall are chaotic. 😂😂 Also, Food Theory did a video more about Chuck E Cheese pizzas that explains better than that tweet if anyone in the comments is truly wondering: https://youtu.be/LdypKKKQ8uA
WELCOME BACKKK WE MISS YOU !!!!
Yasss! Shane i Stan !!!!! Through the ups and downs we never gave up on you and you never gave up on us! We love you welcome back bitch 😜💕
The fact that ryland called snorting “honking” is the funniest thing ever lmaooo
I could watch a 10 hour long video from you. It’s so fun to watch. I’ve really missed you.
This was hilarious I laughed out loud multiple times sitting in the dark on my couch thanks for the giggles
God I love having shame back on YouTube. Missed this so much
Future video "Ryland gets a vagina!"
How did you miss calling him “Christopher crumbl”
Yes do the podcast
Omg im so happy and excited. This is exactly what I needed to cheer up me day and honeslty this week. Shanes videos always make me feel better
NEW CONSPIRACY VIDEO IN THE MAKING? IM LITEEALLRYA SHAKING RN IVE BEEN IN SUCH A BAD SPOT FOR A WHILE AND OHGFGJFNDMHGKSJDGSJDFJGLSHDFJKGLHDSKJFGHSDKFHGSDK SHANEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Shane pushing 🅿️
Just what we wanted and needed. the 3 of you were awesome. Best video ever 🤣🤣🤣
I did a whole ass presentation on the chuck e cheese conspiracy theory haha
Who cares what we want do you Queen
I was thinking about you randomly the other day - " I hope Shane makes more videos soon, cause they're fun to watch" - wish granted!!!
It makes me so happy to see Shane happy. I love how he is so positive about his body and when he thinks something negative (because we are all human) he changes his mindset! He just seems over in a better place and I couldn’t be more happier! ♥️
Chris' nickname...Chris Crumbls, Chrisbls?? 🤣🤣....I'll leave now 🤣
How are you gonna sell that house when there’s a demon..? 😅
Shane, loved the video. Great to have you back honey.   if you do a podcast would you please video it for those that prefer to watch podcasts rather than listen only. 💋
Really not the smartast thing of u to bring up chucke cheese again but I do love you
Alright you lost me at psychic, because they are all...ALL bullshit
I miss the all stupid goofy videos btw, I still rewatch those lmfao.
its so good having him back LMAOOO
Gonna get stoned and watch this ily shaneee
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Shane, I have to say I admire your resilience and courage to stay true to yourself regardless of how many times and how many people try to throw hate your way and I can see how with time you've actually found the people who truly support, love and care for you. Thank you for being you and don't let anyone ever tell you anything otherwise
I needed this in so many ways. Love you so much Shane,  any content is appreciated and needed ❤ love you and Ryland!
I haven’t watched you in so long :(
YEEESSSSS. THE KING IS BACK!!!
Don’t scare the piggy’s like that Shane the piggy were about to team up and fight
Shane please order and uncut pizza lol and see what it looks like
I worked at a mom and pop pizza place and it's 100% the cutting and tossing into a box. It also has to do with the type of crust.
Really crapy crapy day , this put a smile on My face thank youuuu 💙💙💙
Ryland do be bringing a little toxic energy  & seems low key unsupportive of Shane getting back out there.
Finally I was just thinking about when you'd post again love youuu
wdym we don't want?  🤨 You think u know our life?  Haha, joking only! 😂🤣
Can you do a podcast on the truth of Covid
I feel like I'm just chilling with you guys I loved it as missed you so much
Miss videos like this with Shane. Can’t wait to see more! I look forward to the podcast 😊
My goodness I want a wedding with u and Ryland!!!!! 💜
This literally made me so happy.
To see Shane back, my heart needed this. 💓 I missed your videos...
Lmao its the lawsuit for me😂😂😂
Poor Ryland keeps asking Shane these questions about their relationship and Shane just doesn’t answers and laughs 😭😂💀

Was super happy to see this notif Shane!
Loved the video!! & love you 🖤🖤🖤
I love this,, thank you for making my morning <3 really great to see you making content again
I don't care what people say about cancel culture cause fk it! I genuinely believe that even though there are some harsh jokes in his video, that's what makes him unique! No need to fake perfection; just be who you are.
This is the most I’ve laughed in a while. Can’t believe your back sooo happy 🥰
Omg 😳 I’m literally about to call in sick so I can watch this 🤭🤣
the TPE merch? TAKE MY MONEY I WANT IT
This is everything we wanted!!!!!!!!!
PLEEEAASEEEE DO A PODCASTTTT
Finally a new video! Hope you are doing well 😊
Shane can literally be the Joe Rogan of the LGBTQ+ community, help give everyone a voice and a platform to have long-form conversations with any and everybody from all sorts of backgrounds. I'd tune in for sure!
Still chilling with Voldemort??
im only 10 mins in and its all just a cluster fuck, i love it lol
Wait who when what???? Baby yessss 🥰❤️
welcome back king 💕
You’re baaacckkkk!!!! *happy dance*

https://youtube.com/c/NightGod333   Since you been gone from the conspiracies?! He was your replacement for me
its 11:46 and i have school tomorrow but i dont care this video is more important
Soo happy for you Shane you’re looking so happy now!  happy to see you back I missed you! 🥲💗
I can't deal with your camera persons name. It confuses me because at the beginning I thought you were talking to me and I got weirded out.
Also when and how did you chin lipo go? I know you got it when your were younger. Just still holds up after so long
Yesss where you been homie glad to see your making videos again
I love you more for being canceled and still posting! Your value to us is alot
Sir, I still proudly wear my oh my god 🐖 shirt!!
SHANE AHHHHHH YOU’RE BACK

Shane: (taking a bite of cookies) welp. This is our wedding 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I can’t wait for a new conspiracy video 🖤 SHANE I LOVE YOU! By the way I live in Colorado and I see you going to Crumbl cookies on rylands vlog. So being a Colorado resident I googled it. There is one that is 1.4 miles from me!! Omg!!
I could not stop laughing 😂 I love these video ❤️❤️
The total chaos energy in here I love ittt. Glad you’re back Shane ❤️❤️❤️
That hat looks like a welders mask🤣🤣
So happy Chris Glossin' got to be a part of this epic adventure back to visit Chuck 🍕 🐀
I haven't laughed this much in a hot minute
WELCOME BACK KING
I missed your snorts. And you of course, duh.
Maybe they cut the pizza before they cook it, then they might cook like they don’t fit perfectly together
Love this and love your Merch!, Such a pity UK Customs charge almost the cost of the Merch again to let me have it 😔💖Great to have the videos back though 💖🌹
🅿️ushin 🅿️
I forgot you exsisted lol hi sister
Yaaasss welcome back Shane ❤️♥️❤️♥️
Senor Pooh.... I laughed so hard
I mean, this is what I miss most from your videos. Just you hanging out with your friends and having a good time. Everything else was always secondary for me ^-^
So great 😀
Rats eat cheese. 🥰
The chuck e cheese thing is so crazy to me lol. Like ive seen that they have their own frozen pizzas in grocery stores and it makes me wonder how they look bc ive never seen the actual pizza, just the boxes in the frozen aisle. Like do they look weird like the actual pizza in the restaurant?🥴
We made it to 2022! 🥰
Shane is back!!!!! Yesssss 🤩😎💙
Can't wait for inabbler to cry about you making video agains
To who ever is supposed to be my player.....STOP GETTING ME SICK BRO I DO NOT LIKE THIS KIDNEY INFECTION
No way you’re actually talking about simulation theory within the first 15 seconds!!! I’ve been waiting for this 😍
Me (an empath) sensing some tension from Ryland and Shane 👀
Yayaya
Not Shane trying to get another lawsuit 😂
Shane you could be the new Star-Lord!!! I’d watch that remake! 😍
Yay ! 🥳 missed you Shane
Shane i dont wanna diagnose you or anything but i recognize a lot of myself in u. Have you ever looked into having ADD. Just by your overthinking being distracted, depression anxiety and the way u tell a story i feel like u might have it. Maybe ask your therapist to do a test? Might help u a lot really helped me. Just dint use it as an excuse like some youtubers do :) 💋
We are not in 2016....
Finally a Shane video!!!!
The day so many people have been waiting for, I'm so happy to see you smiling and back to where you belong
I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this video and seeing Shane genuinely happy. Fkkkkk I've missed this!
💖💖💖
The notification made my night🥰
This is so weird I just watched your Chuck E. Cheese conspiracy video before this video came out  Am I psychic? Wack!
Gawd I missed your videos I never laughed so hard before exactly what I needed to after a long day at work. Please make the TPE merch
This was so much fun. The camera guy is funny lol
Adam and Eve could be your sponsor... not sure how you would talk about, test and show off the merch and stay within YouTube guidelines.
nah shane, this is exactly what we want. welcome back! i’ve missed this <3
Cameraman sucks
Love this <3
Lol! Random twangy music.
aww i’ll come to your wedding Shane.. i haven’t left you 😫💓
‘Trying not to get sued’ needs to be put on new merch 😂 Such a fun video!
I get it shane..2022 wasn't expecting me either but here I am 😂
Um you look fucking amazing ! Like 5 mins in but had to tell you before i finish watching . Proud of you 🖤
i love these vlog style videos!
I love the randomness in this video. Missed you Shane❣️
The LEVEL of excitement I had when getting a notification for your video... cant even 😣♥️
So excited for your new podcast! You are so amazing at interviewing people. I loved your old podcast and can't wait  for the new evolution of your podcast journey. So proud of you for starting this new creative chapter you are going to make so many people's days brighter including mine 💖
I am 13 minutes in and my face hurts from laughing. Thank you I needed this so much bc I was crying my eyes out not even 30 minutes ago. God I missed you. And I have a pig hoodie and hat from your collection. The pig is iconic.
This is the shane I miss, 8 year old me is so happy rn
Shane I believe that if you did stand-up comedy I would be the first in line!
why does it feel like ryland, shane and chris are turning into a thruple? lmao
Ryland just enjoying the pizza haha 😂
Isn’t it such a coincidence that there’s an urgent care in the same lot as the Chuck E Cheese’s  😂😂😂
Eloping was the best thing my partner made as a decision together. Highly support this choice. I just wore a dress from buffalo exchange lol. My 'wedding dress' was 4$ and something I wore before and still wear all the time and made for the cheapest wedding ever. Obv it can still be expensive if you want and that's cool too :) we just didn't want it to be.
I feel another lawsuit coming 😂
Omg Shane I’ve  missed you! Glad you’re back!😊
Ryland is so cute when he gets “jealous”
Return it and call in a new order. See if it's the same one.
I don’t understand why people just suddenly forget what he did
“Crooked eyes….I’m a psychic” 😅
I am so HAPPY that Shane came back i missed him 😭❤️
Exactly what we want.
I finished inventing Anna at the best time
Shane is the funniest YouTuber that I watch.😂❤️🤣
I burst out laughing so many times 🤣🤣 I love that you are creating new videos or even a podcast!!!!! This made my day ❤️
So if we’re in a simulation why is the earth flat lol
you burned one at one point 😭
glad ur back shane!! :3
The internet is officially ONLY going to be talking about this video + Shane being back … not the tired 🥱 baby announcement 📣 from she who’s name we do not say 😂
YAAAASSSS IVE WAITED SO LONG!!!!
It would be awesome if you guys could use your time in LA to visit haunted locations or murder sights and tell the story of them and go there during the night (or day) to pick up on the energies. Just a suggestion but It's always something I've wanted to see you do since you started your haunted vlog series back in 2017. Love you <3
shane love you no matter what cuz u made it in your own way <3
0:48 that’s your higher self speaking
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
thank you for this :') 🥰
Great video shane, glad that you're back doing what you love, been a fan for a long time
Omg Jerid!!!!! So nice to see him!
I will watch the conspiracy videos you make (okay I will watch literally ANY video you make), but I hope you make more like this too! I miss your old videos where you would just have fun with friends. I really enjoy your vlogs with Ryland on his channel too. ❤️
shane is one of the only people who make a 40 minute long video feel like 10 minutes.
This is the kind of content I have been missing, absolutely chaotic vlogs for fun xD Glad to see you feeling happy <3
YASSSSSSSS DADDY SHANE
love you shane!❤️
11:24 ugh, I was waiting for the “….auto parts!! OWWWW!”
Oh ryland does not like him
Liked without watching first it’s how we be😉💕💕💅🏻 You’re the shit Shane been watching for years thanks for making life a little brighter.
As a former pizza worker some times you don’t cut a straight line just happens. Also when you physically have to stretch the dough it’s not symmetrical unless you want a frozen dough disc from Pizza Hut.
Glad you’re back !!!!! 🥰🥰🥰
THE P EMOJI CONFUSION PLEASEEE💀💀💀💀💀
when i got a notif from shane i had to double take 😂 but that conspiracy looks super interesting
Am i the only one who watches shane and thinks, we'd probably make great friends.🤣🤣🤣
Fucking Eh!! So excited!! Perfect video.
I’ve missed your content Shane 🥺❤️ so happy to see you uploading again!!
I’m so glad to have you back 🖤🖤
Just watch MatPat's video lol I think he explained it perfectly.
I completely understand what you mean about not expecting to be here this long. Every birthday I’ve had since I turned 18 has honestly been shocking to me. I’m glad you’re still here, despite everything you’ve been through. I love the nostalgic feeling of this video. Love you Shane ❤️
I love this style of vlogs/videos .. just be you and have fun with it. This put a smile on my face the whole time watching :)
Love you Shane!!! So awesome to see you posting keep it up !! 🥺❤️❤️❤️
Yay!!!
YAAAASSSSSSS 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Shane, I LOVE YOU! You have a REAL gift. Never stop following your gut. You are loved and so supported! YAS queen!!
I liked the video very interesting I liked the men and black reference lol
Wait, they BANNED you from Chuck E Cheese for life?!😂
I remember wend I was a kid and we went TO THE C.C. we the lady tok the pizza away I hisssss at her and she hisss back it was the 🅿✴
Yay Shane is back!!!!
Flip the pizza over and see if the burn spots match
soooooo funny   welcome back
I think I've grown out of you.... Your videos are just like really long commercials for stuff you never actually put out. You talk about it and then it's like 3 minutes of what you were hyping up. I miss OG Shane... Hope the next video is worth the long hype video...
I laughed this entire video, thank you for uploading again. We missed u :)
Dang it I was just at Chuck E. Cheese’s and I forgot to check the pizza. Lmao. It still tasted like cardboard
As funny as it was, it made me kinda sad that Rylan had to make sure people knew Emma wasn’t sending them things or paying them for a feature. To protect her career image from a connection TO THEM. I’m sure they understand it’s a professional thing and that they don’t take it personally. Because they’re decent people who don’t make everything about them. But It just feels so weird that one of the people who helped make YouTube what it is today, someone who literally helped cultivate the kind of content that’s made so many others so rich, would need to do that.   I can’t wait for the time when there doesn’t need to be the clarification. That a connection to Shane is just that. That’s it. Not talking about it or over explaining. It just is.
Chuck E. Cheese - a little rough around the edges lol  Shane you didn’t need a psychic to tell you to do a podcast. You had Ryland all along. Welcome back thanks so much for sharing 💜
I know right I don’t know what pushing 🅿️ either😂
Love yah bestie Shane 🥰and I'm loving the video!
Soooooooo happy to see you shane!
So does that make all the people without an internal monologue NPC’s 🧐🧐🧐
You don't realize how entertaining and funny you are! Thank you!
Yay! Happy you are moving on and growing.
🤣 I absolutely needed this today! Thanks shane
Yessss ! Your back 😊
FYI...I don't think YT is feeling the love yet. Not one ad played for me during this video. 😬
Got to thinking about you today after a peaceful day and sure enough I came to your channel to watch old videos and was blessed to have come across this. Thank you ❤ Keep rocking life and have a beautiful day!
Omg the part about O’ Reilly auto parts I seriously died laughing 😂
Why do we feel pain if it’s a simulation?
Honestly besides all the drama and gossip behind Shane’s name, I kind of don’t care lmao. Because who’s business is it really to assume everything said on other people from GOSSIP sites who post biased and not FACTS on others peoples lives just because they say something slightly out of line. We literally go to school to be able to identify what’s facts and biased lol.
I'm sure I'm not the first person to think about this but if you want to make sure it's one pizza ask them to not cut it
P stands for phosphate! Lol
Shane give us moreeeeeee
I mean the jokes are funny. Visceral hate is the funniest. I can't stand the forced snorting.
our world is different right now with everything that's going on. its nice to have Shane's videos back because it provides a sense of familiarity for people who have been watching him for years. v excited for the new videos!!
I missed you, Shane! I was so happy when I got this notification! Love your content, no matter what! ☺️  And to Ryland.... Vaginas are great! You can train your muscles down there (pelvic floor)and make a man lose his mind... No wonder your bisxual partner has dreams about them... But Shane is with you! He chose you! I mean YOU had the vagina in his dream ☺️😉  No need to be jealous!  Greetings from Germany!
Love this video so much I laughed so much you, Ryland, abd Chris so made my day! Looking forward to more fun vids :)))
Omg! How I love laughing along with you!!!!!!!!!!
PLS DO A PODCAST I LOVE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF UR VIDS
I’ve missed you soooo much. My heart is so so happy you are back 🥰
This was so great! I love it all! You guys should talk to a dream specialist 😂😂 and figure out what your dream ment and film what the expert says!
2:04-2:07 💜💜💜 I love this energy
Chris needs to stop laughing via gutteral throat noises. It's so gross
I loved this, I always found you guys funny but your humor caught me off guard.   Lots of people are really stuffy and break their back trying not to hurt any feeling with jokes.
Not me ordering a Chuck E. Cheese pizza while watching this. 😏
Yasss Shane!!! We seriously have missed you and can’t wait to see everything you have coming!! 😊😊😊😊
I love that there is an Urgent Care right behind the Chuck E Cheese.
What did he get cancelled for again ?💀 I seriously forgot
Y’all are really on to something!  We keep pronouncing Chuck E Cheese.  But the sign even says Chuck E. Cheese’s.  UGH!  WHY IS IT LIKE THAT???
I’m a former witch who encountered God and gave her life to Christ. I know this is going to sound crazy but I used to hear a lot of voices directing me or putting me down or whatever as a direct result of my occult involvement. We don’t wrestle flesh and blood but principalities. I really hope you stop the paranormal videos because it’s opening you up to the demonic. There’s no way to “protect “ yourself.  Spiritual warfare isn’t how most people think it is. Superficially everything seemed good because I’d have readings or meditations that made me feel good but at the very end I looked back and realized that my mental health and the paranormal activity around me had worsened significantly… but it was so gradual and covert I only realized it at the end.  Since accepting Jesus and renouncing all witchcraft, necromancy etc all of that has stopped. My mind is a lot more peaceful. God is so good 🙏🏻
TPE is amazing!! lol
Honestly I missed Shane too damn much. I’m glad he is back.
So glad ur back ^-^ I used to watch you all the time even old videos I would lay in my room and watch them. You honestly saved me from depressed and trying to take away my life. I’ve overcome it all with ur humor and videos 👑💜
Shane was so popular for so long and then got trashed over previous popular content. Crazy. Happy you're back
Gemini’s b like😂
We all absolutely missed u so much shane I love love u
Three pizzas were 80 dollars???
I came here expecting a serious video from the title and laughed the entire time. Thank you for this Shane.
I'm happy to hear you're doing more conspiracies but I love watching any content you put out to us
HEYYyYYY welcome back
Yay more Shane content!
I LOVED THIS VIDEO! WE MISSED YOU
YAY Shane your back and I can't wait for the pod>3<3
$80 for 3 large pizzas?!
“before you know, you don’t know” - rylan adams (still not married)
Absolutely amazing 👏 I am Absolutely living for that conspiracy jacket 😍 and just in general I am so happy to see Shane making videos again.  Been a long time subscriber definitely look forward to anything you put out shane and can't wait to see more Instagram stories
P means your doing something right like people like it basically
Here before the views hit 1mil! Welcome back Shane. You’ve been extremely missed 💜
thank you shane :DDDD
Laughed so much. I’ve missed you Shane!!!
Thank God SHANE IS BACK!!!
I LOVE YOU SHANE
Why is he back
I lived with my BF for 20 years and never axed. During 2020 he brought me to town hall and tied the knot lol. I hope u guys find this happiness even if it takes 20 years.
I can believe the "it's a giant cutter and some people have trouble with it", I hit a 10 year rut where the only place that would hire me was pizza places (I've never worked for the Rat, don't come at me) so I've probably used every cutter in the industry and I've noticed a good cut pizza comes down to 2 things, training and the cutter. The problem with Chuck-E (at least where I am and hearing it second hand from friends that worked there) is the training on how to use a giant rocking cutter is severely lacking and they expect everyone to just know how to use it so if this is the reason for the janked pizza is it was speed cut by someone struggling and then thrown onto a trey or in a box where it shifts because the Rat is about speed, not presentation then I could buy it.
<3
In love with you!!! Never leave again
Been on a Shane marathon after two years of not watching  and this is the notification I get?? simulation smh
Kroger now sells frozen Chuck E Cheese pizza! 🤣
I missed Shane a lot. Every time I see a new video my stomach hurts from laughing so hard. I love it! 😁❤️❤️
Woah it’s Shane welcome back 👋🏽
💖💜💝💖💜😀
I'm sure they make them bigger for parents and their kid not a grown man lol #disneyland
I LOVED THIS!!!! Also, I literally just got done watching the last Chuck E Cheese video… Again, a couple of days ago! Thanks for the update!!! :)
P
ohh God .....u r so funny
I have an idea.. what about if you call them next time and get an unsliced pizza and see how they react😂...
I have missed you so much Shane! My late mum and I used to watch you all the time. I’m so happy to have you back :)
OML shaneee queen we waited so long for one! Hope you are feeling good 👍
Oh gosh i cannot wait for the conspiracy video. Interesting.
It's Ryland drunk in the backseat?
Chuck e cheese pizza is amazing! I love it! With the bbq boneless wings! Ahhhh now im craving it!.... love this Shane. Glad you are back!
Love everything you do Shane!! If it brings you happiness that's all that matters.
I’m so excited and ready for more uploads. I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS SHANE 💕
@9:53 💀💀💀💀💀 he did not miss a beat .
Started watching with my toddler around. Verrrry quickly had to turn on captions and turn down the volume, lol
I wish I could afford your house, I would buy it in an instant. 💙💙
WEEALLL MSS PLS KEEP PSTING MOREE
I’m so happy to see this!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
squad meet up i beg
Wait THREE LARGE CHUCKIE CHEESE PIZZAS IS $80???? 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Ryland just needs to set up the entire wedding  and tell Shane to show up. 🤣🤷🏽‍♀️ your Colorado home is perfect for a small intimate wedding no fake friends needed.
Shane looks like one of those Spitting Image dolls
Honestly, this made my day. You and ryland laughing, you looking more happy then ever. I miss you so much, Welcome Back Shane!💖
You should interview my ex-husband!!! He has a wild story , from his step dad being in the Mob, to him being in a cult, to having Burbank PD terrorizing him. His dream of making a an animated movie and the time he was homeless and slept in a gym closet. Super inspirational and interesting.
When you were selling your merchandise the website froze and I never got any  and I'm STILLL MAD I NEVER GOT ANY
Though I may not forget the things in the past and I wont support you much more than the amount I am now, I do respect you. I respect the work you put into your videos and how happy you've become. I respect a lot about you. I'm glad you and ryland are doing well (and Chrissy Teigen over here too)
I'm 10 mins in and I am soooooo happy to see Shane so happy! He's really got a new Ora about around him!!! I'm back to the show!
Shane is still funny.
thanks for reminding me to unsuscribe
Shane iron man gave me so much life. Missed laughing with you Shane ! Love u!
"I know you probably want a new conspiracy video" no we don't
Yay I'm so happy that you posted...
Sheer vulgarity in the first 14 minutes.. But, the Chuck E. Cheese part was entertaining. Definitely can’t trust them
I wonder if instead of just making a half and half pizza, they put half of a cheese pizza and half of a pepperoni pizza together. That could explain why the halves are different sizes.
I will forever love you !!
had to read that notification like 4 times
I haven’t laughed this much recently. You are so welcome back. 💜
Loved it🤭🕊🙏💜
And finally i finish my day with a smile cause Shane is back!!  Yaaaaassss!!!
My boyfriend works night shift and I always have to rewatch these with him and pretend like I waited😂🤣 only do this for you and Ryland's content. Lolol love you guys😂💕
I loved this Shane! I missed you ❤️
This video was kinda 🅿️
Oh this made me so happy 😊
why not have a small wedding with just close family?
X amount of days in Colorado* "I'm republican now, yeehaw, trucking,  and all that" 😂😂 miss you bud
In New Zeland our Chuck-E-Chesse is called Chipmunks and the mascot is named Charlie The Chipmunk.
i just cant watch this shit anymore it just seems creepy now...
I missed this so much, Shane being happy and laughing is everything. You’re amazing, Shane. Keep uploading please we miss you so much ❤️❤️
This is what I been waiting for
Proud!
I immediately stopped eating their pizza after that video and I told family and friends about it lol . Let's just say that it comes up every time we pass a Chuck E Cheese place or when we go to parties there lol.
We're eternal minds and our bodies are just avatars.
aww what happened to the old camera guy?
Omg love
I’m so happy you’re back! Bring back the conspiracy videos ♥️
🖤💜💙💚💛🧡❤
Love you so much Shane!! So happy you're back!! Can't wait foe more videos!! ❤
God no matter what Shane always ALWAYS DELIVERS ...HANDS DOWN BEST YOUTUBER!! 💙
When Shane showed that someone told him they missed his old videos, I instantly remembered when he would say in them "my boyfriend just arrived" back in the time, and now they're engaged 😭😭💖
Ugh I've missed you alot.
This title is gonna rock your haters' world lmao... just saying. So here for their anguish.
6:40 "We never got past the guest list because all of our guests left us" LOL deaaaddd 😂💀
So happy you are back Shane 💚
Please PLEASE GO TO DISNEYLAND! Idk why I’m excited for it but I just am lol.
I haven't laughed so hard in such a long time... 🤣
This just made me so incredibly happy. Thankyou
Welcome back I can't wait to see more upcoming videos can't wait to see more conspiracy videos and don't sell yourself short your videos are awesome...you should of tried the pizza 🍕🐁🤣🤣 it's really good
Y’all switched up quick.😂This is literally unsettling and sad watching a grown man with full on issues/controversies trying to stay relevant
Omg shane... Earlier today i thought about you and i was missing all the conspiracy theorie videos that you use to do and now that you say you are trying to do that and podcast again makes me so happy!😁 I've watched your videos for YEARS now and im so glad your back!
Just looks like it’s one size and if you order larger they add pieces in off another pizza
I fucking lost it when Shane looked at the camera and deadass said “A Mix”. Lol
Lol who cares if Chuck e cheese recycles pizza if it tastes good and hey, reducing food waste is a good thing 🤣
there is no explanation for the chuck e cheese pizza, like come on
Omg i dream of daily episodes!!! Sooo glad to see you smiling an laughing Shane! You're the best. We're all waitin on another vid. Love you much!!!
I'm so glad you followed up on this hahahaa I remember the video like it was yesterday
There was actually a child's finger in the pizza once. Even my grandma heard about it.
Yo I missed you Shane☹️☹️😞 I’m looking forward to more videos!!
Thank you Shane make more vids I loved the squad vids
Please for the love of god DO A PODCAST, I miss the old one you did.
Love that you uploaded a video again! Watching you from México 💙🇲🇽 💙.
Loved this sm... So happy that you are back. Loved this.
I need to know when his next video will be surfacing so I can plan my entire day around that video
Shane sounds like woody from toy story when he laughs 🤣
Bro touches animals bruh
The fugg i didnt think this was real holy its shane
Shane.  Miss you
I’m pretty sure like everyone else I was expecting Shane to post but I’m literally so happy he did 😊 Shane I love your videos and I’m excited to see the next one ❤️
I love you Shane 🖤🎧
I believe the comment about the sizes of pizza from an employee was talking about the different sizes not shapes lol how one can be a big slice and one thinner...still does not explain why some cut marks don’t match up..unless they cut each piece individually it’s not gona happen like that. Most places use and actual rolling pizza cutter like the ones you buy at the store that are round. The video you showed in your last chicly cheese video showed them using the a mezzaluna which rocks back and forth but still cuts the pizza from one side to the other. I managed at papa johns and dominoes both and the actual shape of the pizza is a huge deal, it’s supposed to be a circle. Clearly it is not at Chucky Cheese does not care about the shape of the pizza or the actual cuts. Little ceasers makes their dough in store also and their shit still manages to be round lol. When you have pieces of one pizza that are all different shapes and sizes obviously people are going to question it.  These pizzas do look 1000x better than the last ones. They look like an average pizza with some pieces moving around. The ones from the last video don’t look like they ever belonged to the same pizza at any point and time. Glad you did an update for us lol it was great ❤️
I’m so stoked that u are starting to post again! Love the vid!
I love watching your video that’s the Shane I like to see that you are yourself.
this makes me so happy, i’ve missed this… the simple, goofy videos. Don’t get me wrong the documentary style videos are iconic but this is just top tier ❤️
Shane im so excited youre back!!! And really can't wait to see what you have in store for us!!
🅿️
Start doing mukbangs again!!!
Best notification to wake up to!
Maybe you dreamt he had a vagina because you know you'd love him in any form?
he’s back!
If we are in a simulation, I'm gonna be pissed! I didn't get to customize my character! I wasn't given a tutorial! My characters body is falling apart! Her mental health has almost completely deteriorated! Her backstory is....tragic.  I want a refund of this game. I would like to speak to the manager!
$80 for three pizzas!!! Damn chuckee what a rip off oof
I mean he's only been gone for 3 months. It's not like a whole year has gone by
I loved this video . we totally love the blended family representation that Chuck e cheese gives us 🤣 .  also if u do the podcast can u do video/visual as well as audio.   I watch the sip like on YouTube and I'd do the same with yours.  I'm so excited!!!!!!!
Y’all should just get eloped seems more yalls style
Did you literally just spend an entire video making offensive jokes immediately after saying you had self-reflected, changed, fixed yourself, and had moved on from that sort of stuff? You're living proof that canceling doesn't work because people with enough money never change. Also really cool exposing someone else's mental health issues for views, we love to see you continue your long legacy of exploitative content for financial gain.
I am here for this💕
Anyone else notice the Urgent Care right across the parking lot from Chuck E's? Hahahahaha! Great video, Shane!
Welcome back king ♥️ missed your videos so much
I used to work at a pizza place and when the conspiracy first came out I transferred a pizza into the box after cutting and it got f*caked up 😂 some aren’t perfectly circular and the cuts aren’t always through the exact middle so some pieces don’t slide back into place after being shifted  I looked at my coworker and said maybe I should go work for Chuck E Cheese 😂😂
If you cut a pizza while its hot the pieces could cool down and change shape due to losing heat maybe possible perhaps
omg, that was so much fun to watch. I laughed like crazy. good vibes Shane. Can't wait for more.
Everbodys else  when thet saw shane Dawson's New truck👀👀👀👀👀👀👀. Me. That's hot. Lmao
Disney vloooooog
Love that you are making videos again❤️
I missed you so much!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Shane <33
Awesome!! 👏 👏 👏  LMAO!!!
I miss these videos from you. I can tell that you were having a good time and enjoying yourself. I love the documentaries but I can see how happy these types of videos make you happy. I’d love to see Disneyland vlog from you.
Was not expecting to get that notification 😳
Look who’s back!!
is shane high LMAO
Who is your favorite youtuber
Lol I ment "live this long" oops
Welcome back!
Weird question....but can I have the couch in your garage??🤭🤭
This made my heart so happy :')
I just wanna say you’re amazing Shane and I love ya I’m glad you decided to continue making content
Dang it i was wait for the sell the LA house and go start a family arch!!
THE PHOTO AT 37:17 HAHAH
Oh how I’ve missed you !
i love this, thank you shane, glad to have you back!!!
You made a whole brand out of pigs! 😂  The pig slides are literally my every day shoe.  I’m going to be so sad if something happens to them. They need to have a restock!!!!!!
I’m dying at the fact that there is an Urgent Care directly behind you 🤣 while Ryland is eating the pizza 🤣🤣
Omg! I'm think I peed a little. Ok I did pee in excitement. I was having a stressful day, work, my husband, ect. And then notifications hit SHANE DAWSON UPLOADED A VIDEO. Happy Happy Joy joy!!!!! @ShaneDawson you bring me so much joy.
Lmfao instead of chuckle cheese its a pig 🤣😭😂
1:17 the iconic Shane Dawson smile we have all been waiting for ❤️
I miss this so much. Shane your videos make me so happy, they have since the start <3
I'm not trying to be rude or hurt your feelings in any way I really love you and enjoy your videos. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I just felt kind of disappointed especially after such a long break. I was really hoping you had taken the time to self-reflect and humble yourself. I've been enjoying your video since the beginning. I was just hoping four more of an evolution of the channel or at least for you to have matured in the way you act and talk during your videos. I'm your age and now it's kind of unbearable to watch your videos because I feel like I'm watching a 12 year old, which only seems to make me feel uncomfortable. I'm not trying to hurt your feelings and I know it's none of my business and I probably shouldn't have said anyting. I'm sure I'll be back later to delete this.
1st: I think that you're going to have a daughter one day. 2nd: you could get married at your la house ASAP just to say goodbye in a proper way, like a ranch wedding 3rd: love all of your ideas
This is the content. Go off sis ❤️🐷
Shanes comedic timing is 👩‍🍳😘
That was a nice surprise (both the vid and the podcast announcement) and I'm so excited! I miss your podcast!!. I found so many interesting people thru your podcasts (& videos) over the years -  its so entertaining to see you talk to someone you're interested in, your excitement beams out and it makes for a unique, funny & very enjoyable time. I find your view of life very interesting! - I wonder if you'll film it and post in in YT this time?! - I feel like you have a knack for it (I recall watching you interview even the people trying to interview You! :D). It seems like this will be an amazing year for you , and you just made 2022 better for us watching too. But above all, continue to enjoy the ride and have fun :))
Yay you are back. ♥︎♥︎♥︎
I miss youuuuuuu qweeen
Look! I don’t have any expectations from you. I will watch WHATEVER you post!  You crack me up so much, you make everything you film so much fun!  Thank you for being you! 🥰🤗
HELL YEAH! the return of the pig queen. Woop woop. SHANE IS BACK BITCH. so excite
Rylan, just plan a party with all your friends and family. And then, "Surprise!" It's your wedding!
Señor Pooh 😂💀  LOVE IT!
OMG IM SO EXCITED 😆 UR AWESOME!!
welcome back queen
so glad u posted!!
We made it we made it to 2022! Like I did not expect to like this long and I am so so happy your back Shane we missed you!😢😘😭
I wasn’t laughing at school the whole time. I turn on this video and im dying of laughter. Thank you. This made my day <3
It’s been so long sense I’ve felt ok watching Shane due to a very toxic friend forcing me to not do certain things and oh boy did I miss this content
SEÑOR POOH AHAHAHAHAH  IM SO GLAD YOURE BACK
The simulation theory...truth. your "conscience" "gut instint"...the one with the controller...thats your higher self and or your guides. You pick those closest to you b4 you enter the simulation to guide you. You create the outline. This is a soul school simulation so you can grow and release karmic debts. We are immortal beings having a mortal experience.
Who thinks shane should do a follow up on his conspiracy theory about walmarts being turned into fema camps?
Shane I have missed your vlogs and videos soooooooo much!!!!!
love seeing you again! I usually don't comment on videos, but watching your video really made me happy. Keep going! Looking forward to seeing stuff like this in the future. And I'm also really excited about the conspiracy video (and maybe even Podcast??) :D hope you had a great day, you definitely made mine better <3
I want to see Shane go on the BFF’s pod with Dave portnoy and josh Richards I feel like that would just be so interesting since josh probably watched Shane at one point and Shane has been so out of the loop with social media josh could catch him up idk I feel like that would be an interesting episode 🤔
Luv these laid back videos. U guys r funny. I think if anything Shane made business great for Chuck e cheese. So many people were ordering pizzas to see if they'd come out normal. & Let's face it the same greasy eaters that ate that pizza before are still eating it.
I’ve missed you 😭
Ryland saying “preach brother”
I’m smiling and laughing through out this video! 😄♥️ I love that you are back! Missed you sooo much ♥️
The urgent care in the background was 👩‍🍳 💋
I have a feeling it's the way they make the dough like they dont want to make it circle but still doesn't match up so I don't know 😆😆
Livinggggg we’ve missed you dad
So was Shane Sued by chucke?
11:25 , 11:26 … 🎶 AUTO PARTS!!! 🎼 I am sooo triggered that you did not complete the song! Gahhhh!!!! Lololol💜
@Shane Dawson I think that when they do their pizza bars upfront where you can just go up there and order a slice or two inside. We'll, it's probably what they didn't use from the bar then put the random slices together. It's not that they're grabbing it from other people's plates from the tables,  but I do think they're using slices from the pizza bar. Btw so happy to see you back! Can't wait to see some real crazy conspiracy theories! It was my favorite topics of your videos!! Miss you Shane!! 😘
This video was 🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️
So happy you're back!
I’ve been waiting for you to post since the last upload. It’s been so good to see you be active on insta 😭 super excited for the next vid
I think because chuck e cheese do half and half, they cook 2 fresh pizzas and put half and half together one just cheese/tomato and one pepperoni. Then maybe they put the left over fresh pizza sections together, so it's not recycled or eaten by others - just left over from half and half?
The pizza cutters at Chucky cheese are the reason for the messed up pizza. they're super dull for safety reasons. Food Theory did an episode on it because of You.
The notification made my day!
Leave the internet
🤣
It kinda.. makes sence have you ever tried them giant two handed pizza cutters? maybe you can try it yes test the pizza cutter that would be the final test! or just ask them not to cut the pizza up and bring your own pizza cutters?
Not yall in the comments saying we forgive this man/ want him back LMFAOOO gtfoh y’all are sad
😂 the merch part "You probably burned one, at one point" I actually got your mystery tee shirt merch last year and it's the conspiracy shirt and I love it. My brother noticed me wearing it and saw the Shane Dawson part and goes "I know how to get that part of the shirt to come off if you want because it's a cool shirt if his name wasn't on it"😲and I was like "No...I mean...No. Well I guess if he doesn't come back to YouTube it wouldn't make sense to have his name on it but I think I'm good for now"😂 I was kidding of course, I wasn't actually going to let him deface my shirt
I was with a smile on my face the entire video, thanks queen! Missed u! Love u 🐷🐽👑
Omg I laughed my tits off, loved this 🍕
WOAH the automated voice on the chuck.e.cheese number Ryland called sounded like Danielle from 90 Day Fiance! I had to go back twice and listen to that bit haha
Shane, you're so P! 😉
OMFG im so friggen happy you decided to create a podcast. Your magnetic energy is what everyone needs in their life. I'm happy you are seeming happier and healthier this year. I look forward to seeing all your blessings and success ❤

Shane you're less of a bear and more of a cub. Yknow what I mean? Lmao love ya
I use to secretly binge watch your videos while I was working, it made the day go so much faster. I couldn’t really find anything that compared the past year. So excited for the future videos!
I cannot get over Ryland calling your snorts honks 😂🤣 I’ve missed this in my life.

Hi Shane!!!  🤍🤍
Hell yeah bruh! Welcome back.

I just love watching your videos 🤩 you always got me laughing and it always puts me in a better mood! Your energy is so contagious! 🥰 I’m so glad your back and I can’t wait for more videos! 🤍
YAASSSSS the king is back !
Ok this was hilarious “why are they the only one who’s pizzas messed up?”  “Because…. They’re special.:)”
33:20 lol "the bad friend" XD make a movie out of that shane and chuckies big kinda mean adventure XD
🤍🤍🤍
Ryland's outfit..🤣 is the funniest thing I've seen so far this year!! Lol
Chuck E Cheese is P ofc... gottchu shane 👍
Lol Shane- “I wanna order a Chuck E Cheese Pizza to see if it’s still messed up”  Chuck E Cheese- “Shane Dawson, Ryland Adam’s & any known associates of them are on the BLACK LIST” lmfao 🤣
I love you ❤️
BOOO BOOOOOOOO GET OFF THE STAGE
Shane just don’t be a communist liberal and I’ll listen to your podcast lol
I liked how real it felt and unfiltered
Poor Emma 😭
your are so funny
I haven’t laughed at a Shane video like I did today in a long time miss u Shane
Why doesn't my video have sound?? Is it just my phone?
Omg i missed your videos so f&$)n much 🥰🥰cant wait for you to post weekly 😭😭
My mom met the founder of Chuck E. Cheese at our local 7-11
gotta team up with Kendal rae and mile higher podcast and lights outtttt yesss
Your videos make my day Shane!❤️🖤
WHOA!!! I'm a shookie f***** cookie
I love Shane Dawson. I’m so glad you are making a podcast and doing so much better. I’ve missed you so much. Past is past and I support you through it all. I love the climax you are taking. I love you 💛
Okay I’m only six minutes and twenty seconds in. However I need to say this before I forget. Shane I completely get where you are coming from with the wedding worries. You should look this up because you live in Colorado now, but it’s legal to marry yourselves in Colorado . Like just you and Ryland. You and Ryland can go into the mountains with a photographer. Have your beautiful I do moment together with no worries and however you’d want it and then you can invite everyone for a reception after to celebrate and get the wedding gifts. I also love the idea of a videographer to video some bits of you two getting ready. The walk up to each other. Some I do moments and the happy walk back. You can play that video for everyone in the reception and print out the pictures. to have for your guests so they still get a feel of being there. Keep that in mind because you should be at complete ease when marrying your soul mate ♥️ okay back to the show hah
❤❤❤❤
We have missed you!
Iam so happy  you are coming back love u Shane 💗
Thank you for the much-needed giggles, and welcome back.
Omg I laughed so hard! I’ve missed you so ffffff much!!!!!!!!! 😂😂😂❤️
I mean. I have YouTube premium and I always listen to Shane's new/old videos and in the car and lock the screen and don't actually watch the videos. So I would for sure listen to a podcast. :) don't go to Spotify tho :( do YouTube somehow or Pandora!!!
Imagine all the thoughts and connections youve made throughout your life, you really think all those thoughts in your head belong to you? You are merely a receiver, its what your body does with those thoughts that matter. I have murderous thoughts all day, because of the media, and my pre-exposure to darkness while i was innocent, too. Our brain is no longer bilateral, it is combining itself, thats why we think its us
Simulation..I met someone in a mental health hospital like that
I love any video you make!  I'm partial the hearing about your ghosts that follow you
Say what you want about Shane but his personality is entertaining as fuck
I’m adhd as fuck and Shane’s chaotic ass videos an exact representation of my a day in my brain
"Colorado changed me...made me Republican! Nah I'm kidding."  💀💀💀
Pizza theory: maybe they are large quarters slices that they slice in half and make a large pizza.
Stop. We missed you.
Ryland is getting thinner and thinner...
it’s the lawsuit for me 😭🤣
I love how you say my snort is back but bish it never went away and I'm here for it,   quuueeennn
Keep doing you!!!! We grow and we learn 🙏 😀❤
I think you guys should Airbnb your house or rent it out just in case you guys want to go back for a little vacation or a getaway or for business 🤷‍♀️
Honestly, the brain simulation conspiracy was kind of stupid. Please scrap that out.
NEARLY SHIT MY PANTS WHEN I SAW YOU POSTED. i love you 🥺❤️
I love how I'm on minute 12 and he already mentioned like 10 problematic topics
Shane, glad to see you’re doing well. You’ve changed for the better. Keep it up!
I swear to god am I the only one in this comment section that thinks that he should not be forgiven especially in this large of amount this is honestly disappointing. Just because everyone is done canceling him doesn't mean he should be forgiven.
Been watching for soooo longgg. Love seeing you so happy 💖
I’m in high school and I’m literally called Winnie the Pooh and teddy bear 😂😅
yayyy!!! Love you Shane 🖤
Low key, I want to order a pepperoni pizza from Chuck E. Cheese’s because it looks bomb😋🍕
comedic relief ftw 👏🏻
Ryland would be an otter and Shane would be bear
this video has been my favorite video you have ever made, you can tell how truly happy you are.
"I did it for like 7 years... I mean ✨it ruined my life✨" 😂😂😂 I literally spit my tea out
pushing 🅿️
Love you Shane <3. I love this new video and I missed you sooooooo much. I ordered the mystery bag and it's almost here, please do more merch <3. I just love to see you happy and making jokes and I love Ryland and Chris so much. Can't wait for next videos!
ChuckECheese is going to put a hit on Shane i swear
I think you have grown up a lot since when you got canceled. I was seriously mad at you for awhile. But I realized that you are only human and everyone says things that are dumb when they are young. I am glad you are trying to change and try new things. I hope it goes well for you. I really do. I truly did miss seeing your vids. Youtube hasn't been the same.....😄
This was actually so entertaining...
💙💜💙💜
I love how you can make fun of all the drama from the past lol. this was great.
SO good! Loved this surprise video, and even better that it included your old friend Chuck E. LOL! So great to see you back Shane, here's to many more videos!!! <3
Shane !!!! I was in a really bad place mentally this made my week!! I love you and this is EXACTLY WHAT I DIDNT KNOW I WANTED 🖤🖤✨✨
I love when your brother comes into the convo
This video has me DEAD😂😭 love you Shane!!!
gosh i love shane so much. even if im going through it i always put on any video and automatically i smile and just feel better. thank you so much shane fr
the “🅿️” emoji is from a song 😭😭 soo happy you’re back 💗💗💗
I missed you, dude. When the angry SJWs inevitably make a video saying you should stay cancelled and blah blah, I'm going to make a commentary on their videos, pointing out how stupid all their arguments are. You told some edgy jokes, apologized, and the stupid cancel bots took your apology as a shark takes the scent of blood in the water. I am determined to destroy cancel culture unless actual severe crimes are proven in a court of law. I don't care how offensive someone's speech is, they don't deserve to have their life ruined. And when I saw that you uploaded, I was like fuck yeah, Shane isn't cucking out to these keyboard warriors who would never say anything rude to someone's face. I knew you wouldn't. I even sent you a business e-mail telling you not to let them win, and I hope you got it. But welcome back, dude, I had forgiven you as soon as you apologized for what basically amounted to edgy jokes which were commonplace back then. You're a very likeable person, and you question the mainstream narrative instead of being a mouthpiece for it. Plus, I really like your dark sense of humour. As for the beauty community drama, I never got invested in that, as I don't really care. But even if you committed character assassination, you clearly knew it was wrong, apologized, and haven't done it again. Anyone who's still mad at you needs to grow the fuck up.
$80 for three pizzas? Get out of CA. Omg
I remember watching this dude 5 years ago with his scary ass conspiracy theories
This was the perfect video I needed today thank you Shane :)
Glaaaaaaaad you’re baaaaaaaaaaaackkkkkk ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️

Omg this makes me so happy
I love seeing you so happy 😀 you deserve it… I missed this 🐷
It is the pizza cutter. I’ve cut some messed up pizzas in my day. You try it Shane?? Make pizza and grab a pizza cutter and watch as the cheese melts into cracks and deforms it my guy
Seeing Shane’s brother was such a throwback! Haven’t seen much of him since his older videos
I will watch anything you post. I love all your videos. Watching you on Ryland's vlogs too makes me so happy that you have come such a long way and are genuinely happy. This world is cruel and we all have said and done shit, if anyone says no, they're liars. No one is perfect and that is the beauty of life. We learn and grow. Enjoy your journey Haha
$80 for 2 pizzas……… 🤯
Man thank you Shane 4 another video!

I don’t know if it’s my pregnancy hormones,but i’m literally so happy that you’re back Shane 🥺💓
Is anyone else like concerned that Shane is making this video when he was literally sued for it … so glad the videos are back though !!!
Thank you for coming back to your fans
SHANE  🥺
Damn! I dont know what different but Shane is looking rly goood 🧐 Maybe it's the fresh air or the fact that hes finally happy. Anyways LOVE to see it!!!
25:38 hahahah omg shane i love you
OMG Chuck E get it TOGETHER already!!!! Please give an explanation for this, it makes no sense. We WANT you to debunk it, Chuck E Cheese was the best overpriced part of our childhood. :/
You couldn’t have uploaded at a more perfect time ❤️ I really needed this! Missed you Shane 🥲
After the last couple weeks I’ve had, this is all I need to have some happiness in my life!!
Loved this!!! Post all the time!! I miss this (:

Shane needs to have Matt King on his podcast to discuss Chuck E Cheese. Matt worked there!!!
Omg
❤❤❤❤❤
You would look at a nightclub, like a ginger Scottish man who had never been out of glasgow
Disclaimer this is parody there was nothing wrong with Chuck-E-Cheese Pizza. This is comedy skit and the conspiracy about the pizzas 100% false. We just having fun. love you Chuck-E
It's already been disproven
needed this joy today.
I havent laughed this hard in a long time lmao I love you guys
i fucking love this video shane oh my god
Podcast!! Yaas!!😍
P is for preditor... and the pizza is probly cut and then cooked... that would explain the size difference....
this video made me so happy. more plsss🖤
Make more like this.. your energy was awesome!!!
80$ for 3 pizza is a crime right there. Like wtf.
The feeling I get when I go see a new Jordan Peele movie is the same feeling I get when Shane uploads & idc. ICONIC
Didn't you used to do a podcast with Lauren?
I miss this so much!!!!
Shane's lawyer be like: Aw shit, here we go again
Welcome back Shane~ ❤️

I LOVE EVERYTHING YOU UPLOAD IVE WAITED SO LONG OMG 💙💙💙💙

Regarding the topic of the conspiracy video…. My player must have abandoned the game. Because I’m super lazy, I never do anything and my life is a disaster.
Oh cmon, not his flat earth brother talking about a simulation.. I can't take this seriously...
♥️♥️♥️

I don’t rly like the way he treats ryland idk like maybe he thinks it’s just teasing and joking but it seems to actually hurt his feelings
The banter. The smiles. ❤❤❤❤❤ Thank you for giving this back to us!
After 3 hours of logistics equations, I seriously need this video 🥰  Lol you all look like toddlers dressed you 🤣🤣🤣
I’m currently only at minute 9, but I haven’t stopped laughing! 😂 Love you, Shane, and so happy you’re posting!
This video made me so happy! <3
I love all the pussy talk. 😂💯 glad youre so happy making a random funny video love you shane
That 2003 PowerPoint font is everythingggg
The way Ryland is looking at Shane....... ME WHEN.
Again I'll reference that video where Shane was sat in his closet YEARS AGO saying that one line consisting of how he 'hoped his videos took us away from all our shit for 5 minutes' and that was his goal.
Matpat did a  video about  chuck e cheese as well lol
The podcast should be named "Shane's Lawsuit"
You need to call and order the pizza UNCUT, just listen to their minds explode on the phone lil
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I’m 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don’t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.  I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn’t lose to anyone.
I feel like someone needs to work at chucks cheese n then tell us the truth..
omgggggg so nice that ur back we've missed youuu :)
Not what we want? you got that right Bucko. 43 minutes of you laughing, with zero content, with zero creativity. What a waste. I know you have 20 million subs but there's no accounting for taste right? We're all subscribed to watch you implode, and so far it's been right on track.
I GET IT.... 😂 We made it! Let’s go 2030 😂
I needed this today a few minutes that I laughed a bit and forgot that I will be kicked out of school for non payment
dude im SO glad. i really needed this today. like for real. thank you.
Idk about anyone else but this is EXACTLY what I wanted ❤️❤️❤️ love u Shane!!!!
Bitch I’ve been laughin nonstop 😂💜
This is so dumb.. You entertain literally every stupid thing that is presented to you. Time to grow up! 🙄
Funny Funny Shane 🤣🤪
i laughed so much, loved it
I would love for you to start a podcast !!
Now I’m happy ☺️👏🏻
I worked at Chuck E Cheese for a while, their pizza is always fresh but they just suck at cutting it 😩🤣
"To all subjects of Ymir"
ryland should do a mukbang with chuck e. cheese pizza 😭
Love it
Wait… no? He has a video up????? AAAAAAGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH   Is this a dream?
This might be my favorite shane video ever
Shane we’re happy you’re back! You’re helping people more than you know.
I lost Shane 🤣
I love how I was looking 40 min. of Shane talking about complete nonsense. Would do it every week 🤣!  We need more Shane. Try to not get sued next time lmao ! 🤣🤣
I AM SO HAPPY TO SEE HIM !! HE JUST MAKES ME SMILE SO MUCH ☺ I LOVE HIM SO MUCH . I LOVE YOU SHANE HAHA
The fact that people still supper you, is so fucking sickening.
I missed these videos for soo long! Welcome back!
The way ppl treated you, you’d think you would go conservative… libs are nutty lying communists and kids don’t know politics and just follow
Fun video! A podcast again sounds great!💗  Today I learned:  Shane 🐷 = Chuck E. Cheese Pizza 🍕
This is exactly what I wanted hope you make more of these
I think this type of content is what the world needs right now. Just a bunch of people having a good time and being hilarious while doing it. I think the pressure of these serious documentary style videos takes the joy out of being able to just make a fun video. Love this.
LOVED THIS VIDEO DEFINITELY KEEP MAKING MORE RANDOM ONES LIKE THIS BRINGING IN OLDER 3+ YEAR OLD CONCEPTS
died laughing when y’all said oh oh oh o’reilly ! Cause I’m LITERALLY sitting at one waiting and watching this video 😂 love you guys 😁😘
I haven't laughed like this for months thank u shane loved it 💓 💖 💗🤣😂
I missed your beautiful face!!! Love you Shane!!
HAPPY UR BACK SHANE. IM SO EXCITED FOR UR NEXT VID
regardless of what happened to shane or whatever hes made me smile on days i didnt want to smile 😭im glad hes back making videos 💕💕looks happy and healthy love that for him also a new TRUCK like what... Pop off shane 🤍
Shane’s brother looks like if PayMoneyWubby shaved his head haha not meant as an insult, just realized they look similar.
Love watching your videos ❤️
Maybe they make the pizzas like that purposely for publicity. Kinda like the conspiracy with starbucks where they write all the names wrong for publicity. They're still open so they must be doing something right, even if that is staying open from the money generated by people buying their pizza just to debunk the conspiracy
Btw I’ve never had a voice in my head before
Daily uploads would make my life! Ryland is a little annoying and he needs to let Shane live. Loved this video.
I'm so happy that you are happy and doing well! So excited for you! Both! Had to pause and write this, can't stop smiling💖 missed you a lot, thanks Ryland for the vlogs as well 🌻
Plz upload the conspiracy vid ASAP, I need more Shane in my life 💘
Omg!!! I saw your insta and thought this was coming tomorrow!!! I’m so excited to see your video!!!! Aahhhh I’m so excited!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
could not be any happier to watch a Shane video i didn't want.
19:30 lol imagining you and chuckie dancing together was epic ! YEAH your back!
THIS MAKES ME SOOOOOO HAPPY!!!!
❤❤❤
The GD spam in these comments is driving me nuts!  Hi, Shane. Glad to see you back. ❤️
i love you 🖤🖤
Am I in a fever dream? No, no, just watching a Shane Dawson video and I'm totally effing HERE FOR IT. Bout time long lost friend. Was gonna say matching sock but thats probably taking it too far. 😏🤭 lmfao lots of love ✌🥰😘
Just thinking about Chuck E Cheese, brings back the memory of their pizza smell. And that smell came from, the early 2000s. I haven’t been there since, elementary school.
I don't care what your videos are about I just want to see you! I live for your videos Ryland's videos and Morgan's videos
Love seeing you so happy 💓😁
All of y’all supporting him are not it…
SO happy to see you happy! I’m so glad you’re back! :,)
So glad you're back, Shane! ❤❤❤ been watching for 11+ years. 🥺🥰
So funny. I felt nothing happened in this video but I love the ride. Ryland's outfit to go to Chuck E. Cheese's tho🤣🤣🤣
Shane....... YOU MADE MY WORLD JOYFUL AGAIN  You look great and so do Ryland and Chris   it's a great day to be alive! XO
SHANE IVEEE MISSSEDDD YOUUUUU
CHRIS CRUMBL
You’re literally the most entertaining creator idec
THIS WAS AWESOME 👏🏼 I LOVED IT!
If you are going to claim Colorado, at least know we mostly vote Democrat now!
I love Shane and ryland! lol
SHANE 38:53😭😭
This is literally all we want 🥰
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Shane, I have to say I admire your resilience and courage to stay true to yourself regardless of how many times and how many people try to throw hate your way and I can see how with time you've actually found the people who truly support, love and care for you. Thank you for being you and don't let anyone ever tell you anything otherwise
Get it shane you go
My coworkers and I are DYING laughing over here! Soooo good! I love this so much
glad your back and doing well! cant wait for the new conspiracy video
YALL Shane liked my comment….. and then I edited it……and now it’s gone.   BRB while I go cry
Dawson returns! Somehow I feel this is Ye-inspired...
UGHHH I NEED THISSSS YESS SHANE IM SO HAPPY <<333 miss you!!
I had my first psychic reading last year and it was CRAZY.
So to sum it up, shane is dreaming about vaginas, he also loves Chris 😂 ryland would have a good vagina, shane saw a psychic medium and was going through some shit, shane does not like Chuck E. Cheese pizza it hasn’t changed and is thrown together ryland supports Chuck E. Cheese either way and says the pizza is good and it’s a good experience for your children, sad bish misses his food videos the end
Never clicked on a video so fast
Chuck-E, stop, we're friends.
You make me so happy king
Loved it!
I was just thinking about you the other day and hoping you'd have a video!  Each time I think of you, you come out with something! :)  Psychic... ;)
Chris filming yaaaassss
Yes wake up the people!!!!
holy shit the ryland dream intro lmao
I know i am not from the US and I probably don’t have a say nor does anyone want my opinion but i think the quality of chuck e cheese’s pizza is poor. There are standards businesses (especially food businesses) have to meet for their customers. Even if the pizza is cheap and is just “kids food”. Every single pizza, even the ones made myself, has never been in a state where there are gaps between slices and edges of the pizzas being further out than others. These types of things is just not what happens when a fresh pizza is made to order. You’ll probably have a better quality pizza from a frozen pizza in a supermarket. Honestly, it is truly appalling. Someone really needs to stand up against this company. Chuck e cheese is a huge chain of restaurants and probably will pay their way through lawsuits and claims. It is very unfair on the customer. It is ridiculous how a food company makes excuses for things like this. That pizza was not made to order, it wasn’t freshly made. Whether the pizza has moved in its box in transit or moved from when it was took out of the oven, no. Things like this does not happen. A freshly cut pizzas slices should slot together perfectly, all be the same length slices and not move away from each other during transit. I 100% believe they are using recycled pizza and putting fresh cheese and toppings to make it look fresh. This is how bacterial infections and food intoxications spread and can make customers very ill. It is poor hygiene and does not meet the correct health and safety regulations for the consumer. I am sorry to the Americans that have to put up with it. Don’t mean to offend anyone, just solely my opinion :)
FUCKING JARED OH MY SKY DADDY 😂 I missed you Shane ♡
Love it! You know Chuck e cheese sells frozen pizza at Walmart. Lol, but seriously.
Yes
they need to bring back the dislike button
This made both me and my sleep paralysis demon smile so much!
Oh God I missed this.
Love you guys! Watching fron Ontario Canada!🤍
PODCAST YAY!!!
I bet if you turned the pizza upside down you could tell better
Great video! Just the perfect thing to watch and celebrate coming out of covid isolation! (And Shane’s return of course!)
Change the title to how to make Ryland catch a charge and our house on the LA murder tours . 🤣
Finally :)!
but like this is exactly what i wanted
I’m so happy that you posted! I miss u Shane! ❤️ I hope u had an amazing Valentine’s Day yesterday! 💖
why are you back 💀💀💀
Chuckie cheese now sells their pizza at grocery stores. You should buy that!
HI I LOVR YOUR VIDEO A LOT HAVE A GOOD DAY

Where are the negative comments, I'm confused
I love you so much Shane😍😍😍😍😍
????? Huh

I missed you Shane!!!! 💕💕💕☺️
I agree with _sad_bish_69, miss you old food videos. Those, along with your Conspiracy Theory videos were my favorites.
Please do a video on the current very controversial "conspiracy theories" about Bill gates and klaus Schwabb. 👀👀👀👀😬😬😬😰
The fact I’ve been binge watching old Shane vids and he uploads 🥺🥺🥺♥️
I'd wear it too ryland.
This video just brought back all the feels of your past recordings. Can't wait to see more. We all have a past and it's great to see you have grown from yours
3:55 Stand up  Comedy 🤣🤣🤣  12:23 *plugs my kids ears as I am crying* what is this convo 🤣🤣🤣
I love that Shane is back. The video was awesome and all over the place
It would be nice to continue the documentary style videos too
AHHHH THIS CAME OUT RIGHT ON TIME TO CURE ME
Please don’t sell the house 🥺🥺🥺
I love the hanging out vibes. I like it when it's just Shane. YOU are the thing I want to see. I miss this 😢 thanks for making videos and keep going. Fuck the haters
I’m 12 minutes into this and I’m laughing so hard.
Super Hero And  Noble  Editor       Love you Shane
Happy to see you back, I hope you make more conspiracy theories cuz I haven't seen those in a long time but ik you probably won't make sum In a while and I understand that, I'm just happy you're back 👍🏼
🅿
Dear God Shane.
I was so excited when I saw this! I love Shane so much and so glad he is happy and thriving ❤
$80 on 3 fucking pizzas? WOOOW!
as someone who works at a pizza place and yeah sometimes we can cut it weirdly and the shape looks deformed but the severity of it they have AND that it’s so consistent has me worried asf
Yes! Such a good birthday present.. I’m 21 today🥳🤍😘
I am so happy 🥳🥰🔥 welcome home Shane
I just got called into work and I’m finding reasons to go home to watch this asap. I love you Shane - Jose from Texas
We missed you!
That pizza look good honestly hahahaha
Welcome back old Friend
at 18:57 i really got it, still am that way
HII
Im on my 30 minute lunch but since it's 43 minutes I'll definitely watch it when im off work lol. Thx shane for uploading can't wait to see ur video.
Happy to see you Shane! Happy to see you happy on here! I hope you’re happy in life
how is his vids free?
🅿️
@Shane !! If u want to donate one of your pig bags when cleaning out your make up room I'd be happily willing to take it off ur hands FR tho I was accidentally set on fire and can't work while I'm having surgeries and physical therapy but REALLY LOVE your pig merch and can't afford it so...just an idea😂😍🐷🐷
I really missed your twisted, abstract and messed up humor <3
great video Shane! ❤️
Ohhh I've missed you guys so freaking much, can't believe I cried and laughed so much... or that I have memories of your house or that you are actually back. Please never get canceled again
Seeing a notification for your video made me so happy
My mum and I love you. My mum nearly cried at the idea you might not come back. We both struggle a lot and you’re one of the things that connects us in our sadness to cheer up
It’s so good that Shane’s back😍😍 the adventure was hilarious imao
LOVR LOVE LOVE
I've never had Chuck E Cheese pizza before. Now im craving pizza. It's great to see you smiling and laughing again Shane. :)
Chris you’re my new fave 💜
I loved that video, laughed so hard. i love your humour Shane, :)))
Ohh and I Wanne know. How did you liked the new scream. I watch it I loved it
shane baby no 🥺 a ford??
I must admit that I miss Shane’s old food vids too. And right now… I could use some light hearted comedy.
Wonder if the secret is they come fully cut but frozen so that’s why the pizzas look off lol. Freezing then heating can cause issues with other stuff so why not their pizza 😂
Lmao I loved this video it was so hilarious and fun to watch!
Shane, I am oh-so-proud of you for continuing to be creative and working hard even though you went through such a difficult time. We missed you SO much and we’re so happy you’re back!! 🥺
Yes I’d buy a “tight pu$$y energy” merch like a tank top giving 00’s vibes
shane you look so good and skinny!
I was depressed lately and seeing your video got me right out of it
I think a Podcast would be awesome. People seem to naturally want to open up to you during interviews.
OMG  I'VE MISSED YOU SOOOOOOO MUCH😘😍. I know I see u on Ryan's videos but it's NOT THE SAME😄. This was just an old school long vlog and I LOVED EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF IT😝. I see ur jokes haven't changed much either😜. Is this ur coming back video?
WUT WOH
Shane , your past is on display for the world .. all of your mistakes and it’s just not fair for the world to judge so harshly .  If my past was on YouTube shiiiiiit lol and I’m sure most of these people (haters) wouldn’t have any room to talk.  Fact of the matter is , is that you’ve learned and grown into a better person and I’m proud of you , don’t be so hard on yourself ❤️
We love you brother glad your creating again
That was a fun surprise. Keep it going! 😊
In colorado, you can order Chuck E. Cheese pizza on DoorDash! I’ve never tried it but it’s an option 😂
Ok but I’ve never clicked on a video so fast in my life, I’m so ready for u to be back!
Just shit my pants best 40 odd minutes of my year been waiting on you to post forever, all the love xxx
I’m so glad your back Shane xx can’t wait for the podcasts if that does happen xxx we love youu

Love the chaotic energy! Welcome back!
I’m not even 5 min in and I had to stop to tell you how happy I am that you’re posting again, Shane!!!
Shane it’s so funny
🥺♥️ I’ve been having a super hard time lately.. these videos help more than you know. Thank you for what you do ♥️ Love you so much!
Missed you 😭
So happy that you seem to be so much happier and healthier Shane, your glowing and it’s so wonderful that you’re not afraid anymore to show your beautiful personality and soul!
Don’t get me wrong something about chuckie  cheese pizza hits different than ordinary pizza HOWEVER it gives me this special kind of heartburn that is indescribable and NOT worth the pain and agony  😓😂
Listen y’all the Kardashians are controversial, JoJo siwa is controversial, shit Lizzo is probably controversial but we all support them for some reason. I can’t decline a Shane documentary just cause he’s been controversial too.
I LOVED IT!!!! Glad we don't have Chuck E Cheese in Belgium haha
All these “jokes” towards ryland just made me feel bad for him lol
i'm so excited for the podcast! Welcome back <3
PODCAST YES SHANE!! I feel like that format is PERFECT for you and your stream of consciousness!!
Shane check out Jaime Maussan he is an alien 👽 expert and usted to have a show in México showing evidence of contact with aliens, he is amazing. I think you would like him and would be an interesting guest for your new podcast
'if youre watching this video, you get it' omg shane.. yep lmao
♥️ ♥️ ♥️
Bruh imagine eveeytime the player leaves and as we sleep is the amount the player left us in rest mode to fo their own life and then come back to play again which means waking up so if people wake up way too early and dont sleep much it means that the player is into the game and if your off to sleep it means the player has not much connection intot he game to be hyped enough to play it longer wich means your the least likable its a thought nothing mich but wierd
I believe where in a simulation 100%
I haven’t laughed so hard at one of your videos in too long!!! ❤️❤️ this was so good!!
This was hilarious great to see a video up again 🤣.
This video had me laughing so much 😂 can't wait to see more ❤
Yes ! We need a podcast! Fully support anything U put out ! Loved the video 🙌🙌🙌🙌glad to see u so happy and loving life ❤️
Ain't gonna lie I missed this bitch
Glad ur coming back
Omg he’s back!!! Never leave again
Can’t wait to hear it/see the podcast
Chuckie cheese sells pizza BY THE SLICE . They have pizzas on the heating table that are missing a few slices.  They put them together to make a whole pizza.  They're not pulling anything out of the trash they're just doing CREATIVE EDITING with pizza  !!!!
Next series is just gonna be Shane getting sued by Chucky cheese
YAYAYAY!!!! SHAY-BAE
Shane I love you and your personality is awesome can you please do conspiracy theories again please I miss those videos a lot
This was everything! I can't believe you went back to CEC 😂😂😂 Loved every minute! 🥳😍
Shane might be the only democrat I support
Shane would be like (hair flip): Hi sis (lawyer), I need you to review this video for me ASAP. 🤣 Is it just me or does everyone else also want a Shane and Chuck E Cheese update like regularly.
Senor pooh😂😂😂
SHANEEEE
Lol the throat joke😭😭😭😭😂
I AM QUAKING 😭
You should do a collab with MILE HIGHER PODCAST😍😍!!!! THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!!!
I’m just glad u still making videos
I just finished and Shane...your glowing and literally radiating positivity...and i really hope you do make a podcast i would be so freaking pumped if you really decided to do that🥰 congrats on your happiness love🖤🖤🖤
I love this so much! I'm so glad to see you happy and just living your best life once more.  I hope to see more videos like this in the future!
No guest list makes for no trials and errors. 🤣🤣🤣
Shane. You look AMAZING! Like oh my gosh. The transformation. I love you at any weight, but as someone who is also trying to lose weight, I know it's sometimes hard to see yourself. You look great! So proud of u!

It’s the long wait for videos for me 🤣 just kidding but really needed a dose of Shane and Ryland in my life. Thanks for the laughs! I love your content,  no matter what you do it’s your personality and sense of humor :) keep on smiling Shane
Yass! 🙌 Had to comment before even watching this, because.. We have missed you, Shane! ❤️ Now I can watch it in peace 😌
I'm having a fuckin fit ... Fucking cancel IT 😭😭🤣🤣

I'm so happy that you're back! I've missed you x  Definitely can't be the pizza cutter 😒   Yes, give the pizza a covid test 😋
"Due to local laws, Shane Dawson is not allowed in our facility." 🤣🤣🤣
More videos of you and Jared! such an interesting guy, that's for sure haha. Love it.
Can you do a Covid-19 conspiracy or is that way too political lol
I am so happy today…… a Shane video!!!!  ❤️❤️❤️

Shane we've been waiting for this one :))
Bring the podcast back!!  With Lauren!!
Purr 😻
We missed this ❤️
LOLLLLL!
Seriously laughed the ENTIRE time I was watching this! You guys are everything ❤️
I feel like im the 1% of shane viewers who are straight
omg @shane you meant to say " Chris Crumbl" (Kris Kringle) you're welcome.
I’m so glad you’re back making content even if it’s just 43 straight minutes of you flirting with Chris and trying to not get sued by Chuck E. Cheese. Haha this video had me crying- Welcome back Shane!! 😭❤️❤️
Been waiting all day for this upload once I found out you were uploading!!!!!
This was epic
I'm so excited that your back to making videos! Love Y'all!
Bitch IM READY FOR THE CONSPIRACY VIDEOS !!!!!
“My peni- like the gay”  “What does the word 🅿️ mean?”  Quotes by rylain.
Thank you for making my day! 😊
Shane, Ryland (And now Chris) are the friends I don't have, and really need in my life. Really needed this today, haven't laughed so much in such a long time.💖
I missed you so much Shane!🥰❤
ELLEN IS ALREADY CANCELLED. IM GLAD YOURE BACK.
Still here❤ love you shane!
So happy you are back!! More conspiracy videos please!! 🙏
I knida grew up on your videos watching your videos always feels good (no emojis to quite explain what i feel)
How many have you had!? *Ryland looking like a toddler in the back* three
Ive never seen Ryland Jealous , and all the pu$$y talk killed me. Shane talking is what you do best! Get yourpodcast on boo
It’s the pizza inclusivity for me  🍕😂
I like the urgent care sign right behind Shane when trying the pizza
Never leave Shane!
QUEEEN! 👑
Shane who is you’re favorite marvel character mine is Wanda especially AoU wanda
What happened to Adam 😩
Love Shane, but some of these jokes are to Cis-like for my liking. Idk, kinda felt uncomfortable at times having a vagina referred to ONLY woman when I'm not one.
Missed you love YOU and everything about you since day 1 all the ups and downs ❤️ Greet your mom/queen from me ! Keep going this is what you were ment to do 🙋🏾‍♀️❤️🥺🙈🥰💕🎊
I want all of the bedazzled things in your beauty room!
Not the pushing 🅿️ definition 😭
Honestly i love the just grabbed the camera to do bunch of random things while trying not to get sued concept
I would love a podcast from you!
Omg you pulling up in the truck was definitely something I never thought I’d see 😂 Missed these videos, Shane!
i was so bored and honestly i got so happy when i saw the notif. just finished the vid :)
Good to see you again sir.
yess!!! you're back! missed your videos.
You should really do a new video, order a couple Pizza's from Chuck e cheese, and see if they will give you a pizza NOT CUT! THEN take them home and try cutting em with different cutters and see if you can get the same results as you get when you order one pre-cut.
I’d buy a shirt saying “before you know you don’t know” 😭😭
13:22  had me cackling 🤣🤣 yaaaaas 🤍
Shane’s below 20 million now? Why….
BITCH!!!! You are back my life is complete again! I will forever be a fan of your work and how much dedication you put into your work😭❤
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH 😭
Why haven't we seen you
Such a good video so funny❤️❤️❤️
I misses Shane so much!! He's back!!! Post more!!!
Emma joookes! 🤣🤣🤣
I haven't belly laughed like this in sooo long! Welcome back
This video had no substance but turns out that was all we needed also I want pizza now
This video had me reflecting on the tightness of my own vagina. I definitely have TPE and would love to share it with the world. . . By wearing your merch. 👀 Probably not as tight as Rylands but I digress.
This whole video is basically Shane flirting with Chris
Loved the video! Had me laughing so much. Thanks for making my day way better !!
Let's gooooo!!!!!! I'm so freaking happy to be watching this! You made my fucking WEEK with this upload!!!! Xoxox love u Shane!
I just 100% can't understand why the pizza is so fuc*ed up! Even I have had some insane pizza there in a different state! 🤣🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕
LOVE YOUR VIDEOS REALLY MISSED THEM!!!
🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️🅿️
80$ for 3 pizzas.....😳 Damn
Never been this early I LOVE YOU
Love it but when is the next video coming out 🤪🤪🤪
Omg I haven't seen Jarid in a LONG time
Ayeee
Please do more conspiracies with your brother!! <3
Is chuckecheese that bad omg hahaha
Extra funny in this video … 🤣
I worked at Chuck E Cheese all through high school and can say that pizza cutter is definitely intimidating. I've definitely messed up tons of pizzas in my cook days. Please never get into that rat costume it was required for all employees back in the day and that thing stunk so bad 🤢. So glad to see you back I've missed seeing y'all!!
What’s the drama with the consistency merch? I know I should know but I never did pay attention to the drama
16:30 okay this just made me straight up scream 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Love you beautiful starlight. Glad to see you laughing and smiling. Sending you joy and hugs 💜
I remember when Shane made dumb funny sh*t on his channel
Love your videos Shane! So relatable and funny. Always brings a smile to my face. And yes I already have alot of your merch, you need to come out with new stuff!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This was great Shane! Thanks for making my day!
Really missed your videos Shane!!!!
I’ve missed you so much. Welcome fucking back for real.
Omg yey!!! I missed you guys!!!
Not you pulling up in the truck while we all know (from the vlogs) that Ryland drives it more than you😭
Rlly hoping u don't get sued
Me encantan estos videos
This video killed me, so glad to see you back!!!!!
This was not on my bingo card! 😱😅
I would definitely listen to the podcast!!
Mismatched pizza aside - I don't know anyone anyone older than 10 can like that pizza.
me when i saw this notification :😳
I wanna watch this again and I’ve just watched it:/
I love you Shane ❤️❤️❤️. I missed you're videos. You are my happy place. I love watching you're videos. When my anxiety is going through the roof. You're videos are making me feel better . Don't ever stop being you.
Honestly shane eating less than ryland is a mood I strive for lol

Okay, but I was not expecting to see the revenge of Chuck E. Cheese 😂😂😂 🍕
shane saying "I'm like the a*usive friend.." 33:20  Right. "like"
Was not expecting this!
Hi Lovr Shane
Shane is the only youtuber that could get away with a 40 minutes long video. I could watch him for hours.
Why did he order 3 pizzas if his not going to eat it lol should of just got 1
Chuck E cheese is a big f**king scam, dude... It's so obvious it's not the same pizza
🅿️ means pimp and pimp means you get a lot of bitches lol
Oh my, this is so funny. I actually spit my drink out, laughing!  You're the best Shane!  Keep them coming!!!!
Yay!!
I fucking love anything and everything you do cause I love you,you are contagious and I got me some Shane fever ✌️❤️🇦🇺
Bday surprise 😱
He's back!! 🔥🖤🔥🖤🔥
Shane came back and now I remember where my entire personality came from 😏😈
Shane, despite what has happened, you truly have grown as a person and you are an amazing human being! Glad you're back.
FINALLY
There's the throat chakra Shane! It deals with communication!
Omg i missed shane so much and his humor and just everything ahhhh i cant ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Shane, you could upload your morning 💩 routine and I would watch it 😂❤️
First off glad to see your alive second I need more paranormal video’s & third  when is the wedding
Wait, I *love* Shane’s brother! When is the conspiracy video coming out?!
I needed this so much today ❤️❤️
I love u and im super happy to see u back we neeeded this, and you needed this!!♥️♥️im excited for what is going to come after✨✨
Had such a good time laughing❤️seriously love you guys!
SHANE WE LOVE YOUR CONSPIRACIES
This video is utter chaos & I am LIVING for it!!!
This made my week. Thank you Shane!!
Aww I stan a good Shane video. Love you in Ryland's vlogs and was hoping you'd upload something on your channel. Stay 🅿️. Wait did I use that right?! Damn I'm showing my age 😂😂😂
Lmfao the republicans part got me 😂
🅿️ means pushin p look it up Shane 😮‍💨
Welcome back Shane!
Okay, I have a conspiracy. What if Shane being cancelled was the salty beauty community ruining his sales of products? Like he did so well, they saw how well he did and saw it as a threat so the big brands were like nah, we need to get rid. And what better way in todays age of cancel culture to do it? Idk, just seems weird that straight after Shane made millions and exposed areas of the beauty world that suddenly he’s cancelled. Why didn’t this stuff that happened years ago effect him years ago? Idk, it’s just bookie to me especially with how Shane exposed the toxicity of beauty. Maybe they thought he’d continue to expose it in further series? Make more money? Hmmm
I love how the old Shane is back and no fucks are given anymore
Can't you just ask that they don't cut the pizza for you ?
I'm not goint to lie... that pizza looks good.
i genuinely really missed these chill videos from shane 🥺
OMG SHANE POSTED
Hi, Shane, I'm so glad to see you back! You look so genuinely happy! I do want to say one thing though about the pizzas. I never worked for Chuck E Cheese, but I did work as a manager for Pizza Hut for a year and that included having to make the pizzas as well as cut them so I've got a little bit of knowledge behind it. From what I was able to see of the pizzas (As the footage was usually quick and not really focused) they are actually made perfectly. I can see where when the person used the cutter that it might have pushed the pieces apart and the hot cheese slid in between and solidified making it so that the pieces would join back together and stay. The smaller pieces of pizza is just simply from how they cut the pizza. I've cut really thin slices before as its hard to cut the slices equally. In comparison to the pizzas from a few years ago which did look a bit sketchy, these ones are made perfectly! Hope that answers some of your questions!
Neat
Shannnne so happy to see you happy 😃
Soooooo glad you posted!!! 🥰🥰🥰
this was literally so funny thank you shane
Video was too short 😂😩
I love this!!
I havent watched this yet. But i dont care about the conspiracy videos at all. I would rather have a vlog. Or just you talking about anything.  But i will & always watch any video that you are in regardles.
i didn’t not know i was still subscribed. goodbye
the queen has returned to her thrown and I'm graveling
Speaking on O’Reily, did anyone else use to think it said “Al Al Al Alrightyy Auto Parts” 😂😂😂😂😅😅

I got the notification on my phone and immediately clicked 'stream to TV' 😂  Really fun video, I laughed a lot! Glad to have you back Shane!
Aw Shane you're back I missed you so much. Feels so good to be laughing with you again!!!!
I just smiled for 43:23 mins straight
Ya can’t cancel natural comedic timing. So funny.
LOVED THIS VIDEO! Couldn’t stop smiling
I hope, no matter our differences, that we can all agree Shane does the best documentaries… just facts
you have no idea how happy I am right now❤️❤️❤️❤️ love you
I love the real ness he brings to his videos. Shane you are beautiful and amazing whatever you do. I highly consider you to become a producer. You been on YouTube for over a decade. In my mind one of the best pioneers of YouTube  in this lifetime. I bow to thee King Shane!
I’m a manager at a pizza place and I’m going to say this right now I’ve fucked up cuts but the pizza is still perfectly round even being slid into the box I’m honestly not sure why there pizza is all fucked up all I’m saying this shit doesn’t add up the pizza Shane bought in the video looked fine to me but the other pictures around the internet make absolutely no sense
i missed you Q_Q
I love the urgent care in the background while eating the pizza😂
THIS WAS just straight up hilarious. Definitely made my day better.❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
It's about time bitch. Love you.
This was uploaded the day before me birthday. This video made my day! Love you Shane!
Can't believe the pizza was $80
God, I had missed your sense of humour, this was so funny
Pls pls pls do a podcast
Still not going to Chuck E. Cheese.
Welcome home Shane!
I loved your food, dumb diy, and your conspiracy videos
After all the allegations of what happened idc I still like your content and will watch you no matter what
I don’t know how to feel
“ Chuck E. wE’Re fRiEnDs!!” 🤣😂💀
I was way to excited when my phone notified me about this video. 💕
The only suit Shane will be wearing for his wedding is a LAWSUIT after this video!
Next video…Shane and Ryland make pizzas (and buy store ones) and cut them up all fucked up and see if they all fit together? Cause surly shouldn’t matter how it’s cut or even if it’s not mode a perfect circle, it should be like a jigsaw and should all fit back together? As I’m the edges fit?  Glad to see you making videos again 😊
Ahhhhhhhhh sooooooo amazing to watch you again xxxxxx. Lots of love coming your way from Bristol England xxxxxx
Idc what any of you say I actually like chuckee Cheese pizza 😭😭
In the beginning you didnt want to go back to LA and now thanks to that we have this great entertainment. Thank you LA.
I literally love your brother
Omg lololol
Of course the video you come back on is Chuck E Cheese related LOLLL
I have 5 dollars for the house. You have 24 hours to respond. No negotiations.
What a nice surprise!!! 😍✨💓 You are so talented Shane and I am so happy to have you back! Eager to see what films you will make in the future.  I love watching your videos in the morning with my coffee. Definitely cannot wait to watch this!!! I am so eager to have more hour long Shane videos.
Please tell me that pizza really didn't cost $80 😳
This was hysterical!!!
I thought I hallucinated when I saw shane post

Yo but actually this is the best and the most funniest video I’ve seen all week. I love all the jokes. Take care shane :)
12:30  It is very much so the opposite Ryland 😂

Podcast Shane used to keep me up for days yessss
OMGGG SHANE AND FRIENDS PART 2!!! I'm so excited that was my favorite podcast. Can Jess possibly be a guest?
ok Shane Stark at the end there 🙌
I've been so stress lately and seeing that he posted a video brightened my mood I've miss his videos alot life is not the same without him
Love it
I found this genuinely funny.
welcome back. i hope you learned your lesson man, you have been a source of entertaintment for me since i was like 13... now i'm 20.
i’m only ten minutes in and i’m in tears from laughing so hard 🤣
Love you Shane💞
I love that I got a dominos ad before you went to chuck E. Cheese 🤣
Pushin 🅿️… sorry I had to don’t come for me 💀
I genuinely appreciate this vid Shane I've been having a bad week and watching your videos makes me feel less alone than I am now.
Love the hate comments lol you click on here but you hate him lol ok
Love this🐷
So excited for this new podcast! Yesss Shane!
Shane stop the bullshit excuses.. and dodging the issue. Time to get married a bitch ain’t got a life time to wait……. Hugs nice to see you back!
I'll watch all those ads on your daily vids if it means more pizza slander 😏 and more Shane!
you just gave me the joy that i needed. Thank youuuuuu
6:37 I DIEEEED 🤣🤣🤣
ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS!!!! LOVED IT ❤️❤️❤️  YOU'RE AMAZING 😘  KEEP IT UP,  IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU HAPPY AGAIN!!! 😊 😊😊 CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE.
Oh don’t worry Shane we want it!!!! Lol
Great video! I’m so happy that your back I don’t think you understand how much you make me happy! I wish you a good year with your writing and I hope you don’t get sued😁❤️❤️
Please don’t stop making videos Shane 🥺🥺🥺 make them until your old and wrinkly
Missed you!
What if Chuck E Cheese pizza looks bad so they got more people going to their Resturant and buying things? That would be quite smart?
Soooo excited!!! I didn’t discover you until after the 🚫🙅‍♀️ 👀  No shade 😎 I was apparently living under a rock 😆😆😆 love your videos (and Rylands ) Y’all are so  adorable 🥰
this is exactly what i wantt dont get me wrong i love the conspiracy videos but i just miss having a good time (that sounds more depressing than it should be but.. accurate!)
boii plz. WHY ARE YALL BEING SO NICE TO HIM WHERES THE JUSTICE LMFAOOOO
the editing and humor in this video.. LMAO im in love haha. so excited for the podcast and conspiracy video!! this one was great!! missed you, ryland and chris!! :,)
why don't they recreate Chuck E Cheese's cooking and cutting style for the pizza and see if it turns out the same? I'm assuming since their pizza is hand made but their wait times are not long, that its very quickly made. Which probably means they don't roll the dough out into a perfect circle to begin with, and then once its cooked its cut very quickly, which could make for strange looking gaps and shapes?? I don't know...
Is 'p' = pogers (couldn't find the emoji)????
Yesss!! I will support your podcast!!
This is what I needed to make my day 100 times better
This video was “pushing 🅿️” 😊
But for real tho, that pizza is recycled. Let's not lie to ourselves.
I clicked SO FAST ♥️
Just finished watching. I hope you see how much we've missed you and can't wait for you to come back! I was dying when you said "that's what I think when I'm missing pussy"
The look on Shane’s face at the pizza just says it all / speaks volumes ✨😂😂👏👏
Welcome back ❤️❤️❤️
5min in and the video hasn’t started yet  Edit: 10min and the video hasn’t started  Edit: 15min in…  Edit: 20min…
I wish i could get your merch but 1 im broke and 2 my friend tried and there was an issue at canadian customs
I haven’t laughed like this at a video on YouTube in a long time! x
Omg, this right here I why I love u Shane. I have never been more excited to get that notification ❤❤
Smiled the whole way through, thank you Shane ❤️
throw it back in the oven at like 200 degrees I think thats sanitaryy?? just not appealing at all idk idk. Food Service-Food for thought
IM SORRY $80 FOR 3 PIZZAS ? WHERE THE FUCK , WHAT THE FUCK yes i screamed that ! thats bomkers, damn is there anything in america not fucked up lmao
Welcome back! I missed your documentaries!
I love Shane. I'm so glad hes back. I hate cancel culture. Bad jokes are not illegal. Frowned apon. But not illegal.
Chuck E. Cheese pizza is so good probably some of the best pizza I’ve had tbh
No one can ever make me feel less about you. I've been watching you since I was a young kid and now I'm 27🥺 I love you Shane.
Wait I love that your back cause your my inspiration to create. Also love that you have joined the marvel fandom. And heck yeah can’t wait for this podcast
I haven’t laughed so much since ryland’s vlog but omG I missed your comedy on your page. Literally won’t find anything as funny on YouTube til you upload again ❤️❤️
hahahaha pushin P
Yay Shane 😁😁 this made my day. Glad to see you back Shane ❤️
Loved it 😍 here’s an idea: make a pizza at home perfectly round and get a pizza cutter like theirs heavy and big and cut it up so we can see if it can really happen. 😂
Long over due my guy
I’m shook!
The fact that the urgent care is behind you while you're talking about chuck E cheese pizza has me rolling 🤣
The way I felt actual joy getting this notification 🥲
Cried laughing at this video 😭. “ OH RYLANDD “
glad your back shane
I was not expecting that notification. I have never clicked on a video so fast!
Stopped everything for this, was not disappointed! Love you Shane!
Sensing a upload coming I was just checking his channel yesterday and I seen it on Instagram and I'm 😮
Ok I laughed a lot welcome back Shane
Chris crumbles should be his name
Next Episode: Shane’s Polyamorous Life
i have crapped myself i am so in love with this video, there is dookie spewing out my bum yas bring the amazing videos i wont stop crapaping so happy
Definitely never eating Chuck E. Cheese pizza in my life again
I live in Colorado and I love the “Colorado changed me” comment 😂😂
Hi Shane! Wasn't expecting this during my birthday week! Miss you!
I haven't even watched the full video but that intro had me dying 🤣🤣🤣
❤️❤️
And he’s back!!! I’ve missed you so much, Shane. Much love ❤️
The pic from his tiktok ❤❤ love it!!
Honestly, this is exactly what i want. Welcome back.
I feel like if someone ordered singular slices of pizza they save the rest of the pieces and if someone orders a full pizza they just throw together whatever slices they had from other batches.
This is like Metallica making a sequel to the Black Album, and it being REALLY fucking good.
this video is just what I needed today! haven’t laughed so much in a long time! missed you on youtube Shane❤️
Yassss Shane! So glad you uploaded. Highlight of 2022 🥳
I like how Shane has a “straight” voice
He's for sure gonna get sued again 😂😂😂😂
amazing!!
I was shocked when i got the notification for shanes channel, i froze and was so shook that i had to tripple check 💙 welcome back Shane, shanegang is back🥰
Click bait to the max...but technically not a lie
Bi-poler
I never comment on videos but I really missed you shane. And i laughed so much!
I’ve had two birthday parties for my son at Chuck E. Cheese.. the most recent time, we got pizzas… and the crust / cut did not look like yours… that’s weird bro
Love you Shane! Big hugs from belguim 🇧🇪♥️♥️❤️
🌻
You gotta documentaries of haunted places please 😭😭😭
We miss you Shane
Shane, i get it. ❤️
Just stay this time! I don't wanna be without this for more then a few weeks at a time if anything ☺️
Maybe they do that “hack” where the cut some of it off to eat for themselves 🤣
It was great seeing shane back on YouTube can't wait for more,he has been missed
I’ve missed you. ❤️
Not even one minute in and I’m like 😳😳😳😳😳 that is crazy to think about
So glad you’re back Shane!! This made my evening🧡✨
Day = made. I’m so excited to see what’s to come!!!

I laughed so hard! Loved this! ❤😂
Gawd i missed ur videos
I missed you soooo much! Watching rylands vlogs made me happy but seeing you posting this video made my 2022!❤️❤️🥰
shane read this and only this KEEP FCKIN POSTING PLEASEEAEASJKFKJ,ASGNJLASNGKLASGKML
literally screamed when i got this notification and my sister had to ask if i was ok💀💀
Ch-yucky
Shane Dawson is prime evidence of how short YouTube's audiences' memory is
Just What i needed today💕
I worked there in high school. The pizza comes fresh out of the oven and you cut it with this huge huuuuuge big knives life straight from the oven. It gets cut and then the cheese it still all melty so it never fully lines back up perfectly if that makes sense.
Wait but what if Chuck E Cheese cuts the pizza before cooking it cause like, pizza dough shrinks so they wouldn’t fit together perfectly after being cooked 🤷🏼‍♀️
Loved this! 🤣🤣🤣
i was laughing the whole video i missed u
We’ve missed you!! <3
I’m so excited you made a new video I love it so much couldn’t stop laughing love you
"before you know, you don't know" needs to acc be merch id buy it lmfao
Really enjoyed this, I'd love to see the food videos back
Legit, I wonder if maybe they cut the pizza before they bake it? To me that would make sense as to how each slice could be slightly off from each other and make it look uneven. Just a theory.
I JUST REALIZED THE SIMULATION THEORY IS LITERALLY SWORD ART ONLINE
Just yesterday I thought about you posting or if you where really gone life's weird 😉
This is the most i've laughed on YT in a while, Thank you!
Shane's videos are literally just talking nonsense that make absolutely no sense for an hour but you can't help but smile all the way through.
💕 your videos always made me happy. thank you
ALWAYS here for a Shane video and Rylands vlogs 🥰
Do you think maybe they cut the pizza before baking it? That would make the slices bake differently mayby? 🤔 then again i do give a feck, chuck e cheese pizza is frikin bomb and i'd smash one all on my own 😂😂🙏🏾
This brought me so much joy 🥲
Chuck E. Cheese pizza tastes good but it looks so sketchy
:,))) excited 💚❤️
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Shane, I have to say I admire your resilience and courage to stay true to yourself regardless of how many times and how many people try to throw hate your way and I can see how with time you've actually found the people who truly support, love and care for you. Thank you for being you and don't let anyone ever tell you anything otherwise
Day = made   I feel so happy again!! We missed you Shane!
I actually feel bad for Ryland in this. You can tell he's uncomfortable with the way Shane is talking to Chris.
Absolutely for a new podcast, just this time try not to say anything you'll regret 🤣
Honestly was having a rough few days and this video just made me so much happier!
Shane sweetie you're not fat🤗🤗
Absolutely hilarious! Love it!
Please do a Disney vlog lol
also, i hope youve seen all the shane tiktoks where they have that one filter on omfg it is so funny

Laughter really is the best medicine. I'm so happy to see you in a better, happy place in life. The move to Colorado really did you good.. Keep on shining..
Damn I’ve missed these videos 🤍
I'd love a podcast from you!
It’s not a real Shane Dawson video if Shane isn’t on the verge of being sued due to the topic 🤣❤️
Loved this video 🅿️
I'm so happy!!
Always very funny 😆
I absolutely loved this! I was thinking if to do another makeup look and Shane’s video just popped up so yeah… chuck e is so gonna sue you again 😂😂😂😂

It's 2022! I get it Shane, and I'm glad we both made it :)
This gives me life xD
Would love a Shane and ryland at Disney vlog
When Ryland said “let’s get you in that suit!” I played that part back like three times 😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
Please no one ever take anything Shane’s brother says as a fact.
I love your videos
Now that you have a pickup truck you should go to a gun range and learn to shoot .... THEY HAVE PINK GUNS NOW !!!!!!
Chuck E. Cheese is not the P😂
The p thing means you are pushing p but idk what i means lol but ik what it is called
My family all screamed in unison when we saw this notification! Can't wait to watch tonight! Love ya Shane!
I WAS cleaning until I seen this notification pop up on my screen... Now, I am taking a slighhht DETOUR into a shane documentary <3
Yaaay for podcast!! 🤩
Glad to see you back Shane, can't wait for all the epic content <3
I am so thrilled that you did this video and I hope there are a lot more to come. I’ll do a podcast with you!🦕🦕🐪🐖
The pizza is cut with a cresent blade  called a meza luna. That's why the pizza looks uneven.
i wanna make a makeup palette with you and J star it’s true tea.
I had a really bad day today and as soon as shane came up in the truck i smiled. Thanks for brightening my day shane. Forever grateful.
Omg so happy to get that notification
Doesn’t look like he’s changed but who onows
Make a pizza at home and slice it to see if it does the same thing
I'm old, please young people explain to me what the 🅿️ means.
Shane I just need to be your bff❤️ I’m so glad you’re back! Can’t wait for more conspiracy videos!
Wasn't expecting this notification, but was happy to see it! Happy to see a new video Shane and can't wait to see more😊💖
Where are the negative comments… literally?
I was thrilled to see this notification!  So glad your back ❤️
i like how shane is casually yet obviously trying not to get sued lmfao
$80 for three pizzas?!
All the company had to do was say they intentionally rearrange the slices to make the pizza look ‘wacky’. But nope.
Weeeheyyyyyyyyy he's back
So…. I’m confused?
i will pay you with all the money i don’t have to do more conspiracy and ghost hunting shit, i’d binge it for hours years ago while doing my makeup before work
Yup yup
SO EXCITEDDDD
complaining about no being married yet. my fkn life bro's Been engaged since 2019 and still no date ugh so frustrating.
So happy you’re happy! Hope you’re back!!
Shane looks so good!! Glad he’s doing better mentally. I think the break was much needed although you were deeply missed!! Can’t wait for that new conspiracy video! 🤩
Podcast idea: You interview people that have gotten canceled and do a “Where they are now” 😗😗😗
Those pizza's sus af
Shane should stop before he comes too sad.
Welcome back queen!!!! I was so happy to get this notification!
This video is exactly what I needed in life! Welcome back Shane!!! ❤️
Well, hello there. I'm only 10 minutes in and this is basically a description of my current brain post-partum from twins and its fine. 😅
omg😭😭😭
Shane woke up and he said "fuck it im getting sued today" LMAO I love you
Shane. I hope you showed this to your lawyer before uploading 😂😂 loved it. Also we need a good ole fashioned “making a cake out of every kind of little Debbie desert” video. Just one 😂
LOL we need a chuck e  cheese collab!
I haven’t genuinely laughed at a video in a while! I’ve missed Shane. I’m assuming the pizza is jacked up because they also serve by slice so they’re putting together mix matched pies they’ve already cooked to make your whole pizza
the introduction itself has me so invested in this
I watched your conspiracy videos over and over again! You coming back and doing this has made me so happy!💜 exactly what I needed!💜
Rats like cheese dipshit lol and they sell pizza so that's why they have a rat
I'm so excited for content!! I adore you Shane!! Missed you so much
I haven’t laughed this much in ages🤣 great video shane!
Where are they now? 😂
Love you Shane!!!
I LOVE THIS I WANT MORE VIDEOS 💗💗💗
Shane looks so happy and healthy now ❤ I get so excited everytime he posts it just makes my day! Love you Shane
Amazing!!
So, how much of it did your lawyer make you take out? 😂 Loved this video btw. Do more random/stupid shit. The world needs more laughs ❤️
Shane we love any video you put out. We love seeing you on youtube besides Ryan videos. Don't be harsh on what you put out there. We still love you!! ❤❤
I missed u...
When u said that the women said "your next chapter involved movies..." i instantly though, 'maybe she was talkin about all those marvel movies u watched' lol
Missed your videos!

This really made my bad day so much better, I am so excited to see where this year goes and what you come up with Shane!! 🥰❤️
♥️♥️♥️. That you are back!
“Am I a fucking …bear…?” 😂😂
So you made fun of G.A.R.R.E.T.T  W.A.T.T.S for liking Marvel and Kill Bill and now you're obsessed with both of those things? Embarrassing
Omg thank you so much for making this video. I’m only half way through it but I gotta go to class. I can’t wait to come back and see wtf you bouta do with Chuck e cheese
Shane doesn’t need the world, the world needs Shane
Yes please daily uploads!
watching this gem before Chuck.E takes it down 😩
I love this so much-
I'm so glad to see you back! I've missed your content!
please keep making vibes and start a podcast
Hahahaha the ending 😂

Yall might not like Shane but he so perfect and amazing <33
I just got back home seeing the new Matrix movie. Thinking on the way back home how crazy it would be if the Matrix was real and then this intro🤣😭
So glad you’re back!  You seem so much happier, and i’m so excited about that 😊
And I OOP
If Shane is going straight...can I be first in line please? I've had a huge crush for way too long...im a few years older, but im super hot! My husband won't mind. 😁 He can join. He's super hot too. Hell..bring Ryland! The 4 of us..❤️
Yayyyy Shane!
Omg yas Queen ! ❤️
Why is Shane so gullible. I mean I like the views on this topic and I believe in other dimensions but his reactions are always so cringe.
Wow this is making me shookt. Will not watch for now since i wanna watch this on a bigger screen
That was not a different person. That was you. You may have changed but it was you, not a completely different person
imo, all the shock humour and shock value of his old jokes didnt make sense to me at first. But after a while, i realised there was nothing actually criminal. He didnt do anything. He didnt act on that. So glad you’re back Shane <3
I'm not a DOCTOR 🤣
Ew
PLEASE DO A PODCAST OMG
This is what I needed- just to come home and watch Shane as I eat oreo cake.
I’ve thought about the simulation theory and they way I think of it is like the sims , you can tell them to go take a shower but if they’re too tired or hungry they will just crack it and not do it , or they’ll randomly put the dishes on the sink and forget to wash them then you keep telling them to and it cancels the action - that’s what I think the ‘player’ is doing to us in this ‘simulation’ , when we have thoughts like, I should get up and exercise but we’re like ‘no I’m too tired’ hahah
Not gunna, I just turned 30 the other day and im surprised I made it this far… so I feel you Shane x
Ugh! He's been out of it for so long, yet when he comes back he is exactly the same as he was before. He still hasn't grown up, still looks dirty and isn't funny at all. He learnt nothing!!
love you shane 💜
Chamberlain Coffee is typing 💬
Why do I only have four senses? I was born without the sense of smell bruh. Does my simulation have a bug? Was my game rushed to release?
Haven't clicked so fast have missed your vids💜
This video was SO MUCH FUN!
I literally teared up Laughing!! Welcome back Shane!! Til the end! Love you both🌈💜🤗💝
wasn’t expecting this video today
you look amazing sweetie
The queen is back 🐷
anyway…..
Going to have a Crumble Cookie cake for your wedding?
i missed being able to watch new shane videos, it just makes me feel like its 2o16-2018 again! yes i know shane has done some very controversial things but i still feel like everyone can change for the better. and i think he has 🍄
PLEASE START A PODCAST
Okay I'm only literally 2 seconds into this video and the second I heard chains brother say we are in a simulation I screamed I'm so excited
I'm dying 🤣 about the chucky cheese part  hilarious 😂 we are laughing so hard over here...im so glad you're back 😁
Omg omg OMG 😃
Im shook! Omg! Love ya Shane! 💜
Seeing this pop up made my day so much better.  I am so glad to see you back even if it is one video in a while.  ❤️
Good to see you posting again. :) I prefer these kind of rambly update videos to your serious conspiracy theories.
LOVE YOU SHANE!!
My serotonin levels are back up
Waiting for that eventual video when they plan their wedding day and get married 🤣
Shane’s lawyer quitting after this video 😂😂😂

As someone who worked at dominos for 4 years, I can admit I’ve cut some pies that definitely look misfit like that LOL especially if you’re cutting it too fast.
I’m so happy your back!
YESSSSSSSSS❤❤❤❤❤❤
The fact that the pizza is still fucked up 💀😂
I hope this year brings you success and true happynes
SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS NOTIFICATION!!!!   Also already excited for the conspiracy video!
I was literally just watching ryland blogs with Shane yesterday n this happened
Yay!!! You're back.. And I'm here for it..
Absolutely love this video Shane I’ve missed you so much and ur honestly such a positive part of my life❤️❤️
I have my thoughts about the pizzas

Ive been really sick lately and seeing this notification made my week
You going to hell
2022... yes
“you used to HONK but now you’re taking off”  “The least gay thing to do is Sex”  👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Ryland is hilarious 🤣  Marry That Man!! 🤵
i love seeing u guys happy!!
Shane Dawson is scared of losing all of his money, proceeds to make a 25 minute "skit" in which he has already been threatened with a lawsuit once.   Dude, you're a pedophilic animal abuser. Just quit while you're ahead. Invest in some NFTs or something and live your life on your pile of cash. Stop making content and stop being problematic.
Hell no.
SHANE
Yes. Uk what I will watch this 😭
I was ready for this
Shane gives himself the hardest time, but he really shouldn't! He literally puts smiles on millions of faces ❤
since you’re BACKKKK can you do a JoJo series ☺️
This felt so nostalgic…I’ve missed these vids! 🥲🖤
Damn guess I be in a simulation in a simulation in a simulation
Why are all the comments positive? Fishy fishy making it stinky
I disagree that the voice in our heads is the person playing the game. I think there are three voices in our heads (sometimes more but they all come from the same place and they all sound like us: one is us, one is God and one is the devil (or demons).  The whole point of living is deciding who you are going to listen to and which voices you decide to act upon.
SHANE! Yess more content! Only 3 minutes in and I’m smiling and laughing!  This has been a great week! Also oh my god Podcast?!! Now talking about Chuck E. Cheese. This vid is such a rollercoaster, I love it!  😂😂
i honestly missed him
This is unexpected for 9:40am on a Wednesday. What a weekday
This was a great video! Shane lookin’ super sexy! I will watch your podcast! Omg! You could interview people that are haunted! The subject is Limitless!
So... Is it confirmed that Shane has ADHD or am I just speculating? I just find it funny how often he goes off track.  Edit: Why is the beauty room completely untouched? Are you just not into makeup anymore? Also, MatPat thinks the messed up pizza is due to the way it's cut, using a pretty dull large blade thing that shifts the pizza around while cutting it.
😂😂
i feel like I'm the only one uncomfy
I love you Shane, you've always helped me through my suicidal episodes since I was a young kid. Keep up the good work <3
It was actually not a bad video. Keep it up man I am still glad ur back
Oh my god Shane I have missed you sooo much I absolutely love your videos your so funny I can’t with you x
😂😂😂😂😂this vid is so good and funny
YES SHANE IS BACK
"You see me at Goodwill...buying my merch." Lmaooo. I will always love how humble you've stayed and your ability to poke fun at yourself.
that's is definitely not what 🅿️ means yay obv haven't heard gunna before
shane:doesnt want to cause anything also shane: *goes to chucky cheese expecting something better than last time*
Chucky cheese is not the 🅿️
OMG what a surprise !!
Shane this video is soooo good so glad you posted I missed you
❤💕❤💕❤💕❤💕
I’m so happy
💜💚🖤💛💛❣️🧡💖🧡💓❤️🧡💕
Y’all made my day y’all mad funny nd shit
Here comes the hate Shane Dawson youtubers 😂
OH MY, She is BACK!!!
Love you Shane ❤
LOVE YOU SHANE ❤️
back to the twilight zone of absolutely nothing happening for 43 minutes
❤❤❤❤
I would love a post cast!
Yey your back 🥺🥰 so glad my notifications were on
Yikes.
Omg I commented about “seeing an old friend after along time” before Shane said it! That’s exactly what I mean when I said our brains are just alike! 😂😂
Nice to see you again, sir
Cannoottttt wait for what’s next! So exciting And happy for u! 🙂
I'm really not okay with the fact that every single one of these comments is positive. You literally have your comments filtered for only the good things people say about you. You still haven't owned up to the shit you did. You just keep acting like nothing happened.
Yes I missed you so much
i love you
This was so much fun i always wanted a part 2 of this :)
Best notification I've had this year! ❤  4 minutes in & my ribs hurt from laughing 😂
You’re in frickin LA, like 5 minutes (okay more than 5 minutes) from Vegas. Just go get married in your nicest jeans. Who cares? Have a dressy party later to celebrate. Being married isn’t about one day. It’s about being together the rest of your life. ♥️
I worked i a pizza place.. we used a giant machete to cut the pizza, and some slices would be diff sized if the cut wrong lol
We finally getting Shane’s video welcome back Shane
I missed you Shane! I haven’t laughed this much in a while! Thank you for making my day and posting! 💙❤️🥰
I’m so glad you’re back!!
You just made my whole month by uploading!!!
this shook me to my core. I am honest to God thrilled to get through this!!
Holy s*** I needed this! I’ve been thinking about this actual theory for a while now… 🙏🏻❤️ Excited to see this play out & enjoying having you back. 🤗
Omg I can't watch you at work I'm lol to much
YAY!!!!!🥳🥳
TPE
I literally love any video you make. I am always so into it I feel there lol I love your series you make. I love the silly videos, I love the ghost videos, I love the conspiracy videos. They are all so good and it's because it's you! Keep them coming I live for them! And the long videos is my fav! It's like watching a movie 😘

This makes me so happy to watch and I’m super excited
Only 3 mins in but I am here for this. (I am here for anything you post) also a queen is looking snatched!!!

YouTube is NOT the same without you man😁
I missed this chaos

Crazy to think, I've been watching you since I was a kid and now I'm going to be a whole adult and I'm still here even after you went ghost for 3 months.
I definitely squealed when I saw the notification. We love you Shane!
Hi can we talk conspiracies again 🙌 😇
I'm so happy you're back Shane, you literally don't understand how much I love you platonically and emotionally and how long I've watched your content, it always makes my days less bad and makes me smile. It's like you're an old friend even though you aren't. Really enjoy any content you put out and hope you're happier these days.
How did the last podcast go..... ? Yea. No.
I was about to go to sleep! Nevermind! 😂
Thank you Shane for everything. I’ve loved your content for years and I always will. <3
I'd absolutely rock a tpe shirt 🤣
Hate to be that guy but you lost us

Bitch we made it! I love seeing you back been here since the beginning still here
I was having a horrible past couple of days, but this made everything so much better ❤ thank you!

Shaneee pushing 🅿️
Was not expecting this today-
Woah... I feel like I stepped right back into 2016 again.
Chuckee cheese is still around but NONE of the animatronics work...
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢 2022 gets worse and worse
Not gonna lie I miss this a lot! Thank you for this I was not having it today 😁
Seems like Ryland is always more afraid of Shane wanting to get with a girl than another guy..
Well now I know what the tea channels gonna be about tonight and tomorrow lol glad you are back Shane!! Was excited to see this notification!
So much sex talk. Like really. I don’t really want/need to hear all that.
I’m looking forward to a Shane iceberg.
I'm glad to see Shane happy and having fun
Forgot I still subbed to you thanks for reminding me to unsub
My heart just stopped seeing “Shane” just uploaded. ❤️❤️😩🥰 glad to see you back friend.
“Let’s wear a disguise,”   *wears his own merch*
Aaaaaanddddddddd he's back! Did a little dance when I got the notification! I have a vagina.
The editing and filming of this is IMMACULATE I am a few minutes in and already blown away. I can’t imagine how long this must’ve taken to put together
I wish I would find Murch at Goodwill🤣
I'm so happy that I got this notification. Please continue making more videos like this! You will always have my support ❤️ ...and marry him already 😍
Omgggg the podcast news 😍😍 Shane I can’t wait to listen! ❤️
I would totally listen to your podcast 🤍
Are you pushing 🅿️
QUEEN I AM SHAKING QUAKING WITH MY WHITE CHEDDAR CHEEZ ITS
left school early to watch this..
Excuses get married at the courthouse and have the wedding when you're ready
I heard that it’s actually the way they cut the pizza that makes the slices wonky
You guys bring me happiness and Chris is a gem I'm happy he's in/filming your videos.
Shane, I'm an ordained minister, wanna fly me out and get married at your house? I'd totally do it. Plus, it'd be good for both our youtube channels. LOL.   Seriously, I really am an ordained minister. I'll do it!!!
Finally 💕💕💕💕
I'm 13:39 into this video and all I can think is great creepy Shane is back🤢 what I've watched so far is disgusting. I'm not even going to finish watching this crap
We don’t want new content bye
Honestly Shane thank you
this is the first shane video I've watched in a long time. it's bitter sweet. it's very sad how people who were his friends just dropped him but I'm happy shane is moving forward, that's all anyone can really do.
yeah i think i've outgrown this humour
After a shitty day this is exactly what I needed I love you shane
SO HAPPY!!!😁
SHANE YOUR BACK??
I’ve literally never been more thrilled to see a notification on my phone
You know what's really weird..😬 like that "inner-voice" or whatev,when I'm alone and I decide to do something..I always say "we"! Like "so WE should have some Hot Tea or ohh let's watch this new video" it's as if it's me AND someone else 😳 Lol But I'm not schizophrenic or have any extra personalities(I don't think)😂 I donno why my inner-voice is WE
This is unbearable. I don't know why YouTube recommended this to me 😐
LOVE THE VIDEO SHANE❤️❤️❤️❤️
This was so lovely to wake up to!! I’m only half way through and I’m enjoying it so much !!
Tight pussy energy. I have not laughed this hard in so long 😂
BAHAHA Poor Emma! No more brand deals for ANYone! *throws confetti*
Ok. But I love you . So that’s that. Keep Instagram polls coming please lol you are amazing Shane. Don’t ever forget that

I'm so Glad your  back Shane I've been waiting!  Ur last series was great I hope your doing good, you and ryland :)
Adam and Eve sponsor Shane. He's being very sexual in this video. Lol

Any video that comes from u is awesome and hilarious. I really hope u and ryland r doing well and please make more videos. Love u guys ❤❤❤❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰🥰
I ways felt the same way when I was a kind about the  2000s it was like 1991 I was 4 an to me it seemd. Like. The  year 2000 was hundreds of years away  cause of watching old movies I really thought that's how the 2000s would be flying cars an robot house keeper s an what not in lol maybe in the we year 3000. To bad I was born in 2091 to see the flying cars an all the new crazy technology
Yess the shane is back !!!!!
Yasssssss!!!!!!!!!
starts the thought talking about why he's in LA and ends the thought with Ryland has a pussy, should hit that.  That was quite a flipping journey lol
Happy looks so good on you. This video was like welcoming back an old friend. I haven't been this happy or laughed this hard in a long time.
Miss our Shane
Shane dawson looking like Malibu's most wanted. I love it.
Not what I expected but so good! It’s so nice to see you happy and creative again. Can’t wait for more ❤️❤️
SHANE!!!
Before you know ,You don’t Know -Ryland  Adams
I forgot to unsubscribe
Yessss i missed you!
The 🅿️ just means “keeping it real” or “it’s a good thing”
can you make a documentary about getting jenna marbles back on YT
finishing school and seeing this notification 🥰
when you say this is probably not what we want- no, i am literally wanting ANY type or form of content that u release! so thank you for this xx
8:30 is absolutely hilarious
Forever a fan 😂 always has me laughing 😆 x
best thing to come home to :)
This video had me laughing non stop 😇😂😂
I love you, please do the podcast, it will bring me so much joy <3
my face when I got the notification ; 😧
DAng lol the title had my jaw dropped and worried but then seeing its another conspiracy episode so relifed lol YEAH LETS GO another new epic episode from a epic person!
A simulation ahahahahahah. My friend, yes, if you think that having an indivudual experience that you choose to do because you are everything you see and don't. Every molecule, space, alien, emotion, thought, everything. IS ONE. And you are an actor forgetting that , playing with yourself. Simulating separtation until you will get bored and become one once again. Sure then. But this is no game. It is The only game. The game you play with yourself cause you're bored. Simple. Try getting out of body sometimes instead. You'll learn more than whatever...you like to tell yourself so you stay intrested in the game cause knowing that really makes it all lose its....charm, urgency, stakes, etc. And you get depressed in another way than medicine can explain. Like me.
Wait, don’t flirt with Chris in front Ryland 🥺☹️

Bicoastal bisexual queen 😂 lmao ugh I missed Shane.

i MISS shane and friends first ever podcast i listened to still my favorite episode
Best surprise all day xx
Yay needed your videos right about now.
Yay!!!!
WE NEED tight pu$$y energy merch
I hope Shanes who support his return get sued and sentence to 500-1000hrs of community service
Hahaha Shane is me when anyone is on the phone 😂
Ohhh excited to see your brother back! Your past episodes with him are awesome.
I would love to see you talk about mental health in your new podcast or something about the true behind all the Hollywood stuff
I’m so glad to see this notification. My day is so much better now. 🖤
Shane there's actually 24 Marvel movies
Yes!!! Been waiting Shane!!!
Missed you so much Shane! ❤️
Me: I just can’t with this. So many tears because I saw something i shouldn't have seen about  Shane when I went tô nmnm.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor exboyfriend, “I am crying now" Shane, I have to say I admire your resilience and courage to stay true to yourself regardless of how many times and how many people try to throw hate your way and I can see how with time you've actually found the people who truly support, love and care for you. Thank you for being you and don't let anyone ever tell you anything otherwise
I really want him to post more imy sm!
i’ve never clicked so fast. i really have missed shane.
The person playing my game is definitely a feeder because they will not let me stop eating 🐷
I just want to have a fun happy day like Shane did.
Lol me starting to believe the brain conspiracy at the beginning of the video but then remembering that brain surgeries exist lol
P= POSITIVITY. Look up the song Pushin P LOL
Oh shit, I forgot Shane was gonna upload a new video today!
🅿️
WE MADE IT. I feel that.
I love how Shane talks at the beginning of the video as if we're not keeping up with him on Ryland’s vlogs LOL
Actually I prefer haunting videos over conspiracy videos but when it comes to you I'm just glad to get to watch ANY video because I adore you and think your content is amazing! ❤
missed you
we are not doing this
I’ve never been this early
Never stopped loving you, Shane. You looks so happy and healthy. FINALLY. You deserve it ❤️
I'm dieing laughing n I'm 14 min in 🤣😂 I love u Shane.
11:15 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwpL7lfdDYI&list=PLKSfl3OLDNrXhw3Pz3Gv9DZumck1T30ro&index=2
Cool
Now that dislikes counts are hidden, Shane can make his comeback. 😂😂😂🤣
No offense to his brother but he seems very into conspiracy theories and not all are rooted in fact. I’m so tired of hearing “wErE iN a SiMuLaTiOn” like no we’re fucking not.
If so mines got a really horrible life... Esp the last year lol.
I haven't laughed in a while, thank you Shane
Shane do you like the new scream movie
Welcome back! I missed you ❤️
We get Shane but Jenna marbles will never come back on YouTube like what???
So excited to watch this, What a nice surprise to pop up on my feed. Will always love you shane! Keep thriving 🤍🤍
I'd watch anything you post honestly. You're so interesting and funny and sarcastic.. so any upload of yours makes my day
I’m just so happy you’re still around. You bring a lot of peace to your viewers and thank you for staying true to yourself and your supporters.
Screaming crying throwing up
More Shane? Yes please ❤️
Podcast is a great idea, but you should record it for YouTube the way Joe Rogan does it.
SHANE please do another series like texas or queen mary we need it
❤❤❤❤❤ I'm so happy your back
I love your videos like this !! you seem so much happier now. im proud of you Shane
When Shane said all the guest left that hit different 😭 love you Shane
Missed you 🦋❤️
BRING BACK THE SCARY CHALLENGES PLSSS🤍🤍🤍
OMG I literally woke up to this notification. So glad that Shane is baaaaack! 😍
Damn Shane happy to see you back I haven’t laughed like this in a while
Only 13 minutes in and have LOLd more than I thought I would. Didn’t know how much I missed Shane.
Yay new video :D
SHUT UP GUYS SHANE UPLOADED
“We’re losing the straight audience” said like they were ever here
Mad respect for the amount of work Shane puts into getting to eat pizza and not feel guilty.
Sam and colby mentioned you when they were in chuck n cheese 😄
I haven't laughed that hard in awhile. I really enjoyed this video. Keep em coming ,you're still everything.
Why did you get a manly truck ?
You wink well 😭 Ryland being a genuine sweetie. Plus he does 🤷🏻‍♀️
Welcome back 😀
SO MUCH LOVE FROM THE UK
Wasn't expecting that notification but I'm happy your back!!! ❤
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😍😍😍😍😍😍 yasss queen
Guess who’s back
IF YOU DO ANOTHER PODCAST MAKE IT A VIDEO PODCAST! Like the sip! Pleeeeease! Lol
If the player controlling me can use the sims motherload money cheat for me that will be much appreciated lol
I think anything Shane says on a podcast is gonna get ripped apart and people will try to cancel him again. Do you guys not see how many accounts on tiktok completely destroy the people who say anything on podcasts? It's pretty harsh...
“And that why your still here”
SHANE 🅿️ means pushing products but people use it as a joke 😭
Why are you sexualizing a young woman who clearly doesn't use that tone to sell her products? This is exactly why you got in trouble for your inappropriate behavior. I obviously stayed subscribed because I was sure you understood how inappropriate your jokes where and you would change the behavior. This has proven that you have no awareness and your tone deaf. Please stop sexualizing woman it's so inappropriate.
Yes Queens!!!! Be yourself Shane... we love you... you seem so happy <3 would love to see you and Ryland get married on your new property.... would be magical...much love <3
Anyone else just feel at home, whilst watching Shane's videos ❤
I love Shane and you guys already took Jenna Marbles from me! YOU WILL NOT TAKE SHANE AWAY 😌
pushing 🅿️ means keeping it real LMAO. What does 🅿️ by itself mean though?
I'm so old it was literally ShowBiz pizza when I was a kid...😏
Welcome back shane we missed your videos!
I cannot believe this still needs to be said…the CEC pizza is NOT and will never be recycled. They are held to the same food and health sanitation standards as any other restaurant. I worked in a lead position at the company for 5 yrs.  #1: the dough is literally shaped by hand by 16-18yo kids (most of the time) which is then sauced by hand and not always symmetrical.   #2: the crust is put on a screen before going into the oven and the dough will stick to the screen if not enough semolina is used. Sometimes the bottom of the pizza needs to be scraped from the screen and part of the pizza may come off.  #3: when the pizza comes out of the oven, it’s 500 degrees and the cheese and toppings slide very easily. When it’s cut, sometimes the cheese or toppings slide off and get stuck on the large knife or cutting board which is why you’ll sometimes see half a pepperoni slice.   Please keep in mind that the kitchen staff at CEC are typically HS students who aren’t qualified and trained chefs.
I miss podcasting. Wasn't ever heavy into it but I had a couple friends where they weren't going to quit trying. That was fun. It's supposed to be a lot of fun. So many extremely different people's personalities and they come talk about the way they each experience the world and we tried to do this weekly-biweekly.
I will always be on your side Shane Yes you were under a SH*t load of stress for a long time but things will keep getting every day.
I haven’t even gotten to 5 minutes into the video and I just wanted to comment n let you know that I’ve always supported you for 11 years, and will continue to do so. I’m so happy you’re starting to make content again❤️❤️❤️
Uhhh he’s really extra w the cameraman and you can tell it makes ryland uncomfortable
Literally 20 minutes into this and wondering how the fuck I just sat here and laughed like I was actually in this conversation 🤣 missed you Shane.
But for real! Take off that mask! You dont need to be a republican to know common sense.
KING ily I'm so happy you're back, keep it coming!!
Why so mean to ryland 🤨
What did I just watch?
Thank God he's "giving back" by doing a podcast, that will really help the suicidal people😂😂 the podcast should be called "giving back- the alternative revenue stream"😂😂
🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿🅿
Shane is back ❤️❤️❤️❤️
this was EVERYTHING we wanted, thank you for letting us hang out with you. Missed you 💗
Love ur videos watching in dundee Scotland shane ❤ xxx
welcome back Shane😭❤️
It's the lawsuit for me
Shane. You're not one of my favorite YouTubers. You are my favorite YouTuber.  And I know you've been through hell and back many, many times. But I love you and your jokes. I will always stand with you no matter what. Just know, some people won't always have the same sense of humor as you, and will always think something is offensive.  But aside from that, there are many people who love you. And everytime a notification pops up telling me that you posted a video, just know, I'm watching every. Single. One.😌 lysm shane❤ have a good day, and you have to update us with a wedding video in the future.
I love that I’m not seeing any of the negative comments, over 100k views and only 3.3k comments that are all positive? Please.
all i know is the the next 43 minutes are going to be ✨😌✨ thank you for this blessing shane
"If you're watchin this video.. u get it" yuuup honey, I sure do
Really not a good look, is this whole video ment to be a joke?
PLEASE DO A PODCAST OHYMGOD
SHANEEEEE!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m sooo happy you posted thank you for putting a smile on my face today
I need this kind of video every day!!!!
“It’s the 🅿️ for me”
I clicked hoping for something entertaining but this was just vulgar/cringe/made me uncomfortable.
Glad to see you back ♡  glad you're selling the LA home...You two are both better off in CO. Good luck on the podcast...we'll be there!! ♡
hey wonderfl person reading this comment! hope you have a wonderful day stay safe :)
I love how natural you are. Haven't recorded in years/months and its still the same Shane. I LOVE IT!!!
I was soooo excited when I got the notification ❤️ So happy you‘re back! ❤️
This was the most exciting notification!!! 🤟
I love you shane!!
WE MISSED YOU
Awww haha poor ryland
You make my day every time I watch you. I'm a sarcastic bitch too so don't let people get you down. People look to be offended about ANYTHING! The Santa at our mall isn't allowed to say "ho, ho, ho" anymore because some twit thought he was insulting her. No, I am not kidding. Live life on your terms honey!! BTW I had a friend who called me Pooh in high school, I called him Eeyore. It took him 2 years to figure out I was calling him a jackass 😉 love you too Ryland 😘 💖
She means you need to open your throat chakra
Wow, finally. So glad ur back Shane. Missed u so much. Cant wait for more videos to come. Much love from Massachusetts
Missed YOUUUU
Ya'll can say whatever you want about it, if you need a good hour long distraction a shane documentary always slaps
SHANE!!!!!!!!!!!!!   hi🥰
This is unwatchable lol
Perfect timing! Yay!
I'd love to be on and listen to this podcast
I know you tried to talk yourself out of posting a video for awhile but I'm glad the bad thoughts didn't win as we're always happy to see your work Shane 😊
You don't know how happy I get when I see one of your videos. 👏👏👏👏👏
i love you shane
I've NEVER clicked on a video so fast. I missed you so much Shane!!
Wow. I wonder how a psychic could know about suicidal thoughts of a celebrity that's always have been open about mental health. Weird.
also I would binge a Shane podcast so hard
God I love you. The internet did you so wrong. Im so glad we made it too haha. 2022
Okay but I'd definitely wear the TPE shirt lmao make it Shane
I don't care what I'm doing I stop everything when I get notifications that you posted 😂😂😂
I want to know what Chuck E. Cheese has a ball pit because MINE DOESNT💔
I MISSED SHANE SO MUCH OMG I CLICKED SO FAST
Lol. Make what ever video you want. I'll watch regardless.
Any Shane content, I’ll take it.
Thank God it’s not another drama video, it’s nice to just see people exist and create whatever the hell they want.
The next video: “Having a Throuple with Emma Chamberlain”
Can I just say!!! You look amazing! Your glowing! You look happy and healthy my love!! Go Shane!!
Damn Shane ain't 🅿 that's sad.....
I love this video. Missed your videos Shane. I go excited to see this new video.
ITS PUSHING 🅿️ Shane😭😭😭😭 ITS A RAP SONG, look it up
As soon as I thought I couldn’t love Shane more he started watching marvel
I got goosebumps when you talk about getting the idea randomly at the car ride about communicating about important topics 🙀😻
i so prefer this to conspiracy videos.. i love them too but just really love this type of video!! i am so excited!
It’s pushin p that’s what it mean idk what it means but yeah😂😂😂😜

I literally blew off my friends in a voice call to go watch this video. Love you and Ryland!
Welcome back Shane!
THE DISCLAIMERS WERE KILLING ME😂😂😂
So glad your back Shane!!!
shane ily but i can’t help but notice how much different you act in your videos compared to when you are in rylands. you seem very genuine in rylands but a little less raw in yours. it’s interesting to see the different moods of you.
YAY!!
Ty for making videos again!
I need that bean bag thing
Yassss finally a video from you..missed u ❤
I do absolutely love conspiracy videos, however I’m sure I’m not the only one when I say… I love all the videos you make and to get this notification was so exciting!!💞💞

First 2 seconds and he has me excited for the next one already
Do it shane ! what's the worst that can happen? You get canceled... so many are here for you
why did I think it was Jeffree star on your shirt for a second
I got a pack of eye contacts in 2019 and the expiry was set for 2022. I thought to myself, will I even be around then? 😂💀 Makes sense of why I love your content. It's relatable!
Saw the notification I couldn't click fast enough been a fam since I was 10 love the vids Shane
Ryland I've been engaged for 8 years and still not got married lol, mind I've had 3 kids and my aunt was really sick with cancer and my fiances nan had it too amongst other things so it never happened, we will get our big day one day Ryland I just know it❤️🇮🇪
I would love a podcast. I missed the era of your first one years ago so this would be cool. ❤️

Your gonna make me so happy if you make a podcast. I’ve been waiting for this for a long time. Your gonna make life a little easier. Thankyou
I love them so much 💝
A message from your Conspiracy Theorist brother. We accepted the reality that was presented to us. We live in a prison planet. There is no escape but through our faith.
So happy your back!
I am down with the TPE merch!
Shane you should rated this episode XX . Oh my goodness laughing so hard .   When ever said Christopher Robin I was like yes . I answered you . My dad used to call me that .. so cute you have a nickname for your friend. If not sure call Chris (Chrissy Pooh )
Collaborate With The Sidemen....
Omg I can not wait for the conspiracy video with Jerid!!
I have never been happier to see a notification on my phone. I love seeing you happy. 🖤🥺👽
stay strong shane ❤️
Been watching for SO many years. You’ve always had my support and always will. You’re a fantastic person who brings happiness and light to a lot of people! CANT WAIT FOR THIS VIDEO!❤️❤️❤️
You should be a republican! We wouldn't cancel you!!!! It's nice here
Hiii
Omg when ryland said “tight” I LAUGED SO LOUD I scared my kids 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lets go!! A new Shane video on my birthday!! 🥳🥳🥳
Awesome ❤️☮️😀🇦🇺
I get it.
I don’t know what this is  But I am fucking here for it
Love this and your energy
Not Shane’s Bro Brogan Brother giving him very bad psychological advice.
I missed you so much! I've watched you from day 1! Love you! Your content is what keeps me on this channel :) Glad to see you back! Keep it coming!
I’m ready for the tea channels to make a video about this
Getting this notification makes me so happy! And I'm happy that you're happy and enjoying life again🥰 Keep making what you love and we'll continue to love and support you❤
Omg shane!! I'd LOVE for you to do a podcast again!! And I'm so excited to see the next conspiracy video. Glad you're getting back into the swing of YouTube. Btw I still totally believe Chuck E Cheese 🧀 recycles their pizza. It's sooo obvious the pieces don't fit together. If it was one solid pizza...they wouldn’t line up like that.
Yayy
You dreamed of a nookie because Jesus is trying to save you from hades
Is it bad that I know when this was filmed based on the Crumbl cookies? 😂
I didn’t expect this but it was perfect timing! I just left work!
yay Shane ur back <333
Shane: "Oh"

Seen this. Immediately screamed. Anything from you is gonna be awesome!! LOVE seeing new content!!
If you don’t at least reach out to Jessie and see if she wants to co-host
Thank you for the upload I needed this right now! Shane's my favorite!
Shane, some of us will not forget about your problematic past.  It's so unfair that people like you get to see success.
You should have señor Pooh on a sweatshirt that says t-pe, with Christopher Robin 😂
this video is fucking everything 😍
“But until then here’s something you don’t want.” 😂 We want all the content Shane. We don’t care what it is
I love Shane and his videos!!! His personality is just amazing to me and he can always make me smile...need more videos on a regular basis... I love the crazy no point videos!!! Perfect timing on this video really needed it today!!!
I am sooooo happy for this video!!!
I love the idea you you interviewing people on a podcast 💕💕 i miss you

Completely shook to see the notification.   I definitely feel like I'm being "played" in a simulation most days.  I have been enjoying my "mystery" hoodie & shirt btw! I got the exact shirt I was hoping for & the hoodie is comfy & not too thick.  It's not a color I'd usually wear but it has grown on me. 🤗
6:18 Chris Crumbl was right there...
PLEASE make a tight pussy energy shirt
What a good reminder to unfollow, thank you!!

Well…this is new. I’m unsure how to feel.
You need to link some BLM charities and donate in recognition and support of black history month
wasnt expecting this when i got home
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg just to see your post made my day 💜💜 not gonna lie I just ate shit outside and split open my toe but this made me feel so much better 🥰😂
I’m WHEEZING at all the tight vagina jokes. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love how this is just a chamberlain coffee ad that nobody asked for
oh no
Not sure what the point of this was…
❤️❤️❤️
Nobody wants a conspiracy video to be honest.
I'm so glad to have you back 💓
I’m glad ur back 🥰 I missed ur vids.
Rylandussy
I'm so happy!!! Any day shane drops a video is the best day everrr!!!

A few minutes in and I'm dying over the Jaime Lynn part 🤣🤣
I enjoyed watching it!  Love seeing you guys. I love seeing u guys so happy!
My eyes almost popped out when this popped up
Omg yessss she’s back!❤️
I've always had the simulation theory.
Chris nearly wheezing from laughing is a mood.
That conspiracy at the beginning is funny cause who ever was controlling my game would’ve powered it down and got their money back soooo…I wouldn’t even wanna play lol
YESSSSS SIR THE KING HAS UPLOADED, This is what I’ve needed
OMGGg IM LiTERALLy laughing throughout the whole thing I can’t even 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀💀💀🤩🤩
Yeaaahhhhh Shane
Why did he build up hype in the beginning
Looking forward to new content
Shane. Read about Dolores Cannon and the 3 waves of volunteers. I think you would be FASCINATED!!!!
Oh, oh, oh, oh Ryland! Is so gay!
YAAAASSSS❤️❤️❤️
I FUCKING LOVE SEEING SHANE HAPPY AND LIVING HIS BEST LIFE! ❤️
Nobody:  Shane: look at this looks good right? Uh anyways so
Love you shane. I’m 10 min in and I have to wait to watch this I just got my wisdom teeth out and I’m going to pop a stitch. Lmfao
We’re all so proud of you pig ❤️
Please go away
7:46 “We’re losing the straight audience…. Uhbubu , MARVEL MARVEL” 💀 FUCKING STOPPP 🤣🤣
I never tap my screen so fast!
so happy that you’re back again<3!! missed yaaa
Omg omg omg omg.... Its up its up gahhhhh ....
Glad you're doing what you love again. I'll say that I've personally been experiencing the worst time of my entire life these last few months, but watching this today gave me a little break from all the sadness.
is this what ADHD feels like?
Shane's dream killed me 😭
Happy “V” Day, Ryland! 🙃
I relate to you so much some how hahhaha
Love this!!!! Missed you and ryland ❤️
Always a good day for a God damn Shane video 😍😍🥰
Love you Shane!❤️
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗😍
SHANEEEE WHEREEEE HAVEEE YOU BEEENNNN I MISSSS YOUUUUUU
Bi-yourself
Technically Ryland would be a Twink and Shane would be a cub But that’s if people really cared about the cliché boxes people put people in
OMG had such a rough weekend and start to the week this video of you is just what I needed and I am sure others did as well post more often.
PODCAST?!?!?! I will happy cry! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 omg….*honk* 🤣😂
Just a few minutes in… you look so much happier and healthier Shane !
I have to go to sleep but I can't wait to watch in the morning ✌🏻
So all I'm getting from this is Shane is trying to force himself to be creative when his entire life fell apart and he's not in love with Ryland.
Ahhh I've been waiting for this! After being teased about it. So happy your back and SO happy your starting to be at peace! Love you and Ryland so much. Keep doing what ya'll are doing!
I know he's back
shane the reason people hate you is because they want to have that fying pig neon sign the fans are shook
It So good to see you on my timeline again ❤️
So like an apology for everything is just non existent ?
Yessss this is what we needed..🙌♥️♥️
Only 10 mins in n I’m in tears 😂
I'm gonna call you Chris.....tmas hahahahahaha
Old Shane is back and I'm 100% here for it! ❤
Atp you need a TV show ….. a Netflix series
welcome back Shane
So excited to see content from you! All my love and support for you on your journey!
Love it Shane!!!! Keep going and stay positive!
First of all, I want whatever video you want to make 😊🤗
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO A PODCAST OMG THAT WOULD MAKE ME SO HAPPY 🥺🥺❤️❤️
Finally! Miss you shane!!
So excited to have you back. I check your account so often
I miss when Shane use to honk or whatever, I totally forgot about it until Ryan brought it up but that was an era of Shane I miss and hope we can go back too just without the bad and only the good. (Idk if that makes sense lol)
OMG PLEASE DO A PODCAST! and make it like spooky, and conspiracy theories and just like life updates!
My player isn’t doing a great job…..
Yesssss you need a podcast
I miss this kinda energy from his videos 🥺🥺
Ryland living his kris Jenner moment lmao
The idea of a podcast would be so ICONIC!!!!!
VERY EXCITED FOR YOUR NEW CONSPIRACY VIDEOS !!
20k likes in 7 minutes….. Shane you’re a fucking Queen and I fucking love you I’m so glad you’re back
I MISSED YOU SHANE

no one will want to be on your podcast lmfao
I'm so happy you're back 😊❤️
im so thankful your back , i believe you have truly changed not just because of your recent actions but the people around you. stay safe
I'm just so excited that you're back & creating content again ❤️ so many of us have just missed your presence!
YOU SEE ME AT GOODWILL LMAOOOO I missed Shane so much
I love you Shane 🥺💕
Okaaaaaaaaay
I stopped watching when the word fa***** was used. Disappointed.
10:42 Podcast revival?
SHANE YOUR BACK!! I missed you and your content so much! Such a surprise:)) happy to see again!
YES YOU POSTED, my day just got so much better
Shane, I have to say I admire your resilience and courage to stay true to yourself regardless of how many times and how many people try to throw hate your way and I can see how with time you've actually found the people who truly support, love and care for you. Thank you for being you and don't let anyone ever tell you anything otherwise :)
Wish u the best
Honestly this video sucked. Nothing about it was good. He should've just cut his loses and been done with YouTube and moved on to his 'movies' 🤣
8 min in and my day is already better!! welcome back
Sorry I’m with Ryan on this one set the dam date already Shane Ryan wants to get married it’s been long enough boy !!
oh wow I'M SO early to this. I am sooo curious. You haven't posted in FOREVER!!!
IT CAN’T BE HELPED SHANE STILL MAKES ME CRACK UP
Imagine a Jamie Lynn Spears derides about the whole Brittney conservatorship.
When Shane stopped posting my life stopped and now he’s posting again I just like can’t - I love u Shane 🥰
Pushing "P" it's from a song
at least shane will be able to celebrate 20 million subscribers again
Hey
I do hope you get sued, especially after the last couple minutes of this video. The sarcasm is just unnecessary. Deflecting because you ruined a company and are the reason a lot of employees lost their jobs is disgusting.
💜💜💜💜💜
Am I lucid dreaming or new video just came out? I just had a strangest feeling like it’s not a real Shane video but a montage of a bunch of a previous videos…
Shane literally doesn’t understand how much these videos mean to us💙 Thank you Shane!
SHANE IS BACK!!!! YAASSS im just so happy <3  "im Jamie lyn"   bahahaha
So much ZZZ content that could be cutted out...
hold on shane looks skinnyyyy
I forget how long you make your videos, half of the video is just you rambling and kinda wasting time
he is not funny to me anymore
Are you going to do a come back
We have more than five senses
Love you Shane !!
so happy you’re back shane <3
I am so happy to see a video of yours!!! You just made my day so much better!! ❤️ thank you!!
SHANEEEEEE 😭😭🤲🏼

Omg HEY SHANE... im so happy your back.. and we miss you <3 🥰🤩
Yay yay yay.

We are in a matrix
Wow so he is back? :/
I need some xl merch plz re stock lol and yes yes yes podcast plz I’ve herd all your old 1s a thousand times lol We don’t have Chuck e cheese in the uk thank god and fyi I need that conspiracy jacket
Did you see the new scream movie and if so, did you like it?
SCREAMING AND CRYING
Go to the courthouse and get married!!! My husband and I did it 15 years ago. I hate ceremony and attention also. Screw the ceremony. Just you, him and your families go to the courthouse! I got married in jeans lol
TYSMM FOR COMING BACK IM SO HAPPY RN
LEAVE RYLAND ALONE! Very happy ur doing videos again btw
Hi dad!!!
YASSSS QUEEN SHANE IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!
I miss you Shane 😭 Yes..TPE merch!!!
Yaaaaaaaayyyyy. I was so tempted to say...If you need a Piglet with a poontang...Hi. Lmao
This is just u being cheesey. Its not about anything
I LOVE YOU OMG
YESSS QUEEEEN ❤️ I'm as happy as a pig in shite seeing this, much love 🥰
Love this!
So excited to watch this, I’m going to watch it while I eat in a few hours 🥴
Oh?
I can have a bad day and watch his video's and just be happy again
Shane is so funny 😂😂😂
Ryland's comment cracks me up. I used to work with this electrician and his favorite saying was "You can't know what you don't know".
Shane is this the video you made in your LA home?!? The one you mentioned on ryland's vlog!!!
Never clicked so fast
“It made me Republican! Take off that mask”  Hahaha Shane you’re killing me in the first few minutes
I almost fell of tired mill.
Hope he can get back into YouTube without beinh bullied  I don't get why he got canceled for making edgy jokes? I bet all those ppl who got angry also watch the office or South Park?? At what point does someone become famous enough to use dark humor?
So excited for the upcoming conspiracy theories vid with Jeridddd been wanting you guys to film another conspiracy vid again for forever!!!
SHANE! I missed you so much!! Better days are to come , you already know that! I love you!💕
Just call him Chris Crumbls
WHEN CHRIStina STUMBLES ON THE STAIRS AND SHANE SUDDENLY GETS INTO THE LENS WITH A LOOK OF WORRY HAD ME DYING😂😂😂  8:30
Still saying he’s “Bi” 🥱
Shane! I've missed seeing you upload, I'm excited you're back!
I love you being back!!! I missed you!!!
Welcome back Shane I missed you
Not even half way through but I love you so much please keep posting we all miss you ♥︎シ
Who is this dollar store David dobrik recording you
I mean I expected that you'll come back, but I wasn't expecting thisssss
Am I sitting here watching it when it was at 57 views and that shit skyrocketed? Yes, yes I am
I didn't even have to watch the whole video to know that Shane is putting on a character out of anxiety. The majority of laughs are fake laughs, and this is a really disappointing grab for content. If you really want to come back to the internet I'd recommend to stop masking in front of the camera, and be more genuine and mature. This is the minimum people expects from adults, ESPECIALLY after heavy backlash.
"it made me a republican! I'm just kidding....take off that mask" lololol
Shane Dawson what a delight to see you back strong and shining the world missed you you have plenty to share and plenty to offer taking a break is fine but looking forward to your podcast and all your new videos good luck keep shining
I bet you didn’t expect me to pull up in a truck., ha I’m republican .. ha take off my mask  Literally died 😂
I'm absolutely so happy that you're back Shane! 😃😊💙🖤💜💕💞
omg shane, who's your favorite avenger?
Everyone shut up Shane posted.
I miss "don't ask dont tell" at least people had dignity back then. Now every 🌈 competing to see how vile they can be. Gross af
FINALLY SHANE!!!!!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿🙋🏿‍♀️
Hearing about why their not married makes me sad, you can tell how much ryland want it
Chris'new nickname: Chris crumble
Love seeing your notification come up on my phone so happy you’re back to YouTube Shane we’ve all missed and love you!
The person inside my head has a lot of anxiety then
Please make a disney land vlog 😩✨
How he says Crumbl is adorable 😂
Never been so excited to see someone upload.
shane i love you you make me smile
been so missed 🖤
You’re gonna pick it up shane we love you
You post this the moment I’m going to bed! Oh well staying up an extra hour now.
Y’all can’t really be accepting him, y’all know what he’s done right?
Good to see you again, Shane. 🖤
You know when you're fat when you know when this was filmed based off of the Crumbl  flavors.
Under 1M views ik this is going to be on the drama channels.
I guess all these “fans” that are saying “Welcome Back, WE missed you!” Didn’t watch the 3 part series you did in Colorado over the ghosts/bridge videos?!?! *I DID!* I’m glad to see another video! Made my day! 😘♥️
Your videos always make me smile😊
It feels like we have you back, you’re so naturally funny 😄 I love that!
I knew it
I think Shane's dream of Ryland having a vagina is because he's the girl in their relationship.
❤️❤️❤️

Finally 😍😍😍😍😍😍
You're back! 😁 Science has revealed that your soul is hosted by your heart so I think your brain is kind of just your smartphone or computer and it auto-populates thoughts and ideas and scenarios for you.
It is good to see you are happy with the life you have now Shane. Yes there has been some negativity within your life, but you chose to rise above it. I hope one day you will make another horror movie.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
i've missed this
So happy you're back!!
Hey Shane It's High Time To Comeback...We Miss You ☹️

Yes so excited we need more content pretty please with a cherry on top 😊
Clicked on this video so fast
I CANT WAIT FOR THE SIMULATION CONSPIRACY THEORY !!! I've had the same theory for YEARS!! That EXACT thought he said.
My daughter worked at Chucke E Cheese for 8 months.   If you see what they use and how they cut the pizza, the uneven slices will make sense.   It’s the same pizza.   Not other peoples leftovers.
Shut the frunk up shane Dawson
Crying laughing already hahahahahha

I literally dropped everything I was doing to watch this ❤️
I’m going to be blasted for this but oh well. I have a recurring dream where Shane and I are like flirting and I have a chance with him. It’s kinda sad to wake up and know it’ll never happen. I’ve had a crush on him for over 7 years.
I missed uno

Haven’t even watched a minute of the video and I’m BEAMING with happiness I’ve missed your videos so much!
his voice triggers so many memories of our childhood.. love him or hate him, we really grew up watching his videos, I’m happy to see him back.
No more conspiracy videos please. They're not very good and potentially super damaging for our society.
Glad you’re back
I love you .
Who says I ‘don’t want’ this!? ❤️❤️
You know it’s a good video if it’s long
Then why TF did my user choose this DISGUSTING body as it’s avatar?
Are you high you look high
Shene I am here since day one I'll be here for the end
This had me dying laughing! Great video Shane, we will always stan :) Love from Colorado

WAIT WHAT IS HAPPENING LOL
“Biii…biiii my merchh! 😃” 😂
So happy to see you with your brother!
I was in a shitty mood, but now I’m not because I have new Shane content. Yay!

Hi Shane! :D
Yaaaaaaaassssssssssssssss       shane  you got people here for you! Don't ever  go away   keep living your life!!
I adore you! SO PROUD OF YOU. Keep going, king. 🤍
As a republican and you saying “take off that mask” I DIED
Pleaseeee do a conspiracy video but don’t make it all about the simulation theory… if it’s a small part that’s fine but don’t make it all about that. That’s one of the most outlandish ones and the reason we like your conspiracy videos is the fact you are able to explain them in a way which could possibly be true, which makes them interesting!
No we don’t want a new conspiracy video, we don’t want any videos from you
Queen Shane
so excited to watch this 🥰
IM FREAKING OUT!! SOOOOO HAPPY
Is the lawsuit is why he don’t do conspiracy theories anymore? I thought the government shh him lmao and don’t really watch anything else he does
so glad you’re back 🖤
Yayyyy new video!😊❤
Yasss your back  🧡🧡🧡🧡
So glad you’re back shane
6th viewer babyyyyy 🥳
Proud of you Shane!! Glad you are back!!!

Uh, what? This surprised me. Shane comes out of nowhere with a video about lawsuits and us living in a simulation and all sorts of weird stuff? But it's also like, a vlog??? I wouldn't have predicted that, but, I'm sure this'll be a great video... Shane _is_ super talented. Let's see....  Must be rad to just be able to make whatever video you want and know tons of people will watch.
