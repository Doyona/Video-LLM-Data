This was definitely a video that vik came up with
JJ being so hyped for Tobi is so wholesome.
Don’t text that to Philly now 🤣 12:05
Cringe but amazing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
8:11 i cringed so hard
14:04 it should have been tanner and mully 😂
Did simon go to school in the 1870s bro looks like he is 40
11:46 not them impersonating filly bro 😭
1:50 Choosing the fat lion from the fat animals Sidemen Reacts video as Josh’s Mum’s profile is mental 😭
YungFilly in this video. Yikes!😂
17:54 SIMON 😧😭
10:00 HELL PLD THE HABIBIS J VANT BREATHEE 😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏
Worst part about them thinking about elliot and tannar having a 3some is the fact that thoes two are sinlings
10:42 watching this in 2025 💀
W vik
when he saidj Filly's active XD
Nobody talking about Harry’s fort on the right
More more 👍
filly!! this didn't age well
Make there a point goal like so maybe first to reach 50 or 100 so theres multiple rounds, and just to add more randomization, before each round reshuffle the decks
Have you ever started a band ?
Gotta do more of these text games lads pure entertainment
If he loses is he gonna jump him in the car park or something so he can say that he beat him 😂
I like how the game brings not just your friend group in, but also brings others with your joy to share with, even if its just jokes
i thought this was recent 💀 gasped when they actually messaged filly 😭
I hope Lazar watched this
These filly texts have not aged well.
Let's go Tobi!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I can’t find an update or part two
10:00 tobi got the rizz
18:25 there was a bird that flew outside the window. That scared me
0:20 OOOH
Later that week tobi was in Dubai 😂
Toni how was your date
this is fun
Bože dragi top šut
Ofcourse there not really texting so fake btw
pls watch 9:50 to 10:15 on slo mo im dyinggggggg
Where can you get the game
Thumbnail is diabolical
TOBI IS THE RIZZLER
12 min 30 sec i am a liar I am a liar  I am a liar

Tobi's feet hanging off the couch has me cackling
wow.. this aged badly with the charges filly is facing now., plus the message j.j had to send aged badly in a way too.
Good video bro, keep it up!
heybibi????????????????????????
in the nicest way possible this video was the  epitome of a teenage girl sleepover cry
11:37 picked the driest one ffs
I would’ve said ‘bet’ after the yh habibi…or SOMETHINF
filly mention here
Fun fact the only people in my contacts are mod and my Dad and my sister and probably some random shopkeeper
Imagine if they did this now with the filly situation
7:55 LOL THE EDITING
1:03 yep that would be helpful for him to crush stuff on his table😂
THAT ETHAN BRAH U ALRIGHT WAS PERFECT😂
Am I confused, or should the person whose card has been picked get the point?
10:43.... its actually him!!!!
I cannot stop laughing because of KSI When he just said send a tex his friend Yung FILLY when he just said I open the door for You ❤🎉
Yeah Habibi  Is one fav always 😂😂😂
From TBJZL to TBRZL
What’s even happened w filly between the Australia thing
Didn't anyone else notice that tobi switched out the phones when texting the girl?
10:50 oh no no no
Filly 😬😬😬😬😬
Filly😂
Rumor has it a year later Josh’s mom still hasn’t replied to any of his texts
11:03 what was that in the background a few seconrs asgo
11:20 this all makes sense now
P FILLY
10:45 didn't age well. I don't think he's active now!
Hi
10:43 didn’t age well
Yung fillys ironic 💀
Here after the filly situation 😬😭
part 2
10:19 disclaimer is wild!!!
Bots are getting insane
Need another one of these 👌🏼
Tobrizzle
The filly slander hits hard.
Events at 4rabet are always better when Finch is around he brings the crowd and the credibility
Having Aaron Finch at 4ra events spells quality and trust his presence is a big win
I'm skeptical though. I've heard mixed reviews. Some say it's great, others not so much
Yeah, 4RAB is the best for betting. I love it.
Aaron Finch at 4ra events adds a spark of reliability and quality, always a crowd-puller
Having Aaron Finch at 4ra events spells quality and trust his presence is a big win
Having Aaron Finch at 4ra events spells quality and trust his presence is a big win
I'm more into the casino games they offer. The slots are pretty addictive
I'm more into the casino games they offer. The slots are pretty addictive
No way! 4ra is that good? I'm thinking to join too.
Really, man? My friend recommended 4rabet to me too.
Aaron Finch as the face of 4rabet  just elevates everything his sports creds are just unmatched
True that Life's too short to not have a bit of excitement. Count me in for some 4rabet action
I feel you! It's easy to get carried away. Just set a budget and stick to it, right
Yeah, my friend tried it and had a blast. But you know how it is, everyone's experience is different
So, what's the deal with 4rabet
Aaron Finch at 4ra events adds a spark of reliability and quality, always a crowd-puller
Finch representing 4rabet is a sure sign of excellence his professional achievements add value
Aaron Finch with 4rabet makes every event feel more prestigious his track record speaks for itself
4ra with Finch onboard means serious class his acting and sports achievements light up the place
Alright let's do it May the odds be ever in our favor
Exactly Gotta gamble responsibly But hey a little fun never hurt anyone right
My brother's been raving about it! He says it's the place to be for sports betting
Respect to Vik for opting out very good guy
Pt2 when
I have 2 contacts in my phone I couldn't play this.
1:23
1:23
Ngl Simon was so Funny this video man😂
rizz
No one talking about how vik got aired
this is so funny🤣
Is it me or is harry just normally really fine? He is absolutely stunning!
8:00 LMFAO TOBI 😂
Lol
The icon for joshes mom 😭🤣
Should be forfeits for people who don’t send the message
Soon to come cards against humanity vid?????
Tobi won the game and a date that's what i call a lucky cheeky b......
name of the game?
Habibi means my love
13:53 poor Vik man 😂
9:46 Tobi is an innocent man.
Of course Harry, the one from Guernsey, chose "I've always been attracted to you!" for Josh's mom. 🤣🤣 Edit: Guernsey is known for inbreeding, that's why its funny
Lucy's are always Ws
14:57 He's regretting beefing with harry now 💀
12:20 my boy Vikk got set up
I gotta play this someday man istg
13:36 Vik calls Lazarbeam's sister his girlfriend 💀
You new vic wouldn’t do it
Vik never has fun 😂😂😂
2000,th comment lads
I'm from Thailnad. Is it ship to Thailand ?
Tobi a little rizzly bear.😂😂😂😂
Have to do moreeee
She wanted tobi's jizzle
Tobi the rizzler, my guy
Just realised that the set is designed so it’s meant to look like it was filmed in the old Sidemen house. That’s clever if it was intentional, the best coincidence ever if it wasn’t…
How did I not see this video for such a long time
wait where's the replies to the messages is there a sequel?
Tobi we need to know what happened in Dubai
174,000 like 🤨
when tobi got G i was expecting a call
This game is like  the what do you meme game! Tobrizzle had me rolling
Tobi rizard of Oz over here
i can’t find the game…
Tobi got a date
😊
Ethan probably got Tobi a girlfriend
Ethan should have responded “or was it” to the text
Vick is such a puss... hes so boring
This was lowkey such a good idea
How can i make sure i can order this game in the netherlands??
tobi is that guy
09:58 best moment lmao
Need more time for these 😢
Ethan fully sounded like filly when he said "you alright?" 😂
Ethan sounded so much like filly it was scary 😱😱 11:47
Vik folding his legs
can tell sidemen made this game🤣🤣
ha
This is soooo good, i might get this :)
Hugh probably thought that was for faith 😭
Watched an episode of inbetweners once and copy’s there game
Need an update of tobis date? What happened?
Tobi is good looking and nice why r we surprised he got rizz😂
Do people still save contacts and use phone numbers? Everyone in my year use snap and discord to call and text.
omg the picture for Josh's mum hahahaha
I need more of these, they’re so good😂
Toberizzled is very rizzy
@MoreSidemen why r u taking vik tht no contribution....
Please make this the motto “don’t be lame, get laid, buy the game and they’ll remember your name”
I love how Harry is sitting in a mound of cushions 😭
def need a 3rd video of this
Toni’s soo cute 😂😂😂
❤❤❤❤
We cannot guarantee this game secures dubs🤣
You should get ginge and Danny in there 😂
Is kissing cheating is what I wanted too
Can’t lie vikk is so boring
Dangerous game to play icl
Where is the link😩😩😩
Behzingha's Joke at 18:28 is perfect and I keep repeating it
16:57 😂
8:00 😂
7:59 nahhh they did my boi Tobi dirty 🤣🤣
This game was funny af
Yeah make another video of this lmaooo
vik needs to go hes so annoying
Do it againnn mann😂😂😂
THIS ABSALOUTELY CLASS 🤣🤣🤣
:)
Did u ever go to Dubai Tobi??
8:00
Cards against humanity with a twist😂
1:47 only real sidemen fans will remember this reference😂😂
Should have done a forfeit if opt out 😅
Boys, love your work. But the "everyone talking at once then laughing" schtick is grating.
For some reason the way British people say H bothers me
Harry and Josh together are Goats
You have to make shipping to portugal i need this game
Mum ipad
underrated how that guy said his mum & freya were having a discussion about the question😂
Tobijizle Is The Best Sidemen Member Or Should I Say Tobirizzle
Part 2 😂😂😂
Hi
(^) /•.• /.
You should've done a forfeit for the person with fewer points
Am I the only one who thought vik was a little bitch for not texting Lazar
What ran by the window at 18:24?
Tobiiiii
So did Tobi actually go to Dubai?
9:11 tobis little “ahh reply” was so adorable sounded like he was excited for a little date 😅
😹😹😹Wow you made me laugh.
Why does Tobi send the text from a different phone (black colour, that Simon handed to him) rather than his personal phone (the white one) that he looked up the contact on? Looks fishy
I’ve rewatched this video so many times, I need a part 2 with the troops!!!
Tobi’s legs hanging off the couch tho 😂😂😂
up until 2:20 minute i only realized ksi was there 😂
10:00 proud of you Toby! 👀
Part 2
8:00 nah that edit was vile lol
Nah the way ksi fake laughing bro I love it when it's the other 6 and not him
I love how Simon and Ethan are sharing cards the whole time and nobody gives a rip
AYYYY TOBIII 🥶🗣️🔥💪💪💪
Why weee they loud about the e one for vic?
this game is horrible lmao
best vid
This was jokes 😂😂
please do a  longer version
The way JJ said "Habibi" just makes it better
Damn tob rizzle
Gotta do the next video in Dubai so that Tobi has to go on that date 🤣
Loser should have to do something off to make them want to do it more  Laserbeam reaction would of been gold
More of this lads!!
HABIBIIIIII
W ntobi
This is the funniest shit ever, love it
The topics section is pretty cool
Ksi is the best
;)
This looks so fun just chilling with the boys playing games like this
I wish the thumbnail happen
We need part 2
Vik should of gotten a punishment
tobi the rizzard of oz
do a  paart two
I could feel the cringe just imagining being the one the text is chosen for, like I’d want to check my contacts because I have a lot of work stuff lol
Need to do a prank phone call one
ALRIGHT I’ll by it
Behz’s botox looks painful
Josh’s mum hasn’t replied yet 😅
Hahaha brilliant video
nahhhh gotta get a part 2
I loved Harry's little fort of pillows lol
Love love love this video! We need more!
This might be the first video on this channel that I watched all the way through!
This was actually so funny I really hope they do this more
That thumbnail is wilddd
Tobirizzler 😂😂 Off to Dubai then son! Or Habibi
The fat lion was such a clever throwback
need more
As well as phone contacts, they should add Instagram, messenger and snapchat DMs as well.
Joshs mum still hasn’t gotten back to him 😂
For the next time try not with messenger but with tinder but without letters and a number for example 3 is 3 swipes 2 for no and 1 for yes
This was such a good video. I really hope they do many more of these.
Quick suggestion tho, if u opt out of a text u should get a forfeit, like there would be a deck of cards made for forfeits, or maybe another way could be if u opt out u get a harder riskier text to send, cus right no its too easy to just opt out, no one cares about points
Kevin DeBezinga over there 😂😂
19:09 what does harry say under his breath when everyone starts laughing?
This game will destroy families/relationships
10:09 🙇‍♂️
is  that a penguin behind tobi 18:14
Harry's stutter was outrageous💀
Harry is saying "my personal favorite is.. I have always been attracted to you". I see Guernsey dripping all over this.
this could be an hour long sidemen sunday.....
Yep. This is the closest we going to get for another cards against humanity content 😂.
Bro that thumbnail is wild 😂
funny video. terrible game to play though imo, some are gonna learn fast that some dont take well to jokes
We need this in other countries!!! Like Italy for example! :(
this needs a series! lmao
Lol KSI only has a new phone cuz speed leaked his number
this could have been a main vid
Ethan asking harry if he’s threatening him is like asking for death. Harry is the definition of batshit insanity.
you could tell Tobi was a bit gassed when G replied!
WE NEED MORE
Round 2?
Tobi is the driest human on planet earth, bet he messaged ahead and told her they were playing a game first
The one with least points should have an extra text sent
Tobi quick tx sort me a flight to dubai after this vid 😅😂
Good concept but if we don’t see all the replies then what’s the point
14:37 boringgg🙄🙄
Is this not cards against humanity with a twist
Part 2 is needed 😂
The should be part 2,3,4,5 Please
15:39😂😂😂😂
Would love to get it to iceland
MORE OF THIS PLEASERE
Cool 😎
i hope they do a part 2
NEED TO BE A SIDEMEN SUNDAY

0:19
PART 2222
Great video
Vik is a poon 🤣
Bro harrys the ultimate autistic salesman 😂
I KNOW THE creep Ethan is TALKING about
We want a Part 2.
Nah that’s not Tobjizzle that’s TobRizzle
Make the people with 0 points do a forfeit so they could not cop out of sending message.  That would make things much spicier.
So did tobi go to Dubai?
its not available in the Netherlands :(
TOBI😈😈
I think you should have games with real stuff on the line like your yellow and red card counts to increase or decrease depending whether you win or lose, that'll make it more intense and real
*I can't be the only one whos getting sick of all these videos just being massive ads for crap we're not gonna buy?*
rizzler
Vik lost weight... wedded bliss, i see
The HabibI IM CRYINGGGGGG I love u guys 😭😭😭😭I’d love to see them do something with other languages ! Arabic
Seems like it's out of stock on amazon already 😭😭😭
pog
We need a part 2
why are ethan his socks always so gross
is toby going to dubai???
sidemen lethal company when?
welll...? Did toby went on the date?
I'm worried that this will get banned for promoting harassment 😬
this is actually cards against humanity with a twist
This game would be mental with my family 😂
18:26 that cat scared the 💩 out of me
waiting for part 2
Just wanna know if Filly replied
Would make a fun drinking game ;)
i would actually be so pissed if i got asked out for drinks and found it it was all for a game😭
, sounds like a gold digger
0:45 seconds in but let me say this could turn into a drinking game where take a shot or down your drink if you don’t want to send the message. Also if you use this idea I want credit
This was so fun!!!
Tobi set that up, took him 5 mins to send a 6 word text 🤷🏼🤦🏻‍♂️
I wanna know if Tobi went 😂
11:46 so accurate from ethan
Nah, the game sucks for introverts. Sorry guys. Like 10 contacts on my phone
6:14 nah this got me 💀
Toby:D Jahhhjj, replied. :D XDDDDDD
Tobi!😂the ladies man
wanted it to be longer🥲
"Habibi come to Dubai"
0:20 ofc harry goes “oooooo” when he hears line😂
yo 13:51 who laugh was that, none of them laughed hard enough to make that sound LMFAO
Ain’t no way that’s joshes moms profile pic 😂😂😂
Pay for tobi ticket to Dubai and let the man cook guys
Vik actually isnt funny at all
All 7 in the OG house is crazy
love seeing them in the old sidemen house
Need a video to where Tobi goes out with her
We need a part 2
tobi at 4:48 “ submit your cards gentlemen”
tobi is me bye
One more episode
seeing tobi freaking out after sending and getting replies just like every other guy is hilarious plus the lads hyping him up
Awh tobi 😭❤️ get ittt

What’s Tobi gonna have to say to that girl? Say that he’s joking even though she said “my love” Tobi is in a situation
i really hope Tobi flying to smash
idc if this is second channel tobi has to go dubai for that
Should do this again with a mukbang at sametime, get a good hour of replies 😂
This is the main channel content.
These boys need to play send to all 🤣🤣
Why the gone soft for Simon?
Can we see more of this game 😊
This one's screaming a part 2..... Man those 20 mins were hilarious as fuck😂😂..... Btw jj you are my top artist in this year's Spotify wrapped🤟🤟
Reminds me of the inbetweeners Camping trip episode 😅
3 mins in can tell this is a banger like a real life card czaar but with texts 😂😂 iykyk
please also ship the game to India
OG sidemen house
I could never play this game. 😂
Do more of this game
Legend says Josh’s mum still hasn’t replied
Bro this is such a dead game
Wait this is their old sidemen house or am i tripping
Either josh's mom is a legend covering for him or she just does not care and blanked him hahahahah ah
The edit of Tobi being short LMAO
Vikk is literally a role model we can tell. Anyways, PART 2!!!
Ok who put the obese Lion from the fat animals video as Josh's mum lmao
this game seems so fun, but i could never play 😂 i've got like 3 contacts lmao
Sidemen lethal company?
This was incredible
Need to know what happened to zerka 😂
Need a part 2 of this man this was unreal 😅😂
SIDEMEN‼️‼️‼️ Play this game again but if they don’t send the text you gotta take a shot.
I think Freya & mum were planning Josh's murder 😂😂
😂😂
The rizzler strikes again!
De bruynesque through ball fr
I don’t think this would work with me I have 10 contacts
This was legit better than ANY sidemen Sunday they’ve ever done there needs to be a longer main channel vid of this!!!  Also has anyone noticed JJ short circuit blinking more lately?😂 is that from boxing? Dude shld get that checked out
Maybe it's just me but the laughs at 20:47 feels rehearsed lol 😂😂😂😂
https://youtu.be/w0ZY8ZihTQM?si=OItAco8ssr3rYnhp
Yo, this straight up banged. There needs to be atleast 3 rounds in a video in order to catch up to the winner
If Tobi didn’t go to Dubai I’d be disappointed 😅
Free 🇵🇸 Palestine
Part 2 asap😂😂😂
Wonder if they heard sticky Vicky passed away.
Tobi is smooth
If they pick the persons card that person should get a point
NEED A PART 2 this was hilarious
Dear editors stop putting music on these
Another banger
Filly’s reply we demand to see it
I want to see the Sidemen play “The Chameleon” game
This was really good but there should be a big punishment if ya don’t send vik got of too light
Should've made ethan text his dad
Simon and Ethan in the back being the iconic duo and laughing at each others answers is something I never knew I needed 🫶
TOBRIZZLE
Good vid
We need an update for tobi’s Friday night date please 😅
Part 2 pls 🤣🤣
I NEED THIS IN PART 2, 3 AND MORE CUS THIS SHIT WAS HILARIOUS!!
Do part 2 !!!
tobi we need an update
Tobi the box to box rizzler
I love harry no homo🫡
TOBRIZZLE
This video made from Tobjizzle to Tobrizzle LMAO 😂
Harry is the Shill Master 😂😂
So basically, cards against humanity?
This was hilarious we definitely need a part 2 longer episode
I love that for Tobi! I mean Habibi ❤
Yaaaay filly! ❤
Seriously ksi is becoming white
This room reminded me of the og sidemen house
Legend has it the rizzler took a flight to dubai after this video....
This Chanel is way better than the main one.
wtf is this like so booooooring
Turn it into a drinking game! Exactly the same but each text chosen at the end of the round means the person who was picked drinks. Then whichever text is picked is given a drink score out of 10 for how bad it is as voted by the group. That is how many drinks you must have if you chose to not let the text be sent. 🤔  Feel free to argue between yourselves the official rules. I'm just giving you my idea
When can we get sidemen lethal company:)
11:48 Ethan mimicking what Filly would say and how he'd sound is so accurate 💯😂😂😂 for a moment I thought it was an edit of Filly's voice innit.😂
Harry has defo smoked a zoot before this
Tobrizzle 👏👏
Toby needs to do dubai vlog
R1 is finesse shot btw
They need part 2 asap this was mad funny
=DDDD
If Callux and calfreezy had a threesome would it be a californication?
TobiRizzle
Omg, I haven’t laughed so much in a while, play it again and longer. Like 100000 hours.
You are so wonderful and talented ❤
Fun game : I think there was some inspiration from the game what do I meme
Good to see the loser to Tommy fury again
خفن بود
“Yeah habibi” 😌 My guy 👊🏽
Where can you buy these cards?
Please do a part 2 🙏
10:27 Damn Tobi's short. JJ and Tobi seating next to each other... JJ's legs touching the ground and Tobi's are soo high up... 😂😂😂 Tobi's sooo short😂😂
“Anyone could be on the line” *immediately cuts to Harry*
Good luck Tobi
can we just say r.i.p to joshes relation ship
hilarious
The setup looks like the porn meme with the white girl and the black guys all around the sofa
We need more of these this is awsome
We neeeeeeeed a part 2!!!!!!!!
Part 2 now… this was hilarious… and  Tobi actually getting a date is crazy
Tobi is the real Rizzler
10:02 habibi come to dubaiii
Tobi u gotta go now haha
WE NEED MOOOORRRRRRE!!!!
My respect for vik📈
Tobi is the real winner
More more more !!
Tobi 👌
just throwing this out you all need to look into playing Lethal company.
Wtf is spanked grandpa's inheritance? Come on editors...
Love it how fans just accept Tobi as the biggest man whore and its just the norm now.
Do another one
Please do a part 2 of this, this was so funny 😂😂😂😂
So its CAH but just texts..
Lol 😂 more
Parttttt-2 Pleaseeeeeeeeeee....
We need a Tobi vlog in Dubai
Ksi I have 27 prime bottles even the glowberry two of them
Better content than sidemen Sundays
OH BROTHER THIS IS CONTENT
TobRizzle
Josh "What's Lannon's sister's name?" Vik "No, no, that's his girlfriend"
Tobrizzle
Legend has it that Josh's mother still hasn't replied
harry is on business. mans is right away on ohhh what a good quality cards this is. i would say the best in the game 🤣🤣🤣 he on money
try not to sell us something every week challenge imposible
I feel like they can only play this game once though. Just like with Harry at the start, everyone will just assume they’re playing the game unless they like take numbers from each other’s phones, like Josh texts a number from Ethan’s contact list.
This is a phenomenal video 😂. We definitely need a part 2
Harry promoting the game the whole time is hilarious
Best ad ever.
I need a part two
Another cash grab 😂
all the gasps at 17:59 was so funny😭😭
Nah the pfps were MAD
Harry should have picked the porn site one that would have been hilarious.
6:34 new Instagram transition vid, Simon claps and Harry's hoodie goes away 😂
This video ends on 21 21 savage mode. 😮
The disclaimer after Tobi’s round has me crying 🤣🤣😭😭
vik should have sent the text. that would have been jokes
14:25 who are the talking about?
" i traveled to dubai for this ...." new video for Tobi
Tobi will have a girl on an NDA to make sure Jesus doesn’t find out
THIS WAS TOO GOOD LMFAOOO
Gotta do a Phonecall one next 😂😂😂
We gotta get a 1 hour long video of this
day 1 of asking for yall to play Ultimate Chicken Horse its fun
YEAH HABIBI
The Rizmaster 3000 strikes again
It’s so confusing who was the host Simon or vol😭😭🤣
So  Cards against humanity but better.  Literally what the sidemen grew up on!!!
One of my personal fav moresidemen vids from now on 😂😂
Sucks vikk didn’t send anything
You guys should make a longer video of this game, and add a forfeit element like: anyone who opts out needs to take a double shot, the person with the most points after a single round can nominate one person to take a shot
Tobi, the winner of the game, and he's the real winner.
TOB-RIZZLE!!!!
Tobi rizzle
I would happily lose this game every time 😂!
Are they in the first sidemen house?
Sidemen can't swear but Lil nas X can post naked men worshipping the devil
i miss sidemen cards agaist humanity
this is real good
PLEASE PLAY MORE OF THIS
Tobrizzle 😤
Harry sold that msg with his selfie ngl😂
he isn’t Tobjizzle he’s Tobrizzle
Just stirring shit for no reason is like the Most unneccesary thing in the world and the reason, a Game, is like we're Back in puberty. Bad game and Just trying to make more Money from us
This would make a great Sidemen main video
9:13 was so cute omf, the way they all acted like girls in highschool 😂😂
this has the potential to be such a good Christmas/boxing day game
Josh still waiting on his mum replying 😂
u guys should colour your videos, it would be more vibrant (ps its just a suggetion)
it doesn’t ship to the US yet😢
18:13 birb be vibing in the background
What happened with Josh text. I wanted to see what his mom reply😐
Why does Harry pronounce H and Heich?
I think the points should go to whoever’s card gets picked, CAH style
only issue with this video is its to short i need a full 8 hour video of this
16:50
Uau...I want my time back
Please do shipping to south Africa
is Tobi actually going to Dubai?
the trivella pass from ethan went crazy😭😭
Need a part 2 of this. Best Moresidemen video of the year. So hilarious
SUCH A GOOD VID, SURELY ROUND TWO!
Tobe-rizzle strikes again
WE NEED MORE OF THIS!
what did harry say at 19:13?
Harry: tell you what boys what a fun game this is OUT IN STORE.
To make the game more enjoyable there needs to be a Punishment for people who Pussie out of the Prank
17:27 17:57 😂 simons face 18:27
Finally a good sidemen video after a long time ❤
PART 2 PLEASE 😂🎉😂
me :going to gym and tries to get veins in my bicep  vik: sigma has veins in his neck
This was the most fun I’ve had in a moresidemen video ngl.
Vic is a good friend for not sending the text
Tobi's nervous squeals when she replied had me wheezing
More of this‼️‼️
more of this🤣
please make a game where its 3 groups of 2 each group. the game is very basic but will be very funny. each person can only say 1 word and the other person has to continue the sentence by saying another 1 word and it goes back and fourth. sometimes you end up getting some mental stories when the 2 keep going back and fourth hahah
do it again
this is like cards of humanity on crack
Bro this video should have been on the main channel
TOB-RIZZLE 😂
Hope a for sure part 2, I def planning on doing this with my friends
Tobi got rizz
These are 30 years guys going “ sry my mates made me text that” 😂
more of these plz
This was actually jokes
Yo
it was so wholesome how the boys were telling what to say for tobi
Do you guys think they actually sent the texts ?
Pls do this again😂😂😂😂
Best moresidemen yet 😂
This game is so funny, need to see a round two closer to Christmas ✌️😅
it's giving cards against humanity haha
This was a great video!
This is so cool part 2 3 4 5 6 7 nowwwww
This was utterly hilarious! 😂😂😂 they need to do a part 2!
Vik could have won this, it’s easily defensible; especially if you’ve known him for a while.
Did Tobi meet her?
Who told these gentlemen, this is a good idea. This game will ruin many peoples lives because people don’t know how to just play games.
Tobi is really humble and nice in person. Dubai will always be Open for you.
avaliable Christmas in USA😂 🖕🏽
This vid has to be on the main channel, I can watch this for hours
What reply josh got ?
Tobi jizzle? More like Tobi Rizzle
We need part 2
This is THE most dangerous, friendly fire, version of Cards Against Humanity 😂
Nahh the thumbnail is mad 💀
Make this a series where points add up over the whole series and the replies will be counted in the next episode.
That was mad 🤣🤣
losers gonna have some forfeits, it might be even more fun
TOBI THE RIZZLAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
PART 2 NEEDED
That girl Tobi texted is gunna be devastated when she sees this video 😂😂😂
I could never play this, but it's fun to watch
TOBIIII I KNOW U HAVE IT IN U 😂😭
Imagine Tobi just found his wife through that
We need a Sidemen Sunday of this game
PART TWO PLEASEE BRO
Its like card against humanity with a twist
i aint got enough contacts to get this game
I have a theory that Harry isnt gonna be liked much in a year and that people will find him annoying. just a feeling lol
we need part 2 this shit is helerius
we need part 2
we need part 2 and the loser has to do a forfeit
Sidemen were actually enjoying so much here this is my new favorite video please more of these !
9:52 MA NIGGA TOBI YANOE
The thumbnail 💀
i can't believe a pack of cards costs 25 pounds
We NEED 2nd part.😂😂
Tobi the rizz master,  take me in as your student tobi sensei
Wtf is that thumbnail😭
Part 2 plzzz we need a series of this as well
The way the picture from the fattest animals was edited as the contact pic for Josh’s mum hahahha
i think we need a pt 2 & longer vid of this
This reminds me so much of Cards Against Humanity
Hackney can't be his 3rd contact though. Who would even go before that.
Yeah habibi she wants tobi’s dee dee 👀🤣🤣
Behzinga wear his signature t-shirt always😂
Lazar was also vikk's best man at the wedding so.....understandable for him to not lose his loyalty and respect for lazar
TBRZL FOR SURE!!
Tobi’s first one gets a reply in six seconds?! That’s probably the quickest reply to a text I’ve ever seen
Did no one catch the tobi edit when jj said "am i short"
Tobi’s face at 7:59 after the “Am I short?” card 😂
Really hope they do this again, great concept
When the sponsor is good
Haha the disclaimer did me in!! Hahha
10:26 or that 😅
Tobrizzle flew straight to Dubai that Friday 😂
Just out of curiosity, couldn't this game be played with pen and paper? Why should someone purchase the game?
Looks like a fun game but it requires friends 🙂
WE NEED A PART TWO ASAP!!
What has happened to Ethan’s eyes? No hate, I’m just a little worried.
Would love to see more of this game don’t think I laughed so hard in my life 😂
The Rizz god has arrived
Have ordered for Christmas. I can't wait to play this one with the family 😂😂
Bro I love Simon with these one liners! Just jokes ❤😂
It only works if you have bare contacts I only have close family and 3 close friends 😭
Corner take quickly… Habibi
WE NEED PT2
We need the contacts on all of Toby's phones _😂_
harry really is the funniest
Stolen from the inbetweeners
This is more fun than the monopoly game in the main channel 🤣
Tobi is THE best box to box
"I can be 👀" 🤣😭😭
"I can be 👀" from Tobi.. didn't know he had that uch rizz
This game is mad
P2
i feel like watching normies realizing that drinking is not the only way to have fun
I am BEGGING YOU TO PLAY MORE
we need more of these, I reckon every 5th vid. Need more time to study Tobi's rizz
I hope the sidemen make a great Christmas song next month
Tobi is so good at rapping
I would have loved multiple rounds of this.
W vik
Tobjizzler the Rizzler
Habibiiiiiii

did anyone know that habib means love
Best game hilarious 😂
This is siiick  We need another one of this XD
This was hella fun to watch 😂
Toby to his children in future "that's how I met ur mother" 9:46
Somewhere in Du-Bai you might find To-BI🗿
Need a series of this. This is 😂
Ksi get off the internet you sell out
Yeah habibi , tobis coldest moment 🎉
ima need a part 2
Tobi at 8:00 💀
COOL VIDEO!! THANK YOU SIDEMEN 🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂

Loved the video😊
British accent  it's  like packet drop in the network 😂😂 I can't understand shit what they are saying bow o wo
Part2 ??
YEAH. HABIBI 👁️👄👁️
Do a longer Video of this game . Do a main channel vidoe of this game
When the boys just have fun🥰🥰🥰🥰
8:00 they did tobi dirty with this one 🤣🤣🤣
❤
TOBRIZZLE ✨😂
WE NEED PART 2 THIS IS SO FUNNY 🤣
Saudis in audis,tobi in dubai
Tbrzl 😂❤
Tbrzl 😂❤
need more if this. one of the best card games to be put out
TobRizzle on fire 😂😂
For the next time, the person who doesn't text, has to down a drink as a punishment.
Definitely do another part of this, this was amazing 😂 Well done boys!
You should make this into an app to download as a game
Should’ve done like 3 rounds of this lol
Great game guys 😂
This game goes crazy😂
this game would be fun if i had more than like 9 people in my contacts
We need another sidemen distract like the Christmas drilling this Christmas 🎄⛄ ❤️
The level of rizz on show from Tobit was mad. Man said I can be.
Do these guys not know how to wash a fucking floor or something every single video they post and they don’t have shoes on their socks might as well have been walking through a mud pit. Seriously how hard is it to clean a floor? Y’all are making millions and your white socks still look like you’ve wiped your ass with em.
10:04 epic... this is the best video... Tobi habibi
10:03 😂 🫡 FairPlay Tobi
We need a part 2 video was a banger
6:06 😂😂😂😂
My question is,,,, did Tobi go to Dubai?👀
Harry promoting is top notch 😂😂
Bro y’all are rich enough. Why are you putting an ad within the first 90 seconds of the fucking video? That’s one way to loose viewers.
this could make the best main channel vid, loved it
more sidemen has recently been dropping bangers. i’d argue a lot of the times the more sidemen vids are better than the main channel ones 👀. sleeper build for sure haha
Harry got excited when vik said lines
Part 2 hurry up
Tob Rizzle
Vikk really didn't broke the brocode
Tobi with the rizz 🔥🔥🔥
This game gonna bang
NEED MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS, PLS PLAY MORE
It wouldve been jokes if ethan replied to the shower one worh Oh, sorry. Wrong brother😂😂
There should be more videos of this game😂
I want this game I’m in USA☠️
This might be THE BEST & FUNNIEST games the boys have played/created ? Talk about a banger of an idea. 11/10
This was too much fun!! Definitely have to do more of this game 😂
Banger!
Tobi is just a man of the ladies
Diss tracks may come hahaah
Vik is an absolute giga chad. Declines disrespecting boys sisters
how long did they stay at this house to record but I love the house vibe
Meh, kinda boring. Besides it wouldn't work with most people, 90 percent of us would know if it's a real text or not considering we all have our own individual styles of texting and talking. Plus the language barrier would kill the game dead, half of these don't translate well/naturally in other languages.
Only people who didn't come from tiktok are allowed to like this comment!
WE NEED A PART 2!!!!
This was jokes please do this again 😂😂😂😂
Tobi better be in Dubai by Friday
PART TWOOOO
gooooooood video
Harry wasnt backing the sister one, he knows how it feels loool
Thiswas hilarious
18:23 what was that in the window?
Sadly Viks reputation good keep him looking like a really good guy but that’s how he gets the brand deals and what not respect
“Yea habibi” man Tobi’s in there fr 😂😂
Where's gta boys
Hey everybody

yo simon should have had ethan text mia malkova
Nah they should do this for Twitter or Instagram that'd be jokes 🤣
Amazing video and game🔥 You should do more videos on this and tally up all the points!!!
This was actually fun
banger🔥
sticking out your gyatt for the rizzler❤❤
why is this soo short
If tobi end ups marrying this gyal its all because of Behzinga. 😂
Moreeeeeeeee this game
When's part 2 ? This was hilarious 😂
What’s the E 1 on vik? who is it?
sidemen will farm views now... finally an original good idea
GIVE US PART 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The rhino as Josh’s mums contact picture is madddd🤣🤣
Was this in San Diego by any chance?!
the am i short edit on tobi was so funny i died😂😂
this is golden we need more of this. get the troops involved
now we wait for $100 vs $100,000 holiday where the good team goes to Dubai
Toby is too cute.

This game is impossible if you have no friends 😂😂
That is a video idea , tobi's date in Dubai
HEYCH💀💀 “h”
TOBI HAS TO MEET WITH THE GIRL. Ayo Tobi get your rizz on. And this look like a awesome game.

11:23 ksi the man using a bum ass iphone 13 💀💀
Noo I wanted to see filly’s reply
This is so wholesome
loved this video! even if you guys don't play it for youtube content much. would be awesome on Side+
Big tobrizzle
Okay... im all for a part 2 for this. Its like a 2023 version of cards against humanity and im all for it.
harry a real businessman
I reckon if your card gets picked you get a point also
Me and the boys when texting crush😂😂😂 9:30
I would love to see this be a monthly game on MoreSidemen because I thought this was quite hilarious.
that would be a good video for the tbjzl channel. also good promotion for the game. "going on a date in DUBAI"
Tobi got the Hattrick thanks Ethan’s assist 😂😂
Knows her dad but has her number. Okay Tobi
Need more videos of this it was absolute jokes
Yes Zosh, it is cheating :) Especially when you are already in a relation or love someone.
This felt so much like the Cards Against Humanity days and I love it
This can have a part 2
We need more, that was hilarious 😂
tobi mr rizzler
Tbrzl
19:36 is the most fake ksi laugh I’ve heard.
Harry plugging and advertising anything is always hilarious, its so obvious
Great video love the content Def want the game
Tobibi FTW bruh
Part 2 is a must
W ad L product tbh
Fantastic energy to kick it off boys, well done
boo no one cares play among us
Let's gooo
More pls
So this game is like cards against humanity put texting someone
so this is basically cards against humanity but you text it to someone
The people need a part 2 ASAP!!! This was absolute gold. Such a hilarious game 😂
should make it for steam/consoles
Common Vik W
more!
More of THIS please
Josh getting aired by his mum is jokes 🤣
deffo need a part 2
i will be buying this game cause of this video, they gotta make a second vid
I wanted to see filly’s reaction
Now I know where that Tobi clip was from 😂
video time... 21 21
Christmas is coming up, someone get ethan new socks 🤣
Such a blahh game
Nah the thumbnail is wildin
They should make this into an app
Should’ve made Ethan text Elz 👀
Need more
9:10 16:56 18:58
This was JOKES. Would actually purchase this game.
H = Haych 🥲
Tobi 20 vs 1 make it happen
Tanner and lux is outrageous 😭
We need more, please
I realllllyy enjoyed this video, should defo redo this again, proper good one
Who the fuck is tanner?
Tobi is Him 😂😂😂
I know this video was just to promote their game but it’s probably one of their best moresidemens in a while😂
Why does jj have the smallest phone and he makes the most money
TOBI THE RIZZLER
16:46 “Getting in the shower…;)” 😂😂
Tobi’s him
A New rule should be added: The one with the least points has to send a text written and chosen by the others
Tobrizzl at it again
can you do a video on lethal company but full video like the entirity un-cut
should have been whoever card it is he gets a point as well.
Duuuude we need a long video of this  Amazing content 😂😂😂
The thumbnail is maaaad🤣
Lets be real. Tobi is the real winner here. He won the game and got a date. And then stood her up😂 W RIZZ
Who is the girl that Tobi messaged
I really wanted to know what KSI had as a reply to his message
we need more of this!!!
I just opened the new sidemen cards and did not get my garenteed autograph card. I paid 100p and got scammed. I can’t believe it!
This was one of the most elite moresidemen concepts
a bit like the inbetweeners in the final season and last episode??
Watching tobbii blush is literally so wholesome
What a great idea for a game! I get really anxious when it comes to texting so I don't think I would send any of these messages out to my friends and family.
PART 2 WITHIN 2 MINUTES PLEASE !! 🤣
Keep the score for the next times you play this game. That way it isn’t just one round
9:52 oii i didn't know boys have such reaction as well 😂
I hope Tobi 20 v 1 is in the works
Defo need to do this again but a longer vid a couple of rounds each this vid was class 🤣🤣🤣
You should’ve done this as a sidemen Sunday! It wouldn’t work now because people receiving the texts off you would know you’re more than likely playing the game now as you’ve already uploaded this video… a long version of this on a Sunday would’ve got you ££££££!
this was so good, please do a part 2
Tobi makes it look so easy
I could've watched an hour of that 🤣
do a part 2. 3, 4, 5, etc etc!!
red flag 🚩 “are u in dubai”
Why do a video like this and then not even do the good ones? No point in playing a game like this if you gotta say no we can’t do that one 🤦🏻‍♂️
We need more of this please
certified moresidemen banger
Rizzjzle
Halarius
18:24 magpie.
I love mangos
I have nothing against vik at all but i feel like opting out just ruins the point of the game
WE NEED A PART 2 NOWWWW!
This game seems so fun to play definitely buying this
Tobi definitely texted her and said go along It's a video before texting what he had to text. Get exposed Tobi 😅
MORE MORE MORE
Please do a PART 2!!!!! Hilarious video fr 😂😂
Tobiiiii. Free Content. Go do the trip and see her in Dubai. vlog like callux did with the 20v1 girl
RIZZ master tobi🤣🤣🤣
Finally a good idea! 😂😂
What else can I say, but PART 2 PLEASE!!
Next time there should be a forfeit for the person with the least points so that the are less inclined to not send a text
I don’t have enough contacts in my phone to play this game 💀
Toberizzle
TOBRIZZLE
This is unironically a really good card game
Bro i wanna be like tobi 😅❤
Pls do a part 2
this is the safe version of cards against humanity 😂
Can't wait for the Sidemen Dubai video coming soon ahaha
Aww they should have done another round, this was fun to watch!
TobiRizzle was too smooth
Absolutely nobody is buying this game 💀 beyond dangerous 😂
its been 4 months and josh is still waiting for a reply back
We need to see Josh's mums reaction
Petition for more of this on moresidemen! Leave a like on this comment so sidemen see this!
Filly would’ve been like * profusely laughing* “Broo, That’s mental “
18:13 there's a magpie outside, behind Tobi🤣🥰
pls pt 2
9:53 can’t believe they’ve secured a girl for tobi
Bs on Tobi.. 6:44 his phone out his pocket was white, 8:36.. Simon passes a random black phone for Tobi to text from....?
Tobi switched phones. Bait
I'm expecting to see tobi update on friday that he is on Dubai
This could’ve been a main channel video with some forfeits
🔥
Really want more of these but understand you can’t do them any time soon sick vid
Tobibi
I'm too old for this type of video 😅
Yo Tobi… you dropped this bruv 👑
Why’s it look like Tobis legs aren’t attached to him💀
This reminds a bit of the Cards Against Humanity days, great to remember those days
We definitely need a part 2
"Coming Soon🇺🇸" 😭 I was ready to send it fr
Oh yeah this is becoming a classic
more rounds plz
Part 2 asap this is hilarious 😂😂
Bring Skits back
25 quid?????! Scam merchants
Get yo ass in Dubai Tobi.
Tobi really is handsome af lol he's an international playboy, where the columbians at??
This takes me back to cards against humanity days
Tobi better be on his way to Dubai
Love the game...it's really fun...part 2😅
“Yeah Habibi”😂😂 best part of the video
Is kissing cheating was the obvious best choice for the first one, considering his mom was with freya at the time lmao
Ain’t filly #philly
Tobi isn't beating the allegations anytime soon.
this is crazy, would love to see more
tobi is the man!
Part 2 longer vid time please
Tobi is tooooo adorable 😂❤
Sure inbetweeners came up with this concept
PART 2!!!!
We need more of this😂❤
Pretty much just off the inbetweeners
Still can’t figure out if the set is there old house
Part 2!!!!! Please
I dont know how it hasn't been said so far but Tobi 100000% texted Gemma Owen. JJ matched her on tinder. Tobi knows her dad because football. She was in Dubai a few weeks ago lmao
them giggling about tobi texting that girl was like when your friend dares you to text your crush at a sleepover
I never comment but we NEED A PART 2!!!
I'm assuming we create our own forfeits? this would be a great drinking game.🤣😭😭😭
Thumbnail is wild💀💀
This should be the new guest series. Pit 2 people against each other and the sidemen vote on the text sent each round
Why does nobody call him TobyRizzle?
funniest vid in a while
It's the UK and it's the sidemen, I'm surprised they didn't make it mandatory to send the text lmao
We need a part 2!!!
Why’s that disclaimer so funny 10:25
Do a full sidemen Sunday vid of this with harsh forfeits if you don’t send it
I try it, but it doesn't work in Serbia 😢
gulp
Shut up. Upload more among us
You all should get in the Christmas song all 7 of you should enjoy it if you make would be nice to see all of you on the Christmas track.
this was so hilarious! u should do a part 2
Basically Card against humanity but sending the winner card to your mum. We're here for it 😅
Need part 2, Habibi
For Ethan’s round I would have definitely picked someone like Elz the witch or Lauren Alexis lol
ill buy it if its going to the be avaible in the US
Them pretending what Lucy would reply back just shows how lovely she is.
Them all giggling at tobi texting G is hilarious. Like proper teenager girls (ina good way) 🤣🤣
Tobi his contact list is at least 5GB of data
Yeah HABIBI!!!!! 😂😂😂😂
WE NEED MORE OF THIS GAME!
The way JJ says habibi at 10:00 😂😂😂
There needs to be a “dealers choice” card or something like that where the DM don can compose the message entirely. Big issue is that could end up being to wild
Fun fact, their manager is one of the owners of the card game 👍🏽
“We created our own game” we’ve all watched the inbetweeners
THE GIRL TOBI MESSAGED IS CALLED AIMEE GREEN
Who would have been e 1 they were all thinking for vik??
Tobrizzle
This would be a great game to play if I had more than 10 contacts in my phone lmao
Goated game
You guys should add a punishment card or forfeit card for the person who loses, then that’ll convince people to send the text more often since they don’t wanna be the loser.
MORE MORE MORE
Thumbnail is nuts right now
Bruvv. That thumbnail is madder than
So this is cards of humanity text ver😅
Please play this more this is amazing
Ι replayed it a million times. What did Zerkaa say about his mother and Freya at 2:00?
Tooobbbbiiiiiii 😂😂😂😂😂
Should have asked filly if chunkz is two faced 😭
Tobi habibi😂
this was too funny I hope they do this again sometime 😂😂 might have to buy this game coz it seems like a good one
If we dont See tobi for some Time we know where he went
14:35 First one to do it 0:40 1:00 3:42
Imagine playing this, but not recording a video as evidence 💀
Paaaaart 2 😂😂😂😂😂asap
I wanna hear Filly’s reply 🤣
Yeah Habibi
So we're never gonna know if kissing is cheating
tobi on the first plane to Dubai
Hilarious!
I hope this gets a part 2: drunk edition 😂
🔥🔥
Need this as a series on the channel ASAP absolutely hilarious
You should do this for a Sidemen sunday with a few others be sick
Bold of you guys to make this game assuming I have a lot of friends and contacts in my phone
W game lol
9:58 it’s so funny grown men and they’re acting like teens texting their crushes 😂😂😂
Mooooorrreeee
Part 2?!?!!?!!!?!
I'm gonna need this to be a weekly occurrence 😂
tobi getting ksi sloppy seconds?
Doing jackbox games in a group like this would been so much funnier
what’s habibi
So they filmed this November 8th based on Filly’s tweets…the backlog of videos must be even more insane than previously thought
Waaaaait Tobi has to pull up tho, he can't just leave her hanging like that
Can we make this a full sideman video!
If only I had friends to play with.......
10:00 my goat 12:25 YEAAAAA better be Ellie 😂 19:11 lmao

MORE MORE MORE MORE

Vik is a buster
vik a real one
ngl you can just try rizz up any girl and if she says no you can just tell her you played this game😂
Glad this is their own game cause hopefully that means we get a part two
joshs mums photo😂😂 iykyk
This was better than majority of recent Sidemen Sundays
Cards against humanity but there can be real life consequences. Honestly a goated idea
Nah part 2 is needed 😂 im 30 and this had me creasinggggg this the type of stuff me and my pals would do 😂
Nah seeing Tobi's game live was unreal
We needa part two soon

PART 2 plssss
Needed at least 2 rounds :(
Did Tobi dirty with the short edit 😂
Do a part 2
Sick game! 😂 I could never send the majority of these texts to my contacts though!
We need mire among us
This is basically that scene off the inbetweeners lol
Tobi the person who doesn't drink tells u "Me, you and Drinks, Friday-night"
Lannan would say Viks stupid for not doing it lmao
This reminds me of Card Against Humanity 😂
can we get a delivery to europe plz?
We need another video of this with guests!!
nah this needs a part 2 lmfao😭😭💀
Harry is such a awkward little guy, love him ! Wearing Christmas PJ bottoms too <3 This game looks good thoughs for sure !
You guys should make this game into an app or make it available in other countries 😭 we all want to play it
There needs to be a Part 2, or make it a series
Tobijizzle<Tobirizzle
The last 3-4 moresidemen are close to mid honestly
Ethan repping og merch ❤
We need another video of this game 😂
Love the fact the l sidemen house in this video
Do it again but put stakes on it
This game is pure DANGER
This is like text against humanity
Vik could've just told JJ to read out Ethan's backdoor card in the ASMR voice and got 2 for 1.
Tobi a ladies man 100%
We want part 2!!!!!!!!!!
Do a part two.
Tobi is my idol 😂
TobRizzle

This is like a more dangerous cards against humanity😂
TobiRizzle
Part 2
reminds me of old school cards against humanity. miss it a lot
yeah habibi 😂❤
Has Simon got a mullet?
Hopefully they pre recoreded a few of these. If not then its gonna be difficult for them to do another one of these. It was so good too.
At first I thought this was going to be a horrible game  Then after watching it I know it’s a horrible game that I want nothing more than to never play or consider
I really hope Tobi goes to Dubai. Even if its not a romantic night out, it would be nice if he kept his word.
Part 2 nowwwww
We need more this was so funny 🤣
Tobi looks really good in this vid 👀
Tobi got rizz... he got habbibi replay..take your chance brotha
NEEEEEED THIS GAME
we need a tobi date vlog in dubai

Noooo, I thought the video was longer and was waiting for the second round
That’s tobibi 😂
Part 2 please, this was funny af. Feels like Cards against Humanity almost haha
the background and set up is much better now
:>
Out of curiosity does someone in the group own the first sidemen house?
If only I had enough contacts lol
Keep this one coming boys 😅👏
Simon again being the best😂
Anyone else get distracted by the magpie ahahah
Tobi better go to Dubai
when Hugh replied why did nobody get Ethan to send another txt asking if he could forward it to faith
Nah mate this video was so freaking funny
This is the best game. Please do more
Cards against humanity vibes fo sureee!
Another one
I need a part 2 ASAP!!!!!
he is called the rizzler for a reasssonnnn
This was jokes, need another one of these 😅
Feel bad for the girl Tobi texted :(
this game gives of some serious cards against humanity vibes but this is seems way more funny 😅
7:55 editing team did Tobi dirty
I dont like how the sofa is a u shape it should be a L shape
Looks like they’re in the old sidemen house, the windows look familiar
Alot of Sidemen x KSI collabs lately huh? Im in for it

Roses are red Violets are blue I don't know how to ask But I want a Part 2

Fun to watch - 13:24 did Behz diiiirty lmao

Great Game.
WE NEED A PART 2😂😂😂😂
so they made a cards v humanity but prank text form
Its like cards agenst humanity but instead of cards its texts  L.O.V.E I.T🙆🏻
You guys should make merchandise for South Africa bcz damn we have to pay a lot for your guys stuff😭
Seen the title and i can already tell this vids going to be a banger
i dont have that many friends..
Would happily watch more rounds of this, do more!
that thumbnail is crazy
Tobi is going to Dubai
We need another video of this
Yeaaah Tobi! Get in!!
Lucy sounds like such a gem of a human
I think sidemen go overboard in main channel videos. I think videos like this are really enjoyable to watch
So it’s just a Walmart version of cards against humanity
Gemma Owen 100% for tobi
So fake
need to know josh’s mums reply 😭🤣
We need a pt 2
14:36 W vik✅ 14:46 That disappointment from harry😂😂
This might be the most dislikes video ever.. Hit like to make them know how much dislikes they got.. We hate boring videos..
I liked my own comment.
Tobi, teach us sensei
Goated
I’m totally getting this game when it goes to the states
harry trying so hard to advertise is so funny
Can we make this a regular moresidmen video please this is actual jokes 🤣
Devious card game … i love it
Any game which asks you to send actual texts or post on social media is so lame. You'd struggle to find a group of people willing to do that, and for good reason. Very little payoff for real annoyance. Sorry, but this is shit.
need a part 2
Take a shot everytime they say "Yeah"😂  And you'll die..
vik is always such a coward
9:59 idky the way JJ read it out killed me😭😭😭
Game for ten yr olds 😂
This is so good and funny
Id watch a main channel video of this i stg🤣
How is Tobi getting to Dubai
this was actually funny 😂
That Josh's mum pic😂😂😂 Sidemen editors are goated
Josh laughing at his own jokes whilst everyone else was silent was such an ick 12:00
Tobi😂😂😂
Tobjizzle?   More like   Tobrizzle!!!
Copped
tobi is mr sloppy seconds
hi
hi
This was a fun 21 minute long ad.
I’m is such a Pussio, like Jesus   His wife is 100% with him for the money I’m generally against divorces, but I hope she gets a nice payout for putting up with his Neek 💩
I wanted to see filliys response soo bad😂
Habibi 😂❤
I wanna know fillys reply to JJs message so bad🤣
Part 2 plzzz ngl as tobi is my fav sidemen i laughed 😂 so much brooo hass rizzzzzleee
Crazy how there's a girl out there who knew both JJ and Tobi personally and didn't tell either of them
I might be reaching!!! But Tobi said he knows her father(Pep Guardiola) and his Daughter(Maria Guardiola) lives in Dubai.
The old sidemen house brings tears to my eyes
I better see a part 2 or I riot! But damn, that shit was funny. Wish Vik hadn't chickened out. Also of course Tobi picked up a date out of that. 🩷🩷🩷🔥🔥🔥
we need more of this 😂😂😂 brilliant
vikk should if sent Lazar the message would of been so good lmao
part 2 ASAP !
I need more of these!!!
they will sell anything
we didn't even get fillys reply
more pleaseeeeeeeeee
Wow great game guys!
Callux and Tana? Like mongeau
Buying this game 💯
The new Cards against humanity love it 😍
W game
The card that gets chosen the person who’s card it was should get a point for the best answer
Surely them panning on to Harry when vik says on the line is for a reason come on 😂😂😂
This game is so funny
Simon's imitation of Filly is just the best! That brutha hit spot on.
FOR SURE ONE OF THE BEST VIDEOS PLEASE DO IT AGAIN LMAO
We need this more often 😂
This video is jokes
content!!!! <3
Sad this game won't be in my country because it's small.😅 Would be fun tho.
try not to shill challenge
Amazing video
Couldn't think of a game illd personally want to play less 😂
I need some more of this!  Was so funny
We need a longer video of this!!!! Brings back cards against humanity vibes!!!!❤
Viks a complete melt.
Downloaded the game, now where to download friends 😢
Who else checked their contacts during this video?
Didn’t they just buy this from someone else
This should be a 2hr long sidemen Sunday, I would watch no questions.
We need an update on Tobi's date
This reminds me of cards against humanity 😂😂
It's a fun idea but this feels way too personal to be a successful game idea?
the clickbait got me
As an introvert this is hilarious to watch but I don't want anyone in my vicinity to know about this.
This is like Cards Against Humanity but has repercussions in your personal life. Looks like a good time 😂
They are so good at making their own games… this was so good! I wish the vid was longer. Please more rounds next time! 👍🏻
You need to do part 2
Nah the way harry mixed up L1 & R1 killed me 😂 the guy chipped it
We need a part 2 of this was insanely funny 😂
I think  the sidemen   should  be  more  of  this game
It's not natural anymore...too made up. Fake. Used to be good. Still the odd good videos.
This was the best! Had me dying! 😂
Fun vid but the game is kinda ass ngl
why did Tobi switch phones?
We need more 😂
I need this game😂😂
TBJZL the rizzler but we already knew lmao.
Part 2 please
Great video had me dying the whole time we def need part 2 asap
21 mins is not long enough for this☹️😂
Now lets have the boys play Lethal Company
We need an update on Filly's reply lmao
This is like cards against humanity
Gotta add forefits for those who opt out.
Bruh we need a hour plus of this 😂😂😂
damn, it's fun, we need another video!!
I want this game 🤣
TOBI GOT DAT RIZZZZZ
Yo I got a more sidemen idea sidemen drunk quiet game where they start off drunk and play quiet game
Tobi's Dubai rizz is probably the best marketing for this product they could ever ask for 😂😂
Dead game.
What a great vid lads! Love these types of videos. Old school vibes.
The app doesn’t exist lol but good video funny af
Can we PLEASEEEE get a Tobi 20 v 1 !?
I better see a part 2 or I riot! But damn, that shit was funny. Wish Vik hadn't chickened out. Also of course Tobi picked up a date out of that.
Part 2 this is jokes man 🤣
These videos are getting worse. Lazy.. same venue just throwing out videos for the sake of it... even the clips are click bait. Tut tut
This was a good video !!!
I need updates! Did Lucy murder someone? How was Tobjizzles date? Is Joshes mom okay?
this was so funny😭✨
Nahhhh 💀😭 the editors did tobi dirty 8:00
So irl cards against humanity if I'm understanding the game right.
Book a ticket to him
need a part 2 asap
Sidemen should make a big game like they play board games but playing Twister or spin the bottle with Truth or dare rules like Monopoly.
The thumbnail 💀💀💀
Yeah this should be a series 😂
Hilarious video do another
This one was hilarious we need more for sure
This was sick
“We’ve 					done it” 😂
Tobi 20v1 pls
20:47 - Harry wearing tinsel scarf? Sidemen Christmas Mukbang at old Sidemen house?
12:30
Anyone see tobi’s phone change colour before he sent that text?
Banger video
another cash grab
Great game idea, just only will work for certain people. I have about 10 total contacts in my phone 😭
To be fair Lannan will be disappointed Vik didn’t send it
I was hoping for a round 2
What if this video is a cover up because Josh asked his mum is kissing cheating and then Freya accidentally saw it?
We would love more part of this game❤
WE NEED A PART 2 🔥
Lesssss goooooo
I love Simon and Ethan in the corner laughing at each others answers lol
This is Cards Against Humanity vibes, love it
Nah her replying "Habibi" is Crazy 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Tobi is the RizzGod😂😂
PART 2
To improve your game, whoever's text gets picked also gets a point
I never knew men acted exactly like highschool girls do when getting a text back. That's adorable.
Need a part 2 ASAP with guests if possible
20 vs 1 TOBI is must NOW. 😂
Again! Again! Again!
omg just ralisesd Joshes mum's "profile pic" is from reacts lmao
JJ's the best wingman and hype man
whos here from that youtube short??😂
No way KSI is in the vid
Tobirizzle 😂😂😂
omg we need a part 2
TOBBIIIIIIIIIII
DAMN Part two when?!
This was such a fun video, please do a part 2 in the future maybe get others involved too lol also go Tobi 😂
Can u make a game u dont need friends to play
This game is going to cause murders. Some of these cards are diabolical.
is this an actual game or they just created it? sidemen never disappoints in content
Should of done atleast 2 questions each
Tobrizzel 🎉
Insane thumbnail
0:19 vik: anyone could be on the line Camera cuts to Harry saying oooh haha 😂 kid loves his lines haha 😂
You do know you have to do a part 2 now?
Tobi the rizz master. He can't beat the allegations now
so at what time does the vid acc start
joshs mom contact being the fat lion😭
Eii yooo we want part 2 guys!!!!!!!
part 2 plz
Simon could have got more points if he sent another reply.
💯💯💯
someone send tobi to dubai
How many likes or comments, for Tobi to go to HABIBI 😂
i wanted to see Fillys reply ffs
This is arguably the best MoreSidemen vid I've ever watched 😭😭😭
cooolll mann igg
card against humanity vibes
Why music play a half way through
They need to do a longer video of this
This thumbnail is outrageous 😭
Stolen from the Inbetweeners
we need a part 2 soon
they need to do this again!!
Is the game link not working for anyone else?
Your sets look always amazing so: Shoutout Lucy
50 seconds in it feels like viks made the game and ethan harry and josh all think its a hooner
Rizz master Tobi
tobi has 2 phones?
Whose idea was the thumbnail lmao
Nah this was too funny😅😅
Tobi made this episode the best I have ever seen !!!!!!!!!!
Goated Game RRRRR❤❤❤❤❤RRRRR
Petition to buy Tobi the ticket for Dubai
these are such sellouts man, its so sad because most of their fans are underage
🎉
I aint got enough friends for that
shouldnt the person who's card gets picked, get a point as well?
Great video do it again
Part 2 When?????????????????????????????????
Tobi wins ez
Harry plugging the "out in stores" great comedic timing
We need part 2
Harry’s promotional at the end 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂of
implied incest straight on the thumbnail is mad
These guys are just the biggest sellouts now.
I love how Simon had to look to the camera and go “But I like Callux” he is so haunted from Spill Your Guts lmfao
It costs 25 quid 😂😂
we NEED a part 2
We want Hide seek back!!!!!!!! We want Hide seek back!!!!!!!! We want Hide seek back!!!!!!!! We want Hide seek back!!!!!!!! We want Hide seek back!!!!!!!! We want Hide seek back!!!!!!!! We want Hide seek back!!!!!!!!
I thought it was a app😐
Fuck sake I really want more from this game it’s really jokes!! We need a part 2 or a series lol of this
YEAH HABIBI
The zoom in on Harry when Vik said anyone can be on the line 😂
So is Tobi in dubai or what?😂
Tobi jeeeeez
Harry the sellout hshaga
This could have easily been faked.
Great vid guys
It should be that the loser has to send the riskiest text from whoever everyone else chooses
This is the first time in a long time I’ve laughed insanely hard with a Youtube video! This game is so fun to watch you guys play 😭
tobi really dropped some of the best promotion for a game I've ever seen 🤣🤣
PART 2!!! PART 2!!! PART 2!!!
Behz to Tobi > Dalot to Garnacho
It would be really cool to see them do a multi-round game of this. Maybe on Side+?
Another one please!😂
the guys already so tired, they probably filmed 5 of these moresidemen sessions in one day, trying to hype up each other XD
Lol😂😂😂😂
The one who gets his text picked should get a point aswell, makes it more competitive pointwise
would accept this as a mukbang for main challange and more backstory to the text/double down harder
Focus on sidemen among us
Thumbnail is mad 💀
Imagine she becomes Tobis new gyal😂 behz on some kdb shit😂😂😂
Only thing that would make this better is forfeits for not doing
This game is gonna get violent for somebody😂😂😂
so cards against humanity rebranded
The letters should be ratio'd with common names with emphasis on M & D for parents
Part 2??????
i feal like the boys are pumping so meny things that me as an og sideman fan cinda feal like there hiere for money now not for us like back in the day i use to watch the vids when i wose 13 now am 18 and i have seen almoast all the videos all am saying in the last sidemansonday u prmomted a lot of things still love the vids but cinda feals like ur turining in to to moutch
I can't buy the game 😢😢 Because there is no option for Germany 😭😭
trust vikk to opt out
Simon is a scoundrel 😂😂
Harry's plug in at the end had me 😂😂😂😂
This is an amazing marketing idea. You're leveraging the fact that you are a famous group of friends to target groups of friends as a demographic for a product, yiu should do this more often
I waited for this an entire day finallyyyy
https://youtu.be/rMS_fymeV6Q?si=l-Si8uC1KBHBUk-P
Need round 2 of this ASAP
Petition for tobi to do a 20v1 before the end of the year...
please more of these vids
For those of you wondering, the girl that wanted Tobi is Gabriella Deith😂
I HAVE NEVER LOLLED SO HARD 😂😂😂😂
Another banging Sidemen Video that ends prematurley 😞
I wish i had friends to play this with  😂
Tobi I need lesson plz 😢😅😭

BROO💀💀💀😂😂😂
part 2 pls
I can't lie these lot got some dirty socks 😂 why wear white if you know your socks are hella dirty smh. KSI & Simon the only ones with white socks that are clean
This video needs several parts; goated game🤣
Laughed so hard my chest hurts
Simon saying “With a picture” was tooooo funny 😂
No way sidemen made a game before GTA 6 💀
Come to Dubai habibi
p2 when ?
Ah Vik you should've texted about Tannar.
And josh was never seen again😅😅
Really like this new concept hopefully they play more random games on moresidemen, there always the best videos 🤣
this was SO entertaining bruv I hope they make this a whole series 😭 😭😭😭
So basically Cards against humanity text version. At least they brought back a classic
Years later the boys have made their very own Cards Against Humanity 👏🏾
simon missing viks joke about owning up is funny
We need a Part 2
That was so funnnnyyyy
ayo the thumbnail bruh
This needs a part 2 😂😂😂
Part 2 and 2 rounds plzzzzz
well you guys can do a sideman sunday with this game awesome
TOBI BOOK THAT FLIGHT
We need a longer video of this!!!! Brings back cards against humanity vibes!!!!
Ethan and Simon were cooking in the corner with their messages
WE NEED MORE
This might be the best card game promo ever
elite game play this again
I need to know what josh’s mum replied
Congratulations to Tobi.
i would play this but i have like no contacts just my family and one friend
I feel like this video could’ve definitely used a few more rounds but it was still great nonetheless
There needs to be a part 2 of this
The loser needs a punishment!! 😂 the game will be more intense
25£ for a card game is robbery as much as I love you guys..
I need this as online game
Tobi ain’t beating the allegations
I think we all can agree that WE NEED MORE
Tobi Rizzle
Tobi Rizzler
Fun game, out now! 😂
More of this
UNDER AN HOUR GAAAAAAAANG
id be down to see them  play magic the gathering commander
plz do a part 2 this is my favourite game on more sideman plz do an part 2
W wingmen
19:12  what did he said... I can't really hear him...??
Tobi is moving madd😂
Honestly this could be a heleirous series if they continue with the scores
I'm giggling at this whole ordeal 😂 Tobi has always been the rizzler
Sidemen are such sell outs these days
This is such a funny game to play at a sleepover lmao
This was so fun to watch!
The vibrator one caused some commotion 😂😂 something we don’t know lol
Tobi: The God of Rizz
Lowkey we need more of these vids
part 2 with more people would be crazy
Only og sidemen fans can lick my taint
Im tired of this comment 'only Og sidemen fans can like this comment ' bruh get something new to comment 😭 literally every where
I'm in germany, can't get it😢
PART TWO
So the game is basically apples to apples but with texting and acc doing it
Part 2
We all needs suppotive friends like sidemen 😂❤
What’s the game called?
😭
Where can I buy this game 😂😂
Sidegents my home state in America has the most INSANE location for a hide and seek. I know they’re not going to take suggestions from a comment (I get it) but I urge you to check out “Meow Wolf” in Colorado. It’s soo trippy and Full of hidden doors and secrets it would make for such a crazy hide and seek. Love you all
WE NEED PART 2 this is jokes😂😂😂😂
Harry has a future in Ad reads with these shills 😂
I wish the sidemen could do this with normal people lol but no honestly yous are all amazing keep it up
Yo harry's sudden promotion had me CRYING
I think to amp up the game you all put phones on do not disturb for 10mins before checking😌
These guys should've did the text first then the person.
This has got to be one of the best MoreSidemen video in a while
Tobi get laid just because of this 😂😂😂😂
Finally a good sidemen video in years🎉😂
And Tobi wonders why he gets the allegations .... 😂😂
This feels like Cards Against Humanity but mixed with roulette text messaging.
Best Sidemen channel, not even close.
$50 for this game is mad ngl
I actually like this game but have more guest like freezy, callux and few others would be jokes
The fact that Josh’s mom never care to reply lol
JJ with the  13 mini in his hands will forever be a memory in my head
I would love to see the sidemen play Lethal Company
TobiRizzle with the "I can be"
Man I wish this was longer 😂 that’s an amazing game lol
I wanted to see filly's replie so bad 😂
100 % we need part 2😂😂 I'm dying of laughter.
Kidney touching video 😍
Tobrizzle
Gunna be making Sidemen condoms next
100k in half an hour is crazy
Part 2 will go crazy
tobi rizz unmatched
Just tried to buy the game.. Not available in the US yet but I'll be waiting!!
You guys definitely need to play this again!
Part 2 when??? 😂
Nah bruh you can't go out from the game like that
Only ishowspeed fans can like this comment
that boy look busy nvm he getting RIZZZY. tobi with the w fizz
U have to do more of this game
this is one of the best videos they’d made this year on the channel
25 quid. Can’t do anything without it being a sellable product nowadays
Love this, cards against humanity vibes
This definitely needs to be another video banger
Tryna make more money
There needs to be a part 2 for this game. This was so funny 😂
Ksi doesn’t do Rizz, he is Rizz😂
you guys should do this more as it's so funny. also can bring in others to do the game as well. Love your videos. x
Lmao that disclaimer that popped up😂😂
WTF Broski 🤣🤣🤣
vikk should've called in sick for this one
Petition to make more videos of this game, it's hilarious 😂
We need a 1 hour vid of this game
100k comments in 30 mins is wild at tbh
We need a 2 Part :)
Tobi the fantasy rizzler😌💪🏼💪🏼
viks text that he gave ksi was dead and boring
What a great fing video, I thought you guys would just fake the shit out if it but your reactions were way to genuine, how about this if you guys okay it again I'll buy another pack of the cards
Boem, klap, mijn billen doen pijn Kak op mijn romein
Wanted to see Josh's mom's reply😂
worst game for introverts with no contacts
Tobrizzle
This is great👍
Sidemen assuming I have more than 5 contacts
The editor putting that avatar on Josh's mum is crazy
Part 2!!!
Already a classic
This was a quality video. I've had a smile on my face from start to finish, simple but really funny content. Keep it up my dudes
This is like old school cards against humanity on seteroids, love it !
19:10 havent laughed this much in a while now🤣
this video was hilarious
Up there with cards against humanity
these guys are the best hypemen
Banging vid loved it.. 😂 immediately went to buy the game US coming soon 😢 dang it
This was an amazing watch, maybe next time a loser forfeit aswell👀
I want more but it's kinda bait if some of their contacts already watched this :<
Please continue this series and new content
Needed 2 rounds of this
Got me waiting since the short 😅 but aye perfect timing got my lasagne ready to eat
this was jokes
It sucks doing this video again people will probably have a hunch bc it’s literally your game, but another is already needed
We need to have more
I only comment when the video is too good
I hour gang 🎊🎊
This concept is ass
What a fun video!!😂
What a great video, makes me love the sidemen even more
Behz with the assist what a man
We need more vids of this game please 😂
Such a fun video
Brooo, this video was actually so jokes 😂 we need a part 2 asap 🔥

So glad the Sidemen finally made their own game 😂😂😂
We needed Filly's reply 😂😂😂 and a part 2 ASAP

quality game but u need lots of contacts
Great vid kings!!
This is a great video
Only OG sidemen … SHUT UP
Yo we need updates from Tobis date btw :)
Best Sidemen Video in yearssssss😂
18:23 wtf was that?!?!? Lol
Need one more round 😅

Tobi, How was the date??
Nah man this video is too short I want more😢
Tobi better have been on that flight Friday!
B4 1 hr gang
I need a part 2 to this, this was so funny.😭😭
Love the editor, that "Disclaimer" was funny
This video is jokes, they should defintely play it again
We definitely need one more video on this 😂😂
One of the best Sidemen videos in a while
TOBI RIZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
The only complaint I have is that it’s not longer. What a fun concept haha

This was fun to watch need part two of thi❤❤
Need more of this
tobrizzle
Similar like cards against humanity but i love it❤
TOBRIZZLE still got it
I wanted an hour
Tobi the rizzler
Thumbnail is mental
We need more pls 😢
a
so did Tobi fly to Dubai? :D
Need a part 2 longer
That thumbnail is on point would love to see another one of these videos again class idea
“WTF Broski wrong person?!“ 😂😂😂
4:14, the editor made her pfp a fat lion 😂😂😂
Ok
Josh got aired by is own mother lol.
Idk why this made me laugh so much. Gotta play it again in the future with a twist or something like forfeits. Without squash balls probably
Saw a shorts of this earlier before the video I was confused asf 😂
I'm 5 minutes in this video, and it is absolutely fucking hilarious! Enjoying this game
Need a series
They did this in the very last episode of the inbetweeners I swear
Take it im the only one who saluted the magpie at 18:25? 😂
Can believe Harry was peer pressured into not doing the funniest one at the start. Texting his mum saying he’s always been attracted to her is so funny.
genuinely enjoyed this vid a lot more than i thought i would
We want more among us vids!
Tobi Brown ❌ Tobi Boxeater ✅
Definitely do this again, this was fun to watch
Part 2? Thanks!
Please do more of this, cracked me up 🤣
We need another video playing this game😂
i hope they do a part 2, this shit was hilarious  Edit: 14k likes and only 30 comments, where them comment wars at?
Ohhhh so that’s what the email was about 💀
The thumbnail is brazy😅
tobi with the rizz
I can't lie I wanna watch a sidemen video where they don't  shill
The first time a sponsor vid has actually been good.
Hello
that thumbnail is crazy
Looking forward to Tobi's Friday story🤭
Tobibi
I got a theory. JJ depressed. That’s why he’s always kinda quite and acts weird. I think he acts weird and outrageous sometimes because he’s trying to simulate how he use to act. It could also just means he’s mature tho and forgot how he use to act. Ik it sounds like I’m stalking the dude but I’m just really observant😂
Lesgooo
Send a copy to smosh games
Gotta get a part two fr
Tobi with the rizzz. Should change the channel name to tbrzl (tobrizzle)😂😂
Only og beta squad fans can like this comment 😎👊🏽
If we get a Dubai special Sidemen sunday in the near future we all know what really happened 👀
your gay if you don't like this, also ethan still fat 👨🏻‍🦰
fireeeeeeeee
The way they all cheered tobi ❤😂😂
Sidemen just advertise atp not even make a vid for the sake of making a vid lmao they turning into sell outs imo besides Simon and josh also maybe tobi
This video is actually hilarious, haven’t laughed so much in a while! Need more parts of this!!!❤
These lot are scamming a living with these side quests, no pun intended

Fuck I hope this becomes a regular thing
TOBI is HIMMMMMMMM 🎉
thumbnail is outrageous
You can make this into a Drinking game, where if you dont wanna send the text, you have to take a shot. Honestly a goated drinking game
This is literally cards against humanity but less explicit 😂
Tobi the goat
by the end of the party, everybody is on their phone. nice 10min party game. cant wait to buy it
So they made cards against humanity but it’s texting
Tobi's a Rizzler, he's so Skibidi
That thumbnail text is outrageous
Sidemen Send to All
Genuinely loved this one, Got me grinning all the way through.
Amazing game, will ruin a lot of friendship
I’ve been waiting for this ever since that short u guys posted abt tobis text message
Ksi text vikkram paki please
