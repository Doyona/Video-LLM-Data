0:15 Who else thought UCLA was going to win? Damn
Primetime otw...Colorado 2024
Wow the Ucla QB lost the game
USC always be beating ucla ass like they little brother 😂
The call from 1:12 until 1:20 is exactly why I hate when that guy calls games
That was a crazy game! I thought UCLA would sneak away with it for sure.
I LOVE THIS ONE 💪💯❤️🐺
I LOVE THIS ONE 💪💯❤️🐺
That’s right SC all day baby!
Great job S.C !!!!
the editing on this is… questionable. please hire me lol
I like the former,  lighter blue, powdery blue uniform color of UCLA better. It was most unusual.

If it isn’t SEC football I really don’t care. All other conference are high schoolers.
LOL oh look barely squeaking by with a dub. Just what Lincoln Riley is good at. They'll get embarrassed on the national stage.
Kyle Ford catch was incredible  !!
Amazing game!

You know it's gonna be a great rest of the year whenever USC beats UCLA. Damn proud of my boys. Fight On Trojan family. USC > Kings of Los Angeles.
More exciting then any NFL game this year
Love you.  USC won!!!
I'm no longer part of the church of the brethren, I divorced
I can believe this is pac12! Way to go!
FUCK THE TROJANS, MAN
Tech won Nikes
OMG. I almost turned it off it was so stressful at the punt. Thank God I didn't. OMG. What a game. What a team at my alma mater. Fight on!
Llluuuccckkkyyyyyyy. Doubt they beat ND. WILL get killed in playoffs if they play Georgia first round or second
Utah beat usc. Oregon beat Utah. Hmmm....
This was a great game Saturday. #22 USC
They’re back!!!!
Great game both winners amazing game
Lincoln Riley: 3-0 vs Chip Kelly, DTR, and UCLA.
Forever in USC-UCLA lore: “Korey’s Pick.”
Never trust a hyphen person in a leadership position, especially sports.
Caleb and cocach Riley at the end thats what ota all about
Difference in the game....a Chip Kelly time out.
DTR quit on the team. Lost at home against sorry Arizona and cracked on the final drive against USC.
good game Riley .. Ou fan saying this..
Not the best highlights.
No defense was played on this night
I knew DTR was going to throw a pick. Thats what he does
fuck that pulic school
I started my day with TCU vs Baylor then Ohio State vs Maryland in the middle and my nightcap was USC vs UCLA. Awesome day of college football, too bad the NFL doesn't have the same energy.
Whoo-hoo! Go Trojans! 🛡
Meanwhile....  In Norman....
Incredible game. So much NFL talent on the field
Wow… great highlight. Short n’ sweet.
Great game
! The monkey is on whose back now? Putting up 60 on who? Lol congratulations Trojans, RB silenced. Fight On!
우클라 와 우스크. But doesn't 우클라 대 have more mileage from there school  get to Rose bowl stadium in Pasadena ?  I thought major rose buds are grown in New Jersey not Pasadena CA?
Was at the game last night. What an awesome game! Glad the Trojans held on for the win.
UCLA loses alot of talent.  UCLA will be dog shit next year and for sometime.  Just sayin..
SC finish off the Irish and either of course Mich or OSU loses, SC will be in the top 4 going into the conference title game.  LSU will get curb stomped by GA. GA, TCU, Mich or OSU, and USC will be the top 4
Good Game!!! Even though it took a Few Yrs off my life...Offense was Great ( Williams was Beast but he Made a Almost Critical play that could have given the bruins the Game)...(It doesn't show on this video)...S.C. was moving the Ball it was 2nd Down and 9...He snapped the ball had all day to Run..Instead he over threw the receiver (Falo) the Next Play he was Sacked...A Great Play by Foreman Saved S.C. on next Series for the Win!!...Special teams was Also Shakey missed field goals ....Short kickoffs.. Got to Fight on S.C.✌️🏈❤️💛
Did I just watch a flag football game?
More exciting then any NFL game this year
Trojans move up in rankings thanks vols 🐸🐗🐧
What a game.
No hats, no gloves, no scarfs, no heavy goats.  Do these two programs know what they’re facing in the BigTen in late November?  Right now it’s 15 degrees in Michigan.  Some parts of the region have 6 feet of snow.  USC and UCLA will not be able to have a track meet on an icy frozen field.
Talk about two teams w Zero D. A Pop Warner QB could put up Heisman stats….embarrassing
Awesome game!
USC's going to the Rose Bowl!
That is phenomenal job Lincoln has done ,in only his first year,what clay helton had done to the program,I was thinking would take a lot longer to correct,how did Lincoln do it
The return of usc?😵‍💫
SoCal back on the map baby!
✌️✌️✌️
You know it's gonna be a great rest of the year whenever USC beats UCLA. Damn proud of my boys. Fight On Trojan family. USC > Kings of Los Angeles.
FIGHT ON!!!!!!
As an ND fan, I'm looking forward to next week's matchup.
Defense?😂
Good game but if SC wants to be elite they have to start recruiting bigger faster  defense lineman from the point of impact like in the pete carrol era
Definitely a BIG worthy rivalry... awesome game!
👏👏👏👏👏👏
💙❤😉👍🏻🇺🇸
thanks for all the free interceptions lol. Fight On!
U-C-L-A SUCKS! -Fleetwood Mac FIGHT ON! ✌️
Southern Cal leads the nation in turnover margin, something they did well in the Pete Carroll era
0:15  Who else thought USC was done? Fight on!
If Utah beats Oregon tonight, rematch?
Thank goodness Gus Johnson was on the call
Heisman Time! Fight On! ✌🏈 ❤ 💛
As a SC fan great win terrible defense
✌🏾🔴🟡😤
Wow...what a game! FIGHT ON!
Great game from the USC Trojans
Offensive showcase. To many bruin turnovers
Go Trojans! Keep pushing Darwin Barlow! God is making room for you!  #22
pretty weak defense for both teams. uclaqb 3 interceptions. 60 pts? not today
Talk about a passionate game 💯👏🏼& emotions with anxiety to be this close of a game. Good job by both teams 👏🏼, MAD RESPECTS, but Fight on ✌🏻🔴🟡. Let’s go USC!!!
PAC 12 football is back!
Alex Grinch looks lost it's like he just arrived earth for the first time and was told to coach defense
FightOn
Fight On!!  ✌✌
Thompson-Robinson played his heart out mad respect
✌🏾
