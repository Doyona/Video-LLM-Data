We are back! Should have these weekly until the start of the season. Squad update just before that 👊
Archie Cane is an absolute baller, plays for bowers and pitsea
What step are hashtag?
Where's Jermaine Francis gone?
Lew is looking sharp because he's finally healthy again.  If he stays healthy, he can be one of the best players in the league.  He was a man among boys at the last tier until his injury.  I'm pulling for him big time as well.
the dribble from the left winger before your second goal was quality. baits in the defender and then sends him.
sad to lose Jermaine, but we wish him all the best (as we did w Brookes). hope to see their names in the football league somewhere down the line. Jermaine is a huge loss, but i think Sakariya Hassan looks like an absolute baller. its cool that he's been capped by Somalia as well, but that may mean that we are w out him for a few matches when he's on international duty (imagine saying that when Hashtag first started out - being worried about not having a player due to int'l duty, rather than job commitments)
10:14 who tf is playing mr brightside
Just one more successful season, and we can play you in unmodded FM25. Good luck!
Where is Jermaine
Zakariye What a player He is Very Good And Competitive, All he need to do More is to Come back And To practice his Shoots More
Sakariya hasn't been talked about enough! He's looked like a real baller, and capped at the international level to top it off! I feel like he'll light it up for the tags
don't forget to hashtag it 👑
Ill be counting the day when scotty P and Jermain sign back to hashtag 1 day !❤❤
Some of these new guys seem fantastic. Very interested
Albie Keith! !!
I am so excited i love this video
Great vlog hashtag United and go to see the lads back in pre-season training, games ready for the new season, up the tags ##⚽️
Who’s the pure unit wearing 2?!!??? Hope to be seeing him up top 😅
number 9 for bowers and pitsea, proper player to watch out for scored 55 goals last season
played against that buckhurst hill striker in pre season before. He's decent.
I am so sad to see Jermaine go. He was one of my favorite players
I am so sad to see Jermaine go. He was one of my favorite players
AT better hold that spot was one of the crucial players from last season
Where's man like jarmine😏
sak is going to ball out at hashtag
The fact we don’t get to see JF link up with Sak Hassan is gutting
why did Jermain leave
ive been saying this for ages.finally
promotion
I advocate that Joni can be himself LET HIM SWEAR
Hashtag United going stronger than Twitter at this point!!    ###########
Reckon Hashtag will do well this season. Also go and get Morrison Hachii as someone said in the chat. The amount of goals he got last season is unbelievable for semi pro. Young as well.
LETS GO! WELCOME BACK
Best of luck in your season
Sakariya 🇸🇴
Farai is back finally 🎉
No jinky m jinky this season?
Saka on the left looked really good, gonna be a good combo with the new tall strong striker 😉
Higsy is levels man
Farai is back FINALLY !!
Loving the unity with the boys, the new signings looking good. Looking a little rusty, but thats what pre-season is about! Looking great from set pieces though, lets get it! Up the Tags! #💛💙
Stamps is such a legend is crazy how he came from the academy and he is a big part of the tags
get kieran signed up asappp!
No jermaine 🥺
holy shit this Sak guy is electric. Wonderful Francis replacement
He eman and pedro left then ?
UPDATE: I now have a trim.
How long till the season starts
Nice to see some new faces but sad to see some old go.
Tags are back!
Sign Higgsy! He is an impact player. Even if its just him being a super sub.
Bro
I would love to see a midfield three of lewis watson, joni vukaj and max cornhill 🔥🔥🔥
we need more LP absolute hashtag legend
Did jermaine francis leave ?
What about Jermaine Francis
Jermaine regen already secured
Surprised wooldridge wasn’t offered a deal by a team a league higher tbh
The lad in the midfield second half looked decent. Hard to judge off of two highlights but looked sharp. Winnin the ball back deep and then driving forward and his pass to Lewis was nice aswell. Cud b a big player if signed
Didn't know AJ from Beta Squad was like that
Why didnt i see jermaine francis and pedro carvalho on the retained list?🥺
Very nice editing with the sakariha clip
Cant wait til the squad update then the matchday vids. I had a 100% record watching em last season..UP THE TAGS
Sak looks a player and sound lad
So great to see Farai Tsingano in training ⚽️ #️⃣
Max will never back out of a header even when he should. When Watson got moved up front I was a little confused but he got his goal and should of had a second 🙈 another strong season ahead
Has jermaine and Pedro left?
Who was the homeless guy we interviewed at halftime? I’m all for getting the locals involved but seemed a bit strange.
Jamaine 😩😩😩
It'd be difficult to replace Jermaine Francis.
Woulda been a great video if someone cleaned the camera 🥲
higgsy the goat tbh
Finally hastag is backlkkk
Honestly, cannot have imagined as a football fan being gutted to lose a non-league player, but Jermaine hits me hard. Shows how much progress Hashtag have made that players the calibre of him come through and yet I'm confident that the club can replace with equally high quality due to the pull of the club. All the best Jermaine, and Up The Tags!
Is it just me or is spen starting to look like Barry Chuckle in his prime TV Days? @16:22
New ST looks a big strong lad
Number 2 looks abit big to be playing full back 😅
KIERAN HIGGSSSSSSSSS  WHAT A PLAYA
No carvalho or Francis 😢
You need higgsy!!!
Shame to see Jermaine go, in looking forward to watching the squad update video to see the reason why… Hopefully it’s because he got an opportunity at a higher level. But excited for the season ahead and can’t wait to watch the boys smash it!
I love Kieran higgs 😍
My wllka Sak yk...welcome Apti 😂🐐
The video we’ve all been waiting for⚡️ @Higgsy
bros signed AJ Shabeel
That pass at 19:00 is filthy
4:07 Ooh the Hummel jumper is interesting
Sign in me
😮sign in me
Hopefully be seeing you guys in Worthing on the 22nd! It'll be my first game!
L.P good to see his face again
Pumped for the season boys. Up the tags! #
I’m already in love with the idea the boy Higgsy is teaming with the tags❤
Whoever that zambo anguissa looking guy in midfield is looks class
When are the league fixtures out ???
Who have left so far apart from Jermaine, Eman and Pedro?
Good to see Kieran!
higgsy on the thumbnail 😮‍💨
Solid start to pre-season! Can comfortably say the video doesn’t portray how hard Devs has been running us…😅 (allow the sun burnt face)
Suley is WHAM bloody hell
Excited for the new season ahead
My boy higgsey
Morrison Hachii in the 10th tier would be crazy for Hashtag 76 goals
Let’s go
Just what i needed on a Monday evening
Higgsy
Here we go
First
I'm excited for this season there's gonna be lots of competition for people up front like sak,Toby,teniola,sueley and higgsy
