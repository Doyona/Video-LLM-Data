eh deusa
Hi Miley, I just came here to tell you that people from Brazil are making meme of the song that you keep saying "And I had a dream", and I'm also from Brazil, my mother and I saw the translated clip and we found it very sad in the part where you cried, and it was subtitled for the Brazilians to see, and even so, they keep laughing, but there were some who understood about the video, that's all, I was laughing but now I don't want to laugh anymore, I'm sorry :(
Im not fan of miley but this cover was amazing, the original singer was pround of you

I NEED A MILEY AND CHER TOUR!!!
She sounds so much like Dolly!
Miley’s physique is incredible.
Where's chad Michaels when you need him
There is one right way back home, only one Name to get saved- Jesus. He is the real (Word of) God, there is only one Spirit of the everlasting love- it is Christ, who loves unconditionally .  Everybody can meet Him and realize, what He really is like. He tells the truth directly to everyone, who is searching for Him from the bottom of the heart. Jesus Christ is so much different than they wrote and talk about Him in this world. He is so much better than the people think.  There is no other God's Name, no other Spirit, nobody who can tell the truth about Him- I mean everyone who hasn' t met Him or doesn't hear His voice. When somebody talks about things, which were written, he becomes a witness of a scripture, not of Jesus Christ.  This world is not His Kingdom, that's why it is full of lies, which the people called "truth". Call His holy Name, He always answers when all we want is Him and His truth.. If you belive in Jesus Christ, you should be babtized in His Name... Ask the Holy Spirit to fill you and you can listen to the Word of GOD in your heart. . GOD will let you know that you are saved and born again.  And then?  Will you be searching for Him somewhere else or by someone else, when He will live inside of you? The bible is not the true Word of God, there are two different gospels of this book- about the "lord" of this world (flesh) and the second one about Jesus Christ, The Revealed God, who became a human to save us..  We can be (spirituallly) born again now as children of the only true Father (The Holy Ghost). If you (still) want to read this book, please remember- always ask the Holy Spirit to guide you, even when you see things written about Jesus.

Jesus is your way to heaven, he paid the price for your sins. Once you believe you are sealed and saved forever. Salvation is a free gift.
This is cover of a Frank Sinatra song. I've got you under my skin.  BUT it's the singer Storm Large so sang it on AGT.... that version... she made is perfect for her and I believe for Miley Cyrus to sing it that way as her voice has change to a more salty sound.  She is sexy and this version .. if she did it this way would be a bigger hit!!!! https://youtu.be/rlwvLR4feNI
Loved it…!!!
Miley might as well be a dude because she will NEVER have children.
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Para los que hablan español, después de Cher nadie había interpetado tan magistral esta canción.

It took a lot of balls to be on that stage... ugh, never mind.
She'd double her streaming numbers if she released every cover she's done officially. I have a whole downloaded playlist on my phone that I listen to daily.
She can sing any song. Her voice is one of the best. We're alive at the same time as her. Insanity!

My car has been broke down for 2 yrs and I have too walk everywhere. I have been pulled over walking, 7 times and searched. In 400,000 miles in my other car I got pulled over 1 time.
Why? I don't need yaw for anything. And, yaw were extremely clear on your feeling for me. I don't know Cinderfella. He knows me and used that and drugs and tried too beat me with all the money and help on Earth and lost.
Jennifer bailed on me and sold out for pocket change. So, did everyone, I got no one and nowhere too go. I don't want too die, but, yaw had this planned, since, I was born. I fucked you up with your own game, Playa! You can tunnel under me all you want. Flood me and drowned me, put me in prison. I will have 2,000 roommates. They don't bother me, they are honest about being dishonest. Yaw are another level that is for sure. I hope it was worth it. Later
No, never met him, I was just bored. I sent them too his Mom's house around the block.
Tell Him, I am outside his house. I sent 4,000 Russian brides too Kiki Mengo's house and used your credit card. Thanks
When the real Jennifer reads all this, she is gonna lose it on yaw. Have yaw seen this guy? He is reading my mind and texting it. Your new girlfriend, we know a little about you through the lies they told. They were about your life, but, like a bad storyteller he was just repeating like a parrot. He knew nothing when questioned. Jennifer bashed his skull in. Jennifer says, She loves you.
Miley is smiling and says, "The 1st thing out of Mr. Little Jimmy is I don't do Top 40 music or girly music. See, Mr. Little Jimmy isn't supposed too be standing over there. He is showing someone he cares that had no hope. He can't fix everything or everyone. He is a normal guy, trying too help a few people that he can't find.
Gran músic ✌️🌍🇱🇷 ✌️  1 GRAN   Voize mirley Cyrus 🌍

Good ingles ✌️🇱🇷💪🇱🇷 good cover  un voize
This cover is stuck in my mind. Literally. I just start randomly singing this song 😭
Sou apaixonada nesta mulher! Fantástica
I think Miley Cyrus is the only female artist that is a real feminist, LGBT community supporter and such a human being on this world. The only thing is that industry always try to put her as the rebel girl or the "controversial Disney girl" when she's the most unproblematic person.
Believe Cher amazing
Literally the best remake of this song ever!! Especially to help get over someone. Turn it up and dance along!!!! “You’re gonna be the lonely one.” Dah dee dah!! ❤️❤️
Literally the best remake of this song ever!! Especially to help get over someone. Turn it up and dance along!!!!
We need a concert in the uk with just cover songs. There’s not one song she covers where you think “fuck she’s ruined it” they all sound just as good or better ❤️
Mi Diosa😍
It was awesome I love you Miley

You are amazing 🌈💕

A copy from Cher!
好きだ!!!!!!!💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Excelente interpretación de Miley Cirus de "Believe".
I haven't seen such a brilliant recital in a long time.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Miley, I don't think that you will ever read this, but can you please make another album singing Summertime Sadness and Wicked Game?! There is something so majestic about your voice. When you sing you transport the lyrics. I need more of you for my Amazon Music 🎶
I miss Hannah montana😭
God loves you Miley Cyrus, despite everything, he loves you, knows you, look for him, the Son of God Jesus Christ is looking for you. Jesus Christ the Son of God will not abandon you look for him, Miley Cyrus loves you. God calls you, knows you, sees you right now. Jesus will not abandon you.
400 pound drags singing with Miley to Cher. What more could you want?
Perfect
There should be an album of her covers on Spotify 😭😭
Hello  miley me you fan #1 🤘💪🐍🐢🌼
Is that Miley’s mom/dad?
Happy pride!
❤️
I really need this on Spotify so I can play it on repeat
Jesus is the Father! John10:30 I and my Father are one. John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures. Colossians 2:8-9 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the traditions of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.  The King James Video Ministries, AccountableKJV, and Sinners to repentance are good ministries to follow!  The KJV is the word of God!
Its just amazing!!    btw do we have this cover on Spotify ?
Because of our sins we have been separated from a holy God. But God, in his mercy, love, and grace, sent Jesus to die in our place (we deserve eternal punishment for breaking God's law), so that we wouldn't have to die. If we put our faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ we will be saved and begin a true and intimate relationship with God. Life doesn't become easier being a Christian, but it is worth it. ❤❤❤
❤❤
this is a masterpiece!
I'm waiting for your next song....I love them all

To your heart: "I will praise you because I was formed so fearrfully and wonderfully. Wonderful are your works and my soul knows it very well." (Psalm 139:14). Hi. Your life is God's design. From the womb, God dreamed of you and traced a path. Will we choose God's plans, or ours? Jesus is the Way, the truth and the life and no one comes to the Father without Christ. Invoke him and he will sustain you and lead you, in love, to his purposes of peace and salvation. His care will supply you. His comfort and faithfulness will strengthen you. You are precious to God. Pray. Read the Bible. Jesus will return soon.Greetings. From Brazil.🙏

Her voice is so beautiful that it reminds me of the '90s✨
Miley, you are VERY talented ...you have a VERY beautiful voice, & I like your music. But what I like about you the most is your ability to BOLDLY stand up for what you believe in as well as take a stand for others who are less fortunate, regardless of what anybody thinks. You go girl!😊

No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside And I can't break through There's no talking to you  So sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all is said and done You're gonna be the lonely one, oh  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now  What am I supposed to do? Sit around and wait for you? Well, I can't do that There's no turning back  I need time to move on I need love to feel strong 'Cause I've had time to think it through And maybe I'm too good for you, oh  Do you believe in life after love?

I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now  Well, I know that I'll get through this 'Cause I know that I am strong I don't need you anymore  Oh, I don't need you anymore I don't need you anymore No, I don't need you anymore  Do you believe in life after love?

I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now

I'm obsessed with this 💗
She's the only singer i admire when it comes to lgbt

Legend
Queen of lgbt
Divine.
For a bunch of queens doing a Cher number, they are serving ZERO energy.
Miley is So Amazing!!! 😍❤️
Versão ficou foda!
Your energy on this performance give me goosebumps every time I watch it. [And I've watched it a lot of times already! Believe me...]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krNNMFpA1wY
Is it me or does she honestly look truly happy now?? She makes me so happy.
Qué buena versión!! Nunca decepciona
Miley needs to stop jumping all over dads car for attention and realize she has a beautiful voice if she does it right.  Stop looking for attention for the wrong things and find attention in the right things..focus on your voice..focus on your future
Parece um episódio de RUPALS
Miley cyrus like you is amazing I've been in love with you since the time of Hanna Montana I admire you the most and the biggest inspiration anyone can have you are cute i love you
Love Cher
She’s an amazing performer. Period.

She finally looks so happy to be on stage singing, it looks like she enjoys it more than ever!
Well I thought Adam Lambert’s version is the best until I hear Miley’s cover. I need this on spotify! 😎😍
"Bigger Than Us" (from "Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus" soundtrack)  L.O.V.E. oh L.O.V.E. L.O.V.E. oh L.O.V.E.   I see your face, I look in your eyes What you feel is no surprise Everyone needs something to believe in  Tell me your dreams and I'll tell you mine In our hearts we'll look inside And see all the colors of a rainbow I know   We all want to believe in love We all want to believe in something Bigger than just us We all want to be a part Of the greater picture That's hanging in our hearts Yeah it's bigger than us   I want to see beyond my own little world Grab your hand so we can twirl around the galaxy See the world with clarity Oh, oh we have such a long way to go But I know, we're getting closer every day, every day     It fills the universe Lights the skies above It rescues all our hearts with love (L.O.V.E. love) With love...(L.O.V.E. love) That's what's bigger than us (bigger than us come on!) It's love, it's love that's bigger than us It's love, it's love that's bigger than us It's love, it's love it's love it's love it's love it's love We all wanna believe in love We all wanna believe in something Bigger than just us
🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍
She's everything I need right now 😍
What a good cover 👍
Ela é simplesmente maravilhosa.
Miley, YOUR ARE NOT Billy Idol. So please quit stealing his moves and using his trademark lip contortion. You really look silly. Maybe get some bolt ons then you can look like Dolly.
No cabe duda que los covers de Miley Cyrus son una joya. Te amo 🇲🇽🇨🇴🏳️‍🌈
Yaaaasss my kylie Love is there giving it!! 💕

Can't wait for South Park to cover this. That was HILARIOUS!!! 🤣 It had it all... 400 lb drag queens, manly Miley, and all stage dancing to Cher!!! What an escapade. You can't make this stuff up. THANK YOU FOR THE LAUGH!!!
After love, after love After love, after love After love, after love  No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside And I can't break through There's no talking to you  So sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all is said and done You're gonna be the lonely one, oh  Do you believe in life after love?

I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now  What am I supposed to do? Sit around and wait for you? Well, I can't do that There's no turning back  I need time to move on I need love to feel strong 'Cause I've had time to think it through And maybe I'm too good for you, oh  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong
She should make a cover album!
What a great voice!!!!!
I would like Miley to do some covers of Amy Winehouse! I miss Amy a lot, her talent and her voice and I think Miley is the only one who can do her justice!
Exigimos un dueto con Cher!
what here because its go. viral in tiktok¿.
Hannah Montana
I love it .
god i love her so much
I lover her version. I really feel that Miley Cyrus supports the LGBT COMMUNITY not in words but wholeheartedly.
Let's be honest this song suits her voice ♥️ and her life story 😅 For me this version is better than the original cuz Cher's has a lot of autotune. Cher's still iconic though 😁
We need a whole covers album and this better be one of the singles
Queria ouvir completo
Why am I crying? Whooooo Miley 🥰😔
🌹🌹🌹🌹🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊🎊👍👍👌👌👌😘😘💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Love you miley ❤️💕

Miley you’re the best
❤❤❤❤❤
Maravilhosa!!!
AS THE MAGIC GOES INTO THE AIR AND MAKES A CHANGE TO THE WORLD  WERE EVEN THE GODS  HAVE NOTICED ! 😎

I think there was a microphone issue here that is why she is holding a wired mic.. all singers are using wireless now.. she is so professional here and performed great..
cant get enough with this, it's amazing
I just found this video a few days ago and can’t stop viewing since. I am hooked by Myley’s stage presence and i have always loved her voice. She made this song her own.
Best performance in the industry...
I need this on Apple Music or Spotify 😌
Lo amare por siempre!!

No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside And I can't break through There's no talking to you So sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all is said and done You're gonna be the lonely one, oh Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now What am I supposed to do? Sit around and wait for you?

My heart
Hey Miley, we need this in Spotify.
prophet Muhammad Baca black stone prophet Abraham's wife Sarah, and about zam zam water in the bible ‎    ‎Jesus prophesied the coming prophet whose universal message will stay forever: ‎  ‎Jesus announces the coming of Muhammad (Gospel of Barnabas, chapter 112) ‎  ‎In chapter 163 ‎‎‎  ‎Jesus answer's with joy of heart: 'He is Mohammed, messenger of Allah, and when he cometh into the world, ‎  ‎In chapter 97:9-10 ‎  ‎Muhammad is mentioned by name referencing holiness of paradise. ‎  ‎Also in chapter 97 we read ‎  ‎Then said the priest: “How shall the Messiah be called?” “Muhammad is his blessed name”. ‎  ‎—Chapter 97:51 ‎  ‎The Name Muhammad is mentioned in several places like Chapters 44, 54, 112, 97 and 163. ‎  ‎and The Qur'an confirms the words of Jesus : ‎  ‎And when Jesus, the son of Mary, said: "O children of Israel! Behold, I am an apostle of God unto you, to confirm the truth of whatever there still remains of the Torah, and to give the glad tiding of an apostle who shall come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad." But when he came unto them with all evidence of the truth, they said: "This is spellbinding eloquence!" (6) surah As-Saff ‎    ‎those who shall follow the Apostle, the unlettered Prophet whom they shall find described in the Torah that is with them, and in the Gospel: who will enjoin upon them the doing of what is right and forbid them the doing of what is wrong, and make lawful to them the good things of life and forbid them the bad things, and lift from them their burdens and the shackles that were upon them . Those, therefore, who shall believe in him, and honour him, and succour him, and follow the light that has been bestowed from on high through him-it is they that shall attain to a happy state." (157) surah Al-A'raf ‎    ‎Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, "He who bears witness that there is no true god except Allah, alone having no partner with Him, that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger, that 'Isa (Jesus) is His slave and Messenger and he (Jesus) is His Word which He communicated to Maryam (Mary) and His spirit which He sent to her, that Jannah is true and Hell is true; Allah will make him enter Jannah accepting whatever deeds he accomplished".‎    ‎👉 Baca in the bible : Psalm 84 ‎      ‎4_Blessed are those who dwell in your house; ‎  ‎they are ever praising you. ‎  ‎5_Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them. ‎  ‎6_Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools. ‎  ‎ 7_They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God. ‎  ‎8 _O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. ‎  ‎Where this hous of God in valy of Baca ?? Which people travil to go there and pray To God ? ‎  ‎they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah ‎  ‎If you make search about Baca city .. It is the other name of( Macca ) in sudia Arabia ... And the hous of God there that every muslim should visit is is the( kapa ) the firat hous of God on earth ‎    ‎➡ Even black stone is mentioned in the Bible. ‎  ‎A. ". . .mine hause (mine refers to God) shall be called an hause of prayer for all people (congregational prayer as Muslims do today)". Isaiah 56:7. ‎  ‎B. " I will come into your house and worship in group (congregationally which only Muslims do this)". Psalm 5:7. ‎  ‎C. " It is written my house shall be house of prayer (Jesus is refering to Isaiah 56:7)". Matthew 21:12-13. ‎    ‎ BLACK STONE IN THE BIBLE. ‎  ‎A. Jacob set a stone (black stone) and called it HOUSE OF GOD. (Genesis 28:10-22). ‎    ‎B. God reminded Jacob about ‎    ‎➡ the black stone he set to be God's house (Genesis 35:1-3). ‎  ‎Jesus confirmed ‎    ‎➡ the Black stone in the book of Matthew ‎    ‎➡ 21:42-43. There are many places where black stone was set as house of God before the advent of Muhammad,and the Ka'a bah at Makkah is also mentioned in the Christian Bible but Christians were made to be Paul's followers they accept nothing only what their masters say. They do not reason for themselves. Those who reason convert to Islam at last. May Allah guide you my Christian friends to the truth,the light and the only key to salvation,ISLAM ‎    ‎👉 _The bible talks prophet Abraham's wife Sarah, and about zam zam water:- ‎    ‎➡ In the book of Genesis 16:7 it says, after mentioning the story of Ibraaheem (Abraham) going in unto Haajar (Hagar) and her becoming pregnant, then Sarai’s [Sarah’s] complaint to Ibraaheem about her: ‎    ‎➡ "And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain [spring] of water in the wilderness, by the fountain [spring] in the way to the Hijaz (Shur)." ‎    ‎"And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai." ‎    ‎"And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?" ‎    ‎"Wherefore the well was called Be’er lahai roi (Well of the Living One Who sees me); behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered." ‎    ‎See how the name of the Hijaz is mentioned, and Hajar’s departure to that place, after which the blessing of the “Well of the Living One Who sees me” is bestowed by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted; this is the Well of Zamzam. ‎      ‎👉 [An-Nisa' 116] ‎  ‎Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly gone far astray. ‎    ‎👉 [An-Nisa' 121] ‎  ‎The refuge of those will be Hell, and they will not find from it an escape.‎    ‎So please think about it again, ‎  ‎Our fate is the most important thing to mind. we are all dead, but our eternal life is what is our fate in it ?! ‎    ‎In this world we shall not be able to keep our finger close of fire. what about the hell ...it is very hard even to think about it. ‎    ‎ May God hasten guidance on the misled. Amen‎
😍💪🏽🇵🇦🕺
Não me canso de ver essa performance! 😍
This cover is like a gold <3
Maravilhosa eu te amo
When I feel like needing a quick dose of inspiration and courage, I watch this video
This performance is my favorite of all MILEY performances!!! She is a good loving soul!!!
One of my favorite song in this age… but Miley rocked it over 😍

Best pop singer alive. I'm not even a fan, i'm not even on the community, fanbase, i do'nt even listen Miley in a weekly basis, but: BEST. POP SINGER. ALIVE.
Acho que esse cover ficou bem melhor do que na voz da Cher 🙈🙊😝❤️
Esperando ansiosamente pela versão desta música disponível no Spotify.
This is everything too me ❤️

I love music more than voice
🌈❤️❤️❤️❤️🌈
😍😍😍😍😍 como no amarla
I can't take my eyes off of Kylie Sonique Love, she is so stunning
I'm a Millenium and I never gave her attention, she was a teen idol. But suddenly she started singing some good old songs and now I really appreciate her. Not because of the songs, but she's really talented.
Beautiful!:) Please we need a voice to help us to show the world Our people die   #SOSCuba, #HumanitarianInterventionCuba, #DictatorshipSellTheDonation
i know this song from  adam Lambert n now miley sing it. i love both of they
Miley eu te amo 😘 ( i 💕 you)
We need this concert available on Spotfy
Miley should be charged with “disseminating matter harmful to juveniles” she is guilty of that plenty of times that is known. Drake Bell is known to do it at least once and plead guilty, he may or may not face a prison sentence but he is accepting his mistake. Can Miley accept hers?
I love miley
Alove mirey cyrus good video❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👀👀
I adore.
Amoo aaa 🇧🇷
Miley really is the gift we did NOT deserve.
💜💜💜
Ela está fazendo trabalho musicais incríveis, muito bom

As a 32.male, you have really grown into a extremely talented vocalist and artist. I don't even like metallica, and your cover is awesome. Same with comfortably numb. Prisoner is a deadly good song. Comfortably numb!

Fun fact Cher hates Miley.

Marvellous Miley Cyrus,when you'll sing toghether Maneskin? I Hope sono.....
God bless you Miley!
I'm so torn. I love her music, but I can't stand her as a pathetic person. Damb, she's got one hell of a voice!
Miley Cyrus covering Cher’s believe while doing a hoedown with a bunch of drag queens. This. Is. Gay. Rights!!! I fucking liiiivvvvvveeeeeee!!!!
Miley  honey baby I a m n going to follow you until the in of time because I am really serious about you baby
I love Miley so much now matter how much people badmouth her. But I wish she'll remove those tattoos 😭
Masks in the audience 😂
Good voice. Sad for the topic.
Cade a música no Spotify?
The dancers are scary because the man is a man and the woman is a woman, and love is innocent of this
she's simply fabolous, its a great cover
Venite adoremus mine next song with this one.
Miley are you ever gonna dye your hair back to brown?
There's this one drag queen wnen I see Miley I see this Delano or something like that does somebody know her name!
❤️🥰
2:44 who’s the queen on the left? She kind of looks like Cherry Valentine from the UK
Why do I hear Miley so well on every style? She really got the best of all worlds🤪
COVER in Spotify pls 😭
perfeita, ja amava demais agora cantando nosso nossas musicas com pessoas da noite G LS Q I A +. MUITOOOOOOOO BOMMMMMMMM
Miley es mi religión
Go Miley !!
Incredíble ❤️❤️❤️
“Music, once admitted to the soul, becomes a sort of spirit, and never dies.”– Edward Bulwar Lytton
She can sing anything
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️✨
why did you keep apologizing to your fans for singing the cocteau twins' heaven or las vegas?  you should be apologizing to the cocteau twins for butchering their song and not giving the song the respect it deserved.
I don't know why but she sounds better than Cher autotune voice.. 😍
Culture vulture
I was trying to think who she reminds me of. Genesis P Orridge came close. God I hope Miley knows who that is.
Everybody's iconic, but Miley is a legend
all miley does is imitate other artists. Hope she finds herself one day
if this is what pride people look like its all makeup...I''ll try to judge on character and not sexual orientation or looks. But it seems their whole identity is looks and orientation...the dilemma
Лековит сум
Todos estamos de acuerdo de Miley es superior y lo será 📈✨🔥🔥
When she said "well hello mother!“ It feels like she‘s from the House of Evangelistas 😅♥️🥰
After love, after love After love, after love After love, after love  No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside And I can't break through There's no talking to you  So sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all is said and done You're gonna be the lonely one, oh  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now  What am I supposed to do? Sit around and wait for you? Well, I can't do that There's no turning back  I need time to move on I need love to feel strong 'Cause I've had time to think it through And maybe I'm too good for you, oh  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now  Well, I know that I'll get through this 'Cause I know that I am strong I don't need you anymore  Oh, I don't need you anymore I don't need you anymore No, I don't need you anymore  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now
2021. Who’s watching? 🤙🏻

MI LAY CYR USA
Amazing
Yo solo estoy acá para agradecerle al universo por permitirme nacer en la generación de la perfecta Miley!! Maldición sin ella no me interesa la música.
This is really fecking good 👍
QUEEN
I love Miley!!!!! 🥰
We should start an initiative for a new Live Aid 🎸 🎶 🎤 🤍
You should record a cover album with the greatest hits like this. In each song puts your essence 😀 heart of glass and believe was so amazing 👏
I love!!!!
La amo
💖💖💖💖💖💖
The queens, from left to right in 0:32, are:  Raquel Rea Heart @raquelreaheart Sapphire T. Mylan @sapphire_mylan Jaidynn Diore Fierce @jaidynnfierce Kylie Sonique love @xosonique Venus Ann Serena @venus_ann_serena Iris Le Fluer @iris_lefluer
Mashalah,Ilove taht  VOICE,and that Song😄😄😄
Thumbs downers get out!!!! You’re just jealous🤢
💘
Jesus still loves you...HE is the Lord...He is the Alpha and Omega...HE is the beginning and the end...He is the first and the last...He is the King of kings.. HE is Lord of lords...repent from alcahol, pornography and prostitution, drugs and a Man and a Women should do wedding (not fornication) and read the BIBLE and accept Jesus as your Lord and you will have eternal life...Jesus will come back soon, very soon,  maybe  2028, 2029, 2030,  2031, 2032, 2033 or 2034 according to 2 BIBLEVERSES : HOSEA 6.2 and 2 Peter 3.8 ...after two days he will revive us...1 day is like 1000 years...we think that Jesus had left this world in the year 30 or 31 or 32 or 33 (minimum 28 / maximum 36) and Jesus said, that he will come back as he left. We can calculate : 2 × 1000 + 30 or 31 or 32 or 33 = 2030 or 2031 or 2032 or 2033 (any year from 2028 to 2036 can be possible, 2036 should be the last possibility). Another very important message : the darkness is the last sign (Luke 21.25) before the arrival of our Lord Jesus on the clouds (Luke 21.27). After the arrival of Jesus on the clouds there will be the rapture (Luke 21.28). Are you ready for the Kingdom of Heaven? REPENT SO YOU WILL BE READY !!  Ezekiel 3,27 : but when I (God) speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, This is what the Sovereign LORD says : Whoever will listen let him listen, and Whoever will refuse let him refuse ; for they are a rebellious house....for more information read Ezekiel 3,18-32 and read the New Testament..Search God and he will open the door and  forget Dior...Fhhjjj
wow, shes damaged herself.

se me pone la piel de gallina al ver lo mucho que apoya a la comunidad miley, ella realmente es un solcito y merece todo lo mejor del mundo. no entiendo como hoy en día es de las artistas mas infravaloradas siendo que canta como ma put4 madre, es super buena siempre se preocupa de los demás y encima el encanto que tiene no lo tiene NADIE más. miley te amo me haces muy feliz gracias por acompañarme alrededor de todos estos años💫💕
Can someone pls put it on Spotify already?!?!? 😍😍😍😍
Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is near. Jesus is coming soon. The Bible says "...Today is the day of salvation." 2 Corinthians 6:2 If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10 : 9 Jesus shed His blood on the cross and died for the forgiveness of our sins. God raised Jesus from the dead three days later. Jesus is at the right had of God interceding for us. Romans 8 : 34
😍😍😍😍
❤❤❤
OMG!! GUUURL I’M LIVING! 😍😍

Not a Miley fan. No hate, just never got into her music. But I watched this and I loved it.

I wouldn't mind if she does a whole album of Cher's songs 👀
It's like song was written for her
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😍😍😍😍😍

As I wrote it already a lot of times : Miley can really sing everything.  This Cher cover (and I am a huge fan of Cher, saw her in September 2019 on her "here we go again tour") is very very good, but as already said, Miley can sing everything.  Great performance.
What a cover. Absolutely brilliant
Who is that transformer blonde?
Me hubiese encantado estar en ese show en primera fila..😍 Me encanta todo ese talento.
I wish i can be there. I wish i can live in another country like all of you. I wish i can show my Rainbow 🌈 too. But , i cant.  Anyway, love you all ... 💕❤🌈
Ficou perfeito esse chover de believe da Cher. Miley Cyrus é maravilhosa demais. Queria um dueto das duas.🙌🏻💙✨🌟⭐😍🥰❤️💜🌈🌈🌈
Perfeito esse cover da Cher. Miley sempre arrasa.
Eu chorando com essa performance misericórdia. 😭😭😭😭😭❤️
si la canción estuviera en Spotify tendría asegurado un top10 WW porque mis 3M de plays los tendría 😭😭🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Miley reminds me of Whitney when she performs live ! Very Great !
Amo os covers da Miley! Ela tá muito gata! 😍😍

Wow I have no words to say how proud I am of being me... Thanks to everyone who made this possible... Miley Cyrus you are amazing. We are proud of being us... 🤩🤩🤩
Gente, eu amei esse cover. Fiquei arrepiado aqui!
😍🏳️‍🌈💋❤️
I have loved this video as much as i loved the cover of "don't Dream Is over" with Ariana Grande.
Thank you for sharing this with us!!! I stopped listening to country music a few years back for political reasons. I thought all country music stars were die hard republicans, and I no longer aligned with those views. You showed me that's not true at all, and doing research online after seeing your special on peacock showed me further proof of how wrong I was. Apparently, the vast majority of country musicians are LGBTQ and BLM supporters. Color me pleasantly surprised! Thank you for opening my eyes and keep doing your thang!!!
I need this 😍
She's really amazing 😍
even before i clicked the video its like i could hear miley's voice on believe and sounding perfectly matched to her voice.
AME ESTA CANCIÓN  ..!!  GRACIAS POR EL APOYO A LA COMUNIDAD ERES UNICA
Miley is such a great entertainer
A legend singing the song of another legend. Queens shit🤘🏻💕💜🥰
I gay I proud
Miley has managed to carve a completely unique niche for herself. She is smashing it right out of the water! Fabulous talent. My two adult daughters and I all love her and can’t wait to share latest releases.
Miley super 😘
Miley hace those Samantha vibes💜🤩 #SATC
They should have autotuned her manly voice….

After love, after love After love, after love After love, after love No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside And I can't break through There's no talking to you So sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all is said and done You're gonna be the lonely one, oh Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now What am I supposed to do? Sit around and wait for you? Well, I can't do that There's no turning back I need time to move on I need love to feel strong 'Cause I've had time to think it through And maybe I'm too good for you, oh Do you believe in life…
Miley is so damn good. She's a living legend. It's only a matter of time before the Rock n Roll hall of fame comes a knockin'.
I loved this song by Cher and I’m a fan of Miley’s singing. She sings this great. I play this so much LOL
I love you 💗💗💞
2:22  Oh honey, I don’t need you anymore!
I luv Mileys new voice.
another classic butchered by miley...
Every time I heard something from Miley, I fell in love more and more. Such a talent, such a queen! 💖 Thanks for this performance,
Queen😫👏👏👏
Omg, is that Kylie Sonique Love over there?? YAAAS GIRL!
I wish you would come back to "The Voice" as a coach. You were an amazing coach!! You sound wonderful!! Best Wishes
Isn’t she the cutest person ever at 1:51 🥺
Tf her voice is just so gorgeous 🥺✨
Do the gays live for the electric slide?
🤍
I hope she performs this at her upcoming concerts!!😍😍 my favorite song covered by my favorite musical genius!
Meh
awful choreography lip singing and butt ugly singers including hannah montana 0/10
Miley estoy alucinada con tu música eres una súper estrella inigualable 😍😘🥰
Yeah babyy❤❤ freedom 👐👐
MARAVILHOSA 😍
Miley is the queen of covers! Has she ever done a cover that she doesn't nail? I just love each and every one... from "Why'd you always call me when you're high", to "No freedom", "Don't dream it's over", "Heart of Glass" and now "Believe". She just has a magic touch, stays respectful to the original artist but at the same time she makes it her own! Well done!
Esta mina es seca😀

I love u ❤️❤️❤️❤️🏳️‍🌈

In a moment of irreparable sadness I happened upon this beautiful video, you managed to make a smile come out of my heart, with even a few small tears. There is still so much hate and and so many wrong things in our society but there are also beautiful souls like you, who fight on the front line with a smile for others too. Thank you, from the deep of my heart.
it's the inclusivity for me 😍 she's so damn talented, and suuuuuch a good person. 🖤

I enjoyed this very much but It was missing the real char who I believe sung this in the late 1990s I think that it was who should have also been up there 👆🏻 with you singing with you Miley for sure dear 😉😍🎼🎵🕺🏻💃🏻
I love you Miley
Hay algo que esta mujer no haga bien?
Essa mina arraza !!! ❣🎵
Cher is the GOAT and will be so proud. I feel emotional
And everyone gave Miley shit years ago - look at this human being just doing what she wants and my goodness, how well thats going.
Miley vc é incrível, te amo muito! <3
God please save this people

Queen 💝🌈
🎥✔💯
I just love her to pieces
❤️L❤️O ❤️V ❤️E❤️
Essa drag loira parecia estar incomodada com a presença da miley
The masks 😔 in the audience...
The fact that they're wearing cher's most iconic outfits
I miss the voice ❤️
Chega a tremer o bico do peito *****************
When your parents are homophobic but you have Miley Cyrus 😍
We have an icon infront our eyes and were ignoren , how stupids we are. God!!
Soy yo???O Miley está un poquito más llenita, no estoy diciendo que esté gorda eh!!! Al contrario!!
QUEEN
I am very glad that Miley is singing this song. Now I am calm for her)  I was very worried about Miley's feelings. But now I'm sure she's ready to move on
Going to a Miley's concert with my best friend is definitely my biggest dream
Brasil 🇧🇷😚👏
I miss partying !!!!!
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤍🤎💖
I loved this song and Miley performance is amazing love her
a maior caras
I'm a believer. Tears are standing in my eyes each time I watch this.
Eu não sei, mas essa performance me deixa genuinamente emocionado, sinto uma vontade chorar. Ver todo mundo junto assim e pensar em um mundo sem mais descriminação, preconceito contra todos os membros da comunidade LGBTQIAP+… Além disso a voz da miley simplesmente toca a alma de todo mundo e a música Belive da Cher é um ícone para todos nós que acreditamos no direito de amor… eu choro mas não é de tristeza, eu choro de esperança e felicidade e de saber que todo nós podemos nos apoiar e lutar juntos a mesma batalha, e que tem pessoas enormes e incríveis com a gente… Hoje (dia desse comentário) e o dia internacional do orgulho, eu desejo muito amor, muita paz e felicidades para todos independente de quem sejam, eu vou orar ao universo pela nossa paz e para que sejamos super felizes, eu queria poder abraçar todos e sorrir pra transmitir um pouco da minha esperança pra vocês, mas deixo aqui todo o meu amor, saibam que mesmo não conhecendo vocês eu os amo é isso não é da boca pra fora, precisamos acreditar que o amor cura e não tenho medo de amar todos vocês, happy PRIDE ❤️🌈✨
Супер!!!
Showing appreciation for how Miles didn’t feel the need to hire the “trendiest” freshest faces of Drag and instead brought on with her seasoned Queens who SERVED the assignment
ICONIC ✨✨✨✨
Incredible how her voice fits in most of the hits she sings! Great singer and good attitude! One more on the iconic list! Well done Miley!
❤️💕

I never listened to "old" Miley, her voice didn't do it for me. But i absolutely love new Miley voice and her latest  album is a amamzing💜
No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside And I can't break through There's no talking to you  It's so sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all is said and done You're gonna be the lonely one  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me saying I really don't think you're strong enough, no Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough, no  What am I supposed to do? Sit around and wait for you? Well, I can't do that And there's no turning back  I need time to move on I need a love to feel strong 'Cause I've got time to think it through And maybe I'm too good for you  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me saying I really don't think you're strong enough, no Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough, no  Well, I know that I'll get through this 'Cause I know that I am strong I don't need you anymore I don't need you anymore I don't need you anymore No, I don't need you anymore  Do you believe in life after love?

I missed her dancing on stage and with drags it’s even better 🥺
Wait so the plastic hearts era isn’t over yet right ? Cause I love this era so much. I wonder what shell do next era now that she switched labels and is going to be much bigger cause RCA sabotages her. Like look at how good Columbia is already and she just switched a few months ago 😍🙌🏼
I've been watching this 5 times in a row now! Again, Miley surprised me with her versatile voice.. How spectacular everything is.. her voice, the performance, the energy and positive vibes she's oozing out and sharing to everyone.. so happy I've watched this..
Amazing 🥰

Miley is such an incredible and diverse singer, her deep tone and range makes her unique. She's performed some amazing renditions covering all kinds of genres showing off just how good her voice is . Like her or hate her the girl has a great voice, good to see her maturing away from the trashy antics

Soy el comentario en español que estabas buscando. Simplemente Miley es una Diva Total ♥️🌈🌈🌈

Diva completa, se destaca em qualquer estilo.
Perfeita miley
This is gay rights!
La número 1..

My babyyy🥰
Love it best regardes everyone from COSTA RICA   SALUDOS DESDE COSTA RICA   PURA VIDA 🇨🇷  🇨🇷  🇨🇷  🇨🇷  🇨🇷  🇨🇷
Cher must be so proud of this rendition!
She looks and sounds awesome!!! 😍❤❤
I’m not even a Miley Cyrus fan but she killed this song 🔥
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ela entregou tudo!
The gays complain that there is no versatility in the INDUSTRY but if you see how Miley has transcended her career beautifully, girl made Metallica and now has one, the industry doesn't value a great artist that miley Cyrus is like in the past, THE WOMAN IS ON THE SAME LEVEL AS LADY GAGA, TAYLOR SWIFT, BEYONCE, RIHANNA, ADELE and others (an artist that the people acclaim for his versatility), the greatest of his generation
Me impresiona está mujer cada vez más ❤️
Spotify???????????
Omg Cher is one of my idols and so is Miley and this is just amazing !!
She is a Barbie
Que energia incrívelllllll
HAPPY PRIDE EVERYBODY! 🌈🎉
Nobody is talking about QUEEN KYLIE IS NEXT TO HER!!!
❤️❤️❤️
This is original. Not. Step back for her IMO.
We need to see the rest of the performances please
Magic ✨🔥💅🏼🇦🇷
Super toll
Soy el único que piensa que Miley debería sacar un álbum con todos sus covers so far?
<3
We did not need this.
Miley Cyrus QUEEN ❤️👏😍
Yep. She has covers covered.
Nice😍😍😍
I loved ♥️💜 🌈
Living for the cover but where’s Chad Michaels?
Perfeita demais 😍
Can we all agree that we need Miley to do a album cover of only pop divas from back in the day
Sonique is GORGEOUS
🔥💞💞
I love you
"Hello Mother" 🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow  this is awesome❤️❤️❤️😱😱😱...
Amei essa música na voz dela.😍😍😍
Came here after seeing web headlines on how Milley blew the original away .... while a very well done cover .... does not quite have Cher's power or range.   Not like Id change the station if it came on the radio, less than a handful of today's singers could do as well as Miley did.
I don't feel guilty at all for liking this better with Miley more than Cher.

Amazing!!!!! Make it a single noww!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥💫💫💫
Miley you got such star quality honey and you know it 👍🏼
Omg 😍hermosas
Mrs Covers.  This woman make gold with every songs
I teared up a little bit with this.  A room full of individuality and acceptance. I can feel the love and happiness through the screen. In a time where a lot of us feel super alone and sad, Miley did a great job at bringing up the energy. Miley is a legend. Wish I could’ve gone!
Necessário
NO PUEDE SER AMIGA TE AMOOOOOO
La puta ama!
QUEEN🏳️‍🌈
Tô arrepiada
Miley, Gaga and Taylor are the most versatile artists of our generations.
#freebritney
Brasil ! 🙋
No shame or self respect. This is sad..
einfach nur großartig die Miley!
This is a very nice cover , you guys should listen to her comfortably numb  by Pink Floyd . I don't like the fact that Miley is always criticized for her behavior   because  in reality she is a performer and does not need others validation for her music just like any other famous artist that they are afraid to change to a different genre because they might lose "particular age group of fans" but Miley Cyrus can rock any genres. Gosh I have been listening to her since Hannah Montana till up now . She is a unique artist ❤
🥰♥️ Poweful🏳️‍🌈
Eu amo os covers da Miley
Miley you are so pretty
ok, iconic.
MILEY VC É TUDOOOOOO
My HANNAH MONTANA 😍
Yes, Miley, I'll marry you. Sheesh .....
I've just watched the show and I can't stop crying!! So beautiful songs that reminds me a lot of moments and stories that I have lived since I was a child and I came out. Thank you for this Miley! You're such an inspiration! Love you so much
Icónica mi Miley.
Miley rocks!
The amazing queen of music!
She’s so brilliant
If Cher and Dolly had a baby. 😍
Thank you Miley! We love you!
Miley can conquer the world if she wants to.

Representando Santa Cher

Miley 🌈🌈🌈 you are so  good!!! Please collaborate with Maneskin 😍😍😍😍
♥️
Great job at covering Cher song.
YEEEEES GOOOO QUEEEN
I knew you when you were Hannah, but I didn't think anything of you due to being in contract - trust, I've done extra work for 30 years - I know how it is, but when I saw your Wrecking Ball video, it changed my view of reality - how could this disney chick be the same girl, with this much feeling - with this much passion. I had forgotten that people aren't who they seem on tv and videos - I learned this years ago, but I had forgotten. Your passion and empathy, along with your sense of humor gave me hope for a better future. Your attitude is like mine. You were part of the reason I stood up for myself and the town of LAUGHLIN this past month - You've always been a great inspiration to me because you are always you, no matter who doesn't like it or not. TRUE HUMAN!! If we had people like you in our government, we would be in Paradise. I'm tryin to change that. Check out my facebook and you'll see how you inspired me to take on a town. It's under Bradley Beck, University of Wyoming and Arcadia, the town I grew up in. Peace, beautiful soul.
I love you
I like her version of this song.
uma das melhores versões, EM ANOS. TE AMO, MILEY. ❤
She has the talent and she doesn’t need to bring it all it’s doing great without doing a lot
“Hello mother” 🤣🤣♥️
Quá hay, quá tuyệt vời, từ khi nghe Cô Ca Sỹ Cher hát đến giờ cũng hơn 20 năm, đây là lần đầu sau rất lâu rồi nghe Miley Cyrus hát quá hay.
When u didnt know this existed until tiktok showed u an ad and now ur hooked to this
We love you Miley!!!!!!!! 🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
💙♥️😍🧡💛💚🤎💜🤍
Oh god, this is fucking incredible.
Hi miley i really like your cover muah muah🤣😘😘😘😘

Miley + Cher’s Drag Queens = everything
There are now two people who can do a cover of this song. Miley, obviously, and if you haven't seen Adam Lambert at the Kennedy Center Honors, check it out. It brought Cher to tears.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
A diversidade existe e precisa ser respeitada!! 🌈❤️
Que bellas todas las queens que la acompañan 😍
Yes 😁
Ameeeei 😍💃🏻🇧🇷
Best singer ever
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love that Miley can do a cover and make it her own.  She is a real talent and wish she was given more credit for the talent.

Don't call it a come back!! I never left!!
LYRICS: After love, after love After love, after love After love, after love No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside And I can't break through There's no talking to you So sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all is said and done You're gonna be the lonely one, oh Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now What am I supposed to do? Sit around and wait for you? Well, I can't do that There's no turning back I need time to move on I need love to feel strong 'Cause I've had time to think it through And maybe I'm too good for you, oh Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Well, I know that I'll get through this 'Cause I know that I am strong I don't need you anymore Oh, I don't need you anymore I don't need you anymore No, I don't need you anymore Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now

Se ha convertido en una leyenda y todavía no tiene ni 30 años, menuda JOYA de mujer 😍🔥
Шикарно 😍♥️
for a long time i wasn’t a fan of miley, and it wasn’t until recently that i became a fan. and it’s honestly because she looks so much happier than she used to and seems like she is making the music she wants, and doing what she wants to do.
No one is going to talk about her abs?
This gives me chills, imagine being at that concert!! 🥺❤️
Some people sing for glory, prestige or art, but Miley sings for herself and for people <3
THIS WOMAN IS INSANEEE!! DAYYUUMM! 😱♥️
Guys I need to watch this concert but peacock isn’t available on my region. What can I do?? Pls help 🥺💗

Yassssss... Mama
No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside And I can't break through There's no talking to you It's so sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all is said and done You're gonna be the lonely one Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me saying I really don't think you're strong enough, no Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough, no  What am I supposed to do? Sit around and wait for you? Well, I can't do that And there's no turning back I need time to move on I need a love to feel strong 'Cause I've got time to think it through And maybe I'm too good for you Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me saying I really don't think you're strong enough, no Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough, no Well, I know that I'll get through this 'Cause I know that I am strong I don't need you anymore I don't need you anymore I don't need you anymore No, I don't need you anymore  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me saying I really don't think you're strong enough, no Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough, no Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough, no Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me saying I really don't think you're strong enough, no

I remember singing Miley with my friends back when i was just a little boy trying to figure out things in a straight world. Now it's been 13 years, and see Miley being a queer icon, singin in a stage with drags to celebrete fight and love it gets me so emocional, I feel like we grown together. Thank u Miley! Thank u so much for being this POWER and givin us voice! We love you! HAPPY PRIDE EVERYBODY!
Always killing it !! God what a person . Miley just so good

You know, I've come to really respect her voice. It's unique and really good.  It's too bad that her "public" persona has turned me off so much I want nothing to do with her.
I’ve never been more proud to have named my daughter after such an incredible woman ❤️
Te amo hermosa
THIS PERFORMANCE IS SO POWERFUL WOW 💕💕❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥😝😝
Preciosa Miley ella es una estrella increíblemente brillante
A pile of populist commercial shit.
Sonique, my all stars 6 winner
❤️
I didn’t think I needed this cover in my life….
Pls, put this on Spotify, I beg you 😭😻
I know this is unrelated to the video but Iam on a mission to spread the gosple of Jesus Christ. (Mark 16:5),  And he said to them, “Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation.  We are all sinners who have broken the law of God. No good deeds or moral actions could ever make you right with God. For God says "our righteous acts are like filthy rags" before him. (Isa 64:6). But God came down to earth in the man Jesus Christ. He fulfilled the law of God perfectly and laid down his life for you as a perfect sacrifice. Then 3 days later rose from the dead and now reigns forever. If you put your trust in Jesus that through his death and resurection, you can be saved from the wrath of God. He will clense you of all your sins and you can be in right standing with God. Not because of anything you have done, but as a free gift.   Isaiah 53:6 says "We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.  “Turn to Me and be saved, all you ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.” Isaiah 45:22
Amoooooooooo
Inexplicable el amor que te tengo, automáticamente con sólo verla antes de qué empiece a cantar se me pone la piel de gallina 🥺💖💖💖
Wooo...I saw you grow up and I can't be more proud, my Reyna you are a complete artist. I love you.

Why every cover she does is even better than the original? Love you so much, Miley <3
this moved me,, the way she sang that last part, wow!! HAPPY PRIDE MONTH Y’ALL 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
I've followed Miley from the beginning. She has grown Soo much. I love that she can do any song and it's perfect like it's an original. She's a legend. Liam is missing out. He should of stood by her. She's shining bright. #concertbucketlist
When she sang “I don’t need you anymore” I seriously felt that
♥️
I love you
Miley live fu*king great
Need more auto tune for this like original sounds  :v
Dona da minha vida. 👑❤️‍🔥
She does not sing this well, doesn't look very pretty and yet I love her. That's a star!
OK Kylie and Jaiden <3
of course me, plays this way to many times. ❤️ #rockstar
kylie sonique love looks gr8 wowowow
she looks so cute omgg
wish I was there
Good rendition of Believe, but trashy video.
love her but hate that hair.  It's giving me ugly part of the 80s vibes.  It's almost a girly mullet.  Please no.
Dude this song fit her so well!? How is she so good at so many genres
Dear Miley....   As  43 year old.... In my day we didn't have nearly the support the kids of today have... Definitely not from the big celebrities of the world... Not in the same way... Because they also didn't have the support of today...  When I was 18 there wasn't PRIDE in my city.... Now PRIDE is the second largest annual event here and our queer community is strong, vibrant, visible, and active.... We have come a long way... We still have a long way to go...  What you are doing for the queer youth of the world is beyond amazing.... This is how you love.... I truly, truly thank you for being a voice and a support for our queer communities.... You do more then your could ever fathom.... Thank you....
Full of surprises. Can't believe this girl! ❤️
Just wooooooow
We love u Miley!!! 🇵🇭
HAPPY PRIDE EVERYBODY 🏳️‍🌈 Hugs from Brazil 🇧🇷 Miley i Love you  🥰👏🏾💋❣
Happy Pride all you beauty's!   🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤍🤎🖤🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈
WOW! Cher really never ages !!!
That was like listening to a cat die.
She sounded amazing and it was such a nice performance!
What an incredible performance. Mileys talent is endless! ❤️
I am 61years old and enjoy Miley's covers. I love her voice.
Fico vindo assistir isso de meia em meia hora tá bom demais, miley vc é perfeita em tudo q se propõe a fazer, mulher te amo muito ❤️
Acá los comentarios en Español. Te amo Miley ♥️
Deusas ❤️❤️❤️❤️
😍😍😍😍😍😍
I needed this
I never like this song...now i love it❤❤❤
I don’t know her personally but I feel so proud of her! She’s a amazing at all she does.
Can anyone name a genre Miley can’t deliver? Whether you like her or not, she’s the definition of talent.
Can someone confirm if they are indeed Latrice Royale and Kylie Sonique Love?
This is what it looks like when you rediscover yourself and stay true to that.  This is what it looks like when you don't follow everyone else and thrive from what's on the inside  Miley is a legend. There is no one thriving like her right now. This is her time.
My eggs
IM SO HAPPY TO SEE JAIDYN

I LOVE YOU MILEY!!! 🏳️‍🌈

After love, after love After love, after love After love, after love No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside And I can't break through There's no talking to you So sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all is said and done You're gonna be the lonely one, oh Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now What am I supposed to do? Sit around and wait for you? Well, I can't do that There's no turning back I need time to move on I need love to feel strong 'Cause I've had time to think it through And maybe I'm too good for you, oh Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Well, I know that I'll get through this 'Cause I know that I am strong I don't need you anymore Oh, I don't need you anymore I don't need you anymore No, I don't need you anymore Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough now

Já quero no Spotify
Te amamos demasiado Miley <3
We love you so much Miley <3
UN-STANKIN-REAL ‼️‼️‼️‼️
The small steps i really love it
Bravo! In a round about way a lovely tribute to CHER while making CHER's biggest hit her own. A lot of electronics were used with CHER in the recording studio when this song was originally done. I was shocked it became the world wide hit that it became. CHER has recorded much better songs that went nowhere on the charts. This to me was a light weight song but a hit is a hit and CHER enjoyed a huge comeback with this song. I hope whatever this cover was meant to do succeeds.
Which planet is this?
Yeahhh miley 🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
Esta perrisima 😊❤️😍
you are so amazing and talented! sonique looks so good amg
OMG, beautiful!❤️
Happy pride y’all 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️

Beautiful good
Thank you so much Miley ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Miley Cyrus just trashed a Pride anthem as well as an Iconic classic by Cher! Like shame on you. Stop living off Dolly’s and other celebrities came to stay famous. Make your own path to stardom. The only positive point of this video is that the Queens are gorgeous and talented!!!

"Believe" reminds me so much of a time when the world was all right for me. Always heard the song on the radio back then. It was also shown on German television on special occasions. I got goosebumps hearing that song from you just now, Miley. Life is not easy for all of us right now. But you let it all be forgotten and for a moment I feel free and good. Thanks for everything Miley, you make this world more beautiful and better. I send you many greetings from Germany and all the best 👍🏻💪🏻😊❤️💛💚💜🐶🍀🌈
Love u Miley ❤❤❤❤❤ Happy Pride
fireeeeeeee
YES, PERFORM, QUEEN!
I would do anything to be there
We couldn't get Cher?

#cheriscryingrightnow  I am sure Cher is blown away by this performance!!!
Queen of new versions of these classics. ✨❤️
"talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it."
LOOOOOOVES IT!
Not a big fan of her or her music but I respect the shit out of this woman for being very vocal about where she stands ✊🏳️‍🌈 I could see her being a strong human rights activist when she gets a little older.
Awesome! 😎🤩
ICONIC.
Why is she so incredible?
I was waiting for Cher to come out! 🤣

Miley is one versatile performer.  A real pro, and still a young person.  I wonder if she could cover "No Time" by The Guess Who?  But the harmonies might be a problem.
Es hermoso
Essa performance ficou perfeitaaa ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
Oh baby, you don't know how I love you.
💃💃
Versatility doesn't even begin to explain this queen! She releases a cover of a Metallica song one day and a cover of a Cher song the next day. Miley is the queen!!! Bow down!

Arrasou maravilhosa
LETS SING 🎤   No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside And I can't break through There's no talking to you It's so sad that you're leaving It takes time to believe it But after all is said and done You're gonna be the lonely one  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough  What am I supposed to do Sit around and wait for you Well I can't do that And there's no turning back I need time to move on I need a love to feel strong 'Cause I've got time to think it through And maybe I'm too good for you  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough   Well I know that I'll get through this 'Cause I know that I am strong I don't need you anymore I don't need you anymore I don't need you anymore No I don't need you anymore  Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me say I really don't think you're strong enough
