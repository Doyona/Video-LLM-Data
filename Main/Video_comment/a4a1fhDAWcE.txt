His smile makes me smile
al did not not look 62 in this. no way in hell.
Al, I love you just as much today as I did when I drove my school bus insane by playing "Another One Rides The Bus" and singing along.
Hey I live there!!!
Weird al NO
At least the orders were nice this time.
Hi @alyankovic! I’m doing a school project where I have to write about a musician! I was wondering if I have permission to call you Al?
Джигурда 2
Once the Grays and whites grow in he'll look exactly like Billy Connolly
Bloody genius mind lmao
I can't wait for his new music in the future. It's going to be wild!!!
Bud I am am so flabbergasted I am absolutely astonished I am speechless at how amazingly hilarious this is no cap the best joke ever ahahahahaha ( that wasn’t sarcasm this is actually hilarious )
Literally my celebrity crush
Who's this Alyan Kovic  guy, anyway? He looks familiar.
Imagine just walking down the street and you spot Weird Al recording a weird video.
Why does it say wave?
Timeless classics by this guy
You still make me smile Al.
Wait. Did the sign say _Look Crazed, Neurotic, and Confused...?!_
Hey, it's Artificial Intelligence Yankovic!
No it's telling you to stop people who look and wave. You need to stop that guy now!
*I **_love_** and honestly **_admire_** this guy’s view on life. Perspective, balance ⚖️, enJOYment….He’s really got this thing figured out.* 💯   I’m only periodically graced with your presence, so it’s nice that this appeared on my homepage. Love to you, Al, from an 80’s kid who’s always adored you. (“Eat It” parody introduced us in my Jackson -obsessed- -enamored youth.) 🥰
My scrotum
If you don’t adore Weird Al, you’re a sad person.   He’s made millions of people smile and laugh.   We should all be this good.
My favorite Weird Al skit was the Mentos one but I can't find it anywhere anymore.
That defense doesn't hold up Al, they had a trial about that
the thumbnail made you look like Gallagher.
The older he gets the more he looks like Robert Plant. Time for another parody song!
LOL! Sweet  Weird Al is always hilarious 😂
great minds think alike??? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxBe0RW9r9k
Gotta love this guy
Weird Al is one of those dudes who is sort of looking cooler the older he gets
Whose order.. ROFL I don't give a shit.. When time. Comes.. It will. Be my hammer... ROFL🤣🤣 okay.. ROFL🤣🤣
What does stop look wave even mean? Other than exactly that 😂
weird al is the only celebrity that can randomly shitpost on his youtube channel and everyone loves it
go ephs!
I must be getting old because i thought this was Billy Connolly
Sign said nothing about smiling
How can a man be almost 65 and still look like in his mid 40s naturally? I mean Weird Al is something special so that might answer it 🤣
National Treasure right here
That’s Weird Al?  Omg he looks amazing.  He looks like Robert Plant a few years ago.  Super Handsome!  ❤
This happened at my school!! Williams College, his daughter goes here and is in my year
This just made my Night and day.
This man has been making me laugh since before I was in junior high. Thank you Al
😂😂😂😂😂
Weird Al was 62 years old when he uploaded this vid, and he has got GREAT HAIR for a 62 year old.
Another comedic statement of the governMENTAL stupidity all around us! Thanks Mr. Yankovik!
..... isn't that Abbey Road?
Al!  We still need you!
can we do more kazoo?
Love weird Al.
LEGEND.
What a majestic mane!
Whoa, you can kinda see that same sign at the beginning of the video if you look closely. Brilliant foreshadowing.
Christ he looks like John Cleese... with long hair
Please God let Weird Al live forever
64 going on 24
Is that Virginia Tech?
Weird Al is a national treasure
Good soldiers follow orders
I've never seen a crossing like that, what does the "wave" part actually mean?
A Pinkie Pie husband moment
Who’s this Alyan Kovic guy?
hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
That's just funny, nothing else to say.
😂
Execute Order 66
Do you know who else was “just following orders”?
He's a legend! 🤣💕
He’s so precious 😂
Al is a genuinely good soul, just like Fred Rogers. :)
Weird Al has to be one of the squarest, uncoolest dudes ever and goddamn does he deliver the goods.
Weird Al has been doing ridiculous shit longer than most of us have been alive.
I love this man.
That’s what they said at Nurenberg!
when the biochip the CIA planted in my brain activates:
This is gold. Thank weird al for this I smiled on a bad day
Caroline Collingwood would have something to say about this.
Billy Connolly?
how does he look wat better now than his younger days?
I can't believe he actually did it, the absolute madman
WOW
Remember kids, big brother doesn't want you to think for yourself...
Damn i thought a holocaust was coming
"Any last words before your execution, Alternate Reality Fascist Weird Al?"  "I was just following orders!"
Slow down. Glance. Head nod.
God bless
Man, Billy Connolly is funny even to this day
"Or so the Germans would have you believe..."
Ok but what does the wave mean ?? Stop, I get it. Look, I get it.  But why wave ???
Was he doing a Joe Biden impression, 9.5. Going by the title, and content. 😂
0:07 got me. The look on his face was so genuine.
Newer generation must be wondering why his name is Weird A.I.
Lol what?
This man is an imposter. The real Weird Al was assassinated in 1985!
I thought it was Eric Idle for a moment.
I needed this. ❤
I feel like the title was simultaneous clickbait and 100% accurate.  Bravo, Weird Al!
Billy Connelly gets it
I love this man with all my heart, him and Robin Williams were my childhood icons.
Intrusive thought moment.
😊
Omg Cheese Sammich! Hi!!!
LIVE. LOVE. LAUGH. STOP. LOOK. WAVE. ...
The best content is no content. Keep it up Al!
I hope he’s not in Germany when he’s just following orders. The locals might get offended
is that... cheese sandwich??
i still giggle when i think of THE ORB! ooOoOOooOOoo!
Something inherently ironic about a jew saying he's just following orders
Good soldiers follow orders.
And this is how i found out Al has a youtube channel : ) - Subbed ! - been a fan since  the day you made your first appearance on Doctor demento playing My Balogna.
Al is prob the nicest guy
Gotta love weird Al
Waow he finally aged
Weird al is starting to look like John Cleese with a wig
That's very funny. I like this. Thank you
Still staring at the orange juice?
great facial expresions and humor, this guy should get into comedic music, he would probably like it /j
the stiffness of his halt, the utter urgency and panic of his look, to all be wrapped up in a beautiful smile and wave. this; this is art
This man makes me even prouder to be a Washitonian!
This never gets old
Okay, but what did the sign mean anyway? Like, I get the "stop" and "look," but what is the waving for?
Sleeper agent activated
Good soldiers follow orders
so preshish ❤
That jumpscare tho
You such a treasure, dude
Al is a gentleman, a scholar, with the soul of a poet and the brain of a small boy he keeps on his desk. (Apologies to Stephen King for stealing one of his jokes--I tweaked it though, so it's not plagiarism, I swear.  ...long pause...  It may be a word crime though.)
That's what the Nuremberg trails said to the chicken.
🛑
It's Old Mankovic
Good soldiers follow orders
Good soldiers follow orders
what was he looking for though
Never change please.
fr
good job bud woulda done the sameee
what does "stop look wave" even mean
What is "stop look wave" supposed to actually mean?
Everyone loves this guy and so do i
I thought this was a dark video referencing the Nuremberg trials.
"We we're just following orders! 😭"
man this guy sure is weird..
Good Soldiers Follow Orders
If I could choose one celebrity to meet, it'd be this guy, or Jim Carrey. Love em both.
I wonder if Nostalgia Critic takes Notes from AL 😅
This man is a national treasure.
Daniel Radcliffe did a great job looking exactly like you in the 80s man!
I think it’s so funny that he’s like this irl not just in his music 😂
Why do you have to wave??
Are you ever not clever?! Weird Al's literal shit must also be profoundly, brilliantly sarcastic. ❤  The line "Oh yeah, And if you ever wake up one day and find yourself in an existential quandry, full of loathing and self-doubt and wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful, meaningless existince, at least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that somewhere out there, in this crazy, old, mixed-up universe of ours, there's still a little place...called Albuquerque." just hits different from when I first heard it as a child 24 years ago.
Okay that's weird....
Weird Al is looking more like Billy Connolly with every passing minute
Never stop being weird Al.
It said stop look wave so he stop look wave
I thought this was gonna be an announcement of some kind
Speer in the Nüremberg trials be like:
How the hell does this only have 10 likes? YouTube is broken
COMEDY GOLD!!
When an NPC starts to interact :
its a weird timeline when Weird Al in his 60s is morphing into Russell Brand...
You have very pretty hair, sir.
If they ever made about movie about the fake life of John Cleese, Weird Al has the part in the bag.
Heh
Boy are we lucky it said something harmless.
This guy was doing Youtube humor in the 1980's.
cringiest thing ive seen on youtube
2 years later, still funny
Wait... wave? Why do they tell you to wave? At whom? Drivers? Isn't that just distracting?
This man is a national treasure.
https://youtu.be/BqD2KF5Bg7k?si=rvI9AP6lHngSzhzR
“Good soldiers… follow orders”
R.I.P.
At ease corporal 🫡
This guy is so charming
God, I love Weird Al's sense of humor!!!
My friend said that out of all the celebrities that have stayed at the hotel that he worked, Weird Al was the absolute worst. He was rude to all the staff and made outrageous requests, of which he acted like a child when they couldn't be fulfilled. He has an aura of invincibility about him but he's actually not a great person to work with or be around. A real piece of shit when it comes to actually being around him.
Good soldiers follow orders.
The intrusive thoughts won
First
Id do the same thing
Dude saw 14,000,606 possibilities.
What would of been funnier, if he stop, look, wave on the one behind him, so he is in the middle of the street...but since this is an impromptu (no permit), its fine. Might be breaking some laws...and bones, if he went the other angle.
Is he in front of Northwestern?
Just following orders is something a nazi would say at Nuremburg
I was wondering who Alan Kovic is
ah, you...
This man is a goofy goober. A silly billy even.
Is that Abbey road??
This man is a national treasure!
Does that also involve the vaccine?
Is this Abbey Road?
Weird Al or Weird AI ?
I dunno, he smiled tho. Lol
Ooh there's weird Al. I wondered where he was
This man was built for the internet 30 years before it was a thing
The original shitposter <3 long live Weird Al!   "Virrrus alert! Delete immediately before someone gets hurt! Forward this message on to everybody"  Grew up on that lmao
Abbey road?
I wish he was my uncle
“He who does not love Weird Al does not love life” - Homer Simpson
Good soldiers follow orders
Al may be weird, but he follows instructions like a good citizen!
What are actually supposed to do? Why would you wave?
Who is this Look Wave we have to stop?
me when i'm looking
AL will be 100 years old and still be AL. He won’t have to work anymore, but he may do it just to keep from being bored.

This is a crime against humanity.

What did this get green-screened in?
Here at 1,880,336 views.
This dude's weird.
It’s totally beyond me why Al doesn’t have at least a weekly YouTube show. Short sketches, mini-parodies, music, interviews, movie reviews, world news…   I dunno… maybe I’m asking too much of the guy. 🫤
His hair is glorious
Nuremberg reference
Way to go Al! Still carrying that Mandatory Fun spirit with you while navigating the pandemic. You are the light of the world.  I wish you and your family prosperous, long lives, Trip Seibold (Robert III)
its like when you see someone jogging with a reflective belt on and you're wondering how late you are to PT and its been (x) years
He who is tired of Weird Al, is tired of life.   -Homer Simpson
Você se parece com o meu cunhado Simom o Inglês. LolLolLol!
That’s actually quite nice of him to do so.  Thank you for posting.
I thought it was just gonna be stop and he was gonna be stuck there and then it’d cut to just his shoes and a pile of bones still there
Coming back after a year and months past He still follows the rules very greatly!
Good soldiers follow orders
Where was this filmed?
Bro got his first sight of gray on hair.
Al was such a boss the chicks lined up at his trailer back in the day... Top that!   Oh, how do I know? An old friend of mine (RIP) told me how his mother and her friends would be right there with rest back then. She didn’t deny it! Lol  These ppl were crazy as hell, but they didn’t lie! 😂
Weird Al has been meme-ing before memes were even a thing
I can't believe the same person who made Word Crimes isn't saying anything about how there should be commas in that sentence...
This man must be protected at all costs
oh al u crazy
He looks almost like Billy Connelly.
I love Al lmao
Crosswalk actually says "Wave" 😂😂
Your talent is always appreciated Al! Your Roku film was hilarious. It's incredible you survived such insanity! I never knew you had such a dangerous past! Well we're just glad you made it, Al. I just want you to know I think it was extremely RUDE of Michael J to steal your song and original melodies like that! I hope he least paid you royalties. Man.... some people. Geez... Anytime you feel like doing another release, we'll be here to appreciate it. I saw Word Crimes for the first time the other night- it was absolutely brilliant. Cleverness was off the charts. Kudos to the animator too. Talk about a power couple. Now I'm always gonna have random sights of dancing punctuation marks floating around in my head for the rest of my life. 😆
I mean those are the instructions! Otherwise the crosswalk zaps you into dust. It's in the rules!
Dang, he looks like Eric Idle and Gallagher here for a moment LOL
love how this guy has such an extensive discography and made at least several movie cameos and has the irrevocable power to walk onto TV at will yet he's here casually dropping random videos with the kind of humor we crave XD
Al, you're absolutely WONDERFUL.  Thank you for being a National Treasure!  Keep at it!  We love you! :)
I love you Al ❤️
Awww he’s so cute!!!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THat is so freaking funny!
al is an absolute legend

this was such a late reaction laugh but I heaved at this. he could totally pass for someone's physics professor
Imagine if this guy was born in 1999 instead of 1959.
If you and Billy Connolly ever get together please... PLEASE for the love of GOD record the conversation and share it with us all. You're both growing into lovely old shitposty elves and I'm here for it!
You're very obedient
Founding father of internet culture!
Lol, awesome
Too cool!!! Good fun and crazy dude!! 😂😃
You got it.
Looking good for a man his age.
This dude is in his 60s and he's still does stuff like this? Hell yeah, I'll have what he's having.
"He who is tired of Weird Al, is tired of life." - Homer Simpson
Absolutely fantastic! Never gets old 🤔
Weird Al shall never die!
Absolute legend.
You look like John Cleese. Lol
There will never be another Weird Al, a true one of a kind
You mentalist 🤣
You look great al
smash a watermelon with a giant hammer.
He looks like a friendly squirrel, a startled one but friendly nonetheless. The man's a treasure. Even in a shitpost, this guy never fails to amuse.
Just like his music, he can somehow parody shitposts and make the genre better
this man, rick may and jack black are my heros
This is funny, I like this
I want to see this dude bring back the Fro
"I hate these           WORD CRIIIIIMES"
I love Al so much!
I was here
Thank God, a non #shorts short
You are such a good teacher. 27

So weird
why does that look like my old Campus in NYC? XD
I think Weird Al could take most rappers in a rap battle, Round 2 king right here
Imagine having a beer with this guy
Weirdo        And we wouldn't have it any other way.
God was drinking gfuel when he made weird al
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCeTOtHPOw0&t=394
I haven't gone through all of the comments but I'm curious. Where was this filmed? I'm guessing outside Vassar college?
Uncle al how you been
It's fitting Weird Al looks like that really cool professor we had in college.
Good soldiers follow order
You guys are good, real good.
shit FRANK ZAPPA Walking!!
This is the chaotic good we all need.
This man literally never ages!
im glad you have dispelled the "Bald" myth.
Please never stop being you, Al! You're an inspiration to just be oneself no matter what!
This made me realize that if i saw him in the street, i probably wouldnt recognize him
....been sharing your vids with people who need a laugh more than anything else....& one said to me..."what is this?..he's got crazy eyes"....i said..Look Again..that's the Light of Genius, Unbridled. Play it!.......we Love You, Al!  & we Need you Now more than ever, & you knew that didn't you.....Your Genius is Our Oxygen
this is my favorite song writer/singer. best comedian in my opinion,and,another one rode the bus because he san about it.he is a legend.
Haahaha How does Billy Connolly get to look so much like him?
Been a fan a long, long time.  I’ve always loved your sense of humour.
This man has aged like Keanu Reeves
🤣 he indeed did just followed the orders
Weird Al got a tummy now lol
wow
What a nice video.
Good soldiers follow orders...
I have to confess, when someone stops to let me cross the street, I wave and smile at them, now.
Literally 1984
Keanu and Al really don't age that much.
Weird Al....!! I love em.
You're starting to look like John Cleese.
God bless y’all!
Good soldiers follow orders.
Weird Al is a LEGEND...!
I wanna meet you and give you a hug so much
i saw weird al play a free show at a fair in nampa idaho like 7 years ago. you only had to pay to get into the fair. ive seen many live acts and his show was by far one of the most entertaining ive ever seen. and everyone in his band are masters at their craft. ive been a fan for over twenty years. it's good to see he's still doing funny shit.
I don't know why I laughed so hard at this.
🖐✌❤🤙
Still got it
God bless you!
This is the kind of content I signed up for
Why haven't I been sub'd since day one.  WTF YouTube of course I want to see this guy daily!!!  Me love some weird Al
I love this man to the deepest bit of my core
Um
Youth is fleeting, life only temporary, but the Weirdness is forever
Good soldiers follow orders
🤣🤣🤣
Can't help but to assume this is a dig at all the people just happily complying with dumb mandates worldwide...
We need more weird al please!
Yes you are!
I want cheese sandwich back
Still love Weird Al. Brilliant man.
the fact that this was filmed in williamstown...iconic
Lol this dude has been a favorite of mine since in 3-D ✌️
Love it
Hi. Love you! 🙏❤ to you and your loved ones. Happy Holidays !
Finally my YouTube algorithm got it right!!
I'm feeling down and this appeared. Thank you God for bringing Weird Al to me. My spirit is now lifted!
For a second there, I thought Al was Billy Conolly.
Lol wow time flew !
I love this!
Yozba hubbah bay bay joobles...
He's an old, fat, grandpa man lol I love Weird Al
So Good To See You Al.
Take care of yourself Al, the dark forces know that the truth of comedy can unite the people they wish to keep divided. Sleep with one eye open.
hes kinda starting to look like count dooku a bit, full honesty.
This man needs to be immortalized !!! 😂😂😂
He lives!
From his first appearance on Dr. Demento to this day, Weird Al is a legend.
Weird Al? 😂. Long time no see.
I'm am SSSOOOOOOO proud of you young man, following orders so well. Here's your participation trophy !
Weird Al has not aged a minute in a minute.. wtf?
Still one of my favorite people.
Thank you for making me smile!! I really appreciate everything you do.
Unrelated but have you ever considered trying to make music with BELA FLECK? He's really good at the banjo, and ur really good at accordion. I've never heard that combo, and it definitely seems weird, soooooo.... Maybe get Les Claypool on the standup bass?
😂😂😂
Gotta love it!!!!,
Hah
lol what the fuck, Al... you're batshit nuts.  Thank you.  You made it easier for me to just do whatever.
Not so sure about this being a shit post unless you want to make fun of a practice that could save your life as a pedestrian.
Speaks for itself lol
The goat
Silly goose! 😊
This is probably 15 minutes for my town you're the best 1 live in north adams MA
Lol I love you weird al. Have for 20 something years, at any rate.
Weird Al is like a vitamin, especially these days. When life looks overwhelming, watch him do anything and your humanity gets a breath of fresh air.
Weird Al now looms like so many university profs I've met.
Man, God bless you, Tiny Tim. I can recognize you everywhere.
Gold! 👍
Haha LOVE him 😊💕
I can’t remember what I had for breakfast but I remember every lyric to “Fat”
🖐👀🖐
Peak YouTube content.
Haha, love that same wave he does in the "White and Nerdy" video.
your a Total Mad lad Al. Please never change <3
Robert Plant's brother?
You've aged well you awesome fuck! I miss your great parodies sir. Get back to making fun of the world please. At least pop culture.
He like john cleese
Weird Al love you man watched you in your movie and on MTV you made being very young very good times while having very dole moments!
Straight Outta City 17 - Half Life 2 reference
That guy is weird.
word al yankovic
😂😂😂👍
Good boy. 10 social credit points for you.
Al looks like he's gonna play Billy Connolly in a biopic that wants people to think Billy Connolly is a silver fox
There could never be another one of this beast. He's the goat by default.
Only you... the weirdest of the odd, I give you a nod, and smile and chuckle at your shenanigans, coming back, time and time again. keep up the good work. we all appreciate the quirk of your masterful work. short and sweet. appreciated and neat ;)
Al is wholesome and continues to make content thank you
Ayyy
My man is the *GOAT!*
Funny how a guy named weird Al has been completely free of scandal for his entire career.
Certified Prequel Trilogy Classic
This video has everything
Is it just me, or is Al starting to look like Arlo Guthrie?
Gave me a big smile - Thanks so much.
this is what happens when you dont get nose job 10 different times, this guy looks great
That's what Joe biden said
Man the years have not been kind to the Nostalgia Critic.
It's only when you have cause to believe they're bad orders that you're supposed to disobey. I still wanna wait for a walk light at 3 AM.
Hi AL! 👋
Thanks brother for making me laugh the last 40 years!!🙏
Where exactly is that?  It kind of looks like Toronto.
That excuse has never been valid. Shame on you, Al.
WATCH, LIKE and SUBSCRIBE!
Russel Brand is looking rough. Off the wagon? (Screw the Bees!)
That caught me off guard
Truly a more brilliant and accurate reflection of modernity has not been communicated as effectively as this true work of art. Weird Al based af.
I thought this was Robert Plant for a second
You knucklehead... I love you!!!
Don't let the powers that shouldn't be tell you what to do.
Thank you Al for the decades of smiles and pure, genuine happiness.
That guy looks just like Weird Al Yankovic... but older and wiser.
This guy is weird.
A very subtle way to portray a very real message in a world that is going in a scary direction.
Your John Cleese transformation is almost complete.
I want to see his version of a "Stop Ahead" sign.

You gotta appreciate he never lost being a smartass

*waves back*
Al isn’t weird.. Everyone else is.
That is no excuse and a sure way to hell...
"We do what we're told"
What does that even mean?
No no no no.... Weird Al is looking old.... I'm ancient! 😭
_View, smile, like._
Shouldn’t it read “Stop Look Walk”?  I mean WTF are my tax dollars paying for?  And even more upsetting, why do we need instructions on how to use a GD crosswalk?  Love you oh Weird one.
You're a sweet soul. Never stop being you.
Weird Al is a national treasure.  :D
Al, you make us happy.
We need a movie Al, the epic franchise has killed the spoof movie. You can bring it back!
How can you not love Weird Al Yankovic, I refuse to believe that a person can have a justification for not liking him.
Legend. You look like a grand wizard these days. You have been bringing joy to my family and I for my entire life. Thank you.
Who is Alyan Kovic?
My grandma, “go sweep the front of the bus  My legalistic 9 year old self, **starts sweeping the headlights**
For a moment I thought you were Billy Connolly!
That was some seriously intense looking!! 😃
Al is The Man!  Very underrated in my opinion.  His live shows are great!
“There’s no point in growing up if you can’t be childish sometimes”
Weird.
Was not expecting this. Was not disappointed.
Thank you for making life a little brighter.
Is that Victoria BC by chance?
Now this is a quality shitpost
Weird Al is the world's cool uncle.
Is he slowly morphing into Bruce Campbell?
I read the name of the channel as “Alan Kovic” and thought to myself, “wow this guy looks a lot like Weird Al.” 🤦‍♂️
Stop...Look...Wave markers in American crosswalks would be protested as an overreaching Government stealing its citizens freedom to get run over.
Ah yes. The algorithm. Good to see you all could make it, gentlemen. I’m glad to see your invitations found you without issue. We spent days evaluating your choices from months ago. Welcome to this video.
Matthew 6:33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God
Mr. Yankovic, you know who else was just following orders... (j/k)
THIS is why I love you! ❤
This man taught me that its 100% ok, and pretty fantastic!, to be a nerd geek and dork all rolled into one.  I learned this from him in 1982, and I've never changed since.
Is everyone saying Al or AI? I demand serifs.
And who says smoking crack isn't good for you! 🤷🏻‍♂️
Good soldiers follow orders
Al is the reason I make up song parodies - I'm not good at it but I have fun trying.  BTW Yankovic is cool. 🥶🤍
I love you Al!
truly awesome
Cross my arms across my chest and yells "Weird Al Forver!" But for real, I was SOOOOO thankful I got to see you live in Denver a few years back. You put on one awesome show man! I will forever listen to your stuff.
The GOAT!
I love you, man.
Yay!
I love your new Billy Conolly look
You the man AL! 😎
Hey it's Al.
I thought it was the guy who won this year's bake off
This is the first time I’ve ever seen Weird Al look older than he did in 1973
I get mocked when I say that Weird Al should play the Super Bowl but seriously...who would object? Does anyone doubt that he could put on a real show that people would be talking about?
I want Al to be the human diplomat for First Contact, he's truly the best we have to represent us.
He got his mustache back!
he kind of looks like bruce camble for a few seconds there lol
You are a great person Al.. everytime I think of you.. it invokes a smile and warm positive thoughts.  Thank you for walking this earth :-D Stay safe. oh soon merry christmas.
lol :D funny man
could you do 1 of your 'interviews' with joe biden??   so much good material
That's a good one
Al, my 8 year old loves you and I literally found 24 Weird Al videos in my youtube history today from the kid!
Ha! I didn't recognize you until you smiled.
Thanks for that man! I needed it!
50-80 years from now there may be US citizens on trial saying, "I was only following orders".
Who's this weirdo
goddammit
Weird Al is still such a vibrant and funny guy even for his surprising age :D Hope I could meet him somday
Wow Weird AL still has Amazing curly locks. 😍 always loved his Hair. It should have it's own show. 🤭
This man has aged like a fine wine
Freaking weird Al, man, he’s living a good life.
Love you Al oh and thanks for the Kid Rock shade 😆
Weird Al, You rule!
I'm poor and spending thanksgiving alone without a thanksgiving dinner....but some rich guy did a goofy thing and 1.5 million people pay attention.  The extinction level asteroid couldn't come sooner.
Don't follow orders, Al! Unless you really want to <3 Happy Thanksgiving!
Youre the best Weird Al!
Three doritos locos tacos and a chalupa with a large Baja Blast zero.
Been following since Mr Frump.
I love you
Love Weird Al.
Wow, your old.
Love you Al
He looks like the most huggable dad my god. Weird al is for always.
I love him
Hey sir...  how are you!??
I a big fan.of the man.
been listening to weird Al from 1988-2021--------------------
Still the coolest guy ever
This guy is weird
997 need to just Eat It…..
Al grew up without any money in a tiny house. Bullied because he was 2 years younger than his classmates all through school, graduating as valedictorion, bullied in college because he was only 16 years old, he never became bitter or hateful. Al is kind, generous and compassionate. Thank you Al for setting such a good example.
This made my day.
I love weird al!
Can you imagine just walking down the street one day, and suddenly seeing Weird Al filming a skit on the sidewalk?
Brilliant
For a second, I thought that was John Cleese....
Based and Al pilled
"catchphrase" chariots chariots
cringy.
I know it bombed but can we talk about galavant and how awesome that show was and how funny the monks were with this man leading them ;3
Al for President
well done sir.
Weird Al = CLASS Stay safe Mr. Al 🙏
He looks like an olden day super nice king that's in disguise as a commoner so he can enjoy little things too 👑🥺
And this is why he was arrested for war crimes.
Where the fuck is your mask
Hahaha 🤣 We love you Weird Al!
Not only is he making an awesome pseudo-political/social commentary but the humor remains intact. True legend, so glad to be a listener since the 90s!
I know exactly what he looks like, but I still don't think I could recognize this man if I saw him.
He's looking like Billy Connolly these days.
Oh, hi Al 👋
Weird Gal Spankabitch
0:01 Epic foreshadowing look down near his legs
That is what there gonna say to the UNV@XED before they let us starve to death.
Hahaha xD
Sometimes it seems like everything is going to be okay.  This is one of those times.
lol
This lad, look at him! Such a delight!
I thought it would be a cross walk sign... you know how it tells you to stop. So if you don't make it across the street your just supposed to stand in the middle of it I guess.
Does this Alyan Kovic guy remind anyone else of Weird Al? That parody musician? Or is it just me.
This guy had gen z humor before it existed
0:02 existential crisis
I love you man
Greatest troll ever....Sorry artist because he is .
Looking a bit like a younger Billy Connolly there
Weird Al is turning into Robert Plant. I suppose that's apropos.
Since when does Al Yankovic follow orders?
Ah man, St Yankovic is getting old... which reminds me that I'm getting old.
Welcome back la mustache!!!
Love you, Weird AL!
Why has it become a 1.4 mil view worth video?
I saw your show about 10 years ago at the Chesaning Showboat in Chesaning Michigan… it’s in my top five of live shows…  Absolutely amazing band and lead man..
What else would you expect from a guy named *WEIRD AL* ?
This is just too wholesome.
Me when the video first started: “What is he doing?” Me in last two seconds of video: “Ahh.” 😂
May I see your (vax) papers?
That's no defense. But.... You're free to go, ON probation.
lol lol lol  lol lol lol lol
Hey Al.
I saw a family doing a parody on Weird Al so I had to get to the original.  https://youtu.be/fHtAnvRC1Rg
This man just summed up my mind with a 11 second clip.
After WWII, this meant something very different.
You have been a blur of positivity my entire life.  Love ya man.
0:03 RIGHT AS THIS HAPPENED MY PRINTER SLAMMED SHUT!
Weird Al wouldn't be Weird Al if he....... ................................. ............................................................................................................. ........................ .wasn't.
Al is awesome. Thank you man.
🛑 👀 🌊
I was about 6 years old, the youngest of 12 with older siblings fresh out of College. One of those older siblings used a tape recorder regularly and listened to Dr. Demento all the time. They came home one day really excited and gathered all of us up to listen to a funny song being sung about our Family Car, a Plymouth Belvedere. A few years later I heard that same voice singing MY BOLOGNA, a parody of My Sharona by The Knack. I've been hooked ever since!! I was such a huge fan, I knew the entire Dare To Be Stupid album by heart. WORD FOR WORD. Weird Al will forever be one of the greatest Performers the Music Industry and Hollywood could ever have. Along with Jim Stafford and Ray Stevens.
The first time I seen him was on mtv with the jurassic park claymation song, my grandma changed it and said it was against God but I changed it back when she left the room and turned the TV dial down to 2 and sat close.. I was so amazed and I knew it was art somehow. And I even knew he was just joking about jurassic park.. it wasn't against God, my family jus loved suppressing my creativity.. I'm jus glad this man taught me to bend the worlds rules and make my own path..
I'm so happy he still being himself
NATIONAL. TREASURE.
oh, and Al, i have sadly lost my they might be giants hat i had you sign at one of their concerts so i would think of you every time i sweat.  i wonder if you remember my weird request.
your face somehow seems to be morphing into all the members of monty python simultaneously.
This is the first time I see him a bit older than the time before
Not that he'll see this, but I watched the video, shook my head and thought to myself, "He's weird".  Then I realized what I thought and laughed. Well done, Al; your name is apt to this very day.
Genius!
Are we sure this wasn't Eric Idle?
Weird Al starts looking more and more like Christopher Lee, I think....
This man is too wholesome for this world
Legend ✋🏼🤚🏼 ⬇️
National treasure
Yeah, but he becomes a real diva when it comes to polka music! 😂
And this is the guy Pinkie Pie chose over me...
I needed this laugh today 😅 thanks man 💜
Gee, I sure hope it does...
Good soldiers follow orders
The universe produces very few perfect souls. I do believe you are one of them. 🙏
Did not recognize him with mustache
He never dissapoints.
Classic Nuremburg defense...
That's how it starts...
Why is this good? Im happy now
Everytime I see Weird Al it brings a smile to my face and brightens my day. The man is a national treasure.😄👍
Dang, Al's gotten old.  Still pretty funny.
Youre so awesome and UNDERRATED as a human.
That was the best 11 sec. Bang for buck ive seen.  Al kicks ass.
For a minute there I thought it was a soggy Bruce Campbell.
Damn Al, you remind me better how we are getting old.
This is white and nerdy!
No one gets me to audibly chuckle "eheheheheh" like Weird Al does.
“If your dog makes a poo, please put it in the rubbish bin.”  (it’s sad to know how many perfectly good dogs have been thrown away after making a poo 😞)
Well done, sir. I performed “Fat” for my 4th grade talent show.  I put a pillow under my shirt to look even fatter. In retrospect I think it was fat shaming. Sorry 😢
Al, you are a gift and we are blessed. Thank you. Loving you always. 💕
Dammit, Al. Lol!
"Just following orders" is not a valid defense.
haha that's what's up.  much love and blessings good sir
This phrase saved no one during nuremberg triap
Ahh, the simple things in life. I'm still laughing. thank you weird Al
I saw UHF in the theater and my date wanted to leave after 20 minutes. I stayed and watched the entire movie.
He did it.
Alien: Human, describe "dad."
Thats where we're heading folks. Weird also no dummy
hey it's Al "Weird Al" Alyankovich              Al
Al rules!
His sense of humor is timeless, it changes with each generation...he's a master of comedy
Just a wholesome giggle from the polka king! I love it!
I was in Bali in 1986 walking home from the pub and a tv in a bar was playing the Like a Surgeon video. I started laughing. Al was universal.
He needs to shave that of his lips
Al, there is nothing weird about us my good man.  Its 2021.   There is weirdness amongst us like no other time...and we are no longer it.  In fact we are as dull as a dried up piece of toast.  Thanks for all the laughs.  I'm still and always laughing with you.  These young ones are really weird.
If this is all he has for material against Ole pedo Joe & his legions of tards then I'd say he ain't the same. Relearn how to punch up Al.
Tha legend. The O.G. The GOAT. Tha homie.
Waiting for the followup where he puts big comma stickers between the words
He did… he did… you know, the thing!
But are you vaccinated?
What can I say? Law abiding citizen.
Good for you obeying the law!
I met Weird Al Yankovic
my love for him over grows over time
Al! Where the hell ya been...
weird al slowly evolving into billy connolly
*His hair! I will FOREVER be JEALOUS!!!* 💗
RIP Weird Al. He said he was " Just following orders " before his life was cut tragically short by the fascist time cops .
I love the fact that this man’s existence is a Jojos reference
Wow. Al is finally showing his age.  Not a knock,. Dude just looked the same for last 30 years
#quantumtalkwav🐝 #quantumtalkevo🐝 Wave:  The first social interaction learned before talking. It connects us to a pre-verbal mind and body. Very healing.  Further instructions: Wave Wash your hands and face  Have something to drink Eat  Hug You will feel better -wendy
No talking!
Al looking like a majestic wizard come down to share ancient knowledge from his time in the mountains  And also have some fun, because the ancient knowledge is that there's never a time you shouldn't try to be happy
Laws are written in black and white because it’s not colored. That order of words is not enforced therefore not law but a request!
Make Polka Great Again
I love u
Ha ha
His wave is so friendly, if the street could've, it would've waved back.
Al, did the white and nerdy 👋 wave…
“All tyrannies rule through fraud and force, but once the fraud is exposed they must rely exclusively on force.”  — George Orwell
I live how natural he is❤️❤️ he reminds me of my wacky chemistry teacher as well. Just an amazing guy
Sign of the time!
Remember back then when u did Amish Paradise, nowadays that Rucka Rucka Ali dude  lol
Glad to see you are alive and well al' Was fun seein ya in spokane back in 2009.
A national treasure
He's starting to look like Billy Connolly, and I approve
Clap. I will hide my smile if I saw that in person.
‘Just following orders’ is less funny in concentration camps or genocide.
A good dad makes dad jokes with word play.  A great dad makes dad jokes without the need for "words".
Ya done gud.😂
This man is basically the embodiment of godly humor itself
Google somehow knows I just made my Mom listen to "The Saga Begins," so now I get this genius recommended on YT. I first  heard it for the first time when I was on vacation in South Carolina, I saw WAY was putting on a show... Still have and wear my _Running with Scissors_ t-shirt from that show. Never giving it up!   CAPRICORN!
I know he's probably not a saint, but he's the closest thing to it. I'm jealous of his wife.
So weird, luv ya Al!
Al i thought you were still churning butter whilst Jacob ploughs....fool
All I gotta do* is make a 12 second video of a visual pun, and I get a million views a week." **Stretches luxuriously** "Yup! This is the life!" -Weird Al.   *And spend 50 years maniacally busting my tukus with my best friends to create a lifelong bond with several generations of beautifully loyal,  rabid-yet-chill, intelligent fans. That too.
He saw a sign!
Jesus has truly helped me in my life. He is real. He is coming back one day. We all have to repent for our sins. We have to stop the sin. We have to love one another. Please turn your hearts and thoughts toward Jesus the Son of the Living God! Thank you
Jajaja
Catch myself falling for that all the time. It’s why I wear elbow pads on my chin. Nono… It’s not what you think…. I strap an elbow pad to my chin. Protection for the Jaw dropping surprises from YHWH. Sheesh. This is so good.
He looks like every music professor I had in college nowadays 😂
Thank you AL I needed that was having a bad morning I just needed to laugh.......
Eric Idle with long hair?
CHAD SUPREMO
I first heard Weurd AL on Dr Demento KMET (little bit a heaven 94.7 kmet, tweedle dee) Los Angeles.. back when he recorded his first hit in a bathroom if my memory holds correct..
Al is looking more like the Spectre Sound Studios guy
I never thought AL or his songs were funny. My unpopular opinion 🤪
Isn't this Billy Jones from Muppet treasure Island movie
I love al
Holy smokes, it is you...I have two words for you... "eat. it. "... 🍔🍟🍕
Won't hold up in court man
spread the word about God
Weird Al and Danny Elfman have found the secret to low-key and long term success...and the fountain of youth apparently!
AI presents Al
Yeah, that’ll work.
You know the Eichmann defense did not work... (lol)
literal vine energy
Yes
Now that is funny! 🇺🇸🤘🇺🇸
Wait, but what are those instructions actually supposed to accomplish
Nice to see you Al. I have to admit it has been a while.
Classic Al.
chad
...this was considerably less dark than the title suggested.
👋👋👋
Stick your arm out. Get the jab.  Get on your knees and pull our pants down and open your mouth.  Give everything you worked for away.
Well thank God the sidewalk didn't say  to "Stop, Wave, Burn Down Some Innocent Person's Shop".  Good on ya, Al!
It's starts that way. Soon they will want us to get vaxinations. What's next? Not being able to be above a certain blood alcohol content to drive a car? Organized society ptsh
I burst out laughing
Best educational vid EVER!!!
Give me liberty, or give me death!
How's it? Are you near the White House? CAN you read this now?... I'll wait... *sounds of dial up*...
Good to see you Al…..
Yeah well that's exactly what the Nazi soldiers said. Just following orders. Cool guys.
Weird Al is so based I love this man
Holy sht. I remember seeing him in White and Nerdy mv. Hes gotten so old, yet still a legend
That hair makes him look like an equivalent of a peacock
So obedient WA
Hooray Williamstown! I will never look at that crosswalk the same way again :D
It’s videos like this that make me wonder as to well weird all hasn’t done a video game Polk?!~ Cause that would be fun, awesome, full of references, and just darn right hilarious!!!~
yes... YES....     This is my humour!
"Just following orders"  POV: You're the judge at the Nuremberg trials
I’m disappointed Al, bad things have come from men “just following orders.”  /s   Been a fan since the 90s, keep up the amazing work!
So simple, yet so clever & so fun! (Probably a good overall summary of Weird Al Yankovich as well.)
smile and wave boys smile and wave
Billy Connolly's looking good.
Why is everyone commenting about AI?  I don’t remember seeing a robot.
I mean, how can you not wave back? I know I did.
well at least we know that HE FOLLOWS STREET SIGNS....eh....eh...🙄😏🤪🤪🤪🤣🤣🤣
EVENT  201
Don't wave at me  Al.  I just want to be left alone.  OKAY?  "The most terrifying force of death comes from the hands of Men who wanted to be left Alone. They try, so very hard, to mind their own business and provide for themselves and those they love. They resist every impulse to fight back, knowing the forced and permanent change of life that will come from it. They know that the moment they fight back, their lives as they have lived them, are over. The moment the Men who wanted to be left alone are forced to fight back, it is a form of suicide. They are literally killing off who they used to be. Which is why, when forced to take up violence, these Men who wanted to be left alone, fight with unholy vengeance against those who murdered their former lives. They fight with raw hate, and a drive that cannot be fathomed by those who are merely play-acting at politics and terror. TRUE TERROR will arrive at these people's door, and they will cry, scream, and beg for mercy... but it will fall upon the deaf ears of the Men who just wanted to be left alone."
His appearance is starting to remind me of Billy Connolly
Born in 65 heard you on  Q107 on the Dr ? Show as a kid
Al is to music what Betty White is to everything else.
That wave was LIT!
Nice to see him get out of the nursing home.
My favorite is still the floating orb soup ladle.  It will never be topped.
I need to sing along to a couple songs again sometime soon.. Thanks for all the laughs and great musical times!
Some of the darkest periods in history were accomplished by men “just following orders”. You make me sick.     How did I do with my millennial outrage? I’m trying to work on being more vitriolic. But I’m not sure I’m totally there yet. Any pointers would be appreciated.
Broh, I fucking flinched hard when he stopped 😂😂😂😂😂
Haha
Anyone else notice in this clip, how much he looks like Eric Idle?
The man himself
9.5/10
what an inspiration to us all
Al is an S tier youtuber
This was amazing.
"I was just following orders."  - Nazi officier circa Nuremberg trials, 1945.
I can’t tell if that noise is his foot, or he really put in the minecraft fall noise
Weird Al!
I love it 👌🤘
Al, I absolutely adore these little moments where you poke fun at signs. I still think of you anytime I see a "10 Items Or Less (Fewer)" sign at the store. I look forward to seeing more of them. :D
Kinda looks like syndicate project
He has glorious flow! Look at that hair!
Good soldiers follow orders.
How is this man still alive?
Thank you
Wow
Where the hell is this?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Looking like Billy Connolly
When saw cop on street and making it like not drunk
That dude's Weird.
Bro I always wave
GOAT 🐐
For this type of stuff. Is why I've always been a fan. Since FAT. LoL.
Weird Al, keepin' it...literal. ;-)  It's been too long since I've been to a concert.
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Always laugh to myself when I walk past the one office with "please knock" written on the door.
Gotta follow the rules Al!  Al forever!
Stop, Look, Wave  🚏👀👋
Thank you! I needed this bit of wholesomeness today.❤️
LOL! Al Yankovic can always make me laugh.
nice
I'm just imagining what everyone around him thinks he's doing. You know almost no one pays attention to what the road says.
Because of my age and Weird Al, I always thought the good ol boys were drinkin whiskey n rye because  soon they're gonna be jedi's.
ROFL THAT WAS EPIC!
Al rules. Best band in the business.
UHF 2!
Al's been a teasure since the 80s, and he's only tripled in value since then. God I love this man
Oh man! I thought you made a song about today's totalitarianism.   Sorry, you can't work at the hospital Mrs Nurse, you aren't vaccinated, you know how low we are on nurses and can't risk infections.  Sorry, Mr. Haitian, I need to round you up and send you back to your country of origin, I'm just following orders of the president Biden.  Preisdent biden,"I don't like it any more than you do. It ain't right these border agents doing that.  Anyway I'm just following orders from my higher ups."  In this country we respect orders or there would be chaos in the streets->Pan to video of riots happening ....  Weird Al, you have a real good chance to make a video today that would rock this whole Iran/China take over of the US from the inside...  Want to collab? I do parody too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wMWVT_N27U&list=PLOQ-J23AJUfTlLHkmqqFQIS8_ewaSaCqx&index=2
AL for President
I just watched a show on Hulu called "Y: The Last Man," in which a virus kills all the men on Earth except one. One of the episodes is called "Weird Al is Dead," which is maybe the saddest thing I ever read.
Your weird, Al.
Dammit! That worked. You made me chuckle. Thanks Al and camera wielder!
You are an OG
Wait, that's a thing?!
Funny 😆
I forget this man is old. His legacy is still quite powerful.
Still white and nerdy
Damn I’m feeling so old.
He never had the markings of a varsity athletes
This says a lot about our society
Jesus whom is the one and only true God and Creator came to earth 2000+ years ago to go to the cross to pay our sin debt in full. His sacrifice was sufficient to pay the penalty for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2). A created being could not pay the infinite penalty required for sin against an infinite God. Only God could pay such an infinite penalty. Only God could take on the sins of the world (2 Corinthians 5:21), die, and be resurrected, proving His victory over sin and death and that true and only God is JESUS! And He did all that because He loves us and wants to save us and have a relationship with us. Jesus is waiting for you to come to Him, He won't cast you away from Himself if you come to Him. He calls us all to repentance, He loves us and wants to save us. believe and have faith in God then the Holy Spirit will come in and lead you to repent of your sins and God will forgive you of your sins and cleanse you by the blood of Jesus and you'll get born again by His Holy Spirit and have His salvation, you will become a new creation (John 3:3-19). God bless
Now that is what I call a law abiding citizen
What's the building behind you - a church? A museum?
Hello!
Old School Fan since Eat It, if not before 🤣🤣
Weird Al for POTUS... dude is seriously smart too.
I remember listening to Dr Demento when I was a teen and only one radio station stayed on after midnight. Heard Al sometime after that since I’m 5 years older than him. Love you Al, keep being yourself 😍
🛑👀🙋
Just smile and wave boys....smile and wave.😄👋🏽
Weird Al still has it. He is a comedic badass!
I still recall listening to Dr.Demento's Radio Show and hearing Al as a kid, still enjoy him and will always .. Hell i recall to this day (surprisingly) going to the theaters to watch the movie UHF, of which ive probably viewed 50x Stanly Spadowski (sp?) and his mop... i always wanted to drink from the Fire Hose too, looked like a great time :P   . Glad to see hes still at it :)  Cheers .
"I've been at the mercy of men just following orders. Never again" - Eric Lehnsherr
Amazing
We were just following orders....
Oh god im finally noticed that weird all is aging and not some ageless entity 😢
You look badass man
So great to see you still going Strong.. I got onboard back in 1992 as a teen with the album "off the deep end" only one among my friends here in Denmark that listend to your music back then.. I followed it up with "bad hair day" in 1996 and "running with scissors" in 1999.. To this day my 3 favorite albums of all time.
I wave like that 🤣
Weird Al?
What a weird fella
Our king has returned
What a weirdo
*STOP  LOOK  COMMENT*
We need more Al . Less 2021 . Al is like cow bell , and you can never have too much cowbell.
I thought this was about nazis and the holocaust. 😅😅😅
Execute order 66
Classic!
Woah. You don't see Weird Al for years and all of a sudden, he's John Cleese.
_good soldiers follow orders_
One of my favourite songs is his eBay song. I still find it hilarious….
We love you, Al.
When Al Yankovic forays into boomer humor 😢. You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
*What a wondrous man.* *Truly, he's a gift to us.* *God bless Yankovic!*
Here's Al jamming out in concert! Amazing!!!! https://youtu.be/q9NwcJC_2p4 Al's a happy man!!!
WEIRD AL NEEDS TO DO THE SUPER BOWL!!!
Dude looks like George Harrison in this!
How do you help but love this man 😍🥰😂
You're silly.
Schizophrenia
Ok
Good soldiers follow orders
11 seconds of bliss
Who down voted this? Its time to reflect.
They don’t call him weird for no reason!
It was 1988 when my friend had a Cadette with Dare to be Stupid on it. I think it was 2001 when I saw him live and I just laughed at this in 2021. Truly an iconic figure.
Is this the soup man?
I like that he gets old in real time but doesn't get any less silly
Saruman makes pretty good memes
Whoa, I'm shocked at how much he looks like my Dad!
Hahahaha!!
The first time I ever heard Weird Al was on a Dr. Demento's music video countdown along with a song called "fish heads" .. good times
🤣🤣🤣
Weird. 🙂
OMG he brought the mustache back. Yes!!! Finally!
Good soldiers follow orders...
I didn't know "Weird Al Yankovic" was still alive?
Beautiful
"He who is tired of Weird Al is tired of life."
>Just Following Orders That's exactly what the Nazis said!
Hahaha
Obey.  Where was your mask?  You almost killed that person behind you!
Right on brother
I thought it was clickbait!
Thought this was a diffrent kind of joke...
Silly lol
Al looks handsome with that stache and mane
He is turning into Forrey Ackerman
*This is the only human being on planet Earth that has had a #1 album in FOUR CONSECUTIVE DECADES (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s).  Just let that sink in for a few moments.*  *I can't wait for his 2020s #1 album.* 👍
weird al in williamstown?!
You're silly and I adore it.  Thanks for the chuckle.
😂
He finally aged . It only took 40 years lol. He’s looking more like young bill Connolly lol.
Well done citizen
A bit wholesome though
“Weird” Al Yankovic / Emo Phillips 2024. Just sayin’
My Great-Grandfather tried this defense at Nuremburg. It didn't work so well for him...
Yup still the OG of Weird.
Coming into this, I thought it would be some nazi joke.
Am I retarded or does he look a bit like Eric Idle when he's pulling that face.
Seeing Weird Al out of nowhere on my feed was an instant mood boost, glad to see he’s doing alright after all these years!
This is why we had the Nuremburg trials.
He looks so old now!
Love it, Weird Al!!
Only a few understand what he’s saying
Pretty sure Weird Al could take the #1 Billboard hit and make an even better "Let's Go Brandon" single. Just saying.
He is in Williamstown MA. At Williams College. Where his daughter attends. Right up the road from me
This makes me happy. 😊
He's aged so beautifully.
Awwwe he’s so nostalgic 💕
Ah ya got me
When I was a kid, I had heard from my dad that Al died. I cried. When I saw him again( years later) I got that feeling like when you walk into a cold spot in an old house, or listen to campfire stories and get a cold breeze. I was so happy and confused. I think... Al Yankovic is a necromancer... He necromanced himself when he saw his fans in pain.
You are an absolute treasure
He's speaking of the vaxxy fascists
Who is this Alyan Kovic and why have we never heard of him?
Dear NFL, You suck by picking all R&B for the Super Bowl this year. Weird Al is a freaking genius. When will you wake up and get some good musicians for halftime. Weird Al has been around longer than the show you have planned for this year COMBINED!
*THE WORST ATROCITIES IN HISTORY WERE CARRIED OUT BY PEOPLE JUST FOLLOWING ORDERS!*
I remember him. He made great songs !
Been a fan for 30+ years!!!
that was some oscar level acting there
Weird Al was just following orders
Al time to come back and make fun of all these new songs lame people put out. Al I know you can make them better.
Hail the king
Such a majestic creature
Love you, buddy!
That's exactly what the Nazis said.🤔🤔🤔🤔
Everybody stop hey what's that sound everybody look what's going down....... great reset
He is a national treasure alongside Dolly Parton ❤
Time to curse at YouTube for not sending me my notifications for my dream partner in crime best friend in my head.
Genius
Priceless
Carry on citizen.
Just following orders. The Jesuit Order
In this world that’s normal!
Awesomeness! #ClubOsprey
Awesome.
give him small round glasses and he look exactly like Billy Connolly
Been a fan of weird al since I was 5 for 25 yrs. This guy.  He's a guy.  Idk much else about him,  But he's a guy, I'm a guy I like his work.
.
Ahh Billy Connolly, he hasn't aged a bit since he took over on that sitcom head of the class from that guy that used to be on wkrp in cincinnati
what are we doing with our life
So cool to see wierd al become Schneider lol
JUST LIKE THE NAZIS
God I wish he was my uncle or something, obviously not a son because then I would have it on the regular and get tired of it, if he was my uncle then I would see him on occasion
Just saw this dude at a concert love it
Not even weird by today's standards..
My idol is still kickin it dad style <3 The greatest honor would be to meet you one day and explain how you and your impact on the world did so much for me and my family <3 Thank you for being all I aspire to and more <3
*Weird Al*  The man The myth The legend
Al is still the king.
Looks like John Cleese these days.
Thanks for the fun smile and wave.  Brings me back to when I bought my first CD, Alapalooza and played it non stop.  May the kid never stop in all of us.
I know what's going on in Hollywood, please don't be one of them. You're a Hometown hero here I remember meeting your parents my sister remembers meeting your parents and I think she still has that sign CD you gave her.
I thought this was gonna be a lot more subversive or least Goodwin worthy
I can't be the only one who thinks Weird Al looks a tad bit like Robert Plant right?
You were my very first concert in St.Petersbueg Florida in the 90s,.I was probably 8 and listened to you 24/7.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
The one time where the Nuremburg Defense is not only allowed, but encouraged.
Hello, I have a question for the experts here.  When Al covered Toto's Africa with Weezer, who did the voice?  Did they autotune Al's voice or was he lipping it?
that was funny :0 )
It said nothing about smiling,…FAIL Al..fail..
Was the excuse of every Nazi soldier in Germany. There you go I finished the title for you 😊
Has it ever been confirmed that Al isn't related to Billy Connolly? The two of them are the only ones who can pull off this, rockin mane/goatee, look.
Truly a masterpiece.
He's looking like Billy Connolly
Only thing that’s missing is oblivion music
I got to meet the man in person last weekend on Halloween, at the "Nightmare Before Christmas Live Show" in L.A. . I screamed at him on stage like a jr high girl screams at Harry Styles.     As our family group was leaving out the ADA exit, my sister-in-law (who paid for all this, I'm broke, so thank you) shouted and pointed towards Sir Yankovic. He was headed out past. The elevators. I ran up like I was a kid looking up at a superstar, even tho' I'm 6'5". He immediately stopped to take a photo with me and then fist bump me. I quickly blurted out that his signed pic used to hang in the barbershop I went to as a kid (He had family that lived in that town, so I always hoped to see him walk in for a cut, but, alas, it wasnt meant to happen) I was so giddy like a piddly puppy. The rush of memories and the confirmation that this timeless superstar is a genuinely nice person is a special moment that I will cherish.     I liked the movie before the show, just not obsessively as some. But after the live show, and finally getting to see Weird Al on stage, I'm a huge fan now.     My love for all things Weird Al, especially UHF, has brought me back to when my brother and I would listen to all of our dad's tapes in our room while playing Bionic Commando and Top Gun all night long. The long road trips when our parents would actually play Weird Al & Dr Demento to give us break from the hyper-loud rock or Michael Bolton or the worst, Enya (as a kid Enya sukt, now, ehh).    On the ride home I went right to Spotify and played Weird Al music and haven't stopped since. My wife is a fan, not like me, but she enjoys listenin. She gets a kick out of my laughs and the stories I tell when certain songs or lyrics remind me of a good time when I was listening to Weird Al as child, teenager, young adult, and now an 40's something husband with a kid in college.    God Bless you Weird Al Yankovic, your music genius was and is a part of my life. The opportunity to meet you was special, however brief, it meant a lot. The picture of you and I was immediately sent to my brother so I could brag like brothers do. Again, from the bottom of my heart, a huge fan, thank you, sir.
It's Just Like The Simulations
this is what the internet is for
Ah, like everyone else. Lol
Where's your mask?
Royalty
:waves back: :D
I'm on the good part of Youtube.  Seriously, this guy is the personification of the bright side of the internet.
Hehehe my immediate thought was I hope to marry a man just like him
[waves back]
People who are found in sin are under the meteor of God's wrath, for those that fall upon the stone shall be broken but those who are found under it shall be grinded to powder. Those that are found broken on the stone are those who are converted to new life in Christ but those found under the stone are those that have earned God's Righteous judgement. When you grind something to powder, that means you've done a thorough job with it. God is going to do a thorough judgement for those on the day of judgement who are not found in Christ. This is pretty scary because falling on the face of the sun is 100 googolplex better than falling unto God's wrath. For example, it says that God will judge every idle talk, every thought, every deed, every sexual imagination, all the pride, everything period will God judge. That's how thorough he'll be. Here's the light though, the capital punishment that God has laid upon us (death) because we've all sinned can be freely taken off us not because we are good but because God is good in that he gave his life for us on the cross which has made a way for us to be feely forgiven by God's mercy and have the free gift of everlasting life. All you have to do is repent and put your faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, and to know that he died on the cross for our sins, and rose from the dead on the third day as it is written in the scriptures. That word repentance means a lot more than just asking for forgiveness, it means having that Godly sorrow and perpetually turning from sin daily because as a true Christian, we don't repent with worldly sorrow as to say that we keep doing the things we're sorry about after our repentance.
Wow he is just now starting to age. I thought he was immortal for awhile
“weird al was just following orders”
We love you Al!!!!!! 💖✨💐😄🤗♥️
He's aged well, he's still got comedy in him, and always down to Earth. Like Jim Varney before him, he's funnier off-camera and off-stage than on.
I've been on the Nature Trail to Hell, in 3-D almost my entire life.
And just like that, another $3-$5k in Yankovic's pocket. 12 seconds, 1M+ views...
sing the song about the ting n whatnot i like that
Weird Al is not my dad..... but I feel like he could be...
This deserves 3 views and 1 like. Good day.
Since the 80s I've followed this AMAZINGLY TALENTED HUMAN BEING.....UHF IS STILL MY GO TO FEEL GOOD WHEN IM SICK AT 44 YEARS OLD LOL.....WE DONT NEED NO STINKIN BADGERS!!!!
Lookin' good Al👍
😀🖐  🤔  🌮🌮🌮🌮🐿
Based
Nice
This says a lot about society
No! His age is showing!
What a legend 😊
ITS BEEN YEARS! COME BACK TO USSSSSS!
Thought he was going to be outside Auschwitz
Why did i think this would be a video on nazi germany
Ahhh Weird Al. Forever the cool weird uncle of the internet and a man I would bet money gives INCREDIBLE hugs.
This man is a treasure
My heart.  I love this man.
Hahaha next you should get 2 vaccinations followed by countless booster shots.
I saw him in concert at a casino in Buffalo, NY. Was a small show but highly entertaining. Don't recall much but the encore was delayed to give him time to get out of the 'Fat' suit.
I thought this Will be a war crime meme
I love you.
hhahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahqhqhahqhqhqhqhqhhqhahqhahahqhah
He's such a legend!
Is this Ottawa?
I love you, Al!
This man is a national treasure
l o l
Let's turn to God https://youtu.be/gd6zrrC-M0k explains whole Bible
I don't know why but I think weird Al is fly.  😊
Love you Al, I've probably bought UHF four times. Never gets old
👋😁
That guy looks just like....HEY!!
Weird Al! Love ya man (platonic)! Christmas at ground zero was my favorite song as a young teen and I STILL sing "One more Minute" to my wife for fun all the time.
This guy is kinda weird...
I mean Weird!!! You have GOT to keep it down!
Who’s Alyan Kovic?
So the smile was your own personal touch 👌
that was dumb.                 but i laughed.
*Bootlicker.*
Looking good as always Al!
Gluten causes every disease
Weird Al is a national treasure
This may not be the wholesome content we asked for, but this is the whole some content we need.
Look, the Red Wave!
Holy, he's aging.
Reminds me of my dad when they changed “don’t walk “ sign to a red hand.  My dad would run up to it and give it a high 5!! 🤣 to follow the rules..miss him
Conform and color! Where's your God damn vaccine passport!
This is one of those things that makes absolutely no sense until the last frame.
What a legend
Thank you Al. This was very insightful
Weird Al is a Legend.
That was weird!!!
Dare to be stupid!
I thought this would have to do with current events and the future trials where this is not accepted as a valid reason for human rights violations… again.
I love this guy.  He's better at life than just about anyone in the last 30 years.. you rock
My wife, son and I saw him a couple times at the Puyallup State Fair in Wa. state. This dude is hilarious AND VERY talented!! He did the costume changes to fit the songs and had "interviews" playing on the big screens while we waited, VERY clever!! Thank you Al for ALL you do!! God Bless you my friend.
He's a gem. We must protect him
When I looked at your name just now under the video I thought "Who's Alyan Kovic?" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
There's something to be said for a man in the public eye for 30+ years and not one person has anything bad to say about him   Al <3 5-ever
The original shitposter
Oblivion NPC
LEGEND
Good Human. Receive reward.
great internet content
A model citizen
Weird Al is a cultural icon and legend. Thanks Al
Honestly
This guy is a genius in France.
I do the body wave personally
Starting to look like Douglas Adams…
There can be only one.
This guy was the best growing up ...the white stuff was my favorite song
😂 This quickly snapped me back into a better mood after a bad morning.
Dear weird Al, never stop being you man
Anyone else think he's starting to look like Christopher Lee?
legend
🤣🤣 Good to see your still around and bringing humor
Looks friendly 👍which is what we need right now. Keep it up Al👌👍
For a moment I thought Russel Brand was looking really old
Weird recognizes weird
Police: *Are you mocking us?!* 👋👊💥
Given the history of "I was just following orders" I was expecting a very very different video
Weird all really went full uncle Oskar
Hey... Williamstown, MA! Enjoy it Sir!
As weird as the world is now, we should all just call him Al.
Legend. Dairy.
I love him. I loved him when I was 8 and I love him now that I'm 34. What a dude 😜
I never thought weird al was funny
I was listening to everything you know is wrong and clicked on this video tab and the second verse kicked in "I was walking to the kitchen for some Golden Grahams when I accidently stepped into an alternate dimension and soon I was abducted by some aliens from space who kinda looked like Jamie Farr" it fits haha  you just need the disembodied head of Colonel Sanders yelling at the end
Old Man Yankovic
I'm still blown away by the tweet Lin- Manuel Miranda had about you  being in my hometown. I also enjoyed 'In the Heights'. P.S. You're starting to look like Arlo Guthrie.
I’ve gone to see Pink, Prince and many others.  However nothing is more fun than a Weird Al Concert.  One of the best evenings of my life.  Thanks Al.💞
😁 Hey AAAAAL!!❤
No way you are in Williamstown, MA!! Williams College to be exact.
Hi Wierd Al!  Good to see people having a good time
Well he's not lying, he really was following orders.
Liking the salt and pepper look Al.
Reminiscent of one of the more light-hearted of my fever dreams.
legend
:)
This man is irreplaceable.
Those weren't the only orders he followed. 😔
Neat.
Wtf
:)
I love you Al
dude, I got some serious "am I talking to me" vibes when he waved...
Why does it say wave?
Why hasn’t Al remixed 69 lmao
Is it just me, or does he look alarmingly like John Cleese?
Get off the va tech campus
What a good role model
Bout time someone follows the goddamn law
I wish my brain didn’t automatically want to associate this with the pandemic politics.
Is it me or is he starting to look more and more like Billy Connolly?
That is weird, Al.
This is great. Thanks for the laugh :D
Great now I have to obey all signs lol
Al is a National Treasure.
I like the goatee
Lmao AL for life
I swear the older Al gets the more he looks like bill connolly from like 20 years ago
Who is Alyan Kovic and what is he doing on my feed? Oh wait lol
Been a fan since Eat it. Just introduced my 9 yr old daughter to Amish Paradise. Hilarious
I love you, you probably won't read this but damn did I need a smile today. Thank you weird Al💙💙💙
You freaking sheeple 😆😏
Made me smile!
I love you Al
That wasn't an excuse at the Nuremberg trials and it isn't an excuse here either.
The US government approves.
My Autistic brain says yes to this. Follow directions. 😁
That's exactly what the Nazi's were doing!!!
So unfunny it's hilarious
Does the Nuremberg Defense apply?
Howdy Al,.. Haven't seen you since late summer in 92 at the Las Vegas Convention Center.. Great times hanging out, hope all is well in the land of Yankovic! 🎸😎🎸
I'm also Balkan. 🇭🇷
I met Al in the early 80's when KQRS in Iowa City, brought him around to plug Another One Rides the Bus.  I was working at Perkins as a cook and he signed my paper hat.  I kept it safe in my desk drawer.  My mother threw it away when she snooped/cleaned my room when I was away on a bicycle trip.  Still love Weird Al Yankovich!
He looks like John Cleese' brother.
Take a well-deserved chuckle! :D
He sure did those things
Great guy
This man, he's the inventor of shitposting, and he does better than everyone else
*Good soliders follow orders*
This dude's been at it since before a lot of our parents even hit puberty. Respect.
I wish Weird Al releases an album that's nothing but polka medleys, can't get enough of them. ❤️
You look 26 not 62.   I’m 24 and need to step my shit up!
Weird Al is one of the few artists I would love to meet
I didn't see it say "smile and wave"  Minus points. Such a shame 😔😅
Understandable. Have a nice day, sir.
I got to go to his concert that he performed with the orchestra, it was probably my favorite concert experience, I wish he kept making music but its nice to see he's still having fun
What a dude
He is starting to resemble John Cleese.. lol
Miss you buddy. We need to see more of your shenanigans in these trying times.
Geezer Butler
I love how he looks like sean connery's character from highlander
I had the pleasure of meeting Al while working at a sushi restaurant in Charleston, WV.   Man was incredibly kind, incredibly gracious, and incredibly tall.  Glad to see you putting out funny content😁
I bet hed be AWESOME to Hang with!
I thought this would be some nazi germany joke.
Good Soldiers Follow Orders
"good soldiers follow orders"
Remember when this guy guest starred on 5SF? Ghoooood times!
Best video of 2021.  Critics everywhere are raving: "Light-hearted fun for the whole family!" "Short. Sweet. Funny!" "A must see!"
I love you al <3 I saw you at the Salem, Oregon fairgrounds when I was 10 years old & it was one of the greatest shows I've ever been to. Thank you for all you do!
looks a bit like john cleese now
fuckin brilliant, so glad to see Al still kickin
This man fills my heart with joy
This has brightened my day and I'm happy today!!
hi Mr. Al. i just want to say hi and wish you a good day
*"IS* *THAT* *A* *"WHITE* *AND* *NERDY"* *REFERENCE?"*
Dude I listened to Amish Paradise in 3rd grade and you still rule!
You love to see it
That didn't spare those put on the Nuremberg trial so don't expect it to save you!
Dunno if this guy is either brilliant or psychotic.
I think Al does this because he knows he cant be too political but everyone around is being sheep because of covid
Hahaha right. Your personality and mine are alike. Is it an adhd thing? You know adult dangling hemorrhoid disease
Al... 💉DO NOT💉 follow THESE orders... please Al.. I thought you were weird.. like us.
Someone make AL Yankovic do a video with Joel Haver .
I miss this guy lol
For a second there I thought he was Billy Connolly.😅
Certified floating orb moment.
Ahhhhh, the Nuremberg defense
Meanwhile the guy named Lookwave: 😐
Why does the older Al gets the more he looks like Russel Brand?
This is the high quality content we need more of
love you weird Al!!!
is this new haven? (yale)
God bless this man.
Oh Al, you're such a treasure
Good soldiers follow orders
*waves*
Always adorable, a beacon of Light.
Weird al?
"Just following orders" a phrase with a totally different meaning when used by comedians, lazy workers, or government goons
He may be physically old but he's young in his heart
Weird became hip thanks to this man 👍
Weird Al is pure gold. He's the best.
Wait, do they actually want us to wave??
now that this has appeared its time to watch more of your music vids
Who else saw the title and thought it'd be a Nuremberg joke
Oh finally. The mustache is on its way back. Al has the greatest mustache
Is AL based and redpilled?
Ah yes, James LaBrie
we love you Al!
Inspirational
I'm surprised that nobody realized the current political situation undertone here
I remember seeing a comment that said weird al is like a fun uncle, and it ages like wine.
Good soldiers follow orders.
Where is this Nuremberg?
Stay weird al stay weird 😂🤙🏼
I saw an older weird Al and he did not disappoint he is still him self even after all this time bless this man ❤🥰🙏
Al even ad lib’d a smile without direction for us!!!  Always entertaining.
It's so simple and yet your day is as bright as the sun now...🤗
Anybody what that building is behind him?
You were literally like 45 minutes away from me 😫
Thanks Al after my day I needed that
This truly was, Just Following Orders.
where is this
I've been at the mercy of men just following orders, never again.
k00ky
Never stop Weird Al, never stop
Hes got the face to be the boss of a drug cartel, that or my uncle.
Following orders didn't work in Nuremberg, pal. What makes you think it'll work now?
Very Weird, Al. Yah see what I did there?
Why is Weird Al slowly starting to look like Adolfo Hitlerino as he ages?
He could play Billy Connolly.
i dont think i ever watched a video by or about al Yankovic on this account but somehow the youtube algorithm still knew to recommend me this video anyway and now i know he has a youtube channel. subscribed
Such a Boomer 😂
Blessed by the algorithm
I thought this was a parody on the way Joe Biden reacts to unplanned questions from the media.  He says he's just following orders too.  Isn't that the excuse the Nazi war criminals used to justify their atrocities during WWII?
Thanks Al!
"Do not touch Willie." Good advice!
I waved back, and then I saw the street.     Hi AL !!
omg hi
a model citizen. thank you for your service.
Magnificent, Alfred
Wish he made more original stuff
Al, I remember meeting you in the lobby of KROQ/AMP radio around 2012. Really a professional, punctual, dedicated to your craft. Glad to see you're doing well, and have a good thing going on here with your channel. Stay awesome!
Love u al
Smh this is how Hitler rose to power
Just a wave from Weird Al and I'm feeling better than I have in a while! Thanks @Al *waves back*
manitou springs
>Weird al posts a 12 second video.  930,281 viewers (Myself included) *FASCINATING*
Hi! George Newman, Channel 62!
God himself with another video, amazing
Well done Sir!
This dude been rocking since 83'
I like the part where he was just following orders.
😆 🤣  Didn't expect that
just watched UHF for the first time since the mid 90s probably. This movie has definitely stood the test of time. Still a great movie
Weird Al has to have a TikTok account right?
Genius. God like you might even say
Hilarious
I thought this was gonna be a national treasure spin-off
Hehe.
You look a surprising amount like Billy Connolly.
Damit Al put the sunglasses back on you can't see the real message that says obey in red don't you see Al you've started to OBEY
Ausitm
Good soldiers follow orders

Lol this made me smile a little i been so down lately thanks i hope everyone has a great day

Yeah, this is stupid.
Sounds kosher to me..
Mmmm, this is about as deep as a lasagna, and with probably as many layers.👍
King 👑😌
Weird Al is one of those artists than more than just meeting them, I wanna give a big long hug 😅 He seems super cool and his music always cheer me up
When we needed him most........ he was there
That won't hold up in a court of law, I'll see you at the Nuremberg trials!
🤣
cringe
must be germany
We love you, Weird!!!!
That was the White and Nerdy smile and wave
🤣
That title is indeed not clickbait.  He was just following orders in the video, just like the title said.
Oh noo china got to him too. Who can save us from china
Seriously Weird, just join TikTok already.
GGs i was the crosswalk
Nazi Germany be like : we're just following orders (stop, shoot and bake)
Al .. I'm sorta gaY foR your beard .. you Really suit that look. or/.. that look suits you ?
"I've been at the mercy of men just following orders. Never again."   Magneto
For a second there I thought it was Billy Connolly
absolute legend!
Honestly thought this was gonna get political for some reason and I don’t know why…
Billy Connolly looks a bit strange here...
I had no idea this was Al's channel, and yet here I am having clicked on this video.
Just like the police officers that taze or arrest people for having no mask.
Weird Al now looks like Bill Connelly's younger brother.
So if the 'stache is back, does that mean he's going for the curly hair again? :D
Frank, they’re not here for you. Weird-Al Yankovic is on the plane 🤩 -Captain Ed Hocken
Seeing Al singing with Peewee Herman and Danny Elfman on Sunday was so much fun. Al is amazing!!!! https://youtu.be/A1bob7qt4fo
Wow, I guess youtube algorithm decides it's time
Just wait till he finds a stop sign.  They never say "Stop, then go".
👋
This is more relevant than most people realize... Just following orders is what happend in Germany in the 1930's and led to Jews being killed in camps.  If you ever hear a soldier or a policeman act under the excuse of "just following orders" know that those people are capable of unspeakable evil.
The 2020s called! They want their '90s back! Give them what they've been missing, Weird Al!
Rocking that warlock look, Mr. Vic.
I feel like this is some next level subversion of an unspeakable current event.
My childhood hero! Also my current hero!
This guy is great
imagine seeing him randomly walking by you in the street lol.
Bro, cheese stocks are bumpin'
Fabulous hair
This is high end artistic expression people.  The political commentary here is relevant and insightful.  Everyone keep thinking he's just a card, some jester... Al is a truly sophisticated genius and renaissance man.
Hey nothing about those orders said to smile...how dareth thee
I totally thought that was Billy Connolly from a distance.... Also never thought Weird Al would age, since he'll always be timeless to me.
Take Les Claypool and mix him with Jon Schaffer and you have "mature" Weird Al.
My cat when there’s a bird outside: 0:03
Please don't retire!!
The glorious randomness continues.
Al starts every morning with a *tall* glass of comedic essence.
Weird Al Is the concentrated power of everybody's favorite uncle
Why it's the Vicar of Yanks! Hello good sir!!
Did weird Al burn the painting that took on his years of age?
Weird Al waves to you on the streets. Do you wave back?
Random video recommendation. I look, "Is that, no it can't be..." turns out it is Al! I want to wave back!
Good Soldiers follow orders Clone Bois
Meme Lord Al Yankovic
Good soldiers follow orders
Nobody asked you to smile
Bro his comedic timing is perfect, idk what else to say
I can't believe how hard I laughed at this! Thank you, Weird Al. We don't deserve you.
Weird Al looking a lot like Bill Connelly.
this man does not age
Aloha braddah!
Pffffffhehehehahhahahahahhahahah Somewhat phonetic reaction. Love this dude. My brothers and I still quote random scenes from UHF all the time.
Hair still epic as ever.
That Al Yankovic fella seems kinda weird.
At an intersection crosswalk a Hand made of lights tells pedestrians to STOP.      Gramma waved back......We'll miss her..........................................................................eventually.
If he’s a grandfather I imagine he’s the best
You still got it mang.
Thanks Al.    This made me smile
I SWEAR TO GOD, YOU BETTER OUTLIVE BETTY WHITE
Good soldiers follow orders
Thought he might be calling out the Australian government or something, but a silly joke will do, I suppose.
Why is he in Williamstown MA?
goddamn his comedy gets me!
Good soldiers follow orders
Fantastic
Jermiah milks the cows, it's ok we'll be laughing when they're burning in hell  Windows 90000 5555555, it's sucking up my driiiiiveee, but my PC, it's obsolete, I need a BRAND NEW MACHHIIINEE  O o o o o o O o o o oreo, whats in the middle?THE WHITE STUFF  Cats in the kettle
Bless this man, I needed a reason to laugh.
Brilliant. 😂
Al looks SO YOUNG!! My gosh...he went to the devil and asked "gimme that Keith Richards deal, but with more preservatives"
Welcome to Williamstown. Try some of the art in North Adams while you're in the area.
Love me some Old Man Yankovic.
Good soldiers follow orders
At least it ain't rainbow...
Glad to see your doing well. Very nice trolling. Keep up the weird.
A good soldier follows orders.
Wait, what does that actually mean?
Only person I will ever forgive for using this excuse.
Wooooooooooooooooooooooo
I wasn't expecting wierd AL to look older since I haven't seen any of his recent stuff. But honestly, he's looking good for 62!
He clearly didn't follow orders. He stopped in the road, hardly looked at anything, but the kicker? He didn't even wave at the road! Not only that, but he waved at one of you humans. I mean one of us humans.  Actually, technically, he's waving at a cellphone. How do we decide which inanimate objects are worth waving at and which ones aren't?
Now this, I love this
You know who else was just "following orders" Al??
do a primus parody
This has 69k likes.             Nice.
Lol
His body aged but his personality didn't. Just as god intended
“Did you know where the train was headed, private Al?”
This is a great commentary on the state of the world right now; in both the excuse and the directive.
Al, we have been Close Personal Friends for many many moons now, and you still do not fail to bring a smile to my face. As Fred Rogers would say,  "Just for being You."
Good soldiers follow orders.
Holy sh!t.  Weird Al now looks just like Billy Conelly!
Al, you are a national treasure. I really hope I get to see you play someday! (Atlantic Canada)  P.S. If you're not already on TikTok, this sort of thing fits there perfectly!
Good soldiers follow orders
reply to this comment (🤞)
Thanks for gracing the Berkshires with your presence last month Al!!
Al is aging well
Lol
LOL  leave it to you!
Love this guy!
Big if true
What a sheep  (Please dont flame me I'm only kidding)
Mr. Obvious.
Hey Al, I'm the one who wrote Hammertime on the bottom of all the Stop signs, sorry if it slowed down your commute.
Charles Manson is that you?
Why do some people get to age so gracefully? It's really not fair.
thats Weird ...
I needed this today.
This 12 second video has over 800k views in a week. That’s the power of Weird Al.
gotta love that man i recognized him instantly.
Nice²
OMG I love you,  Al!!!!💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Deep sksksk
A man who can get thousands of views from a simple 12 second video. How do you do what you do, Al? 😄
You understood the assignment... If this was on tt.
Somewhere in the deep recesses of my brain when I think of Weird Al I think of late night showings of UHF on the USA Network during the 90s...
That's what they all said at Nuremberg...
That was a very wholesome smile
He’s just following orders
Imagine if he comes across a sign that says "Stop"
YOUR HAIR! go off king
Do what you do...Dare to be Stupid!
Weird Al is such a jerk... I met him one time, and he smiled at me, shook my hand, and told me that if I work hard, and never give up, I could accomplish my goals, and that as a fellow human being, I have Inherent value that isn't based on my accomplishments or monetary worth... What a bully...
Was expecting a parody of all the cops and military world wide who are "just following orders" right now.
He almost looks 40 now...
"She'll get over Weird Al. It's just a phase." - My Mom 2012  Well it's 2021, I'm a grown adult and I still find this man absolutely delightful. Interests come and go but Al is forever.
I love that you’re still a dorkus. 😆❤️
Weird Al is a national treasure.
Wasn't that the advice given in the '80s for if a nuclear bomb goes off?
I am now subscribed to this channel
Oh Al you weird weird man!! Lol 😂!
I do so love this man. He makes me smile.
The immortality spells deteriorating
It did catch up to him. Doesn't matter though, this man is a treasure.
Hello, Al! Hope to see you play Summerfest again someday!
lol :-P
The musical god himself wow looking great Al!
Dad Al jokes!
I hope he’s living the best life
How can anyone dislike Weird Al? He's like the nicest person ever.
I'd be spending most my life, depressed, if it wasn't for Armish Paradise.  *Thank You Al*
what is wrong with this video ... ?
Al... you got me with this one. Nice!
Come on Weird Al. That's not the HiFi level of comedy I know you're capable of. That's a bad dad joke. And not in a good way. Still love ya and glad to know you're on YT.
Thanks for being such an awesome part of my childhood
Ah, THIS is what Charles Manson meant
No way
I love this man
Man I'm glad I subscribed to him haha, just seeing stuff like this makes my morning better
I found a UHF dvd the other day in the bargain bin. I felt like I won the lottery. Keep it up Weird Al, love ya man!
Saying (EVERYTHING) without uttering a single syllable.  Well played good sir, well played.
Russell Brand and you look the same now.
Al for president!
🛑👀👋
I thought it was Billy Connolly for a second.
He brought back the ‘stache
The way he smiles is just so 😍
Al on his way to see his favourite band: The White Stripes
Good lord, this man does not age.
Needed the Oblivion NPC Soundtrack for This 😂
Al has morphed into a 90s Billy Connolly 😅
that's why i like food at restaurants. bc it follows orders.
Good soldiers follow orders.
Science has gone too far…
You're the king!
Holy crap, thought it was an old video of Billy Connolly for a second there! :O
Hope I look that good at 60
for a couple of seconds I thought it was Nick Cage...
Look Wave must be stopped!
Hey Al, want to make a song together?❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🌸🌸💖💖💗💗🌸🌸🌸🌸🙏💜💙💚💛🧡🙏🌸🌸🌸🌸💗💗💖💖🌸🌸❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I've been having this video in my top left recommendations FOR DAYS and didn't see a reason to watch it, now that I watched it I really wonder why youtube so desperately wanted me to watch this, it's literally random comedy.
This feels like a gus johnson video, just generic shitpost stuff, but it's so surreal that it's weird al
Anyone know where this is? It's pretty!
al at nurumberg what he gonna do
Good soldiers follow orders, good soldiers follow orders...
Good AI follows orders
Robert Plant has a great sense of humour!
Unironically love this guy.
Billy Connelly is still funny as hell.
That's a beautiful church behind you.
That was so Charles Manson when asked him "tell me who you are"
Hey Al ...[waves back].
You made my childhood  & you still a funny guy
Acting skiLLZ.
Just weird Al being being weird and we love it.
I met Mr. Y at a K-Mart in Palmdale CA. Looked him in the eye and gave him a lesson in spelling, "It's I before E, except as in weird".  He nodded and replied, "You're damn right."
We miss you
wholesome malicious compliance :)
You should do another brilliant song about this subject of following government orders...  🏎️Let's go Brandon 💨 https://youtu.be/X0dELkK7W_A
yes
.... so would this be the song or the music video of Radiohead's "Just" following orders?
"stop look wave"  "good soldiers follow orders"
Truly superb
POLKA! POLKA! POLKA!!!!!
Let's Go Brandon!!!!
You never seize to amaze me🤣
Lets go Brandon !!
al your allready weird don't ruin that,what this world needs is you,ranking on it.not following it.peace man I've been living all my life in a amish paradise,even azikall thinks my mind is gone.
King is back, baby!
😂😂😂😂 I love this man
FCJHLB  #POOPGATE
Hey Al!
Dare to be Stupid
This is what I'll remember when I get drafted into Vietnam 2. Yes sarge, I will burn the civilian village to cinders
Wow, didn't even know this channel existed.  😳
Al, you are a massive goofball. 😜
Awesome to see you Al
In the summer of 2019 I went to a weird al concert in Sacramento CA and it was the best concert I’ve ever been to!
OH NO HES OLD
I could have sworn this was James LaBrie from Dream Theatre by the thumbnail.
just a law biding citizen
Mmmmm. K
Bless the algorithm
Hey al, stand for something, not just acting like a jackass. You have no mask that’s a start.
So Al, where's your next album?!
I, almost always, have some difficulty obeying the street sign that reads "PARK".
🤦‍♂️
Hi!!!!
Weird Al looks like BIlly Connolly now! They should do a movie where they are twins!
I could see al yankov walking around with a spray can and template putting that message up all over town to make the world a more friendly place
But does that make it right?
kek
lookin like Christopher Lee
All shit no post
Lame
You've served your country well.
Hey isnt that Howard Stern?
What's up, hot dog?
limmy energy
Living up to his name.
Good soldiers follow orders
This dude is the future of old people
This man is a national treasure. <3
Weird al looks like he chould be my long lost uncle
Name of a new album?
If anything, this is underacted.
Good soldiers follow orders
My wife never appreciated that when we’d drive by a Wine and Liquor shop I’d whine and lick her. Never seemed to go over well. 😜
just like the simulations!
Isn't Al starting to look like Billy Connolly, or is it just me?
Just following orders Al?!?!?! What happened to your rebelliousness when you thought about parking there???
I used to hate this guy back when I was like 10. Basically I associated him with immaturity. Over the years the random pieces of information I've learned about him have made me realize he's actually a pretty respectable human being. He apparently started school a year early, then got bumped a year ahead, then finished high school as the valedictorian.
I dont know who this alyan kovic guy is, but he seems pretty cool
"ok dad, that's enough, u are going back to the basement"
This treasure of a man is getting older and I am not okay with it.
Thank you for everything that you do
this Alyan Kovic fella is pretty funny
Weirdo...  but then, I guess that's the general idea...
Kinda like Australian police are "just following orders". Hmmm, where have I heard that excuse before?
That was weird
it's communist!
"Für Ihre Sicherheit." Nuremberg is the only way.
Nuremburg trials say that's not a valid legal defense.
Protect this man at all costs.
I love you, Al
Is that Giuseppe from TGB Baking Show?
What are your supposed to do? I get the stopping and looking, but... waving???
He is old
Aging like a fine wine. ^ ____ ^
al, never change.
Is this Russell Brand's dad?
I love this man
Honestly weird al is the man, just found his channel. Amen!
Getting some serious billy connolly impression feels good sir. Well done. Its like two respectable people in one.
Stop Look Meh
Protect this man at all cost. We need to harvest his mind and upload it to a world wide cloud for eternal safekeeping.
Never stop being you Al. You´ll always be a national treasure!
nOice
That's what the Nazis did.
For a second there, I was concerned this was going to be a Squid Game reference.
Ah yes, ah yes.. VVeird Aal. Your powers are well known to me. Why do you not have a comic book based on you.
Someone gets to drink from the firehose! Oh, please make UHF 2 😄
I meet him in a museum in Manhattan about 10 years ago was such a nice guy..
never change al
Art
He did the wave
I love you man thank you
thank you Al, great video
perfect
this man is truly immune to becoming a boomer
cheered me right up. Thanks Al
Good soldiers follow orders
His hair is still glorious.
Love to see Weird Al anytime, any day, and anywhere.  Anything he does, is spectacular and always unique.  Thanks for a smile, Weird Al ...
lol....shut up
I subscribed because of this.
I need Al and Limmy to get together and just make like 100 random skits, and then slowly post them over the course of the next few years as unexpected little treats.
Looking like Kenny G.
The thing I'm most proud of? Sharing a birthday with Weird Al!
Why does no one notice that Weird Al is Matt Colbo's father
:)
Wholesome. Just pure wholesomeness.
Weird Al looks and acts like my dad. I love it so much.
Weird Al is there any chance you could do a dedication to Packzis?  Maybe rap, death metal maybe mix them together or hell do Bardcore if you really want to throw people?  I just discovered that genre and boy is it fun.
Uncle Monty looking good these days   In all seriousness though you're a special guy Al, more posts please 👍
Let's get Weird!
Good Gentile....
No more ideas for new songs?
Weird al is the weird uncle that I want
Wait a minute. That's not Weird AL. That's Billy Connoly!
You're a treasure, Al. Never change.
As long as we have Weird Al, we will always have a ray of light to cut through the darkness.
NO U TURN
Baris Mancho has some fun in retirement. Probably from visiting Tupac jjust before
Faca
62 years old, grey in his hair, wrinkles on his face... and yet somehow it feels like he hasn't aged a day!
Very important.
That was.... weird.
And I was thinking it was going to be a commentary on policing in America.
Probably how Monty Python started.
crazy how much this guy looks like Weird Al.
About a week and a half ago, while in Albuquerque (yup... that one)  I used your music to help guide sheriff's dept people to me, because the trail I was hiking up was unusually confusing, and I'd been going in circles for 4 hours.  When I finally managed to show them where I was via laser, I used everything I have in my library to guide them, especially when my voice gave out 2 minutes in.  The irony of playing your stuff, while NOT having that song in my playlist was not lost on me.   And then found out the way out was 15 feet away but hidden in the bushes. D:
That was just weird Al Yankovic
It's great seeing you again! I grew up with all your popular parody's.
Oh no. You've got greys. I hope you're doing well, Al. I love you. Take care.
Just like our brave police.
This feels just like a Rocco Botte bit
Hahahahahaha
Just following orders 😏
you old
Genius.  I get the stop & look - but the wave?
Al.  Love ya buddy.
Better than:    Stop Look Execute
Billy Connolly??
Who in the hell is Allan Kovik?
You better be following proto brother.
Good to see you again
Mr Muscle??
I must say he was one of my Top 5 most played growing up. I LOVED his music!
Make a sequel to UHF!
Fun fact: Weird al appears in the Eric Andre show once so he could say “my work here is done” at the end. The appearance and what he said is completely detached from the entire episode.
Let’s go Brandon
..and that's how Nazi accidents
Amazing.
That Road Is A Tough Nut
Ja ve vere just folloving ze orders
HAAAA! Love you, Al.
OMG..  so simple and funny!!   lol
The last time I heard this excuse was 1945...
It can't be denied now. As we age especially, you, me, and my dad look very much alike. Our Grandpa was Tha mutha fuggin Man, Dawg!
Who are the 424 imbeciles who down voted...time to go medieval on their hineys!
I was hoping for 5 to 10 mins of stand up from the great Tim Thomerson and all I got was  this olive loaf sandwich. With no mayo.
Russell Brand's father?
Why does Weird Al look like John Cleese?
The world needs another UHF my guy.
Ha wait, he still alive?  Nioce!
Basicly people that took the vaccine
This is a fucking Limmy bit if I've ever seen one
Lol
Weird Al is like the strange janitor of society, nobody knows how he got here all we know is if he leaves everything will fall apart
UHF…. one of the world’s most underrated gems.
Another classic which will inevitably be recommended to millions a decade from now, thank you Al.
Didn't recognize the name and thumbnail at first.  Had me wondering, "Who the hell is Alyan Kovic?"  Glad I decided to click!
if they ever remake lotr al should play saruman :D
Ah, the good old Nuremberg defense.
That's what I do for sure.
This is me walking my 7 year old to school every morning 🤣💕 You should see her when she gets to the “slow” sign 🤦‍♀️
Thank you Al for being you!
He’s turning into Billy Connolly
"What? Weird Al is evolving!" "Congratulations! your Weird Al has evolved into a Billy Connolly!"
Weird al is looking more and more like the lead singer of Dream Theatre. I wish he'd do a song with them, like genius in france. Mix their bands and everything.
You know who else was "just following orders"? The Nazis.
Classic
Legend.
Q:  Name a guy who follows orders. Me:  Weird Al would NOT have been at the top of that list...
Please be in Nuremberg...
Nice
Al, you're a genius and a legend and I love you!
This as "Uploaded 15 years ago" vibes
The 400 some odd people who disliked were the ones who didn't get waved at
He needs to be protected at all costs. He's a straight white male and that makes him at high risk for cancel culture
Is that Billy Connolly?
Lol
Hey weird al! How's Pinkie Pie and lil Cheese?
<3
Never change, Al. Even after all these years, you still bring a smile to my face
Thanks Al, that was a very good use of 12 seconds of my life.
I needed the smile today. Thank you
bring back the orb
Thank you for the laughter and the songs.
somehow his greys just make that hair look even more majestic.
Lmao
Good ol' Al........
I thought this was gonna be a Nuremburg Trials joke, but it's just a bro following the law :)
1weird al smarter than all culltists combined.
It did not say anything about smiling.
The Vine energy on this
Wait till you see ours. "CROSSING IS PROHIBITED, IT WILL CAUSE DEATH" 😁😁😁
*Al Yankovic was just following orders*
Weird Al lookin like unlce Monty from the 2004 Lemony Snicket's A series of unfortunate events. Bet hes even got a reptile room.
Hiya 🎃✨🎈*waves* back at you.Uu  =0) Xo
Thanks so much for all you've done in the entertainment industry!!  Love you and God Bless!!!
outstanding citizen
dunno who this Alyan Kovic guy is but he seems pretty cool :)
Good soldiers follow orders.
Hey Al! Have you taken the magic juice?
A parody of Sicko Mode would be epic, especially for the COVID era.
Al Jankowic sounds like an Arab Yugoslav. Weird guy...
This is the Non-content i've been looking for!
I've forgiven you for yelling at me in Oregon, Al. But I'll never forget it.
The day got a bit better
John Cleese looks different...
You’re one crazy-ass person!  I’m glad you exist cause you sure keep the rest of us from dying of boredom!!😃👍🏽 Stay Cool.🥸😎❤️
This is the most wholesome thing in 2021.
Well done!
Frig Al
I just watched UHF a couple nights ago... I gotta say, Mr. Yankovic... it has HELD UP over the years! Hope you're well!
legend
Billy Connolly?
Much love for a great artist
Weird al reaching is final form of turning into Billy Connely
I thought it was Billy Connelly in the thumbnail 😅
One of my favorite people!
That is why I like you so much bro because you funny. It shows in the parodies you do and day to day life. Laughter is the best medicine, Your comedy is uncanny . I do my best to show humor and make it a part of my hand drawn solvable maze art I do as well. You truly inspire more people than you realize. Peace and Happiness, Matt's Amazing Mazes signing off.
Randomly got this in my feed and didn't realize who it was at first. £uck!ng awesome! Thanks Al! I needed that.
Classic weird al
i was just following orders.. i had no choice...
Vaccines are based on industry funded science.
Amazing. The dumbest joke to make me smile on a rough day. Just like growing up with his music, memorizing all his palindromes and such.
When did Wierd Al get so old looking. I don't like this. Time needs to slow down right now!
Hello, my name is Rajesh Sheikyerbouti. I'm doing research for the essentials of developing photographs of six-foot-wide, eight-and-a-half-foot deep holes in parts of the desert where people who are afraid of scorpions are afraid to talk to each other because they are afraid that the conversation will come to the topic of scorpions, in which case they will become paralysed with fear and fall into the hole, and I'd like to ask you a few questions about that if you have time. Thank you very much!
0:03 Squirrel mode activated
Weird Al is the only reason I'm not a COMPLETE misanthropist. He's proof humans aren't ALL bad.
Thanks for the reminder.  Time to rewatch "UHF"
A living legend
You are my favorite!!!!!
am i the only one who thought this was a younger billy connely at first glance?
Eric Idle and Billy Connolly had a baby!
Goddamit Al, i just burst out laughing in public
Need a new political song from you, to upset the interwebs... "Just following orders" a hint ;) :D
you're the goofiest
?????????
*Good soldiers follow orders.*
I love how when Al stopped he made the Minecraft punch sound.
Needed that!!
Anyone else notice how in the first three seconds he manages to look like one of the great philosophers of our times just by looking up
everyone has an uncle like weird al, I feel like I'm turning into that uncle....
Oh my god he's greying.
Come on Al release a new album the world needs to laugh right now
Al's looking a little greyer here, Not a bad look.
"Still -crazy- weird after all these years..." 🎼🎶🎶🎶🪗
So obedient.  Such a good example.
jewish disliked
I was so confused I thought he was about to get a nice white present from a bird
This man is a treasure
Why does he look like (for lack of better example) look like Wilbur Wonka from the 2004 Tim Burton spin off with longer hair and a shaved beard?  Edit: HOLY FUCK HE'S 62!??!?!??!?!??!?
You're such a dork, and that's why I love you.
The song, "Word Crimes," is great! Keep up the good work!
He's so weird.
bet he won't respond
Sheep.  Always doing whatever Big Asphalt tell him to.
looking almost like sir christopher lee for a second there
Why am I just now discovering that weird all has a youtube channel? 🤔
Weird Al is definitely the only guy from the mainstream entertainment industry who definitely knows how Internet humour works.
Say what you will about this guy, but he is a genius!
He looks like John Cleese nowadays.
“Good soldiers follow orders…” “Good soldiers follow orders…”
is this a political statement?
So happy you seem to be having a good time with life :-)
Great job you did all three things perfectly
Goofball!
holy shit seeing him has made me feel so old
This couldn't have been done any better. 😂👍
Why won't you do a song that makes fun of jews?
wow, such a weird guy
glad you're doing well!
Didn't see that coming
whos this guy Alyan Kovic?
*N O V A K K K S C E N E*
Nuremberg trials be like
Following orders or not, you're still guilty, I mean awesome!
"eats, shoots and leaves" :)
Hell yeah!
Ha!
Lol Cute ! :)
😂😂😂
Heya bud-- I just rewatched UHF as adult the other day, and I gotta say: *_WOW, Mister! Thanks! Thaaanks a looot_*
Cover Marilyn Manson: The beautiful pimple The beautiful pimple Hey you why don't you say please When you tell me to use Sea Breeze Hey you why ya bother me still? I say I ain't using Clearasil The beautiful pimple  The beautiful pimple  Ahhhhhh
The moustache is slowly returning to us.  Soon. Soooon...
I order you to get a haircut.
I don't have a comment to match the eloquence of anybody who has posted already.  Been a fan of Al since about 1990.  This video made my day and cheered me up.
I never realized how much Weird Al looks like a long haired version of Bruce Campbell! Or maybe Bruce Campbell looks like a short haired Weird Al.
Who made you my laugh master? LOL! XD
If I had not read the comments I would have never thought this was Weird Al. Where the hell has he been since forever?!
Al going for the Billy Connolly look, nice.
Al look more like Eric Idle every day!
good soldiers follow orders
I miss short videos in landscape orientation.
Never change, man.
<3
Can I order the Jesuit sandwich with a side of get out of global population control by being exempt from normal people shit. Thanks
Al you are an American treasure.
I hope this starts a trend.
Good
Much needed today! Happy Halloween everyone 🎃
He did 100% of the instructions but the instructions did not include "smile" so I have to deduct 7%. Thus I have to grade him at 93%
good grief this man is wholesome
Reminds me of the “Watch Children” signs…as an older man, I always wondered how long it would take for the cops to show up if I just pulled over and did what the sign says.
legendary wave
Man, I was just talking about Al the other day. Around 34 years ago I had a friend that looked just like Al. We actually called him "Weird Al". He drove this beat up Chevette, and it reminded me of the car George Newman(Al's character from UHF) used to drive around. Small, cramped, but it got you where you needed to be.    When Al did a parody of one of your songs, you knew that you truly made it in the music world.  Thank you Al, for decades... for everything.
Were you in Amish country, churnin' lots of butter?
He was just following orders just like Thomas the Tank Engine during the Second World War.
This man is legend
It's not the porn stache but it'll do.
Sure *you* say you were "just following orders" and everyone laughs. But when *I* say it and I'm still convicted for war crimes.
Lol
*waves back*
Weird Al, you're my fairy godfather. I thought you should know.
You're weird, Al.
ahahaha what the world needs.
:O What a socialist.
Thats a nice.. Whoa dude when did you get old???
I thought this was a nazi joke
I don’t know what related me to get this video, but I appreciate it.
He is so funny.
that was pretty weird, Al
Nailed it.
Before memes came, Al was the Master Memer.
He is a real life Oblivion character
👋
“I’ve been at the mercy of men just following orders.”
This Al fellow is kinda weird...
I never thought I would see the day where Al would begin to actually grey.
Genius
The world needs more Weird Al because everyday more and more people lose their sense of humor!
I get it!!
this made me smile, thanks AL : )
Also the title of a lesser known sequel to "Eat Pray Love"
And here I was thinking this was gonna be a reference to the Holocaust. My expectations were WAY off.
Ahahaha
Hi Al! Glad to see you!
Hey Al. I'm a big fan of yours. I really like your music. I wish there was more artist like you. I have your cd called Mandatory Fun. When are you coming out with another album.
It is truly nice to know that in a world that changes so much, Al is still Al. Bless you, Al.
It never said smile!!! HE VIOLATED THE LAW
That's was shot one town away from me. I wish I'd known he'd be in the area.
You know, thats exactly what the population of nazi-Germany did, ‘just follow orders’… and now we have the state of Israel! Shalom!
I love that Weird Al doesn't touch up his hair. I also love that he has hair to not touch up.
I thought this video was like order 66
Good Soldier
You gotta love Al, and the joy he brings wherever he goes.
BRO HES IN MY HOMETOWN
Al isn't weird, the hole world is weird, Al is just a normal person doing normal stuff just for us to feel better!
Kaiser Wilhelm put his helm on "Now there is War" Frenchy king but his helm on: Non dérisoir
That reminded me of an interview I saw with Charlie Manson...
I don't get it.
I love this
*OBEY*
The maniac loves ya!!
Reading upside-down text with such ease, truly masterpiece.
Weird al is the crazy uncle we all want to have.
Awesome Al is also fitting
sweet
Alyan Kovic bears a striking resemblance to Weird Al Yancovic, circa 1983.
I thought for sure this was gonna be covid related for some reason??
*Weird Al at the Nuremberg Trials, 1945, colourized*
Don’t ever change, Al
Oh no I've been doing this the whole time and just realised how weird it actually looks.
In Wales eventing is bilingual and I have to tell you, as a Welsh speaking, doing everything twice is a real pain.
Woah! Weird Al is on YouTube? I better search if Peewee Herman is on here as well.
Weird Al is a treasure.
me trying to follow "the science" about covid
Will there ever be another Weird Al movie?   UHF is in my all time top 10 favorites
The Mark of the Beast!
Rain Man
*AL YANKOVIC - NO PARTY/INDEPENDENT FOR PRESIDENT 2024* The "Right" way didn't work, the "Left" way isn't working...  I say... it's time for the *WEIRD AL WAY!!!*
Comedic genus at in it's purest form.
He's starting to look a little like John Cleese
I love Al so much
"Stop Look Wave" because you have the right of passage?  In the Netherlands you have that right and when they don't give it you call them 1 of the insane amounts of swearwords we have. You deserve that right!
Did anyone else see the title and automatically assume this was going to be commentary on mask mandates?
YoooooO!
Thanks For Al!
you know hitler was just following orders as well smh
HE'S BACK
GOD
Is this in Canadia?
He's definitely starting to age, but its not bad considering how he's looked 25 for the past 30 years.
Damn otizee.  Great Gag and traffic safety too...
GOAT
Al. Weird Al 🙋‍♀️Yankovic.  !! Where there you are!🙋‍♂️ my hero.
Hmmm, does this mean we'll soon hear a song about this? 😉 (thinks of origin of Word Crimes)
Just be thankful he isn't on a mission to hunt down some guy named Look Wave.
The Albatross massages the porpoise with cheese.
Al, I love you man! And not in that prison sort of way.  Thank you for blessing my childhood with great humor and being respectful in the process.
Hahahahaha
Hi!👋👋👋👋
Dude is underrated...
He who is tired of weird Al is tired of life.
I am so glad I found this I needed to laugh.
This is the first time I've noticed Al look slightly older in like 30 years. Not a knock against the guy, either. Kind of the opposite. 'Was starting to get suspicious...
I love how much of a goof this beautiful man is
Good one :D
UHF was amazing.... make more movies AL !
I think we all need another album after the last few years.
Your weird...
Pure genius.
Good soilders follow orders
We were just talking about you at dinner last night, Al. We miss you. Please come back to Illinoiz.
AI is good!
hes just following orders
You just watched this video. Congrats! Your algorithm is now screwed.
Still kickin I see
You just made my day better. Thank you. :)
😂😂😂😂😂 the ultimate GOAT 🐐😁
xd 😆
I like to think there’s a CIA car that drives over that crosswalk all day, running over the people who don’t wave.
"He who is tired of Weird Al, is tired of life." -Homer Simpson, 2008
ok
The cool old man 😎
Happy birthday!
I didn't even know weird Al was out and about. When I was a kid I loved his music. Seems like a cool dude.
"stop look wave"? I've never seen that before. What does that even mean? He should have been with a group of people. Then, they all stop and look, then do a stadium-style wave.
The ultimate memelord is finally activating super sayain mode
It's like Al didn't age a day for 40 years and then aged 40 years in a day.
No one: My great grandpa when he was in court:
Love it, Mr. Yankovic!  (Waves back)
He's giving off strong grandpa vibes
This man’s “Dad Joke” ability is too strong. He must be stopped 👮🏻‍♂️
that was al the funniest thing i've seen in some time THANKS and PLEASE return to san jose california sometime soon. i loved seeing tacky live.
Oh man, I'm ready for grandpa Al.
You sir...Are indeed THE Man.
Stupid day for me today... I see the video, read the channel name as alyan kovic and wonder, who the h*** did I subscribe too? And when??? Thanks Al, good to see you.
Epic
hahahahaha oh that's funny still as goofy as ever
When I was a kid, my dad looked like Kevin Nash. Now I'm an adult and my dad looks like Weird Al.
Yes another Al video. He needs to embrace the fact that he is one of the king of YouTube
I thought this was going to be about enforcing masks and vaccines.
this video is weird but strangely enough, I like it thumbs up
This guy has been entertaining me as long as he's been working, damn I'm old
The Myth, The Legend, The Hair!
I'll be honest, at first I thought it was Billy Connolly heading towards me =o
Stop getting older. It makes me feel old, too.
This man is a true professional.
😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭
How dare he. Now it’s time to argue politics.
Even in advanced age he’s still got it and is funny!
love to see the man
The Stache is Back
We love you Al - never stop doing what you do
Hope you're doing well Al and enjoying life.
62 years old and still making the world smile and laugh.
My dumbass: *stops in traffic, looks at oncoming car, waves at the frightened driver*
Al's humor is like a Dorito chip. It never gets stale.  EDIT: I accidentally put Cunningham's law in practice by making this comment about Doritos.
never stop daring to be stupid
Look at this goose, carrying on like a pork sausage!!!!!
I have to watch this multiple times every time YouTube suggests it and it keeps suggesting it. Help, I'm trapped in cuteness.
This man needs to be protected at all costs
Never knew Al was a good soldier. (The Clone Wars reference)
Can’t stand this dude. P U
This made my day! Thank you Al! 😁
Awesome
You're awesome Al I've been listening to you from the beginning  Never forget to Dare to be stupid
The 266 dislikes were from traffic wardens.
This got me. 😂
Just glad you're alive man.
Don’t do it
Yep. Still funny.
A national treasure.
Uhhhh my son dressed up as Weird Al for Halloween this year my friends.
thanks, Al. Hope you don't catch the Shanghai Surprise, the pooh flu, or whatever it gets called next. be safe and be well
Good soldiers follow orders.
Good soldiers follow orders
you forgot your mask and your vaccine papers.. And being Jewish, you might want to add the vaccine arm band too.. lol... I mean, just following orders.... lol
What a dufus   👍😁
Man when you gonna take me too "spatula City"
Hey it's odd Allen!
That is so al.
Plot twist: Al was on his way to a Billy Connolly lookalike contest
Let's Go Brandon!
Please live forever sir!!!!!
Hahahahah
Al, you are the best.
The orb wielder strikes once again
Only Weird Al could get away with this
Love it.
I have to admit since I didn't see it was Weird Al I expected a darker joke
hey buddy
Never change you are too pure
laugh.comment.subscribed.
Just following orders, eh?? That was his same excuse when building that IKEA table!! Who’s going to explain to the children what a MELLTORP is????? Who AL??? WHO???
WTH? it took me a full 5 sec to recognize Weird Al. He age so well.
You know that stopped being an excuse during the Nuremberg trials, right?
Next, tackle the crossing lights.  Some of them (like the one up at Clark) have buttons you can’t get to with out leaning far enough to fall over…..
Is it me or is this guy kinda weird?
For a guy his age, he has great hair!
A man of the people!
Al is seriously one of the best people alive right now. I got to meet him back in 2017 and he is just as awesome in person as he is here. I've been listening to him since I was 9 and I will ALWAYS love him. Al, keep doing you. That's an order!
This dude is Micheal Myers. He just keeps coming back
Our king
bruh this was just uploaded
That's right, it's your fault if you get hit by a car!
Thank God for Weird Al! He is a national treasure.
🤣🤣🤣
Alfred Yankovic. The man who made a career out of being a professional goober.  (Before Ryan Reynolds)
Anyone else think he's starting to look a lot like Zappa?
I remember 'discovering" Weird Al Yankovic 30 years ago and excitedly trying to 'explain' him to my parents. Who were all like, "Yea duh, he's awesome." And now, even to this day, Weird Al is immersed in today's zeitgeist, "shitposting" in the highest quality way.
The man, The myth, The Legend Weird Al Yankovic is shitposting
How did I not know about your channel? How did the algorithm know I needed to know?
International treasure. Weird Al Yankovic
hey al
Remember Peewee Herman? Well guess who I saw singing with him last night. Weird Al. https://youtu.be/QdBU64Fye2Y
More entertaining than a hour of scrolling on Tiktok
kinda looks like Gallagher with that mustache
i love u al
- - waves back - -
You really got me with that title. I thought this was going to be a joke about how authoritarian the governments of the "free" world have gotten over the virus. "Oh my god he's not wearing a mask!" *cue body convulsions*
Weird Al is a genius.
Al. You have shaped my personality as if you were a big brother or uncle or a beloved gold fish that had all the right answers . THANK YOU.
I'm glad Al is Weird. It would have been so much less fun all these years, to be a fan of Normal Al.
Yup. I'd do the same thing. But no one would care if I did it. **L** Love seeing one of my favourite humans!
Absolute chad
I can't help it. You will always be Weird to me.
OMG, best video since White & Nerdy!
Yikes on bikes. It's weirdly comforting that this guy has been hilarious since before I was born, and he's still a top jokester even after my own kid is born now. All hail Al. Mandatory
Much love post 2001
When the world most needs him, he comes back
God you have aged like fine wine my friend❤
That was weird
Weird Al is not the hero we need; He’s the one we have deserved.
Do not comply, resist. 😂
Looking good, man.
The world has gone bananas that al isn’t weird anymore.   Yes.
Wow, it's James LaBrie!
@Alyankovic, is this in Western Mass? It looks like a city up the road from me!
Excellent.
Dear Al, Thank you for turning me on to how fun writing philks are. One love.  .E.
He dated Nicholette Larson for a time.  Great singer.
I'm surprised the alphabet and other nut-job liberal groups haven't attacked Al  and his work yet.
simple but effective ^ç^
Not at all what I was expecting. Not at all disappointed.
XD
Rotfl
Not just funny, relevant. Kudos
Beautiful smile
Wow, youtube algorithm brought me here, i was like "who the heck is alyan kovic?".."he kinda looks like weird Al Yan..." yup, definitely read the name wrong
Well that's my dose of wholesome for the day. Thanks Al. Stay weird.
I thought he was Eric Idle.
Still one of the funniest men alive.
fantastic shitpost
Hi Al!!!
Williams College
At 0:00 spoiler
I thought this was an album announcement but no Al is just a really funny guy
Nice!
We need a UHF sequel that deals with how the UHF channel fights to survive during the takeover of streaming platforms.
🎃
youtube must love you Al because this is the 12th time i got this video in my recommendations.
🤣🤣🤣
It didn't say smile. A true rebel at heart.
God I love this man!
That make my day😁👋
looking great
I'm gonna die of old age, hopefully, and this guy is still gonna be hopping around like a teenager lol.
Hi
Stay weird, Al
Little did he know the road was trying to warn him of an incoming Tsunami
K but can we appreciate how this guy doesn’t post for week, probably doing whatever weird al does, and then just randomly posts things like this… <3
I waved back at the screen
"Good pedestrians follow orders"
Galliger meets Jello Biafra?
I thought a Karen would cancel the crap out of him for not wearing a mask.
A god among men
Well I did Nazi that coming!
Still the man.
I thought it would be making fun of Nazi for some reason cause the common solider excuse was "I was just following orders."
If Weird Al is doing a show near you, make sure you go. It’s amazing to see him perform live.
DO NOT COMPLY! LOL
Not the anti-covid restriction satire I was hoping for.
This isn't shitposting. This is funposting.
This was great haha
Best song hes released today. On this specific day. Which is today.
I just want to remind everyone that this whole guy’s existence is a Jojo reference
Weird Al is a god
This is funny because the writing on the stop walk was referring to the proper way to cross a street, and was not meant to be taken literally in any other context, but it was not written that it should not be taken literally. This prompted him to follow the steps in a literal manner out of context. Also adding humor to the situation were the exaggerated facial expressions he made during said demonstration of being literal
king
Good job making it to my recommendations page and I have my history turned off and no liked videos to give any algorithms a reason to put it there
im black too
In an age of all that is wrong with society, we have a breath of fresh Al Yankovic.
Weird Al, the fun uncle of the internet
My first cassette was this man's music.   Thank you sir
ribbit
I'm at this uncomfortable stage in life where all of my childhood heroes are starting to look old.
I love you so much Al.
Beautiful birthday present from one of my heroes. You have reminded me my whole life that being weird is not only okay, it's cool. For that I say thank you, Al
hi
Looking good dude
anyone else recognize the street? Its Spring Street in Williamstown, MA where Williams College is. Go ephs! Also I have always loved and been inspired by your music, passion, and joy, so thank you my good sir.
This is hilarious!
Better than Brando! I smell Oscar!!!
You’ve aged spectacularly, don’t look a day over 50,
OMG! He finally aged a few days...
This has been the greatest eleven seconds of my life. Thanks Al. (55 actually; I watched it five times.)
It's the simple things in life you treasure.
hahaha As only Weird Al can do!
He's gotten older but still funny as hell
Anyone else notice how he and Billy Connolly are morphing into one?
To see him with gyno now is kinda sad🤣
The OG Memester before memes were thought of
Wow he waved his hand cause he read the sign. Thats hilarious! This is by far the best thing thats ever existed, is better than 101% of all the content on the internet and is so relevant. So glad I just saw the funniest most creative video Ive ever seen.  Fantastic. Theres nothing like this and never will be! This is pure original comedy at its finest.   Nobody has ever read a sign and sarcastically done what it said in a different context. This is new stuff, and should be appreciated as such.
😆
Al was this at Bryn Athyn Church in Pennsylvania?
♥
That's a great video Al! Thanks for sharing.
He's so old now
So when will we be getting UHF 3?
Weird Al forever
I feel completely and totally safe in predicting this man will live an incredibly long life and will die entertaining a roomful of fans who will feel blessed to simply have been allowed to attend. 👻👻👻
when the legend weird al is in his 60s AND still do it  better
😁
I want another CD ! Please!!!??? 😢
thank you al. very cool!
The title made me think this would be a divisive political statement.   Now I feel like I got trolled, but I'm okay with it.
The Nuremburg Trials
...Dammit Al XD
Weird Al is among those artists that I respect as a human first and then also as an artist.  Love you man.  ❤❤
The background looks a lot like the UK but I don’t know if there are any road crossings like that there.
Oh
Love him!
Before the pandemic I met him. He's a really good honest down to earth person!!
Wish Al would play a multiverse version of Dr Strange
11 seconds to sum up the state of mind of most of society today? Weird Al -I got this.
The world needs a new Weird Al Album
Not going to lie, with a video title like that, I was expecting something serious or profound. This was a pleasant surprise.
I love how he can take something so ordinary and turn it into pure comedy! 😂😂😂
🤣 Love you AL.
Man got a chortle outta me and he didn’t even say a word. Gotta love Al.
He's still got it 😂
National Treasure!
Mission Complete...come on home.
Miss his music and touring. Maybe both will make a comeback in 2022?
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
u da king, baby!
This guy looks a lot like Weird Al's dad
!!!!!
Thank you, sir with blessing us with your brief return.
Weird Al is what the world is missing right now. He's the healing we all need.
Wtf, since when did he get this old
The Terminator disappointed me with "Screw Your Freedom" ... lol The U Can't C Me PUPPET disappointed EVERYONE, lmao Mr Weird ... Never disappoints.
One of my childhood heroes. I use to parody every song i heard after hearing "my bologna" back in the 80s. Love you Loco AL 😜
James LaBrie from Dream Theater is looking really well these days!
🛑 👀 👋 ? OR 🛑 👀  🌊 ?
Good soldiers follow orders
🤣🤣🤣
Al might age, but he remains fresh!
Good soldiers follow orders.
Truly a national treasure. 🤗
Al, please come to Alaska???
He should read between the lines...
If you don't like Al, then you don't like fun.
😎💖😎 ... ... ... 🎁
So utterly pleasant.
What a legend
The chosen one has returned.
The original Meme lord!
So proud Weird Al was present when I proposed to the woman that would not end up becoming my wife. It is probably the only time someone has cherished a failed marriage proposal. :p (She said yes at the time, but then broke it off a month or so later.)
Ya' startin' to look like Bruce Dern mate.
I honestly thought this was gonna be a new album announcement haha
"OK, BOOMER!"
You're still the best, Al.
I'm loving this new comedy special. I love Weird Al and I hate commercials, so this is a double win for me!
Just the thing I feel he would share with us..
Torllicious.
Who are the 199 A Holes who downvoted this???????????
I hope you're going on  tour again someday. I've had a really hard 2 yeats. I really want to see you again! I love you!
Can you remake the movie “the room” with your own take on it
I've always said there are few celebrities I'd fan girl over, Weird Al is one of the very few.  The man, the legend.
well well well.......that will be 5.82
Mmmhmm.
Thanks for stopping by to wave at me! The world is a more awesome funnier place with you in it.
this came up on my social feeds because this is my college town but LOL
I hate this kind of comedy coming from anyone else. I don't know how you do it.
Best Human
Never thought I’d see Just following orders
Comedy thy name is 'Weird Al'!😛😛😛😛😛😛😛😛😛😛😛😛😛😛👍
Holy shit, Weird Al finally aged! He looks a decade older...than he did in the 80s!
Wow you have been doing this for so long
I would love to see this guy in a movie 🍿 again
I laughed so hard. Weird Al is the best thing ever. Anytime I see him I smile but this cracked me up almost as much as Rocky road 😅
This is disappointing. I was hoping for a new song! Randy Rainbow is leaving you in the dust!
Australia.
He looks so...different?
Stop, drop & roll daddio.😉
i'm a grinky binkus
hahahahahaha!
in the end he is not weird but just a kind human
Hey Al, when are you going to record "Bat Snack Fever"? I'm sure Ted Nugent won't mind a bit. He seems mentally stable enough for a parody.
There's more to Weird Al than meets the eye. Silly and wholesome, yes, but there are deep layers of decency, humility and courage to escape the judgement and scorn of not conforming. Weird Al speaks to those of us who dare to be ourselves.
Supliessssss!
looking good king
Okay, stop and look is understandable....But why wave?? 🤔 🤷‍♂️
The best laugh I’ve had so thing silly in a long time. Thanks Al !
Woah he posted a video.
What a delightful person.
His game and fortune did not corrupt him..he is solid.
Thank you for being you sir.
Geez, I'm glad it didn't say "Speed Hump".
Amazing ♥
Nice! 😁
Can I tell my kids Al waved at me?
Well, you made me laugh.
Hello Al.
We don't deserve Al
This guy always manages to make me laugh
I think this is the first time I genuinely smiled today.  Thanks, Al!  <3
So dumb... That's why I love it.
I can't tolerate this.
The legendary mustache has returned.. what does this mean..  Only if he told us..
Is this at virginia tech?
Weird Al, Bob Ross, Mr Rogers, Levar Burton, all bring us such joy and happiness. Thank you for all you've done for us!
I think this is the first time I've seen Al visibly aged even a tiny bit since the mid-80s.
What an icon
My middle school teacher always told us a story of how she was a backup dancer for weird al and while he was jumping up and down he got his sweat all over her
😂😂😂
*waving back*
👋🏽
Ah man. I thought this was a new song.
Damnit I love you Al!
This man is a beacon of delight in a miserable world.
The man. The myth. The legend. Long live Weird Al Yankovic
Good times.
The Return of The King
lol always seeing the funny side of reallty and pointing it out always funny thanks for the laugh
Seriously Looking Whoopee! 🤣🤣🤣
Can you tell your daughter to stop making our movement worse?
Hey man just curious can you speak Slovene ?
Anyone ever think Al looks like a nicer James LaBrie? Like James LaBrie and Mr Rogers had a kid?
Wow. You look different since I last saw you lol, no offense.
Literally 98% of people under the great Cornholio2019.
I'm digging the Billy Connolly goatee.
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
At first when Al is crossing the street he's starting to look a little like Billy Connolly! (when he was younger)
lol
Cheese Sandwich
So simple a gesture, yet so soothing <3
like good soldiers......
Hahaha
Wonderful. Al, please never stop being everything and anything you wanna be. You are a wonderful person. Even something as small as taking a few words and acting upon them without having to think about it makes my day just that much better! I can't wait to continue hearing from you, even in the smallest ways you can think of.
what a madlad XD.
weird al is a cool guy
Still so cool!
Been a fan since I was a kid. Cool dude.
lol, nice.
Al yankovic is still runnin wild, brother👻👻
The king forgot his crown!! 👑
That's a good one!
So I guess we know Nina goes to Williams? Smart gal.
You can't deny it, He's just following orders
So, you took a left at Albuquerque.
I think it speaks volumes that Al has 2 million subscribers and Russel Brand has 4 million.   INFORMATION OVER COMEDY.  Regardless of how "funny" that stupidity is. There are more important things going on. This is a distraction.
My dad met this man in a parking lot
🤣👏🏼😂🤣👏🏼😂
Legend
Haha
Thank you Al :D
Your looking good and the sense of humour is so needed, to be silly, just for the giggles.
Thanks, Al.
Starting to look like Christopher Lee in your old age!
Long live the king
Roman 13 (11 to 14 Google
no hard feelings
What a glorious creature
Moments of confusion followed by genuine belly laugh. I love it!
love you Al. ya crazy
Watching this I thought to myself how much Al reminds me of Billy Connelly with this look.... Now I want a Billy & Al colab...
We need to stop the look wave that's spreading throughout the world!
After Years Y stole 2 Michael Jackson songs and other like ridin dirty and other song that I don't know I forgot but ANYWAY STOP STEALING OTHER SONGS FROM OTHER SINGER'S
Now this is a great example of aging gracefully.
I thought this going in a very different direction - a much more German one. *phew*
For a second I was worried this was gonna be a Nuremberg Trial joke. Boy was I in for a surprise.
Anyone else waved at Al when he waved in the video, or was it just me?
You guys don't get it
Welcome Back, Al!
This guy was a grown ass man when I was a young kid. Now, I'm damn near 40. This dude hasn't aged! What the hell is goin on?!
Dad joke? More like _rad_ joke
Love
To all the people who think those that don’t take the vaccine are second class citizens and should lose there job. Just keep following orders. Robots. Lol. Good stuff Weird Al.
How does Weird Al stay fresh? I am pretty sure it's the aluminum foil. Foil. Foil. Foil.
This man is a blessing to the world
Wow that guy looks an awful lot like famous comedian and musical artist Al Yankovic. Anyway funny video guy
The man himself
Huh... Sorta thought he was going for a mask joke there
Looking more and more like Sir Christopher Lee
I thought he could see my mouse going around on my screen.
Lol good one hope your doing good nice to see you out and about
Thanks, Al.
And again just nailed it. He's the best lol
Glad to see there is still humor out there.
Al you're the greatest.
'Roight m8 god save tha queen
Weird yes, funny no. This Guy has Never made me laugh. Just like Carrot Top. Cringe to the Max.
Im voice actor of Milo
That was "Weird"
good soldiers follow orders. great ones question them
I love this guy, how could you not?
It would mean so much to meet this man and thank him for making my childhood FUN watching his videos and TV show and his movie my mom was a huge fan she would have loved to meet this man no award fits him they're not good enough.
oh, you !
Why did Weird Al Yankovic cross the road?  How the hell should I know. I don't know him personally. Maybe he's going to get some ice cream.
I love that he just used his giant music channel to make a shitpost
I assume the instructions are related to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA89V55ZCxE
Happy belated Al!
Weird Al makes me smile.  I'm so glad to see him out and about :)
🎼🤟♥️♥️♥️🤟🎼 Looove Weird Al
One of the greatest singer song writers ever..
we will build a statue to his hair so that generations of the future can see his glory
Thank you for the smile that gave me!
Good one!😀😁
Good sheep
I still remember this legend
Maybe there won't be a Nuremberg trials this time. I certainly hope there is a trial but I'm sure it won't be for the world's criminal class.
It didn't say to smile.
I laughed a lot harder than I should.  With any other person it would have been a meh joke but Al's delivery is perfect as always
I wave like this to everyone on the streets if we know each other at all. Even 5 minutes. See you again. Later.... 🖑🖐🖑🖐🖑🖐🖑🖐🖑🖐🖑
Can you come to Nebraska pleaseeeee
Hey!! iam waving a small flag, that says " NO ONE is going to tell me what to do!!!  then i died....
Why does Billy Connolly look all happy?
Billy Connelly body double
He did follow the rules...
What a legend
In a single moment with the dark spot on your trimmed mustache... you looked like a very confused hitler. 😄
Weird Al would be great on tiktok 😉😉
Nice one :)
The man with the second-most songs on my phone (after Prince, of course). Keep it going, Al!  So sorry I never got to hear your Bonanza-themed take off on "Hot Thing" with "Hop Sing."
Oh you crazy Al!
#WeirdAl4President
He did it. He made the joke. What a leg end
GOOD JOB AL-go-Rhythm ! just yesterday I was wondering how you were doing  (quietly, to myself, in my head) and here you are. ... nice stoic billy connolly "look" you had there glad to see you hale and hearty.
Is he doing good or doing well?
And here I thought he was gonna get political
This made me laugh way more than it should have.
This is the man that got me into music when I was a kid, and to this day, is still my favorite artist. In part, he has inspired some of the more wacky elements in my own creations, and I can not thank him enough. So Thank you Al, from the bottom of my 16-Bit Heart!!!
This made my heart sing. 🥰💖
You never change Al, no matter what, we love you man ❤️
You are so awesome and weird keep on being what you are nuts.
Great job on the Look portion of the Strolling Challenge.
He's starting to look like Billy Connolly.
Still the best hair in music
Good soldiers follow orders.
The lack of punctuation would have got me ran over
Such a lovable goofball.
Amazing as always
🛑       👀           👋🏻
Weird al looks like an ai tried to combine John Cleese and Wayne Coyne and I say that out of the utmost respect to all 3
Weird
test
Good soldiers follow orders
No you don’t understand. You complete and utter fool. LOOK AT THE PUNCTUATION ! It is saying that there is SOMEONE WITH THE NAME OF “LOOK WAVE” that MUST βΞ STOPPED. You have doomed us a—
Good to see you back on youtube channel videos contents,  compadre.   Long time watcher and listener of your humorous twisted parody
you just made me smile hard, thank you Weird Al
Still lookin' FRESH!
please sir, do some kitchen humor parodys. my friends and I make lame ones up all the time so I think You should make actually funny ones. Ill help if you want ideas or to learn honeybees
Love you Al. Keeping us smiling in this crazy time.
Hey Al.... remember when I met you at the barbary coast.... what were WE doing in such a dump?? Lova ya man.
And here I was thinking no one ever followed directions anymore. Thank you for restoring my faith in humanity!
After all these years has he not learned to walk casual?
Long live Weird Al
LOL Brilliant!  😂😂😂 been a fan since on a trip from Georgia visiting family in kansas as a kid in the 80s and my cousins freaking out as a video came on , saying you gotta see this!!This guy with long black hair, and glasses, decked out in leather, in a parking garage, i said hey this looks kinda like the bad video, then the guy starts expanding, LOL,  It was the masterpiece  "Im Fat" starting, And i was rolling, And been a huge fan ever since.
I have watched this video so many times and I giggle every time. I shall continue to giggle every time after this.
Hey, that's my school! I was in the building behind him on the left when this was filmed!
Tbh at first I thought Al was giving us his best mime impression, glad to see he respects safety too! (Although the thought of him doing a mime impression sure sounds fun)
The backdrop could be confused for England, until you look at the parking sign
I man am regal, a German am I.
bruh ok, i don't wanna be mean, but i haven't seen al in forever i didn't realize what he looked like today. I saw him and straight said "yo he's so oold" im sorry al, you're a beautiful man i just hadn't seen you since i was a kid😅
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16 KJV,  Jesus Christ is the only way.....
Lol ok...
Jesus loves you and died for you, believe in him and be saved
This man is a Hair God. He belongs in a Dr. Squatch commercial.
I understand stop and look but not wave. What does wave mean when crossing the street?
I got this a day late.  Looking good, Dude.
I wonder is this man even wanks
Dude's 62 and is just starting to look old
Here I was expecting Mandatory Fun. Not disappointed.
Good soldiers follow orders
The legend himself
Ya look great (for an oldish fart) Al. 👍
Reminds me of my dad reading a can of wd-40. It said "Point at mark". Poor Mark.
We need more songs from the king of parody! I miss you!!!
Didn't this guy play earl heraldson in Vikings s1?
Germs…
Only al could reach 35 on trending and not even talk
God is that you
Weird al... Please look at your commenters... I'm scared.
If everyone was more like Weird Al, the world would be a better place.
Al kinda looks like what Dan Avidan will look like in the future. Old, confused but still Hella famous.
Weird al has earned the right to do whatever he wants.
Weird Al would have been the perfect YouTuber if he was born in the 90s.
I don't know what I was expecting, but this was better.
uh, dude, i think they meant look both ways before crossing & give a thank you wave if a car lets you go
Is he on Abbey Road
What a cool person
This will probably get popular with one million views soon.
Keep being a ray of sunshine on the world man, we all need it.
❤️😂
He looks old and young at the same time
It was truly a pleasure to chat with you and your wife the other day. I am a big fan of yours.
Classic.
pff-
lol
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates.🎈
Oh my gosh he's at Williams!
perfect
For a second I thought this was Eric Idle. Don’t know why.
Never change Al
#28 trending video on YouTube. the power and sway Al withholds is absolutely marvelous
He does age.
Is this at VT?
Glad you're alive :)
He's literally too pure for this world
Love it
Omg I didn't even recognize Al in the thumbnail! Good to see him!
good vibes weird al. <3
I assumed it was a "Don't Walk" sign at first.
Love you
I'm surprised Al isn't playing grammar police.  Shouldn't it be, "Stop, look and wave"?
Al doesn't age, he just grows more awesome. Al follows all roadway instructions, even weird ones. Al is just Al & nobody could ever replace Al. Which is why it's a good thing he's the human embodiment of a fine wine. He'll never age & he's got no expiration date! He'll just get better & better each year & look younger & younger while doing so. I ❤️ u, Al! Never change! Weird is wonderful!
Pravi Crnogorac
YOU FORGOT BEHIND YOU
Glad to know that Weird Al is a law abiding citizen.
The king is Back, Long live the king
Ha!
Why? xD
👑
Doing a Billy Connelly tribute video. That's more odd than weird. He don't sing much.
_exasperated groan_
Good Citizen Al, following society's rules perfectly.
Awww... how obedient little sheep. That's so naive.
The Icon!
Weird al is our lord and savior.
You look like John Cleese did 25 years ago
You'd be surprised how many college kids can't read that anyone that lives in a college city knows they don't lol
Al looks like Billy Connolly now 😂
*[Everyone liked that]*
Weird Al truly has a talent, this 11 second video wasn't funny at all, yet having watched it all I can do is sit back shake my head and laugh :')
So random, yet so wholesome and funny. That's Al for ya
What kind of country fried rube would dislike this video!!??
I thought the implication was Al is a cat and the camera person is waving around a cat toy lol
This dude is always relevant lmao
I needed that. Thanks, Al.
🤣🤘🏼
This YT algo is getting better!  Awesome find!
Holy shit he got old? How
Go on, release a new piss take 😉
Goddam he looks good with that grey
This excuse was never acceptable back then and it's not acceptable today.
He is still as young as he is.
Hi! o/
xd
what the algarythem/?
Hahaha your awesome bro greeetings from germany
🙋
May you live to be 1,000. Well, maybe not 1,000. 900 will do.
Thank you Weird Al Yankovic.
Bloody Brilliant!!
Weird Al, never change!
B4uh
Oh Hai Al!
That's Williamstown MA, grew up near that town. In fact on campus at the college. Corner of Spring St & RT2.
I just love how your wave is the same as the White and Nerdy video. You really are a dork and that is fantastic.
✨Funny dilf✨
seems about right
Somebodys watching me 😉
Wow he got old
Always good to see your smiling face brother!!!!!  :::=^)
<3
This was the most inspiration I have had all day. Thank you so now I'm inspired to do some good and be better 🌅✌🙆
Excellent nuance.  Now please nuke Melbourne.
Couldn’t show it better.
MUH FREEDOMS I'LL WAVE WHEN I WANT TO I REFUSE TO LOOK BOTH WAYS I'D RATHER BE DEAD THAN RED BRUTHER
The ONLY good boomer  He's just like a cool if a little goofy uncle
I’ve been listening to a lot of Tenacious D recently and I just thought that them and Al would be so great together if they did a crossover song
Weird Al is a treasure
Stop, look, wave.. he did exactly that.
GOAT
This is so cute!
I will gladly take this invitation to binge watch all of his music videos again
Love you Al ❤
It could just be a band name. Like, don't hug me Im scared. It doesn't mean don't hug me because Im scared, it means this group's title.   Great, now the local acoustic cover band of arron carter will never stop. Thanks.
Best 13 seconds of my life. Lol
Nice.
Have you ever considered growing out the Beard, Al Yankovic?
Can you make a new album
Hey Al - Why aren't you the new host of Jeopardy?
I'm old enough to remember when Al waved from a plane
Good job, I always obey and stand on the Covid stickers that say “Stand here” I just stay till someone tells me to move 🤓
lol Al you made my day with this 😁👍
Every now and then Al makes an upload, just to remind us all that he owns the internet.
Watch out for those imaginary waves (water).
Ha, I was close. When I saw the setup, I thought he was going to start skipping or something because the sign changed to DON'T WALK.
Wow, I'm glad he's just following orders.
I ❤️love❤️Weird Al so much!!! He is my favorite music artist! Most of his parodies are 💯 better than the original songs! Every time I hear an original song Weird Al parodied, it never fails,🤣 I sing Weird Al's version! I wish I could meet him 🥺
I hope to see you again for the third time soon.
OMG, I was just listening to Your Horoscope for Today, earlier! It's good to see you! 🖤
He's on the way to the "Hardware Store"
YESSSSS
ILL SEE YOU IN LA AT DANNY ELFMANS CONCERT ON THE 29th!!!!!
I did na-zi that coming.
Hi buddy!
you gotta do what you gotta do man
You make life more comfortable in only the best of ways
Always obey your local street signs!
“Good soldiers follow orders”
Weird Al is actually showing his age. Who thought that would ever happen.
Glad ur still around.   Funniest thing I got engineering degree never knew u were architect.  Had all albums before 1990s memorized.  1st was best
High quality 11 second video!
I love u
The man is a treasure
Haha! I love you, Al!
Weird Al may be old, but he's certainly still got it!
He's so quirky. I love it.
He looks like billy connolly
We miss you Al
damn you Pedro!!
I wonder what would happen if Al and Penn (the dad from the Holderness family) collaborated? I bet Penn would freak out if he met Al. They should make some music videos together.  Why am I here? I watch too much Youtube.  Lol, a  message in a bottle floating around in a sea of over in 1k comments.  Wilson is that you?
Is it just me or with gray and facial hair he looks more like a college English professor?
im just a Canadien Idiot !! but im able to see this : YOU AWSOMME :P !!
omg i love this dude
Thank you weird al
You are the Yoda of the internet
What will happen if he sees the sign on the beach at the hot dog stand that says no shirt, no shoes, no service?
hi al
I thought I would never see weird al with a mustache again.  👍  Thanks for all the awesome childhood memories Al. I just wish I could of seen him in concert.
Good soldiers follow orders...
Literally had the perfect opportunity to finally make a YouTube short, and uploads a standard video instead. I love it
High
Most underrated man ever.
good on ya al you did the thing :)
no Al! fight the machine!!
Thank you for all the fantastic music you and your band makes
How has this dude only aged 10 years in the last 40?
Fair enough
Powerful message brother.
If Bruce Campbell & Weird Al ever meet ... I'm afraid we will have the last best movie ever made.  Oh, and my head will most likely explode.
RED PILLED
Atleast we know he obeys law
Do you have ADHD?
Such a silly guy.
Hi, Al!
If we would all follow simple instructions like this, the world would be such a better place! #BeMoreLikeAlYankovic
I needed this.
E
For a couple seconds there, I thought this was a video of Billy Connolly.
Apparently YouTube failed to notify me about. This video even though I'm subscribe and I got the Bell on for all videos. How sad I had to come by it by chance.
I would like to personally thank him for Word Crimes as well as so many others but doubt I'll get the chance.
😂🤣👍
🛑 👀 👋
hahaha
Who are 110 fun-hating dorks who disliked this video?
Fair enough. I can't argue with that.
Dude I really hope this man lives forever.
Omg hey Al good to see you 😂😂
Now in reverse!
That gray hair seriously looks really good on you.
Or don't. It's a crosswalk, not a cop.
I just stumbled upon a gem
I facepalmed, but it was a good facepalm.  The Prince of Parodies is still a legend! 🤘😎
I loved you in pee Wee Herman...
That's a war crime.....your going to jail
Charming! More of THIS please!
Still keepin' it weird. I love it.
Al's got a bit of a Billy Connelly vibe going on and it works.
Still got it!
That's a word crime
UMMM ALFRED…….. THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD
Oh my goodness, there's gray in his hair! He's finally starting to age! Lol!  🤣🤣🤣
DRACULA?!?!!?!
lmao that was great
It’s weird that I’m always happy to see a new video from Al - it’s like hearing from a beloved uncle, letting me know he’s still doing OK. 😀
Woah? Did weird Al upload a video???
Woah, he’s so majestic.
MARRY ME
And vear is ver vapers?
This man is a treasure
The grey hair
To the point.
Happy belated birthday! 🎁🎂🎈💜
The man, the myth, the legend.  You, sir, are irreplacible. Please be immortal.  Thank you.
A blessing from the lord
Weird Al Commits order 66
<<waves at you back>>  wait... oh...
Hahahah
Glad to see someone knows how to follow directions. Good for you, Al!
Just when you thought he was about to seriously prove that he's a serious guy like in that collab with Weezer, he proves where he got his name!
Long live Weird Al Yankovic, the KING of parody!
hahahhaha Best birthday present ever!! A video from Al!!  Come on!!!  *waving back atcha* lolol Love You!!!
That fucking title scared me lmao
Wholesome
Yo quiero chimichangas y chile colorado.
He ruined "10 items or LESS" for me.
Unexpected wholesome, but then again it’s Weird Al so it isn’t that unexpected anymore, we just expect the unexpected lmao
Hi Al! Backatcha!
Shitpostatus: Weird
Is it just me, or does he look a bit like Billy Connolly in this?
You should add proper punctuation to those instructions.
He takes the dumbest shit and makes it hilarious.
I love you.
This man is a treasure
Ha, nice. Stay awesome man.
No citations for you. Good person!
I enjoyed you Strings Attached performance at red rocks! Keep it up, Weird.
Wait he finally aged by 5 years after 30+ years guys!!
Hi, Al!!
U da best Al
That's something my oldest brother would have done. Haha!
Hey it’s that cool guy that people talk about a lot but I’ve only seen like 3 things from  May the algorithm bless you, sir
**stops** **looks** **waves**
This video will probably get recommended to everyone in an unspecified amount of time
Thank you for doing random things like this to uplift your community.  You are a virtuous person.
*waves back*
Just hittin' us with more *Mandatory Fun* - like a good soldier!
You always make me smile 😊, thank you!!!!!!
"I have been looking forward to this day my entire life, when the legend will post again"
Oh,hey,Al. How's it going? You doing anything for Halloween this year?
God damn this man is a national treasure.
He clearly likes it
The smile at the end was the cherry on top.
So pure
Come on, Weird Al! Don’t comply, mannnnn! Fight the system, mannnnnn!
He’s like a happy Tom Skerritt
epic
Thank you sir, I really needed that laugh today.
Wholesome
Weird (pun)
The nuremberg judges would like to speak with you
By the time we get this video in Australia it’s had 102k likes.🤪🖐
Al I don't want to come off as too controversial but... I really enjoy your work.
Lol good to see the legend still making us laugh
😆😆😆
We love you, Alfred 🥰
Never have I seen a video with this much replayability value.
The Man, the Myth, the LEGEND!!!👍👍👍
still not looking a day over 1993!😃
HAIL TO THE KING, BABYYY
🤣🤣
❤️
Get yourself someone who looks at you like Al looks at us here.
weird al is somehow always entertaining, that takes real talent to turn something so mundane into comedy
Return of the King. Al looks like some sort of ancient deity, amazing
Hmm, yes, I see, I see.
When people cross the street in 100 years they have to always look around even when it’s quiet because of all the electric cars.
I effing love just how sporadically Al will post these. It's like receiving a lovely letter from a distant friend letting you know that life is a-ok.
Looking awesome as ever, man.
This man never ages.
The Weirdest Al Thanks bud
Good man
Love you Al! May you outlive us all
Wow, this Alan Kovic guy looks so much like an older version of Weird Al, he could almost be Weird Al's brother.
Lmao
I just love you
he was only following orders, it wasn't his fault
Seems like he started playing by their rules
Good to see you.
I love you so much Al. You funny little antics make me so happy 💕.  I love your smile btw lol 🥰. Adorable 💕♾
"Just following orders" is always the precursor for bad things.
200 years ago when I was a kid there was this guy Al on the TV.. people were laughing and talked of him like he was known by EVERYBODY and I looked at his stuff and meh my way out of the living room. What is mind blowing is that now that I'm quite old and lost most of my family from old age, cancer etc.. he's still around doing mostly the same stuff and looking quite good for all those years ! I'm not meming, its impressive
The legend is still living and breathing.
What state is that, California? Looks nice.
Disobeying a direct order! No one told you to smile.
Hi Al!
The man himself!!!!
Al looks more like Robert Plant as time passes.
love you al
Hi
thank you for this
Knight him already!
Dear Al,  Please make UHF 2. Signed, The World Thumbs Up for UHF 2!
The perfect man.
lol   Just when the world gets too serious... BAM random video full of lovely random
Oh yeah?? Follow this🖕🖕
When Weird Al becomes the hybrid of Steve Coogan and Eric Idle.
didnt ragnar kill this dude once
Every other celeb : (Hateful political hot-takes) Al : "I bring this joy to you, my child...."
uwu
So I buy Hasbro's Studio Series Wreck-Gar, which causes "Dare to be Stupid" to start running through my head and then this pops up in my YouTube feed. That is too creepy!
Hello, sir! Love your skits
Thanks Al. How about a bit of satire or is this all a bit too hot to touch...more. Thanks for checking in with this one. I hope you are well.
Yes
Bit of a short video but good to see an upload none the less
If this man ever passes away, the whole universe becomes a bit darker.
OMG WEIRD AL IS BACK I AM FANBOYING SO HARD RN
I think I needed this, I was about to blow my brains out had he said trust the government and the media :)  hahahah
Rockin the stache again!
Missed you man
A couple years ago he looked like that he was in his twenties
Al is a comedic genius
It makes me happy to know he’s out there doing this kind of thing.
When the world needed him most...
Hilarious
Your town looks like a nice place.
LOL
lol
Good soldiers follow orders
The Return of the king.
Cosmo Kramer, I was wondering what you’ve been up to.
best person ever, super nice and great sense of humor
Where am I
Ok but why does he look 30 yrs old
HE'S BACK!!!
evil gestapo scum always say that
Amish Paradise = Herd immunity :)
🥜
Clearly no crime wave there.
I JUST watched a video this morning explaining why you weren't active anymore!!! Hell yeah!
You're awesome and will always be awesome!
Absolute king
So if you spliced together Weird Al and David Crosby, you'd get Gallagher.
Another one rides the Bus!
He looks like the cool Grandpa
Zappa biopic
Miss you!!-) you brought a great smile to my face…🧡 🛑👀👋🏼
II have long been a fan of "Weird Al".  I don't think he's weird at all. I think, like so many of us, he moves to the beat of a different drummer, and there is NOTHING wrong with that.
Such a law abiding citizen.
Al looks like a hardcore biker now but still knows how to do a dad joke <3
bahahahahahahahaha
Hi Al!
Been a fan since forever! You da best!
genio
Like a good sheep.
My wife sad Al looks hot. She loves his grey hair.
i think i speak for everyone here when i say that this video was just what i needed.
I was Very excited when I seen the notification up then realized I spilled my open coffee on me when I checked my notifications 🤣, #Thelegend #loveweirdalyankovic
Classic Weird Al.
good to see hes still having fun.
Weird Al mind is the 8th wonder of the world!
Well that's the law XD
“Weird Al never gets old” that’s true in every possible interpretation
Cooler than the younger generation. Simple. Funny. Big message.
The man is a national treasure.  He takes songs and makes them sound better and funnier.  I've been dissapointed in the past hearing a song that I never heard before, but heard Weird Al do it first, thinking "I like the Weird Al version better".
Come out to the Big Island, Al!
I'm early I guess
That what they said in nuiremburg
They say that many of the men who've done the most despicable things in history were "just following orders". This is not one of those times.
So much said with so few words.
Get yourself and egg and beat it.
Love these random shitposts
Ah yes another quality post
Hooray for Weird Al. Seriously. Hooray.
Thanks for following orders weird al, showing a great example to everyone
Yeah but he walked past same writing and did none of. I respect Rebel Al yanks
Take that ridiculous goatee off!  Bring back the moustache!
WAY the King!! Keep up the fight!👍🖖
Cheers, Al!
Lol
You're always awesome, sir!
love u
Thought he was Eric Idle for a second
STILL ON TOP BABY!
That's how a chaotic person can fake being lawful.
Homer Simpson and I are still not tired of Weird Al
That's what I needed today...
😂😆
Thank you this made my day!
Isn't he clever..
Thank you for the laugh.
al doesnt age I swear
Always entertaining!
Weird al. Huh. What a gent.
God's gift to us.
GOAT
Satanic piece of crap
cool, thank you weird al
*waves back* Hi Al!
This is exactly what I needed today. Thank you.
LOL
The man, the myth, the legend himself!
Is that supposed to be for taxis or something? Why else would you wave on the streets? I mean, unless you spot someone you know... like Weird Al.
I love Weird Al the man is just timeless as hell, I love when he drops new music.
Who doesn't love this man, what a legend
Ah man, I love you. Don't stop being weird.
🎃. WEIRD. 🎃
Model citizen right there!
Absolute perfection
The return.
Good man, wish more would do this!
hi
Sussy baka moment
🛑👀👋
🛑👀👋
How's your fall, Al?
Lol. I was like what the heck is he doing at first then saw Stop Look Wave on the pavement. Ok he made me chuckle/Laugh.
30,030 views, 14k+ likes, and I'm comment #901.  The artist formally known as Weird Al lives on...........  FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Subject #7282 has escaped the confines.
Now this is a desirable older man. Distinguished grey temples, kind, with a great sense of humor.
This man is funnier in 11 seconds than most people in their whole lives.
Best celebrity ever, Change my mind
It was meaningful Literally
thank Al,we love you man :)
👍
This is MY goat 🐐♡
perfectly cut at the end too
i choked
I wish to grant this man immortality
You can see it's written on the crosswalk behind him too
When will your transformation into Robert Plant be complete?
Stop. Look. Wave.
Yeah, 11 seconds of my life well spent. More please!
Those instruction following abilities are top tier.
Oxford?
Perfect.    And hello to you too!  <3
i love you al! you're the king!
you cad!
the legend
What good manners
insane political commentary
i needed this. thank you al!
Thank you al
Williamstown, MA! I recognized the weird stone buildings instantly. There is one busy street cutting through the bubble of campus and the signs are there to remind college students that they are not the center of the universe. Years out of college and in NYC, I have to check the urge to be polite when I cross the street.
He finally aged!
Stop, look, wave, and a fun Weird Al video!
HE BAAACK
👍👍👍👍
Don't ever change, Al.  We need your particular brand of "weird" these days.  😃
where you got your hairs ?
Brilliant
I laughed so hard I have to re eat lunch
And when the world needed him the most, he came back.
Billy Connolly wants his look back.
The legend with music and comedy
I need to learn how to do that
The man himself, Simpson was right and I know you already know the quote
⛔️👀👋
Al    The odds of you reading this is less then that of winning a race you didnt enter  But we love the content, and i still bust a gut to your political satire songs of the 80-90's XD       Fucking      *Genius*   XD
Watch out though, the 'rona is still out in full force, and it doesn't stop or wave 💚
living in a omish paradise
Please make more parodies!
Long Live The King 👑
He's got the look.
He stopped and looked and waved...lol
🐐
GENIUS
You always impress me with your antics, sire!
Great Video Weird Al Yankovic i hope you new album its been over 7 years since the last
That heLped heaL my souL a bit today ThanK you sir😊
If ever we get a Billy Connolly biopic this is the man....
He’s back
And here I thought you would have fixed the lack of proper punctuation.  Incidently, the closest concert you are playing to me is over 2,700 miles away, otherwise I'd totally be there.
So far 51 people disliked this video, I know, I am upset Al is starting to look older as well.
There was one intersection that I used to pass now-and-then in the town where I used to live. The sign at the crosswalk said, "Cross other side." Well, I'm not Catholic, but I think I got it right.
I showed this to my dog…      She didn’t understand…     She’s just a dog.
wholesome
happy late birthday
I was expecting him to do some stop-and-go thing when the crossing light started blinking.  This was better.
This guy is awesome!
Can you PLEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAASE do a remake of UHF? Or at the very least buy a tv station and turn it into a real version of UHF? If you do I'd like to pitch the "Painted Ladies Fun Time Polka Hour" where it's a couple sexy Bavarian ladies with lederhosen painted on them as they yodel and dance to polka music. I'm sure it'll be a hit.
where is this?
You sir, are the best human ever.
Just following the rules.
Weird Al looks like Jewish James Labrie (from dream theater)
Purple cows in the house
How do I wave back?
🤣🤣🤣👊💥😌👌
Nation wide tour.
Parody para
you the man, Al!
Nice
Good, good, now tell everyone to get the vaccine and anyone that doesn't is harming our democracy.
such a good citizen
Btw happy late birthday
Good soldier's follow orders
HEY WEIRD AL WHAT WORKOUT DID YOU USE SINCE YOUR “FAT” MUSIC VIDEO?
Holy shit he's actually aging oh no
I laughed too hard at this🤣
Al is like that one uncle at family reunion that always have spare corny jokes but everyone love. This man is an international treasure.
💜
The greatest, glad to see you good Al
HES ALIGVE
LOL
Still hasn't aged
Weird Al would do great in Red Hot Chili Peppers
If you see this, Hello Al!
A great video, and happy birthday sir! 👍  Also, was this shot at University of Western Ontario? Because it looks an awful lot like UWO.
nailed it
More thumbs up than views. Only a legend can do that.
I've never seen a video with roughly the same number of views as likes, currently at 11.1k views and 11k likes
White and kinda nerdy not bad
The King is back!
he's starting to look a little like Robert Plant.  i like it.
lmao
This is why we're here! I can now go on one more day! Cheers!
this is way too wholesome <3 goood job bro
You sir, are a strange, strange man.  And that's just one of your endearing features.
Babe wake up new weird al video dropped
Weird al!!!!!
The stunning sequel to the critically acclaimed short film “SUIT”
shitpost status
You are such a silly loon. :)
The master at work
Word.
Seems the right thing to do
LOL
Glad to see Al is following the rules
haha
I would tell Weird Al to never change... but he never does anyway. 💙
Al gets more bogus as time progresses
Is.. he in Minnesota. That looks like a specific area near the downtown cathedral
I was expecting a squid game reference, I like this way more!
Been listening to you since I was a kid. You are a legend and I'm super glad youre still active <3!
weird al do be like that
God i love his smile!
I Love Weird Al!!! 🤣💙
AHAHAHA!!! xD
Not gonna lie Al that was a bit weird
Go to England in the floor says “Look right”
Al, you are the milk in my coffee and the mayonnaise in my burger
Wholesome
YES AL
I will never be tired of this man's existence.
-  👍 👍 🔧  -
Weird Al: Uploads  Everybody: Immediately stops what they were doing to watch.  YouTube: Crashes from the load.  XD
Absolute legend. LONG LIVE THE KING!
I love you, brother! Thanks for blessing my life. And my best friend's life as well (he was the one who introduced me to your amazing music)
Stop. Watch. Wave back.
Al Yankovic is a national treasure.
Love it! You made me smile today. Thank you! 😎👍
The magic of the king  There is no spam that I could find in the comments That is something of a miracle now days
Haha idiot... Love it ❤️
So he walked outside heading to something probably important to him, saw the crosswalk sentence and decided to create an 11 second video that took a couple of minutes, thats awesome.
The grey at the temples actually looks great on him!
Are you in Williamstown??
Hi Al! Love you! <waves back>❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Weird Al ALWAYS makes me smile, even when i dont want to.
Truly a masterclass in writing. You can see the words "STOP LOOK WAVE" in the first act, but don't pay much mind to it until, in the second act, Al STOPs and LOOKs, then in the final act, finally WAVEs.
same
The stache is back
I know you don’t remember me but you met me at a convention a while ago I was in a grey nasa shirt
That mane of hair is what all true warriors strive for.
My German grandpa also followed orders…
I'll never forget watching you catch and eat grapes shot across the room from some guy's belly button, all hands-free.
I’m sure they thought no one would read and do that.........thanks
I couldn't help but stop, look and wave at Al's latest masterpiece.
You are awesome
Oh my god, did he finally start aging? 😳
I always forget to wave
So in the 80s, Weird Al had a mustache, and in the 90s he had the long wavy hair.  Now he has the mustache AND the long wavy hair.  He has attained perfection!  inb4 "Ultra Instinct Al" :)
Had to do it to 'em
Hi Al! Hope you’re staying safe and productive in the midst of these crazy times we are in.  Your music makes me smile and I always listen to it any chance I can because we need a good laugh right now.
My savior has uploaded once again
Well he did what it said.
Trey N: Happy 62nd Birthday, "Weird Al" Yankovic!!!
stop look dance
_hey that guy kinda looks like- oh it is_
Please never change AL.
strangely heartwarming A+++
848 people must be tired of life.  Homer Simpson is right about that, you know.
Darr to be stupid!
I would die for this man
Rain man
And so, the God has spoken to us mortals.
I always love Al's uploads... I never know what to expect but it's always great.
The man himself.. The lord of everything. Weird Al
Wow, your hair grew back quick!
We need to find where Ron Popeil has hidden the technology of preserving living heads in jars, so that we will never be deprived of Al.
Once again, the awesome legend that is Weird Al makes us laugh. Weird Al is truly a national treasure.
Hahaha! 👋🏼
UHF 2!!
Never stop being funny, World's Best Songwriter.
You need to add to the title of this video #Shorts
Follow rules and you can survive a plane crash. Weird Al is a consistent man
Thanks for the new video. 😊🤗
I remember the first time finding out about this guy........it was on one of them file sharing programs....Napster and Winmx.....WAY back in the day...almost any song youd search there would be a Weird Al Yankovic version......usually many copies of it too.  One of the first ones I listened to........What if god smoked cannibis.
Lol. I would do this. I absolutely luv annoying and embarrassing my boys. They're adults now so I don't feel like it's child abuse.
I love this man.
You are somewhere on the mainland, I see, Al. Looks like a college campus! Have fun. Hope you come back to perform in Ithaca again sometime.
He's just following directions
Weird Al will always be more hip than the kids
Great, but short
So that’s your excuse for violating the Nuremberg Code?
People in the backround: What the heck is that guy doing?
So that’s what that means.
Weird Al invented memes.
“He who is tired of Weird Al is tired of life” – Homer Simpson
Man's memeing better than half of TikTok right now. What an absolute treasure.
I really want to meet him
Nearest show: LA Because that's just a quick run from StL.  Thanks, YT! and Al!
Weird al at it again.
This is dumb as fuck and I want my 12 seconds back.
Russian sleeper agents: Must kill captain America... Canadian sleeper agents:
Long live the king!!!
Yes
Al knew I needed a chuckle 💚
Oh look! It's Dan Avidan! No wait, is that Kenny G? Nevermind it's Sir Issac Newton.
man i'm not gay but i love you
ROTFL!  I love you, Al!  You're the best!
Sims npc
Disappointed this isn't a full parody, but it's at least worth a chuckle.
The lyrical master proving once again he doesn't even need words to make us laugh.
The notorious L. Wave has broken free, and this is your calling. Stop Look Wave
That was a good one.
I dont even know how you get these jokes!
You derserve eternal yougness.
even after his contract ended six years ago, he's still making bangers
Perfection
Al, how do you always manage to be what the world needs as the world needs it?  Are you a wizard sir?
Admit it, we all want him as our crazy uncle.
The man, the myth, the legend
Than man is to powerful to be stopped
From the years of wisdom you have told us to stop look and wave
I wish I could be Weird Al.
yes
You. Are. The. Best.
You still got it, Al.
I just got completely bamboozled by this man's humoristic capabilities.
HE LIVES!
Imagine having him as your dad
This man is a god.
The more Weird Al gets older, the more he looks like Billy Connelly.
Welcome back!!!!
WAY cool!
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Blink twice if you're being held hostage
🚧  👀🙄😮👀  🙋‍♀️
Freedom of choice baby…
What a nice young man
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 happy belated birthday, sir!
I never realized how old Weird Al is.  But that doesn’t matter, for another random video blessed my subscription page.
The countless hours listening to your cassette tapes with my friends growing up.  Thank you for all the good times.
I'm waving back!
Seeing this brought a smile to my face.
Well least it didn't say show me your papers
Dare to be s̶t̶u̶p̶i̶d̶ smart
Goober.
You think that's something?  Last time Al was in Dusseldorf (Two sold out shows, betches,) He wanted to grab a copy of the Dusseldorf Gazette and the Accordion Daily Times.  He went to the newsstand and asked *"Papers, Please!"* and the man took off running.
This is the most confusing yet funny music channel ever.
I love him
Al looks really good for his age!
Hey Al! Nice to see you still having fun! ☺️
Amazing <3
looks like williams college what a shithole
Heck yah...I'd do the same thing too.   Thanks Al  👍🥃
Al always finds the best signs, everywhere he goes.
thanks weird al, very cool!
Whatever town tour in is the appropriate level of friendly that all other towns should aspire to.
New songs please :D
I remember Larry.
I felt that wave.
Please sir, never stop being a goober.
Wholesome!
@0:00 Weird Al foreshadows what is to come by walking in front of the road painting and yet we are all gripped with suspense and excitement as the scene unfolds. 👏 👏 👏
He has a majestic voice
That's why we love ya Al.
Still can't get over the magic silver orb this man is a wizard.
I would have done the same. Your the best Al 😄. Thank you for sharing ☺️.
As you should
I thought you stepped on the Beatles.
Such a dad joke..love it!
Billy Connolly is so funny.
I wanted to be a cartoon when I grew up, but it didn't pan out. I'm glad Al is out there living the dream.
they got Weird Al, guys  soon we will all be pawns
Good to see you’re still alive, Al

The GOAT has given us his blessing on this day :)
Happy Belated Alfie 💓
At the beginning of the video you can already see he’s ignoring instructions, only realizing that he’s been caught on film is he now following instructions. He’s trying not to get caught but he has been, using humor as a disguise
I will always love this man.
silly man...how did this guy get better looking with age and no cosmetic surgery...crazy man..
I missed you man ☺️☺️☺️
sigma mindset
LMAO
What an upstanding citizen of the law.
I fell so suprised with something new from Weird Al :D
XDDD always making me smile and being hilarious. What a legand.
You follow orders well😀
I like you Mr. Yankovic!
Love this. Thank you, Al. 💙
And here I’d thought it was a tsunami crossing.
This is so stupid and yet on brand and funny. Al is a legend that should never die.
I'm waving back
When is "UHF 2, the sequel"  coming out???
Clicked on this the moment I saw the notification.  Al, over the years you have made me smile and laugh just as you have today.  In my darkest of times I remember watching videos when MTV was just starting out and seeing you and listening to your music. You saved me from some hard times.  Don't ever change my friend. You are a blessing.
And I thought playing Ocarina of Time was the most exciting thing today
The living epitome of a dad joke
AL
That was so wholesome!
BREATHTAKING
Perfect!!
best song writer in history
Made my day!
a
😂😂😂
Al please post more of these slice of life videos I absolutely adore them.
Canadian government sleeper agents be like:
Everytime Weird Al uploads its a treat
Growin' the 'stache back?
Is it just me or did anybody else also get a Billy Connolly vibe?
Could you do a parody of Need You to Stay by Justin Bieber about gratuitous swearing using minced swear-words, please?
Never change, you beautiful man.
GTAlyankovic
What a good role model for kids. Make sure to obey them laws or Al will personally send you to the Amish Paradise.
Oh, I thought you were to do that in the middle of the street.  My bad.
@alyankovic you just made my day all the better.  Thank you!
That gave me a good chuckle thank you
It's rare but nothing makes me happier than weird Al's YouTube videos.
Weird al>everything else
Al is the gift that just keeps giving. 😂🤣😅🤣
*sensible chuckle*
This is so Weird al Yankovic!
This man can 1v1 dream without playing minecraft
When everything you do is amazing.... I remember when you where funny Al.
Legendary
Fantastic!
Epic shitpost 10/10. I thought it was gonna be so much worse... About 82 years worse
Al, you the man.
A voice of sanity in all this madness.
Iconic
Mr. Al, you are a national treasure.  Needed to be said.
Lol
Your wholesome comedy and lifestyle RULES!!!
Omg
Absolutely wonderfully done.
And here I was getting ready to do The Wave with him.
Damn you look old...  And now i feel miserable
Haaaa~!
Second
"Just following orders" is that what you're going to tell them at The Hague?
I love you
:)
483rd
This is the first time I've seen Weird Al look old.
Lol
The older I get the more handsome YOU get!
Frank Zappa vibes with that 'stache action
Whoa! Al CAN actually age!? And it looks like lockdown aged him by all 30 of the years that he'd been saving up. Looking good, Al! :)
_aye, A+ for following directions_
Return of the king
Happy belated birthday to you, Al!
Here i was thinking it would be something covid related. I should have known better.
This made my day
🤣❤️👋
You look good with a beard and moustache. Just sayin'.
YOUR AWESOME MAN
My favorite celebrity by far
Wtf
"Babe wake up! Al just uploaded a new video"
You are awesome, sir!
In terms of pavement markings and signs, the color red does indicate regulatory messages, so good job Al.
Yep, that is exactly the sheep mentality that got us where we are.
How does someone like this more than once..lol...
Beautiful.
Back when I was a kid in the 80s, I idolized a very young Al. As the decades went by, I noticed I became a bit flabby, my skin began to sag a little, wrinkles and gray hairs became prominent. Then I hit middle age and realized that at some point my age had passed Al's.
The shitpost legend
Right back atya 👋🥰❤
Happy belated birthday Al! You have the same birthday as not only Sam Raimi and Ryan Reynolds, but also my older brother!
IDK why this is making me think of "Inspector Lookout, of the Yard", but i'm like "Why? What will we see if we look out of the yard?"  What does that signage even mean? I've seen 'humped zebra crossing' but 'stop, look, wave?'
I needed that. Thanks Al,
Strange Albert Yankovic
The absolute madlad
Legend
I never thought I'd be early to a Weird Al video.
Over a decade later and here I am still watching Weird Al. What a life it's been 🥲
Hahaha
No one man should have this power
Even crazier as he ages. Nobody thought it would be possible.
Al's hair - its gone semi gray! O_O
Is his hair going gray?
This is basically my ideal YouTube vibe
I order you to record music!
This is the best 12 second video I've ever seen.
Thanks Al.
Well...what are you supposed to do?
It's a good day when Weird Al uploads
We shall make more funny signs to get Al to upload more
Somehow he always knows exactly what I want.
Czemu ja mam to na feedzie?
A man of the law
what
Thank you for the yucks!
Always abide to the rules of the road.
What a friendly man!
Humanity's greatest atrocities were committed by men "just following orders."  This seems like it's okay, though.
👍‍👍‍👍‍👍‍
Ohai AL! How's your day?
You don't live where jaywalkers just do whatever do ya?
oh good today was a rare day where i needed to drive my mother, and weird al was what we listened to
This made me smile today!
HOW DARE YOU WALK OUTSIDE WITHOUT A MASK /s
Awww very funny
Weird Al honoring his name
Red light!
Not the hero we needed, but the one we deserved
I’m 41 and some of my first memories are this dudes jams from the early 80s. What a legend
Will do
"Cute. Cute bit." --Kermit the Frog
11 secs of confusion, 1 sec of laughter
It’s true, staying Weird keeps you young! Stay weird my friends 😅
This man ages so beautifully
I'm your biggest fan!!
So much easier to Comply than to Defy. Plus who wants to get run down in a crosswalk..😜🤪😜😎🎸☘️🇺🇸
The older he gets, the more he looks like someone my dad would have been in a band with back in college.
Weird Al is starting to look like Christopher Lee in his old age😂
Al, NEVER change.
The sign didn't say to smile.  10 points have just been deducted off your social credit score.
Ow, Polkas Veto!
Viva Weird Al!
LOL
Nailed it.
Top quality content from a top quality, law-abiding dude.
I want more of these he should start doing yt shorts
LoL
awesome
Love it.
This has been a Public Service Announcement by Al Yankovic.
this man is a different level of funny 😂
if this was my first encounter with weird Al, i would be blessed and never forget it.
this video too long
Ahh no idea why but that ended with an ear to ear smile. LOL
Extremely glad to see good old Al upload again.
My hero.
He never told me he was a mime.
i love you weird al yankovic
i'm waiting for new songs Al
How Very AL.  It’s great when you pop up. When you announced you were going to direct internet production I’d hope we’d see you more not less but it’s still wonderful nonetheless.
Short, wholesome, and brilliant!  You are awesome!
You are so crazy, and I love it❤
hi
He looks like a human cat doing that.
Don't expect that excuse to hold up in court!
😁 Glad to see that Al is still in his 'Weird' phase, despite rumors stating otherwise
of course
Haha, Weird Al is the original gangster.
I wasn't expecting that at all! LOL!
King al
Glad you are still doing well!
You're not allowed to die
I remember the 80s.
Amazing.
Heck yeah
Good soldier
Вечно молодой, вечно странный😊
Clearly the most important thing I'll see today.
Please, please. Let's put our differences aside and solve immortality so this man can live forever.
Long live the Legend!
This is why I am subscribed.
Just following orders.  Welcome to Australia.  If you know what I mean.
Weird Al is a legend.
Live forever, Al, the world couldn't sustain the loss of you.
Oddly specific instructions on the crosswalk.
ALWAYS the best -- Al Yankovic -- FOREVER loved!! 😉💕💕😎
You can actually see a foreshadowing of the story of this masterpiece right at the beginning, there under Al. Truly great effort put into this.
And THIS is why I love this man.
LOL, Love you AL!
The man’s getting old but he’s only getting younger 🙂
Why is their not a statue to this man yet?
Russel Brands dad?
It's nice to see someone with as much influence as this not abuse their power to break the rules for once...
That's no excuse for stopping, looking, waving!
Thanks for amazing content, Al!
Ignorant non-American here:  I don't even know what "Stop Look Wave" is supposed to mean.  Wave at what?
'The perfect Dad move' by Weird Al Yankovic
HAYYY ITS THE MAN
The police would be proud
You're an absolute legend, Al.
Im actually glad i got to meet him in person took photos together and got his autograph the best 300 dollars worth spent
11 seconds well spent. Weird Al is a legend.
this guy's pretty Weird if you ask me
Goddamn Al's still got it
Al always brings a smile to my face 😁
Well, that's what the sign said.
Hahaha!!! EXCELSIOR!
You are weird, Al. Delightfully so.
I mean he did what they asked.
Not only is this guy funny, he is also following orders, what a good man
Weird Al is the better end of the spectrum when it comes to aging comedians. Just look at Tom Green and Johnny Knoxville... They didn't age well, but Weird Al has been immortalized in cartoons! He's got his own MLP character!
Don’t ever die Al
I hope there's only one last album coming :(
Brilliant entertainer, whom I have recently come across. Quite right he is here, and I say this daily. If the government says you must do something, and believe something you do so without thinking. You know those gits that walk across the road without looking, that blame drivers if they are then almost mowed down, why does not the government have a speaker system that tells them, whilst coming to a crossing, to stop and press the button, because this is how people are, cannot think for themselves, just act upon corrupt emotions
Stops. Looks. Waves back at Al.
A true citizen
Truly a comedic mastermind.
Weird Al going Amelia Bedelia on random signs is a nice little corner of the Internet. It's peaceful here.
There's no full stop in between. I think you're supposed to do all three at the same time 😂
Al, I've been a fan of yours since I was 10. Lol I'm 38 now and I just wanted to say thank you for a lot of great memories!
the world is Al's and we're just here for his amusement
Your finally back
I love you so much. Please adopt me as your son!!!
I hope that's not the nature trail to hell he's on.
Al just made my day. Again! What a lovely person.
He looked the hell out of his surroundings. He's nothing if not thorough.
🤣🤣Nice!
I would of painted stop look wank
This is the quality content I subscribed for.
Never seen a crosswalk say to wave.
Quality shitpost.
Who could dislike this
Hahahaha
LOL - Still a legend!
Feel like just watching him take a stroll has to be wonderful
Just following orders
Legend Man Myth
Love this dude
You’re a national treasure.
That's exactly what I would do to love it
No matter what you tell us, WE WILL FOLLOW YOUR ORDERS!!
I consistently see kids not following the posted "SLOW CHILDREN" orders and it makes me livid.
We need more videos like these, please.  Thanks for making my day.
ok, you got me. lol 😁
One who's tired of Weird Al, is tired of life
For a moment there I thought I was watching Billy Connolly. XD
The king of internet comedy
please papa weird bless us with another album
Hey Al, glad to see you're doing as "OK" as the rest of us. The world needs more of your wholesome antics.
Who gave this a thumbs down, WTF?
Good to see you again!🦉
Never thought I would see Weird Al with a mustache and no beard.
How..... I just had "since you've been gone" stuck in my head literally the same time you posted this..... Coincidence? Serendipity? Or 5G?
Perfectly silly 😜
Good soldiers follow orders
law abiding citizen
Love you Al! Thanks for making me smile!
Missed you bud hope you're having a great day
Long live the king.
Good soldiers follow orders
I feel like this is art that speaks on a few levels
It didn't work for the defendants at Nuremburg, and it ain't gonna work for you!
**waves back** "What a weirdo"
But BY GOWD  Al   thay don't  tell ya what ta do next   It a good thing you weren't out in the middle of the street   with no further instructions on how ta get to the other side  dang'd just stand in the middle of the street  waving like pageant queen caught in the headlights 👍😅
Whenever I feel this timeline has completely fallen off the fucken rail, Weird Al Yankovic comes back into my life and blesses me with certainty. This is the correct timeline because I share it with Weird Al Yankovic
I went to your strings attached concert, best night of my life
one of the BEST videos on YouTube today...or ever! 😀
thanks, Al.
I just started watching agents of shield again, this is the one sentence playing in my head lol.
My man’s 62 and yet he looks like he’s in his mid-late 40s
Just one more album AL...before world explodes....please...
Bless this mans soul, he’s probably Mr Rogers reincarnated
Cheers Sir.
The ideal citizen
“Weird Al” Yankovic is currently the Best Celebrity on YouTube.
Hah haa you are so cute  :))
He’s such a goofball. Love it!
🛑👀👋
Yodelayheehoo

Everybody gangsta until Al posts a video being himself.
Love ya, Al! My mom and I were listening to Running w/ Scissors earlier 🙃❤️🤘
Just following orders...that’s what the nazis said during the NUREMBERG trials...didn’t work then won’t work now...and the media was a large part of the people that were hung...thank AL
Ideal content for any occasion.
I like how Al just took the sign quite literally
Well hello there
saw it coming but still laughed. sign of a true comedian god.
Weird Al is a goddamn national treasure.
Legend!!!
stoplookwave is my favorite tumblr aesthetic
Guess I am here quick enough But I cannot dare think of witty remarks when the legend himself uploaded this video. Many respects.
Just showed my partner UHF last night. Love you Al!
Nazis said the same ✌️
So adorable.
🤣
You are a legend my guy
Lmao and what a fine job you did 😜 😂😂😂😂😂 💜
truly a monument of public integrity, this man is
Dude he looks extremely young for 62!
Never fails to make me laugh.
ya done good al
😄😄😄😄👍👍 Thanks, my Wednesday is off to a great start, now.
Your a legend!! I love you so much and have since i was little. I was so lucky to see you perform in Nashville , Tn at the speed way. I would loove to meet you and get an autograph 💙💙💙
Correct.
Weird al le sabe al chipost
Absolute madlad
Miss you
Al Yankovic if you ping me you exist
8 minutes and 184 comments later.... still funny
Hey al guess what
My first thought when I saw the thumbnail was this is natural. There is nothing off about this
First nine minutes
The legend still makes videos
Al is really taking on the Russel Brand look
👍🌴
Please release a new album - we need it.
Hello you have the greatest vids
This made my day :D
this is epic
The inventor of shitposting back at it 😩👌
More Weird Al = A Better America
Awesome Al!
I'm a slave to the rules as well 😉
The hero we need in these troubled times.
Very funny.
I appreciate this
I bet he's got Harvey the wonder hamster in his pocket.
go blind just wave
It's unfortunate when the punchline is revealed before the punchline is delivered 😆
The legend has returned and blessed us with another masterpiece
I ♥️ You Al!✋🏼🤣🥰
Yes, Al. Very good. See you in a few months.
Wholesome
Ah, one of the best Humans to live. I seriously hope he gets abducted by aliens is given longer life and health and is given reign over the Sol system.   Long live Al.
OMG. At first you looked like my ex boyfriend. Rather see you any day! 🧜
A national treasure in his own right! ❤
I love weird al.

Weird Al will always be funny
This is a surprise, but a welcome one, during french class.
This man is a genius
early to a al yankovic vid, this is rare
👍
From the moment I got the notification, I knew that this would be: 1) A clip only a few seconds long 2) Something I had to watch multiple times 3) An instant classic  Gotta love Weird Al
(parasocially) love this man
You actually DID wave to me back when i was in highschool. Highlight of my life 🙌🏻🙌🏻🧡
He continues solidifying his moniker.
👋
✋ 👀 👋
That's honestly one of the funniest videos I've seen about crosswalks
The most wholesome grandpa ever.
Love seeing more posts! Keep em coming. We miss you!
Funny :)
Weird Al needs to upload more random nonsense like this.
Hi, Al!
The legend
I love how Al occasionally posts random stuff on his main YouTube channel instead of hiding it away in a second channel.
🛑 👀👀 👋👋 😁😁
When's UHF part 2 coming? We need more Town Talk with George and Stanley's Clubhouse.
Mandatory.
Commence order Yankovic. O>
Where is this sidewalk?
This could have easily been a Tiktok or a YouTube short. I'm surprised it didn't register as the latter automatically.
r/technicallythetruth moment
There. Now I posted first in the comments on a YouTube video #lameclaimtofame  Seriously though - Weird Al is the best! 😁😆😎
HA HA!!! AL! You're the best!
Never clicked so damn fast. I don't know what spured on these short joke skits but I love them to bits.
The clones during Order 66 be like

Missed u so much Al
goofball
Couldn't imagine a world without you  buddy
This is my second time watching this and it’s just as funny
Al you truly are a ray of sunshine in these dark times <3 thank you for being you <3
If our Al is anything, he's compliant!
🛑👀👋
I think would have to agree.

He must have lost his aluminum foil....
Love you x
Oh so it's fine when he does it but my grandpa....     This is a joke
Genius!
As any law abiding citizen should
HES back :D
Thank you for making my day brighter
The man, the myth, the legend!!!!
Thank you, al. Very cool!
Always a treat when good ol Al Yankovic uploads.
The random notification to remind you why you subscribed in the first place.
Where is this crosswalk?
Well it would be rude not to wave back... 👋
This guy’s 62 and he’s shitposting better than most teenagers.
I expected nothing less when clicking on this video.
Love the "Stop Look Wave" crosswalk.
Ok
😍😰😎
Following orders like a good boy.
This is the content I live for.
LOL Just what I would have done! :D)))))))
I miss this guy
Awesome lol
