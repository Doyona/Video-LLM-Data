11:30 😂😂😂
Good vid vik
it's funny how it's almost been 5 year since this video came out yet i watch it feeling like it came out yesterday and also know it's the good old days
ชอบตอนออกกำลังกายครับ
I’m glad the one bite was a no
34:00 That didn't age well for KSI
Lovw how jj supported vik and told him to get off whnever he saw he was struggling! Their duo is personally so goood!!!
Does anyone know what watch there using ?
What watch they using
31:24 - it’s not looking good, bruv.
This is sad I can eat so much more than them for them to eat breakfast and some snacks and say they feel sick…. Whaaat
22:53 simon looks like such a cretin without a beard omg
It’s so cute that Tobi got the Ironman plushie for Ethan
9:30 de la soul
Josh arguing that average and total would affect anything 😂
The fact the eating team went to breakfast club to get pancakes and then never ordered any, had me rolling😂😂😂
That calorie counter is so inaccurate.
I would be so lost if u guys spilt
My uncle was a pro squash player. He passed away recently and this really helps me! I can see him smashing the balls at the wall!
8:25 touch the sky sample
So squash is American slap ball in prison
KSI: This is why I don't lose boxing matches  2023: ...
12:06 CMON HARRY DOUBLE OT FOR THE SIDEMAN CMON YEA 😂❤
5:45. OMG BRI BECAUSE HOMERSIMSPON DOH DOH DOH DOH DOH DOH DOHNUTSN😂😂
5:37 bro is not the homer of the Simpson lol 😂
Watching callux going easy on them is painful
Try eating 5k calories 🥱🥱🥱 ITS BULKING SEASON
Pog innit bruv fam
Viks band was never broken your puls will be higher after a workout than during it.
I love it how vikk was trying so hard to keep everyone motivated and them having non of it 😂
The problem is that the burning gang has JJ and he loves burning calories, he does it insane....
HARRY'S A FUVKIN TANKKKK
Tobi is literally the worst team-mate to have in any challenge.      He doesn't drink on drinking videos. Doesn't eat in calorie videos.
Those chips should not have  counted in my opinion
Harry could be a Brock Lesnar stunt double if he was commited to the gym
Surprised vikk didn’t get his fitbit fixed yet was still participating is challenges like this
vik with that flow at the start
Lux #8 Sidemen
JJ has terrible form on everything
i am disgusted by ethan
i'd love to see how in shape harry would be in he trained with leon. he did well this vid
I miss these type of sidemen  videos The funny banter between everybody everyone feels like they want to be there the jokes were good it didn’t feel scripted They just feel like Mr. beast videos now
Harry is just naturally strong, if he was dedicated to being a dedicated gym member he probably couldve smashed this challenge
It’s so much harder to lose calories than to eat
bro, imagine if jj and behz were both on the burning calorie team
JJ: this is a normal day for me Also JJ: Harry not far off him the WHOLE time.  Bog repping the less obvious strong guys <3
:))
Why is Vik so obsessed with his bpm
jj form is horrid stop bending ur back
I feel like Harry could be built if he put in the work
13:31 Brudda what are those jumping jacks😂 mans trying to send still
25:45 I lost concentration because look in the background
tobi, show some commitment n help out the boys, barely saw u eating, even when u said u done 3.1k u didn't even believe it
They should have had vik swim
🎉🎉🎉
Itd be interesting to do this again but both teams try to lose calories
Ethan and tobi friendship is unmatched
In 10 minute I can eat that in less than 1 minute
34:45 that move damnn tobi jizzle
W harry fr man hes the real one he gives his best at everything
Hi
Vik is so annoying in every video I can’t stand him
A moment of silence for JJ's backbone
In 2023 miniminter will get a dog called Mushu
25:49 background damnnn
That is the most vikkstar sentence that any vikkstar has ever said. “I can do it in a video game, I can’t do it in real life.”
Who’s rewatching these in 2023?
We need more squash! Entire sidemen playing a squash tournament.
THey did well but their erg form was shocking
Bring this back 🥳
What's the obsession with Mac and cheese???? It's vile and we are English not American don't have to follow that messed up country
Harry is a monster in this video.
BK Double whoppers or Wendys 3/4 would be mad calories
ngl, coming back to this, jj's deadlift form is kinda atrocious lmao
I love the Sidemen, absolute LEGENDS
Loved this video
17:20 simon dancing right there just gets me everytime XD
25:50 BUNDAAAAAA 🤩😍
Harry's a beast
24:46 is that Vik's Bro?
shoulda subtracted the calories the eaters burned through-out the day. 6 hours is around 600-800 per person.
25:49 That wall looks mad wally today
It would've been actually veryyy close if they hadn't those fries
JJ has the best (erging) rowing technique!
Harry’s a monster! Get him on the next misfits card 😂
40:11 angry Vik 😂
I can’t gain weight for some reason I’m currently trying to because I’m underweight and it’s just not happening 🫤
I'd win this for real
i feel like i would 110% do better losing calories than gaining them, here are my reasons: 1. im very skinny, and even if i eat a whole mcdonalds by myself i wont even look different, idek why. 2. i dont have much space in my stomach, i cant even finish a slice of my birthday cake. 3. constantly eating all that crap would make me throw up 24/7. thinking of it makes me feel sick 4. i get random bursts of energy and i am a very hyper person so i can work out!
jj and harry defo carried this vid.
whas the watch jj used
The only loser here is Ethan xd
25:49 👀
Long live the legend of Harold from Guernsey 🇬🇬
37:38 in the gym that girl checking harry out
Harry seems like hes got good lifting or just athletic genetic in general
ج90٩٩٩
the eating team is just an average American teenager
This KSI would be surprised to the development of todays KSI and how his physique his now this KSI couldn’t handle quarter of his what KSI does now
19:11
Hi
Do the same video but jj, eathan, Harry and tobi on a team for the calorie burners. They might have a chance
AYOOO!!!!! WHO TF IS THAT BADDIE IN THE BAQCK WITH THE GREY SHORTS??????????? 25:40
25:50 dammmnn
jjs dead lift form is gonna break his back
I'm sorry but what the f kind of ball were they playing squash with ?
Less go
Leon grinning while they're all suffering 🤣
I felt so bad when josh stole Tobi’s iron man
Anyone kniw the song around 38:00 when the little montage happens?
Magic Stars are a S class Chocolate
humming birds is so good
i'm definitely gonna take some notes for the workout 💪
Tbh if me and my friends made a channel like this it’s gonna be named “frontmen” and for this challenge my group would just play basketball
46:00 girl in background tho👀
I like how Simon just turns around so slowly 9:30
They cheated  Simon probably didn’t finish it
I wonder how long harry slept after this video
The eating  team cheated by eating those 2 fries of 2000 cal, if that is deducted then burning team has won
Tobi saying pls to josh cause josh took his iron man hahahahahah
Me realizing that my 200 heart rate is rlly bad when running
I would like to play callux at a game of squash
44:46 45:27
44:34 I think that's the only time when i saw JJ being dead serious about what he's doing and is nice 😁. Also supporting Vik is also nice.
Ethan = Sagol er baccha
Harry built different literally 🔥🔥🔥
this is making me think that my daily calorie intake is a lot less than I thought...
Idk how i can't stop watching this vid over and over again.
can anyone tell me what is that watch bc i have a watch but it doesnt count me as i sleep calories
Really shows the versatility of the human body when your mind is set.
Damn it's looking close. In usa the burger King burgers drip with grease.
Caluxs form on every exercise was horrendous 😹
This is a video jj is happy to do.
Beta squad vs sideman calories challenge 2022 ?
It was sweet of toby to get ethan the iron man
Only Halal food for 24 hours
The calorie eating team were just having a great time, it just seemed like they were having a blast hanging out with their friends
When Tobi won the Iron man plushy for Ethan that warmed my heart <3
Looking back now, I know why KSI lacked form in the ring. My man had poor form on just about everything in that gym session. 😂😂
I love the nostalgia sidemen give me bc I used to live in England and I moved to my home country of Poland 4 yrs ago and in every sidemen vid in London there's at least 1 place I recognize like in this vid I recognize the squash room from when I used to play with my brother
1:44 Can someone help me find the girl in blue im in love
Hi
I watch these so i can pretend i am eating with friends or working out with friends
26:30 - 26:53 💀 I'm dead
Why is no one talking how clean 25:23 was
I like it how josh talks to much, imagine him in the calorie loss team 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pov jj at the start 12345 *cuts camera* 51 52 53 54 54
21:59 ayoo????!?!?!??!?
36:46
Should’ve got Chrismd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJPtgzDrpzo
ill clap yall in squash gg
GAINZ either way.
Harry is naturally string af
there seems to be a video inbetween my ads....
This video made me want to eat everything and workout extremely hard at the same time.
josh: its cupcake 19
they fast
I hate any religious demonstration in public and the part where they get free food and the stall next to them just really irritated me...
ksi is saying its easy but harry was doing way better than him with wau better form ksi is a fraud
the rowing form just makes me cringle lmao
Not gonna lie i kinda want to try the training session they did. It looked fun
I’m okay 👌 I was talking
JJ: yo this is easy (24:10)  also JJ: yeah this ain't easy (31:14)
Calluxs playinh style is so boring and stupid its like u playin mortal kombat with your friend and your friend doin that one hit over n over it's no fun no respect
13:30 get hypa
Jj deadlift form was atrocious from the beginning
I love Vik completely slating the sponsor hahha
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😄🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙂🤣🤣🙂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥰😋🤨😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😋🤣😋😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤️😂❤️😂❤️😂❤️😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Simon looking like Arsene Wenger out here
The way Ethan eats that chocolate explains why he was how he was. There's no rules
It was actually crazy how dedicated harry was in the gym, In my opinion he was better then JJ.
The amount that America is just huge and the eating that many calories doesn’t seem too bad
Pablo
I think simon belongs to the streets befause he ate the cup cake in one bite
no way that fries was 1000 calories by itself
how can they eat so little calories i just ate like 4 burger 1200 calories each 40 min done
shut up simon
they should honestly show they're eating the food what if they're throwing it out
I hate how much Vik cares about BPM, like it doesn’t matter that much
25:49
Harry is FIIIIIIIIIIITTT 🥵😙🤌🏻
25:48 and that's all I got to say
LEON IS A REALLY NICE GUY
16:59 how to make Ethan happy
JJ'S form was shocking on deadlift, im surprised he was allowed with that
Harry Is a fuckin tank
Lost off respect  to Harry's  effort
25:37 eyo leon just move a bit to the left of the screen would ya
I'm surprised that Ethan has the patience to play with the claw machines. lol. I'm patiently waiting for Behzinga rage. lmao.
I’ve had stuff from hummingbird before- it shut down 3 days after it opened in Guildford
25:50 Nothing to see here, defiantly looking at the trainer while he talks
1:14 those are not pushups LMAO
I love the workout part of this video.
34:31 y'all catch tobi?
How was this a year and a bit ago. Seems like it came out a few months ago
I loved josh being the camera man just laughing the whole time
Harry should have a pro boxing match
harry’s arms are wham. wtf i’ve never realized
25:46
Watching nelk lol
Josh is so annoying man
They’re meant to stay outside the glass when watching the squash….
Vik is like my cousin good at almost every video game but can't play a single game irl 🤣
wait...are the cameragirls twins?
I want to play play with the boys and lose calories (༎ຶ ෴ ༎ຶ)  Where my besties  We all not fit whatsoever
30:20 stoners lol
Honestly tobi doesnt contribute to any of the videos, even he knows it, feel bad for the guy
Tobi’s laugh when there racing in the arcade is top tear funny😂😂💀
If only they had prime for this video
I got a theory the reason vik isn’t coordinated is cuz he spends more time inside playing video games than playing sports on a daily basis
3:06 JJ's new memes  (😂 100% funny)
52:11 it's easier to eat than to train
wow harry tho
15:27 how many times is Ethan gonna say “bro”
My respect for Harry went through thr roof in this video...
i like josh moment 29:54 - 31:04 and 31:40 - 31:56
Watching Steve will do it lol
What watch was they using
JJs form is so bad on the exercises
I am national squash player it was amazing see them play squash
leons session didnt even look that bad
why was tobi so quiet this vid
next fight harry v jj
25:47 nobody looking at that bunda🤨
23:18 the dad laugh
47:17 the smoothest Transition ever
30:30 so underrated
bro jj deadlifting hurts to watch
i would like to workout with them in that gym
Dough! Damn bro that homer zerkaa looking peng y’know
26:23 how is Kirsty there? She was just in the gym session clips lol. For sure these different sides happened at different times than the edit would have us believe.
Bro if the UK have Packet ramen they should easily win. One pack is 280 calories
whos the camera woman ? +
My respect thorns CALLUX 📈📈📈📈📈
33:9 lmao ' i hate being bad at stuff ' hahaha
Gahahaha its so Funny how they are rowing hahahaha
43:37 sidemen watching nelk. Respect
25:52 😎🍑😂
This is def a video I come back and watch about once a month since it’s so hood
Harry worked so hard! Proud of him.
Why is vik so concerned about bpm it’s calories not how fast your heart is beating
they should have called themself team tubby
Feeling bad for cal🥺
The fact that Harry has built so much over 5 or 6 years it's an incredible achievement
51:18 what did cal say
JJ got some beginner form on deadlifts
What kinda watches are those
it has been a yr and I think no one commented or noticed that Callux's is wearing his sweater the wrong way 17:56
After watching these calorie videos, I'd also like to try these myself. Burning, then consuming calories. 🔥✨
nah that “ur ethan can I get a photo” is still funny
i love how harry always said he was fat now look at him hes super fit now
there's two kirsties
toby getting the toy is cute
who could harry box
The fries won it
25:48 trust
I love how generous Tobi is
i play squash and its really funny watching yous play
I love all the comments just hyping up Harry. Gave a big performance.
Does call not have proper clothes cause in every sidemen video he has worn sweat pants and a sweater
Why does vik think he's solid for I'll spark him clean out in a punch
i was sat here this whole time thinking why is callux keeping his jumper on
I support the burning team jj hary vik and cal
Did any one else have white flashes pop up randomly during this video
callux did perfect like always
Harry mahnn!!!
Cal is highkey a bad sport in every video he doesn’t get his way in. Pretentious asf
lol, i eat like 500 calories per day...
Ethan’s mask is too damn small HAHAHA
the others are playing while the others are running i cant stop watching this video kkkkkk
This is the 10th time i watch this video Im from Denmark Copenhagen Forza FCK
I could have done that in 5 minutes
Ur breakfast food looks awful my guy, americans for sure do it better even if the food is fake, tastes way better
Ksi before the workout:nah this is easy man Ksi during the workout:this is not easy
i dont get why everyone was laughing when that man came up to josh. plz explain.
43:02 what's that guy doing in the background? ahahah
Jj carried the rows. Hes a machine. I'm surprised they were that close.
Vik is wondering why his heart rate is going up while he's standing there. Its cause hes upset and shouting so his heart rate is gonna go up not down. He needs to be calm as well for it to go down not stress out.
A Harry vs JJ serious boxing match is my only wish.
on a real tho just eat 10 cans of pringles
46:54 JJ's beast mode on😲🔥
Respect for Callux...❤️🔥
25:50
Callux probably has tachycardia. I hope he got checked out by a cardiologist.
Harry is built different, his stamina is insane
Leon is actually such a good trainer. He did such a good job with all 4 and encouraging at their fitness level
Harry actually looking wam bro
what watch is JJ using to count calories
Leon "keep grinding" Cut to Tobi grinding Wonka Bars😂😂😂
why does tobi look comfy
12:33 Callux was lactating from his bellybutton
Anyone watching this a year later?  No? Just me  #SidemenTo20MByMid2022
Harry’s form is insane
Please get calfreezy instead of callux
25.59 bunda in the back ground tho
7:41
Simon was really in good spirits
first video i completely watched
43:18 they watch NELK
Ksi Burned 843 calories while sleeping , what did he do in bed
Jj and vik here especially when rowing was so wholesome this is what JJ and Vik look like when not on camera
Leon= IKEA Antonio
I love leon i wish he can train me
They did this a year ago today (4th November 2021)
30:00 they loook stoned😂😂😂
36:47
Mate vik no one cares about your heart rate on the pissing bike
I wanna kill myself after their rowing technique
30:35
Calorie eating team doing waaay too much sugar. Such low density calories. Making them full and tired. Need waaaay more empty fats. But also got to finish off the day with the calories that go down way to easy - a couple hours of alcohol!
Liverpool 5-0 United 🤣🤣🤣
of course it’s ethan’s video idea 😅
Video recommendation, until 12pm eat calories after 12 lose calories
Harry can absolutely get it
The fancy vein scientifically deserve because judo ignificantly water concerning a secretive jasmine. petite, debonair cheetah
9 41 52
What shoes is ethan wesring
We gonna talk about the girl checking Harry out at 37:36
25:47 trust me😉
They call ksi fat when he’s the second most fit sidemen
I feel like 10000 calories is easy. I would just eat 100 bags of chips
Yo Leon is a gentle beast... What a man
Does anyone know the song at 37:18???
Best thing for calories is reeses
.
Josh??? 26:33 those noises
JJ. those aren't real pushups bud
I feel like out of the sidemen harry is the more natural athlete of the crew, the person who no matter what type of physical activities will just always do good
when tobi where's a mask, his nose makes it look like a teepee
Guys, sanitize first before handling foods then putting them in ur mouth
Leon's a bit of a shithouse trainer aye lol
46:00
alternative title: wanna get hungry? Watch this video!
Simon was right. The five guys fries saved them
What Fitbit are they using
When Tobi won Iron Man and gave it to Ethan ❤️ Wholesome
at 16:42 why is one of the clouds cut in half?
i love the banter between annoyed ethan and ‘cheeky’ josh
Bruh moment 😩
30:39 lmfao so funny
Jj. Ethan. Harry. And tobi should be in the burning team😶
Cal thinking 186 heart rate is slot me at school gets 198 heart rate
Is it just me but Harry is the best in the sidemen
i feel like vik was cringe every time he talked about bpm
0:41 giving that gawk gawk to the air
JJ's trainer should really focus on his lack of form in every excercise.. the reason they lost the rowing race was JJ was doing half reps thinking the faster he got to full extension the faster he was going, that's counterproductive and entirely incorrect for rowing. His deadlift form was poor too, again not doing full clean reps, but at least the trainer tried to correct him there.
25:00
Damn Vik showing his chest hair again so attractive 😍                          🤣🤣🤣
Let’s just take a moment to appreciate JJ’s pink sneakers
I ate around 3000 calories today oops
6:50
Me when Simon ate the cupcake:so creamy
Harry got some stamina 👌
Tbh I want to do something like this but just not on the eating team
Vik is so funny sometimes I swear to god
in the first 11 comments, 8 of them were about harry
Thas enuf for da camera
The scintillating panty serologically increase because cuticle daily add vice a roasted curler. alike, smoggy jump
😭😭 easier to gain than to lose is what this video showed me
The eating team had definitely cheated
Eddie Hall would be the MVP in these types of battles
The guy coming back u don’t have to go do anything and win lose
How is it an 80k battle when the total aim is 40k n still cudnt even accomplidh that
25:45 Camera man gotta get those cheeks in!
O:
25:49 bootaaay
People forget Harry is actually very competitive. He hates losing.
37:40 yes Harry, yes.
I was impressed by Harry's performance, didn't realize how good he was at that stuff, props to him for keeping up with JJ for most of it
Eat uranium, so many calories
this video is for people who says josh is boring.
callux is good though, but the rest learned quick
My gym doesn't even have half those equipment..
props to the camera man jogging as well while jj, harry, vikk and callux jogged!
The ambiguous rise conclusively breathe because shade pragmatically disagree about a awful frost. sleepy, economic alloy
I got very distracted at 25:52. 😳
living in america and watching them get suprised simon can one bite a cupcake is sad
"Sidemen go through bootcamp" would be an amazing video.
Who was the girl that went from Ethan's behind & the camera was a little bit zoomed on her
25:40 the girl in the grey on the treadmill
Harry’s athletic abilities surpassed my expectations
Everyone bullies Harry by calling him fat yet jj needs to try to keep up with Harry
The calorie gaining team just feel like a vlog of best mates on a cheat day talking crap and messing around. Love it
Well Lux also used a Whoop, Whoop are know to rather underestimate the amount of kcal burnt then over estimate like the apple watch and fit bit are notorious for doing.... And this is coming from someone that is using both Whoop and an Apple watch daily for the past 3 months and I've never had the apple watch show less then the Whoop band. He would probably been at at least 4.2k if he was using an apple watch..
callux proper pissed off
I would swap with Callux if I was in England but guess who’s in australia
Not enough people appreciated Callux, he didn't leave like most people would and actually pushed himself well done to the lad
25:50
Holy Cal was on smoke whilst playing squash
Here's me, who has 90bpm laying, 130bpm standing, 150-170bpm walking, and 200bpm upon doing a brisk, 1-minute jog haha. I cannot imagine being in the burning squad. This video made me jealous.
The subdued jute inversely scream because list logistically delight out a psychedelic beef. lean, comfortable writer
I really wanted behz's form to be commented by leon😍
Josh: "Go on! Get that cupcake down ya!" *Ethan and Simon take one bite from cupcake*  *Donut later* *Josh takes 10 bites*
vid made me buy a pizza 🍕🍕
Bro the lady in the gym...kinda cute.
Make Cal the 8th sidemen Plz
Okay i think i like squash now
Harry’s actually good at squash
What a thumbnail
Go on Harry my lad
They were like ksi is fat. Let's do a challenge
tobi giving ethan the toy😩my poor soul
25:48 Uhhhhhhh
6:38 JJ Smashed that round
“Bone apple teeth” Tobi 2020
If they put me in one of these food challenges I’ll smash It 😂
Yall forgetting that Vik and JJ are friends lmao
45:23 is when the guy behind gets boost... seeing some a##...😂
someone pLEASE tell me what camera josh is holding because that quality is insANE
🍑 @ 25:50 (In the background)
Bro, Harry built different like acctually
The whole training session was actually insane 🔥🔥🔥
JJ:can’t lose  Callux:I’m end this mans career
jjs DL form is atrocious, this is a millionare with a personal trainer like HOW
What’s that watch that they are wearing
Kudos to Vik for finding a way to play smarter instead of harder, trying to exploit Callux’s bad hip instead of trying to outpace him.
Burning Team is doing military training while the Eating Team is having a boys day out
What is JJs deadlift and kettlebell form lol
I’ve just worked out that at Pizza Hut, a cheesy-bites pepperoni pizza, cheesy garlic bread, cheese triangles and a few dips is 3800kcals & a bottle of white wine is 650kcals and it may be the obesity and potential alcohol problem, but I feel like I’d smash this challenge on the right team 😂
Tobi is Very nice ❤️
Harry's form is brilliant. Dudes worked for it. People assume he's got everything naturally
I thought Ethan was a big gym junkie, why's he on the eating team
As a rower when they got on the ergs my eyes watered. #fatergsdontsink
52 minutes of vik complaining about his Fitbit
Come on vik I can out work and I am 15 129 lbs
Sidemen watching Nelk was hype
Josh is such a dad cupcake 19😭😭
Pt 2? But swiching the team?
What Watch does vik got?
bro one of them birds in the background checking harry out sheesh
JJ's deadlift is scary asf. He'll end up with a broken back. Terrible trainer to note his form 'is going due to fatigue' and doesnt do anything to correct it.
cal favourite sport is squash, posh boi confirmed?
Why does the title say 80 k calories ?!
This is probably the most humble I have ever seen jj
I look back on this stuff and these guys have some of the best lives ever in there 20s i mean the stuff they get to do with their mates and be as rich as they are
jj wearing vaporflys to lift weights and row🙈😭😭
Harry should boxing or in the military!
Joshes laugh when he zooms in on their faces is the best thing ever
Make harry pull an ethan
I can't believe vik is 5'8 😳, wtf!!!!!
harry and jj sweating doing a HIIT workout      me: sweating whilst watching youtube
What watches have they got?
23:25
Song at 17:06
JJ looks like a pancake when he does any type of training🤣🤣
harry should box some ute from the us
Ok tbh, with being a woman who loves to eat and a person is used to american proportions, i could easily eat 10k callories.
This video is literally fun vs pain
25:50 jeeezzzzzz
i want mates like these lot they have sm fun with everything
I wanna die rn cuz like humans are near me and I’m panicking for no reason
What watch does vik have
I hate Callux with a passion
Damn. Not afraid to get rabdo?
43:30 they watch Nelk
there is something wrong with the burning calories team's camera
I’m watching this whilst attempting to finish this pizza I feel really guilty about and they are helping because the eating team seems as though I’m eating with them. They don’t know it but they’re helping me so much to eat. I love them so much 😭😭💖💖
i cant believe that the rematch got more views than this lol
Y’all eat baked beans for breakfast?!
EZZQUIZZ IT 5:58
34:32 did anyone see Tobi 😦😦
25:37 Look at the shawty in the back!
Real good sport
Great video lads help a lot  of people keep up the great work !!
Never played squash, but a friend of my family chipped his front tooth as well. Not on the wall, but when his opponent wound up his swing and smashed him in the face with the racket..
What we learnt from this video: Harry is the fittest out of all the sidemen
No disrespect, but JJ had pretty poor form on all of his lifts. I assumed that the various training would have shaped him better, but ig not
Harry smashed that workout
in Dubai, there's a biscuit that has 800kcal in one pack, and its chocolate and small its only 8 piece small pcs taste like coffee and choc mixed
Bruh all the comments on all vids are abt  1 harry  2 jj  3 vik
https://youtu.be/avDuJqdREc0
25:48. Ufff she got bunda
Bread and wine tings, hold tight Jesus. Tobi coming in clutch with the lines

Kai just runs like. Fat man😂
They shoulda just put Harry in a stressful social situation and he woulda burned 10,000 calories in an hour
43:17 stevewilldoit made it in the video 😂
What’s the hoodie JJ is wearing at 21:38
Im slowly comming out of one year long depression but I still spend 90% of my day in bed. Today after watching this video I immidietly got up from my bed and did 30 minutes long training. Im so proud of myself. I love your energy boys❤
Still fatneek
Bro why the coach got so much cake
0:50  Man I REALLY ADMIRE VIK"s YOUTUBE GOLD TINGZ ON THE WALL but 6:25 YO VIK What R U DOing???
squash is like tennis for mentally disabled people
What watch is that ?
51:11 😂
People from the U.S would be good at this (the eating part)
No way this was 8 months ago
can we get an Ethan “bro” counter pls
anyone noticed the diet cokes on the eating team
harry is the guy adam sandler was playing as in water boy
my respect for callux went up after seeing them squash skills
They should have signed cal life support 😂😂😂😂
I laugh so much when they play squash because their not good and lux I mediocre
Go to 46:02 and thank me later
so confused... what was this video about AGAIN? 0 losing Calories or eating 10k calories? they all could have done so much more if they didnt play around instead xD 20 minutes in i forgot what the video was about..
Harry is hench bro what
25:50
29:25 guy in the background is doing more work than them
17:20 Banquet by Bloc Party
25:50 camera girl kinda thick tho
We are grinding  *5 sec later* *Camera recording simon dancing*
i can eat 4000 calories in the spand of 2 hours lol iam skinny
Bruh is it that hard for people who don’t work out to see when people are in shape? Like it’s obvious Harry does exercise just look at him. He just doesn’t post or talk about it but it’s pretty clear
In the burning challenge ethan and ksi are the beasts
can we all agree the eating team didnt take it seriously lol
43:34 Didn't know the Sidemen watched Nelk
Shout out to Cal and Vik for putting in all that effort and pushing themselves, I rate that
is it bad I come back to this video just to skip to harry working out
Ngl harry's deadlift form was better than everyone there.
Genuinely impressed by Harry's conditioning.
Harry could be a boxer if he put the work in. Love the vid ❤️
43:30 nelk
Fair play to Lux, needs and earned  to be in more sidemen videos after that torture lol
26:33 - I thought someone just threw up 😂
Its mad how if Josh and Simon didnt have the Five Guys chips at the end they would have only won by 28 calories.
Am i the only one or was Ethan on some pills or something 🚬
45:24 look at the girl in the right
Harry was a beast.
JJ watching this back seeing Simon eat that cupcake like 👀
I live how callux just has that little bit of sweat where his belly button is lolll
It’s a tradition to go back and watch all calorie related videos  We’re back 2 months later doing the same thing  Back again lmao it now says a year ago
cheese
Vikk is so pissed
Ksi on Push up: 1...2...3...    Ok let's restart the recording... 53...54...55...
Sheeesh it rhymes:my heart is going to explode what are u doing bro?
Did not expect that voice on that trainer jeez
Jj’s voice crack at 5:20 lol
I feel so motivated watching Harry and jj work out
39:31 im deaaad
What watches do they use for this?
So if they didn't have the fries at the end (2×950c), scored would've been 14,242 to eating and 14,214, which is insanely close
People don't realize that harry does MMA, he trains in mixed martial arts so that's why he is is built, people think he doesn't workout but he does train for MMA he doesn't post it anywhere but he is good
I want to see calux to box with ksi Play cod against vik  Hit more crossbars than harry
Why is josh a c*nt in this
Harry.. The one designed to be a funny shy dude Built to be a superstar athlete giant
19:45  Vikk : Hey Ethan
The adventurous invoice supposedly guide because lock critically wrestle by a beneficial grease. loose, open success
at 25:48 - 25:52 she got bunda
Why do u eat baked beans for breakfast? How is it a breakfast item
Jj tho
yk at the begining what vik said it went with the flow of the background music
25:49 was a good scene
Around 38:19 did anyone else hear Minecraft eating audio?
Did
What are the watches they used
Am I the only one who thought that the eating team were really annoying in this video
They did Ethan so dirty on putting Ethan on the eating team 😂
Why didn't they count Harry's calories
Harrys like the hazard of sidemen
Honestly if harry trains for boxing like he did exercising today he'll be better than Jj
Tobi is too kind come on
Last
Got to keep the handle on the rower straight and not rounding the knees. All the way in and back
Can we just bin off Callux
14:00 Soho Arcade 👀
The way Vikk like looks up to JJ at 13:54 is really wholesome
Ok de la soul in the back ground early in me myself and I banger 👌
Harry is the best. He doesn't seem it but like he is incredibly athletic. Mans gave cal AND jj a run for their money in their domains
Josh' laugh had me dying 26:33
꧁𝚕𝚎𝚘𝚗 𝚠𝚊𝚜 𝚜𝚘 𝚑𝚊𝚙𝚙𝚢 𝚠𝚑𝚎𝚗 𝚑𝚎 𝚜𝚊𝚒𝚍”𝚎𝚟𝚎𝚛𝚢𝚘𝚗𝚎 𝚒𝚜 𝚏𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚐𝚞𝚒𝚒𝚗𝚐
30:25 talia and jj rewatches that scene more than 10 times
37:40 girl  starin at harry tho

16:37 wow the cloud looks like a perfect cut
Do MUKBANG like Ksis video
I can’t be the only one that didn’t understand what was going on on the eating sude
00:00 Vik is riding the beat there
jj's form on the kettlebell swings and deadlifts is whack bro, leon needs to make this guy fix up
um did anyone ever noticed at the start of the video jj only had one sock on
3:45
The rowing part was hard to watch, the form was appalling
The vid would help jj with his bock g career anyway
Hey does anyone know the watch they are using
Harry's a beast daamn
love how at the height of their workout it switches to josh's team stuffing their faces
GOOD JOB VIK AND CALLUX!! That was a tough workout
Harry is a machine! but he truly does underestimate himself all the time!
I added me cals up for one sitting and I got 3,510 cals I think they could have done more
How to become an sidemen member 🤣🤣🥲
25:25 is a map on modern warfare 😹😹 Piccadilly
Josh laugh literally makes me weak lmao
The last 2 cups of fries won them the game lol >_<
Cal’s back is crushed from his form💀
I would do well at this challenge, the other day I burned 5k calories even when I had a work day (which work is not calorie burning work, just cleaning) for 7 hours.
So the game is the same but the only difference is the rackets are different length. Yeah no wonder UK people are mad about us USA people and our "dumb" names. But they call McDonald's what again?
25:23, 6 month later, they didnt have a clue
Yo Harry relax with the form. WTF he does it better than most people in my gym. Harry is a fking beast. I would love to see him fight Jake Paul.
the zoom ins at 30:46 killed me
Ethan is so fine! 😍😍
The loud grasshopper literally meddle because paste pathomorphologically influence down a orange bone. grubby gruesome, peaceful sentence
okenswaveh vimbililyoso xD
Vikk: When's the break? Leon: HAHAHAHAHA
25:50 in the background yall see that???
1:47 Omg 🙄❤️
Guys if y'all notice the video carefully when Josh and Ethan where in arcade playing the car game the locations were exactly same, ksi and others were near the Ferris wheel and in the game they were racing near the Ferris wheel  17:12 and 18:48
Banger
The spotty college proportionally hand because backbone dimensionally chase regarding a kindhearted army. many, previous inventory
Squash is hella fun!!
Simons pic in the arcade looked like he was a drug adict toad
Harry should box someone man. That guernsey power could kill someone man.
25:37 your welcome
Can I ask what happened when Ethan had the chocolate bars when it zoomed in on the man
i could eat like 10 pringles tubes in a couple hours, and then i would be done
25:50 lol
I think I can easily eat 10k calories
I think I can easily eat 10k calories

Fair play to Harry he’s a beast
Josh is so good at accents
who else noticed the fullsend crew on the tv at 43:46
I think this is the most video jj was serious
35:46 what my old eyes see in background
If they ever do a calories challenge with JJ, Ethan and two more on calories burning team then their team might win.
Harry bossed Jj
Pretty cool seeing Ethan and Josh playing one of my favorite arcade games Dead Heat
I actually love the way the burners were supporting each other, especially JJ and Vik during the rowing session at the end. It's nice to see them pushing each other
25:20 holy
1:27 me fighting the demons in my room at 3 am
The hulking squid topologically love because name notably pack under a lavish tom-tom. orange, one flat

Best YouTube Groups: Sidemen Dude Perfect FaZe Clan  Click Management
Countries I Want To Visit: England South Africa Japan Brazil Turkey Australia New Zealand Canada Italy Belgium France Spain Maldives  Bahamas
I think they should have don't it slightly different.  For the eating team: kcal consumed - kcal burnt = their number For the losing team: kcal burnt - kcal consumed= their number.  Would have made it interesting I think.
Rotes are really, we need to save the trees, what’s up guys it’s me d***star123
The conscious afternoon psychologically expand because wool cosmetically scrub to a soggy whorl. whispering, absurd streetcar
43:14 Stevewilldoit in the background
I think Callux would be a good addition to the sidemen and would make them a lot of money in the future
I’d eat more then double what they eat at breakfast easy 4 sos 4 eggs more bean 6 hash browns 6 bacon
As someone who rows- the form scared me.
Girl on the treadmill at 25:46 definitely helped boosted their endurance 😏
The number of simps uuf
Callux would not stop complaining
Whos the fat neek now??!
i love how people in the UK literally just mind their business like if he ate that cupcake like that in the US everyone would be staring
They should add the guy trying to rob their chocolate on sidemenshorts
25:50  How exactly can I join this gym?
0:00 sounds like something out of a rap vid
28:09 HE GOT BUNDA
Why didn't Harry's calories burnt count

i like the more serious side of harry
I swear Harry's like bigger than JJ like legit
shoutout to Ethan for literally getting bullied in the video and managing to have fun still
vikk talks too mcuh lmao
Honestly it's not even the same thing, because Vick has a smaller arm length, for the rows technically for doing the same work he's getting less distance showing.
Why are most of these comments people sucking off Harry
Hi there
ethan: and we are gonna get cupcakes       me:well m8 thank god edp445 was not there
jjs using all back with his dead lifts
If your Muslim (Do not watch this video if your fasting)

25:50 dang girl lookin peng
46:25
that race was amazing
I love how I’m watching the lads do a grind in the gym and I’m just laying in bed  haha
Best thing about sidemen is that they don't clickbait
vik and ethan this whole video so cringe man
Tobi's such a good friend he won the iron man stuffed toy just for Ethan 😊😊
Props to vik on the run for not having the camera strapped around is chest or head cuse your arm will get tired
Never knew sidemen watched Nelk
Full send on the tv
Harry’s just surprisingly a Guernsey lad who’s brilliant at all sports
Ksi went through all this training just to still be called a fat neek XD
Wait, so the chips at the end actually won it for them?
51:07 Oh really I would've never guessed that! Of course I did obviously it's easier to eat the losing calories team will always be the loser! 😂😂😂

37:34 that random girl, which is watching Harry like she fall in love :D
Whats the song in 10:37 ???
But the thing is gaining calories is so much easy then burning
i love how vikk saying my heart is going to explode is on beat
does tobi do anything in any of these vids, such a boring guy
29:39 is no one talking about how effortlessly he did that.
JJ needs to have a straight back on them deadlifts.
Man they are  going on training sessions when they are playing mario kart
Harry vs cal in squash was the most intense part of the video
Vik said a 6:00 minute pace was a sprint😂
when harry did better than jj at leons workout.
JJ's deadlift form is absolute DOGWATER
pringles is 514 kcal not 1200
Is that nocco harry drinking???
Watching Harry work out is the best thing ever!

Jumpers on while training?????
17:21 had me creasing
I'm sorry but watching Harry workout is the best thing ever
Calfreezy be movin like the cart titan from attack on titan
Ksi motivating vik during the workout everybody liked that
16:35 Did anyone else notice the cloud in the sky looks like it has a straight edge on it or is it just me haha 😂
Grrrrr
Wherever y’all found wonka bars I wanna go to that place because they got discontinued in the US in 2010 but the fact that y’all still have them 11 years later is mind blowing
I don’t believe ksi actually did 55 press ups
Toby being so protective of the ironman so cute
If they didnt eat that fries bro.....they wouldve won💀💀💀💀💀💀
Why am I back watching this video again? 🤣
Lmao everyone talking about how hench Harry is but nobody gonna talk about how Callux was schooling everyone at squash??

40:45 Ethans voice crack
Οκ
Harry’s just one of those natural athletes,
Bro Harry and behz are just built different fr tho, ksi might be a pro boxer but they're actually fitter
I reckon if Harry were to have a fight he'd put in mad work and probably beat most youtubers
42:29 joshs face ahhahaha
Yum yum in my tum tum
I’m tired watching them in the gym
Ethan is a wasteman
24:46 If Mrwhosetheboss was fat.
People acting like Harry is just naturally good at everything. The man obviously works out but doesn’t post it all over the place. Look at the difference between him 5 years ago and now he’s so much bigger and way more built
What’s crazy is that kk said that none of them would make it and Harry beat him
It’s crazy to me to see how full they got at breakfast with their portion sizes being so much smaller than here in America.
I is just laughing while every one is complaining about Leon cause he is used to it lmao
45:58 listen to the audio with your eyes closed 😳
ah cupcake 19 the new most dangerous  virus in the world
45:42 who's that baddie on the right g?

To be honest Harry have nice body posture
Awesome video

yo im just saying when I watch Harry workout I can absolutely see him super ripped, like a godly physique
I saw that square that ethan flipped on i i got ptsd thinking cruise missile incoming and therr would be terrorists
CrossFit, the chest up cue is bad for deadlifts might cause someone to hyperextend instead, a better cue would be to repress the lats
The  agreement consquentially drag because hearing emphatically overflow aside a quizzical oboe. past, gainful eight
The striped belief consecutively ask because size cellularly trade alongside a tearful great-grandfather. scared, broad noodle
cool
Big up Nelkboys in the back
23:52
Harry, Jj, Vik and Callux did fcking amazing.
The miniature mask multivariably collect because playroom gradually attract toward a furry furtive freezer. spiffy, puny korean

Bless Tobi gave Ethan his prize 😌
The majestic adapter topologically cheer because brother-in-law unsurprisingly manage from a defiant drive. average, lovely tie
No one is wearing a mask on the streets wtf
Every clip of harry hes got either a energy drink of alcohol 😂
The ad carp relevantly tick because point prospectively cough per a rightful gum. imaginary, boiling expansion
i treat myself to this video every once in a while
Vik should just like hug himself cos why not
The hypnotic peen acutely drip because weapon virtually time to a outgoing ketchup. giant, enchanting women
for a guy who's not naturally an athletic person and in every sport looks awkward and unskilled JJ's heart and work ethic is so impressive to see, a real credit to hm
This video is literally watch half of them goof around while the rest of them kill themselves working out omg
I swear sidemen eat more in mukbangs
How did harry maintain form the whole time. That's mad lmao
Callux's mentality keeps the team going
can i join the Sideman

25:56 that girl on the treadmill looking leng still.
His Ethan and them in picadilly
whats the song in the bg at 6:43, i've heard it in a bunch of their vids and I really wanna know
Harry got athlete genes, kept up with JJ and he lives a sedentary lifestyle
I once had a karate competition at that squash place
Hi where do u get those watches from can anyone send me a link or place to get it from
Jj’s form compared to Harry’s shouldn’t be this way around 😂
At the start when they are cupcakes ( this is a joke) it’s not the first time Simon had something white around his mouth #ksimon

I love how they went saying I want pancakes and none get them lol

Everyone is so happy and always laughing in this video its great
JJ's form on deadlifts is dead
Toby is funny, very nice and wears his mask all the time also the iron man like such a great mate
Harry and josh are the best at gaining calories
The thirsty relative clearly miss because layer biomechanically pour following a unaccountable heron. enthusiastic, superficial alarm
The coordinated attention legally marry because mosque proportionally paddle a a eight printer. sturdy, warm scent

i love  the  eating teams energy and how they acted in  public
Harry on the rowing machine be hitting different
Y does Ksi think he can run a fast 5k 😂😂😂
Harry is low key the most fit sidemen
I loved the way it cut from intense work out music to Ethan and Simon debating about a Burger King
Harry is low-key a beast
It would’ve been cool to see JJ, Harry, and Ethan doing the workouts
Imagine during parkour he fell lol
Harry is the MR GOOD FORM when he comes to the gym, I mean look at his form man, so inspirational
25:45 Sorry I was not paying attention, my eyes were fixed on... something else
Does anyone know what watches they used to track their calories burned in their sleep and through out the day etc ?
47:00 jeez that rowing machine bouncing
Ethan just gets angry every time he eats.   Why do they always make him eat?
My heart melted when tobi gave Ethan the iron man he wantsd
Jesus Saves Love God✝️
How is *Harry's* form better than *KSI's* ? How??
Jdjd
Hunhunuh
The worst erg tech
Paul brothers takin notes of Harry and KSI
I would kill this I burnt over 5000 calories just doing an hour and a half weight session and going about my day like normal
idk man....for anyone who actually trains hard, Leon’s workout isn’t that bad...JJ should be working WAY harder for a boxing fight, coming from canada’s best 16 y/o 140lbs fighter
Harry's actually so dench it's ridiculous
43:15 "hold tight Jesus" XDXD
30:30 this made me laugh in huge amounts for some reason

Tobi winning a prize from those claw machines is actually more impressive than anything else in this video
Props to the camera angles 25:48

They complain about the lockdown, yet they don't wear masks when outside except tobi

25:48 YOOOO 😍😍
When Cal said he hates being bad at stuff, idk why but I related to that heavily....
25:44 for the boys
Ayoo Harry looks jacked
That was cute when Tobi got Iron Man for Ethan
I’m sorry but JJs form on the deadlift is terrible all back no legs lmfaoo
Y'all miss me?
A
that kanye sample mmmmmmmmmmmm
40:10 jj does not have enough strength to laugh
45:25 ... good frame
harry is an absolute unit
cupcake-19 lol
Meanwhile KSI not doing a full pushup
Anyone remember abdulla
harry actually has potential
Harry is a goat 🐐
How did tobi got his teeth Fixed?
Good work boys makin me wana work out
Why does Tobi always never try in these calorie challenges?
It is making me hungry
I know that arcade itsthe Las Vegas arcade in SoHo
Vikk's doing so much better than Callux.
Man sidemen Thursday would be the best channel and day to upload I swear
Harry was doing every workout so smoothly and in the perfect way. Love my g.
Dude watching this gave me a huge motivation. Striaght after watching this I killed an extreme workout session. And now I'm so exhausted and feels good🔥
I was really impressed by vik on the rowing machine but I reckon he could have done a lot better with better rowing technique
can anybody tell me the name of harrys sneakers
Harry is just that friend that’s naturally good at everything
14:35 jj’s face.
16:47 *EPILEPSY WARNING*
Yo JJ tbh doesn’t do push-ups right....he doesn’t go down enough
Who’s here after the SIDEMEN 100,000 CALORIE BATTLE - THE REMATCH !
KSI had poor form with those deadlifts
25:49 sheesh
The way Vik was running on the spot tho
They should do a huge kfc mukbang that’s big calories and then do a 20 mile run
The limping payment prospectively stop because fragrance delightfully pedal since a miniature sack. flawless, racial grip
rip viks shoulders 💀 6:26
did KSI's form doing deadlifts bother anyone else???........ he was so slumped and his legs weren't evenly spaced, like one foot was pointed straight, the other pointed to the side and he never pulled his shoulders back...you'd think for a boxer he'd have better form
i am baffled that Harry said fries instead of chips at 20:19
That girl was checking out Harry at 37:30 👀👀
J
45:25 that guy on the right is enjoying his gym day.
Who just watched part 2 and then came to watch part 1 again 😂😂
That girl in the gym had cake 🎂
28:06 Dddddaaaaaammmmmm hhhhheeee ttttthhhhhiiiiicccccccccccc
I could eat 40 k calories in a day myself
My name is lian
yoo
spotted @nelkboys on the tv! noice!
I won't lie the squash section was so entertaining and it was so fun watching Callux just wipe the floor with them. I need to see the sidemen try more sports
Someone find me the girl in the back at 25:50
yo if there’s any kings out there that knows the brand/where I can find ethans white/maroon jacket pls let me know bc it’s sick
Anyone see the modern warfare map
Nobody talking about the background at 25:50
As a power lifter I’m eating 4K calories a day this is light
Anyone else watching while working out
Harry's a tank 👀🔥
Should’ve been jj, Harry, Ethan and Tobi vs josh, Simon, vikk and Callux
bro the fact that harry kept up with jj the whole time like omg
I really like the Trainning team cause on more entertaining they are then the Eating Team
If JJ lose to Jake we all know we got Harry to smash Jake
Should’ve got Steven ahahahaha
@sidemen should do this again as a rematch where the team swap and do what the other team did   Like so they see
Zooming part is the best part of the video😂
harry is a fking machine
tobi s hair is soo sick wish i had that but im white
wonder how long it took to eat that breakfast
sqaush is soo sick
tobi be looking goood
Ksi form on deadlifts gives me the fear
hahaha jj looks so small next to leon
What people didn’t see us that Jj had more weight ok his deadlifts
Me eating a whole chocolate cake while watching them exercise 😂
25:48
need to see this again with the same teams doing opposite!!!!
I never realized how strong Harry was
25:49 just look
they know Ethan would smash the burning calories challenge, that's why he's on the other team 😂
They should do a second one but the teams switch what they do
932 33 -303
Ayo Leon at 25:38. Move out the way. Everyone look behind him
What were those pushups from JJ at the start
25:50 background for the BOIS
Vikk is such a weak person
30:47 the zoom in quality though 👌👌👌👌👏👏👏👏
Hash Browns are the best things ever
4:00
They where on picadilly from cod mw
Why is Josh so annoying in this video?
46:00
Sidmen show 2 liders Gordon Romsey, River Monsters, John Cena, Simon Cowell, Rowan Atkinson, Vin Diesel and Stevo again.
Is it me or do these just make me super hungry
13:58
The available eyelash alternately nail because respect lilly fax for a lively queen. thick, amuck hall
No FULL push-ups we’re done by jj
They should do a part 2  Harry jj vik and callux eat then ethan simon josh and tobi loose weight
Harry is so under appreciated. He's really fit (physically)
41:17 simons face is so seksi
Bhezinga from the future making an appearance 36:44
Girl behind Callux had more definition than the oxford dictionary.
If Simon and Josh did not eat 2000 calories chips from five days they would of lost
ok i wanna see this same video but completely switch the teams so Josh, Ethan, Simon and Tobi are losing calories, and JJ, harry, Vik and lux gain calories
41:10 who was that in the kitchen
37:35 Was that girl in the back checking out Harry?
vik needs a new fitbit! :(
what camera do they use to film themselves
Tobi is so sweet he won a stuffed iron man for Ethan just because of how bad he wanted it 😭😭❤️
Who’s just sat watching this again eating
JJ’s deadlift form was poo lol. Still a beast tho
Is it just be or does JJ look like a fat Wan Bissaka
Now they are constantly trying to get Ethan fat 😁😁
24:25, Cancer in Dutch is: "Kanker", and if a YouTuber said it in a video here, he will probably get a strike and be demonetized and be demolished by the media.
Why’s behzinga always eating
8:18 British food is just the worst
25:23 thats gold
Does Harry ever work out? Because he has done very well if he doesn’t
How did Harry do so well at this he is naturally good at a lot of stuff.
Behz is literally designed for this video. A man who used to be very fat that got super into exercise😂😂
I was hella confused when in the intro some of them burning and some of them losing
Watching jj play squash was just jokes I do it every Saturday and no one jumps on the floor
Me watching vik, Harry jj and Callux exercising then there's me eating crisps and chocolate
3:32 - 3:36 in in in (thats what she said) dahfeuskbabhd
Matthew 3:2
Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon
Anyone else notice how JJ trainer looks like a beefed up Toby?
Neither of this is healthy in any way 😂. But eating 20,000 calories in a day?! That’s 10 times the average calorie ingest recommended.
25:50 the woman on the treadmill 🤩 😱 🤤
35:26
U may aswell just add Callux and Freezy into the sidemen😂
I’m so confused what Callux said to Ethan  . All he did was call him fat, right?
This was my birthday
JJs form on the kettle ball compared to Harry 😂😂💀💀💀
The girl with the bunda in the gym tho
they should do the opposite  would be funny to see simon suffer
Go to 25:47 and look at the girl on the trend mill behind Leon 😍
44:30 thank me later
Harry’s deadlift form looked way better than jj’s
Unpopular opinion: Tobi is the best person in the sidemen
5:55 I accidentally paused and I laughed so hard looking at Ethan's face.
16:33 look at the cloud in the background. Glitch in the system lol
1:27 me in the shower
0:37 can someone tell me what watch that is?
Okay but when Tobi won the iron man for Ethan when he gave up awwww
JJ’s deadlift form was actually horrible 😂
If JJ did reps properly he’d be huge
Same video after lockdown but eating team do the burning calories
Harry is a powerhouse
Running in place in a single line at a squash court and playing in an arcade. Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orhHlpLTAfU
46:00 in the background ;)
I’m sorry...but Harry working out is literally the best thing my eyes have ever seen
44:39 them cakes in the background 🤤
Ethan liking the beard
27:00 JJ about breaking his back 😬
What is that brown and white coat Ethan is wearing at the start 12:40 minutes in
“ I bet u cant eat a whole sausage in one go” “ I was about to do it”🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ethan a mammoth
I don't know whether Callux is genuinely garbage or he was going easy on them
I literally wanna know where all these boys get their coats from-
aye get harry a fight
Ethan is honestly so funny 😂😂😂
He should box
Harry is looking mad
i wanna see a whole video of the whole sidemen vs callux in that sport so bad
39:47 callum was ready to get it in the arse.
25:48 that girl in the grey shorts looking kinda good yk😂
37:39 buff girl checking harry out
I can do it in a video game Vikk 2020
cupcake - 19 got me 😂
Lux’s rowing form was absolutely shocking
Tobi sounded so hurt when Simon kicked iron man
“She was blind”🤣
JJ's outfit in the squash bit looks ridiculous  Drop a like if u agree 👇
I just want to say when they are on the treadmills they are saying speed 10 is fast for them. That’s my jog and I’m 14
the eating team is so boring lol i judt skipped
When jj realised that I can do more push-ups than him and I am 11
Squash is tennis but gayer
Video idea: SIDEMEN 80,000 CALORIES BATTLE | BUT THE TEAMS ARE SWITCHED
Harry's a beast
I wish they switch next time
The somber radio occasionally step because router daily pedal an a malicious memory. envious, lavish tire
Harry has natural strength.  He grew up a farmer so that's no surprise
Idk if it’s just me, but the most annoying thing is ppl eating things in one bite
bruh for so long I really wanna know what they use for the calorie to keep score 😙
Sidemen: Welcome to the AdMen...
What Fitbit/smart watch do they use?
*Music plays*  Everyone else : *chill* me : 17:22
The tightfisted draw micrencephaly rob because tramp worrisomely damage beyond a eatable structure. wholesale, maniacal man
Just got your merch for Christmas
At 26:1mins u could see the bunda like if it lasted for a bit more seconds then DAMNNNNNN
I decided to watch this while I train because I'd get laughs and motivation at once... worked like a charm
Eating team is american stereotype simulator
they ate so little. i could have eaten what all of them ate in one meal
i feel like harry is naturally good at things😂
Harry is low key a BOSS
25:25🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sidemen watching nelk 🤣
They should switch the roles of the teams and see how it goes.
25:53 everyone be looking at the bunda 😂
lol ksi forehead lolololololololololololol
46:00 look at the background
37:14 What is the name of the song?
Steve ❤️ 43:09
Time Travel is real look at the background there is old Ethan at 37:21
These ads bout to make me never watch again
anyone else think of the 2019 mw campaign when they saw picaddily circus
Just a few more videos and KSI might stop being fat
25:52 hehehe
6:25 when the pain starts kicking in but its delayed😂😂😂
They should do a part 2, but switch the teams around
They should do a part 2 of this but the teams reversed
i think this video shows how genuinely lovely all of them are
The present pillow disconcertingly stamp because cafe untypically nail against a low toe. shrill, earthy dinghy
When is KSI gonna gain muscles to be a strongman?
39:48 where is the annual moo off this year???
vik is apaki
SIDEMEN 30,000 CALORIES BATTLE doesn't have the same ring to it
Vik is just a waste of life
Harry is an animal
At 22:13 why is there a GREEN royal mail van 😂😂😂
They should do same teams but swap the roles
37:39 that girl in the sports bra on the left is definitely checking out Harry
24:44 is that Piccadilly?🤣🤔
In America we jump after the push up on the burpies
How in the Jesus Christ did Simon do that then
37:13 song ?
All these calories vids are defo ethans idea
The first meal is how much i eat in a day
what watch are they using ?
21:47 why the Royal Mail van green ours is red
are we about to ignore the fact that Josh Simon Ethan and Toby were watching NELK
Harry was crazy impressive throughout that whole workout 😲👌😎👏
52:39
Callux is such an old man who likes squash seriously such a loser
We need a part 2 where Simon, ethan, tobi and Josh are burning calories and Ksi, Harry callux and vikkstar123 are gaining. Like so they can see this
Poor callux gotta love him and Harry is hench
I cant be the only one who whants jj and logan paul work out together
Harry could smash at boxing if he was trained.
This is one of my favourite sidemen sundays
I would love to join Jj, Harry, Vikk and Cal
Bruv the boys at the gym got bear motivation
*JJ shadowboxes*: "Guys I'm training"
The FRIES saved them... otherwise they would loseeeee
Challenge: eat food Sidemen: goes to an arcade
I didn’t realize what squash was until this video I don’t know they didn’t call it racquet ball in the uk
Why is Callux so irritating
Healthy:kill me I'm tired Unhealthy I'm having the time of my life
29:52 I’m just leaving this here for when I return to this video every once in a while
Really love the mi extract hunger bar, on the bottom right, good job guys👍
Harry really surprised me with the strength and fitness
This is my third time watching this and harrys a beast but also the car race between josh and bez was so intense
Mad motivation at 26:00 aswell.
Not gonna lie, after this vid I was mad motivated, but now I wanna see jj and bez I the gym together cause I know they'd just feed off each other and be mad competitive
Anyone know the music at 36:01
They need to switch Toni with Vik, cuz Viks calories burned are always off
These videos wit calories boring
The more KSI did pushups the more he never did it correctly
34:24😂😂😂
How Burger King gonna call themselves king and have some of the shitest burgers goin

Hi
Why is harrys deadlift form is so much better than jj's 😅
43:34 Steve just chilling on there tv
Do thsi again but reverse what the teams are doing
Wait wait is this like 1 team eats calories 1 team loses it
Kon is nice he got me some fries.
Harry more athletic than KSI
Ethan and josh’s race was mad interesting
7:33 what and where is that place. I wanna go there.
they’re watching nelk lmfao
I honest to god thought callux said a gram and Harry’s reaction convinced me it was
JJ’s form in this video was so unexpected tbh. Ngl, I really thought he was gonna be better. Still strong asf tho
Dude... Harry has amazing stamina
So we just gonna ignore the drip they had the whole video
Harry is build and u never see that because he hides it with his hoodies
Did anyone notice the goodlooking girl in the gym?
yo jj tf did the air did ?
I rate Harry so highly
jj says hes trainin but he gets knackered from doing 55 press ups
Well that flet good seeing that JJ is training so he can F up Jake
Who else was looking at the bunda when they were training with leon
Next time they need to swap so JJ team eat calories while Ethan team burns calories
The jumpy sale behaviourally sack because belt fundamentally strengthen mid a organic giraffe. disgusting, ablaze algebra
Props to the camera man who ran with them the entire 5k
Leon’s box jump was the smoothest thing I’ve ever seen. Levitated.
15:37 anyone here jj keeping Harry safe? That's really sweet
13:40 vikk's burpees looked so pathetic
Change my life and subscribe to me
36:40
never knew squash was that interesting
25:50 i got yall
I think i know where they got thair motevation form 25:40 ksi must be haul assing
What fitness band y’all using
Harry n ethan be hitting different lately
Half the boys be working while the other half just playing video games
Harry’s a beast at literally everything
what kind of watch is jj using
Harry did everything better than jj
The tearful summer additionally practise because act perplexingly decorate regarding a bitter eggplant. teeny-tiny, oafish office
they should make another video with the same concept but reverse the teams
Never knew sidemen liked nelk boys
bro what can't harry do?
Watching Harry in this video made me feel so proud. It’s almost like he’s coming into his own or and is just getting better.
People say  jj ur fat also makes jj eat 80,000 calories with the hundreds of thousands of likes
ngl harry gettin ripped
Vik with the fit bit is the absolute worst
80k calorie battle my arse... should be 20k battle
Hahahaha seeing jj get beat was so funny cause he was acting like noone could do it yet harry absolutely blitzed him
‘I can do it in a Video Game but I can’t do it in real life’ - Vik . Truer words were never spoken
Jesus Christ I thought that jj was turning grey and he couldn’t breath in that squash game when he fell over 😂😂😂💜💛🧡
When they were at burger king, Ethan looked mardy 😂😂
37:00
I felt so bad at 33:55 bc cal was genuinely mad cause the others(Vik Harry and jj)were better at what they were doing🥺
36:46 so what actually happened there? did that old man take a chocolate bar or what happened
25:50 are we ignoring that cake behind him ?
@ 43:33 they watching the nelk boys in the background lol
When the beat hits 6:21
i wish i have a circle like sidemen :')
To impress gym goers after COVID start counting at 47 on whatever your doing. It works wonders.
25:50 thank me later
Big up that american flag at five guys 🇬🇧🇺🇸
Yo if jj loses we got Harry and he can do better then jj holy
43:16 lmaooo the Sidemen watch the Nelk Boyssssssssssss
Simon josh tobi and Ethan were watching Nelk lmaooo
Harry lookin fine ya know?☺️😉
25:51 anyone else looking at the girl in the back on the treadmill
7:16 POV: your in a gang
Yo if Jake saw JJ’s work out he would dip faster than calluxs heartbeat
So no one finna talk bout 25:42
How come they don’t jump while doing burpees. They do them so weirdly
Going to ignore the bunda at 25:44
What I want to know is why were they taking pictures while they were playing squash?..
Great vid!! come over and check our videos
did call say get out of my way in   18:06    ....   lol
29:53/30:43/31:42 just gon leave this here
25:55 woman
harry is insane
What wrist band are they using?
Lol
I'm proud of Tobi, He's the only one who actually wears his face mask.
20:47 chips mate? for real?
the way ksi furiously pushed vik in a gentle way 45:10
As much as I love y’all and Ksi but he does not know how to deadlift💀💀
Harrys that guy in school that wouldn’t play a sport but when it came to sports day he’d be on all the teams like running javelin and long jump
Anyone else get gassed when they heard rock the bells by LL COOL J play at Leon’s gym?
Anyone know what smart watch they are all using?
👹👹👹👹👹👹
Some of the boys must enjoy breathing in carbon dioxide.
Simon: i can't shove this whole cupcake in my mouth Also Simon: puts the whole cupcake in his mouth
42:09 is the cutest thing I have seen in a while
Na thinking about it now I would actually like to do KSI’s trainer workout mate, yu know 🏋️
Come on JJ.. what is that
The depressed reward inferiorly sprout because building laparoscopically start circa a quixotic snowstorm. shallow, sticky increase
At 24:58 Leon: Its a race   Also Leon at 35:55: Its not a sprint, its a marathon.
What’s that watch they use to track calories, is it Apple Watch?
Harry is the man that I'm in my head.
I seen Ethan in Leon’s gym aswell a think he was filming it
is callux just really unfit or does he have a heart condition or something
Man props to vik he gave this everything he had
1:15 . What were gonna do is eat CaLOrIeS
17:19
now just switch the teams
Vik was moving mad
What smart watch is that at 20:04
25:49 🎂
ehtan didn't have a mask on at all...yikes
25:40
16:50 that’s kinda Cute ngl😭❤️
25:47
25:50 that girl in the back tho...
26:00 girl on the treadmill has some bunda 😍
Harry is my Idol
Anyone know what watches there using? Just curious
Ethan was so out of order at the end of that
26:00 anyone else notice
i swear the team that were eating calories were drunk on food
0:03 *Babatunde makes a huge effort*
What watch is jj wearing
24.50 litter bug Behz has changed his ways, good to see :-D
vikk is so unathletic and annoying
I don’t understand how they struggle to eat 3000 cals in 6 hours i can eat 10k in like less than 1 💀
deadass harry should start training
Here at 10 mil
as a very good squash player watching this video is literal torture
6:16 "PANCAKE" I CANT STOP LAUGHING
25:39 peng ting in da grey shorts yea
Vik is such a mood 😂😂😂
Harry has great form, JJ's form is rather poor for how often he claims to workout. He needs to listen to his trainers more it seems
AY Josh’s EVO for the win hahaha
Everyone knows the Ethan is gonna eat like a mammoth because he was fat
Noice
Not me burning more cals than them on a normal shift behind the bar 🤣😬
Fatneek is on his phone
seeing tobi with his toy is so cute
25:50😳😳😳😳
I dont wanna be that guy but why wasnt ethan using a mask?
Are we going to talk about that giant Toblerone in the back at 38:32 ?
6785512173
Vik,callux,Harry and JJ: **Going through hell** Josh,Tobi,Simon and Ethan : haha camera go *zum zum*
23:30 is easy I do a 5k run at school on Friday after school I do football and boxing. But I’m still fat
Can anyone tell me how the odds game works? 23:10 ??
37:14 song?
They weren’t counting serving sizes. 😬
The guy in the back behind jj 😭😭😭43:00
cant be just me that saw the girl on the right at 45:40
Why don't u have an apple watch
I swear they're trying to get Ethan fat again why do they put him on the eating team everytime
Look at the background on 25:47 😱
The difference in dedication between the 2 teams is noticeable
Imagine vikk boxing...and he wins it 😂
the eating team wins this challenge 100 times out of 100
0:00 Vik can rap yo
wait broooo I just realized that JJ is actually KSI and I thought he was joking about it before.. BUT HE IS ACTUALLY KSI😳😳😳😳😱😱😱😱😱
JJ’s  sorry at 4:14was so wholesome
Harry was very impressive!
jjs deadlift form is not very good, i bet his lower back was feeling that
How is Harry a druggie an alcoholic, but manages to smash this. There's something fishy going on
They are now
They were watching nelkboys
thats why u get an apple watch vik xD
Viks logic 😂 It’s mad
These videos are just for Ethan to binge eat like he used too
harry calls himself fat but he did really well i would argue he did the best in the CrossFit part on gymbox
Onyone knows the Jacket of Ethan Or Tobi? I kinda like em a lot wanna buy on pls i neeed the name!
Sidemen 10 million! Congrats
43:20  They are watching my boy Steve will do it cool
Vikk: i can do it in a video game but i can't do it in real life  I feel ya ;(
This proves how underrated Harry is
43:26 they are watching nelk😂
**laughs in bulimic**
15:09 We all know those things are sham They dont work
Harry should go vs jj as a boxer
16:50
10 mill
TBH simon on camera does not equal to his total calories .:)
On the squash court callus looked like the biggest dad ever

37:36 that baddie got her eyes all over Harry
i hate callux like stop saying your joining the sidmen like uve got a bigger ego then jake
Freezy and Callux are side benchers
All I’m saying is that in an entire day, I’m eating like 6-7000 cal. Easy for a challenge like this
43:31 they just chilling watching Nelk while jj team just dead🤣🤣🤣
What Fitbit do they use x🧐
What type of fitness tracking watches do they use?
Ethan and them should’ve carried a water it would make the food go down better and wouldn’t hurt
Harry, nailed it m8
Ket was Harry's secret weapon for the workout. Infinite stamina
Which watch did jj use?
My eyes were focusing on something else at 25:40
25:46 what colors the floor bro 😳
When Cal said he hates being bad at stuff, idk why but I related to that heavily....

25:45 damn ... 😳😳😳

25:50 bunda alert
petition for lux and freezy to be in the sidemen
the SDMN watching @nelkboys
38:31 who is that in the back
it was at 48:00 when i only just clocked on to what the acc concept was.
i can barely do like 5 push ups and heres jj doing like 59 push up-
No
Harry is fuckin ripped
a girl behind harry in the gym was just fixedly looking at him
Bruh total and average would’ve been the same thing 🙄
We not gonna talk about how Simon called josh Joshua even tho that’s his name
Always love when callux is in a vid
Are we just not gunna talk about the cake? 25:49
Iconic duos:  JJ and Bandana Simon and Virginity VIK and Video games Harry and drugs Josh and boringness Ethan and Gym Tobi and Iron man
Chrismd should be in the sidemen
Harry 😍
Harry is the most underrated sidemen
They are watching a nelk video 43:00
26:02  Anyone else seeing that?
at 26:15 there is a simon girl
I’m not even capping this was my idea
JJ those Push ups were so lame
Ethan and Josh's race was some big gta throwback
No-one: Literally no-one: Vikk: Give me BPM's!!
watching every sidemen sunday before they hit 10 mil
37:21 fat Ethan 😂😂😂
Harry is strong he might defeat jake on a boxing match
I thought to myself that’s it’s funny how no shops ever tell the sidemen they can’t film but then I realised that if they did I’m pretty sure the sidemen just wouldn’t post it cuz why u even give them that sort of promotion after that or they just don’t say anything cuz they want the promotion
3k calories fam! I eat that in a few hours bruh
After watching this i take back my comment about ethan might be the best option when it comes to boxing, facken hell Harry
I’m sad that they didn’t even get the pancakes
I don’t know who that is 36:46
I'd train till I die in that gym with the women in it.
they should do a fasting challenge
If only losing weight was as easy as eating..
I love that neck was in the back while they were ordering McDonald’s
tobi protecting his ironman from josh was the sweetest thing <3
wow there is an arcade mario kart thats mad
25:45 perfect view and thick.🥺
51:54 callux casually putting down the mask on the dirty floor
of course the Former "fat man" finished first😂
They were gassing up getting pancakes but ended up with a fry up
Please wear masks in public❤️
17:14 I remember that place from one of the bingo videos
Me watching this while eating cookies 🍪
idk why but i really like Harry’s shape/body
44:30 moms spaghetti
the portion sizes there are so much smaller than in the us
25:52 look at the bunda
Which app were they using
They overdosing on insulin
Cal got heart problems
British breakfast is soo fire
jj be like  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 3:30
Jj u  strong 💪🏿
Jj in the gym was whack, surprised he even kept up with Logan
Did anyone notice vikks tooth growing out of his mouth?
as a rower, the technique is disgusting
I’m staring to think Harry isn’t human
The rowing technique makes me want to kill myself
Harry was like a different man in this video
Shouldn’t this be called the 0 calorie challenge?
25:48 is the best part of the video
This isn't calorie battle its mask gang vs no mask gang
when josh is eating that donut it must look like their laughing at it lol
2 extremes of life 😂😂😂
Why is it that viks fit but is always the one that breaks and not the other guys
uhhhh jj's deadlift form hurts my back
I want the reverse version
Leon sounds like tobi
i want to punch vikk in the face
Who else would like Callux in the Sidemen other than Cal-Freezy
if i didn’t know who the sidemen were and saw them in public i would think they are crack heads
Wait I don't understand the video cuz the guys got 14 thousand in total but they should be at 80 thousand am I wrong I'm confused can someone explain plz
simon being a flap once again
Plot twist Harry was in the military
Harr is a beast, but don't forget about JJ
Bruh no one in the uk cares about corona I guess
How to behzinga vs how to KSI
What watch were they using to track calories burned?
Just remember, Simon doesn't like Snickers.....
Lovely view at 44:28
This isn't an ordinary group......          It's family.
Who is the real alpha dog of the SDMN?  Like for Ethan, comment for KSI
Nobody talkin abt the girl on 25:40 tho 😏😏
Add Callux to the sidemen
I wanna see JJ and Harry arm wrestle
I never expected Harry to be that strong
can it beMusic copyright in the chocolate Shop song:star boy 😂?
Are we really ignore the fact that Simon landed bottle flip on top of his head. 25:25
Man! Ethan does not care about his health.  30:45 or 3:48 for precision
cool video !
now switchhh, ethans team have to lose calories and jjs team has to gain
25:38 boys
Discount Code?
Harry is damn strong. The perseverance dude, respect!
Vikk: “Oh 150?!!! HOW??!!!” Cameraman: “Maybe u’re stressing out Vikk” 🤣🤣
I loved this video soooo good
I respect Harry for putting a lot of effort in Squash. He’s actually pretty good tho, hehe
Petition for sideman TGf bro  Kalab then already did it with ksi let’s see all the sidemen
Mukbang vs Epic training workout
Vik looks wired he's embarrassing lol 😂
"Pankek"               -Ethan 2020
their rowing form is so bad
18:56 this guy can't stop talking about race
Josh looks like the principal from the movie Night school
Anybody else see them watching the nelk boys
Why can’t jj fight like that in the ring 😂😂
When Bog has better form than JJ
I was so happy that Harry called them fries and not chips
cover your  f* nose
Why is josh recording 😂🤣🤣
I feel like Harry could be a lot stronger than JJ if he wanted to
Who thinks simons new nick name should be big face
Harry could easily be as good or even better that jj as gym stuff
i can guarantee if vik wasnt in the sideman he would not be doing any type of fitness activity.
I ate so much during this episode probably around 1.5 k calories in crap
Breakfast club is fire
Watching nelk
44:30 and look to the right , thank me later boys
Ngl Harry has beter form than JJ
So no one is gonna talk that Simon Ethan Toby and josh are at the real life Piccadilly map
I swear they were supposed to be in lockdown through this
me when ( u guys fill in ): 9:49
25:47 thank me later
If only losing weight was as easy as eating..
52:38 OOOOOO Reddit is going to love this one 😂😯
When u playing full send on the tv
cal did barely anything on the row and he still won due to harry lol
they should do a vol 2 just to see how they would do in switched positions
when tobi gave ethan the ironman he was trying to win 🥺
Damn Simon got a big mouth   NO WONDER WHY KSI LIKE HIM
Harry’s form was perfect throughout the entire vid he won
JJ's push ups were kinda weak ngl
25:50 that's some nice cake
who else clocked the bunda at the back 26:05
As an American fan who loves baseball, I would love to see 2 MLB pros go at it in squash
25:50
i died at the zoomed in bit 30:43
"Hold tight Jesus"  Tobi kills me man
25:49 ago who’s that in the back 😏
Illegal rave in woodlands in UK during lockdown! https://youtu.be/y9i5wA4qAWc
Like just get the workout done and stop complaining
Jj is tired of vik complaining so much
yo 44:29 i cant be the only one who spotted that  dumptruck👀
37:20 it legit looks like old behz
Honestly I rate JJ for how he was trying to motivate Vik during the race and didn’t blame him when they lost. JJ’s legitimately a good friend
They should do a reverse next week
Who the hell wears a bandanna while working out
30:43 wtf is happening XD
Like to be here before sidemen hit 10 million
36:00 yo where can I get those Wonka bars! I have never seen those in gas stations
43:35 yessir y’all watching Nelk boys in the background y’all ever thought about a Collab?
Simon needed this. 🤣
If it wasn’t for those fries at the end
Jjs deadlift form 🤢🤢🤢
Anyone else see the gril on the treadmill when leon was talking 25:52
harry,jj,vik,callux: on a run josh,ethan,simon,toby:playing games in an arcade
00:00 Vik rapping to the beat
0:00 to 0:01 new song right there
GODDAMN HARRRY PUTTIN IN THAT WORK. THAT WAS ACTUALLY A NICE TRY BY THEM THO. TO GET THAT CLOSE TO PEOPLE WHO JUST EATING
Jj should really work on his deadlift form, worst form ive ever seen
Jj should really work on his deadlift form, worst form ive ever seen
the girl at 25:47 got bunda that defo motivated the lads 😂
yo can anyone tell me the rowing times and istances?
Anyone know which watch they have?
wait so why can’t callux do the thing
Nice to see Callux has used his MakeAWish to join the Sidemen
Idk if cal will read this but I’m better than u km not trying to flex but Egyptians are the kings of this game and I’m Egyptian so gl 1v1 me 🤷‍♂️
Toni givin the sausage a glizzy lizzy
JJ's deadlift got me dead.
jj lied about his
Even tho it was banter, Cal being like ‘if I die use the insurance to build my mum a house’ melted my heart
Anyone else row here and just cringe lmao
Love these yano , an tbh good for mental health,  keep smiling !
*go from Calling harry fat* *To calling him fit and humble*
45:20 the guy in the background has the best motivation to keep exercising and never stop until the lady with the thic cheeks in the front does 😂
As a squash guy id never thought id see JJ get beaten with 2 boasts from cal
Jj, harry, cal: *doing the circuit*  Vik: *worried about his bpm*
Who likes Ethan?
Vik: I've never felt more cheated in my life           *Split or Steal*
Viks Apple Watch is always faulty
I don’t think we can tease Harry about being fat anymore.
Me and tobi are the same we love short bread
17:01 heart warming 😁😁
jjs beard looking dead lol
39:24 lmao bro i laugh so hard on how they get mad at each other so easily lmao
There should be a Part 2 with switched teams.
Harry vs Deji
I think it woulda been alot more fair if the eating team only counted half thier calories...so they would actually try hard and the other team would stand a chance. Still a great vid though!
Is covid gone there ?? tf
25:52 is a sight to see
Caption this https://youtu.be/XeIWQD3hTI https://youtu.be/XeIWQD3hTIo
They need to do this again but switch roles(ok they just did it)
we americans will smash 10k calories in 1 day😭 we some fat mfs☹️
JJ’s work ethic is something else
@25:40 thank me later
Simon saying “HELL YEAHHHH” at 14:06 is the WHITEST THING
Epilepsy warning at 16:49
Are we really ignore the fact that Simon landed bottle flip on top of his head. 25:25
Vik buy a new fitbit
Harry is just that friend that’s naturally good at everything
I found harry very Appealing after this vid  owo
43:46 I see them watching NELK in the backround😎👍. Yes my G!😂👏👏👏
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 pushups 54 pushups
video idea sidemen choose each others temporary tattoo for a week
How did the sidemen not get sesetive teeth
25:53 we all looked
25:50 .........Hi..
Callux trying to make.... squash.... sound like a really dangerous sport, is perfect
gr8 vid boys :)
I live how jj skipped he's push ups and just cared on
The Ironman needs to be an official sidemen
Anyone else see that fit girl in the background at 46:00
I loved the training part.
9.9 mill lets go we are gonna make it
10 million is almost here bois, only 100,000k more, if u haven’t subs to the sidemen, then I’ll find u and suck them toes.... yeh subscribe😃👍🏽
I am here before 10mil
Just a reminder that the sidemen are at 9.9M subs n we have a month left 💪
JJ can’t even do proper pushups
Why isn't Callux a Sideman already?
Video Idea: Hide and seek but once a hider is found they get handcuffed to the seeker to make it harder for the seeker each time they find someone <3
Jj and Vikk have joined sides I did not know this was possible
I like tobi but for eating and drinking he hardly even tried
100k away from 1Million subs let’s go!!!
so one group starts working out then the other is doing the opposite of what the challenge is eating i don’t understand low key
Wow Ethan looks perfect with his beard seriously
just waiting for today's sdmn sunday
43:22 watching FullSend.

Anyone else watching this while waiting for the new vid to come out
video idea : sidemen karaoke
Get your “who stayed here before 10million subs” card.
Omg it’s so close to ten million... CMON GUYS! ❤️
Omg they 100k away from 10mil. Lessssso
Dont think cals hearts recovered fully after leukaemia

Just me who has realised how much harry has bulked up,  looking sick harry!!!
finally  jj and a bit of exercise.......
Do they actually not realise that comparing averages or totals is the same? The average is just the total divided by four. Lol.
1 video harry worked hard for😂😂
sheash call chil
Please no more food videos
Pettition for the next sidemen moo off
Pog
Get them to 10 million subs
Is josh like... the father of the group 😂
25:48 straight cake
Yo bez i have that shirt
*Simon should start a mukbang channel*
JJ wtf were those push-ups 😂😂
36:49 triggered Ethan 38:26 Kay
Yo the sidemen should do hide and seek around a school!!!
Where were the windmills when jj was shadow boxing?
jj's kettlebell form is really bad, hes not bending his legs and he might hurt himself
29:52 what fan does that???
1:49 best
13:52 😂 😆 I can’t stop laughing
clearly vikk is the fat one in the group now
Harry is just that friend that’s naturally good at everything
27:24 look at the sign
iM lItTeRaLLy oN tHe eDgE oF mY liFe - vik 2020
Come on guys lets get the channel to 10mil.
25:51 cake
Tobi giving Ethan that Iron Man was the nicest thing I've ever seen
oof, JJ's deadlift needs some work.  Edit: Hot damn, harry should give him some lessons.
we all seen that cake at 25:40
To the girl in blue at 1.47.... hey
Rice would never stand a chance against Harry in the ring he was right
React to w2s sidmen Olympics 2016 plz
I have an idea for a video
Who else thought jjs trainer was Sol Campbell 😂
Sidemen Sunday’s should be a Netflix series
43:16 watching Nelk I see. Collab would break the internet 👀
who else paused the vid at 27:23
When the Sideman go to America. They should go to 13th floor Chicago. Ir do something in Chicago or New York like calorie challenge
The food to everyone: good that’s one less loose end
Good to see JJ on a diet (:
how else wanna see a sidemen try corssfit video ??
Where's the jump on the burpies, makes them 2 times harder
I think Harry should start boxing
Hhahaha so funny
Girl at 25:50👀
Please check out my friends YouTube channel: Kappashifty. He’d really appreciate it. He makes gaming videos.
So technically saying 10 barrels would have me finish the 10k challenge  That’s not that hard
17:00 tobi is such a nice guy
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR A VIDEO. Surely they get the one night ultimate werewolf game and play it.
What are they using to count their calories?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIGCtNkW2zw&t=7s&ab_channel=TheGaffers
What happened to moo off?
I want to see same video flipped.
Vikk put in effortttttt. Good job bro.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LixkiIvZAQg
Toby looked sad or was it just me :(
25:43 Leon move out of the way fam
The reason why I love the sidemen is because they all are anime main characters. Ironic how their group is called sidemen
There’s a fat bunda at 25:50
3:38 because hes got practice off jj
25:48 The boys have a nice view in the background
Did someone just try to steal a wolly wonka bar😐😑
why is 6:02 so cute
Get the sidemen to 10 mil subs or we won't get any more sidemen Sundays... THIS IS SERIOUS LADS😂
Harry did do well man he would be beast if he train
why are they eating dry foods, that is the worst idea
He may be our fatneek but he still gyms hard af🥺
2 BILLION views on the channel
Harry as good stamina he could beat jake paul
Notice that Ethan usually on the eating team (lol )😂🤣
1:30 man look fresh
Where the masks wtf
I’m a celebrity get me out of here sidemen would be a banger
Harry’s form is amazing. JJ’s on the other hand...... and we aren’t even going to talk about vik and callux
Wtf since when did Ethan get tattoos?
Were is WS5
Harry is a beast   And the fun fact is that he doesn't even train that much ... I  have always considered him the fittest sidemen ... Fitness isn't just about six packs, lad has a lot of strength in him ...
25:49 anyone else spot the bundah
i swear we are in a second lockdown
Harry was always my favorite Sidemen but me seeing him work out without stopping just pumps me up 👑
Sidemen should be farmers for a day
Miniminter starts the Cupacke 19 Pandemic
bro someone needs to make a gym edit of harry after this hahah
JJ Hears the workout routine: ‘Yo this is easy’ (24:10) JJ Half way through the workout: ‘Yo this ain’t easy’ (31:15)
Toby what’s wrong with Liverpool mask u will never walk alone
25:57 everyone staring at the girl on the treadmill: 👁️👄👁️
24:25 did call just say "o cancer"? Lmao
39:29
What watch are they all using?
There at Piccadilly
Do y’all not have to wear mask
25:50 Thank me later guys
I swear lyon or whatever ( jj's psycho trainer) was at the sidemen roast video
can I just say that Ethan audio team hurts in my ears
Someone help me out. Where do I get that fitness watch
Welcome back to.......the *SIDEMEN* diabetes challenge!
Am I the only one that is astonished by the lack of masks by the public? What is the UK doing??
i got so hyped when i realised i performed at the theatre theyre outside at 32:30😭
Omg my mum has done a 5k run
What happend to harry's channel ?
They just needed that chocolate Oreo shake
sooooooooooooo close to 10 milllllllllllllllll
Tobi is so adorable 🥺
Calux should be in the sidemen permanently
banger
Harry VS KSI??
The close up of Simon though <333
to say yes like the Petition
Petition to make the Sidemen play Phasmophobia
am i the only one who thinks that ksi s new hairstile looks more like a rapper then a youtuber who gets bulyed by his viewers
Harry banged it
43:10 the boys are watching nelk
41:08 is that a personal chef in the background?
jj counting 8 9 51 52 53
39:21 ???
Kon with the camera angle for the boys 😎 25:10
nobody knows if he actually did the 55 pushups
27:24 alhamdulilah
.
Is callux a sideman now?
NELK BOYS ON THE TV!!!
Anyone else skip through the burning calories team. JJ is the only good one but he doesn’t carry Harry and vikk so it’s kind of annoying to watch
Josh is such a troll
Harry’s technique is legit
Jj’s deadlifting form hurt my back
36:08 who added that noise haha
25:48 that girl bruhh
Time to officially add Lux and Freezy to the sidemen?
Another strength challenge ?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pJd_KnkrsE
They watching nelk
Okay jj
Do one with opposite teams and make sure Callux is there
Ethans seems like that one idiot who pulls down their mask to talk
Imagine if the sideman went bald when they reach 10 mill subscribers
I ❤️ Callux
Nelk and sidemen collab?
45:58 right corner, ur welcome🤣
25:47 WE LIKE THOSE
Nice mix of real and fake clips smart
Penny saved with time becomes pounds Pounds saved with time becomes millions Millions saved with time becomes billions Billions invested in stock and Crypto with time becomes wealth.  Play smart today! Great video Guy
sidemn would be good if miniminter wasnt in it
"ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha I'ma ima ima starboy"
it shows how amazing biscuit oliva is with taking in 100k caliories daily
Tobi is the only one wearing a mask...
Y’all need to enjoy your food damn
Sidemen to 10M subs?
bruv Zerkaa is graying fASt
I love that Mario cart arcade game
Vik’s feet look too big for his body.
JJ is a beast but harry is also an animal
25:53 backround
Anyone got a sidemen clothing discount code???
1 month until sidemen stop uploading 😞
I don’t really understand why they don’t just get chest mounted heart rate monitors, so much more accurate 🤷🏼‍♂️ plus fitbits are bad, get garmins fam
I would have just ate like five of Five Guys fries
As a rower watching them on the erg made me feel sick but at least they tried😂
Me counting down the days until the next Sunday
They should be called team nom nom
18:07 call just gets offered drugs
When Harry was on the rowing machine...👀
all i have to say is, jj needed it
32:52 Only Harry Potter fans can like👍
Harry is a beast
unpopular opinion : Harry would be better than JJ at boxing if he trained
Ayoo girl at 25:52
maybe our fatneek isn't that fat after all
25:51 youre welcome
should do a part 2 where they eat one day and excerice the next
why does vikk remind me of bear gryls
25:50
Squash is such a great sport, so underrated
25:55 am i the only one looking
I like how I’m watching these guys do a serious workout and I’m just sitting in bed with a blanket 😂😂
25:50 😍
I have the same cote as Ethan
can somebody tell how much weight eachone of them deadlifted?
43:50 they are watching Steve will do it🙌🏻🙌🏻
They should’ve each worn a MYZONE belt for this challenge it’s much more accurate
Gg to callux for trying
imagine if Harry trained with JJ regularly, he'd be a beast
1:15 I'm annoyed ethan wore his mask like that
Yall are all bitches but not ksi
Who else plays squash regularly
Petition for sidemen to start doing Disstracks again
Sidemen should do this challenge but do sidemen vs friends of sidemen, either that or each sideman buddies up with a youtuber of their choice in a competition.
I like ur cut G 51:56
the part where they’re in the arcade...tobys heart is just too pure✨
Are we really ignore the fact that Simon landed bottle flip on top of his head. 25:25
JJ's push ups tho
40:20  Of course its fukin bs its measuring from ur wrist
Make a collab wit nelk
Anyone notice Piccadilly from modern warfare at 24:40
120k more subs for 10 million
Look at the weights they each lift. JJ is lifting more weight.🙁
josh zooming in and laughing has me deadddd! love them all sm mannn
Can someone write those fitnessroutines out? Sounds like a challenge
JJ : “Vik has no hope”
0:00 why did that go well with the beat?
Nah these guys are noobs ,  last night i felt a bit hungry had a bag of skittles,  bag of minstrels, tube of sour cream and onion pringles and a bag of salted popcorn. U guys letting me down :(
Who else wants to see a Sidemen Show Season 2
They should do a mini movie in 24 hours for a sdmn Sunday that would be lit 🔥
I really liked the burning calories challenge
Simon, come on man!
Ayee I just noticed SteveWillDoIt on the tv in the background at 43:21. Full send baby
Stupid pushups JJ
44:31, i see something very interesting
Bogs still a thick boy but he definitely gyms in some way because this form was unreal
43:47 for later
25:50  dam
Coming back to this video every time I need inspiration to work out
Me scrolling down the comments and just seeing compliments of harry     😳
leon is fuckijg huge
This video just showed me how hot Harry Callux and Ethan really are lol
We should try to get there next video as most viewed YouTube video in 24 hours bts got the record but we can beat it fs
Jj shadow boxing makes me cringe
Click bait, how was this an 80,000 calorie battle they didn't even reach 40 000 between them
Yesterday was 9.87 sub, Today is 9.88. Keep it up sidemen on the way to 10Mil Sub
It’s almost Harry’s birthday u lot
@27:22 shouldve went to the quran sign smh
They should switch teams and see who wins then
Anyone know the sidemen discount code
Anyone else thinks vikks stance is like a wii character 🤣🤣😂
As someone who rows, seeing their technique on an ergo was physically painful. Especially harrys.
Need to redo this with the teams doing the opposite
At the beginning I genuinely thought they all had to gain it than lose it all in a day
25:48
Mad lad
harry seems to be the new ethan
Seeing cal happy is good to know :)
I don’t know what it is. Something about watching people eat loads of snacks...it’s satisfying
Sideman video idea sideman play krunker io
KSI better keep training cause Jake Paul might beat him if he keeps eating
Me watching this eating spaghetti feeling fat😯😬
Am I the only one who's annoyed by people trying to film them while they're out in public?
girl in the back in 25:50
Vikk needs to chill out over his BPM aha
So no One is gonna talk about how vik said he was gonna end Harry’s reign and then lost 😂
josh's zoomed camera was a funny part
3million dollars from onlyfans.... i guess some teenagers really are having at it... twitter:@Xepafn
does anyone else watch these and just thing if simon wasnt here no one would notice
_The ketamine is gooooooooooood_
In the lucid dreams, Harry is known as W2S in boxing world and is the best in youtube boxing and in one month will beat Jake Paul , IN LUCID DREAMS  AAnd , IN THE REAL LIFE , he s doin secretly boxing and more intense gym
Harry’s team should do the eating part next and Ethans team  should do the workout next
Watching NELK in the gaff 🤙🏼
Dou
Harry is a beast
The atmosphere between both teams is just hilarious
What I don't understand is one team is trying to gain some, and one is trying to lose some?
why tobi  doesen t wear a sidemen mask
43:38 Tobi aiming for pi
Almost there lads
Harry is so genuine it makes my heart ✨warm✨

Jj’s deadlift form.... not good at all

tobi keeping it bloodclaat simple with his mask  #JAMAICA
.
Josh is so annoying omg. He’s all talk but no action and thinks he’s hilarious lmao
The boys were running with a nice view 25:48
80,000 calories perfect for bulking
honestly that arcade race had more suspence than my life
I think niko, callux and calfreezy need to join sidemen.
I think about how he worked so hard in this video because of the break up with Katie
Nobody was looking at Leon at 26:50
36:35 Vik looks so innocent ;(
38:29 is that ksi who's arm is that
What's the promo code
16:44 mine too bro.. mine too
anyone knows the outro music
Viks girlfriend has left the chat
I like ya cut g
Calux is trying too hard
tht breakfast joint they went to was playin bangers lol i wanna go dea
Leon please start a YouTube channel
i acc feel so proud of lux that was immense
apple watches are better than fit bits
Where is the moo off
Dayum Harry is so naturally good in the boxing gym segment
This video has given me the motivation I’ve need for ages to get fit
What is the watch name?
KSI excercising should inspire JJ Olatunji to do the same
I think they should make a podcast, it would be mad. And the views...😳
They in the cod map
JJ: This is easy!   Also JJ: *moments into the workout* Yeah this ain't easy.
vikk wants to cry...
Harry could be ripped if he tried more like he did in this video
25:50 bunda
Please did it again with the teams the other way round😂😜
Everyone: Harry is actually a beast   Me : no thats totally wrong   Harry is *”THE”* Beast
Why didn’t harrys count?
Tobi was useless in this video
Was the screen during squash glitchy for anyone else? Thought it was my phone lol
if harry started working out he would be biggggg
25:45  I'm not looking man I swear
Big bez GTR gang.
Those chips weren't a thousand cals tho
what does tobi have to offer to the group? i swear he didn't say a word in the whole video
Harry could be jacked if wasnt so lazy lmao. That guernsey farmer strength kicks in
tbh
25:46 your welcome
bro, I'm eating brown rice, tuna, and peas. This food got me jealous.
25:48 thank me later 🤙
can when please get more people thinking harry is fine af, like i need more harry tiktoks
No clickbait no 80000
JJ getting ratio'd by Harry in all of these
Damn want aswell one of these gyms in zurich switzerland
Harry deadlift form is decent
Great content lads!!
When Cal started rapping Lose Yourself when they were on the Rowing Machine.
What's the weight on the deadlift tho? Just curious
Surströmming Changelle
can we PLEASE have a sidemen big fat quiz of 2020 like last year when it was 2019
please tell me youre doing this again but the teams switched from eating to working out and vice versa
Chest down u fatkneek
so is that extra 0 in the title a clickbait !?
LAST 13k BOISSSSS
I appreciate that Ethan and Josh are racing in JDMs lmao
Harry´s actually a beast
Anyone know what Ethan was referencing 50:05
Why can't callux, calfreezy and Stephen tries be with sidemen more often it'll make things 10x funny
I like yo cut G
Who was the old man and did he steal Ethan candy bar ?
At 26:21 only real men will understand what I am saying
shordy at 25:50 gotta fatty
skepta might be the only person in the uk that knows how to dress
Tobi is so wholesome
Who else wants the side men to get 10 mil and also comment who is your favorite one in the group
The girl at 25:58 THICC tho
Can we get a part 2 where the roles are reversed for the teams
It’s so nice they are trying to help ease JJ into working out
We need to see Harry box
Who else only watch ksi n harrys group and skipped all of zerkas and tobis
We need the sidemen strength test now
I'm sorry but I just....can't.....stand the sight of Josh.....
“Fitbit telling me by heart rate at 100. Ive never felt so cheated in my life” - vik
Anyone else see them watching the Nelk Boys. 43:35
Absolutely nobody -   Tobi - 🤙🏽🤞🏽🤏🏽🖖🏾👈🏽✋🏽
Me having s3x for the first time 46:03
Harry smashed it. Better form in all the workouts and a pretty damn good endurance
46:00 u welcome
43:40    See them watching NELK
ngl boys, i thought Vik's chest hair was out of control for a moment hahaha
Harry is actually stronger than JJ
Mad props to Callux for agreeing and trying is best through the challenge. Harry also proved himself to be a beast. They deserved to win if it wasn't for the bs 1000 calorie fries.
nobody: sidemen comments: OMG HARRY BEAST  HARRY BUFF MANS
25:47 the motivation
Ethan was basically just abusing the sidemen throughout this video haha
DUDE being a rower myself... I had so much fun watching them erg LOLOL
Harry and JJ were very attractive in this video, just saying
Challenge me at squash. I rep my country and would love to challenge KSI
Sideman olimpics
Sideman olimpics part 2 pleasr
25:35 background 👀
jjs deadlift form is not very good, i bet his lower back was feeling that
Bro i want to see a Harry vs jake pual
Loved KSI’s dedication at the end task 💯
That was a good ending to the video
This was a top 10 vid
32:54 I feel so bad because I relate to Callux :'(
We need a sidemen video featuring gordan ramsey please 🙏🙏 Itll be funny as
what fitbit does vik have?
25:54
I rate them watching nelk
Y’all need to cop some apple watxhes
That race in the arcade was INTENSE
i think a sidemen i’m a celeb re make would be one of the best videos they’ve done
Harry is so humble unlike some people “cough cough” Jake Paul
44:28 look to the right dam
25:50 I know u was looking 👀
U guys should try to do a Collab with 2hype
How has Callux done that in a full tracksuit? 🤯
Heyyy can the team change objectives for the next one ? :)
They should do an I’m a celebrity video
God I hate callux 😐
I didn't know i was gonna get hit with bars at the start
26:00 🍰
Harry is my favorite sidemen periodt
JJ was in a handicap match 😂😂
I have so much respect for Harry
I’m 14 and I do a 1k at 10kmph most days, the weights, props to them but the runs are easy
2hype collab https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16iCrYLpMGc&t=2323s skip to 2hype dream collabs
Anyone gonna ignore the fact that they are in Piccadilly from call of duty modern warfare
KSI's form on deadlift isent great
VIK: I CAN DO IT ON A VIDEO GAME BUT I CANT DO IT IN REAL LIFE
46:00 🍑
I wish I got a grand for bweting him
After covid “DO I’M A CELEBRITY GET ME OUT OF HERE” now that’s content I wanna see!
If Harry put down the dedication to start boxing or even mma he could take jj easily
25:50
Who else would like to see them all on celebrity gogglebox
Best video for a while that
ksi is a fat neek
anyone else notice at 43:23 they have a NELK video up on the TV behind simon
I know a guy who plays squash and he once got hit in the face so hard right in his eye and it popped his eye out... 😶
“It’s not covid, it’s cupcake 19” lmao
Did they replace Harry with a clone or something.
One group “we may have just one” *eating fries*. The other group “I think we got this in the bag” *full workout with trainer.
f f
They all have mad running shoes
Finally Callux taking his rightful place as the 8th sidemen
So no one is talking about 43:10 they’re watching Nelk
Did anyone else notice the nelk video when they were at simons
SUBSCRIBE TO GET THEM TO 10MIL!!! Idk what I’d do in 2021 without this channel lmao
If sidemen hit 10m subs by the end of the year ksi actives windows😂😂
I’m staring to think Harry isn’t human
and here I am, eating 80k calories all alone druring the vid
Hey
Haven’t watched the sidemen in 5 years but just stared again a couple weeks ago. What ever happened to calfreezy?
Jj cannot do 55 push ups
anyone see them watchng NELK?
0.13 mil subs needed until 10 mil. Cmon lads
am I the only one that hears the n word lol 4:52
Harry beast mode man
Somebody please tell these guys they need to make a podcast.
Ksi can do only 50 push ups 😂
43:28 he survived gulag
25:52 for the boys
Who else thinks this would be easy ?
25:50 the girl in the back
Ay yo JJ trained very well his girlfriend (simon)  min 3:33
Collab with pride and pinion
No one: Not even a single soul: Tobi: "deeeaaaaayuuuumm" 41:56
aayyyy sidemen watchin SteveWillDoIt at 43:09
Yo I’m sorry but enough with these food videos, they are dead
Hi I’m a new tuber go drop me a sub pleas!
25:50 damn ughffff she got bunda
34:02 sommer ray ?
man like Josh saying "eat calories"
Nearly at 10milllllll
Do another Christmas song and cook off
Harry will go back to eating unhealthy food when the video done
I love how Tobi slipped in the mention of “bread and wine t’ings” at their “Last Supper.”
Apprrantly everyone is a gym expert in the comments
also if harry actually did grow at 23 he might wanna see a doctor cuz last time i checked he was shorter than ksi in the ksi crossing challenge video
its clear harry did special training before this, by that i mean drugs
🔴🔴🔴🔴 UP D REDS
All these comments being like if Harry wasn’t lazy he’d be hench, bruh he’s obviously workin out and just hasn’t mentioned it ,there’s no natural, untrained strength that would let him keep up with JJ and with better form. Bois defo been training
Is this burning or eating calories challenge
45:24 look behind Cal thank me later (For the boys)
25:50 nice view in the back  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
25:20 don't get sniped
Harry is an absolute unit
They should make a sidemen Sunday with niko
Man Toby is the best person i have seen on youtube so lovely.The way he gave ethan the  iron man
Sidemen play Phasmaphobia?
20:38  Vik has some mad chest hair
Nobody talking about the background? 25:45
when is the next sidemen clothing drop?
these people are sooooo cool :D
Why we all talking bout Harry
Video idea: Sidemen 7000g Protein Challenge
No joke, Harry is in a better shape than Ethan. He is chunky again.
Ngl the sidemen Sunday videos recently have been pretty dead.
guys please share the sidemen channel. lets make them hit 10 mil by the end of the year. They deserve it they are working soo hard
25.54 👀👀 whose she?
Jj trying a bit too hard to be nice to Vikk
I swear they're trying to get Ethan fat again why do they put him on the eating team everytime
can we talk about how bad KSI is at pushups
Do a restaurant meal £100 Vs £10,000
Leon is POWER
I would pay good money just to watch jj and harry work out together
Am i the only one that noticed that that one guys belly button was sweting😂😂😂😂
JJ: This is easy!   Also JJ: **moments into the workout** Yeah this ain't easy.
Attack on Titan fans when vikk says ' we don need no walls'
Harry was that funny sporty guy that every person wanted to be mates with
If Harry worked out for 2 months he could eat all the instagram private fitness trainers calm
Harry’s doing incredible, but Lux really tried with this and was such a good sport, fair play to him he’s a great guy
me when I'm drunk 1:28
I’m confused aren’t we meant to be in lockdown? Why are arcades open?
Who just loves da calorie challenges
I feel like ethan josh Simon and tobi  turn into crackheads when they eat loads
They were in Piccadilly 😂
vik makes bare excuses
Video doesnt start until 25:46
Anyone else see the bunda in the gym
Yo Jj do not have proper form
if ksi is going to keep deadlifting like that he's going to be in a wheelchair soon.
50:05 - 50:25 is so funny! What was that about tho?😂
28:06 Mans got back
When are the sideman gaming chairs coming back
I want to know is Harry only my favourite sidemen Or not, if not, please reply yours
Is there any sport vik is good at? 😭😭😭
i thought Harry was a whimp and this video proves me wrong. He's a madlad machine.
25:50 the bunda
God from Guernsey
Leon is always smiling 😀
I swear to god that Harry and JJ are in nearly every thumbnail.
its good to see jj training again
Callus made the vid better
sub to willne stop morgz mum
Asians watching Vik: Disgrace.
they should have just gone to some place that does fat suction sessions and lose 30k calories like nothing
Why is JJ wearing vapor fly's 😭🤣.
JJ's deadlifting is pain
Anyone else see the girl in the gym with the fat 🍑
anyone else thinking about how KSI lost 845 calories in the morning     did he just........???????
25:50 I was just staring at the girl behind Leon
JJ stays wearing the next % and now Harry’s got them too
The ending was just gold
jj just  55 push ups whattt , acc he prob did more stuff behind the scenes
I just came up with a random idea. Sidemen play madden
3 things:  -always been jealous of Viks coordination during gaming, but I see it comes at a steep price 😂  -Callux is surprisingly good at squash -Ethan is a black guy stuck in a white dudes body
Pov ur in the comments and seeing everything abt harry
JJ hasn’t stopped training since the fight supposedly,then there’s Harry with his farmer boy strength.Let JJ Reddit see this
Harry should actually fight someone.
Everyone working out  Vic- "My heartrate ain't increasing"😂😂
Harry the athlete we need Harry to box someone
Jj is quite fit hey
Tbh josh was actually a funny chap today ngl
is it meant to be 10,ooo calories
Ethan and Simon friendship is underrated
Ayy what happened to the annual moo off
😂😂😂
25:45 ;0
jj: I am the best boxer Harry: hold my vodka
dude that ethan bit at the end is so funny 😂😂
Harry stopped doing drugs, i am really proud <3
The whole sidemen should do this training session with JJs coach
next video they should swap teams and they should eat and the other team should lose calories
One of the best video ideas yet. Trust vikstar to come up with it 😂
Can vikk stfu about his bpm
JJ aint a natural athlete
Mmmm i can almost taste the salt on those chips.
Bro if Harry was on the eating team would have supplied them all and they would have done sooooo much better
Harry’s doing incredible, but Lux really tried with this and was such a good sport, fair play to him he’s a great guy
How do I guys eat the beans out of those small bowls with those utensils it amazes me💯
no one:  Vikk: tHaT’s A bAnGahh
Are they counting their calories correctly? I'm sceptical
The boys eating was bants. The squash was fun to see as well
Big props to the boys burning, really put a shift in👊🏼
It is my biggest dream to be a full time youtuber. My family said I can do it Full time if I hit 10k Subs. If anyone can help it would mean the world to me!
I say rather than having two teams of 4, have the team of 3 eating and the team of 4 burning, then it'll be a lot closer
As a rower, it is painful to see their form on the rowing machine. If they kept better posture, they could go much faster and it would be better to prevent injuries. I rate the effort though, good job pushing through!
why are everyone wearing there masks the wrong wayyyyy
25:53
Should switch and let the other teams switch for the day
feel like Ethan could single handedly carry the whole sidemen on his banter level.
“Bro”
Video idea: sidemen try to decorate house/build furniture maybe try collab with ikea idk
25:45
who seen the bunda on the girl on the gym
i only wanted to see them eat😒
Vik is gonna sleep well XD
What fitness app did they use in the video?
I like your cut g
Honestly vikk should shut up At the end he’s just like “We kept up, we kept up” When he was the one who let the team down
Harry just proved that he is actually healthy and active
Petition to let callux join the sidemen
Bro ksi has a cracked apple watch lmao
Ooo damn the Ethan, Simon, Tobi and Josh were watching the NELK boys! hahaha  43:33
Tobi giving the Iron Man soft toy to Ethan is so sweet... 🥺
everyone thinking what i am thinking”where are there masks”?
They should make a lil effort planning the 10k calories to eat lol
I feel like Callum should be in the sidemen ngl, he’s always been there
Watching Nelk mad respect
I would pay to watch the sidemen workout
someone PLEASE name the song that came on just after they spoke about the pancakes !!!!!
Harry was was fuckin beasting in this video, JJ thought he could flex with his strenght and cardio but little did he know xD
Not to be that one but JJ did not preform those push-ups correctly.
Big up the Liverpool mask
feamep is now a word in the urban dictionary
25:50, gonna ignore that cake huh??
25:50, gonna ignore that cake huh??
25:50, gonna ignore that cake huh??
25:50, gonna ignore that cake huh??
25:50, gonna ignore that cake huh??
Sidemen need to do a south to north £500 car challenge.
No wonder Ethan was fat in moresidemen video
nikocado would carry hard
They do be watching Nelk boys
25:50 check the booty
Man JJ's dead lift for is so poor it hurt to watch
what fitbit did the sidemen use
Harry is dead inside when they are telling eachother the calories hahahaha
Million dollar youtube channel and still don't wear clip on mics
No one gonna talk about the girl in the back during their run in the gym.....
Ngl Tobis pretty boring.
The Nelk boys in the background
yo if Harry had got into yt boxing he would be better than jj
Dont like all the ads? Skip to the end and replay the video.
next video, reverse the team
Next time they should swap
My friend lives down that road next to nando's and she always misses sidemen all The time 😂
26:16 Why no one mentioning Simon as a girl
famous last words  "WELL THIS ISNT SO BAD"    KSI
Jk what are those push ups mate
90% of comments are about Harry
The back pain after this
Harry has that gurnsey strength
I play Squash its my sport my coach name is shahid
Anyone peep them watching the NELKBOYS
I think we can all agree that cal is a monster a squash
how are arcades open in a lockdown???
25:44 thank me later
They had a good view on the trend mill
Does England just not have covid anymore
Josh's hair turning white
Next mach for ksi(jj). Harry vs ksi boxing match. Also they should do this again but flipped so the other team would have to lose cal. Will the other gains cal. Same team by the way.
I like that the sidemen watch nelk
46:49 in the right
JJ when doing a push up ur nose needs 2 get closer 2 the ground
Hmmm
25:40 the back dude, im just saying
1  Count on
Love how Tobi is the only responsible one who uses his mask 😐
Harry is a beast
Callux: let’s VIK beat him in squash because he’s not having a good time   Everybody liked that
How is this 80 k calories video?? Anyone?
their rowing form is absolutely painful to watch LMAO
JJ ain’t coordinated lol. Compared to Harry his gym form is poor
Anyone know where Ethan got his jacket?
Can someone explain 50:05 please 😂
If harry learns how to box he’d be an absolute monster
25:52 who’s gonna say it🧐
1:47 that girl in blue hella cute 😭😂
Yo yo what about Neo and Morpheus do they need to do this I would love to see a ripped hamster or two ripped hamsters with Abs of steel
ay the sidemen watch Nelk, ayyyy 43.16
Just looking at Harry physique i know that he did exercise and he is fit. Not sure why so many people are surprise of it
Harry MVP
Watching the NELK boys in the background 👍🏻
25:47 thank me later
Harry surprised everyone i see lol
Finally people are realising how much of a tank Harry is I wish him and jj would have a spar
When the 2020 year ends and they didn't get the 10 mil subs target cleared, it's gotta be jokes if the sidemen splits and they introduce wideman as the name of their new group
i can only watch this video while eating
I'm a star boy
12:52 Lmao why is Jake Paul in the background?
hello I'm new here is KSI and JJ the same person? I keep losing braincells 😭
For all the lonely guys 25:49
The gaining calories team felt like they were on drugs🤣
ayo that girl with blue sweatshirt kinda cute at 1:43
Bruh anyone else judging tf outa jj’s burpees
Logan Paul gets around😎https://youtu.be/41baMYcCR0w
It’s sad how I’m 15 and I kettle bell swing more than KSI
13:38 Why does Vik look like a dolphin when he does burpees
25:46 im cant focus on what hes saying with her in the back🥴
Harry may be addicted to several hard drugs but we still love him
Did y’all also feel the ground shake when jj started to jog in place in the beginning? Yeah me to
omg, My dad is a rower and it bothers me that JJ doesn't know how to use a rowing machine 😭😭
Simon has now made a new disease CUPCAKE 19
Who else saw Ethan when they were on the bike
Vik wasn’t doing the rowing right he wasn’t going all they way in he was only going half way and then going back
25:49 in the background thank me later.
Bezingha is the most annoying person ever
Everyone talking how strong Harry is but am here laughing at this clip 🤣 30:44
when was this even recorded?
Nobody:  The comments: *Harry’s so humble I can’t believe he’s so fit*
I prefer the humble Ethan.
hell yee stevewilldoit on the tv at 43:15 ahahaha #FULLSEND!
i love josh’s laugh
They on piccidilly
18:05 is nobody gonna tell him his shirt is backwards?
harry has a lot better form than jj
43:16         Sidemen x nelk ???
Lux got all my respect !🙏🤝👑
Everyone is talking about Harry. But I’m so happy for vik. Like I’m proud for him
cod players: yo where the buses
natural selection is going to get harry one day.
This comment section :  A good ego boost for harry
I actually want to know that workout. It seems like a great mixture of weight training and cardio. You’d get some lean muscle from that.
16:35 whys the cloud like that
Vik the equivalent of the qwop game
Thats so much cap i searched it up them fries are 300 to 400 calories, they are not 1000 calories 😂😂🤦‍♂️
Whats up with tobi?
Ethan is getting fat again his bellys getting bigger each sidemen video hope fully he dosent go back to the old days
yo tobi is full of bs. Man was at 2k cal and jumped to 3.2k for eating butter lmaoo
Wait harry isn’t fat he’s hench ahah
Harry looked v good in this aha  Better then usual
This video is the representation of my mentality towards working out
GIVE US REVERSE NOW!!!
5:19 JJ?
I can feel my spine breaking just by Looking at JJs form on the deadlift.
honestly they don't need to invite dat guy
25:49 stop looking, I know your looking😉😏
25:50 ;)
No disrespect to callux but they could’ve got someone that’s more into fitness like reev or something
JJ is so fat so he has No balance
ethan's breakfast alone has more calories than i consume per day
Yo I see u cameraman 25:45
Tobi is the worst cameraman, it’s mad
The kings of adds
Harry is the Adama Traore of Youtubers
Anyone know what watches they are using?
What watches do they have on?
40:00 LOL
I just keep finding it more and more amusing that Ksi was able to beat Logan, I mean he doesn’t seem athletic at all, but I guess he wanted it more
Callux using cancer as a curse word like he’s from The Netherlands 😂😂😂 *in Holland the word cancer (kanker) is seen as the worst curse word to ever be used*
I absolutely love the wind up merchant mood that Josh is in for this video😂😂
The fat people watching this that are 80’000 calories watching the video. Like this
25.45 damnnnnnn girl, i'm distracted
37:40 Harry gettin checked out by the ladies
These dudes need new content. They've done this same video 5 times 🤦🏾‍♂️
where the hell did they pull the '80,000' from in the title. typical from them
Bruh id give anything for Leons trainings
I'm 16 and can do more than half of them
Harry went from a spaghetti to a mega chad
Harry’s technique is amazing it’s so much better than anyone else’s. If he carried on doing this he’d be a beast. Big up Harry 🎮🏋️‍♂️
they should do this in america 😂
Harry will be on that gymshark sponsor after this 👀
they should do a vol 2 just to see how they would do in switched positions
Part 2 but swap teams 😂
the dude they zoom in on at 27:27 kinda looks like onion man.
6:20
25:46 ;))
Pop quiz: What is harrys most famous phraze.                      Answer: Hide ya wife ive got a kni*e.
"She was blind tho" ha
I just realized Wonka bars are an actual thing in UK
34:20 the moment Vik gave up on life 😂
Did no one see josh just barge that girl when running from ethan
Boring video
48:18 Why is JJ only doing half strokes?!
This video made me hungry even tho I just had dinner
JJ's team: goes for a jog to Nando's  JJ: It is my chance to flex
This is not my first time watching this video for Harry and I'm not ashamed 😭❤️
The sidemen should make a fear factor challenge
Plot twist: Harry is the backup weapon against jake
I don’t think we can tease Harry about being fat anymore.
yes we got another calorie challenge boys
25:50 baddie in the back
u guys should do it revers vik harry calux and jj eat
Are they still quitting if they didn't 10 mil subs before 2021
0:29 2:04 3:54 4:55 6:23 7:53 8:43 9:43 11:13 13:05 14:14 15:37 16:13 17:45 18:55 19:42 20:36 21:36 23:33 24:54 25:34 26:53 27:43 29:13 31:05 31:55 32:52 33:33 35:50 37:02 38:32 39:41 41:28 42:43 43:51 44:53 45:43 46:39

Best sidemen video?!
Leon is a fcking UNIT bro...
any military person ever watching jj do his pushups 0, 0, 0, 0, 0...
Not a hate comment but is anyone else really fed up of eating videos or is it just me?
Simon took that cupcake like it was nothing, i can see why JJ still lives with him
Is callux’s shirt on backwards
Funny how JJ brags about being the best and how it is easy, while Harry completely destroys him by doing no sport whatsoever lmao
Sidemen really never missed
Feel like Harry is the fittest among all of em lol
Harry is actually cool with this...💙
"i can do it in a video game i cant do it in real life" vik a goat
Harrys form was so good, and better than jj's which really surprised me
callux is an old man lol
This is content
If I had a pound for everytime viks voice cracked I’d as rich as jj fs 😯🤩
So are we just gonna ignore the the girl in 25:50
Vikk Harry cal and jj: running Simon Tobi Ethan Josh: playing racing games
3:05 🤣🤣🤣 JJ is like a seal jumping in the water 😂😂
25.50 the girl on the treadmill damnn
how is kirsty in both shoots?? she'S photographing with bith teams wtf
Willy will wants to do a trade
✨cupcake-19✨
Harry is surprisingly fit
what was the random light flash at 39:21
Bring the intros and outros back
Who thinks the sidemen should do beta squads video of living on 1 pound for 24 hours?
The bunndah in the background
Shout out to harry, jj, vik, and callux they really pushed themselves all the way in this video
Sick form u lemon JJ
we now c what it looks like when big joshy consumes too much sugar
Nearly made it to 10 mill!
who is the peng ting in the grey shortsssss jeeeeeesshhh
Sidemen should do sidemen rugby
Looking forward to ksi memes of him running on the spot...
At the start was a sick beat
who else wants to see harry train with leon and get absolutely jacked
We need a video were they switch
Why is Callux doing these workouts in a jumper
wait a minute... what's the discount code?
I like how they talk about an average or a total as if it makes any difference to who wins
think for the first time ever, I would actually want to be in the burning calories team, looks f littt
it took me half way through the video to realise what they were doing
I didn’t realise Harry is so hench. What a tank.
Could someone explain the part about the free food that Ethan was talking about? Couldn't quite understand.
that one weeknd song clip got the video claimed
Everyone in that gym looked jacked. Maybe my gym is more family friendly / casual but even the girl at 37:36 is butch lol
Why are blue team celebrating all they had to do is eat it’s harder to loose weight than to gain weight so I think red team take the W this time
Bro why ksi in every sidemen video thumbnail
Why does jj have 11 mil but not this channel
Sidemen should do ice hockey
Why is this trending
Harry is a beast fr
Damn I really wanted the guys burning to take this, mad respect 👊🏼
Holiday
The Sidemen should do the Amazing Race that would be sick! Of course, after the whole covid thing ends
25:48 she got 🍑🍑🍑🍑
Harry and Ethan against jake and Logan Paul that would be lit 🔥🔥🔥
Corona wants to know your Location 😂😂
46:51 near lux's arm thank me later
HARRY NEEDS TO BOX
Callux really is the epitome of a white person  Man said squash LMAO
Vik should have been eating he need that weight
KSI motivating and helping Vik during the gym session. Everyone liked that.
26:52 Piccadilly
4:35 CupCake-19🤣😂🙂😐😐😐😐😐😐
I like how one team are going all out in the gyms and the others are just walking a eating junk
ethan after going on a few jogs: bRo
bruh, i ate 212Kcal (packet of M&Ms) and that's equivalent to 212,000 calories. Am I tripping or are they eating way more than 80,000 Calories?
This isn't even close the other way around😂
Oi, watch this 😂😂😂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKlsCsChu0g
OMG Harry Potter "spoiler" on 32:50 🤣
I need a sidemen podcast on Spotify
Y is jj saying a grand like his broke 😆 🤣 😂
This video increases my appetite while burning my calories at the same time.
Let’s hit 10 mil before the year end lads
go to 43:20 their watching nelk
I've not met a single PT that actually teaches rowing technique... The return has to be arms first then knees fml
these guys should have a cash prize whenever they do eating challenges
think ethan needs a new face mask😂
NELK in the background big up
Harry smashed that tbh
Jj is a pro boxer and gets beat by Harry😂😂😂 wtf
New sub
Rematch but swap who eats
Sidemen golf off?
the sweet shop they went to is extortionate i paid £10 for a packet of cheetos
JJs form in basically every exercise was dreadful. His Erg form was actually atrocious hahahah
36:23 what is JJ doing he need to take some tips off of harry
Claim here after 5 million
Harry’s form is better then jj
although the workout is may seem to be too much for Vikk, i feel like the fact that he can still complain that much in the video means he isn’t at his limit
bro if that Leon workout was easy for JJ, was he making him do 100 sit-ups 100 press ups 100 squats and 10km every hour for his boxing? 😭
jj burned 800 calories from just sleeping..   his fat layer probs made him sweat
Am I the only one who feel like Harry has been workin out he is looking shredded
i wanna know where the number 80,000 came from 😂
25:45 for the boys
everyone scranning fast food with a personal chef in the background 🤣
JJ did not do 50 + push ups.😭
what fitbit does jj use
The thumbnail is disturbing lmaoo
This proves KSI is always training
I'm Feeling Hungry Watching This.
They need to collab with Pride and Pinion
win free food. Humane Hancock made it !!
Vik : * defeats Cal once * JJ : * misses the first serve many times * Vik  : * misses once * JJ  :  Ayo na na Vik  has no hope fam.
FULLSEND 43:43
29:38 Confirmed Ninja wtf literaly heard nothing at max volume and the dude is a giant
Don’t think JJ had good form on anything he did in this 🥴
They need to do it again switched roles
Harry's a beast
A bit of the blast from the past but remember when the sidemen made vids like mini golf and zombies and dead by daylight and GTA and they invited someone called wizzite? What happened to him why did he go? Ik alot of people did wizziteout or something but he was funny why did he stop making vids with them?
25:50 the girl in the back ;)
25:50 how was looking at the bundah🤔🤔🤔😳😳
Really entertaining if only it could be little bit longer
37:20 camera man looks like old fat Ethan
17:18 the place in the og sidemen bingo
The sidemen are so good, they can keep everyone entertained the whole time throughout the whole video. I wish I could do the same in my videos.
Tobi's always slacking at these food things....
a good idea would just basically redoing this video, but with the teams swapped
9
25:40🤩🤩
It all started with the beer belly. Now look where jj still is today
20:00
Harry is a Beast!
I’m glad jj is on the exercising team because he needs to work out for boxing
I just realised when were gyms open 😂unless it was filmed before
That race was actually super entertaining
JJ working out? Somethings wrong...
25:50 boys!!!!
Harry is sooooo gooood!
Now a sidemen and nelk combo would be naughty
Simons is a proper waste of everything
We want sidemen vs beta squad crossbar challenge
Harry beat callux yes
Anyone know what watch JJ?KSI has on? Is it a Apple?
How were they constantly changing clothes
imagine harry and jj in a boxing match that would be a close call
I think i could watch Harry work out all day 😍😍😍. His form in dead lift is perfect. Hes got some real stregnth and did so well!
24:06 We ignoring the thick baddie behind them 👀‼️
Im so proud of harry 🥺🤩
38:00 is ethan looking a little big bigger or is it just me
25:50
27:25 Which place is this? I have seen so many of KSI's public videos here too!!!
Right Ethan?
25:50🎂🎂🎂
25:23 Thats sick, did not expect that.
Tobi giving Ethan the Iron Man was like Toby from The Office when he won a toy for Pam
fking love Harry, what a guy
If only losing weight was as easy as eating..
30:18

That’s my dads gym lol It’s called gym box
31:57 lmao
what watch that JJ uses?
Moresidemen needs to cut out just the burning
"ClAiM yOuR hErE bEfOrE 700 bIlLiOn ViEwS tIcKeT hErE"
Vik said the most relatable thing ever “I can do it on a video game but I can’t do it in real life”

Who’s just surprised Ethan isn’t on the “Healthy” side?
If Harry wanted to be a boxer he could
We can all agree, we caught JJ lacking, Harry was showing him >:)
This is boring
Any one else skip to the workout part
What does Tobi actually add to the sidemen
Is vik leaving coz he joined a cod clan
Harry is a beast
Tobi the only one respecting covid all through the video
YOOO harry is jackeddd uppppp
25:51 that girl on the treadmill Is dummy thick we like those
The vibes on this vid are immaculate, love it!! <3
Harry is so humble unlike some people “cough cough” Jake Paul
Did it upset anyone else how terrible their rowing technique was?
Nobody:     Toby: Bone apple teeth
25:46 hows the nnn going bois!!!

Stan Tobi for wearing a mask
Do a sideman fitness challenge
25:50 look in the background
CUPCAKE-19 was very clever. Nice pun josh
min 30:19 it gave me this scary movie type of like a guy grabbing a camera and recording him and his friends smiling and laughing and going to the beach and driving in a beautiful blue sky with the sun out all beautiful and fun then it cuts to like its zooming out of the camera or phone and theres like some scary dark in a warehouse or something like that lmao
40:10 jjs fake laugh is glorious
The counting is wrong at the end where's Harry's count
which one of yall is in the kitchen
ksi lost to harry not callux😭
JJ’s deadlifts were horrible form. harry’s were way better
Wish i could do those kinds of push ups....
Can we appreciate how much harry bossed the workouts, man was doing better form than jj
29:22 the guy in the back has me dying🤣🤣🤣
Nelk in the back 43:00 lol
they actually used the minecraft hunger bars tho
25:53 i can see their motivation 🤣
So nobody's gonna talk about how the sidemen watch the Nelk boys
Treadmill🍑
In the background

<<<< Scary Channel OMG
Call the firefighters 'cause Harry's on fire!!!!!! Damn....
Am i the only one who thinks harry can beat jake paul with the right training
25:42 on the treadmill 🤤
Harry is a beastt!!!
I love how Vikk hear's about the burpees, turns to the camera and his eyes just read sheer panic. Who knew we had so much in common?
This just shows how much of a beast ksi really is
Looking at those English breakfasts.they look peng.so now I am watching this making a breakfast for brunch lol.
25:50 thank me later
JJ's deadlift form 🥴
Harrys lowkey fit asf hes underrated on his fitness
Y'all actually need to give JJ some respect, saying that Harry "way stronger than him". Y'all saw his form at the start?
Dream vs Sidemen Manhunt  please make this happen
Vicks HR went down to 100 because when your body fatigues your body makes your HR decrease
30:00
Harry looks out of shape, i was surprised how well he did in that gym session.
Josh was soooo funny in this video
Dudes eat some pancakes and sausages and a bag of candy and say they feel sick 😂😂😂😂 us americans built different
These guys are so inconsistent with masks 😂😂😂😂😂
hey gorgeous guys! Who else is trying to grow their YT channel during quarantine. Let’s help one another. Much Love
25:52 If u know u know
Sidemen is slowly turning into more sidemen
What smartwatch is vikk wearing?
Vik the best athlete!!!! No doubt!!!!!!!

Yo guys we only got a month and a half to get this chanel to 10 mil and moresidemen to 5 mil so please sub to both
43:36 who wants a sidemen × nelk boys Collab?🤔
Vik just complaints for every thing every week🙄🙄
Am I the only one thinking that they should do this again but reverse teams?
Harry is actually more capable to win a boxing fight
What’s crazy is if josh and Simon hadn’t eating those 950 calories each at the end for the fries they would of only just won by 28 calories
What cal called Ethan  at end ?
I didn't know that in London people sell the Quran in the streets. What has Europe turned into? 🤷‍♂
hold up, at 0:00 the way vikk spoke and the musc playing is so in sync
Came here before 10 million 🥺💍
KSI gassing up his fitness when Harry plays a bitta footy and is fitter😂

Petition for JJ to do a strength test with harry
Same Team and switch to see who really won ?
Just sayin they didn’t eat that much
This vid was awesome, but man I couldn't help but notice Jj's deadlifts. Bruh, that man HAS to clean that up if he wants a spine by the time he's 30, tbh Harry probably had the best technique out of the lot
Im still confused to why they dont just eat like a bowl of pasta for 1,000 calories
Someone ran out of ideas
Support
Why is no one talking about 51:57 That was the funniest part of the vid
3:48 She's peng
Dude did anyone else see that at time 25:51???👀👀👀
Vik really just said "I have never felt so cheated in my life"
JJ Went Super Saiyan At The End
vikk's watch scammed him
46:00 look to the right
Good video. I like it. Hello everyone, I made interesting video. Who will put to like to my video, i will send 1 dollar  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgSWDqJPob4&t=12s
25:49 behind Leon
I think the trainer was shocked by Harry
19:25 the noise that woke me up literally a minute before an earthquake 😏
When they watch NELK 🤩
Why is Harry looking taller than JJ?
Harry’s my favourite
Damn Vikk really had to film the intro in front of his 3 gold youtube plaques.
we just gonna ignore the completely yellow chic @ 47:13
Callux: i wish i was good at something  Also callux:”destroys everyone in squash”
I really underestimated Harry in this one
Aren't we in lockdown?
Ethan lowkey hates josh
Harry’s actually strong
I like josh but his laugh is hella annoying.
No one  finna say anything about 25:48 ...
شششضضحةككككك ،.      كةةةكككككك
44:30 the girl on the right side tho😳😏🤤
Who are these guys and why are they popular....this was a waste of my time trying to find out why this is on trending...
Is it just me or does harry look bigger every video
Yo Harry needs to fight someone at the KSI vs jake Paul event  Did u see this man in the gym the guy could beat Jake if he wanted to
25:50 girl in the treadmill 😏 thank me later

25:49 dayum

Anyone noticed ksi is in a good mood doing push ups and that
5:14 anyone notice ksi voice crack 😂

Video Idea: I'm a Sideman... get me out of here
The most forbidden documentary in history: “Europa The Last Battle” at archive dot org.
After this video harry and vik JJ callux gonna be strong while simon tobi Ethan and josh be pooping rocks
Anyone see they were watching nelk
Bruh gufjtjfgdjgjvyjvjhjgj
Imagine doing this everyday      Im meannnn what Jj did
Im i the only one or i just skip to the parts with jj vik harry and cal
oooh sidemen is watching nelk
they out here watching nelk leshgo
Harrys kinda mad yknow
Get like joshes team was drunk or sum, especially josh
Callux’s favorite sport in the us is called racketball
Who’s just surprised Ethan isn’t on the “Healthy” side?
If harry works out daily he would look great
Last 2 sidemen videos were just alright. To hit 10m come with a banger
the food team was just vibes lol
Tobi a real g
jjs deadlift form is the worst i have ever seen
26:00 the camera man gifting us
Basically dwayne johnsons everyday routine.
harry,  loses 1k: ugh ethan, gets iron man toy: OHHHHHHHHHH
why did harry just turn to an absolute beast in 2 weeks
25:48 the background fam
The guilt in vik‘s eyes when he realises all of this is his video Idea XDDDDD priceless
why isn't ethan on the workout team?
What are the watches they have? I'm trying to track the calories that I lose per day and don't know what's best
It is today I realised Harry is a beast in the gym
Great fun video big thank for it
what smartwatch are they using?
Harry is in better shape then ksi👀
waiting for Jake Paul to mock jj for being tired
3:35 some experience from Jj 😶🥲
Vik: dying from doing box jumps Simon: contemplating whether he can eat an xl sandwhich from burger king
Can we get a SIDEMEN MAFIA
Vik belongs in video games
lowkey this has been one of the more boring sidemen sundays
I now see why Callux isn’t in the sidemen, he’s way too cocky
Did anyone just get a notification for this video a day after, or is that just me?
Shout out to callux for being a really good friend
Harry should keep this workout plan. He looks good
Get them to 10 mill pleaseeee
Anyone else asking themselves how kirsty teleported?
I would like the same video but reverse
37:45 - 2014 Ethan has been sighted
ethan is getting out of shape now
Is it just me or was JJ looking really in shape
At 26:34 why did it sound like josh threw up
25:22  SIDEMEN PERFECT
Cause JJ weighs the most, he uses more energy just to move around. Makes sense as to why he burned the most and Vik burned the least
Stfu Vick ur life is a scam
25:48 your welcome lads
Callux and Callum need to join the sidemen ASAP
43:10 LETS GOOOO NELK
Vikk did well with this video idea 🔥
I think we are all waiting for the next charity match but with this going on we won’t see one until who knows when
I lost 5 kilos just watching this video.
Not me feeling superior.. JJ and I do be having matching fitbits 😌
25:49 man's got a nice left shoulder what can I say
Does anyone else feel like the audio for the eating/unhealthy team is really bad
I held this video off idfk why but Man oh MAN was that a bad choice  this is a Saturdays are for the boys type of vibe
why is ethan soo loud
26:50 lol he was proper embarrassed there, hence why he started acting up
Harry is an absolute beast
26:18 Ethan’s hood landed perfectly on his head
18:50 fam i was watching that
this is proper like watching a series elite videos I'm only 15 mins in seems like I've been watching an hr its 4am sidemen content is next level!
LOGAN PAUL VS KSI BEST 2 OUT OF 3
Its so painful watching KSI's technique on the rowing machine

Bro I hate eating vids
So this channel is now an eating channel lol
If i was in the eating videos i would be winning cus i can eat alot and when i say alot i mean alot(im fat) i can eat 2 pizza boxes without stopping if i want to
Simons team was just having fun through out the video while harrys team was just struggling and putting the effort😂😂
I would love to see all the Sidemen in a trainning session with Leon, that will be a dope video!
That girl behind the trainer at 25:37😳😳😳
25:48 who that she got a fatty
Tobi is so boring
How many times are they going to do this challenge? Its getting old
They was in Piccadilly
Vik was deadlifting 135😭😭
JJ got that wap
Harry beat JJ in his own game
Bro they really put our fatneek on the healthy side and put Ethan on the not healthy side lmao 😂
43:17 there watching nelk, imagine a drinking challenge haha
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeqFsrWFRVA
Ethan stop saying "bro" bro.
Tbf Harry's gym technique is stellar
We ain’t getting sidemen videos next year Boiz 😪

Harry is so humble unlike Ethan sometimes
The dimes at the beginning
Anybody else see the camera woman dodge Ethan’s kick. 26:30

Nobody: Not a single soul: Not even my dead dog: Not even vik: Everyone in the comments: “MaN HaRrY iS sO hArDwOrKiNg bUt oNlY iF hE aLwAyS dId ThAt wOrKoUt”
Why does vik do burpees like he’s a penguin
Cop pulls me over for jogging over speed limit 😭 https://youtu.be/817n6l5mrkM
no one does it better than the sidemen consistently the best youtubers since the football vids
Sidemen should do some kind of swimming challenge
Who saw this number 11 trending?
Wow Plz visit my channel
If Harry stuck to doing this everyday he could literally complete against JJ like on thing that JJ is on a whole nother level ‘Boxing’
Wow... Plz visit my channel...
Harry is so humble unlike some people “cough cough” Jake Paul
If Harry stuck to doing this everyday well lets just say ✨WOW✨

25:50 who’s that bhadie
Don’t lie who else is a FAN of Sideman 🐝” “¡ᴍ ɢɪғ₮ɪɴɢ ᴇᴠᴇʀʏ🅞ɴᴇ ᴡʜᴏ ʟɪᴋᴇs ᴀɴᴅ sᴜʙs ᴛᴏ ᴍᴇ” 🍯
Send me the liverpool mask, will be much appreciated lmao
GO CHECK THIS OUT https://youtu.be/QM_J51O58Kw ITS INSANE
The amount of mouth shots we got from Ethan made me think he’s just got the calories from the camera
Is it just me or I preferred watching the Sidemen working out rather than seeing the other boys stuff their face with burgers😂🙏🏼
When it zoomed in on ethans face mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Callux is entertaining
Who is that who's at the squash Place with them guys?
Credit to Vik, JJ, Harry and Callux tho
i like how one group was just playing around while the other was just getting straight up tortured
This video was just a cover take make JJ lose weight that fat neek
Harry is a genuine KILLER in the gym. MASSIVE RESPECT BRO!
The only thing interesting thing about this video was jj vik Harry and callux’s workout
Why is Tobi even in the video? Dont talk, dont do anything!
Honestly, Vikk seems like the type of friend to keep the environement positive no matter what. His energy is nice, dunno😂😂

JJ is a freaking animal bro
2:45 BUNDA

How can Kirsty be at Leicester Square and at Gymbox with two separate teams at similar times? o.O Unless both locations are nearby and so is Simon's and JJ's house.
Big up the sidemen watching nelk boys
25:48 🍑
Harry's deadlift form is a lot better than JJ's, that surprises me.
Ethan better get back on the weights or he is going to be fat again
@38:58 I’ll take his place next time
If Harry were to train like this everyday he’d become One punch man
My dad plays squash

Harry must have been on drugs for this 😂💯💪🏼
25:50 😏 In the background

25:49 the boys got some motivation in front of them
josh is to cringe
34:00

Looks like the eating team toke some edibles for callories
That ethan dude look like one stuck up dude, he look like his fingers need to make an appointment to scratch his head.
Logan Paul taking notes on how he f*cked up in the fight
Wow Harry’s a lot stronger than expected

This was dope now they just need to switch lol
Harry got that farmer strength🔥

Gotta love the sidemen watching the nelk boys on the tv, imagine a collab with both of them, the internet would break
Boys watching nelk in the background
“It’s not covid, it’s cupcake 19” lmao
37:40 the ladies checking harry out no cap
The sdmn should do a sidemen Olympics.  They should bring in a bunch of UK youtubers and have them compete in 7 events that are based on each of the sidemens strengths. They could score each event out of 10 and whoever gets the most points gets to officially be an honorary member of the sidemen, or money.
Get that six pack Harry! 🥵
25:51 😳look the bundah
i want them to swap the teams and do it again
one team clearly had an advantage,  - they just had to eat and the other team had to train and exercise
Tbh this has to be one of my favourite sidemen videos
Just what jj needs
12:34 Is no one gonna talk about Callux sweating from his belly button?🤔
are we all gonna ignore baby girl with all that cake in the background at 25:50
it didn't know fatneek could move  somewhat quick
Im actually starting to get abit known in london beacuse of these vids, and ive never been there
Does ANYONE know where Ethan got his coat from
congrats on #1 trending!
The fact that america don't have wonka bars piss me off and is the reason why I want to go to the uk
JJ's deadlift form should get him kicked out of the gym, jesus christ.
Jjs form on those deadlifts got damn
My dad shattered his arm elbowing a wall during a game of squash 😂😂
JJ IS GONNA BREAK HIS BACK WITH THAT FORM ON THE DEADLIFTS
Where is Ethan face mask
Put your f*cking mask on. It’s not that difficult
This video is literally jj, vik, harry, and lux working out. Then behz, josh, tobi, and simon on vacation.
Anyone else hate how Callux is so full of himself...
Bruh I haven’t watched sidemen in a minute, when did w2s get so thicccccc
26:32 wtf was that laugh
Do the same challenge but swap the groups around next video 👀
Just got done, eating 15 chicken tender piece with mash potatoes and gravy from kfc, currently feeling like a fatass
The sidemen are so good, they can keep everyone entertained the whole time throughout the whole video. I wish I could do the same in my videos.
I thought Harry was Ethan like 10 times
broo harry lowkey diesel, he should keep working and get jacked
51:14 YOOOOOO CAAALLLLL
25:51 for the lads bundaaaaaa
26:05 they must be motivated to keep running
Help support tbezzy johnson on youtube
We just gonna ignore the bunda at 25:50?
I just noticed callux and viks bars were so light in weight in comparison to jjs 😂😂
KSI’s form in the gym was terrible. Those deadlifts and kettlebell swings were so bad.
25:39 she got bunda
Discount Code?
What was the Code for this week?
Notice how they put all the fit and skinny people on the gain weight and the rest on loose wieght🤣🤣
Why does Ethan sound like a junkie 😂
Vik: "I can do it in a video game, but I can't do it in real life."  Literally every gamer in existence:
It made me legitimately smile when Tobi gave Ethan the iron man plush
45:60 thank me later        Bunda is mad

Harry should 100% go to the gym more often, he makes it look easy
Ethan vs Steve will do it eating challenge
Slacking eating a English breakfast and Burger King wow
I think the eating group are overrating their calories. Thats way too much for what they ate
Sdmn made this year much better  If they are not in YouTube rewind ⏪   😐
KSI Doing half pushups lmaooo
Ksi needed this video
Harry’s low-key a unit
Let’s get them to 10 mil by the end of the month
How much of JJ first 800cal were burnt of wanking first thing....
Tobi is that one guy in the group who everyone just loves and no one can hate him
Tobi’s love for the iron man toy is like KSI’s love for Vik
Lool the old man they zoom in on at 36:45 is known as magic man on my estate 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
37:35 that girl was looking at Harry like 👀👀
Pog
The sidemen channel inspired me to chase my dreams and goals 🏆 I just started music and released my first ever track moments ago please don’t eat me alive but show some support my checking out my newest track much love 💯💯
They should’ve put Ethan and josh on the exercising team and vik and cal on the eating team. It probably would’ve been better for everybody
Big up Kon for giving us an angle on the girl on the treadmill
Feel sorry for vik in that squash video. Glad he laughs it off what a guy
Vik still using the dodgy watch
25:45 CAMERA MAN KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING LOL
Callux: ‘I hate being bad at stuff’ - is bad at everything
Hurts that we gotta wait till next Sunday ffs
I’d say Harry is more fit than JJ
Ethan's ptsd intensifies every bite of junk he takes
JJ was mad when he didn’t win the grand but it’s not like he actually needs it, walking around with beers chain hahaha
So nobody talks about 25:49 or?
We need more ksi and harry
Was simons team drunk the whole time lamp
it would be sooo funny if Harry fell in the river
Something to watch while i have corona
Anyone wanna play a game of among us? If so then DM the user: slay_b3lls
The eating group was so boring
Why am I more into josh and simons race then the rest of the video. That’s a zerkaa Thursday right there.
Never let josh vlog
That woman’s checking out Harry at 37:35
Jj seems very happy in this video. Love that
im. ngl jj looks really slim in this video
bro that one girl at the gym wearing gray booty shorts is looking peng god damn
r
25:49 🍑
They gotta do a part 2 with flipped teams

No one noticed the cake🎂 in the gym
I love josh.
Swap teams for the next one
44:36 hurts me as a rower
Weak Sidemen Sunday
Creeper
Stevewilldoit on the tv🤣😭
They do the same thing every time when trying to eat lots of calories and go for sugar. Surely they know every gram of fat has 2.25x the amount compared to a gram of carbs.  Higher fat food and they’d win easy
Aye that girl behind Leon at 25:45 is FITTTTTTTTTTTT, aye woman if yous reading this yeah, get to me
I’ve won that iron man before!
STORROR x Sidemen collab? Each member of Sidemen and Storror are paired up and have to complete challenges across London or bigger.
That booty at 25:50
Who ever was filming the game made me dizzy
Ethans mask not on his nose is annoying me already and I’m like a minute in
They gotta swap teams for the next vid.
Can't wait for the reverse, Simon is gonna die
Why did Simon look like a grandpa when he was eating that cupcake, Love u tho
Harry beat jj  Jj-“let’s check his monthly listeners
Can we stop with the food content now. It’s getting really boring and I just refuse to watch whenever it’s to do with food or calories. Ik content is hard atm but please do something else. Even drinking would be a lot more entertaining
25.52 the girl tho
They’re watching nelk boys at 43:30
peak nelk boys in the background. collab waiting after covid?
Callix or callfreezy are the ppl that I would allow to join the sidemen 😂
0:00 Viks voice syncs with the music
harry did many drugs I bet he had steriods to
drink coca cola bro
I have the same watch as JJ 😂 *Fitbit versa 2 for anyone wondering* 👍
Josh was so funny in this video
We need harry to box
No one chatting abt how callux belly button is wet
I do that everyday
43:09 Peep The Nelk on the tv
I’m actually surprised they watch Nelk
“Im first! It’s me, it’s me, it will always be me. NO.”  😂😂😂
on  the tv there watching the Nelk boys lol
44:57 Toby actually sounds like George st Pierre
This song is so relaxing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGAwqXrjArk
Seeing josh genuinely happy and laughing makes me feel good dunno why
5:12 CALS GOT TEKKERZZZZZZZ 8:52 LMAOOOO 10:00 CONTEEENNTTT So far the only 2 times Lux lost was to Vik.... the least coordinated 11:50 Let's be honest, Harry wanted it the most 20:17 lmao 21:19 that's poor, Simon 30:36 XD 30:42 LMAOOOO 40:14 LMAOOOOOOO  51:14 YOOOOOO
25:50 lads 🤤
Didn't they say they would never do another eating video? Last time and the time before that? 🤣🤣
25:50 in the back 🥵😂
Who would have thought the drug addict would have been the best lol. Much love
34:02 she was buff
The closeups of Simon and Ethan have me dead
25:50  thank me later boy
Leon taking one for the team and standing being the girl on treadmills my g
ayo drop the full outro instrumental
Why for gods sake is jj wearing  vapor flys when training in the gym.
When Josh started zooming in hahahahahah bruh these videos be the best
Harry’s faze x champion hoodie is next level
Jj deadlift🤣
25:40 girl in the background got that 🎂🎂🎂
What was the app they were using to check the calories
Turns out jj is as active as he says yaaaaay lol
Anyone notice they were watching the nelk boys on the tv
The sidemen  should do a climbing video
25:40-26:00 look in the background
Anyone else thinks cal was so cocky 😂
25:40 nice treadmills they got in the back
25:48 🍑 👀
25:42 🎂
Bro KSI doesn’t know how to do push ups and that’s sad yo
Watching them eat so much chocolate and stuff made me feel so sick.
finally something callcer is good at and its bouncing a ball off a wall
Who saw Nelk in the background 😂😂😂
Josh: Tries to enjoy Donut  Simon & Ethan: No
Come on jj
Harry did it for his brothers back in Cameroon 🇨🇲👊🏼
Who saw steve willdoit
Harry should start squash
😂
Sidemen look like mega mind
Simon holds his knife and fork the wrong way round
I didn’t realise Harry is so hench. What a tank.
Honestly just do sidemen su Day play squosh that was fun to watch
That breakfast place where they ate at was just playing banger songs
harry got that inbred strength
harry fuckin smashed it
I want harry to box someone in the near future. His mental is just ridic. Lol
Sidemen please, less junk food, I want to lose weight! xD  Seeing your video in a trend, I want to open the refrigerator and eat everything, But I'm holding on support in the comments guys <3   Who also follows the diet?
Discount code?
I hope they do this again with the teams switched
Tobi is boring tbh
Can we get a vid of Harry and JJ sparing
I am proud of harry
Harry is actually a beast
The dude who was giving free food was Humane Hancock.  His vids are actually super interesting.
Who watched the whole videos
We want a sidemen version of I’m a celeb get me out of here :)
Can anyone tell me what watches they were wearing?
Don't explode! 😂
Vik and Ethan should've switched places
ßØŽØ
ßØŽØ
JJ: what's have we figured out today it's easier to eat than to train   Lux:right Ethan 😂😂😂😂
I think Harry would actually be a madness of a boxer
Harry is so naturally athletic, if he worked out more often, he could compete with JJ.
Ethan saying ‘bro’ after every sentence, is he autistic
Iron Man doll everyone likes this
At 37:40 it looks like a woman in the back round was checking out W2S
*Spoiler Alert: Callux doesn't lose because of a double or nothing that harry lost
42:29   The old Ethans back
why are all the comments about about Harry ?🤨
next challenge should be the leon challenge
Is it just me or should Harry do a body transformation, I bet he would look amazing absolutely ripped
25.51 in the vid and look in the back ground
what isn't harry good at? he's legit the best
This is still number one on Trending
These are the best type of sidemen videos
Vik getting triggered by his watch!!! 🤣
yooo chick in the back right at 45:45 mad fine
nandos must be good since Vik gets it like every video
Callux was an awesome addition to the vid! If he could just replace Tobi, the Sidemen would be complete 🤩
Harry would be a monster if he works out at the same magnitude as Ethan or JJ. Man's got the farmer genes and build lmao
harry would need a long time to train to beat jake lmao , boxing sint about strength. jake has been boxing for 3 years, harry hasn’t trained boxing.
25:48 anyone see that bunda
No one:  Harry: Its game over, its game over  😂😂
Who saw the woman in the gym
51:15 Savage Callux Moment
Pt. 2 where the team switches
RIP JJ's back.. carrying Vik in the rowing machine race
6:27 this is why we hate VIC
harry vs jake paul
Sidemen should do a 10k plaque opening 🤩🤩🤩🤩
45:41 👀🍑
JJ’s over here doing 55 push-ups and I’m over here barely getting to 9
This has just become we eat a lot but never enough challenge
Big up vik for the squash he was gassed to beet Callux
I swear Ethan gets stoned for the eating challenge
Ethan should’ve been on the other team
Harry can rail me
25:48 nice booty though
36:24 jj is lifting that kettle bell wrong hes going to hurt his self ifbhe keeps that up
8:20 Can someone explain why beans are a part of a traditional English Breakfast? It makes no sense to me. Everything else is so good and fits well with other breakfast foods, and beans just... doesn't
It's really nice to see JJ and Simon not being on the same team for once.
160,000 COME ON GUYS WE HAVW TO GET THEM TO 10 MILLION
Sidemen vs lux squash with a pro umpire, winner gets 10k?
22:53 now I'm craving Pringles 🤤

Bag head
JJ has the worst form I have probarly ever seen in a fitness center
Couldn’t help but notice at 25:50 🍑😂
Stop doing deadlifts!
Tobis face when he said he wants a large woper meal😂😂😂😂
Anyone know what watch KSI was using at the start of the video? Also any recommendations on sport watches?
Nando’s healthy ummm I think not
Hey it’s Piccadilly from MW I’ve killed plenty of people there
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKZ1E5v-zkpQKqO59AYinww Christmas gift
43:34 Nelk in the background
5:12 that was actually so clean
1:10 Lmao no wonder JJ's trainers said Simon does better pushups than him
We need a part two with the roles reversed
KSI popped off in that fitness especially with the rowing man is built different
I got the mask its fire and fits perfectly
trying to get calories....coca cola zero on the table....Bruh
lmao 43:00 that guy in the background
Harry and jj in this video 👏
Ethan: see i put something in the bin  Also ethan: doesn't put it in the recycling side
Harry’s got that natural farmer strength, if he continued training with Leon, he’d snap Jake Paul like a pencil ✏️
Sidemen never disappoint
True
Harry could be jacked if wasnt so lazy lmao. That guernsey farmer strength kicks in lmao
Simon would have died if he was on the other team
At 40:00 What kinda Fitbit versions are those? anyone that can help me?
Nobody going to point out the girl checking out Harry at 37:35 ?
Who else thought then holding the cameras themselves was 10x as funny😂
Next Zerkaa Thursday , doing the Sidemen gyming calories
25:46 Listen to what he is saying and not......
The workout crew where more enjoyable to watch IMO
Callux should join the sidemen
47:00 the girl in the background was looking JJ up
When jj did a dive in the squash I had to replay that like five times
what's up gamers, over here at explosive gamers we have many things to offer, such as:  giveaways   fun bots   weekly events   an active community   the ability to become staff    and so much more!  link: https://discord.gg/dnbfQe8
Can we stop doing eating challenges it’s boring
Hey guys, take a second to subscribe to my channel for great content in the near future!💪🏾
Great video
#GETSIDEMENTO10MILL they deserve it
4.4M views in one day😳
25:52 that girl got bunda
Poor Vik, the dude was dying. That would be me.
Do "Sidemen News Channel\Broadcast" on the main Sidemen Youtube Channel, I mean as a funny video of course
Sidemen should do this again but switch which team did exercise and the eating.
I rate if Harry properly trained he’d be able to beat Jake Paul in a boxing match
43:25 watching nelk love to see it lad
Ad
EVERYONE SUBSCRIBE PLEASE I DONT WANT TO LOSE MY BOYS NEXT YEAR
sidemen watching nelk
As a rower their form pisses me off
Harry the only real winner throughout the whole video
Jj most serious sidemen video
Is de la soul playing in 9:40?
Can someone  tell me what that red jacket is that Ethan is wearing. Would be much appreciated.
Let’s go #6 trending
25:46 the girl on the machine behind leon
JJ’s form on KB swings 🤦🏽‍♂️
JJ with his big mouth all the time, he has nothing on Harry though....
How many times ethan gon say “bro” in one sentence?😂😂
one of the most boring sidemen video
43:46 Sidemen are watching Nelk
18:08 Callux telling strangers to get out his way 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fact: As opposed to the myth, people who follow the diet while doing strength exercises gain muscles
25:50 now we know why jj goes to that gym
I like how it’s kinda a vlog but a challenge at the same time. And the two teams are getting up to two completely different things 😂
Ayo boys help me out. Who’s the girl at 1:46 ???
Vikk Harry cal and jj: running Simon Tobi Ethan Josh: playing racing games
next video should be a day in the life of the sidemen
Nelk video in the back at Simons house  let’s go baby🐐
Doctors: balanced diets are good for the body so please eat a balanced diet   Sidemen: *we don’t do that here*
Tbh I think Harry should start boxing training and go against other coz I think he'd actually do really well
Damn, Harry is a different breed...       Inbred
25:50 I don't understand why people bring cake to the gym!
The biggest thing I learned from this how in shape and strong Harry is. Vik was regretting everything and Cal is never going to say yes to being in a video again. The people getting to just eat had it so easy. Definitely figured the eaters would win. But it was a lot closer than I expected.
I like Tobi, but he might as well of been the camera man in this video. Hardly participated at all 🙄
We demand teams swap next Sunday. Same teams but this time  JJ, Vik, Cal and Harry are eating when the rest is exercising. It would be  like home and away champions league battle
Honestly though, that was poor form the eating side. Not of them even looked like they struggled. The exercise side were dying while they were chilling
41:10 anyone else notice the chef back from sidemen come dine with me 🤔
Congrats on 2 Billion total views!
Love KSI but his ego gets too much. wish he takes himself down a peg
Harry’s form on the deadlifts was amazing I’ve been trying to improve my form recently and it’s hard
3:43 That moment is gonna be everywhere on reddit I stg
Me watching this on a diet: 👁 💧 👄 💧 👁
This is how many people would eat over loose the calories  👇
25:53 anyone very very distracted??
Anyone else happy to see Jj fully in the gym again he’s going to be in a different weight class for the next fight at this rate
Awesome video 💪
Am i the only one who doesnt like callux and calfreezy?
38:25 big up my man specs Gonzalez
38:30 big up my man specs Gonzalez
The camera man coming in at 26:02 what a boy
They’re watching nelk

Boys everyone sub to sidemen cos at this rate BBC will get their diamond play button first.
Ok but lowkey I reckon harry has some serious genetics, especially in strength, imagine if he trained hard for a year, could probably pull 4 plates
We want All Sidemen Gym session
Apparently vik had never played squash before
25.48 your welcome
RiceGum would have been SCREWED in a fight against Harry 😂
#1 trending lets goo 🙌🏻
JJ's deadlift form is terrible 🤣 Harry had perfect form tho 🙏💯
What was Tobi coat called
Harry should train
who else noticed that they were watching NELK/Stevewilldoit at 43:15
It would be so funny if fat Ethan was on the calorie losing side
25:46 mad in the back tho
We just gonna ignore the fact Matt Doherty is in this video 32:58 behind callux
So the first 5 minutes  JJ callux vik and harry are playing wall tennis  And tobE Simon Zerker jerker and muscle man Ethan are busy takin drugzz.....I mean eating food in one bite and pretending to get sick
i think harry should be in the next boxing fight.He is unbelivebly strong .    I know I misspeld the word unBeLeVibl<L
did lux said 'kimak' at 49:28 ? xD
Sidemen learn parkour. Sidemen x Storror? Please?
'
Undesevered win
About 0.16 million and we reach the goal spread the word
Let's be honest vikk is a cry baby😂😂😂
Hearing Josh and Simon saying things like 'mandem' and 'fam' is just cringe
starting to doubt jj’s ability to beat jake :/

25:38 I refuse to believe I was the only one who was distracted
Sideman be like another one
25:51 can we just appreciate the view in the background please?
Tobi is too good for this world I swear down, man is bare nice y'know.  That moment where he won the Iron Man, and immediatly after getting gassed, gives it to Ethan, and he gets gassed.  My heart moved mad innit

Respect for this vid ppl mad thing💪🏼🔥
43:30 S/o to nelk
everyone in the comments is adding more respect for Harry, and I agree
I enjoyed the exercise team more than the eating team. Not saying that i dont enjoy the eating team but what the exercise team did was mental. And what callux said during the deadlifts was quite inspiring.
Yo Harry looks like he’s being bumped by JJ in the thumbnail
Yo Simon is going bald
Respect on Harry
46:01 paused 👀👀to the right
nobody talkin ‘bout callux swearing with cancer😂 i think it’s funny tho

Vik and Ethan should have switched
25:39 Yeah, I totally heard what Leon said yeah...😂😂😂

The person who burned calories the most was the cameraman
Why does the lady at 3:48 looks like Mia Khalifa
They're just trying to get ethan fat again
Things I learnt during this video: 1. Harry is actually strong/fit 2. Vikstar has an addiction to BPMs 3. Zooming with the camera is peek comedy
Why does Callux have bellybutton sweat?
26:01 oooooo
no one finna talk bout the bottle flip simon did like tf that was insane

This video shows that JJ is training for his fight with Jake. I hope JJ wins though

WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO EAT 80,000 CALORIES
25:50 your welcome boys
They should make a part 2 and switch the teams around
43:17 miniminters TVs
Bro why's no one talking abt how fit that girl in the backround is when they were doing rows
if Harry would actually try he could be huge easily
They call him a fatneek but he is a literal maniac
Harry is just built different 😤
no cap add callux to the sidemen
25:48 none of us were listening to Leon at that moment 👀
Can we take some time to notice how hard Harry went and even his form was better than JJs
Please do this video again where the teams are swapped

7:16: What the sidemen would look like if JJ actually left in 2017, Vik joined Faze  & Harry cared even less about youtube
25:50 thanks Kon 😉
Does anyone else think Harry would actually win in a fight against JJ if he actually trained or is that just me?
Wait I’m confused did Harry’s score counted or not and why is everyone talking about Harry in the comments can someone clarify
Just 200 k away from hitting the 10 mil!! Keep it up boys
Visit my channel
They should have bothered with the eating bit in this. They let the side down.l very boring. The exercising was so fun to watch.
25:50
Sidemen? no, fitmen and fatmen
I only read the title to say they drank the Oreo chocolate shake
These are the best sidemen vids. Harry w the humble grind. Cal digging at Behz gotta be the highlights
Harry stepped up! Love it lads
43:10 who notices steve will do it in the background
Respect to cal
Tobi picked the best biscuits in the world
10 mill soon!
Harry actually had a very good form in all these exercises in the gym

Anyone know what watch they all was wearing please I would like to get one ✅👍🏻
They should do one more with swapped teams
43:24 u can see the nelk bois on the TV
Shout out kon for having to run with those dudes and hold a camera
This group isn’t the same anymore
They will never do it but just add callux n freezy to the sidemen
25:53
25.47 look under his chin. YOUR WELCOME
Who else was more invested in that JJ vs Harry squash game than they were in the JJ vs Logan boxing thing
Mad respect for the boys that worked out and a bit for the ones that ate no offense
Omg bro jj’s fuckin form in the dead lifts and the rest of the workouts is disgusting 😂😂 Harry’s form though was so good big up Harry bro
Tobi a real one for giving Ethan the iron man
They should do the same video but swap everyone around
We all know where jj is looking in the treadmill
Damn I love Harry
Josh recording like they filming paranormal activity

Josh recording and pissing of Ethan and Simon was to funny
When Callux found how hard it is to be a sidemen

43:09 Love to see the sidemen watching the Nelk Boys!
Watching the gym session was the best part of the video. That should be a whole vid on its own. Amazing
Why do Ethan, Josh, and Simon wear those ridiculous rings? Men shouldn’t have rings on their fingers unless it’s a wedding band.
did anyone else notice the wink at 29:31
They need to do a part 2 where they swap
43:40 nelk boys blowing up in the UK too
Anyone noticed the chef in the back 41:09
bloody love harry tbf, tons of respect for him
JJ can actually have those fries, peanut allergies are based on the protein of the peanut and nut, not the oil
When full send is in the background
25.50
What has happened to Harry he is looking good
yall should do another one of these but the teams switch what they do
This video has inspired me to get a domino's delivery dinner later lol
Anyone know the song that was used at the 15:30 mark
I like ya cut G
This is astonishing 💪
Whose sad the training session wasn’t with Phil
25:47 So who was peeping it too?
guess the girl in the back at 25:49 was a good motivation
4 ads in 7 minutes. nice
25:50 np
After this video, everyone thinks that Harry can knock tf out of Jake Paul.
me 15 and can easily eat the entirety  of the groups calories
Miniminter everyday: 10 calorie challenge (GONE WRONG)
Guys please I need the Boyz my mum  told me if I get to 1k subs by the end of the week I'm getting a new setup " my dream" so please guys help, I need your help😔🙏, I have a laptop and my dream Is to become a big YouTuber plz help
How is Harry fitter than jj
That arcade racing is gold.
Hey number 1 in trending keep up the good work
JJ deserve his punishment cause he is too fat
26:09 is it me or that’s Piccadilly from MW
I always knew that harry was one of the strongest in the sidemen.
25:50 👀
I was just watching the 10,000 calories challenge and saw this vid
Congrats on trending
Harry’s wham yuno
Pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes.... full english...
Is it weird that being in the Sidemen would be my dream lifestyle?
Why dont they wear a mask😤
does anyone know the name of the song in the background at around 38:00
We all know jj at the start didn’t do 55 push ups 😂
no one:      ethan: bro bro bro bro
25:50
This was a mad one.   "Bread and wine tings, hold tight Jesus" had me creased hahaha
Forgot to jump in the burpees
Harry's actually in a better form than jj
Every comment how harry is a beast, but is no one talking about how mad josh's and ethan race was?
Harry's officially the fittest sideman.
43:15 they watching the boys   fullsend babyyy
oy are we just allowing KSIs press up form at 1:24, no wonder mans been bulking for so long
Harry finally showing his Farmer's strength bruhh what a stressful video tbh
jj shadow boxing wrong, make sure throw ur punches upwards
Shows JJ, VIKK, HARRY AND CAL. Watches video Cuts to Josh, Ethan, Tobi and Simon, continues to read comments
Harry looking low key big
4:15 camera man nut shot
25:50 😳
Vik did amazing considering he’s smaller
7:44 Simon : Macncheese  Josh: yeah cheese and mac
25:50 fat bunda in the background yano
Would love to see Harry put his strength and size kinda toward boxing training and see how that turns out 👀
Anybody else see they were watching nelk on YouTube😂 FULLSEND
Great Video❤️‼️
25:45 brothers
Got to be the worst - boaring video I’ve even seen 🤣🤣
Harry and jj reminds me of my friend and I when we do PE and stuff
can anyone explain how it works when one says "give odds"? ive seen this interaction happen a couple of times between some of the sidemen but I still have no clue how it works, I think because im American
Tobi getting that Iron Man and giving it to Ethan is rly nice :)
1:46 anyone got the girl in the blues snap 😂😏
JJ acting like he just took 55 pushups
43:25 is that my man (Steve will do it) in the TV?😂🔥
Harry has the guernsey strength
25:49 for the boys ;)
Vik has improved his soccer skill now his squash skill
y does harry sound like borris johnson😭
I’m actually getting annoyed now they DESERVE 10 MIL!!
32:43
Loved watching the rowing session Seeing them all back each other was solid
And I thought that Callux was bad at everything. But he smashed playing squash!
I couldn’t stop laughing when they zoomed in on Ethan’s face
I am one of the oldest fan of sidemen, I subscribed them when there was 22 subscribers, I m 23rd. Love ya.
This is starting to become Ethan’s channel and I don’t like it...
How hench is Harry getting please
No one gonna talk about how poor JJs form was during the entire video?
3:39 Simon will be able to eat Pani Puri easily ig 😂😂😂😂
Jealous they actually got on a squash court
Toby doesn't look very happy about the new normal
Ethan needs to clam down on the word  bro haha
25:48 above leon’s shoulders
❤️
Will never understand why the eating team decide to eat sweets instead of actual food...
Its actually sad that we have to go through corona now, i just saw the 10k calorie video and now they gotta stick to the rules and wear masks etc. I hope we will go back to normal life soon
31:44 how homevideos look
JJ needed this.😂
Pink blug hahhhaha pancake
check 25.40 😏
swear josh was ok somet this video
JJ's deadlift form makes my back hurt..
Harry's physique just looks really good.
I want to see the roles switched.
Imagine if this video wasn't recorded
Any runners out there also cringing at the fact JJ is wearing Nike vaporfly next% shoes?
I don’t understand why were there 3 scores for viks team what about harry
i spent a hr watching people eating and killing themselves
1:52 wtf is even the point of wearing a mask if your nose is exposed
I'm sorry but I'm going to un sub bc u  pear ed up with Leyton Orient and  I'm a dagernham fan
Ethan finally back to his natural habitat
43:00 that guy on the right is moving proper sus 😂
Harry is a beast though. Congrats to him!
Plz subscribe to my channel need your support
Mann harry is a beast !!
0:00 Vik actually killing this beat
I skipped every time Simon Ethan and Tobi cause they were boring.... who else did that? And they were very happy that they won challenge....
25:52 I’m gonna need an Instagram or something, please I’m starving
Harry and jj wearing $500 worth of running shoes😂
the actual sidemen need to be the camera men in some vids
43:35 nelk boys on the tv. The bog stevewilldoit <3
48:10 When she says she’s home alone (talking about jj)
25:50 Girl in the back ground
Come on lads we need to get them to 10 mil I can't survive without Sidemen Sundays
Plz subscribe to my channel too plz need support
Vik: "I can do it in a video game, but I can't do it in real life."  Literally every gamer in existence:
is funny how zerka is 30 and he's having fun  zooming
Wroetoshaw vs Jake paul would be more interesting imo
number 1 on trending
Number 1 on trending
Just can’t put my eyes off Harry’s form 44:30
Big up Harry
34:58          pov: u yawning
I like how JJ does pushups like a begineer at 1:18 . He doesn't reach the floor at any time
The most intense race
Harry smashed that workout, he’s actually one of the fittest out of the sidemen!!
the addition of cal is decent asf
When is Toby getting kicked out of the sidemen?
This comment section is so wet
26:01 👀🍑
KSI & Jake Paul twitter beef dissing mum https://youtu.be/BGavXcQqCvc
Not a push-up was done by jj that day
Harry needs to train and fight jake paul 😂😂😂
14:25 That awkward moment when your patchy chest hair sticks out your t-shirt
How much does Toby eat on a normal day😂
Harry actually pretty fit ngl
Wait why couldn't callux do the hip thing?
25:40 don’t mind me joy started from here...
Nobody can call Harry lazy and JJ a fatneek   Respect
since when the sidemen watches stevewilldoit or NELK boy bruv😂
Guyzz 26:00 thiccc
47:52
My new favourite quote  “Hold tight Jesus”
Harry’s form on all exercises were hella good jeez.
Callux should be in sideman full stop
43:25 the boys watching nelk love to see it
44:28
Harry is a freakin BEAST
Ethan needs some new material instead of having bro at the end of every sentence
Know what dude, I enjoy watching the sidemen eat as much as any other guy, but the burning half of the sidemen carried this video for me. Now if you'd excuse me, I suddenly feel like a quick run
Is it just me or did Lux look like a homeless man (at the end)😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Harry is low-key the strongest and fitter out of all of em
so close to 10mill lessgoooo
Harry is actually so attractive 🥵🥵🥵
can we stop the calorie challege though?
I am not starting any beef but the form on these guys in rowing is horrendous
Petition to reverse this so the teams swap!
Sidemen vlogs like this are great do more of this
34:33 that dance by tobi was sick
Go on jj
JJ lost the first exercise drill in the gym to someone that sits home and opens fifa packs and builds drafts
Why are the cameramen never laughing, these guys are jokes
How Harry won and lost a grand.. actually got gassed for him.
Vick is so unfit for any sport 😂
Also when Jake Paul throws his left and right he puts his head down
I dress better than Callux and i’m actually poor
21:45 someone please send me the link to that hoodie KSI has I looked all over the gymshark website I cant find it
its sad knowing how much the sidemen eat to get full, when my fatass can eat 3x more and still be hungry
Vghhulolkiifor ujj nnkklplllmmmmmm
That form on them push ups ksi😂
2:14 only the filipinos will know whats wrong on this angle🤣
ik people complain about ethan being cocky or whatever but man lost sm weight if i did id be proud too man
Hey guys I know this is not to any important but we need to let JJ know that when Jake Paul throws a left he throws his right very heavy to knock out people we need to let JJ know so he can look out for that
There sure are alot of bots in the comments
Bring Cal for more episodes
Did anyone realize that jj has bad push-up form just saying
i recon i could destroy the sidemen in a calorie eating challenge get me a q of velvet gelato and see what happens
The booty at 25:52 🔥
Josh is getting grey hair, we are loosing him soon
Is this about who gains or who loses 10,000 pounds
Thats not a proper burpy😂
25:46 - Look behind Leon, thank me later..
Did anybody else see the girl checking out harry in the back left  at 37:35
25:51 Now I know why they chose the back line treadmills... xD (background)
Ethan is starting to look like his old self
Harold smashing it 🔥
Guys!!! Remember!!! They’ll stop sidemen sundays when we dont get them to 10 million by the end of the year!!!
Anyone know what coat Ethan is wearing.?
25:49 They all working to impress the baddy in the back🤣
Harry in this video using his farmer boy strength
Video ideas Sidemen bleep test Or any other fitness related videos
Yas & UK #1 Muay Thai fighter Josias Gomes padwork https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kvcA7Sefsc
well vik is never getting sponsored by fitbit
25:52 girl got some cake in the back
Did anyone else get rona vibes from tobi
Drinking game: Take a sip every time Vik says "BPM"
what is 80k calories about this video?
Harry is kinda buff ya know?
25:50 the girl in the back is fit ngl
Cals a different type of baller
If they wanted to gain weight then they should have went to their grandmas house
25:49 thank me later
The calorie group was doing the one bite challenge instead.
ethans acting fruity ngl
Aight now switch the teams!
#FatEthanReturns
Harry bossed this.. Fair play
“Cup cake-19”😂😂
25:57 the girl in the back has a phat bunda
25:51 your welcome
Oi tf, thought it was going to be burning and eating 10k calories in one day
I dont think vik realises when he wins something physical it's because they let him win 🤣
0:37 what watch?
It's only right we get a part 2 with the teams switched in roles
Harry is an absolute beast
wait why didn’t harry read his number?
3:40  KSI reddit do your thing
31:03
19:45
dont know if its just me but i feel like ive seen too much of ethans face for a video.
It’s a very good thing they put JJ on the burners.... cus he kinda needs it
I can’t help it I just really dislike watching Callux. I find him super cringe
Big props to Vik and Cal to pushing through the workout. They did well.
Vik the type of guy to sit out in PE
tobi is dry af with his fake laugh :/
I have been to a few eSports finals in my time; that car race between Josh and Ethan might just be the most exciting ive seen yet😂
Bruh I thought Ethan was drunk
the best thing in the sidemen whenever there is a challenge they never complete it
I kinda want JJ to fight Harry instead of Jake 😂
Is harry a white ksi if he can workout and get as fit as him
Toby boring af. Stealing a living.
Love Breakfast club.. id eat there every morning.. never go and get a full English though
Stop giving yourselves like 3 hours on every challenge and actually complete one for once😤
Everything miniminter does just does my head in
Please stop making the same video over and over again with differe titles
25:45 all boys be looking
Callux held it down snm
good video. loved it!!
The eating bois should've worked out a lot more
Cal, Vikk, Harry and JJ: Working out  Simon, Tobi, Josh and Ethan: Woo mario kart and iron man!!
0:16 Ethan,Simon and Josh: Lets all wear sidemen masks and not tell Tobi.
Reverse the roles, so JJ, Vik, callux, and harry eat as much as possible while the other team loses as many calories as possible
callux looked like the 40 year old dads u find playing squash
37:36 oi oi Harry's got an admirer
Fat ergs😤
Watching nelk in the back 43:33
Loved the part where Tobi got the ironman for Ethan!  Truly a respectable guy
20:00
25:40 the  girl in the back on the treadmill
No matter what else everyone says about them, Harry and JJ are the fittest/strongest Sidemen
tobi is the most likeable person on youtube, respect.
Reddit won't even acknowledge JJ's physique from this video.
I quite seriously enjoyed Callux in this video. Also in nearly every other video he is in. MORE CALLUX!
I think we're due another MukBang!
Burning team were Gs, loved the effort, seriousness and comraderie.
The Sunday after Next... Sidemen should do a MukBang/Drinking MukBang...   I just enjoy them sitting around the flat talking.
they were watching nelk at 43:34 LETS GOOOO!! NELK TAKEOVER 🔥🔥🔥
Vikk has the worst hand eye co ordination from amongst all the brown boys around the world.
JJ Tried his best to catch up at the end but it s just too much.  Proud of Our FATNEEK❤️
JJ's great but Harry is a f*cking beast.
the intese gameplay betwen josh and ethan holly cow
Ok
Man, Harry killed it. I demand a drug test
Jj is using marathon / running shoes to play squash!
For real tho where tf did that old man disappear to 😂
25:46 look the bunda
I surprised jj can count to 55
That's Why He Look Fat But He Is Not 48:21
My man JJ cannot even do a proper push up.
Now they need to switch
37:28 that guy walking up the stairs all tough 😂 even tho he skinny
25:50 the chick in the back ;)
They should do this exact video with the teams reversed and see who wins
Every one is talking about harry
I eat 4,500 calories on a normal day. These guys doing 2,000 on a challenge
Same video, teams swap
Swear Tobi added on bare calories man
they need to do one of these in LA so they can smoke then they’d be able to eat hahahaha
43:37 watching nelk
harry looks more like an athlete than jj :D
jj getting thinner and athletic
Who’s here before 4 million?
"We don't need no walls" - vik 2020
I wanna see Harry box - I actually think he’d be good
Claim here before 10,Million
U should do it other way round as well!!
25:40 onwards.... everyone thank me later
Is it just me or harry looks stacked as hell
omg when Tobi won the Iron Man for Ethan 🥺
BANGER
Why didn’t they have Ethan doing the fitness one would’ve been a close race then🙌🏻
Was this recorded during the second lockdown as all the gyms near me are closed ...
We need a part 2 where the roles are reversed and then see what the score is over the 2 days
Can I make this clear, this is a calorie video and Ethan Simon Tobi and Josh spent half the video in an arcade. Lol 😂 This is why I love the sidemen
Anyone else see the boys watching nelk 😍
the ethan joke hurt my buttcheeks
Sidemen should do scotch matches on the next sidemen Sunday
36:30 song?
22:51 i bet that no one was concentrating with what he said
why does vin jog with his thumbs up
Damn Harry is an absolute beast.
not lying, i was skipping the eating and just watching the training
What bunch of muppets, this world is too far gone
Be Honest Who's Been A Fan For A Long Time?  (Also Gifting To Everyone Who Subs To Me💕)
So close to 10 mil now boys 👆👆
150k left for 10mil subs
the workouts was way more entertaining than the eating
I think Harry should start a body trasformation series where he works out
Callux flexing so much in the squash court😂
Yo does anyone know the song at 10:49 in the background??
25:50 thats some bundda right there
OK... I need to know is squash an actual sort or is it British tennis .
Love how Tobi won Iron Man Ethan
JUST REALISED THEY WERE WATCHING NELK BOYZZ SIDEMEN IF U SEE A LIKE WOULD MAKE ME REAL HAPPY !!!!
Stupid josh
anyone wanna talk about how lux wore trackies and a jumper basically the entire video
Just saying, he's lookin' a bit F A T 37:42
Gyal at 25:50 didn’t wanna work out just wanted to show Bunds
No offence but Jj's form is not great
That back in the background 25.50
I think they should make a new video and then now the eating teams burns calories and burning one eats
Petition to stop the eating challenges
Ethans mic is fucken awful my ears were dying
i know what ur lookin at 25:49
Big respect for Tobi never taking his mask off even when the others didn’t wear one
if sidemen don't play mafia I will unsubscribe
There was a mass gainer behind them 46:33
Love the way Nelk is on in the background they need to collab
Simons height Jj‘s mindset  Ethans commitment Harry’s farmer strength  That would be a mental build
Harry and JJ should train more often together. They push each other 👍🏻
How is Jj's form so dead on deadlift?
Petition for Callux to join the Sidemen 👇
25:52 u welcome BOYS 🍑🍑
25:50 i mean motivation is also needed...
Harry has actually smashed it
Don’t miss this-https://youtu.be/ylG-w5QT64Y
Is vick good at any sport
The amount of clout harry is getting , oh my gawdd
Tobi looks like a KitKat with that red jacket
I feel so sad when they eat their food in one or two bites like bruh that looks so good enjoy the food man :((
Come to me my sweet peach!)
Okay okay they won, but we all know who the real winners are lol
I think Harry, cal and vik all need props for their effort
I swear there was hella tension throughout this whole vid between everyone
nelk are everywhere
Harry bossed the workout
Bruv how did jj lose 800 calories in his sleep did he shag someone
Do the sidemen not know the squash roles?
Tobi giving Ethan that iron man was finna cute don’t lie
They should reverse the challenge so jjs team eats and ethhans team burns calories.
Harry is an absolute beast
20:00
25:40 only me that saw the background
they watching steve will do it
19:32 has me DEAD HAHA also hench Harry hench Harry hench Harry
Anyone notice how Simon looks old
If jj doesn't beat jake We have haroldinho
I love these so much
Another amazing sidemen sunday video. Brilliant!
I was actually doin my homework but this seemed more important
Their in Piccadilly .The worst map in COD history
25:40 nobody is looking or listening to the PT 🤣
@4:10 ha ha
the 2 of the funniest and the fittest sidemen -JJ and -Harry
They need to make a part 2 and switch roles and add both of the totals together from the working out and the eating to see who does the most
Is it burning calories or gaining weight? Can someone tell me someone pls.
It's easy to eat, hard to train😭 It's easy to gain weight, hard to lose it.
Anyone else see that at 25:50 or just me
I guess everyday videos and more than 10min
Aw god Viks banter has got to be the worst
Some says the ironman plushie gonna give the sidemen bad luck
Josh zooming in on the boys was too good and idk why😂😂
Whats the discount code?
80,000 calories American edition
Pains me to see jj wear the next% for anything but running
25:38 🍑
There are two types of people in this world:
Anyone saw Nelk at around 43:35?
If Ethan says “bro” one more time we should all unsubscribe
harry please fight logan in a boxing match
Omg they play squash
this is how many wins cal has
When they eat   It’s the best!!
44:29 bundah at the back right
When leon jumped and didn't make a sound so satisfying
Harry’s farmer strength coming through
Next week it should be other way round   the team that  workout should eat and the team that ate should workout
The guy at 21:44 in the back is a lad
Ethan's vocabulary is only the word bro
Nobody: Ethan takes off mask Also nobody : Ethan puts mask on
Harry form in the video is better than jjs
Guys plzzzz help this little creator  https://youtu.be/RLMKh7d0K9M
Harry is an actual BEAST. Hold tight BEAST MODE!!
Do a reverse now
Cupcake-19
callux should be the 8th sidemen
Thrope park flashback at the arcade!!
Damn
I bought ur Sidemen merch
how is no one going to mention the girl at 25:45. Unreal peach on her
Sara literally broke callux's heart
Harry's got a good physique ya know, imagine if he was serious about working out and trained with leon
harry with a good trainer could win a boxing match against jj
jj looks fitttttt
Hello
im glad it took a sidemen video to get JJ to start burning carlories again
damn harry be looking clean yknow during that workout sess
Harry stamina is very good
Why does lux always do exercise in the weirdest clothes  Never just a t shirt and shorts😂
25:51 Bunda
They should do sidemen cricket
Love to watch this reversed
big up kon for that shot at 25:51
Please do more videos like this one. It’s really funny to watch.
I was more interested in the workout side of things
Harry is good man ❤
Anyone noticed ethan is becoming fat again?
That diss on ethan at the end 😭
how is no one talking about Leon looking WHAM
Hey hello friends
Hey friend 😀
i like how callux thinks hes a GOD 😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYIeVwnclxM
If Harry was to stick with all that training he'd be built like no other sideman😂
4:37 Cupcake 19 😂😂
Low-key Harry is a machine same as JJ either one of them can beat Jake Paul furthermore Jake Paul is a nonce
12:40
Let's start a petition for the sidemen to do Does the shoe fit with Filly and Chunkz.Like to let the Sidemen to see this
Im leaving this video cuz i m hungry
Sqaush is such a Callux sport, not complaining though
Legends say Simon is still choking on the Red Velvet cupcake
25:52 in the background
Big up call for the roast
Did i just hear cal say "oh cancer this is so fast" he turning dutch slowly or what?
I thought gyms were closed during lockdown
harry’s actually turning into a unit
There's a few thousand calories of cake at 25:51
Who else just liked the video even before watching
People in the comment section have seemed to forgot Harry was the 3rd or 2nd strongest sideman in the strength challenge from a while back
32:59 Adam Lallana?
Im a liverpool fan I want that mask
I just realized that callux has better beard than jj
My mom: we have applewatch at home. Applewatch at home: 00:38
We don’t want KSI vs Jake Paul. We want Harry vs Jake Paul
Abonné et like
Felt like I’ve lost calories watching this :|
Video idea same thing with teams swapped
Sidemen nearly got that 10 million, thank god they will still be posting.
Ethan has great experience in both putting on and losing calories he is truly the greatest specimen
Harry is an actual beast man.
37:36 hahaha the chick in the back’s checking out harry
Only me that wants to see sidemen play SD on cod more on moresidemen
25:50  thank me later :)
ITS GOOD THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO LOSE FAT BUT WE WANT SOMETHING FUNNY TOO🤔🤔🤔🤔
25:50 Where are u lokking?
being a rower and watching their technique is devastating, also JJ's deadlift technique hurts my back
I Completed The Challenge While Watching This Video,Sitting On My Sofa...
Mad respect for Harry but Vik I am very proud of him I really didn’t think he would finish the workout but he did big ups to JJ, callux, Harry and Vik they did so good
Imagine they did this but then the next day they swapped and did they other challenge?
It needs to happen the other way round
SHOUTOUT TO HARRY FOR ACTUALLY BEING A BEAST IN THE GYM AND STILL BEING HUMBLE ABOUT IT
HARRY JUST BUILT DIFFERENT
25:45 thank me later
Did anyone knows the meme with that tall white guy in a plane which aggressively says: "I want to Shake his hand! I just want to shake his hand!!"  Reminds me of Ethan at the end, would be a golden joke If he drops it in that moment
25:49 what was the guy saying?
Plot Twist: Sidemen Specifically Made this video To Make JJ Fit
Big Harold’s built differently.
can‘t lie.. the pringles in the thumbnail that Ethan was eatin got me quite hungry..
Harry is unstoppable 👊🏻
Josh: Tries to enjoy Donut  Simon & Ethan: No
They should do real life rocket league / car football
And when I do this, I just get fat wtf...
Their watching NELK on the TV
25:49   Who that shawty😍 in the background???
Watching this video actually made me feel sick cause I can barely eat like 500 calories 😂
Jj a beast
Ahh gang they watch the nelk boys too, they should make video together 😂
Til this day I still don’t know how to play the odds on game
Damn, Simon a throat goat
We need a part two with reversed teams
i miss the gym
i want a cheeseburger
whys harry doing better than jj
i don’t think the sidemen realise how happy they make us
*6:28** VIK HAS FLASHBACKS TO SKIING...*
oyyy i beg we get a sidemen squash off
JJ needs to sort his back out in those deadlifts and the kettle bell swings
To a non-athelete like harry, he's actually decent
Harry is so down to earth and doesn't talk big about himself
wtf are those push ups jj jk
Harry did a better deadlift form then Jj
it pisses me off how JJ is wearing nike next % in the gym
Anybody notice that they were watching Nelk
25:50, gonna ignore that cake huh??
This is defs one of the best sidemen videos
who went to get food before watching this just so they wouldnt get hungry during the vid?
It was at this moment that Harry knew he was meant for greatness
Who else now really wants to try out
Whenever they do eating videos do they buy the cameraman food aswell?
Not sponsered by pringles😉
Damn ksi beat the air up wtf
This needs a part 2 with them on different sides
I love sqash
At 43:23 they were watching nelk boys as i can see Stevewill do it with full send shirt !!! On the TV
Toby is always a buzz kill
Harry and JJ’s team were so organised and hardworking in this video and Simon and Ethan’s team was just shambles
Why didnt Harry's calories count lol?
Im gonna tell a riddle. What is one thing everyone in the world has seen the same of? Theres not multiple only one visible
why is josh so childish
Harry is an absolute unit!! Smashing that mate!👊
At the very start when vik said “my heart feels like it’s going to explode” goes well with the beat
17.30 smart boy Ethan... Smart boy...
Harry should be a Gym Shark Athlete after this video
Don’t mess with Vikks heart rate 😳😂
Jj's legs are sticks lmao
I lowkey think harry can fight ksi  He never had those intense training sessions and still went head to head with ksi
Sidemen:burns 80k calories Me:Watching them while eating my pizza
Big up Harold, kept up with JJ
the best part of these sideman sundays is at the end when they start fighting
lol viks deadlift form
Harry is million time more athletic than JJ, doesn't train but can keep up and do the exercises with much better form than ksi
What happened to JJ’s foot?
If the Sidemen get to 10 Million subs before The end of 2021, JJ goes Bald. Make the Sidemen see this | | V
I knew Tobi was gonna give Ethan that Iron Man plushie
Love that toby gave the iron man teddy to ethan
25:50 bundaaaaaaaaaaaa
KSI is like the serious hardworking version of JJ
Peep the nelk boys on the TV
when vik said "i've only got little legs" i felt that
What’s the type of watch they use?
What is tobis coat?
Harry is the only one who did the deadlift right
20:50 at first I thought that was vik's chest hairs lol but its just the mic
I honestly thought Vikk would do better, since he's been working out, but he absolutely bottled it lmao.
I actually wouldn’t be mad if Callux joined the Sidemen
These vids are the only vids longer than 20 mins that dont bore me
less than 200k to 10 mil, lets go!! there's only so many accounts i can create
shouldve subtracted the calories they lost from their total
Hi
This Sidemen Sunday:   Harry: Surprisingly fit af  JJ: Serious and dedicated  Vik: Stressed and but gives it his best  Callux: Unfit but doesn't give up, very refreshing  Behz: Extremely likeable. The life of the group.  Zerkaa: Eats A LOT and still stays in shape TBJZL: Silent but chill af  Miniminter: Eats A LOT, yet scrawny. Laughs a lot too.  We like it
Claim here before 4 mil ticket here
i swear only the brazzers intros were like that lmao
Yoo I’m loving all the respect the comments are saying about Harry.. it’s about dam time!!
51:15 what did callux say?
JJ, Harry, Vikk and Callux have produced so much electricity that they could light up a 2BHK House.
We need part2
that gym has an unreal amount of cake
ethan,harry, tobi and josh makign fun of simon reminds me from when me and my friends wud hangout lol
DREAMCATCHER WAS PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND AJASHASDF 14:08
Nice to see people play squash. It is an absolute amazing sport. 💪💪
Video idea Sideman goes to the gym
josh's zooming looks like those scary movies where it's filmed by the cast
we need the same video again but the teams swap eating and exercising
when corona virus ends why not have a sidemen and nelk collab 👀 at 43:13 they watching them
KSI Fatneek probably lost 10 kilos just from doing 5 pushups
48.:40 jj never loses XD
Surely vik is better at cricket at least surely
I have the same watch as KSI
Omg think of something different man how many calories videos have u done now...ffs
What watch was jj wearing at the start of vid
I wonder how many people came to the comments at around 25:48 🍑
3:02 when jj felt the power of playing  squash
43:15 nelk boys full send babyyyyyy
This vid is soo gooood I love these
Any one clock Behz & Tobi's bromance in this vid
JJ needs them shoulder blades touching.
Harry still got the Guernsey's farmer boy strength
How else noticed they were in piccadilly 🤣
25:52 must say the boys definitely had motivation during their 1km run judging by what I can see from over Leon's shoulder ;)))
Anyone know the hoodie JJ’s wearing at 21:45 ?
no one gonna appreciate my guy stevewilldoits apperance 43:33
The 1k fries was bullshite
JJ’s deadlift form is whack
yo jj low-key banging at squash
I’m sure they don’t mind running behind her 25:55
25:48   DAMN
My eyes hurt from watching JJ deadlift... like bruh Viks got better form than the "boxer"
Big up @NELK in the background 43:15
Wow. I did'nt know that Ethan also works as a cameraman. 36:27
?
43:03 me and the homies working out
vikk pls just get better at one sport atleast
25:49 thanks me later
Yooooooo, they should do the same video but the other way around to see who is the ultimate winners overall!!!
30:44
Part 2 = roles reversed? :D
ethan going back to be fat in no time
We’re so damn close to 10 mill
That chick on the treadmill is banging 😍
The way all the comments are about harry puts a smile on my face
I’m watching sidemen Sunday when I should be doing online school 😃⚽️
Next time I see ksi do some push-ups I expect them elbows tucked in!😂
harry's a fucken beast
16:55 such a wholesome moment
All my cod players kno this map 😂😂😎 picadally how ever it’s spelled
Why did it feel like everyone was drunk in this video 😂😂
This gave me old school Sidemen vlogs vibe  :(( I missed it
New idea 💡  All sidemen members have one week to consume 100K calories each
JJ is getting thinner mate no joke
25:50 that 🎂
25:49 thank me later
25:52 ...thank me later guys
Who's the girl at 3:10? JJ's girlfriend?
Surely a part 2 where the reverse the teams
All i have to say is 25:48 trust me on dis
No ones gonna talk about how they were in Piccadilly
Feel bad for the camera man lmao he had to follow them while jogging
look at the girl dancing in 37:35 in the left
I feel like josh was on some drugs this video :D
Simon ate Cuffcake
This video makes sense why ethan looked chubby in the more sidemen football video...
What happened to JJ's foot?
25:43 - 26:07 - Leon is on the left of the screen boys
Yes people are actually playing squash, my favourite sport
Sidemen should make a netflix show or movie
im just saying
JJ hasn’t stopped training since the fight supposedly,then there’s Harry with his farmer boy strength.Let JJ Reddit see this
clickbait
Harry could do damage in any contact sport.. what i just witnessed.
Harry is a beast - Leon even noticed. I hope he offered to train him, i reckon he'd create a monster. Beast mode 100.
Harry is a beast
Harry smashed this!!
What did callux say to ethan at last? I didnt understand?
I love when josh and Ethan are vs each other while callux vik Harry and Ksi are running to nandos
Respect to Harry he is a underrated athlete
I swear Ethan says bro like 1000 times in every video
lets be honest no was listening to what leon was saying at 25:42
Yo did anyone else see the girl in the background when they were at gymbox training? She was bad
cal's a gun at squash
anyone else's attraction to harry just triple after watching this video. sheesh lad
Simon is so cringe it’s stupid
then the roles will be switched for the next one PogU
25:50 is a good Motivation to keep running
Seeing jj wear next% to play squash angers me as a runner
This is actually a cool social experience
25:47 Background, ur welcome
Petition for both CALS to get into the sidemen? 💯 💯
Finally someone knows what squash is
Do it again but reverse the teams!
they should swap this for next week
I have just been informed that I have COVID I am sad
Does anyone know what that watch is that ksi has ?
25:50 background thank me later
why when josh zooms in on Ethan, he looks like the guy that screams gingers do have souls ???
CALLUX VERSE ME SOMETIME
That's the first time I've ever seen a big YouTube channel play squash. I used to be state champion when I played it lol
i love vikk what a g
I’m not a fan of these calorie/food videos tbh
I got a lil distracted at 25:53
They should do this again but teams are reversed
43:23 sidemen watching FullSend. Maybe a future collab👀
KSI's deadlift looked horrendous.
They put *BARE* ads on this video
Sidemen are just amazing even off cam, like legit best friend material all day long
25:50 thank me later boiiissssss😛
harrys a tank tbf
If Harry trained as hard as Jj... I can't even imagine what would come out of it..
Harry did great but look at Ksi no wonder he won his matches man puts it work that no one sees
The copy right strike is strong with this one
Austin MCbroom Vs Harry?
I was seeing JJ only IDK why
I think Harry is naturally the strongest of the Sidemen. With proper training he'd be stronger than JJ I reckon
We need callux in the sidemen
They should do a part 2 and swap places. Really want to see what happens when they are swapped.
Finally someone slapped ksi head
43:21 my guy steve will do it on the tv
47:56 guys after wanking
Harry's an absolute beast. Major potential. 💪
24:25 did cal just swear with cancer? 😂
Behz and zerkaa together are so funny😂
I think they should add Stephen tries as an actual member of the sidemen
Am i the only one who would choose to be on the loose calories team every time? I can’t possibly be the only one
7:40
I keep thinking In my mind that they gonna add another member like callux or freezy but hopefully not
Harry is actually a beast in the gym
Whats the watch they use?
26:00 BUFF TING behind Leon
Lol
25:55
I don't know but it's very entertaining seeing one part of the sidemen have fun and another one struggling
HARRY and MY Guy 💪. And much respect to JJ. And also Callie as well for trying
I love seeing JJ work like this
They should get Matt Stonie on one of these
Jesus Christ jj ur press-ups are shitters
25:45
This is the best challenge/vlog
I missed 25:50 what did he say I was distracted??
They genuinely need to do part 2 but the team must switch the task
next vid the teams are switched
34:34 Tobe got moves
Watching how close Harry holds the handles on the ergo gave me anxiety
43:09 full send babyy @nelk
Jj's push up form was poor he didn't even get close to the ground
Sidemen looking fit. JJ was fat like 1.5months ago lol, what a champ
leons voice is so much higher than i expected
I see Steve from nelk at 43:14😂😂
Harry is mad
Harry is a legend
43:23 Watching Nelk? Maybe one of the collabs they couldn't do because of Covid...???

Harry is a g, he does everything without complaining and even keeps ups with jj wgho does those workout routines quite a bit
Anybody notice how Vikk has more motivation when JJ cheering for him? Like their friendship is underrated
25:48 pree the bunda 😵
There should be a video where the two groups switch roles and btw it was a nice moment between JJ and Vik at 44:14. Really caring for each other ! Keep up the good work guys!
They should do this again and just switch the teams
25:47 , for the boys . Big bundah istg
N1CE push ups KSI LOL
36:35
vik playing sports is relatable.
This is one of my favourite for a little while from these lads, the banter is top notch
175mph Squash ball vs back is a quality video for sidemen reacts
What was the sidemen thinking when behiziga joined sidemen
Harrys actually got massive arms. Its impressive
#cupcake-19
The ultimate crossover
Petition for cal to be in the sidemen ✔️
How can Callux’s favourite sport be something he can’t pronounce...
The calories loss part was much more entertaining to watch than the calories gained
20:41 I dont think ricen is healthy, look it up 👀
any tyler fans notice the "I Aint Got Time!" sample at 7:48 ?
Ethan finally unleashing the true power of the stomach
Who knew Harry would have a good physique like Toby and vik are just skinny but got a good amount of muscle and I know Toby is trying to get bigger and ksi is just fat but lots of muscle I think if he cuts all the fat then ye maybe I’d say he’s built Callux I mean props to him for trying but yeah Um he’s just skinny fat and Simon he’s just very tall and lanky and obviously Ethan he is just built I would say
At least how I have been taught burpees are push up, up, jump, then repeat
what’s the discount code
Some tell me the discount code pls
What the discount code I didn’t see it
What’s the last discount code someone pls tell me from the Calorie challenge
25:49 look at the girl in the back on the treadmill 😍😍
Sidemen watching nelk! Collab?
What’s the discount code I missed it pls someone tell me
I only wanted to watch the burning team the other one was triggering because of the unfairness
Should've titled this video "Josh bullies Ethan for 30 minutes" 😭
they should have brought viddal into the video
Next Sunday are we expecting the same thing but switched?????
Harry's a different breed 🔥
lowkey couldn't ever workout with vik cause... bro.
14:15 your uncle in eid
we need a cheap vs expensive holiday video AGAIN!
The only thing that makes Ethan happier then his dad and women is food
This video was so fun and wholesome haha, need another!
harry built different
9:50 Dang Callux
Cmon vik just cuz ur watch didn’t work doesnt mean u didn’t do the workout
45:35 Ironman looking sus
Harry is beast
JJ's deadlift form was absolutly terrible
46:03 close your eyes and listen
Harry are so underrated tho
that was so nice of Tobi to give Ethan the iron man
Everyone’s respect for Harry went up in this one
JJ quarter repping for push ups
Harry is only Fat so he doesn't make The others look bad
Harry is only Fat so he doesn't make The others look bad
Sidemen Sunday video idea: the sidemen have 2 groups and who ever makes the most money legally wins 10,000$
26:39 YOO WATCH FOR THAT SNIPER GLARE 🤣
YAAAAAAY JJ IS TRAINING!
Big up vikk man good job in the gym vikk
Ksi
Reverse roles now
I wonder how five guys felt in there mouth
This challenge would be a lot easier in the states
One burger in the US is almost 1k calories 😂
next week should switch what each team does
I like how when the burning calorie team are working hard then it just cuts to Simon,Ethan, Josh and Tobi just playing around and muching food
Anyone notice they were watching nelk on the TV? Collab would be fire
I got way to into that car race lol
At 20:39 for a second I hought those were his chest hairs
17:30
we gonna ignore the cake at 25:47?
Ethans starting to get fat again
What the name of the outro song plz
are we not gonna ignore the fact that they were watching nelk boys at 43:11
i thought Leon was gonna have a manly deep voice, then he whipped out the pre pubescent voice
25:40 your welcome
31:10
18:22 damn ethans got a great taste in cars. I reckon josh just chose the evo cuz it looked cool
Sidemen: be struggling to get Max calories in one day (not counting Ethan and JJ)  Me an American: Eats almost 2-3k cals a meal
harry is preparing himself for a boxing match 🥴
Harry is the person that doesn't study for a test but gets 100/100
me in wii tennis 0:05
Tobi doesn't deserve to be in sidemen
Tobi was so quiet
Harry out here outperforming jj, and jj is the boxer
Wear your masks properly guys!
Vick abused in a good way by the sidemem😂😂😂😂😂😂#justiceforvickfromsidemen
All u saying jj fat stfu
we need a sidemen video where its just chill and they can do what they want and vlog in london
I love that they’re watching nelk in the background 😂😂
Sideman to 10 mil is tense ya know just a little over a month to go less that 200k off and they just got another lockdown oohhoohhh

Lol ethan is the only one i haven't seen with a mask for the whole vid
Go to 25:50 and look in the background won’t regret

Harry’s got that farm boy strength and stamina
Why is ethan always fkn angry when he eats?
They watching the nelk boys

Next video should be where they switch with the other team.
Simon u want some Gatorade
Cal is so funny with the sidemen😂

40:49 Ethan saying: ''Iehbjhwbnukn hwniybxw hbuycfbef hjwjdnuec huefbjnfe hb ienifrniubuebd jbrhj.''
Harry low key one of the most fit from the sidemen (Just because of farm strength)
min 4:00 his rein is over.

27:27 so one's gonna say that guy looks like Harry styles?
28:06 Leon got some cake 😳
Big up Harry. He did really well
Harry could get ripped no problem he's got such good form.and determination
Yooo imagine having a full burnt sienna load out
I mean right Ethan 💀
THANK GOD SOMEONE LIKES SQUASH. I LOVE SQUASH. EVERYONE SAYS FOOTBALL OR TENNIS OR SMT.
Never knew how fit Harry actually is😲😳
I'm starting to think the sideman just like eating.
27:28 is that max fosh the meal deal guy
So Harry is fit its just he is lazy
Dese calorie vids are the best type icl
Is it just me or they're doing the same thing over and over again?
I wanna see Harry box Jake Paul now.
Nelk getting featured in the background ❤️
Anyone else just look back at the channel and realise they got 10k more subscribers each day for 3 days yes ooo #
they should do this again but swap the teams
Harry Road to Strong Lewis 👀
At 43:10 they are watching nelk
28:05 leon thicc
Why did callux piss on his sweater
25:53
Harry is low-key slept on. Guys a beast
JMoney84762

My name is Leon
Fuckin shush greyhounds r better
5:29...... Me when I smoothly talk to a girl
this convinced me that harry is one of the most attractive men on the planet
Wow harry is streng af like wow ❤️😍
People veiwing this in a few years will say: Ah back in the bad Ol days with Covid 19
Callux could actually be part of the sideman
Gotta make the calorie meter JJ’s face, AKA the Fat Neek
I honestly wish Simon’s team did what Jj’s team did because Simon’s team didn’t do much and even though they won they should have seen what Jj’s team did because that was amazing.
Defo should’ve blazed before eating they would’ve munched 10k calories easy
jj is unfit fam
When will simon go to the gym in future videos? He never participate in the latest gym sidemen video.
25:40 anybody else notice that fine girl in the back👀
2 things 1) 23:16 pause and look at the still shot of tobis face LOL 2) pause and unpause as fasst as possible from the time stamp and listen to how creepy their laughs are lollll
please do sidemen impractical jokers
can we thank tobi for covering the camera when josh was spewing our his whopper.
anyone know the song at 48:41 ?
Loved seeing the vikk and jj support and teamwork
18:35 look at Josh fingers when he drive😂😂
Big ups to JJ, Harry, Vik and Callux for doing those workouts! This video was great! And the workouts were inspiring🔥
25:40 your welcome
harry is the most athletic sideman
Dude its team mask vs team no mask
37:34 peep the shawty in the back checking Harry out
JJ’s push-up form truly something to behold
Great video
25:51 I ain't lookin at the back
Harry is UNIT
Right hand side 46:51 thank me later

Stop commenting about weight.. we all have eyes and can see for ourselves.
What kind of tory game is squash
I love them so much
Big up callux
Y tf josh still got his beard didnt he  loose the bet
22:50 for the boys
Harrys arms are bigger than my life
JJ was the pacemaker  Callux has a pacemaker
isnt england on lockdown ??
Jj swing 👎
sidemen watching nelk
The Lose Calories Team Carried The Video🐺Shoutout To Leon😂
Everyone is calling JJ a fatneek until they see this video.
Who's gonna tell them it doesn't matter if they total it or average it. There are 4 people on either side smh.
All the sidemen need to do is walk  eat and exercise and fans will still watch it...
He is doing pushups the wrong way
29:38 bro that's kinda mad
Who else thought Tobi was mad quiet in this video
Bro way to many ads
No one gonna talk how they where watching NELK
44:00 Nelk boys
25:52 that must be the reason the bois kept pushing thru
is this all u do
Sidemen : calories challenge  Ethan josh tobi Simon : playing games !   😂
JJ is a beast
Next weeks sidemen Sunday should be the same things but the groups switch.
Ppl who saw simons bottle flip on tiktok
Did u all see that they were watching nelk
Whats the song in the background at 09:31
Banger vid, calux was best choice for extra, hes so funny
Anyone notice how the eating team were on the cod map place
Nobody talkin bout that thiccie at 25:59
They should do if reverse now
how Simon be swallowing JJ"s shlong  3:33
No one: Old Miniminter coming out of nowhere: 17:21
As a rower, I respect the boys’ effort. It’s a tough sport, but fr the rowing technique they were using... no wonder they found it challenging.
Harry is just an absolute unit jfc
Next vid u guys should switch it kk and them eat and Ethan and them work out
“Vik”  makes an entire transformation video about the little bit of weight he gained  “Harry” doesn’t make a video or even talk about how fit he has gotten
Yo SidemenxFullsend??! 43:10
Never new JJ was good at squash 😂
Harry has crack head energy
lol
This video demonstrates two very different ways to live your life 😂😂😂
Why TF does harry gives me the same vibes as Boris Johnson... like...
harry needa to box someeone goes he was going HARD in the gym in the end
Next video idea, doing it the other way around
does anyone know leons social media?
wtf was no one wearing there masks when they were walking in the street,and more than that  they were making jokes about covid like bruh.
This might be the first sidemen video where Ethan and jj are not in the same team
Nelk on screen
18:15  Callux: Build a house for my mum  Yo, I shed a tear ngl
What are the mask rules in the UK
the race between ethan and josh much more entertaining than simon and tobi’s
Maybe Vik should try cricket 😂🏏
HARRY IS A BEAST
what watches did they use to track their calories burned?
gymbox looks pretty lit tbh
Love how Cal legit just did a 5k in tracksuits and a sweater. Heart rate would've exceeded 300 XD
34:34 i love how tobi did it so well
Harry Built different
Vik is a bad image for all indians
vik has an unhealthy obsession with bpms
Peep the nelk boys on the tv. Sidemen x Nelk Boys collab. Biggest thing of the year.
Surely they do a part 2 where the others do exercise and Harry, Vik, KSI and callux eat
Callux is a wholesome guy
Memento Mori.
to be honest that i like ya cut g that Ethan did was the worst in the world
Harry is a crazy beast! Big Ups Harry!
The amount Ethan reminisces bro is he depressed?
1:45 lads FIND HER @
damn dude Harry can be looking rlly good if he stays fit
They have now worn their masks well😂😂.well done.
Wow lockdown in Australia is so much worse lol
GO SUBSCRIBE TO DEVIN WAITE
opposite teams later?
Smashed it gentlemen!! Loved that video
Make callux one of the sidemen he deserves it!!!
Yo aye
'The boy lay down bro'-Ethan Payne 2020
47:00
Josh vlogs yes
A KSI vs Harry video would be cool main channel video for either one of them
Watching this i just noticed how lonely i am
I mean TBH We all know Who really are the winners... JJ Harry Vik Lux
10 mill subs before the end of 2020
someone lmk what the watch is called that theyre using?
me looking at all the rubbish in the leaves 👁👄👁
Anyone know what watch their using
Not to clown KSI I've been watching him since his FIFA funnies videos but his form is kinda bad on his kettle bell swings and his dead lifts as well I feel he might hurt his back at some point
Min 23 to 26 is just zerkaa tobi behzinga na simon having good vibes
Bro why didn’t I get a noti oh well at least I’m here🥶
Camera girl looking kinda cute ngl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck9nAHK9XMs&t=579s
Am I the only one who is in shock Harry is so good, he must of recently started going to the gym and on runs
25:47 I had no attention what he said😂😂
45:23 (background)
It’s so good that the sidemen did this video for jj he’s getting bullied from his fans by calling him fat neek I love jj no homo tho
Proof Harry is athletic
ASAP Like this comment . LOL
Harry is a beast
KSI voice crack 5:18
shorty got the fatty 26:00
*I like ya cut g*
Peng
25:58 grey shorts 😀
I think ethan should be losing calories because its working out and he has put on a couple pounds again
25:49 in the background. OH DAMN
why do i kinda wish i was in the burning calories team
As soon as i saw JJs group going to the gym I knew EXACTLY why Simon is in the other group lol
Harry’s just lazy but he could be a beast
Please add Lux as the 8th more often!
Are we all ignoring the fact that callux, who basically doesnt upload, bet 1000 against 3 of the richest sidemen lmao
bro how is JJ even kinda fat- and how does he have bad form if he does this normally with leon
simon eating that cupcake is what hes gonna do to jj meat tonight
@25:40  For The Boys
Banging video lads
16:45 hehehe
Next Sidemen Sunday should be same vid just team swapped
this is kinda unfiltered and its funny af
1:19 im surprised that jj hasnt made a hole through the building
JJ: "I dont lose"
Let’s go they played squash
25:50 my eyes immediately looked somewhere else 🤣
Did anyone notice that they were watching Nelk during this thing? Lol.
whats her snap @24:00
I am glad that jj is in the calorie burning group
Watching vik workout is that funny
How is vik that unathletic
Didn’t know Cal was that good at squash should have a vid of all sidemen vs Cal he wins they have to do a forfeit he decides think it would be awesome
England stole that place from modern warfare
I dont want to seem rude but did anyone see just skip SImon's group and only watch the Fitness as it was much more enjoyable.
Is nobody talking about how the boys are watching the nelk boys in the background
25:45 that hoochie behind Leon
Prayers up to Callux
Next video: switch it up
Petition for them to make a part 2 of this but the teams are reversed
25:54 where y’all looking at 😳😭
JJs form in the training went out the wkndow
My body was aching just watching this
Switch sides and run it back boys
25:50, amen 🙏

25:52
r we not gonna talk about how they were watching nelk
Tobias jacket fire
27:24...these jihadis have stalls !
Dannmmm Harry's actually a beast man
Harry looking kinnda good
next week they should switch sides  JJ's team should eat and Simon's should workout
Tobi is actually so boring. Why is he there???????
25:45 check the background yall won't be disappointed
This video should call "KSI's training VS Logan Paul's training"
Hope ksi can catch himself before he becomes to unfit to box I love the man
It was fun watching the Burning Calories team because I saw them push boundaries... Mad respect
JJ has terrible deadlift form lmao someone needs to teach him how to properly hinge
Vikk burns more calories by playing warzone 🤨
24:38 Anyone know the song in the background?
Watch more sidemen #sidemensunday
Big up JJ for behaving the entire video
Get your merch #sidemenclothing.com
Is no one gonna talk about  the girl that’s looking at him
I think Ethan is wearing the mask upside down 🙃
Harry had better teqniuk then jj and flelt strronger and faster
For the boys the girl in the back at 25:48
can anyone direct to me tobis  red jacket what brand is it
#sidemensunday
Leon makes JJ look tiny
Who else saw them watching Steve will do it or nelk 😂💀
Why did they only eat carbs they should eat more fats if they want to eat a lot of calories so fried chicken a ribeye are all good ideas
I know they all joke about Harry’s drug use, partying, lack of sleep etc... but he’s bare hench ya know!
nobody’s gonna talk about how the guys were watching the nelk boys🔥🔥
Now its time for the other way around🔥
This man Harry looks like he professional over jj
25:47
Harry got his gym rat badge over JJ ngl
Who's ready to see fat Ethan again?
We all see the @stevewilldoit at 43:10
Im confused if this is eating 80k or burning 80k
Bruh Leo’s such a nice and down to earth guy
Tobi: bread and wine tings.. HOLD TIGHT JESUS.. lmaoooooo
Pretty sure this was Harry’s gymshark application.
43:17 Nelk boys in the background
3:52 hehe
43:10 I like how they were watching NELK lol 😂 FULL SEND BABY!!
This video made me realize Harry is stronggggg, what a legend
Look in the back round to the right  at 44:28
The girl in the background fam https://youtu.be/LgIop9jKNv8?t=2722
Rip Ironman
Harry’s gunna buy a fat bag of Charlie
Yall saw that in 45:41
Why do they care so much about heart rate it isn’t a reliable measurement.
Why is Harry good at everyy game?
the most wham rowing form
Guessing there gonna be a reverse
I love to see that the sidemen are watching ,on youtube, a video of the Nelk boys. Let’s full send it!!!!!!!!!!!
Cal should replace tobi
When jj was boxing he wasnt swinging his arms around
Sidemen vedios looks like they are on a reality show playing games
Never gonna say jj doesn't workout
Thank to callux for the feature❤️
25:48 u know dem man are looking at the girl in the back
Another one for the books.
If this is a usual day for ksi why he still chunky
The funny thing is none of those pushups counted JJ 😂
tobi getting ethan the iron man was so sweet
Jeez then deadlifts must be hurting his back with that form. JJ that is.
they really are doing ethan dirty lately
The one mistake they always make with these kind of videos is, they have large meals, what they should actually do is have small portions of food, so that they don't get full quickly.
Sidemen watching Nelk
Unpopular opinion: watching the sidemen eat is boring and disgusting
idk why but joy Ethan got from getting the iron man plush from Tobi seemed so genuine
25:22 aye yo
48:52 did they cut Callux off trying to say “Subscribe to Callux”??😂😂😂
43:35 peep the bell video
I can do it in video games not in real life -vikkstar 2020
I wanna see harry in a boxing match now after this
Why did Harry sound like Boris at 20:11
All that cake and it ain’t even my birthday 🎂 25:45
What did that old guy try to do to Ethan and the chocolate bars? I can't tell.
JJs form on the rowing machine was GARBAGE
Finally JJ will loose weight😹😹
bruh ngl that chick in the back when they were doin gym was peng 😭
These food videos always make me hungry
Whats their watch called that are tracking their calories?
25:50
Can we take a moment to realize that Tobi wore his mask in public
Can we talk about how fit Harry is
SIDEMEN TGF COLLAB PLEASE!!!!
Tobi when Simon asked “A large whopper meal” 😂
Why does jj not have an Apple Watch lmfao
is me or does Simon look like a fish 9:31
Do the same video again, but swap the teams roles.
I own a car like the one josh was racing in
Harry and JJ are beasts
I always new Harry was strong but wtf?! I've gained extra respect for him now on top of the respect I originally had.
Sidemen x Nelk boys?
Nelk boys on the tv in the back 43:00
Ethans getting fatter than jj
the Sidemen are so nice to Callux honestly, it's crazy he's accomplished something not many people have and that's have 2 make-a-wishes in his life! it's so nice he chose the Sidemen and they actually said yes!
Sidemen do a week of yoga? Flexibility
25:50 no need to thank me
Claim your ticket for being her before 10 million subs
Cardio before weightlifting is horrible 😂
Predicting right now by Christmas they will be at 10 mill in fact on the 3rd or 4th sidemen Sunday they will be at 10 mill
anybody know what watches they use to track their calories
12:39 did anyone else notice JJ in the background
It’s good that Ksi was in the losing weight team cuz the man needed it
0:00 unintentional rap
My strategy to eat would be to not think about me eating then the food would end up in my stomach XD
Harry is a beast! 🔥
dead center of the screen lads 25:48 highlight of the video
They do realise that the calorie app Is 30% accurate so if they on 1000 it could be any where between 1000 to 2000
Simon eats the cupcake in one bite he’s been practicing with J.J.
25:50 the bird in the grey tights 😍
anybody thinks that harry can beat jake paul?
Yooo they almost at 10mil
Let Harry fight Jake Paul at this point 😂
they seem more violent than normal it's scary lmao
25:43 that girl in the back is thicc LOLLOLOLOL
i thought UK locked down again or was this filmed before?
Pls tell me I’m not the only one who saw the cake @25:50 ...
JJ had the best idea - get started burning Kcal first. Eating 10000 is really easy, burning it isn't
Are we not going to talk about that bunda 25.54
43:20 - ayy the sidemen watching nelk boys
bruh does tobi ever talk
Yo Tobi is actually a sick lad tho 🙏🙌
Big Mann Harry
Everyone makes fun of KSI but he is a beast
callux ruined the video
when they run out of content
Vik: 10km n hour. Way to fast for him Me: 16km not even a problem
V
Yo vro I’m moving to the uk fam  25:47
3:38 Simon did that because of the practice from JJ
Half of the video:- Callux flexing on "Half" of the Sidemen by "Squashing" them.
Fans who are rowers are dying inside
I’m gonna just watch this after my workout lmfao
Vik just needs to stop complaining about how small he is😂😂😂😂
They are watching the Nelk boysss!!!
43:33 there just watching nelk boys i like it
25:48 😏
I feel like Ethan and Vikk Should swap places.
1:29 JJ fighting Ethan's dad part 2
ethan slacks off a bit in videos he is always on his phone now and he thinks his the big man in the group but the old ethan didnt do that stuff
Yo they were watching nelk boys on the tv
Ethan is hilarious
I like ya cut g 😂
Lol when JJ is playing squash he was wearing one of the best running shoes in the world
Only people that saw that 🍑 in the gym can like
Do another one with the teams flipped
Anyone else notice that they at 43:30 the nelk boys are on the screen. BIg up Full Send
Yo why nobody appreciating JJ man ? He did bits too.
Yooo JJ is quite agile tbf
*SUBSCRIBE!!!!!!!*
Cal is actually nice on the court.
NOOOOOO WAY THOSE CHIPS WERE 1000 CALORIES
Yo i thought UK on lockdown
JJ spoke facts at the end.
99% of the comments: harry is underrated asf!
Ill buy my own plane ticket & destroy him in racquetball.
Harry: Ethan's putting on some pounds. MoreSidemen: Shows the actually has Sidemen: Shows how he did it
Now that Ethan has put more weight on, Harry low key got the best bod in the sidemen
I thought London is in lockdown.....my mans here searching food on street without mask.....im concerned👁👄👁   P.s. I'm a girll using my fathers acc
Completely off topic but anyone who needs someone to talk to    Feel free to add me on snap I’m willing to hear y’all out @re_drew9
Do same challenge teamswap
Cal is cold
Why does vik always keeps his thumbs up when jogging?
Couldn’t finish that one bean bro
25:38 that girl is baddd🥵
43:47 bois are watching nelk lesssgooooo
Ayyyyy peep the Nelk Boys on the TV
I wonder if the taggers in London be gang banging lmao “ay mate where u from aye “
Vikk played warzone tourney for 4 hour after recording for this video. Mad respect.
Part two with teams swapped
Why are people surprised at JJ's form? The windmill mans about heart and dog not form.
ignore this comment, 21:20            12:30 AM Mon Nov 16
Instead of vikk it should have been Ethan who should have gone to the gym
43:04 the guy in the back is risking it all
I can’t believe Callux managed to slip in that fat joke at 51:15
Is anyone else suprised that Ethan didn't join the team that was working out?
“word on the street i’m a damn mammoth” lmao me too ethan
me: an american who cannot understand half the things the sidemen say  also me: i luv the dang sidemen
That's great, now both teams swap places and see whether they can regain or lose the same amount of calories as this video.
Why does vik always get the broken watch
5:44 LOL
Harrys a natural athlete, but u gotta respect Viks grind .
By seeing this i am getting old eathen vibes
The eating team let us down
jj vs ethan work out circuit
sidemen x nelk boys party eventually?
They should make part two with same teams but the other challenge and uploaded on the second channel   Like so they can see👇
VIK: and the break is? Leon: *evil laughter*
43:09 fullsend baby
Jj team should eat the Ethan team should workout
22:44 for the boys Who failed NNN look at the Background.
25:50, in the back, thank me later
someone’s singing man in the mirror by michael jackson at 25:29 and 26:10
When I tell u harry got different……or maybe he just wore a tight shirt
I wanna see a JJ vs Harry fight. Anyone else?
shout out to harry....for showing what he can really do ngl....big up my man
44:30 geez on the right 👀
If Josh got the odds goddamn it would have been hilarious
Yo harry could smash somebody in boxing with that grit and determination
AYYYYY let's go Callux Squash is the best!!! such an incredible workout.
It's cupcake-19, Josh is funny man
Harry has that pure, farmer strength. If he gets cut, he could take JJ and Logan on.
51:08
Harry’s hench!!!
Petition to add callux to the sidemen
6:30 we got a throwback to classic “Ah my shoulder Vik”
Cal should really be in the sidemen
ALL OF YOUS, LEARN TO USE AN ERG, (A ROWING MACHINE)
love how humble harry is. he was doubting earlier that he wouldn’t be able to complete the workout and he’s smashed it 🔥
JJ: Nobody is gonna do it, it's too hard.   Harry: Hold my steroids
imagine if harry trained like jj in his first fight
yo i’ve never seen jj so serious. that’s the jj nobody saw behind the scenes before the boxing match, that’s why he won
I guess jj cant say he's still bulking
josh & tobi’s laughs are actual serotonin.
I reckon this is the only 50min+ video i've ever watched without yawning.
I wanna see this but the people swap teams 😜😜 so they have a go at other things
Sidemen x Nelkboys collab Will actually Go Trending.
I loved this vid i hope u bring more guest
I beg harry does a body transformation
They was watching Nelk Boys
They should do a reverse so the eating team does the burning and the burning team does the eating to make it fair.
what they need to do now is flip the roles, and then see who wins.
How are arcades open? What😂😂
Yo Callux love ya by the way :D I would've said YES to be in a Sidemen video anyday idc wtf they make me do, I also have tons of colab ideas that would be bangers as well!
More sidemen vid  Sidemen Arcade Battle  Car race and all that stuff Simple.Easy.Amazing
screw boxing, squash is better
Harry is humble asf on his fitness, no wonder why no one knows why
25:53 peep the thick booty
anybody see them watching Nelk Boys
no 4K this time :(
JJ WEARING THE NEXT%!!!!! My fellow runners will know exactly what I'm talking about lmao  Edit: BRUH HARRY AND ETHAN ARE WEARING THEM TOO LMAO
Stevewilldoit 43:15
Am I the only one who skipped the guys eating and just watched the workout group?
ksi took an L
piccadily
43:46 they watching Nelk
Honestly Callux in the sidemen wouldn’t be such a bad idea
They are wearing Hublots smh
Ethans's catch frase : oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
For once Ethans on the best side
Honestly Callux should join the Sidemen
Calorie videos again..got any other ideas?
25:51 DAMN!! 🍑
who skipped josh,simon,ethan,tobi part? I did
Josh with the camera is like a 14 year olds snap story😂😂
Callux doesnt even know the rules of his own game, gotta hit above the second line lol
LETS GO HARRY💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
We need a sidemen play squash video now
25:50 for the boys
25:39 i know yall werent looking at leon...
They should do a sidemen minute to win it video.
43:37 they’re watching Nelk 😂
Boring vid
Harry might me the most underrated athlete around. Like seriously the dude can do all sorts of stuff. Pretty impressive.
JJ needed that workout
25:47 thank me later ;)
one team:play squash and run miles meanwhile the other: lets go to an arcade
The eating part was boring af ngl
Sidemen rly running out of ideas
Get professional eaters for the next one 1 for each team I can imagine the side men just like “this guy is unreal”
25:48 right next to leon’s shoulder 🍑
As a coxswain in rowing, seeing their rowing technique was painful haha
What do they mean when they say “give me odds” and one of them says a number? Is that a UK thing orrrr?
44:30 iykyk ahahahaha
25:50 god damn
Arms are fkn massive
Does Tobi ever contribute in the challenges??? I swear the man is just there doing nothing half the time.
We have to get 10 million subs before 2021
Should’ve done exercises in a sauna
Only Simon deserves to eat so much look at his frame 😂
Harry is actually a beast
16:47 is so wholesome
I like ya cut g
Mad how lux completely butchered the mom spaghetti line
Vik is the most underrated man of sides
What app do they use to fined out how many calories are in the food they are eating
I love it when callux is involved with this type of vid
this video motivated the hell out of me
No wonder callux is always refused for being the boring kind
39:30 tobi in this video is soooo Pissed
Can anyone list down the workout
Harry can actually be an athlete
17:5 GUYS LOOK ITS THE GUY FROM FORTNITE
5:30  i felt when vik said i can do it in a video game cant do it in real life🤣
Working out intensely. Cuts to josh eating like a baby 😂😂
As much as I love Harry JJ is a beast. He's the kind of guy whose form keeps on increasing as much as he works out. Remember Joe Weller fight ?! JJ's body was prime
Jj’s deadlift form is horrendous
Someone get Vik a new Fitbit
Before 10 mill
Do it again with reversed teams
Quiet frankly  Thought Ethan was gonna do better  Let’s just got back in time 🌎
i was watching the 70000 calorie challenge yesterday and here comes another calorie challenge
Harry is the fittest sidemen, period!
43:37 there watching Nelk boys
Ethan starting to look bigger and JJ is starting to look like his old self times are changing
Look at that bunda when Leon's in the gym getting interviewed
I enjoy watching these vids
KSI needed this the fat neek
I just had to search up Josh’s age after seeing what looked like grey hairs, only to find out he’s 28
Please don’t make videos like this we don’t like them
Already almost at 3 million only 9 hours thats a bangerrr
Shoutout the sidemen for watching Nelk 43:20
How did ethan not get the golden ticket with all those wonka bars :))  36:40
Ya didn’t see the girl in the right at 44:30 😍
im really worried about cal, hope he's doing well mentally and ofc everyone else!!
Me living in America: that breakfast would’ve been easy 😂
Watching the nelk boys I see
Is it just me or does anyone skip vik when he speaks😂
We need a Sidemen does Cricket video
Harry vs jake Paul 🙂
Who else thinks Vik and Ethan are on the wrong team lol 😆
@43:00 watching Nelk boys
it was good when vic vloged
more squash content pls
Harry needs to train more and be a boxer  It would be sick
Sidemen watching NELK
Poor callux lmao 13:42  Savage Harry 15:32  Ethan celebrated too early 16:02  Callux asks what happens if i die 17:55  Everyone is like WTF and JJ is like "this is easy" 23:42  Ethan starts assaulting everyone: 26:29  Their reaction to the second set 33:34  This is vikks video 34:21  Tobi being pressured 35:20  Vikk rage 39:53  Callux insulted Ethan 51:08  Ethans revenge 51:50
Cod map in the back
Claim before 3 mil
25:50
At least there's satisfaction that jj is training
At 4:24 did Vik say he did a Nogla? Lol
How much were they lifting
who else actually wants to try squash now that the sidemen bois played??
Yessss the boring vs the hyped sdmn
Cal NEEDS to be in every sidemen video..... Mans a content stadium
Me realizing my crush likes me  3:05
Man I would love to be friends with ethan
Can we just talk about how drippy tobi was with the iron man
The girl on the treadmill at 25:49 👀
34:33 yo Tobis moves tho
They should do the eating video again but stoned so they can’t eat more
anyone notice ethans team watching nelk didn’t know they watched them
Reverse the roles for next Sunday
I like how the Nelk boys was on the tv 😂
WHERE DID THEY GET WONKA BARS FROM??!!
Yyyyeeeessss
Bruh of course ethans on the eating team
25:39 the camera man needed an excuse to record the background, respect.
Collab with nelk I saw u watching Steve in the back
josh really does commit in these food videos, i love it
1:24 jj those push up don't count u didn't go low enough
25:37 Aiiiii I see u Kon 😂
10:47 did someone else notice Simon holding the cutlery the wrong way???
Simon just needs to not be in any sidemen videos
The song playing at the restaurant though! De La Soul-Me, Myself & I 🔥 Great video lads 💯
Viks  chest hair looks like his eyebrows at breakfast
This why rona mad poppin in the uK lmao
The last french fries saved them lol😂
It wasn't fair that Viks weight was barely lighter than JJs
vik is abt to be sooo ripped after this vid hes gonna be able to give jj that knockdown
Don’t worry guys. No matter how much weight and calories JJ loses, he’ll always be our fatneek
Harry's form is way better than JJs
Why is behzinga all of a sudden saying bro alllllll the time 😂 strange
Anyone notice that they are watching Nelk 43 min
if harry actually trained consistently he'd be so wham
vibes rate dat
25:48 thank me later
If Harry accurately tryed he could be hench
I’m sorry but JJ’s an absolute animal bro, that’s nuts 😳
Leave me as a button to say we are tired of calorie videos smh 🤦‍♀️
Anyone else seeing what I’m seeing at 25:49?
Damn shoutout to nelk 43:15
15:15 why is Ethan saying bro at the end of every sentence
I feel like it should be KSI Ethan Tobi and Harry that should be the burning calorie team. Ethan and Tobi would've keep up with KSI and harry.
i too would go for a run if my view was as nice as theirs
The only reason callux wanted to play squash was cause he finally wanted to win at something
That 🍑 at 25:45 😳
25:54
as a doctor in sedra hostpital , callux might have tachycardia ( this is when the heart beats more than the average person which is 175 when exercising ) this is is a dangerous condition and needs treatment
as a squash player that has competed in tournaments I am severely disappointed in everyone besides Callux
Dude JJ and other lads if had eaten after workout they would have easily won.....!!!
The fact that Harry is that fit without training shows how much potential he has! 💪🏼
3:06 like mohammed ali....
Harry was killing it! Next boxing match?? 🧐
The fact that the video is not full of comments talking about THAT A** at 25:39 is insane!!
Hola soy Dora
Boys I got u 25:48, u lot see what I see?
JJ’s form on the dead lifts 😭💀
16:15 . u can tell by BPM check who works out regularly . they were all jogging at the same speed but had differing BPM rate . jj's was the lowest showing that he does work out , then harry and then vik …. and then ofc callux lol.
Neeeeeed more sidemen playing arcade games. Was so entertaining
JJ claims he trains everyday but his form on the deadlift and pushup says otherwise
Harry has so much potential if he trained for the amount of time JJ did he could bring the fight to Jake easily and even put up a fight against JJ
28:04 nahhhh he ready for sum
Who else noticed them watching nelkboys
those sidemen masks look a little small don’t they?
PART 2 PLS!
2 sosiges
JJ “I box” Also JJ *cant even do a proper push-up* sad
Is that a sweat patch from Callux's belly button? 13:50
My sport is squash and i am the fourth of europe
Harry’s a beaaaast
Did anyone see that that girl (not the photographer) behind Leon when we has talking at 25:52 😱😱😱
Like for simon being a fatass
They should do a part 2 but it is the opposite
No one:  Sidemen: CaLoRiEs
Harry looking kinda peng lately ya know
Harry ❤️
woah woah wait.. Is JJ.. ACTUALLY TRAINING??
JJ loses 845 calories before waking up  hmhmmhmhmhmhmmh
Harry SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Harry is athletic!!
Harry showed JJ up in the gym
i want the free quran on 27:33
"my heart is broken" Poor cal still hasn't gotten over it bless
harry killed it this video but solid effort from everyone👏
No wonder Ethan got COVID, look at him at 12:41. Like who does that during the pandemic?
Exercise team carried
why is ethan always eating ahah, this was his chance to workout in a video -_-
FatNeek is now MediumNeek
Sorry but this is boring af
Anyone know the jumper JJ has on at 22:00 or the make of it? Looks so clean
25:50
25:47 thank me later
25:45 i was not looking at leon ngl
Hello
Next up, 100000 calories
Think they should add lux to the sidemen and make the number even
I legit think harrys the second strongest after Ethan
Who found the burning calories part far more intresting than the eating calories part lmaooooo
is no one gonna talk about the baddddy at 25:51
so now we know how ethan got his belly back..
Viks heart rate was 100 bc his heart was slowing down
im getting tired watching them workout
Can we talk abt how jj did not do 55 push ups
Cupcake 2019 😂😂😂
jj’s form on those deadlifts 🙈🙈
Does anyone know what fit bits they use?
harry’s been working bro, look at his arms
Finally jj is actually training
Bro this really hit 3 million in 10 hours that money gonna be rolling in
I feel like Harry does actually work out quite a bit, but just doesn’t feel the need to call attention to it.  A humble man. Respect!
Bro calories side is on crack
Can I just say the thumbnail for this video looks sick! Big up to the thumbnail editor!!
More Callux please
35:12 don't mind me just saving my spot
Bring back Phil!!
Big Up harry what a legend
Please make this video: sidemen vs betasquad fake employee
Did they actually lose all there ads because of the music?
They should do a part 2 where they switch roles
28:28 worst deadlift I've seen in my life lol
43:22 Steve will do it and nelk
15:07 poor kon
30:37
Yo sidemen watching the nelk boys 43:10
When vikk said “I can do that in video games but not in real life” I felt that
25:50 hmmmmmm
Honestly drama alert is the reason why I still watch YouTube @Valerya29609801
We need the same video but the teams switch positions.
Why’s nobody talking about 5:46 that was funny-
The guy eating in the thumbnail looks like white George Floyd
Simon is so annoying throwing ethans iron man like that
Harry has the potential to have a beast body tbh.
Who else wants to see sidemen swim off so that we can see vikk wipe the floor in the pool and so we can see our fat neeks covid belly
Simon should start an OnlyFans account cuz how he inhaled that cupcake 😂
21:21 is it just me or Josh really did sound like mr. Bean
It would suck to be on the food eating team while the other guys are working out and being productive
What is this man doing in the background at 43:00 ? Seems like a hard workout to me 😂
i really hope they washed that Iron Man stuffed thingy man
Dude Harry’s from is unbelievable, even though he was exhausted his form never faltered
I was actually super impressed with Harry. He not only kept up with JJ, a now certified pro boxer, but he got ahead of him. Especially since he’s mentioned in recent videos that he’s a little over weight. So I’m very proud. Sorry to sound like a Mom.
Ethan seems like such a likeable person
honestl i think a part 2 of sidemen irl among us would be a banger, but ofc they should add some more people like callux or freezy or smthin so they can have 10 players
Behzinga getting kinda fat
Bro I feel so motivated to eat and to work out after watching this
How was josh doing both challenges ?
Couldn’t imagine losing the revolutionary war LMMMAAAOOOOOOOO
Sidemen charity squash match?🧐
for a gamer, Vik's hand eye coordination is trash
wait it thought harry was in uae
wtf is squash? Mf that racquetball
So no ones going to talk about 25:50 background 😳
This is not healthy!! 😂😂
Did anyone see the Nelk YouTube on the TV? 43:35😂
I don’t want to be a Karen but I didn’t see a mask on Ethan or the exercising 4 this whole vid
Harry is actually a unit. Big ups
Simon tobi ethan and josh where watching the nelk boys at 43:36 😂
Bro Harry do be big tho
26:00 Gitl in back got some cake
Harry doesn’t need to train, he got ✨crackhead energy ✨
Boyyy 3 mill in 10 hours on a calorie video😳
Harrys form is honestly good
Josh is su a good troll with the camera
25:58 is just me or this kinda thickkk
Was it just me but did anyone else just skip to the parts with jj, Harry, vik, and callluk😂, like there challenge seemed more fun to watch
That booty tho creepin in the back
39:26
25:47 are we really ignore tht girl on treadmill?😳
I like yo cut g 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Peep Nelk in the background at 43:25
25:51 look in the back
harry looks more of a boxer than jj 😂
Why Ethan so loud
Watching harry train and all I can hear is "Good afternoon, your mum looks like......"  Wroetoshaw v Ricegum
25:21 piccadilly map on mw
Geez I just realized how difficult wrestling actually is
37:36 that girl hella thirsty 😂
26:20 their at picidilly
one group is exercising with all sorts of activities and the other is just eating and okaying arcade games
Cal was actaully rlly funny hopefully we see him again
Bro I wanna start working out like jj but I’m  broke
JJ's trainer looks like a Younger Darren Moore (Manager of Doncaster Rovers F.C)
this just feels like a day w the sidemen video
The way British people like baked beans disgusts me omgggg
this video is pretty much 2 form of suffering... one's from too much eating, one's from too much workout....
Anybody else think the sidemen should try and make a Christmas song in 24 hours again during christmas?
Harry is the hottest sidemen
Big ups the sidemen watching nelk boys mid video
They should learn from matt stonie.
Ethan not wearing a mask was so annoying for me idk why tho
Who counts beans?
Next week they should do the same video but the teams switch goals
mashallah harry is a monster
We need this video but the teams are flipped
JJ is kinda fit
Vik and fit bits don’t get along
The fact that the Five guys fries saved them
Sooooo close to 10m
Next calorie challenge could be eat 5k and lose 5k each, idek if that’s possible tho since they’d have to exercise with full stomachs
We need part 2
Ksi should be vik trainer
Total and average will. It change the result u guys r so dumb u realise average is total divided by people....
vick is pathetic
Anyone else feel bad for the camera man 😂
Sidemen The Amazing Race
nice
anyone peep ethan josh simon and tobi watching nelkboys?
I love squash
He said she was hitting on me  Ethan: well she was blind 🤷🏿‍♂️
if harry trained like JJ, i think he would be better
All I’m going to say is: Harry... 💪
rah so no one is gonna talk about the gyal in the back on the treadmill at 25:40
So can lux not exercise because of his cancer?
29:10 why does vik sounds like the pufferfish meme
🌎🌍🌍🌎🌍🌍🌎🌍🌍🌎🌍🌍🌎🌍🌍🌎🌍【🌻台灣張忠謀🌻美國比爾蓋茲🌻全球難民營🌻始作俑者🌻台灣恐怖份子🌻操控匯率🌻惡意壟斷🌻】🌎🌍🌍🌎🌍🌍🌎🌍🌍🌎🌍🌍🌎🌍🌍🌎🌍 。
Toby is the nicest friend 17:04
they should do another video where they all switch
@25:48 🎂👀
Harry’s getting wham
Dude ethans mask so loose bruh omg that ain’t do nothing to protect the virus
jj is locked in
Squash looks like such a dumb sport lol
Just saying lads but did anyone see that peach at 25:51
Sidemen Arcade Racing tournament
jj needed this
Imagine doing this with anime characters
Have a cry vik ur Fitbit was so low cuz u were to busy complaining and worrying abt the Fitbit
They should do this again and switch tasks
jj does not do birpees the right way innit
YALL BETTER SUBSCRIBE.
36:46 bezinga dad spotted
Who was that girl behind Ethan
We need lux on the sidemen channel more often. Freezy too
Good Try Callux! =)
Harry is built like a unit
Harry working is mad hot 🥵 like wtf if he did this fully everyday he would def be the way over ethan!!
25:29 YO THEY IN MODERN WARFARE
Geez Harry is a absolute unit!
I am scared ethan will get fat by all these calories challenges but pls no
not allowed to hug bro give behz a fine of 2000 calories
Great video
Now it’s say to safe why Ricecum ducked and hid from Harry when he called him out.
JJ the fat neek
If only Harry replaced Deji against Jake, They would've had a fair fight.
Harry is different like he seems good at everything, its like if he put his minds into something he can do it.
after this i want to see who would last longer is a good gym session jj or harry
Just add Lux officially tho? Make him a Sideman haha
Sidemen better get to 10 mil
Should do a Ethan vs JJ fitness challenge video both of there mentalities are insane when coming to fitness💪🏻
As a rower I was extremely shocked on how Harry’s form was pretty decent for someone who has never rowed
Josh wore the mask upside down again 😂
Harry just has that farmer strength.
Boring video didn't even watch it
JJ's pushup form was not that good as well.
JJ: Me and Leon do this all the time. Harry:  WE.
I love this style of video its like a family video LOVE IT
jj at the end of the row lmao
Harry looks so much more athletic than jj
The main thing is that cal doesn't even has a link in the bio
Our FatNeek actually is a beast when training
Team JJ is montage of sidemen changing to be sidearms
Can we start the fat Ethan memes again
JJ'S hair be looking nice uk
I’m nationally ranked in the us for squash
Jj can't deadlift
The sidemen should go Rock climbing
Another one of these vids? Eh
3:15 ksi's shoes be looking kinda fire ngl
Side men’s videos are not videos they are literal movies
25:50 someone find me the girl on the treadmills insta
Use me as the like button for poor Callux
josh is so god damn annoying
@44:32 on harry side the woman in the back im helping out the brodies😂😂😂
7:00 let’s take a minute to recognize the most athletic thing our fatneek has done in months
next video they need to reverse the roles, easy views
vikk ur wearing the watch loose and at the bottom of your wrist. they suggest wearing it like 3 fingers further up ur wrist
Harry is a focken beast lads
That's a beautiful gym 🔥
ayyye 25:47
Harry is a damn monster, jesus
What is wrong with Callux :)
I still wanna see a close up of Ethan's tattos on exactly what they r. Or does anyone know
Well I want to be The 1st MEXICAN to be on the sidemen  lol 😇🤩🙏🏻
Sidemen endurance test, harry would smash
50:05 what did Ethan say tell me from 50:05 to 50:20
He need some milk
switch roles
Tobis jacket is ugly
26:29 the boys at Piccadilly
Yo Harry is a fuckin tank
Bro Harry smashed this
I genuinely think Harry can knock out JJ with consistent training
Callux is not meant for the sidemen, he is just i dont know man he just not fit with the boys I wish he leaves sidemen he is not cool
Yeah okay Harry did amazing with form and stuff but at the end of the day JJ lost more calories, just saying.
25:48 look over his shoulder 😋
45:58 FOR THE BOYS
25:55
Harry done really well. Saw him zone out which was hot and then kept pushing. Gwan 💚
everyone knows that what JJ was doing was not pushups
I love these guys
JJ and Harry on the same team cuts the video i half only have to watch one team now
Yo Vikks tiny yet somehow he burned over 3000 calories in 6 hours. I mean yeah Harry is ripped but Vikk is pretty fit too. 🤟
Omg Leon is hug
Poor effort by the eating team to make an entertaining video, exercising crew did top notch.. just saying the facts
If Josh and Simon didn't get the Five Guys fries there would have been two calories in it!
I love seeing the sidemen eat no homo. Keep up this great content xx
Sidemen Sunday to me is a sidemen Monday lol
25:47 ur welcome
Bruv they should only have had Jj and Ethan on the cal. Intake and they wouldve won easy!
Squash is a banger of a sport btw
so no one gonna talk about the 🍑🍑 at 25:50
Ayyyy 43.24 they're watching the boiisssss
Vice versa??
No mention of Callux in the description ? Haha
Ayo harry has improved so much man.
Ngl but Ksi is the most unfit compared to the rest 🤷‍♂️🤣
let harry fight jake we will get a good disstrack which we desperately need
Man I really wanna see a "Harry’s body transformation " he really has it in him
Do yourself a favor and go to 25:48 and look over that guys shoulder. Boys your welcome
Why does Harry look so hench at the end of the day 🤷🏾‍♂️😅😂
Why does vik look like Mike from monsters inc when he does burpees
W
how many people flinch when JJ almost clash with the camera man.
Harry Simon and tobi are the only people with a shred of athletic ability in the sidemen
No way they have wonka bars
Vik is the kind of Guy who only talks with people in the gym
29:53 Josh being very meta
i like ya cut gee
Harry impressed tf outta me this video
damn harrys in great shape
Harry being that much of a beast is pretty inspiring
25:52 the camera man knew what he was focused on lol
The josh and Ethan arcade race was fuckin intense
vik stop complaining about ur stupid fit bit and go buy a new one
Damn Harry’s deadlift form is better than JJ’s
HARRY IS A BEAST
So nobody was looking at the girl at 25:50
25:49 nice view🙃
Did
Ayo were they at Piccadilly
Peng ting @25:50?
43:12 Sidemen watching NELK🇨🇦🔥
“Is it average or total” it makes no difference because there is the same number on each team 😂
JJ wearing Nike Next % running a 5k. Mad
26:40 i luv this joke they are sweet😍😍😂😂
At around 43 minutes r they watching Steve will do it to try and copy him 😂
Harry should jump in the ring like it up so they can see it
look at that back at 25:47
I thought jj only wore wired ear buds
Harry is simply built different
Harry is built differently he has so much potential! Imagine if he actually trained
I just noticed they watch full send
JJ Harry Vikk, and Callux: Being productive and burning calories  Josh: LoOk hoW zoOmED iN iT Is
25:51 she do got bunda tho
Would want to see Harry train for a boxing match, then jj and him do a few sparring sessions. It would be great. It's just harry is kinda lazy to train everyday.
What is jj's form lol
Harry is actually so much more in shape than JJ wtf
24:47 they must have been extra motivated 😏
Just me that was having trouble listen to Leon or?👀
Legit the video was fire but Callux was the worst one in the vid with all of his overreacting to everything I fuckin hate him
Ethan needs to stop saying bro he sounds autistic
Come on JJ do press ups properly
Where the tf was that watch from please
JJ lookin like a ghetto Mr.Clean
Low key Harry is a dog! I feel Harry could be a pretty good athlete, better than all the Sidemen if he really got into it. He has that body type to be an animal if he actually put his mind to it and actually cared about himself 💪🏽🤙🏽
Anyone else notice at 43:15 they were watching the Nelk boys??
Squash actually looks quite fun y'know
we love Sidemen calorie videos
Don’t think anyone’s said this but props to Callux for trying man. Big up
id honestly much rather do the exercise than the food
The sidemen watching nelk lets goo full send baby
trying to get to 15 subs. someone subscribe pls
Ngl the team that was eating was just boring And the Team that were working out was Lit as F, the tension was savage, I loved it  We don't want to see people stuff their guts, we wanna see the real Excitement, The Workout was lit man
Everyone: comments about Harry Me: just wants to know where Ethan’s coat is from
Harry was born to be an athlete
The only thing I'm not happy about is Ethan only wearing his mask sometimes. He's the one who actually had Covid.
We need the teams reversed in some of these videos
Sidemen made the right choice putting jj in the losing calorie team
Sidemen watching nelk😌
1k run (min 10km/h) 30 deadlifts 30 box jumps 400m run 20 deadlifts 20 box jumps 400m run 10 deadlifts 10 box jumps  4 minute rest  20 cals on bike 20 burpees 20 kettle bell swings (Do for 20 minutes, usually 5 reps)  Row 10 minutes (As far as possible)  Enjoy
JJs form on the pulley thing was awful. he was only going like halfway, when everyone else was fully committing
Give some respect to Harry 100%
The fact if my comment gets less likes than these fake robot comments will make me mad
25:22 behind leon
Lelelele new hashtag #guernseyfarmerstrenght
_please_ tell me that's viks microphone...
5:44 that edit is incredible
Why tf JJ stop at 56??
Tobi's protectiveness over the iron man plushie is the best part of the video
44:30 right side, trust.
26:07 that girl on the treadmill thicc
With that 1 grand Harry won he could buy himself a new TV to replace the one he broke a few years ago getting Ronaldo
This is the first time I seen Josh hair is going gray so much.
Good job callix
Harry vs jj, I think with the right training... Harry could take jj
"no more eating videos"
Jj’s deadlift form is making me wanna throw up tbh😂
25:48 thank me later
Can’t just be me that dosent like Callux
25:50 ngl that gal in bg got a nice back
39:48  Callux is single and ready to mingle.
✨Ayy to be fair workout team was close to 16,000~! So that's incredible! I love watching these videos cause they always have a blast✨. Be well and safe everyone. 😌🖤♥
Switch the teams in another video
25:50 girl in the background🥵🥵
F*ck me Harry your form is too much dark horse. 😅😅
Harry and JJ have similar builds Harry could be a hoss if he weight lifted consistently
Ads are ok. Buffering is ok. But when ads buffer. i suffer
JJ is amazing at everything brooo BE WAS A BEAST AT SQASH
Like for Sidemen Tries ASMR
y’all kinda slacked on this vid lmao, the people who had to eat had only like 3k
People need to realise just because your fit doesn’t mean your good at boxing. 😂 boxing is a fighting technique not a fitness game.
@25:45 thank me later
44:30 on the right of Harry
25:50 DAYUM look background hehe
oi long hair ethan yeah
A
Nelk in the background
I’d love to have Leon as my pt
I’d love to have Leon as my pt
I like your cut G :))
Cal destroys JJ at squash  JJ: What your monthly listeners ?
Sidemen watch nelk
Why is Vik moaning @46:02
ID on ethans puffer jacket?
Sidemen Sunday: getting Harry henched
Why tho?
why they got viki losing weight when this man needs to get his weight up lool
25:51 , jj definitely having a geez
Cals make a wish and they do him like that
Why does JJ have one sock on and one off
lol vik is fuckin useless hahahahaahah
Harry should workout he will be great
37:12 song someone please???
The teams should switch challenges
Isn't England in lockdown right now?
Harry preparing for his Jake Paul fight😏🔥
YES. we needed another calorie challnage that’s more challanging
they have to do it again but harry jj and vik and calux have to eat and other train
NO WAY JJ PLAYS SQUASH BEST SPORT EVER
43:34 Sidemen are Nelk fans.
Why does jj wear legings?
Why does jj were stalkings?
Can we talk about how hot harry looks in this entire video
It’s not a sidemen fitness video without Vik complaining about his Fitbit
JJ SHREDING SEASOB
Anyone know the girl on the treadmill at 26:01 asking for a friend
As a rower, watching their technique was very funny
Harry built different, was born strong
We need a sidemen ninja warrior
This challenge was so unfair loool the eating team weren’t even trying at all.
20:57 whats tht coming out of vik shirt my guy
Aint no one talking about the nelk boyz in the background😂
Guys whats the name of the watch they are using which counts the burned cals
Vik: "I can do it in a video game but not in real life" Me: Not everything is a video game vik.
Tobi was very boring this video 🙄
That "hold tight jesus" got me 😂
25:55
All that food making me hungry
7:16 "In a world... where four men in black were designed to take out the leaders... We head to the FIB building." Shoutout to all the OGs who got that GTA reference
Should of switched via for Ethan cause Ethan would be so hyped and the competition  between ju and Ethan would be good
Big ups to Harry, beast in the gym
Whos the girl in the back 25:50 .....HOLY CAKES
I've broken somebody's teeth playing basketball
I got those same kettle bells they were using on the swings, I can say I swing more than JJ now 👀
1:48 blue sweater uhhhh ig?
How is it that they put all of the boring people in one group.
25:47 thanks leon,       not all heroes wear capes XD
bro i can do more push-ups than KSI and he is a boxer let's go
Callux as the 8th sidemen is awesome. They have to make him join them
5:46 is cursed
Everyone’s talking about Harry. But can we see how fit vik is too
Why didn’t u put visitar in the eat 8000 calories. You’d be doing him a favor
Sidemen r built different.
I think we're gonna see the transformation of Harry after this video
Simon is so annoying whenever he’s competitive I stg
JJ's form on the deadlifts was awful while Harry's was actually textbook.
Does anyone actually enjoy these videos? Seems a bit lazy now. They’ve done this idea multiple times now and would rather see then do something original rather then eat and play squash lol.
I was so invested in that car arcade race.
Is that... piccadely from mw?
The cake at the gym tho
Jj really hast to learn from vik and fix his deadlift hahaha
Them hands gonna beat jake jj?
hi
swear harry looked swole asf
Steve will do it in the background
Harry is a CHAD
25:50 👀
Harry has surprised everyone on this vid he’s got mad strength🤭🤭 it’s defo all that ket n whatever drugs he’s on😂😂😂😂
Tobi's so thoughtful, he won the Iron Man yet he gave it to ethan who wanted to win that earlier.
The girl in the gym😍😍
bruh he was sveting out of his belybutten
JJ: Nobody is gonna do it, its too hard. Harry: hold my Ket
Are we not going to talk abt the girl in 25:50 she’s got bunda
That camera man burnt the most calories 😂
That’s it petition to make Harry train and fight Jake paul
25:52 the view that the boys have is amazing for running
Any team Simon is on is dead bruv
Tobi= no content
Imagine if Harry gets super fit
The reason harry could beat jake paul easily than jj is because he is smartly working it out while jj is hardly doing it
JJ who apparently “trains everyday still” is soooo u fit compared to Harry who doesn’t even work out 😂😂😂 jj is such a joke
Harry slayed that
Harry is pretty smart minded
Loved this lmao XD 😂😂😂
52:08 😂😂😂
I’m getting heartburn from just watching this
51:59 😂😂😂
25:52
51:50 😂😂😂
Our Fat neek is Turning into a Monster Again Le goooo JJ in this video
51:31 😂😂😂
51:17 😂😂😂
Sidemen need to do a tattoo pain roulette challenge
Blue jumper chick at the start
Yo harry tho did really well
I love how they switch up the eating. They could so easily just eat 10 Pringles cans
25:39
Nice to see JJ doing some mad tings in the mornin
I love JJ man but why does he shadow box like he’d actually fight like that in a real fight? 😂 Might as well refine his windmill skills
25:40 camera women kinda cute
Callux should be in the sidemen for surviving
They are slacking there was a wing stop behind them
JOSH GOING HARD IN THE ARCADE RACING!
Such a wise man, can’t believe I can’t remember a single word  25:45
"Harry get the farmer strength" -Vik
My eyes have never been so blessed with watching Harry in this vid🥺🥺🥺
Harry could have one shoted logan. Jj took too long to win just by split decision
POV Ksi started doing press ups then cuts after counting 10 then jumps to 50
Does Ethan’s vocabulary extend beyond ‘bruh’ and ‘bro?’
jj hair is flourishing
Is it me or is this challenge a bit unfair LOL. Pretty sure gaining calories is like 1000 times easier than burning.
Who all saw football video before it got deleted?
🎵👀
43:19 😂😂😂
Well what happened to the football video?
25:50
People underestimate Harry but this proves them all wrong he is amazing
25:48
toby winning the iron man plushy for ethan is true friendship
u guys should switch roles next time
Bro, did anyone else hate how JJ and Harry had on Vaporfly’s and they don’t run competitively
36:46 where he go
44:29 thank me later
25:08 that bunda thoooo
who else thinks callux should a part of the sidemen?
40:18 😂😂😂
Anyone else checking out that birds arse on that treadmill when Leon was banging on about jj proving himself or something.
39:49 😂😂😂
simon, bez and tobi voice is like having little bit helium 😀
If harry train to become boxer he could have a chance against jake and ksi
peep nelk in the background
Nah nah nah nah, Harry took that dub from Lux fair and square should’ve gave him the band
25:48 ooft bunda
Toothless JJ would be hilarious !
I see a nelk video in the background 👀
I nearly was sick just watching Leon's circuit
bro look at harrys biceps this man a different breed
Harry is in better shape than JJ, no cap
Idk why people are so shocked of Harry. He has been playing football since young while most of these guys were mostly gaming
Put mask on talking about josh ,Ethan ,Simon and Tobi !
Sidemen should copy Chrismd again and do a joke contest
34:37 Tobi killed that
I wanna see Harry vs. Jake Paul
Damn Simon's hairline is lowkey receding.
Harry has come a long way since his days of throwing chairs at TVs
Ethan, Tobi, Josh and Simon were watching NELK in the background
i never knew what squash was until now😂😂
Harry could easily become the most ripped sidemen
Anyone else see the NELK boys on the tv screen? 👍🏻
Ksi vs Harry August 25th 2021
Harry's a beast fam Harry's a beast
Who wants to see Harry in a boxing fight
Actually can't stand callux
Harry is on it
I need Harry's Spotify Playlist
37:36 anyone else notice that girl checking Harry out
SQUASH!!!! YAY
They should do this again but with the roles reversed and invite Callux back
Ethan fix your mask !
25:50
Anyone else notice they watching nelk boys on the tv. Fullsend baby!
Anyone else smile seeing to tobi win the iron man for ethan then give it to him
36:48 "London Bridge is falling down" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
They should do this again but swap the teams around and see how they’ go
Whys everyone want harry to knock out Jake Paul in the comments, no trust in JJ I see
where tf are yall mask when yall went out
Harry vs Joe Weller  Like so he can see this💫
Someone find me the girl at 26:07 plz
The girl at 25.45 👀👀
🔥❤️
Damn Harry is a machine in this video, JJ has pace and keeps it up but Harry just keeps his posture during the whole time, amazing
Vik the millionaire with a cheap watch get yourself a Apple Watch then maybe your bpm will appear
Sidemen watch NELK!!! Mad respect on them
This vid felt like the old days and I'm all for it. The casual vlog vibes.
Can’t help but notice JJs half chub while doing jumping jacks
new idea "im a sideman get me out of here" just there version of "im a celebrity get me out of here" but have chunks and Niko as the hosts.
Y’all should do a part 2 where u switch and each team does the opposite and tries to beat the first teams score from this vid
Listening to Josh laugh when he’s all zoomed in made my day
25:35 awwww Tobi sounds so sad 🥺🥺🥺
Petition for the sidemen to play squash vs professionals for s sidemen Sunday
i reckon i can do good on any of the teams :)
JJ didn't even have deadlift form from the start. Harry is built different
Harrys literally the 🐐. If he were to apply himself he could be the strongest sidemen, the most subscribed sidemen, and better at squash than callux.
Reverse it bet u they won’t make the same only Ethan
they were all wasting their time running and playing squash, they should’ve just went the arcade and played Dance Dance Revolution 😂
Am I the only one that just realised that josh is near to the same height as Simon 😂.
What watch are they using here
Harry is actually a beast!
Girl in the back checking out harry in gym
Do this but the revers now
Yes more food related channels when I'm Hungry
If Harry pulls a Ethan that could be huge for the sidemen and possibly get KSI back in shape because he doesn’t train as hard as he claims so when it’s time to fight jake, jake’s gonna drop him 😬
Real talk tho where the boys looking at on minute 26 👀🍑
Viks stuff is always broken
0:57 vik's wall is cleannnnn. what a flex.
44:20 KSI motivating vik is some wholesome content
My powers out
Can we all just admit that harry is a beast now. Everyone please encourage him to be on the next boxing fights
The Sidemen have taken the whole YouTube group thing to a whole new level. 10M subs so close 👍
Do a part two but the roles are switched
the fullsend video in the back lol
Leon looks so chill to train with
The chick in the back of the gym 🤭
25:48 FOR THE BOYYYYYYYYYYSss🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
25:45 back tho
19:35 🥺🥺🥺
Just imagine Harry doesnt even train and he kept up with JJ and maybe even did better! That says alot about them both
43:34 damnn the sidelads are watchin some NELK
Why is Ethan so disrespectful 😂😂😂😂 50:10
Who knew Harry was a beast
Why isn't Ethan wearing a mask in the beginning so far
Damn harry built
The sidemen are getting old
why does eating team seem drunk during the whole video lmao
Lets go harrryyyyyyy
Harry kinda yoked since when he is becoming a big boy
They need to reverse the teams for next Sunday
It’s always jokes when they meet up at the end of a video
Harry and JJ have gained weight and Vikk is on warzone all day, so it made sense for them to be burning the calories LMAO
Harry's goated
17:27 😂😂😂
9:49 Callux is the first person to make JJ look like a beta
I love how Simon says “A large whopper meal” and Tobi just goes “yeah”
Harry is the White akenfenwa
17:00 awww I love Tobi man
I've burned 16 thousand calories by my self in one day
43:08 bruh why are they watching NELK?😂
Nobody in the comments talkinh about the arse on that bird in the gym
Josh is a massive mindup merchant lol
Ethan is defo putting that timber back on. Might be bulking though.
The rowing forms hurt my sole..
Big up the editor or editors ( I’m guessing) the editing is top class!
I know JJ’s back was killing him after those deadlifts
For how skinny Simon is, that dude can eat a lot. Good job.
13:48 😂😂😂
Is it only me but it irritates me so much how eating the calories they didn’t even try smh
Harry looking like a bit of a athlete ngl👀
Wow, was not expecting that, but Harry did reps way better than jj. Jj half assed everything while trying to show off. Mad props to Harry.
boys minute 25:45 thank me later
Harry did a madness this video. Big respect
25:45 was the best part
Paprika pringles SLAP
Let me guess after this 90,000 calories 100,000 calories
Ksi form on everything is busted like his face after fights
99% of the comments: harry is underrated asf!
25:45
Please collab with nelk
Their replacement should have been Con. Josh has lost weight, Ethans Lost Weight and gotten stronger, NOW CONS TURN
The girl is thicc in the gym u know             Ksi
43:12 Ahhh Nelk in the background
My timestamp 20:00
Tbh the first group was boring the second i realy enyojed heh
*Training videos are way better than watching y’all eat* 😂😂
Anyone else see the girl on the treadmill behind leon?
This video motivates me both gain and lose weight
NOW THIS IS A SIDEMEN SUNDAY. Like if these types of vids are your favorites
We not gonna talk bout the green Royal Mail van wtf
25:50 what colour was the pillar
anyone knows what jacket ethan is wearing ?
43:20 sidemen watching NELK boys
Wee bit of nelk on in the back grounds Simon
Spot @Nelk at 43:35
Without the addition of the fries at the end it was only a difference of 32. Wow bro lmao
Ethan looking mad fat
I’m so jealous of how many Wonka bars they have. I’ve always wanted one😭
is the camara man a girl? cause i swear either way the camera guy is taller than jj
Nice
I love JJ but his deadlifts look awful😂
They could do a sidemen reads your comments! It’s not a good idea but
NELK cameo at 43:15
I respect JJ, Vik, Callux, and Harry Respect
So because Harry did well in the gym it means he should take up boxing wtf🤣🤣🤣 what sense does that make just because he going hard in the gym don’t mean he should just box
36:48
The girl on the treadmill at 25:50.
Anyone else notice stevewilldoit in the back
Bruh that girl  at 25:49
Anyone know what watches they were using
BRUV
Why Does JJ’s Trainer Look Like Sol Campbell
Tobi did nothing he actually annoyed me ngl 🤣
43:10- we need that sidemenXNELK collab
It’s good to see that that fat neek is finally burning some calories
Eathan's cheat day😂😂😂
They need to do this but swap the eating n calories burned n compare them..
Tobi winning the Iron Man for Ethan was so wholesome
Wanna see this again but the other way around so Jj, Harry, vik and cal eat.
Leon is so underrated
25:47 not rude or anything but that girl in backround
34:38 What shop is that?!?!? I’ve been looking for Wonka bars all my life and people told me they weren’t real. Wtf I need that in my life
Now round 2: the two teams switch switch
"Oh cancer this is so fast!" - Callux 2020
Ethan on the eating team?! 2016 back he’s already put on 80000 calories man come on lockdown give him a rest
Simons so strange
harry=skrong
20:58 I thought that the mike was chest hair
Ethan is Chilling Without mask because he already had his fair share of Corona Already 😂😂😂😂
JJ’s deadlift form is cheeks
25:49 that girl in the back on the running machine has got bundah !!!!
Is it just me or i think ethan is kinda getting fat again
love that sidemen are including others in their vids
AND the next day they switch
25:48 enjoy
25:50
JJ and Harry should actually be work out buddies or some. They were going at a similar pace during the work outs, and going back like 2 years ago Harry was going to box Ricegum....
we should make @ 4:36 a trend copy and paste me  "cupcake-19"
Harry’s wham yk mad respect for him
Harry is a beast
Respect to Tobi for always wearing his mask in public
Respect that they were watching NELK boys
SUBCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL, IM TRYING TO MAKE A GAMING CHANNEL BUT DONT GOT THE PRODUCTS AND TOO BROKE , HELP ME OUT PLEASE😿👏🏽
I swear toby getting more and more useless and annoying in these videos.
37:35 look at the girl in the back
Sidemen watching NELK 👀👀
I love how Harry wrote a dis track on JJ about how he was fat and stuff but now JJ is fit, how the tables have turned. Ps. Harry could be the sexiest sideman if he worked out
Who else feels fat asf after watching these
Vikk, bro what is that lol 13:38
This is why they are called Sidemen and not Squashmen
What's up with the half arsed Burpees gotta jump at the end.
Gaining calories is so much easier😂
Good job vik !
25:45 👀😏
45:16  That cut between teams was immaculate😭
Seems like Harry really enjoyed this ngl
If Vik put as much effort in to working out as he did moaning, he may have done alright.
We love these videos!!!!🙏
fat ethan is back ahahahah  just kidding btw
1:16 Wow!!! With that form JJ managed to make 0 reps!!
Josh doesn't realise that average tells u the total. The teams are evenly numbered
26:00 . Thank me later bogs
Simon. Its not covid. ITS CUPCAKE. DEAR GOD
Hope for more of the cooking videos for Christmas
2:58 dammm!!!!!!😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
Harry defo banged a 1er bag b4 this video 😂😂
I watched this video while exercising at home. I was joining the losing calories team lol
I would want leon to be my trainer
After lockdown they should reverse it with Tobi, Ethan, Simon and Josh doing losing calories and Vik, JJ, Harry and Lux gaining calories   Like for them to see
what shoes does ethan have in this video?
11:43 says the guy that's flopping all over the place
Harry’s got that endurance
nobody gonna talk about the girl in the background at 45:20
Harry please start boxing, he wouldnt go down
do the same but roles reversed
37:38 Harry getting checked out by the ladies behind him
Like for rematch but switch sides
JJ sponsored by Nike (Vaporly)
37:39 i see u harry
Funny that Ethan thought that their win was impressive but how close that was was alot more impressive for the losing calorie team.
25:50 No one was listening to Lyon there. We were all a bit distracted👀😭
Gotta switch the roles for next Sunday
Sidemen watching the nelk boys while full sending
Awww, Tobi getting Iron Man for Ethan was actually so cute. Love Tobi ❤️
Get kallix in should be a full member of the side men
I’m really confused to how they are going out, I thought England was in lockdown again? Did they come out of it? Don’t get me wrong tho I love the fact they can make these videos again
1:28 jj fighting ethans dad
25:51, ur welcome
Claw machines are a joke, they should be illegal.
We need Callux to be in the Sidemen team. It's going to be good. Like my comment guys so the sidemen can see it.
I thought England was under lockdown yet they’re going to restaurants and playing indoor sports
Anyone know where Ethan got that coat from?
I now have a severe crush on callux
Jjs back must be in pieces after that form 😂😂
JJ: nobody’s gonna do it. It’s too hard. Harry: hold my Chelsea jersey
jj needs to work on his deadlift form, jesus
31:04
27:47 #justicforCal
everyone : harry's getting fat harry : hold my beer
Me: hungry at 2am. Sidemen: EATING VIDEOOO!!!
What Fitbit are they using in this
28:29 what is that form?😂
46:49 look to the right and of the screen.... lmao
Come up with new ideas plz!!!!!
46:01 look on the right of ur screen
Harry looked like the only one with proper form in all the exercises excluding running cause everyone was fine there.
no one else talking about 26:00
I despise Ethan
shoutout to tobi for wearing mask all the time.
they should do a part 2 but the teams get swapped
cute camera girl uwu
Why’s tobi so grumpy
25:28 Call of duty players: wait something looks familiar
Someone wanna tell vik that there’s a Heart rate lag
Everyone talking bout Harry but y is cal so sick at squash
I love ALL the sidemen. But it’s triggering how Ethan and Josh aren’t wearing their masks in public.
25:50 the bunda tho
Wow Harry I am impressed. Maybe he should fight Logan too lmao
Gosh wonder how much vik weights now lol
Tobi is such a good person he sacrificed his iron man to give to his friend
That race between josh and Ethan was intense😂
43:08 u can see steve will do it and the @nelkboys
Pokémon go first to catch a legendary Pokémon??
JJ can't even do a burpee right this is sad
Harry preform better then who said it was easy for em
Why does Ethan say bro like he’s an Australian
Did they put a discount code in this video or am I crazy
#JJ is a fat neek
Petition for behzinga to stop saying bro
harry was working mad hard this vid n jesus if that’s how he normally works out it would explain how massive he is DAMN he has to be the most muscular sideman now ffs
25:47 iykyk
25:45 the girl behind Leon tho...
Can we just talk about how nice leon is
Go at 43:45 there watching nelk. Sidemen and nelk should do a collab video. LIKE SO THEY SEE THIS.
25:50 brooooooooooooooooooo
anyone else confused to why in a calories battle Toby, Ethan, Josh and Simon went to an arcade? lol
Groove is in the heart in the cafe tho
I always liked Harry more than the others, this is why. My guy the underdog fr
do another pub video but different sport
JJs form😐😐😐
Callux is better than calfreezy change my mind
25:37 ! That bootay dammm 🔥🥵
They should switch roles for the next video!!!
Don’t get sniped from that window someone’s always camping there
I have covid 19 :)
39:55 1.heavy breathing 2.more breath for screaming or general talking
That natural Guernsey farmer boy strength from Harry though 🤝
Dude all this time we look at Harry like the guy that doesnt give a damn, always eating and driking, but DAMN! Physical and mental strenght my MAN!
I would whip them at Squash big time ahaha 😂, They are shocking!
anyone know what gym that is?
This is mad funny
Isn’t jj and that suppose to be doing the exact opposite?
love lux for doing this
I feel like the 'lose calorie team' should get an extra 5k as its so much harder to lose calories than eat them
Didn't know Harry's been bulking lately....
Imagine a SideMen Discord Server
What are y’all’s fitbits? They seem really good quality.
Love thisssss love the sidemen and lux
Do they not understand that higher total means a higher average???
The title should say ‘Vikstar reviews the new Fitbit watch and complains constantly about him BPM’ 😂😂
Haroldino is an absolute unit
Five guys fries actually clutched it
so close to 10 mill !!! lets gooo
Jj’s form is awful
25:50🍑Damn son, god blessd us
Tobi dancing in the back 34:34
That laugh from harry though
Sorry but what is with jjs trainers
25:50 god damn that girl at the back
do a part 2 pleaseeeee, switch the sides
ayo 44:27 right side
Harry got way better pull up form than JJ
14:08  Wait isn't that Dreamcatcher Good Night or am I crazy
I think the sidemen may have a eating problem!
JJ can't do full pushups or a proper deadlift with proper form
9:49 someone make this a meme
so no one is gonna talk about them watching the nelk boys
25:51 jheeeeez the BHUNDAAA
45:41  That girl im the back right be packing cake 🤣🤣
yk, a mask isn't required outdoors?
Josh must have bunned a zoot before they went burger king😂😂😂
Who saw the sweet one behind Leon at 25:50
who was the baddie on 1:47
Omg I love squash
The Fitbits always seem like they hate Vikk 🤣
Everyone in the comments rn omg the sidemen are breaking the COVID-19 rules
Callux looking like that one PE teacher no one likes
Can we just talk about this lockdown is totally upside down
for the next video, simon and team should do the burning calories session, Ksi and team should do the eating calories session 🤭
25:49 fat bunda for the boys
Only here for the squash game
harrys ping pong skills comin in handy
ngl JJ just looks in his element here
Do it again but swap the teams?
Nocco harry?
Harry really put in work for this video💪🏼
there’s a video in ur ads
Callux got more boring
16:44 we know callux we know
46:00 😉
humans could jump a lot higher than that Vik lol, even being short I out-jump my taller mate
When toby started passing out money in the arcade it reminded me when I went to the arcade in L.A
Can we get a new sideman Sunday hour long football challenge video!!
Harry tho
Ethan ru trying to gain weight
43:25 they watching nelk lol
Harry deserve the most respect. He’s a whole unit
25:50 to see some bunda
44:13 Love how supportive JJ is of Vik, true friendship right there
I need 200 subs by Friday or I quit please sub
Video idea: Sidemen Go To Dubai
Anyone notice Simon n that we’re watching nelk lol
Callux did so well in this video, felt genuinely proud watching him ahaha! Didn’t realise someone could look as good as Harry in the gym.
JJ's group running around burning a lot of calories. The camera man: 👁👄👁💦
I respect Harry man
Why did I feel sick when they were eating the wonka bars
Plz more 20 women vs 1 sidemen
Girl in the back at 26:00 👀
41:10 whoos that in the kitchen
Now that's a Arse :D
25:53😩
Yooo where is that arcade? They got Dreamcatcher good night playing in the back😆 14:06
Y'all are really trying to make Ethan fat again
we not going to talk about them deadlifts
Why am i not surprised the oldest person in the sidemen circle plays squash.     Also sidemen squash tournament
The bunda in the background at 25:50
Did anyone realized they were watching Stevewilldoit and NELK boys on the tv😂
i lost 20000 in 3 hours but ok
25:47 at least the boys had some motivation in front of them for the treadmill run haha.
Sidemen i have a video idea. U Wanted a cook off with Gordon ramsay. Why dont u do Cook off with phil? Phil is more Gordon ramsay than Gordon Ramsay himself
25:56 check the bunda
Josh zooming in on Simon and Ethan made the video for me hahahah
I think I speak for all the ladies when I say Harry is looking like a SNACK when he’s deadlifting 💀💀
But why was Harry's form so good in all the circuits they did
I skipped the eating parts , jj and the others were more entertaining
Simon needs to be put down he’s so cringe
Anyone know what that work out is good for and if so detailed info on the workout?
Is anyone else bothered when ethan doesnt have his mask fully over his nose?
Good to see KSI start the video off with 22.5 pushups
Boys head to 25:49 and thank me later
Yo Harry picked up on how to play squash quick, he even picked up Cals position a the T. Smart lad
47:00 that girl in the back looks like a simpson
Props to Leon
Yo, Ethan be looking kinda thicc recently 😏😵☺☺😄😄😲.
25:48 look in the back
So happy they played squash. Luv that❤️
Vik really didn't help jj much on that rowing race tbh. Still mad respect to harry for going that hard.
Jheeze sidemen watching nelk boys at 43:00
Harry has the farmer boy strength
Harry is done with his brother lifting more than him. He is turning into a beast.
Is Harry gets buff it's over mate
43:15 wen the sidemen watch full send
Harry is a machine my god beast mode imagine him doing boxing 😂😂
2million views in 8 hours damn these lot r killing it
I mean i know Tobi reps United, but never  put disrespect on Pool!❤️🤍
0:52
43:36 there watching nelk
Harry is matching JJ
What is the name of the song at 7:50 haven't heard it in years
25:49 that bunda in the back 👀
Ethan should be in the sports team. hes getting fat again!!!
Holy midrolls
Simon was good in this video
25:50 the girl in the back on the treadmill got a 3000 calorie cake on her
Tobi won the iron man for ethan 😄
Why is ethan on the eating team Would have loved to see ethan and ksi taking each other on
41:09 I see Luke from TGFbro
When are the sidemen doing the next strength test
They should do this again but swap the teams to be fair.
Where tf did the 80,000 calories come from 😂
Jj is acctully really good at squash like tbh
anybody know what type of watch there wearing
Harry could defo do a YouTuber boxing fight
Jj didn’t do 1 proper cattle bell swing
KSI is a frickin beast man
THEY WERE WATCHING FULL SEND YEEE
Sidemen on a sugar rush😂😂
Damn I’m 12 and can do more push ups than jj
Harry should do boxing
lmao KSI does this "everyday" but his form compared to Harry's is laughable
I never thought I'd watch about 10 minutes of squash
JJ: all the calories combined = his forehead 😂😂
All these ads bro I’m a stop watching the sidemen after all these years it’s frustrating
Switch the teams and buy callux the foldt
I would to see this the other way around Harry’s team eats as many as possible
Ethan is still fat
Next video should be a gym video
28:07 Leon got cake
miniminter
Food videos are boring
The fact that Harry is that fit without training shows how much potential he has! 💪🏼
42:09 Tobi looks so cute there idk y
Ayy
Aye get these men to 10m!!! Lessgo
25:40 Wait what did he say I was focused on something else
Who else just watched harry, jj, vikk and lux
Round back on that deadlift ouch :x
NOw am motived to workout
Josh lost the plot
okay but Simon's eyes when Josh zoomed in like wow
Josh in public videos is the best
callux wearing trackies and a sweatshirt in the gym gives me anxiety
harrys a fkin beast
Tell me someone else noticed the Bhunda on the treadmill?
Can someone reply with the full Workout Leon gave them??
The transition on Ksi taking pushups from 8 to 84 was sick
That girl in the gym had bundha 😂
Imagine Ethan went back to being fat
Y'all smashed it
Ethan’s mask sliding down all the time was so annoying to me
Getting fat is way easier than losing weight
25:48 in the back 🤯
This feels like a retro sidemen vid
Harry is hella strong damn
Sidemen should do a charity rugby match
Do this again but switch the teams
team bad audio
26:54 good to see our FatNeek back in the gym.
Bro I didnt know Harry was like that
47:13 people at the gym wondering why they so damn loud lmao
9.84 mil, so close..
damn y'all really like ads huh?
Is no one gonna talk about how simon ate that cupcake in ONE BITE
Watching Harry do deadlifts is my new religion
25:51 whats on that right shoulder, thank me later lads.
Tobi is lovin that iron man
The amount of ads on this video is outrageous
Where is 10Mil 4 da end of the year
Lmaooooo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 in 43:09 in the background tv they were watching the nelks
Simons team: competing with JJs team. JJs team:competing with each other
25:55 Who is here for the booty ?
26:02 the camera man knows exactly what he’s doing 👀
not to be horrible but what’s wrong w lux?
9:30 anyone else hear the bucketheadnation intro?
Harry has that farmer strength
Sidemen should race with race cars in real life
Does Harry go gym much? The lad looks like he goes all the time.
Its funny how the boys want fat Ethan back, they always have him on the eating team.
25:50 thank me later lads
25:50 thank me later
ayo harry lowkey a animal in the gym. Like he looked as good as JJ
i see the nelk boys on the TV 👀
25:50 the cake thank me later 👍🏼
24:25 zij hij nou k*nker
Looking at this video leaves no doubt as to how Ethan got the virus.
harry did boxing training for a while too to fight ricegum
who’s thinks they should all do an army training day and do what the army would do in training
If Harry would workout more, he’s easily the strongest sidemen
WE WANT CALLUX TO BE IN THE SIDEMEN
Josh behind the camera is laughs 😂😂
Ngl them doing treadmills made me get a cramp on my calves
I be burning 6k calories in an 8 hour shift at walmart man. Add me to this competition 😂
Nobody: Callux: sweats from only his belly button
Harrys portrayed as not as fit as anyone else but he proved everyone wrong in this video
1k run 30 deadlifts 30 box jumps  400m run 20 deadlifts 20 boxjumps 400m run 10 deadlifts  10 boxjumps  4 minute rest   20 calories on bike 20 burpees 20 kettle bell swings  20 mins constant  Your welcome
Would love to see Callum join the sidemen
Could be the worst form on the erg that I have ever seen.
Ethan looks so fried

JJ needs more sleep like 6 hours ain’t enough
I feel like Vic should just sprint jump #minecraft gang
4:35 first joke from josh i laughed at ever
Harry's rowing technique was kinda decent
I see the comments saying Harry could beat jj in a match. Harry might have natural talent but jj has drive and that is so much more important in the long run.
Callum is funny they need him in more videos
who thinks they should do a part 2 but they switch
Harry on performance enhancers suuuuurely
Jj:bearus  Ethan:bossman Iron man
Ngl, would like to try the burning calories than eating.
JJ And Harry Easily Doing The Workout Vikk And Callux: They Are Like A Set 2 And They Just Got Moved Into Set 1 PE 😂😂
Harry can get fit af if he tried. This mans a beast
They should reverse the roles.
Y’all have to do a part 2 but switch the activity. They deserve to eat after all that exercise
Jj is so fat and has a diss track on Ethan with rice gum who is trash at basketball
Only a few thousand to 10 mill plz we love the sideman that watches them plz make then the first UK group that has a diamond play button
josh is such a troll i love that lol
Why is Vik literally Will Mckenzie lol
I’ve been saying this for time, Harry goes underrated. Dude is an athlete and could probably achieve quite a lot if he put his mind to it, my guy🙌🏽🤘🏽
25:45 check the cake and thank me later
ethan is mad annoying now, still love him tho <3
chur the boys doing a usual crossfit class like  i do x3 a week haha.
4:00 Vik gets his athleticism checked again 😂
They should do the reverse now , teams swap goals!
24:47 only cus he got called out for littering in A-Z eating challenge 😂😂
37:13 does anyone know the song/beat name ?
Gotta appreciate cal and harry for putting in the work
25:45 *HOLLLDDD UPPPP LEON MOVVVEEE BRUV NAHHHH*
Claim Here After Million!!!
25:50 at least they had motivation in front if them 😍🤩
next sidemen video switch.
Bruh I could easily eat so much more then thay do I'm big chunky boi
I see sidemen are running out of ideas again
Jj’s deadlift form is deeeeeeeaaaddd
girl at 23:50 as BUNNDDAAAHH
Harry is actually a beast 😂
I need to stop watching this at night cos I’m hungry and it’s too late to make something
What's the name of that sport they're playing?
Anyone else see them watching Nelk at 43:16 ?👀
Am I the only one who noticed the 🎂 at 25:50 👀
I feel so proud of Vikk and Harry they pulled through
Anyone else got nervous when Ethan was screaming in the arcade like waiting for the employee to kick em out 😐
W2s vs ksi 💪
36:20 what was jj doing 😂
I saw them watching Nelk in the tv,i hope they collab sometime😌
Yes
25:50 bundaaaaa
43:04 what is my man doing in the background lmao
43:03, the guy on the right in the back 😂😂
Harry is dope
Tobi is such a nice person.
Any Tyler the Creator fans in the comments? 7:45
Americans call the eating party “Tuesday”
The fit bit should be worn at the left hand since the left hand is closer to the heart so its a lot more accurate
I don’t like how the entire time Ethan wasn’t wearing a mask
so r they tryna loose weight or gain weight?
some of the gyal in the back of the gym section...
They doing cheat burpees wtf
Harry’s got that farmer boy fitness
I couldn’t see the squash ball moving 😂😂
I'm the type of person that doesn't eat much and also doesn't ever exercise and just watching this made me feel SO sick, I actually feel like I might throw up
25:46 look at the bunda in the back oooof
harry made it look easy
Behzs mic is sooooo bad
MAN LIKE LEON Wills in the buildin
Everyone follow my tiktok: 20mrose01
42:34
25:40 check the background
Sidemen need another strength video
anyone know the lofi song at 17:06
Hope they do this same thing next week but switch teams
Nobody gonna talk about the bunda when they are in the gym 🥵
All they wanted was pancakes :  POV: they didn’t get pancakes
callux's speech on not being good at stuff actually inspired me
Have I been lied to, or does the serve in squash not need to go into the box
25:52 thank me later
Awesome vid
W2s drinking NOCCO 😍
Callux should join the Sidemen, just sayin
*C A L O R I E S*
3:32 talia is a lucky girl
No sidemen Sunday from 2021 already a bad start😔
Y’all saying Harry would destroy jj if he trained but if ksi also trained hard and got in shape, I got KSI
Reverse the teams for next time
I feel like these teams aren't random...
Redo and switch sides
Vik was sick in this video he needs to keep it up
When Tobi won Iron Man for Ethan <3
Tobi is the most underrated youtuber ever.
25:51 🍑 in the background
send me the liverpool mask plz me want
25:47 👀
Jj's team is always more fun to watch
I knew that Harry had strength but Jesus Christ hes wham he just doesn’t look as built as he is
Callux likes squash, I see why he didn't make it as a Sideman
why was the race between Josh and Ethan the most exhilarating thing I have ever watched
44:29, ur welcome
Harry needs to fight Jake Paul
Hi
I'm suprised that nobody talks about the baby iron man
25:48 camera guy knew what he was doing!!!!
So far every sidemen workout there has been .  Simon has avoided lmao .
I have never been more attracted to Harry
Is Harry working out? His arms looks stronger and bigger than before
Harry should literally work out. In 6 months he'd be a beast.
Another eating challenge  JJ 🤤 Ethan 🤨 Harry 🤬 Vik😳 Simon😩 Tobi 🤥 Josh😐
Who else skipped the eating team and just watched the exercise team😂
I hope sidemen and nelk do a collab
They watching nelk boys on tv 😳 sidemen x nelk ?????
Ksi needs to fight austin to get that 5 mill
Tobi is so nice getting iron man for bez🥺
Sidemen watch nelk 👌
Smash subscribe
Now swap!
DONT WATCH THESE VIDEOS IF YOURE ON A DIET FROM GETTING FAT IN LOCKODWN
So we just saw Harry out workout JJ, vikk and callux die and the rest of the sidemen act like absolute lazy retards. Perfect video
Do the same but with the teams switching for losing and gaiming weight
26:02 👀
Literally the most serious I’ve seen jj in a sidemen video, he’s back in the training boys
4:05 will we see sidemen squash?????
Who else liked the video at 31:00 just for the effort
josh and ethans friendship is on another level 😂 how they just laugh after they slag each other it’s funny

37:20 chubby ethan from parallel universe in the back
More like burning 10k calories vs having the time of your life
At 5pm when They getting burger king they watching nelk or Steve
Ethan: “bro”
40,000 calories
Tobi is a moodkiller tbh😣
Is Harry on roids?
Banging video, rate the grind
Why didn't Harry's get counted?

I can't be the only person who thought at 12:40 tobi was a fan 😂😂
Isn’t that racket ball?
25:50 your welcome boys
25:50 they definitely staring at that girl on the treadmill
Everyone talking about Harry being good at the gym but he was good at squash as well
this is the funniest josh has ever been, change my mind
Vik playing squash and running into the wall tho 😂
Next sidemen Sunday same vid but have the teams reversed or put the un-edited version of both on more sidemen
Why does vik stand so weird lol
25:49 the cameraman’s being a little sus with the background 😂😂
Thats crossfit training, and harry is killing it
25:52 be coming back to this video after november
Anyone else think it's better when they record it themselves its a better video (obv some parts they didn't but most of it was)

Callux, JJ, Harry & Vik did absolutely amazing they smashed it, each gave it their all
10 mil is so close!!!!
cal looks like harry’s dealer
JJ vs Ethan vs Harry Extreme workout competition  That could be awesome
Anyone notice the girl at 46:49
25:40 🍑🍑🍑
Harry had the best form by far on the rowing machine
25:50 i got u lads
43:30 just watch nelk rq
It seems bulking season has ended for JJ. Man looks thinner....much thinner
25:38. Look in the background on the treadmill. 🥵🍑🍑
Do the same video again but reverse the roles
who is that in the background at 41:27?
Why do they make such a big deal out of everything on the eating team . Simon annoys me man
Everyone talking bout how strong Harry is. But I have a hard time thinking tobi ate 3400 calories he was slacking hard.
46:49 your welcome lads
Ethan made a good vid a class vid
Goddamn 🍑🎂 25:47
25:37 look at the background, your welcome.
Whats the name of the calorie watch?
No wonder Ethan looked fat in the football video
Josh seems really annoying to hang around tbh
25:51. Thank me later
who else saw the bunda at 44:30
Am I the only one that thinks they have 2 much "calories" videos?
Isn't there supposed to be a lockdown in england ?
Same video but roles reversed 🤪
Uk i just wanna be like harry uk what im saying mans good looking strong crazy just damn
Ksi’s deadlift form gave me anxiety
Harry is actually would be a good boxer if he trained
The cupcake looked like Ethan’s jacket
Damnnnn Leon got bundah
Didn’t they do this already???
If I wanted to watch people play squash I'd of been a virgin
Why does vik dress like an 8 year old
25:49 thank me later
The food group segments were like a throwback to old style vlogs, I really enjoyed it!!
Not gonna lie, I’d quite like to see a sidemen squash tournament 👀
Everyone’s saying that Harry did well but Ethan got bullied so much
F
The workout they did was actually really easy😂
Shout out to nelk on the tv
Why Are Gyms Opened In London But Not Reading Mannnn
Who else just wanted to watch the fitness boys side of the video more lol
More..eating.
Can we all just report the bots that are spamming links under every comment?
Harry’s dealer must’ve changed the order up a bit because he was on the same wavelength as the rock 🤣🤣
25:45 SHE GOT BONDAH
Cal's bellybutton be moving maddd
Anyone know the name of the outro song?
Callux is annoying
Sidemen: Arcade challenge - who can win the most tickets and toys in an arcade
Shoutout to Harry well done really put the effort in
Claim here before a million!!!!!!!!!!!!
ethan food drunk
They should do a part 2 and they switch
As far as I’m concerned Harry’s team won lol
JJ still looking chunky but getting there 🤩
Imagine a sidemen last to leave the circle wins $10000
Arent we in lockdown?
Vicks like a little boy
Finally! They are burning some!
is no one going to talk about how buff harry is ?
Dammm Ethan has gone fat again
25.56 she got bunndaa 🤣
Harry gone fat
swap sides next video?
At 25.52 got me
Jj jiggly chest
@ 25:51 that chick tho
Fr tho why didn't they just eat two Pizzas from domino's each?
Does anybody else think the eating videos are very disgusting? I get sick watching them eat so much food, its so stupid, the burning calories is way better than the eating
how is harry so strong tho what he is so consistent in the workout
Cal: my heart is broken  Well yes, we know
37:20 is it only me or does that look like bez when he was really big
Squash is such a white people sport
Surprised by Harry tbh
Harry is a beast tho      Harry vs ????? Boxing match
Any one else pleased at 25:54 / 26:00 ?🙄
Ethan get a mask on lad aha
Look how the majority of the comments are about Harry’s work ethic
Harry and Josh carried this video
I don’t know why but the past 2 sidemen vids have felt like the old sidemen and i have really enjoyed it
Harry form for deadlift is already better than JJ that’s tuff 😅😅😅😅😅
why tf is harry so strong, get this man fighting
Guys. Please can we get them to do a full Sidemen Squash video
Like for ethans trim ❌
25:44
I think we should get Harry to box
Yo Tobi boring as hell
25:50 and look in background...thank me later
25:49 drop the @
I like your cut G, made me like this vid!!!
43:12 watching nelk in the background. Possible collab incoming
25:52 pree the bunda at the back 🤪
Harry built different
what are the bicycyles called the onw with leon?
Tobi next level kind hearted. That’s some real brotherhood.
What is ethans Lock Screen at 7:22
The “your surprised Callux is good at a sport button “ 👇
Is anyone gonna mention the fact how the eating team literally scammed a win cuz they ate 2 small pots of fries which are 1k calories each... like if they didnt eat those they would have lost..
Bro the eating team on this video was so boring lmao. The workout side was alot more funny and entertaining to watch.
Harry surprised me so much in this video he's so good
25:50 = bunda
I can’t be the only one who literally skipped through Ethan’s team every time 😂😂
Harry is so much fitter than flipping jj
Girl in the back at 25.50 has cake
Harry has some real natural athletic ability
Harry is an absolute unit, he kept up with JJ then beat him in the row after everything. Maybe we should see a KSI V Harry Charity Boxing match
Harry is looking buff and tobis jacket is looking fire
I started eating because of the video and then I felt bad and started doing exercise thank u guys hahaha
Stop making Ethan eat food XD lol
If Harry trained, JJ wouldn't stand a chance against him. Man's built like a tank.
vik saying 10’s a sprint for me killed me off
Does anybody else find it ironic that Ethan got the virus and he doesn’t wear the mask
Josh is annoying af always forcing it 😩😭
Toni was soo useless
Bruv whats with jjs form on the deads lol
Harry low key smashed this video
The friendship between Ethan and Tobi is ✨Immaculate✨
Look in background 25:45 thank me later
Swear Ethan turns into a crackhead for food on a eating video 😂
how about 10,000 calorie challenge but the Sidemen make there own food?
What is irritating is Cal is actually not that good at squash, he is just playing people that have never played squash before
If harry actually trained, he could easily beat Jake
32:02 how was harry not dying he isn’t sweaty or heavy breathing at all
jjs in it for the sprint but harrys in for the marathon
Harry’s actually rock solid
Anyone notice the baddie in the back on the treadmills ahahaha !
Vikk training for his boxing match vs Callux
Ngl Jjs kettlebell swings are WACK
Af 25:50 I know what kept the lads motivated if anyone else seen it they will know what I'm on about
Came for sidemen  Stayed for 25:50
Man Harry is looking amazing in these workouts hes better built than JJ
JJ's Team: Doing Workout  Josh's Team: Camera Go ZOOOM
Sorryyyy is Harry getting on his game now????
Didn’t realise one team was trying to lose calories until the end. Thought they were working out to make room for more calories
Harry is actually hench, he should take up boxing and knock tf outta jake Paul cuz he actually can if he trained
Do this the other way around
video idea: simon tries speaking in his normal voice
Ethan’s mask is way to small
Forget JJ, train Harry how to fight and with his conditioning and stamina he could drop Jake Paul
25:50 💪
Nelk in the background. We need a Nelk and SDMN colab
He is hot tho 😏
I neeeeed to see Harry in a boxing match now!!
I got real old sidemen vibes from Josh’s group... memories
This comment section: commenting the same thing just worded differently to try to get likes
No one gonna talk about how they were at Piccadilly at like 27:00
We need a rematch. But teams switch role
simon learned that cupcake technique from jj
Plz bring back cards against humanity it banged
25:50 kon knew where to film
Where are subtitles? Please this is not fair for us all deaf people.
25:50 bundha
Harry smashed it!
Reverse the teams and do it again
i feel like over the past few months joshs personality has really shown in the vids , he seems so fun to be around , esp when he’s with ethan they get so hyper sometimes i love it
Harry’s deadlift form was better then jjs
Ethan ‘bro’ Payne
BRuh I don't think this is safe. 80k is wayy to much. U GUYS  CANT RISK UR LIVES FOR CONTENT.
Baddie @25:30😳
Harry looking hella buffed bro
Sooo we gooot a part 2 coming? Gotta see the teams switch objectives 😁😎
The eating team Should’ve been Vic, Tobi, Simon and callux
Xx
Sick sidemen Sunday vid can’t lie I r8 this vid compared to eating vid 💯
Video idea: sidemen arcade torment? 👍🏻💪🏼🇬🇧
The gym used for squash is called the Southbankclub if anyone is interested
baes
That Leon guy is so wholesome
Come on, 10 million before 2021. 🙏
Video idea: real life chess
Harry took the S from KSI today
Tobi is just bit dead
Did anyone else feel kinda proud for Harry for some reason?
Can we just get a full video of harry working out or is that too much..? 😂
Switch as a next vid?
is there a lockdown in the UK right now. I know this is filmed earlier im just curious
Vik in every video with his Fitbit : mY fiTbIt dOeSnT wOrK. ThiS iS bUlLshIt!!!
They should do a part 2 and they swap
25:50 your welcome boys 🍑
Would like to see they switch around
JJ 100% did not get 55 press ups done at the start
Callux, what a king👑
44:28 1) click this timestamp 2) look to the right side of the video 3) thank me later
I don’t understand is one team burning calories and the other eats or do they combine the their burnt calories and eaten calories. Sum 1 explain plzzzz😂😂
JJ like vik shut up man
What’s the female camera woman insta on jj’s
Don’t lie, we all saw that bunda behind Leon at 25:50
Got a little distracted at 25:45
YO JJ's form on the DEADLIFT was ABSOLUTE garabge m8.
They should make a part 2 where they switch roles
25:50 that girl was flexin'
knees spaghetti
Ethan put on weight
That DL form from JJ LMAO
PART 2 SWITCH ROLES?
MoreSidemen on wednesday: eating team do the gymbox work out
37:36 look at the girl behind harry
16:44 Cause of Sarah
Any of u guys want a squash game I’m no.1 in the country and U have some mad skills🤣👍

Everyone who didn’t know callux  played squash  | |
12:27 fakest laugh ever
29:40 how he do that
25:50 🍑your welcome lads
Anyone notice the girl in the gym 🍑
I hope Behz isn't injured or something I need him back on the grind ASAP.
Damn I think Harry has surprised us all 👀👀
Respect for this video, the losing cal team were machines. This was such a fun watch
I wanna see the different parts individually
44:31 next to Harry
harry got MAD gainz
Sdmn watching nelk 😂
stop those stupid videos and continue on the real life tinder ( make it a series ) and don't forget to bring stephen
Why is ksi blacker then my PS4
JJ doin RDL’s instead of deadlifts lol
I thought Vikks Mike was his chest hair in Nando’s
Man I was watching all the Sidemen eating vid yesterday and now a new one to watch!!
Does anyone know what watch they are using?
Pfft I've burnt 50000 calories, I left the biscuits in the oven for too long
Their form on the rowing machines were terrible
Callux and Josh were bloody hilarious in this video 😂
lol the box jumping from jj vs harry it looks like harry can do it easier lol
They should do this but with 4 sidemen on the burning team and 3 on the gaining team in order to account for the difficulty of the burning team
Harry iss fittt mann likee I remember he was chubby in the faze collab he looks in shape tbh lmaoa
37:38 Chick in the back checking out Harry
37:36 yo that girl cheking out Harry. Dont blame her tho he’s a beast
Sidemen when they’re running out of ideas:  EAT BITCHES, EAT
44:30 - that left pillar looks like its real solid , big up the building constructors
25:52 Kon knew what he was doing :)
25:48 I know I'm not the only one who looked
they didn't even get half way...
The chick behind Leon at 25 minutes though😳
Sdmn X NELK
I feel bad for JJ's back after watching those deadlifts
Callux is sweating from his belly button
43:16 stevewilldoit full send bois
the zoom in on simon made him look like ryan the bald nonce
The background at 25:50 jeeezzzzz
jeez that bunda at 25:50
That breakfast place was playing some absolute chooons
Josh thinking that the winner might be different if it was average vs total
25:48 the bundah
This is like the marathon, but since it's the sidemen, it's a marathon for eating lmao
The gainers were so toxic and the exercisers were happy. Exercise beats depression get at it
Is that Harry's sister working out on the treadmill? 🤭
Jj needs more vids like this to beat jake😂
25:50 bundahhhhhhhhhhh thank me later
If JJ can’t knock tf outta Jake Paul we got Harry
Who else saw that gyal’s arse at 25:53
the fat neek put in the work......
Great video but the form on the rowing machines was tragic lol
I swear u may aswell kick vik out and add callux in cuz my man is useless 🤦‍♂️😭😭
25:48 your welcome boys
peep the nelk playing at 43:21
26:03 is bundha
Gotta see more Cal
Finally seeing jj train really puts a smile on my face
Leon’s arms a huge
37:36 girl in background watching Harry, cmon Harry 💪🏻💪🏻
Bunda at 25:30
25:52 thank me later 👍🏻
25:48
12:51 "Is it average or is it total?" great question Josh...
Everyone talking about how Harry was killing it , yeah , but can we all appreciate how Vik was actually kept going . He might be small yeah , but he did his part brilliantly here
25:45 behind Leon
25:49 welcome boys
Drug abuse ain’t funny Harry doin his thing
I guess after this we gotta see Strength Challenge 3 with simon actually participating and harry showing his “farmers strength. Still think JJ way stronger tho
Around 43:00 the guy in the back on the right 🤣🤣🤣 I can’t
25:58 let’s not forget that girl behind Leon has bundah
i wish people stopped watching the foods ones there still entertaining but others are better and aslong as they get alot of views they will still make them (here i am watching it though) XD
They should do the bleep test on more sidmen
Jjs form on everything is dreadful his poor lower back
Sidemen like nelk lmao 😂
Ethan looks mad old in his video,getting wrinkles
Harry is the white akinfenwa
i would love to the traning with jjs trainer, seems like an amazing  good one
Do it again the other way around
Harry's a beast, would love to see him box
Sidemen surfing in Cornwall
Where is ethans jacket from?
25:48 the girl in back has got that juicy cake 🎂
I hate Callux
The eating team is slacking tbh they didn't try at all
anyone else see the bunda at 25:48
If they didn’t eat those fries they would have lost
if sidemen do food videos they will hit 10 million quicker
Simon is starting to look a lot older now
This has inspired me lmaoo.. im actually about to get out my bed at 6am and go to the gym.
Just proves how naturally physically blessed harry is and if he and jj both worked out like the rest they would be in great condition
Josh: I will not get nonced on Tobi: 😑🤨 Josh: I'm 28 yo, I can't
Petition for callux to join the sidemen
The Rest Of The World: PANIC The Sidemen: Cupcake 19
156K likes  1K dislikes “Noice”
Vol finna get sued by fitbit 😂😂
No one's talking bout the cake 26:50
Big up Harry with them greek god genetics
YESSS IT HEREEE
Does anyone know what app they use to track calories lost ?
Tobi speaks less and less each video
JJ thinks he’s a good boxer 😂
25:46 I zoned out here
Watched the whole video tbh the winners to me were J.J. VIK HARRY AND CALLUX:) WELL DONE:)
Hang on some one pls tell me the answer to this i swear harry was staying in dubi
Brooo hell yea i love squash. Its the best sport eveer
What watch are they using
No one gonna talk about the girl in the back 25:53?🥵
they be watching nelk 43:38
Jj was underestimating Harry that he couldn’t do that challenge that leon set but he did it very very good .harry is jus built different
Just add Cal to the Sidemen already
Nelk boys spotted on the TV on simon's house!
Timestamp 25:49=caaaaaake girl on tedmill
there was some cake in gym box
25:46  With this vue, I could run forever
No-one gonna talk about Ethan's teams microphone quality?
Feel like Harry should work out with JJ for the next fight. They both seem to push each other which will help them both out in the end.
Harry looks like an actual unit
Harry's an absolute unit
Pls do a fifa tournament against each other i would enjoy that so much!
Bless up done know
25:50 look in the background and thank me later.
25:51 girl got cake
that zoom in hahaaha
Lol basically the whole comments section is about Harry 😭
Can we get a sidemen silent library?
Ethans eyes: 👁     👁
21:40 green royal mail van??
They better swap teams and make another vid. People like Simon like to talk a lot and make fun of people like Vikk, yet he's the one who's scared to film anything related to workng out.
Actual Title: Sidemen attempt to rescue Callux's dead channel.
Miniminter not with Ksi ...my god 2020 is mad
amount of likes = how many lines harry bashed in before the workout
One time I was in maths in yr7. And there was this teacher everyone hated and of course I wasn’t listening. So like any civilised human she asks me and I look at my watch and I see bpm 135!!!!!!!! I was sat still.
jj looks in good shape
amount of likes = how many lines harry bashed in before the workout
What was the. Eat a burger joke
Time 25:47 look at his left shoulder!!! Thank me later ;)
Man people think that Harry is unfit and yet he still did better than a fatneek that was supposedly been training since his last fight
a yes more food chalenges
37:39 was the chick in the back checking Harry out
They are in Piccadilly at 26:08
This is jj’s best hair in my opinion
bro please react to this video on the more sidemen channel  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrcFKcCwaJc
Their five guys fries really won them the challenge
25:52 BUNDAH
20:48 vikk eating with the knife and fork the wrong way round kmt
When vik and harry were doing the rope pulls on the slide able seats, look in the top right, for the boys
8 minutes in and the eaters are just boring. I'm just constantly skipping over their parts.
harrys aa beast no cap
Sidemen: we need calories!!!!  also Sidemen: drinks cola zero
Yeah we love to watch the sidemen, eat so what
If I had to eat the most calories, I wouldn't eat every second of the day
What watch is that? If fitbit, what one is it?
Any one else spot 25.21 on the treadmill
the wholesome moment tobi gave ethan iron man🥰🥲
So no one noticed something in the background on 44:30?
It is weird seeing calux good at something
25:48 uffff she’s got bundaaaaaa
For some reason I was singing star boy by the weekend and then they went into the candy store and it was playing tf😳🐬
JJs Deadlift form is trash.
25.47 that girl has bumda
Why is caluxes belly button sweaty
10 mill ???
YEEZUS! SOON 10mil WE CAN DO IT, WE CAN GET THERE BEFORE 2021.   Follow my instagram @linus.budde it would make my day, while im in quarantine
Respect for cal on this video
44:31 harrry right
25:50 they have some nice machines in the back there
47:01 bruh wtf if that women in background 😂
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Watching nelk in the back ground - u love to c it
How fast were they running
Safe to say harry surprised us all
Me: waiting for a sidemen Sunday Also me: I wonder how much they’ll be eating this week
I can't be the only one who wants to see another Rich Vs Poor video?
I recon they should do this all again but swap the goal around for the teams...
leon seems like a nice guy i just want to sit down and have a talk with him
I love how everyone is saying that Harry is the one that should be boxing while he didn't box 1 second in this video lol.. Not everyone is made for boxing
Sidemen Up!
That bunda damn. 25:50
Simon and tobi are very boring youtubers fight me
What's the discount code?
@25:48 ufff she got bunda
Anyone notice how Vik had his camera pointing towards his wall of YouTube awards!??
Ksi deadlift form a bit dodgy
Ethan's jacket is so nice anyone know where its from
Joshes face @ 31:56 😭😭
20:25 osu players, STAND UP!
Why doesn’t Harry’s count
Finally people in the UK are also using cancer as a swear 24:24
Harry buff Yano
Do the same video again and swap teams, see how that plays out
Girl at 25:48 behind the trainer is looking kinda bad not gonna lie
7 mins into the vid and i wonder wtf callux was doin there
44:30 I’m not the only one right
I bet this would get 1.5 mil likes
There trying to say something putting JJ and Harry on the burning calories team
Well this is 1 out of 10
How have some of these lot got the smallest appetites
If Harry actually worked out he’d probably be wham in like 3 months
I like the Sidemen but why do they always stand in the middle of where everyone’s walking
I'm so hungry
25:53 bundaaa in the back
Ethan using a gt-r r34 to race josh in an evo x lol
Next Sunday, switch the roles
Anyone else wanna see a w2s vs ksi boxing match ?
At least we know why Ethan looked a bit bigger in the sidemen crossing video
Harry vs. Jake Paul if ksi loses
I realized how grown up vikk has gotten. From minecraft player to tryhard gamer in warzone. Hope he took the right path.
This calories videos are overrated af imo.edited: I take that first sentence back😂
FROM AMERICA UNFORTUNATELY BUT WANNA BE FRIENDS WITH THE SIDEMEN
48:54 he's dripping
Vik burnt more calories complaining about his Fitbit then he did in the workout
Bring gib on the next one
not sure why but id much rather get freezy then callux ngl
Don’t underestimate the farm boy strength
25:50 they deffo had some motivation going there
aye big ups to Lux. What a champ
Love the sidemen
the women that go to that gym sheesh
I thought gyms and stuff were closed again?
By now it’s just an excuse for them for eating loads of food😂
Anyone else agree the songs in that cafe are absolute bangers 8:40
25:38 look at the girl on the tredmill thank me later
25:50 nice view behind
Put cal in more vids
Ethans team for the first 10 minutes were annoying asf
Get bez on the camera more please
Calorie videos are zzzzzz
i really wish the cals were in the sidemen the quality of comedy n entertainment theyd add is insane.
Harry should be the one boxing, he’s an animal.
vik breaks his shoulder 2.0
If JJ somehow fails to win against Jake, Harry has to pull up.
Now reverse it, and then lets see who won in total
I swear it’s lockdown😂😂
These are getting old like
I NEED ONE SUB  PLEASE GIVE ME ONE SUB ONLY PLEASEEEE
They forgot the discount code 😎
25:47 nice
Harry has always had my respect, but this seals the deal! W2S let’s goooo! ✊🏼
31:00 Simon looks like doby
Sidemen:running  The cameraman:🏃🏃🏃
Ngl the gym looks sick tbh. When I head back to the UK I'll definitely be checking that out 😂😂 also couldn't stop laughing when Vikk said 20 Minuets and how longs the break. Leon 😂😂😂😂😂
Why do I enjoy this
Is anyone elses screen randomly flashing like a light blue light every few seconds
JJ gotta go lower on those push ups. He gotta get full rom
vikk is funny
If Harry wanted to he could literally demolish anyone in a strength test, he just needs to get a personal trainer and grind like JJ did, he is so naturally strong
The girl on the treadmill at 25:49
Ksi's deadlift form.. 27.05
Why don't bbc do sidemen Sundays because it's so boring on Sunday on BBC so they might as well
Ngl the video was dead lad 😭😂
If JJ can’t beat Jake Paul, we got Harry.
Harry is the strongest sidemen confirmed
Harry is a beast
I’m just so proud of them all. So much love and respect for them
45:42 I wasn’t staring at it it was staring at me 🍑
Vikk was doing press up burpees and everyone else was doing the easier version
44:35 behind Harry,thank me later.
Plot twist: they only do these videos because they want fat ethan back
The shot of Leon talking is definitely done on purpose with the girl in the back 😂😂
Part 2 but swap teams
32:18 harry beating jj
The thumbnail is better than the content sorry.
watching them play squash was really fun to see
Next time they switch challenges but same teams.
16:45 Callux: "My heart is broken" Oh we know cal....
not the sidemen touching their mask and eating their food with those unwashed hands and ethan licking it off his fingers
I miss ethan when he was fat as he used to be cuter and i could relate to him.
If harry had the work ethic of jj, he could be even better than jj. Imagine, there both beast boxers together 🙌
Harry's such a beast <3
43:21 They know what's up. Thats Mr. Stevewilldoit on the tv.
Team eating is doing such a bad job filming compare to the other team who actually has a bangin’ video. Well done Harry!
12:01
I’m sorry but callux would of been on his own with that Game 😂 Just hitting the wall would of gotten old to me
Ok but Harry in this 👀👀
That’s a sick gym they’re in
Finally I thought it was only my family that played squash
Harry smashed that work out tbf
When josh zoomed in it reminded me of like the family videos ur parents would record on the camcorder when u were little
Who else saw that bunda at 25:49 🤣🤭
.
I think The Sidemen are better off without Ethan and maybe replacing him with cal
Did anyone acc see someone in the kitchen 38:31
imagine squash being your favourite sport
Can we talk about cals belly button sweat patch😂😂
Harry’s actually a beast
Firstly stop doing food vidssss secondly collab with tgf and nelk needs to happen
29:53 lol josh is a goat
This video must’ve been recorded time ago, how are gyms open. Unless rich people can get these kind of gyms
My depression  Side men: Its Sunday again
Why is Harry so good looking when he’s in gym
If Harry went to the gym more often he would be a monster
No one no one at all   Karen’s in the comments  WhY AReNt tHEy WeARinG mAsKs
Viks eyebrows could carve a pumpkin wtf
whos that bird that was taking picture in the squash match
im droping a like on the video just for the effort of the burning team, well done lads
What’s the song called at 34:35 chain smokers something I think
bro look at ethans beard!!
Ethan has been a bit violent since he lost weight. Just saying.
So that is why ethan looked fat in the moresidemen video
I could do better than either team doing either challenge Built different
Ayyy NelkBoys 43:25
Finally outdoor sidemen vlog!!!💪💪💪
🤣🤣🤣 jj deffenetly did 55 push ups
35:00
Yo what did the trainer say at 24:45?👀
So close to 10 mil jeez
Im pretty sure if tobi’s team didn’t eat the five guys fries vics team would have won
I want friends like this
Normal people: I have a few chips KSI: i have a little bit of crisps
Omg harry
AYO 😳 25:50
1 like on this for josh to shave his beard off
Is callux sweating from his belly button only?
Harry Vikki Ethan jj- elite group
As a rower, watching them do the indoor rowing machines is hell
9:25
if only callux was part of the sidemen and involved with all the vids over the years... He'd deffo be top half of sidemen members
Ethan has got to stop sayin  bro
Im not sure how i feel about Callux practically joining the sidemen👀
Vik needs to gain calerories  not loose them 🤣🤣
Lol I do burpees with the jump at the top
Obsessed with the fitness
I think lux and freezy should join sidemen.
W2s vs joe weller ?
Oh wait we'ee so close to 10 mil subs guys on under 200k more
Tell Simon to post his spider man mikes morales part 3 gameplay soon
4h after sidemen upload vid 1.3m views 4h after me uploading a vid 4 views
JJ's and Callux's deadlift form... OUCH
Eating team seemed baked out of their heads
Do more work out challenges... just workouts tho... and just for JJ...🙃
Could easily watch a whole video of Cal playing squash
do this again but roles reversed i want to see simon and josh do it
The boys watching NELK at 43:40  let goooo
25:52 girl in the back bhad asf
25:50 enjoy lads 👍🏻
45:40 That rowing form is mad
finally jj actually gets to exercise LMAO
callux's form be like {
1:46 such a baddie
I’m pretty sure the heart rate is faster just after a workout so I don’t think viks Fitbit was lying, he was probably just making excuses
6:05 I genuinely can’t tell if josh is greying or if he’s got a fade
does lockdown just not apply to london
Josh is the best camera men
ksi bruv ur deadlifts were hella wonky from the start
JJ acting skinny when he's still fat
They should do a part 2 and switch
Vik needs braces
Is one group losing calories and one group gaining ?
33:55 he's not good at YouTube and he doesn't mind it
Never seen josh laugh so much in a vid 😂
Bro jj faked the push ups
I don’t like these videos tbh.
I might kms after seeing JJ's deadlift form
I’d love to see more squash from the sidemen and cal
Definitely can’t call jj a fatneek if he keeps this up
Jeeez I swear only last week they hit 9mil
Ayy harry on anotha level.
LETS GOO IL SQUASH I PLAY FOR MY COUNTY
@25:40 - @26:00 👀👀🍑
next week reverse the roles
Are they in Piccadilly  xD 25:28
Let's be real boys who was looking a t him at 25:45 ? 😅
25:48
Am I the only one who thinks Ethan getting a little bit too much in some situations?
Most liked comment?
The bunda  at 25:55 😍😂
PART 2 TEAMS VICE VERSA
I thought boris said stay at home not go and eat food and gain 80,00 calories 🤣🤣🤣
Was it only me that thought it was really funny when Ethan couldn’t get the iron man 🤣
Ayo what steroids is Harry on
Whatching this vid while eating Shwarma
37:35 the blonde lass is eyeing up Harry
big up the editers mad job on the vid 👍
30:43 brooooo zoomed everything makes it 20x funnier 😂😂😂
44:38 look right to Harry boys.....
Michael Jackson man in the mirror at 25:23
GymShark: *we need athletes*  Sidemen: *80,000 calories challenge*
A better title is the sidemen try to get *Ethan fat again*
Ethan says bro way to much😂
Sidemen should do a $10,000 flight vs a $100 flight
25:52 that girl in the back has bundah
Harry gets his supply from Bradley Martyn
At the end when they were eating the fries it seriously looked like they were in Piccadilly
If Harry went gym loads then he'd be huge
46:01 she gettin that Cake
Harry looking wham ngl. proud of the lad
Harry is a beast damn bro he keepin up with JJ
I think harry has a lot more athletic ability cuz he’s able to keep up with jj who trains every day n Harry doesn’t anyone agree?!?!?
How many times are they gonna make the same vid🤦🏽‍♂️ these lot are gonna fall off
25.59 She got BUNDAAAAAA
What is ethans cameras sound
16:35 is that just me or is the cloud not rendering in properly😂
Tobi is rarely seen in this video, he needs to open up more
43:16 ya'll gonna ignore the fact that there watching The Nelk Boys?
Harry form was better than ksi
How is Harry so naturally fit?!
harry is actually built tbf
Was this filmed pre lockdown or not?
Pension for Harry vs Jake Paul
I feel like they could’ve actually tried like they ate hardly anything
Callux: I;m about to Die   JJ: Laughing
44:29 look right of Harry 👀
I can’t be the only one surprised at how fit Bog is
harry should be the one boxing, he's an animal
As I'm eating cake
I like your cut g
Tobi giving ethan iron man completely sums up his character
Blue sweater chick is hot 1:44
that vid screamed old sidemen
Everyone : jj’s the strongest sidemen  Harry: Hold my ket 😭
I want a sidemen squash tournament
Harry looks stronger than ksi
Discount code ?
Why simon look like a homeless man at the first of the video. LOL
Harry's not for the streets... he's for the gym's
Aha look at his grey hair
lmfao             bruh
who is the lady in the back when they are playing squash?
45:25 that girl in the back got BUNDAA
Earliest I’ve been! Good morning from Australia <3
now we need same teams doing the other side of the challenge
Sidemen X Nelk collab
Reverse it another time?
It just Simon deep throting
Vikk needs to get off cold war and get exercising
3.30 Tobi asking for some frosting but no one paid attention 😭
Fuk mi as
@t i sell vpns and others thing like GTA 5 mod menus join my server for more info
43:10 aye the lads are watching the boys on tv, would love to see a collab
King Harry
Part 2 to this... switch the teams🙌🏼
80,000 calorie challenge but instead they do 30,000
Leon looks like the friendliest beast.
Big bunda at 25:48
What's the name of the girl at 25:52? She has an extraordinary booty
the eating team were so dead hahahaha
Harry got the farmer boy strength. My boy is just built different.
Not a lockdown or anything rn
i love these guys so much
25:48 😏😏😏😏
bro watching the team burning calories is so much more interesting in my opinion
26:05 = cake
What watches do they have?? And are they accurate💫
10:56 love the stevie wonder
The deadlift form is painful to watch... Entertaining video again as always tho !
As a rower...... it is painful watching them use the ergo 😂😭
Ksi:  He protecc  He attac But most importantly    He fatt
Yay finally everyone can see what kind of a beast Harry is.
Do part 2 but switch the teams on the next sunday
Ethans WAY to happy
Callux fancy a squash match?
Sidemen need 10mil subs!!  Save Sidemen Sundays (Simon said on podcast they're going to stop Sidemen Sundays if they don't)
When all u need to do is 1 person eat 11 snickers for a group of 4 and ur done
Was I the only one who was flinching thinking the ball was gonna hit the camera
Harry's a monster
25:50 just wow
can we see this again with switched teams
If I’m being honest Josh’s laugh is so adorable 🥺😂❤️
damn the gym had some fine chicks, bad asf
Toby giving ethan an iron man is very wholesome
That 1 uncle 14:09
Without Simon Sidemen would just be d
I don’t get it are they burning or consuming calories
Did anyone else see the modern warfare map at 25:28
Props to callux for saying yes to this video
watched this while eating a dominos
25:50
The eating group are one compliment away from sucking eachother off. 😂 I legit saw a four man date.
the ones burning shold be the winners
If Harry Committed to getting stronger, he could beat KSI in boxing
this wasnt even a challenge lol this was just a sidemen vlog done the old fashion way
43:35 shoutout @NelkBoys
26:00 ... iykyk
Ethans sugar rush was unreal
25:50 the bundaaaaa 🤤
They should do the same video but vik harry jj and cal do tye eating
15:30 there is two types of friends, "go on do that" and "I beg do not do that"
Social distancing left the chat...
This comment section definitely loves harry
JJ’s form is dreadful😭
Side men watching nelk big up full send boys ayy
Who else looking at the 🍑 26:00
Those five guys fries saved their game
25:29 me when i was 9
25:40 for the boys
“SQUEEZE IT” had me I can’t lie 😭😭😂😂😂
Did anyone else see callux tell some random guy to ‘get out my way’ why do aggressive 18:04
42:37 Behz is evolving, just backwards
Jj should buy a wii with wii sports so he can practice boxing
Oi harry is mad
I would love to see this again with the team goals switched
29:53, Josh is the real driller.
The Sidemen in this video:  Simon: Tries everything in one bite Josh: Pi**ing of everybody Ethan: Hits josh because hes annoying Vik: "Why is my BPM so low??" Harry: Working hard the whole video Callux: "Im gonna die" Tobi: doesnt eat much... normal day for him JJ: tries to catch up with harry
finally we found something callux is good at
25:50 just behind Leon, thank me later
i want leon as my trainer fr
HELP ME GET RATIO THE SIDEMEN
25:50 just saying look behind him
Fair play to Callux for doing this 💪🏻
Stock market ads
JJ doing 10 push-ups, and being out of breath camera cuts he hits 55
WE NEED MORE OF THIS JJ NEEDS TO EXCERSISE XD
Ethan really looks like Luther from Umbrella Academy
No one pointing out how small ethans mask is
Harry is a beast
I like that Simon, Tobi, Josh and Ethan is watching nelk😍
vikk harry & jj = best group
We gotta see the reverse!!
What arcade in London did they go to? Does anyone know?
Harry has that form thats why hes looking like a unit
from this video we learned that harry is build different
vikks so about his numbers lool
am I the only one that skipped all of Simon, Josh's Tobi's and Ethan's bit because I wanted to watch JJ, Vikk, Callux and Harry doing workouts. Workouts are the best
Seems liks Vikks' fitbit just never works every time they do these kind of things
Can someone please tell me the background song at 16:28
10:37 legends say it wasn’t time lapsed
bring back moo off
26:33 i thought josh vomited
Vikk: Just a lite 5k jog Cameraman: *visible stress*
This is madddddddddd
25:50 the boys got a nice view for their run
As a rower Harry's erg form is almost perfect
Poor Vik
Part 2 with same teams but swap roles like so they see
Why does callus have much higher bpm than the rest? Not active enough?
Harry bossed this so much, the burning team overall banged it but Harry rinsed and didn’t complain at all. What a guy
who else enjoyed watching josh and ethan race
Can we get calfreezy in the sidemen
AMAZING keep up the work
38:55 f in the chat
I forgot jj has a fight coming up that’s why he is not on the eating team lmaooo good luck jj 😂😂
Who is the girl with gray shorts at 25:51 😏
what is even this video
43:10 *FULLSEND*
The Sidemen videos are so long..... I aint complaining keep watching #DoWeEvenHashtaganymore #LONGvideosYESSir
4:50 Elz and Behz are made for each other
JJ when doing push ups your ment to touch the floor with your nose
Leon is a beast
WOW!!!
Video idea:          Matt stonie vs the sidmen 24hour calorie challenge
Can we all take a moment to respect KSI’s creps
JJ has bad deadlift form...
Harry is stronger than I thought
Good vid👍
Alternative Title: Tricking Callux into Imploding his own heart
37:20 is it Ethan 4 years ago?
Harry transformation video coming soon.
Never thought i'd enjoy watching squash 😂
Get callux on the sidemen
There’s a video in your ads
Vik put on calories while playing squash
JJs deadlift form is doodoo my god
JJ's form is poor compaired to Harry
imagine how sad it would be to see Ethan get fat again
Man like Harry
Tbh Ethan is really putting on weight, hope he aight...
UUUFFF LEON’S GOT BUNDAAAH 28:06
Imagine doing the calorie challenge stoned
Everyone like this comment so we can see a part 2 where they swap roles  If it gets 10k likes they have to do it
big props to harry
Anyone else find themselves skipping the exercise and only watching the food 😂
Why was ethan on the eating tean he worked so hard to lose weight
They should do it where they all eat and lose 5000 calories
Harry is too fit workin out
Why is harry lookin kinda buff
The eating team bits were dead tbh
36:45 what happened
The two different groups are filmed at different times Kons girlfriend is on both films of it.thought they were filmed together :(
Harry is actual strong
Five guys was a fruad .
If Harry worked out on the regular he would actually be so wam
That girl in the squash room was low key fine tho
Why does it look like Morgz’s girl in the gym
mmmm... his shoulder is so big and juicy 25:50
Sidemen are so close to hitting 10 Mil subs!
Hate to say it cos I’m so proud of what he’s done but Ethan is getting fat again😢
Ethan bro wear your mask properly
When Ethan goes on a rant 😂😂
32:55 i know that feeling so well and have never heard of anybody that has the same thing. I am good at stuff in the beginning but I can never get better, for a beginner I’m usually quite good but if were to actively train I wouldn’t get much better if any better at all! Like I love playing football and I have done so for so many years but I’m still really bad. Only sometimes do I have a game of madness but it never ever lasts and it always pisses me off. I’m always trying to do literally everything the best I can, even for small things like doing a bottle flip and if I’m not good enough I’ll get pissed off
Make a video where u have swapped
How’s Harry doing every single exercise with better form than JJ
I’ve just realised that we’re in lockdown rn so how are all these things open?
Someone get Ethan a bigger mask, it’s irritating tf outta me
25:47 that girl in the back a baddy u know
25:49 in the back. Thank me later
Nice to see them all having a good time all things considered
JJ: Does deadlift  *Form has left the chat*
It really is hard to gain wait than to lose it but I guess they've proven me wrong
They need to do this again but with the teams:  Exercise: JJ Harry Ethan Simon  Food: Josh Vik Tobi Lux
Low-key want Callux in the sidemen now 🤣🤣
I didnt know Lux is acctually good at a sport 😂
harry is acc good at squash wtf
Next week, same teams, opposite tasks
Leon = bugzy malone
25:46 thx for the cake
Even JJ s boxing couch said Harry s strong so what can we say ??? :))
MAX FOSHHHH
Harry should start doing boxing
Vikk: we are going to be playing callux’s favorite game Me: football  Vikk: squash What ?!?!?
Nothing new to Ethan
What did lux say to Ethan at the end??
legit harry smashed this challenge, also making JJ get a run for his money
at 20:50 i thought vic just had some mad chest hair 😂
all of harrys controller throwing has trained him for this
Harry is now an athlete as he said he would be
Just by watching this vid i Never wanted to eat and do sport at the same time in my life i don’t know why
People who say josh ain’t funny..... stfu he’s hilarious no cap
JJ: I’ve just woken up JJ’s watch: 407 steps  JJ explain 🤔
new video: wroteshaw vs Logan Paul
They should definitely incorporate fans into sidmen Sundays like 5 aside matches each is a player coach, marathons, races etc..
14:07 the sidenen are the only people who flex at an arcade
13:45 what does callux say here?
Idk why it was fun watching four people just workout
how are the two fat neeks the most fit lol
YouTube: How many ads? Sidemen: Yes
I want a burger now!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your all on about Harry’s form but are we not gonna talk about the lady on the right at 46:57😶
The chaotic energy of the eating team had me in tears 🤣
Vikk ur so dumb. Your heart rate increases straight after exercise to supplement the oxygen defici
When your sibling wants to take one bite of your food: 3:35
since when was harry that strong
Get those elbows in on your push ups JJ
Jurjedodkrorkdknsis toyot
The chemistry between them in this vid is no genuine and nice to c ❤️
Honestly big up to everyone on the burning calories team. They all tried their hardest
Damn jj lookin thicc in this lol 😂
I honestly had the biggest smile when I saw this video 😍
we all know which team won the battle of the toilets.. which i think it's the most important battle ;p
1 team is gaining calories the other is losing it
Ha ha ha ha JJ isn't gonna be fat neek if he keeps up with this
29:40 in sync
props to harry in this video. legend
Finally our fat neek starts training
25:45 ok, a question for the boys and lets be honest, who did not look at the ting in the background.
25:45 we all know what we were looking at
Honestly never knew Vikk whined so much. Im using this circuit thanks guys. 😘💪🏽
JJ is looking a bit slimer
KSI FIGHTING JOHN CENA
Ohhh that's why ethan was looking fat af in the more sidemen football vid lol
"I can do it on a video game not in real life."  Vik 2020
LOVE TOBI, BUT HE'S SO BORING IN MOST VIDEOS...
I have never seen jj so motivated for a challenge
Is Harry drinking a NOCCO Caribbean?
Legend says that Cal has no muscle... 🤔
Ethan is such a big headed tosser
what watches does ksis team use
Big Harold is actually a unit
Wtf was that erg form
Who else wants cal to join sidemen ?
Do it again but switch the teams around
Surely it wouldve made more sense to the eating team to just uber eats a bunch of food to a flat? Or am I bugging
JJ ur not going down far enough for push ups g
harry got a beast of a form
I hope harry sees all the positive comments here
Next Zerkaa Thursday: I ate the remainder of my calories from sidemen Sunday
For the next week they play they should reverse the teams
I feel like the sidemen would be utterly surprised at how well I would do at eating calories... I'm not a huge person.... But I am by heart I love food if they ever decided to do this in america vs fans they should hmu (america has some good food joints bro)
17:28 mans driving an r34 yelling its me and josh is drifting a awd evo x
This video makes me miss the circuits we did in pe at school
45:23 in the background your welcome
I love how KSI motivated Vik :)
43:15 SHOUTOUT THE NELK BOYS
JHEEZE HARRY IS A MADMAN
Harry is a beast
If ksi failed at yt I could see him as a heavyweight boxing champion
24:25
I can already see JJs Reddit looking for angles of jj
so everybody is praising Harry (fair play Harry did  well) but nobody is gonna talk about a possible Sidemen x Nelk crossover. (43:15)
Are they supposed to be wearing masks or ?
Jake Paul vs Harry-W2S
what's ethan's puffy jacket called? what brand?
@36:54 ethan look like marge from the simpson’s💀💀😳
25:53 the girl in the back showing us all up with that cake!!!
omg this video was recorded like 2 months ago
13:47 Cancer man for a cancer challenge
Shoutout to the bunda at the back at 25:50
37:35 chicks sneaking a peak at my boi Harrold
WTF are those push ups JJ
Ayo big up Harry
The rowing machine technique actually hurt to look at
Goddamn Cal is a boss at squash
dricker w2s nocco lol
So i see London is not in lockdown then
Fullsend on the TV 43:25
Was This Filmed before lockdown?
25:48 bunda
44:29 on the right thank me later
They really have to stop having Ethan in the eating team. I don't like the thought of him getting back into bad habits..
People who love sidemen👍🏼
RIP Discount Code
i actually loved this video man the vibes were so good
Callux is just such a dead person ngl
20:52
Cal Thinks he’s a beast huh
Ksi: let him destroy us   Me: that’s what she said
I’m sorry vik is so unco
Ethan and Tobi's low-key friendship is my favourite of the Sidemen bc there's never been anything but respect between the bois.
Jk saying he runs everyday but he gets tired over playing some tennis game
Anyone know the address for that candy shop?
Would love to see the same challenge but swapped groups
Always making us smile with their videos :)
The amount of times Ethan said Bro in this video 👇
Harry is a beast
Did i just saw a free quraan?
28:29 lmao that face
Tobi and Ethan were lowkey vexed by Josh. I felt bad Josh was being such a cutie
Harry is a new man after his break up
This explains Ethan looking chubby in the football challenge 😂
Harry could be hench if he tried
Harry was surpriseingly strong tbh to keep up
Bro Harry a beast. Tbh I thought that the eating calories people was going to win by a lot but instead it was a good match.
How is cal so good at something?
Even if Simon and Josh didnt eat those fries at the end they still would have won; by only 28 calories though tbf.
can we just agree callux is better than calfreezy
turns out vic just has arythmia
Why can't callux use his hips??
More rocket league videosss pleasee
I knew a guy like Harold in college. He would literally eat his wait in burgers and then go work out. I tried keeping up with him on his work out but I could never keep up. Big props to Harold the guy is a beast.
25:50 she’s got bunda wtf
anyone know how much they were deadlifting
KSI deadlift form is making me cringe
Next video they switch it around
This is why Ethan looked fat in the more sidemen video
https://youtu.be/LgIop9jKNv8?t=2489 when jj has his calories on screen its not - lol
Can I say, that gym looks hella good yukno
Leon is such a vibe tbh
Ksi deadlift form is questionable
26:00 was anybody else distracted by the background ;)
guys we need the matt stonie collab..
As an American, I can speak for all of us by saying we could smash this challenge
They should do reverse teams for more sidemen
Girl on treadmill is slosh.
I live in the us I’ve never heard of that gym it looks real nice
Harry should box
Ethans pupils remind me of harry ,'.'think about it ;)
Harry vs Jake???
44:41 ur welcome
“Is it average or total”  It would be the same...
We gotta get this but with swapped teams
How did KSI manage to 56 push ups
They should do this again but switch
What happened to jj's foot
25:55 BUNDAH
Meanwhile vik playing cold war
I think jj needs it cause he's super fat
They should switch teams next week
39:46 omg will it actually be a moo of this year?!?!
They should do a rematch but switch the teams
Now we find out why Ethan was putting on pounds
why yall not eating nuts like 200g of salted peanuts is 5k cal
Best one yet lads
fIVe GuyS RegULaR ChiPS 950 cAloRiEs.....sure
Absolute banger from the lads, I cried laughing
I knew that Harry had strength but Jesus Christ hes wham he just doesn’t look as built as he is
25:56 the cake 🎂
Callux rekt them in babmenten thing
3:09 ksi be looking kinda fat tho
did anyone notice how hot that girl on 25:50 is ??
Take these eating challenges seriously man. Tobi backseat member
Hope there’s a reverse of this next week where they switch roles
I actually play squash and I‘m cringing sooooo haaaaaaard looking at the guys play😂
24:45 Thank me later lads
Maybe this is why Ethan looked like he'd put on a few pounds in the football vid
harry should really try this whole youtube boxing thing as well
Bro ksis deadlifting form is so dead lmao
i feel like harry has some superhuman natural strength within him
do a drinking challenge with the nelk boys
853643th
34:34 Tobi’s walk was too clean🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
i don’t know how i see these kinds of things but look at the right side at 44:29
who saw that they were watching Nelk or Steve at 43:14. Big ups
calories vs counter-calories
I thought this was tooo much cutting I'd rather have the segments a bit longer cuz i couldn't really follow each thing The editor was jumping too much around
Props for Ksi for actually doing those pushups 😂
One of my ads said I can win a Fitbit for free😂
Harry be looking jacked
harry should go to the gym with calfreezy
Sidemen watching Nelk come on
They should do this video again with the same teams, just they switch roles
harry's dealer definitely puts steroids in the mix
25:46 for some  🎂
I dont know why everyones calling harry the beast jj dominated in the rowing machine
Why can Ethan fit so much in his mouth? 🤔
Same teams switch places
Do sidemen I’m a celebrity and try some of the bush tucker trials
We cant call jj a fatneek anymore... I see his tactics here....
43:18 Bread and Wine things  HOLD TIGHT JESUS 😂😂😂😂😂
jj will always be fat no mater what
Omg i feel so bad for them on the airbike its literally the worst fkn shiii to be created
The girl At 25:40 sheshhhhh
JJ uses this challenge as an excuse to eat more  fatneek  Edit grammer
25:50 I can’t lie I wasn’t looking at the trainer😅😂
If JJ somehow fails to win against Jake, Harry has to pull up
Vick spent more time checking his watch than he did working out
Via needs to start playing sports man hahahha
25:44 daaaaamn girl
Is it just me or in the thumbnail is Kon ?????
Please do dis again
Next sidemen Sunday reverse the roles 🤔
Harry is a tank he Just shuts up and gets on with it no excuses
25:50
What watch are they useing?
25:50 I am enjoying the back view tho ,,, holy smokes ok that treadmill 🔥
When the sidemen don’t know what to do So they just do a calories video
Anyone else checking out the girl in the back while he was talking about vik struggling at like half way
Geez that rowing machine technique is trash they gunna hurt themselves
Cheeks 26:00
If u want accurate heart rate need to use a hr strap. Wrist hr is so dodgy
Do this video in reversed teams
Gotta love leoj
Someone should show this to jj olatunji
I rate vik sm. he pushed himself soo much
.
3:35 no wonder Simon sleeps with JJ 🤣 & @ 22:47 simons face made me laugh
I need to know the playlist Harry got to motivate him for that long
Next time please switch. I want to see Simon and Josh doing Work out
hench
simon was jarring this video and i dont know why
jj after this video: Am I skinny now????? reddit:no
all I can think of hearing that callux likes squash is that he used to play loads of eton fives when he was at boarding school ahaha
The zoomed in segment sent me 🤣😂😂😂
Harry is actually really fit
Ethan should’ve been on the losing calorie team so we can see how much of the beast he is
Love this video
Harry is a beast yo
12:33 mans sweating from his bellybutton
25:48 the girl in the back has got nice shorts
I am 13 and can do more pressups than jj without stopping
Getting distracted by how good Harry looks 😂🔥🔥
Shout out to the workout team and callux
everyone's gassing up harry but not jj man. put some respect on his name
I love how Vik has no idea how heart rate works and just says 100bpm all day lmao
Yess
25:55 I got a bit distracted
Don’t chat to Harry 😂😂💪
im so fcking hungry Right now!
Finally we have proof of the fatneek training
I hope this was made before lockdown boys
i’m surprised that harry isn’t the strongest sideman
32:54 I actually can relate a lot Cal Love the spirit mate
We need a redemption video with Callux! Poor guy actually agreed to this one when others wouldnt haha
Video idea for callux, play squash against fans if they win £100 if they lose they do a forfeit. Get this loads of likes so it makes it onto the reddit
I used to eat 3,200 calories a day for years this would be light work
Calorievids are awesome!
the girl in 25.51🍑🔥
I would love being a camera man for the sideman seems like a fun job 😂😂😂
Josh didn't play F1 for nothing that overtake fam 18:44 what a legend
25:37 onwards look behind
25;40
Who else replayed 6:28
Tobi said nothing😂
Those calorie counts are sus, I suppose so are the calorie burners
24:24 oh cancer this is so fast
Ive legit created over 50 accounts to subb to sideman to try and help the 10 million subscriber mark cause i love sideman Sundays there amazing
Harry n vik wouldve been more fair lol
All that time training and JJ can’t even deadlift properly 🤣🤣
6:22 🤣
We just gonna ignore cal’s belly button sweating the ocean...
they should make a part 2 but change side
I hate calorie challenge
Ever notice how they all have atleast 4 channels
Guess what I was staring at at 25;47
Why isn't Callux sidemen?
Can we just talk about Harry’s stamina. He gave JJ a run for his money
Can anyone tell me the name of the watch that vik wears at 20:01?
38:26 what he say?
we love Harry! :)
harry is a beast
If Harry wanted to, he could be so fit, and shout out to Cal doing this with them
They should do it the other way round so vikk, callux, JJ and Harry do the eating and the other team do the work
25:45 ur welcome bois
I hate josh.
The eating group really thumbed this in.
AYOOI THE CAMERA GIRL VALID NGL😏
Pls collab with tgf bro
Callux is finally good at something
Sidemen video idea, all 7 do that crazy work out everyday for a month and see what change it makes
Harry got 3.3k btw
daaaamn... didn't expect harry to do the ropes for that long. RESPECT
Harry is going to be the one to fight jake Paul not jj 😂
Everyone forgetting that Harry played table tennis 🤔🙃
Everyone talking about Harry but the work rate from jj is acctually crazy
Fat neek I jj
Vik is one weak man
stickstar123
I just wanna know why this video’s named “Sidemen *80,000 calorie challenge”
Guys what was the discount code
Harry is actually doing the exercises right compared to JJ who is slackin lol
25:54 background
Harry looking good
Good to see them all enjoying life
Harry is wearing vapourflies so does jj
Noones going to talk about their technique on the row-ergo? No one?
25:49 anyone have her number 😏
Damn! Harry has me shook! Mans a beast 💪🏽
Ethan should have switched with callux. The mans looking a little thick ya know
That girl checking Harry out🤠
viks wrist is probably too small
if harry would have fought logan in the place of ksi then he would've knocked out logan in the 1st round m8. xD
What cameras do the sidemen use!!!!!??????
Disorgased
If Simon can do that, imagine what he does with Talia
Do they all live together ?
It’s so funny seeing JJ trying to prove to everyone that he is not a fat neek
37:52 wtf happened
At 43:20 u can see Steve will do it
Tobi is a genuinely nice person and it’s good to see
Yo Harry killed it
Ayo iron man a bit sus 45:34
No way jj do that many push ups
Ae oh lez go
Harry 😼.
5:29 I can safely say that 99% of things I do in a video game I CANNOT do in real life
Part 2 maybe
Should do it again and swap the teams round
nelk
30:40 i am dying :))))
I’d slap cal at squash. No cap
Lux should be sidemen
24:26 that guy is iconic and the alexander mqueen banner 🤣
Just me that thinks during these eating challenges tobi never does as much as the others not hating I love tobi just an opinion
Where did behz and the others go to the arcades id love to know where that is
Switch the teams for a vid
jj needed this
44:30 that mad booty right there👀
Part 2? Reverse.
should of had calfreezy bcos he is training in the gym
Sidemen moo off 3!!
Harry's a beast ngl
Help me find the girl at 1:46
Who loves the outro
24:18
JJ'S ONLY AIM WAS TO BEAT HARRY AND HARRY WAS JUST CHILLING
I’m here at 666k views😦
Next do a reverse
yo whatd good with callux? does he have a heart condition or nah? just concerned
LUX !!!
They should do this but reverse the teams
ppl flexing ps5   ethan: look at ma chocolates
Squash favourite sport? Callux defo a Tory
Enjoyed everything with the cal burning group, the eating was kinda boring compared
Did I miss the discount code?
What is going on with Callux's hips?
Seems like Harry is one of those people who have extremely good genetics ! would love to see him doing a fitness journey
the main characters of the sidemen in the thumbnail again x
All the rowers just crying at there technique rn
ChrisMD would’ve been better than Callux
Whats harry doing at 22:02-22:06 😂😂😂
Y’all need to a eating challenge with Eddie Hall
Watching KSI’s team perspective will just be a banger video by itself.
4:08 big up NELK Boys haha
Such a good video ! Also the footage from the 'eating' group had something almost nostalgic because the were messing around  Keep the hard work boys 🙌🙌
I cant tell if jjs sweat was dripping onto his arm or his tears when losing to harry and cal 48:51
All of us runners cringing at the fact that jj is wearing next% for a workout at the gym and an easy run🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
That ket is doing Harry wonders
25:40 dayumm
I swear there subcoun hasn’t changed
Why is everyone liking this comment
Yo Harry is actually big body
I mean how sure are we that Harry isn't using performance enhancing drugs jk jk
JJ was going try hard so we would stop making fat jokes about him
Cal should really get his heart checked if he has not.
JJ has seemed so much happier lately. Good on him
Stevewilldoit in The back 43:44
Well now we know how Ethan put so many pounds on.
Ethan is getting a bit big again
this was all an excuse for JJ to lose weight
I was expecting Oladunday to order fries and cheeseburger lol
Anyone else see Nelk on on their tv?
8:30
Alternative Title: Fatneek Weight Loss Compilation
The race was more intense than the whole challenge
Ngl I feel like Harry could look so sick if he just worked out like today
Callux is so entertaining man
28:05 that boy THICC
Boys watching nelk 👀
Tobi didnt eat 3.5k he definitely cheated
How is the sidemen still not at 10 mil???
WHY IS EVERYTHING FOOD BASED ON THE SIDEMEN CHANNEL NOW
25:48 behind his shoulder thank me later
am i the only one that noticed the chick recording for them at 6:33 👀
5:41 Ian's food battle food
44:28 - far right of the screen. Thank me later.
Harry vik and JJ is an underrated team😅
how the hell kon's GF kirsty is at two places at the same time.. she is with ksi lot @ 25:50 nd with simon lot next min at 26:24.. Big Fraud u lot lol
i like how UK has like 50k deaths and in this video nobody wears a mask(i know it was filmed a few weeks ago this deosn't change anything) and here in Greece we have a total lockdown with barely 1k deaths..
Why was watching Ethan and josh race, actually intense?
25:51 fam noones lookin at leon
The fat neek returns to S T R O N G NEEK
25:50, I think I know what we're all really looking at 👀
REVERSE ROLES
Vik: My Shoulder!!  Everyone in the room getting flashbacks of the ski trip: 👁👄👁
40:10 jj really wasnt tryna talk to vik, that was the fakest laugh I done ever seen
Did anyone recognise that cake at 44:30 at the top right corner?
yooo u guys be getting too comfortable with the ads
Harry could literally be a beast
harry was impressive af. callux was also a good addition
Callux releasing his depression of Sarah leaving him though squash.
jj's form on the deadlifts though. Never seen worse
17:20 literally had me dying
Tobi giving Ethan the teddy bear🥺🥺🥺
video idea: sidemen become women for a day
damn, Harry really got that Farmer Strength 😳
For a crackhead Harry is pretty fit 😂
Harry and jj are the fastest because they both are wearing AirPods
The banter in the end when they catch up with each other is always the best
ethan said i like ya cut G to someone who had cancer
Shoutout to the sleeves on Leon's shirt for not completely tearing apart
19:27 ethan looking for his toy 😂🥺
Is it just me or does the cloud at 16:35 look like it’s glitched and half of it’s been cut off??
Squash bangs uno
Isn’t Harry in Dubai
Vik and his fitbit
My grandfather hit my grandmother on the head at squash and that was how they met
25:49 uff she got Bunda
imagine if alcohol and drugs had the same protein level as chicken, harry would be a monster
I like ur cut g
5:42 I’ve been there and that doughnut is soooooo good
Can't people just subscribe ?!
JJ’s team: *intense workout*  Josh’s team: haha camera go zoom
WE WANT MORE SIDEMEN SPORT PLS
46:51 far right of Lux🤫
Ksi is still fat tho
Tobi do be looking like a drug dealer tho 14:07
Jj is actually not fat anymore
25.54 on the treadmill
25:50 someone know the name of the girl in de back? Just asking for a friend🌚
that booty @25:50
do a vid like this again and keep the same teams but switch the challenge
Who else googled how to play squash after this vid
I just remember that today is sidemen Sunday 😩
This is literally that episode of suite life of Zach and Cody where Maddie tries to gain weight and London tries to lose it
the lady at 25:52s got bound still
why was this video so funny
34:35 TOBi's goated
Vik and jj should play chess boxing
fam since when was Harry so physically fit
That fries cant be 1000kl
Aight we need to see Harry vs JJ ASAP
25:47 background Thank me later
vik complaining ab his heartrate and hes not even doing a cardio excersise
Sidemen X Nelk maybe ?
26:00 harry lackin
Harry is looking strong af lately. Amazing lad
....
This is the chance that JJ had to show us that he’s not bulking. He definitely tried to do that.
They should do the same thing again soon a part 2 but swap over see if they can beat the other teams score
13:43 lol
Let me guess the next video is going to be the reverse  Explanation:  Harry, jj, callux, vik: are going to eat Simon, tobi, josh, ethan: are going to train
*YO... Explain why the Sidemen haven’t reached 10M Subscribers?!?!?*
We just not gunna talk about the girl in the back at 25:38 ? Thank me later
45:34 Iron Man be doing a madness.  Ehtan be like: “Mr. Stark I don’t feel so good.”
24:25 he is swearing like he lives in the netherlands😂 (Real dutch people know what i mean)
All those years of dedication from ethan has paid off
43:18 "hold tight Jesus" 😂😂
We are waiting for the Gordon Ramsey episode
Bro these calories eating guys should be working out next time bro
Callux sweating on his belly button lmao 13:50 btw
ethan coming first place in his game : “it’s me it’s me it’s always gonna be me” * coming secound* “noooooo”
who else wanted him to move at 25:49 to see that cake behind him lol
25:50
Banger as always
Nobody: Everyone in comment: talking about Harry
Jjs form is good but hes getting slow man speed it up fatty
25:53 We just going to ignore the huge Bunda behind Leon?
anyone know what the watch is called
Why no one is giving credits to the fatneek he was a beast today
They should do this again but switch sides so simons team does Exercise and JJ’s team dies eating
Sidemen please don’t stop uploading even if the channel doesnt reach 10m before 2021. I might get depressed fr
this video was so fun.
do the gym challenge again see who can lift the most
25:48 for the boys only ;)
43:09 SteveWillDoIt!!!
25:51 bunda
So Ethan is the real bully!!!
simon was trained to putvthe cupcake like this  if  u know what i meaj
Want 10 mil give us sidemen cook with Gordon Ramsay
My grandpa held the world record for the longest squash game
why do I get sad everytime these videos end
Alternate title: sidemen play Callux at squash for 15 minutes
Everytime when I watch eating videos from the sidemen I always get hungry like why 😖😖
JJ having a good boxing trainer who train a lot of pros and having leon for fitness would make him a beast we never seen before
Tobi lowkey hit that at 34:34
I feel like I’ve seen this video from them multiple times
46:50 green bottoms
25:50 she got the fatty
there was just a little bit of simon in that tracksuit
anyone noticed the guy at 21:44 ?
6:30 Vikks broken his shoulder again 💀👀👀
Them playing a car game at the arcade brought back gta5 race vibes
Ksi vs Harry in the gym, that’s a video I’d love to see
We need a part 2 where Ethan’s team does exercise and Harry’s team eats 😅
ethan definitely porked that girl at 36:50
what this video has showed me is that jj is a beast , no wonder he won against logan
Up the toffees
I love how JJwas like saying he is better than all of them although Harry is bossing it
props to jj on the rowing machine, he went ham
Next sidemen Sunday idea: 100 push ups a day for a month
Make a part 2 when they switch
What I learned from this video is that Harry is a champ
The relationship between tobi and the toy Iron man is just beautiful😂😢🤧
We need a hide and seek video
Am l the only one that thinks, Harry could be an incredible boxer/take working out seriously ?
45:42 thank me later
Callux is turning Dutch, the dude is cussing with cancer
Y’all do be sleepin on Harry tho
Simon looking sick🔥🔥
25:52 ay yo i loooove Leon's shoulder mate. Never loved it more
Do a gaming vid with Mello
Is it just me or the walls look like  there gray but then I realised it was from the squash
This explains Ethan looking chubby in the football challenge
Harry is an absolute unit this video
Jj should go on I’m a. Celeb
Callus says: I hate it when I am not good at stuff : wins 30 squash rounds
Yes comments
WAIT THERE NOT WEARING MASKS?
This video was a stinker
Why is every single comment here about Harry?
25:45 What did Leo say?
25:45 girl in the back got bundah
Love how the video was made The back and forth transition from serious workout to just four friends stuffing their faces with food. The group with Kon recording and the one with themselves recording. The really intense group and the other just chilling and laughing.
Harry, Vikk, and JJ isn’t a combo we usually get... I like it
min 26 mhm nice cake
can't wait for jj's subreddit to be full of nothing but "so proud of our fatneek finally exercising" each with like 15 different awards
they should do a part 2 but change the teams
Y’all need to understand this isn’t Harry’s first time in the gym, he used to train a lot back in the day but he stopped due to I guess his alcoholic tendencies
31:09 is that Ali A?
12:22 were is his legs !!!!
25:47
Why was Ethan not using a mask
Josh looks like mongol
25:50 gasssss
watching 1 or 2 sidemen videos >>> watching a movie
Guess drugs do help...
i wonder how jj lost those 845 calories at the start
So no ones gonna say anything about how the Nelk video is in the background at 43:30😂😂😂😂
banger
lux is a beast
Why are they doing another calorie challenge , it’s so draining at this point . No creativity
Burning calories parts were better than gaining calories
37:57 damn stop putting my boy Ethan on calorie eating challenges he needs to be on the other side tho he gaining weight again I ain't happy bro.
Harry's farmer strength is paying  off 🔥🔥😂
Im preeing that bunda in the back , when lyons talking in the gym rah
Harry is a beast
25:50 damn 🎂
39:06 *flashback to split or steal
Is it just me that's surprised by the shape harry is in
Geez they put like 4 ads every 10 mins
Banana
Vik will be massive like JJ if trained with leon
Who else thinks these food videos are boring?
25:40 Your are welcome boys...
45:42 right side of the screen... thank me later
And that is my birth day wish
This is the best time of the week
Ethan should buy a bigger mask😂😂
Make callux an official sidemen member
I guess being inbred isn't all that bad huh
All these boys do is laugh
Leon a true legend, love his energy and the boyz
thumbs up tobi for always wearing a mask 👍🏻
If Harry trained hard, he could probably beat JJ
They need a Sidemen boxing fight between JJ and Harry
I would have thought the sidemen would watch nelk
The guys exercising were a lot more entertaining than the guys eating.
Harry just proved he's a unit
When Tobi won Iron Man for Ethan it was cuteeee
5:57😭
Not gunna lie, big up to jjs trainer. He seems like a nics guy and would be amazing to train with
Like so that they can see we want a part 2 but the teams do to opposite
I swear this all they do on this channel😂
Ethans a bully
Everyone wondering where Harry gets his strength from. Me: This is where he draws the line.
Rate the NELK vid in the background
I'm sorry if there's something I'm missing but why are they not wearing masks? Covid's been wild in the UK
43:12 ok i see the sidemen watching nelk.
I didn't get 50:45 can someone explain
10:07 every PE teacher when the boys are walking on laps
Gaining calories team = cringe team
Has anyone else got confused about the low view count on sidemen videos or just me
I want Leon to be my personal trainer, for real 💪🏼
Vikk bitching about his fit-bit being wrong for 50 minutes 😂
why were they mentioning calluxs heart rate so much?
9:55 callux is really cocky and feels sick
25:50 we aint gonna say anthing 🤫😳
5:45 What I dream about
This was a great idea for a video guys! ;)
Ok but why nobody talking about how they put the squash thingy just so callux can be happy
Leon is one happy guy, throughout the whole of his bit he’s got a massive smile
25.53 look at the background fam
Tobi winning iron man for Ethan is so wholesome 🥺
As a former rower your form pains me XD
British people cook like they hate food
Harry has that extra chromosome strength 💪
Finally Fatneek is stopping his bulking century
-26:53 thank me later
There should be a part were they switch siders
Jj's had many professional trainers train him 24/7 and yet his running form is so bad. And then theres harry whos running form was really good and his deadlift form and he hasnt had professional trainers train him
Stop doing food ss
“I legged up baby” - Ethan 2020
Love how the eating team are chilling watching nelk boys
Vibes in this are ✨immaculate✨
Callux got left hanging 27:48
Harry's deadlift form is immaculate
Bruh England still has Wonka bars wtf
Now do the same and reverse the team goals, would love to see from both sides
‘Bread and wine tings hold tight Jesus’ - Tobi 2020😂
this was such a banger
Claim here before million!
i dont think this is the ideal challenge for ehtans current weight situation😂
Noone going to talk about Tobi being such a good friend that he got Ethan the Iron Man even after Ethan gave up lol?
Not the first time Vik got the messed up fitbit
We need to see the sidemen squash tournament! That video would BANG!
Petition For Harry Vs Jake Paul
who knew callux was so good at squash x
25:50 imma need her @
Here before 1 mill
Harry's built for the gym ngl
Just saying there needs to be a tgf and sidemen colab
What clock are they using to see burned calories?:)
Leon got some bunda ngl, I mean I'm just saying
28:07 Leon got bunda
Get the Sidemen to Ten Mil Subs guys come on, what a great video 👍
Literally all the comments: HaRrY iS sO sTrOnG
Actual title of the video: Fitness Freaks vs. Glizzy Gulpers
(17:06) I can't be the only one that, out of instinct, checked how many views the video had.
43:40 a bit of stevewilldoit yehh
26:00 in the background
1:24 when he skipped to 53 i went straight to the comments
if these guys were smart they would just eat dates. they have bare calories and arent difficult to eat
25:51 in the background tho 🍑
I love the way jj was trying so hard when working out with Leon but Harry still performed better
I wish Ethan would vlog
Leon: Speakin.... Me: damn shawty n the back gotta fatty
Ngl i want that man as my pt he shows the moves well and he clearly knows what hes doing and the workouts seem kinda nice
25:47 :)
Is next week the moo off
25:48 ur welcome :)
Me tryna find one comment that isn’t about Harry 👁👄👁
i love how wholesome the comments are about harry lmao. and am i the only one who thinks they should do it again but swap the groups
Ethan was elite here
Yo why did Cal seem so angry playing Squash in this video
Why was Harry such a tank hahah he did better than JJ and JJ does these workouts like every day
20:38 that chest hair tho
Nobody:  Vik: fuking bpm
Harry vs Jake Paul Boxing Match  Like to agree...
Anybody else notice nelk on the tv at 43:34
Tbh I think the calorie burners were the real winners long term aha
Anybody else notice the girl in the back when Leon was talking while they were on the treadmill? 😯🔥🔥
Not enjoying the eating vid tbh
Thoroughly impressed with Harry and the look of determination in JJ’s face 💪🏻 well done boys
26:03 SHEEEESH
that girl at 25:50 tho, oh my dayzz
Why Tobi looks so sad
Nothing brought me more joy than watching Tobi interact with that Iron-man plushie
Shoutout to Tobi, not only did he actually win the claw machine he gave the Iron man to Ethan without hesitation. Big ups 🙌
They do be looking at a Nelk YouTube vid in the background.
A NEW CHALLENGER HAS COME  a fit bit is beating Jj in the biggest snake of Vikks life
JJ’s deadlift from is getting me mad
Stevewilldo it at 43:15
squash is actually kinda cool ngl
LMAO when to I threw the iron man at josh then ran after him please please lmao
25:45 done us blessing there
Lol I feel so cheeky eating my cheesy nachos whilst watching this...
I hate that I can’t see people’s expressions when they are wearing masks smh.
Collab with pride and pinion
Is it me or does it feel like Tobi is always half hearted in videos like this
1:26 It's gonna be in Reddit for shoes
44:30 right side of the screen anyone see?
I coulda watched em play squash for ages
“I layed down baby” I CREASED
Harrryyy fammm
Harry 🥰🥰💪
Bro Lux is actually mad tall 😂
GOOD FUKIN VIDEO, thats all I got.
It’s starting to feel like they’ve ran out of ideas, I feel like they’ve done this before or something similar. Starting to get stale fellas.
Do a sidemen go fishing
I saw many fatty assy at the gym in the video
Shout out to callux!!!
10 more of this and fatneek can finally get back in shape
Behzinga just pulled an uno reverse card on himself
They need to do this video but switch the rolles
I love this content
Sidemen strength test 2020
Hko
I be honestly don’t think Leon’s work out is that bad
josh appreciation comment
11:42 JJ chatting as If vik isnt the only one that beat cal
Guys bring sliker next episode
I see them watching nelk
Can't stand callux
Cal's belly button looks like it was sweating when the where playing squash
Og.ksi fans know how jj gets bulk
Damn Harry surprised me
Ksi be looking hench 😂🤣😂
43:30 sidemen enjoying an nelk video it would be an insane collab
claim here before 10 million🤍
44:38 Bunda 😂
What I learned from this video is Harry is lowkey fit
Love how Simon Ethan Tobi and Josh were watching NELK whilst eating their food 😅😅
46:54 jj went on X-game mode lol 😂
I like ya cut g
Nah.. Harry should actually start working out he’s got so much potential.
I eat 80k calories every day
Guys I did the numbers and lux actually burned more calories then harry, jj burned the most probably due to the fact he was working out in the morning as well. The amount calories harry burned was actually 3,349 calories. That might explain why harry was out performing jj  considering jj burned 4,158 calories, still harry did phenomenal regardless
37:37 omfg that woman in the background is more muscly than jj wtf
What a stupid challenge
plot twist:Harry is actually going to the gym
My guy ethan using the r34 slyline gtr at 17:37
JJ’s speed on the rower is MAD 😳
Not gonna lie jj is big
How does Tobi always turn up to Sidemen Sundays dressed so fire?
Get these gs up to 10 mill subs plsssss
harrys stronger than I thought
Erm the sidemen are weird
Disrespecting ethan in the thumbnail
All praise King harry the 1st🙌🙌
Legends. Love use sidemen 🔥✊🏽
It's funny that they're watching nelk 43.20
39:58 omg😂😂
harry is lookin wham
Nah jjs form on them kettle bell swings🤣🤣
ethan is a jdm dude
i thought UK was in lockdown😂
1:20 JJ thinks he can outsmart us, BUT NO
Love the content the Sidemen make across all channels and socials. However, I do wish they would intro the videos a bit better ☺️💕
Bruh i cant keep track on the days of the week so sidemen sunday lets me know😂😂
Without those 2,000 on FiveGuys chips at the end they’d have lost.
I just get anxiety they’re gonna hit themselves in the face with squash
JJ finally working out since the fight
I'm happy to see the comments are finally recognizing Harry's strength potential. He is 100% capable of being the strongest sideman he just hasn't put the effort towards it. Harry vs JJ Boxing match lets make it happens lets make it happen.
Please don’t tell me I’m the only person that saw that girl in the background at 25:45
Anyone know what watch Vik has for the calories/bpm??
Anyone else not get this in their sub box
I actually want to see a workout session video with the entire sidemen. The sidemen can spilt into three teams to see who can lose the most calories in a workout or who can last the longest
25:58 🎂
HARRY IS A BEAST ..
25:47 thank me later
Now reverse it I wanna see the other 4 eat now xD
The eating team was comedy genius 😭
here b4 the bots
The Sidemen doing 400m runs, 30 deadlifts and burpees......       Me, eating a double cheeseburger and a chicken wrap with a cup of Ribena :)
what where those push ups jj
they didn't put Callux in the description );
26:02 &  26:37 Kirsty somehow in 2 places at once?
To confuse ksi lets be nice to him on reddit
Add lux to sidemen
Video idea : The sidemen do ksi’s boxing diet vs his bulking diet
99 percent of comments : Harry is athletic   Me: Harry and JJ are on the same team
No one gonna talk about them arguing between doing total or average when they have equal sized teams?
46:00 kon be working them angles for the boys
Big up to the camera men/woman, keeping up with them everywhere!
I wanna see the whole sidemen play that
IM A OG ON THIS CHANNEL AYYYY!
Why does tobi seems pissed
Sidemen become chiefs for 24 hours, who else would enjoy that?🙋‍♂️👇
Ngl this is one of the best cal Challenges!!!!
No one:  Tobi: hold tight jesus
Harry chills on the exerciseses   Vik struggling to do one exercise
Harry used to be so bad, but know hes wham- great transformation for the guy
Madness vid!
we need to see sidemen and storror collab
Who’s the girl in the background taking pictures?
sidemen: falls over im ok    vick: * breaks shoulder*  *Injured arm in squash
We now know why Ethan was looking larger than normal in the recent moresidemen video
46:46 lady on the right's got cake
WHy are they watching nelk lol
26.00. girl behind for cake ya know

A more sidemen video but the teams are reversed would be good
Ricegum been real quiet since this video
Chest up JJ!!
25:50
let's all be honest Harry is a beast like, no cap. Big ups to him. if he really wanted to he could be fitter/bigger than Ethan and Jj
Anyone else looking at the bunda 25:40
Our Fat neek is finally working out
harry do be hitting diff tho..
26:19 Behz risking getting sniped from scaffolding IYKYK
Can Ethan say one sentence without saying bro
The biggest cop out video. No one wants to watch these food videos. This is the 500th video that just consist of Ethan having flash backs
43:45  Special guest STEVEWILLDOIT
25:49 MAD
17:30 ethan when he climaxes
I’ve just realised how muscular Harry is
48:49 that is what we have to do in rowing
Harry should do a training camp, and start boxing
Man the way Simon just shoved a whole cupcake in his mouth was magnificent.
The bunda in 25:52 do 😅
Harry has done really well hes got the size and height...he could be massive
Let's be honest, Harry should keep seen Leon and he'll be a fcking beast within a year. He'll be far stronger than JJ ever was
NOCCO
Getting subs of YouTube videos day 200
I love these videos
Why didn't harry get counted for , the 400 ?
Josh please never say mandem again XD
The amount of ads I got this video bloody hell
43:49 there watching nelk 😂
Love Islanders: 40:09😂
damn harry can definitely be strong/athletic as hell
Harry wearing a fazexchampion jumper

Bruh jj's form when deadlifting
Why is calluxs belly button sweaty💀💀💀
U all know that cov19 has a serial number? Which is cov19 It was created by someone Good luck :)
25:40 she got bunda
Fun fact: Watching a 20 minute horror movie burns down more calories than a 20 minute run.
Its only fair they swap sides now for a video
Ayyy Nelk vid on in background like for  sidemen and Nelk colab
Ethan being so gassed because he has been training and on a diet fo ages and finally he is being encouraged to eat
4:56 Defeat looks like something out of wii sports
here's a video idea: sidemen try aerial acrobatics
Can we just appreciate Lion,Callux and JJ ✨ pink ✨ shoes
No one gonna mention that none of them realised that it doesnt matter if they do average or total?
JJ really needed this
the motivation at 25:52
25:50 youre welcome
Swap the roles and see who can do beat the others score
i think ksi should box jj olatunji
So nobody gone talk about 25:48? 👀
43:12 big up nelk
harry vs deji 2 lazy fatneeks that if they actually train can be beasts
America the most second big Covid in the world . Still act relax nothing happen LOL . In my country just 2 people can go out in each family . There's no going around watched people play music no crowded place looks how many of them didn't wear mask even sanitizer LOL .
Yo the girl behind Leon at 25:46 🔥🍑
Harry is buff
JJ was lifting heavier weights
90% of the comments are about harry
25:40 look in the background, thank me later lads.
25:45 just look at the background, trust me :D
2:50 she's got ...         Finish it off.
This ended up feeling like a $10,000 VS $100 video LMAO
What Fitbit did they have???
Anyone else catch that the sidemen were watching Nelk?
Anyone else skipping to just ksi, lux Harry and Vik 😂
Jj needed this
Finally Squash. Always wanted the SDMN to do this
25:52 oof she’s got bunda
The boys camera skills 😂
Cals belly button is sweaty
Why'd the camera pause when the girl passed ethan during the Willy Wonka Chocolate bar scene.
25:51 yo this girl is fire
25:45 thank me later
I hope we get some better videos soon. This was definitely an improvement over last weeks but still not on the level of some of their others. This was just combining two older videos into one and calling it new
I do like how when i watch these now i know why they want to stay on youtube for so long if they do this as a job man they would get fired on the first day.
i liked for the LUX comment of “right ethan” 😂
Why did harry and jj lift more?
1:43 yoo not try a be wierd but what's the insta of the girl in blue
43:33 aitt watching Nelk Boys I see

Nice social distancing at the end haha
we ignore the baddie in 26:05 ?
big up the fact they're sat watching Nelk
39:47 moo off is back
they should do a reverse version of this if they run out of ideas where simon josh ethan and tobi do the workout and harry vik jj and cal do the eating :))
25:48 the back tho
6:30 if any of the other sidemen were there they wouldve bullied him about his shoulder looool. jj harry and vikk are actually the best sidemen
Me working out while watching this.
Things i took from this sidemen Sunday:      Simon can fit alot in his mouth 😏
25:42 man like Con.
Can we fat shame callus or something? Man has hip problems
25:40 nobody lie where they where looking at  peng ting looking sweet with those cakes
Wy the hell is there so many calorie challenges, get some ideas boys
Big ups to harry, but JJ was actually pretty good aswell NGL, they all had different weights and JJ did his Bit very well. I think he deadlifted the heaviest.
They did a madness
NGL, I'm very happy seeing JJ in the form he is in now! He's actually doing the exercises well!
Harry should train with JJ to give him that exstra motivation. Idk i think it would be good for JJ
Bruh i wish i whase the to the gym 💪🏻😎✌🏻
Harry's strength is under rated
poor ethan, worked so hard to lose weight and then they make him do all these challenges ^^
*Comment section*  *99% Harry*
25:49 bundaaaaaaaaaa
Watching JJ on the rowing machine made me physically ill
amazing video!!!!!!!!!!!! <3
Why do they ALL WAYS spur the wrong number of calories in the title
Sick video idea  Logan and ksi Colab and do eachother day in the life’s together of their training for the fight
Anyone else looking at the grey joggers arse?
Claim here before 1mil⬅
Forget jj harry is a beast
*Ethans team trying to gain calories* Also ethan and simon: ”buys coca-cola zero no calories”
i kinda love u guys
Ethan needs a shave
I can imagine Harry pushing himself to be more jacked than Ethan. I’d love to see him work out more and improve his body.
Eat porkpies they are rammed with calories for they're size
25:40 onwards in the background on the treadmill, yeeeesh
Harry did so good, I think he's having another glow up. The man is getting gains and Callux did good too. He really stuck with it, I loved that.
Tobi seems a little off today
Liverpool>utd
i see that reduced sticker on them magic stars
Vikk missing the ball whe he olayed squash😂😂
harry is perfect omg
30:50 IM SCREAMING
I don’t know why but I just only watch the group burning calories
Don't know if just me but is Tobi ok he was so quiet and inactive
Now we know how Ethan got a little belly.
that was soo nice of tobi to give him the iron man plush <3
I know Toni was gonna give Ethan the iron man, Tobi’s such a great friend
Tobi is such a blessed guy
I know which side I would like to be on......😂👍
JJ's deadlift form 💀💀
Yo does anyone know what fitness watch they were using? Would be much appreciated
Ksi a lucky man with Simon 😂😂
Guys I was having a really ruff day, this just made it a ton better 🙏
Ruins it when they don’t try
25:50 noone listend anymore
Why don’t the eating team workout before eating? That way they’ll feel more hungry cs of the burnt calories
25:40 we all know y’all ain’t looking at Leon 😏
If vik hadve shut up about his heart rate and just done the work it wouldn’t of been as bad
Callux in a sidemen video! 😳 🥳
Finally JJ has had a training session🤣
Another calorie challenge 😴😴😴😴
She was blind 😂
Wtf Harry looks strong but we all know he lost a fight to his little bro
love how JJ wearing the nike next % haha
Damn they got some amusement in front off them at 25:42 👀🍑
not funny didnt laugh
I've watched leon explain that JJ is used to this training for about 30 mins now 25:51
Can someone plz tell me is this recorded  before Harry left  for a trip
Buu
now we need a video in which the teams are reversed. Simon, Josh, Tobi and Ethan burning calories. Harry, JJ, Vik and Cal eating.
How many push ups did JJ acutely do??????
I see this iron man becoming the next beerus 😂
Thats crazy they are playing squash in the same court that i did the other day lol
eat pasta next time y’all do this
25:45 thank me later 🥶
Ngl the girl at 26:50 got that cake
Why Tobi just type pi on his calculator??
JJs deadlift form is not the best ngl
Fitness team banged it
That girl at 25:47 thoo pfff she working that glutessss
17:00 tobi is a real one
Surely another 80000 calorie battle, but the teams do the other ones
Harry and company  actually had fun playing squash
i actually really like how they invited callux into this video. i think they should invite 1 friend (different each week) to make things even (if split into 2 different groups) and also give some exposure to the friends!
Harry 👀
“I can do it on a video game not in real life” -Vikkstar. A true alpha male
I love how Tobi and Simon are still wearing their masks even though the others arent 🥺
26:47 Bunda has been located
Absolute baddie on the treadmill at 25:52
43:16 sidemen x nelk boys pending...
21:00
25:50 all the boys saw it dont lie
KSI, Callux, Harry: "yeah i lost 3K Calories"   Vik: "I lost 2.5K but my watch is lying"    Broooo this guy
25:50 thank me later :)
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday  Friday Saturday Sideman
Time for my weekly dose of Serotonin
3:33 i wonder where he picked that up
Finally video footage of jj working out
JJ dosnt lose boxing matches he draws
It’s not bats from COVID-19 it’s Simons cupcake
Who else saw that Simon, Ethan, Tobi and Josh we’re watching Nelk. 43:10
I see that carrying and throwing the chairs paid of in the long run
Isn't Harry's brother jacked?
43:18 the boys watching stevewilldoit
Tobi definitely lied he didn’t eat anything
Why drink diet soda? :P
I really think I would rather do the lose calories rather than gain them if I was in the video
Let’s be honest there is no way jj did 55 push-ups with perfect form the whole way through
I want them to do mafia or tinder in real life
tbf id defo rather be on the burning calories team
mayby a part two, but the teams would be switched?
They just do this for a living now adays
25:39 there is a great motivation standing/walking behind the trainer
Try this challenge on middle eastern man and 1 man can beat 4 in eating 😂😂😏
Ethan and vikk need to switch teams.
Cals Belly Button.
Ngl we all know this is what jj eats in a day he actin
They need to do this again but switch sides.
We need a sequel
Toby doesn't always put as much as everyone else in some videos such as this one, and I kinda don't like it.
ait they got to to do this with reversed teams.
Another banger from the sidemen
Harry is lookin bufffff
Harry lowkey a beast
Doughnut shop is definitely an essential  Shame on them
cant lie those sdmn looks good but that tag on one side ruins it haha
I don't get the rules of the wall ball with rackets game 😂 I've tried deciphering it
Is it just me or is ethans camera so bad
They have callux he has 9 calories to lose🤣🤣
Vikk: «i have never been so cheated in my life» me gets flashback to the split or steal
I liked ur thumbnail looks nice !
Toby is literally such a good friend omg
What watch are they wearing ?
Yalls brit food looks depressing AF
I m in malaysia and I woke up at 4 just to see this video
If harry actually work out, he will be beast and stronger than ksi and ethan
why did no one tell Cal he was wearing his jumper the wrong way around for half the video?
Thank god that ksi didnt eat .
Most people don’t think Harry has the strength but he’s fuckin hacked and if he pushes himself instead of being so lazy he could actually surpas JJ pretty easily lmaf
Turtle
Harry do be a beast doe 😳😈😈😤😤
No fence Tobi is dead
25:41 bundaaa
U guys should flip it and have jj Harry vik and callux eat and the others train
If this doesn’t show how hardworking the sidemen are I don’t know what will. How are they not at 10 mill subs yet !
7:58 the girl in the back left is me when i go out with friends
What a bunch of awesome lads !
Is kelo here
nelk and sidemen collab, they were watching nelk on tv
25:50 damn that girl in the back 🔥
if harry had the mental strength of ksi he would be unstoppable
Ngl sidemen are the best YouTube channel ever
shout out to all my australians where the Sidemen Sunday’s are actually Sidemen Mondays
Mad respect for lux tbh
sidemen 1 bite challenge
Vik can u just get good at sports
no wonder ethan was so bulky on the cross challenge
If Harry ate clean and trained every day, he'd have a Chris Hemsworth body and Micheal Phelps fitness lol
callux should definitely be in the sidemen, he has been a close  of all the members from the start and it would also mean all the challenges would be even
Was Qur'an being played at 25:30? Genuinely can't tell.
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS SERIOUSLY WHY ARE THE SIDEMEN STILL NOT AT 10 MIL?
should do it the other way around with same teams
This video resembles the sidemen’S friendships
Sup
25:50 Bunda🥵
Sidemen should make the same video but swap the teams so it can be fair.
should do the same video again but with swapped teams 👀👀
Harry and JJ carry the sidemen
25:50 that bunda thoooo
This is some serious motivation
anyone else thinks that simon attention seeks really badly
Joshs hair is getting canny grey like
As a fitness YouTuber.... I would've much rather been eating in this challenge 😂
Does anyone know the girl behind him 25:50? 👀
Next week they just switch teams
How come Vikk has become angry all the time now? Like he is the same in the among us vids, is he ok?
Harry VS Logan? If that is he gets off his lazy arse and get trained by JJ and Ethan
Bro the race between Ethan & Josh was actually sick😂😂
Ngl tobi looked kinda sad
I feel tired after watching this video
W2S the underdog. Who would have thought.
No way Harry doesn't work out
Who was that ting on the treadmill rah
Josh is looking disturbingly grey at 5:56
25:47 thank me later;)
Fair play to harry he should work out for
why is no one talking about how weird and excitable with an was acting this video😳 idk but he seems way different to other videos
Jjs kettle bell swing form is so shait
43:38 sidemen watching nelk
Harry is amazing didn't expect that 🔥
@25:37 thank me later
For the boys 25:48 look at the back
The girl at 25:53 tho😳
I’d rather watch them eat instead of watching them play tbh
Have a nice day 👍
43:09 Stevewilldoit on the tv screen
1:28 straightest punches I've ever seen KSI throw tbh
If harry actually trained he'd be jacked
The only time that jj is exercising
me as a 10 yo: ez
Anyone know where to get those watches ?
25:50 peng ting in the background yknow
37:51 that’s not a good look for Ethan look at the state of that belly lad 🤣 if u go down this path again ur going to make another “How to become Behzinga season 2”
43:25 they are watching nelk respect for that
Simon is a nonce considering how he ate the cupcake
Harry is a natural born athlete, jj is pure hard work & determination them Mandam r built different
I would love to see harry train for and fight in a boxing match. He'd be a beast
U should do the reverse next week
What makes this video so great is how they all laugh together, especially at the end
The parts when they were eating were so bloody boring 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️thank god they had the losing calaries
I am going to treat u guys go to 25:52 and look at the girl running
24:47 in the background🍑🍑
25:53 who saw her in the back👀
1:28 we wurkin' 😎🥊
25:57 someone find her @ for me
Why is it another eating video?
Come on let’s get Sidemen to 10 mill I want another year of videos!!!!👍
JJ´s deadlift form is terrifying. Harry MVP
37:46 pa saleiu 🔥
Ethan do be looking fat tho
Ethan was on point this video, he's jokes 😂
I am really happy to see jj getting in shape again
JJ’s Tuesday be like
switch the teams lol
Harry’s simply built different
Harry's an absolute unit
Viks idea for a video, yet he’s bitching the most
25:45 bundacitaaaaaa🤤
I like to see second part when they change task with each
Tobi: 👁👄👁  Also Tobi: 😐  39:26
Harry getting buff
Everyone keeps saying jj a bully to Vik but he so nice and motivating to Vik
how have I come out of this wanting to play squash?
JJ needs this for real.
The sideman masks look horrible
Harry the king
1:47 THATS SOME PENG TING WAH GWAN LEMME GET UR SNAP
couldn't Ethan just eat 10 boxes of Pringles, bamn 10,000 calories done, if all four do that, bamn 40000 calories etc
Girl in the back checking out big Haroldinho at 37:40
I think we can safely say Harry is a fit neek
jj's dead lift is disgusting ;)
Baddie at 25:54
JJ's motivation on the treadmill 25:48 https://youtu.be/LgIop9jKNv8?t=1548
Saying this on behalf of the whole of the UK. Harry would get it tho wouldn’t he
love that jj’s wearing vaporflys
Unpopular opinion:harry is a better athelete than jj
45:59 harrys lookin jacked
do the same teams but simons team douse the workouts and jjs do eating
Did anyone notice hw jj had a Nigerian patterned racket black green white
I feel like im epileptic after this camera shaking for an hour straight
Anyone else getting a bit fed up of these eating/calorie challenges? Not tryna hate, I just prefer the game show type of videos they do like the tinder, blind dating, the chase etc.
Callux was raw at racquetball damn
Yes
Ethan gettin fat again 🥶🤰
Boys motivation 25:00
finally a good video... needed better structure though
behz is starting to put on pounds..
Man, I know Jj's math is bad but my man counted 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,54,55,56,57
Unpopular opinion: food videos are getting boring
It’s crazy how solid Harry’s form is on everything for somebody that seems to not work out
Harry is the goat
Well atleast Josh can wear the mask properly this time.
They need to stop rinsing calorie videos they’re dead
Harry sniffed a baggy before that gym sesh 😂
18:20 nice car ethan😉
13:49 me and the boys warming up for gym class
simon ethan toby and joshes pov looked like one of there old school vlogs
Vik “we’re getting the ricin”🤔
josh that skull ring is hideous
So is squash just badminton just with the wall?
can we just take a second to thank Kirtsy for all her wonderful pictures 🥰
Should do another one with roles reversed
No one : Ethan : bro
The totals would’ve been 14214 for Harry’s team and 14242 for Ethan’s team if they didn’t have the five guys fries at the end.
It used to say calorie instead of calories
now THESE are the sidemen sundays i enjoy. too bad they got a lockdown in the uk, i like they're vids, but the last sidemen sunday was bare dull
Harrys secret to smashing the gym         got that bandokay playing to keep him going
I don’t why everyone saying Harry was good he probably wasn’t doing it good and the stuff ppl are saying abt jj saying he can’t do it and that he don’t so good and u can see he was putting his all in and actually trying to make it harder for him
Harry is an absolute unit, imagine if he actually tried
I miss the vlogs from the lads
How is Bez single tho, I don’t understand
Maybe I’m the minority but I don’t really find the calorie challenges enjoyable... not hating, that’s just how I feel
U shud never eat somethin in 1 bite choking more comman than it seems
Ive been waiting all week
Vik control in game : 💯 Vik control in real life : 0%
Tobi is hands down the most boring sidemen
The cuts between infinity war happening and 4 people chilling on a sofa were too good lmao
JJ is looking better!!
Vid suggestion: 4 sidemen vs 3 sidemen and a guest They rent out an arcade, and it’s a race for x amount of tickets, then there’s a forfeit and the winner keeps all the tickets and buy something sick with them pls like to show the boys :)
Who knew Harry was good at squash
Cheeky nelk
Is Callux bellybutton leaking? 😂
Why is everyone different in this video
i go to londonm on december the 18th which is a friday and i expect on sunday to see u lot there
the striker challenge could've been worked into a huge thing to be main channel content.
Harry, JJ, vik and lux carried this video hard
wtf is this now and why is it 1h long, this could be good 15min video
I love how the whole video they acted like the total and the average would end up having completely different outcomes😂
He we have a new virus the cupcake 19 created my simon minter choking on cupcake till further notice boris will lock us down for 10months thank u be safe
Bruh tht harry close up at 48:35 rlly shows u how frkn massive harry’s gotten he’s lookin gd uk (no homo)
Jj acting like he’s not rich. Meanwhile he’s playing squash
Josh needs to lose those rings..
Josh is the oldest but in this vid the mint childish
Any rowers watching their form are dying of cringe
JJ has the most elite flop known to man..no cap🤣🤣🤣🤣
Claim your here before 500 000 ticket #nonbots
Do their airpods not run out of battery? 😂
Cal did so well and completely surpassed my expectations for him congrats cal
I was impressed with Harry, beautiful form
Ofc Ethan is on the gain calorie side 😂😂
I wonder which drugs Harry took before this one?  Maybe some testosterone?
25:48 yw
5:25 I can fully relate 😂
These boys are such a great group of FRIENDS, wish my bois were like this
JJ's form is horrible...
They should do another sidemen Sunday where they do the exact same thing as this video (same workout) but swap teams
25:56 stay strong boys
25:50 .....
JJ comes in with the deadlifts with bad form then Harry coming in with perfect form just flexing on JJ. 😂
🤷🏼‍♂️ really don’t like these eating challenges video 🤷🏼‍♂️😅
Anyone else still don't know how to win on squash
ethan looks like he had a different wonka bar than the rest of them
Harry is a beast!!
Pls do this again but swap the teams
can ethan stop saying bro every 2 seconds?
I like how con watching everything and not doing all of the fitness
Is squash just tennis for people who didnt like the tram lines
We need a part 2 where the roles are switched
18:07 Cal saying "alright mate" to the fan even when he's running 😍
Poor callux still isn’t in the sidemen after soooo long 😂😂😂
I love the fact that we are all hyping harry up lol! My man got potential and he needs to realize it
So this should be called the 'SIDEMEN 30,000 CALORIES BATTLE' or 40,000 being generous.
yo jj kinda real one telling harry to get down
no one is gonna talk about how buff harry looks?
Do the fitness side on the sidemen’s channel and have a drink off on the full send boys channel 🔥🔥
26:00 background
51:14 Callux bringing back fat jokes
21:45 GREEN ROYAL MAIL VAN???
Jj aint fat yall just dumb
Now they should do the reverse
I don't really like these videos but this was quite entertaining
100% every guy didn't look at the trainer at 25:48
25:48 oof  she got bundahh
got to say this is a top tier vid it was so jokes
Simon is on crack
43:35 Sidemen watching nelk
Man of the match?
Ethen just got buth for noe reason
Look how kind tobi is Ethan couldn’t win the Ironman so he won it for him hold tight my bredrins from London see u guys soon watching from turkey
The title is so missleading lmao
45:21 sheesh that girl in the background
Bro this motivates me to both eat and workout 😂
5:47 I just had that same doughnut today from that exact same shop
They should do this again, same teams but swap with each other on what each team does
Calab with the full send the boys 🤯🤯
bog is a beast
I need harrys music playlist
KSI wasn't doing his pushups probably. Wasn't proper form
This video shows that they are also brilliant palls as well a colleges kinda
They should of made the title losing calories and gaining calories
Wait callux is better than me in that sport. Ksi "Lets see your monthly listeners"
here under 500k views
43:08 they were watching nelk boys
25:52 has a bundahhhhhhhhhhhh, behind leone🥵🥵🥵🥵
Vikk always has a dodgy Fitbit
jj and harrys team really impressed me. im so motivated
0:09, old simon
anyone else gonna point out how hot their camerawoman is???????????
Be honest, who was looking at the 🍑in the back when they were on the rowing machines😅😅😅😅   Like for yes
Harry’s the youngest and at his prime health-wise. Of course he’s gonna whoop the rest.
the dude they came across is humane hancock. actually a very reasonable guy. would definitely advise checking out his channel, more people need to see veganism as an actual ethical discussion rather than a bunch of weirdos chanting outside mcdonalds
I adore eating videos, they're always so funny
They were the deadest burpees. Lmao
this was not filmed at the same day cuz cons gf was in the gym and was in another shot with simon and josh and tobi and ethan
6:03 ethans das?
I love how it cuts from vik, cal, jj and harry in physical pain to ethan simon josh and tobi messing around😂😂😂
did anyone else notice nelk was being watced on the tv
30:45 is what happens when Kon is on vacation
Cupcake-19
Ethan was on top form in this
JJ has now lost to harry 2 times
25:48 👀👀
Do a Sidemen collab with Nelkboys
is it just me or does it seem that simon has lost weight?
Im sick of seeing Ethans head
Does anybody think the same??   Why are the videos always so long xD
Bruh who else thinks calux should join the sidemen
That girl in the blue at the beginning tho 😳
I was so happy seeing Leon and JJ again
Harry is actually a unit
the girl in the back watch harry at 37:37  😭😭😭
If u ppl dint notice simons team was watching nelk boys
And now the same thing with opposite teams
No wonder Ethan is gaining weight
The chaotic energy of Ethan's group in this video is killing me lmao
discount code?
Man the guy at the gym is so nice and positive i want to train with me
out fatneek is fat anymore. hes just a neek now
Josh and Ethan are literally a superior duo
Viks legs are so small I swear I thought they where gonna snap
34:35, I rate edit the starboy music out before the whole ting gets demonetized
Hello
Harry actually has some great workout potentional
Jj has the last minute wind from boxing
man i was getting so bored and then i see a sidemen sunday video in my sub box, bless
Calux as a new member of the sidemen?
@30:30 Simon Looks a whole lot like Ben Stiller
Callux: my heart is broken Sarah: not the first time
01:46 someone know here?? or here @ 😍 the girl with the blue shirt
But are they counting the lots they also lost on the gained team, because they didnt actually gain that much, there will be thousands they also lost
JJ’s deadlift form was trash
33:59 "This is why I dont lose boxing matches"...fought only 3 and draw on 1🤣🤣
of corse that guys good at squash
Need more of these workout videos with all the sidemen, really enjoyed watching it, like really enjoyed it
🔥
yo with training like jjs, harry could be a mad boxer yk
Fire vid boys
OK so i scrolled through the comments and how come Harry's total didn't count? Maybe they explained it but I didn't see it lol
Harry is cocky and annoying . But if he got 1 v 1 on real fight he can tho . Ethan can too but cause he such a big mouth
I was playing squash yesterday
Who else saw Simon tobi ethan and josh watching nelk when they were ordering the food
We need part 2 but jj’s team is the one who eats
YOOO they are playing my favorite sport (squash). This made me really happy
Anyone know what that gym is called
Harry and JJ competitive friendship is actually amazing to watch
all that music at the gy.... sound like copyright.
Harry is a beast! Must be the Guernsey Farmer Genes!!!
25:40 - 26:07 Only half way through November. I can't
i was waiting for another one of these
Girl @ 25:50lookin like a snack
Tobi has never said in this video
25:46 well well well what do we have there on the background
they should switch the teams for the next vid
How did Harry do all of this with 2 hours of sleep
New challenge for Sideman: Make Harry one of the strongest Sideman.
So that's why Ethan was was on the more sidemen channel lmao
JJ: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 54, 55, 56
Same thing every week but I still watch it
Who’s the girl w the fatty in grey shorts at the gym
Jj: Harry is giving me a run for my money, Everyone else: your just a fat neek, shut up
"I will not give in to peer pressure on camera... again"
i swear on everything Ethan has little man syndrome
Nelk Boys collab after quarantine??
43:47 the sidemen watching the nelk boys now imagine that collab
Callux releasing his depression of Sarah leaving him though squash.
Sidemen play badminton???
Harry’s actually wham
Got to love a Sideman Sunday  Harry has gone from the tubby little toad boy to a tank. Top lad man
Theirs to types of people in this world, the type that would watch this video and eat something and the type that would watch this and go to the gym
Yes the played Squash most underrated sport
I bet Callux will do a body transformation after this lol
Oh my days Josh is so jokes in this one 😆
definitely all breaking the 'Group of 6 people from 2 households rule'
20:55 Damn alpha Vikk with that chest hair.
Shoutout to Callux my mans put in that effforrrrttttttt
Harry is highkey leng
Are they just not in lockdown?
your beard gives me chills
Callux needs to be one of the sidemen. He just fits perfectly
44:30 all the way on the right. sheeeeesh
The amount I want that iron man teddy is mental 😭
I still remember my dad telling me to stay on the t if they did this they would have found it a lot easier to reach the ball.
Love jj's work ethic but harry is natural farmer strength lol
26:18 are they in Piccadilly from modern warfare
Callux really good at Squash hahahah
did harry just call them fries?? i thought they called them chips??
Yes I love love watching grown adults eat food for a video
Yo Harry is massive! The muscle gain he has is incredible. Compare him to past videos he is competing at jj level
No cap Harry is an absolute unit
Fam harry would be a freaking beast if he would hit the gym regularly
CALORIE CHALLENGES ARE BORING
Harry is a sleeper agent, his definitely on par, I rate this squad soo much when I ain’t got energy I watch one of these lots and I’m back at it like a Jack Rabbit🔥🔥 the goal is the goal.
The vibes in this video were amazing
Should do this but the other way around next time
The fact that Sidemen are watching NELK puts a smile on my face XD @45:30
Ethan in this video: this my cheat day by eating food
great video guys!!!!!! letsggoooooo
25:52 the lads got some nice view
What a lad Tobi is, he got the use on man just for Ethan xD
22:00 - is it just me or have i never seen a green postvan
This is gonna motivate me for a week
I love these team battles
I like how it keeps switching from a mad casino to a nice casual run
who else skipped over tobi, josh, ethan and simon scenes??
Finally time for that fat neek to lose weight
Never thought I’d see squash in a sidemen video
25:46 Thank me later
They should do this again but reverse the roles.
I like yo cut g
I think the redits gone gow crazy on this vid lol
The sidemen should do eating 1M calories in a week
That deadlift form is ruthless ...
Harry is a DON!!!!
Leon looks like headie one without the fat head
Where did they buy those Wonka bars???
🙌🙌
Jjs deadlifts were all back
The worst week ever topped off by this absolute banger
KSI was doing so many push-ups he started hallucinating that he was fighting Jake Paul
Is it just me that hates there food eating videos like change it up
What is it with Ethan saying bro after every word
Any1 else clock at 43:10 the nelk vid
JJ's trainer cool af
That da lo sol-me,myself, nd I was hittin hard when tobi nem was first sittin in that restaurant.
When Leon realizes Harry is in more shape then JJ
43:15 nelk on tv
Come on bois I know we was all looking ahahahah 25:47 🥴
video making me wanna eat so much and work out like wtf🤣
This the only time JJ is training
Best part of our Sunday 👍
jj needed this
We want spilt or steal Part 2 with Ethan🔥🔥🔥
The girl in the back 25:46 🍑
they should do another sidemen strength challenge, they have defo improved since the last one
If JJ can’t beat Jake we can call Harry
Sadly the next sidemen Sundays, are gonna be in lockdown.....
Underrated Player: Callux <3
170k to go guys, almost to 10mil
43:19 anyone else see Stevewilldoit on the tv
I like ya cut g ☺😜
lowkey a not funny video but very interesting. i hope they go back to games cause this video wasn't really funny
Why am I getting a Noti 2hours after upload
didnt ask....
They like doing these type of vids dont they
Also we gonna ignore them watching Nelk boys?
Look at all the greys in joshs hair😂😂
I think ethan did Harry's drugs before video
harry isnt tht unfit after all
They should do Sidemen vs Pro eater 80,000 Calorie challange. Kinda like Mr beast, where the whole sidemen vs one pro eater, and they see who wins.
Josh and ethans arcade race was more thrilling than the actual video
The eating team reminds of inbetweeners
Ethan is pumped up for this episode😂😂😂
29:52 when Josh said ayo bez it made me laugh for no reason
No homo but Harry’s looking good yk👀
Big up Kon for getting that booty in the shot
I think we can all agree, Harry the real MVP here. Man's low-key HENCH!
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
Ethan with the upside down mask to cmon gang sheet 🤟
Where is the discount code
Harry suprised me
Harrys form on some of the exercises was 🧢
Callux's words to Ethan what a legend.
i had to order food after this
I was like Vik:- Good at gaming Good at studies Terrible at football  So I became like Simon:- -Good at Football -Thin 😅😅
SIDEMEN SUNDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Let's gooooo
JJ has zero athleticism and terrible deadlift form 🤣🤣🤣 he does not have good form in a lot of the workouts. He does them a bit slouchy and doesn’t engage his core
Harry is FIT
Corona isn't an excuse for recycled videos
Jj doing sports looks like imposter faking tasks
After watching callux playing squash i finally realised he is actually good at something.
Anyone know what watch they use
27:22 that saying right next to them didn't get any attention at all
Skepticism
25:50 i love watching these vids..
Harry is a killer! Smashed everything!
I dont see gordon😡
I think Harry could beat Jake Paul if he started training
43:26 the sidemen watch NELK 😁
25:50 sniperrrrrr
Omg who is that girl in the background 26:01 😭😭😭😭
Those erg forms tho...
Josh's team feels like a genuine vlog between friends
And the sidemen are running out of ideas
0:46 is going on Reddit for sure.
JJ said 55 push ups but let’s be real, he did 10 😂
17:23
17:23
Not gonna lie I skipped the parts when they were eating because I just hate it
Imagine if Harry was working hard in the gym and everybody in the comments is calling him fat and lazy and saying he’d be jacked if he went the gym
I feel bad for Callux
Do it in reverse! Eating team burns next, and burning team eats.
37:21 who else thought they saw old ethan for a sec
JJ your beard is still clapped.
25:51 lads
I knew that harry would be a beast in this video the man has a crazy physique
i like your cut g
Harry put in an absolute shift, he's looking good!
Bro where can i buy Ethan's jacket pls someone
Appreciation for vik👍
who’s the girl on 25:52😟
25:46 nice background view 😏😂
25:49 every body looking slightly right from leon😏
simon looking like hes getting a little older
Josh's hair is looking grey u know, left side of his head 5:34
I'm gonna be honest. Idk how to play squash or whatever it's called
4:50 is a mood lmaooo
Tobi winning iron man for Ethan ❤️
Literally what is the point in Toby
Harry banged it
Am I the only one that thinks Ethan is getting a little bit to comfortable with slapping people??
Bro. I don't know why but behzinga pisses me off
25:40 for the boys
Cal's belly button sweating?
2:53 when jj actually tries in a video
Wtf! Those push ups were so weak hahaha
They should’ve swapped Callux for Tobi and then swapped Callux with Randolph or Freezy
They were at the place the cod map was based off of at around 24 min
25:50 look at the background  Ur welcome boys
me:dying from my heart beating to 110 Callux:standing still with a heartbeat of 180
Thats why ethan was fat in the moresidmen vid
24:52 they are literally in Piccadilly
It's funny when Vikk gets angry aha
for the people who disliked this video         suck your mum
Tobi wins the Iron Man plushie 😌 Tobi gives it to Ethan instead 🥺
That squash game looks so fun gonna have to try it soon didn't even know it was a thing lmao.  Also harry should proper go to the gym loads and do boxing or mma he is a massive unit.
sidemen: yes we gained 80,000 calories in a day!  matt stonie: not bad, not bad...
Poor Callux he’s been in their friendgroup forever but got snubbed from being in their million dollar making channel.
Probably just me but i thought ethan was really annoying This video
Bro Vik looked like he wanted to die when he had to get on the bike I’m dead 💀😂😂
JJ isn’t even that fat
Harry is just one of those people that don’t really need to go to the gym or do too much and be kinda fat fat but is hella fit and strong
Do this but reverse the teams!! 😃😃
the zoomed in part was so funny
Ethan wonders why he caught covid when he’s always taking off his mask in public😂
25:40 that girl is fittttt
Why does this jj guy look like someone that would have beaten up Logan Paul ?
Yo JJ, drop your hips, your back's gonna snap
BANGER
25:52 nice
Fam, 44:30 thank me later
Everytime fatneek does a push up, he pushes the earth by 1000km cause of the sheer size of his fat rolls, not even Mother Earth can take the weight of JJ “fatneek” Olatunji
20:57  Vikk showing off his Indian Chest Hair Genes
So this is why Ethan looked like he gained a few pounds I the striker video.
Their videos keep on getting better and better, so like how tf arent they at 10M?!?!
2:49 anyone else
josh doesn't quite hit
tobi looking after his iron man is so cute :]
Lmao they are gonna copyright strike because of starboy loool
ik yall seen that peng ting 25:55
25:37 if I had that view while running I’d easily get a pb
I feel like Harry could knock tf out of Jake Paul if he trained hard enough.
I’m 15 and 55kg and my 30 Rep Max is higher than Viks   lol

Ethan complains about getting COVID... only one that doesn’t wear his mask
Nelk just chilling in the background
W2S smashed it at gymbox

Cal after Sarah left him 16:46
simon, Josh, Ethan, and Tobi were just fooling around for most of the time XD
“I can do it in a video game but not in real life” Viks sad reality 😔😔
25:51👀
ayo someone id ethan's jacket for me please its bare nice
27:45 poor callux
Much live callux
Props to Lux
C'mon haz
Is it just me or is the energy in this video a bit meh??
Covid is hitting the boys hard I don't even think there was a discount code.
Haha cupcake 19
These self promoters oh my days
Anyone else see that girl in the back checking Harry out😂
Part 2 but the other team eats
25:50 for the boys
Why did it feel like a pornhub intro..
29:40 I swear Liam floated onto the box
okay but when ethan was trying to get that iron man and tobi won it and gave it to him- that melted my heart
Harry and JJ's pushups were baaaaad. Viki was the only one doing them proper. 36:10 btw.
Lux be spittin bars 42:26
37:45 Ethan looking mad thick.
43:17 watching nelk😂😂
25:50 these guys running with a view
43:18 'bread and wine tings, hold tight jesus' 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
25:52 Thank me later
Reverse the teams and do it again and see who does better
Harry absolutely smashed it!
we need a part 2 were it is a reverse
Harry is 10x better than jj
Man said my goodies  We know that song🤣🤣
Like to pay respect to Vikk's wonky heart beat
nelk boys in the background
We need a Sidemen Squash tournament, with Callux as referee
Am I the only one that thinks that Harry could easily be the strongest Sidemen if he trained?
need a part 2 with the roles reversed
watching this made me feel full and shattered hahahaha
Ethan should have been in the loose calories team
when harry is stronger than JJ
#addcaltosidemen
Everyone talking about harry but vik is a beast too
43:15 watching the nelk boys 😂
16:33 Your max BPM is 220 minus your age. Meaning calluxs is 190 he's almost at his max BPM there
Nelk in the back 😂
anyone here about squash and how they call it squash not racquetball?
How does tobi’s nose even fit in that mask?
Zerka bought a pack of tgf
After all these drugs Harry is still a natural born athlete.
“Harry is strong though.....H-Harry is slightly strong”
Bro JJ dead lift for is so bad
25:40 🎂🎂
Them eating 3,000 calories isn’t even that good - men are meant to eat 2,500 each day so it’s not much more
Petition for callux to join sidemen ->
Part 2 teams Swaps
”Sidemen having a normal day ”
Can’t lose more like can’t lose weight -reddit
Josh got gray hair already 😢
Harry has a great Stamina though
let callux join sidemen
Me and my brother had two different reactions to this video... i got motivated to workout, he just got hungry 😂
JJ: 50 press ups done  Rest of sidemen: 1 thousand calories down
reverse it now
Vikk spends half the video complaining about his watch, full of procrastination xD
Part 2 but switch teams and keep callux in the vid
Harry should train with jj because it will be a friendly competition and them both will push each other to the fullest
the eating team were saved by the five guys  chips
Vik really said “let’s get him off”
Leon is the guy who threw shirts at shannon briggs
They should of named this video "SIDEMEN TRY KSI'S DIET"
im soo impressed with harry’s form, mental
They’ve got some messed up calorie counters 😂
Harry’s the real MVP
JJ needs to learn how to use the ergo properly then he would have probably beat Harry and Callux
Why is ksi so mean to vik?
i play national squash and callux isn’t that bad, but i love the fact they are playing my sport ☺️☺️☺️
oh and vick how was your girl freinds bargei i liike curry to
I play squash and this was truly tragic
In 25:49 who seen that thick girl
3:37 JJ is a lucky man...
Simon looks like the person that puts hand sanitizer on every 2hours just so people can see him put hand sanitizer on
Poo
harry out here casually being an absolute unit
WE NEED REVERSE PART 2!
Jj really needed this
Why do i like eating videos
sidemenn watching nelk boys
harry was a beast
When Tobi won the iron man plushie for Ethan, goals
Yesss another calorie challenge!!! I wanna see more workout videos
Guys u need to calm down on the swearing coz u got a young audience...
lool
tobi was boring in this video in my opinion
33:00 Adam Lallana in the background?
Harry gotta be good
25:48 Thicc
Am I the only one who noticed Tobi get Ethan the iron man! Melted my heart!   Also:  Ethan -eat now ask questions later  Is my new mantra! I’m living by that 😂
another banger
If Harry trained consistently he would be a beast! We should make him do it lol
NELK SIDEMEN COLLAB I SEE U GUYS WATCHIN DEM
good form jj
I love how Ethan did a 360 where the cod campaign took place
How does Harry have better form than JJ during gym exercises
the race between josh and ethan was hype ngl
Next time same teams but switch what they do
Arms are weak, knees spaghetti.. vomit on his sweater already 😂
Callux team had it better
25:48 IN THE BACKGROUND HAHA
Peep the sidemen watching Nelk in the back 👀
Simons all tryna predict things and be extra... juts let things be a play out naturally🤣🤣 THERES always someone
It’s finally back how it should be 😂😂 Harry and just aren’t the biggest  it’s back to Ethan cause Ik y’all seen their who’s the best striker video 😭😭😭 mans thick again
only ate 3k in 6 hours LMAO
My man jj said he lost 845 calories but he still a fat neeeeeeekkkk
Their form on the rowing machine is atrocious
KSI vs DDG PLAN ON BOXING  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX2yqVIiUA-dnHFiNyaiDLw
How was the arcade open when we’re on lockdown👁👄👁
They should do part 2 but change of teams
46:00 😉
No way I’ve been to that donut place lol
Lads this video is a stinker
130,000 subs left in 2 months
I'm only here for the squash gameplay.
I really love this. unfortunately there is not subtitles😢😢😢
When was this recorded? Because how tf are they able to go in a gym?
Why is harry so surprisingly fit
I did’t know that these guys watches Nelk bois 43:16
I know everyone is simping for Harry in the comments, but he has already a good shape now imagine if he took gym seriously. This man would be an absolute unit
when is the sidemen gonna do a mukbang again where they all sit together and talk ?
Can y'all imaging how well they slept after that workout day
Part 2 but swapped places Like so they can see
32:57
JJ’s deadlift forms abit ropey
this video makes me want to eat and want to workout at the same time.  i didn't even know that was possible.
i think jj trainer just dropped him for harry
Nice to see simons training with uccing jj paid off
I like how they put the largest sidemen on the lose calories team
Vick and Ethan are big complainers
25:48
25:50 omg the girl in da back
go to wether spoons get the empire state burger 2000 calories EACH
35:45
jj my aman cool vid guys loving world net hood where it loads
If they didn’t have does chips at the end the would of lost 😅
43:30 there watching nelk on the tv
Ksi has a very bad deadlift form
Best vid on the chanul
45:59 thank me later
At 25:53 some lovely cake in the back round
Harry is a beast
“I will not give into peer pressure on camera” istg I love Tobi 😂
25:51 bunda
Harry is fking monster
This video represents their personalities so much 😂
The thumb nail is yuck Ethan eats so weird
POV: jj’s belly pulls the reverse card
That's the bois we know and love
Big up the evo x gang ✌
oi is it just me or  does harry look buff??.......
Bruh sidemen keep doing calorie challenges
gg for toby
Legit what is that wet spot on Cal‘s Hoodie?
watching JJ workout in vaporfly's hurts
What arcade is it? Seems like a really nice place
If Harry was disciplined with his workouts, he would've beat both Paul brothers by now. The physical talent in this man is amazing, gave JJ a run for his money without even training seriously.
No one talking bout how vikks burpees were better than Harry’s and jjs
Harry’s underrated when it comes to the exercise stuff
Do I’m a celebrity next year
They should do this with mat stonie
“stop laughing i’m dying” 😂
Harry fangirls are gonna run with this video
Smashed it👍
This video shows why the number of obese people is much more than fit people
Broo harry if he trains can be a BEAST!!🔥🔥
omg been waiting for this one
this ain't a challange mate this is just a 52 minute fuckin sidemen vlog
I wanted to hear the convo between Ethan and that ’free good’ guy
I think JJ should help out vik workout I reckon JJ could motivate vik to go to the gym a lot more.
i hate how sdmn are the people who stand in the middle of the street while everyone is tryna get somewhere. well done vid tho
25:59 that bunda
i hate fasting
Ngl Harry’s a wham donny now. If he pushed himself he’s easily outdoing JJ and Ethan
Eitan out here beating the huys
Maybe than can switch it round with the same teams on a future sidemen video or even a more sidemen video🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
THATS A THICK BOY 28:07
man we should appreciate man like lux such a sport he was gg man
25:34 modern warfare map
do a part 2 and swap the teams
i dont think any of the sidemen will ever get married... just a thought
They running out of ideas for quarantine but always fun to watch
Harry can get jacked if he took working out seriously
Harry = hot :)
43:22 they are watching NELK 😂
I like how JJ was taking this serious in the beginning. Idk why but it made me happy lmao
I wanted Ethan to be on the other team so Harry Ethan Jj and cal
Harry actually smashed it
46:00 tell me wen yu see it🤫
Ksi : (probably wont) But if ksi loses to jake paul Harry : Yes
Lmao this vid lit asfffff
Anyone saw that girl in the gym
5:09 correct me if I'm wrong, but harry won that, the ball hit three different walls, but still it hit 3 times, making him win... idk why they continued :/
Imagine if Harry stopped drinking and eating junk and actually tried
So that's why w2s hasen't been uplouding
here before 500k
after watching this, I kind of want Harry to undercard in JJs next boxing match
lockdown
Not may until 10 mil
In the US it be easily be done eating wise
Squash was actually entertaining
Vikk,  a hart rate is always with a little delay. That's just  how our body works :)
we all laughed at Harry's tweet. I bet gymshark are gonna be begging to sign him up now
Harry is a god at everything
Swap sides for noxt week
Harry is something  else. like hollyshit
Anyone thing zerka laughs like jimmy carr?
Josh has a film degree let’s just remember that😂
They dont reply
I love how ksi isn’t doing proper chest push ups and have beaten Logan Paul
Fair play to Harry but don’t get it twisted JJ was deadlifting heavier than him, weighs more than him and had to carry vik in the rowing👀 (but generally the Calories burned team killed it tbh🔥)
Girl in the background 25:52 thank me later!!!
Harry got that bayern muchin transformation
Harry vs Logan 2021
Calluxs got a sweaty belly button 😂😂😂
Bruh last few videos jus been average, kinda disappointed. Dry idea this video feels like I've seen it 3 times before. Original ideas pls
One team had fun  And the other team   Well ... has callux
Almost at 10 mil 😀😀
Jj looks fat
We need a reverse rematch
They call that a run🤣
I hate to say it but Ethan's gone on a tangent. He's clearly lost some muscle here and there and has clearly put on fat.
KSI got that Zion Williamson build now
25:50 i know i wasnt the only one who sees that booty 👀🤤
Behind the scenes of Ethan’s documentary
Funny how they keeps gyms open in London but not other spots but the keep schools open uk govs ajoke
Ethan NEEDS TO STOP SAYING BRUV
Give harry ideasso he can come to his channel again
Simon and JJ not on the same team I'm in shock
Calux needs to be in the sidemen
Everybody simpin over Harry, but what about my boi Cal
41:17 Simon😍🥵
Tobi is soooo boring fammm
Nobody: The camera man: 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️
Feel like Vikks watch is menna be little further up wrist and tighter
Next week switch the teams.
Anyone else not watch the whole video and just skip to the burning calories team?
Harry’s a tank. Good effort lads!
JJ really needed this 😂😂
tobys mum slapped him up after this
I think that tobi was a bit ofg today
is Tobi ever going to put any effort in
Watching Nelk...  sidemen x nelk boys?
what is the song playing in the background at 6:45 it sounds kinda cool. Someone name it lol
25:53 ain’t no body focused on what he was saying👀😂
Doesn't look like 10 mil is happening this year hahaha paigons.
Who else was looking at the honey in the back when Leon was talking?
16:59 awww man Tobi is the greatest man
Did Ethan got that pounds in this video?he looks a little bit fatter
Why is Simon looking at least 65 in this video don’t lie to ur self 🤣🤣
25:49 My eyes have aim bot or something
tobi da only one who cares about iron man TT
25:50 some motivation in front LMAO
claim ''here before a million views'' ticket right here
Anyone else find it comical that callux is insane at squash 😂😂😂
do a part 2, with the teams swapped !
The burning calories parts of the video was entertaining but the eating is just boring af
Rename the Chanel: foodmen
respect to the camera man for the great shot at 25:50
I love Harry he my favourite sidemen like if he is yours
Harry has got himself a nice trim right now
Yo JJ isn't that fat anymore there goes our fatneek now hes our're leanneek
The way Tobi gave Ethan the iron man plush was wholesome
Claim your here before a million views ticket here
Anyone else screaming the whole time for Callux to take his bloody jumper off
Is JJ practicing for another match at the beginning
51:15 Diss tracks are back
Sidemen when they don’t have an idea........... Calories video
25:50 Who is She in the background on treadmill???
An appreciation comment for harry. Love the guy and he is so strong in what he does keep it up bro

Harry looking kinda muscley bro 😂 he been working out??
39:50 Cal, that was a bit mad
Leon is wham
girl in the background at 26:00 👀
Brooooo does anyone know what the jacket tobis wearing is called
Exercising was more entertaining than the eating. Can we see more of dedicated excercising videos from the SIDEMEN?
Ethan and Tobi : “I hate eating challenges”   Also them : I’ll go on the eating side :)
3:06 That Really sounded like a GunShot , NGL
One day YUNG JEONG will be the biggest artist in the music industry...manifest 💯🥶💫😈
Welcome to the comment section of Harry's simp's
What is with the camera quality it seems different than usual.  It looks worse
Hate how it's so much easier to gain weight than to lose weight😕
NEW VID IDEA: Eat 10000 calories but take as little as possible weight on
3:40 That freeze frame though 🤔😂
46:34 why they got a oscar in the background?
36:46 i don’t get what happened?
39:32 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nice of the sidemen to let callux in for the make a wish program
Who else thinks Callux should be in the sidemen
Not gonna lie, was sure that Harry would do the worst, but he literally was a king😄
What are those burpees
43:15 big up the food team watching Nelk Boys      can just see SteveWillDoIt in the conner of the Tv
34:34 Tobi is a fuckin alien 👽
Yo josh killed that racing game
Change the teams for another video same teams but different opposite task
Imangine if they burned calories back when Ethan was big
the way Tobi kept the Iron Man
Yo that girl at 37:35 was eying Harry 👀
Callux 8 th sidemen?
Skip to 25:20 for a surprise
29:21 there's literally a guy lifting 0 weights ! XD
37:39 girl checking them youths out
JJ's team actually went off, that was nuts
Jj needs to stop wearing white bro, homies looking chub
43:33 they are watching  NELK BOYS!
who wants to see the same thing but reveresed
Now do it the other way around with the same teams
why does lux wear the same sweatpants every video?
the Sidemen are just a food channel now
Harry would be fit as hell if he goes to gym daily.
"HOLD TIGHT JESUS" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
What watch is ksi wearing ?
Yes Harry is a beast but we also need to appreciate vik because he is significantly smaller than the others and still did a great job.
Harry is just built different
Harry could be jacked if wasnt so lazy lmao. That guernsey farmer strength kicks in
28:07 ayo he’s got cake ya know
Ethan lost weight cos he gets roids of KSI and cocain off Harry hahaha
44:30 the bunda on the right side😍

Vik back out here on the streets. Love to see it🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Do this with roles reversed
We have found a new big boy
Are we gonna talk about how bad JJ's form was at deadlift? He's about to break his back.
Ethan with he’s mask upside down LMAO
Harold smashed it in gymbox
Claim here before 1 mill
Harry is a WEAPON, wow
Can we just appreciate harry?❤️ My guy's a legend
New game: take a shot for everytime Ethan says “bruh”
If jj was on eating 80000 calories team it wouldn't have even been a challenge
i don't think anyone knew how athletic harry is
Damn

When I saw the ads I thought it was a morgz video

43:09 The Sidemen be watching the Nelkboys
I like your cut g
I thought all gyms are supposed to be shut? 23:36 - Someone please explain. 🤔
HARRY's absolute MADLAD <3
Harry is such a natural athlete. The donny has incredible agility and stamina 💪
Yoooo, again??
1:29 *jj’s thoughts while shadow boxing* “don’t look like a windmill don’t look like a windmill”
The five guys fries clinched it.
37:38 harry getting checked out
The blog style was actually jokes. They should do a full vlog for a video
25:48 pure Bundah
Now I know why ethan was fat in a football match
i like ya cut g
u do the rowing machine completely wrong fam
JJ "this is a normal day"  Also JJ: Loses to Harry
Harry is an absolute unit tbh
Can we just talk about Harry for a sec
36:12  omfj that scared me
Wish I knew jjs whole workout regimen
Do 100,000 calories battle and switch up the teams for next week sidemen Sunday
26:52 they’re at the cod map
I really hope the sidemen do a NFL workout/NFL summer workout!!!!
Josh is mean.
Not gonna lie.  If Harry starts doing fitness, he will be an *absolute UNIT* in no time.
They should do one of these at a buffet restaurant
Toby just casually passing around my entire net worth
Harry is too impressive
Ethan would be amazing on both teams
sidemen watching nelk boys in the back.
They should do a video where they switched
Vikk's side: Running to Nando's  Ethan's side: Low budget Sidemen Gaming
That girl on the treadmill tho 👀
Sidemen just pure bullying Ethan. Sabotaging date and now his weight!
Jj deadlift form is trash btw harry is a beast
44' the technique was pretty ropes to be honest
Harry actually had really good form
They are watching Nelk at 43:45
like for the sidemen to do a squash tournament
25:48 gyal got bunda
43:20 the lads watching nelk, full Send baby
25:50 your welcome
They all are just so wholesome😊😊😊
JJ and Harry the duo
Watching their technique on the erg hurts wish I could have seen their splits
21:23 josh sounds like that guy from family guy, the one that thinks sarcastic jokes are funny
tobi giving ethan iron man 🥺
also, only 170k till 10 milling in 1 and a half months, thats doable
29:55 lmao, best clip
Nelk x Sidemen would be kinda clean
JJ Acting like he actually works out smh
And people wonder why jjs a fat neek
Cupcake 19 ahhahaha 😂😂

ayye sidemen x nelk boys 🔥🔥
Anyone wanna talk about Vikk's improvement at Squash??
25:52 who else wasn't looking at leon
10% video is good 90% simping on Harry
30:00 those zooms were priceless
43:30 they’re watching NELKboys
25:46 The chick on the treadmill tho. Goddamn
KSI is a lot more fit than I though he was, but that's due to his boxing experience. But Harry really surprised me in this vid. His form was great throughout his excersise
Now do the same but swap teams
ethan got violated at the end
34:33 wtf is tobi doing that was 2018 brooo werido
43:09 the boys watching Nelk.
Callux should join the sidemen
Tobis a baller fam
I hope they do a reverse and the others have Leon train them
Moo off 2020 confirmed at 39:48
vikks mic looks like he got some mad chest hair
Yes! Good start for training for Jake
Nah hold next they have to do it reverse
This is how many people wanted JJ to win  👇🏽
callux brought in the video, doesn't even get linked in the video
Love it
Harry got that GURNSEY strength uno
Ethans mask looked so uncomfy
Liquids only calorie challenge?
3:34 That's why JJ likes him
Oi the call of duty corner
Am I the only one who is bored of eating, and losimg calories videos. Cmon guys do something original.
Everyone at 25:50 👀
No one: Literally no one: Vik: “I can do it in video games, but never in anywhere else “

25:52 she knows what she's doing
Harry looks so good in this video!
Do this video again but switch teams
No one: Ethan: I like ya cut g
I'd love to see more of harry and callux playing squash
music at 37:14??
Ethan ruins these videos. He's unwatchable maan.
wtf josh's hair is actually starting to turn grey
every boxing fight jj's had idk but i can only count to 2
They should reverse the roles for next weeks sidemen Sunday
Harry is a beast and JJ has a good work ethic. I like how Callux was bragging at the end when him and harry won but harry did most of the work 😂. Great video, if ur not subscribed to the SDMN ur a nonce
25:51 👀
This is easy
Sidemen repping cov with pa salieu 😈🤩
Ethan: Trying to get a girlfriend Sidemen: Sabotage  Ethan: Trying to get muscles Sidemen: Sabotage
thats 20,000 calories each!
Josh is it averages or is it total: they are the same thing
people who agree harry's a legend
18:47 I’ve never seen anyone hold a steering wheel like big josher
Who noticed the girl with the big back 25:52
'' knees spaghetti '' xddddddddddddd
Can we just take a moment to look at jjs uneven deadlift grip
Harry is a bloody beast jeezz
37:40 that girl in the background do be starring at harry 👀
Cal: Whoever beats me will win £1000  Jj: alright bet (JJ a few weeks ago) Steals over 90k of Vik I don't think JJ needs than £1000
No one: Leon: simping over Harry’s form
The fat neek needed some exercise for once
27:23 how come yall didnt get your free quran
We want more of cal he makes the videos funnier ...
This explains why Ethan was looking a bit chubby in the moresidemen football video
I am so jealous of this Gym... That Gym looks absolutely insane, sick lighting, a lot of Space, lot of weights and many different cardio thingys And in germany all gyms are closed atm so that makes it even worse :(
This deserves a part 2 with the teams swapped
Wait.. Was that max fosh with the free food???!
Toby is wet and boring
what I learnt today: Harry is a mad lad at working about my man is built for this
harrys got that farm boy strength
Got to 51 minutes then there's a par #LockdownDissTracks
jj done half a push up he needs to go all the way down
The sidemen learn parkour would be mad
What a great video, helping JJ lose some weight
Next week Sunday, they should do this again but reversed.
HARRY, HARRY, HARRY! what about poor vik?
Soon this channel is gonna have 10 mil subscribers!!!
30:30 why is that so funny
Cupcake-19😂
I think thet Ethan is getting fat again
At 0.7
I wonder where the 80,000 came from in the title
What is the point of Tobi?🤔
Need ti do a part two where the teams are switched
Banger
At 0?7
25:50 damn
Part 2: swap the teams.
When Simon said “ because she’s black” I was dead😂
Next vid: SIDEMINE 10000000 CALORIES CHALLENGE
Ksi deadlift form just awful
I strongly dislike callux 👎
NUMBER ONE FAN
Harry did all that on a few hours sleep as well?
Yes
If I was on the burning calories team I would’ve actually died or pass out
what are those pressups 1:16
Simping over harry button here
Am I the only one who thought the team who had to lose calories were more entertaining
Harry is just that friend that’s naturally good at everything
Is tobi on his period
Ethans absolutely filled with testosterone
To sum up, basically just a video of a sweaty, fit as Harry. Guy is unreal 😍🔥
Harry should take fitness seriously, he’d be able to be on or surpass JJ’s level
26:00 cake
Part 2 but reverse the team roles
That callux guy is super annoying especially the Ethan joke-
Ethan and Tobi : “I hate eating challenges”   Also them : I’ll go on the eating side :)
Omost 10m xd 🔥👑🔥
Let's check the monthly listeners of the tennis boy
Props to harry he a real beast
31:00 josh laughs like Mr.Bean😭😭
every time I watch a video where they are eating it makes me sad I live in the US and can't get Nandos
Peek nelkboys when they were watching YouTube
JJ realy taught he can trick us with that counting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ............. 55 56 57 XD
What did Cal Say at the end?
anyone know what jacket it is ethan has
Next do another folabi cook off contest
picture perfect intertainment
25:40, ayo who is that behind leo on the treadmill, she fine. Happy to see the lads had a nice view while training
I havent watched the video yet but i see the comments talking about harry so I can't wait
I got a bad hip btw *gets aired
44:30 bundha
Callux in the video = instant click off video
They doing the rowing machine wrong
Im happy for Lux that he doesn't have cancer anymore. Only a bit of a shame that he curses with it so much. For people that still have this disease (like me), it's terrible...
Banger
No one talking about the cake at 25.52 🥵
Ayo Harry is a lot stronger then I actually thought tho.
anyone know what watches they use?
Does anyone know what smartwatches they are wearing?
Jj is a beast
Shout out to Simon Ethan and josh wearing the masks uspide down
respect to my man harold!!
Why is vik so fragile😂
Its so funny how one team is sweating there arses of and in pain, while the other team is fooling around and just waiting to eat more food 🤣
25:47 for the lads
Harry is stronger than ethan change my mind
This video style kinda make me nostalgic
I know this was idea of JJ because he wanted to earn money while he trains to be fit
3:38 KSI’S dingili dong
14:14vik say right like he’s from Dublin
ksi's push ups are so bad
Jj playing squash gives me motivation
When Vik said “I can do it in a video game, not in real life” All gamers felt that
Me eating chips at 3am: ah yes  I'm doing this right
i saw the tv in the last supper we need that nelk collab
Jj wanted to do this just so he doesn't get bullied for being fat afterwards
25:46
for the free food there gonna ask ethan what a cow drinks
Cupcake 19 😭😭😭
Harry’s form said “y’all go to the gym everyday but I’m built different”
when callux said "my heart is broken" :(
I didnt expected this from harry
Harry is a beast
25:20 damn! Skills!
Yk know what, for the amount of exercise Harry does, he was doing a banger of a job exercising. Honestly if he started to train a bit more and maybe not this degree but maybe 2.5k he would be insane. He's got a lot of potential.
did anyone see that BUNDAAAA in the background when they where in gym box
I wanna see. A part 2 where they swap sides
Callux got mad bellybutton sweat
“It’s easy to eat than to train”                                 -JJ 2k20
Everyone is talking about Harry's athleticism and not realising that he plays fifa which is where he gets his strength 😂  Edit:"That's Enough For Me"
They were on a mad sugar rush 😂
Harry is WHAM!!!!
42:10 I’ve never seen tobi that serious
Bruh how is Harry the most unhealthy eater and the fittest in the Sidemen at the same time
"bread and wine ting, hold tight jesus" that caught me offguard LMAOO
Next sdmn sunday, do the same video but the teams do the opposite like viks team eats and Simon's team burns
Harry’s doing incredible, but Lux really tried with this and was such a good sport, fair play to him he’s a great guy
45:23  that guy in the background lost NNN, no cap
Cupcake 19😂😂😂
free NELK ad had 42 mins
Yo Harry went beast mode ngl
who else is definetly listening to Leon here 25:39
FOR THE BOYS 25:50 - Go and have a look lads
Yo eating
I literally love the Sideman bro I’m from the US but it just makes me happy and laugh to watch them
9:31:bucket head nation intro plays..  If ykyk
❤❤❤❤
Sidmen is better than any show or series... They are the best❤️🔥
Shoutout to the stevewill do it @43:46
Sidemen energy >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Who else feeling jj trying way too hard
Why is everyone simping on harry
The eat team is a shamblessssssss 😂😂
00:00 - 00:02  Why does it sound like Vik rapping
josh is starting to get annoying trying to be funny
It's time for Harry to get into the Youtube boxing scene!! There are a lot of people he can fight with
Harry has the farmer strength. Fitneek who?
Did the old man try an steal one of Ethan’s wonka bars? It looked like that but I couldn’t tell
46:50 fam that lady in the corner right is so Peng
Imagine if Harry and ricegum would have fought. Harry would have ko him first round!
harry could acc be a unit uno
25:40 enjoy lads 🍑
Can someone explain to me what’s going on. Are they eating 80,000 calories or burning it
25:50 anyone see that bunda in the background jeeeeezzzzzzzz
I Spend Most of My Time "Saving", "Playing a Game", "Editing" and "Loading". I Need the Support of All My Brothers and Friends  Yii
Harry's stamina and athleticism is insane! If he trained regularly like this he could do big things!💪
This comment section is just Harry appreciation
They need to stop making ethan eat too much
Callux needs some help a resting bpm of 100 is super unhealthy
while watching this they will be loosing 80k calories and I will be gaining them
Watching it before 100k likes

"Claim here before million views"
I wish I had these kind of close friends
43:00 whats the guy in the background doing
Nobody gonna talk about Harry's deadlift form, damn
man benz actually slapped hard
Lets be honest, the exercise was waayyy more entertaining than eating!!
Harry doing all that running and still chatting with no problem, he’s a beast
Didn’t know sidemen watched nelk boys
Disclaimer: Don’t watch without food!
28:06 DAAAYMMNNN HE THICC
Harry kinda big ya know, gave JJ a run for his money
tbh vikks team was more entertaining to watch
I don't get it one team is burning calories while others are eating wtf

The only person who could beat JJ at a boxing match is Harry
Well, someone was in a bad mood in this vid...

i really like the camera zoom Josh had going
the amount of cake at that gym allow it man
Harry: I wish simon and josh were doing this they are probably just munching down food right know Simon and Josh: *Arguing over a zoomed in camera*

Harry is OP.
16:47 the workers either knew the sdmn or they just got the odds of winning it 😂😂
Has anyone ever noticed everytime vik does a video like this his fitbit never ever works?
Harold be the goat out here
"The one sidemen video they invite me to, it's the cancer one" - Callux 2020
To be fair I think josh loses 1000 calories  everytime he’s running late for a sidemen vid     And my guy at 43:00 on right 😂 idek what he’s doing
25:50 ... Now I see why the boys were running where they were.
And the must go this (video idea nothing speciel) just the same video BUT they switch sides so ksi try to eat as much and vice versa

They Should do reverse next week
appreciation for the couple at 22:19
You’d think the side men would have enough money to get better watches like Apple watches or something 😂😂
who else noticed at 24:52 they are in piccadilly lol
Yoo, even the sidemen watch nelk, 43:14

Harry is actually really strong
25:40 boys thank me later
What’s wrong with jj’s foot
37:03 look to the left
I thought it was lockdown why are they out can someone explain?
Is Callum officially part of the sidemen 🤔🤔😮😶😶
Ngl, Harry has God genes
Callux is somewhat Dutch because he says this is cancer
Sidemen play cold war?
26:16 Simon's face on the billboard
25:50 I am a simple man
17:33 R34 GTR!!!
This could be there last video under 10 million subscribers
Letsssss goooo
1:23 "Zero, zero, zero, aaand zero"
Harry should lowkey train with Leon more
Love the video!
So that's why Ethan was looking mad thick in the football challenge..
This one was fun
44:30 that girl in the back

JJ looks like a sausage roll pass it on 😼
43:35 The sidemen Watching Nelk

Never seen such 1/4 rep push ups than jjs at the start
Sidemen will become fat again :( oh noo ETHAN IS GONNA BE A FAT NEEEEEK NOW NOT JJ) VIK will be a fat pa... umm noo sorry noo! (SUB TO ME FOR MORE FAT NEEKS)

Harry got that natural strength
callux goat

JJ, lux and Harry are actually good at squash

Illvzn’s new jackets🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why is no one talking about how Harry is surprisingly fit
I know damn well he did not do 85
Pause on 25:50. Thank me later!
I love these ones
tobi winning ethan the iron man teddy made my day 🥺🥺
Callux and Ethan’s hinge bio ‘I’m competitive over everything’
The sidemen: uhh we hate food videos  Also the sidemen: literally does a food video every other sidemen Sunday
Since it’s gonna come out anyway, obviously Ethan did seem to gain a bit of weight after lockdown, most people would I believe. I just want to say as a fan that weight loss is a lifestyle not a mission, and I will continue to support Ethan on every exercise that contributes to this whether slimmer than how to be behzinga or not. It’s not the weight loss, it’s the drive to lose the weight that makes him great lol
JJ: Harry is giving me a run for my money Me: yup he always does mate, he always does
My birthday is today yessssssssss
There is an error in the titel
The girl at 46:45 though😍😍
Jj has terrible form for the deadlifts like he’s the boxer 😂
3:33 that was a little too easy...
Vik Complainin Alot smh
Josh filming Ethan and Simon zoomed in was legitimately the funniest thing I’ve ever seen
Vik’s only motivation: 25:40
Great song playing in the breakfast club - Move on Up by Curtis Mayfield
80k calories yh
yo
The cake at the gym
I think I can sense a Callux transformstion incoming
THE ETHAN VS JOSH Race Was the BEST PART (PETITION)
Less Ethan please
here before a million and was so Worth watching looool
Anyone else catch nelk playing in the background
34:33 tobi in the back lmao
we need callux is more videos
Callux definitely adds to the hilarity
Seeing the 'eat group' i now understand why Covid is still a thing lmao.
Harry´s actually a beast
Why does tobi never put any effort anymore?
For these types of fitness videos use a heart rate monitor it’s more reliable than the fit bit
I could do that workout 😂😂😂
They should do a squash tournament for a video
everyone got to 46:46 and look at very right of screen!
The 2 handicaps on each team are tobi and viks Fitbit
That 5 guys fires wom them the challenge
25:46 👀
Ayo, big up vik for acc thinking of these sick videos🔥💯
25:50 I keep replaying this part because of Leon's top tier advice. No other reasons.
Just watched a world hunger advert before the video started lmao
Vikk: his reign is over Also vikk: misses
Watching Harry and Callux is inspiring, harry is op and Callux doesn't give up.
Who seen the bundaaa at 25:40
This feel like a make a wish video for callux
Fatneek struggled a bit
Its kinda sad how bad vik is at sports
I think jj and Harry should make training videos together
How does Harry look the most athletic out of all the Sidemen...
Jesus almighty JJ's deadlift form is bad
Great thing to watch while doing GCSE PE 😂
38:20 Was this Simon n jj’s house?
13:58 that definitely wasn’t supposed to be in the video lmao
callux is funnier and more entertaining than vik josh and tobi he should replace one of them
Claim Here Before Million!
Favorite one yet! Nice job lads
This is one of my fav sidemen challenges of all time 🥳
Callux’s make a wish was to be part of the sidemen for a day
Harry's dedication tho
Callux should be part of the sidemen
There are two types of people in this world 😁😁 The tryhards : 15:01 and the   IDGAF : 15:14
I like
JJs deadlift form is atrocious
25:50 we got the bunda in the back
Why’s every comment about Harry’s fitness 😂
They should do a part 2 and switch what group eats and what group exercise
H- Harry......Harry's an absolute beast..... Ô. Ô
do a part 2 but switch the roles
Calluxcancer
Need Subs
This is why sidemen need a house. Giant gym
God tier
Was there no discount code 😂
Do it again and let harry vik lux and jj eat and the other ones sport
callux is hilarious xD
22 min everyone's most hated map
This is a terrible ad for the sdmn masks. As bad as the formula 1 ones.
3,500 calories is easy, as an American I eat that on the daily
now i know why ethan has been getting fatter lately btw ethan u still are in great shape
Claim here before million
Hey i think there is a video in your ad
39:23 the transition tho😂😂
25:55 dammmmm
Man put his mask on the ground I-
I eat 3500 cals with no struggle and i am not fat
They should do this again and swap the roles around
43:16 Stevewilldoit
Harry finissed JJ with his form. Absolute Beast of a Man
I was confused in the beginning, i saw them eating then doing exercises like wtf😂
“Can I get a fote o”
Is jj even this fat
I eat 50,000 calories a day this is NOTHING
Bruh Josh drift was smooth
Am I just fat or does 10k calories seem easy to eat
Harry, JJ and Vik : about to pull off a huge win  Five Guys fries: *corner taken quickly..... Origiiiiiiiiiiii*
FINALLY
Legit though Vik had mad chest hair when they was at nandos
The number of pushups JJ skipped ⬇️
Ethan: Put it in ur mouth Josh: 🥴
survivor of cancer "oh cancer this is so fast" probably heard that one from the doctors
Guys what's JJs watch ?
10:05 why is Callum’s belly button sweating
Sidemen so close to 10 million !!
The workout could of been another video 😂!!
im starting to hate Callux
lux has mad skills tbh
Watching them row is horrendous
25:46 👀👀
Starbucks most calorific drinks contain like 530 calories, maybe something to consider...
good to know the fat neek lost weight 😁
46:00
JJ already burned 845 calories before he woke up. That means he failed No Nut November.
4:45 demonitised your selves for leaving the c word in
I swear the start like the first 10secs sounds like a song
ethan should buy a nissan r34 and make vids on it
U guys know that JJ was doing heavier weights and going faster in the treadmill
Harry went beast mode
I love the sidemen ❤️
Claim your before 1 million tickets here.
Weel
25:40 she bad
43:37 Nelk Boys
TBH HARRY HAS THE BEST WORK ETHIC ...
Am I the only one that skipped through to the exercise parts of the video
hi
jj bouta get a allergic reaction next time kissing simon
Can we appreciate how much effort Kon and the crew put in to keep up and film with the Sidemen? Especially with the fitness group.
24:42 the girl in the back 🤷‍♂️
Yo, harry is actually a beast in this video, he put 110% into this video !
stoned sidemen would bang out bare calories no cap!
Jjs form is shocking
nextweek sidemen Sunday: being lux's assistants fir a week
JJ vs sidemen in boxing,against each one
the lot that had to eat should have won by 10k plus. pretty poor effort tbh
Harry could be a freaking bodybuilder if he played attention to gym work like jj
25:49 boys i think i might fail no nut
One lady in the gym's got BUNDA!
when will jj stop being a fat neek
LOVEEEE THESE VIDEOSSSS
Nice
31:55 Does anyone know what camera Josh is using when he was showing of his hog
Despite Harry's group working out like Beasts they still lost 😂😂
1:26
46:56 background?
petition to make callux the 8th sidemen
lol I got a Pringles ad
JJ still looks fat
Vik is probs so mad that he’s gunna sue his Fitbit company
Anyone clocking that callux is swearing from his belly button and not armpits 🤔
Now we know why we have fat ethan back cuss of all these eating challenges😂
the sidemen makes my day better 👍🏼
Thumbs up for the GOOD BOY at 24:47 - Put your litter in the bin people! Not only is it bad for the environment, it also contributes to people's depression. Nobody wants to see it!
Tobi takimg care of that iron man toy brought back memories from the sidemen become parents video lol.
25:50 Got my attention  Alsooo.....       Get Sidemen to 10 MIL!
Vik: next up we have a training session, it's going to be real tough   Then Camera points back at the other group playing mario racing in an arcade 😂
It’s only fair they do it the other way with the same teams
This will do jj a world of good, he needs to loose weight😂
1:46 the blue girl <3
Jj dead after 3 minutes in
43:11 even the sidemen watch Nelk
Ngl Harry should train to fight someone he's an absolute unit
In the beginning i thought this was gonna evolve to a crappy vik-rap
Fair Play harry and JJ done mega well in this
Harry’s form when lifting is SO much better than JJ’s it’s crazy
harolds a beast
If this was 4yrs ago Ethan would have no calories to gain 😂🤣😂 And Vikk would have none to lose😂🤣
What is this vlogging or is it my eyes
11:43  JJ: Vik has no hope  Me wondering how jj can still bully him like that even tho he beat callux twice as the only one lmao
JJ at the begining of the video =  JJ at the end of the video, hasen't lost a gram. 😑🙁 Rip in the chat for JJ's condition
36:48 can someonw explain what happened there 😂🤣
Respect to Callux for the sportsmanship though!!!
Denmark in chat!!🇩🇰
harry is the only one that is properly rowing
at 00:07 they are at crystal palace, where i went back in year 6 LMAO
the chicks in the back are checkin yall out 37:39
25:47 Ik what I was looking at and it wasn’t Leon
25:49 mhm that girl behind him 👀👀
Rumour has it E.T group adjust their masks triple the amount of calories they ate
43:20 sidemen watching some nelkboyssss
We need another one of this, but Ethan, Simon, Josh, and Tobi have to workout this time
I've done 1k calories and I'm only 13mins into the video
29:40 yo that landing tho
Harry is strong as hell..
Yet even more Calories
This makes me wanna eat and workout at the same time...
The eating group were so toxic to each other 😂
I would absolutely destroy cal at squash
Harry's got INSANE conditioning tbf
JJ gonna get injured if he doesnt fix his deadlift form
This was good for Harry
Ok well I'll just be here waiting on another video
Who else saw that they were watching nelk
big up sidemen watching nelk at simons place. we need them to collab
Me: I can't wait to watch a nice sidemen video without being interrupted  Ads: hehehe
I’m 14 and I’m better than them at squash 😅
Rematch but chance the teams. Same teams but the teams chance about the eating and training
As a amateur 16 bout amateur boxer myself, I would love to do the type of training with Leon that they are doing. My idea of heaven😂😂💪💪
ethan: i don't think we'll be doing another food video  this video: *i don't think so*
37:36 harry getting checked out
Lux just got an new subscriber 👌

25:46 🍑
Claim your here before 1 million views here
Harry to train for a boxing match once this Corona has F**ked off. I reckon he could bang!
Who else just watched eddie eats america?
Video idea:visit the worlds best super marker and spend £100000
JJ- a fat neek who laughs too much...KSI-multi millionaire, pro boxer, pro squash player, music artist and 20 mill subs
Burning team: guys my hearts gonna explode lets stop the video Gaining team: mmm this is actually fire i like the texture and also goes to the arcade and has some fun And they still won
These camera shots and angles are main channel material, bruv.
Just eat JJ
43:19 they be watching NELK BOYS 👀
25:53 Bundahhhh
Wtf was JJ doing on the row machine 😂😂😂😂
same videos over and over 🙄
Jj foot what happened
FatHornykid
y is tobi wearing a poor boy mask???????
Jj in gym omg are we dreaming
Harry has 500$ shoes for a video
Vik makes it so painful to watch, no offense he just a lil cringe innit.
Ngl Harry’s form is quite impressive
If the boys ever added an 8th member my vote would be Lux
where is that gym?
Look at my name and if it’s not gryph I’m dead
why does jj always wear those wet trainers
SIDEMEN should collab with the NELK boysss. id love to see that one day
Harry is a Legend
Make a part 2 the other way tound
Those bars at 0:00 were FIREE
Is it me or does harry look bare pengggg when he’s working out 😳😘
Guys for f sake please sub to them
Bro I cant even eat a 1000 calories
After watching this video I have only one question: When did Harry turn into Brock Lesnar ?!
28:00  A PERSON TELLING KSI HOW TO LIFT AHAHAHA
Top 5 things science can’t answer: why we all love watching the sidemen stuff their faces for almost an hour
We need a part two of the teams switching roles!!!
This is how many people want callux  and calfreezy as official sidemen members 👇
Awww I love this vid so much!🥺 they are all just enjoying themselves it’s so lovely to see☺️
I don’t think that how rowing works jj
Ahhhh so that's why Ethan was looking so bulked up in the latest more sdmn video......
I want a part 2 where they switch teams
Finally something Callux is good at😂
Sidemen Sunday’s just keep getting worst and worst
at 26 minutes con wasnt recording him talking he was recording that booty in the background no cap
25:48 the cake 😳
Bruvsss the happiness I feel on Sunday can’t be expressed
swap the teams lads
Great vid
25:49 sheeeesh the cake on that girl on the treadmill
Someone help JJs deadlift form
Harry’s that guy that could be hench but can’t be bothered to go to the gym
jj's deadlift form uhmm
Who’s that in e back at 25:50?
What is the name of the game on 20:35?
Does anyone know what watch they were using
No one : Ethan : says bro in every sentence
Sidemen x gymshark sportswear line ??
they should do part 2 and have harry, vikk, jj and lux eat
Anyone else see Nelk on tv
I came here at 10 min ago  Ive watched the video and still it says 10 min ago
0:00 my heart feels like its going to explode,it fits so perfect on the beat
Invite Callux to a video then don’t even put his links in the description. Feels bad.
25:48 i gotchu boys
They were all better at the rowing than Joe was on national tele
Harry’s the most fit now
That girl at 25:50 😍😍😍
The food team legit just had a normal day
Ethan says bro too much
45:35, well that explains why Ethan wanted Iron Man....
Unpopular opinion: Sidemen eating challenges are dead.  Edit - I was a giant idiot. Eating challenges are great videos cause none of them play characters and they are all legit.
I'm 16 and i can do 60 pushups easily and this "pRoFFeSioNal boXEr" can barely do 25.
Harry's actually in really good shape
Alternative title: One team dies while the other goes crazy
Sidemen Sunday Idea: race in actual cars to see who is the fastest in a car
12:45 thought that was fan lol
My god that erg form
Week went so fast
Ethan really put his face on that pole 12:41, bare corona u lot
Harry is lowkey getting wam
50:06 What was Ethan making fun of?
I have played at that gym, mad what  a small world
Cool Idea for a video. But im surprised they didn't realize how unbalanced this would be. Tobi didn't even try and neither did Ethan
Callus only sweats from his bellybutton
The zoomed in camera shots were hilarious
Best part of the vid 25:50
Cal is a great addition 👍
20:50 for the boys
is it just me or is harry actually getting wam?
Ethan should’ve been on the burning team tbh.. in the striker video man was looking fat
They should do it in reverse
JJ should be like KSI go out and exercise
25:47 that girl in the background is beautiful! Just saying. Whats her insta? Internet do your thing
Bro harry is a tank
harry honestly did bits . and i feel like the fitbits just did them dirty and they burned wayyy more
Josh's kcal at 45:28 is 4575 and at 47:50 the kcal is also 4575, but they said the fries were 950 kcal so he's kcal should be 5525  The video is f*cked!!
harrys secrete talent: squash
its funny that jj and harry got put into a team where they had to lose calories
460001th
Hi
9:32 big up bucketheadnation intro at the back  Anyone else caught that??
Not gonna lie I skipped all the parts of the eating time, its like they were not even trying.
Leon is scary, and i thought my trainer was harsh
Harries form was good asf
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96dMYpX6TU&t=153s&ab_channel=TheGaffers
Yooo im shocked from Harry dude he would be a monster if he decided to go to the gym often.
big ups on them watching nelk at 43:10
The zoom in bit was so annoying
the competition between jj and harry tho
Sidemen Sundays my hangover cure xx ♥️
so this is why Ethan looked a bit chubby in the more sidemen football video 😂
They could have hit it backwards so many times in squash if the others weren’t there hahah
44:51 does anyone know what they might have been watching on that tv
Haha it was so funny to wqtch them row
25:51 nice personality behind Leon
Please boys, subcribe, were running out of time, use ur moms account, dads, sisters dont care just get the sidemen to ten milli🙏
25:45 thank me later ;)
Its only 11...
Harry is a g jeeeezzz
0:00 beutfiul
I gotta start drinking more wine so that I can get as fit as Harry. That must be the secret
Thy must be making p’s on this video with the amount of ads they included
Haisis
Yo I low key want leon to be my pt ngl
Why was the eating team so toxic
3:31 the titan that ate erens mum
Next boxing match is Ethan vs Callux
lol
Callux to join the sidemen????
The only problem with these videos is that they can’t even be close enough to completing it. They write 80k and can’t even do 40k😂💔
Ethan need to start looking after himself again he is putting on pounds
there rowing technique is shocking
I literally figured out what the video was about at the end when they were sharing calories and that one team is burning and one team is gaining 😂
so close to 10 mill!!!!
Someone please tell me what that song is at 7:45
Leon is clearly standing in the way. Fam, move! Trying to enjoy the video @25.50
Harry really surprised me, didn’t know he was such a good athlete
I like your cut G 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Harry looks MASSIVE in the gym😳😳😳
15:24
Ethan needs a bigger mask fam lmfao
vik waffles so much
JJ has millions but cant afford a real Apple Watch 😂
😂
When vik hurt his shoulder I thought he was going to swerve into a nandos
Here before those annoying verified people commenting for clout
Tinder vids: Wow Harry is funny AF! Strongest sidemen/Calorie battle : Whoa Harry is strong AF!! :O
So that's why ethan put in some weight
Sidemen: Go for a light jog Callux: What if i die?
25:48 she got bunda
is it just me who would like to see a squash tournament
Tobi winning iron man is very impressive
Lol, Max Fosh in the background 😂💀
Get well soon simon, hope they create a cupcake-19 vaccine
The 2nd vid like this could be same rules but swap the team?
Am i the only one seeing tht girl at 25:50 like ok i see u
Next challenge 10,000 calorie challenge with Eddie Hall
The sad thing is my pe teacher makes me do more than the guy at the box gym
JJ Will remain fat if this continues
Harry is wam now
What Fitbit do they have ?
Do u reckon they have ever thought about getting more people in the sidemen
harry is a natural
So this means that there is gonna be a part two cuz teams can switch sides
"I can do it in a videogame I can't do it in real life" said everyone ever
eating team so boring
25:50 Girl in the back
Poor Callux I feel for him
isn't it lockdown in London?
Are we gonna ignore the fact that Josh said:  In in in thats what she said
Vik be like: Àý wöţ ýőř bpm
Honestly Tobi is the kindest sidemen he won the iron man toy and gave it to Eathan who wanted it respect bro✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
the eating group was watching nelk at simon and jjs house and that got me wondering what if they collab. imagine ethan vs harry vs steve in the drink off
Eat first  ask questions later  Ethan in 2016 btw
NEED A COOK OFF CHALLENGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tobi was in such a good mood
i’m too lazy to even wake up
how many ads to they want
I want to see Vik training for next charity match and Vik to vlog his progress. He can do strength sessions and do football drills with pro footballers. It would be absolutely sick. I love Vik but his content is dry and doing a journey series with special guests for his progress would bring a wider audience and he will get more views. More views=more subscribers
5:28 us too vik, us too
Anyone find the eating teams bits quite boring
43:12 peep the steve
25:45 gg
The eating team was so boring to watch
Alright Harry!!
VIDEO IDEA!!!!! SDMN TRAIN WITH A FOOTBALL MANAGER
25:38 thank me later boysss when u see it 😂👍🥵
Woow Harry's haircut transformed his whole face. he's looking chef's kiss as of late.
The zoomed video looked lit u know ...... try doing it more please! It was so sick broooo!!
Badminton > Squash
28:07 leon looks like a gorilla ngl
Harry did good tbh
Simon needed this food
What's the watch called that the sidemen were wearing?
ethan says bro 200 times a minute
25:51 Ai the bunda in the back yuno
Another food/exercise video.... zzzzzzz
Yoooo
Harry’s kinda wham ya know
What watch are they using to track their calories ?
JJ be looking fitttttt
When Tobi gave Ethan the Iron Man plush 🥺🥺
Can we just talk about how much of a beast KSI was in the workouts
Omg I can’t believe jj is working out for once
Who else thinks eating videos are dead now
They need to invite Cal back for something really nice
Who else just wamted them to play squash
JJs athletics and stamina to pull out the last minute grind is 👏👏👏
JJ,Cal,Harry and vik: Literally running across London  Simon,Tobi,Ethan and Josh: its arcade time
0:30 KSI’s beard is still loading... been stuck at 5% for 10 years.
I could literally watch the boys workout all day
how is vik so unathletic lmfao
18:46 reminded me so much of old sdmn gta
I have mixed feelings watching this video I wanna go for a workout but also eat a nice meal 😂😂
Jj forms are trash, Harry’s are better
Hiiii
Harry is actually better than jj to a certain extent, when it comes to fitness
Yo
Vik's microphone looks like chest hair
What I don't get is that why is vik burning calories and not eating
Callux sweaty belly button made me skip the squash section
25:51 thx me later boys ;)
What a bangerrrrr, they all did so well, I'm proud haha
Here before 500K views
harry is a beast ngl he’s good at everything he does
These comments are all saying how harry is an athlete and hes rlly fit
am i the only one who enjoyed the view from 25:35 to 26:05
9:51 top 10 times  KSI got put in his place
I didnt hear anything that he said at 25:40
No discount code right?🙁
Random question who kept the Ironman toy
Proud of vik tho ngl
This vid made me hit the gym somehow
does anybody know where i can get that red white jacket ethan wears😂 would be thankful if anybody knows
Ok, these are getting boring now...
one thing i learned from this video is that Vikk and Harry are fitter than i thought they were
harrys frickin hench
How are they not on 10 million subs?
25:51 jsut when the boys needed motivation to run god shines his light upon them
Squash the lonely man's tennis....
Almost 10 million letsss gooo
Harry lookin buff uno
Tobi has like no chin at all
Harry killed it
Seeing the notification jus made the day great sidemen to 10millu
Why is Harry better than ksi something he dose “every day”
Here before 10 mil
Harry  actually look like he's enjoying this.. I wonder why he doesn't do it more
25:48 Oooooffffff she’s got BBUUNNNDDDAAAHHHH
Last thing Ethan needs right now is more calories
6:26 I dont know y i replayed this so many times
Do anyone one the brand of Tobi's pants
16:55 wheels one as hell
43:30 they watching nelk neattt🔥
Full send 43:18
51:10  "its easier to eat than to train" "right ethan?"  savage
ksi fat
Jj's deadlift form needs a lot of work because he about to injure himself
The exercising was more entertaining then the eating.
I think Harry is more athletic than JJ and he works in the gym probably half as much
How is Kirsti magically in two places at the same time
1:22 those aren't down enough 😂
No one talking about the person behind at 1:45
Ethan: ITS ME, ILL ALWAYD BE FIRST Nobody: Ethan: NOOO!
the first thing tobi said was at 6 minute mark
Anyone know where behzs jacket is from?
25:49 I think I know what. Most people were looking at 😂
They should switch sides and Josh’s team should lose calories and JJ’s team should eat
FINALLLY THE SIDEMEN PLAY SQUASHHHHHH
Why is JJ's form not as good in the ring as it is in his living room 🤔
Yo why is ksi wearing women shoes
Too many cakes throughout the video
Why JJ playing squash in the most unstable shoes in the world (vaporflys)
vikk really have 0 cordination in his body what so ever, man even looks akward just walking
25:34
We just watched the series on how Ethan transformed and now we just watched Ethan go back to where he began in 50 mins 😂😂😂
Hi
Covid really did change the world messed all our lives
It actually was fun to watch the car race
early gang where u at?
Operation get sideman to 10 mil by thanksgiving
How is Harry good at everything
K
45:27 Josh a broken man
this video made me realise that harry is an absolute unit
25:52 who else starring at this beast
Never thought sidemen would do crossfit😍
We all know damn well jj didn’t do 54 push-ups in a row😂😂😂
They should do it again but switch the teams.
43:13 yoo they're watching Nelk the next best thing after the Sidemen
5:41 nah nah that's Ian hecox's pink frosted sprinkled donut
Harry is a beast!!
Harry actually did very well.
Banger video love that teamwork favourite vid
We need a reverse 80.000 calories video
Heart rate doesn’t go on the current rate it goes on the minute before
Sdmn should do a classic fear factor thing that would be so good lime so they can see
Watch from 45:38 with your eyes closed
25:23 that was actually sick
Full English is mmmmmm
25:50
36:45 was the old man trying to take the chocolates ? LOL
25:45
This is the one time I felt lazy and active  at once
If dez lot don’t get 10 mil before 2021  2020 would definitely completely ruined 😪
Thank god JJ is in the team thats LOSING calories....   let's be honest...our fatneek needs it...
23:50
can someone write down leon’s workout? need to give it a go
Want to see more videos with cal💯
Wtf is this sound
Josh is just so dead in this video, wouldn’t even try to eat a donut in one when he encourage the others to
23:50 bunda
‘Build a house for my mum though’ 🥺 Cal is so sweet 😭
Ima need the reverse of this fam
Video idea do the same but swap around the team let Leon destroy simon tobi ethan and josh
25:52 she got BUNDHHHHAAAAA
bro why is this video so dam long
Ethan used to care about how much he eats now that he transformed he doesn't care
25:55 the bunda is a mazzaleeeeeen
Petition for Harry to become a gym rat 🙏🏼
Is this some sign for Jj oooor?
I'm sad to say it but, if lock down continues, we might see the sidemen break up before 2022
the fat neek is finally working out again
Harry’s so fit wtf
Claim here before 1 mil
Do Hell’s Kitchen with Phil plz
Squash
Bet 50 percent doesn’t even know what AMRAP means
If harry took the fitness thing properly he could be a beast
Do the same video but switch the team's
Well london does not look like its on lockdown
At squadh
This is just a publicity stunt to get people to stop making fun of Fatneek JJ
36:24 harry's looking big yanno
would’ve been even better if i didn’t get 4 adds in the first 10 minutes
25:51 i saw it
Bro we all know JJ was capping about this being a normal day like cmon lmao
JI,eathen should be in one team because they booth are fat
Sidemen should do a collab with NELK.
lets get em to 10 mil
I wanna 1v1 callux at squash I play for Essex
@33:48 his manic laugh when vik asks when the break is haha
25:47 Thank Me Later
Just me that kinda wants Leon as a trainer
I see how Ethan got the Rona he does know to use a mask properly
Background 25:41
52:39 is the funniest thing ive ever watched!!! :)
HARRY THE MVP OF THE VID
Hello hovin
Literally no one  Simon: I love cheese
cmon 10 mil coming soon . we optimistic.
yo jj took 55 pushups jeez
as a rower their form on the erg is making me cry
Ayo fair play to Cal- well done G!
Dude, sidemen videos cure my depression
Simon and tobi always acting like bitches every food video LOL
does cal sweat from his bellybutton?
AaAaa
sidemen watching nelk 43:10
Why did Callux swear with cancer
Harry gave jj a run for his money must say
Now this was a banger, not the last one
Harry came across way fitter than Jj in this
25:45
Sidemen play squash❤️❤️❤️
Can't lie this deffoo is a stinker
The next vid should be a swap
Ayo that girl behind Leon at 25 minutes was doing work
37:37 that girl in the background is checking out Harry lmao 😭
why is Ethan not in the losing calories bracket? Isnt he about gains anymore?
Ethan in the r34 jeezzzzz
Nelk on the TV
They're really struggling for ideas now aren't they
5:30  Vik:i can do it in a video game but i cant do it in real life  Same vik same
Damn who is that honey in the background 25:50
ethan brings the best out of josh we love to see it
Here before half a million
We all know josh was drunk!😂😂😂😂
Fair enough to Harry tbf
so after all that its safe to say Harry's a beast!
best sidemen video in a while!
Who wants to see a sidemen squash tournament?
Harrys actually fitter than i thought Damn
Harrys form on the rowing machine was quite alright considering all the training they did before
nice to know sidemen watch nelk
Wtf is JJ doing he's supposed to be fatneek not fitneek lmfao
Calux don’t come in sideman
No one: Leon: *simping over Harry’s form*
Ethan won, but at what cost?
80,000?
Who else here before a millie
Before 400,000
Do it again but the teams swap and compare the results and the total between what each team gained and lost wins
close to 10 mill BOYSSSSSS
Stop ruining fat neek
Sidemen to 10 million 🙌🏻
They need to do this the other way round
How much weight did jj have on his deadlift bar?
25:48 leon move plz
Think we can all agree they should do this the other way round next week.
they should do another one where the food team does the burning
Nearly at 10million, cmon lads Sidemen to 10 mill
Nice seeing the fat neek getting in shape
Best thing (end of the week) is always a good sidemen video 😀😀
25:50 DA BOOTY
Exercise clips were so much entertaining
JJ actually got good at squash props to the fatneek
Why dosent Vik jump while doing burpees?
This man josh don’t not look 28 lls
what are those clocks called
I don’t think we’ve seen that much of Simons, Ethans, Josh, and Tobi’s friendship on camera before. Like the genuine friendship they have, it felt like they were hanging out without the cameras but on camera lol
What’s the discount code please Soneone
Ayone who is into Guitar Hero and want's to know what songs was playing at 17:18 it was helicopter bloc party on medium and the section is Creepy Riff (because josh has full starpower so this suggests that it is creepy rift 1 not 2 and the charting pattern matches)
skip to 25:45 and look on the treadmills, Thank me later
What watch are they using?
Viks laugh is so underrated
Simon may as well not even wear a mask  because he has it half way on basically the entire time
Josh filming Thoe amazing
Eathan looks drunk when he's led on the sofa 😂
Anyone else think these vids are getting more boring? I guess it’s because of rona but I think they should do a goggle box or somet. Every Sunday it’s either about travelling or eating. Still love them tho
I feel bad for the camera man who had to run after then😂
43:20 nelk boys yee let’s go #fullsend
Most intense race car game I’ve seen 😂
0:40 what watch is that ?
Do this reversed teams plssss
Just gonna say all the people who liked BK WENT TO BK 😂
:D
Whenever they do lose or eat calories challenges Simon always wins big up
Harry actually did so well and even gave JJ a proper run for his money, if Harry actually dedicated himself he and JJ could be a sick boxing duo.
LETS GET THE SIDEMEN TO 10 MIL!
Fun fact thats twice Callux beats KSI in a Sport/Cardio event
Now we need a reversed match with same teams doing the opposite
17:03 the beginning of the next bearus, iron manus
The moresidemen video was Way better
Theres such a big contrast in mood its hilarious
Ethan with da: i like ya cut g
I was legit just re watching the other calorie video😂
Here at 450k views
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS SERIOUSLY WHY ARE THE SIDEMEN STILL NOT AT 10 MIL?
NGL I really wanna go and play squash rn...
JJ *at the back of his mind*: "I'm gonna prove to reddit that I'm not a fat neek"
We need Sidemen x STORROR
Someone in Sidemen team wants Fat Ethan back so he can finally have a Girlfriend
How much does a session with Leon cost?
Ah yes another week of let's get Ethan to relapse
Peep sideman watching The Nelk Boys on the tv
What's more annoying?  Like for double unskippable YouTube ads, or comment for reels on Instagram
Let’s be honest this wasn’t good like no one cares about weights also when are we getting side man good trip vs bad trip
After watching this its so evident how toxic ethan is
1k calories for those fries, Damn u  could of eaten 5 of those and gotten 5k
25:50 watch the treadmill bois
wait but this isn't even a challenge, the team that has to gain weight will dominate all they gotta do is sit down and eat
Watching after a good session of squash
Tobi giving Ethan the Plush made my Week, I love him  Edit: Sick One Ethan...
Maybe for more sidemen they should do the opposite like Josh’s teams lose calories and JJs team gains calories
now reverse the challenge (swap what the teams do). who can do the most total consumed+burnt
Callux is so unlucky to be scammed by the sidemen 😂😂
Harry with proper training could become a beast
They just want ethan to get fat
There is a video in your ads
I liKE Ye cUt g😽
i enjoyed this video
YO
Is that Pooja Hedge at 3:48👀🤨
Do kitchen nightmares with Phil as Gordon Ramsey
25:49 your welcome boys
Anyone else feel sorry for callux abit?

Bruno Fernandes 20:40
All Callux added to vid was moaning why he said yes
JJ and Harry are two pretty fit best friends
Anyone know what the handheld cameras they use are??
Im really impressed with harry god damnnnn
25:50 in the back ;)
7:05 vik doing it for the unpaid workers     Why does Cal hear Indian boss music?
Big banger💥
jj looking fit but he still fat
Why dont they explain what the concept is?
Yay before million
Harry come with that farmer strength
Soo much laughter through the whole video 😂, loved it
I feel like Ethan is never afraid to be embarrassed
5:45 That edit on Josh face after he says "Dough" . im ded
U guys should do a part 2 where it’s the same teams but they switch about what they are doing.
Wow the video was crazy op
LETS👏🏼GET👏🏼THE👏🏼SIDEMEN👏🏼TO👏🏼10👏🏼MILL.

Petition to bring in Gordon Ramsey for #10M
A video for ksi is taking deji to the gym with Leon
More sidemen vid- the racing game josh n Ethan were playing
They should do reversed next sunday
Me being thin and wanting to gain weight.  Sideman: Let's do a 80,000 Calorie Challenge
barely 1 hour has gone and the video already has 460,456 views bro thats insane
4:15 That was the cutest sorry I've ever heard LMAO
My ocd kicked in when I saw that face mask barely hanging on ethans nose
Harry's form is so much better than JJ's in every excercise
25:48 in the background;)
25:50 tho
18:48 bro we need a video on this maybe like one with forza horizon or something
They should do this while drunk
Harry should train more often he's got a lot of stamina
I shouldn’t watch this when it’s not time to eat or workout
KSI can’t even do a proper push-up
There them working out hard and I’m scoffing myself and laying in bed for a week
This is gonna be really good for jj's reddit 🤣🤣🤣
Harry is the goat bro
44:29 for the boys
💀👾💀
Surprised Harry was keeping pace with JJ in the workout, props to him!
Ethan hard carry
can we talk about how harry kept jj on his toes and even was beating him in some activities
I like how the groups are split into who likes Burger King.In the sidemen takeaway tier list Tobi, Simon, Josh and Ethan all loved Burger King.However, Harry, Vik and JJ said it was crap.
25:46 Who saw the bunda behind leon in the gym when he was talking about how harry is strong.
Mandem i will smach the eating one
25:38 That A** tho
Tbh if Harry was committed to the gym he would be built
Mf’s in the comments always like “claim your here before 1 million ticket”
Ethan looking fat again
25:51 is all
Respect for Harry
I love seeing jj in his element, no facade, nothing
Has anyone noticed how close they r to 10 mil!
👍
genuinely surprised how Harry can keep up with JJ who claims to train everyday, Big up Harry, that's hard.
My small brother can defeat them one handed bro in squash 😂😂😂
It feels good to see jj and harry in one team😌😍
Think another strengh challenge is needed . Harry and Ethan might beat jj
Claim here before 10 million!!
HARRY IS A MONSTER
Now do a rematch same teams switch the goals
It’s crazy that your max bpm is 220- your age and Callux is 28 if I’m not mistaken so anything over 192 bpm puts him at risk of heart failure. And 180 is close.
Cant wait for a sdmn mask
harry jj vik and lux put in a SHIFT ya know
That rowing for is PISSING me off
I eat 5 to 6 calories a day
anyone else notice the Nelk boys at 43:08
Callux wearing Adidas ultraboost??? Im confused that aint NoTwoWays!
@25:48 we all looking at the same thing👀
Eyo, guys, is Behz ok? He seems to be feeling bad, I hope he's doing well
This will be easy for jj the fat neek
We need a part 2 where they switch next sunday
Anyone else see that baddy in thr gym *no simp*
SIDEMEN REACH 10MILL
Nah vikk that 153 bpm is right as it pumps more blood faster after a workout to get rid of lactic acud
Sidemen: We are never going to do a food challenge ever again Sidemen 2 weeks later: 80,000 CALORIES CHALLENGE
Tobi is boring
New vid idea: Parkour vid with STORROR
The funniest thing about Vik is the way he moves. And that's facts.
Stan Tobi for keeping his mask on when everyone else had taken it off
I like ur cut g🤣🤣
I feel like Harry could be big and shredded if he worked out
Simon growing a beard?......
17:19 I can’t stop laughing
ethan and josh in this were a* memes
what watches are vik’s team wearing?
The girl with the grey shorts at 25:52, that's how they got motivated
UwU
vik jj and harry are my fav trio lol
Fun fact: these were filmed on two seperate days
Man we keep talking about JJ and Ethan's strength but Harry's strength is criminally underrated
This was a decent idea tbh- if this wasn’t the sidemen’s idea then the person should be credited
TOBI was super quiet this video!
Ok i loved this vid
The way Jj fell lmaooo 😂
Vik is so cringe man
34:02 Leon checks out the cakes
So no one saw the bundha at 26:00
If JJ can’t beat Jake, we got Harry.
ROAD TO 10M YAYAAYYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYA
#10MILL
This is basically a 100 vs 10000 video
I ligit just skipp all of the eating part and just watched the fitness Simon's group was Hella boring

Harry is surprisingly fit
i love ethan and josh together😂

Harry is a beast!
Can people sub to me please
Sidemen Is such a great motivation for me on my youtube journey,I am glad I was motivated by this man
3:05 that dive tho 🐬🤣
KSI’s weight changes every time he blinks
Why is no one talking about how Callux's belly button is sweating and not his armpit? 😂
Skipped through only watching Ksi Vic an Harry.
Nobody else seeing Tobi’s engagement ring? (6:19)
26:00 at least they had motivation..
I swear Ethan's got parkinson...
Not hating just being honest this getting kinda boring
Girl at 37:38 checking harry out lol
Really running out of ideas guys
Vik was not made for calorie challenges
Sidemen: I'm never doing anything calorie related again...  A few months later...  Harry: Welcome to the sidemen eating challenge!!! *Bottom lip down*
Look I know he took that cupcake in one bite, but bruv I have never seen someone die over a cupcake. Its just a fkn cupcake hahah
Wait i swear to god the calorie team was drunk for the entire video
Harry is a BEAST
Rematch
Watching vikk play any sport is like watching someone come straight out of a coma and are learning how to move again
Can we just get calfreezy and Callux into the sidemen already?-
25:45 all I know to know is who is that baddie in the background       She must have given some motivation to the sidemen running XDDDD
Yeet yite yoot
all im saying is 25:49
25:52 look at that 🔥
Here before 500k views!!!!
U guys should do a parkourse The thing that nigahiga did
I can explain this video in 6 words "Stuffing junk food down your throat"
How is vikk's fitbit broken every calorie video
Ethan really had a crazy glow up 🤯
26:35 she was wearing a sidemen bag lol
Watch tobis moves at 34:20
25:52 , there true dedication is in front of them 👀, yup , I'm talking about a girl in the gym 😂
Half of the video wanted me to eat the other half wanted me to work out
25:40 look at all that back tho
Calux is so cringe
Do a part 2 where the roles are reversed
Leon makes JJ look like Simon..
i wanna play squash with callux, see if he can beat me
Why is no one talking about the bunda at 25:48 🤔
Harry's stamina is on par with JJ's. Im pretty impressed.
52:39 sidemen watch nelk
I feel like Ethan should have been on the loss calories team cause he is like one most influential person for fitness out of the sidemen
25:48 thank me later
25:50 oofhh she got bunda
Why again something with food or workouts? It’s dead. Give us some fun content! Something original!
This delvo dude do be the new “ray mak”.....
this video has taught us that harry is the strongest sideman in terms of capability if he tries
25:42 those are beautiful packs Leon 😆
Sidemen single handedly ending racism 👏🏽
I want somebody to look at me the same way Ethan looks at Iron man
jj’a deadlift form is dead
Josh really looks like he’s in his late 30s
HARRY IS UNDERRATED PHYSICALLY
Look at the number of adds this video 😤😤
So your telling me that fat neek skipped to 50 press ups.....
10000 calorie challenge: no more eating videos  *Does 10000 calories in lockdown challenge*  10000 calories in lockdown challenge: no more eating videos  *Does a-z food challenge*  A-z food challenge: NO MORE EATING VIDEOS!!!!  *HERE WE ARE WATCHING YET ANOTHER EATING VIDEO*😂
Is it bad that Simon choking on the cupcake cheered me up 😂
25:53 🙂🙂
Why did I feel like it will be a food vid
I was feeling kinda lonely while eating my food😞 and then I bumped across this video😌
do a strength test
Harry actually look built
JJ needs this
yooo harry is in way better shape than I expected
Harry looks fit af
but like is no one gonna recognize how good cal is at squash
I swear the Sidemen default to calorie challanges when they are looking for ideas
37:39 girl is checking out Harry.
Pog
Squash balls acc need to be warm so they can bounce better
harry the absolute fitty
no one:     harry: 8:15
25:50 👀
Ethan probably had flashbacks when he realized he's on the eating team.
whatching JJ shadowbox makes my eyes bleed.
KSI’s rowing technique is trash. As a rower myself it kills me inside to watch
Harry is Leon’s new favorite
WHERE IS GORDON RAMSAY?????????????? PLEASE MAKE SURE JJ SEES THIS COMMENT ON HIS REDDIT GUYS. WE NEED AN UPDATE!
What was the discount code for today
Harry is a machine
Shut up, JJ cant do 54 push ups
Calux is insane at squash
*I like ya cut g*
Ethan putting them pounds back on
What callux says my heart is broken
I feel so bad for harry, he was sitting at his own table at nandos, whilst the others were all together
Vikk calling out the fit bit again🤣
that girl on the treadmill had the fattest bonda at 25:40
JJ's kettlebell swings though 😂
Everyone: I ain’t ever ever seen two pretty best friends   Me: JJ and Harry
Sidemen 2021: eating till we all look like jj
41:30 1 min of silence of the chef at the background plz
Calluxs water mark on his shirt was pissing me off 😂
Banger after banger every Sunday, Great work lads
BANGERRRRR
36:45 it’s Ethan’s Ticket
Not first
What happened to JJ’s leg?
Why is no one talking about how sick that gym is. I'd happily just live there
Pls do a part 2 where they switch
Just the way vikk runs doesn’t look right
34:45
Petition to get stephen in an among us video
JJ lad please fix ur form on those deadlifts cause its a mess
Need to do this again but with the teams swapped
Vikk the G
what gyn is that? it looks insane
Jj’s form looking good 👀🥊
yo I don't remember Leon being that big lmao
44:30 we all seen it 👀
Yall should do a video with the exact opposite where Harry and all eat and Simon and all work out
Anyone else just watch the squash part
Has Harry just finished puberty he doesnt like an autistic man anymore
I will beat lux in squash no cap
Please play a American football game with pads
Too much food videos
JJ said he doesn’t take L but he lost to calux and Harry
Could watch that Squash battles all day
next week reverse it
What we learned here today is that Harry is OP
do a part 2 of this but the teams are swapped around
The sound seems weird in this video
25:49 😏😏
harry is more fit than i thought
I wish Leon was my trainer man seems so chill
43:34 big up nelk
25:50 girl in background 👌🤭
As a pro squash player I am more than disappointed
Why does vik always blame the watch😂😂
do the people who bot expect the videos to get good feedback? If they want views they can't get monetized by 1 random video on their channel. I don't really see the point buying bots to spam random videos.
Do I see KSI working out!!! No way
Ethan says ‘bro’ to much
Harry is a beasttt
JJ's deadlift form 💀💀💀
What’s the discount code
I didn't notice that harry is actually pretty fit big ups to him
Jj im 16 and i can do 60 pushups in my first go then i do 20 more then 30 and then 10 😂👌🏼
Watching calluxs form was stressing me out
The chick on the treadmill behind Leon was thick af when he said cal or Vick won’t make it
Hello uwu
43:17 is that stevewilldoit hahaha
harry is stronger than we give him credit for.
Claim your “no one asked bots” ticket here
Ethan and Tobi's accents kill me! 🤣Squeeze it.. Pancake
Josh was literally laughing and singing at the same time 36:47

Who else yawned when Ethan did 34:58
Bunda at 25:52
25:52 wait what were they doing again?
Harry really out here lookin like he would have done a madness to Logan
Did they actually get robbed???
Nobody: ... No one ever: ... Not a single soul: ... Callux: "My favourite sport is squash..."
Vikk doing Burpees sounds like a bike slowly deflating.
That booty though. 25:50
thats why callux aint in the sidemen hahahha
Harry low-key the fittest sideman  And that’s cuz his forms always good too, compared to JJ who’s form ain’t that great
Change the teams and do it again😂
Jj be looking fit
Jj has like 30 second winds
According to socialblade the sidemens subscribers will be.................................              10 MIL before the end of the year.
Before 1 Mil gang

3:53 That's my Dad's car
25 min didn’t know it was my bday
Sidemen are lowkey falling off
I feel bad for Callux😭
We need part 2 where teams do the opposite
Why is tobi the only one that keeps his mask on the whole time 😂
Harry barely struggled, that was impressive
JJ is definitely the best in squash.
Harry's become an absolute unit
Does Harry look buff or is it just me?
25:50 your welcome
They were watching NELK 👀
I was just watching the other ones
As a squash player It was nice to see the sport in the public eye from people as big as the sidemen
#10M
Harry is a machine
24:45 Toby sounding like hes shotin  cali edibles
For now I just wanna eat man
HOW ARE THE SIDEMEN NOT ON 10M !!!!
I thought yall were gonna bring in Gordon Ramsay😖😖
Ethan looks like matt doherty
So no ones going to acknowledge the girl at 26 minutes running on the treadmill looking dumb thick
16:45 I see he’s still not dealt with the Sarah break up yet
Harry is actually buf
Bruh Leon be thicc
Kirsten wells in two places at once 👀 25:57 & 26:24
Is it weird that I enjoyed watching them eat food more than actually exercising
Vikk just did this video for JJ’s reddit.
Why is it when I went to London with my school (I'm from Belgium) the Sidemen weren't filming near the London eye or Leicester square :((
here before 1 mil views!
Sidemen is the best team
JJ trying his best so he doesn’t get roasted by his Reddit 😂
Ethan and Tobi : “I hate eating challenges”   Also them : I’ll go on the eating side :)
why they drinking zero sugar Coca Cola?
Harry is actually fit like what?
Sidemen the best team go sidemen ❤️❤️❤️❤️🏆🏆
Tobi a real one for that
Gonna order sidenet hoodie, XIX WORLD chain and active wear hoodie Love the merch already got the hazard hoodie!
jj been skipping leg day
Team Burning Calories: Sweating their arse off and struggling Team Eating: Vroom Toad go fast
Harry is actually whaaaaaam these days maybe even in the best shape out of all of the sidemen
Bro there are 12 adds wtf
Nelk boys on in the background😂
Sidemen watching nelk. Potential collab?👀👀
Did that choclate bar just get stolen? xD
Harry is a beast! Damn
Why does Cal move around like a 70 year old, his walking, jogging, everything, spot on man
Damn I am actually impressed by Harry!
eyo who's the baddie in 25:51 on the machine in the back, respectfully guys
Eating team: Fun time and bants Burning team: *pain peko*
the bundah at 25:50
“Going healthy! Got the rice in” Fam does Vikk not know that the calories in rice is 10x more than the rest in the plate
My legs are aching just watching them exercise
Let’s see Harry get the Behz treatment and get swole now after this vid
JJ’s going to get a herniated disk if he keeps deadlifting like that!
Was highkey super invested in the squash matches
Someone plz tell Ethan to stpo saying bro
cool colors
How much was they deadlifting?
Sheeeeesh boys
52:38 Press this timestap then restart the video, No Ads
DJ khalid: “another one” Sidemen: “another one”
Goats for sure
Tobi: Gives ironman stuffy to Ethan *Everyone liked that*
Back to back eating challenge
Yay Diabetes
This explains why ethan was lookin fat in the football vid and why harry said he was gaining weight.
Click here for your before 500K views badge !!!
Vikk saying his heart was gonna explode synced so well with music in the beginning of the vid
Nice jacket ethan
Harry is actually much more fit than he seems 😂😂
34:22 the face of disappointment, thinking being on the losing calorie side was better
Toby said some can I get some frosting, Simon just stuffs the cupcake in his mouth 😂😂
Vik was so annoying in this video, anyone else feel the same?
anyone realise 1 of the camera crew is a female
i can beat callux in squash
bit of a stinker sidemen Sunday if I'm honest.. didn't even understand the concept of the video
Seeing Call actually good at some sport makes me feel weird
peep nelk in the background THO
Hi
It’s impossible to  take or lose 80 000 calories in one day, even professional power lifter take less than that in a week.  Sidemen be like:  “that slice of bread have  1000 calories”
Content right here
poor callux man
Simon: I eat delicately. ALLOW ME.  Also Simon: *deep throats a cupcake*
25:49 ohhhh my god the girl behind leon
Nice content
Funnnn
U know wat we need now is the REVERSE and Ethan josh Simon and tobi have to go to Leon that was crazyyyy😂 and callux to eat wiv the others cah that brudda deservesit he was yacked 😂😂
I NEED A WONKA BAR OMG
25:49 that girl in a background tho
the couple @22:18 are so cute
Calorie videos by sidemen are just great
Nelk on the big screen tho 👀👀
Callux should get an EKG at the doctors 184bpm?!
The eating group's been adding calories wrong.
Only bad thing about this video was that calux was in it
Tobi giving Ethan that iron man was so wholesome lol
JJ IS GOING TO BE THIN 😆
harry seems to be having a lot of fun in the thumbnail
Vik always complains about the Fitbit
What guy is tobi man , Ethan just couldn’t get the iron man so he had to do his best to get it for him all love mann❤️❤️💯💯
Look closely 25:48   Ykiyk
Brooooo! Harry can beat jj after seeing this
JJ and Harry walking around in the next% made me cringe so hard
Callux looked so pissed 😂
4:00 this is the most Vikk moment ever
playing sqaush for 24 hours (ft callux)
harry training like jj, fair play my guy

43.33 I see that Nelk on👀
25:50 the girl in the back
Harry is a beast.

JJ can’t even do a proper push up 🤦🏻‍♂️
Moresidemen need to do squash
i know which group i would wanna be in..
Hmmm rly surprised when Tobi said he’d eat the whole  sausage if he weren’t on cam
Tobi giving Ethan the iron man was so wholesome. this is why we love Tobi❤
Fitbits don’t work well with vik.
25:55 fit!!
The only sport Vik can play is probably chess...his lack of athleticism annoys me
vik is so annoying hes the reason i dont watch the sidemen anymore
Collect your n word pass here
I hope cal is safe with his heart and makes sure he is still healthy often. Worried about him
the bunda at 25:51 🍑
where is 6:15 from?
Did josh play guitar hero I would of probably beat him
Squash I’m 1st in the country for squash so happy nd u played well 😂
Ethan be like: Call this a workout?! Sidemen: ...
Only normal comment with likes  ⬇️
25:40 shorty in the back with the short shorts...😳😂
*GUYS, GUYS, GUYS* *SERIOUSLY* *WHY ARE THE SIDEMEN STILL NOT AT 10 MIL?*
Is this what lockdown in England looks like? Interesting...
25:50 i know what u was lookin at bro.

jj actually works hard good thing that he beat logan cause he is a hard worker.

Claim here before 500k!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
25:39 the booty in the background
bruh
25:50 Was someone talking 🧐
25:45 oh my gawd
Tobi the only black guy wearing the only white mask
Vikk is so dumb as he is complaining of his Fitbit only being at 120 bpm when your resting it would obviously go faster as the blood is travelling faster to maintain the consciousness of the body
tbh if harry actually dedicated himself to the gym he would be absolutely built.
"sidemen 80,000 CALORIE battle" lets goooo
I forgot how funny callux is, good choice bringing him on
One of the best sidemen videos ever

Nobody talking about that girl at 25:49 tho
the clip from 8:20 of them in the breakfast club feels like that type of clip they’ll watch later in life and feel hella nostalgic
Ey Harry looking wham ye know
There’s like over 10 ads here so I bet there on bare money now! 😂
Love seeing jj train no homo lmao
25:40 on the treadmill behind Leon
I beg they do the other way around
The eating calories side was just pointless. In itself its nothing interesting and the on top of that harry and jj were on the other side so they couldnt save it.
ngl the arcade racing was sick
Good to know the sidemen did a collab with make-a-wish
at least JJ wont look as fat anymore
Bro i f***ing missed these type of sidemen vids❤️
another Sidemen Sunday banger
i dont get why jj, ethan and harry arent always grouped up since they are the only members capable of making us laugh
yohhh guys why arent the sidemen at 10 mill yet, we need to hit it!!!
Thats why ethan was so fat in the football vid 😐
Here before 10k views

When this lockdown is over , they should all try CrossFit
Follow @jacobb_4321
As a pro squash player, seeing the sidemen play squash is the greatest thing ive ever witnessed
Tobi is actually so boring. He doesn’t participate in any of the videos
of course it's calories
12:34 why is cal’s bellybutton sweating 😂
black screen
Ethan: I want pancakes They go out for breakfast. Ethan: 2 Hash browns, a sausage. A full English breakfast

25:49 nice
I think we all know this is Ethan’s favourite vid
Vik should’ve been in the other team instead of ethan
Even after this JJ is still fat
I swear Simon has ate the most calories in the food challenges except the one he was ill 😂😂
whats jjs hoodie called at 22:10

Could not focus on the PT at 25:48
Sidemen:We have tons of ideas Also the Sidemen:
Callux is an actual machine at squash
When Toby won the iron man that Ethan was trying to get and gave it straight to him, that was adorable
Anyone see the mad bundah behind leon at the gym
urgh simon’s so unreal
Okay but Is anyone going to talk about the girl in grey shorts in 25:50
Tiny mask on Ethan 0:24
ethan kinda looks like a low budget chris hemsworth with his beard
Why is KSI wearing vapor flys those are for running marathons, not for the gym lol.

Fuckin squash 😂😂😂😂
Who else loves these types of videos
Yo harry surprised me
25:50 thank me later
YouTube is getting verry comfortable  with  this double  unskippabble ads
the old harry would have done it
She was blind 😂 😂 Simons so funny man quick with em
JJ's form isn't that great. His feet are uneven and his back isn't that straight while he isn't pushing his chest forward. No hate to JJ I love him but he need some better form. Harry had much better form than JJ.
Its good watching jj work out again....
Was this filmed before lockdown ?
0:08 if ya know ya know 😏
25:48 beautiful place to stop the video
Funny 😂😂😂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNXhrRZNl5Q&ab_channel=GamingPunk

I like how  Toby is the only one wearing a mask
25:57 🍑
Harry actually very fittt
Harrys wham bro
what are the watches they are using to see the amount of calories burnt ?
do a football video
25:48  For all my boys😂
They should switch challenge and do it again
Is it me or is jj getting slimmer
Ethan used to be able to do 80k on his one
I kinda feel bad for Ethan being on the fat team
i think simon watched faze calorie challenge because they always stuff big chunks of food in their face
Here before 1 mill
For the next sidemen sunday they should reverse it
The sidemen should do a video where each sidemen start a youtube channel and sees who can grow it the most in 1 week
Harry actually has better form on most of these than JJ😂
They MUST do a video with gordon ramsay, a cook of and let gordon ramsay judge. Sounds fire to me🔥🔥🔥
Fatneek knew we will make fun of him if he was on team eating calories and wants to prove us wrong
40 minutes 5000000 views
Harry’s got better deadlift form than jj 😂
ngl harry been hitting different lately
They kinda suck at eating. 4,600 Calories in a day thats like two large Dominos Pizza... in a day
26:02
Sidemen are almost to 10 mil  let's goo!!!
Harry has that Guernsey strength
Ethan’s road to fatness again 2:26
Oi the girl on the treadmill got booty 25:55

😂😂arcade part lit too funny
Boggo low key hench ya know
I have just finished doing an 80 slide presentation, thank u for this video
Ksi push-up form is appalling
25:52 some good looking treadmills in the back 👀
They need to get gordon ramsey on a sidemen sunday
24:50 anyone get reminded of a certain map on cod MW?
SOMEONE WHO LIKES THIS COMMENT WILL BECOME A MILLIONAIRE ONEDAY
JJ too fat to do 50+ press-ups 😂
Is there a discount code?
They should do a who can stay in one place the longest competition
Can we just appreciate how harry is secretly athletic👏🏻👏🏻
I actually didn't realize how fit Harry is until this video... Wow
I swear I eat like 10 thousand calories in a day and I live in America
For a sidemen sunday idea. They should do a boxing tournament and JJ(KSI) would be the host. LIKE SO THEY CAN SEE.
Sidemen badminton (vik edition)
25:50 thank me later
Whilst I’m writing this, no one has watched the whole video yet :)
Noone: Absolutely no one: Josh: So what we're gonna do, we're gonna eat some calories
Ethan every 2 seconds ‘bro’
Lol I was the person playing mario kart behind them 16:03
Jeez watching them run makes me dizzy 😩
*Can’t wait for vikk to get buff so he can bully JJ*😉
they should’ve put tobi on the exercise team he looks so sad having to eat🥺
Hi Simon I live in Liverpool UK
Everyone : We expected Gordon ramsay Cook off this sunday  Also everyone : Our disappointment is immeasurable
Finally footage of jj training
Jj on the burning calories because he’s putting in the pounds
25:50 👀
sidemen in picadilly ?!?!?!?!?!?!
25:40 the girl in the back tho
I’m sure everyone is still watching the video
25:37 nice camera work bro
Harry is a psychopath jeeez
Is there a mute button for Vik because he kinda cringe
No one: Vikkstar123: my legs are little!
was watching the older calorie challenges when this notification popped up 😂
No wonder Ethan’s putting on pounds 😂
I am so happy I am just chowing food now
Ethan grows up to be like his dad
Ey I think there was a video between your ads
25:47 for the boys.
Jesus those ads
Ey I think there was a video between your ads
Anybody else think they should do the same video but the roles are flipped.
I felt like ethan should be on the other team with jj and harry but its just my opinion that i dont think  not really cares
25:47 was Leon saying something? I was a bit distracted 👀
Bruh ksis deadlifts are dead
37 minutes
Video idea: "The sidemen spend vs the sidemen earn 10 000£"
I'm scared all these eating tasks might trigger Ethan I can't lie - coming from a former fattie
25:22 yo that's impressive
Only the sideman can make a calorie challenge entertaining.
Tobi owns his own clothing line and part of sidemen clothing, which both have custom masks but still wears the basic medical mask for a main channel video
Love that they chose the fat neeks for the burning
If harry workout daily he will be the strongest in the SDMN
Can we get an extended version on second channel
This video is The calorie-burning team taking everything seriously vs The Calorie-consuming team being in a food coma and just pissing about with each other loool
25:50 😐

Sidemen is more enjoyable when Ksi And Simon are not the same team

Vik's filming when he was running reminded me of every fight video ever
Josh did a vettel
Ethan is going to be chubby again bro
I like the way the eating team just having fun in the arcade then it switches up to the others running and struggling

The real reason behind these videos is they want Ethan to be fat again
this has to be edited no way jj does this much exercise
Who else got here super early by accident
6:25 let me think of that one car story with vik and jj The legends here understand
That was soo cool from Tobi to give Ethan the iron man toy 16:53
The football video is in the more sidemen channel and this in the main channel     And they are wondering why they dont hit 10 mil subs 🤦🏾‍♂️
Tfw Harry has better deadlift form than JJ
1:27 what are those push ups JJ
gotta be honest great video, but the editing is pretty sloppy how they just cut away
Wonder why Ethan is in team: "Eating Calories"🤔🧐
Reddit cant bully jj this week his squash skills are on point lmao
Its so obvious that eating team wins
20 minutes ag
2018 ethan be like food challenge bring it on
What a dive at 3:05 by the Fat Neek
JJ please don’t use your running shoes or anything but running and walking they are to thick at the bottom to move side to side efficiently maybe get some ultra boost or solar boost (Adidas) Like so he can see please 👇
This feels too much like tv :(  I miss the old sidemen

callux dressed like a dad
Plot twist: JJ  has planned all of the eating videos to make Ethan fat again
Vik is pathetic
So all sidemen videos are gonna be them eating
Why does it say 80k in the title
Callux is massively underrated IMO
cal wasnt lying about the walls being easy to injure yourself with. i knocked myself out because i tripped when returning the ball. smashed my head into the front corner
Jj is losing weight 😤

I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ALL DAY OMG

Why does KSI practice his jabs and hooks? He needs to practice his windmills.
